1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:03,049
Previously:

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:06,679
Prophecies mention a Tro-Clon
that brings about ruination.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,380
Imagine what could have happened
if you'd slept with Darla.

4
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:13,390
- You know I'd never do that.
- Hello, lover.

5
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:14,869
- Darla.
- Darla.

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,109
- Darla.
- This is impossible.

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:17,800
Tell me about it, Daddy.

8
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:19,850
You slept with her?

9
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,600
How are you feeling?

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,780
Get away! You'll be all right.
I'll kill her for this.

11
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:31,699
You're gonna have to find her first.

12
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,850
Go on. Do it.

13
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,649
- Do it! Do it!
- The child, it has a soul.

14
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,810
- No, it doesn't.
- It does.

15
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:43,210
Whatever this thing is,
it's arriving about...

16
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:46,460
...three, two, now.

17
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,530
Just tell me where he is.

18
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,060
- We found them.
- Go.

19
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,489
Is your mother home, young lady?
You take us to her.

20
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,480
Father said not to let strangers
in while he's away.

21
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:50,730
We're not strangers.
You're Sarah, aren't you?

22
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:55,170
We know about you.
You're the apple of your father's eye.

23
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:57,219
Would strangers know that?

24
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:01,810
So, lass, may two friends enter?

25
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,299
- Is that a yes, then?
- Yes.

26
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,739
Ah, lovely.

27
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,110
Such a good girl. Remind me
to give you a special treat.

28
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,650
They're trapped inside.

29
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,439
- Your mom make you that dress?
- What's all the fuss--?

30
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:32,520
- Evening to you, ma'am.
- Good evening.

31
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,069
Burn it down if you have to.

32
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,580
We can only stay a moment.
We have a message for your husband.

33
00:02:57,129 --> 00:02:58,780
You know my Daniel?

34
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,460
What is his message?

35
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,599
I'll give it to Sarah.

36
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,090
On my signal.

37
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:16,560
Close your eyes.
I have a surprise for you.

38
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:23,689
Tell your husband, Mr. Holtz....

39
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,360
Never mind, I'll tell him myself.

40
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,389
Where are they?

41
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,229
They're at my house.

42
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,300
Can't something be done
about that horrible noise?

43
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:18,750
- I think it wants its mother.
- Let's send it to her.

44
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,120
Do you want to do it,
or should I?

45
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:50,199
Are you going to do it...

46
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,379
...or am I?

47
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,620
I know it seems like
only a moment to you...

48
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,680
...but 227 years have passed
since our agreement.

49
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:16,449
Empires have risen and fallen.

50
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:19,079
Mankind has harnessed
the power of the sun...

51
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:23,069
...walked on the moon
and turned arid deserts green.

52
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:28,529
What of England? Has it survived
the years and destruction?

53
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,470
Yes.

54
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,509
It went through a rough patch 60 years
ago, but it's mostly unchanged.

55
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:42,720
Warm beer, boiled meat, bad teeth.
That's why I moved to L.A.

56
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:46,329
Have you followed this history?
American Revolution...

57
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,889
...Manifest Destiny, westward
expansion, the Beach Boys?

58
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:52,399
I understand enough.

59
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:58,879
One thing baffles me. These visions,
wars, the weapons of destruction.

60
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,660
How is it no one has killed
Angelus or Darla?

61
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:10,069
That's why I brought you here. Because
your fate and their fate are entwined.

62
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,399
Then let's go. Let's finish this.
I want Angelus.

63
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,439
I know. I want him too,
but we're going to do it right.

64
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:22,009
I haven't waited two and a half
centuries to mess it up.

65
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:24,519
You've been tracking him?

66
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:28,540
Yes, but not in the way
that you imagine.

67
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,740
There are other dimensions
where time behaves differently.

68
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,090
I have an ability to navigate
those dimensions.

69
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,409
- And is that why you haven't aged?
- Yes.

70
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,429
That, and I've had a little work done,
mostly around the eyes.

71
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,509
Now, get some rest.
You're going to need it.

72
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,600
- You figure out a way to do it?
- No.

73
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,759
I was thinking about the last time
you were here.

74
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,129
That. Kind of hard to forget.

75
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,289
I know. I've tried.

76
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,850
You came in here all,
"The world's a lonely place."

77
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,049
- I'd had a bad day.
- So you threw me through those doors...

78
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:17,789
...pushed me onto the bed
and took what you wanted?

79
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,350
Seemed like the thing to do
at the time.

80
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:25,279
Come in.

81
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,519
Sorry. We've had a breakthrough
with the scroll translations.

82
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:34,870
Some verbs Wes was using
were problematic...

83
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:38,929
...because of the Nyazian trick
of converting nouns and verbs...

84
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,019
...which he discovered by--

85
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:45,070
Sorry. I'll shut up so he can
tell you what he found.

86
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,700
The Tro-Clon isn't a person.
It's a confluence of events.

87
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:54,139
It not only involves you, Darla and the
child, but other things we don't know.

88
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,230
Doesn't it mean the kid
isn't this evil thing we feared?

89
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,549
Not necessarily. There are
a few Nyazian phrases...

90
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:05,009
...related to its birth
that I haven't completed.

91
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:08,889
- It's important you do.
- We need to know what's in the oven.

92
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,090
I know one thing about it.
Something's protecting it.

93
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:18,000
- How do you know that?
- Because I can't get rid of it.

94
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,269
Sorry I asked.

95
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:23,789
If I shot this in your stomach,
it wouldn't do anything?

96
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,570
- Fire away.
- No one's firing anything.

97
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,659
Angel's right. Something wants
this thing to come to term.

98
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:35,889
- After it's born, chop its head off.
- What if it doesn't have one?

99
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,350
- We'll need a big mallet.
- A net. Or a flamethrower.

100
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,809
Flamethrower?
There'll be no throwing of flames.

101
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,889
Not until we know what's going on.

102
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,960
If anybody has a problem with that,
they should leave now.

103
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:55,590
Not you.

104
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:03,139
Come on, guys. How about it?

105
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:10,379
- Cordy?
- You want me to protect...

106
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,980
...the vampire bitch who bit me
and her evil love child?

107
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:18,679
Okay, I'm in.

108
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,049
Ow!

109
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:23,049
You're a vampire. A punch in
the nose shouldn't hurt that much.

110
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:27,629
Not, "Ow, her nose."
She's having contractions.

111
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:01,279
- Morning, Ms. Morgan.
- Morning.

112
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:07,879
Could you take this to Pinderhook
in Demon Resources for me?

113
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:09,970
Sure.

114
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,779
Uh....

115
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:18,990
Ms. Morgan, I hate to bother you,
but I've admired you for a while and--

116
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:24,389
- I don't date guys from the mailroom.
- Me neither.

117
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:28,700
I just thought you should know
about this.

118
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,299
Wait.

119
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,659
You weasel. You think you can blackmail
your way onto me on my desk--

120
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:52,070
No. You got it all wrong.

121
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,629
I respect you way too much
to be attracted to you.

122
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:59,049
It's just, down in the mailroom,
I see a lot, you know?

123
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:02,409
Different factions in the firm.

124
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:06,289
There comes a time
when a guy has to choose a side.

125
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:12,350
And is that disk your way of telling
me you're choosing my side?

126
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,580
Who are we allied against,
you and I?

127
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,570
- Who is this common foe?
- I'd rather not--

128
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:23,860
If you don't tell me right now,
I am gonna have your skin peeled off...

129
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,399
...and stapled back on inside out.

130
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,029
Mr. Park.

131
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:31,419
Gavin.

132
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,000
Remember those exterminators
he sent to Angel's hotel?

133
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,490
They don't kill bugs,
they plant them.

134
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:43,250
Hm.

135
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,149
Good, That's it,
Where's your weight?

136
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,049
Balls of your feet?
Don't forget to follow,

137
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,320
Oh, God! You said....

138
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:05,809
"Ke-yi, ha, yawa, ow. "
Someone doing an incantation?

139
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,700
No. Angel started training Female 1
in martial arts.

140
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:13,299
- I think she got in a lucky punch.
- Hm.

141
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:17,679
- Any tech problems?
- Just a couple. Don't sweat it, though.

142
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:23,039
That is a transcription
of everything up to last week.

143
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:26,090
How about that?

144
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,379
I just asked myself, "If I were
a cockroach, where would I hide?"

145
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:34,720
And there you are! Did you really
think you could blackmail me?

146
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:38,080
Blackmail? No one cares.

147
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,029
Bumping uglies with an old man
who body-jumped into a vampire...

148
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:45,809
...is the closest you've been
to a relationship in years.

149
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:49,299
This is about something else.

150
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:51,210
Thank you, Cyril.

151
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:53,820
You're welcome, sir.

152
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,289
What was that crap
about choosing sides?

153
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,289
He did. He's on mine.

154
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:04,580
Is this your convoluted, pathetic way
of asking for my help?

155
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,590
Because you sure need it.
You're understaffed, underfunded...

156
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:14,289
...and clearly undertalented.
So, what have we learned here?

157
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,080
We? There is no we.

158
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,120
It was time you understood
the full scope...

159
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,399
...of what I've been doing
these past few months.

160
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,590
Who is this unidentified
pregnant female?

161
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,769
I don't know. We lost audio
for a couple of days last week.

162
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:37,830
- I can pull the tape.
- See? Need me.

163
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:53,460
- Darla?
- Impossible. Vampires can't give birth.

164
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,649
Tell me about it.

165
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:00,529
- Yeah?
- Linwood, it's Lilah.

166
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:04,049
You're not gonna believe
what I'm looking at.

167
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:09,419
How long since the last contraction?

168
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:13,259
About 20 minutes.
They're still real irregular.

169
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:16,940
- Something's wrong. The pain....
- You like pain.

170
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,820
This is different.
I want it out. Now!

171
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,169
That's what's happening.
The first stage of labor.

172
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:27,419
That's good, right?
How long does it last?

173
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:30,460
It varies.
The whole thing, maybe 18 hours.

174
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:34,860
Eighteen hours?
No, that's too long.

175
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:41,070
All right, okay.
Easy. Just lie down.

176
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,539
I'll be right back.

177
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:50,220
We gotta figure out what's inside
of her before it skitters out.

178
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:55,720
We should get a demony doctor who
knows how her vampire girl-parts work.

179
00:16:56,129 --> 00:16:59,360
- You know what I'm saying.
- Didn't she try that shaman thing?

180
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,490
Yeah, she did.

181
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:05,180
I don't suppose she ever went
to a normal doctor or a hospital?

182
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:10,579
There's an idea. A hospital.
Oh, wait. They don't admit vampires.

183
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,539
- Who says we have to admit?
- We don't need the right doctor.

184
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:16,380
We just need the right equipment.

185
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,589
I don't care. Just find somebody
who can answer the bloody question.

186
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:30,299
Heads will roll if the senior partners
hear of this.

187
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:32,670
They won't.
That's why we came to you.

188
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:35,950
Darla, pregnant. How'd we miss it?

189
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:39,549
I'm sequestering the psychics
in the conference room.

190
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,089
We'll get to the bottom of this.

191
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,849
A man works hard...

192
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,299
...builds something, waters it...

193
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,500
...grows rich and powerful...

194
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:56,490
...leaves his wife
for a younger beauty.

195
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:01,880
These are the reasons
we take certain blood oaths.

196
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:07,220
And to have it all vanish because....

197
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:13,319
I can't stress enough. There's
no way we could have foreseen this.

198
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,640
She's right, sir.
No one could have known.

199
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:28,859
Hi, you've reached the Tittles,

200
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:33,119
- For Christine, press one,
- For Bentley, press two,

201
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:37,180
Or to speak to or worship
Master Tarfall...

202
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:41,589
...Underlord of Pain, press three,

203
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:46,430
Master, it's happened. The thing
you have foreseen has come to be.

204
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:49,930
We must tell the others.

205
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,210
Another step, and it'll be your last.

206
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,619
If you haven't come for a fight,
you're in the wrong place.

207
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:38,900
A fight's exactly
what I'm looking for.

208
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,660
Then be a man and show your face.

209
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:48,470
I'm not a man.

210
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,779
What I mean is....

211
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,779
- You're not human.
- But masculine. You get that, right?

212
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,490
You'll get more than a fight
if you don't leave.

213
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,130
Fine. My mistake.

214
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,680
I thought you might want help
killing Angelus and Darla.

215
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:15,930
I don't need your help.
I'll kill them myself.

216
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:21,069
Not to rain on your parade,
but, no, you won't.

217
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:24,890
You'll die a bitter man
and never see them again.

218
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:27,440
- You don't know that.
- I kind of do.

219
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,609
It'll be over 200 years...

220
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:35,019
...before you get another chance
to confront Angelus or Darla.

221
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,670
Is this where the demon offers the
broken man a chance to change that?

222
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,799
I'll take you to them,
two centuries into the future.

223
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,710
- Through black magic and sorcery.
- No, on a mule cart.

224
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:52,170
Of course through black magic
and sorcery. I'm a demon.

225
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,710
- What do you want from me?
- Your word.

226
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:01,339
I want your word that when the time
comes, you will show them no mercy.

227
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,700
I don't mean to be pushy,
but this is a limited time offer.

228
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,369
Say yes, and I'll take you
to them this very hour.

229
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:23,789
Say no, and realize the one chance
to avenge your wife and children...

230
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,930
...has slipped away forever.

231
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:37,990
How you feeling?

232
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:43,619
I haven't had blood in a day, and your
spawn is trying to rip its way out.

233
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:47,450
Paging Dr. Angel.

234
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:55,309
I sent Gunn for an ultrasound
machine so we can look inside Darla.

235
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,880
- Is this a classroom?
- It's a teaching hospital.

236
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,900
How are you feeling, Darla?

237
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,170
Something wrong?

238
00:22:05,849 --> 00:22:10,200
- I think the contractions have stopped.
- Is that bad?

239
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,910
- Do you mind if I--?
- I won't bite.

240
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,539
No, but that thing inside might.

241
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:29,650
It may have been Braxton-Hicks
contractions. A form of false labor.

242
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,640
- False?
- As in, not ready to come out yet.

243
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:38,160
I'm way past ready.
I'd cut it out if I could.

244
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,839
- Here you go. One ultrasound machine.
- Darla, up on the table.

245
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:47,339
Don't you wanna see what's inside?

246
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,849
You've kept me here long enough.
Where are they?

247
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,549
- It's not that simple.
- I'm tired of waiting!

248
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:14,160
Like I said, it's not that simple.

249
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,680
You think I'd transport you
two and a half centuries...

250
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:23,089
...if I could walk up to Angelus
and stake him myself? Please.

251
00:23:23,849 --> 00:23:28,200
There are rules and forces at work
far greater than either of us.

252
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:36,180
Boy, you vengeful types aren't
real good at playing with others.

253
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,049
It's my street face.

254
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,319
Now, put that on.
I've lined up some men to help us.

255
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:58,259
Are you now
or have you ever been a vampire?

256
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,049
Are any of your friends vampires?

257
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,240
Seven of Cups.

258
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:06,180
Queen of Swords.

259
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:08,579
Jack of Wands.

260
00:24:09,329 --> 00:24:12,559
Thank you for coming.
And correct me if I'm wrong...

261
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,160
...but the role of a psychic
is to be psychic.

262
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,130
To predict the future...

263
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:22,829
...so Wolfram and Hart isn't
in this kind of predicament.

264
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,900
I can't apologize enough, sir.

265
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:28,869
You're right, you can't.

266
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:32,190
I'm not without compassion.

267
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:37,119
I'll give you a chance to save
your job and your skin.

268
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:45,059
No, you're not.
You're gonna have me killed.

269
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:49,549
Why couldn't you have had
such foresight when we needed it?

270
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:55,089
We are telling the truth.

271
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:57,210
Thank you.

272
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,619
Intelligence is coming in.
No one knows how Darla got pregnant.

273
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,569
There's a prophecy
involving a vampire birth...

274
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,329
... but the scroll it' s recorded on
is missing.

275
00:25:09,329 --> 00:25:12,170
Do you have any idea
how many groups and cults...

276
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:14,859
...would kill to get their hands
on this baby?

277
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:18,349
- We gotta get it before anybody knows.
- And we will.

278
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:24,099
We need to get it, dissect it
and find out what it means.

279
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,160
Berlin on the phone.

280
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,839
If they've heard about this in Berlin,
Muncie can't be far behind.

281
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,759
If the senior partners are looking
to assign blame...

282
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,829
...the buck stops here,
you understand me?

283
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:39,930
Not exactly, sir.

284
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:44,880
If the partners are looking to place
blame, I'll have to step forward.

285
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,259
That's inspiring, sir.

286
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:51,240
Yes. I'll step forward and blame you.

287
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:57,160
Darla was resurrected on your watch.
I can think of no better scapegoat.

288
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,960
You think this is over?
Watch and learn, rookie.

289
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,259
Yes?

290
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,700
I understand.

291
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,049
Well, then, let's take a look,
shall we?

292
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,140
I haven't studied
one of these for a while.

293
00:27:20,329 --> 00:27:23,380
- Isn't that a head?
- I think it is.

294
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:27,339
- Or is that the head?
- Maybe you're both right.

295
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:33,549
It's not like I'm suggesting
it's an evil two-headed thing.

296
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,230
I see it.

297
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:40,930
My little parasite.

298
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:45,299
- Oh, my....
- What is it?

299
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,380
- It's human.
- Human, as in humanoid?

300
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:51,089
As in cannibalistic,
underground dwellers?

301
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:52,829
No.

302
00:27:53,329 --> 00:27:56,140
Human as in.... A boy.

303
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,369
- A boy?
- A boy.

304
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:04,150
A boy. You're carrying a boy.

305
00:28:05,329 --> 00:28:06,490
Great.

306
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:11,980
I'm gonna have a son.
I'm gonna have a son.

307
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:17,480
Guys, as fascinating as an ultrasound
image may appear, you should--

308
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:21,019
Me, a father...

309
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:24,130
...to a son.
Do you know what that means?

310
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:27,829
- We're surrounded by vampires?
- No, it's a human boy--

311
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:36,259
We are surrounded by vampires.

312
00:28:38,329 --> 00:28:43,250
- So who has a plan?
- "Don't let them kill us" sounds good.

313
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:46,859
Behold the Miracle Child.

314
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:49,119
The Miracle Child.

315
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:53,099
- For his time has come.
- The Miracle Child.

316
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,750
The Miracle Child.

317
00:28:56,329 --> 00:28:59,069
Praise be. Praise be.

318
00:28:59,329 --> 00:29:00,660
Praise be.

319
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:14,509
The buildings are taller,
the machines more powerful.

320
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:19,559
And you can get really great
Thai food at 2 in the morning.

321
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,269
People today are the same
as they were in your day.

322
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:27,329
They drink, they fight,
they work hard, they fall in love.

323
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:32,049
- They have families.
- Yes, they still have families.

324
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:37,029
I hope these men you've hired
are ruthless bastards.

325
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:45,039
- Go away!
- It's Sahjhan.

326
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:48,930
This is where we'll get your men.

327
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:53,380
Very exclusive.

328
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:04,990
These aren't men.

329
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:09,849
Once again, gender, not species.
I should have said minions.

330
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:15,289
Have you seen Grappler demons fight?

331
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:21,069
Not the sharpest pencils in the box
but merciless in battle.

332
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:26,259
Okay, guys, over here.
Time to meet the new jefe,

333
00:30:26,849 --> 00:30:29,759
And, Flarmar, leave the head
in the ring, okay?

334
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:34,809
- Ready to command your troops?
- Any other surprises I should know?

335
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:40,839
I'm all for being worshipped,
but what the hell is going on?

336
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:43,990
- What do you want?
- To protect the Miracle Child.

337
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,619
That's good.
We're here for the same thing.

338
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,789
Die!

339
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:07,799
As it has been prophesied
by our great potentate, Ul-Thar...

340
00:31:08,849 --> 00:31:12,109
...we vow our lives
to protect this special child.

341
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:15,299
Hear that? Our kid, special.

342
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:19,240
Let's kill the humans and use
their blood to nourish the mother...

343
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,670
- ...and her Miracle Child.
- Miracle Child.

344
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,059
Guess I'm getting dinner after all.

345
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,019
This should provide your ops
unit with a tactical base.

346
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:37,009
Plan and elevation drawings
of every floor in Angel's hotel.

347
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:41,660
I have surveillance capabilities
to monitor the engagement from here.

348
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:45,900
Excellent. I'm confident
my men will capture the target.

349
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:50,940
The larger question revolves around
the extraction of the target's cargo.

350
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:54,619
- Getting the baby from Darla.
- Of course.

351
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,750
- For that we've called in an expert.
- You flatter me, sir.

352
00:31:59,329 --> 00:32:04,279
May I introduce Dr. Fetvanovich
from our office in the Balkans?

353
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:07,400
- How do you do?
- He is a specialist...

354
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:12,299
...in paranormal obstetrics. We are
very fortunate he's consented to help.

355
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:17,700
It is I who feel fortunate.
A vampire birth is...

356
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,269
...unprecedented.

357
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:26,799
I look forward to dissecting
both the mother and the child.

358
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,609
You might wanna join the fight.

359
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:35,279
Sorry. I'm gonna have to be
Switzerland and sit this one out.

360
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:39,619
You said you were just gonna
kill the humans, right?

361
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,480
Yes, just the humans.

362
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,450
We will nourish you,
slice you open...

363
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,319
...wear your entrails as a belt
and eat your eyeballs...

364
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,450
...before we worship
the Miracle Child.

365
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,549
- Miracle Child.
- Okay, I'm in.

366
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,220
Gunn, we'll hold them off.
The rest of you, get Darla to the car.

367
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:01,990
I'd rather fight.
Show these youngsters real carnage.

368
00:33:02,329 --> 00:33:04,289
That's thoughtful, but go.

369
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,049
Charles, do you have
an extra dagger?

370
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,450
- This okay?
- Perfect.

371
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,019
On my count of three. One, two--

372
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:16,150
You make one move, and I'll slice
the Miracle Kid into triplets.

373
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,619
It's always the quiet ones.

374
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,460
Wait!

375
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:23,529
They don't know
the knife can't hurt the baby.

376
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:28,180
They do now.
Vampires have great hearing.

377
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,059
Here we go.

378
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,460
Everybody out!

379
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,900
All clear.

380
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:23,250
We're clear, Alpha, move in,

381
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,349
Let's go, men.

382
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,739
Upstairs. Go!

383
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,599
Alpha Team, move out.

384
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,039
Delta Team, behind me.

385
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:37,329
Lobby secured, sir.

386
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:41,599
Let's set up out here.

387
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:43,929
Oh, and get a hose.

388
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:47,280
I'm afraid there might be some blood.

389
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:51,969
And you can set the baby's cage
next to Mama's.

390
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,989
- I think we lost them.
- Anybody hurt?

391
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,639
Nothing Band-Aids
and ice cream can't fix.

392
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,710
- I'm good.
- Darla? Darla, everything okay?

393
00:35:09,849 --> 00:35:11,110
Yeah, fine.

394
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,090
- You all right?
- It's nothing.

395
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:18,519
It's the kid, isn't it?

396
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:21,340
Seeing him on the monitor?

397
00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:26,239
No, I'm just disappointed
the vamp cult didn't kill all of you.

398
00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:32,099
So where are we going? I'm famished,
and we know how ugly that can get.

399
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,650
- Where are we going?
- Somewhere safe.

400
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,150
Where's safe? Hotel's definitely out.

401
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,840
- How about--?
- Vegas? Sorry.

402
00:35:39,849 --> 00:35:42,199
Too high-profile.
But we need to get out.

403
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,380
- Actually--
- I hate it when you say that.

404
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:48,239
"Actually" means
your oversized brain...

405
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:51,900
...thought of something
we failed to consider, right?

406
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:56,170
Just other people know more about
this kid's importance than we do.

407
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,159
The only thing that can help us
is at the hotel.

408
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:03,940
We can't protect your child
unless we get the scrolls.

409
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:08,280
Okay then, quick stop.

410
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,670
- Is this man with you?
- Where's Angelus?

411
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:09,440
Who is this pirate with the sword,
and what is he doing there?

412
00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:14,590
I don't know, sir. But he called
Angel by his old name, Angelus.

413
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,090
- I need better audio.
- Any second.

414
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:20,320
- Hand over the vampires,
- He's covered, sir,

415
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,679
This has gone on long enough.

416
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:27,159
I don't care who that man is,
take him out. Take him out now.

417
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:30,480
- Over.
- Take him out!

418
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,369
This should be sweet.

419
00:37:37,449 --> 00:37:39,769
- Picture!
- I'm working on it, sir.

420
00:37:40,449 --> 00:37:43,469
Stop it! Gentlemen, please!

421
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:47,280
- Burke's never lost.
- It'll be over in just a second.

422
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,579
That should do it.

423
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,900
Anybody there?

424
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,139
Over?

425
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:13,820
- Why are you stopping here?
- It's a few blocks. I'll go on foot.

426
00:38:14,409 --> 00:38:18,099
- Who says you get to be wheelman?
- Who says it has to be a man?

427
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,260
- The scrolls?
- In the office.

428
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,889
If I'm not back in five,
leave without me.

429
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:28,690
- Leave to where?
- Anywhere. Somewhere safe.

430
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:31,019
Angel?

431
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,650
Yeah?

432
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,610
Just get out of here.

433
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,099
Angelus.

434
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,769
I've been looking for you.

435
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:45,030
- He said five.
- It's been six and a half.

436
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:49,440
- So typical of him.
- Wouldn't hurt to wait another minute.

437
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:52,059
What's the worst thing that
could happen in another minute?

438
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,780
Ask a stupid question....

439
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:01,329
Her water's broken. This is for real.

440
00:40:02,409 --> 00:40:04,579
Should be a blanket in the trunk.

441
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:09,940
Are we gonna deliver the kid here?
Shouldn't we go somewhere?

442
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:12,909
What's keeping Angel?
