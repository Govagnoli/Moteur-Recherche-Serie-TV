1
00:00:01,194 --> 00:00:04,220
<i>[ Man ]</i>
<i>Previously on</i> Angel.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,232
- [ Gasps ]
-  You are my sunshine, my only sunshine

3
00:00:08,334 --> 00:00:10,734
You make me happy

4
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,400
<i>[ Wesley ] She's being hollowed out so this</i>
<i>thing can claw its way back into the world.</i>

5
00:00:16,509 --> 00:00:18,977
- Let's save the day.
<i>-[ Wesley ] It's called Illyria--</i>

6
00:00:19,078 --> 00:00:21,876
<i>a great monarch and warrior</i>
<i>of the Demon Age.</i>

7
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,541
[ Gasps ]
Why can't I stay?

8
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,114
[ Groans ]

9
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,130
This will do.

10
00:00:39,232 --> 00:00:41,996
Fred?

11
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,678
Illyria?

12
00:01:00,786 --> 00:01:02,754
My name.

13
00:01:04,223 --> 00:01:06,623
You would presume to speak my name?

14
00:01:06,726 --> 00:01:11,993
<i>Because I am returned in the body of a human,</i>
<i>you think you can speak to me.</i>

15
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:14,692
- It's disgusting.
- Who is Winifred Burkle?

16
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:21,172
I thought the humans would
have long died out by now.

17
00:01:21,274 --> 00:01:25,005
Instead you've grown bold.

18
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:28,603
- So you don't know who Fred is?
- Nor care.

19
00:01:29,949 --> 00:01:32,509
Bleat at me no longer.
We're done.

20
00:01:32,618 --> 00:01:34,813
Yes.

21
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:36,821
We are.

22
00:02:34,046 --> 00:02:36,276
Oh.

23
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:38,350
Now I remember.

24
00:02:40,686 --> 00:02:43,655
Winifred Burkle is the shell I'm in.

25
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:48,416
She's the woman you killed.

26
00:02:50,062 --> 00:02:52,030
This is grief.

27
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,226
I'm watching human grief.
It's like offal in my mouth.

28
00:02:59,905 --> 00:03:04,706
If you stay here, you'll taste it
every day, every second.

29
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,143
Look. Humans rule the Earth.

30
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:12,217
<i>They will last for millennia...</i>

31
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,810
<i>like roaches crawling everywhere...</i>

32
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:17,889
crying and sweating...

33
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,458
and puking their feelings all over you.

34
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:24,061
Go back.

35
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:26,859
Sleep until the humans are gone.

36
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:31,360
They are stupid and weak.

37
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,438
They'll kill each other off...

38
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:36,565
and you can return
to the world you deserve.

39
00:03:38,144 --> 00:03:40,612
Leave this shell.

40
00:03:40,713 --> 00:03:43,443
You seek to save
what's rotted through.

41
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,652
This carcass is bound to me.

42
00:03:47,753 --> 00:03:50,654
I could not change that if I cared to.

43
00:03:50,756 --> 00:03:53,987
But you have opened my eyes to truth.

44
00:03:54,093 --> 00:03:57,426
If the world is truly overrun
by humans...

45
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:02,660
then I have work to do.

46
00:04:12,578 --> 00:04:15,479
Can't even get drunk.

47
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:18,778
Why would anyone ever make
a bottle this small?

48
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,784
It's inhuman.

49
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:27,485
Thousands would have died
if we'd saved her.

50
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:31,161
Yeah.

51
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:35,062
She wouldn't have wanted that.

52
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:37,795
[ Sighs ]
Yeah.

53
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,565
I tried calling Wes.

54
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:45,644
There's no answer.

55
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:50,415
Guess she's gone then.

56
00:04:52,184 --> 00:04:54,618
It's like a bloody tease.

57
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,712
It's, like, here's what
a bottle ofJack would look like...

58
00:04:57,823 --> 00:04:59,791
if you actually had one.

59
00:04:59,892 --> 00:05:03,350
Or here's a drink,
but it's very far away.

60
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:07,023
<i>What does that mean, really?</i>

61
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:09,727
It's a play on perspective.

62
00:05:09,835 --> 00:05:12,827
Gone. Wh-What does it mean,
that she's gone?

63
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:16,339
Well, in the world of men,
a person dies, they stay that way.

64
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:19,707
- Unless you're a vampire.
- Or the ghost of one that saved the world.

65
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:22,576
Or Buffy.

66
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:26,014
Death doesn't have to be the end,
not in our world.

67
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,484
Rules can be broken.

68
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:32,921
All you have to do
is push hard enough.

69
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:38,527
<i>- Gonna torture him?</i>
- Thinkin' about it.

70
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:41,099
Can I help?
I'm really good at it.

71
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,498
Thanks,
but this is kind of personal.

72
00:05:43,602 --> 00:05:47,402
Why do you think I wanna help?
Because I've got some kind of blood lust?

73
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:50,771
Well, okay, that too,
but Fred's my friend.

74
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:54,107
We went out for drinks
all the-- once.

75
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:57,011
And if Poindexter here had anything to do
with hurting her...

76
00:05:57,116 --> 00:05:59,607
then I'm in for a big,
fat pound of flesh!

77
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:01,618
Angel?

78
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,984
He's on his way back. How's Fred?

79
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:07,547
- You tied Knox up.
- We're gonna torture him.

80
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,787
Good. Why?

81
00:06:09,895 --> 00:06:14,161
He knows what's happening. Been hiding it the
whole time. I just need a few minutes alone.

82
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:16,962
- He's involved in this?
- Pretty sure.

83
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:19,765
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Yeah, buddy. Why didn't you?

84
00:06:19,872 --> 00:06:21,840
- Shut up!
- I thought we wanted him to talk.

85
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:25,104
- Whatever he knows--
- Doesn't matter anymore. Fred's gone.

86
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:30,948
<i>[ Knox Chortling ]</i>

87
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:35,579
I'm sorry. It's just, um--

88
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:37,952
It's not what you think.

89
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:40,651
It's-- It's beautiful.

90
00:06:42,461 --> 00:06:44,486
Tell them.
Tell them what happened.

91
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,831
The infection--

92
00:06:49,935 --> 00:06:52,836
Illyria consumed her...

93
00:06:52,938 --> 00:06:54,838
took over her body.

94
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:01,206
Then it's still Fred, right?
This thing is just controlling--

95
00:07:01,313 --> 00:07:03,281
She's... gone.

96
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:06,180
- You don't know that.
<i>- Wait. I'm confused.</i>

97
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:08,617
It looks like Fred, but it's not?

98
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:12,122
<i>She's so much more than that now.</i>
<i>Beyond flesh.</i>

99
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:14,283
<i>Beyond perfection.</i>

100
00:07:15,628 --> 00:07:18,461
I loved Fred. I really did.

101
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:22,523
<i>She had a warmth</i>
<i>that took you in and held you...</i>

102
00:07:22,635 --> 00:07:26,662
<i>until everything cold and distant</i>
<i>melted away.</i>

103
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,042
<i>She was the most beautiful,</i>
<i>perfect woman...</i>

104
00:07:31,143 --> 00:07:33,043
<i>I ever met.</i>

105
00:07:34,947 --> 00:07:37,541
That's why I chose her.

106
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,084
She's the only one that was worthy.

107
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:43,421
Wes, don't.

108
00:07:43,522 --> 00:07:46,650
- We need him. I know how you feel.
- You know--

109
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,158
You didn't feel her die.

110
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:55,894
She was shaking with pain
and terrified and so brave.

111
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:59,495
She was better
than anyone I've known.

112
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:01,505
Better than--

113
00:08:06,378 --> 00:08:08,278
She's gone.

114
00:08:11,717 --> 00:08:13,708
<i>I know.</i>

115
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:15,753
Now let's get her back.

116
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:18,482
- So that's it? England was a bust?
- Not entirely.

117
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,582
We found out where the sarcophagus came from.
There were thousands of'em.

118
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:24,527
- Minus one.
- What about this Drogyn character?
He wouldn't help?

119
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,530
He couldn't.
We were too late.

120
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:29,396
I should have seen it.

121
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:30,836
<i>Knox. He sang for me,</i>
<i>and I should have seen this.</i>

122
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:32,428
<i>Knox. He sang for me,</i>
<i>and I should have seen this.</i>

123
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:37,373
- It's not your fault.
- If I'd concentrated harder,
read him better, maybe Fred--

124
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,444
There's a lot we might have done...

125
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:42,070
starting with never coming
to Wolfram and Hart in the first place.

126
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:44,706
We can beat ourselves up over it later,
but right now--

127
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:49,720
<i>I'm sorry, Angelcakes.</i>
<i>I-- I got nothin´</i>

128
00:08:51,023 --> 00:08:52,923
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:55,926
- [ Sighs ] Lorne!
- No, let him go.

130
00:08:56,028 --> 00:08:58,428
If he's doubting himself,
he won't be any good to us.

131
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,966
Lorne's right.
We should have seen this coming.

132
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:06,026
Wouldn't have made a difference. Drogyn said
the sarcophagus was preordained to be released.

133
00:09:06,138 --> 00:09:09,005
Nothing could have
stopped it from arriving.

134
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:11,736
That's not completely true.

135
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:15,336
I played a round of piñata with lab boy
while you were gone.

136
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:17,915
<i>The sarcophagus</i>
<i>was stuck in Customs...</i>

137
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:22,009
and it should have stayed there,
but someone got it out.

138
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:23,850
Who?

139
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:31,184
- I'm working on it.
- Oh. You're working on it.

140
00:09:31,296 --> 00:09:33,457
Good for you, Charles.
Not a moment to lose.

141
00:09:33,565 --> 00:09:36,295
<i>[ Angel ] Wes. I know you're hurting.</i>
<i>Keep your footing.</i>

142
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:39,769
I need you sharp,
all of you, for Fred's sake.

143
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:42,306
- There is no Fred anymore.
- You don't know that.

144
00:09:42,408 --> 00:09:44,933
I watched it gut her
from the inside out.

145
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:49,343
<i>Everything she was is gone.</i>
<i>There is nothing left but a shell.</i>

146
00:09:49,448 --> 00:09:51,439
Then we'll figure out a way
to fill it back up.

147
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,814
The thing only took over her body.
Just the tip of the theological.

148
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,648
It's the soul that matters.

149
00:09:55,754 --> 00:09:57,881
Trust us.
We're kind of experts.

150
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,118
What about her--
if her organs have been liquefied?

151
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,888
Flash fried in a pillar of fire,
saving the world.

152
00:10:03,996 --> 00:10:05,930
I got better.

153
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:08,397
You really believe there's a chance
of bringing her back?

154
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,866
Fred's soul is out there somewhere.

155
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:14,234
<i>We'll find it and we'll put it back</i>
<i>where it belongs.</i>

156
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,901
We'll make every son of a bitch who had
a hand in this pay. We all on the same page?

157
00:10:20,512 --> 00:10:22,139
- Where do we start?
- We need the big guns.

158
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,545
- Willow.
- Won't be the first time she rattled the dead.

159
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,550
Last time I heard,
she was in South America.

160
00:10:26,652 --> 00:10:29,450
We'll track her down
and get her here as soon as we can.

161
00:10:29,555 --> 00:10:32,319
In the meantime,
we need to contain Illyria.

162
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:36,224
<i>Wes,you're the only one who had contact.</i>
<i>Any idea where she's headed?</i>

163
00:10:36,328 --> 00:10:40,355
Hey! Come back here, you little--

164
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:42,434
Oh, my God.

165
00:10:42,534 --> 00:10:45,162
<i>Fred?</i>

166
00:10:50,242 --> 00:10:54,440
I knew you'd come for me.
My life is yours.

167
00:10:56,415 --> 00:10:58,383
I-- I worship you.

168
00:10:58,484 --> 00:11:01,681
Yes, I know. Worship.

169
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:10,592
I've been waiting so long for this.
