1
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:07,269
Only two left. I'll cut you
a deal. They're collector's items.

2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,189
You won't be sorry.

3
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:15,189
Turn them on and let them go.

4
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:17,170
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

5
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:23,550
- Here you go.
- Nice doing business with you.

6
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:25,000
Wait, miss!

7
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:32,409
Okay.

8
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:05,659
Demons with one eye, demons with
12 eyes, some with double vision.

9
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:08,599
No blind demons.

10
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:14,550
- Perhaps Angel's found a new species.
- What? Helen Kellerus Homicidalus?

11
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:22,150
- It's possible she's not a demon.
- You think?

12
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:26,210
Maybe she's learned to hone
her senses around her disability.

13
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,840
Angel said it was like
she anticipated his actions.

14
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,180
A handy skill,
in a fight or on a date.

15
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,020
Unusual to be certain,
but not necessarily demonic.

16
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,639
Someone like that stands out in
a crowd. For an assassin, I mean.

17
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,430
- Decidedly.
- Maybe even have a record.

18
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,949
One assumes she's done
this sort of thing before.

19
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,949
- Vanessa Brewer.
- What? You found her?

20
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,599
It doesn't always have to be weird.

21
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,560
Sometimes real human people
can be just awful.

22
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,860
- First arrested in '93.
- She fled the scene of a homicide.

23
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:03,300
No charges. Arrested again in '95.

24
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:07,819
Charged with aggravated assault.
That one never went to trial.

25
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,909
And finally arrested in '99
as a suspect in a double homicide...

26
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,779
- ...for which she's now on trial.
- She was on bail when Angel met her.

27
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,230
But that's not the real whammy.
Look who's defending her.

28
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:26,699
We request the court's compassion
in this obviously mishandled affair.

29
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:29,670
The D.A.'s attempt
to link Miss Brewer...

30
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:33,089
...to this brutal crime
is almost laughable.

31
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:36,480
To think that my client,
with her particular disability...

32
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:39,550
...could physically
commit such a murder...

33
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:41,879
...is beyond the realm of belief.

34
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:43,399
Hey, hold it!

35
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:56,139
She obviously doesn't see
the way we do, but she can see.

36
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:01,399
In a sense. The eye's only capable...

37
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:06,019
...of registering a small portion
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

38
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:09,550
But if she were equipped
to see outside that range--

39
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:13,079
She'd be Superman.
What's the diff in how she sees?

40
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,029
She'll look at cell bars.
Why are we still talking about this?

41
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:20,350
Because Wolfram and Hart's
representing her pro bono...

42
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,410
...which means she's probably
still working for them.

43
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,579
I can't believe
you got her off on all charges.

44
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,480
Not since Ostrosky vs. California...

45
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,439
...have I seen such
devious legal maneuvering.

46
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,360
And now the big brass
are smiling upon you.

47
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,600
You're the man of the hour.

48
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,360
Is there something you want?

49
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:02,779
Is it me, or is there something
kind of hot about her?

50
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,240
I'm just saying, I wouldn't say no.
I'd be too scared to.

51
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,459
- Lindsey, come say hello.
- I think she likes you.

52
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,509
You remember Lindsey McDonald,
our point man on Miss Brewer's case?

53
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:31,519
Did an excellent job.

54
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,949
- Thank you, Lindsey.
- You're welcome.

55
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,220
- It's nice to see you again.
- You too.

56
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:44,439
Bye. Got a sec?

57
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,470
Does she unnerve you?

58
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,660
A little.

59
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,290
Two minutes with her,
I feel like my spine's been fused.

60
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:10,579
Still, one has to admire her talent
and her work ethic.

61
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:21,589
- You okay? You look stressed.
- I've been putting in the hours--

62
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:25,759
Well, that's a big part,
the perspiration.

63
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:29,259
But the other part, the inspiration...

64
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,689
...you've had a rough year
on that end.

65
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,949
- I've made some bad choices.
- Well, I'll say.

66
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,639
- Sending the rogue slayer after Angel?
- Among other things.

67
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,730
But you had success in court.
You're pulling out of it.

68
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,439
I'm fond of you.
I'd like to see you move up.

69
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:57,029
- I'm glad to hear that, sir.
- Not everybody will.

70
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,939
This is kind of
our harvest time of year...

71
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,360
...where we separate the winners
from the dead weight.

72
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:10,050
I have to say,
you don't seem that happy lately.

73
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,480
Could I take a wild stab
as to what it might be?

74
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,350
Sure.

75
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:18,810
It's your age. You're a young man.

76
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:22,300
You've hitched your wagon
to our bright star.

77
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,709
But now you're starting to feel,
"Is that all there is?"

78
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:33,379
- Sometimes you question things but--
- I did crazy things when I was young.

79
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,399
Searching and all.

80
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:39,379
Took me a while to realize how
the world was and where I belonged.

81
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:43,200
Actually, the world isn't
that complicated.

82
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,299
It's made for those
who know how to use it.

83
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:49,649
- Yes, sir.
- Don't give me that "Yes, sir" crap.

84
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:53,080
I want you to think
about these things.

85
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,620
You won't be happy till you find
your place in the world.

86
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:02,889
Enough of the old guy's lecture.
Down to business.

87
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,610
I doubt she had a happy childhood.

88
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,529
- Sir?
- Our blind friend, Vanessa.

89
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:14,669
She was terribly abused, the details
of which are tragic and shocking.

90
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,139
You should create them.
Sooner, rather than later.

91
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,259
She'll do something
that requires a strong defense.

92
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:27,090
Strong defense, alibis, creative
alternatives to incarceration.

93
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,139
She's an invaluable tool to some
of our most important clients.

94
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:33,669
What will she do?

95
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:38,110
There's some children arriving.
They pose a threat.

96
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:42,740
Some children?

97
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:45,740
Is this too shocking for you?

98
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:48,909
I'm thinking it might be, for a jury.

99
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:53,070
Which is why I'm thinking her
terrible childhood drove her to it.

100
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:58,330
Not guilty by reason of insanity.
But she probably won't be caught.

101
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:04,409
Who are these children?

102
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:07,129
It's best we know
only what we need to...

103
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:12,379
...without forgetting the important
part we play in the whole.

104
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,000
You'll want to get right on it.

105
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,450
- They acquitted her. Hung jury.
- I'm sorry, Angel.

106
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:34,840
How can I fight evil
if they won't put it away?

107
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,139
- It's not your fault.
- No, it's not my fault.

108
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,759
I didn't cause it, and I can't fix it.
I can't do anything about it.

109
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,639
Well, she's guilty.
She's guilty and they let her go.

110
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,200
I saw her murder a man, and I can't
even testify to that in court.

111
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:59,049
- Maybe in night court--
- It's their court, not mine.

112
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:01,629
- Whose?
- Their rules, their game.

113
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:06,490
- You mean the Wolfram-and-Hart types.
- I have no place in their world.

114
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,029
- Angel--!
- How can I fight if I can't get in?

115
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,889
You have a place.
We'll fight elsewhere.

116
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,539
It's still their world, Wesley.
Structured for power, not truth.

117
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,129
It's their system,
and it's one that works.

118
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:25,909
It works because there's no guilt...

119
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:28,980
...there's no torment,
no consequences.

120
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:31,980
It's pure.

121
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:37,629
I remember what that was like.

122
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,070
Sometimes I miss that clarity.

123
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:48,029
But not the "trying to kill
your friends and family" part, right?

124
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:49,980
Just checking.

125
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,980
Nothing ever changes.

126
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,629
I need your help.

127
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,230
What do you mean?

128
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,159
I want out.

129
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:21,379
You probably think this is a trick.

130
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:29,850
Are you afraid of me, Lindsey?

131
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:32,490
You think maybe I might kill you?

132
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,200
No.

133
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:38,779
I'm smelling a whole lot of fear.

134
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:42,259
Big, stinky, mortal terror.

135
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,289
So, no.

136
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:49,529
I don't think this is a trick.
I think it's a big joke.

137
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,220
I don't like this any more than you.

138
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,690
- I don't have a choice.
- Yes, you do.

139
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:58,429
You sold your soul for
a nice office and a company car.

140
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:03,019
You think you got me all figured out?
You know everything about me?

141
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:07,179
- Everything I need to know.
- Your father was a merchant, right?

142
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:12,149
Linen and silk? Did pretty well?
Had servants until you killed them?

143
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,779
Just the one.

144
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:17,600
Well, our files aren't
a hundred percent.

145
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:22,080
But I guess it's fair to say
you've never seen real poverty.

146
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,429
I'm talking dirt poor,
no shoes, no toilet...

147
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,639
...six kids in a room.
After flu season, we were four.

148
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,350
I was 7 when they took the house.
Came right in and took it.

149
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:37,110
And my daddy's being nice,
joking while he signs the deed.

150
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,000
My choice was to be stepped on
or get stepping...

151
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,789
...and I swore I'd never be the guy
with the stupid grin on my face...

152
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,779
- ...while my life got dribbled out.
- Sorry, I nodded off.

153
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,980
Get to the part where you're evil.

154
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:58,710
I found out about a job.
The blind woman. Vanessa Brewer.

155
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,679
- That you got off.
- There's a new contract.

156
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,309
- Save the lawyer talk--
- She's gonna kill some kids.

157
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,210
I've worked pretty hairy deals.
Comes with the turf. But this....

158
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:13,049
What do you know?

159
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:16,990
Almost nothing. Some kids
from overseas, job's in a few days.

160
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:19,259
I need more.

161
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,539
There's some files.
They'd be in the firm vault.

162
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,980
- Get them.
- I can't go back.

163
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:28,539
- You understand what that place is?
- I don't sense resolve--

164
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,769
They constantly watch you.
Other companies have drug testing...

165
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:36,059
...they have mind readers.
They'd kill me.

166
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:39,269
That's an acceptable risk.
You're panicking.

167
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,759
You can't believe
how bad you let things get.

168
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:47,210
That's not change.

169
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:52,110
You gotta make a decision to change.
That's something you do by yourself.

170
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:56,320
Most people? They never do.

171
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,789
I get myself killed,
that'll convince you I've changed?

172
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,850
It's a start.

173
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,470
Vault's at sublevel 2,
opposite the boiler room.

174
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,080
- Sewer access?
- Burn your way in.

175
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,190
Why are you going?
I thought he was doing it.

176
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,980
- Two-man job. And the vault?
- My pass.

177
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:18,590
I need it to get in
because of tight security...

178
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:21,409
...but I can leave it
downstairs for you.

179
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,289
- Again, I say--
- It's guarded. Demon.

180
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,799
Doesn't like unauthorized visits.

181
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:30,450
- What kind of demon?
- Pregothian, I think.

182
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:33,620
- I'll get you a profile, weaknesses.
- Right.

183
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:39,299
I'll do my best with security. You
gotta move fast because-- Damn it!

184
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:42,230
- What?
- The threshold has shamans.

185
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:45,200
They can sense a vampire
crossing the threshold.

186
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:48,340
- Won't be a problem.
- Seems pretty simple...

187
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:50,669
...except for the
"you'll get caught" factor.

188
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,610
"The righteous shall walk
a thorny path."

189
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:01,639
Yeah, I can get ahold of one.
But why would I want to?

190
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,330
For justice and doing the right thing?

191
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,399
Not interested in some
rich guy's heartbreak.

192
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,090
You're low.

193
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,909
Just my opinion.

194
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:29,840
- Give me one good reason.
- It'll be very dangerous.

195
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:32,139
Okay.

196
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:14,569
Entering sublevel 3,
Priority clearance required,

197
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25,910
Lilah.

198
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,339
- You scared me.
- Me too.

199
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,720
I'm sorry. I'm always
in too much of a hurry.

200
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:34,490
I think we all are.

201
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,410
- Oh, yeah. Doing some research?
- Only when I want it done right.

202
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,349
I can make myself look stupid,
but I hate it when some clerk does.

203
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,690
I was under the impression
you never touch a book anymore.

204
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,460
Little secret between you and me.

205
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,859
If the amoebas find out you're willing
to read, you lose their respect.

206
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,839
Personnel approaching security office,

207
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,529
- Hello, Mr. McDonald.
- Howard, got a minute?

208
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,410
Sure.

209
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,269
I saw the Series 7500 video
surveillance system you suggested.

210
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,150
Do I need cellular override
and digital link?

211
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,400
- It seems a little overkill.
- Better safe than sorry.

212
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:35,220
They said it was true, but I didn't
believe them. Damn, here it is!

213
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,750
Evil white folks
really do have a mecca.

214
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,210
Now, girls, don't get riled up,

215
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,950
You just step on my foot?
Was that my foot you stepped on?

216
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,130
Are you assaulting me
Up in this haven of justice?

217
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,160
Somebody get me a lawyer.

218
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,000
My civil rights
have seriously been violated.

219
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:05,259
I get it. You all can cater
to the demon and the dead man...

220
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,700
...but what about the black man?

221
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,059
I'd love to stay and chat, but....
Yo, fellas!

222
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:29,609
We got a vampire on the premises.
Repeat, a vampire.

223
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:47,720
Well, looks like you got
your hands full so....

224
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,410
Thank you, Wesley.

225
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:47,269
What's all the excitement? A vampire
in the lobby, did I hear that right?

226
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,289
Never a dull moment.

227
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,200
We're done. Get out now.

228
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,430
Can you believe this? It's a sweep.

229
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,069
I'll never make my lunch.

230
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,740
What is it?

231
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,089
Mind readers.

232
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,960
Shouldn't we have been memoed?

233
00:23:38,569 --> 00:23:41,240
That's why they're called
random mind readings.

234
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,700
It's Lilah. It looks like I won't
be able to make the 1:00. Great.

235
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:36,289
I have to say this is a shame.
It's just a shame.

236
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:41,230
Whenever I hear of disloyalty,
it hurts me.

237
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,690
Hurts me personally.

238
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:50,759
But this sort of thing
must be dealt with quickly...

239
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:53,839
...and cleanly.

240
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,710
And unambiguously.

241
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:10,490
- I'm sorry, Lee, I truly am.
- What? No.

242
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,390
You've been in secret talks
with Klein and Gabler.

243
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:17,700
They approached me.

244
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,420
You planned on taking
clients with you.

245
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:22,849
You don't understand.
They misread me.

246
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:24,829
I wanted them to think--

247
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:36,329
Terminating an employee
is never pleasant.

248
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:39,619
That's all.

249
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,109
Lindsey.

250
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,069
Why don't you hang on for a minute?

251
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:04,220
- Lindsey?
- He's not with you?

252
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,339
That can't be good.

253
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,069
Something must've happened.

254
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,539
You're not going back?

255
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:15,079
If he made it, he'll come. If not,
there's nothing I can do. We're busy.

256
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:18,720
- So you got the files then?
- Right here.

257
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:24,049
- Which one is it?
- I don't know. We'll have to find it.

258
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,410
Angel, what's this?

259
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:30,799
I'm not sure.

260
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,259
- Ancient Aramaic, if I'm not mistaken.
- Yeah?

261
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,180
- Was there a reason you took this?
- Yeah.

262
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:48,410
And that would be...?

263
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:53,920
I don't really know.

264
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:58,000
Well, I'll get to work
translating them.

265
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,529
Guys? Might want to
translate this first.

266
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:10,349
- It's encrypted.
- I bet the rest of these are too.

267
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:12,369
Great.

268
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:24,470
What a pity. You can't get that
out of the carpet.

269
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:27,549
Believe me, we've tried.

270
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:36,690
Are you afraid?

271
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:43,140
I can see why. You betrayed
this firm by allying yourself...

272
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:47,099
...with someone who has given us
a great deal of grief.

273
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:51,509
You've stolen important documents
from our vault.

274
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:55,140
Tried to sabotaged
an extremely important case.

275
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:59,019
And in the course of this
egregious behavior, you lied to us.

276
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,339
More importantly, to me.

277
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,640
Did I leave anything out?

278
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,009
No, sir.

279
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,779
Did you actually believe
I wouldn't learn everything?

280
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,240
Lindsey, this is a delicate moment.

281
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:21,720
I nod to Phil behind me, and he'll
put a bullet in your head.

282
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,950
I didn't want to lie to you.
I didn't want to betray you.

283
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:30,940
I just wanted out.

284
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,769
Well then, you're in a crisis, son.

285
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,890
A crisis of faith.

286
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,859
Do you believe in love?

287
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,349
I'm not speaking romantically.

288
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,440
I'm talking about that sharp,
clear sense of self a man gains...

289
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:51,650
...once he's truly found
his place in the world.

290
00:28:52,089 --> 00:28:56,549
It's no mean feat, since most men are
cowards and just move with the crowd.

291
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:01,289
A very few make their own destinies.

292
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:05,380
They have moral courage, and they
know how to behave in a crisis.

293
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:08,420
Like now?

294
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,680
Like now.

295
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,630
You have everything it takes
to go all the way:

296
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,799
Drive, ambition, excellence.

297
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:21,410
But you don't know where you belong.

298
00:29:22,089 --> 00:29:23,809
And until you do...

299
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,799
...we both have some
important questions to answer.

300
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,099
Now, my first one is:

301
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,289
Do I nod to my friend behind me?

302
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:39,690
No.

303
00:29:40,089 --> 00:29:44,509
No, I don't. Because I know you,
and I know something about character.

304
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:49,740
What you actually need is
a few days off to think about it.

305
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:54,220
And I'm sure once you have,
you're gonna do the right thing.

306
00:29:56,289 --> 00:29:57,799
I can-- I can go?

307
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:02,279
You can go.

308
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:06,690
Lindsey.

309
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:09,730
I believe in you.

310
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,920
Look deep enough inside yourself.

311
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,289
You'll find that love.

312
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,980
I'm back to the desktop,
Willow. What do I do now?

313
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:28,059
Okay, done that. Back to file list.

314
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:31,920
Any luck?

315
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,460
She's been on the phone for two hours.

316
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,240
Guess what they've been doing?

317
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,890
- Saving the world?
- Well, yeah.

318
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:43,059
They've been breaking
encrypted computer files too.

319
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,490
- What are the odds, huh?
- I know. What?

320
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:50,650
- Oh, no one. Just Wesley.
- Cordelia, can she get us in?

321
00:30:56,809 --> 00:30:59,549
- Willow says hey.
- Hey.

322
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,809
Okay. Yeah.

323
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:04,039
I see it.

324
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:06,710
Tag file. Okay.

325
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:08,769
Left click.

326
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:11,690
There it is. Back door.

327
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,869
We're in. Thanks, Will.

328
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:18,890
Personnel file, Vanessa Brewer.

329
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:24,470
She lost her sight when she was 21.

330
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:28,339
- On purpose. She did it to herself.
- Oh, dear.

331
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:32,650
And she spent five years in Pajaur,
studying the Nanjin...

332
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,619
- ...which explains her power.
- It does?

333
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,289
Yes, the order of the Nanjin,
cave-dwelling monks.

334
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:42,960
They believe enlightenment
is seeing with the heart, not mind.

335
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:47,470
So self-mutilating, psycho assassin
chick reached enlightenment?

336
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:52,309
She's more sensitive to her
surroundings than a sighted person...

337
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:57,670
- ...which makes her unstoppable.
- No one's unstoppable. What's her job?

338
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,140
Here it is. Lindsey was right.

339
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:04,000
Children. Three of them. Seers.

340
00:32:04,609 --> 00:32:08,579
Found in different remote areas,
brought together for the first time.

341
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:13,799
They're blind. Together, they have
power to see into the heart of things.

342
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:17,400
A holy triumvirate.
As they mature, so does their power.

343
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:22,410
Which makes them a real threat
to Wolfram and Hart. Sorry I'm late.

344
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:26,049
- I hope you didn't worry.
- We figured you were dead.

345
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,960
So you made it out okay.

346
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:31,799
Yeah, but they'll soon find out
which files are missing.

347
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:35,549
We gotta move fast.
When do the children arrive?

348
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:37,210
They came this morning.

349
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:40,700
They're at a safe house
until their mentor arrives.

350
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,690
- He's coming in tonight.
- Not safe. There's an address.

351
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:48,529
Intercept the mentor.
Keep him away from that house.

352
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:51,890
- We'll bring the kids to him.
- Okay.

353
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,720
Get the kids out of here!

354
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,639
It's all right. You're all right.

355
00:35:39,769 --> 00:35:42,190
The children are safe
with their mentor.

356
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:43,750
Good.

357
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:48,539
They have an important role to play.

358
00:35:49,969 --> 00:35:52,989
This is how Wolfram and Hart
knew of their coming.

359
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:00,960
- You know what it is?
- The Prophecies of Aberjian, I think.

360
00:36:01,969 --> 00:36:05,300
For centuries, thought lost.
I translated some of the text.

361
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:08,449
It mentions
the children you saved today.

362
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:12,929
I also believe
I know why you were drawn to it.

363
00:36:13,969 --> 00:36:16,530
There's an entire passage about you.

364
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:22,980
It doesn't call you by name,
but it tells of a vampire with a soul.

365
00:36:25,969 --> 00:36:29,090
- This doesn't surprise you?
- No.

366
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:33,539
- You said you didn't know what it was.
- I didn't, but--

367
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:37,320
- Somehow you did?
- Yeah.

368
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:42,789
There is a design, Angel.
Hidden in the chaos as it may be...

369
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:44,380
...but it's there.

370
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:48,090
And you have your place in it.

371
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,440
Holland.

372
00:37:07,969 --> 00:37:09,480
Hello, Lindsey.

373
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:13,780
I'm sorry. I did what I had to.

374
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:17,030
You saved the children.
That's very noble.

375
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,619
- I brought the disks back.
- Of course, you made copies.

376
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:24,010
A few things.
Just enough to keep me safe.

377
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:28,420
- What does safe mean to you?
- Not warring with Wolfram and Hart.

378
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:33,010
- Having my own life.
- Haven't you learned anything?

379
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:36,300
No one has that.
We're all parts of a whole.

380
00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:38,909
Like Wolfram and Hart.

381
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,119
I picked you when you were
a sophomore at Hastings...

382
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:44,699
...not because you were smart...

383
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:48,429
...or a poor kid who had
to do better than anyone else...

384
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:53,300
...but because you had potential
for seeing things as they are.

385
00:37:54,769 --> 00:37:58,840
It's not about good or evil.
It's about who wields the most power.

386
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,800
We wield a lot,
and the world's better for it.

387
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,659
- I didn't come back--
- Why did you come back?

388
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:10,099
To return some disks?
Take a moral stand?

389
00:38:10,369 --> 00:38:11,630
I don't think so.

390
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,449
You called me by my first name.

391
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:18,650
You never did that before.
You wouldn't have had the nerve.

392
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:22,780
But you're different now.
You stood up to us and won.

393
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,849
You know how many people
have that nerve?

394
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:31,139
I can count them on one hand. I need
people like that working for us.

395
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:39,360
- You're offering me my job back?
- No. I'm offering you a new job.

396
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:44,269
A permanent one, with a thundering
raise and ungodly benefits.

397
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:48,929
In fact, I'm offering you
this very office.

398
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,050
I'm going upstairs.

399
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:55,489
What I'm offering you, Lindsey,
is the world.

400
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:59,449
I know you pretty well,
and I bet you'll take it.

401
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:06,760
You may not know me
as well as you think.

402
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:12,539
As I told you, it's a decision
each person has to make for himself.

403
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:17,760
If you want it, it's yours.
If you don't, walk out this door.

404
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,849
I'm going upstairs now.
