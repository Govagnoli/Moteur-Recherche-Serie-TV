1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:02,799
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:05,410
There are forces
you know nothing about.

3
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:08,730
You think I'll stand by
while you finish the game?

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,640
Police. Nobody move!

5
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:16,600
Stay down or they'll kill you.

6
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:23,379
- Darla, how are you?
- I'm fine, Holland.

7
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:27,039
They brought her back.
I need to know why. Why human?

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,190
You were given a second chance.
Don't throw it away--

9
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,429
- I'm dying.
- Syphilitic heart condition. Terminal.

10
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:36,119
I won't leave you.
Every moment you have...

11
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:39,399
...I'll be by your side.
You'll never be alone.

12
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:47,689
How did you think this would end?

13
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,599
We're almost there.
Anybody home?

14
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:07,640
- Oh, my God.
- What happened?

15
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,879
He's been in and out.
Only got half the story.

16
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,189
- It didn't make sense.
- Angel?

17
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,989
- There's no time, no time.
- Let's sit him down here.

18
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,400
- Where was he?
- The motel.

19
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,340
- Darla's?
- Should've heard them.

20
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:22,930
I got him to the truck
before he burst into flames.

21
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:23,840
He's hurt.

22
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:25,849
Something not good went down.

23
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,159
- Angel?
- I was just so tired.

24
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:31,329
- Where is Darla?
- I don't know.

25
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:33,359
I knew it. She did this to him.

26
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,260
- I knew she couldn't be trusted.
- She's dead.

27
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:39,120
- What?
- I should've stopped them.

28
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,239
- They made her drink.
- Angel?

29
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,620
She didn't want to.
You think that you can resist...

30
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,409
...but then it's too late.

31
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,159
- Someone made Darla drink?
- It was her.

32
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:53,480
Way too many pronouns here.
Who's "her"?

33
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:55,459
Drusilla.

34
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:59,450
- Drusilla's here?
- Good lord.

35
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:01,359
Who's Drusilla?

36
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,810
Angel?

37
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,400
Angel?

38
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,620
I'm guessing she's got a set of teeth?

39
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,800
- Yes, she's a vampire.
- I'm getting the picture.

40
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,750
- You should sit.
- I must find her.

41
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,199
Drusilla?

42
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,300
She ain't in there.

43
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:23,169
- He's delirious.
- I can save her.

44
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,210
- Save whom?
- Darla.

45
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,300
If what you say is so, there's no
saving Darla. It's too late.

46
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,860
- It's not too late.
- It is.

47
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,610
She's dead already
and she will rise again.

48
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,349
She won't.
I can save her from that.

49
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:35,219
I'm still trying to get this
family tree straight.

50
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,729
- Darla sired Angel.
- Correct.

51
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:40,870
- Angel sired Drusilla.
- When he and Darla were together.

52
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:43,840
- But before Angel got his soul back?
- Certainly.

53
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:46,659
These lawyers brought
Darla back as human.

54
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:50,289
- Now this Drusilla bites Darla?
- So it would seem.

55
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:53,750
- Making her a vampire again.
- That's the cosmological upshot.

56
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,650
Darla's human self has died, and
before dawn, unless Angel stops it...

57
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:01,870
...she will rise again,
a soulless demon.

58
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:04,030
- That means--
- Clock is ticking.

59
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:08,430
What I'm saying is, the granddaughter
remade the grandmother.

60
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,219
Oh. Yes.

61
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,379
Man, that weirds me out
more than the blood-sucking thing.

62
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,449
How do you feel?

63
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,009
What do you got?

64
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,439
Sunset is at 5:47 pm,
which...

65
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,769
...was six minutes ago,
and sunrise is at 6:15 am.

66
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:34,449
It could happen anytime before then.

67
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,720
Anything?

68
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,839
Lindsey McDonald's assistant says
he's in the office, but in a meeting.

69
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,319
- Has been all day.
- Right.

70
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:46,910
You can't go into
those offices undetected.

71
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:49,379
I'm not going to.
That's what they want.

72
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,250
You don't believe he's there.

73
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:53,680
I was at the only meeting
Lindsey had today.

74
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,220
- So where are you going?
- To his home.

75
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:57,819
- I'll go with you.
- We all will.

76
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,860
No. You're all staying here.

77
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:03,069
You can't go in uninvited.
You need us.

78
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:04,560
Not this time.

79
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,339
What's the plan?
Stand outside and make remarks?

80
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,389
He invited me in once.

81
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:13,160
This time, when I kick that door down,
I go through it. Alone.

82
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,779
Excuse me.
The open house isn't until Saturday.

83
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,029
Where is the man who lived here?

84
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,980
Moved.

85
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,939
When?

86
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:58,779
- The truck was here yesterday.
- Did he leave a forwarding address?

87
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:01,730
I can't give out--

88
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,009
It's an emergency,
regarding a friend...

89
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,779
...who's in need of some
immediate medical attention.

90
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:13,779
Well, he's asked that I forward
everything to his place of employment.

91
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:17,069
- Do you know where that is?
- Yeah.

92
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:19,689
Thanks.

93
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:24,870
This is about the cousin, isn't it?

94
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:27,870
- Cousin?
- That sweet...

95
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:31,009
...but very odd English girl
who was visiting him?

96
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:33,410
Yeah. Yes, it is.

97
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:35,779
I knew that pregnancy was in trouble.

98
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,129
Thin as a rail.
Couldn't be healthy for the baby.

99
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:40,829
She's having a baby?

100
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:44,379
She was very excited about
getting the nursery ready.

101
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,180
Of course.
Dru would want the ritual.

102
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,230
She wasn't interested,
wanted something on the west side.

103
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:54,730
She insisted her daughter
be born near the stars.

104
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:57,589
- Stars?
- Well, she's foreign.

105
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:03,120
I told her you can live your whole
life in L.A. and never see a star.

106
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:10,360
I can hear them singing to me.

107
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:28,009
So this place works for you?

108
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,829
Oh, yeah.

109
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:33,899
Grandmother is very pleased with it.

110
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,449
I can tell.

111
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:40,149
Aren't you, Grandmother?

112
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:44,420
- My daughter.
- Can she hear you?

113
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,579
She's dead.

114
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:53,319
Oh. Of course.

115
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,750
Shh. Just for now.

116
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,399
Got a shot with her now?

117
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,470
- Lilah....
- Don't let me interrupt you.

118
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:07,930
Drusilla, you are positively glowing.

119
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:12,019
- I'm going to be a mummy.
- Yes. Yes, you are.

120
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:15,970
- Is there anything you need?
- No.

121
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,379
If you do,
you know how to contact us.

122
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:23,339
We would love to stay for the birth,
but we have a previous engagement.

123
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,019
- I have preparations to make myself.
- Of course you do.

124
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:30,230
And we'll leave you to it, then.

125
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:40,539
- Lindsey?
- Maybe I should stay.

126
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,519
This is a family matter, Lindsey.
We'd best leave it that way.

127
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,120
Run and catch

128
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,409
Run and catch

129
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:54,129
The lamb is caught...

130
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:57,860
...in the blackberry patch

131
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:07,070
Here's the list of local cemeteries,
funeral homes and mausoleums.

132
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:10,610
We have to go to each place
and dig up graves?

133
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:13,919
- She'll want the body in the ground.
- Are you certain?

134
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:16,539
Burial isn't necessary
for a new vampire.

135
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,429
- Will be for her. She's a classicist.
- She's a loony.

136
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:23,100
Stick with cemeteries
with a view of the night sky.

137
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:27,399
- So just outside cemeteries, then?
- Doesn't narrow it down much.

138
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:32,549
If it's just a burial she's after, one
doesn't need a cemetery. Just dirt.

139
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,190
Still not narrowing.
Whole planet, made up of dirt.

140
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,769
Maybe I'm looking at this wrong.

141
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,679
Dru doesn't see this thing
as a death, but as a birth.

142
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,559
She talked about the nursery.

143
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:47,700
I fear you may be looking
for a logical pattern...

144
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,120
...in the rantings of someone
who isn't logical.

145
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,720
Soil.

146
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:56,100
Soil near the stars.
She wanted to be near the stars.

147
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:01,600
She talked to them. She spent hours
in my garden communing with the sky.

148
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:05,870
Maybe she didn't mean baby nursery.
You said she liked the garden.

149
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,659
Plant nursery's got dirt, the view.

150
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,490
It's more a birth than a death place.

151
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:14,169
Maybe if we find one up high,
that'll be it.

152
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:17,100
Maybe one with a relationship
with Wolfram & Hart.

153
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:21,580
Large firm like that, they may do
business with a corporate supplier.

154
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,870
That's not a fitting gift at all
for our newborn grandmummy.

155
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:04,960
I saw you coming, my lovely.
The moon showed me.

156
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,669
It told me to come
into the 20th century.

157
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,279
It's the 21st century, Dru.

158
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:13,259
I'm still lagging.

159
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,919
Now everybody's home.

160
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,679
Baby's up from her little nap.

161
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,590
Grandmum!

162
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,990
Angel?

163
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:35,230
- How'd it go?
- Gear up. We need to move fast.

164
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:36,789
I guess not great?

165
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,399
- They're out there.
- So you did find them?

166
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:41,340
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

167
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:44,159
- You know where they'll be?
- Not exactly.

168
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:47,830
- Yet you have your suspicions?
- Actually, I don't.

169
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:50,549
- It's more like a hunch.
- Not a hunch.

170
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:53,860
Would you say inkling?
Please tell me you could say that.

171
00:14:54,409 --> 00:14:56,409
If we find them before they join up...

172
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:59,159
...we can stop something ugly
before it starts.

173
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:03,990
I don't think the four of us
in one car is going to yield results.

174
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,509
Which is why we'll follow
the one solid lead we have.

175
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:11,370
- We'll go to Wolfram & Hart.
- Hit the pause button.

176
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:15,919
Wolfram & Hart? Vampire detectors,
security system and armed guards?

177
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,039
- Nice plan, General Custer.
- Drusilla's insane. Deadly.

178
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:23,870
Darla needs to feed.
Once she does, she'll be stronger.

179
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:27,889
Either we go back to the people
who brought them here...

180
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,100
...or we sit and wait
for the bodies to pile up.

181
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,799
I decided not to wait. If you want
to join me, my car's outside.

182
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,460
If not, that's fine too.

183
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:41,549
- You had me at "Everyone gear up."
- Let's go.

184
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:53,870
Lindsey, my wife wants to know if
you're bringing a date this evening.

185
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,490
Something about how many
crab cakes to order.

186
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,549
No, I don't have a date.

187
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,820
You've been doing stellar work. Don't
think the partners haven't noticed.

188
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,159
- I'm happy to hear that.
- Your work isn't all they notice.

189
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:16,100
It's also important to have healthy
attachments outside of the office.

190
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,059
I know our roles don't allow
much time to socialize.

191
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:23,559
- Find the time.
- Yes, sir.

192
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:27,929
Don't be late. I'm uncorking
a case of 1928 Chateau Latour.

193
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,649
- I wouldn't miss it.
- We've worked hard.

194
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:32,169
Let's enjoy our success.

195
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,379
I drank Chateau Latour once.

196
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,250
- It tasted like lion's blood.
- Drusilla. I apologize.

197
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,559
I didn't realize you were here.

198
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:46,960
I trust everything went as you hoped.

199
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,480
I'm very worried about Grandmum.

200
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:54,649
The building was quite tall, you know.

201
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,019
Darla's a survivor.

202
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,009
- Angelus wasn't happy in the least.
- Angel found you?

203
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:08,549
Well, not unexpected.
How did he fare?

204
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,769
Angelus is on his way here now.

205
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,980
He's very cross.

206
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:21,859
I wouldn't worry about that.
We've taken precautions.

207
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:25,420
The important thing is that
we reunite you with your baby.

208
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:29,700
Yes?

209
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:34,319
General alert. An untamed
vampire is in the building.

210
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,220
Perhaps we should take
our guest to security.

211
00:17:41,569 --> 00:17:42,440
Darla.

212
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,779
Lindsey, no sudden movement.

213
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:56,630
Warm.

214
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,460
Let them leave the building
without incident.

215
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:22,670
Healthy attachments, Lindsey.

216
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,230
It's no good if we don't
get there in one piece.

217
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,460
We don't have much time.

218
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,380
- Angel, pull over.
- I'll slow down.

219
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,430
No, she's having a vision.

220
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:48,160
Tell me it ain't us she's seeing
wrapped around a lamppost.

221
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:55,359
It's the other way. Turn around!

222
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,279
- We're almost there.
- Angel.

223
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:01,670
- She should've done this before.
- Angel!

224
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,930
Maybe it's a false alarm.

225
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:26,450
Did I do something to displease you?

226
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,259
Grandmother, why?

227
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,480
Don't be angry.

228
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,460
Why?

229
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,390
For you.

230
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,680
All for you.

231
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:03,369
I thought it was what you wanted.
To be saved.

232
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,460
All alone.

233
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,420
All alone in the dirt.

234
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:20,029
We've lost our way, and the little
wormy won't dance if he's told to.

235
00:20:20,329 --> 00:20:22,859
No. No.

236
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,190
You two want to move it
out of the street?

237
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,000
That's right, sweetheart.

238
00:20:41,329 --> 00:20:43,859
Why don't you and your girlfriend
make out at home?

239
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:46,259
The rest of us have lives.

240
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,410
Not for long.

241
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,309
You're all new again.

242
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,579
Let's go shopping.

243
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:33,829
Morgog, I worship you.

244
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,240
Ruler of the universe, I will throw
out my worthless life to you.

245
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,910
Morgog.

246
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,849
- What do you want?
- We're here to help.

247
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:49,359
I have to do this. Morgog
commands me. His will be done.

248
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:52,299
- Don't! You stay back.
- Easy, boss.

249
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,640
He's ready to snap, crackle and pop.
I felt it in my vision.

250
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,440
We've got to handle him with care.
You know, delicate.

251
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,799
- Wait, jeez. Oh, jeez.
- Listen. I'm not here to hurt you.

252
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,859
Morgog's not the way. He couldn't
find his hump without a map.

253
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,680
So don't kill yourself.
He's not worth it.

254
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:18,470
And you've got, you know,
a million reasons to live. I bet.

255
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,099
Okay? Got it? Good.

256
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:23,039
- We're not done.
- I am.

257
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,720
There's a reason why we're here.

258
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:29,170
- I don't have time for this.
- Maybe that's the plan.

259
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,319
And that young man
still needs our help.

260
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,019
Go help him. I got
more important things to do.

261
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,259
Can I have it? Can I?

262
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:50,279
Of course. But a little color
would bring out your eyes more.

263
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,390
- Such pretty eyes.
- Men are drawn to them.

264
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,160
Aren't they, though?

265
00:22:57,529 --> 00:22:59,630
- Here.
- Ooh.

266
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,619
Ooh. I'm ringing.

267
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,529
Do you hear it?

268
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:09,259
I'm ringing all over.

269
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,319
Oh, yeah. Forgot about that.

270
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,160
Hello, Holland.

271
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:23,420
Darla. Feeling better, I trust.

272
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,769
- Like my old self again,
- Splendid,

273
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:30,970
I understand you girls
have been on a little spree,

274
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,009
- Is that a problem?
- On the contrary,

275
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,009
As a matter of fact,
I was just thinking,

276
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,240
Why settle for a spree
when you could have, say...

277
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,089
...a massacre?

278
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,259
- A massacre?
- Ooh.

279
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:48,630
I like the sound of that.

280
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,500
Of course, you have the support
of Wolfram & Hart behind you.

281
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,990
I appreciate that.

282
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:57,369
Not at all, Darla.
That's what we're here for.

283
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:02,960
Do you like it?

284
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:06,440
- Am I pretty, then?
- As a picture.

285
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,220
Now if we can only get
some shoes to go with it.

286
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:12,980
Excuse me, miss.

287
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,539
Any shoe suggestions
for my friend's ensemble?

288
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:21,720
I said, excuse me.
Customer with a question here.

289
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:29,000
Service in this place
is really unacceptable.

290
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,049
They'll keep Angel busy.

291
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,859
- Until he kills them.
- He'll find that...

292
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:45,160
...more difficult than he realizes.

293
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:48,720
Lilah's correct.
We won't have to worry about Angel--

294
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:54,190
- Dru and Darla, where are they?
- Angel.

295
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,700
I don't believe
we've had the pleasure.

296
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,559
I'd be careful who
you offer that hand to.

297
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,940
You might just lose it.
Isn't that right, Lindsey?

298
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:06,400
There's worse things to lose,
aren't there?

299
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,079
- So you pull the strings here.
- A few of them.

300
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,740
- I am Head of Special Projects.
- Projects like Darla?

301
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:20,029
Darla's just a tool.
Means to an end.

302
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,430
You're the project.

303
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,279
I can take your life
before they lift a finger.

304
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,240
I'm sure you can.
As sure as I am you won't.

305
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:37,079
- Won't I?
- You don't kill humans.

306
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:40,500
You don't qualify.
You set things in motion.

307
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:45,710
Play your little games up here in your
glass tower and innocent people die.

308
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:48,549
And yet, I just can't seem to care.

309
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,670
But you do.

310
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:58,140
While you make threats and waste time,
crashing through windows...

311
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,920
...your girls are out
painting the town red, red, red.

312
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,750
- Where?
- That would be telling.

313
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:07,079
In any case, you should hurry.

314
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:11,019
Lives hang in the balance, waiting
for their champion to save them.

315
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:20,549
Mm-hm. You'll let me walk out of here?

316
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:24,329
As a matter of fact, I will.
You misunderstand us, Angel.

317
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:28,180
We don't want you dead. Yet.

318
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,460
If we did, you wouldn't
be standing here.

319
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:34,460
Please escort our guest
out of the building.

320
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:38,980
I'd walk you out myself,
but I'm late for a wine tasting.

321
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,880
And just so we're clear
on the matter...

322
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:44,599
...you're not invited.

323
00:26:52,089 --> 00:26:53,839
I'll send a bill for the window.

324
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:57,400
After I stop Darla and Dru,
I'll pay you in person.

325
00:26:58,089 --> 00:27:01,250
Yeah. Go do your champion thing.
Then come see me.

326
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,690
If you make bail. Give him a nice
holding cell, officers. With a window.

327
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,380
Southern exposure preferred.

328
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:11,950
The firm may not want you dead...

329
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,900
- ...but I'm cool with it.
- Watch your head.

330
00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:24,369
Perfect.

331
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:26,559
Go.

332
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:33,819
How do you want to do this? Should I
escape now or wait? Because I'm not--

333
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,039
Two people were murdered
in a clothing store.

334
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,720
Reports say two women were spotted.

335
00:27:40,089 --> 00:27:42,759
One matches the description
of your pal, Darla.

336
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,779
They're not done, are they?

337
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,400
No.

338
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,359
Why are you telling me this?

339
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,900
Because I don't think
I can stop them.

340
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:06,299
Maybe you can. Pull over.

341
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:36,119
- Lindsey, welcome.
- Good evening, Catherine.

342
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:40,000
Holland's downstairs
lording over his wine cellar.

343
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:43,430
These are lovely. Thank you.

344
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:47,019
The senior partners have informed me
they are very pleased...

345
00:28:47,849 --> 00:28:49,920
...with the work
our division has done.

346
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,319
Things have been
progressing nicely...

347
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,619
...and ahead of schedule,
I might add.

348
00:28:56,849 --> 00:28:59,940
I'd be remiss without
extending well-earned praise...

349
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:04,069
...to the two members of our team
who made it possible.

350
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:08,369
- Lilah Morgan and Lindsey McDonald.
- Thank you, Holland.

351
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,720
It's no secret our work is
one small element...

352
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,609
...in a much larger, greater plan.

353
00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:18,299
One which the senior
partners hoped....

354
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,839
Ladies.

355
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:34,490
- How--?
- Your wife kindly invited us in.

356
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,250
- Ah.
- Very sweet, she was.

357
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,089
Like clover.

358
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:41,559
And honey.

359
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:46,000
Think of it as our way
of giving you what you want.

360
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:51,250
- What would I...?
- I believe you said something about...

361
00:29:56,849 --> 00:29:58,779
...a massacre.

362
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,690
Just keep that area blocked off.

363
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:04,390
Pretty lawyers, all in a row.
Eenie-meenie....

364
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:11,029
I'm glad you're alive, Darla.
I'm glad we were able to save you.

365
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:12,660
Are you?

366
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:16,960
I guess you really care
about me as a person.

367
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,000
I guess I owe all of you.

368
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:24,730
The whole team.

369
00:31:29,609 --> 00:31:32,170
You have beautiful skin.

370
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,240
I moisturize.

371
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,599
That was very thoughtful of you.

372
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:43,529
You brought me back as human.
A dying one, at that.

373
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:46,990
Let me wallow with a soul,
then sent me back to Angel...

374
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:48,910
...for him to restore me.

375
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:53,170
Which he should have done
right away. But I miscalculated.

376
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:55,049
I thought he cared more.

377
00:31:56,009 --> 00:31:57,660
Like you do.

378
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,480
Grandmum won't eat the doublespeak.

379
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:04,079
No. No, she won't eat that.

380
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,720
It's okay. It's all over.
They're gone now.

381
00:32:29,609 --> 00:32:32,170
- They killed those people.
- I know.

382
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,740
The police are here.
They'll take care of you.

383
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:38,210
You were in here the entire time?

384
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,619
I needed a new dress
for the office party.

385
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:47,420
This one was too expensive,
but I couldn't make up my mind.

386
00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:51,549
I kept thinking they would
come in and kill me too.

387
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:54,940
Did you see or hear any of it?

388
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,809
I mostly heard.

389
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,480
I was lucky because of the party.

390
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:04,140
- It's okay. You'll make your party.
- No, their party.

391
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:08,940
- They were in a hurry to get to it.
- They said something about a party?

392
00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:13,049
A tasting.

393
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:20,200
You just go on outside
and find an officer.

394
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,720
You'll be okay.

395
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,599
Thank you.

396
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:30,759
It was just too much.

397
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,710
I hear the sirens.

398
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:39,259
They don't know if the world
will be there in the morning.

399
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,859
Do you hear the sirens?
Are the police coming?

400
00:33:44,609 --> 00:33:45,480
No.

401
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,069
She senses what this place
was built for.

402
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:55,279
Yes, you're right. This was originally
a bomb shelter in the '50s.

403
00:33:56,009 --> 00:34:00,579
We had it converted.
Wine has always been my passion.

404
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:03,690
People...

405
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,950
...huddled together...

406
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,859
...crouching in fear.

407
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:11,840
I imagine that's what it
would have been like in a war.

408
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,210
No. Now.

409
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:17,559
She means now.

410
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,579
Ah-ha.

411
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:22,150
I guess I stepped into that one.

412
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,349
Listen, Darla, I am sorry
that you had to suffer...

413
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:28,500
...but look what's come out of it.

414
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:32,699
You've been restored.
You're a superior being.

415
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,679
You can have anything.

416
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:39,219
There's not a person who won't work
around the clock to see you get it.

417
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,550
Gung ho, are they?

418
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:46,989
Because all I'm sensing right now
is big, stinky fear.

419
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,440
But not from you.

420
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,429
You know what I'm getting
from you, Lindsey?

421
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,239
Nothing.

422
00:35:04,409 --> 00:35:06,269
Why aren't you afraid?

423
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,170
I don't know.

424
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:13,530
You could die here.
Chances are, you will.

425
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:17,139
Yeah.

426
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,869
- And you don't care?
- I care.

427
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:23,949
I guess I just don't mind.

428
00:35:25,409 --> 00:35:28,889
No one's dying. It's a friendly
get-together amongst colleagues.

429
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,860
We're all on the same side.

430
00:35:34,409 --> 00:35:37,289
I love this room. Dru, honey.

431
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:42,050
In our new digs,
we have to put in a people cellar.

432
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,110
Help us.

433
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:03,139
Daddy's home.

434
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:11,010
Angelus.

435
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:19,579
- Here for the tasting?
- Look what we have for you.

436
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:26,750
It's not Daddy. It's never Daddy.

437
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,670
It's the Angel-beast.

438
00:36:30,929 --> 00:36:34,719
- Come to punish us.
- Yeah. Yeah.

439
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:39,099
Spank us till Tuesday.
We promise to be bad if you do.

440
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,860
Angel....

441
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:48,980
- I'm sorry I didn't get there in time.
- I'm not.

442
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,989
He's soul-sick.

443
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:55,440
Not even thinking about
his own family.

444
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,300
Only thinking about them.

445
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:03,139
Come on, love. I never did
get that goodbye kiss.

446
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,179
You will.

447
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,969
But not tonight.

448
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:18,309
- For God's sake, help us.
- Angel, please.

449
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:23,190
People are going to die.

450
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:28,300
And yet, somehow,
I just can't seem to care.

451
00:37:30,929 --> 00:37:33,210
Angel, please. We can negotiate.

452
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,579
Daddy.

453
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:47,079
No, no!
They're killing us! Killing us!

454
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,750
And you just walked away?

455
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:01,199
No, I walked to my car
and then I drove away.

456
00:38:03,929 --> 00:38:05,610
You didn't do anything?

457
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,550
You gave Darla and Drusilla free rein?

458
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,760
I didn't bring either of them
into this. They did.

459
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,199
- You could've stopped them.
- I will.

460
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,760
When? After they've finished off
the people you don't like?

461
00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:24,449
It's true these lawyers
brought this on themselves.

462
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,510
But what you did--

463
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,190
- Is wrong.
- You went too far.

464
00:38:33,329 --> 00:38:37,789
We've all been worried about you.
I guess we share some of the blame.

465
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,190
- We should've spoken up sooner.
- And louder.

466
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,079
You have to change the way
you do things.

467
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:47,610
Don't you see
where this is taking you?

468
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:53,989
Right now the three of us are all
that stands between you and darkness.

469
00:38:54,929 --> 00:38:56,440
Best believe that, man.

470
00:39:00,329 --> 00:39:01,409
I do.

471
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,139
You're all fired.

472
00:39:57,329 --> 00:39:59,219
Thank you, thank you very much,
