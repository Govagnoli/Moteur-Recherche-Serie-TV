1
00:00:03,594 --> 00:00:06,825
- We need to act on this now.
- Not without a full-risk analysis.

2
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:08,831
We don't wanna be rushing
into this thing half-cocked.

3
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:12,562
As opposed to the full-cock
that's been working so well for us?

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,570
You got something you wanna say?

5
00:00:14,672 --> 00:00:18,802
Just don't wanna lose another baby
with the bathwater, boss.

6
00:00:18,909 --> 00:00:20,877
Fine. We'll send Spike.

7
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:23,276
- Bugger that. Do it yourself.
- [Beeping]

8
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:26,817
Spike, this is a delicate matter that needs
to be handled with a lot of finesse.

9
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:29,818
- And why the hell are we talking to him?
- Because he signed on to help.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,411
Not to be some
glorified garbage collector.

11
00:00:32,523 --> 00:00:34,457
It's not garbage. It's a body.

12
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:36,617
There's a bloody gang war coming our way
if we don't get it back.

13
00:00:36,727 --> 00:00:40,128
- Stiff s that important?
- It's the remains of the capo di famiglia...

14
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:42,392
- of the Goran demon clan.
- Never heard of him.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,799
That's 'cause the capo was human tolerant.
Kept a low profile.

16
00:00:45,903 --> 00:00:48,428
- More interested in profit than mayhem.
- What happened to him?

17
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,838
Died on a business trip in Italy.
We need to go there, retrieve his body...

18
00:00:51,942 --> 00:00:56,242
and return it to his family in the next...
[Inhales] ooh, 26 hours.

19
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,679
- Or what? He gets deader?
- No, he stays dead.

20
00:00:58,783 --> 00:01:01,115
They die, they pupate, they live again.

21
00:01:01,218 --> 00:01:04,016
But only if the proper rituals are performed
by the immediate family.

22
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:07,682
If the capo's body isn't returned in time,
the rituals won't take.

23
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:09,657
So long, capo.
Hello, power vacuum.

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,660
Which the rival clans
will try to fill.

25
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:13,457
And they aren't
as tolerant of humans.

26
00:01:13,564 --> 00:01:15,998
<i>If we do this,</i>
<i>it all stays cool. If not...</i>

27
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,159
- We'll stick with do. Okay, come on.
- Hey, hey.

28
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:20,601
- Pack your bags.
- I don't even speak the language.

29
00:01:20,704 --> 00:01:24,265
- We'll get you a book.
- How do you say "wank off' in Italian?

30
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:27,606
- Can somebody please just get on a plane?
- What?

31
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:30,009
When?

32
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:36,684
Yeah. I understand. Thanks.

33
00:01:36,787 --> 00:01:39,255
<i>All right. What is it this time?</i>

34
00:01:39,356 --> 00:01:43,224
Übervamps? Demon gods?
Devil robots?

35
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,660
It's Buffy.

36
00:02:43,988 --> 00:02:47,219
- I said, I'll take care of it.
- Take care of what?

37
00:02:47,324 --> 00:02:49,224
- Is Buffy all right?
- She will be when I get there.

38
00:02:49,326 --> 00:02:51,260
What happened?
What happened.

39
00:02:51,362 --> 00:02:56,857
- The Immortal.
- The who?

40
00:02:56,967 --> 00:03:01,063
- The foulest evil hell ever vomited forth.
- Worse than you?

41
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:03,503
- He was spotted in Rome near Buffy's...
- Wait a minute.

42
00:03:03,607 --> 00:03:05,802
Rome? That's were the capo died.

43
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,640
- That's definitely his M.O.
- The capo's?

44
00:03:08,746 --> 00:03:11,874
The Immortal. He whacks
the capo, lures me to Rome.

45
00:03:11,982 --> 00:03:14,542
Takes out a Slayer
and a vampire with a soul.

46
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:19,146
Plus, he starts a war when the capo's body
isn't returned for resurrection. This guy's good.

47
00:03:19,256 --> 00:03:23,249
So am I. Harmony, have the jet
fueled, ready for takeoff.

48
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,828
- Do you really think we can take him?
- Whoa. What do you mean "we"?

49
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,296
You don't think I'm gonna let you traipse off
to Italy without me, do you?

50
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:30,492
- You don't speak the language.
- I'll get a book.

51
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:33,001
- Spike, you're only going to make things worse.
- Oh.

52
00:03:33,103 --> 00:03:36,561
Look, we get the capo's body, we rescue Buffy,
we stop the Immortal. It's that simple.

53
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,972
- Unless he kills you, which would be sad.
- He's not gonna kill me.

54
00:03:39,076 --> 00:03:41,044
Not if I'm with ya.

55
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:46,778
Admit it. You think you're gonna ride in,
save the day and sweep Buffy off of her...

56
00:03:46,884 --> 00:03:49,444
- Like you're not thinking the same thing.
- I'm already seeing somebody.

57
00:03:49,553 --> 00:03:52,078
- What, dog girl?
- Nina's a werewolf.

58
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:55,283
Fido know her boyfriend's flying halfway
around the world to visit his ex?

59
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:58,793
Look, I was gonna call her, and we're just
hanging out. She's not my girlfriend.

60
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:01,763
- This rate, never will be.
- Doesn't concern you, Spike.

61
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:04,459
I just wanna see you happy.

62
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:08,368
Well, not too happy, 'cause then
I'd have to stake ya.

63
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:11,464
- Second thought, have at it.
- This isn't about us.

64
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:13,338
- You and Nina?
- Me and you.

<i>that's only gonna get worse...</i>

if we don't put aside our differences.

67
00:04:18,282 --> 00:04:21,740
We have to work together on this
to stop the Immortal and save Buffy.

69
00:04:23,988 --> 00:04:26,513
Oh, and pick up
that demon body thingy.

70
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:31,061
- Partners then?
- Just like old times.

71
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:35,360
- You want a drink?
- God, yes.

72
00:04:39,403 --> 00:04:41,963
Huh. Really can't
get drunk off these things.

73
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:44,336
Not us anyway.

74
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:49,037
Vampire constitution.
Not always a plus.

75
00:04:50,948 --> 00:04:54,042
- How'd you know?
- Drank a lot of them and I still don't like you.

76
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:57,848
- About Buffy. How did you know
she was in trouble?
- I got word.

77
00:04:57,955 --> 00:04:59,752
- From who?
- A source.

78
00:04:59,857 --> 00:05:04,385
- You've been spying on her?
- I just wanted to make sure she was all right.

79
00:05:04,495 --> 00:05:07,430
Sending your lackeys to do your stalking
for you. That is really pathetic.

80
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:12,525
All right, fine. I'm not proud of it,
but it's... it's Buffy.

81
00:05:14,672 --> 00:05:17,971
How many you got on her?

82
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:21,203
Just the one. But he got spotted.

83
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:24,838
Called me from the hospital
after he regained consciousness.

84
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:28,179
- You should've had more
of your people watching her.
- Yeah.

85
00:05:31,388 --> 00:05:34,016
- We'll be landing soon.
- [Sighs]

86
00:05:34,124 --> 00:05:37,719

- Like it were yesterday.

<i>- Ciao.</i>
<i>- Ciao.</i>

- Wait a minute. I wasn't in Italy in the '50s.

89
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:48,270
Oh, right. Guess you weren't.
Really missed out.

90
00:05:48,372 --> 00:05:51,637
Guess so. Sounds a lot better
than when I remember it.

91
00:05:51,742 --> 00:05:56,372

The Immortal thinks
he can do this to us.

No, actually, he was. Three hundred
years ago, and now he's back.

an unusual level of strength...

161
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:02,077
- What thing?
- [Chuckles] Cultural misunderstanding.

162
00:11:02,185 --> 00:11:05,814
Let us speak of more pleasant times.
[Continues In Italian]

163
00:11:05,922 --> 00:11:09,881
I part my threshold.
I mean, my apartment...

164
00:11:09,993 --> 00:11:12,018
obviously.

165
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:20,202
So, um, I had plans
later this evening...

166
00:11:20,303 --> 00:11:22,601
<i>but I could change them</i>
<i>if you guys wanna hang.</i>

167
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:27,599
<i>I could show you Rome at night.</i>
<i>A city of contrasts.</i>

168
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:31,044
- Anywhere you wanna go.
Anything you wanna see.
- [Together] Buffy.

169
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:34,117
Right, because you two both...

170
00:11:34,217 --> 00:11:37,550
- Yeah. She's not here.
- Where'd she go?

171
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:39,986
- To meet the Immortal.
- By herself?

172
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,957
- I told you I had plans.
- When did she leave?

173
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,620
- Just missed her.
- Then we're not too late.

174
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:47,720
- Of course, it could be worse.
<i>- You're telling me.</i>

175
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:50,129
Most nights,
they never leave the house.

176
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:53,430
Just curl up on the couch and snuggle.

177
00:11:54,938 --> 00:11:59,568
- They're snuggling?
- For starters.

178
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:04,942
Wait. Uh, you didn't know
they were together?

179
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:08,074
It's worse.

180
00:12:16,793 --> 00:12:19,023
Darla. Darla. Darla.

181
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:22,360
- What have they done? My sweet death.
- [Sighs]

182
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:25,697
Angelus, you're back.

183
00:12:25,802 --> 00:12:28,930
I'd claw my way back from the depths
of hell to lay by your side.

184
00:12:31,374 --> 00:12:35,003
- [Spits] He's tasted you.
- Who?

185
00:12:35,112 --> 00:12:38,980
- Who do you think?
- Oh, that cheeky bastard.

186
00:12:39,082 --> 00:12:40,845
<i>Had us tossed,</i>
<i>then violates your woman.</i>

187
00:12:40,951 --> 00:12:45,115
- Did he hurt you?
- Not until I asked him to.

188
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:51,554
Oh, come on. Have you seen him?

189
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:55,358
With the eyes and the chest...

190
00:12:55,465 --> 00:12:57,365
and the immortality.

191
00:12:57,467 --> 00:13:00,595
- We're immortal.
- Not like him.

192
00:13:00,704 --> 00:13:03,696
I mean, he's not some
common vampire. He's...

193
00:13:03,807 --> 00:13:06,173
I don't know what he is. A giant.

194
00:13:06,276 --> 00:13:10,576
A titan straddling good
and evil serving no master...

195
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,649
but his own considerable desires.

196
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,412
- Darla.
<i>- And spiritual.</i>

197
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,921
Did you know he spent 150 years
at a Tibetan monastery?

198
00:13:20,023 --> 00:13:22,583
Which I guess explains all the desire.

199
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:25,820
- He's my arch nemesis.
- Oh, darling.

200
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:28,557
It was just fornication.

201
00:13:30,534 --> 00:13:33,059
Really great fornication.

202
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,502
- She's glowing, mate.
- She isn't.

203
00:13:35,605 --> 00:13:38,574
- Little bit.
- Best fit you for a pair of antlers.

204
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:42,042
- Been made the right cuckold, you have.
- Time for another pony ride?

205
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:48,508
Son of a bitch!

206
00:13:48,618 --> 00:13:51,178
- The both of you?
- He is insatiable.

207
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:54,348
Drusilla, you let him touch you?

208
00:13:54,457 --> 00:13:59,019
- He felt like sunshine.
- No. No.

209
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,030
- That's why he had us tossed.
So he could violate...
- He didn't...

210
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,226
- Violate our women!
- Violate in succession!

211
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:07,599
- Concurrently.
- Concurrently?

212
00:14:07,704 --> 00:14:10,138
You never let us do that.

213
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,076
Come on, Dru. Let's have a bath
so the boys can weep in private.

214
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:19,808
- Will you hold me under the water?
- If you wish.

215
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,645
Mmm.
[Giggles]

216
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:27,490
This is a slight that will not go unmet.

217
00:14:27,591 --> 00:14:31,891
- Death's too quick.
- Not all deaths are quick.

218
00:14:31,995 --> 00:14:35,624
- What do you have in mind?
- I think it's time the Immortal
found out who he's dealing with.

219
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:38,758
I think it's time for blood vengeance.

220
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:41,496
Blood vengeance.
Look, I'm sure we're on the list.

221
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:43,664
Is there anything under blood vengeance?

222
00:14:45,508 --> 00:14:48,568
<i>No. No blood vengeance. Sorry.</i>

223
00:14:48,678 --> 00:14:52,512
- Maybe it's under Angelus.
- You are not on the Immortal's list.

224
00:14:52,616 --> 00:14:55,449
You know what?
To hell with the list.

225
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,419
You're not in here.
You're not going in there. Piss off!

226
00:15:00,523 --> 00:15:02,821
He mocks us at every turn.

227
00:15:02,926 --> 00:15:06,384
The man has no sense of indecency.
You remember Frankfurt?

228
00:15:06,496 --> 00:15:10,455
He hatches the Rathruhn egg personally
and then just decides
to give those nuns safe passage.

229
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:13,365
- Those were <i>my</i> nuns.
- Yeah, nuns are your thing.

230
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,928
Everybody knows that.
They respect it. They respect us.

231
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,807
We are the reason men fear the night.
This isn't over yet, Immortal! This'll never be over!

232
00:15:21,911 --> 00:15:25,711
It's over... just like that.

233
00:15:28,918 --> 00:15:32,877
- Not that I thought I had a chance anyway.
- At least I have a girlfriend.

234
00:15:32,989 --> 00:15:37,050
- Still.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

235
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:40,459
- The Immortal?
- I mean, come on.

236
00:15:40,563 --> 00:15:43,031
- She's smarter than that.
- She'd never fall for a centuries-old guy...

237
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:46,591
with a dark past who may
or may not be evil.

238
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:50,632
- She's under some kind of spell.
- I was thinking that.

239
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,708
We're gonna pick up the capo's body...

240
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:54,970
Find the Immortal
and break his whammy.

241
00:16:00,483 --> 00:16:02,542
<i>Grazie, Signor Angelo.</i>

242
00:16:02,652 --> 00:16:06,520
We are in your debt for
attending to a delicate matter.

243
00:16:06,623 --> 00:16:08,750
<i>Grazie. Grazie.</i>

244
00:16:08,858 --> 00:16:14,160
Um, this is the, uh, capo di famiglia of
the Goran demon clan?

245
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,165
Sí, sí. The capo di famiglia.

<i>- [Zipper Unzips]</i>

247

- This is just his head.
- Sí, sí. The head of capo di famiglia.

248
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:28,743
What happened to the rest of him?

249
00:16:28,845 --> 00:16:31,370
When a Goran demon becomes
heavy with the age...

250
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:35,178
his head sag and drop off like a ripe fig.

251
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,277
- So a new body just hatches out of this?
<i>- If the rituals...</i>

252
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:41,357
are performed by the family in time.

253
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:46,088
You must get the head of
the capo to Los Angeles <i>subito,</i> eh?

254
00:16:46,196 --> 00:16:47,788
- Sí?
<i>- Sí. Subito.</i>

- Yeah.

258
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:02,170
Gotta say, this is a step up from where
you boys used to hang your hats.

259
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:06,374
- Ooh, a couple of steps.
- Yes.

260

- Uh, you know, we didn't wanna say anything...

- Seemed a little rundown.

But Fred called it home,
so we just kept our mouths shut.

Hang on to the head. That's it.

322
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,678
- You were right there too.
- I wasn't in charge of the head.

323
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:38,747
Well, it's gone now, isn't it?

324
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,248
You gonna stand here in the <i>strada,</i>
yellin' at me all night?

325
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:45,616
- Did you just say <i>strada?</i>
- It means street.

326
00:22:45,722 --> 00:22:49,351
Yeah, I know what it means.

327
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:53,418
Look. We only have 12 hours
to get that head back...

328
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:55,793
before Los Angeles becomes
a demon war zone.

329
00:22:55,898 --> 00:22:57,923
Shall we argue some more,
or shall we get on with it?

330
00:22:58,034 --> 00:23:01,128
All right. You know, you're right.
No more screwing around.

331
00:23:01,237 --> 00:23:04,638
We find that guy, get the head back, then we
get the hell out of here. That's it.

- Have you seen the blonde girl?
- Buffy. Her name is Buffy.

333
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:10,079
- She was dancing with the Immortal.
- Did they leave?

334
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:12,670
- Relax, relax. It's okay.
- They're still here?

335
00:23:12,782 --> 00:23:15,512
Oh, no. They're gone.
But you must relax.

336
00:23:15,618 --> 00:23:18,755
- I pour you some wine.
- He's got her, Spike. He's got Buffy.

00:23:18,755 --> 00:23:19,585

- He's got her, Spike. He's got Buffy.

338
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,817
- Why is this always happening to us?
- It's him. The Immortal.

339
00:23:22,925 --> 00:23:26,884
This is what he does. Every time
he shows up, I either lose my girl...

340
00:23:26,996 --> 00:23:30,955
get beaten by an angry mob,
or get thrown in prison for tax evasion.

341
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:33,695
- Long story.
- Well, you know what? It's different now.

342
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:36,601
- We're different.
- Hey. Damn right we are.

343
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:39,334
- We're not gonna be his Shemps anymore.
- No way, man.

344
00:23:39,442 --> 00:23:41,342
We're just out of our element here.

345
00:23:41,444 --> 00:23:43,912
If this was L.A.,
we'd have him hog-tied by now.

346
00:23:44,013 --> 00:23:48,643

our helicopters, he'd be in a world of...

He considers them dirty.

Look, don't you guys have, like,
an Italian Wesley here?

Yes, yes. We have.
But he's taking a nap...

416
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:17,850
and I do not need him to tell me what is
already widely known.

417
00:28:17,953 --> 00:28:20,581
That the Immortal does not use magic.

418
00:28:20,689 --> 00:28:22,657
Then it must be something else.

419

You wore a necklace.

442
00:29:42,538 --> 00:29:45,166
You know, I helped kill

443
00:29:45,274 --> 00:29:48,402
Do those really count
as saving the world?

444
00:29:48,511 --> 00:29:50,706
I stopped Acathla.
That saved the world.

445
00:29:50,813 --> 00:29:53,247
Buffy ran you through with a sword.

446
00:29:53,349 --> 00:29:55,317
Yeah, but I made her do it.

447
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,047
I signaled her with my eyes.

448
00:30:00,156 --> 00:30:05,788

That one counts as mine.

449

We're better than this.

<i>Aw, she's just growing up, Mother.</i>

460
00:30:52,741 --> 00:30:55,437

Come here and give me a hug.

[Scoffs] I knew it.
None of this is a coincidence.

- You're just his lackey.
- I should be so lucky.

477
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:04,604
The Immortal does not need
a man like me to do his business.
