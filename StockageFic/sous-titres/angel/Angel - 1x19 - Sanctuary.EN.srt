1
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:15,580
Faith.

2
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,690
Come on.

3
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,320
It's okay.

4
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,579
Rest here.

5
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:05,099
You rest now.

6
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,209
I'll put your stuff here.

7
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:22,359
I'll be close.

8
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,780
Angel.

9
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:31,140
Yeah?

10
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,090
Nothing.

11
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,960
Bitch.

12
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:18,800
Not you, obviously.

13
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:23,449
I'm so sorry that
I allowed this to happen.

14
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,419
It was Faith who allowed her elbow
to collide with my face.

15
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,569
Not your fault.

16
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,770
At least you only got the elbow.

17
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:43,139
If it's any consolation, it looks like
you were tortured by a larger woman.

18
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:48,889
- She's still here, I assume.
- He gave her his bed.

19
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,050
- Wesley.
- Angel.

20
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:57,889
I didn't expect to see you in today.
How you feeling?

21
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:02,379
- As well as can be expected.
- Good.

22
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:06,729
Doughnuts?

23
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:13,039
Developed a sweet fang, have you?

24
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,650
- You got jelly?
- Whole selection.

25
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,129
Won't she find it difficult enjoying
delicious jelly doughnuts...

26
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,149
...if she is, one assumes,
bound and gagged?

27
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,269
- We already went through this.
- You were right.

28
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:35,199
The police are ill-equipped
to hold a slayer.

29
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:37,740
I see why you didn't turn her over.

30
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:42,500
But I don't see why the woman
who brutally tortured me last night...

31
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,439
...this morning, gets pastries!

32
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:50,029
I don't have anything else downstairs.

33
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:53,629
Do you want to let her starve?

34
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,329
There are more humane ways
to deal with a rabid animal.

35
00:04:57,769 --> 00:04:59,209
- She's not an animal.
- No?

36
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:02,899
She's a person. Don't forget,
we don't give up on people.

37
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,810
Don't take the moral high ground
with me after what she did.

38
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,810
I believe in helping people,
not coddling killers!

39
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:14,060
Not long ago you wanted
to rehabilitate her.

40
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:17,829
Not too long ago I had
full feeling in my right arm!

41
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:22,139
- She wants to change.
- There is evil in that girl, Angel.

42
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,750
It doesn't matter what she wants
or says she wants. She'll kill again.

43
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:40,319
- He'll come around.
- Wesley?

44
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:43,959
Sure! People always get
a little funny...

45
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:47,449
...right after they've been
sadistically tortured.

46
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,189
Well, you'd know.
I need you to sign these.

47
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,290
- You see why we have to help, right?
- Totally. Here.

48
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:00,470
We can't arbitrarily decide
who's worth saving.

49
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:02,839
Oh, I know! And this one?

50
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,569
Thanks.

51
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,600
- Wait, those were all made out to you.
- Yeah.

52
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:13,930
"Paid vacation"?

53
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:18,149
Like I'll stick around while
psycho case is loose downstairs...

54
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:22,250
...with three tons
of medieval weaponry? Not!

55
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,930
Oh, and I'm thinking:

56
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,600
Sugar high? Maybe not a great idea.

57
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,560
They gotta check in the back.

58
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:50,769
- See if the neighbors heard anything.
- Right.

59
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:04,389
- Kate. What are you doing here?
- I'm a detective, Kendrick.

60
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,220
See? I'm detecting.

61
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,519
- Heard we have a fugitive.
- Yeah.

62
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,220
Felony arrest warrant
from Sunnydale. I've seen it.

63
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:19,399
Is she the one
who threw the party here?

64
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:22,360
The victim identifies her
as his mugger.

65
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,360
Put him in the hospital,
stole his keys and wallet.

66
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:28,819
We're lifting prints now.
I bet we get a match.

67
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,069
Anything else?

68
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,139
Why are you examining a crime scene
you're not assigned to?

69
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,199
- It looked interesting.
- Right.

70
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,269
- You've heard the rumors.
- What?

71
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,970
You know, she supposedly
has some supernatural powers?

72
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:51,550
- Really?
- Come on, Kate.

73
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,060
Everyone knows you've gone all Scully.

74
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,860
Anytime we get a weird case,
you're there.

75
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,129
What's going on with you?

76
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,839
Scully is the skeptic.

77
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:04,009
Huh?

78
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,180
Mulder is the believer.
Scully is the skeptic.

79
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,420
- Scully is the chick, right?
- Yes.

80
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,230
- But she doesn't want to believe.
- And you want to believe?

81
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:18,759
Oh, I already believe.

82
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:21,410
That's the problem.

83
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,289
Faith?

84
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:50,570
I have doughnuts.

85
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,980
I understand what
you're going through...

86
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,120
...and I want to help.

87
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:09,759
But there are a few things
you must do.

88
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:11,850
First...

89
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:15,970
...I need you to give me that knife.

90
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,980
You should be resting.

91
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,710
I've been asleep for eight months.

92
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,580
You rest.

93
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:55,029
- We found her.
- Where?

94
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,710
- She's with him.
- Is he dead?

95
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,009
Well, he is a vampire.
So technically, yes, he is dead.

96
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,809
But not by her hand.

97
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:07,100
- She is his house guest.
- What?

98
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:12,070
Our assassin hasn't done her job
because she's rooming with the mark.

99
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,710
- We hired her to kill him.
- I did say "assassin."

100
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,779
- He invites her to stay the night.
- He's not easy.

101
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:23,399
He can't be bought. He can't
be killed, even by a vampire slayer.

102
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,200
- Rumor has it he used to date one.
- Who else knows about this?

103
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:31,519
No one outside of this room.
Not yet anyway.

104
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:34,240
The senior partners won't like it.

105
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,169
We conspired with her,
paid her half up front...

106
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,850
...and now she makes us
look like fools.

107
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:45,070
So the question is,
how are we gonna fix it?

108
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,230
I say we kill her.

109
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,240
Faith, no!

110
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:02,149
- You killed a man,
- I don't care,

111
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,070
Faith.

112
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:16,769
You're in no condition to leave.

113
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:20,429
If you go, you'll run
for the rest of your short life.

114
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,919
- It doesn't matter.
- It does matter. It matters to me.

115
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,409
Why are you doing this?
Why are you being nice?

116
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:30,539
Stop it.

117
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:34,570
You gonna move or do we fight?

118
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,029
- Am I your prisoner here?
- No. You're not.

119
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,549
- So I'm free.
- Don't know about that.

120
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:46,100
But the door's open.

121
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,710
Where will you go?
Back out in that darkness?

122
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:57,100
I once told you that you didn't
have to go out in that darkness.

123
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,850
That it was your choice.
Well, you chose.

124
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:09,279
You thought that you could
just touch it. That you'd be okay.

125
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:13,169
Five by five, right, Faith?

126
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,250
But it swallowed you whole.

127
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,830
So tell me:

128
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,899
How'd you like it?

129
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,799
Help me?

130
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:36,779
Yeah.

131
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:12,570
Hello, Wesley.

132
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,399
So, Los Angeles.

133
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:31,000
California.

134
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,940
Who knew you'd end up here?

135
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:39,220
It was as good a place as any
to re-evaluate my life...

136
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,639
...after being asked to resign
from the Council.

137
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:46,769
And the weather. I find it...

138
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,600
...dry.

139
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,629
They wouldn't give you dosh
for the fare home?

140
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:54,190
No, they wouldn't.

141
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,379
Alchemists on the board of directors,
and we still fly coach.

142
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:00,889
Miserly bastards.

143
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:04,330
A frugal lot, to be sure,
but not stupid.

144
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,029
And willing to admit
they've made a mistake.

145
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,570
- Made a mistake?
- How would you like to come home?

146
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,210
- Back to England with us.
- Home?

147
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,720
The Council's willing to reinstate you
to your rightful position as Watcher.

148
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:26,409
It was a nasty business in Sunnydale,
but nobody blames you.

149
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:31,659
Really? I rather got the impression
they did when they sacked me.

150
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,379
As I said. Mistake.

151
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:40,700
One that can now be corrected
with your help.

152
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,629
We know where she is,
and we know you have access to her.

153
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:01,100
- No. I couldn't possibly.
- Loyalty to a vampire now, is it?

154
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:06,110
It's all right.
That's not why we're here.

155
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:12,500
A rogue slayer, Wesley. Far more
dangerous than any single vampire.

156
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:17,190
- Surely you understand that.
- All too well.

157
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:19,639
Then you'll help us?

158
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:23,720
Why come to me? You know where
she is. Take her yourselves.

159
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,850
You three are the best.
The Council's elite. The--

160
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,940
She cleaned your clocks, didn't she?

161
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:38,860
She's betrayed our calling,
the Council, you.

162
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,840
She has power and the willingness
to use that power for evil.

163
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:45,929
She must be stopped.

164
00:15:58,049 --> 00:16:00,049
So how does this work?

165
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,389
There's no simple answer to that.

166
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,330
I won't lie and say it'll be easy,
because it won't be.

167
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:14,299
You want to change. Doesn't mean
the world's ready for you to.

168
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,429
The truth is,
no matter how much you suffer...

169
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:22,309
...or how many good deeds you do
to make up for the past...

170
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,850
...you may never balance out
the cosmic scale.

171
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,549
I can promise that
you'll probably be haunted.

172
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,590
Maybe for the rest of your life.

173
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:36,470
So how does this work?

174
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,809
Power level, time, start.

175
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:53,019
- That popcorn gonna be enough for you?
- Yeah. I can live off the stuff.

176
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,889
- Tell Cordelia I'll pay her back.
- It belonged to Wesley.

177
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,570
- Maybe we just don't mention it, then.
- Maybe we do.

178
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:08,660
- Are you saying I gotta apologize?
- Think you can?

179
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,049
I don't know.

180
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:15,579
How do you say,
"Gee, sorry I tortured you"?

181
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:17,660
I'd leave off the "Gee."

182
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:21,289
And I think you have
to ask yourself; Are you?

183
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:23,980
- What?
- Sorry.

184
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:31,980
There are things you can't take back,
no matter how sorry you are.

185
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:37,240
- I've got experience in that area.
- You've done this for 100 years.

186
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,839
- I can't handle 10 minutes.
- So handle the next five.

187
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:44,240
- I don't think I can.
- Yes, you can.

188
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:48,039
- I hate that it hurts like this.
- It's supposed to hurt.

189
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,220
All that pain you caused
is coming back on you.

190
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:56,049
Feel it! Deal with it! Then maybe
you've got a shot at being free.

191
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:02,440
I gotta be the first slayer
in history sponsored by a vampire.

192
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,329
I've got experience in that area too.

193
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:10,839
Oh, God. "B." How will I ever
make things right with her?

194
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:13,319
This isn't about Buffy.

195
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,700
There was only one person
who tried to be my friend...

196
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,990
...who went out of her way
when I didn't deserve it...

197
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:25,130
...and I screwed her. Not to mention
her boyfriend. Only him, literally.

198
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,089
- Faith, we never actually--
- Not you. The new one.

199
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,819
Oh, my God.

200
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:41,240
- Angel, I'm so sorry. I--
- No. There.

201
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,640
You can say it.

202
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:46,180
That's good.

203
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,700
Good.

204
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:56,299
Thank you for coming down
on such short notice.

205
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,339
We can rely on your professionalism?

206
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:02,789
We've had trouble
with freelancers in the past.

207
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,130
Do you take cream?

208
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,710
No. All right.

209
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,890
Here's the target.

210
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,720
Don't let the picture fool you.
She's tougher than she looks.

211
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,559
We're not talking anything elaborate,
no slow or painful death.

212
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:24,529
- Well, some pain would be good.
- The point is, we want her dead.

213
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,900
Yes. Dead.

214
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:28,890
A lot.

215
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:33,079
Just so we're clear, we won't
put any of this down on paper.

216
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,640
This is strictly a handshake deal.

217
00:19:37,329 --> 00:19:41,119
Not that hands are necessary
for us to do business with you.

218
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,250
That was speciesist of me.
I apologize if I--

219
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:49,990
--offended you in any way.

220
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:03,539
Careful.
The sedative in that syringe...

221
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:08,299
...is powerful enough to bring down
a man twice your size or a slayer.

222
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,759
- How does it work?
- How do you think?

223
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,049
You jab her with it, don't you?

224
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:20,410
A little pressure on the flesh
and she'll feel it.

225
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,059
- You intend to take her alive?
- Yes.

226
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:26,230
She'll be out long enough
to take to England.

227
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,779
There, she'll begin
her rehabilitation.

228
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,160
The Council believes
she can be rehabilitated?

229
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:34,250
We have every confidence.

230
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:39,529
Signal us as soon as it's done,
and we'll take care of the rest.

231
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:44,240
Thanks.

232
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,829
I have some conditions of my own.

233
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:50,660
Just one, actually.

234
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,660
- Don't harm the vampire.
- Don't be a ponce!

235
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,269
You won't get any help from me.

236
00:20:56,529 --> 00:21:00,109
- We have no quarrel with the vampire.
- Other than him being one.

237
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,450
He's a special case.
He's reformed. He has a soul.

238
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:10,769
In point of fact, I've confronted
more evil, slain more--

239
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,640
--demons, done more good,
while working with Angel...

240
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:19,140
...than I ever did while
in the Council's employ.

241
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,740
- We'll make every effort.
- No. Not every effort.

242
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,740
No harm. I must have your word.

243
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,380
Done.

244
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:35,559
Where's the dough?

245
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:38,420
What'd you do with it?

246
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,569
--final round, We'll be right back,

247
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:44,799
Coming up next on the
Channel 3 News, local council--

248
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:56,380
Everything okay?

249
00:21:56,569 --> 00:22:00,220
It was scary for the four minutes
I was alone, but I survived.

250
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:08,829
left-fielder Drew will step
into the box, batting ,321 on the--

251
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:14,190
LAPD, in conjunction with
the Feds, are looking for this woman,

252
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,930
The felony suspect from
the California town of Sunnydale...

253
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:20,140
Faith?

254
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:22,740
...has fled to Los Angeles
in recent days,

255
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,759
- Witnesses identified her...
- What?

256
00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:29,579
...as involved in several assaults,
Police want your help in finding her,

257
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:33,470
It's okay. We knew about this.
Nothing's changed--

258
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:37,109
Anyone with any information
about this suspect...

259
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,359
...should call
law enforcement immediately,

260
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:44,940
Do not approach her, She's violent
and unpredictable, Any questions?

261
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:50,269
Listen to me. You're safe here.
You hear me? You're safe.

262
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:17,069
No.

263
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:27,619
Hey, hey. Shh. Hey.

264
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:31,960
Sit down. It's okay.

265
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,000
It's gonna be okay, all right?

266
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:36,650
All right.

267
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:53,579
Buffy.

268
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:57,069
- I didn't know you--
- What--?

269
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,039
How--

270
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:06,099
- What are you doing?
- She-- We were attacked.

271
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,210
"We"?

272
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:12,849
- You and....
- Faith.

273
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,589
You and Faith.

274
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:23,670
- It's not what you think.
- You think I can form a thought now?

275
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:26,829
Giles heard that...

276
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:30,180
...she tried to kill you.

277
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,089
That's true.

278
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:39,029
So you're punishing her
with a severe cuddling?

279
00:24:39,329 --> 00:24:43,049
- Is that why you came? To punish her?
- I was worried about you.

280
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:47,720
Buffy.

281
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:52,519
Oh, God.

282
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,450
- Didn't think I'd find you, did you?
- Let's talk.

283
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:03,990
- Talking isn't in order now.
- She needs help.

284
00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:07,549
- You have any idea what she did to me?
- Yes.

285
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,460
Do you care?

286
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:16,900
- She wants to change, a chance to--
- No. No chance. Jail.

287
00:25:18,329 --> 00:25:20,150
- You think that'll help?
- Buffy.

288
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:25,119
- I'm sor--
- Apologize and I'll beat you to death.

289
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,250
- Go ahead.
- This is not gonna happen.

290
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:31,839
You'll have to stop me.

291
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,019
- Don't do this.
- Go upstairs now.

292
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:35,900
- You think I'll--
- Back off.

293
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:38,750
- I'm not letting her out of my sight.
- Go!

294
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,519
Don't you move a--

295
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:48,779
I'm sorry.

296
00:25:51,329 --> 00:25:52,519
I'm sorry.

297
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,599
Faith.

298
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,700
- Going somewhere?
- No. Just wanted to be alone.

299
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,259
Angel downstairs?

300
00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:16,099
Yeah.

301
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,980
Right.

302
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,140
- Well?
- Strike two.

303
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:36,279
Ridiculous. The first assassin
kills the second one...

304
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,220
...sent to kill her,
who assassinated no one...

305
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,410
...until we hired the second assassin
to assassinate her.

306
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,640
- Okay. This obviously isn't working.
- You think?

307
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,309
- We've gone about this wrong.
- Meaning?

308
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,839
As lawyers, it's a mistake
to work outside the law.

309
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,450
- He's being ironic.
- Not at all.

310
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:03,240
It's time we moved this fight to
our own turf. I'll take care of it.

311
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,500
- She's not gonna run.
- Why would she...

312
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:11,789
...when she has her brave knight
to protect her? Got you.

313
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:16,730
Does she cry?
Pouty lips, heaving bosom?

314
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:22,269
- I thought you needed help.
- You think I wanted this to happen?

315
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:25,140
You hit me.

316
00:27:25,289 --> 00:27:27,990
Not to go all schoolyard,
but you hit me first.

317
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,630
In case you forgot,
you're stronger than me.

318
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,569
You did it for her.

319
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,180
You were three seconds
from making her run.

320
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,180
- She's at a crucial stage.
- She's playing you.

321
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,940
- She tried to kill you!
- That was just...

322
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,019
- ...a cry for help.
- No, that's when you say "help" aloud.

323
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,279
- She did bad things to you.
- You've no idea.

324
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:52,279
You've no idea
what she's going through.

325
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,559
But, of course, you do.

326
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:59,750
I'm sorry. I can't be in your club.
I've never murdered anybody.

327
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,349
- Faith, I told you--
- Slight change of plan.

328
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,210
- Get your coat.
- What's going on?

329
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,789
The Council's team is coming.
They'll expect her to be drugged.

330
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,920
- How many?
- Three.

331
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,680
- I'm afraid you came at a bad time.
- I'm feeling that.

332
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:20,480
- Why'd you bring them?
- I pretended to help.

333
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:22,980
- Why aren't you?
- They're killers.

334
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:27,109
- They've surrounded the building.
- We'll go through the sewers.

335
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,920
- She left.
- She'd head for the roof.

336
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:34,029
- Buffy can protect her.
- That's not her agenda.

337
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:37,480
- The sewer's our best route.
- If they don't know about it.

338
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,630
- It wasn't for her.
- I know.

339
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,470
It's because I trust you.

340
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:46,200
More than three gun-toting
maniacs, at any rate.

341
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:52,859
Why should I listen to you? I despise
you and everything you represent.

342
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,410
And when I say "represent"
and "thing," I do mean your clients.

343
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:03,660
Be that as it may, I have information
that will be of interest to you.

344
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,839
While it's true
we differ on many issues...

345
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:12,019
- ...we do have one thing in common.
- Our bodies are both 80% water?

346
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:16,690
An enemy.

347
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,680
- I don't know--
- Sure you don't.

348
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:27,269
We can't be clear because the law
isn't clear on such matters.

349
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:31,470
Take for example the creatures
that murdered your father.

350
00:29:35,089 --> 00:29:39,269
They couldn't have been brought
to justice, even if they had lived.

351
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:43,259
And personally, I feel that
you were totally justified...

352
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:48,509
...in taking whatever extralegal
measures that you found necessary.

353
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,349
- What do you want?
- There are beings.

354
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:59,069
Beings not governed by the laws
and strictures we humans have devised.

355
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,779
This man is such a being.
He feels he's above the law.

356
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:07,609
Which is why he gives aid
and comfort to a known murderer.

357
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,549
The woman you're looking for?

358
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:15,920
She's with him.

359
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:29,250
You're not gonna run, Faith.

360
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:35,349
What do you want to do?
You gonna throw me off the roof again?

361
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,890
Any reason why I shouldn't?

362
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:45,730
There's nothing I can do for you, "B."
I can't ever make it right.

363
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:51,200
So you're gonna take off, let us
clean up another one of your messes.

364
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,960
It'd be easier for you.

365
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:58,049
Till you get bored with guilt
and come back to shake things up?

366
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:02,420
- That's not gonna happen.
- You're right. It's not.

367
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:07,299
Angel said you wouldn't
give me a chance.

368
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,990
I gave you every chance! I tried so
hard to help you, and you spat on me.

369
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:17,069
My life was just something
for you to play with.

370
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,299
Angel, Riley...

371
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:23,039
...anything that you could
take from me, you took.

372
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,990
I've lost battles before...

373
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:30,309
...but nobody else has ever
made me a victim.

374
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,359
You can't stand that.
You're all about control.

375
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:40,079
You have no idea what it's like where
nothing's in control or makes sense!

376
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:44,779
There's just pain and hate
and nothing you do means anything--

377
00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:46,269
Shut up!

378
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,740
Just tell me how to make it better.

379
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,569
That's coming from the roof.

380
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:06,559
- I didn't give you the signal.
- Shut it.

381
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,740
Vampire.

382
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:12,730
We can make it to the other building.
Go.

383
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:47,920
- Weatherby, listen to reason.
- Reason?

384
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:51,170
A Watcher working for a vampire.
It's perversion.

385
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:55,890
I must take this guy out. The guy
up there'll go for me. Stay here.

386
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,920
Okay.

387
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,089
Keep her steady!

388
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:08,960
Weatherby.

389
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:12,980
Do the sacred oaths you swore
as a Watcher mean nothing to you?

390
00:33:14,089 --> 00:33:17,670
As a matter of fact they do.
I swore to protect the innocent.

391
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:19,799
- Get to the roof.
- What?

392
00:33:20,089 --> 00:33:22,119
- Now!
- Bastard!

393
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,369
One hundred and eighty.

394
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,109
That's for calling me a ponce.

395
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,389
Down! Take it down.

396
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,420
Faith?

397
00:35:04,489 --> 00:35:05,650
Where is she?

398
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:10,690
You got one shot here, Angel.
Where is she?

399
00:35:12,889 --> 00:35:16,119
Arrest him. Start with
aiding and abetting a felon.

400
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:37,789
You'll like your cell. It faces east
and has a great view of the sunrise.

401
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:41,289
- What? You know what he is.
- Who are you?

402
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,900
- She's nobody.
- Wait. This is murder.

403
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:45,849
- It's okay.
- It's not.

404
00:35:45,889 --> 00:35:49,300
- Get her out of here!
- You are not taking the fall for her.

405
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,170
Buffy.

406
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,650
I'd like to make a confession.

407
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:27,679
You should've told me
what was going on.

408
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:31,909
I didn't-- I didn't think
it was your business.

409
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:37,099
- Not my business?
- I needed more time with Faith--

410
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:38,800
You needed--

411
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:44,260
Do you have any idea what it was like
for me to see you with her?

412
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,219
- You went behind my back.
- It wasn't about you!

413
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:53,110
It was about saving a soul. That's
what I do and you're not a part of it.

414
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,639
It was your idea
to stay away from each other.

415
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:02,119
- I came because you were in danger.
- I'm always in danger.

416
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,630
You came for vengeance.

417
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,380
- I have a right to it.
- Not in my city.

418
00:37:17,489 --> 00:37:19,699
I have someone in my life now...

419
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:24,260
...that I love.

420
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:29,079
It's not what you and I had.
It's very new.

421
00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:34,070
You know what makes it new?

422
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:36,929
I trust him.

423
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,000
I know him.

424
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:47,300
That's great. It's nice.

425
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,119
You moved on. I can't.

426
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:54,389
You found someone new.
I'm not allowed to, remember?

427
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:58,019
Seeing you cuts me up.
The person I share that with is me!

428
00:37:58,889 --> 00:38:00,500
You don't know me anymore.

429
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,949
Don't come here and expect me
to do things your way.

430
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:06,610
Go home!

431
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,280
See?

432
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:25,070
Faith wins again.

433
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,070
Go.

434
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:48,219
You all right?

435
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:53,679
For a taciturn, shadowy guy,
I got a big mouth.

436
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:57,949
- Do you want to go after her?
- Yes.

437
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:04,380
I don't know how much
my opinion counts but...

438
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:07,280
- ...you did the right thing.
- Yelling at Buffy?

439
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:09,820
No. The other thing.

440
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:12,610
I didn't do it.

441
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:15,219
Faith did,

442
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:19,170
I hope she's strong enough to make it,

443
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:22,139
Peace is not an easy thing to find,

444
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:26,690
She has a chance,
