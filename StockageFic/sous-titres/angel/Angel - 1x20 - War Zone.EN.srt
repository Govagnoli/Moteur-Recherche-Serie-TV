1
00:00:58,329 --> 00:00:59,310
You.

2
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,459
You expecting somebody else?

3
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:21,150
- I've missed that smell.
- Camembert, I believe.

4
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:25,289
What? No, money.

5
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,539
I like to smell a little money once
in a while.

6
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:32,590
She's not kidding. Hide some
and watch her. It's uncanny.

7
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:34,400
There he is.

8
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,020
- Mr. Nabbit, hi!
- Oh, hi.

9
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:52,680
- Glad you could come.
- Thanks.

10
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:55,069
- Thanks for having us.
- It's a pleasure.

11
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:57,550
Who are you?

12
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:02,310
I'm Cordelia Chase.
We spoke on the phone.

13
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:05,979
Oh, right. So, you must be Angel?

14
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,539
Nice to meet you. This is Wesley.

15
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,159
- Lovely party.
- Isn't it nice?

16
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:15,900
Oh, my God, is that Welling Harding?

17
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,810
I have no idea. I don't
know most of these people.

18
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:25,919
I don't even talk to the people.

19
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:28,639
They come and I think they have fun.

20
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:31,289
- These are crab.
- If it's a bad time....

21
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:35,340
Miss Chase said that
you could only meet at night.

22
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,379
It's more convenient.

23
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:41,310
And we'd be less
conspicuous during the party.

24
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:46,879
I think it's good.
We won't be interrupted.

25
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,560
I always said I'd make a billion
dollars in the software market...

26
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:55,360
...and learn to talk to girls.

27
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:00,370
I'm still working on 2,

28
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,520
Tell us about your case.

29
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,310
My case.

30
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,370
It somewhat has to do with blackmail.

31
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:16,500
- Go on.
- Familiar with Dungeons and Dragons?

32
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,949
I've seen a few.

33
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,540
- The role-playing game?
- Oh. Game.

34
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:24,439
Right.

35
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:28,100
I used to play a lot in high
school. It's cool.

36
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:33,329
You get to be someone else.
A wizard, warrior. World is magic.

37
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,699
Fighting troglodytes
and romancing demon princesses.

38
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:39,939
It's a rush.

39
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,069
Did someone find out you
were a nerd?

40
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,220
No, that's public record.

41
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:51,779
But some of us got really into it.

42
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,220
Especially the demon-romance part.

43
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,870
And then we heard
about this place where the real....

44
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:05,689
- We joked about getting tail.
- You went to Madam Dorion's.

45
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,529
Just once.

46
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:11,730
- It's a demon brothel.
- Or twice.

47
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,470
In Bel Air, I believe.
There are many stories about it.

48
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,370
- And how many...
- Twelve times.

49
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:22,420
- ...people knew about you going?
- Just my friends.

50
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:27,509
My security guys already
identified the guy with...

51
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,490
...the pictures.
Lenny Edwards. I can't find him.

52
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:35,800
We'll see if we can do better.

53
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:39,230
If my stockholders
see these pictures--

54
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:42,680
- They won't.
- Don't worry. We're discreet.

55
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,759
We'll mingle here for a few hours,
so no one suspects.

56
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:51,120
Hey, David.
Nice to see you.

57
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,750
Nice seeing you again. Yeah.

58
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,300
I have no idea.

59
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,949
When I moved here
I thought it was all glamour...

60
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:04,670
...but there's an unseen world.

61
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:06,439
More than one.

62
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,600
Got him!

63
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,860
Bobby! Bobby!

64
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:13,860
No, no, no!

65
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:16,860
- Dog him.
- Gunn, come on.

66
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,480
Go!

67
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,459
- They're back!
- Open up!

68
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,670
Keep a look out.

69
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:33,800
Let's get him inside. Come on.

70
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,980
It's gonna be all right.

71
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:51,170
Get them in.

72
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:13,110
I got you.
Just a couple more steps.

73
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,009
You're gonna make it.

74
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,779
Three more.

75
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:19,750
All right. Here we go.

76
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,329
Easy, easy.

77
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,980
Yeah. There we go.

78
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:29,129
- Hey, Gunn.
- Right here, man.

79
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,200
He picked me up like I was a baby.

80
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:35,840
He's dust, Bobby, forget about him.

81
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:39,480
- I'm not a baby.
- He needs a doctor.

82
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,980
Not anymore.

83
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:53,460
James?

84
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,889
How are we fixed for tonight?

85
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:00,580
We took canned food.
Wasn't much behind Mel's.

86
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:03,759
We got that. I told
them we don't take squatters.

87
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:06,240
Everybody eats.

88
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:09,230
Okay, you guys are lucky.

89
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,340
We don't do vampires. Sorry.

90
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,220
- I just came to talk.
- Sorry.

91
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,159
You know Lenny Edwards?

92
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,409
- If I did, I won't tell.
- Discreet, good.

93
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,720
It's essential.

94
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:50,379
Is it discreet for a client to
be photographed here...

95
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,509
...and then blackmailed?

96
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:55,330
- What?
- Bad for business, I guess.

97
00:09:56,049 --> 00:10:00,620
If I can find Lenny Edwards, maybe I
can stop it before word gets out.

98
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:04,889
- Who's the girl?
- Not sure. The client's David Nabbit.

99
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,929
Lina!

100
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,289
Talk to Lina.

101
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,919
- He's a pretty one.
- He's a vampire, Lina.

102
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,210
Really? We can make an exception.

103
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:26,740
Just don't do that face thing,
and we'll get along great.

104
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:31,370
Look, Ma, no hands!

105
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,769
That's not why he's here, Lina.

106
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:42,809
I'm looking for him.

107
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:49,750
Your boss wants you to cooperate.

108
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,820
Vampires.

109
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,220
Seen my brother?

110
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,850
- Gunn, we need to talk.
- What up?

111
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,259
- What happened to Bobby?
- Not that. That's done.

112
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:19,860
- We're dying, Gunn.
- Everybody dies.

113
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:22,610
I'm making sure that
when we die we stay dead.

114
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,649
It shouldn't have happened.
You're reckless.

115
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:29,000
- I do what I have to.
- You do more than that.

116
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:33,580
Three weeks and no teeth. You had
to ring the dinner bell like that?

117
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,049
You couldn't go
another day without death.

118
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,850
- I like this?
- You love it.

119
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,809
You won't be happy until you're dead.

120
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,309
- You're wrong.
- Well, I hope so.

121
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,139
Because I don't want to lose you too.

122
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,730
Not gonna happen, little sister.

123
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:01,789
All right? It's never gonna happen.

124
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:06,379
Chain! You found them?

125
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,220
He led me right to it.
It's close, right around the corner.

126
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:14,070
- Nice.
- Next to the blue jean factory.

127
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,720
Now we can do some real damage.

128
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:19,580
Incoming! Moving fast.
Rooftop to rooftop.

129
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:22,090
- You were followed?
- No.

130
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,639
Let's check it out.

131
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:39,129
- What do you want?
- Big question. What do I want?

132
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,919
Love, family, a place
I can call my own, but you know what?

133
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:50,350
- What?
- I'll never have any of those things.

134
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,009
Unless things go the way I want
them to, neither are you.

135
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,269
- Where's pictures of David Nabbit?
- Don't know him.

136
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,379
You only get one lie.
I should have told you.

137
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,419
Look, pal, you're
obviously not from around here.

138
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,679
But trust me, you do not
want to see my bad side.

139
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:20,740
You show me yours, I'll show you mine.

140
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,009
Now I'm from around here.
I'm taking over, understand?

141
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:30,019
I will dog you every night
until you bring me what I want.

142
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,049
Are we clear?

143
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:33,519
Yeah, okay. See you tomorrow.

144
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:44,070
- Vampire is moving in.
- Yeah, he ain't gonna stay too long.

145
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,970
This should take care
of your expenses to date.

146
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:55,970
I appreciate what
you did at the party.

147
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,899
At the party?

148
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,830
What we did at the party?

149
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:06,340
- It was a wonderful party.
- We had a good time. It meant a lot.

150
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:10,470
You were paying us to be there.

151
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:14,029
I do that all the time.
You guys actually hung with me.

152
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,259
I'm in charge of the....

153
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,820
- I think there must be some mistake.
- I think Mr. Nabbit can write a check.

154
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,809
No mistake. I believe
in rewarding good work.

155
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:35,070
This is generous, Mr. Nabbit,
but we're not finished yet.

156
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:39,929
It's only money. And it's David.
You guys call me David, okay?

157
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:44,740
I like David.
It's such a masculine name.

158
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,110
It feels good in your mouth.

159
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:52,470
Well, David.
You won't be disappointed.

160
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:56,309
We'll earn every cent of
your confidence in our firm.

161
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,759
- Bye.
- Bye.

162
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:01,789
- Feels good in your mouth?
- I was flustered.

163
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,850
- You're a sneaky son of a bitch.
- You have the photos?

164
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,399
Yes. And a little something extra.

165
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:23,399
Love that.

166
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,059
Whatever he pays you isn't enough.

167
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,659
Get him!

168
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,909
Come on! Speed up!

169
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:36,849
Alonna! Don't shoot.

170
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,210
- What are you playing at?
- We're not playing.

171
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,470
- You'll get killed.
- You first.

172
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:47,859
Let's dust him.

173
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,250
For some reason, I think you
don't like me too much.

174
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,019
Maybe I'm just overreacting.

175
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,869
You pretend you're
different from them?

176
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,589
Yeah. I'll pretend I
just saved her life.

177
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:24,240
You put a lot of work into this.
Some clever stuff.

178
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,180
I'm impressed.
I have a few suggestions.

179
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,650
- We're not interested.
- Yeah.

180
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:31,910
You should be.

181
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:35,579
Who do you think that would've killed?

182
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:38,680
- We're on the same side.
- Same side of what?

183
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:41,079
I didn't come here to kill you.

184
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,140
It don't matter why you're here,
or what you are.

185
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,190
If you come here again,
don't count on any long goodbyes.

186
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:16,359
Nice work. Nabbit will be greatly
relieved to get these back.

187
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:21,099
Oh, my.

188
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,539
It's upside down.

189
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:29,970
Not something you'd have framed.

190
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,849
- How does it feel?
- I can't imagine it's pleasant.

191
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:36,809
I'm talking to Angel.

192
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:39,589
Oh, right. Sorry.

193
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,329
It feels--

194
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:43,900
It feels better.

195
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:53,420
- You should rest. You look--
- Like I've been beaten and stabbed?

196
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:58,750
- Want to see the check again?
- I want to find those homeless kids.

197
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:01,190
- They're living together.
- How many?

198
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:05,029
Six, seven, maybe more.
A couple weren't older than 16.

199
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,539
Twenty minutes' ride from billionaires
and crab puffs, kids going to war.

200
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:14,490
This isn't something new.
They've been pushed to this.

201
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:19,710
I understand their stake-first-
ask-questions-later state of mind.

202
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:22,579
It's how they survive.

203
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:26,319
And the idea of a vampire
in a white hat...

204
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,950
...probably seems a little
give-me-a-breaky.

205
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:32,289
They're gonna get killed.

206
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,289
There has to be a nest in the area.

207
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,710
- Find out where the kids live.
- Consider it done.

208
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,000
I'll find the nest before they do.

209
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:46,609
He'll have to be close, probably
a 10-block area.

210
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:49,440
It'll have to have sewer access.

211
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:56,390
Can I see that check again?

212
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,299
Street trash.

213
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,589
That's what they are.
Just stupid, human street trash.

214
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:08,180
For 70 years we ruled
this neighborhood.

215
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,650
It was our neighborhood.

216
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,859
Decent people used to
live here, working people.

217
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:19,539
And now? You can't even finish one
without wanting to puke!

218
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:28,319
And whose fault is it? Theirs?
I don't think so.

219
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,140
It's our fault. We let this happen.

220
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,710
We got lazy. We dropped our guard.

221
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:42,829
Ty, you ever been
lured into an ambush before?

222
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,740
Of course not.

223
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:48,910
Ty's been around for as long as me.

224
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:53,029
He's survived, like me,
because he's smart.

225
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,750
But they did this to him...

226
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,450
...and that means that they could
do it to any one of us.

227
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:02,819
And why?

228
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:08,740
Because this street trash
ain't afraid to go for the heart.

229
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:18,380
And now that's what we're gonna do.

230
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:21,059
No more picking them off one by one.

231
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:26,140
We concentrate on the heart.
Take the heart and the rest will fall.

232
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:29,829
I can't hear it.

233
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:32,609
- He could be useful.
- Don't listen to her.

234
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,140
There's something different about him.
He knows things we don't.

235
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,960
- He didn't have to do it.
- He would've died.

236
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:41,960
- Maybe.
- No "maybe." We'd have killed him.

237
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,549
- Guy bugs me.
- Everyone bugs you.

238
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,269
- You bug me the most.
- What?

239
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,519
I'm trying to keep you alive.
Don't trust him.

240
00:22:52,529 --> 00:22:55,509
If he's not looking
to kill, what's he want?

241
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,549
Why would he come
to a place like this?

242
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:34,799
Where are they?

243
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,289
- I got some food.
- I'm not hungry.

244
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:46,700
When did you eat last?

245
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,160
Seems like just yesterday.

246
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:51,069
- Poe went shopping.
- Alone?

247
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,430
Jason had his back. They were fine.

248
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:57,630
- Like last time?
- No cops, no chase.

249
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,390
Come on, you eat this.

250
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:03,000
They got some other stuff.

251
00:24:03,329 --> 00:24:06,700
Hamburger, and some apples
and lots of other stuff.

252
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,420
We'll have a home-cooked meal.

253
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,089
- What?
- Get everybody out.

254
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,569
- What is it?
- Just do it, go!

255
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,140
Come on, everybody!
Get up! Get up!

256
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:25,900
- Get everybody into the daylight.
- Don't they have to be invited?

257
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,390
Chain!

258
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,009
- Cops?
- I don't know.

259
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,900
Are they in? Where are they?

260
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,430
Go, go, go!

261
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:42,069
I don't see nothing.

262
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:45,529
- There is nothing.
- Oh, God.

263
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,599
Alonna!

264
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:17,859
Gunn! Gunn!

265
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:39,509
You know? There's nothing like riding
in a convertible with the top down...

266
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:43,819
...to make you see the sun and sand.

267
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,859
- Smell that salt air?
- That's not salt.

268
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,670
I don't think it's air either.
But reality's a choice.

269
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:57,099
You see what you see
and I'll see what I see.

270
00:25:59,089 --> 00:26:01,259
A man in an alley
pushing a shopping cart.

271
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:06,059
- I see a tan lifeguard-type with--
- No, over there.

272
00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:13,650
These kids have electricity
in their building.

273
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:16,900
Maybe they tapped a power line
and run it illegally.

274
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:20,529
If I find the tap, it will
tell us where they are.

275
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:24,480
Ask this guy if he's seen
our young vampire killers.

276
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,359
I'll check for any taps.

277
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,710
You ask and I'll check for taps?

278
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,559
You can imagine him as
a buff, young stud...

279
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,519
...while I am stuck
with the naked truth.

280
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,359
Ask me in.

281
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,349
You'll get a lot of people killed.

282
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:01,730
I suck, okay?

283
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,380
- You don't want to be here.
- They want you to go.

284
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:09,630
I don't need advice
from some dude that's dead.

285
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,190
You have no idea what it's like
down here.

286
00:27:14,089 --> 00:27:16,650
Some of you will die.
Maybe all of you.

287
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,250
People die all the time,
some just for talking too much.

288
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,089
- We're done.
- I can help.

289
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:32,920
Unless you want to die,
then you're on your own.

290
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,599
- I'm always on my own.
- You don't have to be.

291
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:40,589
Why not do this together?

292
00:27:44,089 --> 00:27:45,559
You figure it out.

293
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,740
Let's go.

294
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,559
Hold up. Give me 10 minutes
to check it out.

295
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:10,690
If you're not back in 10?

296
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:14,000
Come on down and
kill anything that moves.

297
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,920
Alonna?

298
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,190
Hey, big brother.

299
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:25,579
- What took you so long?
- Oh, God.

300
00:29:26,089 --> 00:29:27,170
You're not...

301
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:31,940
...dead.

302
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:32,890
Well....

303
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,059
No.

304
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,700
Don't be sad. I'm not.

305
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,710
- They killed you.
- Do I look dead?

306
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:47,109
I'm stronger, faster
and better than ever.

307
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:50,960
Want to see?

308
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:31,279
Right track, but the wrong team.

309
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,769
All that rage and hatred we got?
We'll keep it...

310
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:39,710
...except on this side
there's no guilt, no grief.

311
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,700
Just the hunt and the kill
and the fun.

312
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,450
How often did we go out
during the day?

313
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:48,930
Alonna, I can't do this.

314
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,819
You were made for this.

315
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,380
All that misery and moping, gone.

316
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,230
I wasn't gonna let
you get hurt.

317
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,200
I protected you.
You were my sister.

318
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:03,720
I still am.

319
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,849
So why don't you kill me?

320
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,359
Why don't you?

321
00:31:14,529 --> 00:31:15,970
You can't!

322
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:18,890
You got the guilt.
I got the best guilt cure.

323
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:23,049
I can free you.
Our family can stay together...

324
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,990
...forever.

325
00:31:40,329 --> 00:31:41,839
Trying to open that?

326
00:31:43,329 --> 00:31:46,000
- They locked you in?
- No, I love meat lockers.

327
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:49,319
You should've tried
to call us on your cell phone.

328
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:54,119
You probably forgot you had it.

329
00:31:56,529 --> 00:31:58,210
Those things hardly ever work.

330
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,980
Besides, it was a lot easier
and quicker to just....

331
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:06,779
Look, I'm the boss here. I make
the calls, and I have to go.

332
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:10,039
You're welcome!

333
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,519
Remember when we were kids in
that shelter on Plummer Street?

334
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,869
Second floor was all rotted out.

335
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:26,930
You used to dare kids to cross, and of
course you were the best at it...

336
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,609
...because you were the bravest.

337
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:37,059
I wanted to be like you so bad, so I
went up, and the floor gave out.

338
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:43,029
I would have broken my neck, but
you'd been watching me the whole time.

339
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:48,390
You were standing below,
and you caught me.

340
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,230
You've always been
looking out for me.

341
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,680
You don't have to anymore.
It's my turn to look out for you now.

342
00:33:01,329 --> 00:33:02,980
- How?
- Look at you.

343
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,819
You're running, hiding, cold
and hungry. Is that living?

344
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:14,549
You're the one falling now.
Let me catch you.

345
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,589
Don't you want to stop falling?

346
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,240
I'm gonna fix it.

347
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,549
Say goodbye to
everything you ever knew.

348
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:36,759
Goodbye.

349
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:47,549
Let's get out of here.

350
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:54,569
What are you waiting on?
How did he get out?

351
00:33:55,289 --> 00:33:57,319
Yo, don't. We're leaving.

352
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,480
- Leaving?
- I don't think so.

353
00:34:07,289 --> 00:34:10,840
She was so sweet, your sister.

354
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:14,469
So smooth going down.
If you know what I mean.

355
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,340
You wanted a war? Well, this is it.

356
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,039
- Here is the deal: You can go.
- What?

357
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:28,170
If you go now, and I
never see any of you again...

358
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:31,030
...you get to live.

359
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:32,760
Are you high?

360
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:35,829
L.A. is mine, you'll want
to stay out of it.

361
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:39,289
These kids, my town,
off-limits from now on.

362
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:46,239
Who the hell are you?
You know who I am, fool?

363
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:48,010
The name's Angelus.

364
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,309
I wasn't actually talking to you.

365
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:56,190
Do we have a truce?
Or do you want to die?

366
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,690
Truce? We can take them.

367
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,230
They'll take some of you.

368
00:35:10,289 --> 00:35:13,840
You came all this way, you're not
gonna kill any vamps?

369
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:17,519
I already did.

370
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:52,039
I asked for a coffee. I know
it must be in here someplace.

371
00:35:55,409 --> 00:35:57,940
Are you all right?
You haven't said a word.

372
00:35:58,409 --> 00:36:00,940
I was just thinking about those kids.

373
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,730
Yes. That place was pretty awful.

374
00:36:04,409 --> 00:36:06,579
And I thought my
first apartment was bad.

375
00:36:07,409 --> 00:36:09,829
Can you believe
people live there?

376
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:16,670
It certainly gives one a sense of
perspective, doesn't it?

377
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:21,579
It does. And I think,
perspectively speaking...

378
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:26,909
...I might want to prostitute
myself to billionaire David Nabbit.

379
00:36:28,409 --> 00:36:29,110
Cordelia.

380
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:34,280
What I mean is, he's a nice
guy who wants companionship.

381
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,269
I could use some security.

382
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:40,920
- So when I say "prostitute," I mean--
- Prostitute.

383
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:44,659
- For instance.
- Do you think you could?

384
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:49,110
I don't know. I could
probably learn to love him.

385
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,730
Looks aren't everything, or chemistry.

386
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:58,780
Personality, that's important.
That makes up for a lot of other....

387
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:04,780
It's not what's
on the outside that....

388
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:09,480
Yeah. Never mind.

389
00:37:10,409 --> 00:37:11,989
I'm fine here.

390
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:15,019
Poor, alone.

391
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:38,309
- What you doing here?
- Skulking, professionally.

392
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:45,510
I'm glad for what you did, okay?
But I don't need no guardian angel.

393
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:48,510
It's not gonna change things.

394
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:51,510
They'll keep coming,
and we'll keep fighting.

395
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,199
I know.

396
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:01,179
That's it? You ain't gonna talk
at me, be our daddy figure?

397
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:05,659
What can I tell you
that you haven't already learned?

398
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,619
- I killed her.
- You didn't.

399
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,550
Near enough.

400
00:38:19,409 --> 00:38:21,369
She was the reason, man.

401
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:29,730
How come you do it?
How come you're out here?

402
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,929
What else are we gonna do?

403
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:39,199
- I'll be around.
- I don't need no help.

404
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:41,920
I might.
