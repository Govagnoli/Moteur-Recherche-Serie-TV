1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:02,939
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:07,379
I've done things, questionable things.
You're all fired.

3
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:09,300
Officer, wait!

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,039
- What are you?
- A vampire.

5
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:20,629
It's called a moment
of clarity, You've just had one,

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,640
You might not be able to fix this.

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,789
- Angel.
- You okay?

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,350
No.

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,390
Sorry.
I wanna work for you.

10
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:31,929
How do we know we can trust you?

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,670
This won't be easy, Angel,

12
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,390
You have to change your behavior,

13
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:45,759
Engage your coworkers. Be sensitive
to their feelings and opinions.

14
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,219
Especially before you
take some action...

15
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,329
...one might construe as--
Let's say, insane.

16
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,350
It goes a long way to show you
appreciate and respect them.

17
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,020
- This is torture, isn't it?
- Yes.

18
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:01,829
Good.

19
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,120
That's all.

20
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,680
I'll just, you know,
sit and absorb it all.

21
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,019
Somewhere else. Not here.
I mean, this is...

22
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,700
...your office now.

23
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,010
I'll just-- I'll get out of your hair.

24
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,730
- You're sure about this?
- Absolutely.

25
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,480
I work for you. I just need to--

26
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,549
I've provided you
with a new working space.

27
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,819
- Great.
- And I'd love a cup of coffee.

28
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,900
That's very funny.

29
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,579
Two sugars in mine.

30
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:45,769
Mocha cappuccino here.

31
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,180
Man, atonement's a bitch.

32
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,189
- Don't.
- Don't?

33
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:37,060
You're gonna try to make
small talk, get all stammery.

34
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,800
You might strain yourself.

35
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,930
Just wanted to know how you were.

36
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,000
I mean, we really haven't
had a chance--

37
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,490
- Let me--
- It's okay.

38
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,500
- I can--
- I've got it.

39
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:55,849
Okay.

40
00:03:57,729 --> 00:03:59,340
You want to know how I am?

41
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,159
Tired, mostly, with sweaty
running a close second.

42
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:07,210
I'm also jazzed.

43
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,030
Can't wait to start business again.

44
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,439
Ready to help the helpless.

45
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,009
But just so we understand each other,
you and I...

46
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,269
...we're not friends.

47
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,930
Wesley!

48
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,009
She's screaming.
Pulling her from a car.

49
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:54,379
Guys in blue robes.

50
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,459
They're...

51
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,329
...taking people and--

52
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,279
Whoa.

53
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:07,529
- Big bird.
- Big Bird?

54
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:09,000
Not the Muppet, dumbass.

55
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:12,389
Where's the car, Cordelia?

56
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:15,920
Lafayette Park, the fountain.

57
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,120
Right. Let's move.

58
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:19,910
- Are you--?
- Fine.

59
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,990
You should take off.

60
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:27,769
I mean, the rest of the night.
Go home.

61
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:32,790
Order Chinese.

62
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,350
Hello?

63
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,199
Hello?

64
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,860
That's how you greet a friend?

65
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:13,339
Harmony? Harmony, I don't believe it!

66
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,800
- Yes. It's me.
- I haven't seen you since--

67
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,399
- Our school blew up.
- Seems like a lifetime ago.

68
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:22,629
Oh, for me too. Totally.

69
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:25,730
Wow. Look at you.

70
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:27,750
You look...

71
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:29,269
...different.

72
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:32,720
I'm not the same as I was
back at Sunnydale High.

73
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:36,250
And you. You...

74
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:38,769
...cut your hair.

75
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:40,449
Oh. Yeah.

76
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,839
I think it looks adorable,
off your neck.

77
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:48,629
Thanks. I was just, you know,
looking for a change.

78
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:52,129
Sure. Change. Change is good.

79
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:53,939
Sometimes.

80
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,300
So, this is where you do...

81
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,540
...whatever it is you do?

82
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,589
- Detective agency.
- Right. But you're not a detective.

83
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:06,819
Well, not me.

84
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,850
Technically. I'm--

85
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,110
Mostly I manage things. The office.

86
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,509
Sounds rewarding.

87
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,620
Are you in town on business?

88
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,050
No. No business.

89
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,889
Play, play, play.

90
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,810
I just got out of
a smothering relationship.

91
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:34,379
You know when they
can't live without you?

92
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,430
Sure. That one.

93
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,959
Hate that.

94
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:43,800
I thought it would be a good time
to check out L.A.

95
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,290
See old friends.

96
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,569
- Got a place to stay?
- You offering?

97
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,759
- Do I have to say it?
- Yeah.

98
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,000
Stay with me. Hope you
don't mind the couch.

99
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,649
Now what?

100
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,839
Gunn, search the area
near the fountain.

101
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,279
I'll take this path. Angel--

102
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,350
Follow the screaming woman?

103
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,779
Why you wanna hide
such a pretty face?

104
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,899
It's over now. You'll be safe here.

105
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,509
Didn't Cordelia say blue robes?

106
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:50,590
Perhaps she was wrong.

107
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,879
I think we should give her
the benefit of the doubt, don't you?

108
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,779
I'll check. See if those
blue boys are still around.

109
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:06,850
- Religious sect?
- I don't know.

110
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:08,940
I'll put Cordelia onto it.

111
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:13,200
- I gave her the night off.
- Did you?

112
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,899
Well, I thought, you know,
she looked so tired--

113
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,879
The vision got to her.

114
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,039
Do you think I should send
her something? Like flowers?

115
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,879
- Flowers?
- Yeah.

116
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,110
To say, "Thanks.
I'm sorry about the migraines."

117
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,009
You know, "I appreciate you."

118
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:37,590
Yes. And while you're at it,
pick me up one of those...

119
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:40,350
..."Sorry you were shot in the gut"
bouquets.

120
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,700
Right. Sorry.

121
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,940
You can't buy back her trust, Angel.

122
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,809
Or her affections.

123
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,279
She said--

124
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,980
She said we're not friends.

125
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,740
I know.

126
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,159
There's only one thing you can
give her, Angel. That's time.

127
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:09,500
She has a lot of pain.

128
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,750
Oh, your cackle.

129
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,580
And then, remember...

130
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:19,769
...in ninth grade remedial Spanish,
Donnie something?

131
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:22,000
Donnie Wray. Yes.

132
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:26,090
That's him! He followed me everywhere.

133
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:29,549
Oh, and he wrote that
love song to you.

134
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:31,070
How did it go?

135
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:35,830
Oh, Cordelia

136
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:39,889
How I long to feel ya

137
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,909
Oh, God. We totally ruled.

138
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:50,309
Yeah. That we did.

139
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:52,559
We were powerful...

140
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,490
...rich, popular.

141
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:58,840
None of that's changed for me.

142
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:03,220
Apart from the powerful,
rich and popular.

143
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:07,129
- But I am happier now than I was then.
- Get out.

144
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,940
It's hard to explain.
I'm telling you, it's like--

145
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:14,299
I had these air pockets inside of me.

146
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:17,580
And the work I'm doing--

147
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:22,690
We're doing, it's like
the pockets keep getting filled...

148
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,600
...and I'm becoming me and--

149
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,169
Me has had way too much to drink.

150
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,399
And me shut up.

151
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,590
You, now. You've barely
told me anything.

152
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:41,690
Well, what can I say?

153
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:44,899
Things are fabu. I'm having a ball.

154
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:48,990
I did just get out of that
really unhealthy relationship.

155
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,370
And just, you know, feeling
really good about me in general.

156
00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:58,350
Well, good for you.

157
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,220
In general.

158
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,899
Well, you must be doing something
right, because you look...

159
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:08,059
...crampy.

160
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:10,110
Are you okay?

161
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,539
Yeah, just...

162
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,350
...hungry, I guess.

163
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,980
Got the cure for that.

164
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,870
Pizza.

165
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,889
I know just the place. My favorite.

166
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,210
Thin crust. Heavy on the sauce.

167
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,100
Do you like pineapple
and tandoori chicken?

168
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,169
Oh, yeah. It's all good.

169
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,679
I didn't do that.

170
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,409
Harmony?

171
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:34,509
I have a ghost.

172
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,179
- What are--?
- Nothing.

173
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,440
Harmony?

174
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:44,950
I'm sorry. I thought
I could control myself.

175
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:50,210
- I thought I could resist my urges.
- Urges?

176
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:54,509
You have no idea how hard it is
to stay away from you.

177
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,149
I mean, seeing you there, looking so...

178
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,860
...luscious.

179
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:07,889
- Oh, you're a--
- I should have told you.

180
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,039
I was scared.

181
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,110
Scared that if you found out
what I was, you'd kill me.

182
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:19,220
Oh, no. Harmony.

183
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,190
You really think
I'm that narrow-minded?

184
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:24,519
I don't care about that.

185
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:29,070
- You don't?
- No. Not as long as you're happy.

186
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,710
Happy. What's that?

187
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,970
The last time I was happy
was back in school with you.

188
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,659
- Now, I'm taking advantage of you.
- No.

189
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,519
It's just--

190
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,179
It's just that I had no idea
that you...

191
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,600
- ...thought of me that way.
- I don't, I swear. It's just--

192
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:58,259
Well, I haven't had any
for a while--

193
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,690
Forget it.

194
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:05,559
This is stupid. I'll just
go back to the couch.

195
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,419
I'm really sorry.

196
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:11,809
Don't be. If you wanna
stay and talk--

197
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,830
No, I better--

198
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,419
You know, I'd appreciate it if you
didn't mention this to anyone.

199
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,149
It's our secret.

200
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:28,179
How come you didn't tell me
about Harmony?

201
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:31,389
You couldn't afford
a little phone call?

202
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,330
Harmony?

203
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,620
What about Harmony?

204
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:38,590
She's here, in L.A.

205
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,539
Yikes. Big yikes. What happened?
Did she come after you?

206
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:47,509
Yeah. She practically attacked me
in my bedroom last night.

207
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,909
- Your bedroom?
- While I was sleeping,

208
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,240
Good thing I woke up too. She was
ready to jump me right there.

209
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,360
But I think she understood me
when I shot her down.

210
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:02,980
- You wounded her?
- She'll survive.

211
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,940
I shouldn't have invited her to stay.

212
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,009
- Say what?
- Yeah, I know. Awkward much?

213
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,360
Cordelia!

214
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,940
We're all clear on the fact
that Harmony's a vampire, right?

215
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,779
Harmony's a vampire?

216
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,759
That's why--

217
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,090
Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.

218
00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:31,029
All this time I thought she was
a great big lesbo.

219
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:35,129
Oh, yeah?

220
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,009
Really?

221
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,669
Well, that's great. Good for you.

222
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,440
Thanks for affirming.

223
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:47,019
Cordelia, Harmony's very dangerous.
You have to get out of there.

224
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,100
I'll call when I get somewhere safe.

225
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,250
Where are you going?

226
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,429
Maybe I can find the manufacturer.

227
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,259
Already looked into it.
No listing anywhere.

228
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,120
Maybe I'll find something
on the street.

229
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,569
The street bathed in morning sunlight?

230
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:09,720
Relax. Gunn's contacting his sources.

231
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,549
- Well, what can I do?
- Answer that.

232
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,329
Angel Invest--

233
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,809
Willow?

234
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,529
Willow, what--?

235
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,539
Slow down. Hold on.

236
00:17:29,529 --> 00:17:31,039
Get away from her...

237
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:32,910
...foot.

238
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,230
- What are you doing?
- We're--

239
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:36,970
Willow called and told us.

240
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:40,279
- Your friend Harmony is a--
- Vampire. I know.

241
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,039
- An evil vampire.
- Yeah, we covered that too.

242
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:51,130
You thought you'd kill her...

243
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,039
...without giving her a chance
to explain herself?

244
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:56,700
- Pretty much.
- That's it.

245
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,319
Holster your guns, boys.
She came to me for help.

246
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:04,529
That's what we do, right? Help?

247
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:09,920
That thing may have your friend's
memories, her appearances...

248
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,839
...but it's a filthy demon,
an unholy monster.

249
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,029
- No offense.
- About what?

250
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,309
Wes, you can't.

251
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:22,920
Cordelia feels her friend
isn't a threat.

252
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:25,809
I think we should respect her wishes.

253
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:31,039
I'm just saying.

254
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,589
Cordelia, we need you.

255
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:40,069
Let me get my coat.

256
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:46,589
So you're just going to
leave her here?

257
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,910
A vampire, risking your
neighbors' lives?

258
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:54,009
Harmony's my friend,
and I trust her completely.

259
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,960
Harmony can stay.

260
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:58,920
I don't wanna be alone with the ghost.

261
00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:03,839
Triangles evoke
pyramidal imagery...

262
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:08,319
...but there's nothing with both
a serpent and a pyramid.

263
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:13,160
Doesn't appear to be--
Do you mind?

264
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:17,990
Well, I'm kind of bored, but go ahead.

265
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,849
The red bird sculpture you saw--

266
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:24,130
Was it an eagle? A hawk? A falcon?

267
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:26,359
Am I the Bird Lady of Alcatraz?

268
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:31,150
It had wings and a beak. For all
I know, it was a big red duck.

269
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:35,529
Perhaps it's an idol, a totem
the cult uses in its rituals for--

270
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,779
Duck worshippers?

271
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,980
It could be a landmark
at their hiding place.

272
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:46,119
I'm unaware of any bird
statuary in downtown L.A.

273
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,140
So unless you are--

274
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:50,430
Put a stake through her heart...

275
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,930
...if she persists in popping gum!

276
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:55,160
Harmony, lose the gum.

277
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:59,140
Sorry. I thought it would
help with the cravings.

278
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,680
You'd think I'd get thanked
for not biting any of you.

279
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:08,740
What are you doing?
This book is 12 centuries old!

280
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,990
It's not like I messed up a new one.

281
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,690
She didn't do it on purpose.

282
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:18,349
That's right.

283
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:21,480
And I could have
because, you know, I am evil.

284
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:25,579
Wesley! Wesley!

285
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:27,349
There's blood in here.

286
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:29,920
Let's get you some
and let everyone work.

287
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,930
Here you go. That's it.

288
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,200
Drink up.

289
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,079
Tastes funky.

290
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:42,980
It's pig's blood.

291
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,559
That's gonna go
straight to my hips.

292
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,039
- How can you?
- You get used to it.

293
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:52,789
I mean, how do you stand everything?

294
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:57,789
Being what you are. How can you
deprive yourself of the taste?

295
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:02,559
The sensation of rich,
warm, human blood...

296
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:07,750
...flowing into your mouth?
Bathing your tongue...

297
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:11,849
...caressing your throat
with its sweet, sticky--

298
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:13,619
- I'm back.
- Me too.

299
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,150
I see we have company.

300
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:26,640
That's Harmony. She's visiting.

301
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,450
It's okay to speak freely
in front of her. She's a vampire.

302
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:36,980
- Don't we kill them?
- What did you find?

303
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,980
Robed vampires been getting
people for a month.

304
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:43,960
- Why didn't we know?
- We've been distracted lately.

305
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,559
Or we haven't heard because
the bodies aren't turning up.

306
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,240
They're turning them.

307
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,039
Into vampires?

308
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:55,119
They're building an army.

309
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:57,660
Question is, for what?

310
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:01,640
The time is here.

311
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,859
The time is now.

312
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,349
The question is, are you ready?

313
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,930
I said, are you ready?!

314
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:13,349
It's time. Take a seat.

315
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:17,900
It's time to actualize your potential.

316
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,450
Time to maximize your input...

317
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,259
...and get the most
out of your afterlife.

318
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,839
To those of you who are new,
I wanna say:

319
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,609
Hi.

320
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,160
You're special.

321
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:36,890
You each have it in you
to be the best vampire.

322
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:40,279
Not just any vampire, but a master.

323
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,069
How? I'll show you.

324
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:47,339
Through my personally devised
multi-level...

325
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:50,170
...exponential flow co-operative.

326
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:54,960
I know what some of you are saying,
"Hey, Doug, speak English, man."

327
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,250
Okay, don't stake me, guys, all right?

328
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:01,529
Here's how it works.

329
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:06,220
One vampire turns two humans
into vampires.

330
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,599
They each turn two more humans.

331
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,210
And they turn two more.

332
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,259
And so on, and so on.

333
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:19,630
All it takes for each vampire
to buy their way...

334
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:23,480
...into our co-op is one human,
to be deposited...

335
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,509
...in our very own food bank.

336
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:32,799
How about that, huh?

337
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:36,150
You turn two into vampires...

338
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,700
...and you bring one
for the food bank.

339
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,500
Turn two, and the rest is food.
Say it.

340
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:45,369
Turn two, the rest is food.

341
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,519
Turn two, the rest is food!

342
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,049
Next.

343
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:52,490
Two students grabbed in a parking
garage on Figueroa.

344
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,900
Got it. Next.

345
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,809
- Guy snatched two blocks over.
- When was this?

346
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:02,130
Last night. Heard it
from one of my guys.

347
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:06,509
- What?
- Nothing. Just--

348
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:09,220
I can't believe this
is what you do.

349
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:13,000
We always said we'd do
something cool. Look at us.

350
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,089
You work here, I'm dead.

351
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:18,329
Life takes some funny turns sometimes.

352
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,559
I'm not where I thought I'd be,
but still--

353
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:26,339
Hey. Hello, guys?
Found something.

354
00:24:26,849 --> 00:24:28,880
There's nothing mystical
about it.

355
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:33,400
Department of Justice.
A logo for a defunct pyramid scheme.

356
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:36,049
Vamps running money scams now?

357
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:40,240
This particular one was run
by a motivational speaker and--

358
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:44,440
Oh, Lord, help me,
self-described "Life Coach"...

359
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:46,920
...named Doug Sanders.

360
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:50,480
Held meetings until
the feds caught him.

361
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:54,109
- He was arrested?
- He disappeared. Still at large.

362
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,569
- Has the makings of a cult leader.
- Here's something.

363
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,329
His known meeting sites.

364
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,450
- A picture!
- Now we're talking.

365
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,099
Let me see.

366
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:11,099
Okay, that was my fault.

367
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,619
Get her out of here.

368
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:14,099
Now.

369
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:16,180
Come on, Harm.

370
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,069
Such a fitting nickname.

371
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:21,970
Bloody hell.

372
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,799
This was a mistake.
I shouldn't have come.

373
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,519
I'm just getting in the way.

374
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:32,519
- Don't talk like that.
- Easy for you to say.

375
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,309
You've got friends.

376
00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:38,690
I don't have anyone
who understands me.

377
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:46,599
I know someone who understands
a little about pain.

378
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,779
We're going out!

379
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,849
Memories

380
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:07,529
May be beautiful and yet

381
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,940
What's too painful to remember

382
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,500
So, what do you think?

383
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,569
Your friend should reconsider
the name Harmony.

384
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:34,710
The way we were

385
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,750
The way we were

386
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:52,569
That was so fun!
I can't believe I did that.

387
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:55,049
Color us incredulous.

388
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,519
Harmony's looking for guidance.

389
00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:00,859
I'm picking up on the
"Gotta find my corner of the sky"...

390
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,990
...vibe loud and clear.

391
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:04,789
- You can help?
- No.

392
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:09,059
But I can treat you
to a carafe of plasma.

393
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:12,269
AB-negative here is superb.
Or so I'm told.

394
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,109
That's it?

395
00:27:14,329 --> 00:27:17,279
You were supposed to do
some mojo. Show me my path.

396
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,930
You're on it, my cacophony.

397
00:27:20,329 --> 00:27:23,660
I'm not your travel agent
for this trip. Brown eyes is.

398
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:27,940
Stick with her.
Let your pal be your guide.

399
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:32,000
Cacophony. That's pretty.

400
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:34,859
What's it mean?

401
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,109
Cordy!

402
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:45,759
I see you have other concerns
at the moment, but we need you.

403
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,519
- Why?
- The attacks are in a 10-block area.

404
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,059
The cult must be around there.

405
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:55,039
We'll drive around the area.
Maybe you'll see something.

406
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,500
- Like a red bird.
- For instance.

407
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:00,799
Okay.

408
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,750
Harmony, I have to go.
Work stuff. You okay here?

409
00:28:05,329 --> 00:28:07,930
You kidding? Free blood, potato skins.

410
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:11,140
Hey, I'm thinking about
doing another number.

411
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:14,180
Do you think,
"Candle in the Wind"...

412
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:16,750
...or the Princess Di
"Candle in the Wind"?

413
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:19,900
Go nuts. Do both.

414
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:24,650
Okay. Like the green guy said,
you're my guide.

415
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:30,690
So we're on the same page,
when we find this cult...

416
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,809
...we kill them.

417
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:34,509
Let's do it.

418
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,779
- Harmony?
- I got it. He said stick with you.

419
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:53,099
- I understand where my place is.
- Where?

420
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,730
With you.
I'm one of the good guys now.

421
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,740
This is gonna be great.
I am an evil-fighter.

422
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,799
I suck at being evil because
I'm meant to fight it.

423
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:23,349
It's so clear now. Is this what
it feels like to have purpose?

424
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:25,160
I mean, wow!

425
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:29,599
Look at us, we're working together.
I never had a job before.

426
00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:32,359
We can gossip at the water cooler.

427
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:35,150
Harm, I'm trying to concentrate.

428
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:37,450
Oh. Sorry.

429
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:41,220
How long have you been fighting evil?

430
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:44,369
I just started, but I got some moves.

431
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,269
- Angel!
- You have to tell her.

432
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,990
She won't listen to me.

433
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,549
Welcome to my world.

434
00:29:51,049 --> 00:29:52,519
That would be so funny.

435
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:56,220
- Oh, do we get paid vacations?
- Stop!

436
00:29:57,049 --> 00:29:58,059
Pull over here!

437
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,579
- Is that--?
- I don't--

438
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:10,210
I'm not sure.

439
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:18,640
The bird you saw was red.

440
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,109
It is. I mean, it was.

441
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:24,140
- Looks like puke green.
- Not like a duck.

442
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,400
There's something familiar.

443
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:29,049
We passed this place before.

444
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:31,380
Cordelia?

445
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,450
No. No, I guess it isn't it.

446
00:30:34,849 --> 00:30:35,789
Right.

447
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:37,349
In the car. We'll--

448
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:38,900
Where's Angel?

449
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:46,839
Forgot to turn on the lights.

450
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,450
- I told you this was it.
- Right.

451
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,130
Angel and Cordelia, cover the front.

452
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,349
We'll see if there's another way in.

453
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,509
What about me? What's my job?

454
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,190
- Guard the car.
- You got it.

455
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:08,009
Anyone comes near,
I'll rip his throat out.

456
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,609
No. No killing.

457
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,210
- Okay, maiming only.
- No!

458
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:15,420
Yell louder, they didn't hear us.

459
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,480
Go. I'll talk to her.

460
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,450
Touching. With the hands.

461
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,609
You know, I've tried not
to say anything.

462
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:29,539
I tried to let things
sort themselves out.

463
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:32,299
But Harmony cannot work with us.

464
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:35,079
I know. It was just temporary.

465
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,359
Look. She loves this.
Gives her a reason to go on.

466
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:41,960
I don't want her going on.
Neither should you.

467
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,730
She's the enemy.

468
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:48,390
- You sound like Wesley.
- Because he's right.

469
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,930
Harmony will turn on you.

470
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,339
Why? Because you did?

471
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,519
- She's a vampire.
- So are you.

472
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,359
- She doesn't have a soul.
- That's it, is it?

473
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:05,579
- You're better because you do?
- Yeah.

474
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:09,250
Yours didn't stop you
from betraying us.

475
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,730
We cared about you.

476
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:13,910
And you didn't
just betray me, Angel.

477
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,779
You didn't just hurt me.
You gave away my clothes.

478
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,750
- To the needy.
- I am the needy.

479
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:26,180
I was afraid you were
becoming Angelus again.

480
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:30,380
Imagine what could have happened
if you'd slept with Darla.

481
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,210
You know I would never do that.

482
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,789
- No way to see inside.
- Or how many.

483
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:39,980
Okay, I'll go in, pretend I want
to join up, get a headcount.

484
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:43,730
Too many nightcrawlers know your face.

485
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,589
- Some can sense your soul.
- Right.

486
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,519
Harmony!

487
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,519
Yeah?

488
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:55,619
She doesn't have a soul.
Nobody knows her.

489
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,130
She can be a spy.
Tell us what's what.

490
00:32:58,849 --> 00:32:59,720
- Me?
- No way.

491
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:02,859
- I got a bad feeling.
- I know she can do it.

492
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,829
You can do this, right?

493
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:09,880
I kind of thought I'd start out
with light typing, car-guarding.

494
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:12,430
Something low pressure.

495
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,809
This is the chance you needed
to find a purpose.

496
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,710
But I thought I had purpose
guarding the--

497
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,519
Yeah.

498
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:27,740
Okay. I wanna do this.

499
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,799
All right, Harmony, you're on.

500
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,019
Watch out, evil.

501
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,019
Here comes Harmony.

502
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,440
Hey, we'll meet you out back.

503
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:49,230
You may be thinking, "I'm not
like you. I don't have what it takes."

504
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:53,960
That's just your inner human,
the neuroses of your past life.

505
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,539
Ignore it. Instead, say,
"I'm in control of my un-life."

506
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:04,190
A nice big hand for Tibor,
graduating to the yellow level.

507
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:13,480
Now, with each level ascension
there are rewards.

508
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:17,500
Grab yourself a nice juicy one.

509
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,599
Come on, let's hear it!

510
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,400
Let's hear it!

511
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:37,340
- She should be back.
- Maybe she's stuck.

512
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,070
Give her a minute.

513
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:43,090
- This was a bad idea.
- We can rescue her.

514
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:47,010
Now we're saving a vampire
from vampires? No way.

515
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,309
That is so-- Harmony!

516
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:54,280
- Are you okay?
- Fine. There's maybe 100 of them.

517
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:56,610
And a cage full of people.

518
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:59,119
You did it. You so rule!

519
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,760
I know! I left the
back door open. Come on.

520
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:06,280
I have to thank you again
for giving me this opportunity.

521
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,940
You could have totally staked me
in Cordelia's apartment.

522
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:15,659
And who would have blamed you?
One more vampire turned to dust.

523
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:20,250
But you helped me find my destiny.
I really appreciate it.

524
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:23,130
I've never belonged anywhere.

525
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,989
Yes, yes. You're welcome.

526
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:30,000
The vampires, where are they?

527
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:32,539
Oh, right behind you.

528
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,059
I belong with them.

529
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:57,960
That is an impressive display
of potential actualization.

530
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,710
A member of us for 20 minutes...

531
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:03,150
...and look what she's delivered.

532
00:36:03,409 --> 00:36:05,940
Two to turn, and one for food.

533
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,940
As a bonus, the infamous Angel.

534
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,329
Someone made the ascension
to blue robe.

535
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:17,659
- Oh, goody.
- Congratulations, Harmony.

536
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:22,309
Taking the first steps to mastering
my destiny. Like you said.

537
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:24,750
Well, Harmony...

538
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:28,630
...aren't you just the most
weak-willed, soft-brained--

539
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,460
Those comments are growth inhibitors.

540
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:34,280
I tune out mental roadblocks.

541
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:41,550
You can all put your weapons down now.

542
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:47,400
Really, Angel, you don't want
all your friends to die horribly.

543
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,690
No, I don't.

544
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,260
Wesley?

545
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:55,989
Kill them all!

546
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,539
- You okay?
- Yeah.

547
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,340
Get those people out.

548
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,739
It's all right, we'll get you out.

549
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:37,840
Why are you working with humans?
Maximize your potential.

550
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,420
Empower your vampire self.

551
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:57,039
- What's so funny?
- Your crossbow is aimed at my throat.

552
00:37:57,929 --> 00:38:00,070
You're stupid.
That won't kill me.

553
00:38:00,929 --> 00:38:04,409
No, it'll hurt like hell.
This is the one that'll kill you.

554
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,690
Okay, you're angry. I don't blame you.

555
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,710
Just, you know, it's nothing personal.

556
00:38:30,929 --> 00:38:32,440
I'm evil.

557
00:38:33,329 --> 00:38:35,190
We're still friends, right?

558
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,590
This way, quickly.

559
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,960
- We're still friends?
- No, we're not friends.

560
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:11,429
- Get out of here.
- Really?

561
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,420
Not just here.
I want you out of my city.

562
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,250
You'll want to be far away.

563
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:20,389
But I left a few things at the-- Bye.

564
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:30,739
Don't say anything. Not a word.

565
00:39:43,889 --> 00:39:48,389
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes. Please, come in. Close the door.

566
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:53,159
I just--

567
00:39:56,489 --> 00:39:59,329
I thought we'd meet
before Cordelia arrived.

568
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:04,059
I know things have been strained
between the two of you.

569
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:06,610
Working in such close quarters--

570
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,300
It's okay, Wesley, really.

571
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:13,760
She has a right to feel that way.
I'm willing to give her room.

572
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:16,849
Good.

573
00:40:17,489 --> 00:40:18,539
Good!

574
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:22,409
That's just the right attitude.
Time and space...

575
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:25,380
...are really the only things
one can give.

576
00:40:25,889 --> 00:40:28,659
As long as we understand that,
the healing--

577
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,860
Oh, my God, these are gorgeous!

578
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,440
You have the most amazing taste.

579
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:38,260
You have like a gay man's taste.

580
00:40:38,489 --> 00:40:42,840
That's saying something.
I love them so much!

581
00:40:43,889 --> 00:40:47,079
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
You're the best!

582
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:53,469
I have to go try these on.
La-la-la-la-la!

583
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,599
I have new clothes!

584
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:58,099
I have new clothes!

585
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:00,889
I got her clothes.

586
00:41:01,889 --> 00:41:03,400
New clothes!

587
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,300
New clothes, new clothes.

588
00:41:43,889 --> 00:41:45,639
Thank you, thank you very much,
