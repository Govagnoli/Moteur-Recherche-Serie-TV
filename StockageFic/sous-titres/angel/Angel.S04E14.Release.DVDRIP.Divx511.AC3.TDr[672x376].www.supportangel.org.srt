a chunk out of his cheese.

If you really think you did something
wrong, don't do it again. That simple.

- Fred, l...

I know. Whatever Wes was feeling,
whatever he thought might...

342
00:24:27,013 --> 00:24:30,449
I should have told him it was never
gonna happen. Think I don't know that?

- Who? Ow!

blood half the night in pissholes like this.

He was in here earlier...

...and then he started mumbling
to himself like a big, pretty freak.

You tried to take him, didn't you?

391
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:31,326
You attacked Angelus
inside the hotel...

by the anti-demon spell?

he was talking to someone else.

It was all "a rain of fire"
and "pulling strings" and "a soul."

00:35:59,173 --> 00:36:02,324
You really have gone soft now,
haven't you?

503
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,324
Hey!

504
00:36:04,613 --> 00:36:08,049
You remember that time you tried
to get Angel to kill you...

505
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:13,731
...because you felt all weepy
over being such a bad little girl?

506
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:17,128
Do you still feel that way?

507
00:36:17,493 --> 00:36:19,688
Do you still want to die?

508
00:36:21,133 --> 00:36:22,725
- No.
- What's that?

509
00:36:22,893 --> 00:36:24,121
- No.
- I can't hear you.

510
00:36:24,293 --> 00:36:25,851
No!

[GUN COCKING]

512
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:32,805
Too bad, because you're gonna.

513
00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:39,807
But not like this.

514
00:36:45,613 --> 00:36:47,569
Looks like we got a live one.

515
00:36:49,893 --> 00:36:51,246
For now.

516
00:36:55,853 --> 00:36:58,845
A little tired, sweetie?
Want to take a break?

517
00:37:06,693 --> 00:37:11,050
Now, this is disappointing.
You never used to bleed so easy.

518
00:37:11,213 --> 00:37:14,285
- Screw you!
- Maybe after.

519
00:37:14,773 --> 00:37:18,129
I like my girls to lie still.

520
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,332
Hey, buddy, how's it going in there?

521
00:37:27,213 --> 00:37:31,889
Good old Wes. Always count on him to
tackle a bad situation and make it worse.

522
00:37:32,453 --> 00:37:35,684
I mean, hey, look how you turned out.

523
00:37:37,093 --> 00:37:41,086
But then again, I guess he really
didn't have much to work with, now.

524

[LAUGHS]

525
00:37:43,493 --> 00:37:45,449
Save the head trip, GQ.

526
00:37:45,613 --> 00:37:48,173
Wes told me you'd try
to get under my skin.

527
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,722
Gave me just what I need
to scratch you out.

528
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:55,569
Oh, don't tell me. The rousing,
stiff-upper-lip speech.

529
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:58,691
Rah, rah! Good over evil!
Do what must be done!

530
00:37:58,853 --> 00:38:01,367
Hang in there, kitten,
it's almost Friday!

531
00:38:01,533 --> 00:38:04,445
Is that what the scraggly,
little ponce armed you with...

532
00:38:04,613 --> 00:38:08,288
...to fight the big, bad bogeyman?

533
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,762
Yeah. And this.

534
00:38:37,533 --> 00:38:39,649
ANGEL:
That hurt, baby.

535
00:38:39,813 --> 00:38:41,849
I kind of liked it.

[LAUGHING]

537
00:38:45,293 --> 00:38:48,524
How about you? There's my girl.

538
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:52,163
Knew she was in there somewhere,
dying to come out and play again.

539
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:54,324
- Shut up.
- I know how it feels.

540
00:38:54,493 --> 00:38:58,486
Forced to be someone you're not.
Hurts to the bone.

541
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:03,966
You try to bury the pain, but you can't
get the hole deep enough, can you?

542
00:39:04,813 --> 00:39:08,283
No matter how much you dig,
it's still there.

543
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:18,085
Broken shards stabbing every time
you breathe, cutting you up inside.

544
00:39:18,253 --> 00:39:22,166
You know, there's only one way
to make the pain stop.

545
00:39:23,013 --> 00:39:24,446
Hurt someone else.

546
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:59,893
Come on, Faith,
you're not even trying.

547
00:40:03,373 --> 00:40:05,284
Or is that why you really
came back, huh?

548
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:09,002
Not enough to punish yourself
in prison? Is that it?

549
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:11,482
Looking for someone
to beat the bad out of you?

550
00:40:13,693 --> 00:40:16,924
I could beat you to death,
but it wouldn't make a difference.

551
00:40:17,093 --> 00:40:20,051
Nothing will ever change
who you are, Faith.

552
00:40:20,693 --> 00:40:24,129
You're a murderer, an animal...

553
00:40:25,093 --> 00:40:26,082
...and you enjoy it.

554
00:40:27,613 --> 00:40:28,966
Just like me!

555
00:40:51,973 --> 00:40:53,201
No!

556
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:03,328
You're wrong. I'm different now.
I'm not like you.

557
00:41:07,573 --> 00:41:09,211
But you will be.
