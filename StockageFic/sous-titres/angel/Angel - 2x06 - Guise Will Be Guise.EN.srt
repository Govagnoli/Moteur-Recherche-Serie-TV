00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:02,799
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:05,450
So Wolfram & Hart brought you back.

3
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:09,080
- What's the plan?
- We want him dark, not dead.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,279
- Stop.
- You stop. God doesn't want you.

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:17,660
But I still do.

6
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,539
Hello.

7
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:49,770
Didn't hear you come in.
How can I help you?

8
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,399
Where is he?

9
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:55,659
Angel? He's out at the moment.
Is there something I can do?

10
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,969
- I'm his associate.
- Tell me where he is. It's urgent.

11
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:03,359
We specialize in urgent.
Life and death?

12
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:06,500
I need someone with his
special abilities.

13
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,760
I understand perfectly.
Why don't you fill me in--

14
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:15,430
What about you?
You got any special abilities?

15
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,040
A few, I dare say.

16
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,769
- You a creature of the night?
- No.

17
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,680
I was a rogue demon hunter...

18
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:28,659
...so I can handle myself
when things get rough.

19
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:31,599
Yeah, you're scary.

20
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,260
He'll be back soon.

21
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:39,579
If your boss
wants to run a business...

22
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,219
...he shouldn't foist clients off
on his secretary.

23
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,370
That's "associate."

24
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:56,590
What are you doing?

25
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:01,519
Knocking things over, driving away
business. The usual.

26
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,040
I found him, and we have to stop him.
We have to change--

27
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,319
You have any clothes a man would wear?

28
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,389
Don't make eye contact. Keep going.

29
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,349
- What are you doing?
- Risking our lives.

30
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,189
- How'd you get in?
- The door.

31
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,330
- They let you in?
- Hello. Lawyer.

32
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:03,240
- You're not going up there.
- I need to. I have to find her.

33
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,349
- Still Darla.
- You encourage him?

34
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,789
I'm just going along for the ride.

35
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,719
They have vampire detectors.

36
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,800
We know. He's got a plan.

37
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,719
- Plan?
- Get there before I'm stopped.

38
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,669
That's the plan? Walking
real quick was the plan?

39
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,569
Angel, you're insane, and angry...

40
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,389
...and insane. You need help.

41
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,250
I'm not insane or angry.

42
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,990
Man, that's nasty.

43
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,759
Maybe I am a little angry.

44
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,699
Maybe?

45
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,240
Okay, what I wanna know is...

46
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:46,420
...how did I not know about this
weird stuff?

47
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,180
It's weirder than you think.

48
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:52,069
The host, the one talking to Angel...

49
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:55,910
...he helps demons. Reads their souls,
senses their futures.

50
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,300
But he can only do it when
they sing karaoke.

51
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:04,769
I thought maybe I'd seen you walk away
for the last time. You okay?

52
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,720
Yeah.

53
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,730
Once more, with less feeling.

54
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:12,430
I guess I'm a little, um...

55
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,750
...rocky.

56
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,250
And Rocky II and half of the one
with Mr.T. Tell me about it.

57
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,420
I just--

58
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,899
I feel this--

59
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,220
Like I have to do something...

60
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,189
...and if I don't, I'll explode.

61
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:30,290
Then, when I do something,
it feels, uh....

62
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,670
I think maybe this...

63
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,410
...this is it.

64
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:41,029
I'll sing if I have to.

65
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,850
Wait, are you saying--?
Is he gonna sing?

66
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,000
Oh, God, is Angel gonna sing?

67
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,490
You don't have to.
A break for you, for me...

68
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:53,910
...and for Mr. Manilow.

69
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,439
Okay. If you're sure.

70
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,329
Poor Angelito. Here.

71
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:03,930
- What's this?
- A friend in Ojai.

72
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:08,199
Even though, does he ever call?
Write? Good guy, though.

73
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,459
Ever hear of T'ish Magev?

74
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,230
Ramone. I was just thinking
I'd rather be drinking.

75
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,709
He is a treasure.

76
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,019
T'ish Magev? He's like a swami, right?

77
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,089
Very powerful?
And this is his address.

78
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,079
I'm sending you to him.
You need more than I can do.

79
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,310
Shock your chakras,
filet your soul, whatever you need.

80
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:32,519
Go to him.

81
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:36,509
Lovely! That was Cher-iffic boys!

82
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:45,079
- We're going. I don't have to sing.
- Oh, thank God!

83
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:48,189
For your sake.
I know you don't like to.

84
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,829
He'll be back soon,

85
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,879
This swami guy sounds magic.

86
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,180
Probably do a spell and zap this
obsession right out of Angel.

87
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:06,220
Intriguing notion.
Psychiatry through magic.

88
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:11,569
Instant cures for phobias,
compulsions, identity crises.

89
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:14,230
Hey, look at me! I'm Angel.

90
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:16,600
He doesn't spin so much.

91
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,579
Right! This is Angel.

92
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:25,339
"I can't do anything fun tonight.
I have to count my past sins...

93
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:30,459
...then alphabetize them. By the way,
I'm thinking of snapping on Friday."

94
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:35,269
I love Angel and everything...

95
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,370
...but I'm so glad he's headed
the other way.

96
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,189
Yeah?

97
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:59,860
- I'm looking for the T'ish Magev.
- Found him.

98
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,240
Really? You're the swami?

99
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:08,009
- You the vampire with the soul?
- Yeah.

100
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,810
In or out? You're letting
in the bugs.

101
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,420
- Where's Angel?
- He's not here.

102
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:29,120
- You're lying. Give me Angel.
- I can't. Let go!

103
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:31,980
It's about time you--

104
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,860
My boss needs your boss,
so I can't leave without Angel.

105
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,649
Get him, or I'll blow your head off.

106
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,549
No! No, I.... I can't.

107
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,649
- I don't know where he is, I swear.
- That's too bad.

108
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,980
Wait! Wait! I can--

109
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,000
Please!

110
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:53,620
I'm Angel.

111
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:56,899
You looking for me?

112
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:05,639
Nice ride.

113
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:09,580
- Sorry?
- The car. Very slick.

114
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:11,110
Thanks.

115
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,710
What kind of mileage you get?

116
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:18,509
I don't know, 12 in the city.

117
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:19,539
Gas hog.

118
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:22,399
Probably a chick magnet, right?

119
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:23,710
What?

120
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:26,779
No.

121
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,509
If you say so.

122
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,779
I'm here to talk about my problems.

123
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,679
That car is your problem.
Says everything.

124
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,450
The car?

125
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:43,000
- In L.A. it's all about your car.
- I don't think--

126
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:47,980
A vampire, living in a city known for
its sun, driving a convertible.

127
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:52,360
- Why do you hate yourself?
- I don't. I got a deal.

128
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,590
A deal? Why not a license plate
that says "Irony"?

129
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,370
Top goes up.

130
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:01,179
Appearances. Very important to you.

131
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:03,299
- That's not true.
- Sure it is.

132
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:06,230
You put your eternal life at risk...

133
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:09,970
- ...whenever you get in that thing.
- It's just a car.

134
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,549
Why the layers of black?

135
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:15,230
It's about 80 degrees
in the shade lately.

136
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:18,019
I don't have a body temperature, so--

137
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,720
So it's for the look.

138
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,090
No. This way, I don't have
to worry about matching.

139
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:26,809
- I have no reflection--
- You do.

140
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:29,610
I do?

141
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,259
You're reflected in the people
around you. The way they see you.

142
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,549
What do you think they see?

143
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:42,720
That-- That-- That won't kill me.

144
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:45,269
Fine. Let's go.

145
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,860
- Follow me.
- You expect me to follow?

146
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,169
I don't see why I should.

147
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,539
You know the gun won't kill me.

148
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:57,690
What's it gonna do to her?

149
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:01,500
- Come on.
- Yes, all right.

150
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,610
But I shan't be cooperative.

151
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,399
I invite you in.

152
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,679
Thank you. Considerate.

153
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:22,009
You say it was my intention.

154
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:27,120
Obviously someone gives your
drivers their instructions.

155
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:30,159
And your drivers?
A little overreaction.

156
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:33,409
Never know what that will lead to.

157
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:37,919
It's good we got together. Cleared
it up, no misunderstandings.

158
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,000
I think you understand
perfectly, Paul.

159
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,840
This is Angel.

160
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:49,179
Angel. Sorry to make you wait.
Business thing.

161
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,240
Come on in.

162
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:56,480
I'm pleased to meet you, Angel.
My name is Magnus Bryce.

163
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,649
Benny, get him a drink.

164
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:04,080
I know who you are. I read the papers.

165
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:06,940
This isn't the way to get
my cooperation.

166
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:11,840
- Your man abducted me.
- I understand, but I'm desperate.

167
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,559
You help people. I need help.

168
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,559
Protection for someone
very dear to me.

169
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,929
Relax and let me explain.

170
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,590
Cheers.

171
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,460
Blood?

172
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,690
I don't usually drink in front
of humans.

173
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:30,440
Don't insult me. Go on.

174
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:32,000
It's fresh.

175
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,100
Dear God!

176
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,769
That's...

177
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:51,169
...nummy.

178
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:56,059
The cable network is all a front.
The family money is from wizardry.

179
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,750
My great-grandfather created
our first spell, a tallness illusion.

180
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:06,049
Now it's all custom-design work
for people with the right money.

181
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:07,409
Really?

182
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:09,759
See someone with looks and talent...

183
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:13,750
...chances are
we provided one of them.

184
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,139
The goddess Yeska doesn't
give with both hands.

185
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,450
Not a nice business.
I have a lot of enemies.

186
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,889
Like the man in the hall?

187
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:26,779
Paul Lanier?

188
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:31,639
His firm's in wish-granting.
Euro-creep. And there are others.

189
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,100
- Lanier's threatening you?
- Someone...

190
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,100
...is threatening my daughter.

191
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,980
My only family.

192
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:42,730
Maybe it's Briggs
at Consolidated Curses.

193
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:47,309
There are letters, calls.
We've caught intruders in the house.

194
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,789
You're a powerful wizard.
You must know protection spells.

195
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:55,600
These guys are in the business.
They know the tricks.

196
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:58,750
- You want me to say I'll protect her.
- No.

197
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:03,509
You don't get to say anything.

198
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:06,690
I'm gonna pay you a lot of money.

199
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:08,909
You'll do it and get paid.

200
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:11,700
And we'll both be very happy.

201
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,149
There are two "you's,"

202
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,610
Two me's?

203
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,990
The image you've worked to
create, and the real you.

204
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:32,289
- Maybe my persona is a little affected.
- A little affected? Come on.

205
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:36,710
Do many warriors slated for
the apocalypse use hair gel?

206
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:39,460
You're fighting ultimate evil...

207
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:42,429
...you want something with hold.

208
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:47,789
But can you triumph over darkness
if you're fighting yourself?

209
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,899
- You think I fight myself?
- Let's see.

210
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,690
Honey, we have a guest.

211
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,529
Oh, look. The vampire's here.

212
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,690
Yes. Hello.

213
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,039
Daddy can send out for about anything.

214
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,710
Virginia, Angel's gone
out of his way to help us.

215
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:13,200
He has not. You probably
brought him at gunpoint.

216
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,129
What? What's wrong?

217
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,620
- Cover that mirror!
- Why?

218
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,100
Do it!

219
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,190
I'm terribly sorry.
It's just strategy.

220
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,740
If the attack were to happen here--

221
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:45,779
If I were to fight here,
I wouldn't want my opponents...

222
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:48,570
...to know too soon what I really am.

223
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:50,659
Good man.

224
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:54,210
Great. He's gonna let
kidnappers into my room.

225
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,889
May I speak to Virginia alone?

226
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:00,679
I'll be right outside.

227
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,370
You were right. I didn't want
to be here.

228
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,100
- He thinks he owns everyone.
- But there are threats.

229
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,889
You need to be protected.

230
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,909
Lots of books. Must spend time in here.

231
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,669
There have been many threats.
Each new one, I buy a bookshelf.

232
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:31,870
Virginia, we're both stuck here.
So it seems to me...

233
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,529
...I may as well do what he wants me
to do and protect you.

234
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,649
Think you're the vampire for the job?

235
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,629
Well, I want to try.

236
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,320
You gonna fight me?

237
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,269
Let's go shopping.

238
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,350
What?

239
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,240
Wouldn't you rather wait
till morning...

240
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:00,539
...when I can't leave the house?

241
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:04,480
Yes, as your bodyguard,
I insist we go at once.

242
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:08,799
We're going shopping.

243
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:12,009
- At gunpoint?
- Yes. The point of a gun.

244
00:17:13,009 --> 00:17:15,430
He walked Wesley right out of here.

245
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:19,240
And this "I'm Angel" thing is
a very bad idea.

246
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:23,299
If I thought it would work,
I could have been Angel.

247
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,839
- It's a girlie name.
- Where'd they go?

248
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:29,900
- I tried to follow but lost them.
- What's the plan?

249
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:34,059
You go get Angel from the swami place,
I track down Wesley.

250
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:38,650
The guy was pretty distinctive.
Maybe he has a criminal record.

251
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,279
Mug shots!

252
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:43,210
It'll take me a while
to find this place.

253
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,599
Gunn, this thug guy is bad news.

254
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,309
I hate to think where Wesley is.

255
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,670
I say, this place is extraordinary.

256
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:01,839
Wizard supplies.

257
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,839
It's a little exposed though,
isn't it?

258
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,099
Are you really safe here?

259
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:13,109
You tell me.

260
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:15,859
Oh, yes.

261
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:17,730
My job, exactly.

262
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:20,730
To make it safe.

263
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,549
I shall certainly do my best.

264
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:28,269
We all do our best for Daddy.
Makes shopping for him a real pain.

265
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,630
We're looking for a gift?

266
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,250
His birthday. Number 50.
That's why he's so twitchy lately.

267
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:39,329
Big party makes security dodgy.

268
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:42,470
Plus, there's a mid-life
thing going on.

269
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:46,180
Talismans?

270
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:50,230
Images of the goddess Yeska,
his favorite creepy deity.

271
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,710
- What do you think of the gold one?
- Attractive.

272
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:58,799
It isn't real gold.
One good spell would melt it.

273
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:02,019
- Go with iron.
- You sound like Dad.

274
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,329
He really gets into all this stuff.

275
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,619
Loves it all. The rituals, magic....

276
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,130
You don't love it?

277
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:13,700
I used to, when I was little.

278
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:16,700
It's been just us for a long time.

279
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,490
He used to sit me next to him...

280
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,319
...and teach me about runic
incantations or enchanted armor.

281
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:28,380
- Not anymore?
- No. I mean--

282
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,960
He still loves the stuff.

283
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:34,529
Guy's gotta love something.

284
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,039
He obviously loves you. He's gone
to some trouble to protect you.

285
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:42,109
He has his car insured too.

286
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,539
Doesn't that hurt?

287
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:48,400
Oh! Hot! Hot.

288
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,490
Cold! Cold.

289
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,240
Virginia, say goodbye to
the pretty guy.

290
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:56,690
- Wait--
- Angel!

291
00:19:58,009 --> 00:19:59,690
You're Angel? The vampire?

292
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:01,910
Yes, I am.

293
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:05,410
I'm Angel. The vampire with a soul.

294
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,529
Fighting for my redemption with...

295
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,660
...killing evil demons.

296
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:15,779
That's right, scourge
of the demon world.

297
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:18,640
Don't worry, I don't kill humans.

298
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,690
Unless I'm angry.

299
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:24,430
- We were just doing what he said.
- Lanier?

300
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,329
Fine.

301
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:30,319
You're gonna leave now.
Then tell Lanier--

302
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:36,329
Forget about the girl.

303
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:37,779
Now, go.

304
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,599
We better get you home. It's not safe.

305
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,269
I think if we give them a next time,
it could get a lot rougher.

306
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:57,650
- What are you afraid of?
- Nothing.

307
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:02,980
You're wimping.

308
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,589
- This isn't a dance. Fight!
- I am.

309
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,059
Fighting yourself. Fight me!

310
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,680
Why can't you let go?

311
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:13,819
- Because.
- Why?

312
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:16,740
If I let it, it'll kill you.

313
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:17,880
It?

314
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:21,619
The demon.

315
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:24,259
- But the demon is you.
- No.

316
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:28,099
Yes. That's the thing you've
tried so hard to conceal.

317
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,900
I can't let it control me.

318
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:33,900
I see.

319
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:39,400
You don't think it controls you?

320
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,589
I can't do this much longer,

321
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,769
There's something we didn't
think about.

322
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:51,680
- He can smell blood,
- What are you talking about?

323
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,329
It's only a matter of time before...

324
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:57,259
...he finds the real Magev's body.

325
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:00,019
I know you want me to keep him here--

326
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,500
Stop. Angel's there?

327
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,670
Yeah. He's right outside. Brooding.

328
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:08,869
Came after he spoke to the host,
like Ramone said. Why?

329
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,029
The vampire's with you?

330
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:16,279
Then who the hell is the English guy?

331
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,750
Celeb photos.

332
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,240
Celeb photos. Page 46.

333
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:56,269
It's him!

334
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,750
I hope you weren't frightened.

335
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:03,220
No. More angry, you know.

336
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,940
- They tried to intimidate you.
- Not at them, at everything.

337
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,339
The fact that I have to
live like this.

338
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:12,039
- It's a bad situation.
- It's a bad situation?

339
00:23:13,609 --> 00:23:15,220
It's a waste of a life.

340
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,640
I keep waiting for my life
to start, and it never does.

341
00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:23,960
There's just more locks and
surveillance cameras and....

342
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:27,470
Guards? What is this now?
Bedroom guards?

343
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:30,640
- You go back and tell my dad--
- Stop it!

344
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:35,160
Let your flesh be weakened.

345
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,529
You were amazing.

346
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:50,170
I was a bit.

347
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,009
Your face. You don't go all...

348
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:57,400
...like a regular vampire.

349
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:02,930
I suppose I'm not like
a regular vampire.

350
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,490
Not a vampire at all really.

351
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:09,680
They brought her back as a human.

352
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:13,490
This Darla girl, why'd they do that?

353
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,690
I don't know. But seeing
her again, it's just....

354
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,160
It's triggered the inner struggle.

355
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:23,789
- Yeah.
- She's not the one who did this to you.

356
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,710
No, it's still Darla.
It's kind of hard to explain.

357
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:30,500
What hard? You're obsessed.

358
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,019
- I guess I am a little, yeah.
- You blame her.

359
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,420
- I suppose.
- You want to punish her.

360
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,859
- A bit.
- And you want to thank her.

361
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,930
- Thank her?
- For the gift she gave you.

362
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:45,640
- Gift?
- You're deeply ambivalent.

363
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:49,309
- I am and I'm not.
- You need to get over her.

364
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:52,910
Okay, what does she look like?

365
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,180
She's beautiful. Small, blond.

366
00:24:58,009 --> 00:24:59,690
Right. So here's what you do.

367
00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:02,509
You go out and find yourself
a small, blond thing.

368
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,960
You bed her, love her, you treat
her like crap. You break her heart.

369
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:10,279
You and your inner demon
will thank me, I promise.

370
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:19,130
Are you all right? I mean,
two close calls like that?

371
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:25,019
I guess so. I don't know.

372
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,259
Are we safe now?

373
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:29,480
I don't know.

374
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,859
Sometimes I think about running away.

375
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:39,779
Isn't that ridiculous?
A 24-year-old runaway?

376
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,559
We all want to escape
our lives sometimes.

377
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:50,259
I think about getting my own place.
A little apartment.

378
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:54,109
A job. Something silly, like...

379
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:59,079
...a perfume sprayer or
working in a tire store.

380
00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:02,549
A tire store?

381
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:05,859
- I told you it was ridiculous.
- No, it sounds wonderful.

382
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,529
Rotating tires, inflating things.

383
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,849
Your father wouldn't allow it.

384
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:15,920
No, it's too dangerous.

385
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:21,740
He says they would grab me in a
second and use me to get to him.

386
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:27,250
If you think about it,
he's saying that if I moved out...

387
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:30,849
...it would kill him.
I'd be responsible.

388
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,450
That's a huge burden to put on you.

389
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,789
I just...

390
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,750
...I just want out.

391
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:53,970
Virginia....

392
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:03,740
I'm sorry. I know we can't.

393
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,059
Yes. Why?

394
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:11,079
You're a pretty famous guy, Angel.
I hear the guards talk sometimes.

395
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,700
- I know.
- Know?

396
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,329
About the curse.

397
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,289
The curse.

398
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,420
- Curse?
- Yeah, I thought you knew.

399
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,359
They don't tell me everything.

400
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:32,640
- So you really can't...at all?
- That's what makes me special, right?

401
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,250
Right. No, that's real special.

402
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,259
So it's a sex thing?

403
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,150
- I mean, not specifically.
- Then what specifically?

404
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,829
Perfect happiness.
Yes, of course.

405
00:27:48,089 --> 00:27:49,140
Mustn't....

406
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,880
Mustn't....

407
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,349
Mustn't let oneself...

408
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,650
...let myself get...

409
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,589
...diabolical.
Consequences....

410
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,539
I should....

411
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,720
You know, this whole curse thing
has been widely misinterpreted.

412
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:16,140
Really?

413
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,220
Oh, yes.

414
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,869
Less of a curse.
More of a hex, actually.

415
00:28:24,089 --> 00:28:25,980
Barely that.

416
00:28:27,089 --> 00:28:28,809
A recommendation.

417
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:35,900
Are you sure you're telling the truth?

418
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:40,339
I wanna be honest with you.
I want to tell you everything.

419
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:43,980
I'm not actually....

420
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:05,200
Yo, yo! Anybody home?

421
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,569
Morning, traveler.

422
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:10,359
- Do you seek enlightenment?
- I seek Angel. He with you?

423
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:13,809
He was until the sun came up. Then....

424
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:16,289
See that pile of dust over there?

425
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,309
I'm just joking.
He's inside. Come on.

426
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,799
Joking? We got ourselves
a funny Zen master.

427
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:30,400
Which lesson was that, exactly?

428
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,509
He was not your friend.
I sensed danger.

429
00:29:34,369 --> 00:29:36,509
Where's the real T'ish Magev?
Did you kill him?

430
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:38,349
Did you put him in the lake?

431
00:29:39,769 --> 00:29:42,470
Something like that.
But you know what?

432
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:46,740
I'm not worried about you now,
seeing as you can't get any closer.

433
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:52,420
Wonderful sunshine.
Wish you were here.

434
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,660
- What are you doing?
- Getting in touch with my inner demon.

435
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:38,170
There you are! I found you!

436
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:40,430
How did you get in here?

437
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,460
I told them I worked for Angel,
and they sent me in.

438
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:46,150
You've got everybody scared here.

439
00:30:46,369 --> 00:30:48,440
They don't even know you're a Shemp.

440
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:52,000
- Hey, you're Virginia Bryce.
- Who are you?

441
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:54,970
This is Cordelia Chase.
She works for me.

442
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,559
Virginia, I left my coat....

443
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,150
I'll get it.

444
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:05,029
Good move. Let's scuttle
our butts out of here!

445
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,849
- I'm not going with you.
- What?

446
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:10,289
I'm rescuing you.
Key ingredient: We leave.

447
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,410
I understand. But I have to stay.
I have a job to do.

448
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,980
What is wrong with you?
You've got delusions of Angel.

449
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,430
You're not him. You can't
do stuff on your own.

450
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:23,420
Oh, crud.

451
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:28,279
Mr. Bryce, I've seen your picture.
And you're from the armed abduction.

452
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:33,750
I had Miss Chase testing your
defensive perimeter, and I must say...

453
00:31:34,369 --> 00:31:36,470
...did you know your
guards just let her in?

454
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:40,700
I told them to. I wanted my daughter
to hear them call you your real name.

455
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:43,710
- Wait.
- What's going on? What real name?

456
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,599
I got a call from an anonymous
friend with some information.

457
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:50,240
- This guy isn't Angel.
- I am so Angel!

458
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,630
No, not the sun, for I'm a vampire!

459
00:31:54,769 --> 00:31:56,559
Oh, no, it burns!

460
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:05,880
You're not Angel.

461
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:18,230
My name is Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.

462
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:26,480
I talked to you. I trusted you.

463
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:29,170
You lied to me.

464
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:34,039
Come to think of it, you
actually put my life in danger.

465
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,710
I was walking around thinking
I had vampire protection.

466
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,960
Here's the funny part.
I finally thought I had a friend.

467
00:32:58,369 --> 00:33:01,700
- You kind of screwed her over.
- Get out of my house.

468
00:33:02,569 --> 00:33:04,009
Take the piece with you.

469
00:33:04,369 --> 00:33:06,720
The piece?
Is that supposed to be me?

470
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,640
Should've let me kill him.
You gonna let him go?

471
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,569
Never tell me what to do!
You brought me the wrong guy.

472
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,250
You risked the whole sacrifice.
Understand?

473
00:33:17,569 --> 00:33:21,119
But I'm not gonna kill you,
because I need you now, Benny.

474
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:24,259
It's only a few hours
till the sacrifice.

475
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,440
You understand the need
for security in this?

476
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:29,700
This is the party of my life.

477
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,130
Obviously, Virginia's too.

478
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,880
Well, that was pretty humiliating.

479
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:52,509
Angel, Gunn. What happened?

480
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:54,569
He got hit.

481
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:58,329
By who? The swami?
Swamis don't hit. Swamis swamm.

482
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:02,000
- Why is Wesley wearing my coat?
- There was a lot of swami.

483
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:04,400
- The T'ish Magev hit him?
- He was a fake.

484
00:34:05,369 --> 00:34:08,000
Someone hired him to get
me out of the way.

485
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:10,260
He took out the real Magev.

486
00:34:10,769 --> 00:34:13,400
- Did you find out who hired him?
- He wouldn't say.

487
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,579
That is my coat, right?

488
00:34:16,769 --> 00:34:20,420
It has to be Paul Lanier. He thought
that would keep Virginia unprotected.

489
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:24,519
When his men couldn't take me out,
he told Bryce I wasn't Angel.

490
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:28,610
- He hoped Bryce would get rid of me.
- What's going on?

491
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:31,539
- Were you in Virginia?
- That's not the point.

492
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,190
He posed as you, protecting
a girl named Virginia.

493
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:37,860
Lanier is trying to kill her
or abduct her or something.

494
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:40,510
She's probably in danger
at the party.

495
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:42,139
- Party?
- Her father's.

496
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:45,199
Big wizard event. Cake,
tributes to the goddess Yeska.

497
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:49,289
Yeska? Wait a minute. I know
Yeska. She's no goddess.

498
00:34:49,769 --> 00:34:51,980
- What do you mean?
- She's a Davric demon.

499
00:34:52,769 --> 00:34:55,860
They don't serve humans,
unless the humans make a sacrifice.

500
00:34:56,369 --> 00:35:00,159
- Sacrifice?
- Davrics eat live sacrifices, girls.

501
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:05,349
They grant huge power to the person
who offers a sacrifice on--

502
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:11,099
On their 50th birthday. Bryce is
gonna sacrifice his own daughter.

503
00:35:11,969 --> 00:35:13,969
Why is Lanier trying to abduct her?

504
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:16,860
Bryce will get a lot of
power off this sacrifice.

505
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:21,369
Angel, Gunn, go to the front of the
house. Cordelia, we'll go to the back.

506
00:35:22,769 --> 00:35:25,960
I'm sorry. You know this sort of
thing best. How should we proceed?

507
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:31,260
Well, Gunn and I could...

508
00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:33,599
...take the back.

509
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:37,610
- Very good. Let's go.
- Wesley, can I get my coat back?

510
00:35:49,929 --> 00:35:51,719
What is this horrible thing?

511
00:35:52,329 --> 00:35:54,650
I hope a girl isn't gonna
jump out of it or something.

512
00:35:55,329 --> 00:35:56,519
Not really.

513
00:35:58,329 --> 00:35:59,380
Thank you.

514
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:07,099
I wanna thank all of you for being
here on this special occasion.

515
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,070
My feelings....

516
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:17,050
My feelings run almost too deep for
words, but I'll try to do this...

517
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,289
...and do it right.

518
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:21,510
What is he talking about?

519
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:29,440
Yeska, of the razor eyes and
stone heart, take this offering.

520
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:35,300
I cast my most precious emerald into
the ocean on my 50th birthday.

521
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,599
Daddy, what are you doing?

522
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,280
Daddy? Hey! What are you--?

523
00:36:40,929 --> 00:36:43,210
- Take my gift.
- Daddy, stop them!

524
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,170
- Stop now!
- Let her death...

525
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,510
...return tenfold unto me my power.

526
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,289
Make them stop!

527
00:36:52,929 --> 00:36:56,510
Be a good girl now.
This is hard enough already.

528
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,199
He's really torn about it.

529
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:02,159
Help! Somebody help me!

530
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,809
Daddy?

531
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,199
- Release her or die.
- Don't I say that?

532
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,179
Guards!

533
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,320
I'll get you out of here.

534
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:55,380
The hour approaches, Yeska.
Do not be blind to my plea.

535
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:59,170
Yeska, I beseech thee!

536
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:02,769
Appear!

537
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,099
The sacrifice...

538
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:17,340
...is impure!

539
00:38:22,929 --> 00:38:25,179
- What's going on?
- Let's go.

540
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:29,090
- Why did you come back?
- I said I'd protect you.

541
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,039
She's impure?

542
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:39,719
She's not a virgin?

543
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,210
You....

544
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,110
- Impure?
- She slept with him?

545
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:48,820
This wouldn't have happened
if you were Angel.

546
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:51,960
That's why I hired him. He's a eunuch.

547
00:38:52,929 --> 00:38:54,190
- You slept with her?
- A eunuch?

548
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:58,030
- Things happen. Two people, danger.
- What are you talking about?

549
00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:00,219
She was a virgin before you got here.

550
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,869
- I was not a virgin!
- What?

551
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,940
- Thank God.
- I could've told you that.

552
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,519
- Not a eunuch.
- One day as Angel.

553
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,619
- One day, and he's getting some.
- What?

554
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,230
How could you?
I kept you away from all men.

555
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,929
The curse isn't even that clear.

556
00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:20,829
Daddy, you remember that chauffeur
from when I was 16? And the one at 18?

557
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:25,489
I haven't been a virgin
for a very long time.

558
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,920
I even dated Rick.

559
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:36,010
Ginny, don't do this.
Don't make me angry.

560
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:40,489
Right. Because then you
might do something bad.

561
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:43,349
You were going to kill me!

562
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,289
You are not my father anymore.

563
00:39:55,929 --> 00:39:57,230
I'm not a eunuch.

564
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:02,559
Look.

565
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:09,579
"Virginia Bryce, squired by
Mr. Wesley Wyndam-Pryce...

566
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:13,280
...private detective and
bodyguard to the stars."

567
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:17,340
- "Squired"? Who says squired?
- Look at him all over her.

568
00:40:18,769 --> 00:40:20,519
You're jealous he's getting attention.

569
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,309
Damn skippy! He's getting
famous off this!

570
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:25,320
Reflected glory, that's my thing!

571
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:27,690
Get a little perspective.

572
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:34,699
"Bodyguard to the stars."
Yeah, right.

573
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:38,699
There's no Wyndam-Pryce Agency,

574
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,500
Thank you, thank you very much,
