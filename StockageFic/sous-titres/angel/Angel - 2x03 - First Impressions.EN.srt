1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:02,839
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:05,660
You expecting somebody else?

3
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:08,550
We're on the same side.
Why can't we fight together?

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,179
I'm on my own.

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,580
You won't be happy until you
get close to death.

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,359
It's not gonna happen, little sister.

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:19,920
Goodbye, Alana.

8
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:25,600
I killed her.
She was the reason, man.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,000
- It's haunted.
- It's rent-controlled!

10
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:30,359
I have a roommate that I never see.

11
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:32,939
Hey, Dennis, put that back!

12
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,579
We'll even the score with him.
Beginning with what's in that box.

13
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,460
We're all very pleased
you're here, Darla.

14
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:44,979
- He's here.
- Angel.

15
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:48,609
I'd love to see that boy.

16
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,390
"Send in the Clowns" and
"Tears of a Clown," both in one night!

17
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:58,810
Well, I was sort of
going for a medley.

18
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,099
- More of a due-dly really, wasn't it?
- I couldn't come up with a third.

19
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,489
I've never seen you open up
like that before.

20
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:12,430
- You've been practicing, haven't you?
- A little.

21
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:14,939
- Where?
- In the shower.

22
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:19,170
It so shows. You really put
your heart into it.

23
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,790
- Question is, what happens to it now?
- It?

24
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,209
Your heart, big softie. It may not be
beating, but it can still break.

25
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,319
- What do you mean?
- You've come to a bend in your road.

26
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,950
Whether that slows you down
is up to you.

27
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,200
There are hills and mountains
Between us

28
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,040
Always something to get over

29
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,490
Darla. I was afraid
you weren't coming.

30
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,949
- I've been here the whole time, silly.
- You have?

31
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,419
Just waiting for you.

32
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:27,259
Aren't you going to ask me to dance?

33
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,610
Right here, right now

34
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,189
Right by my side
Yeah

35
00:02:57,729 --> 00:02:59,939
I still can't believe you're here.

36
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:03,039
I mean, I killed you.

37
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,319
I'm over that.

38
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:12,219
Have you told anyone about
these dates of ours?

39
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:16,060
No. I want you all for myself.

40
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:20,020
I know how you feel.

41
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:23,659
It's so strange.

42
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,050
But good.

43
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,900
But good.

44
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:39,500
Somebody get these two
love vamps a room.

45
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:57,649
- This place will never get clean.
- It's just a little dust.

46
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,279
Oh, this isn't mere dust.
This is Son of Dust.

47
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,970
This is the kind of dust that spawns
generations of baby dust.

48
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:12,550
- I give up.
- We'll just move back to your place.

49
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:14,529
And I'm dusting.

50
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,310
Where's Angel?

51
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:21,829
- I believe the word is "Hello."
- "Where's Angel?" summed it up.

52
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,310
- We got work to do.
- He's still sleeping.

53
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:27,689
Sleeping? It's 3:30.
I've been up since dawn.

54
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:31,540
Sort of missing the whole "Creature
of the Night" angle.

55
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:34,579
- I know I said 4:00.
- You had an appointment?

56
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:36,699
He didn't brief you?

57
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,759
We're meeting a snitch downtown.

58
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:41,810
- The guy has a line on Deevak.
- Deevak?

59
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:45,689
Demon in my neighborhood.
He hurt two of my men.

60
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:47,949
Can you go in and knock on his coffin?

61
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:49,970
He doesn't use a coffin.

62
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,930
Haven't you heard the expression
"Let sleeping vampires lie"?

63
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,420
He'll rise on his own.
He always does.

64
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,439
Maybe we can help.

65
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,120
To find Deevak, I'm gonna need
more than C-3PO...

66
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:12,449
...and Stick-Figure Barbie with me.
No offense.

67
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:16,709
- Very little taken.
- He's a badass. I need serious muscle.

68
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:23,310
Demons of the underworld, beware!
Your time on Earth is drawing nigh!

69
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:30,060
- David, hi.
- I got here as quick as I could.

70
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:31,649
We paged you two days ago.

71
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:34,750
I was in Kuala Lumpur.
Hostile takeover.

72
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:39,399
Identify yourself, traveler.
Are you also a fellow demon-killer?

73
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:41,180
Who is this guy?

74
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:43,470
David Nabit, meet Charles Gunn.

75
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:45,379
Gunn, Nabit.

76
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:47,389
Pleasure's all mine.

77
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:51,300
So where's Angel?

78
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:55,389
- He's still sleeping.
- At 3:30? I've been up since dawn.

79
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,160
Sorry I'm late.

80
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,100
I stand ready to fight the good
fight, sir. What do you need?

81
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:03,029
Financial advice.

82
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:06,660
Okay. Good.

83
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,800
This is our new base of operations.
We're leasing with an option to buy.

84
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:14,459
What are you willing
to put down?

85
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,399
- "Nothing" would be good.
- Oh, easy.

86
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:20,279
You could finance
and take over the owner's payments...

87
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:23,329
...or get a preservation grant...

88
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:27,399
...and restore the original decor
and get a tax break and a loan...

89
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,120
...or you could try for an FHA
and get a PMI.

90
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:35,420
Is anybody else getting warm?

91
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,939
Do that "tax breaks,
FHA and PMI" part again.

92
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,490
I'll have my money guy
run some numbers, and we'll....

93
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:52,470
Thanks.

94
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,089
Is this demon-fighting cool
or what, huh?

95
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,629
- We need to move on this.
- Relax. We'll make it.

96
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,100
Relax? When you need a favor,
I'm there.

97
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,629
First time I need your help,
you sleep all day.

98
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,930
Cordy, you're driving.

99
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,529
Me, drive your car? So cool.

100
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,629
- We're gonna need some bribe money.
- Wait a minute.

101
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,490
- Thought you wanted to move on this.
- They'll slow us up.

102
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,579
To go against Deevak,
we need help.

103
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:28,189
Pick me up in the back.

104
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,889
- Good.
- Shotgun.

105
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,480
Too late, he split.

106
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:06,440
Maybe he heard
what a pleasant person you were.

107
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,419
There.

108
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,580
- Who's Gunn?
- Me. You Jameel?

109
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,159
Here's the money.

110
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,629
Keep it.

111
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,230
I changed my mind.

112
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,639
Fine. You're gonna tell me
where Deevak is.

113
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:43,740
I know you have a rep, and I ain't
looking to make no new enemies.

114
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:47,700
I can't help you with Deevak.
He'll know it was me.

115
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:50,940
Demon's got eyes, ears
and teeth all over.

116
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:54,720
There's a chance he had
some vamps tail me here.

117
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,529
I don't see nothing.

118
00:09:57,169 --> 00:10:01,519
Good. I'm just here to pay my respects
and get home before sundown.

119
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,289
You better tell me what you know.

120
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:08,830
I'm sorry. But Deevak scares me
a lot more than you do.

121
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:13,179
Gunn!

122
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,879
- Scared now?
- What are you doing?

123
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:18,789
- I got people dying.
- I didn't do anything!

124
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,679
Think I care? It's survival of the
fittest, and you don't look too fit.

125
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,039
- Let go. This is my case.
- It was. Now it's mine.

126
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,409
- Angel!
- I told you I was being watched.

127
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:26,909
- I'm so sick of dust.
- I can't lift my arm.

128
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:32,019
- This vamp did a number on my ribs.
- Afraid I threw my back out again.

129
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,139
Lovely.

130
00:11:39,169 --> 00:11:41,799
Grease stains all over my new outfit!

131
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:49,950
Maybe my pain isn't physical, but my
dry-cleaning bill will be huge.

132
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,100
We still didn't find Deevak.

133
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,059
- Probably for the best.
- How do you figure?

134
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,690
We're not prepared to face Deevak
in our condition.

135
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:01,330
You ready to pack it in?

136
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,139
I thought you were
the demon experts.

137
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,110
We should've been able to lick them
faster than that. We need to regroup.

138
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,669
I'm gonna track down
Jameel and make him talk.

139
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,759
When you do, you may wanna be more
Guy Pearce in L.A. Confidential...

140
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:20,419
...and less Michael Madsen
in Reservoir Dogs,

141
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:25,000
I haven't seen a movie since Denzel
was robbed of the Oscar for Malcolm X,

142
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,730
Later.

143
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:34,000
- That was quite a performance.
- Talk about wound up too tight.

144
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,409
No, I mean Denzel.

145
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:37,610
Oh.

146
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,649
Well, he's always great.

147
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,629
What about you?

148
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:43,750
Who doesn't love Denzel?

149
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,820
No, what you said before. It's true.

150
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,529
You've never had such trouble
with a simple vampire.

151
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,110
Off day. Let's go.

152
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:08,529
- Home sweet hotel.
- Just bring the car back tomorrow.

153
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,049
- Are you okay?
- I just need some sleep.

154
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:16,230
That seems to be all
you've been doing lately.

155
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:19,129
- Not that I'm judging.
- Good night.

156
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,610
Sleep tight.

157
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,960
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

158
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:34,200
Jeez, Dennis. It's like
a meat locker in here.

159
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,669
Did you turn down
the thermostat again?

160
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,610
Thank you.

161
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,379
What is it with ghosts and cold rooms?

162
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,129
Dennis! Phone!

163
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:39,230
What's that ringing?

164
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,009
Nothing, darling. It'll stop.

165
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,629
Where's it coming from?

166
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:48,230
Ignore it.

167
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,509
Why are you so good to me
after everything I did?

168
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,110
Because...

169
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,250
...you and I are one.

170
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,149
See? I told you it would stop.

171
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,289
Wesley, where are you? Are you there?

172
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,539
Wesley? Where are you guys?

173
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:26,610
I don't know what I should do.

174
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:29,399
I had a vision. It's Gunn.

175
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:32,649
He's in trouble. I think it's bad.

176
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:34,519
Where are you guys?

177
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,169
I'm going over there.
When you get this message...

178
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:42,600
...get Angel and meet me
at Gunn's, okay?

179
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,899
I need a weapon.

180
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,730
Okay, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.

181
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:19,509
Gunn?

182
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,940
Are you crazy?
What the hell are you doing?

183
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,009
Saving you from a killer demon!

184
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,350
Not a demon?

185
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:52,149
And I didn't just save your life?

186
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,299
Right.

187
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,890
- What are you thinking about?
- You. Us.

188
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:08,150
- You seem sad.

189
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:11,700
It's just.... I have to go.

190
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:15,059
- Where?
- Away.

191
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:20,029
- I'll go with you.
- You can't. I'm in danger.

192
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,089
I'll protect you.

193
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,319
You're too busy
protecting everyone else.

194
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,059
Wesley? Stop it!

195
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,619
- You made her go away!
- Angel, it's me!

196
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,029
- What are you doing here?
- Gunn's in trouble. Can't breathe.

197
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,230
- Gunn can't breathe?
- I can't breathe!

198
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:56,960
Oh, sorry.

199
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:00,519
It's quite all right.

200
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,240
Now, about the naked thing.

201
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,839
- I'll get dressed.
- Much appreciated.

202
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,400
No, no.

203
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:17,700
- There you go. Good as new.
- I think you cracked my skull.

204
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:20,250
Well, that's new, right?

205
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:26,420
- Where are you going?
- Walking you out. You're going home.

206
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:31,829
Don't dismiss me.
I know what I'm talking about.

207
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,650
Like how you knew Joey was a demon?

208
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:37,019
I was just trying to help you.

209
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,000
It helps a guy's rep when a white
beauty queen comes to his rescue...

210
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,309
- ...in front of his crew.
- You are in big-time danger.

211
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,859
I saw you in a vision,
fighting for your life.

212
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,920
You were so scared!

213
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,309
I don't get scared.

214
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,869
I do. Sometimes I get terrified.

215
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,099
Right now, I am scared for you.

216
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:02,430
Be scared for me back at your place.

217
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,339
I won't leave until you're safe.

218
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:07,299
I don't want a sidekick, so go home.

219
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:10,690
- No.
- Thanks for coming. Drive safe.

220
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,059
So where's your car?

221
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,400
So where's your car?

222
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:24,910
Angel is not gonna be happy...

223
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,910
...when he finds out
I let his car get stolen.

224
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,000
What are the chances that
a vampire has insurance?

225
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,160
I'll find the car.

226
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:36,319
How are you gonna do that?

227
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,960
There's a couple of guys
that jack vintage cars.

228
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:40,829
We'll look until we find it.

229
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,880
Then what? Just ask
them to give it back?

230
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:46,130
I'll say please.

231
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,880
You'll use your charm, like you did
this afternoon with that pigeon stool.

232
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,329
It's "stool pigeon."

233
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:55,759
You have no clue about me.

234
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:59,740
- Paging Mr. Rationalization.
- Ms. About-to-be-thrown-out-of-a-car!

235
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:04,190
Be rude, but I'm not going anywhere
until I know you're safe.

236
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:08,039
Me, rude? You showed up,
attacked my boy...

237
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,410
...then hijacked my life.

238
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:13,410
I find your car,
you give me my freedom back.

239
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,859
That's not how it works.
You need protection.

240
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:19,230
And how do you plan to protect me?

241
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:21,630
With some weak ladysmith battle-ax?

242
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:26,140
Ask Joey and his cracked skull
how weak it is.

243
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:30,200
Besides, I've also got this.

244
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:34,490
- Mace.
- Mace?

245
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,650
Squirt in the eyes.

246
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:38,539
Think I'll be jumped by
a purse-snatching demon?

247
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:43,710
It'll have to do, because I'm your
protector, whether you like it or not.

248
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,920
Somebody better attack me soon.
I can't take much more of this.

249
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:56,990
- What are you waiting for?
- I don't think it'll fit.

250
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,569
Yes, it will. Put it on.

251
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,220
I don't need a helmet.

252
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,670
It's the law.
Do you want us to get pulled over?

253
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,009
No.

254
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,579
Then what's the problem?

255
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:12,910
Well, it's just, you know...

256
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:16,970
...the visibility issue and
the hat-head thing--

257
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,789
Why do I get
the lady's helmet?

258
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:22,339
Stop being a wanker and put it on.

259
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,380
Looks good. Hop on board, gorgeous.

260
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,740
You'll pay for this.

261
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:52,339
It isn't here.

262
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:55,859
New acquisitions are in the garage.

263
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:58,089
Getting a makeover, I bet.

264
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:02,460
- What you looking for?
- '67 Plymouth convertible.

265
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,650
Give me a few days.

266
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:06,769
Cordelia, meet Henry.

267
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,960
New to the neighborhood?

268
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,039
- Someone stole my friend's car.
- '67 Plymouth.

269
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,970
- Wasn't me. Convertible, you said?
- Yeah.

270
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,849
Desmond's your man.
He can't pass up old convertibles.

271
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,730
Come on.

272
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:25,089
You won't find him at his shop.

273
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,460
Tito's having a party.
Everyone's invited.

274
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:32,539
Desmond'll be there.

275
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,170
- Where you jack these cars from?
- Around.

276
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:37,869
They look like neighborhood cars.

277
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:39,980
Now you want to start something.

278
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,930
Jack cars in Brentwood.
Leave the neighborhood cars alone.

279
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,309
Business is business.
You should mind your own.

280
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:51,730
I might have to put you
out of business.

281
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:54,210
Let's go.

282
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,769
- Surprised you didn't wet yourself.
- Him?

283
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,769
He's nothing, Deevak. Name's Gunn.

284
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,559
He thinks he runs this town.

285
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,680
I know who he is.

286
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:21,099
The trouble he's caused.

287
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:25,759
Tonight, it ends.

288
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:48,039
- Gunn, what are you doing here?
- I was gonna ask you the same thing.

289
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:50,450
We'll catch up later.

290
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,009
- You should be in the garment district.
- It was dead.

291
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:56,660
So you thought you'd party?

292
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,750
- It's just a little fun.
- It's you not obeying orders.

293
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:03,369
We got two men down.
Want to make it three?

294
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:07,809
Go home. I got things to take care of,
then we can chat.

295
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,539
Go!

296
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:16,420
Short enough leash, or do you get
all warm on the power-trip thing?

297
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:19,369
He needs discipline to survive.

298
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:21,089
Now shut up and stay close.

299
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:26,269
I'm not one of your toy soldiers
you can just boss around.

300
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,750
I don't even want you here.

301
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,950
Too bad. I am here.
And I don't take orders.

302
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:36,190
Well, except from Angel.
And he usually asks nicely.

303
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:39,829
Besides, I know how
to behave at a party.

304
00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:42,440
Trust me, I know how to blend.

305
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,170
Okay, not exactly blending.

306
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:58,569
I'll just shut up
and stay close.

307
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,619
Hey, stranger.

308
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:06,089
Hey, girl.

309
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:08,210
Looking good, Veronica.

310
00:25:08,569 --> 00:25:11,940
We've missed you at the store.
You should stop by.

311
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:14,210
I've been busy.

312
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:17,140
Who's your friend?

313
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:20,099
Who, me?

314
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:23,410
I'm no friend.
I'm just here on business.

315
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,779
I'm a working girl.

316
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,430
That came out wrong.

317
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,599
Obviously, I'm not a working girl.

318
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:35,519
Not that I couldn't be if I wanted to.
I could.

319
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:37,930
That sounded stuck-up.

320
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:42,289
Not that I could be a working girl
and you couldn't. Far from it.

321
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:46,009
You'd make a great....

322
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,799
Could you point me
to the hors d'oeuvres?

323
00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:53,349
We're looking for Desmond.

324
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,750
- You seen him?
- He's around.

325
00:25:56,569 --> 00:25:57,509
I'll catch up.

326
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:01,069
- You better. Don't forget about us.
- Never.

327
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:15,019
You friends with
every Criminal in town?

328
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,700
- You're assuming they're criminals.
- Aren't they?

329
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:22,069
Like David Nabit? Think he
got rich by being a good citizen?

330
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:23,349
Actually, he did.

331
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,819
He made millions creating software
for blind people to surf the Web.

332
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:31,529
He set up a foundation that donates
$20,000,000 a year...

333
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,220
...to countless charitable causes.

334
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,779
Let me know when some
of that trickles down here.

335
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:40,640
- There he is.
- Who? Car thief guy?

336
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:42,619
It's him. Desmond!

337
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,430
G-Man. Can I get you a brew?

338
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,000
You can get me the car you stole.

339
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:52,420
- What makes you think I did it?
- Don't play with me.

340
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:56,130
Hey, I had no idea that--

341
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,619
What's happening?

342
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,829
You're bleeding.

343
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:43,750
I'm gonna take care of you.
Try to relax.

344
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,109
Okay, try to sit up, okay?
Come on, easy.

345
00:27:57,289 --> 00:28:00,380
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

346
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,109
She needs a doctor. Now!

347
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:24,769
- We need a doctor. Where's a doctor?
- This way. Dr. Thomas!

348
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:26,609
What happened?

349
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:30,630
Glass in her neck. She took it
out before I could stop her.

350
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,509
It may have hit an artery.

351
00:28:33,329 --> 00:28:36,420
I put pressure on it, but
her pulse is weakening.

352
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,539
- She passed out.
- Will she be okay?

353
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,690
- Let us take care of her.
- Will she?

354
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:45,380
Your friend saved her life, but we
still have work to do. Let us do it.

355
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:48,529
Come on, she's in good hands.

356
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:28,380
She almost died.

357
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,920
- But she didn't.
- No thanks to me.

358
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:32,829
It's not your fault.

359
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:35,400
I let my guard down, and she--

360
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,369
They were coming after me.

361
00:29:42,329 --> 00:29:43,490
- Take it easy.
- I can't.

362
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:45,349
I can never take it easy.

363
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,980
When I do, someone like Alana
pays the price.

364
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,809
Alana?

365
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,339
Veronica.

366
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,599
I can't stop.

367
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,920
I can't ever stop.

368
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,130
Don't you move a muscle!

369
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,670
Where is my car?

370
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:37,529
Excuse me. Do you know Charles Gunn?

371
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,500
Someone said we might find him here.

372
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:43,569
No, I don't know.

373
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,950
Maybe he got hurt.

374
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,359
- You look like you're hurt.
- No, I'm fine.

375
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:50,170
What happened here?

376
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,079
I'm not sure.
It all happened so fast.

377
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,910
I don't know who
they were looking for...

378
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:00,079
...but they were strong,
like they were on drugs.

379
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:02,730
I just need to lie down.

380
00:31:02,849 --> 00:31:05,099
If you've suffered a head injury--

381
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:07,880
No, I'm okay. Really.

382
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,460
I was lucky, compared to the others.

383
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,579
You sure you're okay?

384
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:14,940
Yeah. Thanks.

385
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:17,279
Good.

386
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,400
Now start talking, huh.

387
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,960
There is a God. Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

388
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,200
You drive it out of here,
I'll follow you home.

389
00:31:41,849 --> 00:31:43,920
Just as soon as I find the keys.

390
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,380
You don't have the keys?

391
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,890
I left them in the car when
I went in to save you.

392
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,339
- Every second counted.
- You are one high-maintenance chick.

393
00:31:56,849 --> 00:31:58,990
The keys are here. Somewhere.

394
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:01,390
You are killing me!

395
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,339
Can't you hot-wire it?

396
00:32:05,849 --> 00:32:07,390
I am not a car thief.

397
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:10,809
Well, High-Moral-Ground Boy,
help me find them.

398
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:14,799
Looking for these?

399
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,039
Go.

400
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,309
- Not a chance.
- Go!

401
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:22,430
I'm not leaving you!

402
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,670
How touching. A woman willing
to die with her man.

403
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,670
He's not my man, he's just a friend.

404
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,759
About the willing to die part--

405
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,650
You must be Deevak. Damn, you're ugly.

406
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,609
And you're the big bad Gunn.

407
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,069
Heard you were looking for me.

408
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,230
Hey!

409
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:44,279
You found me.

410
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:50,940
How's it feel to meet up with
someone even nastier than you?

411
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:53,349
Not good, by the sound of it.

412
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:55,390
Stop it! You're killing him!

413
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:02,869
Survival of the fittest, bro.

414
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,440
Right now, you don't look too fit.

415
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:25,029
Oh, my God.

416
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:31,750
Cordy, ax!

417
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:01,389
Angel? Angel, look. I found your keys.

418
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:05,630
This substance doesn't appear
to be coming off.

419
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:07,369
- What is that?
- Demon blood.

420
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,869
Or demon pus. Or possibly both.

421
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,940
Anyone know how to hot-wire a car?

422
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:14,960
- Hey.
- Hey.

423
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:20,659
You finally saved my life.
Guess I should say thanks.

424
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,400
Yes, you should.

425
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,769
- And no, I didn't.
- What?

426
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,269
Deevak wasn't the danger
in my vision.

427
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,159
- He wasn't?
- No.

428
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,500
Then what was?

429
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:37,369
I'm looking at it.

430
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:39,909
It's you. You're the danger.

431
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,590
- Excuse me?
- It's how you live your life.

432
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:45,300
You don't just face danger,
you create it.

433
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:49,610
You're on a self-destruct mission.
You need help.

434
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,420
I don't buy this
Dionne Warwick crap.

435
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:55,190
You know it's true.

436
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:58,360
You need some serious saving.

437
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:01,789
I've got my work cut out for me.

438
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:03,659
Is that right?

439
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,139
Well, yeah.

440
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:08,489
Plan on having me in your
life for a while.

441
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:11,389
At least until you find some peace.

442
00:36:11,929 --> 00:36:13,230
Could be a while.

443
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:14,500
That's okay.

444
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:17,489
Helping people is what me
and my friends do.

445
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,039
Lucky me.

446
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:21,940
Hey...

447
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:24,519
...how about that "thank you"?

448
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,440
Honey, you're home.

449
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:05,199
- Hi.
- You look beat. What's wrong?

450
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:06,900
Nothing.

451
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,469
You save any lives today?

452
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:13,289
A few, yeah.

453
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,070
Did any of your friends say thank you?

454
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,619
Not exactly.

455
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:23,019
Typical. Next time I see them
I'm going to say something.

456
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:25,710
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't.

457
00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:30,820
- You give, and you give, and you give.
- I'm used to it.

458
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,969
Always the protector,
never the protected.

459
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,440
I have so much to make up for.

460
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,559
And you have.

461
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:41,409
You take care of so many people.

462
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,579
But who takes care of you?

463
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:54,469
- You do.
- That's right, I do.

464
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,480
Come on.

465
00:38:00,449 --> 00:38:01,320
Come on.

466
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,300
Lean back.

467
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:15,539
Now, you just relax...

468
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,190
...and let Darla take care of you.

469
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:35,449
- How's that?
- Good.

470
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,179
I'm just getting started, baby.

471
00:38:42,449 --> 00:38:44,170
I know how to please you.

472
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:50,550
All you have to do is let me.

473
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:06,289
I could just eat you up.

474
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,340
Thank you. Thank you very much.
