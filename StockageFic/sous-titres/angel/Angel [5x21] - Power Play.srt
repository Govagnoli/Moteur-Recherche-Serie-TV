Okay. Where did you learn

- Which part?
- Doesn't matter.

Go to Cabo, drink margaritas, midnight
skinny-dipping, making love on the beach...

Still, you can't enjoy
haunting this place.

not knowing what to do with yourself.

- And what do you know of it?

Ghost story, in fact.

51

Short of it is,
take my advice.

- Out.

tell me why.

Senator. Welcome
to Wolfram and Hart.

74
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:51,499
I go way back with this firm.
Back when Holland Manners was in charge.

75
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:53,701
You'll find things
have changed a bit since then.

- Vampire.

<i>Well, I believe in</i>
<i>diversity on my staff.</i>

80

- How commendable.

81
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:12,319
- Harmony, you mind gettin' us some coffee?
- Coming up.

82
00:06:12,429 --> 00:06:14,727
Oh. Thank you, no.
No coffee.

83
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:17,596
But if it isn't any trouble,
I think Ernesto might like some blood.

84
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:19,692
Virgin, if you have it.
Room temperature's fine.

85
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:22,704

<i>a "no human blood"policy.</i>

I can offer you something in a rodent.
We have some fruity, unassuming vole...

<i>I think we could make an exception</i>
<i>to our policy this time for the senator.</i>

Couldn't we, Angel?

89
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:36,215
Harmony, the lab might have something
in the blood bank.

<i>- Okay. You're the boss, boss.</i>

just have a teeny-weeny...

- No.
- Just thought I'd ask.

was Stacey Bluth.

<i>Call me if you find anything.</i>

00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,962
I didn't claw my way up from hell

steal my Senate seat.

- Wait. He's a pedophile?
- Not yet.

135
00:09:04,234 --> 00:09:06,862

00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,165
- Pardon me?
<i>- Help convince Conley he is.</i>

- Sparrow.

Not sure how long a reconditioning
like that would take.

164
00:10:51,908 --> 00:10:55,969
- There's a real buzz about you.
- So, how much longer do I
have to wait for an answer?

165
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,606
Hey, these things take time.
Trust me. It won't be long now.

166
00:11:06,356 --> 00:11:09,154
See? This isn't so bad now.

167
00:11:10,594 --> 00:11:14,223
Little field trip
out in the...

168
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:16,822
well, what passes
in this city for fresh air.

169
00:11:18,235 --> 00:11:21,204
All we need now is to bag ourselves
a Boretz demon...

170
00:11:21,304 --> 00:11:23,795
we got ourselves
a perfect date.

171
00:11:23,907 --> 00:11:25,898
[Illyria]
Angel does not think...

172
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:29,501
the casualties of this creature
are important enough to avenge.

173
00:11:29,613 --> 00:11:33,777
I think corporate living's
made him lose his love for the hunt.

174
00:11:33,884 --> 00:11:36,751
No worries.
More for me then.

175
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:41,088
[Illyria]
It does not serve his interest.

176
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:44,691
What are you on about?

177
00:11:44,795 --> 00:11:47,889
I've seen this before
with many rulers.

178
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:52,094
- Your leader has been corrupted.
<i>- Hey. Hang on.</i>

179
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:54,466
In the first place,
Angel's not my leader.

180
00:11:54,571 --> 00:11:57,199
And in the second, what the bloody hell
do you mean, "corrupted"?

181
00:11:57,307 --> 00:12:00,174
It always begins the same.

182
00:12:00,277 --> 00:12:03,940
A ruler turns a blind eye to the dealings
or battles from which he cannot gain...

183
00:12:04,047 --> 00:12:07,210
<i>and a deaf ear to the counsel</i>
<i>of those closest to him.</i>

184
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:10,878
As his strength increases, so does
the separation between him and his follow...

185
00:12:10,987 --> 00:12:13,285
Shh.

186
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,689
- You smell that?
- The odors of everything in this world of men...

187
00:12:16,793 --> 00:12:19,057
are equally repugnant
to me.

188
00:12:19,162 --> 00:12:21,289
Bloody helpful.

189
00:12:25,402 --> 00:12:29,099
You're wrong about Angel.
[Sighs]

190
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,300
Not that I don't think the sod could end up
being a megalomaniacal bastard...

191
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:35,139
it's just if he did,
I'd know it.

192
00:12:36,246 --> 00:12:38,214
I'd feel it.

193
00:12:38,315 --> 00:12:40,476
[Illyria]
You'll have proof soon enough.

194
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:43,018
A corrupted ruler
on such a path...

195
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,953
sees treachery and betrayal
all around him.

196
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:49,924
He cannot suffer intimates.
He will eventually turn against them.

197
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:52,324
[Chuckles]
Guess I don't have to worry about that...

198
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:54,989
'cause Angel and me
have never been intimate.

199
00:12:55,098 --> 00:12:57,828
- Except that one...
- Mark me.

200
00:12:57,934 --> 00:12:59,902
He will murder
one of you.

201
00:13:00,003 --> 00:13:02,164
<i>Actually...</i>

202
00:13:02,272 --> 00:13:04,570
he already has.

203
00:13:04,674 --> 00:13:07,006
Drogyn.

204
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,978
- Who is this?
- The guardian of the Deeper Well.

205
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,345
<i>- [Gasping]</i>
- Greenskeeper of your graveyard, so to speak.

206
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,475
My jailer.

207
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:17,485
- Illyria.
- Boretz.

208
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:19,782
[Growling]

209
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,085
[Grunts]

210
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:30,629
Stay away from its mouth.
Its bite is poisonous.

211
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:32,702
<i>Go for its knees.!</i>

212
00:13:32,802 --> 00:13:34,997
I think there's a weak spot...

213
00:13:36,306 --> 00:13:39,469
Okay. Yeah.
That might do it.

214
00:13:40,911 --> 00:13:45,348
Drogyn. What the hell
are you doing here?

215
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:49,009
<i>Don't give me your "Ask me no questions,</i>
<i>I'll tell you no lies"bugaboo.</i>

216
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,781
- I came to find you.
- Oh, so you tacked up a sign on your tree...

217
00:13:51,888 --> 00:13:53,856
waved bye to the Keeblers,
hopped the puddle...

218
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:56,357
and managed to sniff me out
in a city of ten million.

219
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:59,451
I can find anyone
who's visited the well...

220
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:01,793
be they in this world
or any other.

221
00:14:01,898 --> 00:14:06,232
- [Gasps] I came to... to warn you.
- Warn me?

222
00:14:07,837 --> 00:14:09,998
- He's bleeding.
- You're all torn up, mate.

223
00:14:10,106 --> 00:14:12,370
- [Gasping]
- What did this to you? The Boretz, was it?

224
00:14:12,475 --> 00:14:16,241
No.
It was Angel.

225
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:41,566
<i>That'd look good</i>
<i>on a calf.</i>

226
00:14:41,671 --> 00:14:44,504
- Pardon?
- Thinking of getting a tattoo, right?

227
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:49,307
Put a little more bad in your bad-boy bank.
It should go on your calf.

228
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:56,208
Angel, something unusual
came across one of my...

229
00:14:56,319 --> 00:14:59,652
<i>Oh, I... didn't realize</i>
<i>you were occupied.</i>

230
00:14:59,756 --> 00:15:01,724
If you don't mind,
Hamilton...

231
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:04,225
Actually, Wes, we're... kind of
in the middle of something.

232
00:15:06,162 --> 00:15:08,494
Why don't you try me later?

233
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,197
- Yes. Later then.
- Hey, Wes?

234
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:18,201
Shut the door
on your way out.

235
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,935
Hey.
Is Angel in there?

236
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:25,208
- He is.
- What's the weather report?

237
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:28,682
Cold. Icy, actually.

238
00:15:28,785 --> 00:15:31,754
Well, he cut six of my clients loose.
Didn't even tell me.

239
00:15:31,855 --> 00:15:35,120
I spent all day talking them off ledges
and off of pill bottles.

240
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,991
I sense that suicidal celebrities
are beneath Angel's concern.

241
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:41,689
These are very pretty people
I'm talking about here, Wes.

242
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:43,925
Four of'em getting in shape
for <i>Young Guns III.</i>

243
00:15:44,034 --> 00:15:46,093
- What'd he say?
- Nothing.

244
00:15:46,202 --> 00:15:48,170
He and Hamilton are in his office.

245
00:15:48,271 --> 00:15:50,501
- They're discussing business strategy.
- Hamilton?

246
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:53,303
Looks like Angel suddenly started
channeling Leona Helmsley.

247
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,675
- He's not himself, at any rate.
- What's happening to him?

248
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,977
<i>- [Phone Rings]</i>
- Yes?

249
00:16:01,151 --> 00:16:03,119
Spike.

250
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,154
It was a Sathari...

251
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,554
part of a clan
of demon assassins.

252
00:16:08,658 --> 00:16:11,024
They fell upon me
last night.

253
00:16:11,127 --> 00:16:16,690
The poison from his four blades
wearing heavy on my limbs...

254
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,860
Yeah. Rousing bit of rah-rah, mate.
Get to the goods.

255
00:16:21,971 --> 00:16:25,873
Once I bested him, I tortured
the Sathari for hours...

256
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:28,842
until he confessed
who had sent him.

257
00:16:30,313 --> 00:16:32,304
It was Angel.

258
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:35,851
Tell 'em why.

259
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:39,251
He said Angel was afraid
I'd find something in the Deeper Well...

260
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,654
something that would uncover
the truth about his involvement.

261
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,197
- In what?
- Helping Illyria escape from her tomb.

262
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:56,234
I thought the release of her sarcophagus
from the Deeper Well was predestined.

263
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:59,604
- Yeah. What about that bit?
- That's what I thought at the time...

264
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:01,734
but now I believe...

265
00:17:01,845 --> 00:17:05,144
Illyria's resurrection
may have been planned.

266
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:08,240
- By Angel.
- Oh, that doesn't make a lick of sense.

267
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,319
Why would Angel
want to spring an Old One?

268
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,912
- I don't think that was the point.
- Then what was?

269
00:17:14,023 --> 00:17:16,719
Before he died,
the assassin said something about a sacrifice.

270
00:17:19,162 --> 00:17:21,756
Someone... trusted and dear.

271
00:17:21,865 --> 00:17:23,833
Are you saying...

272
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:26,766
that Angel was responsible for
what happened to Fred?

273
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,703
I mean, he may not have...
chosen her specifically, but...

274
00:17:29,806 --> 00:17:33,105
<i>Whoa.! Let's put a kibosh on that sentence</i>
<i>before it turns into an ass-kickin'</i>

275
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:35,677
Do you think
I gain pleasure in this?

276
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:38,907
I held Angel an ally,
a brother.

277
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:42,542
And you believe...
he may have murdered Fred.

278
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,486
I know this is difficult
for you, but Angel was involved.

279
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:51,787
The information
retrieved from the assassin...

280
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:55,456
- You ever think he was lyin'?
- No one lies when they're
at the mercy of my wrath.

281
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:58,227
- Then you're the liar, Aragorn.
- He has to tell the truth.

282
00:17:58,334 --> 00:18:01,030
- It's a curse or something.
- How can we be sure? We don't know this guy.

283
00:18:01,137 --> 00:18:03,230
Gunn, this is Drogyn
the Battlebrand...

284
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:06,399
given eternal youth
a thousand years ago.

285
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:08,943
Demon bane, truth-sayer...

286
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:11,809
Watchers Council.

287
00:18:11,915 --> 00:18:13,883
Percy did a paper.
Bully for him.

288
00:18:15,084 --> 00:18:18,952
Drogyn, any idea
what this symbol means?

289
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:22,650
- No.
- Where'd you get that?

290
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:26,320
This afternoon, someone tapped
into the template interface...

291
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:29,159
sent a message to me,
and that symbol.

292
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:31,927
- Somebody's dropping clues.
- Playing games is more like it.

293
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:35,129
Put me on the short bus, but I still can't
wrap my head around the notion...

294
00:18:35,238 --> 00:18:37,468
that Angel had anything
to do with Fred, or any of this.

295
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,202
Angel's been doing a number of things
out of character lately.

296
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,575
- We all noticed it.
- Yeah, but why is this happening now?

297
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,648
Why the change?

298
00:18:45,748 --> 00:18:50,208
Yes, why the sudden need
to tie up loose ends like Drogyn?

299
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,982
- Unless...
- He's preparing to make his move.

300
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:55,455
What kind of move
we talking about?

301
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:59,426
There's only one way
to find out. We ask him.

302
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:04,967
- Drogyn should stay here, under guard.
- I'm not missing the fireworks.

303
00:19:05,068 --> 00:19:08,936
Hey, Illyria. You don't... care about
any of this nonsense, do you?

304
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:12,371
The intricacies of your fates
are meaningless.

305
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:14,807
Well and good. You mind watchin' over
our friend Drogyn?

306
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:17,209
Aw, come on.
New place will do you good.

307
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:20,180
It's nice and cozy.
Help yourself to some beer in the fridge.

308
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:23,582
Switch on the telly
if you get bored, and, uh...

309
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:25,654
feel free to play a little
<i>Crash Bandicoot.</i>

310
00:19:25,755 --> 00:19:27,655
Give you lot
something to pass the time.

311
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,151
<i>- [Door Closes]</i>
<i>- Crash Bandicoot?</i>

312
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:40,734
Strike these four clauses and wire it back
to them. See what they make of that.

313
00:19:40,837 --> 00:19:44,500
- Yeah. See what they make of that.
- Angel?

314
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:49,178
- Long dinner?
- We need to talk to you.

315
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:51,509
- Now.
- Boy's dead serious.

316
00:19:56,586 --> 00:19:58,554
Are you comin' then?

317
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,593
Okay, what's on your minds?

318
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:09,824
- The question is, what's on yours?
- Our friend Drogyn's in town.

319
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:13,835
- Is he?
- Yep. Bit marked up though.

320
00:20:13,937 --> 00:20:17,930
Somebody tried to have him killed.
Know anything about that?

321
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:22,171
Of course not.
Where is he?

322
00:20:22,278 --> 00:20:24,246
- He's safe.
- Good.

323
00:20:24,347 --> 00:20:26,645
Now, can we get
back to business?

324
00:20:26,749 --> 00:20:28,740
Or was there something else?

325
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:32,514
"Business." What "business"
are we in, Angel?

326
00:20:32,622 --> 00:20:35,250
Do I really have to
explain this to you people?

327
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:37,849
We're in the business
of business.

328
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:40,930
Oil, software, Worldwide Wickets...
The product doesn't matter.

329
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,467
It's the game that matters. Get to the top,
be the best, have the most, win.

330
00:20:45,568 --> 00:20:49,060
- Win <i>what?</i>
- You're still missing the point.

331
00:20:49,172 --> 00:20:53,268
That Angel talkin'? 'Cause it sounds
a lot more like Angelus.

332
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:57,312
Oh, if I were Angelus, half of you would
already be dead, just for the fun of it.

333
00:20:57,413 --> 00:21:00,871
One of us already is.
We havin' fun yet?

334
00:21:02,085 --> 00:21:04,053
You wanna know the truth?

335
00:21:04,153 --> 00:21:07,281
The truth is there's only one of us
who ever understood how things really work.

336
00:21:08,658 --> 00:21:10,785
- Lorne.
- Whoa. Hey, h-hey.

337
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:13,555
Can I not be the poster child
for your nervous breakdown here?

338
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:18,794
You didn't judge. You didn't spend your life
obsessed with good and evil.

339
00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:21,461
You do that, you get swallowed...
lost in the minutiae.

340
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,438
Good, bad, Angel, Angelus...
None of it makes a difference.

341
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,735
I wish it did, but...

342
00:21:26,843 --> 00:21:30,506
You know, an ant with the best intentions
or the most diabolical schemes...

343
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:32,581
is just exactly an ant.

344
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:36,948
And there is one thing
in this business...

345
00:21:37,053 --> 00:21:40,784
in this apocalypse that we call a world
that matters... power.

346
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,858
Power tips the scale.
Power sets the course.

347
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:47,760
And until I have real power...
global power... I have nothing.

348
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:49,832
I accomplish nothing.

349
00:21:49,932 --> 00:21:55,666
- And how you get this power...
<i>- Isn't pretty. Isn't fun.</i>

350
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,502
You think it's Wolfram and Hart
getting to me here...

351
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:03,671
and maybe you're right, because
they've shown us what power is.

352
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,010
From day one, they've been
callin' the shots...

353
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:08,709
and all we've done
is get shot at.

354
00:22:08,818 --> 00:22:10,786
I have a chance
to change that.

355
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:13,082
And will you?

356
00:22:13,189 --> 00:22:17,182
I mean, not to play an old saw,
but power does traditionally corrupt.

357
00:22:17,293 --> 00:22:19,261
I mean, you get
high up enough, and...

358
00:22:19,362 --> 00:22:21,626
well, the people,
they do start to look like ants.

359
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:23,666
I can't worry about that.

360
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:24,690
I can't worry about that.

361
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,702
- The small stuff.
- Angel?

362
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:31,171
That important phone call from...
that guy about that thing...

363
00:22:31,274 --> 00:22:33,401
It's on line three.

<i>I have to take this.</i>

<i>[Spike]</i>
<i>Yeah. "The guy about the thing."</i>

366
00:22:47,423 --> 00:22:52,486
The "small stuff'
that you can't worry about?

367
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:56,725
- Would that include Fred?
- I loved Fred.

368
00:22:56,833 --> 00:23:00,166
- That's not an answer.
- Then I guess you don't get one.

369
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:08,337
There's got to be something...
behind all this.

370
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:12,214
A reason.

371
00:23:15,384 --> 00:23:17,352
It could be a ploy.

372
00:23:19,122 --> 00:23:23,252
- For God's sake, say something.
- What would you like me to say?

373
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:25,589
Tell you that Angel
loved Fred...

374
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:29,096
and that in an eon of eons
he would never harm her in any way?

375
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,801
I wish I could, Wes.

376
00:23:32,902 --> 00:23:37,532
But if he believes what he's saying,
and I believe he does...

377
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,234
Doesn't make any sense.

378
00:23:40,343 --> 00:23:43,244
Angel never cared
about power.

379
00:23:43,346 --> 00:23:47,339
Well, he's never had any
to care about, has he?

380
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,318
Not real power,
even as Angelus.

381
00:23:52,622 --> 00:23:55,022
And then just like that,
he's king of the mountain.

382
00:23:56,225 --> 00:23:58,819
It's quite a view
from up there.

383
00:23:58,928 --> 00:24:01,089
Tends to make people
want things.

384
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:05,031
Even if they start
with the... best intentions.

385
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,394
Angel's seen real power and...

386
00:24:09,505 --> 00:24:11,473
he's not lookin' away.

387
00:24:11,574 --> 00:24:13,565
He's gonna go for it, Wes.

- I need you to be out of here.
- It's typical.

your entire family out of the country.

No, wait. That's actually
not that typical at all.

You couldn't just...
not call?

00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,274
- It's not safe here.
- Is it ever?

403

I wanna be with you
if there's trouble.

00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:32,253
You don't wanna be with me.
You don't wanna be near me.

405
00:25:32,355 --> 00:25:36,086
- Because I might get hurt?
- Because I'm the thing that'll hurt you.

I wanna be with you?

00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:58,036
Down here, it's the players in the circle
that make things happen.

491
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,115
Hell, you... you get tapped
by one of them...

492
00:31:00,216 --> 00:31:02,514
that's kinda like gettin' the keys
to the chocolate factory.

493
00:31:02,618 --> 00:31:07,578
That's why you came back
to L.A., tried to kill Angel...

494
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:13,384
to get into the circle.

495
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:18,429
To be a Black Thorn is to be
the senior partners' instrument on Earth.

496
00:31:18,534 --> 00:31:20,559
Doesn't get bigger than that.

497
00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:22,728
Looks like Angel succeeded
where you failed.

498
00:31:22,838 --> 00:31:25,932
- He doesn't have it in him.
- Doesn't have what in him?

499
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:28,908
Well, for starters, he's got to give up
the champion angle...

500
00:31:29,011 --> 00:31:31,639
quit savin' girls in alleys.

501
00:31:31,747 --> 00:31:35,080
Probably wouldn't even...
make it on the circle's radar...

502
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,209
till he killed
one of his lieutenants.

503
00:31:41,991 --> 00:31:44,221
The senior partners,
the circle...

504
00:31:44,326 --> 00:31:46,556
They're killing Angel
by degrees.

505
00:31:48,564 --> 00:31:50,794
And we all watched it happen.

506
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:54,699
Guy I knew wouldn't want this...
wouldn't wanna be this.

507
00:31:56,905 --> 00:32:01,433
Angel dedicated his life
to helping others.

508
00:32:01,543 --> 00:32:04,979
Not because he had to,
but because it was a path he'd chosen.

509
00:32:08,851 --> 00:32:13,254
If he's been swayed from that...
influenced...

510
00:32:15,157 --> 00:32:17,125
then maybe
there's still time.

511
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,717
We can bring him back.

512
00:32:19,828 --> 00:32:23,559
He'd do the same for any of us,
regardless of our actions.

513
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:27,500
Yeah, but what if he's skipped too far
down that evil brick road?

Embrace this worthy son.

00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:07,267

it was gonna happen?

531
00:34:12,307 --> 00:34:15,538
And how about that lamb we got you
for the slaughter? Any idea who that was?

532
00:34:15,644 --> 00:34:18,670
- Drogyn the Battlebrand.
- Damn straight.

533
00:34:18,781 --> 00:34:23,582
We got you some supercharged warrior juice,
not some schmuck. You must feel great.

Okay. Let me introduce you
around to a few people.

Some of these folks you know,
some you don't.

Of course, you're acquainted
with the archduke.

537
00:34:33,996 --> 00:34:35,964
Kudos, child.

538
00:34:36,064 --> 00:34:39,295
I must say, it's gratifying to see
you've returned to form, Angelus.

539
00:34:39,401 --> 00:34:44,429
- It's still Angel.
- Ah. Well, what's in a name, eh?

<i>In the spirit</i>
<i>of our new alliance...</i>

541
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:48,709
you must allow me to throw
a dinner party in your honor.

542
00:34:48,811 --> 00:34:53,373
- You know how I love parties.
- It's nice to see you again so soon, Angel.

543
00:34:53,482 --> 00:34:58,647
Senator. I had no idea
you were so well-connected.

544
00:34:58,754 --> 00:35:00,915
Well, I'm not gonna take
the White House in 2008...

545
00:35:01,023 --> 00:35:04,686
on just my sparkling wit
and funding from hostile governments.

546
00:35:04,793 --> 00:35:08,627
- [Laughs]
- [Laughs] I expect not.

547
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:13,064
Excuse us, Helen. Angel, I've got someone
here who would like to pay his respects.

548
00:35:13,168 --> 00:35:16,763
- Vail.
- You've been looking for me.

it was all good.

And for what? To get in bed
with the Circle of the Black Thorn?

567
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,820
So you figured it out.

568
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:50,660
Yeah, a little singin'
from a jailbird we know and loathe.

Lindsey.

- Doesn't have a reason to lie.

- Unlike you?

Kill us? Hard to believe we're
having trouble trusting you.

00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:13,950
- Just telling it like it is.
- Then we have a problem.

<i>Involvare.</i>

584
00:37:51,326 --> 00:37:54,227
All right.
We have six minutes.

585

- Till what?
- The glamour collapses.

586
00:37:56,331 --> 00:37:59,129
As far as anyone outside is concerned,
we're still at each other's throats.

587
00:37:59,234 --> 00:38:01,930
- Aren't we?
- We don't have a lot of time,
so I'm gonna make this short.

588
00:38:02,037 --> 00:38:05,302
Everything you <i>think</i> you know,
everything you've heard... is a lie.

589
00:38:05,407 --> 00:38:08,103
- Why should we believe you?
- Because I'm the one who told it.

590
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,940
- Read any good books lately?
<i>- You</i> sent us the message?

591
00:38:11,046 --> 00:38:13,981
- And the assassin to kill Drogyn.
- So that part was true.

592
00:38:14,082 --> 00:38:16,880
I knew Drogyn could handle himself.
I told the assassin just enough...

593
00:38:16,985 --> 00:38:19,681
to lead Drogyn to think I played a part
in resurrecting Illyria.

594
00:38:19,788 --> 00:38:21,949
I figured he'd come here
lookin' for allies against me.

595
00:38:22,057 --> 00:38:23,957
Why would you want us
to believe you killed Fred?

596
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:26,687
- Because <i>they</i> needed to believe it.
- The Black Thorn.

597
00:38:26,795 --> 00:38:29,855
They needed to believe my own
people didn't trust me anymore.

598
00:38:29,965 --> 00:38:34,959
They needed to believe a person as good and
as pure as Drogyn considered me an enemy.

599
00:38:36,505 --> 00:38:39,770
It was the only way
to gain their confidence.

600
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:43,902
Oh, so this whole Evil Angel
thing's been a big scamola.

601
00:38:44,012 --> 00:38:45,980
Huh. I smell Oscar.

602
00:38:46,081 --> 00:38:52,020
- When did this all start?
- Two months ago, with a kiss.

603
00:38:53,689 --> 00:38:57,147
<i>- Though it didn't hit me till later that night.</i>
- [Gasps]

604
00:39:00,896 --> 00:39:02,955
Cordelia gave you her visions.

605
00:39:03,065 --> 00:39:05,533
One-shot deal.

606
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:11,470
She put me on the path,
showed me where the real powers are.

607
00:39:11,573 --> 00:39:13,700
But I couldn't see
who they were.

608
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:19,577
And then Fred died, and I wasn't going to
let that be another random, horrible event...

609
00:39:19,681 --> 00:39:22,445
in another random,
horrible world.

610
00:39:22,551 --> 00:39:24,519
So I decided to use it...

611
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:27,179
to make her death matter.

612
00:39:28,423 --> 00:39:32,018
<i>And it worked.</i>
<i>I'm in.</i>

613
00:39:34,362 --> 00:39:39,197
I've seen the faces of evil. I know who
the real powers in the apocalypse are.

614
00:39:39,301 --> 00:39:42,429
So all that
"power tilts the scales" crap...

615
00:39:42,537 --> 00:39:44,630
It's true.
We're in a machine.

616
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,470
That machine's gonna be here
long after our bodies are dust.

617
00:39:47,576 --> 00:39:51,910
The senior partners will always exist in one
form or another because mankind is weak.

618
00:39:52,013 --> 00:39:53,708
Do you want me to point
my crossbow at him...

619
00:39:53,815 --> 00:39:55,715
'cause I think he's gonna
start talkin' about ants again.

620
00:39:55,817 --> 00:39:57,614
<i>We</i> are weak.

621
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:01,780
The powerful
control everything...

622
00:40:03,024 --> 00:40:05,458
except our will to choose.

623
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,358
Look, Lindsey's a pathetic half-wit,
but he was right about one thing.

624
00:40:08,463 --> 00:40:10,488
Heroes don't accept
the way the world is.

625
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:14,194
The senior partners may be eternal,
but we can make their existence painful.

626
00:40:14,302 --> 00:40:16,702
You wanna take them on?

627
00:40:16,805 --> 00:40:20,002
We're in a machine.
The Black Thorn runs it.

628
00:40:20,108 --> 00:40:23,737
We can bring their gears to a grinding halt,
even if it's just for a moment.

629
00:40:23,845 --> 00:40:25,403
'Bout time we got
our hands dirty.

630
00:40:25,514 --> 00:40:27,948
This isn't a "keep fighting
the good fight" kind of a deal.

631
00:40:28,049 --> 00:40:30,643
<i>Let's be clear.</i>

632
00:40:30,752 --> 00:40:35,018
I'm talking about killing
every... single... member...

633
00:40:35,123 --> 00:40:37,091
of the Black Thorn.

634
00:40:40,495 --> 00:40:45,455
- We don't walk away from that.
- Do we crawl away at least?

635
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:48,092
We do this, the senior partners
will rain their full wrath.

636
00:40:48,203 --> 00:40:50,171
They'll make an example of us.

637
00:40:50,272 --> 00:40:53,571
I'm talkin' full-on hell, not the basic
fire-and-brimstone kind we're used to.

638
00:40:53,675 --> 00:40:56,235
- We know the drill.
<i>- No, you don't.</i>

639
00:40:56,344 --> 00:40:58,676
Ten to one, we're gone
when the smoke clears.

640
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:03,274
They will do everything
in their power to destroy us.

641
00:41:04,853 --> 00:41:08,345
So... I need you to be sure.

642
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:12,258
Power endures.

643
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,592
We can't bring down the senior partners,
but for one bright, shiny moment...

644
00:41:16,698 --> 00:41:19,462
we can show them
that they don't own us.

645
00:41:19,568 --> 00:41:22,935
You need to decide
for yourselves...

646
00:41:23,038 --> 00:41:25,199
if that's worth dying for.

647
00:41:25,307 --> 00:41:27,502
<i>I can't order you</i>
<i>to do this.</i>

648
00:41:29,878 --> 00:41:31,846
Can't do it without ya.

649
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:40,713
So we'll vote...
as a team.

650
00:41:43,725 --> 00:41:46,523
Think about
what I'm askin' you to do.
