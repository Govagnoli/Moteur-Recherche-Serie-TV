1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:03,120
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:05,830
- I'm Lilah Morgan.
- Wolfram & Hart.

3
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:10,630
I'm an associate here.
We're all pleased you're here, Darla.

4
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:15,919
- I can't believe you're here.
- Let Darla take care of you.

5
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:19,000
All you have to do is let me.

6
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,090
Exciting, isn't it?

7
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,530
Darla.

8
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,040
I didn't see you.

9
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,859
Going through their things.
The hidden pieces of themselves...

10
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:15,040
...locked up, giving you
a thrill of control.

11
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,099
I keep up with his latest project.

12
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,629
He's probably in my office right now.

13
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,319
That's just how it works at our firm.

14
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,849
All you busy little worker bees,
plotting your little schemes.

15
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,650
Calynthia powder?

16
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,370
That's how you keep Angel sleeping
when he's with you?

17
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:42,920
There's nothing so lovely as dreams.
Everything's in them.

18
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:45,359
Everything hidden.

19
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,780
Open those chambers,
you'll truly understand someone...

20
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,959
...and control them.

21
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,719
And what's hidden
in Angel's secret chambers?

22
00:01:58,329 --> 00:01:59,379
Horrors.

23
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,510
- That's typical of your type.
- At least I'm not a sheep.

24
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:11,360
- I'm not a sheep!
- You've never had a single opinion...

25
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,219
- ...You didn't read.
- At least I read.

26
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,419
Don't even try it.
I was top 10 percent of my class.

27
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,460
What class? "Advanced Bosoms"?

28
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,110
Hey! What the hell's going on here?

29
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,340
We were discussing whether or not
we should pay Gunn.

30
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,659
- No, you weren't.
- Our discussions last three minutes.

31
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:39,379
- Then it's strictly name-calling.
- Ebenezer doesn't want to share.

32
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,879
I merely said Gunn
might be insulted by the offer.

33
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:47,919
- He's a proud sort of fellow.
- He's been helping. He should be paid.

34
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,530
- I'll think about it.
- No think. Pay.

35
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,060
How about we pretend
that you work for me?

36
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,870
- You're so unpleasant when--
- Let's pretend that you don't.

37
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,509
You can't fire me. I'm Vision Girl.

38
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:11,030
Okay, I'll think about asking him.
Maybe on a case-by-case.

39
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,349
- My hero.
- I was gonna suggest that.

40
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,229
Mm-hm.

41
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:20,770
- Is there coffee?
- In the morning. It's 10:00 at night.

42
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,949
I was disoriented.
I've been sleeping weird.

43
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,620
Weird how?

44
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:31,969
I don't know.

45
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,689
It's been like this for a bit.
You sleep more, you're less rested.

46
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,729
Are you dreaming?

47
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,219
Boys, I think we have a customer.

48
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,090
Okay, a girl. She's in an alley.

49
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:59,530
Hollywood and Wilcox.

50
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,189
- Oh, she's so scared.
- Go.

51
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:12,520
God, he's gonna be too late.

52
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,100
Why are you making us run around?

53
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,019
Hey, I get it first.
Think I want your seconds? You pig.

54
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,660
The guy's a pig.

55
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:50,079
- So what do we got here?
- You're not--

56
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:54,870
Get behind the tape. You wanna gawk,
go watch a high-speed chase on Fox.

57
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,810
- Keep the tourists away.
- But--

58
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,600
I'm out of Vice three weeks,
I come back to all this amateur crap.

59
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:07,300
Pretend you're not a Cub Scout
and tell me about this.

60
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,110
Well, detective, we had
to scrape him off the wall.

61
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,399
Guys got pinned by a two-ton dumpster.

62
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,740
- It fell on them?
- No, they were pinned to the wall.

63
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,879
Looks like somebody
shoved it from the side.

64
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,500
Have to be pretty strong.

65
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:30,879
You're telling me.
Splashed them all the way up here.

66
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:38,120
That's not their blood.

67
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,050
Excuse me?

68
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:45,350
You seen a girl tonight?
Maybe a little scared and beat up?

69
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,829
Nobody but our Mr. Bills.

70
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,110
You know, "Oh, no, Mr. Bill!"

71
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,110
Right.

72
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:02,329
So, what do we got here?

73
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,639
Hey.

74
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:27,759
What do you want?

75
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,139
- You're bleeding.
- Stay away from me.

76
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,899
- I just wanna ask you a few questions.
- You don't understand.

77
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:41,339
I'm really upset right now,
and I think it's best if you just--

78
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,120
- You were in that alley, weren't you?
- No! I mean....

79
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:47,279
What alley?

80
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:49,670
- I'm going.
- Hold on a second.

81
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:58,740
Oh, God! I told you.
I tried to tell you.

82
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,500
Please wait.

83
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,199
What are you?

84
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:18,540
I've come to help you.
My name is Angel.

85
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:23,589
I stabbed an angel.
Now I'll never get into heaven.

86
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,149
I'm not an angel. It's just a name.

87
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:29,870
But how did you--?

88
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,200
Well, I'm different
from most people, like you are.

89
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,940
Those men in the alley,
they tried to hurt you, didn't they?

90
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:47,659
- But you stopped them.
- I didn't mean to. They followed me.

91
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:50,379
- It wasn't--
- It's okay.

92
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:54,720
- Yeah, it's just great.
- You're not from L.A., are you?

93
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,649
You got family in town?

94
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:01,610
Me neither.

95
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:06,649
Town kind of attracts loners,
don't you think?

96
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,860
You can't make me go
anywhere with you.

97
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:14,240
I think that message got through.

98
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:17,070
I would never try.

99
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:19,820
Wait.

100
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,730
Take this.

101
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,269
If you need anything,
a place to stay....

102
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:29,940
- I'm staying with a friend.
- Someone to talk to.

103
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:32,279
Think about it.

104
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:35,139
I won't hurt you...

105
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:38,029
...and you can't hurt me.

106
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:41,309
You may need that.

107
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,990
Okay, maybe she can hurt me a little.

108
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,759
- Bethany.
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.

109
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,470
I was starting to get worried.

110
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:27,509
So how was the club? You have any fun?

111
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,529
- It was okay.
- Any cute boys?

112
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:37,740
Sorry I didn't go. Work got insane.
Our new clients are monsters.

113
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,889
- Here, let me.
- Oh, I like folding.

114
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,409
It's like a Zen exercise.
It levels me out.

115
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:48,190
You've gotta let me help.
I've gotta at least--

116
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:50,909
It's enough, you letting me stay.

117
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:54,889
Didn't we vow you'd stop that?
Didn't we make a blood oath?

118
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,429
I love having you here.

119
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:04,240
You know, when you came
and spoke at our school, I was so:

120
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,429
"There was someone who got out,
made it by themselves."

121
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,419
- I'm saying it wrong. I--
- No, you're not.

122
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:17,769
I couldn't believe
you even talked to me.

123
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:21,679
See, you have no idea.
You're special, Bethany.

124
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,320
In the non-retarded sense of the word.

125
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:30,179
You think I tour high schools
saying "look me up" to everyone I meet?

126
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,440
You have a power about you.

127
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,039
Other people will start to know that.

128
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:43,350
- I guess I'm getting kind of sleepy.
- I bet you are.

129
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,399
I'm still kind of wired.
I might stare at the TV for a while.

130
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,879
Good night, Lilah.

131
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,179
Sweet dreams.

132
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:00,950
I can't get this bandage to....
Stop moving.

133
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,179
- I'm not.
- Then stop breathing.

134
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:04,769
I don't breathe.

135
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,240
Then stop flexing your manly
boob muscles, or whatever.

136
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,059
- That's an ugly wound.
- Doesn't feel pretty.

137
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,419
We should approach her with caution.
I guess you already figured that out.

138
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,159
She's very powerful.
We must find out all we can.

139
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,289
- Like oh, say, her name?
- I was impaled at the time.

140
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:29,259
Of course. Perfectly understandable.

141
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:34,299
You know how hard it is to think
straight with a rebar in your torso?

142
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,610
Actually, I do.
Benefits of a Sunnydale education.

143
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:42,240
- No address or anything?
- She's staying with a friend.

144
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,580
Where do we keep the list
of "people with friends"?

145
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,139
She's not local. Traces of an accent.
Northeast. Maybe Ohio.

146
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:54,179
Everything about her says
she's on the run.

147
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:58,549
- Look into northeastern runaways.
- Crossed with supernatural events.

148
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,799
The way she is, she's not low-profile.

149
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,539
Angel, you sure this isn't
a demon of some kind?

150
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:09,419
- She's just a girl.
- One that could kill you by blinking.

151
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,129
She needs help.
She's out of control.

152
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:18,559
She's just lost.
What do we know about telekinesis?

153
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:24,419
Ah, yes. The power of
moving things with one's mind.

154
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,330
That's pretty much it.
The power of moving....

155
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,200
I'm better with demons, really.

156
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,809
Time to broaden your horizons.

157
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:43,269
You call, I come.
Loaded for bear, ready for battle....

158
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,809
- Any other "B" thing.
- What's that?

159
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,509
Isn't this the thing?
My camp kids put it together.

160
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,360
- I wanted to use it tonight.
- Men are all alike.

161
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,870
- Fair one, you still saving my life?
- Every minute.

162
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,700
- How's it going?
- You're alive, right?

163
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,820
What kind of scaly pus-monster
will I slay this time?

164
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:07,799
We need you to do legwork.

165
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,429
Legwork? That means
I can't use my cool new ax.

166
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:13,909
I'm trying to find a girl.

167
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:17,399
She smashed two rapists
with a dumpster.

168
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:20,610
- She must be hefty.
- We think she's psychic.

169
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:25,370
- Telekinesis: the power of moving--
- I have heard the word.

170
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,610
What should I do?

171
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:30,139
- Find out about the guys who got--
- Smooshed?

172
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,440
--near your neighborhood.
You think you can find them?

173
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,620
Sure. But if I return on
the end of a spatula...

174
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,980
...I'm expecting some
serious workman's comp.

175
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,870
See? Workman's comp.
He wants to get paid.

176
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,179
Cordelia--

177
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:47,509
The poor man can't even
afford a real ax!

178
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:49,100
Okay, okay.

179
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,090
Look, I'll bring it up.

180
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,919
I'm going to bed.
It's been a long day.

181
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,279
You've been up for three hours.

182
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,190
Cordelia....

183
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:04,659
Find the girl.

184
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:12,980
Shh, Rabbit.

185
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:20,110
Let's go downstairs. Just you and me.

186
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:28,220
Don't make a fuss, Rabbit.

187
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,769
- Bethany....
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

188
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,309
Don't. Don't go!

189
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,680
Remember, don't you?
In front of the fire...

190
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:17,809
...with the gypsy girl,
all bound and gagged.

191
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,880
We took her right there.

192
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,160
We sucked her blood till she was dry.

193
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:49,960
Well?

194
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,349
Top of the middle of the day
to you too.

195
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,500
No leads worth mentioning.

196
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:59,410
Of course, we lost time
during my hour of sleep.

197
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,539
Good thing I left clothes here,
or you'd smell me even now.

198
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:05,279
Gunn check in?

199
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,960
How about you? How's it coming?

200
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:12,859
Most of my reading suggests that
telekinesis is a psychic phenomenon...

201
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,710
...that occurs during
extreme emotional distress.

202
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:20,410
That tracks. We gotta find her.

203
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,880
Well, I think I may have a lead.

204
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,049
How are you?

205
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:42,299
Bethany. Bethany Chaulk.

206
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,680
You said I couldn't hurt you.

207
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,329
- That if I needed anything....
- You're safe here.

208
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,349
We're all safe people.

209
00:18:58,089 --> 00:19:01,990
This is Wesley and Cordelia.

210
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,109
So it's a family business, huh?

211
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,970
Friends. Come on in.

212
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,859
Sorry.

213
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,119
I'm just so tired.

214
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:29,240
- Would you like some tea?
- Yeah, please.

215
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,529
You shouldn't worry. Angel does
this kind of thing all the time.

216
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:40,150
Makes tea?

217
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:44,480
Helps people. You know,
he helps people with problems.

218
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:50,130
- So what's wrong with you?
- Where to begin?

219
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:57,609
Well, our little girl gave you
one heck of a shiner, didn't she?

220
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:00,440
Was the L.A. scenario too much?

221
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:03,970
I assure you, I have
the utmost confidence that--

222
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,900
Don't "utmost confidence" me.

223
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,710
Some might say you've lost
control of this girl.

224
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:14,519
If so, what happens when you
pull the trigger?

225
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:19,279
She has the profile. But an assassin's
no good if it can't be controlled.

226
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,680
But do you know what I say?

227
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,289
Nonsense.

228
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:28,609
I say Lilah Morgan found this girl...

229
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,390
...Lilah Morgan recruited
this girl for a reason...

230
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:34,750
...and Lilah Morgan's gonna
bring this girl...

231
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:38,380
...into the welcoming arms
of Wolfram & Hart.

232
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,819
I will find her.

233
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,079
Hello.

234
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,569
Bethany.

235
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:55,420
No, I am so glad you called.
I was worried.

236
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,450
No, I'm fine.

237
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,329
Where are you?

238
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:11,160
They're Cordy's. I feel kind of funny.

239
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,289
You look nice.

240
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:17,369
You get ahold of your friend?
Is she okay?

241
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,640
She says she's fine. Worried about me.

242
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:26,230
How do you explain...?
She'd just think I'm crazy.

243
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,480
- Are you?
- What?

244
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,970
Well, if you are, you know, crazy...

245
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,380
...I just think things will go
smoother if I know up front.

246
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,269
I probably am.

247
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,339
I don't wanna....

248
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:48,289
I don't wanna talk about me
and share, or whatever.

249
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,750
We can talk about stuff, but....

250
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:56,019
I don't know.
You're the expert, right?

251
00:21:56,529 --> 00:21:59,940
I wouldn't say that.
I just have experience in dealing...

252
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,259
...with the kind of power
that needs control.

253
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,680
I don't want to control it.
I want it gone.

254
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,660
- What is she doing?
- They're talking, yes?

255
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:20,150
There's something. She's got a vibe.
I'm getting a vibe. She's vibe-y.

256
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:22,250
I didn't notice a vibe.

257
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,839
All evidence to the contrary,
you're not a woman.

258
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:30,670
Women and sex. It's not like you guys.
We see more levels.

259
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,880
Are you even listening?

260
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:39,849
It's like there's a flash.
Like something pops in my brain.

261
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,190
And then...

262
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:46,029
...it's like there's an undertow,
like there's no gravity.

263
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,700
My body's being pulled
in different directions...

264
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:52,210
...but inside, you know?

265
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,009
Does it hurt?

266
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:58,309
Yes. No. Just for a second,
then I'm back.

267
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,490
You only feel it
when you make things move?

268
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:06,279
I don't make them move. When I come to,
things aren't where I left them.

269
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:10,210
- You've never done it on purpose?
- Of course not.

270
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:13,839
You never thought, "That remote's far.
I'd have to get up--"

271
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:16,109
It's not a parlor trick!

272
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,930
It's-- It's a disease.

273
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:23,970
We don't know what it is yet.
I just want to know about you.

274
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,339
Don't ask stupid questions.

275
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:30,039
"When were you potty-trained?
Name all your pets.

276
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,519
Do you like hide-and-seek?"

277
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:36,890
- They weren't on my list.
- You know nothing! I shouldn't be here.

278
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:42,500
I agree. She doesn't want our help.
Let's not waste our time with her.

279
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:45,859
- Wesley--
- There are people who need us...

280
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:49,000
...with graver issues
than impulse control.

281
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,319
- That's enough.
- Send her to her friend's.

282
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:56,720
Toss the furniture. Maybe we
should send you to your father.

283
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,690
- You sure nothing's broken?
- I'm sure.

284
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,180
Nothing at all? Say, your brain?

285
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:24,680
What happened to
"approach with caution" ?

286
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:27,130
If she'd gotten her defenses up--

287
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,059
She wouldn't be crying,
and you and Angel wouldn't be hurt.

288
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,299
What did you say?

289
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:37,140
- I mentioned her father.
- Well, who's her father?

290
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,740
The trauma that can
produce psychic power...

291
00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:44,440
...usually involves abuse
of some kind, early on.

292
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,130
You'd mentioned a sexual vibe.

293
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:50,650
She made that crack
about "family business."

294
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:54,460
Statistically speaking,
the father was the best guess.

295
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,279
There's not enough yuck in the world.

296
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:01,390
- How is she?
- Settling. You, go.

297
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:05,190
You can't fire him! I'll quit too!
Unless you're firm.

298
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,740
I'm not firing anyone.

299
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:11,579
My presence won't help her
trust issues. I'll be at my flat.

300
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,779
Call me if....

301
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,609
It helps that we know.

302
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:22,039
I hope so.

303
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,910
- Stay at your place, in case she--
- Be careful.

304
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,690
I doubt she'll go off again.

305
00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:42,650
There you are.

306
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:48,079
I came up here.

307
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:51,259
I feel safe up here.

308
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:56,829
You did pick the one room
that may collapse to feel safe in.

309
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:01,740
I'm really embarrassed.

310
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:04,490
And that just makes me....

311
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,819
Horrible things have happened,
been done to me.

312
00:26:10,329 --> 00:26:12,009
Guys have died...

313
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:16,099
...and I'm freaking
because I'm so embarrassed.

314
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,299
People are pathetic.

315
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,059
I don't know.

316
00:26:25,329 --> 00:26:26,769
I like them.

317
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:33,990
The time I've lived, I've seen
some horrors, scary behavior...

318
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:39,069
...and a couple of fashion trends
I constantly pray to forget.

319
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,589
But I see people try.

320
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:47,049
- I've seen them try to be better.
- You sound like an old guy.

321
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,289
Oh, you know, I'm very well-preserved.

322
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:56,970
I'd like that.
To see people the way you do.

323
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,019
- Darla?
- It's just me.

324
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,049
What's up?

325
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,009
What's--? Is there trouble?

326
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,940
I just didn't want to sleep.

327
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:55,279
I heard a voice in here
and thought maybe you were awake.

328
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,650
I was having a nightmare.

329
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:03,500
It looked like a pretty happy dream.
Or maybe the covers were just rumpled.

330
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:09,180
I figured I'd come in.
It's nicer than my room.

331
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,700
Is there something
you wanted to talk about?

332
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,880
No.

333
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,609
I figured we'd have fun.

334
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:21,750
You can do stuff to me
and, you know...

335
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,900
- ...we'll have some fun.
- That's not gonna happen.

336
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:31,559
Like I'm some frightened little mouse?
I've done stuff.

337
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,180
I can make you happy.

338
00:28:35,529 --> 00:28:38,019
You wouldn't like me when I'm happy.

339
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,930
- Come on.
- It won't mean anything.

340
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:45,190
- I said stop it.
- Get off me!

341
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:52,000
You wanna make love,
but not be touched?

342
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:55,210
"Make love"?
Are you from the 18th century?

343
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:02,579
- I was just.... I just wanted--
- What did you want?

344
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:08,259
- Are you shocked I'm a great big slut?
- You'll find I'm not easily shocked.

345
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:16,450
Everyone thinks I'm so fragile
and innocent. Men love it.

346
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:20,089
- Do you?
- Do I love it?

347
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:21,930
Who cares?

348
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,759
I'm like the chambermaid.

349
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,099
I just leave.

350
00:29:31,329 --> 00:29:33,220
When a guy's on me, I....

351
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:37,880
I made up the room, I showed him in...

352
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:40,740
...and I leave till he's gone.

353
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,990
Come back and clean up the mess.

354
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,759
And the men?

355
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:55,519
You think they'd notice
or care I'm not there?

356
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,259
Would you?

357
00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:04,029
- Everyone's not as bad as you think.
- Oh, right. You love the people.

358
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:09,890
You love them so much you've got
100 rooms to be alone in.

359
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:16,559
I'm thinking maybe you're not
exactly qualified to help me.

360
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,289
Maybe I'm the only one who is.

361
00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:26,440
- Try to get some sleep.
- Who's Darla?

362
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:29,630
Good night, Bethany.

363
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:46,180
He's not sleeping,

364
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:49,640
- It puts a cramp in Lindsey's project.
- Yes, but--

365
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:52,319
Lindsey understands the big picture.

366
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:55,710
All his efforts
go towards that picture.

367
00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:58,539
Your girl is messing up his efforts.

368
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,289
- I understand, sir.
- I know you do.

369
00:31:02,289 --> 00:31:05,619
Get her out. Not just for the sake
of the big picture.

370
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,269
For yours.

371
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,950
I feel funny. Sweaty funny, I think.

372
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,309
Just try. You can always stop.

373
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:21,299
- What if it blows up?
- I'll buy Cordelia a new one.

374
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:26,170
Okay. Just drop it on the floor.

375
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:45,940
See?

376
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,690
You can control it.

377
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,200
Nice look.

378
00:31:58,089 --> 00:32:00,089
Gunn wants you to meet him here.

379
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:04,460
- Brentwood?
- I'll watch Bethany. We can shop.

380
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,299
Sure. Sounds like fun.

381
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,019
I'll be back soon.

382
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,759
You're not gonna wear this?

383
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:18,329
Knock, knock! This works great.
You break, I enter.

384
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:23,660
- If he's still alive, I can't enter.
- Guy's on the critical list.

385
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,609
You see what I'm seeing?

386
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:31,390
- Doesn't fit the thug profile.
- No. I hear he was muscle for hire.

387
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:34,960
- So he was sent.
- Somebody wanted her hurt.

388
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,960
Or wanted to see what would happen.

389
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,589
Look for an address book.
Checks, statements.

390
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:44,559
I'm still dealing with this
ugly living room.

391
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:48,509
- Some people shouldn't have money.
- About money...

392
00:32:49,089 --> 00:32:51,690
...how would you feel maybe...

393
00:32:52,089 --> 00:32:54,049
...on a case-by-case basis...?

394
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:58,289
- Are you offering to pay me?
- Yeah.

395
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:00,829
Cool.

396
00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:09,470
- You're a very graceful man.
- Someone's off the critical list.

397
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:12,579
Rapist for hire. You see me crying?

398
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:27,369
Wolfram & Hart,
How may I direct your call?

399
00:33:33,529 --> 00:33:37,880
- You were right, this is great.
- The vanilla makes it less latte-y.

400
00:33:38,329 --> 00:33:39,099
Yeah.

401
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:44,450
Where I'm from, they just have coffee.
Everything else is "L.A. stuff."

402
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,420
- Don't bone my boss.
- What?

403
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:50,390
Angel's strictly a no-bone.

404
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:54,549
I wasn't-- Cordelia, I don't
wanna sleep with Angel.

405
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:59,240
The thing about Angel,
he's old-fashioned. Old-fashioned.

406
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:03,829
Like, the age of chivalry.
He sees you as...

407
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,710
...the damsel in distress.

408
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:09,269
I think it's more
complicated than that.

409
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:12,760
- Why are you--?
- I think you're kind of dangerous.

410
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:19,389
I'm not being mean. I like you.
But you come on all helpless...

411
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:23,980
...and people who have thought
you were helpless have died.

412
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:28,320
Those men in the alley....
That was the only....

413
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:31,230
They were gonna hurt me.

414
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,590
You could have floated them away...

415
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:37,849
...or spun them until they puked.
You squashed them.

416
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,980
You don't know how scary it was.

417
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:49,010
Yes, I do.

418
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:53,099
I had a vision of you.
That's how Angel found you.

419
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:55,440
I felt everything.

420
00:34:56,329 --> 00:35:00,829
And those guys are better off
squashed, I truly think.

421
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,119
But in that moment,
a decision got made.

422
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,119
I don't want that
to happen to my friends.

423
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,750
Or, and I can't
stress this enough, me.

424
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:14,349
No matter what,
sex complicates the equation...

425
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,780
...even more than you think.

426
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,000
I get it.

427
00:35:20,929 --> 00:35:24,159
- You don't have to worry.
- Good.

428
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,550
- So are you and Angel--?
- Oh, no.

429
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,730
I like my men less broody
and more spendy.

430
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,900
He is kind of earnest.
He always seems--

431
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,269
What a jerk.

432
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,739
You're about to drop your--

433
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:44,000
Stop! Police!

434
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,849
Stay with me, stay with me.

435
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:54,480
Come on! No, Bethany, come on!

436
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:57,130
Come on! Come on, Bethany!

437
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:03,050
Bethany! You can squash those guys!

438
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,860
Cordelia!

439
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:08,280
Tan van! Fetch!

440
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,460
Take the wheel.

441
00:36:26,929 --> 00:36:28,159
Closer!

442
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,340
Shut up! Just shut up!

443
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,550
One more excuse,
and I'll bury you alive...

444
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:55,360
...next to my house,
so I can hear you screaming.

445
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:00,059
He took her to the hotel? Great.

446
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:04,679
He wants to play with
little Miss Time Bomb, let him.

447
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:06,980
Pull the trigger.

448
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,449
- Bethany.
- No, it's someone else!

449
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,269
I know Lilah.
She's not what you think.

450
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,090
- She's my friend!
- Angel.

451
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:19,710
It's not her! You're making it up!
You're playing with me!

452
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:22,539
- I don't want to play!
- Control yourself.

453
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:24,269
Don't touch me!

454
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,949
Maybe she just needs a time-out.

455
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,599
- Bethany, stop.
- I won't listen.

456
00:37:29,929 --> 00:37:31,369
- You can control this. Listen!
- No!

457
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:36,050
You have the power here.
You gonna kill us? You gonna die?

458
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,369
Then they win. Don't let them.

459
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,679
Don't let them touch you.

460
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:04,300
Hello, Rabbit.

461
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,579
- Daddy.
- God, Bethany, I've been so worried.

462
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:22,329
I couldn't have found you, except....

463
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:26,519
Your friend Lilah and I
only want to help you.

464
00:38:35,929 --> 00:38:37,820
I know what you can do, Bethany.

465
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:42,659
I know you don't mean to hurt anyone.

466
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,269
You're a good girl. I know that.

467
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,849
No more worries, all right?

468
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:52,110
You're coming with me.
We'll be a family again.

469
00:38:56,929 --> 00:38:58,960
Wouldn't you like to stop running?

470
00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:02,099
To come back where
people know you, love you?

471
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:07,820
It'll be just like it was before.

472
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:15,380
I've missed you so much.

473
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,880
Shh, Rabbit.

474
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,320
Bethany--

475
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,210
There you go.

476
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:36,019
Why don't we go downstairs,
just you and me?

477
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,039
What are you doing?

478
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:43,079
Stop it! Put me down!

479
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,550
I can't breathe.

480
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:52,539
Help me, please! Stop her!

481
00:39:53,329 --> 00:39:56,590
Bethany, you've got the power.

482
00:39:56,929 --> 00:39:58,369
Use it.

483
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:02,599
- Finish it.
- It hurts.

484
00:40:02,929 --> 00:40:04,719
Make it stop.

485
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,320
Goodbye.

486
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:43,880
You think that's it? Poof, you're
cured, the nightmares are gone?

487
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:48,989
- I'm not an idiot or a child.
- Yes, you are, and you need us.

488
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:53,800
Your powers will get out of control,
and you'll need a friend.

489
00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:57,650
Friends don't hire men
to rape and kidnap me.

490
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:00,190
At least not my close ones.

491
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:04,000
I was trying to make you stronger.

492
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:11,210
Good job.

493
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,710
Bethany. Bethany, wait.

494
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:18,150
- You could've been important.
- You gotta learn to lose.

495
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:20,309
You're not invited in.

496
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,269
Don't try to find me. I mean it.

497
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:27,260
But our firm doesn't want
to lose-- You're not....

498
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:31,710
He is a vampire, you know.

499
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,429
Weird.

500
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:41,760
You'll have to find
someone else's brain to play with.

501
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,269
Yeah, we have someone in mind.

502
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,320
Good night, Lilah.

503
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,000
Sweet dreams.

504
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:37,829
Thank you, thank you very much,
