1
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,660
"Shanshu."

2
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,900
"Shanshu."

3
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,170
Or maybe it's "shushan."

4
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:23,370
Why is it taking you so long
to figure out that word?

5
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,699
I don't know. The prophecies were
written over the last 4000 years...

6
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,509
...in a dozen languages,
some of which aren't human!.

7
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,380
Let's get a demon to suck my brain
out. That would speed things up.

8
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,670
He's testy while translating.

9
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:44,369
It's pivotal to what it prophesies
for the vampire with a soul.

10
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,820
Hurry and find out about Angel.
I want to know what it says about me.

11
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:53,159
If there is torrid romance
in my future, massive wealth.

12
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,530
I'll settle for enviable fame.

13
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:58,840
It's an ancient sacred text,
not a Magic 8-Ball.

14
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:04,379
- Nobody gets my humor.
- I thought it was funny.

15
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:05,700
Oh.

16
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,560
Hey, guys?

17
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:23,799
Remember the lawyer who wanted out
of Wolfram and Hart?

18
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,329
- Lindsey?
- They promoted him.

19
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:29,239
Junior partner.

20
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,379
After all you did, he sells
his soul for 30 pieces of silver.

21
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,230
Actually, he sold it for a six-figure
salary and a benefits package.

22
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,019
It's disappointing.
He had an opportunity to change.

23
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:46,069
He didn't take it.

24
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,810
What?

25
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:58,879
A little late for visitors.

26
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,000
- Mr. Nabbit?
- David?

27
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,800
Heart in my throat.

28
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:20,409
- I'm sorry.
- That was awesome.

29
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,340
Can we do it again?

30
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,490
Are you-- Do you need help?

31
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,819
Me? No, I just popped by to hang.

32
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,069
I blew off a meeting.
Tonight I'm dungeon master.

33
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,669
- What do you think of my cape?
- Shiny.

34
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:37,960
You guys want to hang?

35
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,150
Oh, wow, wow, wow.

36
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,030
This is where it all happens.

37
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,789
They're helpless, in agony.

38
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,259
They have no one to turn to
so they come here to you.

39
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,479
Drink that coffee, sit on this couch.

40
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:06,990
Unspeakable fiends of hell
hot on their heels.

41
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,280
What did I do today? Spun off my
digital-pager network, made a million.

42
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,509
All right, several. Big whoop.
What does that mean?

43
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:23,800
No more shopping in the PennySaver?

44
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,580
It's just, you guys...

45
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:31,139
...your lives are so
meaningful, so exciting.

46
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,430
You fight demons! One could
walk right through that door!

47
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,319
You seen any cool demons lately?

48
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,490
This hallowed ground is made
ready. His time is at hand.

49
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,099
For as it was written, he of pure
darkness shall come into light.

50
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,670
Welcome. I hope
you had a pleasant journey.

51
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,079
You, you guys are....

52
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,899
I never know
what's going to happen here.

53
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:48,750
- Good to see you.
- You too.

54
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:50,899
- Drop by again.
- We'll hang soon.

55
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:56,060
I know what it means.

56
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:58,910
A very wealthy man with
just no life at all?

57
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,250
No. The word in the scroll.

58
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:06,750
- That "shoe-shine" thing?
- Shanshu.

59
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,319
If it isn't Phygian but descends
from the ancient Magyars...

60
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:14,970
...then the root is Proto-Ugaric.

61
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,939
In which case it would mean....

62
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:21,470
We're waiting.

63
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:24,399
Death.

64
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,779
You said it was about
the vampire with the soul.

65
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,350
Angel's going to die?

66
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,319
Oh. Anything else?

67
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,670
He took that well. Is this
a good time to talk about my raise?

68
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,939
It's probably years off,
after the coming battles.

69
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,040
My raise?

70
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,199
Apocalyptic prophecies
aren't a science.

71
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:58,480
And I could be way off the mark
so no reason to be concerned.

72
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,709
So it's good you're not concerned.

73
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:07,310
Not even remotely concerned.

74
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:19,949
- Pain...killer.
- Painful, killer demon.

75
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,350
Painkiller!

76
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:28,519
A woman. Judging by the bag
on her head, I'm guessing homeless.

77
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,740
- Versus a slime demon.
- Where?

78
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:35,509
I smelled something awful,
that would be the slime demon...

79
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:41,300
...who lives behind a waste
treatment plant in El Segundo.

80
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,829
- Do you need--
- Stay here and take care of her.

81
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,899
- Enough with the smelly visions!
- Here we are.

82
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:56,329
Thanks. If I ever meet The Powers
That Be, I'll punch them in the nose!

83
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,209
You think they have a nose?

84
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:05,850
You lost the scroll of Aberjian?

85
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:10,259
- It was stolen from our vault.
- We need it for the raising.

86
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:14,250
- We understand.
- It was my mistake. I'll fix it.

87
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,009
You will do nothing. I will retrieve
the scroll myself. Who stole it?

88
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,300
- Angel.
- Angel.

89
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,470
I am summoned for the raising...

90
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:30,839
...the thing that was
to bring him to us...

91
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:34,360
...tear him from The Powers
That Be, and he has the scroll?

92
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,480
We're aware of the irony.

93
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:41,139
He possesses the prophecies.
His connection is complete.

94
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,549
- He hasn't had time to study the text.
- No, and he won't.

95
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:50,210
Access to The Powers shall be cut off
from him and the scroll returned.

96
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,220
- What can we do to help?
- Leave it to me.

97
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,789
Well, end of discussion.

98
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:10,649
Told you. She listens
to the nut calls on her scanner.

99
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,649
Sure she doesn't use her brain chip?

100
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:20,669
Detective, there was a lot of
"otherworldly howling and wailing."

101
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,360
Something about something slimy
dragging a woman.

102
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,320
I heard the call. Stay here.

103
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,600
- You want backup, detective?
- Or a Ouija board?

104
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,580
You turn your back
and they come for you.

105
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:58,470
- You're safe now.
- You sliced him up real good.

106
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,460
He saved me from one of their spies.

107
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,940
I don't appreciate the dental
association watching me like that.

108
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:11,500
- Hi.
- What was it?

109
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,779
- It won't hurt anyone else.
- What was it?

110
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:18,309
Slime demon.

111
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:23,000
This town has everything.
Demons, fiends, vampires....

112
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,830
I know this isn't easy for you.
Most people can't deal with it.

113
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:30,279
You should think about--

114
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,149
Someone who's not even a person
lecturing me on most people.

115
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:36,070
It's kind of funny.

116
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:39,419
I can handle it fine.

117
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:43,049
I don't care about most
people or what they think.

118
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,279
I do care about ridding
this city of your kind.

119
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,639
- My kind?
- Your kind.

120
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,899
The kind that killed my father.

121
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,259
You think I would forget about it?

122
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,320
I don't forget anything.

123
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,840
Death.

124
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:34,669
Every source says it's death.

125
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:39,820
It's just a prophecy.
It didn't come from on high.

126
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:43,070
That's what a prophecy is.

127
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:48,070
All right. Angel faces
death all the time...

128
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,919
...just like a normal guy faces
waffles and French fries.

129
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:56,049
It's something he faces
every day, like lunch.

130
00:11:57,129 --> 00:11:58,950
Are you hungry?

131
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,559
The fact his death is prophesied...

132
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:08,830
...doesn't concern me as
much as the way he reacted.

133
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:12,750
What? He didn't scream as some of us
would have. Angel's cool.

134
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:15,370
Angel's cut off.

135
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,059
Death doesn't bother him because
there's nothing in life he wants.

136
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:23,129
It's our desires that make us human.

137
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:27,570
Angel's kind of human.
He's got a soul.

138
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,809
He's got a soul, but he's
not a part of the world.

139
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:34,179
He can't be part of the world.

140
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:37,600
Because he doesn't want stuff?
That's ridiculous.

141
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:41,159
- I want that!
- What connects us to life?

142
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:42,970
I'm going with doughnuts.

143
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,440
What connects us to life is the simple
truth that we are part of it.

144
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:50,519
We live, we grow, we change.

145
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:56,509
- But Angel....
- Can't do those things.

146
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,840
Well, what are you saying?

147
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,330
That Angel has nothing
to look forward to?

148
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:11,299
- He'll always be here but cut off?
- Yes.

149
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,429
That sucks!
We've gotta do something.

150
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,860
- We have to help him.
- I'm not sure we can.

151
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:23,259
What is your deal? You bore everyone
with your musty scrolls...

152
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:25,950
...then you say we can't help?

153
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:29,340
- He is what he is.
- He's Angel. He's good.

154
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:32,899
And he helps the helpless,
and now he's one of them.

155
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:37,000
He's gonna have to
want things from life...

156
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:39,509
...whether he wants to or not!

157
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,149
- Morning.
- Morning. Want some coffee?

158
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,059
No, thanks.

159
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,919
- How about a doughnut? Chocolate.
- No.

160
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:56,409
- Creamy fillings?
- I don't want anything.

161
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:01,879
Should I know what this is about?

162
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,309
We were just discussing
how you don't...

163
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,529
...want many things.

164
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:14,269
You're cut off from life,
and we want to help.

165
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:17,690
- Good.
- We'll start small. Keep it simple.

166
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,590
How would you like a puppy?

167
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,240
Right. A ficus?
They're low-maintenance.

168
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:27,720
Ant farm?

169
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,080
- I have to go.
- Where are you going?

170
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,279
Rare book shops. I need references
to translate the prophecy.

171
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:37,950
Not smart to take the scroll with me.

172
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:40,700
I'll lock it up
in the weapons cabinet.

173
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:43,879
Angel, I hope I'm
wrong about this, but...

174
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:46,279
...you should see the Oracles.

175
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,259
I don't need the Oracles.

176
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,840
Well, think about it.

177
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,769
Oracles.

178
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,409
Get out of the house.

179
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:04,570
Could be fun.

180
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:17,059
- How dare you enter this sacred space?
- Who are you?

181
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:19,779
We don't like being
called by a lower being.

182
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:22,350
Never come here on a whim.

183
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,889
- I'm not here on a whim.
- We do not counsel your kind.

184
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:32,549
Darkness is not allowed past this
threshold. How did you get in?

185
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:36,149
The old order passes away
and the new order is come.

186
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,769
He that was first will be last,
and he that was dead shall arise.

187
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:44,549
Yes, and he that is trespassing
shall now depart.

188
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,840
We shall speak no more.

189
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:53,340
Yes, I know.

190
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,539
Do you paint?

191
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:37,500
I was looking for
something for a friend.

192
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,970
I thought maybe if he had a hobby....

193
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:42,690
He's a little detached.

194
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,669
They say art is the best therapy.

195
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,539
- Really?
- Sure.

196
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:51,149
It's used in mental institutions.
Creating helps them get in touch.

197
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,000
He's not crazy or anything.
He's just different.

198
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:57,450
Depressed.

199
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,019
Well, he wears a lot of black.

200
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,740
- How much are these pastels?
- You get the entire set...

201
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:07,849
...some drawing paper
and little pop-up easel....

202
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:25,529
You have everything he'll need,
and then some. Thanks.

203
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:28,539
- You're welcome.
- He must be a good friend.

204
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,009
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Take care.

205
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,390
Bye.

206
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,380
Someone get some help! Call 911!

207
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,279
Hello?

208
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:54,609
Yeah, what happened to her?
I'm her employer.

209
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:58,029
She doesn't have any family in town.
What happened?

210
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:01,109
I'm on my way.

211
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,210
I'm looking for Cordelia Chase.

212
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,910
The doctor is with her.
If you'll just have a seat.

213
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,269
You have to let the doctor work!

214
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,200
Try another five mils of Ativan.

215
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:54,049
- Leave.
- What happened?

216
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,319
- Are you family?
- Yes.

217
00:20:55,609 --> 00:20:57,359
I'm not sure what happened.

218
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,750
- Is she mentally ill?
- No.

219
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,220
She's having a psychotic episode.

220
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:07,589
There's no organic damage,
but we can't seem to sedate her.

221
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:13,700
Cordelia, can you hear me? Cordelia!

222
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:17,910
Cordelia!

223
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,740
- We tried drug therapy. Allergies?
- Drugs won't help.

224
00:21:22,609 --> 00:21:26,049
I need to inform you, if we don't
find a way to stop it....

225
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,210
Wesley! Wesley!

226
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,289
Wesley!

227
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:46,970
Wes!

228
00:22:53,329 --> 00:22:54,450
Wes, Wesley!

229
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:23,069
Never a dull moment.

230
00:23:23,329 --> 00:23:27,049
- I have to go.
- You're a witness. You can't go.

231
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:31,109
- Want to try to stop me?
- I'm glad we're not friends.

232
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,779
I'm tired of you.
There is a thing called the law!

233
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:39,470
This is about life. I'm sorry about
your father, but I didn't kill him.

234
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:43,710
I'm tired of being blamed
for what you can't handle!

235
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:46,500
You want to be enemies? Try me.

236
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:55,650
Clear! Okay, I got him back.

237
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:57,730
Cordelia.

238
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,319
I'm gonna fix this.

239
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:06,660
I promise.

240
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,680
I'm gonna get you back.

241
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,410
I need you back.

242
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:38,109
I come before the Oracles
for guidance and direction.

243
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,549
I ask access to the knowing ones.

244
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,789
It's unfortunate.

245
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,109
Things are unraveling. The dark ones
broach our temples now.

246
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:20,039
- Can you help me?
- I can't stay long.

247
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,920
I've been dead a while.
So far I don't like it.

248
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:26,819
- My friend--
- Is in trouble. It's his mark.

249
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:31,509
- Who did it?
- Vocah, warrior of the underworld.

250
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:36,660
He wants you weak, so he opened her
mind to all those in pain and need.

251
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,940
- She doesn't have long.
- How can I stop it?

252
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,519
Vocah has the scroll of Aberjian.
The scroll is what you need.

253
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,309
- Wait.
- Find the scroll.

254
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,299
The words of Anatole
can save your friend.

255
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:55,619
- Where is he?
- He is here for the raising.

256
00:26:56,089 --> 00:26:59,569
- The raising?
- Like many, he hides behind man's law.

257
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,890
Stop him.

258
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,880
I will.

259
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:11,849
Hungry people will appreciate this.

260
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:16,609
This is God's work. If God was
a busboy he'd look like you, Jesus.

261
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,160
Toss it up, brother. All right!

262
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:21,170
Heads up!

263
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,309
Put them down. I know him.

264
00:27:28,769 --> 00:27:31,579
- What you got under the hood?
- I need your help.

265
00:27:32,369 --> 00:27:34,509
I know you didn't come
to see how I am.

266
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:38,529
I'm fine. You getting enough iron?
You look a little pale.

267
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:43,680
It's traditional to humor people
that do favors for you.

268
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:45,420
I need another.

269
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:47,710
If it's killing
a vampire, I'm in.

270
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:49,759
That's my idea of a good time.

271
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:51,519
My people are in the hospital.

272
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,339
One's in ICU, one's in the psych unit.

273
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,750
They need protection.

274
00:27:57,569 --> 00:27:59,009
Who's coming for them?

275
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:02,390
However he comes, he will fail.
These people mean a lot to me.

276
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:04,940
I'm getting that.

277
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,589
We have prepared a holy place
and anointed it with oil.

278
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,750
We took the blood of the living
and gathered the living dead.

279
00:28:30,569 --> 00:28:32,890
As it was written,
they shall prepare the way...

280
00:28:33,569 --> 00:28:36,130
...and the very gates
of hell shall open.

281
00:28:36,569 --> 00:28:39,099
That which is above shall tremble...

282
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:42,200
...for that which
is below shall arise.

283
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,920
And the world shall know the beast...

284
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,730
...and the beast shall know the world.

285
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:01,619
Are we late?

286
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:03,730
Never be on time for a ritual.

287
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:06,339
The chanting and blood rites
go on forever.

288
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:12,559
You guys follow us.

289
00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:16,619
- I know you covered all the bases.
- Yes.

290
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:18,769
Senior partners are watching this.

291
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:21,839
- We can't let them down.
- We won't.

292
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:28,720
Robert Price let them down
and they made him eat his liver.

293
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:32,500
I don't know why I thought of that.

294
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,569
- Five are without breath.
- Yet they live.

295
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:13,819
- Five are without time.
- Yet they live.

296
00:30:22,769 --> 00:30:25,160
- Five are without soul.
- Yet they live.

297
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:28,759
They haven't even gotten
to the Latin yet.

298
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:33,759
- Five are without sun.
- Yet they live.

299
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:51,660
- What is it?
- I don't know.

300
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,890
Lindsey.

301
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:21,980
Five are dead.

302
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:26,180
- Say it!
- Yet they live.

303
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,539
- Get the movers.
- Yes, sir.

304
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,119
Get it out of here.

305
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:07,529
Nice.

306
00:33:21,089 --> 00:33:23,789
Lindsey, give me the scroll.

307
00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:27,180
No. It belongs to us.

308
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:30,990
"Us." You put your
faith in Wolfram and Hart.

309
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:34,559
- You said I had to make a choice.
- And you did.

310
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:36,690
Yeah.

311
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:40,130
I had a crisis. I want to thank you
for your help with that.

312
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:44,329
- I see things more clearly now.
- You don't see at all.

313
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,660
I see that this was foretold
and that doesn't bode well for you.

314
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:55,170
I see that you're either the one
with the power or powerless.

315
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:58,519
Do you see what I'll do
if I don't get the scroll?

316
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:03,210
You need this to cure your friend.
She is your link to The Powers.

317
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:08,469
And since it's foretold that we sever
all your connections, well....

318
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:23,050
Don't believe
everything you're foretold.

319
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:33,969
"And if the beast shalt
find thee, and touch thee...

320
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,289
...thou shalt be wounded
in thy soul...

321
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,030
...and thou shalt know madness.

322
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:45,340
The beast shalt attack
and cripple thee...

323
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:49,320
...and thou shalt know
neither friend nor family.

324
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:54,409
But thou shalt undo the beast.

325
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:58,219
Thou shalt find
the sacred words of Anatole...

326
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:02,349
...and thou shalt be restored.

327
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:08,280
Three times shalt thou say
these words:

328
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:13,110
Unbind, unbind, unbind."

329
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,380
- Hey.
- Angel.

330
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,800
Welcome back.

331
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,360
I'll get Dr. Evans.

332
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:52,000
I saw them all.
There is so much pain.

333
00:35:57,809 --> 00:35:59,769
We have to help them.

334
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,369
We will.

335
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:04,889
We will.

336
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:26,530
- Here is something.
- What?

337
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:31,389
The beast of Amalfi, a razor-toothed,
six-eyed harbinger of death.

338
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:36,650
No, wait, that's due
to arise in 2003 in Reseda.

339
00:36:37,409 --> 00:36:39,510
I would've guessed Tarzana.

340
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,639
Better cross-reference that.

341
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:47,309
I don't know what they
raised in that box.

342
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:50,389
I'll keep looking.

343
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:54,400
You've been looking for two days.
You need to relax and recharge.

344
00:36:54,809 --> 00:36:56,250
Here. Eat.

345
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,380
You too.

346
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,860
Don't be embarrassed. We're family.

347
00:37:10,409 --> 00:37:11,739
What?

348
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:15,199
It's just I'm not used to....

349
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:17,179
He's not used to the new you.

350
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,360
I know what's out there now.

351
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:26,269
We have a lot of evil to fight,
a lot of people to help.

352
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,880
I hope you can figure
out what the lawyers raised...

353
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:33,409
...sometime before the prophecy
kicks in, and you croak.

354
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,019
- That was the old me, wasn't it?
- I like them both.

355
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,309
Oops.

356
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,840
I may have made a mistake.

357
00:37:52,409 --> 00:37:55,219
The word that I said meant
you were going to die...

358
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,940
...means that you are going to live.

359
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,380
Okay, as tiny mistakes go,
that's not one.

360
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:07,349
Shanshu has roots in many languages.
The most ancient is the Proto-Bantu.

361
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:10,469
They consider life and death
the same thing.

362
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,619
It's part of a cycle.

363
00:38:13,409 --> 00:38:15,869
Only a thing that's not alive
never dies.

364
00:38:16,409 --> 00:38:18,969
It's saying you get to live
until you die.

365
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:24,289
It's saying....
It's saying you become human.

366
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:29,460
That's the prophecy?

367
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,099
"The vampire with a soul,
once he fulfills his destiny...

368
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,679
...will shanshu." Become human.

369
00:38:39,809 --> 00:38:41,139
It's his reward.

370
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,380
Wow. Angel, human.

371
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,340
That'd be nice.

372
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:52,809
Wait. What's that thing about him
having to fulfill his destiny first?

373
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:56,769
It's saying it won't happen
tomorrow or the next day.

374
00:38:57,809 --> 00:39:01,599
He has to survive coming darkness,
apocalyptic battles, plagues...

375
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,590
...and some...

376
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,219
...several, not that many...

377
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,849
...fiends that will be
unleashed upon the world.

378
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,570
So don't break out
the champagne just yet.

379
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:17,449
Yeah, break out the champagne,
Pinocchio. This is a big deal.

380
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,119
I guess it is.

381
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,239
Typical.

382
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:31,639
I hook up with the only person
who came to L.A. to get older.

383
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:56,099
The senior partners were
impressed with your sacrifice.

384
00:39:57,809 --> 00:40:00,579
Trust me.
We'll even the score with him.

385
00:40:01,409 --> 00:40:02,570
Yes, we will.

386
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:07,079
Beginning with what's in that box.

387
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:12,300
We are all very pleased you're here.

388
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:16,010
I know it's a bit confusing...

389
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,039
...but it's gonna be better soon.

390
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:21,019
A lot better...

391
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:24,869
...Darla.
