1
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:05,379
You try our patience.

2
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:07,780
- What is done--
- Cannot be undone.

3
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:09,539
I know. You keep saying that.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,400
But I need Doyle.
You can fold time. Bring him back.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,650
To what end?
To nullify his noble death?

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,699
- To leave his atonement unfulfilled?
- If it means he lives.

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,789
- He doesn't so that you may.
- You do so that others will.

8
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:27,260
He's my friend.

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,260
If that is so, then so
shall it ever be.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,060
- But it is of no consequence.
- The war rages on.

11
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:37,670
Do not come to us again
on so self-serving a matter.

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,750
There's one consequence,
even by your generous standards.

13
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:45,609
He was my sole contact
to The Powers That Be.

14
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:48,719
Without his visions,
I'm fighting blind.

15
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:51,329
All will soon be made clear.

16
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:54,469
For every door that closes,
another opens.

17
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:56,909
And for every one that opens....

18
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,150
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing.

19
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:29,949
Doyle's special coffee mug.

20
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:32,360
Doyle didn't have one.

21
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:36,800
Don't you think he should've?

22
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:48,409
I guess I thought
it would make me feel better...

23
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,810
...if I could hold something
that he left behind.

24
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,509
Some evidence he was here.
But there's nothing.

25
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,270
Almost like...

26
00:02:58,129 --> 00:02:59,360
- ...like he never--
- Cordelia.

27
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:02,780
Get out.

28
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,860
- What?
- I mean, of the office.

29
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,560
Take the day off. Go live a bit.
I can manage here.

30
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,180
I know what you're doing, Angel.

31
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,110
- What?
- You're pushing me away.

32
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,580
- Close yourself off.
- That's not--

33
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,259
I've got news for you.
We're all we've got now.

34
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:23,699
You don't like sharing grief, but it's
the normal way of dealing with loss.

35
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,780
I'm not going anywhere, so get used
to it. I'm staying right here.

36
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:32,460
I gotta go.

37
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,199
Audition. If it wasn't a national,
I'd blow it off.

38
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:41,629
- Don't go if you don't feel up to it.
- Reverse psychology. Very cute.

39
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,469
- I'm going.
- I'm not--

40
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:46,750
- Don't get any ideas. I'll be back.
- Right.

41
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,620
- You scared the heck out of me.
- You?

42
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:54,090
I scared you?
Look in the mirror lately?

43
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:56,639
Every chance I get.

44
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,000
You're him, right?

45
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,469
You're the guy.
The vampire with the soul?

46
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:03,240
- I'm Angel.
- You gotta help me.

47
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:07,639
Please. I mean that's what you do,
right? You help the helpless.

48
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,069
You protect the, what do
you call them? The helpless.

49
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,610
- Something like that.
- Should I stay?

50
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:15,099
- That's okay.
- Break a leg.

51
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:18,620
- Excuse me?
- I sense a little performance anxiety.

52
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:22,319
- Little trick, picture everybody--
- In their underwear.

53
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:27,120
I was gonna say dead. But, hey,
if that underwear thing works....

54
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:28,649
So...

55
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:33,129
- ...what's the problem?
- Call me Barney.

56
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:37,850
First off, you should know,
before there's any misunderstanding...

57
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,800
...I'm a demon.

58
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:44,949
- I appreciate your candor.
- Secondly, it's 3:45 in the afternoon.

59
00:04:45,529 --> 00:04:48,019
Middle of the day.
Why aren't you in your coffin?

60
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,399
Coffin. I hate that stereotype.

61
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,879
- Do you know anything about vampires?
- What I learned from TV.

62
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:00,019
Vampires don't use coffins.
It's a misconception...

63
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:02,110
...made by writers and the media.

64
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:05,589
We can move around as long as
we avoid direct sunlight. Got it?

65
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:09,129
Sorry. Didn't want to push
any sore spots.

66
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:14,959
Okay, let's try this
whenever you're ready.

67
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:17,709
Action.

68
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,990
Look at this wine stain.
I can't meet your folks like this.

69
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:25,220
Don't worry, honey. It's no problem
with extra-strength StainBeGone.

70
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:28,050
- Extra-strength StainBeGone?
- Yep.

71
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:34,709
Now StainBeGone is more
effective at melting away...

72
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,850
...stubborn blood, wine...

73
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,199
...even grass stains.

74
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,290
See?

75
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,139
Just spray it on...

76
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,779
...and rub it in...

77
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,949
...and in minutes...

78
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,160
...the stain is gone.

79
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:01,050
It's completely gone.

80
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,180
- Okay, that was....
- Good. That was good.

81
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,420
- Very nice.
- Good, good.

82
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,800
But I think what we're
going for is more of a--

83
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,290
- Happy.
- Happy, yeah.

84
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,850
- An "up" feeling about cleaning.
- Because stains are--

85
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:22,730
- Not good.
- Exactly.

86
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:24,139
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:27,620
It's an interesting choice.
Let's try again. We'll go from:

88
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,490
- "StainBeGone is more effective."
- Yeah.

89
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,120
Now, StainBeGone...

90
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:41,430
...is more...

91
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:42,980
...effective!

92
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,740
Grass stains!

93
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,910
- Okay, nice adjustment.
- Thanks.

94
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,399
We'll let you know.

95
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,079
- What's hunting you?
- I don't know. But whoever it is...

96
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:09,769
...he's unstoppable, like a machine.

97
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,009
Been on my tail through a few states.
Ever since Phoenix.

98
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:16,750
Pulled out all the stops to shake him,
but he keeps on coming.

99
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,949
You think he means you harm?

100
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,500
He's not tracking me to tell me
I won the Publishers Clearinghouse.

101
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,230
He's an assassin,

102
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:29,250
- Is he a demon?
- He could be,

103
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,430
He knows all the hangouts.
Wherever I go...

104
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:36,480
...he's just a step behind. It's a
miracle I've eluded him this long.

105
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:47,850
Why you?

106
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,529
- What do you mean?
- Who are you?

107
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,740
That's what I'm saying.
I'm nothing. I'm a nobody.

108
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:58,329
I'm just a guy trying to get by.
No different from everybody else.

109
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,420
Been my experience that when one
is being pursued tenaciously...

110
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,300
...it's because the pursuer
has a strong grievance.

111
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,730
Hey, I never said I was a boy scout.

112
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:13,750
I'm an Empath demon.
I can read emotions.

113
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:18,939
Gives me a slight advantage at cards.
Blackjack, poker, and for the fights.

114
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,350
So you're a cheat.

115
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:23,990
I think of it as going
with my strengths.

116
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:27,519
Look, whatever. I'm a demon.
Sure, I'm evil.

117
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,009
But, hey, I'm not, you know, "evil."

118
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,830
You don't have beef with anyone?

119
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,200
No one. But like my old man always
said, "Can't please everybody."

120
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:50,850
So you gonna help me?

121
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:56,370
Hi.

122
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:02,860
Everything okay?

123
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:11,830
Okay.

124
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:18,100
Cordelia, that was--
I think you're acting out of grief.

125
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:21,389
- You're confusing our--
- I didn't feel anything.

126
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:25,230
- Did you feel anything?
- No, that's what I'm trying--

127
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:29,149
That means that I still have it.
I can't believe he did this to me.

128
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,529
- Who did what?
- Doyle.

129
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,649
I thought our kiss meant something.
Instead, he used the moment...

130
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,240
...to pass it on to me. Why couldn't
it have been mono or herpes?

131
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:43,549
I didn't ask for this responsibility,
unlike some who shall remain lifeless.

132
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:45,570
I have nothing to atone.

133
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:49,370
If they know what's good for them,
The PTB better stay out of my head.

134
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:51,250
Powers That Be.

135
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,379
- You had a vision.
- Boy, howdy!

136
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,860
You know how they look painful?
They feel a whole lot worse.

137
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,980
Another door opens.

138
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:07,090
- You're my link to The Powers now.
- I'm nobody's link.

139
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:11,779
I lost control of my entire central
nervous system with that vision.

140
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:16,440
And I'm not certain, but I think
I may have drooled a little.

141
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:19,759
- It's my first audition in weeks.
- What was it?

142
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:23,220
StainBeGone. A national, no less.
Probably never call me again.

143
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,570
- What was the vision?
- Who knows? It was a thing.

144
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,419
- A thing?
- An ugly, gray, blobby thing.

145
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:35,179
- What difference does it make?
- This could be a dangerous thing.

146
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,639
I want it out. If kissing's
the only way to get rid of it...

147
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,379
...I will smooch every damn frog
in this kingdom.

148
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:45,710
Oh, thought I heard voices.

149
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:50,360
Barney, you remember
my associate, Cor--

150
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:53,299
--delia?

151
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,490
Maybe not every frog.

152
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:59,710
Boy, I gotta say, I like the way
you people treat your clients.

153
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:01,909
Excuse me.

154
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:09,700
- He's a client?
- Something's after him.

155
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:13,409
- The ugly, gray, blobby thing?
- You tell me.

156
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,309
Try sketching it. In the meantime,
Barney would feel safer downstairs.

157
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:19,629
Babysit him.

158
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:21,740
- Where are you going?
- His apartment.

159
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:24,700
He thinks it knows where he lives.

160
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:31,480
Behave yourself. I don't want to
find you two necking on the couch.

161
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:06,809
Hello, Angel.

162
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:10,159
Wesley.

163
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,049
- Never thought you'd see me again?
- I didn't think about it. What are--?

164
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:16,440
Hup, hup, hup.

165
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,950
I'm the one asking questions here.
And I think it only fair to warn you:

166
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:24,019
Any sudden movement
and I'll be forced to--

167
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:25,610
Right.

168
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:28,470
You had a question?

169
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:36,830
Interesting look for you.
Motorcycle.

170
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,009
The Watchers' Council
trying out a new image?

171
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:44,840
In point of fact,
I no longer work for the Council.

172
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:51,049
I believe I am of greater value
to the cause, working autonomously.

173
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,899
- They fired you.
- Hardly.

174
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:57,200
With Buffy unwilling
to follow orders...

175
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,110
...there was no opportunity
to function as Watcher.

176
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,889
And that's why I became
a rogue demon hunter.

177
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,740
- You're a demon hunter?
- Rogue demon hunter, yes.

178
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:11,919
I'm on the trail of
a nasty bugger right now.

179
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:14,419
- I suggest you stay out of my way.
- Easy, tiger.

180
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:19,500
I think you're making a mistake.
This demon seems harmless to me.

181
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,139
He's left a trail
of mutilated corpses.

182
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,419
- Mutilated?
- Each victim possessed a unique power.

183
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:30,440
Telepathy, poisoned tongues,
healing hands.

184
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:35,129
The physical source of their power was
ripped and torn from their corpses.

185
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,840
- He's collecting powers.
- To what purpose, I can only guess.

186
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,110
The fiend's cut a swath
across half the continent.

187
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,500
Almost caught it in Phoenix.
Got a fair look too.

188
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,940
- Kind of short? Ruddy complexion?
- Short? No, on the contrary.

189
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:55,179
Quite enormous and powerful.
More of a yellow-green.

190
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,539
It seems to be secreting
some sort of viscous fluid.

191
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:01,370
Like that?

192
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,399
I hear drawing can be very therapeutic
during a grieving period.

193
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:53,399
- What?
- I'm sorry.

194
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:56,370
Couldn't help sensing your pain.

195
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:00,250
You just lost someone
close to you, didn't you?

196
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,090
- Angel told you?
- No, I'm empathic.

197
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,340
I feel your feelings
when you feel them.

198
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,059
- It's a gift my kind is blessed with.
- Really? My kind believes in privacy.

199
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,149
You shouldn't nose around other
people's feelings without asking.

200
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:22,970
You're right. I'm sorry.
Just trying to make conversation.

201
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,169
Wait.

202
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,429
Barney, I'm sorry.

203
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,409
I'm just going through a difficult
time right now. I'm just--

204
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,080
Missing your friend.

205
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:38,220
- Why don't you tell me about him?
- Doyle?

206
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,620
He drank too much and his taste
in clothing was like a Greek tragedy.

207
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,919
And he could be really
sweet sometimes.

208
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,129
You'll like this. He was half demon,
a secret he kept from me forever.

209
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:56,970
I guess that's why he
sometimes smelled weird.

210
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,309
You remind me a little of him.

211
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,410
I'll take that as a compliment.

212
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,410
That's him.

213
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:10,700
- Barney.
- He's after me!

214
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,529
Barney, it's okay.

215
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,650
The books are over there.

216
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:20,369
Good lord. Cordelia?

217
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:24,769
Angel never mentioned.
Well, what a nice...

218
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,730
...surprise.

219
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,880
- Didn't work!
- No?

220
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:46,910
I think it went
better than last time.

221
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,470
No. It was just a kind of experiment.
I was trying....

222
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,450
Wesley?

223
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:55,309
What are you doing here?
Are you working with Angel?

224
00:17:55,849 --> 00:18:00,420
A lone wolf never works with anyone.
I'm only allowing Angel to assist me.

225
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:04,730
- Wow.
- I'm a rogue demon hunter now.

226
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,980
Wow.

227
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:10,130
What's a rogue demon?

228
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:14,400
So you're saying, all this time
your friend wasn't hunting me...

229
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:18,140
- ...but what was hunting me?
- That's about the size of it.

230
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,630
- Why is the other thing after me?
- It wants your empathic ability.

231
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,319
The feeling feelings thing?

232
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,599
- What kind of demon would do this?
- A Kungai.

233
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:31,170
- Kungai?
- The description matches.

234
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,039
It's of Asian origin, very deadly.

235
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,269
"A powerful race of demons,
the Kungai possess a Tak horn...

236
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:40,730
...capable of consuming
its opponent's life force."

237
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:46,160
- We're lucky to have escaped alive.
- Hey, I know these Kungais.

238
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:48,150
They're relentless killers.

239
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,680
- You gotta take it out.
- I'm on it.

240
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:52,799
I have to find it first.

241
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:58,559
Hang on. It's of Asian origin.

242
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:01,690
I tracked it through
an Asian district just north of here.

243
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,869
- Koreatown.
- It's very likely it's hiding there.

244
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:08,259
- That's where I'll start looking.
- Don't you mean "we"?

245
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,000
- I work alone, Wesley.
- The hell, you say.

246
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,230
This demon is mine. Angel!

247
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,839
I know how to track him.
You're not catching him without me.

248
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:21,390
I had somebody at my side.

249
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:23,829
He's dead now.

250
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:28,130
I won't let that happen again.
I work alone.

251
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,150
- You don't even know where to start.
- I have an idea.

252
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,380
Yes.

253
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,809
Well.

254
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:46,900
- Are you all right, Wesley?
- No. These pants chafe one's...

255
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,480
...legs.

256
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:54,720
Hey, do you know where they
do the shiatsu massages?

257
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,220
That's kind of nice.

258
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:07,009
- What is it?
- I don't know.

259
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:10,180
I don't know! I don't know.

260
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:12,900
You're frustrated.

261
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:16,750
That's one spooky talent.
You can just look at me...

262
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:21,359
...grinding my teeth, grunting,
and sense that I'm frustrated?

263
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:25,069
- Amazing.
- It's good at sensing sarcasm too.

264
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,990
- Can I help?
- Only if you can explain...

265
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,079
...why I have to suffer
splitting migraines...

266
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,569
...getting visions so vague
they require closed captioning.

267
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:37,009
What do you mean, visions?

268
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,890
My friend Doyle used to get
brain flashes, messages from The PTB.

269
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,569
The Powers That Be.

270
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,289
Visions of all sorts of stuff.
People in trouble...

271
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,150
...things causing trouble,
places trouble's happening.

272
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,759
- And he left you that inheritance?
- I'm never gonna forgive him.

273
00:21:58,089 --> 00:22:00,509
What? Choosing you?

274
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,740
Trusting you with an enormous
responsibility?

275
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:07,779
Believing that you were
the only one worthy...

276
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:10,569
...of such a rare and important gift?

277
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,250
Did I mention the drooling?

278
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,549
I get the impression Doyle didn't
have much by way of possessions?

279
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,859
No. No, he didn't.

280
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:26,480
Seems like he gave you
the most valuable thing he had.

281
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,049
I hope you like your coffee black,
because the boss's lightener...

282
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:51,299
- ...is O-positive.
- Black is great.

283
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,750
Hank, it's me.

284
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:05,269
Of course I got the Kungai horn.
In a safe place.

285
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,900
But listen...

286
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,240
...I think I just found something
even better.

287
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,039
It's strong and a little clumpy.
I can't brew the old-fashioned way.

288
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:34,349
I'm more the "auto-drip." Sorry.

289
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,910
Yes, you are.

290
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,319
- What?
- Sorry. Pathetic, really.

291
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,269
Thanks for that insight,
Mr. Emotional Radar.

292
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:46,670
- How old are you?
- That's none--

293
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,710
Twenty-something?
With your head in the clouds...

294
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,920
...and your feet in shoes
you can't afford...

295
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,380
...all self-absorbed,
full of regret.

296
00:23:56,849 --> 00:24:01,420
Poor little Cordelia with her
delusions of an acting career.

297
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:06,640
- Delusions?
- You don't think you'll succeed?

298
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,210
- You're a terrible actress.
- You've never seen me.

299
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:15,039
- How could you possibly know?
- Because you know. You feel it.

300
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:21,319
Your entire being is whispering it
to me right now.

301
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,509
Me, on the other hand?
You must admit I'm a fine actor.

302
00:24:26,849 --> 00:24:27,829
Fooled you.

303
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:34,670
You dislike the truth. No wonder
Doyle never showed his demon half.

304
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,940
You don't know anything
about me or Doyle.

305
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,029
I know you let him die.

306
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:46,809
- That is not true.
- No, but it feels true, doesn't it?

307
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:51,990
Mixed in with all the pain and grief,
a healthy dollop of guilt.

308
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,480
A nagging thought that, somehow,
you could've saved him.

309
00:24:56,849 --> 00:25:00,150
If you'd been nicer to him.
If you'd let your walls down.

310
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:03,859
If only for one freaking second...

311
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:08,269
...you gave a damn about anyone
besides yourself, huh?

312
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:10,150
- Let me--
- Shut up!

313
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,460
So you hate your gift, the visions?

314
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:18,220
You'd love to rip those pretty eyes
out of your head. I know I would.

315
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:41,519
- I don't know your language.
- I do.

316
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,240
I think I recognize the dialect.

317
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,920
Then it's good you came by.

318
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:53,970
- The wound wasn't fatal.
- It wasn't. Look at his head.

319
00:25:55,049 --> 00:25:56,769
His Tak horn's broken.

320
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,230
Not...stick...not...not dying...

321
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,500
...horn. I think he's trying
to say his horn was taken.

322
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:08,769
Yes, but by whom?

323
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:13,559
Good. Terror. I feel it.
You have no idea what a rush it is.

324
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,410
Keep it coming.

325
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:17,210
The horn was taken.

326
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:26,119
His horn was taken for something.
The "Klu-Ka." I don't know that word.

327
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:31,000
Yes. Fish...fish will die...

328
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:34,670
...not fish.... More...die more?
Oh. He says more will die.

329
00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:38,339
- Okay, how? Who?
- No good losing patience.

330
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:40,599
He's dying and I'm not fluent.

331
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,160
A vision. I'm having a vision.

332
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:52,519
A demon! A creepy, little--
You! It's definitely you!

333
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,500
- You're in great, great--
- Danger?

334
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,299
Pain.

335
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:05,829
I really don't want to hurt you.
Bruises bring down the price.

336
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,519
Help!

337
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,650
But not by much.

338
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,279
Hit the cherry? Slam the cherry?

339
00:27:17,849 --> 00:27:20,690
Oh, no. Oh, dear. Stop?

340
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:24,359
Stop the demon? Red...

341
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,539
...heart...reader.

342
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,599
He was trying to describe his killer.

343
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,269
Demon...heart...reader....

344
00:27:41,849 --> 00:27:43,359
Empath demon.

345
00:27:44,849 --> 00:27:46,109
Barney.

346
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:24,589
That's too much trouble.
I'll get the eyes and dump the body.

347
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:28,619
We get an extra thousand if
the seer's eyes are intact. Drop it.

348
00:28:30,329 --> 00:28:31,490
Fine.

349
00:28:33,329 --> 00:28:36,349
- Shouldn't you be cataloging flesh?
- Yeah, whatever.

350
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,089
Cordelia!

351
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:43,980
Cordelia!

352
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,599
- This is all my fault.
- We both left her here.

353
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,230
Neither of us knew.

354
00:28:54,329 --> 00:28:58,259
I should have. All this time,
I've been tracking the wrong demon.

355
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:02,319
- If anything happens to her--
- It won't. I won't allow it.

356
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,609
This is me, looking for a clue.
Feel free to join in.

357
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:19,869
I'm a fraud.

358
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:22,910
The Council was right to sack me.

359
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,880
Yes, I was fired.

360
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:31,130
I had two. Two slayers in my care.

361
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:36,269
One turned evil and is now in a coma.
The other's a renegade.

362
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:40,259
Fire me? I'm surprised
they didn't cut my head off.

363
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,400
I'm useless.

364
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,640
A fool.

365
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:55,690
- A sniveling, great--
- Ugly, gray, blobby thing.

366
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,079
Yes, I'm an ugly, gray, blobby--
What?

367
00:30:00,329 --> 00:30:03,380
It's a sculpture by Van Gieson.
Maiden with Urn,

368
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,839
Cordelia's vision.
Could be where Barney took her.

369
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:11,710
So we ascertain this sculpture's
whereabouts, Cordelia's whereabouts.

370
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:14,750
- Then you rescue her.
- We rescue her.

371
00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:19,329
I need you. The Kungai said Barney
wanted the horn for something.

372
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,210
"Klu-Ka."

373
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:25,549
You're the only one here who can
translate that. You with me?

374
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,140
Good.

375
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,339
Got it.

376
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:39,079
Maiden with Urn was sold
to the Ramsey hotel chain in '82.

377
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:42,720
Twelve hotels around here.
It's got to be in one.

378
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:45,619
I keep finding
a translation for Klu-Ka...

379
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:49,880
...which translates as "caller sale,"
whatever that means.

380
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,299
Caller. Caller sale.

381
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:58,670
Yes, of course!
I know what Klu-Ka is.

382
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:00,869
- What?
- "Auction."

383
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:04,950
Sold! For 20,000 to number 118,
the dapper gentleman in the aisle.

384
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:09,119
Well done. You are the proud owner
of an authentic Tak horn.

385
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:12,369
Stab your enemies with it.
It'll drain the life out of them.

386
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,849
An investment in peace of mind.

387
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:19,500
Next up, lot 32.

388
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,109
We're very lucky
to have this here today...

389
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:25,250
...a rare and beautiful find.

390
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,420
I'm not a seer!
I had a vision once...

391
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,990
...and I'm sure it was
something I ate.

392
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:37,960
The magnificent eyes of a seer.

393
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,759
Your own pipeline
to The Powers That Be.

394
00:31:43,089 --> 00:31:45,970
The possibilities are endless.
Keep her as a slave...

395
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:49,250
...remove the head as a trophy
or harvest the eyes.

396
00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:51,410
In any case...

397
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:55,000
...a unique party icebreaker.
It doesn't get any better than this.

398
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:58,950
We'll start the bidding at 2000,
do I hear 2000?

399
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,519
Two thousand. Do I hear 2500?

400
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,950
Two thousand and five.
Do I hear three? Three.

401
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,160
Eight thousand, do I hear nine?
Eyes of a seer, folks.

402
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,759
I don't have to tell you
what a rare find this is.

403
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,589
Nine thousand.
Nine gets me 10.

404
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:23,779
Do I hear 10? 10,000?

405
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:26,210
Ten thousand, do I hear 10?

406
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,059
Ten thousand! Do I have 11 ?
11,000?

407
00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:32,880
Eleven thousand from
the gentleman in the back.

408
00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:34,650
Do we have 1 2?

409
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:39,579
Seer's eyes going at 11,000,
do I hear 12?

410
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,869
Ramsey Hotel, recently redecorated.

411
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,900
The Van Gieson sculpture
used to be there.

412
00:32:48,529 --> 00:32:50,529
Eleven thousand it is.

413
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,210
Going for 11,000 once, twice--

414
00:32:53,329 --> 00:32:55,150
Hey! You'd pay double for cataracts.

415
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:59,240
My eyes are flawless even without
visions! That's the best you can do?

416
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,410
I have 12,000 from the gentleman.

417
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,589
Do I hear 13? Thirteen?

418
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,759
- Going for 12,000--
- You know what these eyes can do?

419
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:16,640
They can see stuff, like danger...

420
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:21,259
...and evil, and locations
of buried treasure!

421
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:26,529
Thirteen thousand. Do I hear...?

422
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:31,079
Have some huevos, guy!
Whitey here's stepping all over you.

423
00:33:32,329 --> 00:33:34,289
You gonna take that from his kind?

424
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,910
Fourteen.

425
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:38,430
Fifteen.

426
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,650
Sixteen, 17.

427
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:42,940
- You decide,
- Eighteen.

428
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,849
Nineteen.

429
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:50,849
Twenty thousand from
the gentleman in the center!

430
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,700
Going once, going twice--

431
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:55,470
Thirty thousand!

432
00:33:57,529 --> 00:34:00,200
Sold for $30,000
to the lovely lawyer...

433
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,779
...from Wolfram and Hart.

434
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:09,940
- You'll be happy with your purchase.
- We don't need the body.

435
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,190
My employers want the eyes extracted.

436
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,329
An extraction is a very
delicate process.

437
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:19,780
We run the risk of damaging the gift.

438
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:24,119
- It'll cost you an extra thousand.
- Extraction is always included.

439
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,880
- Not seers.
- I never heard of that.

440
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:30,199
There's never been something
like this on the market.

441
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:34,579
An extra thousand
or you take it as is.

442
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,670
- Go ahead.
- Alrighty, then.

443
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,389
Hank, give me the extractor.

444
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:49,010
But.... I want to do it.
You know that!

445
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:52,360
- I've been begging--
- Hank, you're embarrassing yourself.

446
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:54,590
Hand it over.

447
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:05,840
- Convention halls?
- Downstairs.

448
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,750
- Where's the auction?
- We have no auction.

449
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:15,550
Where is it?

450
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:17,769
It's in the Tulip Room.
That way.

451
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:30,510
Be a good girl and hold still.
This will only hurt a lot.

452
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,519
The sculpture's not here.

453
00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:39,340
As usual, one step behind.

454
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,730
Hey, have you got a number?

455
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,119
Hank, stakes.

456
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,329
Get Cordelia!

457
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,579
You all right?

458
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,579
I'm so far not.

459
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,380
Right, wrists.

460
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,090
Wesley, come on!

461
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,480
Okay, let's get out of here!

462
00:36:31,409 --> 00:36:32,110
Follow me!

463
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:37,789
You!

464
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,329
Butcher an innocent girl, huh?

465
00:36:40,409 --> 00:36:42,619
I'll thrash you within an inch
of your life.

466
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,599
Then I'll take that inch!

467
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,380
Our merchandise was
taken off the market.

468
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,750
Three guesses by whom.

469
00:37:01,409 --> 00:37:03,199
Feel this, feeling-creepo!

470
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,750
I never doubted for a minute
you'd find me.

471
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:41,269
I was lucky. I had a rogue
demon hunter on my side.

472
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,329
Glad I could be of service.

473
00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:51,619
Not that he didn't have it coming.
He was a horrible, evil monster.

474
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:55,539
- He did kill a lot of people.
- Mutilated their corpses.

475
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,900
Plus, he started the bidding on me
at a paltry $2000.

476
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:04,480
This I framed for saving my life...

477
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:10,500
...and as a reminder that something
of Doyle's is here in our office.

478
00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:17,079
Well, I'll be off then.

479
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:20,849
Farewell, Angel. Who knows
when our paths will cross again.

480
00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:22,409
Wesley.

481
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:27,449
- Do you know where you're headed?
- Rogue demon hunters rarely do.

482
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:31,750
Wherever evil lurks, wherever
the dark forces threaten humanity...

483
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:35,429
- ...that's where I'll be.
- Oh, okay.

484
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:37,130
Keep in touch.

485
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:38,960
Yes.

486
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:40,969
Yes, I will.

487
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:45,130
But now, the evil lurking
everywhere bids me onwards.

488
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:50,360
So, I go.

489
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,789
- Take care!
- Yes.

490
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:02,150
No rest for the wicked fighters.

491
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:06,519
Through storm and rain, heat...

492
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:08,079
...famine...

493
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,460
...deep, painful, gnawing hunger...

494
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:15,239
- ...I go.
- Breakfast?

495
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:16,760
Ooh!

496
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:20,750
I suppose so.

497
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:25,639
One of the perks of the job: After
a night of fighting evil, we get eggs.

498
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:28,159
- Toast?
- Please.

499
00:39:28,489 --> 00:39:31,719
I'm famished. He's a good cook,
for someone on a liquid diet.

500
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:34,059
Astonishing, really.

501
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,550
Did you say something about toast?
