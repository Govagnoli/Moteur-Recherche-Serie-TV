Still, couldn't you have given him
a stern warning or something first?

00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:49,075
Oh, you did.
You... You believed in...

141
00:09:50,983 --> 00:09:54,714
I mean, you tried.
I won't forget that.

00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,515
You're welcome.

143
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:01,891
Oh, what?

144
00:10:01,994 --> 00:10:04,087
I don't get a good-bye
just because I went crazy...

145
00:10:04,196 --> 00:10:06,892
and tried to rip your throat out
while we were having sex?

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,332
Keep it simple, Harm.
It suits you.

147
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,406
This is war. Two demon clans,
the Vinjis and the Sahrvin.

148
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,569
They've been battling it out
for five generations.

149
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,670
Way back when,
clans got along okay.

Shared a few hundred miles of desert,
traded livestock...

151
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,075
and even partied together
once in a while.

152
00:10:27,186 --> 00:10:30,553
Then a Vinji used the wrong fork
at a Sahrvin bonding ceremony.

153
00:10:30,656 --> 00:10:34,319
<i>Sahrvins took offense, and they've been</i>
<i>slaughtering each other ever since.</i>

154
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,054
You're saying this whole thing
started over a fork faux pas?

155
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:38,925
They're pretty finicky about manners.

156
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:41,465
But the clans have agreed
to negotiate a truce...

157
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:44,001
- Here, tomorrow.
- Why now?

158
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,332
Demon rights activist by the name
ofTobias Dupree got involved.

159
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,805
He's liaison to both clans...
only guy in the world they all trust.

160
00:10:49,908 --> 00:10:51,808
And he called us for help.

161
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,346
Etiquette aside,
the Vinji and Sahrvin are notoriously vicious.

162
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,608
Why not let them
wipe each other out?

163
00:10:57,716 --> 00:11:00,446
I got no love for these guys.
But we manage to push through a peace plan...

164
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:02,452
the whole demon world's
gonna know we got game.

165
00:11:02,554 --> 00:11:07,787
That makes sense, in a kind of gray,
Machiavellian kind of way.

166
00:11:07,893 --> 00:11:09,793
Obviously, both clans are
sensitive to the smallest slight.

167
00:11:09,895 --> 00:11:13,763
<i>We don't dot an "l"or cross a "T,"</i>
<i>this whole thing could explode in our faces.</i>

168
00:11:13,866 --> 00:11:16,266
<i>This is a complete list</i>
<i>of manners and customs.</i>

169
00:11:16,368 --> 00:11:18,336
We should probably all memorize this.

170
00:11:18,437 --> 00:11:22,430
<i>Apparently, gazing at a Vinji's ankles</i>
<i>can lead to eye-gouging.</i>

171
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,406
Ah. Hey, come on, Dandido.
Come on.

172
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:28,412
<i>[Chuckles] He gets a wee shy</i>
<i>around the big boss. All the way in, yeah.</i>

173
00:11:28,514 --> 00:11:30,812
<i>I, uh, finished the seating chart.</i>

174
00:11:33,685 --> 00:11:37,781
<i>All right. This kid was up all night,</i>
<i>jigsawing who's going where tomorrow.</i>

175
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,915
He's a real up-and-comer, this one.

176
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:44,155
<i>[Fred] My lab managed that upgrade to</i>
<i>the weapons scanner, like you requested.</i>

177
00:11:44,263 --> 00:11:46,163
- Foolproof?
- I'd say yes...

178
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:48,927
but then some fool would just come along
and sneak something past us.

179
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:50,934
But it's still state of the art.

180
00:11:51,036 --> 00:11:53,436
And since none of the clan
representatives speak English...

181
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:56,167
- I'll be doing most of the talking.
- You?

182
00:11:56,275 --> 00:11:58,675
Yeah. Along with the law
and the Gilbert and Sullivan...

183
00:11:58,777 --> 00:12:01,143
also got me a few demon languages
in the brain upload.

184
00:12:01,246 --> 00:12:04,807
<i>So aside from forks, ankles</i>
<i>and us not knowing what they're saying...</i>

185
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:06,817
any other potential minefields?

186
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,184
All their etiquette issues go along
with a healthy dose of superstition.

187
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:14,089
You don't know the half of it. I've been doing
a whole bunch of research on these guys...

188
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,422
their customs and stuff.

189
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:19,588
Did you know that they think poodles
are wicked bad luck?

190
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,996
Harmony, I'm glad you're here.

191
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,500
- We'll be needing lunch.
<i>- [Gunn] Good idea.</i>

192
00:12:24,603 --> 00:12:26,935
<i>- We should order before the crush.</i>
<i>- [Fred] Not Thai again.</i>

193
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,939
- [Sighs]
<i>- Something lighter.</i>

194
00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:33,774
[Woman]
<i>Burkle's always giving Mr. Gunn the eye.</i>

195
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,347
<i>- I heard they used to be a thing.</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

196
00:12:36,448 --> 00:12:39,144
Alice said she and that Knox guy
are pretty friendly.

197
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:41,446
<i>Maybe she's sleeping with both of'em.</i>

198
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,646
[Giggles]
That's what I'd do.

199
00:12:43,755 --> 00:12:48,488
Don't forget about Wesley. I get the vibe
that he's, like, totally crushing over Fred.

200
00:12:48,594 --> 00:12:50,789
Mr. Wyndam-Pryce?

201
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:53,160
[Huffs]
Everyone knows he's... Muffins!

202
00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:55,790
They're from Lorne... actually from Shaq...

203
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:58,335
but Lorne's declared his office
a carb-free zone.

204
00:12:58,437 --> 00:13:00,803
- He's totally grooming you.
<i>- You think?</i>

205
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:03,136
He does call me "Dan the Man."

206
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:06,870
- Angel grooms me too.
- Explains the haircut.

207
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:10,244
I'm his right arm. He's taking me places.

208
00:13:10,349 --> 00:13:13,978
<i>- [Ringing]</i>
- We're so connected.

209
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:16,855
- Yeah, boss?
- Harmony, get the hell down here. Now!

210
00:13:16,855 --> 00:13:18,584
- Yeah, boss?
- Harmony, get the hell down here. Now!

211
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,250
Uh, sure. No. No, trouble at all.

212
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,488
That's what I'm here for. Bye.

213
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:30,160
Harmony!

214
00:13:32,704 --> 00:13:34,672
You want to explain this?

215
00:13:35,707 --> 00:13:39,108
Okay. This is totally my fault.

216
00:13:39,211 --> 00:13:42,738
I specifically told the caterers
the delivery was for tomorrow.

217
00:13:42,848 --> 00:13:45,078
<i>But I should've called to confirm.</i>

218
00:13:45,183 --> 00:13:47,777
<i>You know caterers...</i>
<i>not the best listeners.</i>

219
00:13:47,886 --> 00:13:49,786
- Oh!
- [Bellows]

220
00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:52,584
Harmony, uh, got us a camel.

221
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:55,387
Like I said, I did a lot of research.

222
00:13:55,494 --> 00:13:57,758
Camel meat's a delicacy.

223
00:13:57,863 --> 00:14:00,559
So I thought it would be a great way
to kick off the summit...

224
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,531
'cause of the clans being so uptight.

225
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,932
Like... comfort food.

226
00:14:05,037 --> 00:14:06,470
- Comfort food?
- Uh-huh.

227
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:09,267
And as host,
you get the honor of slicing off its hump...

228
00:14:09,374 --> 00:14:11,274
and sticking a hot poker
through its heart.

229
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:15,437
And then the demon leaders
rip apart its carcass with their bare hands.

230
00:14:15,547 --> 00:14:17,879
[Chuckles]
Are you...

231
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:20,247
<i>[Sighs]</i>
<i>I don't even know h-how...</i>

232
00:14:20,352 --> 00:14:23,412
Uh, maybe the camel
was the wrong way to go.

233
00:14:23,522 --> 00:14:26,923
You were supposed to answer the phones,
make appointments and anticipate my needs...

234
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:30,654
which does not include
a petting zoo in my lobby.

235
00:14:30,762 --> 00:14:33,754
Okay, but...
the caterer said no returns.

236
00:14:33,865 --> 00:14:35,765
- [Snorts]
- Get it out of here.

237
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,164
Maybe you could
go with a nice cheese platter.

238
00:14:40,272 --> 00:14:42,001
[Crying]

239
00:14:42,107 --> 00:14:45,634
Or chips and dip.
Chips and dip would be fine.

240
00:14:46,878 --> 00:14:49,847
I did everything right.
This is what they eat.

241
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:52,610
Angel's just feeling a little off...

242
00:14:52,718 --> 00:14:57,485
and he-he's not in the mood to,
you know, butcher a camel.

243
00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:01,218
- No, he hates me!
- No!

244
00:15:01,326 --> 00:15:03,157
He'll get over it.

245
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:05,195
Everybody hates me.

246
00:15:05,297 --> 00:15:08,130
L... I don't hate you.

247
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:11,828
- [Sniffles]
- I mean, it's just I don't know you that well, and...

248
00:15:11,937 --> 00:15:13,996
What are you doing after work?

249
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:16,301
[Bellows]

250
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:20,578
And the worst part is,
I can't even quit.

251
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,738
I don't have
anywhere else to go.

252
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:25,248
<i>I'm sure that's not...</i>

253
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,079
Really?

254
00:15:27,185 --> 00:15:31,087
I tried being out on my own,
all independent and evil.

255
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:35,922
- I'm just no good at it.
<i>- But... But, I mean, isn't that a good thing?</i>

256
00:15:36,027 --> 00:15:38,188
Not like everything's
so great now.

257
00:15:38,296 --> 00:15:41,060
You heard Angel.
I'm useless.

258
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,066
Harmony, it was one mistake.

259
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:46,660
And you can't take everything
Angel says so personally.

260
00:15:46,772 --> 00:15:50,367
He... He has a lot on his mind.

261
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:54,036
[Sighs]
I just wish I were more like you.

262
00:15:54,146 --> 00:15:56,637
You know, except for the part
about being all into science...

263
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,648
and not having a lot up front.

264
00:16:00,018 --> 00:16:03,681
I mean,
you have two hot guys after you.

265
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:05,586
I do?

266
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,215
All the girls,
they think it's Knox and Gunn.

267
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:11,523
Of course, I know it's Knox and Wesley.
Not that they'd listen.

268
00:16:12,664 --> 00:16:14,723
It is Knox and Wes, right?

269
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:19,099
Yeah. I mean, no!
L... I don't know.

270
00:16:19,204 --> 00:16:23,163
We all work together,
and there's a lot of baggage and...

271
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,175
Why am I telling you this?

272
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:27,609
Because we're totally bonding.

273
00:16:27,712 --> 00:16:30,203
We're, like, gal pals.
This is awesome.

274
00:16:30,315 --> 00:16:34,012
You can teach me about life,
and I can teach you how to dress better.

275
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,383
Oh.

276
00:16:36,488 --> 00:16:38,456
[Giggles]

277
00:16:38,557 --> 00:16:40,923
They are both kinda hot,
aren't they?

278
00:16:41,026 --> 00:16:43,085
Knox and Wes. L...

279
00:16:43,195 --> 00:16:47,757
Wait. Why is everyone at the office
so interested in who I might be dating?

280
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:51,927
Because you're at the top. People want to
know what's happening with the bigwigs.

281
00:16:52,037 --> 00:16:53,937
You'd think they'd ask me, but...

282
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:56,599
- Why don't they?
- [Sighs]

283
00:16:56,708 --> 00:17:01,042
Harmony, do you...
do you not have many friends at work?

284
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,380
I just... I don't get it.

285
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:07,246
I used to be way popular
in high school.

286
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:09,115
[Sighs]

287
00:17:09,221 --> 00:17:11,121
Just since I got vamped
at my graduation...

288
00:17:11,223 --> 00:17:13,418
I've had trouble
connecting with people.

289
00:17:13,525 --> 00:17:16,585
Well, maybe you should...

290
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:20,062
you know,
put yourself out there more.

291
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:23,566
I mean, lots of Wolfram and Hart people
hang out right here.

292
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,136
- You should mingle.
- They're all straight.

293
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:30,436
Nonvamps.

294
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:33,136
I gravitate more towards
the undead variety.

295
00:17:33,245 --> 00:17:35,145
Well, there's your problem.

296
00:17:35,247 --> 00:17:37,408
The undead,
they're not exactly givers.

297
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:41,508
I'm sure there are tons of straight guys
who would love to get to know you.

298
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,248
Well, there is one at the bar.

299
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:46,586
Don't!

300
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,454
I think he's checking me out.

301
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,460
You should go talk to him.

302
00:17:50,562 --> 00:17:52,826
Oh, no. I couldn't.

303
00:17:52,931 --> 00:17:54,956
I'm hanging with my gal pal.

304
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:57,261
I would never do that to you.

305
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:00,429
- Don't be silly. I'd be fine if...
- Okay. Bye.

306
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,503
Oh, what do I say?

307
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:07,704
Oh, um, just say "Hi"
and introduce yourself.

308
00:18:07,812 --> 00:18:10,042
I bet he takes it from there.

309
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:13,879
Right. But what if he doesn't take it?

310
00:18:13,985 --> 00:18:16,715
Well, questions are always good.

311
00:18:16,821 --> 00:18:19,449
Ask him where he's from
and what he does for a living.

312
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,218
Cover the boring stuff.

313
00:18:21,326 --> 00:18:23,692
Only maybe act like it's not...

314
00:18:24,796 --> 00:18:25,990
boring.

315
00:18:26,097 --> 00:18:27,799
I can do that.
[Giggles]

316
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:28,697
I can do that.
[Giggles]

317
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,394
Well, don't watch me.

318
00:18:31,503 --> 00:18:33,630
I'll just, um...

319
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,638
I'll just go.

320
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,970
Hi.

321
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,840
- I'm Harmony.
- Well, hi, Harmony. It's nice to meet you.

322
00:18:40,946 --> 00:18:43,312
Where are you from?

323
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,144
- The Bay Area originally, but...
- Uh-huh.

324
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,241
Interesting.
[Nervous Giggle]

325
00:18:47,352 --> 00:18:49,343
What do you do for a living?

326
00:18:50,522 --> 00:18:53,218
Why don't I get you a drink?

327
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:55,657
You look thirsty.

328
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:05,098
- [Alarm Buzzer]
- [Rock]

329
00:19:06,738 --> 00:19:08,763
- [Buzzer Stops]

00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:22,045
if I didn't have a really good reason.

666
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:24,143
It's just...

667
00:39:24,254 --> 00:39:26,552
I was scared and...

668
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:35,396
I know you never wanted me
as your assistant, and...

669
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:37,091
<i>[Sighs]</i>

670
00:39:37,201 --> 00:39:40,193
Okay, I've made some bad choices.

671
00:39:40,304 --> 00:39:44,001
I mean, it's not like I have a soul.
I have to try a lot harder.

672
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,671
[Wesley]
How's it going in there?

673
00:39:48,779 --> 00:39:52,180
Well, so far no heads are rollin'.
How about in here?

674
00:39:52,282 --> 00:39:54,182
<i>Harmony could have</i>
<i>handled it better...</i>

675
00:39:54,284 --> 00:39:56,445
<i>but she didn't kill anyone.</i>

676
00:39:58,555 --> 00:40:03,083
You'll be clean in two days.
But I'll be watchin' you.

677
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,763
I know.

678
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,924
He won't
have to be watching, 'cause...

679
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:16,661
I'll just pack up my desk.

680
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:23,509
<i>Harmony...</i>

681
00:40:23,614 --> 00:40:26,174
just bring us some coffee.

682
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:37,626
<i>So I saved the summit</i>
<i>by killing the skank who tried to frame me...</i>

683
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:39,958
and all I get is,
"Get me some coffee."

684
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,122
You believe that?

685
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:45,963
Oh. Hey, can I get another,
but with one of those little umbrellas?

686
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,970
<i>- We're out.</i>
- Right. Figures.

687
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,700
Yeah, life's
an ever-lovin' bitch, isn't it?

688
00:40:51,808 --> 00:40:56,040
- What are you doing here?
- At the moment, hearin' a bit of your story of woe.

689
00:40:56,146 --> 00:40:58,637
But what happened to Europe?

690
00:40:58,749 --> 00:41:01,684
Aren't you supposed to be
Slayer-chasing or something?

691
00:41:01,785 --> 00:41:04,982
I was on my way. [Sighs]
Had a boat ticket and all.

692
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:07,318
Then I put a little thinkin' into it.

693
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:11,588
[Huffs] A man can't go out
in a bloody blaze of glory, savin' the world...

694
00:41:11,695 --> 00:41:13,390
<i>and then show up</i>
<i>three months later...</i>

695
00:41:13,497 --> 00:41:15,727
tumbling off a cruise ship
in the south of France.

696
00:41:15,832 --> 00:41:19,097
<i>I mean, I'd love to,</i>
<i>don't get me wrong.</i>

697
00:41:19,202 --> 00:41:22,899
But, uh, it's hard
to top an exit like that.

698
00:41:23,006 --> 00:41:26,601
Come on.
Girls don't care about stuff like that.

699
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:30,612
Just one look at you,
and she'll forget herself.

700
00:41:30,714 --> 00:41:35,014
She'll get all tingly, and it won't matter
how horribly you treated her in the past...

701
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:37,018
and how you took her
for granted, and...

702
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,951
Hey, I never took her for gr...

703
00:41:40,524 --> 00:41:42,458
Oh.

704
00:41:45,562 --> 00:41:47,462
[Exhales Deeply]

705
00:41:47,564 --> 00:41:50,397
Well, I'd expect Buffy
would be happy enough to see me.

706
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,061
It's just I gave up my life for her,
the world...

707
00:41:54,171 --> 00:41:56,469
<i>and if I show up now, flesh and bone...</i>

708
00:41:56,573 --> 00:42:00,475
a grand finale
won't hold much weight.

709
00:42:00,577 --> 00:42:04,138
All of it won't matter.

710
00:42:06,116 --> 00:42:08,744
Yeah. Not mattering.

711
00:42:08,852 --> 00:42:11,753
[Sighs]
I know that feeling well.

712
00:42:11,855 --> 00:42:13,880
Oh, come on, Harm.
You matter to someone.

713
00:42:16,193 --> 00:42:19,094
- I do?
- Yeah.

714
00:42:19,196 --> 00:42:22,290
Girl tried to frame you, didn't she?
Must've mattered to her.

715
00:42:22,399 --> 00:42:24,594
<i>Everybody's talking about it.</i>

716
00:42:24,701 --> 00:42:27,431
You're right.

717
00:42:27,537 --> 00:42:31,268
That girl hated me.
She wanted me dead.

718
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:35,842
- I matter.
- Yeah.

719
00:43:18,321 --> 00:43:20,653
Grr! Arrgh!
