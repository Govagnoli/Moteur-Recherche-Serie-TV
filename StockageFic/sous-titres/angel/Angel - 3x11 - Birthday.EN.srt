1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:04,419
- Previously:
- I'm gonna have a son.

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,089
I have a roommate. He's a ghost.

3
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:13,320
When I see you
and Cordelia sparring...

4
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:17,089
...it's only natural you and she
will be drawn to one another.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,649
She doesn't choose to have a vision.
The Powers send them.

6
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:22,250
I look forward to my next vision.

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,890
You gonna be okay?

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,210
These visions are killing me.

9
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:31,309
If I lose the visions,
I wouldn't be able to help you.

10
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:33,049
You wouldn't need me.

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,759
I'd just like to say thank you.

12
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:43,240
You believed in me
when no one else would.

13
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:46,350
In my darkest hours,
you were there for me...

14
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:50,299
...and that means more to me
than you'll ever know.

15
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,520
I guess what I'm really
trying to say is, I love you.

16
00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:00,219
To all my fans, this is for you!

17
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,859
Wow! That was just....

18
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:07,209
Wow. And with the tears....

19
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,890
I got chill bumps all up my arms.

20
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,670
Yep, that's the famous speech.

21
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,670
Not that I'll ever use it, of course.

22
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:21,140
Unless they start handing out
awards for best slime and grime.

23
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,950
Next time Angel decides
to blow something up...

24
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,810
...he's cleaning his own scorch marks.

25
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,209
Ladies, less yammer and more scrub.

26
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,579
My, Gunn...

27
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,239
...don't you look sterile.

28
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,849
Couple more hours sniffing
that cleanser, and I might be.

29
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:41,700
You wanna trade jobs?

30
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:45,540
Scrape up Wolfram and Hart's
entrails off floor. Fred?

31
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:48,859
You're screwed.

32
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,920
- Wes back yet?
- Nope.

33
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,180
He's still picking up more
extra-strength ick remover.

34
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,560
Look who's up from his nap.

35
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,439
Connor.

36
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,689
Whoa, whoa.
Dirty people not touching the baby.

37
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,259
But pig-drinking
bloodsuckers are okay?

38
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:15,539
I meant that in a nice way.
I'm washing my hands.

39
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:17,550
I get first dibs
on baby snuggles.

40
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:21,539
Don't forget to get under your
fingernails. Does she know?

41
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,400
Where is she?

42
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,340
You guys,
I can't believe you did this.

43
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:57,360
Don't just stand there,
blow out the candles, girl.

44
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,789
Yeah!

45
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,449
- Did you make a wish?
- I did. Jude Law was busy?

46
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,120
How disappointing.

47
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:10,909
- Guess you won't be wanting presents--
- Oh, wanting. Wanting presents.

48
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:15,680
- Do you want to hold the baby now?
- Let me have him.

49
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,879
Thank you. Oh, honey.

50
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,759
I, uh....

51
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,419
I got you a little something.

52
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:33,150
You didn't have to.
You have enough to take care of.

53
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:36,889
Well, I'm a champion.
We do important stuff.

54
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,699
- Who's more important than--?
- Forgive the wrapping.

55
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,370
Some of us seem to have
an addiction to tape.

56
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,030
What a cruel dilemma.
Presents or sweet little baby?

57
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:54,360
- Take the baby.
- You choose gifts over my kid?

58
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:57,539
Take the baby. Take the baby!

59
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,500
It's a teenager. A girl. She's....

60
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,580
Cordy!

61
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:14,099
Is she all right?

62
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,350
- I'm fine, you guys.
- Cordy?

63
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,019
I'll be okay. I'm just....

64
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,410
- Can you hear me?
- Is she breathing?

65
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:28,360
Dead?

66
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,149
Oh, no.

67
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:24,850
Take him.

68
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,310
Come on, Cordy, wake up.
It's all over.

69
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,310
- Come back to us.
- I haven't gone anywhere.

70
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,829
- Wake up.
- Is she--?

71
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,660
- No!
- I'm not?

72
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:37,079
- Her heart's beating.
- Yes!

73
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:40,500
- But if I'm not dead--
- She's in a trance, or a coma.

74
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,579
- Like hell I am!
- Let's get her to the couch.

75
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,680
- Easy. Easy
- All right.

76
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,540
Okay, I get it.

77
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,910
This is some kind of bizarre birthday
present you guys cooked up.

78
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,800
All right, joke's on me.
Now put me back in my body.

79
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,209
It was a vision, wasn't it?

80
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:07,930
She started saying something
about a girl and--

81
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,490
That's right. She's in a house
on Oak Street in Reseda.

82
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,199
It feels like we have
some time here, but....

83
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,620
You can't hear me at all, can you?

84
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:22,750
- What's all the hubbub, bub?
- Lorne. Thank God.

85
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:28,250
If there's some weird other worldly
thing going on, you'd still be able to--

86
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,980
Oh, that's not good.
Did anybody else just see that?

87
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,939
- Jumping Judas, what happened?
- We know she had a vision.

88
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:40,050
There's a lot we don't know.
She dropped this.

89
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:42,449
Put that away.
That's not important.

90
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,529
- Seltrax.
- Oh, God.

91
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,790
- What's Seltrax?
- Nothing.

92
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,120
It's a powerful migraine medication.

93
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:53,279
- We should get her to a hospital.
- So they can tell us there's no hope?

94
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,290
Angel's right. Seltrax is potent,
but it doesn't cause catatonia.

95
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,509
I'm picking up some hard-core
woo-woo vibes.

96
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,509
This ain't medical, kids.
It's mystical.

97
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,370
There's so much we don't know.

98
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,860
If she's taking a drug
this powerful in secret...

99
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,610
...the visions are more damaging
than she lets on.

100
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,209
- This one must've overloaded her.
- She'll come out of it.

101
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,459
- She will!
- If it's a mystical problem...

102
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,139
- ...there's a mystical solution.
- Great idea.

103
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:28,000
- Gunn and Fred, go to Cordy's place.
- No! Bad idea. Bad idea.

104
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,399
See if she's been hiding anything.
Wes?

105
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:33,589
- I'll hit the books.
- I'll take the peanut.

106
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:36,769
Does nobody care
that there is a girl in Reseda...

107
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,680
...that is about to be fed
to a no-eyed, three-mouth monster?

108
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,149
What?

109
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:47,750
Hello?

110
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:53,490
A message. I'll leave a message.

111
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:06,680
I think Phantom Dennis
expected the birthday girl.

112
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,050
Hi, there.

113
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:11,910
I know we haven't been
formally introduced.

114
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:15,860
I'm not sure how to introduce
myself to someone who's...

115
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:20,060
...you know, former. But, I'm Fred.

116
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,930
It's nice to meet you.

117
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:24,819
Fred, you are so cool.

118
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,170
I think we should tell him.

119
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,480
Okay.

120
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,860
You might wanna....

121
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,909
Do ghosts sit down?

122
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,259
Wesley. Wesley.

123
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:41,909
Wesley! Yoo-hoo!

124
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,909
But if she's in the astral plane, she
could be here, unable to communicate.

125
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,940
Yeah, here. Unable to communicate.

126
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:58,279
"Astral Projection." I should read up.

127
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,070
Wait, don't turn--

128
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:04,320
- It doesn't make any sense.
- What doesn't?

129
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:06,049
It's all...

130
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:08,450
...normal.

131
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,519
- And that's wrong?
- No.

132
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:16,600
What's wrong is you picking
through Cordy's personal...

133
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,360
...support things.

134
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,450
What, this?

135
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,700
Come on, you never hid anything
in your underwear drawer?

136
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,799
I don't know. I mean, for five years
I didn't even have--

137
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,220
Can we not talk about
my underwear, please?

138
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,059
And put that down.

139
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:39,649
If Cordy was taking
something like Seltrax...

140
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:42,370
...she'd have tried other stuff first.

141
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,029
But there's not even any aspirin
in here.

142
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,639
I think he's protecting her.

143
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,919
Phantom Dennis?

144
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,480
Listen, we would never ask you
to betray Cordelia...

145
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,870
...but we need to see whatever
she's been hiding--

146
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:11,509
Unless you so hype on the ghosting
life that you want her to join you.

147
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:23,509
You looked through the underwear
drawer first, didn't you?

148
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:26,870
The date on this prescription...

149
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,700
...it's from a year ago.

150
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:41,029
Cordy, look, I know you can't hear me,
but there's something I have to say.

151
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,870
You really piss me off, you know that?

152
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,860
I thought we trusted each other,
but you've been lying. MRIs?

153
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:57,139
CAT scans?
It's been going on for over a year?

154
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:00,740
Why couldn't you let me in?
I could've helped you.

155
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,220
- God, you make me so furious.
- You're furious?

156
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:10,649
I get body-jacked on my birthday,
and you're the one that's furious?

157
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,580
Knock-knock.

158
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,049
- How is she?
- The same.

159
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,169
- You ready?
- As I'll ever be.

160
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,110
For what?

161
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,269
- What's he gonna do?
- I wish I'd brought my helmet.

162
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,200
Last time I got blown across the room.

163
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,639
Oh, God, please let this work.

164
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:41,399
Cordelia, are you there?

165
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,940
It's me, Lorne. I'm here.

166
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:47,580
- Cordelia?
- Yes!

167
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:50,580
171 Oak Street.

168
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:54,039
Can you hear me? Lorne?

169
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,220
- What?
- Cordelia's not in there.

170
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:04,049
- She's just gone.
- I'm standing right in front of you.

171
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,779
- Listen, I'm afraid.
- No. This isn't gonna happen.

172
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:16,019
I don't care how many favors
you call in or gods you cross.

173
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,759
You're connected to The Powers That
Be. Find me a way to talk to them.

174
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,220
Angel, honey, it's not that easy.

175
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:28,049
Contacting The Powers is a muddy,
not to mention dangerous, area.

176
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,480
But this is a bit much to ask.

177
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,600
I'm not asking.

178
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,860
Finally!

179
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:06,649
Okay, Wes, let's hope your books
know what they're talking about.

180
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:54,080
Listen up, whatever you are!
You can't scare me.

181
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,440
Angel. I just--

182
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:02,730
- Why are you on the floor?
- I had this dream that Cordy was here.

183
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,820
She was trying to tell me something.
Something important.

184
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:10,279
- Yes, and, and....
- It's weird.

185
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:15,049
How are you a champion?
In what way are you a champion?

186
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,970
Fred studied Cordy's CAT scans.
The news isn't good.

187
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,070
They show widespread
neuroelectrical deterioration.

188
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:26,240
- That's just a fancy way of saying--
- She's dying.

189
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,970
I think I like the fancy way better.

190
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,090
I'm working on the mystical aspect.

191
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,610
Trance states, astral projection,
spiritual possession.

192
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,509
But so far, I haven't been able to....

193
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,450
Why don't you take a break?
I'll watch her and Connor.

194
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,980
I'm not ready yet.

195
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:06,830
No.

196
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:19,570
Hey. How's it going?

197
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,860
You're....

198
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,230
You're Death?

199
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,649
You've come to take me.

200
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:39,710
Kidding. I'm Skip.

201
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:45,029
You're Cordelia Chase, right?
Sorry it took me so long-- This you?

202
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:54,389
Most people's spiritual shapes tend to
be an idealized version of themselves.

203
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:59,570
Straighten the nose, lose the gray.
Sort of a self-esteem kind of thing.

204
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,490
You're pretty confident.

205
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:05,220
What is this? Who are you?
What the hell is going on?!

206
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,840
You got questions. I get that.

207
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:10,490
I'll answer them.
But we gotta get out of here.

208
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:14,720
But why? Here's good.
I feel comfortable here. I like here.

209
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:20,259
But you see, there's a slight problem.
You don't belong here anymore.

210
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,720
- Because I'm dead?
- Not yet.

211
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,039
But you will be, very soon.

212
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,360
Unless you come with me.

213
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,809
Well, I'll follow you
on one condition.

214
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:39,850
Tell my friends about
this vision that I had.

215
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:45,389
Sorry, no can do. I'm not a messenger,
I'm just a guide.

216
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,899
- I don't want to die.
- So don't.

217
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,210
That's from eight months ago.

218
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,960
The red spots, or what
they call hot areas...

219
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,220
...are what you'd expect
from a healthy, functioning brain.

220
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,700
- This one is dated one month ago.
- Cordy's doctors couldn't explain it.

221
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:22,119
See, green is a cold color, usually
signifying dead areas of the cerebrum.

222
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,930
- Normally, you wouldn't see that--
- Unless the person was a cucumber.

223
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,650
How could we not know?

224
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,309
For the love of God,
somebody get me a Sea Breeze.

225
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,980
- Lorne, what happened?
- I can't really talk about it.

226
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,589
Then how we supposed to find them?

227
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,700
I mean, I can't talk about it.
They cast a spell.

228
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,970
I went down to the--
See?

229
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,519
- Did you get the information?
- Why, yes. My horn should grow back.

230
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,059
So kind of you to be concerned.

231
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,559
Well, they didn't say
I couldn't write it.

232
00:18:00,089 --> 00:18:02,859
All kidding aside,
this isn't to be taken lightly.

233
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,170
Only a champion can deal with
the Conduit. Even then, you--

234
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,890
I'll keep that in mind.

235
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,890
Is this...?

236
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,079
- This is a mall.
- We figured you'd be comfortable.

237
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,680
- We?
- The Powers That Be.

238
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,039
The Powers That Be popped me out
of my body and sent me to a mall?

239
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:31,210
This is more a construct of a mall.
You know, like in The Matrix.

240
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,420
- You saw The Matrix?
- Love that flick.

241
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,559
When Trinity's all, "Dodge this,"
and the agent....

242
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,799
And I'm not really instilling
any awe anymore, am I?

243
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,960
Why did you bring me here?

244
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,160
To give you a choice.
But we'll get to that later.

245
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:50,690
There's something I want you to see.

246
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,059
Oh, my God.

247
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,890
Doyle.

248
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,910
That's what happened.
Big, cosmic whoops.

249
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,660
Doyle wasn't meant
to give you visions.

250
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:13,059
- Then why did The Powers let him?
- They usually catch that sort of thing.

251
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,660
What they didn't count on
were his feelings for you.

252
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,750
You mean, Doyle gave me the visions
because he loved me?

253
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:28,630
I can't answer that.
I can tell you that it was a mistake.

254
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:33,579
I thought The Powers That Be
knew everything.

255
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,190
Life and death, they got a handle on.

256
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,819
Who someone chooses to love,
well, that's just free will.

257
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,269
You see, Cordelia, the visions
are an ancient powerful force.

258
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:46,809
Only demons can withstand them.

259
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,150
I've had them for more than two years.
Doesn't that mean I'm strong?

260
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:55,950
Strong, yes. Demon, no.
Just ask Tammy here.

261
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,910
- Tammy where?
- Hello, miss.

262
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:04,490
This is Tammy.
She had the visions back in-- 163O?

263
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,440
Aye. Had them well nigh on a year.
And a hellish year it was too.

264
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:13,099
Town fathers called me a witch.
Wanted to burn me at the stake.

265
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,150
- They killed you because you had visions?
- No, miss. They didn't have to.

266
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,059
Last vision I had blew out
the back of me skull.

267
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:27,299
Humans wasn't meant
to have the visions.

268
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:31,349
If you want my advice,
you'll listen to our man Skip here.

269
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,579
- He won't steer you wrong, this one.
- Oh, get out of here.

270
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:40,210
Really. Get out. I've got work.

271
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,920
You okay?

272
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:56,410
Thanks, Lorne.

273
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:01,799
It is come, The champion
has come, Come for what?

274
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,109
Answers not to be had,
Death is certain,

275
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,829
Death awaits,

276
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,430
- I wanna talk to the Conduit.
- We are the Conduit,

277
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,309
The gateway, the all-times, the ever,
It wishes to speak to us,

278
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,140
Yes, it does.
You gonna show yourselves?

279
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,259
We are unseen, formless,
It speaks unknowing, Send it away,

280
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,420
I'm not going anywhere till I get my
message to The Powers That Be.

281
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:32,750
My friend Cordelia has visions
given to her by The Powers.

282
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:39,670
They're killing her. I want The Powers
to take them back.

283
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:44,190
Let her go. She's suffered enough.

284
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,920
Suffering,

285
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:49,839
Does it know suffering?

286
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,369
Yes, it does,

287
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,720
The Powers owe nothing,
Send it away, Send it away,

288
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,619
I'm not finished.

289
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:06,000
Ever had the vague sensation
you left the oven on?

290
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,200
Or that you were supposed to call
someone, you just forgot who?

291
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,299
Have you ever felt that way
about your acting career?

292
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:19,200
- I don't have an acting career.
- Which brings me to my next point.

293
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:23,759
I remember that night.

294
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,920
You'd been in L.A. a few months,
things were lean...

295
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:30,079
...and who should you run into?

296
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:35,259
Your life changed that night,
in ways you couldn't imagine.

297
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:38,619
Indescribably painful ways,
you'll agree.

298
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:42,500
Now, what if the play
ran a little different?

299
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,059
You're on the sideline, here,
talking to wannabe moguls.

300
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:51,490
Angel is downfield here. Instead of
cutting to the middle to meet him...

301
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,569
...what if you'd been
forced to counter?

302
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:58,059
What if this guy,
a very powerful talent agent...

303
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:01,480
...flanks you and drew you offsides?
What would happen?

304
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:06,140
- I'd score a touchdown?
- Metaphorically speaking, heck yeah.

305
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:12,529
Inside every living thing there is
a connection to The Powers That Be.

306
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:15,390
Call it instinct, intuition.

307
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,529
Deep down, we all know
our purpose in this world.

308
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:22,170
Are you saying I was meant
to be an actress?

309
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:27,700
No. I'm saying you were meant to be an
incredibly famous and wealthy actress.

310
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,960
- The Powers That Be can make it happen.
- They can turn back time?

311
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:38,079
They don't go for that much.
Think of it as writing over history.

312
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:41,690
You could live the life
you've always wanted.

313
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:47,430
No monsters, no visions, no dying.
Well, not for a long time, anyway.

314
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,619
But no Angel.

315
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,039
Cordelia, I want you to listen to me.

316
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:58,059
If you go back inside your body,
you won't wake up.

317
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,720
You will lie there, unable to move,
unable to speak...

318
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:06,279
...until the next vision hits you
and then you will die.

319
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:09,359
But that's not fair.

320
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:14,359
How will Angel know to save that
girl if I don't tell him where she is?

321
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:16,740
He needs me.

322
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,349
Let's go in here.

323
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:29,190
Its pleas are pointless, Her
path is chosen, We will not interfere,

324
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:33,039
She's not strong enough
to handle the visions.

325
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:37,589
- It speaks and does not listen,
- No, you're not listening!

326
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:43,089
Cordelia's not a champion. She's a
rich girl who likes to play superhero.

327
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:48,630
She doesn't have what it takes
to do this. Don't The Powers get that?

328
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,579
Stop whispering and listen to me,
damn it! She's weak.

329
00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:56,900
Skip, get me out of here, now.

330
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,609
You're killing her.

331
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:06,559
She's unconscious, and she's alone.
Who knows if she's in pain?

332
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:10,170
It is angry, It is afraid,

333
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:16,170
I'm more afraid of her dying
than she is.

334
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:19,559
What is that?

335
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,150
Cordelia, are you sure?

336
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,180
You gave me a choice,
so I'm choosing.

337
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:31,519
Okay, kid, here goes.
I'm gonna make you a star.

338
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,349
And now, ladies and gentlemen,,,

339
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,589
... the two-time Emmy-winning
star of our show...

340
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:45,529
... the gal with the million-dollar
smile, Cordelia Chase!

341
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:03,240
One, two, three, four.

342
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:41,390
- Great show, Cordy.
- Thanks.

343
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,069
There are stars and there are stars,
then there is you.

344
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,720
Am I paying you enough?

345
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:48,730
- Well--
- Good. What's cooking?

346
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:53,000
You got a costume fitting.
Producers want to run ideas by you.

347
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,230
Hi. What's your name?

348
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,400
We wanna record that breast
cancer PSA next week.

349
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:02,069
No, make it tomorrow.
Do you ever get that feeling...

350
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,980
...you should be doing something,
but you can't remember what?

351
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,599
No. I'm organized.
That's why you pay me well.

352
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:12,480
- But with the holidays coming--
- I have to go, I'm sorry.

353
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:16,609
I want something.
Hypo-something.... Hypothermia....

354
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,069
Get ice water in Miss Chase's
dressing room.

355
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,049
- That's not it.
- Canceling.

356
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,680
- Hyper.... Hyperbaric?
- Josh, make it an oxygen tent.

357
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:27,349
- That's not it.
- Canceling.

358
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:29,529
- Hyperion! That's it.
- The hotel.

359
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,839
- I want to go there.
- Terrific. When would--? Now?

360
00:27:33,849 --> 00:27:35,460
Without an entourage of me?

361
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:38,039
I'll call them.
Josh, car, side door, now.

362
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,160
- Hi. Excuse me.
- Yes? Can we help--?

363
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:11,339
Oh, Miss Chase. How can you help me?
How can I help--? Wait.

364
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,470
How can we help you?

365
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:17,130
I believe my assistant
made a reservation.

366
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:19,930
Ah, the luxury suite.

367
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:23,279
I will take you right up to my room.

368
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,559
Your room, I meant.

369
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,880
Welcome to the Hyperion.

370
00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:36,130
Here we are, Miss Chase.

371
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,950
The luxury suite.

372
00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:44,109
No.

373
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:48,410
This one.

374
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:51,450
I want this one.

375
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:55,359
But that's a....
That's a standard, Miss Chase.

376
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:58,680
- Hardly fitting for someone of your--
- Open it.

377
00:28:59,609 --> 00:29:01,190
Yes, certainly.

378
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,740
- This wallpaper...?
- Ah, yes.

379
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:40,849
Designed by renowned artist
Jacques Latour.

380
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:46,390
Remodeling-- Yes, uh....

381
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:57,400
I hate that wallpaper.
That's bad, bad wallpaper.

382
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,480
171 Oak.

383
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:06,660
Where is that?

384
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,220
Oh, hi.
I'm really sorry to bother you--

385
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:23,140
Oh, my God.
You're Cordelia Chase.

386
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:27,440
- Oh....
- You're.... Cordy.

387
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,250
Yeah, hi.

388
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:34,140
Listen, I know you don't know me,
but would you mind if I...?

389
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,589
- Oh, please, come in.
- Okay, thanks.

390
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:46,710
I'm Cynthia. Cynthia York.

391
00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:52,140
And I love your show.
Like, love-love.

392
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:55,930
You are just-- You are my idol, Cordy.

393
00:30:56,329 --> 00:31:00,049
I want to be just like you,
and have my own design firm, and--

394
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:04,680
Wait a second.
What are you doing in Reseda?

395
00:31:05,329 --> 00:31:09,259
Yeah. Good question.

396
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:16,460
This is gonna sound a little bizarre,
but is everything okay here?

397
00:31:17,329 --> 00:31:20,769
Nothing bad's happened, has it?

398
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:27,190
- My dad left us a couple months ago.
- Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

399
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,779
Is your mom here?

400
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:35,240
- She's up in Ojai, visiting friends.
- Oh.

401
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:40,609
That's....

402
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,339
Well, okay, then.

403
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:43,579
Hey.

404
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,210
You wanna see something cool?

405
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:49,759
Sure.

406
00:31:56,329 --> 00:31:58,500
It's a retrieval spell.

407
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,240
I'm gonna make my dad come back
and live with us again.

408
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,250
I'm pretty sure
I did everything right...

409
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:10,849
...though I spilled Diet Coke on the
book I was using and had to improvise.

410
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:14,109
Pretty cool pentagram, huh?

411
00:32:14,329 --> 00:32:16,009
Cynthia?

412
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,730
I think we should
get out of here before--

413
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,869
- That happens.
- Oh, my God!

414
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,390
Go, Cynthia!
Go on, get out of here. Go!

415
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,329
- Get the girl.
- Let's go.

416
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:47,710
Outside.

417
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,539
What are you doing here,
and what happened to your arm?

418
00:32:53,329 --> 00:32:54,589
Look out.

419
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:15,869
So you, like, kill things now.

420
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,750
Last time I saw you, you just
kind of fainted in front of them.

421
00:33:20,329 --> 00:33:22,359
Cordelia, why on earth are you here?

422
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,569
I know, Reseda.
It's the ninth circle of hell--

423
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:29,630
Not Reseda. In this house.
Is that girl a friend of yours?

424
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:34,109
Look, I know we haven't seen
each other in a while.

425
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,819
But there is something weird
going on with me.

426
00:33:38,329 --> 00:33:39,559
Like, Sunnydale weird.

427
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:43,359
Oh, my God.

428
00:33:44,329 --> 00:33:46,259
My mom is gonna freak.

429
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,680
And underneath
the wallpaper was this address.

430
00:33:56,329 --> 00:33:59,740
So for absolutely no sane-person
reason I can think of...

431
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:03,970
...I come out here, and whammo,
slimy-monster-fun time.

432
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,730
- What's up with that?
- I'm not sure.

433
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:10,889
- I'll have to consult my books.
- Some things never change.

434
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:16,389
Oh, sorry.
This is my partner, Charles Gunn.

435
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,800
Wes said he knew you,
but I didn't believe him.

436
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,190
Yeah, we go way back.

437
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,730
Back to when you had two arms.
Which, by the way....

438
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:30,510
- Kungai demon, couple years ago.
- Is it true you and Wes--?

439
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,929
That you had a little--

440
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:36,829
Humiliating kiss where he drooled
all over my chin?

441
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:41,070
Yeah. But I've worked really hard
to repress it.

442
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:44,590
As much as I enjoy this death march
down memory lane....

443
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,780
What's with you Sunnydale
folks and repression?

444
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:50,320
You three are the most
denying-est folks.

445
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:52,159
Three?

446
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:55,500
Who else is here in L.A.?

447
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:01,269
Cordelia, I want you
to think about this.

448
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,800
Angel's not the person you knew.

449
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:09,559
He came to Los Angeles in pain,
vulnerable.

450
00:35:09,969 --> 00:35:14,469
And when Doyle, his only friend, died,
he retreated into himself.

451
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:18,139
Him getting the visions
didn't help either.

452
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,920
So let me get this straight.

453
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:25,480
Angel gets the visions
of people who are gonna die...

454
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:28,380
...he tells you,
you go out and slay...

455
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,570
...and this is how
you make your living?

456
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,340
This has gotta be the suckiest
job in the world.

457
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:37,980
Pays the bills. Occasionally.

458
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,679
Don't be shocked by his condition.

459
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:45,809
The visions have taken a toll.
And the isolation.

460
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:51,909
Sometimes he sends us out to save
people he killed 200 years ago.

461
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:59,150
- Why not just tell him you said hi?
- Wesley...

462
00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:02,690
...I've gotta see him.

463
00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:18,849
Restraints. Sometimes the visions
make him violent.

464
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:22,409
171 Oak.... 171 Oak Drive.

465
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:26,360
Do you hear me? I feel better.
I can be alone. I won't run away.

466
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:30,280
- Oh, my God.
- This is one of his good days.

467
00:36:30,969 --> 00:36:32,900
No, I won't. I won't do that.

468
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:35,719
I didn't mean--
Only if it's dead.

469
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:38,650
It was me. It was my fault. I'm okay.

470
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:41,650
- I didn't mean, I didn't mean....
- Don't get too close.

471
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:45,000
- I won't run away.
- Angel.

472
00:36:51,969 --> 00:36:55,199
Do you remember me?
Cordelia?

473
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,639
No. I'm afraid.

474
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,780
I'm afraid, I'm afraid.

475
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:06,909
Shh.... Don't be afraid.
I won't hurt you.

476
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,309
I'm fine. I'm fine.

477
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,360
171. 171. You'll see.

478
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:14,409
My head doesn't hurt.

479
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:17,579
My head doesn't hurt now anymore....

480
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:21,000
- You don't remember me.
- I was there, and I wanted to die.

481
00:37:21,969 --> 00:37:25,130
But I was afraid to die.
I was afraid to die.

482
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:28,829
171. 171. 171.

483
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:33,639
- 171.
- Shh....

484
00:37:33,969 --> 00:37:37,590
Angel, it's okay.
Everything is gonna be okay.

485
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:42,420
- There was nothing I could do.
- Everything's gonna be okay.

486
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:02,019
I remember everything.

487
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:04,880
The visions...

488
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:09,039
- ...they're mine.
- We made a deal.

489
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:12,949
You gave up the visions,
and the death that goes with them...

490
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:16,940
...and you get to live out your dream.
It was a fair trade.

491
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:21,559
Sure, it's fair. But it wasn't me.

492
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,699
We've been over this.

493
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,170
I respect what you're trying to do.

494
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:31,480
It's noble and heroic,
and all that Gladiator crap.

495
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,329
- You saw--?
- Didn't love it.

496
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:37,519
Humans are not strong enough
to harbor the visions, period.

497
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:42,170
- Even The Powers can't change that.
- Then find a loophole, Skip.

498
00:38:42,969 --> 00:38:46,480
I know my purpose in this world,
and it includes the visions.

499
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:51,809
And if The Powers That Be aren't
complete dumb-asses, they know it too.

500
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:57,070
There may be a tiny loophole.

501
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:00,849
- I'll take it.
- You may want to think about that.

502
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:05,010
The only way you get to keep the
visions is by becoming part demon.

503
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:12,070
The process isn't easy. It'll make your
vision pain feel like Candyland.

504
00:39:12,969 --> 00:39:17,320
After the agony, the transformation's
effects would be unpredictable.

505
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:21,670
You may never be able to lead
a human life again.

506
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:30,739
So? Demonize me, already.

507
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:36,739
It was an honor being your guide,
Cordelia Chase.

508
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,909
What's happening to her?

509
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,940
- I thought I lost you.
- Oh, Angel.

510
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,719
No horns.

511
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,019
No tail.

512
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,860
Just checking.

513
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:12,679
It feels so good to be solid again.

514
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:19,630
- What's the last thing you remember?
- When? I've been so--

515
00:40:24,449 --> 00:40:28,000
You mean the vision downstairs.
It's been taken care of.

516
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:31,949
There was this actress,
and a one-armed guy....

517
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:35,659
It's a long story, but right now
we have to solve my vision.

518
00:40:36,449 --> 00:40:39,570
- The one you said was taken care of?
- The one I'm having.

519
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:44,829
There's a young man in a park in
Glendale, somewhere near a pond.

520
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,750
There's a demon waiting for him,
he's red...

521
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:52,460
...with four-- No, make it five horns.

522
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:56,969
- Uh.... Cordy?
- What?
