You're... Fred?

8

You look terrible.

Illyria.

10
00:00:52,712 --> 00:00:54,612
- Move.
- Can't.

11
00:00:54,714 --> 00:00:58,980
Can't leave this dimension unless someone
else puts on the necklace, takes my place.

13
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:14,532
<i>I didn't send her.</i>
<i>We were discussing Gunn.</i>

14
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:18,195
I explained his situation,
our inability to get him out.

15
00:01:18,304 --> 00:01:20,772
She nodded, created a portal
and disappeared.

16
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,967
So she's just, what, helping you out?
She's your little helper?

17
00:01:24,076 --> 00:01:27,204
- I would hardly call...
<i>- Well, she sure was helpful beatin'me up.</i>

18
00:01:27,313 --> 00:01:29,975
Wes, do you have any idea why
she's doing all this for you?

19
00:01:30,082 --> 00:01:32,516
Does it matter?
She may be able to get him out.

20
00:01:32,618 --> 00:01:35,143
Or she might get him killed.

21
00:01:35,254 --> 00:01:38,052
<i>It doesn't track, Wes.</i>
<i>Why would she take on any risk for us?</i>

22
00:01:38,157 --> 00:01:41,217
<i>I doubt this poses a risk to her.</i>
<i>She has the power of a god.</i>

23
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:43,022
She has the ego of a god.

24
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:45,723
She was ruler of the world, after all.
Sort of thing goes to one's head.

25
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:49,028
- Apparently.
- I am making progress.

26
00:01:49,135 --> 00:01:53,902
There's distance, of course.
She would never accept any of us as peers.

27
00:01:54,006 --> 00:01:59,376
But I afford her some amusement at the
very least. It may be why she's still here.

28
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:02,845
She's still here because this place reeks
of influence. She had everything, Wes.

29
00:02:02,949 --> 00:02:06,214
<i>Everything. You think she's not</i>
<i>looking to get that back?</i>

30
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,049
I wouldn't presume to know
what she wants.

31
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:11,521
<i>But I understand the resource...</i>

32
00:02:11,624 --> 00:02:14,024
the power she represents.

33
00:02:14,126 --> 00:02:17,892
If we could just find
some way to integrate her.

34
00:02:17,997 --> 00:02:21,262
<i>- To convince her to...</i>
- To do what? Join the team.

35
00:02:23,636 --> 00:02:26,161
- Gunn!
- Illyria.

36
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:32,204
- [Groans]
<i>- This thing.</i>

37
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:35,212
- Let him go.
- It's important to you.

38
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:38,841
- Illyria, stop.
- It holds value. Worth beyond price.

39
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,511
- I said, let him...
- Yes, great worth.

40
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,056
A great debt.
You're talking of the debt, aren't you?

41
00:02:45,157 --> 00:02:47,523
<i>What we owe you.</i>

42
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,857
- [Groans]
- Of what you owe me.

- First day back?
- Yeah.

51
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:47,745
I stabbed you.
I should apologize for that.

52
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:52,978
But I'm honestly not sure how.
I think it'll just be awkward.

53

A compass maybe.

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:27,016
The thing that killed my friend
just saved my life. No one knows why.

00:05:39,165 --> 00:05:42,066
I suppose we have to adjust.

66
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:44,193
I imagine that's what all this is.

67
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:49,263
- Adjustment.
- Adjustment?

68
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:53,209
To things. To myself.

69
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,803
To this place.

70
00:05:55,915 --> 00:05:59,646
To Illyria.

71
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:02,550
She definitely takes adjusting to.

72
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:07,319
You can't look at her without seeing...

73
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:17,968
her body's previous owner.

00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,974
We look so tiny to her.

77
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,244
But you got her on a leash
or something, right?

78
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:38,813
No. [Chuckles] No.

79
00:06:38,924 --> 00:06:43,918
She is monumentally self-possessed.

80
00:06:45,464 --> 00:06:48,695
She still thinks she's
the god-king of the universe.

81
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:50,598
So she's like a TV star.

82
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:53,536
No. Nothing that bad.

83
00:06:54,807 --> 00:06:56,775
A bit more violent though.

84
00:06:58,811 --> 00:07:01,336

All right, Grandma.

85

Uh-huh. Tons.
Loved the bird.

00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:27,365
- Yet you strike at her form without sentiment.
- You ain't her.

90
00:07:27,473 --> 00:07:31,409
I can see it.
Lord knows, I can smell it.

91
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,741
And I got no problem hitting it.

92
00:07:37,816 --> 00:07:40,580
- You are adapting.
- We do that.

93
00:07:40,686 --> 00:07:42,551
Adaptation is compromise.

94
00:07:44,356 --> 00:07:47,519
It's called learning. But then I guess
you know everything there is to know.

95
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:51,926
When the world met me,
it shuddered, groaned.

96
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:53,931
It knelt at my feet.

You have nothing.

101
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,777
Your kind has pulled this domain apart.

102
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:16,321
Each of you has snatched
a tiny piece of it.

103
00:08:16,422 --> 00:08:19,289
Even those with the mightiest
hordes are paupers.

107
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:41,603

113
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,002
Cheeky mix.
A little tae kwon do...

114
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,772
a little Brazilian ninjitsu,
ancestrally speaking.

115
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:17,815
- We have to stop these sessions.
- Hang on. Just now gettin' into it.

116
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,248
Testing her has sharpened technique
I didn't even know was rusty.

117
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:23,981
We're not testing her, Spike.
She's testing us.

<i>- [Panting]</i>
<i>- [Spike] Got her winded at least, didn't I?</i>

Got to start sometime.
That's what I keep telling myself anyway.

123
00:10:00,993 --> 00:10:03,689
So you good?
I mean, you look good, considering.

124
00:10:06,432 --> 00:10:09,230
I just thought I'd, uh, drop in to...

125
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:11,359

126
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,461

Good.

128
00:10:15,808 --> 00:10:17,742
Oh, I'm about to go on assignment.

129
00:10:17,843 --> 00:10:21,244
Angel wants me to start tailing Illyria,

133
00:10:34,026 --> 00:10:39,054
Strange times.
Have you talked to Wes?

134
00:10:39,164 --> 00:10:43,567
Well, we've exchanged words.
I wouldn't exactly call it talking.

135
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:46,536
He's still reeling since
Our Lady of the Blue Bummer arrived.

136
00:10:46,638 --> 00:10:50,005
- Yeah, I was just in his office, and he was...
- Oh, God, don't go in there!

137
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:53,600
- That's where he keeps his full-strength crazy.
- Yeah, caught a whiff of that.

138
00:10:53,712 --> 00:10:56,875
L-It's like he's two different people.
One is almost catatonic.

139
00:10:56,982 --> 00:10:59,780
He's the guy you see doing
the impatient shuffle around the hallways.

140
00:10:59,885 --> 00:11:02,786
And the other is just
cooped up in there all day...

141
00:11:02,888 --> 00:11:04,788
jittering like
a bug on a hot plate...

142
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,552
obsessing over every single tidbit
he can find on Illyria.

143
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:11,561
- What's Angel say about it?
- Oh, he's not very talky these days either.

Uh, 10-4, good buddy.

00:11:23,842 --> 00:11:28,370
Okay. Upshot is you don't like Babe the Blue
Ox, in your house and you want to get rid of her.

148
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,313
- Yeah.
- So? Are we talking pasture...

149
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,748
or slaughterhouse?

150
00:11:35,287 --> 00:11:38,188
She didn't have a problem
with killing Fred, did she?

151
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:44,058
Illyria infected Fred with no
more malice than a viral phage.

152
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,153
<i>Hey, look, Wes, I know you're</i>
<i>bonding with her, but...</i>

153

But she's unpredictable, dangerous, too
powerful a being, too close to being an enemy.

154
00:11:51,036 --> 00:11:53,504
Yes, Angel, it's self-evident.

155
00:11:53,605 --> 00:11:55,505
Which means we have to
find some kind of weakness.

156
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:59,168
<i>- Some point of vulnerability.</i>
<i>- You want me to find a way to kill her.</i>

- You got a problem with that?
- No.

158
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,075
Good. Because we got more than
enough problems to worry about.

159
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,177
Yeah. For example,
what about the apocalypse?

160
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:13,486
Still trying to get my head around that one.
Lindsey said we're in the middle of it?

161
00:12:13,592 --> 00:12:17,323
Oh, yes, the thousand-year war of
good versus evil is well underway.

162
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:20,865
<i>Evil just hasn't told anyone about it yet,</i>
<i>which is probably why they're winning.</i>

163
00:12:20,966 --> 00:12:23,764
Oh, by the way,
we're apparently on the wrong side.

164
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:26,099
Or the right side,
if you like winning.

165
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:29,469
- Sounds like you guys are buying it.
- Next time you go out there...

166
00:12:29,575 --> 00:12:33,341
take a good look around,
'cause it's true, Gunn.

167
00:12:34,913 --> 00:12:37,507
Works for me.
So what's that mean for us?

168
00:12:37,616 --> 00:12:41,609
Tell us how we fight an invisible war.
I don't even know who we're fighting.

169
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:45,046
All the evil we've stopped so far...

170
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:48,957
- and we're still the partners' number-one earner.
<i>- [Hamilton] Not anymore.</i>

171
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,495
<i>Let me ask you something, Angel.</i>

172
00:12:51,597 --> 00:12:54,964
You ever heard the term
"surgical strike?"

173
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,035
Ever heard of the term "appointment?"

174
00:12:57,135 --> 00:13:00,366
Illyria destroyed 11 torture units
before she found your man...

175
00:13:00,472 --> 00:13:02,997
<i>two troop carriers,</i>
<i>an ice cream truck...</i>

176
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:05,668
and eight beautifully
maintained lawns.

177
00:13:05,777 --> 00:13:09,076
<i>Not to mention dozens of employees</i>
<i>rendered useless to the company.</i>

178
00:13:09,181 --> 00:13:11,547
- Bill me.
- Oh, we will.

179
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:14,380
The damages are coming
directly out of this division's profits.

180
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:17,353
Congratulations.
In one swift stroke...

181
00:13:17,456 --> 00:13:21,187
you've gone from leader
of the pack to staggering at the rear.

182
00:13:21,293 --> 00:13:23,557
- And?
<i>- Angel...</i>

183
00:13:23,662 --> 00:13:27,189
you're a motivated go-getter
at the top of the corporate ladder.

184
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:29,199
Why don't you figure out
what comes after "and."

185
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:31,895
- We're workin' on that.
- Yes, I'm sure you are.

186
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:35,906
In the meantime, the partners have
a small task they'd like you to oversee.

187
00:13:36,008 --> 00:13:40,069
I'm sending Gunn the file.
It's good to see you again, by the way.

188
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:43,739
<i>It's a simple matter,</i>
<i>but with some very big players.</i>

189
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:46,409
If this is our chance to get into
a better grace with the head office...

190
00:13:46,518 --> 00:13:48,418
I'd have to say it's not my priority.

191
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,251
Oh, no, don't think about us, Angel.
Think about profits.

192
00:13:52,357 --> 00:13:56,885
It's profits that let you keep this plucky
little boatload of good above water.

193
00:13:56,995 --> 00:13:59,589
It's business, boys,
not a bat cave.

194
00:13:59,698 --> 00:14:01,598
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

195
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,568
Well, I'll tell you what.
I still like him better than Eve.

196
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,875
This day.

197
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:17,779
What name is it given
in your cycle of days?

198
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:19,851
I give it...

199
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,920
Monday.

200
00:14:24,022 --> 00:14:25,990
This conversation.

201
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:32,361
- We've had it before.
- Well, yes.

202
00:14:32,464 --> 00:14:37,424
We've discussed our system
of temporal measurement...

203
00:14:37,536 --> 00:14:43,338
and our technology, weights and measures,
local customs, world history...

204
00:14:43,442 --> 00:14:47,640
- You're my guide.
- Apparently.

205
00:14:47,746 --> 00:14:51,204
You're more than that.

206
00:14:51,316 --> 00:14:53,409
Really?

207
00:14:55,887 --> 00:14:58,913
You're my betrayer.

208
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:01,959
When you shattered the Window of Orlon,
you meant to change the past.

209
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:07,555
To rewrite your history
and the history of this body.

210
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,999
And instead, I brought back
more painful memories.

211
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:14,104
It was a failure.

212
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:16,970
I've come to understand how irreversible
the works of time are.

213
00:15:17,075 --> 00:15:19,839
- But you intended to alter them.
- I wanted to bring back Fred.

214
00:15:19,945 --> 00:15:23,005
- And destroy me.
- As an unavoidable consequence.

215
00:15:26,585 --> 00:15:28,883
Does it sting you?

216
00:15:28,987 --> 00:15:30,955
<i>My betrayal?</i>

217
00:15:32,824 --> 00:15:34,951
Betrayal was a neutral word in my day.

218
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,928
As unjudged a word
as "water" or "breeze."

219
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,999
No.

220
00:15:44,436 --> 00:15:47,030
Or perhaps...

221
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:50,506
I am only bothered
because I am bothered.

222
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:57,406
That sounds very close to human.

223
00:15:57,516 --> 00:15:59,507
Motes of dust.

224
00:15:59,618 --> 00:16:03,520
Mayflies who die so soon after they're born
they might as well not live at all.

225
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:06,682
Now, now. Manners.

226
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:10,353
Just got the file from Hamilton.
Skimming it now.

227
00:16:10,462 --> 00:16:12,760
Looks like some sort
of ceremonial demon pact.

228
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:16,027
- You have to sign as witness for the firm.
- You've met Hamilton.

229
00:16:16,134 --> 00:16:20,594
- Sorry?
- The new liaison. You met him before today?

230
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:22,673
Yeah.

231
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:26,710
Came down to my basement for a visit while
I was getting carved. Offered to get me out.

232
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:29,246
And what'd you say?

233
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:31,679
You really have to ask me that?

234
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,876
I really do.

235
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:39,013
I turned him down.
Not into making deals. Not anymore.

236
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,615
Well, that's gonna make it
tough to be a lawyer.

237
00:16:41,726 --> 00:16:43,626
It was tough already.

238
00:16:43,728 --> 00:16:46,891
Making business go smoothly
for a bunch of hideous, scaly, evil clients.

239
00:16:46,998 --> 00:16:49,558
<i>Excuse me.</i>

240
00:16:49,668 --> 00:16:51,795
I'm here about the demon pact.

241
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:56,405
They found me. They said that
they had these seer people...

242
00:16:56,508 --> 00:17:00,239
who told them that my baby
was some kind of holy one.

243
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:02,313
They said it was a prophecy.

244
00:17:02,414 --> 00:17:03,415
<i>How much do you know</i>
<i>about the Fell Brethren?</i>

245
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:04,541
<i>How much do you know</i>
<i>about the Fell Brethren?</i>

246
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,913
Well, they're really religious.

247
00:17:07,018 --> 00:17:10,749
I mean, their religion,
not the God one.

248
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:13,290
<i>But they've been really supportive.</i>

249
00:17:13,391 --> 00:17:16,724
They're always bringing me
special shakes and vitamins.

250
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:21,060
- You realize they're demons.
- Uh-huh. They're very open about it.

251
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,794
<i>Well, any demonic pact</i>
<i>should be entered into with caution.</i>

252
00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:26,700
Uh, they can be riddled with
obscure clauses and double-talk.

253
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:29,330
- As our client, we have to advise you to...
<i>- She's not your client.</i>

254
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:33,010
We are.

255
00:17:41,286 --> 00:17:44,187
Odd.

256
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:47,315
It doesn't exist until it cracks apart.

257
00:17:47,425 --> 00:17:49,188
What's that?

258
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:52,797
Time.

259
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,459
You don't look altogether well.

260
00:17:59,804 --> 00:18:02,534
Your opinion of me
weighs less than sunlight.

261
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:07,807

Illyria?

266
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,476
You tried to murder me.

267
00:18:46,618 --> 00:18:50,019
- Again.
- What? I haven't.

268
00:18:50,121 --> 00:18:53,249
I don't want you dead, believe me.

269
00:18:53,358 --> 00:18:57,192
I was there. I saw it.

270
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,598

anything to drink?

274
00:19:19,217 --> 00:19:23,415
Coffee? Tea?
Got blood.

What's he doing in there
with the Holy Vessel?

276
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,716
And a variety of organic colas.

277
00:19:27,826 --> 00:19:31,262
The Brethren have a delicate
relationship with the vessel.

278
00:19:31,363 --> 00:19:34,423
If she's presenting any problems,
we should be the ones to...

279
00:19:34,532 --> 00:19:39,026
Believe me, Angel will take care
of everything. That's what he does.

280
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:43,631
Yep. I'm sure he's in there,
you know, getting into her head.

But, uh...

Well, the partners know her, Wesley.

348
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:14,537
Yes, they go way back.

488
00:33:12,216 --> 00:33:14,946
<i>All that matters is victory.</i>

489
00:33:15,052 --> 00:33:17,020
That's how your reign persists.

490
00:33:20,257 --> 00:33:23,624
You're a slave to an insane construct.

491
00:33:25,896 --> 00:33:28,057
You are moral.

492
00:33:28,165 --> 00:33:32,568
[Scoffs]
A true ruler is as moral as a hurricane.

493
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:37,004
Empty but for the force of his gale.

494
00:33:40,878 --> 00:33:43,506
But you...
[Panting]

495
00:33:43,614 --> 00:33:46,879
<i>Trapped in the web of the wolf,</i>
<i>the ram, the hart.</i>

496
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:50,078
So much power here.

497
00:33:50,187 --> 00:33:52,747
And you quibble at its price.

498
00:33:55,526 --> 00:34:00,828
If you want to win a war, you must
serve no master but your ambition.

499
00:34:01,866 --> 00:34:05,302
[Groaning]

500
00:34:05,402 --> 00:34:07,996
You have not lied.

501
00:34:08,105 --> 00:34:12,064
<i>My undoing is beyond you, your people.</i>

502
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:14,144
Something is broken inside me.

503
00:34:14,245 --> 00:34:17,578
[Groans]
My power is too great.

504
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:23,483
I know this now, as I know it
every time I come to this moment.

505
00:34:23,587 --> 00:34:27,421
Illyria, if I am here, if I am paradox,
then this can all change, can't it?

506
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:30,652
<i>You said things have been altered. What you</i>
<i>said, did. You can change this outcome.</i>

507
00:34:30,761 --> 00:34:33,628
Change is constant.

508
00:34:33,731 --> 00:34:35,926
Yet things remain the same.

509
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,470
<i>[Spike] So what sort of damage are</i>
<i>we lookin'at if Illyria Chernobyls on us?</i>

510
00:34:45,576 --> 00:34:49,774
- Conservative guess, several city blocks.
- Wes, you're alive.

511
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,110
Illyria, she's self-destructing.
She's a time bomb.

512
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:54,116
- Read today's paper, did you?
- What?

513
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:56,118
You've been yappin' about bloody nothin'
but that for the last 10 minutes.

514
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,915
No, no. I just left a meeting with Illyria.

515
00:34:58,022 --> 00:35:00,115
<i>She grabbed me and we phased through</i>
<i>time. I don't think she meant to do it.</i>

516
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:03,352
- Look, she's overloading. She's gonna explode.
<i>- [Wes] Yes, we know.</i>

517
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,054
Angel, we've been over all this.

518
00:35:06,163 --> 00:35:08,358
Do you even know
how to use this thing?

519
00:35:08,465 --> 00:35:11,730
She's come unstuck in time, Wes.
She knows what happens. She's seen it.

520
00:35:11,835 --> 00:35:13,894
She-She knows we want to kill her.

521
00:35:14,004 --> 00:35:15,869
Yes, she said that to me as well.

522
00:35:17,308 --> 00:35:20,869
Oh, guys, this isn't good.

523
00:35:20,978 --> 00:35:24,072
- That's funny. I didn't even see her leave.
- Well, that's the problem.

524
00:35:24,181 --> 00:35:26,741
"Slew the white-haired one first."

525
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:30,183
- Don't always see her when she's bugger...
- [Yells]

526
00:35:33,524 --> 00:35:36,288
[Groans]
Wait. Wait!

527
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:40,889
Illyria, wait, please.

528
00:35:40,998 --> 00:35:43,193
Wes, put that thing down.
Spike, nobody move.

529
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:48,337
This too. All changing.
[Groans]

530
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:50,407
I know what happens.
I know you kill us all.

531
00:35:50,507 --> 00:35:52,168
Oh, a bit pessimistic, aren't you?

532
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,176
And then you shudder
and you convulse with pain...

533
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:56,872
- and then the power inside you explodes.
<i>- You are the Angel from the past.</i>

534
00:35:56,981 --> 00:35:59,381
You were swept up in my wake.

535
00:35:59,483 --> 00:36:02,577
You're not a king anymore.
Your domain is gone, swallowed by time.

536
00:36:02,686 --> 00:36:05,849
- We've had this conversation.
- You explode. I was there.

537
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:07,856
It was powerful enough
to blow me back through time.

538
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,789
<i>I have no idea what</i>
<i>it does to the building.</i>

539
00:36:09,893 --> 00:36:12,123
More like the continental shelf, actually.

540
00:36:12,229 --> 00:36:15,687
I have to stop that. Do you understand?
I cannot have your death blow away my...

541
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:19,291
- Your kingdom?
- Yeah, sure. Whatever.

542
00:36:21,939 --> 00:36:26,273
- You ask me to allow you to murder me.
- It's not murder if you say yes.

543
00:36:26,377 --> 00:36:29,574
<i>No one is murdering you.</i>
<i>This device won't kill you.</i>

544
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,878
- What? You said...
- I lied.

545
00:36:36,453 --> 00:36:39,320
Illyria, this device will draw
the energy away from you safely.

546
00:36:39,423 --> 00:36:43,826
- It will allow you to live.
- Your intent is not murder?

547
00:36:43,927 --> 00:36:47,260
- It never was.
- Well, no harm, no foul.

548
00:36:47,364 --> 00:36:50,424
But you tried to destroy me.
To bring back Fred.

549
00:36:50,534 --> 00:36:55,062
That didn't work.
It was a failure.

550
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:59,905
<i>- But now I know you're all that's left.</i>
<i>- You want to take my power...</i>

551
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,604
to let me live.

552
00:37:02,713 --> 00:37:04,874
But I am my power.

553
00:37:04,982 --> 00:37:08,281
And I would rather be a titanic crater
than to be like unto you.

554
00:37:13,557 --> 00:37:17,323
I kill you.
That's how this ends.

555
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:21,327
Gettin' ahead of ourselves a bit.

556
00:37:33,577 --> 00:37:37,138
Illyria, the future can change here.
You can choose a different path.

557
00:37:37,247 --> 00:37:40,273
- And be nothing.
- And be what you are.

558
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:45,822
- [Groans]
- Fighting to hold on to what you were,
it's destroying you.

559
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:50,291
You would do this to me?

560
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:53,955
I'd try, anyway.
Every time.

561
00:37:57,201 --> 00:37:59,169
I possess so much grace.

562
00:37:59,269 --> 00:38:04,332
More grace than this
bag of sticks could express.

563
00:38:04,441 --> 00:38:06,739
I was the immaculate
embodiment of rule.

564
00:38:10,214 --> 00:38:12,648
I blame this on the weakness
of your species.

565
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,546
Fair enough.

566
00:38:27,998 --> 00:38:30,694
Illyria?

567
00:38:30,801 --> 00:38:34,100
Touch me and die, vermin.

568
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:37,330
Not a very dramatic difference, really.

569
00:38:40,344 --> 00:38:42,335
Everything is different.

570
00:38:50,554 --> 00:38:53,717
So what's the prognosis?

571
00:38:53,824 --> 00:38:56,793
She won't be stopping time...

572
00:38:56,894 --> 00:38:59,920
or walking through dimensions.

573
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:04,160
And I suspect her physical strength
has decreased somewhat.

574
00:39:04,268 --> 00:39:06,395
That's what I wanted to hear.

575
00:39:09,573 --> 00:39:11,541
You're gonna stay with her,
aren't you?

576
00:39:15,779 --> 00:39:18,646
Yes.

577
00:39:18,749 --> 00:39:21,217
[Sighs]
Wes...

578
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:24,549
I don't like where this is going.

579
00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:28,057
I don't like where this has been.

580
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:33,053
I'm not in love
with this thing, Angel.

581
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:38,123
But for some reason,
I need it right now.

582
00:39:38,235 --> 00:39:41,727
Yeah. That's just weird.

583
00:39:46,376 --> 00:39:49,004
I know.

584
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:54,644
She could still prove
to be problematic for us.

585
00:39:54,751 --> 00:39:57,117
Much of what she was is still intact.

586
00:39:57,221 --> 00:40:01,681
I doubt she'll ever stop
trying to conquer...

587
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,760
everything.

588
00:40:06,396 --> 00:40:08,660
"Serve no master
but your ambition."

589
00:40:08,765 --> 00:40:13,327
- What's that?
- I think you may have been right before.

590
00:40:13,437 --> 00:40:16,668
About Illyria being a resource.

591
00:40:18,108 --> 00:40:20,201
She just might make the team yet.

592
00:40:25,249 --> 00:40:27,843
<i>[Fell Demon] We've sought this child for</i>
<i>decades. We're not letting go of it now.!</i>

593
00:40:27,951 --> 00:40:30,385
<i>[Gunn] Only the mother's consent</i>
<i>will sanctify this transaction.</i>

594
00:40:30,487 --> 00:40:32,182
<i>- That's exactly what we have.</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah? Show it to me.</i>

595
00:40:32,289 --> 00:40:34,849
It's an agreement in principle.
The child is ours.

596
00:40:34,958 --> 00:40:36,858
I can tear that apart in a courtroom.
Just watch me.

597
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,861
- But we're paying you.
- We're not taking your money!

598
00:40:39,963 --> 00:40:41,863
I understand, Your Holiness, fully.

599
00:40:41,965 --> 00:40:44,525
If this gets fouled here
by that lunatic...

600
00:40:44,635 --> 00:40:46,694
<i>our hordes will fall on this place.</i>

601
00:40:46,803 --> 00:40:49,829
<i>There won't be so much</i>
<i>as an eyetooth left of any of them.!</i>

602
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,239
Yes, well, that would be more
Angel's business than mine.

603
00:40:53,343 --> 00:40:55,311
<i>[Fell Demon] She won't make it</i>
<i>through another day.</i>

604
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:59,678
- You think we can't protect her?
- The Fell are everywhere.
We are a force of nature.

605
00:40:59,783 --> 00:41:02,377
Gunn, the baby belongs to the Fell.

606
00:41:02,486 --> 00:41:05,887
What? She hasn't signed anything.
There's nothing on paper.

607
00:41:08,659 --> 00:41:10,854
Gentlemen.

608
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:17,097
Angel.

609
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,327
What are you doin'?

610
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:21,870
What we're supposed to.

611
00:41:23,507 --> 00:41:25,475
Serve our clients.

612
00:42:06,249 --> 00:42:08,649
Grr! Arrgh!
