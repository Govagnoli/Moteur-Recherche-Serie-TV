00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:25,048
<i>[Wesley]</i>
<i>She's either counting oxygen molecules...</i>

2
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:28,279
or analyzing the petri dish
she just put into her mouth.

3
00:00:28,387 --> 00:00:30,787
<i>Or sleeping.</i>
<i>I can never quite tell.</i>

4
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,758
- You sure this is a good idea?
- We have plenty of petri dishes.

5
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:36,385
- I meant...
- I know what you meant.

6
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:40,556
- You don't have to do this all yourself.
- Who else is there?

7
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,896
We're running out of people.
We're getting no further with Gunn...

8
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:46,165
I'm not leaving Gunn in a hell dimension.
We'll get him out.

9
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:51,538
<i>In the meantime, I need you</i>
<i>to let us help you with her.</i>

10
00:00:51,644 --> 00:00:53,839
<i>- She's my responsibility.</i>
- She's our responsibility.

11
00:00:53,946 --> 00:00:56,574
If she's gonna be here, there are things
that we should be doing.

12
00:00:56,682 --> 00:01:00,083
Testing her powers, studying her.

13
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:03,951
She put a whole petri dish
in her mouth?

14
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:06,650
<i>[Wesley]</i>
<i>Illyria can be...</i>

15
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:09,626
<i>diffiicult.</i>

16
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:13,130
Testing her might be hard without
getting someone seriously hurt.

17
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:16,997
- We'll make Spike do it.
- Good.

18
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:24,073
She doesn't understand
our world.

19
00:01:26,679 --> 00:01:29,614
She needs someone to guide her.
She needs...

20
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,444
When was the last time
you slept?

21
00:01:33,753 --> 00:01:35,812
You're not her savior.

22
00:01:35,922 --> 00:01:41,189
I need you here, working, not off drinking
yourself into a coma, chasing ghosts.

23
00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:46,021
Fred's dead, Wes.
You're still alive.

24
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:49,635
Start acting like it.

25
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:01,947
We didn't know where else to go.

26
00:02:02,048 --> 00:02:04,812
Our son was
getting the mail.

27
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:06,908
We could see him
from the living room.

28
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:10,420
He was walking across the driveway,
and this van...

29
00:02:10,523 --> 00:02:13,924
It must've been goin' 50,
60 miles an hour.

30
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:17,291
It hopped the curb,
and it ran right into him.

31
00:02:17,396 --> 00:02:19,296
<i>It slammed him right into</i>
<i>the side of the garage...</i>

32
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:22,890
<i>and then...</i>
<i>backed up and sped off.</i>

33
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,937
And the police think
this was intentional.

34
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,599
- Has Homicide found the van?
- You don't understand.

35
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:31,336
Our son's not dead.

36
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,712
- He's not?
<i>- [Man] No.</i>

37
00:02:34,814 --> 00:02:39,183
- He's fine. The van hit him, and he got right up.
- He hardly has a scratch on him.

38
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:42,277
<i>Police said it was dumb luck.</i>
<i>But if you saw it...</i>

39
00:02:42,388 --> 00:02:46,347
One of the officers called us later,
said our son might be different.

40
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:51,590
<i>He mentioned that there was a law firm in</i>
<i>Los Angeles that dealt with... things like this.</i>

41
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:54,359
Harmony, would you ask Angel
to come in here, please?

42
00:02:57,236 --> 00:02:59,932
Our son's downstairs. He thinks
that we're here to set up a trust.

43
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,599
We didn't know
what else to tell him.

44
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:07,941
- Please, will you help us?
- Of course.

45
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:13,485
<i>[Connor]</i>
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

46
00:04:18,451 --> 00:04:20,351
What...

47
00:04:20,453 --> 00:04:23,013
- What are you...
- Dad?

48
00:04:23,122 --> 00:04:24,817
<i>Yeah, it's okay.</i>
<i>Come on over.</i>

49
00:04:28,828 --> 00:04:31,558
You know, they have dried scorpions
in the vending machines downstairs.

50
00:04:31,664 --> 00:04:34,599
Angel, good. This is Laurence
and Colleen Reilly...

51
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,634
- and this is their son...
- Connor. Hi.

52
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,203
- Nice to meet you.
<i>- The Reillys need to talk about some issues...</i>

53
00:04:39,305 --> 00:04:41,796
<i>- regarding Connor here,</i>
<i>and I thought we could...</i>
- No.

54
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,898
- What?
- I'm sorry.

55
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:48,207
There must be some mistake.
We can't help you.

56
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:57,080
A van ran him down.
He got up and walked away... unharmed.

57
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:00,420
- How did they find us?
<i>- Apolice offiicer mentioned our name.</i>

58
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:03,017
Said we might
be able to help.

59
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:08,799
- We're not taking this case.
- Why not?

60
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:10,892
Because with everything
goin' on, we don't have time...

61
00:05:11,003 --> 00:05:12,971
to be dealing with
small stuff like this.

62
00:05:13,072 --> 00:05:16,906
"Small stuff'? This is what we do.
Or what we're supposed to do.

63
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:20,001
They need help.
They seem like good people.

64
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,205
All the more reason
to get 'em out of here.

65
00:05:22,314 --> 00:05:24,373
We know what this place
does to good people.

66
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,744
[Screams]

67
00:06:00,352 --> 00:06:03,082
What was it?

68
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:06,989
What am l...
I was lookin' for somethin'.

69
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:14,929
[Loudly]
It's okay.

70
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:17,002
Found it.

<i>- [Punch Lands]</i>
- [Groans]

72
00:06:24,577 --> 00:06:27,171
You break so easily.

73
00:06:28,614 --> 00:06:31,242
Why do you bother
getting back up?

74
00:06:32,384 --> 00:06:35,717
Right. We need to set
some ground rules.

75
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:38,016
First off, no more
punching me in the face.

76
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:40,921
Secondly, when I
punch you in the face...

77
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,823
you tell me how you feel...

78
00:06:42,928 --> 00:06:45,192
so I can write that down
on my clipboard.

79
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:49,361
Third, no touchin'
my clipboard. Fourth...

80
00:06:49,468 --> 00:06:52,869
- I enjoy hurting you.
- We're gonna have to fix that, 'cause I'm...

<i>- I've been hitting the half-breed.</i>

83
00:07:08,621 --> 00:07:10,350
He makes noise.

84
00:07:11,757 --> 00:07:13,884
We're off to a bit
of a rough start.

85
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:16,188
But don't worry.
I'll break her.

86
00:07:16,295 --> 00:07:18,729
She's not a horse, Spike.

87
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:22,858
<i>You know, this room is equipped</i>
<i>with automated training devices.</i>

88
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:26,734
<i>You don't have to test her</i>
<i>byjust allowing her to pummel you.</i>

89
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:30,172
We're workin' on the basics.
But don't worry. I'm writing it all down.

90
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:32,642
Okay, fine.

91
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:36,704
You reek of frustration.
Curls off of you like smoke.

92
00:07:36,815 --> 00:07:38,942
Actually, luv, we call that scotch.

93
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:41,019

<i>Good choice.</i>

00:07:43,322 --> 00:07:45,222
It's nothing.
I'm just, uh...

96
00:07:45,324 --> 00:07:48,487
I had a slight disagreement
with Angel.

97
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:51,256
<i>Oh, old broody pants</i>
<i>got you wound up, eh?</i>

98
00:07:51,363 --> 00:07:54,696
<i>Keep in mind he can't get laid</i>
<i>without maybe goin'crazy.</i>

99
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,700
- It makes it funny.
- In my time...

100
00:07:56,802 --> 00:07:58,702
a leader would punish
your insolence with death.

101
00:07:58,804 --> 00:08:01,773
- We're not being insolent, Illyria.
- I am.

102
00:08:01,874 --> 00:08:07,403
It's just, uh, I don't
always understand Angel.

103
00:08:07,513 --> 00:08:09,413
Yet you
follow him willingly.

104
00:08:09,515 --> 00:08:14,214
- You're loyal to him.
- He's earned it.

105
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,189
<i>- I trust he knows what he's doing.</i>
<i>- [Door Opens]</i>

106
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:24,024
- What the hell is goin' on?
- Angel? I'm at your disposal.

107
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,721
My son walks in
through my door!

108
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:28,061
And you make him walk right out again.
I found that interesting.

109
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,431
I want him as far away
from here as possible.

110
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:34,131
Yes. It might have been smart to
get some information out of him first.

111
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:36,639
- It could help us understand what's happening.
<i>- I'll tell you what.</i>

112
00:08:36,742 --> 00:08:38,710
Why don't you just tell me?

113
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:40,836
Let's be clear about this.

114
00:08:40,946 --> 00:08:42,914
Things run differently now.

115
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:45,210
I'm not a little girl,
and you and I...

116
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,285
won't be making love
on this couch anytime soon.

117
00:08:48,687 --> 00:08:51,315
And with that in mind,
how can I help you?

118
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,429
The senior partners
and I had a deal.

119
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:01,726
<i>Yes, you did.</i>
<i>They took your son...</i>

120
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:04,268
your raging,
psychopathic son...

121
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,565
gave him a new family,
changed his memories...

122
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,799
changed everyone's memories,
actually...

123
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:11,740
<i>in order to give him a new life,</i>
<i>a normal life.</i>

124
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:14,312
- And I came to work here.
<i>- And we couldn't be happier.</i>

125
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:16,847
The senior partners
honor their deals.

126
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:19,509
<i>And believe me,</i>
<i>they have no desire to upset...</i>

127
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:23,145
<i>such a profitable partnership.</i>

128
00:09:24,423 --> 00:09:29,554
So this is just a...
an unfortunate coincidence.

129
00:09:29,661 --> 00:09:32,095
<i>Oh, no, I didn't say that.</i>
<i>I said the senior partners...</i>

130
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,097
weren't behind it.

131
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,531
This isn't an accident.

132
00:09:36,635 --> 00:09:39,798
Someone out there's
trying to send you a message...

133
00:09:39,905 --> 00:09:41,805
and they're using
your son to do it.

134
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:50,976
Where are we
supposed to go now?

135
00:09:52,818 --> 00:09:57,312
I'm sure there's someone else
who can, uh, handle our trust.

136
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:04,719
Um, just so you know, you guys
don't have to keep pretending.

137
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,231
- I know we were there because of the van thing.
- Oh.

138
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:11,302
- I'm sorry, honey. It's just... It was...
- It's cool.

139
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:15,965
My parents are liars, and I can never
trust them again, but it's cool.

140
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,406
Look, I know
you guys are worried...

141
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,276
but the whole point
is I'm okay.

142
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:24,212
I got hit, and I'm okay.
That should make you happy...

143
00:10:24,316 --> 00:10:27,308
not like, you know,
mental patients.

144
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:31,185
I mean, it turned out fine.

145
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,485
[Mr. Reilly]
It's the getting-hit part.

146
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,492
We thought you were dead.

147
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,791
- [Connor] Hey, have some faith in me.
- Connor...

148
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:42,560
<i>[Connor]</i>
<i>All right. Look, you guys.</i>

149
00:10:42,668 --> 00:10:45,603
I'm not saying
this isn't weird and all.

150
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:48,935
But we'll get through it.
You don't have to be scared.

151
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,703

- Oh, my God!
- Connor, listen to me.

159
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,824
You almost broke
that guy in half.

160
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:52,994
That was awesome!

161
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,834
Seriously, that was the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

162
00:12:00,946 --> 00:12:03,312
Well, it's not a big deal.

163
00:12:03,415 --> 00:12:05,474
I mean, I do stuff like that a lot.

164
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:08,610
- There was this one time in France...
<i>- [Mrs. Reilly] Connor.!</i>

165
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,417
Dad. Dad.

166
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,357
- I'm okay.
- We need to get him to a hospital.

167
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,428
<i>We got doctors at Wolfram and Hart.</i>
<i>We can help.</i>

168
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,692
And you and I have some things
we should probably talk about.

169
00:12:22,134 --> 00:12:24,602
Yeah, I kind of figured.

170
00:12:27,072 --> 00:12:29,540
Your dad's gonna be fine.
He's in good hands.

171
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:33,737
Or claws, as the case may be.
They're good doctors.

172
00:12:33,845 --> 00:12:35,779
What were those things
that attacked us?

173
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:38,543
Some kind of demon.
We're lookin' into it.

174
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,084
Is that what I am?
Some kind of demon?

175
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:47,286
- No.
- Then what am I?

176
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:52,420
The best we can tell, you're a healthy,
well-adjusted kid...

177
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:55,796
with, uh,
enhanced abilities.

178
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:58,131
And you're a vampire.

179
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:04,606
So, demons, vampires,
doctors with claws...

180
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:08,476
and I'm some sort
of superhero.

181
00:13:09,815 --> 00:13:11,783
Okay.

182
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,920
You're taking this
pretty well.

183
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:19,149
What am I supposed to do,
complain?

184
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,418
I just don't know how
I'm gonna explain it to my parents.

185
00:13:21,526 --> 00:13:23,960
You got family?

186
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:26,030
- No.
- Right. Vampire.

187
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:28,725
So, what are you,
like, 500 years old?

188
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:31,928
No, I'm, uh...
Do I look 500?

189
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:34,597
Do you spend all your time
making out with other vampires...

190
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:36,606
like in Anne Rice novels?

191
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:40,872
No. Well, I used to, but...

192
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:43,539
- You have a girlfriend at least?
- I can't afford to.

193
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:46,117
- Must be lonely.
- I keep busy.

194
00:13:46,218 --> 00:13:49,813
<i>Right. So, you guys,</i>
<i>like, fight crime...</i>

195
00:13:49,921 --> 00:13:51,889
and save the world here,
that sort of stuff?

196
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,584
- Well, that's the idea.
- Wow.

197
00:13:54,693 --> 00:13:57,389
Is everyone here a superhero?
This place must be insane.

198
00:13:57,496 --> 00:14:00,192
It's mostly paralegals and secretaries.
Pretty boring, really.

199
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,396
You filthy harlot!

200
00:14:06,505 --> 00:14:08,803
I'm gonna tear your neck out!

201
00:14:12,411 --> 00:14:14,971
- You wanna meet some of my coworkers?
<i>- [Blows Landing]</i>

202
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,048
Okay.

203
00:14:19,851 --> 00:14:22,820
[Grunting]

204
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,324
Guys, you wanna come here
for a second?

205
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,894
- What is she?
- She's a... um, a...

206
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,897
Well, to be honest,
I really don't know.

207
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,832
- She's some sort of ancient demon.
- She have any powers?

208
00:14:36,935 --> 00:14:38,903
Glad you asked.

209
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:41,802
So far, I've established
that she can hit like a Mack truck...

210
00:14:41,907 --> 00:14:43,898
selectively alter the flow of time...

211
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:47,342
<i>and, uh, possibly</i>
<i>talk to plants.</i>

212
00:14:47,446 --> 00:14:49,471
I'd like to keep Spike
as my pet.

213
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,116
Connor, this is Spike
and Illyria.

214
00:14:53,218 --> 00:14:55,652
- Guys, this is Connor.
- Hi.

215
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,415
Um, I like your outfit.

216
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,122
Your body warms.

217
00:15:04,229 --> 00:15:06,129
This one is
lusting after me.

218
00:15:07,232 --> 00:15:09,928
Oh, no. L...

219
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:14,438
<i>It's... It's just, uh...</i>
<i>It's the outfit.</i>

220
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,530
I guess I've always had
a thing for older women.

221
00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:18,268
- They were supposed to fix that.
- What?

222
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,469
Nothing. Connor has
brought us a case.

223
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:23,241
We're looking into it.
Just showin' him around.

224
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,678
Hey, you kids, uh, playin'
with the training room?

225
00:15:27,786 --> 00:15:31,984
Whoa! Man, this place is
way better than college.

226
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,457
Ange-babe, uh, Wes is requesting
your presence upstairs.

227
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,460
Has a little demon info
for your peepers.

228
00:15:38,697 --> 00:15:41,757
- It's nice meeting you.
- You're in college?

229
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:43,767
- Yeah.
- Where at?

230
00:15:43,869 --> 00:15:47,202
- Stanford.
- Really?

231
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:50,741
<i>- [Angel] That's them.</i>
- Kith'harn demons.

232
00:15:50,842 --> 00:15:52,742
In Los Angeles,
they're the known henchmen...

233
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:56,177
of a warlock called Cyvus Vail.

234
00:15:56,281 --> 00:15:59,512
- What do we know about him?
- He's powerful. Heads up a large demon empire.

235
00:15:59,618 --> 00:16:02,416
- Has tendrils stretching throughout L.A.
- "Tendril" tendrils?

236
00:16:02,521 --> 00:16:04,819
- Metaphor tendrils.
- What does he want with me?

237
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:08,324
<i>Lfhe's using his Kith'harn demons,</i>
<i>he's not trying to remain anonymous.</i>

238
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,724
- Where are you going?
- To go visit Mr. Vail.

239
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:13,525
- I'll come with.
- No. You're here.

240
00:16:13,632 --> 00:16:15,725
We know hardly anything about this man.
If he's trying to bait you...

241
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:17,825
- It's not up for discussion.
- At least take backup.

242
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:20,063
I said I'd take care of it, Wes!
Drop it.

243
00:16:44,262 --> 00:16:47,197
Get me everything you can find
on Cyvus Vail.

244
00:16:51,703 --> 00:16:54,672
[Air Hissing]

245
00:16:56,875 --> 00:17:00,572
- [Equipment Squeaking]
- [Hissing Intensifies]

00:17:09,054 --> 00:17:11,022
[Labored Breath]

247
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:24,892
Did you kill
all of my guards?

248
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:27,130
- All the ones I could find.
<i>- Mmm.</i>

249
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:30,231
I should have given them
the day off. Mmm.

250
00:17:38,617 --> 00:17:41,347
I wasn't trying
to kill your son, you know.

251
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:46,350
I simply needed him
to understand...

252
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,449
what he is capable of.

253
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,462
- How do you know about Connor?
- I built him.

254
00:18:01,306 --> 00:18:03,331
These are everything
the clerk had on Vail.

255
00:18:03,441 --> 00:18:08,378
And <i>this</i> was down wandering
around Human Resources.

256
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,812
- Spike is resting.
- Thank you, Harmony.

00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:18,555
<i>Here we go. Vail listings</i>
<i>under "accounts paid."</i>

258
00:18:18,657 --> 00:18:21,353
- Wolfram and Hart did business with him?
<i>- Yeah, it looks like...</i>

259
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:24,724
he was one of their go-to warlocks
when it came to the magical mojo.

260
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:27,229
<i>He specialized in</i>
<i>memory restructuring...</i>

261
00:18:27,332 --> 00:18:29,732
<i>mind control,</i>
<i>temporal shifts.</i>

262
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:34,134
- Oh, boy.
- What is it?

263
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,907
You could buy Bolivia for
what we paid him on this one.

264
00:18:40,445 --> 00:18:42,913
Not just him.
He supervised some of...

265
00:18:43,014 --> 00:18:45,005
the most powerful sorcerers
on the West Coast.

266
00:18:45,116 --> 00:18:49,416
With manpower like that,
I'm guessin' he wasn't doin' card tricks.

267
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:51,682
Some sort of reality shift, and it...

268
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,020
Huh.

269
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,387
What?

270
00:18:57,262 --> 00:19:00,595
It happened on the day
we took over Wolfram and Hart.

271
00:19:00,699 --> 00:19:04,430
Could you help me up?
I'd have one of my guards do it, but...

272
00:19:04,536 --> 00:19:07,300
[Labored Breathing]
Well, you know.

273
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:09,498
Thank you.

274
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,337
[Gasps]

275
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:17,040
When Connor was five,
he got lost in a department store.

276
00:19:17,148 --> 00:19:18,410
[Gasps]

277
00:19:18,516 --> 00:19:22,111
He wandered off while
his family was shopping.

278
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,848
It scared the poor child
nearly half to death.

279
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,584
- That never happened!
- Yes.

280
00:19:27,692 --> 00:19:30,456
But he remembers
it happening.

281
00:19:30,562 --> 00:19:32,962
[Labored Breathing Continues]

282
00:19:39,004 --> 00:19:43,634
He remembers screaming
in the middle of the store.

283
00:19:43,742 --> 00:19:48,111
<i>He remembers his mother</i>
<i>rushing towards him...</i>

284
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:51,512
and he remembers his father...

285
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:54,642
sweeping him up into his arms.

286
00:19:55,854 --> 00:20:01,554
- You built his memories.
- I did. [Sighs]

287
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:05,959
He is some of my finest work.

288
00:20:06,064 --> 00:20:10,194
- What do you want?
- I need someone dead...

289
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:13,793
a demon... named Sahjhan.

290
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:15,930
Sahjhan.

291
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:21,771
I believe you
tussled with him before.

292
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,781
He's a nasty little cur.

293
00:20:26,818 --> 00:20:29,582
He's gone.
I trapped him in a bottle.

294
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:33,020
An urn, actually.

295
00:20:35,226 --> 00:20:37,751
It's a morbid thing.

296
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,955
It doesn't really go
with my decor.

297
00:20:40,065 --> 00:20:41,965
He's trapped.
Let him rot.

298
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:44,900
Urns tend to break.

299
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:49,131
Long-lost enemies
tend to return.

300
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,734
<i>I need finality to my affairs.</i>

301
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:02,884
Do you know what
an Orlon Window is, Angel?

302
00:21:03,922 --> 00:21:06,447
It's a fascinating
little spell.

303
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,618
<i>It allows warlocks</i>
<i>such as myself...</i>

304
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,560
to see the past
as it once was.

305
00:21:12,664 --> 00:21:15,098
You have to be careful
with it though.

306
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,658
If it were to break around someone
whose mind had been altered...

307
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:23,036
then all his old memories
would come rushing back.

308
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:24,574
Careful, Angel.

309
00:21:26,444 --> 00:21:31,006
<i>I gave Connor his happy life.</i>

310
00:21:31,116 --> 00:21:34,313
Are you certain
you can kill me...

311
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:37,354
<i>before I can</i>
<i>take it away from him?</i>

312
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:44,355
I... built your son.

313
00:21:44,462 --> 00:21:48,228
I am not the sort of man
you want as an enemy.

[Grunts]

315
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:01,540
Fine. I'll do it.
I'll kill Sahjhan.

316
00:22:01,646 --> 00:22:05,241
If it were that simple,
I'd do it myself.

317
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,342
<i>No, the prophecy is quite clear.</i>

318
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:12,253
There is only one person
who can kill Sahjhan.

319
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:15,526
Connor.

320
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:19,791
So, you see our problem.

321
00:22:19,898 --> 00:22:25,632
<i>I turned your son</i>
<i>into a healthy boy...</i>

322
00:22:25,737 --> 00:22:29,173
and now I need you...

323
00:22:29,274 --> 00:22:31,902
to turn him back into a killer.

324
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:44,454
- He wants me to kill somebody?
- A demon... named Sahjhan.

325
00:22:44,556 --> 00:22:46,649
- I fought him before.
- Why me?

326
00:22:46,758 --> 00:22:49,352
- Why do I have to do it?
- Because you're special.

327
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,554
There's a prophecy that says
you're the only one who can kill him.

328
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:54,655
Why are we even entertaining this?

329
00:22:54,766 --> 00:22:56,825
Vail's made some convincing threats.

330
00:22:56,935 --> 00:22:58,835
Since when do we give in to threats?

331
00:22:58,937 --> 00:23:01,235
<i>He's not threatening you.</i>
<i>He's threatening my family.</i>

332
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,864
We can't trust anything from Vail.

333
00:23:03,975 --> 00:23:06,808
He did a massive spell the day
we took over Wolfram and Hart.

334
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:09,141
<i>- Until we understand why...</i>
- Is he pretty strong?

335
00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:11,647
- This Sahjhan?
<i>- That's a bit of an understatement.</i>

336
00:23:11,749 --> 00:23:13,910
Last time you fought him,
Sahjhan nearly killed you.

337
00:23:15,453 --> 00:23:20,356
- Is that true?
- This is different.

338
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:23,655
Like I said, you're special.

339
00:23:26,264 --> 00:23:29,825
- We don't have a choice, do we?
<i>- [Wesley] Of course we have a choice.</i>

340
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:32,368
<i>Wejust need time</i>
<i>to figure out what Vail did.</i>

341
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,700
We don't have time.

342
00:23:36,074 --> 00:23:39,532
If I kill Sahjhan,
Vail will leave my family alone?

343
00:23:48,786 --> 00:23:51,084
What are we waitin' for?

344
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:02,691
<i>[Gunn]</i>
<i>Please.! [Coughing]</i>

345
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,065
<i>Please.! Please.!</i>
<i>I'll do whatever you say. Please.!</i>

346
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:10,698
No! No! No!

347
00:24:10,808 --> 00:24:13,436
<i>Sorry to interrupt.</i>

348
00:24:13,544 --> 00:24:15,671
Um, I'll just need a minute.

349
00:24:23,688 --> 00:24:25,656
[Shouts]

350
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,560
Do you know
what this thing is?

351
00:24:36,534 --> 00:24:40,766
It's a gibbet.
Has he put you in it yet?

352
00:24:43,474 --> 00:24:44,941
He'll get around to it.

353
00:24:45,043 --> 00:24:48,444
Eventually, he gets around
to everything down here.

354
00:24:48,546 --> 00:24:50,446
Mr. Gunn,
I'm Marcus Hamilton...

355
00:24:50,548 --> 00:24:52,607
your new liaison
to the senior partners.

356
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:55,185
I have a proposition
for you.

357
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:57,277
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

358
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:03,754
It occurs to us that you
might want to get out of here.

359
00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:07,126
- We can help with that.
- [Chuckling]

360
00:25:08,566 --> 00:25:12,400
You know, I've been by your offices,
seen your friends.

361
00:25:12,503 --> 00:25:17,304
Strange, there's not much activity
on the "Rescue Gunn" front.

362
00:25:20,078 --> 00:25:22,478
We're not asking you for much.
All we need you to do...

363
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,912
Can I have my necklace back?

364
00:25:28,219 --> 00:25:30,312
Come on, Sparky. Let's go.

365
00:25:30,421 --> 00:25:32,719
This heart ain't
gonna cut itself out.

366
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,828
Thank you for your time.

367
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:46,093
<i>- No, no, no.! Please.! Please.! No.!</i>
<i>- [Flesh Tearing]</i>

368
00:25:46,204 --> 00:25:48,570
<i>[Screaming]</i>
<i>No.!</i>

369
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:49,674
<i>You're not alone in this.</i>
<i>I'll be right there with you.</i>

370
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:51,733
<i>You're not alone in this.</i>
<i>I'll be right there with you.</i>

371
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:54,141
You're gonna hold Sahjhan down
while I stab him?

372
00:25:54,245 --> 00:25:57,214
The prophecy doesn't say
you can't have a little help.

373
00:25:57,315 --> 00:26:00,011
- That hardly seems fair.
- Fair's not something we worry about.

374
00:26:00,118 --> 00:26:04,953
Maybe you should.
I'm not a bully.

375
00:26:05,056 --> 00:26:07,251
If I'm gonna do this,
you gotta let me do it my way.

376
00:26:08,826 --> 00:26:10,987
Now I just gotta figure out
what my way is.

377
00:26:11,095 --> 00:26:14,997
- You'll have your whole life for that.
- Might as well start now.

378
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:17,329
All right.
Let me show you a few things.

379
00:26:17,435 --> 00:26:19,335
Well, yeah.

380
00:26:19,437 --> 00:26:21,496
I'm all noble and stuff,
but I'm not an idiot.

381
00:26:21,606 --> 00:26:24,200
I've been in one fight in my entire life,
and you bailed me out of it.

382
00:26:24,308 --> 00:26:29,041
<i>Should I take one of these with me?</i>
<i>An ax or whatever this thing is.</i>

383
00:26:33,117 --> 00:26:35,210
- Sorry.
<i>- That's okay.</i>

384
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,810
Probably, uh, stay away
from the weapons for now.

385
00:26:37,922 --> 00:26:40,652
- Okay. Sorry.
- All right, look.

386
00:26:40,758 --> 00:26:42,919
You're faster than Sahjhan.

387
00:26:43,027 --> 00:26:45,552
Use it.
He talks a lot.

388
00:26:45,663 --> 00:26:48,063
He'll try to lull you into slowing down.
Don't listen.

389
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:50,566
Hit him quick.
Keep moving.

390
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:54,503
Do you really think
I can do this?

391
00:26:55,606 --> 00:26:57,972
I know you can.

392
00:27:00,044 --> 00:27:03,571
You are so concerned
with names, dates, times.

393
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:05,649
Reality's been changed.

394
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,718
Define "change."

395
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:11,311
<i>- The world is as it is.</i>
- Not necessarily.

396
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:14,152
You are a summation
of recollections.

397
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:17,421
Each change is simply
a point of experience.

398
00:27:18,463 --> 00:27:20,431
We are more
than just memories.

399
00:27:20,531 --> 00:27:23,261
And yet Fred changed
the moment her memory did.

400
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:30,438
- Fred's memories were changed?
- In places.

401
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:33,408
Can you see
what they were before?

402
00:27:35,847 --> 00:27:37,838
No. They're gone.

403
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:43,387
Does this change
your view of Fred?

404
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,116
Is she still the person
you thought she was?

405
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:51,929
No.

406
00:27:54,332 --> 00:27:56,232
None of us are.

407
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,301
This place smells like
a retirement home.

408
00:28:08,412 --> 00:28:11,609
<i>Welcome.</i>
<i>I've been waiting for you.</i>

409
00:28:11,716 --> 00:28:13,980
- Oh, Lord, look at him.
- Shh!

410
00:28:14,085 --> 00:28:16,952
Listen, Vail,
we won't be staying long.

411
00:28:17,054 --> 00:28:20,148
Here's how it works.
I kill this Sahjhan thing, and we walk.

412
00:28:20,258 --> 00:28:22,488
You come near my family again,
and I'll slit your throat.

413
00:28:22,593 --> 00:28:26,495
And if that doesn't kill you,
I'll chop your whole head off.

414
00:28:26,597 --> 00:28:28,792
And if that doesn't work, I'll...

415
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,165
I'll just keep stabbing you till you...
till you bleed to death.

416
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:35,671
<i>- Understand?</i>
- I do.

417
00:28:36,807 --> 00:28:38,775
Good.

418
00:28:38,876 --> 00:28:43,108
- So, where is he?
- Right through there.

419
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:48,946
Okay.

420
00:28:50,488 --> 00:28:53,787
- See you later.
- Wait. Listen. He's gonna talk to you.

421
00:28:53,891 --> 00:28:55,882
- Don't let him distract you.
- I won't.

422
00:28:55,993 --> 00:28:58,393
- Even if he's on the ground,
do not take your eyes off him.
- Okay.

423
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:02,262
- Whatever you do, do not...
- Dude, you're startin' to freak me out.

424
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,425
Right. Sorry.

425
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:07,333
Oh.

426
00:29:07,438 --> 00:29:09,599
Sorry. Go get him.

427
00:29:10,808 --> 00:29:13,333
I'll be right over here.

428
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,354
What am I suppo...

429
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:29,188
Okay.

430
00:29:29,293 --> 00:29:33,354
<i>- He can't see us anymore.</i>
- Why not?

431
00:29:33,464 --> 00:29:36,490
I can't risk
Sahjhan getting loose.

432
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:41,229
He has a nasty habit
of trying to kill me.

433
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:47,141
<i>But don't worry.</i>
<i>Your boy is very brave.</i>

434
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:53,080
I'm sure he'll do you proud.

435
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:59,056
[Sighs]

436
00:29:59,156 --> 00:30:01,351
Open sesame, or whatever.

437
00:30:22,713 --> 00:30:24,237
[Chuckles]

438
00:30:24,348 --> 00:30:26,782
Thank you, mortal...

439
00:30:26,884 --> 00:30:30,012
for releasing me
from my cursed prison.

440
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:34,284
In gratitude,
I grant you three wishes.

441
00:30:34,392 --> 00:30:37,793
- Really?
- Nah, I'm just messin' with you.

442
00:30:37,895 --> 00:30:40,625
- Oh.
- [Chuckling]

443
00:30:40,731 --> 00:30:43,757
I do appreciate it though.
[Grunts]

444
00:30:43,868 --> 00:30:48,168
- That urn wasn't exactly a day at the spa.
- [Bones Crack]

445
00:30:48,272 --> 00:30:51,241
- I owe you one.
- Right.

446
00:30:51,342 --> 00:30:55,005
Well, before you
start trying to kiss me...

447
00:30:55,112 --> 00:30:57,637
I should probably tell you,
you and I...

448
00:30:57,748 --> 00:31:01,650
we're, uh...
we're supposed to fight.

449
00:31:01,752 --> 00:31:04,949
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

450
00:31:05,056 --> 00:31:07,456
Now, why would you want...

451
00:31:10,561 --> 00:31:12,529
Ah.

452
00:31:13,731 --> 00:31:17,030
- You're him.
- Yeah. I'm me.

453
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:20,162
Hi.

454
00:31:20,271 --> 00:31:22,171
You can take a moment
if you want.

455
00:31:22,273 --> 00:31:25,299
There's some weapons and stuff
over here if you think you'll need 'em.

456
00:31:27,378 --> 00:31:30,074
- Thanks.
- He's talkin' to him.

457
00:31:30,181 --> 00:31:32,672
Why is he talkin' to him?
I told him not to talk to him.

458
00:31:32,783 --> 00:31:35,183
Been a while since
we've seen each other.

459
00:31:35,286 --> 00:31:38,016
How'd Quor'toth
work out for you anyway?

460
00:31:38,122 --> 00:31:41,285
Uh, worked out great.
Thanks for askin'.

461
00:31:41,392 --> 00:31:44,953
You know, I've had a long time
to plan for this moment.

462
00:31:46,731 --> 00:31:51,600
I figured you'd be
a lot more... intimidating.

463
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:54,500
Yeah. Well, I figured...

464
00:31:54,605 --> 00:31:58,541
I was going to Tony Roma's
with my folks tonight, but I'm here.

465
00:31:58,642 --> 00:32:01,543
- Learn to cope.
- I'll work on it.

466
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:09,375
Sorry. Not your fight.

- Did it?
- Yeah.

470
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,855
I'm sorry. Do you need
to call a time-out?

471
00:32:21,966 --> 00:32:23,957
No, I'm all right.

472
00:32:28,172 --> 00:32:30,504
Open the doorway right now.

473
00:32:30,608 --> 00:32:33,668
Or you'll what? Relax.

474
00:32:33,778 --> 00:32:36,747
Your son has to grow up
sooner or later.

475
00:32:36,847 --> 00:32:40,840
Sit back and watch
his future unfold.

476
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:48,820
There's no need to bring back
the past if we don't have to.

You know, I went to a lot
of trouble to get rid of you.

- You sold us out to Wolfram and Hart.
- Be careful.

Is this your 30 pieces

Wes, give me that.

He doesn't follow you
any longer.

Was Fred the price?

496
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:45,073
No. Wes, I can explain.

497
00:34:45,175 --> 00:34:48,201
- Just put that down.
- Why are you so afraid of this?

498
00:34:49,613 --> 00:34:51,513
He said it would
bring back the past.

499
00:34:51,615 --> 00:34:56,052
- Would it undo what you've done?
- No.

500
00:34:58,756 --> 00:35:03,386
- It won't bring her back.
- Let's find out.

501
00:35:03,494 --> 00:35:08,522
No! Please.
You have to trust me.

502
00:35:08,632 --> 00:35:12,659
I can't. Not anymore.

503
00:35:18,676 --> 00:35:20,075
[Crying]

504
00:35:41,665 --> 00:35:44,190
[Gasps]

505
00:35:53,911 --> 00:35:55,879
Connor.

506
00:36:07,825 --> 00:36:09,452
Lucky shot.

507
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:43,657
Connor?

508
00:36:45,062 --> 00:36:48,225
Whoa. You see that?

509
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:50,960
I went a little hard core
there for a second.

510
00:36:51,068 --> 00:36:53,969
That guy made me
really cranky.

511
00:36:57,341 --> 00:37:00,538
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

512
00:37:00,644 --> 00:37:03,112
I guess.

513
00:37:03,213 --> 00:37:06,979
I don't really like people
touching my neck, you know?

514
00:37:08,419 --> 00:37:11,013
Connor, uh...

515
00:37:11,121 --> 00:37:12,884
Hey...

516
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:17,324
can we... get outta here?

517
00:37:17,428 --> 00:37:22,161
I'd like to go back,
see my parents.

518
00:37:26,737 --> 00:37:28,864
This whole fighting thing...
I'm not...

519
00:37:29,907 --> 00:37:32,137
I'm not really sure
it's for me.

520
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:47,584
<i>[Illyria]</i>
<i>You betrayed Angel.</i>

521
00:37:50,861 --> 00:37:52,829
You stole his son.

522
00:37:53,864 --> 00:37:55,832
He tried to kill you.

523
00:37:58,001 --> 00:38:00,492
Yes.

524
00:38:00,604 --> 00:38:03,232
Are these the memories
you needed back?

525
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:07,543
Does this now
make you Wesley?

526
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:14,350
At least I know
what happened.

527
00:38:14,451 --> 00:38:16,419
Do you?

528
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:21,049
There are two sets
of memories...

529
00:38:21,158 --> 00:38:23,922
those that happened
and those that are fabricated.

530
00:38:25,295 --> 00:38:27,320
It's hard to tell
which is which.

531
00:38:32,503 --> 00:38:34,767
Try to push reality
out of your mind.

532
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,907
Focus on
the other memories.

533
00:38:41,545 --> 00:38:43,513
They were created
for a reason.

534
00:38:45,015 --> 00:38:47,609
To hide from the truth?

535
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:54,052
To endure it.

536
00:39:05,569 --> 00:39:07,969
I thought sunlight
burned you up.

537
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:14,199
- [Chuckles] Special glass.
- Cool.

538
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:18,475
You should, like, make a whole suit
out of it, like the pope has.

539
00:39:19,683 --> 00:39:21,651
How's your dad?

540
00:39:23,554 --> 00:39:25,886
He's fine.
They're releasing him now.

541
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:30,055
<i>I should warn you.</i>
<i>He's pretty pissed.</i>

542
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,060
I told him that you
took me out demon fighting...

543
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:34,062
and, uh,
almost got me killed.

544
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:36,064
He wants to have
a talk with you.

545
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:39,829
- All right. I'll, uh...
- I'm kidding.

546
00:39:39,937 --> 00:39:42,428
Man, you gotta lighten up.

547
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:44,803
<i>He thinks we spent</i>
<i>the whole night doing tests.</i>

548
00:39:44,908 --> 00:39:47,934
I told him I could bench-press,
like, 1,000 pounds.

549
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:54,306
What are you gonna tell them
about who you are?

550
00:39:56,587 --> 00:40:00,353
The truth, more or less.
I'll tell them that I'm different.

551
00:40:00,457 --> 00:40:04,518
<i>I'll tell them it's...</i>
<i>actually a good thing.</i>

552
00:40:04,628 --> 00:40:06,528
I'll tell them
to stop worrying so much.

553
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:10,792
- Well, they're parents.
- Yeah, I know.

554
00:40:12,402 --> 00:40:14,597
They'll feel a lot better knowing
you're looking out for me.

555
00:40:14,705 --> 00:40:18,641
We still haven't found Vail,
but we will.

556
00:40:19,743 --> 00:40:21,643
I'm not too worried
about him.

557
00:40:21,745 --> 00:40:23,770
There's nothing he can show me
I haven't already seen.

558
00:40:27,317 --> 00:40:31,981
Anyway, I just wanted
to say good-bye.

559
00:40:34,157 --> 00:40:36,853
I gotta go back
to my life now.

560
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,191
Oh.

561
00:40:40,297 --> 00:40:43,994
<i>Do you really</i>
<i>have to leave... right now?</i>

562
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:49,138
I kind of think I should.

563
00:40:51,608 --> 00:40:53,508
I need to take care
of my parents.

564
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:56,477
This isn't their world.
They really don't feel safe here.

565
00:40:57,881 --> 00:41:00,679
You gotta do what you can
to protect your family.

566
00:41:04,354 --> 00:41:06,914
I learned that from my father.

567
00:41:28,545 --> 00:41:30,740
<i>[Elevator Bell Dings]</i>

568
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:20,061
Grr! Arrgh!
