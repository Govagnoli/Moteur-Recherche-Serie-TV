1
00:00:02,529 --> 00:00:03,580
We're doomed.

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:05,759
- We can make a break for it.
- Impossible.

3
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:08,300
- Front exit?
- We'd be spotted instantly.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,460
Back door?

5
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:13,419
- Blocked.
- That's it, then.

6
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:16,739
- We're trapped.
- We might try shouting "fire!"

7
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:19,850
It's not a crowded theater.

8
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:22,460
One day I might, yes...

9
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,989
...many years from now,
when I've lost my looks a little.

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,070
Do not laugh.

11
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:33,009
Only another hour.

12
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:37,170
I mean, of course, a time will come...

13
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:40,250
...when Torvald is not....

14
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:42,469
He's not....

15
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,340
- Line!
- "Is not as devoted to me."

16
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,469
Perhaps two.

17
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:50,340
- What?
- "Is not as devoted."

18
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,710
Right, right, right.

19
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:56,479
When Torvald is not as devoted to me.

20
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,189
And I thought I knew eternity.

21
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,689
So, what did you guys think?

22
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,799
Well, your projection was excellent.

23
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,010
I could hear every word,
and we were way in the back.

24
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,500
Okay, so I was loud,
but was I any good?

25
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,849
You took the role
and made it your own.

26
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,229
Really? Thanks.
Angel, was I good?

27
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:16,110
- I wouldn't say if I didn't think so.
- Thanks.

28
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:18,270
- You didn't say.
- I didn't?

29
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,830
- I don't believe it!
- It was a night I'll never forget.

30
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,490
That's Oliver Simon!

31
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,680
Who?

32
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:28,569
One of the most important
talent managers in town.

33
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:30,689
I met him at a party.
You were there.

34
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:32,389
Oh, right.

35
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,009
- He gave me his card.
- What?

36
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:39,620
I worked him all night
and he gave you his card?

37
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:42,020
He thought I had a "quality."

38
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:44,710
Look who he's with!

39
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,860
Can we please go now?

40
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:48,830
- Rebecca Lowell!
- Who?

41
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:52,849
Raven! She played
Raven in On Your Own,

42
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,099
Hit television show,
on for, like, 9½ years.

43
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,560
- Do either of you even own a TV?
- I don't.

44
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,509
It was a seminal show,
canceled by the idiot network.

45
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:07,250
I was gonna picket, but
I didn't have comfortable shoes....

46
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,349
Angel!

47
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,280
Oh, my God, Rebecca!

48
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:27,449
Are you all right, darling?

49
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,240
Oh, my God! What was she like?

50
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,500
Excuse me. Are you all right?

51
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,270
Oh, he's fine. It was such an honor
to save your life, Miss Lowell.

52
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,840
Thank you.
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.

53
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,979
Cordelia Chase.
I'm so glad you weren't--

54
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,689
Oh, he doesn't even know who you are.

55
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:54,689
You don't know me?

56
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:58,669
Sure, he doesn't. I'm sure
he'll accept a small reward anyway.

57
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,030
- No, thanks.
- We're not gonna be held up here.

58
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,400
Oliver, down.
He doesn't know who I am.

59
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:07,080
He's culturally retarded that way.

60
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,800
I'm Rebecca.

61
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:11,139
Angel.

62
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,069
So, you make a habit
of this sort of thing?

63
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,769
It's only like his purpose in life.
Angel's the Dark Revenger.

64
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,420
Only not too dark. Happy dark.

65
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,050
- I got a card in here somewhere.
- Cordelia.

66
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,350
Oh, God. Who called E.T.?

67
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,750
- Emma Thompson?
- Entertainment Tonight, doofus.

68
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,360
- They're here for the party.
- Oliver....

69
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:34,360
It's gonna be all over
the tabs come morning, Beck.

70
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,899
We might as well just put
our own spin on it first.

71
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:40,610
- Look, I'd like to apologize....
- Oh, he does that.

72
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:45,579
Here's our card. If you need rescuing
or just want to pal around, call us.

73
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:48,620
- Let go.
- Come on.

74
00:04:56,769 --> 00:05:00,319
I made the papers. Last night's all
over the front page of the Calendar!

75
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,069
Really? There was a
reviewer at your play?

76
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,300
What? No! Like a reviewer needs
to see some 100-year-old play.

77
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,629
The thing with Rebecca Lowell.
I'm in the picture.

78
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,750
- Where?
- Right there.

79
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,990
- Where?
- Right there, next to Rebecca.

80
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:18,079
That's my elbow.

81
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,990
Can we forget about Rebecca Lowell?
I mean, we ran into an actor.

82
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:26,120
It's Hollywood, it happens.
We have a nice photo of Cordelia's...

83
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:28,839
...elbow and an article about
me saving a TV star.

84
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:32,160
- Just because the paper--
- There's no mention of you.

85
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,449
- What?
- Nothing.

86
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:40,199
Well, that's good, right?

87
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,870
I mean, this high-profile thing
isn't our deal anyway.

88
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,040
What?

89
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,040
Rebecca hasn't had a series since
On Your Own was canceled.

90
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,860
That was almost
a season and a half ago.

91
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,300
And they say Los Angeles
has no seasons.

92
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:57,490
We have to use this now, before she's
just another E! True Hollywood Story,

93
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,360
When word gets out that you're
protector to the stars...

94
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,689
...they'll line up at the door.

95
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,120
Glad I beat the crowd, then.

96
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,829
Oh, my God. No!

97
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,610
I didn't mean-- Coffee, tea?
We don't have anything good here.

98
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:20,540
But our intern would be happy
to get you something, Miss Lowell.

99
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:24,079
Can we talk?

100
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,300
Sure, right in here.

101
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,839
Stay.

102
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,379
Stay.

103
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,600
- You're not fond of sunshine.
- I'm a night person.

104
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:53,759
Me too.

105
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,620
It makes it easier to hide.

106
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:02,019
You're in the wrong
business if you want to hide.

107
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,290
So you never really saw even one
single episode of On Your Own?

108
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:09,850
No.

109
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:13,100
Well, stop by.

110
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,610
I'll give you a private screening of
the episode I didn't win the Emmy for.

111
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,379
Thanks for the invitation, but....

112
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,290
Look, I've been famous since I was 14.

113
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:30,319
It's refreshing to meet
someone who doesn't care.

114
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,629
Seems you're surrounded by
people who care about you.

115
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,290
They work for me.
They're paid to care.

116
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,620
So how can I help you?

117
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:51,980
I have a stack of these at home.
All the same, written in blood.

118
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,699
He also has my personal
telephone number.

119
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,339
Scary calls in the
middle of the night.

120
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:01,519
Most of my devoted fans are
harmless, but these--

121
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,519
- It's not blood.
- Are you sure?

122
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:08,509
- Have you tried the police?
- Oliver wants me to, but...

123
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,949
...then I'd be just hand-feeding the
story to the Enquirer, No, thanks.

124
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:15,670
How do you know I won't do the same?

125
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:21,170
I don't, but I know you came out of
nowhere and saved my life last night.

126
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,389
I know you didn't ask
for anything in return.

127
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:29,540
And I know I feel safer in this
office than I do in my own home.

128
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:37,629
I'm up for a new series.

129
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:42,909
One of those make-or-break gigs
for Rebecca's career, part two.

130
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,110
I need peace of mind.

131
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,529
The car that ran you down was...

132
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,269
...a green, freshly-painted
'76 Chevy Nova.

133
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:02,330
I caught the plates, ran the I.D.
It was stolen.

134
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,059
And I'm sorry, but
I can't take your case.

135
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:09,710
Are you insane?

136
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,000
- I don't understand.
- Give that information to your people.

137
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,460
They'll find the guy.
You don't need me.

138
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,720
My first big connection in Hollywood,
and you throw her out of the office.

139
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:30,200
Ever hear of networking?

140
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,080
- Cordelia--
- No!

141
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:35,169
He can fight off donkey demons
who rip people's guts out...

142
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,700
...but he can't help a defenseless
actress from a psycho?

143
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,679
What is your thing?

144
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:44,139
He likes her.

145
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:47,700
He's afraid of getting close.

146
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:51,409
Because of his curse?

147
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:54,730
You'd have to get awfully close
for that to kick in.

148
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:56,740
Meanwhile, you could help me.

149
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,490
The person who needs
help is Miss Lowell.

150
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,399
Right, he could be helping us both.
Think of the karma.

151
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:05,879
This may not be
the right case for you.

152
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,490
Maybe we can find somebody
else to help her.

153
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,950
Oh, no. Not now!

154
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:15,799
What's this I see in my vision?

155
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:20,269
It's a figure, a woman.
It's Rebecca! She's in danger.

156
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,029
Terrible danger!

157
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:29,919
Great, just great.

158
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,539
Because Mr. Distant has intimacy
issues, I lose my brush with fame.

159
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:38,799
- Jeez, Cordelia, she's just a person.
- Spoken like a true non-person.

160
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:43,289
Just knowing a star
makes your life better.

161
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:45,799
I'd do anything to live in her world!

162
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:51,259
They make an incision behind the jaw,
under the eyes and suction out fat.

163
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:54,799
Be proactive with deterioration.

164
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:57,620
- Right.
- Christiana had it done at 24.

165
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:09,169
Are you...?

166
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,690
Miss Lowell, are you okay?
I'm calling the police.

167
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,639
Yes, Oliver, I am sure.
I'd rather be alone tonight.

168
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,559
After all this? Don't you
at least want someone in the house?

169
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,289
Half the LAPD is camped out on my
front lawn. He won't be back tonight.

170
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,139
All right, I should probably
go deal with the press.

171
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,299
You do that, Oliver.

172
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,629
I love you, kiddo.

173
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,889
- You know that.
- I know.

174
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:17,590
I know you're still here.

175
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:26,169
I'm not what you think.

176
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:28,360
You're not?

177
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,129
Because...

178
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,649
...no reflection,
dark private office...

179
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,830
...knowing those letters
weren't written in blood.

180
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,860
I guess what I would think
is "vampire."

181
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,649
- Then again--
- Which is impossible.

182
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,179
Bela Lugosi, Gary Oldman,
they're vampires.

183
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,370
I believed
Frank Langella's performance--

184
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,600
This is real.

185
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,769
You're real.

186
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,639
Do you drink blood?

187
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,360
Yeah, but not people.

188
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,320
- You're not a killer.
- I gave that up.

189
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,450
Well, there's a support group for
everything in this town, I guess.

190
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:11,419
- It's a long story.
- How long?

191
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:13,919
- A hundred years?
- Two...

192
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,250
...hundred and some change.

193
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,000
Two hundred years?
But you look....

194
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,669
If I touch you, will you be cold?

195
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:29,309
I've felt colder.

196
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,980
You're really not afraid.

197
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:34,539
No.

198
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,590
- Most people who saw what you saw--
- I'm not "most people."

199
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:43,750
I lied to Oliver.

200
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,129
I don't really want
to be alone tonight.

201
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,120
- He took the case?
- Yes, he phoned early this morning.

202
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:03,389
We follow up on the stolen car.

203
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,000
- What made him change his mind?
- Apparently, he didn't.

204
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,399
He was keeping tabs on her all along.

205
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,750
- And he called you early this morning?
- Yes.

206
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,049
- Weren't you lobbying for this?
- How early?

207
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:18,210
Did he spend the night?

208
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,190
- One assumes.
- Great.

209
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:23,820
He spent the night with the
fantasy of millions, all alone.

210
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,210
- "Protecting" her.
- You're worried about the curse.

211
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,549
- I wouldn't.
- Hey!

212
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:31,759
You weren't around the last
time Angel went mental.

213
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:34,940
I was on the first wave
of the cleanup crew.

214
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:39,340
He knows perfect happiness, he goes
evil. Don't tell me not to worry.

215
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,879
Angel's moment of happiness
occurred when he was with Buffy.

216
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,399
Do you realize how rare that is?
True happiness?

217
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:51,340
- He won't find it with an actress.
- What's that supposed to mean?

218
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:56,610
I was....

219
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,279
- I meant TV actress.
- Save it.

220
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,580
Angel spent the night at Rebecca's.
I owe it to that poor girl...

221
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:08,919
...to see if he wound up chowing
down on my one link to fame.

222
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:18,870
Cordelia, you're here.
And you brought a cross.

223
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:22,200
Along with three double
half-caf nonfat skinny lattés.

224
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:23,970
- And a cross.
- Well...

225
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:26,149
...judging by the outfit,
it's safe to come in.

226
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:29,330
Evil Angel never would've
worn those pants.

227
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,529
- Where's Rebecca?
- She had a lunch to go to.

228
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,809
Lunch? It's still noon.

229
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,279
Shouldn't that be more
of a brunch for her?

230
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,169
She was up before dawn, working out.

231
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,779
So she went to lunch and just left you
here to rummage through her things?

232
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:50,889
No.

233
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,559
I told her I'm a vampire.
Daytime patio dining is out.

234
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,580
Did you just make a joke?

235
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,440
I really told her.

236
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,440
Wow. So do you think she'd
still set me up with her manager?

237
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:15,309
- You look terrific.
- They canceled, didn't they?

238
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:22,759
Just postponed.
Scheduling conflicts. It's nothing.

239
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,900
- Oliver, you said I had this part.
- Yes.

240
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,970
They want you to come into
their offices and read.

241
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:31,869
Read?

242
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:35,430
Know how long it's been since
I've read for anything?

243
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:40,400
A season and a half off the air
and suddenly I'm nobody again.

244
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:44,400
- Not according to these.
- According to those...

245
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:47,079
...I slept with Ernest Borgnine
and I'm bulimic.

246
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:49,829
I hear Borgnine's
a very skilled lover.

247
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:53,009
Listen to me.
Poor little rich girl.

248
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:57,980
- We've all got problems.
- Yeah, well...

249
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,430
...right now my problem is getting
this guy off my back...

250
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:04,450
...long enough to win this part.

251
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:09,200
I've been so distracted lately,
I haven't had time to play the game.

252
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:10,980
Now I'm afraid I'm losing.

253
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,319
- Here you are, Miss Lowell.
- Thank you, Maria.

254
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:27,279
You're what, a 44 long?

255
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,960
- Why?
- I have a premiere tonight.

256
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,349
Can't go without my bodyguard, can I?

257
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:46,299
Raven! Raven!

258
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,180
Raven! Raven, over here!

259
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,339
Raven. They think that
I'm the character I play.

260
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,579
The movie's in the alleyway?

261
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:28,720
No, I just come to these
things for the photo-op.

262
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,950
My driver meets me out back.

263
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:35,349
If I had to sit through every one
of these, boredom would kill me.

264
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:41,930
Rebecca, get down!

265
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:01,440
Rebecca....

266
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,900
It's okay. I'm here.

267
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:15,240
--any notes I got
if you want to compare them.

268
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,910
I just want to go over your
statement one more time, sir.

269
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,230
Rebecca.

270
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:27,089
Not again. Are you all right?
I came as soon as I heard.

271
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:31,009
- And when was that, exactly?
- What do you mean?

272
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,569
I know the stalker. I've seen him.

273
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,339
At your house.

274
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:41,559
He's a stuntman.
You used to represent him.

275
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,339
Oh, I didn't get a good look.

276
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,680
Oh, come on, Oliver. My private phone
number, how to get into my house...

277
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:54,269
...that I skipped the movie at a
premiere. Only you know all that.

278
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,640
I never would have let you get hurt.
You must believe that.

279
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:05,069
The publicity might help you get
the series. I did it out of love.

280
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,250
I don't pay you to love me.

281
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:12,309
No. That you get for free.

282
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,680
I didn't get the part, did I?

283
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:21,519
I was gonna tell you tonight.

284
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:26,630
The network feels that
you're too "mature" for the role.

285
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,759
It may not seem that way now, but
once we distance you from Raven--

286
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:35,700
Oliver, the series is in syndication.
She'll always be there.

287
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:39,519
- Beck--
- Looking younger than me forever.

288
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,259
Sweetie, your life is not over at 24.

289
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,630
I'm not 24! I'm--

290
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:50,990
Raven is 22. She will always be 22.

291
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:54,940
All right, so she'll always be 22.
She's not you.

292
00:21:56,369 --> 00:22:00,160
And we're gonna have to face it
that nobody stays young forever.

293
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:19,180
I got the preliminary forensics report
from the theater.

294
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:20,599
- The bullets were--
- Blanks.

295
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,400
No, they were blanks.

296
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:28,450
The shots never connected. There were
no holes in the wall, nothing.

297
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,480
- When does a killer use blanks?
- When he's not a killer. It's fake.

298
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:35,380
Miss Lowell?

299
00:22:35,569 --> 00:22:37,990
I don't think she knows.
How do I tell her?

300
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,539
This is good news, isn't it?

301
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:45,180
Depends on what would bother her more:
being stalked or not being stalked.

302
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,670
- Actresses.
- Tell me about it.

303
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,950
Thanks for coming.
I'm glad you could find the time.

304
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:57,259
You were being serious?

305
00:22:57,769 --> 00:23:01,839
Big important stars ask me to lunch
and a shopping spree all the time...

306
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:03,829
...in my dreams!

307
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:06,329
I'm just an actress, like you.

308
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:10,069
You're an actress, I'm someone
who auditions and auditions....

309
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:15,390
That's how it is when you first start
out. I'm sure you'll make it big.

310
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,470
Sorry, I didn't mean
to squeal like that in public.

311
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:26,650
Thank you for calling. You must have
a ton of friends you could've asked.

312
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,609
None of them would know what
to buy a 200-year-old vampire...

313
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:32,630
...as a thank-you gift.

314
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:36,220
He is impossible to buy for.
What on earth does he need?

315
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:41,269
So, what's his story, anyway?
How did he become what he is?

316
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,559
- Oh, God. You got eight hours?
- I've got all day.

317
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,430
I won't do that again.

318
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,569
I was just coming to see you.

319
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,559
There was no one upstairs so I just
came down. I hope that's okay.

320
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,220
Sure, come on in.

321
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,500
I went shopping
to pick out a thank-you gift...

322
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:18,200
...but what do you get the guy
who's seen everything?

323
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,210
So I figured,
what's better than Dom?

324
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:27,089
- You can-- You do--
- I can drink other liquids, yeah.

325
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:31,259
Good. Have you got glasses?

326
00:24:32,089 --> 00:24:35,809
Yeah. Yeah. Please sit down.

327
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:51,869
Wow! It's sort of what
you'd expect...

328
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,099
...and sort of not.

329
00:24:56,089 --> 00:24:58,339
Well, there's no coffin.

330
00:24:59,089 --> 00:25:00,910
That hadn't even crossed my mind.

331
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:03,670
Rebecca....

332
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,440
There's something I have to tell you.
Your stalker--

333
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:13,930
Oh, that. I already know.

334
00:25:14,089 --> 00:25:15,170
You do?

335
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,740
It turns out we share representation.

336
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:22,089
- Oliver.
- Set the whole thing up...

337
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:26,180
...to revive my flagging career.

338
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:30,380
It didn't work.
I didn't get the part.

339
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:33,319
I'm sorry.

340
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:36,170
Yeah.

341
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:52,829
Have you ever....
Oh, this is so dumb!

342
00:25:53,089 --> 00:25:54,880
Have you ever...

343
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,329
...done that thing where you link arms
and sip champagne?

344
00:25:59,089 --> 00:26:01,299
It's sort of a good-luck thing.

345
00:26:20,089 --> 00:26:22,829
- Your shirt! I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

346
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,369
It's kind of fun. Cold...

347
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,880
...but fun.

348
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,680
I'll be right back.

349
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:52,750
You know, the next time
I try something so corny...

350
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:56,599
...I promise not to ruin your wardrobe
in the process.

351
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:06,599
Let's try this again.

352
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,019
A toast:

353
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:20,559
To the end of an ending
and the beginning of a beginning.

354
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,650
Oh, Wesley!

355
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:39,430
I got your pages. What's happening?

356
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:42,500
I may have done something terrible.

357
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:47,410
- I went shopping with Rebecca.
- That's terrible?

358
00:27:48,089 --> 00:27:51,250
No! That was fantastic.
They close off stores for her.

359
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,089
Oh, and lunch at Mirabelle.

360
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,970
I had a to-die-for veal fillet
with a light truffle marinade--

361
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,809
- Cordelia.
- Oh, sorry.

362
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:03,769
The whole time Rebecca's real gabby,
asking questions about Angel.

363
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,960
Well, what sorts of questions?

364
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:10,730
Where does Angel hail from,
what's his favorite color...

365
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:16,059
...the specific details on how one
could make herself into a vampire....

366
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:20,650
- Surely you don't think--
- What?

367
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:24,779
That she'd try to maneuver Angel
into an exchange of bodily fluids...

368
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,980
...to keep herself young,
thus saving her career?

369
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:34,759
I used to be....
A long time ago....

370
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,240
I hurt a lot of people.

371
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:40,809
- I don't believe that.
- No.

372
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,839
It's true. I was bad.

373
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,980
Which is why
I have to help people now.

374
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,859
I'm trying to atone.

375
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:51,539
Cordelia says you've saved the world.

376
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:53,900
A couple times I helped.

377
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,319
But I almost had it sucked
into hell once too.

378
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:06,180
Still, don't you think...

379
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:10,309
...after all this time,
you deserve some happiness?

380
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,789
That's probably not a good idea.

381
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:22,549
You smell...so good.

382
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:28,630
So warm.

383
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:35,940
I miss that.

384
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:40,250
You don't have to.

385
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:45,170
You can have what you've been craving
all these long, empty years.

386
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:50,089
We both can. Forever.

387
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,079
What are you saying?

388
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,329
You know what I'm saying.

389
00:30:04,289 --> 00:30:05,619
Do it.

390
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,500
We won't have to be lonely,
either of us, ever again.

391
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,059
You don't know what you're asking me.

392
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:17,609
Of course I know. I'm not a fool.
There's a price. I understand that.

393
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,440
You couldn't possibly understand.

394
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:24,109
I wasn't afraid when I looked
into the mirror and you weren't there.

395
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:28,130
I didn't scream. I didn't run.
I understood.

396
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:33,000
No, you weren't afraid. You looked
into that mirror and saw yourself.

397
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:36,009
That's all you ever see.
That's what scares you.

398
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,670
This isn't about the way the studio
or your fans see you.

399
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:41,759
It's about how you see yourself.

400
00:30:42,089 --> 00:30:45,180
Your reflection has been corrupted
into something unrecognizable.

401
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,440
You want it to stay the same?

402
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:51,680
What you really want
is to make it disappear.

403
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:56,119
You're supposed to help people.

404
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,660
Help me.

405
00:31:00,089 --> 00:31:01,529
You want me to help you?

406
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:03,750
Fine.

407
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,309
- What are you doing?
- It's a big decision, eternity.

408
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,809
You need a taste of what
you're asking for.

409
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:20,660
I'm sorry.

410
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,750
What did you do to me?

411
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,220
Nothing.

412
00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:34,599
You put something in my drink.

413
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:39,529
I wanted you to relax a little.
Lower the defenses a little.

414
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:42,539
- What was it?
- Just a little happy pill.

415
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:47,660
Oh, God.

416
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:52,450
- I'm so sorry.
- Everybody's so sorry.

417
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:58,019
- I just wanted us both to be happy.
- But I am happy.

418
00:31:58,289 --> 00:31:59,660
- You are?
- Yes.

419
00:32:06,089 --> 00:32:07,460
Perfectly happy.

420
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,650
Angel?

421
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:16,049
You look a little nervous.

422
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,680
You....

423
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:20,569
- You're--
- Free!

424
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,690
You freed me.

425
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,950
God, I love this stuff. Wow!

426
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,990
Let me get the name
of your dealer before I kill you.

427
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,750
- Kill me?
- In all my years...

428
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:42,730
...I never killed a famous person.

429
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:45,410
With no witnesses, who'll believe me?

430
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,410
Maybe we can take a picture.

431
00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:51,869
I know! We'll do it like
we did back in the day.

432
00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:56,670
I'll keep your head on a stick
as proof.

433
00:32:58,450 --> 00:32:59,390
My head on a stick?

434
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,440
Well, okay...

435
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,299
...pike.

436
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,940
- You're trying to scare me.
- Is it working?

437
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,640
No.

438
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:12,349
How about now?

439
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:19,430
- You're crazy.
- No. I'm a vampire.

440
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,009
You could drop a few pounds.
I'll help you.

441
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,299
This isn't you.

442
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,380
They always mistake me for the
character, never see the real me.

443
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,730
I just wanted to--

444
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,839
Be like me?
Hey, I'm one happy fella.

445
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,910
I'll torture you
for a few long hours...

446
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:49,289
...then you can tell me
if this is the lifestyle for you.

447
00:33:54,849 --> 00:33:56,079
Up to you.

448
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,590
Whatever you're going to do...

449
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,630
...do it.

450
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,380
I'm not running anymore.

451
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,900
Now, that I respect!

452
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,440
Women!

453
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,920
It's okay.

454
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,219
Thank God!

455
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:03,230
Help me. He's trying to kill me.

456
00:35:03,489 --> 00:35:04,679
You slut!

457
00:35:06,489 --> 00:35:08,559
- You did it with him, didn't you?
- Cordelia.

458
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:11,139
- What are you talking about?
- What you did.

459
00:35:11,889 --> 00:35:14,380
- I didn't do anything.
- You must have done something.

460
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:19,460
Maybe I gave him something
to loosen him up. Now he's--

461
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,829
- Loose?
- Yeah.

462
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,090
- What was it?
- Does it matter?

463
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,420
If he's homicidal, I think, yeah!

464
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:28,400
- Doximall.
- Doximall!

465
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:31,670
- Doxi-what?
- Powerful tranquilizer. Induces bliss.

466
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:34,500
Bliss? As in bliss?

467
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,500
Sheer contentment?
Perfect happiness?

468
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:41,130
- It's synthetic. Not true happiness.
- This is good.

469
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,380
He hasn't really turned.
It's an illusion.

470
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:46,260
He bit me.

471
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:49,570
We'll leave the premises
until the effects wear off.

472
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:52,849
- Are you sure they will wear off?
- Reasonably.

473
00:35:54,489 --> 00:35:56,000
He's cut the power.

474
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:58,960
- Where's the box?
- Side of the building.

475
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:01,039
- He's gone out.
- Which means he's--

476
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:04,250
Looks like somebody
didn't pay the power bill.

477
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:08,949
Cordelia?

478
00:36:09,489 --> 00:36:12,090
I'd lay odds that the phone's
dead too.

479
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,139
What do you think?

480
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,349
- What happens if there's an emergency?
- Angel.

481
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:24,329
I want you to listen to me.
What you're experiencing isn't real.

482
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:27,550
You've been fed a drug.
It's simulating bliss.

483
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,389
All that you're feeling
is chemical suggestion.

484
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,849
Angel?

485
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:42,480
Name's Angelus.

486
00:36:44,889 --> 00:36:48,820
I don't wish to take drastic measures,
but unless you listen, I warn you--

487
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:52,639
You're warning me?
What happened, Wes?

488
00:36:54,489 --> 00:36:56,099
You suddenly grow a pair?

489
00:36:56,889 --> 00:36:59,909
That's it. The whole root
of your inferiority complex.

490
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:05,340
Good news, Wes, old boy. You don't
really have an inferiority complex.

491
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:07,750
You're just simply inferior.

492
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,320
Wesley, no!

493
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,300
- Why don't you just--
- Just-- Just--

494
00:37:20,289 --> 00:37:21,550
Line?!

495
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:25,079
"Of course a time will come...

496
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:29,519
...when Torvald is not
as devoted to me."

497
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:34,289
You were really, let me tell you, bad.

498
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,130
- Stop it.
- Why?

499
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:39,900
You didn't. I've been to hell,
but that was so much worse!

500
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,070
You had to be there.

501
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:47,769
There wasn't a dry eye in the house.
Everybody was laughing.

502
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:51,750
Here's a thought: Maybe you can
get Raven to coach you.

503
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:54,119
Then you'd actually suck.

504
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,150
- Back off.
- What are you gonna do?

505
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,250
- Melt me?
- One more step and you'll find out.

506
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,719
You think this is just water?

507
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,769
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

508
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:12,119
You don't think I was ready
for this, do you?

509
00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:16,000
Why do I have a stake stashed in my
desk, a cross in my bag?

510
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:20,269
I think about this happening
every single day.

511
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,269
That's just drinking water.

512
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,840
Delivered right to our door...

513
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:29,489
...then blessed every second
Tuesday by Father Mackie...

514
00:38:30,489 --> 00:38:33,969
...while you're down in your cave
sleeping through the day.

515
00:38:36,489 --> 00:38:37,750
You don't believe me?

516
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:40,679
Have some!

517
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,510
And the Oscar goes to....

518
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:15,969
Are you still evil?

519
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,960
- I'm so sorry.
- Can you read that line again?

520
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,659
- Rebecca? Is she--?
- Gone.

521
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:33,570
She won't be keeping you on retainer
as her bodyguard.

522
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:37,309
I think it was the trying
to murder her that lost the gig.

523
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,949
- I need to apologize.
- There's no need.

524
00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:44,929
- Hello?
- It was the drug. Couldn't be helped.

525
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:50,090
Things were said, that's true...

526
00:39:50,809 --> 00:39:53,369
...but I think it best if we
put it behind us.

527
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,019
Move on.

528
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,260
Thank you.

529
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:05,269
You walk a fine line, Angel.

530
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,130
I don't envy you.

531
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,940
Wesley?

532
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,909
Nice moves up there.

533
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,380
- Cordelia--
- Okay.

534
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:30,530
Here's something I never
thought I would say to you:

535
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,519
Wesley's right.

536
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,550
- Forget it.
- I didn't mean--

537
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:39,389
Yes, you did. I'd appreciate you
not trying to weasel out of it.

538
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:46,909
Angelus may not be relaxing company,
but at least he's honest.

539
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,750
Shouldn't I expect the same
from the not-evil version?

540
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,889
So we're okay, then?

541
00:40:56,809 --> 00:41:00,320
I'm too big of a person to let it
get in the way of our friendship.

542
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,190
I appreciate that.

543
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:09,429
You're not gonna untie me, are you?

544
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,239
Wesley?

545
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:18,860
Cordelia?

546
00:41:20,409 --> 00:41:21,349
Guys?
