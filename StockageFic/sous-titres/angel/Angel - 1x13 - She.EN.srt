1
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:14,980
Hi, Laura. Diego.

2
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,480
- Let the consumption begin.
- Excellent.

3
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:20,899
- You gonna behave yourself?
- Ever seen me at a party?

4
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:28,739
- Hi, you having fun?
- Sure.

5
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,719
- This is--
- Your idea of hell.

6
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:33,820
In hell you tend to know
a lot of the people.

7
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:36,500
- I'm having a great time.
- Yeah?

8
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,859
- Can I get you some blood?
- I'm good.

9
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:42,429
Steve Paymer came.
Can you believe it?

10
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:45,719
David Paymer's brother? Steve?

11
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,789
Steve!

12
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,250
Sorry. Pardon me.

13
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,790
I need to cool off.
Cordelia sure knows how to throw a do.

14
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,439
These mini-Reubens, with the
little sauerkraut and little Swiss...

15
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,829
...what genius brought these
into the world?

16
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,370
What say a couple of demon hunters
start chatting up the fillies?

17
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,329
- Hey.
- Hey--

18
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:33,930
- Nice sweater. Hand-knit?
- Certainly not by me.

19
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,140
- I meant, it's a great sweater.
- Oh, well, I'll pass that on then.

20
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,909
To the person who knit it.
I mean, I would if I knew who did.

21
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:46,250
But I don't.

22
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,959
So I won't pass it on to anyone,
will I?

23
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,840
Bye.

24
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:01,319
Diego, pants on!

25
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,769
With my master's degree in fine arts,
I launched my own business...

26
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,060
...selling sandwiches downtown
from a little cart.

27
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,189
I do see a lot of stuff on the job.

28
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,280
So I tell myself that I'm
"honing my eye."

29
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:19,250
Makes sense.

30
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,939
Oh, I love this!

31
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,560
Would you like to dance?

32
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,590
I don't dance.

33
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,659
Hi, Dennis.

34
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,689
How you doing?

35
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,039
Still dead?

36
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,930
I know the feeling.

37
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:46,209
Holy God!

38
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,259
Hey.

39
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,300
Good morning. Is there coffee?

40
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:46,540
They're still in bean form.
I thought I ordered the ground.

41
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:50,139
Can you crush them
with your vampire strength?

42
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:52,970
Just mush the bag. Just...

43
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:54,660
...mush them.

44
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:04,750
- Really fun party last night.
- I'm so glad you came.

45
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,000
I worried someone might suck
the energy out of the room...

46
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:12,970
...like a hole of boring despair.
But there you were, in the clinch.

47
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:16,259
I didn't-- Boring?

48
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:19,750
You used to be a person.
Did people not party in olden times?

49
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:22,050
I talked to people.

50
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,980
- Laura.
- She thought you hated her.

51
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:27,839
- I said you were challenged.
- I don't hate her.

52
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:31,930
I got two modes with people,
bite and avoid. Hard to shift.

53
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:35,350
- I can't get too close. With women--
- You can be nice.

54
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:39,480
It's not like Laura's gonna throw
you down and tear off all of your--

55
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:42,800
- Well, actually, Laura--
- I'll try harder.

56
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:46,430
Still, I mean, the quiet,
reserved thing...

57
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,839
...don't you think it makes me cool?

58
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:53,069
- He was cooler.
- Good morning.

59
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,129
- Now I'm depressed.
- I feel rather chipper.

60
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,689
- That was quite the soiree.
- Glad someone enjoyed it.

61
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:03,480
- I enjoyed it.
- A gala event.

62
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,519
In particular, the tiny Reubens
and the shrimp puffs.

63
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:10,500
Any leftovers lying about?
Any abandoned...

64
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,100
...shrimp puffs?

65
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,019
- You're broke, aren't you?
- A man's finances are his business.

66
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,389
- Want a job?
- Oh, yes, please.

67
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,720
I don't have much, but if you help...

68
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,449
...you're entitled to a cut.

69
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:29,350
- I don't know what to say.
- Great! Now we're--

70
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,759
Do I have to take a pay cut?

71
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,060
A team!

72
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:38,990
You won't be disappointed.

73
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,649
There's something in my eye.

74
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,990
Oh, don't go getting all sappy.
Hold me.

75
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,689
- Why don't we just--?
- Hold me!

76
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:52,019
- Hold on!
- Cordelia!

77
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,300
Gross! Oh!

78
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,839
Ew, is all.

79
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,750
- What did you see?
- I don't just see. I feel, okay?

80
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:10,680
- Thank you, Doyle.
- Is someone in trouble?

81
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,029
I'm, uh....

82
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,149
- I'm at the ready.
- You're going to the ice factory...

83
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:18,199
- ...on 5th.
- What are we looking for?

84
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,290
A corpse.

85
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,720
- No access through the tunnels.
- I'm driving then.

86
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,069
I'm coming with you. I intend
to earn my keep. By the way--

87
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:31,509
- There's no dental.
- Right, I'll floss.

88
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:32,779
Let's go.

89
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,509
Hey, be careful.

90
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:38,309
Guy was burned to death. Thing that
did that could still be there.

91
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,019
Did you see it?

92
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:44,029
All I felt was his fear
and the exploding eyeballs.

93
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,529
- Did I mention I hate this gig?
- We'll be in touch.

94
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,009
After you, sir.

95
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,190
Here we are. Jerico Ice Factory.

96
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:17,789
- Boss, why don't I...
- Stay put.

97
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,840
...stay here and wait for you?

98
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:54,279
Captain Inferno, I presume.

99
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:58,549
Close enough. I don't do well
near an open flame.

100
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,399
Only, you didn't burn him, did you?

101
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,559
Who are you?

102
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,860
I'm not a talker.
I let others carry the conversation.

103
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,070
I am good at putting these
through heads, though.

104
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,690
I am called Tay.

105
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:22,269
- I'm not from your dimension.
- I bet.

106
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:25,730
I was sent to stop it.
That is my cause here.

107
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:29,039
- Stop what?
- The Bringer of Chaos.

108
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:34,230
- What is it? Demon?
- More than a mere demon.

109
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:37,159
It is a vessel of pure rage.

110
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:41,889
It's almost destroyed my world,
and now it is loose in yours.

111
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:49,480
- How can I kill it?
- You won't be able to.

112
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:52,059
It's stronger than one man.

113
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,120
If you and your people wish to live,
stay away.

114
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,049
His name was Tay.
Seemed pretty shook up.

115
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,299
Said it brings chaos
and destruction to his world.

116
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,039
"Tay." Could be a Kovitch demon
from the Caucuses.

117
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,159
He's not from our dimension.

118
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,019
- They must come to ours via portals.
- Portals?

119
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,230
There are portals now?
When did they put in portals?

120
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,350
Don't we have enough to do
without burning monsters coming here?

121
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:31,340
We'll figure out what it is, boss.
You can count on it.

122
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,600
Stop kissing butt.
It's not like we get overtime.

123
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,049
- I'm on it.
- I also want to know--

124
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,029
About similar killings lately?

125
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,539
See? On it.

126
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,789
- Where you headed?
- Victim's office. He's in security.

127
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,720
- I'd like to know who hired him.
- Okay.

128
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:27,610
- What are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same.

129
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:33,610
Working for them?
How much do they pay you to hunt us?

130
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,490
I work for myself. I'm looking
for his killer. Hard to forget.

131
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,169
Burned alive. Know anyone
who does that?

132
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,549
Yes?

133
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,789
Where? How soon?

134
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:53,019
We're sorry, your call did
not go through, Please dial again,

135
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:24,089
Angel Investigations,
we help the hopeless.

136
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:26,099
I hate this phone.
Any luck?

137
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:28,740
We're stymied on the demon
but we found...

138
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,970
...four recent similar killings.

139
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:33,509
All guys, all burned
from the inside out.

140
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:35,559
- Did you find it?
- Yeah.

141
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:37,529
- It's a "she."
- A chick that burns?

142
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:39,410
Are you okay?

143
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:42,019
- Did she...?
- Care about me?

144
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:43,779
Did she Carrie you?

145
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,130
Carrie, the movie?

146
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:47,000
I can't hear you. Hello?

147
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:49,890
Must be in a canyon.

148
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,930
- Can you hear me?
- I can hear you now.

149
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:55,559
- Are you back?
- A bored warlock must have made these.

150
00:17:56,569 --> 00:17:58,460
Keep trying to find that demon ray,

151
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,460
There's more to this.
I think he's on a mission.

152
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:02,950
He may be the key,

153
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:07,309
- What does she look like?
- Two ridges running down either cheek.

154
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:11,170
Violet eyes, She seemed intelligent,

155
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:15,049
She was very...attractive,
for a demon.

156
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:19,210
A hottie, huh? I guess she is,
all right. What with the sizzle.

157
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,089
Sizzler?

158
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:22,640
The sizzle factor.

159
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,450
- Angel?
- I can't hear you.

160
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,569
- Angel?
- Cordelia--

161
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,660
- Excuse me, sir. I need your help.
- What?

162
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:17,099
- There's a man who wants to hurt me.
- What man? Where is he?

163
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:19,430
Over there in the black coat.

164
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,549
- Code three in the front gallery.
- Roger,

165
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:33,450
Code three.

166
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,990
Said he had a black jacket.

167
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,640
Excuse me, ma'am.

168
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,740
And this brings us to
Manet's incomparable...

169
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,039
...la Musique aux Tuileries,
First exhibited in 1863.

170
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:27,859
On the left, one spies
the painter himself.

171
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:32,549
In the distance is Manet's friend,
French poet and critic Baudelaire.

172
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:36,690
Interesting fellow.
In his poem, "Le Vampire," he wrote:

173
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:43,180
Thou who abruptly as a knife
Didst come into my heart

174
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:48,579
He strongly believed that evil forces
surrounded mankind...

175
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:53,059
...and some speculate that the poem
was about a real vampire.

176
00:20:57,809 --> 00:21:01,880
Baudelaire was actually taller
and drunker than he's depicted here.

177
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:05,829
Aha!

178
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,569
Better be an "Aha!" of triumph.

179
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,940
I was dreaming there was a sale
at Neiman's.

180
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,710
I think I've located them,
the "Vigories of Oden Tal."

181
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:18,150
- The what?
- Oden Tal. Vigories.

182
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,920
"They have four ridges on their
foreheads, are fierce warriors...

183
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,799
- ...and the women live enslaved."
- Way to go, Wes!

184
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:29,819
Angel said Tay was the key.
Any way to find him here in town?

185
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,799
"The men are herbivores.
They eat stew made of rotten plants...

186
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:38,299
...and must consume
half their body weight a day."

187
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,359
Whoa.

188
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:43,450
So, we're looking for the
biggest compost heap in L.A.?

189
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,549
You. How?

190
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:54,210
- A human would have been unconscious.
- Answer my questions first.

191
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:58,309
- You're a vampire.
- Among other things.

192
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,710
- What's Tay want?
- I don't have time.

193
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:04,700
- Who killed the guy at the factory?
- You don't think I'll hurt you?

194
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,470
Gotta risk it. I can't allow
tourists to go torching locals.

195
00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:11,480
- Leave. I'm warning you!
- What's gonna happen?

196
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,569
Stay back!

197
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,730
We must go.

198
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:45,250
- What's wrong?
- It's not your concern.

199
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:48,880
- You're not one of us.
- No, but I'll stick around anyway.

200
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,559
It's right, this is not your concern.

201
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,059
The traitor, it, and the other
are ours.

202
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,500
- It's best not to--
- Do that?

203
00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:21,529
- What will happen to her?
- She will be unmade.

204
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:29,720
Please, please! You don't
have to do this to me!

205
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,160
Watch its hands.

206
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,259
I'll be good, I promise.
You don't have to do this to me.

207
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:41,690
Why does it speak when no one listens?

208
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,210
Please!

209
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,880
- It has been recovered.
- Let me go!

210
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:59,259
- It will now be restored.
- You bastards!

211
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:06,569
You'll feel so much better after this.

212
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,890
No!

213
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,369
You should dress that.

214
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:41,390
Your wound.

215
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:46,750
Why do this?
I thought vampires were killers.

216
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:49,359
They are. I was cursed by gypsies.

217
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:52,460
- Cursed to help people?
- Yeah.

218
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:56,029
Gypsies have a strange
sense of...humor.

219
00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:14,950
Want to tell me what's going on?

220
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:22,809
The girl is a runaway. I was trying
to help her escape from our homeland.

221
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,220
If you hadn't--

222
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,109
If I hadn't helped,
you'd both be with them now.

223
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:30,160
Perhaps.

224
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,450
Why was the girl running away?

225
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,809
- She was going to be unmade.
- They'd kill her?

226
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,140
In a fashion you wouldn't understand.

227
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:45,940
Try me.

228
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,460
In Oden Tal...

229
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,859
...what you call personality,
our passions...

230
00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:00,789
...these impulses sit in an area
of the body we call the Ko.

231
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:16,180
Your pursuers want to
take this from you?

232
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,750
From the women, yes.

233
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:24,859
Once females come of age, Ko controls
our physical and sexual power.

234
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:30,259
It even signals when we're aroused
and have met desirable mates.

235
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,009
- When it's removed--
- You're easily controlled.

236
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:43,809
We marry who they command
and serve without questioning.

237
00:26:46,089 --> 00:26:49,210
- We leave behind dreaming.
- But you escaped.

238
00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:53,549
I was the first. I am Jhiera.

239
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,779
Jhiera of Oden Tal.

240
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,490
My family rules the dimension.

241
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,329
I bet they're not loving...

242
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:08,380
...your portal jumping,
refugee-aiding duties.

243
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,329
They tell the people I'm dead,
but the women know.

244
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:22,390
Here, we have a name, a chance
to become. But it's difficult.

245
00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:26,799
When the Ko first matures,
the girls can't manage it...

246
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,029
...our physical energy.

247
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:33,509
We come to your world in a fever.

248
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,150
That's why...the ice.

249
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,769
Yes.

250
00:27:40,089 --> 00:27:43,069
When I first arrived, alone...

251
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,990
...I thought I would die
from the heat under my skin.

252
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:54,549
And your people...

253
00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:57,549
...the men.

254
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:01,180
Some respond to the Ko involuntarily.

255
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,900
They try to force themselves.
It wasn't safe.

256
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,940
Until I found the frozen water.

257
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,099
As long as I could stay cool...

258
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,450
...the worst of it passed
in a few months' time.

259
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,859
Then I started to learn
to control my power.

260
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,579
Like last night when you burned me.

261
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:29,309
I wanted to hurt you.
I thought you were my enemy.

262
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:34,000
- Who burned the guard?
- He tried to touch one of my girls.

263
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:38,019
- He probably didn't mean to hurt her.
- She couldn't help killing him.

264
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,509
What about the other four guys who
died the same way in the last year?

265
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:45,690
- Have you been--?
- No, I haven't been following you.

266
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,650
If you burn people,
there'll be questions.

267
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:51,650
I understand what you're doing,
and I'll help...

268
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,509
...but you can't hurt men
in my world.

269
00:28:55,089 --> 00:28:56,880
I am daughter to a king, sir.

270
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,279
The king who promised
a better life for everyone.

271
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,259
I didn't denounce him and escape
for my good alone.

272
00:29:04,089 --> 00:29:07,210
I did it to fulfill his promise
for all the women of Oden Tal.

273
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:10,359
If a few die to protect my people--

274
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,690
They're my people and I protect them.

275
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:15,829
Then tell them to stay out of my way.

276
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,150
Wait.

277
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:33,690
You too. I don't need your help.

278
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,319
I'm not sure about coming
out here by ourselves.

279
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,579
We should've waited for Angel.

280
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:52,940
As his employee, I feel it's important
to show initiative and drive.

281
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:56,859
We can't just dally about--
Look! Nancy's Petticoat.

282
00:29:58,569 --> 00:30:01,619
They're quite rare. Named for
Nancy Mitford, the author...

283
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,589
...because of her love for--
Right.

284
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,430
- Shoving off.
- I wonder where they keep the compost?

285
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:11,400
I'd say we follow our noses.

286
00:30:12,369 --> 00:30:13,279
Wait!

287
00:30:16,569 --> 00:30:19,829
Wait, okay? We shouldn't have
come here. Smells like flower poop.

288
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:24,180
The portal will open soon,
and only for a short while.

289
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:28,690
When the proper coordinates align,
we must move to the entry point.

290
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:32,819
You will escort it there,
ensure its quick return...

291
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:34,700
...and then rejoin us.

292
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:37,339
We have a lot of work to do here.

293
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,819
It can go home now.

294
00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:41,940
Would it like that?

295
00:30:43,569 --> 00:30:47,049
- Would it like to go home?
- It is happy to go...

296
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:49,380
...as soon as you say.

297
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:52,559
And don't you feel better now?

298
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:06,279
- We've recovered two this month.
- It means nothing.

299
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:10,170
This won't stop until we find Jhiera.

300
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:43,460
Jhiera! Just when I need
the artistic eye of a goddess.

301
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,509
Where are the girls?

302
00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:48,220
And namaste to you.
Where you left them.

303
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,779
You okay? You look spun.

304
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,660
- How are they doing?
- They're chilling.

305
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:13,180
The little sisters are fine.
REM-ing.

306
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,119
Tell me what's up.

307
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,779
- They took the girl.
- Man, that's lame.

308
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:23,940
They will find us before too long.
We must go from here.

309
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,839
The girls aren't ready.
They need isolation...

310
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,500
...and temperature adjustment
before they can go out.

311
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:34,630
- We'll move them someplace else.
- My shaman has a place in the desert.

312
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:38,299
He can't turn away scantily
clad women, from any dimension.

313
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,400
You need work on your mirth chakra.

314
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:45,650
- If we can trust him, we'll go.
- He's good people.

315
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:47,210
Then call him.

316
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,539
If he accepts us, we'll leave
first thing in the morning.

317
00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:10,349
- Still no answer.
- I bet he forgot to turn it on again.

318
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:14,829
You'd think a guy who can use a
Scythian bow could use a cell phone.

319
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,970
- So, what now?
- We head back and find Angel.

320
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:26,019
Great. Lead the way.
Low and slow.

321
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,509
Hide, hide, hide.

322
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,519
Sir!

323
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:34,390
- We've found them.
- Where?

324
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:39,819
An ice worker says he's been shipping
two tons of ice weekly to this place.

325
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:45,220
Gather the men. Prepare them to
capture the princess and cut them all.

326
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:55,180
What are you doing?
We nearly got burned...

327
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,299
...and you're here showering?

328
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:00,009
- Hello?
- She's especially agitated...

329
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,839
...because we tried calling
during a situation.

330
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,059
I had to take a shower.

331
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:10,809
- What's up?
- The demons said they found someone.

332
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,849
And they said they would
cut the "princess"...

333
00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:16,849
...which I imagine is
not a happy thing.

334
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:20,449
You'd be right on that one.
We gotta find her first.

335
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:24,360
The demon said something about a lot
of ice being delivered somewhere.

336
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:27,150
- Ice?
- Yeah.

337
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:33,329
- Shipping order address. Let's go.
- That's it?

338
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,130
They seemed....

339
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,519
There were a lot of them.
We need a plan.

340
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:42,539
We go in, I hit people hard
in the face. See where it takes us.

341
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:00,969
Wait here. I want a warning.

342
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:02,670
All right?

343
00:35:05,289 --> 00:35:06,449
Wesley!

344
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,489
- Welcome!
- Where's Jhiera?

345
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:26,210
Sorry, no Jhiera here.
But I see I can help you.

346
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:29,239
- Let's start with the clothes.
- She's in trouble.

347
00:35:29,889 --> 00:35:32,420
- Men are coming for her.
- Where are you from?

348
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:34,469
You don't want to know.

349
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,480
You? I thought I made it clear.

350
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,260
- They're coming.
- We're leaving tomorrow.

351
00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:46,219
Not soon enough.

352
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,510
- They're coming.
- That would be now.

353
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:51,619
Help get the girls out.

354
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,559
Stall them as long as you can.

355
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,159
I'm helping you
whether you like it or not.

356
00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:03,400
Oh, my. You're--
Allow me to introduce myself.

357
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,769
Wesley!

358
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,230
How about a clay massage?
We heal, brothers.

359
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:46,099
- That outfit quite becomes you.
- Wesley, get a grip.

360
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:49,000
They can't hold them off long.

361
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,510
My, what a grip. Very healthy.

362
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:55,489
Surprisingly firm myself.

363
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,400
- Feel.
- You're pathetic...

364
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,010
- ...and about to get fried!
- No, but...

365
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,519
...just one kiss goodbye?

366
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,570
- Jhiera and the runaways are ours.
- No.

367
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,690
Give them back or the humans die.

368
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:38,800
Then they die.

369
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,260
Hold it!

370
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,409
Hold it still.

371
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,519
Time to go home.

372
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,309
Let her go or your leader's dead.

373
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:28,110
Go. Go!

374
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,900
- Don't bring your war here.
- I have to.

375
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,869
If this enemy persists,
our society crumbles.

376
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:54,889
- Here, you'll have another enemy.
- You don't understand, human.

377
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,909
No, I don't.

378
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,289
And I'm not human.

379
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,429
If I were you, I'd grab
the next portal out.

380
00:39:31,889 --> 00:39:32,900
Sorry.

381
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,809
- I had a--
- Mushing didn't work?

382
00:39:35,489 --> 00:39:37,309
Not to worry. My fault, I'm sure.

383
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:40,280
Really. Cagey little brutes,
aren't they?

384
00:39:40,889 --> 00:39:43,239
I'll wash them individually.
They'll be like new.

385
00:39:43,889 --> 00:39:44,829
- Better.
- Stop.

386
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,690
You groveling isn't just
a way of life, it's an art.

387
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:51,250
I don't grovel. Don't fire me.
Yesterday was an anomaly.

388
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:55,590
- I'm rarely taken hostage.
- Good, and you're not fired.

389
00:39:55,889 --> 00:39:57,539
- I'm not?
- It wasn't your fault.

390
00:39:58,289 --> 00:40:01,909
- You handled yourself very well.
- That's-- I can't tell you how--

391
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,670
- I'm your faithful servant, Angel.
- Like I said, an art.

392
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,440
Look who's here.
Can I get you something?

393
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:14,050
A knife to our throat?
You can run away?

394
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,349
Come on in.

395
00:40:35,489 --> 00:40:38,019
The girls are safe, outside the city.

396
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:41,650
Good, but you nearly got
Cordelia and Wesley killed.

397
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,369
- I had no choice.
- Protecting the innocent...

398
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,230
...shouldn't depend
on where they're from.

399
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:51,710
An easy sentiment when
your people are free.

400
00:40:52,289 --> 00:40:54,179
I'm not saying you shouldn't fight.

401
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:58,340
Just know that I'll stop you
if you cross the line.

402
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:03,110
I don't need an extra conscience.
I'll do what I think is right.

403
00:41:04,889 --> 00:41:06,500
And I'll do the same.

404
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,289
Fine. I think we understand
each other then.

405
00:41:19,889 --> 00:41:21,150
I have to go.
