1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:03,399
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:05,019
Landok? Is that you?

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,129
- The two of you are--
- Cousins.

4
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:10,060
Fred disappeared
and was never found.

5
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:15,419
The vision. This book. We can send
him back. The portal works both ways.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,120
Cordelia!

7
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:19,870
Cordy's in the Host's dimension now.

8
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:23,539
They have no music there.
She's in a bad place.

9
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,070
They use you as a slave
till you give.

10
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:28,910
- Fugitive!
- No!

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,520
- I'm not on fire?
- It is another dimension.

12
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,079
My cow is cursed!

13
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:43,090
I don't know about any curse.
I just have these visions.

14
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,359
She has the Sight.

15
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:46,909
For your crime...

16
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,780
...you'll be jailed until our
Royal Highness sentences you.

17
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:52,490
One...

18
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:55,350
...two...

19
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,789
...three!

20
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:06,060
Hi, guys.

21
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,459
Cordelia?

22
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:12,950
No way!

23
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,939
You're safe.

24
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,120
A little bit.
They made me ruler.

25
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,620
- But this is fantastic!
- Well...

26
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,329
...my throne could use a
few extra cushions.

27
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:31,819
But I'm really not going to complain.

28
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:34,150
You can order them to release us.

29
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,939
- I can.
- Shall we gut them now, so you...

30
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:39,799
...can eat them, Most High?

31
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,450
You're most high for thinking that.

32
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:46,260
Besides, shouldn't there be
some groveling first?

33
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:48,379
Cordelia.

34
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,799
Okay.
Off with their heads!

35
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:55,829
Kidding!

36
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,789
Your Majesty, I must protest.

37
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,250
Freeing criminals in your presence?

38
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,740
You're gonna make me use
my important voice, aren't you?

39
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:02,219
Leave us!

40
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,439
- Thank God!
- Yes!

41
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,750
Food! I thought we'd
never see food again.

42
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,560
What happened?

43
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:25,500
They jabbed me with
hot pokers for a while...

44
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,800
...then made me princess!

45
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,590
It doesn't make sense.

46
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:34,889
In a world where humans are slaves,
why would they make one monarch?

47
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,389
- You had a vision, didn't you?
- Yeah.

48
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,199
Can I just say: visions,
not getting any easier.

49
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:44,219
I'm still vibrating.

50
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,139
- That could be from the pokers.
- See?

51
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,389
- A vision. That explains it.
- It does?

52
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,129
- Well, see, there's this prophecy.
- Great.

53
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:56,740
Those always go well.

54
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,900
The priests that have been in charge,
the Covenant of Trombli--

55
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,189
Anyway, they teach
of a coming messiah:

56
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,020
The Cursed One.
A being with the Pure Sight...

57
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,020
...who will restore the monarchy.

58
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:16,110
- Pure sight?
- A direct link to The Powers That Be.

59
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:17,750
I mean her.

60
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,990
- She's the messiah?
- It could happen.

61
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,060
It has.
That's what the Trombli believe.

62
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,269
We might stand a chance of surviving
long enough to find a way out.

63
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:35,459
- How did you get in?
- Via portal, with the book.

64
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,639
We seem to have misplaced it.

65
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,600
- The portal or the book?
- Both.

66
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,459
They've got books here.

67
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:48,339
Those Trombonal guys,
they used some when they swore me in.

68
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:51,199
I've got to see those.

69
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,970
To get back to the "Cordelia
isn't a princess" dimension?

70
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:58,930
Don't we still need an
inter-dimensional hot spot?

71
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:01,370
Yes, that's true.

72
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,449
Angel....

73
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,930
He's reflecting!

74
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,149
The metaphysical laws which govern
our world don't apply here.

75
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:16,329
- He can walk in the sun too.
- Okay.

76
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:22,220
- This is from entering the portal?
- No. It always looks like that.

77
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,810
Angel, while we find the proper
incantation, go with the Host.

78
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,199
See if you can document
any portal activity.

79
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,410
- I don't get it.
- Well, we need to ascertain--

80
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,899
No, I mean why didn't anybody
tell me about this?

81
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,939
You look good.

82
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,040
- You're not just saying that?
- Angel, please. Go with the Host.

83
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:50,250
Track down Landok.
Speak to his family--

84
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:52,370
Back up. Back up.

85
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,819
You want me to talk to my family?
On purpose?

86
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:02,519
It's that, or face never returning
to our own dimension again.

87
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,970
Come. Stare at yourself
in my grandmother's glass eye.

88
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,470
Call me Lorne. In Pylea, a "host"
is one more thing to lay your eggs in.

89
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,879
Yeah, fine.
Hey, can we get my coat?

90
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,920
The books. Can we get access?

91
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,040
Am I not the princess?

92
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,160
Letting her wear the crown
is a sacrilege.

93
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:27,110
She is cursed. She has the Sight.
We all agree.

94
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:31,939
Not all. Why would The Powers
choose this craven beast?

95
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,610
It doesn't matter.

96
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:40,160
She's our sovereign and must not be
harmed. Not until after the com-shuk.

97
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:43,170
If the princess survives
the com-shuk...

98
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:48,139
...then you may have
her head, Barshon. But not before.

99
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,259
Boy, I'd give my left horn
to not have to do this.

100
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:06,430
Hi-dee-ho!

101
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:10,879
Guess who's back.

102
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:14,509
Krevlornswath?

103
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:18,610
Can it be true?

104
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:22,519
I've prayed that I might
see you aga;n.

105
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:24,360
You're in luck then.

106
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:31,230
- You've shamed and betrayed our clan.
- Thanks, Mom.

107
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:36,310
Each morning before I feed, I go out
into the hills where it's parched...

108
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,149
...beat my breast and curse the birth
of such a cretinous boy!

109
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:43,420
My mother!

110
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:46,769
Your father was right.
We ate the wrong son.

111
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,180
Enough of this reminiscing.
A few questions, then I'll go.

112
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:54,500
Remember five years ago,
when I disappeared?

113
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,089
Did you notice anything odd?

114
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:58,839
Feasting and celebration.

115
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,089
Your brother Numfar
did the Dance of Joy.

116
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,470
Numfar! Do the Dance of Joy.

117
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:09,350
Actually, what I meant was
more like strange flashing...

118
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,079
...kind of a weird pulsating--

119
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:17,009
They don't have music here. I wish
it was the same for dancing.

120
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,180
Lights. You couldn't have missed it.
Big, bendy, swirly--

121
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,540
Stop doing the Dance of Joy, Numfar!

122
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:26,199
Nothing like that at all?

123
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,839
Take your cow and get off my lawn.

124
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:31,139
That's no cow.

125
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:34,139
My friend.
It's good to see you again.

126
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,909
I'd have died in your world,
were it not for you.

127
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,490
You know Krevlornswath's cow?

128
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:43,799
- He's Angel, the brave Drokken killer.
- Just Angel....

129
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,120
He's a valiant and courageous warrior.

130
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,519
We shall welcome and honor him.

131
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:53,190
- Numfar, do the Dance of Honor!
- Landok, hi...

132
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:57,110
...we have a few portal queries,
and then we'll--

133
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,720
We shall adorn him like a warrior...

134
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,809
- ...so all may know of his valor.
- No wire hanger. That's leather!

135
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:08,080
Guys. You know, this really isn't....

136
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,360
Nice!

137
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,179
You'll be guest of honor at the feast.

138
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,940
There, you'll tell of your bravery
against the vicious Drokken.

139
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,779
Now, about the hair.
Do you think that...?

140
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:29,190
Why, it's the homecoming
I always dreamed of.

141
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:36,720
Can you actually read this stuff?

142
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:40,700
It resembles some
demonic languages with which I'm...

143
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,149
...familiar, but...

144
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,649
...whole passages are missing.

145
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,049
Fascinating. A hart.

146
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,990
It's not a heart, it's Bambi.
We expect him to read this tiny print?

147
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:04,029
No, not H-E-A-R-T, H-A-R-T.
A male red deer or staggard...

148
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:06,539
...often linked with mysticism.

149
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:10,629
They all got animals on them.
Probably demon bedtime stories.

150
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,149
Of course! The holy books
are written in trionic.

151
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:16,850
What?

152
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,940
No one volume is complete
without the other two.

153
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,980
It's one book broken up
into three pieces.

154
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:26,730
- Like a trilogy.
- No.

155
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,799
Much more complex than that.
See this passage?

156
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,799
It continues in this volume, here...

157
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,799
...then concludes in this one.

158
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:40,100
The sentence structure indicates
when to go from book to book.

159
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:41,659
Any portals?

160
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,169
I'm not sure.
It takes time to decipher.

161
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,620
Starting to bore the princess.

162
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,570
But I am finding references
to The Cursed One.

163
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:55,559
Really?
There's stuff about Messiah Me?

164
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,500
"Com-shuk"....

165
00:10:58,649 --> 00:10:59,519
Huh?

166
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,379
Contextually, a verb.

167
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,919
- Something I'm going to do?
- With a Groosalugg.

168
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:09,929
- What does that mean?
- I have no idea.

169
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:12,679
- Sounds dirty.
- Nobody asked you.

170
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:15,299
Let's just ask somebody
what it means.

171
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:17,240
Like who?

172
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,919
One of them priests.
These belong to them.

173
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,690
Yeah.

174
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,940
Look, you're the princess.

175
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,429
- Can't you make them translate it?
- I guess I could.

176
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:30,440
Yeah! Why not?

177
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,940
Princess not taking a vote, is she?

178
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:36,190
I'll make a decree.

179
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,860
Wolf.

180
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:42,190
Ram.

181
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,610
And Hart.

182
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:51,440
I'm not sure the priests
can be trusted.

183
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,990
--the scroll was just tipping
from his fingertips.

184
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,970
And his eyes--
The fighting was fierce!

185
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,019
I chopped off the evil
lawyer-beast's hand, and he screamed...

186
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,809
...and then I left.

187
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,110
You're a regular
Hans Christian Tarantino.

188
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,549
We should get back to the palace.

189
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,259
I hate to disappoint the kids.
They enjoy it.

190
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:36,350
Nice to be a hero without the
moral ambiguities like back home?

191
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,639
Yeah. Maybe it is, a little.

192
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,059
You start to see yourself
the way they do.

193
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,029
You become that image. I get it.
I know how they see me. Can we go?

194
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:49,519
Just one more--

195
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,679
Tell us again of the sorcerer
who could remove his limbs at will.

196
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:56,190
Right, because that's a good one.

197
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,460
It is time for the Bach-nal.

198
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,009
- Angel, you shall swing the crebbil.
- Yeah? Okay.

199
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,500
The crebbil?
Angel, Angel, Angel....

200
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,980
- Cordelia, you must listen to me.
- No, I think I've heard enough.

201
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:19,179
You want me to go back where
we'd be slaves? Sorry, not good.

202
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,980
There are forces at work here.

203
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,210
You don't know who these priests are
or what they serve.

204
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:28,049
Look, you can go.

205
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:30,620
But I must stay here
and be a princess.

206
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:35,269
- And com-shuk with a Groosalugg.
- Better than shoveling horse poo.

207
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:38,210
Majesty.

208
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,450
You all right?

209
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:44,070
- Yeah.
- No.

210
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,070
Priesty, what's with this Groosalugg?

211
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:50,840
- What's that about?
- You had a vision, Majesty?

212
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:53,500
Yes.

213
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:57,409
Yes, she has had a vision.

214
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:00,059
So you may as well
be candid with her...

215
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,129
...or she'll know.

216
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:05,279
No lying to the messiah.

217
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,389
Clearly, Majesty has seen
the Groosalugg.

218
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:11,179
It was summoned from the Scum Pits.

219
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:13,129
Scum Pits?

220
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:17,129
- It'll arrive before nightfall.
- So the really close Scum Pits.

221
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:21,720
Everyone is very anxious
for Her Majesty to com-shuk with it.

222
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,149
Of course.
Why wouldn't they be?

223
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:29,730
These two, they didn't know what
the com-shuk was. You tell them.

224
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,940
The com-shuk is a mating ritual.

225
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,269
I told you it was dirty.

226
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:37,720
Yes!

227
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:42,470
Exactly. The mating ritual.
Which is great.

228
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:48,049
It's been a really long time
since I've had a good com-shuk.

229
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:50,500
So, um....

230
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:53,350
I'm just gonna run out
for a minute...

231
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:56,950
...because I wanted to get it a gift.
And you know...

232
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:01,990
...Groosaluggs are hard to buy for.
So I should hurry.

233
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:05,350
You mustn't leave
the palace, Majesty.

234
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:09,019
The rebels are out.
There are rumblings.

235
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:11,330
Rebel rumblings?

236
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,889
- We've doubled the palace guard.
- Doubled?

237
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:19,360
- Tell me when the Groosalugg is here.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

238
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,950
Okay. Well, then you can go.

239
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:26,779
Thank you, Your Majesty.

240
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:34,649
Let's get the hell out of here.

241
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:45,340
- Swing the crebbil!
- Swing the crebbil!

242
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:47,960
Swing the crebbil!

243
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:49,399
Angel....

244
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,340
Angel!

245
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,629
Swing the crebbil!

246
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:08,919
Swing the crebbil!

247
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:12,620
Strike quickly and true.
Then we can eat.

248
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:23,240
Swing the crebbil!

249
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:27,710
- You expect me to--
- Sever the cow's head!

250
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,519
Make it quick, make it quick,
make it quick.

251
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,909
It is a great honor
to swing the crebbil.

252
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,539
What is he doing?

253
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:42,990
- You want me to kill her?
- The cow's a runaway!

254
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,559
It sneaks down and plunders
our food stores.

255
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,399
- She was probably hungry.
- You won't swing the crebbil?

256
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:55,669
Only if you force me to.

257
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,679
Here we go.

258
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,799
We'll back up slowly,
and these good folks are gonna...

259
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,340
- Stop them!
- ...kill us!

260
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:08,910
Stop...

261
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,630
...in the name of love

262
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,910
Before you break my heart

263
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:20,259
For, baby, I'm aware

264
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,269
What strange sorcery is this?

265
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:27,519
Each time you leave my door

266
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:31,759
It burns! It burns!

267
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,480
Knowing you're all the love
You'll meet

268
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:38,970
Come on!

269
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,039
Think it--
Oh, shit!

270
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,160
Okay.

271
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:52,769
Hurry up!

272
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,309
If we ever get out of here...

273
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:59,500
...find me a dimension where demons
don't want to impregnate me.

274
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:02,720
Is it too much to ask?
What is it about me?

275
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,930
Do I put out a com-shuk-me vibe?

276
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:07,869
I mean, you'd tell me, right?

277
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,640
Okay, smells like I'll be mating
with the Groosalugg.

278
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,710
You can do this.

279
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,980
The sewage system
is our only sure bet.

280
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,720
- Just hold your breath.
- Why can't we use the front door?

281
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,869
- Your booty getting through the door?
- Hey.

282
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,160
- That booty.
- Oh.

283
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:35,190
I wanted something to remember
my reign by. Is that so wrong?

284
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,349
- Oh, God.
- Here you go.

285
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,400
You first.

286
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,960
We've been looking for Your Majesty.

287
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,190
The servants must have left
that door open.

288
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,390
Yeah.

289
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:06,710
It's kind of whiffy in here.

290
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:16,130
I just thought I would have
this stuff appraised.

291
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:19,000
Your Majesty,
the Groosalugg approaches.

292
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:22,740
Oh, good.

293
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:34,309
- She didn't make it.
- Now what?

294
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,369
We find Angel.

295
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,150
I don't think we've been followed.

296
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:55,430
We should probably stay on foot,
in case they try to track us down.

297
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:01,369
You okay?

298
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,390
Handsome man saved me
from the monsters.

299
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:12,950
Bye.

300
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,339
Hey! Wait a minute!

301
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,019
Hello?

302
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,130
Great place.

303
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,420
You don't have to
be afraid of me, really.

304
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,660
You know I'd never...

305
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,440
...hurt you.

306
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:25,829
So....

307
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:30,619
- So you don't want to talk to me?
- Yeah.

308
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:33,809
Why won't you?

309
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:34,759
Because...

310
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:39,410
...you're not real. Or I'm not real.

311
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,230
Somebody here isn't real.
I think it's you.

312
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,910
If you're not real, then it means
my head was chopped off. I'm dead now.

313
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,720
Dead. And with me being dead
and you being not real...

314
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:55,829
...I can't have
a conversation with you.

315
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,549
It's just too much, all right?

316
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:01,119
Okay.

317
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,680
What's that you're doing?

318
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:11,779
I think I saw it in a dream.

319
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,380
You've been here a long time.

320
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:18,519
Always.... Not always.

321
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,430
I had a dream that I had a name.

322
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:26,180
"Winifred."

323
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,240
- You're the girl in Cordy's vision.
- What?

324
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:34,869
"Fred."

325
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:38,599
- You were studying to be a physicist.
- That's my dream.

326
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:41,569
You vanished in Los Angeles
5 years ago.

327
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:43,339
Stop it.

328
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:45,839
- It's not a dream.
- It's not?

329
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,359
No.

330
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:51,380
- And my head's still on?
- Yeah.

331
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,970
You're real?

332
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:56,960
No.

333
00:22:57,289 --> 00:22:59,710
- No, I don't want you to be real.
- Why?

334
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:03,619
Because you're nice and
you saved me.

335
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,680
Bad things will happen to you here.
They always do.

336
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:10,650
No, nothing bad will happen.
It'll be okay.

337
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,910
- We'll take you out of here.
- We?

338
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,769
- Me and my friends are going back.
- No, can't get back. There's no back.

339
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,079
We'll open a portal--

340
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:22,339
- The portal. She fell through it.
- Who?

341
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:25,259
That other girl.
I couldn't save her.

342
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,259
- They've got her. She'll die!
- Cordy?

343
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:32,500
- She's fine. They made her princess.
- They--

344
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:34,759
Really?

345
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:42,339
When I got here, they--
They didn't do that.

346
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,579
Well, that's nice for her.

347
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:52,390
I'm wearing this for a first date?

348
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:57,359
I don't want to seem too easy.
I was thinking a nice tailored suit...

349
00:23:58,369 --> 00:23:59,599
...of armor.

350
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:04,670
I figured we'd start slow. A few
dinners, some light conversation...

351
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:09,750
...then, in three or four years,
if we're still hitting it off--

352
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:11,839
- Your Majesty.
- Yeah?

353
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,569
The Groosalugg.

354
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:19,740
You think it would add some feminine
mystery if I were to not be here?

355
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,019
Kill me now.

356
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,130
Just put those anywhere.

357
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,829
Majesty.

358
00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:50,839
I've never been to the palace.

359
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:55,180
I've seen it up there,
on that hill, watching me.

360
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,930
We've just got to find my friends.

361
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:03,509
Get down!

362
00:25:08,569 --> 00:25:11,480
You may see something scary,
but I'm your friend.

363
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:47,250
Bad things always happen here.

364
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,619
An animal...

365
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,539
...a beast. To my people,
I was nothing more than this.

366
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,009
Why?

367
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:28,069
- Can you not see why?
- Not exactly. You seem good to me.

368
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,099
You are truly beneficent.
Such compassion...

369
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:36,970
...to ignore the flaws
of my polluted birth.

370
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,470
Well-- Huh?

371
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,440
The strange curve of my mouth.

372
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:51,420
The odd bulging of my limbs.

373
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:56,430
The heart beating in the wrong place.

374
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:01,769
As I matured, these defects
became more apparent.

375
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,819
The Covenant soon determined
there could be no mistake.

376
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,829
There was cow's blood in my veins.

377
00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:11,200
So?

378
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,950
Heck, I'm all cow-- Human.

379
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:18,490
No, no, no. You are beyond
cow or god. You...

380
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:21,319
...you are the transcendent one.

381
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,740
I am?

382
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,680
You're cursed by The Powers.

383
00:27:25,289 --> 00:27:27,539
- Tell me about it.
- For my people...

384
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:31,839
...to be part cow is to be less.
I couldn't prove my worth.

385
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:36,700
I was incapable even
of performing husbandly duties...

386
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:38,940
...with my tribe's females.

387
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,460
- You're--
- Equipped to mate only with a human.

388
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,359
- Good to know.
- I was cast from my village...

389
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:49,240
...cut off from my life-givers,
forced to make it on my own.

390
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:54,809
My parents were busted for tax fraud.
My trust fund dried up.

391
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,240
I sought to end my suffering.

392
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,609
Get out.

393
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,309
No. Wait!

394
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:11,480
He can stay.

395
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:16,069
Go on.

396
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:18,819
You sought to end your suffering.

397
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:21,819
I entered every contest
of skill and daring...

398
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:25,519
...in an attempt to snuff out
my pathetic life.

399
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,289
But, even at this, I failed.

400
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,450
You did?

401
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:33,250
I won every match.
I vanquished every Flame Beast.

402
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,950
I defeated every Drokken.

403
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:40,740
Nothing could stop me.

404
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:46,019
The Covenant had no choice but to
bestow upon me the name Groosalugg...

405
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,740
...the brave and undefeated.

406
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,240
Wow!

407
00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:57,890
- Majesty.
- What?

408
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,920
There was trouble
at the Bach-nal.

409
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:04,549
The prisoner is ready
for your cruel punishment.

410
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:07,519
Handle it, will you?
I'm busy.

411
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,559
Execute the prisoner.

412
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:13,099
Wait!

413
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,099
Hang on!

414
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:18,039
Pardon him! I pardon him!

415
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:20,369
Pardon him.

416
00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:22,420
Release him now!

417
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,680
Oh, baby.

418
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:26,970
Are you okay?

419
00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:31,130
Not as good as you, obviously.

420
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,420
Do you want to borrow their cuffs?

421
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,440
Listen, I'll get right back to you.

422
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:40,559
You're pardoned. Shoo!

423
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:44,650
- Where's Wesley and Gunn?
- I'm sure they're fine.

424
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,579
- We're lost.
- Nonsense.

425
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:51,609
Follow the sun. We'll head
towards the village.

426
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:54,119
- Which one?
- Which village?

427
00:29:54,769 --> 00:29:58,980
Which sun? There are two of them.
Alternate dimension. We're lost.

428
00:29:59,569 --> 00:30:02,829
You having a Blair Witch moment?

429
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:05,519
Something's hunting us.

430
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,940
- Palace guards?
- I don't know.

431
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,150
What the hell is it?

432
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:29,140
Move! Move!

433
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:30,579
Move!

434
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:32,839
It's Angel!

435
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:38,450
Angel! Can you hear me?

436
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:40,680
Angel?

437
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:22,779
You're hurt.

438
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,819
What just happened?

439
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,849
That strange wild girl
saved us from Angel.

440
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:32,519
Something very freaky
is going on here.

441
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,470
I may know what.

442
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:40,140
Angel's vampire self has been
sublimated somehow by this dimension.

443
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,579
It's okay.

444
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:47,089
- Only his human side has surfaced.
- Being in the sun...

445
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:49,529
- ...seeing his reflection.
- Yes.

446
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:52,430
Now somehow he's accessed
his demon...

447
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:55,359
...but he can't find the balance.

448
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,599
His demon self has overcome
his human side.

449
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:02,690
That's what the thing inside
of him looks like?

450
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,819
In its purest form.

451
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,930
It's nasty.

452
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,859
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

453
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:12,019
We've got to help him.

454
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:18,690
- All right?
- Yeah.

455
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:33,470
Oh, good. More fun.

456
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:21,239
And that, my princess,
is my story in full.

457
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:26,219
When they summoned me, I was killing
a beast in the Scum Pit of Ur.

458
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:33,800
It's a great story.
And you're a great Groosalugg.

459
00:34:34,849 --> 00:34:35,760
But...

460
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,329
...I'm not your princess.

461
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,150
The truth is,
I'm not anybody's princess.

462
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,250
- Have you not the Curse?
- The visions?

463
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:51,559
Yeah, I've got visions
coming out of my ears.

464
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,710
But that doesn't make me a princess.

465
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,739
That just makes me kind of weird.

466
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:00,429
I do not understand.

467
00:35:02,449 --> 00:35:06,519
Where I come from,
who I really am...

468
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:11,219
...is so far from being a princess.
You have no idea.

469
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:16,409
I'm an actress.

470
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:19,269
- I do not know this word.
- Actress?

471
00:35:19,849 --> 00:35:22,800
It means when I'm lucky enough
to get the gig...

472
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:27,840
...people tell me what to do, where
to stand, how to move, what to say--

473
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:31,099
You're the concubine of your village.

474
00:35:31,849 --> 00:35:33,989
Felt like one sometimes.

475
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,599
Last job, I wore this horrible outfit.

476
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,809
It was this tiny,
skimpy, exploitative--

477
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:42,389
Nothing like this.

478
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:48,070
- Have they no eyes in this village?
- What do you mean?

479
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:53,289
Can they not just look upon you
and see that you are a princess?

480
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:57,710
I'm not.

481
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:01,800
Well, pardon my impudence, Majesty,
but you're wrong.

482
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:04,659
The Covenant has declared it so.

483
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,679
It doesn't matter what they say.

484
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,789
Then you declare it so.

485
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:16,300
You declare it with your bearing
and with your beauty...

486
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:19,969
...and the mercy you bestowed
upon your subject today.

487
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:22,170
He was a friend of mine.

488
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:27,130
If you treat all of your subjects
this way, you will do much good.

489
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,769
It's a beautiful dream.

490
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,869
Really, it is.

491
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,610
But it's not real.

492
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,110
Why not?

493
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:51,849
Parchment. She's asked for parchment.

494
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:55,170
- Some strange cow-mating ritual?
- No.

495
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:59,360
- She wants to make proclamations.
- Proclamations?

496
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:02,090
She's decided she can do some good.

497
00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:04,909
Then the com-shuk hasn't happened.

498
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:08,400
It's time to send
our princess a message.

499
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:12,809
I know how we send a message
to the princess. We storm the palace.

500
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:17,050
It'd be suicide.
We'd be wiped out in minutes.

501
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:21,070
- Yeah, but it'd be a message.
- Excuse me.

502
00:37:21,969 --> 00:37:24,389
- I couldn't help overhearing.
- Wesley!

503
00:37:24,969 --> 00:37:27,639
It's all right. We can help
these brave men.

504
00:37:27,969 --> 00:37:29,789
Shut up, reconnaissance scum.

505
00:37:30,369 --> 00:37:33,559
I've told you already,
we're not reconnaissance cows.

506
00:37:33,969 --> 00:37:37,409
We tracked you coming
from the palace. Don't lie.

507
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,289
I'm not lying. If you want
to send a message to her...

508
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:44,539
- ...then I know we can help.
- Shut up, Wesley.

509
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:46,559
How?

510
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:51,099
We just happen to be close
personal friends with the princess.

511
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:52,840
They know her!

512
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,380
- Close friends?
- I can prove it!

513
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,889
In my wallet--

514
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:03,670
The leather holder in the back
of my leg coverings.

515
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:06,820
That's it.

516
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:12,639
It's true.
They know the princess.

517
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:15,429
If you'd draw up a list of demands...

518
00:38:15,969 --> 00:38:19,059
...we'll be happy to present it
to Her Majesty.

519
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:22,659
- Let's do it. Write a list of demands.
- You see?

520
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:26,190
Put the list
and their severed heads...

521
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:29,510
...on display outside
the princess's window.

522
00:38:30,369 --> 00:38:33,110
I'm glad I left
my people behind in L.A...

523
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:36,039
...so I can come here to die.

524
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,289
Are you feeling any better?

525
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:20,210
It's okay. You don't have to talk.

526
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,340
I'm used to it.

527
00:39:27,889 --> 00:39:30,699
They saw it. They looked right at it.

528
00:39:34,489 --> 00:39:35,929
Saw what?

529
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:41,309
The monster.
They saw what I really am.

530
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:45,139
I can't go back.

531
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:47,539
Not now. I can never go back.

532
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:49,449
Never.

533
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:51,590
It's okay.

534
00:39:54,289 --> 00:39:55,340
You....

535
00:39:58,489 --> 00:40:00,769
You could stay here.

536
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:18,840
This will free the slaves
and outlaw polyester.

537
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,340
It hasn't been invented here yet...

538
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,369
...but I'm a forward-thinking monarch.

539
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:28,800
We didn't order anything.

540
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,769
Get out, cow.

541
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,690
You can't call him that.

542
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:40,690
He is Groosalugg,
the brave and undefeated.

543
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:45,659
- He is that only because I say he is.
- Groo! Where are you...?

544
00:40:48,889 --> 00:40:50,849
He just left.

545
00:40:51,889 --> 00:40:54,730
He understands the way of things.

546
00:40:55,489 --> 00:40:59,599
Yeah? Well, "the way of things"
is going to change around here.

547
00:41:00,289 --> 00:41:01,340
Is that right?

548
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:04,119
Way.

549
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,340
I've got proclamations.

550
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,460
- Foolish girl.
- Who's wearing the tiara here, pal?

551
00:41:12,289 --> 00:41:14,989
The Powers have placed
their gift in you.

552
00:41:15,889 --> 00:41:18,590
- Got that right.
- But let us be clear...

553
00:41:18,889 --> 00:41:21,380
- ...you have no authority.
- I'm the princess.

554
00:41:21,889 --> 00:41:25,300
You, like the Groosalugg,
are a tool of the Covenant.

555
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,909
You will do what we tell you.

556
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:30,840
If we tell you to mate,
you shall mate.

557
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,960
You can't force us to--

558
00:41:33,289 --> 00:41:36,380
If we tell you "silence,"
YOU shut your cow mouth!

559
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:39,670
Pardon me?

560
00:41:39,889 --> 00:41:41,920
Pardon, Your Majesty?

561
00:41:42,889 --> 00:41:45,940
Don't you feel you've done
enough pardoning...

562
00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:50,179
...for one day?

563
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:33,599
Thank you.
