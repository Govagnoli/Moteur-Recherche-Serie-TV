1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:04,559
- Previously:
- I have a roommate. He's a ghost.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,950
- He got sucked into the portal.
- They made me ruler.

3
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:14,089
Handsome man
saved me from the monsters.

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,809
- He's here.
- Angel.

5
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:18,300
I'd love to see that boy.

6
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,109
Get dressed and get out because the
next time I see you, I'll kill you.

7
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,990
I understand people who drink too much.

8
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:52,479
I understand people who say the
parking meter is broken when it's not.

9
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,740
I don't understand people
who worship demons.

10
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:58,530
Yeah, especially a Lurite demon.
The stink on that thing.

11
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:01,600
You're a prince of the underworld,
take a Jacuzzi sometime.

12
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,090
It's sad. The only way some
people can find a purpose...

13
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,560
...is by becoming
obsessed with demons.

14
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:12,079
By the way, Gunn, technically that
wasn't a Lurite, it was Murite.

15
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,959
Subspecies of the Lurite.

16
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,969
The male sports a small telltale fin
just behind the third shoulder.

17
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,730
Glad we're not the sad,
obsessed people.

18
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:24,250
We have to be a little obsessed.
We specialize in these things.

19
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,709
But we're not sad.

20
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:31,200
No, we're a happy and rambunctious
lot if I ever saw one.

21
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,750
Not going to humor me
even a little, huh?

22
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:35,530
Uh-uh.

23
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,409
I realize we sacrifice a great deal
of our social lives...

24
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:41,159
...but we have to. Work demands it.

25
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,810
True. Who's got time for love when
you're out doing it with the demons?

26
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,280
- Didn't that come out sad and wrong?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:52,810
I need to get out more. Speaking of,
anybody talk to Fred lately?

28
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,920
Not talk. Glimpsed. She pokes her head
out of her room once in a while.

29
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,049
Nice girl.

30
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:03,079
Nice. But not making the giant
strides toward mental health.

31
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,079
She's been hibernating up there
for three months.

32
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,889
Ever since Angel went away.
She's become quite attached to him.

33
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,000
Angel groupie. I get that.
He rescued her from Pylea.

34
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,610
I miss Pylea.

35
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:17,979
I would think you might.
You were there a week...

36
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:19,889
...they made you queen.

37
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,830
Fred was there five years.
She was a slave, a runaway.

38
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:26,590
They nearly chopped her head off.

39
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:29,530
All those years she spent
hiding out in that cave.

40
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,180
She survived. Girl's strong.

41
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,560
Girl's trading one cave for another.

42
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,509
How strong is that?

43
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,860
- When Angel comes back--
- When is he getting back?

44
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,030
- After working through grief.
- Buff--

45
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,189
Don't say the B word.

46
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:48,710
The B word was the love of his life.
And he's, what, 250?

47
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,560
That ain't no short life.

48
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,409
It's gonna take more
than a vacation in Sri Lanka.

49
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,789
It isn't a vacation, it's a
spiritual retreat at a monastery.

50
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:00,990
Angel and a bunch of monks in the
middle of nowhere. There's a party.

51
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,259
Should've got hammered
and gone to Vegas.

52
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:08,539
He doesn't need a lap dance, he needs
peace and quiet to work through this.

53
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,850
So whose turn is it to set the traps?

54
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,850
- His.
- His.

55
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,370
You amaze me. You'll fight hell beasts,
but you're scared of rats.

56
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,689
- I hate rats. Their beady eyes....
- And their beady teeth.

57
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:16,540
And their tails all:

58
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,949
Well, aren't you two just the
biggest scaredies I ever saw--

59
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,079
You're back!

60
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,949
You guys, he's back!

61
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,589
- Wesley.
- Welcome home.

62
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,480
Hey, what's up, man?

63
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:43,540
So, I hope you had a good retreat,
all peaceful and meditatey.

64
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,819
It was all right until the monks
turned out to be demons.

65
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,720
- Vegas.
- Yeah.

66
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,069
Well, the point is,
you worked on things.

67
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:56,949
It wasn't like a holiday where you'd
come back home to your friends...

68
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,160
...you know, with some small
mementos of your trip.

69
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,019
- Fishing for gifts?
- Yes.

70
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,110
Oh....

71
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:08,420
A small human head.

72
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,579
Cool.

73
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,079
Oh, my gosh. It's gorgeous!

74
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,300
And look how it brings out my breasts.

75
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:22,230
You know you were all thinking it.

76
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,800
- Oh.
- Thank you.

77
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,480
Sixteenth century....

78
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,560
Murshan Dynasty?
I've always wanted one of these.

79
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,480
I didn't think....

80
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,980
I can't wait to kill something with it.
Any visions brewing?

81
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,389
Place looks good.

82
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:43,439
How's Fred?

83
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,230
- Good. She's doing well.
- Hasn't come out of her room?

84
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:53,560
Not what you'd call frequently.
We send up a lot of tacos.

85
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,899
I'll settle in and check on her,
then you guys can bring me up to date.

86
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:02,319
It's really good to see you guys.

87
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:05,389
Thanks for the head.

88
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:08,000
He seems better than when he left.

89
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:12,199
Uh-huh.

90
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:23,730
Listen. Listen.

91
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:31,529
Oh, hi, how are you?
I'm just fine.

92
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,839
Doing real good here. No need to worry
about me, but thanks for checking.

93
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,240
It's me, Fred.

94
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:40,470
Angel.

95
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:45,680
Hey! Hey, you're--
Well, hey, there.

96
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,819
It's good to-- Did you have a nice--?

97
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,540
Oh, here, let me
make some room.

98
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:53,600
I can't come in.

99
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:57,329
Of course. You're worn from your trip.
You go rest. We'll catch up later.

100
00:07:58,089 --> 00:07:59,879
I just can't come in unless you--

101
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,000
I invite you, instead of being rude.

102
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:08,620
Oh, come in, come in.

103
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:15,120
It's just a smidge of vampire in you,
as far as I'm concerned.

104
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:17,910
But the universe has rules.

105
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,579
I'm a big believer in rules
and theorems, formulas.

106
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:25,529
- I get that.
- Aphorisms leave me a little dry.

107
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:27,509
How are you?

108
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,889
Yeah, good.

109
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,990
Everything's pretty much
like when you...

110
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:37,850
...you know, went away on your trip.

111
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:41,169
- Sorry I left so suddenly--
- Hey, no.

112
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,320
You had things you had
to take care of...

113
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,799
...and I don't need a babysitter or--
You're sticking around now, right?

114
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,090
Yeah, I am.

115
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,909
Good.

116
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,090
"Listen, listen."
What are you listening for?

117
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,379
The click.

118
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:08,309
When it all comes together
and makes sense...

119
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:12,220
...there's a click in your brain
and you understand things again.

120
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,879
What happens if you run out of
wall space before you get the click?

121
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:20,169
I don't know.

122
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:24,299
Fred, you know, you spent...

123
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:31,490
...five years in a place
where humans...

124
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:34,850
...could only be slaves or fugitives.

125
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:39,220
I know that wasn't a picnic for you,
but you're home now.

126
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,809
You're safe.
You can come out of your room.

127
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,690
I know it's gonna take some time.

128
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:52,320
Time? I have a whole treatise on that.

129
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,690
It seems to take a lot of it to do
just about anything these days.

130
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:01,080
Fred. Fred.

131
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,320
Fred, you don't have to write
absolutely everything down.

132
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,799
Oh, right. God, I should
write that down.

133
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:14,690
You just need to take
some small steps.

134
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:18,549
Huh?

135
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:24,470
Like coming downstairs...

136
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,200
...and hanging with us for a while.

137
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,620
What do you say?
Nothing to be scared of.

138
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:34,000
You're safe here in the hotel.

139
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:38,559
Hold that thought.

140
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:53,200
What is it? What do you see?

141
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:58,230
A bunch of vampires,
and they're crashing a party.

142
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,789
- They're killing people.
- Where?

143
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:04,490
Wilson College. Bonner Hall.

144
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,350
- Room 918.
- 918.

145
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,639
They're gonna take hostages.

146
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:11,870
Watch out for the blond.
She's the worst.

147
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:16,309
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Go, go!

148
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:35,830
- So much for inviting everyone.
- Some of them are still alive.

149
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:39,460
There's been an accident.
We need two, maybe three ambulances.

150
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,610
Wilson College, Bonner Hall,
Room 918. Hurry.

151
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,259
They're heading east.
Take the car.

152
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:47,309
What are you gonna do?

153
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:52,460
Oh.

154
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,129
- Please....
- Huh?

155
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:07,100
Please don't hurt her.

156
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,159
You love her?

157
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,429
You'd do anything for her.

158
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:21,070
What if we just kill her
and let you go?

159
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,039
Huh?

160
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,809
Come on now.
Life's about making choices.

161
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,200
You or her?
What's it gonna be?

162
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,409
Her. Take her. Oh, God....

163
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,509
Gee, Bobby, you call that love?

164
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:50,509
We get home,
I'll show you what love is.

165
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:01,139
Run!

166
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:33,960
Angelus?

167
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:04,980
Too bright. Too bright.

168
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,840
Thank you, Dennis.

169
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,220
How did I ever live without a ghost?

170
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,600
Hot. Really hot, please.

171
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:41,710
These visions are killing me.
It's getting worse every time.

172
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,610
Oh, Dennis, what would
I do without you?

173
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:23,049
No....

174
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:39,649
- Young love.
- Give it a century.

175
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,870
A century? A mere hundred years?

176
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:44,480
I'd need 1000 to sketch
the plane of your face.

177
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:47,409
I would need 10,000
to name the color of your eyes.

178
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:50,379
They're green, but take your time.
In fact, don't.

179
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:53,370
We have a ship to catch,
and Holtz may not be far behind.

180
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:56,019
You know neither poetry
nor love, Angelus.

181
00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:00,389
He knows other things.
Marvellously vile and ripping things.

182
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,330
- Didn't we eat a poet in Madrid?
- Troubadour.

183
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,240
Everything's closed. Pity. I wanted to
spend some of the count's gold on you.

184
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:09,230
We need it for the voyage.

185
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,059
The Count de Leon was a little rich
for my blood. I'll be full for a week.

186
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,360
- The fire was excessive.
- Of course it was.

187
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,500
- We burnt his villa to the ground.
- We made a statement.

188
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,860
A statement, as in, "Here we are,
Holtz. Hunt us down."

189
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,539
Oh, who cares about Holtz?

190
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,730
You would if you knew him.
He's killed scores of us.

191
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,620
Hunted Angelus and I across Europe.

192
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,029
God, he follows us to Morocco,
what then? The New World?

193
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:37,950
- I say we stay and fight the bastard.
- Yeah, but you're an idiot.

194
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:41,509
I don't think he's the most formidable
vampire-killer in the world.

195
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,659
"None lives to tell the tale"
and all. You lived to tell the tale.

196
00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:49,419
I heard he trapped you
both in a barn...

197
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:52,840
...and you fled, leaving him to die.

198
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:55,600
- It's not true?
- It's entirely true.

199
00:16:55,929 --> 00:17:00,639
She hit me with a shovel, wished me
luck and rode off on our only horse.

200
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:06,740
- Life's full of surprises.
- Life's dull. You're full of surprises.

201
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:09,150
When he finally did
catch me in Vienna...

202
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,519
...I had to pay for my sins.
Again and again.

203
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,019
Can you even begin to fathom
the things we did?

204
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:19,210
Course not. You're in love.

205
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,210
Let's not dawdle, children.

206
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,119
It's so pretty.

207
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:29,660
No, it's not.

208
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:33,640
- James?
- Not as pretty as it's going to be...

209
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,210
...when it's worn by
the prettiest one of all.

210
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,299
I adore it. I'll never take it off.

211
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,509
This is where love gets you.

212
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,740
Elisabeth, you and Darla
get to the ship. We'll join you there.

213
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,720
Let's give them a rout,
what do you say?

214
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:03,960
I'd say you're an idiot,
but I'd just be repeating myself.

215
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,019
Bloody frogs! I broke the
window, and I'll break your skulls!

216
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,250
See, all you have to do
is stand up to them.

217
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,349
What are you afraid of?

218
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,019
Not us.

219
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:32,730
Hope she treasures that locket.

220
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:36,400
- Then what?
- Huh?

221
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,119
- What happened with Holtz?
- Oh, that's another story.

222
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,450
- We got time.
- I'm not sure we do.

223
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,549
No, because James and Elisabeth
had the forever love.

224
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,900
If he's still around
and he finds out who killed her--

225
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,829
- He'll want revenge.
- If he's around and they're in love.

226
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,940
- It was a long time ago.
- 200-plus years...

227
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,640
...and she's still got the locket.

228
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,559
Gunn and I'll hit the streets.
See what our sources know.

229
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:01,779
Uh-huh. See?
We have sources now.

230
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,180
- You're almost like real detectives.
- Hey.

231
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:08,089
Just kidding.
You should probably check it out.

232
00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:10,460
- James really lived for that girl.
- Yeah.

233
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,890
We did all we could, but they were....
He was too much for us.

234
00:19:31,329 --> 00:19:35,680
- Angelus.
- One of our own hunting us. It's sick.

235
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,619
How is it possible?
The Angelus I knew--

236
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,630
He's not the same. Gypsies cursed him
with a soul 100 years ago or so.

237
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:47,049
He's got a business here in L.A.
He kills us for money.

238
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:50,940
She's gone.

239
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,079
It was horrible. She was bringing
you two ripe and rosy humans...

240
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,359
...and he just flew out of the sky--

241
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,980
- And you ran.
- No, I fought.

242
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,519
Till I saw it was hopeless.

243
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:06,039
I thought you wanted to know
how it happened. Who did it.

244
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,799
And now I do.

245
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,009
You want to be alone.

246
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,160
No. I want to die.

247
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:36,519
What?

248
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:38,630
- What?
- What do you want to say?

249
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,309
Me? Nothing.
What makes you think I want--?

250
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:44,000
Because I know you.

251
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:48,299
- It's really none of my business.
- And that always stops you.

252
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:53,380
It is my business because we're
trying to do a job here...

253
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,609
...and what affects
you affects me...

254
00:20:56,609 --> 00:21:00,049
...and anyway, I don't like to see
you suffer more than you have to.

255
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:04,000
I don't think you should blame
yourself or feel guilty for her death.

256
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:06,480
I don't.

257
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:09,900
Good. Glad to hear it.

258
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,430
I didn't even know who
she was when I killed her.

259
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:17,029
Not her. Angel....

260
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:20,559
Oh.

261
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:22,150
You want to talk about--

262
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:25,680
She was the love of your life,
and she died.

263
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:36,680
And you weren't there
when it happened.

264
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:41,140
You couldn't help her fight.

265
00:21:41,609 --> 00:21:43,859
You couldn't save her.

266
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,829
You couldn't die with her.

267
00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:01,500
This is gonna be one of those talks
where I do all the talking, isn't it?

268
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,069
Well, I'm not gonna pry.

269
00:22:05,609 --> 00:22:07,930
It's not my style.
Okay, it's totally my style...

270
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:10,109
...but I'm not getting anywhere
right now.

271
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:15,150
But you have to tell me one thing.
You owe me this much.

272
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:17,109
What happened with Holtz?

273
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,859
- Where is she?
- How's your health?

274
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,490
- Mine's grand. Thanks for asking.
- Where is she?

275
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:28,259
He wants Darla. A thorn in his side.

276
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:31,750
What we did to his family.
Tasty. Especially the little ones.

277
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:34,430
Your wife, she kept repeating on us.

278
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:38,170
Of course, you know, I repeated
on her a few times myself.

279
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:49,289
There are worse things
than death, Angelus.

280
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,180
I can keep you alive for months,
years, if I've a mind to.

281
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:56,940
Now, you are going
to tell me where she is.

282
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:01,430
I am going to tell you. Who's arguing?
I don't want to suffer needlessly.

283
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:05,950
- She's with his lass.
- Shut your mouth, coward!

284
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:08,769
He's in love.
It's all very passionate.

285
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,670
How about I give you him
and the women?

286
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,529
- Down at the docks.
- I'll kill you!

287
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:19,079
Kill them!

288
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:28,279
Stop them! Stop them, you idiots!
They're getting away! Fan out!

289
00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:45,839
I think we lost them.

290
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:49,930
I'd kill you if I didn't
have to get to Elisabeth.

291
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:52,819
I'm laying here with arrows
in me, saving your life.

292
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:56,559
I'll tell Darla the utter
lack of concern you had for her.

293
00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:00,480
Buy her a hat. She loves hats.

294
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:04,779
Why are people always running off
and leaving me?

295
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:07,220
Am I a bad bloke?

296
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:11,339
I don't think so.
Not once you get to know me.

297
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,339
I'm gonna need a doctor.

298
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,509
You can't go in there. He's sloughing.

299
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:22,599
- Dr. Gregson, I tried to tell him.
- It's all right, Sandy.

300
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,329
I go through this every month,
just like a woman.

301
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:34,000
So I gather this is
a matter of some urgency.

302
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,369
I need it.

303
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,829
- It?
- The cure.

304
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:43,569
You're aware of the price?
It's a steep one.

305
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:45,799
I've already paid it.

306
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:49,390
All right, then.
Sandy, let's prepare the patient.

307
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,170
Now, James...

308
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,380
...this shouldn't hurt.

309
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:04,609
Too much.

310
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,200
- He said he had something?
- He did.

311
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:56,130
- When's he gonna show?
- Anytime now.

312
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,759
You youngsters wanna button it up?
I'm trying to enjoy the show here.

313
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:04,950
See, that's real singing
there. That's real music.

314
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:07,009
Okay, pops.

315
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:08,809
What do you know?

316
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,819
I'm not dealing
if the bloodsucker's around.

317
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,180
- Angel's not here.
- Good. He's always beating me up...

318
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,230
...or hanging me upside down...

319
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,930
...and he never pays up
like he's supposed to.

320
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,440
I could've made a living in Akron.
I never would've come back here.

321
00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:10,039
Tick-tock, Merl.

322
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:15,950
This thing took more legwork than
I estimated. Price is gonna change.

323
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,750
- Really?
- Yeah.

324
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,160
All right.

325
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,839
Hey. Hey.

326
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,519
Hey, hey, hey.

327
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:31,279
This guy James you're looking for,
he's alive...

328
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,490
...he's in town, and he knows
what Angel did to his heartthrob.

329
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,460
He's out for blood.

330
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,549
Yeah, do that.
I'll cover this end. Thanks.

331
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,569
- What's up?
- He's alive.

332
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,000
- Wes and Gunn will find him.
- What if they can't?

333
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,019
I know where he'll be headed.

334
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,079
- Here. For you.
- I want you to go home and stay there.

335
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,319
- No.
- Yes.

336
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,579
- Uh-uh.
- Where's my ax? This is all different.

337
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:57,220
I moved some things
while you were gone.

338
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:59,910
They were dust catchers.

339
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,680
- Go home.
- I am sticking with you.

340
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,509
I appreciate your courage,
but I don't want you hurt.

341
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:10,740
I don't either. I go home, he'll come
after me because I'm home alone.

342
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,349
They come after you when you're alone.

343
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,180
Oh, sure, "Cordy, go home,
be a hostage...

344
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,720
...with the torture and the fear
and the tor--"

345
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:22,599
Will you, just once, do what I tell you
without arguing about everything?

346
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,650
Hurling ax. Basement?

347
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:29,859
I just know I'd be a lot safer by your
side rather than all alone at home.

348
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:36,009
Why'd you do it?

349
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:41,839
Because I had what
you could never have?

350
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:43,319
Get back!

351
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,430
Angel? I thought I heard company.

352
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:59,339
I came out of my room.
Small steps, like you said.

353
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:05,410
- Go back to your room and stay there.
- Okay, then.

354
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:10,920
I don't know where he is now,
but I know where he was.

355
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:12,970
- Where?
- Dr. Gregson's.

356
00:29:13,329 --> 00:29:17,019
- What kind of doctor is that?
- A demon kind. A Slod demon.

357
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:21,220
- Slod demon? What's he do?
- He's a collector.

358
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:42,220
- I told you to--
- Shut up and stake him!

359
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:44,869
Oops.

360
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:48,849
You never loved anyone or anything.

361
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,299
Go to hell.

362
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:04,450
- Okay. It's all right, It's over.
- Okay.

363
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:14,230
Over in what sense?

364
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,160
- Shouldn't he be on fire?
- Let's get out of here.

365
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,220
- My coat. It's stuck.
- Leave it.

366
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,029
- Go that way.
- Where are you going?

367
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,190
Go.

368
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:07,369
Cordy, this way. Hurry up.

369
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:19,690
Don't stakes through the heart
and sunshine kill you guys?

370
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:21,180
- He's become--
- Invincible?

371
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,190
Let's not exaggerate.

372
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,150
The ring of Amarra. When you had that,
you were invincible.

373
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:29,720
- Does he have a ring?
- No.

374
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,539
Did the Amarra people make cuff links?

375
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:34,700
- There was only one.
- You smashed it!

376
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,920
- Why don't we recriminate later, okay?
- Yes.

377
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,710
Now be quiet.
I think he took the bait.

378
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:44,470
- Earthquake.
- Subway.

379
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:48,069
Okay, just the subway.

380
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:53,680
- Jeez!
- Sorry.

381
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:56,750
Cordelia, is that you?
Can you hear me?

382
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,740
Huh? What? Say that again.

383
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,569
There's something you have
to know about James.

384
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:09,200
Oh, he's invincible, is he?
He went to a what?

385
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,609
Slod demon? What's that?

386
00:32:12,049 --> 00:32:15,380
It's some kind of doctor demon
that collects rare organs.

387
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:20,500
Cut out his heart?
Absolutely cannot be killed.

388
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:23,789
- Wait, what? How long?
- Six....

389
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,849
Six what?

390
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:28,799
What? Hello?

391
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,460
No signal.

392
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:34,970
The guy is invincible, but it only
lasts for so long, then he dies.

393
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,779
How long?

394
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,690
He said-- I don't know.
Six minutes, hours, weeks.

395
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:42,359
I hate these.
Give me a signal.

396
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:45,910
That's good news.
All we have to do is wait him out.

397
00:32:46,849 --> 00:32:50,220
Right. We'll just wait here
until we're sure.

398
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,250
Cordy, up there.

399
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:27,670
What a creep.

400
00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:39,089
Should we get off and double back?
He won't expect it.

401
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,869
Or should we stay put
to the end of the line...

402
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,440
...and get as much distance
between us as poss--

403
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:46,819
- Shh!
- What?

404
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:50,529
He couldn't possibly....

405
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,349
Get back. Get back.

406
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:58,220
Well, this is a new twist
in an old snake.

407
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:01,009
Is it possible you care about
someone who isn't you?

408
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:03,170
Don't worry about her.

409
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:06,930
But if you've changed, if you're not
the man who screwed Darla...

410
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,599
...and couldn't care about her....

411
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,829
Where did you hear...?
Oh, you mean back in the day. Right.

412
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:15,550
He has changed a lot.

413
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:18,829
He has a soul now,
and he cares about people.

414
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:21,659
So you might feel something
when I snap her neck.

415
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:24,940
Well, it's not like he's losing sleep
with the caring.

416
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:28,079
Lucky me. Now I can kill
the woman you love.

417
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:31,320
- No, you can't.
- Are you forgetting who's invincible?

418
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:34,400
The woman I love is dead.

419
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,400
Who you talking about?

420
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:41,519
It happened about three months ago.
We try not to say her name too much.

421
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,889
You loved someone?

422
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,539
With all your heart?

423
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,659
Yeah.

424
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:56,170
No, you didn't.

425
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:00,510
Because if you had, you wouldn't be
standing here playing games with me.

426
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:04,599
You wouldn't be able to.
Because when she died...

427
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:09,369
...when some bastard killed her,
it would have killed everything in you.

428
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:14,019
- I wouldn't be able to go on living.
- Don't worry, you won't.

429
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,860
She won't, either.

430
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,519
Angel!

431
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,019
Catch him!

432
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:29,989
Come on.

433
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:33,480
How's that feel, invincible boy?

434
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:38,449
This your idea of love, James?
It's not real unless it kills you?

435
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,559
Yeah. What's yours? It's fun as long
as it doesn't cost me anything?

436
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,940
You don't know what love is.

437
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:55,070
You think you won
just because you're still alive?

438
00:35:56,610 --> 00:36:00,889
I lived. You just existed.

439
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:22,940
- How's Fred?
- She's all right.

440
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:27,659
We talked over what happened, and
I think she'll come out any decade now.

441
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:29,469
And how are you?

442
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:33,019
- I'm o--
- Don't say okay, please. I know you.

443
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:37,469
Ever since you came back,
I can tell that something's not right.

444
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,650
And obviously it's not.

445
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:44,179
Buffy's dead, and I don't
mean to diminish that.

446
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,789
I miss her too.

447
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:49,650
I just want to say,
I know that James...

448
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:52,650
...with all his
Romeo and Juliet madness...

449
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:57,800
...opened up a lot of wounds for you,
but you'll be okay.

450
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,719
I am okay.

451
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,900
Then what's the problem?

452
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,449
That I'm okay.
That losing Buffy didn't kill me.

453
00:37:09,889 --> 00:37:12,210
That I could deal with it.

454
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:18,340
In all those years,
no one ever mattered.

455
00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:20,920
Not like she did.

456
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:25,469
And now she's gone. Forever.

457
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:30,199
- And you're still here.
- Yeah.

458
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:32,679
It feels like I'm
betraying her somehow.

459
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:36,800
No. If you were a loser, if you were
a sick, obsessed vampire...

460
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:41,280
...then you'd go to a Snod demon or
whatever and get your heart cut out.

461
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,199
But you're not.

462
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:47,250
You're a living, breathing....

463
00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:50,039
Well, living, anyway...

464
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,099
...good guy, who's still fighting
and trying to help people.

465
00:37:54,289 --> 00:37:57,730
And that's not betraying her,
that's honoring her.

466
00:37:58,489 --> 00:38:00,070
You think?

467
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:04,889
I'm Cordelia. I don't think,
I know. Okay?

468
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:10,019
Okay.

469
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:13,260
So can we get back to work now?

470
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,230
Yeah, sure. There's work?

471
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:20,780
- What do you know about Nester demons?
- They live in walls of homes.

472
00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:24,199
They hatch several times a year.
Do you have to kill the queen?

473
00:38:24,889 --> 00:38:27,170
If you don't, they infest again,
worse than ever.

474
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,030
We killed some in Hancock Park
a few months ago.

475
00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:33,239
- I don't think we got the queen.
- Well, let's go find out.

476
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:52,500
Sorry it took so long.
He's a very difficult shaman to find.

477
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:55,159
You can go.

478
00:38:55,489 --> 00:38:57,380
Oh, no, no, no, no.

479
00:38:57,889 --> 00:39:01,610
I thought we'd have a drink
to celebrate.

480
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,340
No, thanks.

481
00:39:06,289 --> 00:39:08,150
Don't be so shy, little one.

482
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,880
You get to know me,
I'm a very nice man.

483
00:39:12,889 --> 00:39:15,840
How much can one little
drink hurt, huh?

484
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:19,300
- Depends on who's doing the drinking.
- Mm.

485
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:24,480
I thought you might have a surprise
or two in you.

486
00:39:24,889 --> 00:39:28,050
Well, you know what they say.

487
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:42,059
Life's full of surprises.
