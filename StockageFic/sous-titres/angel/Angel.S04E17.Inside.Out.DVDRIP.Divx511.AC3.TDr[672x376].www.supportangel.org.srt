right under my beak?

13
00:00:31,093 --> 00:00:34,881
Having two part-demon parents
might explain the "whoosh" factor.

14
00:00:35,053 --> 00:00:39,922
Connor, before our baby comes, I might
ask you to do some things for us.

00:00:40,093 --> 00:00:43,563

00:01:01,973 --> 00:01:04,407
...it was you, wasn't it?

21
00:01:04,573 --> 00:01:08,248
Took you long enough to figure it out.
But nice turn with the Lorne bait.

22

There was a time
I would have seen that one coming...

...eons before it ever crossed
your tiny little mind.

Same phrase the Beastmaster
kept using...

...when he was whispering
in Angelus' head.

34
00:01:40,053 --> 00:01:42,806

for the booming macho act.

00:04:37,173 --> 00:04:40,722
Has she been like this since she
got back from that higher wherever?

And what about that amnesia thing?

76
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:44,962
- Was that a fake out?
- Or a side effect.

77
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:48,125
Descending to a lower dimension
was probably disorienting.

Maybe this thing was curled deep inside

You know why.

They're afraid.

How could he do that?

00:07:25,093 --> 00:07:26,970

He hates you for being with me.

00:07:41,413 --> 00:07:44,803
He can't stand the fact that he lost.

132
00:07:45,653 --> 00:07:48,565
That he'll never know the feel

00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:40,006
If Connor doesn't wanna be found,
he won't.

144
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,371
Wasting your time.

And I couldn't see it.

00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:57,128
- The thought of losing her to Connor...
- Did exactly what it was supposed to.

Play on your emotions

Draw your attention away so this thing

for letting it happen.

Wes.

154
00:09:16,253 --> 00:09:19,609
- Lilah and I weren't exactly friends...
- You were mortal enemies.

155
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:22,484
Why should you care
what happened to her?

156
00:09:23,253 --> 00:09:24,971
Because you did.

157
00:09:31,293 --> 00:09:33,204
There's nothing here.

158
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:37,082
If this thing could obliterate
all references to the Beast...

159
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:40,165
...it's very unlikely it would
leave its own bio laying about.

160
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,893
What about pan-dimensional texts,
like the one Lilah...

161
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:49,769
I have Lorne reaching out to
the black markets, but it'll take time.

162
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:52,003
Great. Another thing we don't have.

00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:53,925
Then let's go to the source.

00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,572
Whatever happened to Cordelia...

165
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:58,327
...took place after her ascension
to the higher planes.

166
00:09:58,493 --> 00:10:01,485
- Maybe the Powers might...
- Last couple of times I asked them...

167
00:10:01,653 --> 00:10:04,804
...for help, they made it damn clear
they weren't in the business.

168
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:07,203
At least one of those
was to save Darla's life...

169
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:13,164
...a mass-murdering, ex-vampire dying
of syphilis. A strong "no" is not a shock.

170
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,564
You think the Powers couldn't see
this thing was masquerading as Cordy?

171
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:18,325
What it was doing to us?

172

You're saying her ascension
was all part of this thing's plan?

No. Cordelia was chosen
to become a higher being...

Cordy was made a higher being because
she proved herself to the Powers.

You know how many lines have...

...to intersect
for a thing like this to play out?

448
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:54,129
How many events have to be nudged
in just the right direction.

- Connor.
- An impossible birth...

459
00:27:19,253 --> 00:27:22,609
...to make one possible.
- That's what the kid was designed for.

460
00:27:22,773 --> 00:27:24,968
- To sleep with Mother Love?
- To create a vessel.

Look out, the monkey's thinking again.

462
00:27:27,293 --> 00:27:30,842
Being in a human makes it vulnerable.
That's why it had to stay hidden.

463
00:27:31,013 --> 00:27:34,449
Why it needed to create something
stronger to pour itself into.

464
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:38,731
Wait. So the big nasty inside of Cordy
is gonna give birth to itself?

465
00:27:38,893 --> 00:27:40,884
Circle of life. It's a beautiful thing.

466
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,166

SKIP: That's the easy part, slick.

00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:47,604
All you gotta do is find Cordelia
and chop her head off.

00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,563
- Has to be another way.
SKIP: Sure.

469
00:27:50,773 --> 00:27:52,411
Stab her in the heart, kidney.

470
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:56,009
- Couple of pokes in the...
- A way that won't kill her in the process.

471
00:27:56,173 --> 00:27:59,449
Takes a whole lot of cramming to get
that much sweetness into a human.

472
00:27:59,653 --> 00:28:03,202
It's in every hair, every cell,
every molecule of Cordelia's body.

473
00:28:03,373 --> 00:28:06,126
And it ain't letting go until
it got a brand-new bag.

474
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:08,045
What happens to Cordy then?

475
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:12,087
Drained of her life force during labor.
Those contractions are a real bitch.

476
00:28:12,253 --> 00:28:15,086
- It'll kill her?
- Or she'll end up a head of cabbage.

00:28:15,813 --> 00:28:18,373
- What do you wanna do?
- The only thing he can do.

478
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:20,524
Kill the woman he loves
to save the world.

479
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:22,651
Times like this...

480
00:28:22,813 --> 00:28:25,771
...really gotta suck being you.
- How do I find her?

481
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:30,490
- How?
- Well, I'd go with the Bu'shundi Ritual...

482
00:28:30,653 --> 00:28:33,645
...but you're gonna need
a sacred Hutamin paw for that.

483
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:35,531
- Got it!
- What?

484
00:28:35,693 --> 00:28:38,253
Cordy, the real Cordy,
kept one in her desk drawer.

485
00:28:38,413 --> 00:28:41,723
Probably a knockoff. It's not some
trinket you throw in a desk drawer.

486
00:28:41,893 --> 00:28:44,361
- She thought it was a back scratcher.
ANGEL: Get started.

487
00:28:44,653 --> 00:28:48,407
Wait, wait. Did I say Bu'shundi?
I meant Ru'shundi.

488
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:50,723
It's a whole different...

489
00:28:53,853 --> 00:28:54,888
Crap.

490
00:28:55,813 --> 00:28:57,405
They hate us...

491
00:28:57,573 --> 00:28:59,370
...because we're special.

492
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:02,730
I don't hate you. Please.

493
00:29:02,893 --> 00:29:07,091
They're scared because of what you've
done, not because of what you are.

494
00:29:07,253 --> 00:29:09,847
They wanted to kill me
when I was still inside of you.

495
00:29:10,013 --> 00:29:11,924
But that changed
when they saw you.

496
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:14,488
Held you in their arms.

497
00:29:14,693 --> 00:29:16,684
Felt the warmth of your skin...

498
00:29:16,853 --> 00:29:18,571
...the goodness in your heart.

499
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:21,201
And it will happen again
when they hold my child.

500
00:29:24,773 --> 00:29:27,890
- It's the only way.
- You have a choice, Connor.

501
00:29:28,293 --> 00:29:30,727
That is something more precious
than you'll ever know.

502
00:29:30,893 --> 00:29:33,965
What choice?
They're hunting us like animals.

503
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:36,328
Because you're acting like one.

504
00:29:37,373 --> 00:29:42,288
As a vampire, I killed without mercy
or remorse because I didn't have a soul.

505
00:29:42,733 --> 00:29:44,803
What's your excuse?

506
00:29:45,053 --> 00:29:47,886
- You think I want to do this?
- Then don't.

507
00:29:48,573 --> 00:29:50,404
I have to.

508
00:29:50,573 --> 00:29:52,211
Why?

509
00:29:52,413 --> 00:29:54,643
Because she told you?

510
00:29:56,533 --> 00:30:00,924
There are things happening, Connor.
Things that I can't...

511
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:06,527
It has to be your choice.

512
00:30:06,893 --> 00:30:09,168
You can stop this.

513
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:14,491
Her blood for our baby's.

514
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:18,051
It's fair, isn't it?

515
