1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:03,680
- Previously on Angel:
- That's her.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,950
So you're what they
brought back in that box as human.

3
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:12,390
- We want him dark, not dead.
- Forces can change Angel to Angelus.

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,429
He knows happiness, he goes evil.

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,829
We were together 150 years.

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,800
- The middle one.
- She has the sight.

7
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:24,010
She is innocence.
We'll turn her into one of us.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,170
The gypsies gave you a soul.
A filthy soul! No!

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,340
- I remember everything.
- You have a soul now.

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,549
Soon those memories start
eating away at you.

11
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:38,590
Believe me, I know.

12
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:05,450
- What is it, Wesley?
- "It"?

13
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,540
There's no it.

14
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,459
It's nothing, really.

15
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,909
Just popping around,
see if everything's all right.

16
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,989
- Fine.
- Oh, good. Good.

17
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,049
You're certain?

18
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,640
Uh-huh.

19
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,189
Good night.

20
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:26,769
Good night.

21
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:29,799
You're still here.

22
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:34,659
Apparently. So you're sure there's
nothing on your mind?

23
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,180
That is to say, nothing you'd
like to perhaps share?

24
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,189
Nope.

25
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,400
Really?

26
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,000
Hello, Lindsey.

27
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,699
- You're bleeding.
- I guess I am.

28
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:35,800
- Something happened?
- Oh, God, yes.

29
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:40,840
So many things, I remember them all.
Which one were you thinking of?

30
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,750
It was too soon.
We shouldn't have sent you to him.

31
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:52,169
Lindsey. You never talk
about yourself, Lindsey.

32
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,300
Got a girlfriend? Boyfriend?

33
00:02:57,129 --> 00:02:58,250
Someone special?

34
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,650
There's no one.

35
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,020
No. No, there really isn't, is there?

36
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,530
You can be with someone for 150 years,
think you know them.

37
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,490
Still, doesn't work out.

38
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,250
Angelus.
Oh, you should've seen us together.

39
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:20,129
He was different then.

40
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:22,960
And so was I.

41
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,319
Do you know what we've become?

42
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,759
Enemies.

43
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,449
Oh, no. Much worse.

44
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:39,400
Now we're soul mates.

45
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,610
Someone close the shutters.

46
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,670
Seems wrong that I should die
while the sun is still so bright.

47
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:20,589
You'll not see it again.

48
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,420
Before it sets,
you will have left this life.

49
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:31,100
I didn't ask for a priest.
Who invited him here?

50
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:34,910
You did. You cried out for me
in your delirium.

51
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:37,779
I don't remember.

52
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,180
Do you even know what I am?

53
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,209
A woman of some property.

54
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:46,319
No husband, no inheritance.

55
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,779
Yes, I know what you are.

56
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,800
- I'm a whore.
- Well, yes. That too.

57
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:58,910
You should've asked for a priest long
ago. Your life may have been better.

58
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,180
And you should've visited me
before today, Father.

59
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,959
Your life may have been more
interesting for it.

60
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:12,180
Are you prepared now to renounce
Satan and beg God his forgiveness?

61
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,079
God never did anything for me.

62
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:16,920
Leave us.

63
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,990
You can't save her life.

64
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,870
Perhaps I can still save her soul.

65
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:29,730
My soul is well past saving.

66
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:32,620
Let the Devil take me if he wants.

67
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:35,620
Either way, I die.

68
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,360
No, you will not die.

69
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,339
You will be reborn.

70
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,129
I know you.

71
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,759
I came to you last night.

72
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:57,050
I sang to you from that window.

73
00:06:58,649 --> 00:06:59,879
I remember now.

74
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:02,699
You're Death?

75
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:04,529
No.

76
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:07,319
What then?

77
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,319
I'm your savior.

78
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:13,490
God never did anything for you.

79
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:17,060
But I will.

80
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,660
I think this is a really bad idea.

81
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,620
We can't wait for Wolfram & Hart
to make a move. Let's get ahead.

82
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:36,360
- Will it involve kidnapping?
- All we do is find her.

83
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,620
This is the woman you didn't know
was in your bedroom for three weeks?

84
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:44,870
- That was different.
- Different, yeah.

85
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:47,269
- Cordelia has a point.
- Finally!

86
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:52,029
Before, Darla wanted to be found.
Now she's out among 6 million people.

87
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:54,089
She could be anywhere.

88
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:58,350
We're detectives, we investigate.
That's what we're good at.

89
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,949
It's what we suck at.
Unless there's a website:

90
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,500
"www.Darla-is-stashed-here.com,"
we're out of luck.

91
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,339
It's not gonna be easy.

92
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,610
Before, he said he could smell her.

93
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,420
How about we cruise around
with the top down...

94
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,470
...and you take big whiffs?

95
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:25,259
We'll wait until after the sun sets.

96
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:28,079
Big firm, they gotta have housing.

97
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,079
It's not as if they
flew her in from Miami.

98
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,990
She was raised from the depths
of hell by an ancient ritual.

99
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,629
They got to put her up.
That's an expense.

100
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:43,820
You think these lawyers have
no way to write that off?

101
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:50,340
- I'll examine their real estate.
- Subsidiary holdings as well.

102
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,169
She'd want something with a view.

103
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:56,809
Darla always loved a view.

104
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,559
Angelus.

105
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,179
The Latinate for "Angel."
It's marvelous!

106
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:10,330
His name would be legend
had he left anyone alive to tell it.

107
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,279
You had a nice trip.

108
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:13,899
I'm so glad.

109
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:18,340
We cut a bloody swath
through Wales and England.

110
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:20,080
He was magnificent.

111
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,440
Yorkshiremen. Tough as leather.

112
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,789
Darla tells me you're a master.

113
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,049
The Master. He commands our order.

114
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,460
The Order of Aurelius.
We are the select, the elite.

115
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:37,759
And you live in the sewers?

116
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,330
We lurk below, giving tribute
to the Old Ones...

117
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,929
...awaiting that promised day
when we will arise.

118
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,879
Arise and lay waste
to the world above!

119
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:53,750
- Why'd you want to do that?
- Huh?

120
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, I mean, have you
been above lately?

121
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,559
It's quite nice.

122
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:05,240
Me, I could never live in a
rat-infested stinkhole like this.

123
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:09,980
Pardon me, but I gotta have
me a proper bed or I'm a terror.

124
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,809
Isn't that right, love?

125
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:14,009
He's young.

126
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,039
And this one,
down and goose feathers...

127
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,509
...and the finest linens.
And the view.

128
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,730
She's always gotta have the view,
don't you, my lamb?

129
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,539
We fed recently.
The blood is still hot in his veins.

130
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,169
You noticed that?

131
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:33,200
We stalk the surface to feed
and grow our ranks.

132
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:36,659
We do not live amongst
the human pestilence.

133
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,970
I'll be honest. You couldn't
with that face, could you?

134
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:43,970
Angelus!

135
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:47,710
It's not stuck like that, is it?

136
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:50,460
The Master has outgrown
human features.

137
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:53,220
Will I get
a bat nose like that?

138
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,169
Few vampires are cunning enough
to have lived this long.

139
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:00,419
Which you now demonstrate.

140
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:09,210
Naples. You and me, Darla.
What do you say?

141
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,320
Angelus.

142
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,580
This is no place for you,
bound to the likes of him.

143
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,809
You should show respect.

144
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,929
You belong by my side.
Out in the world...

145
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,110
...feeding as we like,
taking what we need.

146
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,940
I'll give you that view you crave.
I'll give you everything.

147
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,419
Tell the truth.

148
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,759
Whose face do you wanna
look at forever?

149
00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:50,919
His or mine?

150
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:54,620
Idiot. I made her.

151
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,000
You're leaving with
the stallion, aren't you?

152
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:27,730
No, let them go.

153
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:33,659
It won't last.
I give it a century, tops.

154
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:35,860
"Darla."

155
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:39,049
"Anglo-Saxon derivation,
meaning 'Dear one."'

156
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:44,159
Didn't come into common usage
until 100 years after her birth.

157
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:47,519
He must've given it to her.

158
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:53,340
I didn't even know her real name.

159
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:55,179
Any luck?

160
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,440
Not yet. Working on it.

161
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,620
- Something will come up.
- Yes, that's my fear.

162
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,490
Angel, your record pertaining
to Darla has been...

163
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,860
...spotty at best.

164
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,549
I killed her, Wesley, and she
came back. They brought her back.

165
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:17,909
I need to know why. Why human?

166
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:20,870
Perhaps that was the
only way they could hope...

167
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:24,610
...to control her
with any degree of success.

168
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:28,559
Angel, this might be why
they've brought her back.

169
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:34,070
You have all your attention focused
on finding this one woman.

170
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,610
They went through all this trouble
just to keep me distracted?

171
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,100
It is possible.
And if that's the case....

172
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:46,779
It's working.

173
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,340
Are you hungry?

174
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,559
I could grab some sandwiches
from the vending machine.

175
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,570
It's not exactly
gourmet cuisine, but--

176
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:16,179
Lindsey.

177
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,409
Holland.

178
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:20,029
Darla, how are you?

179
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,100
I'm fine, Holland. Good to see you.

180
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,120
Always a pleasure.
Lindsey, a word. You'll excuse us.

181
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:35,350
I'll be right outside.

182
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,139
I thought we were very clear on this,

183
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,690
She's made contact.
It's not prudent to have her here.

184
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:54,330
I know. I just didn't feel
I could leave her alone.

185
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,210
There's a problem.
She shows post-traumatic--

186
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,620
- She's cracking up.
- I wouldn't say that.

187
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,629
She's ahead of schedule.

188
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:09,259
- What?
- We'll have to accelerate matters.

189
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:12,679
But we're ready.
You did the right thing. Good work.

190
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,600
Don't let her leave here.

191
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:18,149
Oh, letter openers, staple guns,
even pens...

192
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:22,809
...you should remove
sharp items from your office.

193
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,809
So beautiful.
Not a blemish, not a freckle.

194
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,019
We should've preserved that beauty.

195
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,509
Still, he won't now age.

196
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:49,440
No, but he'll rot. Seems a pity.

197
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:53,950
When I bit into him,
I could hear the ocean.

198
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,289
Of course you could.

199
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:59,490
I'm full and warm, yet all alone.

200
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,970
- That's not true. You've got us.
- Not in the least.

201
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:06,940
You won't even hurt me just a bit.

202
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,480
- All you have to do is ask.
- No.

203
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,750
- He's too full of you, Grandmother.
- Stop calling me that.

204
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:17,529
Don't be cross. I could be your mommy.

205
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,210
Make yourself a playmate.

206
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:25,220
I could. I could pick the wisest and
bravest knight in all the land...

207
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:28,330
...and make him mine forever
with a kiss.

208
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,659
Watch where you're going!

209
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,230
Or you could take
the first idiot that comes along.

210
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:44,559
- Think she'll find a good one?
- I found you.

211
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,210
We think that the search is over.

212
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:51,200
- Property's owned by Wolfram & Hart.
- Annapolis.

213
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,129
- A Wolfram & Hart client.
- That's slim.

214
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,360
- It has a view.
- Not enough.

215
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,529
- And Berber carpets.
- Narrow it down further.

216
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,529
And my sister lives in unit 319.

217
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,450
- You don't have one.
- I do.

218
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:08,519
My older, way older, like 400 years...

219
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,809
...older, blond sister, Darla.

220
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,549
No last name.
I've been trying to find her...

221
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:18,869
...because Mom and Dad
are in the coma.

222
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:22,640
Sue, the property manager,
was very helpful.

223
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:25,859
She even cried.

224
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,519
Let's go.

225
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:35,240
Perhaps I should contact Gunn.
He and I could check this out.

226
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:38,599
We do the reconnaissance.

227
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,910
Then we can all decide
how to proceed, as a team.

228
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:44,430
Probably a good idea.

229
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,210
It's 1 p.m. and that's
a Sun Valley address.

230
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:50,009
Right.

231
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,789
- Sun.
- I was thinking Valley.

232
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:58,539
Why go there if you don't have to?

233
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,119
Darla.

234
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:14,970
Say that again?

235
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,849
I just....

236
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,220
I said your name, Darla.

237
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:24,599
Sounds so odd, doesn't it?

238
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:26,789
What do you mean?

239
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,920
It wasn't my name when I was human.

240
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,480
First time I was human, I mean.

241
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:37,309
What was your name?

242
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,690
I don't remember.

243
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:46,410
I'm not her, whoever she was.

244
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:49,829
I was Darla for so long.

245
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,700
Then I wasn't.

246
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,710
I wasn't anything. I just stopped.

247
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,160
He killed me, I was done.

248
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,160
Then you brought me back.

249
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:08,720
Yes.

250
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:10,700
What did you bring back?

251
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,819
What am I?

252
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:16,619
That girl whose name
I can't remember...

253
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,869
...or did you bring back
something else?

254
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,609
The other thing?

255
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:24,220
Both.

256
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,349
Neither. You're just you...

257
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:31,450
- ...whatever that is.
- Why haven't you kissed me?

258
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:35,009
You've been dying for it.

259
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,000
- I didn't know if you wanted me to.
- Should that matter?

260
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,339
Do you think I ever hesitate
when I want something?

261
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,180
Life's too short.

262
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,319
Believe me, I know.

263
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,839
Four hundred years,
and still too short.

264
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,940
That's how humans get what they want.
I remember that much.

265
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,390
Do you like it?

266
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,650
It's nice.

267
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,750
It's not me you wanna screw.

268
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,460
What?

269
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,579
It's him.

270
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,630
You all think you can use me
to get to Angel.

271
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:37,240
Maybe.

272
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:44,759
What am I?

273
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,140
I don't know, and I don't care.

274
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,279
- Now do you care?
- No.

275
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,599
That's how vampires get things.
What am I?

276
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,000
- Darla.
- Is that it? Am I Darla?

277
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,769
Yes.

278
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:07,019
Careful, Darla would snap you in half.
Is that who I am?

279
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:18,420
- I know what you're going through.
- No, nobody understands.

280
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,069
Nobody can understand.

281
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,809
I can feel this body dying, Lindsey.

282
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,349
I can feel it decaying every moment.

283
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,869
It's being eaten away
by this thing inside.

284
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:37,200
It's a cancer, this soul.

285
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:45,059
You took him from me. You stole him.

286
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:49,140
- You gave him a soul.
- He must suffer...

287
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,920
- ...as all his victims have.
- That is no justice.

288
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:55,819
Whatever pain he caused was momentary.

289
00:21:56,609 --> 00:21:58,289
Over in an instant...

290
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:00,759
...or an hour.

291
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:04,390
But what you've done will make
him suffer for eternity.

292
00:22:05,609 --> 00:22:08,700
Remove the filthy soul
so my boy might return to me.

293
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,910
Angelus has gone away. Where is he?

294
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:14,910
Drusilla, the camp.

295
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:17,490
Go on! Kill things.

296
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,329
He'll be very cross...

297
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:22,990
...if he finds we had a lovely
slaughter without him.

298
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:24,980
He'll join us soon.

299
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:27,799
Now do as you're told.

300
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,279
Okay.

301
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,930
In that wagon is your family.

302
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:38,980
Your family will die tonight
without my protection.

303
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:43,250
But if you do as I say,
your family can live.

304
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:48,480
What?

305
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:56,660
Pretty music. Pretty, pretty music.

306
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,880
They cry out for mercy.

307
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:04,039
- They cry out for mercy.
- Show none.

308
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:08,529
Did someone break in?

309
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:09,839
Well, us.

310
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,440
You guys did this? Real mature.

311
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:15,970
This is the way we found it.
No forced entry evident.

312
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:19,680
- Not till we got there.
- It seems she did this.

313
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:22,259
She smashed all the mirrors.

314
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,279
- Why?
- It's obvious.

315
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:26,309
- It's not.
- She feels the weight of her soul.

316
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,119
We don't know that.

317
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:32,309
- She was a vampire who now has a soul.
- So why don't you smash mirrors?

318
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:34,890
I don't have to look
at myself in them.

319
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,470
We have to find her.

320
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:39,339
- Angel--
- She needs help.

321
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:42,509
It might be what somebody
would like you to think.

322
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:45,019
- Angel.
- Cordy, just take a message.

323
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:46,789
So this is a setup?

324
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,339
- Don't rule it out.
- Angel!

325
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:50,529
Cordy, please, I'm talking.

326
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:53,599
Hi, Darla. He can't talk now.

327
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,380
He'll call you back
once he's found you.

328
00:23:56,609 --> 00:24:00,400
- Darla?
- My boy. My darling boy.

329
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:02,990
Where are you?

330
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:07,779
Better question: Where was I?
I don't remember anything.

331
00:24:08,609 --> 00:24:10,640
It's a great big nothing,

332
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:13,359
Could it be there's no hell?

333
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,549
There's a hell, I've been to one,

334
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,480
I told him no one could understand,

335
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:21,789
But I was wrong, wasn't I?
My boy knows.

336
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:25,430
- I know.
- You said you'd give me everything,

337
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:29,839
Do you remember that?
I believed it then.

338
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:32,250
I still do,

339
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:34,119
I'll do whatever I can.

340
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:38,450
It's been centuries since
I've had to be afraid.

341
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:41,700
- And now I'm sick with it.
- I know.

342
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:45,480
Angel.

343
00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:48,549
Darla, what are you doing?

344
00:24:50,009 --> 00:24:51,170
Help me.

345
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,099
- Just put down the phone,
- Darla?

346
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,740
Hang up the phone.

347
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:00,619
It's okay.

348
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,460
Darla?

349
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:06,269
It's okay. All right?
Just put it down.

350
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:09,369
- Everything okay?
- Yes, we're fine.

351
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:12,160
- Mr. Manners told me to--
- No, leave.

352
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,950
I have to go to him, Lindsey.

353
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:16,680
Don't say that.

354
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,369
Don't say that.

355
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:26,339
- He's the only one. He can help me.
- No. I can help you too.

356
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:31,000
No. No, you can't.
You don't have it in you. I'm sorry.

357
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:35,309
- Let's go to Mr. Manners' office.
- I'll handle this. Go.

358
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,210
- She's not leaving here.
- I said go!

359
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:42,170
Darla?

360
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:44,740
Darla?

361
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,480
- She's not leaving here,
- I said go!

362
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:00,480
Come on, let's go,
You gotta come with me,

363
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,240
You not only allowed her to escape,
you facilitated it.

364
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,029
Things were confusing.

365
00:26:12,849 --> 00:26:17,170
Things are often confusing for you.
Especially when it comes to her.

366
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,190
You allowed yourself
to be ruled by emotions.

367
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:25,789
What about the guard?

368
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:30,019
Family's been notified.
Police have a suspect in custody.

369
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,690
You're off this project.

370
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,619
- I can find her.
- We picked her up two blocks away.

371
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,460
She's safe?

372
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,980
- We won't discuss it further.
- If you think--

373
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,700
This situation has gone
out of control.

374
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,849
I'm terminating the project.

375
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:52,829
Terminating?

376
00:26:54,849 --> 00:26:58,289
Go home, Lindsey. Get some rest.

377
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,049
We'll start fresh tomorrow.

378
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:07,509
- Want me to come?
- I have to do this alone.

379
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:09,059
- Thanks.
- Angel.

380
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,319
I know, I could walk into a trap.

381
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,690
- I get that.
- You don't.

382
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,349
I can't turn my back.

383
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:18,589
No, you shouldn't.
You know what she was.

384
00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:21,829
What we were.
I know what she's going through.

385
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,400
Maybe she won't have to go
through it alone.

386
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:27,769
You're not alone.

387
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:33,019
You may be right.
She may experience this as you did.

388
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,200
You wandered for 100 years,
never seeking redemption.

389
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:38,740
That's right. I sought her.

390
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,380
You're so warm. You've just fed.

391
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,730
- You found me.
- You can't resist war.

392
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,569
You always talked about China.

393
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:16,279
I just followed the bodies.
You never used to be so careless.

394
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:18,869
Maybe I wanted to be found.

395
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:22,609
- Spike and Dru?
- They're here.

396
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,309
Probably out in the riots.

397
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,549
Maybe starting a new one.

398
00:28:30,529 --> 00:28:31,609
I should kill you.

399
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:35,210
- Go ahead.
- Is that why you've come?

400
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:39,480
Too much of a coward
to end your own existence?

401
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,920
Release that filthy soul?

402
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:44,000
If you like.

403
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:46,220
I can still smell it, you know.

404
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:48,589
That's not all.

405
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:53,029
You reek of vermin. Is that
what you've been living off of?

406
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,230
This should be nothing.

407
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,559
Go ahead, Darla.
Make sure you cut clean to the bone.

408
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:06,200
What do you want?

409
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:09,519
- A second chance.
- What?

410
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,759
I want things to be like they were.

411
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,549
You and me together.

412
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,380
Darla, I miss the view.

413
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:21,059
- It's impossible.
- It's not impossible.

414
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:23,740
- You have a soul.
- I'm still a vampire.

415
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:25,650
You're not.

416
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:28,720
I don't know what you are anymore.

417
00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:32,140
You know what I am.
You made me, Darla.

418
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,650
- I'm Angelus.
- Not anymore.

419
00:29:35,329 --> 00:29:38,559
I can be again.
Give me a chance to prove it to you.

420
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:43,430
You almost made me believe you.

421
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:46,779
Believe it.
We can have the whirlwind back.

422
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,829
- We can do this.
- Yes, we can.

423
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,619
- We can do anything.
- Anything we like.

424
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,849
Where is she?

425
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,400
- I was--
- No.

426
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,430
Just enough breath
to tell me where she is.

427
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:23,829
We help the helpless,

428
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:26,339
How can we help you? Hello?

429
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:28,349
I was trying to call you.

430
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:32,299
They'll kill her. Stop it.
She needs you, please.

431
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,809
- You're a liar.
- It's true!

432
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,359
Where?

433
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:41,150
In an abandoned bank.
Wolfram & Hart's property.

434
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:44,089
- I'm pretty sure that's where--
- Pretty sure?

435
00:30:45,089 --> 00:30:48,460
I'm not in the loop on this.
It's where they do that stuff.

436
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:51,039
Where the vaults used to be.

437
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:54,390
If this is a trick,
I'll come back for you.

438
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,630
I might be back for you anyway.

439
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:02,730
Darla?

440
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,150
Darla?

441
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,049
Darla.

442
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:13,420
Darla.

443
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,430
Angelus?

444
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:50,049
The whirlwind, Angelus.

445
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,890
- What's over here?
- Nothing.

446
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,960
Bodies. Let's find something warm.

447
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:05,410
Yes, some missionaries.

448
00:32:06,089 --> 00:32:08,369
We'll drain the piety
right out of them.

449
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:14,450
Where have you been?

450
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,180
- May I tell?
- No need to be humble.

451
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:21,990
My little Spike just killed
himself a slayer.

452
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:25,170
Did you hear that?

453
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,289
Congratulations.

454
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:30,009
That makes you one of us.

455
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,339
Don't be so glum, mate.

456
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,630
One slayer snuffs it,
another one rises.

457
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,980
There's a new Chosen One
getting chosen now.

458
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:43,019
When this new bird shows up,
I'll give you first crack at her.

459
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,819
I smell fear.

460
00:32:51,089 --> 00:32:52,910
This whole place reeks of it.

461
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:55,670
It's intoxicating.

462
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,309
Let's go. This rebellion's boring me.

463
00:33:48,089 --> 00:33:51,569
Are you with me, Angel?
Why aren't you with me?

464
00:33:57,089 --> 00:33:59,410
Sorry, lady. It's just us.

465
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:11,090
Where have you been?

466
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:12,650
Darla.

467
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,480
Answer me.

468
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:15,860
Just out. Why?

469
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,030
- Feeding?
- Yeah.

470
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,650
On vermin?

471
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:24,889
No.

472
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,519
- Don't lie to me.
- I've killed men. You've seen it.

473
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,690
Rapists and murderers.

474
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,469
Thieves and scoundrels.

475
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,539
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

476
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,960
Only evildoers,
that's all you hunt now.

477
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:49,059
You swore. You said if I took
you back, you'd prove yourself.

478
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,000
- And I will.
- Good.

479
00:34:53,809 --> 00:34:54,789
Now's your chance.

480
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,909
I went back before dawn.

481
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:05,340
They were still cowering there...

482
00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:08,300
...praying to their God for salvation.

483
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:11,550
But their only savior
was at the waterfront...

484
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,199
...dining on rats.

485
00:35:15,409 --> 00:35:17,619
I won't be made a fool, Angelus.

486
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:19,780
Not by you.

487
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,079
Not by anyone.

488
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:24,960
- I didn't mean--
- While Spike killed a slayer...

489
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:28,000
...you were saving missionaries.

490
00:35:29,809 --> 00:35:31,070
From me.

491
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:33,719
- I'm sorry.
- No.

492
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:37,320
No more words.

493
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,239
Act.

494
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,239
Darla?

495
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,539
Everything okay?

496
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,360
Family's been notified,

497
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:53,519
- Did you re-notify his family?
- Lindsey.

498
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,039
You played me, and her.

499
00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:56,980
- You had to believe it.
- Why?

500
00:36:57,769 --> 00:36:58,780
Because she had to believe it.

501
00:36:58,969 --> 00:37:01,710
Angel has to.
The crisis needed to be real.

502
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:05,239
You think she'll give him
that happiness?

503
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,420
He'll come on our side? Won't happen.

504
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,960
He'll never take advantage of her.

505
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,869
You don't understand him.

506
00:37:13,369 --> 00:37:16,989
There's no prospect for intimacy.
Don't torture yourself.

507
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:25,389
- What do you expect him to do?
- What he will do.

508
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,010
What he must do.

509
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:29,909
Save her soul.

510
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,559
She'll be okay.

511
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:35,710
Maybe we should get her a doctor.

512
00:37:36,849 --> 00:37:38,429
No doctors.

513
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:44,360
Angelus.

514
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:51,619
Sorry, I know you're Concussion Gal,
but around here it's Angel.

515
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:54,909
Just Angel, okay?

516
00:37:55,449 --> 00:37:58,679
Guys, you mind?
Just give us a minute.

517
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,210
- Yeah, of course.
- No problem.

518
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,949
Thought I was dead.

519
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:11,920
You're not dead.

520
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:15,730
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

521
00:38:16,449 --> 00:38:17,960
I know what you mean.

522
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:27,300
I'm so lucky to have
someone who understands.

523
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,449
Who knows.

524
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,210
That's something you never had.

525
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,969
- Wasn't your fault.
- No, no.

526
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,329
But there's so much that is.

527
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,989
It's gonna be okay.

528
00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:53,570
I knew you'd help me.

529
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,809
I knew if I could only get to you....

530
00:38:57,849 --> 00:39:00,130
Funny, that's why
they brought me back.

531
00:39:01,449 --> 00:39:02,960
To get to you.

532
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:08,449
Now I find I need you
just as I've always needed you.

533
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:15,590
You'll make the pain stop, won't you?

534
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,420
Takes time.

535
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,840
It takes moments.

536
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,309
Do it.

537
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:26,639
Now.

538
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,309
What?

539
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:32,219
Make me what I was.

540
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,710
- Darla--
- You said you'd help me.

541
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:38,110
I will.

542
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:41,780
I want to. But not like this.

543
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,460
Turn me back. My God!

544
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,480
I can't bear this pounding chest
for another instant!

545
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:54,769
It's a gift.

546
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,389
To feel that heart beat...

547
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:03,969
...to know really and for once
that you're alive.

548
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:09,579
You're human again, Darla.
You know what that means?

549
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,539
Of course I do.

550
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:17,739
It means pain and suffering
and disease and death.

551
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:23,519
I released you from this world once.
I gave you eternal life.

552
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,320
It's time to return the favor.

553
00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:38,610
Favor?

554
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:42,949
Is that what you think?

555
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,300
You think you did me a favor?

556
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,250
You damned me.

557
00:40:57,849 --> 00:41:01,780
If it's such a punishment,
take out your revenge. Pay me back.

558
00:41:07,449 --> 00:41:08,639
Please.

559
00:41:13,449 --> 00:41:14,849
I can't.

560
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:21,099
What do you mean, you can't?

561
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:23,360
You won't.

562
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:27,239
I can't seem to be what I'm not.

563
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:29,920
I'm sorry.

564
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,610
You disgust me.

565
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,039
- Darla, wait.
- No!

566
00:41:46,449 --> 00:41:48,309
Don't look for me again.

567
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,510
Thank you,
