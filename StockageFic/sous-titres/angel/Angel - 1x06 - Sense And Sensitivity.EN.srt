1
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,439
Sorry, I guess I have a problem
expressing myself verbally.

2
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,500
I struggle with it.

3
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:38,939
You stood me up.

4
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:41,829
You were gonna come to
the station, remember?

5
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,140
I forgot?

6
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,850
Not something a girl likes to hear.

7
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,719
So we'll skip the informal invitation
and do the more formal thing.

8
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,310
You have the right to remain silent,
but I wouldn't recommend it.

9
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,560
Look at the pictures.
I looked at them.

10
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,890
- What's in the pictures?
- Me and Little Tony.

11
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:04,420
I don't know where he is.
How long are we gonna do this?

12
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,340
So you haven't seen him since
the day this picture was taken?

13
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,340
The day County Supervisor Caffrey
was found murdered.

14
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:16,780
I heard it was a suicide.

15
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,629
Caffrey shot himself?

16
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:22,530
- It happens.
- In back of the head?

17
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,599
And he locked himself
in the trunk of his car?

18
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,109
He'd been depressed.

19
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,269
Where's Little Tony?

20
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,280
Burbank. Stockholm. The planet
Mongo. I have no idea where he is!

21
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,890
Losing patience with this crap.

22
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,810
I'm not. I'm just getting started.

23
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,060
I had a big breakfast.
I could do this all day.

24
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,930
Doesn't she ever have to pee?

25
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,560
Fine. You want to play all day,
play with yourself.

26
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,189
You charge me or get me gone
because I'm telling you nothing.

27
00:01:58,329 --> 00:01:59,730
Look at the pictures.

28
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,780
Bite me.

29
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,540
Where is he?

30
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,859
Kate, Kate.

31
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,280
- Sorry.
- Yeah, well...

32
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,539
...we should've gotten
you out hours ago.

33
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,840
- He's not gonna talk.
- Then Little Tony is good as gone.

34
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,439
We can't find him,
then I don't know anyone who can.

35
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:41,770
It's about time!

36
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,639
Not a lot of enchanted
swordsmiths open on Sunday.

37
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,210
Cut off all limbs and both heads.

38
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,689
Remember to bury the parts separately.
I don't want it coming back to life.

39
00:02:57,729 --> 00:02:58,889
That's it?

40
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:03,389
I'm gonna go clean out the nests.
I'll see you back at the office.

41
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,229
Am I wrong in thinking that
a "please" and "thank you"...

42
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,250
...is generally considered good form
when requesting a dismemberment?

43
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,469
He appreciates us in his
own unappreciative way.

44
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,300
You know what I think?

45
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:24,919
I think he uses his tortured
creature-of-the-night status...

46
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,400
...as license to be
rude and insensitive.

47
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,719
Sure, he's polite to
the helpless and downtrodden.

48
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,090
But he ignores the people that are
closest to him, who matter the most.

49
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,039
Can you say "clueless"?

50
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:29,569
Does giant tentacle spew
come out with dry cleaning?

51
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,459
- Good, you're back. You need to--
- No!

52
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:37,720
I don't care what's about to happen.
Asteroids are hurtling towards Earth.

53
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:41,459
Unspeakable evil is rising in
the San Fernando Valley.

54
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:44,459
Jar Jar is getting his
own talk show. Whatever.

55
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,199
I don't want to hear about it.
Not until you ask us how it went.

56
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,050
Call your mom back. She phoned,
saying she'd like to speak with you.

57
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:54,949
And what are you talking about?

58
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,370
You do remember leaving us in
a sewer with a giant calamari?

59
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:03,129
Yeah, and you're both here,
so I assume it went okay, right?

60
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,579
Yeah, it went okay. Of
course it went okay. Okay?

61
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:11,110
- That's not the point!
- So there is a point?

62
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:16,149
It is possible to brood and show
interest in the feelings of others.

63
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,610
She thinks you're insensitive,
and not to bring up the irony...

64
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,769
...but consider the source.

65
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,069
I'm reserved. I do care.

66
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:30,170
- It's like you don't have a pulse.
- I don't.

67
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:33,310
Spend a little time listening to
how the living interact.

68
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,029
- Kate.
- Angel.

69
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:38,779
- Got a minute?
- Sure.

70
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:43,370
- Coffee?
- I'm fine.

71
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:53,110
Mr. and Mrs. Spock
need to mind meld now.

72
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:58,860
His name's Tony Papazian. Street
name, Little Tony. He's a bad guy.

73
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:02,779
We have an indictment against him
for a county supervisor's murder.

74
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:06,560
One problem: We don't know
where to send the subpoena.

75
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:07,939
You can't find him.

76
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:11,319
He's still in the city,
but all my sources are dry.

77
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:15,629
- Want me to look into it?
- I'll pay for whatever you can get.

78
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,639
- I owe you a favor--
- This isn't a favor.

79
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,009
It's a job. That's how we do it.

80
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:23,250
- This number is my direct line.
- All right.

81
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:25,550
Time's a factor.
Tony plans to skip town.

82
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:26,959
Got it.

83
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,980
Find him, you call me. Nothing more.
You cannot be a part of this.

84
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,370
You don't want a reputation for
going outside the department?

85
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:38,000
I don't want to get a reputation
for getting you killed.

86
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:52,800
Anything?

87
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:55,689
Plenty on Papazian.
Known acquaintances, hangouts.

88
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,839
But the cops have
already been over all this.

89
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,279
Yeah, but we haven't.

90
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:07,040
Cordelia, I wanted to, you know,
thank you so much...

91
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:10,509
...for going through
those coroner reports...

92
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:15,269
...because I can imagine how
not fun it is to read about...

93
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:18,350
...you know, coroner stuff.

94
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,889
Lame.

95
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:25,300
- What do you got?
- The weebies.

96
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,769
This guy clearly has
anger management issues.

97
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,170
Victims and victim parts washing up...

98
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:33,589
...all over the
Southern California Coast.

99
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:37,230
Long Beach, San Pedro, Carlsbad.

100
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,209
Pull up the tidal flow charts.

101
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:42,490
- Match them up to the murder dates.
- Tides?

102
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:45,100
You think this guy has a
primary dumping ground?

103
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:47,540
Do the victims come
from the same spot?

104
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,079
Somewhere Little Tony feels safe.

105
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,120
- Daddy.
- Katie!

106
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:58,550
I saw you. Were you
planning on saying hi?

107
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,529
Well, I figured you're working.

108
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,180
I'm not here very long, just dropping
off some pension forms up in records.

109
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:09,879
If you think you got red tape
on the job, wait'll you retire.

110
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,189
Harlan says they're throwing you
a sendoff at the Blue Bar.

111
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,790
Just the guys looking to give
me a hard time, not a big deal.

112
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:21,040
He said I should say something,
just a few words...

113
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:24,110
...to mark the occasion,
seeing as you're my father.

114
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,480
That'd be fine.

115
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,649
Don't go to any trouble.

116
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:31,910
It's no trouble, really.

117
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,940
- Detective, you got a call on 229.
- Thanks.

118
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,269
- I guess I'd better....
- Yeah.

119
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:49,519
Lockley.

120
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,000
8843 Hyperion Way,
right off pier 39, San Pedro.

121
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:55,950
You found him, You're sure?

122
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,350
Mack's Salvage Depot, northwest side.
Got some muscle on hand.

123
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm on my way.
Just get out of there.

124
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:27,139
Damn it.

125
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,049
- And don't forget to water my plants.
- Sure thing.

126
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,259
And talk to them.
They like that.

127
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:44,159
Hi.

128
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,620
This is exciting.
I love boat trips.

129
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,850
- Who's the mook?
- Herb Saunders.

130
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:51,460
- It's Herb Saunders.
- The freeways here.

131
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:54,320
I've been driving all day,
but the brochure did say:

132
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,470
"Boats leaving every two hours."

133
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,799
I think you're still lost.

134
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:00,360
- Is that to Catalina?
- No.

135
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:02,720
I could've sworn
the ticket said pier 39.

136
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,409
It's here, I had it.

137
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:07,059
- Get out of here.
- Benny, I don't like that guy.

138
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:09,629
Is it the hat?
I knew it was too much.

139
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:18,570
Hi, Tony.

140
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:34,129
Which part of "Get out of there"
gave you trouble?

141
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:36,000
He was getting away.

142
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,090
So you dressed like a road flare
and put my ass and yours on the line?

143
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,840
Look, just go. I'll figure out
something to tell my lieutenant.

144
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,169
I want my phone call.

145
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:08,429
Gotta cancel the suite in Yerevan?
Think you can get your deposit back?

146
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,330
You've been running after me for a
long time, haven't you, sweetheart?

147
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,450
If I'd known how bad you wanted me,
I might've had you catch me sooner.

148
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:21,629
If I knew how much you
needed the exercise...

149
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:24,070
...I might've let you
run a little longer.

150
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,309
- Wolfram and Hart,
- Lee Mercer,

151
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:35,639
Yes, Mr. Papazian, we're already
well aware of the situation.

152
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,679
And are you aware I got
a certain thorn in my side?

153
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,350
Oh, yes, we understand
the factors very clearly.

154
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:46,690
And I think I can say with confidence,
that thorn is about to be removed.

155
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,730
Permanently.

156
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:56,259
Here is our petition to transfer
our client out of this precinct.

157
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,879
- What for?
- For his own safety, lieutenant.

158
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,490
Afraid to stay with us?
Need a nightlight?

159
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,309
You got a pretty mouth.
Hate to see it get broken.

160
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,889
I want that stricken.

161
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:09,429
He's under great stress
from abuse suffered...

162
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,220
...at the hands of your officers and
an unnamed assailant...

163
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:15,750
...we believe was with
Detective Lockley at the arrest.

164
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:18,500
- I wouldn't know.
- I saw you talking to him.

165
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,940
Before or after you
murdered Caffrey, you fat--

166
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,600
- That's enough.
- Enter her verbal abuse in the record.

167
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:26,870
That too.

168
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,690
Mr. Papazian's rights
will be respected--

169
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,159
Mr. Papazian is a
very important client.

170
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,970
Any violation of his rights
and there will be repercussions.

171
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,529
- What does that mean?
- I'll open the case to public opinion.

172
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:42,389
We'll shine a light
on this precinct...

173
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:45,679
...and give people a view of the
brutality of the police...

174
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,039
...that'll make Mark Fuhrman
look like Gentle Ben.

175
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,179
Everybody should have
a lawyer like this one.

176
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,990
How nice is it to finally have a
simple find-the-crime-lord case?

177
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:00,750
Over and done with.

178
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,470
Yeah.

179
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,610
Wait. You've got pensive face.

180
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,620
- I've always got pensive face.
- "Pensiv-er" face.

181
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,370
I'm not sure this is over with.

182
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,049
- There's something about Little Tony.
- What something?

183
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:21,149
I don't know, just a feeling I got.

184
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:26,299
- What?
- Nothing.

185
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,750
I just find it fascinating how your
instincts are so highly attuned...

186
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,169
...when it comes to boring old evil,
but you have yet to make mention...

187
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:36,539
...of these new shoes.

188
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,659
Look, Cordelia, women's shoes--
Men, they just don't--

189
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,889
Great shoes. New?

190
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:48,289
You were right.
He's planning something.

191
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,360
- What'd you hear?
- Papazian's planning something.

192
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,940
- That's it?
- Johnny Red says, quote:

193
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,190
- "Papazian's planning something."
- I thought so.

194
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,350
You were right.

195
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:03,080
- Home run, Lockley.
- Way to go.

196
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,450
Nice work, Lockley.

197
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:08,970
No, your dad paid for the drink.

198
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:16,000
Tony Papazian, huh?

199
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,190
Yeah.

200
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:22,450
- Well, congratulations.
- Thanks.

201
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,330
Hope the bust doesn't fall apart
before you file the paperwork.

202
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,019
Damn lawyers, huh?

203
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:30,860
Yeah.

204
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,639
- Harlan.
- You see this?

205
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:41,690
- Sensitivity training?
- Everyone has to take it.

206
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:44,690
It's because of what
you did to Papazian.

207
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:47,059
What I did?

208
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:49,419
Somebody's gonna answer for this.

209
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,279
- Will they make us hug?
- I'm not hugging you.

210
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,470
Glad I'm getting out. In my day,
we didn't need any damn sensitivity.

211
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,730
I'm guessing not too many of
you want to be here right now.

212
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:05,129
Quick show of hands.
Who actually wants to be here?

213
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,559
Well, I'm not gonna waste your time.

214
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,629
What I am gonna do
is give you some tools...

215
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,539
...to help you experience
the full range of human emotions.

216
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:18,009
Learning that won't just
make you better people...

217
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:22,129
...it'll help you diffuse
volatile situations in the field.

218
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,169
It'll allow you to manage
some of your aggression...

219
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,610
...so you won't feel
so tired all the time.

220
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,659
In short, it'll make you better cops.

221
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:36,179
One of the tools we use is this.

222
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,049
It's called a Talking Stick.
I know, it sounds silly.

223
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,909
But it works if you give it a chance.

224
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:47,440
It's our contract with each other.

225
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:52,980
Whoever holds this has the freedom
to express himself completely...

226
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:57,570
...without judgment, within
the confines of this room.

227
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,659
Heath?

228
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:06,009
- I don't think so.
- Go ahead, give it a try.

229
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:14,259
Now, why don't you start by telling
us something about your family?

230
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:17,440
How you grew up. Any siblings?

231
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:20,159
- Six brothers.
- And what was that like?

232
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:22,600
I learned to hit back pretty quick.

233
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:27,220
Your brothers went
kind of hard on you, huh?

234
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,120
Where were your parents?

235
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:33,679
It was just my mom.
She did the best she could.

236
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,460
So you had to get tough right out of
the gate. Shut down your emotions.

237
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:45,529
It's okay. You have our
permission to be honest.

238
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,690
Is there something that you always
wanted to say to your mother...

239
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:52,779
...but never could?

240
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:56,620
"Will you marry me?"

241
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:09,250
Kate, you'd like to share
something? We'd like to hear it.

242
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:12,289
- No, I don't really.
- Afraid?

243
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:22,200
Genuine emotion makes you
uncomfortable. That's okay.

244
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,940
Your inappropriate
sarcasm masks anger.

245
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,619
And do you know what anger is, Kate?

246
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:33,119
It's just fear.

247
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,779
Fear of being hurt. Fear of loss.

248
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:42,140
You've been hurt, haven't you, Kate?
And you're afraid of being hurt again.

249
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:45,259
Who are you afraid is gonna hurt you?

250
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,190
Hell if I know,

251
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,750
But you told me you
heard something, right?

252
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,480
Planning something,
that's all I heard.

253
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:57,349
And who'd you hear it from?

254
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,559
Guys who work for Little Tony.
They're in my spinning class.

255
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,049
- What did they say?
- They weren't actually talking to me.

256
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:07,230
They were talking to some
guys in Brancato's crew.

257
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:10,759
I overheard on account of
they had to shout over the bikes.

258
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,660
- And all these guys are at your gym?
- Yeah.

259
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,339
You got some kind of
thug special there?

260
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:19,369
No, but if you want to
sign up, I get a discount.

261
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:21,700
Look, guys. What was said?

262
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,369
Right. Izzy's boys, they say to
Little Tony's crew...

263
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,869
...now LT's in jail, they gotta
look for new employment.

264
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:33,380
But LT's guys say no, because no stupid
bitch is gonna get the best of LT.

265
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,019
- Know what that means?
- I think it stands for "Little Tony."

266
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:39,319
It means he's going after Kate.

267
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:46,809
- Angel.
- We need to talk.

268
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:49,130
I know. I want to
apologize for the other night.

269
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:50,720
You don't have to.

270
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:53,109
That's not what my
sensitivity trainer says.

271
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:58,079
I know, it's pretty goofball, right?
Still, thanks for what you did.

272
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:00,880
You're welcome.

273
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,559
What are you doing tomorrow
night, around 8-ish?

274
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,720
My father's having this retirement
party with some of his cop buddies.

275
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,269
I'm supposed to say a few words.

276
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:14,849
It'd be nice if there was at least
one person there who wasn't armed.

277
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,609
It'd be a favor.

278
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:19,730
Sure.

279
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:23,039
Okay, that was easy. I'm relieved.

280
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:25,589
Is something wrong?

281
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:29,390
- I think you may be in real danger.
- Okay, the relief part's done.

282
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:33,869
I don't know the specifics yet, but
Papazian took a contract out on you.

283
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:38,069
- Wow, he's really acting out.
- Well, yeah.

284
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:40,660
- He wants you dead.
- I get that.

285
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,740
I'm just saying he must be in pain
to strike out at others in that way.

286
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:47,400
- Are you okay?
- God, listen to me.

287
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:49,210
Suddenly I'm Dr. Laura.

288
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,809
Soon I'll be talking
about my inner child.

289
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:56,609
I'll be back to my usual level
of cynicism in no time.

290
00:19:57,609 --> 00:20:00,700
I'm sensing some tension.
I think you should tell me.

291
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,490
What are you feeling?

292
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,539
Concerned.

293
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:09,029
We went to great effort and expense
to get you into that precinct.

294
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,720
- Is it working?
- Of course it's working.

295
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:19,579
After tomorrow's session,
you'll see results.

296
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:24,700
Incredible results.

297
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:29,220
That makes me feel all warm inside.

298
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:36,180
That is so true, man!

299
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,769
Boy, I'm scared.

300
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:54,069
And excited.
And consumed with dread.

301
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,750
And glad you're here.

302
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:01,059
Little Tony's hired guns wouldn't
try something in a room of cops.

303
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:02,900
Oh, that death threat overhead.

304
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,650
No, I meant speaking in public.

305
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,990
What's that old saw? Picture your
audience in their underwear?

306
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,119
Way ahead of you.

307
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,369
Happy retirement, Daddy.

308
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,930
- See you later.
- Who's this?

309
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,640
My friend Angel.
Angel, this is my father.

310
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,130
Hello. Congratulations.

311
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,190
For what? All I did was live
this long and not get shot.

312
00:21:27,089 --> 00:21:28,980
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?

313
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,880
Pretend important things don't matter.

314
00:21:33,089 --> 00:21:36,279
So, Angel, how long you
been seeing Katie?

315
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:38,900
We're pretty new friends.

316
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,670
Good to see her out with a man.

317
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:44,440
I was starting to wonder
if she leaned in another direction.

318
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:50,079
All right, everyone, before we cut
the cake, the other Officer Lockley...

319
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:53,930
...the good-looking one, wants
to say a few words. Kate?

320
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,259
Hi, everybody.

321
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,750
Welcome to the end of an era.

322
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:14,410
The old man wants us to
believe he could care less...

323
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,579
...about all this attention
and free booze.

324
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:21,180
But I know him better than that.

325
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:26,150
He put a lot of years in on the job
and made a difference in many lives.

326
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:33,279
And now it's over. It's a huge deal,
no matter what he says.

327
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,119
In fact, I don't know what
he's gonna do with himself.

328
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,470
He forgot how to be anything
but a cop a long time ago.

329
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:45,950
And maybe that's why
I became a cop too.

330
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:54,390
After Mom died, you stopped, you know.

331
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,839
It was like you couldn't
stand the sight of me.

332
00:23:00,089 --> 00:23:02,480
Her face, her eyes looking up at you.

333
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,420
But big girls don't cry, right?

334
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:12,809
You said, "Gone's gone and
there's no use wallowing."

335
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:16,170
Worms and dirt and nothing, forever.

336
00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:20,299
Not one word about a better place.

337
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,750
You couldn't even tell a
scared little girl a beautiful lie.

338
00:23:33,089 --> 00:23:36,710
God, I wanted to drink with you.
I wanted you to laugh once with me...

339
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,519
...the way you laughed with
Jimmy here or Frank.

340
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,410
What the hell did they do to her
in that class?

341
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,430
My best friend, Joanne?

342
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:54,460
Her mom was soft and she smelled
like macaroni and cheese.

343
00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:59,859
And she would pick me up
on her lap and she'd rock me.

344
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:05,259
She said she wanted to
keep me for herself...

345
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,650
...that I was good and sweet.

346
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,920
Everybody said I was.

347
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:18,599
Do you realize that you have
never told me that I'm pretty?

348
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:20,940
Not once in my life.

349
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:23,660
Keep going, Katie.

350
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:26,119
Well, I can't anymore, Dad.

351
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:30,140
I can't campaign for the office
of your beloved daughter.

352
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:35,259
You closed your heart after
Mom left us and that's it!

353
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:43,029
- That was so damn brave.
- Are you kidding me?

354
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:44,869
This wasn't the forum.

355
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,410
She can't worry about protecting him.

356
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:50,859
Let it out. I always knew
your mother was controlling.

357
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,619
- I'm passive-aggressive?
- I hear denial.

358
00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:55,809
She abused the process.

359
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,920
You're completely blocked!

360
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,750
Your need for catharsis
isn't the issue!

361
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:02,450
I'll give you catharsis.

362
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:14,509
For God's sake, Jimmy.
Keep it together, will you?

363
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:17,549
I'll take him to his precinct
to sleep it off with the drunks.

364
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:19,769
You should do likewise.

365
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,559
Come on, let's go.

366
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:29,240
All right, I'm here.
What's the big emergency?

367
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,440
Because these late hours are eating
into my potential social life.

368
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,309
Why I ever thought it was a nifty idea
to work for a ventriloquist--

369
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,230
- Hi.
- Hi.

370
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:42,059
Drink this.

371
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:49,539
You have the most intense eyes.
I see such an old soul.

372
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,029
He gets that a lot.

373
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,740
I thought that enigmatic thing
was an act to get women.

374
00:25:54,849 --> 00:25:57,970
The truth is, you don't have
an insincere bone in your body.

375
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:01,220
Tell me about the sensitivity
training. Who's running it?

376
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:04,609
You want to go?
It's pretty wonderful.

377
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:05,920
Gets you where you live.

378
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,160
I need to know his name.

379
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:10,539
We all need so much.

380
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:13,440
What's her deal? Too much...?

381
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,470
- Thumb-sucking?
- Alcohol, dummy.

382
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:17,849
Don't look at me.

383
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,089
I'm not the one that needs to
brush up on her finger pantomime.

384
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,519
Something to do with
training she had at work.

385
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,809
Someone's got a crush.

386
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,349
- What?
- It's right there.

387
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,920
How he feels about you.
You don't know what to do about it.

388
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,140
Please. We just joke around.

389
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,440
Where is the truth?
Where is the truth?

390
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:49,509
He's hiding behind Mr. Humor.

391
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,940
I mean, look at Doyle. Really look
at him. What do you see?

392
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:57,380
A bad double poly blend?

393
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,079
That's defense, Cordelia.

394
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:03,230
Maybe you should try to open
your heart to a new possibility.

395
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,339
- She's starting to make sense--
- Angel!

396
00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:08,569
I got his address, 322 Fletcher.

397
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:11,460
What aren't you telling me, Angel?

398
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:14,180
I'm glad we came to watch
late Night With Creepy Cop,

399
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,809
Stay with her while I find this guy.
Don't let her out of your sight.

400
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,579
What's going on here?

401
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,920
That's a good question, Allen.

402
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:28,900
Can we get you some coffee?
Or Valium? Or both?

403
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,829
He walked out on me.
He just walked out.

404
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,200
He'll be back.

405
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:36,349
Not Angel. My father.

406
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,049
Oh.

407
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,640
- I have to find him.
- Maybe you should hold off for now.

408
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:44,259
- Angel said we should wait.
- I hear you.

409
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:46,240
But I need to find my dad.

410
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,420
Detective, you're not yourself.

411
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:50,680
- Why don't we all just--?
- Help each other?

412
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:52,019
By staying here.

413
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:54,210
We could, but I have this...

414
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:55,869
Personal problem?

415
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,369
...gun. I don't want
to seem insensitive, but...

416
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:01,160
...if either of you try to stop me,
I'll blow you away...

417
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:03,529
...because I'm gonna find my dad.

418
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:09,630
Which demon do you worship?
Which one gives you your power?

419
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,309
A whole bunch, actually.
I'm a polytheist.

420
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,720
I'm not here to play games.

421
00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:17,109
You have rage. I get that.

422
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:20,039
- What did you do to Kate?
- Do you know what anger is?

423
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,549
- It's fear.
- I know what fear is.

424
00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:24,740
- I can smell it right now.
- That's good.

425
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,740
Give yourself permission to open up.

426
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,140
What were your parents like?

427
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,289
My parents were great.

428
00:29:33,609 --> 00:29:35,289
Tasted a lot like chicken.

429
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,400
Why don't you talk?

430
00:29:39,609 --> 00:29:41,569
Sorry I was insensitive, George.

431
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:44,750
- Listen, I'm having an epiphany.
- It's not right.

432
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:49,259
Trapped together that way.
The big ones picking on the weak ones.

433
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,960
It's not right. Makes them more
brutal than when they came in.

434
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:48,380
Remember this, brothers.
An act of kindness is just as manly--

435
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,059
Dad? Daddy?

436
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,740
Whiplash?
I'll tell you about whiplash.

437
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,789
I've got emotional whiplash from
dealing with people like you each day.

438
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,849
If anyone's the victim, it's me!
I've alienated my friends, my family.

439
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:19,049
My own children are afraid of me.
I can't even make love to my wife.

440
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:24,380
I hear you. I don't think you're
listening to your mugger's feelings.

441
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,369
Wait, wait, wait!

442
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:31,410
- What are you--?
- We followed Kate.

443
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:34,230
She's lost it. She looked
ready to do some damage.

444
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,440
- And it's not just her.
- The whole place is going nuts.

445
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:39,319
This is so not good.

446
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,660
Okay, I think someone needs a hug.

447
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,329
Hey, what's your damage?

448
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,720
I think he just found
Mr. Sensitivity.

449
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,859
He was in here all the time,
waiting to come out.

450
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,970
Gosh, what our folks do to us.

451
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,650
Please, Daddy, if you're there,
pick up. We need to talk.

452
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:10,299
Daddy!

453
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:14,109
He put the whammy on you!
You stink with whammy.

454
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,920
She's right.

455
00:32:17,089 --> 00:32:18,460
Talking Stick, it's cursed.

456
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,750
There's a stick that talks?

457
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:24,309
Cordelia, do you have any idea
just how precious you are?

458
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:27,099
All right, let's just
talk about the stick.

459
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:31,220
He uses it as a talisman. Anyone
who handles it becomes infected.

460
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:36,369
He admitted it to me after I
threatened him with physical violence.

461
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:38,960
What's his trip?

462
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,700
Wolfram and Hart hired
this guy to neutralize the police...

463
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,329
...so Little Tony could escape.

464
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,019
- It'll wear off.
- Soon?

465
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,240
So no contract on Detective Lockley.

466
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:52,119
Little Tony's plan all along was to
kill her himself. Poor guy.

467
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:54,880
- Poor guy?
- Well, he's got issues.

468
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,890
Angel, snap out of this!

469
00:32:57,289 --> 00:33:01,150
Right now! It's time for you to get
all vampy. Kate needs you!

470
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:07,329
I don't want to. You both withdraw
when I go vamp. I feel you judge me.

471
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:11,460
We won't judge you.
Will we? Give it a try.

472
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:14,039
Closeness is too important to me now.

473
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:17,950
- Angel, man, Kate is in there!
- Along with killer guy!

474
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,269
- We're closed.
- You're the police!

475
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,099
- You can't close!
- Why not?

476
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,009
Haven't we done enough?

477
00:33:29,089 --> 00:33:33,660
It's always "find this, rescue that"
with you people. See how you like it.

478
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,150
I wanted to express my regret for
having treated you so shabbily.

479
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:45,130
So I composed a poem about it:
"I saw a leaf, and I did cry...."

480
00:33:48,289 --> 00:33:49,660
It hurts, doesn't it?

481
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:52,369
When people don't listen?
When they reject you?

482
00:33:53,089 --> 00:33:55,049
- You know?
- I ought to.

483
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:58,859
For two years, I've been saying
to you, "Love me, Kate.

484
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:01,829
Need me the way I need you."

485
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:05,880
But you never notice.
Never return my desire.

486
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:10,929
You just sit at that desk next to
mine, smelling the way you do...

487
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,880
...taunting me.

488
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:18,730
You guys, you're working for Little
Tony now. You'll find I'm stern...

489
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,019
...but fair. Now come on,
let's go kill us a lady cop.

490
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:29,309
- We need a rock.
- I'm not comfortable with this.

491
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,059
Don't argue.
This is the only way in.

492
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,849
Here, this one should do it.

493
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:37,969
- Aim for the window!
- I was!

494
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:39,130
Give me that.

495
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,289
Nice arm.

496
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:45,159
Angel, now it's your turn. Come on!

497
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,920
Come on! Let's go.

498
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,989
Wow. That's vandalism.

499
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,039
We'll take care of it later.

500
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:07,570
- We should leave a note.
- Would you come on!

501
00:35:07,969 --> 00:35:09,369
- What's the magic word?
- Urgh!

502
00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:11,099
I don't think "urgh" is it...

503
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,050
...if one would call it a word and
even so, certainly not a magic one.

504
00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:18,440
- We don't have time!
- There's always time to be considerate.

505
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:23,090
- Oh, please.
- See? That wasn't so hard, was it?

506
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,269
Thought you finally had it over on me?

507
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:32,800
Thought you were smarter
than Little Tony?

508
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:36,719
Nobody beats me, baby,
not even a stone bitch like you.

509
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:40,039
I am not a bitch!
I'm just protected.

510
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:42,650
- No one protecting you now.
- Hey!

511
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:48,579
I feel serious negative
energy in this room.

512
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:51,190
Go on, take care of him.

513
00:35:51,769 --> 00:35:53,519
I've been wanting to see you again.

514
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:56,590
I'm sure he'd say the same,
but that gun makes you seem hostile.

515
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:59,130
That and the body language.
It's so closed.

516
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:02,630
- Yeah.
- Angel, man, fight. Don't talk!

517
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,079
We are so dead.

518
00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:08,340
Now, why don't we all just sit down
together and process this?

519
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:13,530
Seems that sensitivity training I
paid for really took, Nancy-boy.

520
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,920
How do you think that makes me feel?

521
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:26,559
Okay, now I'm feeling unheard.

522
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:35,690
You know, Anthony, you can be
a rainbow and not a...

523
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:39,480
..."pain-bow."

524
00:36:40,969 --> 00:36:42,860
I mean, it really is all up to you.

525
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,250
You.

526
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,469
No, you.

527
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:51,940
Come here.

528
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:58,179
Anyone for vomit?

529
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:05,559
It's so sad, isn't it?

530
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:08,170
Some people just really need
to live in the problem.

531
00:37:13,969 --> 00:37:14,980
What do I pay you for?

532
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,730
Where the hell are you?
I want my limo here now!

533
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,769
That's not possible, Mr. Papazian.

534
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,610
What? What are you telling me?

535
00:37:22,969 --> 00:37:26,480
You attempted to murder a police
officer in full view of witnesses.

536
00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:30,719
- We can't risk exposure,
- You're the one set this thing up!

537
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:32,380
We opened a door for you,

538
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:35,099
You were to walk through it,
not blast your way out.

539
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:39,010
The senior partners feel you're a
liability, We can't waste...

540
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,099
...energy when there are
pressing issues.

541
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:44,900
- What pressing issues?
- Our relationship is terminated.

542
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:47,070
As is this phone call.

543
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,619
- Morning.
- Yeah, right.

544
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,119
- How do you feel?
- Pretty foolish. You?

545
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,280
I'm all right.

546
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:05,079
Internal Affairs is investigating the
Blue Bar. Someone spiked the punch.

547
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:09,210
Seems like everyone went a little
crazy. I know I did with my dad.

548
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,760
Well, maybe it helped.

549
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,530
Did I...?
Did I say anything to you?

550
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:18,809
I'm a little fuzzy myself.

551
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,260
Good.

552
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:24,599
- Well, I should get back to work.
- Yeah, me too.

553
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,969
- Hi.
- Katie.

554
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,690
- Got your messages on my machine.
- That was kind of a bizarre night--

555
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:45,460
Katie...

556
00:38:47,449 --> 00:38:48,849
...don't say anything.

557
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:54,699
You make an idiot of yourself,
embarrass me in front of the guys.

558
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,760
You don't bring that up ever again.
Far as I'm concerned...

559
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,130
...it didn't happen.
