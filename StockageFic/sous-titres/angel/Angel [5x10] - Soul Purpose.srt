170
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:39,392
From what I hear, Angel didn't
save the girl on his first mission.

171
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:41,989
What's Angel got to do with this?

172
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,830
Well, nothin'.

173
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:46,837
Not anymore.

174
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:50,839
<i>- I know how these people think.</i>
- And I know what we have in our arsenal, Charles.

175
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:53,343
Guys, I can hear you
out in the lobby.

176
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,345
The week's lab reports, Angel.

177
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:58,007
Fred, doesn't the Wolfram and Hart satellite
have lethal capability?

178
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,014
What?

179
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:02,280
Couldn't we eliminate a target
from the air untraceably?

180
00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:06,619
Well, we do have an orbital-range
microwave cannon up there.

181
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:10,217
<i>Focuses the satellite's communication</i>
<i>signals into a pinpoint beam.</i>

182
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:15,096
It can raise the temperature of the targeted
area 1,000 degrees in less than five seconds.

183
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,691
So, yeah, in theory we could.

184
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:20,294
That is, if we did that sort of thing.

185
00:11:20,405 --> 00:11:23,806
- Do we do that sort of thing?
<i>- [Wesley] It might be the thing to do.</i>

- What?

189
00:11:35,754 --> 00:11:38,655
Warlocks, minions...
they're all evil.

- Yes, but...

192
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,226
Well, why don't we?
Let's get back to the basics.

193
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,892
Good versus evil.
Offing the monsters where we find them.

194
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:52,402
We have to tread light here.
We can't afford to...

show it to me now.

Fair enough.

256
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:47,136
Senior partners
are very interested in this.

257
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:51,699
I don't know what it is, to be honest.
I get the sense that they don't either.

258
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:55,405
They must suspect it's powerful. They're
chomping at the bit to learn whatever they can.

I'll take care of it, Harmony.

266
00:16:11,696 --> 00:16:16,395
Also, anytime anything comes in with runes
on it, I'm supposed to tell Angel immediately.

267
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:19,402
And not try and read the runes myself.

Are you sure Team Angel

I mean, he hasn't sewn a big red "S"
on his chest yet, but he's getting there.

We keep building him up
while we tear Angel down.

493
00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:11,877
Pretty soon the senior partners are gonna
start thinking they're backing the wrong horse.

494
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:15,607
Unless they find out
we're fixing the race.

Not while you have
these pretty pictures.

500
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:40,239
These aren't for playing.

501
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,208
They're the only thing keeping me
off Wolfram and Hart's radar.

502
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,108
That doesn't mean
I can't think they're sexy.

Oh, you can think whatever you want...
after we finish our project.

504
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:55,119
That mean you're gonna give me
what I want?

505
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:58,156
Or are you gonna
keep up the teasing all day?

506
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:06,123
Good girls
