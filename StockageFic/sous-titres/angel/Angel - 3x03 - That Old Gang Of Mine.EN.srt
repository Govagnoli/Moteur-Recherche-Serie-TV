1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:02,910
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:04,740
We've heard you do favors for Angel.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,130
That's all I know, man, I swear.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,650
The Host reads their souls,
senses their futures.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,359
He can only do it
when they sing karaoke.

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,870
I wanna find those kids.
They don't have homes.

7
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:21,780
If they're hunting vampires,
they'll get themselves killed.

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,829
- You should have waited for me.
- We been waiting for months.

9
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,530
Get dressed and get out.

10
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:43,840
The next time I see you,
I will have to kill you.

11
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:48,329
That night still haunts me.

12
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:52,070
I'm ashamed of how I treated you.

13
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:55,320
The way I used you.

14
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,479
I took what I needed
and then I cast you aside.

15
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,459
And that was wrong of me.
It was very wrong.

16
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:12,010
He's reading!

17
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:16,349
- I made some notes.
- I don't feel the sincerity here.

18
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,840
- This was a waste of time.
- Friends don't need notes.

19
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,760
We're not friends, Merl.
We barely even know each other.

20
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:26,549
Not like you made
the effort either, is it?

21
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,340
No. Let him go if he wants to.

22
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,579
- You said you'd listen to Angel.
- You promised you'd try.

23
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:36,920
- Did you hear that insincere tripe?
- It's unfair to blame the writing.

24
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,420
- What does he want from me?
- What do I want?

25
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,500
I'll tell you what I want. I want back
the three months I spent in therapy...

26
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:48,859
...after being hung
upside down in a sewer.

27
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:50,870
Angel, read the cards.

28
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,280
No, he's.... He's right. He's right.

29
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,370
Every time I went to Merl for
information, he came through.

30
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:04,060
So I'll tell you what, Merl.
Take a shot. Take a shot, Merl.

31
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:06,260
- Knock it off, guys!
- Come on.

32
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,919
- You see this? He's goading.
- You know you want to.

33
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,650
- Take a shot.
- Shameless with the goading.

34
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:14,939
- Come on, Merl.
- Do you see this? Fine.

35
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:17,030
Okay!

36
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,500
Man, you did that on purpose.

37
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:24,569
He knew that was gonna happen.
You tricked me.

38
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,539
I'm sure Angel just forgot that demon
violence is impossible in Caritas.

39
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:31,460
Yeah, I forgot.

40
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,509
Yeah, whatever, okay.

41
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:37,840
I'm done listening to this bloodsucker
and that goes for the rest of you.

42
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:42,500
I never want to see
any of you ever again!

43
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:47,900
Uh.... So who's giving me
a ride home?

44
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:57,710
Thanks. I hope I didn't take you...

45
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,819
...too far out of your way.

46
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:11,590
What the...?

47
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:14,520
No, no, no, no!.

48
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:13,939
Hey, big brother.

49
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:19,540
I was supposed to protect you.
You were my sister.

50
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,629
I still am.

51
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,149
Goodbye.

52
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,269
Alonna!

53
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,769
You made it.

54
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,240
I called the hotel. Cordelia said
you were at Merl's. What is that?

55
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,310
- That's Merl.
- Where's the rest of him?

56
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,810
Nasty. What happened?

57
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:08,529
I don't know. I came to give "sincere"
one more shot. Even brought doughnuts.

58
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:12,060
But this is what I found.
We've ruled out suicide.

59
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,519
Found some of his personal
papers and address book.

60
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:19,189
Gunn, you're here. Good.

61
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,129
You didn't notice anything odd
when you dropped Merl off, did you?

62
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:26,930
Not really.

63
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:31,079
We'll box these up, catalogue them
when we get back to the hotel.

64
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,269
Hey, guys, what are we doing?

65
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,160
- Examining the crime scene.
- I see that. What's our interest?

66
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,860
- Someone killed Merl.
- No, right, I get that.

67
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,819
I didn't have a beef with Merl.
I'm even sorry he got dead.

68
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,470
But is this what we should spend
our time on? He was what he was.

69
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,129
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

70
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,220
Somebody killed a demon.
Hello? We do that every day.

71
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:02,819
- Merl was harmless.
- Okay.

72
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:05,990
You' re not bent because
we interrupted something?

73
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,860
- No.
- Okay.

74
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,310
Usually doesn't take you
two hours to answer a page.

75
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,019
Did somebody put you back in charge?
They forgot to tell me.

76
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,139
All right.

77
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,350
Gunn, if this isn't something
you can get behind, we'll understand.

78
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,819
For now, why don't you
just go on home?

79
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:31,810
Go home.

80
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,430
You know what?
That's probably a real good idea.

81
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:41,410
Little creep.

82
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,899
- Angel.
- Merl.

83
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:48,240
He was right. I never bothered
to get to know who he was.

84
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,819
Now I guess I'll have to.

85
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,779
This is a situation
you might wanna rethink.

86
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:31,000
- Nice rig.
- Glad you like it.

87
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,629
He should. He built it.

88
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,220
Gio, you wanna get that thing
out of my boy's face?

89
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:42,410
You're still passing along
what I taught you.

90
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,480
Word's out. Vamps know better
than to even cross Venice Boulevard.

91
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:50,189
Crew's as tight as it's ever been.
Even in your day.

92
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,800
- Charles Gunn?
- That's right.

93
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:58,410
I know all about you. That name is
part of the reason I came out here.

94
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:01,459
- Gio's from Miami.
- Coast-to-coast, huh?

95
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,290
Something like that.

96
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:06,959
You might be able to help me out.
Why is it...

97
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,730
...that places like L.A. and Miami
bring out the teeth?

98
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:14,439
You'd think vamps would want
to hang in less sunny climes...

99
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,410
- ...know what I'm saying?
- I think I do.

100
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,500
- Maybe we could ask your boss why.
- Yo, Gio.

101
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,819
You can't beat them, right, Chuck?

102
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:27,540
- It ain't even like that.
- No?

103
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,910
Okay. If you say so.

104
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,820
See, because I heard...

105
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,110
...that you was this
bigtime alpha vamp killer...

106
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,440
...and now you working with one.
What's up with that?

107
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:49,090
Gio, who's supposed
to be on point out back?

108
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,649
- That'd be me.
- So why ain't you back there?

109
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,210
Yeah, all right, it's cool.
Y'all can have your nice little visit.

110
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:08,679
But you might want to do that outside,
in the sunshine.

111
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:12,039
Just to be on the safe side, you know?

112
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,100
Some people just need
a little time alone.

113
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,159
She's had time alone. Five years.
I think that's the problem.

114
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:26,830
She's been back three months,
and she hasn't gone out.

115
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:31,200
It's not like the last time she was
out, she got sucked into a portal...

116
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:36,350
...and ended up living like a hunted
animal in a demon alterna-world.

117
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,549
Wait. Kind of is, isn't it?

118
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:41,899
Which is why I'm asking you
to, you know, talk to her.

119
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:44,690
- That's not a great idea.
- You don't like her?

120
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:48,080
Sure, I like her. What's not to like?

121
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:49,950
She's sweet and adorable...

122
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:54,250
...and seems to be laughing
at something that shrub said.

123
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:57,429
It's not that I don't like her.
I just don't get her.

124
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:02,149
I'm not asking you to get her.
I'm just asking you to...

125
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:04,639
...talk to her.

126
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,750
Fine. We'll chat.

127
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,190
Thanks.

128
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,940
- What's this?
- "Enemies of Merl" list.

129
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,929
Hey, why is my name
at the top of this list?

130
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:25,570
Uh, A?

131
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,330
- Merl and I were not enemies.
- Oh, okay. My mistake.

132
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:31,740
I found the body, remember?

133
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,240
Oh, and that's not suspicious.

134
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,909
The one time you pay Merl
a social visit, he ends up dead.

135
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:40,700
I recognize many of these names.

136
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,789
You should. They weren't enemies
until we made him snitch on them.

137
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:48,460
Oh, sure. I went dark,
and I killed Merl.

138
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,700
We'll work backwards.
End with the A's. How's that?

139
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,840
We should start tracking
these names.

140
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:59,129
Ask yourself this:

141
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:03,139
If I had killed Merl,
would I have brought doughnuts?

142
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:09,070
I guess that's the word on me
now, huh? Traitor, vamp lover?

143
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:12,220
Don't listen to Gio.
He don't know you.

144
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:16,340
You do. You think I turned my back
on y'all to hook up with one of them?

145
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:21,289
I ain't seen your back.
I don't know which way it's facing.

146
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:24,919
- That's no answer.
- Truth? I ain't heard a word from you.

147
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,889
Not since we spread what was left
of George in the river.

148
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:34,340
I didn't mean to disappear on y'all.
I didn't plan it.

149
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,440
- I guess after George--
- You were gone way before George.

150
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:44,190
It was Alonna, man. Things, they
were never the same after Alonna.

151
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:48,250
I couldn't keep my own sister safe.
What could I do for you?

152
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:53,360
You done a lot. People are alive
because of something you started.

153
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:57,220
No, man. Something we started.

154
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,690
Got that right.

155
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,580
What's this one?

156
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:10,059
Samuel Larch, a bookie.
Merl owed him a lot of money.

157
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,840
- Demon or human?
- I'm not sure.

158
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:18,080
Care to find out?

159
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:22,740
Demon, then.

160
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:33,600
I think when we find whatever's
doing this, we're gonna need Gunn.

161
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:37,730
I agree. From the look of this,
what we're up against is...

162
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,840
...quite big, extremely powerful--

163
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:43,909
And really pissed off.

164
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:02,019
Hello? Who's there, please?

165
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,559
Get him!

166
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:07,460
Come on!

167
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,659
Smoke him, Gio!

168
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:42,500
- Gunn.
- Hey.

169
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,389
Got your page. Where's Angel?

170
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,639
He's checking on something else.
Come in.

171
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:54,809
Victim's name was Samuel Larch.
We found him last night.

172
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:57,009
- Guy was a demon.
- Yeah.

173
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:00,330
Wesley?

174
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,950
What are we doing, man?
Who we working for anyway?

175
00:14:04,289 --> 00:14:07,309
Did The Powers send us here?
Did Cordy get a vision?

176
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,429
- No.
- Then what?

177
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:17,049
Things are not always so simple
as just slaying the big bad ugly.

178
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,100
- There are shades of gray.
- Yeah.

179
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:24,350
And green and a sickly yellow and
sometimes puce with horns. I get it.

180
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:29,820
What I don't get is why we are playing
cleanup crew to a bunch of demons.

181
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:34,269
So we bust our butts till we find
whatever did Merl and this Larch guy.

182
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,629
And six other victims we linked to it.

183
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:40,210
So we find this demon killing machine.
What then?

184
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:43,590
We gonna stop it or thank it?

185
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:45,710
I don't know.

186
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:48,289
You don't know.

187
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,679
From all I can determine,
this victim was assimilated.

188
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,690
No history of violence,
no threat to anyone.

189
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:01,409
Two of the others would have
to be classified as irredeemably evil.

190
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:03,220
What are you saying?

191
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,730
Whatever's responsible for these
attacks isn't making distinctions.

192
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,259
It's just killing, randomly.

193
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,980
- You were right. Happened again.
- When?

194
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,490
Last night. A Yarbnie was
eviscerated in a sewer, Century City.

195
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:23,259
- Yarbie? What's that?
- Yarbnie. A balancing entity.

196
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:28,129
They tend to nest in urban areas
under roadways. Utterly nonviolent.

197
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:33,700
I should hit the streets. See if I can
shake anything loose. If you want.

198
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:38,049
- Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
- Cool. I'm on it.

199
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,590
- Hey.
- Hey.

200
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:53,220
Explain this. It was dug out of the
wall of an apartment on Miracle Mile.

201
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,000
Yeah, so?

202
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:58,769
I recognize it. It's out of my old rig,
the one your pal Gio's been using.

203
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,500
Okay.

204
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:04,450
I came to give you a heads up.
You got a rogue on your crew.

205
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,909
Gio's been killing anything that moves.
You got to have a sit-down with him.

206
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:11,940
This ain't how we do things.

207
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,830
You dug this out of an apartment
on the Mile?

208
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,669
- Yes.
- Tall white towers?

209
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:19,210
This is funny. Gio ain't no rogue.

210
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:23,259
He found the place, but we was
all there. The whole crew.

211
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,529
- You?
- Brother, the thing wasn't human.

212
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:29,830
We took care of it.

213
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,419
- But did it attack anybody?
- No. We got away clean.

214
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:38,149
- No, I mean before you broke in.
- We didn't give it a chance to.

215
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,220
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

216
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,850
Yo, Rondell. Everyone's here, man.

217
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:48,539
You guys packing heat now?

218
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,009
You can never be too careful.
I gotta go.

219
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:55,590
Wanna come with us tonight? Gio
says he found a nest. Primo hunting.

220
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,029
No, man, I got something.

221
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,860
Be good.

222
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:10,759
Hey. You know something? He still
thinks you're some kind of hero.

223
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,900
But me and you, we know better, right?

224
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,420
Yeah. Yeah, we know better.

225
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,259
Come on, let's go.

226
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:38,140
I haven't any idea what this might be.
It doesn't fit any of the data.

227
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,990
- Something's missing.
- Maybe it's never been recorded.

228
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:46,569
Don't tell me another portal's opened.
We have enough monsters in L.A.

229
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:50,740
No, something's missing.
We're missing an evidence bag.

230
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:53,670
Seven. Eight. Nine.

231
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,299
Yes, here's 10, here's 12, but...

232
00:17:57,569 --> 00:17:59,890
...where's 11? What was 11?

233
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:06,240
- Hi.
- Ha!

234
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:08,599
- You startled me.
- I'm sorry.

235
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,200
- No, it's my fault. I'm sorry, okay?
- Yeah.

236
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:18,579
- Well, I'll get out of your way.
- No, Fred, I want you to stay. Stay.

237
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:24,650
Actually, I was hoping
we could, you know, talk.

238
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,470
Well, yeah, of course.

239
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,240
- Did you mean now?
- Yes.

240
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:42,660
I'm sorry. It's just that
I feel a little awkward.

241
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,799
Angel wants you to get out.

242
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:52,049
Oh, I see.

243
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,119
No, I understand.
I only have a few things to pack.

244
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:58,609
- It won't take long.
- That's not what I meant.

245
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:02,599
Out into the real world. You know,
just for an evening or something.

246
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,849
Oh. Oh. Oh.

247
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,960
Not by yourself or anything.
What if we went out together?

248
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:20,240
Well, I suppose I would be okay
if I was with you, right?

249
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,130
Sure.

250
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,720
- I mean, that'd be safe, right?
- Of course it would.

251
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:28,900
No one would look at me
twice with you around.

252
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,670
Exactly!

253
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,579
No. Now, that's just not true.
People will notice you.

254
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:37,829
- They will?
- Yes. And you know why?

255
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:42,789
Because you'll be standing on a stage
in the white-hot spotlight.

256
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:45,490
I will?

257
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:28,170
- Hey.
Hey.

258
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,700
- You the only one here?
- Yeah.

259
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:34,369
You making any progress?

260
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:38,980
I don't know. Maybe. Wesley thinks
the crimes have been random.

261
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:41,710
- I'm starting to think otherwise.
- Oh?

262
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:46,609
The way it's happening, it reminds me
of things I've seen before.

263
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:50,289
How so?

264
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:53,920
The pattern. The seeming
randomness of it. The chaos.

265
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,660
There's a larger purpose
behind every move.

266
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,680
What?

267
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:02,039
To have fun.

268
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:08,359
Something wrong?

269
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:13,109
No. Just need to see the boss.
Know where he's at?

270
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:32,809
I swear to God,
she picked out the song herself.

271
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,869
I know what you're doing, and don't.

272
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:04,829
Stop it. Do not.

273
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:07,369
Hey! Don't go reading me.

274
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:12,089
I wouldn't.
But, sweetie, you're a billboard.

275
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:17,990
He came in with some questions.
Looks like you got the answers.

276
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:20,670
I really don't feel
like going over there.

277
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:24,660
So you wanna talk about it?

278
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,430
Do I gotta sing?

279
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:35,150
Go!

280
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:54,420
Party!

281
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,569
My club!

282
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,220
I thought demon violence
was impossible in here.

283
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,210
Those aren't demons.

284
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:28,240
That's time! Let's truck!

285
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:33,490
Whoa, don't be in such a rush, now.
Don't be in such a hurry.

286
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:38,049
You're liable to miss out on
the more interesting things in life.

287
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,109
Yo! Charlie Gunn!

288
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,890
Come on, now. I know you in here.
Where you at?

289
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,519
I'm right here.

290
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:57,710
G-Man, what are you doing here?

291
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,329
Come on, tell him.

292
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,990
Tell him how you been
rolling up in here for months...

293
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,700
...tossing back drinks
with your demon buddies.

294
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:14,549
What he's saying, that ain't true.

295
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:19,509
Why not? His best friend's a vampire.
What did you expect?

296
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:25,829
Rondell, go.
Just take your crew and leave.

297
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,420
No. Not until I get some answers.

298
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,730
That's right. Answers.
The man wants some answers.

299
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,029
Yes, I think we all would.

300
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:35,970
- Wesley.
- Stay out of this.

301
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:40,170
As much as I'd like to,
I'm afraid I'm in it. We all are.

302
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:47,259
- Get your hands off me.
- Hey!

303
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,859
- That's enough!
- Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

304
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,849
- I don't believe this.
- He's okay, man.

305
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:57,750
- Nice.
- He ain't okay. Look at him!

306
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:01,410
- You don't know what you're doing.
- It was them.

307
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,519
They killed Merl and the others.

308
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,619
You knew.

309
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:19,700
I should have said something.
I was going to. I was just....

310
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:24,039
I was trying to work it out.
Figure how to deal.

311
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,200
- Have you worked it out yet?
- I'm sorry.

312
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,279
You gonna apologize to this thing?

313
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:29,799
- Move.
- You might wanna.

314
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,500
You can't do that, man.
I can't let you.

315
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,789
- You lost the mission, bro.
- What?

316
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,890
What you been doing,
this ain't right.

317
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:46,099
- This is not what we're about.
- The hell you say.

318
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,069
I don't know what you're about,
but we been protecting our own.

319
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:54,809
Is it protecting your own to break
into people's homes?

320
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:58,619
- They ain't people. Are you?
- Stop!

321
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,480
Stop it.

322
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:08,039
I'd prefer a clean kill. The last time
I was wounded, it took months to heal.

323
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:11,789
Wounded, if I recall,
in an attempt to help you.

324
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:14,650
Look at me. Look at me!

325
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,240
It's got nothing to do with them, man.
This is between us. Us.

326
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,259
Let them go, man.

327
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,599
Yeah, why not? We can do that.

328
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:28,309
After all, we ain't monsters.

329
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,890
Take my truck. It's outside.
They won't stop you.

330
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:41,039
How can you be here with these
things and tell me I lost the mission?

331
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:44,190
Because it's true.

332
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,740
We used to face death
because we had to.

333
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,910
Now you chase it down for fun.
That ain't right.

334
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:52,809
One!

335
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:56,299
Just one. Her. She can go.
The others stay.

336
00:26:57,089 --> 00:26:58,029
Come on, man.

337
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:02,150
I'm not leaving here without her.
No way.

338
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:05,829
No! No.

339
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,420
The rest will be able to leave
after she brings back the vampire.

340
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:16,029
Then we'll see who lost the mission.

341
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:31,869
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

342
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:35,750
Shut up! He ain't listening.

343
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:42,559
We have to think of a better plan.
This is a bad plan. It's their plan.

344
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,059
They want you where you can't fight
so they can kill you.

345
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,789
- No choice.
- It'll be suicide.

346
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:51,279
- It'll be okay.
- It won't. You didn't see these guys.

347
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,039
- Go to this address.
- What is it?

348
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,720
- Transuding Furies.
- Gesundheit,

349
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:59,119
Lorne hires them to cast
a sanctorium spell on Caritas.

350
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,769
Tell them to lift the spell,
then I can fight back.

351
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:06,380
They'll lift the spell, then you can
fight all 20 and still get killed.

352
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,190
Cordy, please, just do it.

353
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,359
- What if they won't lift the spell?
- Tell them it's for me.

354
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:13,349
- You know them?
- I did.

355
00:28:13,849 --> 00:28:15,289
- They'll remember you?
- They should.

356
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,670
They better! Angel.

357
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,180
I told her she'd be safe with me.

358
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,329
I know.

359
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:47,079
We've gotta do something.
They'll kill Angel.

360
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,569
No, they won't.
They're gonna make me do it.

361
00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:57,430
Hey, Chuck!

362
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:02,109
Did I ever tell you you're my--
Hey.

363
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:21,660
I'm starting to think
this vamp ain't gonna show.

364
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,660
Miami.

365
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:28,609
Did you say something to me,
green boy?

366
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:33,579
Was 3000 miles really
far enough, I wonder?

367
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:36,839
I know why you left.

368
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,980
Why you ran.

369
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:49,460
You couldn't stay there, could you?
After what you did.

370
00:29:51,849 --> 00:29:55,039
- She trusted you.
- Shut up.

371
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,599
Right up until the end,
she trusted you. Did you know that?

372
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,779
Hey, that one's trying to run!

373
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,599
Oh, God. They'll kill us all.

374
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,349
I told you to watch the door!

375
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,529
You see that? You see that?!

376
00:30:36,849 --> 00:30:39,660
He's trying to save that lowlife.

377
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:46,890
Know what this thing does?
It's a baby killer.

378
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:49,819
I seen plenty of them in Florida.

379
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:58,359
- You like to eat babies, don't you?
- Yeah, go ahead. I don't care.

380
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:03,759
Think I care? Go ahead
and do it, cowards. Cowards.

381
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:09,720
So who does he go after?
Who does he draw down on?

382
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:14,140
The baby-killing monster? Nope, me.
What does that tell you?

383
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,789
There's a lot of monsters
to choose from.

384
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,789
And maybe you one of them.

385
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:23,420
You one of them, Chuck?
They turn you already?

386
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,970
Come at me and find out.

387
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,720
Yeah, I think he's one of them.

388
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:31,750
Or maybe you just want to be.

389
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:38,049
Yeah, that's more like it.

390
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:41,210
I bet they won't even let you
in their little club.

391
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:46,990
You ain't good enough for the vamps,
demons and baby-eating monsters.

392
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,230
That's what I'm guessing.

393
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:52,859
Buy them drinks, wine them
and dine them, stick up for them.

394
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:57,509
"Oh, yeah, that one's okay. "
And they still won't put you on.

395
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,099
- Ain't that a blip?
- Shut up.

396
00:32:00,849 --> 00:32:03,549
What we heard about
his sister might not be right.

397
00:32:03,849 --> 00:32:07,289
He was the only one there to see it.
Know what I'm saying?

398
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,400
I'll taste your children.

399
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:13,779
You the one let her
get vamped, right, Chuck?

400
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:17,769
I wouldn't let no bloodsucker
get that close to my sister.

401
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,420
- And why?
- I live in playgrounds.

402
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:24,579
Were you thinking that finally
she was gonna give it up to you?

403
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,819
Was that the plan?
And that's why you let her get bit.

404
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,720
--bodies. Leave them for a husk.

405
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:35,839
And then when she was there,
all vamped out and hungry...

406
00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:39,690
...you thought you might
get that eternal kiss.

407
00:32:39,849 --> 00:32:43,259
And when she said, "No,"
that's when you stuck it to her.

408
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:46,609
- Shut up!
- Not in here. No.

409
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:51,509
Are you trucking with vamps and
demons to get a piece of that action?

410
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:55,079
I said shut up!

411
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:01,450
- This is a sanctuary.
- Not anymore.

412
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,779
Nice shot.

413
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,309
Am I next?

414
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,759
Now's your chance, G.

415
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:17,289
Prove to everyone here this thing...

416
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:23,650
...ain't no friend to you.

417
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,930
This is madness. Angel has a soul.

418
00:33:27,329 --> 00:33:28,869
- He's a vampire.
- With a soul!

419
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,400
Whatever. You think that
makes him the same as us?

420
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,680
No, better.
Better than you, anyway.

421
00:33:36,329 --> 00:33:39,279
When he did his pleasure-killing,
he had no soul.

422
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:42,910
You can make no such claim.

423
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:45,779
What's it gonna be?

424
00:33:54,329 --> 00:33:58,539
Here, Charles.
Let me make it simple for you.

425
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,740
Take a look. This is what I am.

426
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:11,179
Deal with it or don't,
but make a damn choice.

427
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:20,820
So Angel says that
you and he go way back?

428
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,929
Mmm.... Angel.

429
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:30,380
So about the sanctorium mojo
you've got going on at Caritas....

430
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:35,780
Any chance you can pull the plug
on that? Kind of an emergency.

431
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,949
- You would have us...
- ...lift what...

432
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:40,239
- ...has been put in...
- ...place by mutual...

433
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,139
- ...consent...
- ...and contract.

434
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,900
If you don't, Angel will die.

435
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,789
Mmm.... Angel.

436
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,210
It's not gonna happen.

437
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,849
- I knew it.
- You don't know nothing.

438
00:34:59,449 --> 00:35:02,679
You think I won't kill him
because he's my friend?

439
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,650
That ain't why.

440
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:09,139
Truth is, he could
never be my friend...

441
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,449
...on account of what he is.

442
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:14,260
Not his fault really.
It's the way it worked out.

443
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:18,739
He ain't your friend. I am.
You're gonna choose that over me?

444
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,000
Looks like.

445
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,579
It's about the mission, bro.

446
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,960
- He's got it, and you don't.
- Oh.

447
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:32,500
You think 'cause you letting
that monster live you got the mission?

448
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:37,789
As far as I can see, a monster lover
ain't no better than a monster.

449
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:41,639
And I kill monsters.
That's what I do.

450
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:48,269
So anybody want to walk
out of here tonight...

451
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,039
...they gonna have to show me.

452
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,909
Come on, step on up
and do what your friend wouldn't.

453
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,230
Kill the vampire,
and you can leave this place.

454
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:00,739
Otherwise...

455
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,480
...stay and burn
with the rest of them.

456
00:36:08,449 --> 00:36:10,980
Who wants to live?

457
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,650
I'm sorry.

458
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:28,579
I just....
I don't want to die.

459
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,730
Look, this is really urgent.

460
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:45,239
I know Lorne pays you for this
spell. What will it take to lift it?

461
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,119
- This is not a debt...
- ...you can pay.

462
00:36:47,449 --> 00:36:48,849
You don't know that.

463
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,320
My credit has been good this year.

464
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,409
- Only Angel...
- ...is equipped...

465
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:54,460
...to pay this debt.

466
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,880
Angel?

467
00:36:56,449 --> 00:37:01,789
For a guy a couple of centuries old,
not very big with the wise investing.

468
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:06,489
And when you say "equipped,"
that isn't what you mean, is it?

469
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:11,429
- Mmm.... Angel.
- Got it. And, ew.

470
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:17,550
I'm sorry.

471
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,750
I just can't die in here.

472
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,670
It's okay. I understand.

473
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:32,300
All right, now you want to get it
in the heart, or it's no good.

474
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:40,739
I thought I might shoot you
in the throat instead.

475
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,440
If I pierce a carotid artery,
considering the temperature...

476
00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:48,469
...because someone shot the thermostat,
the blood loss will be heavy.

477
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,460
There's a chance I'll puncture
a vocal chord and you won't scream.

478
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:57,500
You'll want to when the blood loss
results in a cerebrovascular event.

479
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,199
That's a stroke.
I wasn't trying to sound snooty.

480
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,659
Fred.

481
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:10,769
Fred, it's okay.
Just point it at me. At me, Fred.

482
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:13,570
No, I can't.

483
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:17,300
Yes, you can. It's okay. Really.

484
00:38:23,849 --> 00:38:25,880
Thank you, ladies. I owe you one.

485
00:38:27,449 --> 00:38:29,590
Come on, you guys! Take these fools!

486
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,969
Fight! It's ten against three!
This is pathetic.

487
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,929
I'm done with you!
Why did I come to this coast?!

488
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,750
L.A. sucks!
I'm going back to Florida.

489
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:45,289
If you're lucky, I'll drag you on
the beach for sunshine, and totally--

490
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:14,570
Don't guess Rondell will cross
Venice Boulevard again soon.

491
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:17,400
It's never easy.

492
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,820
The pull of divided loyalties.

493
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:25,610
Whatever choice we make, we feel
as though we've betrayed someone.

494
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,170
Yeah.

495
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:34,750
If you withhold information or attempt
to subvert me again, I will fire you.

496
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:39,769
I can't have any member of this team
compromising the safety of the group.

497
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:44,500
If you do it again, you will be
dismissed, bag and baggage.

498
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:04,059
You're gonna get on me
about what I said.

499
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:05,929
No.

500
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:09,099
You understand, I had to stall.
Keep it going.

501
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:10,449
I get that.

502
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:15,659
- Doesn't mean I meant it.
- You meant it, but that's okay.

503
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,650
Can't help the way I feel, man.
Just the way it is.

504
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:24,030
Doesn't mean I don't want to work
with you or I don't like you.

505
00:40:24,929 --> 00:40:26,820
Maybe someday. I don't know.

506
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:30,630
I don't know either.
But I got time.

507
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,239
Hey.

508
00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:44,809
No matter what else, I proved you
could trust me when I didn't kill you.

509
00:40:45,929 --> 00:40:50,139
You'll prove I can trust you when the
day comes that you have to kill me...

510
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,380
...and you do.
