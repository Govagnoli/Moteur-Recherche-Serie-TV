1
00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:03,351
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Previously on Angel.</i>

2
00:00:06,964 --> 00:00:09,364
Who are you?

3
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:12,197
<i>[Woman] This is to confirm</i>
<i>that you have been rescued by Angel...</i>

4
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:14,533
C.E.O. And president
of Wolfram and Hart.

5
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:17,072
- You run a law firm?
- Well, just lately.

6
00:00:17,174 --> 00:00:20,109
- Why on earth are we here?
- What, because we're crusaders against evil...

7
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:23,339
and now the law firm that represents
most of the evil in the world...

8
00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:25,779
has given us its L.A. Branch
to run however we want?

9
00:00:25,883 --> 00:00:27,373
We're turnin'
this place inside out.

10
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,079
Yes, it's perfect. It's the project
you've been waiting for.

11
00:00:30,187 --> 00:00:33,054
Yeah, it's <i>Joanie Loves Chachi</i> meets
<i>The Sorrow And The Pity.</i>

12
00:00:33,157 --> 00:00:35,717
- Harmony.
- Hey, boss.

13
00:00:35,826 --> 00:00:38,226
- You're my secretary?
<i>- [Fred] Have you seen my lab?</i>

14
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,320
<i>It's giganamous.</i>
<i>And I'm in charge.</i>

15
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:42,661
I'm just wondering
if you're ready for the next step.

16
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:44,758
You don't know me,
or you wouldn't ask that question.

17
00:00:46,904 --> 00:00:49,065
<i>[Eve] Charles agreed to let us</i>
<i>enhance his mind...</i>

18
00:00:49,173 --> 00:00:50,834
with a comprehensive
knowledge of the law.

19
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:52,841
We're gonna change things.

20
00:00:52,943 --> 00:00:55,912
We came to Wolfram and Hart
because it's a powerful weapon.

21
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:57,913
<i>We'll deal with</i>
<i>whatever comes next.</i>

22
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:07,785
[Screaming]

23
00:01:07,892 --> 00:01:10,622
Spike.

24
00:01:10,728 --> 00:01:12,753
Spike.

25
00:01:30,414 --> 00:01:34,282
- Go on, then.
- No, you've done enough. You could still...

26
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,320
No. You've beaten 'em back.
It's for me to do the cleanup.

27
00:01:40,157 --> 00:01:42,022
- Spike.
- I mean it. I gotta do this.

28
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:56,029
Now, go.

29
00:01:59,143 --> 00:02:01,077
I want to see how it ends.

30
00:02:05,716 --> 00:02:07,877
[Laughing]

31
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:15,014
[Gasps]

32
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:22,356
What? What?

33
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:24,991
What the hell are
you doing here, Spike?

34
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:26,831
- Harmony, please.
<i>- [Gunn] This is Spike?</i>

35
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:28,598
<i>- The</i> Spike?
- Wait a minute, who's...

36
00:02:28,706 --> 00:02:31,038
<i>Easy, slim, easy.</i>
<i>No one's gonna hurt you.</i>

37
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:32,574
Speak for yourself,
Green Jeans.

38
00:02:32,676 --> 00:02:36,009
- Would somebody please tell me...
- William the Bloody, a vampire.

39
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:38,911
One of the worst recorded.
Second only to...

40
00:02:39,016 --> 00:02:40,608
Me.

41
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:45,955
But you're dead.

42
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:50,391
<i>Well, yeah.</i>
<i>Who here isn't?</i>

43
00:02:50,494 --> 00:02:53,395
Besides him and him
and her and...

44
00:02:54,498 --> 00:02:56,762
What are you again?

45
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,316
Bugger.

46
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:14,766
What... What's
happened to me?

47
00:04:17,281 --> 00:04:21,513
<i>Well, I'm no doctor,</i>
<i>but I think you're a ghost.</i>

48
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:24,144
I'm no...
I'm no bloody ghost.

49
00:04:24,254 --> 00:04:26,688
Hey, you're the one
sticking out of a desk, pal.

50
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,385
<i>And you can't talk to me like that.</i>
<i>We're not going out anymore.</i>

51
00:04:30,494 --> 00:04:32,553
Where'd
he come from?

52
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:35,655
- From this.
<i>- [Fred] What is it?</i>

53
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:39,668
- Somethin' I gave to Buffy before...
- Buffy? Is she...

54
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,829
She's okay.

55
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:43,873
Where?
Where is she?

56
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:47,807
Europe,
last I heard from her.

57
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:50,880
I want to see her,
talk to her.

58
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:53,541
That's gonna be tough.

59
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:57,849
- You can't keep her from me.
- She's not mine to keep or yours.

60
00:04:57,955 --> 00:05:01,186
Says you? You got
no idea what we had.

61
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,021
- You never had her.
- More than you, you poncey...

62
00:05:04,128 --> 00:05:06,926
<i>Oh, my God.!</i>

63
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:09,522
You and
the Slayer actually...

64
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:12,898
<i>I mean, I know you had</i>
<i>that twisted obsession with her, but...</i>

65
00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:17,167
Ugh!
That's just... Ugh!

66
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:19,333
L...

67
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,607
Ugh!

68
00:05:22,913 --> 00:05:24,881
I must be in hell.

69
00:05:24,982 --> 00:05:28,611
<i>Uh, no, L.A. But a lot of people</i>
<i>make that mistake.</i>

70
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:31,347
So Spike and Buffy...

71
00:05:31,455 --> 00:05:35,551
He was, um, an ally
of hers for some time.

72
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:39,595
At least that's what Angel told me.
That's all Angel told me.

73
00:05:39,697 --> 00:05:41,927
So he's a good guy
vampire like Angel?

74
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:43,727
He's nothing like me.

75
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:47,736
Got that right.
What have you done to me?

76
00:05:47,838 --> 00:05:50,398
What is this place?

77
00:05:50,507 --> 00:05:52,737
Who are you people?

78
00:05:52,843 --> 00:05:55,971
What the bloody hell
is happening?

79
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:05,617
- Honey of a story.
- Story?

80
00:06:05,723 --> 00:06:09,659
Yeah. The Vampire Slayer
both men loved, both men lost.

81
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,786
Oh, I could sell that
to any studio in a heartbeat.

82
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:15,296
L... I see
Depp and Bloom.

83
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,799
But then, I see them a lot.

84
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:20,267
Sorry. Hazard of running
the Entertainment Division.

85
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,270
Gotta get out more.

86
00:06:24,374 --> 00:06:27,138
So what are you, then?
Scanner girl?

87
00:06:27,244 --> 00:06:31,237
I'm Fred. I head up
Wolfram and Hart's Science Department.

88
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:34,806
Wolfram and Hart? Heard of that.
Thought it was a law firm.

89
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:37,182
It is, among other things.

90
00:06:37,287 --> 00:06:39,915
Also heard they represent
the worst evil in the universe.

91
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:44,119
It did, among other things.
But now I'm in charge.

92
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:46,526
- Are you, now?
<i>- [Fred] Weird.</i>

93
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:50,361
I'm getting electromagnetic readings
consistent with spiritual entities...

94
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:52,367
but there's no
ectoplasmic matrix.

95
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:56,462
- Meaning?
- Ectoplasm is what makes
ghosts visible to the human eye.

96
00:06:56,573 --> 00:07:00,031
If he's a ghost, technically
we shouldn't be able to see him.

97
00:07:00,144 --> 00:07:02,977
And I'm detecting
brain wave activity.

98
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,173
On Spike? Huh.
That is weird.

99
00:07:05,282 --> 00:07:09,150
Also, ghosts generally
absorb light and heat energy...

100
00:07:09,253 --> 00:07:12,188
making the area around them
a few degrees cooler.

101
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:14,189
Spike's radiating heat.

102
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,384
Think I'm hot,
do you?

103
00:07:16,493 --> 00:07:20,452
Hmm. Lukewarm. Just above
room temperature.

104
00:07:20,564 --> 00:07:22,725
Well, what the hell
am I then?

105
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,801
Whatever he is,
it's clearly tied to this amulet.

106
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:28,463
<i>Spike's essence,</i>
<i>for lack of a better term...</i>

107
00:07:28,572 --> 00:07:30,472
must've been
held within it.

108
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:33,168
<i>Do you have any memory</i>
<i>of a strange sensation...</i>

109
00:07:33,277 --> 00:07:35,177
when it released
its energy?

110
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,839
What, you mean my skin and muscle
burning away from the bone?

111
00:07:37,948 --> 00:07:39,677
<i>Organs exploding</i>
<i>in my chest?</i>

112
00:07:39,783 --> 00:07:42,877
Eyeballs melting in their sockets?
No. No memory at all. Thanks for asking.

113
00:07:42,986 --> 00:07:44,886
<i>[Angel]</i>
<i>Okay, he's connected to the amulet.</i>

114
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:49,357
Last I heard, it was buried deep inside
of the Hellmouth. How did it end up here?

115
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:54,692
Maybe he's here for a reason. You know, some
higher purpose or something he's destined for...

116
00:07:54,798 --> 00:07:57,232
sent to us by the Powers
That Be to help us or...

117
00:07:57,334 --> 00:07:59,996
Who gave them
the bloody right to do that?

118
00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:01,934
[Scoffs]

119
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:07,409
Can't a man die in peace without some
high almighty deciding it's not his time?

120
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:09,376
Let's have a little
more fun with him, eh?

121
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,575
<i>You'd think that saving the soddin'world</i>
<i>would be enough to earn me a rest.</i>

122
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:15,845
- You'd think.
- Spike...

123
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,717
Hmm?
Oh, balls.

124
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:28,964
- Now what?
- I don't know. He just...

125
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:31,193
What did he mean,
saving the world?

126
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,933
Oh, that?
Well...

127
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:37,563
[Scoffs] Buffy did most
of the work.

128
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:39,904
Well, he helped, but...

129
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,912
Hmm?
What? What?

130
00:08:44,014 --> 00:08:46,744
- Took the whats right out of our mouths.
- Where'd you go?

131
00:08:48,418 --> 00:08:52,912
- Don't you know?
- I'm... I was...

132
00:08:54,258 --> 00:08:57,557
You. This is your fault.

133
00:08:57,661 --> 00:09:00,721
- Mine?
- You brought that bloody amulet to Sunnydale.

134
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,629
<i>You would have been the one to use it,</i>
<i>until you chickened out.</i>

135
00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:05,565
- What did you...
- You heard me.

136
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:08,502
<i>You left town in the nick of time,</i>
<i>before the death and mayhem.</i>

137
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:10,766
Abandoned the woman
you claimed to love.

138
00:09:10,874 --> 00:09:12,739
She made the call.
It wasn't my choice.

139
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,812
And this bloody hell
wasn't mine.

140
00:09:15,913 --> 00:09:19,405
<i>I'm not you. I don't give a piss</i>
<i>about atonement or destiny.</i>

141
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:23,145
Just because I've got me a soul doesn't mean
I'm gonna let myself be led around...

142
00:09:23,253 --> 00:09:26,654
- Excuse me?
- Did... Did you just say...

143
00:09:27,758 --> 00:09:30,818
Spike has a soul?
You never said.

144
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:34,329
- Didn't seem worth mentioning.
- Seems to be a lot of that.

145
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:39,698
Or maybe Captain Forehead
was feeling a little less special.

146
00:09:39,803 --> 00:09:42,829
<i>Didn't like me crashing</i>
<i>his exclusive club.</i>

147
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,272
Another vampire
with a soul in the world.

148
00:09:46,443 --> 00:09:50,641
You're not <i>in</i> the world, Casper.

149
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:08,159
Runnin' away again?

150
00:10:08,265 --> 00:10:11,200
Nice new M.O.
I can see why heroes like you...

151
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:13,292
get rewarded with
the shiny new glass and chrome.

152
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:16,497
- Why didn't I think of that?
- I'm not responsible for what happened to you.

153
00:10:16,606 --> 00:10:18,540
Angel, it's almost 3:00.
You have a meeting...

154
00:10:18,642 --> 00:10:21,611
- Not now, Harmony.
- And here, you've even managed
to get my ex-tumble...

155
00:10:21,712 --> 00:10:23,703
the littlest vampire,
fetching coffee for you.

156
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:25,714
- Nice perks for the sellout.
- A little tip, Spike.

157
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:27,784
Try not to talk about
things you don't understand.

158
00:10:27,884 --> 00:10:30,717
I'm not the prat here.
I know you, Angel.

159
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:35,087
What do you think you're doing? You made
some devil's bargain to take over this company.

160
00:10:35,192 --> 00:10:38,753
Thought you'd use it to fight the evil of
the world from inside the belly of the beast.

161
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:41,763
Trouble is, you're too busy fighting to see
you and yours are getting digested.

162
00:10:41,865 --> 00:10:44,163
- Not gonna happen.
- What, you think you're in control here?

163
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:47,430
Guess again, mate.
You're no more in control than I am.

164
00:10:47,537 --> 00:10:50,700
Except I'm not gonna bloody stand for it,
while you're just a blind...

165
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:53,708
- Grox'lar beast.
- What?

166
00:10:57,481 --> 00:11:00,541
[Growls]

167
00:11:05,322 --> 00:11:07,290
Oh, brilliant.

168
00:11:20,237 --> 00:11:22,364
[Bones Cracking]

169
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,811
[Exhales] Okay. Somebody wanna
tell me how a Grox'lar beast...

170
00:11:29,913 --> 00:11:31,813
got past Security?

171
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:34,440
- I don't have time for this.
<i>- [Spike] Of course not.</i>

172
00:11:34,551 --> 00:11:37,816
Man's gotta stay focused on
profit margins and power lunches.

173
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:39,889
- Angel...
- Yeah, Spike, I've got a business to run.

174
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,322
That means responsibilities,
appointments to keep...

175
00:11:42,426 --> 00:11:44,485
- That was your 3:00.
- That...

176
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:52,832
I'm meeting
with Grox'lars?

177
00:11:52,936 --> 00:11:54,836
They eat babies.

178
00:11:54,938 --> 00:11:58,430
Just their heads. You were supposed
to open negotiations with his clan.

179
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:02,842
- Negotiations for what?
- Get 'em to stop eating baby heads.

180
00:12:02,946 --> 00:12:04,937
Oh, so that's good.

181
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,850
Oh, so this...
this is bad.

182
00:12:08,952 --> 00:12:13,150
No, actually the Grox'lar clan respects someone
who takes a strong opening position.

183
00:12:13,256 --> 00:12:15,918
Wolfram and Hart didn't just jack me
up here with the human laws.

184
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,960
Also demon laws
from every dimension.

185
00:12:18,061 --> 00:12:20,325
<i>Probably should've briefed</i>
<i>you about the Grox'lar...</i>

186
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,126
but we got a little
sidetracked.

187
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:27,829
Plus, I've been implementing our
reforms, mostly staff overhaul.

188
00:12:27,938 --> 00:12:30,202
I fired 40 employees
in the past two days.

189
00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:32,002
- How's that goin'?
- As expected.

190
00:12:32,109 --> 00:12:34,805
Anger, tears,
venomous death threats.

191
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:38,312
<i>Listen, I know I was</i>
<i>a little crabby before.</i>

192
00:12:38,415 --> 00:12:41,714
I mean, hello.
A little awkward seeing you at my work.

193
00:12:41,818 --> 00:12:46,653
But if... if you want to talk or something,
you know, about us or...

194
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:51,720
Okay, too soon.

195
00:12:51,828 --> 00:12:53,921
I understand.

196
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,157
Slayer-loving freak.

197
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:58,665
Caught an associate
we laid off...

198
00:12:58,768 --> 00:13:01,532
tryin' to smuggle this
out of the Voodoo Division.

199
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:04,864
It's a nice likeness.

200
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,510
<i>This placejust</i>
<i>goes on and on, doesn't it?</i>

201
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:10,477
Like a ruddy
theme park attraction.

202
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,414
- I'm in a meeting, Spike.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't care.

203
00:13:14,518 --> 00:13:16,748
<i>We're rufflin'a lot of</i>
<i>dangerous feathers out there.</i>

204
00:13:16,853 --> 00:13:18,753
There's gonna be a backlash.
Count on it.

205
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:21,153
We'll just have to ride out
the ripples for a while.

206
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,852
I'm sensin' a ripple
on its way now.

207
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,427
Yes, uh...

208
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:27,497
Novac, sir. Uh,
what's this about you...

209
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:30,031
shutting down
the Internment Acquisitions Division?

210
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:32,999
- Internment Acqui...
- Grave-robbing.

211
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:36,834
<i>Listen, I know you fellows are in charge now,</i>
<i>and you're doin'a bang-upjob.</i>

212
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,669
<i>I'm with you 110%.</i>

213
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:41,369
But that department brings in
<i>mucho</i> revenue to this company.

214
00:13:41,478 --> 00:13:44,572
Well, Novac, we'll just have to
tighten our belts and do without.

215
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:47,411
No, you're not getting it.

216
00:13:47,517 --> 00:13:49,917
Sir.

217
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,787
I.A.D. Is under contract to provide
fresh bodies to Magnus Hainsley.

218
00:13:54,891 --> 00:13:56,791
You know
who he is, right?

219
00:13:59,996 --> 00:14:03,124
Oy. Okay. He's one
of our oldest clients.

220
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:05,531
Big potatoes.
We stop delivering...

221
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:09,071
and he is not going
to be... thrilled.

222
00:14:09,172 --> 00:14:13,131
Then he's probably not gonna like it when
you advise him that he's no longer our client.

223
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:16,269
- Me?
- You got it, counselor.

224
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:18,847
- You tell Mr<i>...</i> [Clear Throat]
- Hainsley.

225
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:21,679
Hainsley that
Wolfram and Hart...

226
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:25,118
is under new management and out of
the grave-robbing business.

227
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:28,419
Now, run along
and go argue your case.

228
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:31,926
- Me?
- Go.

229
00:14:34,998 --> 00:14:37,466
You don't have to
take that from him, mate.

230
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,592
Stay out of this, Spike.
You don't work here.

231
00:14:39,703 --> 00:14:42,570
Damn right I don't.
Look at you.

232
00:14:42,672 --> 00:14:46,574
<i>This is what you do now? Delegate</i>
<i>the dirty work to spineless, low-level flunkies?</i>

233
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:48,576
No offense.

234
00:14:48,678 --> 00:14:53,206
<i>The mighty hero, reduced to</i>
<i>a bloody bureaucrat.</i>

235
00:14:53,316 --> 00:14:55,284
If a certain Slayer
could see you now...

236
00:14:55,385 --> 00:14:57,785
Get outta here, Spike.

237
00:14:57,887 --> 00:15:01,823
Gladly. Cruel enough punishment
being stuck here as a spook...

238
00:15:01,925 --> 00:15:04,723
while you play
chairman of the boring.

239
00:15:04,828 --> 00:15:08,059
But hell if I'm going to spend
my afterlife in your stinking city.

240
00:15:08,164 --> 00:15:10,257
Get stuffed.

241
00:15:28,752 --> 00:15:32,279
<i>You don't think</i>
<i>he's really gone, do you?</i>

242
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,483
That what's
on your mind?

243
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:37,526
Could've been me, Wes.

244
00:15:37,627 --> 00:15:39,618
It was supposed to be me.

245
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:42,391
- You're not feeling guilty.
- What, about Spike?

246
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:44,626
[Chuckles]
That's... That's not...

247
00:15:47,637 --> 00:15:51,368
Wolfram and Hart
gave me the amulet.

248
00:15:51,474 --> 00:15:53,874
They must have
expected me to use it...

249
00:15:53,977 --> 00:15:57,310
and they had to have known it would have
done to me what it did to Spike, so...

250
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,905
<i>Why bother handing you</i>
<i>the keys to the kingdom?</i>

251
00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:03,543
<i>It doesn't make sense. What are</i>
<i>the senior partners playing at?</i>

252
00:16:03,653 --> 00:16:05,883
Maybe there's dissent
in their ranks. Or maybe...

253
00:16:05,989 --> 00:16:09,356
there's another player in the game
they and we don't know anything about.

254
00:16:11,094 --> 00:16:13,654
Then again, maybe they got exactly
what they were after.

255
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,699
- Spike.
- He may be the one they...

256
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:20,395
What are you doin' here?
I thought you left town.

257
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:22,562
Don't think
I didn't bleeding try.

258
00:16:22,672 --> 00:16:26,403
Every time I got as far as the city limits,
I kept popping back here.

259
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:29,103
Like my insides
were getting yanked.

260
00:16:29,212 --> 00:16:32,409
<i>I suspected as much. The amulet's</i>
<i>Wolfram and Hart's property.</i>

261
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:35,177
It's bound to this place.
And since Spike's connected to it...

262
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,186
Hey, I'm nobody's
bloody property, Percy.

263
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:43,248
<i>So what, I'm just stuck here forever?</i>
<i>I bet you're loving this, aren't you?</i>

264
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,692
Knowing you'll be haunting me
till the end of time.

265
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:47,888
Mm, it's a dream come true.

266
00:16:47,997 --> 00:16:52,457
<i>[Harmony] Uh, boss? That Novac lawyer</i>
<i>you sent over to dump the client...</i>

267
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:54,469
Well, he's back.

268
00:16:54,571 --> 00:16:57,870
- Okay, send him in.
- Okay.

269
00:17:06,683 --> 00:17:08,708
<i>[Angel]</i>
<i>What is...</i>

270
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:17,890
Hmm. OI' buckets here was right.

271
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:19,894
You guys are doin'
a bang-up job.

272
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,602
Harmony, get me
Novac's contact list.

273
00:17:30,707 --> 00:17:32,902
Close relations,
next of kin.

274
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:35,807
And let's be discreet about this
for the time being, okay?

275
00:17:35,912 --> 00:17:41,111
Discreet? Oh, you mean like not tell anyone
about bucket o' lawyer.

276
00:17:41,217 --> 00:17:42,980
- Harmony, contact list.
- Hey.

277
00:17:43,086 --> 00:17:44,986
Got word you wanted the file
on Magnus Hainsley.

278
00:17:45,088 --> 00:17:46,988
Dig this.
He's a sorcerer, big-time.

279
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,990
Rich with old money
and older mojo.

280
00:17:49,092 --> 00:17:51,287
Owns a respectable block of shares
in Wolfram and Hart...

281
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:53,294
and he's connected
up the wazoo.

282
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:56,661
Carries influence with power players
in the entertainment industry, politics...

283
00:17:56,766 --> 00:17:58,859
- Oh, he's a necromancer.
- Power over the dead.

284
00:17:58,968 --> 00:18:01,869
That explains the bodies
Wolfram and Hart's been providing him.

285
00:18:01,971 --> 00:18:05,099
But not what he's been doing with them.
Out of my chair.

286
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:09,607
- Make me.
- What's in the buckets?

287
00:18:09,712 --> 00:18:13,512
Your man Novac. Guess he's been...
what do you call it... downsized.

288
00:18:13,616 --> 00:18:16,551
It's a message
from Magnus Hainsley.

289
00:18:16,653 --> 00:18:18,848
And I'm gonna
reply to it personally.

290
00:18:18,955 --> 00:18:22,857
- You can't take Hainsley on.
- I'm not gonna risk him
turning somebody else into chowder.

291
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:25,655
<i>Angel, you've got a multibillion-dollar</i>
<i>company at your disposal...</i>

292
00:18:25,762 --> 00:18:27,696
<i>with armed</i>
<i>and trained personnel.</i>

293
00:18:27,797 --> 00:18:31,995
- They cramp my style.
<i>- Your style's not going to cut it</i>
<i>with a necromancer.</i>

294
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:35,969
We should probably avoid
an eye-for-an-eye escalation here.

295
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:39,872
- I'm not goin' for his eyes, Wes.
- I know what you should go for.

296
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:44,137
It'll hurt him. Bad.

297
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:01,524
<i>[Spike]</i>
<i>Knew you'd pick the Viper.</i>

298
00:19:01,631 --> 00:19:05,192
- So bloody predictable.
- Spike, get out of the car.

299
00:19:05,301 --> 00:19:07,895
- No.
- What?

300
00:19:08,004 --> 00:19:11,531
This "haunting you until the end of time" idea
of yours is starting to sound appealing.

301
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:13,939
<i>I could drive you</i>
<i>completely starkers.</i>

302
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:18,377
Right out of your gourd. Yeah, and you wouldn't
be able to do a soddin' thing about it.

303
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,794
Fancy a road trip?

304
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:37,128
This'll be fun, eh?
You and me together again.

305
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:39,724
So, where are we off to?

306
00:19:39,836 --> 00:19:42,361
To see the wizard.

307
00:19:50,246 --> 00:19:52,714
Do you have an appointment
with Mr. Hainsley?

308
00:19:52,815 --> 00:19:56,114
Let's just say
he sent us an invitation.

309
00:19:56,219 --> 00:19:59,279
We're... I'm from
Wolfram and Hart.

310
00:20:00,557 --> 00:20:02,525
I'm his date.

311
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,253
<i>Mr. Hainsley is with</i>
<i>a customer at the moment.</i>

312
00:20:05,361 --> 00:20:08,626
I'm afraid he does not suffer
interruption lightly.

313
00:20:08,731 --> 00:20:12,167
I'm not so worried about his suffering.
Go ahead and interrupt.

314
00:20:12,268 --> 00:20:15,601
As you wish.
Please wait here, gentlemen.

315
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:21,332
Oh, life among
the power elite.

316
00:20:21,444 --> 00:20:23,344
It's all so civilized.

317
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:26,973
Hainsley grinds up one of your people
into chum, and you drop by for tea.

318
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,381
I'm hopin' to avoid
a body count here.

319
00:20:29,485 --> 00:20:33,854
No worries. Looks like
this Hainsley keeps one on hand.

320
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,734
Man likes to play
with dollies.

321
00:20:46,836 --> 00:20:48,861
This isn't for him.

00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:53,363
Close enough anyway.

425

<i>You can't fight against it.</i>
<i>You can't fix it.</i>

<i>Hell, you can't even lift a finger</i>
<i>'cause you simply don't have any.</i>

00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,650
Yeah.
What's it to you?

431
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:13,051
I can give you back
what's been taken from you.

432
00:27:13,155 --> 00:27:16,318
Freedom.
Power of choice.

433
00:27:16,425 --> 00:27:21,192
I can put your destiny back in
your own flesh-and-bone hands.

434
00:27:21,297 --> 00:27:25,393
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>A corporeal body.</i>

435
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:28,595
I can make that happen.

436
00:27:28,704 --> 00:27:31,901
But to do that, I need you
to do something for me.

437
00:27:32,008 --> 00:27:33,908
Something that
might require...

438
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,205
Hurt Angel? That it?
You want me to hurt Angel?

439
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:44,519
You've come
to the right ghost.

440
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,223
<i>Wiped out every asset</i>

00:27:52,328 --> 00:27:55,229
Wasn't easy. Man's got his fingers

442
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:58,129
I think pies are gonna be off

443
00:27:58,234 --> 00:28:00,964
It's gotta hurt. I mean,
damn, who doesn't love pie?

444
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,368
<i>- [Fred] You're back.</i>
- Hainsley out of business?

445
00:28:03,472 --> 00:28:06,236
- Yeah, for the time being.
- So he's not going away?

446
00:28:06,342 --> 00:28:09,334
I think that "This isn't over yet, vampire"
may be the tip-off.

447
00:28:09,445 --> 00:28:12,972
Guys, can we get back
to my, uh, spiritual crisis?

448
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:15,107
Yes. Spike.

449
00:28:15,217 --> 00:28:16,980
Popped out at me
at Hainsley's place.

450
00:28:17,086 --> 00:28:19,850
But we all know that
he'll be back, and back...

451
00:28:19,955 --> 00:28:22,321
and back, and I really don't want
that happening again.

452
00:28:22,425 --> 00:28:26,054
So explain to me how we're going
to get him out of here.

453
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,255
He can't
get out of here.

454
00:28:28,364 --> 00:28:30,594
Please don't tell me that.

455
00:28:30,699 --> 00:28:32,599
Okay.

456
00:28:32,701 --> 00:28:35,829
Wesley, you tell him.

457
00:28:35,938 --> 00:28:39,396
I've had my entire department doing
thorough research on the amulet.

458
00:28:39,508 --> 00:28:44,639
There's not much. Not in the way
of releasing Spike from it anyway.

459
00:28:44,747 --> 00:28:47,739
At least not in
the conventional sense.

460
00:28:48,851 --> 00:28:50,910
And what's
the unconventional sense?

461
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,614
Something he asked for.

462
00:28:53,722 --> 00:28:56,156
Eternal rest.

463
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:07,427
<i>- Fine. Don't talk to me.</i>
- What?

464
00:29:07,536 --> 00:29:10,699
Whole time we were a thing
you treated me like day-old rat blood.

465
00:29:10,806 --> 00:29:14,799
Why should now be any diff?
Just 'cause you've gone all Patrick Swayze.

466
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:17,970
- What are you on about?
- Well, gee, nothing much.

467
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,776
Just since you're
all soulful now...

468
00:29:20,883 --> 00:29:25,115
I thought maybe, just maybe,
you might have learned to open up a little.

469
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,815
<i>You know, talk.</i>

470
00:29:27,923 --> 00:29:30,721
But I guess a leopard
can't change his stripes.

471
00:29:30,826 --> 00:29:33,818
Spots, you dink.
Leopards have spots.

472
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:35,863
Oh, excuse me,
Mr. Brainy.

473
00:29:35,965 --> 00:29:40,061
Thank you so much for sharing.
Wow, what a breakthrough.

00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,974
<i>[Wesley] Yes, this is</i>
<i>an unusual situation...</i>

475
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,476
<i>but I think it's</i>

476
00:29:49,578 --> 00:29:52,513
<i>It's what we'd do in any case</i>
<i>of a haunting, isn't it?</i>

477
00:29:52,615 --> 00:29:54,810
<i>An exorcism of sorts.</i>

478
00:29:56,652 --> 00:30:00,918
I mean, I know he's already dead,
but he'd be gone dead.

479
00:30:01,023 --> 00:30:03,924
<i>Forever. Itjust</i>
<i>doesn't seem right.</i>

480
00:30:04,026 --> 00:30:06,187
<i>I agree. But neither</i>
<i>is leaving him here.</i>

481
00:30:06,295 --> 00:30:09,423
Trapped between realms,
with no control over his fate...

482
00:30:09,532 --> 00:30:12,160
<i>not able to touch anything,</i>
<i>affect anything.</i>

483
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,168
<i>Unable to fight.</i>

484
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,568
Letting him cross over seems
the most merciful thing we...

485
00:30:16,672 --> 00:30:21,507
Yeah, yeah, mercy. You know,
I'm all for it. Just tell me how we do it.

486
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,511
The amulet's protected,
invulnerable to anything.

487
00:30:24,613 --> 00:30:27,582
But the magic that's protecting it
doesn't work on hallowed ground.

488
00:30:27,683 --> 00:30:31,175
- Hallowed? Like a church?
- Or cemetery, yes.

489
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:34,688
<i>- It has to be taken there and destroyed.</i>
- Destroyed how?

490
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,759
I think a sharp blow
would probably do the trick.

491
00:30:39,395 --> 00:30:41,363
Angel, what do you think?

492
00:30:46,202 --> 00:30:48,568
Think I want
to sleep on it.

493
00:31:50,065 --> 00:31:52,659
<i>[Spike]</i>
<i>Well, look at you.</i>

494
00:31:52,768 --> 00:31:54,759
Oh, no. No.

495
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,701
No, no!

496
00:31:56,805 --> 00:31:59,933
Sitting in
luxury's ample lap.

497
00:32:01,644 --> 00:32:04,169
Top of the world...

498
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,271
<i>Iooking down on...</i>

499
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,612
well, everyone.

500
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:12,119
It's good to be king,
isn't it?

501
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:15,748
Ground rules: Haunt me all you want
during business hours...

502
00:32:15,858 --> 00:32:18,292
but this space...
off-limits.

503
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,692
Relax, beefcake.
I didn't come for a fight.

504
00:32:23,732 --> 00:32:26,895
- Really?
- Not that I could, right?

505
00:32:27,002 --> 00:32:29,129
Can't touch.
Can't affect anything.

506
00:32:31,106 --> 00:32:34,872
Yeah, I overheard your little group
powwow about me.

507
00:32:34,977 --> 00:32:37,844
- How much?
- Enough of enough.

508
00:32:37,946 --> 00:32:39,573
Look, Spike-

509
00:32:39,682 --> 00:32:43,641
- Necromancer tried to make a deal with me.
- What?

510
00:32:43,752 --> 00:32:47,518
Said he could bring me back,
body and soul...

511
00:32:47,623 --> 00:32:52,526
if I used our close personal relationship
to double-cross you.

512
00:32:52,628 --> 00:32:56,155
Tempting.
And what'd you say?

513
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,392
You see, right there...
that's a problem.

514
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:04,234
You having to ask me that. I don't play
for that side anymore or haven't you heard.

515
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,104
Besides, even if Mr. Death
could do what he promised...

516
00:33:07,209 --> 00:33:10,076
I trust him about
as much as you trust me.

517
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:12,443
What do you want from me?

518
00:33:15,851 --> 00:33:17,785
I can't live
like this, Angel.

519
00:33:19,988 --> 00:33:22,286
Bein' useless.

520
00:33:23,392 --> 00:33:25,952
Bein' nothing.

521
00:33:27,963 --> 00:33:30,090
I want it to end.

522
00:33:53,989 --> 00:33:55,752
[Spike]
I suppose this'll do.

523
00:33:55,858 --> 00:33:57,951
Feels hallowed enough.

524
00:34:02,564 --> 00:34:04,555
Sure you want
to do this, Spike?

525
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:06,827
What? Think I could
really stand hanging out...

526
00:34:06,935 --> 00:34:09,426
with you and your lot
now and forever?

527
00:34:09,538 --> 00:34:12,769
Wisecracking ghost sidekick.
No bloody thanks.

528
00:34:14,476 --> 00:34:17,639
<i>Come on. You know</i>
<i>as well as I do, it's for the best.</i>

529
00:34:21,116 --> 00:34:24,608
I'm glad it's you, though,
finally doin' me in.

530
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,587
Feels right, you bein'
my grandsire and all.

531
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:32,287
Circle of death, eh?

532
00:34:33,796 --> 00:34:35,696
Good-bye, Spike.

533
00:34:35,798 --> 00:34:38,232
See you around, Angel.

534
00:34:39,935 --> 00:34:42,028
<i>Uh, I think you missed.</i>

535
00:34:44,606 --> 00:34:46,437
[Groaning]

536
00:34:48,744 --> 00:34:51,542
<i>And the dead shall rise.!</i>

537
00:34:51,647 --> 00:34:54,013
Just 'cause I say so.

538
00:34:54,116 --> 00:34:57,517
- Hainsley.
- Vampires should think twice...

539
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:02,181
before messing with a man
who wields power over all things lifeless.

540
00:35:05,427 --> 00:35:09,193
If you ask my advice.

541
00:35:09,298 --> 00:35:11,823
Took your sweet time
steppin' in, Hainsley.

542
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:14,402
I came this close to getting
a one-way to the great beyond.

543
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:18,234
Relax, son. I wasn't going
to let anything happen to you.

544
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:22,333
<i>- You're the linchpin of my plan.</i>
- Our plan.

545
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:27,842
And you bloody better hold up
your end of it. I'm not gonna be used by you.

546
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,145
Yes, you are.

547
00:35:30,252 --> 00:35:33,483
But afterwards, I'll give you
your reward, just as you asked.

548
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:37,889
I'll put you back
in the driver's seat of your afterlife.

549
00:35:39,561 --> 00:35:41,825
Control.

550
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:46,264
<i>That's all anyone</i>
<i>really wants, isn't it?</i>

551
00:35:57,579 --> 00:36:01,345
<i>Hello, vampire.</i>
<i>Have a nice nap?</i>

552
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:05,079
- No...
<i>- Don't get up. You've had a rough day.</i>

553
00:36:05,187 --> 00:36:09,123
You know, so have I,
thanks to you.

554
00:36:09,224 --> 00:36:11,522
Yours is about to get
a hell of a lot worse.

555
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:17,224
I don't think so.
Me, necromancer. You, dead.

556
00:36:18,534 --> 00:36:21,196
- You can't lay a finger on me.
- Maybe not.

557
00:36:21,303 --> 00:36:26,138
But what do you think the senior partners
are gonna do to you when I turn up missing?

558
00:36:26,241 --> 00:36:28,072
Oh, you're not going
to be missing.

559
00:36:28,176 --> 00:36:32,044
You're going to show up to work bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed tomorrow morning...

560
00:36:32,147 --> 00:36:35,548
when you reverse the seizure
of my personal assets...

561
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:39,246
and reinstate the Internment
Acquisitions Department.

562
00:36:39,354 --> 00:36:42,152
- And why would I do that?
<i>- [Spike] Not you.</i>

563
00:36:42,257 --> 00:36:44,919
Me.

564
00:36:46,094 --> 00:36:48,722
Wearin' your body.

565
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:51,492
And to think
I didn't trust you.

566
00:36:52,634 --> 00:36:56,070
Come on, Angel.
What choice did I have?

567
00:36:56,171 --> 00:36:59,663
Bloody exorcism?
Letting you and yours banish me to oblivion?

568
00:36:59,775 --> 00:37:02,266
No, thanks.

569
00:37:02,377 --> 00:37:07,076
Necro here is gonna give me my body back
after I take yours for a test drive.

570
00:37:07,182 --> 00:37:09,116
Fix his
little problems.

571
00:37:09,217 --> 00:37:11,344
And here's the kicker.

572
00:37:11,453 --> 00:37:13,648
I go in, and you...

573
00:37:13,755 --> 00:37:15,985
go pfft!

574
00:37:16,091 --> 00:37:18,252
Off to Never-Never-
Come-Back-Land.

575
00:37:19,628 --> 00:37:22,825
And then, yours very truly
will be running the show.

576
00:37:22,931 --> 00:37:26,298
Your cars,
your fancy digs, everything.

577
00:37:26,401 --> 00:37:30,337
Every <i>one</i> I deserve
will be mine.

578
00:37:31,807 --> 00:37:35,368
And maybe I'll have
a go with that Fred.

579
00:37:35,477 --> 00:37:39,004
She looks like a goer. And she seems
to really look up to you.

580
00:37:39,114 --> 00:37:41,173
Shut up!

581
00:37:41,283 --> 00:37:44,252
You know what?
You're right.

582
00:37:44,353 --> 00:37:47,516
Enough talk.
Let's do this already.

583
00:37:47,623 --> 00:37:51,024
I'm itching
to get physical.

584
00:37:51,126 --> 00:37:55,688
I've never installed anyone
in a conscious dead body before.

585
00:37:55,797 --> 00:37:59,460
I imagine this is going to be
extremely painful.

586
00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:03,863
[Droning]

587
00:38:40,175 --> 00:38:42,700
[Stammering]

588
00:38:44,212 --> 00:38:47,739
What...
What are you doing?

589
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:50,750
Spike... Spike...

590
00:38:50,852 --> 00:38:54,015
No. No!

591
00:38:57,492 --> 00:38:59,756
I can touch you now,
Hainsley.

592
00:39:03,999 --> 00:39:07,366
Think you're clever, eh?
But... [Groans]

593
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:09,699
<i>Your ghost can't</i>
<i>control me for long.</i>

594
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,740
I hold the power.
I rule the dead.

595
00:39:15,977 --> 00:39:17,877
Not today.

596
00:39:38,567 --> 00:39:40,797
Oh, bollocks.

597
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:45,939
I was just
gettin' warmed up.

598
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:49,033
- That was you hitting me?
- That last bit, yeah.

599
00:39:49,144 --> 00:39:51,408
Hainsley's been dead
since he hit the table.

600
00:39:53,048 --> 00:39:56,415
Oh, come on. Had to get
a few licks in, didn't I?

601
00:40:07,963 --> 00:40:10,693
<i>I see. So Spike came</i>
<i>to you with this plan.</i>

602
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:14,257
More or less. Once he learned Hainsley
used himself as a conduit for body transfers...

603
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:17,167
- our trap fell into place.
- A bit reckless.

604
00:40:17,272 --> 00:40:20,264
<i>[Wesley] If Spike's going to be</i>
<i>sticking around, it'd be prudent ofhim...</i>

605
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:23,208
to share his plans with the rest of us
in the future.

606
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:25,871
Yeah, well, uh, sharing's not
something Spike does very well.

607
00:40:25,981 --> 00:40:27,812
Preaching to
the horse's mouth.

608
00:40:47,102 --> 00:40:50,629
Spike.
What are y-you...

609
00:40:53,141 --> 00:40:55,041
Can I help you?

610
00:40:56,678 --> 00:41:00,239
Well, that's the heart of it, isn't it?
The crux. The nub.

611
00:41:00,348 --> 00:41:02,213
I'm sorry?

612
00:41:04,986 --> 00:41:06,886
You're the smart one,
aren't you?

613
00:41:06,988 --> 00:41:12,187
The go-to girl who knows
all about this ghost mumbo jumbo.

614
00:41:12,294 --> 00:41:17,197
Um, well, a-actually Wesley's
the occult expert.

615
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:20,826
H-He was trained as a Watcher.
He knows about the supernatural.

616
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:23,336
Yeah, but you're
the science queen.

617
00:41:23,438 --> 00:41:26,669
The hows, the what-ifs,
that's your cup of tea.

618
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:29,869
You figure things out in that
cute little noggin of yours.

619
00:41:29,978 --> 00:41:31,946
I guess.

620
00:41:34,549 --> 00:41:36,540
What...

621
00:41:36,651 --> 00:41:39,711
l-Is there something...

622
00:41:42,858 --> 00:41:45,224
I'm slippin'.

623
00:41:46,461 --> 00:41:48,361
What?

624
00:41:48,463 --> 00:41:50,431
I don't want to go.

625
00:41:50,532 --> 00:41:52,432
But it's like...

626
00:41:52,534 --> 00:41:57,528
It's like the ground underneath me
is splitting open...

627
00:41:57,639 --> 00:42:02,770
and my legs are straddling both sides
of this bloody big chasm.

628
00:42:02,878 --> 00:42:06,109
It's getting wider
and pulling me in.

629
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:10,376
Is that...

630
00:42:10,485 --> 00:42:13,579
Is that what's happening
when you keep vanishing?

631
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,086
I know what's down there.

632
00:42:21,596 --> 00:42:25,362
Where it's tryin'
to take me.

633
00:42:25,467 --> 00:42:28,027
And it's not
the place heroes go.

634
00:42:28,136 --> 00:42:30,468
Not by
a bloody long shot.

635
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,302
It's the other one.

636
00:42:34,409 --> 00:42:37,606
Full of fire and torment.

637
00:42:40,715 --> 00:42:42,615
And it's happening.

638
00:42:44,219 --> 00:42:46,244
And I'm terrified.

639
00:42:54,296 --> 00:42:56,594
Help me?

640
00:43:34,669 --> 00:43:37,069
Grr! Arrgh!
