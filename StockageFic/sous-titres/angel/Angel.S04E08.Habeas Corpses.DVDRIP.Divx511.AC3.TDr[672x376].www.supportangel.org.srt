- Winifred Burkle.
FRED: Thank you, professor.

00:00:07,813 --> 00:00:10,964
- Why are you dressed like that?
- Isn't this what you like?

- We haven't touched each other since...

00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:20,410
- Since we murdered Professor Seidel.
- No, since I did.

Think about getting back out there and
mixing it up with that demon-y thing.

That's not what Angel would do.

Thanks for your opinion,

What demon-y thing?

Afraid so, peanut. And if there
was ever truth in advertising...

65
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:11,132
Charles, if he's really that big and bad,
maybe we should wait for Angel.

66
00:05:11,293 --> 00:05:12,726
If he couldn't stop him...

67
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:15,282
So we wait because we don't
know what Angel would do?

68
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:16,966
Would I do what?

00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:19,693

- They're fine.

Not exactly.

So that's a good thing.

82
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:51,525
Don't do that.

83
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:54,412
- Do what?
- That.

- Understand what I'm saying?
- Yeah, that it was special.

92
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:29,968

You said that it didn't matter anymore.

I don't know the answers,
don't know most of the questions...

00:26:49,853 --> 00:26:53,448
...but what I do know is I have to go
into Wolfram and Hart and find my son.

Now, as far as us versus
the Big Bad is concerned...

00:26:56,893 --> 00:27:00,772
...there's only one smart way to play it.
We see it, we run like hell.

Excuse me.

- Cordelia...

...I don't want you there.
It's too dangerous.

352
00:27:17,253 --> 00:27:18,572
Way too dangerous.

353
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:21,642
I can't risk it.

We'll stay here and keep
the home fires burning.

about 30 meters up.

Well, I'm doing.

Shut up. I don't give a rat's ass
about what's going on between you.

We'll have to take the stairs.

Why go all <i>Terminator</i>

Maybe all it wants is to eliminate
the competition.

- He's not in here.
- Let's be certain.

00:31:22,773 --> 00:31:24,286
No, she's right.

387
00:31:24,453 --> 00:31:27,809
He's not.
That's good. Means he's still alive.

We should split up.

392
00:31:38,893 --> 00:31:43,364
You three take one stairwell.
Sweep each floor. We'll meet up top.

- We can't kill it. And, no, it's not.

- He looks dead.
- He is dead.

00:32:53,053 --> 00:32:55,851
Technically, he's undead.
He's a zombie.

00:32:56,013 --> 00:32:58,766
What's a zombie?

402
00:33:00,893 --> 00:33:02,087
