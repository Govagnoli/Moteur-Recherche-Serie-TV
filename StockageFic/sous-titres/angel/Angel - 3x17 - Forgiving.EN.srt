1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:04,000
- Previously:
- Check me out. Mr. Dad!

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,929
You don't know him.
Everything he's done for me, for us.

3
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:11,580
- Sounds like a nice cult.
- The vampire will devour his child,

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,359
- Wesley's taken the baby away.
- Everything you said is true.

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,370
- You have to get to a hospital.
- No, I just need to do this.

6
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:22,320
- It went well?
- Yes.

7
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:24,300
Hello, I'm your father.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,519
- Come any closer, I'll snap his neck!
- You will give us the kid.

9
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:31,699
- We want the child dead.
- Take him.

10
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:37,280
You're looking into the darkest
of the dark worlds.

11
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:39,509
- Take him!
- No!

12
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,230
You've reached Wesley
Wyndam-Pryce, leave a message.

13
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,790
Wesley?

14
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:32,799
Wesley, it's Fred,

15
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:36,250
Please, if you're there,
pick up, Please,

16
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,120
Wesley?

17
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:41,019
Wesley, it's Fred,

18
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,069
If you're there, pick up,

19
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:45,219
- Please.
- Fred?

20
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,959
It doesn't make sense.

21
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:52,560
- He wouldn't take Angel's child.
- He did.

22
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,530
It's Wesley. Why would he do that?

23
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,000
- We find him, we'll ask.
- If Angel finds him--

24
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:01,170
He'll kill him, and we won't
be able to ask.

25
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,919
I should stay here in case he comes
back. You go find Angel before--

26
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,539
Wesley's not coming back.

27
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:16,729
No toothbrush, no razor, no Mossberg
12-gauge he kept in the closet.

28
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,389
He wouldn't betray us.

29
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,090
And he wouldn't leave without
saying something to me...

30
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,060
...not unless he had
a hell of an urgent reason!

31
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:29,590
I don't think you're gonna
find it there.

32
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:31,849
Where are his diaries?

33
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,550
- He kept diaries.
- They're not here or at the office.

34
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:39,639
Which is where we should be going
to get a heads up on Angel.

35
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,229
- We gotta find his diaries.
- We gotta find him.

36
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,580
If he was answering his cell,
he would've the first 40 times.

37
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:49,849
You telling me to quit trying?

38
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,610
Sorry.

39
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,069
Don't be. Keep trying.

40
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,810
Come on, Wes,
give us something.

41
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,389
What are they doing here?

42
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,889
So we can continue training.

43
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,379
No more training,
and no more practice.

44
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,479
From here out, everything is real.

45
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,210
Where's Captain Holtz?

46
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,040
He escaped.

47
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,680
With the vampire's child.

48
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:28,459
As he and I planned.

49
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:32,160
Captain asked me
to pass on his praise.

50
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:35,829
He wanted me to say
that you fought valiantly...

51
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,889
...and with honor.

52
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,310
- Where are they? The captain and--?
- Gone. For good.

53
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:49,339
- What are we supposed to do?
- He told us to finish what he started.

54
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:52,949
We're going to kill Angelus.

55
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,839
I don't believe it.

56
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,589
It's true.

57
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,149
No, it can't be.
The baby's not gone.

58
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,769
I'm sorry, sweetie, but he is.

59
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:05,129
Not like that.

60
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,199
Not a portal.

61
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,990
There's pulling, and there's noise...

62
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,370
...and there's nothing to hold on to,
nothing at all.

63
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:19,649
Baby....

64
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:21,329
He must have been so scared.

65
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,209
I know.

66
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:37,560
This is making less and less sense.

67
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,220
You're saying that Wesley walked
up to Holtz and handed over Connor?

68
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:46,209
They'd been meeting secretly.
I read that before Wesley attacked me.

69
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,689
Then you read him wrong.

70
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,670
He wasn't taking him
for a stroll, Charles.

71
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,889
When he left with that child,
he didn't plan on coming back, ever.

72
00:06:58,649 --> 00:06:59,910
God.

73
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:01,709
Why?

74
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,569
All I care about is getting
my son back.

75
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,199
Then I'll deal with those responsible.
They'll all pay...

76
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,149
...including Wesley.

77
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,389
- Quor-toth dimension. Hear of it?
- No.

78
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:16,879
That's where the portal led.
That's where my son is now.

79
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,129
- Find out everything you can.
- Yes.

80
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,319
- We're going there, aren't we?
- I am.

81
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,459
- You're not going alone.
- We're with you all the way.

82
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:27,790
- Good.
- It's just....

83
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,930
- What?
- Don't we need to open a portal?

84
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,069
- Yeah.
- The last time we had to do that--

85
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:40,199
It wasn't any of us that knew how.
The guy that figured it out--

86
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,060
- How can we do this without--?
- We don't need him.

87
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,720
- We don't?
- No.

88
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,810
We're gonna find the son of a bitch
who opened the portal.

89
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,500
His name's Sahjhan,
some kind of interdimensional demon.

90
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,600
He's been behind this
since the beginning.

91
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:01,639
So, Sahjhan.

92
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,519
- Linwood.
- Not much of a handshake...

93
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,779
...what with being incorporeal and
all. You didn't mention you'd met.

94
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:13,180
And with Angel too, apparently.

95
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:15,439
All behind my back.

96
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:17,850
No, it wasn't.

97
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:22,129
It's all in my report, which I was
making sure would be on your desk.

98
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,370
Very considerate of you.

99
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,759
That Angel. He sure keeps us
hopping, doesn't he?

100
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,200
We're in a war
you can never win, Lilah...

101
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,149
...full of sticky moral quandaries.

102
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,820
The side you choose
should always be mine.

103
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,940
If it's any consolation,
I did have a gun to my head.

104
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:51,330
Yes, I know.
I'm sorry that happened.

105
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:55,769
So Sahjhan opened a door
to the Quor-toth...

106
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,970
...and in went Holtz and baby?

107
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:02,440
- That's the long and short of it.
- I know you made every effort...

108
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,669
...to preserve that baby for us.

109
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,129
Gun at my head.

110
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,960
Still, a big win for Holtz.

111
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:16,809
If you call jumping into a cesspool
hell dimension a win.

112
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,399
Well, certainly not for us.

113
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:27,570
I can't find Sahjhan.
You sure you heard that?

114
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:32,220
- Maybe you're not spelling it right.
- I've tried every permutation.

115
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:35,970
It could be a nickname,
which would be in...

116
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,210
...Phisto 's Dictionary of
Demons and Dimensional Spirits,

117
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,440
Okay.

118
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,980
But it's in Ga-Shundi,
and I don't read Ga-Shundi.

119
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:48,600
- You check the files?
- Cordy's filing system isn't in English.

120
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:51,960
She kept a list of time,
space and shifting entities.

121
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,440
- Under time, space or entities?
- Let's just check them all.

122
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:00,179
It's Monday.
What time is it in Mexico?

123
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:02,409
- What are you doing?
- Calling Cordelia.

124
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,389
- Why?
- Why?

125
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,700
- I don't want to ruin her holiday.
- Angel...

126
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,870
...don't you think
she'd want us to call?

127
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:16,169
- Shouldn't we tell her what happened?
- No.

128
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,409
- Angel--
- She'll be back soon...

129
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:23,200
...and she'll have presents
for Connor.

130
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,370
He's going to be here so she can
give them to him, okay?

131
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:34,139
Okay.

132
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,929
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,370
No.

134
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:50,440
This isn't working.

135
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:53,129
Forget about all this,
I've got to go.

136
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:59,899
- Did he just say to forget about this?
- Yeah, he did.

137
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:03,539
You don't think he's decided
to go deal with...

138
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:07,129
- ...those responsible, do you?
- We need to find Wesley.

139
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,940
Yeah.

140
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:26,090
Bro. Bro!

141
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:28,210
Are you alive?

142
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,539
Can you talk?

143
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,309
Muggers, bastards.

144
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:38,269
They leave you any I.D.?

145
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,960
This wasn't no mugging.

146
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,580
Now, you....

147
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,419
I talked to a couple of different
sources like you asked.

148
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:37,559
Angel, the news isn't good.

149
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:46,590
This Quor-toth dimension is....
Everyone I spoke to is afraid of it.

150
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:51,080
And these are not easily
rattled people, and that's not all.

151
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,289
The portal you saw opened
wasn't a portal.

152
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,240
There are no portals to Quor-toth.
The only way in...

153
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:01,980
...is to rip right through
the fabric of reality.

154
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,120
This isn't about an interdimensional
hot spot or conjuring an opening.

155
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:11,799
To get to Quor-toth would require
dark magics...

156
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:14,730
...the kind of power it takes
centuries to build.

157
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:18,220
I know this isn't easy for you,
but you gotta hear it.

158
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,240
Even if you get in,
finding Connor would be like...

159
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,629
...looking for a needle in
a haystack. The size of China.

160
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:30,250
Needles. Should have thought of that.

161
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,950
We don't have the resources
to conjure up that much dark power.

162
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:40,210
Oh, I think we do.

163
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:55,210
Angel?

164
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:58,100
- Who is this?
- Linwood Murrow.

165
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:03,110
Division president of Special
Projects at Wolfram and Hart.

166
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,399
- And you are?
- Deeply troubled.

167
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,330
You and Angel
have a lot in common...

168
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,820
...abducting an employee
of Wolfram and Hart.

169
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:18,950
Then again, he might be too troubled
to consider the consequences.

170
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,720
Once the firm finds out
what you've done--

171
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,580
They'd kill you
before they'd kill me.

172
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:27,690
Angel...

173
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:32,120
...this isn't a slimy demon you've
got trussed up here. He's human.

174
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,610
Marginally, but still, this won't
bring Connor back.

175
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,480
He better hope it does.

176
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,360
What are you doing?

177
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:44,970
At last count, the charges were
kidnapping, assault and battery and--

178
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,259
None of which I intend to press.

179
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,529
In fact...

180
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:01,769
...let's not press anything,
shall we?

181
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:04,360
Wanna find your son?

182
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:07,809
The full force and faith...

183
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:10,529
...of Wolfram and Hart
will be at your disposal.

184
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:15,429
Who is Sahjhan, and how do
I get my hands on him?

185
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:21,429
If you'll just hit 3
on my speed dial....

186
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:24,960
Cell phone in my jacket pocket.

187
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,269
Hello, Lilah?

188
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:37,850
I'm sending over a client...

189
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:41,440
...and listen carefully because
I have explicit instructions...

190
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:43,669
...on how to deal with him.

191
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,309
Give him anything he wants.

192
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:58,860
You should get a yard dog, because
anybody could just walk in.

193
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:04,509
- Getting in isn't the hard part.
- Is that what happened to Wes?

194
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,649
You lured him in,
made sure he couldn't get out?

195
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,139
He's a big boy.

196
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:11,960
- He knew what he was doing.
- Where is he?

197
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:14,320
- Why should I care?
- I'm telling you to.

198
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,600
Great, let's have more violence.
It's such a help.

199
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,730
We lost a child, you lost Holtz.
Isn't that enough already?

200
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,360
No.

201
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,179
So kill everybody?
That'll make you happy?

202
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:36,269
Oh. There is no happy for you.

203
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,879
You're all living in here together,
sharing everything.

204
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:48,350
Except taking out the trash, I guess.

205
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,639
I imagine losing Holtz
is like losing a father.

206
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,399
Or worse.

207
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,389
The trash.

208
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,569
I'll explain that later.

209
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:07,519
Time for you to go.

210
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,950
We won't go until
you tell us about Wes.

211
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,789
You're half right.
About the not going part.

212
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:23,960
No!

213
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,950
Wait!

214
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,349
Get the hell out of here.

215
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,200
Kidnapping Linwood. You're really
stepping up. The White Room.

216
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,839
They just don't talk about it.
I was here three years...

217
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,680
...before I heard of it.
Did he tell you what's in it?

218
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:00,019
- Answers. Up or down?
- Up.

219
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:10,150
He tell you how to get there?

220
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:13,890
A guy in Litigation
went to the White Room.

221
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,750
He's in an asylum now.

222
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:29,200
Wow. I should probably
hold on to that.

223
00:18:55,089 --> 00:18:56,279
Hello.

224
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:06,299
Angel. Lilah.

225
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:11,549
Your fingernails are pretty.
I love red.

226
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:14,890
You have a taste for red too.

227
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,779
And revenge.

228
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,759
I know.

229
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:22,000
So much more fun than forgiveness.
So, what's up?

230
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,940
- A demon, Sahjhan, has taken my son.
- Do you want your little baby back?

231
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,150
Baby's gone. You want Sahjhan.

232
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,140
Nowadays you can walk right
through them.

233
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:40,750
But in the past,
they were something else.

234
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,700
They were all about torture and death.

235
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,750
You can relate.
Well, they caused a lot of trouble.

236
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,240
Don't get me wrong. I like trouble,
but I hate chaos.

237
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,559
- So we changed them.
- You made them immaterial.

238
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,609
Smart boy.

239
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:14,769
Now they watch,
and they can no longer touch.

240
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:19,529
- How do you capture them?
- Well, there's your special urn.

241
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:27,829
They're expensive
and hard to come by.

242
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,789
But you don't want
his essence in a jar.

243
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:39,720
You want someone you can sink
your teeth into.

244
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,849
You know these things always come
with a price. Kill her.

245
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,329
That's good for now.

246
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,230
I see why they respect you.

247
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:01,349
Now, as to your demon made flesh...

248
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:04,960
...it's a big ritual, all here.

249
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,809
Can't wait to see how it turns out.

250
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:30,490
- Okay, throw me away.
- You want me to put you in the trash?

251
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,839
Either Wesley took the diaries,
or he tossed them.

252
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,000
We're lucky we got here
while it's still full.

253
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:37,910
Yeah.

254
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:49,690
God, somebody ate that?

255
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,829
- Any luck?
- Yes.

256
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:00,210
- You getting anywhere?
- He was meticulous.

257
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:04,750
He kept separate diaries for all the
major players: Darla, Connor, Angel.

258
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,369
And he's frightened.

259
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:10,410
What's he frightened of?

260
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:12,599
I'm not sure yet.

261
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,809
"Pending doom" sort of thing
in the later entries.

262
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,259
Some big prophecy he was
trying to repudiate.

263
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:22,900
It says here, "It can't be
coming. It can't be true."

264
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,519
That's doom-y.

265
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:28,230
I guess we're looking for
this prophecy.

266
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:31,410
- I just don't know where we're gonna--
- I do.

267
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:42,200
- "The father will kill the son."
- Wes thought Angel--

268
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,069
Was going to kill Connor.

269
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:52,829
Yes, and that's the prophecy!

270
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,390
Wesley couldn't accept it,
and he kept trying to disprove it...

271
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,039
...but the text and commentaries....

272
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,640
Everywhere he turned brought
him back to the same place.

273
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:06,940
This is great. I told you he had
a reason for taking Connor.

274
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:08,789
Yeah.

275
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:11,119
Wes did the right thing.

276
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,039
The only thing he could
do under the circumstances.

277
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:17,819
Now we have to find Angel
and tell him right away.

278
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:22,160
And he'll forgive Wesley for
giving his son to his mortal enemy?

279
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:25,019
Well...

280
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,599
...maybe begin to forgive.

281
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:33,750
Angel, please do not do this thing.
We'll find some other way.

282
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:35,630
There is no other way.

283
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:39,579
You know, not speaking would be
a really good look for you.

284
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:42,690
- How's that?
- It looks about right.

285
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,420
- What's next?
- Next, we reconsider this.

286
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,339
You're messing with primordial
powers of darkness.

287
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:51,690
Next.

288
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:54,170
Is this how you want
to get Connor?

289
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,170
What's next?

290
00:23:58,369 --> 00:23:59,880
Human blood.

291
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:54,329
"Corpus Granok Sahjhan Demonicus,"

292
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:17,099
Where is he?

293
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,640
Where is he?

294
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:33,619
What the--?

295
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,829
Hey, come on!

296
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,920
Now, this is more like it.

297
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:10,559
Lilah, do something!

298
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,799
Killing him isn't gonna
solve anything.

299
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,130
- You're wrong.
- We had a deal!

300
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,809
I gave you everything.
What more do you want?

301
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,900
- I want my son back!
- Lilah!

302
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,049
Whoa, flag on the play!

303
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,380
The tech team registered a bioplasmic
disturbance on National...

304
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,140
- ...the same time as the spell.
- Sahjhan?

305
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:33,180
It flipped a 2-ton truck like a toy.

306
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:41,150
- We need to talk.
- Not now.

307
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:44,259
- Fred.
- There's something you need to know--

308
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,519
The father will kill the son!

309
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:55,309
There's a prophecy
in the Nyazian scrolls.

310
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:59,849
Wes checked the translations. He went
to oracles. He couldn't disprove it.

311
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:01,839
They fed you Connor's blood.

312
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:05,049
You said it yourself,
he smelled like food.

313
00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:09,670
- Wesley tried to protect Connor.
- He was trying to protect you.

314
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,000
Same as we're doing right now.

315
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:19,019
- Angel, the prophecy.
- It's a lie. I'd never hurt Connor.

316
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:23,569
- How can you know that?
- I'd never hurt someone I care about.

317
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,119
Now, move.

318
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,859
- Let's go after him.
- We can't.

319
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,529
He lays a finger on you,
I'll have to kill him.

320
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,970
What are they doing here?

321
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,720
There was kidnapping. Dark magic.

322
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,730
It's bad, kids.

323
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,319
- He's gonna pay for this.
- Really bad.

324
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:13,240
Don't run off now.
The fun's just starting.

325
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:19,059
I'm not your boyfriend. Find someone
else to smack you around.

326
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:29,720
- It has to matter.
- He's not thinking about--

327
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,049
What the hell?

328
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,059
In the back. Get in the back.

329
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,569
- It's her.
- In Wesley's car. Let's go.

330
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:49,059
This way.

331
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,069
- You all right?
- I tried to stop. It's all my fault.

332
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:03,910
- Hey, what's your name?
- Al Stokely.

333
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,309
It's not even my truck.

334
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,450
Al, you wanna tell me
what happened?

335
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:14,220
I hit-- Oh, God.

336
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:18,599
- I hit a guy, a man.
- This man you hit, where is he?

337
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,160
I don't know. There's no way
he could have gotten up.

338
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,269
Oh, God, those poor people.

339
00:29:30,049 --> 00:29:31,730
You didn't do anything wrong.

340
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:34,799
It's all my fault.

341
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:39,079
No.

342
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,640
No, it isn't.

343
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,160
I knew you were meant for this.

344
00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:46,799
Where's Wes?

345
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,950
- He's not coming back.
- What?

346
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,220
It was all lies, every bit of it.

347
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,500
All he wanted was the kid.
To punish Angel.

348
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:01,789
- He never cared about anything else.
- I'm talking about Wesley.

349
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,519
His car's here. Where is he?

350
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:10,049
- We just want to hear his side.
- His side? His side's funny.

351
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,220
He sacrificed everything
he believed in to save that kid.

352
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:19,009
By helping Holtz take him to hell?
I wanna hear it from the horse's mouth.

353
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,759
- Your friend's innocent.
- Is he alive?

354
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,119
Where is he?
Will you just tell us?

355
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:32,400
Heaven, hell.

356
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:35,759
I slit his throat.

357
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,470
Stay down!

358
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:49,700
No.

359
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,210
I trusted the wrong man.

360
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,940
Take us to him,
and he better be alive!

361
00:32:12,329 --> 00:32:13,940
You call that a fight?

362
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,099
Let me show you how
we used to do it.

363
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:29,059
So. My home...

364
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,789
...uninvited guests.

365
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,319
- This can't end well.
- This is the guy, right?

366
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:37,140
Hi, Justine. I remember you.

367
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,279
One of Holtz's groupies.

368
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,279
You tried to cut off my head.

369
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:50,799
Can't tell you how much
I miss doing that.

370
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:55,140
I also miss gravity, friction...

371
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,069
...and smashing things to pieces.

372
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,670
- Let's start with your skulls.
- Or yours.

373
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,880
Angel.

374
00:33:13,049 --> 00:33:16,490
I'm guessing I have you to thank
for the mortal-coil thing.

375
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:20,210
Yeah.

376
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,839
I'll tell you what.

377
00:33:23,849 --> 00:33:26,690
Take me to the Quor-toth world,
help me find my son...

378
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,170
- ...we'll call it even.
- Really?

379
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:32,410
You and me, buddy cops?
Summer release?

380
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:36,150
We iron out our wacky differences
and bond? Don't think so.

381
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:39,369
- You're taking me.
- Couldn't if I wanted to.

382
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,329
- You're lying.
- No, that I'm telling the truth about.

383
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:44,839
Your kid's gone for good.

384
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:48,680
I can open the Quor-toth one time.
That's why I chose it.

385
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:51,960
Try again, the whole universe
could go kablooey.

386
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:55,740
- Bad for me, bad for America.
- What are you lying about?

387
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,130
Oh, well, I don't like to brag...

388
00:33:59,849 --> 00:34:02,309
...but read any good
prophecies lately?

389
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,930
- You wrote the prophecies.
- More a rewrite.

390
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:09,820
- The father will kill the son.
- Yeah.

391
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:14,019
I flitted back and forth in time,
changed the one that threatened me.

392
00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:18,289
Flitted in a manly way,
just so we're clear.

393
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,900
You're not my enemy. You're in my
home, and I'm gonna kick your ass.

394
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:26,480
But you were never really the point.

395
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:30,610
- It was Connor.
- Can't put one over on you, can you?

396
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,440
Oh, wait. Already did.

397
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,679
It's freaky to see
your name in a prophecy...

398
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,389
...all carved in blood
on an official scroll.

399
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:44,159
The one sired by the vampire with
a soul shall grow to manhood...

400
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,360
...and kill Sahjhan. Me!

401
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:49,840
You planted prophecies,
that Angel would kill his son...

402
00:34:50,849 --> 00:34:54,150
- ...and Wesley believed them.
- Thank God he had some spine.

403
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:57,780
Holtz was useless. He wanted
to raise your kid as his own.

404
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:02,760
I've got a knife over my heart for
1100 years and he's into petty revenge.

405
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:07,840
If he'd killed it while it was in its
mother, we could've avoided all this.

406
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:41,969
Do I look like I need
more skin problems?

407
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,730
Fred!

408
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,909
I had to put your boy down.

409
00:36:18,449 --> 00:36:20,800
Pity, kid had a big future.

410
00:36:21,449 --> 00:36:22,610
I mean, big.

411
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,989
Oh, well.
We all gotta go sometime.

412
00:36:29,849 --> 00:36:32,969
No. No!
Don't do that!

413
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,730
No!

414
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:46,360
Holtz left it.

415
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:49,710
What about Wesley?

416
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,500
The park next to his place...

417
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,110
...that's where I left him.

418
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,820
- Maybe she was lying.
- No, he was here.

419
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,940
How can you--?

420
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:11,809
Right. The blood.

421
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:14,559
We should get going.
Sun's coming up.

422
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,250
He can't be dead.

423
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,150
We'll keep looking.

424
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:25,110
Lorne's been calling
hospitals all night.

425
00:37:25,969 --> 00:37:27,829
We need to get you indoors, man.

426
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:29,739
We'll find him.

427
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:47,099
Hey, I cleaned the pentagram
as best I could.

428
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:51,010
The dried blood, well, that's
starting to be a look out there.

429
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:55,039
- Thanks.
- You know me. Like to keep busy.

430
00:37:58,369 --> 00:37:59,380
It's not right.

431
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:05,059
All I wanted was to get my hands
on Sahjhan.

432
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:08,659
- Fred and Gunn tried to keep me from--
- Going too far?

433
00:38:09,769 --> 00:38:12,050
- Nearly got them killed.
- Yeah, you did.

434
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,309
I'm glad it didn't work out that way.

435
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:20,949
You think Wesley is...?

436
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:23,099
I don't know.

437
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,849
I hope for the best.

438
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,269
You know, there's a bigger
picture here, Angel.

439
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,309
In that bigger picture,
there's a glass.

440
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:36,820
If "glass is half full" is about to
come out of your mouth, don't.

441
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:38,280
No.

442
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:41,519
No, this is more a glass
half-full of spiked blood.

443
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:44,800
If Sahjhan and the lawyer
pulled off their plan...

444
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:47,909
...you'd have Connor's blood
on your hands.

445
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,469
- Don't I anyway?
- No.

446
00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:53,659
Think you could have done more?
You did everything you could...

447
00:38:54,769 --> 00:38:57,469
...with the knowledge you had,
just like Wesley.

448
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:04,489
Maybe the way to start forgiving
yourself is by starting to forgive him.

449
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,250
Angel Invest-- Hey, Fred.

450
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:16,949
Yeah. They did?
And? And, okay, where?

451
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:21,650
Yeah, he's right here.
I'll tell him.

452
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:23,809
Okay, thanks.

453
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:25,820
They found Wesley?

454
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:35,280
Hey.

455
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,329
It's good you came, man.

456
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,679
- He ask for me?
- He can't speak yet.

457
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:44,559
Trachea's messed up, lost a lot
of blood. It's good you came.

458
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:48,130
He's not completely
out of the woods yet.

459
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:51,300
You being here can only help.

460
00:39:52,409 --> 00:39:53,599
Can I see him?

461
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,530
I'm sure he'd like that.

462
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,610
Hey, Wes.

463
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,550
I just....

464
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:41,420
I want you to know that
I understand why you did it.

465
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,420
I know about the prophecies...

466
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:48,300
...and I know how hard it must
have been for you to...

467
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,900
...do what you did.

468
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:56,309
You thought I was going to turn evil
and kill my son. I didn't.

469
00:40:57,809 --> 00:40:59,489
It's important you know that.

470
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:03,690
This isn't Angelus talking.
It's me, Angel.

471
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,360
You know that, right?

472
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,440
Good.

473
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,980
Son of a bitch! You're gonna pay!
You took my son!

474
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,489
You son of a bitch! Bastard!

475
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,610
Code blue, 319,

476
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,519
- Code blue, 319,
- Go!

477
00:41:25,409 --> 00:41:28,150
You think I forgive you?!
Never! You're gonna die!

478
00:41:28,409 --> 00:41:30,059
You're gonna pay!

479
00:41:31,409 --> 00:41:33,300
Hey! Hey!

480
00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:36,550
- You took my son! You took him!
- Stop it!

481
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:38,670
You took my son!

482
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,489
- Angel, stop!
- Never! I'll kill you!

483
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:44,869
- Come on, stop!
- You're a dead man, Pryce!

484
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:47,210
I'll kill you!

485
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:49,860
You're a dead man! Dead!

486
00:41:50,489 --> 00:41:51,469
Dead!
