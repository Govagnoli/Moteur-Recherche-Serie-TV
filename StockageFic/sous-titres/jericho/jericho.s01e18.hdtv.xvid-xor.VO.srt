Hello, Rob.

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,750
Someone on my team
sold us all out.

4
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:08,972
You’re smart enough to know that they
would say anything to get you to talk.

5
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:12,508
Get the package.

6
00:00:22,598 --> 00:00:24,527
In the last three months,
I remembered

7
00:00:24,548 --> 00:00:25,738
all the reasons...

8
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:27,783
why I needed you in my life.

9
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:28,934
So have I.

10
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:31,376
I've also remembered
why it can never work.

11
00:00:31,576 --> 00:00:33,876
I told Darcy she and the kids
can come stay with us.

12
00:00:33,892 --> 00:00:35,790
Thanks, Jimmy.
I appreciate that.

13
00:00:37,687 --> 00:00:39,056
<i>We have also received reports

14
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:41,922
<i>that the bombers gained
the trust of local officials

15
00:00:41,923 --> 00:00:45,092
<i>which allowed the terrorists
access to secure locations.

16
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:47,405
I’ve heard that voice before.

17
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,019
- That's the guy that does the
farm report.  - It’s real news.

18
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:52,753
<i>In New York, the terrorists
who were apprehended,

19
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:55,747
<i>were all carrying nearly perfect
fake FBI badges.

20
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,435
<i>- You're drunk.
- Yes, I am, Darcy.

21
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,990
<i>Yes, I am.

22
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:24,607
<i>What ?

23
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:41,198
What is it, Rob ?

24
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,155
Is all that really
worth it for 6 kids ?

25
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:13,364
Six kids in a conference room
is not Harvard, but it's a start.

26
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:14,989
I meant for you.

27
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:18,364
I think it's time we start trying
to get things back to normal.

28
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:20,259
To be honest with you,
if I'm a kid...

29
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:23,709
going to school isn't exactly high
on my list of priorities these days.

30
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:25,667
Hey, Jimmy.

31
00:03:26,842 --> 00:03:29,322
Hey, can I... borrow you for a few
minutes, I need your help.

32
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:31,472
I'm going to get you
a bat signal or something.

33
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,839
What's wrong ?

34
00:03:35,872 --> 00:03:38,588
You remember, last week on the
radio broadcast, they said that

35
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:41,521
terrorists used fake FBI badges
to move through security ?

36
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:44,171
I've seen one of those badges.

37
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,356
Where ?

38
00:03:48,656 --> 00:03:51,485
I never went to Law school,
but I'm going to go ahead and guess.

39
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:54,017
- This is breaking and entering.
- It's called probable cause.

40
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:56,051
It's called paranoïd
abuse of authority.

41
00:03:56,435 --> 00:03:58,952
Come on, let's go... before he
comes home and catches you...

42
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:00,535
prying up his floorboards.

43
00:04:00,868 --> 00:04:02,535
The terrorists had FBI badges...

44
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:04,817
Robert Hawkins has an FBI badge.

45
00:04:05,134 --> 00:04:06,634
You think that's just coïncidence ?

46
00:04:06,717 --> 00:04:08,134
Maybe he's FBI !

47
00:04:08,276 --> 00:04:09,726
Please, tell me you thought of that.

48
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:12,601
I did...
and I asked his family.

49
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:14,601
And they all say he's FBI.

50
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:17,934
But... when they said it they all
had this look on their face like...

51
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:20,317
there was something that
they weren't saying.

52
00:04:21,587 --> 00:04:23,903
Sort of like the look I've got
on my face right now.

53
00:04:24,003 --> 00:04:26,653
Look, I had a hunch,
and I was right.

54
00:04:26,845 --> 00:04:28,495
Now, he's out on patrol...

55
00:04:28,595 --> 00:04:30,628
he's not going to be back
for a while, so...

56
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:32,503
Come on !

57
00:04:42,602 --> 00:04:44,235
Did you bust this lock open ?

58
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:58,108
You know, this is kinda
weird, but...

59
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,558
if he's FBI, isn't this what
his basement would look like ?

60
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,309
That's... that's what I said...

61
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:08,459
until I saw this.

62
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:16,598
- Does Gray know about this ?
- No.

63
00:05:16,798 --> 00:05:19,739
I wanted to get a second opinion
before I told anyone.

64
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:22,432
What do you want to do ?

65
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:13,759
Don't.

66
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:25,431

71
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:45,749
Hand it over.

72
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,049
Nice and slow.

73
00:06:52,155 --> 00:06:53,688
Slide it over.

74
00:06:57,877 --> 00:06:59,289
What the hell are
you doing here ?

75
00:06:59,306 --> 00:07:01,422
Did you wipe out 23
American cities ?

76
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:03,830
- Get out of my house.
- Answer the question !

77
00:07:03,864 --> 00:07:06,747
- Why would you even think that ?
- You've got a working generator...

78
00:07:06,781 --> 00:07:08,197
and a food supply.

79
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,453
So like you knew the
attacks were coming.

80
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,827
- I'm gonna give you 10 seconds...
- Back up !

81
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:14,200
Jimmy knows I'm here.

82
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:15,893
If I don't call him off
when he gets back...

83
00:07:15,907 --> 00:07:18,323
you're gonna have a lot more
people than me to deal with.

84
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,290
I'm an FBI agent, Jake.

85
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:22,073
That's what I heard.

86
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,796
Problem is the radio was reporting
the terrorists used

87
00:07:24,797 --> 00:07:27,804
forged FBI badges to get
their bombs into position.

88
00:07:28,871 --> 00:07:30,204
What is that room ?

89
00:07:31,673 --> 00:07:33,740
How were you involved
in all of this ?

90
00:07:34,923 --> 00:07:36,290
I need to know.

91
00:07:40,107 --> 00:07:42,807
5 months ago, this was
a map of our country.

92
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:45,090
Now, it's an antique.

93
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:48,565
It's a picture of the way
things used to be.

94
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,183
Right now...

95
00:07:53,744 --> 00:07:55,460
all we're sure of is this.

96
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,127
But this is where we
start to rebuild.

97
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:02,024
So how do we do it ?

98
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,390
How ?

99
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:06,324
We look to our history.

100
00:08:06,707 --> 00:08:09,174
We study the people
that came before us.

101
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:13,390
- Are you going to take attendance ?
- No.

102
00:08:15,856 --> 00:08:17,123
Where are you going ?

103
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,736
My mom's at home right now...

104
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,936
trying to grow beets out of our
bathtub so we can eat newt month.

105
00:08:22,804 --> 00:08:24,887
This stuff...
isn't important.

106
00:08:37,771 --> 00:08:39,671
I guess school's out
early today.

107
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,487
You don't have to stay
if you don't want to.

108
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,919
I don't think I should be hanging
around at home right now.

109
00:08:49,157 --> 00:08:50,973
So, I guess I'm stuck here.

110
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,615
<i>So it's come to this...

111
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,407
I want you to know this has nothing
to do with you personnally, I'm...

112
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
sure you're...

113
00:09:00,323 --> 00:09:01,323
wonderfull.

114
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:05,873
But let's be honest here, you're
the one that lays the fewest eggs

115
00:09:05,874 --> 00:09:08,689
and I distinctly told all of you
that this was going to happen.

116
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,781
I believe I made myself perfectly
clear in that regard.

117
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:13,605
All right.

118
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:15,972
The thing is...

119
00:09:17,105 --> 00:09:19,205
If you knew me at all,
you would...

120
00:09:19,688 --> 00:09:21,155
see how really funny this is,

121
00:09:21,172 --> 00:09:23,005
because this is so not my thing.

122
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:24,972
No... this is Stanley's thing.

123
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:28,622
It's just... I'm awfully hungry.

124
00:09:28,705 --> 00:09:32,405
And... I don't want to get into the
whole circle of life business, but...

125
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,972
I just cannot eat anymore sprouts.

126
00:09:37,014 --> 00:09:39,264
OK ? Enough stalling...
Here we go...

127
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,130
Here's my concern...

128
00:09:43,197 --> 00:09:45,680
I've heard stories about how you're
gonna react to this, and

129
00:09:45,705 --> 00:09:49,105
if I see half of you running around,
well I just know I'm gonna freak out.

130
00:09:49,117 --> 00:09:52,526
So if you could do your best
to minimize that part of it...

131
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:54,667
I'd just really appreciate it.

132
00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:01,525
Sprouts it is.

133
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,070
You really out here
looking for deer?

134
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:31,152
Thought they were all gone.

135
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:32,428
What do you want Harry ?

136
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:35,990
Do you think you could come
into city hall today ?

137
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:37,405
Gray’s still out, and
it’d be nice to have...

138
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:39,256
somebody around who knows
what they're doing.

139
00:10:39,268 --> 00:10:42,768
Not my job anymore, and get lost,
I'm trying to shoot some deer.

140
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:44,731
Just be for a day or two.

141
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,614
You're starting to look an
awful lot like a deer, Harry.

142
00:10:59,854 --> 00:11:02,154
I've been in the FBI
for 15 years.

143
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:07,421
I worked law enforcement after college,
and then I joined the bureau.

144
00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:08,571
Where did you go to school ?

145
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:10,621
Georgetown, you wanna see my ring ?

146
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,954
The FBI, what were
you working on ?

147
00:11:14,036 --> 00:11:16,136
I was sent here to monitor
the phone calls

148
00:11:16,137 --> 00:11:19,252
made in the area to a...
suspected terrorist cell.

149
00:11:20,086 --> 00:11:21,952
- And what did you find out ?
- Nothing.

150
00:11:22,002 --> 00:11:23,219
Trail went dead.

151
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:24,886
We about done here ?

152
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:27,641
Not even close.

153
00:11:28,174 --> 00:11:30,891
Tell me about her...
Sarah Mason.

154
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:33,174
She's gone.

155
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,862
You're pretty thorough.

156
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,812
Also took care of the one
in the cabinet

157
00:11:46,902 --> 00:11:48,685
and the one behind
the water heater.

158
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:51,918
There's only one loaded
gun in this house...

159
00:11:52,402 --> 00:11:54,085
and it's mine.
Sit down.

160
00:11:59,354 --> 00:12:00,921
Arms behind you.

161
00:12:06,604 --> 00:12:08,271
Tell me about Sarah.

162
00:12:09,053 --> 00:12:11,836
Jimmy said she was also
a cop in St Louis.

163
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:14,619
She's working with you ?

164
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,136
Against you ?

165
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:19,119
Who are these people ?

166
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:21,219
You are making a serious mistake.

167
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:24,546
- I am a Federal Officer.
- Really ?

168
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:26,979
Really sure you're not.

169
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:31,213
Robert Willer...
State Department.

170
00:12:31,938 --> 00:12:34,721
How about Robert Snyder...
Colombus PD ?

171
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:38,738
Commander Robert Richmond...
Naval Intelligence.

172
00:12:40,203 --> 00:12:43,153
None of those are real...
and neither is that badge.

173
00:12:43,636 --> 00:12:45,103
Who the hell are you ?

174
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:46,944
Who do you you work for ?

175
00:12:52,716 --> 00:12:55,099
You do not wanna know
what I know.

176
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,166
- I think I can handle it.
- Really ?

177
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,666
Cause I can barely handle it,
and I was trained for this.

178
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:02,707
You want to tell me...
or you tell the whole town.

179
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:08,752
All right.

180
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:12,502
But once you hear this...

181
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,916
You are a part of it, Jake,
and there is no going back.

182
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:18,483
Who do you work for ?

183
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:21,916
CIA.

184
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:26,816
Sarah Mason and I were part of
an off-the-books team.

185
00:13:27,231 --> 00:13:29,781
We were tracking the bombs
used in the attack.

186
00:13:29,964 --> 00:13:32,131
Where did they come from...
the bombs ?

187
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:34,381
The US government
brought them in.

188
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,997
See, after the Soviet Union fell...

189
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:41,014
neglected military in the
satellite republics started

190
00:13:41,015 --> 00:13:43,610
selling their nuclear stockpiles
on the black market.

191
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:46,348
So the CIA started
an operation...

192
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:49,877
get that material by any
and all means necessary.

193
00:13:50,477 --> 00:13:52,727
But a few years ago, a shipment
disappeared on its way

194
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:55,768
to the DOE storage complex
in Oak Ridge.

195
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,651
And that is where my
CIA team came in.

196
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,730
Why you ?

197
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:01,463
I'm the best at what I do.

198
00:14:01,897 --> 00:14:03,113
And what is that ?

199
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:05,997
Satellite installation.

200
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,842
I have a 2 o'clock appointment
with Mr. Higgins.

201
00:14:32,944 --> 00:14:36,061
I've been inside all day.
How's the weather out there ?

202
00:14:37,228 --> 00:14:38,828
You know, it looks like rain.

203
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:47,508
Thank you.

204
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:00,879
- Hello Victor.
- Hawkins.

205
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,962
I believe you know
everyone here...

206
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:06,349
except this young lady.

207
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:10,266
- Robert Hawkins.
- Sarah Mason.

208
00:15:10,816 --> 00:15:12,582
All right, let's get down to it.

209
00:15:12,982 --> 00:15:14,866
We have a lot of
ground to cover.

210
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:18,799
As most of you know...

211
00:15:18,982 --> 00:15:21,932
a shipment of nukes from
project Red Bell is missing.

212
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,172
What you don't know...

213
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:26,705
is that we have quality intel
that those warheads...

214
00:15:26,764 --> 00:15:29,197
have been converted
into 25 small...

215
00:15:29,614 --> 00:15:31,197
high yield devices.

216
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:34,371
These bombs have been
dissiminated to extremists cells

217
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:36,655
active within the United States.

218
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:40,421
So, is this Al Qaeda ?

219
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:42,444
I wish it were that simple.

220
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,528
It's much larger than that.

221
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,594
It's a cross section of
domestic militias...

222
00:15:47,694 --> 00:15:50,094
anarchists,
and religious fanatics.

223
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:53,327
As you can see,
these are terrorists...

224
00:15:53,443 --> 00:15:56,760
that would never collaborate,
ideologically or politically.

225
00:15:56,893 --> 00:15:58,959
The only thing that links
them, is the desire

226
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,977
to take down the
federal government.

227
00:16:01,343 --> 00:16:04,160
Our job, is to get undercover
in these cells...

228
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:06,218
and find these bombs.

229
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:08,368
So who do we think
is orchestrating this ?

230
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:10,504
The agency's been at this
from every angle...

231
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:13,587
and all we know is that
he's got deep ressources,

232
00:16:13,712 --> 00:16:16,045
an ability to coordinate
diverse groups,

233
00:16:16,511 --> 00:16:19,445
and by all indications...
he's an American.

234
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:26,379
We were broken up
into groups of two.

235
00:16:27,204 --> 00:16:30,121
Each unit was...
assigned a terrorist cell.

236
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,640
One agent went undercover,
one acted as a handler.

237
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:37,940
You can't expect me to believe
you were sent here...

238
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:38,972
undercover.

239
00:16:38,973 --> 00:16:40,623
What's so special
about this place ?

240
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,744
You know, I would
show you, but...

241
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:45,461
That's clever.

242
00:16:46,746 --> 00:16:48,946
It's over there...
behind the map.

243
00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:08,645
Where did you get this ?

244
00:17:08,757 --> 00:17:13,090
Those are defense department projections
they've been doing since the 50s.

245
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:17,690
The fallout scenarios in the event of
a nuclear attack on 20 US cities.

246
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,440
And you see Jericho ?

247
00:17:19,844 --> 00:17:21,894
It's outside the fallout zones, Jake.

248
00:17:22,094 --> 00:17:23,959
It's got a salt mine,
plenty of farm land,

249
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,210
and access to an untainted
water table.

250
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:28,185
So you weren't here to
monitor phone calls ?

251
00:17:28,202 --> 00:17:30,885
Jericho was a rally-point in case
we failed in our mission.

252
00:17:31,045 --> 00:17:32,045
Failed ?

253
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:34,312
Or succeeded ?

254
00:17:37,512 --> 00:17:39,512
And Johnston, was...

255
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:43,747
He wanted to come,
I know he did.

256
00:17:44,347 --> 00:17:47,347
He's just having a hard time
dealing with things lately.

257
00:17:47,914 --> 00:17:49,664
He always gets quiet...

258
00:17:50,097 --> 00:17:52,163
when he's going through
something, but...

259
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:54,313
just wish I could think
of something

260
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,363
to help him get through this.

261
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,165
We miss you, sweetheart.

262
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,711
There's no more sprouts.

263
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:18,445
You finished them ?

264
00:18:19,128 --> 00:18:20,128
I was hungry.

265
00:18:22,158 --> 00:18:24,958
What are you doing here, Sean.
It's like 9:30 in the morning...

266
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:25,975
Oh, my...

267
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:28,841
You slept here ?

268
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:32,308
Well, actually... there was not a
lot of sleeping going on.

269
00:18:33,641 --> 00:18:34,858
Get out of the house !

270
00:18:42,743 --> 00:18:43,784
What are you doing ?

271
00:18:43,851 --> 00:18:46,218
- You let him spend a night ?
- Yes.

272
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:49,584
Well that doesn't seem like something
Stanley would approve of, does it ?

273
00:18:49,674 --> 00:18:51,257
Stanley's not here.

274
00:18:54,474 --> 00:18:58,441
Just like that. You infiltrated a
terror cell planning a nuclear attack ?

275
00:18:59,532 --> 00:19:00,532
Yeah...

276
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:03,029
just like that.

277
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:05,466
It took me 2 years.

278
00:19:06,382 --> 00:19:07,782
8 months of it in prison...

279
00:19:07,832 --> 00:19:10,049
developing contacts,
getting into the network.

280
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:13,557
The only outside person I
communicated with was my handler.

281
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,349
After prison,
I spent another year

282
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:17,757
trying to gain their trust
on the outside.

283
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,274
And even then, I was only
scratching the surface.

284
00:19:20,307 --> 00:19:21,307
But you got in.

285
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,390
How ?

286
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:27,774
They were looking for
high grade government IDs.

287
00:19:29,974 --> 00:19:31,407
You gave them their badges !

288
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,637
I had to proove that I was loyal
and valuable to the cell, Jake.

289
00:19:34,704 --> 00:19:36,954
- I think I've heard enough.
- No !

290
00:19:37,054 --> 00:19:38,937
You barely scratched
the surface.

291
00:19:40,737 --> 00:19:42,403
You're the one who
wanted to hear this,

292
00:19:42,762 --> 00:19:44,754
so why don't you hear it all ?

293
00:19:58,386 --> 00:20:00,315
The cell was looking for IDs.

294
00:20:01,505 --> 00:20:04,609
And I needed to get higher up
in their organisation.

295
00:20:04,988 --> 00:20:07,313
So I let it be known
that I had a source.

296
00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:08,996
See, the badges...

297
00:20:09,012 --> 00:20:12,162
were going to be tagged so that
my team could track them.

298
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:16,370
They sent me to make the buy
with another cell member.

299
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:18,751
It was a kid named Daryl.

300
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,618
How do we know
these are real ?

301
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:22,434
They're real enough.

302
00:20:22,818 --> 00:20:23,989
Where did you get them from ?

303
00:20:24,101 --> 00:20:26,484
How and where I got these
badges... is my business.

304
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,851
What you do with them...
is yours.

305
00:20:44,656 --> 00:20:47,039
- Nice doing business with you.
- You too.

306
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:52,239
We should celebrate, man.
Go out, get some girls.

307
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:56,276
Except you don't really seem
like the type. All serious.

308
00:20:56,493 --> 00:20:57,626
Are you married ?

309
00:20:58,176 --> 00:20:59,184
I was.

310
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:01,643
Really ?
What happened ?

311
00:21:03,134 --> 00:21:04,634
What the hell is going on ?

312
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:12,499
Hold it right there !

313
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,332
I'm sorry man.

314
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:18,649
You gotta be kidding me.

315
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,207
FBI !
Hands in the air !

316
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,440
Back against the car.

317
00:21:33,109 --> 00:21:35,676
<i>It turns out Daryl was
an FBI informant.

318
00:21:36,242 --> 00:21:39,392
But my handler got me out,
and we kept my cover intact.

319
00:21:39,956 --> 00:21:43,440
So the FBI have an informant
in my target cell.

320
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,756
And they can't tell us
anything about that ?

321
00:21:45,823 --> 00:21:48,290
You know, I'm damn lucky
that my cover wasn't blown.

322
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,840
- Your cover's intact, yes ?
- Yeah, we believe so.

323
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:52,145
Then let's move on.

324
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:55,379
Have you been able to make contact
with those coordinating the attack ?

325
00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:58,795
No... but at this stage, I recommend
that we take down the cells

326
00:21:58,796 --> 00:22:00,162
that we've already inflitrated.

327
00:22:00,212 --> 00:22:03,029
You know, at the very least that
would disrupt the overall plan...

328
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,638
maybe delay it for...
- How many of the bombs can you get ?

329
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,970
A third, for sure...
half if we're lucky.

330
00:22:11,953 --> 00:22:13,186
Look... I know...

331
00:22:13,187 --> 00:22:16,403
it's not ideal, but at this stage,
it is the safest move.

332
00:22:16,445 --> 00:22:18,062
That's still a dozen
bombs in play.

333
00:22:19,086 --> 00:22:21,602
- What are you doing ?
- I just think there's a way to...

334
00:22:21,736 --> 00:22:23,936
speed this up and get
all the bombs at once.

335
00:22:23,937 --> 00:22:26,386
- Yeah, and we agreed that...
- Do you mind ?

336
00:22:29,272 --> 00:22:32,622
I think there may be a way
to get us further inside.

337
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:37,155
My partner tells the cell leader
that Daryl is the FBI informant.

338
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:40,806
That gives him the credibility
that he needs to move up faster.

339
00:22:41,022 --> 00:22:42,955
Then let us handle the FBI...

340
00:22:43,189 --> 00:22:46,055
and do whatever is necessary
to save the operation.

341
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:50,909
- It's all gonna take some time,
but we're close  - OK.

342
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:54,693
We're counting on you,
and you know the risks.

343
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,708
You'd better be right about this.

344
00:23:08,998 --> 00:23:10,864
This is the right way to go.

345
00:23:17,281 --> 00:23:18,281
Trust me.

346
00:23:27,047 --> 00:23:28,480
What would you have done ?

347
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,530
Stayed in,
or pulled the plug ?

348
00:23:30,546 --> 00:23:32,771
It seems like the wrong
question to me.

349
00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:36,991
I'd ask myself how much
I trusted my partner.

350
00:23:58,018 --> 00:24:01,909
Well, if I can sneak up here without
you so much as turning around...

351
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:04,209
how are you gonna
hear any game ?

352
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,000
I heard you half a mile
back in those shoes.

353
00:24:08,521 --> 00:24:11,071
You said you'd come with me
to see April today.

354
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:15,121
Fine.

355
00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:18,921
You coming home for dinner ?

356
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:27,028
There are no deer in these woods,
they've all been picked clean.

357
00:24:27,494 --> 00:24:29,661
Then, I guess I'll
be here a while.

358
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,527
I never wanted to be a mom'.

359
00:24:45,293 --> 00:24:46,727
I didn't sign up for this.

360
00:24:47,635 --> 00:24:50,419
You know what, you're right.
I owe it to Stanley.

361
00:24:50,685 --> 00:24:52,569
So I'm just gonna have
to jump in...

362
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:55,893
with both feet, whether she wants
to hear from me or not.

363
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,406
Listen to me going on
about my own problems.

364
00:24:59,407 --> 00:25:02,757
You must be ady to take this hatchet
and do the damn job yourself.

365
00:25:25,197 --> 00:25:27,214
I didn't know that he
knew how to sign.

366
00:25:28,705 --> 00:25:30,038
What did he say to you ?

367
00:25:30,555 --> 00:25:31,805
Never mind, look...

368
00:25:31,871 --> 00:25:33,205
That boy's bad news.

369
00:25:33,455 --> 00:25:35,405
Now, I can't stop you
from seeing him...

370
00:25:35,472 --> 00:25:39,138
but he is no longer welcome in this
house, do you understand me ?

371
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:54,339
Allison...

372
00:25:54,622 --> 00:25:57,289
so why do you feel like you
can't hang out at home ?

373
00:25:59,202 --> 00:26:01,252
You don't have to talk to me
if you don't want to.

374
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,066
It's not that I don't wanna
talk about it.

375
00:26:03,216 --> 00:26:04,216
It's just...

376
00:26:04,866 --> 00:26:06,250
my family's pretty weird.

377
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,883
My family was pretty weird too.

378
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:11,883
In fact, when I was your age, I didn't
want to hang out with them either.

379
00:26:11,974 --> 00:26:13,040
What about now ?

380
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,490
They're gone.

381
00:26:19,034 --> 00:26:21,133
There's this thing that went
down at my house...

382
00:26:21,184 --> 00:26:22,434
a couple weeks ago.

383
00:26:24,942 --> 00:26:26,009
I did something.

384
00:26:26,897 --> 00:26:28,997
OK. What did you do ?

385
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,413
I did something that...
can't be forgiven.

386
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,679
Now my mom just keeps...

387
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:39,429
looking at me.

388
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,844
Like I've changed into some kind
of monster, or something.

389
00:26:47,377 --> 00:26:48,977
You know you haven't, right ?

390
00:26:53,054 --> 00:26:55,378
So... even though you
weren't sure about the plan,

391
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:57,504
you outed the informant
to the cell leader.

392
00:26:58,546 --> 00:27:00,646
Once we decided to leave
the bombs in play,

393
00:27:00,647 --> 00:27:03,212
it was the only way for me to
get deep enough into the cell

394
00:27:03,213 --> 00:27:04,446
and gain their trust.

395
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:07,079
I told the cell leader that
Daryl was the informant,

396
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:09,829
but I wanted to get him out of there
before they killed him.

397
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:12,262
Come on, grab what you
need and let's go.

398
00:27:13,145 --> 00:27:15,712
They're gonna hunt me down,
and they're gonna kill me.

399
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:17,236
It's your lucky day, Daryl.

400
00:27:17,237 --> 00:27:19,770
They're gonna get you into witness
protection, so don't worry.

401
00:27:19,786 --> 00:27:21,636
We're gonna get
you out of here.

402
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:24,919
Stay there.

403
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:32,333
- Damn it !
- What is it ?

404
00:27:32,749 --> 00:27:34,483
<i>Daryl, we just wanna talk.

405
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:35,933
The cell leader.

406
00:28:05,488 --> 00:28:07,172
You gotta get me
out of this place.

407
00:28:07,205 --> 00:28:08,205
Run !

408
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:09,772
I'll tell them that
you got away.

409
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:12,738
I think my leg is broken.
Please, help me !

410
00:28:13,854 --> 00:28:16,238
Or I'm gonna tell them
who you really are.

411
00:28:18,938 --> 00:28:19,938
I'm sorry.

412
00:28:55,002 --> 00:28:57,069
<i>So, I finally gain their trust.

413
00:28:57,889 --> 00:28:58,989
<i>I was in.

414
00:29:01,662 --> 00:29:02,679
You killed him.

415
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,300
It was either killed him...

416
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:12,950
or possibly let millions
of people die.

417
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:14,250
They died anyway.

418
00:29:37,564 --> 00:29:38,564
<i>Jake ?

419
00:29:38,931 --> 00:29:40,331
<i>You're still down there ?

420
00:29:40,664 --> 00:29:41,664
Call him off.

421
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:44,814
You're not helping your cause by
keeping that gun in my face.

422
00:29:44,898 --> 00:29:45,981
<i>Hey, Jake ?

423
00:29:46,164 --> 00:29:48,098
Do not make me kill him Jake.

424
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:51,414
All right.

425
00:29:54,231 --> 00:29:55,764
- All right !
<i>- Jake ?

426
00:30:02,504 --> 00:30:03,654
What's going on, Jake ?

427
00:30:03,771 --> 00:30:05,537
We need a little more
time, that's all.

428
00:30:05,545 --> 00:30:08,121
- You're sure ?
- Yeah, we're all right.

429
00:30:09,883 --> 00:30:12,133
- I... I'm out front.
- OK.

430
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:27,401
Turn around, Jake.

431
00:30:43,947 --> 00:30:45,880
It is not about this anymore.

432
00:30:46,496 --> 00:30:47,496
We're past this.

433
00:30:50,037 --> 00:30:51,937
Starting now,
we trust each other.

434
00:30:53,487 --> 00:30:55,387
You need to tell me everything.

435
00:30:55,537 --> 00:30:56,545
Done telling.

436
00:30:57,004 --> 00:30:58,328
Now, I gotta show you.

437
00:31:09,628 --> 00:31:10,878
What are you doing here ?

438
00:31:11,011 --> 00:31:12,944
It's your first day
at a new school.

439
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:17,914
You know, the last time you had one
of those, Sam was in diapers.

440
00:31:20,564 --> 00:31:23,048
Doesn'’t look like you
had a big turnout.

441
00:31:23,588 --> 00:31:26,038
No, most people left early.

442
00:31:26,204 --> 00:31:28,288
I guess you knew better.

443
00:31:30,668 --> 00:31:33,834
I figured you didn't really want
me around the house anyway.

444
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:38,068
Why would you say that ?

445
00:31:41,136 --> 00:31:42,136
You know...

446
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:43,869
because of what I did.

447
00:31:47,369 --> 00:31:48,702
Allison, I love you.

448
00:31:49,536 --> 00:31:51,269
OK ? Nothing will
change that.

449
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:54,291
Hear me baby ?

450
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:57,125
Nothing will change that.

451
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,125
My little girl.

452
00:32:03,903 --> 00:32:06,970
Mom, please
don't be mad at me.

453
00:32:08,087 --> 00:32:09,637
I'm so sorry, mom'.

454
00:32:24,432 --> 00:32:26,499
- Here's the part I don't get.
- What ?

455
00:32:26,532 --> 00:32:28,532
If you're telling the truth...

456
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:30,815
you made it.

457
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:34,615
You made it deep inside the cell,
you gained their trust.

458
00:32:35,231 --> 00:32:36,231
Right.

459
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:38,314
Then, what happened ?

460
00:32:41,364 --> 00:32:43,481
Somebody tipped off the
terrorists, Jake.

461
00:32:44,786 --> 00:32:46,503
Before we could find out who...

462
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,770
<i>the terrorists moved up
their plan.

463
00:32:50,358 --> 00:32:51,691
Victor ?

464
00:32:51,774 --> 00:32:54,382
We made a mistake,
<i>a very big mistake.</i>

465
00:32:55,424 --> 00:32:58,074
This is the moment we prepared for.

466
00:32:58,635 --> 00:33:02,118
Strike will go off tomorrow,
at precisely 8:05 Eastern.

467
00:33:03,968 --> 00:33:05,568
OK. No... listen !

468
00:33:05,635 --> 00:33:06,635
The trucks...

469
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,185
they're white.

470
00:33:08,318 --> 00:33:12,801
License plate
Kansas, 5-4-3, George, Union, Ida...

471
00:33:13,301 --> 00:33:15,235
<i>I tried to warn the agency...

472
00:33:15,635 --> 00:33:17,035
<i>but we were too late.

473
00:33:21,896 --> 00:33:24,096
Some of the bombs were meant
for New York.

474
00:33:24,225 --> 00:33:26,009
We managed to head them off.

475
00:33:31,425 --> 00:33:33,358
Even after 4 years of work...

476
00:33:33,774 --> 00:33:35,708
I couldn't stop all of them.

477
00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:40,705
<i>I'm gonna have to live with that
for the rest of my life.

478
00:33:58,173 --> 00:33:59,940
Since when have
you been funny ?

479
00:34:00,107 --> 00:34:01,774
I have always been funny.

480
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,974
Yeah, not for a long time.

481
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,145
What is it Rob ?

482
00:34:23,029 --> 00:34:24,829
- Rob ?
- I won't be long.

483
00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:36,226
Not interrupting, am I ?

484
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:38,376
You know you are.

485
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,207
You're not exactly
returning our calls.

486
00:34:41,231 --> 00:34:42,965
I told my wife I was done.

487
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,165
I promised her, Victor.

488
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,443
- We need you back.
- Why me ?

489
00:34:49,577 --> 00:34:51,177
Because you're the best
at what you do.

490
00:34:51,193 --> 00:34:52,377
Which is what ?

491
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,310
Your family will be there,
when you get back.

492
00:34:58,759 --> 00:35:00,276
Team is meeting tomorrow.

493
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,000
Come listen to what this
is all about.

494
00:35:03,317 --> 00:35:05,208
If you wanna walk
away after that...

495
00:35:05,542 --> 00:35:06,542
you walk away.

496
00:35:11,374 --> 00:35:12,574
2 o'clock...

497
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:14,241
tomorrow.

498
00:35:15,058 --> 00:35:18,024
Tell the desk jockey you have an
appointment with Mr. Higgins.

499
00:35:19,091 --> 00:35:21,191
If they ask about the weather...

500
00:35:22,158 --> 00:35:23,824
tell hem it's gonna rain.

501
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:32,019
Who was that ?

502
00:35:42,788 --> 00:35:45,488
I might need to go
to a meeting tomorow.

503
00:35:47,321 --> 00:35:49,288
I can't keep doing this,
I can't.

504
00:35:50,788 --> 00:35:51,921
We'll be fine, D.

505
00:36:09,077 --> 00:36:10,077
What is that ?

506
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,177
It's the end of the
rabbit hole, Jake.

507
00:36:17,032 --> 00:36:18,566
Gimme a hand with this.

508
00:36:31,209 --> 00:36:32,743
So you believe me now ?

509
00:36:43,683 --> 00:36:45,549
Is that what I think it is ?

510
00:36:46,883 --> 00:36:49,549
It was meant for Columbus, Ohio.

511
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:53,503
You brought a nuclear bomb...
here.

512
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,603
What would you have
done with it ?

513
00:36:57,253 --> 00:36:58,920
What do you gonna do with it ?

514
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,274
I'm gonna keep it safe.

515
00:37:03,524 --> 00:37:06,124
I'm gonna keep it secret,
you know. Because...

516
00:37:07,361 --> 00:37:11,161
it gives the town some power, Jake,
but it also makes them a target.

517
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:12,427
Look...

518
00:37:14,788 --> 00:37:16,454
I know what you're thinking...

519
00:37:16,654 --> 00:37:19,421
You're wishing you'd walked away
when I gave you the chance, right ?

520
00:37:19,422 --> 00:37:21,916
Why didn’t you show me thing
when I walked in the door today.

521
00:37:21,917 --> 00:37:23,288
You didn't walk in.

522
00:37:24,268 --> 00:37:25,277
<i>Jake ?

523
00:37:27,327 --> 00:37:28,340
<i>Hey, Jake ?

524
00:37:30,952 --> 00:37:32,514
I've been watching you, Jake...

525
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:34,264
and you can handle yourself.

526
00:37:34,381 --> 00:37:36,848
And I've seen what a help
you have been to this stown.

527
00:37:36,893 --> 00:37:39,010
But I needed to know
that I can trust you.

528
00:37:39,143 --> 00:37:41,860
That you could handle it
if I told you everything.

529
00:37:42,726 --> 00:37:43,726
<i>Jake ?

530
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:47,176
This bomb...

531
00:37:48,648 --> 00:37:50,048
it's our burden, now.

532
00:37:51,115 --> 00:37:52,715
Whatever happens next...

533
00:37:52,948 --> 00:37:55,698
that is gonna be
up to you. OK ?

534
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:21,465
He's FBI.

535
00:38:22,298 --> 00:38:23,498
Just like he said.

536
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:25,215
But...

537
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:27,515
We're in good hands.

538
00:38:29,065 --> 00:38:30,403
That's good to hear.

539
00:38:31,655 --> 00:38:33,875
I'm sorry about all this,
Mr. Hawkins.

540
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,724
We do that, outside.

541
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:05,026
I didn't know that.

542
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:10,781
There’s something
I want to say to you.

543
00:39:11,906 --> 00:39:13,300
I'm still learning...

544
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:15,623
so just, please bear with me.

545
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:25,265
Stanley...
is...

546
00:39:26,168 --> 00:39:28,801
important...
to me.

547
00:39:30,512 --> 00:39:34,744
You... are...
important... to me.

548
00:39:36,946 --> 00:39:42,262
I... want... you...
to be safe.

549
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:48,521
So please... be patient...
with me.

550
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:50,663
I'm trying...

551
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,784
I'll try too.

552
00:39:57,384 --> 00:39:58,391
So...

553
00:39:59,475 --> 00:40:00,481
hug ?

554
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:06,209
Right.

555
00:40:22,226 --> 00:40:23,955
I brought you some dinner.

556
00:40:29,473 --> 00:40:30,480
Thank you.

557
00:40:57,532 --> 00:41:00,815
<i>You know what, I am damn lucky
that my cover wasn’t blown.

558
00:41:01,254 --> 00:41:03,138
<i>- Your cover's intact ?
- Yeah, we believe so.

559
00:41:03,206 --> 00:41:04,221
<i>Then let's move on.

560
00:41:04,247 --> 00:41:06,673
<i>But at this stage, I recommend
that we take down the cells

561
00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:08,867
<i>that we've already
infiltrated...

562
00:41:09,731 --> 00:41:12,338
<i>How many of the bombs
can you get ?

563
00:41:39,355 --> 00:41:41,755
How many of the bombs
can you get ?

564
