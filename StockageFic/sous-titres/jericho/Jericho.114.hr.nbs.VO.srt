00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:01,391
Previously on Jericho

2
00:00:01,739 --> 00:00:02,954
<i>Bring them inside.</i>

3
00:00:03,108 --> 00:00:04,439
<i>Some of them were on planes</i>

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,349
<i>that landed in
the middle of nowhere.</i>

5
00:00:06,562 --> 00:00:08,163
<i>They've been walking
for weeks.</i>

6
00:00:08,472 --> 00:00:10,179
<i>They must have gone
through hell.</i>

7
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,171
<i>Oh, my God... Roger.</i>

8
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:16,250
<i>You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.</i>

9
00:00:16,251 --> 00:00:17,910
<i>You need to keep
them clean and warm.</i>

10
00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:19,530
<i>Do you know anyone
in Jericho?</i>

11
00:00:19,704 --> 00:00:21,942
<i>Actually... I do.</i>

12
00:00:23,612 --> 00:00:24,711
<i>Hello, Rob.</i>

13
00:00:24,982 --> 00:00:27,239
<i>We're using the generator
to power the town hall</i>

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,583
<i>for three hours a day,
the Med Center for six.</i>

15
00:00:29,784 --> 00:00:33,142
<i>With 53 new people, at current
levels of consumption...</i>

16
00:00:33,563 --> 00:00:36,939
<i>we will be completely out
of gas and diesel in two weeks.</i>

17
00:00:37,131 --> 00:00:39,658
<i>- Mrs. Green?
- What?</i>

18
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:41,674
<i>Eric told me that
April's pregnant.</i>

19
00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:43,362
<i>It's the Old Man.</i>

20
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,964
<i>He's coming for us
using us against each other.</i>

21
00:00:46,022 --> 00:00:49,167
<i>We go see him and if,
if he is behind this,</i>

22
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:50,382
<i>We take him out.</i>

23
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,273
<i>We leave first thing
in the morning.</i>

24
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:19,363
<i>Any luck out there?</i>

25
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,791
Sorry, ma'am.

26
00:01:23,955 --> 00:01:26,154
Nothing?
Not even rabbits?

27
00:01:26,694 --> 00:01:28,313
Never seen anything
like it before.

28
00:01:28,314 --> 00:01:29,742
Nothing moving out there.

29
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,169
Think it was the fallout? Maybe it was
the radiation that killed the deer.

30
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:35,059
There'd still be dead animals,
carcasses, something.

31
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:35,904
I mean, it was weird.

32
00:01:35,905 --> 00:01:37,163
Like all the game had vanished.

33
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,463
How far out
did you go?

34
00:01:38,502 --> 00:01:42,168
15 miles out by Mill Pond
along the creek there.

35
00:01:42,288 --> 00:01:44,212
Guess we're going to have
to drive, huh, Jake?

36
00:01:44,213 --> 00:01:47,225
Yeah, but we have to be careful
about burning the gas rations

37
00:01:47,226 --> 00:01:48,228
in the middle of winter.

38
00:01:48,286 --> 00:01:50,214
We need everything we can
to run the generator.

39
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:51,777
We can live without
power for now.

40
00:01:52,318 --> 00:01:53,505
Make fires to stay warm.

41
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,926
But we won't see Spring
if we don't eat.

42
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:58,907
Stanley and I will have to use
whatever gas we can spare.

43
00:01:59,147 --> 00:02:01,104
and go out west,
Go out as far as it takes.

44
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:03,912
The rest of the hunting parties
will have to scrounge around locally.

45
00:02:03,913 --> 00:02:05,932
Yeah, and Mimi's coming
with us.

46
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:07,658
What?

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,903
Well, in case something happens to me,
I want to make sure she knows...

48
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:13,325
how to trap and shoot, okay?

49
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:19,090
Look, the further you get
the hairier the roads are.

50
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:20,614
With food being
as scarce as it is,

51
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:22,388
there's bound to be
some trouble out there.

52
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:24,704
That sleeping bag's
rated to 40 below

53
00:02:24,824 --> 00:02:27,867
and here's a wind-proof lighter for you.
You're going to need them both.

54
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,299
Good hunting.

55
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,199
I'm guessing the good folks
of Jericho don't know

56
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,151
about all this stuff down here.
- They don't know about a lot of things.

57
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:39,424
That'll be enough to get us
to the Old Man's place?

58
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,522
He is only about
two hours away.

59
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:43,524
I didn't realize
he was so close.

60
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,164
He chose the rally point.

61
00:02:45,636 --> 00:02:47,324
Wanted it in his backyard.

62
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:48,906
How long as he been
watching you?

63
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,269
My guess...

64
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,796
since I stopped communications
a few days ago.

65
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:57,309
You worried about what we're
going to find out there?

66
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,509
- You're not.
- We can handle him.

67
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:02,827
It's you and me.
Let's get to work.

68
00:03:07,414 --> 00:03:09,246
My grandmother
went fast than this

69
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:10,790
and she didn't
even have a car.

70
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:13,009
We have to take it easy,
we only have half a tank.

71
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,764
Well, hopefully we'll make it
to Flint Springs. It's got...

72
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:16,192
Hopefully? What do you
mean "hopefully"?

73
00:03:16,193 --> 00:03:18,292
It's got a river.
It's prime white-tailed terrain.

74
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:19,449
I know, but...
This is crazy.

75
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,417
I told you that
I can't hunt.

76
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:22,652
Now you want me to kill Bambi.

77
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:23,926
You're gonna have to
learn, all right?

78
00:03:23,927 --> 00:03:25,932
Everyone's doing their part.
Bonnie's been out twice.

79
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:27,215
Well, good for
frickin' Bonnie.

80
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:28,565
Bonnie grew up on farm.

81
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:30,301
The closest I ever got
to the outdoors

82
00:03:30,302 --> 00:03:32,463
was the is the Ralph Lauren
section of Neiman Marcus.

83
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:33,639
There you go,
bargain hunting.

84
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,854
Same thing, but with a gun.

85
00:03:34,855 --> 00:03:36,870
Bargains? At Neimans?

86
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:38,246
Sometimes I forget

87
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:40,426
that the biggest designer
in your closet is Wrangler.

88
00:03:42,104 --> 00:03:43,194
What are you
laughing at?

89
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,461
I've never seen you in a
domestic squabble before.

90
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:47,231
Knock it off.
This isn't squabbling.

91
00:03:51,726 --> 00:03:52,691
Oh, my God.

92
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:57,820
These dogs have tags.

93
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:04,434
Look at all this.

94
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:10,418
Wall Drugs.

95
00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:12,232
Wall, South Dakota.

96
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:14,752
Do you think that's where all
these people were coming from?

97
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:15,685
Think about it.

98
00:04:15,998 --> 00:04:18,545
South Dakota without heat,
electricity, or...

99
00:04:19,104 --> 00:04:20,416
food being trucked in.

100
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:22,365
It's got to be even worse
in North Dakota,

101
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:23,271
Montana.

102
00:04:27,032 --> 00:04:28,228
Oh, my God.

103
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:43,395
I read about this
at Blackjack.

104
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,940
Mass migration, hundreds...
maybe thousands of people

105
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:49,831
heading south.

106
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:53,496
Trying to outrun winter.

107
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:56,484
Should we be doing
that, too?

112
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:21,499
How far is it?

113
00:05:23,544 --> 00:05:24,567
...60.

114
00:05:25,184 --> 00:05:26,438
It's about 60 yards.

115
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:31,328
So 60 yard with almost
1.5 people per yard.

116
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:32,465
That's 90.

117
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,453
That's almost 100 people
just across.

118
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:35,751
The way the ground
is trampled,

119
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,680
you got to figure five
or tens times that amount

120
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:38,798
of people came through here.

121
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:41,925
Almost a thousand people?
Where are they going?

122
00:05:42,773 --> 00:05:44,606
South Texas, Mexico.

123
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,105
Anyplace warmer.

124
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,285
It'd take weeks
to get there by foot.

125
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:50,483
God know how many thousand
people have the same idea.

126
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,124
Mexico's borders
could be closed.

127
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,304
We don't even know if
there still is a Mexico.

128
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:56,911
Maybe we should try
to catch on with them.

129
00:05:56,912 --> 00:06:00,789
We can barely feed ourselves,
let alone... hundreds more.

130
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:04,298
We got to keep going.

131
00:06:06,806 --> 00:06:07,964
Let's go.

132
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,872
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

133
00:06:22,654 --> 00:06:23,860
Hey. Glad you came down.

134
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:25,471
Thank you.

135
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,880
- What time did you, uh...
- Early...

136
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:29,308
late, I guess.

137
00:06:29,374 --> 00:06:31,429
I didn't want to wake you,
you looked so peaceful.

138
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,089
Peaceful? Really?

139
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:35,877
Did you have another one of those
bad dreams? Keep on there.

140
00:06:36,058 --> 00:06:38,113
I guess neither one of
us got much sleep.

141
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:41,755
All I could do was think about
all these people down here, you know.

142
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:44,466
And then I remembered about the
clothes we had in the attic.

143
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:46,120
I thought that sweater
looked familiar.

144
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,101
Yeah, that woman was on
layover in Kansas City

145
00:06:48,102 --> 00:06:49,104
when the bombs went off,

146
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,790
Her husband and two kids
were waiting for her at home.

147
00:06:51,824 --> 00:06:52,634
Where?

148
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:53,599
Denver.

149
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:56,937
I lead these people here.

150
00:06:57,055 --> 00:06:58,984
For better or worse
this is their home now.

151
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:01,125
It's on me to make sure
they're taken care of.

152
00:07:01,936 --> 00:07:03,576
Yeah, of course.

153
00:07:04,463 --> 00:07:05,833
What can I do to help, huh?

154
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:09,551
Talk to them,
follow your instincts.

155
00:07:10,612 --> 00:07:11,789
The truth is...

156
00:07:11,885 --> 00:07:13,680
I'm winging this myself.

157
00:07:21,623 --> 00:07:22,761
I'll be outside.
Here.

158
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,497
Should be back
before dark.

159
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:33,044
And if you're not?

160
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:38,258
Just tell me when I
should start to worry.

161
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:39,956
This is the last time,

162
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:41,036
okay?

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,332
After today

164
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:44,952
I'm here...

165
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:48,270
for good, huh?

166
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:50,652
Okay.

167
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:52,832
I'll hold you to that.

168
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:04,923
Hi, honey.

169
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,765
How'd it go this morning?

170
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,261
The whole thing
was a bust.

171
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:09,553
I'm sorry, hon.

172
00:08:09,678 --> 00:08:10,643
Jake's out there now.

173
00:08:10,644 --> 00:08:11,801
Hopefully he and Stanley

174
00:08:11,802 --> 00:08:13,306
will have better luck
than I did.

175
00:08:13,585 --> 00:08:14,386
Is April here?

176
00:08:14,387 --> 00:08:15,437
No, she's at
the clinic.

177
00:08:15,438 --> 00:08:17,385
She promised me
she'd take a nap.

178
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:20,096
I hope it is warmer in that
clinic than it is in this house.

179
00:08:20,097 --> 00:08:22,102
I think this house has
dropped ten degrees

180
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:23,182
in the last hour.

181
00:08:24,012 --> 00:08:25,729
Feels like a storm's
coming in.

182
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:29,886
We'd better seal up these
windows the best was we can.

183
00:08:30,022 --> 00:08:32,144
Been going around collecting
old sheets and linens.

184
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:34,421
We'll shove them
underneath the doors.

185
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,003
Look what I found...

186
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,029
hidden in Jake's closet.

187
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:42,109
Lord knows how long
that's been there.

188
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:44,308
Well, at least he was
drinking the good stuff.

189
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:47,125
I used to hide the most awful
rotgut in the world

190
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,784
behind my mother's
china cabinet.

191
00:08:53,989 --> 00:08:55,011
What do you think?

192
00:08:56,497 --> 00:08:57,867
On an empty stomach?

193
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,873
I'll get the glasses.

194
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:04,896
Why would anyone destroy all this.

195
00:10:04,907 --> 00:10:07,991
If they'd wanted it out of commission,
they could have just taken it.

196
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:09,966
Be worth a fortune after the E.M.P.

197
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:12,229
Maybe there wasn't time,

198
00:10:12,293 --> 00:10:14,876
or maybe they didn't
care about this stuff.

199
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:24,198
- How long?
- A couple of days...

200
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:25,350
Give or take.

201
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:27,856
But we just heard
from him yesterday.

202
00:10:29,618 --> 00:10:31,190
We heard from someone.

203
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,624
Remote uplink.

204
00:10:32,994 --> 00:10:35,190
Somebody else using
his access codes.

205
00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:36,924
Who could have done this?

206
00:10:44,987 --> 00:10:46,658
Wager for the first kill.

207
00:10:47,224 --> 00:10:48,807
I'm in for a dozen eggs.

208
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,645
Two hours chopping wood.

209
00:10:51,992 --> 00:10:53,634
Tax return consultation.

210
00:10:55,486 --> 00:10:57,769
Oh, how about
foot massages for a week?

211
00:10:58,162 --> 00:10:59,665
For me, not for him.

212
00:11:00,642 --> 00:11:01,660
We'll talk.

213
00:11:01,683 --> 00:11:02,914
Stanley, stop.

214
00:11:08,724 --> 00:11:11,406
- What are they doing?
- They're blocking the whole road.

215
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:13,221
More like staking it out.

216
00:11:14,463 --> 00:11:15,943
All right, turn around.

217
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:17,308
And... and go where?

218
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:21,163
I don't know. Just do it, all right?
Turn around. We'll find another road.

219
00:11:40,582 --> 00:11:42,351
I see it. Damn it.

220
00:11:46,817 --> 00:11:48,678
Why are they following us?

221
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,606
Stanley, gun it!

222
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,608
This should get us
back to the highway.

223
00:12:03,609 --> 00:12:04,476
Then what?

224
00:12:04,477 --> 00:12:06,734
We try to make it back home,
find the patrol.

225
00:12:07,062 --> 00:12:08,942
Maybe they'll give up by then
or run out of gas.

226
00:12:08,953 --> 00:12:10,624
Yeah, if we don't first.

227
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,929
Stanley...
Stanley, hold on!

228
00:12:14,756 --> 00:12:16,740
Doesn't look like
he put up much of a fight.

229
00:12:16,741 --> 00:12:18,492
He was probably out
before he knew what hit him.

230
00:12:18,493 --> 00:12:20,743
He must have trusted whoever did it.

231
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:24,338
The thing is, whoever it was,

232
00:12:25,147 --> 00:12:27,309
they knew what
they were doing there,

233
00:12:27,578 --> 00:12:28,850
not over here.

234
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:31,347
I mean, look at this.
It's a mess.

235
00:12:31,348 --> 00:12:34,118
But the drives...
They look like they're still intact.

236
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:37,359
The old man had information
on the entire team...

237
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,368
Contact information,
backgrounds...

238
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:40,884
Last known whereabouts.

239
00:12:42,355 --> 00:12:44,436
Let's find out where everybody is.

240
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,347
We can't outrun them.

241
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:50,334
- How far till Jericho?
- Too far.

242
00:12:52,349 --> 00:12:53,360
Oh, God!

243
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,423
Stay down.

244
00:13:10,677 --> 00:13:11,821
Stay down.

245
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:32,634
Give me that drive you got there.

246
00:13:33,453 --> 00:13:35,310
Must feel good to be back
in the saddle, huh?

247
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:38,458
I wish we didn't have
to come out here in the first place.

248
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,388
What, are you getting soft on me?
Too much domestic bliss?

249
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:42,985
Not quite bliss.

250
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,859
There.
There it is. We're in.

251
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,591
Thank you.

252
00:14:14,007 --> 00:14:15,798
Karaoke bullfighter, right?

253
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,855
Excuse me?

254
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,370
At that bar in Barcelona.

255
00:14:18,393 --> 00:14:21,902
You decked a bullfighter who tried
to get you to stop singing that song...

256
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:23,439
"Stairway to Heaven"?

257
00:14:23,983 --> 00:14:25,543
Did Roger tell you that?

258
00:14:26,144 --> 00:14:29,385
He also mentioned you like Oreo,
ice cream and white daisies.

259
00:14:30,818 --> 00:14:32,286
Don't be mad at him.

260
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:34,875
He was trying to keep us entertained.

261
00:14:34,876 --> 00:14:36,297
He kept talking and,

262
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:37,915
somehow, we kept moving.

263
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:51,569
Hey. How you doing?

264
00:14:51,604 --> 00:14:52,937
I'm a little tired.

265
00:14:52,938 --> 00:14:55,424
I'm going to head home
and get cleaned up.

266
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,021
Think I'll stay here for a
little longer if you don't mind.

267
00:14:59,437 --> 00:15:00,760
Yeah. Of course.

268
00:15:00,957 --> 00:15:01,983
You sure?

269
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,841
Yeah, I'm sure.

270
00:15:03,876 --> 00:15:06,280
Looks like you owe
these folks a rematch.

271
00:15:06,997 --> 00:15:09,340
So, um...
I will see you when I see you.

272
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:27,171
- To Jake.
- To Jake.

273
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:30,986
Who would have thought,
six months ago, you'd be toasting him?

274
00:15:33,518 --> 00:15:36,428
Well, God knows Eric wouldn't
have hidden the bottle.

275
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,922
You and Jake have always
had much more in common

276
00:15:39,923 --> 00:15:41,667
than you wanted to admit.

277
00:15:43,678 --> 00:15:44,967
You going hunting

278
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:47,603
all those weekends...

279
00:15:49,894 --> 00:15:53,050
Why that kid got sit
in a deer stand for hours?

280
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:57,316
We wouldn't say a word
to each other. Just...

281
00:15:58,322 --> 00:16:00,010
be in the woods together.

282
00:16:02,915 --> 00:16:06,777
I was always afraid that Jake
would forget about that.

283
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,118
You know, that he'd grow up only
remembering the bad times. That we were

284
00:16:12,161 --> 00:16:15,287
That he wouldn't remember
that we had been close.

285
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:19,686
That we were... buddies once.

286
00:16:24,364 --> 00:16:25,601
He remembers...

287
00:16:29,994 --> 00:16:31,254
deep down.

288
00:16:33,747 --> 00:16:36,464
That's why you mean
so much to him.

289
00:16:39,493 --> 00:16:41,331
Boy, that wind sounds awful.

290
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,655
I hope Stanley and Jake
are okay out there.

291
00:17:40,408 --> 00:17:41,469
What happened?

292
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,744
Jake, Stanley's not moving.

293
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:45,750
- What?
- Stanley's not moving.

294
00:17:54,078 --> 00:17:55,487
Oh, my God. Go hide.

295
00:17:57,188 --> 00:17:58,372
- Go hide.
- No

296
00:17:58,657 --> 00:17:59,868
- Go on.
- No, No. Stanley...

297
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:01,744
You'll be fine.
Go! Go hide!

298
00:19:19,383 --> 00:19:21,330
Come on.
Help me with Stanley.

299
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:24,244
I can't move.

300
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:29,986
Ritts, Woodworth, Pierce.

301
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:31,963
That's half the team.

302
00:19:32,402 --> 00:19:34,680
We're being hunted.
It's worse than that.

303
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,264
It's Woodworth and his wife.

304
00:19:37,622 --> 00:19:39,787
They were in Richmond.
That's his daughter.

305
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,373
Anyone close to us
is in danger, too.

306
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:43,911
No loose ends.

307
00:19:44,655 --> 00:19:45,889
Don't worry about your family.

308
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:48,007
We're not going to let
anything happen to them.

309
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:49,831
It's just us, Chavez
and Cheung left.

310
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,147
We'll get back out on the field,
stay in the weeds

311
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:53,844
until we can connect
with the chief.

312
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:55,273
Here. Look at this.

313
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:01,181
What is that?

314
00:20:01,528 --> 00:20:03,400
If we are being hunted,

315
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,872
there... is the hunter.

316
00:20:14,135 --> 00:20:16,856
Stanley, are you okay?

317
00:20:18,013 --> 00:20:19,132
Can you get up?

318
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:28,849
Your leg?

319
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:31,203
I think I busted my ankle.

320
00:20:39,043 --> 00:20:40,190
I'm okay.

321
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:42,226
I'm just stuck.

322
00:20:44,145 --> 00:20:46,084
- Let me try to get this off.
- Stanley, don't.

323
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:48,863
We can't do this ourselves.
You might make it worse.

324
00:20:50,577 --> 00:20:52,256
Maybe you could dig me out.

325
00:20:52,854 --> 00:20:54,069
All right.

326
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,137
Help me get the shovels. They're in
the bed of the truck.

327
00:20:57,581 --> 00:20:58,912
It's gone.

328
00:20:58,931 --> 00:21:00,909
All right, get the jack.
The jack's back there.

329
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,177
They took everything.

330
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:13,093
How was your bath?

331
00:21:15,717 --> 00:21:18,148
Lukewarm, then luke-cold,

332
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:19,564
then pretty much icy.

333
00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:22,728
- Look. Remember this?
- Oh, yeah.

334
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:25,198
Times Square,
New Year's Eve, 2005.

335
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:26,606
Wasted.

336
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,555
That hangover was epic.

337
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:35,749
Do you remember the last thing I said to
you the night before you left Jericho ?

338
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,997
That I was selfish
and I didn't listen?

339
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:39,019
Something like that?

340
00:21:40,022 --> 00:21:42,877
You have no idea how that ate
at me while you were gone.

341
00:21:43,128 --> 00:21:46,119
- I just kept thinking that was
the last  - You were right.

342
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:54,963
You know, today,
seeing you with those people...

343
00:21:56,255 --> 00:21:57,992
It was like you had found yourself.

344
00:21:59,863 --> 00:22:02,216
I'm still just trying to figure
it out, you know?

345
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:05,881
We're not these people anymore.

346
00:22:12,454 --> 00:22:14,643
But I'll tell you the one thing
that hasn't changed.

347
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,332
The one constant.

348
00:22:16,891 --> 00:22:17,856
I love you.

349
00:22:18,822 --> 00:22:20,443
And it's going
to take a whole lot more

350
00:22:20,444 --> 00:22:22,488
than the end of the world
to change that.

351
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,287
- How are your legs?
- I don't know I can't feel anything.

352
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:38,235
The ground's
frozen solid.

353
00:22:38,236 --> 00:22:39,507
It's sucking the heat
right out of you.

354
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:40,801
Why can't we build a fire?

355
00:22:40,878 --> 00:22:42,228
You smell the fumes?

356
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,158
You have to get back to town.

357
00:22:44,293 --> 00:22:45,739
All right. I'm going
to try and go.

358
00:22:46,746 --> 00:22:48,444
No. You can't on that ankle.

359
00:22:48,816 --> 00:22:50,798
- I'll go.
- No. Those guys are still out there.

360
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,052
They went the other way.

361
00:22:52,148 --> 00:22:54,830
Jericho has a patrol
five miles out of town.

362
00:22:54,926 --> 00:22:56,412
We can't have come
more than ten.

363
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,975
Jake, it's too dangerous.

364
00:22:58,025 --> 00:22:59,067
What are our options?

365
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,456
With no bags, no fire?

366
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:02,926
All right, one of you goes
or we all die here.

367
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:08,983
All right, fine, fine.

368
00:23:10,168 --> 00:23:13,277
I threw a flashlight over there
somewhere. You might need it.

369
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,863
Listen...

370
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:20,355
stay on the shoulder
the whole time, okay?

371
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:23,183
If you see any headlights
or you hear any engines,

372
00:23:24,456 --> 00:23:25,865
get low and hide,

373
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:27,755
all right?
Now, you're gonna
want to head

374
00:23:28,272 --> 00:23:29,265
southeast.

375
00:23:30,403 --> 00:23:32,757
Stanley, that doesn't mean
anything to me.

376
00:23:35,612 --> 00:23:36,963
Stay on this road.

377
00:23:37,078 --> 00:23:38,699
Stay on this road
and then you make...

378
00:23:38,756 --> 00:23:40,223
make your first left

379
00:23:40,473 --> 00:23:42,287
Okay?
And you're gonna go about a mile

380
00:23:42,384 --> 00:23:44,246
and then you're gonna make
your second right,

381
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:47,631
and you're gonna make another right
and then another left.

382
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:50,765
And then once you get to the crossroads
of the highway, you're home free...

383
00:23:51,258 --> 00:23:53,862
You'll see a big sign pointing
to the way to Jericho, okay?

384
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:55,116
Got it?

385
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,470
Left, second right.

386
00:23:57,904 --> 00:23:59,235
Right, left,

387
00:23:59,274 --> 00:24:00,074
Right.

388
00:24:04,803 --> 00:24:06,211
Mimi, I...

389
00:24:06,442 --> 00:24:07,504
Don't worry.

390
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,163
Don't worry.

391
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:10,532
I'll be careful.

392
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,514
<i>Here's what we're gonna do:</i>

393
00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:28,327
I know a place that's safe.

394
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:30,951
We take Darcy and the kids
out of Jericho

395
00:24:31,047 --> 00:24:33,651
and stash them before you and I
get back on the move.

396
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,629
I am not leaving them alone.

397
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,365
- I don't think you have a choice.
- No...

398
00:24:37,366 --> 00:24:39,603
See, because I've got leverage.

399
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:42,998
If they kill me, they will
never find the package.

400
00:24:43,383 --> 00:24:45,139
It's not you
they're gonna kill.

401
00:24:45,544 --> 00:24:48,264
It'll be Sam
or Darcy or me;

402
00:24:49,441 --> 00:24:51,949
anything they can use
to get to you.

403
00:24:56,523 --> 00:24:58,915
Anything they can
use to get to me.

404
00:25:03,206 --> 00:25:04,383
The body.

405
00:25:05,222 --> 00:25:07,691
These... These, uh...

406
00:25:08,777 --> 00:25:12,346
...these half-smashed drives,

407
00:25:13,272 --> 00:25:15,240
<i>...this whole...</i>

408
00:25:15,626 --> 00:25:16,976
this whole setup--

409
00:25:17,497 --> 00:25:19,233
If someone had wanted
to destroy all this,

410
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:20,844
why leave the house
standing, huh?

411
00:25:21,056 --> 00:25:23,082
Why not just burn it all down?

412
00:25:23,747 --> 00:25:25,600
Someone wanted us
to see all this.

413
00:25:34,496 --> 00:25:35,769
We're being played.

414
00:25:36,406 --> 00:25:38,248
Why would anyone go through
all that trouble?

415
00:25:38,498 --> 00:25:39,521
I don't know,

416
00:25:39,984 --> 00:25:41,257
but this is all too big now.

417
00:25:41,258 --> 00:25:42,713
There's too many angles
to cover.

418
00:25:42,714 --> 00:25:43,948
Too many unknowns.

419
00:25:45,723 --> 00:25:46,822
I need to get home.

420
00:25:46,823 --> 00:25:48,115
- Robert, wait.
- What?

421
00:25:50,469 --> 00:25:51,626
Let's think about this.

422
00:25:51,627 --> 00:25:53,459
What's the plan?
What are you going to do?

423
00:25:53,704 --> 00:25:57,215
You know, maybe the plan all
along was to get us out here.

424
00:25:58,141 --> 00:25:59,742
I gotta protect
my family, Sarah.

425
00:26:00,784 --> 00:26:02,115
And what about the package?

426
00:26:05,376 --> 00:26:06,909
It'll need to be moved.

427
00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:24,081
This isn't so bad, right?

428
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,653
Hey, we've been
through worse.

429
00:26:25,696 --> 00:26:27,427
Remember the time we got stuck on
the roof of the...

430
00:26:27,428 --> 00:26:29,494
town hall in the middle
of a lightning storm, huh?

431
00:26:29,861 --> 00:26:31,790
We were so afraid the lightning
was going to...

432
00:26:32,156 --> 00:26:33,545
blow up the fireworks.

433
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,383
You squealed like a little girl
wanting to jump off that roof.

434
00:26:37,384 --> 00:26:38,271
That was you.

435
00:26:38,618 --> 00:26:40,161
Your voice hadn't changed yet.

436
00:26:40,817 --> 00:26:43,422
Please, I had you beat by,
like, six months.

437
00:26:46,173 --> 00:26:47,427
Drink some water.

438
00:26:48,662 --> 00:26:49,704
It's frozen right through.

439
00:26:50,128 --> 00:26:51,074
What?

440
00:26:57,064 --> 00:27:00,131
I saw an abandoned cabin about
a quarter mile up the road.

441
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,347
You need to get inside.

442
00:27:02,813 --> 00:27:04,511
It'll hurt, but you can make it.

443
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,247
- Jake, I'm staying.
- Listen to me!

444
00:27:06,946 --> 00:27:10,265
There's no point in both of us
freezing to death out there.

445
00:27:10,843 --> 00:27:12,869
- She's coming back.
- When?

446
00:27:14,201 --> 00:27:15,648
She's been gone for, like,
an hour.

447
00:27:15,649 --> 00:27:17,606
It'll take her a little while to
reach the patrol,

448
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:19,265
but when she does,
she'll find someone.

449
00:27:19,266 --> 00:27:20,442
I know she'll find someone.

450
00:27:21,214 --> 00:27:22,931
Unless somebody finds her first.

451
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,435
Look,

452
00:27:24,471 --> 00:27:26,825
it's gonna get dark soon,
you need to go.

453
00:27:35,356 --> 00:27:37,787
You wouldn't leave me
any more than I'm leaving you.

454
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:43,131
Mimi's strong.
She'll find her way.

455
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:56,888
Wait...

456
00:27:56,889 --> 00:27:58,643
he said keep going east.

457
00:28:00,071 --> 00:28:01,672
No... southeast.

458
00:28:03,355 --> 00:28:06,750
And... look for a sign.

459
00:28:19,814 --> 00:28:21,743
Oh, God, I hate this place!

460
00:28:50,949 --> 00:28:52,068
Come on, man.

461
00:28:52,671 --> 00:28:53,732
You can't fall asleep.

462
00:28:53,828 --> 00:28:55,159
You got to stay up;
come on.

463
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:56,485
You stopped shivering.
Come on.

464
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:58,467
You got to talk to me--
come on, come on, buddy.

465
00:28:58,468 --> 00:28:59,770
You gotta talk to me.

466
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:01,236
Talk to me, buddy.
Come on.

467
00:29:01,584 --> 00:29:02,781
I'm sorry.

468
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:03,996
I'm really sorry.

469
00:29:03,997 --> 00:29:05,251
About what?

470
00:29:05,982 --> 00:29:07,487
Five years ago.

471
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,512
Sorry I left the way I did.

472
00:29:10,091 --> 00:29:11,634
Iit's okay. It doesn't matter.

473
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:12,850
Doesn't matter.

474
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,227
I was gonna call.

475
00:29:16,639 --> 00:29:17,699
I was gonna call.

476
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,410
I know. Listen, I want you
to forget about it, okay?

477
00:29:20,411 --> 00:29:22,732
We never got to go backpacking
in Costa Rica.

478
00:29:22,733 --> 00:29:23,533
You know what?

479
00:29:24,072 --> 00:29:26,088
We're still gonna get to go
backpacking in Costa Rica, okay?

480
00:29:26,089 --> 00:29:27,398
We're gonna...

481
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:28,807
we're gonna learn how to surf.

482
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,485
We're gonna sleep
on the beach.

483
00:29:30,716 --> 00:29:32,644
As soon as the planes
are up and running again,

484
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:33,891
it's gonna be you and me.

485
00:29:34,026 --> 00:29:36,379
Hell, you can fly us
there yourself, huh?

486
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,012
Come on. Come on.
Tell me something good, man.

487
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:42,076
I haven't talked to you in five years.
You've been gone for five years.

488
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:45,351
Tell me... Hey, tell me
about San Diego.

489
00:29:45,352 --> 00:29:46,456
How was it?

490
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,214
- Warm.
- Warm, right.

491
00:29:49,851 --> 00:29:51,665
Beaches, blondes, huh?

492
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,434
What were you doing there?

493
00:29:54,512 --> 00:29:56,614
Flying, flying planes.

494
00:29:56,692 --> 00:29:59,373
Really?
That's cool, man.

495
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,939
Your grandfather
would've been psyched, huh?

496
00:30:02,048 --> 00:30:04,536
Did you have a girl there?
I know you had a girl.

497
00:30:04,884 --> 00:30:06,292
She's dead.

498
00:30:12,026 --> 00:30:13,261
What do you mean?

499
00:30:14,052 --> 00:30:15,537
You don't know that.

500
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:18,421
I mean, it all depends on where she was
when the bombs went off, right?

501
00:30:18,422 --> 00:30:20,007
I mean, she could
have made it, right?

502
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,907
- Tell me what her name was.
- She's dead....

503
00:30:21,908 --> 00:30:23,161
It was my fault.

504
00:30:23,162 --> 00:30:24,828
- It's not your fault.
- Let me lay down.

505
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:26,083
- Jake, no.
- Let me lay down.

506
00:30:26,084 --> 00:30:27,955
It wasn't your fault.
Come on... Come on...

507
00:30:28,205 --> 00:30:30,106
Come on, stay with me.
You gotta stay with me.

508
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,617
Come on, Jake.

509
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:35,858
Stay with me, Jake.
Come on, man.

510
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,063
Stay with me.

511
00:30:59,172 --> 00:31:00,329
Come on!

512
00:31:07,371 --> 00:31:09,686
Okay, gotta keep moving.

513
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,306
Gotta keep moving.

514
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,239
Please don't hurt me...
please don't hurt me.

515
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:40,802
Please don't hurt me!

516
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,519
Please don't hurt me...

517
00:31:42,866 --> 00:31:43,893
Mimi?

518
00:31:47,129 --> 00:31:50,061
- It's Gail and Johnston Green, honey.
You're safe.  - Oh, thanks God!

519
00:31:50,264 --> 00:31:51,972
Come on, baby,
let's get out of here.

520
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,342
Come on.

521
00:32:01,521 --> 00:32:02,872
Those are hideous.

522
00:32:02,873 --> 00:32:04,878
Are those the sheets
from your old apartment?

523
00:32:05,225 --> 00:32:07,541
Because you can't expect
anyone to sleep on those.

524
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:10,970
If anyone asks, we'll pretend
someone else donated them.

525
00:32:20,211 --> 00:32:21,233
Your dress.

526
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:25,439
Guess I shouldn't be seeing this, huh?

527
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:29,027
The day's sort of come and gone, so...

528
00:32:30,955 --> 00:32:32,055
It'll come again.

529
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:33,772
You think?

530
00:32:35,548 --> 00:32:36,667
I do.

531
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:40,159
I tell you what, I've got
a pack of Ramen noodles

532
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,760
with your name on it,
what do you say?

533
00:32:42,184 --> 00:32:45,078
Great. I'll deliver this to the shelter
and come back and wash up.

534
00:32:45,637 --> 00:32:47,046
Roger, wait.

535
00:32:48,723 --> 00:32:50,093
I'll come with you.

536
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:08,325
It's Mom and Dad, honey!

537
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:10,813
Stanley, you all right, sweetheart?

538
00:33:11,738 --> 00:33:13,841
You need to go get in the truck
and get warm, pal.

539
00:33:13,842 --> 00:33:15,520
- Where's Mimi?
- I'm right here.

540
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:16,891
Stanley, I'm right here.

541
00:33:19,572 --> 00:33:21,482
Wake up. Wake up!

542
00:33:22,331 --> 00:33:23,527
Wake up, Jake.

543
00:33:23,932 --> 00:33:24,935
Wake up.

544
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,340
Wake up. Oh, thank God.

545
00:33:26,341 --> 00:33:27,690
We're gonna help you, honey.

546
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:31,240
We saw the storm coming

547
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:33,710
and we started to worry
when you hadn't come back.

548
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:34,809
Sweetheart...

549
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:38,398
Honey,

550
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,616
we're not gonna be able
to get this truck off of him.

551
00:33:40,617 --> 00:33:42,506
I need you to take
these guys back to town

552
00:33:42,507 --> 00:33:44,015
and get me some help out here.

553
00:33:44,016 --> 00:33:46,673
You signal when you're coming back
so I know it's you, all right?

554
00:33:46,674 --> 00:33:49,084
- I'll flash the lights.
- All right, go, go, go!

555
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:52,690
Jake, look at me, son.

556
00:33:52,691 --> 00:33:53,693
Lookie here.

557
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:56,220
You're gonna make it, son...
I know you.

558
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:59,905
I know what you're made of.
You're gonna be all right.

559
00:34:00,445 --> 00:34:03,049
You're gonna make it.
Stay with me now.

560
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:19,194
Robert, please,
the kids are sleeping.

561
00:34:19,753 --> 00:34:22,319
- I'm sorry.
- What on earth are you doing?

562
00:34:22,662 --> 00:34:24,186
Oh, I'm sorry.

563
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,811
Jake, you'll be home real soon,

564
00:34:39,217 --> 00:34:41,300
but you got to stay
with me now. Come on.

565
00:34:43,663 --> 00:34:45,506
Leave me here.
Leave me alone.

566
00:34:45,776 --> 00:34:47,435
Now, I'm not going anywhere.

567
00:34:47,995 --> 00:34:49,557
But you got to hang on.

568
00:34:49,866 --> 00:34:51,757
Now, they'll be here soon, son.

569
00:34:53,802 --> 00:34:54,814
Dad...

570
00:34:55,431 --> 00:34:56,676
I'm sorry.

571
00:34:57,521 --> 00:34:59,643
Oh, son, you got nothing
to be sorry about.

572
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:06,415
Open your eyes, Jake.
Come on, now.

573
00:35:07,264 --> 00:35:09,406
Look at me.
Look at me, Jake.

574
00:35:11,682 --> 00:35:13,168
I can see her.

575
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,351
See who?

576
00:35:17,952 --> 00:35:19,322
The girl.

577
00:35:21,617 --> 00:35:23,257
What... girl?

578
00:35:23,258 --> 00:35:24,994
Jake, I think you're hallucinating, son.

579
00:35:24,995 --> 00:35:26,017
No, listen to me.

580
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,126
When I was in Iraq...

581
00:35:32,538 --> 00:35:34,139
... there was a girl.

582
00:35:36,474 --> 00:35:38,191
She couldn't have been more than...

583
00:35:38,882 --> 00:35:40,039
10 or 12...

584
00:35:40,946 --> 00:35:42,297
Don't talk now, son.

585
00:35:42,489 --> 00:35:43,512
You save your energy.

586
00:35:43,513 --> 00:35:45,133
We'll talk when we get... home.

587
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:47,949
I killed her, Dad.

588
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:55,531
I killed a little girl.

589
00:36:15,576 --> 00:36:16,907
Hurry up!

590
00:36:29,948 --> 00:36:31,434
Open your eyes, Jake.

591
00:36:31,435 --> 00:36:32,804
Open your eyes.

592
00:36:34,096 --> 00:36:35,870
All right, everyone on three...

593
00:36:35,871 --> 00:36:36,874
One,

594
00:36:37,202 --> 00:36:38,687
two, three!

595
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,130
All right, he's free.

596
00:36:45,632 --> 00:36:46,924
Let's get the board in here.

597
00:36:47,928 --> 00:36:49,761
One, two, three.

598
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,703
You were right.

599
00:37:01,704 --> 00:37:04,635
I need to get my family
as far away from me as possible.

600
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:07,046
I've been thinking, and...

601
00:37:07,837 --> 00:37:09,497
There's no other choice.

602
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,757
You're doing the right thing.

603
00:37:14,204 --> 00:37:15,284
Listen.

604
00:37:17,214 --> 00:37:18,603
After they're safe,

605
00:37:19,124 --> 00:37:20,976
you and me need
to get back in the field.

606
00:37:21,477 --> 00:37:23,406
That's half our team gone, Sarah,

607
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,621
and whoever did that
did it for a reason.

608
00:37:28,611 --> 00:37:30,290
How are you gonna tell Darcy?

609
00:37:33,356 --> 00:37:35,151
I'll tell her after I've moved them.

610
00:37:36,385 --> 00:37:39,048
She'll never agree if she knows
I won't be staying with them.

611
00:37:49,775 --> 00:37:51,704
He's better off here
than the med center.

612
00:37:51,955 --> 00:37:55,080
We're still on emergency power,
and it's... it's warmer here.

613
00:37:56,643 --> 00:37:57,974
Here, honey.

614
00:37:58,611 --> 00:37:59,861
What about his injuries?

615
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:01,775
Well, the cut on his head
isn't very deep,

616
00:38:01,776 --> 00:38:03,912
and neither one
of his legs are broken.

617
00:38:04,645 --> 00:38:05,860
He's very lucky.

618
00:38:05,861 --> 00:38:07,172
I'm freezing.

619
00:38:07,597 --> 00:38:09,410
I'm gonna go get you
some more blankets.

620
00:38:09,892 --> 00:38:11,416
You're still hypothermic.

621
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:14,426
It's just gonna take a few hours
for your body to stabilize.

622
00:38:16,123 --> 00:38:18,265
- Can we have a minute?
- Oh, sure.

623
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:34,992
Dad...

624
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:41,185
What I told you out there...

625
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,661
please forget it.

626
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,516
Please.

627
00:38:52,278 --> 00:38:53,706
Afraid I can't do that.

628
00:39:06,069 --> 00:39:08,423
I've seen a lot of things
in my time, Jake.

629
00:39:10,777 --> 00:39:11,992
I've been to war.

630
00:39:13,304 --> 00:39:16,680
I know what war can do.
I know what men can do... Terrible...

631
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,575
... terrible things.

632
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:23,833
I know what I did.

633
00:39:26,495 --> 00:39:28,000
You can talk to me.

634
00:39:53,466 --> 00:39:54,874
When you're ready, son.

635
00:39:58,213 --> 00:39:59,428
When you're ready.

636
00:40:17,467 --> 00:40:18,836
You okay?

637
00:40:27,132 --> 00:40:28,405
How's the sprain?

638
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:32,978
I think it'd be better with painkillers,
but I'm not gonna complain.

639
00:40:33,884 --> 00:40:37,006
You know, for a while there, I didn't
think I'd ever feel anything again.

640
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,404
When I was out there,

641
00:40:41,925 --> 00:40:43,257
just for a moment,

642
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:46,093
I didn't think
I was gonna make it.

643
00:40:47,136 --> 00:40:49,799
And I stopped... to rest.

644
00:40:50,686 --> 00:40:53,175
And then I just didn't
even want to move.

645
00:40:56,763 --> 00:40:57,940
But you did.

646
00:40:59,445 --> 00:41:00,757
You did make it.

647
00:41:02,223 --> 00:41:03,786
And I knew you would.

648
00:41:10,441 --> 00:41:12,313
Your lips are still cold.

649
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:16,460
Maybe you can warm them.

650
00:41:21,052 --> 00:41:23,309
That's the worst line
I've ever heard.

651
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,740
I know. I've got others.

652
00:41:26,975 --> 00:41:28,576
- Shut up.
- Okay.

653
00:41:39,405 --> 00:41:40,738
Tomorrow morning...

654
00:41:42,899 --> 00:41:43,973
we're leaving.

655
00:41:45,282 --> 00:41:47,110
We're leaving?
For... for where?

656
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,258
I don't know yet.

657
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,492
You don't know?

658
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,444
Darcy, when I came
to get you in DC...

659
00:42:01,556 --> 00:42:03,223
I told you it wasn't safe,

660
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,446
but I couldn't tell you why.

661
00:42:10,978 --> 00:42:12,176
I'm going for a walk.

662
00:42:25,529 --> 00:42:27,336
I have something
in my possession.

663
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,366
And there's people
out there that want it,

664
00:42:31,921 --> 00:42:34,094
that will stop at nothing to get it.

665
00:42:36,411 --> 00:42:38,011
And that puts you,
me and the kids

666
00:42:38,406 --> 00:42:39,532
in danger here.

667
00:42:45,686 --> 00:42:47,790
Okay, so th... then we go.

668
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:50,338
<i>I trust you.</i>

669
00:42:56,047 --> 00:42:57,212
<i>Robert, do y...</i>

670
00:42:58,665 --> 00:42:59,732
Do you trust me?

671
00:43:02,725 --> 00:43:05,008
- You're late.
- You're impatient.

672
00:43:10,301 --> 00:43:11,792
Then listen to me.

673
00:43:12,671 --> 00:43:14,835
Okay, Sarah is not on our side.

674
00:43:15,299 --> 00:43:16,721
Now... whatever's...

675
00:43:17,224 --> 00:43:18,548
gone on between the two of you,

676
00:43:18,549 --> 00:43:20,869
I'm telling you, Robert,
she's not here to help us.

677
00:43:24,395 --> 00:43:25,877
Have you located the package?

678
00:43:26,588 --> 00:43:27,593
Soon.

679
00:43:29,036 --> 00:43:30,973
Hawkins is starting to put
the pieces together.

680
00:43:30,974 --> 00:43:33,502
- He needs to be eliminated.
- I know.

681
00:43:33,718 --> 00:43:36,623
We've already eliminated the other
three targets without incident.

682
00:43:36,624 --> 00:43:38,303
Why are you stalling on this one?

683
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:51,064
Because this one is different.
