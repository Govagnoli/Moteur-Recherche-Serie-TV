Hello, Rob.

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,750
Someone on my team
sold us all out.

4
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:08,972
You’re smart enough to know that they
would say anything to get you to talk.

5
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:12,508
Get the package.

6
00:00:22,598 --> 00:00:24,527
In the last three months,
I remembered

7
00:00:24,548 --> 00:00:25,738
all the reasons...

8
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:27,783
why I needed you in my life.

9
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:28,934
So have I.

10
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:31,376
I've also remembered
why it can never work.

11
00:00:31,576 --> 00:00:33,876
I told Darcy she and the kids
can come stay with us.

12
00:00:33,892 --> 00:00:35,790
Thanks, Jimmy.
I appreciate that.

13
00:00:37,687 --> 00:00:39,056
<i>We have also received reports

14
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:41,922
<i>that the bombers gained
the trust of local officials

15
00:00:41,923 --> 00:00:45,092
<i>which allowed the terrorists
access to secure locations.

16
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:47,405
I’ve heard that voice before.

17
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,019
- That's the guy that does the
farm report.  - It’s real news.

18
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:52,753
<i>In New York, the terrorists
who were apprehended,

19
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:55,747
<i>were all carrying nearly perfect
fake FBI badges.

20
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,435
<i>- You're drunk.
- Yes, I am, Darcy.

21
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,990
<i>Yes, I am.

22
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:24,607
<i>What ?

23
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:41,198
What is it, Rob ?

24
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,155
Is all that really
worth it for 6 kids ?

25
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:13,364
Six kids in a conference room
is not Harvard, but it's a start.

26
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:14,989
I meant for you.

27
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:18,364
I think it's time we start trying
to get things back to normal.

28
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:20,259
To be honest with you,
if I'm a kid...

29
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:23,709
going to school isn't exactly high
on my list of priorities these days.

30
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:25,667
Hey, Jimmy.

31
00:03:26,842 --> 00:03:29,322
Hey, can I... borrow you for a few
minutes, I need your help.

32
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:31,472
I'm going to get you
a bat signal or something.

33
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,839
What's wrong ?

34
00:03:35,872 --> 00:03:38,588
You remember, last week on the
radio broadcast, they said that

35
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:41,521
terrorists used fake FBI badges
to move through security ?

36
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:44,171
I've seen one of those badges.

37
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,356
Where ?

38
00:03:48,656 --> 00:03:51,485
I never went to Law school,
but I'm going to go ahead and guess.

39
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:54,017
- This is breaking and entering.
- It's called probable cause.

40
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:56,051
It's called paranoïd
abuse of authority.

41
00:03:56,435 --> 00:03:58,952
Come on, let's go... before he
comes home and catches you...

42
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:00,535
prying up his floorboards.

43
00:04:00,868 --> 00:04:02,535
The terrorists had FBI badges...

44
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:04,817
Robert Hawkins has an FBI badge.

45
00:04:05,134 --> 00:04:06,634
You think that's just coïncidence ?

46
00:04:06,717 --> 00:04:08,134
Maybe he's FBI !

47
00:04:08,276 --> 00:04:09,726
Please, tell me you thought of that.

48
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:12,601
I did...
and I asked his family.

49
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:14,601
And they all say he's FBI.

50
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:17,934
But... when they said it they all
had this look on their face like...

51
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:20,317
there was something that
they weren't saying.

52
00:04:21,587 --> 00:04:23,903
Sort of like the look I've got
on my face right now.

53
00:04:24,003 --> 00:04:26,653
Look, I had a hunch,
and I was right.

54
00:04:26,845 --> 00:04:28,495
Now, he's out on patrol...

55
00:04:28,595 --> 00:04:30,628
he's not going to be back
for a while, so...

56
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:32,503
Come on !

57
00:04:42,602 --> 00:04:44,235
Did you bust this lock open ?

58
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:58,108
You know, this is kinda
weird, but...

59
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,558
if he's FBI, isn't this what
his basement would look like ?

60
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,309
That's... that's what I said...

61
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:08,459
until I saw this.

62
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:16,598
- Does Gray know about this ?
- No.

63
00:05:16,798 --> 00:05:19,739
I wanted to get a second opinion
before I told anyone.

64
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:22,432
What do you want to do ?

65
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:13,759
Don't.

66
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:25,431

71
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:44,999
Hand it over.

72
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:47,299
Nice and slow.

73
00:06:51,405 --> 00:06:52,938
Slide it over.

74
00:06:57,127 --> 00:06:58,539
What the hell are
you doing here ?

75
00:06:58,556 --> 00:07:00,672
Did you wipe out 23
American cities ?

76
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,080
- Get out of my house.
- Answer the question !

77
00:07:03,114 --> 00:07:05,997
- Why would you even think that ?
- You've got a working generator...

78
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:07,447
and a food supply.

79
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,703
So like you knew the
attacks were coming.

80
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,077
- I'm gonna give you 10 seconds...
- Back up !

81
00:07:12,277 --> 00:07:13,450
Jimmy knows I'm here.

82
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:15,143
If I don't call him off
when he gets back...

83
00:07:15,157 --> 00:07:17,573
you're gonna have a lot more
people than me to deal with.

84
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,540
I'm an FBI agent, Jake.

85
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,323
That's what I heard.

86
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,046
Problem is the radio was reporting
the terrorists used

87
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:27,054
forged FBI badges to get
their bombs into position.

88
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:29,454
What is that room ?

89
00:07:30,923 --> 00:07:32,990
How were you involved
in all of this ?

90
00:07:34,173 --> 00:07:35,540
I need to know.

91
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:42,057
5 months ago, this was
a map of our country.

92
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:44,340
Now, it's an antique.

93
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,815
It's a picture of the way
things used to be.

94
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:50,433
Right now...

95
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:54,710
all we're sure of is this.

96
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,377
But this is where we
start to rebuild.

97
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:01,274
So how do we do it ?

98
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,640
How ?

99
00:08:04,007 --> 00:08:05,574
We look to our history.

100
00:08:05,957 --> 00:08:08,424
We study the people
that came before us.

101
00:08:10,332 --> 00:08:12,640
- Are you going to take attendance ?
- No.

102
00:08:15,106 --> 00:08:16,373
Where are you going ?

103
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,986
My mom's at home right now...

104
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,186
trying to grow beets out of our
bathtub so we can eat newt month.

105
00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:24,137
This stuff...
isn't important.

106
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:38,921
I guess school's out
early today.

107
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:42,737
You don't have to stay
if you don't want to.

108
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,169
I don't think I should be hanging
around at home right now.

109
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:50,223
So, I guess I'm stuck here.

110
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,865
<i>So it's come to this...

111
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,657
I want you to know this has nothing
to do with you personnally, I'm...

112
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:58,890
sure you're...

113
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:00,573
wonderfull.

114
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:06,723
But let's be honest here, you're
the one that lays the fewest eggs

115
00:09:06,724 --> 00:09:09,539
and I distinctly told all of you
that this was going to happen.

116
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,631
I believe I made myself perfectly
clear in that regard.

117
00:09:13,455 --> 00:09:14,455
All right.

118
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:16,822
The thing is...

119
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:20,055
If you knew me at all,
you would...

120
00:09:20,538 --> 00:09:22,005
see how really funny this is,

121
00:09:22,022 --> 00:09:23,855
because this is so not my thing.

122
00:09:23,888 --> 00:09:25,822
No... this is Stanley's thing.

123
00:09:26,738 --> 00:09:29,472
It's just... I'm awfully hungry.

124
00:09:29,555 --> 00:09:33,255
And... I don't want to get into the
whole circle of life business, but...

125
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:35,822
I just cannot eat anymore sprouts.

126
00:09:37,864 --> 00:09:40,114
OK ? Enough stalling...
Here we go...

127
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,980
Here's my concern...

128
00:09:44,047 --> 00:09:46,530
I've heard stories about how you're
gonna react to this, and

129
00:09:46,555 --> 00:09:49,955
if I see half of you running around,
well I just know I'm gonna freak out.

130
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:53,376
So if you could do your best
to minimize that part of it...

131
00:09:53,617 --> 00:09:55,517
I'd just really appreciate it.

132
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,375
Sprouts it is.

133
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,920
You really out here
looking for deer?

134
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,002
Thought they were all gone.

135
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:34,278
What do you want Harry ?

136
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:37,840
Do you think you could come
into city hall today ?

137
00:10:37,873 --> 00:10:39,255
Gray’s still out, and
it’d be nice to have...

138
00:10:39,256 --> 00:10:41,106
somebody around who knows
what they're doing.

139
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:44,618
Not my job anymore, and get lost,
I'm trying to shoot some deer.

140
00:10:44,914 --> 00:10:46,581
Just be for a day or two.

141
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:53,464
You're starting to look an
awful lot like a deer, Harry.

142
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:04,004
I've been in the FBI
for 15 years.

143
00:11:05,704 --> 00:11:09,271
I worked law enforcement after college,
and then I joined the bureau.

144
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,421
Where did you go to school ?

145
00:11:10,454 --> 00:11:12,471
Georgetown, you wanna see my ring ?

146
00:11:13,821 --> 00:11:15,804
The FBI, what were
you working on ?

147
00:11:15,886 --> 00:11:17,986
I was sent here to monitor
the phone calls

148
00:11:17,987 --> 00:11:21,102
made in the area to a...
suspected terrorist cell.

149
00:11:21,936 --> 00:11:23,802
- And what did you find out ?
- Nothing.

150
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:25,069
Trail went dead.

151
00:11:25,336 --> 00:11:26,736
We about done here ?

152
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:29,491
Not even close.

153
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:32,741
Tell me about her...
Sarah Mason.

154
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:35,024
She's gone.

155
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:45,712
You're pretty thorough.

156
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:48,662
Also took care of the one
in the cabinet

157
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:50,535
and the one behind
the water heater.

158
00:11:51,185 --> 00:11:53,768
There's only one loaded
gun in this house...

159
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:55,935
and it's mine.
Sit down.

160
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:02,771
Arms behind you.

161
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:10,121
Tell me about Sarah.

162
00:12:10,903 --> 00:12:13,686
Jimmy said she was also
a cop in St Louis.

163
00:12:14,886 --> 00:12:16,469
She's working with you ?

164
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:18,986
Against you ?

165
00:12:19,969 --> 00:12:20,969
Who are these people ?

166
00:12:21,086 --> 00:12:23,069
You are making a serious mistake.

167
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:26,396
- I am a Federal Officer.
- Really ?

168
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,829
Really sure you're not.

169
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:33,063
Robert Willer...
State Department.

170
00:12:33,788 --> 00:12:36,571
How about Robert Snyder...
Colombus PD ?

171
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:40,588
Commander Robert Richmond...
Naval Intelligence.

172
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,003
None of those are real...
and neither is that badge.

173
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:46,953
Who the hell are you ?

174
00:12:47,336 --> 00:12:48,794
Who do you you work for ?

175
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,949
You do not wanna know
what I know.

176
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:59,016
- I think I can handle it.
- Really ?

177
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,516
Cause I can barely handle it,
and I was trained for this.

178
00:13:01,517 --> 00:13:04,557
You want to tell me...
or you tell the whole town.

179
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:10,602
All right.

180
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:14,352
But once you hear this...

181
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:18,766
You are a part of it, Jake,
and there is no going back.

182
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,333
Who do you work for ?

183
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:23,766
CIA.

184
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:28,666
Sarah Mason and I were part of
an off-the-books team.

185
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:31,631
We were tracking the bombs
used in the attack.

186
00:13:31,814 --> 00:13:33,981
Where did they come from...
the bombs ?

187
00:13:34,297 --> 00:13:36,231
The US government
brought them in.

188
00:13:37,581 --> 00:13:39,847
See, after the Soviet Union fell...

189
00:13:39,998 --> 00:13:42,864
neglected military in the
satellite republics started

190
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,460
selling their nuclear stockpiles
on the black market.

191
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:48,198
So the CIA started
an operation...

192
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,727
get that material by any
and all means necessary.

193
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:54,577
But a few years ago, a shipment
disappeared on its way

194
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:57,618
to the DOE storage complex
in Oak Ridge.

195
00:13:57,951 --> 00:14:00,501
And that is where my
CIA team came in.

196
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,580
Why you ?

197
00:14:01,863 --> 00:14:03,313
I'm the best at what I do.

198
00:14:03,747 --> 00:14:04,963
And what is that ?

199
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:07,847
Satellite installation.

200
00:14:28,975 --> 00:14:31,692
I have a 2 o'clock appointment
with Mr. Higgins.

201
00:14:34,794 --> 00:14:37,911
I've been inside all day.
How's the weather out there ?

202
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,678
You know, it looks like rain.

203
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:49,358
Thank you.

204
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:02,729
- Hello Victor.
- Hawkins.

205
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:05,812
I believe you know
everyone here...

206
00:15:06,816 --> 00:15:08,199
except this young lady.

207
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,116
- Robert Hawkins.
- Sarah Mason.

208
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,432
All right, let's get down to it.

209
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:16,716
We have a lot of
ground to cover.

210
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:20,649
As most of you know...

211
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:23,782
a shipment of nukes from
project Red Bell is missing.

212
00:15:24,897 --> 00:15:26,022
What you don't know...

213
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:28,555
is that we have quality intel
that those warheads...

214
00:15:28,614 --> 00:15:31,047
have been converted
into 25 small...

215
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,047
high yield devices.

216
00:15:33,238 --> 00:15:36,221
These bombs have been
dissiminated to extremists cells

217
00:15:36,271 --> 00:15:38,505
active within the United States.

218
00:15:40,671 --> 00:15:42,271
So, is this Al Qaeda ?

219
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:44,294
I wish it were that simple.

220
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,378
It's much larger than that.

221
00:15:47,378 --> 00:15:49,444
It's a cross section of
domestic militias...

222
00:15:49,544 --> 00:15:51,944
anarchists,
and religious fanatics.

223
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:55,177
As you can see,
these are terrorists...

224
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:58,610
that would never collaborate,
ideologically or politically.

225
00:15:58,743 --> 00:16:00,809
The only thing that links
them, is the desire

226
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,827
to take down the
federal government.

227
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:06,010
Our job, is to get undercover
in these cells...

228
00:16:06,451 --> 00:16:08,068
and find these bombs.

229
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,218
So who do we think
is orchestrating this ?

230
00:16:10,354 --> 00:16:12,354
The agency's been at this
from every angle...

231
00:16:12,587 --> 00:16:15,437
and all we know is that
he's got deep ressources,

232
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:17,895
an ability to coordinate
diverse groups,

233
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:21,295
and by all indications...
he's an American.

234
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:28,229
We were broken up
into groups of two.

235
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,971
Each unit was...
assigned a terrorist cell.

236
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,490
One agent went undercover,
one acted as a handler.

237
00:16:37,457 --> 00:16:39,790
You can't expect me to believe
you were sent here...

238
00:16:39,814 --> 00:16:40,822
undercover.

239
00:16:40,823 --> 00:16:42,473
What's so special
about this place ?

240
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,594
You know, I would
show you, but...

241
00:16:45,911 --> 00:16:47,311
That's clever.

242
00:16:48,596 --> 00:16:50,796
It's over there...
behind the map.

243
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,495
Where did you get this ?

244
00:17:10,607 --> 00:17:14,940
Those are defense department projections
they've been doing since the 50s.

245
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,540
The fallout scenarios in the event of
a nuclear attack on 20 US cities.

246
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,290
And you see Jericho ?

247
00:17:21,694 --> 00:17:23,744
It's outside the fallout zones, Jake.

248
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:25,809
It's got a salt mine,
plenty of farm land,

249
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,060
and access to an untainted
water table.

250
00:17:28,135 --> 00:17:30,035
So you weren't here to
monitor phone calls ?

251
00:17:30,052 --> 00:17:32,735
Jericho was a rally-point in case
we failed in our mission.

252
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:33,895
Failed ?

253
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:36,162
Or succeeded ?

254
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:41,362
And Johnston, was...

255
00:17:43,331 --> 00:17:45,597
He wanted to come,
I know he did.

256
00:17:46,197 --> 00:17:49,197
He's just having a hard time
dealing with things lately.

257
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:51,514
He always gets quiet...

258
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:54,013
when he's going through
something, but...

259
00:17:54,063 --> 00:17:56,163
just wish I could think
of something

260
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,213
to help him get through this.

261
00:18:05,015 --> 00:18:07,015
We miss you, sweetheart.

262
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,561
There's no more sprouts.

263
00:18:19,028 --> 00:18:20,295
You finished them ?

264
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:21,978
I was hungry.

265
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:26,808
What are you doing here, Sean.
It's like 9:30 in the morning...

266
00:18:26,825 --> 00:18:27,825
Oh, my...

267
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,691
You slept here ?

268
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:34,158
Well, actually... there was not a
lot of sleeping going on.

269
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:36,708
Get out of the house !

270
00:18:44,593 --> 00:18:45,634
What are you doing ?

271
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:48,068
- You let him spend a night ?
- Yes.

272
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:51,434
Well that doesn't seem like something
Stanley would approve of, does it ?

273
00:18:51,524 --> 00:18:53,107
Stanley's not here.

274
00:18:56,324 --> 00:19:00,291
Just like that. You infiltrated a
terror cell planning a nuclear attack ?

275
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:02,382
Yeah...

276
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:04,879
just like that.

277
00:19:05,699 --> 00:19:07,316
It took me 2 years.

278
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:09,632
8 months of it in prison...

279
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,899
developing contacts,
getting into the network.

280
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:15,407
The only outside person I
communicated with was my handler.

281
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:17,199
After prison,
I spent another year

282
00:19:17,216 --> 00:19:19,607
trying to gain their trust
on the outside.

283
00:19:19,757 --> 00:19:22,124
And even then, I was only
scratching the surface.

284
00:19:22,157 --> 00:19:23,157
But you got in.

285
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
How ?

286
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,624
They were looking for
high grade government IDs.

287
00:19:31,824 --> 00:19:33,257
You gave them their badges !

288
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,487
I had to proove that I was loyal
and valuable to the cell, Jake.

289
00:19:36,554 --> 00:19:38,804
- I think I've heard enough.
- No !

290
00:19:38,904 --> 00:19:40,787
You barely scratched
the surface.

291
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:44,253
You're the one who
wanted to hear this,

292
00:19:44,612 --> 00:19:46,604
so why don't you hear it all ?

293
00:20:00,486 --> 00:20:02,415
The cell was looking for IDs.

294
00:20:03,605 --> 00:20:06,709
And I needed to get higher up
in their organisation.

295
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:09,413
So I let it be known
that I had a source.

296
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:11,096
See, the badges...

297
00:20:11,112 --> 00:20:14,262
were going to be tagged so that
my team could track them.

298
00:20:15,104 --> 00:20:18,470
They sent me to make the buy
with another cell member.

299
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:20,851
It was a kid named Daryl.

300
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:22,718
How do we know
these are real ?

301
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:24,534
They're real enough.

302
00:20:24,918 --> 00:20:26,089
Where did you get them from ?

303
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:28,584
How and where I got these
badges... is my business.

304
00:20:28,618 --> 00:20:30,951
What you do with them...
is yours.

305
00:20:46,756 --> 00:20:49,139
- Nice doing business with you.
- You too.

306
00:20:51,739 --> 00:20:54,339
We should celebrate, man.
Go out, get some girls.

307
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:58,376
Except you don't really seem
like the type. All serious.

308
00:20:58,593 --> 00:20:59,726
Are you married ?

309
00:21:00,276 --> 00:21:01,284
I was.

310
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:03,743
Really ?
What happened ?

311
00:21:05,234 --> 00:21:06,734
What the hell is going on ?

312
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:14,599
Hold it right there !

313
00:21:17,266 --> 00:21:18,432
I'm sorry man.

314
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:20,749
You gotta be kidding me.

315
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,307
FBI !
Hands in the air !

316
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,540
Back against the car.

317
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:37,776
<i>It turns out Daryl was
an FBI informant.

318
00:21:38,342 --> 00:21:41,492
But my handler got me out,
and we kept my cover intact.

319
00:21:42,056 --> 00:21:45,540
So the FBI have an informant
in my target cell.

320
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,856
And they can't tell us
anything about that ?

321
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:50,390
You know, I'm damn lucky
that my cover wasn't blown.

322
00:21:50,473 --> 00:21:52,940
- Your cover's intact, yes ?
- Yeah, we believe so.

323
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,245
Then let's move on.

324
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:57,479
Have you been able to make contact
with those coordinating the attack ?

325
00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:00,895
No... but at this stage, I recommend
that we take down the cells

326
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:02,262
that we've already inflitrated.

327
00:22:02,312 --> 00:22:05,129
You know, at the very least that
would disrupt the overall plan...

328
00:22:05,296 --> 00:22:08,738
maybe delay it for...
- How many of the bombs can you get ?

329
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,070
A third, for sure...
half if we're lucky.

330
00:22:14,053 --> 00:22:15,286
Look... I know...

331
00:22:15,287 --> 00:22:18,503
it's not ideal, but at this stage,
it is the safest move.

332
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,162
That's still a dozen
bombs in play.

333
00:22:21,186 --> 00:22:23,702
- What are you doing ?
- I just think there's a way to...

334
00:22:23,836 --> 00:22:26,036
speed this up and get
all the bombs at once.

335
00:22:26,037 --> 00:22:28,486
- Yeah, and we agreed that...
- Do you mind ?

336
00:22:31,372 --> 00:22:34,722
I think there may be a way
to get us further inside.

337
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:39,255
My partner tells the cell leader
that Daryl is the FBI informant.

338
00:22:39,356 --> 00:22:42,906
That gives him the credibility
that he needs to move up faster.

339
00:22:43,122 --> 00:22:45,055
Then let us handle the FBI...

340
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:48,155
and do whatever is necessary
to save the operation.

341
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:53,009
- It's all gonna take some time,
but we're close  - OK.

342
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:56,793
We're counting on you,
and you know the risks.

343
00:23:06,975 --> 00:23:08,808
You'd better be right about this.

344
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,964
This is the right way to go.

345
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:20,381
Trust me.

346
00:23:29,147 --> 00:23:30,580
What would you have done ?

347
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,630
Stayed in,
or pulled the plug ?

348
00:23:32,646 --> 00:23:34,871
It seems like the wrong
question to me.

349
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:39,091
I'd ask myself how much
I trusted my partner.

350
00:24:00,118 --> 00:24:04,009
Well, if I can sneak up here without
you so much as turning around...

351
00:24:04,326 --> 00:24:06,309
how are you gonna
hear any game ?

352
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:09,100
I heard you half a mile
back in those shoes.

353
00:24:10,621 --> 00:24:13,171
You said you'd come with me
to see April today.

354
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,221
Fine.

355
00:24:19,288 --> 00:24:21,021
You coming home for dinner ?

356
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:29,128
There are no deer in these woods,
they've all been picked clean.

357
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:31,761
Then, I guess I'll
be here a while.

358
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,627
I never wanted to be a mom'.

359
00:24:47,393 --> 00:24:48,827
I didn't sign up for this.

360
00:24:49,735 --> 00:24:52,519
You know what, you're right.
I owe it to Stanley.

361
00:24:52,785 --> 00:24:54,669
So I'm just gonna have
to jump in...

362
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:57,993
with both feet, whether she wants
to hear from me or not.

363
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,506
Listen to me going on
about my own problems.

364
00:25:01,507 --> 00:25:04,857
You must be ady to take this hatchet
and do the damn job yourself.

365
00:25:27,297 --> 00:25:29,314
I didn't know that he
knew how to sign.

366
00:25:30,805 --> 00:25:32,138
What did he say to you ?

367
00:25:32,655 --> 00:25:33,905
Never mind, look...

368
00:25:33,971 --> 00:25:35,305
That boy's bad news.

369
00:25:35,555 --> 00:25:37,505
Now, I can't stop you
from seeing him...

370
00:25:37,572 --> 00:25:41,238
but he is no longer welcome in this
house, do you understand me ?

371
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:56,439
Allison...

372
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,389
so why do you feel like you
can't hang out at home ?

373
00:26:01,302 --> 00:26:03,352
You don't have to talk to me
if you don't want to.

374
00:26:03,368 --> 00:26:05,166
It's not that I don't wanna
talk about it.

375
00:26:05,316 --> 00:26:06,316
It's just...

376
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:08,350
my family's pretty weird.

377
00:26:09,183 --> 00:26:10,983
My family was pretty weird too.

378
00:26:11,016 --> 00:26:13,983
In fact, when I was your age, I didn't
want to hang out with them either.

379
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:15,140
What about now ?

380
00:26:16,507 --> 00:26:17,590
They're gone.

381
00:26:21,134 --> 00:26:23,233
There's this thing that went
down at my house...

382
00:26:23,284 --> 00:26:24,534
a couple weeks ago.

383
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:28,109
I did something.

384
00:26:28,997 --> 00:26:31,097
OK. What did you do ?

385
00:26:32,647 --> 00:26:35,513
I did something that...
can't be forgiven.

386
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,779
Now my mom just keeps...

387
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:41,529
looking at me.

388
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,944
Like I've changed into some kind
of monster, or something.

389
00:26:49,477 --> 00:26:51,077
You know you haven't, right ?

390
00:26:55,154 --> 00:26:57,478
So... even though you
weren't sure about the plan,

391
00:26:57,479 --> 00:26:59,604
you outed the informant
to the cell leader.

392
00:27:00,646 --> 00:27:02,746
Once we decided to leave
the bombs in play,

393
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:05,312
it was the only way for me to
get deep enough into the cell

394
00:27:05,313 --> 00:27:06,546
and gain their trust.

395
00:27:06,629 --> 00:27:09,179
I told the cell leader that
Daryl was the informant,

396
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,929
but I wanted to get him out of there
before they killed him.

397
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:14,362
Come on, grab what you
need and let's go.

398
00:27:15,245 --> 00:27:17,812
They're gonna hunt me down,
and they're gonna kill me.

399
00:27:17,986 --> 00:27:19,336
It's your lucky day, Daryl.

400
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,870
They're gonna get you into witness
protection, so don't worry.

401
00:27:21,886 --> 00:27:23,736
We're gonna get
you out of here.

402
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,019
Stay there.

403
00:27:32,633 --> 00:27:34,433
- Damn it !
- What is it ?

404
00:27:34,849 --> 00:27:36,583
<i>Daryl, we just wanna talk.

405
00:27:36,966 --> 00:27:38,033
The cell leader.

406
00:28:07,588 --> 00:28:09,272
You gotta get me
out of this place.

407
00:28:09,305 --> 00:28:10,305
Run !

408
00:28:10,497 --> 00:28:11,872
I'll tell them that
you got away.

409
00:28:11,905 --> 00:28:14,838
I think my leg is broken.
Please, help me !

410
00:28:15,954 --> 00:28:18,338
Or I'm gonna tell them
who you really are.

411
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:22,038
I'm sorry.

412
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,169
<i>So, I finally gain their trust.

413
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:01,089
<i>I was in.

414
00:29:03,762 --> 00:29:04,779
You killed him.

415
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,400
It was either killed him...

416
00:29:12,883 --> 00:29:15,050
or possibly let millions
of people die.

417
00:29:15,217 --> 00:29:16,350
They died anyway.

418
00:29:38,664 --> 00:29:39,664
<i>Jake ?

419
00:29:40,031 --> 00:29:41,431
<i>You're still down there ?

420
00:29:41,764 --> 00:29:42,764
Call him off.

421
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,914
You're not helping your cause by
keeping that gun in my face.

422
00:29:45,998 --> 00:29:47,081
<i>Hey, Jake ?

423
00:29:47,264 --> 00:29:49,198
Do not make me kill him Jake.

424
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,514
All right.

425
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:56,864
- All right !
<i>- Jake ?

426
00:30:03,604 --> 00:30:04,754
What's going on, Jake ?

427
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:06,637
We need a little more
time, that's all.

428
00:30:06,645 --> 00:30:09,221
- You're sure ?
- Yeah, we're all right.

429
00:30:10,983 --> 00:30:13,233
- I... I'm out front.
- OK.

430
00:30:27,301 --> 00:30:28,501
Turn around, Jake.

431
00:30:45,047 --> 00:30:46,980
It is not about this anymore.

432
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:48,596
We're past this.

433
00:30:51,137 --> 00:30:53,037
Starting now,
we trust each other.

434
00:30:54,587 --> 00:30:56,487
You need to tell me everything.

435
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:57,645
Done telling.

436
00:30:58,104 --> 00:30:59,428
Now, I gotta show you.

437
00:31:10,728 --> 00:31:11,978
What are you doing here ?

438
00:31:12,111 --> 00:31:14,044
It's your first day
at a new school.

439
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:19,014
You know, the last time you had one
of those, Sam was in diapers.

440
00:31:21,664 --> 00:31:24,148
Doesn'’t look like you
had a big turnout.

441
00:31:24,688 --> 00:31:27,138
No, most people left early.

442
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:29,388
I guess you knew better.

443
00:31:31,768 --> 00:31:34,934
I figured you didn't really want
me around the house anyway.

444
00:31:37,568 --> 00:31:39,168
Why would you say that ?

445
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:43,236
You know...

446
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:44,969
because of what I did.

447
00:31:48,469 --> 00:31:49,802
Allison, I love you.

448
00:31:50,636 --> 00:31:52,369
OK ? Nothing will
change that.

449
00:31:54,391 --> 00:31:55,391
Hear me baby ?

450
00:31:56,558 --> 00:31:58,225
Nothing will change that.

451
00:32:00,225 --> 00:32:01,225
My little girl.

452
00:32:05,003 --> 00:32:08,070
Mom, please
don't be mad at me.

453
00:32:09,187 --> 00:32:10,737
I'm so sorry, mom'.

454
00:32:25,532 --> 00:32:27,599
- Here's the part I don't get.
- What ?

455
00:32:27,632 --> 00:32:29,632
If you're telling the truth...

456
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:31,915
you made it.

457
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:35,715
You made it deep inside the cell,
you gained their trust.

458
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:37,331
Right.

459
00:32:38,014 --> 00:32:39,414
Then, what happened ?

460
00:32:42,464 --> 00:32:44,581
Somebody tipped off the
terrorists, Jake.

461
00:32:45,886 --> 00:32:47,603
Before we could find out who...

462
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,870
<i>the terrorists moved up
their plan.

463
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:52,791
Victor ?

464
00:32:52,874 --> 00:32:55,482
We made a mistake,
<i>a very big mistake.</i>

465
00:32:56,524 --> 00:32:59,174
This is the moment we prepared for.

466
00:32:59,735 --> 00:33:03,218
Strike will go off tomorrow,
at precisely 8:05 Eastern.

467
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:06,668
OK. No... listen !

468
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:07,735
The trucks...

469
00:33:08,285 --> 00:33:09,285
they're white.

470
00:33:09,418 --> 00:33:13,901
License plate
Kansas, 5-4-3, George, Union, Ida...

471
00:33:14,401 --> 00:33:16,335
<i>I tried to warn the agency...

472
00:33:16,735 --> 00:33:18,135
<i>but we were too late.

473
00:33:22,996 --> 00:33:25,196
Some of the bombs were meant
for New York.

474
00:33:25,325 --> 00:33:27,109
We managed to head them off.

475
00:33:32,525 --> 00:33:34,458
Even after 4 years of work...

476
00:33:34,874 --> 00:33:36,808
I couldn't stop all of them.

477
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:41,805
<i>I'm gonna have to live with that
for the rest of my life.

478
00:33:59,273 --> 00:34:01,040
Since when have
you been funny ?

479
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:02,874
I have always been funny.

480
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,074
Yeah, not for a long time.

481
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,245
What is it Rob ?

482
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:25,929
- Rob ?
- I won't be long.

483
00:34:35,709 --> 00:34:37,326
Not interrupting, am I ?

484
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:39,476
You know you are.

485
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,307
You're not exactly
returning our calls.

486
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:44,065
I told my wife I was done.

487
00:34:45,265 --> 00:34:46,265
I promised her, Victor.

488
00:34:48,477 --> 00:34:50,543
- We need you back.
- Why me ?

489
00:34:50,677 --> 00:34:52,277
Because you're the best
at what you do.

490
00:34:52,293 --> 00:34:53,477
Which is what ?

491
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,410
Your family will be there,
when you get back.

492
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:01,376
Team is meeting tomorrow.

493
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,100
Come listen to what this
is all about.

494
00:35:04,417 --> 00:35:06,308
If you wanna walk
away after that...

495
00:35:06,642 --> 00:35:07,642
you walk away.

496
00:35:12,474 --> 00:35:13,674
2 o'clock...

497
00:35:14,341 --> 00:35:15,341
tomorrow.

498
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:19,124
Tell the desk jockey you have an
appointment with Mr. Higgins.

499
00:35:20,191 --> 00:35:22,291
If they ask about the weather...

500
00:35:23,258 --> 00:35:24,924
tell hem it's gonna rain.

501
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:33,119
Who was that ?

502
00:35:43,888 --> 00:35:46,588
I might need to go
to a meeting tomorow.

503
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:50,388
I can't keep doing this,
I can't.

504
00:35:51,888 --> 00:35:53,021
We'll be fine, D.

505
00:36:10,177 --> 00:36:11,177
What is that ?

506
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,277
It's the end of the
rabbit hole, Jake.

507
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:19,666
Gimme a hand with this.

508
00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:33,843
So you believe me now ?

509
00:36:44,783 --> 00:36:46,649
Is that what I think it is ?

510
00:36:47,983 --> 00:36:50,649
It was meant for Columbus, Ohio.

511
00:36:51,686 --> 00:36:54,603
You brought a nuclear bomb...
here.

512
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,703
What would you have
done with it ?

513
00:36:58,353 --> 00:37:00,020
What do you gonna do with it ?

514
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,374
I'm gonna keep it safe.

515
00:37:04,624 --> 00:37:07,224
I'm gonna keep it secret,
you know. Because...

516
00:37:08,461 --> 00:37:12,261
it gives the town some power, Jake,
but it also makes them a target.

517
00:37:12,527 --> 00:37:13,527
Look...

518
00:37:15,888 --> 00:37:17,554
I know what you're thinking...

519
00:37:17,754 --> 00:37:20,521
You're wishing you'd walked away
when I gave you the chance, right ?

520
00:37:20,522 --> 00:37:23,016
Why didn’t you show me thing
when I walked in the door today.

521
00:37:23,017 --> 00:37:24,388
You didn't walk in.

522
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,377
<i>Jake ?

523
00:37:28,427 --> 00:37:29,440
<i>Hey, Jake ?

524
00:37:32,052 --> 00:37:33,614
I've been watching you, Jake...

525
00:37:33,698 --> 00:37:35,364
and you can handle yourself.

526
00:37:35,481 --> 00:37:37,948
And I've seen what a help
you have been to this stown.

527
00:37:37,993 --> 00:37:40,110
But I needed to know
that I can trust you.

528
00:37:40,243 --> 00:37:42,960
That you could handle it
if I told you everything.

529
00:37:43,826 --> 00:37:44,826
<i>Jake ?

530
00:37:47,276 --> 00:37:48,276
This bomb...

531
00:37:49,748 --> 00:37:51,148
it's our burden, now.

532
00:37:52,215 --> 00:37:53,815
Whatever happens next...

533
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,798
that is gonna be
up to you. OK ?

534
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:22,565
He's FBI.

535
00:38:23,398 --> 00:38:24,598
Just like he said.

536
00:38:25,315 --> 00:38:26,315
But...

537
00:38:27,281 --> 00:38:28,615
We're in good hands.

538
00:38:30,165 --> 00:38:31,503
That's good to hear.

539
00:38:32,755 --> 00:38:34,975
I'm sorry about all this,
Mr. Hawkins.

540
00:39:00,837 --> 00:39:02,824
We do that, outside.

541
00:39:04,861 --> 00:39:06,126
I didn't know that.

542
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:11,881
There’s something
I want to say to you.

543
00:39:13,006 --> 00:39:14,400
I'm still learning...

544
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:16,723
so just, please bear with me.

545
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:26,365
Stanley...
is...

546
00:39:27,268 --> 00:39:29,901
important...
to me.

547
00:39:31,612 --> 00:39:35,844
You... are...
important... to me.

548
00:39:38,046 --> 00:39:43,362
I... want... you...
to be safe.

549
00:39:45,131 --> 00:39:49,621
So please... be patient...
with me.

550
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,763
I'm trying...

551
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:56,884
I'll try too.

552
00:39:58,484 --> 00:39:59,491
So...

553
00:40:00,575 --> 00:40:01,581
hug ?

554
00:40:06,302 --> 00:40:07,309
Right.

555
00:40:23,326 --> 00:40:25,055
I brought you some dinner.

556
00:40:30,573 --> 00:40:31,580
Thank you.

557
00:40:58,632 --> 00:41:01,915
<i>You know what, I am damn lucky
that my cover wasn’t blown.

558
00:41:02,354 --> 00:41:04,238
<i>- Your cover's intact ?
- Yeah, we believe so.

559
00:41:04,306 --> 00:41:05,321
<i>Then let's move on.

560
00:41:05,347 --> 00:41:07,773
<i>But at this stage, I recommend
that we take down the cells

561
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,967
<i>that we've already
infiltrated...

562
00:41:10,831 --> 00:41:13,438
<i>How many of the bombs
can you get ?

563
00:41:40,455 --> 00:41:42,855
How many of the bombs
can you get ?

564
