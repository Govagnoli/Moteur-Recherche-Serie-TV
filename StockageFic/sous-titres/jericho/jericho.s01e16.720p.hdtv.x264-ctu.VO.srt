00:00:00,103 --> 00:00:01,526
<i>Previously on </i>Jericho

2
00:00:01,527 --> 00:00:03,656
When were you planning
on telling me about the baby?

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,220
A bad marriage doesn't get better
because you add a kid.

4
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:08,766
I didn't want you to stay with me
because of the baby, Eric.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,330
Heather!

6
00:00:10,754 --> 00:00:11,797
My God.

7
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:14,757
Uh... Jake, this is Ted Lewis.

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,022
We grew up together
over in New Bern.

9
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:18,412
This is Russell and Mike.

10
00:00:18,413 --> 00:00:19,421
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.

11
00:00:19,422 --> 00:00:20,963
With a dozen full-size windmills,

12
00:00:20,964 --> 00:00:22,242
you could power the whole town.

13
00:00:22,243 --> 00:00:24,698
I'm going to help turn the lights on
for everyone back home.

14
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,901
- Just going to leave?
- It won't be for very long.

15
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:31,786
I have something
in my possession

16
00:00:31,938 --> 00:00:34,970
and it puts you, me and the kids
in danger here.

17
00:00:34,988 --> 00:00:36,868
Sarah is not on our side.

18
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,713
She's not here to help us.

19
00:00:38,812 --> 00:00:40,740
Hawkins is starting
to put the pieces together.

20
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:43,049
- He needs to be eliminated.
- I know.

21
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,680
Why are you stalling on this one?

22
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:53,990
How can I be sure
you won't follow me?

23
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:55,006
I won't follow you.

24
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:56,968
Not if I take your son with me,
you won't.

25
00:01:57,471 --> 00:01:59,829
Honey, you look tired.

26
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:01,371
You getting enough sleep?

27
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:03,103
Almost seven hours.

28
00:02:03,398 --> 00:02:04,899
- Where?
- In my office.

29
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:07,432
Sleeping in your office
doesn't count.

30
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:09,561
You're going to give
the baby a crick in its neck.

31
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,290
You're going to make
a terrific grandmother.

32
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,010
- I know.
- You're Dr. Green? - Yes.

33
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:15,137
Jessica Williams.
Nice to meet you.

34
00:02:15,472 --> 00:02:17,737
Mr. Ostrowski says
he's having chest pains.

35
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,827
He doesn't want anybody
to look at him but you.

36
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,159
Are you the doctor
who came in with the refugees?

37
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,099
Close. Third-year med student,
University of Chicago.

38
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,190
And I prefer
"visitor" to "refugee."

39
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,206
I'm sorry.
Thanks for the help.

40
00:02:29,742 --> 00:02:30,774
Don't thank me.

41
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,905
I'm just working here
'cause I get to sleep in a bed

42
00:02:32,906 --> 00:02:34,486
instead of the church basement.

43
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:36,483
Where do I start?

44
00:02:38,132 --> 00:02:40,330
Pneumonia,
malnutrition, hypothermia.

45
00:02:40,331 --> 00:02:41,992
Just grab a chart
and pick a patient.

46
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:46,911
- Mr. Hawkins?
- Hey, Jim.

47
00:02:47,394 --> 00:02:49,042
Hope I didn't wake the kids.

48
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:50,570
No, you're okay.

49
00:02:51,683 --> 00:02:53,599
Mine are the same way.
Up at all hours.

50
00:02:53,826 --> 00:02:54,918
Worse when we had TV.

51
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,654
Is there something
I can do for you, Jim?

52
00:02:57,818 --> 00:02:58,958
Sorry. Um...

53
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,899
Mayor Anderson wants me
to keep track of the refugees.

54
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,959
You know,

55
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:04,768
find out where they end up.

56
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:07,248
See what kind of work
they're doing to help the town.

57
00:03:07,651 --> 00:03:08,670
Sarah Mason.

58
00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:10,653
She's been...
staying with you, right?

59
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:16,604
Mr. Hawkins...

60
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:20,143
It's freezing out here. Uh...

61
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:22,596
Is she around?

62
00:03:25,035 --> 00:03:27,421
- Oh, the generator's back on.
- Thank God.

63
00:03:28,846 --> 00:03:29,957
Well, that's it.

64
00:03:29,998 --> 00:03:31,325
We're on our last tank of diesel.

65
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:33,175
Power's out to everything
but the medical center.

66
00:03:33,176 --> 00:03:35,473
Our last tank?
How long will we have power?

67
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,839
Ten, maybe 12 hours,

68
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,608
so turn off anything
you're not using.

69
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:40,055
What about the biodiesel?

70
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,208
We burned through it.

71
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:42,535
We're not going
to have any more for days.

72
00:03:42,536 --> 00:03:44,077
We need to come up
with another plan.

73
00:03:44,078 --> 00:03:46,267
We're getting more and
more people in here every...

74
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:48,171
Oh, God!

75
00:03:50,014 --> 00:03:51,019
April, can you hear me?

76
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,775
Is she breathing?
April, wake up!

77
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,590
Get over here!

00:04:13,522 --> 00:04:15,210
It's colder than a witch's patootie.

83
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:22,557
Using candles.

84
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,698
I saw you had some electric lights on
when I was walking up.

85
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:32,488
I got a geni
in the basement, but, uh...

86
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:35,048
I just used the last of my gas.

87
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:37,291
What were you doing?

88
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,916
I'm putting some stuff
in storage, but, uh...

89
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,487
I was just cleaning up.

90
00:04:46,163 --> 00:04:48,335
Using the last of your fuel
on housework, huh?

91
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:49,702
Darcy's trained you well.

92
00:04:51,578 --> 00:04:52,798
Listen, Jimmy, um...

93
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:54,728
I was just about to turn in, so...

94
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:56,303
Right. Sorry.

95
00:04:56,357 --> 00:04:58,234
Uh, well, like I said,

96
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:01,049
Mayor Anderson's got me keeping
tabs on the refugees, you know.

97
00:05:01,438 --> 00:05:02,590
Crime's up.

98
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,617
So, Sarah Mason.

99
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,845
Is she here?
Can I ask her some questions?

100
00:05:07,846 --> 00:05:09,011
You know, um...

101
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,167
Sarah left yesterday.

102
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:15,646
Something about, uh...

103
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,362
family in New Orleans.

104
00:05:20,124 --> 00:05:21,665
Wow. In this weather?

105
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:26,048
Well, I'm sorry to bother you.

106
00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:27,509
Hey, don't worry about it.

107
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:31,972
You know, that's a...

108
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,157
nasty- looking cut
you got there.

109
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:37,217
Uh, yeah, it was, uh...

110
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,321
tree branch when
I was cutting wood.

111
00:05:41,768 --> 00:05:44,270
- Must have been a real bleeder.
- Hey, it's not too deep.

112
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:47,553
Well, you be careful.

113
00:05:47,692 --> 00:05:49,153
It's dangerous out there.

114
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:51,579
Again, sorry to bother you.

115
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,665
Yes.

116
00:05:57,228 --> 00:05:58,850
I don't feel good.

117
00:05:58,989 --> 00:06:00,745
I'm so tired all of a sudden.

118
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,125
I know.

119
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:04,609
I told you you need
to get some rest.

120
00:06:04,981 --> 00:06:06,388
Here's your big chance.

121
00:06:08,693 --> 00:06:11,187
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you, honey.

122
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:16,159
I'm trying to keep her calm,

123
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,987
but my gut tells me
the baby's having a problem,

124
00:06:18,988 --> 00:06:20,923
and if I know it, she knows it.

125
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:22,947
- What are we going to do?
- Get Kenchy?

126
00:06:23,073 --> 00:06:24,628
There's another doctor in town?

127
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:26,657
The man can barely
sit up on his bar stool.

128
00:06:26,658 --> 00:06:29,043
Look, what I really need is
an ultrasound machine.

129
00:06:29,044 --> 00:06:31,670
Without it, there's no real way
to know what's going on.

130
00:06:31,763 --> 00:06:34,899
Well, maybe we have one that
survived the EMP in the basement.

131
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,508
- I'll go look.
- Good.

132
00:06:36,655 --> 00:06:39,122
You go get your father
and tell him to find Eric.

133
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:40,864
He's the one who should be here.

134
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:49,926
It's the guys from New Bern.

135
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:53,597
They actually built the thing.
I can't believe it.

136
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:55,154
Hey, Russell.

137
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:58,201
- Hey. Sheriff, good to see you.
- Good to see you.

138
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,244
Johnston, you SOB.

139
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:02,749
- How the hell did you lose an election?
- No, the question is,

140
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,598
how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?

141
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:06,295
They get tired of you
being the sheriff?

142
00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:07,551
No, I'm still sheriff.

143
00:07:07,651 --> 00:07:09,007
Just got a little more authority.

144
00:07:10,782 --> 00:07:12,489
Well, this is our new mayor.

145
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,812
This is Gray Anderson.

146
00:07:14,114 --> 00:07:16,089
- Mayor Anderson.
- Nice to meet you.

147
00:07:16,614 --> 00:07:17,853
Congratulations.

148
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,570
Thank you. Thank you.
So, this is the windmill, huh?

149
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:22,764
It's a power-generating wind turbine.

150
00:07:22,765 --> 00:07:25,209
We get about 1,500 watts an hour
out of one of these.

151
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:29,802
- Have you seen Eric?
- No, did you try Mary's?

152
00:07:29,803 --> 00:07:31,979
Yeah. I tried there.
I tried at Bailey's.

153
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:34,658
Does this thing work?
Can we get power from it?

154
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:36,014
Probably some time tomorrow.

155
00:07:36,015 --> 00:07:37,420
Let's get it up as fast as we can.

156
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:39,318
I think we're going to need it
at the medical center.

157
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,152
- You got it.
- There's something wrong with April.

158
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:42,170
What? What is it?

159
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,865
She passed out. They think
there's a problem with the baby.

160
00:07:50,305 --> 00:07:51,846
I'll pick you up at 5:00.

161
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,151
I'll walk.

162
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:57,442
Stanley thinks that you're using
this whole volunteering thing

163
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,217
as an excuse
to see Sean Henthorn.

164
00:07:59,218 --> 00:08:01,210
I'm just following orders
to keep an eye on you.

165
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:03,419
Personally, I don't give
a damn who you date.

166
00:08:04,223 --> 00:08:07,069
I've been volunteering here
since I was 16.

167
00:08:07,477 --> 00:08:09,151
It's not about Sean.

168
00:08:13,103 --> 00:08:15,614
You volunteer for anything? Ever?

169
00:08:25,023 --> 00:08:26,479
Mr. Fredrickson.

170
00:08:26,747 --> 00:08:28,136
Come on, stop.

171
00:08:28,443 --> 00:08:31,524
Gracie gave you beet seed
in exchange for 3% of your farm crop.

172
00:08:31,563 --> 00:08:33,974
That 3% is mine now.
The store was left to me.

173
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,597
I can't do that, Dale.

174
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,071
Things have gotten worse now.

175
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:39,515
I need it for my family,
to feed the last of my livestock.

176
00:08:39,516 --> 00:08:40,586
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:40,636 --> 00:08:42,813
It's the law, Mr. Fredrickson.
It's rightfully mine.

178
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,554
There are no more laws, son.

179
00:08:53,354 --> 00:08:54,760
No.

180
00:08:58,895 --> 00:09:00,101
I volunteered.

181
00:09:00,971 --> 00:09:02,411
So. What do I do?

182
00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:09,627
Empty. Clean. Repeat.

183
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,041
Where the hell is Eric?

184
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,753
Nobody knows.
Dad's getting Bill on it.

185
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:17,577
Her blood pressure's dropping.

186
00:09:24,762 --> 00:09:27,290
- I'm feeling contractions.
- I think she's going into labor.

187
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,729
No, no, I can't.

188
00:09:29,031 --> 00:09:30,504
The baby's only 16 weeks.

189
00:09:31,257 --> 00:09:33,685
I need, I need ritodrine
to stop the labor.

190
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:35,163
I already checked.
We don't have any more.

191
00:09:35,164 --> 00:09:36,703
I'll try to find some nifedipine.

192
00:09:36,937 --> 00:09:38,394
All right, now what are you feeling?

193
00:09:38,395 --> 00:09:40,771
If I lose consciousness,
and you can't find any medicine,

194
00:09:41,273 --> 00:09:42,278
use alcohol.

195
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,035
What do you mean?
What kind of alcohol?

196
00:09:44,236 --> 00:09:46,111
Anything coming out of the still.

197
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,521
Give me a 10% drip.

198
00:09:49,229 --> 00:09:51,456
It'll stop the contractions.

199
00:09:54,418 --> 00:09:56,612
Oh, God, she's bleeding.

200
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,335
Get Kenchy. Now!

201
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:06,176
I'm so cold my mouth is numb.

202
00:10:08,116 --> 00:10:10,959
We need the logs or we're
going to freeze to death.

203
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:13,102
Isn't that what we're doing now?

204
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:16,741
All right. Let's get in the car.

205
00:10:27,624 --> 00:10:28,643
Blanket.

206
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:30,083
Let's turn on the heat.

207
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,418
We can't. I'm sorry.

208
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:33,967
We won't have enough gas to get home.

209
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,197
You know, we could make our own heat.

210
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,674
Don't get any ideas...

211
00:10:45,675 --> 00:10:47,480
I'm not taking my clothes off.

212
00:10:52,617 --> 00:10:54,501
You know how happy you make me.

213
00:10:55,997 --> 00:10:57,855
I'm still not taking my clothes off.

214
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:04,793
Come on!

215
00:11:07,593 --> 00:11:08,652
What's her pressure?

216
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,994
- You smell like a wino.
- Nice to meet you too.

217
00:11:10,995 --> 00:11:13,516
- What's her pressure, please ?
- 80/44 and dropping.

218
00:11:13,517 --> 00:11:15,207
- Is she dilated?
- Two centimeters.

219
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,066
Her contractions are six minutes apart.

220
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:18,984
I need an ultrasound.

221
00:11:19,001 --> 00:11:20,395
I brought some old ones
up from the basement.

222
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:21,607
I'll go check on them now.

223
00:11:23,156 --> 00:11:24,678
- Do we have fresh plasma?
- No.

224
00:11:24,982 --> 00:11:26,183
I need you to find somebody...

225
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:27,577
- With O-negative blood.
- Yes.

226
00:11:27,578 --> 00:11:30,390
And we need
a fetal heart monitor.

227
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:31,938
Do we have that?
No?

228
00:11:32,364 --> 00:11:35,466
I need you to put these on
and monitor the baby's heart rate.

229
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:36,651
Here, put these in your ear.

230
00:11:36,652 --> 00:11:37,786
I'll show you how to listen.

231
00:11:37,787 --> 00:11:38,798
I'm deaf.

232
00:11:43,638 --> 00:11:44,671
Madam?

233
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:46,142
I need you to put these in ears.

234
00:11:46,143 --> 00:11:47,535
I need you to monitor
the baby's heart rate.

235
00:11:47,536 --> 00:11:49,522
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. I will show you how.

236
00:11:49,523 --> 00:11:51,613
Come on, let's go! Please!

237
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,333
Here we go. Put these on.

238
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:55,572
Listen right here.

239
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,772
Now, the higher one,
the fast one.

240
00:11:58,773 --> 00:11:59,933
You hear that?

241
00:12:00,026 --> 00:12:01,198
That's the baby's heart rate.

242
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:02,850
You count 15 seconds,

243
00:12:02,851 --> 00:12:05,453
and then you multiply
that by four.

244
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,492
- To get the beats per minute.
- Perfect

245
00:12:07,802 --> 00:12:10,279
now I will show you
how to take blood pressure

246
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,335
and pulse rate.

247
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,574
All right, let's get ready to lift it.

248
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,716
You want me to settle
a contract dispute?!

249
00:12:18,742 --> 00:12:20,935
Mr. Fredrickson isn't giving
Dale his share.

250
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,838
You're kidding me, right?

251
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,464
I'm trying to get power restored.

252
00:12:24,465 --> 00:12:26,396
I got home robberies all over town.

253
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,812
The refugees are threatening
to break into the food lockup.

254
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:30,425
Okay, we're going to go on three.

255
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:31,535
One...

256
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:32,825
two...

257
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:34,032
three.

258
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,053
There we go.

259
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:39,324
A little higher, a little higher.

260
00:12:39,556 --> 00:12:40,898
Okay, easy

261
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,973
Got it.

262
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:45,518
Watch the rope.

263
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:47,634
There you go.

264
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:49,802
Keep it going.

265
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:51,093
Almost there.

266
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:52,538
You got enough on your side?

267
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:53,983
Keep it taut.

268
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:55,708
Good job, fellas.

269
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,226
How's the baby?

270
00:13:02,227 --> 00:13:03,818
I don't know.
How close is this?

271
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,600
I don't know, hours, at least.
Did you find Eric?

272
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:08,360
No. Bill and the rangers
are out looking for him.

273
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:19,139
Can we buy some more of these things?

274
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:22,197
Yeah. Let's talk about it.

275
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:31,644
<i>Mr. Hawkins!</i>

276
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:33,683
<i>I'm back!</i>

277
00:13:35,618 --> 00:13:37,296
<i>Mr. Hawkins, you around?</i>

278
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:41,993
Just a second!

279
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:57,477
You weren't answering
your front door, so I just...

280
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,244
You doing some yard work?
You need a hand?

281
00:14:01,245 --> 00:14:03,257
No. No, thank you.

282
00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:05,394
I was going to turn some compost.

283
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:07,253
Getting ready to plant
food for the spring.

284
00:14:08,363 --> 00:14:09,550
That's a good idea.

285
00:14:09,628 --> 00:14:11,460
Margaret's planting carrots inside.

286
00:14:12,415 --> 00:14:14,195
They're a super-food,
you know...

287
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:15,652
like broccoli.

288
00:14:16,028 --> 00:14:17,963
You need something, Jimmy?

289
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,170
Gray wants me to find out
what kind of resources

290
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:22,875
Sarah might've taken with her, you know?

291
00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:24,893
Fuel, food. Did she...

292
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,444
drive out of town?
- She didn't drive.

293
00:14:28,883 --> 00:14:30,072
Took a backpack.

294
00:14:30,648 --> 00:14:32,481
Some food...
a tent.

295
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,481
Then just walked out into the cold, huh?

296
00:14:37,219 --> 00:14:38,533
That's crazy.

297
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,273
Maybe Darcy knows something more.

298
00:14:41,304 --> 00:14:42,352
No, I don't think so.

299
00:14:42,712 --> 00:14:43,870
I just figured,

300
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:47,077
you know, women talk, and who knows
what the hell they say, right?

301
00:14:51,748 --> 00:14:53,093
Is Darcy around?
Can I...

302
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:54,314
can I speak with her?

303
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:01,424
Darcy and I are having problems.

304
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:03,567
She's moved out.

305
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:06,712
Boy, that's tough.

306
00:15:07,927 --> 00:15:09,930
A lot of people leaving you lately, huh?

307
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,730
I'm-I'm sorry.

308
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:14,420
That's insensitive. I...

309
00:15:15,688 --> 00:15:17,288
I will get my coat.

310
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,952
I'll take you to her, Jimmy.

311
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:22,119
Really?

312
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,933
<i>Hey, how are your, uh,
communication skills?</i>

313
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:39,747
You know, 'cause that's really
what marriage is all about.

314
00:15:40,883 --> 00:15:43,541
<i>Honesty, love.</i>

315
00:15:44,496 --> 00:15:46,302
<i>I'd say it's 50-50.</i>

316
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,625
<i>Sort of like half and half, you know?</i>

317
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:53,761
Well, actually, more like thirds,
if you throw respect in there.

318
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,684
<i>But not equal thirds, 'cause honesty...</i>

319
00:15:56,432 --> 00:15:59,142
<i>is more important than
the love and the respect.</i>

320
00:16:00,987 --> 00:16:01,996
<i>I think.</i>

321
00:16:01,997 --> 00:16:04,754
You got one of the only
salt mines around for 400 miles.

322
00:16:05,324 --> 00:16:07,750
A year without salt, and New Bern
will be a ghost town.

323
00:16:07,931 --> 00:16:09,479
What are we talking about,
a couple hundred pounds?

324
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:11,337
No, we need a lot more than that.

325
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:13,879
- We're going to need food.
- No food to spare.

326
00:16:13,893 --> 00:16:15,441
Won't see another crop till spring.

327
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,325
Spring crop's what I'm talking about.

328
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:19,945
Ten wind turbines for,
let's say...

329
00:16:20,094 --> 00:16:21,364
ten percent of your spring crop.

330
00:16:21,365 --> 00:16:22,783
No, we can't put ourselves
in that position.

331
00:16:22,835 --> 00:16:24,822
Spring crop might not even
get us to next year.

332
00:16:24,972 --> 00:16:27,822
If we lose ten percent, we'll just be
in the same position we are now.

333
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:28,829
Worse.

334
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:30,993
Look, all we're asking you
to do is be reasonable.

335
00:16:31,122 --> 00:16:32,619
Well, we're just trying to survive.

336
00:16:36,645 --> 00:16:39,070
Starve next fall or freeze
this winter...

337
00:16:39,274 --> 00:16:40,539
take your pick.

338
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,994
Vancomycin... good.

339
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:02,956
Start a drip: 250 milligrams IV.

340
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:05,601
I'll do it.

341
00:17:05,678 --> 00:17:07,562
We found four people who are O-negative.

342
00:17:08,104 --> 00:17:10,259
- Fetal heart rate is 169.
- I'll get it off the ultrasound.

343
00:17:10,285 --> 00:17:12,220
Her blood pressure is 130/70.

344
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:15,265
Her respiratory rate is 18,
and her pulse is 88, it's going up.

345
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:16,271
She's losing blood.

346
00:17:16,272 --> 00:17:18,259
Her heart's compensating
by pumping harder.

347
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,781
Start an IV for the blood.

348
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:27,627
What do you see?

349
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:31,575
- Placenta previa.
- What's that?

350
00:17:31,678 --> 00:17:33,588
The placenta is covering
the entire cervix.

351
00:17:33,772 --> 00:17:35,616
There's no way for me to find out
where the bleed is coming from

352
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:36,890
unless we operate.

353
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,057
Well, what are we going to do?

354
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:41,308
Under the best of circumstances,
this is not an operating facility.

355
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,956
- Then we don't have a choice.
- Cannot operate here.

356
00:17:44,004 --> 00:17:45,018
Why?

357
00:17:46,301 --> 00:17:48,882
I have been through this more times
than you could possibly imagine.

358
00:17:48,897 --> 00:17:50,703
We've all been through a lot, all right?
Just tell us...

359
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:53,155
I have seen
hundreds of people die

360
00:17:53,284 --> 00:17:54,987
because of dirty facilities
and infection

361
00:17:55,013 --> 00:17:56,871
and because I didn't have
the proper medicine

362
00:17:56,897 --> 00:17:58,183
or the equipment
that I needed.

363
00:17:58,187 --> 00:17:59,452
I am not doing it again.

364
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:01,309
We are not losing this baby.

365
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:04,148
You can find yourself another butcher.

366
00:18:10,263 --> 00:18:11,553
There's got to be a way.

367
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:15,994
Kenchy. Listen,

368
00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:18,213
we need a sterile operating room,

369
00:18:18,678 --> 00:18:20,149
sterile instruments,

370
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,639
anesthesia, spinal block tray,
caesarian tray.

371
00:18:22,949 --> 00:18:24,961
Have you ever even seen a surgery
performed without

372
00:18:24,962 --> 00:18:25,991
an electrocautery machine?

373
00:18:25,998 --> 00:18:27,902
No, you haven't. Because
this doesn't even taught anymore.

374
00:18:27,927 --> 00:18:30,740
Can't we just use laparotomy
sponges to stop the bleeding?

375
00:18:31,282 --> 00:18:32,831
God, my head is killing me.

376
00:18:33,037 --> 00:18:35,127
We've got several spinal block trays,

377
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:36,469
and we've got anesthesia.

378
00:18:36,534 --> 00:18:39,037
And we can boil
the sheets and the tools.

379
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:41,721
Is it possible?

380
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:46,798
- Remotely.
- Then start.

381
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:50,282
- We need bleach.
- What?

382
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,695
Bleach.
You know? Bleach.

383
00:18:55,118 --> 00:18:57,648
Bonnie, look at my lips.
Bleach !

384
00:18:58,525 --> 00:18:59,686
Learn.

385
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:05,002
- Is that the word for "bleach"?
- No.

386
00:19:05,058 --> 00:19:06,064
"Bitch."

387
00:19:06,632 --> 00:19:09,316
And... "please."

388
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,219
And "sorry."

389
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:42,760
I'm heading out.

390
00:19:44,036 --> 00:19:45,972
If I'm not back, lock up at dark

391
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:47,804
and don't let anyone in.

392
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:51,236
Also, if I'm not around ever

393
00:19:51,365 --> 00:19:54,410
and you need anything,
just talk to Gail Green or Johnston.

394
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:55,951
You can trust them.

395
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,493
I'm going to come with you.

396
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,267
Why?

397
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:07,975
Two against one.

398
00:20:19,672 --> 00:20:20,834
Hey, Bill.

399
00:20:22,969 --> 00:20:24,267
What's wrong?

400
00:20:27,015 --> 00:20:28,914
I just jumped in.

401
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:31,090
It was...

402
00:20:33,728 --> 00:20:35,514
It was just in the moment.

403
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:38,876
You volunteered at the medical center
long before I ever get here.

404
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,567
It's fine.

405
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:43,317
Kenchy just doesn't know you.

406
00:20:43,651 --> 00:20:45,787
Everybody else respects you.

407
00:20:46,638 --> 00:20:49,011
They speak your language.

408
00:20:56,537 --> 00:20:58,923
- Hey, we got a problem.
- What's that?

409
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:02,361
Eddie and Frank are asking
how come you're not making the deal.

410
00:21:02,654 --> 00:21:04,594
Words are gonna start to spread.

411
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,249
As far as they know,
the marines said that

412
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,610
the army corp of engineers would
be here within the month.

413
00:21:08,674 --> 00:21:11,242
What difference does it make if we give
New Bern a part of next year's profit?

414
00:21:11,243 --> 00:21:12,920
They think there's going
to be food by then.

415
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:15,487
You didn't want to tell them it was
a bunch of crap, so now what do we do?

416
00:21:15,488 --> 00:21:16,855
All right,

417
00:21:17,355 --> 00:21:19,700
maybe we should tell the town
that help's not coming.

418
00:21:19,886 --> 00:21:22,622
We just told them that to give 'em
something to get through winter.

419
00:21:22,623 --> 00:21:24,728
Town's already on the edge,
you'll have anarchy.

420
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:26,446
And I'm not leverage
next winter's food,

421
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:27,604
that'd be suicide.

422
00:21:30,297 --> 00:21:31,482
What if we tell New Bern that

423
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:33,479
we'll give them
10% of next year's crop.

424
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,139
We get power now.

425
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:38,640
If next year we don't have
the food to give, we don't give it up.

426
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:42,271
That's how wars get started.

427
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,431
I can't believe Darcy is staying
at the refugee shelter.

428
00:21:50,297 --> 00:21:51,525
Hey, Jim,

429
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,437
let me talk to her a second.

430
00:21:54,288 --> 00:21:55,977
- Sure.
- Thanks.

431
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,929
I asked you to stay away.

432
00:22:05,185 --> 00:22:07,250
Jimmy wanted to ask you
some questions...

433
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,264
about Sarah.

434
00:22:12,822 --> 00:22:14,203
Where are the kids?

435
00:22:14,691 --> 00:22:16,436
They're in the gym, playing.

436
00:22:17,385 --> 00:22:19,604
We need a consistent cover story.

437
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:24,447
What'd you do with her body?

438
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:29,834
I buried her.

439
00:22:31,676 --> 00:22:33,560
So I can tell them that right now,

440
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:34,974
and never see you again.

441
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,482
I could tell him about...

442
00:22:36,483 --> 00:22:38,685
- What did you call it... "the package"?
- Stop it!

443
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:43,763
You understand the story?

444
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:45,876
Family? New Orleans?

445
00:22:46,253 --> 00:22:48,472
And you don't know
anything else about her.

446
00:22:51,582 --> 00:22:52,949
This'll just take a sec.

447
00:22:53,368 --> 00:22:55,685
Yeah, well, I don't want
to talk to you in front of him.

448
00:22:58,364 --> 00:23:00,499
Why don't you give us
a minute, Mr. Hawkins?

449
00:23:03,402 --> 00:23:04,645
I'll be out front...

450
00:23:05,566 --> 00:23:06,947
let you two talk.

451
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,026
You're going to be okay, angel.

452
00:23:21,697 --> 00:23:23,413
Did you ever do
a surgical rotation?

453
00:23:23,414 --> 00:23:24,548
Only in school.

454
00:23:24,597 --> 00:23:26,272
Most of my career was in post-op.

455
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:30,780
I feel obligated to ask you
if you're sober enough to do this.

456
00:23:30,794 --> 00:23:32,399
You can talk me through it.

457
00:23:32,887 --> 00:23:35,023
You will refer to me
as Dr. Dhuwalia, Nurse.

458
00:23:35,024 --> 00:23:36,843
And my sobriety is not the issue.

459
00:23:36,844 --> 00:23:39,955
The people I call "doctor"
don't smell like a brewery.

460
00:23:39,956 --> 00:23:42,482
Respirations are 16.
Pulse rate is 82.

461
00:23:42,483 --> 00:23:44,594
Her blood pressure's down to 100/62.

462
00:23:44,595 --> 00:23:46,144
God help us.

463
00:23:51,188 --> 00:23:52,918
- Is the baby okay?
- I don't know.

464
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,830
Mom said there's a problem.

465
00:23:54,927 --> 00:23:56,727
We were just
collecting firewood.

466
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:58,267
You don't have
to explain it to me.

467
00:23:58,407 --> 00:23:59,593
What about Mom?

468
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,384
Don't worry about that.

469
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:14,309
Shut the door.

470
00:24:18,803 --> 00:24:20,757
We're losing too much blood.
Clamp it off.

471
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:26,927
Get away from the incision!

472
00:24:26,928 --> 00:24:28,755
I need to hear
if the baby's in distress.

473
00:24:29,514 --> 00:24:31,342
Get away from the incision.

474
00:24:31,343 --> 00:24:34,091
You haven't let me get
a pulse from this baby in an hour.

475
00:24:34,092 --> 00:24:36,403
Respirations are 16, pulse is 84.

476
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:39,513
Fetal heart rate is less than
five beats per minute.

477
00:24:39,514 --> 00:24:41,974
You're not close enough to the fetus.
It's not an accurate measurement.

478
00:24:41,975 --> 00:24:44,613
The placenta's grown into
the uterus wall. It's ripping away.

479
00:24:44,781 --> 00:24:46,721
- That's what's causing the bleeding.
- Now I've lost it.

480
00:24:46,722 --> 00:24:48,530
- I can't hear anything.
- What is going on?

481
00:24:48,531 --> 00:24:50,037
The baby's heart beat has stopped.

482
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:52,108
- What do you mean, it's stopped?
- Do something.

483
00:24:54,663 --> 00:24:56,351
That must be
the last of the diesel.

484
00:24:56,352 --> 00:24:57,524
Open the door.

485
00:24:57,942 --> 00:24:59,324
Open the blinds.
I need light.

486
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:01,994
Why aren't you doing
something about the baby?

487
00:25:03,395 --> 00:25:05,530
This hasn't been about
the baby for several hours.

488
00:25:05,531 --> 00:25:07,302
The baby never really had a chance.

489
00:25:07,303 --> 00:25:09,298
- I'm sorry.
- What are you saying?

490
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,896
I am trying to save April.

491
00:25:34,975 --> 00:25:37,041
- What do you want?
- Same thing as before.

492
00:25:37,373 --> 00:25:40,727
- My share of the crop.
- I told you I can't do that. Go home.

493
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,464
I'm only asking for what's mine.

494
00:25:50,288 --> 00:25:51,837
You said there's no law, right?

495
00:25:52,381 --> 00:25:53,874
I'm not trying to cheat anybody.

496
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:55,703
I don't have that much left.

497
00:25:55,704 --> 00:25:57,656
Then give my share
of whatever you got.

498
00:25:58,311 --> 00:25:59,344
Right now.

499
00:26:12,586 --> 00:26:14,372
- What's going on?
- I... I just...

500
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:16,759
need some space right now.

501
00:26:21,636 --> 00:26:22,864
We lost the baby.

502
00:26:27,484 --> 00:26:28,684
Oh, sweetie...

503
00:26:32,662 --> 00:26:34,337
I need to be
with April right now.

504
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,057
What took you so long?

505
00:27:04,034 --> 00:27:06,783
Well after...
talking with Darcy, uh...

506
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,617
a lot of things are starting
to make sense now.

507
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:14,580
You all right, Mr. Hawkins?

508
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,204
I'm fine.

509
00:27:19,954 --> 00:27:21,293
Well, Darcy said...

510
00:27:23,024 --> 00:27:25,885
that Sarah left for New Orleans,
just like you told me.

511
00:27:27,965 --> 00:27:29,891
What? You think I was lying?

512
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,605
I told Darcy she and the kids
can come stay with us.

513
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,881
She doesn't need
to be staying in the shelter.

514
00:27:36,435 --> 00:27:38,162
Thanks, Jimmy.
I appreciate that.

515
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,140
We found a body, Robert.

516
00:27:51,376 --> 00:27:52,622
Out in the woods.

517
00:27:55,488 --> 00:27:57,992
Near Mill Creek.
Broken neck.

518
00:27:58,247 --> 00:27:59,613
Animals got to it.

519
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,249
Michael Connor was on patrol,

520
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,723
said he saw
an African-American woman

521
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,959
driving out that way
a couple nights ago.

522
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:08,758
Perfect description of Sarah Mason.

523
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:10,739
Really?

524
00:28:13,362 --> 00:28:15,036
Think she could do
something like that?

525
00:28:16,323 --> 00:28:17,421
I don't know.

526
00:28:18,692 --> 00:28:20,567
You know,
I'm learning that, uh...

527
00:28:21,103 --> 00:28:23,594
it's hard to figure what
people are capable of, Jimmy.

528
00:28:24,827 --> 00:28:26,541
Well, our John Doe was bald.

529
00:28:27,452 --> 00:28:28,818
Know anyone looks like that?

530
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:40,817
If Sarah comes back...

531
00:28:41,258 --> 00:28:43,401
we'd really, really
like to talk to her.

532
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,789
My guess is...

533
00:28:46,521 --> 00:28:47,860
she's not coming back.

534
00:28:50,686 --> 00:28:52,373
That'd be my guess, too.

535
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,917
New Bern's all made of clay,
can't grow nothing.

536
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:03,770
We need 10% of your spring crop,

537
00:29:03,895 --> 00:29:05,783
and 700 pounds refined salt.

538
00:29:05,784 --> 00:29:07,875
Well, y-you said 500 earlier.

539
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:09,897
- Price went up.
- Why?

540
00:29:10,312 --> 00:29:12,468
Because that's what
power costs in this world.

541
00:29:12,469 --> 00:29:13,687
Oh, now, come on...

542
00:29:14,175 --> 00:29:16,127
We got people freezing
to death in their homes.

543
00:29:16,128 --> 00:29:17,160
Give us a break.

544
00:29:18,863 --> 00:29:20,502
You were at my son's wedding.

545
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,426
I'm sorry for your troubles.

546
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:25,443
But we got our own.

547
00:29:36,571 --> 00:29:38,578
We'll give you the food.
We'll give you the salt.

548
00:29:39,393 --> 00:29:40,477
Everything.

549
00:29:41,828 --> 00:29:44,179
We can have the wind turbines
to you in a couple weeks.

550
00:29:44,644 --> 00:29:46,768
What guarantee do we have
you'll give us our share of the crop?

551
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:48,050
You have our word.

552
00:29:49,423 --> 00:29:51,944
We're going to need ten Jericho men
to help us build them.

553
00:29:52,433 --> 00:29:53,960
We can take them
back with us now.

554
00:29:54,689 --> 00:29:57,228
Is this about manpower
for wind turbines?

555
00:29:57,229 --> 00:30:00,468
Or is it more about making sure
you get our crops come spring?

556
00:30:00,469 --> 00:30:02,104
Human beings as collateral?

557
00:30:02,304 --> 00:30:03,752
I would never do that.

558
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,686
But I am not going
to build these things on credit.

559
00:30:06,687 --> 00:30:08,955
You want them now?
You're going to help make them.

560
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:12,641
Just hold the pressure.

561
00:30:12,642 --> 00:30:14,719
Put pressure right there.
Right there.

562
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,079
Press, harder!

563
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,956
Damn it! I can't see!

564
00:30:17,957 --> 00:30:19,410
I- I'll get another lantern.

565
00:30:19,593 --> 00:30:21,894
You can bring ten lanterns.
Doesn't make any difference.

566
00:30:21,895 --> 00:30:23,864
It's not going to be enough.
I need real light!

567
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:26,285
Blood pressure is down to 66/30.

568
00:30:26,286 --> 00:30:27,382
This is crazy.

569
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:29,580
This is crazy. Close her up.

570
00:30:29,581 --> 00:30:31,296
But we haven't stopped
the bleeding.

571
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:33,896
- What are you doing?
- Give her some peace.

572
00:30:34,298 --> 00:30:35,611
Give her some dignity.

573
00:30:35,612 --> 00:30:37,734
You are not giving up on her.

574
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:38,759
I'm sorry.

575
00:30:39,831 --> 00:30:40,877
Close this up.

576
00:30:50,994 --> 00:30:52,374
Where do you think you're going?

577
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:53,688
You get back inside, right now!

578
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:56,178
- Come on!
- Take it easy.

579
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,652
Take it easy, all right?

580
00:30:58,028 --> 00:30:59,395
Just let me handle this.

581
00:30:59,396 --> 00:31:00,561
Let me handle it.

582
00:31:02,022 --> 00:31:03,067
What are you doing?

583
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:05,359
You want me to say it
in front of him?

584
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,411
Go back inside, all right?

585
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,818
April needs you.

586
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:16,901
To go on operating
is cruel and pointless.

587
00:31:18,455 --> 00:31:20,854
Don't even ask me, Jake.
I'm done with this.

588
00:31:20,934 --> 00:31:22,059
I became a plastic surgeon

589
00:31:22,153 --> 00:31:24,177
so I could have the simple, easy life
that other man face.

590
00:31:24,178 --> 00:31:25,991
- Not in this town.
- I don't care.

591
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,781
I'm not going through this anymore.
It is madness.

592
00:31:28,782 --> 00:31:30,684
And everyone here
can just go to hell?

593
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:35,259
If you stop trying, and I stop,
then they see that.

594
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,309
And this whole thing falls apart.

595
00:31:37,611 --> 00:31:40,263
We're all leaning on each other here,
whether you like it or not.

596
00:31:40,264 --> 00:31:41,265
Promise me

597
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,815
you are not saying
that we're all connected.

598
00:31:42,816 --> 00:31:45,281
This is not some existential,
web-of-life BS.

599
00:31:45,282 --> 00:31:47,399
That is not what I'm hearing,
is it, Jake?

600
00:31:48,445 --> 00:31:50,200
Then tell me
what you want to hear.

601
00:31:52,251 --> 00:31:53,645
'Cause I'll say anything,

602
00:31:53,963 --> 00:31:56,778
if you'll just go back in there
and keep trying.

603
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,042
She's going to die.

604
00:32:10,087 --> 00:32:11,267
I know.

605
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,265
Okay. New gloves.

606
00:32:32,892 --> 00:32:35,025
Let's get this bleeding
stopped, shall we?

607
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:38,173
- Well, we've got more sponges.
- Excellent!

608
00:32:38,243 --> 00:32:40,115
Pack them in others vascular bleeding.

609
00:32:40,202 --> 00:32:41,794
Just give me time to suture.

610
00:33:13,217 --> 00:33:14,774
He's going to need you.

611
00:33:18,412 --> 00:33:19,436
Now.

612
00:33:37,247 --> 00:33:38,519
Hold my hand.

613
00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:44,292
I'm right here.

614
00:33:46,528 --> 00:33:47,990
I'm right next to you.

615
00:33:59,147 --> 00:34:00,951
I like the name Tracy.

616
00:34:10,455 --> 00:34:12,353
Tracy's a beautiful name.

617
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,136
Thank you for not saying anything.

618
00:35:37,288 --> 00:35:39,453
I didn't do it for you,
I did it for Allison.

619
00:35:45,452 --> 00:35:47,427
I need my family to come home.

620
00:35:49,363 --> 00:35:50,560
I, uh...

621
00:35:52,363 --> 00:35:53,597
I need you.

622
00:35:58,018 --> 00:35:59,385
You know, in the last

623
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:02,176
three months,
I remembered all the reasons

624
00:36:02,651 --> 00:36:04,284
why I need you in my life.

625
00:36:04,358 --> 00:36:05,368
So have I.

626
00:36:05,398 --> 00:36:07,486
I've also remembered
why it can never work.

627
00:36:09,176 --> 00:36:13,201
I need truth, Robert, and that's
something you've never given me.

628
00:36:13,273 --> 00:36:16,729
- Everything I do, I do for us.
- Listen.

629
00:36:17,963 --> 00:36:20,906
When you hide a part of yourself,

630
00:36:21,134 --> 00:36:22,976
I don't care what the reason is...

631
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,572
it puts something between us.

632
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:27,908
Please.

633
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,927
My daughter just killed a woman.

634
00:36:32,973 --> 00:36:35,233
I don't have any more trust to give you.

635
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:42,862
So, I got the kids with
Margaret back at the house.

636
00:36:43,906 --> 00:36:45,292
What can I carry?

637
00:36:45,529 --> 00:36:46,555
This.

638
00:36:56,024 --> 00:36:57,239
Hang in there.

639
00:36:58,302 --> 00:36:59,840
I got faith in you guys.

640
00:37:15,552 --> 00:37:16,672
Sorry?

641
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,380
The wind turbine's working.

642
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:39,588
Mrs. Hodges, how are you doing?

643
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:42,437
- Not so hot.
- Let's get you checked out again.

644
00:37:43,006 --> 00:37:44,297
Dr. Dhuwalia.

645
00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:51,452
Mrs. Hodges' cough is worse.
Her temperature is 102.

646
00:37:58,154 --> 00:38:01,059
- Hello, Mrs. Hodges.
- I'm Dr. Dhuwalia.

647
00:38:01,135 --> 00:38:03,319
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

648
00:38:03,904 --> 00:38:08,005
Why don't you go outside
and get a pan of boiling hot water

649
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,657
build a tent with a sheet. We need to
get this lady breathing some moist air.

650
00:38:14,102 --> 00:38:16,571
Take a deep breath.
There we go.

651
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,482
That was incredible!
Did you see the look on his face?

652
00:38:20,558 --> 00:38:22,400
I know, I thought he
was going to have a heart attack,

653
00:38:22,457 --> 00:38:24,473
and we were going to have
to drive him to the medical center.

654
00:38:26,942 --> 00:38:28,727
I think we're going to be okay.

655
00:38:34,001 --> 00:38:35,235
Thanks for coming.

656
00:38:36,887 --> 00:38:38,425
I wanted to be there...

657
00:38:40,286 --> 00:38:41,444
with you.

658
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:52,685
<i>You men are the only ones
who really know what's going on here.</i>

659
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,534
When New Bern gets
their share of the spring crop,

660
00:38:56,669 --> 00:39:00,428
you'll be allowed to return.
I know that sounds like a long time,

661
00:39:01,283 --> 00:39:05,465
but what you are about to do
means this town's survival.

662
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,191
Now you've...

663
00:39:08,817 --> 00:39:12,212
I know your families want some time
to say good-bye. So let's get going.

664
00:39:16,202 --> 00:39:17,911
Promise me something...

665
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:24,313
Promise you won't kill
Mimi while I'm gone.

666
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:28,927
And you'll give her food.

667
00:39:30,252 --> 00:39:31,657
Why do you have to go?

668
00:39:32,243 --> 00:39:37,521
People are going to die if we
don't get these wind turbines...

669
00:39:40,555 --> 00:39:42,150
You're all have.

670
00:39:46,023 --> 00:39:47,504
I'll be back.

671
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:09,912
Take care of Bonnie, okay?

672
00:40:11,389 --> 00:40:13,402
Look, I just want to tell you something.

673
00:40:13,915 --> 00:40:16,516
- And don't freak out, okay?
- I won't.

674
00:40:18,756 --> 00:40:19,967
In this...

675
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,429
crazy world we don't know what's
going to happen tomorrow and...

676
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:27,353
I don't wanna leave
anything unsaid, so...

677
00:40:27,486 --> 00:40:29,885
I'm just going to say it, okay?

678
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:32,096
So here I go...

679
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:34,621
I've loved you since the
first day I saw you at Bailey's.

680
00:40:42,737 --> 00:40:45,225
You said it... you said it first.

681
00:40:47,651 --> 00:40:50,024
No one's ever said
it first to me before.

682
00:40:50,632 --> 00:40:52,775
I don't know what's going
to happen tomorrow, and...

683
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,347
Plus,

684
00:40:56,619 --> 00:40:59,182
I can hold it over you
for the rest of our lives.

685
00:41:08,305 --> 00:41:10,166
I love you, Stanley Richmond.

686
00:41:13,242 --> 00:41:14,742
But I said it first.

687
00:41:29,746 --> 00:41:31,208
It wasn't your fault, Eric.

688
00:41:32,177 --> 00:41:33,544
You don't have to do this.

689
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,122
I can't be here right now.

690
00:41:40,837 --> 00:41:41,900
I can't.

691
00:41:58,311 --> 00:41:59,830
Take care, son.

692
00:42:11,967 --> 00:42:13,125
Be strong.

693
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:34,311
I'm...

694
00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:36,609
I'm sorry, Mom.

695
00:42:39,248 --> 00:42:40,881
We'll take care of Mary.

696
00:42:48,548 --> 00:42:50,105
All right, let's move out.

697
00:43:10,176 --> 00:43:11,733
My dad told me what's happening.

698
00:43:12,888 --> 00:43:16,078
First you're helping us, and now this...
What the hell's going on?

699
00:43:16,153 --> 00:43:18,403
They're going to be fine.
I'm going to look after them.

00:43:18,441 --> 00:43:20,681
- You have to trust me on this.

701
00:43:21,758 --> 00:43:23,353
This isn't me.

702
00:43:23,487 --> 00:43:24,520
Where's Heather?

703
00:43:24,589 --> 00:43:27,684
She's fine. I told her we were making
the trip. She didn't want to come.

704
00:43:28,253 --> 00:43:29,259
Truth.

705
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:34,838
If anything happens to any of them,
you're the first one I come for.

706
00:43:38,388 --> 00:43:39,471
I know.
