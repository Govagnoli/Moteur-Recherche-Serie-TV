<i>Previously on </i>Jericho

2
00:00:03,167 --> 00:00:04,544
Oh, my God... Ted !

3
00:00:04,684 --> 00:00:06,199
We grew up together over in New Bern.

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,587
- You just going to leave?
- It won't be for very long.

5
00:00:09,401 --> 00:00:11,059
Johnston, you SOB.

6
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:12,863
How the hell did you lose an election?

7
00:00:12,963 --> 00:00:15,619
No. The question is, how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?

8
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:17,087
They get tired of you being sheriff?

9
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:18,604
<i>Can we buy some more of these things?

10
00:00:18,628 --> 00:00:20,510
Ten wind turbines for, let's say...

11
00:00:20,807 --> 00:00:21,875
ten percent of your spring crop.

12
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:23,761
Okay, we'll give you the food.

13
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:26,226
We're going to need ten Jericho men
to help us build them.

14
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:27,963
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.

15
00:00:28,088 --> 00:00:30,984
<i>You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china.

16
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,540
It's a full inventory of Jericho.

17
00:00:33,688 --> 00:00:35,519
They slid it up like they own it.

18
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:37,023
They're making mortar rounds.

19
00:00:37,226 --> 00:00:38,611
They're getting ready for war.

20
00:00:38,752 --> 00:00:39,774
Hold it!

21
00:00:40,653 --> 00:00:43,218
We wanted to break the machine.
Stop the factory.

22
00:00:43,357 --> 00:00:44,358
Where's Heather?

23
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:46,063
She's dead, Jake.

24
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:49,161
Everybody go!

25
00:00:49,662 --> 00:00:51,680
<i>Jericho is about to be invaded.

26
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,677
<i>We'll do this day and night
for as long as it takes.

27
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:58,900
Most of you have no idea of
what's coming.

28
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:01,174
This isn't a fight about land.

29
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:04,262
This is a fight for our very existence.

30
00:01:26,407 --> 00:01:28,852
I know this has great artistic merit,
but...

31
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:30,945
i'm taking these shoes off
in ten minutes.

32
00:01:30,998 --> 00:01:32,478
So, if you don't want
to have to hide my toes...

33
00:01:32,532 --> 00:01:34,156
Oh, Gail, make yourself comfortable.

34
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:36,581
We can't really do this
without the best man anyway.

35
00:01:36,753 --> 00:01:37,911
Where is Jake?

36
00:01:39,605 --> 00:01:40,606
I don't see him.

37
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,765
Grandpa seems to be missing, too.

38
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:45,143
Take a wild guess where they are.

39
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,911
Right.

40
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,352
Oh, Beth.
It's so nice to see you, dear.

41
00:02:10,793 --> 00:02:11,875
I need your help.

42
00:02:11,975 --> 00:02:14,278
We need to go over
to the medical center.

43
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,571
- Is everyone in there?
- Yeah. We're just waiting for you.

44
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:32,536
How is it going out there?

45
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:34,273
They took Talbot's farm.

46
00:02:34,476 --> 00:02:35,478
How many men?

47
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,950
I'd say 60... 70.

48
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:40,175
That's probably just
an advance team.

49
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,978
I would imagine they got more than that
up the road in reserve.

50
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:46,105
Constantino has us outnumbered
and outgunned.

51
00:02:46,488 --> 00:02:49,207
If we split our force, and try
to defend each one of these farms,

52
00:02:49,307 --> 00:02:50,611
he's goino toverwhelm us.

53
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:52,113
So what are you saying?

54
00:02:52,334 --> 00:02:53,502
I'm saying we don't split up.

55
00:02:53,602 --> 00:02:56,009
We choose a place to stand together,

56
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,570
deliver a good, hard counterpunch.
Let them know that,

57
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,402
if they intend to take from us,
it's going to cost them dearly.

58
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:02,778
How?

59
00:03:02,888 --> 00:03:04,681
Well, right here.
Stanley Richmond's farm.

60
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:06,870
It's the last place
before this road divides,

61
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,255
and they start taking ground
faster than we can keep up.

62
00:03:09,317 --> 00:03:11,758
Plus which it's the highest point
in the whole area.

63
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:15,866
There's where we make our stand.

64
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:24,133
Deputy Perkins just radioed back.

65
00:03:24,234 --> 00:03:25,786
He told the farm is secured.

66
00:03:27,638 --> 00:03:29,309
Let's go get the rest of them.

67
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:33,011
Let's go!

68
00:04:06,307 --> 00:04:07,434
This one's alive.

<i>6 YEARS AGO

74
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:36,343
- Grandpa, you're drunk.
- Yeah!

75
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:39,051
Thank you, darling

76
00:04:39,151 --> 00:04:40,525
Keep 'em coming.

77
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:44,262
Gail's going to get so mad at you
for getting her boy drunk.

78
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:46,870
I've got Gail wrapped
around my little finger.

79
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:50,086
Says the guy who taught me
to fly his crop duster when I was 13,

80
00:04:50,186 --> 00:04:52,480
then told Mom I was lying
when I mentioned it.

81
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,319
I was so jealous.
My mom knew that you let him fly,

82
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:57,943
and she wouldn't let me go
anywhere near you.

83
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,507
You see, Jake would...

84
00:04:59,617 --> 00:05:02,359
Jake would come over and tell me
all the stories you told him.

85
00:05:02,546 --> 00:05:03,548
I loved...

86
00:05:03,657 --> 00:05:05,535
I loved the one about the peanuts.

87
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:09,579
What the hell are you talking about?

88
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:13,740
The peanuts in World War II.

89
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:16,912
He means the "Nuts" story, Grandpa.

90
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:19,345
Not peanuts.
There were no peanuts involved.

91
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:21,958
So what's the story?
Tell me the story, somebody.

92
00:05:22,058 --> 00:05:23,405
What? It's his story.

93
00:05:23,505 --> 00:05:24,513
All right.

94
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:29,246
World War II.
The winter of 1944.

95
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:32,535
The Nazis penetrated the Allied lines,

96
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,349
and surrounded...

97
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:38,089
a division of Americans
in a little town called Bastogne,

98
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:42,649
freezing, starving and running out
of ammunition, but they knew...

99
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,730
that they had to hold that ground.

100
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,326
Just before Christmas,

101
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:49,139
the Nazis sent a note

102
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:50,981
to the American commander

103
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:53,200
telling him that he could

104
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,320
surrender and save the rt of his men,

105
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,161
or they could stay and fight.

106
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:59,054
The American commander

107
00:05:59,187 --> 00:06:02,598
sent a one-word reply
to the Wehrmacht commander,

108
00:06:03,877 --> 00:06:05,801
and it said...
- ... "Nuts."

109
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,344
Why did he say, "Nuts"?

110
00:06:09,444 --> 00:06:11,091
It means, "Go to hell!"

111
00:06:11,191 --> 00:06:12,693
Why didn't he just say, "Go to hell"?

112
00:06:12,793 --> 00:06:14,097
Because he said, "Nuts. "

113
00:06:17,617 --> 00:06:20,136
Gail, my sweetheart,
you look beautiful.

114
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:21,396
Save it, Dal.

115
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:24,149
Was it your idea
to get my son drunk tonight?

116
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:31,205
Right. Okay.
Everybody back to the reception.

117
00:06:31,573 --> 00:06:33,638
- Come on.
- But I'm hammered.

118
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:35,844
And I want to talk to you.

119
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,394
Have a cup of coffee, Stanley.

120
00:06:39,795 --> 00:06:40,796
Here.

121
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:43,534
Well, what's this?

122
00:06:44,097 --> 00:06:46,644
As your brother's best man,
you are required to give a toast,

123
00:06:46,744 --> 00:06:48,713
so I wrote down a few thoughts,

124
00:06:48,813 --> 00:06:50,985
some things that
you might want to say.

125
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:53,355
You think I was going to wing it?

126
00:06:57,099 --> 00:06:59,368
Let's go take some pictures, okay?

127
00:07:06,013 --> 00:07:07,077
What's going on?

128
00:07:13,785 --> 00:07:16,945
Mr. Green, I have access
to a keyhole military satellite

129
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:20,927
that I can use to track New Bern's
movements in the field today.

130
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:22,864
- Beg pardon?
- It's real.

131
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:24,259
The one restriction...

132
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:27,881
is that no one can know
where you're getting this information.

133
00:07:28,007 --> 00:07:31,527
Tell them I'm... scouting in the field,
tell them what you want...

134
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:33,783
but the satellite must remain a secret.

135
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:38,133
Sounds good.

136
00:07:38,832 --> 00:07:40,558
- That's it?
- What do you want me to say?

137
00:07:40,675 --> 00:07:43,082
I get it. Man has a satellite.
Doesn't want anyone to know.

138
00:07:43,182 --> 00:07:45,056
- But...
- I am about to go to war,

139
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:47,890
with New Bern, Kansas,
the home of the nearest Costco.

140
00:07:48,086 --> 00:07:50,746
Today is already just about
as weird as I can handle.

141
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,772
I'm not asking any more questions.

142
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:58,441
Mom, Dad,

143
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:01,042
there's a chance we may have
to leave here today,

144
00:08:02,074 --> 00:08:04,468
and we might not be able
to make it back, so...

145
00:08:06,095 --> 00:08:07,159
I just wanted to...

146
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,541
We just...

147
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:11,403
wanted to pay our respects.

148
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:15,079
Remember I told you about that witch,
from the IRS?

149
00:08:15,377 --> 00:08:16,425
The one that wanted

150
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:18,995
to take everything
you've ever worked for?

151
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:20,293
Mom, Dad...

152
00:08:21,248 --> 00:08:22,546
this is Mimi.

153
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,322
Hello.

154
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:32,934
It's nice to finally meet you.

155
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,615
I really love your son.

156
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:41,025
And, of course,
Bonnie is...

157
00:08:41,182 --> 00:08:42,574
she's just wonderful.

158
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:46,311
And I've really enjoyed
living with them and...

159
00:08:46,452 --> 00:08:48,548
- Oh, great.
- What?

160
00:08:49,182 --> 00:08:51,278
I didn't say we were living together.

161
00:08:52,686 --> 00:08:53,875
We're not married.

162
00:08:56,742 --> 00:09:00,153
I'm so sorry.
I certainly... I...

163
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:05,003
Is everything a joke to you?

164
00:09:08,545 --> 00:09:11,439
I figure one day we're going
to be buried here ourselves,

165
00:09:11,814 --> 00:09:12,816
and I...

166
00:09:13,864 --> 00:09:15,256
think it would be nice if...

167
00:09:15,851 --> 00:09:18,296
our kids came and,
and joked around with us.

168
00:09:21,957 --> 00:09:24,288
I hope that's not
for a really long time.

169
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,950
How we doing?

170
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,934
We've got about 200 men.
That includes Dale's crew.

171
00:09:47,457 --> 00:09:48,865
We got more coming, right?

172
00:09:48,975 --> 00:09:52,182
They're trickling in. It's taking
a lot longer than we thought.

173
00:09:53,746 --> 00:09:55,452
Saying good-bye to their families.

174
00:09:56,622 --> 00:09:58,632
Get on down to the pass.
Get everybody organized.

175
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,381
We don't have a whole lot of time
before their advance unit hits.

176
00:10:01,624 --> 00:10:03,454
- Not you.
- Why not?

177
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:06,263
Because these people
elected you their leader.

178
00:10:06,363 --> 00:10:08,175
We protect you at all costs.

179
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,984
And, besides, in a few minutes,
I'm going to need your help.

180
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:12,112
Help with what?

181
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:14,777
Arming our tank.

182
00:10:22,944 --> 00:10:26,057
Our daughter is out there carrying
a rifle and... I'm in here.

183
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,747
Sam needs you here.

184
00:10:29,483 --> 00:10:30,766
You know, Allie's safe.

185
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:32,872
She's been assigned to Town Hall,

186
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:35,002
and the fighting is miles from there.

187
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,499
Right now, there really isn't
anything else you can be doing.

188
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,171
Here we go.

189
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,257
<i>Jake, you are about
to have company.

190
00:10:52,357 --> 00:10:53,386
Already?

191
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:55,765
<i>New Bern is on its way.
There are...

192
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:57,940
<i>70, maybe... 80 men.

193
00:10:58,253 --> 00:10:59,778
Is that tank there yet?

194
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:03,020
They're trying to load it
with that mortar round right now.

195
00:11:04,616 --> 00:11:06,228
I think you're gonna need it.

196
00:11:07,894 --> 00:11:10,334
All right, let's get ready!
They're coming!

197
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:12,228
Get some ammo down here!

198
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:17,969
What is it?

199
00:11:24,603 --> 00:11:25,807
I'm being tracked.

200
00:11:26,938 --> 00:11:28,424
Tracked?
What do you mean?

201
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:31,710
Someone is trying to trace my location
through the satellite.

202
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,432
- Well, can they?
- If they have time, yes.

203
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:37,381
Do you know who it is?

204
00:11:38,492 --> 00:11:40,448
My guess is, it's... Valente.

205
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:47,049
What him?
From... Homeland Security?

206
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:49,020
I don't know who he's working for now,

207
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,242
but he told Sarah
to get the bomb any way she could

208
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:53,013
and to eliminate all witnesses.

209
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,069
All the witnesses.

210
00:11:57,663 --> 00:11:59,400
- Shut it down.
- No, I can't.

211
00:11:59,603 --> 00:12:03,554
We just have to make sure we disconnect
the feed before he finishes the trace.

212
00:13:53,602 --> 00:13:54,604
I don't get it.

213
00:13:54,893 --> 00:13:57,490
- Why are they just standing there?
- I don't know.

214
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,978
Do we fire the first shot?

215
00:14:09,758 --> 00:14:10,837
New Bern's here.

216
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:13,403
Get into position.

217
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:44,326
We're gonna need that tank.

218
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:07,193
Having a good time?

219
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:11,722
By the way, I think I saw April
making out with Shep Cale.

220
00:15:11,822 --> 00:15:12,972
All right, all right.

221
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,764
You need to stop drinking.

222
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,160
Listen.

223
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:21,691
Read this.
It's a speech.

224
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,461
Figure you should have something ready,
so you don't embarrass yourself.

225
00:15:24,577 --> 00:15:27,581
You mean so I don't embarrass you,
because you don't have to worry.

226
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:30,337
Is that how you spell
"venereal disease"?

227
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,401
This day is important to me, okay?

228
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:34,306
Just because your life's a big joke

229
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:36,452
doesn't mean you have
to treat mine that way.

230
00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:38,127
Why is my life a joke?

231
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:40,116
- Just read the speech.
- No, seriously, Eric,

232
00:15:40,216 --> 00:15:43,236
why is my life a joke?
- I'm not getting into this right now.

233
00:15:45,146 --> 00:15:46,150
All right.

234
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:51,361
You think people don't wonder
what you've been doing?

235
00:15:51,496 --> 00:15:54,024
You spend all that time
in flight school getting your license.

236
00:15:54,178 --> 00:15:55,837
Instead of using it,
you come back here,

237
00:15:55,953 --> 00:15:58,114
hanging out like it's the summer
after high school.

238
00:15:58,335 --> 00:16:00,746
Hauling stuff for Emily's dad.

239
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,968
If I'm such a joke,
then why'd you want me as your best man?

240
00:16:12,177 --> 00:16:13,691
You didn't want me, did you?

241
00:16:14,036 --> 00:16:15,888
No, not really.

242
00:16:31,627 --> 00:16:33,087
Where's that tank?

243
00:16:33,187 --> 00:16:35,232
We're not going to last long
against those trucks.

244
00:16:35,332 --> 00:16:36,641
We have to hold out.

245
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,463
Damn it!

246
00:16:49,344 --> 00:16:52,149
- Got to keep drawing their fire,
all right?  - Got It.

247
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:57,842
Give me another mag.

248
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:01,032
Where are you going?

249
00:17:01,132 --> 00:17:03,637
We'll never get a clean shot from here.
I need to get up that hill...

250
00:17:03,737 --> 00:17:04,888
and shot on the gunner.

251
00:17:05,602 --> 00:17:07,125
- I got your back.
- All right.

252
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:08,782
Cover him!

253
00:17:34,265 --> 00:17:36,927
Why eliminate witnesses?

254
00:17:38,046 --> 00:17:40,400
I mean, whoever's tracking you,
they either...

255
00:17:40,612 --> 00:17:42,889
want to use the bomb
for themselves or...

256
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:45,763
they want to keep you
from using it, but...

257
00:17:45,922 --> 00:17:48,527
either way,
what difference do witnesses make?

258
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,406
The bombs have fingerprints,
don't they? Something that...

259
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,126
make them traceable.
I remember reading that.

260
00:18:20,074 --> 00:18:21,945
It's the uranium.
It has...

261
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,401
It has a specific signature.

262
00:18:27,192 --> 00:18:29,892
It places the origin of the device
where it was made.

263
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:33,060
So there were dozens of these things
used in the attacks, right?

264
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:35,375
And now you have the last one.

265
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:41,123
I don't think these people are looking
at this thing as a weapon.

266
00:18:41,223 --> 00:18:42,635
It's more than that.
It's...

267
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,429
Evidence.

268
00:18:49,725 --> 00:18:52,330
It's the smoking gun
behind the greatest crime

269
00:18:52,484 --> 00:18:54,027
in the history of the world.

270
00:18:56,146 --> 00:18:57,202
The bomb...

271
00:18:57,824 --> 00:18:59,750
it could expose the people...

272
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,104
who were responsible for the attacks.

273
00:19:02,964 --> 00:19:04,574
That's why they need it back.

274
00:20:21,895 --> 00:20:23,128
Did u see what I just did?

275
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:24,845
Holy crap.
That was...

276
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,562
<i>Holy crap!

277
00:20:27,974 --> 00:20:29,745
All right, that bought us some time.

278
00:20:30,086 --> 00:20:32,302
But they'll be back,
and there'll be more of them.

279
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:34,112
And it won't be near as easy
next time.

280
00:20:34,212 --> 00:20:36,372
Easy?
You thought that was easy?

281
00:20:39,517 --> 00:20:40,520
Dad?

282
00:20:41,234 --> 00:20:42,237
What's wrong?

283
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,247
Clear the table!
Clear it!

284
00:20:53,363 --> 00:20:55,034
- Clear it!
- I'm gonna go get Kenchy.

285
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:57,008
- Get my mom!
- We'll need towels.

286
00:20:57,163 --> 00:20:59,466
And some antiseptic,
and some alcohol.

287
00:20:59,613 --> 00:21:01,407
- We need alcohol.
- Get a towel!

288
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:03,075
Get me some alcohol!

289
00:21:06,035 --> 00:21:08,948
Here we go.
Give me that, come on!

290
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:10,916
Okay, all right.

291
00:21:13,135 --> 00:21:14,177
Keep the pressure on.

292
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,202
What?
Keep it on! Keep the pressure.

293
00:21:16,685 --> 00:21:17,842
<i>Jake, come in.

294
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:21,915
Nice work out there.

295
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,749
<i>Tell your father that
they're coming back around.

296
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,589
He's been shot.

297
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:31,563
I'm sorry.

298
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,697
You know what to do, right?

299
00:21:38,827 --> 00:21:40,070
<i>Keep pressure on the wound,

300
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,346
<i>and there should be some morphine
syrettes in the... supplies I gave you.

301
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,795
Yeah, we've got it.

302
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,030
Listen, Jake.

303
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,403
<i>People are gonna be
looking to you now.

304
00:21:48,814 --> 00:21:49,975
<i>You know what I mean?

305
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,210
Okay, the guys will be back.

306
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:56,274
They retreated to Talbot's farm.

307
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,925
<i>My guess is,
they're waiting for reinforcements,

308
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:01,271
<i>so you should have a little time
to regroup out there.

309
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:02,686
<i>Just keep the radio close,

310
00:22:02,786 --> 00:22:04,113
and I'll update you.

311
00:22:05,003 --> 00:22:06,006
Out.

312
00:22:07,748 --> 00:22:08,751
Out.

313
00:22:20,749 --> 00:22:22,756
Please, I need to talk
whoever's in charge.

314
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:23,871
Right over there.

315
00:22:30,947 --> 00:22:32,452
Excuse me, sir?

316
00:22:33,494 --> 00:22:34,555
Colonel Hoffman.

317
00:22:34,883 --> 00:22:37,676
You don't have to call me sir,
unless you plan to enlist.

318
00:22:37,776 --> 00:22:40,382
There's a city called New Bern.
It has a munitions factory.

319
00:22:40,562 --> 00:22:43,673
It's planning to overrun the town
of Jericho. People are gonna get killed.

320
00:22:43,773 --> 00:22:45,702
They tried to kill me,
but I got away.

321
00:22:45,972 --> 00:22:48,060
- You've got to help these people.
- Where is this?

322
00:22:48,195 --> 00:22:50,298
Kansas, not far from
the Colorado border.

323
00:22:52,481 --> 00:22:55,370
I wish I could help. My orders are
to secure the roads in this area.

324
00:22:55,543 --> 00:22:57,010
- But, sir...
- I don't get to make these decisions.

325
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,660
I'm just a government employee.

326
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:01,707
Which government?

327
00:23:05,591 --> 00:23:06,980
United States.

328
00:23:08,562 --> 00:23:10,223
Are you all right, ma'am?

329
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:13,070
We heard there were six different people
claiming the presidency.

330
00:23:13,205 --> 00:23:16,146
There were. In fact, there are still
a couple of holdouts...

331
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:18,607
Texas, a bloc in the East.

332
00:23:18,762 --> 00:23:21,588
The new federal government's
been restored in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

333
00:23:21,742 --> 00:23:23,107
Colonel, this is an emergency.

334
00:23:23,215 --> 00:23:25,679
You have to go to Jericho. The fighting
could be happening right now.

335
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:26,933
I am very sorry, ma'am.

336
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:29,646
Casper, you see she gets back
to the medical unit.

337
00:23:29,762 --> 00:23:30,765
Come on, ma'am.

338
00:23:40,313 --> 00:23:41,509
Get 'em out.

339
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:45,367
Get 'em out.

340
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:51,097
Clear everyone out.

341
00:24:01,168 --> 00:24:02,459
You listen...

342
00:24:05,338 --> 00:24:09,345
This place,
is where you survive.

343
00:24:10,648 --> 00:24:13,561
You make a stand here,
you hear?

344
00:24:14,873 --> 00:24:15,876
We will.

345
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,133
I'm sorry you have to see this.

346
00:24:26,495 --> 00:24:27,996
You've been through enough.

347
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,272
Dad...
Dad, stop.

348
00:24:30,581 --> 00:24:33,243
You're stronger than you think
you are, though.

349
00:24:33,397 --> 00:24:34,804
Always have been.

350
00:24:38,531 --> 00:24:40,109
I love you, son.

351
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:55,093
I guess I zigged when I should've
zagged out there, huh?

352
00:25:02,048 --> 00:25:04,247
I sure wish your mother was here.

353
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:10,110
She's coming.

354
00:25:11,151 --> 00:25:12,405
She'll be here.

355
00:25:13,524 --> 00:25:15,396
Tell your mother I love her.

356
00:25:18,688 --> 00:25:21,685
I was... hard on you.

357
00:25:24,888 --> 00:25:28,360
I pushed you... away.

358
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:36,277
I'm glad you... came... home.

359
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:45,086
I'm proud of you.

360
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:22,411
The big toast.

361
00:27:25,064 --> 00:27:26,837
Before I start,
is there anyone who...

362
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,496
hasn't written me a speech?

363
00:27:31,378 --> 00:27:33,784
It really makes me wonder
how screwed up you think I am

364
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,524
that I can't be trusted
to say a few things...

365
00:27:36,683 --> 00:27:37,821
about my brother.

366
00:27:41,684 --> 00:27:42,936
The thing is...

367
00:27:46,794 --> 00:27:48,531
these are all pretty lame.

368
00:27:49,555 --> 00:27:52,343
Not one of them mentions
my brother's musical theater phase

369
00:27:52,443 --> 00:27:54,142
when we all thought he was gay.

370
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,301
Seriously.

371
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:59,101
You have not heard disturbing
until you've heard him singing

372
00:27:59,201 --> 00:28:02,045
"One Hand, One Heart"
in the shower every morning.

373
00:28:21,144 --> 00:28:22,630
I tease my brother a lot,
but...

374
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,884
the truth is...

375
00:28:26,064 --> 00:28:27,979
the truth is I'm very proud of him.

376
00:28:29,937 --> 00:28:30,945
I'm...

377
00:28:32,154 --> 00:28:34,649
I'm proud of how kind he is...

378
00:28:37,157 --> 00:28:39,665
I'm proud of how giving he is,

379
00:28:40,956 --> 00:28:41,961
and...

380
00:28:43,523 --> 00:28:44,990
he's a very lucky man.

381
00:28:46,956 --> 00:28:47,970
Really.

382
00:29:06,831 --> 00:29:08,239
My father's dead.

383
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,676
We'll get through.

384
00:29:50,794 --> 00:29:52,010
Get Gray back to town.

385
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:53,669
What?
Wait a minute...

386
00:29:53,785 --> 00:29:56,073
Come tomorrow,
what's left of us will need a leader.

387
00:29:56,173 --> 00:29:58,692
I think we've lost enough
in that department for one day.

388
00:29:58,981 --> 00:30:00,650
We're gonna need
every set of hands we can get.

389
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:03,612
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're too important now, Gray.

390
00:30:04,461 --> 00:30:06,448
It's not negotiable.
Get him an escort.

391
00:30:06,862 --> 00:30:08,573
And start getting everyone
into position.

392
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:10,972
Who knows when
they're gonna come back again?

393
00:32:23,725 --> 00:32:24,730
Go ahead.

394
00:32:24,847 --> 00:32:26,403
<i>So they got their reinforcements.

395
00:32:26,503 --> 00:32:27,932
<i>It's a couple hundred men.

396
00:32:28,338 --> 00:32:30,902
<i>And another six of those
deuce and a halfs.

397
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:33,742
<i>They're mobilizing now,
so I say you got about 15,

398
00:32:33,842 --> 00:32:36,067
<i>maybe 20 minutes
before they're on you.

399
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:41,518
You get back here as soon as you can.
All right?

400
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,392
Say, what do you know about
a set of train tracks

401
00:32:43,492 --> 00:32:44,852
running alongside the river?

402
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,541
Why?
What do you see?

403
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:49,334
<i>Hawkins, what's on the tracks?

404
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,864
I don't know. I can't see.

405
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,012
- Hang on.
- Robert, disconnect it.

406
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:57,484
Jake, you got a very large train
coming from New Bern,

407
00:32:57,584 --> 00:32:59,099
<i>and they've got three cargo cars.

408
00:32:59,292 --> 00:33:00,295
<i>What's in them?

409
00:33:01,577 --> 00:33:03,532
I think it's men,
and there's hundreds of them.

410
00:33:03,632 --> 00:33:05,627
It's a whole set of reinforcement...

411
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:10,311
Hawkins, what's going on?
Talk to me.

412
00:33:11,796 --> 00:33:12,954
<i>I'm on my way.

413
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:45,759
I've got to go.

414
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:47,380
Wait.

415
00:33:47,554 --> 00:33:49,094
Look, they only had a few seconds.

416
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,512
It wasn't enough time
to get an exact location.

417
00:33:51,683 --> 00:33:54,473
- We're fine for a little while.
- Where are you going?

418
00:33:55,843 --> 00:33:57,348
I have to stop a train.

419
00:34:00,746 --> 00:34:03,342
I-80 is secured
from Cheyenne to Grand Island.

420
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:07,004
We now control the area
between Kearney and Hastings.

421
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:09,770
I-70 is turning out to be a challenge.

422
00:34:10,183 --> 00:34:13,716
There are organized road gangs
controlling much of the interstate.

423
00:34:13,876 --> 00:34:16,529
I've also been told by a patient
in our medical unit

424
00:34:16,664 --> 00:34:20,067
to expect a significant skirmish
between two towns

425
00:34:20,395 --> 00:34:23,977
in northwest Kansas:
New Bern and Jericho.

426
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,153
<i>What is the location of those towns?

427
00:34:28,253 --> 00:34:30,334
CZ-12, Quadrant Four.

428
00:34:30,434 --> 00:34:34,147
<i>We've tracked the terror suspect
to within 200 miles of that area.

429
00:34:34,397 --> 00:34:36,893
<i>Capture of this suspect
is a top priority

430
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:39,065
<i>for President Tomarchio
and the administration.

431
00:34:39,165 --> 00:34:40,222
<i>Do you understand?

432
00:34:40,813 --> 00:34:43,432
- Should I re-prioritize, sir?
- <i>Immediately.

433
00:34:43,613 --> 00:34:46,076
Go to Jericho and crush the skirmish.

434
00:34:46,404 --> 00:34:47,875
Once the area's clear,

435
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,310
we will begin our search
for the terrorist.

436
00:35:06,929 --> 00:35:08,651
I'm gonna ask Mimi to marry me.

437
00:35:09,535 --> 00:35:10,539
Yeah?

438
00:35:11,184 --> 00:35:12,966
Yeah. She can't cook,

439
00:35:13,081 --> 00:35:14,828
she's never seen nine innings
of baseball in her life,

440
00:35:14,928 --> 00:35:16,165
she hates my clothes...

441
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:17,604
but I love her.

442
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,286
And I'm happy.

443
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,262
Jake, I don't want to die today.

444
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:34,886
You're gonna make it out of here.

445
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,133
That I promise.

446
00:35:50,827 --> 00:35:53,930
Constantino and those trucks
are right on your doorstep.

447
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,155
You don't have much time.

448
00:35:55,255 --> 00:35:56,338
What about that train?

449
00:35:56,438 --> 00:35:58,095
20 minutes, give or take.

450
00:35:59,578 --> 00:36:02,026
Tell me you have a plan,
a really good one.

451
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:07,399
I need to borrow your tank.

452
00:36:12,566 --> 00:36:14,785
It won't fire.
I told you that, right?

453
00:36:15,018 --> 00:36:16,885
There's not a single
round of ammo in it.

454
00:36:17,161 --> 00:36:19,223
I'm not planning on shooting anything.

455
00:36:19,581 --> 00:36:21,087
The throttle's there on your left.

456
00:36:21,187 --> 00:36:22,889
And to steer, you're just gonna...

457
00:36:23,545 --> 00:36:25,274
Hey. This is not my first time.

458
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:38,313
Good luck out there.

459
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:43,928
You, too.

460
00:36:55,331 --> 00:36:56,685
Any minute now, huh?

461
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,399
I'm...

462
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,507
You know, he's here...

463
00:37:18,066 --> 00:37:19,089
watching.

464
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,597
You know that, right?

465
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,224
They still doing
the bunny hop in there?

466
00:37:38,272 --> 00:37:39,745
I think it's the Macarena.

467
00:37:41,463 --> 00:37:42,582
The what?

468
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,804
Yeah, they're still doing the bunny hop.

469
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,418
Quite a speech you made in there.

470
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,513
I had no idea you were
such a sentimental fool.

471
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:01,124
Mom wrote it.
You think?

472
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,206
Listen, I know that you and Eric
aren't close and...

473
00:38:13,871 --> 00:38:17,625
maybe you didn't feel like standing up
in front of a bunch of people and...

474
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,163
acting like you were.

475
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,267
Sometimes doing what you feel like doing

476
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:28,269
and doing what needs to be done
are two different things.

477
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,396
You don't have to worry about me, Dad.
I'm fine.

478
00:38:33,388 --> 00:38:36,964
I somehow get the feeling
my worrying days are far from over.

479
00:38:40,049 --> 00:38:41,725
But they will be one day.

480
00:38:43,258 --> 00:38:47,135
One day, I know you're gonna become
the man I know you can be,

481
00:38:47,881 --> 00:38:49,427
the man you were born to be.

482
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,419
My God, that day's gonna be
something to see.

483
00:39:00,811 --> 00:39:02,116
Come on, Johnston.

484
00:39:02,302 --> 00:39:04,395
This scotch ain't gonna drink itself.

485
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,178
Me and the old man are gonna
head down to the lake

486
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:12,370
and share some 30-year-old single malt.
You want to come?

487
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,345
Yeah. I'm just gonna...

488
00:39:17,878 --> 00:39:19,595
wait for Emily, say good night.

489
00:39:20,514 --> 00:39:21,536
I'll...

490
00:39:22,192 --> 00:39:23,215
meet you there.

491
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:25,772
I'll save you a place.

492
00:39:30,474 --> 00:39:33,087
- Where's he going?
- Waiting for Emily, say good night.

493
00:39:34,317 --> 00:39:36,226
That's the last we'll see
of him tonight.

494
00:39:36,326 --> 00:39:37,326
Dad...

495
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:39,816
If I had a girl that looked like that,

496
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:41,440
I wouldn't keep her waiting.

497
00:39:42,441 --> 00:39:43,715
You hear that, boy?

498
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,112
I'm gonna take that girl
away from you.

499
00:39:46,883 --> 00:39:48,276
You talk a good game.

500
00:39:48,376 --> 00:39:50,507
You better watch out
for yourself, too.

501
00:39:50,607 --> 00:39:52,186
Your wife is crazy about me.

502
00:39:52,286 --> 00:39:55,733
Oh, my wife wants to take a hickory
switch to you three times a day.

503
00:39:58,082 --> 00:39:59,246
It's Constantino.

504
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:09,226
I'm here.

505
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:11,139
<i>My scouts just informed me.

506
00:40:11,998 --> 00:40:13,906
<i>I am sorry about your father.

507
00:40:17,732 --> 00:40:20,375
You're outmanned,
and you're outgunned.

508
00:40:20,731 --> 00:40:23,556
There's too many of us and
we are too desperate to give up.

509
00:40:23,656 --> 00:40:24,989
You cannot win this.

510
00:40:26,267 --> 00:40:28,274
I'm giving you one last chance.

511
00:40:29,411 --> 00:40:30,278
<i>Walk away,
put your guns down...

512
00:40:30,279 --> 00:40:31,571
Walk away,
put your guns down...

513
00:40:31,706 --> 00:40:32,928
and return to town,

514
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:34,960
and no one else will be harmed.

515
00:40:38,138 --> 00:40:40,585
Jake, I need an answer.
What's it gonna be?

516
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,617
Nuts.

517
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:49,312
Sorry, I didn't get that.

518
00:40:50,132 --> 00:40:51,975
You can go straight to hell.

519
00:40:56,859 --> 00:40:58,364
About my father...

520
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,444
you're the one I'm coming for.

521
00:41:08,937 --> 00:41:09,946
I want to go home.

522
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,348
Our orders are to take people
out of the conflict zone.

523
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,992
You'll be safer in Cheyenne.

524
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:15,793
Colonel Hoffman?

525
00:41:16,789 --> 00:41:17,798
What is all this?

526
00:41:17,898 --> 00:41:20,393
- Sir, wheels up in five minutes.
- Roger that.

527
00:41:20,671 --> 00:41:23,856
- Jericho's been moved up to priority #1
on the list.  - Thank you.

528
00:41:23,956 --> 00:41:25,155
Oh, God, thank you.

529
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,788
This is all thanks to you.

530
00:41:26,888 --> 00:41:29,565
Don't worry. We're gonna get things
back to normal again.

531
00:41:29,851 --> 00:41:31,009
All right, saddle up.

532
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:01,755
My father expected us
to make a stand here.

533
00:42:05,568 --> 00:42:07,044
To defend our home.

534
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,763
That's what we're gonna do.

535
00:42:29,378 --> 00:42:30,428
Smoke bombs!

536
00:42:30,528 --> 00:42:31,763
Get in position!

537
00:42:38,678 --> 00:42:40,316
Don't waste your rounds!

538
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:43,154
Wait for a clean shot!

539
00:42:49,142 --> 00:42:50,145
Wait...

540
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,193
Wait...

541
00:43:10,027 --> 00:43:11,030
Wait...

542
00:43:16,641 --> 00:43:17,953
Now!
