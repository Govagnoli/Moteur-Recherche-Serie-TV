<i>Previously on</i> Jericho

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:04,734
Oh, my God, Ted.

3
00:00:05,661 --> 00:00:08,233
- Jake, this is... Ted Lewis.
- Hey, how you doing?

4
00:00:08,272 --> 00:00:09,763
We grew up together over in New Bern.

5
00:00:09,773 --> 00:00:10,996
This is Russell and Mike.

6
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:12,173
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,911
With a dozen full-size windmills,
you could power the whole town.

8
00:00:14,937 --> 00:00:17,409
I'm gonna help turn the lights on
for everyone back home.

9
00:00:17,425 --> 00:00:19,670
- You're just going to leave?
- Won't be for very long.

10
00:00:21,908 --> 00:00:23,442
Johnston, you SOB.

11
00:00:23,755 --> 00:00:25,385
How the hell did you lose an election?

12
00:00:25,395 --> 00:00:28,049
No, the question is: how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?

13
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:30,638
- They get tired of you being sheriff?
- No, I'm still sheriff.

14
00:00:30,648 --> 00:00:32,164
Just got a little more authority.

15
00:00:32,174 --> 00:00:34,409
Does this thing work?
Can we get power from it?

16
00:00:34,419 --> 00:00:35,504
Probably sometime tomorrow.

17
00:00:35,514 --> 00:00:36,972
Let's get it up as fast as we can.

18
00:00:36,982 --> 00:00:38,471
Can we buy some more of these things?

19
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:41,144
You got one of the only salt
mines around for 400 miles.

20
00:00:41,164 --> 00:00:43,686
- We're going to need food.
- Won't see another crop till spring.

21
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:45,216
Spring crop is what I'm talking about.

22
00:00:45,232 --> 00:00:47,164
Ten wind turbines for, let's say...

23
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:48,809
ten percent of your spring crop.

24
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:50,450
No, we can't put ourselves
in that position.

25
00:00:50,481 --> 00:00:52,288
Starve next fall or freeze this winter.

26
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:54,229
Okay, look,
we'll give you the food.

27
00:00:54,307 --> 00:00:56,575
We can have the wind turbines
to you in a couple weeks.

28
00:00:56,622 --> 00:00:59,016
We're going to need ten Jericho
men to help us build them.

29
00:00:59,047 --> 00:01:01,566
Is this about manpower
for wind turbines?

30
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,672
Or is it more about making sure
you get our crops come spring?

31
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:06,873
I am not going to build
these things on credit.

32
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:09,029
You want them now?
You're going to help make them.

33
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:11,032
What you are about to do...

34
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:12,909
means this town's survival.

35
00:01:13,128 --> 00:01:14,356
All right, let's move out.

36
00:01:14,419 --> 00:01:15,984
If anything happens
to any of them...

37
00:01:16,516 --> 00:01:18,315
you're the first one I come for.

38
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,441
I know.

39
00:01:57,781 --> 00:01:59,110
<i>Hey, Jeff, they're back.

40
00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:02,380
I didn't expect to see
you till spring, Russell.

41
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:05,197
I thought you might
be needing these.

42
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:07,769
Your windmills.

43
00:02:13,288 --> 00:02:15,400
It's good to see our guys back, but...

44
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:18,881
it's going to take some time for me
to find the guys to replace them.

45
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:20,817
You don't need to replace them.

46
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,218
Well, now, wait...

47
00:02:22,297 --> 00:02:24,501
our agreement was that
we got ten windmills

48
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,680
for ten percent of the crops.

49
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:28,750
You'll get your windmills,
but we don't need your men.

50
00:02:29,078 --> 00:02:31,941
Constantino called it
an act of good faith.

51
00:02:32,831 --> 00:02:35,224
I didn't think Constantino
knew that term.

52
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,510
But...
I'll take it.

53
00:02:42,308 --> 00:02:43,309
Stanley!

54
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:47,416
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

55
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:49,399
Where's Eric?

56
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:52,982
He didn't come back, Mary.

57
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:56,363
He said he wasn't ready.

58
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,021
But...

59
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,102
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

60
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:02,523
Okay.
Thanks.

61
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:10,931
I didn't know you guys
were coming back today.

62
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,935
- None of us did.
- How are you? You okay?

63
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:16,023
Where's Eric?

64
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,772
Come here.

65
00:03:22,705 --> 00:03:24,300
He didn't come back with us.

66
00:03:25,427 --> 00:03:26,460
Why not?

67
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:29,490
When I talked to him, he was still
pretty messed up about April's death.

68
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,288
He said he was thinking about
staying in New Bern for a while

69
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:34,697
to get his head together.
- When was this?

70
00:03:34,963 --> 00:03:36,262
Three days ago.

71
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:39,276
Then, he didn't show up for work,
and I haven't seen him since.

72
00:03:39,448 --> 00:03:41,310
I don't know what's
going on in New Bern.

73
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:43,464
When I asked about Eric,
they couldn't tell me anything.

74
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:46,457
Then, the cops started escorting
us wherever we went.

75
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,278
Then today, out of nowhere,
Russell says,

76
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:50,139
"Pack it up, we're going home",
like...

77
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,972
like it wasn't safe for us
there anymore.

78
00:03:58,344 --> 00:03:59,611
Where's my brother?

79
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:02,662
- I don't know.
- What?

80
00:04:03,257 --> 00:04:04,978
I know he hasn't been
seen for a few days.

81
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:06,417
Did you even try to find him?

82
00:04:06,558 --> 00:04:08,248
- I asked Constantino.
- And?

83
00:04:08,773 --> 00:04:11,041
And he told me that
they were looking for him.

84
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:13,967
And then this morning, he told me
to bring the rest of your guys home.

85
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:16,141
What the hell's going on
over there, Russell?

86
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:19,192
Should I be worried about him?

87
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:22,063
Answer me.
Should I be worried?

88
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,572
I would be.

89
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:30,265
- I'm going with you.
- No...

90
00:04:30,782 --> 00:04:32,138
you've been gone for weeks.
Go home.

91
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:33,885
You need someone who knows
their way around New Bern.

92
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:35,163
I'll try to find Heather
as soon as I get there.

93
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:36,623
She knows it better than any of us.

94
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:38,422
Look, it's not safe out there.

95
00:04:38,438 --> 00:04:39,752
You can't go by yourself.

96
00:04:40,174 --> 00:04:41,175
I'm not.

97
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:46,918
I need your help.

102
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,720
You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china, Jake.

103
00:05:07,777 --> 00:05:10,171
I got to try and find him.
I can't just...

104
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:14,646
There's something going on in that town.
I can feel it.

105
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:17,637
Stanley starts asking questions,
and they just send them home?

106
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:21,171
Okay, but you understand why
I can't just up and leave, right?

107
00:05:23,484 --> 00:05:25,414
- He's my brother.
- And you said he was upset,

108
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:27,670
so maybe he just...
- If you're saying no, just say no.

109
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,819
Come on, Jake, I'm not saying no.

110
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:32,678
I'm saying we got to
understand the situation.

111
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:34,164
The situation is...

112
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:37,114
he's been missing for three days,
and I came to you...

113
00:05:37,615 --> 00:05:38,616
for help.

114
00:05:41,784 --> 00:05:42,785
Okay.

115
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:48,876
But if we do this,
we do it my way.

116
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,084
Oh, my God.

117
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:18,503
I'm so glad you're home.

118
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:20,130
I missed you guys so much.

119
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:27,819
You're totally back.

120
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,839
<i>Mrs. Green.

121
00:06:31,621 --> 00:06:34,343
I'm really sorry to bother
you like this, but...

122
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:36,015
I thought you should know.

123
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:37,180
Know what?

124
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:41,068
The men came back from New Bern,
and Eric wasn't with them.

125
00:06:41,656 --> 00:06:42,658
Why not?

126
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:45,443
He decided to stay a little longer.

127
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,836
Decided to or Constantino insisted?

128
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:51,623
Stanley talked to him.
He said...

129
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:54,228
he said he wasn't ready
to come home.

130
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:01,432
- How'd you hurt your hand?
- Oh, I just...

131
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,795
was trying to fix the copper
tubing on my still.

132
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:05,245
It just popped off and cut me.

133
00:07:05,276 --> 00:07:07,435
Is alcohol really a priority right now?

134
00:07:08,296 --> 00:07:09,573
Actually, it's not to drink.

135
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,458
I was trying to make antiseptic
for the med center.

136
00:07:14,953 --> 00:07:15,954
I should go.

137
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:19,067
- You got any sand over there
at the bar?  - Sand?

138
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:22,525
Yeah, I think I can show you a way
around that copper tubing.

139
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:24,606
I'll just give you a hand.

140
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,624
See you in a bit.

141
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:37,350
Guys... yo, listen.

142
00:07:37,882 --> 00:07:40,510
Stop unloading that.
Put that back.

143
00:07:45,863 --> 00:07:47,084
What the hell is this?

144
00:07:47,365 --> 00:07:49,962
- Salt.  - Who gave you permission
to take it from the mine?

145
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:51,981
51% of the mine belongs to me.

146
00:07:52,043 --> 00:07:53,577
I just took it from my half.

147
00:07:53,717 --> 00:07:56,768
You don't have a half...
of anything. Your parents do.

148
00:07:56,902 --> 00:07:59,374
Look, I know you still think
of me as a child...

149
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:01,486
and I can't help it if that's
where you're stuck,

150
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:03,990
but the fact is I have
a right to what I own.

151
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,664
You are a minor and
you don't own anything

152
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:08,926
as long as your parents
are still alive.

153
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:11,898
Or do you have some information
that I don't have?

154
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:16,552
Look, just... just take
the salt back to the mine

155
00:08:16,568 --> 00:08:19,227
and don't make me have to
send my guys to do it.

156
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:43,593
Proof of residence?

157
00:08:44,195 --> 00:08:45,298
We're not from here.

158
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:47,523
Sorry, you're going to need
to turn this car around

159
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:49,374
and proceed back
the way you came.

160
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:52,738
I'm here to see my brother.
His name is Eric Green.

161
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:54,670
You're not hearing me, sir.
No one's allowed...

162
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,528
No, you're not hearing me.
I have to see him.

163
00:08:56,538 --> 00:08:59,064
He came here as part of the deal
you made with Jericho. Now...

164
00:08:59,074 --> 00:09:00,321
Hey, Jake...

165
00:09:04,472 --> 00:09:06,053
I want to talk to Phil Constantino.

166
00:09:06,084 --> 00:09:07,961
- Get out of the car.
- Hell, no.

167
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,159
Put your hands on the dashboard.

168
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,452
I want to see your hands.

169
00:09:14,243 --> 00:09:17,113
That's Johnston Green's son.
Let him through.

170
00:09:19,717 --> 00:09:22,330
I'll escort him in
to see Sheriff Constantino.

171
00:09:27,618 --> 00:09:29,073
Go ahead, let him through.

172
00:09:46,774 --> 00:09:47,794
<i>Mister, Mister.

173
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,367
Do you have any food?

174
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:50,934
I'm sorry, I don't...

175
00:09:50,944 --> 00:09:52,355
I'm sorry, I don't have any.

176
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:55,473
All right, ma'am, come on.
Get those kids out of there.

177
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:56,580
Hey, come on.

178
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:57,922
<i>Come on, please.

179
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,965
I thought we had it bad.

180
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:27,825
What the hell happened here?

181
00:10:28,224 --> 00:10:29,231
Ravenwood.

182
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,770
My brother is missing.

183
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:34,907
I know. I've got patrols
out looking for him.

184
00:10:34,978 --> 00:10:36,246
- And no leads?
- No.

185
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,777
Sorry, I wish there's
more I could do.

186
00:10:39,034 --> 00:10:41,142
You're the sheriff and the mayor.
You can do more.

187
00:10:41,185 --> 00:10:42,324
I'm trying, Jake.

188
00:10:42,937 --> 00:10:44,535
You sure Eric even
wants to be found?

189
00:10:44,592 --> 00:10:45,860
What's that supposed to mean?

190
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,296
We all knew April.
We know what happened.

191
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,660
Last I heard that Eric was
having a tough time.

192
00:10:50,831 --> 00:10:52,526
He'll be fine as soon as
we get him home.

193
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:54,877
You know what?
Let's face the facts.

194
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:56,360
He might have been attacked.

195
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,127
Could be lying in a
ditch somewhere.

196
00:10:58,255 --> 00:11:00,392
- Why would you say...
- Take it easy!

197
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,042
The fact is some folks around here
aren't too fond of Jericho these days.

198
00:11:06,195 --> 00:11:08,380
That's why I sent the workers home
today. When your brother went missing,

199
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,778
I got worried for their safety.

200
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:10,904
Why?

201
00:11:11,123 --> 00:11:14,284
There's been a lot of rumors
flying around about your town.

202
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:15,833
What are people saying?

203
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:18,749
They're mad that Jericho didn't
warn us about Ravenwood.

204
00:11:18,843 --> 00:11:21,816
They think you're going to renege
on your part of the food deal.

205
00:11:21,925 --> 00:11:23,631
We've had it rough here, okay?

206
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,274
They're just looking for
somebody to blame.

207
00:11:25,356 --> 00:11:27,750
- Where was Eric last seen?
- The factory.

208
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,064
End of his shift.

209
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,348
Look, we're just trying to help.

210
00:11:31,912 --> 00:11:34,564
What is it that you want
that we're not giving?

211
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,802
I want to talk to Heather Lisinski.

212
00:11:40,306 --> 00:11:42,121
<i>Take care of each other, Kansas.

213
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,685
Anything new from Mr. Hewitt?

214
00:11:46,732 --> 00:11:51,082
No, it's just the same bulletin about
the riots in Chicago Camp West.

215
00:11:51,222 --> 00:11:53,108
Hey, thanks for taking on a shift.

216
00:11:53,327 --> 00:11:56,268
Jimmy, it's the least I can do
to make myself useful.

217
00:11:56,636 --> 00:11:59,249
I feel like such a freeloader
sitting around your house all day.

218
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,281
You kidding me?

219
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:02,737
You're like the best houseguest ever.

220
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:06,340
You cook, you do the dishes, you
never get bored playing Boggle.

221
00:12:06,402 --> 00:12:09,641
And we're dreading the day you
and your husband work things out.

222
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:13,711
That sounded a lot less
insensitive in my head.

223
00:12:13,742 --> 00:12:16,152
- I'm sorry.
- No, I understand, thank you.

224
00:12:18,222 --> 00:12:19,223
Listen...

225
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,398
can I talk you about something?

226
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:23,244
Yeah, what is it?

227
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:25,779
Last night Sam and Woody were

228
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:27,218
drawing pictures.

229
00:12:29,563 --> 00:12:30,893
That's one of Sam's.

230
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,104
I didn't want to bring it up at
the house with everyone around,

231
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:39,241
I thought it might be upsetting.

232
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,417
No, I'm glad you showed
this to me.

233
00:12:42,683 --> 00:12:44,216
I'm not a psychiatrist,

234
00:12:45,558 --> 00:12:49,266
but that really looks like a kid
dealing with some kind of trauma.

235
00:12:51,175 --> 00:12:53,428
I'm-I'm not surprised.
I mean....

236
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:55,731
30 million people died a few months ago.

237
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:58,403
I'll bet there's kids all over the
country still trying to process that.

238
00:12:58,413 --> 00:13:00,847
Maybe, but it's so specific.

239
00:13:02,068 --> 00:13:03,898
The bodies, the house.

240
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,815
He's coming by after school.
I'll talk to him then.

241
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:10,396
- Thank you.
- Sure.

242
00:13:17,648 --> 00:13:20,636
Sand keeps the copper from buckling.

243
00:13:22,326 --> 00:13:23,468
How'd you learn this?

244
00:13:24,443 --> 00:13:25,444
Well...

245
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:30,153
like... most things that
are fun and illegal...

246
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:31,780
from my dad.

247
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,968
So the stories Eric tells are true.

248
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:36,423
Afraid so.

249
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:42,610
You remember that book...

250
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,759
something about...
women are from Venus,

251
00:13:45,816 --> 00:13:47,610
and men are wrong.

252
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:51,357
Not that I read the book, mind you,
but I did,  you know...

253
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,575
flip through Gail's copy of it.

254
00:13:54,985 --> 00:13:57,550
Lot of stuff in there about
men needing to...

255
00:13:58,219 --> 00:14:01,211
go off and hold up in
a cave sometime.

256
00:14:03,732 --> 00:14:06,994
Now, I don't know if this was
actually in the book, but...

257
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:10,427
if men can't find a cave,
they'll make one.

258
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,579
Out of...

259
00:14:11,838 --> 00:14:14,967
whatever circumstances happen
to be lying around.

260
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,448
Yeah, you're probably right.

261
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,312
I'm sure that's all it is.

262
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,007
This isn't your fault, Mary.

263
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:28,870
It wasn't anybody's fault.

264
00:14:30,553 --> 00:14:32,665
I think Eric's figuring that out.

265
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:40,683
This place is the only reason New Bern
made it through the Depression.

266
00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:43,366
The factory whistle's like
a heartbeat to this town.

267
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:46,526
Put the wind turbines binds
together just down here.

268
00:14:46,698 --> 00:14:47,699
Sheriff!

269
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:50,930
Who's that?

270
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:53,277
It's a friend of Heather's.
We met him at Black Jack.

271
00:14:53,431 --> 00:14:54,479
Good news.

272
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:57,436
- This guy knows where your brother is.
- Really? Where?

273
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,531
Eric went home.

274
00:14:58,969 --> 00:15:01,629
He and Heather both.
They... left this morning.

275
00:15:01,864 --> 00:15:04,336
- Home? To Jericho?
- Why would they do that?

276
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:06,499
Why didn't they go
with the convoy?

277
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,362
Well, Heather had to talk
him into going. So...

278
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,208
by then, the other guys had left.

279
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:13,227
So, I lent them my car
and my rifle.

280
00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:15,120
They didn't seem worried at all.

281
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:17,063
Probably back in Jericho by now.

282
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:19,660
Right.

283
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:23,258
- Hope they're okay.
- Thank you.

284
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:25,433
- We got to clear the building.
- All right.

285
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,490
What happened?

286
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,345
We had to retrofit all the
machines after the EMP,

287
00:15:29,454 --> 00:15:32,286
and one of them overheated.
Caught part of the building on fire.

288
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:33,710
You got what you need?

289
00:15:34,555 --> 00:15:36,056
Yeah, mystery solved, I guess.

290
00:15:36,107 --> 00:15:37,328
Good. Glad to hear it.

291
00:15:37,406 --> 00:15:39,346
If there's nothing else, Deputy Perkins
will escort you out of town.

292
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,380
No. We don't need
to be escorted.

293
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:42,991
It's policy.

294
00:15:43,163 --> 00:15:44,337
You're big on policy.

295
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,337
We almost lost everything when
Ravenwood came through here.

296
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,731
I'm big on anything that
keeps us alive.

297
00:15:54,365 --> 00:15:55,695
- Thanks.
- No problem.

298
00:16:01,936 --> 00:16:02,938
Move the truck.

299
00:16:03,282 --> 00:16:04,408
Let them through.

300
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:06,833
- You buying any of that story?
- Nope.

301
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:09,999
Neither was Ted.

302
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:13,472
Slipped me this when
he shook my hand.

303
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,070
- It's an address and...
- "Come Alone"

304
00:16:20,222 --> 00:16:21,630
So, we done here?

305
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,252
<i>Back it up.

306
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:34,836
<i>Let them through.

307
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,046
How long have I been gone?

308
00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:46,604
No, before you answer that,

309
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:49,154
how long has he been here?
- It's very recent really.

310
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:50,890
He hasn't been here that long.

311
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,502
I asked you to do one
thing for me, Mimi.

312
00:16:53,784 --> 00:16:54,785
One thing!

313
00:16:56,268 --> 00:16:58,068
You know, you listen
to me, Stanley.

314
00:16:58,162 --> 00:17:00,117
Your sister is not a child anymore.

315
00:17:00,148 --> 00:17:02,761
You can't just throw this fit
and kick Sean's ass

316
00:17:02,777 --> 00:17:04,154
and think that's going
to be the end of it

317
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:05,842
I hope you're going to
explain why I can't.

318
00:17:05,852 --> 00:17:07,041
Because if you do,

319
00:17:07,354 --> 00:17:09,951
she's just going to latch
on that much tighter.

320
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:11,688
Unless they really get angry,

321
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:14,233
in which case, the age-old teenage
remedy is to run away,

322
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:16,204
which used to mean that they'd
hear from them in a couple of days

323
00:17:16,214 --> 00:17:17,516
when they ran out of bus money.

324
00:17:17,814 --> 00:17:19,535
Nowadays, chances are much better

325
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,788
that you'll find their bodies
on the side of a road.

326
00:17:24,024 --> 00:17:25,026
Look...

327
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,091
right now it is under our roof.

328
00:17:27,638 --> 00:17:29,532
And it's a pain in the ass, I know,

329
00:17:29,797 --> 00:17:32,207
but it's a safe and manageable
pain in the ass,

330
00:17:32,395 --> 00:17:33,990
and I suggest you let it stay here

331
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,498
before it turns into anything
more than that.

332
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:14,170
That's Perkins' truck.

333
00:18:14,514 --> 00:18:16,846
What's he doing staking
out Ted's trailer?

334
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:18,739
Let's ask him.

335
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:31,906
Hand your gun to my friend,
and let's pay Ted a little visit.

336
00:18:32,373 --> 00:18:33,405
Come on.

337
00:18:42,752 --> 00:18:43,936
Where's my brother?

338
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:45,161
I don't know, ask him.

339
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:48,042
He threatened to throw me in jail this
morning if I didn't feed you that lie.

340
00:18:48,057 --> 00:18:50,195
- So you haven't seen Eric?
- No. Not for days.

341
00:18:50,205 --> 00:18:52,448
- What about Heather?
- She left for work this morning.

342
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,261
Next thing I know, they tell
me she's gone missing, too.

343
00:18:54,276 --> 00:18:56,247
Two people disappear,
nobody knows anything?

344
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:57,699
Oh, somebody does.

345
00:18:59,623 --> 00:19:00,625
Right?

346
00:19:03,973 --> 00:19:04,990
Where is he?

347
00:19:06,617 --> 00:19:07,618
Screw you.

348
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,591
Hey, come on, Jake,
we got to be smarter than that.

349
00:19:10,638 --> 00:19:11,843
We need answers.

350
00:19:14,878 --> 00:19:17,428
Getting answers...
is easy.

351
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:20,275
It's getting the truth...

352
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:22,137
that takes work.

353
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,850
When did you last see Eric Green?

354
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,950
Look...

355
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,850
this is not my thing.

356
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,550
I didn't ask you that, did I?

357
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,650
Why do you act like
we did something wrong?

358
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,050
We were attacked.

359
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,650
How do you figure that?

360
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,350
The those machines didn't overheat

361
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,750
this morning at the factory.

362
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,150
It was his brother...

363
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,350
and that girl.

364
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,850
They sabotaged it.

365
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,850
They would never do that?
We need that factory

366
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,250
just as much as you do.

367
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,550
- I saw them.
- If you saw them, then where are they?

368
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,450
They ran away.

369
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,350
Hold his knees, please.

370
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,250
Look,

371
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,350
why would I be staking out

372
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,050
a trailer park if we had them? Huh?

373
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,550
Constantino put us on alert.
He gave a SOS.

374
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,350
- SOS?
- Shoot on sight.

375
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,950
Look at me.

376
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,750
What is in that factory?

377
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,350
I don't know.

378
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,050
No, I'm a cop. I'm a cop.
Ask Constantino.

379
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,450
Ask Constantino.

380
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,750
He knows?

381
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,550
Look at me.

382
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,450
- We go to the factory.
- But Eric...

383
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,850
I don't know about Eric.

384
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,150
But we cannot search this whole town.

385
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,350
So we should go and see what it was
that he was risking his life for.

386
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,650
All right.

387
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,650
You got some place safe you can go?

388
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,050
Yeah, my grandfather has
an old hunting cabin.

389
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:38,750
You take what's important because
you are not coming back here.

390
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,250
Get up.

391
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,250
On your knees.

392
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,450
What is he doing?

393
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,350
- Down on your knees.
- What?

394
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,950
What are you doing?

395
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,050
Hawkins!

396
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,050
Is that doing it your way?

397
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,050
You asked me to come along.

398
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,950
- What were you going to do?
- You want the truth?

399
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,950
Less than you would have.

400
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,550
You see, I've done...

401
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,950
I've done enough, Jake,
to know better.

402
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,650
It's the fear of torture
that gets results.

403
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,550
Actual torture only works
in the movies.

404
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,050
And this one guy, he was
so skinny, you could

405
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,150
count his ribs through his shirt.

406
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,450
I tried to give him food when I could,
but none of us had much so...

407
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,850
And then one day, I could just...

408
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,550
see it in his eyes.
He'd, uh...

409
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,050
he'd given up.

410
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,850
I never thought I'd be so
thankful to live on a farm.

411
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,550
From now on, I promise
I'll only complain intermittently.

412
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,950
Well, we don't have much, but, uh...

413
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,350
we'll always have enough, so...

414
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,750
Dude, all they need to do
is get the Internet back up.

415
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,150
After that, it's a piece of cake.

416
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,850
Why is that?

417
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,650
Well, you could do anything.

418
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,650
I mean, you could run for president.
Make a virtual White House.

419
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,350
Fly a plane into that.

420
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,950
I mean, virtual cities and towns...

421
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,250
nothing to nuke.
- Yeah, but...

422
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,050
where would we get...

423
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,350
stuff?

424
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:49,850
What stuff?

425
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:50,950
I don't know.

426
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,450
Food, clothes, blankets, fuel.

427
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,250
Not a problem.

428
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:58,450
After the Internet is back up,
you just order all that stuff.

429
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,250
You know, Stanley,
you would not believe

430
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:04,150
how helpful Sean has been
around here with the livestock,

431
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,650
and the house,
and... just everything.

432
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,050
It's true.

433
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,350
Yeah, it's weird, Stanley, 'cause

434
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,650
I am much more of a vibe guy.

435
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,150
What the hell is a vibe guy?

436
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,950
You know...

437
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,950
I mean, I've never been into, like,

438
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,350
physical labor.

439
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,350
I'm more the guy that people
have around for my vibe.

440
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,150
My house, my rules, my vibe.

441
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,550
And you sleep there.

442
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:09,650
So anyhow, it's, like, 3:00 a. m.,
I've got this flashlight in my face.

443
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:12,550
Gail's over on her side of
the bed trying to find the phone

444
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,750
to call the cops and finally,
I located the light switch.

445
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,050
It's Eric,

446
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,650
who's standing there and he says,

447
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,150
"I can't go to sleep until
I confess I'm drunk. "

448
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,750
I said, "You're what?"

449
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,250
He said, "I'm drunk."

450
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,050
"It won't ever happen again.
I don't know what I was thinking."

451
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,550
Well, meantime,
he looks perfectly normal,

452
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,450
his speech isn't slurred or anything.

453
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,150
Gail starts grilling him. Turns out
he has had a beer and a half.

454
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,850
I said to him,
"Son, do you have any idea

455
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,650
how much beer it takes to get drunk?"

456
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,450
He said, "No, I don't. "

457
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,650
I said, "Well, get out of here and

458
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,250
don't wake me up again until you do."

459
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,950
He left, Gail and
I just could not stop laughing.

460
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,950
She doesn't laugh too much anymore.

461
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:15,350
Here I am rambling on. We probably ought
to go take a look at that still.

462
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:16,950
Good idea.

463
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,950
Hey, buddy.

464
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,750
Your mom just ran to the little
girls' room. Why don't you grab a seat?

465
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,550
Could you give us a minute?

466
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,250
Sure.

467
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,650
Say, you know what?

468
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,850
Why don't we go sit in my office,
maybe we can talk.

469
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,050
About what?

470
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,150
About your artwork.

471
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,050
This is Russell.

472
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,150
He saved our butts out
at the Black Jack.

473
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,950
Hi. It's nice to meet you. I'm Skylar.

474
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,250
Stevens, right?

475
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,750
Something we can help you with?

476
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,250
Well, I was thinking
we could help each other.

477
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,850
You've got a salt mine
with no real distributor.

478
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,550
I've got men, trucks, guns,

479
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,950
but no supplies.

480
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,350
- If we become partners...
- Partners?

481
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:24,550
I'm asking for half
your share of the mine.

482
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,350
We're doing okay now.

483
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,950
Okay, but the people in Jericho,
they only need so much salt.

484
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,950
I've been out there.

485
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,550
I know the trade routes,
where to find the highest bidders

486
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,450
and how to make it
back here in one piece.

487
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,150
What's in it for us?

488
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,650
Bigger profits.

489
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:45,550
Where I'm going, I can get you
five times what you can make here.

490
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:46,950
And...

491
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,950
I'll deal with Gray Anderson for you.

492
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,050
When do you need an answer?

493
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,750
Before I leave in the morning.

494
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,250
Believe me,

495
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,350
this is good for everyone.

496
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,350
It's a full inventory of Jericho.

497
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,250
It's our mine.

498
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,550
And our town.

499
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,200
They sliced it up like they own it.

500
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,500
What do they know that we don't?

501
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Come on.

502
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Hey, sweetie.
What's going on?

503
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
We were talking about my drawings.

504
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,300
Look, do you mind waiting
in the lobby a minute?

505
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,100
I just need to talk to
Mr. Taylor alone. Okay?

506
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,500
What are you doing?

507
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,300
Darcy, something going on,
and it's not just about the bombs.

508
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,700
My son has enough to deal with,
you know, without

509
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,500
being poked and prodded.

510
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,300
If there's a problem with him,
I'll take care of it myself.

511
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,500
Right.

512
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,800
Thank you.

513
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,600
For what?

514
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,400
Letting Sean stay.

515
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,300
You're welcome.

516
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,600
And for not calling him an idiot
even when he is done.

517
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,500
Okay, if you know that...

518
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,500
Sorry. Just a little frog
in my throat.

519
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,200
Don't let me interrupt your nice

520
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,200
sibling-bonding moment.

521
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,100
That's what it is, right?

522
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,100
Sean can be an idiot,

523
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,200
but he can also be really great.

524
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,500
All guys are like that,

525
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,400
you have to put up with the
"idiot" stuff...

526
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,400
to get to the "great" stuff.

527
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,000
Yeah? And where did you come
by that litlle pearl of wisdom?

528
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,800
What did she say about me?

529
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,900
When did he learn how to sign?

530
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,600
He's sleeping with a deaf girl.

531
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,100
That's my sister.

532
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,200
I guess if Sean Henthorn is
my biggest problem, then

533
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm a pretty lucky guy.

534
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,100
Want to get luckier?

535
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,700
What are you doing?

536
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,800
It's binding.

537
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,900
The lawyer said it makes me
an emancipated minor.

538
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
By declaring your parents dead?

539
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,200
This is wrong

540
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,394
in every way that
something can be wrong.

541
00:33:33,404 --> 00:33:35,558
- Let's just forget about this.
- You can't do that.

542
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,700
- It's legal.
- So,

543
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,898
what, are you gonna pedal your little
bike to Topeka and file this, Dale?

544
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,800
Forget that I'm the mayor.

545
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,100
Okay, I'm speaking to you as
your parents' friend.

546
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,600
My parents would want me to have
my share of the salt mine

547
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,400
Your parents are coming back.

548
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,900
And if it turns out that
that is not true,

549
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,100
then I will help you learn the business.

550
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,800
And who decides when that happens?

551
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,000
You?

552
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,400
I mean my decision, are you saying
laws don't apply any more?

553
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,900
You didn't make a decision.
You signed a piece of paper.

554
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,900
Do you really want your parents
to be dead that badly?

555
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,600
- Okay, stop it.
- No.

556
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,800
You're advising her, Dale.

557
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,900
Did you also tell her
how her parents died?

558
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,300
Because New York survived,

559
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,765
so I guess you probably had
to get pretty creative, right?

560
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,100
Were they killed there?

561
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,900
Or were they murdered
on their way back

562
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,400
to the child who meant
everything to them?

563
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,000
It's just a piece of paper.

564
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,400
Come on.

565
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,500
They're making mortar rounds.

566
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,600
They're running a munitions factory.

567
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,700
Hurry up.
Constantino wants those tonight.

568
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,000
We'll have them ready.

569
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,700
They're getting ready for war.

570
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,900
We need to get back to town.

571
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,100
No, we need to try and stop them.
Cover me.

572
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,600
Hey, there he goes.
Down there.

573
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,600
Hold it!

574
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,800
Hand it over.

575
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,200
Sorry. I guess I'm late for dinner.

576
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,800
Or lunch.

577
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,600
Take your pick.

578
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,900
I was helping Mary.
It took longer than I expected.

579
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,000
You told Eric we'd take care of her.

580
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,000
What I meant was that
we'd help keep her alive.

581
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,500
What I didn't mean was that
we'd run over there

582
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
and spend the entire day
every time she needed

583
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,000
somebody to do
a little heavy lifting.

584
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,100
Wait.

585
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,900
You don't think
I'm the reason Eric left?

586
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
Do you?

587
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,200
Is that what you think?

588
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,000
I think Eric left for
a lot of reasons...

589
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,700
...but Mary may be why he comes back.

590
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,300
I don't want to have to come back
to this house again.

591
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Did you get all the toys you want?

592
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,900
So,

593
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,800
what did you and Mr. Taylor
talk about today?

594
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,100
Nothing.

595
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,300
Now, Sam, you know we don't keep
secrets in this family.

596
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,600
Yeah, I know, baby.

597
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,600
What's he doing here?

598
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,400
I think we should talk.

599
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,100
Hey, Sam, honey,
why don't you go upstairs

600
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,500
to your room and
get that last box, okay?

601
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,800
Hey, buddy.

602
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,500
Look, I-I understand, you know,
you being curious about my family.

603
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,900
We haven't made a lot of friends here.

604
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,400
We just kind of keep to ourselves, but

605
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,000
if you want to ask any questions,
just talk to me, okay?

606
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,300
Leave my children out of it.

607
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,700
But I think Sam's trying to say
something with that drawing.

608
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,300
Something he can't put into words.

609
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,800
What do you mean?

610
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,500
He's drawing a little boy
that's afraid...

611
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,900
...because his dad's not
around to protect him

612
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,500
or his family.

613
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,000
I told him he's not alone.

614
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,200
I know what it's like to have
parents who have split up.

615
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,600
I told him
I'd been through it, and...

616
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,200
I think I turned out okay, so...

617
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,700
I think you turned out better
than okay, Jimmy.

618
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,200
I appreciate that.

619
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,900
So, I guess I'll head back
to the house then.

620
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,200
See you there.

621
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,800
Thank you, Jimmy.

622
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,000
Sure.

623
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,500
- How did it go?
- Good.

624
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,100
Turbines all went up without a hitch.

625
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
Thank...

626
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,600
Thank you.

627
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,600
You were as good as your word.
Even better.

628
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,800
I'm glad you see it that way,

629
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,700
because I have another
proposition for you.

630
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,700
We need salt.

631
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,800
Well, it's no problem.
I'll have my guys load up your truck.

632
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,300
Well, actually,

633
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,900
I mean to help you sell it.

634
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,600
We were thinking
a quarter stake in the mine.

635
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,400
Would we be Constantino?

636
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,200
Is that what all of
this good will was about?

637
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,800
No. Hear me out.

638
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,800
This will work for both of us.

639
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,100
For both of our towns.

640
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,000
If you agree to let me sell salt
from the mine.

641
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,700
I'm sorry.

642
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,100
I guess you and the, uh, Olsen twins
think this is kind of cute.

643
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,200
Well, for whatever it's worth,
we did conduct a legal transaction.

644
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,000
- Not for sale.
- Your people on New Bern

645
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,099
who think it should be.
- I don't care what they think.

646
00:41:14,157 --> 00:41:15,600
You need to.

647
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,200
When I saw that

648
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,400
map of Jericho,

649
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,300
I asked Heather about it.

650
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,900
She didn't think

651
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,300
New Bern could do that to us.

652
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,100
Then she snuck in, and, uh...

653
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,600
she saw the mortars and...

654
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,700
their plans.

655
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,400
Look, you're going back to whatever

656
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,000
rock you crawled out from under.

657
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,300
Dan, get in here!

658
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,100
Mr. Mayor, there's a lot more
going on here than you realize.

659
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,100
- Is that so?
- I'm trying to help you.

660
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,200
Look, New Bern barely
survived the winter.

661
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,800
And the people there, they know
the food is coming from you.

662
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,800
And they also know that it's not going
to be enough to feed everyone,

663
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,800
and so, some of them, they're thinking,
what can we do about that

664
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
right now?

665
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,700
I want you to find every deputy you can
and get them up to the salt mine.

666
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,400
I want it under heavy guard
until further notice.

667
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,100
Gray, I've already got men up there.

668
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,200
Gray, listen to me.

669
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,500
This deal is a good thing.

670
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,100
I know you don't see it that way
right now, but please,

671
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,600
you do not want the alternative.

672
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,000
These rumors about Jericho,

673
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,700
about the food hoarding,

674
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,000
about how they sicced Ravenwood on us...

675
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,700
maybe they're not just rumors.

676
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
We restored their power supply,

677
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,200
and now that Jericho has what it needs,

678
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,300
it has no intention of making good
on its half of the deal.

679
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,200
Why didn't you just leave town?

680
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,100
'Cause we wanted to break the machine,

681
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,900
stop the factory.

682
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,400
Then they caught us.

683
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,000
They brought me here.

684
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,000
So, where is she?

685
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,000
Where is Heather?

686
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,200
She's dead, Jake.

687
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,100
But it's not enough for them
to keep their food

688
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,500
and leave us to starve.

689
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,300
You, up. You, too.

690
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,200
They want to see us destroyed.

691
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,300
I looked their mayor in the eye,

692
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,900
I told him how desperate
our situation was.

693
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,800
But on the day

694
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,300
that we made good
on our end of the deal,

695
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,900
what did they do?

696
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,400
They tried to destroy the factory

697
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,200
that keeps this town alive.

698
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,500
Here's your proof.

699
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,800
These are the sons of Johnston Green,

700
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,600
sent from Jericho to wreak
havoc on this town.

701
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,700
Now we know,

702
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,400
if these people had their way,

703
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,800
New Bern would cease to exist.

704
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,500
With your help

705
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,100
and sacrifice,

706
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,100
I will make sure that
that never happens.
