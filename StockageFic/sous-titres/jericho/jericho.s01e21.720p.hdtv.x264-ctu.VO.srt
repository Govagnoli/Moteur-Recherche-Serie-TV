2
00:00:02,226 --> 00:00:03,232
Hello, Jonah.

3
00:00:03,332 --> 00:00:05,948
Guy did four years at Lansing
for extortion and assault.

4
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,235
Why are you talking to him?

5
00:00:07,335 --> 00:00:09,815
It's okay, all right?
It didn't have anything to do with you.

6
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:12,944
He's my father...
it has everything to do with me.

7
00:00:13,044 --> 00:00:16,554
Jonah agrees to leave town
and not come back.

8
00:00:16,654 --> 00:00:17,655
Exile.

9
00:00:17,755 --> 00:00:19,413
Johnston, you SOB.

10
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:21,146
How the hell did you lose an election?

11
00:00:21,246 --> 00:00:23,868
No, the question is how did you get
to be in charge of New Bern?

12
00:00:23,968 --> 00:00:25,620
They get tired of you
being the sheriff?

13
00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:28,075
No, I m still sheriff.
Just got a little more authority.

14
00:00:28,175 --> 00:00:30,128
Does this thing work?
Can we get power from it?

15
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,289
Probably sometime tomorrow.

16
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:32,941
All right, let's get it up
as fast as we can.

17
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,224
Can we bust some more
of these things?

18
00:00:34,324 --> 00:00:36,887
You got one of the only salt mines
around for 400 miles.

19
00:00:36,993 --> 00:00:38,002
We're going to need food.

20
00:00:38,102 --> 00:00:40,015
Ten wind turbines for, let's say...

21
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,502
ten percent of your spring crop.

22
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:43,369
Okay, look, we'll give you the food.

23
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,031
We're going to need ten Jericho men
to help us build them.

24
00:00:46,476 --> 00:00:48,368
I didn't know you guys
were coming back today.

25
00:00:48,456 --> 00:00:49,901
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.

26
00:00:49,954 --> 00:00:52,384
- Where's my brother?
- He hasn't been seen for a few days.

27
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:55,467
You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china.

28
00:00:55,994 --> 00:00:58,095
It's a full inventory of Jericho.

29
00:00:58,195 --> 00:00:59,918
They sliced it up like they own it.

30
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,514
They're making mortar rounds.

31
00:01:01,614 --> 00:01:03,015
They're getting ready for war.

32
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,133
Hold it!

33
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:06,086
There was going to be
an explosion in town.

34
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,109
Hopefully, we can somehow
get Jake and Eric out of there.

35
00:01:17,038 --> 00:01:18,058
Everybody, go!

36
00:01:31,252 --> 00:01:32,931
All right, keep alert.
Jake said the New Bern guys

37
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:34,552
might be coming right behind them.

38
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:38,692
Maybe they're already here.

39
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:43,980
What is that?

40
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,401
What happened?

41
00:01:59,964 --> 00:02:01,560
We got a major problem, Gray.

42
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:04,407
Where's Eric?

43
00:02:04,532 --> 00:02:06,863
He's fine.
He's at the med center.

44
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:11,753
Well, is it about the mine?

45
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:15,586
It's a lot worse than that.

46
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:27,832
Who are you?

47
00:02:31,198 --> 00:02:32,622
Stop moving.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,001
You hear me?

49
00:02:36,705 --> 00:02:37,753
I'm talking to you.

50
00:02:38,285 --> 00:02:39,286
Freeze!

51
00:02:55,138 --> 00:02:56,343
Who are you?

52
00:03:00,192 --> 00:03:01,522
I think we killed...

53
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:03,797
six in New Bern.

54
00:03:06,597 --> 00:03:07,661
I counted eight.

55
00:03:18,714 --> 00:03:19,716
Who's this?

56
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:21,786
Says he's from New Bern.

57
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:23,507
Wanted to talk to you.

58
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:24,994
What is this about?

59
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:49,060
<i>Am I speaking to Gray Anderson?

60
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:54,620
<i>This is Phil Constantino.

61
00:03:57,499 --> 00:03:59,768
<i>Henry, you can
come home now, son.

62
00:04:04,487 --> 00:04:06,458
<i>We're still cleaning the blood
of eight deputies

63
00:04:06,558 --> 00:04:08,166
<i>off the sidewalks of New Bern,

64
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:11,358
<i>so you need to understand
our position.

65
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:15,148
<i>We need seven farms,

66
00:04:15,445 --> 00:04:17,245
<i>including the Jackson farm,

67
00:04:17,354 --> 00:04:18,481
<i>the Herbert farm,

68
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,170
<i>and the Richmond farm.

69
00:04:21,672 --> 00:04:23,601
And we need half the salt mine.

70
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:25,964
You have four hours to respond.

71
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,765
I don't understand.
What are you asking us to do?

72
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:32,866
Jericho is about to be invaded.

73
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:34,916
For the sake of your people,

74
00:04:35,213 --> 00:04:36,605
I'm asking you...

75
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:37,966
to surrender.

80
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:58,548
We have border patrol on duty
at all the checkpoints

81
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:59,724
and all the new roadblocks,

82
00:04:59,742 --> 00:05:01,495
but we're scrambling
to cover everywhere else.

83
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:03,528
- Did you see anything out there?
- No, nothing.

84
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:05,390
What is he actually going to do?

85
00:05:05,504 --> 00:05:07,272
Just march in here and
start shooting us?

86
00:05:07,397 --> 00:05:10,077
We were high school football rivals
five months ago.

87
00:05:10,078 --> 00:05:13,128
They tortured my brother to find out
how many troops we have, what weapons.

88
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:15,131
They have made hundreds of mortars.

89
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,438
My guess says they can hit
from as far as...

90
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:18,721
two miles out.

91
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:22,378
Having them and using them on people
are two different things.

92
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,107
That's what they said
about nuclear bombs.

93
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:31,738
How much time left?

94
00:05:31,926 --> 00:05:33,037
50 minutes.

95
00:05:57,512 --> 00:06:00,141
<i>Haven't been able to get a pulse
from this baby for an hour.

96
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:02,159
<i>Respiration is 16, pulse is 84.

97
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:04,755
<i>Fetal heart rate is less than
five beats per minute.

98
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,071
Just hold the pressure.
Put pressure right there,

99
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:08,589
right there.
Press.

100
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:09,950
Harder. Damn it!

101
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,937
- I can't hear anything.
- What is going on?

102
00:06:12,047 --> 00:06:13,892
- I am trying to save April.
-<i> The baby's heart has stopped.

103
00:06:14,002 --> 00:06:16,020
- What do you mean it's stopped?
- Do something.

104
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:18,567
Oh, Mom.

105
00:06:22,697 --> 00:06:23,699
Oh, God.

106
00:06:30,428 --> 00:06:31,429
Come on.

107
00:06:32,962 --> 00:06:34,996
Come on.
Let's get you fixed up, okay?

108
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,858
Come on, sweetheart.

109
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:41,078
We're not going to give anything
to these people.

110
00:06:43,065 --> 00:06:44,066
Mrs. Herbert?

111
00:06:44,206 --> 00:06:46,835
I just wanted to offer the town
a solution.

112
00:06:46,944 --> 00:06:48,665
You cannot give away that farm.

113
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:52,319
Gray said it's too far out of town
for the rangers to help.

114
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:54,419
I can't stand out there with a rifle.

115
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:58,356
- Then I'll defend it.
- Really?

116
00:06:58,841 --> 00:07:00,327
Are you abandoning it?

117
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:06,163
The bank owns half of that farm anyway.
You just...

118
00:07:06,984 --> 00:07:08,783
do whatever you want, Dale.

119
00:07:09,644 --> 00:07:10,958
Wait, let's be clear.

120
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:13,508
If I defend it, then it's all mine.

121
00:07:14,549 --> 00:07:15,738
If you can defend it.

122
00:07:19,562 --> 00:07:22,003
Dale, how are we going
to defend that farm?

123
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,294
Get me every refugee you can find.

124
00:07:31,607 --> 00:07:32,608
All right.

125
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,432
Careful.

126
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:02,584
I was so scared.

127
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,810
When you didn't come back, I thought...

128
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,913
I'm back.

129
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:12,216
Oh, God!

130
00:08:13,421 --> 00:08:16,503
I'm sorry.
I don't want to hurt you.

131
00:08:20,155 --> 00:08:21,156
I'm okay.

132
00:08:27,243 --> 00:08:28,572
Listen up! Guys!

133
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,060
They said you had some food here.

134
00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:33,575
Yeah... I do have food.

135
00:08:33,685 --> 00:08:36,751
As of this morning, I own
the second biggest farm in Jericho.

136
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:37,894
Now...

137
00:08:37,924 --> 00:08:39,973
I'm going to need men to defend it
if we're invaded.

138
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:41,015
What do we get?

139
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:42,562
The promise of three meals a day.

140
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:45,178
You want us to risk our lives
for a promise?

141
00:08:45,945 --> 00:08:47,103
No way.

142
00:08:49,356 --> 00:08:51,358
Guys, listen, listen!

143
00:08:51,937 --> 00:08:54,972
Since you've been here, you've been
asking for a place to live, food.

144
00:08:55,115 --> 00:08:57,446
You came here as refugees,
and you're still being treated

145
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,177
like second-class citizens.

146
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:00,976
That's no way to live.

147
00:09:03,624 --> 00:09:05,327
If you fight for my farm and we win,

148
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:06,972
then everybody gets an equal split

149
00:09:07,786 --> 00:09:08,991
It'll be your farm.

150
00:09:09,223 --> 00:09:10,503
You'll have a stake in this town

151
00:09:10,603 --> 00:09:12,292
that nobody can take away from you.

152
00:09:14,558 --> 00:09:17,726
You'll never have to ask anyone
for anything ever again.

153
00:09:20,013 --> 00:09:21,014
So...

154
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:23,236
who wants a future?

155
00:09:35,544 --> 00:09:37,390
Constantin said four hours.

156
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,919
It's already been four hours.

157
00:10:05,924 --> 00:10:06,957
You okay?

158
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:10,540
Come here.

159
00:10:15,212 --> 00:10:16,729
What do we hear from the rangers?

160
00:10:16,854 --> 00:10:18,685
Runners came in.
They haven't seen anything.

161
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,328
Should we call Constantino?

162
00:10:21,848 --> 00:10:23,741
I don't have anything to tell him.

163
00:10:25,587 --> 00:10:28,090
And I'm not just going
to give the town away.

164
00:10:30,382 --> 00:10:32,432
There's something I need to tell you.

165
00:10:32,518 --> 00:10:35,224
It's crazy. Everybody's saying
that New Bern's going to attack us.

166
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:36,531
We don't know. Look...

167
00:10:38,585 --> 00:10:40,243
Something happened to Heather.

168
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:42,712
She found out New Bern
was building mortars.

169
00:10:42,812 --> 00:10:44,499
She tried to stop them and they...

170
00:10:44,968 --> 00:10:47,299
they caught her.
Nobody's seen her since.

171
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,175
- What did they do to her?
- I don't know.

172
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:56,385
Is she dead?

173
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:00,001
Jake, is she dead?

174
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,575
Get away from the windows!

175
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:15,532
Are you hurt?

176
00:11:15,735 --> 00:11:17,644
- Are you hurt?
- I'm good. I'm good.

177
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:19,803
Wait here.

178
00:11:35,873 --> 00:11:36,874
Are you okay?

179
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:38,767
Somebody help!

180
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:41,053
Mom.

181
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:43,979
Mom!

182
00:11:49,521 --> 00:11:50,617
Cover your eyes!

183
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:10,332
Jake, you okay?

184
00:12:10,787 --> 00:12:11,798
Honey?

185
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:13,648
- Mom.
- Sweetheart, look at me.

186
00:12:13,748 --> 00:12:15,228
- Look at me.
- I can't hear.

187
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:16,908
I know, sweetie.
That'll come back.

188
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:18,819
- We're right here, Mom.
- What's happening?

189
00:12:18,928 --> 00:12:21,294
It's all right, sweetie.
Everything's going to be fine.

190
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,065
Let's get you to the med center,
honey.

191
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:26,229
Come on.

192
00:12:27,512 --> 00:12:28,683
Get everybody off the street.

193
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:30,221
There might be more coming.

194
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,982
We got to open the shelters
and the town hall

195
00:12:33,082 --> 00:12:35,046
and the medical center...
Move!

196
00:12:36,342 --> 00:12:37,348
Constantino.

197
00:12:37,993 --> 00:12:39,487
He's on the radio.

198
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,676
Constantino, you son of a bitch,

199
00:12:43,776 --> 00:12:44,931
what the hell are you doing?

200
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,730
<i>I'm sorry for your troubles.

201
00:12:47,236 --> 00:12:50,037
We got a dozen injured people
on the street here.

202
00:12:50,178 --> 00:12:53,067
<i>I warned you what would happen
if you didn't meet our demands.

203
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:54,179
Demands?

204
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:57,934
I will make it my,
my purpose in life

205
00:12:58,036 --> 00:13:00,617
to see that you are held accountable
for what you've just done.

206
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,084
<i>Take another hour...

207
00:13:02,184 --> 00:13:04,325
Do not fire any more
of those things in here!

208
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,015
<i>One hour, Gray.

209
00:13:06,141 --> 00:13:07,799
<i>We need seven farms.

210
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,494
<i>It was just two mortars this time.

211
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:11,233
<i>Next time there'll be three.

212
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:14,098
Try to retaliate,
or refuse our demands,

213
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:15,389
we'll send more.

214
00:13:15,624 --> 00:13:19,175
We'll do this day and night
for as long as it takes.

215
00:13:24,924 --> 00:13:27,834
The patrols said that it looked like
they were fired from the west.

216
00:13:27,944 --> 00:13:30,600
Get as many rangers as you can,
all right, go out there,

217
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,560
find those mortars.
And we are gonna take them out!

218
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:35,837
Move!

219
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:50,010
Come on.

220
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:53,323
- Darcy, are you okay ?
- Yeah, but what happened ?

221
00:13:53,423 --> 00:13:55,013
It's New Bern.
They're firing mortars at us.

222
00:13:55,113 --> 00:13:57,363
- Are you okay?
- Yeah!

223
00:13:57,491 --> 00:14:00,072
Look, we've got to get the kids
and you got to get out of here.

224
00:14:00,276 --> 00:14:02,150
Where are we going to go?

225
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,923
There's a safe house I know of.
If we could just get there.

226
00:14:05,454 --> 00:14:06,863
It's in Montana.

227
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:08,935
Go to Montana on these roads?

228
00:14:09,592 --> 00:14:11,360
What are our chances
of getting there?

229
00:14:11,505 --> 00:14:13,429
I don't know.

230
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:20,552
- You heard from Constantino?
- No, no, but I...

231
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,227
sent out a squad of rangers
to try to take out the mortars.

232
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,914
I should have been with them.

233
00:14:25,014 --> 00:14:26,982
You weren't here,
and I couldn't wait.

234
00:14:30,322 --> 00:14:31,824
What should we do?

235
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,639
I don't know.

236
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,822
We've got to get underground, now.

237
00:14:42,651 --> 00:14:43,840
Everybody!

238
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,725
You have got to get underground.

239
00:14:45,826 --> 00:14:48,251
You, get everybody underground.

240
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:50,817
Let's go home.

241
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:53,256
Let's go home.

242
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,102
Okay.

243
00:15:06,927 --> 00:15:08,695
I have to get back to town.

244
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:11,785
Sam, get away fromhere.

245
00:15:13,991 --> 00:15:17,081
Dad, there's more water in the garage.
You want me to get it?

246
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:19,474
That is the safest room
in the house.

247
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:21,962
It's concrete, rebar, reinforced.

248
00:15:23,327 --> 00:15:24,939
That's where we should be, D.

249
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:27,082
Come on.

250
00:15:34,412 --> 00:15:35,742
Come on in.

251
00:15:36,763 --> 00:15:38,390
This is cool!

252
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,267
Sam, Allison, go in the other room.

253
00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:58,271
- Why can't...
- Come on, Sam. Let's go.

254
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,579
But this room's boring.

255
00:16:04,122 --> 00:16:05,452
No more secrets.

256
00:16:09,121 --> 00:16:11,327
Those mortars didn't come
from very far off.

257
00:16:11,468 --> 00:16:14,519
- How much time do we have?
- About four minutes left.

258
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:17,709
<i>This is Stanley Richmond.
Mayor Anderson, can you hear me?

259
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:19,129
- We hear you.
- <i>Okay,

260
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,511
<i>we're about 100 yards away
from the mortar cannons.

261
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:24,084
<i>There's two of them,
sitting on the back of a flatbed truck.

262
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:25,649
Where are you, Stanley?

263
00:16:26,462 --> 00:16:28,715
<i>We're in the woods
by the old </i>Shaw Creek Bridge,

264
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,382
<i>about two miles west of town.

265
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:32,498
<i>There's out ten men
guarding the truck.

266
00:16:32,598 --> 00:16:35,341
- <i>They're arked in a clearing.</i>
- Can you get to them?

267
00:16:35,623 --> 00:16:38,267
<i>Yeah, I think so. There's a path
leading into the clearing.

268
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:40,524
Tell him he's got to send scouts out
on both flanks.

269
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,682
There's no time to reposition.

270
00:16:41,782 --> 00:16:43,507
They have to know
what they're going into.

271
00:16:43,597 --> 00:16:45,752
I'm not gonna give them
another chance to drop bombs on us.

272
00:16:45,852 --> 00:16:47,084
Gray, these men are not soldiers...

273
00:16:47,184 --> 00:16:51,405
Johnston, you can stay or you can go,
but how this happens is my call.

274
00:16:51,538 --> 00:16:53,838
- Stanley, get out of there. Don't do!
- Let go!

275
00:17:02,163 --> 00:17:03,665
<i>What should we do?

276
00:17:08,186 --> 00:17:09,813
Take 'em out.

277
00:17:12,023 --> 00:17:13,275
<i>Got it.

278
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:27,458
So why now?

279
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,629
You know I always thought
that I could keep you safe.

280
00:17:32,864 --> 00:17:34,616
But now, uh, today...

281
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,596
I'm just not so sure.

282
00:17:40,264 --> 00:17:41,594
Nothing is safe.

283
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,471
Not anymore.

284
00:17:43,768 --> 00:17:45,130
But, you know, in...

285
00:17:47,508 --> 00:17:49,229
in the middle of all of this...

286
00:17:50,915 --> 00:17:52,120
in this madness...

287
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,718
the only thing that make sense to me,
I mean really, the...

288
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,189
only thing...

289
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:00,099
is you and the kids.

290
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:05,783
It took me a while to realize
that and I'm...

291
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:07,566
sorry.
I am...

292
00:18:08,677 --> 00:18:09,682
so sorry.

293
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:20,976
I missed you.

294
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,139
I missed you.

295
00:18:59,324 --> 00:19:00,873
How do we know if it worked?

296
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:10,019
Come on.

297
00:19:49,052 --> 00:19:50,124
Is he shot?

298
00:19:54,824 --> 00:19:56,385
Sit down. Sit down.

299
00:19:59,003 --> 00:20:00,651
Get him to the med center.

300
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:02,458
Is he all right?

301
00:20:02,674 --> 00:20:03,683
Are you shot?

302
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:04,856
Where's everybody else?

303
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:06,628
Stanley, what happened out there?

304
00:20:06,815 --> 00:20:07,976
I don't know.

305
00:20:08,152 --> 00:20:10,169
We were moving
towards the mortar truck

306
00:20:10,785 --> 00:20:11,934
and they were waiting,

307
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:14,754
they were waiting
on both sides of it for us.

308
00:20:17,964 --> 00:20:20,416
They wouldn't...
they wouldn't stop firing.

309
00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:22,363
Stanley, where's everybody else?

310
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:23,923
Where are they, son?

311
00:20:27,336 --> 00:20:28,357
They're...

312
00:20:28,506 --> 00:20:29,772
they're all dead.

313
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:35,379
They're all dead.

314
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,384
This is insane.

315
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:47,428
This is insane!

316
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:48,613
You son of a bitch!

317
00:20:49,024 --> 00:20:50,079
Back off. Hold on.

318
00:20:50,302 --> 00:20:51,827
Hold on.

319
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,499
Bailey's... now.

320
00:21:05,694 --> 00:21:07,923
Stanley said the mortars were
on trucks here,

321
00:21:08,146 --> 00:21:10,328
right here, just east
of Shaw Creek Bridge.

322
00:21:10,492 --> 00:21:11,879
They're going to fire and move.

323
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:14,272
Check the tracks, see which
direction they were headed.

324
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:15,703
And Jake, just scout them.

325
00:21:15,832 --> 00:21:17,966
We're not not going to do
anything else half-cocked.

326
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:20,922
First, we find 'em, then
we'll formulate a plan of attack.

327
00:21:21,122 --> 00:21:22,131
Got it.

328
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:23,556
Just scout 'em.

329
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:26,154
I'm coming with you.

330
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,145
It was not a request.

331
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:36,975
All right.

332
00:21:40,576 --> 00:21:42,793
From the tracks, I'd say three,

333
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:45,373
maybe four trucks
headed down that fire road.

334
00:21:45,561 --> 00:21:48,904
They could hit the town from anywhere
once they get to Route 6.

335
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:57,053
Hawkins spotted a five-ton truck
coming this way from New Bern

336
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:58,331
about three miles back

337
00:21:58,496 --> 00:22:01,630
Could be a supply truck
heading to the next mortar site.

338
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,805
We can get it.

339
00:22:06,498 --> 00:22:08,198
All right. Let's go.

340
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,745
Stop the truck now!
Stop it!

341
00:23:35,316 --> 00:23:36,337
They're all right.

342
00:23:36,661 --> 00:23:37,799
Let 'em go.

343
00:23:43,084 --> 00:23:45,496
You two finally turned to
a life of crime.

344
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:55,203
We're going to need
your men, Dale.

345
00:23:55,391 --> 00:23:57,179
My men don't fight for
Gray Anderson.

346
00:23:57,426 --> 00:23:59,690
We're asking you
to help defend the town.

347
00:24:00,464 --> 00:24:02,423
We lose, you don't have anything.

348
00:24:04,522 --> 00:24:07,285
If we fight with you,
we keep Mrs. Herbert's farm.

349
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:10,328
And we get the abandoned
Surrey farm also.

350
00:24:11,508 --> 00:24:12,986
You already own half a salt mine,

351
00:24:13,209 --> 00:24:15,825
and a percentage of every farm
in the county. Now you want more?

352
00:24:16,025 --> 00:24:18,769
- It's just business.
- This isn't about business.

353
00:24:20,365 --> 00:24:22,312
I'm asking you to do this for me.

354
00:24:36,811 --> 00:24:38,101
We need your help.

355
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,881
Let's get ready to move.
They'll be looking for this truck.

356
00:24:41,074 --> 00:24:43,608
Last time I was in town,
those people were trying to lynch me.

357
00:24:43,766 --> 00:24:44,963
They can all go to hell.

358
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,546
Just listen to me.

359
00:24:46,906 --> 00:24:48,654
No, you listen to me.

360
00:24:48,818 --> 00:24:50,542
I've been watching New Bern
moving weapons

361
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:52,748
and supplies around here
for the last three days.

362
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:54,314
This is going to be a bloodbath.

363
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:56,507
The best thing you can do
is come with me.

364
00:24:57,293 --> 00:24:58,624
Jericho's my home.

365
00:24:59,188 --> 00:25:00,642
And I'm your father.

366
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,015
It's survival of the fastest
and strongest out here.

367
00:25:04,307 --> 00:25:06,307
You think I'm safer with you,
robbing trucks?

368
00:25:06,483 --> 00:25:07,586
I haven't lost a man yet.

369
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:10,846
And if New Bern doesn't get Jericho,
somebody else will.

370
00:25:13,098 --> 00:25:14,154
Come with me.

371
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:21,106
Give us the maps,

372
00:25:21,334 --> 00:25:23,838
help us take out the mortars,
help us fight.

373
00:25:24,894 --> 00:25:25,926
We'll give you half.

374
00:25:26,084 --> 00:25:28,219
Half of all weapons,
food and fuel that we take.

375
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,016
And if New Bern's army's as
big as you say it is,

376
00:25:31,186 --> 00:25:32,465
you'll do whole lot better than

377
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:34,910
hitting one truck at a time out here.

378
00:25:39,629 --> 00:25:42,714
You got more of me in you
than you're ever going to admit.

379
00:25:47,394 --> 00:25:48,643
Change of plans!

380
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:52,678
When the federal government
comes back, we have our deeds.

381
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,274
We get our farms back then.

382
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:56,333
What if the government
doesn't come back?

383
00:25:56,603 --> 00:25:58,303
What if this is the way it stays?

384
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,849
But they are coming here
intent on killing us.

385
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:03,230
Gray says we're only
three farms away from a deal.

386
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,013
And besides,
we're not prepared to fight.

387
00:26:05,118 --> 00:26:07,523
I will get us prepared.
You talk to those farmers,

388
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:08,942
you don't let them give in.

389
00:26:09,158 --> 00:26:11,281
Who else you got willing
to fight, Johnston?

390
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:13,345
The cops?
The rangers?

391
00:26:14,175 --> 00:26:15,195
Dad?

392
00:26:28,432 --> 00:26:31,130
There are 11 potential mortar sites.

393
00:26:31,722 --> 00:26:33,787
Question is, which one is next?

394
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,539
Driver said... this one.

395
00:26:37,143 --> 00:26:38,175
If we can trust him.

396
00:26:38,756 --> 00:26:39,940
How were the trucks guarded?

397
00:26:40,257 --> 00:26:43,271
- They have men hidden in the brush.
- I'm not sure I'm taking your deal.

398
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:46,083
They have nearly 30 guys guarding
that mortar truck.

399
00:26:46,388 --> 00:26:47,644
I see nine here.

400
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:52,465
Gray's got the seven farmers he needs.

401
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:54,770
He's going to call New Bern
and give them up.

402
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:58,509
Surrenders those farms,
New Bern will occupy them in 30 minutes.

403
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:00,151
We'll never get rid of them.

404
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,104
So, what do we do?

405
00:27:03,629 --> 00:27:05,810
I guess I'm about to make
a deal with the devil.

406
00:27:08,021 --> 00:27:09,253
You flatter me.

407
00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:13,425
get back over to town hall,
do whatever it takes,

408
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:15,172
but don't let Gray make that call.

409
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,365
What do you mean, do whatever
it takes? What are you saying?

410
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:19,629
I'm saying it's time to pick a side.

411
00:27:35,093 --> 00:27:36,261
Why'd you bring Grey in here?

412
00:27:36,326 --> 00:27:38,771
They just want to talk
to you for a second.

413
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:42,101
Don't make that deal
with Constantino.

414
00:27:42,338 --> 00:27:43,429
It's not a debate.

415
00:27:43,604 --> 00:27:46,684
If you make this deal, they're not
going to stop with seven farms.

416
00:27:47,052 --> 00:27:48,777
People are going to starve
to death, Gray.

417
00:27:48,988 --> 00:27:51,756
And that's if they don't kill us
outright when the food gets scarce.

418
00:27:51,991 --> 00:27:53,070
I need you to leave.

419
00:27:53,231 --> 00:27:54,838
- Now!
- Come on, Gray.

420
00:27:55,624 --> 00:27:57,348
Why are you so ready to give up?

421
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,236
I almost gave my life
for this town, Gray.

422
00:27:59,342 --> 00:28:00,960
You better listen to me,
you understand?

423
00:28:01,124 --> 00:28:03,799
- It wasn't your fault those men died.
- Get 'em out of here!

424
00:28:03,977 --> 00:28:05,068
Get them out of here!

425
00:28:05,174 --> 00:28:07,027
You're going to listen
to what I have to say.

426
00:28:07,156 --> 00:28:08,188
It's not your fault.

427
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,529
Calm down!

428
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:13,784
Put 'em down!

429
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,696
Put 'em down!

430
00:28:27,062 --> 00:28:28,424
We have men out there, Gray.

431
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,632
What?

432
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:30,760
We have men out there.

433
00:28:30,822 --> 00:28:31,854
Put 'em down!

434
00:28:31,886 --> 00:28:33,452
- Brooks, put 'em down!
- You, too. Put 'em down..

435
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:34,578
Who is out there ?

436
00:28:34,674 --> 00:28:36,443
Who is out there and
what are they doing?

437
00:28:36,602 --> 00:28:38,115
Jake, Hawkins, my dad.

438
00:28:38,221 --> 00:28:40,284
And they're going to try
and take out the mortars.

439
00:28:41,455 --> 00:28:43,418
The three of them?
What do they think they're going to do?

440
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,235
You cannot give up those farms.

441
00:28:45,328 --> 00:28:46,969
- Do you understand?
- We can't fight!

442
00:28:47,613 --> 00:28:48,755
We can't fight.

443
00:28:49,001 --> 00:28:51,256
You saw what happened this morning.

444
00:28:51,983 --> 00:28:53,682
We're not ready for this.

445
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,367
I have been talking to Constantino,

446
00:28:58,251 --> 00:29:00,736
and I promised him that
we will not retaliate

447
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,180
if he just gives us time
to put this deal together.

448
00:29:03,403 --> 00:29:05,336
We've got maps of all
of New Bern's positions.

449
00:29:05,442 --> 00:29:07,411
- Supply line, everything.
- Where did you get this stuff?

450
00:29:07,598 --> 00:29:09,719
We've got trucks. We've got fuel.
We've got guns.

451
00:29:09,988 --> 00:29:12,233
What are you talking about?
Where did you get all this?

452
00:29:12,374 --> 00:29:14,337
Jonah Prowse is fighting with us.

453
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,970
He's got about 30 men
fighting with him. 30 men!

454
00:29:18,597 --> 00:29:20,343
Well, they can get us all killed.

455
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:23,585
<i>This is New Bern. Over.

456
00:29:25,588 --> 00:29:27,029
Don't go near that radio, Gray.

457
00:29:27,451 --> 00:29:29,537
<i>Mayor Anderson, are you there?

458
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,209
Johnston Green, right?

459
00:29:44,353 --> 00:29:47,728
Two years ago,  you came over
to New Bern and finished fourth

460
00:29:48,005 --> 00:29:50,583
in a bass fishing contest
up at Big Hill Lake.

461
00:29:52,845 --> 00:29:54,357
I finished second.

462
00:30:07,754 --> 00:30:09,090
Let's go.

463
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,683
<i>Mayor Anderson,
your time is running out.

464
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:18,613
She tried to tell Constantino
that I did not send them out there.

465
00:30:18,847 --> 00:30:20,992
Gray, don't make that deal.

466
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:23,308
Buy some time to take out those mortars.

467
00:30:24,808 --> 00:30:26,343
Negotiate with Constantino.

468
00:30:34,578 --> 00:30:36,254
So, we pop out of here,

469
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:40,039
it gets bad, Jonah going
will have our backs, right?

470
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:43,695
You are filling me
with confidence, Jake.

471
00:30:44,492 --> 00:30:46,424
Emily's with him.
He'll be there.

472
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:51,272
<i>Mayor Anderson, are you there?

473
00:30:52,866 --> 00:30:54,307
Yeah, I'm here, Phil.

474
00:30:54,863 --> 00:30:56,304
<i>What's your decision?

475
00:30:56,937 --> 00:30:58,472
You're a good businessman, Gray.

476
00:30:59,614 --> 00:31:01,119
You know how to do it.

477
00:31:04,014 --> 00:31:05,813
Well, we don't want to fight.

478
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,180
So,

479
00:31:08,948 --> 00:31:11,491
what about the... Levine

480
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:17,175
and Hides Dairy farms,
in-instead of the Richmond farm?

481
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,843
<i>That's less acreage.

482
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:28,874
Yeah, I know, but...

483
00:31:29,383 --> 00:31:32,829
then you would have a dairy
and a soybean farm,

484
00:31:33,122 --> 00:31:35,688
and also Hides has 50 acres of corn,

485
00:31:35,942 --> 00:31:40,132
and I got to tell you, that deal would
be a lot easier to sell to my people.

486
00:32:16,502 --> 00:32:17,557
Where you been?

487
00:32:17,733 --> 00:32:19,233
Supposed to be here three hours ago.

488
00:32:19,385 --> 00:32:21,201
I got sniped at by
a gang over near Calvert.

489
00:32:21,377 --> 00:32:25,180
Had to come all the way back around
through... back through Van Ness.

490
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,156
Got a half a barbecued venison in back.

491
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:30,387
You're kidding?

492
00:32:30,797 --> 00:32:31,969
God, we need it.

493
00:32:34,758 --> 00:32:35,895
We got chow!

494
00:32:49,604 --> 00:32:50,788
We'll eat in shifts.

495
00:32:51,028 --> 00:32:53,319
Don't pull everybody off
the perimeter at the same time.

496
00:32:56,619 --> 00:32:57,756
Don't move.

497
00:32:58,822 --> 00:33:00,305
And drop your weapons.

498
00:33:02,027 --> 00:33:03,427
Get in the truck.
Move!

499
00:33:06,388 --> 00:33:08,673
<i>My people are telling me
that all the cattle out

500
00:33:08,884 --> 00:33:10,935
<i>at Hides farm have been
slaughtered for food.

501
00:33:11,104 --> 00:33:13,870
Really?
I don't think so, but

502
00:33:14,057 --> 00:33:15,686
I can find out for you.

503
00:33:16,031 --> 00:33:18,082
Let's talk about the salt mine now.

504
00:33:18,404 --> 00:33:22,247
You've already got 25% of the mine.
Can't we just leave it at that?

505
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,531
<i>What are you doing, Gray?

506
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,570
What are you talking about?

507
00:33:28,781 --> 00:33:30,398
<i>This negotiation is over.

508
00:33:31,488 --> 00:33:33,117
No, Phil, come on.

509
00:33:33,954 --> 00:33:36,697
<i>30 seconds, Gray,
or I send more mortars.

510
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,902
We almost have a deal here, Phil.
Come on!

511
00:33:57,174 --> 00:33:58,229
They're here!

512
00:33:58,452 --> 00:33:59,659
They're in the camp!

513
00:34:00,784 --> 00:34:02,260
I'm closing the camp!

514
00:34:02,483 --> 00:34:03,971
Come on. Get up there!

515
00:34:46,236 --> 00:34:47,830
Where the hell is Jonah?

516
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,275
He doesn't want to get hit
in our crossfire.

517
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:52,887
Cease fire!

518
00:34:53,766 --> 00:34:54,774
Cease fire!

519
00:34:54,962 --> 00:34:56,016
Stop!

520
00:36:56,376 --> 00:36:58,381
This one's yours.
Meet you back at the camp.

521
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:00,816
Wait.
What are you talking about?

522
00:37:01,124 --> 00:37:02,143
Deal's changed.

523
00:37:02,374 --> 00:37:03,682
The hell it has.

524
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:06,142
It's a new split:

525
00:37:06,318 --> 00:37:09,710
I get all the weapons, the food,
the fuel, the guns, everything.

526
00:37:09,968 --> 00:37:11,622
- Deal's 50-50.
- And what do we get?

527
00:37:11,774 --> 00:37:13,698
You get to have bombs
not falling on your head.

528
00:37:13,874 --> 00:37:14,894
Listen here, Jonah...

529
00:37:15,516 --> 00:37:17,182
This is about to get a lot worse.

530
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,953
We need those guns!

531
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:20,771
Why are you doing this?

532
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,976
You owe me a lot more than that!

533
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:25,142
I am a thief, not a soldier.

534
00:37:25,975 --> 00:37:27,723
You promised you'd help us.

535
00:37:27,969 --> 00:37:29,823
Look, you shouldn't be near me.

536
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:32,902
You're a schoolteacher, kid.
A schoolteacher.

537
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:37,047
Go on.

538
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,187
We're just gonna let him go?
We need those guns.

539
00:37:58,457 --> 00:37:59,466
Guns.

540
00:38:02,556 --> 00:38:03,740
Guns are easy.

541
00:38:37,331 --> 00:38:40,451
You had this the whole time
and you didn't say anything?

542
00:38:42,207 --> 00:38:45,439
I never thought I was gonna call
this town my home.

543
00:38:48,274 --> 00:38:49,881
Let's get them loaded up.

544
00:38:56,306 --> 00:38:57,705
What's he doing?

545
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,576
Why hasn't he fired the mortars?

546
00:39:01,763 --> 00:39:02,807
Did we take them out?

547
00:39:02,995 --> 00:39:05,177
He would have come back
on the radio.

548
00:39:14,851 --> 00:39:16,412
We took out the mortars.

549
00:39:19,963 --> 00:39:21,018
Hell, yeah.

550
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,508
<i>Are you there?

551
00:39:39,306 --> 00:39:41,465
<i>Now, you've brought this on yourself.

552
00:39:41,817 --> 00:39:44,104
<i>There's no deals, no mercy.

553
00:39:44,866 --> 00:39:45,922
<i>We're coming.

554
00:39:46,561 --> 00:39:48,098
<i>This means war.

555
00:39:49,716 --> 00:39:51,405
<i>Do you hear me, Gray?

556
00:40:03,228 --> 00:40:04,506
I need your help.

557
00:40:19,499 --> 00:40:21,540
Stanley, get me every
runner you can find.

558
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:24,367
I want to get orders out
to all the patrols.

559
00:41:18,093 --> 00:41:20,767
Most of you have no idea what to do

560
00:41:21,782 --> 00:41:23,283
or what's coming.

561
00:41:26,338 --> 00:41:27,711
Some of you do.

562
00:41:32,763 --> 00:41:35,261
This isn't a fight about land

563
00:41:35,801 --> 00:41:37,830
or about this town.

564
00:41:40,047 --> 00:41:42,627
This is a fight for our very existence.

565
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,618
Pray for each other.

566
00:41:51,496 --> 00:41:54,839
While you're at it, pray for the men
and women of New Bern.

567
00:41:56,587 --> 00:41:58,393
Pray that God forgives us.

568
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,349
Every able-bodied person...

569
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,782
who needs a gun...

570
00:42:15,063 --> 00:42:17,432
16 years of age or older...

571
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:20,905
line up.

572
