1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
Previously on jericho

2
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,360
Jake green ! how u doing man ? 

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,760
wait a minute,where the hell u been ? 

4
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:05,940
around

5
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,260
Jake,no one's been around for five years. 

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,800
Seriously,where have you been ? 

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,760
Hey,brother. 

8
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,170
What you put this family through...

9
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,140
johnston,for god's sake. 

10
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,860
Now,he could have been...

11
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,370
we could spend a week talking about 
what I could have been,all right ? 

12
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,800
Stay one more day. 

13
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,660
I've got to get back 
to san diego by tomorrow. 

14
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,470
All right,it looks like the explosion 
came from the west,maybe denver. 

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,740
Are we under attack ? 

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,870
it could've been a test,Could've 
been an accident. 

17
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,640
Hi,dale. 

18
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,590
Sorry I didn't call sooner,angel,but we...

19
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,270
oh,my god ! 

20
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,500
Oh,my god ! 

21
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,670
I am so sorry. 

22
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,850
I didn't know your mother was in denver. 

23
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,540
She was in atlanta. 

24
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,330
Oh,my god ! 

25
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,500
My mom died yesterday. 

26
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,970
I think my mom died yesterday,too. 

27
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,810
Get april. We'll meet you at the medical center. 

28
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,690
There's an empty prison bus out there. 

29
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:54,170
look,I know you're telling people it was an 
accident,but if it was an attack,sheriff...

30
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,610
There's chaos out there,you might not want the 
wrong people knowing that jericho was still here. 

31
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,060
Riley ! 

32
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,200
is there anybody on this channel ? 

33
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,280
There are men here with guns. 

34
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,630
I think they might have killed the sheriff. 

35
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,810
Won't the rain clear 
the radiation out of the air ? 

36
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,730
Yes,and bring it straight down on jericho. 

37
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,600
How do you know about 
radiation,mr. Hawkins ? 

38
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,290
Because I was a cop in st. Louis,
and after 9-11,we got up to speed. 

39
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,960
How long before the radiation gets here ? 

40
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,680
How long does it normally take 
a storm to get here from denver ? 

41
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,660
Less than two hours. 

42
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,010
Everyone over here can go 
to the town hall shelter. 

43
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,420
All those on the north side 
will go to the clinic. 

44
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,640
Our shelter's no good. 

45
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,040
I'm bringing these people to town hall. 

46
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:30,950
They can't come in here,jake. 

47
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,000
What do you mean they can't come in here ? 

48
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,680
We're packed. 

49
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,270
The salt mine,how many people will it hold ? 

50
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,730
We have to seal the entrance. 

51
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,610
There's no door,jake. 

52
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,510
Well,we can't just let 
the rain pour down the shaft. 

53
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,790
These people won't be safe. 

54
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,000
We're all clear. 

55
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,160
what's happening out there ? 

56
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,880
I don't know. 

57
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,520
You always know something. 

58
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,100
You know,don't ask me questions. 

59
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,430
18 hours after the bombs

60
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,270
She's still not talking. 

61
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,950
I get that. 

62
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,560
I mean,I'm a cop. 

63
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,820
I've never killed anybody. 

64
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,940
She's a schoolteacher. 

65
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,750
Where's stanley ? 

66
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,980
Jake,my brother doesn't know about the radiation. 

67
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,420
When the rain stops,he'll be back,don't worry. 

68
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,840
Bonnie,I know stanley. 

69
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,720
He'll be fine. 

70
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,740
Jimmy: Jake,I got your brother. 

71
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,560
He's with your dad. 

72
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,850
Finally. 

73
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,970
Eric,how's dad ? 

74
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,480
He's good. 

75
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,890
The town hall shelter is secure. 

76
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,550
Listen,jake,where are you ? 

77
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,870
I'm at the richmond'S. 

78
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,540
As soon as the rain stops,get every digging 
tool you can find and get to the mine. 

79
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,750
I had to blow the entrance to keep the rain out. 

80
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,630
These people have been sealed up way too long. 

81
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:02,050
And I'm more worried the explosion might 
have put some debris into the ventilator. 

82
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,740
Enough to slow it down ? 

83
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,190
Enough to shut it down. 

84
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,780
We got to get them out. 

85
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,090
We can't reach anyone at the mine. 

86
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,990
We have no radio contact with anyone there. 

87
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,300
Here,honey,take a little sip. 

88
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,710
Okay,just a little. Pass it on. 

89
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,340
Good,you guys,good. 

90
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,030
Good,good,good. 

91
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,390
One second. 

92
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,510
I'll be right back. 

93
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,690
Excuse me. 

94
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,910
How you holding up ? 

95
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,800
Oh,heather. 

96
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,700
I think our students are taking it better than I am. 

97
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,420
They just know there's nothing to be afraid of. 

98
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,930
For them,it's just like a bad field trip. 

99
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,370
I'll be fine. 

100
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,920
Just having a hard time breathing. 

101
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,600
Heather: It's all right. 

102
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,730
Here,take a little water. 

103
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,890
Yeah. 

104
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,830
Good. 

105
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,190
I have to get outside. 

106
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,480
Heather: Soon. 

107
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,070
Soon. 

108
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,660
Is mr. Rennie okay ? 

109
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,890
He's gonna be fine. 

110
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,450
We just need to give him a 
little bit of room,okay ? 

111
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,350
Go on back. 

112
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,150
I can't do this ! 

113
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,320
Got to get outside ! 

114
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:02,850
It's okay. 

115
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,300
Deep breath,deep breatH. 

116
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,610
you doing all right ? 

117
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,430
Stupid question ? 

118
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,540
How do you know the rain's radioactive ? 

119
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,770
Denver's pretty far away. 

120
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,510
Well,we don't know how many bombs 
there were,we don't know...

121
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,220
What is it ? 

122
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,000
Someone's up in the house. 

123
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,050
Not more prisoners ? 

124
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,460
stanley ! 

125
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,230
Bonnie,thank god. 

126
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,020
No ! Hey,hey ! No ! 

127
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,040
Stanley,don't touch her. 

128
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,580
The rain may be radioactive. 

129
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,970
April,stanley seems to be okay. 

130
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,400
I'd say he was in it for about 20 minutes. 

131
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,150
Yeah,I was out at my cousin's,helping him 
put the livestock up and got caught in it. 

132
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,460
Is he vomiting ? 

133
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,530
Jake: No,he's not. 

134
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,640
Okay,do you have any iodine there ? 

135
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,980
Bonnie,iodine ? 

136
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,140
Hey,what's with all the tanks ? 

137
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,730
What tanks ? 

138
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,560
On my way home,I passed a line of tanks. 

139
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,100
They were hauling ass towards denver. 

140
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,010
Stanley,how many tanks did you see ? 

141
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,150
Five,maybe. 

142
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:23,900
Where ? 

143
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,270
They were over the ridge. I couldn't 
tell you exactly where they were. 

144
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,910
But I was on pharr's mill road near I-70. 

145
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,900
April,we have iodine. 

146
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,160
He's going to need to take a couple of tablespoons. 

147
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,860
But it tastes vile,so do you have any 
bread,something that he could take with it ? 

148
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,100
We're in a cellar...all we've got 
is canned peaches and pickles. 

149
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,290
Not the pickles. 

150
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,420
Maybe the peaches. 

151
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,500
Jake,just give me the iodine. 

152
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,460
The second that the rain breaks,
rush him to the clinic. 

153
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,750
And,jake...

154
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,580
if he throws up in the next couple 
of hours,get bonnie out of that room. 

155
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Why ? 

156
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,720
Because her brother's going to die. 

157

YDY proudly presents

159
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,730
Just concentrate on breathing,please. 

160
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,730
I can'T. 

161
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,090
Got to get out of here. 
I know. 

162
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,950
I got to get out of here ! 
Soon. 

163
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,020
Mr. Rennie,please,just concentrate on your breathing. 

164
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,110
Look at me. 

165
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,950
Controlled. 

166
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,310
I got to get out of here. 
I know,mr...

167
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,390
I got to get out of here ! 

168
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,340
I don't want to die down here ! 

169
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,410
Get me out of here ! 

170
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,040
I don't want to be here ! 
Look,everybody just calm down. 

171
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,630
There's nothing to worry about. 

172
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,750
You're scaring the children,scott. 
I can't breathe. 

173
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,140
He's claustrophobic. 

174
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:45,900
We got to get him out of here. 

175
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,110
Look,it's me. 
I'm sorry. 

176
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:47,940
It's sheP. 

177
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,520
Try to focus,man,try to focus. 

178
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,730
I got to get out of here ! 

179
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,440
We got to get him away from these people. 
I got to get out of here ! 

180
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,060
I can't breathe ! 

181
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,460
I don't want to die down here ! 

182
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,080
Please be careful ! 

183
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,210
Please ! 

184
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,500
Stay back. 

185
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,020
I don't want to die down here ! 

186
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,530
jake wants to talk to you. 

187
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,890
His cough's getting much worse. 

188
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,170
I want you to make it brief. 

189
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,130
Okay,okay. 

190
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,710
Yeah,son,what is it ? 

191
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,560
Dad,stanley saw a line of tanks near I-70. 

192
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,650
Well,you know,there's a national guard 
unit to the southwest of there in goodland. 

193
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,560
Maybe they've got a relief effort going. 

194
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,890
We need to get out there and see. 

195
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,990
That could be a dangerous thing to do,son. 

196
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,460
Can't just sit around and wait 
to find out what's happening. 

197
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,450
I'll go to goodland. 

198
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,540
Someone should check out topeka. 

199
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,010
Okay,son. 

200
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,480
I'm going with you. 

201
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,640
What ? 

202
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,090
I have to find roger,and goodland's 
on the way to wichita. 
You're in no condition to...

203
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,250
I'm going. 

204
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,750
With you or I'm going by myself. 

205
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,870
For the last time,you can't smoke here. 

206
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,450
All right,waters for everyone. 

207
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,200
Here you go. 
Thank you,honey. 

208
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,050
Johnston,I need to take your temperature again. 

209
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,800
Oh,you just took it five minutes ago. 

210
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,210
hasn't changed in five minutes. 

211
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,530
The mighty johnston green felled by the flu. 

212
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,380
Here it comes. 

213
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,390
I don't know if I told you this,but 
my father is impervious to mere germs. 

214
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,140
Oh,really ? 

215
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,060
Yeah,I believe that was the quote. 

216
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,890
First inauguration...have it all on video. 

217
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,780
It was a joke. 

218
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,600
I was trying to...

219
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,370
april,don't ever make a mistake. 

220
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,390
This family will never let you forget it. 

221
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,890
Okay,I'll remember that. 

222
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,880
Oh,come on. 
But still...

223
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,660
shh,johnston. 

224
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,980
I don't like him. 

225
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,810
Me neither. 

226
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,210
here. 

227
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,640
They're really stale. 

228
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:47,760
you know,I keep thinking about when we were kids 
and how they used to make us practice hiding 
under our desks in case of an atomic bomb. 

229
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,370
Yeah,duck and cover. 

230
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,740
That's the first thing I thought of 
when I saw that mushroom cloud. 

231
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:00,070
Did they have enough time to 
hide under their desks ? 

232
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,470
That's pretty stupid,huh ? 

233
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,680
No. 

234
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,730
Eric ? 

235
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,630
I'm just a little confused. 

236
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,910
Your wife isn't really acting like someone who 
knows the marriage has been dead a long time. 

237
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,130
Mary...
or did I get the wrong impression ? 

238
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,500
Mary,let's just get through this,okay ? 

239
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:36,750
Well,the next thing you're gonna tell me 
is that she actually does understand you. 

240
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,570
I'm sorry. 

241
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,050
Jake,don't let bonnie see your lips. 

242
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,230
Listen,man. 

243
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,180
If this thing doesn't turn out so good...
the thing is,bonnie's still just a kid,so...

244
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,200
stanley. 

245
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,930
Don't even,all right ? You're gonna be fine. 

246
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,280
I don't know. 

247
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,230
My head is pounding and I feel 
like I'm gonna throw up. 

248
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,790
eric,the rain has stopped. 

249
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,850
Is it okay ? 

250
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,010
what's this black stuff ? 

251
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,480
That used to be denver. 

252
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,670
Bill,emily,get stanley to 
the medical clinic now. 

253
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,100
Okay. 

254
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,430
Find april,she'll know what to do. 

255
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,180
Jimmy,you're coming with me 
to the mine,all right ? 

256
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,330
Jake. 

257
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,550
I meant what I said,all right ? 

258
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,170
I know. 

259
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,270
Look,I know,I know. 

260
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,580
I will help you find roger. 

261
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,810
I promise,okay ? 

262
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,590
Go,I'll meet you at the medical clinic. 

263
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,260
Eric,we're coming to the mine now. 

264
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,420
We have to dig those people out. 

265
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,960
what was that ?  ! 

266
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,380
What was that ?  ! 

267
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,020
I think somebody's on the other side. 

268
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,510
get these people out of here. 

269
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:43,210
all right,everyone,you're gonna be okay. 

270
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,330
All right,we have food and water. 

271
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,450
And there are vehicles waiting for you 
guys to take you to the clinic,all right ? 

272
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,130
Nice and slow. 

273
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,170
File out,these guys'll help you. 

274
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,610
Listen,you're okay. 

275
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,160
Women and children first. 

276
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,160
Please. 

277
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,090
Watch your step,everyone,be careful. 

278
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,930
It's gonna be okay. 

279
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,000
Are you okay ? 

280
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,590
I think so. 

281
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,550
Gray,what happened ? 

282
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,850
He's dead. 

283
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,100
What ? 

284
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,570
Hey,how's stanley ? 

285
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,550
We're still watching him. 

286
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,810
Where is he ? 
We had to isolate him. 

287
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,350
Where ? Where is he ? 

288
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,330
What the hell ? 

289
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,300
Do you like it ? 

290
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,860
It's where they make the contagious kids wait 
so they don't give everybody chicken pox. 

291
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,050
Did you throw up ? 

292
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,140
Yeah,a couple times. 

293
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,520
Apparently,that's what happens when 
you drink a bottle of iodine. 

294
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,580
I need to get back to the house. 

295
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,800
I need to check on the livestock. 

296
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,750
I need to check on the corn. 

297
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,720
I need to get out of here. 

298
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,950
There's really nothing you can do right now. 

299
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,360
He's right. 

300
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,590
You need to stay. 

301
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,100
I'm really sick of being poked 
with needles every ten minutes. 

302
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,820
They'll be sorry when my spider powers kick in. 

303
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,360
Well,you're still an idiot,so that's a good sign. 

304
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,570
Mimi: How bad is it ? 

305
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,280
Well,you're sleep deprived 
like everyone else. 

306
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,020
Bring the bandages to 102. 

307
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,950
No,I mean the radiation. 

308
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,660
Am I dying ? 

309
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,020
Have you vomited ? 
No. 

310
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:56,860
Should I ? 

311
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,680
You just need some rest; go home. 

312
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,180
I'd like to. 

313
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,260
When's the next flight to D. C.  ? 

314
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,880
Dr. Green ? 

315
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,150
Oh,there are a lot of people waiting. 

316
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,670
If you could just...

317
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,460
I just want to know what happened to my friend. 

318
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,190
Scott rennie. 

319
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,470
It looks like he had a heart attack. 

320
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,150
I'm sorry. 

321
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,070
But...

322
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:35,830
so what if I have three queens,but I only have two jacks ? 

323
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,110
I'm out. 

324
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,980
I so bluffed you. 

325
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,420
Skylar,are you still alive in there ? 
Hey,what's up ? 

326
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,690
Sky,are you home ? 

327
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,970
Hello ?  ! 
dude,I'm starving. 

328
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,580
What's up ? Oh,my god. 

329
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,790
What's he doing here ? 

330
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,120
This is not how it looks. 

331
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,720
It sure looks how it looks. 

332
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,560
Lisa: Skylar,wait. 

333
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,920
That guy's a weirdo. 

334
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,120
I can't just sit around here all day. 

335
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,710
We've got to find the sheriff and 
his men,we've got to get the power back on. 

336
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,200
Okay,now you're going to stay 
here as long as it takes. 

337
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,730
Now,don't make me take your pants with me. 

338
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,250
I can run this town without my pants. 

339
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,750
It wouldn't be the first time. 

340
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,070
All right. 

341
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,630
That's a story I never want to hear. 

342
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,400
Sweetheart. 

343
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,770
How are you feeling,honey ? 

344
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,930
My leg's a little sore,but...

345
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,230
how's everything here ? 

346
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,430
Your father has the flu. 

347
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,700
It's nothing. 

348
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,840
Did you hear mr. Rennie died ? 

349
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,360
It's terrible. 

350
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,180
I've been thinking,more than anything,
this town needs information. 

351
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,680
We could organize a group of people. 

352
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,030
Send them out in every direction. 

353
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,290
I don't think anyone should be leaving jericho. 

354
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,840
We have to. 

355
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,810
We can't just sit here in the dark. 

356
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,310
He's right. 

357
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,630
Makes us too vulnerable. 

358
00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:00,150
Abrams,you and crossfield are taking the 
northern route up through nebraska to the 
state police barracks in broken bow. 

359
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,860
Well,I can go east to topeka and 
connect with the state government. 

360
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,550
Ridley can head west to denver. 

361
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,800
Well,what's left of it. 

362
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,760
You'll probably run into a ring of fema and ems 
people before you even get within sight of the city. 

363
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,810
See what they know. 

364
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,820
What about you ? 

365
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,930
He's going to wichita with me. 

366
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,220
That's right,emily and i are taking 
the southern route to wichita. 

367
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,780
Well,let's try to radio back as much 
information as possible along the way. 

368
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,750
Jake: That's the plan. 

369
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,890
Hitting the major cities in each 
direction,north,south,east and west. 

370
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,230
The four horsemen of the apocalypse. 

371
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,120
Let's hope not. 

372
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,240
Nope,we've still got static. 

373
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,970
Try pointing it east. 

374
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,330
We've got nothing,keep moving it. 

375
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,950
Nope,just static. 

376
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,600
Just keep trying. 

377
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,850
Mary. 

378
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,720
Excuse me. 

379
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,960
Mary. 

380
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,140
Man. 

381
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,500
Busy place. 

382
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,410
Yeah,although the service isn't 
what it used to be. 

383
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,850
what'll you have ? 

384
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:04,490
Oh,my god. 

385
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,790
We've got something ! 

386
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,220
where'd it go ? Come on,bring it back ! 

387
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,850
we're losing the feed ! Bring it back ! 

388
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,430
Go back. We had something. 

389
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,680
was that korean ? 

390
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,620
Does anybody know ? 

391
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,860
I think it was chinese. 

392
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,030
It was mandarin. 

393
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:55,800
The question is,were they just reporting 
it,or were they behind it ? 

394
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,040
Did stanley say if there were any markings 
on the side of the tank ? 

395
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,920
No. 

396
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,280
I mean,maybe we're being invaded. 

397
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,390
Abrams and crossfield are out. 

398
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,650
They won't drive into a war zone. 

399
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,010
Yeah,well,i don't blame them. 

400
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,940
Look,why don't we put this plan on hold right now ? 

401
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:09,100
We saw one image; we'll probably see another one. 

402
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,090
Going out is more important than ever,all right ? 

403
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,330
If this country is at war,we need to know it. 

404
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,650
Okay,we have los angeles,seattle and philadelphia. 

405
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,890
What else did you see on the tv ? 

406
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,340
I think seattle's wrong. 

407
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,040
Okay. 

408
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,940
Uh,could it have been portland ? 

409
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,390
I don't think so. 

410
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,830
I understand you lost some of your men ? 

411
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,600
Yeah. 

412
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,130
Need a volunteer,I'm available. 

413
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,800
Thanks,mister...

414
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,220
hawkins. 

415
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,850
Mr. Hawkins. 

416
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,050
Do you have a family ? 

417
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,040
Two kids. 

418
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,540
I think it's best if we stick to 
people who don't have families. 

419
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,240
Um,excuse me ? 

420
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,740
Mr. Cale ? 

421
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,850
Something's been bothering me. 

422
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:09,420
It's about mr. Rennie's death. 

423
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,730
The mine was full of people from the clinic. 

424
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,530
How come nobody called for a doctor ? 

425
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,070
I don't want to talk about it. 

426
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,020
I know you're upset. 

427
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,360
You guys were close. 

428
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,750
But he was my friend,too. 

429
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,210
I worked with him for three years. 

430
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,450
Gray: Hey,shep ? 

431
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,830
We're heading out for supplies. 

432
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,160
Why don't you give us a hand ? 

433
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,820
You know,this whole thing has 
been pretty hard on shep. 

434
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,670
He lost a good friend today. 

435
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,010
We all did. 

436
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,630
Emily ? 

437
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,390
Talk to me. 

438
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,520
Was it the broadcast ? 

439
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,420
Because we don't know what any of it means. 

440
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,610
They got wichita. 

441
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,050
Roger is deaD. 

442
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,170
We don't know that. 

443
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,890
I saw it on the map. 

444
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,420
Your fianc ? might have made it. 

445
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,580
How ? 

446
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:18,040
What if his flight got diverted to des moines ? 

447
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,970
Des moines' gone. 

448
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,450
Emily,what if it was omaha,huh ? 

449
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,700
Or tulsa. 

450
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,290
What if they set down in the middle 
of a cornfield in nebraska ? 

451
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,100
He could be anywhere. 

452
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,530
Plane went down trying to find a place to land. 

453
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,110
Emily ! 
What if it exploded ? 

454
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,060
What if he's dead ? 
Emily. 

455
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,780
He's gone,and I'm here with you. 

456
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:39,350
You were supposed to be the one that was dead...

457
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,070
not him. 

458
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,540
Just leave me alone,jake. 

459
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,400
Go without me. 

460
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,750
They took everything. 

461
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,930
Oh,dale. 

462
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,920
Thank god. 

463
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,230
I looked everywhere for you. 

464
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,580
Are you all right ? 

465
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,900
I was so worried. 

466
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,080
I was safe. 

467
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,440
Good. 

468
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,770
Gracie ? 

469
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,940
Oh,what now ? 

470
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,680
Gracie ? 

471
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,370
We're closed,gail. 

472
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,510
I'm out of everything. 

473
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,730
That's why I'm here. 

474
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:34,300
Some of the folks at the shelter brought 
some stuff back,and I thought you could use it. 

475
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,950
It's one box. 

476
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,720
I'm out of business. 

477
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,250
My train shipment was supposed 
to come through on tuesday. 

478
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:44,110
Without a delivery,these shelves are 
gonna stay as empty as they are right now. 

479
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,480
I don't have a freezer anymore. 

480
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,520
Most of this stuff is going 
to go bad any minute now. 

481
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,360
I know. 

482
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,130
Food's going bad all over town. 

483
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,860
I need my shipment. 

484
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:00,910
But we don't know if 
we'll ever get the power back on. 

485
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,950
Maybe we should cook it. 

486
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,050
What ? 

487
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,560
Everything,all of it. 

488
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,640
As long as it's still good enough to eat. 

489
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,700
are you okay ? 

490
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,200
If you call radiation poisoning okay. 

491
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,280
Were you out in the rain,too ? 

492
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,450
Oh,heavens,no. 

493
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,050
I touched a building when 
we came out of the shelter. 

494
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,780
Look,you can stop pretending. 

495
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,570
What do you mean ? 

496
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,970
I audited your farm. 

497
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,450
Why do you care ? 

498
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,190
Maybe I'm a nicer person than you. 

499
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,360
Right. 

500
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,350
Were you in the rain ? 

501
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:06,000
Yeah,for about 20 minutes. 

502
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,420
Well,you look pretty good. 

503
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,800
Thanks. 

504
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,670
Try to work out. 

505
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,400
look,um...

506
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,420
you know I think I got the worst of it. 

507
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,060
So as long as I'm okay,you should be fine. 

508
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,970
You're really sweet. 

509
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,740
and you still owe the irs $180,000. 

510
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,570
Yeah,I know. 

511
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,460
Every radio needs to be fully charged. 

512
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,750
We'll stay in contact as long as we can. 

513
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,600
Gray,the long-range ones are all charged. 

514
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,620
They're in the storage unit. 

515
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,070
All right,thanks. 

516
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,890
Ridley,why don't you go pack up 
the geiger counters and the flares ? 

517
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,760
I'll meet you out there. 

518
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:19,750
Gray,I just wanted to tell you 
how much I appreciate what you're doing. 

519
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,900
It's a gutsy move,and,uh,
the whole town thanks you. 

520
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:23,880
Yeah,thanks. 

521
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,230
What the hell happened out there ? 

522
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,130
I've known scott rennie his whole life. 

523
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,710
He's strong as an ox. I just...

524
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,020
I can't believe he's dead. 

525
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,530
He was a good man. 

526
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,440
Heart attack at his age. 

527
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,870
Yeah,well,it wasn't a heart 
attack that killed him. 

528
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,100
What do you mean ? 

529
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,420
It was poor planning. 

530
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:43,270
What are you talking about ? 

531
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:47,880
What I'm saying is that none of this would have 
happened if that clinic shelter had been maintained. 

532
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,950
You have a lot of people to answer to. 
All right,that's enough. 

533
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,260
No,that's not nearly enough. 

534
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,560
I get back here,there's gonna be an investigation. 

535
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,490
Hundreds of people could have died 
'cause you dropped the ball. 

536
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,620
Why don't we talk about this in my office ? 

537
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,250
You dropped the ball,and it killed scott rennie. 

538
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,650
In my office. Now. 

539
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,850
right now these people need our leadership. 

540
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,670
I will not have you tearing this town apart. 

541
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:20,830
And when all this is over,if you and I are 
still alive,you investigate your ass off. 

542
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:25,680
In the meantime,if I hear any more talk like 
that out of you,you and i are gonna have a problem. 

543
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,490
Do we understand each other ? 

544
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,970
Where's emily ? 

545
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,490
She's not going. 

546
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,660
Good. 

547
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,110
You're not going alone,are you ? 

548
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,250
Yeah. 

549
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,300
Don't give me that look. 

550
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,110
What look ? 

551
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,830
You know what look. 

552
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,770
That look. 

553
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:26,030
Hey,I told you 7,500 times,I have watched you 
drive away,not knowing if you were coming home. 

554
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,230
I've earned a look. 

555
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,680
I'm coming back. 

556
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,110
Take care. 

557
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,460
Let's go ! 

558
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,820
Ridley ? 

559
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,560
Come on. 

560
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,470
Shep ? 

561
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,960
Taking ridley's place. 

562
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,490
Going to denver. 

563
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,830
You don't have to do this. 

564
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,770
What about your family ? 

565
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,130
I got to get out of here. 

566
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,450
Shep,you'll get past this. 

567
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,910
Yeah ? 

568
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,420
Hey,heather. 

569
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,960
Shep left this for you. 

570
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,640
Thanks. 

571
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:44,190
"Dear heather,"I want you to know 
the truth about scott rennie. 

572
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,880
"It was my fault. 

573
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,000
"Gray wanted me to keep him quiet,
"and his heart went out. 

574
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,890
"I should have called for a doctor,
but I was scared. 

575
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,580
"I let him die. 

576
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,460
"I'll never forgive myself. 

577
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,880
"You were a good friend to scott. 

578
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,520
"A better friend than I ever was. 

579
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,430
Shep. 

580
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,860
Well,they should be about 50 miles out by now. 

581
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,520
Jake,are you still reading me ? 

582
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,740
Jake ? 

583
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,610
I lost him. 

584
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,200
Shep,are you there ? 

585
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,460
Shep ? 

586
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:34,410
Eric,do me a favor. 

587
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,740
I missed that last one,shep. 

588
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,530
Can you say it again ? 

589
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,820
Tell him I'm sorry. 

590
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,260
Tell the family I'm sorry. 

591
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,370
You're breaking up,shep. 

592
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,540
Hey,gray,did you catch that ? 

593
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,000
No. 

594
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,530
No,I didn'T. 

595
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,710
I don't know,that would make about 45 miles. 

596
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,600
Right,so,in about an hour...

597
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,940
Jake,what are you doing back ? 

598
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,140
You should be in wichita by now. 

599
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,050
Smoky hill bridge is blocked. 

600
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,460
What is that ? 

601
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,640
It's a flight data recorder. 

602
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:15,970
I thought they were supposed to be black. 

603
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:16,990
Well,where'd you get it ? 

604
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:20,500
A couple of pilots used the highway as 
a landing strip with mixed results. 

605
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,860
This is the only one I could get. 

606
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,030
Were there any survivors ? 

607
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:31,260
it was a commuter plane that didn't 
make it,a 757 that was empty. 

608
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,620
Well,where are they ? 

609
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,530
Where'd they go ? 

610
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,000
How do we listen to this ? 

611
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,290
Do you have that old reel-to-reel laying around ? 

612
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,050
Your father needs to hear this. 
I'm going to go get him. 

613
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,260
You okay ? 

614
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:43,800
Yeah. 

615
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,410
I'm a little freaked. 

616
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,250
Dad's here. 

617
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,280
I've gone through most of this 
recording from the plane that crashed. 

618
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,570
This is the last 30 seconds or so. 

619
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,720
A lot of background noise. You can hear...

620
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,150
pilots from planes in the 
area talking to each other. 

621
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,640
Wait. 

622
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,120
The kids. 

623
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,500
Oh,yeah. Come on,girls. Let's go. 

624
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,550
Is anyone on this frequency ? 
There's no reply from atcc ! 

625
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,090
please advise

626
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:36,380
Ray-27 in emergency descend,
need coordinates for approach. 

627
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,570
Give me full flaps; it's about to get bumpy. 

628
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,270
This is chinook 116 heavy. 

629
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,120
Missed our handoff to kansas city atcc. 

630
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,420
Does anyone read us ? Over. 

631
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,480
Chinook 116,this is glen 5-6,reading you. 

632
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,530
We're bingo fuel,lost all vfr heading out of chicago. 

633
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,660
Tried all frequencies; there's no one out there. 

634
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,860
What does that mean ? 
They're out of gas and blind. 

635
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,070
Guys,this is primary 221. 

636
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,780
I've got a mushroom cloud 16 kilometers 
in height somewhere northwest over denver. 

637
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:07,230
I've got a visual on two separate plumes...one over 
in kansas city and one south somewhere in texas. 

638
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,620
Does anyone read atc ? 

639
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,210
Negative. There is no atcc anymore,chinook. 

640
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,340
He's saying there's no traffic control. 

641
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,110
There's 10,000 planes with no place to land. 

642
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,840
That's about a million people in the air. 

643
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,800
Are those f-16s ? 

644
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,370
Right. Do you have a visual ? 

645
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,710
Affirm. Prime missouri guard. 

646
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,280
131st out of landburg. 

647
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,120
These guys are hauling ass somewhere. 

648
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,420
Chinook 116,this is glen 5-6. 

649
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,050
We found a stretch of highway long enough. 

650
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:31,840
Follow us in. 

651
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:34,030
Setting down on final approach,stand by. 

652
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,220
Here we go. 

653
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,580
Flaps,I need more flaps. 

654
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,970
Losing it. 

655
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,300
I can't hold it. 

656
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:40,850
we're sliding here. 

657
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:41,940
pull up ! 

658
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,670
Pull up ! 

659
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,980
I can'T...

660
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,900
chinook 116,this is glen 5-6. 

661
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,580
We found a stretch of highway long enough. 

662
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,570
Chinook 116,this is glen 5-6. 

663
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,740
We found A...

664
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,130
chinook 116,this is glen 5-6. 

665
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:09,580
Trans shore...
we found a stretch of highway long...

666
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,100
emily,come here. 

667
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:15,460
Roger was on trans shore 724,right ? 

668
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:16,320
Yes. 

669
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,830
Listen. 

670
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,150
This is primary...
jake,what is this ? 

671
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,700
Just listen. Background chatter. 
My co-pilot's blind. 

672
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:29,420
Still up and going,going to burn off some 
fuel and then we're going to F...

673
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,590
chinook 116,this is glen 5-6. 

674
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,350
This is trans shore 724. 

675
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,970
We've set down in a field,gps malfunctioned. 

676
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,290
I think we're north of kansas. 

677
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,890
Minor injuries. 

678
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,650
He's alive. 

679
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,530
He's alive. 

680
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,750
robert ? 

681
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,900
There's,uh,music outside. 

682
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,350
Yeah. 

683
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:22,240
Yeah,the party. 

684
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:28,250
Sounded like sam cooke from here,but,uh,there's a chance it could be kenny rogers. 

685
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,450
oh,lord. 

686
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,680
Robert,the kids would like to go. 

687
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,100
To the party ? 

688
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,530
Yes. 

689
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,410
We're not ready. 

690
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,230
Robert. 

691
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,370
No. 

692
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,750
No. 

693
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,570
well,I'm glad there was enough food for everyone. 

694
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,870
I just wish someone would've said thank you. 

695
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:09,150
oh,it looks delicious. 

696
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,410
thanks. 

697
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,110
She looks so much better. 

698
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:42,080
you really made her happy. 

699
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,570
I owed her.

00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,010
Well,I'd say this makes you even. 

701
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,000
Not even close. 

702
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:02,500
you haven't said two words all night. 

703
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,410
just taking it all in. 

704
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:12,900
It might be a long time before 
we see jericho like this again. 

705
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,270
I got to go. 

706
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,230
What time is it ? 

707
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,600
It's a little past midnight. 

708
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,830
Do you really have to go ? 

709
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,700
Yeah,I should probably go.
