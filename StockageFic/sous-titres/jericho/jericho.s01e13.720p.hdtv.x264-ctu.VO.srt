1
00:00:00,222 --> 00:00:01,628
Previously on Jericho.

2
00:00:01,765 --> 00:00:03,775
<i>So I hear you and I
are going to be partners now.</i>

3
00:00:03,776 --> 00:00:04,818
<i>Where'd you get that?</i>

4
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:07,190
<i>You're running the store,
you're going to need protection.</i>

5
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,560
<i>Don't make the same mistake
that Gracie made.</i>

6
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:12,561
<i>Or those people out there
are going to be putting</i>

7
00:00:12,562 --> 00:00:14,364
<i>flowers and candles
on the sidewalk for you.</i>

8
00:00:16,144 --> 00:00:17,166
<i>Who the hell is that?</i>

9
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:25,834
<i>Remember,
the gas tank on this thing</i>

10
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:27,075
<i>is on the left-hand side,</i>

11
00:00:27,076 --> 00:00:29,047
<i>so if somebody decides
to start shooting at you,</i>

12
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:30,405
<i>make sure it's not on that side.</i>

13
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:31,590
<i>Okay. Anything else?</i>

14
00:00:37,283 --> 00:00:39,853
<i>So, are we going to see you
for Thanksgiving?</i>

15
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:42,657
<i>Well, I think Mary and I
are going to spend it together.</i>

16
00:00:42,658 --> 00:00:43,885
<i>Well, you're always welcome.</i>

17
00:00:43,886 --> 00:00:46,501
<i>Thanks, but I don't want to put
you guys in an awkward position.</i>

18
00:00:46,502 --> 00:00:49,311
<i>You could have thought of that before
you moved in with your mistress</i>

19
00:00:49,312 --> 00:00:50,642
<i>and left your wife with us.</i>

20
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,339
<i>Some of them were on planes</i>

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,842
<i>that landed in the middle of nowhere.</i>

22
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:56,796
<i>They've been walking for weeks.</i>

23
00:00:57,326 --> 00:00:58,868
<i>They must have gone through hell.</i>

24
00:00:59,113 --> 00:01:00,149
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

25
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:06,243
<i>Is it really you?</i>

26
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,105
<i>I need you to keep the kids
in the house for a while</i>

27
00:01:09,106 --> 00:01:10,399
<i>until I can sort something out.</i>

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,697
<i>Are we in danger, Robert?</i>

29
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,534
<i>You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.</i>

30
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:17,284
<i>You need to keep them
clean and warm.</i>

31
00:01:18,213 --> 00:01:19,459
<i>Do you have a place to stay?</i>

32
00:01:20,774 --> 00:01:22,306
<i>Do you know anyone in Jericho?</i>

33
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:26,161
<i>Actually,</i>

34
00:01:26,893 --> 00:01:27,897
<i>I do.</i>

35
00:01:38,103 --> 00:01:39,531
It's freezing in here, too.

36
00:01:40,187 --> 00:01:41,190
Mr. Bintner?

37
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:46,804
Mr. Bintner?

38
00:01:52,089 --> 00:01:53,189
Joe?

39
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:20,391
The temperature dropped so fast.

40
00:02:24,326 --> 00:02:26,274
It's going to be a long winter.

41
00:02:26,303 --> 00:02:28,329
All right, everyone!
Everyone, please!

42
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:29,718
Please!

43
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,933
Right now,

44
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:33,267
we're using the generator
to power the town hall

45
00:02:33,268 --> 00:02:35,544
for three hours a day,
and the Med Center for six.

46
00:02:36,084 --> 00:02:38,727
And this is how much fuel we have,

47
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:41,081
and this is how much we need

48
00:02:41,082 --> 00:02:42,470
to get us through the winter.

49
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,978
At current levels of consumption,

50
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:47,833
we will be completely
out of gas and diesel

51
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,933
in two weeks.

52
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:51,354
I wonder when the dancing girls show up.

53
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:52,357
Stop.

54
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:55,782
There's a way of doing this without
scaring the crap out of everybody.

55
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:57,016
He was elected.

56
00:02:57,486 --> 00:02:58,895
Guess he's going to do it his way.

57
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:01,075
I'm going to need a hobby.

58
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:02,416
So here's what we're working on.

59
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:04,721
All right, we got
organized firewood crews...

60
00:03:04,846 --> 00:03:06,428
- Mr. Hawkins?
- Yeah.

61
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,454
There's a woman
in that group of refugees

62
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,750
that Bill is processing,
I think you should talk to her.

63
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:11,966
Why?

64
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:14,146
She said she used to be
a cop in Saint Louis.

65
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:18,371
Especially with 53
new people among us,

66
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,763
we have got to start rethinking things,

67
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,442
fast,

68
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:24,198
or the people we lost last night

69
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,455
won't be the only casualties
of this coming winter.

70
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,970
What about the windmills?

71
00:03:28,086 --> 00:03:29,089
She's right.

72
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:31,095
Wind power.

73
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:33,372
We should be building windmills.

74
00:03:33,373 --> 00:03:34,385
Harry?

75
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:36,581
I think you all know Harry Carmichael,

76
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:38,317
our chief engineer
down at the mine.

77
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,175
We've been looking into wind turbines
for weeks now with Mayor Green.

78
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:43,818
But in order to build anything
that can be connected to the grid,

79
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:45,284
it's going to take time.

80
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:47,590
Time I'm not sure we can afford.

81
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,895
- She's in here.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

82
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:03,351
Hello, Rob.

83
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:07,461
Any parts we don't have...

84
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:09,815
we simply don't have
the maching capabilities.

85
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,397
What kind of parts?

86
00:04:11,764 --> 00:04:14,041
Mechanical governors to regulate output.

87
00:04:14,427 --> 00:04:17,166
With the EMP damage, we're figuring
out a lot of this from scratch.

88
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:20,041
- It's still a long way off.
- Black Jack Fairgrounds.

89
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:23,296
We walked through it
on our way back here.

90
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:24,865
It's become a trading post.

91
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:27,383
People from all over
the region are trading...

92
00:04:27,776 --> 00:04:29,443
food, information,

93
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:31,012
machine parts.

94
00:04:31,623 --> 00:04:32,800
They may have what we need.

95
00:04:32,803 --> 00:04:34,519
That's got to be a 200-mile drive.

96
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,246
That's a lot of gas for a "maybe."

97
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,234
If we can get one windmill working,

98
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:39,989
we'd save that much gas in a month.

99
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,346
If we get enough of them,
we could be off gas for good.

100
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:45,622
It might not be a bad idea

101
00:04:45,623 --> 00:04:47,677
to put a small party together
and go check it out.

102
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:50,407
Is anyone interested
in volunteering?

103
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,125
Season 1 - Episode 13

[ www. seriessub.com ]

106
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,546
I know it was you.

107
00:05:23,048 --> 00:05:24,630
- What?
- Those men that grabbed me.

108
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:27,427
They said that someone
on my team sold us all out.

109
00:05:28,547 --> 00:05:29,956
They said it was you.

110
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:31,886
And you believe them?

111
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:32,928
Tell me why I shouldn't.

112
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:34,471
Come on!
You're smart enough to know

113
00:05:34,472 --> 00:05:36,419
that they will say anything
to get you to talk.

114
00:05:36,988 --> 00:05:39,072
Because you know
I owe you my life

115
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:41,576
as much as you owe me yours
and because you just...

116
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:45,472
You just punched me in the face,
and I didn't hit you back.

117
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:49,514
- Who else is here?
- No one.

118
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,337
Victor showed up
just after D-day.

119
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,786
But he only made it
for a couple of hours.

120
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:57,983
Did you kill him?

121
00:05:59,314 --> 00:06:00,761
It was the radiation...

122
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:02,285
from Denver.

123
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,610
No one else made it back here
to the rally point?

124
00:06:13,263 --> 00:06:15,752
You going to tell me
how you got out of that room?

125
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,361
Three armed guys, cuffs.

126
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:20,560
Three guys and cuffs
keep you in that room?

127
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,280
One of them got too close.

128
00:06:23,956 --> 00:06:25,480
Then there was only two.

129
00:06:25,962 --> 00:06:27,100
Two was easy.

130
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:29,450
From there,
I drove as fast as I could.

131
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:31,871
Saw the clouds
from D. C. and Baltimore.

132
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:34,476
Ran out of gas in West Virginia.

133
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:37,427
Went from refugee camp
to refugee camp

134
00:06:37,428 --> 00:06:38,890
however I could.

135
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,963
I'm glad you made it.

136
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,320
You left me.

137
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,311
I know.

138
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:52,838
So what now?

139
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:58,584
We caught wind of some raiding parties
at interchanges here and here.

140
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,780
But if you're careful,

141
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:01,497
you should be safe
the rest of the way.

142
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:04,266
Once you're at Black Jack,
watch your back.

143
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,983
Thieves?

144
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:08,472
It's not the thieves you got
to worry about, it's the guards.

145
00:07:08,473 --> 00:07:10,864
They've got a reputation
of being really ruthless.

146
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:12,996
Without the cops
or the National Guard,

147
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:15,098
it's the only way they
guaranteed it's safe enough

148
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:16,266
to keep commerce going there.

149
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:18,985
You'd better take two or three
of the border patrol guys with you.

150
00:07:18,986 --> 00:07:21,028
Just in case you run
into any surprises.

151
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:22,089
I'm coming, too.

152
00:07:22,648 --> 00:07:23,758
Not a chance in hell.

153
00:07:23,835 --> 00:07:25,648
Would you know
a working mechanical governor

154
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:27,539
for a wind turbine
if you saw one?

155
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:33,617
I'm not taking
passengers out there.

156
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,652
Jake, Mr. Carmichael has a family.

157
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:40,215
I can help.

158
00:07:40,562 --> 00:07:41,990
You need me.

159
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:49,668
Mrs. Green?

160
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:51,848
What?

161
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:56,151
Eric told me that
April's pregnant.

162
00:07:57,096 --> 00:07:58,234
I just...

163
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:01,349
- If there's anything that I can do...
- Mary...

164
00:08:01,754 --> 00:08:03,741
I think you've done quite enough.

165
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:11,285
Always got to be the first one
to jump in the fire, don't you?

166
00:08:11,286 --> 00:08:12,462
Somebody's got to go.

167
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:15,453
Yeah, well, just seems
that someone is always you.

168
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:19,427
Gray's having a few bags of salt
packed up for us to trade.

169
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,106
Smart.

170
00:08:21,107 --> 00:08:22,244
Who else is going?

171
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:23,671
Apparently Heather.

172
00:08:24,115 --> 00:08:26,970
Gray thinks I should take
a couple of guys from border patrol.

173
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:27,992
That's it?

174
00:08:27,993 --> 00:08:29,883
I'm not so sure
pulling them off patrol

175
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,889
just to watch my back
is such a good idea.

176
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:35,265
Besides, only a handful of them
even know what they're doing.

177
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:37,349
You don't think
I can watch your back?

178
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:39,143
Why? You want to go?

179
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:42,790
Look, you've already seen
what it's like out there. I just...

180
00:08:43,465 --> 00:08:45,221
need to see it for myself.

181
00:08:45,587 --> 00:08:48,076
Besides, I'm unemployed.
I'm not obsolete.

182
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:50,642
Did you ask Mom?

183
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,999
Son, I am 59 years old.

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,989
I was mayor of this town
since the Carter administration.

185
00:08:57,213 --> 00:09:00,724
I'm a retired U. S. Army Ranger
and a combat veteran.

186
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:03,011
Of course I asked your mother.

187
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:09,397
I could go downstairs and...

188
00:09:09,398 --> 00:09:11,712
warm some water
for a bath for you.

189
00:09:30,097 --> 00:09:32,374
I didn't think I was ever
going to finish this.

190
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:48,869
Hey, uh...
we have a guest.

191
00:09:50,528 --> 00:09:51,897
This is Sarah.

192
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:11,094
Hey, Dale?

193
00:10:14,817 --> 00:10:16,515
Hey. What are you
doing back there?

194
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:17,807
Uh, inventory.

195
00:10:17,865 --> 00:10:19,003
Is it that bad?

196
00:10:19,755 --> 00:10:22,939
Well, Mr. Houghton just showed up
with Mrs. Leigh's cut of the produce.

197
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:25,524
- What the hell is that?
- Yeah, exactly.

198
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,569
Well, did you point out
that it's rotten?

199
00:10:28,147 --> 00:10:30,829
They're all screwing me.
Hardly anyone's honoring their deals.

200
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,240
My dad used to have to deal with stuff

201
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:35,150
like this all the time
down at the salt mine.

202
00:10:35,517 --> 00:10:37,234
- Well, how did he do it?
- He just...

203
00:10:37,696 --> 00:10:39,896
did whatever it took
to keep things running.

204
00:10:40,185 --> 00:10:41,979
I'm not shutting this place down.

205
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,095
Actually,

206
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,111
I may have
good news about that.

207
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,523
But you might have
to take a little trip.

208
00:10:56,662 --> 00:10:58,032
I need to talk to you.

209
00:10:59,132 --> 00:11:00,154
All right.

210
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:02,466
I shouldn't have sprung this on you.

211
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:03,817
This is too weird...

212
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:05,707
What? What's weird?

213
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,424
I kissed you.

214
00:11:13,003 --> 00:11:14,026
A month ago.

215
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:15,531
And we haven't spoken since.

216
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,884
Generally, people speak
after something like that.

217
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,196
I'm just going to...

218
00:11:20,103 --> 00:11:21,261
You know...

219
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:27,183
I know, I'm, uh...

220
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,077
- I'm sorry, really...
- You don't have to apologize.

221
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:31,158
I'm not upset.

222
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:33,855
I understand
why it happened.

223
00:11:34,434 --> 00:11:35,495
Look, I want to go

224
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:38,081
because I think I can help get
this place back up on its feet.

225
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,222
That's it.
It's not a date.

226
00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:42,498
Mr. Mayor?

227
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:44,370
I'm not the mayor anymore, Dale.
What is it?

228
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:45,995
I need to come with you.

229
00:11:47,384 --> 00:11:48,452
I want to take it all.

230
00:11:48,478 --> 00:11:49,479
Trade it for something

231
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,783
I can actually use
to build this store up again.

232
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:53,028
Whatever I don't use,

233
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:54,925
I'll put towards
supplies the town needs.

234
00:11:55,646 --> 00:11:58,029
You're just going to give it
away to the town for nothing?

235
00:11:58,338 --> 00:12:01,174
It's the right thing to do, isn't it?
I just want to help.

236
00:12:04,164 --> 00:12:05,186
Well,

237
00:12:05,187 --> 00:12:07,694
this is one hell of a crew
we're putting together here.

238
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,068
All right.

239
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:16,955
Yeah, we'll leave
first thing in the morning.

240
00:12:18,141 --> 00:12:20,534
You just happen to know
someone who just...

241
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,022
happened to wander into town?

242
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,154
Look at me.

243
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:30,739
I'm not going to lie to you.

244
00:12:31,395 --> 00:12:32,630
But I can't...

245
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:37,317
I can't tell you any more
than I already have.

246
00:12:38,452 --> 00:12:39,494
So she's a friend, okay?

247
00:12:39,495 --> 00:12:41,817
The last time you let someone
from that part of your life

248
00:12:41,818 --> 00:12:44,259
- into our home, it was 4 years ago.
- This is different.

249
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,839
Well, you couldn't tell me
who he was.

250
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:48,363
But you told me not to worry.

251
00:12:49,713 --> 00:12:50,755
Two weeks later, you left.

252
00:12:50,756 --> 00:12:52,564
I didn't see you again
until two months ago.

253
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:54,679
This is different.

254
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,232
Sam cried for weeks.

255
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:57,897
I mean, he was four-years-old.

256
00:12:57,898 --> 00:12:59,924
He didn't understand why
you'd want to leave him.

257
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:02,586
I just...

258
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,001
I don't know if I can watch him
go through that again.

259
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:49,305
What is going on here?

260
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,495
Come here.

261
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,489
What is this?

262
00:14:00,937 --> 00:14:02,775
So I'm being watched.

263
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:04,613
By who?

264
00:14:04,614 --> 00:14:05,880
My guess...

265
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:07,564
The Old Man.

266
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:09,479
Why...?

267
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:15,704
You still have the package, don't you?

268
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,087
He's been coordinating
this thing from the beginning,

269
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:24,624
feeding us information.

270
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:27,498
Why would he turn on us now?

271
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:28,579
I don't know.

272
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,360
You still have
a way to reach him?

273
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:33,213
And have you...

274
00:14:33,214 --> 00:14:35,477
told him that you
made contact with me yet?

275
00:14:35,554 --> 00:14:37,439
- Not yet.
- Then do it.

276
00:14:40,343 --> 00:14:41,377
You do it...

277
00:14:42,026 --> 00:14:43,695
and you see what he says.

278
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,147
"Thieves will be strung up."

279
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:18,990
We need your guns.

280
00:15:29,587 --> 00:15:31,224
Pick them up on the way out.

281
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,577
Go ahead.

282
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,744
They're kidding about
the "strung up" thing, right?

283
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:02,196
They don't mean that literally.

284
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:34,324
Looks like everyone
checks in here at the main tent.

285
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:36,271
They try and match
buyers and sellers.

286
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:38,108
They gave me three
possibilities of sellers

287
00:16:38,109 --> 00:16:39,852
that might have the part
for the windmill.

288
00:16:39,853 --> 00:16:40,856
It's like eBay.

289
00:16:45,976 --> 00:16:46,987
Not like eBay.

290
00:16:46,988 --> 00:16:48,222
All right, look, um...

291
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:51,513
see if you can find the governor,
I'm going to stick with Dale.

292
00:16:52,254 --> 00:16:53,412
See what he can trade for.

293
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,467
Let's do this thing quick
then we're out of here.

294
00:16:58,943 --> 00:17:00,086
Morning.

295
00:17:01,165 --> 00:17:02,292
Good morning.

296
00:17:08,008 --> 00:17:10,464
Last night,
you fell asleep mid-sentence.

297
00:17:11,082 --> 00:17:12,951
- I did?
- Yes, you did.

298
00:17:13,026 --> 00:17:15,837
Standing up right there
at the sink, shaving.

299
00:17:16,254 --> 00:17:19,004
You were going to tell me
what you've seen out there and...

300
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,491
Roger, I...

301
00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:25,230
I don't want to push.

302
00:17:25,616 --> 00:17:28,838
I can't even imagine how awful
it was for you out there. I just...

303
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,938
A lot of it was.

304
00:17:31,693 --> 00:17:32,697
Listen.

305
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:35,128
If I tell you something,

306
00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:38,118
will you promise not to think...

307
00:17:38,717 --> 00:17:40,279
I've lost it?

308
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,414
Of course.

309
00:17:43,304 --> 00:17:44,520
Out there...

310
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:47,742
I saw... something.

311
00:17:49,131 --> 00:17:51,292
I haven't told
anybody about it. I...

312
00:17:52,815 --> 00:17:54,127
can't explain it.

313
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,446
The thing is...

314
00:17:58,758 --> 00:18:00,996
it was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

315
00:18:03,312 --> 00:18:05,994
From there I ended up
in a tent city outside of Lexington.

316
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:08,174
So, what are they like?

317
00:18:08,617 --> 00:18:10,122
The camps?

318
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,401
Each is, uh... different.

319
00:18:13,575 --> 00:18:15,794
Some are overcrowded, dangerous.

320
00:18:16,508 --> 00:18:17,588
Some are better run.

321
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:19,652
Did you see people
with radiation poisoning?

322
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:20,849
Some, yes.

323
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:22,160
What do they look like?

324
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:23,684
Lots of burns,

325
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,729
tissue loss, some vomiting.

326
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:26,963
Allie, Sam.

327
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:28,680
Upstairs.

328
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:37,632
How do you know my dad?

329
00:18:38,231 --> 00:18:39,735
We worked together.

330
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:41,935
Do you know how
to play football?

331
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,311
Of course, I do.
Doesn't everybody?

332
00:18:46,218 --> 00:18:47,414
Not everybody.

333
00:18:47,415 --> 00:18:49,478
Hey, Samuel, now.

334
00:18:50,983 --> 00:18:52,121
Come on.

335
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:59,548
You know, these kids
have been through enough.

336
00:19:00,204 --> 00:19:01,690
I... I'm sorry.

337
00:19:02,018 --> 00:19:04,507
Look, I don't know you.
I really don't want to.

338
00:19:04,874 --> 00:19:07,440
I know the kind of people
my husband works with.

339
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,122
No matter how close
the two of you are,

340
00:19:10,123 --> 00:19:12,398
I don't need my kids
exposed to that world.

341
00:19:14,424 --> 00:19:17,511
I've been married to
this man a long time.

342
00:19:17,993 --> 00:19:20,405
I got pretty good at reading
between the lines.

343
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,034
Thanks, Mary.

344
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:40,931
Why don't you and I sit down
together and have a drink?

345
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,256
Hey, how much?

346
00:19:53,028 --> 00:19:54,918
- Beg pardon?
- How much?

347
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,751
How much for what?

348
00:19:57,774 --> 00:19:58,950
I don't know.

349
00:19:59,352 --> 00:20:00,375
An hour?

350
00:20:02,246 --> 00:20:03,442
An hour of what?

351
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,568
Wait, what?! No!

352
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:08,767
- How about a half hour?
- Is everything all right?

353
00:20:08,768 --> 00:20:11,179
- I'm not a hooker, pal!
- Then what are you doing here?

354
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,372
All right, that's enough.

355
00:20:12,835 --> 00:20:14,513
That's enough, man.

356
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:18,102
- Is there a problem here?
- Hey, no. No.

357
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,664
No problem. Everything's fine.

358
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,730
No kidding, buddy.

359
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:26,342
You don't want to mess with
the guards here, it gets ugly, fast.

360
00:20:26,343 --> 00:20:27,361
Thanks for the help.

361
00:20:29,488 --> 00:20:30,503
Heather.

362
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:32,979
Oh, my God, Ted.

363
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,535
I can't believe you're here.

364
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,872
Jake, this is Ted Lewis.

365
00:20:41,318 --> 00:20:43,112
We grew up together
over in New Bern.

366
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:45,235
This is Russell and Mike.

367
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:46,295
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.

368
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:47,570
I was so worried about you.

369
00:20:47,994 --> 00:20:50,443
We were going to send a party
to make contact with you guys,

370
00:20:50,444 --> 00:20:52,219
but the roads were
just so dangerous.

371
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:53,961
What are you guys doing here?

372
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,065
We're looking for parts
for a windmill generator.

373
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:57,075
Unsuccessfully.

374
00:20:57,843 --> 00:21:00,162
Hey, there's a guy
we deal with here...

375
00:21:00,163 --> 00:21:01,931
who doesn't always
report to the main tent,

376
00:21:01,932 --> 00:21:04,044
but sometimes he's got
those specialty items

377
00:21:04,045 --> 00:21:05,696
nobody else has.
You want to see him?

378
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,355
- Yeah, let's check it out.
- All right.

379
00:21:11,927 --> 00:21:14,160
Get this stuff out of here
before somebody sees it.

380
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:15,552
Why, what's wrong with it?

381
00:21:15,553 --> 00:21:16,573
Nickel...

382
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:18,334
the silver stuff
is all alloyed with it.

383
00:21:18,338 --> 00:21:19,345
So?

384
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:21,037
So nickel absorbs radioactivity.

385
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:22,711
Stuff that's been looted
from hot zones

386
00:21:22,712 --> 00:21:24,866
is making a lot of people sick.
No one wants it.

387
00:21:25,043 --> 00:21:26,742
This stuff was nowhere
near the fallout.

388
00:21:26,938 --> 00:21:28,866
Look, kid,
if I can't sell it, I can't sell it.

389
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:30,163
What do you want me to tell you?

390
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:31,818
What else do you got?

391
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:33,883
So what does have value here?

392
00:21:34,134 --> 00:21:35,234
Not much of what you got.

393
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,278
Check the board over there.

394
00:21:39,005 --> 00:21:40,085
Why salt?

395
00:21:40,471 --> 00:21:41,648
It's a preservative.

396
00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:43,230
An antibiotic.

397
00:21:43,597 --> 00:21:46,876
You need 1,500 milligrams
of it a day to survive.

398
00:21:47,418 --> 00:21:50,100
The Romans actually
used it as currency.

399
00:21:50,525 --> 00:21:52,126
Whole African empires

400
00:21:52,127 --> 00:21:54,566
were based on the control
and supply of it.

401
00:21:54,778 --> 00:21:56,495
Wars have been fought over salt.

402
00:21:57,064 --> 00:21:58,626
Food, medical supplies,

403
00:21:58,627 --> 00:22:01,192
a generator, all air-dropped,
all from China.

404
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,463
What?

405
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:05,026
Yeah, we got an airdrop, too.

406
00:22:05,643 --> 00:22:07,824
The thing is...
it was from Germany.

407
00:22:08,634 --> 00:22:10,930
It's aid. It must be coming
from all over the world.

408
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,500
Well, if aid's coming
from all over the world then...

409
00:22:14,654 --> 00:22:15,927
who did this to us?

410
00:22:15,928 --> 00:22:17,413
A group of thugs a few weeks back,

411
00:22:17,414 --> 00:22:19,659
guys claiming to be
government contractors.

412
00:22:20,332 --> 00:22:22,883
So the mayor thought
we should make security a priority.

413
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:24,434
He resigned his office and...

414
00:22:24,956 --> 00:22:28,021
appointed Sheriff Constantino
acting city manager.

415
00:22:28,672 --> 00:22:30,066
The contractors,
who were they?

416
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,629
A security detail from a...

417
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:34,404
company called Ravenwood.

418
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:36,273
They came in looking for supplies.

419
00:22:36,274 --> 00:22:38,598
A few of the shop owners resisted
and they got violent.

420
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,668
They killed three,
they injured eight.

421
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:42,848
They drove off with
a truckload of our diesel.

422
00:22:43,407 --> 00:22:44,661
But since then,

423
00:22:44,873 --> 00:22:46,861
the sheriff's managed to
keep control of things.

424
00:22:47,864 --> 00:22:49,909
Crime really isn't a
problem for us anymore.

425
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,240
How'd he manage that?

426
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,008
- What is this?
- The news.

427
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:04,571
Where does all this come from?

428
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,906
People pass through here
from all over.

429
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,356
Everyone brings
a little piece of the puzzle.

430
00:23:14,336 --> 00:23:16,169
Do you have
something to write on?

431
00:23:18,176 --> 00:23:20,163
You guys don't
get out much, do you?

432
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,902
It gets better.

433
00:23:38,275 --> 00:23:39,722
What are the stars for?

434
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:41,149
Capitals.

435
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,326
Of what?

436
00:23:43,985 --> 00:23:45,258
The federal government.

437
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:47,766
Federal government? But...

438
00:23:49,156 --> 00:23:52,011
There are six stars up there.
Where's the president?

439
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:55,253
Which one?

440
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,525
Six presidents, I...

441
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:08,497
I don't understand.
Who's in charge of the military?

442
00:24:08,545 --> 00:24:10,523
You're assuming
there's only one of those, too.

443
00:24:10,524 --> 00:24:11,700
All right, come on, let's go.

444
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:14,842
Isn't there a line of succession,
so there's only one successor?

445
00:24:14,843 --> 00:24:15,944
The word is HHS.

446
00:24:15,945 --> 00:24:18,027
Secretary Charles is supposed
to be next in line,

447
00:24:18,028 --> 00:24:20,111
but there are five other guys
who seem to think

448
00:24:20,112 --> 00:24:21,423
the attacks changed the rules.

449
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:24,433
Senator Morrisette in Oregon,
Senator Tomarchio in Wyoming...

450
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:27,226
They're all staking a claim,
gathering support.

451
00:24:27,477 --> 00:24:29,889
Then what happens?
How do they figure out who's in charge?

452
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:31,586
Either they start making deals,

453
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:33,188
- compromise...
- Or?

454
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:35,344
Or they fight.

455
00:24:36,483 --> 00:24:39,087
Six bags of soybean seed,
and still it's...

456
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:40,525
It's not enough.

457
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:43,129
Maybe this whole thing
was a bad idea.

458
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,190
It's a start.

459
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,566
Dale, wait up.

460
00:24:52,444 --> 00:24:55,415
It'd be a lot easier for you
to close the store, wouldn't it?

461
00:24:55,531 --> 00:24:58,560
But instead, you're out here
trying to keep it going.

462
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,446
I think Gracie
would be proud of you.

463
00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:03,742
I think your mom would
be proud of you, too.

464
00:25:07,331 --> 00:25:10,071
When my mom died,
there was nothing I could do about it.

465
00:25:14,123 --> 00:25:16,013
But then after Mrs. Leigh...

466
00:25:19,524 --> 00:25:21,955
Mitchell Cafferty
is going to get his due

467
00:25:22,264 --> 00:25:24,425
whether Gray finds him or not.

468
00:25:25,138 --> 00:25:27,859
Sooner or later, he's going
to cross the wrong person.

469
00:25:28,302 --> 00:25:30,618
One of these days,
it's going to catch up with him.

470
00:25:34,514 --> 00:25:36,790
I don't like to drink
while I'm working.

471
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:42,964
To be honest, I have
difficulty understanding

472
00:25:43,581 --> 00:25:45,761
how many ways I dislike you.

473
00:25:47,228 --> 00:25:48,752
You made a list?

474
00:25:49,485 --> 00:25:51,530
Mrs. Green, I don't think I...

475
00:25:51,613 --> 00:25:53,648
This will work a lot better
if you just sit there

476
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:55,674
and listen to what
I have to say.

477
00:25:56,831 --> 00:25:59,802
What you and Eric
did to April was awful.

478
00:26:00,941 --> 00:26:02,832
But she's going
to get through this

479
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,436
because she is
one strong woman.

480
00:26:06,304 --> 00:26:08,176
But there's a baby on the way,

481
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,876
and it happens
to be my grandchild.

482
00:26:11,532 --> 00:26:14,214
And I intend to do
everything I can

483
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,664
to protect it from this world.

484
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,272
But what you've done,
I can't protect it from.

485
00:26:21,507 --> 00:26:23,359
You've divided the family.

486
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:26,755
And as hard as that child's
life was going to be,

487
00:26:26,756 --> 00:26:29,745
you have made it
so much more difficult.

488
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:34,009
I don't think that's something
I'll ever be able to forgive.

489
00:26:56,371 --> 00:26:58,937
When I was a kid,
my mom split on my dad and I.

490
00:26:59,072 --> 00:27:00,885
She left with the guy
she met in Denver...

491
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:02,197
This isn't about you.

492
00:27:02,327 --> 00:27:03,427
This will work a lot better

493
00:27:03,428 --> 00:27:05,954
if you just sit there
and listen to what I have to say.

494
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,350
I lay awake at night
terrified that I have

495
00:27:09,351 --> 00:27:11,549
put April in the same
position my dad was in...

496
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,288
Terrified that I have put this child

497
00:27:14,443 --> 00:27:16,719
in the same position that I was in.

498
00:27:19,092 --> 00:27:20,941
My mistake was falling
in love with your son,

499
00:27:20,942 --> 00:27:22,951
I never should have let
it happen, but I did.

500
00:27:23,564 --> 00:27:26,035
I know the cost.
I know how wrong it is.

501
00:27:27,794 --> 00:27:29,761
But the problem is,
he loves me, too.

502
00:27:30,803 --> 00:27:32,335
And I don't know
how you undo that.

503
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,793
So if you want
to go on hating me,

504
00:27:39,216 --> 00:27:40,640
if you never accept me...

505
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:44,406
I can't say as I blame you.

506
00:27:50,093 --> 00:27:51,526
So I went to find help.

507
00:27:53,021 --> 00:27:55,011
I was more messed up
than I thought.

508
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:57,952
I wandered for days.

509
00:27:58,298 --> 00:27:59,620
Eventually...

510
00:28:00,634 --> 00:28:02,759
passed out in this... field.

511
00:28:03,797 --> 00:28:04,946
So there I was,

512
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,831
the middle of Nebraska

513
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,895
feeling like that was the place
I was going to die.

514
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,282
And then,
the strangest thing happened.

515
00:28:14,752 --> 00:28:17,174
There was a...
light in the sky.

516
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:20,015
A bright light with a...

517
00:28:20,114 --> 00:28:21,708
ring around it.

518
00:28:21,881 --> 00:28:23,376
I...

519
00:28:24,365 --> 00:28:26,478
went... towards it.

520
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:29,406
Two miles later...

521
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:32,486
I stumbled into
the refugee camp.

522
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:36,724
That light...

523
00:28:37,638 --> 00:28:39,195
saved my life.

524
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:51,708
Been looking all over for you.

525
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:52,842
Did you find the part?

526
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:53,934
I think so.

527
00:28:54,841 --> 00:28:56,153
Did you see the news?

528
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,333
You looking to trade
for a mechanical governor?

529
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,111
Okay, let's talk trade.

530
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:06,470
Eight bags of salt
at 35 pound per.

531
00:29:06,471 --> 00:29:07,743
Russell, what did they think?

532
00:29:07,744 --> 00:29:09,595
That they're the first ones
to think of this?

533
00:29:09,596 --> 00:29:12,393
These parts are in high demand.
I'm not giving it away.

534
00:29:12,394 --> 00:29:14,878
- What more is it going to take?
- What more?

535
00:29:16,017 --> 00:29:17,772
I turned away a guy
just this morning,

536
00:29:17,773 --> 00:29:20,454
and he offered 80 gallons
of diesel for the thing.

537
00:29:23,714 --> 00:29:24,988
Listen...

538
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:27,669
We have more salt
than you can imagine.

539
00:29:28,171 --> 00:29:30,216
We have the largest
salt mine for 400 miles

540
00:29:30,217 --> 00:29:31,643
and we've got men to mine it.

541
00:29:31,817 --> 00:29:33,418
But if you ever want
to see any of it,

542
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:35,771
we need to make
this deal right now, today.

543
00:29:35,772 --> 00:29:37,140
You understand?

544
00:29:41,964 --> 00:29:44,124
Okay, listen,
I'll vouch for him.

545
00:29:44,607 --> 00:29:46,131
All right?

546
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:51,584
All right.

547
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,147
We got a deal.

548
00:29:53,784 --> 00:29:56,060
Wait here. I'll go get it.

549
00:29:56,697 --> 00:29:58,586
These things aren't
easy to make, you know.

550
00:29:58,587 --> 00:30:00,401
Not the good ones anyway.

551
00:30:02,716 --> 00:30:04,819
Dad, this is Russell.

552
00:30:04,954 --> 00:30:06,902
Hi. Good to meet you.

553
00:30:25,673 --> 00:30:26,869
Mr. Mayor?

554
00:30:26,946 --> 00:30:29,358
No kidding, Dale,
I am not the mayor anymore.

555
00:30:31,711 --> 00:30:33,255
There's blood on them.

556
00:30:36,881 --> 00:30:39,293
- You need some help there?
- What the hell is this?

557
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:42,514
Are you conducting an inspection
or are we doing a deal?

558
00:30:42,515 --> 00:30:43,922
No, we're not supporting that.

559
00:30:43,923 --> 00:30:45,193
We'll find another solution.

560
00:30:45,194 --> 00:30:46,923
Well, then we're all done here,
aren't we?

561
00:30:46,924 --> 00:30:48,280
Why don't you get out?

562
00:30:49,418 --> 00:30:50,421
Get out of here.

563
00:30:50,614 --> 00:30:51,772
Get out!

564
00:30:52,196 --> 00:30:53,276
Get out!

565
00:30:53,913 --> 00:30:55,341
Get out!

566
00:30:56,885 --> 00:30:57,984
You, too!

567
00:30:58,061 --> 00:30:59,894
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

568
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,389
Guys, I'm so sorry.
We had no idea.

569
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,390
We need that part.

570
00:31:03,391 --> 00:31:05,997
- And we're going to have to figure out
a way... - Where's Dale?

571
00:31:09,141 --> 00:31:11,936
Dale, where'd you get off to?
Don't just wander off like that.

572
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:16,252
Did you steal that?

573
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,236
He's a bad guy.
He can't get away with that.

574
00:31:18,237 --> 00:31:20,563
We got to get that back before
they realize it's missing.

575
00:31:20,564 --> 00:31:22,411
It's okay I went out
the back. No one saw me.

576
00:31:22,412 --> 00:31:23,429
Hold it!

577
00:31:23,995 --> 00:31:24,995
Hold it!

578
00:31:25,449 --> 00:31:26,449
Hold it!

579
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:33,850
Hand him over.

580
00:31:34,516 --> 00:31:36,084
He made a mistake, all right?

581
00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:37,294
He'll give back what he took.

582
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,579
It's no harm done, all right?

583
00:31:45,024 --> 00:31:46,332
Excuse me. You know,

584
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:47,703
he really is sorry and

585
00:31:47,704 --> 00:31:49,333
the property is back
where it belongs.

586
00:31:49,444 --> 00:31:50,938
He can explain it to management.

587
00:31:50,987 --> 00:31:53,247
I'm just asking you,
use a little discretion,

588
00:31:53,248 --> 00:31:54,343
that's all, please.

589
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:58,652
Excuse me, but could I talk
to whoever's in charge here?

590
00:31:58,653 --> 00:32:00,096
Look, old man, I told you...

591
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:12,641
That's enough!

592
00:32:28,632 --> 00:32:30,508
How long have you been
with the FBI?

593
00:32:30,953 --> 00:32:32,274
14 years.

594
00:32:32,348 --> 00:32:33,916
Started right out of college.

595
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,941
It's dangerous out there, isn't it?

596
00:32:36,348 --> 00:32:38,966
I don't think your mom wants me
talking to you about that.

597
00:32:39,027 --> 00:32:40,139
I'm not a kid.

598
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:42,016
It's pretty bad.

599
00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:45,781
My dad's been teaching me
how to shoot.

600
00:32:45,855 --> 00:32:46,966
I wonder if that's why.

601
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:48,470
He's been teaching you
how to shoot?

602
00:32:48,471 --> 00:32:49,482
A little.

603
00:32:49,962 --> 00:32:51,172
I'm not sure if I like it.

604
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:52,703
It's a weird feeling, but...

605
00:32:53,394 --> 00:32:54,811
it's the first time I can remember

606
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:56,911
the two of us actually doing
something together.

607
00:33:00,664 --> 00:33:01,985
Where's your father?

608
00:33:02,936 --> 00:33:04,331
It's the old man.

609
00:33:05,491 --> 00:33:07,701
He's coming for us,
using us against each other.

610
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,282
He knows where you are.

611
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:11,393
We need to go.
We need to move now.

612
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,465
No, I don't know.

613
00:33:12,551 --> 00:33:13,712
You don't know?

614
00:33:14,515 --> 00:33:16,935
This country is going
to be what we make of it.

615
00:33:17,207 --> 00:33:18,898
There are only a
handful of other people

616
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:20,331
that know what we know.

617
00:33:20,936 --> 00:33:23,628
We have to keep fighting.
We have to stay alive.

618
00:33:25,329 --> 00:33:28,577
We go see him, and if,
if he is behind this,

619
00:33:28,663 --> 00:33:29,775
we take him out.

620
00:33:30,194 --> 00:33:31,342
Take him out?

621
00:33:31,441 --> 00:33:33,121
Yeah, I mean,
how long can we run?

622
00:33:33,182 --> 00:33:35,467
How long can my family run?

623
00:33:37,295 --> 00:33:38,554
We pay him a visit,

624
00:33:38,555 --> 00:33:39,801
we eliminate the threat.

625
00:33:39,802 --> 00:33:42,703
We go straight at him, there is
a chance we don't come back.

626
00:33:51,668 --> 00:33:53,137
You're leaving.

627
00:33:54,805 --> 00:33:57,459
She walked in that door,
I knew right away you'd be leaving.

628
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,856
You have nothing to worry about.

629
00:34:04,301 --> 00:34:06,140
It's not me that
I'm worried about.

630
00:34:06,288 --> 00:34:08,078
Our children need a father.

631
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:12,469
Whatever you're going to do,
it can't be more important than that.

632
00:34:15,843 --> 00:34:17,164
Do you trust her?

633
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,511
I have to.

634
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,804
If she's a threat to this
family's safety,

635
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:28,496
if she's a threat to you...

636
00:34:29,508 --> 00:34:30,619
you kill her.

637
00:34:33,015 --> 00:34:34,115
You understand?

638
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:49,489
Get in!

639
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:50,628
Hurry!

640
00:35:03,763 --> 00:35:04,820
Stop the car.

641
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,950
Jake, this car will not fit
through that barricade.

642
00:35:08,246 --> 00:35:09,629
Stop the car now!

643
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,852
Thanks. I, uh,

644
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,633
I don't know how this would have
turned out if it weren't for you guys.

645
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:36,234
- Well, you'll make it up to us someday.
- However we can help.

646
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:38,644
Those windmills you're looking
to build... I was thinking.

647
00:35:38,645 --> 00:35:40,401
Guys down at the
old brake assembly,

648
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:42,214
maybe they can convert
part of their plant,

649
00:35:42,484 --> 00:35:43,526
help build what you need.

650
00:35:43,584 --> 00:35:45,706
I know the town could use
a good source of salt.

651
00:35:46,956 --> 00:35:49,252
Looks like we're going
to be seeing a lot of each other.

652
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:51,480
- Thanks again, guys. Take care.
- Thank you so much.

653
00:35:57,205 --> 00:35:58,285
What?

654
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:07,277
Jake, I saw the governor.

655
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,820
I saw how it's put together.

656
00:36:09,071 --> 00:36:10,286
I was talking to Ted,

657
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:13,199
and I think between the two of us,
we can help to make more of them,

658
00:36:13,836 --> 00:36:15,090
but I have to go with him.

659
00:36:16,075 --> 00:36:18,737
- Go with them? Wait a minute.
- No, think about it.

660
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:21,380
We don't have the resources
to do this the right way.

661
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,631
They've got the machines

662
00:36:22,632 --> 00:36:24,196
and the guys who
know how to use them.

663
00:36:24,197 --> 00:36:27,007
With a dozen full-sized windmills,
you could power the whole town,

664
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,077
run the med center,
forget about gas.

665
00:36:29,078 --> 00:36:31,285
You're just going to leave?
Right now?

666
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:33,015
It won't be for very long.

667
00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:34,374
Just a few days.

668
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:36,429
But I know I can help.

669
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,128
I think I need to do this.

670
00:36:39,673 --> 00:36:41,264
You think this is a good idea?

671
00:36:44,106 --> 00:36:46,175
You know why things
didn't work out between us?

672
00:36:47,566 --> 00:36:48,956
I'm not dangerous.

673
00:36:50,068 --> 00:36:51,258
I'm crossword puzzles

674
00:36:51,259 --> 00:36:53,574
and flannel pajamas and
the occasional lite beer.

675
00:36:53,575 --> 00:36:55,598
I was never going to be
hazardous to you.

676
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,743
- That's how you tick.
- No, it isn't.

677
00:36:58,052 --> 00:36:59,396
Of course it is.

678
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:00,895
But it's okay.

679
00:37:01,206 --> 00:37:03,987
If it wasn't, your dad would
probably be dead right now,

680
00:37:04,545 --> 00:37:07,323
you and I would have
never met on that bus.

681
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,561
So I'm taking a page out of your book.

682
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:10,892
I'm throwing caution to the wind.

683
00:37:10,893 --> 00:37:13,670
I'm gonna help turn the lights
on for everyone back home.

684
00:37:16,313 --> 00:37:18,011
Just for a few days.

685
00:37:20,153 --> 00:37:21,735
You worried about me?

686
00:37:24,918 --> 00:37:26,847
Come back in one piece.

687
00:38:04,612 --> 00:38:05,615
Dad?

688
00:38:05,955 --> 00:38:07,406
We're out of the good toothpaste.

689
00:38:07,468 --> 00:38:10,817
Oh, well, here's the...
The new stuff that Mr. Daley made.

690
00:38:12,111 --> 00:38:14,565
- This isn't toothpaste.
- Yeah, it is.

691
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,494
Are you playing a joke on me?

692
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,723
Hey, you know, uh,

693
00:38:23,035 --> 00:38:25,149
when you were teething,
you never cried.

694
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,696
See, 'cause most babies,

695
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,610
they cry, but not you.

696
00:38:30,397 --> 00:38:31,617
And your...

697
00:38:31,802 --> 00:38:35,105
mom was worried and the...
doctors were worried,

698
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:37,204
but not me.

699
00:38:38,177 --> 00:38:40,384
Because I knew you weren't sick,

700
00:38:41,294 --> 00:38:42,852
you weren't hurt,

701
00:38:42,899 --> 00:38:44,473
you were just brave.

702
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:47,499
'Cause you're
the bravest person I know.

703
00:38:48,008 --> 00:38:49,582
You always have been.

704
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:51,898
Dad?

705
00:38:52,954 --> 00:38:54,806
What are you talking about?

706
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:57,584
Sam,

707
00:38:59,945 --> 00:39:01,566
I have to go to work tomorrow.

708
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:04,390
It's a very important meeting,
but it's quite far away,

709
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:06,041
so I might not be back
for a day or two,

710
00:39:06,042 --> 00:39:07,585
and I just wanted you to know that.

711
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,207
Are you mad at me?

712
00:39:11,095 --> 00:39:12,103
What?

713
00:39:12,898 --> 00:39:13,923
You're leaving.

714
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,849
You listen to me.

715
00:39:23,577 --> 00:39:24,800
There is nothing that

716
00:39:24,921 --> 00:39:26,242
you, your sister or your mother

717
00:39:26,243 --> 00:39:28,527
could ever do that would
make me want to leave you.

718
00:39:30,725 --> 00:39:31,787
I, uh...

719
00:39:34,478 --> 00:39:36,948
I, I love you.
You understand that, right?

720
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:20,919
Hey, welcome home.

721
00:40:21,684 --> 00:40:22,808
Success?

722
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:25,707
- You get the part?
- We had it...

723
00:40:26,386 --> 00:40:27,436
and we lost it.

724
00:40:28,103 --> 00:40:29,535
Uh, where's Heather?

725
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:31,607
Getting the lights back on.

726
00:40:32,027 --> 00:40:33,990
You do realize that
what happened today

727
00:40:33,991 --> 00:40:35,299
was unnecessary?

728
00:40:36,806 --> 00:40:37,892
And stupid?

729
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:40,156
You got a lot
of responsibility now.

730
00:40:40,157 --> 00:40:42,044
You're going to have to learn
how to be smart.

731
00:40:42,045 --> 00:40:43,054
I understand.

732
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,955
And you,
you knew that this car

733
00:40:47,956 --> 00:40:49,591
was not going to fit
through that gate?

734
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,177
I know.

735
00:40:51,732 --> 00:40:53,932
I heard you talking to me,
and I knew you were right.

736
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,379
Why didn't you stop the car?

737
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,289
I don't know.

738
00:40:58,928 --> 00:41:00,259
What'd you get?

739
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,803
Look at all this stuff.

740
00:41:05,082 --> 00:41:06,452
Oh, you did great.

741
00:41:06,896 --> 00:41:08,188
This is nothing.

742
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:11,252
Skylar, how much of the salt mine
does your family own?

743
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:13,452
I don't know. Why?

744
00:41:14,686 --> 00:41:16,635
'Cause I think we may be rich.

745
00:41:20,205 --> 00:41:21,613
You okay?

746
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,173
Look, uh...

747
00:41:29,774 --> 00:41:31,742
I am glad you made it.

748
00:41:33,498 --> 00:41:35,852
We leave first thing
in the morning.

749
00:42:20,267 --> 00:42:23,952
