<i>Previously on</i> Jericho

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:04,734
Oh, my God, Ted.

3
00:00:05,661 --> 00:00:08,233
- Jake, this is... Ted Lewis.
- Hey, how you doing?

4
00:00:08,272 --> 00:00:09,763
We grew up together over in New Bern.

5
00:00:09,773 --> 00:00:10,996
This is Russell and Mike.

6
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:12,173
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,911
With a dozen full-size windmills,
you could power the whole town.

8
00:00:14,937 --> 00:00:17,409
I'm gonna help turn the lights on
for everyone back home.

9
00:00:17,425 --> 00:00:19,670
- You're just going to leave?
- Won't be for very long.

10
00:00:21,908 --> 00:00:23,442
Johnston, you SOB.

11
00:00:23,755 --> 00:00:25,385
How the hell did you lose an election?

12
00:00:25,395 --> 00:00:28,049
No, the question is: how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?

13
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:30,638
- They get tired of you being sheriff?
- No, I'm still sheriff.

14
00:00:30,648 --> 00:00:32,164
Just got a little more authority.

15
00:00:32,174 --> 00:00:34,409
Does this thing work?
Can we get power from it?

16
00:00:34,419 --> 00:00:35,504
Probably sometime tomorrow.

17
00:00:35,514 --> 00:00:36,972
Let's get it up as fast as we can.

18
00:00:36,982 --> 00:00:38,471
Can we buy some more of these things?

19
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:41,144
You got one of the only salt
mines around for 400 miles.

20
00:00:41,164 --> 00:00:43,686
- We're going to need food.
- Won't see another crop till spring.

21
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:45,216
Spring crop is what I'm talking about.

22
00:00:45,232 --> 00:00:47,164
Ten wind turbines for, let's say...

23
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:48,809
ten percent of your spring crop.

24
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:50,450
No, we can't put ourselves
in that position.

25
00:00:50,481 --> 00:00:52,288
Starve next fall or freeze this winter.

26
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:54,229
Okay, look,
we'll give you the food.

27
00:00:54,307 --> 00:00:56,575
We can have the wind turbines
to you in a couple weeks.

28
00:00:56,622 --> 00:00:59,016
We're going to need ten Jericho
men to help us build them.

29
00:00:59,047 --> 00:01:01,566
Is this about manpower
for wind turbines?

30
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,672
Or is it more about making sure
you get our crops come spring?

31
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:06,873
I am not going to build
these things on credit.

32
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:09,029
You want them now?
You're going to help make them.

33
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:11,032
What you are about to do...

34
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:12,909
means this town's survival.

35
00:01:13,128 --> 00:01:14,356
All right, let's move out.

36
00:01:14,419 --> 00:01:15,984
If anything happens
to any of them...

37
00:01:16,516 --> 00:01:18,315
you're the first one I come for.

38
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,441
I know.

39
00:01:57,781 --> 00:01:59,110
<i>Hey, Jeff, they're back.

40
00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:02,380
I didn't expect to see
you till spring, Russell.

41
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:05,197
I thought you might
be needing these.

42
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:07,769
Your windmills.

43
00:02:13,288 --> 00:02:15,400
It's good to see our guys back, but...

44
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:18,881
it's going to take some time for me
to find the guys to replace them.

45
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:20,817
You don't need to replace them.

46
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,218
Well, now, wait...

47
00:02:22,297 --> 00:02:24,501
our agreement was that
we got ten windmills

48
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,680
for ten percent of the crops.

49
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:28,750
You'll get your windmills,
but we don't need your men.

50
00:02:29,078 --> 00:02:31,941
Constantino called it
an act of good faith.

51
00:02:32,831 --> 00:02:35,224
I didn't think Constantino
knew that term.

52
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,510
But...
I'll take it.

53
00:02:42,308 --> 00:02:43,309
Stanley!

54
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:47,416
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

55
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:49,399
Where's Eric?

56
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:52,982
He didn't come back, Mary.

57
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:56,363
He said he wasn't ready.

58
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,021
But...

59
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,102
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

60
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:02,523
Okay.
Thanks.

61
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:10,931
I didn't know you guys
were coming back today.

62
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,935
- None of us did.
- How are you? You okay?

63
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:16,023
Where's Eric?

64
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,772
Come here.

65
00:03:22,705 --> 00:03:24,300
He didn't come back with us.

66
00:03:25,427 --> 00:03:26,460
Why not?

67
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:29,490
When I talked to him, he was still
pretty messed up about April's death.

68
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,288
He said he was thinking about
staying in New Bern for a while

69
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:34,697
to get his head together.
- When was this?

70
00:03:34,963 --> 00:03:36,262
Three days ago.

71
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:39,276
Then, he didn't show up for work,
and I haven't seen him since.

72
00:03:39,448 --> 00:03:41,310
I don't know what's
going on in New Bern.

73
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:43,464
When I asked about Eric,
they couldn't tell me anything.

74
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:46,457
Then, the cops started escorting
us wherever we went.

75
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,278
Then today, out of nowhere,
Russell says,

76
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:50,139
"Pack it up, we're going home",
like...

77
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,972
like it wasn't safe for us
there anymore.

78
00:03:58,344 --> 00:03:59,611
Where's my brother?

79
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:02,662
- I don't know.
- What?

80
00:04:03,257 --> 00:04:04,978
I know he hasn't been
seen for a few days.

81
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:06,417
Did you even try to find him?

82
00:04:06,558 --> 00:04:08,248
- I asked Constantino.
- And?

83
00:04:08,773 --> 00:04:11,041
And he told me that
they were looking for him.

84
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:13,967
And then this morning, he told me
to bring the rest of your guys home.

85
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:16,141
What the hell's going on
over there, Russell?

86
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:19,192
Should I be worried about him?

87
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:22,063
Answer me.
Should I be worried?

88
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,572
I would be.

89
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:30,265
- I'm going with you.
- No...

90
00:04:30,782 --> 00:04:32,138
you've been gone for weeks.
Go home.

91
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:33,885
You need someone who knows
their way around New Bern.

92
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:35,163
I'll try to find Heather
as soon as I get there.

93
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:36,623
She knows it better than any of us.

94
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:38,422
Look, it's not safe out there.

95
00:04:38,438 --> 00:04:39,752
You can't go by yourself.

96
00:04:40,174 --> 00:04:41,175
I'm not.

97
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:46,918
I need your help.

102
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:05,520
You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china, Jake.

103
00:05:05,577 --> 00:05:07,971
I got to try and find him.
I can't just...

104
00:05:09,697 --> 00:05:12,446
There's something going on in that town.
I can feel it.

105
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,437
Stanley starts asking questions,
and they just send them home?

106
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:18,971
Okay, but you understand why
I can't just up and leave, right?

107
00:05:21,284 --> 00:05:23,214
- He's my brother.
- And you said he was upset,

108
00:05:23,224 --> 00:05:25,470
so maybe he just...
- If you're saying no, just say no.

109
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,619
Come on, Jake, I'm not saying no.

110
00:05:28,585 --> 00:05:30,478
I'm saying we got to
understand the situation.

111
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:31,964
The situation is...

112
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:34,914
he's been missing for three days,
and I came to you...

113
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:36,416
for help.

114
00:05:39,584 --> 00:05:40,585
Okay.

115
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,676
But if we do this,
we do it my way.

116
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:02,884
Oh, my God.

117
00:06:15,098 --> 00:06:16,303
I'm so glad you're home.

118
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,930
I missed you guys so much.

119
00:06:24,508 --> 00:06:25,619
You're totally back.

120
00:06:27,606 --> 00:06:28,639
<i>Mrs. Green.

121
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:32,143
I'm really sorry to bother
you like this, but...

122
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:33,815
I thought you should know.

123
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:34,980
Know what?

124
00:06:35,535 --> 00:06:38,868
The men came back from New Bern,
and Eric wasn't with them.

125
00:06:39,456 --> 00:06:40,458
Why not?

126
00:06:41,115 --> 00:06:43,243
He decided to stay a little longer.

127
00:06:43,305 --> 00:06:45,636
Decided to or Constantino insisted?

128
00:06:47,154 --> 00:06:49,423
Stanley talked to him.
He said...

129
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:52,028
he said he wasn't ready
to come home.

130
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:59,232
- How'd you hurt your hand?
- Oh, I just...

131
00:06:59,263 --> 00:07:01,595
was trying to fix the copper
tubing on my still.

132
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:03,045
It just popped off and cut me.

133
00:07:03,076 --> 00:07:05,235
Is alcohol really a priority right now?

134
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:07,373
Actually, it's not to drink.

135
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:10,258
I was trying to make antiseptic
for the med center.

136
00:07:12,753 --> 00:07:13,754
I should go.

137
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:16,867
- You got any sand over there
at the bar?  - Sand?

138
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:20,325
Yeah, I think I can show you a way
around that copper tubing.

139
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:22,406
I'll just give you a hand.

140
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:27,424
See you in a bit.

141
00:07:33,226 --> 00:07:35,150
Guys... yo, listen.

142
00:07:35,682 --> 00:07:38,310
Stop unloading that.
Put that back.

143
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:44,884
What the hell is this?

144
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,762
- Salt.  - Who gave you permission
to take it from the mine?

145
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:49,781
51% of the mine belongs to me.

146
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:51,377
I just took it from my half.

147
00:07:51,517 --> 00:07:54,568
You don't have a half...
of anything. Your parents do.

148
00:07:54,702 --> 00:07:57,174
Look, I know you still think
of me as a child...

149
00:07:57,205 --> 00:07:59,286
and I can't help it if that's
where you're stuck,

150
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:01,790
but the fact is I have
a right to what I own.

151
00:08:01,883 --> 00:08:04,464
You are a minor and
you don't own anything

152
00:08:04,474 --> 00:08:06,726
as long as your parents
are still alive.

153
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:09,698
Or do you have some information
that I don't have?

154
00:08:12,342 --> 00:08:14,352
Look, just... just take
the salt back to the mine

155
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:17,027
and don't make me have to
send my guys to do it.

156
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,393
Proof of residence?

157
00:08:41,995 --> 00:08:43,098
We're not from here.

158
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:45,323
Sorry, you're going to need
to turn this car around

159
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,174
and proceed back
the way you came.

160
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,538
I'm here to see my brother.
His name is Eric Green.

161
00:08:50,548 --> 00:08:52,470
You're not hearing me, sir.
No one's allowed...

162
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,328
No, you're not hearing me.
I have to see him.

163
00:08:54,338 --> 00:08:56,864
He came here as part of the deal
you made with Jericho. Now...

164
00:08:56,874 --> 00:08:58,121
Hey, Jake...

165
00:09:02,272 --> 00:09:03,853
I want to talk to Phil Constantino.

166
00:09:03,884 --> 00:09:05,761
- Get out of the car.
- Hell, no.

167
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,959
Put your hands on the dashboard.

168
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,252
I want to see your hands.

169
00:09:12,043 --> 00:09:14,913
That's Johnston Green's son.
Let him through.

170
00:09:17,517 --> 00:09:20,130
I'll escort him in
to see Sheriff Constantino.

171
00:09:25,418 --> 00:09:26,873
Go ahead, let him through.

172
00:09:44,574 --> 00:09:45,594
<i>Mister, Mister.

173
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,167
Do you have any food?

174
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:48,734
I'm sorry, I don't...

175
00:09:48,744 --> 00:09:50,155
I'm sorry, I don't have any.

176
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:53,273
All right, ma'am, come on.
Get those kids out of there.

177
00:09:53,352 --> 00:09:54,380
Hey, come on.

178
00:09:54,697 --> 00:09:55,722
<i>Come on, please.

179
00:10:02,153 --> 00:10:03,765
I thought we had it bad.

180
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,725
What the hell happened here?

181
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:24,131
Ravenwood.

182
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,670
My brother is missing.

183
00:10:27,713 --> 00:10:29,807
I know. I've got patrols
out looking for him.

184
00:10:29,878 --> 00:10:31,146
- And no leads?
- No.

185
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:33,677
Sorry, I wish there's
more I could do.

186
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:36,042
You're the sheriff and the mayor.
You can do more.

187
00:10:36,085 --> 00:10:37,224
I'm trying, Jake.

188
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,435
You sure Eric even
wants to be found?

189
00:10:39,492 --> 00:10:40,760
What's that supposed to mean?

190
00:10:40,859 --> 00:10:43,196
We all knew April.
We know what happened.

191
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,560
Last I heard that Eric was
having a tough time.

192
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:47,426
He'll be fine as soon as
we get him home.

193
00:10:47,498 --> 00:10:49,777
You know what?
Let's face the facts.

194
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:51,260
He might have been attacked.

195
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,027
Could be lying in a
ditch somewhere.

196
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:55,292
- Why would you say...
- Take it easy!

197
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,942
The fact is some folks around here
aren't too fond of Jericho these days.

198
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:03,280
That's why I sent the workers home
today. When your brother went missing,

199
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,678
I got worried for their safety.

200
00:11:04,803 --> 00:11:05,804
Why?

201
00:11:06,023 --> 00:11:09,184
There's been a lot of rumors
flying around about your town.

202
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:10,733
What are people saying?

203
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:13,649
They're mad that Jericho didn't
warn us about Ravenwood.

204
00:11:13,743 --> 00:11:16,716
They think you're going to renege
on your part of the food deal.

205
00:11:16,825 --> 00:11:18,531
We've had it rough here, okay?

206
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,174
They're just looking for
somebody to blame.

207
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:22,650
- Where was Eric last seen?
- The factory.

208
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,964
End of his shift.

209
00:11:24,465 --> 00:11:26,248
Look, we're just trying to help.

210
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:29,464
What is it that you want
that we're not giving?

211
00:11:30,762 --> 00:11:32,702
I want to talk to Heather Lisinski.

212
00:11:35,206 --> 00:11:37,021
<i>Take care of each other, Kansas.

213
00:11:39,896 --> 00:11:41,585
Anything new from Mr. Hewitt?

214
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:45,982
No, it's just the same bulletin about
the riots in Chicago Camp West.

215
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,008
Hey, thanks for taking on a shift.

216
00:11:48,227 --> 00:11:51,168
Jimmy, it's the least I can do
to make myself useful.

217
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:54,149
I feel like such a freeloader
sitting around your house all day.

218
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,181
You kidding me?

219
00:11:55,635 --> 00:11:57,637
You're like the best houseguest ever.

220
00:11:57,978 --> 00:12:01,240
You cook, you do the dishes, you
never get bored playing Boggle.

221
00:12:01,302 --> 00:12:04,541
And we're dreading the day you
and your husband work things out.

222
00:12:06,014 --> 00:12:08,611
That sounded a lot less
insensitive in my head.

223
00:12:08,642 --> 00:12:11,052
- I'm sorry.
- No, I understand, thank you.

224
00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:14,123
Listen...

225
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,298
can I talk you about something?

226
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:18,144
Yeah, what is it?

227
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,679
Last night Sam and Woody were

228
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,118
drawing pictures.

229
00:12:24,463 --> 00:12:25,793
That's one of Sam's.

230
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,004
I didn't want to bring it up at
the house with everyone around,

231
00:12:32,373 --> 00:12:34,141
I thought it might be upsetting.

232
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,317
No, I'm glad you showed
this to me.

233
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,116
I'm not a psychiatrist,

234
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:44,166
but that really looks like a kid
dealing with some kind of trauma.

235
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:48,328
I'm-I'm not surprised.
I mean....

236
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,631
30 million people died a few months ago.

237
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:53,303
I'll bet there's kids all over the
country still trying to process that.

238
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:55,747
Maybe, but it's so specific.

239
00:12:56,968 --> 00:12:58,798
The bodies, the house.

240
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:02,715
He's coming by after school.
I'll talk to him then.

241
00:13:03,246 --> 00:13:05,296
- Thank you.
- Sure.

242
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:15,536
Sand keeps the copper from buckling.

243
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:18,368
How'd you learn this?

244
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:20,344
Well...

245
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:25,053
like... most things that
are fun and illegal...

246
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:26,680
from my dad.

247
00:13:27,678 --> 00:13:29,868
So the stories Eric tells are true.

248
00:13:30,322 --> 00:13:31,323
Afraid so.

249
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:37,510
You remember that book...

250
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,659
something about...
women are from Venus,

251
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:42,510
and men are wrong.

252
00:13:43,707 --> 00:13:46,257
Not that I read the book, mind you,
but I did,  you know...

253
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:48,475
flip through Gail's copy of it.

254
00:13:49,885 --> 00:13:52,450
Lot of stuff in there about
men needing to...

255
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:56,111
go off and hold up in
a cave sometime.

256
00:13:58,632 --> 00:14:01,894
Now, I don't know if this was
actually in the book, but...

257
00:14:02,563 --> 00:14:05,327
if men can't find a cave,
they'll make one.

258
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,479
Out of...

259
00:14:06,738 --> 00:14:09,867
whatever circumstances happen
to be lying around.

260
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,348
Yeah, you're probably right.

261
00:14:13,757 --> 00:14:15,212
I'm sure that's all it is.

262
00:14:19,014 --> 00:14:20,907
This isn't your fault, Mary.

263
00:14:22,034 --> 00:14:23,770
It wasn't anybody's fault.

264
00:14:25,453 --> 00:14:27,565
I think Eric's figuring that out.

265
00:14:32,196 --> 00:14:35,583
This place is the only reason New Bern
made it through the Depression.

266
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:38,266
The factory whistle's like
a heartbeat to this town.

267
00:14:39,032 --> 00:14:41,426
Put the wind turbines binds
together just down here.

268
00:14:41,598 --> 00:14:42,599
Sheriff!

269
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:45,830
Who's that?

270
00:14:45,908 --> 00:14:48,177
It's a friend of Heather's.
We met him at Black Jack.

271
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:49,379
Good news.

272
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:52,336
- This guy knows where your brother is.
- Really? Where?

273
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,431
Eric went home.

274
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:56,529
He and Heather both.
They... left this morning.

275
00:14:56,764 --> 00:14:59,236
- Home? To Jericho?
- Why would they do that?

276
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:01,399
Why didn't they go
with the convoy?

277
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,262
Well, Heather had to talk
him into going. So...

278
00:15:04,685 --> 00:15:06,108
by then, the other guys had left.

279
00:15:06,124 --> 00:15:08,127
So, I lent them my car
and my rifle.

280
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:10,020
They didn't seem worried at all.

281
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:11,963
Probably back in Jericho by now.

282
00:15:13,558 --> 00:15:14,560
Right.

283
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:18,158
- Hope they're okay.
- Thank you.

284
00:15:18,236 --> 00:15:20,333
- We got to clear the building.
- All right.

285
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,390
What happened?

286
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,245
We had to retrofit all the
machines after the EMP,

287
00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:27,186
and one of them overheated.
Caught part of the building on fire.

288
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:28,610
You got what you need?

289
00:15:29,455 --> 00:15:30,956
Yeah, mystery solved, I guess.

290
00:15:31,007 --> 00:15:32,228
Good. Glad to hear it.

291
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,246
If there's nothing else, Deputy Perkins
will escort you out of town.

292
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,280
No. We don't need
to be escorted.

293
00:15:36,874 --> 00:15:37,891
It's policy.

294
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,237
You're big on policy.

295
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,237
We almost lost everything when
Ravenwood came through here.

296
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:45,631
I'm big on anything that
keeps us alive.

297
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:50,595
- Thanks.
- No problem.

298
00:15:56,836 --> 00:15:57,838
Move the truck.

299
00:15:58,182 --> 00:15:59,308
Let them through.

300
00:15:59,512 --> 00:16:01,733
- You buying any of that story?
- Nope.

301
00:16:03,298 --> 00:16:04,899
Neither was Ted.

302
00:16:06,072 --> 00:16:08,372
Slipped me this when
he shook my hand.

303
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:11,970
- It's an address and...
- "Come Alone"

304
00:16:15,122 --> 00:16:16,530
So, we done here?

305
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,152
<i>Back it up.

306
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,736
<i>Let them through.

307
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:39,946
How long have I been gone?

308
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:41,504
No, before you answer that,

309
00:16:41,644 --> 00:16:44,054
how long has he been here?
- It's very recent really.

310
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:45,790
He hasn't been here that long.

311
00:16:46,118 --> 00:16:48,402
I asked you to do one
thing for me, Mimi.

312
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:49,685
One thing!

313
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:52,968
You know, you listen
to me, Stanley.

314
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:55,017
Your sister is not a child anymore.

315
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:57,661
You can't just throw this fit
and kick Sean's ass

316
00:16:57,677 --> 00:16:59,054
and think that's going
to be the end of it

317
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,742
I hope you're going to
explain why I can't.

318
00:17:00,752 --> 00:17:01,941
Because if you do,

319
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,851
she's just going to latch
on that much tighter.

320
00:17:05,383 --> 00:17:06,588
Unless they really get angry,

321
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:09,133
in which case, the age-old teenage
remedy is to run away,

322
00:17:09,143 --> 00:17:11,104
which used to mean that they'd
hear from them in a couple of days

323
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,416
when they ran out of bus money.

324
00:17:12,714 --> 00:17:14,435
Nowadays, chances are much better

325
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,688
that you'll find their bodies
on the side of a road.

326
00:17:18,924 --> 00:17:19,926
Look...

327
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,991
right now it is under our roof.

328
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:24,432
And it's a pain in the ass, I know,

329
00:17:24,697 --> 00:17:27,107
but it's a safe and manageable
pain in the ass,

330
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,890
and I suggest you let it stay here

331
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,398
before it turns into anything
more than that.

332
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:09,070
That's Perkins' truck.

333
00:18:09,414 --> 00:18:11,746
What's he doing staking
out Ted's trailer?

334
00:18:12,622 --> 00:18:13,639
Let's ask him.

335
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:26,806
Hand your gun to my friend,
and let's pay Ted a little visit.

336
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,305
Come on.

337
00:18:37,652 --> 00:18:38,836
Where's my brother?

338
00:18:38,846 --> 00:18:40,061
I don't know, ask him.

339
00:18:40,438 --> 00:18:42,942
He threatened to throw me in jail this
morning if I didn't feed you that lie.

340
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:45,095
- So you haven't seen Eric?
- No. Not for days.

341
00:18:45,105 --> 00:18:47,348
- What about Heather?
- She left for work this morning.

342
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:49,161
Next thing I know, they tell
me she's gone missing, too.

343
00:18:49,176 --> 00:18:51,147
Two people disappear,
nobody knows anything?

344
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:52,599
Oh, somebody does.

345
00:18:54,523 --> 00:18:55,525
Right?

346
00:18:58,873 --> 00:18:59,890
Where is he?

347
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:02,518
Screw you.

348
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,491
Hey, come on, Jake,
we got to be smarter than that.

349
00:19:05,538 --> 00:19:06,743
We need answers.

350
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:12,328
Getting answers...
is easy.

351
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:15,175
It's getting the truth...

352
00:19:15,973 --> 00:19:17,037
that takes work.

353
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,350
When did you last see Eric Green?

354
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,450
Look...

355
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,350
this is not my thing.

356
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,050
I didn't ask you that, did I?

357
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,150
Why do you act like
we did something wrong?

358
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,550
We were attacked.

359
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,150
How do you figure that?

360
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,850
The those machines didn't overheat

361
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,250
this morning at the factory.

362
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,650
It was his brother...

363
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,850
and that girl.

364
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,350
They sabotaged it.

365
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,350
They would never do that?
We need that factory

366
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,750
just as much as you do.

367
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,050
- I saw them.
- If you saw them, then where are they?

368
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,950
They ran away.

369
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,850
Hold his knees, please.

370
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,750
Look,

371
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,850
why would I be staking out

372
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,550
a trailer park if we had them? Huh?

373
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,050
Constantino put us on alert.
He gave a SOS.

374
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,850
- SOS?
- Shoot on sight.

375
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,450
Look at me.

376
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,250
What is in that factory?

377
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:45,850
I don't know.

378
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,550
No, I'm a cop. I'm a cop.
Ask Constantino.

379
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,950
Ask Constantino.

380
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,250
He knows?

381
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,050
Look at me.

382
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,950
- We go to the factory.
- But Eric...

383
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,350
I don't know about Eric.

384
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,650
But we cannot search this whole town.

385
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,850
So we should go and see what it was
that he was risking his life for.

386
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,150
All right.

387
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,150
You got some place safe you can go?

388
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,550
Yeah, my grandfather has
an old hunting cabin.

389
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:31,250
You take what's important because
you are not coming back here.

390
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,750
Get up.

391
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,750
On your knees.

392
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:45,950
What is he doing?

393
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,850
- Down on your knees.
- What?

394
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,450
What are you doing?

395
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,550
Hawkins!

396
00:22:16,016 --> 00:22:17,484
Is that doing it your way?

397
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,550
You asked me to come along.

398
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:22,450
- What were you going to do?
- You want the truth?

399
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,450
Less than you would have.

400
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,050
You see, I've done...

401
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,450
I've done enough, Jake,
to know better.

402
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,150
It's the fear of torture
that gets results.

403
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:36,050
Actual torture only works
in the movies.

404
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,550
And this one guy, he was
so skinny, you could

405
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,650
count his ribs through his shirt.

406
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,950
I tried to give him food when I could,
but none of us had much so...

407
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,350
And then one day, I could just...

408
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,050
see it in his eyes.
He'd, uh...

409
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,550
he'd given up.

410
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,350
I never thought I'd be so
thankful to live on a farm.

411
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,050
From now on, I promise
I'll only complain intermittently.

412
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,450
Well, we don't have much, but, uh...

413
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,850
we'll always have enough, so...

414
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,250
Dude, all they need to do
is get the Internet back up.

415
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,650
After that, it's a piece of cake.

416
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,350
Why is that?

417
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,150
Well, you could do anything.

418
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,150
I mean, you could run for president.
Make a virtual White House.

419
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,850
Fly a plane into that.

420
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,450
I mean, virtual cities and towns...

421
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,750
nothing to nuke.
- Yeah, but...

422
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,550
where would we get...

423
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:40,850
stuff?

424
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,350
What stuff?

425
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,450
I don't know.

426
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,950
Food, clothes, blankets, fuel.

427
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:47,750
Not a problem.

428
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,950
After the Internet is back up,
you just order all that stuff.

429
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,750
You know, Stanley,
you would not believe

430
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,650
how helpful Sean has been
around here with the livestock,

431
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,150
and the house,
and... just everything.

432
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,550
It's true.

433
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,850
Yeah, it's weird, Stanley, 'cause

434
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,150
I am much more of a vibe guy.

435
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,650
What the hell is a vibe guy?

436
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,450
You know...

437
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,450
I mean, I've never been into, like,

438
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,850
physical labor.

439
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,850
I'm more the guy that people
have around for my vibe.

440
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,650
My house, my rules, my vibe.

441
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,050
And you sleep there.

442
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:02,150
So anyhow, it's, like, 3:00 a. m.,
I've got this flashlight in my face.

443
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:05,050
Gail's over on her side of
the bed trying to find the phone

444
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,250
to call the cops and finally,
I located the light switch.

445
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,550
It's Eric,

446
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,150
who's standing there and he says,

447
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,650
"I can't go to sleep until
I confess I'm drunk. "

448
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,250
I said, "You're what?"

449
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,750
He said, "I'm drunk."

450
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:23,550
"It won't ever happen again.
I don't know what I was thinking."

451
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,050
Well, meantime,
he looks perfectly normal,

452
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,950
his speech isn't slurred or anything.

453
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:31,650
Gail starts grilling him. Turns out
he has had a beer and a half.

454
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,350
I said to him,
"Son, do you have any idea

455
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,150
how much beer it takes to get drunk?"

456
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,950
He said, "No, I don't. "

457
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,150
I said, "Well, get out of here and

458
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,750
don't wake me up again until you do."

459
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:48,450
He left, Gail and
I just could not stop laughing.

460
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,450
She doesn't laugh too much anymore.

461
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:07,850
Here I am rambling on. We probably ought
to go take a look at that still.

462
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,450
Good idea.

463
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,450
Hey, buddy.

464
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,250
Your mom just ran to the little
girls' room. Why don't you grab a seat?

465
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,050
Could you give us a minute?

466
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,750
Sure.

467
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,150
Say, you know what?

468
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:36,350
Why don't we go sit in my office,
maybe we can talk.

469
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,550
About what?

470
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,650
About your artwork.

471
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,550
This is Russell.

472
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,650
He saved our butts out
at the Black Jack.

473
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,450
Hi. It's nice to meet you. I'm Skylar.

474
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,750
Stevens, right?

475
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,250
Something we can help you with?

476
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,750
Well, I was thinking
we could help each other.

477
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,350
You've got a salt mine
with no real distributor.

478
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:09,050
I've got men, trucks, guns,

479
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,450
but no supplies.

480
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,850
- If we become partners...
- Partners?

481
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,050
I'm asking for half
your share of the mine.

482
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,850
We're doing okay now.

483
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:22,450
Okay, but the people in Jericho,
they only need so much salt.

484
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,450
I've been out there.

485
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,050
I know the trade routes,
where to find the highest bidders

486
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,950
and how to make it
back here in one piece.

487
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,650
What's in it for us?

488
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,150
Bigger profits.

489
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:38,050
Where I'm going, I can get you
five times what you can make here.

490
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,450
And...

491
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,450
I'll deal with Gray Anderson for you.

492
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,550
When do you need an answer?

493
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,250
Before I leave in the morning.

494
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,750
Believe me,

495
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,850
this is good for everyone.

496
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,850
It's a full inventory of Jericho.

497
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,750
It's our mine.

498
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,050
And our town.

499
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,350
They sliced it up like they own it.

500
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,650
What do they know that we don't?

501
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,150
Come on.

502
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,350
Hey, sweetie.
What's going on?

503
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,550
We were talking about my drawings.

504
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,450
Look, do you mind waiting
in the lobby a minute?

505
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:13,250
I just need to talk to
Mr. Taylor alone. Okay?

506
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,650
What are you doing?

507
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,450
Darcy, something going on,
and it's not just about the bombs.

508
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,850
My son has enough to deal with,
you know, without

509
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,650
being poked and prodded.

510
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,450
If there's a problem with him,
I'll take care of it myself.

511
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,650
Right.

512
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,950
Thank you.

513
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,750
For what?

514
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,550
Letting Sean stay.

515
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,450
You're welcome.

516
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:53,750
And for not calling him an idiot
even when he is done.

517
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,650
Okay, if you know that...

518
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,650
Sorry. Just a little frog
in my throat.

519
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,350
Don't let me interrupt your nice

520
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,350
sibling-bonding moment.

521
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,250
That's what it is, right?

522
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,250
Sean can be an idiot,

523
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,350
but he can also be really great.

524
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,650
All guys are like that,

525
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:20,550
you have to put up with the
"idiot" stuff...

526
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,550
to get to the "great" stuff.

527
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:30,150
Yeah? And where did you come
by that litlle pearl of wisdom?

528
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,950
What did she say about me?

529
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,050
When did he learn how to sign?

530
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,750
He's sleeping with a deaf girl.

531
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,250
That's my sister.

532
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,350
I guess if Sean Henthorn is
my biggest problem, then

533
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,150
I'm a pretty lucky guy.

534
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,250
Want to get luckier?

535
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,850
What are you doing?

536
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,950
It's binding.

537
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,050
The lawyer said it makes me
an emancipated minor.

538
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,150
By declaring your parents dead?

539
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,350
This is wrong

540
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,544
in every way that
something can be wrong.

541
00:33:24,554 --> 00:33:26,708
- Let's just forget about this.
- You can't do that.

542
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:27,850
- It's legal.
- So,

543
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:32,048
what, are you gonna pedal your little
bike to Topeka and file this, Dale?

544
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,950
Forget that I'm the mayor.

545
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,250
Okay, I'm speaking to you as
your parents' friend.

546
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,750
My parents would want me to have
my share of the salt mine

547
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,550
Your parents are coming back.

548
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:44,050
And if it turns out that
that is not true,

549
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,250
then I will help you learn the business.

550
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,950
And who decides when that happens?

551
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,150
You?

552
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,550
I mean my decision, are you saying
laws don't apply any more?

553
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,050
You didn't make a decision.
You signed a piece of paper.

554
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:58,050
Do you really want your parents
to be dead that badly?

555
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,750
- Okay, stop it.
- No.

556
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:00,950
You're advising her, Dale.

557
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,050
Did you also tell her
how her parents died?

558
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,450
Because New York survived,

559
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,915
so I guess you probably had
to get pretty creative, right?

560
00:34:06,954 --> 00:34:08,250
Were they killed there?

561
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,050
Or were they murdered
on their way back

562
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,550
to the child who meant
everything to them?

563
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:16,150
It's just a piece of paper.

564
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,550
Come on.

565
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,650
They're making mortar rounds.

566
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:53,750
They're running a munitions factory.

567
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,850
Hurry up.
Constantino wants those tonight.

568
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,150
We'll have them ready.

569
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,850
They're getting ready for war.

570
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,050
We need to get back to town.

571
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,250
No, we need to try and stop them.
Cover me.

572
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,750
Hey, there he goes.
Down there.

573
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,750
Hold it!

574
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:56,950
Hand it over.

575
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,750
Sorry. I guess I'm late for dinner.

576
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,350
Or lunch.

577
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,150
Take your pick.

578
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,450
I was helping Mary.
It took longer than I expected.

579
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,550
You told Eric we'd take care of her.

580
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,550
What I meant was that
we'd help keep her alive.

581
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,050
What I didn't mean was that
we'd run over there

582
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,150
and spend the entire day
every time she needed

583
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,550
somebody to do
a little heavy lifting.

584
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,650
Wait.

585
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,450
You don't think
I'm the reason Eric left?

586
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,150
Do you?

587
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,750
Is that what you think?

588
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,550
I think Eric left for
a lot of reasons...

589
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:47,250
...but Mary may be why he comes back.

590
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,850
I don't want to have to come back
to this house again.

591
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,550
Did you get all the toys you want?

592
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,450
So,

593
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,350
what did you and Mr. Taylor
talk about today?

594
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,650
Nothing.

595
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,850
Now, Sam, you know we don't keep
secrets in this family.

596
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,150
Yeah, I know, baby.

597
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,150
What's he doing here?

598
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,950
I think we should talk.

599
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,650
Hey, Sam, honey,
why don't you go upstairs

600
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,050
to your room and
get that last box, okay?

601
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,350
Hey, buddy.

602
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:53,050
Look, I-I understand, you know,
you being curious about my family.

603
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,450
We haven't made a lot of friends here.

604
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,950
We just kind of keep to ourselves, but

605
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,550
if you want to ask any questions,
just talk to me, okay?

606
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:02,850
Leave my children out of it.

607
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:06,250
But I think Sam's trying to say
something with that drawing.

608
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,850
Something he can't put into words.

609
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,350
What do you mean?

610
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:18,050
He's drawing a little boy
that's afraid...

611
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:23,450
...because his dad's not
around to protect him

612
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,050
or his family.

613
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,550
I told him he's not alone.

614
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,750
I know what it's like to have
parents who have split up.

615
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:34,150
I told him
I'd been through it, and...

616
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,750
I think I turned out okay, so...

617
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:39,250
I think you turned out better
than okay, Jimmy.

618
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,750
I appreciate that.

619
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:44,450
So, I guess I'll head back
to the house then.

620
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,750
See you there.

621
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,350
Thank you, Jimmy.

622
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:48,550
Sure.

623
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,050
- How did it go?
- Good.

624
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,650
Turbines all went up without a hitch.

625
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,050
Thank...

626
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,150
Thank you.

627
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,150
You were as good as your word.
Even better.

628
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,350
I'm glad you see it that way,

629
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:14,250
because I have another
proposition for you.

630
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,250
We need salt.

631
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:19,350
Well, it's no problem.
I'll have my guys load up your truck.

632
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,850
Well, actually,

633
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,450
I mean to help you sell it.

634
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,150
We were thinking
a quarter stake in the mine.

635
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,950
Would we be Constantino?

636
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,750
Is that what all of
this good will was about?

637
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,350
No. Hear me out.

638
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,350
This will work for both of us.

639
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,650
For both of our towns.

640
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,550
If you agree to let me sell salt
from the mine.

641
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,250
I'm sorry.

642
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:55,650
I guess you and the, uh, Olsen twins
think this is kind of cute.

643
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:58,750
Well, for whatever it's worth,
we did conduct a legal transaction.

644
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:00,550
- Not for sale.
- Your people on New Bern

645
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,649
who think it should be.
- I don't care what they think.

646
00:41:02,707 --> 00:41:04,150
You need to.

647
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:13,750
When I saw that

648
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,950
map of Jericho,

649
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,850
I asked Heather about it.

650
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,450
She didn't think

651
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,850
New Bern could do that to us.

652
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,650
Then she snuck in, and, uh...

653
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,150
she saw the mortars and...

654
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,250
their plans.

655
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,950
Look, you're going back to whatever

656
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,550
rock you crawled out from under.

657
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,850
Dan, get in here!

658
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,650
Mr. Mayor, there's a lot more
going on here than you realize.

659
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,650
- Is that so?
- I'm trying to help you.

660
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,750
Look, New Bern barely
survived the winter.

661
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:45,350
And the people there, they know
the food is coming from you.

662
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:48,350
And they also know that it's not going
to be enough to feed everyone,

663
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:51,350
and so, some of them, they're thinking,
what can we do about that

664
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,550
right now?

665
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,250
I want you to find every deputy you can
and get them up to the salt mine.

666
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,950
I want it under heavy guard
until further notice.

667
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,650
Gray, I've already got men up there.

668
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,750
Gray, listen to me.

669
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,050
This deal is a good thing.

670
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,650
I know you don't see it that way
right now, but please,

671
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:13,150
you do not want the alternative.

672
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,550
These rumors about Jericho,

673
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,250
about the food hoarding,

674
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,550
about how they sicced Ravenwood on us...

675
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:25,250
maybe they're not just rumors.

676
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,550
We restored their power supply,

677
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,750
and now that Jericho has what it needs,

678
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,850
it has no intention of making good
on its half of the deal.

679
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,750
Why didn't you just leave town?

680
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,650
'Cause we wanted to break the machine,

681
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,450
stop the factory.

682
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,950
Then they caught us.

683
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:47,550
They brought me here.

684
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,550
So, where is she?

685
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,550
Where is Heather?

686
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,750
She's dead, Jake.

687
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,650
But it's not enough for them
to keep their food

688
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,050
and leave us to starve.

689
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,850
You, up. You, too.

690
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,750
They want to see us destroyed.

691
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,850
I looked their mayor in the eye,

692
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:18,450
I told him how desperate
our situation was.

693
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,350
But on the day

694
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,850
that we made good
on our end of the deal,

695
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,450
what did they do?

696
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,950
They tried to destroy the factory

697
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:28,750
that keeps this town alive.

698
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,050
Here's your proof.

699
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:35,350
These are the sons of Johnston Green,

700
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:39,150
sent from Jericho to wreak
havoc on this town.

701
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,250
Now we know,

702
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:43,950
if these people had their way,

703
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:46,350
New Bern would cease to exist.

704
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,050
With your help

705
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:50,650
and sacrifice,

706
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:54,650
I will make sure that
that never happens.
