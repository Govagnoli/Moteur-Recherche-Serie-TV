1
00:00:00,243 --> 00:00:01,590
<i>Previously on Jericho</i>

2
00:00:02,241 --> 00:00:03,542
Some of them were on planes

3
00:00:03,668 --> 00:00:05,228
that landed in
the middle of nowhere.

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,999
They've been walking for weeks.

5
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,080
They must have gone
through hell.

6
00:00:09,408 --> 00:00:12,100
Oh, my God.
Roger.

7
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:15,406
There's a woman in that
group of refugees that

8
00:00:15,407 --> 00:00:16,661
Bill is processing.

9
00:00:16,662 --> 00:00:17,925
I think you should talk to her.

10
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:19,482
Hello, Rob.

11
00:00:19,483 --> 00:00:21,662
Someone on my team
sold us all out.

12
00:00:21,663 --> 00:00:24,875
You're smart enough to know that they
would say anything to get you to talk.

13
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,729
At current levels of consumption,

14
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,899
we will be completely
out of gas and diesel in two weeks.

15
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,334
We can live without
power for now,

16
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:36,055
but we won't see spring
if we don't eat.

17
00:00:36,056 --> 00:00:37,400
All right, look,
the further out you get,

18
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:38,599
the hairier the roads are,

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,064
and food being
as scarce as it is,

20
00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:41,625
there's bound to be
trouble out there.

21
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:43,072
Why are they following us?

22
00:00:43,194 --> 00:00:44,264
Stanley, hold on!

23
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:50,139
Jake!
It's Mom and Dad, honey!

24
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:51,605
You're going to be all right.

25
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:54,498
So, I'm being watched?

26
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,899
It's the Old Man.

27
00:00:56,177 --> 00:00:58,183
He's coming for us,
using us against each other.

28
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,749
If they kill me,
they will never find the package.

29
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:03,411
I have something
in my possession,

30
00:01:03,412 --> 00:01:05,187
and there's people
out there that want it.

31
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:08,200
And that puts you, me
and the kids in danger here.

32
00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:09,623
Then listen to me...

33
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,533
Sarah is not on our side.

34
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:14,099
I'm telling you, Robert,
she's not here to help us.

35
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:16,548
Hawkins is starting to put
the pieces together.

36
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:17,938
He needs to be eliminated.

37
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,311
- I know.
- Why are you stalling on this one?

38
00:01:25,578 --> 00:01:27,681
Because this one is different.

39
00:01:39,676 --> 00:01:42,002
You won't make it out of Kansas
with the fuel you've got,

40
00:01:42,003 --> 00:01:43,734
and you're not going to find
another drop out there.

41
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:47,352
The folks who left last week
are probably in Arizona by now.

42
00:01:47,418 --> 00:01:49,149
If they weren't
murdered on the highway.

43
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,052
It is suicide to leave, Ridley.

44
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:53,985
There's no food, no heat.

45
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:56,084
It's suicide if we stay.

46
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:02,959
This... this is everything.

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,210
I mean, it's every farm.

48
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,041
At least until the spring crops come in,
and that could take months.

49
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:10,202
And what if we don't
factor in the refugees?

50
00:02:10,203 --> 00:02:11,763
They're a part of this town now.

51
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:13,400
A lot of extra mouths to feed.

52
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:14,713
They've done their part, Gray.

53
00:02:14,852 --> 00:02:16,365
They've helped hunt,
cut firewood...

54
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:19,533
Resources they use up five times
faster than they supply them.

55
00:02:19,534 --> 00:02:21,014
When the windmills come in
from New Bern,

56
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,468
most of our fuel issues
will be solved.

57
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:24,028
What about every day until then?

58
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:26,593
Ridley and his group
are about to leave.

59
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:29,419
If people want to try and make it
on their own, that's their right.

60
00:02:29,437 --> 00:02:31,317
You know as well as I do that
come springtime,

61
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,866
we'll find their bodies out there.

62
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,772
Well, what do you want me to do,
Johnston?

63
00:02:34,773 --> 00:02:36,665
Wh-What am I missing
that's not on that board?

64
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,402
You find it for me,
'cause I don't see it.

65
00:02:38,403 --> 00:02:41,469
Without some "X" factor,

66
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,352
we're not going to make it
through the winter.

67
00:02:43,353 --> 00:02:44,711
Not all of us.

68
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:49,727
We have to make
some hard decisions.

69
00:02:52,641 --> 00:02:55,785
And I think the last ones in
should be the first ones to go.

70
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:14,287
Clear the streets!

71
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,586
We need to clear the streets!

72
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:12,600
Who's in charge here?

73
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:16,350
I'm Gray Anderson.

74
00:04:16,581 --> 00:04:18,009
I'm the mayor of Jericho.

75
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:20,275
Glad to meet you,
Mayor Anderson.

76
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,194
I'm Gunnery Sergeant Hill.
Fourth MAR-DIV,

77
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:24,162
Fourth Tank Battalion,
Charlie Company.

78
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,590
So you're...?

79
00:04:25,783 --> 00:04:26,810
Sir,

80
00:04:27,288 --> 00:04:30,027
we're the United States Marines,
and we're here to help.

85
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,246
They sent the marines?

86
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:54,081
We were deployed to Western Kansas
to set up a firm base

87
00:04:54,716 --> 00:04:58,272
and prep the outlying towns for the
arrival of the Army Corps of Engineers.

88
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,487
Now that we've won the war,
it's time to start rebuilding.

89
00:05:01,578 --> 00:05:02,801
War? What war?

90
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:06,979
- You didn't hear?
- No.

91
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,405
We lost all communications
after the EMP.

92
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:12,769
Well, we nuked the hell
out of North Korea and Iran.

93
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:16,310
So they were behind it?

94
00:05:16,514 --> 00:05:18,822
From what I hear, which isn't much,
Iran financed it,

95
00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:20,759
North Korea supplied the bombs.

96
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:23,149
We've got troops all over the world
going after the...

97
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,788
terrorists who snuck them in,

98
00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:26,702
but at least we took
out the big dogs.

99
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:28,002
What happens now?

100
00:05:28,265 --> 00:05:30,705
Largest reconstruction effort
in the history of the country.

101
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,729
So there's somebody
finally in charge?

102
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:34,925
The former secretary of HHS
is now the president.

103
00:05:34,926 --> 00:05:36,429
We heard there
were six guys

104
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,745
from six different capitals
claiming to be president.

105
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:39,841
Resolved.

106
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:42,234
The federal government
is reunifying in Columbus, Ohio.

107
00:05:42,246 --> 00:05:43,794
How did they
decide on Columbus?

108
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:45,242
All I know is, my orders are coming

109
00:05:45,243 --> 00:05:47,436
from the commanding officer
of the Fourth Battalion,

110
00:05:47,818 --> 00:05:49,319
and
those are to restore lights,

111
00:05:49,705 --> 00:05:53,046
power and infrastructure
to Kansas, one town at a time.

112
00:05:57,185 --> 00:05:59,612
W- Wait, wait.
When is that going to happen?

113
00:05:59,613 --> 00:06:02,895
Should have your shelves full of Oreos
and Hot Pockets by the end of the year.

114
00:06:05,854 --> 00:06:07,877
Welcome back to the grid, Jericho.

115
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,160
Thank God for
the US Marines.

116
00:06:20,717 --> 00:06:22,139
Hey! Hey! It's over.

117
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:29,205
There are kids out here.
Get a room.

118
00:06:33,837 --> 00:06:36,647
Come on. We should have been
on the road yesterday.

119
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,369
Well, I'm packed.

120
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:43,918
Hi. We're all fueled up.

121
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:46,287
How are we doing?

122
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,703
We'll be ready when we're ready.

123
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:54,675
I'll get the rest of my things
from downstairs.

124
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:59,369
How many more times
are we going to have to move?

125
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:01,912
- This should do it.
- Really?

126
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,594
You're going to stay in
one place from now on?

127
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:10,281
Sergeant Green. Marine Corps?

128
00:07:10,286 --> 00:07:12,031
Ah, hell, no.
Army Rangers.

129
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,396
Well, I'll try not to hold it
against you.

130
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:17,431
Listen, Gunny, how long
before the engineers get here?

131
00:07:17,613 --> 00:07:19,494
Could be two days,
could be two weeks.

132
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,863
In the meantime, why don't you get
a wish list of what you need,

133
00:07:21,864 --> 00:07:24,504
and I'll forward that on to Battalion
Headquarters in Dodge City,

134
00:07:24,505 --> 00:07:27,031
and we'll start to get y'all back on
your feet.  - Roger that.

135
00:07:27,742 --> 00:07:29,272
Just tell me how
I can be of service.

136
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,349
Going to need
a command post.

137
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:32,956
- Use the sheriff's office.
- Great.

138
00:07:33,396 --> 00:07:34,412
Excuse me.

139
00:07:35,895 --> 00:07:37,512
If you guys are going
to be here for a while,

140
00:07:37,513 --> 00:07:39,529
why don't I take your men
over to my tavern.

141
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:41,788
Thanks, ma'am,
my troops could use it.

142
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:43,688
Wymore!
Front and center!

143
00:07:43,788 --> 00:07:45,288
Move it, move it!

144
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:47,571
Muster up and follow
this young lady here.

145
00:07:47,572 --> 00:07:49,412
The liberty call is
sounded, but remember...

146
00:07:49,462 --> 00:07:51,312
conduct yourselves like marines.
- Aye Sir.

147
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,104
Don't you "sir" me, PFC.

148
00:07:53,237 --> 00:07:54,887
I work for a living.
Dismissed!

149
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,120
Aye, aye, Gunnery Sergeant.

150
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:01,541
Couple of months ago, I would have had
that kid doing push-ups till he puked,

151
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:03,124
but, uh, they've
been through a lot.

152
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:05,457
I understand.
Anything else we can do?

153
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:08,632
Well, Sergeant, uh...
one other thing.

154
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:10,166
Corporal Mullin!

155
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:13,574
Hi. Uh, I'm looking to scavenge
some replacement parts.

156
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:15,940
Our radio, well, it took
a couple of pretty good hits.

157
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:17,632
Do you have any idea
where I could start?

158
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:18,865
Maybe I could help.

159
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,224
Oh, Lance Corporal Mullin.

160
00:08:20,225 --> 00:08:21,640
- Jake.
- Maggie.

161
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:23,973
So you're the town's
electronics expert?

162
00:08:24,157 --> 00:08:25,707
No, I'm not an expert
at anything.

163
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,807
- But I can improvise.
- I'll take that.

164
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,640
We'll see what
we can find.

165
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:45,509
So, uh...

166
00:08:46,965 --> 00:08:48,015
I've been thinking...

167
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,242
Maybe leaving my family...

168
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:53,226
isn't such a good idea.

169
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:54,975
What?

170
00:08:55,992 --> 00:08:57,192
Why?
We've been over this.

171
00:08:57,225 --> 00:08:58,908
They-they're not safe
here with you.

172
00:08:58,958 --> 00:08:59,975
I know.

173
00:09:00,308 --> 00:09:02,041
There are people out there
who would...

174
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,758
hurt them in order to get to me.

175
00:09:05,032 --> 00:09:06,607
But at least I understand
the dangers.

176
00:09:06,608 --> 00:09:07,640
I can protect them.

177
00:09:07,869 --> 00:09:09,032
You're not thinking straight.

178
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:10,399
This is my family, Sarah.

179
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,283
It never mattered before.

180
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:14,049
Now it does.

181
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:17,749
What's it going to take...

182
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,174
someone slitting your wife's throat
before you get it ?

183
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:27,334
You're right.

184
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:32,309
We will drop them
at the safe house,

185
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:34,525
and then we'll keep moving.

186
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,325
It's the right thing for them.

187
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:04,792
I just realized...
Hmm?

188
00:10:05,425 --> 00:10:07,433
If the government
is up and running,

189
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,633
you know what that means, right?
- No

190
00:10:09,774 --> 00:10:10,774
Paperwork.

191
00:10:11,308 --> 00:10:12,724
They'll need
accountants again.

192
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:14,058
Does that mean I'm back in debt?

193
00:10:14,074 --> 00:10:16,258
Don't be so negative.
New York made it.

194
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,349
Come next summer,

195
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,663
I'll be taking walks
though Central Park.

196
00:10:21,363 --> 00:10:22,371
What?

197
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,496
Dude!
This is awesome!

198
00:10:24,497 --> 00:10:26,420
I could totally
be a marine.

199
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,898
I could totally see that happening...

200
00:10:29,114 --> 00:10:30,914
Except for everything about you.

201
00:10:39,617 --> 00:10:40,617
God, I...

202
00:10:40,642 --> 00:10:41,875
Don't worry about her.

203
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,692
It's a phase, trust me.

204
00:10:44,242 --> 00:10:46,108
The minute everything
calms down,

205
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:47,258
he's as good as gone.

206
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,982
Yeah, yeah, maybe
you can give him a ride

207
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:50,508
out of town
on the way to New York.

208
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:54,175
Thinking about leaving
this town is not

209
00:10:54,176 --> 00:10:56,775
the same thing as thinking
about leaving you.

210
00:10:56,776 --> 00:10:57,792
No?

211
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:01,383
Well, it adds up to
the same thing, Mimi.

212
00:11:03,345 --> 00:11:05,010
Maybe you could
come with me.

213
00:11:06,793 --> 00:11:09,126
Yeah, I'm-I'm sorry.
That's not my life.

214
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,860
Well, this isn't mine.

215
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,763
I've missed you.

216
00:11:31,446 --> 00:11:32,446
Me, too.

217
00:11:36,492 --> 00:11:37,609
We should get going.

218
00:11:40,778 --> 00:11:42,644
Start loading up
the truck, huh?

219
00:11:46,028 --> 00:11:47,278
Go on, get out of here.

220
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,142
I heard what happened.
Are you okay?

221
00:12:25,192 --> 00:12:26,825
Yeah, I'm better than the truck.

222
00:12:27,475 --> 00:12:30,475
Be able to quit worrying about you
one of these days, right?

223
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,616
Hey, Jake.
Amazing, huh?

224
00:12:33,995 --> 00:12:35,245
Yeah, it's great news.

225
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:37,778
I'll see you later.

226
00:12:41,229 --> 00:12:43,263
How are most of
the towns out there?

227
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:45,492
Let's just say
I haven't seen

228
00:12:45,493 --> 00:12:47,542
anything like this
since we entered the CZ.

229
00:12:47,742 --> 00:12:48,759
"CZ"?

230
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:50,325
Contamination Zone.

231
00:12:50,326 --> 00:12:51,663
You're in CZ-12,

232
00:12:51,913 --> 00:12:53,554
and you're better
off than most.

233
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:54,779
That's hard to imagine.

234
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:57,304
Try taking a walk through what's
left of Lawrence, Kansas.

235
00:12:57,421 --> 00:12:58,429
What's it like?

236
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:00,406
Buildings
are all gone.

237
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:02,623
People who are left are
fighting their neighbors

238
00:13:02,624 --> 00:13:03,706
for food and water.

239
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:07,779
Makes you wonder if the
survivors are the lucky ones.

240
00:13:13,795 --> 00:13:16,401
We need a transistor
for their radio.

241
00:13:16,468 --> 00:13:17,985
Can we take
apart the jukebox?

242
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:19,935
Oh, you're going to take
my music?

243
00:13:20,368 --> 00:13:22,301
Isn't there anything else
you can take apart?

244
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:24,942
You've got three
Spin Doctors albums on here.

245
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,087
Trust me, it's a public service.

246
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:30,458
Don't worry, there's an old
ham radio in City Hall.

247
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:32,074
Maybe we can take that apart.

248
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:33,932
- Thanks anyway.
- Bye.

249
00:13:36,893 --> 00:13:37,893
Oh, hey, big guy.

250
00:13:39,376 --> 00:13:41,076
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

251
00:14:29,843 --> 00:14:31,867
I think you have something
of mine.

252
00:14:38,938 --> 00:14:41,299
Sweetie,
let's sit down on the couch.

253
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:43,373
Your dad and I have
some talking to do.

254
00:14:43,695 --> 00:14:44,827
You go ahead, Sam.

255
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,212
Just play with
your coloring books.

256
00:15:23,982 --> 00:15:25,410
This is what you want, right?

257
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,166
Among other things.

258
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:33,146
You been lying to me, Robert.

259
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:36,272
When did you fall back
in love with your wife?

260
00:15:39,976 --> 00:15:40,979
It's okay.

261
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:42,967
You go back to your book.
Go ahead.

262
00:15:49,006 --> 00:15:52,093
We tried to institute
rationing early on,

263
00:15:52,094 --> 00:15:54,215
but it took some time
for people to accept

264
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:55,603
that we were really
on our own.

265
00:15:56,549 --> 00:15:59,221
Looks like you did a better job
than most towns I've seen.

266
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:01,391
Town's lucky to have
a military man in charge.

267
00:16:01,681 --> 00:16:03,184
Well, I guess we
made out all right.

268
00:16:03,185 --> 00:16:04,653
With salt from my mine,

269
00:16:04,654 --> 00:16:06,973
we've been able to do
some trading with nearby towns.

270
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,036
Your town seems
to have been blessed.

271
00:16:09,974 --> 00:16:11,196
That said, uh...

272
00:16:11,353 --> 00:16:13,199
I can't say you'll be
a priority on the list.

273
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,570
Um, uh...
Wait a minute... what list?

274
00:16:15,571 --> 00:16:18,816
We got detachments all over Kansas
assessing each town's needs.

275
00:16:18,817 --> 00:16:21,745
Relief is given
on an as needed basis.

276
00:16:21,746 --> 00:16:23,458
Wait a second.
You're saying that because

277
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,919
we planned better than others
it will come against us?

278
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,490
We can make out for
a while longer if we have to.

279
00:16:28,491 --> 00:16:31,303
That's easy for you to say.
You're not being held accountable.

280
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:33,483
Why don't you give me
that want list and, uh,

281
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:34,948
I'll see what I can do.

282
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:45,047
Try that one.

283
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,182
Perfect.

284
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,327
So you're really not going
to tell me what happened?

285
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:55,753
Doc says frostbite.

286
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,508
Doctor also say
who kicked your ass?

287
00:17:02,474 --> 00:17:04,334
Someone ran us off the road.

288
00:17:05,062 --> 00:17:07,299
Most of it's a blur.
Just, uh,

289
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:09,814
tried to stay alive, you know?

290
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,034
I do.

291
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:18,332
- So, the marines, huh?
- Yeah.

292
00:17:18,612 --> 00:17:20,340
Is it everything you hoped for?

293
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:22,695
There are moments.

294
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,949
But when I signed up, I never
thought I'd be fighting Americans.

295
00:17:27,895 --> 00:17:29,944
Good people forced
to do bad things.

296
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:31,953
That's got to be rough.
I'm sorry.

297
00:17:31,986 --> 00:17:33,285
It's not your problem.

298
00:17:39,218 --> 00:17:40,343
What?

299
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:43,824
Just, uh,

300
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:47,360
wondering why someone like you
would join the marines.

301
00:17:47,427 --> 00:17:48,873
Someone like me?

302
00:17:50,601 --> 00:17:52,785
I had an office job
until a few years ago,

303
00:17:52,786 --> 00:17:53,815
but I got bored.

304
00:17:54,297 --> 00:17:55,703
I wanted to see the world.

305
00:17:55,704 --> 00:17:57,600
- Have you?
- I've seen Omaha.

306
00:17:58,101 --> 00:18:00,749
- You?
- What, seen the world? Yeah.

307
00:18:03,037 --> 00:18:05,032
Yeah, I just saw
all the wrong places.

308
00:18:06,847 --> 00:18:07,854
Man,

309
00:18:08,347 --> 00:18:11,797
you have this brooding,
bad-boy thing down to an art.

310
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,003
The video I was sent
before the attacks,

311
00:18:23,485 --> 00:18:25,499
those people were not
holding you captive.

312
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:27,127
You were just...

313
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:28,830
what, you were playing me?

314
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:30,384
Me playing you?

315
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:33,858
We were living together.

316
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,771
I showed up here
and you have a family again.

317
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:39,975
It's okay.
It's just a...

318
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,746
a story, you know?
It's just a story we're telling.

319
00:18:43,886 --> 00:18:45,118
Go back to your book.

320
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,100
You made me promises, Robert.

321
00:18:47,704 --> 00:18:49,386
Who were the people in that video?

322
00:18:49,493 --> 00:18:50,939
Is that who you're working for?

323
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,478
I was. Now,
I'm working for myself.

324
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,759
So why don't you
give me what I want,

325
00:18:56,974 --> 00:18:59,063
and then this story
can have a happy ending.

326
00:19:04,874 --> 00:19:06,963
What are you gonna do
in the Marines finally...

327
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:09,299
- cut you loose?
- I try not to think about it.

328
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,515
That means you have.

329
00:19:11,729 --> 00:19:13,422
After everything I've seen...

330
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:16,437
I'd like to find a nice little town

331
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:18,452
and just settle in
for the duration.

332
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,594
I don't think those
exist anymore.

333
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:22,527
I just found out they do.

334
00:19:25,736 --> 00:19:26,754
What about you?

335
00:19:26,786 --> 00:19:28,412
You ever thought
about flying again?

336
00:19:28,703 --> 00:19:29,796
Maybe for the military?

337
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:31,971
Sure. Safer than being
on the ground, right?

338
00:19:32,016 --> 00:19:33,795
Not if you're a radio operator.

339
00:19:34,045 --> 00:19:36,155
I'm the safest of all.
I get to ride in the tank.

340
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,698
But if you ride in the tank,
how'd the radio get shot?

341
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:40,353
What, you think a girl can't...

342
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:42,850
get out and kick some ass
every once in a while?

343
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:47,338
Who you trying to call
on that thing anyway?

344
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:49,410
Uh, division headquarters
in Dodge City.

345
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:50,588
That's about 200 miles away.

346
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:51,948
This thing's made it farther.

347
00:19:52,012 --> 00:19:54,315
Of course, that was
before it took some rounds.

348
00:19:57,395 --> 00:19:58,884
Fourth MAR-DIV.
Fourth MAR-DIV,

349
00:19:58,885 --> 00:20:01,899
this is First Platoon, Charlie Company.
Authentication "thunder." Over.

350
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:07,031
Fourth MAR-DIV.
Fourth MAR-DIV.

351
00:20:07,032 --> 00:20:10,096
This is First Platoon, Charlie Company.
Authentication "thunder." Over.

352
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:13,717
<i>Lima Charlie Thunder.
This is Charlie Company Actual.</i>

353
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,493
<I>We've been trying to raise you
on this frequency for days.

354
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,718
<I>Division needs the entire
fourth tank battalion RTB ASAP.

355
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:22,198
<I>Do you copy?

356
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:24,719
Aye, aye, sir.

357
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,670
<I>Make that most tricky-tick, Corporal.

358
00:20:27,401 --> 00:20:29,394
Roger that,
Charlie Company Actual, out.

359
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:36,315
What's going on?

360
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:39,518
We just got ordered
back to Dodge City.

361
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:44,768
What are you going to do
with the package, Sarah?

362
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,375
Sell it.

363
00:20:47,194 --> 00:20:49,241
And get as far away
from here as possible.

364
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,242
What happened to you?

365
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:04,742
The last few months,

366
00:21:05,236 --> 00:21:06,853
I've learned two things.

367
00:21:07,261 --> 00:21:09,028
Everybody has a price.

368
00:21:10,164 --> 00:21:11,803
And everybody lies.

369
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:17,342
Sit still, Sam.

370
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:18,681
- Take your...
- Stay there

371
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,187
I was just having a conversation
with your husband...

372
00:21:21,851 --> 00:21:23,576
about what's more
important to him...

373
00:21:23,637 --> 00:21:24,654
His job...

374
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,807
or his family.

375
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,241
Why are you leaving ?

376
00:21:41,251 --> 00:21:42,617
Because we were
ordered to.

377
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,749
Sorry, but I can't reveal
operational orders.

378
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,000
Army Corps of Engineers
will be through eventually.

379
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:48,417
Eventually?
How long?

380
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,117
Sir, listen, I'm sorry,
but I just don't know.

381
00:21:52,582 --> 00:21:54,249
You ready to roll?
Good to go, Gunny.

382
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:55,516
But I don't know
about the tank.

383
00:21:55,517 --> 00:21:57,799
Don't know if we have enough fuel
to make it back to Dodge City.

384
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,900
Leave it behind
if we have to.

385
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,050
We'll post Sigloch and Kent here
till we can make it back.

386
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:03,324
Sergeant, without armor we're
sitting ducks for those highwaymen.

387
00:22:03,325 --> 00:22:05,167
We're marines. We'll make do.

388
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,984
I can get you fuel.

389
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,566
Not much, but enough
to get you back to Dodge.

390
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,000
Just give me an hour.

391
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:14,284
I'm listening.

392
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,750
Plus... whatever
supplies you need.

393
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,600
But I just need assurances that
Jericho will be taken care of.

394
00:22:24,467 --> 00:22:26,567
There's three C-130s
full of Red Cross supplies

395
00:22:26,568 --> 00:22:28,667
that are supposed to arrive
in Kansas in 12 days.

396
00:22:28,684 --> 00:22:31,167
I guarantee you'll be
at the top of their list.

397
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:32,516
That's all I ask.

398
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:34,166
All right, people,
listen up!

399
00:22:34,317 --> 00:22:36,017
We're going to stand
down for one hour.

400
00:22:36,734 --> 00:22:41,067
When the relief effort comes,
are you guys coming with it?

401
00:22:41,466 --> 00:22:42,516
No.

402
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:45,816
You're going have to flirt with
a whole new batch of grunts.

403
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:47,249
And the Corps of Engineers

404
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,943
are nowhere near
as cute as I am.

405
00:22:51,234 --> 00:22:52,584
You should think about...

406
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,334
coming back when you get out.

407
00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:58,184
What would I do here?

408
00:23:00,784 --> 00:23:03,384
That's a question we're all
asking ourselves, but...

409
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:05,528
you're a good fit.

410
00:23:08,378 --> 00:23:10,311
You know,
before all this started,

411
00:23:11,802 --> 00:23:13,435
I might have agreed with you.

412
00:23:13,535 --> 00:23:14,552
But, uh...

413
00:23:17,452 --> 00:23:18,902
I won't make it back here.

414
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:40,034
Corporal Mullin!

415
00:23:41,034 --> 00:23:42,417
Yes, Gunnery Sergeant.

416
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:44,084
Why is your gear
not loaded up?

417
00:23:44,634 --> 00:23:45,967
- Uh...
- Don't answer that.

418
00:23:46,566 --> 00:23:48,015
We're headed over
to the town hall.

419
00:23:48,016 --> 00:23:49,667
The mayor wants
to express his appreciation.

420
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:51,224
Somebody needs to stay here.
You...

421
00:23:51,225 --> 00:23:52,774
Youjust drew
the short straw.

422
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:54,958
Aye, Gunny.

423
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,265
I'm going to go get

424
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:01,987
the last of the supplies
from the sheriff's office.

425
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,759
Get the package.

426
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:10,942
You know I can't do that.

427
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,409
You think I'm going
to believe a word you say?

428
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,384
Come on. We can work this out.

429
00:24:15,942 --> 00:24:17,859
You had your chance
to go with me.

430
00:24:17,942 --> 00:24:19,109
Please!
Shut up!

431
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:23,650
You're losing something tonight.
I promise you that.

432
00:24:24,894 --> 00:24:25,895
Only question is,

433
00:24:25,896 --> 00:24:28,029
is it going to be something
with a heartbeat?

434
00:24:37,412 --> 00:24:38,578
I'll get the package.

435
00:24:38,995 --> 00:24:41,595
Please put that gun down.

436
00:24:43,178 --> 00:24:45,428
Why don't you get
Allison down here, too?

437
00:24:53,211 --> 00:24:55,794
<i>Lima Charlie Thunder.
This is Charlie Company Actual.</i>

438
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:56,811
Do you copy?

439
00:24:57,511 --> 00:24:59,378
Lima Charlie,
it's cold as hell out here.

440
00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:01,628
Hello?
This is Jake Green.

441
00:25:01,694 --> 00:25:03,869
Jake Green, this is an official
Marine channel.

442
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,428
Get off this...

443
00:25:08,761 --> 00:25:09,778
Hello?

444
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,660
Hello. Are you taking fire?

445
00:25:46,715 --> 00:25:47,723
Hey, Gunny!

446
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:51,930
It's just a little something
to remember us by.

447
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,913
This is too kind, Mr. Mayor,

448
00:25:53,914 --> 00:25:54,945
but, uh, we really
should press on.

449
00:25:54,946 --> 00:25:57,362
No, you can't take off
on an empty stomach.

450
00:25:58,671 --> 00:26:00,638
Come on in, I got
a little surprise for you.

451
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:03,221
Just something to show our
gratitude. Come on.

452
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,055
I need you to grab some of
our guys from patrol

453
00:26:15,056 --> 00:26:17,171
and do a sweep of the
area, all right? Take guns.

454
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,088
Are you kidding?

455
00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:20,567
I mean, we got
the US Marines Corps here.

456
00:26:20,568 --> 00:26:23,050
Something's wrong about all this.
Trust me.

457
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,672
Okay, okay. Well...
what am I looking for?

458
00:26:26,122 --> 00:26:27,722
A guy with a radio for starters.

459
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:29,916
Check anywhere within
earshot of the fireworks.

460
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,166
All right, maybe it's
nothing. Just check.

461
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:33,299
- All right? Go!
- Okay.

462
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:34,431
I can't talk.

463
00:26:35,546 --> 00:26:37,313
What?
It's good talking to you.

464
00:26:47,216 --> 00:26:49,149
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen.

465
00:26:49,461 --> 00:26:51,144
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

466
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:54,011
Honored guests.

467
00:26:55,544 --> 00:26:58,677
I was very hopeful
that former Sergeant Green

468
00:26:58,844 --> 00:27:00,460
might like to
say a few words.

469
00:27:10,661 --> 00:27:12,394
Ladies and gentlemen, um...

470
00:27:12,744 --> 00:27:16,744
Marine Corps has a motto
"Semper fidelis"

471
00:27:17,128 --> 00:27:18,161
Always faithful.

472
00:27:19,344 --> 00:27:21,928
And I think it's very fitting
that in our darkest hour,

473
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:24,494
it was marines who came
to our rescue.

474
00:27:25,528 --> 00:27:27,228
Never before
in our nation's history

475
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,511
has a motto been so tried...

476
00:27:31,244 --> 00:27:32,811
...and so necessary.

477
00:27:34,761 --> 00:27:37,294
Gunny, Marines,

478
00:27:38,228 --> 00:27:39,244
semper fi.

479
00:27:58,194 --> 00:27:59,894
So, Gunny,
the Fighting Fourth.

480
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:01,494
Seen more than
your share of action.

481
00:28:01,495 --> 00:28:04,644
From Iwo to Iraq, if there's a war,
there's the fourth.

482
00:28:04,645 --> 00:28:05,661
Semper fi.

483
00:28:11,728 --> 00:28:13,011
Excuse us a second.

484
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,936
What is the matter?
What's going on?

485
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:25,419
Downstairs.

486
00:28:36,639 --> 00:28:37,839
I just, uh...

487
00:28:38,223 --> 00:28:40,256
I heard the fireworks
over the marines' radio,

488
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,456
and Dodge City
is 200 miles away.

489
00:28:42,457 --> 00:28:44,573
- What?  - They've got somebody
on the edge of town

490
00:28:44,574 --> 00:28:46,390
pretending
to be their headquarters.

491
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,978
I sent Stanley and a couple of
the guys to check it out.

492
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:50,428
Tell me I'm crazy.

493
00:28:51,178 --> 00:28:52,728
If you are, so am I.

494
00:28:53,946 --> 00:28:56,046
Nobody calls an NCO "sir,"

495
00:28:56,047 --> 00:28:58,096
and a marine
would never say, "Hoo-ah."

496
00:28:58,097 --> 00:28:59,296
That's an Army thing.

497
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,179
These guys
did both.

498
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,812
Marines are all
about detail.

499
00:29:03,295 --> 00:29:05,495
Well, if they're not marines,
who are they?

500
00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:08,628
People with enough firepower
to wipe us out.

501
00:29:08,794 --> 00:29:11,119
And we gave them half
the town's supplies.

502
00:29:14,969 --> 00:29:16,385
What do we do?

503
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,960
Well, we've got to tell Gray.

504
00:29:17,961 --> 00:29:20,260
How do we get Gray alone?
He's right next to them.

505
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,627
We got to do something
about that tank.

506
00:29:21,628 --> 00:29:23,536
That thing gets turned lose
on Main Street,

507
00:29:23,537 --> 00:29:24,553
it'll be a
bloodbath.

508
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,670
Even if you get that tank, they'll still
have a room full of hostages.

509
00:29:32,131 --> 00:29:33,281
She's right.

510
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:35,498
We better get back before
they start to wonder.

511
00:29:35,598 --> 00:29:38,454
Try to get a message to Gray,
and I'll wait for Stanley.

512
00:29:38,521 --> 00:29:40,454
I'll see what I can do
about the tank.

513
00:30:33,217 --> 00:30:34,233
Hey.

514
00:30:39,383 --> 00:30:41,783
How was Dodge City picking up
our fireworks?

515
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,533
We pick up pops and pings
all the time...

516
00:30:45,534 --> 00:30:46,550
Don't lie to me!

517
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:49,233
<i>Hello? Anyone out there?</i>

518
00:30:53,266 --> 00:30:55,216
Stanley, is that you?

519
00:30:55,425 --> 00:30:57,067
Jake, we found this guy
camping out here

520
00:30:57,068 --> 00:30:58,875
with this radio.
Says he's with the marines.

521
00:30:58,876 --> 00:31:00,200
I'm going to bring him back.

522
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,001
Is any of this real?

523
00:31:03,002 --> 00:31:04,485
The gun's real.

524
00:31:07,051 --> 00:31:08,060
I'm sorry.

525
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:10,334
You con people out
of stale food

526
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:11,984
and enough fuel to get
to the next town?

527
00:31:11,985 --> 00:31:13,686
You don't know how bad
it is out there.

528
00:31:13,687 --> 00:31:14,769
Yeah, I do.

529
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:18,969
Where'd you get all this?

530
00:31:20,017 --> 00:31:23,150
There was a food riot
in our refugee camp.

531
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,100
A dozen marines
never had a chance

532
00:31:27,101 --> 00:31:28,733
against 10,000 starving people.

533
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,000
So you killed them?

534
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,017
They retreated
and we took what they left.

535
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:36,367
Tried to get some food
in the next town.

536
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:38,833
It worked so well,
we kept doing it.

537
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:40,065
Don't.

538
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:42,116
You're not leaving town
with those supplies.

539
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:45,223
Don't get yourself killed
doing something stupid, Jake.

540
00:31:45,873 --> 00:31:47,656
I don't want that
on my conscience.

541
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:52,198
You don't have it in you.

542
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:13,840
Open it.

543
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:31,083
Step... back.

544
00:32:36,924 --> 00:32:37,931
My God.

545
00:32:37,932 --> 00:32:40,457
- This has been here the whole time?
- It is not armed,

546
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,106
and the lead blocks
all the radiation...

547
00:32:42,107 --> 00:32:44,204
- You brought that into our house?!
- D...

548
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:53,465
We were almost out of here,
and you told him, Maggie?

549
00:32:53,466 --> 00:32:54,665
He figured it out.

550
00:32:55,032 --> 00:32:56,765
He heard the fireworks
on the radio.

551
00:32:56,932 --> 00:32:58,798
- So what do we do with him now?
- What do you mean?

552
00:32:58,799 --> 00:32:59,915
Let's just leave.

553
00:33:00,048 --> 00:33:01,058
And what...

554
00:33:01,757 --> 00:33:04,324
wait for him to tell the whole town
when we're half a mile out?

555
00:33:04,402 --> 00:33:06,118
It'll be Greenville
all over again.

556
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:07,384
We're not killers.

557
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:09,851
I was a P. E. teacher
who saw too many movies.

558
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:11,443
Now I'm a marine.

559
00:33:11,493 --> 00:33:12,493
I'm adapting.

560
00:33:12,526 --> 00:33:14,976
- No.
- It's him or us.

561
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:16,433
I vote for you.

562
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:23,517
You know, ammunition
being in such short supply,

563
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:25,233
I doubt those weapons
are even loaded.

564
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:26,834
You want to take that chance?

565
00:33:27,234 --> 00:33:28,934
I know damn well this one is.

566
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,084
Son of a... bitch!

567
00:33:33,725 --> 00:33:35,350
Get your hands up!
Get them up!

568
00:33:39,555 --> 00:33:40,572
Get up.

569
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:43,055
How dare you wear
that uniform!

570
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:45,272
It's not a uniform...
it's a costume.

571
00:33:45,372 --> 00:33:47,539
Half the towns we go through
don't even fly the flag.

572
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,103
Wait. Everything you said
about the war, North Korea,

573
00:33:50,104 --> 00:33:51,113
it was all a lie?

574
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:52,929
Some of it we heard,
some we made up.

575
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:54,929
It's anybody's guess what's really
going on out there.

576
00:33:54,954 --> 00:33:56,454
Well, we still have laws
in Jericho,

577
00:33:56,455 --> 00:33:59,260
and tomorrow I'm going to let the town
decide what to do with you.

578
00:33:59,727 --> 00:34:00,860
We can't do that, Gray.

579
00:34:00,926 --> 00:34:02,110
The hell we can't!

580
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:04,026
People need to know
what we're up against.

581
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:05,051
Not like this.

582
00:34:05,052 --> 00:34:06,376
Well, they're going to find out
eventually.

583
00:34:06,426 --> 00:34:07,493
Yeah, they will.

584
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,659
And by then, the worst
of it will be over.

585
00:34:09,742 --> 00:34:11,226
But food's not enough.

586
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:12,784
You said it yourself.

587
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:14,642
Without some "X" factor,

588
00:34:14,643 --> 00:34:16,988
we don't make it through the winter.
Well, this is it.

589
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:19,852
People need faith
just as much as they need food.

590
00:34:20,252 --> 00:34:22,135
And what the hell
do we do with them?

591
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,410
Then we give a hero's exit.

592
00:34:33,143 --> 00:34:34,177
Ooh-rah.

593
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,677
How can I be sure
you won't follow me?

594
00:34:36,776 --> 00:34:37,810
I won't follow you.

595
00:34:38,793 --> 00:34:41,163
Not if I take your son with me,
you won't.

596
00:34:41,487 --> 00:34:42,296
My God.

597
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:44,381
I'll leave him
just outside of town.

598
00:34:45,148 --> 00:34:46,148
No!

599
00:34:53,334 --> 00:34:55,656
- Dad!
- Allie, get them out of here!

600
00:35:58,027 --> 00:35:59,956
- You okay?
- I'm fine, Dad.

601
00:36:00,185 --> 00:36:01,927
- I'm sorry.
- Dad...

602
00:36:01,928 --> 00:36:03,557
I'm fine.

603
00:36:11,262 --> 00:36:12,481
Let me take this.

604
00:36:19,446 --> 00:36:21,240
You are not fine.

605
00:36:22,755 --> 00:36:24,603
Robert, we are not fine!

606
00:36:25,714 --> 00:36:27,763
How long till-till
more people come after you?

607
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,257
Huh, after us?

608
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,422
- Come on, D, we're safe here.
- Don't...!

609
00:36:35,191 --> 00:36:36,623
We'll never be safe with you.

610
00:36:36,877 --> 00:36:38,083
Come on.

611
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:44,939
Let's go.

612
00:36:47,697 --> 00:36:48,822
Let's go.

613
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:53,309
I love you, Dad.

614
00:36:56,309 --> 00:36:57,782
I love you, too, baby girl.

615
00:37:08,336 --> 00:37:10,023
Move out! Let's go!

616
00:37:35,644 --> 00:37:37,545
Our own personal escort
out of town?

617
00:37:38,777 --> 00:37:40,050
Look, you're a smart girl,

618
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:42,406
you need to get out
before these guys get you killed.

619
00:37:42,407 --> 00:37:43,411
And go where?

620
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:45,800
Towns aren't taking refugees,

621
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:47,876
and there's only one thing
they want women for.

622
00:37:47,877 --> 00:37:50,018
Stay here... all right,
you'll be safe.

623
00:37:50,232 --> 00:37:52,821
It's not going to work.
Not after the story we told.

624
00:38:04,526 --> 00:38:05,531
Not now, Mimi.

625
00:38:05,532 --> 00:38:07,579
Like hell not now, Cornhusker.

626
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:10,278
Cornhuskers are from Nebraska.
I'm a Jayhawk.

627
00:38:13,393 --> 00:38:14,478
What? What?

628
00:38:15,148 --> 00:38:17,183
You drive me so crazy,

629
00:38:17,384 --> 00:38:19,822
and you know that
I can't stay here forever, but...

630
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:22,326
the truth is...

631
00:38:22,702 --> 00:38:24,911
I can't live without you, either.

632
00:38:30,576 --> 00:38:31,594
Really?

633
00:38:31,915 --> 00:38:33,442
Yes, really.

634
00:40:08,983 --> 00:40:11,675
We got enough food to get all of you
a few days down the road.

635
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,648
Hey, how about some water, man?

636
00:40:17,573 --> 00:40:19,006
Make do.

637
00:40:20,412 --> 00:40:22,528
You'll leave your weapons
on the tank,

638
00:40:22,742 --> 00:40:24,256
and you will move out.

639
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,024
Do it.

640
00:40:41,651 --> 00:40:42,698
Come on.

641
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,102
Let's go.

642
00:40:56,063 --> 00:40:57,101
Be careful.

643
00:41:08,152 --> 00:41:09,457
What do we do?

644
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:13,308
We soldier on.

645
00:41:15,536 --> 00:41:16,892
What do we do with that?

646
00:41:24,292 --> 00:41:25,715
Got room in your barn?

647
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:27,473
Seriously?

648
00:41:27,942 --> 00:41:29,097
Why not.

649
00:41:30,201 --> 00:41:32,177
Never know when
you might need a tank.

650
00:41:42,279 --> 00:41:47,479
