1
00:00:00,222 --> 00:00:01,628
<i>Previously on Jericho.</i>

2
00:00:01,765 --> 00:00:03,775
So I hear you and I
are going to be partners now.

3
00:00:03,776 --> 00:00:04,818
Where'd you get that?

4
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:07,190
You're running the store,
you're going to need protection.

5
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,560
Don't make the same mistake
that Gracie made.

6
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:12,561
Or those people out there
are going to be putting

7
00:00:12,562 --> 00:00:14,364
flowers and candles
on the sidewalk for you.

8
00:00:16,144 --> 00:00:17,166
Who the hell is that?

9
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:25,834
Remember,
the gas tank on this thing

10
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:27,075
is on the left-hand side,

11
00:00:27,076 --> 00:00:29,047
so if somebody decides
to start shooting at you,

12
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:30,405
make sure it's not on that side.

13
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:31,590
Okay. Anything else?

14
00:00:37,283 --> 00:00:39,853
So, are we going to see you
for Thanksgiving?

15
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:42,657
Well, I think Mary and I
are going to spend it together.

16
00:00:42,658 --> 00:00:43,885
Well, you're always welcome.

17
00:00:43,886 --> 00:00:46,501
Thanks, but I don't want to put
you guys in an awkward position.

18
00:00:46,502 --> 00:00:49,311
You could have thought of that before
you moved in with your mistress

19
00:00:49,312 --> 00:00:50,642
and left your wife with us.

20
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,339
Some of them were on planes

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,842
that landed in the middle of nowhere.

22
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:56,796
They've been walking for weeks.

23
00:00:57,326 --> 00:00:58,868
They must have gone through hell.

24
00:00:59,113 --> 00:01:00,149
Oh, my God.

25
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:06,243
Is it really you?

26
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,105
I need you to keep the kids
in the house for a while

27
00:01:09,106 --> 00:01:10,399
until I can sort something out.

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,697
Are we in danger, Robert?

29
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,534
You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.

30
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:17,284
You need to keep them
clean and warm.

31
00:01:18,213 --> 00:01:19,459
Do you have a place to stay?

32
00:01:20,774 --> 00:01:22,306
Do you know anyone in Jericho?

33
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:26,161
Actually,

34
00:01:26,893 --> 00:01:27,897
I do.

35
00:01:38,103 --> 00:01:39,531
It's freezing in here, too.

36
00:01:40,187 --> 00:01:41,190
Mr. Bintner?

37
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:46,804
Mr. Bintner?

38
00:01:52,089 --> 00:01:53,189
Joe?

39
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:20,391
The temperature dropped so fast.

40
00:02:24,326 --> 00:02:26,274
It's going to be a long winter.

41
00:02:26,303 --> 00:02:28,329
All right, everyone!
Everyone, please!

42
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:29,718
Please!

43
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,933
Right now,

44
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:33,267
we're using the generator
to power the town hall

45
00:02:33,268 --> 00:02:35,544
for three hours a day,
and the Med Center for six.

46
00:02:36,084 --> 00:02:38,727
And this is how much fuel we have,

47
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:41,081
and this is how much we need

48
00:02:41,082 --> 00:02:42,470
to get us through the winter.

49
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,978
At current levels of consumption,

50
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:47,833
we will be completely
out of gas and diesel

51
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,933
in two weeks.

52
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:51,354
I wonder when the dancing girls show up.

53
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:52,357
Stop.

54
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:55,782
There's a way of doing this without
scaring the crap out of everybody.

55
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:57,016
He was elected.

56
00:02:57,486 --> 00:02:58,895
Guess he's going to do it his way.

57
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:01,075
I'm going to need a hobby.

58
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:02,416
So here's what we're working on.

59
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:04,721
All right, we got
organized firewood crews...

60
00:03:04,846 --> 00:03:06,428
- Mr. Hawkins?
- Yeah.

61
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,454
There's a woman
in that group of refugees

62
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,750
that Bill is processing,
I think you should talk to her.

63
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:11,966
Why?

64
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:14,146
She said she used to be
a cop in Saint Louis.

65
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:18,371
Especially with 53
new people among us,

66
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,763
we have got to start rethinking things,

67
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,442
fast,

68
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:24,198
or the people we lost last night

69
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,455
won't be the only casualties
of this coming winter.

70
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,970
What about the windmills?

71
00:03:28,086 --> 00:03:29,089
She's right.

72
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:31,095
Wind power.

73
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:33,372
We should be building windmills.

74
00:03:33,373 --> 00:03:34,385
Harry?

75
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:36,581
I think you all know Harry Carmichael,

76
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:38,317
our chief engineer
down at the mine.

77
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,175
We've been looking into wind turbines
for weeks now with Mayor Green.

78
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:43,818
But in order to build anything
that can be connected to the grid,

79
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:45,284
it's going to take time.

80
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:47,590
Time I'm not sure we can afford.

81
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,895
- She's in here.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

82
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:03,351
Hello, Rob.

83
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:07,461
Any parts we don't have...

84
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:09,815
we simply don't have
the maching capabilities.

85
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,397
What kind of parts?

86
00:04:11,764 --> 00:04:14,041
Mechanical governors to regulate output.

87
00:04:14,427 --> 00:04:17,166
With the EMP damage, we're figuring
out a lot of this from scratch.

88
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:20,041
- It's still a long way off.
- Black Jack Fairgrounds.

89
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:23,296
We walked through it
on our way back here.

90
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:24,865
It's become a trading post.

91
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:27,383
People from all over
the region are trading...

92
00:04:27,776 --> 00:04:29,443
food, information,

93
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:31,012
machine parts.

94
00:04:31,623 --> 00:04:32,800
They may have what we need.

95
00:04:32,803 --> 00:04:34,519
That's got to be a 200-mile drive.

96
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,246
That's a lot of gas for a "maybe."

97
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,234
If we can get one windmill working,

98
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:39,989
we'd save that much gas in a month.

99
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,346
If we get enough of them,
we could be off gas for good.

100
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:45,622
It might not be a bad idea

101
00:04:45,623 --> 00:04:47,677
to put a small party together
and go check it out.

102
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:50,407
Is anyone interested
in volunteering?

103
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,125
Season 1 - Episode 13
" Black Jack "

Transcript: swsub.com

[ www. seriessub.com ]

106
00:05:18,246 --> 00:05:19,596
I know it was you.

107
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:21,680
- What?
- Those men that grabbed me.

108
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:24,477
They said that someone
on my team sold us all out.

109
00:05:25,597 --> 00:05:27,006
They said it was you.

110
00:05:27,836 --> 00:05:28,936
And you believe them?

111
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:29,978
Tell me why I shouldn't.

112
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:31,521
Come on!
You're smart enough to know

113
00:05:31,522 --> 00:05:33,469
that they will say anything
to get you to talk.

114
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:36,122
Because you know
I owe you my life

115
00:05:36,123 --> 00:05:38,626
as much as you owe me yours
and because you just...

116
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:42,522
You just punched me in the face,
and I didn't hit you back.

117
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:46,564
- Who else is here?
- No one.

118
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:51,387
Victor showed up
just after D-day.

119
00:05:51,946 --> 00:05:53,836
But he only made it
for a couple of hours.

120
00:05:53,837 --> 00:05:55,033
Did you kill him?

121
00:05:56,364 --> 00:05:57,811
It was the radiation...

122
00:05:58,312 --> 00:05:59,335
from Denver.

123
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:04,660
No one else made it back here
to the rally point?

124
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:12,802
You going to tell me
how you got out of that room?

125
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,411
Three armed guys, cuffs.

126
00:06:15,412 --> 00:06:17,610
Three guys and cuffs
keep you in that room?

127
00:06:18,556 --> 00:06:20,330
One of them got too close.

128
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,530
Then there was only two.

129
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:24,150
Two was easy.

130
00:06:24,783 --> 00:06:26,500
From there,
I drove as fast as I could.

131
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:28,921
Saw the clouds
from D. C. and Baltimore.

132
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,526
Ran out of gas in West Virginia.

133
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:34,477
Went from refugee camp
to refugee camp

134
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:35,940
however I could.

135
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:41,013
I'm glad you made it.

136
00:06:42,923 --> 00:06:44,370
You left me.

137
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,361
I know.

138
00:06:48,345 --> 00:06:49,888
So what now?

139
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:55,634
We caught wind of some raiding parties
at interchanges here and here.

140
00:06:55,635 --> 00:06:56,830
But if you're careful,

141
00:06:56,831 --> 00:06:58,547
you should be safe
the rest of the way.

142
00:06:58,847 --> 00:07:01,316
Once you're at Black Jack,
watch your back.

143
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,033
Thieves?

144
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:05,522
It's not the thieves you got
to worry about, it's the guards.

145
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:07,914
They've got a reputation
of being really ruthless.

146
00:07:08,146 --> 00:07:10,046
Without the cops
or the National Guard,

147
00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:12,148
it's the only way they
guaranteed it's safe enough

148
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:13,316
to keep commerce going there.

149
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:16,035
You'd better take two or three
of the border patrol guys with you.

150
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,078
Just in case you run
into any surprises.

151
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,139
I'm coming, too.

152
00:07:19,698 --> 00:07:20,808
Not a chance in hell.

153
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:22,698
Would you know
a working mechanical governor

154
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:24,589
for a wind turbine
if you saw one?

155
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:30,667
I'm not taking
passengers out there.

156
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,702
Jake, Mr. Carmichael has a family.

157
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:37,265
I can help.

158
00:07:37,612 --> 00:07:39,040
You need me.

159
00:07:45,406 --> 00:07:46,718
Mrs. Green?

160
00:07:47,663 --> 00:07:48,898
What?

161
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:53,201
Eric told me that
April's pregnant.

162
00:07:54,146 --> 00:07:55,284
I just...

163
00:07:56,316 --> 00:07:58,399
- If there's anything that I can do...
- Mary...

164
00:07:58,804 --> 00:08:00,791
I think you've done quite enough.

165
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:08,335
Always got to be the first one
to jump in the fire, don't you?

166
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:09,512
Somebody's got to go.

167
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:12,503
Yeah, well, just seems
that someone is always you.

168
00:08:13,506 --> 00:08:16,477
Gray's having a few bags of salt
packed up for us to trade.

169
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:18,156
Smart.

170
00:08:18,157 --> 00:08:19,294
Who else is going?

171
00:08:19,563 --> 00:08:20,721
Apparently Heather.

172
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:24,020
Gray thinks I should take
a couple of guys from border patrol.

173
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:25,042
That's it?

174
00:08:25,043 --> 00:08:26,933
I'm not so sure
pulling them off patrol

175
00:08:26,934 --> 00:08:28,939
just to watch my back
is such a good idea.

176
00:08:29,518 --> 00:08:32,315
Besides, only a handful of them
even know what they're doing.

177
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:34,399
You don't think
I can watch your back?

178
00:08:34,842 --> 00:08:36,193
Why? You want to go?

179
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,840
Look, you've already seen
what it's like out there. I just...

180
00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:42,271
need to see it for myself.

181
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:45,126
Besides, I'm unemployed.
I'm not obsolete.

182
00:08:46,303 --> 00:08:47,692
Did you ask Mom?

183
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,049
Son, I am 59 years old.

184
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,039
I was mayor of this town
since the Carter administration.

185
00:08:54,263 --> 00:08:57,774
I'm a retired U. S. Army Ranger
and a combat veteran.

186
00:08:58,595 --> 00:09:00,061
Of course I asked your mother.

187
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:06,447
I could go downstairs and...

188
00:09:06,448 --> 00:09:08,762
warm some water
for a bath for you.

189
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:29,424
I didn't think I was ever
going to finish this.

190
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:45,919
Hey, uh...
we have a guest.

191
00:09:47,578 --> 00:09:48,947
This is Sarah.

192
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:08,144
Hey, Dale?

193
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:13,565
Hey. What are you
doing back there?

194
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:14,857
Uh, inventory.

195
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,053
Is it that bad?

196
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:19,989
Well, Mr. Houghton just showed up
with Mrs. Leigh's cut of the produce.

197
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:22,574
- What the hell is that?
- Yeah, exactly.

198
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:24,619
Well, did you point out
that it's rotten?

199
00:10:25,197 --> 00:10:27,879
They're all screwing me.
Hardly anyone's honoring their deals.

200
00:10:28,747 --> 00:10:30,290
My dad used to have to deal with stuff

201
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,200
like this all the time
down at the salt mine.

202
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:34,284
- Well, how did he do it?
- He just...

203
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:36,946
did whatever it took
to keep things running.

204
00:10:37,235 --> 00:10:39,029
I'm not shutting this place down.

205
00:10:41,094 --> 00:10:42,145
Actually,

206
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:44,161
I may have
good news about that.

207
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,573
But you might have
to take a little trip.

208
00:10:53,712 --> 00:10:55,082
I need to talk to you.

209
00:10:56,182 --> 00:10:57,204
All right.

210
00:10:58,073 --> 00:10:59,516
I shouldn't have sprung this on you.

211
00:10:59,517 --> 00:11:00,867
This is too weird...

212
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:02,757
What? What's weird?

213
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:09,474
I kissed you.

214
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:11,076
A month ago.

215
00:11:11,288 --> 00:11:12,581
And we haven't spoken since.

216
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,934
Generally, people speak
after something like that.

217
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:16,246
I'm just going to...

218
00:11:17,153 --> 00:11:18,311
You know...

219
00:11:22,979 --> 00:11:24,233
I know, I'm, uh...

220
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,127
- I'm sorry, really...
- You don't have to apologize.

221
00:11:27,128 --> 00:11:28,208
I'm not upset.

222
00:11:29,034 --> 00:11:30,905
I understand
why it happened.

223
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:32,545
Look, I want to go

224
00:11:32,546 --> 00:11:35,131
because I think I can help get
this place back up on its feet.

225
00:11:35,381 --> 00:11:37,272
That's it.
It's not a date.

226
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:39,548
Mr. Mayor?

227
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:41,420
I'm not the mayor anymore, Dale.
What is it?

228
00:11:41,849 --> 00:11:43,045
I need to come with you.

229
00:11:44,434 --> 00:11:45,502
I want to take it all.

230
00:11:45,528 --> 00:11:46,529
Trade it for something

231
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,833
I can actually use
to build this store up again.

232
00:11:49,071 --> 00:11:50,078
Whatever I don't use,

233
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,975
I'll put towards
supplies the town needs.

234
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:55,079
You're just going to give it
away to the town for nothing?

235
00:11:55,388 --> 00:11:58,224
It's the right thing to do, isn't it?
I just want to help.

236
00:12:01,214 --> 00:12:02,236
Well,

237
00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:04,744
this is one hell of a crew
we're putting together here.

238
00:12:05,883 --> 00:12:07,118
All right.

239
00:12:11,786 --> 00:12:14,005
Yeah, we'll leave
first thing in the morning.

240
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:17,584
You just happen to know
someone who just...

241
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,072
happened to wander into town?

242
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:25,204
Look at me.

243
00:12:26,014 --> 00:12:27,789
I'm not going to lie to you.

244
00:12:28,445 --> 00:12:29,680
But I can't...

245
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:34,367
I can't tell you any more
than I already have.

246
00:12:35,502 --> 00:12:36,544
So she's a friend, okay?

247
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:38,867
The last time you let someone
from that part of your life

248
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:41,309
- into our home, it was 4 years ago.
- This is different.

249
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,889
Well, you couldn't tell me
who he was.

250
00:12:43,503 --> 00:12:45,413
But you told me not to worry.

251
00:12:46,763 --> 00:12:47,805
Two weeks later, you left.

252
00:12:47,806 --> 00:12:49,614
I didn't see you again
until two months ago.

253
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:51,729
This is different.

254
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,282
Sam cried for weeks.

255
00:12:53,692 --> 00:12:54,947
I mean, he was four-years-old.

256
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:56,974
He didn't understand why
you'd want to leave him.

257
00:12:58,621 --> 00:12:59,636
I just...

258
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:04,051
I don't know if I can watch him
go through that again.

259
00:13:44,672 --> 00:13:46,355
What is going on here?

260
00:13:50,217 --> 00:13:51,545
Come here.

261
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,539
What is this?

262
00:13:57,987 --> 00:13:59,825
So I'm being watched.

263
00:14:00,644 --> 00:14:01,663
By who?

264
00:14:01,664 --> 00:14:02,930
My guess...

265
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:04,614
The Old Man.

266
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:06,529
Why...?

267
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:12,754
You still have the package, don't you?

268
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:20,137
He's been coordinating
this thing from the beginning,

269
00:14:20,222 --> 00:14:21,674
feeding us information.

270
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,548
Why would he turn on us now?

271
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:25,629
I don't know.

272
00:14:26,293 --> 00:14:28,410
You still have
a way to reach him?

273
00:14:29,252 --> 00:14:30,263
And have you...

274
00:14:30,264 --> 00:14:32,527
told him that you
made contact with me yet?

275
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:34,489
- Not yet.
- Then do it.

276
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:38,427
You do it...

277
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:40,745
and you see what he says.

278
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:09,197
"Thieves will be strung up."

279
00:15:14,866 --> 00:15:16,040
We need your guns.

280
00:15:26,637 --> 00:15:28,274
Pick them up on the way out.

281
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,627
Go ahead.

282
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,794
They're kidding about
the "strung up" thing, right?

283
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,246
They don't mean that literally.

284
00:16:24,988 --> 00:16:27,274
Looks like everyone
checks in here at the main tent.

285
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:29,221
They try and match
buyers and sellers.

286
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,058
They gave me three
possibilities of sellers

287
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:32,802
that might have the part
for the windmill.

288
00:16:32,803 --> 00:16:33,806
It's like eBay.

289
00:16:38,926 --> 00:16:39,937
Not like eBay.

290
00:16:39,938 --> 00:16:41,172
All right, look, um...

291
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:44,463
see if you can find the governor,
I'm going to stick with Dale.

292
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,362
See what he can trade for.

293
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:48,417
Let's do this thing quick
then we're out of here.

294
00:16:51,893 --> 00:16:53,036
Morning.

295
00:16:54,115 --> 00:16:55,242
Good morning.

296
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,414
Last night,
you fell asleep mid-sentence.

297
00:17:04,032 --> 00:17:05,901
- I did?
- Yes, you did.

298
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:08,787
Standing up right there
at the sink, shaving.

299
00:17:09,204 --> 00:17:11,954
You were going to tell me
what you've seen out there and...

300
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,441
Roger, I...

301
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:18,180
I don't want to push.

302
00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:21,788
I can't even imagine how awful
it was for you out there. I just...

303
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:22,888
A lot of it was.

304
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:25,647
Listen.

305
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:28,078
If I tell you something,

306
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:31,068
will you promise not to think...

307
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:33,229
I've lost it?

308
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,364
Of course.

309
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:37,470
Out there...

310
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:40,692
I saw... something.

311
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:44,242
I haven't told
anybody about it. I...

312
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,077
can't explain it.

313
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,396
The thing is...

314
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,946
it was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

315
00:17:56,262 --> 00:17:58,944
From there I ended up
in a tent city outside of Lexington.

316
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:01,124
So, what are they like?

317
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:03,072
The camps?

318
00:18:04,074 --> 00:18:06,351
Each is, uh... different.

319
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:08,744
Some are overcrowded, dangerous.

320
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,538
Some are better run.

321
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:12,602
Did you see people
with radiation poisoning?

322
00:18:12,603 --> 00:18:13,799
Some, yes.

323
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:15,110
What do they look like?

324
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,634
Lots of burns,

325
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:18,679
tissue loss, some vomiting.

326
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:19,913
Allie, Sam.

327
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,630
Upstairs.

328
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,582
How do you know my dad?

329
00:18:31,181 --> 00:18:32,685
We worked together.

330
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:34,885
Do you know how
to play football?

331
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,261
Of course, I do.
Doesn't everybody?

332
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:40,364
Not everybody.

333
00:18:40,365 --> 00:18:42,428
Hey, Samuel, now.

334
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:45,071
Come on.

335
00:18:50,183 --> 00:18:52,498
You know, these kids
have been through enough.

336
00:18:53,154 --> 00:18:54,640
I... I'm sorry.

337
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,457
Look, I don't know you.
I really don't want to.

338
00:18:57,824 --> 00:19:00,390
I know the kind of people
my husband works with.

339
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,072
No matter how close
the two of you are,

340
00:19:03,073 --> 00:19:05,348
I don't need my kids
exposed to that world.

341
00:19:07,374 --> 00:19:10,461
I've been married to
this man a long time.

342
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:13,355
I got pretty good at reading
between the lines.

343
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,984
Thanks, Mary.

344
00:19:30,775 --> 00:19:33,881
Why don't you and I sit down
together and have a drink?

345
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,206
Hey, how much?

346
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:47,868
- Beg pardon?
- How much?

347
00:19:48,602 --> 00:19:49,701
How much for what?

348
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:51,900
I don't know.

349
00:19:52,302 --> 00:19:53,325
An hour?

350
00:19:55,196 --> 00:19:56,392
An hour of what?

351
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,518
Wait, what?! No!

352
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,717
- How about a half hour?
- Is everything all right?

353
00:20:01,718 --> 00:20:04,129
- I'm not a hooker, pal!
- Then what are you doing here?

354
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,322
All right, that's enough.

355
00:20:05,785 --> 00:20:07,463
That's enough, man.

356
00:20:08,814 --> 00:20:11,052
- Is there a problem here?
- Hey, no. No.

357
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:12,614
No problem. Everything's fine.

358
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
No kidding, buddy.

359
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:19,292
You don't want to mess with
the guards here, it gets ugly, fast.

360
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:20,311
Thanks for the help.

361
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:23,453
Heather.

362
00:20:24,354 --> 00:20:25,929
Oh, my God, Ted.

363
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:30,485
I can't believe you're here.

364
00:20:31,783 --> 00:20:33,822
Jake, this is Ted Lewis.

365
00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:36,062
We grew up together
over in New Bern.

366
00:20:36,449 --> 00:20:38,185
This is Russell and Mike.

367
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:39,245
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.

368
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:40,520
I was so worried about you.

369
00:20:40,944 --> 00:20:43,393
We were going to send a party
to make contact with you guys,

370
00:20:43,394 --> 00:20:45,169
but the roads were
just so dangerous.

371
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:46,911
What are you guys doing here?

372
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,015
We're looking for parts
for a windmill generator.

373
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:50,025
Unsuccessfully.

374
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:53,112
Hey, there's a guy
we deal with here...

375
00:20:53,113 --> 00:20:54,881
who doesn't always
report to the main tent,

376
00:20:54,882 --> 00:20:56,994
but sometimes he's got
those specialty items

377
00:20:56,995 --> 00:20:58,646
nobody else has.
You want to see him?

378
00:20:58,647 --> 00:21:00,305
- Yeah, let's check it out.
- All right.

379
00:21:04,877 --> 00:21:07,110
Get this stuff out of here
before somebody sees it.

380
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,502
Why, what's wrong with it?

381
00:21:08,503 --> 00:21:09,523
Nickel...

382
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,284
the silver stuff
is all alloyed with it.

383
00:21:11,288 --> 00:21:12,295
So?

384
00:21:12,296 --> 00:21:13,987
So nickel absorbs radioactivity.

385
00:21:13,988 --> 00:21:15,661
Stuff that's been looted
from hot zones

386
00:21:15,662 --> 00:21:17,816
is making a lot of people sick.
No one wants it.

387
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:19,692
This stuff was nowhere
near the fallout.

388
00:21:19,888 --> 00:21:21,816
Look, kid,
if I can't sell it, I can't sell it.

389
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:23,113
What do you want me to tell you?

390
00:21:23,553 --> 00:21:24,768
What else do you got?

391
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:26,833
So what does have value here?

392
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:28,184
Not much of what you got.

393
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,228
Check the board over there.

394
00:21:31,955 --> 00:21:33,035
Why salt?

395
00:21:33,421 --> 00:21:34,598
It's a preservative.

396
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:36,180
An antibiotic.

397
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:39,826
You need 1,500 milligrams
of it a day to survive.

398
00:21:40,368 --> 00:21:43,050
The Romans actually
used it as currency.

399
00:21:43,475 --> 00:21:45,076
Whole African empires

400
00:21:45,077 --> 00:21:47,516
were based on the control
and supply of it.

401
00:21:47,728 --> 00:21:49,445
Wars have been fought over salt.

402
00:21:50,014 --> 00:21:51,576
Food, medical supplies,

403
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:54,142
a generator, all air-dropped,
all from China.

404
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:56,413
What?

405
00:21:56,722 --> 00:21:57,976
Yeah, we got an airdrop, too.

406
00:21:58,593 --> 00:22:00,774
The thing is...
it was from Germany.

407
00:22:01,584 --> 00:22:03,880
It's aid. It must be coming
from all over the world.

408
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,450
Well, if aid's coming
from all over the world then...

409
00:22:07,604 --> 00:22:08,877
who did this to us?

410
00:22:08,878 --> 00:22:10,363
A group of thugs a few weeks back,

411
00:22:10,364 --> 00:22:12,609
guys claiming to be
government contractors.

412
00:22:13,282 --> 00:22:15,833
So the mayor thought
we should make security a priority.

413
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:17,384
He resigned his office and...

414
00:22:17,906 --> 00:22:20,971
appointed Sheriff Constantino
acting city manager.

415
00:22:21,622 --> 00:22:23,016
The contractors,
who were they?

416
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:25,579
A security detail from a...

417
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,354
company called Ravenwood.

418
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,223
They came in looking for supplies.

419
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:31,548
A few of the shop owners resisted
and they got violent.

420
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,618
They killed three,
they injured eight.

421
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,798
They drove off with
a truckload of our diesel.

422
00:22:36,357 --> 00:22:37,611
But since then,

423
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,811
the sheriff's managed to
keep control of things.

424
00:22:40,814 --> 00:22:42,859
Crime really isn't a
problem for us anymore.

425
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,190
How'd he manage that?

426
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,958
- What is this?
- The news.

427
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,521
Where does all this come from?

428
00:22:57,869 --> 00:22:59,856
People pass through here
from all over.

429
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,306
Everyone brings
a little piece of the puzzle.

430
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:09,119
Do you have
something to write on?

431
00:23:11,126 --> 00:23:13,113
You guys don't
get out much, do you?

432
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:16,852
It gets better.

433
00:23:31,225 --> 00:23:32,672
What are the stars for?

434
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:34,099
Capitals.

435
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,276
Of what?

436
00:23:36,935 --> 00:23:38,208
The federal government.

437
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:40,716
Federal government? But...

438
00:23:42,106 --> 00:23:44,961
There are six stars up there.
Where's the president?

439
00:23:47,084 --> 00:23:48,203
Which one?

440
00:23:52,093 --> 00:23:53,675
Six presidents, I...

441
00:23:54,235 --> 00:23:56,647
I don't understand.
Who's in charge of the military?

442
00:23:56,695 --> 00:23:58,673
You're assuming
there's only one of those, too.

443
00:23:58,674 --> 00:23:59,850
All right, come on, let's go.

444
00:23:59,851 --> 00:24:02,992
Isn't there a line of succession,
so there's only one successor?

445
00:24:02,993 --> 00:24:04,094
The word is HHS.

446
00:24:04,095 --> 00:24:06,177
Secretary Charles is supposed
to be next in line,

447
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,261
but there are five other guys
who seem to think

448
00:24:08,262 --> 00:24:09,573
the attacks changed the rules.

449
00:24:09,593 --> 00:24:12,583
Senator Morrisette in Oregon,
Senator Tomarchio in Wyoming...

450
00:24:12,814 --> 00:24:15,376
They're all staking a claim,
gathering support.

451
00:24:15,627 --> 00:24:18,039
Then what happens?
How do they figure out who's in charge?

452
00:24:18,116 --> 00:24:19,736
Either they start making deals,

453
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:21,338
- compromise...
- Or?

454
00:24:22,202 --> 00:24:23,494
Or they fight.

455
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:27,237
Six bags of soybean seed,
and still it's...

456
00:24:27,517 --> 00:24:28,675
It's not enough.

457
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:31,279
Maybe this whole thing
was a bad idea.

458
00:24:32,066 --> 00:24:33,340
It's a start.

459
00:24:35,385 --> 00:24:36,716
Dale, wait up.

460
00:24:40,594 --> 00:24:43,565
It'd be a lot easier for you
to close the store, wouldn't it?

461
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:46,710
But instead, you're out here
trying to keep it going.

462
00:24:47,648 --> 00:24:49,596
I think Gracie
would be proud of you.

463
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:51,892
I think your mom would
be proud of you, too.

464
00:24:55,481 --> 00:24:58,221
When my mom died,
there was nothing I could do about it.

465
00:25:02,273 --> 00:25:04,163
But then after Mrs. Leigh...

466
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:10,105
Mitchell Cafferty
is going to get his due

467
00:25:10,414 --> 00:25:12,575
whether Gray finds him or not.

468
00:25:13,288 --> 00:25:16,009
Sooner or later, he's going
to cross the wrong person.

469
00:25:16,452 --> 00:25:18,768
One of these days,
it's going to catch up with him.

470
00:25:22,664 --> 00:25:24,940
I don't like to drink
while I'm working.

471
00:25:28,645 --> 00:25:31,114
To be honest, I have
difficulty understanding

472
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:33,911
how many ways I dislike you.

473
00:25:35,378 --> 00:25:36,902
You made a list?

474
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:39,680
Mrs. Green, I don't think I...

475
00:25:39,763 --> 00:25:41,798
This will work a lot better
if you just sit there

476
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:43,824
and listen to what
I have to say.

477
00:25:44,981 --> 00:25:47,952
What you and Eric
did to April was awful.

478
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:50,982
But she's going
to get through this

479
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,586
because she is
one strong woman.

480
00:25:54,454 --> 00:25:56,326
But there's a baby on the way,

481
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,026
and it happens
to be my grandchild.

482
00:25:59,682 --> 00:26:02,364
And I intend to do
everything I can

483
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,814
to protect it from this world.

484
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,422
But what you've done,
I can't protect it from.

485
00:26:09,657 --> 00:26:11,509
You've divided the family.

486
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:14,905
And as hard as that child's
life was going to be,

487
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,895
you have made it
so much more difficult.

488
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,159
I don't think that's something
I'll ever be able to forgive.

489
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:47,087
When I was a kid,
my mom split on my dad and I.

490
00:26:47,222 --> 00:26:49,035
She left with the guy
she met in Denver...

491
00:26:49,036 --> 00:26:50,347
This isn't about you.

492
00:26:50,477 --> 00:26:51,577
This will work a lot better

493
00:26:51,578 --> 00:26:54,104
if you just sit there
and listen to what I have to say.

494
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,500
I lay awake at night
terrified that I have

495
00:26:57,501 --> 00:26:59,699
put April in the same
position my dad was in...

496
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,438
Terrified that I have put this child

497
00:27:02,593 --> 00:27:04,869
in the same position that I was in.

498
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:09,091
My mistake was falling
in love with your son,

499
00:27:09,092 --> 00:27:11,101
I never should have let
it happen, but I did.

500
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,185
I know the cost.
I know how wrong it is.

501
00:27:15,944 --> 00:27:17,911
But the problem is,
he loves me, too.

502
00:27:18,953 --> 00:27:20,485
And I don't know
how you undo that.

503
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,943
So if you want
to go on hating me,

504
00:27:27,366 --> 00:27:28,790
if you never accept me...

505
00:27:30,629 --> 00:27:32,556
I can't say as I blame you.

506
00:27:38,243 --> 00:27:39,676
So I went to find help.

507
00:27:41,171 --> 00:27:43,161
I was more messed up
than I thought.

508
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:46,102
I wandered for days.

509
00:27:46,448 --> 00:27:47,770
Eventually...

510
00:27:48,784 --> 00:27:50,909
passed out in this... field.

511
00:27:51,947 --> 00:27:53,096
So there I was,

512
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,981
the middle of Nebraska

513
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,045
feeling like that was the place
I was going to die.

514
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,432
And then,
the strangest thing happened.

515
00:28:02,902 --> 00:28:05,324
There was a...
light in the sky.

516
00:28:06,312 --> 00:28:08,165
A bright light with a...

517
00:28:08,264 --> 00:28:09,858
ring around it.

518
00:28:10,031 --> 00:28:11,526
I...

519
00:28:12,515 --> 00:28:14,628
went... towards it.

520
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:17,556
Two miles later...

521
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:20,636
I stumbled into
the refugee camp.

522
00:28:23,564 --> 00:28:24,874
That light...

523
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:27,345
saved my life.

524
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:39,858
Been looking all over for you.

525
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:40,992
Did you find the part?

526
00:28:41,081 --> 00:28:42,084
I think so.

527
00:28:42,991 --> 00:28:44,303
Did you see the news?

528
00:28:44,342 --> 00:28:46,483
You looking to trade
for a mechanical governor?

529
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,261
Okay, let's talk trade.

530
00:28:51,977 --> 00:28:54,620
Eight bags of salt
at 35 pound per.

531
00:28:54,621 --> 00:28:55,893
Russell, what did they think?

532
00:28:55,894 --> 00:28:57,745
That they're the first ones
to think of this?

533
00:28:57,746 --> 00:29:00,543
These parts are in high demand.
I'm not giving it away.

534
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,028
- What more is it going to take?
- What more?

535
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:05,922
I turned away a guy
just this morning,

536
00:29:05,923 --> 00:29:08,604
and he offered 80 gallons
of diesel for the thing.

537
00:29:11,864 --> 00:29:13,138
Listen...

538
00:29:13,832 --> 00:29:15,819
We have more salt
than you can imagine.

539
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,366
We have the largest
salt mine for 400 miles

540
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:19,793
and we've got men to mine it.

541
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,568
But if you ever want
to see any of it,

542
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:23,921
we need to make
this deal right now, today.

543
00:29:23,922 --> 00:29:25,290
You understand?

544
00:29:30,114 --> 00:29:32,274
Okay, listen,
I'll vouch for him.

545
00:29:32,757 --> 00:29:34,281
All right?

546
00:29:38,538 --> 00:29:39,734
All right.

547
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,297
We got a deal.

548
00:29:41,934 --> 00:29:44,210
Wait here. I'll go get it.

549
00:29:44,847 --> 00:29:46,736
These things aren't
easy to make, you know.

550
00:29:46,737 --> 00:29:48,551
Not the good ones anyway.

551
00:29:50,866 --> 00:29:52,969
Dad, this is Russell.

552
00:29:53,104 --> 00:29:55,052
Hi. Good to meet you.

553
00:30:13,823 --> 00:30:15,019
Mr. Mayor?

554
00:30:15,096 --> 00:30:17,508
No kidding, Dale,
I am not the mayor anymore.

555
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:21,405
There's blood on them.

556
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,443
- You need some help there?
- What the hell is this?

557
00:30:28,156 --> 00:30:30,664
Are you conducting an inspection
or are we doing a deal?

558
00:30:30,665 --> 00:30:32,072
No, we're not supporting that.

559
00:30:32,073 --> 00:30:33,343
We'll find another solution.

560
00:30:33,344 --> 00:30:35,073
Well, then we're all done here,
aren't we?

561
00:30:35,074 --> 00:30:36,430
Why don't you get out?

562
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,571
Get out of here.

563
00:30:38,764 --> 00:30:39,922
Get out!

564
00:30:40,346 --> 00:30:41,426
Get out!

565
00:30:42,063 --> 00:30:43,491
Get out!

566
00:30:45,035 --> 00:30:46,134
You, too!

567
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,044
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

568
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,539
Guys, I'm so sorry.
We had no idea.

569
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,540
We need that part.

570
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:54,147
- And we're going to have to figure out
a way... - Where's Dale?

571
00:30:57,291 --> 00:31:00,086
Dale, where'd you get off to?
Don't just wander off like that.

572
00:31:03,316 --> 00:31:04,402
Did you steal that?

573
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,386
He's a bad guy.
He can't get away with that.

574
00:31:06,387 --> 00:31:08,713
We got to get that back before
they realize it's missing.

575
00:31:08,714 --> 00:31:10,561
It's okay I went out
the back. No one saw me.

576
00:31:10,562 --> 00:31:11,579
Hold it!

577
00:31:12,145 --> 00:31:13,145
Hold it!

578
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:14,599
Hold it!

579
00:31:18,938 --> 00:31:20,000
Hand him over.

580
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:22,234
He made a mistake, all right?

581
00:31:22,235 --> 00:31:23,444
He'll give back what he took.

582
00:31:23,445 --> 00:31:25,729
It's no harm done, all right?

583
00:31:31,174 --> 00:31:32,482
Excuse me. You know,

584
00:31:32,483 --> 00:31:33,853
he really is sorry and

585
00:31:33,854 --> 00:31:35,483
the property is back
where it belongs.

586
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:37,088
He can explain it to management.

587
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:39,397
I'm just asking you,
use a little discretion,

588
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,493
that's all, please.

589
00:31:42,357 --> 00:31:44,802
Excuse me, but could I talk
to whoever's in charge here?

590
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:46,246
Look, old man, I told you...

591
00:31:57,581 --> 00:31:58,791
That's enough!

592
00:32:14,782 --> 00:32:16,658
How long have you been
with the FBI?

593
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:18,424
14 years.

594
00:32:18,498 --> 00:32:20,066
Started right out of college.

595
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,091
It's dangerous out there, isn't it?

596
00:32:22,498 --> 00:32:25,116
I don't think your mom wants me
talking to you about that.

597
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:26,289
I'm not a kid.

598
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:28,166
It's pretty bad.

599
00:32:30,202 --> 00:32:31,931
My dad's been teaching me
how to shoot.

600
00:32:32,005 --> 00:32:33,116
I wonder if that's why.

601
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,620
He's been teaching you
how to shoot?

602
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:35,632
A little.

603
00:32:36,112 --> 00:32:37,322
I'm not sure if I like it.

604
00:32:37,495 --> 00:32:38,853
It's a weird feeling, but...

605
00:32:39,544 --> 00:32:40,961
it's the first time I can remember

606
00:32:40,962 --> 00:32:43,061
the two of us actually doing
something together.

607
00:32:46,814 --> 00:32:48,135
Where's your father?

608
00:32:49,086 --> 00:32:50,481
It's the old man.

609
00:32:51,641 --> 00:32:53,851
He's coming for us,
using us against each other.

610
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,432
He knows where you are.

611
00:32:55,654 --> 00:32:57,543
We need to go.
We need to move now.

612
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,615
No, I don't know.

613
00:32:58,701 --> 00:32:59,862
You don't know?

614
00:33:00,665 --> 00:33:03,085
This country is going
to be what we make of it.

615
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:05,048
There are only a
handful of other people

616
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,481
that know what we know.

617
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:09,778
We have to keep fighting.
We have to stay alive.

618
00:33:11,479 --> 00:33:14,727
We go see him, and if,
if he is behind this,

619
00:33:14,813 --> 00:33:15,925
we take him out.

620
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:17,492
Take him out?

621
00:33:17,591 --> 00:33:19,271
Yeah, I mean,
how long can we run?

622
00:33:19,332 --> 00:33:21,617
How long can my family run?

623
00:33:23,445 --> 00:33:24,704
We pay him a visit,

624
00:33:24,705 --> 00:33:25,951
we eliminate the threat.

625
00:33:25,952 --> 00:33:28,853
We go straight at him, there is
a chance we don't come back.

626
00:33:37,818 --> 00:33:39,287
You're leaving.

627
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:43,609
She walked in that door,
I knew right away you'd be leaving.

628
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:50,006
You have nothing to worry about.

629
00:33:50,451 --> 00:33:52,290
It's not me that
I'm worried about.

630
00:33:52,438 --> 00:33:54,228
Our children need a father.

631
00:33:55,764 --> 00:33:58,619
Whatever you're going to do,
it can't be more important than that.

632
00:34:01,993 --> 00:34:03,314
Do you trust her?

633
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,661
I have to.

634
00:34:10,003 --> 00:34:11,954
If she's a threat to this
family's safety,

635
00:34:13,275 --> 00:34:14,646
if she's a threat to you...

636
00:34:15,658 --> 00:34:16,769
you kill her.

637
00:34:19,165 --> 00:34:20,265
You understand?

638
00:34:34,604 --> 00:34:35,639
Get in!

639
00:34:35,759 --> 00:34:36,778
Hurry!

640
00:34:49,913 --> 00:34:50,970
Stop the car.

641
00:34:51,721 --> 00:34:54,100
Jake, this car will not fit
through that barricade.

642
00:34:54,396 --> 00:34:55,779
Stop the car now!

643
00:35:12,901 --> 00:35:14,252
Thanks. I, uh,

644
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,033
I don't know how this would have
turned out if it weren't for you guys.

645
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:20,634
- Well, you'll make it up to us someday.
- However we can help.

646
00:35:20,635 --> 00:35:23,044
Those windmills you're looking
to build... I was thinking.

647
00:35:23,045 --> 00:35:24,801
Guys down at the
old brake assembly,

648
00:35:24,802 --> 00:35:26,614
maybe they can convert
part of their plant,

649
00:35:26,884 --> 00:35:27,926
help build what you need.

650
00:35:27,984 --> 00:35:30,106
I know the town could use
a good source of salt.

651
00:35:31,356 --> 00:35:33,652
Looks like we're going
to be seeing a lot of each other.

652
00:35:33,691 --> 00:35:35,880
- Thanks again, guys. Take care.
- Thank you so much.

653
00:35:41,605 --> 00:35:42,685
What?

654
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:51,677
Jake, I saw the governor.

655
00:35:51,773 --> 00:35:53,220
I saw how it's put together.

656
00:35:53,471 --> 00:35:54,686
I was talking to Ted,

657
00:35:54,744 --> 00:35:57,599
and I think between the two of us,
we can help to make more of them,

658
00:35:58,236 --> 00:35:59,490
but I have to go with him.

659
00:36:00,475 --> 00:36:03,137
- Go with them? Wait a minute.
- No, think about it.

660
00:36:03,234 --> 00:36:05,780
We don't have the resources
to do this the right way.

661
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,031
They've got the machines

662
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:08,596
and the guys who
know how to use them.

663
00:36:08,597 --> 00:36:11,407
With a dozen full-sized windmills,
you could power the whole town,

664
00:36:11,408 --> 00:36:13,477
run the med center,
forget about gas.

665
00:36:13,478 --> 00:36:15,685
You're just going to leave?
Right now?

666
00:36:16,025 --> 00:36:17,415
It won't be for very long.

667
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:18,774
Just a few days.

668
00:36:19,794 --> 00:36:20,829
But I know I can help.

669
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,528
I think I need to do this.

670
00:36:24,073 --> 00:36:25,664
You think this is a good idea?

671
00:36:28,506 --> 00:36:30,575
You know why things
didn't work out between us?

672
00:36:31,966 --> 00:36:33,356
I'm not dangerous.

673
00:36:34,468 --> 00:36:35,658
I'm crossword puzzles

674
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:37,974
and flannel pajamas and
the occasional lite beer.

675
00:36:37,975 --> 00:36:39,998
I was never going to be
hazardous to you.

676
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,143
- That's how you tick.
- No, it isn't.

677
00:36:42,452 --> 00:36:43,796
Of course it is.

678
00:36:44,275 --> 00:36:45,295
But it's okay.

679
00:36:45,606 --> 00:36:48,387
If it wasn't, your dad would
probably be dead right now,

680
00:36:48,945 --> 00:36:51,723
you and I would have
never met on that bus.

681
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:53,961
So I'm taking a page out of your book.

682
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,292
I'm throwing caution to the wind.

683
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:58,070
I'm gonna help turn the lights
on for everyone back home.

684
00:37:00,713 --> 00:37:02,411
Just for a few days.

685
00:37:04,553 --> 00:37:06,135
You worried about me?

686
00:37:09,318 --> 00:37:11,247
Come back in one piece.

687
00:37:49,012 --> 00:37:50,015
Dad?

688
00:37:50,355 --> 00:37:51,806
We're out of the good toothpaste.

689
00:37:51,868 --> 00:37:55,217
Oh, well, here's the...
The new stuff that Mr. Daley made.

690
00:37:56,511 --> 00:37:58,965
- This isn't toothpaste.
- Yeah, it is.

691
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,894
Are you playing a joke on me?

692
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,123
Hey, you know, uh,

693
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:09,549
when you were teething,
you never cried.

694
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,096
See, 'cause most babies,

695
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,010
they cry, but not you.

696
00:38:14,797 --> 00:38:16,017
And your...

697
00:38:16,202 --> 00:38:19,505
mom was worried and the...
doctors were worried,

698
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:21,604
but not me.

699
00:38:22,577 --> 00:38:24,784
Because I knew you weren't sick,

700
00:38:25,694 --> 00:38:27,252
you weren't hurt,

701
00:38:27,299 --> 00:38:28,873
you were just brave.

702
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:31,899
'Cause you're
the bravest person I know.

703
00:38:32,408 --> 00:38:33,982
You always have been.

704
00:38:35,295 --> 00:38:36,298
Dad?

705
00:38:37,354 --> 00:38:39,206
What are you talking about?

706
00:38:40,934 --> 00:38:41,984
Sam,

707
00:38:44,345 --> 00:38:45,966
I have to go to work tomorrow.

708
00:38:46,537 --> 00:38:48,790
It's a very important meeting,
but it's quite far away,

709
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:50,441
so I might not be back
for a day or two,

710
00:38:50,442 --> 00:38:51,985
and I just wanted you to know that.

711
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,607
Are you mad at me?

712
00:38:55,495 --> 00:38:56,503
What?

713
00:38:57,298 --> 00:38:58,323
You're leaving.

714
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,249
You listen to me.

715
00:39:07,977 --> 00:39:09,200
There is nothing that

716
00:39:09,321 --> 00:39:10,642
you, your sister or your mother

717
00:39:10,643 --> 00:39:12,927
could ever do that would
make me want to leave you.

718
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,187
I, uh...

719
00:39:18,878 --> 00:39:21,348
I, I love you.
You understand that, right?

720
00:40:03,615 --> 00:40:05,319
Hey, welcome home.

721
00:40:06,084 --> 00:40:07,208
Success?

722
00:40:07,949 --> 00:40:10,107
- You get the part?
- We had it...

723
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:11,836
and we lost it.

724
00:40:12,503 --> 00:40:13,935
Uh, where's Heather?

725
00:40:14,427 --> 00:40:16,007
Getting the lights back on.

726
00:40:16,427 --> 00:40:18,390
You do realize that
what happened today

727
00:40:18,391 --> 00:40:19,699
was unnecessary?

728
00:40:21,206 --> 00:40:22,292
And stupid?

729
00:40:22,984 --> 00:40:24,556
You got a lot
of responsibility now.

730
00:40:24,557 --> 00:40:26,444
You're going to have to learn
how to be smart.

731
00:40:26,445 --> 00:40:27,454
I understand.

732
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,355
And you,
you knew that this car

733
00:40:32,356 --> 00:40:33,991
was not going to fit
through that gate?

734
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,577
I know.

735
00:40:36,132 --> 00:40:38,332
I heard you talking to me,
and I knew you were right.

736
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,779
Why didn't you stop the car?

737
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:41,689
I don't know.

738
00:40:43,328 --> 00:40:44,659
What'd you get?

739
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,203
Look at all this stuff.

740
00:40:49,482 --> 00:40:50,852
Oh, you did great.

741
00:40:51,296 --> 00:40:52,588
This is nothing.

742
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:55,652
Skylar, how much of the salt mine
does your family own?

743
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:57,852
I don't know. Why?

744
00:40:59,086 --> 00:41:01,035
'Cause I think we may be rich.

745
00:41:04,605 --> 00:41:06,013
You okay?

746
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,573
Look, uh...

747
00:41:14,174 --> 00:41:16,142
I am glad you made it.

748
00:41:17,898 --> 00:41:20,252
We leave first thing
in the morning.

749
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:08,352
