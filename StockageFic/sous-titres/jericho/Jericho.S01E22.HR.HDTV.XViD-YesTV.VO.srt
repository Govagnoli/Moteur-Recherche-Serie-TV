<i>Previously on </i>Jericho

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,647
Oh, my God... Ted !

3
00:00:04,787 --> 00:00:06,302
We grew up together over in New Bern.

4
00:00:06,402 --> 00:00:08,690
- You just going to leave?
- It won't be for very long.

5
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:11,162
Johnston, you SOB.

6
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,966
How the hell did you lose an election?

7
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:15,722
No. The question is, how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?

8
00:00:15,734 --> 00:00:17,190
They get tired of you being sheriff?

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,707
<i>Can we buy some more of these things?

10
00:00:18,731 --> 00:00:20,613
Ten wind turbines for, let's say...

11
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,978
ten percent of your spring crop.

12
00:00:22,078 --> 00:00:23,864
Okay, we'll give you the food.

13
00:00:23,964 --> 00:00:26,329
We're going to need ten Jericho men
to help us build them.

14
00:00:26,532 --> 00:00:28,066
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.

15
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:31,087
<i>You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china.

16
00:00:31,703 --> 00:00:33,643
It's a full inventory of Jericho.

17
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,622
They slid it up like they own it.

18
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:37,126
They're making mortar rounds.

19
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,714
They're getting ready for war.

20
00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:39,877
Hold it!

21
00:00:40,756 --> 00:00:43,321
We wanted to break the machine.
Stop the factory.

22
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,461
Where's Heather?

23
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,166
She's dead, Jake.

24
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,264
Everybody go!

25
00:00:49,765 --> 00:00:51,783
<i>Jericho is about to be invaded.

26
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:55,780
<i>We'll do this day and night
for as long as it takes.

27
00:00:56,328 --> 00:00:59,003
Most of you have no idea of
what's coming.

28
00:00:59,337 --> 00:01:01,277
This isn't a fight about land.

29
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:04,365
This is a fight for our very existence.

30
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,955
I know this has great artistic merit,
but...

31
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:31,048
i'm taking these shoes off
in ten minutes.

32
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:32,581
So, if you don't want
to have to hide my toes...

33
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:34,259
Oh, Gail, make yourself comfortable.

34
00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:36,684
We can't really do this
without the best man anyway.

35
00:01:36,856 --> 00:01:38,014
Where is Jake?

36
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:40,709
I don't see him.

37
00:01:41,053 --> 00:01:42,868
Grandpa seems to be missing, too.

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,246
Take a wild guess where they are.

39
00:01:46,013 --> 00:01:47,014
Right.

40
00:01:50,171 --> 00:01:52,455
Oh, Beth.
It's so nice to see you, dear.

41
00:02:10,896 --> 00:02:11,978
I need your help.

42
00:02:12,078 --> 00:02:14,381
We need to go over
to the medical center.

43
00:02:26,342 --> 00:02:29,674
- Is everyone in there?
- Yeah. We're just waiting for you.

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,639
How is it going out there?

45
00:02:32,764 --> 00:02:34,376
They took Talbot's farm.

46
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,581
How many men?

47
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:38,053
I'd say 60... 70.

48
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:40,278
That's probably just
an advance team.

49
00:02:40,513 --> 00:02:43,081
I would imagine they got more than that
up the road in reserve.

50
00:02:43,144 --> 00:02:46,208
Constantino has us outnumbered
and outgunned.

51
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:49,310
If we split our force, and try
to defend each one of these farms,

52
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,714
he's goino toverwhelm us.

53
00:02:50,824 --> 00:02:52,216
So what are you saying?

54
00:02:52,437 --> 00:02:53,605
I'm saying we don't split up.

55
00:02:53,705 --> 00:02:56,112
We choose a place to stand together,

56
00:02:56,346 --> 00:02:58,673
deliver a good, hard counterpunch.
Let them know that,

57
00:02:58,773 --> 00:03:01,505
if they intend to take from us,
it's going to cost them dearly.

58
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,881
How?

59
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:04,784
Well, right here.
Stanley Richmond's farm.

60
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,973
It's the last place
before this road divides,

61
00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:09,358
and they start taking ground
faster than we can keep up.

62
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,861
Plus which it's the highest point
in the whole area.

63
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:15,969
There's where we make our stand.

64
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:24,236
Deputy Perkins just radioed back.

65
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,889
He told the farm is secured.

66
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,412
Let's go get the rest of them.

67
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,114
Let's go!

68
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,537
This one's alive.

<i>6 YEARS AGO

74
00:04:34,057 --> 00:04:36,232
- Grandpa, you're drunk.
- Yeah!

75
00:04:37,582 --> 00:04:38,940
Thank you, darling

76
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,414
Keep 'em coming.

77
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:44,151
Gail's going to get so mad at you
for getting her boy drunk.

78
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,759
I've got Gail wrapped
around my little finger.

79
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,975
Says the guy who taught me
to fly his crop duster when I was 13,

80
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:52,369
then told Mom I was lying
when I mentioned it.

81
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:55,208
I was so jealous.
My mom knew that you let him fly,

82
00:04:55,308 --> 00:04:57,832
and she wouldn't let me go
anywhere near you.

83
00:04:58,379 --> 00:04:59,396
You see, Jake would...

84
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:02,248
Jake would come over and tell me
all the stories you told him.

85
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,437
I loved...

86
00:05:03,546 --> 00:05:05,424
I loved the one about the peanuts.

87
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,468
What the hell are you talking about?

88
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:13,629
The peanuts in World War II.

89
00:05:14,896 --> 00:05:16,801
He means the "Nuts" story, Grandpa.

90
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:19,234
Not peanuts.
There were no peanuts involved.

91
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:21,847
So what's the story?
Tell me the story, somebody.

92
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,294
What? It's his story.

93
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:24,402
All right.

94
00:05:26,134 --> 00:05:29,135
World War II.
The winter of 1944.

95
00:05:29,235 --> 00:05:32,424
The Nazis penetrated the Allied lines,

96
00:05:32,846 --> 00:05:34,238
and surrounded...

97
00:05:34,755 --> 00:05:37,978
a division of Americans
in a little town called Bastogne,

98
00:05:38,862 --> 00:05:42,538
freezing, starving and running out
of ammunition, but they knew...

99
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:44,619
that they had to hold that ground.

100
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:46,215
Just before Christmas,

101
00:05:46,372 --> 00:05:49,028
the Nazis sent a note

102
00:05:49,128 --> 00:05:50,870
to the American commander

103
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,089
telling him that he could

104
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:55,209
surrender and save the rt of his men,

105
00:05:55,309 --> 00:05:57,050
or they could stay and fight.

106
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,943
The American commander

107
00:05:59,076 --> 00:06:02,487
sent a one-word reply
to the Wehrmacht commander,

108
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:05,690
and it said...
- ... "Nuts."

109
00:06:08,006 --> 00:06:09,233
Why did he say, "Nuts"?

110
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,980
It means, "Go to hell!"

111
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,582
Why didn't he just say, "Go to hell"?

112
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:13,986
Because he said, "Nuts. "

113
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:20,025
Gail, my sweetheart,
you look beautiful.

114
00:06:20,174 --> 00:06:21,285
Save it, Dal.

115
00:06:21,488 --> 00:06:24,038
Was it your idea
to get my son drunk tonight?

116
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:31,094
Right. Okay.
Everybody back to the reception.

117
00:06:31,462 --> 00:06:33,527
- Come on.
- But I'm hammered.

118
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,733
And I want to talk to you.

119
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:38,283
Have a cup of coffee, Stanley.

120
00:06:39,684 --> 00:06:40,685
Here.

121
00:06:42,031 --> 00:06:43,423
Well, what's this?

122
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,533
As your brother's best man,
you are required to give a toast,

123
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,602
so I wrote down a few thoughts,

124
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:50,874
some things that
you might want to say.

125
00:06:51,414 --> 00:06:53,244
You think I was going to wing it?

126
00:06:56,988 --> 00:06:59,257
Let's go take some pictures, okay?

127
00:07:05,902 --> 00:07:06,966
What's going on?

128
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:16,834
Mr. Green, I have access
to a keyhole military satellite

129
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,816
that I can use to track New Bern's
movements in the field today.

130
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,753
- Beg pardon?
- It's real.

131
00:07:22,853 --> 00:07:24,148
The one restriction...

132
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:27,770
is that no one can know
where you're getting this information.

133
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:31,416
Tell them I'm... scouting in the field,
tell them what you want...

134
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:33,672
but the satellite must remain a secret.

135
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,022
Sounds good.

136
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:40,447
- That's it?
- What do you want me to say?

137
00:07:40,564 --> 00:07:42,971
I get it. Man has a satellite.
Doesn't want anyone to know.

138
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:44,945
- But...
- I am about to go to war,

139
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:47,779
with New Bern, Kansas,
the home of the nearest Costco.

140
00:07:47,975 --> 00:07:50,635
Today is already just about
as weird as I can handle.

141
00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:52,661
I'm not asking any more questions.

142
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:58,330
Mom, Dad,

143
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,931
there's a chance we may have
to leave here today,

144
00:08:01,963 --> 00:08:04,357
and we might not be able
to make it back, so...

145
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:07,048
I just wanted to...

146
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,430
We just...

147
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,292
wanted to pay our respects.

148
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,968
Remember I told you about that witch,
from the IRS?

149
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:16,314
The one that wanted

150
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,884
to take everything
you've ever worked for?

151
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:20,182
Mom, Dad...

152
00:08:21,137 --> 00:08:22,435
this is Mimi.

153
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,211
Hello.

154
00:08:31,165 --> 00:08:32,823
It's nice to finally meet you.

155
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:37,504
I really love your son.

156
00:08:38,787 --> 00:08:40,914
And, of course,
Bonnie is...

157
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:42,463
she's just wonderful.

158
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:46,200
And I've really enjoyed
living with them and...

159
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:48,437
- Oh, great.
- What?

160
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,167
I didn't say we were living together.

161
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:53,764
We're not married.

162
00:08:56,631 --> 00:09:00,042
I'm so sorry.
I certainly... I...

163
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,892
Is everything a joke to you?

164
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:11,328
I figure one day we're going
to be buried here ourselves,

165
00:09:11,703 --> 00:09:12,705
and I...

166
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,145
think it would be nice if...

167
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,185
our kids came and,
and joked around with us.

168
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:24,177
I hope that's not
for a really long time.

169
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:43,839
How we doing?

170
00:09:43,939 --> 00:09:46,823
We've got about 200 men.
That includes Dale's crew.

171
00:09:47,346 --> 00:09:48,754
We got more coming, right?

172
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:52,071
They're trickling in. It's taking
a lot longer than we thought.

173
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,341
Saying good-bye to their families.

174
00:09:56,511 --> 00:09:58,521
Get on down to the pass.
Get everybody organized.

175
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:01,270
We don't have a whole lot of time
before their advance unit hits.

176
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:03,343
- Not you.
- Why not?

177
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:06,152
Because these people
elected you their leader.

178
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:08,064
We protect you at all costs.

179
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,873
And, besides, in a few minutes,
I'm going to need your help.

180
00:10:10,998 --> 00:10:12,001
Help with what?

181
00:10:13,602 --> 00:10:14,666
Arming our tank.

182
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,946
Our daughter is out there carrying
a rifle and... I'm in here.

183
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:27,636
Sam needs you here.

184
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:30,655
You know, Allie's safe.

185
00:10:31,418 --> 00:10:32,761
She's been assigned to Town Hall,

186
00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:34,891
and the fighting is miles from there.

187
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,388
Right now, there really isn't
anything else you can be doing.

188
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,060
Here we go.

189
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:52,146
<i>Jake, you are about
to have company.

190
00:10:52,246 --> 00:10:53,275
Already?

191
00:10:53,605 --> 00:10:55,654
<i>New Bern is on its way.
There are...

192
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,829
<i>70, maybe... 80 men.

193
00:10:58,142 --> 00:10:59,667
Is that tank there yet?

194
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:02,909
They're trying to load it
with that mortar round right now.

195
00:11:04,505 --> 00:11:06,117
I think you're gonna need it.

196
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:10,223
All right, let's get ready!
They're coming!

197
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:12,117
Get some ammo down here!

198
00:11:16,857 --> 00:11:17,858
What is it?

199
00:11:24,492 --> 00:11:25,696
I'm being tracked.

200
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:28,313
Tracked?
What do you mean?

201
00:11:28,548 --> 00:11:31,599
Someone is trying to trace my location
through the satellite.

202
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,321
- Well, can they?
- If they have time, yes.

203
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,270
Do you know who it is?

204
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:40,337
My guess is, it's... Valente.

205
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:46,938
What him?
From... Homeland Security?

206
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:48,909
I don't know who he's working for now,

207
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:51,131
but he told Sarah
to get the bomb any way she could

208
00:11:51,231 --> 00:11:52,902
and to eliminate all witnesses.

209
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:56,958
All the witnesses.

210
00:11:57,552 --> 00:11:59,289
- Shut it down.
- No, I can't.

211
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:03,443
We just have to make sure we disconnect
the feed before he finishes the trace.

212
00:13:53,491 --> 00:13:54,493
I don't get it.

213
00:13:54,782 --> 00:13:57,379
- Why are they just standing there?
- I don't know.

214
00:13:58,459 --> 00:13:59,867
Do we fire the first shot?

215
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:10,726
New Bern's here.

216
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,292
Get into position.

217
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,215
We're gonna need that tank.

218
00:15:06,566 --> 00:15:07,623
Having a good time?

219
00:15:09,628 --> 00:15:12,152
By the way, I think I saw April
making out with Shep Cale.

220
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:13,402
All right, all right.

221
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,194
You need to stop drinking.

222
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,590
Listen.

223
00:15:20,137 --> 00:15:22,121
Read this.
It's a speech.

224
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:24,891
Figure you should have something ready,
so you don't embarrass yourself.

225
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,011
You mean so I don't embarrass you,
because you don't have to worry.

226
00:15:28,717 --> 00:15:30,767
Is that how you spell
"venereal disease"?

227
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,831
This day is important to me, okay?

228
00:15:33,294 --> 00:15:34,736
Just because your life's a big joke

229
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,882
doesn't mean you have
to treat mine that way.

230
00:15:37,094 --> 00:15:38,557
Why is my life a joke?

231
00:15:38,657 --> 00:15:40,546
- Just read the speech.
- No, seriously, Eric,

232
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:43,666
why is my life a joke?
- I'm not getting into this right now.

233
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:46,580
All right.

234
00:15:49,087 --> 00:15:51,791
You think people don't wonder
what you've been doing?

235
00:15:51,926 --> 00:15:54,454
You spend all that time
in flight school getting your license.

236
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:56,267
Instead of using it,
you come back here,

237
00:15:56,383 --> 00:15:58,544
hanging out like it's the summer
after high school.

238
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:01,176
Hauling stuff for Emily's dad.

239
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,398
If I'm such a joke,
then why'd you want me as your best man?

240
00:16:12,607 --> 00:16:14,121
You didn't want me, did you?

241
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:16,318
No, not really.

242
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,517
Where's that tank?

243
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,662
We're not going to last long
against those trucks.

244
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:37,071
We have to hold out.

245
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:43,893
Damn it!

246
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:52,579
- Got to keep drawing their fire,
all right?  - Got It.

247
00:16:56,941 --> 00:16:58,272
Give me another mag.

248
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:01,462
Where are you going?

249
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,067
We'll never get a clean shot from here.
I need to get up that hill...

250
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:05,318
and shot on the gunner.

251
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:07,555
- I got your back.
- All right.

252
00:17:07,655 --> 00:17:09,212
Cover him!

253
00:17:34,695 --> 00:17:37,357
Why eliminate witnesses?

254
00:17:38,476 --> 00:17:40,830
I mean, whoever's tracking you,
they either...

255
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:43,319
want to use the bomb
for themselves or...

256
00:17:43,994 --> 00:17:46,193
they want to keep you
from using it, but...

257
00:17:46,352 --> 00:17:48,957
either way,
what difference do witnesses make?

258
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,836
The bombs have fingerprints,
don't they? Something that...

259
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,556
make them traceable.
I remember reading that.

260
00:18:20,504 --> 00:18:22,375
It's the uranium.
It has...

261
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,831
It has a specific signature.

262
00:18:27,622 --> 00:18:30,322
It places the origin of the device
where it was made.

263
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:33,490
So there were dozens of these things
used in the attacks, right?

264
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,805
And now you have the last one.

265
00:18:38,815 --> 00:18:41,553
I don't think these people are looking
at this thing as a weapon.

266
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,065
It's more than that.
It's...

267
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,859
Evidence.

268
00:18:50,155 --> 00:18:52,760
It's the smoking gun
behind the greatest crime

269
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:54,457
in the history of the world.

270
00:18:56,576 --> 00:18:57,632
The bomb...

271
00:18:58,254 --> 00:19:00,180
it could expose the people...

272
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:02,534
who were responsible for the attacks.

273
00:19:03,394 --> 00:19:05,004
That's why they need it back.

274
00:20:22,325 --> 00:20:23,558
Did u see what I just did?

275
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:25,275
Holy crap.
That was...

276
00:20:25,989 --> 00:20:26,992
<i>Holy crap!

277
00:20:28,404 --> 00:20:30,175
All right, that bought us some time.

278
00:20:30,516 --> 00:20:32,732
But they'll be back,
and there'll be more of them.

279
00:20:32,905 --> 00:20:34,542
And it won't be near as easy
next time.

280
00:20:34,642 --> 00:20:36,802
Easy?
You thought that was easy?

281
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:40,950
Dad?

282
00:20:41,664 --> 00:20:42,667
What's wrong?

283
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,514
Clear the table!
Clear it!

284
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,301
- Clear it!
- I'm gonna go get Kenchy.

285
00:20:54,482 --> 00:20:56,275
- Get my mom!
- We'll need towels.

286
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,733
And some antiseptic,
and some alcohol.

287
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,674
- We need alcohol.
- Get a towel!

288
00:21:00,788 --> 00:21:02,342
Get me some alcohol!

289
00:21:05,302 --> 00:21:08,215
Here we go.
Give me that, come on!

290
00:21:08,582 --> 00:21:10,183
Okay, all right.

291
00:21:12,402 --> 00:21:13,444
Keep the pressure on.

292
00:21:13,617 --> 00:21:15,469
What?
Keep it on! Keep the pressure.

293
00:21:15,952 --> 00:21:17,109
<i>Jake, come in.

294
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,182
Nice work out there.

295
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:24,016
<i>Tell your father that
they're coming back around.

296
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:26,856
He's been shot.

297
00:21:29,576 --> 00:21:30,830
I'm sorry.

298
00:21:36,637 --> 00:21:37,964
You know what to do, right?

299
00:21:38,094 --> 00:21:39,337
<i>Keep pressure on the wound,

300
00:21:39,437 --> 00:21:42,613
<i>and there should be some morphine
syrettes in the... supplies I gave you.

301
00:21:42,808 --> 00:21:44,062
Yeah, we've got it.

302
00:21:44,227 --> 00:21:45,297
Listen, Jake.

303
00:21:45,683 --> 00:21:47,670
<i>People are gonna be
looking to you now.

304
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:49,242
<i>You know what I mean?

305
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:53,477
Okay, the guys will be back.

306
00:21:53,766 --> 00:21:55,541
They retreated to Talbot's farm.

307
00:21:55,665 --> 00:21:58,192
<i>My guess is,
they're waiting for reinforcements,

308
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:00,538
<i>so you should have a little time
to regroup out there.

309
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:01,953
<i>Just keep the radio close,

310
00:22:02,053 --> 00:22:03,380
and I'll update you.

311
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,273
Out.

312
00:22:07,015 --> 00:22:08,018
Out.

313
00:22:20,016 --> 00:22:22,023
Please, I need to talk
whoever's in charge.

314
00:22:22,138 --> 00:22:23,138
Right over there.

315
00:22:30,214 --> 00:22:31,719
Excuse me, sir?

316
00:22:32,761 --> 00:22:33,822
Colonel Hoffman.

317
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,943
You don't have to call me sir,
unless you plan to enlist.

318
00:22:37,043 --> 00:22:39,649
There's a city called New Bern.
It has a munitions factory.

319
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:42,940
It's planning to overrun the town
of Jericho. People are gonna get killed.

320
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,969
They tried to kill me,
but I got away.

321
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,327
- You've got to help these people.
- Where is this?

322
00:22:47,462 --> 00:22:49,565
Kansas, not far from
the Colorado border.

323
00:22:51,748 --> 00:22:54,637
I wish I could help. My orders are
to secure the roads in this area.

324
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,277
- But, sir...
- I don't get to make these decisions.

325
00:22:56,392 --> 00:22:57,927
I'm just a government employee.

326
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:00,974
Which government?

327
00:23:04,858 --> 00:23:06,247
United States.

328
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:09,490
Are you all right, ma'am?

329
00:23:09,683 --> 00:23:12,337
We heard there were six different people
claiming the presidency.

330
00:23:12,472 --> 00:23:15,413
There were. In fact, there are still
a couple of holdouts...

331
00:23:15,714 --> 00:23:17,874
Texas, a bloc in the East.

332
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,855
The new federal government's
been restored in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

333
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:22,374
Colonel, this is an emergency.

334
00:23:22,482 --> 00:23:24,946
You have to go to Jericho. The fighting
could be happening right now.

335
00:23:25,062 --> 00:23:26,200
I am very sorry, ma'am.

336
00:23:26,586 --> 00:23:28,913
Casper, you see she gets back
to the medical unit.

337
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:30,032
Come on, ma'am.

338
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,776
Get 'em out.

339
00:23:43,438 --> 00:23:44,634
Get 'em out.

340
00:23:48,782 --> 00:23:50,364
Clear everyone out.

341
00:24:00,435 --> 00:24:01,726
You listen...

342
00:24:04,605 --> 00:24:08,612
This place,
is where you survive.

343
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,828
You make a stand here,
you hear?

344
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,143
We will.

345
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:23,400
I'm sorry you have to see this.

346
00:24:25,762 --> 00:24:27,263
You've been through enough.

347
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,539
Dad...
Dad, stop.

348
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:32,510
You're stronger than you think
you are, though.

349
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:34,071
Always have been.

350
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:39,376
I love you, son.

351
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:54,360
I guess I zigged when I should've
zagged out there, huh?

352
00:25:01,315 --> 00:25:03,514
I sure wish your mother was here.

353
00:25:08,296 --> 00:25:09,377
She's coming.

354
00:25:10,418 --> 00:25:11,672
She'll be here.

355
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:14,663
Tell your mother I love her.

356
00:25:17,955 --> 00:25:20,952
I was... hard on you.

357
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:27,627
I pushed you... away.

358
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:35,544
I'm glad you... came... home.

359
00:25:42,645 --> 00:25:44,353
I'm proud of you.

360
00:27:20,926 --> 00:27:22,363
The big toast.

361
00:27:25,016 --> 00:27:26,789
Before I start,
is there anyone who...

362
00:27:26,962 --> 00:27:28,448
hasn't written me a speech?

363
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,736
It really makes me wonder
how screwed up you think I am

364
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:36,476
that I can't be trusted
to say a few things...

365
00:27:36,635 --> 00:27:37,773
about my brother.

366
00:27:41,636 --> 00:27:42,888
The thing is...

367
00:27:46,746 --> 00:27:48,483
these are all pretty lame.

368
00:27:49,507 --> 00:27:52,295
Not one of them mentions
my brother's musical theater phase

369
00:27:52,395 --> 00:27:54,094
when we all thought he was gay.

370
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,253
Seriously.

371
00:27:56,382 --> 00:27:59,053
You have not heard disturbing
until you've heard him singing

372
00:27:59,153 --> 00:28:01,997
"One Hand, One Heart"
in the shower every morning.

373
00:28:21,096 --> 00:28:22,582
I tease my brother a lot,
but...

374
00:28:22,832 --> 00:28:23,836
the truth is...

375
00:28:26,016 --> 00:28:27,931
the truth is I'm very proud of him.

376
00:28:29,889 --> 00:28:30,897
I'm...

377
00:28:32,106 --> 00:28:34,601
I'm proud of how kind he is...

378
00:28:37,109 --> 00:28:39,617
I'm proud of how giving he is,

379
00:28:40,908 --> 00:28:41,913
and...

380
00:28:43,475 --> 00:28:44,942
he's a very lucky man.

381
00:28:46,908 --> 00:28:47,922
Really.

382
00:29:06,783 --> 00:29:08,191
My father's dead.

383
00:29:15,123 --> 00:29:16,628
We'll get through.

384
00:29:50,746 --> 00:29:51,962
Get Gray back to town.

385
00:29:52,328 --> 00:29:53,621
What?
Wait a minute...

386
00:29:53,737 --> 00:29:56,025
Come tomorrow,
what's left of us will need a leader.

387
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:58,644
I think we've lost enough
in that department for one day.

388
00:29:58,933 --> 00:30:00,602
We're gonna need
every set of hands we can get.

389
00:30:00,718 --> 00:30:03,564
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're too important now, Gray.

390
00:30:04,413 --> 00:30:06,400
It's not negotiable.
Get him an escort.

391
00:30:06,814 --> 00:30:08,525
And start getting everyone
into position.

392
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:10,924
Who knows when
they're gonna come back again?

393
00:32:23,677 --> 00:32:24,682
Go ahead.

394
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,355
<i>So they got their reinforcements.

395
00:32:26,455 --> 00:32:27,884
<i>It's a couple hundred men.

396
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,854
<i>And another six of those
deuce and a halfs.

397
00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:33,694
<i>They're mobilizing now,
so I say you got about 15,

398
00:32:33,794 --> 00:32:36,019
<i>maybe 20 minutes
before they're on you.

399
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,470
You get back here as soon as you can.
All right?

400
00:32:41,722 --> 00:32:43,344
Say, what do you know about
a set of train tracks

401
00:32:43,444 --> 00:32:44,804
running alongside the river?

402
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:46,493
Why?
What do you see?

403
00:32:47,617 --> 00:32:49,286
<i>Hawkins, what's on the tracks?

404
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:50,816
I don't know. I can't see.

405
00:32:53,382 --> 00:32:54,964
- Hang on.
- Robert, disconnect it.

406
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:57,436
Jake, you got a very large train
coming from New Bern,

407
00:32:57,536 --> 00:32:59,051
<i>and they've got three cargo cars.

408
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:00,247
<i>What's in them?

409
00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:03,484
I think it's men,
and there's hundreds of them.

410
00:33:03,584 --> 00:33:05,579
It's a whole set of reinforcement...

411
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,263
Hawkins, what's going on?
Talk to me.

412
00:33:11,748 --> 00:33:12,906
<i>I'm on my way.

413
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:45,711
I've got to go.

414
00:33:46,328 --> 00:33:47,332
Wait.

415
00:33:47,506 --> 00:33:49,046
Look, they only had a few seconds.

416
00:33:49,146 --> 00:33:51,464
It wasn't enough time
to get an exact location.

417
00:33:51,635 --> 00:33:54,425
- We're fine for a little while.
- Where are you going?

418
00:33:55,795 --> 00:33:57,300
I have to stop a train.

419
00:34:00,698 --> 00:34:03,294
I-80 is secured
from Cheyenne to Grand Island.

420
00:34:03,394 --> 00:34:06,956
We now control the area
between Kearney and Hastings.

421
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:09,722
I-70 is turning out to be a challenge.

422
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:13,668
There are organized road gangs
controlling much of the interstate.

423
00:34:13,828 --> 00:34:16,481
I've also been told by a patient
in our medical unit

424
00:34:16,616 --> 00:34:20,019
to expect a significant skirmish
between two towns

425
00:34:20,347 --> 00:34:23,929
in northwest Kansas:
New Bern and Jericho.

426
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,105
<i>What is the location of those towns?

427
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:30,286
CZ-12, Quadrant Four.

428
00:34:30,386 --> 00:34:34,099
<i>We've tracked the terror suspect
to within 200 miles of that area.

429
00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:36,845
<i>Capture of this suspect
is a top priority

430
00:34:36,945 --> 00:34:39,017
<i>for President Tomarchio
and the administration.

431
00:34:39,117 --> 00:34:40,174
<i>Do you understand?

432
00:34:40,765 --> 00:34:43,384
- Should I re-prioritize, sir?
- <i>Immediately.

433
00:34:43,565 --> 00:34:46,028
Go to Jericho and crush the skirmish.

434
00:34:46,356 --> 00:34:47,827
Once the area's clear,

435
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:50,262
we will begin our search
for the terrorist.

436
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,822
I'm gonna ask Mimi to marry me.

437
00:35:10,706 --> 00:35:11,710
Yeah?

438
00:35:12,355 --> 00:35:14,137
Yeah. She can't cook,

439
00:35:14,252 --> 00:35:15,999
she's never seen nine innings
of baseball in her life,

440
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:17,336
she hates my clothes...

441
00:35:17,753 --> 00:35:18,775
but I love her.

442
00:35:19,412 --> 00:35:20,457
And I'm happy.

443
00:35:26,651 --> 00:35:28,433
Jake, I don't want to die today.

444
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:36,057
You're gonna make it out of here.

445
00:35:36,831 --> 00:35:38,304
That I promise.

446
00:35:51,998 --> 00:35:55,101
Constantino and those trucks
are right on your doorstep.

447
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:56,326
You don't have much time.

448
00:35:56,426 --> 00:35:57,509
What about that train?

449
00:35:57,609 --> 00:35:59,266
20 minutes, give or take.

450
00:36:00,749 --> 00:36:03,197
Tell me you have a plan,
a really good one.

451
00:36:07,104 --> 00:36:08,570
I need to borrow your tank.

452
00:36:13,737 --> 00:36:15,956
It won't fire.
I told you that, right?

453
00:36:16,189 --> 00:36:18,056
There's not a single
round of ammo in it.

454
00:36:18,332 --> 00:36:20,394
I'm not planning on shooting anything.

455
00:36:20,752 --> 00:36:22,258
The throttle's there on your left.

456
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:24,060
And to steer, you're just gonna...

457
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:26,445
Hey. This is not my first time.

458
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:39,484
Good luck out there.

459
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,099
You, too.

460
00:36:56,502 --> 00:36:57,856
Any minute now, huh?

461
00:37:07,562 --> 00:37:08,570
I'm...

462
00:37:17,211 --> 00:37:18,678
You know, he's here...

463
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,260
watching.

464
00:37:21,321 --> 00:37:22,768
You know that, right?

465
00:37:36,132 --> 00:37:38,395
They still doing
the bunny hop in there?

466
00:37:39,443 --> 00:37:40,916
I think it's the Macarena.

467
00:37:42,634 --> 00:37:43,753
The what?

468
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:47,975
Yeah, they're still doing the bunny hop.

469
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:53,589
Quite a speech you made in there.

470
00:37:56,071 --> 00:37:58,684
I had no idea you were
such a sentimental fool.

471
00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:02,295
Mom wrote it.
You think?

472
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:11,377
Listen, I know that you and Eric
aren't close and...

473
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:18,796
maybe you didn't feel like standing up
in front of a bunch of people and...

474
00:38:18,941 --> 00:38:20,334
acting like you were.

475
00:38:23,811 --> 00:38:26,438
Sometimes doing what you feel like doing

476
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:29,440
and doing what needs to be done
are two different things.

477
00:38:31,131 --> 00:38:33,567
You don't have to worry about me, Dad.
I'm fine.

478
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:38,135
I somehow get the feeling
my worrying days are far from over.

479
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,896
But they will be one day.

480
00:38:44,429 --> 00:38:48,306
One day, I know you're gonna become
the man I know you can be,

481
00:38:49,052 --> 00:38:50,598
the man you were born to be.

482
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,590
My God, that day's gonna be
something to see.

483
00:39:01,982 --> 00:39:03,287
Come on, Johnston.

484
00:39:03,473 --> 00:39:05,566
This scotch ain't gonna drink itself.

485
00:39:07,801 --> 00:39:10,349
Me and the old man are gonna
head down to the lake

486
00:39:10,638 --> 00:39:13,541
and share some 30-year-old single malt.
You want to come?

487
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:18,516
Yeah. I'm just gonna...

488
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:20,766
wait for Emily, say good night.

489
00:39:21,685 --> 00:39:22,707
I'll...

490
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:24,386
meet you there.

491
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,943
I'll save you a place.

492
00:39:31,645 --> 00:39:34,258
- Where's he going?
- Waiting for Emily, say good night.

493
00:39:35,488 --> 00:39:37,397
That's the last we'll see
of him tonight.

494
00:39:37,497 --> 00:39:38,497
Dad...

495
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,987
If I had a girl that looked like that,

496
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,611
I wouldn't keep her waiting.

497
00:39:43,612 --> 00:39:44,886
You hear that, boy?

498
00:39:45,251 --> 00:39:47,283
I'm gonna take that girl
away from you.

499
00:39:48,054 --> 00:39:49,447
You talk a good game.

500
00:39:49,547 --> 00:39:51,678
You better watch out
for yourself, too.

501
00:39:51,778 --> 00:39:53,357
Your wife is crazy about me.

502
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:56,904
Oh, my wife wants to take a hickory
switch to you three times a day.

503
00:39:59,253 --> 00:40:00,417
It's Constantino.

504
00:40:09,277 --> 00:40:10,397
I'm here.

505
00:40:10,497 --> 00:40:12,310
<i>My scouts just informed me.

506
00:40:13,169 --> 00:40:15,077
<i>I am sorry about your father.

507
00:40:18,903 --> 00:40:21,546
You're outmanned,
and you're outgunned.

508
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:24,727
There's too many of us and
we are too desperate to give up.

509
00:40:24,827 --> 00:40:26,160
You cannot win this.

510
00:40:27,438 --> 00:40:29,445
I'm giving you one last chance.

511
00:40:30,582 --> 00:40:31,449
<i>Walk away,
put your guns down...

512
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:32,742
Walk away,
put your guns down...

513
00:40:32,877 --> 00:40:34,099
and return to town,

514
00:40:34,395 --> 00:40:36,131
and no one else will be harmed.

515
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:41,756
Jake, I need an answer.
What's it gonna be?

516
00:40:45,781 --> 00:40:46,788
Nuts.

517
00:40:49,075 --> 00:40:50,483
Sorry, I didn't get that.

518
00:40:51,303 --> 00:40:53,146
You can go straight to hell.

519
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,535
About my father...

520
00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:03,615
you're the one I'm coming for.

521
00:41:10,108 --> 00:41:11,117
I want to go home.

522
00:41:11,271 --> 00:41:13,519
Our orders are to take people
out of the conflict zone.

523
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:15,163
You'll be safer in Cheyenne.

524
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:16,964
Colonel Hoffman?

525
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,969
What is all this?

526
00:41:19,069 --> 00:41:21,564
- Sir, wheels up in five minutes.
- Roger that.

527
00:41:21,842 --> 00:41:25,027
- Jericho's been moved up to priority #1
on the list.  - Thank you.

528
00:41:25,127 --> 00:41:26,326
Oh, God, thank you.

529
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:27,959
This is all thanks to you.

530
00:41:28,059 --> 00:41:30,736
Don't worry. We're gonna get things
back to normal again.

531
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:32,180
All right, saddle up.

532
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:02,926
My father expected us
to make a stand here.

533
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:08,215
To defend our home.

534
00:42:12,431 --> 00:42:13,934
That's what we're gonna do.

535
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:31,599
Smoke bombs!

536
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:32,934
Get in position!

537
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:41,487
Don't waste your rounds!

538
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:44,325
Wait for a clean shot!

539
00:42:50,313 --> 00:42:51,316
Wait...

540
00:43:05,322 --> 00:43:06,320
Wait...

541
00:43:11,124 --> 00:43:12,122
Wait...

542
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,074
Now!
