00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,320
Previously on jericho...

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,340
Jake green ! 

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,800
How you doing,man ? 

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,150
Wait a minute. Where the hell you been ? 

5
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,340
Around. 

6
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,650
Jake,no one's been around for five years. 

7
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,090
Seriously,where have you been ? 

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,230
Hey,brother. 

9
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,610
What you put this family through...

10
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,610
johnston,for god's sake. 

11
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:17,460
Now,he could have been...

12
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,780
we could spend a week talking about 
what I could have been,all right ? 

13
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,430
I've apologized,but I need my 
money to make a clean start. 

14
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,250
It's not your money. It's your 
grandfather's money. 

15
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,150
Stay one more day. 

16
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,700
Jake: I've got to get back to 
san diego by tomorrow. 

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,640
All right,it looks like the explosion 
came from the west,maybe denver. 

18
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:39,990
Did something happen ? 

19
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,010
Are we under attack ? 

20
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,700
Hi,dale. Sorry I didn't call 
sooner,angel,but we...

21
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,340
oh,my god ! 

22
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,800
Oh,my god ! 

23
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,560
sheriff ? 

24
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,850
Robert hawkins. 

25
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,050
I am so sorry. 

26
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,110
I didn't know your mother was in denver. 

27
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,580
She wasn't in denver. 

28
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,440
She was in atlanta. 

29
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,380
Oh,my god ! 

30
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,660
Look,I know you're telling people it was 
an accident,but if it was an attack,sheriff,

31
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,190
and there's chaos out there,you might not want 
the wrong people knowing that jericho is still here. 

32
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,980
It's the wrong bus ! 

33
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,760
Riley ! 

34
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,890
get april. We'll meet you at the medical center. 

35
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,920
There's an empty prison bus out there. 

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,950
What's your name ? 

37
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,390
Heather. 

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,510
Nice to meet you,jake. 

39
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,900
It's a great thing you did out there tonight. 

40
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,740
Thanks. 

41
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,990
Something happened in denver,atlanta,and it could be 
that we wake up and we find out that's where it stopped. 

42
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:33,780
But,until we know,are we going to use our 
imaginations to solve problems,or to cause them ? 

43
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,170
is there any sign of the sheriff,mr. Hawkins ? 

44
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,630
No,sir. 

45
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,480
I need to speak to your mayor. 

46
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,280
We got trouble coming. 

47
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,050
Oh,my god. 

48
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,470
Mom,where's april ? 

49
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,680
Jake,where have you been ? 

50
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,640
Where is she ? 

51
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,250
She's down the hall. 

52
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,450
What's going on ? 

53
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,370
Get dad on the radio. 

54
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,920
You'll be fairly mobile on it. 

55
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,550
How do you feel ? 

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,880
I feel like a badass. 

57
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,580
April,does the clinic have a fallout shelter ? 

58
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,120
Yes. What's going on ? 

59
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,730
It's bad. Come on. 

60
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,600
Jericho has two underground shelters,one right here 
under the town hall,the other under the medical clinic. 

61
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,410
What about basements and storm cellars ? 

62
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,240
They're better than nothing,but you've got 
to seal off the rest of the house with,uh...

63
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,100
duct tape,plastic sheeting,anything 
you can get your hands on. 

64
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,800
How do you know about radiation,mr. Hawkins ? 

65
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,950
Because I was a cop in saint louis and,
after 9-11,we got up to speed. 

66
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,170
So our biggest problem could be the rain. 

67
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,000
Won't the rain clear the radiation 
out of the air ? 

68
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,730
Yes,and bring it straight down on jericho...

69
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,630
a direct,concentrated hit. 
Anyone exposed too long...

70
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:53,980
mr. Mayor ? 

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,980
Sir ? 

72
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,810
All right,look. We're gonna 
divide the town in two. 

73
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,910
Everyone over here can go to the town hall shelter,
all those on the north side will go to the clinic. 

74
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,810
We'll get the word out,dad. 

75
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,090
How long before the radiation gets here ? 

76
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,600
Oh,I'm new here. 

77
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,390
This is your town. 

78
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,020
How long does it normally take 
a storm to get here from denver ? 

79
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,140
Less than two hours. 

80
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,090
Sounds right. 

81
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,830
Two hours ? 

82
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,260
We can't do that in two hours. 

83
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,740
Not enough time. 

84
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,220
We've got work to do,guys.

88
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,830
Jake and I used to play down 
here when we were kids. 

89
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,180
I don't think anyone's been 
down here in ten years. 

90
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,290
How many people can we fit in here ? 

91
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,730
300. 

92
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,780
You do know that there's almost 
5,000 people in this town. 

93
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,010
Eric ? 

94
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,380
Make sure all the people that 
have basements use them. 

95
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,110
We are not running out of room here today. 

96
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,810
You understand ?  Got it,dad. 

97
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,000
Jimmy !

100
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,200
When was the last time someone was in here ? 

101
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,570
You're kidding me. 

102
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,660
I can't put people in here. 

103
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,640
There's no air. 

104
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,540
There's no air in here. 

105
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,890
I hope the fan works. 

106
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,330
We got a lot of work to do. 

107
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,410
Wait,wait ! 

108
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh,thank god. 

109
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,780
I haven't seen anybody for hours. 

110
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,930
I ran out of gas. 

111
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,780
There's dead birds all over the road. 

112
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,580
Yeah,we saw them,too. 

113
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,170
They must have flown through the radiation. 

114
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,520
What radiation ? 

115
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,750
There was a mushroom cloud. Somebody nuked us. 

116
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,050
Oh,my god. 

117
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,950
Look,miss,we're running low on gas. 

118
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,560
Do you know if there's a gas station nearby ? 

119
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,860
Well,what do you think it is ? 

120
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,820
Do you think it's an accident or...

121
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,010
Ma'am,we don't know yet. 

122
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,150
Okay. 

123
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,560
Did it come from wichita,because 
my fiance,he's flying in from...

124
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,340
no,no. Wrong direction. 

125
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,570
It looked more like denver. 

126
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,860
Look,we need gas. 

127
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,210
Do you know if there is a gas station nearby ? 

128
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,950
yeah. 

129
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,770
No. 

130
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,950
No,the pumps are...

131
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,620
they don't work. 

132
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,520
They've all been abandoned. 

133
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,640
No,we could...we could try the richmond ranch. 

134
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,220
I think they might have gas there. 

135
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,100
Then get in. We'll take you there. 

136
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,600
Miss ? 

137
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,420
It's okay. 

138
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,090
Get in. 

139
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,970
Dale ? 

140
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,790
Wake up. 

141
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,430
Wake up,angel. 

142
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,920
Mom ? 

143
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,990
Don't you remember what happened last night ? 

144
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,310
Your mom's gone. 

145
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,310
gracie ? 

146
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,830
Come on,gracie ! Open up ! 

147
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,790
Gracie,we need to stock the shelters with food ! 

148
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,630
Attention ! 

149
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,800
Attention ! 

150
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,500
There is radioactive fallout coming 
from the nuclear blast. 

151
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,870
You have less than 90 minutes to get indoors. 

152
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:28,580
I repeat,you have less than 
90 minutes to get indoors. 

153
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,220
Use your basements. 

154
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,710
Use duct tape or other tape to seal your home. 

155
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,390
You have less than 90 minutes. 

156
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,500
You can go to the shelter at town hall 
or the shelter at the medical center. 

157
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,150
There is radioactive fallout coming. 

158
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,760
You have 90 minutes to get yourselves indoors. 

159
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,660
We are indoors ! 

160
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,790
you're not from around here,are you ? 

161
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:57,380
I came from D. C.  To supervise 
a little audit on a farm. 

162
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,410
Is god punishing me ? 

163
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,130
Look,you really should get to 
the basement at town hall. 

164
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,700
You think ? 

165
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,590
Jake,I'm not going anywhere. 

166
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,170
Mom...

167
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,540
mom,I'm not going to argue with you. 

168
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,990
Go to the other shelter. 

169
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,780
I'm staying. 

170
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,220
Mom,I don't even know if we can fix it,
and I can't concentrate knowing you're here. 

171
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,120
Please,I'll be fine. 

172
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,810
I'll be fine. 

173
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,370
Promise me you'll come to the 
shelter after it's fixed. 

174
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,610
Promise me. 

175
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,730
I promise,mom. 

176
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,880
I want my boys with me. 

177
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,060
Okay,go. 

178
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,760
Please. 

179
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,340
Frank ! 

180
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,540
Quit messing with the tv. 

181
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,960
I don't want to waste my generator on static. 

182
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,560
Mary,what are these people still doing here ? 

183
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,090
They won't go. 

184
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,180
I can't leave these clowns in my bar. 

185
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,870
All right,listen up. 

186
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,830
Radiation's on its way from denver. 

187
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,720
If you don't have a basement,
you need to get to town hall. 

188
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,890
There's a shelter therE. 

189
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,630
I'm not going to town hall. 

190
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,980
Well,you don't have a choice,people. 

191
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,760
You're being evacuated. 

192
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,610
And who are you ? 

193
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,070
I'm the deputy mayor. 

194
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,900
What,did your daddy make you a deputy ? 

195
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,310
Just forget it,eric,you've told everybody. 

196
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,000
Do you realize a nuclear bomb went off yesterday ? 

197
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,240
So ? 

198
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,100
If I'm going to die in a nuclear blast,so be it. 

199
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,420
I'm going to be right here,
playing pool with my buddies. 

200
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,730
But you're not going to die in a blast. 

201
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,160
You're going to get radiation poisoning. 

202
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:57,370
Within the first couple of hours you're going 
to be vomiting and have crippling diarrhea. 

203
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,820
Your hair is going to fall out in chunks. 

204
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,310
Your skin,it's going to blister. 

205
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,960
Your internal organs are going to start to shut down. 

206
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,830
Because,well,frankly...

207
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,080
they're being cooked from the inside. 

208
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:17,770
You're going to get sicker and 
sicker until you can't move. 

209
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,470
And then you will die. 

210
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,610
Over there on the floor by the pool table...

211
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,030
with your buddies. 

212
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,070
Don't mind me. 

213
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,270
sit tight. 

214
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,950
We'll be right back. 

215
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,170
Sheriff,come in. Come in,sheriff,over. 

216
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,610
Randall,no one's heard from 
the sheriff since last night. 

217
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,260
There was a prison bus out there. 

218
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,380
I think we better assume the worst. 

219
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,600
You're on your own. 

220
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,650
What about jimmy or bill ? 

221
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,720
Deputies are missing,too. 

222
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,250
You're just going to have to handle this yourself. 

223
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,520
Don't think we forgot you,did you ? 

224
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,010
Anything wrong,miss ? 

225
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,480
No,nothing. 

226
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,830
Doesn't look like anybody's here. 

227
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,120
Yeah,well,the pump's locked,so...

228
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,750
you know,there is this other place 
that I can take you to. 

229
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,240
Look,we're running on fumes as it is. 

230
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,460
Make a sound,you die. 

231
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,170
I'm sorry,sir,I don't think anybody's home. 

232
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,530
Ms. Sullivan...

233
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,530
what a surprise. 

234
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,980
Hey,bonnie. 

235
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:59,040
Oxygen tanks,ivs,all non-electrical medical supplies. 

236
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,280
When was that written ? 

237
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,760
1957. 

238
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,160
The population of jericho was 1,000 people. 

239
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,390
I'll start moving everyone. 

240
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,540
I'll get the ventilation system fixed. 

241
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,540
god,they chewed through everything. 

242
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,160
Mind if I pitch in ? 

243
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,890
You know how to strip wires ? 

244
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,240
Ever since junior high. 

245
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,410
Yeah,I was that popular. 

246
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,800
All right,great. 

247
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,900
Check the fan belt,I think it's frayed. 

248
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,010
Well,then you might want to get another one. 

249
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,540
Any mid-century american car would be a good match. 

250
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,580
And check the brushers. 

251
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,590
We don't want the motor to seize up. 

252
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,290
Okay. 

253
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,640
All right. 

254
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,400
You take over. 

255
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,140
I'll look for a fan belt. 

256
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,120
Excuse me,sir. 

257
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,150
You're doing that wrong. 

258
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,530
April. 

259
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,390
She thinks we shouldn't move the baby. 

260
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,170
Ma'am,your baby's protected in this little bubble. 

261
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,830
She's got fresh air and food. 

262
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,570
Right now,she's the safest person in jericho,but you're not. 

263
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:09,680
We need to make sure she has a mother to take care of her when this thing is over,okay ? 

264
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,210
Please. 

265
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,780
Please,let us take you both down 
to the shelter,okay ? 

266
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,110
Okay. 

267
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:22,500
Bobby. 

268
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,330
Jake green ? 

269
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,110
Just a second,ma'am. 

270
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,050
Bobby,there's two in the nursery. 
-I'm emily sullivan's aunt. 

271
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,180
Taken to the shelter in our basement. 

272
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,770
Mrs. Dawson,hi. 

273
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,410
Have you seen emily ? 

274
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,410
No,not since yesterday. 

275
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,090
Maybe she's at the other shelter. 

276
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,240
No one over there has seen her,
and she's not at her house. 

277
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,120
I heard you were back in town,and I figured 
the one person who would know...

278
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,490
I'm sorry. 

279
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,320
I have to go. 

280
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,820
If i see her,I'll tell her you're 
looking for her,but I'm sure she's fine. 

281
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:03,090
o we'll just,uh,use your pump 
and be on our way. 

282
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,050
Stanley has the key. 

283
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,890
What did she just say ? 

284
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,340
her brother,stanley,he's got the key to the pump. 

285
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,720
Wait a minute,she's deaf ? 

286
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,500
Yes. 

287
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,650
I read lips. 

288
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,930
When do you think stanley gets back ? 

289
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,180
Another hour. 

290
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,960
What did she just say ? 

291
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,690
It's going to be about an hour. 

292
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,200
Oh,we can wait an hour,can't we ? 

293
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,950
Ms. Sullivan,you all right ? 

294
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,270
Yeah,fine. 

295
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,020
I'm just hungry. 

296
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:49,350
why don't we make some food for the officers ? 

297
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,470
Oh,I want eggs. 

298
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,200
It's a farmhouse,you've got eggs,right ? 

299
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,620
Yeah,why don't we,uh...

300
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,040
why don't we all go make something to eat ? 

301
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,880
Sure. 

302
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,710
People south of main go to you at town hall ? 

303
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,230
Yeah,that's right,all those to the north 
of main street go to the medical center. 

304
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,380
Johnston. 

305
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,070
Right,yeah,I know,you want me to take it easy. 

306
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,040
I'm just going to go help eric 
get the supplies from gracie. 

307
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,360
I've already sent people to do that. 

308
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,160
Gail,who is in charge here,you or me ? 

309
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,220
You do not want to play that game. 

310
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,890
Here's every book we have in the 
library about nuclear radiation. 

311
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,190
Our friend the atom. 

312
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,670
Some friend. 

313
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,890
Anything in here for grownups ? 

314
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,750
I'd like to know what we're supposed 
to do if this town gets hit. 

315
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,940
None of the books are specific. 

316
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,370
Atom bombs have only gone off in 
populated cities twice in history. 

317
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,090
And denver was probably hit 
by a hydrogen bomb,anyway. 

318
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,390
What's the difference ? 

319
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,810
Hydrogen bombs,they literally explode the air. 

320
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:58,740
So,what you're saying is that 
nobody knows what's really coming ? 

321
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,210
Then we pick worst case scenario. 

322
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,470
What needs to be done ? 

323
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,930
One second,sir,I have that. 

324
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,710
Let me just...

325
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,910
anything left outside will have to be scrubbed down. 

326
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:16,280
And if it rains,the top 18 inches or so of soil 
will have to be removed before planting again. 

327
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,020
And tell everybody to cover all the water wells. 

328
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,890
That's about what it says,right ? 

329
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:24,640
Yes. 

330
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,740
Yes,that's right. 

331
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,750
Well,you heard the man. 

332
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,370
Jeff,let's make sure all the 
ranchers get the livestock inside. 

333
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,710
I'm going to work on the radio. 

334
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,330
This may be our last chance 
to make contact for a while. 

335
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,500
There's a bunch of people in the church. 

336
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,570
They held a vigil there all night. 

337
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,850
I'm going to make sure they get into shelter. 

338
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,720
Hurry back. 

339
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,060
Yes,ma'am. 

340
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,210
I'm telling you they need to be replaced. 

341
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:51,920
Listen,girlie...

342
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,220
please,don't argue with me. -Don't tell me...

343
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,630
the brushers are shot,it's revving too high. 

344
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,360
turn them off ! 

345
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,290
Jake,everyone's ready. 

346
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,210
What do we do now ? 

347
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,670
Don't let them in here ! 

348
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,360
The rain's going to be here soon. 

349
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,120
People are getting scared. 

350
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,820
Do we have air or not ? 

351
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,490
You seal them up in here,they're going to die. 

352
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,300
Dad,can you hear me ? 

353
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,460
Dad's checking on the church. 

354
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,940
Jake,what do you need ? 

355
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,480
Our shelter's no good. 

356
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,080
I'm bringing these people to town hall. 

357
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,160
Whoa,whoa,hold on. 

358
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,870
Jake,I don't know how many more people we can hold. 

359
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,900
What about the basement ? 

360
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,400
They don't have basements,eric. 

361
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,070
That's why they came here. 

362
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,510
Eric,we've got 200 people here. 

363
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,750
Some of them need medical attention. 

364
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,150
Handle it. 

365
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,510
Look,I will be at town hall soon. 

366
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,380
I'll check to see how much room we have. 

367
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,610
And I will call you back. 

368
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,830
I don't have time; we're coming. 

369
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,270
Sorry,my husband needs a kick sometimes. 

370
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,250
You don't have to apologize to me. 

371
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,210
I've got to go to the shelter. 

372
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,020
Bring everything you can. 

373
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,590
H-how much more do you need ? 

374
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,890
Enough to feed half the town,gracie. 

375
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,310
Half the town ? 

376
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,550
Wait--

377
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,090
skylar,you have to come to the shelter. 

378
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,870
I'm not going to some stupid shelter. 

379
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,670
I'm going home to wait for my parents. 

380
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,350
Don't be crazy. 

381
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,530
I'm not crazy ! I'm going home. 

382
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,860
Fine. -Excuse me,ladies. 

383
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,160
Are you going to pay for those ? 

384
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,930
What are you talking about ? 

385
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,780
Everybody is just taking stuff. 

386
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,130
This is still my store. 

387
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,620
Is that for an emergency ? 

388
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,870
All right,you know what ? 

389
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,690
Fine,keep it. 

390
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,550
Her parents are in new york,okay ? 

391
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:58,770
Who knows if they're even going to come back. 

392
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,780
It was just a couple cans of soda. 

393
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,830
They're my soda. 

394
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,540
I say we head east. 

395
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,910
She was headed east,wasn't she ? 

396
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,390
Hey,how far from here would you say those crows were ? 

397
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,950
About five miles west from where you picked me up. 

398
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,280
Hell,then we'll go north. 

399
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,340
You want to help me out with the coffee ? 

400
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,180
Yeah,I'll show you where it is. 

401
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,080
You better get down to that shelter. 

402
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,950
The wind is moving faster than we thought. 

403
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,760
I'm watching it. 

404
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,160
Just get everybody underground. 

405
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:12,670
You know,if you get that thing to work,just do me 
a favor,and find out who did this to us. 

406
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,440
eric,come in. 

407
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,820
This is eric,go ahead. 

408
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,880
A couple of busloads coming to town hall. 

409
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,440
People,please ! 

410
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,520
Don't get off the bus. 

411
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,760
We can't take any more. 

412
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,680
Eric,what the hell are you doing ? 

413
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,680
They can't come in here,jake. 

414
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,730
What do you mean they can't come in here ? 

415
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:00,490
We're packed ! -What ? 

416
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,760
I got a whole bus full of people here that need shelter. 

417
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:05,200
You're really gonna turn away all these people,eric ? 

418
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,160
You're going to turn away your wife ? 

419
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,900
We let everybody in,we'll all suffocate. 

420
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:13,570
Eric,there are really sick people here,and the storm is coming ! 

421
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,530
Okay,we can take ten. 

422
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,840
And I saved a spot for you. 

423
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,340
All right,the ten most critical,fast. 

424
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,020
Gray,the salt mine,how many people will it hold ? 

425
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,570
As many as you want,but I don't think...

426
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,340
it has a ventilation system,right ? 

427
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,910
Yeah,and water. 

428
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,570
All right,it's the best option we have right now,all right ? 

429
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,290
Mom ? 

430
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,650
Have you seen your father ? 

431
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,960
He told me he was going to the church. 

432
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,570
Well,gail,people from that church got back 20 minutes ago. 

433
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,180
Eric ? 

434
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,470
Mom,we'll find dad. 

435
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,420
Jake,take your people to the mine. 

436
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,180
Leave us 10. 

437
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,940
I'll go with you,jake. 

438
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,130
After 27 years,nobody knows that mine the way I do. 

439
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,520
I guess you can fit 11 people now. 

440
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,860
Yeah,make it 12. 

441
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,890
It's my place...I should be there. 

442
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,110
Yeah,let's go. 

443
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,900
We're going to be okay. 

444
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,260
Hang on. 

445
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,180
That smells good. 

446
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,290
Oh,no,no,I'll get it. 

447
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,670
I am so sorry. 

448
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,600
Damn it. 

449
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,080
Oh,that looks bad. 

450
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,810
Look,go in the kitchen right now and run cold water over it. 

451
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,000
It'll stop it before the blisters. 

452
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,110
I'll clean up this mess. 

453
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,740
what happened ? -She...

454
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,250
I burnt my hand. 

455
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,630
You left her alone ? 

456
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,710
She's fine. 

457
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,260
Is he okay ? 

458
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,210
He'll live. 

459
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,340
I can only get 12 down on the elevator at a time ! 

460
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,020
That's the best I can do ! 

461
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,200
Shep,we have to seal the entrance. 

462
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,140
There's no door,jake. 

463
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,980
Well,we can't just let the rain pour down the shaft. 

464
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,010
These people won't be safe. 

465
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,830
We won't be safe. 

466
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,570
Well,how do we seal it ? 

467
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,540
I don't know,but it's a mine. 

468
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,160
You got dynamite,right ? 

469
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,100
we put charges here,here,here...

470
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:49,780
gray: Are you crazy ? 

471
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:53,030
How do we know we won't bring the whole thing down on top of us ? 

472
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,430
We don'T. 

473
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,780
I am going to the little girls' room. 

474
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,730
Hey,where is that ? 

475
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,230
Right up the stairs. 

476
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,740
Right there,see ? 

477
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,240
Good to know. 

478
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,300
Straight back ! 

479
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,880
Eric,any sign of dad ? 

480
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,150
No,not yet. 

481
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,560
Checked the church,main street. 

482
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,890
We're going through every inch of town hall right now. 

483
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,060
Listen,eric,I'm going to need you to bring a 
crew over here and dig us out when this thing's over. 

484
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,760
What ? What ?  Why ? 

485
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,100
We're ready,jake ! 

486
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,790
Are you crazy ? 

487
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:35,100
Just dig us out...and find dad,okay ? 

488
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,310
Let's go. 

489
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,470
mr. Hawkins,did my father come through here ? 

490
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,510
No,I haven't seen him. 

491
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,900
Mom,check the offices again. 

492
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,080
Maybe we missed something. 

493
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,830
I'll go check out the parking lot. 

494
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,840
Look,we'll find him,okay ? 

495
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:23,410
Okay. 

496
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,770
Be careful. 

497
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,960
We'll find him. 

498
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,280
Could you use some help,ma'am ? 

499
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,950
No,we need you on the radio. 

500
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,340
You know,I can't get this old thing to work. 

501
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,440
Okay,come. -Fine. 

502
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,130
Please. 

503
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,440
you are not in my house. 

504
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,350
Get off my property,right now. 

505
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,560
And my property goes all the way down the hill. 

506
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,880
You need to get back to town. 

507
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,510
The radiation's coming from denver. 

508
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,860
I'm not leaving here. 

509
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,750
My parents are on their way back. 

510
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,840
You talked to them ? 

511
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,690
No,freak,the phones are dead. 

512
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,700
But I'm not leaving here without them. 

513
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:39,790
All right,stay inside,tape up the windows,and don't use the water. 

514
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,620
Don't tell me what to do. 

515
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,430
I'm serious,skylar. 

516
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,090
Stay inside. 

517
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:52,820
Dale ? 

518
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,610
Dale,stop ! 

519
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,490
Please. 

520
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,400
Stay here. 

521
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,140
It's not safe out there. 

522
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,850
Please stay here. 

523
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,160
Jody,where you at ? 

524
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,100
All right,everybody...

Take some of that out,all right ? 

527
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,140
Seal the entrance,not cause a cave-in. 

528
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,330
Where'd you learn how to do that ? 

529
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,200
I knew a guy once. 

530
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,000
Did you blow him up ? 

531
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,930

532
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,600
Is anyone here ? 

533
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,830
How does that look ? 

534
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,620
It's good,that'll do. 

535
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,320
How we coming,gray ? 

536
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,880
This is the last of 'em. 

537
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,230

Can you hear me ? Is there anybody there ? 

543
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,100

Everybody be quiet ! 

548
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,080
There are men here with guns. 

549
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,290
I think they might have killed the sheriff. 

550
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,440
Hello ? 

551
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,290

571

No. 

598
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,970
We just want gas. 

599
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,440
Supplies,that's all this is about. 

600
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,450
It's just about fuel. 

601
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,830
Let her go. 

602
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,450

Sit down.

Here,sit him down. 

613
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,670
I just found him on the floor in his office. 

614
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,050
Did you hit your head ? 

615
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,290
All right. 

616
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,850

You hate camping. 

637
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,890
