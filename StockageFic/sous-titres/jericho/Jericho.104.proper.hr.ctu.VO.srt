1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
Previously on jericho all right,it looks 
like the explosion came from the west,maybe denver. 

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:01,790
Are we under attack ? 

3
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:02,590
This could've been a test. 

4
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,990
Could've been an accident. 

5
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:08,330
Look,I know you're telling people it was 
an accident,but if it was an attack,sheriff,

6
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,800
and there's chaos out there,you might not want the 
wrong people knowing that jericho is still here. 

7
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,410
Dale turner's mother died 
tonight in another explosion. 

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,550
Atlanta. 

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,240
Oh,my god. 

10
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,940
Won't the rain clear the radiation out of the air ? 

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,930
Yes,and bring it straight down on jericho. 

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,580
A direct,concentrated hit. 

13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,590
Anyone exposed too long...

14
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,510
how do you know about radiation,mr. Hawkins ? 

15
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,090
Stanley. 

16
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,500
No,hey ! 

17
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,520
Stanley,don't touch her. 

18
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,500
How do you know the rain's radioactive ? 

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,740
Denver's pretty far away. 

20
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,260
Well,we don't know how many bombs there were. 

21
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,660
oh,my god. 

22
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,800
We got something ! 

23
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,320
Are they just reporting it or are they behind it ? 

24
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,550
Maybe we're being invaded. 

25
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,100
If this country is at war,we need to know it. 

26
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,610
More than electricity or food,
this town needs information. 

27
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:57,890
We can't just sit here in the dark. 

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,820
He's right. 

29
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,290
Makes us too vulnerable. 

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,230
We could organize a group of people,
send them out in every direction. 

31
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,760
The four horsemen of the apocalypse. 

32
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,270
Let's hope not. 

33
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:12,050
4 days after the bombs

34
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:18,240
1 day after the fallout has cleared

35
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,680
I'm telling you,it's the midwest. 

36
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,940
From the skyline,I'm thinking cincinnati. 

37
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,050
I wish we could read the license plates. 

38
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,490
let's make cincinnati a question mark. 

39
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,130
Jake. 

40
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,700
Hey,stanley. 
Hey,bonnie. 

41
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,990
Anything new ? 

42
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,920
No,not since yesterday. 

43
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,860
Shep and gray should have been back by now. 

44
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,040
Our radios went silent about 50 miles out. 

45
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,170
God,it makes you wonder what 
happened to whoever shot this. 

46
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,420
I think that might have been 
the last thing they ever saw. 

47
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,520
the generator's running out of gas. 

48
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,550
We're going to lose the tv. 

49
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,950
I'll take care of it. 

50
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,120
How can you ? 

51
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,220
Gas pumps don't work at the 
station with the power down. 

52
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,820
Look,I don't want you to worry. 

53
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,360
Sorry,folks. 

54
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,720
We're closing early tonight. 

55
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,400
Take a flashlight,it's dark out there. 

56
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,780
What ? It's only 9:30. 

57
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,440
You heard her,let's move it,folks. 

58
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,740
Time to go home. 

59
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,360
Let's move it out. 

60
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,580
Is the generator out ? 

61
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,480
No,out of booze. 

62
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,510
any more images ? 

63
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,170
No,just the same loop. 

64
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,150
Come on,I'll walk you home. 

65
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,580
Where do you live ? 

66
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,670
That way. 

67
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,320
So is it weird being home after so long ? 

68
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,680
A little bit. 

69
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,430
I still can't get used to bailey's 
without the mechanical bull. 

70
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,960
Stanley must have cried when they took that out. 

71
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,820
He had the record. 

72
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,470
When did the pizza garden 
become the cyberjolt cafe ? 

73
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,370
Oh,when the health department 
shut down the pizza garden. 

74
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,060
What ?  ! 

75
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,650
Oh,don't tell me you liked the pizza garden. 

76
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,270
I used to work there washing dishes. 

77
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,520
Oh,you must not have done a very good job. 

78
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,510
that came from the alley. 

79
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,080
It's the pharmacy. 

80
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,420
Why don't you go get some help ? 

81
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,390
help...

82
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,260
sync:fisherchen, hoodman

83
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:24,150
YDY proudly presents

84
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,780
Jake. 

85
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,250
Who is he ? 

86
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,940
I don't know. 

87
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,040
Help me get him out of here. 

88
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,750
Not without gloves or a hazmat suit. 

89
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,210
We got to get him to a doctor,now. 

90
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,490
is that radiation sickness ? 

91
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,800
I think it might be. 

92
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,030
Heather,heather. 

93
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,270
Get her out. 
Okay. 

94
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,290
Let's go. 

95
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,660
Come on,bill,let's go. 

96
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,330
Help us pick him up. 
I'm not touching him. 

97
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,360
No way. Not me. He could be contagious. 

98
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,730
He's not contagious,bill. 

99
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,070
I'm sorry,stanley. 

100
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,720
What if it was me lying here,bill ? 
Would you walk away then ? 

101
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,970
We could get sick touching that guy. 

102
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,830
It's not like with you,stanley. 

103
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,960
We don't even know who this guy is. 

104
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,220
I just stopped by bailey's to check on the tv signal. 

105
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,860
Can't you cut your husband some slack ? 

106
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,970
And that took three hours ? 

107
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,650
I was only there for,like,an hour. 

108
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,660
We're in a state of emergency,eric. 

109
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,430
I'm aware of that,april. 

110
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,170
Dr. Peterson's gone to kansas city 
to look for his daughter. 

111
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,760
And dr. Hoder's worked the last 24 hours. 
Well,I am here now. 

112
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,460
What do you want from me ? 
And you...decided to go have a beer. 

113
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,920
I've got a baby on a ventilator and 
the generator is almost out of gas. 

114
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,360
Well,don't you have a hand pump ? 

115
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,830
Who'd pump it ? 

116
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,970
Out of the way. 

117
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,350
Out of the way ! 

118
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,100
April,he's having trouble breathing. 

119
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,100
Get him in room three. 

120
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,970
who is that ? 

121
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,840
Who's in there ? 

122
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,330
Hello ? 

123
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,860
Who is that ? 

124
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,380
it's just me,mrs. Leigh. 

125
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,850
Oh,dale. 

126
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,440
What are you up to ? You scared me to death. 

127
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,900
It was supposed to be a surprise. 

128
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,510
What ? 

129
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,810
where did you get all this ? 

130
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,340
The train that never showed up. 

131
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,100
It smashed into a car. 

132
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,900
There's a ton of food just sitting on it. 

133
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,880
It's just about five miles outside of town. 

134
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,630
Well,we can't just take it,it's not ours. 

135
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,680
Not all of it,anyway. 

136
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,680
The town took your food. 

137
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,400
Well,it was an emergency. 

138
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,710
And so is this. 

139
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,690
The hell with them. 

140
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,320
Who is this man ? 

141
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,240
Anyone recognize him ? 

142
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,520
Not so far. 

143
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,980
Those burns...

144
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,400
does that mean that he was close to the blast ? 

145
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,090
Why'd he come to jericho ? 

146
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,450
It's a hell of a way from denver. 

147
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,550
Maybe he's related to someone in town. 

148
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,100
Then why'd he break into the pharmacy ? 

149
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:41,700
any I. D.  ? 

150
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,350
No,just some keys. 

151
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,640
He doesn't even have a wallet. 

152
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,820
is he going to be okay ? 

153
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,280
Depends on the dose that he got. 

154
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,670
son,you and stanley should go wash up. 

155
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,250
Those clothes might still be contaminated. 

156
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,110
There's a shower down the hall. 

157
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,070
dad. 

158
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,740
We got another situation. 

159
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,650
There's not much more gas in the generator here. 

160
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,440
Bailey's tavern went dark tonight. 

161
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:30,630
That was the only satellite dish in town getting 
a signal,our only link to the outside world. 

162
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,790
you okay ? 

163
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,850
Yeah. 

164
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:36,190
We're going to have to get people 
to siphon gas out of their cars. 

165
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,010
What if more come ? 

166
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,390
There's not enough gas to keep the 
clinics going for all of them. 

167
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,070
You saying we ought to turn them away ? 

168
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,780
No,I'm saying we have limited resources. 

169
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,010
Well,for right now,let's just 
get as much gas as we can. 

170
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,550
Some of the nurses are spooked. 

171
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,440
They're worried about contamination. 

172
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,220
Honey,I'll do anything I can to help you. 

173
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:01,800
If you could,keep an eye on this baby,
then I could see to the other patients. 

174
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,380
Sure. 

175
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,580
I hope to god the power doesn't go. 

176
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,140
Look,we'll do everything we can,until we can't. 

177
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,390
menphis

178
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,150
dad,it's sam. 

179
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,880
vacations

180
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,830
dad,I'm thirsty,are you in there ? 

181
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,710
Any word from shep or gray ? 

182
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,600
No,mayor. 

183
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,100
Still can't get 'em on the radio. 

184
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,550
Maybe they got captured by those tanks stanley saw. 

185
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,980
Those tanks are probably just national guard okay ? 

186
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,700
So...you don't know that. 

187
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,640
They could be...shh. 

188
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,690
They could be china,they could be iran. 

189
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,960
Al qaeda,north korea...anybody who hates us. 

190
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,650
They could be coming here and 
what's our line of defense ? 

191
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,670
You're looking at it. 

192
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,430
Jake ? 

193
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,540
Had to take a shower. 

194
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,200
Go ahead. 

195
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,360
No,i I did; I just took a shower. 

196
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,030
Oh,right. 

197
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,070
So what's up ? 

198
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,350
I...

199
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,730
April said that the medical center was 
running low on gasoline for the generator,

200
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,560
and it occurred to me that if we had a length of 
hose and a funnel,we could siphon gas out of our cars. 

201
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,670
Then it occurred to me there's all that gas 
in the tanks at murthy's gas station

202
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,430
and if we could get enough suction 
we could get all the gas we wanted...

203
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,180
would a water pump do it ? 

204
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,870
Bonnie. 

205
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,270
This could be my brother. 

206
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,860
Is this how they die ? 

207
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,730
No. Stanley didn't get it this bad. 

208
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,400
He could still got cancer. 

209
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,430
No,we don't know that. 

210
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,190
Listen. 

211
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,610
Don't worry about me,I'll be fine. 

212
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,630
Take care of him. 

213
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,300
I'm going to have to put him on a 
ventilator,it'll use up power but...

214
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,370
but the baby has the better chance for 
survival,save the generator for the baby. 

215
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,530
Hey,hey,hey,what about him ? 

216
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,240
Give him something for the pain. 

217
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,060
Keep him comfortable. 

218
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,330
Sit back and watch him die. 

219
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,710
Well,I don't like it,jake,but that's the 
most rational option we have right now. 

220
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,130
Unless you can think of something better. 

221
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,340
Will your generator last until morning ? 

222
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,660
I think so. 

223
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,280
All right,give me until then. 

224
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,590
can you tell me your name ? 

225
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,400
victor. 

226
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,220
Miller. 

227
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,980
Victor. 

228
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,200
Victor,you're in a medical clinic. 

229
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,030
Okay,we're going to take care of you. 

230
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,630
No,no. 

231
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,030
They're coming. 

232
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,180
They're coming. 

233
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,420
So how long do you think he'll be unconscious ? 

234
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,280
Could be a long time. 

235
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,620
If he ever wakes up again. 

236
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,360
Who are "they" ? 

237
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,720
Who's coming ? 

238
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,680
Well,maybe he saw passengers 
from one of those planes. 

239
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,330
He could've meant terrorists. 

240
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,290
Unless he wakes up,we don't know 
what kind of danger were in. 

241
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,430
For right now,hire as many deputies 
as you can,use them to help you get gas. 

242
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,990
Clinic's running low. 

243
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,240
But it's not my gas,it belongs to noraco. 

244
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,680
It's no use to anyone,mr. Murthy. 

245
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,680
Without electricity,the pumps don't even work. 

246
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,960
And we'll leave you an I. O. U. For the 500 gallons. 

247
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,090
I could be fired. 

248
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,630
With all due respect,who's going to fire you ? 

249
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,420
It's a different world now,mr. Murthy. 

250
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,560
All right,let's get them open. 

251
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,160
Stanley will be here any second. 

252
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,300
They're never coming back. 

253
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,740
The district manager,any of them. 

254
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,990
Are they ? 

255
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,290
No. 

256
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:09,440
Shortly after my mother died,
my husband was transferred to st. Louis. 

257
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,170
It was hard to leave memphis,
because it was our home. 

258
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,280
But eventually we learned to love it. 

259
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,380
How did your mother die ? 

260
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:21,070
M. S. 

261
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,500
Aly,what area of st. Louis are we from ? 

262
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,750
Kirkwood. 
Which is where ? 

263
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:26,820
Near powder valley. 

264
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,880
Lots of hiking,trails and nature. 

265
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,900
We love to hike. 

266
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,620
Sam,where'd you go to school ? 

267
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,020
The crow school. 

268
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
Crow island school. 

269
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,660
God,we've gone over this so many times. 

270
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,610
And we'll go over it again and again,
until we get it right. 

271
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,600
Mom...

272
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,730
you know what,I can't keep doing this. 

273
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,880
Keep samuel inside. 

274
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,290
I've got my story. 

275
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,420
We lived in a two-bedroom house,we drove 
a green volvo,we had a stay-at-home mom,

276
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,250
which is bull,because she worked all 
the time because our dad was never around. 

277
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,080
upstairs. Go on. 

278
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,990
You got a minute ? 

279
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,800
Of course. 

280
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,320
You probably heard the,uh,sheriff's been killed,
along with three more of our men. 

281
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,770
I heard. 

282
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,870
I'm sorry for your loss. 

283
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,080
Thank you. 

284
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,160
Well,we're down to just me and bill,and 
neither of us is trained for a national emergency. 

285
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,790
I don't think anyone is prepared for this. 

286
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,620
We need a few more deputies. 

287
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,960
And I thought since you were 
a cop in st. Louis and all...

288
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,740
no. 

289
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,710
It's a very flattering offer,but 
I'm still settling my family. 

290
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,940
It'd just be for the time being. 

291
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,060
Look,mr. Hawkins,people are on edge. 

292
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,860
All right,we've got break-ins and kids vandalizing. 

293
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,720
We just need some more manpower to show people 
there's still law and order in this town. 

294
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,520
All right. 

295
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,190
When do I start ? 

296
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,470
You're already on the clock. 

297
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,950
We're asking everyone in town 
to donate five gallons of gas. 

298
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,720
Sorry,honey. 

299
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,040
I need my car. 

300
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:14,390
But,gracie,if the clinic goes down,
people could die. 

301
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,300
I sympathize,eric,but I already 
gave this town my whole store. 

302
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,360
Someone else can donate gas. 

303
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,340
Bill. 

304
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,300
What's up ? 

305
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,930
I'm going to head to the 
clinic with what I've got. 

306
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,460
How are things on your end ? 

307
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,750
It's not looking good. 

308
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,910
We're still 90 gallons short at the clinic. 

309
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,240
People are scared,eriC. 

310
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,640
They're hoarding. 

311
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,260
Maybe we can't afford to be so polite. 

312
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,220
I couldn't find an empty pesticide container. 

313
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,370
I thought this water tank might do. 

314
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,860
No,no,we can't use steel. 

315
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,420
There's too much risk of static. 

316
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,080
One spark,the whole thing could blow sky-high. 

317
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,050
We don't have time to look for something else. 

318
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,600
Well-well,who's going to fill it ? 

319
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,540
Well,what do you want to do,draw straws ? 

320
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,760
No,I'll do it,you got bonnie to take care of. 

321
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,970
Don't be a martyr. 

322
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,960
I've already been irradiated. I'm doomed. 

323
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,580
No,you're going to live to be 100,remember ? 

324
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,760
Our pacts never work out. 

325
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,800
Let's just do this before 
we think about it too much. 

326
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,460
Get off the truck,stanley. Get off the truck. 

327
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,110
Back up. 

328
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,520
Dale: Hey,allison. 

329
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,230
This place has been a zoo all day. 

330
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,470
Uh,that's $1. 69. 

331
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,120
Okay. 

332
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,570
You got the last bag of corn chips. 

333
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,520
I'll give you 20 bucks for them. 

334
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,280
She picked them up first. 

335
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,080
Fine,I'll give you the 20. 

336
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,460
Or how about this ? I'm having a party. 

337
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,690
If you give me the chips,then I'll invite you. 

338
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,180
I don't even know you. 

339
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:44,920
So ? 

340
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,610
It's not like there's anything else to do. 

341
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,380
You're awesome. 

342
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,910
Come by anytime,it's the big house 
at the top of the pines. 

343
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,180
Okay,well,thanks,I guess. 

344
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,890
Hi. 

345
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,770
oh,god...

346
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,290
the generator's down ! 

347
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,010
Somebody call april. 

348
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,380
Hurry. 

349
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,080
We've lost all his machines. 

350
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,050
He's not breathing. 

351
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,640
Okay,I've got to get to the baby 
and I only have one hand pumP. 

352
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:11,920
You used to be a nurse,gail. 

353
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,490
You'll do fine. 

354
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,160
Let's go. 

355
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,910
Keep a steady pace. 

356
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,830
Uh,guys,we have a problem. 

357
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,560
It's stuck. 

358
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:55,910
No,no...

359
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,410
wait,wait,wait,wait,wait,wait,wait ! 

360
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,090
Don't feel bad. 

361
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,600
I'll loosen it up for you. 
No. 

362
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,470
The gas has been sloshing around 
in there,building up fumes. 

363
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,580
If you force the cap,and it sparks...
what do you want to do,huh ? 

364
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:09,310
Look,with all the static electricity built up,
we could blow the thing to kingdom come. 

365
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,420
That was dumb. 

366
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,110
All right,here,get that to him. 

367
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,350
Let's go ! 

368
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,740
I can't get a heartbeat. 

369
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,460
Let's go ! 

370
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,260
All right,got it. Go,stanley. 

371
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,330
how's he doing ? 

372
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,420
He was down for about two minutes. 

373
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,110
I need help with the cardiac feed. 

374
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,050
See that black switch ? 

375
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,680
Can you turn that on ? 

376
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,680
oh,right. 

377
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,160
I invited you. 

378
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,400
Oh,yeah,but,you know I don'T...I don't have to...

379
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,450
no,forget it. 

380
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,580
Come in. 

381
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,530
Hey,where's april ? 

382
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,930
Come on. 

383
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,410
Come on. 

384
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,670
april...

385
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,760
I got 75 gallons of gas. 

386
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,630
For the generator. 

387
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,040
Thanks. 

388
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,540
We got it covered. 

389
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,580
sky,look who invited himself. 

390
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,430
Just put it over there. 

391
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,580
Why are you such a jerk when you're with your friends ? 

392
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,770
Did I interrupt a lover's spat ? 

393
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,890
Stop it,lisa. 

394
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,470
You know what ? 

395
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,710
I'm gonna go home. 

396
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,090
I only came here 'cause you begged me to. 

397
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,570
Just...

398
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,180
go home. 

399
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,290
victor ! 

400
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,390
you're okay. 

401
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,580
April ! 

402
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,860
april ! 

403
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,750
Vic...

404
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,410
victor,you said they're coming. 

405
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,760
Who's coming ? 

406
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,770
they need...

407
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,580
help. 

408
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:28,240
Who does ? 

409
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,240
Who needs help ? 

410
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,990
20 from...denver. 

411
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,540
Where are they,huh ? 

412
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,120
Where are they ? 

413
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,090
Lake...

414
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,500
a lake ? 

415
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,710
boat. Boat dock. 

416
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,420
A lake with a boat dock ? 

417
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,390
A lake with a boat dock. 

418
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,950
What road is it on,do you remember ? 

419
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,680
I...

420
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:54,670
have my...daughter. 

421
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,890
Coming...

422
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,450
april ! 

423
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,150
can I help you ? 

424
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,850
Hey,turn that down. 

425
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,280
Yeah,we had a complaint that you're using too much power. 

426
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,080
And ? 

427
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,940
And...

428
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,860
the party's over. 

429
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:31,930
You can't do this. 

430
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,190
This is a private home. 

431
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,450
all right,everybody pack it up. 

432
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,020
how much gas you using to run this place,skylar ? 

433
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,140
None of your business. 

434
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,060
It's my generator,it's my gas. 

435
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,010
Right. 

436
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,280
What ?  ! 

437
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,190
Just go home. 

438
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,760
Jimmy. 

439
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,860
Jimmy ! 

440
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,590
You got to get over here. We found shep's truck. 

441
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,050
Bill ? 

442
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,440
No sign of shep,but look what I found inside. 

443
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:20,850
Looks like victor miller forgot his wallet. 

444
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:25,260
This is the man you were talking about ? 

445
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,110
The...

446
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,900
The stranger in the hospital ? 

447
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,920
You recognize him ? 

448
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,680
No. 

449
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,290
I just think we should ask him 
what he did with your friend shep. 

450
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,950
April,we need to talk to victor miller. 

451
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,780
He's unconscious. 

452
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,640
I think you need to wake him up. 

453
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,130
No. 

454
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,370
Still the same stuff. 

455
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:08,610
Look at all the people running. 

456
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,010
What if they come here ? 

457
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,570
You worked a miracle. 

458
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,650
Generator's full; we can go three more days. 

459
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,700
Great,three days. 

460
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,900
Everything's going to be all right. 

461
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,700
You know,when you say it,I almost believe it. 

462
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,590
Eric,you there ? 

463
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,310
Go,jimmy. 

464
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,090
We found shep's truck. 

465
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,600
Meet us at the clinic. 

466
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,160
I'm on my way. 

467
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:50,790
It doesn't matter. 

468
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,470
We have got to go look for his family. 

469
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,250
Why'd he have shep's truck ? 

470
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,470
We need to know what he did with him. 

471
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,520
I know,but we can't just torture a dying man. 

472
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,140
No one is torturing anyone. 

473
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,280
We could give him a shot of adrenaline. 

474
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,040
It'll wake him up enough to question him. 

475
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,160
He's dying of third degree burns. 

476
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,730
It'll be like waking him up on fire. 

477
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,620
our people are dying out there. 

478
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,340
Shep may already be dead. 

479
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,790
We need to protect ourselves,jake. 

480
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,480
We need to protect ourselves from this. 

481
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,380
Jake,shep,he's one of us. 

482
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,180
We need to find out what this guy did to him. 

483
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,180
Hey,he is going to die,anyway. 

484
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,980
But he could save some people's lives. 

485
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,360
Eric. 

486
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,430
I'd like to do this myself. 

487
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:41,430
No,I'm not leaving him. 

488
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,320
Okay. 

489
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,660
What's going on in there ? 

490
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,280
They're asking him a few questions. 

491
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,800
Like hell they will. That's my patient. 

492
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:54,980
Let go of me. 

493
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,510
We need information. 

494
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,330
You have no right. 
He could be a murderer. 

495
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,960
And that gives you the power to do anything that you want ? 

496
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,420
Yes. 

497
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,070
Yes. 

498
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,100
victor,it's going to be okay. 

499
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,650
We'll make this quick,all right ? 

500
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:24,060
the car you drove here...did someone give it to you ? 

501
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,640
No,no. 

502
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,970
It was...

503
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,060
it was...

504
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,180
on the side...of the road. 

505
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,250
Okay. 

506
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,170
it was...running. 

507
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,030
Okay,okay. 

508
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,660
But was there anybody in it ? 

509
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,360
No. 

510
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:44,450
I had...to help them. 

511
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,090
Where are they ? 

512
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,010
Do you remember anything else about the lake ? 

513
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,820
It burns. 
Was it off a dirt road ? 

514
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,780
It burns. 

515
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,980
He needs morphine. 

516
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,070
Was your daughter at bass lake ? 

517
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:55,630
Y-yes. 

518
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,650
He needs morphine,jake. 
Please,please. 

519
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:09,320
We said families only,hmm ? 

520
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,530
Why ? 

521
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,720
Why did you go back to denver ? 

522
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,940
I couldn't let them die. 

523
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,920
It was a mistake,vic,
because now we are a man down. 

524
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,810
s-someone...

525
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,540
Someone flipped. 

526
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,700
A traitor. 

527
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,350
There'S...

528
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,150
a tra...traitoR. 

529
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,590
Do you know who it was ? 

530
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,110
come on,man,tell me. 

531
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,200
vic,who was it ? 

532
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,080
Tell me. 

533
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,070
Do you know who it was ? 

534
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,070
you...know. 

535
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,050
lead fail

536
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,520
he's gone. 

537
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,910
We had to do it. 

538
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:52,350
I thought you were going to a party,hon. 

539
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,530
You're worth ten of her. 

540
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,610
Ten of who ? 

541
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,050
Skylar stevens. 

542
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,940
She's not a bad person. 

543
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,290
We're not like them. 

544
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,250
They can be nice sometimes,but don't be fooled. 

545
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,200
That's what my mom used to say. 

546
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,240
Well,she was a smart lady. 

547
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,000
you scared ? 

548
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,590
'Cause I remember when I did something wrong,

549
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:52,160
waiting for my old man to come home. 

550
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:05,110
Baby,what you did today--

551
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:08,510
that wasn't just you going to a party. 

552
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:17,300
It wasn'T. You put your mother,
your brother,all of us at risk. 

553
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,900
Do you hear ? 

554
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,010
And if you pull something like this again,

555
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:33,000
girl,you have no idea how scared you'll be. 

556
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,670
I need a few volunteers. 

557
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,230
There's a group of people just outside of town. 

558
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,260
No way,man ! 

559
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,740
It's too dangerous out there ! 

560
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,790
They're at bass lake. 

561
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,220
They may have radiation sickness. 

562
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,390
We need to bring them here get them 
to the clinic before it's too late. 

563
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,590
Turn it back on ! 

564
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,700
We've seen it. 

565
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,170
We've seen it 100 timeS. 

566
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,710
A man just died in our clinic. 

567
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,760
Our clinic ! 

568
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:30,650
He was traveling with his daughter 
and about 20 other people. 

569
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:38,040
All right,it could have been 
shep or gray or any of us. 

570
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,560
They need our help. 

571
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,940
Are we going to help them ? 

572
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:49,090
Or are we just going to sit here watching 
the same three images over and over ? 

573
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,510
Jake ? 

574
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:05,290
I'll donate gas if you need 
to fill your car to get them. 

575
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,160
Thank you,mary. 

576
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,050
I'll go with you. 

577
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,020
Thank you. 

578
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,780
Anybody else ? 

579
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,720
I'll go with you,jake. 

580
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,230
I'll go. 
Let's go. 

581
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,830
Yeah,me,too. 

582
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:20,910
Thank you. 

583
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:10,720
Earlier today,we buried 20 people...
refugees from denver. 

584
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:18,030
People we didn't know,but were 
prepared to welcome into our town. 

585
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:23,000
Unfortunately,they died of radiation 
poisoning before we could reach them. 

586
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:31,700
For those people from denver,and for our 
own people,for sheriff dawes and deputy riley,

587
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:35,280
for deputy conner and deputy salem...

588
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:44,500
for eople out there somewhere we know nothing 
about who might be suffering and dying right now...

589
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:48,530
I ask that we take a moment of silence. 

590
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:58,050
If you've lost a loved one,would you please stand ? 

591
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:10,780
If someone you love is missing,
would you join those standing ? 

592
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:28,240
We stand because we know that every life matters. 

593
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,360
We have to fight for every life,

594
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:40,270
even when it seems hopeless,even when we're afraid,

595
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:46,990
because the battle ahead isn't just for our survival,

596
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,510
it's for our humanity. 

597
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,530
I think I'm going to be okay. 

598
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,890
Jake. 

599
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,620
Hi. 

600
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:27,540
You're a good man for trying to help 
someone you didn't even know. 

601
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:50,840
we have a traitor

602
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,820
we have a traitor,the rally point 
is no longer secure

603
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,590
sending...

604
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,740
hey,you thirsty again ? 

605
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,090
No. 

606
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,350
Couldn't sleep. 

607
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,030
Where did you go to school,sam ? 

608
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,910
Crow island. 

609
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,800
Who is your dad ? 

610
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,320
You. 

611
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:54,200
Who loves you more than anything in the world ? 

612
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,640
You. 

613
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:03,330
And,sam,who is always going to take care of you ? 

614
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,520
Mommy.
