1
00:00:00,043 --> 00:00:01,390
<i>Previously on Jericho</i>

2
00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:03,342
Some of them were on planes

3
00:00:03,468 --> 00:00:05,028
that landed in
the middle of nowhere.

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,799
They've been walking for weeks.

5
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:08,880
They must have gone
through hell.

6
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:11,900
Oh, my God.
Roger.

7
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:15,206
There's a woman in that
group of refugees that

8
00:00:15,207 --> 00:00:16,461
Bill is processing.

9
00:00:16,462 --> 00:00:17,725
I think you should talk to her.

10
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:19,282
Hello, Rob.

11
00:00:19,283 --> 00:00:21,462
Someone on my team
sold us all out.

12
00:00:21,463 --> 00:00:24,675
You're smart enough to know that they
would say anything to get you to talk.

13
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,529
At current levels of consumption,

14
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,699
we will be completely
out of gas and diesel in two weeks.

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,134
We can live without
power for now,

16
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:35,855
but we won't see spring
if we don't eat.

17
00:00:35,856 --> 00:00:37,200
All right, look,
the further out you get,

18
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:38,399
the hairier the roads are,

19
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,864
and food being
as scarce as it is,

20
00:00:39,865 --> 00:00:41,425
there's bound to be
trouble out there.

21
00:00:41,426 --> 00:00:42,872
Why are they following us?

22
00:00:42,994 --> 00:00:44,064
Stanley, hold on!

23
00:00:47,373 --> 00:00:49,939
Jake!
It's Mom and Dad, honey!

24
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:51,405
You're going to be all right.

25
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:54,298
So, I'm being watched?

26
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,699
It's the Old Man.

27
00:00:55,977 --> 00:00:57,983
He's coming for us,
using us against each other.

28
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,549
If they kill me,
they will never find the package.

29
00:01:01,514 --> 00:01:03,211
I have something
in my possession,

30
00:01:03,212 --> 00:01:04,987
and there's people
out there that want it.

31
00:01:04,988 --> 00:01:08,000
And that puts you, me
and the kids in danger here.

32
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:09,423
Then listen to me...

33
00:01:09,597 --> 00:01:11,333
Sarah is not on our side.

34
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:13,899
I'm telling you, Robert,
she's not here to help us.

35
00:01:14,265 --> 00:01:16,348
Hawkins is starting to put
the pieces together.

36
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:17,738
He needs to be eliminated.

37
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,111
- I know.
- Why are you stalling on this one?

38
00:01:25,378 --> 00:01:27,481
Because this one is different.

39
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:41,802
You won't make it out of Kansas
with the fuel you've got,

40
00:01:41,803 --> 00:01:43,534
and you're not going to find
another drop out there.

41
00:01:43,706 --> 00:01:47,152
The folks who left last week
are probably in Arizona by now.

42
00:01:47,218 --> 00:01:48,949
If they weren't
murdered on the highway.

43
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,852
It is suicide to leave, Ridley.

44
00:01:51,563 --> 00:01:53,785
There's no food, no heat.

45
00:01:54,355 --> 00:01:55,884
It's suicide if we stay.

46
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:02,759
This... this is everything.

47
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,010
I mean, it's every farm.

48
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,841
At least until the spring crops come in,
and that could take months.

49
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:10,002
And what if we don't
factor in the refugees?

50
00:02:10,003 --> 00:02:11,563
They're a part of this town now.

51
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,200
A lot of extra mouths to feed.

52
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:14,513
They've done their part, Gray.

53
00:02:14,652 --> 00:02:16,165
They've helped hunt,
cut firewood...

54
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,333
Resources they use up five times
faster than they supply them.

55
00:02:19,334 --> 00:02:20,814
When the windmills come in
from New Bern,

56
00:02:20,815 --> 00:02:22,268
most of our fuel issues
will be solved.

57
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:23,828
What about every day until then?

58
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:26,393
Ridley and his group
are about to leave.

59
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:29,219
If people want to try and make it
on their own, that's their right.

60
00:02:29,237 --> 00:02:31,117
You know as well as I do that
come springtime,

61
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:32,666
we'll find their bodies out there.

62
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:34,572
Well, what do you want me to do,
Johnston?

63
00:02:34,573 --> 00:02:36,465
Wh-What am I missing
that's not on that board?

64
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:38,202
You find it for me,
'cause I don't see it.

65
00:02:38,203 --> 00:02:41,269
Without some "X" factor,

66
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,152
we're not going to make it
through the winter.

67
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:44,511
Not all of us.

68
00:02:47,347 --> 00:02:49,527
We have to make
some hard decisions.

69
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:55,585
And I think the last ones in
should be the first ones to go.

70
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:14,087
Clear the streets!

71
00:03:15,746 --> 00:03:17,386
We need to clear the streets!

72
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:12,400
Who's in charge here?

73
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,150
I'm Gray Anderson.

74
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,809
I'm the mayor of Jericho.

75
00:04:18,618 --> 00:04:20,075
Glad to meet you,
Mayor Anderson.

76
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,994
I'm Gunnery Sergeant Hill.
Fourth MAR-DIV,

77
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,962
Fourth Tank Battalion,
Charlie Company.

78
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,390
So you're...?

79
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,610
Sir,

80
00:04:27,088 --> 00:04:29,827
we're the United States Marines,
and we're here to help.

85
00:04:46,796 --> 00:04:48,296
They sent the marines?

86
00:04:50,137 --> 00:04:53,131
We were deployed to Western Kansas
to set up a firm base

87
00:04:53,766 --> 00:04:57,322
and prep the outlying towns for the
arrival of the Army Corps of Engineers.

88
00:04:57,716 --> 00:05:00,537
Now that we've won the war,
it's time to start rebuilding.

89
00:05:00,628 --> 00:05:01,851
War? What war?

90
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:06,029
- You didn't hear?
- No.

91
00:05:06,148 --> 00:05:08,455
We lost all communications
after the EMP.

92
00:05:08,502 --> 00:05:11,819
Well, we nuked the hell
out of North Korea and Iran.

93
00:05:14,277 --> 00:05:15,360
So they were behind it?

94
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:17,872
From what I hear, which isn't much,
Iran financed it,

95
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:19,809
North Korea supplied the bombs.

96
00:05:19,984 --> 00:05:22,199
We've got troops all over the world
going after the...

97
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,838
terrorists who snuck them in,

98
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,752
but at least we took
out the big dogs.

99
00:05:25,786 --> 00:05:27,052
What happens now?

100
00:05:27,315 --> 00:05:29,755
Largest reconstruction effort
in the history of the country.

101
00:05:29,756 --> 00:05:31,779
So there's somebody
finally in charge?

102
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,975
The former secretary of HHS
is now the president.

103
00:05:33,976 --> 00:05:35,479
We heard there
were six guys

104
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,795
from six different capitals
claiming to be president.

105
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:38,891
Resolved.

106
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:41,284
The federal government
is reunifying in Columbus, Ohio.

107
00:05:41,296 --> 00:05:42,844
How did they
decide on Columbus?

108
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:44,292
All I know is, my orders are coming

109
00:05:44,293 --> 00:05:46,486
from the commanding officer
of the Fourth Battalion,

110
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:48,369
and
those are to restore lights,

111
00:05:48,755 --> 00:05:52,096
power and infrastructure
to Kansas, one town at a time.

112
00:05:56,235 --> 00:05:58,662
W- Wait, wait.
When is that going to happen?

113
00:05:58,663 --> 00:06:01,945
Should have your shelves full of Oreos
and Hot Pockets by the end of the year.

114
00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:06,927
Welcome back to the grid, Jericho.

115
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,210
Thank God for
the US Marines.

116
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:21,189
Hey! Hey! It's over.

117
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:28,255
There are kids out here.
Get a room.

118
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:35,697
Come on. We should have been
on the road yesterday.

119
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,419
Well, I'm packed.

120
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,968
Hi. We're all fueled up.

121
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:45,337
How are we doing?

122
00:06:45,683 --> 00:06:47,753
We'll be ready when we're ready.

123
00:06:50,974 --> 00:06:53,725
I'll get the rest of my things
from downstairs.

124
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:58,419
How many more times
are we going to have to move?

125
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,962
- This should do it.
- Really?

126
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:03,644
You're going to stay in
one place from now on?

127
00:07:07,354 --> 00:07:09,331
Sergeant Green. Marine Corps?

128
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:11,081
Ah, hell, no.
Army Rangers.

129
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:13,446
Well, I'll try not to hold it
against you.

130
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,481
Listen, Gunny, how long
before the engineers get here?

131
00:07:16,663 --> 00:07:18,544
Could be two days,
could be two weeks.

132
00:07:18,555 --> 00:07:20,913
In the meantime, why don't you get
a wish list of what you need,

133
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:23,554
and I'll forward that on to Battalion
Headquarters in Dodge City,

134
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:26,081
and we'll start to get y'all back on
your feet.  - Roger that.

135
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:28,322
Just tell me how
I can be of service.

136
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,399
Going to need
a command post.

137
00:07:30,453 --> 00:07:32,006
- Use the sheriff's office.
- Great.

138
00:07:32,446 --> 00:07:33,462
Excuse me.

139
00:07:34,945 --> 00:07:36,562
If you guys are going
to be here for a while,

140
00:07:36,563 --> 00:07:38,579
why don't I take your men
over to my tavern.

141
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:40,838
Thanks, ma'am,
my troops could use it.

142
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,738
Wymore!
Front and center!

143
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,338
Move it, move it!

144
00:07:44,838 --> 00:07:46,621
Muster up and follow
this young lady here.

145
00:07:46,622 --> 00:07:48,462
The liberty call is
sounded, but remember...

146
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:50,362
conduct yourselves like marines.
- Aye Sir.

147
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,154
Don't you "sir" me, PFC.

148
00:07:52,287 --> 00:07:53,937
I work for a living.
Dismissed!

149
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,170
Aye, aye, Gunnery Sergeant.

150
00:07:57,462 --> 00:08:00,591
Couple of months ago, I would have had
that kid doing push-ups till he puked,

151
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:02,174
but, uh, they've
been through a lot.

152
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,507
I understand.
Anything else we can do?

153
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,682
Well, Sergeant, uh...
one other thing.

154
00:08:07,832 --> 00:08:09,216
Corporal Mullin!

155
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:12,624
Hi. Uh, I'm looking to scavenge
some replacement parts.

156
00:08:12,707 --> 00:08:14,990
Our radio, well, it took
a couple of pretty good hits.

157
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:16,682
Do you have any idea
where I could start?

158
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:17,915
Maybe I could help.

159
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:19,274
Oh, Lance Corporal Mullin.

160
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:20,690
- Jake.
- Maggie.

161
00:08:21,157 --> 00:08:23,023
So you're the town's
electronics expert?

162
00:08:23,207 --> 00:08:24,757
No, I'm not an expert
at anything.

163
00:08:24,758 --> 00:08:26,857
- But I can improvise.
- I'll take that.

164
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,690
We'll see what
we can find.

165
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:44,559
So, uh...

166
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:47,065
I've been thinking...

167
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:50,292
Maybe leaving my family...

168
00:08:50,992 --> 00:08:52,276
isn't such a good idea.

169
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:54,025
What?

170
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:56,242
Why?
We've been over this.

171
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:57,958
They-they're not safe
here with you.

172
00:08:58,008 --> 00:08:59,025
I know.

173
00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:01,091
There are people out there
who would...

174
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,808
hurt them in order to get to me.

175
00:09:04,082 --> 00:09:05,657
But at least I understand
the dangers.

176
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:06,690
I can protect them.

177
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,082
You're not thinking straight.

178
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,449
This is my family, Sarah.

179
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:11,333
It never mattered before.

180
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:13,099
Now it does.

181
00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:16,799
What's it going to take...

182
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:20,224
someone slitting your wife's throat
before you get it ?

183
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,384
You're right.

184
00:09:29,342 --> 00:09:31,359
We will drop them
at the safe house,

185
00:09:32,075 --> 00:09:33,575
and then we'll keep moving.

186
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,375
It's the right thing for them.

187
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:03,842
I just realized...
Hmm?

188
00:10:04,475 --> 00:10:06,483
If the government
is up and running,

189
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,683
you know what that means, right?
- No

190
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:09,824
Paperwork.

191
00:10:10,358 --> 00:10:11,774
They'll need
accountants again.

192
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:13,108
Does that mean I'm back in debt?

193
00:10:13,124 --> 00:10:15,308
Don't be so negative.
New York made it.

194
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:17,399
Come next summer,

195
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,713
I'll be taking walks
though Central Park.

196
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:21,421
What?

197
00:10:21,729 --> 00:10:23,546
Dude!
This is awesome!

198
00:10:23,547 --> 00:10:25,470
I could totally
be a marine.

199
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,948
I could totally see that happening...

200
00:10:28,164 --> 00:10:29,964
Except for everything about you.

201
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:39,667
God, I...

202
00:10:39,692 --> 00:10:40,925
Don't worry about her.

203
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:42,742
It's a phase, trust me.

204
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:45,158
The minute everything
calms down,

205
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,308
he's as good as gone.

206
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,032
Yeah, yeah, maybe
you can give him a ride

207
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:49,558
out of town
on the way to New York.

208
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:53,225
Thinking about leaving
this town is not

209
00:10:53,226 --> 00:10:55,825
the same thing as thinking
about leaving you.

210
00:10:55,826 --> 00:10:56,842
No?

211
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,433
Well, it adds up to
the same thing, Mimi.

212
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,060
Maybe you could
come with me.

213
00:11:05,843 --> 00:11:08,176
Yeah, I'm-I'm sorry.
That's not my life.

214
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,910
Well, this isn't mine.

215
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,813
I've missed you.

216
00:11:30,496 --> 00:11:31,496
Me, too.

217
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:36,659
We should get going.

218
00:11:39,828 --> 00:11:41,694
Start loading up
the truck, huh?

219
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:46,328
Go on, get out of here.

220
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,192
I heard what happened.
Are you okay?

221
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:25,875
Yeah, I'm better than the truck.

222
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:29,525
Be able to quit worrying about you
one of these days, right?

223
00:12:30,925 --> 00:12:32,666
Hey, Jake.
Amazing, huh?

224
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:34,295
Yeah, it's great news.

225
00:12:35,762 --> 00:12:36,828
I'll see you later.

226
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:42,313
How are most of
the towns out there?

227
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:44,542
Let's just say
I haven't seen

228
00:12:44,543 --> 00:12:46,592
anything like this
since we entered the CZ.

229
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:47,809
"CZ"?

230
00:12:48,192 --> 00:12:49,375
Contamination Zone.

231
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:50,713
You're in CZ-12,

232
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:52,604
and you're better
off than most.

233
00:12:52,729 --> 00:12:53,829
That's hard to imagine.

234
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:56,354
Try taking a walk through what's
left of Lawrence, Kansas.

235
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:57,479
What's it like?

236
00:12:58,121 --> 00:12:59,456
Buildings
are all gone.

237
00:12:59,556 --> 00:13:01,673
People who are left are
fighting their neighbors

238
00:13:01,674 --> 00:13:02,756
for food and water.

239
00:13:03,832 --> 00:13:06,829
Makes you wonder if the
survivors are the lucky ones.

240
00:13:12,845 --> 00:13:15,451
We need a transistor
for their radio.

241
00:13:15,518 --> 00:13:17,035
Can we take
apart the jukebox?

242
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:18,985
Oh, you're going to take
my music?

243
00:13:19,418 --> 00:13:21,351
Isn't there anything else
you can take apart?

244
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:23,992
You've got three
Spin Doctors albums on here.

245
00:13:24,354 --> 00:13:26,137
Trust me, it's a public service.

246
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:29,508
Don't worry, there's an old
ham radio in City Hall.

247
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,124
Maybe we can take that apart.

248
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:32,982
- Thanks anyway.
- Bye.

249
00:13:35,943 --> 00:13:36,943
Oh, hey, big guy.

250
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:40,126
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

251
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:30,917
I think you have something
of mine.

252
00:14:36,638 --> 00:14:38,999
Sweetie,
let's sit down on the couch.

253
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:40,973
Your dad and I have
some talking to do.

254
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:42,427
You go ahead, Sam.

255
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,812
Just play with
your coloring books.

256
00:15:21,582 --> 00:15:23,010
This is what you want, right?

257
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,766
Among other things.

258
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:30,746
You been lying to me, Robert.

259
00:15:31,788 --> 00:15:33,872
When did you fall back
in love with your wife?

260
00:15:37,576 --> 00:15:38,579
It's okay.

261
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:40,567
You go back to your book.
Go ahead.

262
00:15:46,606 --> 00:15:49,693
We tried to institute
rationing early on,

263
00:15:49,694 --> 00:15:51,815
but it took some time
for people to accept

264
00:15:51,816 --> 00:15:53,203
that we were really
on our own.

265
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:56,821
Looks like you did a better job
than most towns I've seen.

266
00:15:57,009 --> 00:15:58,991
Town's lucky to have
a military man in charge.

267
00:15:59,281 --> 00:16:00,784
Well, I guess we
made out all right.

268
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:02,253
With salt from my mine,

269
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:04,573
we've been able to do
some trading with nearby towns.

270
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:06,636
Your town seems
to have been blessed.

271
00:16:07,574 --> 00:16:08,796
That said, uh...

272
00:16:08,953 --> 00:16:10,799
I can't say you'll be
a priority on the list.

273
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,170
Um, uh...
Wait a minute... what list?

274
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:16,416
We got detachments all over Kansas
assessing each town's needs.

275
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:19,345
Relief is given
on an as needed basis.

276
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,058
Wait a second.
You're saying that because

277
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:23,519
we planned better than others
it will come against us?

278
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,090
We can make out for
a while longer if we have to.

279
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:28,903
That's easy for you to say.
You're not being held accountable.

280
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:31,083
Why don't you give me
that want list and, uh,

281
00:16:31,084 --> 00:16:32,548
I'll see what I can do.

282
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:42,647
Try that one.

283
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,782
Perfect.

284
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:50,927
So you're really not going
to tell me what happened?

285
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:53,353
Doc says frostbite.

286
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,108
Doctor also say
who kicked your ass?

287
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:01,934
Someone ran us off the road.

288
00:17:02,662 --> 00:17:04,899
Most of it's a blur.
Just, uh,

289
00:17:05,803 --> 00:17:07,414
tried to stay alive, you know?

290
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,634
I do.

291
00:17:14,017 --> 00:17:15,932
- So, the marines, huh?
- Yeah.

292
00:17:16,212 --> 00:17:17,940
Is it everything you hoped for?

293
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,295
There are moments.

294
00:17:20,683 --> 00:17:23,549
But when I signed up, I never
thought I'd be fighting Americans.

295
00:17:25,495 --> 00:17:27,544
Good people forced
to do bad things.

296
00:17:27,758 --> 00:17:29,553
That's got to be rough.
I'm sorry.

297
00:17:29,586 --> 00:17:30,885
It's not your problem.

298
00:17:36,818 --> 00:17:37,943
What?

299
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:41,424
Just, uh,

300
00:17:42,576 --> 00:17:44,960
wondering why someone like you
would join the marines.

301
00:17:45,027 --> 00:17:46,473
Someone like me?

302
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,385
I had an office job
until a few years ago,

303
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:51,415
but I got bored.

304
00:17:51,897 --> 00:17:53,303
I wanted to see the world.

305
00:17:53,304 --> 00:17:55,200
- Have you?
- I've seen Omaha.

306
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:58,349
- You?
- What, seen the world? Yeah.

307
00:18:00,637 --> 00:18:02,632
Yeah, I just saw
all the wrong places.

308
00:18:04,447 --> 00:18:05,454
Man,

309
00:18:05,947 --> 00:18:09,397
you have this brooding,
bad-boy thing down to an art.

310
00:18:18,225 --> 00:18:20,603
The video I was sent
before the attacks,

311
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:23,099
those people were not
holding you captive.

312
00:18:23,463 --> 00:18:24,727
You were just...

313
00:18:24,941 --> 00:18:26,430
what, you were playing me?

314
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:27,984
Me playing you?

315
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,458
We were living together.

316
00:18:31,671 --> 00:18:34,371
I showed up here
and you have a family again.

317
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:37,575
It's okay.
It's just a...

318
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:41,346
a story, you know?
It's just a story we're telling.

319
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:42,718
Go back to your book.

320
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,700
You made me promises, Robert.

321
00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:46,986
Who were the people in that video?

322
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,539
Is that who you're working for?

323
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:51,078
I was. Now,
I'm working for myself.

324
00:18:52,517 --> 00:18:54,359
So why don't you
give me what I want,

325
00:18:54,574 --> 00:18:56,663
and then this story
can have a happy ending.

326
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,563
What are you gonna do
in the Marines finally...

327
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:06,899
- cut you loose?
- I try not to think about it.

328
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:08,115
That means you have.

329
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:11,022
After everything I've seen...

330
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:14,037
I'd like to find a nice little town

331
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:16,052
and just settle in
for the duration.

332
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:18,194
I don't think those
exist anymore.

333
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,127
I just found out they do.

334
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:24,354
What about you?

335
00:19:24,386 --> 00:19:26,012
You ever thought
about flying again?

336
00:19:26,303 --> 00:19:27,396
Maybe for the military?

337
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:29,571
Sure. Safer than being
on the ground, right?

338
00:19:29,616 --> 00:19:31,395
Not if you're a radio operator.

339
00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:33,755
I'm the safest of all.
I get to ride in the tank.

340
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:36,298
But if you ride in the tank,
how'd the radio get shot?

341
00:19:36,646 --> 00:19:37,953
What, you think a girl can't...

342
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,450
get out and kick some ass
every once in a while?

343
00:19:42,903 --> 00:19:44,938
Who you trying to call
on that thing anyway?

344
00:19:44,939 --> 00:19:47,010
Uh, division headquarters
in Dodge City.

345
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:48,188
That's about 200 miles away.

346
00:19:48,189 --> 00:19:49,548
This thing's made it farther.

347
00:19:49,612 --> 00:19:51,915
Of course, that was
before it took some rounds.

348
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:56,484
Fourth MAR-DIV.
Fourth MAR-DIV,

349
00:19:56,485 --> 00:19:59,499
this is First Platoon, Charlie Company.
Authentication "thunder." Over.

350
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:04,631
Fourth MAR-DIV.
Fourth MAR-DIV.

351
00:20:04,632 --> 00:20:07,696
This is First Platoon, Charlie Company.
Authentication "thunder." Over.

352
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:11,317
<i>Lima Charlie Thunder.
This is Charlie Company Actual.</i>

353
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:14,093
<I>We've been trying to raise you
on this frequency for days.

354
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,318
<I>Division needs the entire
fourth tank battalion RTB ASAP.

355
00:20:18,534 --> 00:20:19,798
<I>Do you copy?

356
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,319
Aye, aye, sir.

357
00:20:22,406 --> 00:20:24,270
<I>Make that most tricky-tick, Corporal.

358
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:26,994
Roger that,
Charlie Company Actual, out.

359
00:20:32,908 --> 00:20:33,915
What's going on?

360
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:37,118
We just got ordered
back to Dodge City.

361
00:20:40,311 --> 00:20:42,368
What are you going to do
with the package, Sarah?

362
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:43,975
Sell it.

363
00:20:44,794 --> 00:20:46,841
And get as far away
from here as possible.

364
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,842
What happened to you?

365
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:02,342
The last few months,

366
00:21:02,836 --> 00:21:04,453
I've learned two things.

367
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:06,628
Everybody has a price.

368
00:21:07,764 --> 00:21:09,403
And everybody lies.

369
00:21:13,925 --> 00:21:14,942
Sit still, Sam.

370
00:21:14,943 --> 00:21:16,281
- Take your...
- Stay there

371
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,787
I was just having a conversation
with your husband...

372
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:21,176
about what's more
important to him...

373
00:21:21,237 --> 00:21:22,254
His job...

374
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,407
or his family.

375
00:21:37,683 --> 00:21:38,791
Why are you leaving ?

376
00:21:38,801 --> 00:21:40,167
Because we were
ordered to.

377
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:42,299
Sorry, but I can't reveal
operational orders.

378
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,550
Army Corps of Engineers
will be through eventually.

379
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,967
Eventually?
How long?

380
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,667
Sir, listen, I'm sorry,
but I just don't know.

381
00:21:50,132 --> 00:21:51,799
You ready to roll?
Good to go, Gunny.

382
00:21:51,924 --> 00:21:53,066
But I don't know
about the tank.

383
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:55,349
Don't know if we have enough fuel
to make it back to Dodge City.

384
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,450
Leave it behind
if we have to.

385
00:21:56,451 --> 00:21:58,600
We'll post Sigloch and Kent here
till we can make it back.

386
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,874
Sergeant, without armor we're
sitting ducks for those highwaymen.

387
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,717
We're marines. We'll make do.

388
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,534
I can get you fuel.

389
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,116
Not much, but enough
to get you back to Dodge.

390
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,550
Just give me an hour.

391
00:22:10,817 --> 00:22:11,834
I'm listening.

392
00:22:12,717 --> 00:22:15,300
Plus... whatever
supplies you need.

393
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,150
But I just need assurances that
Jericho will be taken care of.

394
00:22:22,017 --> 00:22:24,117
There's three C-130s
full of Red Cross supplies

395
00:22:24,118 --> 00:22:26,217
that are supposed to arrive
in Kansas in 12 days.

396
00:22:26,234 --> 00:22:28,717
I guarantee you'll be
at the top of their list.

397
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:30,066
That's all I ask.

398
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:31,716
All right, people,
listen up!

399
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:33,567
We're going to stand
down for one hour.

400
00:22:34,284 --> 00:22:38,617
When the relief effort comes,
are you guys coming with it?

401
00:22:39,016 --> 00:22:40,066
No.

402
00:22:40,816 --> 00:22:43,366
You're going have to flirt with
a whole new batch of grunts.

403
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:44,799
And the Corps of Engineers

404
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,493
are nowhere near
as cute as I am.

405
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,134
You should think about...

406
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,884
coming back when you get out.

407
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:55,734
What would I do here?

408
00:22:58,334 --> 00:23:00,934
That's a question we're all
asking ourselves, but...

409
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:03,078
you're a good fit.

410
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:07,861
You know,
before all this started,

411
00:23:09,352 --> 00:23:10,985
I might have agreed with you.

412
00:23:11,085 --> 00:23:12,102
But, uh...

413
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:16,452
I won't make it back here.

414
00:23:36,517 --> 00:23:37,584
Corporal Mullin!

415
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:39,967
Yes, Gunnery Sergeant.

416
00:23:40,034 --> 00:23:41,634
Why is your gear
not loaded up?

417
00:23:42,184 --> 00:23:43,517
- Uh...
- Don't answer that.

418
00:23:44,116 --> 00:23:45,565
We're headed over
to the town hall.

419
00:23:45,566 --> 00:23:47,217
The mayor wants
to express his appreciation.

420
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:48,774
Somebody needs to stay here.
You...

421
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:50,324
Youjust drew
the short straw.

422
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:52,508
Aye, Gunny.

423
00:23:55,425 --> 00:23:56,815
I'm going to go get

424
00:23:56,816 --> 00:23:59,537
the last of the supplies
from the sheriff's office.

425
00:24:03,595 --> 00:24:05,309
Get the package.

426
00:24:06,342 --> 00:24:08,492
You know I can't do that.

427
00:24:08,876 --> 00:24:10,959
You think I'm going
to believe a word you say?

428
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:12,934
Come on. We can work this out.

429
00:24:13,492 --> 00:24:15,409
You had your chance
to go with me.

430
00:24:15,492 --> 00:24:16,659
Please!
Shut up!

431
00:24:18,575 --> 00:24:21,200
You're losing something tonight.
I promise you that.

432
00:24:22,444 --> 00:24:23,445
Only question is,

433
00:24:23,446 --> 00:24:25,579
is it going to be something
with a heartbeat?

434
00:24:34,962 --> 00:24:36,128
I'll get the package.

435
00:24:36,545 --> 00:24:39,145
Please put that gun down.

436
00:24:40,728 --> 00:24:42,978
Why don't you get
Allison down here, too?

437
00:24:50,761 --> 00:24:53,344
<i>Lima Charlie Thunder.
This is Charlie Company Actual.</i>

438
00:24:53,345 --> 00:24:54,361
Do you copy?

439
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:56,928
Lima Charlie,
it's cold as hell out here.

440
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:59,178
Hello?
This is Jake Green.

441
00:24:59,244 --> 00:25:01,419
Jake Green, this is an official
Marine channel.

442
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,978
Get off this...

443
00:25:06,311 --> 00:25:07,328
Hello?

444
00:25:08,727 --> 00:25:10,210
Hello. Are you taking fire?

445
00:25:44,265 --> 00:25:45,273
Hey, Gunny!

446
00:25:46,865 --> 00:25:49,480
It's just a little something
to remember us by.

447
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,463
This is too kind, Mr. Mayor,

448
00:25:51,464 --> 00:25:52,495
but, uh, we really
should press on.

449
00:25:52,496 --> 00:25:54,912
No, you can't take off
on an empty stomach.

450
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,188
Come on in, I got
a little surprise for you.

451
00:25:58,321 --> 00:26:00,771
Just something to show our
gratitude. Come on.

452
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:12,605
I need you to grab some of
our guys from patrol

453
00:26:12,606 --> 00:26:14,721
and do a sweep of the
area, all right? Take guns.

454
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,638
Are you kidding?

455
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:18,117
I mean, we got
the US Marines Corps here.

456
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,600
Something's wrong about all this.
Trust me.

457
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,222
Okay, okay. Well...
what am I looking for?

458
00:26:23,672 --> 00:26:25,272
A guy with a radio for starters.

459
00:26:25,438 --> 00:26:27,466
Check anywhere within
earshot of the fireworks.

460
00:26:27,932 --> 00:26:29,716
All right, maybe it's
nothing. Just check.

461
00:26:29,816 --> 00:26:30,849
- All right? Go!
- Okay.

462
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:31,981
I can't talk.

463
00:26:33,096 --> 00:26:34,863
What?
It's good talking to you.

464
00:26:44,766 --> 00:26:46,699
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen.

465
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:48,694
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

466
00:26:50,378 --> 00:26:51,561
Honored guests.

467
00:26:53,094 --> 00:26:56,227
I was very hopeful
that former Sergeant Green

468
00:26:56,394 --> 00:26:58,010
might like to
say a few words.

469
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:09,944
Ladies and gentlemen, um...

470
00:27:10,294 --> 00:27:14,294
Marine Corps has a motto
"Semper fidelis"

471
00:27:14,678 --> 00:27:15,711
Always faithful.

472
00:27:16,894 --> 00:27:19,478
And I think it's very fitting
that in our darkest hour,

473
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:22,044
it was marines who came
to our rescue.

474
00:27:23,078 --> 00:27:24,778
Never before
in our nation's history

475
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:27,061
has a motto been so tried...

476
00:27:28,794 --> 00:27:30,361
...and so necessary.

477
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:34,844
Gunny, Marines,

478
00:27:35,778 --> 00:27:36,794
semper fi.

479
00:27:55,744 --> 00:27:57,444
So, Gunny,
the Fighting Fourth.

480
00:27:57,445 --> 00:27:59,044
Seen more than
your share of action.

481
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:02,194
From Iwo to Iraq, if there's a war,
there's the fourth.

482
00:28:02,195 --> 00:28:03,211
Semper fi.

483
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:10,561
Excuse us a second.

484
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:16,486
What is the matter?
What's going on?

485
00:28:21,953 --> 00:28:22,969
Downstairs.

486
00:28:34,189 --> 00:28:35,389
I just, uh...

487
00:28:35,773 --> 00:28:37,806
I heard the fireworks
over the marines' radio,

488
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,006
and Dodge City
is 200 miles away.

489
00:28:40,007 --> 00:28:42,123
- What?  - They've got somebody
on the edge of town

490
00:28:42,124 --> 00:28:43,940
pretending
to be their headquarters.

491
00:28:43,941 --> 00:28:46,528
I sent Stanley and a couple of
the guys to check it out.

492
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:47,978
Tell me I'm crazy.

493
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,278
If you are, so am I.

494
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,596
Nobody calls an NCO "sir,"

495
00:28:53,597 --> 00:28:55,646
and a marine
would never say, "Hoo-ah."

496
00:28:55,647 --> 00:28:56,846
That's an Army thing.

497
00:28:57,162 --> 00:28:58,729
These guys
did both.

498
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,362
Marines are all
about detail.

499
00:29:00,845 --> 00:29:03,045
Well, if they're not marines,
who are they?

500
00:29:03,762 --> 00:29:06,178
People with enough firepower
to wipe us out.

501
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:08,669
And we gave them half
the town's supplies.

502
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:13,935
What do we do?

503
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,510
Well, we've got to tell Gray.

504
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:17,810
How do we get Gray alone?
He's right next to them.

505
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,177
We got to do something
about that tank.

506
00:29:19,178 --> 00:29:21,086
That thing gets turned lose
on Main Street,

507
00:29:21,087 --> 00:29:22,103
it'll be a
bloodbath.

508
00:29:22,104 --> 00:29:25,220
Even if you get that tank, they'll still
have a room full of hostages.

509
00:29:29,681 --> 00:29:30,831
She's right.

510
00:29:31,031 --> 00:29:33,048
We better get back before
they start to wonder.

511
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:36,004
Try to get a message to Gray,
and I'll wait for Stanley.

512
00:29:36,071 --> 00:29:38,004
I'll see what I can do
about the tank.

513
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:31,183
Hey.

514
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:38,733
How was Dodge City picking up
our fireworks?

515
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,483
We pick up pops and pings
all the time...

516
00:30:42,484 --> 00:30:43,500
Don't lie to me!

517
00:30:43,783 --> 00:30:46,183
<i>Hello? Anyone out there?</i>

518
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:52,166
Stanley, is that you?

519
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:54,017
Jake, we found this guy
camping out here

520
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,825
with this radio.
Says he's with the marines.

521
00:30:55,826 --> 00:30:57,150
I'm going to bring him back.

522
00:30:58,685 --> 00:30:59,951
Is any of this real?

523
00:30:59,952 --> 00:31:01,435
The gun's real.

524
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:05,010
I'm sorry.

525
00:31:05,818 --> 00:31:07,284
You con people out
of stale food

526
00:31:07,285 --> 00:31:08,934
and enough fuel to get
to the next town?

527
00:31:08,935 --> 00:31:10,636
You don't know how bad
it is out there.

528
00:31:10,637 --> 00:31:11,719
Yeah, I do.

529
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:15,919
Where'd you get all this?

530
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:20,100
There was a food riot
in our refugee camp.

531
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,050
A dozen marines
never had a chance

532
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:25,683
against 10,000 starving people.

533
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,950
So you killed them?

534
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,967
They retreated
and we took what they left.

535
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:33,317
Tried to get some food
in the next town.

536
00:31:33,717 --> 00:31:35,783
It worked so well,
we kept doing it.

537
00:31:36,224 --> 00:31:37,015
Don't.

538
00:31:37,016 --> 00:31:39,066
You're not leaving town
with those supplies.

539
00:31:39,067 --> 00:31:42,173
Don't get yourself killed
doing something stupid, Jake.

540
00:31:42,823 --> 00:31:44,606
I don't want that
on my conscience.

541
00:31:47,748 --> 00:31:49,148
You don't have it in you.

542
00:32:09,756 --> 00:32:10,790
Open it.

543
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:28,033
Step... back.

544
00:32:33,874 --> 00:32:34,881
My God.

545
00:32:34,882 --> 00:32:37,407
- This has been here the whole time?
- It is not armed,

546
00:32:37,408 --> 00:32:39,056
and the lead blocks
all the radiation...

547
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:41,154
- You brought that into our house?!
- D...

548
00:32:48,065 --> 00:32:50,415
We were almost out of here,
and you told him, Maggie?

549
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:51,615
He figured it out.

550
00:32:51,982 --> 00:32:53,715
He heard the fireworks
on the radio.

551
00:32:53,882 --> 00:32:55,748
- So what do we do with him now?
- What do you mean?

552
00:32:55,749 --> 00:32:56,865
Let's just leave.

553
00:32:56,998 --> 00:32:58,008
And what...

554
00:32:58,707 --> 00:33:01,274
wait for him to tell the whole town
when we're half a mile out?

555
00:33:01,352 --> 00:33:03,068
It'll be Greenville
all over again.

556
00:33:03,151 --> 00:33:04,334
We're not killers.

557
00:33:04,351 --> 00:33:06,801
I was a P. E. teacher
who saw too many movies.

558
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:08,393
Now I'm a marine.

559
00:33:08,443 --> 00:33:09,443
I'm adapting.

560
00:33:09,476 --> 00:33:11,926
- No.
- It's him or us.

561
00:33:12,383 --> 00:33:13,383
I vote for you.

562
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,467
You know, ammunition
being in such short supply,

563
00:33:20,468 --> 00:33:22,183
I doubt those weapons
are even loaded.

564
00:33:22,184 --> 00:33:23,784
You want to take that chance?

565
00:33:24,184 --> 00:33:25,884
I know damn well this one is.

566
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,034
Son of a... bitch!

567
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,300
Get your hands up!
Get them up!

568
00:33:36,505 --> 00:33:37,522
Get up.

569
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:40,005
How dare you wear
that uniform!

570
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:42,222
It's not a uniform...
it's a costume.

571
00:33:42,322 --> 00:33:44,489
Half the towns we go through
don't even fly the flag.

572
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:47,053
Wait. Everything you said
about the war, North Korea,

573
00:33:47,054 --> 00:33:48,063
it was all a lie?

574
00:33:48,064 --> 00:33:49,879
Some of it we heard,
some we made up.

575
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:51,879
It's anybody's guess what's really
going on out there.

576
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,404
Well, we still have laws
in Jericho,

577
00:33:53,405 --> 00:33:56,210
and tomorrow I'm going to let the town
decide what to do with you.

578
00:33:56,677 --> 00:33:57,810
We can't do that, Gray.

579
00:33:57,876 --> 00:33:59,060
The hell we can't!

580
00:33:59,251 --> 00:34:00,976
People need to know
what we're up against.

581
00:34:00,993 --> 00:34:02,001
Not like this.

582
00:34:02,002 --> 00:34:03,326
Well, they're going to find out
eventually.

583
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:04,443
Yeah, they will.

584
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,609
And by then, the worst
of it will be over.

585
00:34:06,692 --> 00:34:08,176
But food's not enough.

586
00:34:08,317 --> 00:34:09,734
You said it yourself.

587
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:11,592
Without some "X" factor,

588
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:13,938
we don't make it through the winter.
Well, this is it.

589
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:16,802
People need faith
just as much as they need food.

590
00:34:17,202 --> 00:34:19,085
And what the hell
do we do with them?

591
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,360
Then we give a hero's exit.

592
00:34:30,093 --> 00:34:31,127
Ooh-rah.

593
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,627
How can I be sure
you won't follow me?

594
00:34:33,726 --> 00:34:34,760
I won't follow you.

595
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:38,113
Not if I take your son with me,
you won't.

596
00:34:38,437 --> 00:34:39,246
My God.

597
00:34:39,247 --> 00:34:41,331
I'll leave him
just outside of town.

598
00:34:42,098 --> 00:34:43,098
No!

599
00:34:50,284 --> 00:34:52,606
- Dad!
- Allie, get them out of here!

600
00:35:52,077 --> 00:35:54,006
- You okay?
- I'm fine, Dad.

601
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,977
- I'm sorry.
- Dad...

602
00:35:55,978 --> 00:35:57,607
I'm fine.

603
00:36:05,312 --> 00:36:06,531
Let me take this.

604
00:36:13,496 --> 00:36:15,290
You are not fine.

605
00:36:16,805 --> 00:36:18,653
Robert, we are not fine!

606
00:36:19,764 --> 00:36:21,813
How long till-till
more people come after you?

607
00:36:22,008 --> 00:36:23,307
Huh, after us?

608
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,472
- Come on, D, we're safe here.
- Don't...!

609
00:36:29,241 --> 00:36:30,673
We'll never be safe with you.

610
00:36:30,927 --> 00:36:32,133
Come on.

611
00:36:37,985 --> 00:36:38,989
Let's go.

612
00:36:41,747 --> 00:36:42,872
Let's go.

613
00:36:46,261 --> 00:36:47,359
I love you, Dad.

614
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:51,832
I love you, too, baby girl.

615
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,073
Move out! Let's go!

616
00:37:29,694 --> 00:37:31,595
Our own personal escort
out of town?

617
00:37:32,827 --> 00:37:34,100
Look, you're a smart girl,

618
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,456
you need to get out
before these guys get you killed.

619
00:37:36,457 --> 00:37:37,461
And go where?

620
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:39,850
Towns aren't taking refugees,

621
00:37:39,851 --> 00:37:41,926
and there's only one thing
they want women for.

622
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:44,068
Stay here... all right,
you'll be safe.

623
00:37:44,282 --> 00:37:46,871
It's not going to work.
Not after the story we told.

624
00:37:58,576 --> 00:37:59,581
Not now, Mimi.

625
00:37:59,582 --> 00:38:01,629
Like hell not now, Cornhusker.

626
00:38:01,837 --> 00:38:04,328
Cornhuskers are from Nebraska.
I'm a Jayhawk.

627
00:38:07,443 --> 00:38:08,528
What? What?

628
00:38:09,198 --> 00:38:11,233
You drive me so crazy,

629
00:38:11,434 --> 00:38:13,872
and you know that
I can't stay here forever, but...

630
00:38:15,131 --> 00:38:16,376
the truth is...

631
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,961
I can't live without you, either.

632
00:38:24,626 --> 00:38:25,644
Really?

633
00:38:25,965 --> 00:38:27,492
Yes, really.

634
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,725
We got enough food to get all of you
a few days down the road.

635
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,698
Hey, how about some water, man?

636
00:40:11,623 --> 00:40:13,056
Make do.

637
00:40:14,462 --> 00:40:16,578
You'll leave your weapons
on the tank,

638
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:18,306
and you will move out.

639
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,074
Do it.

640
00:40:35,701 --> 00:40:36,748
Come on.

641
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,152
Let's go.

642
00:40:50,113 --> 00:40:51,151
Be careful.

643
00:41:02,202 --> 00:41:03,507
What do we do?

644
00:41:05,735 --> 00:41:07,358
We soldier on.

645
00:41:09,586 --> 00:41:10,942
What do we do with that?

646
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:19,765
Got room in your barn?

647
00:41:20,368 --> 00:41:21,523
Seriously?

648
00:41:21,992 --> 00:41:23,147
Why not.

649
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:26,227
Never know when
you might need a tank.

650
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:41,529
