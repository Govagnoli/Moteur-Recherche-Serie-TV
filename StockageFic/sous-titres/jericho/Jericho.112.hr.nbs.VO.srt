1
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:34,935
Nice planes.

2
00:00:35,126 --> 00:00:37,682
Yeah, every aircraft
we operate is augmented

3
00:00:37,683 --> 00:00:39,724
with custom security
and design features

4
00:00:39,725 --> 00:00:41,653
you won't find
in any other fleet.

5
00:00:46,343 --> 00:00:48,311
I see that you're
an Embry-Riddle grad.

6
00:00:48,446 --> 00:00:52,189
ATP-certified,
1,600 verified FAA hours.

7
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,157
Clearly well qualified,
Mr. Green.

8
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:55,546
Flying's in my blood.

9
00:00:55,758 --> 00:00:58,536
I started working on my Grandpa's
crop duster when I was 10.

10
00:00:58,823 --> 00:01:00,269
Now you understand
that we charter

11
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,955
exclusively
to top executives

12
00:01:01,956 --> 00:01:04,436
and celebrity clients,
so absolute discretion

13
00:01:04,437 --> 00:01:05,864
is a must for our flight crew.

14
00:01:06,126 --> 00:01:07,651
Hey, anything past
getting the plane

15
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:08,845
safely from "A to "B"

16
00:01:08,846 --> 00:01:09,933
is none of my business.

17
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:11,843
Good, of course, finding
out everything we can

18
00:01:11,844 --> 00:01:14,400
about the people who are piloting
our planes is our business.

19
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:15,858
And according
to your visa records,

20
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:18,635
you spent a little time in the
Middle East over the last few years.

21
00:01:18,636 --> 00:01:20,585
14 months in Afghanistan, 6 in Iraq.

22
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:22,209
But you were never military?

23
00:01:22,673 --> 00:01:24,487
I worked for an
independent contractor.

24
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,146
Left that off the resum.

25
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:27,516
I didn't think
it was relevant.

26
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:30,524
State Department has you
flagged as a person of interest.

27
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:32,020
I'm an interesting guy.

28
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,534
There was an incident.

29
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:39,235
I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

30
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,895
Which contractor
were you working with

31
00:01:40,896 --> 00:01:42,448
when this
incident occurred?

32
00:01:42,449 --> 00:01:43,508
One of the big ones.

33
00:01:43,585 --> 00:01:46,257
- Halliburton, Blackwater?
- You said discretion was a must.

34
00:01:48,323 --> 00:01:51,486
Look, I'm going to be straight with you.
I think there's room in our operation

35
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:53,194
for someone like you,
but there is no way

36
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:55,599
that I can hire you if you
are unable to clear this up.

37
00:01:56,795 --> 00:01:57,933
Do you understand that?

38
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:02,679
Thank you for your time.

39
00:02:15,797 --> 00:02:18,633
<i>The president is scheduled
to address the nation tomorrow</i>

40
00:02:18,634 --> 00:02:20,041
<i>amid growing disapproval.</i>

41
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:23,032
<i>Recent polls show his rating
plunging double digits</i>

42
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:25,597
<i>into the 20s,
even amongst partisan voters.</i>

43
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,009
<i>With midterm elections
on the horizon,</i>

44
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:30,478
<i>this is not a good sign
for the administration.</i>

45
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,473
I've already been
summoned, Sarah.

46
00:02:39,842 --> 00:02:41,193
They want me in position.

47
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:42,968
This is good news.

48
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:47,174
We talking locally
or back to the farmland?

49
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,428
I'm waiting to hear.

50
00:02:49,644 --> 00:02:51,303
Congratulations.

51
00:02:54,447 --> 00:02:56,087
It was your idea.

52
00:02:58,026 --> 00:02:59,396
I have to say that...

53
00:03:00,274 --> 00:03:01,267
when they recruited me,

54
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:03,872
I thought I was prepared
for just about anything.

55
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,524
But nothing like this.

56
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,591
Well, that's because
nothing like this...

57
00:03:10,784 --> 00:03:12,559
has ever happened before.

58
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:19,928
This is it.

59
00:03:23,575 --> 00:03:24,404
Yes.

60
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:44,315
This is the moment
we've prepared for.

61
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,804
All the devices
have been secured.

62
00:03:48,154 --> 00:03:51,164
The other cells are receiving
their instructions as we speak.

63
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:54,155
The target cities
have been confirmed.

64
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:57,984
Your routes have been scouted
and cleared.

65
00:04:00,088 --> 00:04:01,052
We're ready.

66
00:04:01,727 --> 00:04:05,199
The strike will go off tomorrow
at precisely 8:05 Eastern.

67
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:08,335
Take a look around you,
gentlemen.

68
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:15,346
These are the faces of the men
who will change the world.

Transcript: swsub.com

[ www.seriessub.com ]

72
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:50,466
- Hey, Dad, you got a second?
- Nope.

73
00:04:50,552 --> 00:04:52,057
USA Today's having a contest

74
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,410
to find the top five
towns under 5,000.

75
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:56,320
I was thinking we
should submit Jericho.

76
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:58,628
Why, so some big
developer can come in

77
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:59,873
and start buying
the town up,

78
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:02,336
maybe turn Main Street
into a strip mall

79
00:05:02,337 --> 00:05:04,069
with a half a dozen
coffee shops or so?

80
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,755
Dad, there are worse things in the world

81
00:05:05,756 --> 00:05:07,553
- than vente frappuccinos.
- Speak English.

82
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:08,981
This could be a good thing.

83
00:05:09,116 --> 00:05:11,739
The kind of headlines
that will bring out voters next month.

84
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:15,289
Son, I am not worried
about beating Gray Anderson.

85
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,484
The people of this town

86
00:05:16,485 --> 00:05:18,260
have kept me in office
for over 20 years.

87
00:05:18,261 --> 00:05:19,590
I will earn their votes

88
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:21,751
by doing the job
they hired me to do.

89
00:05:22,561 --> 00:05:24,240
What are you guys doing here?

90
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,574
Your father missed
his checkup this morning

91
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:28,465
and April was nice enough

92
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:29,941
to take off
her lunch hour

93
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:31,426
to make a house call.

94
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:33,780
Well, sorry, Doc, but we're
gonna have to reschedule

95
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:36,093
- for sometime after the election.
- Johnston.

96
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:38,718
You're gonna do this
whether you like it or not.

97
00:05:39,026 --> 00:05:40,685
I've had this terrible cold

98
00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:43,000
and you've not been feeling
well for almost a week.

99
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:44,061
It's a bad one.

100
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:45,829
Half my staff
has come down with it.

101
00:05:48,742 --> 00:05:50,247
Do you want to strip here

102
00:05:50,248 --> 00:05:52,620
or would you like to go
somewhere a little less public?

103
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,334
My office.

104
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:56,162
That's my guy.

105
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:10,227
Yo, yo, how'd it go?

106
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:11,327
Well, Freddy...

107
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:13,024
so much for your lucky tie.

108
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,423
"Driver wanted.
Military experience.

109
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,763
Plus, travel opportunities."

110
00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:21,115
Something tells me they're not
talking about the Bahamas.

111
00:06:21,116 --> 00:06:21,908
I need a job.

112
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,200
You're no driver, man.

113
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,284
You're a pilot,
a freakin' good one.

114
00:06:27,191 --> 00:06:28,928
Right now, all I am is broke.

115
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,706
Unless you want
to pay my rent for me.

116
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:33,026
Sorry?!

117
00:06:33,296 --> 00:06:34,685
Tell you what I can do, though.

118
00:06:34,743 --> 00:06:35,940
Set you up with a drink.

119
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,140
Oye! Mira!

120
00:06:40,513 --> 00:06:42,210
Hit us up with a couple
of cervezas.

121
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:43,696
What's up with you
and the manners?

122
00:06:43,697 --> 00:06:45,876
I know you didn't just whistle
for me like some dog.

123
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:47,709
- Oh, baby...
- Don't you "baby" me, baby.

124
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,078
You're the worst
tipper in here.

125
00:06:49,135 --> 00:06:51,296
What, that ring on your finger,
that don't count?

126
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:58,490
Finally pulled
the trigger, Freddy?

127
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:00,593
- All right.
- You know it, baby.

128
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:04,567
Hey, she's got some
good-looking sisters.

129
00:07:05,318 --> 00:07:08,135
Unless you're still all hung up
on that farm girl back in Iowa.

130
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:09,350
- Kansas.
- Same thing.

131
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:10,547
No, not the same thing.

132
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:17,742
Yeah. Hold on a second.

133
00:07:17,858 --> 00:07:19,170
Don't go anywhere,
all right?

134
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,670
Where am I gonna go?

135
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:39,565
<i>Sarah, the schedule's changed.</i>

136
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:42,032
It's happening tomorrow
during the President's address.

137
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:43,357
<i>I'll be there as soon as I can,</i>

138
00:07:43,358 --> 00:07:45,208
but there's something
I need to take care of.

139
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:47,992
You get everything together
and I'll meet you back as soon as I can.

140
00:07:47,993 --> 00:07:48,909
Where are you going?

141
00:07:49,064 --> 00:07:50,241
<i>To get my kids.</i>

142
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:52,469
<i>Robert, there isn't enough time.</i>

143
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:54,802
Robert!

144
00:08:08,595 --> 00:08:09,329
Anna.

145
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,746
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

146
00:08:13,747 --> 00:08:14,595
He's a good man.

147
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,311
I don't know
how good he his, but...

148
00:08:16,312 --> 00:08:17,720
he promised to take care of me.

149
00:08:18,385 --> 00:08:20,701
- Call me crazy, I believe him.
- What's this?

150
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:22,591
My best man hitting
on my fiance?

151
00:08:22,774 --> 00:08:23,661
Best man?

152
00:08:23,932 --> 00:08:25,147
You gonna make me ask?

153
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,119
You're more a brother to me
than the one I grew up with.

154
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,774
Back at ya.

155
00:08:29,004 --> 00:08:29,968
I'm happy to do it.

156
00:08:30,238 --> 00:08:32,071
Got some more good news, too.

157
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,463
Uh, sweetie, will you...

158
00:08:35,926 --> 00:08:37,585
will you give us
a moment to talk?

159
00:08:46,923 --> 00:08:48,949
What if I told you
I got a gig lined up?

160
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:52,036
Eight weeks,
a hundred G's, all cash.

161
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:53,000
What kind of gig?

162
00:08:53,174 --> 00:08:54,100
The kind we're good at.

163
00:08:54,506 --> 00:08:56,145
Cargo run.
Quick in, quick out.

164
00:08:56,146 --> 00:08:58,152
$30,000 up front,
$70,000 when it's done.

165
00:08:59,309 --> 00:08:59,907
Where?

166
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:02,145
Afghanistan.

167
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,927
- No.
- Come on.

168
00:09:06,448 --> 00:09:08,628
You've been looking
for work for what, six months?

169
00:09:09,043 --> 00:09:11,417
We do this one gig
and we are set.

170
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:14,326
You could open that flight school.
Maybe go home, snag back that girl.

171
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:15,792
Why are you doing this to me?

172
00:09:16,795 --> 00:09:18,030
I can't believe you'd even ask

173
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:19,766
after what we saw over there,
what we did.

174
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,734
All we did was
not get killed, J.

175
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:23,278
Innocent people died, Freddy.

176
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:24,551
Innocent people.

177
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,848
I see it every time
I close my eyes.

178
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:28,487
Which isn't too damn often
these days.

179
00:09:28,617 --> 00:09:30,654
Well, we'll be smarter
this time, man.

180
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:32,383
You know that I got
your back, man.

181
00:09:32,387 --> 00:09:33,487
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:37,355
You're on your own this time.
I can't go back there.

183
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,383
I'll tell you what, Jerry,

184
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:45,081
you agree
to sit down face to face,

185
00:09:45,082 --> 00:09:47,357
I'll flip you a pair of
open day boxes at Wrigley.

186
00:09:48,303 --> 00:09:49,306
No strings.

187
00:09:49,653 --> 00:09:51,274
I swear on a stack
of cheddar dogs.

188
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:53,473
Great.

189
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:55,711
6:00 at The Pump Room.

190
00:09:56,424 --> 00:09:57,080
See you there.

191
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:00,303
Chicago again?

192
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,194
Hey, teach, half day?

193
00:10:03,351 --> 00:10:05,744
Feel like helping me
prepare a syllabus or...

194
00:10:05,782 --> 00:10:08,290
grading 30 essays on
Orwell's Animal Farm?

195
00:10:08,445 --> 00:10:10,490
No, I have a better idea.

196
00:10:10,491 --> 00:10:13,268
Have a sub do that and come
to Chicago with me tonight.

197
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:15,911
That would send
a great message to my students.

198
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:17,608
I'll write a letter for you.

199
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:20,521
"Dear kids, sorry I can't teach
you ungrateful brats today.

200
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:23,966
"I'm with my fiance getting drunk
on draft beer and having

201
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,493
tons of Chicago-style sex."

202
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:28,885
I think it's Chicago-style pizza.

203
00:10:30,294 --> 00:10:31,104
That, too.

204
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:34,248
One night.

205
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:35,888
Your students will catch up.

206
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:43,220
Book it.

207
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:44,763
Seriously?

208
00:10:45,332 --> 00:10:47,762
You're not going to try
to talk me out of it now, are you?

209
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:50,164
No. I'm done talking.

210
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:55,247
<i>46 tackles, three sacks</i>

211
00:10:55,248 --> 00:10:56,791
<i>and a couple of interceptions...</i>

212
00:11:16,553 --> 00:11:17,190
You all right?

213
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:21,608
I'm worried
about Freddy.

214
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:23,075
You want a beer?

215
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:24,044
No.

216
00:11:24,773 --> 00:11:26,822
I think he's in over
his head with something.

217
00:11:28,323 --> 00:11:29,577
What are you talking about?

218
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:32,046
These guys started
coming around.

219
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:33,493
Like...

220
00:11:33,763 --> 00:11:35,172
soldiers but not.

221
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:37,447
They, they came by
again after you left.

222
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,010
Well, he's a big boy.

223
00:11:39,144 --> 00:11:40,803
He can hang out
with whoever he chooses.

224
00:11:40,804 --> 00:11:41,710
It's not like that.

225
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,018
When he came back,

226
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:45,501
Freddy had a black eye, saying
he's going away for two months

227
00:11:45,502 --> 00:11:46,587
and not to try to find him.

228
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:47,980
Tell him you don't want him to go.

229
00:11:47,981 --> 00:11:49,103
You don't think I did that?

230
00:11:49,104 --> 00:11:50,886
He says he doesn't
have a choice,

231
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:52,087
that he's doing it for me.

232
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,909
What do you want me to do?

233
00:11:54,698 --> 00:11:55,450
Help him.

234
00:11:57,732 --> 00:11:59,407
Go with him if you have to.

235
00:12:01,905 --> 00:12:03,776
I know what he did for you
in Iraq.

236
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:07,400
I know you owe him your life.

237
00:12:09,549 --> 00:12:10,497
Yeah.

238
00:12:10,723 --> 00:12:13,491
That doesn't appear to be
worth very much, right now.

239
00:12:16,998 --> 00:12:18,060
I'm pregnant, Jake.

240
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:20,695
I just...

241
00:12:21,504 --> 00:12:23,603
I have a bad feeling
about all this.

242
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,317
- Robert, what...
- Don't make a scene.

243
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:43,701
What are you doing here?

244
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,919
You need to come with me.

245
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,778
Look, don't tell me
what to do.

246
00:12:47,422 --> 00:12:49,748
You are not allowed
within 500 feet of this family.

247
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,816
Circumstances have changed, Darcy.

248
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,163
Mom!

249
00:12:53,754 --> 00:12:54,202
Mom.

250
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,579
Oh, my God. The kids.

251
00:13:02,107 --> 00:13:03,452
Unlock the door from the inside.

252
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:05,177
Alison, it's, it's okay.
It's okay.

253
00:13:08,518 --> 00:13:09,994
You let them out of there right now,

254
00:13:09,995 --> 00:13:11,514
or so help me,
I'll start screaming.

255
00:13:11,515 --> 00:13:13,061
No, you listen to me
very carefully.

256
00:13:13,062 --> 00:13:14,856
In five seconds,
I'm getting on this truck

257
00:13:14,857 --> 00:13:16,438
and I am leaving
Washington for good.

258
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,104
And I did not come here
to discuss this with you.

259
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,684
Now you can
either trust me,

260
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,771
and come with us
or you can stay here.

261
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:28,838
But you will never ever
see your children again.

262
00:13:48,219 --> 00:13:49,473
Hey, buddy, you in?

263
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:50,765
I'm in.

264
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:52,264
Glad you changed your mind.

265
00:13:52,434 --> 00:13:53,206
I'm telling you,

266
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,116
this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

267
00:13:55,117 --> 00:13:57,865
Then how come this isn't the first time
I've heard you say that?

268
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,620
Do me a favor.

269
00:14:00,276 --> 00:14:02,148
Skip ahead in your mind
a couple of months.

270
00:14:02,978 --> 00:14:04,695
Visualize yourself on a...

271
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,316
Mexican beach,

272
00:14:06,587 --> 00:14:08,863
knee deep in bikinis
and Benjamins.

273
00:14:09,037 --> 00:14:10,928
I try not to think
that far ahead.

274
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,841
Keeps me from being disappointed
when things go to hell.

275
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,211
My pop once told me

276
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,506
if you don't keep an eye
towards where you're going,

277
00:14:17,507 --> 00:14:18,568
you'll never get there.

278
00:14:19,146 --> 00:14:20,381
Speaking of eyes...

279
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,214
You should see the other guy.

280
00:14:22,349 --> 00:14:23,468
Fine, introduce us.

281
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,326
Who's the job for, Freddy?

282
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,272
Don't matter who.

283
00:14:28,523 --> 00:14:30,259
They know you, and
your reputation.

284
00:14:30,395 --> 00:14:32,652
I'm not going anywhere
until I know.

285
00:14:36,763 --> 00:14:38,191
It's an offshoot of Ravenwood.

286
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,486
You'll meet 'em, tomorrow

287
00:14:40,487 --> 00:14:42,493
right before we get on a plane.
In the meantime,

288
00:14:42,628 --> 00:14:44,094
all you gotta worry about...

289
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:46,738
is this.

290
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,233
There's three times that
waiting for you

291
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:52,140
when this is over.

292
00:14:52,246 --> 00:14:53,046
All we gotta do is

293
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:55,806
run a convoy through enemy territory
without getting killed.

294
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:58,995
How many times I gotta get your back
before you start believing it, huh?

295
00:15:58,392 --> 00:15:59,260
Seat's all yours.

296
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,437
Thank you.

297
00:16:01,005 --> 00:16:03,436
Yeah, I hate, I hate sitting when
I got money on a game.

298
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,023
<i>Swung on, it's a high
blast out toward left field.</i>

299
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:09,261
<i>It's way back, and it is gone!</i>

300
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:14,190
Mary Bailey, you owe me five bucks.

301
00:16:14,191 --> 00:16:15,174
Pay up!

302
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:18,202
Better yet, better yet.
Buy my, uh,

303
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,134
good luck charm here,
a drink on me.

304
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,315
Don't waste your money,
I have an expense account.

305
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,743
What is your best wine?

306
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,170
Beer.

307
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,007
Vodka, rocks.

308
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:33,040
Did you know that it
is a three-hour cab ride

309
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,047
from the airport to
this godforsaken town?

310
00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:36,181
Scenic, though, ain't it?

311
00:16:36,813 --> 00:16:37,952
If you like corn.

312
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,688
Well, now,
who doesn't like corn?

313
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,045
I mean, you got
corn on the cob,

314
00:16:43,411 --> 00:16:45,360
cornflakes, corn nuts,

315
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,733
corn dogs, cornsicles.

316
00:16:48,023 --> 00:16:49,142
Cornsicles?

317
00:16:51,881 --> 00:16:52,749
It's a joke, lady.

318
00:16:53,636 --> 00:16:55,295
Can you not talk
to me, please?

319
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:56,858
Thank you.

320
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:02,839
- Corn, corn chips?
- Seriously.

321
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:04,325
Don't talk to me.

322
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:05,714
Bailey's.

323
00:17:05,945 --> 00:17:06,775
<i>Hey, there.</i>

324
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:07,957
Hi.

325
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:10,378
Am I going to see you this week?

326
00:17:10,513 --> 00:17:11,999
<i>Well, you can see me right now.</i>

327
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:13,755
<i>Just turn around.</i>

328
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:19,215
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

329
00:17:19,562 --> 00:17:20,488
You have no idea

330
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:22,379
<i>how badly I want
to kiss you right now.</i>

331
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:23,923
Well.

332
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,910
<i>Why don't you step
into my office?</i>

333
00:17:33,935 --> 00:17:35,208
What in the...

334
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:37,311
heck do we have here?

335
00:17:37,977 --> 00:17:40,022
It's time for some changes, Johnston.

336
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:41,507
Starting with your diet.

337
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,112
A man can't live on that.

338
00:17:44,671 --> 00:17:46,562
Can if he wants to
stay married to me.

339
00:17:48,607 --> 00:17:52,079
Your blood pressure was ten
points over your last checkup.

340
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,798
Well, that's just the stress.
It's always up at election time.

341
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,265
Then drop out of the race.

342
00:17:56,631 --> 00:17:58,001
What has gotten into you?

343
00:17:58,252 --> 00:18:01,435
Something happened watching April
listen to your heartbeat.

344
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:03,419
I began to wonder.

345
00:18:03,743 --> 00:18:05,963
How many good years do
we have left together?

346
00:18:05,964 --> 00:18:07,266
Did you hear something I didn't?

347
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:09,463
'Cause all she told me was
I might be getting a cold.

348
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:10,052
This isn't,

349
00:18:10,418 --> 00:18:12,888
this isn't just about health,
yours or mine.

350
00:18:13,215 --> 00:18:15,897
When you first took office
you made two oaths.

351
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:17,672
One to the people
of this town,

352
00:18:17,962 --> 00:18:19,255
and the other one to me.

353
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,477
Do you rember
what you said?

354
00:18:23,093 --> 00:18:23,576
Yeah.

355
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,299
That I would never let the job
come before you and the kids.

356
00:18:28,746 --> 00:18:30,656
I'm just asking
for equal time.

357
00:18:31,814 --> 00:18:33,203
I hear you, honey.

358
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:44,220
You all stay put.

359
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:46,304
Mom, do something.

360
00:18:46,632 --> 00:18:48,523
Robert, let us go.

361
00:18:48,986 --> 00:18:49,970
Please, I'm begging you.

362
00:18:50,105 --> 00:18:51,416
I'll be back
in five minutes.

363
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:52,709
- And then what?
- And then...

364
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:53,481
we leave town.

365
00:18:53,577 --> 00:18:55,873
Oh, you're crazy,
I'm not going anywhere with you.

366
00:18:57,021 --> 00:18:58,468
Dad, stop. Dad!

367
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:00,030
Let go of her,
Robert!

368
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,458
Listen to me, okay.

369
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:04,116
I would never do
anything to hurt you,

370
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:06,046
your mother, or your brother.

371
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:07,010
You believe me?

372
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:09,904
Do you believe me?

373
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:12,026
I barely know you.

374
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:14,360
Listen, Robert,
you are scaring Samuel.

375
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,768
Unscare him, Darcy.

376
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:34,769
Do you have your cell phone?

377
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,352
No, he took it when
he picked me up.

378
00:19:37,818 --> 00:19:38,802
Not mine.

379
00:19:38,937 --> 00:19:40,905
Really?
Where is it, honey?

380
00:19:41,001 --> 00:19:42,062
In my backpack.

381
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:48,969
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

382
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,805
The door was unlocked.

383
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,204
I love what you've done
with the place.

384
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:10,500
What do you want, Agent Hicks?

385
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:12,175
Guess whose name
just popped up

386
00:20:12,271 --> 00:20:14,335
on an international
passenger manifest?

387
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:16,110
You got me on
a no-fly list now?

388
00:20:17,441 --> 00:20:19,428
No, not yet, but...

389
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:20,991
I thought maybe...

390
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:23,152
we could work out a deal.

391
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:30,658
You're about to get into bed
with some very bad people, Jake.

392
00:20:31,255 --> 00:20:33,339
Lucky for you,
your timing is perfect.

393
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,252
We're looking to nail Ravenwood.

394
00:20:36,714 --> 00:20:37,428
They did that?

395
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,274
They've been running weapons
since the start of the war.

396
00:20:40,563 --> 00:20:43,303
They'll sell arms to anybody,
even our enemies.

397
00:20:43,896 --> 00:20:46,212
We need someone working for us

398
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,832
that they'll
consider credible.

399
00:20:48,507 --> 00:20:50,050
And why would I
say yes to you?

400
00:20:51,227 --> 00:20:52,018
Because...

401
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:56,552
...you know firsthand
what they're capable of.

402
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,469
Sarah, come on, we don't have...

403
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:12,258
Sarah?

404
00:21:55,686 --> 00:21:56,728
Hold it right there.

405
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,426
Drop the case.

406
00:22:00,182 --> 00:22:02,150
Walk towards me slowly.

407
00:22:02,825 --> 00:22:04,504
Put your hands in the air... now!

408
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:08,246
This your truck?

409
00:22:10,272 --> 00:22:10,966
It's a rental.

410
00:22:11,043 --> 00:22:12,085
Moving day, you know?

411
00:22:12,587 --> 00:22:13,841
What seems to
be the problem?

412
00:22:14,034 --> 00:22:14,922
Open the back.

413
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,195
Okay.

414
00:22:23,121 --> 00:22:24,008
What the hell?

415
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:26,883
Cuff him.

416
00:22:28,002 --> 00:22:29,179
Hands behind your back.

417
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,403
Help! Help!
Unlock the door.

418
00:22:33,481 --> 00:22:34,444
- Please.
- It's okay.

419
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:35,758
We're gonna get you out of here.

420
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:37,378
- Can you open this door?
- We can't.

421
00:22:37,395 --> 00:22:38,398
Can you unlock the door.

422
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:38,996
Watch out!

423
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,689
- Here, Mayor Green.
- Thank you, Mary.

424
00:22:44,084 --> 00:22:44,721
Hey, Dad.

425
00:22:44,837 --> 00:22:45,782
- Hey, Eric.
- Mary.

426
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:48,425
Oh, darlin', would you get him
a beer, too?

427
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:49,641
Sure thing.

428
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:50,675
Thanks.

429
00:22:57,446 --> 00:22:58,198
So, um...

430
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:00,745
Why did I ask you here?

431
00:23:00,918 --> 00:23:02,076
Yeah. Is everything okay?

432
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:03,716
Uh, your mother and I have been...

433
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:06,070
talking about the next
chapter in our lives.

434
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:07,477
Be more accurate, she's...

435
00:23:07,573 --> 00:23:10,814
pointing out how I seem to be
unwilling to turn the page.

436
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:12,588
Sounds like Mom.

437
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:18,165
When I first took office,
you were in... what? Third grade?

438
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,071
Second.

439
00:23:19,554 --> 00:23:21,672
My team won the pee-wee
football trophy that year.

440
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:25,222
I scored two touchdowns
in the championship game.

441
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:27,614
Hard to remember
back that far.

442
00:23:27,804 --> 00:23:29,810
Maybe because
you didn't make the game, Dad.

443
00:23:30,698 --> 00:23:31,238
Right.

444
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,730
Well,

445
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,910
your mother is afraid that if I keep

446
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:38,800
going the way I'm going,
we're gonna wind up

447
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:40,344
missing more than
pee-wee football.

448
00:23:41,464 --> 00:23:42,920
And I've been
thinking about it,

449
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:45,524
and I want to ask
you a question.

450
00:23:49,046 --> 00:23:51,457
If I decided to drop
out of the race,

451
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,309
would you consider
running in my place?

452
00:23:55,026 --> 00:23:55,605
What?

453
00:23:57,527 --> 00:23:59,939
You'd make a good candidate, son.

454
00:24:00,363 --> 00:24:02,562
You've been here
your whole life, you live clean,

455
00:24:02,563 --> 00:24:04,029
unlike your brother Jake.

456
00:24:04,453 --> 00:24:06,112
Plus, selfishly, I'd get to...

457
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:09,604
step down and still have some influence
over how things were run.

458
00:24:09,826 --> 00:24:11,099
Oh, y-you're serious?

459
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:12,006
Well, you...

460
00:24:12,527 --> 00:24:14,244
You're smart, you're decisive.

461
00:24:14,726 --> 00:24:16,192
Even got yourself a law degree.

462
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:17,813
Which I plan on using some day.

463
00:24:19,144 --> 00:24:20,861
Plan on doing a lot
of things some day.

464
00:24:21,382 --> 00:24:23,080
Nothing you've
been sharing with me.

465
00:24:25,642 --> 00:24:27,378
Let me know if you
need anything else.

466
00:24:28,806 --> 00:24:30,678
So, you take the night
and think about it.

467
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:31,855
Talk to April about it.

468
00:24:32,376 --> 00:24:33,668
It's gonna effect her, too.

469
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:35,366
Yeah.

470
00:24:42,962 --> 00:24:43,348
Hey.

471
00:24:43,923 --> 00:24:45,293
- What's up?
- We need to talk.

472
00:24:48,129 --> 00:24:48,766
What's up?

473
00:24:49,267 --> 00:24:50,965
Cargo, we're transporting
for Ravenwood,

474
00:24:50,966 --> 00:24:52,161
you have any idea what it is?

475
00:24:52,162 --> 00:24:53,864
I don't ask those kind
of questions, man.

476
00:24:53,865 --> 00:24:55,018
Stinger Missiles. RPGs.

477
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:57,605
It's not like this was ever some
kind of humanitarian mission.

478
00:24:57,606 --> 00:24:59,731
They've been selling them
to the insurgents, Freddie

479
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:01,654
They'll be used to kill our own guys!

480
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,677
The Feds are on
to the whole thing.

481
00:25:03,992 --> 00:25:05,720
They want us to help
take down Ravenwood.

482
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:07,281
Whoa. Are you crazy?

483
00:25:07,282 --> 00:25:09,145
We don't have a choice.
They're watching us.

484
00:25:09,146 --> 00:25:10,046
So is Ravenwood, man.

485
00:25:10,047 --> 00:25:12,049
I'm more worried about them
than the government.

486
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,350
If we don't work with the Feds,

487
00:25:13,351 --> 00:25:15,259
they'll make sure
Ravenwood believes you are.

488
00:25:23,498 --> 00:25:25,102
- You got your money with you?
- What?

489
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:26,847
- Your money.
- Yeah, I can get it.

490
00:25:26,848 --> 00:25:29,167
Get Anna, grab whatever you can,
we'll meet in an hour.

491
00:25:29,168 --> 00:25:30,802
- Then what?
- We'll take off tonight.

492
00:25:30,803 --> 00:25:33,175
If they come after us, at least
we'll have a head start.

493
00:25:33,672 --> 00:25:34,270
All right?

494
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,646
Nobody from school
better see us.

495
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,849
Gonna make it pretty hard for me
to get on that plane tonight

496
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:44,891
and call in sick tomorrow.

497
00:25:44,892 --> 00:25:47,214
You know, if this was Chicago,
you could walk for miles

498
00:25:47,215 --> 00:25:48,971
without ever running
into anyone you know.

499
00:25:48,972 --> 00:25:50,274
Really? Chicago again?

500
00:25:50,275 --> 00:25:53,476
Plus, there's the pizza,
the Cubs, the culture...

501
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,478
What are you getting at, huh?

502
00:25:55,636 --> 00:25:56,794
Okay, I have a confession.

503
00:25:56,795 --> 00:25:58,535
The meeting tomorrow
isn't just a meeting.

504
00:25:58,536 --> 00:26:00,929
It's an interview for a startup
venture capital firm.

505
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:02,607
Final interview,
actually.

506
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,809
Are you serious?

507
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,375
Well, I thought maybe you could
get to know the city a little.

508
00:26:08,376 --> 00:26:09,687
You might fall in love with it.

509
00:26:10,594 --> 00:26:11,539
You're a jerk.

510
00:26:12,562 --> 00:26:14,491
Emily, we have to at
least talk about it.

511
00:26:14,492 --> 00:26:15,649
We have talked about this.

512
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:18,364
This is not the kind of opportunity
you can just say no to.

513
00:26:18,365 --> 00:26:18,665
Really?

514
00:26:19,472 --> 00:26:19,908
No.

515
00:26:20,024 --> 00:26:21,300
There. How hard is that?

516
00:26:22,034 --> 00:26:23,301
I cannot believe you.

517
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:25,310
We're supposed to be married
in a few months.

518
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:26,738
Why do you think I'm doing this?

519
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:27,770
Because you're selfish,

520
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:29,149
and you don't listen.

521
00:26:29,515 --> 00:26:31,965
I told you when you proposed to me
I didn't want to move.

522
00:26:32,312 --> 00:26:33,991
Now you go behind my back like this?

523
00:26:34,116 --> 00:26:35,707
Yeah, well, screw me for thinking

524
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:37,482
you might be open
to changing your mind.

525
00:26:37,713 --> 00:26:40,241
I mean, what is it about
this town that's got you so...

526
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,189
addicted to it?

527
00:26:43,096 --> 00:26:44,562
This town is my history.

528
00:26:45,526 --> 00:26:47,533
It is everything
that I know and love.

529
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,528
It's where I want
my kids to grow up.

530
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:51,332
If you don't understand that,
then maybe...

531
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:51,971
Maybe what?

532
00:26:55,136 --> 00:26:57,123
I'm not getting on that plane
with you tonight.

533
00:26:58,647 --> 00:27:01,734
If you decide to take that job tomorrow,
then don't bother coming back.

534
00:27:19,155 --> 00:27:20,409
I'm tired.

535
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:28,088
Allison,

536
00:27:28,204 --> 00:27:29,613
there are two bedrooms
upstairs.

537
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:32,583
Take your brother up to the one
on the right. That's where you'll sleep.

538
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,735
Who's stuff is all this?
Who lives here?

539
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:36,760
We do.

540
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,159
Go on upstairs.
I'll be there in a minute.

541
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,416
Come on, Sammy.
I'll read to you.

542
00:27:46,077 --> 00:27:47,679
I don't know what's going on, Robert,

543
00:27:48,219 --> 00:27:49,222
and right now, I'm...

544
00:27:49,956 --> 00:27:51,731
I'm too exhausted to fight,

545
00:27:52,155 --> 00:27:54,065
but I promise you one thing.

546
00:27:54,287 --> 00:27:55,811
Come tomorrow,
one way or another,

547
00:27:55,812 --> 00:27:56,988
I will have you arrested.

548
00:27:57,181 --> 00:27:58,801
But you know, come tomorrow,

549
00:27:59,727 --> 00:28:01,502
a whole lot of things
will be different.

550
00:28:17,574 --> 00:28:18,692
Freddie, come here.

551
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:23,168
- All right. What happened?!
- Ravenwood.

552
00:28:24,152 --> 00:28:25,599
Those sons a bitches shot me!

553
00:28:25,676 --> 00:28:26,447
Oh, God!

554
00:28:26,485 --> 00:28:28,059
Take it easy,
take it easy.

555
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:34,366
Find Anna.

556
00:28:34,576 --> 00:28:35,646
Make sure she's all right.

557
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,417
First, we got to get
you to the hospital.

558
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:39,856
All I care about
is Anna and my kid.

559
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:41,303
Get them on that bus.

560
00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:43,470
Then you get the hell
out of here, too!

561
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,760
They're gonna come after you.

562
00:28:45,572 --> 00:28:46,779
Oh, they're coming after you.

563
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,620
Try to stay with me.

564
00:28:47,621 --> 00:28:48,746
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

565
00:28:48,747 --> 00:28:50,005
I need an ambulance right away.

566
00:28:50,076 --> 00:28:52,080
My friend's been shot,
he's lost a lot of blood.

567
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:52,813
<i>Is he breathing?</i>

568
00:28:53,187 --> 00:28:54,133
Stay with me, Freddie!

569
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:55,270
<i>Sir, is he breathing?</i>

570
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,898
Stay with me, man.

571
00:28:57,561 --> 00:28:58,846
Come on, man, stay with me.

572
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:00,384
You're all right.

573
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:02,862
You're all right.
Stay with me.

574
00:29:05,821 --> 00:29:07,259
I can't believe he's gone.

575
00:29:16,544 --> 00:29:17,603
I'm really sorry.

576
00:29:18,037 --> 00:29:19,396
It's not your fault. You did...

577
00:29:20,068 --> 00:29:21,664
You did everything that you could.

578
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:29,778
I don't want it.

579
00:29:29,994 --> 00:29:30,705
I don't want it.

580
00:29:31,281 --> 00:29:32,395
It belonged to Freddie.

581
00:29:32,672 --> 00:29:33,659
Use it for the baby.

582
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,674
My family will help me.
You keep it.

583
00:29:36,328 --> 00:29:36,700
No.

584
00:29:38,257 --> 00:29:39,166
I promised him.

585
00:29:40,644 --> 00:29:41,703
Just put it away.

586
00:29:45,114 --> 00:29:47,651
<i>Platform for Houston.
Platform six.</i>

587
00:29:47,856 --> 00:29:48,788
You better go.

588
00:29:58,477 --> 00:29:59,299
Come with me.

589
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:02,160
Come on,
you can start over, too.

590
00:30:02,215 --> 00:30:04,183
No, I can't. Not yet.

591
00:30:04,588 --> 00:30:06,073
Then where will you go?

592
00:30:12,615 --> 00:30:13,849
You were up early.

593
00:30:14,177 --> 00:30:15,701
Oh, I've been coughing all night.

594
00:30:15,702 --> 00:30:17,110
I didn't want to wake you.

595
00:30:19,888 --> 00:30:20,756
Paris.

596
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:24,537
I hate France.

597
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,547
I'm sure they'd be
devastated to hear it.

598
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:33,972
Studied French and Italian
for four years.

599
00:30:34,628 --> 00:30:37,020
After all those years,
all I can remember is my name,

600
00:30:37,021 --> 00:30:38,216
how to count to ten and,

601
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,782
"Would you please pass
that packet of sugar?"

602
00:30:45,141 --> 00:30:46,434
Book the trip.

603
00:30:47,939 --> 00:30:51,160
I don't think they take reservations
six years in advance.

604
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,883
I was thinking
more like Christmas.

605
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:57,546
What the hell.
Book one for Italy, too.

606
00:30:58,009 --> 00:30:58,510
<i>Hello.</i>

607
00:30:59,668 --> 00:31:00,305
<i>Hello?</i>

608
00:31:01,887 --> 00:31:03,063
<i>Is anybody there?</i>

609
00:31:03,951 --> 00:31:04,375
<i>Hello?</i>

610
00:31:04,626 --> 00:31:05,378
Jake.

611
00:31:08,311 --> 00:31:09,989
<i>One new message.</i>

612
00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:11,995
Hey, Emily, it's Roger.

613
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:15,062
Just tried your cell,
but I couldn't reach you.

614
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:18,689
Hopefully, you haven't run off
with the milkman yet.

615
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:23,589
Last night was terrible.

616
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:25,364
I kept wanting to...

617
00:31:25,596 --> 00:31:28,799
get up and tell the captain
I'd made a horrible mistake,

618
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,149
and to turn the plane around.

619
00:31:31,403 --> 00:31:33,062
My home is where you are, babe.

620
00:31:34,277 --> 00:31:36,689
And if that means Jericho, Kansas
for the rest of my life,

621
00:31:37,364 --> 00:31:38,251
it'll be a happy one.

622
00:31:40,991 --> 00:31:42,129
I'm flying back tonight.

623
00:31:42,148 --> 00:31:43,711
I get into Wichita at 10:30.

624
00:31:44,984 --> 00:31:46,624
I can't think of anything
I'd rather see

625
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:48,476
than your beautiful face
when I get home.

626
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:51,968
And in case you're wondering, I...

627
00:31:52,296 --> 00:31:53,656
I didn't go on that interview.

628
00:32:23,434 --> 00:32:24,978
Oh, excuse me.

629
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:26,887
Excuse me.

630
00:32:27,023 --> 00:32:28,373
Oh, it's you.

631
00:32:28,605 --> 00:32:29,916
Yeah, sorry, not ringing a bell.

632
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:33,003
Look, I have been standing out
here forever waiting for a cab.

633
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,052
Yeah, I suggest you nicely
ask someone for a ride.

634
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:38,542
Do you know where
the Richmond Farm is?

635
00:32:40,297 --> 00:32:42,362
Well, yeah, I ought to.
I'm Stanley Richmond.

636
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,030
- You got to be kidding.
- No.

637
00:32:50,407 --> 00:32:52,876
You see, now is the part
where you tell me your name.

638
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,478
Mimi Clark.

639
00:32:55,404 --> 00:32:56,504
Really? Well, it's...

640
00:32:57,816 --> 00:32:59,166
nice to meet you, Ms. Clark.

641
00:32:59,302 --> 00:33:00,923
Do you not read your mail?

642
00:33:01,618 --> 00:33:04,088
Nope. Nothing but bills
and bad news. Why?

643
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:06,673
Well, this would be a little of both.

644
00:33:07,117 --> 00:33:08,660
I work for the IRS.

645
00:33:09,663 --> 00:33:10,879
And according to our records,

646
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,715
you owe more than $180,000
in back taxes.

647
00:33:15,431 --> 00:33:17,032
It's nice to meet you.

648
00:33:27,161 --> 00:33:30,614
<i>Mr. Speaker,
the President of the United States.</i>

649
00:33:37,192 --> 00:33:39,989
<i>We all know that
these divisions pale in comparison</i>

650
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:43,211
<i>to the fundamental dangers posed
by the thrt of terrorism.</i>

651
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,045
<i>We have an eternal commitment
to leave the world</i>

652
00:34:33,046 --> 00:34:35,418
<i>a better place for our children
and grandchildren.</i>

653
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:37,444
<i>This has always been our promise.</i>

654
00:34:40,531 --> 00:34:41,592
Not another step.

655
00:34:42,672 --> 00:34:43,637
Where are my kids?

656
00:34:43,965 --> 00:34:44,833
Give me the keys.

657
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,666
Darcy, put that gun down,

658
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,402
'cause you don't even
know how to use it.

659
00:34:48,403 --> 00:34:51,138
I don't want to shoot you, Robert,
but so help me, I'm prepared to!

660
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,111
Now, give me the keys!

661
00:34:52,112 --> 00:34:53,462
<i>Mom! Mom, come quick!</i>

662
00:34:53,463 --> 00:34:54,407
Baby, stay outside!

663
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,453
<i>Mom! Mom!
Something's happening!</i>

664
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:08,294
<i>Woody, what are you looking at?</i>

665
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:34,554
Jake!

666
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:36,020
Jake, we got
to go outside!

667
00:36:36,406 --> 00:36:37,043
Now!

668
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:45,025
<i>Help them.
Help them.</i>

669
00:36:45,623 --> 00:36:46,588
Bring them inside.

670
00:36:48,613 --> 00:36:49,828
Some of them were on planes.

671
00:36:51,352 --> 00:36:52,818
Landed in the middle of nowhere.

672
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,766
Been walking for weeks.

673
00:36:55,982 --> 00:36:57,679
They must have gone through hell.

674
00:37:00,842 --> 00:37:02,598
<i>Can you give me
a hand with this?</i>

675
00:37:07,398 --> 00:37:08,498
Oh, my God.

676
00:37:11,411 --> 00:37:11,932
Roger.

677
00:37:21,443 --> 00:37:22,639
Is it really you?

678
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,161
I thought you were dead.

679
00:37:34,466 --> 00:37:35,913
Come on. Come with me.

680
00:37:44,111 --> 00:37:46,716
We only have another half hour
before the generators shut down.

681
00:37:47,218 --> 00:37:48,917
Well, I'm sure they'll
make an exception.

682
00:37:48,918 --> 00:37:50,190
Do we have any extra blankets?

683
00:37:50,191 --> 00:37:52,716
I already brought everything
down I could find. Listen, Eric,

684
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:54,279
these people need medical attention.

685
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,633
You have to find a doctor.

686
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:01,176
I'm okay.

687
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,992
Are there any more people out there?
We could send a search party.

688
00:38:09,993 --> 00:38:10,996
21 men

689
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,192
and 32 women.

690
00:38:13,928 --> 00:38:15,104
I'll do a head count.

691
00:38:22,732 --> 00:38:24,237
What happened to you out there?

692
00:38:27,323 --> 00:38:29,060
We waited in that field
for two days

693
00:38:29,061 --> 00:38:30,410
after our plane went down.

694
00:38:32,648 --> 00:38:33,612
No one came.

695
00:38:34,905 --> 00:38:35,812
Eventually, I...

696
00:38:36,371 --> 00:38:37,239
went for help.

697
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:38,648
I walked for...

698
00:38:40,307 --> 00:38:41,253
I don't how long.

699
00:38:42,816 --> 00:38:43,722
Wound up in this...

700
00:38:44,301 --> 00:38:45,285
refugee camp.

701
00:38:45,922 --> 00:38:46,539
Nebraska.

702
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:51,884
Most of us are from there.

703
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,868
I can't imagine
what you've seen out there.

704
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,260
Roger?

705
00:39:05,158 --> 00:39:07,048
I said, I can't imagine
what you've seen.

706
00:39:09,517 --> 00:39:11,099
Couldn't have
imagined it either.

707
00:39:16,057 --> 00:39:16,790
Hey, wash up.

708
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:17,967
Dinner's almost ready.

709
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:19,491
Robert?

710
00:39:20,746 --> 00:39:21,295
Darcy,

711
00:39:21,296 --> 00:39:23,485
I need you to keep the kids
in the house for a while

712
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,067
until I can sort something out.

713
00:39:25,704 --> 00:39:26,669
What does that mean?

714
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:29,157
It means you stay inside,

715
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:31,550
and you don't answer the door.

716
00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:34,850
Here.

717
00:39:38,922 --> 00:39:39,925
We're playing football.

718
00:39:40,774 --> 00:39:42,298
Man, Sam,
that is really cool.

719
00:39:42,664 --> 00:39:44,381
Daddy's gonna put that
on the fridge.

720
00:39:45,654 --> 00:39:47,409
Sam, I want you to go upstairs,

721
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,818
tell your sister dinner's ready.

722
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:49,879
Okay? Right now.

723
00:39:53,794 --> 00:39:54,874
<i>Allison!</i>

724
00:39:57,363 --> 00:39:59,042
Are we in danger, Robert?

725
00:40:00,913 --> 00:40:02,843
I've asked you that question
a thousand times,

726
00:40:02,844 --> 00:40:03,884
you've always said no.

727
00:40:05,524 --> 00:40:06,258
I don't...

728
00:40:06,586 --> 00:40:08,476
mean to scare you, D.

729
00:40:15,673 --> 00:40:17,506
All right, we'll do
whatever you say.

730
00:40:20,323 --> 00:40:21,094
I trust you.

731
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,110
My God. Where did
they all come from?

732
00:40:32,785 --> 00:40:35,196
I'm gonna need warm water,
as much as you can make.

733
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:37,296
I've made a list of the injured.

734
00:40:49,431 --> 00:40:50,338
How's he doing?

735
00:40:50,917 --> 00:40:52,345
I think he might be in shock.

736
00:40:56,453 --> 00:40:57,707
He doesn't want to be treated

737
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:59,405
until everybody else
has been seen.

738
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:03,070
- Jake, I, um...
- Go.

739
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:06,292
He's gonna need you.

740
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,898
<i>You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.</i>

741
00:41:20,899 --> 00:41:22,654
<i>You need to keep them
clean and warm.</i>

742
00:41:23,425 --> 00:41:24,659
Do you have a place to stay?

743
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:27,554
Do you know anyone
in Jericho?

744
00:41:30,351 --> 00:41:31,277
Actually...

745
00:41:32,107 --> 00:41:32,840
I do.
