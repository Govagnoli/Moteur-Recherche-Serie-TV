1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,230
previously on jericho

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,650
" All right,it looks like the explosion came from the west,maybe denver.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,630
This could've been a test,could've been an accident.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,060
But if it was an attack and there's chaos out there,

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,980
you might not want the wrong people knowing that jericho is still here.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,020
The unfortunate truth is there was another explosion in atlanta.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,950
Oh,my god,we got something!

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,600
Were they just reporting it or are they behind it?

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,240
Hire as many deputies as you can.

10
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,860
Use them to help you get gas.

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,460
Clinic's running low.

12
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,280
Couldn't find an empty pesticide container.

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,410
I thought this water tank might do.

14
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,880
No,no,no,we can't use steel.

15
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,340
There's too much risk of static.

16
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,390
The gas has been sloshing around in there.

17
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,070
One spark,the whole thing could blow sky high.

18
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,480
We don't have time to look for something else.

19
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,170
help.

20
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,530
He's a refugee from denver.

21
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,680
You recognize him?

22
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,430
No.

23
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,210
We need information.

24
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,020
Where are they?

25
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:49,870
It burns.

26
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,400
He needs morphine.

27
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,320
why did you go back to denver?

28
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,750
I couldn't let them die.

29
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,750
Well,it was a mistake,vic...

30
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,250
because now we are a man down.

31
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,760
he's gone.

32
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,510
I'm tired of war.

33
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,740
No one ever really wins.

34
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,270
Stanley: Me,too.

35
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,930
Guess we can play crazy eights instead.

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,280
Or hearts?

37
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,550
I'm calling it a night.

38
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,170
You can call it whatever you want,but it stopped being night hours ago.

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,850
Y'all want coffee?

40
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,770
Make mine an irish.

41
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,660
So,mimi,what would you be doing if you were back home in D.C.?

42
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,420
Sleeping.

43
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,530
You know the hardest thing out sleeping in this dump?

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,400
What?
The quiet.

45
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,470
I don't know how you stand it.It's like my brain is an echo chamber.

46
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,640
Well,why do you think I left town?

47
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,170
I could tell her.

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,550
What?

49
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,890
Why jake left town.

50
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,540
Hey,watch it,jimmy.

51
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,410
Let me guess.

52
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,000
The pressure got to be too much.

53
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,960
I'm a people reader.

54
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,030
I'm betting captain of the football team,prom king...

55
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,060
most likely to succeed.

56
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,810
Am I right?

57
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,790
Don't quit your day joB.

58
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,260
why?

59
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,670
What am i missing here?

60
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,210
I think he beat up the prom king.

61
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,430
Oh,yeah,I did.

62
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,380
Eric,you must have a million stories about your brother screwing up,right?

63
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,410
Yeah,at least that many.

64
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,220
Could we get a couple coffees to go,mary?

65
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,940
Coming up.

66
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,330
So...

67
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,270
do we have a plan?

68
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,330
just try to get news,make contact.

69
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,850
We haven't heard from gray in a couple days,so...

70
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,000
no,eric...

71
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,720
do we have a plan?

72
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,420
I will talk to april tonight.

73
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,710
Then?

74
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,330
And then I won't need coffee as an excuse to come see you.

75
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,980
Secrets of a small town.

76
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,170
Hello

77
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,800
Hello,this is assistant secretary walsh from the department of homeland security.

78
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,710
Do not be alarmed.

79
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,150
If you are safe,stay where you are.

80
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,200
Do not attempt to leave.
Who is it,rob?

81
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,490
We will be in contact again shortly.

82
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,380
Until then,know that help is on the way.

83
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,150
hello,this is assistant secretary walsh from the department of homeland security.

84
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,480

if you are safe,stay where you are.

86
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,990
Do not attempt to leave...

To town hall,you good?

91
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,630
Yeah.

92
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,900
Homeland security?

93
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,430
That's what they said.

94
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,630
So they're in charge now?

95
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,610
Well,they're supposed to be in charge in case of a disaster.

96
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,030
So what happens next?

97
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,750
Why are you asking her?She's from the irs.

98
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,750
She's from D.C.

99
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,060
This is what they told us.

100
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,780
First,they restore power,then communication,then transportation.

101
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,380
I am this close to non-fat lattes and shiatsu.

102
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,810
Does anybody have a quarter?

103
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,730
If they can call in,maybe we can call out.

104
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,290
calling roger

105
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,300
hey,did your phone ring?

106
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,770
Yeah,everyone's did.

107
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,690
All the land lines in town.
Why?

108
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,580
Because kansas has a reverse 911 system.

109
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,740
If there's an emergency,it just pulses out a call.

110
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,080
That's what we all heard.

111
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,500
Why can't we call out?

112
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,760
Everybody's trying to use the phone at the same time.

113
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,340
System's overloaded.

114
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,820
You think the power's back for good?

115
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,320
I don't know,I'm not gonna count on it.

116
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,760
Hey,skylar.

117
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,140
Any luck?

118
00:05:59,170 --> 00:05:59,880
No.

119
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,250
I really need to check my e-mail.

120
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,590
I mean,my parents could've tried to contact me from new york.

121
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,300
Well,have you tried typing a straight ip address?

122
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,030
A what?

123
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:14,780
It's weird.

124
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,990
What?

125
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,090
Well,the internet was built by the military.

126
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,480
It's supposed to survive nuclear war.

127
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,450
So why can't I check my e-mail?

128
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,810
Allison.

129
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,480
Is it working now?

130
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,580
it is,but...

131
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,940
not for us.

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,580
We're being blocked out.

133
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,070
Uh,miss?

134
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,480
You can't do thaT.
Yeah,okay,thanks.

135
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,650
welcome to kansas liberty bank

136
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,590
card held

137
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,110
Your machine just ate my card.

138
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,720
Doesn't work.

139
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,870
That's what I tried to tell you.

140
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,190
Thank you.

141
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,560
You're just so helpful.

142
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,720
Hey,dad.

143
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,360
It's the same thing on every channel?

144
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,710
So far.

145
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,890
What about the radio?

146
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,620
Same message-- sit and wait.

147
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,920
You look like crap.

148
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,840
I didn't sleep.

149
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,190
Next time put the cards down,go home.

150
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,010
Sooner or later,the phones are gonna free up.

151
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,220
Let's keep calling out until we reach somebody.

152
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,630
Calling who?

153
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,860
Well,that homeland security message came out of topeka; let's start there.

154
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,870
Yeah,but everybody's thinking that.

155
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,870
I say we start with the national guard base in great bend.

156
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,530
That's a good idea,son.

157
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,430
We should get to the gas station,get some gas while...

158
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,950
I already sent jimmy.

159
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,880
He's there now running the pumps.

160
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,440
All right,well,we need to charge our batteries.

161
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,770
All right.

162
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,740
Looks like you got it covered.

163
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,580
Where you going?

164
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,060
Home.

165
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,500
You take a shower?

166
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,320
Nothing gets past you.

167
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,010
Go clean the tub and fill it up.

168
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,570
Why?

169
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,450
The water doesn't get to that shower by magic.

170
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,590
If the power goes out again,so do the pumps that get it there.

171
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,740
So we store what we can.

172
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,970
That is why...

173
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:12,080
she is your daughter,rob,not your employee.

174
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,800
Well...

175
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,550
she needs to talk less and listen more.

176
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,180
You need to learn to ease up on her.

177
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,990
Darcy...

178
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:36,080
I don't know how long I'll be here,so whatever i gotta teach her,it needs to happen now.

179
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:59,760
you know,when we find out what's going on,are you gonna stay or leave?

180
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,240
Don't think about that yet.

181
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,990
Well,I can't help it.

182
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,760
I finally have you back.

183
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,370
you were always good at blocking out the bad.

184
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,280
Dad,not so much.

185
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,220
He's had more to block out.

186
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:19,180
When you left,you left quite a mess.

187
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,230
You have no idea of the lengths you father went to to square things.

188
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,180
Then why didn't he talk to me?

189
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,470
Because he knew you'd resent it.

190
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,360
And there's a stubborn streak that runs in the family.

191
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,190
Honey...

192
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,800
I think you owe him the truth.

193
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,110
You want me to tell him about my...

194
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,730
about my time away?

195
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,620
This house is too small for big secrets.

196
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,050
what was that?

197
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,060
It's a power spike.

198
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,440
Boys.

199
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,330
wow,looks like business as usual.

200
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,950
How'd you get your kids back so quick?

201
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,210
Always lead with recess.

202
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,530
Emily: Got to get things back to normal.

203
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,880
Whatever that is.

204
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,690
Go!Go!Go!

205
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,090
Hurry,hurry!

206
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,470
emily?

207
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,400
Emily...

208
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,480
emily?

209
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,810
Emily?

210
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,570
Oh,my god.

211
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,260
Emily,wake up.

212
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,870
Emily,wake up.

213
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,230
Uh,everybody...

214
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,300
do you remember the emergency drills we did at school?

215
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:51,960
okay.

216
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,770
Go find your buddy and go sit behind the fence.

217
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,670
One,two,three,go!

218
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,140
Come on,quickly.

219
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,290
Go.

220
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,390
Is she going to wake up?

221
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,800
Yes.

222
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,890
With super powers?

223
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,620
Probably not.

224
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,450
Now,go.Go!

225
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,170
Go,lucas,go!

226
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,880
Come on,emily,come on.

227
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,390
Wake up.

228
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,580
Wonder when they're going to come.

229
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,690
You really can't wait to fly this coop,huh?

230
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,140
Are you still going to file that irs report on my farm?

231
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,020
That's not exactly my first order of business,

232
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:39,310
but it is the reason I fell into this godforsaken hellhole in the first place.

233
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,840
So is that a yes,no or maybe?

234
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,640
It's an eventually.

235
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,320
Look,if it were up to me,I'd see what I could do.

236
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,570
But that's probably justthe irish coffee talking.

237
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,740
You got a family back home?

238
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,760
I have fish.

239
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,050
I'm sure they really miss you.

240
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,870
I wonder what that's about.

241
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,000
Mary,keep my tab open,will ya?

242
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,500
Your tab,stanley?

243
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,840
Yeah,and keep the irish coffees coming.

244
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,340
Till I get my farm back at least.

245
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,270
You heard the hillbilly.

246
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,290
Keep 'em coming.

247
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,890
enter id

248
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,610
okay,let's board her.Get an I.V.Started and get some o2 on her.

249
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,520
Keep an eye on the pulse and let me know if her bp drops.

250
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,680
We got to keep an eye on her.

251
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,730
Where's ashlee?

252
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,730
She went to get alice.

253
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:43,960
Alice?

254
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,270
Alice in wonderland?

255
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,940
Inside?

256
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,900
ashlee?

257
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,470
Ashlee!

258
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,580
Ashlee?

259
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,750
Honey?

260
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,400
Ashlee,honey.

261
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,480
Ashlee,it's ms.Lisinski.

262
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,670
Ashlee!

263
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,960
Ashlee!

264
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,120
Chief,we've got another blaze over on the south side.Over.

265
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,130
Copy that.

266
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,850
We've got a second fire.

267
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,770
It's south side near the trailer park.

268
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,870
But we don't have enough guys to fight this one.

269
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,240
They'll come back as soon as they can.

270
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,620
Take the second truck.

271
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,770
Move!

272
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,190
truck 77,let's get a ladder up there.

273
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,320
what happened?

274
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,780
Looks like she got hit with a lot of voltage.

275
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,680
Go ahead,lock it in!

276
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,160
How'd it start?

277
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:50,960
Power lines.

278
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,850
Power lines?

279
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,310
Hold the water.

280
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,450
What's wrong?

281
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,990
Electrical fire.

282
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,110
Spray water on electricity everybody it touches gets fried.

283
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,300
Johnston.

284
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,100
I thought you were at the ranch.

285
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,120
The horses are safe.

286
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,120
What about the stables?

287
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,980
There's nothing but dirt around for miles.

288
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,770
They're fine.

289
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,150
You are not going to that fire.

290
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,900
I let chief carrol and half the department go to denver.

291
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,340
We're down to a handful of men.

292
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,940
Who can handle it.

293
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,910
Johnston,if you get any sicker than you already are,you're not going to be any use to anybody.

294
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,040
Dad,dad,are you still there?

295
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,720
Yeah,eric,I'm on my way.

296
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,740
No,no,no,no,go downstairs and turn off the power grid to the library.

297
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,490
Give me five minutes.

298
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,940
Looks like you get your way.

299
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,400
They can use me here.

300
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,570
Good.

301
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,780
The power should be cut in five minutes.

302
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,430
Get your men in position.

303
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,740
Cover one-seven four blocks east of maple.

304
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,320
Uh,one call.Stand by.

305
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,220
What are you doing?

306
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,700
Making sure she didn't have a heart attack.

307
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,690
you're in good hands.

308
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,550
Power's down.You're good to go.

309
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,440
Copy.

310
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,020
All right,that's it,power's down.

311
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,960
Okay,open them up.

312
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,060
They're on.

313
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,030
Okay.

314
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,340
What's going on?

315
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,060
We lost pressure.

316
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,130
Oh,my god.

317
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,590
Pumping station must be on the same power grid as us.

318
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,610
When we lost power to one...we cut into both.

319
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,370
Where's the pumping station?

320
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,230
Up the hill at the end of chaparral.

321
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,610
Unhook those hoses.

322
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,190
See if there's a working hydrant around back.

323
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,430
Right,chief.

324
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,620
hey,jake.

325
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,960
Stanley.

326
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,040
Thank god.

327
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,010
Chaparral,pumping station,let's go.

328
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,170
Heather...

329
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,590
where's what?

330
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,470
Heather?Where's heather?

331
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,710
Eric.

332
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,430
Yeah?

333
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,320
I think heather might still be inside.

334
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,680
Nah,they said they cleared the building.

335
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,430
Are you sure?

336
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,800
Ventilate that areA.

337
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,720
Eric,what are you doing?

338
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,220
Eric,no!

339
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,230
I wonder what lindsay lohan is doing right now.

340
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,760
Do you think she's still alive?

341
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,490
I'm trying to find my parents,lisa.I could care less.

342
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,030
Great.

343
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,620
My battery's almost dead.

344
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,310
Excuse me,sorry.

345
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,670
Do you guys sell phone chargers?

346
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,440
Um,what kind of phone?

347
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,850
I'll check the back.

348
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:54,960
Thanks.

349
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,150
Why do you like that freak?

350
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,870
Why do you like stupid,bulimic actresses?

351
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,530
Whoa,incoming.

352
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,630
Whoa,sean,no skateboards.

353
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,120
Read the sign.

354
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,640
Hey,you guys got to check it out.

355
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,690
The library's burning,and I didn't even do it.

356
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,060
Is anyone hurt?

357
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,950
Probably.

358
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,300
Sky,let's go.

359
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,600
Go ahead,I'll catch up.

360
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,700
Come on.

361
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,080
This one says universal,so it should work.

362
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,560
Um,we were going to go check out the fire.

363
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,590
If you want to...

364
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:23,760
Dale.

365
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,320
Make sure our extinguishers are working,will ya?

366
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,400
I should stay.

367
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,910
But if you want,I could charge it and you could come back.

368
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,170
Okay.

369
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,630
Um,if my parents call...

370
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,150
I'll find you.

371
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,970
Thanks.

372
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,650
Come on,if we can open the valve,we can get water to the fire.

373
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,060
valve shutoff inside

374
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,020
Ashlee?

375
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,900
hey,ashlee.

376
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,830
Let's get out of here.

377
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,540
Let's go.Come on.

378
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,890
Is anyone here?

379
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,700
Heather?

380
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,810
Come oN.

381
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,180
Hey,come on,let's go.

382
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,000
Better do what the angry fireman says.Let's go.

383
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,460
Come on,this way,let's go!

384
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,250
damn.

385
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,510
it's not going to budge.

386
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,400
Thanks,stanley how do you even know this is it?

387
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,150
Trust me,it's the manual override.

388
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,070
When the power spiked the solenoid valves shut down in the off position.

389
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,920
What?

390
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,590
Dude,you're freaking me out.How do you even know that?

391
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,150
How do you not?

392
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,690
Looks like nobody's touched it in years.

393
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,180
Nobody has.

394
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,920
The motor opens and closes it when the power's on.

395
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,000
No power,no motor.

396
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,210
Yeah,and no water.

397
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,710
Of course,right now what we really need is leverage.

398
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,590
You know what?

399
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,100
Wait right here.

400
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,880
you can't go in there,ma'am.

401
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,580
My husband's in there!

402
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,700
Stand back,please.

403
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,250
Ashlee,we're going to go out another way.

404
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,810
Are you okay?
What's wrong?

405
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,560
nothing,nothing.

406
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,730
We just got to use the other door.

407
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,940
No,no,this way's blocked.

408
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,320
Smoke!

409
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:45,960
We got to stop it.

410
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,800
Okay,okay,uh,can we use this?

411
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,670
Yeah.

412
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,980
okay,honey,I need you to get down and try not to breathe the smoke,all right?

413
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,430
It's all going to be okay,ashlee.

414
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,110
It's going to be okay.

415
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,470
eric?

416
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,580
We need another snake.

417
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:22,100
Ashlee,I need you to crunch down here,like a game of leap frog,okay?

418
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,930
Ready?

419
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,470
this is gonna help protect you.

420
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,350
This'll protect you and help you breathe.

421
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:54,700
Here.

422
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,690
Here.

423
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,680
Here,breathe using this.

424
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,060
got it!

425
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,910
We got it!

426
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,660
it's running,it's running.We got water.

427
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,140
we're gonna be okay.

428
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,010
Come on,this is our chance.Let's get the hell out of here!

429
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,370
Come on,let's go!

430
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,880
come on.

431
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,750
Somebody has to go in there and help them!

432
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,590
Ma'am,stay back,please.

433
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,510
oh,my god.

434
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,160
Are you hurt?

435
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,340
No,don't worry about me.

436
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,470
The little girl,she got a lot of smoke.

437
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,550
April,can you take her?

438
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,270
All right,yeah.

439
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,190
You're gonna be okay,ashlee.

440
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,410
Give me the scope.

441
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,170
I want to see if they have water down at the library.

442
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,840
Listen...

443
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,790
this scope was a christmas present,okay?

444
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,130
Relax.

445
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,650
Careful.

446
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,130
what do you see?

447
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,620
It working.

448
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,140
They've got water at the library.

449
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,900
What about the south side fire?

450
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:35,040
Looks like the fire's out down by the trailer park.

451
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,200
There's a lot of smoke.

452
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,380
There's another fire.

453
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,690
It's in the east woods.

454
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,080
What?!

455
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,800
It's right near eric's house.

456
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,090
What the hell?

457
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,650
What is it,jake?What's going on?

458
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,940
april,april!

459
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:26,480
Eric,eric,there's another fire.

460
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,410
We'll get to it as soon as we can.

461
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,320
We need help clearing the alley.

462
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,170
Eric.
The fire's spreading.

463
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,630
Eric,it's heading to your house!

464
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,330
What do you want to do?

465
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,680
It's heading to your house.

466
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,060
There's nothing to do.

467
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,620
We're already spread too thin.

468
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:54,160
If we don't stop the fire,it could take out main street.

469
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,720
April?

470
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,080
he's right.

471
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,890
hardware

472
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,960
What are you planning to do?

473
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,610
Put out a fire.

474
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,910
Do you need a hand?

475
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,220
I'm good.

476
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,990
If I knew anything,I would tell your mayor.

477
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,880
What do you know?

478
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,080
Not much.

479
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,430
I got the same message as everyone else.

480
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:44,080
Do you want my help?

481
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,680
Get in.

482
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,490
first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to D.C.

483
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,450
Is burn these clothes.

484
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,100
So,what's on your agenda once things settle?

485
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,350
No agenda.

486
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:07,440
Just looking forward to living my life.

487
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,800
With dudley do wrong?

488
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,680
Never gonna happen.

489
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,390
That's really none of your business.

490
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,290
Besides...

491
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,990
you don't know eric the way I do.

492
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,610
Mercifully.

493
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,330
But I know his kind.

494
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:31,280
Guys like that don't leave wives for girls like us.

495
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,520
"Girls like us"?

496
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:38,340
I've been around this particular block before.

497
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:43,970
Well,I'm sorry to blow your theory,but...

498
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,190
eric is telling his wife about us tonight.

499
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,050
Is he now?

500
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,250
Yes,he is.

501
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,370
Well,never mind,then.

502
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,370
To the happy couple.

503
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,830
get up a littlehigher by that chimney.

504
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,290
Hey,we got it!

505
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,250
We got it!Save your house!

506
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,100
What now?

507
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,300
Water.

508
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,170
Let's use the pool pump.

509
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,480
Filter system.

510
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,540
That's pretty smart,jake.

511
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,800
So where'd you learn to do all this?

512
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,870
I was a pool guy.

513
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,500
turn it on!

514
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,680
Turn it on!

515
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,530
what?

516
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,120
Turn on the pump!

517
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,050
Hawkins!

518
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,290
Hawkins!

519
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,780
Come on.

520
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,760
What the hell are you doing?

521
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,650
Fire knocked out the power...

522
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,010
so I found my own.

523
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,670
got it?

524
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,000
That was quick thinking.

525
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,350
Yeah,I was a pool guy,too.

526
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,700
How you doing,ashlee?

527
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,030
I'm okay.

528
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,410
Minor smoke inhalation,but she's gonna be okay.

529
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,090
You saved her life.

530
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,880
Are the other fires still going?

531
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,940
The south side's under control.

532
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,880
The one near your house?

533
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,500
I haven't heard.My wife...

534
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,590
hey,where's april?

535
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,360
You're still here.

536
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,530
Yeah.

537
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,530
Did my parents...

538
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,190
sorry.

539
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,760
It's charged,though.

540
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,710
You going home now?

541
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:13,040
Are you gonna stay here all night?

542
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,830
Don't have anywhere else to go.

543
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,520
The fire moved through the trailer park.

544
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,400
It's all gone.

545
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,260
Oh,dale,I am so sorry.

546
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,210
It's okay.

547
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,720
No,it's not.

548
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,510
Why are you being so calm about it?

549
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,120
Don't have much of a choice.

550
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,970
How 'bout,scream?

551
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,210
Cry.Hit something.Break something.

552
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,520
Come on.

553
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,310
Where are you going?

554
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,460
We'll start with the mayor.

555
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,400
We'll get him to give you a place to live and some clothes and some money.

556
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:45,240
I can take care of myself.I'll be okay.

557
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,900
I was just trying to help.

558
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,860
I know.

559
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,690
I know.

560
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,760
here,let me help you with that.

561
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,630
I got it.

562
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,790
No...

563
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,090
I told you.

564
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,240
I'm sorry.

565
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,620
petition for dissolution of marriage

566
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,220
Divorce papers?

567
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,200
I had them drawn up before the bombs went off.

568
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,560
I didn't want you to see them.

569
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,190
I don'T...

570
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,730
I don't want that anymore.

571
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,790
The divorce,I don't want it.

572
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:02,010
Well,I can't blame you,april.

573
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:08,590
Things have been bad between us for a long time.

574
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,260
Not bad.

575
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,750
Just...

576
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,010
not good.

577
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,580
Not now.

578
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,310
Everything's changed,eric.

579
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,940
The world has changed.

580
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,450
Please.

581
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,360
We can think about this.

582
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,400
Just...

583
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,270
not today.

584
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,770
The good silver.

585
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,910
What's the occasion?

586
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:16,440
Oh,this set's been passed down for five generations.

587
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:20,740
Probably seen the light of day maybe half a dozen times since I've had it.

588
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:24,830
From now on,every night's a special occasion.

589
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,160
Did you turn off the tv?

590
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,330
Yeah.

591
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:34,450
Seemed kind of silly to be staring at a blank screen,waiting for god-knows-who to tell me god-knows-what.

592
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:37,170
It did get me thinking,though.

593
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,930
You know that...

594
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:42,180
that thing you've been running away from?

595
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:45,650
It's not out there.

596
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:49,340
He's upstairs,waiting on dinner.

597
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,770
hi.

598
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,470
I'm glad you're home.

599
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,690
Come on.

600
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,260
Last call,folks!

601
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,790
Closing early tonight!

602
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:27,170
What are we gonna do about this?

603
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,900
Watch it at home.

604
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,170
Or at a friend'S.

605
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,840
last...call.

606
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,950
Stanley,go tell everyone.

607
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,970
But I want to watch.

608
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,450
Then pay your tab.

609
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,980
Okay,I'm going.

610
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,380
Check it out,check it out.

611
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:03,180
It's something else every day.

612
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,540
How are we going to handle all this?

613
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,130
Same way we did today.

614
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:14,310
We lost a few buildings but no lives.

615
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,090
And that is,in no small part,thanks to you.

616
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,170
A lot of folks are saying how lucky jericho is to have you back again.

617
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,620
And what are you telling them?

618
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:30,110
Well,I've tried to correct them,but nobody listens to me.

619
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:46,240
you know what the hardest part about growing up your son was?

620
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:50,470
It's not the politics,or the expectations,it'S...

621
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:55,960
it's that I always knew you were a good judge of character,and you thought mine was lousy.

622
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:03,820
When I left town,I was determined to prove you wrong,but...

623
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:09,910
but instead,everywhere I went,I seemed to prove you right.

624
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,570
Dad...

625
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,260
I wasn't just in san diego.

626
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,950
I don't care.

627
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,790
What?

628
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,440
I don't care.

629
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,420
If you need to tell me,I'll listen,but...

630
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:43,070
wherever you went,whatever you did,it changed you.

631
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:51,890
And a stupid little punk may have left home,but a pretty decent fellow came back.

632
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,320
I can live with that.

633
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,400
flagged passparts

634
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,770
passparts flagged

635
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:04,770
daddy,now that the electricity is back on,can we go to the movies?

636
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,950
Of course.

637
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,280
And baseball games,and the aquarium,and...

638
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,310
let's just...

639
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,800
start with a movie,okay?

640
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,930
Okay.

641
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:16,540
Why were you working outside today?

642
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,790
Daddy had to fix something.

643
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:22,360
What was in that big box?

644
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:25,130
That was my tools.

645
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,100
Come on,sam,it's bedtime.

646
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,770
Will you come tuck me in,dad?

647
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:29,850
Okay.

648
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,900
Did you fix the problem?

649
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,630
daddy's working on it.

650
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,130
After all these years,wanting to have the whole family around the table...

651
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,530
careful what you wish for.

652
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,690
it's delicious,gail.

653
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,520
Thanks.

654
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,270
Yeah,who knew instant potatoes could taste like anything?

655
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,820
Well,things will get better after we get real food.

656
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,040
Filet mignon with bleu cheesE.

657
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,550
Don't pretend you haven't thought about it.

658
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,460
Cheeseburger and french fries.

659
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:21,400
Corned beef and cabbage with that spicy mustard.

660
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,960
Yeah,I could go for a slice of mom's blueberry pie.

661
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,950
Fried chicken with some fresh corn on the cob.

662
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,970
Chocolate cake...

663
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:33,970
excuse me-- they're getting a feed at bailey'S.

664
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:34,900
Let's turn on the tv.

665
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,080
No,they're the only ones picking it up.

666
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,680
I think it's a satellite feed from D.C.

667
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,670
You're coming,aren't you?

668
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,160
Yeah,of course.

669
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,220
keep moving it; we lost the picture.

670
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,100
What's going on?

671
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,710
All right,everybody calm down,all right?

672
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,860
We'll have it back in a second.
