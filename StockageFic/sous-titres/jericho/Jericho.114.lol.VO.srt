00:00:00,462 --> 00:00:01,851
Previously on Jericho

2
00:00:02,199 --> 00:00:03,414
<i>Bring them inside.</i>

3
00:00:03,568 --> 00:00:04,899
<i>Some of them were on planes</i>

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,809
<i>that landed in
the middle of nowhere.</i>

5
00:00:07,022 --> 00:00:08,623
<i>They've been walking
for weeks.</i>

6
00:00:08,932 --> 00:00:10,639
<i>They must have gone
through hell.</i>

7
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,631
<i>Oh, my God... Roger.</i>

8
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:16,710
<i>You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.</i>

9
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:18,370
<i>You need to keep
them clean and warm.</i>

10
00:00:18,446 --> 00:00:19,990
<i>Do you know anyone
in Jericho?</i>

11
00:00:20,164 --> 00:00:22,402
<i>Actually... I do.</i>

12
00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:25,171
<i>Hello, Rob.</i>

13
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,699
<i>We're using the generator
to power the town hall</i>

14
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,043
<i>for three hours a day,
the Med Center for six.</i>

15
00:00:30,244 --> 00:00:33,602
<i>With 53 new people, at current
levels of consumption...</i>

16
00:00:34,023 --> 00:00:37,399
<i>we will be completely out
of gas and diesel in two weeks.</i>

17
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:40,118
<i>- Mrs. Green?
- What?</i>

18
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,134
<i>Eric told me that
April's pregnant.</i>

19
00:00:42,453 --> 00:00:43,822
<i>It's the Old Man.</i>

20
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,424
<i>He's coming for us
using us against each other.</i>

21
00:00:46,482 --> 00:00:49,627
<i>We go see him and if,
if he is behind this,</i>

22
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:50,842
<i>We take him out.</i>

23
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,733
<i>We leave first thing
in the morning.</i>

24
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:19,823
<i>Any luck out there?</i>

25
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,251
Sorry, ma'am.

26
00:01:24,415 --> 00:01:26,614
Nothing?
Not even rabbits?

27
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,773
Never seen anything
like it before.

28
00:01:28,774 --> 00:01:30,202
Nothing moving out there.

29
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:33,629
Think it was the fallout? Maybe it was
the radiation that killed the deer.

30
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,519
There'd still be dead animals,
carcasses, something.

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,364
I mean, it was weird.

32
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:37,623
Like all the game had vanished.

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,923
How far out
did you go?

34
00:01:38,962 --> 00:01:42,628
15 miles out by Mill Pond
along the creek there.

35
00:01:42,748 --> 00:01:44,672
Guess we're going to have
to drive, huh, Jake?

36
00:01:44,673 --> 00:01:47,685
Yeah, but we have to be careful
about burning the gas rations

37
00:01:47,686 --> 00:01:48,688
in the middle of winter.

38
00:01:48,746 --> 00:01:50,674
We need everything we can
to run the generator.

39
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:52,237
We can live without
power for now.

40
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:53,965
Make fires to stay warm.

41
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:56,386
But we won't see Spring
if we don't eat.

42
00:01:56,463 --> 00:01:59,367
Stanley and I will have to use
whatever gas we can spare.

43
00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:01,564
and go out west,
Go out as far as it takes.

44
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:04,372
The rest of the hunting parties
will have to scrounge around locally.

45
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:06,392
Yeah, and Mimi's coming
with us.

46
00:02:07,318 --> 00:02:08,118
What?

47
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,363
Well, in case something happens to me,
I want to make sure she knows...

48
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,785
how to trap and shoot, okay?

49
00:02:16,926 --> 00:02:19,550
Look, the further you get
the hairier the roads are.

50
00:02:19,588 --> 00:02:21,074
With food being
as scarce as it is,

51
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,848
there's bound to be
some trouble out there.

52
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:25,164
That sleeping bag's
rated to 40 below

53
00:02:25,284 --> 00:02:28,327
and here's a wind-proof lighter for you.
You're going to need them both.

54
00:02:28,674 --> 00:02:29,759
Good hunting.

55
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,659
I'm guessing the good folks
of Jericho don't know

56
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,611
about all this stuff down here.
- They don't know about a lot of things.

57
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:39,884
That'll be enough to get us
to the Old Man's place?

58
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:41,982
He is only about
two hours away.

59
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:43,984
I didn't realize
he was so close.

60
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,624
He chose the rally point.

61
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:47,784
Wanted it in his backyard.

62
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:49,366
How long as he been
watching you?

63
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,729
My guess...

64
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,256
since I stopped communications
a few days ago.

65
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:57,769
You worried about what we're
going to find out there?

66
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,969
- You're not.
- We can handle him.

67
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:03,287
It's you and me.
Let's get to work.

68
00:03:07,874 --> 00:03:09,706
My grandmother
went fast than this

69
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:11,250
and she didn't
even have a car.

70
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:13,469
We have to take it easy,
we only have half a tank.

71
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,224
Well, hopefully we'll make it
to Flint Springs. It's got...

72
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:16,652
Hopefully? What do you
mean "hopefully"?

73
00:03:16,653 --> 00:03:18,752
It's got a river.
It's prime white-tailed terrain.

74
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:19,909
I know, but...
This is crazy.

75
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,877
I told you that
I can't hunt.

76
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:23,112
Now you want me to kill Bambi.

77
00:03:23,113 --> 00:03:24,386
You're gonna have to
learn, all right?

78
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:26,392
Everyone's doing their part.
Bonnie's been out twice.

79
00:03:26,393 --> 00:03:27,675
Well, good for
frickin' Bonnie.

80
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:29,025
Bonnie grew up on farm.

81
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:30,761
The closest I ever got
to the outdoors

82
00:03:30,762 --> 00:03:32,923
was the is the Ralph Lauren
section of Neiman Marcus.

83
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:34,099
There you go,
bargain hunting.

84
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,314
Same thing, but with a gun.

85
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,330
Bargains? At Neimans?

86
00:03:37,546 --> 00:03:38,356
Sometimes I forget

87
00:03:38,357 --> 00:03:40,536
that the biggest designer
in your closet is Wrangler.

88
00:03:42,214 --> 00:03:43,304
What are you
laughing at?

89
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,571
I've never seen you in a
domestic squabble before.

90
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:47,341
Knock it off.
This isn't squabbling.

91
00:03:51,836 --> 00:03:52,801
Oh, my God.

92
00:03:56,097 --> 00:03:57,930
These dogs have tags.

93
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:04,544
Look at all this.

94
00:04:09,294 --> 00:04:10,528
Wall Drugs.

95
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:12,342
Wall, South Dakota.

96
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,862
Do you think that's where all
these people were coming from?

97
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:15,795
Think about it.

98
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:18,655
South Dakota without heat,
electricity, or...

99
00:04:19,214 --> 00:04:20,526
food being trucked in.

100
00:04:20,545 --> 00:04:22,475
It's got to be even worse
in North Dakota,

101
00:04:22,476 --> 00:04:23,381
Montana.

102
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,338
Oh, my God.

103
00:04:40,726 --> 00:04:43,505
I read about this
at Blackjack.

104
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:48,050
Mass migration, hundreds...
maybe thousands of people

105
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:49,941
heading south.

106
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:53,606
Trying to outrun winter.

107
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:56,594
Should we be doing
that, too?

112
00:05:21,752 --> 00:05:22,929
How far is it?

113
00:05:24,974 --> 00:05:25,997
...60.

114
00:05:26,614 --> 00:05:27,868
It's about 60 yards.

115
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:32,758
So 60 yard with almost
1.5 people per yard.

116
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,895
That's 90.

117
00:05:33,896 --> 00:05:35,883
That's almost 100 people
just across.

118
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:37,181
The way the ground
is trampled,

119
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:39,110
you got to figure five
or tens times that amount

120
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:40,228
of people came through here.

121
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:43,355
Almost a thousand people?
Where are they going?

122
00:05:44,203 --> 00:05:46,036
South Texas, Mexico.

123
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,535
Anyplace warmer.

124
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,715
It'd take weeks
to get there by foot.

125
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,913
God know how many thousand
people have the same idea.

126
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:53,554
Mexico's borders
could be closed.

127
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:55,734
We don't even know if
there still is a Mexico.

128
00:05:56,932 --> 00:05:58,341
Maybe we should try
to catch on with them.

129
00:05:58,342 --> 00:06:02,219
We can barely feed ourselves,
let alone... hundreds more.

130
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:05,728
We got to keep going.

131
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:09,394
Let's go.

132
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,302
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

133
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,290
Hey. Glad you came down.

134
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:26,901
Thank you.

135
00:06:27,516 --> 00:06:29,310
- What time did you, uh...
- Early...

136
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:30,738
late, I guess.

137
00:06:30,804 --> 00:06:32,859
I didn't want to wake you,
you looked so peaceful.

138
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,519
Peaceful? Really?

139
00:06:34,616 --> 00:06:37,307
Did you have another one of those
bad dreams? Keep on there.

140
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:39,543
I guess neither one of
us got much sleep.

141
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:43,185
All I could do was think about
all these people down here, you know.

142
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:45,896
And then I remembered about the
clothes we had in the attic.

143
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:47,550
I thought that sweater
looked familiar.

144
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,531
Yeah, that woman was on
layover in Kansas City

145
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:50,534
when the bombs went off,

146
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:53,220
Her husband and two kids
were waiting for her at home.

147
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:54,064
Where?

148
00:06:54,103 --> 00:06:55,029
Denver.

149
00:06:56,881 --> 00:06:58,367
I lead these people here.

150
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,414
For better or worse
this is their home now.

151
00:07:00,491 --> 00:07:02,555
It's on me to make sure
they're taken care of.

152
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:05,006
Yeah, of course.

153
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:07,263
What can I do to help, huh?

154
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:10,981
Talk to them,
follow your instincts.

155
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:13,219
The truth is...

156
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:15,110
I'm winging this myself.

157
00:07:23,053 --> 00:07:24,191
I'll be outside.
Here.

158
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,927
Should be back
before dark.

159
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:34,474
And if you're not?

160
00:07:37,643 --> 00:07:39,688
Just tell me when I
should start to worry.

161
00:07:40,016 --> 00:07:41,386
This is the last time,

162
00:07:41,637 --> 00:07:42,466
okay?

163
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,762
After today

164
00:07:45,205 --> 00:07:46,382
I'm here...

165
00:07:48,408 --> 00:07:49,700
for good, huh?

166
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:52,082
Okay.

167
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:54,262
I'll hold you to that.

168
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:06,353
Hi, honey.

169
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,195
How'd it go this morning?

170
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:09,691
The whole thing
was a bust.

171
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:10,983
I'm sorry, hon.

172
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:12,073
Jake's out there now.

173
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,231
Hopefully he and Stanley

174
00:08:13,232 --> 00:08:14,736
will have better luck
than I did.

175
00:08:15,015 --> 00:08:15,816
Is April here?

176
00:08:15,817 --> 00:08:16,867
No, she's at
the clinic.

177
00:08:16,868 --> 00:08:18,815
She promised me
she'd take a nap.

178
00:08:19,018 --> 00:08:21,526
I hope it is warmer in that
clinic than it is in this house.

179
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:23,532
I think this house has
dropped ten degrees

180
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:24,612
in the last hour.

181
00:08:25,442 --> 00:08:27,159
Feels like a storm's
coming in.

182
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:31,316
We'd better seal up these
windows the best was we can.

183
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:33,574
Been going around collecting
old sheets and linens.

184
00:08:33,575 --> 00:08:35,851
We'll shove them
underneath the doors.

185
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,433
Look what I found...

186
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,459
hidden in Jake's closet.

187
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,539
Lord knows how long
that's been there.

188
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:45,738
Well, at least he was
drinking the good stuff.

189
00:08:45,777 --> 00:08:48,555
I used to hide the most awful
rotgut in the world

190
00:08:48,556 --> 00:08:50,214
behind my mother's
china cabinet.

191
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:56,441
What do you think?

192
00:08:57,927 --> 00:08:59,297
On an empty stomach?

193
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,303
I'll get the glasses.

194
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:06,326
Why would anyone destroy all this.

195
00:10:06,337 --> 00:10:09,421
If they'd wanted it out of commission,
they could have just taken it.

196
00:10:09,436 --> 00:10:11,396
Be worth a fortune after the E.M.P.

197
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,659
Maybe there wasn't time,

198
00:10:13,723 --> 00:10:16,306
or maybe they didn't
care about this stuff.

199
00:10:23,686 --> 00:10:25,628
- How long?
- A couple of days...

200
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:26,780
Give or take.

201
00:10:27,277 --> 00:10:29,286
But we just heard
from him yesterday.

202
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,620
We heard from someone.

203
00:10:32,852 --> 00:10:34,054
Remote uplink.

204
00:10:34,424 --> 00:10:36,620
Somebody else using
his access codes.

205
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:38,354
Who could have done this?

206
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:48,088
Wager for the first kill.

207
00:10:48,654 --> 00:10:50,237
I'm in for a dozen eggs.

208
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:53,075
Two hours chopping wood.

209
00:10:53,422 --> 00:10:55,064
Tax return consultation.

210
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,199
Oh, how about
foot massages for a week?

211
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,095
For me, not for him.

212
00:11:02,072 --> 00:11:03,090
We'll talk.

213
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:04,344
Stanley, stop.

214
00:11:10,154 --> 00:11:12,836
- What are they doing?
- They're blocking the whole road.

215
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:14,651
More like staking it out.

216
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:17,373
All right, turn around.

217
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:18,738
And... and go where?

218
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:22,593
I don't know. Just do it, all right?
Turn around. We'll find another road.

219
00:11:42,012 --> 00:11:43,781
I see it. Damn it.

220
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:50,108
Why are they following us?

221
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,036
Stanley, gun it!

222
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:08,319
This should get us
back to the highway.

223
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,187
Then what?

224
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,445
We try to make it back home,
find the patrol.

225
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,653
Maybe they'll give up by then
or run out of gas.

226
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:15,335
Yeah, if we don't first.

227
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:17,640
Stanley...
Stanley, hold on!

228
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:21,451
Doesn't look like
he put up much of a fight.

229
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:23,203
He was probably out
before he knew what hit him.

230
00:12:23,204 --> 00:12:25,454
He must have trusted whoever did it.

231
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:29,049
The thing is, whoever it was,

232
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:32,020
they knew what
they were doing there,

233
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:33,561
not over here.

234
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,058
I mean, look at this.
It's a mess.

235
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,829
But the drives...
They look like they're still intact.

236
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,070
The old man had information
on the entire team...

237
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:44,079
Contact information,
backgrounds...

238
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,595
Last known whereabouts.

239
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,147
Let's find out where everybody is.

240
00:12:51,743 --> 00:12:53,058
We can't outrun them.

241
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:55,045
- How far till Jericho?
- Too far.

242
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,071
Oh, God!

243
00:13:07,117 --> 00:13:08,134
Stay down.

244
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:16,532
Stay down.

245
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,345
Give me that drive you got there.

246
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:40,021
Must feel good to be back
in the saddle, huh?

247
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,169
I wish we didn't have
to come out here in the first place.

248
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,099
What, are you getting soft on me?
Too much domestic bliss?

249
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,696
Not quite bliss.

250
00:13:49,034 --> 00:13:51,570
There.
There it is. We're in.

251
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:17,302
Thank you.

252
00:14:18,718 --> 00:14:20,509
Karaoke bullfighter, right?

253
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,566
Excuse me?

254
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:23,081
At that bar in Barcelona.

255
00:14:23,104 --> 00:14:26,613
You decked a bullfighter who tried
to get you to stop singing that song...

256
00:14:26,717 --> 00:14:28,150
"Stairway to Heaven"?

257
00:14:28,694 --> 00:14:30,254
Did Roger tell you that?

258
00:14:30,855 --> 00:14:34,096
He also mentioned you like Oreo,
ice cream and white daisies.

259
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:36,997
Don't be mad at him.

260
00:14:37,315 --> 00:14:39,586
He was trying to keep us entertained.

261
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,008
He kept talking and,

262
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:42,626
somehow, we kept moving.

263
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,280
Hey. How you doing?

264
00:14:56,315 --> 00:14:57,648
I'm a little tired.

265
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:00,135
I'm going to head home
and get cleaned up.

266
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,732
Think I'll stay here for a
little longer if you don't mind.

267
00:15:04,148 --> 00:15:05,471
Yeah. Of course.

268
00:15:05,668 --> 00:15:06,694
You sure?

269
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:08,552
Yeah, I'm sure.

270
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:10,991
Looks like you owe
these folks a rematch.

271
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,051
So, um...
I will see you when I see you.

272
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:31,882
- To Jake.
- To Jake.

273
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,697
Who would have thought,
six months ago, you'd be toasting him?

274
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:41,139
Well, God knows Eric wouldn't
have hidden the bottle.

275
00:15:42,147 --> 00:15:44,633
You and Jake have always
had much more in common

276
00:15:44,634 --> 00:15:46,378
than you wanted to admit.

277
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:49,678
You going hunting

278
00:15:50,869 --> 00:15:52,314
all those weekends...

279
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:57,761
Why that kid got sit
in a deer stand for hours?

280
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,027
We wouldn't say a word
to each other. Just...

281
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:04,721
be in the woods together.

282
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:11,488
I was always afraid that Jake
would forget about that.

283
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:14,829
You know, that he'd grow up only
remembering the bad times. That we were

284
00:16:16,872 --> 00:16:19,998
That he wouldn't remember
that we had been close.

285
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:24,397
That we were... buddies once.

286
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:30,312
He remembers...

287
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:35,965
deep down.

288
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,175
That's why you mean
so much to him.

289
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,042
Boy, that wind sounds awful.

290
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:50,366
I hope Stanley and Jake
are okay out there.

291
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:46,180
What happened?

292
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:48,455
Jake, Stanley's not moving.

293
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,461
- What?
- Stanley's not moving.

294
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:00,198
Oh, my God. Go hide.

295
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:03,083
- Go hide.
- No

296
00:18:03,368 --> 00:18:04,579
- Go on.
- No, No. Stanley...

297
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,455
You'll be fine.
Go! Go hide!

298
00:19:27,094 --> 00:19:29,041
Come on.
Help me with Stanley.

299
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,955
I can't move.

300
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,697
Ritts, Woodworth, Pierce.

301
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:39,674
That's half the team.

302
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:42,391
We're being hunted.
It's worse than that.

303
00:19:43,385 --> 00:19:44,975
It's Woodworth and his wife.

304
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,498
They were in Richmond.
That's his daughter.

305
00:19:47,923 --> 00:19:50,084
Anyone close to us
is in danger, too.

306
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:51,622
No loose ends.

307
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:53,600
Don't worry about your family.

308
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,718
We're not going to let
anything happen to them.

309
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:57,542
It's just us, Chavez
and Cheung left.

310
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:59,858
We'll get back out on the field,
stay in the weeds

311
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:01,555
until we can connect
with the chief.

312
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:02,984
Here. Look at this.

313
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,892
What is that?

314
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:11,111
If we are being hunted,

315
00:20:11,651 --> 00:20:14,583
there... is the hunter.

316
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,567
Stanley, are you okay?

317
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,843
Can you get up?

318
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:36,560
Your leg?

319
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:38,914
I think I busted my ankle.

320
00:20:46,754 --> 00:20:47,901
I'm okay.

321
00:20:48,857 --> 00:20:49,937
I'm just stuck.

322
00:20:51,856 --> 00:20:53,795
- Let me try to get this off.
- Stanley, don't.

323
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,574
We can't do this ourselves.
You might make it worse.

324
00:20:58,288 --> 00:20:59,967
Maybe you could dig me out.

325
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:01,780
All right.

326
00:21:02,301 --> 00:21:04,848
Help me get the shovels. They're in
the bed of the truck.

327
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:06,623
It's gone.

328
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:08,620
All right, get the jack.
The jack's back there.

329
00:21:09,306 --> 00:21:10,888
They took everything.

330
00:21:19,493 --> 00:21:20,804
How was your bath?

331
00:21:23,428 --> 00:21:25,859
Lukewarm, then luke-cold,

332
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,275
then pretty much icy.

333
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,439
- Look. Remember this?
- Oh, yeah.

334
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,909
Times Square,
New Year's Eve, 2005.

335
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:34,317
Wasted.

336
00:21:34,664 --> 00:21:36,266
That hangover was epic.

337
00:21:40,122 --> 00:21:43,460
Do you remember the last thing I said to
you the night before you left Jericho ?

338
00:21:43,547 --> 00:21:45,708
That I was selfish
and I didn't listen?

339
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:46,730
Something like that?

340
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:50,588
You have no idea how that ate
at me while you were gone.

341
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:53,830
- I just kept thinking that was
the last  - You were right.

342
00:21:57,252 --> 00:22:02,674
You know, today,
seeing you with those people...

343
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:05,703
It was like you had found yourself.

344
00:22:07,574 --> 00:22:09,927
I'm still just trying to figure
it out, you know?

345
00:22:12,068 --> 00:22:13,592
We're not these people anymore.

346
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:22,354
But I'll tell you the one thing
that hasn't changed.

347
00:22:22,577 --> 00:22:24,043
The one constant.

348
00:22:24,602 --> 00:22:25,567
I love you.

349
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:28,154
And it's going
to take a whole lot more

350
00:22:28,155 --> 00:22:30,199
than the end of the world
to change that.

351
00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:43,998
- How are your legs?
- I don't know I can't feel anything.

352
00:22:44,866 --> 00:22:45,946
The ground's
frozen solid.

353
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,218
It's sucking the heat
right out of you.

354
00:22:47,219 --> 00:22:48,512
Why can't we build a fire?

355
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:49,939
You smell the fumes?

356
00:22:50,113 --> 00:22:51,869
You have to get back to town.

357
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,450
All right. I'm going
to try and go.

358
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,155
No. You can't on that ankle.

359
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:58,509
- I'll go.
- No. Those guys are still out there.

360
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,763
They went the other way.

361
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:02,541
Jericho has a patrol
five miles out of town.

362
00:23:02,637 --> 00:23:04,123
We can't have come
more than ten.

363
00:23:04,219 --> 00:23:05,686
Jake, it's too dangerous.

364
00:23:05,736 --> 00:23:06,778
What are our options?

365
00:23:06,797 --> 00:23:08,167
With no bags, no fire?

366
00:23:08,244 --> 00:23:10,637
All right, one of you goes
or we all die here.

367
00:23:14,997 --> 00:23:16,694
All right, fine, fine.

368
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:20,988
I threw a flashlight over there
somewhere. You might need it.

369
00:23:23,571 --> 00:23:24,574
Listen...

370
00:23:25,808 --> 00:23:28,066
stay on the shoulder
the whole time, okay?

371
00:23:28,386 --> 00:23:30,894
If you see any headlights
or you hear any engines,

372
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:33,576
get low and hide,

373
00:23:33,672 --> 00:23:35,466
all right?
Now, you're gonna
want to head

374
00:23:35,983 --> 00:23:36,976
southeast.

375
00:23:38,114 --> 00:23:40,468
Stanley, that doesn't mean
anything to me.

376
00:23:43,323 --> 00:23:44,674
Stay on this road.

377
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:46,410
Stay on this road
and then you make...

378
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:47,934
make your first left

379
00:23:48,184 --> 00:23:49,998
Okay?
And you're gonna go about a mile

380
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,957
and then you're gonna make
your second right,

381
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:55,342
and you're gonna make another right
and then another left.

382
00:23:55,419 --> 00:23:58,476
And then once you get to the crossroads
of the highway, you're home free...

383
00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:01,573
You'll see a big sign pointing
to the way to Jericho, okay?

384
00:24:01,612 --> 00:24:02,827
Got it?

385
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:05,181
Left, second right.

386
00:24:05,615 --> 00:24:06,946
Right, left,

387
00:24:06,985 --> 00:24:07,785
Right.

388
00:24:12,514 --> 00:24:13,922
Mimi, I...

389
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:15,215
Don't worry.

390
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:16,874
Don't worry.

391
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:18,243
I'll be careful.

392
00:24:32,836 --> 00:24:34,225
<i>Here's what we're gonna do:</i>

393
00:24:34,226 --> 00:24:36,038
I know a place that's safe.

394
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:38,662
We take Darcy and the kids
out of Jericho

395
00:24:38,758 --> 00:24:41,362
and stash them before you and I
get back on the move.

396
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:43,340
I am not leaving them alone.

397
00:24:43,341 --> 00:24:45,076
- I don't think you have a choice.
- No...

398
00:24:45,077 --> 00:24:47,314
See, because I've got leverage.

399
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:50,709
If they kill me, they will
never find the package.

400
00:24:51,094 --> 00:24:52,850
It's not you
they're gonna kill.

401
00:24:53,255 --> 00:24:55,975
It'll be Sam
or Darcy or me;

402
00:24:57,152 --> 00:24:59,660
anything they can use
to get to you.

403
00:25:04,234 --> 00:25:06,626
Anything they can
use to get to me.

404
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:12,094
The body.

405
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:15,402
These... These, uh...

406
00:25:16,488 --> 00:25:20,057
...these half-smashed drives,

407
00:25:20,983 --> 00:25:22,951
<i>...this whole...</i>

408
00:25:23,337 --> 00:25:24,687
this whole setup--

409
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:26,944
If someone had wanted
to destroy all this,

410
00:25:26,945 --> 00:25:28,555
why leave the house
standing, huh?

411
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:30,793
Why not just burn it all down?

412
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:33,311
Someone wanted us
to see all this.

413
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,480
We're being played.

414
00:25:44,117 --> 00:25:45,959
Why would anyone go through
all that trouble?

415
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:47,232
I don't know,

416
00:25:47,695 --> 00:25:48,968
but this is all too big now.

417
00:25:48,969 --> 00:25:50,424
There's too many angles
to cover.

418
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:51,659
Too many unknowns.

419
00:25:53,434 --> 00:25:54,533
I need to get home.

420
00:25:54,534 --> 00:25:55,826
- Robert, wait.
- What?

421
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,337
Let's think about this.

422
00:25:59,338 --> 00:26:01,170
What's the plan?
What are you going to do?

423
00:26:01,415 --> 00:26:04,926
You know, maybe the plan all
along was to get us out here.

424
00:26:05,852 --> 00:26:07,453
I gotta protect
my family, Sarah.

425
00:26:08,495 --> 00:26:09,826
And what about the package?

426
00:26:13,087 --> 00:26:14,620
It'll need to be moved.

427
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:31,792
This isn't so bad, right?

428
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:33,364
Hey, we've been
through worse.

429
00:26:33,407 --> 00:26:35,138
Remember the time we got stuck on
the roof of the...

430
00:26:35,139 --> 00:26:37,205
town hall in the middle
of a lightning storm, huh?

431
00:26:37,572 --> 00:26:39,501
We were so afraid the lightning
was going to...

432
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:41,256
blow up the fireworks.

433
00:26:41,911 --> 00:26:45,094
You squealed like a little girl
wanting to jump off that roof.

434
00:26:45,095 --> 00:26:45,982
That was you.

435
00:26:46,329 --> 00:26:47,872
Your voice hadn't changed yet.

436
00:26:48,528 --> 00:26:51,133
Please, I had you beat by,
like, six months.

437
00:26:53,884 --> 00:26:55,138
Drink some water.

438
00:26:56,373 --> 00:26:57,415
It's frozen right through.

439
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:58,785
What?

440
00:27:04,775 --> 00:27:07,842
I saw an abandoned cabin about
a quarter mile up the road.

441
00:27:07,881 --> 00:27:09,058
You need to get inside.

442
00:27:10,524 --> 00:27:12,222
It'll hurt, but you can make it.

443
00:27:12,241 --> 00:27:13,958
- Jake, I'm staying.
- Listen to me!

444
00:27:14,657 --> 00:27:17,976
There's no point in both of us
freezing to death out there.

445
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,580
- She's coming back.
- When?

446
00:27:21,912 --> 00:27:23,359
She's been gone for, like,
an hour.

447
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,317
It'll take her a little while to
reach the patrol,

448
00:27:25,318 --> 00:27:26,976
but when she does,
she'll find someone.

449
00:27:26,977 --> 00:27:28,153
I know she'll find someone.

450
00:27:28,925 --> 00:27:30,642
Unless somebody finds her first.

451
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:32,146
Look,

452
00:27:32,182 --> 00:27:34,536
it's gonna get dark soon,
you need to go.

453
00:27:43,067 --> 00:27:45,498
You wouldn't leave me
any more than I'm leaving you.

454
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,842
Mimi's strong.
She'll find her way.

455
00:28:03,441 --> 00:28:04,599
Wait...

456
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,354
he said keep going east.

457
00:28:07,782 --> 00:28:09,383
No... southeast.

458
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:14,461
And... look for a sign.

459
00:28:27,525 --> 00:28:29,454
Oh, God, I hate this place!

460
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:05,612
Come on, man.

461
00:29:06,215 --> 00:29:07,276
You can't fall asleep.

462
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:08,703
You got to stay up;
come on.

463
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,029
You stopped shivering.
Come on.

464
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,011
You got to talk to me--
come on, come on, buddy.

465
00:29:12,012 --> 00:29:13,314
You gotta talk to me.

466
00:29:13,353 --> 00:29:14,780
Talk to me, buddy.
Come on.

467
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,325
I'm sorry.

468
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,540
I'm really sorry.

469
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:18,795
About what?

470
00:29:19,526 --> 00:29:21,031
Five years ago.

471
00:29:21,223 --> 00:29:23,056
Sorry I left the way I did.

472
00:29:23,635 --> 00:29:25,178
Iit's okay. It doesn't matter.

473
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:26,394
Doesn't matter.

474
00:29:26,395 --> 00:29:27,771
I was gonna call.

475
00:29:30,183 --> 00:29:31,243
I was gonna call.

476
00:29:31,244 --> 00:29:33,954
I know. Listen, I want you
to forget about it, okay?

477
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:36,276
We never got to go backpacking
in Costa Rica.

478
00:29:36,277 --> 00:29:37,077
You know what?

479
00:29:37,616 --> 00:29:39,632
We're still gonna get to go
backpacking in Costa Rica, okay?

480
00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:40,942
We're gonna...

481
00:29:41,135 --> 00:29:42,351
we're gonna learn how to surf.

482
00:29:42,352 --> 00:29:44,029
We're gonna sleep
on the beach.

483
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,188
As soon as the planes
are up and running again,

484
00:29:46,189 --> 00:29:47,435
it's gonna be you and me.

485
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,923
Hell, you can fly us
there yourself, huh?

486
00:29:49,924 --> 00:29:52,556
Come on. Come on.
Tell me something good, man.

487
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:55,620
I haven't talked to you in five years.
You've been gone for five years.

488
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,895
Tell me... Hey, tell me
about San Diego.

489
00:29:58,896 --> 00:30:00,000
How was it?

490
00:30:00,964 --> 00:30:02,758
- Warm.
- Warm, right.

491
00:30:03,395 --> 00:30:05,209
Beaches, blondes, huh?

492
00:30:06,377 --> 00:30:07,978
What were you doing there?

493
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,158
Flying, flying planes.

494
00:30:10,236 --> 00:30:12,917
Really?
That's cool, man.

495
00:30:12,994 --> 00:30:15,483
Your grandfather
would've been psyched, huh?

496
00:30:15,592 --> 00:30:18,080
Did you have a girl there?
I know you had a girl.

497
00:30:18,428 --> 00:30:19,836
She's dead.

498
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,805
What do you mean?

499
00:30:27,596 --> 00:30:29,081
You don't know that.

500
00:30:29,082 --> 00:30:31,965
I mean, it all depends on where she was
when the bombs went off, right?

501
00:30:31,966 --> 00:30:33,551
I mean, she could
have made it, right?

502
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,451
- Tell me what her name was.
- She's dead....

503
00:30:35,452 --> 00:30:36,705
It was my fault.

504
00:30:36,706 --> 00:30:38,372
- It's not your fault.
- Let me lay down.

505
00:30:38,373 --> 00:30:39,627
- Jake, no.
- Let me lay down.

506
00:30:39,628 --> 00:30:41,499
It wasn't your fault.
Come on... Come on...

507
00:30:41,749 --> 00:30:43,650
Come on, stay with me.
You gotta stay with me.

508
00:30:45,154 --> 00:30:47,161
Come on, Jake.

509
00:30:47,453 --> 00:30:49,402
Stay with me, Jake.
Come on, man.

510
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,607
Stay with me.

511
00:31:12,716 --> 00:31:13,873
Come on!

512
00:31:20,915 --> 00:31:23,230
Okay, gotta keep moving.

513
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:24,850
Gotta keep moving.

514
00:31:50,063 --> 00:31:52,783
Please don't hurt me...
please don't hurt me.

515
00:31:52,822 --> 00:31:54,346
Please don't hurt me!

516
00:31:54,654 --> 00:31:56,063
Please don't hurt me...

517
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,437
Mimi?

518
00:32:00,673 --> 00:32:03,605
- It's Gail and Johnston Green, honey.
You're safe.  - Oh, thanks God!

519
00:32:03,808 --> 00:32:05,516
Come on, baby,
let's get out of here.

520
00:32:05,844 --> 00:32:06,886
Come on.

521
00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:16,416
Those are hideous.

522
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:18,422
Are those the sheets
from your old apartment?

523
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:21,085
Because you can't expect
anyone to sleep on those.

524
00:32:21,543 --> 00:32:24,514
If anyone asks, we'll pretend
someone else donated them.

525
00:32:33,755 --> 00:32:34,777
Your dress.

526
00:32:37,362 --> 00:32:38,983
Guess I shouldn't be seeing this, huh?

527
00:32:40,449 --> 00:32:42,571
The day's sort of come and gone, so...

528
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:45,599
It'll come again.

529
00:32:46,313 --> 00:32:47,316
You think?

530
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,211
I do.

531
00:32:51,677 --> 00:32:53,703
I tell you what, I've got
a pack of Ramen noodles

532
00:32:53,704 --> 00:32:55,304
with your name on it,
what do you say?

533
00:32:55,728 --> 00:32:58,622
Great. I'll deliver this to the shelter
and come back and wash up.

534
00:32:59,181 --> 00:33:00,590
Roger, wait.

535
00:33:02,267 --> 00:33:03,637
I'll come with you.

536
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,869
It's Mom and Dad, honey!

537
00:33:22,505 --> 00:33:24,357
Stanley, you all right, sweetheart?

538
00:33:25,282 --> 00:33:27,385
You need to go get in the truck
and get warm, pal.

539
00:33:27,386 --> 00:33:29,064
- Where's Mimi?
- I'm right here.

540
00:33:29,123 --> 00:33:30,435
Stanley, I'm right here.

541
00:33:33,116 --> 00:33:35,026
Wake up. Wake up!

542
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,071
Wake up, Jake.

543
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:38,479
Wake up.

544
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:39,884
Wake up. Oh, thank God.

545
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:41,234
We're gonna help you, honey.

546
00:33:43,453 --> 00:33:44,784
We saw the storm coming

547
00:33:45,093 --> 00:33:47,254
and we started to worry
when you hadn't come back.

548
00:33:47,255 --> 00:33:48,353
Sweetheart...

549
00:33:51,093 --> 00:33:51,942
Honey,

550
00:33:51,943 --> 00:33:54,160
we're not gonna be able
to get this truck off of him.

551
00:33:54,161 --> 00:33:56,050
I need you to take
these guys back to town

552
00:33:56,051 --> 00:33:57,559
and get me some help out here.

553
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,217
You signal when you're coming back
so I know it's you, all right?

554
00:34:00,218 --> 00:34:02,628
- I'll flash the lights.
- All right, go, go, go!

555
00:34:04,806 --> 00:34:06,234
Jake, look at me, son.

556
00:34:06,235 --> 00:34:07,237
Lookie here.

557
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,764
You're gonna make it, son...
I know you.

558
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:13,449
I know what you're made of.
You're gonna be all right.

559
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:16,593
You're gonna make it.
Stay with me now.

560
00:34:30,114 --> 00:34:32,738
Robert, please,
the kids are sleeping.

561
00:34:33,297 --> 00:34:35,863
- I'm sorry.
- What on earth are you doing?

562
00:34:36,206 --> 00:34:37,730
Oh, I'm sorry.

563
00:34:50,484 --> 00:34:52,355
Jake, you'll be home real soon,

564
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:54,844
but you got to stay
with me now. Come on.

565
00:34:57,207 --> 00:34:59,050
Leave me here.
Leave me alone.

566
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,979
Now, I'm not going anywhere.

567
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:03,101
But you got to hang on.

568
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,301
Now, they'll be here soon, son.

569
00:35:07,346 --> 00:35:08,358
Dad...

570
00:35:08,975 --> 00:35:10,220
I'm sorry.

571
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:13,187
Oh, son, you got nothing
to be sorry about.

572
00:35:18,011 --> 00:35:19,959
Open your eyes, Jake.
Come on, now.

573
00:35:20,808 --> 00:35:22,950
Look at me.
Look at me, Jake.

574
00:35:25,226 --> 00:35:26,712
I can see her.

575
00:35:28,757 --> 00:35:29,895
See who?

576
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:32,866
The girl.

577
00:35:35,161 --> 00:35:36,801
What... girl?

578
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,538
Jake, I think you're hallucinating, son.

579
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:39,561
No, listen to me.

580
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:43,670
When I was in Iraq...

581
00:35:46,082 --> 00:35:47,683
... there was a girl.

582
00:35:50,018 --> 00:35:51,735
She couldn't have been more than...

583
00:35:52,426 --> 00:35:53,583
10 or 12...

584
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,841
Don't talk now, son.

585
00:35:56,033 --> 00:35:57,056
You save your energy.

586
00:35:57,057 --> 00:35:58,677
We'll talk when we get... home.

587
00:35:59,989 --> 00:36:01,493
I killed her, Dad.

588
00:36:07,378 --> 00:36:09,075
I killed a little girl.

589
00:36:31,717 --> 00:36:33,048
Hurry up!

590
00:36:46,089 --> 00:36:47,575
Open your eyes, Jake.

591
00:36:47,576 --> 00:36:48,945
Open your eyes.

592
00:36:50,237 --> 00:36:52,011
All right, everyone on three...

593
00:36:52,012 --> 00:36:53,015
One,

594
00:36:53,343 --> 00:36:54,828
two, three!

595
00:37:00,171 --> 00:37:01,271
All right, he's free.

596
00:37:01,773 --> 00:37:03,065
Let's get the board in here.

597
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:05,902
One, two, three.

598
00:37:16,821 --> 00:37:17,844
You were right.

599
00:37:17,845 --> 00:37:20,776
I need to get my family
as far away from me as possible.

600
00:37:21,683 --> 00:37:23,187
I've been thinking, and...

601
00:37:23,978 --> 00:37:25,638
There's no other choice.

602
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,898
You're doing the right thing.

603
00:37:30,345 --> 00:37:31,425
Listen.

604
00:37:33,355 --> 00:37:34,744
After they're safe,

605
00:37:35,265 --> 00:37:37,117
you and me need
to get back in the field.

606
00:37:37,618 --> 00:37:39,547
That's half our team gone, Sarah,

607
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,762
and whoever did that
did it for a reason.

608
00:37:44,752 --> 00:37:46,431
How are you gonna tell Darcy?

609
00:37:49,497 --> 00:37:51,292
I'll tell her after I've moved them.

610
00:37:52,526 --> 00:37:55,189
She'll never agree if she knows
I won't be staying with them.

611
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,845
He's better off here
than the med center.

612
00:38:08,096 --> 00:38:11,221
We're still on emergency power,
and it's... it's warmer here.

613
00:38:12,784 --> 00:38:14,115
Here, honey.

614
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:16,002
What about his injuries?

615
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:17,916
Well, the cut on his head
isn't very deep,

616
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:20,053
and neither one
of his legs are broken.

617
00:38:20,786 --> 00:38:22,001
He's very lucky.

618
00:38:22,002 --> 00:38:23,313
I'm freezing.

619
00:38:23,738 --> 00:38:25,551
I'm gonna go get you
some more blankets.

620
00:38:26,033 --> 00:38:27,557
You're still hypothermic.

621
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:30,567
It's just gonna take a few hours
for your body to stabilize.

622
00:38:32,264 --> 00:38:34,406
- Can we have a minute?
- Oh, sure.

623
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,133
Dad...

624
00:38:55,782 --> 00:38:57,326
What I told you out there...

625
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,802
please forget it.

626
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,657
Please.

627
00:39:08,419 --> 00:39:09,847
Afraid I can't do that.

628
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,564
I've seen a lot of things
in my time, Jake.

629
00:39:26,918 --> 00:39:28,133
I've been to war.

630
00:39:29,445 --> 00:39:32,821
I know what war can do.
I know what men can do... Terrible...

631
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,716
... terrible things.

632
00:39:38,623 --> 00:39:39,974
I know what I did.

633
00:39:42,636 --> 00:39:44,141
You can talk to me.

634
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,015
When you're ready, son.

635
00:40:14,354 --> 00:40:15,569
When you're ready.

636
00:40:33,608 --> 00:40:34,977
You okay?

637
00:40:43,273 --> 00:40:44,546
How's the sprain?

638
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:49,119
I think it'd be better with painkillers,
but I'm not gonna complain.

639
00:40:50,025 --> 00:40:53,147
You know, for a while there, I didn't
think I'd ever feel anything again.

640
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:57,545
When I was out there,

641
00:40:58,066 --> 00:40:59,398
just for a moment,

642
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:02,234
I didn't think
I was gonna make it.

643
00:41:03,277 --> 00:41:05,940
And I stopped... to rest.

644
00:41:06,827 --> 00:41:09,316
And then I just didn't
even want to move.

645
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:14,081
But you did.

646
00:41:15,586 --> 00:41:16,898
You did make it.

647
00:41:18,364 --> 00:41:19,927
And I knew you would.

648
00:41:26,582 --> 00:41:28,454
Your lips are still cold.

649
00:41:30,749 --> 00:41:32,601
Maybe you can warm them.

650
00:41:37,193 --> 00:41:39,450
That's the worst line
I've ever heard.

651
00:41:39,971 --> 00:41:41,881
I know. I've got others.

652
00:41:43,116 --> 00:41:44,717
- Shut up.
- Okay.

653
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:56,879
Tomorrow morning...

654
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,114
we're leaving.

655
00:42:01,423 --> 00:42:03,251
We're leaving?
For... for where?

656
00:42:05,201 --> 00:42:06,399
I don't know yet.

657
00:42:07,461 --> 00:42:08,633
You don't know?

658
00:42:13,141 --> 00:42:15,585
Darcy, when I came
to get you in DC...

659
00:42:17,697 --> 00:42:19,364
I told you it wasn't safe,

660
00:42:19,981 --> 00:42:21,587
but I couldn't tell you why.

661
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,317
I'm going for a walk.

662
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,477
I have something
in my possession.

663
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:47,507
And there's people
out there that want it,

664
00:42:48,062 --> 00:42:50,235
that will stop at nothing to get it.

665
00:42:52,552 --> 00:42:54,152
And that puts you,
me and the kids

666
00:42:54,547 --> 00:42:55,673
in danger here.

667
00:43:01,827 --> 00:43:03,931
Okay, so th... then we go.

668
00:43:05,274 --> 00:43:06,479
<i>I trust you.</i>

669
00:43:12,188 --> 00:43:13,353
<i>Robert, do y...</i>

670
00:43:14,806 --> 00:43:15,873
Do you trust me?

671
00:43:18,866 --> 00:43:21,149
- You're late.
- You're impatient.

672
00:43:26,442 --> 00:43:27,933
Then listen to me.

673
00:43:28,812 --> 00:43:30,976
Okay, Sarah is not on our side.

674
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,862
Now... whatever's...

675
00:43:33,365 --> 00:43:34,689
gone on between the two of you,

676
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:37,010
I'm telling you, Robert,
she's not here to help us.

677
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:42,018
Have you located the package?

678
00:43:42,729 --> 00:43:43,734
Soon.

679
00:43:45,177 --> 00:43:47,114
Hawkins is starting to put
the pieces together.

680
00:43:47,115 --> 00:43:49,643
- He needs to be eliminated.
- I know.

681
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:52,764
We've already eliminated the other
three targets without incident.

682
00:43:52,765 --> 00:43:54,444
Why are you stalling on this one?

683
00:44:05,437 --> 00:44:07,205
Because this one is different.
