1
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:27,625
Nice planes.

2
00:00:27,816 --> 00:00:30,372
Yeah, every aircraft
we operate is augmented

3
00:00:30,373 --> 00:00:32,414
with custom security
and design features

4
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:34,343
you won't find
in any other fleet.

5
00:00:39,033 --> 00:00:41,001
I see that you're
an Embry-Riddle grad.

6
00:00:41,136 --> 00:00:44,879
ATP-certified,
1,600 verified FAA hours.

7
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:46,847
Clearly well qualified,
Mr. Green.

8
00:00:46,982 --> 00:00:48,236
Flying's in my blood.

9
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:51,226
I started working on my Grandpa's
crop duster when I was 10.

10
00:00:51,513 --> 00:00:52,959
Now you understand
that we charter

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,645
exclusively
to top executives

12
00:00:54,646 --> 00:00:57,126
and celebrity clients,
so absolute discretion

13
00:00:57,127 --> 00:00:58,554
is a must for our flight crew.

14
00:00:58,816 --> 00:01:00,341
Hey, anything past
getting the plane

15
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:01,535
safely from "A to "B"

16
00:01:01,536 --> 00:01:02,623
is none of my business.

17
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:04,533
Good, of course, finding
out everything we can

18
00:01:04,534 --> 00:01:07,090
about the people who are piloting
our planes is our business.

19
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:08,548
And according
to your visa records,

20
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:11,325
you spent a little time in the
Middle East over the last few years.

21
00:01:11,326 --> 00:01:13,275
14 months in Afghanistan, 6 in Iraq.

22
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,899
But you were never military?

23
00:01:15,363 --> 00:01:17,177
I worked for an
independent contractor.

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,836
Left that off the resum.

25
00:01:18,922 --> 00:01:20,206
I didn't think
it was relevant.

26
00:01:20,543 --> 00:01:23,214
State Department has you
flagged as a person of interest.

27
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,710
I'm an interesting guy.

28
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,224
There was an incident.

29
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:31,925
I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

30
00:01:31,955 --> 00:01:33,585
Which contractor
were you working with

31
00:01:33,586 --> 00:01:35,138
when this
incident occurred?

32
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:36,198
One of the big ones.

33
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:38,947
- Halliburton, Blackwater?
- You said discretion was a must.

34
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:44,176
Look, I'm going to be straight with you.
I think there's room in our operation

35
00:01:44,177 --> 00:01:45,884
for someone like you,
but there is no way

36
00:01:45,887 --> 00:01:48,289
that I can hire you if you
are unable to clear this up.

37
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:50,623
Do you understand that?

38
00:01:54,096 --> 00:01:55,369
Thank you for your time.

39
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:11,323
<i>The president is scheduled
to address the nation tomorrow

40
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:12,731
<i>amid growing disapproval.

41
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:15,722
<i>Recent polls show his rating
plunging double digits

42
00:02:15,723 --> 00:02:18,287
<i>into the 20s,
even amongst partisan voters.

43
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:20,699
<i>With midterm elections
on the horizon,

44
00:02:20,868 --> 00:02:23,168
<i>this is not a good sign
for the administration.

45
00:02:29,137 --> 00:02:31,163
I've already been
summoned, Sarah.

46
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:33,883
They want me in position.

47
00:02:34,384 --> 00:02:35,658
This is good news.

48
00:02:37,722 --> 00:02:39,864
We talking locally
or back to the farmland?

49
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,118
I'm waiting to hear.

50
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:43,993
Congratulations.

51
00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:48,777
It was your idea.

52
00:02:50,716 --> 00:02:52,086
I have to say that...

53
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:53,957
when they recruited me,

54
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,562
I thought I was prepared
for just about anything.

55
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,214
But nothing like this.

56
00:03:01,178 --> 00:03:03,281
Well, that's because
nothing like this...

57
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,249
has ever happened before.

58
00:03:11,538 --> 00:03:12,618
This is it.

59
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:17,094
Yes.

60
00:03:35,056 --> 00:03:37,005
This is the moment
we've prepared for.

61
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,494
All the devices
have been secured.

62
00:03:40,844 --> 00:03:43,854
The other cells are receiving
their instructions as we speak.

63
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:46,845
The target cities
have been confirmed.

64
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,674
Your routes have been scouted
and cleared.

65
00:03:52,778 --> 00:03:53,742
We're ready.

66
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:57,889
The strike will go off tomorrow
at precisely 8:05 Eastern.

67
00:03:59,482 --> 00:04:01,025
Take a look around you,
gentlemen.

68
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:08,036
These are the faces of the men
who will change the world.

[ www.seriessub.com ]

72
00:04:45,308 --> 00:04:47,141
- Hey, Dad, you got a second?
- Nope.

73
00:04:47,227 --> 00:04:48,732
USAToday'shaving a contest

74
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:51,085
to find the top five
towns under 5,000.

75
00:04:51,086 --> 00:04:52,995
I was thinking we
should submit Jericho.

76
00:04:52,996 --> 00:04:55,303
Why, so some big
developer can come in

77
00:04:55,304 --> 00:04:56,548
and start buying
the town up,

78
00:04:56,549 --> 00:04:59,011
maybe turn Main Street
into a strip mall

79
00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:00,744
with a half a dozen
coffee shops or so?

80
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:02,430
Dad, there are worse things in the world

81
00:05:02,431 --> 00:05:04,228
- than vente frappuccinos.
- Speak English.

82
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:05,656
This could be a good thing.

83
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,414
The kind of headlines
that will bring out voters next month.

84
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:11,964
Son, I am not worried
about beating Gray Anderson.

85
00:05:12,215 --> 00:05:13,159
The people of this town

86
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,935
have kept me in office
for over 20 years.

87
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:16,265
I will earn their votes

88
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:18,426
by doing the job
they hired me to do.

89
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,915
What are you guys doing here?

90
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,249
Your father missed
his checkup this morning

91
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,140
and April was nice enough

92
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:26,616
to take off
her lunch hour

93
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,101
to make a house call.

94
00:05:28,217 --> 00:05:30,455
Well, sorry, Doc, but we're
gonna have to reschedule

95
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:32,768
- for sometime after the election.
- Johnston.

96
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:35,393
You're gonna do this
whether you like it or not.

97
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:37,360
I've had this terrible cold

98
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,675
and you've not been feeling
well for almost a week.

99
00:05:39,752 --> 00:05:40,736
It's a bad one.

100
00:05:40,826 --> 00:05:42,504
Half my staff
has come down with it.

101
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:46,922
Do you want to strip here

102
00:05:46,923 --> 00:05:49,295
or would you like to go
somewhere a little less public?

103
00:05:50,005 --> 00:05:51,009
My office.

104
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:52,837
That's my guy.

105
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:06,902
Yo, yo, how'd it go?

106
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,002
Well, Freddy...

107
00:06:08,003 --> 00:06:09,699
so much for your lucky tie.

108
00:06:12,265 --> 00:06:14,098
"Driver wanted.
Military experience.

109
00:06:14,252 --> 00:06:15,438
Plus, travel opportunities."

110
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,790
Something tells me they're not
talking about the Bahamas.

111
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:18,583
I need a job.

112
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:20,875
You're no driver, man.

113
00:06:21,184 --> 00:06:22,959
You're a pilot,
a freakin' good one.

114
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:25,603
Right now, all I am is broke.

115
00:06:26,606 --> 00:06:28,381
Unless you want
to pay my rent for me.

116
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:29,701
Sorry?!

117
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:31,360
Tell you what I can do, though.

118
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:32,615
Set you up with a drink.

119
00:06:33,696 --> 00:06:34,815
Oye! Mira!

120
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,885
Hit us up with a couple
of cervezas.

121
00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:40,371
What's up with you
and the manners?

122
00:06:40,372 --> 00:06:42,551
I know you didn't just whistle
for me like some dog.

123
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,384
- Oh, baby...
- Don't you "baby" me, baby.

124
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:45,753
You're the worst
tipper in here.

125
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,971
What, that ring on your finger,
that don't count?

126
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,165
Finally pulled
the trigger, Freddy?

127
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,268
- All right.
- You know it, baby.

128
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:01,242
Hey, she's got some
good-looking sisters.

129
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:04,810
Unless you're still all hung up
on that farm girl back in Iowa.

130
00:07:04,868 --> 00:07:06,025
- Kansas.
- Same thing.

131
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,222
No, not the same thing.

132
00:07:12,854 --> 00:07:14,417
Yeah. Hold on a second.

133
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:15,845
Don't go anywhere,
all right?

134
00:07:18,091 --> 00:07:19,345
Where am I gonna go?

135
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:36,265
<i>Sarah, the schedule's changed.

136
00:07:36,517 --> 00:07:39,044
It's happening tomorrow
during the President's address.

137
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:40,355
<i>I'll be there as soon as I can,

138
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:41,908
but there's something
I need to take care of.

139
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:44,692
You get everything together
and I'll meet you back as soon as I can.

140
00:07:44,693 --> 00:07:45,609
Where are you going?

141
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:46,941
<i>To get my kids.

142
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:49,169
<i>Robert, there isn't enough time.

143
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:51,502
Robert!

144
00:08:05,295 --> 00:08:06,029
Anna.

145
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,446
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

146
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:11,295
He's a good man.

147
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,011
I don't know
how good he his, but...

148
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:14,420
he promised to take care of me.

149
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:17,401
- Call me crazy, I believe him.
- What's this?

150
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:19,291
My best man hitting
on my fiance?

151
00:08:19,474 --> 00:08:20,361
Best man?

152
00:08:20,632 --> 00:08:21,847
You gonna make me ask?

153
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,819
You're more a brother to me
than the one I grew up with.

154
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,474
Back at ya.

155
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:26,668
I'm happy to do it.

156
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:28,771
Got some more good news, too.

157
00:08:30,947 --> 00:08:32,163
Uh, sweetie, will you...

158
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:34,285
will you give us
a moment to talk?

159
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,649
What if I told you
I got a gig lined up?

160
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:48,736
Eight weeks,
a hundred G's, all cash.

161
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:49,700
What kind of gig?

162
00:08:49,874 --> 00:08:50,800
The kind we're good at.

163
00:08:51,206 --> 00:08:52,845
Cargo run.
Quick in, quick out.

164
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:54,852
$30,000 up front,
$70,000 when it's done.

165
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:56,607
Where?

166
00:08:57,784 --> 00:08:58,845
Afghanistan.

167
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,627
- No.
- Come on.

168
00:09:03,148 --> 00:09:05,328
You've been looking
for work for what, six months?

169
00:09:05,743 --> 00:09:08,117
We do this one gig
and we are set.

170
00:09:08,118 --> 00:09:11,026
You could open that flight school.
Maybe go home, snag back that girl.

171
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:12,492
Why are you doing this to me?

172
00:09:13,495 --> 00:09:14,730
I can't believe you'd even ask

173
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:16,466
after what we saw over there,
what we did.

174
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:18,434
All we did was
not get killed, J.

175
00:09:18,435 --> 00:09:19,978
Innocent people died, Freddy.

176
00:09:20,286 --> 00:09:21,251
Innocent people.

177
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:23,548
I see it every time
I close my eyes.

178
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:25,187
Which isn't too damn often
these days.

179
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:27,354
Well, we'll be smarter
this time, man.

180
00:09:27,355 --> 00:09:29,083
You know that I got
your back, man.

181
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,187
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:34,055
You're on your own this time.
I can't go back there.

183
00:09:39,032 --> 00:09:40,083
I'll tell you what, Jerry,

184
00:09:40,084 --> 00:09:41,781
you agree
to sit down face to face,

185
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,057
I'll flip you a pair of
open day boxes at Wrigley.

186
00:09:45,003 --> 00:09:46,006
No strings.

187
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:47,974
I swear on a stack
of cheddar dogs.

188
00:09:49,652 --> 00:09:50,173
Great.

189
00:09:51,349 --> 00:09:52,411
6:00 at The Pump Room.

190
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:53,780
See you there.

191
00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:57,003
Chicago again?

192
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,894
Hey, teach, half day?

193
00:10:00,051 --> 00:10:02,444
Feel like helping me
prepare a syllabus or...

194
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:04,990
grading 30 essays on
Orwell's Animal Farm?

195
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:07,190
No, I have a better idea.

196
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,968
Have a sub do that and come
to Chicago with me tonight.

197
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:12,611
That would send
a great message to my students.

198
00:10:12,688 --> 00:10:14,308
I'll write a letter for you.

199
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:17,221
"Dear kids, sorry I can't teach
you ungrateful brats today.

200
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:20,666
"I'm with my fiance getting drunk
on draft beer and having

201
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:23,193
tons of Chicago-style sex."

202
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:25,585
I think it's Chicago-style pizza.

203
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:27,804
That, too.

204
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:30,948
One night.

205
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:32,588
Your students will catch up.

206
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:39,920
Book it.

207
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:41,463
Seriously?

208
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:44,462
You're not going to try
to talk me out of it now, are you?

209
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,864
No. I'm done talking.

210
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,947
<i>46 tackles, three sacks

211
00:10:51,948 --> 00:10:53,491
<i>and a couple of interceptions...

212
00:11:13,253 --> 00:11:13,890
You all right?

213
00:11:16,861 --> 00:11:18,308
I'm worried
about Freddy.

214
00:11:18,617 --> 00:11:19,775
You want a beer?

215
00:11:20,165 --> 00:11:20,744
No.

216
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,522
I think he's in over
his head with something.

217
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:26,277
What are you talking about?

218
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:28,746
These guys started
coming around.

219
00:11:29,518 --> 00:11:30,193
Like...

220
00:11:30,463 --> 00:11:31,872
soldiers but not.

221
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:34,147
They, they came by
again after you left.

222
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:35,710
Well, he's a big boy.

223
00:11:35,844 --> 00:11:37,503
He can hang out
with whoever he chooses.

224
00:11:37,504 --> 00:11:38,410
It's not like that.

225
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:39,718
When he came back,

226
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:42,201
Freddy had a black eye, saying
he's going away for two months

227
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,287
and not to try to find him.

228
00:11:43,288 --> 00:11:44,680
Tell him you don't want him to go.

229
00:11:44,681 --> 00:11:45,803
You don't think I did that?

230
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:47,586
He says he doesn't
have a choice,

231
00:11:47,587 --> 00:11:48,787
that he's doing it for me.

232
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:50,609
What do you want me to do?

233
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:52,150
Help him.

234
00:11:54,432 --> 00:11:56,107
Go with him if you have to.

235
00:11:58,605 --> 00:12:00,476
I know what he did for you
in Iraq.

236
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,100
I know you owe him your life.

237
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:07,197
Yeah.

238
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:10,362
That doesn't appear to be
worth very much, right now.

239
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:14,760
I'm pregnant, Jake.

240
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:17,395
I just...

241
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,303
I have a bad feeling
about all this.

242
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,037
- Robert, what...
- Don't make a scene.

243
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:40,421
What are you doing here?

244
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,639
You need to come with me.

245
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,498
Look, don't tell me
what to do.

246
00:12:44,142 --> 00:12:46,468
You are not allowed
within 500 feet of this family.

247
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,536
Circumstances have changed, Darcy.

248
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:48,883
Mom!

249
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:50,922
Mom.

250
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,299
Oh, my God. The kids.

251
00:12:58,827 --> 00:13:00,172
Unlock the door from the inside.

252
00:13:00,173 --> 00:13:01,897
Alison, it's, it's okay.
It's okay.

253
00:13:05,238 --> 00:13:06,714
You let them out of there right now,

254
00:13:06,715 --> 00:13:08,234
or so help me,
I'll start screaming.

255
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:09,781
No, you listen to me
very carefully.

256
00:13:09,782 --> 00:13:11,576
In five seconds,
I'm getting on this truck

257
00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:13,158
and I am leaving
Washington for good.

258
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,824
And I did not come here
to discuss this with you.

259
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,404
Now you can
either trust me,

260
00:13:19,655 --> 00:13:22,491
and come with us
or you can stay here.

261
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:25,558
But you will never ever
see your children again.

262
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:51,218
Hey, buddy, you in?

263
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:52,510
I'm in.

264
00:13:52,524 --> 00:13:54,009
Glad you changed your mind.

265
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:54,951
I'm telling you,

266
00:13:54,952 --> 00:13:56,861
this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

267
00:13:56,862 --> 00:13:59,610
Then how come this isn't the first time
I've heard you say that?

268
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,365
Do me a favor.

269
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:03,893
Skip ahead in your mind
a couple of months.

270
00:14:04,723 --> 00:14:06,440
Visualize yourself on a...

271
00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:08,061
Mexican beach,

272
00:14:08,332 --> 00:14:10,608
knee deep in bikinis
and Benjamins.

273
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:12,673
I try not to think
that far ahead.

274
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,586
Keeps me from being disappointed
when things go to hell.

275
00:14:15,682 --> 00:14:16,956
My pop once told me

276
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:19,251
if you don't keep an eye
towards where you're going,

277
00:14:19,252 --> 00:14:20,313
you'll never get there.

278
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:22,126
Speaking of eyes...

279
00:14:22,725 --> 00:14:23,959
You should see the other guy.

280
00:14:24,094 --> 00:14:25,213
Fine, introduce us.

281
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:29,071
Who's the job for, Freddy?

282
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:30,017
Don't matter who.

283
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:32,004
They know you, and
your reputation.

284
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,397
I'm not going anywhere
until I know.

285
00:14:38,508 --> 00:14:39,936
It's an offshoot of Ravenwood.

286
00:14:40,823 --> 00:14:42,231
You'll meet 'em, tomorrow

287
00:14:42,232 --> 00:14:44,238
right before we get on a plane.
In the meantime,

288
00:14:44,373 --> 00:14:45,839
all you gotta worry about...

289
00:14:47,614 --> 00:14:48,483
is this.

290
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:52,978
There's three times that
waiting for you

291
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:53,885
when this is over.

292
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:54,791
All we gotta do is

293
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:57,551
run a convoy through enemy territory
without getting killed.

294
00:14:57,634 --> 00:15:00,740
How many times I gotta get your back
before you start believing it, huh?

295
00:16:00,137 --> 00:16:01,005
Seat's all yours.

296
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:02,182
Thank you.

297
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,181
Yeah, I hate, I hate sitting when
I got money on a game.

298
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:08,768
<i>Swung on, it's a high
blast out toward left field.

299
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:11,006
<i>It's way back, and it is gone!

300
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:15,935
Mary Bailey, you owe me five bucks.

301
00:16:15,936 --> 00:16:16,919
Pay up!

302
00:16:18,037 --> 00:16:19,947
Better yet, better yet.
Buy my, uh,

303
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:22,879
good luck charm here,
a drink on me.

304
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,060
Don't waste your money,
I have an expense account.

305
00:16:25,061 --> 00:16:26,488
What is your best wine?

306
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:27,915
Beer.

307
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:30,752
Vodka, rocks.

308
00:16:32,277 --> 00:16:34,785
Did you know that it
is a three-hour cab ride

309
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,792
from the airport to
this godforsaken town?

310
00:16:36,793 --> 00:16:37,926
Scenic, though, ain't it?

311
00:16:38,558 --> 00:16:39,697
If you like corn.

312
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,433
Well, now,
who doesn't like corn?

313
00:16:42,475 --> 00:16:44,790
I mean, you got
corn on the cob,

314
00:16:45,156 --> 00:16:47,105
cornflakes, corn nuts,

315
00:16:47,182 --> 00:16:49,478
corn dogs, cornsicles.

316
00:16:49,768 --> 00:16:50,887
Cornsicles?

317
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:54,494
It's a joke, lady.

318
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,040
Can you not talk
to me, please?

319
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,603
Thank you.

320
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:04,584
- Corn, corn chips?
- Seriously.

321
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:06,070
Don't talk to me.

322
00:17:06,784 --> 00:17:07,459
Bailey's.

323
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,520
<i>Hey, there.

324
00:17:09,114 --> 00:17:09,702
Hi.

325
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:12,123
Am I going to see you this week?

326
00:17:12,258 --> 00:17:13,744
<i>Well, you can see me right now.

327
00:17:14,361 --> 00:17:15,500
<i>Just turn around.

328
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,005
<i>What are you doing here?

329
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:22,233
You have no idea

330
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:24,124
<i>how badly I want
to kiss you right now.

331
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:25,668
Well.

332
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,655
<i>Why don't you step
into my office?

333
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,953
What in the...

334
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,056
heck do we have here?

335
00:17:39,722 --> 00:17:41,767
It's time for some changes, Johnston.

336
00:17:41,902 --> 00:17:43,252
Starting with your diet.

337
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:45,857
A man can't live on that.

338
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,307
Can if he wants to
stay married to me.

339
00:17:50,352 --> 00:17:53,824
Your blood pressure was ten
points over your last checkup.

340
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:56,543
Well, that's just the stress.
It's always up at election time.

341
00:17:56,544 --> 00:17:58,010
Then drop out of the race.

342
00:17:58,376 --> 00:17:59,746
What has gotten into you?

343
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:03,180
Something happened watching April
listen to your heartbeat.

344
00:18:03,678 --> 00:18:05,164
I began to wonder.

345
00:18:05,488 --> 00:18:07,708
How many good years do
we have left together?

346
00:18:07,709 --> 00:18:09,011
Did you hear something I didn't?

347
00:18:09,012 --> 00:18:11,208
'Cause all she told me was
I might be getting a cold.

348
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:11,797
This isn't,

349
00:18:12,163 --> 00:18:14,633
this isn't just about health,
yours or mine.

350
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,642
When you first took office
you made two oaths.

351
00:18:17,758 --> 00:18:19,417
One to the people
of this town,

352
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:21,000
and the other one to me.

353
00:18:22,485 --> 00:18:24,222
Do you rember
what you said?

354
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:25,321
Yeah.

355
00:18:26,536 --> 00:18:29,044
That I would never let the job
come before you and the kids.

356
00:18:30,491 --> 00:18:32,401
I'm just asking
for equal time.

357
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:34,948
I hear you, honey.

358
00:18:44,768 --> 00:18:45,965
You all stay put.

359
00:18:46,814 --> 00:18:48,049
Mom, do something.

360
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,268
Robert, let us go.

361
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:51,715
Please, I'm begging you.

362
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,161
I'll be back
in five minutes.

363
00:18:53,162 --> 00:18:54,454
- And then what?
- And then...

364
00:18:54,493 --> 00:18:55,226
we leave town.

365
00:18:55,322 --> 00:18:57,618
Oh, you're crazy,
I'm not going anywhere with you.

366
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:00,213
Dad, stop. Dad!

367
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:01,775
Let go of her,
Robert!

368
00:19:01,968 --> 00:19:03,203
Listen to me, okay.

369
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:05,861
I would never do
anything to hurt you,

370
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,791
your mother, or your brother.

371
00:19:07,926 --> 00:19:08,755
You believe me?

372
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:11,649
Do you believe me?

373
00:19:12,112 --> 00:19:13,771
I barely know you.

374
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,105
Listen, Robert,
you are scaring Samuel.

375
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:23,513
Unscare him, Darcy.

376
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:36,514
Do you have your cell phone?

377
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:38,097
No, he took it when
he picked me up.

378
00:19:39,563 --> 00:19:40,547
Not mine.

379
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:42,650
Really?
Where is it, honey?

380
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:43,807
In my backpack.

381
00:19:49,344 --> 00:19:50,714
<i>911. What is your emergency?

382
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:05,550
The door was unlocked.

383
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:09,949
I love what you've done
with the place.

384
00:20:10,663 --> 00:20:12,245
What do you want, Agent Hicks?

385
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:13,920
Guess whose name
just popped up

386
00:20:14,016 --> 00:20:16,080
on an international
passenger manifest?

387
00:20:16,177 --> 00:20:17,855
You got me on
a no-fly list now?

388
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:21,173
No, not yet, but...

389
00:20:21,636 --> 00:20:22,736
I thought maybe...

390
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:24,897
we could work out a deal.

391
00:20:29,316 --> 00:20:32,403
You're about to get into bed
with some very bad people, Jake.

392
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,084
Lucky for you,
your timing is perfect.

393
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:37,997
We're looking to nail Ravenwood.

394
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:39,173
They did that?

395
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,019
They've been running weapons
since the start of the war.

396
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:45,048
They'll sell arms to anybody,
even our enemies.

397
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:47,957
We need someone working for us

398
00:20:48,265 --> 00:20:49,577
that they'll
consider credible.

399
00:20:50,252 --> 00:20:51,795
And why would I
say yes to you?

400
00:20:52,972 --> 00:20:53,763
Because...

401
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,297
...you know firsthand
what they're capable of.

402
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:02,214
Sarah, come on, we don't have...

403
00:21:13,096 --> 00:21:14,003
Sarah?

404
00:21:57,431 --> 00:21:58,473
Hold it right there.

405
00:21:58,994 --> 00:22:00,171
Drop the case.

406
00:22:01,927 --> 00:22:03,895
Walk towards me slowly.

407
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,249
Put your hands in the air... now!

408
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:09,991
This your truck?

409
00:22:12,017 --> 00:22:12,711
It's a rental.

410
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:13,830
Moving day, you know?

411
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:15,586
What seems to
be the problem?

412
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:16,667
Open the back.

413
00:22:17,265 --> 00:22:17,940
Okay.

414
00:22:24,866 --> 00:22:25,753
What the hell?

415
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:28,628
Cuff him.

416
00:22:29,747 --> 00:22:30,924
Hands behind your back.

417
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:35,148
Help! Help!
Unlock the door.

418
00:22:35,226 --> 00:22:36,189
- Please.
- It's okay.

419
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,503
We're gonna get you out of here.

420
00:22:37,504 --> 00:22:39,123
- Can you open this door?
- We can't.

421
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,143
Can you unlock the door.

422
00:22:40,144 --> 00:22:40,741
Watch out!

423
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:51,927
Hey, Dad.

424
00:22:52,043 --> 00:22:52,988
- Hey, Eric.
- Mary.

425
00:22:53,355 --> 00:22:55,631
Oh, darlin', would you get him
a beer, too?

426
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:56,847
Sure thing.

427
00:22:57,225 --> 00:22:57,881
Thanks.

428
00:23:04,652 --> 00:23:05,404
So, um...

429
00:23:06,793 --> 00:23:07,951
Why did I ask you here?

430
00:23:08,124 --> 00:23:09,282
Yeah. Is everything okay?

431
00:23:09,552 --> 00:23:10,922
Uh, your mother and I have been...

432
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:13,276
talking about the next
chapter in our lives.

433
00:23:13,277 --> 00:23:14,683
Be more accurate, she's...

434
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:18,020
pointing out how I seem to be
unwilling to turn the page.

435
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:19,794
Sounds like Mom.

436
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,371
When I first took office,
you were in... what? Third grade?

437
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:26,277
Second.

438
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,878
My team won the pee-wee
football trophy that year.

439
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:32,428
I scored two touchdowns
in the championship game.

440
00:23:33,393 --> 00:23:34,820
Hard to remember
back that far.

441
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,016
Maybe because
you didn't make the game, Dad.

442
00:23:37,904 --> 00:23:38,444
Right.

443
00:23:41,106 --> 00:23:41,936
Well,

444
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:44,116
your mother is afraid that if I keep

445
00:23:44,117 --> 00:23:46,006
going the way I'm going,
we're gonna wind up

446
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,550
missing more than
pee-wee football.

447
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,126
And I've been
thinking about it,

448
00:23:51,178 --> 00:23:52,730
and I want to ask
you a question.

449
00:23:56,252 --> 00:23:58,663
If I decided to drop
out of the race,

450
00:23:58,664 --> 00:24:00,515
would you consider
running in my place?

451
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:02,811
What?

452
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:07,145
You'd make a good candidate, son.

453
00:24:07,569 --> 00:24:09,768
You've been here
your whole life, you live clean,

454
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:11,235
unlike your brother Jake.

455
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,318
Plus, selfishly, I'd get to...

456
00:24:13,434 --> 00:24:16,810
step down and still have some influence
over how things were run.

457
00:24:17,032 --> 00:24:18,305
Oh, y-you're serious?

458
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,212
Well, you...

459
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:21,450
You're smart, you're decisive.

460
00:24:21,932 --> 00:24:23,398
Even got yourself a law degree.

461
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:25,019
Which I plan on using some day.

462
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,067
Plan on doing a lot
of things some day.

463
00:24:28,588 --> 00:24:30,286
Nothing you've
been sharing with me.

464
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:34,584
Let me know if you
need anything else.

465
00:24:36,012 --> 00:24:37,884
So, you take the night
and think about it.

466
00:24:37,942 --> 00:24:39,061
Talk to April about it.

467
00:24:39,582 --> 00:24:40,874
It's gonna effect her, too.

468
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:42,572
Yeah.

469
00:24:50,168 --> 00:24:50,554
Hey.

470
00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:52,499
- What's up?
- We need to talk.

471
00:24:55,335 --> 00:24:55,972
What's up?

472
00:24:56,473 --> 00:24:58,171
Cargo, we're transporting
for Ravenwood,

473
00:24:58,172 --> 00:24:59,367
you have any idea what it is?

474
00:24:59,368 --> 00:25:02,224
- I don't ask those kind of questions, man.
- Stinger Missiles. RPGs.

475
00:25:02,225 --> 00:25:04,780
It's not like this was ever some
kind of humanitarian mission.

476
00:25:04,781 --> 00:25:06,752
They've been selling them
to the insurgents, Freddie

477
00:25:06,753 --> 00:25:08,263
They'll be used to kill our own guys!

478
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,883
The Feds are on
to the whole thing.

479
00:25:11,198 --> 00:25:13,283
They want us to help
take down Ravenwood.

480
00:25:13,591 --> 00:25:14,487
Are you crazy?

481
00:25:14,488 --> 00:25:16,351
We don't have a choice.
They're watching us.

482
00:25:16,352 --> 00:25:17,252
So is Ravenwood, man.

483
00:25:17,253 --> 00:25:19,255
I'm more worried about them
than the government.

484
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:20,556
If we don't work with the Feds,

485
00:25:20,557 --> 00:25:22,465
they'll make sure
Ravenwood believes you are.

486
00:25:30,704 --> 00:25:32,308
- You got your money with you?
- What?

487
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:34,053
- Your money.
- Yeah, I can get it.

488
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:36,373
Get Anna, grab whatever you can,
we'll meet in an hour.

489
00:25:36,374 --> 00:25:38,008
- Then what?
- We'll take off tonight.

490
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:40,381
If they come after us, at least
we'll have a head start.

491
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:41,476
All right?

492
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,852
Nobody from school
better see us.

493
00:25:48,566 --> 00:25:51,055
Gonna make it pretty hard for me
to get on that plane tonight

494
00:25:51,056 --> 00:25:52,097
and call in sick tomorrow.

495
00:25:52,098 --> 00:25:54,420
You know, if this was Chicago,
you could walk for miles

496
00:25:54,421 --> 00:25:56,177
without ever running
into anyone you know.

497
00:25:56,178 --> 00:25:57,480
Really? Chicago again?

498
00:25:57,481 --> 00:26:00,682
Plus, there's the pizza,
the Cubs, the culture...

499
00:26:01,492 --> 00:26:02,684
What are you getting at, huh?

500
00:26:02,842 --> 00:26:04,000
Okay, I have a confession.

501
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:05,741
The meeting tomorrow
isn't just a meeting.

502
00:26:05,742 --> 00:26:08,135
It's an interview for a startup
venture capital firm.

503
00:26:08,385 --> 00:26:09,813
Final interview,
actually.

504
00:26:11,896 --> 00:26:13,015
Are you serious?

505
00:26:13,016 --> 00:26:15,581
Well, I thought maybe you could
get to know the city a little.

506
00:26:15,582 --> 00:26:16,893
You might fall in love with it.

507
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,745
You're a jerk.

508
00:26:19,768 --> 00:26:21,697
Emily, we have to at
least talk about it.

509
00:26:21,698 --> 00:26:22,855
We have talked about this.

510
00:26:23,065 --> 00:26:25,570
This is not the kind of opportunity
you can just say no to.

511
00:26:25,571 --> 00:26:25,871
Really?

512
00:26:26,678 --> 00:26:27,114
No.

513
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,506
There. How hard is that?

514
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,507
I cannot believe you.

515
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:32,516
We're supposed to be married
in a few months.

516
00:26:32,517 --> 00:26:33,944
Why do you think I'm doing this?

517
00:26:33,945 --> 00:26:34,976
Because you're selfish,

518
00:26:35,081 --> 00:26:36,355
and you don't listen.

519
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:39,171
I told you when you proposed to me
I didn't want to move.

520
00:26:39,518 --> 00:26:41,197
Now you go behind my back like this?

521
00:26:41,322 --> 00:26:42,913
Yeah, well, screw me for thinking

522
00:26:42,914 --> 00:26:44,688
you might be open
to changing your mind.

523
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:47,447
I mean, what is it about
this town that's got you so...

524
00:26:48,296 --> 00:26:49,395
addicted to it?

525
00:26:50,302 --> 00:26:51,768
This town is my history.

526
00:26:52,732 --> 00:26:54,739
It is everything
that I know and love.

527
00:26:55,212 --> 00:26:56,734
It's where I want
my kids to grow up.

528
00:26:56,735 --> 00:26:58,538
If you don't understand that,
then maybe...

529
00:26:58,539 --> 00:26:59,177
Maybe what?

530
00:27:02,342 --> 00:27:04,329
I'm not getting on that plane
with you tonight.

531
00:27:05,853 --> 00:27:08,940
If you decide to take that job tomorrow,
then don't bother coming back.

532
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:27,615
I'm tired.

533
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:35,294
Allison,

534
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,819
there are two bedrooms
upstairs.

535
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,789
Take your brother up to the one
on the right. That's where you'll sleep.

536
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,941
Who's stuff is all this?
Who lives here?

537
00:27:43,272 --> 00:27:43,966
We do.

538
00:27:46,146 --> 00:27:48,365
Go on upstairs.
I'll be there in a minute.

539
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,622
Come on, Sammy.
I'll read to you.

540
00:27:53,283 --> 00:27:54,885
I don't know what's going on, Robert,

541
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:56,428
and right now, I'm...

542
00:27:57,162 --> 00:27:58,937
I'm too exhausted to fight,

543
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:01,271
but I promise you one thing.

544
00:28:01,493 --> 00:28:03,017
Come tomorrow,
one way or another,

545
00:28:03,018 --> 00:28:04,194
I will have you arrested.

546
00:28:04,387 --> 00:28:06,007
But you know, come tomorrow,

547
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:08,708
a whole lot of things
will be different.

548
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,898
Freddie, come here.

549
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,374
- All right. What happened?!
- Ravenwood.

550
00:28:31,358 --> 00:28:32,805
Those sons a bitches shot me!

551
00:28:32,882 --> 00:28:33,653
Oh, God!

552
00:28:33,691 --> 00:28:35,265
Take it easy,
take it easy.

553
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:41,572
Find Anna.

554
00:28:41,782 --> 00:28:42,852
Make sure she's all right.

555
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:44,623
First, we got to get
you to the hospital.

556
00:28:45,008 --> 00:28:47,062
All I care about
is Anna and my kid.

557
00:28:47,385 --> 00:28:48,509
Get them on that bus.

558
00:28:49,013 --> 00:28:50,676
Then you get the hell
out of here, too!

559
00:28:50,677 --> 00:28:51,966
They're gonna come after you.

560
00:28:52,778 --> 00:28:53,985
Oh, they're coming after you.

561
00:28:53,986 --> 00:28:54,826
Try to stay with me.

562
00:28:54,827 --> 00:28:55,952
<i>911. What is your emergency?

563
00:28:55,953 --> 00:28:57,211
I need an ambulance right away.

564
00:28:57,282 --> 00:28:59,286
My friend's been shot,
he's lost a lot of blood.

565
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:00,019
<i>Is he breathing?

566
00:29:00,393 --> 00:29:01,339
Stay with me, Freddie!

567
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,476
<i>Sir, is he breathing?

568
00:29:03,266 --> 00:29:04,104
Stay with me, man.

569
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:06,052
Come on, man, stay with me.

570
00:29:06,771 --> 00:29:07,590
You're all right.

571
00:29:07,727 --> 00:29:10,068
You're all right.
Stay with me.

572
00:29:14,396 --> 00:29:15,834
I can't believe he's gone.

573
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:26,178
I'm really sorry.

574
00:29:26,612 --> 00:29:27,971
It's not your fault. You did...

575
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:30,239
You did everything that you could.

576
00:29:37,636 --> 00:29:38,353
I don't want it.

577
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:39,280
I don't want it.

578
00:29:39,856 --> 00:29:40,970
It belonged to Freddie.

579
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:42,234
Use it for the baby.

580
00:29:42,597 --> 00:29:44,249
My family will help me.
You keep it.

581
00:29:44,903 --> 00:29:45,275
No.

582
00:29:46,832 --> 00:29:47,741
I promised him.

583
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:50,278
Just put it away.

584
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:56,226
<i>Platform for Houston.
Platform six.

585
00:29:56,431 --> 00:29:57,363
You better go.

586
00:30:07,052 --> 00:30:07,874
Come with me.

587
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:10,735
Come on,
you can start over, too.

588
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:12,924
No, I can't. Not yet.

589
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:14,756
Then where will you go?

590
00:30:21,285 --> 00:30:22,501
You were up early.

591
00:30:22,828 --> 00:30:24,276
Oh, I've been coughing all night.

592
00:30:24,353 --> 00:30:25,685
I didn't want to wake you.

593
00:30:28,463 --> 00:30:29,331
Paris.

594
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:33,112
I hate France.

595
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:36,122
I'm sure they'd be
devastated to hear it.

596
00:30:39,942 --> 00:30:42,547
Studied French and Italian
for four years.

597
00:30:43,203 --> 00:30:45,595
After all those years,
all I can remember is my name,

598
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:46,791
how to count to ten and,

599
00:30:46,965 --> 00:30:49,357
"Would you please pass
that packet of sugar?"

600
00:30:53,716 --> 00:30:55,009
Book the trip.

601
00:30:56,514 --> 00:30:59,735
I don't think they take reservations
six years in advance.

602
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,458
I was thinking
more like Christmas.

603
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:06,121
What the hell.
Book one for Italy, too.

604
00:31:06,584 --> 00:31:07,085
<i>Hello.

605
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:08,880
<i>Hello?

606
00:31:10,462 --> 00:31:11,638
<i>Is anybody there?

607
00:31:12,526 --> 00:31:12,950
<i>Hello?

608
00:31:13,201 --> 00:31:13,953
Jake.

609
00:31:16,886 --> 00:31:18,564
<i>One new message.

610
00:31:19,104 --> 00:31:20,570
Hey, Emily, it's Roger.

611
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:23,637
Just tried your cell,
but I couldn't reach you.

612
00:31:25,026 --> 00:31:27,264
Hopefully, you haven't run off
with the milkman yet.

613
00:31:30,196 --> 00:31:32,164
Last night was terrible.

614
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:33,939
I kept wanting to...

615
00:31:34,171 --> 00:31:37,374
get up and tell the captain
I'd made a horrible mistake,

616
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:38,724
and to turn the plane around.

617
00:31:39,978 --> 00:31:41,637
My home is where you are, babe.

618
00:31:42,852 --> 00:31:45,264
And if that means Jericho, Kansas
for the rest of my life,

619
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:46,826
it'll be a happy one.

620
00:31:49,566 --> 00:31:50,704
I'm flying back tonight.

621
00:31:50,723 --> 00:31:52,286
I get into Wichita at 10:30.

622
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,199
I can't think of anything
I'd rather see

623
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,051
than your beautiful face
when I get home.

624
00:31:59,076 --> 00:32:00,543
And in case you're wondering, I...

625
00:32:00,871 --> 00:32:02,231
I didn't go on that interview.

626
00:32:32,126 --> 00:32:33,553
Oh, excuse me.

627
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:35,462
Excuse me.

628
00:32:35,598 --> 00:32:36,948
Oh, it's you.

629
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,491
Yeah, sorry, not ringing a bell.

630
00:32:38,492 --> 00:32:41,578
Look, I have been standing out
here forever waiting for a cab.

631
00:32:41,695 --> 00:32:44,627
Yeah, I suggest you nicely
ask someone for a ride.

632
00:32:45,014 --> 00:32:47,117
Do you know where
the Richmond Farm is?

633
00:32:48,872 --> 00:32:50,937
Well, yeah, I ought to.
I'm Stanley Richmond.

634
00:32:53,908 --> 00:32:55,605
- You got to be kidding.
- No.

635
00:32:58,982 --> 00:33:01,451
You see, now is the part
where you tell me your name.

636
00:33:02,088 --> 00:33:03,053
Mimi Clark.

637
00:33:03,979 --> 00:33:05,079
Really? Well, it's...

638
00:33:06,391 --> 00:33:07,741
nice to meet you, Ms. Clark.

639
00:33:07,877 --> 00:33:09,498
Do you not read your mail?

640
00:33:10,193 --> 00:33:12,663
Nope. Nothing but bills
and bad news. Why?

641
00:33:13,608 --> 00:33:15,248
Well, this would be a little of both.

642
00:33:15,692 --> 00:33:17,235
I work for the IRS.

643
00:33:18,238 --> 00:33:19,454
And according to our records,

644
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:22,290
you owe more than $180,000
in back taxes.

645
00:33:24,006 --> 00:33:25,607
It's nice to meet you.

646
00:33:35,736 --> 00:33:39,189
<i>Mr. Speaker,
the President of the United States.

647
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:48,564
<i>We all know that
these divisions pale in comparison

648
00:33:48,565 --> 00:33:51,786
<i>to the fundamental dangers posed
by the threat of terrorism.

649
00:34:39,325 --> 00:34:41,620
<i>We have an eternal commitment
to leave the world

650
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,993
<i>a better place for our children
and grandchildren.

651
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:46,019
<i>This has always been our promise.

652
00:34:49,106 --> 00:34:50,167
Not another step.

653
00:34:51,247 --> 00:34:52,212
Where are my kids?

654
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,408
Give me the keys.

655
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:55,241
Darcy, put that gun down,

656
00:34:55,242 --> 00:34:56,977
'cause you don't even
know how to use it.

657
00:34:56,978 --> 00:34:59,713
I don't want to shoot you, Robert,
but so help me, I'm prepared to!

658
00:34:59,714 --> 00:35:00,686
Now, give me the keys!

659
00:35:00,687 --> 00:35:02,037
<i>Mom! Mom, come quick!

660
00:35:02,038 --> 00:35:02,982
Baby, stay outside!

661
00:35:04,195 --> 00:35:06,028
<i>Mom! Mom!
Something's happening!

662
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:16,869
<i>Woody, what are you looking at?

663
00:36:46,022 --> 00:36:46,697
Jake!

664
00:36:46,851 --> 00:36:48,163
Jake, we got
to go outside!

665
00:36:48,549 --> 00:36:49,186
Now!

666
00:36:55,779 --> 00:36:57,168
<i>Help them.
Help them.

667
00:36:57,766 --> 00:36:58,731
Bring them inside.

668
00:37:00,756 --> 00:37:01,971
Some of them were on planes.

669
00:37:03,495 --> 00:37:04,961
Landed in the middle of nowhere.

670
00:37:05,443 --> 00:37:06,909
Been walking for weeks.

671
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,822
They must have gone through hell.

672
00:37:12,985 --> 00:37:14,741
<i>Can you give me
a hand with this?

673
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:20,641
Oh, my God.

674
00:37:23,554 --> 00:37:24,075
Roger.

675
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:34,782
Is it really you?

676
00:37:39,973 --> 00:37:41,304
I thought you were dead.

677
00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:48,056
Come on. Come with me.

678
00:37:56,254 --> 00:37:58,859
We only have another half hour
before the generators shut down.

679
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:01,060
Well, I'm sure they'll
make an exception.

680
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:02,333
Do we have any extra blankets?

681
00:38:02,334 --> 00:38:04,859
I already brought everything
down I could find. Listen, Eric,

682
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,422
these people need medical attention.

683
00:38:07,502 --> 00:38:08,776
You have to find a doctor.

684
00:38:12,682 --> 00:38:13,319
I'm okay.

685
00:38:19,261 --> 00:38:22,135
Are there any more people out there?
We could send a search party.

686
00:38:22,136 --> 00:38:23,139
21 men

687
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,335
and 32 women.

688
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:27,247
I'll do a head count.

689
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:36,380
What happened to you out there?

690
00:38:39,466 --> 00:38:41,203
We waited in that field
for two days

691
00:38:41,204 --> 00:38:42,553
after our plane went down.

692
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:45,755
No one came.

693
00:38:47,048 --> 00:38:47,955
Eventually, I...

694
00:38:48,514 --> 00:38:49,382
went for help.

695
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:50,791
I walked for...

696
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,396
I don't how long.

697
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:55,865
Wound up in this...

698
00:38:56,444 --> 00:38:57,428
refugee camp.

699
00:38:58,065 --> 00:38:58,682
Nebraska.

700
00:39:02,638 --> 00:39:04,027
Most of us are from there.

701
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:08,011
I can't imagine
what you've seen out there.

702
00:39:12,863 --> 00:39:13,403
Roger?

703
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:19,191
I said, I can't imagine
what you've seen.

704
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,242
Couldn't have
imagined it either.

705
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:28,933
Hey, wash up.

706
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:30,110
Dinner's almost ready.

707
00:39:31,113 --> 00:39:31,634
Robert?

708
00:39:32,889 --> 00:39:33,438
Darcy,

709
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:35,628
I need you to keep the kids
in the house for a while

710
00:39:35,629 --> 00:39:37,210
until I can sort something out.

711
00:39:37,847 --> 00:39:38,812
What does that mean?

712
00:39:38,813 --> 00:39:41,300
It means you stay inside,

713
00:39:41,956 --> 00:39:43,693
and you don't answer the door.

714
00:39:46,492 --> 00:39:46,993
Here.

715
00:39:51,065 --> 00:39:52,068
We're playing football.

716
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:54,441
Man, Sam,
that is really cool.

717
00:39:54,807 --> 00:39:56,524
Daddy's gonna put that
on the fridge.

718
00:39:57,797 --> 00:39:59,552
Sam, I want you to go upstairs,

719
00:39:59,553 --> 00:40:00,961
tell your sister dinner's ready.

720
00:40:00,962 --> 00:40:02,022
Okay? Right now.

721
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:07,017
<i>Allison!

722
00:40:09,506 --> 00:40:11,185
Are we in danger, Robert?

723
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,986
I've asked you that question
a thousand times,

724
00:40:14,987 --> 00:40:16,027
you've always said no.

725
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:18,401
I don't...

726
00:40:18,729 --> 00:40:20,619
mean to scare you, D.

727
00:40:27,816 --> 00:40:29,649
All right, we'll do
whatever you say.

728
00:40:32,466 --> 00:40:33,237
I trust you.

729
00:40:42,053 --> 00:40:44,253
My God. Where did
they all come from?

730
00:40:44,928 --> 00:40:47,339
I'm gonna need warm water,
as much as you can make.

731
00:40:47,914 --> 00:40:49,439
I've made a list of the injured.

732
00:41:01,574 --> 00:41:02,481
How's he doing?

733
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,488
I think he might be in shock.

734
00:41:08,596 --> 00:41:09,850
He doesn't want to be treated

735
00:41:09,851 --> 00:41:11,548
until everybody else
has been seen.

736
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:15,213
- Jake, I, um...
- Go.

737
00:41:17,162 --> 00:41:18,435
He's gonna need you.

738
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,041
<i>You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.

739
00:41:33,042 --> 00:41:34,797
<i>You need to keep them
clean and warm.

740
00:41:35,568 --> 00:41:36,802
Do you have a place to stay?

741
00:41:38,018 --> 00:41:39,697
Do you know anyone
in Jericho?

742
00:41:42,494 --> 00:41:43,420
Actually...

743
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:44,983
I do.
