00:00:00,391 --> 00:00:01,991
<i>Previously on</i> Jericho

2
00:00:02,291 --> 00:00:03,591
Some of them were on planes

3
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:05,191
that landed in the middle of nowhere.

4
00:00:05,691 --> 00:00:06,991
They've been walking for weeks.

5
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,091
They must have gone through hell.

6
00:00:09,491 --> 00:00:10,491
Oh, my God.

7
00:00:12,491 --> 00:00:14,391
At the current levels of consumption,

8
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:17,790
we will be completely
out of gas and diesel in two weeks.

9
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,790
There's a woman in that
group of refugees that

10
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,991
Bill is processing.
I think you should talk to her.

11
00:00:22,591 --> 00:00:23,591
Hello, Rob.

12
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,890
Someone on my team sold us all out.

13
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:26,990
You're smart enough to know

14
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:29,391
that they would say anything
to get you to talk, Sarah.

15
00:00:30,591 --> 00:00:32,391
Get the package.

16
00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:46,091
We're the United States Marines,

17
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:47,491
and we're here to help.

18
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:49,490
... and those are to restore lights,

19
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:52,891
power and infrastructure
to Kansas, one town at a time.

20
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,390
Something's wrong about all this,
all right? Trust me.

21
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:02,532
They've got somebody on the edge of town
pretending to be their headquarters.

22
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:03,991
Is any of this real?

23
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:06,390
- The gun's real.
- Hands up. Get them up!

24
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:07,891
What the hell do we do with them?

25
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:09,891
You will leave your weapons on the tank,

26
00:01:10,191 --> 00:01:11,391
and you will move out!

27
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:13,091
- What do we do with that?
- Stanley,

28
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:14,491
got room in your barn?

29
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:16,391
- Seriously?
- Why not?

30
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:19,391
Never know when you might need a tank.

31
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:49,291
You're making too much noise.

32
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:50,491
Sorry.

33
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:52,691
Where did it go?

34
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:55,991
There it is.

35
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:08,891
- It's locked.
- We shouldn't go in.

36
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:13,891
Go in here.

37
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:16,091
- Why do I have to?
- So we can eat.

38
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:27,091
You see it?

39
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:29,391
Katie?

40
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:41,491
<i>Come on, Jake,
there's a line here.

41
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:42,891
<i>Did you hear about the tank?

42
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:44,491
<i>Those Marines coming or what?

43
00:02:44,591 --> 00:02:47,391
<i>Everybody, just calm down!
You'll get your share.

44
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:50,791
<i>You'll get your rations!

45
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:53,291
<i>People, please, back up!

46
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:55,991
How is Gray handling this?

47
00:02:56,057 --> 00:02:57,090
You better get in there.

48
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:59,091
I think we really screwed
ourselves this time.

49
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:02,490
You said everyone in the shelter gets
half-rations until the Marines come.

50
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:04,991
Well, the Marines aren't coming,
and you've known all along.

51
00:03:05,191 --> 00:03:06,891
We did the best that we could.

52
00:03:06,964 --> 00:03:08,890
People had to believe
that help was on the way.

53
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:09,990
And you know what?

54
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:13,091
Half-rations is a lot more than
those refugees had before they got here.

55
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:14,891
Did you know about this?

56
00:03:15,091 --> 00:03:16,891
The Marines...
That they were con artists?

57
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,591
Yeah, but we didn't give them
any of our supplies.

58
00:03:20,691 --> 00:03:23,591
And Gray is right. The last thing
this town needs is to lose hope.

59
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:26,091
Hope won't keep
my friends from starving.

60
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,691
I've got one woman too weak to walk.

61
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,191
It's a mathematical problem.

62
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:32,790
We've got your friends,
plus another 50 who migrated here.

63
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,791
That's too many people,
and not enough food.

64
00:03:34,891 --> 00:03:37,341
We'll just have to figure out
how to make what we have last.

65
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:38,891
I say the first thing we do,

66
00:03:38,991 --> 00:03:40,791
is stop giving it away to strangers.

67
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,491
What if we cut
the food rations in half,

68
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:30,791
again?

69
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,990
It's more than the food.
What about medicine?

70
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:34,207
Those refugees came here sick.

71
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,290
They've been burning through
our meds for a month.

72
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,091
Can we make it to spring, Harry?

73
00:04:38,691 --> 00:04:40,091
Some of us can. Not all.

74
00:04:41,091 --> 00:04:42,891
Crime's been going up
since they got here.

75
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,690
Crime's been going up
since the bombs.

76
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:47,191
It's got to be done.
The numbers speak for themselves.

77
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,090
Just look at 'em.

78
00:04:48,123 --> 00:04:50,291
I don't need to look at 'em.
I see them in my sleep.

79
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,191
What are you going to do?

80
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:57,691
Folks?

81
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,791
Folks, listen up!

82
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:01,690
I am sorry to say that

83
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:04,991
the town no longer has the resources
to take care of you.

84
00:05:05,391 --> 00:05:06,991
<i>What?
Where are we supposed to go?

85
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,490
So if you could please
gather up your belongings,

86
00:05:10,491 --> 00:05:12,890
you will be escorted
to a FEMA camp out

87
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:15,391
- near I-70.
- We've been to those FEMA camps.

88
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,991
We barely made it out
alive the first time.

89
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:22,191
FEMA has medicine and supplies,
and we don't.

90
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:23,891
You heard the mayor.

91
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,991
You need to start packing up.

92
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:28,391
What are you going to do,
put us in jail?

93
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:29,591
Great.

94
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,591
If I didn't have to do this,

95
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:33,991
- I wouldn't.
- We've been working!

96
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,391
Okay? We've been chopping wood!

97
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:38,891
Jessica's been helping you
with your medical center.

98
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:42,891
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:44,491
But if you put us out on the...

100
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,591
This isn't a debate.

101
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,291
You're right.

102
00:05:51,691 --> 00:05:52,791
'Cause we're staying.

107
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
Anything?

108
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,900
Static.

109
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,399
No news.

110
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,299
I guess now the secret
about the tank is out,

111
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,699
there's no need to hide the radio.

112
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,000
Yeah. I'll take it down
to Bailey's later.

113
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,600
We can all be annoyed together.

114
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,700
Emily.

115
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,399
Gray's trying to kick out the refugees.

116
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,248
They barricaded themselves
inside the church.

117
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:39,500
Was anybody hurt?

118
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,899
Is there another door?

119
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,300
No. They blocked that one, too.

120
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Look, Roger, I'm sorry, but...

121
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,049
You lie about the Marines,

122
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,499
you get caught, you need someone
to blame, so you pick them.

123
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,099
We have taken in almost
a hundred people since the bombs.

124
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,800
Roger, you brought over 50 yourself.

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,100
We've done our part.

126
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,300
It's time for somebody else
to share the burden.

127
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,200
- Now, these FEMA camps...
- Those FEMA camps are jungles.

128
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:07,699
Putting anybody out on those streets
is a death sentence.

129
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,800
You've been out there.
You know that.

130
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,799
Look, it comes down to ressources.

131
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,932
All right? And people of Jericho
have to come first.

132
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,616
It's 100 of them or 100 of us.

133
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Let me work on Gray.

134
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,500
You and Emily try and talk
some sense into the refugees.

135
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Don't give Gray
a reason to make this worse.

136
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,550
All right? Gray can't send
these people away like this.

137
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
It's his call.

138
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,000
Well, isn't there
something we can do?

139
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,499
Give them warm clothing for the trip.

140
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,400
We've given away
everything we can spare.

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Well, there's...

142
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,900
What?

143
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,500
April's things?

144
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,400
Kyle, what are you doing?

145
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,099
We're not leaving here without a fight.

146
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,100
- This is a bad idea.
- What should we do?

147
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,700
We take down the barricade.

148
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,799
We go out unarmed.
We look them in the eye,

149
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,799
and we ask them to stay
till the end of winter.

150
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,900
Look them in the eye.

151
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,100
That's your plan?

152
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,900
- You don't know this town.
- Apparently, that makes two of us.

153
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,800
Where did you get the food from?

154
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,300
You stole it.

155
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,399
You broke into people's houses?

156
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,799
It's not like you didn't do the same
thing when we were out there.

157
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,199
Yeah, well, this is different.
This town took care of us!

158
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,700
We took care of us!

159
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,800
Because we knew,
one day, this town wouldn't.

160
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
What do you see?

161
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,400
Looks like Simmons has got
his nephew guarding the shed.

162
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't think I can get in.

163
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,400
You have to.

164
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,100
You traded them for that gas,
and they're holding out on you.

165
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,500
You can't let these farmers
get away with it anymore.

166
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,700
It's easy for you to say.

167
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,300
I'll go this time.

168
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,300
Very funny.

169
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,700
What? You think you're
the only badass here?

170
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,200
- Uh... yeah.
- You want to bet?

171
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,700
Forget it, Skylar. Simmons is not
a pushover like Frederickson.

172
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,000
Neither am I.

173
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,700
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

174
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,900
You could get hurt.

175
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,100
You're worried about me?

176
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,900
That's so sweet.

177
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,800
Now, watch and learn.

178
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,700
Found them!

179
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,499
Tear gas?

180
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,515
Gray, those things been
sitting around for years.

181
00:10:01,516 --> 00:10:04,200
You can't do this, Gray.
I've given these people sanctuary.

182
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:05,799
Reverend, this is a police matter now.

183
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,499
You have no right
to assault these people.

184
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,599
They've committed no crimes.

185
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,399
- They'll be my responsibility.
- What, are you going to feed them?

186
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,700
What, you got a little hospital
down there, Reverend?

187
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,300
No, I didn't think so.

188
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,000
What's that sound?

189
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,600
They're boarding up the windows.

190
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,699
There were half a dozen other places
we could have stopped,

191
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,200
but you kept talking like Jericho
was the end of the freakin' rainbow.

192
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,500
So we kept walking...
losing people... for this.

193
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,599
Out of my way, Johnston!
I know what I'm doing.

194
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,000
You know why we never used those?
A little thing called Waco happened.

195
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,100
The FBI used tear gas,

196
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,799
and they swear it didn't start
that fire, but it could have.

197
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,331
- You ready to live with that?
- Dad!

198
00:10:47,332 --> 00:10:48,900
We can't hold off a town.

199
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,599
- It's too big a gamble.
- It's not a gamble for you!

200
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,899
You get to go home
to a warm bed every night.

201
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,700
I told you... I'm with you.

202
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,000
What happens when
we get kicked out of this town?

203
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
<i>Come on!

204
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,900
What are you doing?
Get out of the way!

205
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,500
<i>She's got no pulse.

206
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,400
Hank! Hank!

207
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,099
- Skylar!
- Thank God. There are men on the road!

208
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,900
- Men? What men?
- They're with Ravenwood.

209
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,200
Is your uncle here?

210
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,599
- No, it's just me.
- We have to hide!

211
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,200
Okay, yeah. Come on!

212
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,000
How many were there?

213
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,400
I don't know. Five, maybe six.

214
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,600
I can't see them.

215
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:16,866
You know what?

216
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:19,100
I bet you have
a better view from the hayloft.

217
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,700
- I'm right behind you.
- Okay.

218
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,700
Skylar!

219
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,700
Stop!

220
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,700
It's okay. I'll wait.

221
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,499
One of the refugees is still out there.

222
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,399
You have the rangers search the barns.

223
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,600
Use dogs if it'll help.

224
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,400
And the rest of them?

225
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,200
Take them to the med center,
get them fixed up, Harry.

226
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,400
Then send them away.

227
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,100
What about the extra food
you promised them?

228
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,599
Give it to them.

229
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,000
- After what they did to us?
- Will you just do it,

230
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,000
before somebody else gets hurt?!

231
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,400
It's not too late.

232
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,399
Just let them stay until spring.

233
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,200
You think I haven't tried
to make that work?

234
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,600
The numbers don't add up.

235
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,900
- They're good people, Gray. Just...
- And?!

236
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,100
Good people are dying every day!

237
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,399
Someone finally has to tell the truth.

238
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,800
It's musical chairs out there.
The music has stopped!

239
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,200
Oh, my God!

240
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,999
Oh, my God, get away from me!

241
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,100
Get away from me!

242
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,899
A hundred counts of murder, Gray.

243
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,499
That's what they should charge you with
if you send them away.

244
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,299
We have been feeding them
and we have been heating the shelter.

245
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,099
We've been taking
from my friends

246
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,900
to give to strangers,
so don't you dare lecture me!

247
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,800
Whatever happens to them is on you!

248
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,899
Let me go, please!

249
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,800
- I don't want to hurt you!
- Just let me go, please!

250
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,199
You're not leaving
until this is resolved!

251
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,000
This is resolved!
Get out of my way!

252
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,600
- They're not going anywhere.
- You want to bet?

253
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,000
Just take whatever you want!
Just get out!

254
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,900
And go where?!

255
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,400
I got the entire police force
guarding the refugees,

256
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,000
and one way or another,
they're going.

257
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,000
Hey, stop it!

258
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,600
All right, stop it!

259
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
What's going on?
What happened?

260
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,199
Gray pulled a gun.
It was an accident.

261
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,400
Like hell! He shot me!

262
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,199
There's so much blood.

263
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,499
He needs a doctor.

264
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,099
- Get-get Kenchy.
- No, get Jessica.

265
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,699
Shut up!
You're not running things!

266
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,700
Get Jessica, please, all right?
I trust her.

267
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,900
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

268
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,400
What are you looking for?

269
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,800
Superglue.

270
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,000
The sole on my boot came apart
after a couple hundred miles.

271
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,600
My son's shoes might fit you.

272
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,200
I'd rather fix these.

273
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Why?

274
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
They're all I have left that are mine.

275
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,500
Where are you going to go?

276
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,500
I don't know really.

277
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,000
My family was in Chicago.

278
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,799
I wish there was more
that we could do.

279
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,000
Ma'am,

280
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,499
there are empty houses
all over Jericho,

281
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,300
and we sleep in a shelter.

282
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,000
Those are our neighbors' homes.

283
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,399
They were gone
when the bombs went off.

284
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,100
They're coming back.

285
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Well, wherever your neighbors are,

286
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,400
I hope nobody's kicking them
out of town in the middle of winter.

287
00:20:38,064 --> 00:20:39,705
What the hell happened in there?

288
00:20:39,744 --> 00:20:41,275
- Gray's bleeding badly.
- I'm busy.

289
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:42,950
- I need your help!
- Get Kenchy.

290
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,984
Look, you're the only
one Roger trusts.

291
00:20:45,031 --> 00:20:47,034
You want me to save
Gray Anderson?

292
00:20:47,385 --> 00:20:49,059
If Gray dies, so does Roger.

293
00:20:49,278 --> 00:20:51,406
People aren't just going
to let it go. Please?

294
00:21:00,014 --> 00:21:01,360
We can all get out of this.

295
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:02,893
I was just trying to help them.

296
00:21:02,924 --> 00:21:05,224
Now... there's no way the
town lets them stay.

297
00:21:05,318 --> 00:21:07,227
It was an accident.
I saw it.

298
00:21:07,931 --> 00:21:09,026
Gray...

299
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:10,595
just until spring.

300
00:21:10,845 --> 00:21:11,972
That's all I ask.

301
00:21:12,957 --> 00:21:13,970
Come on!

302
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:16,112
You were right.

303
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:17,244
This is on me.

304
00:21:17,338 --> 00:21:18,449
I brought them here.

305
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:19,637
I did it...

306
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:21,562
I did it for my own reasons.

307
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:23,533
But don't punish them,

308
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:24,991
I'm begging you.

309
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:26,653
Just till spring.

310
00:21:27,436 --> 00:21:28,449
Go to hell.

311
00:21:31,926 --> 00:21:33,756
I've got Jessica. Let us in.

312
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:39,170
You need to let me look at him.

313
00:21:40,452 --> 00:21:42,126
You give them a chance...

314
00:21:43,018 --> 00:21:44,129
...I'll give you a chance.

315
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,788
I was going to give you
food, an escort.

316
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:48,462
We wouldn't survive out there...

317
00:21:48,477 --> 00:21:50,511
you know that.
We have to stay here.

318
00:21:51,356 --> 00:21:53,155
Why would you die over this?!

319
00:21:55,142 --> 00:21:56,675
He's our only leverage.

320
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,921
Roger, this isn't you.

321
00:21:59,578 --> 00:22:02,144
I survived out there
for three months.

322
00:22:02,316 --> 00:22:05,680
You have no idea what
I can do if I have to.

323
00:22:57,351 --> 00:22:59,056
- Any sign of her?
- No.

324
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:01,598
Check the buildings.

325
00:23:01,896 --> 00:23:04,242
She's got to be around
here somewhere.

326
00:23:21,248 --> 00:23:22,249
Hold up.

327
00:23:22,296 --> 00:23:24,080
She changed the location again.

328
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,707
Meet you back at the road.

329
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:05,768
Bill, don't!

330
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,264
You think I want to?

331
00:24:09,336 --> 00:24:12,056
Roger's a friend of mine, but I can't
let the mayor bleed to death.

332
00:24:12,072 --> 00:24:14,325
What if you miss?
What if you hit Emily?

333
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:15,623
Get off me.

334
00:24:16,093 --> 00:24:18,416
If I get the shot, Jake...
I'm taking it.

335
00:24:18,905 --> 00:24:19,922
Damn it.

336
00:24:25,469 --> 00:24:27,034
We have to get him help.

337
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:28,411
He didn't want to do this.

338
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:30,429
It doesn't matter what
we want, does it?

339
00:24:30,507 --> 00:24:31,884
It matters what we do.

340
00:24:32,463 --> 00:24:34,418
I tried to get us all back here.

341
00:24:34,903 --> 00:24:37,688
I promised them if we
just stuck together.

342
00:24:38,055 --> 00:24:39,635
- And you did.
- Yeah.

343
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,139
Emily, most of us made it back.

344
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,657
19 of us didn't.

345
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:53,921
What's going on?

346
00:24:56,487 --> 00:24:59,444
And I remember...
every one of their faces.

347
00:25:09,768 --> 00:25:11,450
- Get away from the window!
- Jake, what are you doing?!

348
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:13,656
- I told you to stay out!
- Get away from the window!

349
00:25:13,808 --> 00:25:15,373
Get away from the window!

350
00:25:16,022 --> 00:25:17,774
Roger, get away from
the window!

351
00:25:19,581 --> 00:25:21,365
Roger, get away from
the window!

352
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,243
If you want your friends to live...

353
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,231
you better back the hell off
right now and listen to me!

354
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:42,999
Roger, he's here to help.

355
00:25:43,062 --> 00:25:44,173
I'm listening.

356
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:47,283
What if we give you
transportation?

357
00:25:47,767 --> 00:25:49,191
And food and fuel?

358
00:25:49,864 --> 00:25:51,319
So we can die out there?

359
00:25:51,382 --> 00:25:53,118
- Guy is that what you think about?
- No!

360
00:25:53,197 --> 00:25:55,121
You can make it to
the migration trail.

361
00:25:55,246 --> 00:25:56,560
Head south and beat the winter.

362
00:25:56,787 --> 00:25:58,336
It's not your decision to make.

363
00:25:58,367 --> 00:26:00,229
Won't be yours either if you're dead.

364
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:02,560
You can't keep us in here forever.

365
00:26:02,685 --> 00:26:03,968
This will end.

366
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:06,259
And when it does,
you can forget about staying.

367
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,043
They will kick you out
with nothing.

368
00:26:17,547 --> 00:26:18,673
I'm going to need guns.

369
00:26:19,158 --> 00:26:20,206
I can't give you guns.

370
00:26:20,253 --> 00:26:22,897
I can't protect a hundred
people with what I have.

371
00:26:25,343 --> 00:26:27,705
But you let Jessica take Gray
to the medical center.

372
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:29,051
He's not leaving.

373
00:26:29,176 --> 00:26:32,837
Roger, if that bullet is still in him,
I'm going to have to open him up.

374
00:26:36,546 --> 00:26:37,657
Is it a deal?

375
00:26:45,621 --> 00:26:47,663
You make sure everything's ready.

376
00:26:48,242 --> 00:26:49,337
I'll let him go.

377
00:27:07,194 --> 00:27:08,274
Hey, Allie.

378
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:10,402
Dad, you can't be around here.

379
00:27:10,403 --> 00:27:11,559
Mom will freak out.

380
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:13,468
I won't stay long.
Come on.

381
00:27:22,785 --> 00:27:23,833
So...

382
00:27:25,147 --> 00:27:27,416
I just wanted to know
how you were doing.

383
00:27:28,634 --> 00:27:31,106
Settling in okay at
Jimmy's place?

384
00:27:31,778 --> 00:27:34,282
- Yeah, he just never stops talking.
- No...

385
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:37,020
He doesn't.

386
00:27:40,947 --> 00:27:42,058
ow's Sam?

387
00:27:43,388 --> 00:27:45,422
You know, he gets scared.

388
00:27:46,157 --> 00:27:47,190
And you?

389
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,911
I'm fine.

390
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:50,974
Look...

391
00:27:52,507 --> 00:27:54,525
that thing you had
to do to Sarah...

392
00:27:55,746 --> 00:27:57,733
I know how that can
change people.

393
00:27:58,077 --> 00:27:59,078
Dad...

394
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,251
don't worry about me.

395
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:03,390
I'm not Sam, and
I'm not Mom.

396
00:28:06,566 --> 00:28:07,646
So...

397
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:11,278
you're not going to live with
us anymore... are you ?

398
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:13,844
I don't think it's a good
idea right now.

399
00:28:18,275 --> 00:28:19,417
Then don't worry.

400
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:21,263
I'll take care of them.

401
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:22,828
Come here.

402
00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:27,678
You are not me.

403
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:55,215
Thank you for helping me.

404
00:28:55,262 --> 00:28:56,702
Just try to keep still.

405
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:02,084
It's my job, you know.

406
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:04,262
I didn't want to do it.

407
00:29:04,888 --> 00:29:05,889
I had to.

408
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:09,159
We all have our jobs to do,
whether we want to do them or not.

409
00:29:12,924 --> 00:29:14,238
Just hang on.

410
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,532
The bus is here.

411
00:29:40,664 --> 00:29:42,385
When do you think you'll come back?

412
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:43,543
After this...

413
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:46,829
he's never going to
let me come back.

414
00:29:50,036 --> 00:29:52,086
Maybe I shouldn't have
brought them here.

415
00:29:52,195 --> 00:29:53,697
There were other places...

416
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:54,996
camps...

417
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,717
towns we heard about.

418
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:00,870
But I had to see you.

419
00:30:06,312 --> 00:30:07,767
A refugee broke into the house.

420
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,144
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

421
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,302
I'll get the guys.

422
00:30:10,521 --> 00:30:11,569
Listen to me.

423
00:30:11,757 --> 00:30:13,431
We can't let this happen.

424
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:16,544
We're ready.

425
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:22,568
Get up.

426
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:26,045
Wait, you can't take him.

427
00:30:26,687 --> 00:30:28,110
Once my friends and I...

428
00:30:28,282 --> 00:30:29,847
are safely out of town...

429
00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:30,963
I'll let him go.

430
00:30:30,989 --> 00:30:32,757
He'll be dead by then.

431
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,381
You can't let them go out there.

432
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:41,542
A woman died on Main Street today.

433
00:30:42,011 --> 00:30:44,311
I didn't even know her name.

434
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,498
Did you?

435
00:30:46,163 --> 00:30:48,901
If you need a hostage,
take me.

436
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,530
Think of our neighbors who
haven't made it back yet.

437
00:30:52,593 --> 00:30:54,502
That's who they are.

438
00:30:55,636 --> 00:30:57,246
Now my family can feed two people.

439
00:30:57,247 --> 00:30:59,281
Now my family can feed two people.

440
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:02,721
Who else here is willing
to share their rations?

441
00:31:04,473 --> 00:31:05,709
They're coming out!

442
00:31:10,223 --> 00:31:11,631
All right, move back!

443
00:31:12,883 --> 00:31:14,056
Move back!

444
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:15,667
Come on, people, we can do this.

445
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:16,919
I know we can, please.

446
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:20,658
Thank you, Bob. Yeah.

447
00:31:21,003 --> 00:31:23,021
Right. Good.
Who else?

448
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,587
Come on, who else? Please.

449
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,214
Please.

450
00:31:27,582 --> 00:31:28,958
Everybody, get back!

451
00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:32,150
Get back!

452
00:31:32,965 --> 00:31:34,295
Keep your guns down.

453
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,032
Keep them down.

454
00:31:39,317 --> 00:31:40,772
Move back!
Move back!

455
00:31:41,773 --> 00:31:43,249
- Move back!
- My God.

456
00:31:45,658 --> 00:31:46,666
Roger...

457
00:31:48,427 --> 00:31:49,585
it's over.

458
00:31:53,296 --> 00:31:54,704
They can stay.

459
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:57,818
We found them homes.

460
00:31:58,741 --> 00:32:00,649
Just put the gun down, Roger.

461
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:02,222
You won.

462
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,619
Come on, put it down.

463
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,180
How's the mayor?

464
00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:41,294
Jessica did a great job.
He's, um...

465
00:32:42,092 --> 00:32:44,768
he's lost a lot of blood,
but he's stable.

466
00:32:48,189 --> 00:32:50,567
We talked him into letting
the others stay.

467
00:32:54,518 --> 00:32:55,535
But, um...

468
00:32:57,553 --> 00:32:58,554
Not me.

469
00:33:09,439 --> 00:33:10,503
Well...

470
00:33:12,247 --> 00:33:14,062
I'd say I'd call you, but...

471
00:33:26,403 --> 00:33:27,904
I'm coming with you.

472
00:33:28,264 --> 00:33:29,422
No, you're not.

473
00:33:29,532 --> 00:33:31,159
Roger, I-I am, so...

474
00:33:32,254 --> 00:33:33,349
I did this

475
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:35,964
so the people I love
can be safe here.

476
00:33:36,856 --> 00:33:40,266
I'm not taking the person I love
the most out on those roads.

477
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,206
I can handle it.

478
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:45,140
I can't.

479
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:19,348
So... what do you think?

480
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,274
Well, it's no Saks Fifth Avenue,
but...

481
00:34:22,884 --> 00:34:24,089
it's pretty great.

482
00:34:24,558 --> 00:34:26,263
Thanks to all the deals we made,

483
00:34:26,294 --> 00:34:28,171
we have a real trading post now.

484
00:34:35,884 --> 00:34:36,948
Hi, Mr. Simmons.

485
00:34:37,605 --> 00:34:39,216
Hank.
- What?!

486
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,173
You think this is a joke?
I could've shot you.

487
00:34:42,273 --> 00:34:44,322
Talk to your uncle, Hank.
He's the one that broke the deal.

488
00:34:44,323 --> 00:34:46,309
You're just a real big man,
aren't you?

489
00:34:47,248 --> 00:34:50,127
Just give me my horse
and the gas, and I'll be on my way.

490
00:34:51,003 --> 00:34:53,245
The horse is tied up in the alley,
but the gas is mine.

491
00:34:53,276 --> 00:34:54,809
I'm through playing
games with you.

492
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:56,139
Hank, get the gas.

493
00:35:06,932 --> 00:35:08,419
Meet my new employees.

494
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:37,682
This is, um,
Jim and Judy Moore's house.

495
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:40,617
They were visiting their grandchildren

496
00:35:41,774 --> 00:35:43,663
just outside of Philadelphia.

497
00:35:49,916 --> 00:35:52,129
Rations are on Tuesday.

498
00:35:52,657 --> 00:35:55,073
We'll be by to share them with you.

499
00:36:01,266 --> 00:36:02,951
Mrs. Green.

500
00:36:05,814 --> 00:36:07,114
Thank you.

501
00:37:56,164 --> 00:37:58,965
We got together
some canned food and water.

502
00:37:59,656 --> 00:38:01,402
I wish I had more.

503
00:38:13,297 --> 00:38:15,124
Nothing I say is going to...

504
00:38:15,774 --> 00:38:17,479
is going to sound right, so...

505
00:38:18,982 --> 00:38:20,951
Are you really sad to see me go?

506
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,159
It's not about that.

507
00:38:25,241 --> 00:38:26,419
Here.

508
00:38:34,255 --> 00:38:36,204
Take Cedar Run first, it's clear,

509
00:38:36,205 --> 00:38:37,808
and then head to New Bern.

510
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,264
Heather, Stanley, my brother,

511
00:38:40,265 --> 00:38:41,950
they can help you
once you're there.

512
00:38:42,355 --> 00:38:44,142
I know my way around.

513
00:40:03,808 --> 00:40:07,208
<i>Bodies were found

514

00:40:12,386 --> 00:40:14,837
Wait, I've heard that voice before.

517
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:18,074
Oh, yeah, that's the guy that does
the farm report. It's real news.

518
00:40:18,433 --> 00:40:20,036
<i>... to research laboratories.

Jimmy, what is it?
