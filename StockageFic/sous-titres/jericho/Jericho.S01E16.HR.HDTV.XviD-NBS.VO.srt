<i>Previously on </i>Jericho

2
00:00:01,727 --> 00:00:03,856
When were you planning
on telling me about the baby?

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,420
A bad marriage doesn't get better
because you add a kid.

4
00:00:06,497 --> 00:00:08,966
I didn't want you to stay with me
because of the baby, Eric.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,530
Heather!

6
00:00:10,954 --> 00:00:11,997
My God.

7
00:00:13,149 --> 00:00:14,957
Uh... Jake, this is Ted Lewis.

8
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,222
We grew up together
over in New Bern.

9
00:00:17,223 --> 00:00:18,612
This is Russell and Mike.

10
00:00:18,613 --> 00:00:19,621
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.

11
00:00:19,622 --> 00:00:21,163
With a dozen full-size windmills,

12
00:00:21,164 --> 00:00:22,442
you could power the whole town.

13
00:00:22,443 --> 00:00:24,898
I'm going to help turn the lights on
for everyone back home.

14
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,101
- Just going to leave?
- It won't be for very long.

15
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:31,986
I have something
in my possession

16
00:00:32,138 --> 00:00:35,170
and it puts you, me and the kids
in danger here.

17
00:00:35,188 --> 00:00:37,068
Sarah is not on our side.

18
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,913
She's not here to help us.

19
00:00:39,012 --> 00:00:40,940
Hawkins is starting
to put the pieces together.

20
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:43,249
- He needs to be eliminated.
- I know.

21
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,880
Why are you stalling on this one?

22
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,190
How can I be sure
you won't follow me?

23
00:00:54,191 --> 00:00:55,206
I won't follow you.

24
00:00:55,207 --> 00:00:57,168
Not if I take your son with me,
you won't.

25
00:01:57,671 --> 00:02:00,029
Honey, you look tired.

26
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:01,571
You getting enough sleep?

27
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:03,303
Almost seven hours.

28
00:02:03,598 --> 00:02:05,099
- Where?
- In my office.

29
00:02:05,568 --> 00:02:07,632
Sleeping in your office
doesn't count.

30
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,761
You're going to give
the baby a crick in its neck.

31
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,490
You're going to make
a terrific grandmother.

32
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:13,210
- I know.
- You're Dr. Green? - Yes.

33
00:02:13,514 --> 00:02:15,337
Jessica Williams.
Nice to meet you.

34
00:02:15,672 --> 00:02:17,937
Mr. Ostrowski says
he's having chest pains.

35
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:20,027
He doesn't want anybody
to look at him but you.

36
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,359
Are you the doctor
who came in with the refugees?

37
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,299
Close. Third-year med student,
University of Chicago.

38
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,390
And I prefer
"visitor" to "refugee."

39
00:02:27,556 --> 00:02:29,406
I'm sorry.
Thanks for the help.

40
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:30,974
Don't thank me.

41
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:33,105
I'm just working here
'cause I get to sleep in a bed

42
00:02:33,106 --> 00:02:34,686
instead of the church basement.

43
00:02:35,504 --> 00:02:36,683
Where do I start?

44
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:40,530
Pneumonia,
malnutrition, hypothermia.

45
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:42,192
Just grab a chart
and pick a patient.

46
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:47,111
- Mr. Hawkins?
- Hey, Jim.

47
00:02:47,594 --> 00:02:49,242
Hope I didn't wake the kids.

48
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:50,770
No, you're okay.

49
00:02:51,883 --> 00:02:53,799
Mine are the same way.
Up at all hours.

50
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:55,118
Worse when we had TV.

51
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:56,854
Is there something
I can do for you, Jim?

52
00:02:58,018 --> 00:02:59,158
Sorry. Um...

53
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,099
Mayor Anderson wants me
to keep track of the refugees.

54
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:03,159
You know,

55
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,968
find out where they end up.

56
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:07,448
See what kind of work
they're doing to help the town.

57
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:08,870
Sarah Mason.

58
00:03:09,111 --> 00:03:10,853
She's been...
staying with you, right?

59
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:16,804
Mr. Hawkins...

60
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:20,343
It's freezing out here. Uh...

61
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,796
Is she around?

62
00:03:25,235 --> 00:03:27,621
- Oh, the generator's back on.
- Thank God.

63
00:03:29,046 --> 00:03:30,157
Well, that's it.

64
00:03:30,198 --> 00:03:31,525
We're on our last tank of diesel.

65
00:03:31,526 --> 00:03:33,375
Power's out to everything
but the medical center.

66
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:35,673
Our last tank?
How long will we have power?

67
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,039
Ten, maybe 12 hours,

68
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,808
so turn off anything
you're not using.

69
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,255
What about the biodiesel?

70
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:41,408
We burned through it.

71
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:42,735
We're not going
to have any more for days.

72
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:44,277
We need to come up
with another plan.

73
00:03:44,278 --> 00:03:46,467
We're getting more and
more people in here every...

74
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,371
Oh, God!

75
00:03:50,214 --> 00:03:51,219
April, can you hear me?

76
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,975
Is she breathing?
April, wake up!

77
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,790
Get over here!

00:04:12,472 --> 00:04:14,160
It's colder than a witch's patootie.

83
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,507
Using candles.

84
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:25,648
I saw you had some electric lights on
when I was walking up.

85
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:31,438
I got a geni
in the basement, but, uh...

86
00:04:31,894 --> 00:04:33,998
I just used the last of my gas.

87
00:04:34,995 --> 00:04:36,241
What were you doing?

88
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,866
I'm putting some stuff
in storage, but, uh...

89
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,437
I was just cleaning up.

90
00:04:45,113 --> 00:04:47,285
Using the last of your fuel
on housework, huh?

91
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:48,652
Darcy's trained you well.

92
00:04:50,528 --> 00:04:51,748
Listen, Jimmy, um...

93
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,678
I was just about to turn in, so...

94
00:04:53,946 --> 00:04:55,253
Right. Sorry.

95
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:57,184
Uh, well, like I said,

96
00:04:57,185 --> 00:04:59,999
Mayor Anderson's got me keeping
tabs on the refugees, you know.

97
00:05:00,388 --> 00:05:01,540
Crime's up.

98
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,567
So, Sarah Mason.

99
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,795
Is she here?
Can I ask her some questions?

100
00:05:06,796 --> 00:05:07,961
You know, um...

101
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,117
Sarah left yesterday.

102
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:14,596
Something about, uh...

103
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:16,312
family in New Orleans.

104
00:05:19,074 --> 00:05:20,615
Wow. In this weather?

105
00:05:23,778 --> 00:05:24,998
Well, I'm sorry to bother you.

106
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:26,459
Hey, don't worry about it.

107
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:30,922
You know, that's a...

108
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:33,107
nasty- looking cut
you got there.

109
00:05:33,808 --> 00:05:36,167
Uh, yeah, it was, uh...

110
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,271
tree branch when
I was cutting wood.

111
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:43,220
- Must have been a real bleeder.
- Hey, it's not too deep.

112
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:46,503
Well, you be careful.

113
00:05:46,642 --> 00:05:48,103
It's dangerous out there.

114
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:50,529
Again, sorry to bother you.

115
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,615
Yes.

116
00:05:56,178 --> 00:05:57,800
I don't feel good.

117
00:05:57,939 --> 00:05:59,695
I'm so tired all of a sudden.

118
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,075
I know.

119
00:06:01,522 --> 00:06:03,559
I told you you need
to get some rest.

120
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:05,338
Here's your big chance.

121
00:06:07,643 --> 00:06:10,137
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you, honey.

122
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:15,109
I'm trying to keep her calm,

123
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,937
but my gut tells me
the baby's having a problem,

124
00:06:17,938 --> 00:06:19,873
and if I know it, she knows it.

125
00:06:19,874 --> 00:06:21,897
- What are we going to do?
- Get Kenchy?

126
00:06:22,023 --> 00:06:23,578
There's another doctor in town?

127
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:25,607
The man can barely
sit up on his bar stool.

128
00:06:25,608 --> 00:06:27,993
Look, what I really need is
an ultrasound machine.

129
00:06:27,994 --> 00:06:30,620
Without it, there's no real way
to know what's going on.

130
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:33,849
Well, maybe we have one that
survived the EMP in the basement.

131
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,458
- I'll go look.
- Good.

132
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:38,072
You go get your father
and tell him to find Eric.

133
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:39,814
He's the one who should be here.

134
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,876
It's the guys from New Bern.

135
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:52,547
They actually built the thing.
I can't believe it.

136
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:54,104
Hey, Russell.

137
00:06:54,572 --> 00:06:57,151
- Hey. Sheriff, good to see you.
- Good to see you.

138
00:06:57,402 --> 00:06:59,194
Johnston, you SOB.

139
00:06:59,195 --> 00:07:01,699
- How the hell did you lose an election?
- No, the question is,

140
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,548
how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?

141
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,245
They get tired of you
being the sheriff?

142
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:06,501
No, I'm still sheriff.

143
00:07:06,601 --> 00:07:07,957
Just got a little more authority.

144
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:11,439
Well, this is our new mayor.

145
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,762
This is Gray Anderson.

146
00:07:13,064 --> 00:07:15,039
- Mayor Anderson.
- Nice to meet you.

147
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:16,803
Congratulations.

148
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:19,520
Thank you. Thank you.
So, this is the windmill, huh?

149
00:07:19,622 --> 00:07:21,714
It's a power-generating wind turbine.

150
00:07:21,715 --> 00:07:24,159
We get about 1,500 watts an hour
out of one of these.

151
00:07:26,776 --> 00:07:28,752
- Have you seen Eric?
- No, did you try Mary's?

152
00:07:28,753 --> 00:07:30,929
Yeah. I tried there.
I tried at Bailey's.

153
00:07:31,381 --> 00:07:33,608
Does this thing work?
Can we get power from it?

154
00:07:33,609 --> 00:07:34,964
Probably some time tomorrow.

155
00:07:34,965 --> 00:07:36,370
Let's get it up as fast as we can.

156
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:38,268
I think we're going to need it
at the medical center.

157
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:40,102
- You got it.
- There's something wrong with April.

158
00:07:40,103 --> 00:07:41,120
What? What is it?

159
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:43,815
She passed out. They think
there's a problem with the baby.

160
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:50,796
I'll pick you up at 5:00.

161
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,101
I'll walk.

162
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:56,392
Stanley thinks that you're using
this whole volunteering thing

163
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,167
as an excuse
to see Sean Henthorn.

164
00:07:58,168 --> 00:08:00,160
I'm just following orders
to keep an eye on you.

165
00:08:00,161 --> 00:08:02,369
Personally, I don't give
a damn who you date.

166
00:08:03,173 --> 00:08:06,019
I've been volunteering here
since I was 16.

167
00:08:06,427 --> 00:08:08,101
It's not about Sean.

168
00:08:12,053 --> 00:08:14,564
You volunteer for anything? Ever?

169
00:08:23,973 --> 00:08:25,429
Mr. Fredrickson.

170
00:08:25,697 --> 00:08:27,086
Come on, stop.

171
00:08:27,393 --> 00:08:30,474
Gracie gave you beet seed
in exchange for 3% of your farm crop.

172
00:08:30,513 --> 00:08:32,924
That 3% is mine now.
The store was left to me.

173
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,547
I can't do that, Dale.

174
00:08:34,832 --> 00:08:36,021
Things have gotten worse now.

175
00:08:36,022 --> 00:08:38,465
I need it for my family,
to feed the last of my livestock.

176
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:39,536
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,763
It's the law, Mr. Fredrickson.
It's rightfully mine.

178
00:08:41,764 --> 00:08:43,504
There are no more laws, son.

179
00:08:52,304 --> 00:08:53,710
No.

180
00:08:57,845 --> 00:08:59,051
I volunteered.

181
00:08:59,921 --> 00:09:01,361
So. What do I do?

182
00:09:06,735 --> 00:09:08,577
Empty. Clean. Repeat.

183
00:09:10,836 --> 00:09:11,991
Where the hell is Eric?

184
00:09:12,158 --> 00:09:14,703
Nobody knows.
Dad's getting Bill on it.

185
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:16,527
Her blood pressure's dropping.

186
00:09:23,712 --> 00:09:26,240
- I'm feeling contractions.
- I think she's going into labor.

187
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:27,679
No, no, I can't.

188
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:29,454
The baby's only 16 weeks.

189
00:09:30,207 --> 00:09:32,635
I need, I need ritodrine
to stop the labor.

190
00:09:32,636 --> 00:09:34,113
I already checked.
We don't have any more.

191
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:35,653
I'll try to find some nifedipine.

192
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:37,344
All right, now what are you feeling?

193
00:09:37,345 --> 00:09:39,721
If I lose consciousness,
and you can't find any medicine,

194
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:41,228
use alcohol.

195
00:09:41,229 --> 00:09:42,985
What do you mean?
What kind of alcohol?

196
00:09:43,186 --> 00:09:45,061
Anything coming out of the still.

197
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,471
Give me a 10% drip.

198
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:50,406
It'll stop the contractions.

199
00:09:53,368 --> 00:09:55,562
Oh, God, she's bleeding.

200
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:57,285
Get Kenchy. Now!

201
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:03,626
I'm so cold my mouth is numb.

202
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:08,409
We need the logs or we're
going to freeze to death.

203
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,552
Isn't that what we're doing now?

204
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:14,191
All right. Let's get in the car.

205
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:26,093
Blanket.

206
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:27,533
Let's turn on the heat.

207
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:29,868
We can't. I'm sorry.

208
00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:31,417
We won't have enough gas to get home.

209
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,647
You know, we could make our own heat.

210
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:43,124
Don't get any ideas...

211
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,930
I'm not taking my clothes off.

212
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,951
You know how happy you make me.

213
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:55,305
I'm still not taking my clothes off.

214
00:11:01,198 --> 00:11:02,243
Come on!

215
00:11:05,043 --> 00:11:06,102
What's her pressure?

216
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,444
- You smell like a wino.
- Nice to meet you too.

217
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:10,966
- What's her pressure, please ?
- 80/44 and dropping.

218
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:12,657
- Is she dilated?
- Two centimeters.

219
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:14,516
Her contractions are six minutes apart.

220
00:11:15,431 --> 00:11:16,434
I need an ultrasound.

221
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:17,845
I brought some old ones
up from the basement.

222
00:11:17,846 --> 00:11:19,057
I'll go check on them now.

223
00:11:20,606 --> 00:11:22,128
- Do we have fresh plasma?
- No.

224
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,633
I need you to find somebody...

225
00:11:23,634 --> 00:11:25,027
- With O-negative blood.
- Yes.

226
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:27,840
And we need
a fetal heart monitor.

227
00:11:27,943 --> 00:11:29,388
Do we have that?
No?

228
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,916
I need you to put these on
and monitor the baby's heart rate.

229
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:34,101
Here, put these in your ear.

230
00:11:34,102 --> 00:11:35,236
I'll show you how to listen.

231
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,248
I'm deaf.

232
00:11:41,088 --> 00:11:42,121
Madam?

233
00:11:42,482 --> 00:11:43,592
I need you to put these in ears.

234
00:11:43,593 --> 00:11:44,985
I need you to monitor
the baby's heart rate.

235
00:11:44,986 --> 00:11:46,972
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. I will show you how.

236
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:49,063
Come on, let's go! Please!

237
00:11:50,596 --> 00:11:51,783
Here we go. Put these on.

238
00:11:51,784 --> 00:11:53,022
Listen right here.

239
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,222
Now, the higher one,
the fast one.

240
00:11:56,223 --> 00:11:57,383
You hear that?

241
00:11:57,476 --> 00:11:58,648
That's the baby's heart rate.

242
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:00,300
You count 15 seconds,

243
00:12:00,301 --> 00:12:02,903
and then you multiply
that by four.

244
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,942
- To get the beats per minute.
- Perfect

245
00:12:05,252 --> 00:12:07,729
now I will show you
how to take blood pressure

246
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,785
and pulse rate.

247
00:12:12,218 --> 00:12:14,024
All right, let's get ready to lift it.

248
00:12:14,153 --> 00:12:16,166
You want me to settle
a contract dispute?!

249
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:18,385
Mr. Fredrickson isn't giving
Dale his share.

250
00:12:19,024 --> 00:12:20,288
You're kidding me, right?

251
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,914
I'm trying to get power restored.

252
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:23,846
I got home robberies all over town.

253
00:12:23,863 --> 00:12:26,262
The refugees are threatening
to break into the food lockup.

254
00:12:26,263 --> 00:12:27,875
Okay, we're going to go on three.

255
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:28,985
One...

256
00:12:29,217 --> 00:12:30,275
two...

257
00:12:30,477 --> 00:12:31,482
three.

258
00:12:33,496 --> 00:12:34,503
There we go.

259
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,774
A little higher, a little higher.

260
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,348
Okay, easy

261
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,423
Got it.

262
00:12:41,781 --> 00:12:42,968
Watch the rope.

263
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:45,084
There you go.

264
00:12:46,117 --> 00:12:47,252
Keep it going.

265
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:48,543
Almost there.

266
00:12:48,672 --> 00:12:49,988
You got enough on your side?

267
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:51,433
Keep it taut.

268
00:12:51,816 --> 00:12:53,158
Good job, fellas.

269
00:12:58,664 --> 00:12:59,676
How's the baby?

270
00:12:59,677 --> 00:13:01,268
I don't know.
How close is this?

271
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,050
I don't know, hours, at least.
Did you find Eric?

272
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:05,810
No. Bill and the rangers
are out looking for him.

273
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:16,589
Can we buy some more of these things?

274
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:19,647
Yeah. Let's talk about it.

275
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:29,094
<i>Mr. Hawkins!</i>

276
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,133
<i>I'm back!</i>

277
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:34,746
<i>Mr. Hawkins, you around?</i>

278
00:13:38,075 --> 00:13:39,443
Just a second!

279
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:54,927
You weren't answering
your front door, so I just...

280
00:13:56,888 --> 00:13:58,694
You doing some yard work?
You need a hand?

281
00:13:58,695 --> 00:14:00,707
No. No, thank you.

282
00:14:01,518 --> 00:14:02,844
I was going to turn some compost.

283
00:14:02,845 --> 00:14:04,703
Getting ready to plant
food for the spring.

284
00:14:05,813 --> 00:14:07,000
That's a good idea.

285
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:08,910
Margaret's planting carrots inside.

286
00:14:09,865 --> 00:14:11,645
They're a super-food,
you know...

287
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:13,102
like broccoli.

288
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,413
You need something, Jimmy?

289
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,620
Gray wants me to find out
what kind of resources

290
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:20,325
Sarah might've taken with her, you know?

291
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:22,343
Fuel, food. Did she...

292
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,894
drive out of town?
- She didn't drive.

293
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,522
Took a backpack.

294
00:14:28,098 --> 00:14:29,931
Some food...
a tent.

295
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,931
Then just walked out into the cold, huh?

296
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:35,983
That's crazy.

297
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,723
Maybe Darcy knows something more.

298
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:39,802
No, I don't think so.

299
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:41,320
I just figured,

300
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:44,527
you know, women talk, and who knows
what the hell they say, right?

301
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:50,543
Is Darcy around?
Can I...

302
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:51,764
can I speak with her?

303
00:14:56,918 --> 00:14:58,874
Darcy and I are having problems.

304
00:14:59,891 --> 00:15:01,017
She's moved out.

305
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,162
Boy, that's tough.

306
00:15:05,377 --> 00:15:07,380
A lot of people leaving you lately, huh?

307
00:15:08,944 --> 00:15:10,180
I'm-I'm sorry.

308
00:15:10,352 --> 00:15:11,870
That's insensitive. I...

309
00:15:13,138 --> 00:15:14,738
I will get my coat.

310
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,402
I'll take you to her, Jimmy.

311
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:19,569
Really?

312
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:33,383
<i>Hey, how are your, uh,
communication skills?</i>

313
00:15:34,591 --> 00:15:37,197
You know, 'cause that's really
what marriage is all about.

314
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,991
<i>Honesty, love.</i>

315
00:15:41,946 --> 00:15:43,752
<i>I'd say it's 50-50.</i>

316
00:15:44,063 --> 00:15:46,075
<i>Sort of like half and half, you know?</i>

317
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:51,211
Well, actually, more like thirds,
if you throw respect in there.

318
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,134
<i>But not equal thirds, 'cause honesty...</i>

319
00:15:53,882 --> 00:15:56,592
<i>is more important than
the love and the respect.</i>

320
00:15:58,437 --> 00:15:59,446
<i>I think.</i>

321
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:02,204
You got one of the only
salt mines around for 400 miles.

322
00:16:02,774 --> 00:16:05,200
A year without salt, and New Bern
will be a ghost town.

323
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,929
What are we talking about,
a couple hundred pounds?

324
00:16:07,058 --> 00:16:08,787
No, we need a lot more than that.

325
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:11,329
- We're going to need food.
- No food to spare.

326
00:16:11,343 --> 00:16:12,891
Won't see another crop till spring.

327
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,775
Spring crop's what I'm talking about.

328
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,395
Ten wind turbines for,
let's say...

329
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:18,814
ten percent of your spring crop.

330
00:16:18,815 --> 00:16:20,233
No, we can't put ourselves
in that position.

331
00:16:20,285 --> 00:16:22,272
Spring crop might not even
get us to next year.

332
00:16:22,422 --> 00:16:25,272
If we lose ten percent, we'll just be
in the same position we are now.

333
00:16:25,273 --> 00:16:26,279
Worse.

334
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:28,443
Look, all we're asking you
to do is be reasonable.

335
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,069
Well, we're just trying to survive.

336
00:16:34,095 --> 00:16:36,520
Starve next fall or freeze
this winter...

337
00:16:36,724 --> 00:16:37,989
take your pick.

338
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,444
Vancomycin... good.

339
00:16:58,496 --> 00:17:00,406
Start a drip: 250 milligrams IV.

340
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:03,051
I'll do it.

341
00:17:03,128 --> 00:17:05,012
We found four people who are O-negative.

342
00:17:05,554 --> 00:17:07,709
- Fetal heart rate is 169.
- I'll get it off the ultrasound.

343
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,670
Her blood pressure is 130/70.

344
00:17:09,671 --> 00:17:12,715
Her respiratory rate is 18,
and her pulse is 88, it's going up.

345
00:17:12,716 --> 00:17:13,721
She's losing blood.

346
00:17:13,722 --> 00:17:15,709
Her heart's compensating
by pumping harder.

347
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,231
Start an IV for the blood.

348
00:17:23,657 --> 00:17:25,077
What do you see?

349
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:29,025
- Placenta previa.
- What's that?

350
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:31,038
The placenta is covering
the entire cervix.

351
00:17:31,222 --> 00:17:33,066
There's no way for me to find out
where the bleed is coming from

352
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:34,340
unless we operate.

353
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,507
Well, what are we going to do?

354
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:38,758
Under the best of circumstances,
this is not an operating facility.

355
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,406
- Then we don't have a choice.
- Cannot operate here.

356
00:17:41,454 --> 00:17:42,468
Why?

357
00:17:43,751 --> 00:17:46,332
I have been through this more times
than you could possibly imagine.

358
00:17:46,347 --> 00:17:48,153
We've all been through a lot, all right?
Just tell us...

359
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,605
I have seen
hundreds of people die

360
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:52,437
because of dirty facilities
and infection

361
00:17:52,463 --> 00:17:54,321
and because I didn't have
the proper medicine

362
00:17:54,347 --> 00:17:55,633
or the equipment
that I needed.

363
00:17:55,637 --> 00:17:56,902
I am not doing it again.

364
00:17:56,979 --> 00:17:58,759
We are not losing this baby.

365
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:01,598
You can find yourself another butcher.

366
00:18:05,213 --> 00:18:06,503
There's got to be a way.

367
00:18:09,034 --> 00:18:10,944
Kenchy. Listen,

368
00:18:11,202 --> 00:18:13,163
we need a sterile operating room,

369
00:18:13,628 --> 00:18:15,099
sterile instruments,

370
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,589
anesthesia, spinal block tray,
caesarian tray.

371
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:19,911
Have you ever even seen a surgery
performed without

372
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:20,941
an electrocautery machine?

373
00:18:20,948 --> 00:18:22,852
No, you haven't. Because
this doesn't even taught anymore.

374
00:18:22,877 --> 00:18:25,690
Can't we just use laparotomy
sponges to stop the bleeding?

375
00:18:26,232 --> 00:18:27,781
God, my head is killing me.

376
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:30,077
We've got several spinal block trays,

377
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:31,419
and we've got anesthesia.

378
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:33,987
And we can boil
the sheets and the tools.

379
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,671
Is it possible?

380
00:18:39,477 --> 00:18:41,748
- Remotely.
- Then start.

381
00:18:43,012 --> 00:18:45,232
- We need bleach.
- What?

382
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,645
Bleach.
You know? Bleach.

383
00:18:50,068 --> 00:18:52,598
Bonnie, look at my lips.
Bleach !

384
00:18:53,475 --> 00:18:54,636
Learn.

385
00:18:57,656 --> 00:18:59,952
Is that the word for "bleach"?
No.

386
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:01,014
"Bitch."

387
00:19:01,582 --> 00:19:04,266
And... "please."

388
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:08,169
And "sorry."

389
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:37,710
I'm heading out.

390
00:19:38,986 --> 00:19:40,922
If I'm not back, lock up at dark

391
00:19:41,102 --> 00:19:42,754
and don't let anyone in.

392
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,186
Also, if I'm not around ever

393
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:49,360
and you need anything,
just talk to Gail Green or Johnston.

394
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:50,901
You can trust them.

395
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,443
I'm going to come with you.

396
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,217
Why?

397
00:20:01,171 --> 00:20:02,925
Two against one.

398
00:20:14,622 --> 00:20:15,784
Hey, Bill.

399
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,217
What's wrong?

400
00:20:21,965 --> 00:20:23,864
I just jumped in.

401
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:26,040
It was...

402
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:30,464
It was just in the moment.

403
00:20:30,602 --> 00:20:33,826
You volunteered at the medical center
long before I ever get here.

404
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:35,517
It's fine.

405
00:20:36,383 --> 00:20:38,267
Kenchy just doesn't know you.

406
00:20:38,601 --> 00:20:40,737
Everybody else respects you.

407
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:43,961
They speak your language.

408
00:20:51,487 --> 00:20:53,873
- Hey, we got a problem.
- What's that?

409
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:57,311
Eddie and Frank are asking
how come you're not making the deal.

410
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:59,544
Words are gonna start to spread.

411
00:20:59,715 --> 00:21:01,199
As far as they know,
the marines said that

412
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,560
the army corp of engineers would
be here within the month.

413
00:21:03,624 --> 00:21:06,192
What difference does it make if we give
New Bern a part of next year's profit?

414
00:21:06,193 --> 00:21:07,870
They think there's going
to be food by then.

415
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:10,437
You didn't want to tell them it was
a bunch of crap, so now what do we do?

416
00:21:10,438 --> 00:21:11,805
All right,

417
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:14,650
maybe we should tell the town
that help's not coming.

418
00:21:14,836 --> 00:21:17,572
We just told them that to give 'em
something to get through winter.

419
00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:19,678
Town's already on the edge,
you'll have anarchy.

420
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,396
And I'm not leverage
next winter's food,

421
00:21:21,397 --> 00:21:22,554
that'd be suicide.

422
00:21:25,247 --> 00:21:26,432
What if we tell New Bern that

423
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:28,429
we'll give them
10% of next year's crop.

424
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,089
We get power now.

425
00:21:30,787 --> 00:21:33,590
If next year we don't have
the food to give, we don't give it up.

426
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:37,221
That's how wars get started.

427
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,381
I can't believe Darcy is staying
at the refugee shelter.

428
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:46,475
Hey, Jim,

429
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,387
let me talk to her a second.

430
00:21:49,238 --> 00:21:50,927
- Sure.
- Thanks.

431
00:21:57,772 --> 00:21:59,879
I asked you to stay away.

432
00:22:00,135 --> 00:22:02,200
Jimmy wanted to ask you
some questions...

433
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,214
about Sarah.

434
00:22:07,772 --> 00:22:09,153
Where are the kids?

435
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:11,386
They're in the gym, playing.

436
00:22:12,335 --> 00:22:14,554
We need a consistent cover story.

437
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:19,397
What'd you do with her body?

438
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:24,784
I buried her.

439
00:22:26,626 --> 00:22:28,510
So I can tell them that right now,

440
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:29,924
and never see you again.

441
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,432
I could tell him about...

442
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,635
- What did you call it... "the package"?
- Stop it!

443
00:22:37,261 --> 00:22:38,713
You understand the story?

444
00:22:39,081 --> 00:22:40,826
Family? New Orleans?

445
00:22:41,203 --> 00:22:43,422
And you don't know
anything else about her.

446
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:47,899
This'll just take a sec.

447
00:22:48,318 --> 00:22:50,635
Yeah, well, I don't want
to talk to you in front of him.

448
00:22:53,314 --> 00:22:55,449
Why don't you give us
a minute, Mr. Hawkins?

449
00:22:58,352 --> 00:22:59,595
I'll be out front...

450
00:23:00,516 --> 00:23:01,897
let you two talk.

451
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,976
You're going to be okay, angel.

452
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:18,363
Did you ever do
a surgical rotation?

453
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:19,498
Only in school.

454
00:23:19,547 --> 00:23:21,222
Most of my career was in post-op.

455
00:23:22,841 --> 00:23:25,730
I feel obligated to ask you
if you're sober enough to do this.

456
00:23:25,744 --> 00:23:27,349
You can talk me through it.

457
00:23:27,837 --> 00:23:29,973
You will refer to me
as Dr. Dhuwalia, Nurse.

458
00:23:29,974 --> 00:23:31,793
And my sobriety is not the issue.

459
00:23:31,794 --> 00:23:34,905
The people I call "doctor"
don't smell like a brewery.

460
00:23:34,906 --> 00:23:37,432
Respirations are 16.
Pulse rate is 82.

461
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:39,544
Her blood pressure's down to 100/62.

462
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:41,094
God help us.

463
00:23:46,138 --> 00:23:47,868
- Is the baby okay?
- I don't know.

464
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,780
Mom said there's a problem.

465
00:23:49,877 --> 00:23:51,677
We were just
collecting firewood.

466
00:23:51,678 --> 00:23:53,217
You don't have
to explain it to me.

467
00:23:53,357 --> 00:23:54,543
What about Mom?

468
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:56,334
Don't worry about that.

469
00:24:07,961 --> 00:24:09,259
Shut the door.

470
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:15,707
We're losing too much blood.
Clamp it off.

471
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:21,877
Get away from the incision!

472
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,705
I need to hear
if the baby's in distress.

473
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,292
Get away from the incision.

474
00:24:26,293 --> 00:24:29,041
You haven't let me get
a pulse from this baby in an hour.

475
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:31,353
Respirations are 16, pulse is 84.

476
00:24:32,077 --> 00:24:34,463
Fetal heart rate is less than
five beats per minute.

477
00:24:34,464 --> 00:24:36,924
You're not close enough to the fetus.
It's not an accurate measurement.

478
00:24:36,925 --> 00:24:39,563
The placenta's grown into
the uterus wall. It's ripping away.

479
00:24:39,731 --> 00:24:41,671
- That's what's causing the bleeding.
- Now I've lost it.

480
00:24:41,672 --> 00:24:43,480
- I can't hear anything.
- What is going on?

481
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:44,987
The baby's heart beat has stopped.

482
00:24:44,988 --> 00:24:47,058
- What do you mean, it's stopped?
- Do something.

483
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,301
That must be
the last of the diesel.

484
00:24:51,302 --> 00:24:52,474
Open the door.

485
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:54,274
Open the blinds.
I need light.

486
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:56,944
Why aren't you doing
something about the baby?

487
00:24:58,345 --> 00:25:00,480
This hasn't been about
the baby for several hours.

488
00:25:00,481 --> 00:25:02,252
The baby never really had a chance.

489
00:25:02,253 --> 00:25:04,248
- I'm sorry.
- What are you saying?

490
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:08,846
I am trying to save April.

491
00:25:22,175 --> 00:25:24,241
- What do you want?
- Same thing as before.

492
00:25:24,573 --> 00:25:27,927
- My share of the crop.
- I told you I can't do that. Go home.

493
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,664
I'm only asking for what's mine.

494
00:25:37,488 --> 00:25:39,037
You said there's no law, right?

495
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,074
I'm not trying to cheat anybody.

496
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:42,903
I don't have that much left.

497
00:25:42,904 --> 00:25:44,856
Then give my share
of whatever you got.

498
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:46,544
Right now.

499
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:01,572
- What's going on?
- I... I just...

500
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,959
need some space right now.

501
00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:10,064
We lost the baby.

502
00:26:14,684 --> 00:26:15,884
Oh, sweetie...

503
00:26:19,862 --> 00:26:21,537
I need to be
with April right now.

504
00:26:48,903 --> 00:26:50,257
What took you so long?

505
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,983
Well after...
talking with Darcy, uh...

506
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,817
a lot of things are starting
to make sense now.

507
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:01,780
You all right, Mr. Hawkins?

508
00:27:03,134 --> 00:27:04,404
I'm fine.

509
00:27:07,154 --> 00:27:08,493
Well, Darcy said...

510
00:27:10,224 --> 00:27:13,085
that Sarah left for New Orleans,
just like you told me.

511
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:17,091
What? You think I was lying?

512
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,805
I told Darcy she and the kids
can come stay with us.

513
00:27:20,885 --> 00:27:23,081
She doesn't need
to be staying in the shelter.

514
00:27:23,635 --> 00:27:25,362
Thanks, Jimmy.
I appreciate that.

515
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,340
We found a body, Robert.

516
00:27:38,576 --> 00:27:39,822
Out in the woods.

517
00:27:42,688 --> 00:27:45,192
Near Mill Creek.
Broken neck.

518
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:46,813
Animals got to it.

519
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,449
Michael Connor was on patrol,

520
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,923
said he saw
an African-American woman

521
00:27:50,924 --> 00:27:53,159
driving out that way
a couple nights ago.

522
00:27:54,136 --> 00:27:55,958
Perfect description of Sarah Mason.

523
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:57,939
Really?

524
00:28:00,562 --> 00:28:02,236
Think she could do
something like that?

525
00:28:03,523 --> 00:28:04,621
I don't know.

526
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,767
You know,
I'm learning that, uh...

527
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:10,794
it's hard to figure what
people are capable of, Jimmy.

528
00:28:12,027 --> 00:28:13,741
Well, our John Doe was bald.

529
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:16,018
Know anyone looks like that?

530
00:28:26,503 --> 00:28:28,017
If Sarah comes back...

531
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,601
we'd really, really
like to talk to her.

532
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,989
My guess is...

533
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:35,060
she's not coming back.

534
00:28:37,886 --> 00:28:39,573
That'd be my guess, too.

535
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,117
New Bern's all made of clay,
can't grow nothing.

536
00:28:48,867 --> 00:28:50,970
We need 10% of your spring crop,

537
00:28:51,095 --> 00:28:52,983
and 700 pounds refined salt.

538
00:28:52,984 --> 00:28:55,075
Well, y-you said 500 earlier.

539
00:28:55,076 --> 00:28:57,097
- Price went up.
- Why?

540
00:28:57,512 --> 00:28:59,668
Because that's what
power costs in this world.

541
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:00,887
Oh, now, come on...

542
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:03,327
We got people freezing
to death in their homes.

543
00:29:03,328 --> 00:29:04,360
Give us a break.

544
00:29:06,063 --> 00:29:07,702
You were at my son's wedding.

545
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:10,626
I'm sorry for your troubles.

546
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:12,643
But we got our own.

547
00:29:23,771 --> 00:29:25,778
We'll give you the food.
We'll give you the salt.

548
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:27,677
Everything.

549
00:29:29,028 --> 00:29:31,379
We can have the wind turbines
to you in a couple weeks.

550
00:29:31,844 --> 00:29:33,968
What guarantee do we have
you'll give us our share of the crop?

551
00:29:33,969 --> 00:29:35,250
You have our word.

552
00:29:36,623 --> 00:29:39,144
We're going to need ten Jericho men
to help us build them.

553
00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:41,160
We can take them
back with us now.

554
00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:44,428
Is this about manpower
for wind turbines?

555
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:47,668
Or is it more about making sure
you get our crops come spring?

556
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:49,304
Human beings as collateral?

557
00:29:49,504 --> 00:29:50,952
I would never do that.

558
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,886
But I am not going
to build these things on credit.

559
00:29:53,887 --> 00:29:56,155
You want them now?
You're going to help make them.

560
00:29:58,701 --> 00:29:59,841
Just hold the pressure.

561
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:01,919
Put pressure right there.
Right there.

562
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,279
Press, harder!

563
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,156
Damn it! I can't see!

564
00:30:05,157 --> 00:30:06,610
I- I'll get another lantern.

565
00:30:06,793 --> 00:30:09,094
You can bring ten lanterns.
Doesn't make any difference.

566
00:30:09,095 --> 00:30:11,064
It's not going to be enough.
I need real light!

567
00:30:11,065 --> 00:30:13,485
Blood pressure is down to 66/30.

568
00:30:13,486 --> 00:30:14,582
This is crazy.

569
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:16,780
This is crazy. Close her up.

570
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,496
But we haven't stopped
the bleeding.

571
00:30:18,497 --> 00:30:21,096
- What are you doing?
- Give her some peace.

572
00:30:21,498 --> 00:30:22,811
Give her some dignity.

573
00:30:22,812 --> 00:30:24,934
You are not giving up on her.

574
00:30:24,935 --> 00:30:25,959
I'm sorry.

575
00:30:27,031 --> 00:30:28,077
Close this up.

576
00:30:38,194 --> 00:30:39,574
Where do you think you're going?

577
00:30:39,575 --> 00:30:40,888
You get back inside, right now!

578
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:43,378
- Come on!
- Take it easy.

579
00:30:43,512 --> 00:30:44,852
Take it easy, all right?

580
00:30:45,228 --> 00:30:46,595
Just let me handle this.

581
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:47,761
Let me handle it.

582
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,267
What are you doing?

583
00:30:50,938 --> 00:30:52,559
You want me to say it
in front of him?

584
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,611
Go back inside, all right?

585
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,018
April needs you.

586
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:04,101
To go on operating
is cruel and pointless.

587
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,054
Don't even ask me, Jake.
I'm done with this.

588
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:09,259
I became a plastic surgeon

589
00:31:09,353 --> 00:31:11,377
so I could have the simple, easy life
that other man face.

590
00:31:11,378 --> 00:31:13,191
- Not in this town.
- I don't care.

591
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,981
I'm not going through this anymore.
It is madness.

592
00:31:15,982 --> 00:31:17,884
And everyone here
can just go to hell?

593
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,459
If you stop trying, and I stop,
then they see that.

594
00:31:22,726 --> 00:31:24,509
And this whole thing falls apart.

595
00:31:24,811 --> 00:31:27,463
We're all leaning on each other here,
whether you like it or not.

596
00:31:27,464 --> 00:31:28,465
Promise me

597
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:30,015
you are not saying
that we're all connected.

598
00:31:30,016 --> 00:31:32,481
This is not some existential,
web-of-life BS.

599
00:31:32,482 --> 00:31:34,599
That is not what I'm hearing,
is it, Jake?

600
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:37,400
Then tell me
what you want to hear.

601
00:31:39,451 --> 00:31:40,845
'Cause I'll say anything,

602
00:31:41,163 --> 00:31:43,978
if you'll just go back in there
and keep trying.

603
00:31:49,687 --> 00:31:51,242
She's going to die.

604
00:31:57,287 --> 00:31:58,467
I know.

605
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,465
Okay. New gloves.

606
00:32:20,092 --> 00:32:22,225
Let's get this bleeding
stopped, shall we?

607
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,373
- Well, we've got more sponges.
- Excellent!

608
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,315
Pack them in others vascular bleeding.

609
00:32:27,402 --> 00:32:28,994
Just give me time to suture.

610
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:01,974
He's going to need you.

611
00:33:05,612 --> 00:33:06,636
Now.

612
00:33:24,447 --> 00:33:25,719
Hold my hand.

613
00:33:30,371 --> 00:33:31,492
I'm right here.

614
00:33:33,728 --> 00:33:35,190
I'm right next to you.

615
00:33:46,347 --> 00:33:48,151
I like the name Tracy.

616
00:33:57,655 --> 00:33:59,553
Tracy's a beautiful name.

617
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,736
Thank you for not saying anything.

618
00:35:21,888 --> 00:35:24,053
I didn't do it for you,
I did it for Allison.

619
00:35:30,052 --> 00:35:32,027
I need my family to come home.

620
00:35:33,963 --> 00:35:35,160
I, uh...

621
00:35:36,963 --> 00:35:38,197
I need you.

622
00:35:42,618 --> 00:35:43,985
You know, in the last

623
00:35:44,592 --> 00:35:46,776
three months,
I remembered all the reasons

624
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:48,884
why I need you in my life.

625
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:49,968
So have I.

626
00:35:49,998 --> 00:35:52,086
I've also remembered
why it can never work.

627
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:57,801
I need truth, Robert, and that's
something you've never given me.

628
00:35:57,873 --> 00:36:01,329
- Everything I do, I do for us.
- Listen.

629
00:36:02,563 --> 00:36:05,506
When you hide a part of yourself,

630
00:36:05,734 --> 00:36:07,576
I don't care what the reason is...

631
00:36:08,406 --> 00:36:10,172
it puts something between us.

632
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:12,508
Please.

633
00:36:13,495 --> 00:36:15,527
My daughter just killed a woman.

634
00:36:17,573 --> 00:36:19,833
I don't have any more trust to give you.

635
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:27,462
So, I got the kids with
Margaret back at the house.

636
00:36:28,506 --> 00:36:29,892
What can I carry?

637
00:36:30,129 --> 00:36:31,155
This.

638
00:36:40,624 --> 00:36:41,839
Hang in there.

639
00:36:42,902 --> 00:36:44,440
I got faith in you guys.

640
00:37:00,152 --> 00:37:01,272
Sorry?

641
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,980
The wind turbine's working.

642
00:37:22,461 --> 00:37:24,188
Mrs. Hodges, how are you doing?

643
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:27,037
- Not so hot.
- Let's get you checked out again.

644
00:37:27,606 --> 00:37:28,897
Dr. Dhuwalia.

645
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:36,052
Mrs. Hodges' cough is worse.
Her temperature is 102.

646
00:37:42,754 --> 00:37:45,659
- Hello, Mrs. Hodges.
- I'm Dr. Dhuwalia.

647
00:37:45,735 --> 00:37:47,919
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

648
00:37:48,504 --> 00:37:52,605
Why don't you go outside
and get a pan of boiling hot water

649
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,257
build a tent with a sheet. We need to
get this lady breathing some moist air.

650
00:37:58,702 --> 00:38:01,171
Take a deep breath.
There we go.

651
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,082
That was incredible!
Did you see the look on his face?

652
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,000
I know, I thought he
was going to have a heart attack,

653
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:09,073
and we were going to have
to drive him to the medical center.

654
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,327
I think we're going to be okay.

655
00:38:18,601 --> 00:38:19,835
Thanks for coming.

656
00:38:21,487 --> 00:38:23,025
I wanted to be there...

657
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,044
with you.

658
00:38:34,627 --> 00:38:37,285
<i>You men are the only ones
who really know what's going on here.</i>

659
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:41,134
When New Bern gets
their share of the spring crop,

660
00:38:41,269 --> 00:38:45,028
you'll be allowed to return.
I know that sounds like a long time,

661
00:38:45,883 --> 00:38:50,065
but what you are about to do
means this town's survival.

662
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,791
Now you've...

663
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:56,812
I know your families want some time
to say good-bye. So let's get going.

664
00:39:00,802 --> 00:39:02,511
Promise me something...

665
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,913
Promise you won't kill
Mimi while I'm gone.

666
00:39:09,996 --> 00:39:13,527
And you'll give her food.

667
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,257
Why do you have to go?

668
00:39:16,843 --> 00:39:22,121
People are going to die if we
don't get these wind turbines...

669
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:26,750
You're all have.

670
00:39:30,623 --> 00:39:32,104
I'll be back.

671
00:39:53,069 --> 00:39:54,512
Take care of Bonnie, okay?

672
00:39:55,989 --> 00:39:58,002
Look, I just want to tell you something.

673
00:39:58,515 --> 00:40:01,116
- And don't freak out, okay?
- I won't.

674
00:40:03,356 --> 00:40:04,567
In this...

675
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:09,029
crazy world we don't know what's
going to happen tomorrow and...

676
00:40:09,314 --> 00:40:11,953
I don't wanna leave
anything unsaid, so...

677
00:40:12,086 --> 00:40:14,485
I'm just going to say it, okay?

678
00:40:14,683 --> 00:40:16,696
So here I go...

679
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,221
I've loved you since the
first day I saw you at Bailey's.

680
00:40:27,337 --> 00:40:29,825
You said it... you said it first.

681
00:40:32,251 --> 00:40:34,624
No one's ever said
it first to me before.

682
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,375
I don't know what's going
to happen tomorrow, and...

683
00:40:38,801 --> 00:40:39,947
Plus,

684
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:43,782
I can hold it over you
for the rest of our lives.

685
00:40:52,905 --> 00:40:54,766
I love you, Stanley Richmond.

686
00:40:57,842 --> 00:40:59,342
But I said it first.

687
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,808
It wasn't your fault, Eric.

688
00:41:16,777 --> 00:41:18,144
You don't have to do this.

689
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,722
I can't be here right now.

690
00:41:25,437 --> 00:41:26,500
I can't.

691
00:41:42,911 --> 00:41:44,430
Take care, son.

692
00:41:56,567 --> 00:41:57,725
Be strong.

693
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:18,911
I'm...

694
00:42:19,709 --> 00:42:21,209
I'm sorry, Mom.

695
00:42:23,848 --> 00:42:25,481
We'll take care of Mary.

696
00:42:33,148 --> 00:42:34,705
All right, let's move out.

697
00:42:54,776 --> 00:42:56,333
My dad told me what's happening.

698
00:42:57,488 --> 00:43:00,678
First you're helping us, and now this...
What the hell's going on?

699
00:43:00,753 --> 00:43:03,003
They're going to be fine.
I'm going to look after them.

00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:05,281
- You have to trust me on this.
- Trust?

701
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:07,953
This isn't me.

702
00:43:08,087 --> 00:43:09,120
Where's Heather?

703
00:43:09,189 --> 00:43:12,284
She's fine. I told her we were making
the trip. She didn't want to come.

704
00:43:12,853 --> 00:43:13,859
Truth.

705
00:43:15,739 --> 00:43:19,438
If anything happens to any of them,
you're the first one I come for.

706
00:43:22,988 --> 00:43:24,071
I know.
