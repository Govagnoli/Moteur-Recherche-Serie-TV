00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,000
<i>Previously on</i> Jericho

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,600
Some of them were on planes

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,200
that landed in the middle of nowhere.

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,000
They've been walking for weeks.

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,100
They must have gone through hell.

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,500
Oh, my God.

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,400
At the current levels of consumption,

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,799
we will be completely
out of gas and diesel in two weeks.

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,799
There's a woman in that
group of refugees that

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,000
Bill is processing.
I think you should talk to her.

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,600
Hello, Rob.

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,899
Someone on my team sold us all out.

13
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,999
You're smart enough to know

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,400
that they would say anything
to get you to talk, Sarah.

15
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,400
Get the package.

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,100
We're the United States Marines,

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,500
and we're here to help.

18
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,499
... and those are to restore lights,

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,900
power and infrastructure
to Kansas, one town at a time.

20
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,399
Something's wrong about all this,
all right? Trust me.

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,541
They've got somebody on the edge of town
pretending to be their headquarters.

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,000
Is any of this real?

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,399
- The gun's real.
- Hands up. Get them up!

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,900
What the hell do we do with them?

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,900
You will leave your weapons on the tank,

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,400
and you will move out!

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,100
- What do we do with that?
- Stanley,

28
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
got room in your barn?

29
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,400
- Seriously?
- Why not?

30
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,400
Never know when you might need a tank.

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,300
You're making too much noise.

32
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,500
Sorry.

33
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,700
Where did it go?

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There it is.

35
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,900
- It's locked.
- We shouldn't go in.

36
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,900
Go in here.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,100
- Why do I have to?
- So we can eat.

38
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,100
You see it?

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
Katie?

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,500
<i>Come on, Jake,
there's a line here.

41
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,900
<i>Did you hear about the tank?

42
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,500
<i>Those Marines coming or what?

43
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,400
<i>Everybody, just calm down!
You'll get your share.

44
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,800
<i>You'll get your rations!

45
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,300
<i>People, please, back up!

46
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,000
How is Gray handling this?

47
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:57,099
You better get in there.

48
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,100
I think we really screwed
ourselves this time.

49
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,499
You said everyone in the shelter gets
half-rations until the Marines come.

50
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, the Marines aren't coming,
and you've known all along.

51
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,900
We did the best that we could.

52
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:08,899
People had to believe
that help was on the way.

53
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,999
And you know what?

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,100
Half-rations is a lot more than
those refugees had before they got here.

55
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,900
Did you know about this?

56
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,900
The Marines...
That they were con artists?

57
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,600
Yeah, but we didn't give them
any of our supplies.

58
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,600
And Gray is right. The last thing
this town needs is to lose hope.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,100
Hope won't keep
my friends from starving.

60
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,700
I've got one woman too weak to walk.

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,200
It's a mathematical problem.

62
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,799
We've got your friends,
plus another 50 who migrated here.

63
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
That's too many people,
and not enough food.

64
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,350
We'll just have to figure out
how to make what we have last.

65
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,900
I say the first thing we do,

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,800
is stop giving it away to strangers.

67
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,500
What if we cut
the food rations in half,

68
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
again?

69
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:32,999
It's more than the food.
What about medicine?

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,216
Those refugees came here sick.

71
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:36,299
They've been burning through
our meds for a month.

72
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,100
Can we make it to spring, Harry?

73
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,100
Some of us can. Not all.

74
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,900
Crime's been going up
since they got here.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,699
Crime's been going up
since the bombs.

76
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,200
It's got to be done.
The numbers speak for themselves.

77
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,099
Just look at 'em.

78
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:50,300
I don't need to look at 'em.
I see them in my sleep.

79
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
What are you going to do?

80
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,700
Folks?

81
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Folks, listen up!

82
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,699
I am sorry to say that

83
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,000
the town no longer has the resources
to take care of you.

84
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,000
<i>What?
Where are we supposed to go?

85
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,499
So if you could please
gather up your belongings,

86
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,899
you will be escorted
to a FEMA camp out

87
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,400
- near I-70.
- We've been to those FEMA camps.

88
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,000
We barely made it out
alive the first time.

89
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,200
FEMA has medicine and supplies,
and we don't.

90
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,900
You heard the mayor.

91
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,000
You need to start packing up.

92
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,400
What are you going to do,
put us in jail?

93
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Great.

94
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,600
If I didn't have to do this,

95
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,000
- I wouldn't.
- We've been working!

96
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,400
Okay? We've been chopping wood!

97
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,900
Jessica's been helping you
with your medical center.

98
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,900
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,500
But if you put us out on the...

100
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,600
This isn't a debate.

101
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,300
You're right.

102
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,800
'Cause we're staying.

107
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
Anything?

108
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,700
Static.

109
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,199
No news.

110
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,099
I guess now the secret
about the tank is out,

111
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,499
there's no need to hide the radio.

112
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,800
Yeah. I'll take it down
to Bailey's later.

113
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,400
We can all be annoyed together.

114
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Emily.

115
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,199
Gray's trying to kick out the refugees.

116
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,048
They barricaded themselves
inside the church.

117
00:06:36,049 --> 00:06:37,300
Was anybody hurt?

118
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,699
Is there another door?

119
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,100
No. They blocked that one, too.

120
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Look, Roger, I'm sorry, but...

121
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,849
You lie about the Marines,

122
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,299
you get caught, you need someone
to blame, so you pick them.

123
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,899
We have taken in almost
a hundred people since the bombs.

124
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,600
Roger, you brought over 50 yourself.

125
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,900
We've done our part.

126
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,100
It's time for somebody else
to share the burden.

127
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,000
- Now, these FEMA camps...
- Those FEMA camps are jungles.

128
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,499
Putting anybody out on those streets
is a death sentence.

129
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,600
You've been out there.
You know that.

130
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,599
Look, it comes down to ressources.

131
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,732
All right? And people of Jericho
have to come first.

132
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,416
It's 100 of them or 100 of us.

133
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Let me work on Gray.

134
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,300
You and Emily try and talk
some sense into the refugees.

135
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Don't give Gray
a reason to make this worse.

136
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,350
All right? Gray can't send
these people away like this.

137
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
It's his call.

138
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,800
Well, isn't there
something we can do?

139
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,299
Give them warm clothing for the trip.

140
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,200
We've given away
everything we can spare.

141
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Well, there's...

142
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,700
What?

143
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,300
April's things?

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,200
Kyle, what are you doing?

145
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,899
We're not leaving here without a fight.

146
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,900
- This is a bad idea.
- What should we do?

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,500
We take down the barricade.

148
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,599
We go out unarmed.
We look them in the eye,

149
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,599
and we ask them to stay
till the end of winter.

150
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,700
Look them in the eye.

151
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,900
That's your plan?

152
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,700
- You don't know this town.
- Apparently, that makes two of us.

153
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,600
Where did you get the food from?

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,100
You stole it.

155
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,199
You broke into people's houses?

156
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,599
It's not like you didn't do the same
thing when we were out there.

157
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,999
Yeah, well, this is different.
This town took care of us!

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,500
We took care of us!

159
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,600
Because we knew,
one day, this town wouldn't.

160
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
What do you see?

161
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,200
Looks like Simmons has got
his nephew guarding the shed.

162
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,800
I don't think I can get in.

163
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,200
You have to.

164
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,900
You traded them for that gas,
and they're holding out on you.

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,300
You can't let these farmers
get away with it anymore.

166
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,500
It's easy for you to say.

167
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,100
I'll go this time.

168
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,100
Very funny.

169
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,500
What? You think you're
the only badass here?

170
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,000
- Uh... yeah.
- You want to bet?

171
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,500
Forget it, Skylar. Simmons is not
a pushover like Frederickson.

172
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,800
Neither am I.

173
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

174
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,700
You could get hurt.

175
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,900
You're worried about me?

176
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,700
That's so sweet.

177
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,600
Now, watch and learn.

178
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Found them!

179
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,299
Tear gas?

180
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,315
Gray, those things been
sitting around for years.

181
00:09:59,316 --> 00:10:02,000
You can't do this, Gray.
I've given these people sanctuary.

182
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:03,599
Reverend, this is a police matter now.

183
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,299
You have no right
to assault these people.

184
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,399
They've committed no crimes.

185
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,199
- They'll be my responsibility.
- What, are you going to feed them?

186
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,500
What, you got a little hospital
down there, Reverend?

187
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,100
No, I didn't think so.

188
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,800
What's that sound?

189
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,400
They're boarding up the windows.

190
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,499
There were half a dozen other places
we could have stopped,

191
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,000
but you kept talking like Jericho
was the end of the freakin' rainbow.

192
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,300
So we kept walking...
losing people... for this.

193
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,399
Out of my way, Johnston!
I know what I'm doing.

194
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,800
You know why we never used those?
A little thing called Waco happened.

195
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,900
The FBI used tear gas,

196
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,599
and they swear it didn't start
that fire, but it could have.

197
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,131
- You ready to live with that?
- Dad!

198
00:10:45,132 --> 00:10:46,700
We can't hold off a town.

199
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,399
- It's too big a gamble.
- It's not a gamble for you!

200
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,699
You get to go home
to a warm bed every night.

201
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,500
I told you... I'm with you.

202
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,800
What happens when
we get kicked out of this town?

203
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
<i>Come on!

204
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,900
What are you doing?
Get out of the way!

205
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,500
<i>She's got no pulse.

206
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,400
Hank! Hank!

207
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,099
- Skylar!
- Thank God. There are men on the road!

208
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,900
- Men? What men?
- They're with Ravenwood.

209
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,200
Is your uncle here?

210
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,599
- No, it's just me.
- We have to hide!

211
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,200
Okay, yeah. Come on!

212
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,000
How many were there?

213
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,400
I don't know. Five, maybe six.

214
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,600
I can't see them.

215
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:14,866
You know what?

216
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:17,100
I bet you have
a better view from the hayloft.

217
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,700
- I'm right behind you.
- Okay.

218
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,700
Skylar!

219
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,700
Stop!

220
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,700
It's okay. I'll wait.

221
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,499
One of the refugees is still out there.

222
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,399
You have the rangers search the barns.

223
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,600
Use dogs if it'll help.

224
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,400
And the rest of them?

225
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,200
Take them to the med center,
get them fixed up, Harry.

226
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,400
Then send them away.

227
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,100
What about the extra food
you promised them?

228
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,599
Give it to them.

229
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,000
- After what they did to us?
- Will you just do it,

230
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,000
before somebody else gets hurt?!

231
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,400
It's not too late.

232
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,399
Just let them stay until spring.

233
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,200
You think I haven't tried
to make that work?

234
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,600
The numbers don't add up.

235
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,900
- They're good people, Gray. Just...
- And?!

236
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,100
Good people are dying every day!

237
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,399
Someone finally has to tell the truth.

238
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,800
It's musical chairs out there.
The music has stopped!

239
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,200
Oh, my God!

240
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,999
Oh, my God, get away from me!

241
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,100
Get away from me!

242
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,899
A hundred counts of murder, Gray.

243
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,499
That's what they should charge you with
if you send them away.

244
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,299
We have been feeding them
and we have been heating the shelter.

245
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,099
We've been taking
from my friends

246
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,900
to give to strangers,
so don't you dare lecture me!

247
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,800
Whatever happens to them is on you!

248
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,899
Let me go, please!

249
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,800
- I don't want to hurt you!
- Just let me go, please!

250
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,199
You're not leaving
until this is resolved!

251
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,000
This is resolved!
Get out of my way!

252
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,600
- They're not going anywhere.
- You want to bet?

253
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,000
Just take whatever you want!
Just get out!

254
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,900
And go where?!

255
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,400
I got the entire police force
guarding the refugees,

256
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,000
and one way or another,
they're going.

257
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,000
Hey, stop it!

258
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,600
All right, stop it!

259
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,700
What's going on?
What happened?

260
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,099
Gray pulled a gun.
It was an accident.

261
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,300
Like hell! He shot me!

262
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,099
There's so much blood.

263
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,399
He needs a doctor.

264
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,999
- Get-get Kenchy.
- No, get Jessica.

265
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,599
Shut up!
You're not running things!

266
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Get Jessica, please, all right?
I trust her.

267
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,800
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

268
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,300
What are you looking for?

269
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,700
Superglue.

270
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,900
The sole on my boot came apart
after a couple hundred miles.

271
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,500
My son's shoes might fit you.

272
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,100
I'd rather fix these.

273
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,700
Why?

274
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
They're all I have left that are mine.

275
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,400
Where are you going to go?

276
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,400
I don't know really.

277
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,900
My family was in Chicago.

278
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,699
I wish there was more
that we could do.

279
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,900
Ma'am,

280
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,399
there are empty houses
all over Jericho,

281
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,200
and we sleep in a shelter.

282
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,900
Those are our neighbors' homes.

283
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,299
They were gone
when the bombs went off.

284
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,000
They're coming back.

285
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
Well, wherever your neighbors are,

286
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,300
I hope nobody's kicking them
out of town in the middle of winter.

287
00:20:35,964 --> 00:20:37,605
What the hell happened in there?

288
00:20:37,644 --> 00:20:39,175
- Gray's bleeding badly.
- I'm busy.

289
00:20:39,176 --> 00:20:40,850
- I need your help!
- Get Kenchy.

290
00:20:40,975 --> 00:20:42,884
Look, you're the only
one Roger trusts.

291
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:44,934
You want me to save
Gray Anderson?

292
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,959
If Gray dies, so does Roger.

293
00:20:47,178 --> 00:20:49,306
People aren't just going
to let it go. Please?

294
00:20:57,914 --> 00:20:59,260
We can all get out of this.

295
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:00,793
I was just trying to help them.

296
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:03,124
Now... there's no way the
town lets them stay.

297
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:05,127
It was an accident.
I saw it.

298
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:06,926
Gray...

299
00:21:07,348 --> 00:21:08,495
just until spring.

300
00:21:08,745 --> 00:21:09,872
That's all I ask.

301
00:21:10,857 --> 00:21:11,870
Come on!

302
00:21:13,012 --> 00:21:14,012
You were right.

303
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,144
This is on me.

304
00:21:15,238 --> 00:21:16,349
I brought them here.

305
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:17,537
I did it...

306
00:21:17,913 --> 00:21:19,462
I did it for my own reasons.

307
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,433
But don't punish them,

308
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:22,891
I'm begging you.

309
00:21:23,427 --> 00:21:24,553
Just till spring.

310
00:21:25,336 --> 00:21:26,349
Go to hell.

311
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:31,656
I've got Jessica. Let us in.

312
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:37,070
You need to let me look at him.

313
00:21:38,352 --> 00:21:40,026
You give them a chance...

314
00:21:40,918 --> 00:21:42,029
...I'll give you a chance.

315
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,688
I was going to give you
food, an escort.

316
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:46,362
We wouldn't survive out there...

317
00:21:46,377 --> 00:21:48,411
you know that.
We have to stay here.

318
00:21:49,256 --> 00:21:51,055
Why would you die over this?!

319
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:54,575
He's our only leverage.

320
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,821
Roger, this isn't you.

321
00:21:57,478 --> 00:22:00,044
I survived out there
for three months.

322
00:22:00,216 --> 00:22:03,580
You have no idea what
I can do if I have to.

323
00:22:55,251 --> 00:22:56,956
- Any sign of her?
- No.

324
00:22:58,145 --> 00:22:59,498
Check the buildings.

325
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:02,142
She's got to be around
here somewhere.

326
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,149
Hold up.

327
00:23:20,196 --> 00:23:21,980
She changed the location again.

328
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:23,607
Meet you back at the road.

329
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:03,668
Bill, don't!

330
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,164
You think I want to?

331
00:24:07,236 --> 00:24:09,956
Roger's a friend of mine, but I can't
let the mayor bleed to death.

332
00:24:09,972 --> 00:24:12,225
What if you miss?
What if you hit Emily?

333
00:24:12,366 --> 00:24:13,523
Get off me.

334
00:24:13,993 --> 00:24:16,316
If I get the shot, Jake...
I'm taking it.

335
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:17,822
Damn it.

336
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:24,934
We have to get him help.

337
00:24:24,981 --> 00:24:26,311
He didn't want to do this.

338
00:24:26,326 --> 00:24:28,329
It doesn't matter what
we want, does it?

339
00:24:28,407 --> 00:24:29,784
It matters what we do.

340
00:24:30,363 --> 00:24:32,318
I tried to get us all back here.

341
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:35,588
I promised them if we
just stuck together.

342
00:24:35,955 --> 00:24:37,535
- And you did.
- Yeah.

343
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:40,039
Emily, most of us made it back.

344
00:24:41,008 --> 00:24:42,557
19 of us didn't.

345
00:24:50,726 --> 00:24:51,821
What's going on?

346
00:24:54,387 --> 00:24:57,344
And I remember...
every one of their faces.

347
00:25:07,668 --> 00:25:09,350
- Get away from the window!
- Jake, what are you doing?!

348
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:11,556
- I told you to stay out!
- Get away from the window!

349
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:13,273
Get away from the window!

350
00:25:13,922 --> 00:25:15,674
Roger, get away from
the window!

351
00:25:17,481 --> 00:25:19,265
Roger, get away from
the window!

352
00:25:33,772 --> 00:25:35,415
If you want your friends to live...

353
00:25:35,572 --> 00:25:38,403
you better back the hell off
right now and listen to me!

354
00:25:38,873 --> 00:25:40,171
Roger, he's here to help.

355
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:41,345
I'm listening.

356
00:25:42,405 --> 00:25:44,455
What if we give you
transportation?

357
00:25:44,939 --> 00:25:46,363
And food and fuel?

358
00:25:47,036 --> 00:25:48,491
So we can die out there?

359
00:25:48,554 --> 00:25:50,290
- Guy is that what you think about?
- No!

360
00:25:50,369 --> 00:25:52,293
You can make it to
the migration trail.

361
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:53,732
Head south and beat the winter.

362
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:55,508
It's not your decision to make.

363
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:57,401
Won't be yours either if you're dead.

364
00:25:58,105 --> 00:25:59,732
You can't keep us in here forever.

365
00:25:59,857 --> 00:26:01,140
This will end.

366
00:26:01,194 --> 00:26:03,431
And when it does,
you can forget about staying.

367
00:26:03,432 --> 00:26:05,215
They will kick you out
with nothing.

368
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:15,845
I'm going to need guns.

369
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,378
I can't give you guns.

370
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:20,069
I can't protect a hundred
people with what I have.

371
00:26:22,515 --> 00:26:24,877
But you let Jessica take Gray
to the medical center.

372
00:26:25,018 --> 00:26:26,223
He's not leaving.

373
00:26:26,348 --> 00:26:30,009
Roger, if that bullet is still in him,
I'm going to have to open him up.

374
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:34,829
Is it a deal?

375
00:26:42,793 --> 00:26:44,835
You make sure everything's ready.

376
00:26:45,414 --> 00:26:46,509
I'll let him go.

377
00:27:04,366 --> 00:27:05,446
Hey, Allie.

378
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:07,574
Dad, you can't be around here.

379
00:27:07,575 --> 00:27:08,731
Mom will freak out.

380
00:27:08,747 --> 00:27:10,640
I won't stay long.
Come on.

381
00:27:19,957 --> 00:27:21,005
So...

382
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:24,588
I just wanted to know
how you were doing.

383
00:27:25,806 --> 00:27:28,278
Settling in okay at
Jimmy's place?

384
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,454
- Yeah, he just never stops talking.
- No...

385
00:27:32,658 --> 00:27:34,192
He doesn't.

386
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,230
ow's Sam?

387
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,594
You know, he gets scared.

388
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,362
And you?

389
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:46,083
I'm fine.

390
00:27:47,144 --> 00:27:48,146
Look...

391
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,697
that thing you had
to do to Sarah...

392
00:27:52,918 --> 00:27:54,905
I know how that can
change people.

393
00:27:55,249 --> 00:27:56,250
Dad...

394
00:27:56,266 --> 00:27:57,423
don't worry about me.

395
00:27:58,521 --> 00:28:00,562
I'm not Sam, and
I'm not Mom.

396
00:28:03,738 --> 00:28:04,818
So...

397
00:28:05,728 --> 00:28:08,450
you're not going to live with
us anymore... are you ?

398
00:28:08,873 --> 00:28:11,016
I don't think it's a good
idea right now.

399
00:28:15,447 --> 00:28:16,589
Then don't worry.

400
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:18,435
I'll take care of them.

401
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:20,000
Come here.

402
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:24,850
You are not me.

403
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:52,387
Thank you for helping me.

404
00:28:52,434 --> 00:28:53,874
Just try to keep still.

405
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,256
It's my job, you know.

406
00:29:00,151 --> 00:29:01,434
I didn't want to do it.

407
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,061
I had to.

408
00:29:03,124 --> 00:29:06,331
We all have our jobs to do,
whether we want to do them or not.

409
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:11,410
Just hang on.

410
00:29:31,077 --> 00:29:32,704
The bus is here.

411
00:29:37,836 --> 00:29:39,557
When do you think you'll come back?

412
00:29:39,604 --> 00:29:40,715
After this...

413
00:29:41,873 --> 00:29:44,001
he's never going to
let me come back.

414
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:49,258
Maybe I shouldn't have
brought them here.

415
00:29:49,367 --> 00:29:50,869
There were other places...

416
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:52,168
camps...

417
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,889
towns we heard about.

418
00:29:56,681 --> 00:29:58,042
But I had to see you.

419
00:30:03,484 --> 00:30:04,939
A refugee broke into the house.

420
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,316
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

421
00:30:06,332 --> 00:30:07,474
I'll get the guys.

422
00:30:07,693 --> 00:30:08,741
Listen to me.

423
00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:10,603
We can't let this happen.

424
00:30:12,621 --> 00:30:13,716
We're ready.

425
00:30:18,738 --> 00:30:19,740
Get up.

426
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:23,217
Wait, you can't take him.

427
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:25,282
Once my friends and I...

428
00:30:25,454 --> 00:30:27,019
are safely out of town...

429
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:28,135
I'll let him go.

430
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:29,929
He'll be dead by then.

431
00:30:31,932 --> 00:30:34,553
You can't let them go out there.

432
00:30:35,851 --> 00:30:38,714
A woman died on Main Street today.

433
00:30:39,183 --> 00:30:41,483
I didn't even know her name.

434
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:42,670
Did you?

435
00:30:43,335 --> 00:30:46,073
If you need a hostage,
take me.

436
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,702
Think of our neighbors who
haven't made it back yet.

437
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,674
That's who they are.

438
00:30:52,808 --> 00:30:54,418
Now my family can feed two people.

439
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,453
Now my family can feed two people.

440
00:30:57,108 --> 00:30:59,893
Who else here is willing
to share their rations?

441
00:31:01,645 --> 00:31:02,881
They're coming out!

442
00:31:07,395 --> 00:31:08,803
All right, move back!

443
00:31:10,055 --> 00:31:11,228
Move back!

444
00:31:11,546 --> 00:31:12,839
Come on, people, we can do this.

445
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,091
I know we can, please.

446
00:31:16,047 --> 00:31:17,830
Thank you, Bob. Yeah.

447
00:31:18,175 --> 00:31:20,193
Right. Good.
Who else?

448
00:31:20,428 --> 00:31:22,759
Come on, who else? Please.

449
00:31:23,322 --> 00:31:24,386
Please.

450
00:31:24,754 --> 00:31:26,130
Everybody, get back!

451
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:29,322
Get back!

452
00:31:30,137 --> 00:31:31,467
Keep your guns down.

453
00:31:32,202 --> 00:31:33,204
Keep them down.

454
00:31:36,489 --> 00:31:37,944
Move back!
Move back!

455
00:31:38,945 --> 00:31:40,421
- Move back!
- My God.

456
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,838
Roger...

457
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:46,757
it's over.

458
00:31:50,468 --> 00:31:51,876
They can stay.

459
00:31:53,347 --> 00:31:54,990
We found them homes.

460
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:57,821
Just put the gun down, Roger.

461
00:31:58,385 --> 00:31:59,394
You won.

462
00:31:59,422 --> 00:32:00,791
Come on, put it down.

463
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,980
How's the mayor?

464
00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:39,094
Jessica did a great job.
He's, um...

465
00:32:39,892 --> 00:32:42,568
he's lost a lot of blood,
but he's stable.

466
00:32:45,989 --> 00:32:48,367
We talked him into letting
the others stay.

467
00:32:52,318 --> 00:32:53,335
But, um...

468
00:32:55,353 --> 00:32:56,354
Not me.

469
00:33:07,239 --> 00:33:08,303
Well...

470
00:33:10,047 --> 00:33:11,862
I'd say I'd call you, but...

471
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:25,704
I'm coming with you.

472
00:33:26,064 --> 00:33:27,222
No, you're not.

473
00:33:27,332 --> 00:33:28,959
Roger, I-I am, so...

474
00:33:30,054 --> 00:33:31,149
I did this

475
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:33,764
so the people I love
can be safe here.

476
00:33:34,656 --> 00:33:38,066
I'm not taking the person I love
the most out on those roads.

477
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,006
I can handle it.

478
00:33:41,829 --> 00:33:42,940
I can't.

479
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:17,148
So... what do you think?

480
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,074
Well, it's no Saks Fifth Avenue,
but...

481
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:21,889
it's pretty great.

482
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:24,063
Thanks to all the deals we made,

483
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:25,971
we have a real trading post now.

484
00:34:33,684 --> 00:34:34,748
Hi, Mr. Simmons.

485
00:34:35,405 --> 00:34:37,016
Hank.
- What?!

486
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,973
You think this is a joke?
I could've shot you.

487
00:34:40,073 --> 00:34:42,122
Talk to your uncle, Hank.
He's the one that broke the deal.

488
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:44,109
You're just a real big man,
aren't you?

489
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:47,927
Just give me my horse
and the gas, and I'll be on my way.

490
00:34:48,803 --> 00:34:51,045
The horse is tied up in the alley,
but the gas is mine.

491
00:34:51,076 --> 00:34:52,609
I'm through playing
games with you.

492
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,939
Hank, get the gas.

493
00:35:04,732 --> 00:35:06,219
Meet my new employees.

494
00:35:32,619 --> 00:35:35,482
This is, um,
Jim and Judy Moore's house.

495
00:35:36,062 --> 00:35:38,417
They were visiting their grandchildren

496
00:35:39,574 --> 00:35:41,463
just outside of Philadelphia.

497
00:35:47,716 --> 00:35:49,929
Rations are on Tuesday.

498
00:35:50,457 --> 00:35:52,873
We'll be by to share them with you.

499
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:00,751
Mrs. Green.

500
00:36:03,614 --> 00:36:04,914
Thank you.

501
00:37:53,964 --> 00:37:56,765
We got together
some canned food and water.

502
00:37:57,456 --> 00:37:59,202
I wish I had more.

503
00:38:11,097 --> 00:38:12,924
Nothing I say is going to...

504
00:38:13,574 --> 00:38:15,279
is going to sound right, so...

505
00:38:16,782 --> 00:38:18,751
Are you really sad to see me go?

506
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:21,959
It's not about that.

507
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:24,219
Here.

508
00:38:32,055 --> 00:38:34,004
Take Cedar Run first, it's clear,

509
00:38:34,005 --> 00:38:35,608
and then head to New Bern.

510
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,064
Heather, Stanley, my brother,

511
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,750
they can help you
once you're there.

512
00:38:40,155 --> 00:38:41,942
I know my way around.

513
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:05,008
<i>Bodies were found

514

00:40:10,186 --> 00:40:12,637
Wait, I've heard that voice before.

517
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,874
Oh, yeah, that's the guy that does
the farm report. It's real news.

518
00:40:16,233 --> 00:40:17,836
<i>... to research laboratories.

Jimmy, what is it?
