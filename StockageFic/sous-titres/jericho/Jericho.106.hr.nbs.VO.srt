1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,660
previously on jericho

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,960
O: All right,it looks like the explosion came from the west,maybe denver.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,200
If it was an attack and there's chaos out there

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,270
you might not want the wrong people knowing that jericho is still here.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,690
Johnston: The unfortunate truth is,there was another explosion in atlanta.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,780
So,do we have a plan?

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,490
I will talk to april.

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,280
Tonight.

9
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,730
Secrets of a small town.

10
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,580
Divorce papers.

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,940
I had them drawn up before the bombs went off.

12
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,020
I don't want it.

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,530
The train that never showed up-- smashed into a car.

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,140
There's a ton of food just sitting on it.

15
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,180
If I knew anything I would tell your mayor.

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,580
hello.

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,290
This assistant secretary walsh from the department of homeland security.

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,490
Stay where you are.

19
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,360
Do not attempt to leave.

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,580
what's going on?

21
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,230
All right,everybody calm down,all right?

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,110
We'll have it back in a second.

23
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,380
are those ours or theirs?

24
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,390
They're headed up.

25
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,790
They must be ours.

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,620
Nearest missile silo's in wyoming,100 miles away.

27
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,990
So this is it?

28
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,650
We're at war?

29
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,140
enter psw

30
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,660
what's the target?
ours ot theirs

31
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,610
i'm compromised

32
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,000
Dad?

33
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:21,730
Hey,I want you to get your mom and samuel down here,and you wait for me until I come out.

34
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,280
What are you...
no,now,baby,now.

35
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,380
Well,if we're sending missiles,they must have figured out who attacked us.

36
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,660
God bless america.

37
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,990
Could have just decided to take out one of the usual suspects.

38
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,470
Which means there could be more missiles headed in our direction.

39
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,310
Well,is this the federal response we've all been waiting for?

40
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,020
end transmission

41
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,170
robert,the circuit breaker wasn't the breaker.

42
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,920
It was an emp.

43
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,020
It's an electromagnetic pulse.

44
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,380
Fries anything with a circuit board.

45
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:24,410
That means all electronics,appliances,anything with wires.

46
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,160
Does that mean another bomb has gone off somewhere?

47
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,340
What the hell was that?

48
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,610
Jake: It was an emp.

49
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,550
Everything's dead.

50
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,050
Well,is help on its way or not?

51
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,080
I don't think so.

2 weeks later

55
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,120
oh,dude!

56
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,000
Slow down.

57
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,140
What's the matter with you,huh?

58
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,710
Dale,hey,whoa,whoa,whoa.

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,410
What are you doing?

60
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,770
He broke our window,you saw him.

61
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,010
Dale.

62
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,660
Thanks a lot.

63
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,960
Dale,hold up.

64
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,070
What?

65
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,440
You all right?

66
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,850
They tried to break into the store twice this week.

67
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,930
Oh,that's terrible.

68
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,310
You got a problem?
Not me.

69
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,630
Dale's my buddy.

70
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,330
Right,dale?

71
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,210
You can't go around shoving people in the street,all right?

72
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,390
If you got a problem,you take it up with jimmy or bill.

73
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,590
All they'll do is write a report.

74
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,680
All right,well,then,come to me.

75
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,800
I can take care of myself.

76
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,850
There's got to be an easier way.

77
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,820
Maybe we can rig up the washing machine to work with the hand crank or something?

78
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,780
I'll be back tonight.

79
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,740
Where are you going,dad?

80
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,110
To the station.

81
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,330
So why you heading off to play cop?

82
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,610
Because people are starting to react to the fact that no one is coming to save them.

83
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,640
Okay?No one.

84
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,860
Because the world we knew does not exist anymore.

85
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:48,800
So if we can't keep order,we will not survivE.

86
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,980
Alison,give me a minute with your father.

87
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,610
Mom,I just...
now.

88
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,790
What the hell are you doing scaring our kids about the end of the world,robert?

89
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,400
Well,they have to understand what's going on.

90
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,400
You haven't been around for four years.

91
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,670
I'm the parent here,okay?

92
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,320
I'll decide what they need.

93
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,760
We cannot have photos up.

94
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,540
They might raise questions about us as a family.

95
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm not in this.

96
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,270
Get rid of them,darcy.

97
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,070
People are trespassing on my land.

98
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,650
Well,we don't have the resources to control the whole town,carla.

99
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,020
You have to keep an eye on your own properties.

100
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,310
Our street's got a busted water main.My whole front lawn is flooded.

101
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,280
I'm trying to get some men on that right now.
Where's mayor green?

102
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,780
He is home recuperating from the flu.

103
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,120
Then who's running this town?

104
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:52,570
The mayor is still in charge,and,you know,these guys are doing the best job they can with a short staff.

105
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,640
Who the hell are you?

106
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,460
He is a volunteer and a deputy.

107
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,770
Now settle down and we'll get to you.

108
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,900
But you have to be patient.

109
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,180
Please.

110
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,990
Mary: How's your brother?

111
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,160
Eric pretty much keeps to himself.

112
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,280
Spends a lot of time at work making sure the town stays on its feet.

113
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,790
Really?

114
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,710
That's odd.

115
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,690
I just figured he'd be spending a little more time with his wife.

116
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,380
You know,now that they've lost the house and all.

117
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,730
They seem pretty happy together.

118
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,250
Man: Mitchell,wait up.

119
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,520
Looking good,mary.

120
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,640
We are not doing this again,mitch.

121
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,680
You're not welcome here.

122
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,910
Oh,come on,with everything that's happened,I'm just looking for a cold beer.

123
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,600
Well,we haven't served cold anything in a long time.

124
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,000
All right,just give me whatever you got.

125
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,820
Or I'll get it myself.

126
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,450
You might want to rethink that.

127
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,620
Everyone thought you went up in the blast.

128
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,240
But I knew you'd find a way to survive.

129
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,310
Oh,come on,let's not do it like this.

130
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,870
Besides,anyone should have a grudge,it's me,right?

131
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,230
I mean,you left me holding the bad when you blew town.

132
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,130
You know what,you're right.

133
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,440
Don't make me kick your ass again.

134
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,650
Robert: HeY.

135
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,830
Is everything all right?

136
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,990
You travel with your own personal bodyguard now?

137
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,660
That's probably not a bad idea.

138
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,880
Robert: What's the trouble here?
Oh,no trouble.

139
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,020
We're just two old friends catching up.

140
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,160
Well,maybe you should do that some other place.

141
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,540
And some other time.

142
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,540
See you soon.

143
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,610
Hey,mom.
Hi.

144
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,760
What are you doing home?

145
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,080
I'm just snagging another citation ledger.

146
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,260
Taken more complaints these last few days than we normally do in a month.

147
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,410
Well,jake and I are going out to the ranch to feed the horses in a little bit.

148
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,540
If you'd like to join us,maybe we could talk.

149
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,890
I'm sorry,I can'T.

150
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,420
With dad down,I'm struggling just to make sure things don't fall apart out there.

151
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,190
How 'bout things closer to home?

152
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,420
What's that supposed to mean?

153
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,070
How are you and april doing?

154
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,250
Why,did she say something?

155
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,940
Eric...

156
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,880
how's johnston?

157
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,230
I wish I had better news.

158
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,360
His fever's getting worse.

159
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:39,110
I'll try to dig up a stronger course of antibiotics at the med center,but we're running low on supplies.

160
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,260
God,if I could just get him to ear something.

161
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,250
Can you stay?
Don't worry about me,mom.

162
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,390
There's a box protein bars at the station.I'll just grab one of those.

163
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,370
Okay.

164
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,610
If you wait ten minutes,maybe we could walk together?

165
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,000
I got to go.

166
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,910
There's an important meeting.

167
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,850
Then that's where you should be.

168
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,710
We'll talk tonight.

169
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,460
Maybe we can put in a new starter.

170
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,330
No one can find a starter that works.

171
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,600
uncle sam!

172
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,030
To what do we owe the pleasure?

173
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,870
Can you please not call me that?

174
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,930
what did she say?

175
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,380
Oh,she says she likes your shoes.

176
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,820
Thank you.

177
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,670
I have a proposition.

178
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:43,900
The hotel I was staying in closed,and since you owe the government more than...$180,000...

179
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,520
no one's heard from the government in weeks.

180
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,000
Consider me the government.

181
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,910
Fine,then I still get to call you uncle sam.

182
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,690
Nice watch.

183
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,630
It's a rolex.

184
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,440
You got the time?

185
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,170
It's,um...

186
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,550
it just stopped working after the pulse,just like everyone else'S.

187
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,660
Well,I how about I pay you when it starts up again?

188
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,250
You're being an idiot.

189
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,000
I am trying to give you a chance to protect your interests.

190
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,530
You're too kind.
Hey,here's the deal.

191
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,570
You let me stay here,and I will deduct my room and board from what you owe the irs.

192
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,190
Fine,fine,why not?

193
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,840
I can use an extra field hand,and you can help bonnie with the cooking and the washing.

194
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,220
Okay,maybe you don't understand the nature of a deal.

195
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,210
I don't do housework.

196
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,400
Is that a cockroach?

197
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,540
We don't have cockroaches here.
Well,it landed right on me!

198
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,310
It's probably attracted to all that chicken crap in the yard.

199
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,440
Stanley,what's wrong?

200
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,580
What do you got there?

201
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,350
Rap sheet on mitchell cafferty.

202
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,370
Armed robbery,assault,gun-trafficking.

203
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,900
Yeah.

204
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,410
Mitch isn't one of jericho's finest.

205
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,130
What do you know about him?

206
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,520
Well,he hasn't given us trouble in a while.

207
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,510
He stays on the edge of town in a sort of compound with a bunch of guys.

208
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,140
Like survivalists?
I guess.

209
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,130
Why are you so interested?

210
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,620
Well,he was in bailey's this morning.

211
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,720
Had some words with your brother.

212
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,890
Looked like there was a bit of history there.

213
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,970
What did jake do about it?

214
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,990
Kept his cool,didn't engage.

215
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,230
Well,it's best we leave it alone,then.

216
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,950
Like you said,it's history.

217
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,790
Well,one thing that hasn't changed...

218
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,780
all this.

219
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,840
You remember when you first started riding?

220
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,430
Took to it like a fish to water.

221
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:58,560
You know,if you'd favored your father a little less and your dinky uncle dennis a little more,you would've been a hell of a jockey.

222
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,550
Talk to me.

223
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,140
I'm tired of hearing my own voice.

224
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,730
You okay?

225
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,210
Yeah,just tired.

226
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,250
I'm gonna get the water.

227
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,410
mom!Stay down!

228
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,930
Who are those guys?

229
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,100
xxxxxxxxx

230
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,400
I'll get you some aspirin for the pain and swelling.

231
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,800
I'm sorry I can't offer anything stronger.

232
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,160
I-it's okay,honey.

233
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,410
I don't need anything else.

234
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,610
Don't argue with her,gail-- doctor's orders.

235
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,710
Damn bastards.

236
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,260
Jake?

237
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,700
Where are you going?

238
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,960
To find mitch.
And then what?

239
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,130
I don't know yet.

240
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,990
Well,hold on,jake,you don't know for sure if he's behind this.

241
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,960
It was him.

242
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,140
You said yourself you didn't get a good look.

243
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,510
Now,look...

244
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:17,370
you know,I would like nothing better than to string up the guys who did this,but that's not the way we do things.

245
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,300
Last time you got mixed up with mitch cafferty,you left town and a boy was dead.

246
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,540
I'm not that guy anymore.Yeah?

247
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,980
Let's just make sure that it stays that way.

248
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,530
Look,if I don't care of him,he'll come back.

249
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,520
We've got to do this right.
You know that...

250
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:37,420
if this family starts breaking the law,how are we supposed to enforce it?

251
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,580
Gracie,you still have those crop pesticides?

252
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,360
Everything I got left is right there on that shelf.

253
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,320
Thank god.I'm gonna need everything you got to protect my corn.

254
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,060
Can anyone even eat that corn?

255
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,060
What about that rain we had?
No,it's okay.

256
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,250
The husks kept it safe from the fallout.

257
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,050
It was already mature,so the ears didn't take up any of that moisture.

258
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,010
You sure about that?

259
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,660
Gracie,you think I'd let my sister eat it if I didn't ink it was safe?

260
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,820
You think i would?

261
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,580
After what I've been exposed to?

262
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,950
I'll give you 20 bushels for those pesticides.

263
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:22,090
Well,I was thinking we'd split the harvest,half and half.

264
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,890
Half?

265
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,560
What are you,crazy?

266
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,700
Well,how you gonna sell your corn?

267
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,360
Give it to me,I'll sell it here,and we'll share the profit.

268
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,600
Mimi: Richmond farm belongs to the U.S.Treasury.

269
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,790
You're lucky we just don't commandeer what we need.

270
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,520
I'd like to see you try.

271
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,610
All right,let's go.

272
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,110
Hey,jimmy.

273
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,060
Eric,what's up?

274
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,770
Hey,mary.

275
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,310
Where the hell have you been?

276
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,650
We think mitch cafferty and his cohorts stole some horses.

277
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,570
I know they were here earlier; I thought maybe you might have heard something.

278
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,450
Anything you might know,mary,would really help.

279
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,990
There was a man here this afternoon.

280
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,150
I heard him say that he bought a horse from some guys out at the airfield.

281
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,370
The airfield.
All right.

282
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,710
Thanks.

283
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,740
Thanks.

284
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,540
Eric.

285
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,260
The last time I saw you,you were gonna tell your wife about us and we were gonna start our life together.

286
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,720
That thought has kept me going.

287
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,780
That was nearly two weeks ago.

288
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,170
I don't know...

289
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,020
what you're thinking,I don't know if you're okay.

290
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,760
I don't know if I'm okay,mary.

291
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,340
I know this is not what I wanted.

292
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,030
Mary,I think about you every minute of every day.

293
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,510
Man,I wake up in the morning,and I want it to be you there so badly.

294
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,430
I know I...

295
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:02,340
I'm still married,and I have a wife,and I owe her...

296
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,360
something.

297
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,830
I don't know what to say,mary.

298
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,880
I wish I did,but I don'T.

299
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,260
It's like a damn infirmary in here.

300
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,690
Thought it'd be at least 20 years before it came to this.

301
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,500
I'm hot!

302
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,530
I'll bet you didn't expect a house full of kids,either.

303
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,440
I'm worried about jake.

304
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,570
So am I.

305
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,950
I don't think I'll ever forget the night I got that call.

306
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,290
Went out there and saw that mitch cafferty in handcuffs,that other kid all covered in blood,and all I could think is...

307
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,710
one of those boys could've been jake.

308
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,380
oh,hi,stanley.
Hi.

309
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,950
Sorry to bother you,mrs.Green,mayor,but I,uh...

310
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,710
I need to talk to you.
What is it?

311
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,920
I found corn worms in my crop...

312
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,910
and I know this is a long shot,but I was hoping maybe you'd have some pesticides out at your ranch.

313
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,470
None of the other farms can spare 'em.

314
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,570
Sorry,stanley.Have you tried gracie's?

315
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,730
Yeah.She-she won't give 'em up.

316
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:54,890
You see,I need to kill these bugs,or I'd have to harvest what's good today,or it's-it's all gone.

317
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,640
Does she realize you have the biggest farm in jericho?

318
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,750
I mean,if we lose his crops,we all starve.

319
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,650
We're just gonna have to put together a crew as quick as we can,and we'll have to figure out how to ration it.

320
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,410
Stanley: Hang on a minute.

321
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,490
This is my corn.

322
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,230
Well,of course it is,stanley-- it's just right now we need you to share.

323
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,540
I mean,we're on our own here,and the town's nearly out of food.

324
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:18,660
Well,now,I'm willing to do my part,mayor,but I'm not giving up my crop.

325
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,260
Stanley,there'll be plenty enough for you and bonnie.

326
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,460
Plenty enough for everyone.

327
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:28,080
For 5,000 people plus livestock for god knows how many months?

328
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,240
I am not the only farm in this town.Why am I being targeted?

329
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,930
Stanley,nobody's being targeted.

330
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,630
It sure doesn't seem that way,sir-- all of a sudden everybody's laying claim to my crop-- the irs,gracie,and now you.

331
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,830
Stanley,we're just...

332
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,880
all due respect,I'll take care of it myself.

333
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,550
Oh,stanley,come and sit down,honey.

334
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,090
Stanley,come on back here,now.

335
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,120
hey,girl.

336
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,360
Jake.

337
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,040
Dale,what are you doing here?

338
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,400
I'm so sorry.I didn't know.

339
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,910
Didn't know what?
Jake!

340
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,060
jake?

341
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,050
You back away.

342
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,700
Get the hell out of here,dale.

343
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,620
No.

344
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:47,550
Stick around-- think of this as initiation.

345
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,410
You've crossed the line.

346
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,900
Excuse me?

347
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,030
You heard me.

348
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,980
Coming to our family's ranch.

349
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,640
I crossed the line?

350
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,050
I went to jail...

351
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,690
that night that you bailed on us.

352
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,150
My best friend...

353
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,510
had half of his head blown off.

354
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,420
I told you I wasn't gonna rob anybody.

355
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,920
Oh,come on,stop acting like an angel.

356
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,920
You come back to...settle down?

357
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,830
Raise a family,maybe do a little farming?

358
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,520
I never planned on staying.

359
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,290
Of course not.

360
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,270
But where you gonna go?

361
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,320
Cars don't work.

362
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,360
We're fresh out of horses.

363
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,340
Jake: If you...

364
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:37,110
or anybody ever come near my family again,I will kill you.

365
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,830
Now,that's the jake I know.

366
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,140
All right,now get uP.

367
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,320
I'm taking you to go see john.

368
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,920
stop!Sheriff!

369
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,610
Don't even move.

370
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,940
Where's mitchell?

371
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,240
Don't know.

372
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,980
I know you,sean.You're lying.

373
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,830
Dale?

374
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,000
You're next.

375
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,920
What am I gonna do about this?

376
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:54,770
Can't charge them with anything and the nearest judge is in the county seat and we don't even know if that exists anymore.

377
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,490
Is this about these kids?

378
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,990
Or mitchell cafferty?

379
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,530
He stole my mother's horses and he could have gotten her killed.

380
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:06,520
Oh,you had run-ins with this guy long before that,jake.

381
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,140
I've read his file.

382
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,600
He's gonna be a problem,right?

383
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:17,940
And now with the sheriff and half our deputies dead,mitchell and his kind are gonna prey on this town like locusts.

384
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,560
We need to stop them now.

385
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,030
Well,if it's information you want,first thing we do is separate them.

386
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,410
All right,I'll take sean into the hallway.

387
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,860
No.

388
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,350
I'll do it.

389
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,320
Get up.We're going for a walk.

390
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,440
Screw that,I don't have to...

391
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,260
Walk.

392
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,570
Some pesticides got stolen over at gracie'S.

393
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,560
Do you know anything about it?

394
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:05,400
No.I mean,I was there earlier trying to buy some,but...

395
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,020
but what?

396
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:13,630
All right.What's going on?Why are you acting like this?

397
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,070
Gracie came down to the station.

398
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,860
Started raising all kinds of hell.

399
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,610
She says you stole 'em.

400
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,250
She told you I stole them?

401
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,190
You mind if I take a look around?

402
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,370
Yeah,I do,bill.This is nuts!

403
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,080
What's going on?

404
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,810
I don't know.

405
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,110
One of my best friends is accusing me of stealing pesticides.

406
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,510
I'm gonna check the barn.

407
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,780
I didn't say you could go in there.

408
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,350
Watch it.

409
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,270
It's okay.Just let him do what he wants to do.

410
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,440
Fine,check the barn.

411
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,910
Check the whole damn house!

412
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,670
How you got mixed up with mitchell but you need to stay away from him.

413
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,410
I'm serious.You can wind up in jail or a lot worse.

414
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,440
How did you get mixed up with him?

415
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,750
I was stupid.

416
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,630
And bored and looking for trouble.

417
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,580
Are you looking for trouble?

418
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,010
Dale.

419
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,540
Why are they keeping you here?What'd you do?

420
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,390
I'm just talking to him.

421
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,200
You can't without an attorney.

422
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,370
I'm not a cop.
I'm bailing him out anyway.

423
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,830
I know the machines are down,but you have to take it.

424
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,180
Get out of here.

425
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:37,780
You're letting me go?

426
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,410
Jake: Yeah.

427
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,470
Just trying to talk some sense into you.

428
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:46,400
Believe me,you don't want to go down this road.

429
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,260
I think I know where mitchell is.

430
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,660
I'll show you.

431
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,940
dad?

432
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,010
Dad?

433
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,120
dad?

434
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,530
Come on,out of here.

435
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,540
Are all those cities gone?

436
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,150
What do you think?

437
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,390
How do you know?
I don't for sure.

438
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,840
Okay.

439
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:48,520
Those are the cities I heard about through the ham radio,and the satellite feed before the emp.

440
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,710
Home come your laptop wasn't fried like everything else?

441
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,140
It's ruggedized.

442
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,340
It is built to withstand an emp.

443
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,960
The,um...

444
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,870
the government issues them,baby.

445
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,710
So you're some kind of spy?

446
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,450
That's why you moved us here.

447
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,360
You knew this was gonna happen.

448
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,870
Why do you have that gun?What's it for?

449
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,410
Shooting.

450
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:23,780
And I think it's probably time you learned how.

451
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,900
You see,the way things are going...

452
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:29,040
you may have to defend yourself one day.

453
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,170
Do you understand?

454
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,880
Hey,what's going on?

455
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,430
We were just catching up.

456
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,130
Right?

457
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,500
You're clear.

458
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,280
Are you sure?

459
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,370
Because we can check the fields.We can go through them row by row.

460
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,390
We got a complaint.

461
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,020
So all you gotta do now is accuse someone?

462
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,960
Stanley.
No.

463
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,030
What about my word,bill?

464
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,800
I'm just doing my job,man.

465
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,940
Mimi: What are you doing?

466
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,630
I'm gonna burn the field.

467
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,050
You've completely lost your mind.What happened to you?

468
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,320
I'm not gonna burn the whole field,just the infested partS.

469
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,310
Oh,my god,stanley.

470
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,890
You don't need to do this.

471
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,060
Look,it's the only thing I can think of.

472
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,290
I got the pesticides.

473
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,950
What are you talking about?

474
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,560
I paid some kids to steal them from gracie's store.

475
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,750
We just have to get into town and pick them up.

476
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,020
You stole the pesticides?

477
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,610
What,am I talking to myself?

478
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,040
I paid someone to steal them.

479
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,450
I gave them my diamond watch.

480
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,860
I can't believe this is what we've come to.

481
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,540
We don't really have a choice,stanley.

482
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,310
It's every man for himself now.

483
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,240
He's finally asleep.
Great.

484
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,740
How are you feeling?

485
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:30,250
I'm hanging in there.

486
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,820
I'm sorry there isn't more I can do for him.

487
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:37,730
That's one obstinate guy in there.

488
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,300
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

489
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:46,070
Certainly not as far as jake's concerned.

490
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:51,760
I don't know as I've ever really thought of eric as being stubborn.

491
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:54,450
Hard to reach,then?

492
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:57,810
Well,he's had a lot on his plate.

493
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,850
Since the missiles...

494
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,480
not to mention your new living arrangement.

495
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,830
Yeah.

496
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:08,540
It started long before all of this.

497
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,320
I've been where you are.

498
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,050
Putting something back together...

499
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,460
isn't ever easy.

500
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:26,900
But somebody's got to take the first step.

501
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:32,170
Now,if you want to fight for this thing,start fighting.

502
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,910
You need to be smarter about who you hang out with.

503
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,390
I don't hang out with those guys.

504
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,760
I needed sean and mitch to help me move some stuff,that's all.

505
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,110
I didn't know about the horses.

506
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,330
Well,what did you think,dale?

507
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,140
Hey,you never should have tried to protect them.

508
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,410
I wasn'T.I was trying to protect gracie.

509
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,520
What do you mean?

510
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:52,570
A train crashed full of food supplies.

511
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,610
It's how I've been keeping gracie stocked.

512
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,620
I didn't want anyone to know about it.

513
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,010
It's all in there.

514
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,520
What?

515
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:20,940
This place was full.It was stacked to the rafters.

516
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,790
I guess we know who took it.

517
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,170
Gracie.

518
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,660
You get the hell out of my store.I know you stole from me.

519
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:35,150
No,I didn't,gracie.I swear I didn'T.

520
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,410
Gracie,how long have you known me?

521
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,770
My whole life,right?

522
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,840
We have to trust each other.

523
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,970
Just,just,let me show you.

524
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,050
Follow me.

525
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,120
You see,gracie?It's all here.

526
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,910
Nobody stole anything from anyone,okay?

527
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,710
It was a misunderstanding.

528
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,390
Eric: Do you have any idea where he would have moved it to?

529
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,570
Dale: No,no,I don'T.

530
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,710
You stay here.

531
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,640
Stop right there,mitchell!

532
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:30,180
Put your gun down.

533
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,400
Put your gun down!

534
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,450
Now put your hands up.

535
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,240
where's the food?

536
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,390
Eric: Jake...

537
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,440
stop.

538
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,640
Stop!

539
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,430
What are you doing?I said,"stop.

540
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,610
" Where's the food?

541
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,060
So what are we doing to do about him?

542
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,090
Eric: We lock him up for now.

543
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:07,350
Maybe we can send someone to fielding,see if the courthouse is still running.

544
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,920
His friends aren't going to let this go.

545
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:09,810
I can handle it.

546
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,710
Yeah,you handled it real good back at the barn.

547
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:14,310
I should have killed him.
Stop it,jake!

548
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,660
You're not that guy anymore.

549
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,870
What about these two?

550
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,620
Eric: Now I can see letting dale go,but sean helped steal the horses.

551
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,300
He's still a boy.

552
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,930
A boy who could have gotten you killed,mom.

553
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,910
Well,it doesn't matter,eric,because I'm not pressing charges.

554
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:38,310
This cell is too small to hold everybody who ever made a mistake.

555
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:42,700
What do you suggest?

556
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,960
Rehabilitation.

557
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,730
Okay.

558
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,680
Okay,hold it.

559
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:56,860
All fingers wrapped.

560
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:58,580
Okay,relax.

561
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,740
Right.

562
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,230
It's okay.

563
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,290
Breathe.

564
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,310
Nice.Stand with your legs like so.

565
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,950
A little further apart.

566
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:06,870
Right.

567
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,300
Now bend your knees,take your sight.

568
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,610
Try to keep your eyes open.

569
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,350
Squeeze.

570
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:21,430
Right.Good job,good job.

571
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,680
All right.

572
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,030
That's a very good job.

573
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,150
You like that?

574
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,790
are you sure this is going to work?

575
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,230
In theorY.

576
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,260
You've never done this before?

577
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,650
Nope.

578
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:42,380
Well,don't get it on your shoes.

579
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,790
Seriously,get away from me.

580
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,830
Oh,my god,I wish I prayed.

581
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,490
Gail: Stanley.

582
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:59,440
you said you needed to harvest today.

583
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:04,840
We're here to help,no strings attached.

584
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,890
thanks.

585
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,960
mom.

586
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,100
Well,hello.

587
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,900
I'm really sorry,mrs.Green.

588
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,950
I'm sorry for everything.

589
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:41,970
All right,well,go make yourselves useful.

590
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,000
forget it.

591
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,730
Man: Uncle sam.

592
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,040
You ever slept in a barn before?

593
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:07,030
You know,it's not like it is in the movies.

594
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:12,710
It can get pretty fragrant in there with all the pigs and goats brushing up against you.

595
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:13,990
You're bluffing.

596
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,120
Try me,please.

597
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,340
these are for you.

598
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,840
I lost my head,stanley.

599
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,510
I'm sorry.

600
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,740
Thank you.

601
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,290
you have any idea what you're doing?

602
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,710
not a clue.

603
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,290
thanks for your help.

604
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,210
this is our home,too.

605
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,910
Right.

606
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,330
is he a good man or a bad man?

607
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,370
baby,there's no such thing.

608
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,720
kind of cool,huh?

609
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,070
Yeah.

610
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,460
Especially if you like corn.

611
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,860
Tough work,huh?

612
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,560
Yeah.

613
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:12,760
I was thinking maybe when we leave here,we could,uh,I was going to say go for a walk,but we'll be too tired...

614
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:16,740
april,stop,please.Okay?

615
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:17,850
What?

616
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,480
This.

617
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,880
What you're doing.

618
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,010
It's making things worse.

619
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:28,340
I'm just trying to talk to you,get you to look at me,something.

620
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,970
Well,three weeks ago,you were asking about a divorce.

621
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,560
Three weeks ago,we lived on a different planet.

622
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,370
Things have changed.

623
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,120
Never mind.

624
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,070
april,wait.

625
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,600
There's always the walk home.

626
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,250
Why don't we start there,see how we feel.

627
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:39,390
this town...

628
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,450
jake.

629
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,320
You ready for this?

630
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:08,110
You know he's going to come for me.

631
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,700
And then,he's going to come looking for you.

632
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,920
There's no running away this time,jake.
