00:00:00,212 --> 00:00:01,601
Previously on Jericho

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:03,164
<i>Bring them inside.</i>

3
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:04,649
<i>Some of them were on planes</i>

4
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,559
<i>that landed in
the middle of nowhere.</i>

5
00:00:06,772 --> 00:00:08,373
<i>They've been walking
for weeks.</i>

6
00:00:08,682 --> 00:00:10,389
<i>They must have gone
through hell.</i>

7
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,381
<i>Oh, my God... Roger.</i>

8
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:16,460
<i>You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.</i>

9
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:18,120
<i>You need to keep
them clean and warm.</i>

10
00:00:18,196 --> 00:00:19,740
<i>Do you know anyone
in Jericho?</i>

11
00:00:19,914 --> 00:00:22,152
<i>Actually... I do.</i>

12
00:00:23,822 --> 00:00:24,921
<i>Hello, Rob.</i>

13
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,449
<i>We're using the generator
to power the town hall</i>

14
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,793
<i>for three hours a day,
the Med Center for six.</i>

15
00:00:29,994 --> 00:00:33,352
<i>With 53 new people, at current
levels of consumption...</i>

16
00:00:33,773 --> 00:00:37,149
<i>we will be completely out
of gas and diesel in two weeks.</i>

17
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:39,868
<i>- Mrs. Green?
- What?</i>

18
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,884
<i>Eric told me that
April's pregnant.</i>

19
00:00:42,203 --> 00:00:43,572
<i>It's the Old Man.</i>

20
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,174
<i>He's coming for us
using us against each other.</i>

21
00:00:46,232 --> 00:00:49,377
<i>We go see him and if,
if he is behind this,</i>

22
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:50,592
<i>We take him out.</i>

23
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,483
<i>We leave first thing
in the morning.</i>

24
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:19,573
<i>Any luck out there?</i>

25
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,001
Sorry, ma'am.

26
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:26,364
Nothing?
Not even rabbits?

27
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:28,523
Never seen anything
like it before.

28
00:01:28,524 --> 00:01:29,952
Nothing moving out there.

29
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,379
Think it was the fallout? Maybe it was
the radiation that killed the deer.

30
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,269
There'd still be dead animals,
carcasses, something.

31
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,114
I mean, it was weird.

32
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:37,373
Like all the game had vanished.

33
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,673
How far out
did you go?

34
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:42,378
15 miles out by Mill Pond
along the creek there.

35
00:01:42,498 --> 00:01:44,422
Guess we're going to have
to drive, huh, Jake?

36
00:01:44,423 --> 00:01:47,435
Yeah, but we have to be careful
about burning the gas rations

37
00:01:47,436 --> 00:01:48,438
in the middle of winter.

38
00:01:48,496 --> 00:01:50,424
We need everything we can
to run the generator.

39
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:51,987
We can live without
power for now.

40
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:53,715
Make fires to stay warm.

41
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:56,136
But we won't see Spring
if we don't eat.

42
00:01:56,213 --> 00:01:59,117
Stanley and I will have to use
whatever gas we can spare.

43
00:01:59,357 --> 00:02:01,314
and go out west,
Go out as far as it takes.

44
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:04,122
The rest of the hunting parties
will have to scrounge around locally.

45
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:06,142
Yeah, and Mimi's coming
with us.

46
00:02:07,068 --> 00:02:07,868
What?

47
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,113
Well, in case something happens to me,
I want to make sure she knows...

48
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,535
how to trap and shoot, okay?

49
00:02:16,676 --> 00:02:19,300
Look, the further you get
the hairier the roads are.

50
00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:20,824
With food being
as scarce as it is,

51
00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:22,598
there's bound to be
some trouble out there.

52
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,914
That sleeping bag's
rated to 40 below

53
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:28,077
and here's a wind-proof lighter for you.
You're going to need them both.

54
00:02:28,424 --> 00:02:29,509
Good hunting.

55
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,409
I'm guessing the good folks
of Jericho don't know

56
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,361
about all this stuff down here.
- They don't know about a lot of things.

57
00:02:37,517 --> 00:02:39,634
That'll be enough to get us
to the Old Man's place?

58
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:41,732
He is only about
two hours away.

59
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:43,734
I didn't realize
he was so close.

60
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,374
He chose the rally point.

61
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:47,534
Wanted it in his backyard.

62
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:49,116
How long as he been
watching you?

63
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,479
My guess...

64
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,006
since I stopped communications
a few days ago.

65
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:57,519
You worried about what we're
going to find out there?

66
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,719
- You're not.
- We can handle him.

67
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:03,037
It's you and me.
Let's get to work.

68
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:09,456
My grandmother
went fast than this

69
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,000
and she didn't
even have a car.

70
00:03:11,135 --> 00:03:13,219
We have to take it easy,
we only have half a tank.

71
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,974
Well, hopefully we'll make it
to Flint Springs. It's got...

72
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:16,402
Hopefully? What do you
mean "hopefully"?

73
00:03:16,403 --> 00:03:18,502
It's got a river.
It's prime white-tailed terrain.

74
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:19,659
I know, but...
This is crazy.

75
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,627
I told you that
I can't hunt.

76
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:22,862
Now you want me to kill Bambi.

77
00:03:22,863 --> 00:03:24,136
You're gonna have to
learn, all right?

78
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,142
Everyone's doing their part.
Bonnie's been out twice.

79
00:03:26,143 --> 00:03:27,425
Well, good for
frickin' Bonnie.

80
00:03:27,426 --> 00:03:28,775
Bonnie grew up on farm.

81
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:30,511
The closest I ever got
to the outdoors

82
00:03:30,512 --> 00:03:32,673
was the is the Ralph Lauren
section of Neiman Marcus.

83
00:03:32,706 --> 00:03:33,849
There you go,
bargain hunting.

84
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,064
Same thing, but with a gun.

85
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:37,080
Bargains? At Neimans?

86
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:38,456
Sometimes I forget

87
00:03:38,457 --> 00:03:40,636
that the biggest designer
in your closet is Wrangler.

88
00:03:42,314 --> 00:03:43,404
What are you
laughing at?

89
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,671
I've never seen you in a
domestic squabble before.

90
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:47,441
Knock it off.
This isn't squabbling.

91
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,901
Oh, my God.

92
00:03:56,197 --> 00:03:58,030
These dogs have tags.

93
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:04,644
Look at all this.

94
00:04:09,394 --> 00:04:10,628
Wall Drugs.

95
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:12,442
Wall, South Dakota.

96
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,962
Do you think that's where all
these people were coming from?

97
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:15,895
Think about it.

98
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,755
South Dakota without heat,
electricity, or...

99
00:04:19,314 --> 00:04:20,626
food being trucked in.

100
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:22,575
It's got to be even worse
in North Dakota,

101
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:23,481
Montana.

102
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:28,438
Oh, my God.

103
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:43,605
I read about this
at Blackjack.

104
00:04:44,369 --> 00:04:48,150
Mass migration, hundreds...
maybe thousands of people

105
00:04:48,883 --> 00:04:50,041
heading south.

106
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:53,706
Trying to outrun winter.

107
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,694
Should we be doing
that, too?

112
00:05:21,932 --> 00:05:23,109
How far is it?

113
00:05:25,154 --> 00:05:26,177
...60.

114
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,048
It's about 60 yards.

115
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:32,938
So 60 yard with almost
1.5 people per yard.

116
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:34,075
That's 90.

117
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:36,063
That's almost 100 people
just across.

118
00:05:36,078 --> 00:05:37,361
The way the ground
is trampled,

119
00:05:37,362 --> 00:05:39,290
you got to figure five
or tens times that amount

120
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,408
of people came through here.

121
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:43,535
Almost a thousand people?
Where are they going?

122
00:05:44,383 --> 00:05:46,216
South Texas, Mexico.

123
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,715
Anyplace warmer.

124
00:05:47,985 --> 00:05:49,895
It'd take weeks
to get there by foot.

125
00:05:49,904 --> 00:05:52,093
God know how many thousand
people have the same idea.

126
00:05:52,094 --> 00:05:53,734
Mexico's borders
could be closed.

127
00:05:53,735 --> 00:05:55,914
We don't even know if
there still is a Mexico.

128
00:05:57,112 --> 00:05:58,521
Maybe we should try
to catch on with them.

129
00:05:58,522 --> 00:06:02,399
We can barely feed ourselves,
let alone... hundreds more.

130
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:05,908
We got to keep going.

131
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,574
Let's go.

132
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,482
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

133
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:25,470
Hey. Glad you came down.

134
00:06:26,212 --> 00:06:27,081
Thank you.

135
00:06:27,696 --> 00:06:29,490
- What time did you, uh...
- Early...

136
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,918
late, I guess.

137
00:06:30,984 --> 00:06:33,039
I didn't want to wake you,
you looked so peaceful.

138
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,699
Peaceful? Really?

139
00:06:34,796 --> 00:06:37,487
Did you have another one of those
bad dreams? Keep on there.

140
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:39,723
I guess neither one of
us got much sleep.

141
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:43,365
All I could do was think about
all these people down here, you know.

142
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:46,076
And then I remembered about the
clothes we had in the attic.

143
00:06:46,077 --> 00:06:47,730
I thought that sweater
looked familiar.

144
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,711
Yeah, that woman was on
layover in Kansas City

145
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:50,714
when the bombs went off,

146
00:06:51,061 --> 00:06:53,400
Her husband and two kids
were waiting for her at home.

147
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:54,244
Where?

148
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:55,209
Denver.

149
00:06:57,061 --> 00:06:58,547
I lead these people here.

150
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:00,594
For better or worse
this is their home now.

151
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,735
It's on me to make sure
they're taken care of.

152
00:07:03,546 --> 00:07:05,186
Yeah, of course.

153
00:07:06,073 --> 00:07:07,443
What can I do to help, huh?

154
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:11,161
Talk to them,
follow your instincts.

155
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:13,399
The truth is...

156
00:07:13,495 --> 00:07:15,290
I'm winging this myself.

157
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:24,371
I'll be outside.
Here.

158
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,107
Should be back
before dark.

159
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,654
And if you're not?

160
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:39,868
Just tell me when I
should start to worry.

161
00:07:40,196 --> 00:07:41,566
This is the last time,

162
00:07:41,817 --> 00:07:42,646
okay?

163
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,942
After today

164
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:46,562
I'm here...

165
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:49,880
for good, huh?

166
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:52,262
Okay.

167
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,442
I'll hold you to that.

168
00:08:05,723 --> 00:08:06,533
Hi, honey.

169
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,375
How'd it go this morning?

170
00:08:08,597 --> 00:08:09,871
The whole thing
was a bust.

171
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:11,163
I'm sorry, hon.

172
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:12,253
Jake's out there now.

173
00:08:12,254 --> 00:08:13,411
Hopefully he and Stanley

174
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:14,916
will have better luck
than I did.

175
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:15,996
Is April here?

176
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:17,047
No, she's at
the clinic.

177
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:18,995
She promised me
she'd take a nap.

178
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,706
I hope it is warmer in that
clinic than it is in this house.

179
00:08:21,707 --> 00:08:23,712
I think this house has
dropped ten degrees

180
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:24,792
in the last hour.

181
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:27,339
Feels like a storm's
coming in.

182
00:08:28,564 --> 00:08:31,496
We'd better seal up these
windows the best was we can.

183
00:08:31,632 --> 00:08:33,754
Been going around collecting
old sheets and linens.

184
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:36,031
We'll shove them
underneath the doors.

185
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,613
Look what I found...

186
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,639
hidden in Jake's closet.

187
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:43,719
Lord knows how long
that's been there.

188
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,918
Well, at least he was
drinking the good stuff.

189
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:48,735
I used to hide the most awful
rotgut in the world

190
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,394
behind my mother's
china cabinet.

191
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:56,621
What do you think?

192
00:08:58,107 --> 00:08:59,477
On an empty stomach?

193
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,483
I'll get the glasses.

194
00:10:04,663 --> 00:10:06,506
Why would anyone destroy all this.

195
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:09,601
If they'd wanted it out of commission,
they could have just taken it.

196
00:10:09,616 --> 00:10:11,576
Be worth a fortune after the E.M.P.

197
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:13,839
Maybe there wasn't time,

198
00:10:13,903 --> 00:10:16,486
or maybe they didn't
care about this stuff.

199
00:10:23,866 --> 00:10:25,808
- How long?
- A couple of days...

200
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:26,960
Give or take.

201
00:10:27,457 --> 00:10:29,466
But we just heard
from him yesterday.

202
00:10:31,228 --> 00:10:32,800
We heard from someone.

203
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,234
Remote uplink.

204
00:10:34,604 --> 00:10:36,800
Somebody else using
his access codes.

205
00:10:36,823 --> 00:10:38,534
Who could have done this?

206
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:48,268
Wager for the first kill.

207
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:50,417
I'm in for a dozen eggs.

208
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:53,255
Two hours chopping wood.

209
00:10:53,602 --> 00:10:55,244
Tax return consultation.

210
00:10:57,096 --> 00:10:59,379
Oh, how about
foot massages for a week?

211
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:01,275
For me, not for him.

212
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:03,270
We'll talk.

213
00:11:03,293 --> 00:11:04,524
Stanley, stop.

214
00:11:10,334 --> 00:11:13,016
- What are they doing?
- They're blocking the whole road.

215
00:11:13,074 --> 00:11:14,831
More like staking it out.

216
00:11:16,073 --> 00:11:17,553
All right, turn around.

217
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,918
And... and go where?

218
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:22,773
I don't know. Just do it, all right?
Turn around. We'll find another road.

219
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:43,961
I see it. Damn it.

220
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:50,288
Why are they following us?

221
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,216
Stanley, gun it!

222
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,968
This should get us
back to the highway.

223
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:08,836
Then what?

224
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:11,094
We try to make it back home,
find the patrol.

225
00:12:11,422 --> 00:12:13,302
Maybe they'll give up by then
or run out of gas.

226
00:12:13,313 --> 00:12:14,984
Yeah, if we don't first.

227
00:12:15,424 --> 00:12:17,289
Stanley...
Stanley, hold on!

228
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:21,100
Doesn't look like
he put up much of a fight.

229
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:22,852
He was probably out
before he knew what hit him.

230
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:25,103
He must have trusted whoever did it.

231
00:12:25,438 --> 00:12:28,698
The thing is, whoever it was,

232
00:12:29,507 --> 00:12:31,669
they knew what
they were doing there,

233
00:12:31,938 --> 00:12:33,210
not over here.

234
00:12:33,349 --> 00:12:35,707
I mean, look at this.
It's a mess.

235
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,478
But the drives...
They look like they're still intact.

236
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:41,719
The old man had information
on the entire team...

237
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,728
Contact information,
backgrounds...

238
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,244
Last known whereabouts.

239
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:48,796
Let's find out where everybody is.

240
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:52,707
We can't outrun them.

241
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,694
- How far till Jericho?
- Too far.

242
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:57,720
Oh, God!

243
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:07,783
Stay down.

244
00:13:15,037 --> 00:13:16,181
Stay down.

245
00:13:35,172 --> 00:13:36,994
Give me that drive you got there.

246
00:13:37,813 --> 00:13:39,670
Must feel good to be back
in the saddle, huh?

247
00:13:40,218 --> 00:13:42,818
I wish we didn't have
to come out here in the first place.

248
00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:45,748
What, are you getting soft on me?
Too much domestic bliss?

249
00:13:45,749 --> 00:13:47,345
Not quite bliss.

250
00:13:48,683 --> 00:13:51,219
There.
There it is. We're in.

251
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,951
Thank you.

252
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,158
Karaoke bullfighter, right?

253
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,215
Excuse me?

254
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:22,730
At that bar in Barcelona.

255
00:14:22,753 --> 00:14:26,262
You decked a bullfighter who tried
to get you to stop singing that song...

256
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,799
"Stairway to Heaven"?

257
00:14:28,343 --> 00:14:29,903
Did Roger tell you that?

258
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:33,745
He also mentioned you like Oreo,
ice cream and white daisies.

259
00:14:35,178 --> 00:14:36,646
Don't be mad at him.

260
00:14:36,964 --> 00:14:39,235
He was trying to keep us entertained.

261
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:40,657
He kept talking and,

262
00:14:40,727 --> 00:14:42,275
somehow, we kept moving.

263
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:55,929
Hey. How you doing?

264
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:57,297
I'm a little tired.

265
00:14:57,298 --> 00:14:59,784
I'm going to head home
and get cleaned up.

266
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:03,381
Think I'll stay here for a
little longer if you don't mind.

267
00:15:03,797 --> 00:15:05,120
Yeah. Of course.

268
00:15:05,317 --> 00:15:06,343
You sure?

269
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,201
Yeah, I'm sure.

270
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:10,640
Looks like you owe
these folks a rematch.

271
00:15:11,357 --> 00:15:13,700
So, um...
I will see you when I see you.

272
00:15:30,173 --> 00:15:31,531
- To Jake.
- To Jake.

273
00:15:32,456 --> 00:15:35,346
Who would have thought,
six months ago, you'd be toasting him?

274
00:15:37,878 --> 00:15:40,788
Well, God knows Eric wouldn't
have hidden the bottle.

275
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:44,282
You and Jake have always
had much more in common

276
00:15:44,283 --> 00:15:46,027
than you wanted to admit.

277
00:15:48,038 --> 00:15:49,327
You going hunting

278
00:15:50,518 --> 00:15:51,963
all those weekends...

279
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:57,410
Why that kid got sit
in a deer stand for hours?

280
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:01,676
We wouldn't say a word
to each other. Just...

281
00:16:02,682 --> 00:16:04,370
be in the woods together.

282
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:11,137
I was always afraid that Jake
would forget about that.

283
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,478
You know, that he'd grow up only
remembering the bad times. That we were

284
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:19,647
That he wouldn't remember
that we had been close.

285
00:16:19,648 --> 00:16:24,046
That we were... buddies once.

286
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:29,961
He remembers...

287
00:16:34,354 --> 00:16:35,614
deep down.

288
00:16:38,107 --> 00:16:40,824
That's why you mean
so much to him.

289
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:45,691
Boy, that wind sounds awful.

290
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,015
I hope Stanley and Jake
are okay out there.

291
00:17:44,768 --> 00:17:45,829
What happened?

292
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,104
Jake, Stanley's not moving.

293
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,110
- What?
- Stanley's not moving.

294
00:17:58,438 --> 00:17:59,847
Oh, my God. Go hide.

295
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:02,732
- Go hide.
- No

296
00:18:03,017 --> 00:18:04,228
- Go on.
- No, No. Stanley...

297
00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:06,104
You'll be fine.
Go! Go hide!

298
00:19:24,843 --> 00:19:26,790
Come on.
Help me with Stanley.

299
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:29,704
I can't move.

300
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,446
Ritts, Woodworth, Pierce.

301
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,423
That's half the team.

302
00:19:37,862 --> 00:19:40,140
We're being hunted.
It's worse than that.

303
00:19:41,134 --> 00:19:42,724
It's Woodworth and his wife.

304
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,247
They were in Richmond.
That's his daughter.

305
00:19:45,672 --> 00:19:47,833
Anyone close to us
is in danger, too.

306
00:19:48,168 --> 00:19:49,371
No loose ends.

307
00:19:50,115 --> 00:19:51,349
Don't worry about your family.

308
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:53,467
We're not going to let
anything happen to them.

309
00:19:53,468 --> 00:19:55,291
It's just us, Chavez
and Cheung left.

310
00:19:55,382 --> 00:19:57,607
We'll get back out on the field,
stay in the weeds

311
00:19:57,608 --> 00:19:59,304
until we can connect
with the chief.

312
00:19:59,652 --> 00:20:00,733
Here. Look at this.

313
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,641
What is that?

314
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:08,860
If we are being hunted,

315
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,332
there... is the hunter.

316
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:22,316
Stanley, are you okay?

317
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:24,592
Can you get up?

318
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:34,309
Your leg?

319
00:20:35,284 --> 00:20:36,663
I think I busted my ankle.

320
00:20:44,503 --> 00:20:45,650
I'm okay.

321
00:20:46,606 --> 00:20:47,686
I'm just stuck.

322
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:51,544
- Let me try to get this off.
- Stanley, don't.

323
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:54,323
We can't do this ourselves.
You might make it worse.

324
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:57,716
Maybe you could dig me out.

325
00:20:58,314 --> 00:20:59,529
All right.

326
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,597
Help me get the shovels. They're in
the bed of the truck.

327
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,372
It's gone.

328
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:06,369
All right, get the jack.
The jack's back there.

329
00:21:07,055 --> 00:21:08,637
They took everything.

330
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,553
How was your bath?

331
00:21:21,177 --> 00:21:23,608
Lukewarm, then luke-cold,

332
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:25,024
then pretty much icy.

333
00:21:25,969 --> 00:21:28,188
- Look. Remember this?
- Oh, yeah.

334
00:21:28,189 --> 00:21:30,658
Times Square,
New Year's Eve, 2005.

335
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:32,066
Wasted.

336
00:21:32,413 --> 00:21:34,015
That hangover was epic.

337
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:41,209
Do you remember the last thing I said to
you the night before you left Jericho ?

338
00:21:41,296 --> 00:21:43,457
That I was selfish
and I didn't listen?

339
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,479
Something like that?

340
00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:48,337
You have no idea how that ate
at me while you were gone.

341
00:21:48,588 --> 00:21:51,579
- I just kept thinking that was
the last  - You were right.

342
00:21:55,001 --> 00:22:00,423
You know, today,
seeing you with those people...

343
00:22:01,715 --> 00:22:03,452
It was like you had found yourself.

344
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:07,676
I'm still just trying to figure
it out, you know?

345
00:22:09,817 --> 00:22:11,341
We're not these people anymore.

346
00:22:17,914 --> 00:22:20,103
But I'll tell you the one thing
that hasn't changed.

347
00:22:20,326 --> 00:22:21,792
The one constant.

348
00:22:22,351 --> 00:22:23,316
I love you.

349
00:22:24,282 --> 00:22:25,903
And it's going
to take a whole lot more

350
00:22:25,904 --> 00:22:27,948
than the end of the world
to change that.

351
00:22:39,335 --> 00:22:41,747
- How are your legs?
- I don't know I can't feel anything.

352
00:22:42,615 --> 00:22:43,695
The ground's
frozen solid.

353
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:44,967
It's sucking the heat
right out of you.

354
00:22:44,968 --> 00:22:46,261
Why can't we build a fire?

355
00:22:46,338 --> 00:22:47,688
You smell the fumes?

356
00:22:47,862 --> 00:22:49,618
You have to get back to town.

357
00:22:49,753 --> 00:22:51,199
All right. I'm going
to try and go.

358
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:53,904
No. You can't on that ankle.

359
00:22:54,276 --> 00:22:56,258
- I'll go.
- No. Those guys are still out there.

360
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:57,512
They went the other way.

361
00:22:57,608 --> 00:23:00,290
Jericho has a patrol
five miles out of town.

362
00:23:00,386 --> 00:23:01,872
We can't have come
more than ten.

363
00:23:01,968 --> 00:23:03,435
Jake, it's too dangerous.

364
00:23:03,485 --> 00:23:04,527
What are our options?

365
00:23:04,546 --> 00:23:05,916
With no bags, no fire?

366
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:08,386
All right, one of you goes
or we all die here.

367
00:23:12,746 --> 00:23:14,443
All right, fine, fine.

368
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:18,737
I threw a flashlight over there
somewhere. You might need it.

369
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,323
Listen...

370
00:23:23,557 --> 00:23:25,815
stay on the shoulder
the whole time, okay?

371
00:23:26,135 --> 00:23:28,643
If you see any headlights
or you hear any engines,

372
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,325
get low and hide,

373
00:23:31,421 --> 00:23:33,215
all right?
Now, you're gonna
want to head

374
00:23:33,732 --> 00:23:34,725
southeast.

375
00:23:35,863 --> 00:23:38,217
Stanley, that doesn't mean
anything to me.

376
00:23:41,072 --> 00:23:42,423
Stay on this road.

377
00:23:42,538 --> 00:23:44,159
Stay on this road
and then you make...

378
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:45,683
make your first left

379
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:47,747
Okay?
And you're gonna go about a mile

380
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:49,706
and then you're gonna make
your second right,

381
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,091
and you're gonna make another right
and then another left.

382
00:23:53,168 --> 00:23:56,225
And then once you get to the crossroads
of the highway, you're home free...

383
00:23:56,718 --> 00:23:59,322
You'll see a big sign pointing
to the way to Jericho, okay?

384
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:00,576
Got it?

385
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,930
Left, second right.

386
00:24:03,364 --> 00:24:04,695
Right, left,

387
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:05,534
Right.

388
00:24:10,263 --> 00:24:11,671
Mimi, I...

389
00:24:11,902 --> 00:24:12,964
Don't worry.

390
00:24:13,658 --> 00:24:14,623
Don't worry.

391
00:24:14,873 --> 00:24:15,992
I'll be careful.

392
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:31,974
<i>Here's what we're gonna do:</i>

393
00:24:31,975 --> 00:24:33,787
I know a place that's safe.

394
00:24:34,096 --> 00:24:36,411
We take Darcy and the kids
out of Jericho

395
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:39,111
and stash them before you and I
get back on the move.

396
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,089
I am not leaving them alone.

397
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,825
- I don't think you have a choice.
- No...

398
00:24:42,826 --> 00:24:45,063
See, because I've got leverage.

399
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:48,458
If they kill me, they will
never find the package.

400
00:24:48,843 --> 00:24:50,599
It's not you
they're gonna kill.

401
00:24:51,004 --> 00:24:53,724
It'll be Sam
or Darcy or me;

402
00:24:54,901 --> 00:24:57,409
anything they can use
to get to you.

403
00:25:01,983 --> 00:25:04,375
Anything they can
use to get to me.

404
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:09,843
The body.

405
00:25:10,682 --> 00:25:13,151
These... These, uh...

406
00:25:14,237 --> 00:25:17,806
...these half-smashed drives,

407
00:25:18,732 --> 00:25:20,700
<i>...this whole...</i>

408
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,436
this whole setup--

409
00:25:22,957 --> 00:25:24,693
If someone had wanted
to destroy all this,

410
00:25:24,694 --> 00:25:26,304
why leave the house
standing, huh?

411
00:25:26,516 --> 00:25:28,542
Why not just burn it all down?

412
00:25:29,207 --> 00:25:31,060
Someone wanted us
to see all this.

413
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:41,229
We're being played.

414
00:25:41,866 --> 00:25:43,708
Why would anyone go through
all that trouble?

415
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:44,981
I don't know,

416
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:46,717
but this is all too big now.

417
00:25:46,718 --> 00:25:48,173
There's too many angles
to cover.

418
00:25:48,174 --> 00:25:49,408
Too many unknowns.

419
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:52,282
I need to get home.

420
00:25:52,283 --> 00:25:53,575
- Robert, wait.
- What?

421
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,086
Let's think about this.

422
00:25:57,087 --> 00:25:58,919
What's the plan?
What are you going to do?

423
00:25:59,164 --> 00:26:02,675
You know, maybe the plan all
along was to get us out here.

424
00:26:03,601 --> 00:26:05,202
I gotta protect
my family, Sarah.

425
00:26:06,244 --> 00:26:07,575
And what about the package?

426
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:12,369
It'll need to be moved.

427
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:29,541
This isn't so bad, right?

428
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,113
Hey, we've been
through worse.

429
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,887
Remember the time we got stuck on
the roof of the...

430
00:26:32,888 --> 00:26:34,954
town hall in the middle
of a lightning storm, huh?

431
00:26:35,321 --> 00:26:37,250
We were so afraid the lightning
was going to...

432
00:26:37,616 --> 00:26:39,005
blow up the fireworks.

433
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,843
You squealed like a little girl
wanting to jump off that roof.

434
00:26:42,844 --> 00:26:43,731
That was you.

435
00:26:44,078 --> 00:26:45,621
Your voice hadn't changed yet.

436
00:26:46,277 --> 00:26:48,882
Please, I had you beat by,
like, six months.

437
00:26:51,633 --> 00:26:52,887
Drink some water.

438
00:26:54,122 --> 00:26:55,164
It's frozen right through.

439
00:26:55,588 --> 00:26:56,534
What?

440
00:27:02,524 --> 00:27:05,591
I saw an abandoned cabin about
a quarter mile up the road.

441
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,807
You need to get inside.

442
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:09,971
It'll hurt, but you can make it.

443
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,707
- Jake, I'm staying.
- Listen to me!

444
00:27:12,406 --> 00:27:15,725
There's no point in both of us
freezing to death out there.

445
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:18,329
- She's coming back.
- When?

446
00:27:19,661 --> 00:27:21,108
She's been gone for, like,
an hour.

447
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:23,066
It'll take her a little while to
reach the patrol,

448
00:27:23,067 --> 00:27:24,725
but when she does,
she'll find someone.

449
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,902
I know she'll find someone.

450
00:27:26,674 --> 00:27:28,391
Unless somebody finds her first.

451
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:29,895
Look,

452
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:32,285
it's gonna get dark soon,
you need to go.

453
00:27:40,816 --> 00:27:43,247
You wouldn't leave me
any more than I'm leaving you.

454
00:27:46,585 --> 00:27:48,591
Mimi's strong.
She'll find her way.

455
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,348
Wait...

456
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:04,103
he said keep going east.

457
00:28:05,531 --> 00:28:07,132
No... southeast.

458
00:28:08,815 --> 00:28:12,210
And... look for a sign.

459
00:28:25,274 --> 00:28:27,203
Oh, God, I hate this place!

460
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:00,778
Come on, man.

461
00:29:01,381 --> 00:29:02,442
You can't fall asleep.

462
00:29:02,538 --> 00:29:03,869
You got to stay up;
come on.

463
00:29:03,902 --> 00:29:05,195
You stopped shivering.
Come on.

464
00:29:05,196 --> 00:29:07,177
You got to talk to me--
come on, come on, buddy.

465
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,480
You gotta talk to me.

466
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,946
Talk to me, buddy.
Come on.

467
00:29:10,294 --> 00:29:11,491
I'm sorry.

468
00:29:11,586 --> 00:29:12,706
I'm really sorry.

469
00:29:12,707 --> 00:29:13,961
About what?

470
00:29:14,692 --> 00:29:16,197
Five years ago.

471
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:18,222
Sorry I left the way I did.

472
00:29:18,801 --> 00:29:20,344
Iit's okay. It doesn't matter.

473
00:29:20,595 --> 00:29:21,560
Doesn't matter.

474
00:29:21,561 --> 00:29:22,937
I was gonna call.

475
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:26,409
I was gonna call.

476
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:29,120
I know. Listen, I want you
to forget about it, okay?

477
00:29:29,121 --> 00:29:31,442
We never got to go backpacking
in Costa Rica.

478
00:29:31,443 --> 00:29:32,243
You know what?

479
00:29:32,782 --> 00:29:34,798
We're still gonna get to go
backpacking in Costa Rica, okay?

480
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,108
We're gonna...

481
00:29:36,301 --> 00:29:37,517
we're gonna learn how to surf.

482
00:29:37,518 --> 00:29:39,195
We're gonna sleep
on the beach.

483
00:29:39,426 --> 00:29:41,354
As soon as the planes
are up and running again,

484
00:29:41,355 --> 00:29:42,601
it's gonna be you and me.

485
00:29:42,736 --> 00:29:45,089
Hell, you can fly us
there yourself, huh?

486
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,722
Come on. Come on.
Tell me something good, man.

487
00:29:47,723 --> 00:29:50,786
I haven't talked to you in five years.
You've been gone for five years.

488
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,061
Tell me... Hey, tell me
about San Diego.

489
00:29:54,062 --> 00:29:55,166
How was it?

490
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,924
- Warm.
- Warm, right.

491
00:29:58,561 --> 00:30:00,375
Beaches, blondes, huh?

492
00:30:01,543 --> 00:30:03,144
What were you doing there?

493
00:30:03,222 --> 00:30:05,324
Flying, flying planes.

494
00:30:05,402 --> 00:30:08,083
Really?
That's cool, man.

495
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,649
Your grandfather
would've been psyched, huh?

496
00:30:10,758 --> 00:30:13,246
Did you have a girl there?
I know you had a girl.

497
00:30:13,594 --> 00:30:15,002
She's dead.

498
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:21,971
What do you mean?

499
00:30:22,762 --> 00:30:24,247
You don't know that.

500
00:30:24,248 --> 00:30:27,131
I mean, it all depends on where she was
when the bombs went off, right?

501
00:30:27,132 --> 00:30:28,717
I mean, she could
have made it, right?

502
00:30:28,736 --> 00:30:30,617
- Tell me what her name was.
- She's dead....

503
00:30:30,618 --> 00:30:31,871
It was my fault.

504
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,538
- It's not your fault.
- Let me lay down.

505
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:34,793
- Jake, no.
- Let me lay down.

506
00:30:34,794 --> 00:30:36,665
It wasn't your fault.
Come on... Come on...

507
00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:38,816
Come on, stay with me.
You gotta stay with me.

508
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,327
Come on, Jake.

509
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:44,568
Stay with me, Jake.
Come on, man.

510
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:48,773
Stay with me.

511
00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:09,039
Come on!

512
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:18,396
Okay, gotta keep moving.

513
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,016
Gotta keep moving.

514
00:31:45,229 --> 00:31:47,949
Please don't hurt me...
please don't hurt me.

515
00:31:47,988 --> 00:31:49,512
Please don't hurt me!

516
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,229
Please don't hurt me...

517
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,603
Mimi?

518
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:58,771
- It's Gail and Johnston Green, honey.
You're safe.  - Oh, thanks God!

519
00:31:58,974 --> 00:32:00,682
Come on, baby,
let's get out of here.

520
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,052
Come on.

521
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:11,582
Those are hideous.

522
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:13,588
Are those the sheets
from your old apartment?

523
00:32:13,935 --> 00:32:16,251
Because you can't expect
anyone to sleep on those.

524
00:32:16,709 --> 00:32:19,680
If anyone asks, we'll pretend
someone else donated them.

525
00:32:28,921 --> 00:32:29,943
Your dress.

526
00:32:32,528 --> 00:32:34,149
Guess I shouldn't be seeing this, huh?

527
00:32:35,615 --> 00:32:37,737
The day's sort of come and gone, so...

528
00:32:39,665 --> 00:32:40,765
It'll come again.

529
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:42,482
You think?

530
00:32:44,258 --> 00:32:45,377
I do.

531
00:32:46,843 --> 00:32:48,869
I tell you what, I've got
a pack of Ramen noodles

532
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,470
with your name on it,
what do you say?

533
00:32:50,894 --> 00:32:53,788
Great. I'll deliver this to the shelter
and come back and wash up.

534
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,756
Roger, wait.

535
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,803
I'll come with you.

536
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:17,035
It's Mom and Dad, honey!

537
00:33:17,671 --> 00:33:19,523
Stanley, you all right, sweetheart?

538
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:22,551
You need to go get in the truck
and get warm, pal.

539
00:33:22,552 --> 00:33:24,230
- Where's Mimi?
- I'm right here.

540
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:25,601
Stanley, I'm right here.

541
00:33:28,282 --> 00:33:30,192
Wake up. Wake up!

542
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:32,237
Wake up, Jake.

543
00:33:32,642 --> 00:33:33,645
Wake up.

544
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,050
Wake up. Oh, thank God.

545
00:33:35,051 --> 00:33:36,400
We're gonna help you, honey.

546
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:39,950
We saw the storm coming

547
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:42,420
and we started to worry
when you hadn't come back.

548
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:43,519
Sweetheart...

549
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:47,108
Honey,

550
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:49,326
we're not gonna be able
to get this truck off of him.

551
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,216
I need you to take
these guys back to town

552
00:33:51,217 --> 00:33:52,725
and get me some help out here.

553
00:33:52,726 --> 00:33:55,383
You signal when you're coming back
so I know it's you, all right?

554
00:33:55,384 --> 00:33:57,794
- I'll flash the lights.
- All right, go, go, go!

555
00:33:59,972 --> 00:34:01,400
Jake, look at me, son.

556
00:34:01,401 --> 00:34:02,403
Lookie here.

557
00:34:02,711 --> 00:34:04,930
You're gonna make it, son...
I know you.

558
00:34:05,914 --> 00:34:08,615
I know what you're made of.
You're gonna be all right.

559
00:34:09,155 --> 00:34:11,759
You're gonna make it.
Stay with me now.

560
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,904
Robert, please,
the kids are sleeping.

561
00:34:28,463 --> 00:34:31,029
- I'm sorry.
- What on earth are you doing?

562
00:34:31,372 --> 00:34:32,896
Oh, I'm sorry.

563
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,521
Jake, you'll be home real soon,

564
00:34:47,927 --> 00:34:50,010
but you got to stay
with me now. Come on.

565
00:34:52,373 --> 00:34:54,216
Leave me here.
Leave me alone.

566
00:34:54,486 --> 00:34:56,145
Now, I'm not going anywhere.

567
00:34:56,705 --> 00:34:58,267
But you got to hang on.

568
00:34:58,576 --> 00:35:00,467
Now, they'll be here soon, son.

569
00:35:02,512 --> 00:35:03,524
Dad...

570
00:35:04,141 --> 00:35:05,386
I'm sorry.

571
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:08,353
Oh, son, you got nothing
to be sorry about.

572
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,125
Open your eyes, Jake.
Come on, now.

573
00:35:15,974 --> 00:35:18,116
Look at me.
Look at me, Jake.

574
00:35:20,392 --> 00:35:21,878
I can see her.

575
00:35:23,923 --> 00:35:25,061
See who?

576
00:35:26,662 --> 00:35:28,032
The girl.

577
00:35:30,327 --> 00:35:31,967
What... girl?

578
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,704
Jake, I think you're hallucinating, son.

579
00:35:33,705 --> 00:35:34,727
No, listen to me.

580
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,836
When I was in Iraq...

581
00:35:41,248 --> 00:35:42,849
... there was a girl.

582
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,901
She couldn't have been more than...

583
00:35:47,592 --> 00:35:48,749
10 or 12...

584
00:35:49,656 --> 00:35:51,007
Don't talk now, son.

585
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:52,222
You save your energy.

586
00:35:52,223 --> 00:35:53,843
We'll talk when we get... home.

587
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:56,659
I killed her, Dad.

588
00:36:02,544 --> 00:36:04,241
I killed a little girl.

589
00:36:27,636 --> 00:36:28,967
Hurry up!

590
00:36:42,008 --> 00:36:43,494
Open your eyes, Jake.

591
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:44,864
Open your eyes.

592
00:36:46,156 --> 00:36:47,930
All right, everyone on three...

593
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:48,934
One,

594
00:36:49,262 --> 00:36:50,747
two, three!

595
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,190
All right, he's free.

596
00:36:57,692 --> 00:36:58,984
Let's get the board in here.

597
00:36:59,988 --> 00:37:01,821
One, two, three.

598
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,763
You were right.

599
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:16,695
I need to get my family
as far away from me as possible.

600
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,106
I've been thinking, and...

601
00:37:19,897 --> 00:37:21,557
There's no other choice.

602
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,817
You're doing the right thing.

603
00:37:26,264 --> 00:37:27,344
Listen.

604
00:37:29,274 --> 00:37:30,663
After they're safe,

605
00:37:31,184 --> 00:37:33,036
you and me need
to get back in the field.

606
00:37:33,537 --> 00:37:35,466
That's half our team gone, Sarah,

607
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:37,681
and whoever did that
did it for a reason.

608
00:37:40,671 --> 00:37:42,350
How are you gonna tell Darcy?

609
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:47,211
I'll tell her after I've moved them.

610
00:37:48,445 --> 00:37:51,108
She'll never agree if she knows
I won't be staying with them.

611
00:38:01,835 --> 00:38:03,764
He's better off here
than the med center.

612
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:07,140
We're still on emergency power,
and it's... it's warmer here.

613
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,034
Here, honey.

614
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:11,921
What about his injuries?

615
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,835
Well, the cut on his head
isn't very deep,

616
00:38:13,836 --> 00:38:15,972
and neither one
of his legs are broken.

617
00:38:16,705 --> 00:38:17,920
He's very lucky.

618
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,232
I'm freezing.

619
00:38:19,657 --> 00:38:21,470
I'm gonna go get you
some more blankets.

620
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,476
You're still hypothermic.

621
00:38:23,477 --> 00:38:26,486
It's just gonna take a few hours
for your body to stabilize.

622
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:30,325
- Can we have a minute?
- Oh, sure.

623
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:47,052
Dad...

624
00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:53,245
What I told you out there...

625
00:38:56,139 --> 00:38:57,721
please forget it.

626
00:38:59,419 --> 00:39:00,576
Please.

627
00:39:04,338 --> 00:39:05,766
Afraid I can't do that.

628
00:39:18,129 --> 00:39:20,483
I've seen a lot of things
in my time, Jake.

629
00:39:22,837 --> 00:39:24,052
I've been to war.

630
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:28,740
I know what war can do.
I know what men can do... Terrible...

631
00:39:30,149 --> 00:39:31,635
... terrible things.

632
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:35,893
I know what I did.

633
00:39:38,555 --> 00:39:40,060
You can talk to me.

634
00:40:05,526 --> 00:40:06,934
When you're ready, son.

635
00:40:10,273 --> 00:40:11,488
When you're ready.

636
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:30,896
You okay?

637
00:40:39,192 --> 00:40:40,465
How's the sprain?

638
00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:45,038
I think it'd be better with painkillers,
but I'm not gonna complain.

639
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:49,066
You know, for a while there, I didn't
think I'd ever feel anything again.

640
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,464
When I was out there,

641
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:55,317
just for a moment,

642
00:40:56,378 --> 00:40:58,153
I didn't think
I was gonna make it.

643
00:40:59,196 --> 00:41:01,859
And I stopped... to rest.

644
00:41:02,746 --> 00:41:05,235
And then I just didn't
even want to move.

645
00:41:08,823 --> 00:41:10,000
But you did.

646
00:41:11,505 --> 00:41:12,817
You did make it.

647
00:41:14,283 --> 00:41:15,846
And I knew you would.

648
00:41:22,501 --> 00:41:24,373
Your lips are still cold.

649
00:41:26,668 --> 00:41:28,520
Maybe you can warm them.

650
00:41:33,112 --> 00:41:35,369
That's the worst line
I've ever heard.

651
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,800
I know. I've got others.

652
00:41:39,035 --> 00:41:40,636
- Shut up.
- Okay.

653
00:41:51,465 --> 00:41:52,798
Tomorrow morning...

654
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:56,033
we're leaving.

655
00:41:57,342 --> 00:41:59,170
We're leaving?
For... for where?

656
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,318
I don't know yet.

657
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,552
You don't know?

658
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,504
Darcy, when I came
to get you in DC...

659
00:42:13,616 --> 00:42:15,283
I told you it wasn't safe,

660
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,506
but I couldn't tell you why.

661
00:42:23,038 --> 00:42:24,236
I'm going for a walk.

662
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:39,396
I have something
in my possession.

663
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,426
And there's people
out there that want it,

664
00:42:43,981 --> 00:42:46,154
that will stop at nothing to get it.

665
00:42:48,471 --> 00:42:50,071
And that puts you,
me and the kids

666
00:42:50,466 --> 00:42:51,592
in danger here.

667
00:42:57,746 --> 00:42:59,850
Okay, so th... then we go.

668
00:43:01,193 --> 00:43:02,398
<i>I trust you.</i>

669
00:43:08,107 --> 00:43:09,272
<i>Robert, do y...</i>

670
00:43:10,725 --> 00:43:11,792
Do you trust me?

671
00:43:14,785 --> 00:43:17,068
- You're late.
- You're impatient.

672
00:43:22,361 --> 00:43:23,852
Then listen to me.

673
00:43:24,731 --> 00:43:26,895
Okay, Sarah is not on our side.

674
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,781
Now... whatever's...

675
00:43:29,284 --> 00:43:30,608
gone on between the two of you,

676
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:32,929
I'm telling you, Robert,
she's not here to help us.

677
00:43:36,455 --> 00:43:37,937
Have you located the package?

678
00:43:38,648 --> 00:43:39,653
Soon.

679
00:43:41,096 --> 00:43:43,033
Hawkins is starting to put
the pieces together.

680
00:43:43,034 --> 00:43:45,562
- He needs to be eliminated.
- I know.

681
00:43:45,778 --> 00:43:48,683
We've already eliminated the other
three targets without incident.

682
00:43:48,684 --> 00:43:50,363
Why are you stalling on this one?

683
00:44:01,356 --> 00:44:03,124
Because this one is different.
