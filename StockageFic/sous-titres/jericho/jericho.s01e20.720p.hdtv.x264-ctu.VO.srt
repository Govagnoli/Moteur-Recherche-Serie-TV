00:00:00,132 --> 00:00:01,413
<i>Previously on</i> Jericho

2
00:00:01,712 --> 00:00:02,962
We're the United States Marines

3
00:00:03,062 --> 00:00:05,029
and we're here to help.
- Lance Corporal Mullen.

4
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,938
- Jake.
- Maggie.

5
00:00:07,626 --> 00:00:10,755
They've got somebody on the edge of town
pretending to be their headquarters.

6
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:12,504
- Is any of this real?
- The gun's real.

7
00:00:12,604 --> 00:00:13,972
Hands up!
Get 'em up!

8
00:00:14,574 --> 00:00:15,584
You're a smart girl.

9
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:17,895
You need to get out before
these guys get you killed.

10
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:18,999
And go where?

11
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:20,657
Justin, you SOB.

12
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,711
How the hell did you lose an election?

13
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:25,277
The question is how did you get
to be in charge of New Bern?

14
00:00:25,377 --> 00:00:26,829
They get tired of you being sheriff?

15
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:29,435
No, I'm still sheriff.
Just got a little more authority.

16
00:00:29,535 --> 00:00:31,484
This thing work?
We get power from it?

17
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:32,712
Probably sometime tomorrow.

18
00:00:32,812 --> 00:00:34,292
Let's get it up as fast as we can.

19
00:00:34,392 --> 00:00:35,656
Can we buy some more
of these things?

20
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:38,266
You got one of the only salt
mines around for 400 miles.

21
00:00:38,391 --> 00:00:39,409
We're gonna need food.

22
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:41,411
Ten wind turbines
for let's say...

23
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:42,917
ten percent of your spring crop.

24
00:00:43,017 --> 00:00:44,730
Okay, we'll give you the food.

25
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,087
We're gonna need ten Jericho men
to help us build it.

26
00:00:47,462 --> 00:00:51,327
What you are about to do
means this town's survival.

27
00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:52,578
All right, let's move out.

28
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:54,875
Anything happens to any of them...

29
00:00:54,984 --> 00:00:56,424
you're the first one I come for.

30
00:00:57,027 --> 00:00:58,915
I didn't know you guys
were coming back today.

31
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:00,468
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.

32
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:02,940
- Where's my brother?
- He hasn't been seen for a few days.

33
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:06,184
<i>You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china.

34
00:01:06,575 --> 00:01:08,609
It's a full inventory of Jericho.

35
00:01:08,742 --> 00:01:10,510
They sliceit up like they own it.

36
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,996
They're making mortar rounds.

37
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:13,531
They're getting ready for war.

38
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:14,635
Hold it!

39
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:37,465
Come on.

40
00:01:43,577 --> 00:01:44,751
This doesn't look good.

41
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:46,753
It could turn into a
full-blown riot.

42
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:49,316
As our guys show up,
you keep them back out of sight.

43
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:51,672
I don't want those New Bern
guys getting trigger-happy.

44
00:01:51,808 --> 00:01:53,831
This salt mine is
private property!

45
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:56,522
You have 30 seconds to
get the hell out of here!

46
00:02:31,482 --> 00:02:32,968
What did I tell you, Ted?

47
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:34,079
Sorry.

48
00:02:35,612 --> 00:02:36,628
I knew it was you.

49
00:02:36,664 --> 00:02:38,773
Yeah, but if it wasn't me...

50
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:40,979
you just gave up my name.

51
00:02:49,973 --> 00:02:52,176
I want you to tell me
who your friend is

52
00:02:52,276 --> 00:02:53,854
and where I can find him.

53
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:00,286
Things are gonna get
very bad for you

54
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:02,899
and your brother,
vxyou don't help us, Jake.

55
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:05,814
Why would I want to help you?

56
00:03:05,914 --> 00:03:07,381
This is what I know...

57
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:10,715
is that you, your friend
and your brother

58
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,795
were caught attempting to sabotage
this town's sole means of manufacture.

59
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:15,461
Manufacturing weapons. You were man...

60
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:17,237
So I'm gonna
repeat the question:

61
00:03:17,337 --> 00:03:19,571
Where is your friend?

62
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,810
Why don't you tell me what
vvhappened to Heather Lisinski?

63
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:31,950
Take him back.

64
00:03:32,091 --> 00:03:33,092
Let's go, boy.

65
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:35,611
Word's gonna get back.

66
00:03:35,736 --> 00:03:37,986
It's gonna get back to Jericho
about what you're doing,

67
00:03:38,086 --> 00:03:40,476
and there's nothing you
can do to stop it!

68
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:08,205
- You okay?
- Yeah.

69
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,445
- Looks like they went easy on you.
- Yeah, for now.

70
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,714
They haven't found Hawkins yet.

71
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:19,056
We're gonna get out of here.

72
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:28,337
How many people have to die
before you don't care anymore?

73
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:31,865
April's death was not your fault.

74
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:36,480
I can't even be sure Heather's dead
with the lies they're spreading.

75
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:39,643
I've seen, Jake.

76
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:44,618
I don't think I can go back.

77
00:04:46,305 --> 00:04:47,958
Staying here and getting
yourself killed

78
00:04:48,058 --> 00:04:50,891
isn't going to make you
feel any better, trust me.

79
00:04:57,095 --> 00:04:59,693
Remember the time
I was supposed to...

80
00:05:00,522 --> 00:05:02,853
wake you up for that meteor shower?

81
00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:08,261
Yeah, it was supposed
to be this...

82
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,140
once-in-a-lifetime thing.

83
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,440
Anyway...

84
00:05:13,894 --> 00:05:15,286
you were so pissed at me,

85
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:18,220
so I finally gave up
and let you sleep.

86
00:05:19,377 --> 00:05:20,926
I'm not giving up this time.

87
00:05:32,644 --> 00:05:34,350
I should arrest you right here!

88
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,994
It's not his fault. We had to deal
with him in New Bern.

89
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:38,496
Gray, what the hell is this?

90
00:05:38,668 --> 00:05:39,669
There's no deal!

91
00:05:39,785 --> 00:05:41,212
I'm not giving away anything!

92
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:44,014
Listen, we'll think of something.
Right now we need to stand down.

93
00:05:44,114 --> 00:05:45,724
No, we're not leaving
without our salt.

94
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:48,687
- It's not worth people getting hurt.
- She's right.

95
00:05:49,477 --> 00:05:51,410
- All right, everybody...
- What are you doing?

96
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,392
Dale, I'm not going to
let people get killed.

97
00:05:53,492 --> 00:05:55,439
- This was your idea.
- This is over!

98
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:56,639
Get your guys out of here!

99
00:05:56,842 --> 00:05:58,720
Hey! Gray, come on!

104
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,950
How many more are there?

105
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,703
I'm not sure.
Six, maybe seven.

106
00:06:21,803 --> 00:06:23,766
We need gurneys.
What happened?

107
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:25,140
Some guys from New Bern showed up

108
00:06:25,203 --> 00:06:27,140
trying to steal our salt.
There was a shootout.

109
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,270
Oh, my God!
Okay, Harry...

110
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,601
Harry, we're gonna get you
cleaned up, buddy, okay?

111
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:33,764
All right, you need me
to look at your arm?

112
00:06:33,874 --> 00:06:35,376
No, it's okay. I can wait.

113
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:38,363
We shouldn't be patching
those guys up.

114
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,533
We should be arresting them.
They opened fire on us!

115
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:42,187
We don't know who shot first, all right?

116
00:06:42,188 --> 00:06:43,379
I'll get to an investigation.

117
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:45,831
Right now we need to make
sure people don't die.

118
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,888
Oh, my God.

119
00:06:48,295 --> 00:06:50,376
Get him to Kenchy... now.

120
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,164
Could we get some ice, please?
She twisted her ankle.

121
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,230
I'm fine.

122
00:06:59,144 --> 00:07:00,176
Hang on.

123
00:07:04,547 --> 00:07:05,580
Hold on, Harry.

124
00:07:05,955 --> 00:07:08,631
Hey, Mrs. Carmichael.
Is he gonna be all right?

125
00:07:09,344 --> 00:07:11,034
No, he's not gonna be all right!

126
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:12,353
I didn't want this to happen.

127
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:14,100
Why should we expect
anything different?

128
00:07:14,171 --> 00:07:18,126
As long as you and your boyfriend are
all set, the rest of us can go to hell!

129
00:07:18,658 --> 00:07:20,755
Wouldn't your father be proud?

130
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:23,007
What is that supposed to mean?

131
00:07:23,195 --> 00:07:25,135
Okay, come on.
She's just nervous.

132
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,254
Caroline, take a look at
her ankle, will ya?

133
00:07:27,354 --> 00:07:28,571
Don't worry about it.

134
00:07:28,696 --> 00:07:30,437
Gail, we heard about the shooting.

135
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:32,422
I brought the antiseptic
I've been working on.

136
00:07:32,477 --> 00:07:33,493
What can we do to help?

137
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:35,636
Look, I need charts on
everybody who's checked in.

138
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:37,665
Annie, show her how to
fill one out, will ya?

139
00:07:37,734 --> 00:07:39,952
- What's all this gonna mean for Eric?
- I don't know.

140
00:07:39,963 --> 00:07:41,553
But haven't we heard anything?

141
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:42,964
I told you I don't know.

142
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:44,819
Johnston's working on it.

143
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:48,347
Now what I could use is a roll
of gauze and some bandages.

144
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:50,446
They're on the cart
next to the ultrasound.

145
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:52,098
I just don't know
what that looks like.

146
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,989
Never mind. I'll do it myself.

147
00:07:56,446 --> 00:07:58,339
What the hell did you think
was gonna happen?!

148
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,078
You didn't have to bring
rangers in there.

149
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,629
I was protec...
What?!

150
00:08:04,164 --> 00:08:06,417
I'm afraid we've had
our first fatality.

151
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:09,820
One of your guys
from New Bern...

152
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,975
Dawson.
I didn't get the first name.

153
00:08:13,656 --> 00:08:15,002
Jim Dawson.

154
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:19,642
You have got to let me
go back to New Bern

155
00:08:19,742 --> 00:08:22,067
and tell them that you support
this salt mine deal.

156
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,144
No, that's not happening.

157
00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:25,479
If they so much as think that
you fired the first shot...

158
00:08:25,498 --> 00:08:27,289
- The who fi... What?
- Come on, Gray.

159
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,803
We need to work together
while we still can.

160
00:08:33,676 --> 00:08:35,162
Things are bad in New Bern.

161
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,119
And when they find out
that six of us came here

162
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,137
and only five are coming back...

163
00:08:41,424 --> 00:08:43,004
What are you saying, Russell?

164
00:08:44,663 --> 00:08:45,836
You got people there.

165
00:08:48,073 --> 00:08:49,513
You should bring 'em home.

166
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,914
Eric's still there.

167
00:08:58,614 --> 00:09:00,648
Johnston, you need
to know something.

168
00:09:01,352 --> 00:09:03,308
vEric hasn't been seen
for a few days.

169
00:09:04,454 --> 00:09:06,749
And yesterday, Jake went
back there to try and find him.

170
00:09:06,784 --> 00:09:08,260
You're telling me this now?

171
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:12,057
All right, come on. We leave now,
we can get there before dawn.

172
00:09:12,077 --> 00:09:14,207
- No, no, no. I'm not authori...
- Did you hear him?

173
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,435
Constantino wants a bigger fight.

174
00:09:16,732 --> 00:09:19,313
He's not gonna have
my sons as human shields.

175
00:09:21,664 --> 00:09:22,916
Let's go!

176
00:09:49,403 --> 00:09:50,592
Maggie?

177
00:09:57,414 --> 00:09:59,276
Of all the jail cells, right?

178
00:10:01,532 --> 00:10:03,988
Hardly recognize you
without your wardrobe.

179
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,524
What happened?
You guys get caught?

180
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,570
Kind of hard to pull that
voff without the tank.

181
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:15,190
We...

182
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:18,038
pretty much split up after Jericho.

183
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:22,094
I came to New Bern with
a couple of the guys,

184
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:25,102
but we got turned away at the border
a few weeks ago.

185
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,567
I was dumb enough to try
and sneak back in.

186
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:30,273
Why? This place is hell.

187
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:33,715
- It's worse out there.
- Really? That's hard to imagine.

188
00:10:36,184 --> 00:10:39,172
I heard you two got dragged
in front of the Town Hall.

189
00:10:39,825 --> 00:10:42,391
I don't want to scare you, Jake,
but you gotta get out of here.

190
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,686
It isn't exactly easy.

191
00:10:43,795 --> 00:10:46,189
You could do it if you
got someone outside.

192
00:10:47,676 --> 00:10:48,677
Why?
Do you?

193
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:51,118
Know someone outside?
No.

194
00:10:52,996 --> 00:10:54,842
I'm just trying to help.

195
00:10:55,992 --> 00:10:57,123
Last time you tried to help,

196
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,340
you nearly wiped out
my town's supplies.

197
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:01,829
- I was trying to survive.
- Yeah, so were we.

198
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:03,863
Look, I'm not saying it was right.

199
00:11:05,443 --> 00:11:08,044
We had something people
wanted and we used it.

200
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,515
That's how it works.

201
00:11:11,267 --> 00:11:13,677
You think you're helpless in here?
You're not.

202
00:11:13,703 --> 00:11:15,150
Not if you have something they want.

203
00:11:15,171 --> 00:11:17,151
What makes you think
I have something they want?

204
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:20,103
I don't think they're beating
the two of you up for fun.

205
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,664
Even if I did have something,
I wouldn't give it to them.

206
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,247
You're right. You shouldn't.

207
00:11:25,714 --> 00:11:26,730
But I could.

208
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:29,172
Yeah, right.
No, thanks.

209
00:11:29,344 --> 00:11:32,376
Listen, if you talk... they're going
to throw you back in your cell.

210
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,305
There's no way they're letting
either of you out of here.

211
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:40,981
But if I had the information,
I could trade it for my freedom.

212
00:11:41,388 --> 00:11:42,401
And I can go get help.

213
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,517
What... give myself up
to get you out?

214
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:46,644
So I can get all three of us out.

215
00:11:47,478 --> 00:11:49,512
And you can take me
back to Jericho.

216
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:53,861
I can't go anywhere without you.

217
00:12:03,574 --> 00:12:04,607
Let's go.

218
00:12:05,248 --> 00:12:06,622
What are you doing?
Get up!

219
00:12:06,722 --> 00:12:08,361
Hey, where are you taking him?

220
00:12:08,507 --> 00:12:10,900
He's already told you
everything he knows!

221
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,095
How are things here?

222
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,863
Harry's going to be okay, but...

223
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:22,675
I'm worried about the staff.

224
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,196
Everybody's exhausted.

225
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,767
You sure you're okay to drive?

226
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:29,233
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

227
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:33,766
Better hit the road.

228
00:12:37,568 --> 00:12:38,710
Be careful.

229
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:44,862
If I lose all three of you...
I swear to God...

230
00:12:48,914 --> 00:12:50,541
I'm going to bring them home.

231
00:12:52,849 --> 00:12:54,241
You get some sleep.

232
00:13:02,606 --> 00:13:03,638
Got to go.

233
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,470
What's going on?

234
00:13:24,752 --> 00:13:26,504
What are you doing to him?

235
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:50,783
Jake, just give me a chance, please.
We can end this.

236
00:14:05,598 --> 00:14:07,679
His name is Robert Hawkins.

237
00:14:10,213 --> 00:14:12,375
He said he's probably in a hunting cabin

238
00:14:12,475 --> 00:14:14,110
owned by a guy named Ted Lewis.

239
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,326
He works at the factory.

240
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:17,814
Find out where it is.

241
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:19,018
Get over there.

242
00:14:20,544 --> 00:14:22,359
You're supposed to
take me with you.

243
00:14:22,468 --> 00:14:23,469
What?

244
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:26,254
That's... the deal I made
with Constantino.

245
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:28,261
I go with you, and as soon as
you see the guy's there,

246
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:30,197
you drop me off at the checkpoint.

247
00:14:30,854 --> 00:14:32,700
Just talk to Constantino.

248
00:14:33,036 --> 00:14:35,164
This is... he was supposed
to be here!

249
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:37,581
Take her with you.

250
00:14:37,804 --> 00:14:39,959
If he's not there, kill her.

251
00:15:08,726 --> 00:15:10,462
This is Johnston Green
from Jericho.

252
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:12,879
- We need talk to the sheriff.
- He's up at the cabin.

253
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:14,822
We have orders
he's not to be interrupted.

254
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,067
He'll want to be
interrupted for this.

255
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:35,070
It's not exactly Mayberry, is it?

256
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:37,189
Not since Ravenwood.

257
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:39,805
How are you with a rifle?

258
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,879
I hunted jackrabbits before.

259
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:49,260
Well, I've never shot a person,
if that's what you're asking.

260
00:15:57,819 --> 00:15:59,474
We need to go back to the factory.

261
00:15:59,988 --> 00:16:01,246
We need mortars.

262
00:16:01,825 --> 00:16:03,083
Well, for what?

263
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:04,778
We can't launch them
over that fence.

264
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,692
We're not going
to launch them from here.

265
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,385
Phil.

266
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,809
Nice spread you got here.

267
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:30,979
I always wanted you
to see this place.

268
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:32,209
Well, I just...

269
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,163
wish it were under
better circumstances.

270
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:38,501
I just found out Eric's been
missing a couple of days.

271
00:16:39,842 --> 00:16:41,432
I'd like a little update on that.

272
00:16:41,812 --> 00:16:44,014
And there was an incident
at the salt mine.

273
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:46,250
Some of our people got hurt.

274
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:49,626
Let's take a walk.

275
00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:04,188
<i>I'll go around back.</i>

276
00:17:04,304 --> 00:17:05,644
<i>I got the front.
You watch her.</i>

277
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,052
<i>Let's go.</i>

278
00:17:12,454 --> 00:17:14,060
You better hope he's home.

279
00:17:20,141 --> 00:17:22,840
This mine deal,
this is your idea?

280
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:25,439
I thought it could help the town,
create a partnership.

281
00:17:25,482 --> 00:17:27,965
- That didn't quite work out, did it?
- It was...

282
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:30,134
mishandled all the way around.

283
00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:32,324
We were hoping we could
reach some agreement.

284
00:17:32,363 --> 00:17:34,543
It's a little late for that.
You opened fire on our citizens.

285
00:17:34,544 --> 00:17:36,050
- We don't know who shot first.
- Come on, Phil.

286
00:17:36,051 --> 00:17:38,352
A bunch of guys shows up with guns
in the middle of the night

287
00:17:38,353 --> 00:17:40,222
trying to take our salt.
What would you have done?

288
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:42,517
Jericho's continuous acts of
aggression against this town

289
00:17:42,518 --> 00:17:44,331
are unjustifiable.
- What "continuous acts"?

290
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,723
We're neighbors, for God's sake.

291
00:17:45,724 --> 00:17:46,998
I didn't hear much talk of neighbors

292
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,968
when you sent Ravenwood
straight to our door.

293
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:51,392
We almost blew everything
to hell and gone

294
00:17:51,393 --> 00:17:53,859
trying to defend ourselves
against those mercenaries.

295
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:56,110
We had no idea where
they were headed next.

296
00:17:56,111 --> 00:17:57,417
You couldn't try and warn us?

297
00:17:57,545 --> 00:18:00,315
You couldn't help us when they were
raiding what little we had left,

298
00:18:00,316 --> 00:18:01,910
shooting whoever got in their way?

299
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:04,444
My deputies, my friends?

300
00:18:04,565 --> 00:18:07,347
Then I find both of your sons.

301
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,625
Both of them in my factory

302
00:18:09,663 --> 00:18:12,074
trying to destroy the last form
of capital this town's got.

303
00:18:12,075 --> 00:18:13,093
Slow down.

304
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:17,260
Jake was apprehended yesterday,
attempting to sabotage my factory.

305
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,209
That makes no sense.

306
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,134
The factory's producing wind turbines.

307
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,171
Your sons are pretty
bent on the idea.

308
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:27,870
I caught Eric the day before
trying to do the same thing.

309
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:29,415
We're holding both of them.

310
00:18:38,892 --> 00:18:40,514
Now, you listen to me.

311
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:43,643
I don't care what you think
we've done to you,

312
00:18:44,272 --> 00:18:46,374
but if any harm comes
to either of those boys,

313
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,980
this is not going to end well.

314
00:18:48,164 --> 00:18:50,414
There's been little chance
of this ending well for some time.

315
00:18:50,415 --> 00:18:52,670
I want to see my boys. Now.

316
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,361
What the hell's
taking them so long?

317
00:19:47,901 --> 00:19:48,969
Who are you?

318
00:19:49,457 --> 00:19:51,212
- Don't shoot!
- Who are you?

319
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:52,934
I'm with Jake.
I'm with Jake.

320
00:19:52,935 --> 00:19:55,215
- Columbus! Columbus!
- What you say?

321
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,931
Jake said if I said Columbus
you'd know he sent me. I was...

322
00:19:57,932 --> 00:19:59,057
I was with him in prison.

323
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:01,348
He sent me to help you.
He sent me to help you!

324
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:02,523
Columbus, Columbus.

325
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,354
I got it.

326
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:10,089
How is Jake doing?

327
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:12,920
He's okay.

328
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:14,974
Yeah?

329
00:20:26,003 --> 00:20:27,052
That's Ted.

330
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,641
He's with me.

331
00:20:30,711 --> 00:20:32,847
I'm Maggie.
Jake sent me.

332
00:20:33,012 --> 00:20:34,039
Where are the cops?

333
00:20:36,341 --> 00:20:37,665
They've been dealt with.

334
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:42,350
You don't want to go in there.

335
00:20:46,043 --> 00:20:47,433
Here, this is everything.

336
00:20:53,492 --> 00:20:54,800
So, what's the plan?

337
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,582
Plan?

338
00:20:58,095 --> 00:21:00,761
There's going to be
an explosion in town.

339
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:02,707
Hopefully, it'll cause enough chaos

340
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,140
that we can somehow
get Jake and Eric out of there.

341
00:21:08,505 --> 00:21:10,028
I think I can help you do that.

342
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,355
I have an in with Constantino.

343
00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:36,447
Come on. Get up.

344
00:21:40,505 --> 00:21:42,045
What the hell happened?

345
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:44,263
I didn't tell them anything.

346
00:21:45,902 --> 00:21:47,491
But I already gave them Hawkins.

347
00:21:47,822 --> 00:21:49,693
It's not about Hawkins.

348
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:53,732
They want to know about Jericho.

349
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:56,769
What our defenses are like.

350
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,815
Do we have any troops?

351
00:22:01,222 --> 00:22:02,729
Where are they posted?

352
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,097
Do we have a stockpile of weapons?

353
00:22:09,765 --> 00:22:11,139
We have to get back.

354
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:13,358
We have to warn them.

355
00:22:16,007 --> 00:22:17,100
We will.

356
00:22:20,824 --> 00:22:22,513
We're not going to die in here.

357
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:42,066
Hey. I'm taking off.

358
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,468
Thanks for all your help.

359
00:22:45,626 --> 00:22:46,869
Yeah. No problem.

360
00:22:47,273 --> 00:22:48,821
You need to get some rest.

361
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,029
I will.

362
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:53,377
Listen.

363
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,635
I am sorry if I was abrupt earlier.

364
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:58,533
We're all under a lot of pressure.

365
00:23:04,957 --> 00:23:06,529
Mary's really trying.

366
00:23:06,693 --> 00:23:09,121
Maybe... maybe
you could give her a chance.

367
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:11,209
Yeah, I know.

368
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:15,062
It's... it's just being here.

369
00:23:16,376 --> 00:23:18,511
This was April's whole world.

370
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,340
I miss her so much.

371
00:23:27,815 --> 00:23:29,333
I know. It's not fair.

372
00:23:33,257 --> 00:23:34,629
For what it's worth,

373
00:23:36,037 --> 00:23:38,078
you and Mary have a lot in common.

374
00:23:41,098 --> 00:23:43,089
What? We both love Eric?

375
00:23:44,614 --> 00:23:47,065
No. I was actually going to say

376
00:23:47,898 --> 00:23:50,080
you're both pretty tough broads.

377
00:23:52,616 --> 00:23:54,880
You're both... a little hardheaded.

378
00:23:55,713 --> 00:23:56,851
In a bar fight...

379
00:23:58,047 --> 00:23:59,209
even money.

380
00:24:18,494 --> 00:24:20,793
- Everything okay back here?
- Fine.

381
00:24:23,098 --> 00:24:25,431
Thought you were supposed
to stay off your ankle.

382
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:27,678
Whatever. It's not like I got shot.

383
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,071
I told you, Skylar. It wasn't our fault.

384
00:24:30,211 --> 00:24:31,549
I know. I just

385
00:24:32,528 --> 00:24:34,053
don't understand why now it's okay

386
00:24:34,205 --> 00:24:38,158
for all this random criticism about
my dad to come flying out at me.

387
00:24:40,727 --> 00:24:41,947
What is that?

388
00:24:42,551 --> 00:24:45,190
Especially coming from people
who were supposedly his friends.

389
00:24:45,673 --> 00:24:46,974
I guess they're not his friends.

390
00:24:47,074 --> 00:24:48,826
The Carmichaels used
to come over, like,

391
00:24:48,972 --> 00:24:50,591
every other week for dinner.

392
00:24:50,795 --> 00:24:52,368
We used to go on vacations together.

393
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,291
Why would they do
that if they hated him?

394
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:56,493
They don't hate him.
They're just scared of him.

395
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:01,208
My dad was a good person.

396
00:25:01,883 --> 00:25:05,038
He gave them the money
for the clock on Main Street.

397
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:09,362
He... he did lots of good things.

398
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:11,697
Maybe he did,

399
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,201
but that's not why
they were nice to him.

400
00:25:14,423 --> 00:25:17,227
They were nice to him because
he had a lot of power.

401
00:25:17,977 --> 00:25:19,420
That's how it works.

402
00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:34,632
We made it to the factory.

403
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:35,808
You both ready?

404
00:25:35,908 --> 00:25:38,444
We're going to need someone to cover
those guards over there.

405
00:25:38,544 --> 00:25:40,167
Ted, be ready to take them out.

406
00:25:43,146 --> 00:25:44,284
I thought I was driving.

407
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:47,089
Someone's got to be on those guards
while I get Jake and Eric out.

408
00:25:47,189 --> 00:25:48,632
Cover them until I get back,

409
00:25:49,353 --> 00:25:50,620
and if need be,

410
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:52,748
take out the sniper first.

411
00:25:55,783 --> 00:25:58,234
5 months ago,
you know what I was doing?

412
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,111
Customizing my truck.

413
00:26:00,985 --> 00:26:03,566
I was getting ready to defend
my dissertation.

414
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:06,147
Russian lit.

415
00:26:08,997 --> 00:26:11,610
How about you? What were you doing
last time things were normal?

416
00:26:14,354 --> 00:26:16,172
I can't remember back that far.

417
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,020
Is everybody ready?

418
00:26:18,822 --> 00:26:21,233
How will we know when
you're finished over there?

419
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,333
You'll know.

420
00:26:37,504 --> 00:26:38,571
I'll wait here.

421
00:26:39,427 --> 00:26:42,558
Russell, these are not your sons.
You can go on home.

422
00:26:44,283 --> 00:26:45,485
We can fix this.

423
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:47,602
It doesn't have to end this way.

424
00:26:48,496 --> 00:26:51,218
I get the feeling
it's just getting started.

425
00:26:52,831 --> 00:26:55,780
You can come to Jericho if
you want to. You know that.

426
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,349
I've got family here,

427
00:26:58,983 --> 00:27:00,132
a little girl.

428
00:27:01,311 --> 00:27:02,613
This is our home.

429
00:27:03,692 --> 00:27:06,836
And I keep thinking if I stay here,
maybe we can stop this.

430
00:27:15,452 --> 00:27:18,490
You get in a bad situation, go to
the railroad tracks and go east.

431
00:27:18,713 --> 00:27:22,015
It'll take you to Route 70 and
you can skip the checkpoint.

432
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:25,323
Thank you, Russell.

433
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,619
Good luck.

434
00:27:30,322 --> 00:27:32,129
We're going to have
to do this another time.

435
00:27:32,293 --> 00:27:34,792
- What?
- My deputy says it isn't a good day.

436
00:27:35,061 --> 00:27:36,657
You can come back tomorrow.

437
00:27:37,126 --> 00:27:39,683
I'm not leaving until
I see my sons, Phil.

438
00:27:40,067 --> 00:27:41,416
I'll tell you what.

439
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:43,980
You bring back all of my citizens

440
00:27:44,086 --> 00:27:45,611
who were shot in Jericho last night

441
00:27:45,728 --> 00:27:48,227
and I'll give you 15 minutes
with your sons.

442
00:27:49,142 --> 00:27:50,819
You don't want to do this.

443
00:27:53,024 --> 00:27:54,443
Let's go, Mr. Green.

444
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:56,965
What's this?

445
00:27:58,114 --> 00:28:00,911
We're going to escort you
back to the checkpoint.

446
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,902
Get in the car, please, Mr. Green.

447
00:29:00,674 --> 00:29:01,966
Mortars are good to go.

448
00:29:22,923 --> 00:29:23,935
Get up.

449
00:29:47,908 --> 00:29:49,347
Don't shoot me!
Don't shoot!

450
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:52,879
I'm the one they sent to get
the guy from Jericho!

451
00:29:53,028 --> 00:29:54,072
He tried to kill me.

452
00:29:54,213 --> 00:29:57,345
Please, I need to talk to Constantino
right away, please.

453
00:30:09,087 --> 00:30:11,421
<i>Constantino, I'm just telling you
what he told me.

454
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,825
<i>He's going right now to the factory
to blow it up, and

455
00:30:13,907 --> 00:30:15,615
<i>then he's gonna... he's gonna
blow up the town hall

456
00:30:15,637 --> 00:30:17,837
<i>so that he can get Jake and Eric out.
- You expect me to believe

457
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:21,599
he wired a government building
under 24-hour armed surveillance?

458
00:30:26,527 --> 00:30:28,733
I'm just telling you what he told me.

459
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:31,907
I'm trying to help you,
so you'll let me stay as a citizen.

460
00:30:31,989 --> 00:30:34,479
- Please don't lock me in here!
- Do you think I've forgotten

461
00:30:34,504 --> 00:30:36,234
how quickly you turned
on your own friends

462
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:37,733
when we first brought you in here?

463
00:30:37,822 --> 00:30:40,678
I don't believe a word
that comes out of your mouth.

464
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,532
Get him out of here.

465
00:30:59,696 --> 00:31:00,717
What is this?

466
00:31:01,502 --> 00:31:03,309
Come on.
You already know everything.

467
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:05,038
What do you want from us?

468
00:31:05,191 --> 00:31:07,279
- I already told you everything I know.
- Maybe so,

469
00:31:07,578 --> 00:31:09,561
but maybe your brother'll
be a little more...

470
00:31:09,818 --> 00:31:11,044
more forthcoming

471
00:31:11,243 --> 00:31:12,973
if he thinks it'll save your life.

472
00:31:14,897 --> 00:31:16,035
Let him go!

473
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:18,498
Let him go!

474
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:23,477
Move that barricade
and let him through.

475
00:31:58,912 --> 00:32:00,308
- Let him go.
- Tell me.

476
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,633
Let him go!

477
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,242
How many of the roads
out of Jericho are wired?!

478
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:05,826
- I don't know!
- What you know!

479
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:07,925
How do you defeat Ravenwood?!
Tell me!

480
00:32:08,383 --> 00:32:10,036
- Tell me right now!
- Eric, look at me!

481
00:32:10,151 --> 00:32:12,759
- Don't tell him anything!
- How many spies have you sent here?!

482
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:14,653
Tell us what you know
or we slice his throat.

483
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,053
Leave him alone, Perkins!

484
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:31,376
What was that?

485
00:32:39,505 --> 00:32:40,595
Come on!

486
00:33:12,368 --> 00:33:14,045
There was an explosion at the factory.

487
00:33:14,071 --> 00:33:16,173
- Move them to the warehouse.
- What about the other prisoners?

488
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,518
Just them, now!

489
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:19,330
Uncuff them.

490
00:33:19,506 --> 00:33:21,125
Come on. Let's go.
Un-handcuff them!

491
00:33:21,271 --> 00:33:22,280
Let's go!

492
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:23,664
Come on. Move!

493
00:33:43,911 --> 00:33:44,914
Jeez.

494
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,426
Where you going?

495
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:48,654
To get the... to get the truck.

496
00:33:48,702 --> 00:33:50,471
You were told to wait here
till I got back.

497
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,523
I know.

498
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,889
Breathe.

499
00:33:54,112 --> 00:33:55,203
Just breathe.

500
00:33:55,871 --> 00:33:57,783
Everything's going fine.

501
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,977
I can't do this.

502
00:34:00,692 --> 00:34:02,757
I'm sorry, no.
I can't.

503
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,118
I'm sorry.

504
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:47,351
Get up!

505
00:35:05,725 --> 00:35:07,297
- You okay?
- I'm good.

506
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,508
Jake, look out!

507
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:25,478
Over here!

508
00:35:30,008 --> 00:35:31,110
Everybody go!

509
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,729
Go! Get up!

510
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:41,155
Come on!

511
00:36:09,675 --> 00:36:11,845
<i>New Arrivals. Potatoes meat
inquire inside for trade.

512
00:36:11,974 --> 00:36:14,813
Thanks, Wayne.
Uh, with the rest in aisle 4.

513
00:36:28,575 --> 00:36:30,487
Can I help you, Mrs. Carmichael?

514
00:36:31,097 --> 00:36:32,880
I heard you've got some meat.

515
00:36:33,209 --> 00:36:35,250
One of Mr. Henderson's
mares broke her leg,

516
00:36:35,379 --> 00:36:36,810
but she was healthy.

517
00:36:38,927 --> 00:36:40,627
I'll take a quarter pound.

518
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:42,586
This is a pound of grain.

519
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,046
That's not gonna be enough.

520
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:49,612
But that's what it says.
It says 4 pounds of grain

521
00:36:49,738 --> 00:36:51,122
for a pound of meat.

522
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:52,734
The price went up.

523
00:36:53,251 --> 00:36:54,283
Sorry.

524
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,090
Please.

525
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,110
It's for Harry.
The doctor said he needs protein.

526
00:37:04,311 --> 00:37:05,567
It's up to you.

527
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:21,611
My father was a good man,
Mrs. Carmichael.

528
00:37:24,438 --> 00:37:25,541
Yes, he was.

529
00:37:28,845 --> 00:37:30,476
There's a quarter pound.

530
00:37:31,942 --> 00:37:32,986
Thank you.

531
00:37:45,946 --> 00:37:47,084
We're closed!

532
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:51,072
I just wanted to return this.

533
00:37:51,242 --> 00:37:53,470
- The antiseptic really helped.
- Thank you.

534
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:56,409
I have a fresh batch.

535
00:37:56,931 --> 00:37:58,057
We'll take it.

536
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:04,604
So there's no one in town who
wants to have a drink tonight?

537
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:08,346
You'd think the big draw
would be the atmosphere

538
00:38:08,499 --> 00:38:10,692
and the gracious hospitality,
but turns out,

539
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:12,041
it's the booze.

540
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,821
They'll be back when
I make more vodka.

541
00:38:15,284 --> 00:38:16,316
Thank you.

542
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,649
How's everything going
down at the center?

543
00:38:20,122 --> 00:38:21,142
Well...

544
00:38:21,362 --> 00:38:22,687
it's calmed down.

545
00:38:22,992 --> 00:38:25,033
We had to break up a lot of fights.

546
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:28,645
This whole New Bern thing
is making everybody really jumpy.

547
00:38:30,886 --> 00:38:32,065
Talked to Gray.

548
00:38:33,038 --> 00:38:36,382
Said if they're not back by dawn,
then he'd go up there himself.

549
00:38:39,826 --> 00:38:42,020
Then it's gonna be a long night.

550
00:38:46,278 --> 00:38:48,022
You're welcome to stay,

551
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:49,618
listen to music or...

552
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:53,324
I think I'll go home and wait there.

553
00:38:56,652 --> 00:38:58,107
If I hear anything...

554
00:38:59,186 --> 00:39:00,394
I'll let you know.

555
00:39:01,931 --> 00:39:02,963
Same here.

556
00:39:03,702 --> 00:39:04,934
Night, Mary.

557
00:39:19,581 --> 00:39:22,901
I didn't think we'd make it this far
with the gas in that tank.

558
00:39:41,969 --> 00:39:44,831
We, uh, we got about 12 miles
to cover, and,

559
00:39:46,204 --> 00:39:48,198
I don't think she's gonna make it.

560
00:39:49,207 --> 00:39:50,603
We have to try.

561
00:39:51,248 --> 00:39:53,794
She didn't leave us.
We're not leaving her.

562
00:40:02,507 --> 00:40:03,621
Here's your knife.

563
00:40:04,641 --> 00:40:06,535
- How's your shoulder?
- Yeah.

564
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,752
Hurts like hell.

565
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,051
It's good.

566
00:40:15,106 --> 00:40:16,537
How you holding up?

567
00:40:17,745 --> 00:40:19,047
I'm still walking.

568
00:40:19,493 --> 00:40:20,584
Yes, you are.

569
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:25,229
This is real whiskey.

570
00:40:30,706 --> 00:40:32,360
This is actual whiskey.

571
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,383
- I kept a stash just for emergencies.
- I bet you did.

572
00:40:46,337 --> 00:40:47,487
What do you think?

573
00:40:47,815 --> 00:40:49,763
It's no meteor shower, but...

574
00:40:56,773 --> 00:40:58,826
Thanks for coming to get me.

575
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,119
Smell that?

576
00:41:04,734 --> 00:41:06,212
First wheat's going in.

577
00:41:06,904 --> 00:41:09,133
Used to be my favorite time of year.

578
00:41:15,061 --> 00:41:16,727
Listen to that wind.

579
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,708
Still moving, even
after everything we did.

580
00:41:20,873 --> 00:41:22,808
With everything that's coming.

581
00:41:24,907 --> 00:41:25,916
We should go.

582
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:57,024
