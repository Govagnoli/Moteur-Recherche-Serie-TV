00:00:00,147 --> 00:00:01,428
<i>Previously on</i> Jericho

2
00:00:01,727 --> 00:00:02,977
We're the United States Marines

3
00:00:03,077 --> 00:00:05,044
and we're here to help.
- Lance Corporal Mullen.

4
00:00:05,185 --> 00:00:06,953
- Jake.
- Maggie.

5
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:10,770
They've got somebody on the edge of town
pretending to be their headquarters.

6
00:00:10,874 --> 00:00:12,519
- Is any of this real?
- The gun's real.

7
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:13,987
Hands up!
Get 'em up!

8
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:15,599
You're a smart girl.

9
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,910
You need to get out before
these guys get you killed.

10
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,014
And go where?

11
00:00:19,114 --> 00:00:20,672
Justin, you SOB.

12
00:00:20,985 --> 00:00:22,726
How the hell did you lose an election?

13
00:00:22,826 --> 00:00:25,292
The question is how did you get
to be in charge of New Bern?

14
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:26,844
They get tired of you being sheriff?

15
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:29,450
No, I'm still sheriff.
Just got a little more authority.

16
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,499
This thing work?
We get power from it?

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:32,727
Probably sometime tomorrow.

18
00:00:32,827 --> 00:00:34,307
Let's get it up as fast as we can.

19
00:00:34,407 --> 00:00:35,671
Can we buy some more
of these things?

20
00:00:35,748 --> 00:00:38,281
You got one of the only salt
mines around for 400 miles.

21
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:39,424
We're gonna need food.

22
00:00:39,524 --> 00:00:41,426
Ten wind turbines
for let's say...

23
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:42,932
ten percent of your spring crop.

24
00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:44,745
Okay, we'll give you the food.

25
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:47,102
We're gonna need ten Jericho men
to help us build it.

26
00:00:47,477 --> 00:00:51,342
What you are about to do
means this town's survival.

27
00:00:51,514 --> 00:00:52,593
All right, let's move out.

28
00:00:52,824 --> 00:00:54,890
Anything happens to any of them...

29
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:56,439
you're the first one I come for.

30
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:58,930
I didn't know you guys
were coming back today.

31
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,483
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.

32
00:01:00,543 --> 00:01:02,955
- Where's my brother?
- He hasn't been seen for a few days.

33
00:01:02,994 --> 00:01:06,199
<i>You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china.

34
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,624
It's a full inventory of Jericho.

35
00:01:08,757 --> 00:01:10,525
They sliceit up like they own it.

36
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:12,011
They're making mortar rounds.

37
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:13,546
They're getting ready for war.

38
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:14,650
Hold it!

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,480
Come on.

40
00:01:43,592 --> 00:01:44,766
This doesn't look good.

41
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:46,768
It could turn into a
full-blown riot.

42
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:49,331
As our guys show up,
you keep them back out of sight.

43
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:51,687
I don't want those New Bern
guys getting trigger-happy.

44
00:01:51,823 --> 00:01:53,846
This salt mine is
private property!

45
00:01:54,252 --> 00:01:56,537
You have 30 seconds to
get the hell out of here!

46
00:02:31,497 --> 00:02:32,983
What did I tell you, Ted?

47
00:02:33,093 --> 00:02:34,094
Sorry.

48
00:02:35,627 --> 00:02:36,643
I knew it was you.

49
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,788
Yeah, but if it wasn't me...

50
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,994
you just gave up my name.

51
00:02:49,988 --> 00:02:52,191
I want you to tell me
who your friend is

52
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,869
and where I can find him.

53
00:02:58,236 --> 00:03:00,301
Things are gonna get
very bad for you

54
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:02,914
and your brother,
vxyou don't help us, Jake.

55
00:03:04,424 --> 00:03:05,829
Why would I want to help you?

56
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:07,396
This is what I know...

57
00:03:07,694 --> 00:03:10,730
is that you, your friend
and your brother

58
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,810
were caught attempting to sabotage
this town's sole means of manufacture.

59
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,476
Manufacturing weapons. You were man...

60
00:03:15,576 --> 00:03:17,252
So I'm gonna
repeat the question:

61
00:03:17,352 --> 00:03:19,586
Where is your friend?

62
00:03:24,665 --> 00:03:27,825
Why don't you tell me what
vvhappened to Heather Lisinski?

63
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:31,965
Take him back.

64
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:33,107
Let's go, boy.

65
00:03:34,234 --> 00:03:35,626
Word's gonna get back.

66
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:38,001
It's gonna get back to Jericho
about what you're doing,

67
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:40,491
and there's nothing you
can do to stop it!

68
00:04:06,358 --> 00:04:08,220
- You okay?
- Yeah.

69
00:04:09,785 --> 00:04:12,460
- Looks like they went easy on you.
- Yeah, for now.

70
00:04:12,695 --> 00:04:14,729
They haven't found Hawkins yet.

71
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:19,071
We're gonna get out of here.

72
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:28,352
How many people have to die
before you don't care anymore?

73
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:31,880
April's death was not your fault.

74
00:04:32,678 --> 00:04:36,495
I can't even be sure Heather's dead
with the lies they're spreading.

75
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:39,658
I've seen, Jake.

76
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:44,633
I don't think I can go back.

77
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,973
Staying here and getting
yourself killed

78
00:04:48,073 --> 00:04:50,906
isn't going to make you
feel any better, trust me.

79
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,708
Remember the time
I was supposed to...

80
00:05:00,537 --> 00:05:02,868
wake you up for that meteor shower?

81
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:08,276
Yeah, it was supposed
to be this...

82
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,155
once-in-a-lifetime thing.

83
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,455
Anyway...

84
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:15,301
you were so pissed at me,

85
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:18,235
so I finally gave up
and let you sleep.

86
00:05:19,392 --> 00:05:20,941
I'm not giving up this time.

87
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,365
I should arrest you right here!

88
00:05:34,474 --> 00:05:37,009
It's not his fault. We had to deal
with him in New Bern.

89
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,511
Gray, what the hell is this?

90
00:05:38,683 --> 00:05:39,684
There's no deal!

91
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,227
I'm not giving away anything!

92
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:44,029
Listen, we'll think of something.
Right now we need to stand down.

93
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:45,739
No, we're not leaving
without our salt.

94
00:05:45,874 --> 00:05:48,702
- It's not worth people getting hurt.
- She's right.

95
00:05:49,492 --> 00:05:51,425
- All right, everybody...
- What are you doing?

96
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:53,407
Dale, I'm not going to
let people get killed.

97
00:05:53,507 --> 00:05:55,454
- This was your idea.
- This is over!

98
00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:56,654
Get your guys out of here!

99
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,735
Hey! Gray, come on!

104
00:06:17,305 --> 00:06:18,515
How many more are there?

105
00:06:18,615 --> 00:06:20,268
I'm not sure.
Six, maybe seven.

106
00:06:20,368 --> 00:06:22,331
We need gurneys.
What happened?

107
00:06:22,374 --> 00:06:23,705
Some guys from New Bern showed up

108
00:06:23,768 --> 00:06:25,705
trying to steal our salt.
There was a shootout.

109
00:06:25,743 --> 00:06:27,835
Oh, my God!
Okay, Harry...

110
00:06:27,944 --> 00:06:30,166
Harry, we're gonna get you
cleaned up, buddy, okay?

111
00:06:30,546 --> 00:06:32,329
All right, you need me
to look at your arm?

112
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,941
No, it's okay. I can wait.

113
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:36,928
We shouldn't be patching
those guys up.

114
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,098
We should be arresting them.
They opened fire on us!

115
00:06:39,134 --> 00:06:40,752
We don't know who shot first, all right?

116
00:06:40,753 --> 00:06:41,944
I'll get to an investigation.

117
00:06:42,044 --> 00:06:44,396
Right now we need to make
sure people don't die.

118
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,453
Oh, my God.

119
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,941
Get him to Kenchy... now.

120
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:55,729
Could we get some ice, please?
She twisted her ankle.

121
00:06:55,795 --> 00:06:56,795
I'm fine.

122
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:58,741
Hang on.

123
00:07:03,112 --> 00:07:04,145
Hold on, Harry.

124
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,196
Hey, Mrs. Carmichael.
Is he gonna be all right?

125
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:09,599
No, he's not gonna be all right!

126
00:07:09,756 --> 00:07:10,918
I didn't want this to happen.

127
00:07:11,018 --> 00:07:12,665
Why should we expect
anything different?

128
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:16,691
As long as you and your boyfriend are
all set, the rest of us can go to hell!

129
00:07:17,223 --> 00:07:19,320
Wouldn't your father be proud?

130
00:07:19,914 --> 00:07:21,572
What is that supposed to mean?

131
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,700
Okay, come on.
She's just nervous.

132
00:07:23,835 --> 00:07:25,819
Caroline, take a look at
her ankle, will ya?

133
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,136
Don't worry about it.

134
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:29,002
Gail, we heard about the shooting.

135
00:07:29,102 --> 00:07:30,987
I brought the antiseptic
I've been working on.

136
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:32,058
What can we do to help?

137
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,201
Look, I need charts on
everybody who's checked in.

138
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,230
Annie, show her how to
fill one out, will ya?

139
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:38,517
- What's all this gonna mean for Eric?
- I don't know.

140
00:07:38,528 --> 00:07:40,118
But haven't we heard anything?

141
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:41,529
I told you I don't know.

142
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:43,384
Johnston's working on it.

143
00:07:43,484 --> 00:07:46,912
Now what I could use is a roll
of gauze and some bandages.

144
00:07:47,012 --> 00:07:49,011
They're on the cart
next to the ultrasound.

145
00:07:49,043 --> 00:07:50,663
I just don't know
what that looks like.

146
00:07:50,695 --> 00:07:52,554
Never mind. I'll do it myself.

147
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:56,904
What the hell did you think
was gonna happen?!

148
00:07:56,905 --> 00:07:58,643
You didn't have to bring
rangers in there.

149
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,194
I was protec...
What?!

150
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:04,982
I'm afraid we've had
our first fatality.

151
00:08:06,394 --> 00:08:08,385
One of your guys
from New Bern...

152
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:10,540
Dawson.
I didn't get the first name.

153
00:08:12,221 --> 00:08:13,567
Jim Dawson.

154
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:18,207
You have got to let me
go back to New Bern

155
00:08:18,307 --> 00:08:20,632
and tell them that you support
this salt mine deal.

156
00:08:20,704 --> 00:08:21,709
No, that's not happening.

157
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,044
If they so much as think that
you fired the first shot...

158
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,854
- The who fi... What?
- Come on, Gray.

159
00:08:25,954 --> 00:08:28,368
We need to work together
while we still can.

160
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:33,727
Things are bad in New Bern.

161
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:36,684
And when they find out
that six of us came here

162
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:38,702
and only five are coming back...

163
00:08:39,989 --> 00:08:41,569
What are you saying, Russell?

164
00:08:43,228 --> 00:08:44,401
You got people there.

165
00:08:46,638 --> 00:08:48,078
You should bring 'em home.

166
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,479
Eric's still there.

167
00:08:57,179 --> 00:08:59,213
Johnston, you need
to know something.

168
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:01,873
vEric hasn't been seen
for a few days.

169
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:05,314
And yesterday, Jake went
back there to try and find him.

170
00:09:05,349 --> 00:09:06,825
You're telling me this now?

171
00:09:08,056 --> 00:09:10,622
All right, come on. We leave now,
we can get there before dawn.

172
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:12,772
- No, no, no. I'm not authori...
- Did you hear him?

173
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:15,000
Constantino wants a bigger fight.

174
00:09:15,297 --> 00:09:17,878
He's not gonna have
my sons as human shields.

175
00:09:20,229 --> 00:09:21,481
Let's go!

176
00:09:47,968 --> 00:09:49,157
Maggie?

177
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:57,841
Of all the jail cells, right?

178
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:02,553
Hardly recognize you
without your wardrobe.

179
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:06,089
What happened?
You guys get caught?

180
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,135
Kind of hard to pull that
voff without the tank.

181
00:10:12,754 --> 00:10:13,755
We...

182
00:10:14,272 --> 00:10:16,603
pretty much split up after Jericho.

183
00:10:18,426 --> 00:10:20,659
I came to New Bern with
a couple of the guys,

184
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:23,667
but we got turned away at the border
a few weeks ago.

185
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,132
I was dumb enough to try
and sneak back in.

186
00:10:27,257 --> 00:10:28,838
Why? This place is hell.

187
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,280
- It's worse out there.
- Really? That's hard to imagine.

188
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:37,737
I heard you two got dragged
in front of the Town Hall.

189
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,956
I don't want to scare you, Jake,
but you gotta get out of here.

190
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:42,251
It isn't exactly easy.

191
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,754
You could do it if you
got someone outside.

192
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:47,242
Why?
Do you?

193
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,683
Know someone outside?
No.

194
00:10:51,561 --> 00:10:53,407
I'm just trying to help.

195
00:10:54,557 --> 00:10:55,688
Last time you tried to help,

196
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,905
you nearly wiped out
my town's supplies.

197
00:10:58,126 --> 00:11:00,394
- I was trying to survive.
- Yeah, so were we.

198
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,428
Look, I'm not saying it was right.

199
00:11:04,008 --> 00:11:06,609
We had something people
wanted and we used it.

200
00:11:06,844 --> 00:11:08,080
That's how it works.

201
00:11:09,832 --> 00:11:12,242
You think you're helpless in here?
You're not.

202
00:11:12,268 --> 00:11:13,715
Not if you have something they want.

203
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:15,716
What makes you think
I have something they want?

204
00:11:15,736 --> 00:11:18,668
I don't think they're beating
the two of you up for fun.

205
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:21,229
Even if I did have something,
I wouldn't give it to them.

206
00:11:21,273 --> 00:11:22,812
You're right. You shouldn't.

207
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,295
But I could.

208
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:27,737
Yeah, right.
No, thanks.

209
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:30,941
Listen, if you talk... they're going
to throw you back in your cell.

210
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:33,870
There's no way they're letting
either of you out of here.

211
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:39,546
But if I had the information,
I could trade it for my freedom.

212
00:11:39,953 --> 00:11:40,966
And I can go get help.

213
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:43,082
What... give myself up
to get you out?

214
00:11:43,191 --> 00:11:45,209
So I can get all three of us out.

215
00:11:46,043 --> 00:11:48,077
And you can take me
back to Jericho.

216
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:52,426
I can't go anywhere without you.

217
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,172
Let's go.

218
00:12:03,813 --> 00:12:05,187
What are you doing?
Get up!

219
00:12:05,287 --> 00:12:06,926
Hey, where are you taking him?

220
00:12:07,072 --> 00:12:09,465
He's already told you
everything he knows!

221
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:17,660
How are things here?

222
00:12:17,895 --> 00:12:19,428
Harry's going to be okay, but...

223
00:12:19,757 --> 00:12:21,240
I'm worried about the staff.

224
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,761
Everybody's exhausted.

225
00:12:24,795 --> 00:12:26,332
You sure you're okay to drive?

226
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:27,798
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

227
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:32,331
Better hit the road.

228
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:37,275
Be careful.

229
00:12:40,032 --> 00:12:43,427
If I lose all three of you...
I swear to God...

230
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,106
I'm going to bring them home.

231
00:12:51,414 --> 00:12:52,806
You get some sleep.

232
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:02,203
Got to go.

233
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:22,035
What's going on?

234
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:25,069
What are you doing to him?

235
00:13:46,344 --> 00:13:49,348
Jake, just give me a chance, please.
We can end this.

236
00:14:04,163 --> 00:14:06,244
His name is Robert Hawkins.

237
00:14:08,778 --> 00:14:10,940
He said he's probably in a hunting cabin

238
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,675
owned by a guy named Ted Lewis.

239
00:14:12,775 --> 00:14:13,891
He works at the factory.

240
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,379
Find out where it is.

241
00:14:16,582 --> 00:14:17,583
Get over there.

242
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,924
You're supposed to
take me with you.

243
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:22,034
What?

244
00:14:22,472 --> 00:14:24,819
That's... the deal I made
with Constantino.

245
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:26,826
I go with you, and as soon as
you see the guy's there,

246
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:28,762
you drop me off at the checkpoint.

247
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:31,265
Just talk to Constantino.

248
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:33,729
This is... he was supposed
to be here!

249
00:14:34,926 --> 00:14:36,146
Take her with you.

250
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:38,524
If he's not there, kill her.

251
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:06,727
This is Johnston Green
from Jericho.

252
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:09,144
- We need talk to the sheriff.
- He's up at the cabin.

253
00:15:09,232 --> 00:15:11,087
We have orders
he's not to be interrupted.

254
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:14,332
He'll want to be
interrupted for this.

255
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:31,335
It's not exactly Mayberry, is it?

256
00:15:32,246 --> 00:15:33,454
Not since Ravenwood.

257
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:36,070
How are you with a rifle?

258
00:15:38,306 --> 00:15:40,144
I hunted jackrabbits before.

259
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:45,525
Well, I've never shot a person,
if that's what you're asking.

260
00:15:54,084 --> 00:15:55,739
We need to go back to the factory.

261
00:15:56,253 --> 00:15:57,511
We need mortars.

262
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,348
Well, for what?

263
00:15:59,514 --> 00:16:01,043
We can't launch them
over that fence.

264
00:16:01,235 --> 00:16:02,957
We're not going
to launch them from here.

265
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,650
Phil.

266
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:25,074
Nice spread you got here.

267
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:27,244
I always wanted you
to see this place.

268
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:28,474
Well, I just...

269
00:16:28,507 --> 00:16:30,428
wish it were under
better circumstances.

270
00:16:31,984 --> 00:16:34,766
I just found out Eric's been
missing a couple of days.

271
00:16:36,107 --> 00:16:37,697
I'd like a little update on that.

272
00:16:38,077 --> 00:16:40,279
And there was an incident
at the salt mine.

273
00:16:40,992 --> 00:16:42,515
Some of our people got hurt.

274
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:45,891
Let's take a walk.

275
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,453
<i>I'll go around back.</i>

276
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:01,909
<i>I got the front.
You watch her.</i>

277
00:17:02,307 --> 00:17:03,317
<i>Let's go.</i>

278
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:10,325
You better hope he's home.

279
00:17:16,406 --> 00:17:19,105
This mine deal,
this is your idea?

280
00:17:19,303 --> 00:17:21,704
I thought it could help the town,
create a partnership.

281
00:17:21,747 --> 00:17:24,230
- That didn't quite work out, did it?
- It was...

282
00:17:24,346 --> 00:17:26,399
mishandled all the way around.

283
00:17:26,737 --> 00:17:28,589
We were hoping we could
reach some agreement.

284
00:17:28,628 --> 00:17:30,808
It's a little late for that.
You opened fire on our citizens.

285
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:32,315
- We don't know who shot first.
- Come on, Phil.

286
00:17:32,316 --> 00:17:34,617
A bunch of guys shows up with guns
in the middle of the night

287
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:36,487
trying to take our salt.
What would you have done?

288
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,782
Jericho's continuous acts of
aggression against this town

289
00:17:38,783 --> 00:17:40,596
are unjustifiable.
- What "continuous acts"?

290
00:17:40,615 --> 00:17:41,988
We're neighbors, for God's sake.

291
00:17:41,989 --> 00:17:43,263
I didn't hear much talk of neighbors

292
00:17:43,264 --> 00:17:45,233
when you sent Ravenwood
straight to our door.

293
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:47,657
We almost blew everything
to hell and gone

294
00:17:47,658 --> 00:17:50,124
trying to defend ourselves
against those mercenaries.

295
00:17:50,322 --> 00:17:52,375
We had no idea where
they were headed next.

296
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:53,682
You couldn't try and warn us?

297
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,580
You couldn't help us when they were
raiding what little we had left,

298
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:58,175
shooting whoever got in their way?

299
00:17:58,358 --> 00:18:00,709
My deputies, my friends?

300
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,612
Then I find both of your sons.

301
00:18:04,285 --> 00:18:05,890
Both of them in my factory

302
00:18:05,928 --> 00:18:08,339
trying to destroy the last form
of capital this town's got.

303
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,358
Slow down.

304
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,525
Jake was apprehended yesterday,
attempting to sabotage my factory.

305
00:18:16,215 --> 00:18:17,474
That makes no sense.

306
00:18:17,475 --> 00:18:19,399
The factory's producing wind turbines.

307
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,436
Your sons are pretty
bent on the idea.

308
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:24,135
I caught Eric the day before
trying to do the same thing.

309
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,680
We're holding both of them.

310
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,779
Now, you listen to me.

311
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,908
I don't care what you think
we've done to you,

312
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,639
but if any harm comes
to either of those boys,

313
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,245
this is not going to end well.

314
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:46,679
There's been little chance
of this ending well for some time.

315
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,935
I want to see my boys. Now.

316
00:19:05,706 --> 00:19:07,626
What the hell's
taking them so long?

317
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,234
Who are you?

318
00:19:45,722 --> 00:19:47,477
- Don't shoot!
- Who are you?

319
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:49,199
I'm with Jake.
I'm with Jake.

320
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,480
- Columbus! Columbus!
- What you say?

321
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:54,196
Jake said if I said Columbus
you'd know he sent me. I was...

322
00:19:54,197 --> 00:19:55,322
I was with him in prison.

323
00:19:55,323 --> 00:19:57,613
He sent me to help you.
He sent me to help you!

324
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:58,788
Columbus, Columbus.

325
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:01,619
I got it.

326
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:06,354
How is Jake doing?

327
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,185
He's okay.

328
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:11,239
Yeah?

329
00:20:22,268 --> 00:20:23,317
That's Ted.

330
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:24,906
He's with me.

331
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,112
I'm Maggie.
Jake sent me.

332
00:20:29,277 --> 00:20:30,304
Where are the cops?

333
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,930
They've been dealt with.

334
00:20:36,198 --> 00:20:38,615
You don't want to go in there.

335
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,698
Here, this is everything.

336
00:20:49,757 --> 00:20:51,065
So, what's the plan?

337
00:20:52,688 --> 00:20:53,847
Plan?

338
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,026
There's going to be
an explosion in town.

339
00:20:57,432 --> 00:20:58,972
Hopefully, it'll cause enough chaos

340
00:20:58,973 --> 00:21:01,405
that we can somehow
get Jake and Eric out of there.

341
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,293
I think I can help you do that.

342
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,620
I have an in with Constantino.

343
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,712
Come on. Get up.

344
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,310
What the hell happened?

345
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:40,528
I didn't tell them anything.

346
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,756
But I already gave them Hawkins.

347
00:21:44,087 --> 00:21:45,958
It's not about Hawkins.

348
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:49,997
They want to know about Jericho.

349
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:53,034
What our defenses are like.

350
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,080
Do we have any troops?

351
00:21:57,487 --> 00:21:58,994
Where are they posted?

352
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,362
Do we have a stockpile of weapons?

353
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,404
We have to get back.

354
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:09,623
We have to warn them.

355
00:22:12,272 --> 00:22:13,365
We will.

356
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:18,778
We're not going to die in here.

357
00:22:34,347 --> 00:22:35,931
Hey. I'm taking off.

358
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:39,333
Thanks for all your help.

359
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:40,734
Yeah. No problem.

360
00:22:41,138 --> 00:22:42,686
You need to get some rest.

361
00:22:42,885 --> 00:22:43,894
I will.

362
00:22:46,234 --> 00:22:47,242
Listen.

363
00:22:47,448 --> 00:22:49,500
I am sorry if I was abrupt earlier.

364
00:22:50,404 --> 00:22:52,398
We're all under a lot of pressure.

365
00:22:58,822 --> 00:23:00,394
Mary's really trying.

366
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:02,986
Maybe... maybe
you could give her a chance.

367
00:23:03,854 --> 00:23:05,074
Yeah, I know.

368
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:08,927
It's... it's just being here.

369
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:12,376
This was April's whole world.

370
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:16,205
I miss her so much.

371
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,198
I know. It's not fair.

372
00:23:27,122 --> 00:23:28,494
For what it's worth,

373
00:23:29,902 --> 00:23:31,943
you and Mary have a lot in common.

374
00:23:34,963 --> 00:23:36,954
What? We both love Eric?

375
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:40,930
No. I was actually going to say

376
00:23:41,763 --> 00:23:43,945
you're both pretty tough broads.

377
00:23:46,481 --> 00:23:48,745
You're both... a little hardheaded.

378
00:23:49,578 --> 00:23:50,716
In a bar fight...

379
00:23:51,912 --> 00:23:53,074
even money.

380
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,658
- Everything okay back here?
- Fine.

381
00:24:16,963 --> 00:24:19,296
Thought you were supposed
to stay off your ankle.

382
00:24:19,484 --> 00:24:21,543
Whatever. It's not like I got shot.

383
00:24:22,235 --> 00:24:23,936
I told you, Skylar. It wasn't our fault.

384
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:25,414
I know. I just

385
00:24:26,393 --> 00:24:27,918
don't understand why now it's okay

386
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:32,023
for all this random criticism about
my dad to come flying out at me.

387
00:24:34,592 --> 00:24:35,812
What is that?

388
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:39,055
Especially coming from people
who were supposedly his friends.

389
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:40,839
I guess they're not his friends.

390
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:42,691
The Carmichaels used
to come over, like,

391
00:24:42,837 --> 00:24:44,456
every other week for dinner.

392
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,233
We used to go on vacations together.

393
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:48,156
Why would they do
that if they hated him?

394
00:24:48,332 --> 00:24:50,358
They don't hate him.
They're just scared of him.

395
00:24:53,431 --> 00:24:55,073
My dad was a good person.

396
00:24:55,748 --> 00:24:58,903
He gave them the money
for the clock on Main Street.

397
00:25:00,838 --> 00:25:03,227
He... he did lots of good things.

398
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:05,562
Maybe he did,

399
00:25:05,785 --> 00:25:08,066
but that's not why
they were nice to him.

400
00:25:08,288 --> 00:25:11,092
They were nice to him because
he had a lot of power.

401
00:25:11,842 --> 00:25:13,285
That's how it works.

402
00:25:27,004 --> 00:25:28,497
We made it to the factory.

403
00:25:28,634 --> 00:25:29,673
You both ready?

404
00:25:29,773 --> 00:25:32,309
We're going to need someone to cover
those guards over there.

405
00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:34,032
Ted, be ready to take them out.

406
00:25:37,011 --> 00:25:38,149
I thought I was driving.

407
00:25:38,254 --> 00:25:40,954
Someone's got to be on those guards
while I get Jake and Eric out.

408
00:25:41,054 --> 00:25:42,497
Cover them until I get back,

409
00:25:43,218 --> 00:25:44,485
and if need be,

410
00:25:44,924 --> 00:25:46,613
take out the sniper first.

411
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:52,099
5 months ago,
you know what I was doing?

412
00:25:52,522 --> 00:25:53,976
Customizing my truck.

413
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:57,431
I was getting ready to defend
my dissertation.

414
00:25:58,874 --> 00:26:00,012
Russian lit.

415
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:05,475
How about you? What were you doing
last time things were normal?

416
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:10,037
I can't remember back that far.

417
00:26:10,495 --> 00:26:11,885
Is everybody ready?

418
00:26:12,687 --> 00:26:15,098
How will we know when
you're finished over there?

419
00:26:16,165 --> 00:26:17,198
You'll know.

420
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:32,436
I'll wait here.

421
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:36,423
Russell, these are not your sons.
You can go on home.

422
00:26:38,148 --> 00:26:39,350
We can fix this.

423
00:26:39,537 --> 00:26:41,467
It doesn't have to end this way.

424
00:26:42,361 --> 00:26:45,083
I get the feeling
it's just getting started.

425
00:26:46,696 --> 00:26:49,645
You can come to Jericho if
you want to. You know that.

426
00:26:50,772 --> 00:26:52,214
I've got family here,

427
00:26:52,848 --> 00:26:53,997
a little girl.

428
00:26:55,176 --> 00:26:56,478
This is our home.

429
00:26:57,557 --> 00:27:00,701
And I keep thinking if I stay here,
maybe we can stop this.

430
00:27:09,317 --> 00:27:12,355
You get in a bad situation, go to
the railroad tracks and go east.

431
00:27:12,578 --> 00:27:15,880
It'll take you to Route 70 and
you can skip the checkpoint.

432
00:27:17,898 --> 00:27:19,188
Thank you, Russell.

433
00:27:19,464 --> 00:27:20,484
Good luck.

434
00:27:24,187 --> 00:27:25,994
We're going to have
to do this another time.

435
00:27:26,158 --> 00:27:28,657
- What?
- My deputy says it isn't a good day.

436
00:27:28,926 --> 00:27:30,522
You can come back tomorrow.

437
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:33,548
I'm not leaving until
I see my sons, Phil.

438
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:35,281
I'll tell you what.

439
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:37,845
You bring back all of my citizens

440
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:39,476
who were shot in Jericho last night

441
00:27:39,593 --> 00:27:42,092
and I'll give you 15 minutes
with your sons.

442
00:27:43,007 --> 00:27:44,684
You don't want to do this.

443
00:27:46,889 --> 00:27:48,308
Let's go, Mr. Green.

444
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:50,830
What's this?

445
00:27:51,979 --> 00:27:54,776
We're going to escort you
back to the checkpoint.

446
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:58,767
Get in the car, please, Mr. Green.

447
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:55,958
Mortars are good to go.

448
00:29:20,188 --> 00:29:21,200
Get up.

449
00:29:42,773 --> 00:29:44,212
Don't shoot me!
Don't shoot!

450
00:29:45,246 --> 00:29:47,744
I'm the one they sent to get
the guy from Jericho!

451
00:29:47,893 --> 00:29:48,937
He tried to kill me.

452
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:52,210
Please, I need to talk to Constantino
right away, please.

453
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:06,286
<i>Constantino, I'm just telling you
what he told me.

454
00:30:06,474 --> 00:30:08,690
<i>He's going right now to the factory
to blow it up, and

455
00:30:08,772 --> 00:30:10,480
<i>then he's gonna... he's gonna
blow up the town hall

456
00:30:10,502 --> 00:30:12,702
<i>so that he can get Jake and Eric out.
- You expect me to believe

457
00:30:12,781 --> 00:30:16,464
he wired a government building
under 24-hour armed surveillance?

458
00:30:21,392 --> 00:30:23,598
I'm just telling you what he told me.

459
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,772
I'm trying to help you,
so you'll let me stay as a citizen.

460
00:30:26,854 --> 00:30:29,344
- Please don't lock me in here!
- Do you think I've forgotten

461
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,099
how quickly you turned
on your own friends

462
00:30:31,118 --> 00:30:32,598
when we first brought you in here?

463
00:30:32,687 --> 00:30:35,543
I don't believe a word
that comes out of your mouth.

464
00:30:53,388 --> 00:30:54,397
Get him out of here.

465
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,582
What is this?

466
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:58,174
Come on.
You already know everything.

467
00:30:58,437 --> 00:30:59,903
What do you want from us?

468
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:02,144
- I already told you everything I know.
- Maybe so,

469
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,426
but maybe your brother'll
be a little more...

470
00:31:04,683 --> 00:31:05,909
more forthcoming

471
00:31:06,108 --> 00:31:07,838
if he thinks it'll save your life.

472
00:31:09,762 --> 00:31:10,900
Let him go!

473
00:31:12,214 --> 00:31:13,363
Let him go!

474
00:31:15,996 --> 00:31:18,342
Move that barricade
and let him through.

475
00:31:53,777 --> 00:31:55,173
- Let him go.
- Tell me.

476
00:31:55,325 --> 00:31:56,498
Let him go!

477
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,107
How many of the roads
out of Jericho are wired?!

478
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,691
- I don't know!
- What you know!

479
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:02,790
How do you defeat Ravenwood?!
Tell me!

480
00:32:03,248 --> 00:32:04,901
- Tell me right now!
- Eric, look at me!

481
00:32:05,016 --> 00:32:07,624
- Don't tell him anything!
- How many spies have you sent here?!

482
00:32:07,674 --> 00:32:09,518
Tell us what you know
or we slice his throat.

483
00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:23,918
Leave him alone, Perkins!

484
00:32:24,716 --> 00:32:26,241
What was that?

485
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,460
Come on!

486
00:33:07,233 --> 00:33:08,910
There was an explosion at the factory.

487
00:33:08,936 --> 00:33:11,038
- Move them to the warehouse.
- What about the other prisoners?

488
00:33:11,045 --> 00:33:12,383
Just them, now!

489
00:33:13,104 --> 00:33:14,195
Uncuff them.

490
00:33:14,371 --> 00:33:15,990
Come on. Let's go.
Un-handcuff them!

491
00:33:16,136 --> 00:33:17,145
Let's go!

492
00:33:17,274 --> 00:33:18,529
Come on. Move!

493
00:33:36,776 --> 00:33:37,779
Jeez.

494
00:33:38,085 --> 00:33:39,291
Where you going?

495
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,519
To get the... to get the truck.

496
00:33:41,567 --> 00:33:43,336
You were told to wait here
till I got back.

497
00:33:43,384 --> 00:33:44,388
I know.

498
00:33:45,745 --> 00:33:46,754
Breathe.

499
00:33:46,977 --> 00:33:48,068
Just breathe.

500
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:50,648
Everything's going fine.

501
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:52,842
I can't do this.

502
00:33:53,557 --> 00:33:55,622
I'm sorry, no.
I can't.

503
00:33:55,947 --> 00:33:56,983
I'm sorry.

504
00:34:39,196 --> 00:34:40,216
Get up!

505
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,162
- You okay?
- I'm good.

506
00:35:03,306 --> 00:35:04,373
Jake, look out!

507
00:35:17,264 --> 00:35:18,343
Over here!

508
00:35:22,873 --> 00:35:23,975
Everybody go!

509
00:35:24,585 --> 00:35:25,594
Go! Get up!

510
00:35:32,976 --> 00:35:34,020
Come on!

511
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,710
<i>New Arrivals. Potatoes meat
inquire inside for trade.

512
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:07,678
Thanks, Wayne.
Uh, with the rest in aisle 4.

513
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,352
Can I help you, Mrs. Carmichael?

514
00:36:23,962 --> 00:36:25,745
I heard you've got some meat.

515
00:36:26,074 --> 00:36:28,115
One of Mr. Henderson's
mares broke her leg,

516
00:36:28,244 --> 00:36:29,675
but she was healthy.

517
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:33,492
I'll take a quarter pound.

518
00:36:33,704 --> 00:36:35,451
This is a pound of grain.

519
00:36:37,175 --> 00:36:38,911
That's not gonna be enough.

520
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,477
But that's what it says.
It says 4 pounds of grain

521
00:36:42,603 --> 00:36:43,987
for a pound of meat.

522
00:36:44,304 --> 00:36:45,599
The price went up.

523
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:47,148
Sorry.

524
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:50,955
Please.

525
00:36:51,984 --> 00:36:54,975
It's for Harry.
The doctor said he needs protein.

526
00:36:57,176 --> 00:36:58,432
It's up to you.

527
00:37:11,884 --> 00:37:14,476
My father was a good man,
Mrs. Carmichael.

528
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:18,406
Yes, he was.

529
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,341
There's a quarter pound.

530
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:25,851
Thank you.

531
00:37:38,811 --> 00:37:39,949
We're closed!

532
00:37:42,154 --> 00:37:43,937
I just wanted to return this.

533
00:37:44,107 --> 00:37:46,335
- The antiseptic really helped.
- Thank you.

534
00:37:47,796 --> 00:37:49,274
I have a fresh batch.

535
00:37:49,796 --> 00:37:50,922
We'll take it.

536
00:37:54,232 --> 00:37:57,469
So there's no one in town who
wants to have a drink tonight?

537
00:37:58,924 --> 00:38:01,211
You'd think the big draw
would be the atmosphere

538
00:38:01,364 --> 00:38:03,557
and the gracious hospitality,
but turns out,

539
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:04,906
it's the booze.

540
00:38:05,715 --> 00:38:07,686
They'll be back when
I make more vodka.

541
00:38:08,149 --> 00:38:09,181
Thank you.

542
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:12,514
How's everything going
down at the center?

543
00:38:12,987 --> 00:38:14,007
Well...

544
00:38:14,227 --> 00:38:15,552
it's calmed down.

545
00:38:15,857 --> 00:38:17,898
We had to break up a lot of fights.

546
00:38:18,384 --> 00:38:21,510
This whole New Bern thing
is making everybody really jumpy.

547
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:24,930
Talked to Gray.

548
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:29,247
Said if they're not back by dawn,
then he'd go up there himself.

549
00:38:32,691 --> 00:38:34,885
Then it's gonna be a long night.

550
00:38:39,143 --> 00:38:40,887
You're welcome to stay,

551
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,483
listen to music or...

552
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,189
I think I'll go home and wait there.

553
00:38:49,517 --> 00:38:50,972
If I hear anything...

554
00:38:52,051 --> 00:38:53,259
I'll let you know.

555
00:38:54,796 --> 00:38:55,828
Same here.

556
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:57,799
Night, Mary.

557
00:39:12,446 --> 00:39:15,766
I didn't think we'd make it this far
with the gas in that tank.

558
00:39:34,834 --> 00:39:37,696
We, uh, we got about 12 miles
to cover, and,

559
00:39:39,069 --> 00:39:41,063
I don't think she's gonna make it.

560
00:39:42,072 --> 00:39:43,468
We have to try.

561
00:39:44,113 --> 00:39:46,659
She didn't leave us.
We're not leaving her.

562
00:39:55,372 --> 00:39:56,486
Here's your knife.

563
00:39:57,506 --> 00:39:59,400
- How's your shoulder?
- Yeah.

564
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,617
Hurts like hell.

565
00:40:02,825 --> 00:40:03,916
It's good.

566
00:40:07,971 --> 00:40:09,402
How you holding up?

567
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,912
I'm still walking.

568
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:13,449
Yes, you are.

569
00:40:16,698 --> 00:40:18,094
This is real whiskey.

570
00:40:23,571 --> 00:40:25,225
This is actual whiskey.

571
00:40:26,445 --> 00:40:29,248
- I kept a stash just for emergencies.
- I bet you did.

572
00:40:39,202 --> 00:40:40,352
What do you think?

573
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,628
It's no meteor shower, but...

574
00:40:49,638 --> 00:40:51,691
Thanks for coming to get me.

575
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:55,984
Smell that?

576
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,077
First wheat's going in.

577
00:40:59,769 --> 00:41:01,998
Used to be my favorite time of year.

578
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:09,592
Listen to that wind.

579
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:13,573
Still moving, even
after everything we did.

580
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:15,673
With everything that's coming.

581
00:41:17,772 --> 00:41:18,781
We should go.

582
00:41:37,404 --> 00:41:49,889
