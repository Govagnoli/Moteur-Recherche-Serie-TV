Hello, Rob.

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,750
Someone on my team
sold us all out.

4
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:08,972
You’re smart enough to know that they
would say anything to get you to talk.

5
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:12,508
Get the package.

6
00:00:22,598 --> 00:00:24,527
In the last three months,
I remembered

7
00:00:24,548 --> 00:00:25,738
all the reasons...

8
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:27,783
why I needed you in my life.

9
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:28,934
So have I.

10
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:31,376
I've also remembered
why it can never work.

11
00:00:31,576 --> 00:00:33,876
I told Darcy she and the kids
can come stay with us.

12
00:00:33,892 --> 00:00:35,790
Thanks, Jimmy.
I appreciate that.

13
00:00:37,687 --> 00:00:39,056
<i>We have also received reports

14
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:41,922
<i>that the bombers gained
the trust of local officials

15
00:00:41,923 --> 00:00:45,092
<i>which allowed the terrorists
access to secure locations.

16
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:47,405
I’ve heard that voice before.

17
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,019
- That's the guy that does the
farm report.  - It’s real news.

18
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:52,753
<i>In New York, the terrorists
who were apprehended,

19
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:55,747
<i>were all carrying nearly perfect
fake FBI badges.

20
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,435
<i>- You're drunk.
- Yes, I am, Darcy.

21
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,990
<i>Yes, I am.

22
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:24,607
<i>What ?

23
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:41,198
What is it, Rob ?

24
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,155
Is all that really
worth it for 6 kids ?

25
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:13,364
Six kids in a conference room
is not Harvard, but it's a start.

26
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:14,989
I meant for you.

27
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:18,364
I think it's time we start trying
to get things back to normal.

28
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:20,259
To be honest with you,
if I'm a kid...

29
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:23,709
going to school isn't exactly high
on my list of priorities these days.

30
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:25,667
Hey, Jimmy.

31
00:03:26,842 --> 00:03:29,322
Hey, can I... borrow you for a few
minutes, I need your help.

32
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:31,472
I'm going to get you
a bat signal or something.

33
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,839
What's wrong ?

34
00:03:35,872 --> 00:03:38,588
You remember, last week on the
radio broadcast, they said that

35
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:41,521
terrorists used fake FBI badges
to move through security ?

36
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:44,171
I've seen one of those badges.

37
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,356
Where ?

38
00:03:48,656 --> 00:03:51,485
I never went to Law school,
but I'm going to go ahead and guess.

39
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:54,017
- This is breaking and entering.
- It's called probable cause.

40
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:56,051
It's called paranoïd
abuse of authority.

41
00:03:56,435 --> 00:03:58,952
Come on, let's go... before he
comes home and catches you...

42
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:00,535
prying up his floorboards.

43
00:04:00,868 --> 00:04:02,535
The terrorists had FBI badges...

44
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:04,817
Robert Hawkins has an FBI badge.

45
00:04:05,134 --> 00:04:06,634
You think that's just coïncidence ?

46
00:04:06,717 --> 00:04:08,134
Maybe he's FBI !

47
00:04:08,276 --> 00:04:09,726
Please, tell me you thought of that.

48
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:12,601
I did...
and I asked his family.

49
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:14,601
And they all say he's FBI.

50
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:17,934
But... when they said it they all
had this look on their face like...

51
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:20,317
there was something that
they weren't saying.

52
00:04:21,587 --> 00:04:23,903
Sort of like the look I've got
on my face right now.

53
00:04:24,003 --> 00:04:26,653
Look, I had a hunch,
and I was right.

54
00:04:26,845 --> 00:04:28,495
Now, he's out on patrol...

55
00:04:28,595 --> 00:04:30,628
he's not going to be back
for a while, so...

56
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:32,503
Come on !

57
00:04:42,602 --> 00:04:44,235
Did you bust this lock open ?

58
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:58,108
You know, this is kinda
weird, but...

59
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,558
if he's FBI, isn't this what
his basement would look like ?

60
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,309
That's... that's what I said...

61
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:08,459
until I saw this.

62
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:16,598
- Does Gray know about this ?
- No.

63
00:05:16,798 --> 00:05:19,739
I wanted to get a second opinion
before I told anyone.

64
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:22,432
What do you want to do ?

65
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:13,759
Don't.

66
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:25,431

71
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:45,999
Hand it over.

72
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:48,299
Nice and slow.

73
00:06:52,405 --> 00:06:53,938
Slide it over.

74
00:06:58,127 --> 00:06:59,539
What the hell are
you doing here ?

75
00:06:59,556 --> 00:07:01,672
Did you wipe out 23
American cities ?

76
00:07:01,863 --> 00:07:04,080
- Get out of my house.
- Answer the question !

77
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:06,997
- Why would you even think that ?
- You've got a working generator...

78
00:07:07,031 --> 00:07:08,447
and a food supply.

79
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,703
So like you knew the
attacks were coming.

80
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,077
- I'm gonna give you 10 seconds...
- Back up !

81
00:07:13,277 --> 00:07:14,450
Jimmy knows I'm here.

82
00:07:14,783 --> 00:07:16,143
If I don't call him off
when he gets back...

83
00:07:16,157 --> 00:07:18,573
you're gonna have a lot more
people than me to deal with.

84
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,540
I'm an FBI agent, Jake.

85
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:22,323
That's what I heard.

86
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,046
Problem is the radio was reporting
the terrorists used

87
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:28,054
forged FBI badges to get
their bombs into position.

88
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:30,454
What is that room ?

89
00:07:31,923 --> 00:07:33,990
How were you involved
in all of this ?

90
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:36,540
I need to know.

91
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:43,057
5 months ago, this was
a map of our country.

92
00:07:43,957 --> 00:07:45,340
Now, it's an antique.

93
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:48,815
It's a picture of the way
things used to be.

94
00:07:50,286 --> 00:07:51,433
Right now...

95
00:07:53,994 --> 00:07:55,710
all we're sure of is this.

96
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,377
But this is where we
start to rebuild.

97
00:08:00,324 --> 00:08:02,274
So how do we do it ?

98
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
How ?

99
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:06,574
We look to our history.

100
00:08:06,957 --> 00:08:09,424
We study the people
that came before us.

101
00:08:11,332 --> 00:08:13,640
- Are you going to take attendance ?
- No.

102
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:17,373
Where are you going ?

103
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,986
My mom's at home right now...

104
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,186
trying to grow beets out of our
bathtub so we can eat newt month.

105
00:08:23,054 --> 00:08:25,137
This stuff...
isn't important.

106
00:08:38,021 --> 00:08:39,921
I guess school's out
early today.

107
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:43,737
You don't have to stay
if you don't want to.

108
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,169
I don't think I should be hanging
around at home right now.

109
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,223
So, I guess I'm stuck here.

110
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,865
<i>So it's come to this...

111
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,657
I want you to know this has nothing
to do with you personnally, I'm...

112
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,890
sure you're...

113
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:01,573
wonderfull.

114
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:07,873
But let's be honest here, you're
the one that lays the fewest eggs

115
00:09:07,874 --> 00:09:10,689
and I distinctly told all of you
that this was going to happen.

116
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,781
I believe I made myself perfectly
clear in that regard.

117
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:15,605
All right.

118
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:17,972
The thing is...

119
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:21,205
If you knew me at all,
you would...

120
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:23,155
see how really funny this is,

121
00:09:23,172 --> 00:09:25,005
because this is so not my thing.

122
00:09:25,038 --> 00:09:26,972
No... this is Stanley's thing.

123
00:09:27,888 --> 00:09:30,622
It's just... I'm awfully hungry.

124
00:09:30,705 --> 00:09:34,405
And... I don't want to get into the
whole circle of life business, but...

125
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:36,972
I just cannot eat anymore sprouts.

126
00:09:39,014 --> 00:09:41,264
OK ? Enough stalling...
Here we go...

127
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,130
Here's my concern...

128
00:09:45,197 --> 00:09:47,680
I've heard stories about how you're
gonna react to this, and

129
00:09:47,705 --> 00:09:51,105
if I see half of you running around,
well I just know I'm gonna freak out.

130
00:09:51,117 --> 00:09:54,526
So if you could do your best
to minimize that part of it...

131
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:56,667
I'd just really appreciate it.

132
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:03,525
Sprouts it is.

133
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,070
You really out here
looking for deer?

134
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:34,152
Thought they were all gone.

135
00:10:34,153 --> 00:10:35,428
What do you want Harry ?

136
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:38,990
Do you think you could come
into city hall today ?

137
00:10:39,023 --> 00:10:40,405
Gray’s still out, and
it’d be nice to have...

138
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,256
somebody around who knows
what they're doing.

139
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:45,768
Not my job anymore, and get lost,
I'm trying to shoot some deer.

140
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:47,731
Just be for a day or two.

141
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:54,614
You're starting to look an
awful lot like a deer, Harry.

142
00:11:02,854 --> 00:11:05,154
I've been in the FBI
for 15 years.

143
00:11:06,854 --> 00:11:10,421
I worked law enforcement after college,
and then I joined the bureau.

144
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:11,571
Where did you go to school ?

145
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,621
Georgetown, you wanna see my ring ?

146
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:16,954
The FBI, what were
you working on ?

147
00:11:17,036 --> 00:11:19,136
I was sent here to monitor
the phone calls

148
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,252
made in the area to a...
suspected terrorist cell.

149
00:11:23,086 --> 00:11:24,952
- And what did you find out ?
- Nothing.

150
00:11:25,002 --> 00:11:26,219
Trail went dead.

151
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:27,886
We about done here ?

152
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:30,641
Not even close.

153
00:11:31,174 --> 00:11:33,891
Tell me about her...
Sarah Mason.

154
00:11:34,974 --> 00:11:36,174
She's gone.

155
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,862
You're pretty thorough.

156
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,812
Also took care of the one
in the cabinet

157
00:11:49,902 --> 00:11:51,685
and the one behind
the water heater.

158
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:54,918
There's only one loaded
gun in this house...

159
00:11:55,402 --> 00:11:57,085
and it's mine.
Sit down.

160
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,921
Arms behind you.

161
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,271
Tell me about Sarah.

162
00:12:12,053 --> 00:12:14,836
Jimmy said she was also
a cop in St Louis.

163
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:17,619
She's working with you ?

164
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:20,136
Against you ?

165
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,119
Who are these people ?

166
00:12:22,236 --> 00:12:24,219
You are making a serious mistake.

167
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:27,546
- I am a Federal Officer.
- Really ?

168
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:29,979
Really sure you're not.

169
00:12:31,196 --> 00:12:34,213
Robert Willer...
State Department.

170
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:37,721
How about Robert Snyder...
Colombus PD ?

171
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,738
Commander Robert Richmond...
Naval Intelligence.

172
00:12:43,203 --> 00:12:46,153
None of those are real...
and neither is that badge.

173
00:12:46,636 --> 00:12:48,103
Who the hell are you ?

174
00:12:48,486 --> 00:12:49,944
Who do you you work for ?

175
00:12:55,716 --> 00:12:58,099
You do not wanna know
what I know.

176
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:00,166
- I think I can handle it.
- Really ?

177
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,666
Cause I can barely handle it,
and I was trained for this.

178
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:05,707
You want to tell me...
or you tell the whole town.

179
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:11,752
All right.

180
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:15,502
But once you hear this...

181
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,916
You are a part of it, Jake,
and there is no going back.

182
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,483
Who do you work for ?

183
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:24,916
CIA.

184
00:13:26,683 --> 00:13:29,816
Sarah Mason and I were part of
an off-the-books team.

185
00:13:30,231 --> 00:13:32,781
We were tracking the bombs
used in the attack.

186
00:13:32,964 --> 00:13:35,131
Where did they come from...
the bombs ?

187
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,381
The US government
brought them in.

188
00:13:38,731 --> 00:13:40,997
See, after the Soviet Union fell...

189
00:13:41,148 --> 00:13:44,014
neglected military in the
satellite republics started

190
00:13:44,015 --> 00:13:46,610
selling their nuclear stockpiles
on the black market.

191
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:49,348
So the CIA started
an operation...

192
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:52,877
get that material by any
and all means necessary.

193
00:13:53,477 --> 00:13:55,727
But a few years ago, a shipment
disappeared on its way

194
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,768
to the DOE storage complex
in Oak Ridge.

195
00:13:59,101 --> 00:14:01,651
And that is where my
CIA team came in.

196
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,730
Why you ?

197
00:14:03,013 --> 00:14:04,463
I'm the best at what I do.

198
00:14:04,897 --> 00:14:06,113
And what is that ?

199
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:08,997
Satellite installation.

200
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,842
I have a 2 o'clock appointment
with Mr. Higgins.

201
00:14:35,944 --> 00:14:39,061
I've been inside all day.
How's the weather out there ?

202
00:14:40,228 --> 00:14:41,828
You know, it looks like rain.

203
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:50,508
Thank you.

204
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,879
- Hello Victor.
- Hawkins.

205
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:06,962
I believe you know
everyone here...

206
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:09,349
except this young lady.

207
00:15:11,066 --> 00:15:13,266
- Robert Hawkins.
- Sarah Mason.

208
00:15:13,816 --> 00:15:15,582
All right, let's get down to it.

209
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,866
We have a lot of
ground to cover.

210
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:21,799
As most of you know...

211
00:15:21,982 --> 00:15:24,932
a shipment of nukes from
project Red Bell is missing.

212
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:27,172
What you don't know...

213
00:15:27,222 --> 00:15:29,705
is that we have quality intel
that those warheads...

214
00:15:29,764 --> 00:15:32,197
have been converted
into 25 small...

215
00:15:32,614 --> 00:15:34,197
high yield devices.

216
00:15:34,388 --> 00:15:37,371
These bombs have been
dissiminated to extremists cells

217
00:15:37,421 --> 00:15:39,655
active within the United States.

218
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:43,421
So, is this Al Qaeda ?

219
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:45,444
I wish it were that simple.

220
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,528
It's much larger than that.

221
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:50,594
It's a cross section of
domestic militias...

222
00:15:50,694 --> 00:15:53,094
anarchists,
and religious fanatics.

223
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,327
As you can see,
these are terrorists...

224
00:15:56,443 --> 00:15:59,760
that would never collaborate,
ideologically or politically.

225
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:01,959
The only thing that links
them, is the desire

226
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,977
to take down the
federal government.

227
00:16:04,343 --> 00:16:07,160
Our job, is to get undercover
in these cells...

228
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:09,218
and find these bombs.

229
00:16:09,384 --> 00:16:11,368
So who do we think
is orchestrating this ?

230
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,504
The agency's been at this
from every angle...

231
00:16:13,737 --> 00:16:16,587
and all we know is that
he's got deep ressources,

232
00:16:16,712 --> 00:16:19,045
an ability to coordinate
diverse groups,

233
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,445
and by all indications...
he's an American.

234
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:29,379
We were broken up
into groups of two.

235
00:16:30,204 --> 00:16:33,121
Each unit was...
assigned a terrorist cell.

236
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,640
One agent went undercover,
one acted as a handler.

237
00:16:38,607 --> 00:16:40,940
You can't expect me to believe
you were sent here...

238
00:16:40,964 --> 00:16:41,972
undercover.

239
00:16:41,973 --> 00:16:43,623
What's so special
about this place ?

240
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,744
You know, I would
show you, but...

241
00:16:47,061 --> 00:16:48,461
That's clever.

242
00:16:49,746 --> 00:16:51,946
It's over there...
behind the map.

243
00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:11,645
Where did you get this ?

244
00:17:11,757 --> 00:17:16,090
Those are defense department projections
they've been doing since the 50s.

245
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:20,690
The fallout scenarios in the event of
a nuclear attack on 20 US cities.

246
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,440
And you see Jericho ?

247
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:24,894
It's outside the fallout zones, Jake.

248
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:26,959
It's got a salt mine,
plenty of farm land,

249
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,210
and access to an untainted
water table.

250
00:17:29,285 --> 00:17:31,185
So you weren't here to
monitor phone calls ?

251
00:17:31,202 --> 00:17:33,885
Jericho was a rally-point in case
we failed in our mission.

252
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:35,045
Failed ?

253
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:37,312
Or succeeded ?

254
00:17:40,512 --> 00:17:42,512
And Johnston, was...

255
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,747
He wanted to come,
I know he did.

256
00:17:47,347 --> 00:17:50,347
He's just having a hard time
dealing with things lately.

257
00:17:50,914 --> 00:17:52,664
He always gets quiet...

258
00:17:53,097 --> 00:17:55,163
when he's going through
something, but...

259
00:17:55,213 --> 00:17:57,313
just wish I could think
of something

260
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,363
to help him get through this.

261
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:08,165
We miss you, sweetheart.

262
00:18:17,511 --> 00:18:18,711
There's no more sprouts.

263
00:18:20,178 --> 00:18:21,445
You finished them ?

264
00:18:22,128 --> 00:18:23,128
I was hungry.

265
00:18:25,158 --> 00:18:27,958
What are you doing here, Sean.
It's like 9:30 in the morning...

266
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:28,975
Oh, my...

267
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:31,841
You slept here ?

268
00:18:31,975 --> 00:18:35,308
Well, actually... there was not a
lot of sleeping going on.

269
00:18:36,641 --> 00:18:37,858
Get out of the house !

270
00:18:45,743 --> 00:18:46,784
What are you doing ?

271
00:18:46,851 --> 00:18:49,218
- You let him spend a night ?
- Yes.

272
00:18:49,401 --> 00:18:52,584
Well that doesn't seem like something
Stanley would approve of, does it ?

273
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,257
Stanley's not here.

274
00:18:57,474 --> 00:19:01,441
Just like that. You infiltrated a
terror cell planning a nuclear attack ?

275
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:03,532
Yeah...

276
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:06,029
just like that.

277
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:08,466
It took me 2 years.

278
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,782
8 months of it in prison...

279
00:19:10,832 --> 00:19:13,049
developing contacts,
getting into the network.

280
00:19:13,241 --> 00:19:16,557
The only outside person I
communicated with was my handler.

281
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,349
After prison,
I spent another year

282
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,757
trying to gain their trust
on the outside.

283
00:19:20,907 --> 00:19:23,274
And even then, I was only
scratching the surface.

284
00:19:23,307 --> 00:19:24,307
But you got in.

285
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,390
How ?

286
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,774
They were looking for
high grade government IDs.

287
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:34,407
You gave them their badges !

288
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,637
I had to proove that I was loyal
and valuable to the cell, Jake.

289
00:19:37,704 --> 00:19:39,954
- I think I've heard enough.
- No !

290
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,937
You barely scratched
the surface.

291
00:19:43,737 --> 00:19:45,403
You're the one who
wanted to hear this,

292
00:19:45,762 --> 00:19:47,754
so why don't you hear it all ?

293
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:04,065
The cell was looking for IDs.

294
00:20:05,255 --> 00:20:08,359
And I needed to get higher up
in their organisation.

295
00:20:08,738 --> 00:20:11,063
So I let it be known
that I had a source.

296
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:12,746
See, the badges...

297
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:15,912
were going to be tagged so that
my team could track them.

298
00:20:16,754 --> 00:20:20,120
They sent me to make the buy
with another cell member.

299
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:22,501
It was a kid named Daryl.

300
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:24,368
How do we know
these are real ?

301
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:26,184
They're real enough.

302
00:20:26,568 --> 00:20:27,739
Where did you get them from ?

303
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,234
How and where I got these
badges... is my business.

304
00:20:30,268 --> 00:20:32,601
What you do with them...
is yours.

305
00:20:48,406 --> 00:20:50,789
- Nice doing business with you.
- You too.

306
00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:55,989
We should celebrate, man.
Go out, get some girls.

307
00:20:56,802 --> 00:21:00,026
Except you don't really seem
like the type. All serious.

308
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:01,376
Are you married ?

309
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:02,934
I was.

310
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:05,393
Really ?
What happened ?

311
00:21:06,884 --> 00:21:08,384
What the hell is going on ?

312
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:16,249
Hold it right there !

313
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,082
I'm sorry man.

314
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:22,399
You gotta be kidding me.

315
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,957
FBI !
Hands in the air !

316
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,190
Back against the car.

317
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:39,426
<i>It turns out Daryl was
an FBI informant.

318
00:21:39,992 --> 00:21:43,142
But my handler got me out,
and we kept my cover intact.

319
00:21:43,706 --> 00:21:47,190
So the FBI have an informant
in my target cell.

320
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,506
And they can't tell us
anything about that ?

321
00:21:49,573 --> 00:21:52,040
You know, I'm damn lucky
that my cover wasn't blown.

322
00:21:52,123 --> 00:21:54,590
- Your cover's intact, yes ?
- Yeah, we believe so.

323
00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:55,895
Then let's move on.

324
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:59,129
Have you been able to make contact
with those coordinating the attack ?

325
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:02,545
No... but at this stage, I recommend
that we take down the cells

326
00:22:02,546 --> 00:22:03,912
that we've already inflitrated.

327
00:22:03,962 --> 00:22:06,779
You know, at the very least that
would disrupt the overall plan...

328
00:22:06,946 --> 00:22:10,388
maybe delay it for...
- How many of the bombs can you get ?

329
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,720
A third, for sure...
half if we're lucky.

330
00:22:15,703 --> 00:22:16,936
Look... I know...

331
00:22:16,937 --> 00:22:20,153
it's not ideal, but at this stage,
it is the safest move.

332
00:22:20,195 --> 00:22:21,812
That's still a dozen
bombs in play.

333
00:22:22,836 --> 00:22:25,352
- What are you doing ?
- I just think there's a way to...

334
00:22:25,486 --> 00:22:27,686
speed this up and get
all the bombs at once.

335
00:22:27,687 --> 00:22:30,136
- Yeah, and we agreed that...
- Do you mind ?

336
00:22:33,022 --> 00:22:36,372
I think there may be a way
to get us further inside.

337
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,905
My partner tells the cell leader
that Daryl is the FBI informant.

338
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:44,556
That gives him the credibility
that he needs to move up faster.

339
00:22:44,772 --> 00:22:46,705
Then let us handle the FBI...

340
00:22:46,939 --> 00:22:49,805
and do whatever is necessary
to save the operation.

341
00:22:51,209 --> 00:22:54,659
- It's all gonna take some time,
but we're close  - OK.

342
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:58,443
We're counting on you,
and you know the risks.

343
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,458
You'd better be right about this.

344
00:23:12,748 --> 00:23:14,614
This is the right way to go.

345
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:22,031
Trust me.

346
00:23:30,797 --> 00:23:32,230
What would you have done ?

347
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,280
Stayed in,
or pulled the plug ?

348
00:23:34,296 --> 00:23:36,521
It seems like the wrong
question to me.

349
00:23:38,191 --> 00:23:40,741
I'd ask myself how much
I trusted my partner.

350
00:24:01,768 --> 00:24:05,659
Well, if I can sneak up here without
you so much as turning around...

351
00:24:05,976 --> 00:24:07,959
how are you gonna
hear any game ?

352
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:10,750
I heard you half a mile
back in those shoes.

353
00:24:12,271 --> 00:24:14,821
You said you'd come with me
to see April today.

354
00:24:17,871 --> 00:24:18,871
Fine.

355
00:24:20,938 --> 00:24:22,671
You coming home for dinner ?

356
00:24:27,028 --> 00:24:30,778
There are no deer in these woods,
they've all been picked clean.

357
00:24:31,244 --> 00:24:33,411
Then, I guess I'll
be here a while.

358
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,277
I never wanted to be a mom'.

359
00:24:49,043 --> 00:24:50,477
I didn't sign up for this.

360
00:24:51,385 --> 00:24:54,169
You know what, you're right.
I owe it to Stanley.

361
00:24:54,435 --> 00:24:56,319
So I'm just gonna have
to jump in...

362
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:59,643
with both feet, whether she wants
to hear from me or not.

363
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,156
Listen to me going on
about my own problems.

364
00:25:03,157 --> 00:25:06,507
You must be ady to take this hatchet
and do the damn job yourself.

365
00:25:28,947 --> 00:25:30,964
I didn't know that he
knew how to sign.

366
00:25:32,455 --> 00:25:33,788
What did he say to you ?

367
00:25:34,305 --> 00:25:35,555
Never mind, look...

368
00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:36,955
That boy's bad news.

369
00:25:37,205 --> 00:25:39,155
Now, I can't stop you
from seeing him...

370
00:25:39,222 --> 00:25:42,888
but he is no longer welcome in this
house, do you understand me ?

371
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,089
Allison...

372
00:25:58,372 --> 00:26:01,039
so why do you feel like you
can't hang out at home ?

373
00:26:02,952 --> 00:26:05,002
You don't have to talk to me
if you don't want to.

374
00:26:05,018 --> 00:26:06,816
It's not that I don't wanna
talk about it.

375
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:07,966
It's just...

376
00:26:08,616 --> 00:26:10,000
my family's pretty weird.

377
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,633
My family was pretty weird too.

378
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:15,633
In fact, when I was your age, I didn't
want to hang out with them either.

379
00:26:15,724 --> 00:26:16,790
What about now ?

380
00:26:18,157 --> 00:26:19,240
They're gone.

381
00:26:22,784 --> 00:26:24,883
There's this thing that went
down at my house...

382
00:26:24,934 --> 00:26:26,184
a couple weeks ago.

383
00:26:28,692 --> 00:26:29,759
I did something.

384
00:26:30,647 --> 00:26:32,747
OK. What did you do ?

385
00:26:34,297 --> 00:26:37,163
I did something that...
can't be forgiven.

386
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,429
Now my mom just keeps...

387
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:43,179
looking at me.

388
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,594
Like I've changed into some kind
of monster, or something.

389
00:26:51,127 --> 00:26:52,727
You know you haven't, right ?

390
00:26:56,804 --> 00:26:59,128
So... even though you
weren't sure about the plan,

391
00:26:59,129 --> 00:27:01,254
you outed the informant
to the cell leader.

392
00:27:02,296 --> 00:27:04,396
Once we decided to leave
the bombs in play,

393
00:27:04,397 --> 00:27:06,962
it was the only way for me to
get deep enough into the cell

394
00:27:06,963 --> 00:27:08,196
and gain their trust.

395
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,829
I told the cell leader that
Daryl was the informant,

396
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,579
but I wanted to get him out of there
before they killed him.

397
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,012
Come on, grab what you
need and let's go.

398
00:27:16,895 --> 00:27:19,462
They're gonna hunt me down,
and they're gonna kill me.

399
00:27:19,636 --> 00:27:20,986
It's your lucky day, Daryl.

400
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:23,520
They're gonna get you into witness
protection, so don't worry.

401
00:27:23,536 --> 00:27:25,386
We're gonna get
you out of here.

402
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:28,669
Stay there.

403
00:27:34,283 --> 00:27:36,083
- Damn it !
- What is it ?

404
00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:38,233
<i>Daryl, we just wanna talk.

405
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:39,683
The cell leader.

406
00:28:09,238 --> 00:28:10,922
You gotta get me
out of this place.

407
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:11,955
Run !

408
00:28:12,147 --> 00:28:13,522
I'll tell them that
you got away.

409
00:28:13,555 --> 00:28:16,488
I think my leg is broken.
Please, help me !

410
00:28:17,604 --> 00:28:19,988
Or I'm gonna tell them
who you really are.

411
00:28:22,688 --> 00:28:23,688
I'm sorry.

412
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,819
<i>So, I finally gain their trust.

413
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:02,739
<i>I was in.

414
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:06,429
You killed him.

415
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,050
It was either killed him...

416
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:16,700
or possibly let millions
of people die.

417
00:29:16,867 --> 00:29:18,000
They died anyway.

418
00:29:41,314 --> 00:29:42,314
<i>Jake ?

419
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:44,081
<i>You're still down there ?

420
00:29:44,414 --> 00:29:45,414
Call him off.

421
00:29:45,964 --> 00:29:48,564
You're not helping your cause by
keeping that gun in my face.

422
00:29:48,648 --> 00:29:49,731
<i>Hey, Jake ?

423
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:51,848
Do not make me kill him Jake.

424
00:29:54,148 --> 00:29:55,164
All right.

425
00:29:57,981 --> 00:29:59,514
- All right !
<i>- Jake ?

426
00:30:06,254 --> 00:30:07,404
What's going on, Jake ?

427
00:30:07,521 --> 00:30:09,287
We need a little more
time, that's all.

428
00:30:09,295 --> 00:30:11,871
- You're sure ?
- Yeah, we're all right.

429
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:15,883
- I... I'm out front.
- OK.

430
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:31,151
Turn around, Jake.

431
00:30:47,697 --> 00:30:49,630
It is not about this anymore.

432
00:30:50,246 --> 00:30:51,246
We're past this.

433
00:30:53,787 --> 00:30:55,687
Starting now,
we trust each other.

434
00:30:57,237 --> 00:30:59,137
You need to tell me everything.

435
00:30:59,287 --> 00:31:00,295
Done telling.

436
00:31:00,754 --> 00:31:02,078
Now, I gotta show you.

437
00:31:13,378 --> 00:31:14,628
What are you doing here ?

438
00:31:14,761 --> 00:31:16,694
It's your first day
at a new school.

439
00:31:18,731 --> 00:31:21,664
You know, the last time you had one
of those, Sam was in diapers.

440
00:31:24,314 --> 00:31:26,798
Doesn'’t look like you
had a big turnout.

441
00:31:27,338 --> 00:31:29,788
No, most people left early.

442
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:32,038
I guess you knew better.

443
00:31:34,418 --> 00:31:37,584
I figured you didn't really want
me around the house anyway.

444
00:31:40,218 --> 00:31:41,818
Why would you say that ?

445
00:31:44,886 --> 00:31:45,886
You know...

446
00:31:46,152 --> 00:31:47,619
because of what I did.

447
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,452
Allison, I love you.

448
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,019
OK ? Nothing will
change that.

449
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,041
Hear me baby ?

450
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,875
Nothing will change that.

451
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:03,875
My little girl.

452
00:32:07,653 --> 00:32:10,720
Mom, please
don't be mad at me.

453
00:32:11,837 --> 00:32:13,387
I'm so sorry, mom'.

454
00:32:28,182 --> 00:32:30,249
- Here's the part I don't get.
- What ?

455
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,282
If you're telling the truth...

456
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:34,565
you made it.

457
00:32:35,149 --> 00:32:38,365
You made it deep inside the cell,
you gained their trust.

458
00:32:38,981 --> 00:32:39,981
Right.

459
00:32:40,664 --> 00:32:42,064
Then, what happened ?

460
00:32:45,114 --> 00:32:47,231
Somebody tipped off the
terrorists, Jake.

461
00:32:48,536 --> 00:32:50,253
Before we could find out who...

462
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,520
<i>the terrorists moved up
their plan.

463
00:32:54,108 --> 00:32:55,441
Victor ?

464
00:32:55,524 --> 00:32:58,132
We made a mistake,
<i>a very big mistake.</i>

465
00:32:59,174 --> 00:33:01,824
This is the moment we prepared for.

466
00:33:02,385 --> 00:33:05,868
Strike will go off tomorrow,
at precisely 8:05 Eastern.

467
00:33:07,718 --> 00:33:09,318
OK. No... listen !

468
00:33:09,385 --> 00:33:10,385
The trucks...

469
00:33:10,935 --> 00:33:11,935
they're white.

470
00:33:12,068 --> 00:33:16,551
License plate
Kansas, 5-4-3, George, Union, Ida...

471
00:33:17,051 --> 00:33:18,985
<i>I tried to warn the agency...

472
00:33:19,385 --> 00:33:20,785
<i>but we were too late.

473
00:33:25,646 --> 00:33:27,846
Some of the bombs were meant
for New York.

474
00:33:27,975 --> 00:33:29,759
We managed to head them off.

475
00:33:35,175 --> 00:33:37,108
Even after 4 years of work...

476
00:33:37,524 --> 00:33:39,458
I couldn't stop all of them.

477
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:44,455
<i>I'm gonna have to live with that
for the rest of my life.

478
00:34:01,923 --> 00:34:03,690
Since when have
you been funny ?

479
00:34:03,857 --> 00:34:05,524
I have always been funny.

480
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,724
Yeah, not for a long time.

481
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:22,895
What is it Rob ?

482
00:34:26,779 --> 00:34:28,579
- Rob ?
- I won't be long.

483
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:39,976
Not interrupting, am I ?

484
00:34:40,509 --> 00:34:42,126
You know you are.

485
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,957
You're not exactly
returning our calls.

486
00:34:44,981 --> 00:34:46,715
I told my wife I was done.

487
00:34:47,915 --> 00:34:48,915
I promised her, Victor.

488
00:34:51,127 --> 00:34:53,193
- We need you back.
- Why me ?

489
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:54,927
Because you're the best
at what you do.

490
00:34:54,943 --> 00:34:56,127
Which is what ?

491
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,060
Your family will be there,
when you get back.

492
00:35:02,509 --> 00:35:04,026
Team is meeting tomorrow.

493
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,750
Come listen to what this
is all about.

494
00:35:07,067 --> 00:35:08,958
If you wanna walk
away after that...

495
00:35:09,292 --> 00:35:10,292
you walk away.

496
00:35:15,124 --> 00:35:16,324
2 o'clock...

497
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:17,991
tomorrow.

498
00:35:18,808 --> 00:35:21,774
Tell the desk jockey you have an
appointment with Mr. Higgins.

499
00:35:22,841 --> 00:35:24,941
If they ask about the weather...

500
00:35:25,908 --> 00:35:27,574
tell hem it's gonna rain.

501
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:35,769
Who was that ?

502
00:35:46,538 --> 00:35:49,238
I might need to go
to a meeting tomorow.

503
00:35:51,071 --> 00:35:53,038
I can't keep doing this,
I can't.

504
00:35:54,538 --> 00:35:55,671
We'll be fine, D.

505
00:36:12,827 --> 00:36:13,827
What is that ?

506
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,927
It's the end of the
rabbit hole, Jake.

507
00:36:20,782 --> 00:36:22,316
Gimme a hand with this.

508
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,493
So you believe me now ?

509
00:36:48,683 --> 00:36:50,549
Is that what I think it is ?

510
00:36:51,883 --> 00:36:54,549
It was meant for Columbus, Ohio.

511
00:36:55,586 --> 00:36:58,503
You brought a nuclear bomb...
here.

512
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,603
What would you have
done with it ?

513
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,920
What do you gonna do with it ?

514
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,274
I'm gonna keep it safe.

515
00:37:08,524 --> 00:37:11,124
I'm gonna keep it secret,
you know. Because...

516
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:16,161
it gives the town some power, Jake,
but it also makes them a target.

517
00:37:16,427 --> 00:37:17,427
Look...

518
00:37:19,788 --> 00:37:21,454
I know what you're thinking...

519
00:37:21,654 --> 00:37:24,421
You're wishing you'd walked away
when I gave you the chance, right ?

520
00:37:24,422 --> 00:37:26,916
Why didn’t you show me thing
when I walked in the door today.

521
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:28,288
You didn't walk in.

522
00:37:29,268 --> 00:37:30,277
<i>Jake ?

523
00:37:32,327 --> 00:37:33,340
<i>Hey, Jake ?

524
00:37:35,952 --> 00:37:37,514
I've been watching you, Jake...

525
00:37:37,598 --> 00:37:39,264
and you can handle yourself.

526
00:37:39,381 --> 00:37:41,848
And I've seen what a help
you have been to this stown.

527
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:44,010
But I needed to know
that I can trust you.

528
00:37:44,143 --> 00:37:46,860
That you could handle it
if I told you everything.

529
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:48,726
<i>Jake ?

530
00:37:51,176 --> 00:37:52,176
This bomb...

531
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:55,048
it's our burden, now.

532
00:37:56,115 --> 00:37:57,715
Whatever happens next...

533
00:37:57,948 --> 00:38:00,698
that is gonna be
up to you. OK ?

534
00:38:25,465 --> 00:38:26,465
He's FBI.

535
00:38:27,298 --> 00:38:28,498
Just like he said.

536
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:30,215
But...

537
00:38:31,181 --> 00:38:32,515
We're in good hands.

538
00:38:34,065 --> 00:38:35,403
That's good to hear.

539
00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:38,875
I'm sorry about all this,
Mr. Hawkins.

540
00:39:04,737 --> 00:39:06,724
We do that, outside.

541
00:39:08,761 --> 00:39:10,026
I didn't know that.

542
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:15,781
There’s something
I want to say to you.

543
00:39:16,906 --> 00:39:18,300
I'm still learning...

544
00:39:18,687 --> 00:39:20,623
so just, please bear with me.

545
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:30,265
Stanley...
is...

546
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:33,801
important...
to me.

547
00:39:35,512 --> 00:39:39,744
You... are...
important... to me.

548
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:47,262
I... want... you...
to be safe.

549
00:39:49,031 --> 00:39:53,521
So please... be patient...
with me.

550
00:39:54,038 --> 00:39:55,663
I'm trying...

551
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,784
I'll try too.

552
00:40:02,384 --> 00:40:03,391
So...

553
00:40:04,475 --> 00:40:05,481
hug ?

554
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:11,209
Right.

555
00:40:27,226 --> 00:40:28,955
I brought you some dinner.

556
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:35,480
Thank you.

557
00:41:02,532 --> 00:41:05,815
<i>You know what, I am damn lucky
that my cover wasn’t blown.

558
00:41:06,254 --> 00:41:08,138
<i>- Your cover's intact ?
- Yeah, we believe so.

559
00:41:08,206 --> 00:41:09,221
<i>Then let's move on.

560
00:41:09,247 --> 00:41:11,673
<i>But at this stage, I recommend
that we take down the cells

561
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:13,867
<i>that we've already
infiltrated...

562
00:41:14,731 --> 00:41:17,338
<i>How many of the bombs
can you get ?

563
00:41:44,355 --> 00:41:46,755
How many of the bombs
can you get ?

564
