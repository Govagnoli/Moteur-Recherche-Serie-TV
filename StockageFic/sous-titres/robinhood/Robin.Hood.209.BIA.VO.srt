1
00:00:06,979 --> 00:00:08,480
Excuse me.

2
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:13,944
Guy, there's
a messenger outside with a letter.

3
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:16,783
He's insisting he gives it to
the Lord Of The Manor in person.

4
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:20,761
Is it from Lady Marian?
No, he says it's from the King.

5
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:22,260
The King?

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,304
So where is he, then?

7
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:29,187
Well, he was here a minute ago.

8
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:33,400
He thought Robin was still
Lord Of The Manor. Maybe he
found out he wasn't and ran off.

9
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,223
And what fool told him that?

10
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,983
Get after him! I want that letter!

11
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:43,959
Yeah. He won't get far.
He's only on foot. Ha!

12
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:46,746
Hey. Guards, come on!

13
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,924
Happy Birthday, Gisborne.

14
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:51,489
Party going well, is it?

15
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:53,003
We've got a problem.

16
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,567
Just give us the letter and
we'll let you go, all right? No!

17
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:22,085
SHOUTING IN THE DISTANCE

18
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,703
Oi! Over 'ere.

19
00:01:26,699 --> 00:01:28,587
Come along!

20
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:31,787
Look, you've got the most
distinctive tracks in the forest.

21
00:01:31,779 --> 00:01:34,259
You might as well give up now!

22
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,408
This way!

23
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:06,385
BRANCH CREAKS

24
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:09,662
HE PANTS

25
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:15,069
Aaaaargh!

26
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:17,641
Ooh! Oh-uh!

27
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,709
Uh.

28
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:21,781
HE GRUNTS IN PAIN

29
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:25,445
Give us the message from the King.

30
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,782
It's for Robin Of
Locksley and his eyes only.

31
00:02:27,779 --> 00:02:29,986
Just give it to me
or we'll take it from you.

32
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:31,970
ARROW ZOOMING THROUGH THE AIR

33
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:33,142
Ugh! Ugh!

34
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:41,166
Don't you know it's rude
to read other people's mail? !

35
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:26,343
By the time you get close
enough to use those swords,
you'll be so full of arrows,

36
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,443
you'll look like hedgehogs.

37
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:32,582
HE CHUCKLES

38
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,524
So. . .

39
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:37,750
This is what Gisborne's
dogsbody does, is it?

40
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,139
I'm not his dogsbody.
I'm his right-hand man.

41
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:42,505
Oh.

42
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:45,468
I couldn't face myself
in the morning, if I was you.

43
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:50,385
I count my money in the morning.
While you two are squabbling,
there's a man in agony over there.

44
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:52,062
Run back to your master.

45
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:53,060
Go on.

46
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:55,640
Go on!

47
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,746
RUN!

48
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,526
Do you practise
little speeches like that?

49
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,467
Like what? "You'll be so full of
arrows, you'll look like hedgehogs."

50
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:11,123
No, it just came to mind.
You practise, don't you? No.

51
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:13,986
Robin. . . Ssh-sh-sh-sh.

52
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:15,503
I know you.

53
00:04:15,499 --> 00:04:17,126
MAN GROANS IN PAIN

54
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:19,405
Save your strength.

55
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,900
Lardner. . .

56
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,642
Lardner!

57
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:34,703
It's the royal seal.
It is from Richard.

58
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:41,048
So, where are they, Gisborne?

59
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:43,906
They'll be here. Woodcock, Sir Guy.

60
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:46,561
Birthday treat.

61
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:48,481
Shall I get started?

62
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,401
If you must.

63
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,867
Your men had better get
to him before Robin does.

64
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,885
He wants reinforcements.

65
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,006
He wants more men.

66
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:04,366
He still has got no idea. He has
no idea what's happening in England.

67
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:07,681
The message you sent with Carter.
It can't have reached the King yet.

68
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:11,206
Many a courier gets intercepted.
The proof of that's right here.

69
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,484
He wants me to send. . .

70
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,567
. .a note back with. . .

71
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:19,165
Lardner, telling him how many men
I can recruit and when I'll arrive.

72
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:26,887
But. . . This. . . This isn't Lardner.

73
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,484
This is McLellan.
This is Lawrence McLellan.

74
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:30,980
Well, then who's Lardner?

75
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,444
Richard The Lionheart,
they call him.

76
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:45,866
Going into battle in
a foreign land, it's not the
heart of a lion you want, is it?

77
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:46,905
Huh?

78
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:51,086
Since when did
a heart hurt anybody? Huh? !

79
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:53,559
Come on then! Come on!

80
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:55,800
I've got the heart of a lion!

81
00:05:57,559 --> 00:06:01,609
You can imagine the Saracens
translating that, can't you?

82
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:02,964
LAUGHTER

83
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,041
"He's got the what of a lion?

84
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,519
"The teeth?

85
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,443
"The jaws? The claws?"

86
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,487
LAUGHTER

87
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,880
No! The heart!

88
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:18,404
Richard The Lion Claw,
Jerusalem's yours.

89
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,926
Come in. Sit down. Help yourself!

90
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,649
Lion Heart?

91
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,688
It's good, very good.
Forget about it.

92
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:31,206
It's no wonder it's taking
him so long over there, is it?

93
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,484
LAUGHTER

94
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:38,319
Mind you, mind you. . .

95
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,685
It's better
than his brother, isn't it?

96
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:42,943
Prince John.

97
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:45,043
What's Prince John doing?

98
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,361
Sitting at home,
heart of a dormouse?

99
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:51,465
Prince John is a friend of mine!

100
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:52,699
It's a joke. It's what I do.

101
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:55,202
I do other things.
Let's try some soothsaying.

102
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,750
Sit down, sit down, sit down.
I'll make some predictions and
then I'll make them come true.

103
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:03,425
Someone in this room
will bare their buttocks
to the Sheriff tonight.

104
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,068
Take that man to the dungeons now!

105
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:09,223
No, hang on. Prediction two, Sir
Guy's joint will rise from the dead.

106
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:14,225
What's that supposed to mean?
Your woodcock, Sir Guy, I can bring
it back to life. Get rid of him!

107
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:16,403
My third prediction's
about Prince John.

108
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:18,867
One day Prince John will be King
of England. I know that already.

109
00:07:18,859 --> 00:07:22,943
But did you know there's something
in Nottingham that can stop him?
Like what?

110
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:25,339
Lardner's Ring.

111
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:27,227
What is Lardner's Ring?

112
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:29,608
Well, let me go and I'll tell you.

113
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,729
Lock him in the cell overnight,
flog him in the morning
and then he'll tell us.

114
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,347
Now that really is funny!

115
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:37,567
RAUCOUS LAUGHTER

116
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:40,904
You should listen to me!
I know what I'm talking about.

117
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,663
Ah!

118
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:48,460
The first prediction! I told you!
And the others will follow.

119
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:50,609
Beware the power of Lardner's Ring.

120
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,061
What is Lardner's Ring?

121
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:07,127
I know I'm meant to be loyal
and obedient, but the King
doesn't know the facts.

122
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,360
And once he does, then we turn home.

123
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:12,066
And this is no time for you
to go back to the Holy Land.

124
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:16,147
We're agreed then.

125
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:20,947
Absolutely.

126
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:32,361
Would you like to say a few words?

127
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:41,826
Go on then.

128
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:47,019
Will you marry me?

129
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,740
What?

130
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,649
The first time I held my bow,
I knew.

131
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:06,202
It felt right.

132
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:07,666
Like it had been made for me.

133
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,223
And that's how I feel about you.

134
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:19,582
I promised your father
I would protect and look after you.

135
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:23,287
But it works both ways.

136
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,300
I look after my bow because
it protects and looks after me.

137
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,463
Together we're stronger.

138
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,649
So. . .

139
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,685
Marian.

140
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,806
Will you marry me?

141
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,845
Robin,
of every single man in the world,

142
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:08,049
you are the only one. . .

143
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,610
Is that a yes?
Will you let me finish?

144
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:12,965
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:19,728
The only one who would
propose over a fresh grave

146
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:23,644
by comparing me to your weapon.
Well, is that a no?

147
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:25,379
Who will give me away?

148
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:27,882
I can ask the King.

149
00:10:31,619 --> 00:10:34,486
So we find Lardner
and bring the King home.

150
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,985
Defeat the Sheriff

151
00:10:38,979 --> 00:10:41,004
and then we get married.

152
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:46,663
Well, that sounds like a plan.

153
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:59,243
Move, you worm!

154
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:01,400
MEN MOAN

155
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,581
Right.

156
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,570
Uh!

157
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,709
What's that? !

158
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:11,564
It's a dove.

159
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:14,005
Well, I've seen it all now!

160
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:20,227
Here, why do you keep
a bird in your pocket?

161
00:11:20,219 --> 00:11:22,483
Why do you keep
a worm in your pants?

162
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,187
You should keep an eye
on that belt of yours!

163
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,246
Where is he?

164
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:43,029
He's dead. What about the message?
Well, we got part of it, yeah.

165
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:45,590
But Robin turned up. . .
Turned up?!

166
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:49,583
And got his message? I don't know.

167
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:51,547
Look, he kinda took us by surprise.

168
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:54,770
All we heard him say
was "Lardner", that was it.

169
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:57,425
(Lardner.)

170
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:59,023
(That's what he said.)

171
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:06,227
I blame you for this!

172
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,467
You had him on your doorstep
and you let him escape? !

173
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:12,700
You and your imbeciles!

174
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:16,829
Six legs against one and the one

175
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,707
got away!

176
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:20,223
PEOPLE GASP

177
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:37,583
There's an explanation. There
is always a rational explanation.

178
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:46,780
We know McLellan and the Fool spoke
together, so something was said
about the ring of Lardner.

179
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:49,623
Maybe it's got a coded
inscription on it. It's no problem.

180
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:52,907
We'll just torture the Fool
until he tells us.

181
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:55,623
He's disappeared!

182
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:00,943
I know that, you blithering oaf!

183
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:16,668
Know anyone called Lardner?

184
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,685
Have you ever known
or heard of anyone

185
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:25,682
or anything called Lardner?

186
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:31,121
Lardner's Ring?
What is it? What is it?

187
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:41,583
Tell us where it is or we will
take every ring in this village.

188
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:46,425
(It must be some kind of ring tax.)
(Allan's with them.)

189
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:51,145
Leave me alone!

190
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:53,482
I don't know anything.

191
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:58,864
Right, you've had your chance.
Lose the ring

192
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:01,384
or lose the finger.

193
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:05,327
Somebody knows where Lardner is.

194
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:06,707
(Did he say Lardner? )

195
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:08,223
(Does that mean something to you? )

196
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,329
So, when the sand runs out. . .

197
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,583
. .the finger. . .comes off!

198
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,568
Much, when we were in the Holy Land,

199
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:24,426
do you remember
anybody called Lardner?

200
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:27,024
No. Why? Because I have to find him.

201
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,942
Where's, er. . .
Where's Will and Djaq?

202
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,907
They said
they've gone to get some honey.

203
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:36,287
They'll be back soon.

204
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:40,545
If that's what they've gone for.
But why does it need two of them?

205
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:43,463
Hm? Honey is one of those things.

206
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,549
What things?
What do you call it when you use

207
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:49,485
a sweet innocent word but what
you really mean is something else?

208
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:52,926
A lie. No.
A euphemism?

209
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,159
A euphemism.

210
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,127
Exactly!

211
00:14:56,119 --> 00:15:00,203
Yes. There's a bit too much honey
going on around here if you ask me.

212
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,622
Will and Djaq nipping off together.

213
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:04,769
You two going
for long walks in the forest.

214
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:05,805
He's jealous.

215
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:10,759
What happened
to fighting for justice and
rebelling against the Sheriff?

216
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:13,330
We should be sticking together!

217
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:15,890
Instead,
we're splitting into couples.

218
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:17,449
To be perfectly honest. . .

219
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,699
. .I don't fancy mine much.

220
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:25,483
Anyway, while you two
have been off gallivanting. . .

221
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:27,640
We haven't been gallivanting!

222
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:29,129
I know what you've been up to.

223
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:31,360
We've been burying
a corpse in the forest.

224
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:36,339
Is that a euphemism?

225
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,886
Speak now
and spare this woman's finger.

226
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,202
Say nothing and
your silence proves your guilt.

227
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,088
Can we risk it? Yeah, we have to.

228
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,048
I'll take him the long way round,
lead him away from camp.

229
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,324
Stop!

230
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:58,368
I know who Lardner is.

231
00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:01,487
And I know about his ring.

232
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:05,688
Let the woman go. You're
in Robin Hood's gang, aren't you?
Let the woman go!

233
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:12,850
Now. . .tell me about Lardner.

234
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:16,200
You'll have to catch us first!

235
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:17,723
Get after 'em!

236
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:06,567
That way!

237
00:17:16,639 --> 00:17:19,324
Whoa! Whoa! Hold there, horsey!

238
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:27,679
Or it was.

239
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:33,400
Robin?

240
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:37,347
What's happened? It's Gisborne. He's
at Locksley, terrorising the people.

241
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:39,102
What?

242
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,523
He's searching for Lardner's Ring.

243
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:47,786
Ah, Gisborne The Gullible.
I've got something to show you.

244
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:51,067
First you see it, then you don't.

245
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:53,289
There it is. And there it isn't.

246
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,769
What's your point?

247
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:58,539
How did you do that?

248
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:04,227
You simply pull up on the handle,
the claw grabs hold of the bird.

249
00:18:04,219 --> 00:18:06,642
You lift up the lid,
the bird's gone.

250
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:12,546
The cooked bird has been
hollowed out, you put a live dove

251
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:16,339
inside it and lah di dah di dah. . .
A plate full of bird's wings.

252
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:20,821
Hm? Your Fool, he's no sorcerer,
he's no soothsayer.

253
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:23,105
And he cannot predict the future.

254
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:25,442
He was right about
Lardner's Ring though.

255
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:26,906
Bring 'em in!

256
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:39,743
Back home, my uncle had a friend.

257
00:18:39,739 --> 00:18:43,106
The Sultan's
official pigeon handler.

258
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:44,669
He handles pigeons?

259
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:46,627
Yes, he handles pigeons.

260
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:48,348
Ajob, I suppose.

261
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:51,319
It's a very important job, Much!

262
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:56,185
Now, the Sultan's very best pigeon -

263
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:58,604
the smallest

264
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,707
and quickest one,

265
00:19:00,699 --> 00:19:04,260
was a pigeon called Lardner.

266
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:06,580
Right.

267
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:08,779
Right.

268
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:10,110
Does he have a ring?

269
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:13,944
And if he does,
what's so special about it?

270
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:16,590
The Saracens use
pigeons to carry messages.

271
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:21,528
They put the message on a little
ring tied to the bird's foot
and then they let it fly off.

272
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:26,263
It doesn't matter how far away the
bird is when you let it go, because
it will always find its way home.

273
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:28,841
Carrying the message with it.

274
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:31,899
But it isn't their home
they are searching for.

275
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:33,139
It is their mate.

276
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:39,148
All you have to do
is split the two of them up.

277
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:43,599
And a pigeon will carry a message
to the ends of the Earth, faster and

278
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:49,868
straighter than any man ever could,
just to be with the one they love.

279
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:55,685
So we could get a message to
King Richard, half away across
the world, in no time at all?

280
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,340
A matter of days.

281
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:00,699
That's incredible!

282
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:07,821
My question is,
why is the Sultan's best pigeon
being used by King Richard?

283
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:10,708
Maybe they've formed an alliance
or something.

284
00:20:10,699 --> 00:20:16,387
Or maybe King Richard
and his army have helped themselves.

285
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:18,984
If they've got Lardner, they've

286
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:20,981
got the Sultan.

287
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:24,749
And if they've got the Sultan,

288
00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:26,343
they've got everyone.

289
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:36,241
We have to go back to the tree.

290
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:38,503
So that's what he had in his box.

291
00:20:38,499 --> 00:20:41,104
And the only place he
could've left it is up that tree.

292
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:45,240
You make me sick, you know that?
Betraying your old friends.

293
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:48,504
I hope you're enjoying it, Allan.
I couldn't live with myself.

294
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:51,081
Ah well, you won't have to
for much longer, you see.

295
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:54,082
The penalty for
being in Robin Hood's gang is death!

296
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:00,429
Right, well. I'm glad I
could have been of service, I think
my work here is done. Can I go now?

297
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:05,061
You can go, of course. With him,
to the gallows. Hang them both!

298
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:08,608
And feed their carcasses
to the birds.

299
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:11,864
Come along, Gisborne.
No time to lose.

300
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:15,602
No, please. Have mercy.
Don't let them do this to me! Hey.

301
00:21:21,499 --> 00:21:25,321
Please. Well, seeing you swing
will be comedy, won't it?

302
00:21:26,739 --> 00:21:28,320
Very good.

303
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:39,899
If Robin gets the bird,
it means the King knows our plans.

304
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:46,623
And the last thing we need is the
King and his army coming back to
England before we're ready for them.

305
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:50,259
So we must catch the pigeon.

306
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:52,921
Catch the pigeon now.

307
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:02,828
But if we wait for Will
then we can all go together!

308
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:05,947
We have to go now. Come on.
And if Allan returns with more men?

309
00:22:05,939 --> 00:22:10,023
John, if they knew where
Lardner was, they wouldn't
have terrorised the village.

310
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:12,499
We won't be long. Work on
the message until we get back.

311
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:13,579
Now give me the rope.

312
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:15,069
Good luck.

313
00:22:45,579 --> 00:22:49,265
Do you think a bird could
fly that distance and still
find its way home?

314
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:52,342
The dove found its
way back to Noah's Ark.

315
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:56,220
How do they do it?

316
00:22:56,219 --> 00:22:58,028
They just follow their hearts.

317
00:23:04,219 --> 00:23:06,619
Won't be long.

318
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:09,463
You take your time. No rush.

319
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:12,906
Do you think that contraption's
strong enough to hold the two of us?

320
00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:15,060
Last a lifetime, that will.

321
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,459
Huh-heh! At least your lifetime!

322
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:21,025
I could do your job.

323
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:22,862
(I couldn't do yours.)

324
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:49,201
Can you see it?

325
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:51,605
That's it, I think.

326
00:23:56,999 --> 00:23:58,785
Can you reach it?

327
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:00,406
I'm nearly there.

328
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:10,088
Robin! Robin, the Sheriff's coming.

329
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:17,189
And Gisborne's with him!

330
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:21,988
Run!

331
00:24:21,979 --> 00:24:25,324
Go without me! I'll hold them off!

332
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:31,647
Hang on, stop.

333
00:24:31,939 --> 00:24:33,383
Yeah, that's the tree.

334
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:51,026
You're surrounded, Hood!

335
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:52,429
You're going nowhere!

336
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:54,705
Get back on your horse
and get reinforcements!

337
00:24:59,259 --> 00:25:01,227
What are you doing here?

338
00:25:01,219 --> 00:25:02,982
Hiding.

339
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:04,708
Great(!)

340
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:08,861
He could just wait until it gets
dark and then release the bird.

341
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:10,827
He'll be down before nightfall.

342
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:16,587
"Come home."
No, it needs more immediacy.

343
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:19,389
"Come home now".
"Come home immediately!"

344
00:25:20,939 --> 00:25:23,464
"Immediately" is better.
"Immediately" is longer.

345
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:27,259
What? ! Lardner's a pigeon, not
an eagle. More words, more weight.

346
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,659
It's one word. Same as "now"!

347
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:32,583
Well, then use "now"!
Too many cooks!

348
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:39,566
You know, traditionally,
men in your position offer men
in our position a last request?

349
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:41,402
I don't hold with tradition.

350
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:45,142
It's just a little thing. Would you
scratch my nose? I've got an itch.

351
00:25:45,139 --> 00:25:47,448
Let the Devil scratch it.

352
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:50,169
You'll see him soon enough.

353
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,229
Sir Guy's got Robin
Hood trapped up a tree.

354
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:55,302
He wants every available
man down there now!

355
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:58,143
Get your horses!
Quick! One last chance.

356
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:02,508
While no-one's looking,
let us go and we'll say
no more about it, yeah?

357
00:26:03,139 --> 00:26:04,367
I'm a performer!

358
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:06,907
I can't die without an audience.

359
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,141
It's an insult to my profession.

360
00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:12,903
I told you to keep
an eye on that belt.

361
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:19,760
Marian, they don't know
you're up here. If I make a run
for it, they'll follow me.

362
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:22,227
You can escape with Lardner.
They're coming back!

363
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:30,349
Ugh! Uh!

364
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:47,168
That is a complete waste of arrows.

365
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,525
Just giving Allan
something to think about.

366
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:51,589
Think about
us running out of arrows.

367
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:53,342
Look! Look, they're retreating.

368
00:26:57,879 --> 00:26:59,449
I have an idea.

369
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:01,703
Do not let them
escape while I'm gone.

370
00:27:01,699 --> 00:27:04,748
He'll be dead by the
time you get back.
I won't hold my breath.

371
00:27:11,459 --> 00:27:14,007
Maybe you could use me as a hostage.

372
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,945
What?
You know Gisborne's feelings for me.

373
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:20,443
He might let you go, if
he thought it meant getting me back.

374
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:24,626
Are you mad? I could say
I was on my way home to him
and you ambushed me in the forest.

375
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:26,883
He'd never fall for it!

376
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:30,167
And how would that look? Robin
Hood takes Lady Marian hostage!

377
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,980
Oh, yes, us dying
together might look better(!)

378
00:27:32,979 --> 00:27:37,279
But it won't bring the King home.
Even if Gisborne fell
for it, the Sheriff wouldn't.

379
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,348
The Sheriff's gone!

380
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:42,207
And while Gisborne's in charge. . .
Robin this could be our last chance.

381
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:43,780
No! It's not happening.

382
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:47,545
Robin, have you got a better idea?

383
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:52,289
Right. "Your Majesty.

384
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:54,008
"No reinforcements.

385
00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:56,206
"John plans to steal your throne. . ."

386
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:58,247
"Plots."

387
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:02,107
"Plots" is a better word.
"Plots" is better.

388
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:05,803
"Your Majesty.

389
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:07,482
"No reinforcements.

390
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:10,403
"John plots to steal your throne.

391
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,900
"Come home, now."

392
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,039
Short, sharp and to the point.

393
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,563
I'll add "make peace"

394
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,129
before "come home".

395
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:23,168
"Make peace immediately."

396
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,606
Ah! You know,
I do like "immediately".

397
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:28,920
But it needs more emotion.

398
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:30,887
Make it bigger! Raise the stakes!

399
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:34,485
And alliterate! Alliteration
makes it much more memorable.

400
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,879
Where have you come from?

401
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:38,403
I appear. I disappear.

402
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,244
It's what I do. To tell how would
spoil the illusion.

403
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:43,809
He's with me.

404
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:46,688
I thought you'd been caught.

405
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:49,466
Madam, manacles are
mere mist to myself and my. . .

406
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,162
. . my mate.

407
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,524
You know about the pigeon?

408
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:55,749
Yes, Robin and Marian
have gone to get him.

409
00:28:55,739 --> 00:28:57,366
So have Sheriff and Gisborne.

410
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,408
They've got them trapped
up a tree surrounded.

411
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,981
We need to go. Now!

412
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:04,606
Immediately!

413
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:09,008
OK, line up!

414
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:12,960
You, over there!

415
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,029
Let's get him down! Come on! Line up!

416
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:44,368
Saddle me up another horse -
make it a fast one.

417
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,883
I'll be leaving shortly.

418
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:55,207
It's just a matter of time now
Hood, start saying your prayers.

419
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:59,465
If they come any nearer,
they'll get the same.
And I won't be aiming at their feet!

420
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:04,763
Give me your arrows.
It's not enough.

421
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:07,739
Well, they don't know that, do they?

422
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,627
Ready? Yeah.

423
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:11,041
Move!

424
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:20,439
I'll scream, then I can say
you were holding me hostage.

425
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:22,703
You didn't scream earlier.
He's not stupid.

426
00:30:22,699 --> 00:30:24,849
I'll deal with this, Marian.

427
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:29,680
It'll take them hours
to cut down this tree.

428
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,762
And in that time, the gang
will realise something's wrong.

429
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:35,159
Yeah? They'll come and help.

430
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:37,002
Come, come.

431
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:39,103
That's it, stop.

432
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:43,403
I can't hear an axe.

433
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:45,606
What are they waiting for?

434
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:53,927
You know what that is, don't you?

435
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,103
It's pitch.

436
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:58,920
It burns hot and it burns fast.

437
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:05,102
Go, go, go!

438
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:13,522
Much, I think it's this way.
You think?!

439
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,043
Shhh!

440
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,963
Don't tell me to shush!
We're looking for a tree in a forest!

441
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,564
Shut up and listen!

442
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,880
I hope you're ready, Hood!

443
00:31:22,879 --> 00:31:24,642
I'm sensing it's that way.

444
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,301
You tried to cover me in pitch
once, Hood, do you remember?

445
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:37,148
Tried to cover me alive
in my own armour. Yeah!

446
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:39,619
I should have gone through with it!

447
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:41,359
Talking trees are good.

448
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,930
But burning bushes are better.

449
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:48,747
I don't see a trough of
water for you to jump into.

450
00:31:48,739 --> 00:31:52,630
If I were bound and gagged
I couldn't scream,
so all we have to do. . .

451
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,883
No! There's no other way!

452
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:03,181
There's always another way.

453
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:05,181
Shields!

454
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:07,784
This is just putting
off the inevitable.

455
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:10,589
You're not going back to him.
I can do more good in the castle.

456
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:13,946
Marian, I would rather die
here than have you go back. . .

457
00:32:13,939 --> 00:32:17,363
But if you die now,
my father died for nothing.

458
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,790
Trust me, I'll get us out of this.
No, you won't!

459
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:25,462
Not without my help.

460
00:32:25,459 --> 00:32:28,269
Look, we're in this together.

461
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:30,648
Now, tie me up.

462
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:35,019
Right, listen to me. He's only
got two choices now. Run or burn.

463
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,305
Either way he's finished.

464
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:41,429
And any bird that leaves those leaves
dies in the sky.

465
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:43,819
There are too many of them.

466
00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:48,062
What are we going to do?
After "three" open the shield wall.

467
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,344
One.

468
00:32:51,699 --> 00:32:52,802
Two.

469
00:32:57,699 --> 00:32:58,700
Three!

470
00:33:10,219 --> 00:33:11,743
SHE GROANS

471
00:33:12,979 --> 00:33:14,901
Gisborne!

472
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:18,699
If I die, Marian dies!

473
00:33:18,699 --> 00:33:22,180
No! Move! Marian!

474
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,482
So it's true.

475
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:30,390
You still love her.

476
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:33,303
I've found your weakness, Gisborne.

477
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:37,008
If you harm a single hair on her
head, I swear I will kill you!

478
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:41,459
You'll die more slowly and more
painfully than any man
has ever died before!

479
00:33:41,459 --> 00:33:43,461
Well, I thought that was the point!

480
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:48,146
No. It would have been relatively
quick and painless. You let me go,
I'll leave her behind.

481
00:33:48,139 --> 00:33:50,266
Untouched.

482
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:54,223
I'll think about it.

483
00:33:58,059 --> 00:34:01,187
Everybody back! Move!

484
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:05,428
Well. . .that bought us some time.

485
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,887
Any ideas? We need to make
Robin and Marian disappear.

486
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,801
how do we do that?

487
00:34:12,799 --> 00:34:15,461
A puff of smoke.

488
00:34:15,459 --> 00:34:17,700
Be careful.

489
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,483
Are you all right?

490
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:23,344
I won't leave you behind.

491
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:25,443
But we can make him
think that I will.

492
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:29,261
So now we can all see the famous
Robin Hood for who he really is.

493
00:34:29,259 --> 00:34:33,844
A common coward
using an innocent woman as a hostage.

494
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:38,003
She's not an innocent,
she's one of you lot!

495
00:34:37,999 --> 00:34:41,583
A pampered parasite
living off the backs of the poor.

496
00:34:43,939 --> 00:34:45,361
(It's nothing personal.)

497
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,329
You can't hide behind her skirts
for ever. Come and fight like a man.

498
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:51,765
Remove your soldiers, Gisborne!

499
00:34:51,759 --> 00:34:55,923
Or she dies at sundown!

500
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:58,570
He wouldn't do that, would he?

501
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:00,800
He's bluffing. This is a siege.

502
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:03,029
All I have to do is wait.

503
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:05,089
Well, you can't wait too long,
though.

504
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:07,559
As soon as the Sheriff
gets back, she's gonna die.

505
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:16,366
Ready?

506
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,706
Let's go.

507
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,984
The forest's on fire.

508
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:51,631
It's a smoke screen.

509
00:35:51,622 --> 00:35:53,510
You, you and you! Find the fire!

510
00:35:53,502 --> 00:35:55,709
Put it out!
His men are in the forest.

511
00:35:55,702 --> 00:35:57,829
Surround the tree. Move!

512
00:35:59,982 --> 00:36:03,270
Make sure you see the man on
either side of you at all times.

513
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,350
Right, close in the circle,
move in!

514
00:36:14,582 --> 00:36:15,606
(Yes!)

515
00:36:15,602 --> 00:36:17,945
I know what you're doing, Hood,
and it won't work.

516
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:21,332
We're ready for you.
Ready and waiting.

517
00:36:25,262 --> 00:36:27,389
It's from Will.

518
00:36:27,382 --> 00:36:28,724
He's got a plan.

519
00:36:29,922 --> 00:36:31,105
Here.

520
00:36:39,122 --> 00:36:40,862
Good. Horses.

521
00:36:40,862 --> 00:36:42,466
LITTLE JOHN WHISTLES

522
00:36:45,022 --> 00:36:47,263
You'll have to put
your arms around me.

523
00:36:47,262 --> 00:36:54,304
No, I'm not coming. Marian,
we haven't got time for this!

524
00:36:54,302 --> 00:36:57,749
I'm staying here
until you get away safely.

525
00:36:58,902 --> 00:37:01,632
This is about Gisborne, isn't it?

526
00:37:01,622 --> 00:37:03,624
No.

527
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:07,069
Inside us, we both
know we belong together.

528
00:37:07,062 --> 00:37:11,249
And being apart will tear me apart
but I'm more use in the castle.

529
00:37:11,242 --> 00:37:13,312
I can protect you better from there.

530
00:37:13,302 --> 00:37:15,748
It's our only hope.

531
00:37:15,742 --> 00:37:18,063
Trust me.

532
00:37:21,382 --> 00:37:24,146
Give me your hand.

533
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:26,269
No. Just give me your hand.

534
00:37:26,262 --> 00:37:27,752
Is this a trick?

535
00:37:36,062 --> 00:37:37,552
It's an engagement ring.

536
00:37:45,302 --> 00:37:48,044
This afternoon we had a plan.

537
00:37:48,042 --> 00:37:50,784
Yes, find Lardner
and bring the King home.

538
00:37:50,782 --> 00:37:55,367
Defeat the Sheriff and get
married - in that order, Robin.

539
00:37:55,362 --> 00:38:00,208
First things first.
This isn't what I want to do.

540
00:38:00,202 --> 00:38:02,272
It's what I have to do.

541
00:38:05,582 --> 00:38:08,426
I love you. I love you too.

542
00:38:37,602 --> 00:38:40,412
Let's just get out of here.
Has Will got everything? Yes.

543
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:42,643
Help! Somebody please help me!

544
00:38:42,642 --> 00:38:45,406
Robin's gone. Get after him.

545
00:38:45,402 --> 00:38:48,166
Do not let him release that bird.

546
00:38:48,162 --> 00:38:50,813
50 to the man who kills the pigeon.

547
00:38:50,802 --> 00:38:55,762
He's left me up here
to die, help me! Please!

548
00:38:55,762 --> 00:38:58,344
Is the note ready? Yeah.

549
00:38:58,342 --> 00:39:00,128
Where's Marian? She's fine.

550
00:39:00,122 --> 00:39:04,365
Just get out of here and don't
let that bird go until you're
out of range, all right?

551
00:39:10,002 --> 00:39:11,606
SHE GROANS

552
00:39:14,082 --> 00:39:16,243
Marian, I'm coming! Marian. . .

553
00:39:18,922 --> 00:39:22,210
Nearly there. Marian, hold on!

554
00:39:22,202 --> 00:39:26,810
SHE WHIMPERS: Hurry up!

555
00:39:31,042 --> 00:39:33,488
It's all right, I've got you.

556
00:39:33,482 --> 00:39:35,006
I've got you.

557
00:39:37,602 --> 00:39:39,263
You're coming home with me.

558
00:39:41,702 --> 00:39:43,442
(You're safe now.)

559
00:39:50,002 --> 00:39:51,003
Release the bird!

560
00:39:51,002 --> 00:39:52,503
Release it!

561
00:40:21,122 --> 00:40:22,726
Come on!

562
00:40:36,022 --> 00:40:37,523
And fetch.

563
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:16,203
Cheer up.

564
00:41:16,202 --> 00:41:18,966
What have I got to be cheery about?
Well, we've got a visitor.

565
00:41:22,702 --> 00:41:25,591
Him!

566
00:41:25,582 --> 00:41:27,607
It's Lardner. Say hello.

567
00:41:28,742 --> 00:41:29,868
You're joking?

568
00:41:30,902 --> 00:41:36,351
When you want something to
disappear, the trick is to
divert the audience attention.

569
00:41:36,342 --> 00:41:40,108
He switched the birds.
I Just happened to have
a spare stuck up my sleeve.

570
00:41:40,102 --> 00:41:43,390
Should've attached a verse
of the note to the decoy bird.

571
00:41:43,382 --> 00:41:45,964
Nah. Would've just weighed him down.

572
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:50,467
Um. Yes, speaking of decoy birds,
is Marian all right with Gisborne?

573
00:41:50,462 --> 00:41:53,306
Yeah, she'll be fine.

574
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,805
She can look after herself.

575
00:41:58,162 --> 00:42:01,507
Well, hey.
Do you want to do the honours?

576
00:42:01,502 --> 00:42:03,390
At least we have some hope now.

577
00:42:03,382 --> 00:42:05,270
Yeah.

578
00:42:05,262 --> 00:42:06,752
Thanks to Lardner.

579
00:42:08,382 --> 00:42:10,589
Good luck, my friend,

580
00:42:10,582 --> 00:42:12,868
and safe journey home.

581
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:34,223
The Sheriff's missing.
Missing? Find him.

582
00:42:34,222 --> 00:42:36,383
Nottingham is about to be flattened.

583
00:42:36,382 --> 00:42:40,546
I don't think Robin Hood is the
problem. He might be the solution.

584
00:42:40,542 --> 00:42:42,351
Ask.

585
00:42:42,342 --> 00:42:43,388
Nooooo!

586
00:42:43,382 --> 00:42:46,033
Marry me now.
And make it the last thing we do.

587
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:48,752
Who are you?
I am the man with the plan.

588
00:42:48,742 --> 00:42:51,267
The Sheriff is heading for the camp.
It's time. . .

589
00:42:51,262 --> 00:42:52,308
Get those gates open!

590
00:42:54,582 --> 00:42:56,630
They're coming, they're coming! !
