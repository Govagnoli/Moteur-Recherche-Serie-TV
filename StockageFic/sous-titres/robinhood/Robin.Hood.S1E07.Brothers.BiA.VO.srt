1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,900
Now. Good people of Locksley, I have bad
news. Ah, but there is good news as well.

2
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:15,900
OK, now the bad news is the Sheriff's taxman
is in Clun. It's not far and he'll be here soon.

3
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:21,901
But the good news is I, me, Lucky George,
I'm here with you in Locksley.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,902
Now, I will give you good hard cash
for any jewelry,

5
00:00:26,903 --> 00:00:30,403
trinkets, anything of value,
I will turn to pennies.

6
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:34,404
Those pennies will pay the taxman
and that will keep you out of the Sheriff's jail.

7
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:37,405
So help me to help you.

8
00:00:37,406 --> 00:00:40,406
Be lucky, come to Lucky George.

9
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:43,907
We should have gone round,
I hate these woods.

10
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,408
This, my friends, is an ambush.

11
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:07,009
Come to exchange some valuables for cash?

12
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,910
Lucky George loves a deal.

13
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:10,410
A deal with the Sheriff?

14
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:13,211
Oh, now why would you say that?

15
00:01:13,212 --> 00:01:18,412
I'm sorry, George, your luck's run out.
I'm closing down your business.

16
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,414
With my sword at your throat?
I don't think so!

17
00:01:23,415 --> 00:01:26,715
- Call your men off.
- No, I don't think so.

18
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:29,917
You're surrounded.
Ah, keep your hands up!

19
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,919
If that's what you want...

20
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,420
Oi, come here!

21
00:01:56,621 --> 00:01:57,621
Now, look, lads.

22
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,622
Only joking.

23
00:02:06,823 --> 00:02:09,623
Let's see if he's lucky enough
to make his own way home.

24
00:02:09,624 --> 00:02:11,424
Take everything.

25
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,625
We are putting this parasite
out of business.

EPISODE 7
"BROTHER IN ARMS"

28
00:03:08,628 --> 00:03:10,928
Oi, stop!
Megan, what are you doing?

29
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:13,629
We're giving these a good horse whipping.

30
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,730
Why?

31
00:03:14,731 --> 00:03:19,731
Said they were thatchers. Said they'd fix
the hole on the roof, then they stole this.

32
00:03:20,832 --> 00:03:24,232
Me mother gave it to me on my wedding day.
It's the only thing of value I own.

33
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:27,733
Lucky George offered me thruppence
but I'd never sell.

34
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:30,234
You touch us and you'll be in big trouble!

35
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:32,235
We are Robin Hood's men!

36
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:36,536
- Maybe if you try wearing a dress?
- I will if you will.

37
00:03:36,537 --> 00:03:40,537
Robin Hood could swing out of these trees
any time and bash your brains out.

38
00:03:40,538 --> 00:03:46,138
- Or are you afraid of looking too pretty.
- I know that voice.

39
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:49,839
Oh, surely Robin Hood couldn't
take on all of us?

40
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,840
Robin Hood wouldn't be scared of you.

41
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:54,841
You're girls compared to him and his men.

42
00:03:54,842 --> 00:03:57,142
- Tom?
- Allan!

43
00:03:57,843 --> 00:03:59,943
- You know him?
- He's my brother.

44
00:03:59,944 --> 00:04:01,644
Thank heavens you're here.

45
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:07,445
My purse? My sword?
My horse?

46
00:04:07,446 --> 00:04:10,641
I can explain.
My nose !

47
00:04:10,676 --> 00:04:14,846
What kind of thing is that to do
to your brother! Is this broken?

48
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,950
I say whip him to within an inch of his life.

49
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:20,851
If you touch me again Robin Hood will string
you up from the tallest oak in Sherwood forest!

50
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:25,552
This is Robin Hood, you idiot!

51
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:30,653
We beg your forgiveness,
Robin of Locksley.

52
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:36,254
We are humble thatchers. Times are hard,
we had to thieve or else face starvation.

53
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:40,355
My friends here,
I have to look after them.

54
00:04:40,356 --> 00:04:42,456
Don't believe a word.

55
00:04:42,557 --> 00:04:47,657
Please! Have a heart.
Help us out here. We'll work for you.

56
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,458
We could join your band of worthy outlaws.

57
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,459
- What do you two have to say?
- They can't speak, Lord.
They've had their tongues cut out.

58
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,460
Why?

59
00:04:58,461 --> 00:05:01,461
For praising your work.
They were overheard.

60
00:05:05,662 --> 00:05:07,662
Let them go.

61
00:05:09,163 --> 00:05:14,663
You have your necklace. We are not
the Sheriff, we do not horse-whip thieves.

62
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:22,264
- Are you really thatchers?
- Course. The finest in all England.

63
00:05:22,265 --> 00:05:25,920
You shall have a new roof! Free of charge.

64
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:28,967
By the way, I found some lost
property in the forest.

65
00:05:29,768 --> 00:05:32,368
Anyone lost any valuables recently?

66
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:35,949
Take what is yours.
Courtesy of Lucky George.

67
00:05:35,984 --> 00:05:37,970
If I'd known I would've sold
this necklace this morning.

68
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:46,428
I think we could be useful to you.
See, did you notice?

69
00:05:47,073 --> 00:05:50,203
If I can steal something
from under the nose of the great Robin Hood,

70
00:05:50,238 --> 00:05:52,792
think what I can achieve
of mere mortals, eh?

71
00:05:52,827 --> 00:05:54,075
Allan?

72
00:05:57,794 --> 00:06:00,106
He's an excellent pickpocket.

73
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:02,677
He's got a big mouth, I know,
but his heart is in the right place.

74
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:03,978
And he's your brother.

75
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:06,679
If you had a brother who'd done something
wrong, you'd give him a chance, wouldn't you?

76
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,111
Thank you, Robin.
You will not regret it.

77
00:06:18,146 --> 00:06:21,782
You will earn these tags.
You are on probation.

78
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:29,183
Why are you still standing there?
This woman's roof.

79
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:30,884
- Get to it.
- Go on!

80
00:06:34,386 --> 00:06:35,386
I'll keep an eye on him.

81
00:06:38,887 --> 00:06:40,387
My necklace is now yours, Eleri.

82
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:49,067
- <i>These two wanted to see you, sir.</i>
- I'm late as it is.

83
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:51,463
What do you want?

84
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:54,570
We seek your blessing
and permission to marry, my lord.

85
00:06:56,366 --> 00:06:59,540
And what are you prepared to pay
for my blessing and permission?

86
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:06,738
Come closer. Just you.

87
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:14,825
Nice.

88
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,677
This?

89
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:23,241
My mother gave it to us
as a token on our engagement.

90
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,477
It's the only thing of value I have in my family.

91
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:29,210
That'll do nicely.

92
00:07:29,345 --> 00:07:30,954
Turn around.

93
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,140
It's an outrage! An innocent man robbed...

94
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:50,384
...whilst going about his legitimate business!

95
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:52,910
- I need more guards.
- Out of the question.

96
00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:54,725
You shall have them.

97
00:07:54,896 --> 00:08:00,131
About half a dozen should do.
Oh, I need a new carriage an' all.

98
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:03,768
Of course. See to it, Gisborne.

99
00:08:11,603 --> 00:08:16,162
The man's worth his weight in gold. Hm?
He makes a profit, we get our taxes.

100
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:19,785
It's good. A public-private-partnership.

101
00:08:19,938 --> 00:08:22,643
What happened, Gisborne?

102
00:08:23,855 --> 00:08:27,654
Robin Hood must have known
George's whereabouts.

103
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:33,810
Only once, once, he risked the forest and
immediately he's robbed. Coincidence? Clue: no.

104
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,754
Hood knows more about
our business than we do.

105
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,874
The question is...

106
00:08:39,638 --> 00:08:41,410
how?

107
00:08:41,476 --> 00:08:44,653
- I don't know.
- Well, I do.

108
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:48,967
We have a spy amongst us.

109
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,407
And do you know what we have to do
to catch a spy?

110
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:55,515
- No.
- I do.

111
00:08:56,121 --> 00:09:02,614
I set a trap. Or rather, you set a trap.

112
00:09:10,405 --> 00:09:11,705
That's it. That's the lot.

113
00:09:13,263 --> 00:09:16,819
Where 's Lucky George's money?
Where 's the coins?

114
00:09:16,854 --> 00:09:19,847
We searched his pockets. Nothing.

115
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:23,177
- How can he trade if he has no money?
- Maybe he spent it all?

116
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:24,473
That's unlikely.

117
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:32,363
Thing is... I woke up and we'd both been robbed.
And rather than wake you I went
off to catch the thieves myself.

118
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,378
I chased them for days...

119
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:37,059
Couldn't tell the truth if
his life depended on it.

120
00:09:37,094 --> 00:09:40,960
- Runs in the family, then.
- Don't make us gang up on you.

121
00:09:40,995 --> 00:09:45,430
- Is he disrespecting our family?
- You rob each other in your family!

122
00:09:46,774 --> 00:09:48,512
My flask.

123
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:51,260
Where 's my flask?

124
00:09:51,595 --> 00:09:53,625
I put it there, where is it?

125
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,721
Sorry! Old habits...

126
00:10:05,622 --> 00:10:07,222
The old gang back together.

127
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,200
How did they lose their tongues? No lies.

128
00:10:12,602 --> 00:10:14,002
For spitting at some guards.

129
00:10:16,402 --> 00:10:20,402
It'll be different this time.
I won't let you down again. I promise.

130
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:38,303
- Do you like it?
- Yes, I do but...

131
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,705
It's simple silver.

132
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:44,406
You have no need of gold or gaudy jewels.

133
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:46,407
But really. I cannot accept it.

134
00:10:47,408 --> 00:10:49,408
Why not?

135
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:52,409
Have I insulted you?

136
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:58,310
You do not like it.
It's too plain, too simple. Take it off.

137
00:10:58,312 --> 00:10:59,912
No, l-I like it.

138
00:11:00,714 --> 00:11:02,714
I will treasure it.

139
00:11:02,715 --> 00:11:06,815
- It is a gift of friendship.
- And I am very grateful.

140
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:11,417
You wanted to see me, sir?

141
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,718
Cancel the guard for
the consignment from Rotherham.

142
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:22,819
- No guards?
- No guards.

143
00:11:22,821 --> 00:11:24,421
Guards attract attention.

144
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:26,150
Why would we want to
attract attention...

145
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,515
- to a chest full of silver traveling
through Sherwood Forest?

146
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,322
Yes, sir.

147
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:34,723
And tell no one.
No one.

148
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:38,825
- Not even the guards themselves.
- Yes, sir.

149
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:46,826
Good morning, Nettlestone!

150
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:50,227
Look at that! 'Ey, you know me. Come to
Lucky, Lucky George. I know you...

151
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:55,228
I thought we had put him out of business!

152
00:11:57,229 --> 00:11:59,229
Look at this.

153
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,830
- Where does he get his money from?
- They sell everything. Why?

154
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:08,932
Word 's got round. Robin will
return their goods, just like he did before.

155
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:23,933
I tell you what. I will give you, for that...
I wish you no harm.

156
00:12:27,134 --> 00:12:28,934
But I will relieve you of your valuables.

157
00:12:31,435 --> 00:12:35,196
Sorry. I thought you were a rich noblewoman...

158
00:12:35,197 --> 00:12:38,036
...looking to donate your fancy
jewels to a good cause.

159
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:39,736
You knew it was me.

160
00:12:40,137 --> 00:12:42,937
You shouldn't be riding alone through the forest.

161
00:12:42,938 --> 00:12:48,038
There are some very unsavory
characters about. Outlaws, you know.

162
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:51,939
- What's this?
- Don't touch.

163
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,240
It's very pretty.
Have I seen it before?

164
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,642
- No. It was a gift.
- From whom?

165
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,944
Does it matter?
I should be going.

166
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:03,105
I don't know. Does it?

167
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:04,607
No.

168
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:07,608
- Gisborne.
- What?

169
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,410
- Just a guess. Am I right?
- As it happens.

170
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:13,912
- Interesting.
- Why interesting?

171
00:13:14,014 --> 00:13:18,014
I have seen it before. Around the
neck of a young girl from Locksley.

172
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:21,015
It was given to her by her mother.

173
00:13:21,616 --> 00:13:26,016
- Yes, and?
- And here it is around your neck.

174
00:13:27,618 --> 00:13:29,018
Gisborne stole it from the girl?

175
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:32,019
I can't imagine she gave it to him willingly.

176
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,200
But it's not like you stole it
from the poor girl yourself.

177
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:37,901
And you obviously like it.

178
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:42,102
And it is certainly a special and thoughtful gift
from a man that clearly means a lot to you.

179
00:13:42,703 --> 00:13:45,803
- Take it back to the girl.
- Gladly.

180
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:50,605
- What will you say to Gisborne?
- Ask her not to wear it in public.

181
00:13:50,607 --> 00:13:52,807
He will never know.

182
00:13:55,608 --> 00:13:57,508
Keep the necklace.

183
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:02,109
- I can find her another.
- It was a gift from her mother.

184
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:03,811
Take it.

185
00:14:03,812 --> 00:14:06,512
I can handle Gisborne.

186
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:25,413
It's time we got to work, boys. Let's hit the road.

187
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,514
- Why did you go to Gisborne?
- He is our master now.

188
00:14:36,516 --> 00:14:37,416
And what about this?

189
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:40,117
He took it as his fee for our wedding.
How did you...

190
00:14:40,118 --> 00:14:42,118
Doesn't matter.

191
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:45,019
You still want to marry?

192
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,320
- Well, then let me marry you.
- Does that count?

193
00:14:47,322 --> 00:14:51,022
Of course it does. And I am much
cheaper than Gisborne.

194
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:52,623
Here, you should be getting back.

195
00:14:54,624 --> 00:14:56,124
Thank you, Robin.

196
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,725
- Lucky George?
- Nettlestone. More guards. And a new carriage.

197
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:07,027
- So, he is engaged with the Sheriff.
- The villagers are all giving him their stuff.

198
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:09,729
Cheap, because they think
you'll give everything back.

199
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,730
First thing in the morning we find him
and take his toys away.

200
00:15:12,731 --> 00:15:14,731
- For good.
- Robin.

201
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:22,682
I've lost my brother.

202
00:15:22,683 --> 00:15:23,833
It's a big forest.

203
00:15:24,134 --> 00:15:27,634
- They must have gone east.
- He didn't tell me where he was off to though.

204
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:30,136
I've got a bad feeling about this.

205
00:15:30,837 --> 00:15:32,837
Fetch the horses.

206
00:15:32,938 --> 00:15:34,638
East is towards Knighton.

207
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:36,439
Knighton House

208
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,440
Nice house means rich pickings.
Come on.

209
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:46,942
Round the back.

210
00:15:58,443 --> 00:16:00,043
...and the daughter of this house.
Get away from here!

211
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:36,044
Stop!

212
00:16:40,245 --> 00:16:42,245
What is going on?

213
00:16:42,246 --> 00:16:45,946
Thank goodness you're here.
This is Robin Hood, you're in big trouble!

214
00:16:45,948 --> 00:16:47,948
What are you doing?

215
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:49,449
I am so sorry.

216
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,150
These men were robbing my house!

217
00:16:51,151 --> 00:16:54,551
Yes. We're robbing his house!
That's what we do!

218
00:16:54,553 --> 00:16:56,953
We were trying to show the top man
what we can do!

219
00:16:56,954 --> 00:16:58,954
These people are our friends!

220
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:00,355
Now you tell me!

221
00:17:00,456 --> 00:17:01,556
- I thought they were...
- You don't think!

222
00:17:01,557 --> 00:17:03,757
You can't think!

223
00:17:03,758 --> 00:17:05,558
- Are you hurt?
- Only my pride.

224
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,559
These are your men?

225
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,660
Not for much longer. I promise.

226
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:13,461
Apologize!
Apologize for the disturbance.

227
00:17:13,462 --> 00:17:14,462
Now!

228
00:17:14,463 --> 00:17:16,463
Do as you're told.

229
00:17:25,464 --> 00:17:26,664
- Sorry.
- Louder.

230
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,566
- Sorry!
- I knew nothing about this.

231
00:17:30,568 --> 00:17:33,068
They will be punished, you have my word.

232
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:35,969
- Robin, I'm so sorry...
- Just take them away!

233
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,470
There 's a consignment of silver
coming down the Great North Road.

234
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,371
I was on my way to intercept it.

235
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:56,172
- You?
- Yes, me.

236
00:17:56,654 --> 00:18:00,154
It is unguarded so as not to
attract attention. A simple cart.

237
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:03,656
And how do you know this?
Another present from Gisborne?

238
00:18:04,658 --> 00:18:09,158
Look, I need to stay with my father.
If you want it you must hurry.

239
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:10,159
Thank you.

240
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,660
Much, the North Road.

241
00:18:31,161 --> 00:18:32,561
Sorry about that.

242
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:35,361
We arrived as quickly as we could!

243
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:45,662
A decoy. What's the Sheriff up to now?

244
00:18:46,964 --> 00:18:50,964
Well, it looks like
we've all had a wasted journey.

245
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,465
Well done, Gisborne.

246
00:18:57,466 --> 00:19:02,266
Hood wanted silver.
Instead he got this.

247
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:11,467
So...

248
00:19:11,468 --> 00:19:13,168
...who did you tell?

249
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:14,169
My sergeant.

250
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,770
Anyone else?

251
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:18,871
No.

252
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:21,172
You're sure?

253
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:22,773
Only my sergeant. It must be him.

254
00:19:27,774 --> 00:19:29,574
Make him suffer.

255
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,775
Oh, I will.

256
00:19:32,976 --> 00:19:35,676
You know I agreed you should
make up with your brother?

257
00:19:35,777 --> 00:19:37,577
- Yeah?
- I've changed my mind.

258
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:39,779
He was trying to impress you.

259
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,780
And he didn't realize who he was robbing.
It's a big house.

260
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,781
He doesn't think.

261
00:19:44,782 --> 00:19:47,982
Anyway, you don't have to trust them, just me.

262
00:19:47,984 --> 00:19:49,984
- I should have kept an eye on him.
- Yes. You should have.

263
00:19:49,986 --> 00:19:52,486
Look, when have I ever asked you for anything?

264
00:19:52,987 --> 00:19:54,987
All right, apart from saving my life.

265
00:19:56,188 --> 00:19:59,388
He has made a lot of mistakes.
I know, I tried to help him.

266
00:20:00,689 --> 00:20:02,389
Look, I was like him once.

267
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,990
Out of control. But I've changed...

268
00:20:09,192 --> 00:20:10,692
Because of you. Because of being here.

269
00:20:12,193 --> 00:20:14,693
- If you could give him a second chance...
- He's had a second chance.

270
00:20:14,695 --> 00:20:18,395
But if he was with us. With decent men.
He could change.

271
00:20:18,497 --> 00:20:21,530
If I take control, properly...

272
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,899
...you won't have to worry about him.

273
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,100
Please? One more chance?

274
00:20:27,502 --> 00:20:31,202
He stole from you.
And you still defend him.

275
00:20:31,504 --> 00:20:33,504
He's my brother.

276
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:39,305
- One more chance.
- Thank you.

277
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:50,407
Last chance. Do you understand?

278
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:52,509
All right.

279
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,510
Get up!

280
00:20:57,511 --> 00:20:58,511
Get up!

281
00:20:58,512 --> 00:21:02,512
- They've gone.
- And they've taken everything.

282
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:07,669
- Clothes, money, horses.
- Everything.

283
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:11,860
I will kill him. I'm gonna kill him.

284
00:21:11,918 --> 00:21:15,018
Bury him, dig him up and kill him again!

285
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:34,452
In the name of Robin Hood,
hand over the money and we won't harm you.

286
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:37,521
Don't even think about it.

287
00:21:37,522 --> 00:21:40,522
There are six guards relieving
themselves in the forest behind you.

288
00:21:40,523 --> 00:21:44,623
- Do you expect me to believe that?
- Turn around, see for yourself.

289
00:21:44,926 --> 00:21:47,226
Do I look like I was born yesterday?

290
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:09,027
They're to hang.

291
00:22:13,128 --> 00:22:16,028
They have lied to us, stolen from us.

292
00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:19,429
- They're nothing but trouble.
- Let them hang.

293
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:25,831
I agree.

294
00:22:27,832 --> 00:22:29,759
You do?

295
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,333
My brother had more chances than he deserved.

296
00:22:34,434 --> 00:22:36,134
Does he deserve to die?

297
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:38,835
Do we?

298
00:22:40,136 --> 00:22:42,336
If we go to Nottingham
we'll end up joining him on the scaffold.

299
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:46,837
They took some of our tags.
The Sheriff's crowing.

300
00:22:46,939 --> 00:22:49,039
Thinks he's got Robin Hood's men.

301
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,440
Now it's like he's daring us to rescue them.

302
00:22:52,441 --> 00:22:54,441
My brother was never part of this gang, was he?

303
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:59,142
We trusted them and they let us down.
That's it.

304
00:22:59,143 --> 00:23:02,143
We'd be fools to walk into a trap for them.

305
00:23:03,844 --> 00:23:04,844
Does anyone disagree with me?

306
00:23:22,345 --> 00:23:24,645
- What do you want?
- To talk.

307
00:23:24,647 --> 00:23:26,347
- So talk.

308
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:37,148
Ah! You can talk from there.

309
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:40,849
- What?
- Nothing.

310
00:23:41,851 --> 00:23:44,051
- You were looking at me.
- That's just the way my eyes were pointing.

311
00:23:45,553 --> 00:23:47,553
I'm sorry about yesterday.

312
00:23:48,354 --> 00:23:49,354
How's your father?

313
00:23:50,356 --> 00:23:52,356
- I hear your men are going to hang.
- They're not my men.

314
00:23:52,358 --> 00:23:54,358
They were your men last night.

315
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,159
The Sheriff is hanging them in my name,
hoping I'll turn up to rescue them.

316
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:02,161
But my men think it's a trap.

317
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:05,562
Has your good friend Guy of Gisborne
said anything to you?

318
00:24:06,563 --> 00:24:10,563
I think he was a little preoccupied. But I will
go to the castle to see what I can find out.

319
00:24:12,065 --> 00:24:15,065
If I do not rescue them,
people will think I cannot protect my men.

320
00:24:17,066 --> 00:24:18,566
Do I risk us all to save them?

321
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:22,795
You are a good man, Robin.
Nothing will change that.

322
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:30,869
That won't help you make your decision.

323
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,570
- It might.
- It won't.

324
00:24:54,572 --> 00:24:56,572
- Marian.
- Sir Guy.

325
00:24:57,573 --> 00:25:00,573
So you did not like it after all?

326
00:25:02,574 --> 00:25:06,597
- The necklace.
- No, I do. It's at home.

327
00:25:07,076 --> 00:25:08,076
You didn't think to wear it?

328
00:25:08,077 --> 00:25:10,077
It is very precious to me.
I would not want to lose it.

329
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:14,878
Come away. This is not for your ears.

330
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:16,179
What is it?

331
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,080
Do you know the worst crime
a man can commit?

332
00:25:19,481 --> 00:25:21,181
Murder?

333
00:25:21,482 --> 00:25:23,082
Betrayal.

334
00:25:25,283 --> 00:25:29,083
My sergeant swore loyalty to me
and then he stabbed me in the back.

335
00:25:29,084 --> 00:25:32,584
- He hasn't admitted it yet but he will.
- Admit what?

336
00:25:33,086 --> 00:25:35,986
We set a trap to flush out a spy.

337
00:25:36,087 --> 00:25:38,787
An unguarded cart. Someone told Robin Hood.

338
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:41,088
But what if it wasn't him?

339
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:48,489
- My sergeant was the only one that knew.
He was the only one I told.
- Please, Sir Guy, do not do this.

340
00:25:52,091 --> 00:25:54,091
You understand loyalty?

341
00:25:54,992 --> 00:25:56,592
The importance of loyalty?

342
00:25:56,593 --> 00:25:59,593
- Yes, I do. But...
- So...

343
00:25:59,594 --> 00:26:01,594
He must pay for his crime.

344
00:26:10,595 --> 00:26:13,095
- Yes, but did Marian say it was a trap?
- She didn't know.

345
00:26:13,097 --> 00:26:14,997
Well, then we cannot go.

346
00:26:15,098 --> 00:26:18,498
We cannot risk our own lives
for three worthless rascals.

347
00:26:18,499 --> 00:26:20,499
We're going to Nottingham.

348
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,100
I'll see you there.

349
00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:27,001
Master, surely...

350
00:26:27,102 --> 00:26:29,451
- Why are we...
- For family.

351
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,404
For Allan's brother.

352
00:26:31,505 --> 00:26:34,405
We do not let the Sheriff hang our family,

353
00:26:34,506 --> 00:26:37,506
no matter how unreliable they may be.

354
00:26:38,507 --> 00:26:40,207
Robin...

355
00:26:41,008 --> 00:26:44,108
- God bless you, my friend.
- Don't mention it, my friend.

356
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,510
Bring the girl.

357
00:27:07,011 --> 00:27:09,511
- Oh, the bride.
- Yes, my lord?

358
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:12,913
Lower your collar.

359
00:27:26,914 --> 00:27:29,562
- Where did you get this?
- My mother gave it to me.

360
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:34,303
And I took it from you.
How did you get it back?

361
00:27:38,018 --> 00:27:40,518
Robin Hood gave it to me.

362
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:46,019
Let's have a look.

363
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,520
I'll give you a ha'penny for it.

364
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:53,521
Keep it. It means nothing to me.

365
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:56,422
Lucky Lucky George!

366
00:28:04,523 --> 00:28:06,803
- I've been betrayed.
- Again?

367
00:28:06,825 --> 00:28:08,525
Hm! Making a habit of it, aren't you?

368
00:28:08,526 --> 00:28:11,349
Not again. I was wrong.

369
00:28:11,828 --> 00:28:14,428
My sergeant died an innocent man.

370
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:16,529
Well, I'm sure he was guilty of something.

371
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,330
It was Marian.

372
00:28:22,531 --> 00:28:24,131
I have the proof.

373
00:28:25,232 --> 00:28:26,832
Marian?

374
00:28:30,533 --> 00:28:32,533
Am I surprised?

375
00:28:32,534 --> 00:28:34,534
Clue: no.

376
00:28:35,535 --> 00:28:38,815
It's always the girl.
I told you.

377
00:28:38,837 --> 00:28:40,837
Women. Lepers.

378
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:46,038
Aww, you're really hurt, hmm?

379
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,539
Can you feel the hot metal of the knife
twisting in your back, hm?

380
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,540
All the time she was smiling at you,
but really she was laughing at you,

381
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:01,441
betraying you, despising you,

382
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:03,142
humiliating you.

383
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:07,543
And what do you want to do to her now?

384
00:29:09,544 --> 00:29:10,844
Go.

385
00:29:12,545 --> 00:29:14,545
And enjoy it.

386
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:19,546
In there.

387
00:29:20,547 --> 00:29:22,347
Yeah. That's the lot that tried to rob me.

388
00:29:25,048 --> 00:29:26,048
Have pity on us.

389
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,348
- Get off me!
This was clean on!

390
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:33,549
Robin will save us. He'll be here!

391
00:29:33,551 --> 00:29:35,551
Oh, no, he won't!

392
00:29:51,052 --> 00:29:52,552
What are you doing?

393
00:29:52,553 --> 00:29:54,053
I must speak to Robin.

394
00:29:54,054 --> 00:29:55,545
Why? What's happened?

395
00:29:56,056 --> 00:29:59,263
Lord Gisborne took the necklace from me
and made me tell him...

396
00:29:59,358 --> 00:30:01,258
Kiss me.

397
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,560
Sorry.

398
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:11,561
Much!

399
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,562
Tell me what happened.

400
00:30:20,063 --> 00:30:23,414
We have a problem. We have many problems,
most of them guard -shaped. Come on.

401
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:27,326
Remember the necklace?
Lucky George has got it.

402
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:28,968
And Gisborne knows you gave it to Eleri.

403
00:30:28,969 --> 00:30:31,569
- What? How?
- She was scared out of her wits.

404
00:30:38,571 --> 00:30:41,371
We rescue Tom and then we warn Marian.

405
00:30:41,572 --> 00:30:44,072
Now, get the uniforms, come on.

406
00:31:03,573 --> 00:31:05,573
All those eager faces.

407
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:12,574
You're all expecting Robin Hood
to turn up, aren't you? Hm?

408
00:31:13,075 --> 00:31:16,075
Do a few tricks
with his bow and arrow?

409
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:19,576
Well, this is no time for schoolboy tricks.

410
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:21,577
This is justice.

411
00:31:22,578 --> 00:31:23,578
We have laws.

412
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:27,579
Robin Hood has no respect for the law.

413
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:30,582
Robin Hood flouts the law.

414
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,584
He would have us all be criminals.

415
00:31:33,985 --> 00:31:35,585
Murdering and stealing.

416
00:31:35,586 --> 00:31:39,586
And yet still, you wait here expecting him
to come and save one of his own.

417
00:31:41,587 --> 00:31:43,087
Yes, of course you do.

418
00:31:43,188 --> 00:31:44,588
Which is why...

419
00:31:45,589 --> 00:31:50,589
I have brought the hanging forward by one hour.
Look up there!

420
00:31:59,591 --> 00:32:01,591
You're too late, Robin Hood!

421
00:32:04,392 --> 00:32:05,592
Your men are already dead!

422
00:32:10,593 --> 00:32:14,593
Ooh, I wish you could have seen
the look on their faces

423
00:32:14,594 --> 00:32:18,594
just before they realized
that you weren't coming to rescue them.

424
00:32:21,095 --> 00:32:22,095
Oh, it was very moving.

425
00:32:23,096 --> 00:32:26,596
First there was... disappointment...

426
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:30,597
tinged with confusion,

427
00:32:31,598 --> 00:32:33,598
soon to be replaced by anger,

428
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:35,099
and then tears,

429
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,200
just before they realized

430
00:32:38,101 --> 00:32:39,601
that it was the final, fatal drop.

431
00:32:40,002 --> 00:32:42,602
It was very moving, very touching.

432
00:32:43,203 --> 00:32:44,203
Yes!

433
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:47,504
I wish you could have seen that, Hood!

434
00:32:50,305 --> 00:32:52,605
Well, thank you very much.

435
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:57,606
Oh, will one of you tell Robin Hood
if you do see him?

436
00:32:58,007 --> 00:32:59,507
Thank you.

437
00:33:01,608 --> 00:33:05,608
Eager, smiling faces. Good.

438
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,610
All in a day's work. Ha! Ha!

439
00:33:10,611 --> 00:33:12,611
Sheriff coming through!

440
00:33:21,612 --> 00:33:23,612
Robin. Marian?

441
00:33:26,813 --> 00:33:30,613
You have come for the belongings
of the hanged man. Tom A Dale.

442
00:33:30,614 --> 00:33:33,614
You are his cousin. Bring them here quickly!

443
00:33:57,915 --> 00:33:59,615
Gisborne knows you gave me the necklace.

444
00:33:59,616 --> 00:34:02,016
He knows you betrayed him.
You are in grave danger.

445
00:34:02,617 --> 00:34:03,617
No...

446
00:34:03,618 --> 00:34:07,018
I will get it back for you.
He'll be leaving for Knighton Hall now.

447
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:10,219
- My father.
- Wait for me.

448
00:34:10,221 --> 00:34:11,221
I can't leave him.

449
00:34:11,222 --> 00:34:13,222
Marian, you cannot go home now.
It is too dangerous.

450
00:34:13,223 --> 00:34:16,223
He is weak already,
he cannot defend himself if...

451
00:34:16,224 --> 00:34:17,224
Marian,

452
00:34:17,225 --> 00:34:18,225
look at me.

453
00:34:18,226 --> 00:34:20,226
Look at me. Give me time.

454
00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:22,727
I will get you the necklace.

455
00:34:30,928 --> 00:34:32,528
Will, go and find Allan and Djaq.

456
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:36,529
We need to find Lucky George.

457
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,530
He has to be here.

458
00:34:42,231 --> 00:34:43,831
What do you want?

459
00:34:48,531 --> 00:34:50,031
Maybe some salt?

460
00:34:50,532 --> 00:34:52,032
Where 's Marian?

461
00:34:53,533 --> 00:34:54,533
Good question.

462
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:58,834
If you've hurt her...
f you've done anything to her...

463
00:34:59,535 --> 00:35:01,035
You'll what?

464
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,836
- Speak of the devil.
- Sir Guy. We were not expecting you.

465
00:35:08,538 --> 00:35:11,392
I know. Sorry.

466
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,740
I just popped in for a little chat.

467
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:19,600
- Where have you been?
- At the hanging.

468
00:35:20,843 --> 00:35:21,843
Can we get you something to drink?

469
00:35:23,044 --> 00:35:24,544
I don't think so.

470
00:35:33,545 --> 00:35:36,941
- Show me your necklace.
- What necklace?

471
00:35:38,047 --> 00:35:39,547
If I may say, Sir Guy...

472
00:35:40,548 --> 00:35:42,548
Show me your necklace.

473
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:52,549
Robin is looking for you.

474
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,150
- I'm sorry.
- Give us a moment.

475
00:36:06,852 --> 00:36:10,718
I had a brother. A twin.

476
00:36:11,854 --> 00:36:14,254
He was killed in your Crusades.

477
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:22,555
I became him. His name was Djaq.

478
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:28,256
He still lives here, inside me.

479
00:36:29,558 --> 00:36:31,258
Like your brother lives inside you.

480
00:36:32,259 --> 00:36:34,559
That's what I worry about.

481
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,060
Don't you want to take a look?

482
00:36:39,561 --> 00:36:42,561
Look at what?
A sack of rags.

483
00:36:43,562 --> 00:36:45,062
It's not much to show for a life.

484
00:36:56,563 --> 00:36:59,063
- You would have me prove my innocence?
- Show me the necklace.

485
00:36:59,065 --> 00:37:01,565
- Have I committed a crime?
- Show me the necklace.

486
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:04,567
I will not. This is the end of our friendship.

487
00:37:04,568 --> 00:37:06,568
How can I be friends with someone
who demands...

488
00:37:06,569 --> 00:37:09,269
...I prove my innocence
without stating my crime?

489
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:15,570
You betrayed me to Robin Hood. You gave
him the necklace. You told him of my plan.

490
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:17,271
And now you will pay the price.

491
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:19,384
- You have no proof.
- And you have no necklace.

492
00:37:19,385 --> 00:37:21,099
- It is upstairs.
- No, it's not.

493
00:37:21,175 --> 00:37:25,659
- It is in my bedchamber. I will fetch it for you.
- Don't waste my time.

494
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:27,377
Please.

495
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,378
Let me prove myself to you.

496
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:52,579
Driver! Why are we stopping?

497
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,180
What is it this time?

498
00:37:58,582 --> 00:37:59,582
The necklace Gisborne gave you.

499
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:02,107
- What, er, silver? Celtic design?
- Yes.

500
00:38:02,585 --> 00:38:04,585
Never seen it.

501
00:38:05,586 --> 00:38:10,586
One chance. Give us the necklace or we
kill you and search your goods ourselves.

502
00:38:12,287 --> 00:38:13,787
This is no game.

503
00:38:17,588 --> 00:38:19,588
Erm, er, look, just leave me the money
and I'll give you the necklace.

504
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,089
Give us the necklace first.

505
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,590
Er, right. Um...

506
00:38:25,591 --> 00:38:29,789
It's gone. No, no, no, I swear.
I had it but it's gone!

507
00:38:32,593 --> 00:38:34,593
- Master, if we don't have...
- I know!

508
00:38:34,595 --> 00:38:35,595
What do we do?

509
00:38:35,596 --> 00:38:38,596
- I found Allan and Djaq. They found...
- Something you might be interested in.

510
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:40,597
I have to get this to Marian.

511
00:38:41,098 --> 00:38:45,098
You are lucky. Take everything.
And this time I mean everything.

512
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:57,599
Trying to make it look like a robbery?

513
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,500
Oh, my!

514
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,600
Robin Hood's broken in
and stolen the necklace!

515
00:39:12,001 --> 00:39:14,601
- I thought we were friends.
- So did I.

516
00:39:16,603 --> 00:39:23,003
The only reason you paid me any attention
was to feed information to my enemy.

517
00:39:23,304 --> 00:39:26,704
- That's not true.
- Why persist with lies?

518
00:39:28,906 --> 00:39:31,506
You're dead anyway.

519
00:39:34,507 --> 00:39:37,507
Do you still not have the courage
to tell me the truth?

520
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:40,508
The truth?

521
00:39:42,509 --> 00:39:46,509
The truth is, this country
is being choked to death.

522
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:53,010
The truth is, honest people
are being forced to lie and cheat and steal.

523
00:39:53,511 --> 00:39:55,011
And if you really want the truth,

524
00:39:55,512 --> 00:39:58,512
then you should know that I...

525
00:40:02,313 --> 00:40:03,013
What?

526
00:40:08,514 --> 00:40:11,014
I have something to show you.

527
00:40:24,515 --> 00:40:25,515
It's not possible.

528
00:40:27,516 --> 00:40:30,016
Feel it. It is real.

529
00:40:33,018 --> 00:40:34,518
And you owe me an apology.

530
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,219
I'm sorry.

531
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,520
I was wrong.

532
00:40:46,521 --> 00:40:49,021
Marian, I told the Sheriff that you betrayed us.

533
00:40:49,022 --> 00:40:50,022
Tell him you were mistaken.

534
00:40:51,523 --> 00:40:53,023
He's expecting news of your arrest.

535
00:40:53,024 --> 00:40:54,024
Show him the necklace.

536
00:40:56,025 --> 00:40:57,525
No necklace will persuade the Sheriff.

537
00:40:58,526 --> 00:41:00,026
How could he trust you after this?

538
00:41:00,527 --> 00:41:01,727
I cannot protect you.

539
00:41:01,728 --> 00:41:03,728
You must. It is proof.

540
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:05,829
You have already defied the Sheriff once.

541
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,030
Suspicion will cling to you and your father.

542
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:11,031
You must prove your loyalty beyond all doubt.

543
00:41:14,032 --> 00:41:15,032
Marry me.

544
00:41:17,033 --> 00:41:19,533
It's the only way. As Lady Gisborne
I could protect you.

545
00:41:19,534 --> 00:41:20,534
What do you say?

546
00:41:20,935 --> 00:41:22,235
You leave me no time to think.

547
00:41:22,836 --> 00:41:25,536
A moment ago you'd have me hanged
and now you want to marry me?

548
00:41:26,037 --> 00:41:28,837
- Is it so difficult to prove your loyalty?
- I am loyal but...

549
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:30,439
But what?

550
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,040
- I know you were once betrothed to Robin Hood.
- I was a girl then.

551
00:41:36,342 --> 00:41:38,542
Would you still hesitate
if he were asking the question?

552
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:45,543
I would never marry him.

553
00:41:48,044 --> 00:41:50,444
I despise Robin Hood.

554
00:41:51,545 --> 00:41:52,545
Really?

555
00:41:57,046 --> 00:41:59,046
So what about me?

556
00:42:01,347 --> 00:42:05,547
Will you... marry... me?

557
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:15,048
Yes.

558
00:42:17,549 --> 00:42:18,549
I will marry you.

559
00:42:20,549 --> 00:42:23,549
I will marry you the day
King Richard returns to England.

560
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:38,250
Shall we go downstairs
and tell my father the good news?

561
00:42:39,251 --> 00:42:40,251
Yes.

562
00:42:42,252 --> 00:42:43,552
I have an apology to make.

563
00:42:53,053 --> 00:42:55,053
Sorry!

564
00:43:11,354 --> 00:43:13,054
I now pronounce you man and wife.

565
00:43:14,055 --> 00:43:15,055
You may kiss the bride.

566
00:43:23,056 --> 00:43:25,056
A gift.

567
00:43:26,057 --> 00:43:27,557
From Lucky George.

568
00:43:27,758 --> 00:43:29,758
Thank you. For everything.

569
00:43:34,259 --> 00:43:36,259
I love a wedding.

570
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,160
And this is one of the best cakes
I have ever tasted.
