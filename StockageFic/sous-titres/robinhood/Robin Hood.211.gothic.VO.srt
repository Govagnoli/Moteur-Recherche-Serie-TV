1
00:00:14,704 --> 00:00:16,059
Get down, get down.

2
00:00:21,207 --> 00:00:23,157
- Where's Much?
- Don't know.

3
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,331
<i>Right on my sword!</i>

4
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,324
Mercenaries.

5
00:00:33,764 --> 00:00:36,080
Fitting to see Allan's
at their head, hey?

6
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,720
The Sheriff must be
stepping up his plans.

7
00:00:41,898 --> 00:00:44,520
There's a regiment's-worth
of food there.

8
00:00:44,843 --> 00:00:47,720
That will feed Locksley
for the whole winter. Come on.

9
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:48,601
It's all right, we'll be done soon.

10
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:50,664
There's enough here
to feed an army, Robin.

11
00:01:50,784 --> 00:01:52,440
That's what I'm worried about.

12
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:55,280
Something big is happening
and we need to be ready.

13
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:16,462
Robin!?

14
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,732
- Legrand?
- I have a message from the King.

15
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Moochie
Sub Wood Team

16
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,803
The King's message.

17
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,360
You're hard men to find. We've been
wandering this infernal forest for days.

18
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:23,313
Well, still, you might have announced
yourselves a little less violently.

19
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:26,920
And this.
An eye looking down upon a King.

20
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:31,040
It could mean anything.
The King gave you no more clues?

21
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:33,111
But who's the contact?

22
00:03:33,231 --> 00:03:35,736
A wool merchant,
goes by the name of Paxton.

23
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:37,558
He awaits us.

24
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:43,520
The King was insistent we complete
this mission by Midsummer's Day.

25
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,920
- And what are we looking for?
- <i>Thesaurus Patriae.</i>

26
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:49,760
That's Latin
for "treasure of the nation".

27
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:53,600
She speaks Latin? What a woman!

28
00:03:58,073 --> 00:03:59,000
Thanks.

29
00:04:17,264 --> 00:04:18,069
Allan!

30
00:04:19,774 --> 00:04:21,424
Where are the supplies?

31
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,246
They are tired and hungry
and we have no food for them.

32
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:25,909
Tell me this is some kind of a joke.

33
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:28,679
There's a food store
Robin used to use near Nettlestone.

34
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,523
He used to keep
food there in the winter.

35
00:04:30,643 --> 00:04:33,369
You just remembered this?
Convenient. You're lying.

36
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:34,346
No, I'm not.

37
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:37,347
I'm sick and tired of being made
to look like a fool by you

38
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:40,615
and your friends
when you are in on their secrets.

39
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:42,862
- What secrets?
- You know what I'm talking about.

40
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,272
You're going to tell me everything, now.

41
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:48,159
You know about Robin,
the rest are just peasants like me.

42
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,229
- Tell me!
- What's going on?

43
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,026
You, wait here.

44
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:00,480
Why has the entire village been cleared?

45
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,649
The village has been requisitioned.

46
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,000
- You shouldn't have come here,
- Because I am a woman?

47
00:05:05,977 --> 00:05:08,780
How about the women and children
who have been forced out of their homes?

48
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,447
There is nothing I can do.

49
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:12,320
The Sheriff ordered it. No arguments.

50
00:05:12,574 --> 00:05:15,498
Not long ago you were willing
to defy Prince John's men.

51
00:05:15,618 --> 00:05:17,771
Yes, but the situation
has now changed.

52
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:19,625
Because the Sheriff is back?

53
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:23,719
While he was gone...

54
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:27,360
I thought I saw
a different side to you, Guy.

55
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:32,560
Kind, brave...

56
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:37,639
I was mistaken.

57
00:05:48,018 --> 00:05:50,369
You and your men
should rest, Legrand.

58
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:52,018
Three days without sleep.

59
00:05:52,138 --> 00:05:55,488
I could go ten and still run rings
round the lot of you.

60
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,609
So, you think the King
is collecting treasure?

61
00:05:59,428 --> 00:06:02,080
He needs men and equipment to take
on the Sheriff and Prince John.

62
00:06:02,393 --> 00:06:05,800
That means money. I think he's trying
to get his fortune out of the country.

63
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,009
The King's gone to real pains.

64
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:12,409
I mean, two messengers, a code,
rendezvous on specific days.

65
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:15,080
This is bigger than gold and money.

66
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:17,989
I think this plan has been in place
for a while.

67
00:06:18,109 --> 00:06:20,200
Midsummer's Day
is the day after tomorrow.

68
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,111
Doesn't leave us much time.

69
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:24,800
It's time enough to pay
this Paxton a visit, come on.

70
00:06:38,318 --> 00:06:39,929
Expecting an army?

71
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:44,069
You get out of my house now!

72
00:06:46,937 --> 00:06:48,709
What's the password?

73
00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:51,792
<i>Thesaurus Patriae.
Thesaurus Patriae.</i>

74
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:55,686
Nice to meet you, Paxton!

75
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,960
This is Legrand
from the King's private guard.

76
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:01,749
My name is Robin Hood.

77
00:07:02,493 --> 00:07:06,104
I was afraid you were the Sheriff's men.
I wanted to be prepared, just in case.

78
00:07:06,224 --> 00:07:07,760
Do you have the message?

79
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:11,319
It's been a heavy burden
but an honour to carry it.

80
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:20,731
What's it mean?

81
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:29,658
Hang on.

82
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:46,322
- What are you doing? You'll burn 'em!
- He knows exactly what he's doing.

83
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,280
You see?

84
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:51,994
Zaffre.

85
00:07:53,123 --> 00:07:54,800
It's an element used in alchemy.

86
00:07:55,865 --> 00:07:58,280
It only reveals itself
when you apply heat.

87
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,610
Very clever.

88
00:08:05,676 --> 00:08:09,141
It might be clever, but it still
doesn't look like anything.

89
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:14,519
What did I tell ya?

90
00:08:15,123 --> 00:08:16,480
It's all in here!

91
00:08:26,752 --> 00:08:28,480
We used to bring stuff
we'd stolen here.

92
00:08:28,735 --> 00:08:31,469
- Grain or what-have-you, for the poor.
- Good.

93
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:33,149
Bring everything.

94
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:35,880
Right, you lot,
let's get it back in the wagon.

95
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,240
It's a star map,
I'm telling you. Look, Djaq.

96
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:44,049
That's the moon, this is the night
sky and those are the stars.

97
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:46,479
No, Much, they don't work that way.
Wrong shape.

98
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:50,009
That's not a moon, anyway.
It's the sun, if anything.

99
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,789
What if the dots make a circle?

100
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:55,622
A circle.

101
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:00,479
Hang on.

102
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:04,369
Right, good.

103
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,999
- We're getting somewhere.
- It could be a building.

104
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:10,160
Each dot represents a foundation stone
and the sword points to the entrance.

105
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:14,079
But there's no clue as to what
kind of building it is or where.

106
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,471
Hold, hold, hold.

107
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,981
That might be for you.

108
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,381
Carry on working, I'll be back.

109
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:28,508
That signal.
Is that a member of the gang?

110
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:31,029
Something like that.

111
00:09:46,394 --> 00:09:47,442
I'm up here.

112
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,329
I've missed you.

113
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:04,354
I've missed you too.

114
00:10:09,544 --> 00:10:12,094
Do you know what's happening
in Locksley?

115
00:10:12,392 --> 00:10:13,164
What?

116
00:10:13,284 --> 00:10:15,760
Gisborne's turned all the villagers out.

117
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,971
He's made it a garrison
for his mercenaries.

118
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:19,720
What about the people?
Where are they?

119
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,925
In the forest or with families
from other villages.

120
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,760
- Right, we'll get food to them.
- You can't.

121
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:32,400
Allan told Gisborne about the secret
food store. And he's taking everything

122
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,841
If we move now, we could take
the garrison by surprise.

123
00:10:34,961 --> 00:10:36,099
I know, but...

124
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:38,800
- we can't, not just yet.
- Why not?!

125
00:10:40,092 --> 00:10:41,960
We've had word from the King,
Marian.

126
00:10:43,487 --> 00:10:46,480
I promise I'll restore Locksley but
I can't until we complete this mission.

127
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:48,642
What are the villagers supposed to do?

128
00:10:48,762 --> 00:10:51,040
You know I would go to them
if I could.

129
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:53,814
King Richard needs me now
more than ever.

130
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,857
We'll be together soon. I promise.

131
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:20,520
And Marian... promise me you won't
do anything in Locksley alone.

132
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,013
Marian? I promise.

133
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:27,932
I promise I won't do anything.

134
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:33,491
But...

135
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:36,377
the Nightwatchman might.

136
00:11:40,005 --> 00:11:41,564
- All right?
- Yeah.

137
00:11:43,028 --> 00:11:44,529
What are you doing, John?

138
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:46,118
The circle of stones.

139
00:11:46,781 --> 00:11:48,800
- The Standing Stones, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

140
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,742
The Standing Stones
at Hathersage Heath.

141
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:53,389
I told you he'd get it!

142
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,280
- Yeah, I'd have got that.
- No, you wouldn't.

143
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,480
Robin, I need to leave you now.

144
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:05,336
I will prepare a ship to leave tomorrow
night from Hull with the treasure.

145
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,560
Thank you, the King is in your debt.

146
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,969
I am proud to have been of service.

147
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:12,545
Right, you lot! To Hathersage Heath!

148
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:31,851
What sort of a place is this?

149
00:12:37,845 --> 00:12:40,400
It's been here
as long as anyone can remember.

150
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:42,680
Some kind of settlement?

151
00:12:43,987 --> 00:12:45,161
Or a shrine.

152
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:48,414
The sword points to that one.

153
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:54,333
These stones are all perfectly aligned.

154
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,600
But what if the sword
isn't pointing north?

155
00:13:01,303 --> 00:13:04,061
What if it's an instruction
to follow this line?

156
00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:29,774
Well, come on... Follow the arrow!

157
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,032
Look!

158
00:13:42,951 --> 00:13:43,726
Here!

159
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:48,240
What does this mean?

160
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,240
- That must be the way in.
- The way in? To where?

161
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:01,480
Come on.

162
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,833
I knew these would come in handy.

163
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:11,863
Wait...

164
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:14,151
Come on.

165
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:20,280
- Something I trod on just moved.
- It was me!

166
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:24,477
Come on. Keep moving.

167
00:14:26,017 --> 00:14:27,043
A dead end.

168
00:14:33,194 --> 00:14:34,139
Wait...

169
00:14:34,636 --> 00:14:35,960
Your candle's flickering.

170
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,800
Fresh air is getting through.

171
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:39,749
Yeah, I can feel it.

172
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:40,953
Stand aside.

173
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:53,724
Legrand, you have nothing to prove,
my friend. You'll never move it alone.

174
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:55,520
- My boys.
- Well, come on.

175
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:02,349
John, we need your help.

176
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:04,373
Right, move.

177
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,574
I loosened it.

178
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:35,033
Yeah, right.

179
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:41,689
There's light getting in from somewhere.

180
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:43,609
It's getting stronger.

181
00:15:43,853 --> 00:15:47,215
Hey, it's coming from over there.
It's almost midday.

182
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:52,680
I get it. When it's directly
overhead, it should just...

183
00:16:00,345 --> 00:16:03,589
That looks like the eye
on the King's message!

184
00:16:03,804 --> 00:16:04,966
Wait! Wait!

185
00:16:08,189 --> 00:16:09,933
Follow the line of the eye.

186
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:17,682
What is it? What is it?

187
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,650
- Yes!
- Right.

188
00:16:22,612 --> 00:16:23,513
Right.

189
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:25,440
<i>Thesaurus Patriae.</i>

190
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:26,977
What is it?

191
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:29,120
It's another map!

192
00:16:30,301 --> 00:16:33,040
It's a cross, it's at Kirklees.

193
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:36,135
Sign of the cross at Kirklees.
Kirklees Abbey.

194
00:16:36,255 --> 00:16:39,480
- Kirklees Abbey? How interesting!
- Paxton, you traitor!

195
00:16:39,641 --> 00:16:41,120
Last one there's a rotten egg!

196
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:44,022
- Stop him!
<i>- Bye, Hood! Thank you!</i>

197
00:16:47,396 --> 00:16:49,925
The light's fading.
The sun's passing over.

198
00:16:50,806 --> 00:16:53,164
- What now?
- We're trapped.

199
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:56,877
Assemble the men, we ride immediately.

200
00:16:56,997 --> 00:16:59,942
About the treasure. I deserve a cut...

201
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:01,638
for services rendered.

202
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:02,976
A cut?

203
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,010
Well...

204
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:08,009
Yes, if you want a cut...

205
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:09,794
a cut you shall have!

206
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:14,978
Payment in full.

207
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:19,774
To Kirklees Abbey!

208
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:10,400
Oh, great. What are you doing here?

209
00:18:12,346 --> 00:18:16,061
Look, you just walk away now.
No-one needs to know you were ever here.

210
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,960
- Guy, I've caught the Nightwatchman!
- Into the lion's den, eh?

211
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:34,160
Fearless...

212
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,558
... or stupid?

213
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,099
Let's find out who you are.

214
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,276
Leave him - he's had enough, Guy!

215
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:02,021
No...

216
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:07,158
Not you.

217
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:22,480
We only have a few hours
to get to that rendezvous point.

218
00:19:24,189 --> 00:19:28,184
I'm sure Kirklees Abbey is to the north
of the river. Unless it's to the south.

219
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:31,514
North or south, what does it matter
if we die here?

220
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:34,099
And this rock
won't move for anyone.

221
00:19:37,255 --> 00:19:38,543
Go on, John.

222
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:41,760
Oh, you've got no hope.

223
00:19:44,293 --> 00:19:46,080
Come on, John. Go on.

224
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,200
Go on, John.

225
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,175
Go on! Go on, John!

226
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,518
Come on! Go on, John!

227
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,200
Go on! Lift it!

228
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,560
- John, get it!
- I don't believe it.

229
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,240
Come on! Yes!

230
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:18,149
Yes! Yes! Yes!

231
00:20:19,077 --> 00:20:22,131
- Out NOW!
- Go, go, go. Yes!

232
00:20:34,245 --> 00:20:36,125
John, let it go, come on, John.

233
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,909
- John, let it go...
- He can't. If he does he'll be crushed.

234
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:42,240
John, push it away, come on now.

235
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:45,103
Nothing... left...

236
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:49,607
A hand?

237
00:20:54,189 --> 00:20:55,360
Come on!

238
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:03,840
Djaq, take these.

239
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:08,766
Right, to Kirklees.

240
00:21:09,678 --> 00:21:12,613
The Sheriff is going to get there first.
He's going to get the treasure.

241
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:15,709
- Not if he's going the wrong way.
- Kirklees Abbey, you said it.

242
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:18,400
That's before I looked
at the map properly. Look.

243
00:21:18,662 --> 00:21:20,919
The cross is on the south of the river.

244
00:21:21,856 --> 00:21:24,880
The Abbey of Kirklees, the one
that we know, is on the north bank.

245
00:21:25,431 --> 00:21:28,622
So, we are searching for a church
on the south side?

246
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:31,869
The Sheriff doesn't know that.
We need to hurry.

247
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,130
We go across country, avoid
the roads. That means running.

248
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,028
This is for the King.

249
00:21:42,345 --> 00:21:43,960
The Sheriff's killed Paxton.

250
00:22:11,147 --> 00:22:12,845
Where is the treasure?

251
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:16,240
It's not at Kirklees, so you,

252
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:19,560
you find me a church
and you find it now!

253
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:46,604
Help me.

254
00:22:49,105 --> 00:22:52,219
Distract them long enough
so that I can get into the forest.

255
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:54,689
- This place is surrounded.
- Please!

256
00:22:55,129 --> 00:22:57,440
- We have to do something.
- I don't have to do anything.

257
00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:01,280
I'm sorry, if I mess up with Gisborne
now, I've got nothing left, Marian.

258
00:23:02,872 --> 00:23:04,775
I could talk to Robin for you.

259
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:06,569
You don't get it, do you?

260
00:23:06,689 --> 00:23:09,160
Even if I wanted to go back,
I couldn't, it's too late.

261
00:23:09,705 --> 00:23:12,560
I've helped you wherever I can,
Marian, you know that, but this...

262
00:23:17,802 --> 00:23:18,827
A year ago

263
00:23:20,077 --> 00:23:22,680
I put this dagger
into the Nightwatchman's side.

264
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:26,320
Show me.

265
00:23:57,589 --> 00:24:00,225
Prepare the prisoner.
We return to Nottingham.

266
00:24:01,302 --> 00:24:04,122
I've sent word to the Sheriff that
we've captured the Nightwatchman.

267
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:05,802
- Guy...
- You...

268
00:24:06,306 --> 00:24:08,334
do not speak to me!

269
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:18,855
Why would the King trust something
so precious to a place like this?

270
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:23,055
That map must be playing tricks again.

271
00:24:23,515 --> 00:24:26,034
This is the only church
south of the river.

272
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:30,240
I don't know, I think
this might be the right place.

273
00:24:33,151 --> 00:24:33,892
Wait.

274
00:24:55,691 --> 00:24:56,760
Your Majesty.

275
00:24:57,603 --> 00:24:58,718
I know you!

276
00:25:00,439 --> 00:25:02,289
Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine!

277
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:04,973
The Queen Mother!

278
00:25:09,192 --> 00:25:10,769
<i>Thesaurus Patriae.</i>

279
00:25:12,265 --> 00:25:14,160
YOU'RE the treasure of the nation.

280
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,782
Why such formality,
Robin of Locksley.

281
00:25:18,193 --> 00:25:20,120
I thought we were friends!

282
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:22,930
You're late, Robin.

283
00:25:24,712 --> 00:25:26,889
Apologies, Your Majesty.

284
00:25:27,646 --> 00:25:29,133
We ran into a few problems.

285
00:25:29,253 --> 00:25:30,963
But you're meant to be in France.

286
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:33,719
No wonder you've taken so long
to find me, Legrand,

287
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,630
if that's where you've been looking.

288
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,078
My son Prince John invited me
to spend Christmas with him.

289
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,284
Festive celebrations

290
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,600
entailed locking me
in the tower of Pontefract Castle.

291
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,672
So, Prince John announces
your allegiance to him

292
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:50,400
and secures the army of Aquitaine
to fight against King Richard.

293
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:54,099
But you're the Queen Mother!
Less of the mother, thank you!

294
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:56,213
So...

295
00:25:57,009 --> 00:25:59,840
You are Robin Hood's famous outlaws.

296
00:26:01,749 --> 00:26:03,199
It appears you have been

297
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:06,408
doing most of the work
for my son, King Richard.

298
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,520
And who is this?

299
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,313
This is Djaq from the Holy Land,
Your Majesty.

300
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:16,469
Interesting.
You're a long way from home, Djaq.

301
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,560
Why did you choose
this particular battle here?

302
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:21,649
It chose me, Your Majesty.

303
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:24,040
I fight here with my friends.

304
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:27,399
I should like to know you better.

305
00:26:28,261 --> 00:26:30,062
I'm Much, Your Majesty.

306
00:26:32,837 --> 00:26:34,182
And this is, er...

307
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,841
- Will.
- Will.

308
00:26:39,003 --> 00:26:40,074
Of course.

309
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:42,640
But who is this fellow?

310
00:26:43,189 --> 00:26:46,360
This, Your Majesty, is Little John.

311
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:50,239
Little? I can't believe
there's a part of you that's little!

312
00:26:51,595 --> 00:26:54,560
I need a man like you
around the castle in Aquitaine.

313
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:56,250
We will talk later.

314
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:00,010
Behind me, Your Majesty!

315
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,459
- Time to leave!
- That's the only way out of here.

316
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:04,749
Here we go again.

317
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:08,149
Provision has been made
for all eventualities.

318
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:11,400
This leads directly to Barnsdale Forest.

319
00:27:11,949 --> 00:27:14,039
Perhaps you would do the honour.

320
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:16,181
You... big bear.

321
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:21,960
Stop banging, you blithering oafs.

322
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,720
There is no escape.

323
00:27:28,407 --> 00:27:30,760
My men are all over the forest.

324
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,840
You're too late, Sheriff.
This treasure is ours.

325
00:27:38,751 --> 00:27:41,520
- And what a national treasure it is.
- Who is that man?

326
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:45,320
Sheriff of Nottingham. Love the dress.
You'd better come with me.

327
00:27:45,484 --> 00:27:48,689
What? So you can hold her
to ransom in the tower?

328
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:51,250
- I don't think so.
- That man

329
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,319
is a sworn enemy of the state

330
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:56,520
and especially your son, Prince John.

331
00:27:56,681 --> 00:27:59,600
Alas, one can choose one's friends
but not one's family.

332
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,279
You and John deserve each other.

333
00:28:03,002 --> 00:28:06,760
Then, alas, you shall never
leave England alive.

334
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:09,238
Are you always this odious

335
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:12,053
or have you just practised for me?

336
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:16,040
You haven't seen the half of it.

337
00:28:18,018 --> 00:28:20,360
- Open this door!
- Let's go, come on!

338
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,507
My, what strong arms you have.

339
00:28:24,627 --> 00:28:26,544
<i>Stop! Open this door, now!</i>

340
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,267
Open this door!

341
00:28:44,952 --> 00:28:46,689
- Please...
- You're with Robin Hood.

342
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:50,040
An outlaw. I warned you,
the sentence would be death.

343
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,479
I was the Nightwatchman
years before Robin returned.

344
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,840
Don't take me for a fool!

345
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:55,919
It all fits.

346
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:59,139
The way you behaved with me,
your little rides into the forest.

347
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:01,120
- You were trusted at the castle.
- I know.

348
00:29:01,376 --> 00:29:05,267
Every moment that I thought you were
a friend to me, you were betraying me.

349
00:29:05,387 --> 00:29:06,933
- I wasn't...
- Every day

350
00:29:07,053 --> 00:29:10,509
that I grew more and more to love you,
you were mocking me.

351
00:29:10,721 --> 00:29:12,800
It wasn't like that, I cared for you!

352
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,670
I still care for you.

353
00:29:18,335 --> 00:29:20,240
You are a liar.

354
00:29:24,442 --> 00:29:26,447
I stayed at your side

355
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,965
when Prince John's men
were threatening Nottingham.

356
00:29:30,085 --> 00:29:31,599
I could easily have left you!

357
00:29:38,311 --> 00:29:39,849
You are nothing to me.

358
00:29:40,608 --> 00:29:43,149
So, you would rather I was put to death?

359
00:29:43,385 --> 00:29:46,755
Lose everything
we've ever had or ever could have?

360
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:49,097
I've lost
far more than that already.

361
00:29:59,888 --> 00:30:02,646
Oh, I must rest. I can't run any more.

362
00:30:02,766 --> 00:30:04,800
We really shouldn't, Your Majesty.

363
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:07,759
The Sheriff's men
could be on us at any minute.

364
00:30:08,745 --> 00:30:10,179
A few moments, then.

365
00:30:18,143 --> 00:30:18,918
Robin.

366
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:21,639
You gave up a life of ease

367
00:30:21,801 --> 00:30:24,417
to be hunted down like a common outlaw.

368
00:30:24,969 --> 00:30:27,440
- Strange choice.
- It's an easy choice...

369
00:30:28,707 --> 00:30:32,600
when a country's being run by corrupt
men such as the Sheriff and Prince...

370
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,840
I speak out of turn, I'm sorry.

371
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:39,641
Do you always seek out trouble?

372
00:30:40,876 --> 00:30:41,617
No.

373
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:46,565
- Trouble has a habit of finding me.
- It's the attraction of excitement.

374
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:48,920
Like the excitement of attraction.

375
00:30:49,471 --> 00:30:51,019
What do you say?

376
00:30:52,043 --> 00:30:53,011
I, er...

377
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:58,663
- I like the quiet ones.
<i>- Find them! Find them now.</i>

378
00:30:58,909 --> 00:31:00,698
You're a tracker - track!

379
00:31:03,969 --> 00:31:06,400
- It's the Sheriff.
- I can't run any more.

380
00:31:07,787 --> 00:31:08,600
John?

381
00:31:15,793 --> 00:31:17,549
Apologies, Your Majesty.

382
00:31:17,922 --> 00:31:20,040
Please! I'm rather enjoying myself.

383
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:30,767
Marian?

384
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,584
Get the door open!

385
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:40,242
She's escaped! Guards! Stop her.

386
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,004
Marian!

387
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,880
- Allan, stop her!
- Get out of my way!

388
00:31:47,369 --> 00:31:48,480
You little fool!

389
00:31:54,229 --> 00:31:55,730
Did you expect me

390
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,708
to sit here and wait to be executed?

391
00:31:58,828 --> 00:32:01,520
I expect you to know
when you're beaten.

392
00:32:02,535 --> 00:32:03,526
Get out.

393
00:32:04,242 --> 00:32:05,108
Get out!

394
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:09,668
This isn't a game, Marian.

395
00:32:12,026 --> 00:32:14,567
When the Sheriff returns,
you are going to die.

396
00:32:14,687 --> 00:32:17,564
Don't you have the courage
to finish this yourself?

397
00:32:18,601 --> 00:32:21,094
After all my so-called betrayals,

398
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:24,013
you should be glad to do it.

399
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:27,360
This is not my decision.
Then perhaps it should be.

400
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:31,389
After all, you were the one
who professed to love me.

401
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:34,234
- I thought that I knew you.
- But this is me!

402
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:37,920
This is who I am!
The Nightwatchman. Everything.

403
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:40,360
You say you love me
and you don't know me.

404
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,238
I defended you against the Sheriff
countless times, more than you know.

405
00:32:43,358 --> 00:32:47,206
I deceived the Sheriff to help people
and in so doing I had to deceive you.

406
00:32:47,326 --> 00:32:49,343
And I'm sorry for that.

407
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,440
But is it such a crime
to follow my heart?

408
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,069
The way I have followed mine?

409
00:32:56,189 --> 00:32:58,480
And always to your door!

410
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:01,010
Marian,

411
00:33:02,622 --> 00:33:05,134
why did you have to put me
in this position?

412
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:10,471
Did you even once understand
what I was feeling

413
00:33:10,591 --> 00:33:11,520
or thinking?

414
00:33:17,858 --> 00:33:21,801
When you left, I thought that
I'd lost you for good.

415
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:26,674
Perhaps it would've been better
if I had.

416
00:33:34,358 --> 00:33:35,919
We keep heading east.

417
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:52,370
What is it? Why have we stopped?

418
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,760
This, my lady, is an ambush.

419
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:05,680
Such a charming scene.

420
00:34:08,694 --> 00:34:10,141
Thank you, big bear.

421
00:34:13,915 --> 00:34:17,669
I presume for the right price, Sheriff,
you'd be willing to let us go?

422
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:21,592
No, no, no, Your Majesty, you're
worth far more to me than jewels.

423
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:23,800
You do not scare me.

424
00:34:24,252 --> 00:34:25,938
Oh, such spirit.

425
00:34:26,371 --> 00:34:28,109
Bring her and kill the rest.

426
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,800
- And him.
- Legrand!

427
00:34:51,279 --> 00:34:53,316
- For the Queen!
- For the Queen!

428
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:00,720
Why is nothing ever simple!?

429
00:35:05,622 --> 00:35:06,671
This way.

430
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,091
Get down and stay down!

431
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:11,584
M'lady.

432
00:35:12,029 --> 00:35:13,520
Well, come on, big bear!

433
00:35:30,942 --> 00:35:31,991
Stay down!

434
00:36:01,071 --> 00:36:01,930
Up now!

435
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:16,393
A stronger man, I never knew.

436
00:36:17,183 --> 00:36:20,480
- The Queen.
- Legrand.

437
00:36:31,096 --> 00:36:31,917
Him...

438
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,868
I liked.

439
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:57,006
- The treasure prove elusive?
- Don't be smug, Gisborne.

440
00:36:59,045 --> 00:37:02,213
Where's the Nightwatchman?
I can feel a hanging coming on.

441
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,520
Determined to get something
out of today... Ah, Marian.

442
00:37:06,378 --> 00:37:08,159
Just in time for a little entertainment,

443
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:11,120
we're going to execute
the Nightwatchman.

444
00:37:13,203 --> 00:37:14,240
I am ready.

445
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,640
The Nightwatchman,
he is supposed to be behind bars!

446
00:37:23,009 --> 00:37:24,845
He's escaped! Get after him!

447
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:10,471
Good news, Gisborne.

448
00:38:11,572 --> 00:38:12,760
Only good news.

449
00:38:13,939 --> 00:38:17,211
Tell me you've caught him,
tell me you're ready to string him up.

450
00:38:17,331 --> 00:38:20,395
Tell me I can have my execution!

451
00:38:21,171 --> 00:38:22,356
He escaped.

452
00:38:22,872 --> 00:38:24,570
The Nightwatchman is gone.

453
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:27,323
You have failed me again!

454
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,866
There is too much at stake now.
A kingdom!

455
00:38:40,656 --> 00:38:42,596
Last chance, Gisborne.

456
00:38:58,989 --> 00:39:01,239
You should follow the road
down to the coast.

457
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,722
There'll be a boat moored
at the headlands.

458
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,534
And Legrand's men will sail you
to your friends in Ireland

459
00:39:06,654 --> 00:39:08,960
- and then back on to France.
- Poor Legrand.

460
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:13,440
We'll give him a proper burial.
Don't worry.

461
00:39:13,675 --> 00:39:14,906
He was a hero,

462
00:39:15,799 --> 00:39:17,797
- as are you all.
- Thank you.

463
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:22,097
King Richard will know of your
bravery and sacrifice in helping me.

464
00:39:24,422 --> 00:39:25,744
Your Majesty.

465
00:39:33,036 --> 00:39:35,383
Remember your invitation, big bear.

466
00:39:40,221 --> 00:39:41,577
My contribution.

467
00:39:43,674 --> 00:39:44,916
Your Majesty,

468
00:39:45,495 --> 00:39:47,454
- I can't take this!
- I am rich.

469
00:39:47,574 --> 00:39:49,215
The poor are poor.

470
00:39:49,999 --> 00:39:51,640
Isn't that where you come in?

471
00:39:59,673 --> 00:40:01,553
Right, lads, come on.

472
00:40:22,285 --> 00:40:23,208
Come in.

473
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:25,999
Guy.

474
00:40:27,527 --> 00:40:28,587
You're safe.

475
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,960
You did this for me?

476
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,479
Both of you.

477
00:40:33,896 --> 00:40:37,384
Well, what's being chased by angry
soldiers between friends, eh?

478
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:40,560
Burn that.
The Nightwatchman is no more.

479
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,558
- You will not get another chance.
- I've heard that one before.

480
00:40:43,678 --> 00:40:45,360
I didn't ask for your opinion. Go.

481
00:40:48,335 --> 00:40:49,395
Thank you.

482
00:40:50,429 --> 00:40:51,774
You saved my life.

483
00:40:59,482 --> 00:41:00,999
After everything you said?

484
00:41:02,848 --> 00:41:05,298
You don't know me
as well as you think.

485
00:41:05,739 --> 00:41:08,339
- Guy...
- Will you do something for me now?

486
00:41:08,882 --> 00:41:09,885
Name it.

487
00:41:11,604 --> 00:41:12,525
Stay...

488
00:41:13,485 --> 00:41:15,560
and make this place bearable.

489
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:18,959
I will stay.

490
00:41:21,344 --> 00:41:22,358
Thank you.

491
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,019
You know,
there's something about Sherwood.

492
00:41:37,115 --> 00:41:38,657
- It's home.
- Yeah.

493
00:41:40,522 --> 00:41:41,447
Come on.

494
00:41:42,364 --> 00:41:43,971
It's nearly sunset.

495
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:48,080
And I know plenty of people who will be
grateful of Queen Eleanor's money.

496
00:41:48,652 --> 00:41:49,735
So, John,

497
00:41:50,689 --> 00:41:53,680
planning on visiting Aquitaine
any time soon?

498
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,545
- The Queen Mother fancies you!
- Big bear!

499
00:41:58,444 --> 00:41:59,777
You're all jealous!

500
00:42:07,112 --> 00:42:09,117
- Happy Birthday!
- Homeward.

501
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,381
We're surrounded.

502
00:42:11,501 --> 00:42:13,600
- Marian, I'm going away.
- Where?

503
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,629
The Holy Land? Is this
what I think it is?

504
00:42:15,749 --> 00:42:17,240
Let's go and kill a king.

505
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,640
We need to get out of here now.

506
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,040
Your Majesty. Robin of Loxley.

507
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,320
We are going to get King Richard
to kill Robin Hood.

508
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,305
Kill the Sheriff and I will reward you.
