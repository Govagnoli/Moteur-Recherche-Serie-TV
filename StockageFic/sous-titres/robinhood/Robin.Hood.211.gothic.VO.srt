1
00:00:14,569 --> 00:00:16,059
Get down, get down.

2
00:00:20,889 --> 00:00:22,379
Where's Much? Don't know.

3
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:26,052
Oh! Shhh! Right on my sword!

4
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:33,569
Mercenaries.

5
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:36,449
Fitting to see Allan's
at their head, hey?

6
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:39,054
The Sheriff must be
stepping up his plans.

7
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:44,889
There's a regiment's-worth
of food there.

8
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:48,052
That will feed Locksley
for the whole winter. Come on.

9
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:32,172
HORSE WHINNIES

10
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:48,789
It's all right, lads,
we'll be done soon.

11
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:50,949
There's enough here
to feed an army, Robin.

12
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:52,789
That's what I'm worried about.

13
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,649
Something big is happening
and we need to be ready.

14
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:57,332
BIRD CHATTERS

15
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:19,399
Robin!?
HE LAUGHS

16
00:02:25,649 --> 00:02:28,732
Legrand?
I have a message from the King.

17
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:15,069
The King's message.

18
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:16,549
You're hard men to find.

19
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:19,509
We've been wandering
this infernal forest for days.

20
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:23,909
Well, still, you might have announced
yourselves a little less violently.

21
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:27,789
And this.
An eye looking down upon a King.

22
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:31,869
It could mean anything.
The King gave you no more clues?

23
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:33,469
But who's the contact?

24
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:36,189
A wool merchant,
goes by the name of Paxton.

25
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:37,850
He awaits us.

26
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:43,869
The King was insistent we complete
this mission by Midsummer's Day.

27
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:47,269
And what are we looking for?
Thesaurus Patriae.

28
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:51,349
That's Latin
for "treasure of the nation".

29
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:54,389
She speaks Latin? What a woman!

30
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:55,879
Oi!

31
00:03:57,869 --> 00:03:59,359
Thanks.

32
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:18,149
Allan!

33
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:21,269
Where are the supplies?

34
00:04:21,309 --> 00:04:24,289
These men are tired and hungry
and we have no food for them.

35
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:26,028
Tell me this is some kind of a joke.

36
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:28,949
There's a food store
Robin used to use near Nettlestone.

37
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:32,289
He used to keep
food there in the winter.
You just remembered this? Yeah.

38
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:33,749
Convenient. You're lying.

39
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:37,649
No, I'm not. I'm sick and tired of
being made to look like a fool by you

40
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:40,989
and your friends
when you are in on their secrets.

41
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:43,669
What secrets?
You know what I'm talking about.

42
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:45,809
You're going to tell me
everything, now.

43
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:48,868
You know about Robin,
the rest are just peasants like me.

44
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:50,359
Tell me! What's going on?

45
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:55,535
You, wait here.

46
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:00,809
Why has the entire village
been cleared?

47
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:02,729
The village has been requisitioned.

48
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:06,489
You shouldn't have come here,
not with these men here.
Because I am a woman?

49
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:11,429
How about the women and children
who have been forced out of their
homes? There is nothing I can do.

50
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:12,668
The Sheriff ordered it.

51
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:15,329
Not long ago you were willing
to defy Prince John's men.

52
00:05:15,369 --> 00:05:18,489
Yes, but the situation
has now changed.

53
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:22,229
Because the Sheriff is back?

54
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:23,719
While he was gone...

55
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:27,840
...I thought I saw
a different side to you, Guy.

56
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:32,932
Kind, brave...

57
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:37,657
I was mistaken.

58
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:50,449
You and your men
should rest, Legrand.

59
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:52,249
Three days without sleep.

60
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:55,149
I could go ten and still run rings
round the lot of you.

61
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:58,689
So, you think the King
is collecting treasure?

62
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:02,429
He needs men and equipment to take
on the Sheriff and Prince John.

63
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:06,169
That means money.
I think he's trying to get
his fortune out of the country.

64
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:08,089
The King's gone to real pains.

65
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:12,489
I mean, two messengers, a code,
rendezvous on specific days.

66
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:15,449
I think this is bigger
than gold and money.

67
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:18,588
I think this plan has been in place
for a while.

68
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:20,729
Midsummer's Day
is the day after tomorrow.

69
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:22,169
Doesn't leave us much time.

70
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:25,138
It's time enough to pay
this Paxton a visit, come on.

71
00:06:30,109 --> 00:06:31,792
HORSE NEIGHS

72
00:06:38,109 --> 00:06:39,929
Expecting an army?

73
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:44,188
You get out of my house now!

74
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:45,656
ROBIN LAUGHS

75
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:48,789
What's the password?

76
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:52,259
Thesaurus Patriae.
Thesaurus Patriae.

77
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,829
Nice to meet you, Paxton!

78
00:06:55,869 --> 00:07:00,149
This is Legrand
from the King's private guard.

79
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:01,829
My name is Robin Hood.

80
00:07:01,869 --> 00:07:04,189
I was afraid
you were the Sheriff's men.

81
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:08,109
I wanted to be prepared, just
in case. Do you have the message?

82
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:10,976
It's been a heavy burden
but an honour to carry it.

83
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:20,456
What's it mean?

84
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:26,751
ROBIN SNIFFS

85
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:30,210
Hang on.

86
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:45,937
What are you doing?
You'll burn 'em! Shhh.
He knows exactly what he's doing.

87
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:53,148
You see? Zaffre.

88
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:55,149
It's an element used in alchemy.

89
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:57,909
It only reveals itself
when you apply heat.

90
00:07:57,949 --> 00:07:59,456
Very clever.

91
00:08:05,549 --> 00:08:09,633
It might be clever, but it still
doesn't look like anything.

92
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:16,397
What did I tell ya?
It's all in here!

93
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:28,889
We used to bring stuff
we'd stolen here.

94
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:31,549
Grain or what-have-you,
for the poor. Good.

95
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:33,229
Bring everything.

96
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:35,880
Right, you lot,
let's get it back in the wagon.

97
00:08:38,109 --> 00:08:40,588
It's a star map,
I'm telling you. Look, Djaq.

98
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:44,129
That's the moon, this is the night
sky and those are the stars. Mmm...

99
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:46,028
No, Much, they don't work that way.

100
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:50,089
Wrong shape. That's not a moon,
anyway. It's the sun, if anything.

101
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,869
What if the dots make a circle?

102
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:54,589
Eh?

103
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:56,079
A circle.

104
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:59,959
Hang on.

105
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:04,449
Right, good.

106
00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:07,069
We're getting somewhere.
It could be a building.

107
00:09:07,109 --> 00:09:10,649
Each dot represents
a foundation stone and the sword
points to the entrance.

108
00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:13,929
But there's no clue as to what
kind of building it is or where.

109
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:15,949
WHISTLING

110
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,749
Hold, hold, hold.

111
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:20,409
WHISTLING

112
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:22,329
That might be for you.

113
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:25,549
Carry on working, I'll be back.

114
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:29,649
That signal.
Is that a member of the gang?

115
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:31,150
Something like that.

116
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:47,396
I'm up here.

117
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:02,849
I've missed you.

118
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:04,350
I've missed you too.

119
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,849
Do you know what's happening
in Locksley?

120
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:14,929
What d'you mean? Gisborne's
turned all the villagers out.

121
00:10:14,969 --> 00:10:19,689
He's made it a garrison for his
mercenaries. What about the people?
Where are the villagers?

122
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:23,557
In the forest or with families
from other villages.

123
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:28,549
Right, we'll get food to them.
You can't.

124
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:32,749
Allan told Gisborne about

125
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:35,209
If we move now, we could take
the garrison by surprise.

126
00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:36,889
I know, but...

127
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:38,549
we can't, not just yet.

128
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:40,089
Why not?!

129
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:42,289
We've had word from the King,
Marian.

130
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:46,789
I promise I'll restore Locksley
but I can't until
we complete this mission.

131
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:48,769
What are the villagers
supposed to do?

132
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:51,369
You know I would go to them
if I could.

133
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:53,655
King Richard needs me now
more than ever.

134
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:59,369
Hey... We'll be together soon.

135
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,859
I promise.

136
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:22,349
And Marian... promise me you won't
do anything in Locksley alone.

137
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:24,556
Marian? I promise.

138
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:27,932
I promise I won't do anything.

139
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:34,488
But...

140
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:36,377
the Nightwatchman might.

141
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:44,609
All right?
Yeah. What are you doing, John?

142
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:46,629
The circle of stones.

143
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:49,469
The Standing Stones, yeah? Mm-hmm.

144
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,809
The Standing Stones
at Hathersage Heath.

145
00:11:51,849 --> 00:11:53,299
I told you he'd get it!

146
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:58,709
Yeah, I'd have got that.
No, you wouldn't.

147
00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:01,449
Robin, I need to leave you now.

148
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:05,849
But I will prepare a ship
to leave tomorrow night from Hull
with the treasure.

149
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:07,889
Thank you,
the King is in your debt.

150
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:10,049
I am proud to have been of service.

151
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:13,075
Right, you lot!
To Hathersage Heath!

152
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:31,851
What sort of a place is this?

153
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:40,869
It's been here
as long as anyone can remember.

154
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:43,049
Some kind of settlement?

155
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:46,389
Or a shrine.

156
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:48,414
The sword points to that one.

157
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:56,029
These stones are all
perfectly aligned.

158
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:58,975
But what if the sword
isn't pointing north?

159
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:03,717
What if it's an instruction
to follow this line?

160
00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:29,774
Well, come on... Follow the arrow!

161
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:41,033
Look!

162
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,937
Here!

163
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:48,551
What does this mean?

164
00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:54,869
Hey.

165
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:59,589
That must be the way in.
The way in? To where?

166
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:01,989
Come on.

167
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:08,832
I knew these would come in handy.

168
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:12,549
Wait...

169
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:14,130
Come on.

170
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,269
Ah! Something I trod on just moved.

171
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:22,709
It was me!

172
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:25,749
Come on. Keep moving.

173
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:28,149
A dead end.

174
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:34,629
Wait...

175
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:36,189
Your candle's flickering.

176
00:14:36,229 --> 00:14:38,109
Fresh air is getting through.

177
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:39,829
Yeah, I can feel it.

178
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:41,319
Stand aside.

179
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:49,429
HE GRUNTS WITH EFFORT

180
00:14:49,469 --> 00:14:52,789
Legrand, you have nothing
to prove, my friend.

181
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:55,229
You'll never move it alone.
My boys.

182
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,719
Well, come on.

183
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:02,429
John, we need your help.

184
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:04,715
Right, move.

185
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,829
I loosened it.

186
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:35,319
Yeah, right.

187
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:41,769
There's light getting in
from somewhere.

188
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:43,689
It's getting stronger.

189
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:48,809
Hey, it's coming from over there.
It's almost midday.

190
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:53,519
I get it. When it's directly
overhead, it should just...

191
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:04,956
That looks like the eye on
the King's message! Wait! Wait!

192
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:09,436
Follow the line of the eye.

193
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:16,917
What is it? What is it?

194
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:21,529
Yes!

195
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:24,089
Right.

196
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:25,769
Thesaurus Patriae.

197
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:27,849
What is it?

198
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:29,849
It's another map!

199
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:33,329
It's a cross, it's at Kirklees.

200
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:35,169
Sign of the cross at Kirklees.

201
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:37,529
Kirklees Abbey. Kirklees Abbey?

202
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:39,729
How interesting!
Paxton, you traitor!

203
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:41,468
Last one there's a rotten egg!

204
00:16:41,469 --> 00:16:44,729
Stop him! Bye, Hood!

205
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:46,529
HE GRUNTS

206
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:50,889
The light's fading.
The sun's passing over.

207
00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:54,329
What now? We're trapped.

208
00:16:54,369 --> 00:16:57,129
Assemble the men,
we ride immediately.

209
00:16:57,169 --> 00:16:59,289
About the treasure.
I deserve a cut...

210
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:02,129
for services rendered.

211
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:04,256
A cut? Well...

212
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,089
Yes, if you want a cut...

213
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:09,579
a cut you shall have!

214
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:14,978
Payment in full.

215
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:20,137
To Kirklees Abbey!

216
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:10,729
Oh, great. What are you doing here?

217
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:15,689
Look, you just walk away now. No-one
needs to know you were ever here.

218
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:22,298
Guy, I've caught the Nightwatchman!
Into the lion's den, eh?

219
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:34,219
Fearless...

220
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,739
...or stupid?

221
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:44,932
Let's find out who you are.

222
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:49,735
Leave him - he's had enough, Guy!

223
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:02,537
No...

224
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:07,812
Not you.

225
00:19:19,969 --> 00:19:23,649
We only have a few hours
to get to that rendezvous point.

226
00:19:23,689 --> 00:19:26,689
And I'm sure Kirklees Abbey
is to the north of the river.

227
00:19:26,729 --> 00:19:28,909
Unless it's to the south.

228
00:19:28,949 --> 00:19:31,869
North or south, what does it matter
if we die here?

229
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:34,099
And this rock
won't move for anyone.

230
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:39,829
Go on, John.

231
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:41,979
Oh, you've got no hope.

232
00:19:43,709 --> 00:19:46,439
Come on, John. Go on.

233
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:55,290
Go on, John.

234
00:20:00,629 --> 00:20:03,989
Go on! Go on, John!

235
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:05,217
Come on! Go on, John!

236
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:08,549
Go on! Lift it!

237
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:10,870
John, get it! I don't believe it.

238
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:14,573
Come on! Yes!

239
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:18,229
Yes! Yes! Yes!

240
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:22,131
Out NOW! Go, go, go. Yes!

241
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:35,869
John, let it go, come on, John.

242
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:39,989
John, let it go... He can't.
If he does he'll be crushed.

243
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:42,560
John, push it away, come on now.

244
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:45,671
Nothing... left...

245
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:50,534
A hand?

246
00:20:54,189 --> 00:20:55,679
Come on!

247
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:04,653
Djaq, take these.

248
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:09,389
Right, to Kirklees.

249
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:11,509
The Sheriff
is going to get there first.

250
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:14,329
He's going to get the treasure.
Not if he's going the wrong way.

251
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:15,789
Kirklees Abbey, you said it.

252
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:18,749
That's before
I looked at the map properly.

253
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:21,749
Look. The cross is on
the south of the river.

254
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:25,229
The Abbey of Kirklees, the one
that we know, is on the north bank.

255
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:28,989
So, we are searching for a church
on the south side? Yeah.

256
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:31,949
The Sheriff doesn't know that.
We need to hurry.

257
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:35,129
We go across country, avoid
the roads. That means running.

258
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,029
This is for the King.

259
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:42,069
Hey...

260
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:44,196
The Sheriff's killed Paxton.

261
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:52,509
LEGRAND LAUGHS HEARTILY

262
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:13,509
Where is the treasure?

263
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:19,869
It's not at Kirklees,
so you, you find me a church
and you find it now!

264
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:47,110
Help me.

265
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:52,489
Distract them long enough
so that I can get into the forest.

266
00:22:52,529 --> 00:22:55,089
This place is surrounded. Please!

267
00:22:55,129 --> 00:22:57,740
We have to do something.
I don't have to do anything.

268
00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:02,929
I'm sorry, if I mess up
with Gisborne now,
I've got nothing left, Marian.

269
00:23:02,969 --> 00:23:05,009
I could talk to Robin for you.

270
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:06,649
You don't get it, do you?

271
00:23:06,689 --> 00:23:09,809
Even if I wanted to go back,
I couldn't, it's too late.

272
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:14,132
I've helped you wherever I can,
Marian, you know that, but this...

273
00:23:17,589 --> 00:23:20,089
A year ago

274
00:23:20,129 --> 00:23:23,320
I put this dagger
into the Nightwatchman's side.

275
00:23:25,129 --> 00:23:26,619
Show me.

276
00:23:57,589 --> 00:24:00,789
Prepare the prisoner.
We return to Nottingham.

277
00:24:00,829 --> 00:24:04,169
I've sent word to the Sheriff that
we've captured the Nightwatchman.

278
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:08,890
Guy... You... do not speak to me!

279
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:18,977
Why would the King trust something
so precious to a place like this?

280
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:23,549
That map must be
playing tricks again.

281
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:25,938
This is the only church
south of the river.

282
00:24:27,469 --> 00:24:30,814
I don't know, I think
this might be the right place.

283
00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:35,399
Wait.

284
00:24:55,489 --> 00:24:57,649
Your Majesty.

285
00:24:57,689 --> 00:25:02,189
I know you!
Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine!

286
00:25:02,229 --> 00:25:04,532
The Queen Mother!

287
00:25:08,949 --> 00:25:10,769
Thesaurus Patriae.

288
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:14,369
YOU'RE the treasure of the nation.

289
00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:16,989
Why such formality,
Robin of Locksley.

290
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:21,249
I thought we were friends!

291
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:23,490
You're late, Robin.

292
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:27,769
Apologies, Your Majesty.

293
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:29,489
We ran into a few problems.

294
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:31,228
But you're meant to be in France.

295
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:35,849
No wonder you've taken so long
to find me, Legrand, if that's
where you've been looking.

296
00:25:35,889 --> 00:25:39,568
My son Prince John invited me
to spend Christmas with him.

297
00:25:39,569 --> 00:25:44,949
Festive celebrations entailed locking
me in the tower of Pontefract Castle.

298
00:25:44,989 --> 00:25:47,348
So, Prince John announces
your allegiance to him

299
00:25:47,349 --> 00:25:50,909
and secures the army of Aquitaine
to fight against King Richard.

300
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:55,349
But you're the Queen Mother!
Less of the mother, thank you!

301
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:56,969
So...

302
00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:01,709
You are Robin Hood's famous outlaws.

303
00:26:01,749 --> 00:26:06,931
It appears you have been doing most
of the work for my son, King Richard.

304
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:11,008
And who is this?

305
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:14,629
This is Djaq from the Holy Land,
Your Majesty. Interesting.

306
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:16,469
You're a long way from home, Djaq.

307
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:19,469
Why did you choose
this particular battle here?

308
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:21,729
It chose me, Your Majesty.

309
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:25,209
I fight here with my friends.

310
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:28,429
I should like to know you better.

311
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:31,136
I'm Much, Your Majesty.

312
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:34,978
And this is, er...

313
00:26:36,749 --> 00:26:39,069
Will.
Will.

314
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:41,069
Of course.

315
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:43,149
But who is this fellow?

316
00:26:43,189 --> 00:26:46,709
This, Your Majesty, is Little John.

317
00:26:46,749 --> 00:26:50,949
Little? I can't believe
there's a part of you that's little!

318
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:54,748
I need a man like you
around the castle in Aquitaine.

319
00:26:54,749 --> 00:26:56,250
We will talk later.

320
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:00,010
Behind me, Your Majesty!

321
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:04,829
It's time to leave!
That's the only way out of here.
Here we go again.

322
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:08,229
Provision has been made
for all eventualities.

323
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:11,909
This leads directly
to Barnsdale Forest.

324
00:27:11,949 --> 00:27:16,629
Perhaps you would do the honour.
You... big bear.

325
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:19,749
HE MOUTHS

326
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:22,274
Stop banging, you blithering oafs.

327
00:27:25,949 --> 00:27:31,269
There is no escape.
My men are all over the forest.

328
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:35,749
You're too late, Sheriff.
This treasure is ours.

329
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:38,389
Oh.

330
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:40,829
And what a national treasure it is.

331
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:43,589
Who is that man? Sheriff of
Nottingham. Love the dress.

332
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:45,669
You'd better come with me.

333
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:48,769
What? So you can hold her
to ransom in the tower?

334
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:49,909
I don't think so.

335
00:27:49,949 --> 00:27:56,869
That man is a sworn enemy
of the state and especially
your son, Prince John.

336
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:59,829
Alas, one can choose one's friends
but not one's family.

337
00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:01,389
You and John deserve each other.

338
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,429
Oh, then,

339
00:28:03,469 --> 00:28:07,148
alas, you shall never
leave England alive.

340
00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:13,508
Are you always this odious
or have you just practised for me?

341
00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:16,389
Oh, you haven't seen
the half of it.

342
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:20,689
Open this door! Let's go, come on!
Open this door!

343
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:27,049
My, what strong arms you have.
Stop! Open this door, now!

344
00:28:27,089 --> 00:28:29,199
Open this door!

345
00:28:37,769 --> 00:28:39,179
DOOR OPENS

346
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:46,769
Please...
You're in league with Robin Hood.

347
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:50,389
An outlaw. I warned you,
the sentence would be death.

348
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:54,749
I was the Nightwatchman
years before Robin returned.
Don't take me for a fool!

349
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:58,669
It all fits.
The way you behaved with me,
your little rides into the forest.

350
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:01,469
You were trusted here
at the castle by all of us. I know.

351
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:05,909
Every moment that I thought
you were a friend to me,
you were betraying me. I wasn't...

352
00:29:05,949 --> 00:29:10,589
Every day that I grew more and more
to love you, you were mocking me.

353
00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:13,409
It wasn't like that,
I cared for you!

354
00:29:13,449 --> 00:29:15,148
I still care for you.

355
00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:17,269
Shhh...

356
00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:20,557
You are a liar.

357
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:27,269
I stayed at your side

358
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:30,149
when Prince John's men
were threatening Nottingham.

359
00:29:30,189 --> 00:29:31,650
I could easily have left you!

360
00:29:38,469 --> 00:29:40,409
You are nothing to me.

361
00:29:40,449 --> 00:29:43,229
So, you would rather
I was put to death?

362
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:46,829
Lose everything
we've ever had or ever could have?

363
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:48,831
I've lost
far more than that already.

364
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,809
Oh, I must rest.
I can't run any more.

365
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:04,689
We really shouldn't, Your Majesty.

366
00:30:04,729 --> 00:30:07,078
The Sheriff's men
could be on us at any minute.

367
00:30:08,689 --> 00:30:10,179
A few moments, then.

368
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:18,209
Oh...

369
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:19,368
Robin.

370
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:24,929
You gave up a life of ease to be
hunted down like a common outlaw.

371
00:30:24,969 --> 00:30:26,809
Strange choice.

372
00:30:26,849 --> 00:30:32,918
It's an easy choice...

373
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:37,509
I speak out of turn, I'm sorry.

374
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:39,511
Do you always seek out trouble?

375
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:42,709
No.

376
00:30:42,749 --> 00:30:44,509
Trouble has a habit of finding me.

377
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:47,049
It's the attraction of excitement.

378
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:49,528
Like the excitement of attraction.

379
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:51,019
What do you say?

380
00:30:52,229 --> 00:30:54,569
I, er...

381
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:56,609
I like the quiet ones. Find them!

382
00:30:56,649 --> 00:30:59,668
Shhhh! Find them now.

383
00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:01,170
You're a tracker - track!

384
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:06,709
It's the Sheriff.
I can't run any more.

385
00:31:06,749 --> 00:31:08,449
John?

386
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:17,629
Apologies, Your Majesty.

387
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:20,409
Please! I'm rather enjoying myself.

388
00:31:20,449 --> 00:31:22,809
HE LAUGHS

389
00:31:29,689 --> 00:31:32,369
Marian?

390
00:31:32,409 --> 00:31:34,451
Get the door open!

391
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:40,809
She's escaped! Guards! Stop her.

392
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:43,729
Marian!

393
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:46,209
Allan, stop her! Get out of my way!

394
00:31:47,769 --> 00:31:49,259
You little fool!

395
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:58,769
Did you expect me to sit here
and wait to be executed?

396
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:02,488
I expect you to know
when you're beaten.

397
00:32:02,489 --> 00:32:04,269
Get out.

398
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:07,229
Get out!

399
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:09,936
This isn't a game, Marian.

400
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:15,029
When the Sheriff returns,
you are going to die.

401
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:18,509
Don't you have the courage
to finish this yourself?

402
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:22,129
After all my so-called betrayals,

403
00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:24,489
you should be glad to do it.

404
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:28,389
This is not my decision.
Then perhaps it should be.

405
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:31,469
After all, you were the one
who professed to love me.

406
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:34,749
I thought that I knew you.
But this is me!

407
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:36,429
This is who I am!

408
00:32:36,469 --> 00:32:38,269
The Nightwatchman. Everything.

409
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:40,049
You say you love me
and you don't know me.

410
00:32:40,089 --> 00:32:43,749
I defended you against the Sheriff
countless times, more than you know.

411
00:32:43,789 --> 00:32:47,809
And I deceived the Sheriff
to help people and in so doing
I had to deceive you.

412
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:49,891
And I'm sorry for that.

413
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:53,789
But is it such a crime
to follow my heart?

414
00:32:53,829 --> 00:32:56,188
The way I have followed mine?

415
00:32:56,189 --> 00:32:58,896
And always to your door!

416
00:33:00,489 --> 00:33:05,229
Marian, why did you have to put me
in this position?

417
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:11,839
Did you even once understand
what I was feeling or thinking?

418
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:22,469
When you left, I thought that
I'd lost you for good.

419
00:33:22,509 --> 00:33:26,269
Perhaps it would've been better
if I had.

420
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:35,918
We keep heading east.

421
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:52,370
What is it? Why have we stopped?

422
00:34:00,269 --> 00:34:03,809
This, my lady, is an ambush.

423
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:06,937
Such a charming scene.

424
00:34:08,669 --> 00:34:11,249
Thank you, big bear.

425
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:17,749
I presume for the right price,
Sheriff, you'd be willing
to let us go?

426
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:22,349
No, no, no, Your Majesty, you're
worth far more to me than jewels.

427
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:24,269
You do not scare me.

428
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:26,269
Oh, such spirit.

429
00:34:26,309 --> 00:34:28,189
Bring her and kill the rest.

430
00:34:28,229 --> 00:34:29,989
And him.

431
00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:31,377
Legrand!

432
00:34:50,749 --> 00:34:53,320
For the Queen! For the Queen!

433
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:00,997
Why is nothing ever simple!?

434
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:07,029
This way.

435
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:09,789
Get down and stay down!

436
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:11,949
M'lady.

437
00:35:11,989 --> 00:35:13,814
Well, come on, big bear!

438
00:35:31,069 --> 00:35:32,149
Stay down!

439
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:01,930
Up now!

440
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:17,049
A stronger man, I never knew.

441
00:36:17,089 --> 00:36:20,789
The Queen. Legrand.

442
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:22,996
HE LAUGHS

443
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:35,119
Him... I liked.

444
00:36:53,429 --> 00:36:55,409
The treasure prove elusive?

445
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:57,457
Don't be smug, Gisborne.

446
00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:02,589
Where's the Nightwatchman?
I can feel a hanging coming on.

447
00:37:02,629 --> 00:37:06,509
Determined to get something
out of today... Ah, Marian.

448
00:37:06,549 --> 00:37:11,829
Just in time for a little
entertainment - we're going to
execute the Nightwatchman.

449
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:14,229
I am ready.

450
00:37:19,949 --> 00:37:22,969
The Nightwatchman -
he is supposed to be behind bars!

451
00:37:23,009 --> 00:37:24,573
He's escaped! Get after him!

452
00:38:08,649 --> 00:38:09,911
Good news, Gisborne.

453
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,849
Only good news.

454
00:38:13,889 --> 00:38:17,409
Tell me you've caught him, tell me
you're ready to string him up.

455
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:20,929
Tell me I can have my execution!

456
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:22,809
He escaped.

457
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:24,969
The Nightwatchman is gone.

458
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:27,437
You have failed me again!

459
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:38,472
There is too much at stake now.
A kingdom!

460
00:38:40,656 --> 00:38:42,863
Last chance, Gisborne.

461
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:01,319
You should follow the road
down to the coast.

462
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,802
There'll be a boat moored
at the headlands.

463
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:09,839
And Legrand's men will sail you
to your friends in Ireland and then
back on to France. Poor Legrand.

464
00:39:09,879 --> 00:39:12,919
We'll give him a proper burial.

465
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:15,759
Don't worry. He was a hero,

466
00:39:15,799 --> 00:39:18,359
as are you all. Thank you.

467
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:22,602
King Richard will know of your
bravery and sacrifice in helping me.

468
00:39:24,339 --> 00:39:25,840
Your Majesty.

469
00:39:32,919 --> 00:39:35,444
Remember your invitation, big bear.

470
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,047
My contribution.

471
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,338
Your Majesty,

472
00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:47,679
I can't take this! I am rich.

473
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,959
The poor are poor.

474
00:39:49,999 --> 00:39:51,802
Isn't that where you come in?

475
00:39:59,459 --> 00:40:02,110
Right, lads, come on.

476
00:40:14,419 --> 00:40:15,681
HE COUGHS

477
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:20,123
KNOCK ON DOOR

478
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:24,130
Come in.

479
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:29,139
Guy. You're safe.

480
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:31,299
You did this for me? Eh...

481
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:37,619
Both of you.
Well, what's being chased by angry
soldiers between friends, eh?

482
00:40:37,659 --> 00:40:40,899
Burn that.
The Nightwatchman is no more.

483
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,899
You will not get another chance.
I've heard that one before.

484
00:40:43,939 --> 00:40:45,685
I didn't ask for your opinion.

485
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:49,519
Thank you.

486
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:52,120
You saved my life.

487
00:40:59,299 --> 00:41:01,085
After everything you said?

488
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:05,699
You don't know me
as well as you think.

489
00:41:05,739 --> 00:41:08,419
Guy...
Will you do something for me now?

490
00:41:08,459 --> 00:41:09,909
Name it.

491
00:41:11,459 --> 00:41:15,361
Stay... and make this place bearable.

492
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:19,522
I will stay.

493
00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:23,428
Thank you.

494
00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:36,139
You know,
there's something about Sherwood.

495
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:38,599
It's home. Yeah.

496
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:39,600
Oh!

497
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:44,219
Come on. It's nearly sunset.

498
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:48,419
And I know plenty of people
who will be grateful
of Queen Eleanor's money.

499
00:41:48,459 --> 00:41:50,579
So, John,

500
00:41:50,619 --> 00:41:54,019
planning on visiting Aquitaine
any time soon?

501
00:41:54,059 --> 00:41:58,159
The Queen Mother fancies you!
ALL: Big bear!

502
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:01,959
You're all jealous!
LAUGHTER

503
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:08,298
Happy Birthday!

504
00:42:08,299 --> 00:42:09,379
Homeward.

505
00:42:10,539 --> 00:42:13,939
We're surrounded.
Marian, I'm going away. Where?

506
00:42:13,979 --> 00:42:16,299
The Holy Land? Is this
what I think it is?

507
00:42:16,339 --> 00:42:17,579
Let's go and kill a king.

508
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:19,978
We need to get out of here now.

509
00:42:19,979 --> 00:42:22,378
Your Majesty. Robin of Loxley.

510
00:42:22,379 --> 00:42:25,639
We are going to get King Richard
to kill Robin Hood.

511
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:28,870
Kill the Sheriff
and I will reward you.
