SHERWOOD FOREST

00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,000
Gone to meet his Maker.

3
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,000
- Get rid of him.
- Just seeing if he's got a purse.

4
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,770
I'll show you my purse
if you show me yours.

5
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,600
This is an ambush.

6
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,400
- You don't say.
- This is how it goes.

7
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,945
There's poor people going hungry.
Tell us what you've got...

8
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:15,425
- be honest with us.
- And we take one tenth...

9
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,900
- so the poor can eat.
- Lie...

10
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,000
- or resist
- And we take it all.

11
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,570
So what's it gonna be?

12
00:01:39,025 --> 00:01:41,800
Well, what have we got here?

13
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,400
My babies.

14
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,875
Get them.

15
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,450
- I don't wanna hurt you
- Oh, sure you was.

16
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,180
I've got the girl.

17
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:14,175
Time to disappear!

18
00:02:14,245 --> 00:02:17,251
My gang, this way!

19
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,200
The woman you'll find.

20
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,530
Where did they go?

21
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,050
Gone to meet their Makers.

22
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,650
Take me to Nottingham. Idiots.

23
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,350
Come on.

24
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,500
- Great work, Will.
- That was nothing.

25
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,000
Nothing?
Jesus. I love our camp!

NOTTINGHAM CASTLE

38
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:12,550
Tell me. You would rather
have a woman, Gisborne?

39
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,500
Tell me, you would rather
have a woman...

40
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,500
than all this... power?

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,500
We are so close.

42
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,150
Indeed.

43
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,100
Talking of our lady, 
leperfriend..

44
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:33,170
it's time to go get
the pretty one and her daddy.

45
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,700
Edward and Marian.

46
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:40,350
If they resist, shall I use force?

47
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,050
Get them to speak, Gisborne.

48
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,400
Use force anyway.

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,500
- How're we doing, Allan?
- Could have been nasty.

50
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,820
OUTLAW'S CAMP

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
- Those men were well trained.
- Woman wasn't bad.

52
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,000
- Nearly had you for a minute there?
- No. I doubt that.

53
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,350
- What's that?
- Boss-lady's ring.

54
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,150
I know it.

55
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,250
That's the Sheriff's insignia.

56
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,550
So what?

57
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,750
What, we robbed
a friend of the Sheriff.

58
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,200
It is more than a friend
if she shares the Sheriff's insignia.

59
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,450
Ah, the glamorous one.

60
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
The successful one.

61
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,950
So... so, how was your journey?

62
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,650
I ran into an old friend of yours.

63
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,850
Hood.

64
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,100
- He didn't hurt your babies?
- No.

65
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,900
- But I do want him caught.
- Don't worry.

66
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,250
Everything is in place.
Tomorrow, when our friends gather...

67
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,500
they gather to watch him die.

68
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,550
- The plan is?
- The whole garrison, 400 men.

69
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,300
Men is good...

70
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:23,400
But a woman... is better.

71
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,470
KNIGHTON HALL

72
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,250
And that's all I'm taking off
until you go away.

73
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,251
You are spoil sport, Marian.

74
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,152
What do you make of this?

75
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,900
The Sheriff's insignia.

76
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,500
We took it off a woman
on her way to Nottingham today.

77
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,080
And she had men,
and they were well trained.

78
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
It was like a military unit.

79
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,450
And she's been granted
the Sheriff's insignia.

80
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,850
- And what does that mean?
- I don't know.

81
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,150
I was hoping you or
your father might know.

82
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,100
I get the feeling we're not too
welcome in the corridors of power.

83
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,000
Good.

84
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,300
Come and join my gang.

85
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,750
- In your dreams.
- Wait.

86
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Listen.

87
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,950
- Did you hear it?
- What?

88
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,180
- That kiss spoke volumes.
- Did it?

89
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,300
What did it say?

90
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,450
It said...

91
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,651
"Marian wants to come
and join your gang."

92
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Really?

93
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,720
That's not what I heard.

94
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,250
What I heard was
a little voice saying...

95
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,550
"Abandon your home,
abandon your father...

96
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,200
give up any hope
of a normal life and...

97
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,600
take up arms with a man who thinks...

98
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,900
resistance is about
showing off with the bow."

99
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
- That's not fair.
- And to do what?

100
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,801
To wait for a king, who lets face it,
may or may not make it home.

101
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,200
What?

102
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,770
See, I've been thinking about it then.

103
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,650
Sir Edward, Marian!
Out, now!

104
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,800
Sir Guy!

105
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,900
- Halt there!
- I'm gonna kill him.

106
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,100
- You shoot first, think later.
- I will not allow this.

107
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,170
- Do you want my father killed?
- Marian!

108
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
Who'll give you respect,
when you do nothing?

109
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,400
Come down now or
I'll torch your house!

110
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:55,150
- Do you respect me?
- Don't keep me waiting!

111
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,900
I respect you.

112
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,620
- Father!
- You come when I say!

113
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
- I'm unhurt.
- What do you want?

114
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,980
You're coming to the castle. Sheriff
wants you, where he can see you.

115
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,100
No, we're not!
My father is frail, release him!

116
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,800
You do not tell me what to do!

117
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,900
- Burn the house.
- Guy, no.

118
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,900
- Please, sir Guy.
- Better.

119
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,700
Sir Guy?

120
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,650
Beg!

121
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,250
Sir Guy. Please, I beg you...

122
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,050
Much better.

123
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
But still not good enough.

124
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,070
No!

125
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,000
Come on! To the castle, move it!

126
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,500
Come on, you did it to us!
Do something!

127
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,350
Move out!

128
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,130
NOTTINGHAM TOWN

129
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Something's up.
That is proper lockdown.

130
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,100
Can't just be freight with Marian.

131
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,150
Now, who is that?

132
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,700
Why not just knock on
the door and ask the Sheriff?

133
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,500
We're not gonna find that much standing
around here all morning, are we?

134
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
What do you recommend?

135
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,150
Since you ask,
I was gonna go to the tavern...

136
00:11:04,151 --> 00:11:06,151
Some new tricks I wanna try,
here look at this...

137
00:11:06,152 --> 00:11:09,100
- Three cups, right?
- Come on.

138
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,350
No, no, come on.
Robin, this is lovely. Honest.

139
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,150
Since when have we been
tavern tricksters, Allan?

140
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,100
Didn't it get all funny about Marian,
why did you let Gisborne...

141
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,470
- grab her in the first place?
- Be careful.

142
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,800
The sanctimonious old fart...

143
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,100
and her father.

144
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,802
I gather you've been callous
with the wood fire.

145
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,203
- You know full well that is not the case.
- Tell me...

146
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,400
Who's side are you on?
Mine or King Richard's?

147
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,050
The real world or the old world?

148
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,070
Yours.

149
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:59,350
Come along. We both know
that's not true, do we?

150
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,550
I believe in justice. I believe
in the rights of the free men.

151
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,400
Who cares what you believe in?

152
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:12,350
I have a plan...
and I will not tolerate descent.

153
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,700
So...

154
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,250
You are under house arrest,
here in the castle.

155
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,400
Until I can find some use for you.

156
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,901
- My Lord Sheriff, I must protest.
- You must?

157
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,370
My father is unwell.
He must be allowed to stay...

158
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,450
One more word out of you missy...

159
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,000
and your father
will never be unwell again.

160
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,900
My Lord. Another one of
our friends has arrived.

161
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,950
Good.

162
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,950
Guy!

163
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,400
Please.

164
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,950
The castle is
no place for an old man.

165
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,650
You think you can humiliate
a man at the altar?

166
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:56,500
A man like me, and get away with it?
You're wrong.

167
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
- Marian's in there.
- Yeah, she's probably having...

168
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,300
- cakes and ale with the Sheriff.
- You just don't get it, do you?

169
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,301
No. I don't get anything.
That's what I'm saying.

170
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,000
You know, we risk our lives to get
money, then we give all of it away.

171
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,000
What's that about? I'm not being
funny. We should get something.

172
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,070
If we don't get anything
we're gonna get weak...

173
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,140
get demoralized. Then how
are we gonna help the poor?

174
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,200
- You're not weak.
- No, but I might get weak.

175
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,070
- Anyway, it doesn't matter to you.
- Why?

176
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,150
You've always been weak.

177
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Very funny.

178
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,150
You know, why don't you just...?

179
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
- Just!
- Why don't I just what?

180
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,050
- Why don't you just jigger off?
- Jigger off?

181
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,300
You what?
What does that mean, jigger?

182
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,500
- You know what it means.
- What?

183
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,400
What? Where are you going?

184
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,800
- Master?
- Just let him go.

185
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,950
He needs to cool off.

186
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,251
We've forgotten about the poor today.
We said we'd be here to hand down.

187
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,252
The Sheriff's not
forgotten about them.

188
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,900
Look at that... folk woman.

189
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,700
Caught her to that old pile and
try to humiliate one of them.

190
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,701
For now, we'll try the west gate.
Come on.

191
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,700
All right.

192
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,703
- Just that your wages?
- What's it to you?

193
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:37,800
I thought you might fancy
doubling your money.

194
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
There's another one.

195
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
I know that man.

196
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Foster of Rotheram.

197
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,000
- Who is he?
- He's a schemer.

198
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,000
And he's nasty and
he's an enemy of the King.

199
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,400
The day Foster and the Sheriff get
together is a blood day for England.

200
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,901
And if all those visitors
are the same, then...

201
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,600
Go back to the camp and
tell the others to get ready.

202
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,770
And tell them the castle is
locked down. And tell Will...

203
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,850
to think of a way
to get over that wall.

204
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,100
Where are you going?

205
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:19,501
What if we get in,
we'll need uniforms.

206
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,000
- Why do you offence?
- I need your uniform.

207
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,500
I'm not being funny.
Cost me money every time.

208
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,700
Oh! Shame, shame.

209
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,250
Thank you very much.

210
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,100
Oh! Unlucky, unlucky.
Another go? Have another go!

211
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,880
Unlucky.

212
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Felt you but might.

213
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,300
Gotcha.

214
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
This is the Sheriff's work?

215
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
Just go away.

216
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:24,800
Look, I don't want any sympathy
and I don' want any monkey food...

217
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,670
thrown at me. So, unless
you've got a better idea, go away.

218
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,450
- Ma'am. How about I rescue you?
- No, thanks.

219
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm Robin Hood.

220
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,500
Really?

221
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,450
No, thanks. I'm taking
a punishment for my children.

222
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,700
They were caught stealing
scraps from the castle kitchens.

223
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,701
Go on, shoo.

224
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,950
I've got to stay or they get it.

225
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,300
It's just for a day.
So do me a favor and get lost.

226
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,370
If you and your children
need extra food...

227
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,440
my men and I can help.
Every few days...

228
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,930
we bring those who need
a little food or money.

229
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,300
I can add you to our list.

230
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,650
- If you give me your name.
- What? You think...

231
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,420
because you've given me a coin
I'm gonna tell you my name?

232
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
I have to go. You don't have
to give me your name.

233
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:14,201
Just be on the market on Thursdays.
My men'll find you.

234
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,200
Hey!

235
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,050
Rose.

236
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,230
My name is Rose.

237
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,450
Thank you.

238
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,850
Excellent, my tiny tricksters.

239
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,350
Now, where's Gisborne?

240
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,550
Tell Gisborne it's showtime.

241
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,450
Good. Very good.

242
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,100
What?

243
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,350
What do you want?

244
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,700
So, tell me...

245
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,850
- Where are your friends?
- What are you talking about?

246
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,100
Oh, not this again.

247
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,700
You think I'm one of
Robin Hood's men, don't ya?

248
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,400
One who looks like me,
what's his name?

249
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,750
Allan, right?
No, no. My name's Tom.

250
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,900
Tom.

251
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,901
Don't insult me.

252
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,602
What's happened?
Robin Hood kick you out?

253
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,820
Tricky working within taverns doesn't
sound very Robin Hood to me.

254
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,900
I told you, I don't know Robin Hood.

255
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,801
Show me some respect and maybe
we can talk about a deal.

256
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,000
Sir Guy.
Sheriff says it's showtime.

257
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,550
Torture him.

258
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,100
Hang on! I admit, all right?
I'm Allan-a-Dale.

259
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Too late.

260
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,350
Come on, a deal? You said a deal!

261
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,420
Too late. No need anymore.

262
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,500
People.

263
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,750
My dear people.

264
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,450
There two young scallywags here
think because they are children...

265
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
They can escape justice.

266
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,200
They have committed a crime.

267
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,601
One of my men saw fit...

268
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,550
to take pity on them
and their mother...

269
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,500
and allowed her to take
a punishment for them.

270
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,150
Very generous but misguided.

271
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,650
They must lose a hand.

272
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,850
<i>No.</i>

273
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
- It is the law.
- No.

274
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,700
No! My children, no!

275
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,050
Motherly compassion.
The sweet charming.

276
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,350
Bring out the equipment.

277
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,550
Please, they didn't...
they meant no harm.

278
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,000
- Please, don't take their hands.
- Shut up!

279
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,700
Come along. Chop, chop.

280
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
I, Vaizey...

281
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,350
Sheriff of Nottingham, hereby
pronounce sentence of...

282
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,250
Little Tiny Billy and Tiny Little Jay
blah-di-blah-di-blah...

283
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,550
Chop off their hands.

284
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,900
Somebody save my children!

285
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,400
Touch those children and there's
an arrow here for you, Sheriff!

286
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,470
Do it.

287
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Rose! Children!

288
00:21:01,472 --> 00:21:04,272
- Run!
- They can't! Help!

289
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,420
No, Robin. Don't go down.

290
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,950
The locks, quickly!

291
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,650
Now!

292
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,800
Clever.

293
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,900
- Very, very clever.
- Put down your weapon, Hood.

294
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,400
So... tell me.

295
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,201
- Are these even your children?
- Children?

296
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,080
Now.

297
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,100
You show me your face...

298
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,700
and I'll show you mine.

299
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:23,301
Did I tell you I had a sister, Hood?

300
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
My friends.

301
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,400
Our time has come.

302
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,500
King Richard is marching on Jerusalem.

303
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,350
By the time the year is out
he will be home.

304
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,900
So...

305
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:57,100
Operation "Shah mat" must
move to the next phase.

306
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,050
Mobilize your men.
Bring me your bids for funding.

307
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,150
We must be ready.

308
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,830
Wherever King Richard
lands on English soil...

309
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,600
we must be there to greet him,
to embrace him.

310
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,601
Oh, our king is dead.

311
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,850
Long live the King.

312
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,000
So, meanwhile...
today's entertainment.

313
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,600
My friends. Allow me to introduce...

314
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,901
From high lord, to low criminal.

315
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,602
From noble, to nothing.

316
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,930
From rank, to skank.

317
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,604
From hero, to zero.

318
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,450
Robin Hood.

319
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,551
Welcome to my new chamber, Hood.

320
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,670
We are the Black Knights.

321
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,400
Why so coy, Vaizey?

322
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,900
Why not call yourselves the traitors?

323
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:01,800
An operation "Shah mat"?
Why not call it "Checkmate"?

324
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,800
- Or better still, "Kill the King"?
- Very good. He knows his Persian.

325
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:09,220
- Very clever.
- The taxes. The money you've raised.

326
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,200
What did you think? Did you think
I was gonna buy myself a new rug?

327
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:15,000
You don't know me at all, Hood.

328
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,550
Myself and my friends,
we have no interest in money.

329
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,650
It's for an army of mercenaries.

330
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,800
We want power.

331
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,070
Between us we will
run the new England.

332
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,100
- We are the new England.
- Well then God help us.

333
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,800
Yes, what God is he when
he can't help you now. Shame.

334
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,700
Because I really rather
enjoyed thy little skirmishes.

335
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,450
Davida.

336
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,070
My babies.

337
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Death by fang.

338
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,500
- Listen, this can make it so...
- Surely.

339
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,750
How about little pay?

340
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,250
You're paid man,
how about a little wager?

341
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,300
That's no, by the way.

342
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,950
Inch by inch, Hood...

343
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,980
you'll be lowered to your death.

344
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:53,150
My friend sir Guy would like
to ask you a question...

345
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,220
before we say good bye.

346
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,900
Tell me, Hood.

347
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,100
Who is the Nightwatchman?

348
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
I don't know, Gisborne.

349
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:10,800
But I do know I'll kiss him when
I see him, for stealing from you.

350
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,150
And for showing, it's not just me.

351
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,900
You see, there are people like me...

352
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,650
and the Nightwatchman,
all over England...

353
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,951
who will stand up for justice.

354
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:31,000
<i>Look here. An enlightenment
player through the wood.</i>

355
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,300
For what?

356
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,320
So you could be King of the paupers?

357
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,121
Do you think they'd love you?

358
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,230
Did you think they'd
kneel to your name?

359
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
Trust me.

360
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,550
You're not dead yet,
they forgot you already.

361
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,550
- The Nightwatchman.
- What?

362
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,950
The Nightwatchman! Get after him!

363
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,500
A double execution! Very good.

364
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,170
My friends. I suggest
you retire to your quarters...

365
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,250
and we reconvene tonight.

366
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Thank you.

367
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,500
So, handsome.

368
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,700
I almost regret tricking you now.

369
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,000
A clue, no.

370
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,920
Remember this, Nightwatchman?

371
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,050
Take off your mask.
I wanna see your face when you die.

372
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,800
Mistake, my friend. You should
have run when you had the chance.

373
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,900
Get up, you idiots!

374
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,200
Gisborne!

375
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,401
- Get him!
- Don't worry. He's mine.

376
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,900
What's the matter?
Does nobody love you?

377
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,180
That's your real weakness, isn't it?

378
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,150
You need people to love you.

379
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,250
It's better than needing
reptiles to love you.

380
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,931
- My brother loves me.
- Like I said.

381
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,650
Looks like you're gonna die
without an audience, Hood.

382
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,080
Think, think!

383
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,700
What's he doing?

384
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,600
Why's he running away?

385
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,550
He's creating a distraction!

386
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,400
You're wasting your time, my friend!

387
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,700
Robin Hood is already dead!

388
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,880
Yes.

389
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,120
Impressive.

390
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,100
What were you thinking
you would do, if you did escape?

391
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:39,500
Between us, we have 10 000 men.

392
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,501
What was your plan?

393
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,250
Were you going to save England,
single-handed?

394
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,000
Not single-handed.
There's five or six of us.

395
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,750
Help.

396
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,410
Help.

397
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,950
Get me out!

398
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,340
Get me out!

399
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,750
Help! Get me out!

400
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,380
- Davida?
- Brother?

401
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,550
What have you done? Would you get
my sister out of there, right now!

402
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,700
Don't make any sudden...

403
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,000
movements.

404
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,401
Get her out. Get her out!

405
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,650
There must be a cure.
Some medicine, yes?

406
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,000
- No.
- Sheriff?

407
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,100
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you now...

408
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,970
- and put an end to your treason?
- Shut up, Hood.

409
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,080
Then you die with your sister.

410
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,150
You haven't told him, have you?

411
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,370
Prince John has made
the Sheriff a promise.

412
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:09,500
If my brother should die
an unnatural death...

413
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:15,300
then the county of Nottingham and
everything in it shall be obliterated.

414
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,650
Every town and village will be burned.

415
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,700
Every man, every woman...

416
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:29,000
and every innocent
little child, hanged.

417
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,800
Would you lay all that
on your conscience...

418
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,200
pretty boy?

419
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,600
So long.

420
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:50,930
Don't die.

421
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,250
You're strong.
You're my strong sister.

422
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,750
I'm not strong.

423
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,551
I was being you...

424
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,552
so you'd notice me.

425
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,753
So you'd...

426
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,870
love me.

427
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,960
I love you.

428
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,756
I've always loved you.

429
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,950
I want him dead.

430
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,000
Gisborne, whatever it takes,
I want him... dead.

431
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,800
NOTTINGHAM TOWN

432
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:01,450
- Robin?
- Who died?

433
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,520
You did.
The Sheriff said you were dead.

434
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,450
The Sheriff.

435
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,520
The Sheriff
has plotted to kill the King.

436
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
With his friends, the Black knights.

437
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,100
They're already dividing
England between themselves.

438
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,800
- You can't go back into the castle.
- We must get word to the King.

439
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,370
- Nottingham is not safe.
- It's not just Nottingham.

440
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:20,750
Black knights.
The Black knights, they're everywhere.

441
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,250
They're taxing the poor unto
pay for an army of mercenaries.

442
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,880
Wouldn't we stop them?
I must go back to the castle.

443
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,960
It's too dangerous.

444
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,770
Having a spy on the inside when
there's a coup being plotted is useful.

445
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,400
- No. For once, just listen to me.
- And my father is in there.

446
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,730
- Robin, I have to go back.
- Marian...

447
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,130
- I can't protect you in the castle.
- Two minutes ago...

448
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,200
I thought you were dead and
I would have given anything...

449
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:43,430
- for another chance to be with you.
- Well then take that chance.

450
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,680
And come with me.

451
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,300
- Listen.
- What?

452
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,730
Little voice, saying yes.

453
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,531
When the King is home, safe.

454
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,632
Hood. You have failed saying goodbye.

455
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,850
Take aim.

456
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:22,623
What?

457
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,770
No more public humiliation, Gisborne?

458
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,150
- No more beating and parading?
- The Sheriff doesn't wanna...

459
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,970
say goodbye either.
He just wants you dead now.

460
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:38,471
See you on the dark side.
Shoot him!

461
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So it is good night from me.

462
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,101
And good night from me.

463
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,750
Guards!

464
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,620
What!

465
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,700
Pepper. Ouch!

466
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:02,650
You see, Gisborne?
That's why I didn't say goodbye.

467
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,100
Because I did wanna see you cry.

468
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,430
- Time to disappear?
- Yeah.

469
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,200
My gang. This way, come on.

470
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,530
We're having fun.

471
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,300
Hood was, did you know...

472
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,200
Didn't try and rescue you.

473
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,350
So, I was thinking...

474
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:42,000
- One chance to live.
- I will not help you kill Robin.

475
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:46,450
- M'not helping you kill anyone.
- Yeah, I respect you for that.

476
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,451
So lets look at this
another way, shall we?

477
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,700
An exchange. As we go along.

478
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,680
Little information, a little money...

479
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,650
a conversation.

480
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
- What sort of conversation?
- Oh, harmless one.

481
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,500
If I need extra guards
in a building, you let me know.

482
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,401
If I need to reroute a convoy.

483
00:39:12,402 --> 00:39:14,402
That sort of conversation.

484
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,950
I am not robbed.

485
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,310
Robin is not killed.

486
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,830
In between us pulls a service.

487
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
You and I.

488
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,900
We are the ones, who make our
supposed betters look good.

489
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,520
And they take us for granted.

490
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,950
But what happens when they move on?

491
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,750
Then it's our turn.

492
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,751
You wanna help the poor?

493
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,400
Help yourself first.

494
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,401
Make provision for the future.

495
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,000
You'll never be named,
you'll never be implicated.

496
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,400
This is just between you and me.

497
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,800
You'll be my eyes and my ears.

498
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,830
And when all this is over...

499
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:14,830
You will have money and position.

500
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,030
And you can help the poor
they hearts content.

501
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
It's not the end of the world, is it?

502
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:35,110
I mean Marian's all right,
basically and...

503
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,930
- We've got a camp.
- Much.

504
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,400
The Sheriff and the Black knights
are gonna kill the King.

505
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,830
- Take over England.
- Huh, true.

506
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,040
It is the end of the world.

507
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,070
But if we have learned one thing
today it's that you're never going...

508
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,150
to Nottingham alone again, ever.

509
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,900
Because if you had died,
especially now...

510
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
If I had died...

511
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,540
today, Much.

512
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,140
Or if I die tomorrow,
you'll carry on without me.

513
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:08,400
- How? We are Robin Hood's men.
- No. You are Robin Hood.

514
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,700
- What?
- You're all Robin Hood.

515
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,000
And you are, and you are.
All of you.

516
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:18,250
- We're not that, are we?
- Listen to me. Listen.

517
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,740
We are not just six
outlaws in the forest.

518
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,000
We are the spirit of England
and that is Robin Hood.

519
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,600
And that lads, that...

520
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,620
is this country's only hope.

521
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,200
We are Robin Hood. Come on.

522
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,070
Hi, old lads.

523
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:42,071
What happened to you?

524
00:41:42,072 --> 00:41:44,872
- Trick one panacea me.
- Or I could have told you.

525
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:50,000
- We are Robin Hood.
- What?

526
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,230
Just say it.

527
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,650
We are Robin Hood!

528
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,550
<i>NEXT TIME</i>

529
