1
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,229
- What have you got for me?
- Nothing.

2
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:39,299
- You killed Roger of Stoke.
- Allan...

3
00:00:40,162 --> 00:00:43,260
You knew I'd kill him. You Just
didn't want to admit it to yourself.

4
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,239
- You're low.
- Yeah.

5
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:49,281
And YOU are here for more money.
So what do you want to tell me?

6
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:51,239
You've got a messenger.

7
00:00:51,547 --> 00:00:54,598
Henry of Lewes,
arriving tomorrow, right?

8
00:00:56,158 --> 00:00:59,096
- How do you know that?
- He's coming to tell you where and when

9
00:00:59,216 --> 00:01:02,002
the King plans to land
when he returns to England.

10
00:01:02,302 --> 00:01:04,868
But there's going to be an ambush
tomorrow on the North Road.

11
00:01:04,988 --> 00:01:07,920
If you want Henry to make it to
Nottingham, you better change his route.

12
00:01:11,235 --> 00:01:14,480
- Hey, hey, hey! What do you call this?
- Noon tomorrow.

13
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,160
Gold.

14
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:20,762
IF Henry arrives.

15
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,480
He's not coming.

16
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,320
- He's been tipped off.
- By who?

17
00:01:42,388 --> 00:01:44,555
Don't worry, he's probably just late.

18
00:01:44,675 --> 00:01:47,335
Horse needs shoeing or he's
stopped for a kip or something.

19
00:01:47,455 --> 00:01:50,720
He's here to betray the King!
He's hardly going to stop for a nap!

20
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:54,665
- Could Marian have got the time wrong?
- That's a good point actually.

21
00:01:54,785 --> 00:01:58,343
No, cos Marian's trying to listen
at keyholes and stuff, right?

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,382
She could be making
all kinds of mistakes.

23
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:06,917
She could be making a BIG mistake.

24
00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:11,045
Go back to the camp and stay there.

25
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:14,795
- Robin...
- What?

26
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:16,313
That's an order.

27
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,400
Robin...

28
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,040
- My Lord.
- What do you think?

29
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:28,166
Hastings? Portsmouth?

30
00:02:29,392 --> 00:02:31,578
Which south coast port

31
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:35,027
will King Richard make his final,
fateful landing at?

32
00:02:35,147 --> 00:02:38,200
We'll know soon enough.
Henry's here.

33
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:42,044
- As I promised.
- Well done, Gisborne. Well done.

34
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:46,241
Ah, Henry...

35
00:02:50,275 --> 00:02:52,520
Henry of Lewes.

36
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,091
Welcome to my...

37
00:03:01,517 --> 00:03:03,331
Get me my physician!

38
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,081
Get the Sheriff's physician immediately.

39
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:11,601
- Why did you let the messenger through?
- Has he talked?

40
00:03:11,721 --> 00:03:14,051
No, not yet. He was taken ill.

41
00:03:14,587 --> 00:03:17,987
Robin, I took a risk to find out his
route and you still let him through?

42
00:03:18,107 --> 00:03:20,601
- You can't go back into the castle.
- What?

43
00:03:21,276 --> 00:03:23,307
Go to the forest. Now.

44
00:03:23,673 --> 00:03:25,673
I'll Join you when I've silenced Henry.

45
00:03:25,793 --> 00:03:28,313
The forest? Don't be ridiculous!

46
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:30,841
You told me he'd travel
by the North Road.

47
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,939
- Yes.
- And he didn't.

48
00:03:34,578 --> 00:03:38,314
Marian, I think I have
a spy in my gang.

48
00:03:53,700 --> 00:56,800
Sub Wood Team
Moochie & Kiry

49
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:23,142
What are you going to do?

50
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:31,480
I'll silence Henry.

51
00:04:33,495 --> 00:04:37,424
And then I'll find the traitor
in my own camp and silence him.

52
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:41,227
None of your men have been
in the castle. I would have seen them.

53
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,480
Then somebody's going out to meet them.

54
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:46,798
- I'll keep watch.
- No, you'll keep out of it.

55
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:49,169
- No!
- Marian, this is none of your business.

56
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,992
The King's being betrayed right now
because of your spy.

57
00:04:52,112 --> 00:04:54,526
- It IS my business.
- But what if the spy has told them

58
00:04:54,646 --> 00:04:57,120
- about you and the night-watchman?
- Then I'm dead anyway.

59
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:10,357
What are you doing, Blight? He's worse.

60
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,537
- He's calmer.
- Calmer?

61
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,148
- You're calming him to death.
- Medicine is a Journey, my lord.

62
00:05:17,268 --> 00:05:18,760
Not a destination.

63
00:05:18,921 --> 00:05:20,534
Treatments take as long as...

64
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:24,280
Do you seriously think I've got time
for your journey, Blight? A clue!

65
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,733
Gisborne.

66
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,830
You find me a quack who knows
what he's doing.

67
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,508
A quack?

68
00:05:31,628 --> 00:05:35,000
Sheriff, I am a man of learning.
I give you science...

69
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,320
Science? You have given me silence.

70
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,650
I want this man to talk.

71
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,986
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

72
00:05:58,673 --> 00:06:00,022
I know you're angry.

73
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:03,400
You're angry because Henry of Lewes
got past us, but you can't Just run off.

74
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,880
Much, you disobeyed my instructions.
I said wait at the camp.

75
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,120
Gisborne has outwitted us. So what?

76
00:06:12,712 --> 00:06:14,480
His luck will run out. It has to.

77
00:06:15,526 --> 00:06:18,984
Otherwise we'll be asking where
he's getting his information from.

78
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:22,873
What?

79
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:29,304
You think he's getting information?

80
00:06:30,548 --> 00:06:31,897
From one of us?

81
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:33,716
No.

82
00:06:34,392 --> 00:06:38,036
Master, surely some mistake. A traitor?

83
00:06:40,515 --> 00:06:41,501
Who?

84
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:45,215
That's why you've sent us back to camp.

85
00:06:45,507 --> 00:06:47,040
Because you suspect.

86
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:51,844
- You suspect me?
- Much, I have to suspect everyone.

87
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,919
That's me. You suspect me.
Much, go back to the camp!

88
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,640
What do I have to do to prove my
loyalty to you? What? Tell me. What?

89
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,003
I'd chop off my own arms!

90
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:05,348
Well, one arm, because once
I've chopped that off

91
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:07,949
I wouldn't be able
to chop off the other.

92
00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:12,320
If you're true to me,
I ask Just one thing.

93
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:14,800
- You name it.
- Go back to the camp.

94
00:07:25,902 --> 00:07:27,375
Come, come, come.

95
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,800
There you go.

96
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:37,998
This baby's Just like his mother.
Doesn't know up from down.

97
00:07:38,118 --> 00:07:41,921
- Again? Oh, again.
- Don't you bother yourself.

98
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,400
- I'll turn him the right way up.
- How do you know it's a boy?

99
00:07:46,115 --> 00:07:47,666
Because I know.

100
00:07:50,688 --> 00:07:53,199
- But it hurts.
- Hurts?

101
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:54,818
You don't know pain.

102
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:58,476
Try giving birth to him feet-first.
Then you'll know what pain is.

103
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,039
Bring her medicines, everything.

104
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,360
- Sheriff wants your services.
- Get off me! My daughter!

105
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,200
Your daughter can wait.

106
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:08,916
Mother!

107
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:13,639
- Mother!
- You hairy pig-witted fox turd!

108
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,279
I'll pluck your eyeballs

109
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:18,240
from your bony skull
and squelch them into cess pits!

110
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:20,759
- Mother!
- Rosa!

111
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,189
Speak...

112
00:08:22,923 --> 00:08:24,845
Speak, speak, speak.

113
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,640
- Get off me!
- Keep still, woman!

114
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:32,799
Oh, you slimy little snot-head!

115
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:34,919
Matilda...

116
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,903
Blight! Ha!
It's the gravedigger's best friend.

117
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:41,085
The maggot's mate!

118
00:08:41,205 --> 00:08:43,275
Couldn't you find
a civil-tongued wise woman?

119
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:46,376
Apparently she's the one
the civil-tongued wiser men go to.

120
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:48,040
Hello, baldy!

121
00:08:51,035 --> 00:08:52,372
Do you know who I am?

122
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:54,254
I'm the Sheriff.

123
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,927
And I have a job for you.

124
00:08:57,047 --> 00:08:58,639
If you were on fire,

125
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:02,120
I would not damp you
with my wet underwrappings.

126
00:09:04,215 --> 00:09:06,835
Cure this man or you die.

127
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:08,440
Anyone that you love

128
00:09:08,603 --> 00:09:11,549
and even some that you have
a passing liking for.

129
00:09:12,062 --> 00:09:14,599
I can't stay here!
My daughter's expecting a baby.

130
00:09:15,273 --> 00:09:16,439
Your daughter

131
00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:20,064
can expect a corpse for a mother
if you do not do as you are told!

132
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:23,160
Well, I won't stay if she lays
one finger on my patient!

133
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,993
If I treat him, can I go?

134
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:35,126
Do you think I want you
cluttering up my castle?

135
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,624
When he speaks, fetch me. Immediately.

136
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,570
We'll get rid of these things,
for starters.

137
00:09:59,085 --> 00:10:00,920
<i>Sir, there's a sign at the Trip Inn.</i>

138
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,136
Marian.

139
00:10:06,168 --> 00:10:07,596
Where's your guard?

140
00:10:07,716 --> 00:10:10,040
I don't know. I must have lost him.

141
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:14,280
- Watch Lady Marian.
- Is that really necessary?

142
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:19,461
I don't know. Is it?

143
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:21,680
Do you think I'm a threat?

144
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,119
No.

145
00:10:24,655 --> 00:10:27,479
I was wondering if I could
have a day away

146
00:10:27,641 --> 00:10:30,480
from the castle and the guards
and accompany you.

147
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:32,559
- I'm on business.
- Sounds interesting.

148
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:34,080
Marian, it's private.

149
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:36,359
- Sounds doubly interesting.
- Marian.

150
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:38,182
- No.
- Very well.

151
00:10:38,302 --> 00:10:40,720
But at least let me
have a day unchaperoned.

152
00:10:42,735 --> 00:10:45,135
- You're up to something?
- Yes!

153
00:10:45,255 --> 00:10:46,719
I'm charming you

154
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:48,600
so that I can have an hour or two

155
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,920
without a goon on my back!

156
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,584
But you stay in the castle.

157
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:22,288
Did somebody order leeches?

158
00:11:22,408 --> 00:11:25,960
Haven't I seen enough bloodsuckers
for one day? Mostly in charge!

159
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:27,640
Lovely specimens.

160
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,048
Hungry.

161
00:11:34,455 --> 00:11:36,025
Let's take a look.

162
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:55,360
Robin of Locksley.
Mmm, what's that beard?

163
00:11:55,521 --> 00:11:57,679
It's neither grown nor shaven.
Make up your mind.

164
00:11:57,841 --> 00:11:59,124
Hey, Matilda!

165
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,960
- Has this man talked?
- No.

166
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:04,040
You can't treat him.

167
00:12:04,512 --> 00:12:06,920
Good. Get me out of this dung heap.

168
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,400
My Rosa has a baby on the way.

169
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,960
A boy I'd wager,
by the trouble he's caused.

170
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,959
Twice turned himself upside down.

171
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,372
You were worse, I seem to remember.

172
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,840
This will relax her while I turn him.
Come on, let's go.

173
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:22,895
- I have business here first.
- She needs me now.

174
00:12:23,015 --> 00:12:26,680
- Do you know anything about this man?
- Yes, he was stung by a bee. Look.

175
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,279
What, this unwell? From a bee sting?

176
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,818
Well, it can happen.
It nearly killed him.

177
00:12:31,938 --> 00:12:33,575
That and the leeches.

178
00:12:33,695 --> 00:12:35,981
- But he's all right now.
- Wait!

179
00:12:37,655 --> 00:12:39,199
His name is Henry of Lewes.

180
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,400
Now he's come to tell the Sheriff
where the King

181
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:44,639
plans to land when
he returns to England.

182
00:12:44,915 --> 00:12:47,485
- So you should turn away.
- Stop!

183
00:12:47,605 --> 00:12:50,400
Has a dung beetle tunnelled
through your ear and eaten your soul?

184
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,601
I'll be quick.

185
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:53,955
A bee failed to kill him,
a quack failed to kill him,

186
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:55,959
I'll be damned if a boy
I delivered sneaks in

187
00:12:56,121 --> 00:12:58,639
- and finishes off one of my patients.
- Matilda!

188
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,758
I can't let him live
to speak his treason.

189
00:13:02,395 --> 00:13:05,117
So it's not his life you're
afraid of then,

190
00:13:05,237 --> 00:13:06,440
it's his tongue.

191
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:11,508
So? Shall we just
cut out his tongue then?

192
00:13:11,628 --> 00:13:13,399
Oh, men!

193
00:13:13,964 --> 00:13:15,960
Always think in a straight line.

194
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,518
- I've got a better idea.
- Can you silence him?

195
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:21,927
Long enough for you to think of
something better than killing him, yes.

196
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,743
I can muddle his brain for a day or two.

197
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,480
Confuse and baffle him. Now...

198
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,312
Oh, sorry!

199
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:01,449
- Well?
- Hasn't been in yet.

200
00:14:06,635 --> 00:14:08,181
Must be held up.

201
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,640
When he finally arrives,

202
00:14:11,943 --> 00:14:14,873
give him this for delivering Henry.

203
00:14:15,128 --> 00:14:18,399
Tell him it's silver not gold,
because the goods were damaged.

204
00:14:23,122 --> 00:14:24,301
Thank you.

205
00:14:29,991 --> 00:14:31,320
He's waking.

206
00:14:32,142 --> 00:14:34,840
- Matilda, quickly.
- Where am I?

207
00:14:36,315 --> 00:14:39,720
- What is it?
- Here. It's mead.

208
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:46,279
Right, Job done, let's go.

209
00:14:46,441 --> 00:14:48,600
I have to know that it's worked.

210
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,187
Do you want the sun
and the stars as well?

211
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,760
He mustn't talk!

212
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:55,680
If we spare his life
then we sacrifice the King's.

213
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:57,838
<i>Look lively, you pair of oafs!</i>

214
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:04,065
Is he awake?

215
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,634
Henry!

216
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:09,438
Mead! Horrible!

217
00:15:10,115 --> 00:15:12,436
Henry? My dear, Henry!

218
00:15:13,915 --> 00:15:15,076
Castle.

219
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:18,032
Yes, yes, this is Nottingham Castle.

220
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:19,941
I've come from the Holy Land.

221
00:15:20,275 --> 00:15:22,719
- Yes.
- I'll speak only to the Sheriff.

222
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:26,560
Yes, yes. I am the Sheriff.
The Sheriff of Nottingham.

223
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:29,559
- The King...
- Yes, which port will he arrive at?

224
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:31,675
When the King returns
from the Holy Land...

225
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:33,843
Yes, yes, yes, where will he land?

226
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,120
- What's the King's plan?
- He will land...

227
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:41,880
I feel strange. I feel...

228
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,487
Yes, never mind how you feel,

229
00:15:44,607 --> 00:15:46,360
Henry. What's the King's plan?

230
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:48,729
The plan King's.

231
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:51,417
Planking. Port.

232
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:54,557
- Yes, yes, which port?
- Pork.

233
00:15:55,481 --> 00:15:57,640
I have come from the holy pork.

234
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,715
- Which port?
- Pork.

235
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,920
Holy pork.

236
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,259
- There's someone there!
- Guards!

237
00:16:23,175 --> 00:16:24,308
Get this to Rosa.

238
00:16:24,428 --> 00:16:26,632
Get out of here,
you rancid-faced outlaw!

239
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,545
Don't stand on him, you idiots!

240
00:16:28,665 --> 00:16:31,088
Get him up, get him on the bed!

241
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:33,150
Gently, gently, gently.

242
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,265
Which port? Which port?

243
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,188
Robin!

244
00:16:47,815 --> 00:16:48,850
Henry?

245
00:16:49,561 --> 00:16:51,939
He's silenced, but only temporarily.

246
00:16:52,252 --> 00:16:54,485
You're right, you have a spy.

247
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,439
- How do you know?
- I followed Gisborne to the Trip Inn.

248
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,359
Whoever he was meeting didn't come.

249
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:01,879
A serving maid knew him
and he left money with her.

250
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,595
I heard them mention Henry
but I couldn't hear other names.

251
00:17:04,715 --> 00:17:06,880
That's payment for Henry's arrival.

252
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:10,036
Who is it, Marian? Who would betray me?

253
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:14,467
There's Gisborne.

254
00:17:23,355 --> 00:17:24,520
Marian!

255
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:29,880
- Guy.
- You've been following me.

256
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,913
- Me?
- Don't deny it.

257
00:17:32,188 --> 00:17:35,071
- No, I...
- I saw you by the stall earlier.

258
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:36,976
Now here. Coincidence?

259
00:17:37,096 --> 00:17:38,799
- I was only...
- I don't think so.

260
00:17:38,965 --> 00:17:40,800
- You disobeyed me.
- Guy, please.

261
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:42,883
Let me explain.

262
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:45,979
You don't understand. Punish me
but do not punish my father.

263
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,440
Punish you? Why would I punish you?

264
00:17:50,226 --> 00:17:51,680
What have you been doing?

265
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:55,253
Forgive me, you're right.
I disobeyed you.

266
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,935
I Just wanted to spend time with you.

267
00:17:58,854 --> 00:18:01,049
- Really?
- Yes.

268
00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:05,942
Well, I'm honoured, Marian,

269
00:18:06,442 --> 00:18:09,760
but I told you I was on business.

270
00:18:11,393 --> 00:18:13,960
Well, it won't happen again.

271
00:18:15,612 --> 00:18:16,800
Shall we...?

272
00:18:34,535 --> 00:18:36,881
What's your problem? Eh?

273
00:18:37,735 --> 00:18:41,159
- Did you speak to Robin then, or what?
- Why do you want to know?

274
00:18:41,415 --> 00:18:43,782
We want to know what's going on.
What's the plan?

275
00:18:43,902 --> 00:18:45,980
Did the messenger
get through to the castle?

276
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,495
- Is Robin going to kill him?
- Like to know his plans, do you?

277
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:51,800
What's the Sheriff and Gisborne's plan?

278
00:18:52,122 --> 00:18:54,560
- What?
- I mean, is there even a Henry?

279
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:57,039
- Or is it a trap?
- What?

280
00:18:57,295 --> 00:18:59,678
- What's going on?
- How much do they pay you?

281
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:01,040
Pay who?

282
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,146
There's a spy! In the camp.

283
00:19:06,681 --> 00:19:08,000
One of you is a spy

284
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:11,639
and Robin knows. So you're done for.

285
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:12,909
What?

286
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,199
- How does he know?
- It's obvious!

287
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:18,199
Gisborne's always five
or six steps ahead of us.

288
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,383
- Are you calling me a traitor?
Well... Traitor?

289
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,600
- What you looking at me for?
- Well,

290
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,600
you're the one who tried
to persuade me to steal from Robin.

291
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,999
- We thought the King was coming...
- That's right!

292
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:34,319
- We thought about it.
- We decided against it.

293
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:37,073
- I said no!
- Allan. Stop it, now!

294
00:19:37,193 --> 00:19:39,519
Yes. If anyone's going
to kill the traitor,

295
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:42,209
- it's going to be me.
- What makes you so high and mighty?

296
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:45,200
He doesn't trust you either.
Or why has he sent you back here?

297
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,241
- Ah!
- Stop it the pair of you.

298
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:50,221
Off him, stop it!

299
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,464
Robin.

300
00:19:55,521 --> 00:19:56,715
Master!

301
00:19:59,335 --> 00:20:02,578
- What is going on?
- We're taking her to the camp.

302
00:20:02,698 --> 00:20:03,859
What, our camp?

303
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:07,117
- This is Rosa. Matilda's daughter.
- So much for it being a secret.

304
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:09,425
So much for a lot
of things being secret.

305
00:20:10,975 --> 00:20:13,333
Djaq, the baby's the wrong way round.

306
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:15,441
Do you know how to turn it?

307
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,760
- Let's get you to a bed, shall we?
- You don't, do you?

308
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,703
Get on with it!

309
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,800
Your majesty.

310
00:20:40,724 --> 00:20:42,321
He's not the King!

311
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,320
Mother!

312
00:20:45,185 --> 00:20:46,317
His brain!

313
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,318
Bled to dried pig skin by his leeches.

314
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,640
She's poisoned him!

315
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:16,920
Rubbish. I haven't given him anything.

316
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:19,131
I hate to tell tales,

317
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,306
but I've asked around, and rumour has it

318
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:26,213
that she delivered
the baby Robin into this world.

319
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,546
Pig. Canker.

320
00:21:33,075 --> 00:21:35,369
Blight by name, blight by nature.

321
00:21:36,511 --> 00:21:38,679
Help, help!

322
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:40,600
There's someone there.

323
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,211
Oh, nice try.

324
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,416
- You poisoned him, didn't you?
- No.

325
00:21:51,287 --> 00:21:53,572
I Just gave him
something to help him sleep.

326
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:57,036
Well, you can give him something
to wake him up, can't you?

327
00:21:58,606 --> 00:21:59,336
No.

328
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:04,064
There are wrong answers
and there are right answers.

329
00:22:05,048 --> 00:22:06,760
That was a wrong answer.

330
00:22:08,987 --> 00:22:11,120
We need to know who the traitor is.

331
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,360
I'm sorry. It's not the sort
of secret I can keep.

332
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,959
- Let's just deal with Rosa first.
- Tell us, Robin!

333
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,079
Robin, there'll be people like Rosa who
need our help, but if we're not a gang,

334
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:28,240
- if you suspect us...
- All right, it's true.

335
00:22:29,818 --> 00:22:31,560
One of you is betraying us.

336
00:22:32,257 --> 00:22:35,000
You're meeting Gisborne
and you're selling our secrets.

337
00:22:37,918 --> 00:22:40,159
- Not me.
- It's not me either.

338
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,947
- It's not me. Not me. Not me.
- Stop this now.

339
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:46,820
If the guilty man or woman
confesses, right here,

340
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,000
I'll listen.

341
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:52,160
Tell me what Gisborne said,

342
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,280
what he offered.

343
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:56,124
Step forward now.

344
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,240
You have one chance.

345
00:22:59,723 --> 00:23:02,576
I will not be treated
with equal suspicion!

346
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,400
Well, whoever you are...

347
00:23:12,103 --> 00:23:13,920
you've made your choice.

348
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:16,680
And I will find you out.

349
00:23:25,335 --> 00:23:26,576
John...

350
00:23:29,086 --> 00:23:31,520
- Help me turn the baby.
- No.

351
00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:35,686
I have worked in the battlefield.
All men.

352
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:38,880
- I have never treated this before.
- Neither have I.

353
00:23:52,353 --> 00:23:53,160
May I?

354
00:24:07,597 --> 00:24:09,239
- Oh!
- What?

355
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:11,230
It's the head!

356
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,839
Hello, little one.

357
00:24:14,095 --> 00:24:17,079
Hello. The wrong way round.

358
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,412
You need to turn, baby.

359
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,480
- It moved.
- That's it! That's right!

360
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:38,144
How did you do that?

361
00:24:39,315 --> 00:24:41,040
Thank you.

362
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:43,611
Thank you.

363
00:24:49,795 --> 00:24:53,378
My lords, Matilda here somehow managed

364
00:24:53,561 --> 00:24:56,638
to bring a patient of hers
back from the dead.

365
00:24:56,758 --> 00:25:00,298
Certified by my good self - dead.

366
00:25:01,112 --> 00:25:04,864
So, what do we have here?
Do we have a healer?

367
00:25:04,984 --> 00:25:06,236
What's happening?

368
00:25:06,356 --> 00:25:09,377
Or do we have something else?
A necromancer?

369
00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:11,215
A devil worshipper?

370
00:25:12,221 --> 00:25:13,439
A witch?

371
00:25:13,675 --> 00:25:15,445
- She's not a witch!
- So,

372
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,920
perhaps a ducking

373
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,925
in Locksley Pond
would calm all our nerves.

374
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,720
Guy, you know she's not a witch!

375
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:27,559
Marian, say nothing.
These allegations spread by association.

376
00:25:27,795 --> 00:25:30,119
The ducking stool's a death sentence.
You know that.

377
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,161
There's nothing you can do for her.

378
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,360
Did I leave you to die
when you were being drowned?

379
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:38,765
Guy. Guy!

380
00:25:42,515 --> 00:25:45,560
You could avoid this, Matilda.
Tell us the antidote.

381
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:05,053
Boiled Sheriff's brains

382
00:26:05,714 --> 00:26:06,976
with parsley.

383
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,520
To Locksley!

384
00:26:27,068 --> 00:26:28,045
Djaq?

385
00:26:28,861 --> 00:26:30,024
Later.

386
00:26:32,835 --> 00:26:34,121
Are you all right?

387
00:26:34,905 --> 00:26:37,011
There's a spy in the camp,

388
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:38,799
how can anything be all right?

389
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:41,799
Well, he probably knows
he's made a mistake now.

390
00:26:42,073 --> 00:26:44,065
He had his chance to confess.

391
00:26:45,183 --> 00:26:48,280
Maybe he's stuck.
People get stuck, you know?

392
00:26:50,415 --> 00:26:52,199
Your brother said he was stuck.

393
00:26:52,415 --> 00:26:54,949
He refused to change
and he hanged for it.

394
00:26:55,474 --> 00:26:58,399
- He was an idiot.
- No.

395
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,090
He was a good man underneath it.
And you saw that.

396
00:27:04,241 --> 00:27:07,439
And I believe Robin would see it too.

397
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,817
If the spy confessed...

398
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,296
and begged forgiveness

399
00:27:13,949 --> 00:27:15,794
and changed his ways...

400
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:21,639
I believe you're a good man,
Allan A Dale.

401
00:27:27,956 --> 00:27:28,720
Robin!

402
00:27:31,312 --> 00:27:32,600
Robin!

403
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,359
- Robin!
- Matilda!

404
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,480
The Sheriff knows she helped you.

405
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:47,599
She's refusing to tell them how to
wake Henry and they're ducking her.

406
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:49,920
- When?
- Now, at Locksley Pond.

407
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,280
Call your men,
I have to go before I'm missed.

408
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:54,359
Robin! The baby's coming.

409
00:27:55,143 --> 00:27:57,441
- Baby?
- It's Matilda's grandchild.

410
00:27:57,561 --> 00:27:59,759
Robin. Hurry, hurry!

411
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:05,603
Matilda needs us.

412
00:28:05,965 --> 00:28:08,280
Djaq, you stay with Rosa.

413
00:28:08,575 --> 00:28:10,240
Everybody else with me. Now.

414
00:28:10,401 --> 00:28:12,631
- What's happened?
- The Sheriff's happened.

415
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,000
John, can you stay?

416
00:28:32,154 --> 00:28:34,557
Has he said anything sensible yet?

417
00:28:41,317 --> 00:28:44,560
- Lords, ladies, peasants.
- Presents.

418
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:47,159
Pheasants?

419
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:49,412
Have a look at this noble man.

420
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,800
He returned from the dead, possessed!

421
00:28:53,883 --> 00:28:55,920
The witch shall be ducked.

422
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:58,640
If she dies,

423
00:29:00,277 --> 00:29:02,744
it proves the devil
has abandoned her, and she

424
00:29:02,864 --> 00:29:04,935
shall be buried on consecrated ground.

425
00:29:05,055 --> 00:29:06,575
Constipated ground.

426
00:29:08,975 --> 00:29:12,234
If she lives, showing the devil
still to be in her...

427
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,599
she shall be burnt alive!

428
00:29:15,245 --> 00:29:17,280
Hard to know which one to hope for.

429
00:29:18,027 --> 00:29:19,252
Rosa!

430
00:29:19,907 --> 00:29:21,280
My Rosa!

431
00:29:22,316 --> 00:29:23,400
Down she goes.

432
00:29:25,324 --> 00:29:26,489
Deep breath.

433
00:29:39,895 --> 00:29:42,000
Oh, lovely grapes, Gisborne.

434
00:30:04,163 --> 00:30:06,612
You weasel-faced

435
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:08,266
whore's son!

436
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,460
Who, Robin? No, Robin's not here!

437
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:16,704
And three, two, one!

438
00:30:19,291 --> 00:30:21,461
Deep breath, deep breath.

439
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,600
There's something...

440
00:30:34,786 --> 00:30:37,233
- What's happening?
- It's fine.

441
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,000
Your husband, is he away?

442
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:43,880
- The wars.
- He'd be so proud of you.

443
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,919
What's your wife's name?

444
00:30:48,081 --> 00:30:48,938
Alice.

445
00:30:49,521 --> 00:30:53,286
So you've done this before, with Alice?

446
00:30:53,824 --> 00:30:55,519
- No.
- Why is it so hard?

447
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,969
No, I was an outlaw in the forest.

448
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,080
Alice was alone.

449
00:31:05,734 --> 00:31:06,880
Push now.

450
00:31:14,435 --> 00:31:16,335
# Pom, pom, pom. #

451
00:31:58,881 --> 00:32:00,279
I curse you!

452
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:01,997
May snakes

453
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:05,010
crawl up your nose holes

454
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,959
and feed on your tiny brain!

455
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:11,157
Down, down!

456
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:33,000
Breathe slowly.

457
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,240
It's going to be difficult
to take him. Henry.

458
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,915
Can't we just kill him?

459
00:32:45,035 --> 00:32:48,158
No, draw attention to Robin,
won't we? Put him in danger.

460
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:50,400
We bide our time, wait
until they're distracted.

461
00:32:51,751 --> 00:32:54,190
Unless one of you two's
informed Gisborne.

462
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:57,344
- Keep your accusations to yourself!
- You keep pumping!

463
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,834
Let's lift up the carcass.

464
00:33:03,234 --> 00:33:05,127
Ten, nine,

465
00:33:05,742 --> 00:33:08,163
eight, seven,

466
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:11,152
six, five,

467
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,447
four, three,

468
00:33:14,663 --> 00:33:17,135
two... and a half,

469
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:19,703
one... and a half,

470
00:33:20,185 --> 00:33:21,840
and bring up!

471
00:33:38,715 --> 00:33:40,985
What the devil is that, Blight?

472
00:33:42,055 --> 00:33:45,200
I suspect they may be
her underwrappings, my Lord.

473
00:33:45,473 --> 00:33:48,080
Shut up! Shut up!

474
00:33:50,517 --> 00:33:51,953
Arrest, arrest!

475
00:33:52,624 --> 00:33:55,909
Gisborne! Henry's gone,
Gisborne! Henry's gone.

476
00:33:56,029 --> 00:33:58,640
Guards, find him!

477
00:34:12,064 --> 00:34:14,555
Rosa, where's my Rosa?

478
00:34:16,837 --> 00:34:17,902
Rosa?

479
00:34:20,004 --> 00:34:21,000
Mother?

480
00:34:21,647 --> 00:34:23,257
Where's the little lad?

481
00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:25,920
- Tell me the lad's all right.
- No lad.

482
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:27,779
No lad?

482
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,660
She's a girl !

483
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:37,992
Good lungs, she has.

484
00:34:38,898 --> 00:34:40,519
Not a moment's peace!

485
00:34:40,795 --> 00:34:44,408
Well, let's see if her damp
grandmother can't set her off again.

486
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,511
Hey, my little...

487
00:34:50,562 --> 00:34:51,720
What's her name?

488
00:34:52,334 --> 00:34:53,278
Alice.

489
00:34:53,555 --> 00:34:55,720
I'm going to call her Alice.

490
00:34:56,036 --> 00:34:57,096
Alice.

491
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,240
Still in the land of fairies.

492
00:35:10,957 --> 00:35:12,961
What are you going to do with him?

493
00:35:13,081 --> 00:35:15,639
- I'll banish him.
- We should kill him.

494
00:35:16,085 --> 00:35:18,854
A traitor to the King
doesn't deserve to live.

495
00:35:24,315 --> 00:35:26,680
Oi, Much. Look!

496
00:35:27,462 --> 00:35:29,280
Much, meet Alice!

497
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,600
- Put him down, Henry!
- They say you don't kill any more.

498
00:35:43,176 --> 00:35:45,519
- For the King, I kill.
- The King's finished.

499
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,975
The Sheriff, Prince John and
the Black Knights, they'll win.

500
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:51,551
Robin...

501
00:36:06,515 --> 00:36:08,200
Not today, they won't.

502
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,800
Can I trust you, Will?

503
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,080
Of course.

504
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,687
- I need your help.
- Anything.

505
00:36:25,807 --> 00:36:29,064
Marian saw a serving maid
speaking to Gisborne. At the Trip.

506
00:36:29,184 --> 00:36:30,919
She'll know who our spy is.

507
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,600
I can go to the Trip,

508
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,360
find the maid and make her
tell me who the traitor is.

509
00:36:35,658 --> 00:36:38,440
- You go back to the camp at sundown.
- Where am I going?

510
00:36:40,155 --> 00:36:41,568
This is gonna hurt.

511
00:36:46,326 --> 00:36:47,439
What's he doing?

512
00:36:49,115 --> 00:36:50,919
- Robin!
- Master!

513
00:36:51,721 --> 00:36:53,240
Sundown, remember?

514
00:37:00,915 --> 00:37:02,239
I knew it was him.

515
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,712
I knew it was him.

516
00:37:03,832 --> 00:37:05,774
- Will?
- No!

517
00:37:06,214 --> 00:37:07,919
I knew it!

518
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:10,399
Robin... Will's the spy.

519
00:37:11,323 --> 00:37:13,594
- This subject's closed.
- Will,

520
00:37:13,761 --> 00:37:15,359
Robin, I do not believe!

521
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:17,845
- I need to speak with you.
- Not now.

522
00:37:17,965 --> 00:37:20,160
- Believe me Robin, I need...
- No you don't, Djaq!

523
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,219
Trust me!

524
00:37:22,928 --> 00:37:25,679
Will's gone. And that's the end of it.

525
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:28,299
I have to go to the castle.
I think he had a go-between.

526
00:37:28,419 --> 00:37:30,199
- At the castle?
- Yes, at the Trip.

527
00:37:30,455 --> 00:37:33,639
Marian saw a serving girl
receiving money from Gisborne.

528
00:37:33,915 --> 00:37:36,694
I have to meet Marian to find out
exactly what Gisborne knows...

529
00:37:36,814 --> 00:37:38,160
- We'll come.
- No, no.

530
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,074
I'm safer on my own.

531
00:37:40,194 --> 00:37:41,919
Meanwhile, you lot have to scatter,

532
00:37:42,195 --> 00:37:44,559
until I find out whether Gisborne
knows about the camp.

533
00:37:45,131 --> 00:37:46,996
I'll go to the Trip at sundown.

534
00:37:47,304 --> 00:37:49,135
Come back here after that.

535
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:51,216
I'll tell you what I know.

536
00:37:54,415 --> 00:37:56,000
What are we going to do?

537
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,539
You heard him. We scatter.

538
00:38:03,455 --> 00:38:04,707
You're late.

539
00:38:05,127 --> 00:38:07,282
I was going to keep your money back.

540
00:38:09,837 --> 00:38:10,766
Silver.

541
00:38:11,793 --> 00:38:12,824
Not gold.

542
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,799
You're going to tell Gisborne
to keep this money.

543
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,231
I'm not doing this any more, right?
I've changed.

544
00:38:18,351 --> 00:38:20,359
It's a bit late for
a conscience, isn't it?

545
00:38:20,683 --> 00:38:22,240
Yeah. Very late.

546
00:38:27,693 --> 00:38:28,600
Robin...

547
00:38:41,466 --> 00:38:42,671
You're early.

548
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,920
Leave us.

549
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:45,600
- Stay there.
- Get out!

550
00:38:52,835 --> 00:38:54,185
I need to talk...

551
00:38:55,191 --> 00:38:56,316
to my spy.

552
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,944
What was that with Will?

553
00:39:02,354 --> 00:39:04,520
- You banished Will.
- It was an act!

554
00:39:05,549 --> 00:39:07,553
Only she knew who was guilty.

555
00:39:08,803 --> 00:39:12,208
And I knew the spy would want to come
here before me to cover his tracks.

556
00:39:12,328 --> 00:39:14,880
For all I knew, it could
have been Will standing there.

557
00:39:16,635 --> 00:39:17,763
But it's not,

558
00:39:18,298 --> 00:39:19,183
is it?

559
00:39:22,106 --> 00:39:23,120
It's you.

560
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,483
Robin,

561
00:39:25,118 --> 00:39:27,253
it was over. You ask her.

562
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,799
- I made a decision.
- Then what's this?

563
00:39:29,962 --> 00:39:31,400
I was giving it back!

564
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,239
So you betray me.

565
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:38,199
You betray yourself,
you betray your King.

566
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:39,699
For what?

567
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:42,595
For a few silver coins?

568
00:39:43,455 --> 00:39:45,520
What have you told Gisborne, Allan?

569
00:39:48,893 --> 00:39:50,364
Nothing really.

570
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,962
- Does he know about the camp?
- No!

571
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,879
Does he know about Marian?

572
00:39:57,403 --> 00:39:58,132
No!

573
00:40:00,801 --> 00:40:02,382
- More lies?
- No!

574
00:40:04,847 --> 00:40:06,879
This was the last time, I promise.

575
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,365
And I was wrong.

576
00:40:09,245 --> 00:40:11,999
But he captured me, Robin.
He tortured me, I had no choice.

577
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:13,560
Everything is a choice!

578
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,439
Everything we do.

579
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,920
That's easy for you
to say though, isn't it?

580
00:40:26,156 --> 00:40:27,685
You get the glory,

581
00:40:28,096 --> 00:40:30,494
you get the girl. Everyone loves you.

582
00:40:30,764 --> 00:40:33,719
Then when the King comes back,
you'll have land, property, a wife.

583
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:36,454
Everything. What will I have?

584
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,276
You're always in the sun, Robin.

585
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,812
And I'm always in the shade.

586
00:40:45,156 --> 00:40:46,986
Is that meant to be an excuse?

587
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:51,751
Give me another chance, please.

588
00:40:52,761 --> 00:40:56,410
I wouldn't let Gisborne hurt any of us.
I've never told him anything like that.

589
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,710
Harmless lies? Innocent betrayals?

590
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,720
They don't exist, Allan.

591
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:03,440
Robin, I've changed.

592
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,914
How can I get you to believe that?

593
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:08,640
You can't.

594
00:41:10,539 --> 00:41:12,080
And the funny thing is...

595
00:41:13,444 --> 00:41:15,865
- you might be telling the truth.
- I am!

596
00:41:16,556 --> 00:41:18,840
How am I supposed
to believe you any more?

597
00:41:19,329 --> 00:41:22,960
Robin, I swear to you on my life!

598
00:41:28,115 --> 00:41:29,391
Don't kill me.

599
00:41:30,297 --> 00:41:31,235
Please.

600
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:43,000
You're lucky I've left you
with a life to swear upon.

601
00:41:46,705 --> 00:41:49,983
Never, never let me
set eyes on you again.

602
00:42:04,534 --> 00:42:05,727
Are we safe?

603
00:42:09,155 --> 00:42:09,896
Will!

604
00:42:12,253 --> 00:42:14,037
- Will?
- It's all right.

605
00:42:14,527 --> 00:42:16,708
It's all right. It wasn't him.

606
00:42:17,963 --> 00:42:18,730
What?

607
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:23,083
It was a trap.

608
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,518
I lied to you, I'm sorry.

609
00:42:26,538 --> 00:42:28,252
I had to lure the spy.

610
00:42:32,184 --> 00:42:33,520
It was Allan.

611
00:42:34,143 --> 00:42:35,240
Is he alive?

612
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:38,308
- Where?
- He's gone.

613
00:42:38,566 --> 00:42:40,628
Allan, why?

614
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:42,759
For money, John. Why else?

615
00:42:43,242 --> 00:42:45,246
I believe he could have changed.

616
00:42:46,141 --> 00:42:48,608
- You knew it was him?
- I didn't know. I guessed.

617
00:42:50,238 --> 00:42:51,566
I knew it was him.

618
00:42:51,848 --> 00:42:53,331
I knew it was Allan.

619
00:42:56,163 --> 00:42:57,622
Will, you forgive me?

620
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,720
- It worked.
- And the rest of you?

621
00:43:06,014 --> 00:43:07,680
Travellers on the North Road.

622
00:43:09,425 --> 00:43:10,200
Right.

623
00:43:11,447 --> 00:43:12,800
Are you with me?

624
00:43:14,081 --> 00:43:16,560
Yeah? Well then, let's go.

625
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,062
- What are we celebrating?
- The signing of an important document.

626
00:43:26,182 --> 00:43:27,519
This is a Traitor's Charter.

627
00:43:27,681 --> 00:43:30,310
The Sheriff is making the Black
Knights sign their allegiance.

628
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:32,840
If you love peace, do not sign.

629
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:35,080
- It'll cost you Sussex.
- I have lost Sussex!

630
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:36,360
I am Sir Guy's man.

631
00:43:38,081 --> 00:43:41,087
- Traitor!
- Marian? She's not here.

632
00:43:41,207 --> 00:43:44,320
- Winchester wants you.
- I need to give this note to Marian.
