SHERWOOD FOREST

00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,836
Robin Hood!

3
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:06,822
This way!

4
00:00:08,712 --> 00:00:10,863
Come on!

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,273
Take cover.

6
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:18,517
Robin, the Sheriff's in range.

7
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:22,557
It's the perfect shot. One arrow,
it's the end of the reign of terror.

8
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:25,429
For your crimes against the
people of Nottingham, Sheriff.

9
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:29,761
You're rubbish, Daniel. It's my turn
with the bow.

10
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:31,997
- I'm Robin!
- You're always Robin!

11
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:34,247
I get this boring piece of tree.

12
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:36,474
Hey!

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,866
Mark, get up.

14
00:01:14,796 --> 00:01:15,670
Now!

15
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:22,933
You see?

16
00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:26,947
I told you I could do it!
Nothing can penetrate it.

17
00:01:27,047 --> 00:01:30,217
- Excellent work.
- What else did you expect?

18
00:01:30,317 --> 00:01:31,920
Unfortunately...

19
00:01:32,577 --> 00:01:35,001
this secret cannot leave the forest.

20
00:01:40,037 --> 00:01:41,190
Get them!

EPISODE 3
CHILDHOOD

27
00:02:35,317 --> 00:02:37,657
Go round, go round!

28
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,629
Mark, come on!

29
00:03:22,524 --> 00:03:24,209
Come on out.

30
00:03:26,057 --> 00:03:29,686
You can trust me.
I'm Lord of Locksley.

31
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:57,319
Lord of Locksley...

32
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,317
- Let go of me!
- It's all right.

33
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,330
Hang on, I know you.

34
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,333
You're Marian's 
stableboy at Knighton Hall!

35
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:04,896
How do you know that?

36
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:07,661
What happened?

37
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,513
I know Gisborne's up to something,
cause I've been tracking him.

38
00:04:11,488 --> 00:04:13,340
- I don't trust you.
- All right.

39
00:04:14,697 --> 00:04:17,469
- Tell me your name.
- Daniel.

40
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:20,482
- Daniel, do you know who I am?
- No.

41
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:22,976
I'm Robin Hood.

42
00:04:34,777 --> 00:04:37,037
So what were you doing up there?

43
00:04:37,137 --> 00:04:39,222
Nothing! Playing.

44
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:43,753
- Playing Robin Hood.
- What, playing a loser?

45
00:04:43,873 --> 00:04:45,798
We didn't see anything, sir.

46
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,657
If you didn't see anything?

47
00:04:50,777 --> 00:04:52,916
Why would you say 
you didn't see anything?

48
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:54,710
We won't say a thing, sir.

49
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:58,299
You can be sure of that.

50
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:02,979
Wait!

51
00:05:04,777 --> 00:05:07,970
We can use them. 
Send them to the mine.

52
00:05:08,337 --> 00:05:12,710
And send word to the Sheriff.
Success...finally.

53
00:05:17,257 --> 00:05:20,099
Gisborne's got my friends.
He's got my friends!

54
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:23,943
I can help you with your friends,
but I need you to tell me what you saw.

55
00:05:25,177 --> 00:05:28,625
A man. They shot him,
but he didn't die.

56
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,885
The arrows bounced off.

57
00:05:31,117 --> 00:05:33,225
And then Sir Guy 
killed him with a knife.

58
00:05:33,345 --> 00:05:35,266
And now he's going to kill my friends.

59
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:39,066
The arrows bounced off what?

60
00:05:39,186 --> 00:05:42,677
Armour. He was
wearing armour - funny armour.

61
00:05:43,486 --> 00:05:46,610
Let's see about your friends,
shall we? Come on.

62
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:50,854
- Thank you.
- I thought you said "chicken"?

63
00:05:51,793 --> 00:05:53,944
This is a pretty
small chicken, Much.

64
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:55,503
Yeah. Again.

65
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:59,990
And have you seen in the trees?
No squirrels lately!

66
00:06:02,217 --> 00:06:03,690
It's not squirrel.

67
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,790
And what happened 
to the vegetables,

68
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,397
All you eat is bread and meat.

69
00:06:10,497 --> 00:06:13,884
We are surrounded by
edible berries and leaves.

70
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,006
- Where's the fruit, the salad?
- Salad?!

71
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,974
Men eating leaves?

72
00:06:19,094 --> 00:06:21,217
There's only one use 
for leaves around here.

73
00:06:21,317 --> 00:06:23,814
And you wouldn't want to
be eating them afterwards!

74
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:25,025
Up!

75
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:29,317
We need to go. This is Daniel.
His friends are in danger.

76
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:31,477
And if I'm not much
mistaken, so are we.

77
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:33,477
- What's up?
- It's Gisborne.

78
00:06:33,577 --> 00:06:35,451
He's creating
a new armour.

79
00:06:35,697 --> 00:06:38,484
We need to take his toys away,
so arm yourselves.

80
00:06:40,128 --> 00:06:41,171
Little John!

81
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,260
Will! Allan A Dale!

82
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,153
And you must be
Djaq, the Saracen. Wow!

83
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,253
Sorry. Who are you?

84
00:06:51,532 --> 00:06:52,509
That...

85
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:56,725
- That's Much.
- Oh, yes! The servant.

86
00:07:01,198 --> 00:07:02,607
Very funny.

87
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,550
- What?
- Nothing.

88
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:16,537
It's just... 
I thought you'd be... taller.

89
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:19,197
I'm quite tall.

90
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:21,909
But you know, like a giant.

91
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,652
Men tend to lie about their size.

92
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:27,435
You ready? Give me that.

93
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:31,461
You won't be needing it.
Come on. Let's go.

94
00:07:39,096 --> 00:07:40,176
They've gone.

95
00:07:55,177 --> 00:07:56,305
It's Mark's.

96
00:07:57,164 --> 00:07:58,450
See the M?

97
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:03,775
- That's good.
- We play outlaws.

98
00:08:04,957 --> 00:08:06,218
I'm Robin Hood.

99
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,997
Well, I hope you're better at playing
Robin Hood than I am.

100
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:10,184
No.

101
00:08:11,717 --> 00:08:16,230
I let go of his hand. Gisborne's
lot were coming, and I just ran.

102
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,977
- Then you did the right thing.
- Really?

103
00:08:19,486 --> 00:08:23,702
If you hadn't run, you would have
been caught too. What good is that?

104
00:08:24,717 --> 00:08:28,351
Listen...sometimes,
in the heat of battle,

105
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:32,340
there isn't time
to watch your gang's back.

106
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:34,990
Wagon tracks.

107
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,067
They've gone to
Locksley, all right?

108
00:08:39,717 --> 00:08:40,982
Come on. Let's go.

109
00:09:10,228 --> 00:09:12,684
Let's see it, then. The magic metal.

110
00:09:26,037 --> 00:09:26,934
Is this it?

111
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,576
- Indeed.
- Very thin.

112
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:32,159
Thin... yes.

113
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:37,297
But that is its beauty. With this
on, a soldier can dance in battle.

114
00:09:37,397 --> 00:09:40,513
- Yes. How does it work?
- That is my secret,

115
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,180
and I am the only man west of
Jerusalem who knows how to make it.

116
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,902
Ooh, lah-de-dah!

117
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:50,695
O ye of little faith.

118
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:53,805
Come, I will show 
you a little of my art.

119
00:09:57,454 --> 00:10:00,102
Stinks like a Turk's trousers.

120
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,605
To the artist, it is a beautiful smell.
Here, my special ingredient.

121
00:10:06,658 --> 00:10:09,392
This, to me, is more
precious than diamonds.

122
00:10:09,512 --> 00:10:13,569
- I hope so. More expensive than diamonds.
- Watch!

123
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,757
Don't cough. Inbreathe, inhale!

124
00:10:29,857 --> 00:10:31,681
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy?!

125
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:40,135
Water for the Sheriff.

126
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,242
Believe me, in time,
you will grow used to it.

127
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,412
You will get used
to it, my friend.

128
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:50,795
Start production. I want
5000 suits of armour.

129
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:53,437
My lord, that is a very great
undertaking.

130
00:10:53,537 --> 00:10:57,701
- Yes. Your fee is very generous.
- The King of France would pay double.

131
00:11:04,617 --> 00:11:06,460
You are indeed an artist.

132
00:11:09,777 --> 00:11:10,667
Double?

133
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:14,670
An inconvenience. But think of the gain.

134
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,371
An army of indestructible warriors.

135
00:11:18,297 --> 00:11:19,887
Put this safely in my room.

136
00:11:26,337 --> 00:11:27,682
Gisborne...

137
00:11:28,662 --> 00:11:30,596
have you started a family,

138
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:33,877
- without telling me?
- My lord...

139
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,848
Children.

140
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,790
I caught them snooping around
in the woods, my lord.

141
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:49,207
Tell me they didn't see you
testing the armour in the forest.

142
00:11:53,436 --> 00:11:55,066
Why didn't you kill them?

143
00:11:55,186 --> 00:11:58,422
My lord, I decided we could use them in 
the mines. We need extra labour so...

144
00:11:58,542 --> 00:11:59,103
You see, 

145
00:11:59,223 --> 00:12:02,541
just when I thought I could let you out 
by yourself, to flap your little wings,

146
00:12:02,661 --> 00:12:04,300
you go and show compassion!

147
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:09,317
When there are people who know
our little secret,

148
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,935
those people have to die.

149
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,643
- It's the back door plan!
- Come on. We move.

150
00:12:46,763 --> 00:12:48,417
Every time!

151
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:15,973
Round here.

152
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:20,508
Wait.

153
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:33,349
I don't like waiting.

154
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:36,215
Especially behind a cow.

155
00:13:37,426 --> 00:13:40,121
- It's not good for my constitution.
- Much! Shhh.

156
00:14:16,783 --> 00:14:19,421
- Hood? !
- It's Locksley, to you.

157
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:24,984
No.

158
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,286
Locksley's mine now.

159
00:14:29,971 --> 00:14:32,398
This Locksley will never be yours!

160
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:48,911
Still sore?

161
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:52,520
Face facts, Hood!  you lost, I won!

162
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,470
Will... I need Allan and Djaq now! Go!

163
00:15:12,904 --> 00:15:14,716
You want hearts and minds.

164
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:19,377
But you'll never have them.
No matter how many people you kill.

165
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,593
No matter how many 
children you terrify.

166
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,990
No matter how much armour you put on.

167
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,276
You overestimate me, Hood.

168
00:15:33,396 --> 00:15:36,844
You know that sometimes at night, I get
one of your servants to rub my feet.

169
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,420
I don't care if she has a heart
or a mind!

170
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,906
Right. Step over there,
cover your eyes. I'll be back.

171
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:45,281
Ok?

172
00:15:54,994 --> 00:15:59,243
Ah...rescued by outlaws.
Quelle surprise!

173
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,822
We fight. Take this.
Defend me from above.

174
00:16:03,707 --> 00:16:05,014
Well, this should be fun.

175
00:16:07,084 --> 00:16:10,032
Come on! Where's
Mark? You've left Mark!

176
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:12,642
He's all right. We need you. Now.

177
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:17,001
- You lot, stay here.
- In. Go in.

178
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,382
I'm afraid I can't let you
keep these diamonds, Gisborne.

179
00:16:25,502 --> 00:16:27,293
And I can't let you take them.

180
00:16:27,563 --> 00:16:29,925
The Black Knights would be VERY
disappointed.

181
00:16:30,045 --> 00:16:31,703
Then it's a stalemate.

182
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:37,418
- Shall we toss a coin for it?
- Not stalemate. Checkmate!

183
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,407
I'll see you!

184
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,503
Ah! Son of a camel!

185
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:56,583
Hood!

186
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:06,507
In the heat of the battle, there is
time to watch your gang's back.

187
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:08,404
Thanks, Dan. Go! Go!

188
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:35,591
This way!

189
00:17:38,436 --> 00:17:39,516
This is for the poor!

190
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,451
Got you!

191
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:08,551
Come on! Get in. Get in.

192
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:15,852
- Is everyone all right?
- No, wait.

193
00:18:16,237 --> 00:18:17,630
Where's Daniel?

194
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:21,934
Gisborne! Robin Hood just knocked
one of my men out with a wooden box.

195
00:18:22,054 --> 00:18:25,451
Now, you tell me it was not the
box with the black diamonds in it!

196
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:31,269
Five men and a boy!

197
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,616
Hostage!

198
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,783
Daniel!

199
00:18:38,455 --> 00:18:40,979
Robin Hood'll be back. 
He'll rescue me.

200
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:42,634
We're counting on it.

201
00:18:43,197 --> 00:18:46,430
People of Locksley!
Let Robin Hood know this.

202
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,310
We want our box and its
contents back by morning.

203
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:54,037
Or his little friend...
will be punished.

204
00:18:55,131 --> 00:18:58,126
His little friend will die.

205
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:06,585
Robin, we get the boy... now.

206
00:19:06,705 --> 00:19:09,173
No. We stop and we think, John.

207
00:19:09,293 --> 00:19:11,171
You've got to give
him what he wants.

208
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:17,365
Robin, take a look at this metal.

209
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:20,432
It is Damascus steel,
or something like it.

210
00:19:20,552 --> 00:19:22,858
A man wearing this 
would be invincible.

211
00:19:22,978 --> 00:19:25,099
Western weapons would
 be useless against this.

212
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:26,676
We can't let the 
Sheriff make this stuff.

213
00:19:26,796 --> 00:19:28,617
That's why I took the stones.

214
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:32,430
- We cannot give them back, Robin.
- I know.

215
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,302
- But we can't let the boy die.
- What do we do?

216
00:19:48,198 --> 00:19:49,306
Thank you.

217
00:20:17,037 --> 00:20:19,399
My guard has gone for bread.
We have two minutes.

218
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,140
I heard about the boy.
What do you want?

219
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,647
The Sheriff and Gisborne are 
developing a new armour.

220
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:27,305
It'll make him and the Black Knights
invincible. We have to stop them.

221
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:29,682
- We can't risk the boy.
- I know.

222
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,072
But if the Sheriff defeats the king
then how many more lives will be lost?

223
00:20:33,344 --> 00:20:36,112
My guard! I will get the boy out
tonight.

224
00:20:36,232 --> 00:20:38,311
- How? You're under house arrest.
- I will find a way.

225
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:40,293
That's the whole point 
to me being here.

226
00:20:46,762 --> 00:20:48,142
Here, take this.

227
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,293
So, if Marian succeeds,
we don't have to do any of this?

228
00:20:51,413 --> 00:20:53,015
But if she doesn't, we need a plan.

229
00:20:53,278 --> 00:20:54,317
Right...

230
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,877
we need to trade Daniel and
the black diamonds in open space.

231
00:20:58,562 --> 00:21:00,797
And that's here. So when
the Sheriff has the diamonds

232
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:02,881
and we have Daniel back safely,

233
00:21:03,373 --> 00:21:04,413
then we can strike.

234
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:06,813
We can't just nick them back, though.

235
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,566
He'll have the place surrounded,
won't he?

236
00:21:08,686 --> 00:21:11,426
May as well just walk in, hands in
the air, saying, "Shoot me."

237
00:21:11,546 --> 00:21:13,741
- We could destroy them.
- We'll have to.

238
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,097
We need something that burns quickly.

239
00:21:16,197 --> 00:21:17,950
- Pitch.
-  What about straw?

240
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,715
Straw is fast, 
but it's not hot enough.

241
00:21:19,835 --> 00:21:20,448
Pitch.

242
00:21:20,568 --> 00:21:23,170
- Wood?
- Wood's hot, but it's not quick enough.

243
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:27,323
Pitch. Fast-burning and hot.

244
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,982
Pitch! Good thinking, Mark.

245
00:21:32,102 --> 00:21:35,550
I could make a new box. Choose
the right wood. Something thin.

246
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,926
Could line it with pitch.

247
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,975
We'd carry the black diamonds
in that to the Sheriff,

248
00:21:39,095 --> 00:21:40,970
and you could shoot it, Robin.
A flaming arrow.

249
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,889
And the rocks will explode.

250
00:21:43,456 --> 00:21:45,953
Good idea, Will. We'll test it
in the morning.

251
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:48,855
Much... Is this rat?

252
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,825
- It's chicken.
- I can't see any feathers.

253
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,243
No? We haven't seen any squirrels!

254
00:21:59,163 --> 00:21:59,798
Right.

255
00:22:00,656 --> 00:22:02,780
I don't suppose anyone round here
has actually noticed,

256
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,232
but I have to do everything
you all have to do, AND...

257
00:22:05,352 --> 00:22:07,020
keep this larder stocked.

258
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,817
So if anyone else would care of
run themselves, ragged in the forest,

259
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:14,587
trying to catch us some massive animal,
then you can be the servants!

260
00:22:38,384 --> 00:22:39,389
My lord.

261
00:22:43,858 --> 00:22:45,817
My lord, I beg a favour of you.

262
00:22:46,722 --> 00:22:49,034
I have prepared a pass for you to sign.

263
00:22:49,154 --> 00:22:51,441
And I need your permission
to leave the castle.

264
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:56,592
- Why?
- You so decreed it.

265
00:22:56,817 --> 00:22:58,332
No, no.

266
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,630
I mean, why do
you need to leave?

267
00:23:03,778 --> 00:23:05,074
To visit Guy.

268
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,318
Gisborne?

269
00:23:10,017 --> 00:23:13,754
Well...he's had a bad day.
I don't advise it.

270
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:18,790
He should have killed...
some little boys.

271
00:23:23,062 --> 00:23:25,257
And now it's a mess.

272
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:37,189
Well, then, perhaps now is a good
time for me, to offer him an apology.

273
00:23:42,074 --> 00:23:43,858
At this hour?

274
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:50,393
And in your finest silks.

275
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,255
I hope to make
my peace with him.

276
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:05,749
Please.

277
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:12,419
Well... missy.

278
00:24:17,425 --> 00:24:18,843
If it were me...

279
00:24:22,812 --> 00:24:26,171
...I would slap your fickle face.

280
00:24:33,397 --> 00:24:35,661
Both of them.

281
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,110
This is a pass for the castle gate.

282
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,337
But underneath is an order to send
Daniel back to the castle,

283
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:54,155
so the Sheriff can 
question him tonight.

284
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:57,570
Gisborne won't release him to us.
But he will release him to...

285
00:24:58,275 --> 00:24:59,533
a castle guard.

286
00:25:03,105 --> 00:25:03,950
I'll do it.

287
00:25:08,663 --> 00:25:10,239
Are you aware of the risk?

288
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,348
- If Guy catches you...
- Don't worry.

289
00:25:12,468 --> 00:25:16,470
- He'll be putty in my hands.
- You're a brave man.

290
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:17,729
Well...

291
00:25:21,923 --> 00:25:23,018
I'll go ahead.

292
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:25,989
I told the Sheriff I'd call on Gisborne,
so I must show my face there.

293
00:25:27,154 --> 00:25:28,139
Good luck.

294
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,087
Forgive me.

295
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:54,350
Marian, it's late.

296
00:25:55,026 --> 00:25:56,203
Why so urgent?

297
00:25:56,786 --> 00:25:59,837
I wish to speak to you...
about a personal matter.

298
00:26:03,537 --> 00:26:05,255
I'll send for you.

299
00:26:15,357 --> 00:26:17,004
Yeah. What is it?

300
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,750
There is bad blood between us.

301
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:23,300
You overestimate yourself

302
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,657
I had feelings for you.

303
00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:29,441
I made no bones about that.

304
00:26:30,145 --> 00:26:31,093
But now...

305
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,230
I feel nothing.

306
00:26:37,316 --> 00:26:41,467
And I have larger
concerns... ambitions.

307
00:26:42,105 --> 00:26:44,777
Is there no hope of a reconciliation?

308
00:26:45,143 --> 00:26:48,357
I know you are a man
capable of compassion.

309
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,068
I offer...

310
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,710
I offer friendship.

311
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:06,070
Guy...

312
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,790
- What?
- I don't know.

313
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:16,981
Marian, what is this all about?

314
00:27:17,526 --> 00:27:20,521
- It's about friendship, that's all.
- No.

315
00:27:22,957 --> 00:27:24,750
This isn't about friendship.

316
00:27:25,793 --> 00:27:27,397
You want your freedom back.

317
00:27:28,337 --> 00:27:31,703
That's what this is all about.
And I can't give that to you.

318
00:27:33,898 --> 00:27:36,246
You and your father, you've made
your own bed.

319
00:27:39,795 --> 00:27:43,006
Sorry, master. There's a messenger
from the Sheriff.

320
00:27:43,126 --> 00:27:44,164
I should go.

321
00:27:53,931 --> 00:27:55,471
That looked friendly.

322
00:27:56,113 --> 00:27:58,390
- You were spying on me?!
- I was not spying on you!

323
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,468
- I was making sure you were safe.
- I was safe.

324
00:28:00,588 --> 00:28:03,445
Shouldn't you be making sure
Allan is safe?

325
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:06,515
I've played my part.

326
00:28:08,093 --> 00:28:09,041
Marian...

327
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,453
This is the Sheriff's official seal.
Who gave you this?

328
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,042
Listen, mate...

329
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:24,784
the fact you're standing there, holding
that, means I've stopped Robin, right?

330
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,837
I don't know where it's from.

331
00:28:27,932 --> 00:28:30,782
You know, I start asking too many
questions, they're gonna blow my cover.

332
00:28:33,006 --> 00:28:35,682
- You did well to bring this to me.
- Yeah!

333
00:28:38,045 --> 00:28:40,918
I know. I think I'll
have a bit more wine.

334
00:28:48,285 --> 00:28:51,562
So... your plan's failed.

335
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,517
What will Robin do?

336
00:28:55,293 --> 00:28:58,692
Well, if this doesn't work,
it's a straightforward swap.

337
00:28:59,058 --> 00:29:03,538
Diamonds for boy. Robin wouldn't risk
the boy's life, not for anything.

338
00:29:04,664 --> 00:29:06,557
How very noble of him.

339
00:29:07,641 --> 00:29:09,153
But there must be some trick.

340
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,224
What's it worth?

341
00:29:23,623 --> 00:29:24,624
Pitch,

342
00:29:25,755 --> 00:29:27,924
in a box containing the diamonds.

343
00:29:29,219 --> 00:29:32,818
Boy runs free. Robin fires
a flaming arrow and...

344
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:35,926
...bye-bye, diamonds.

345
00:29:40,243 --> 00:29:43,144
- What will you tell Hood?
- Oh, that's easy.

346
00:29:44,017 --> 00:29:45,473
I'll just say I was tumbled.

347
00:29:46,008 --> 00:29:48,395
You recognised me, we had a fight,

348
00:29:48,515 --> 00:29:50,497
which obviously I nearly won.

349
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:55,629
I left you for near dead, fleeing the
manor, dispatching guards as I go.

350
00:29:56,455 --> 00:29:57,689
Good idea. Mm.

351
00:30:02,018 --> 00:30:04,630
- What was that for? !
- Believability.

352
00:30:09,713 --> 00:30:10,483
Allan?

353
00:30:12,886 --> 00:30:15,690
- Quick. Let's go. Gisborne rumbled me.
- How did you get out?

354
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:19,426
We had a scrap. I knocked him out.
Unbelievable.

355
00:30:19,546 --> 00:30:21,762
Luckily, his guards didn't hear us,
but...

356
00:30:22,335 --> 00:30:24,834
- we should scarper before he comes to.
- Right. Come on.

357
00:30:24,954 --> 00:30:25,666
Robin...

358
00:30:27,003 --> 00:30:30,027
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, it's not your fault, is it?

359
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:33,820
We'll tell the others and Marian.
It's Mark's pitch plan. Come on!

360
00:31:06,055 --> 00:31:06,737
Right...

361
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:09,182
Let's go.

362
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:14,708
Guards, take your positions.
You, over there, move it! Move it!

363
00:31:18,464 --> 00:31:21,525
Here, boy. See that?

364
00:31:22,845 --> 00:31:24,021
If Robin Hood doesn't show up,

365
00:31:24,141 --> 00:31:26,241
these people here are going
to watch you swing.

366
00:31:26,577 --> 00:31:27,116
Sit.

367
00:31:31,314 --> 00:31:35,000
Well... I can see the sun,
no sign of your saviour.

368
00:31:35,348 --> 00:31:38,091
- He'll come.
- Well, let's hope so.

369
00:31:38,673 --> 00:31:39,453
For your sake!

370
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:41,833
Hood!

371
00:31:45,566 --> 00:31:48,070
Oh, Robin Hoo-oo-ood!

372
00:31:57,872 --> 00:31:59,112
Stay where you are, Hood.

373
00:32:02,126 --> 00:32:06,477
My smith will meet you in the
middle. Check the merchandise.

374
00:32:06,815 --> 00:32:09,761
If it's all right, you get
the key to the boy.

375
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:12,981
No, Sheriff! You can make the exchange.

376
00:32:13,101 --> 00:32:15,192
Otherwise your archers there will kill me.

377
00:32:15,671 --> 00:32:19,449
And if they do fire upon me,
my men will kill you.

378
00:32:20,162 --> 00:32:22,988
Out of the way! Clear!
Go to your houses. Move!

379
00:32:24,637 --> 00:32:27,501
Oh, lah-de-dah!

380
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:31,074
Right, let's get on with it.

381
00:32:33,597 --> 00:32:36,743
Allan, Djaq, take the archers
on the left. You two, with me.

382
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,869
Stop!

383
00:32:49,136 --> 00:32:51,662
You cannot release the child
to an outlaw.

384
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,881
Somebody find me a box and put this
woman inside it!

385
00:32:55,001 --> 00:32:58,233
Release him to me.
I'll see that he gets home safely.

386
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,796
Locksley, this makes no difference
to you. You have my word.

387
00:33:02,729 --> 00:33:05,348
- I accept these terms.
- Good for you.

388
00:33:07,564 --> 00:33:08,434
Go on, then.

389
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:10,700
Now...

390
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:14,598
...the black diamonds. Not yet!

391
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:17,948
Allow me to check
the merchandise first.

392
00:33:32,697 --> 00:33:34,638
Oh, so sorry.

393
00:33:35,408 --> 00:33:38,403
You are, after all,
as Lady Marian pointed out...

394
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,027
...a murderous outlaw.

395
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:48,383
- The Sheriff's guessed our plan.
- Unbelievable.

396
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,510
Something wrong, Hood?

397
00:33:58,174 --> 00:34:00,850
Gisborne! All yours.

398
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:12,844
That's the armour!

399
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:21,369
Enjoy!

400
00:34:23,206 --> 00:34:24,427
Robin!

401
00:34:26,848 --> 00:34:30,548
- Stay back! My sword!
- Master!

402
00:35:07,881 --> 00:35:09,230
Look at that!
Look at that!

403
00:35:12,463 --> 00:35:14,910
- What now, Locksley?
- Run!

404
00:35:27,318 --> 00:35:28,905
Master!

405
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:33,613
- Robin!
- Don't touch him. Stay with the archers.

406
00:35:38,242 --> 00:35:39,590
No, John! Wait!

407
00:35:53,907 --> 00:35:56,058
Locksley will
always be mine.

408
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:00,182
What's he doing?

409
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:03,550
Is that the best you can do?

410
00:36:04,451 --> 00:36:05,443
What now?

411
00:36:07,427 --> 00:36:11,555
Playing outlaws with the
children?! Goodbye, Hood!

412
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:15,614
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes!

413
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:45,060
Tell your men to withdraw, Sheriff!

414
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,481
Another exchange,

415
00:36:47,548 --> 00:36:50,760
the black diamonds for Gisborne.
And your other bag.

416
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:52,776
Well, 

417
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,497
- How long can you hold your breath?
- My lord, please!

418
00:36:56,175 --> 00:37:00,416
You... You seem to have overestimated
Gisborne's importance to me.

419
00:37:01,796 --> 00:37:03,440
Make sure he's safe.

420
00:37:06,973 --> 00:37:08,691
Not even you would let him die.

421
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:11,817
I have everything I could want.

422
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,578
- Sheriff!
- Not again...

423
00:37:16,756 --> 00:37:18,461
- Let him live!
- Who?

424
00:37:18,581 --> 00:37:19,479
Guy!

425
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:25,117
- Marian, what are you doing?
- I am asking you to reconsider.

426
00:37:25,237 --> 00:37:27,124
You are helping Hood!

427
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:32,554
Quite the opposite. I'm reminding you
that Sir Guy is your most loyal servant.

428
00:37:34,112 --> 00:37:36,610
- My lord, please!
- Let him die.

429
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,590
He is noble, and a good man.

430
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,363
He must be worth more to you
than a sack of rocks.

431
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:43,823
I will have those rocks.

432
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:48,448
Then I will kill this man.
Without him...

433
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:52,654
- are the rocks really any use?
- Eh...no. No, they are not.

434
00:37:52,908 --> 00:37:56,781
I'm the only man west of Jerusalem
who can make them work their magic.

435
00:38:01,657 --> 00:38:04,211
- My lord!
- Shut up!

436
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:12,076
My lord, I will
get you more rocks.

437
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:21,288
You'll be punished for this, Marian.

438
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:25,176
Be in no doubt.
You'll be punished.

439
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:32,445
Get out.

440
00:38:43,417 --> 00:38:44,628
Burn these.

441
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:17,769
You saved my life. I'm grateful.

442
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:20,862
I could not watch you die
and do nothing.

443
00:39:21,972 --> 00:39:25,974
- You saved Robin, too.
- That was incidental.

444
00:39:26,094 --> 00:39:26,950
Was it?

445
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,995
Marian, I've been assuming that
since Hood became an outlaw...

446
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:36,065
that you've had nothing further to do
with him. Was I wrong to assume that?

447
00:39:36,185 --> 00:39:38,044
- No.
- Because if you were,

448
00:39:38,164 --> 00:39:40,494
associating with an outlaw...

449
00:39:41,086 --> 00:39:44,696
the punishment would be more severe
than house arrest. The punishment...

450
00:39:45,526 --> 00:39:48,508
- would be death.
- Would you prefer me to have let you die?

451
00:39:53,283 --> 00:39:55,246
Gisborne. Stay there!

452
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,200
Wait, wait!

453
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:01,047
I cannot work in this environment.

454
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:04,908
My dear friend, we could make an
arrangement to increase your fee.

455
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:08,427
In France, they know
how to treat an artist.

456
00:40:16,396 --> 00:40:19,347
- What were you thinking?
- Guy is your faithful servant.

457
00:40:19,467 --> 00:40:21,229
I was preventing you 
from making a mistake.

458
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:23,377
You do not prevent me 
from making a mistake!

459
00:40:23,497 --> 00:40:27,755
- You must be punished!
- Well, I am ready for your punishment.

460
00:40:30,947 --> 00:40:34,098
Yes...but is your father?

461
00:40:34,218 --> 00:40:37,672
- You leave him out of this!
- Oh, I will leave him all right alone,

462
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:39,597
to rot in a dungeon.

463
00:40:39,717 --> 00:40:42,046
Until you learn
to behave yourself!

464
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,163
No.

465
00:40:57,228 --> 00:40:59,444
- A toast.
- Just hang on.

466
00:41:00,364 --> 00:41:02,270
Djaq, Will...

467
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:08,549
Good work, lads.

468
00:41:12,784 --> 00:41:16,925
You are now, honorary members
of our gang.

469
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:20,350
You are our eyes and ears
in the villages.

470
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:22,364
And any time you need us...

471
00:41:24,514 --> 00:41:25,716
...you can call on us.

472
00:41:26,164 --> 00:41:30,741
- Any time you need us, call on us.
- That's a deal.

473
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,910
We are Robin Hoods!

474
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:36,502
We are Robin Hoods!

475
00:41:40,192 --> 00:41:41,362
NEXT TIME

476
00:41:41,482 --> 00:41:43,139
The pestilence has come to Nottingham.

477
00:41:43,259 --> 00:41:45,540
- She's gonna die!
- No. That's not what she's got.

478
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,404
- Dad!
- Set up those barricades.

479
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:52,996
Let me through! This has got nothing
to do with me.

480
00:41:53,116 --> 00:41:54,092
Don't do this!

481
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:57,435
Someone's impersonating me.

482
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,483
- You poison people.
- He's going to kill the Sheriff.

483
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:03,984
- Don't I know you?
- You knew my dad, Dan.

484
00:42:04,664 --> 00:42:05,110
Will...
