1
00:00:01,831 --> 00:00:05,769
Quick! This way.
The barn. A girl in distress!

2
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:08,354
- What distress?
- Go.

3
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:15,925
- What is this?
- The girl is a pig!

4
00:00:16,487 --> 00:00:18,286
The pig is your present!

5
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:21,593
This is a party!
Happy birthday!

6
00:00:22,117 --> 00:00:23,566
Happy birthday.

7
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:25,945
Why here? Why not in the forest?

8
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:29,883
There's gratitude for you!
Cos it's a surprise!

9
00:00:30,354 --> 00:00:35,107
And besides, this way the people of
Nettlestone can join us and say thank you.

10
00:00:36,356 --> 00:00:38,557
Speaking of which,
where is everyone? George?

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,891
They couldn't make it.

12
00:00:41,284 --> 00:00:42,683
And neither can I.-

13
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:44,120
mean, they couldn't make it?

14
00:00:44,155 --> 00:00:46,449
This is Robin Hood's
birthday, where are they?

15
00:00:46,484 --> 00:00:48,130
- George?
- Sorry.

16
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:49,776
Sorry? What for?

17
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:52,792
Oh, Much.

18
00:01:00,098 --> 00:01:01,290
Thank you.

19
00:01:09,555 --> 00:01:11,083
Happy birthday, Robin Hood!

20
00:01:11,356 --> 00:01:12,423
- Who's that?
- Ellingham.

21
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:15,549
- The Sheriff sends his best.
- Leader ofthe Sheriff's mercenaries!

22
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:18,344
Not to mention his best men!

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,069
Much!

24
00:01:22,412 --> 00:01:23,700
Sorry!

28
00:02:04,796 --> 00:02:06,069
Will, Djaq, I need numbers.

29
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,546
Oh, I'm gonna die! Not because
of them, but because of shame!

30
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:13,514
- Much! Nobody is going to die!
- Why didn't I have it in the forest?

31
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:17,447
In the forest, not in a village where
we can be betrayed and surrounded!

32
00:02:18,593 --> 00:02:21,203
Nettlestone is getting
nothing this winter.

33
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,848
Much! Shut up!

34
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,135
- Do you have a plan?
- No.

35
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,894
- Half a plan?
- I don't have half a plan!

36
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,499
- How many, Djaq?
- 30, 40?

37
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:32,772
40?!
We're dead!

38
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,030
Wait.

39
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:38,591
There's more on that side. 100!

40
00:02:47,288 --> 00:02:48,560
They're coming!

41
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:52,081
Barricade the door.

42
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,297
No, wait!

43
00:02:54,116 --> 00:02:55,265
I've got this.

44
00:03:00,266 --> 00:03:02,546
Hood! Hood! Hood!

45
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:06,196
I'm sorry, Robin.
This was meant for your birthday.

46
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:09,900
Much, Will, open the door.

47
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:20,973
- What's that?
- A pig!

48
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,820
Black powder, Djaq?

49
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:32,566
I told you I never
wanted to see that again.

50
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:35,773
- I disobeyed you.
- Good.

51
00:03:36,586 --> 00:03:38,443
- Have you got any more?
- None.

52
00:03:41,123 --> 00:03:43,053
There's more where
that came from, Ellingham.

53
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:46,212
We've got enough black
powder to destroy a whole army!

54
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:47,630
You're bluffing!

55
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:51,877
Get a message to the Sheriff.

56
00:03:57,646 --> 00:03:59,063
Now, that should buy us some time.

57
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,911
We need to think.

58
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,792
There are five of us
and a hundred of them.

59
00:04:07,591 --> 00:04:11,145
Once, a few determined Spartans held
a pass against a vast Persian army.

60
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:13,273
- Really?
- Strategy.

61
00:04:13,308 --> 00:04:15,885
- And they lived?
- No.

62
00:04:17,118 --> 00:04:18,930
But they did well.

63
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:21,510
Oh. I hate that story, too.

64
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:27,462
Come in.

65
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:31,423
Today is the 14th October.

66
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,210
- Robin Hood's birthday.
- It is. It is?

67
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:37,970
Marian...

68
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:42,031
apart from your escapades
as the Nightwatchman,

69
00:04:42,507 --> 00:04:45,310
is there anything else
that you'd like to tell me?

70
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:48,595
No.

71
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:50,626
Good.

72
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:55,508
Well, I came to tell you
that I'm going away.

73
00:04:55,803 --> 00:04:58,267
- Away? Where?
- I cannot say.

74
00:04:59,354 --> 00:05:02,562
But when I return,
things will be different.

75
00:05:02,964 --> 00:05:05,819
Better for me.
Better for us.

76
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:07,471
Guy, what's going on?

77
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:09,422
Marian, I will not be
here to supervise you.

78
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:11,962
I must be assured that
the Nightwatchman is finished.

79
00:05:11,997 --> 00:05:16,645
- Yes, but... Where are you going?
- Marian, do I have your word?

80
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:22,022
You have my word.

81
00:05:28,923 --> 00:05:30,618
Are we going to kill them?

82
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:32,099
Yes!

83
00:05:32,756 --> 00:05:36,237
- Are we going to like it?
- Yes!

84
00:05:36,272 --> 00:05:40,030
- Are we going to kill them?
- Yes!

85
00:05:40,065 --> 00:05:42,363
Are we going to like it?

86
00:05:42,398 --> 00:05:45,624
- Yes!
- Are we going to kill them?

87
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:47,603
Yes!

88
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,325
- Are we going to like it?
- Horrible...

89
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:52,491
Don't take any notice.

90
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:55,491
All they're trying to
do is mess with our heads.

91
00:05:56,052 --> 00:05:57,484
It shows they're
playing for time.

92
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,549
See if there's any water in
those barrels and fill those buckets.

93
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:03,434
- Why?
- In case they try to burn us out!

94
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:07,488
- Are we going to like it?
- Course.

95
00:06:07,523 --> 00:06:11,385
- Are we going to kill them?
- Yes!

96
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:14,170
We're going to love it.

97
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,941
Keep an eye on that bag, yeah?

98
00:06:34,407 --> 00:06:36,997
- Your boy is ready?
- Looks like it.

99
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,688
- He knows where we're going?
- I told him Portsmouth. That's it.

100
00:06:39,723 --> 00:06:41,627
- Good.
- My Lord, the mercenaries,

101
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:43,139
are you sure we
shouldn't bring them?

102
00:06:43,157 --> 00:06:45,958
With any luck, by now they'll
be celebrating Hood's birthday.

103
00:06:47,638 --> 00:06:52,070
No, we'll do this alone, quietly.

104
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,216
Have they told you why?

105
00:06:57,632 --> 00:07:00,184
We going to Portsmouth,
that's alll know, Marian. All right?

106
00:07:00,785 --> 00:07:02,765
- You didn't get that from me.
- You know what this means?

107
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,899
- No.
- The King.

108
00:07:03,934 --> 00:07:06,388
They must be expecting the
King to land in Portsmouth.

109
00:07:06,423 --> 00:07:08,843
- It could be anything.
- That's not good enough Allan.

110
00:07:10,112 --> 00:07:11,575
Now, what if it is the King?

111
00:07:12,072 --> 00:07:14,314
You know what they'll do
to him when he arrives.

112
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:17,128
It's not my call, is it?
I'm the whipping boy around here.

113
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:18,033
The packing boy.

114
00:07:18,068 --> 00:07:21,821
Look, if you go along with treason,
then you are committing treason.

115
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:23,287
Rubbish.

116
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:26,840
If you go along with farting, doesn't
mean you've farted yourself, does it?

117
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:29,717
What's happened to you?

118
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,803
I've learned which side
my bread's buttered on.

119
00:07:43,893 --> 00:07:45,596
Robin!

120
00:07:51,357 --> 00:07:52,742
Robin!

121
00:07:53,317 --> 00:07:54,767
Where are you?

122
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,704
I need to stop the Sheriff.

123
00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:04,652
Come along, you blithering oaf!

124
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:06,601
We haven't got all day! Gently!

125
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,624
Move! Tanning cream.
Bottles of... Ah!

126
00:08:12,106 --> 00:08:13,812
News from Nettlestone?
Nice?

127
00:08:14,683 --> 00:08:16,444
Nasty?
Both?

128
00:08:17,882 --> 00:08:19,156
Small problem.

129
00:08:20,278 --> 00:08:22,680
Exploding fire?
What do you mean, exploding fire?

130
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,371
Black powder.

131
00:08:26,148 --> 00:08:27,315
Yes, I know what it is!

132
00:08:27,668 --> 00:08:30,324
We want permission to burn
down the barn. They'll be toast.

133
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:32,632
Are you deaf?
I told you.

134
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:36,631
I want Robin Hood's pretty little face,
on his pretty little head,

135
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:41,917
attached to his pretty little body on
a pretty big spike outside my castle!

136
00:08:42,175 --> 00:08:44,222
Then what do we do?
He's got food in there for a week.

137
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:49,009
I don't care what you do!
I don't care how long it takes!

138
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:51,815
Bring me Hood's body on a spike!

139
00:09:13,195 --> 00:09:14,928
Right.
John, Will, Djaq.

140
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:17,104
Everyone, get ready to run.

141
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,231
What are you doing?

142
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:22,242
I'm the one who go us in
this situation, I'll get us out of it.

143
00:09:22,277 --> 00:09:24,918
I'll go out the front,
I'll pretend to negotiate,

144
00:09:24,953 --> 00:09:28,455
I'll distract them, you make
good your escape. If I die...

145
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:32,263
- remember me fondly.
- Much...

146
00:09:32,298 --> 00:09:33,900
- Stop!
- What are you doing?

147
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,315
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

148
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:43,240
I'm unarmed. I'm here to
surrender and negotiate...

149
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:51,316
Thank you!
Horrible people.

150
00:09:52,362 --> 00:09:53,571
Revolting.

151
00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:06,103
Allan.
I can't find Robin.

152
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:07,920
I wouldn't worry about it.

153
00:10:07,943 --> 00:10:09,286
This trip, it'sjust me, Giz and the Sheriff.

154
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:11,509
No soldiers, no mercenaries.

155
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,966
I don't think it's the King, Marian.

156
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:15,846
Yes, welll do. And I'm going to stop it.

157
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,615
- How?
- I don't know.

158
00:10:18,582 --> 00:10:20,022
I'll kill the Sheriff if I have to.

159
00:10:20,438 --> 00:10:23,959
What? Have you forgotten what
happens if the Sheriff dies?

160
00:10:23,994 --> 00:10:24,845
No.

161
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,957
Prince john's armies will
raze Nottingham to the ground.

162
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:28,104
So, leave it.

163
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:31,420
Yes, if the King is in the south, that's
where Prince john's men will be.

164
00:10:31,526 --> 00:10:33,156
Nottingham will be safe.

165
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:34,622
That's a lot of assumptions there.

166
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:37,711
And if I prevent the
Sheriff from killing the King,

167
00:10:38,218 --> 00:10:41,834
then that's the King back on the throne.
That's the end of Prince john.

168
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:44,275
The end of the Black Knights
and the end of their threats.

169
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,306
So... You want to save
England single-handedly?

170
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:47,919
No, but I can't find Robin!

171
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:52,071
Gisborne and the Sheriff are ready to leave.
There's no time. Will you help me?

172
00:10:52,106 --> 00:10:54,581
- Sorry, you're out of your depth.
- No, I'm sorry.

173
00:10:56,902 --> 00:10:58,950
You underestimate me.

174
00:11:07,895 --> 00:11:09,608
Allan!

175
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:23,203
My Lords, wonderful news...

176
00:11:25,164 --> 00:11:26,634
My Lords...

177
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,373
Glorious news.

178
00:11:34,548 --> 00:11:39,405
We, the Black Knights, stand
on the verge of greatness.

179
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:46,987
We did not wait for Mohammed
to come to the mountain. No.

180
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,971
We took the mountain
to Mohammed!

181
00:11:52,724 --> 00:11:55,901
We did not wait
for the King to land...

182
00:12:00,546 --> 00:12:04,347
Mistake, missy. Big mistake.

183
00:12:21,181 --> 00:12:22,948
We've got time, Hood.

184
00:12:23,662 --> 00:12:26,622
- All the time in the world.
- Us too!

185
00:12:26,657 --> 00:12:29,606
Would you like some more
roast hog while you're waiting?

186
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:33,133
I don't understand.
What kind of soldiers are these?

187
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:35,445
They're not doing anything.

188
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,521
Mercenaries. They fight
for money, not passion.

189
00:12:40,504 --> 00:12:43,089
That is why. They do not
want to fight and die.

190
00:12:43,658 --> 00:12:45,289
So, what, you think they're
just going to wait?

191
00:12:45,353 --> 00:12:47,190
Yep. Looks like it.

192
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:50,422
And we can't escape from here.

193
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,566
They're just going to
wait until we come out.

194
00:12:55,222 --> 00:12:57,733
And then kill us.
Not even a conversation.

195
00:13:07,556 --> 00:13:09,386
You missed all the fun, Gisborne.

196
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:13,218
Your leper friend tried to kill me.

197
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:19,546
- Did you know about this?
- I didn't know anything.

198
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:23,259
Why would he know
anything about this?

199
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:25,396
She knocked him
out and took his sword.

200
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:27,600
- What?
- Well, I wasn't expecting it, was I?

201
00:13:27,635 --> 00:13:30,888
It wouldn't have happened.
Yeah, she's good. I'm better though.

202
00:13:43,985 --> 00:13:46,826
'She's good,
but I'm better. '

203
00:13:47,466 --> 00:13:52,436
That means you knew
she was capable of this.

204
00:13:57,107 --> 00:14:00,133
- You knew, too, didn't you?
- My Lord, please, I can explain.

205
00:14:00,168 --> 00:14:05,649
Well, you better had explain because
she just made an attempt on my life!

206
00:14:11,694 --> 00:14:15,127
I recently discovered that
Marian was the Nightwatchman.

207
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:23,023
What?
And you didn't tell me!

208
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:25,063
I believed Marian's days as
the Nightwatchman were over.

209
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,729
- I believed I had dealt with it.
- By tricking me!

210
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,705
By faking her escape?!

211
00:14:32,146 --> 00:14:34,002
Who was it who ran away?

212
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,945
Look, I was just following
orders, all right?

213
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:38,989
- I gave the order.
- Why?

214
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,419
I thought Marian's instincts were
misguided and did not merit hanging.

215
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:44,609
Oh, how very noble of you, dear boy.

216
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,101
I can't help thinking that maybe
you wanted something in return.

217
00:14:48,758 --> 00:14:52,445
A display of gratitude?
Oh, the Nightwatchman!

218
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,729
- I'm impressed!
- Get off me!

219
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:57,563
Guards!
Pack a trunk for Lady Marian.

220
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,323
- She's coming with us.
- To the Holy Land?

221
00:15:04,343 --> 00:15:05,753
Oh, yes.

222
00:15:07,984 --> 00:15:10,136
Oh, look, look, the look.

223
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:11,977
So eloquent.

224
00:15:12,234 --> 00:15:14,666
'Oh, Guy, what's going to happen?'

225
00:15:16,738 --> 00:15:19,588
Well, we just don't know, do we, missy?

226
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,284
Listen, Guy, the Holy Land?

227
00:15:29,821 --> 00:15:34,643
Is this what I think it is?
Are we killing the King?

228
00:15:34,678 --> 00:15:36,917
You're part of the inner sanctum now,
Allan. You should be honoured.

229
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,747
No, no. I am. I am. It's
just... the Holy Land?

230
00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:44,314
This is the ultimate mission.
It carries with it the ultimate prize.

231
00:15:44,556 --> 00:15:46,464
Absolute power.

232
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:49,256
- Yeah, for you and the Sheriff.
- And you.

233
00:15:49,643 --> 00:15:52,648
Allan, your loyalty will be
rewarded in land and title.

234
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:54,144
- I'll see to that.
- Really?

235
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:55,608
- Really.
- What you mean...

236
00:15:56,992 --> 00:15:58,360
Like a lordship or something?

237
00:16:28,493 --> 00:16:29,605
Now what?

238
00:16:41,663 --> 00:16:44,910
This is driving me mad! Why don't
they just come in here and kill us?

239
00:16:44,945 --> 00:16:46,818
Cos there's no incentive, Much.

240
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:50,526
Every hour that goes by,
we become more fearful,

241
00:16:51,576 --> 00:16:54,901
more tired, more likely
to take foolish action.

242
00:16:54,936 --> 00:16:57,149
Foolish action was bringing
us here in the first place.

243
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,332
I've said I'm sorry.

244
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,480
That's not good enough.

245
00:17:00,326 --> 00:17:03,405
Oh, you've never made a mistake
I'm not saying anything!

246
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:04,959
- What?
- I'm not saying anything.

247
00:17:04,994 --> 00:17:06,005
You brought the Sheriff to our camp!

248
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:12,045
- You showed him where we lived.
- I was trying to feed the poor!

249
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,875
That's what we used to do!
What's this all about?

250
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,636
- Feeding your fat face!
- Fat face! Look who's talking!

251
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:21,151
Shut up, the pair of you!

252
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,685
This is exactly what
they want us to do.

253
00:17:25,505 --> 00:17:27,466
Fighting amongst ourselves
and save them the trouble.

254
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,113
Don't give them the satisfaction!

255
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:38,228
- In fact, I think we need to relax.
- Relax?!

256
00:17:38,263 --> 00:17:39,627
I don't know why
I didn't think of this before.

257
00:17:39,662 --> 00:17:43,051
It's my birthday.
Let's celebrate. Let's eat.

258
00:17:46,203 --> 00:17:46,965
I haven't got a fat face.

259
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,301
- Fat face.
- Badger beard!

260
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:54,527
Are you seriously going
to the Holy Land?

261
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,940
Yes, yes.

262
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:58,471
I've never been before, have you?

263
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:00,836
They say the weather's wonderful.

264
00:18:02,924 --> 00:18:06,333
Guy's been before, haven't you, Gizzy?

265
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:08,333
You've been before?

266
00:18:10,717 --> 00:18:11,990
Then it's true?

267
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,920
You tried to kill the King.

268
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:18,544
What? Do you feel betrayed?

269
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,116
Are you going to try
to kill the King again?

270
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:23,330
YES.

271
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:26,552
You could say that
it's Robin Hood's fault.

272
00:18:26,587 --> 00:18:29,714
You see, Robin did warn the King to
be on his guard when he lands.

273
00:18:30,146 --> 00:18:35,412
So, first plan, mercenaries in
the port, dead in the water.

274
00:18:37,035 --> 00:18:40,278
The new plan, instead of waiting
for him, we pay him a little visit.

275
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:42,933
Mohammed not coming
to the mountain.

276
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,165
Indeed. Shall I use that?

277
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:00,776
Quite good.

278
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:05,713
Are you listening, Robin Hood?

279
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,103
Be careful.

280
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,866
We thought you might
like some apple with your pork!

281
00:19:32,226 --> 00:19:33,978
Enjoy your meal!

282
00:19:34,346 --> 00:19:37,778
And just to let you know, we
won't be troubling you tonight.

283
00:19:38,158 --> 00:19:39,407
Or tomorrow.

284
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,511
- We're going to starve you out of there!
- You better come back next Tuesday then.

285
00:19:44,765 --> 00:19:47,357
We've got enough food and
water to last a week here!

286
00:19:47,765 --> 00:19:49,726
A week?
Is that all you can last?

287
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:51,589
What a shame!

288
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,660
The Sheriff's paying us by the day!

289
00:19:56,614 --> 00:19:59,247
Ah. You're a funny man!
Do us a favour.

290
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:03,633
Next time, bring some
mustard as well, will ya?

291
00:20:06,977 --> 00:20:09,163
- We don't have water for a week.
- I know that.

292
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:12,090
- What are we going to do?
- Do you think they're bluffing?

293
00:20:12,427 --> 00:20:15,747
It doesn't matter.
Either way we're beaten.

294
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,831
Well, one thing's for certain,
we can'tjust sit here and eat pork!

295
00:20:21,143 --> 00:20:22,575
Lads...

296
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,816
I've got a proposal.

297
00:20:29,224 --> 00:20:31,928
- If they don't come to us, we go to them.
- When?

298
00:20:32,209 --> 00:20:33,431
- First light.
- There's too many.

299
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:34,969
- We'll die.
- It's suicide.

300
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,646
- A good day to die.
- Will you just shut up?

301
00:20:42,681 --> 00:20:46,080
Why does he say that?
I don't even know what it means!

302
00:20:46,115 --> 00:20:47,777
We'll almost certainly die.

303
00:20:49,203 --> 00:20:51,788
- But at least we'll die fighting.
- Yeah, I'm in.

304
00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:54,206
- Me too.
- Yes.

305
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,213
- And me.
- Good, good.

306
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,167
Then tonight is a Kalilah
and Dimnah night.

307
00:21:06,262 --> 00:21:07,411
What?

308
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,982
You don't have Kalilah and Dimnah?

309
00:21:09,653 --> 00:21:11,070
Surprisingly not.

310
00:21:11,495 --> 00:21:13,941
Kalilah and Dimnah night,
you remember for your whole life.

311
00:21:14,238 --> 00:21:17,214
You must speak only the truth.
You must ask all your questions.

312
00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:20,957
Share all your dreams.
Confess all your secrets.

313
00:21:20,992 --> 00:21:22,943
- It's just talking.
- Yes!

314
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:24,370
But it's real talking.

315
00:21:25,466 --> 00:21:30,357
And if you're too boring, someone shouts
Kalilah and you lose your turn. You start.

316
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,004
- Oh, no.
- Just talk. You like talking.

317
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:38,163
- I knowl do, but... not like this.
- Fine, then I'll start.

318
00:21:49,778 --> 00:21:51,905
- How many beds are you after?
- Three.

319
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,071
- And you, with the horses?
- No, no. This one.

320
00:21:58,778 --> 00:22:00,011
You'd better not sleep tonight.

321
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:02,703
Robin Hood will find
out what you're doing

322
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,958
and he will come
and he will stop you.

323
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:08,072
It's Robin Hood's birthday
today, did you know that?

324
00:22:08,721 --> 00:22:11,408
He's having a party
in Nettlestone village.

325
00:22:13,393 --> 00:22:17,730
And somebody has invited one
hundred of my fiercest mercenaries.

326
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:22,073
And they've got him surrounded.

327
00:22:22,595 --> 00:22:25,154
So... So, Robin Hood is no more.

328
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,453
Well, sleep tight.
Don't let the horse flies bite.

329
00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:39,382
Allan! Allan!

330
00:22:44,318 --> 00:22:46,726
- You can't go through with this.
- Yes, I can.

331
00:22:47,543 --> 00:22:49,318
You heard them, Marian.
Robin's finished.

332
00:22:49,353 --> 00:22:50,998
Not if we get away.

333
00:22:51,814 --> 00:22:53,134
We'll go back to Nottingham.

334
00:22:54,535 --> 00:22:55,999
We have to help him.

335
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,160
- Allan!
- Coming.

336
00:23:10,945 --> 00:23:12,297
So, I admire you.

337
00:23:13,106 --> 00:23:17,040
All of you.
You are a good man.

338
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:21,231
Brave, generous, kind,

339
00:23:21,998 --> 00:23:24,695
decent men and I love you.

340
00:23:25,574 --> 00:23:26,823
All of you.

341
00:23:28,183 --> 00:23:30,174
And I am proud
to be amongst you-

342
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,650
Is this just everyone saying
they love each other?

343
00:23:31,685 --> 00:23:34,295
Wait...
And you're filthy.

344
00:23:34,954 --> 00:23:37,260
And you really stink
and you have no souls.

345
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:39,979
- We live in the forest.
- I have to be honest!

346
00:23:43,145 --> 00:23:44,801
I have to be honest.

347
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,074
And if I am being honest...

348
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:52,991
I have to say...

349
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:58,240
that I do not love all
of you in the same way.

350
00:23:58,241 --> 00:23:59,417
It's me, isn't it?

351
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:01,579
You love everyone, but you don't
love me. Brilliant.

352
00:24:01,614 --> 00:24:03,219
There is one...

353
00:24:04,907 --> 00:24:06,699
I do love.

354
00:24:07,236 --> 00:24:09,069
More than the others.

355
00:24:09,507 --> 00:24:11,243
The way a bird would...

356
00:24:11,693 --> 00:24:14,556
fly two thousand miles,

357
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:19,638
through storms, just to
be with the one he loves!

358
00:24:20,686 --> 00:24:22,734
That is the love I feel.

359
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,817
And I am a fool! Because it is only now,
when we are about to die...

360
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:38,266
that I have the courage
to admit it, even to myself.

361
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,923
I'm sorry.

362
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:46,753
- I should have said earlier.
- Will!

363
00:24:47,735 --> 00:24:48,847
I knew it.

364
00:24:49,478 --> 00:24:53,911
You, Will Scarlett, are strong and true.

365
00:24:54,215 --> 00:24:56,968
And you fight for what you believe in.

366
00:24:57,248 --> 00:24:58,809
And that's why I love you.

367
00:24:59,088 --> 00:25:00,361
And I love you.

368
00:25:01,226 --> 00:25:03,240
I love the way you
say what you mean.

369
00:25:03,904 --> 00:25:06,418
- I love your silly voice.
- Silly voice?

370
00:25:06,453 --> 00:25:10,968
That's it. I take it back all of it.
I hate you.

371
00:25:11,003 --> 00:25:14,088
And I love
the way you fight like a man.

372
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,288
Ferocious!

373
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:23,362
And the way you will always,
always be a woman.

374
00:25:23,753 --> 00:25:25,098
Kalimnah! Boring!

375
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:27,018
- Kalilah!
- Whatever.

376
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,469
Can I trust you?

377
00:25:50,637 --> 00:25:51,958
Yeah, of course.

378
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:55,583
- Tell me.
- Tell you what?

379
00:25:55,618 --> 00:25:57,649
Robin Hood and Marian.

380
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:00,874
What about them?

381
00:26:02,003 --> 00:26:05,211
They're still... aren't they?

382
00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:09,603
Even if they were,
he's finished now, right?

383
00:26:09,638 --> 00:26:11,538
That is not an answer, Allan.
I need to know.

384
00:26:15,944 --> 00:26:17,982
What's this,
kissing in the moonlight?

385
00:26:18,508 --> 00:26:20,731
Shall I go out and come in again?
What do you think?

386
00:26:20,766 --> 00:26:23,417
- Go to bed.
- Yeah.

387
00:26:29,896 --> 00:26:31,288
John?

388
00:26:32,297 --> 00:26:33,328
No.

389
00:26:33,632 --> 00:26:36,440
- John, come on.
- Who do you love?

390
00:26:40,705 --> 00:26:43,402
You. All of you.
Even him.

391
00:26:44,081 --> 00:26:45,514
I love you all. All right?

392
00:26:58,804 --> 00:27:00,469
And Alice.

393
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,557
I shouldn't have let her go.

394
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:05,269
And my boy.

395
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,253
Little Little john.

396
00:27:09,014 --> 00:27:11,767
I should have...
made them stay.

397
00:27:12,095 --> 00:27:14,646
- John, you didn't have a choice.
- Let me speak.

398
00:27:16,024 --> 00:27:21,537
Leaving Alice, running
to the forest... was wrong.

399
00:27:22,977 --> 00:27:24,553
Wrong.

400
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:31,290
That's why I'm a huge, ugly,
stupid, useless COWARD!

401
00:27:31,925 --> 00:27:34,869
- John!
- That's why I'm always saying it, Much.

402
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:39,368
Today is a good day to die.
Because for me it is.

403
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:45,118
I deserve to die.
I left the people that loved me.

404
00:27:45,153 --> 00:27:49,066
The two people that should
have depended on me. My own child!

405
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,537
- What was I thinking?!
- John?

406
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,039
I'll not let you talk like this.

407
00:27:58,265 --> 00:27:59,616
I'm going now.

408
00:28:00,337 --> 00:28:01,921
- I won't wait till tomorrow.
- John.

409
00:28:01,956 --> 00:28:03,173
Let's move this cart.

410
00:28:06,214 --> 00:28:07,719
I need to die!

411
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:10,743
I want to die! Let me die!

412
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,358
- Let me die!
- John!

413
00:28:12,393 --> 00:28:15,070
Let me die! I want to die!

414
00:28:16,146 --> 00:28:18,491
Is this normal with
this Kalimnah thing?

415
00:28:19,483 --> 00:28:20,922
Cos it's weird.

416
00:29:01,113 --> 00:29:03,065
Robin, sorry.

417
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,075
Look, I'm not doing this.

418
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,530
- Fine.
- Good...

419
00:29:11,807 --> 00:29:14,447
Because I don't hate myself and
I'm not in love with anyone else so...

420
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,401
- Fine.
- Fine. There's nothing to say, then.

421
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:21,885
What?

422
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,165
What?

423
00:29:24,565 --> 00:29:25,846
You're smiling.

424
00:29:26,573 --> 00:29:29,806
I'm smiling because usually it's
a struggle to shut you up.

425
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,558
You think I talk too much?

426
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,959
Well, I know that's what you think.

427
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,432
Much talks too much.

428
00:29:39,246 --> 00:29:41,399
And eats too much,
worries too much.

429
00:29:43,392 --> 00:29:46,247
That's easy for you to say
because if I don't do it, then who does?

430
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,962
It's all right for you.

431
00:29:47,997 --> 00:29:50,377
You can breeze through
life and be everyone's hero!

432
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:53,431
and not worry about things
like the fire or food

433
00:29:53,432 --> 00:29:56,416
or a hole in your cape
or your birthday.

434
00:29:56,913 --> 00:30:00,715
Because good old, dependable
old Much will take care of that.

435
00:30:01,963 --> 00:30:05,043
Well, I'll tell you something,
you take me for granted.

436
00:30:05,915 --> 00:30:07,878
- You're sniggering.
- Much! I'm just saying...

437
00:30:07,913 --> 00:30:09,487
And you shouldn't!

438
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,759
And I'm angry!

439
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:19,601
And just because I love you, it
doesn't mean I can't hate you, too.

440
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:22,398
And I hate you,
because in the Holy Land

441
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:26,456
there was two of us and we were a
team and the things we went through,

442
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:30,054
the horrors we saw, we
went through them together.

443
00:30:30,482 --> 00:30:33,578
And when we came home we
were like brothers, brothers in arms.

444
00:30:35,287 --> 00:30:36,912
And where is that now, eh?

445
00:30:38,287 --> 00:30:40,128
It's gone. That's where!

446
00:30:42,693 --> 00:30:45,591
We never talk.
We just don't.

447
00:30:48,935 --> 00:30:52,361
You made me a free man and
we're meant to be equals.

448
00:30:54,816 --> 00:30:56,451
We're not equals.

449
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:00,153
The only thing that's changed around
here is you treat me like a servant,

450
00:31:00,188 --> 00:31:01,892
you don't treat me like your friend.

451
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,612
That's not true.

452
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:10,597
Is it true?

453
00:31:18,368 --> 00:31:20,144
Kalilah.

454
00:31:22,192 --> 00:31:24,953
Well, they're not coming
tonight, that's for sure.

455
00:31:29,794 --> 00:31:31,897
We'll make a
plan for the morning.

456
00:31:37,884 --> 00:31:39,069
Allan!

457
00:31:40,473 --> 00:31:42,376
- Thank you.
- I can't get the key.

458
00:31:42,918 --> 00:31:44,766
Go. Go quickly.

459
00:31:46,007 --> 00:31:48,864
What about you, though?
You've crossed the Sheriff now.

460
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:52,239
I'll be fine. Go. Save Robin.

461
00:31:53,939 --> 00:31:55,228
Go.

462
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,668
Who's there?

463
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,751
I heard voices.

464
00:32:19,725 --> 00:32:21,661
We stay tight up until this point.

465
00:32:22,581 --> 00:32:23,981
And then we divide.

466
00:32:25,494 --> 00:32:28,046
Is everybody clear? Show me.

467
00:32:29,294 --> 00:32:30,448
I go here.

468
00:32:30,775 --> 00:32:32,400
Will and I... here.

469
00:32:32,838 --> 00:32:34,616
And then you switch positions
and you cover from the back.

470
00:32:36,184 --> 00:32:37,639
And after that?

471
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,752
Much, I don't think there's
going to be an after that.

472
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:43,169
Yeah, I know.

473
00:32:43,577 --> 00:32:45,481
First light. Nearly dawn.

474
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,579
This is it.

475
00:32:54,283 --> 00:32:55,788
This is really it.

476
00:32:57,222 --> 00:32:58,668
Forget what I said.

477
00:33:00,547 --> 00:33:02,668
I don't want you to die
remembering me that way.

478
00:33:04,126 --> 00:33:06,565
I'll remember you as my loyal friend.

479
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:16,255
Right, let's get the weapons ready.

480
00:33:16,855 --> 00:33:19,129
As soon as there is
light to see by, we go.

481
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,729
No.

482
00:33:23,008 --> 00:33:24,951
- No!
- John, we agreed this.

483
00:33:26,792 --> 00:33:30,433
You have not spoken, Robin.
It's your turn.

484
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:35,024
We have a few
moments left on this earth.

485
00:33:35,938 --> 00:33:38,432
Let me have my
thoughts to myself.

486
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:40,716
I'll share them
with you in the next life.

487
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:45,666
Robin, if there is a heaven,
yours is different from mine.

488
00:33:46,585 --> 00:33:47,943
If there isn't a heaven?

489
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,176
- It's almost light.
- Robin.

490
00:33:54,572 --> 00:33:56,572
You know my thoughts.

491
00:33:58,061 --> 00:33:59,799
They are for the poor.

492
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:01,814
They are for you.

493
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:06,014
And they're for Marian.

494
00:34:07,391 --> 00:34:09,150
The woman I love.

495
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:14,069
- The woman I recently gave a ring to...
- You're engaged?

496
00:34:17,927 --> 00:34:19,607
The woman who makes
me believe that,

497
00:34:19,913 --> 00:34:22,639
by a twist of fate, we might
just be able to see this through.

498
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,920
And Much, I have
betrayed your friendship.

499
00:34:29,882 --> 00:34:31,626
But I think you know why.

500
00:34:33,874 --> 00:34:36,889
You see I can't face
the terrors we saw, I can't.

501
00:34:38,235 --> 00:34:40,003
Because I'm not as strong as you.

502
00:34:41,812 --> 00:34:47,700
I have to put them out of my mind because
if I don't, then I wouldn't be able to lead.

503
00:34:49,126 --> 00:34:51,084
I mean, Iwouldn't even be able to...

504
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,981
What?

505
00:34:54,415 --> 00:34:56,590
- It doesn't matter.
- Be able to shoot?

506
00:34:57,564 --> 00:35:00,434
Shoot?
Of course, he can shoot.

507
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:05,914
No. john's right.

508
00:35:11,364 --> 00:35:15,843
In the Holy Land, the men we saw, in bits...

509
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,820
screaming.

510
00:35:22,765 --> 00:35:26,197
Every time I raise my bow, I see them.

511
00:35:27,822 --> 00:35:29,574
I hear them.

512
00:35:30,038 --> 00:35:34,334
And I know now,
whether it was right or wrong,

513
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:39,664
what we did in the Holy Land,
it makes no difference.

514
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:46,769
So, I have to try not to kill.
I have to avoid killing.

515
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:53,247
I mean, God gave me a gift with bow.

516
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:58,495
I can kill with my eyes closed, I mean,
I can kill a man from a thousand yards.

517
00:35:58,984 --> 00:36:03,383
And I have to try
everything in my power not to.

518
00:36:07,745 --> 00:36:12,515
And that's why I wasn't there for
you in your hour of need, my friend.

519
00:36:12,866 --> 00:36:15,577
Because I have to let
those memories go.

520
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,693
I just have to be free.

521
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,731
Why didn't you say?

522
00:36:26,835 --> 00:36:28,586
It doesn't matter now.

523
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:31,507
In a few moments, we'll be free for ever.

524
00:36:48,351 --> 00:36:53,131
Well...
here's to freedom.

525
00:36:54,216 --> 00:36:55,913
Here's to the poor.

526
00:36:56,905 --> 00:36:59,778
Here's to the good
people we leave behind.

527
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:04,801
- We are Robin Hood.
- We are Robin Hood.

528
00:37:07,219 --> 00:37:09,130
Thank you, my friends.

529
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:30,133
I should have let you
look after me, Guy.

530
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,382
I should have let you.

531
00:37:32,886 --> 00:37:34,750
I'm your boy.

532
00:37:35,037 --> 00:37:36,848
I'm nothing without you.

533
00:37:36,883 --> 00:37:40,688
Right from the very beginning,
I should have let you look after me.

534
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:54,531
Guy, don't be too disappointed.

535
00:37:55,531 --> 00:37:57,401
- What?
- Your boy, Allan.

536
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:01,396
He doesn't love you any more.
He's run away, he's lost his nerve.

537
00:38:02,604 --> 00:38:05,292
- I'll find him.
- No, no, no...

538
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:09,054
Let him go.
We don't need him.

539
00:38:09,598 --> 00:38:11,837
It's better this way.
just us.

540
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,743
What do you think, john? A good day?

541
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,337
Yes. A good day.

542
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:53,180
Morning.
Allan A Dale, Gisborne's man.

543
00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:55,176
- Looking for Ellingham?
- That's me.

544
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,433
Sheriff sent me on an errand.

545
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,513
He wants me to take the
outlaws to him at the castle.

546
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:03,040
No. Sheriff says they have
to stay in there till they rot.

547
00:39:03,075 --> 00:39:04,496
Or till they come out to be shot.

548
00:39:04,531 --> 00:39:06,520
- Yeah? He's changed his mind.
- Why?

549
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:09,042
It turns out they might
have some information he needs.

550
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:12,219
I think it's probably...

551
00:39:12,906 --> 00:39:14,724
you know, Black Knight stuff.

552
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,501
You'll be paid in full, obviously.

553
00:39:26,837 --> 00:39:30,117
- God speed till we meet again.
- See you in heaven, my friends.

554
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:36,491
Excuse me, gents.
Coming through.

555
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:39,298
Thank you.

556
00:39:40,602 --> 00:39:43,746
Right, let's move out!
Move out!

557
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:48,885
Be ready.

558
00:39:49,693 --> 00:39:51,469
One... Two...

559
00:39:51,637 --> 00:39:53,110
- Allan!
- What?

560
00:39:53,145 --> 00:39:54,901
- Allan A. Dale!
- What?!

561
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,503
Open up!
I'm here on behalf of the Sheriff.

562
00:40:02,905 --> 00:40:03,727
- Let him in.
- Kill him!

563
00:40:03,762 --> 00:40:05,799
Calm down.

564
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:09,247
Oh, thank God.

565
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,569
What do you want?

566
00:40:10,604 --> 00:40:12,550
- What do you want?
- Listen!

567
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:15,798
We haven't got time to talk now, all right?
I've spun them a yarn.

568
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:17,143
We've got to get out
of here before they...

569
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:18,145
We?! We?!

570
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,466
I'm with you. Trust me.

571
00:40:22,691 --> 00:40:25,131
I've been an idiot. I'm sorry.

572
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:26,150
*********

573
00:40:26,185 --> 00:40:27,830
The Sheriff and Gisborne
are going to the Holy Land.

574
00:40:28,151 --> 00:40:30,117
- The Holy Land?
- They're on a boat from Portsmouth.

575
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,358
They're going to kill the King.

576
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:40,893
Right, we need to get
out of here. Now.

577
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:56,822
Sea air, Gisborne.
Sea air.

578
00:41:02,566 --> 00:41:03,792
Well, come along.

579
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:07,849
Give Gizzy a little kiss. No?

580
00:41:10,473 --> 00:41:13,784
On ward, driver, let's go
and kill a king, shall we?

581
00:41:19,198 --> 00:41:21,721
It's all right, it's all right.
They're coming quietly.

582
00:41:21,756 --> 00:41:23,321
The show's over.

583
00:41:26,302 --> 00:41:29,448
One thing. I got to get this
rabble back to the castle somehow.

584
00:41:29,483 --> 00:41:33,978
Sure. The Sheriff wants to
talk tothe outlaws in the castle?

585
00:41:34,013 --> 00:41:35,895
- Yeah.
- Strange that,

586
00:41:36,073 --> 00:41:41,067
because a little birdie told me that
the Sheriff left the castle yesterday.

587
00:41:41,174 --> 00:41:45,293
- You're joking! Did he?
- Nice try. Get them!

588
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,077
You've got no chance.
You're going to die.

589
00:42:02,991 --> 00:42:06,062
We are going to die,
but not today!

590
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:21,536
Good to have you back.

591
00:42:25,769 --> 00:42:27,682
She's with me.

592
00:42:28,642 --> 00:42:30,673
- Good to have you back.
- Good to be back.

593
00:42:36,103 --> 00:42:38,686
I told you you were going to die.

594
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:43,944
And we said not today!
Come on, lads!

595
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:46,766
Get them. Get them.

596
00:42:48,982 --> 00:42:52,287
What are you waiting for?
They're getting away.

597
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:05,379
- To the camp?
- No time.

598
00:43:05,414 --> 00:43:06,602
There's something
I haven't told you.

599
00:43:06,637 --> 00:43:08,456
- What?
- The Sheriff has got Marian.

600
00:43:08,491 --> 00:43:10,036
- What?
- She wanted to save the King,

601
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:13,006
so she tried to kill the
Sheriff and got caught.

602
00:43:16,455 --> 00:43:19,447
Allan's right. We haven't time.
We go to the coast. Now!

603
00:43:21,407 --> 00:43:24,216
I'm coming, my love.
I'm coming.

604
00:43:48,013 --> 00:43:49,476
Sheriff?

605
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:52,678
Nasir.
My dear boy.

606
00:43:55,971 --> 00:43:57,397
Karim.

607
00:43:59,878 --> 00:44:01,605
Very good.

608
00:44:02,982 --> 00:44:05,046
Oh, very good.

609
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:06,839
What is our plan?

610
00:44:07,351 --> 00:44:10,911
You are going to visit King Richard.

611
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:17,792
- You are Saladin's new messenger.
- Saladin's royal seal.

612
00:44:18,474 --> 00:44:22,137
- Where did you get this?
- Saladin's old messenger.

613
00:44:22,172 --> 00:44:25,142
- But there is also a password.
- It was difficult getting that.

614
00:44:25,177 --> 00:44:27,099
Like pulling teeth. It was...

615
00:44:27,134 --> 00:44:30,274
- Pulling teeth!
- When we get in...

616
00:44:30,764 --> 00:44:31,754
I kill him?

617
00:44:31,789 --> 00:44:35,843
No, no, no. You won't get to within
a thousand yards ofthe King's tent.

618
00:44:36,868 --> 00:44:40,075
- I want you to lure him out.
- How?

619
00:44:40,716 --> 00:44:45,005
By telling him what he wants to hear.
Peace.

620
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:49,271
Nothing can stop us now.

621
00:44:50,366 --> 00:44:53,327
Right, lads, work to do.

622
00:44:54,214 --> 00:44:59,079
Save Marian, save
the King, save England.

623
00:45:09,317 --> 00:45:12,890
- Food. You should eat.
- Guy, listen to me.

624
00:45:12,925 --> 00:45:16,001
Now that Robin is dead, you
are the King's last chance.

625
00:45:16,036 --> 00:45:20,834
If you save him from this plot he will
reward you with position and wealth.

626
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:23,155
You'll have everything you wanted.

627
00:45:23,476 --> 00:45:26,692
Saving him from this plot?
How would that work?

628
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,351
Kill the Sheriff.

629
00:45:36,783 --> 00:45:38,719
The King will reward you.

630
00:45:38,754 --> 00:45:40,503
And...

631
00:45:43,848 --> 00:45:45,936
And I will reward you.

632
00:45:46,479 --> 00:45:48,097
How?

633
00:45:49,674 --> 00:45:51,337
If you save the King...

634
00:45:53,113 --> 00:45:55,539
I will willingly give you my hand.

635
00:45:59,092 --> 00:46:02,700
He is a Black Knight.
I would trust him with my life.

636
00:46:02,735 --> 00:46:08,404
Ah, here he is now.
Ah, how's our leper friend?

637
00:46:11,573 --> 00:46:13,094
Whingeing as usual.

638
00:46:16,137 --> 00:46:18,917
What if the King's moved on?
What if he isn't in Acre?

639
00:46:18,952 --> 00:46:21,842
Then we'll find Djaq's
uncle's friend. Bassam.

640
00:46:21,877 --> 00:46:24,454
- I'll check upstairs. Ok?
- All right.

641
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:27,031
What does Bassam do?
The pigeon handler.

642
00:46:27,066 --> 00:46:29,411
- Remember Lardner?
- The bird the Sheriff got with his buzzard?

643
00:46:29,446 --> 00:46:32,499
- That's what you think.
- We switched the pigeons.

644
00:46:32,534 --> 00:46:33,569
You're joking?!

645
00:46:34,505 --> 00:46:37,088
Nice one! So, you got the
message to the King in the end?

646
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,943
Yeah, well, no thanks to you.

647
00:46:40,409 --> 00:46:43,280
Oh, look, I've told you a thousand times.
I'm sorry boys, all right?

648
00:46:43,315 --> 00:46:46,379
- I'm back now. I'm one of the lads, let's-
- Hands up who hasn't betrayed the group.

649
00:46:47,566 --> 00:46:48,957
Oh, this one again, how clever...

650
00:46:48,992 --> 00:46:50,847
- Just leave it, Much, eh?
- Sorry.

651
00:46:50,882 --> 00:46:53,755
- We just want to find the King.
- And Marian.

652
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,304
- And Marian.
- Robin.

653
00:46:59,834 --> 00:47:01,531
I want to show you something.

654
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:07,274
See those two guards there?
Saracen soldiers.

655
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:10,425
That means this town is back
in the hands of my people.

656
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,541
The town is under curfew
and it will be dangerous.

657
00:47:13,576 --> 00:47:16,946
The bad news is your King will not be here.

658
00:47:16,981 --> 00:47:17,900
Right.

659
00:47:19,731 --> 00:47:21,963
We find your friend Bassam.

660
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:03,656
Can I ask you something?

661
00:48:04,175 --> 00:48:07,880
Being back here, in the Holy Land...

662
00:48:08,878 --> 00:48:12,368
Do you feel funny?
Cos I feel funny.

663
00:48:13,304 --> 00:48:14,944
To be the enemy again.

664
00:48:16,551 --> 00:48:18,866
If these people knew we were English...

665
00:48:19,502 --> 00:48:21,621
We have to find Marian.

666
00:48:32,897 --> 00:48:34,177
If we don't get Marian back-

667
00:48:34,212 --> 00:48:36,810
- We will find Marian...
- Robin!

668
00:48:48,267 --> 00:48:49,885
Get a grip, Marian.

669
00:48:52,109 --> 00:48:54,069
Robin's dead.

670
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:03,479
Saracens!

671
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:28,422
Three more this way!

672
00:49:42,526 --> 00:49:45,367
- Bassam's house?
- This way!

673
00:49:50,659 --> 00:49:52,202
These are Bassam's birds.

674
00:49:53,844 --> 00:49:56,372
It's as beautiful as I remember it.

675
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:01,868
- Safiya?
- Bassam!

676
00:50:04,155 --> 00:50:05,477
You're still alive!

677
00:50:06,156 --> 00:50:09,084
- So are you!
- Me? I'm always alive.

678
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:13,545
My body might fall to bits, but I'll
still have to tend to these birds.

679
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:17,159
- But you love them.
- I love you.

680
00:50:23,777 --> 00:50:26,929
When I was a little girl,
I loved these birds.

681
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:32,546
I thought that when I grew up,
I would live here and train them.

682
00:50:33,706 --> 00:50:36,867
The closest I'd ever get to flight.

683
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:40,076
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

684
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,700
Yeah, I do, actually.

685
00:50:43,012 --> 00:50:45,397
- Bismillah.
- Bismillah.

686
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,572
He speaks our language.

687
00:50:52,669 --> 00:50:55,228
Well, you speak mine.
It seems only fair.

688
00:50:57,566 --> 00:51:00,501
- I need to find our King.
- Why should I help you?

689
00:51:00,536 --> 00:51:02,573
Because his life is in danger.

690
00:51:02,608 --> 00:51:06,506
You want to save him so that he can
continue waging war against our people?

691
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:07,770
No.

692
00:51:07,805 --> 00:51:10,687
I want to take him home and make peace.

693
00:51:10,722 --> 00:51:14,648
So he can save his own people
from some very unpleasant men.

694
00:51:14,683 --> 00:51:18,702
Robin is a man of peace.
Trust him.

695
00:51:23,118 --> 00:51:24,991
Please.

696
00:51:27,328 --> 00:51:32,457
His camp is to the north.
I will show you in the morning.

697
00:51:32,492 --> 00:51:33,827
Thank you.

698
00:51:55,885 --> 00:51:57,948
<i>Yes, of course.
He can be trusted.</i>

699
00:51:57,983 --> 00:52:00,157
<i>If he says they are there,
then they are there.</i>

700
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,918
Robin Hood?
Not possible.

701
00:52:05,237 --> 00:52:07,116
Here in Acre, with his men.
Looking for the King.

702
00:52:07,151 --> 00:52:09,382
- Not a problem.
- How so?

703
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:13,039
They're still looking for him,
so they haven't found him yet.

704
00:52:13,781 --> 00:52:19,729
We're going to add a little something
extra to Saladin's message to the King.

705
00:52:20,608 --> 00:52:26,503
We're going to get
King Richard to kill Robin Hood.

706
00:52:54,455 --> 00:52:57,562
I am the envoy of his Royal
Highness Prince Saladin,

707
00:52:57,563 --> 00:53:02,256
rightful ruler of these lands.
Master of the Ayyubid dynasty.

708
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:04,886
Yeah?
And I'm the King of England.

709
00:53:21,188 --> 00:53:22,621
Thank you, Carter.

710
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,332
Keep still.

711
00:53:31,899 --> 00:53:33,380
Take him to the King's tent.

712
00:53:33,415 --> 00:53:37,796
Quartermaster, tell him three
dozen breast plates by sundown.

713
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:43,778
- Where is your King?
- I rule from the front line.

714
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:47,594
That's why your Prince
will never defeat me.

715
00:53:50,957 --> 00:53:54,849
I admire Aristotle.
I prefer Plato.

716
00:53:57,615 --> 00:54:00,159
You have the password. Speak.

717
00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:04,185
My Prince has considered
your calls for peace.

718
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:08,813
He promises nothing,
but he is prepared to talk.

719
00:54:10,165 --> 00:54:15,216
My Prince agrees to meet you,
man to man, alone in the desert.

720
00:54:15,791 --> 00:54:17,047
Where?

721
00:54:17,574 --> 00:54:18,999
Outside Emius.

722
00:54:19,408 --> 00:54:21,704
The town ruined by your Crusaders.

723
00:54:22,424 --> 00:54:24,975
- When?
- Today. Noon.

724
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:27,253
Your Majesty...
Is this wise?

725
00:54:30,173 --> 00:54:33,185
My Prince knew it, you do
not want peace.

726
00:54:34,514 --> 00:54:36,386
Wait!

727
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:38,129
I'll be there.

728
00:54:39,618 --> 00:54:42,850
My Prince offers you a gift.

729
00:54:43,754 --> 00:54:45,739
As a sign of his goodwill.

730
00:54:46,315 --> 00:54:49,659
- What gift?
- The gift of life.

731
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:55,839
Leave us.

732
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:04,248
There are men in your country
who would want to kill you.

733
00:55:04,283 --> 00:55:06,692
Tell him thank you, but I know
about the Black Knights.

734
00:55:06,727 --> 00:55:09,558
- They know you know.
- I will deal with them when I return.

735
00:55:09,593 --> 00:55:13,652
That is why they have recruited your
most loyal servant to come here.

736
00:55:13,687 --> 00:55:14,096
Who?

737
00:55:14,131 --> 00:55:17,799
He is a man that you would
trust with your life

738
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:21,765
and he travels with
a Saracen woman.

739
00:55:21,827 --> 00:55:27,817
He will offer to protect you and then,
when your guard is down...

740
00:55:29,661 --> 00:55:32,062
he will slit your throat.

741
00:55:42,791 --> 00:55:46,092
- This meeting. I'll come with you.
- No!

742
00:55:46,127 --> 00:55:49,191
Your Majesty, to meet
Saladin alone, unprotected...

743
00:55:49,226 --> 00:55:53,169
Sometimes, peace requires
more bravery than war.

744
00:55:56,552 --> 00:55:58,983
Have you thought
about what I said?

745
00:56:00,183 --> 00:56:03,196
You are a decent man, Guy.
You're not a killer.

746
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:07,008
Turn against the Sheriff.

747
00:56:08,223 --> 00:56:13,179
This is your chance.
Your last chance to be a good man.

748
00:56:23,758 --> 00:56:25,506
Good chat with Marian?

749
00:56:27,648 --> 00:56:30,176
Anything you want to tell me?

750
00:56:32,936 --> 00:56:34,504
No.

751
00:56:39,378 --> 00:56:41,441
She wants me to kill you.

752
00:56:43,836 --> 00:56:45,914
And are you going to?

753
00:56:54,949 --> 00:56:56,493
No.

754
00:56:58,036 --> 00:57:00,117
What was her suggestion?

755
00:57:00,886 --> 00:57:04,813
Oh, I would kill you,
she would vouch for me.

756
00:57:05,566 --> 00:57:07,358
The King would reward me.

757
00:57:08,054 --> 00:57:10,117
I would still win power and
I would also win-

758
00:57:10,152 --> 00:57:11,641
Marian.

759
00:57:15,758 --> 00:57:17,320
But you chose me.

760
00:57:17,673 --> 00:57:20,640
My Lord, I demonstrated my loyalty.
Now I'd like your blessing.

761
00:57:20,675 --> 00:57:23,318
- For what?
- I will still have Marian.

762
00:57:23,549 --> 00:57:27,065
When we return to England,
I will take her by force.

763
00:57:28,501 --> 00:57:31,605
Dear boy, I'll sing
at your wedding.

764
00:57:44,911 --> 00:57:48,000
There. Your King's camp.

765
00:57:52,409 --> 00:57:54,289
Shukran, Bassam.

766
00:57:59,865 --> 00:58:03,182
Does he understand
flight, the pale one?

767
00:58:03,275 --> 00:58:08,074
Who?
Yes, I think he does.

768
00:58:08,911 --> 00:58:10,872
You have my blessing.

769
00:58:16,529 --> 00:58:20,042
My name is Robin of Locksley and these
are my friends, the King's loyal subjects.

770
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:23,224
More than that. My master and
I served in his Private Guard.

771
00:58:23,259 --> 00:58:25,666
We have urgent
business with the King.

772
00:58:26,576 --> 00:58:30,576
- Saving his life, actually.
- John, look, the King's tent.

773
00:58:31,189 --> 00:58:32,654
Ut Prosim!

774
00:58:33,133 --> 00:58:35,982
- Our motto. Latin.
- What does it mean?

775
00:58:38,596 --> 00:58:41,301
That was us.
Good days.

776
00:58:41,336 --> 00:58:42,906
Well, not good.

777
00:58:42,941 --> 00:58:45,745
Death and destruction
and all that, but you know.

778
00:58:46,243 --> 00:58:48,998
- Ut prosim, lads.
- Robin!

779
00:58:49,505 --> 00:58:50,842
Carter!

780
00:58:53,228 --> 00:58:54,800
I thought you'd given up fighting?

781
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:57,424
I'm still fighting, but for peace.

782
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,119
Looks like we're finally making progress.

783
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:04,134
Robin of Locksley.

784
00:59:04,169 --> 00:59:05,911
- Your Majesty.
- Up.

785
00:59:05,946 --> 00:59:09,555
I should bow before you, friend.
Come.

786
00:59:16,483 --> 00:59:17,465
Robin.

787
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,795
Your Majesty, I bring grave news.

788
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:22,763
- You received my messages, Itrust?
- I did.

789
00:59:23,606 --> 00:59:27,178
You'll know the Sheriff of Nottingham and
the Black Knights are plotting against you.

790
00:59:27,213 --> 00:59:29,103
They are planning to
take over England.

791
00:59:29,138 --> 00:59:31,330
That's what you said.
I believe you.

792
00:59:31,365 --> 00:59:34,712
But now the Sheriff is coming
here. To find you and kill you.

793
00:59:34,747 --> 00:59:35,535
Really?

794
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:39,347
- You have to let me to protect you.
- I must allow you to protect me?

795
00:59:39,382 --> 00:59:40,491
Yes.

796
00:59:51,819 --> 00:59:55,572
- Oh, Robin. Of all people, you?
- Your Majesty?

797
00:59:55,607 --> 00:59:58,443
Of all who have served me,
you were the one I loved most.

798
00:59:58,478 --> 00:59:59,429
I cherished that.

799
00:59:59,464 --> 01:00:02,885
When I sent you home, I was sending a
piece of me and you would represent me.

800
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,223
In a small way, I think I have.

801
01:00:04,258 --> 01:00:06,789
- Robin, stop it. I know the truth.
- What truth?

802
01:00:06,824 --> 01:00:08,773
Your Majesty, you are in danger.

803
01:00:08,808 --> 01:00:10,980
Why? Have I not done right by you?

804
01:00:11,015 --> 01:00:13,506
Yes, you have... and I've
come here to save you!

805
01:00:13,541 --> 01:00:17,749
Still you deny it?
You have come here to murder your King!

806
01:00:17,784 --> 01:00:20,294
Your Majesty, no.
I can vouch for Robin.

807
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:21,747
- When I was in England...
- Quiet!

808
01:00:22,565 --> 01:00:25,278
You are a renowned marksman
with the bow, are you not?

809
01:00:25,313 --> 01:00:26,060
I am.

810
01:00:26,095 --> 01:00:29,339
Then you could have killed
my enemies a thousand times over.

811
01:00:29,374 --> 01:00:34,031
You would travel to the Holy Land instead
of aiming an arrow in Nottingham?

812
01:00:34,066 --> 01:00:35,558
Your Majesty, we couldn't just
shoot the Sheriff, we can...

813
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:37,925
- ********
- *********

814
01:00:38,596 --> 01:00:40,805
Assemble the men.

815
01:00:41,637 --> 01:00:43,604
Execute them.

816
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:49,004
- Happiness?
- Happiness.

817
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,395
He'll attend the meeting?

818
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:55,217
And watch out, watch out,
there's a Hood about?

819
01:00:57,653 --> 01:00:59,686
Come to Daddy!

820
01:01:02,095 --> 01:01:04,248
So Karim, dear boy,
you know what to do?

821
01:01:04,283 --> 01:01:08,439
What if King Richard knows
what Prince Saladin looks like?

822
01:01:08,964 --> 01:01:11,822
Well, no matter. You're not
stopping for a chat, are you?

823
01:01:19,606 --> 01:01:21,400
Gisborne.
Something I need to do...

824
01:01:21,714 --> 01:01:23,234
Go with.

825
01:01:30,932 --> 01:01:33,547
Mercy, Your Majesty!
Ut prosim!

826
01:01:33,582 --> 01:01:36,534
Your Majesty.
These people are innocent.

827
01:01:36,569 --> 01:01:39,407
If you must take a life,
take mine, spare them.

828
01:01:39,442 --> 01:01:41,799
At last. That's the Robin I remember.

829
01:01:41,834 --> 01:01:45,129
- Considering others.
- He is still the Robin you remember.

830
01:01:45,164 --> 01:01:47,737
He saved your life!
Don't you remember that?

831
01:01:55,575 --> 01:01:57,936
I cannot grant your wish.
You must all be punished.

832
01:01:57,971 --> 01:02:00,413
But you once saved my life and no,
I've not forgotten that.

833
01:02:00,448 --> 01:02:02,412
So, I'll not take yours.

834
01:02:03,003 --> 01:02:04,763
I'll let the desert decide!

835
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:10,243
The desert?
What does that mean?

836
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:12,618
Decide what?

837
01:02:14,322 --> 01:02:16,297
This is the same as execution.

838
01:02:16,818 --> 01:02:19,498
Yes. But if God wills it,
there is always a chance.

839
01:02:20,979 --> 01:02:22,803
I'll not remember you
this way, Robin.

840
01:02:23,932 --> 01:02:26,005
I'll remember you as the
hero who once saved my life.

841
01:02:26,013 --> 01:02:28,939
And I'll remember you as the
King who spent too long at war.

842
01:02:28,974 --> 01:02:30,764
It has clouded your
judgment.

843
01:02:31,466 --> 01:02:33,347
You've forgotten your people back home.

844
01:02:35,823 --> 01:02:37,259
You're right.

845
01:02:37,852 --> 01:02:39,781
It is time to stop this fighting.

846
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,100
I am meeting Saladin. Today.

847
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:45,852
I will make peace with him.
And then I will go home to England.

848
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,496
Good.

849
01:02:48,548 --> 01:02:51,390
At least my friends and
I will have achieved something.

850
01:02:52,606 --> 01:02:54,342
Goodbye.

851
01:03:01,999 --> 01:03:03,263
Good chicken.

852
01:03:03,865 --> 01:03:06,903
I owe you a debt of
gratitude, young lady.

853
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:11,883
Thanks to you,
I know that Guy is loyal.

854
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:18,380
Because if you can't turn him with
your pretty little head, then nobody can.

855
01:03:18,771 --> 01:03:22,013
Your heart must be
the coldest place on earth.

856
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:25,157
Are you a little disappointed
that he told me about your offer?

857
01:03:26,452 --> 01:03:28,384
I'm surprised
it took you so long,

858
01:03:28,385 --> 01:03:30,687
to be quite honest with you.
I was really getting rather bored.

859
01:03:30,721 --> 01:03:34,173
- Now I've served my purpose.
- You tried to kill me!

860
01:03:35,116 --> 01:03:37,339
Did you think I'm
going to let that pass?

861
01:03:37,789 --> 01:03:42,236
Robin Hood did not die in Nottingham.
Did you know this? Huh?

862
01:03:42,781 --> 01:03:43,868
Well, then.

863
01:03:44,227 --> 01:03:47,452
just as a treat, you can die together.

864
01:03:48,063 --> 01:03:49,894
This is good.

865
01:04:05,655 --> 01:04:10,000
- How long?
- In this heat... without water...

866
01:04:12,398 --> 01:04:15,358
I'm sorry, my love.
I should have made you stay with Bassam.

867
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:18,615
I would never leave you,
Will Scarlett.

868
01:04:20,914 --> 01:04:22,818
If we can just get through
the nightfall, then, you know...

869
01:04:22,853 --> 01:04:24,352
- Then what?
Then...

870
01:04:26,274 --> 01:04:29,210
- It'll be cooler.
- Cooler. It'll be freezing!

871
01:04:29,245 --> 01:04:31,656
I know, but it won't be hot.

872
01:04:31,691 --> 01:04:37,203
This heat...
Much, we do not have till nightfall.

873
01:05:16,949 --> 01:05:19,045
You know I love you all.

874
01:05:20,782 --> 01:05:23,197
john, Djaq, Will.

875
01:05:25,502 --> 01:05:27,406
Even you, Allan.

876
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:30,833
Robin.

877
01:05:32,552 --> 01:05:34,297
Master.

878
01:05:37,721 --> 01:05:40,257
When I was sewing the King,
I was sewing you.

879
01:05:42,441 --> 01:05:44,722
When I think of England, I think of you.

880
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:49,786
Marian?

881
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:55,980
Marian.

882
01:05:58,076 --> 01:05:59,621
I see something.

883
01:06:00,044 --> 01:06:02,631
I can really see
something... coming!

884
01:06:06,926 --> 01:06:09,829
- He's right.
- Help!

885
01:06:09,864 --> 01:06:11,615
- Help us...
- Help!

886
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:13,797
Help!

887
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:17,520
They've seen us.

888
01:06:17,555 --> 01:06:20,666
- God is smiling on us!
- Or Allah!

889
01:06:20,701 --> 01:06:23,166
Whichever God it is, I love him!

890
01:06:26,031 --> 01:06:28,496
It's the Sheriff.

891
01:06:29,688 --> 01:06:31,730
There is no God.

892
01:06:53,388 --> 01:06:55,683
You see, that's the trouble
with foreign travel.

893
01:06:56,630 --> 01:07:00,360
You run into all the same
people you see at home!

894
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,584
Your leper friend.

895
01:07:03,969 --> 01:07:05,984
I understand you've
met my colleague, james?

896
01:07:06,477 --> 01:07:07,690
We meet again.

897
01:07:08,578 --> 01:07:10,050
You let the Black Knights buy you?

898
01:07:10,322 --> 01:07:13,259
The pennies of the poor
put to good use! james.

899
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:15,939
You're revolting. Get off me!

900
01:07:15,974 --> 01:07:19,511
Ah, a revolt is when the people
rise up against their leader.

901
01:07:19,546 --> 01:07:23,368
Now, I'm not revolting,
I am couping.

902
01:07:23,403 --> 01:07:28,016
Plotting a sudden and
decisive change of leader.

903
01:07:28,051 --> 01:07:29,508
What about murder?

904
01:07:30,006 --> 01:07:35,025
Ah, well, if the King will
wander out into the desert alone,

905
01:07:35,626 --> 01:07:37,727
unarmed, ready to
meet his enemy...

906
01:07:37,861 --> 01:07:40,867
The King wants peace. You're killing
a man who's trying to make peace.

907
01:07:40,902 --> 01:07:44,143
Yes, and life is usually so much fairer.

908
01:07:44,178 --> 01:07:46,743
Let Marian go. She's got
nothing to do with this.

909
01:07:46,744 --> 01:07:49,459
She has everything
to do with this.

910
01:07:50,402 --> 01:07:56,375
All along, we thought we
had a spy in your camp!

911
01:07:58,245 --> 01:07:59,868
But you had one in ours.

912
01:08:01,388 --> 01:08:03,955
You see, there will always
be people who work for me,

913
01:08:04,759 --> 01:08:06,693
because I fight for justice.

914
01:08:09,551 --> 01:08:10,855
But this...

915
01:08:11,302 --> 01:08:12,983
This one is a special one.

916
01:08:14,887 --> 01:08:16,823
You were still hoping, weren't you?

917
01:08:16,858 --> 01:08:21,936
That after all this you would end up as man
and wife back home in sunny Sherwood?

918
01:08:23,012 --> 01:08:26,222
So... now you have your bride.

919
01:08:27,229 --> 01:08:30,368
I'd love to stay, but I don't tan well.

920
01:08:31,742 --> 01:08:35,247
Do excuse us, we have a King to kill.
Come along, james.

921
01:08:43,918 --> 01:08:46,136
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

922
01:08:46,171 --> 01:08:49,257
- We fought and we lost.
- But at least we will have died trying.

923
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:51,433
I want to die in England.

924
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:54,098
- In Sherwood.
- Come on, john.

925
01:08:54,133 --> 01:08:56,684
Today is a good day to die.
You're always saying it.

926
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:59,892
Today is NOT a good day to die!

927
01:09:01,373 --> 01:09:05,380
I want to die in the arms of my wife...

928
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:12,864
with my son, john, by my side...

929
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:18,495
John, you're dying for England,
even if you're not there.

930
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:23,439
Not being funny, it's the King of England
who put us here in the first place.

931
01:09:23,474 --> 01:09:25,528
The Sheriff's spun him a story!

932
01:09:26,136 --> 01:09:28,201
The moment we arrived
here we were marked men.

933
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:31,304
It's not the King's fault.

934
01:09:38,738 --> 01:09:40,763
Say the words, then, handsome.

935
01:09:41,586 --> 01:09:43,050
What words?

936
01:09:43,363 --> 01:09:47,700
I, Robin, take you, Marian.

937
01:09:50,005 --> 01:09:51,277
Now?

938
01:09:52,133 --> 01:09:53,910
Now is a good time, I think.

939
01:09:55,326 --> 01:09:59,639
We are in the company of the
best witnesses England has to offer.

940
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,457
I, Robin...

941
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:11,872
take you, Marian,
to be my lawful wedded wife.

942
01:10:12,769 --> 01:10:17,249
To have and to hold,
for better or for worse...

943
01:10:19,835 --> 01:10:23,218
for richer, or for poorer...

944
01:10:26,835 --> 01:10:28,635
In sickness...

945
01:10:29,869 --> 01:10:31,971
In sickness or in health...

946
01:10:35,541 --> 01:10:37,326
to love and to cherish...

947
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:42,566
'till death do us part.

948
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:49,993
I, Marian, take you,
Robin of Locksley,

949
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:52,685
master of the bow,

950
01:10:52,896 --> 01:10:55,512
champion of the
poor and lord of my heart,

951
01:10:56,609 --> 01:10:58,465
to be my lawful wedded husband.

952
01:11:00,265 --> 01:11:03,998
I promise to love
and to cherish you...

953
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:07,801
for better or for worse,
from this day forward,

954
01:11:09,319 --> 01:11:11,676
as long as we both shall live.

955
01:11:13,796 --> 01:11:16,741
Much, don't cry!

956
01:11:19,125 --> 01:11:21,045
He's not crying.

957
01:11:21,749 --> 01:11:23,525
He's laughing on the
wrong side of his face.

958
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:26,374
Carter!
I thought you'd left us.

959
01:11:27,204 --> 01:11:28,181
Sorry.

960
01:11:28,216 --> 01:11:29,693
Out here, you can lose your head.

961
01:11:31,045 --> 01:11:32,628
- I thought I didn't like you.
- I know.

962
01:11:35,271 --> 01:11:37,585
- I do now!
- I knew we'd find you...

963
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:39,611
We have horses.
We have weapons.

964
01:11:39,646 --> 01:11:41,933
Then we have the King to rescue.
Come on!

965
01:11:41,968 --> 01:11:44,428
- We are Robin Hood!
- What?

966
01:11:44,972 --> 01:11:48,587
- We'll explain it later.
- No! Everybody say it.

967
01:11:49,027 --> 01:11:52,074
We are Robin Hood. Say it!

968
01:11:52,109 --> 01:11:54,590
- We are Robin Hood!
- We are Robin Hood!

969
01:12:01,974 --> 01:12:03,343
The desert decided.

970
01:12:07,712 --> 01:12:10,320
Where have you been?
You nearly missed the show.

971
01:12:11,721 --> 01:12:14,298
- Delhi belly.
- Where's Marian?

972
01:12:15,387 --> 01:12:16,979
She's, er... tied up.

973
01:12:18,868 --> 01:12:21,037
This is good, this is very good.

974
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:45,976
- I am not really Saladin!
- I am not really King Richard!

975
01:12:46,011 --> 01:12:48,067
- It's Robin Hood!
- You should be dead.

976
01:12:48,102 --> 01:12:50,620
Many times over,
my friend, many times.

977
01:12:53,583 --> 01:12:54,672
Now do you believe us?

978
01:12:55,409 --> 01:12:56,818
I betrayed your loyalty.

979
01:12:58,114 --> 01:12:59,346
How can I repay you?

980
01:13:00,248 --> 01:13:03,665
Actually...
I know this is not the time,

981
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:06,689
Your Majesty, but there is a little
place in Nottingham called Bonchurch...

982
01:13:07,228 --> 01:13:08,689
Much!

983
01:13:09,348 --> 01:13:11,020
Sorry, forget about it.

984
01:13:18,294 --> 01:13:19,559
He needs us.

985
01:13:27,864 --> 01:13:29,487
Marian!

986
01:13:36,757 --> 01:13:39,521
- Robin. Forgive me.
- I already have.

987
01:13:42,427 --> 01:13:45,547
Let's finish this now. After them!

988
01:14:03,793 --> 01:14:06,677
It's not too late, we can still get the
King. You two, over there.

989
01:14:06,712 --> 01:14:08,601
Gisborne with me.

990
01:14:23,387 --> 01:14:24,484
This is a trap.

991
01:14:25,587 --> 01:14:27,778
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

992
01:14:28,778 --> 01:14:30,617
- Where's the King?
- Went after the Sheriff.

993
01:14:30,652 --> 01:14:32,465
We need to get him
out of here now!

994
01:14:43,898 --> 01:14:45,076
Keep them pinned down.

995
01:14:45,494 --> 01:14:46,883
I'll go round the back.

996
01:14:49,598 --> 01:14:51,276
Quickly. You must get out of here.

997
01:14:51,918 --> 01:14:53,197
Leave them to me.

998
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:05,575
This is not right. Split up.

999
01:15:21,398 --> 01:15:23,030
Come on.

1000
01:15:45,825 --> 01:15:47,498
Long live the King!

1001
01:15:48,746 --> 01:15:50,129
No.

1002
01:16:08,456 --> 01:16:10,189
Bye-bye, Blondie.

1003
01:16:13,085 --> 01:16:14,613
We meet again!

1004
01:16:25,266 --> 01:16:27,077
Guy!

1005
01:16:32,335 --> 01:16:33,800
Stop!

1006
01:16:34,247 --> 01:16:36,646
- It's over, Guy!
- Get out of the way.

1007
01:16:36,681 --> 01:16:38,697
All this time, I've
been fighting for England.

1008
01:16:38,732 --> 01:16:41,160
You think I'm going
to let you kill England?

1009
01:16:41,161 --> 01:16:44,950
- Marian, get out of the way!
- You'll have to kill me first.

1010
01:16:44,985 --> 01:16:47,692
No, we're going to get out of this.

1011
01:16:47,727 --> 01:16:49,179
I'm going to do this thing.

1012
01:16:49,214 --> 01:16:53,190
And then I will have power beyond measure.
And we will be together.

1013
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:59,376
I would rather die than
be with you, Guy of Gisborne.

1014
01:17:02,927 --> 01:17:05,579
I'm going to marry Robin Hood.

1015
01:17:09,227 --> 01:17:11,020
I love Robin Hood.

1016
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:18,382
I love Robin Hood.

1017
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:33,569
Marian!

1018
01:17:42,922 --> 01:17:44,876
No!

1019
01:17:54,124 --> 01:17:56,279
Gisborne!

1020
01:17:57,366 --> 01:17:59,689
It's not over, Hood!

1021
01:18:02,128 --> 01:18:05,262
I will have England!

1022
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:21,147
The King? Where's the King?

1023
01:18:21,182 --> 01:18:24,385
He's all right. Marian, he's
all right. You saved him.

1024
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:26,252
How's it looking down there?

1025
01:18:27,141 --> 01:18:29,493
Am I beyond even Djaq's amazing talent?

1026
01:18:29,528 --> 01:18:31,016
Hang on. We'll think of something.

1027
01:18:31,051 --> 01:18:34,150
Well, can you at least get
this out of me. It hurts...

1028
01:18:36,308 --> 01:18:39,854
Marian. Marian, we can't
take it out just yet.

1029
01:18:39,889 --> 01:18:43,031
Why? Why?

1030
01:18:48,007 --> 01:18:50,255
Will I die when it comes out?

1031
01:18:58,425 --> 01:19:00,198
Then we haven't got much time, my darling.

1032
01:19:00,233 --> 01:19:03,127
We have for ever, my love.

1033
01:19:03,534 --> 01:19:07,847
I hope we have for ever in heaven
because we didn't have enough time on earth.

1034
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:10,344
Not nearly enough time.

1035
01:19:11,041 --> 01:19:14,032
- We were busy.
- We were fighters and I am proud.

1036
01:19:14,702 --> 01:19:18,974
- You keep fighting for me, Robin.
- I can't fight without you.

1037
01:19:19,009 --> 01:19:22,274
I'd love to argue with you,
but we haven't got the time.

1038
01:19:22,966 --> 01:19:25,934
You promise me, you keep fighting.

1039
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:28,879
I will.

1040
01:19:33,471 --> 01:19:34,970
Now, where were we?

1041
01:19:35,866 --> 01:19:37,481
What?

1042
01:19:37,953 --> 01:19:41,361
The last time we were dying,
we were getting married.

1043
01:19:41,987 --> 01:19:43,714
Can we carry on, please?

1044
01:19:44,409 --> 01:19:46,035
I can't remember.

1045
01:19:46,762 --> 01:19:49,661
That's the last time I marry
you, if you can't remember!

1046
01:19:49,696 --> 01:19:51,232
Robin.

1047
01:20:02,858 --> 01:20:06,938
I, Robin, take you, Marian,
to be my wedded wife.

1048
01:20:07,402 --> 01:20:09,442
To have and to hold,
from this day forward,

1049
01:20:10,538 --> 01:20:15,100
for better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer,

1050
01:20:16,029 --> 01:20:18,241
in sickness or in health,

1051
01:20:18,903 --> 01:20:23,870
to love and to cherish,
'till death do us part.

1052
01:20:25,294 --> 01:20:28,554
I, Marian, take you, Robin,

1053
01:20:29,406 --> 01:20:34,175
beautiful, beautiful lord of Locksley,
to be my wedded husband.

1054
01:20:35,303 --> 01:20:38,615
I promise to love you
and to cherish you,

1055
01:20:38,882 --> 01:20:42,865
on earth and
especially in heaven...

1056
01:20:45,617 --> 01:20:47,394
for now and forever.

1057
01:20:47,881 --> 01:20:50,154
Till death do us part.

1058
01:20:52,403 --> 01:20:54,243
Kiss me.

1059
01:20:54,882 --> 01:20:56,314
No.

1060
01:20:56,866 --> 01:20:59,115
Give me the ring first.

1061
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:01,980
Make an honest woman of me, Robin.

1062
01:21:06,579 --> 01:21:09,541
You may kiss the bride.

1063
01:21:12,944 --> 01:21:18,549
- I love you, my husband.
- I love you, my wife.

1064
01:21:32,915 --> 01:21:35,371
That's better.

1065
01:21:42,909 --> 01:21:45,221
Marian?

1066
01:21:50,219 --> 01:21:52,172
Marian?

1067
01:23:36,197 --> 01:23:37,981
You take care.

1068
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,318
Robin.

1069
01:23:45,952 --> 01:23:47,592
Will and I are...

1070
01:23:50,617 --> 01:23:52,224
You're staying.

1071
01:23:53,481 --> 01:23:55,419
Ma salama, Robin.

1072
01:24:06,668 --> 01:24:10,620
- Come here. Look after her.
- Thank you.

1073
01:24:21,196 --> 01:24:22,846
Robin.

1074
01:24:42,343 --> 01:24:44,226
You've saved my life.

1075
01:24:47,145 --> 01:24:48,640
Now go home and grieve your loss.

1076
01:24:48,675 --> 01:24:53,814
Now, Your Majesty, for every man there
is a purpose which he sets up in his life.

1077
01:24:55,911 --> 01:24:58,504
Let yours be the doing of all good deeds.

1078
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,687
The Koran.

1079
01:25:03,976 --> 01:25:05,791
Then do those deeds in my name.

1080
01:25:06,096 --> 01:25:10,733
You are my representatives in England.
You are King Richard.

1081
01:25:12,632 --> 01:25:14,344
- And you?
- Us?

1082
01:25:14,799 --> 01:25:17,241
We are Robin Hood!

1083
01:25:18,049 --> 01:25:19,250
Yes.

1084
01:25:19,665 --> 01:25:22,631
- We are Robin Hood!
- We are Robin Hood!

1085
01:25:24,634 --> 01:25:26,010
Come on, lads.

1086
01:25:27,324 --> 01:25:29,556
Let's go home.

1087
01:25:53,993 --> 01:25:59,974
