1
00:00:12,807 --> 00:00:14,400
The Pact! The Pact!

2
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,432
The Pact!

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,600
The Pact!

4
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:29,159
The Pact!

5
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,840
The Pact!

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,000
The Pact! The Pact!

7
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:50,359
Noooooo!

8
00:00:57,248 --> 00:00:59,615
Morning, my Lord. Sorry to disturb you.

9
00:01:00,715 --> 00:01:01,910
Who are you?

10
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:07,440
- Where's the Sheriff?
- I was about to ask the same question.

11
00:01:08,522 --> 00:01:10,520
- Get out!
- Uh-uh-uh. You hurt me,

12
00:01:11,807 --> 00:01:13,086
hurt Prince John.

13
00:01:13,925 --> 00:01:15,360
I'm his special envoy.

14
00:01:16,345 --> 00:01:20,089
- Well, I've never seen you before.
- That's because I arrive at dawn,

15
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:21,400
every other Thursday,

16
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:24,269
share a glass of wine with the Sheriff,

17
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:26,496
he stamps his seal here,

18
00:01:26,925 --> 00:01:29,455
I take it to Prince John
and the Prince knows

19
00:01:29,575 --> 00:01:32,402
that all is well in the provinces.
But today...

20
00:01:33,788 --> 00:01:35,989
all is not well, is it?

21
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:38,800
No Sheriff, no stamp...

22
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:43,712
and of course, you have no idea
what's happened to him.

23
00:01:44,315 --> 00:01:47,000
- No.
- Well, then I suggest you find out.

24
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,856
You know the deal.
Anything happens to the Sheriff,

25
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,600
Prince John sends an army to
raze Nottingham to the ground.

26
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,718
We don't know if anything
has happened to him.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,188
But he's not here!

28
00:01:57,003 --> 00:01:58,672
That's all I need to know.

29
00:01:59,492 --> 00:02:01,859
The troops will be here by sunset.

30
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,758
I've already sent the signal.

31
00:02:03,878 --> 00:02:06,480
Nottingham is about to be flattened.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,920
Moochie
Sub Wood Team

33
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:06,880
I've been watching you.

34
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:10,572
- You've been sleepwalking.
- What?

35
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,910
- Nice silk.
- I am the Sheriff of Nottingham.

36
00:03:16,311 --> 00:03:17,969
I do not sleepwalk

37
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,584
and YOU will take me to Nottingham.

38
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,400
Maybe we should start again.

39
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:31,440
What a pretty mouth you've got.

40
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:57,313
And so... to Nottingham.

41
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,429
Allan?

42
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,402
Where are ya?

43
00:04:10,256 --> 00:04:11,664
Organise the guard.

44
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:15,880
The Sheriff's missing.
Search every inch of the castle.

45
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:17,600
- Find him.
- Missing?

46
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,582
Find him!

47
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:32,325
I want the sun and I want it now!

48
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,560
Well, you can't always
get what you want, can ya?

49
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:44,839
- This stable lass saw him go at night.
- Go? Where?

50
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:45,862
Go on.

51
00:04:47,128 --> 00:04:48,905
He went out on his horse.

52
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:51,761
He was... mumbling.

53
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:55,520
- Mumbling?
- Just tell him what you told me.

54
00:04:58,158 --> 00:05:00,280
He said, "Open the gate."

55
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:06,538
And what did you do?

56
00:05:08,721 --> 00:05:09,920
I opened the gate.

57
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,898
He was in his nightclothes, sir.

58
00:05:15,018 --> 00:05:18,360
Comb the whole town, then get out
to all the villages. Just find him!

59
00:05:25,123 --> 00:05:28,173
Well, I see our kitchen
is taking good care of you.

60
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,360
Good food is wasted on me.

61
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:32,666
But I can smell a rat.

62
00:05:32,926 --> 00:05:34,333
What have you done to him?

63
00:05:34,453 --> 00:05:36,920
Sir Jasper, nothing has been done
with the Sheriff.

64
00:05:37,197 --> 00:05:38,169
In fact,

65
00:05:38,846 --> 00:05:42,129
he was seen riding out of the castle
last night alive and well.

66
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:44,633
- We have a witness.
- Don't want a witness.

67
00:05:44,753 --> 00:05:46,180
I want the Sheriff.

68
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:47,479
Now,

69
00:05:48,403 --> 00:05:49,805
what's for pudding?

70
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,503
Your patch? Don't be so ridiculous!

71
00:05:52,623 --> 00:05:54,283
This is the King's forest.

72
00:05:54,403 --> 00:05:56,742
We're working this patch, now clear off!

73
00:05:56,862 --> 00:05:59,038
You've never done
a day's work in your life!

74
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,977
Find your own sucker,
cos Robin Hood's ours!

75
00:06:02,412 --> 00:06:04,542
Robin Hood? Robin Hood comes here?

76
00:06:04,915 --> 00:06:07,960
Like you don't know it's
a drop point. Now go on!

77
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,258
- Sling your hook!
- Very well,

78
00:06:10,378 --> 00:06:12,379
a drop point. Off I shall sling.

79
00:06:12,626 --> 00:06:15,087
Oh, this is good. This is very good.

80
00:06:27,332 --> 00:06:28,118
Right.

81
00:06:29,584 --> 00:06:32,699
He's not been seen in Locksley,
Nettlestone or Clun.

82
00:06:33,632 --> 00:06:36,604
There's reports of troop movements,
heading this way on the North Road.

83
00:06:36,724 --> 00:06:37,520
Noooo!

84
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,720
- I heard about the Sheriff. Any news?
- Nothing.

85
00:06:41,498 --> 00:06:42,577
What do you think?

86
00:06:42,697 --> 00:06:45,699
If he hadn't left on his own accord,
I would think this was Hood's work.

87
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:49,145
No, no, no. Hood knows the arrangement
between the Sheriff and Prince John.

88
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,560
He wouldn't let Nottingham be destroyed.

89
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:55,560
On this occasion I don't
think Hood is the problem,

90
00:06:56,641 --> 00:06:58,878
- but he might be the solution.
- How?

91
00:06:59,538 --> 00:07:03,120
Robin knows Nottingham and
the forest better than any man alive.

92
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,733
- If the Sheriff's out there...
- He's not going to help us.

93
00:07:05,853 --> 00:07:09,560
- Well, have you asked him?
- We do not deal with outlaws.

94
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,898
This could be our only hope.

95
00:07:12,018 --> 00:07:15,000
If I could get a message to him,
if I could bring him here to the...

96
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:19,000
To the castle...

97
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,775
You could bring Hood here to the castle?

98
00:07:28,144 --> 00:07:29,160
I think so.

99
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,778
He will not want Nottingham
razed to the ground. Same as you.

100
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,189
Very well.

101
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,360
Do it.

102
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:54,239
A good morning's work, lads. Well done.

103
00:07:58,093 --> 00:07:59,963
What have you got there, John?

104
00:08:02,771 --> 00:08:04,040
It lays golden eggs.

105
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,520
And tomorrow,

106
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:09,731
there's a consignment
of magic beans coming in.

107
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,724
John,

108
00:08:14,606 --> 00:08:17,480
- I think we need to have a little...
- Oh, give me strength!

109
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,237
This is the booty, here!

110
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,556
This is for the kitchen.

111
00:08:24,313 --> 00:08:27,000
Oh, could have done
with some magic beans!

112
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:32,599
Well, I'm glad to see
someone's laughing. I'm on my own!

113
00:08:33,602 --> 00:08:34,440
Honest!

114
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,320
What do you want?

115
00:08:37,652 --> 00:08:41,368
Marian said to show you this and
you'll know I'm telling the truth.

116
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,156
All right?

117
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,811
She needs your help. Just for today,
you've got safe passage into the castle.

118
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,360
You don't expect us to believe that?

119
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,600
- Why?
- They've lost the Sheriff.

120
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,800
If we don't find him today an army
is coming to destroy Nottingham.

121
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:04,280
We're leaving. Now.

122
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:09,300
We drop everything on the say-so
of a traitor to go and help our enemy?

123
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,634
John, I gave Marian this ring.

124
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,800
She wouldn't lie to me.

125
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:16,140
Come on.

126
00:09:24,015 --> 00:09:25,127
Put it down!

127
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,257
Wait there.

128
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:39,935
Open the gates!

129
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:48,600
This is weird, I don't like it.

130
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:56,080
Can't you just sneak in anyway?

131
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,319
After this, we go back,
we help the poor?

132
00:09:58,607 --> 00:09:59,755
Yes, John.

133
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,372
There are people waiting,
we have four drop-offs today.

134
00:10:04,492 --> 00:10:06,086
They're relying on us.

135
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:11,320
All right.

136
00:10:13,984 --> 00:10:15,250
Take these, Much.

137
00:10:36,284 --> 00:10:37,000
Well!

138
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,920
You're a bigger man
than I thought, Gisborne.

139
00:10:41,195 --> 00:10:43,880
Asking your enemy for help
in a time of crisis.

140
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,520
It's your crisis as well, Hood.

141
00:10:46,096 --> 00:10:49,717
You know what Prince John will do
if anything happens to the Sheriff.

142
00:10:51,556 --> 00:10:54,147
- Have you searched the castle?
- Of course we did.

143
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:56,953
He was seen leaving last night,
on horseback...

144
00:10:57,606 --> 00:10:59,302
in his nightclothes.

145
00:11:00,262 --> 00:11:01,960
Shock troops will be here by sundown.

146
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,440
Nottingham and everything in it
will be destroyed.

147
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:07,449
If anyone can find him, it's you.

148
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,397
You have people everywhere.

149
00:11:21,862 --> 00:11:22,909
Go on then.

150
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:24,870
Ask.

151
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,819
- What?
- Ask me for my help.

152
00:11:32,236 --> 00:11:33,644
- Robin...
- Him.

153
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,640
We're wasting our time.

154
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,378
- Will you help us find the Sheriff?
- Of course I will.

155
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:51,325
Why else do you think I came?

156
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,668
Shoes... My kingdom for some shoes...

157
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,880
Whoo, a change of clothes.

158
00:12:06,402 --> 00:12:07,266
My man!

159
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,732
My, er, my dear fellow...

160
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:20,619
You, er, you do realise that those
clothes are worth at least?

161
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:23,840
Yeah, sure,
and I'm the Sheriff of Nottingham.

162
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:30,687
- So?
- We have to find him.

163
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,200
You and I will track him.

164
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,800
Take one, take one.

165
00:12:35,725 --> 00:12:39,227
Will, I want you to wait in the town,
search every street, ask around.

166
00:12:39,347 --> 00:12:40,640
Djaq, John...

167
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,920
- John?!
- Every day, more beggars.

168
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,721
- John, you need to focus.
- Are we making any difference to them?

169
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,599
Robin, you can't just
throw money at them!

170
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:56,284
Today we're trying
to save everybody's life!

171
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:58,688
The Sheriff may be in the forest.

172
00:12:58,808 --> 00:13:02,032
I want you and Djaq to go there,
check all the regular drop points.

173
00:13:02,152 --> 00:13:04,257
Somebody may have seen something.

174
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,364
Will?

175
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:10,164
I don't know how today is going to end.

176
00:13:10,284 --> 00:13:12,914
But whatever happens,
you need to look after Marian.

177
00:13:13,034 --> 00:13:15,039
- Of course...
- Will, I'm relying on you,

178
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:18,080
she has to live,
even if no-one else does.

179
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:37,999
You do know Hood robs from the rich...

180
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,212
- We told you to clear off!
- To give to the poor?

181
00:13:41,332 --> 00:13:45,182
- What do you think we're doing here?
- Living off scraps, my dear.

182
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:47,680
Think about it.

183
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,130
He robs from the rich.

184
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,524
He must have a huge stash somewhere.

185
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:59,200
And what does he give you?
A handful of scraps? Tut-tut-tut...

186
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,360
Don't talk rubbish.

187
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,720
If you upped your game,

188
00:14:04,442 --> 00:14:07,410
then you could get inside Hood's
secret camp and...

189
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,240
who knows what you might find there?

190
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:16,611
Now, with a little tuition from me...

191
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,760
Hey, we rob fools for a living.

192
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,445
Oh, so do I.

193
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,417
So do I...

194
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,273
How does, um,

195
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:26,866
Robin Hood's

196
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:29,760
secret treasure interest you?

197
00:14:31,221 --> 00:14:32,026
Yeah?

198
00:14:32,774 --> 00:14:34,280
And your cut's the lion's share?

199
00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:37,806
No, no, no... I don't want any of it.

200
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:39,920
You can have it all, have it all.

201
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,975
I'm only interested in a teeny weeny

202
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:45,778
bit of paper that belongs to me.

203
00:14:47,238 --> 00:14:49,385
- Who are you?
- I am the...

204
00:14:49,738 --> 00:14:51,037
man with the plan.

205
00:14:53,648 --> 00:14:54,348
So,

206
00:14:56,013 --> 00:14:57,705
shall we begin the lesson?

207
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,781
Search the houses, one each.

208
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,000
They're looking everywhere. They're even
dredging the ponds. He's just nowhere.

209
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,467
- Keep searching.
- Right.

210
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,217
Ah, it's good, this.

211
00:15:35,912 --> 00:15:37,877
You and me, back on a mission.

212
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:40,520
I mean, no offence
against the others, but...

213
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:43,000
it's like the good old days,

214
00:15:43,514 --> 00:15:45,076
back in the Holy Land...

215
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,031
Look,

216
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,017
these shoes.

217
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,409
They were definitely made by the
Sheriff's smithy, weren't they?

218
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:55,439
- That's him.
- Come on.

219
00:15:57,295 --> 00:16:00,396
Master, you know that ring,
the one Marian gave you...?

220
00:16:01,908 --> 00:16:03,878
- Is it a new code?
- No...

221
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,725
I gave it to her
when we were in the tree.

222
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:12,760
What, you giving jewellery?
That must've surprised her.

223
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,683
She probably thought you were
going to propose.

224
00:16:15,986 --> 00:16:17,264
Yeah, I did.

225
00:16:20,442 --> 00:16:21,760
And she said yes.

226
00:16:25,787 --> 00:16:28,899
Well, this is when you're supposed
to say "congratula..."

227
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,280
Congratulations!

228
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,133
- She said yes?
- She did.

229
00:16:39,234 --> 00:16:40,856
That's incredible.

230
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:45,045
Only if we live to enjoy it.

231
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,924
Come on... He went this way, come on.

232
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:58,147
It's not enough just to be poor...

233
00:16:59,303 --> 00:17:01,440
- and dirty.
- I can do old.

234
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,472
- Works every time with the nuns.
- Yes, not bad, but you see, come here,

235
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:10,400
you really need something
that makes you stand out,

236
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,397
- really stand out from the poor crowd.
- We could be sick as well.

237
00:17:14,517 --> 00:17:17,547
- Better, better...
- We can do foaming at the mouth.

238
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:19,376
Oh, and deathly pallor.

239
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:21,640
Oh, yes,

240
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,720
the poor distraught mother desperately
trying to protect her dying brood.

241
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:28,048
Excellent, excellent!

242
00:17:28,168 --> 00:17:32,120
Eat the lot.
But you see, not just old and weak.

243
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,280
But... Ah! He's blind,
he's blind and all!

244
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:41,017
Thank you very much, you're too kind,

245
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:43,320
but what we need is a clincher.

246
00:17:44,221 --> 00:17:47,748
Now, what would make Robin Hood's
bleeding heart really gush?

247
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,160
For a big enough haul, I could always
chop one of the kid's arms off.

248
00:17:54,913 --> 00:17:57,694
I like your thinking,
very good, but, erm, no.

249
00:17:58,519 --> 00:17:59,892
I've a better idea.

250
00:18:01,931 --> 00:18:04,481
- It's not enough.
- That's all there is.

251
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,796
- Not enough for all the villagers.
- Families with young children first.

252
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:12,074
No, we need more food. No.
We need to find the Sheriff.

253
00:18:12,414 --> 00:18:15,003
- I don't care about the Sheriff.
- All right,

254
00:18:15,123 --> 00:18:17,305
then you don't care about Nottingham.

255
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:19,400
- That's not what I meant.
- John.

256
00:18:20,252 --> 00:18:23,560
If the Sheriff isn't found,
Nottingham will be destroyed.

257
00:18:26,081 --> 00:18:28,959
Everyone, everyone else is
out looking for the Sheriff.

258
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:31,160
Yes. And that's what
we should be doing too.

259
00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:34,889
I can't let people starve.

260
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:37,633
- And I won't go against Robin's orders.
- Why?

261
00:18:37,753 --> 00:18:39,360
Because he's right.

262
00:18:40,563 --> 00:18:41,680
And he's our leader.

263
00:18:45,427 --> 00:18:46,848
Leaders can be wrong.

264
00:18:53,157 --> 00:18:54,364
Sir Jasper...

265
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,675
I think that we can come
to some sort of understanding.

266
00:18:58,836 --> 00:19:02,339
I know that you're only acting in the
Sheriff's best interests and so are we.

267
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:04,702
You're not doing a very good job of it.

268
00:19:05,104 --> 00:19:08,918
The truth is that we just don't know
where he is. And we need more time.

269
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:12,008
Look, rules are rules. If I make
an exception, the next thing,

270
00:19:12,128 --> 00:19:14,015
every other ambitious young captain

271
00:19:14,135 --> 00:19:16,533
is murdering his sheriff
thinking he can get away with it.

272
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:19,289
- I've not murdered him, I assure you.
- Well...

273
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:24,586
I could make you a very rich man.

274
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,399
Look, if Nottingham or Derby

275
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:32,039
or any other town
under Prince John's protection

276
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:34,880
gets razed to the ground,
it has to be rebuilt.

277
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,838
And it so happens that the Royal
Charter for Reconstruction

278
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,247
has been licensed to my cousin.

279
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,622
Did you think I was going to be a
glorified messenger all my life?

280
00:19:50,966 --> 00:19:52,960
- You really are going to do this?
- Oh, yes,

281
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,514
come sunset,
no Sheriff, no Nottingham.

282
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,600
It always amazes me
how much dust an army kicks up.

283
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,221
But then it's a very big army.

284
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,229
- Three more drops.
- Yes,

285
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,720
one here and two more before the river.

286
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,575
Someone must have seen
the Sheriff by now.

287
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,108
Oh, my baby!

288
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,044
- Dear God...
- Oh, my baby!

289
00:20:42,112 --> 00:20:43,319
Oh, my baby!

290
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:47,274
No-one...

291
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,440
No-one should be reduced to this.

292
00:20:50,971 --> 00:20:54,935
By the looks of them, that is not
the last grave they'll dig.

293
00:20:57,196 --> 00:20:58,628
Not if I can help it.

294
00:21:03,258 --> 00:21:04,514
Oh, my baby!

295
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:13,039
Do not be alarmed, no-one will hurt you.

296
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:21,513
- We're with Robin Hood.
- Oh, God bless ya.

297
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:25,166
- God bless ya.
- Why didn't he take me

298
00:21:25,486 --> 00:21:27,971
instead of my only grandchild...?

299
00:21:29,942 --> 00:21:31,918
We must stay here and help them.

300
00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:34,920
- John, we have a mission.
- THEY are our mission.

301
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,800
- Robin has asked us...
- Robin is not here! We are.

302
00:21:41,732 --> 00:21:43,880
These people need our help.

303
00:21:49,944 --> 00:21:52,867
- Jasper will not be swayed.
- There's still time.

304
00:21:53,476 --> 00:21:55,480
- There's time for you to get away.
- No.

305
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,457
You did not run
when I was being held hostage.

306
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:01,985
I'm not leaving you in trouble.

307
00:22:07,515 --> 00:22:08,639
Well, then...

308
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:12,195
we must prepare to defend ourselves.

309
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,722
Search all of the villages,
just find him. Go. Ask around.

310
00:22:33,772 --> 00:22:36,200
I don't think we're going
to get out of this, Will.

311
00:22:42,524 --> 00:22:44,180
But if we do, do you...?

312
00:22:45,473 --> 00:22:48,075
Do you reckon I could
come back to the lads?

313
00:22:48,938 --> 00:22:51,899
You're too late, Allan.
Miles too late.

314
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,445
- I've made a few mistakes, but...
- Mistakes?!

315
00:22:54,565 --> 00:22:56,319
You deliberately betrayed us!

316
00:22:57,574 --> 00:22:59,121
Strictly speaking, that's true.

317
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,491
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

318
00:23:01,138 --> 00:23:02,938
But it's not that simple,
Will, all right?

319
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:06,320
I never told Gisborne where the camp is.
I saved your life, didn't I?

320
00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:10,463
Well? I know a lot of about
how this place works now.

321
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,946
That's gonna help Robin, right?

322
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,059
Come on. What do you reckon?
The old team, back together?

323
00:23:18,518 --> 00:23:20,281
You're with Gisborne now.

324
00:23:21,511 --> 00:23:23,240
There's no coming back from there.

325
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,784
I'm getting used to it,
life as an heroic outlaw.

326
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:34,122
The King will come back,

327
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,173
you and Marian will be married
living in some grand old mansion.

328
00:23:38,805 --> 00:23:40,560
- And I'll just...
- Well, well well.

329
00:23:44,316 --> 00:23:45,784
Look at these marks.

330
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,177
They carry on this way, come on.

331
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:53,184
- I mean, it's all going to end.
- Tell it to the sun, Much!

332
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,960
Look, it's racing across the sky

333
00:23:56,513 --> 00:23:59,973
and if we don't find the Sheriff
before sundown, everything will end.

334
00:24:00,093 --> 00:24:02,176
Me, you, Marian, everything!

335
00:24:03,353 --> 00:24:05,933
There'll be nothing
left but scorched earth.

336
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:11,440
Oh! It's so cold.

337
00:24:12,214 --> 00:24:13,142
So cold.

338
00:24:13,262 --> 00:24:15,460
I've got some medicines
back at camp.

339
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:16,880
No.

340
00:24:20,035 --> 00:24:23,600
- We take them with us.
- The camp is secret.

341
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:28,157
Look at them!

342
00:24:28,861 --> 00:24:32,160
Do you really think it's a good idea
to leave them out here? Truthfully?

343
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,505
The old man won't know.
The rest we blindfold.

344
00:24:42,378 --> 00:24:45,447
- Can I just have a word?
- I assume you're talking to me.

345
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,419
Sorry, Sir Jasper,
if you've got a moment.

346
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:48,302
Go on.

347
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,219
Between you and me, Guy is not
very good at talking himself up.

348
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:54,544
I want you know to know
we're doing everything we can,

349
00:24:54,664 --> 00:24:57,007
- even if he's not showing it.
- Good.

350
00:24:57,383 --> 00:25:00,524
There's not a long of men would
do what Guy's doing right now.

351
00:25:00,644 --> 00:25:03,475
You should keep him in mind for other
things. He could be very useful

352
00:25:03,595 --> 00:25:06,722
- in another county.
- What? Him and YOU?

353
00:25:08,564 --> 00:25:10,304
Well, yeah, I suppose so.

354
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,986
It's interesting, isn't it, when people
realise that they're going to die,

355
00:25:14,106 --> 00:25:17,569
suddenly all this new-found loyalty
creeps out of the woodwork?

356
00:25:18,853 --> 00:25:20,296
- I want to live.
- Allan...

357
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:22,265
You'd better find the Sheriff then.

358
00:25:22,385 --> 00:25:25,535
I thought I gave you a job to do.
You did. I'm on it.

359
00:25:27,453 --> 00:25:29,120
Your boy really wants to save you.

360
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,714
This isn't about me, but about
the people of Nottingham.

361
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:35,778
Correct. And much as I dislike you,
you need not fear the onslaught.

362
00:25:36,649 --> 00:25:40,424
As a Black Knight, you and your family
may pass freely through the town.

363
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:43,480
- I have no family.
- Good. Keeps things simple.

364
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:46,678
But I do have friends.

365
00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:49,715
- Family. Not friends.
- One person in particular.

366
00:25:49,995 --> 00:25:52,598
- Oh, a particular Lady Marian?
- Yes.

367
00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:55,603
We were once engaged and I have
reason to hope that, in time...

368
00:25:55,723 --> 00:25:59,183
Wait, wait, wait. "Reason to hope"?
Doesn't really wash.

369
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:02,960
- In time, she will be family.
- In time?

370
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,200
- Yes. In time she will be my wife.
- Not if she's dead.

371
00:26:08,171 --> 00:26:10,160
- Marian comes with me.
- Yes.

372
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,240
If you've married her by then.

373
00:26:12,835 --> 00:26:14,880
I can't marry her between
now and sunset, can I?!

374
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,367
Why not? She's hardly
going to say no, is she?

375
00:26:41,586 --> 00:26:43,302
Sir Jasper, Sir Jasper?

376
00:26:43,422 --> 00:26:46,384
The time for talking is over.
I have to brief my troops.

377
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,667
- At least let us evacuate the town!
- No.

378
00:26:48,787 --> 00:26:50,663
Spare the women and children, please...

379
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:52,140
An example has to be set.

380
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,958
As Prince John always says,
the best examples are written in blood.

381
00:26:57,842 --> 00:26:58,871
How many?

382
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:02,761
They're surrounding the whole town.
It's going to take a lot to do that.

383
00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:19,496
Get all of our guards
into siege positions.

384
00:27:19,617 --> 00:27:21,771
What guards? They're out
looking for the Sheriff.

385
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,965
Get every able-bodied man
into the armoury.

386
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:25,818
Do you trust this lot with weapons?

387
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:28,428
We're fighting for our lives now.
All of us.

388
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,320
- Hang on...
- Just do it!

389
00:27:31,481 --> 00:27:32,240
Right.

390
00:27:39,854 --> 00:27:40,979
Here we are.

391
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,440
Try to get some rest.
We'll bring food and medicine.

392
00:27:49,523 --> 00:27:51,038
The promised land.

393
00:27:57,689 --> 00:27:59,301
- Help me...
- I'm coming.

394
00:27:59,421 --> 00:28:01,621
- Help me.
- This way, I'm here now.

395
00:28:01,741 --> 00:28:04,267
- Help me...
- Just straight on. Straight on.

396
00:28:04,387 --> 00:28:08,017
- A little bit of cheese...
- We'll give you a little wash first.

397
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,947
- Where's Marian?
- Will.

398
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:29,280
Looks like we're
brothers in arms again after all.

399
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,159
Not exactly what I had in mind.

400
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,360
Will! Any word from Robin?

401
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,760
But I know he will die
before he stops looking.

402
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:50,911
- Today that's not good enough, Will.
- Marian...

403
00:28:51,165 --> 00:28:53,571
one person who can't die is you.

404
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:57,536
- There's no way out.
- I promised Robin you'd be safe.

405
00:29:09,858 --> 00:29:11,287
Where is he going?

406
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,254
You know, I was thinking,
I might stay here

407
00:29:14,374 --> 00:29:16,633
when you and Marian are, you know...

408
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:18,516
Much. Look.

409
00:29:19,178 --> 00:29:20,815
I think we're going in on him.

410
00:29:20,935 --> 00:29:22,627
These are fresh footprints.

411
00:29:24,736 --> 00:29:26,500
Or I could be a lone outlaw.

412
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:30,500
The Sherwood Avenger...

413
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:32,608
Much, come here.

414
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,162
Yes! Only one man in Nottingham
has nightclothes like that!

415
00:29:46,905 --> 00:29:50,840
I don't believe it.
Where did you get those clothes?

416
00:29:51,443 --> 00:29:54,160
I traded them, fair and square.
For some good rags.

417
00:29:54,704 --> 00:29:57,377
You traded rags for silk pyjamas?

418
00:29:57,591 --> 00:29:59,911
- I don't think so.
- Yes, it's true.

419
00:30:00,312 --> 00:30:01,800
A little man. Ugly.

420
00:30:02,537 --> 00:30:05,320
Said my rags would help him find
important papers in the forest.

421
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,600
Papers?

422
00:30:09,367 --> 00:30:10,635
It's the Pact!

423
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:12,933
- The Pact?
- The camp, come on!

424
00:30:32,824 --> 00:30:33,754
Marian...

425
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:36,840
- Has he changed his mind?
- No. But could negotiate a concession.

426
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,092
Nottingham cannot be spared,

427
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:41,750
but he will spare me and my family.

428
00:30:42,742 --> 00:30:44,244
You're abandoning us?

429
00:30:44,364 --> 00:30:46,887
I've no intention of abandoning you,
Marian.

430
00:30:50,694 --> 00:30:54,455
You could become my family
and we could leave together if...

431
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,800
you marry me.

432
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,771
Is it such a difficult choice?

433
00:31:04,891 --> 00:31:07,800
- Between death and being my wife?
- It's not that simple.

434
00:31:09,045 --> 00:31:10,560
How can I abandon them?

435
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,956
Marry me...

436
00:31:15,697 --> 00:31:16,600
and live.

437
00:31:27,072 --> 00:31:28,560
It has to be before sunset.

438
00:31:29,324 --> 00:31:30,863
That's when I leave.

439
00:31:46,524 --> 00:31:47,471
Come on.

440
00:31:49,351 --> 00:31:50,913
I'm slowing you down.

441
00:31:53,262 --> 00:31:57,040
- Don't worry about me.
- Hey, Much. I like worrying about you.

442
00:31:57,651 --> 00:31:59,550
Now come on, come on!

443
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,373
I won't be long.

444
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:26,679
We have numbers, so don't bunch up.
And make sure you use the little brats.

445
00:32:27,631 --> 00:32:30,164
Heroes aren't allowed to kill kids.

446
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,272
- There's no other way.
- There has to be!

447
00:32:47,392 --> 00:32:49,785
There's a ring of steel
around Nottingham.

448
00:32:50,174 --> 00:32:52,469
Even if we got beyond the walls,
we'd be cut down.

449
00:32:52,589 --> 00:32:54,446
Then we will have to fight
as best we can.

450
00:32:54,566 --> 00:32:56,616
Marian, you can't save these...

451
00:32:56,985 --> 00:32:58,772
You can't save these people.

452
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:03,600
Much as I hate Gisborne,
you have to marry him.

453
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,159
- No!
- Wherever you go, wherever...

454
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:09,160
you go, Robin will move
heaven and earth, he will find you.

455
00:33:09,956 --> 00:33:11,960
Just stay alive.

456
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,662
Robin! This doesn't make any sense!

457
00:33:18,324 --> 00:33:20,241
There's no way
the Sheriff will find our camp.

458
00:33:20,361 --> 00:33:23,679
- He knows, Much. Somehow he knows.
- What if you're wrong?!

459
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,479
I mean, look at the sun!
We're nearly out of time!

460
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,726
We should go to Nottingham, rescue
Marian, Will, and whoever else we can.

461
00:33:30,846 --> 00:33:31,920
No, Much!

462
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,253
The Sheriff is heading for the camp.

463
00:33:34,373 --> 00:33:37,177
And finding him is the only way
we can save anyone!

464
00:33:51,392 --> 00:33:52,359
Actually,

465
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,120
we won't be staying for lunch.

466
00:34:01,903 --> 00:34:03,122
I know you.

467
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,480
I helped you!

468
00:34:07,689 --> 00:34:10,371
Yeah, thanks for that. Where's the loot?

469
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:32,760
Stop!

470
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:35,800
Get your hands off my children!

471
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:48,892
Right.

472
00:34:49,447 --> 00:34:52,239
You tie up the oaf,
I'll go find the stash.

473
00:34:52,452 --> 00:34:53,508
Er, WE'LL...

474
00:34:54,165 --> 00:34:55,420
find the stash.

475
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,143
Boys,

476
00:34:57,959 --> 00:34:59,378
tie up the big man.

477
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,667
Yes, well, he does give to the poor.

478
00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:28,491
There!

479
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,665
It's here somewhere.

480
00:35:45,405 --> 00:35:46,239
Yes!

481
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,326
- Come to mamma!
- Don't slobber over it, woman!

482
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,754
Don't! You stupid old man!

483
00:36:00,861 --> 00:36:01,960
In one day,

484
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,414
I've been a rich man, a poor man,

485
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,187
a beggar man,

486
00:36:07,435 --> 00:36:08,903
and now a thief!

487
00:36:10,775 --> 00:36:11,840
Traitors!

488
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,367
Yes, and so young!

489
00:36:21,391 --> 00:36:22,160
Hood!

490
00:36:23,255 --> 00:36:26,473
Please! Please! Don't shoot!
Think of the children.

491
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:32,960
Out of my kitchen!

492
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,000
You really need
to work on your parenting skills.

493
00:36:39,925 --> 00:36:40,848
And you,

494
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,000
- you shouldn't be out so late.
- Back up!

495
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,200
You can't touch me, Hood.

496
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:51,000
Not unless you want
your beloved, stinking,

497
00:36:51,685 --> 00:36:55,559
- poor whingeing paupers to burn!
- Nobody's burning anything.

498
00:36:55,817 --> 00:36:58,560
You have to get me back
to Nottingham by sunset!

499
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,920
And there's nothing you can do about it.

500
00:37:07,924 --> 00:37:09,793
Confused, he will be.

501
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,145
Marian, we're out of time.
What's your decision?

502
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:16,960
Well, I'm not going to walk out
on these people.

503
00:37:17,157 --> 00:37:19,160
- So you're going to stay?
- Yes.

504
00:37:20,152 --> 00:37:21,000
Woman!

505
00:37:22,389 --> 00:37:24,804
Your wilfulness will kill you.

506
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:48,240
Oh, it's getting cold.

507
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:51,175
Shall we light a fire?

508
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,969
Get those gates open!

509
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:31,252
And the woman, Marian,

510
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:34,580
is she leaving with you?

511
00:38:41,883 --> 00:38:43,720
She will not abandon Nottingham.

512
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:47,630
Imbecile.

513
00:38:51,213 --> 00:38:52,440
And without her...

514
00:38:53,761 --> 00:38:55,761
my world may as well turn to ash.

515
00:38:58,413 --> 00:38:59,348
Marian!

516
00:39:04,706 --> 00:39:05,720
You came back!

517
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,920
If I'm going to die,
I'm going to die by your side.

518
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,480
Swords!

519
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,456
They're coming! They're coming!

520
00:40:02,426 --> 00:40:05,514
Marry me now,
and make it the last thing we do.

521
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:10,109
Let's steal that from them, at least.

522
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,159
<i>Gisborne!</i>

523
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,522
Gisborne?!

524
00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:22,540
Gisborne?!

525
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:31,348
- You're alive!
- Don't you just stand there!

526
00:40:31,468 --> 00:40:33,385
Give me that damned seal!

527
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,159
One day!

528
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,230
I'm away for one day,

529
00:40:41,308 --> 00:40:42,720
and look at it!

530
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,272
LOOK AT IT!

531
00:40:47,594 --> 00:40:49,440
- Are you still here?!
- No, my lord.

532
00:40:51,175 --> 00:40:52,891
You heard him, stand down!

533
00:40:58,323 --> 00:41:00,280
My lord, what happened?
Where did you go?

534
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:04,086
I just thought I'd see how you'd cope
without me for a day.

535
00:41:04,206 --> 00:41:05,401
Hood found you.

536
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,072
And?

537
00:41:07,192 --> 00:41:09,165
He could still be here,
we could still get him.

538
00:41:09,285 --> 00:41:11,627
No. No, I don't need him any more.

539
00:41:12,026 --> 00:41:13,469
Single-handedly...

540
00:41:13,789 --> 00:41:17,439
I single-handedly managed
to infiltrate Hood's secret camp

541
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:19,600
and retrieved the Pact...

542
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,870
The Pact!

543
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,696
The Pact?!

544
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,466
The Pact! No...

545
00:41:28,482 --> 00:41:29,435
The Pact!

546
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:30,507
The Pact!

547
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,680
Get him, get after him.

548
00:41:42,938 --> 00:41:44,480
Well, that's the paperwork done.

549
00:41:48,669 --> 00:41:51,296
It's my fault
we nearly lost that thing.

550
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:56,129
If the Sheriff finds this camp again,
I will never forgive myself.

551
00:41:57,252 --> 00:41:58,994
I've been a fool, Robin.

552
00:42:00,028 --> 00:42:02,040
I'm sorry I disobeyed your orders.

553
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,079
You're a good man, John...

554
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:08,510
who cares about his fellow man. Never,

555
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:10,871
ever apologise for that.

556
00:42:13,302 --> 00:42:17,088
Robin, you don't really think the
Sheriff was sleepwalking, do you?

557
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:19,504
Nothing that man does would surprise me.

558
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,946
No, I'm sorry.

559
00:42:21,561 --> 00:42:24,520
No, no-one can ride a horse
in their sleep.

560
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,640
I knew a man once who got up,

561
00:42:29,439 --> 00:42:31,178
milked all his goats

562
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:34,080
and then went right back to bed,
all in his sleep.

563
00:42:34,337 --> 00:42:37,120
- What?!
- It's true! His wife saw it.

564
00:42:37,383 --> 00:42:39,679
- Didn't she wake him up?
- Are you mad?

565
00:42:41,105 --> 00:42:43,602
She went out and bought six more goats!

566
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,506
- Robin!
- Legrand!

567
00:42:53,626 --> 00:42:54,840
Message from the King.

568
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,600
- It's a map.
- What's it mean?

569
00:42:56,761 --> 00:42:58,080
- Treasure?
- I want it.

570
00:43:00,532 --> 00:43:03,840
Let's find out who you really are.
The King knows your skill with the bow.

571
00:43:07,096 --> 00:43:08,981
- Your Majesty.
- Ah! Marian.

572
00:43:09,101 --> 00:43:11,360
We're going to execute
the Night-watchman.

573
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,789
We're trapped!
