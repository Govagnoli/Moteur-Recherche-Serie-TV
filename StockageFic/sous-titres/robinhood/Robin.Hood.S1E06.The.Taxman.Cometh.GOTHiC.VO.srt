1
00:00:02,766 --> 00:00:04,823
If you're not good,
I warn you, he will kill you.

2
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:06,330
We're good.

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,456
We're the best you'll ever meet.

4
00:00:08,532 --> 00:00:11,157
Arrogant too! I like it.

5
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:17,659
The rest when Hood is in my vaults.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,500
NOTTINGHAM TOWN

7
00:00:44,694 --> 00:00:46,683
- Morning.
- Morning.

8
00:00:47,527 --> 00:00:49,516
Ah, let's have a look.

9
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:54,256
That'll scrub up nice.

10
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:55,792
Good.

11
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:01,054
- Thank you.
- OK.

12
00:01:01,126 --> 00:01:03,115
Bye now.

13
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:11,354
Who'd have thought?

14
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:13,913
An artist, masquerading as a butcher.

15
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,757
What do you want?

16
00:01:20,324 --> 00:01:21,619
What is this?

17
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,122
Beetroot?

18
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:25,520
It's perfectly good meat.

19
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,613
- Never hurt anyone.
- Then you eat it.

20
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,815
- It's not cooked.
- Eat!

21
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:32,718
Eat it!

22
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,455
You sell this?

23
00:01:35,856 --> 00:01:36,881
People save for a month, 

24
00:01:36,982 --> 00:01:39,982
they give everything they have
for a piece of meat for the children,

25
00:01:40,155 --> 00:01:41,419
and you give them this?

26
00:01:41,588 --> 00:01:43,713
The rancid leftovers from the castle kitchen?

27
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:47,480
- They're my economy cuts.
- You'll get another kind of cut in a minute.

28
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:51,043
Your economy cuts nearly poisoned
half of Locksley village.

29
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:55,977
You've got enough for yourself now.

30
00:01:56,053 --> 00:01:58,042
Not a word!

31
00:02:02,386 --> 00:02:03,750
- Morning.
- Morning.

32
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,581
- We've come for the Sheriff's order.
- Yeah, yeah.

33
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:08,914
It's all here.

34
00:02:08,986 --> 00:02:11,145
Outlaws in the storeroom!

35
00:02:12,652 --> 00:02:14,447
Storeroom.

36
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:22,309
Stop him! Quickly!

37
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,604
Master?

38
00:02:38,682 --> 00:02:40,910
The sewer? No!

39
00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:43,771
Oh, yes!

40
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,876
Oh, lovely!

41
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:01,204
Like a pig in slops.

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,576
Well, then you should be happy.

43
00:03:02,646 --> 00:03:05,476
- What?
- That's what it means.

44
00:03:05,546 --> 00:03:08,137
A pig in slops, it means you're happy.

45
00:03:08,212 --> 00:03:10,508
I've never understood that.

46
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:13,044
Why would anyone be happy in slop?

00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:33,044

Episode 6
"THE TAXMAN COMETH"

50
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:14,544
NOTTINGHAM TOWN

51
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:31,294
Madam?

52
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,063
I am the Abbess...

53
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:36,364
The Abbess of Rufford.
I seek the protection of your Sheriff.

54
00:04:36,436 --> 00:04:37,834
What's happened?

55
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,630
Pilgrimage...

56
00:04:39,703 --> 00:04:41,601
Outlaws in the forest...

57
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:43,032
Outlaws.

58
00:04:44,402 --> 00:04:46,731
Take her to the castle, get a physician.

59
00:04:46,802 --> 00:04:48,358
I will return shortly.

60
00:04:49,435 --> 00:04:51,333
Thank you.

61
00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:57,333
SHERWOOD FOREST

62
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:12,432
I'm just a poor farmer.
I'm going into town to sell some goat's milk.

63
00:05:12,498 --> 00:05:16,396
- You will not make money.
- We won't make much.

64
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:18,896
Just enough to keep me
and the orphan lad alive.

65
00:05:19,998 --> 00:05:21,588
You will not make anything.

66
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:23,323
This is a male goat.

67
00:05:27,464 --> 00:05:30,123
Well, well! Poverty's not what it used to be.

68
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:31,685
It's a family heirloom.

69
00:05:31,763 --> 00:05:34,490
Liars... we do not like.

70
00:05:34,563 --> 00:05:35,790
What is this?

71
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:38,828
That is crown property.
And I am ordering you to put it back!

72
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:41,226
Speaks grand for a farmer.

73
00:05:41,296 --> 00:05:43,125
More like a taxman to me.

74
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:46,184
It's not too late
for everyone just to go on their way.

75
00:05:47,395 --> 00:05:48,724
Too late for you.

76
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:50,159
Please, sir! No!

77
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,159
KNIGHTON HALL

78
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:05,115
Marian!

79
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:14,387
Forgive me, I do not have
as much time as I had planned.

80
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:18,183
I have a gift for you.

81
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:20,315
Sir Guy. You bring too many gifts.

82
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:24,022
My mother used to say...

83
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:26,682
if you have wronged somebody,
or if they're upset,

84
00:06:26,757 --> 00:06:28,848
do not be proud, offer them friendship.

85
00:06:28,924 --> 00:06:31,946
If they reject you, offer a second time,
and a third until they accept.

86
00:06:32,023 --> 00:06:35,012
And that is what I intend to do with you.

87
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,884
Please, I do not need gifts.

88
00:06:41,022 --> 00:06:42,454
No.

89
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:45,511
You need a husband.

90
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:53,782
This world is not safe for a woman alone.

91
00:06:56,554 --> 00:06:58,179
Outlaws.

92
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:00,952
I can protect myself.

93
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:04,442
Even pilgrims...

94
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:08,080
There 's an Abbess at Nottingham, half dead.

95
00:07:08,153 --> 00:07:09,449
I must tend to her.

96
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:16,215
Then I would not delay you.

97
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:20,174
Good day.

98
00:07:22,018 --> 00:07:23,313
I will keep giving.

99
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,743
- What have we got?
- Tax collector.

100
00:07:37,516 --> 00:07:38,909
Very good.

101
00:07:39,283 --> 00:07:41,646
At least get the facts straight.
I am a tax inspector.

102
00:07:41,716 --> 00:07:44,274
It's two grades higher than a tax collector.

103
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:47,543
I do the bookwork,
I don't dirty my hands with the money.

104
00:07:47,616 --> 00:07:49,843
How can you be so proud?

105
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:53,714
This is not taxation.

106
00:07:54,815 --> 00:07:55,906
This is extortion.

107
00:07:55,982 --> 00:07:58,140
I count the wealth of the world. I don't judge it.

108
00:07:58,214 --> 00:08:00,373
No, we judge it.

109
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:03,175
This is 1192, my friend.
The time for heroes is gone.

110
00:08:03,247 --> 00:08:05,145
This is the age of the book-keeper now.

111
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:06,440
These markings.

112
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,675
They mean something.

113
00:08:10,713 --> 00:08:13,440
I will not divulge state secrets.

114
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:20,103
- You! Put him down!
- Hey! Word of advice, mate.

115
00:08:20,179 --> 00:08:21,508
Be nice to Little John.

116
00:08:21,578 --> 00:08:25,135
- Put my father down. He has a weak heart!
- Your father?

117
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:28,338
John!

118
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:30,467
Let the gentleman down.

119
00:08:34,377 --> 00:08:36,309
What state secrets?

120
00:08:39,177 --> 00:08:40,472
John?

121
00:08:42,776 --> 00:08:44,173
Leave him alone!

122
00:08:44,243 --> 00:08:48,300
We do not like it when people hold back on us.
Now, tell me.

123
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,364
What state secrets?

124
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:59,468
Gisborne seemed angry.
What did you say to him?

125
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,632
I said I would marry him and have his children.

126
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:03,836
You could do worse.

127
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:06,305
Yes, if I married the Sheriff.

128
00:09:06,373 --> 00:09:08,464
I would sooner be a nun than Gisborne's wife.

129
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:11,104
When is this willfulness going to stop?

130
00:09:11,173 --> 00:09:13,968
- Not to mention the other nonsense?
- What other nonsense?

131
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:17,527
- The Night Rider or whatever you call yourself.
- I do not call myself anything.

132
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:19,401
They say Night Watchman.

133
00:09:19,472 --> 00:09:23,199
It is dangerous. It is foolish.
And I have forbidden it.

134
00:09:24,671 --> 00:09:26,569
Father, I must do what I can.

135
00:09:26,638 --> 00:09:29,331
The poor cannot feed themselves,
their children...

136
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:31,097
I forbid it.

137
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,636
Your hair was a warning.

138
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:34,068
Next time you will hang.

139
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,034
That is my problem.

140
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:38,001
How can you be so selfish?

141
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,831
It is my neck.

142
00:09:41,503 --> 00:09:44,866
I am your father. This is my house and...

143
00:09:44,936 --> 00:09:46,561
You fear for your own neck.

144
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:48,534
That is the truth.

145
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:53,327
If you cannot obey me, if you...

146
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:55,333
I cannot obey you.

147
00:09:59,335 --> 00:10:01,301
Then you leave this house.

148
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,598
If I tell you, how do I know
you're not just going to kill us anyway?

149
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,995
- You don't.
- That's not much of a deal.

150
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:19,429
Well, in the real world,
things don't always add up.

151
00:10:20,465 --> 00:10:22,863
- Very original.
- But true.

152
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:32,293
The tax money for the whole of the north...

153
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:35,330
is being held in Nottingham castle.

154
00:10:41,363 --> 00:10:42,727
All of it?

155
00:10:42,797 --> 00:10:44,520
The Sheriff has the trust of the Prince.

156
00:10:44,621 --> 00:10:47,121
He has been Annual Collector
for the last three years.

157
00:10:47,495 --> 00:10:51,623
That's true. My father used to make
extra strongboxes this time of year.

158
00:10:51,696 --> 00:10:53,684
In case you have any ideas,

159
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:56,727
Prince John sends a unit of his army
to protect the shipment.

160
00:10:56,795 --> 00:10:58,192
And yet he does not protect you?

161
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:01,250
I do not move the money.
I merely count it.

162
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:05,783
Check it out as it leaves Nottingham,
check it in as it arrives in London.

163
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,587
Good.

164
00:11:10,427 --> 00:11:11,915
Master...

165
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:16,023
No, surely...

166
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:19,724
Robin... The castle's as tight as leeches' lips.

167
00:11:19,824 --> 00:11:20,921
You're scared.

168
00:11:20,992 --> 00:11:24,480
Well, yeah.
Look, I've dangled from a rope there.

169
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,956
- Not funny.
- I want that money.

170
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:30,414
I want that money before it gets to London.

171
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:32,286
Do you think taxes pay for themselves?

172
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,448
People sweat for them.
Give their lives for them.

173
00:11:35,524 --> 00:11:38,887
And when they save up enough,
they can't even afford a decent piece of meat.

174
00:11:40,257 --> 00:11:41,882
My friend here lost his mother.

175
00:11:41,957 --> 00:11:44,650
- It's not my fault.
- You're part of the system.

176
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:48,078
Taxes we do not like.

177
00:11:48,156 --> 00:11:50,088
It's one of our bugbears.

178
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:53,088
We'd give that money back
to the people it was stolen from.

179
00:11:53,555 --> 00:11:54,885
Where in the castle?

180
00:11:57,155 --> 00:12:00,280
In the vault.
Maximum security. You'd never get in.

181
00:12:00,355 --> 00:12:02,946
Yeah, you're right. We wouldn't...

182
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:04,714
May I say, I am relieved!

183
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:07,943
I mean, as much as I want to see
that money returned...

184
00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:10,244
to the people, I just think that...

185
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,979
We wouldn't get in, but you...

186
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,815
you would.

187
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,147
She was leading a pilgrimage
to Canterbury.

188
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:24,048
Canterbury, Canterbury.
Thomas A Becket...

189
00:12:24,018 --> 00:12:25,881
Everybody loves a martyr.

190
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:28,111
Her retinue were robbed
and scattered to the four winds.

191
00:12:28,185 --> 00:12:30,377
She's been on the road, stumbling
through the forest all night.

192
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,008
No servants?

193
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:35,606
No adoring novice nuns? Poor thing.

194
00:12:35,684 --> 00:12:39,878
- I have some sympathy.
- Well, don't.

195
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:45,111
They call themselves
Father Abbot and Mother Superior.

196
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,012
They call themselves by parents' names

197
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,514
so that we don't notice them
getting fat at our expense.

198
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,606
They are...

199
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:55,546
parasites dressed as pious.

200
00:12:59,715 --> 00:13:05,113
There are worse things
to dress up as than pious, my Lord.

201
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:08,203
That remark was not meant for you.

202
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,144
- I think it was.
- Yes...

203
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:15,407
Yes, it was. For people like you. What can I say?

204
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,876
I'm not sorry.

205
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:21,339
Then I cannot grant you forgiveness.

206
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,636
Where you come from,
that must be a devastating thing to withhold.

207
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:27,007
But here...

208
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:34,011
I've no intentions of being a parasite
in your castle, my Lord. Pious or otherwise.

209
00:13:34,978 --> 00:13:36,876
I shall be leaving forthwith.

210
00:13:36,944 --> 00:13:39,570
Good. I wish you a safe onward journey.

211
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,035
I've sent one of your messengers to Rufford.

212
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,303
Assuming the outlaws you are so
clearly incapable of controlling

213
00:13:46,376 --> 00:13:47,864
allow him to get through,

214
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:50,465
a retinue will arrive to escort me home directly.

215
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:56,671
I've given instructions for funds to be brought.
You will be paid for your... hospitality.

216
00:14:00,408 --> 00:14:03,897
Monies raised here
go directly to support the King and his army,

217
00:14:03,974 --> 00:14:06,701
Funds raised by the Church
go to the glorification of God.

218
00:14:06,774 --> 00:14:08,365
Not war.

219
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:10,372
Ah! Just as I thought.

220
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,372
It is meant to be a Holy War but it is paid for
out of my taxes, not yours,

221
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,905
Mother!

222
00:14:15,973 --> 00:14:19,336
I had heard Nottingham under your stewardship
was a godless place.

223
00:14:19,973 --> 00:14:21,995
I had no idea how godless.

224
00:14:22,072 --> 00:14:25,697
Yes, I know.
I should have been struck down by now.

225
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:30,662
I hope you're still here for dinner. No charge.

226
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,202
- This is your chapel?
- I'm sorry, my Lady.

227
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:49,258
The chapel is out of bounds.

228
00:14:51,102 --> 00:14:53,624
We do not know for sure it was Hood.

229
00:14:53,702 --> 00:14:55,861
The Abbess was very clear.

230
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,231
Does it matter? We just blame him anyway.

231
00:14:58,302 --> 00:15:00,131
Robin Hood, pilgrim robber.

232
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:05,823
No. I want Hood to be comfortable...

233
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:10,062
confident... bold.

234
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:13,199
Do you have a scheme?

235
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:22,222
Sir, you may be comfortable
with godlessness, I am not.

236
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,197
I am comfortable with godlessness.

237
00:15:25,265 --> 00:15:28,663
In fact, I would hate to be...

238
00:15:28,731 --> 00:15:31,697
godlessness-less.

239
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:36,662
I am denied access to your chapel,

240
00:15:36,731 --> 00:15:38,992
and so I am denied access to my god.

241
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:42,121
Whether you accept it or not,
he is your god too.

242
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:45,258
Currently my God has another use
for the chapel.

243
00:15:47,063 --> 00:15:49,494
There can be only one use for a chapel.

244
00:15:49,563 --> 00:15:51,961
Hm. Well, today there are two.

245
00:15:58,062 --> 00:16:00,051
Let me see what I can do.

246
00:16:06,062 --> 00:16:09,500
NOTTINGHAM TOWN

247
00:16:27,926 --> 00:16:29,858
Staying for long, sir?

248
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:34,487
Depends on how much money you
have got for us to count.

249
00:16:35,858 --> 00:16:38,255
That your same boy? Frederick?

250
00:16:38,324 --> 00:16:39,688
Cedric.

251
00:16:41,257 --> 00:16:43,485
Cedric.

252
00:16:43,558 --> 00:16:45,114
I'll get you an escort, gents.

253
00:16:52,523 --> 00:16:54,853
Taxes in the chapel of the Lord.

254
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,187
I love irony.

255
00:17:06,821 --> 00:17:08,253
Good.

256
00:17:08,321 --> 00:17:10,616
Let the lady get on her knees to her god.

257
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:14,983
My Lord, is this safe?
If something were to go wrong...

258
00:17:15,054 --> 00:17:16,576
- Post two more guards.
- Yes, my Lord.

259
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:18,642
She's only a nun.

260
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,249
Ah! Forgive me if I don't join you.

261
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,581
- You want forgiveness now?
- It was a turn of phrase.

262
00:17:24,652 --> 00:17:26,618
Or was it your conscience talking?

263
00:17:29,318 --> 00:17:30,977
I don't know. Have I got a conscience?

264
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,882
You like to spar with words.

265
00:17:36,484 --> 00:17:38,712
I like to spar with actions too.

266
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:41,575
- You forgive me.
- What for?

267
00:17:41,651 --> 00:17:43,616
For not praying for your soul.

268
00:17:46,184 --> 00:17:47,479
I can see you.

269
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,549
What?

270
00:17:50,617 --> 00:17:53,208
I can see you.

271
00:17:53,283 --> 00:17:57,476
Underneath all that
Mother Superior performance,

272
00:17:58,616 --> 00:18:00,479
there 's a naughty little girl,

273
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:02,707
isn't there? Hm? Am I right?

274
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:06,311
Underneath all the haughty,
there 's quite a bit of naughty.

275
00:18:06,381 --> 00:18:07,745
How dare you?

276
00:18:10,281 --> 00:18:13,247
I think you probably like to spar with words.

277
00:18:14,414 --> 00:18:17,710
I think you probably like to spar
with actions too.

278
00:18:22,946 --> 00:18:24,275
Ouch...

279
00:18:26,112 --> 00:18:29,272
The door will be locked,
so knock if you want to get out.

280
00:18:29,346 --> 00:18:33,073
You're locking me in?!
In the chapel of the Lord?

281
00:19:25,006 --> 00:19:26,631
- Money! Please!
- My Lady!

282
00:19:26,706 --> 00:19:29,968
- Please!
- My children are starving!

283
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,232
Please!

284
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,266
Help! Somebody help me!

285
00:19:36,338 --> 00:19:39,202
- Somebody help me, please!
- Break it up! Break it up!

286
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:48,666
Don't have anything to do with them,
your Ladyship. You don't belong with that sort.

287
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,494
Your escort, sir.

288
00:20:07,101 --> 00:20:09,160
The taxman cometh.

289
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:23,856
That was impressive. Thank you.

290
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:26,728
Seeing as you owe me one,
can we talk?

291
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,924
No...

292
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:31,124
Master, our mission!

293
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:32,865
One minute...

294
00:20:38,831 --> 00:20:40,592
What mission?

295
00:20:40,665 --> 00:20:42,824
You will find out soon enough.

296
00:20:45,231 --> 00:20:46,458
Do you have a problem?

297
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:48,360
More than I can say in one minute.

298
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:54,887
This life, this pretence, is driving me mad.

299
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:58,395
Gisborne sniffs around me like a little spaniel.

300
00:20:58,462 --> 00:21:00,257
My father would have me marry him

301
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:03,386
for fear of anyone guessing we are not wholly
in league with the Sheriff.

302
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:08,053
As for the Night Watchman, it is not enough for
me and it is much too much for my father.

303
00:21:08,129 --> 00:21:10,117
What I want, who I am...

304
00:21:11,194 --> 00:21:12,853
does not count.

305
00:21:15,961 --> 00:21:18,222
I am sick of it all.

306
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:20,384
I'm leaving home.

307
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,755
To go... where?

308
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,051
I do not know.

309
00:21:26,377 --> 00:21:28,366
That is unwise.

310
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:34,073
I am sick of people and it is always men
telling me what is wise and what is not.

311
00:21:34,142 --> 00:21:35,732
Then tell me what it is you want.

312
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:40,070
Help! I want somebody, for once,
to think about how they can help me.

313
00:21:40,141 --> 00:21:42,607
Help me to do what I want to do,

314
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:44,607
what I think is wise.

315
00:21:44,674 --> 00:21:46,731
Master!

316
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:50,606
- I have to go.
- Of course you do.

317
00:21:50,674 --> 00:21:52,901
- I have to go too.
- Master!

318
00:21:54,673 --> 00:21:56,764
We will continue this conversation.

319
00:21:57,673 --> 00:21:59,639
I'd like to help.

320
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:02,395
No need.

321
00:22:04,538 --> 00:22:06,004
I've made my decision.

322
00:22:13,105 --> 00:22:14,162
Gisborne.

323
00:22:14,338 --> 00:22:17,294
Marian wants to petition
our visiting Mother Superior.

324
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:18,896
What for?

325
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,368
To borrow a pound.
What do you think? To become a nun.

326
00:22:25,904 --> 00:22:27,267
Really?

327
00:22:29,303 --> 00:22:30,734
A nun?

328
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:35,061
My father is displeased with me.

329
00:22:35,135 --> 00:22:37,294
In the abbey I could learn obedience.

330
00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:39,164
But surely there are other ways.

331
00:22:40,935 --> 00:22:44,230
Go and knock on her ladyship's door.
She's in the chapel.

332
00:22:44,301 --> 00:22:45,960
Tell the guards I sent you.

333
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:04,557
Mother?

334
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:08,121
Forgive this intrusion.
I have a request to make of you.

335
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:10,062
Speak quickly, child.

336
00:23:10,132 --> 00:23:11,563
It is a difficult matter...

337
00:23:11,632 --> 00:23:13,927
Quickly or not at all.

338
00:23:15,098 --> 00:23:16,530
Very well.

339
00:23:16,598 --> 00:23:19,063
I should like to be a novice in your order.

340
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:23,063
Come to my abbey in a month.
I will consider you then.

341
00:23:24,097 --> 00:23:26,029
With respect, you are here today.

342
00:23:26,097 --> 00:23:28,086
Consider me now.

343
00:23:29,796 --> 00:23:31,091
You are bold.

344
00:23:32,563 --> 00:23:34,028
Do you know who I am?

345
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:36,187
Forgive me. I am bold.

346
00:23:36,263 --> 00:23:39,093
That is why I do not belong here. It is stifling.

347
00:23:39,161 --> 00:23:41,684
You think an abbey is a place to be bold?

348
00:23:41,762 --> 00:23:43,920
I think it is a place to breathe.

349
00:23:44,761 --> 00:23:47,318
I should like to be clear.
I would stay for a year at most,

350
00:23:47,394 --> 00:23:48,917
and I can fund my keep.

351
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:51,222
Forgive me, something about you.

352
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:53,487
You are an unlikely novice.

353
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:55,651
You are an unlikely abbess.

354
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,825
You are spirited.

355
00:23:58,894 --> 00:24:01,257
I could use someone like you.

356
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:04,589
I have no intention of being used.

357
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:26,690
Will!

358
00:24:44,355 --> 00:24:46,446
I hate this.

359
00:24:51,154 --> 00:24:53,278
So, did she agree?

360
00:24:55,687 --> 00:24:56,982
Yes.

361
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:03,236
I'm surprised you've not
mentioned this to me before.

362
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:04,632
Should I have?

363
00:25:06,102 --> 00:25:07,398
Yeah.

364
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:10,193
It is done now.

365
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:12,598
I leave with her when her retinue comes.

366
00:25:12,668 --> 00:25:14,463
Tonight, probably.

367
00:25:14,969 --> 00:25:16,229
I must pack my things.

368
00:25:18,235 --> 00:25:19,530
I thought we were friends.

369
00:25:22,068 --> 00:25:24,533
I thought in time you would consider...

370
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:28,263
What?

371
00:25:29,566 --> 00:25:30,964
Marriage.

372
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,931
That you would consider...

373
00:25:41,232 --> 00:25:43,925
Perhaps I am not the marrying kind.

374
00:25:46,232 --> 00:25:48,527
But you will be a bride of Christ?

375
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:52,860
It was a difficult decision, I confess.

376
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:15,619
Now, listen here, I've played my part.

377
00:26:15,695 --> 00:26:17,661
- What about my son?
- Quiet.

378
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,591
- No. I have to know he's safe.
- Enough!

379
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:40,690
You're wasting your time.
We've been tricked.

380
00:26:56,957 --> 00:26:58,253
- Clever.
- But it's true.

381
00:26:58,324 --> 00:27:01,756
The taxes of the north do come
through Nottingham. Every year at this time.

382
00:27:01,823 --> 00:27:03,516
I helped make these chests.

383
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,112
That's why it was clever.

384
00:27:05,823 --> 00:27:08,686
An inch of truth makes the lie hard to spot.

385
00:27:08,755 --> 00:27:11,380
I knew we shouldn't have done this! I said!

386
00:27:13,123 --> 00:27:14,554
Let me think.

387
00:27:17,955 --> 00:27:19,580
We're going to hang now.

388
00:27:19,654 --> 00:27:21,313
We are not going to hang!

389
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:27,111
Master, what do we do?

390
00:27:28,121 --> 00:27:29,416
I have a plan.

391
00:27:29,487 --> 00:27:30,919
No, you don't.

392
00:27:32,153 --> 00:27:33,847
You're right.

393
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,385
I don't.

394
00:27:38,953 --> 00:27:40,180
I've got a plan.

395
00:27:54,284 --> 00:27:55,909
As promised.

396
00:27:55,984 --> 00:27:59,177
Robin Hood is in your vault. And retinue.

397
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,648
Hood? How?

398
00:28:01,717 --> 00:28:04,046
- With all the tax chests?
- Moved for the occasion.

399
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:07,708
Gisborne, this is Flaxton. Give him a big kiss.

400
00:28:07,783 --> 00:28:10,806
He's achieved something
none of us could manage.

401
00:28:12,282 --> 00:28:14,373
Well, come along.

402
00:28:14,449 --> 00:28:16,414
Let's go and gloat.

403
00:28:16,482 --> 00:28:19,879
Before that... if you could settle
the remainder of my payment?

404
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,278
I have risked my life.

405
00:28:21,348 --> 00:28:23,211
I haven't taken delivery yet.

406
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:25,042
He's not going anywhere.

407
00:28:25,115 --> 00:28:28,410
It's just that I'm not keen
to stick around for the trial.

408
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,012
A trial? How quaint.

409
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,011
You'll be paid. Gisborne, make the
arrangements. Five hundred pounds.

410
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:38,375
Really?

411
00:28:40,745 --> 00:28:44,200
We weren't allowed to fit the locks on these.
They had to be the best.

412
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:46,369
As good as the castle locks.

413
00:28:46,445 --> 00:28:48,172
What does that mean?

414
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:52,800
It means they might well
be made by the same locksmith.

415
00:28:54,544 --> 00:28:57,476
I don't suppose there 's any point
telling you to hurry up?

416
00:28:57,544 --> 00:28:59,839
- No.
- Right.

417
00:29:44,939 --> 00:29:46,905
Guards!

418
00:30:31,201 --> 00:30:32,258
Cluster ball!

419
00:30:40,566 --> 00:30:42,156
No one has to die here today!

420
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:46,424
I think you know how this goes.

421
00:30:48,132 --> 00:30:49,791
How much did you pay him?

422
00:30:49,865 --> 00:30:51,887
He was surprisingly cheap.

423
00:30:51,965 --> 00:30:54,624
Did you really think he was a tax inspector?

424
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:57,221
Was it enough to sacrifice his boy's life?

425
00:30:57,297 --> 00:31:00,388
You can kill him if you like.
Nobody will miss him, least of all me.

426
00:31:00,464 --> 00:31:03,896
- You are revolting.
- Yes. I am godless, aren't I?

427
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:05,827
Let's finish this here, Hood.

428
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:08,056
Forget the Sheriff, forget the soldiers.
Just you and me.

429
00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:09,720
Sorry, Gisborne.

430
00:31:09,797 --> 00:31:12,228
Trial by combat's not big and it's not clever.

431
00:31:12,296 --> 00:31:16,387
- So you are a coward.
- I am no coward.

432
00:31:16,462 --> 00:31:20,724
I just do not trust you. Or them.
Now, step aside.

433
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,159
Only a coward would steal from pilgrims!

434
00:31:23,228 --> 00:31:24,557
What pilgrims?

435
00:31:24,628 --> 00:31:26,218
Defenseless women!

436
00:31:26,294 --> 00:31:29,260
Women in holy orders!
Who's showing their breeding now, eh?

437
00:31:29,328 --> 00:31:31,157
Step aside.

438
00:31:32,161 --> 00:31:34,285
Now!

439
00:31:41,093 --> 00:31:42,354
Do you know about this?

440
00:31:42,426 --> 00:31:45,187
Pilgrims? I haven't touched any pilgrims.

441
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:46,623
- John?
- No.

442
00:31:51,525 --> 00:31:54,150
The Abbess of Rufford is still alive,
no thanks to you.

443
00:31:54,224 --> 00:31:56,019
Never heard of her.

444
00:31:56,091 --> 00:31:59,682
But he dies unless you drop the portcullis!

445
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,347
Now!

446
00:32:09,489 --> 00:32:12,182
A taxman that isn't a taxman,

447
00:32:12,256 --> 00:32:15,313
pilgrims no one's ever heard of...

448
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:17,287
I think we've both been had.

449
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:23,219
Get after them!

450
00:32:38,386 --> 00:32:40,375
No!

451
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,708
No!

452
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:50,078
Mother...

453
00:32:50,152 --> 00:32:51,675
Superior!

454
00:33:17,683 --> 00:33:19,978
She was not the Abbess of Rufford.

455
00:33:21,648 --> 00:33:22,909
No.

456
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,575
You look like a boy.

457
00:33:43,346 --> 00:33:44,710
You look like a girl.

458
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,370
If my father is hurt...

459
00:33:46,446 --> 00:33:48,241
What will you do? Cry?

460
00:33:48,979 --> 00:33:52,036
Maybe. Wouldn't you, if it was your father?

461
00:33:52,112 --> 00:33:55,600
My father was killed by you English.

462
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:56,974
Crusaders!

463
00:33:57,978 --> 00:33:59,308
Then you know how I feel.

464
00:33:59,378 --> 00:34:04,309
I was brought to this country as a slave,
tied up like an animal.

465
00:34:04,377 --> 00:34:06,070
Have sympathy with me.

466
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:09,541
And on that journey,
I learned every way there is...

467
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:13,337
of trying talk my way out of bondage.

468
00:34:14,476 --> 00:34:15,771
So save your breath.

469
00:34:16,976 --> 00:34:18,601
You can't blame me for trying.

470
00:34:44,173 --> 00:34:46,502
- We've been tricked.
- How?

471
00:34:47,073 --> 00:34:49,630
- He's not really a tax man.

472
00:34:49,705 --> 00:34:52,398
It's not just us, the Sheriff's been tricked too.

473
00:34:52,472 --> 00:34:54,960
Yeah, how do we know that exactly?

474
00:34:55,605 --> 00:34:58,036
- The inch of truth.
- What?

475
00:34:59,238 --> 00:35:00,794
The money.

476
00:35:00,871 --> 00:35:02,803
The bit about the tax money was true.

477
00:35:02,871 --> 00:35:05,666
- And?
- Anybody as good as our friendly tax inspector

478
00:35:05,738 --> 00:35:08,999
wouldn't settle for a few pounds
for catching some outlaws.

479
00:35:09,071 --> 00:35:11,730
Not when the whole of the tax money
for the north is on offer.

480
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:14,532
So...

481
00:35:14,603 --> 00:35:16,364
So, Djaq.

482
00:35:16,437 --> 00:35:19,368
You go back. Untie him.

483
00:35:19,436 --> 00:35:21,163
Let him overpower you.

484
00:35:21,235 --> 00:35:23,894
Now, we will follow him and if I am right...

485
00:35:25,002 --> 00:35:27,695
he will lead us to some very wealthy crooks.

486
00:35:27,768 --> 00:35:30,131
No need. Look.

487
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:38,697
Clever beggar!

488
00:35:43,367 --> 00:35:45,798
That is weird!

489
00:35:45,866 --> 00:35:47,889
It's like a circus act.

490
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:54,188
That is horrible.

491
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,428
Come on!

492
00:36:01,598 --> 00:36:03,620
Three groups.

493
00:36:03,697 --> 00:36:05,754
Switch pursuit. Silent running.

494
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,228
Go!

495
00:36:11,164 --> 00:36:12,925
You are really going?

496
00:36:12,997 --> 00:36:15,792
I have an arrangement
with the Abbess of Rufford.

497
00:36:19,496 --> 00:36:21,485
What would I have to do
to persuade you to stay?

498
00:36:21,562 --> 00:36:23,357
It's too late.

499
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:25,418
I meet the Abbess in the castle in an hour.

500
00:36:25,495 --> 00:36:27,051
She expects her retinue tonight.

501
00:36:27,128 --> 00:36:29,650
Surely it is never too late
between a father and a daughter?

502
00:36:30,495 --> 00:36:32,483
What can I do?

503
00:36:37,594 --> 00:36:42,287
Support me, as the Night Watchman.
I want to do more, not less.

504
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,588
Protect me from the Gisbornes of this world.

505
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,250
Accept me.

506
00:36:46,326 --> 00:36:48,258
The daughter you have.

507
00:36:48,326 --> 00:36:50,224
Not the daughter you wanted.

508
00:36:51,426 --> 00:36:52,790
And if I cannot?

509
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:55,222
Then I go to meet the Abbess.

510
00:36:56,459 --> 00:36:59,391
- Those are your terms?
- Those are my terms.

511
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:01,390
I'm sorry.

512
00:37:03,425 --> 00:37:07,255
The Night Watchman may as well
put a noose around both our necks.

513
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,051
Goodbye.

514
00:37:13,123 --> 00:37:15,214
Wait.

515
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:17,482
If you feel that strongly...

516
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:22,619
You will support me?

517
00:37:24,623 --> 00:37:26,111
I have no choice.

518
00:37:28,422 --> 00:37:30,115
Then I will stay.

519
00:37:37,387 --> 00:37:38,785
Gisborne came to see you.

520
00:37:38,854 --> 00:37:41,718
Just now. I sent him away.

521
00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:45,485
He will be back.

522
00:37:45,553 --> 00:37:47,542
We will be strong.

523
00:38:17,216 --> 00:38:19,246
Welcome back, lad. 

524
00:38:19,617 --> 00:38:21,014
Tell me we are in business.

525
00:38:22,549 --> 00:38:23,913
No.

526
00:38:25,749 --> 00:38:27,544
Not unless we want to be!

527
00:38:27,616 --> 00:38:30,775
We will never have to be in business again!

528
00:38:31,249 --> 00:38:33,771
Come on, boy.
Come and sit next to your retirement.

529
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:38,906
No retirements just yet.

530
00:38:38,981 --> 00:38:40,844
- Is this him?
- You should be dead!

531
00:38:40,914 --> 00:38:43,311
- Many times over.
- How did you escape?

532
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,346
A wriggle,
and a pop of the shoulders.

533
00:38:45,414 --> 00:38:48,346
I told you, always check the tail.

534
00:38:48,414 --> 00:38:50,277
Listen. We've not taken from you.

535
00:38:50,346 --> 00:38:53,506
- We were never after you.
- No. We were just the bait.

536
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:55,340
Get over it.

537
00:38:55,413 --> 00:38:58,072
You get over it.
You might as well have been tax collectors.

538
00:38:58,146 --> 00:39:00,112
- You do exactly the same thing.
- You can talk.

539
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:02,269
You live on the wrong side of the law
just like us.

540
00:39:02,345 --> 00:39:04,867
That is because the law
has itself become criminal.

541
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:08,068
England is rotting from the top down.

542
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:09,508
Then why stay?

543
00:39:09,577 --> 00:39:12,634
We were going to Holland
to set ourselves up as nobles.

544
00:39:12,711 --> 00:39:16,268
Why not join us?
We'd make a wonderful combination.

545
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:21,570
There are many more fools like the Sheriff
of Nottingham in this world.

546
00:39:21,643 --> 00:39:23,972
It is our duty to cheat them.

547
00:39:24,043 --> 00:39:27,941
They're greedy.
That's why they are so easy to trick.

548
00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:34,271
Join us. With our strategies
and your remarkable talents...

549
00:39:39,307 --> 00:39:41,398
It would be so different.

550
00:39:41,474 --> 00:39:44,099
Forget the others, just you and me.

551
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,262
What's he doing?

552
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,435
Now you see what I have to put up with?

553
00:39:51,507 --> 00:39:53,132
What do you say?

554
00:39:55,272 --> 00:39:57,238
I say...

555
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:01,064
Little John.

556
00:40:02,571 --> 00:40:03,969
What?

557
00:40:08,438 --> 00:40:10,097
You are pigs.

558
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:12,160
And you are in slops.

559
00:40:12,238 --> 00:40:15,362
But I think you'll find
they are not pigs in slops!

560
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,865
What else have we got here?

561
00:40:21,803 --> 00:40:23,996
You wouldn't have wanted to retire on this.

562
00:40:28,002 --> 00:40:29,298
Dirty money.

563
00:40:42,534 --> 00:40:44,762
May I say I'm glad to see you there?

564
00:40:44,834 --> 00:40:47,594
You have said it. If you will excuse me.

565
00:40:55,533 --> 00:41:01,556
When you said that you would go to Rufford,
I admit, I was disturbed.

566
00:41:01,632 --> 00:41:07,757
Sir Guy, have I ever indicated that you would
have a right to be disturbed?

567
00:41:09,032 --> 00:41:11,463
Well, I would like to earn that right.

568
00:41:11,531 --> 00:41:13,826
And I'm glad that I still have the chance.

569
00:41:14,864 --> 00:41:18,160
The so-called Abbess. She was an impostor.

570
00:41:19,363 --> 00:41:20,727
Pardon?

571
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:25,452
I came straightaway.
I told your father. Did he not tell you?

572
00:41:27,496 --> 00:41:29,928
No.

573
00:41:29,995 --> 00:41:32,859
I think maybe he was being kind to me.

574
00:41:34,561 --> 00:41:37,186
There are other people
who would like to be kind to you.

575
00:41:39,994 --> 00:41:41,585
If you would let them.

576
00:41:54,693 --> 00:41:57,750
I saw him coming. I would have headed him off.

577
00:41:57,826 --> 00:41:59,314
He told me.

578
00:42:01,825 --> 00:42:04,916
- It makes no difference.
- Yes, it does.

579
00:42:04,992 --> 00:42:08,446
I had nowhere to run.
You did not need to agree to my terms.

580
00:42:11,491 --> 00:42:14,924
I realized that the daughter I had
was the daughter I wanted.

581
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:26,887
Good morning!

582
00:42:28,123 --> 00:42:30,987
I have a proposition for you.

583
00:42:31,056 --> 00:42:33,146
The next time you have meat
to take to Nottingham,

584
00:42:33,222 --> 00:42:36,710
you take it to the village of Locksley,
you take it to the village of Wadlow,

585
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:38,414
you take it to the village of Clun.

586
00:42:39,755 --> 00:42:41,778
What are you trying to do?
Feed the world?

587
00:42:41,855 --> 00:42:43,514
Don't give me ideas.

588
00:42:43,588 --> 00:42:46,418
Good morning! A proposition for you...

589
00:42:46,488 --> 00:42:50,283
The next time you have meat for the market,
you take it to the village of Nettlestone.

590
00:42:51,387 --> 00:42:55,444
Now, I am paying you over the odds,
I am paying you in advance.

591
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,781
For this year and the next.

592
00:42:58,919 --> 00:43:00,384
Do you know who I am?

593
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,418
I am Robin Hood.

594
00:43:01,486 --> 00:43:02,452
Don't let me down.
