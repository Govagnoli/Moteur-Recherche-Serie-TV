EPISODE 4
"PARENT HOOD"


3
00:02:06,055 --> 00:02:08,444
- Good idea, Roy!
- Do we like it?


4
00:02:08,516 --> 00:02:09,955
I bet we do !

5
00:02:11,705 --> 00:02:12,877
Fantastic.

6
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:14,116
Roy !

7
00:02:17,856 --> 00:02:19,999
- Yeah, very funny.
- Very funny !

8
00:02:21,143 --> 00:02:23,150
See, do you mind here,
I gotta keep the nag, right ?

9
00:02:23,162 --> 00:02:27,163
A nag? This is a destrier
warhorse of the finest pedigree.

10
00:02:27,164 --> 00:02:29,537
Of course my friend !
You deserve it !

11
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,049
Much?

12
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,013
Much, do not be so easily wounded.

13
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:39,292
- Oh, you have it then if you're gonna cry about it.
- I am not crying !

14
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:00,764
What is it?

15
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:03,830
I mean... I know what it is but...

16
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:05,704
It's a boy.

17
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:08,868
We rode straight past it, we could've trampled it.

18
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:09,942
Where is its mother ?

19
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,811
This baby is cold.
The mother is long gone.

20
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:14,216
Can you stop him crying?

21
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:15,664
Yeah, yeah.

22
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:20,851
What?

23
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:21,805
That's how you shut'em up.

24
00:03:21,806 --> 00:03:23,367
Come on, leave him, let's go.

25
00:03:23,368 --> 00:03:24,878
You can't just leave a baby.

26
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,037
Whatcha gonna do with it?
We're outlaws, not wet nurses.

27
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:31,596
How did you do that?

28
00:03:32,063 --> 00:03:33,938
You ask me...

29
00:03:34,432 --> 00:03:36,039
He's lucky to be alive.

30
00:03:36,204 --> 00:03:37,850
There're hoofprints everywhere.

31
00:03:42,496 --> 00:03:44,044
No noise, no movement.

32
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,556
What is it?

33
00:03:53,557 --> 00:03:55,286
Look at these hoofprints.

34
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:57,194
They're marked.

35
00:03:57,734 --> 00:03:59,787
Gisborne is not the fool he looks like.

36
00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:02,226
He'll track us.

37
00:04:02,507 --> 00:04:03,706
That's clever.

38
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,288
You've gotta admit.

39
00:04:08,034 --> 00:04:09,851
You didn't think of that, did you?

40
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,011
I'm not being funny, shouldn't we be moving on?

41
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,605
He could be gone already.

42
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,198
He could be here already.

43
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,688
Master, what do we do?

44
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:28,944
What can we do?

45
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:32,386
We do not believe in harming man or beast.

46
00:04:32,424 --> 00:04:33,036
What?

47
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,513
Vermin, on the other hand...

48
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:51,347
Do you mind...?

49
00:04:51,354 --> 00:04:53,661
... I'm trying to get the baby to sleep....

50
00:04:58,955 --> 00:04:59,721
Catch !

51
00:05:17,677 --> 00:05:18,447
Robin !

52
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:31,633
Roy !

53
00:05:57,945 --> 00:05:58,885
They got Roy.

54
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,292
The horses were marked.

55
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,749
They tracked us.

56
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:07,731
It's a baby.

57
00:06:14,592 --> 00:06:16,666
John, I'm so sorry.

58
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:20,143
We're going to Nottingham.

59
00:06:23,777 --> 00:06:28,919
Good news from the village Clun,
no new outbreaks for a fortnight.

60
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,995
The pestilence, whatever it was, is gone.

61
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:32,734
Then we can lift the quarantaine.

62
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,412
Feed the survivors.

63
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,855
Well the people of Clun, they are a grubby people...

64
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:38,975
The great unwashed...

65
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:41,212
Low on taxes, high on moaning.

66
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,229
Quarantaine remains...

67
00:06:43,262 --> 00:06:45,027
They must be fed, they will die.

68
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:45,781
Marianne...

69
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:47,821
Oh.... sweet...

70
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,560
My dear, you have to understand.

71
00:06:49,561 --> 00:06:52,497
These are incapable people.
They do not look after themselves.

72
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,014
we must not... we can not....

73
00:06:54,488 --> 00:06:55,390
... nanny them....

74
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:59,759
But how can they look after themselves if
we would not allow them to leave their village?

75
00:07:01,757 --> 00:07:02,861
I agree...

76
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:04,817
This is a conundrum.

77
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:09,850
Another conundrum is this...

78
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,329
Whom do I tax...

79
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:16,261
... to pay for the food...

80
00:07:16,342 --> 00:07:17,977
...for the hopeless Clun? Mmh?

81
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:20,400
Do I rob from Peter to pay for Paul?

82
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,541
Simpler to keep the
quarantaine in place and then...

83
00:07:26,717 --> 00:07:29,776
... after one or two weeks, we say the village has been...

84
00:07:30,456 --> 00:07:32,158
... cleansed.

85
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:34,766
I may house my garrison there

86
00:07:34,784 --> 00:07:37,832
You cannot let healthy people die, it is barbaric !

87
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:40,765
- If it became known that we have delib...
- ... Interesting... mmh?

88
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:42,998
This fire in your belly...

89
00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:46,330
Is this reason talking? Or...

90
00:07:46,484 --> 00:07:47,598
Is it frustration?

91
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,141
Frustration of being... how old now.... and...

92
00:07:50,724 --> 00:07:51,870
... still a maiden...

93
00:07:57,594 --> 00:07:58,570
Excuse me.

94
00:07:59,076 --> 00:08:00,344
I have other business.

95
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:10,971
My name is Royston White.

96
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:13,112
I fight for Robin Hood.

97
00:08:13,436 --> 00:08:14,049
And King Richard...

98
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:18,822
My name is Royston White...

99
00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:21,599
I fight for Robin Hood and King Richard.

100
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:30,137
It would be wise, would it not, to break his jaw
after he has talked? Rather than before.

101
00:08:31,526 --> 00:08:32,371
Who is he?

102
00:08:36,126 --> 00:08:36,900
His associates...

103
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:39,628
...raided my stables.

104
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:45,991
Unfortunately for them, I had my horses shod with an
identifying mark which enabled me to track them down.

105
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:48,828
Talk.

106
00:08:50,204 --> 00:08:52,329
My name is Royston White.

107
00:08:53,095 --> 00:08:56,188
I fight for Robin Hood and King Richard.

108
00:08:56,492 --> 00:08:57,769
I'll say no more.

109
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,181
Oh, you've said enough.

110
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:01,446
You must have had a very difficult day.

111
00:09:02,143 --> 00:09:02,803
What?

112
00:09:03,988 --> 00:09:05,254
Let our friend rest.

113
00:09:07,455 --> 00:09:08,853
What's happenin' here?

114
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:29,613
He'll not talk, I can assure you.
Unless he's beaten.

115
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:33,950
First, find out if he's got any
relatives in Nottingham.

116
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:48,419
Bring him back quickly.

117
00:09:50,988 --> 00:09:53,263
Did... did he cry?

118
00:10:11,298 --> 00:10:13,471
- What's your name?
- Annie.

119
00:10:15,896 --> 00:10:17,696
Why did you smile at him, Annie?

120
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:20,355
He has another side.

121
00:10:21,238 --> 00:10:22,999
The side he cannot show.

122
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:24,472
You're wrong.

123
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,140
Be careful.

124
00:10:29,357 --> 00:10:32,177
I have position, I would be his wife.

125
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,193
He tell you that, did he?

126
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:37,996
I'm the mother of his child.

127
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:41,625
Well, you look what he did to me?

128
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:47,709
Don't let him anywhere near your child.

129
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:50,100
Shut up.

130
00:10:50,978 --> 00:10:52,216
He's a good man.

131
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:56,623
He found a good home for my baby,
the abbey of Kirklees

132
00:10:56,862 --> 00:10:58,156
That is not cheap.

133
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:00,510
It will cost money.

134
00:11:04,852 --> 00:11:05,948
Whatcha wanna do with it?

135
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,903
We're outlaws, not wet nurses.

136
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:22,813
Central Courtyard, portcullis,
all heavily manned.

137
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:25,336
The East wall, where the builders are working.

138
00:11:26,157 --> 00:11:26,832
Teemin'.

139
00:11:26,868 --> 00:11:29,090
- How about the South wall?
- Too high.

140
00:11:29,386 --> 00:11:32,699
Look, even if we do get in, I've heard the
new door to the dungeon' two foot thick?

141
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,533
I heard about the door too.

142
00:11:34,534 --> 00:11:37,095
But I also heard that Robert of York put it in.

143
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:38,870
And...?

144
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:42,190
Well, Robert of York can't make a hinge to save his life.

145
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:46,168
The locked side would be strong as an ox,
but the hinge side would be weak.

146
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:48,598
Especially with the weight of two feet timber.

147
00:11:59,703 --> 00:12:02,611
- What's your baby called?
- None of your business.

148
00:12:06,451 --> 00:12:07,343
Seth.

149
00:12:09,153 --> 00:12:11,930
A few weeks old, got a velvet shawl?

150
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:14,112
Yes... how....?

151
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,986
Did you meet him on the way to the abbey?

152
00:12:18,234 --> 00:12:19,304
Sort of...

153
00:12:29,946 --> 00:12:31,446
The sheriff wants to see you.

154
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,868
Why is the point of us all dying?

155
00:12:36,117 --> 00:12:39,216
"For every man there is a purpose
which he sets up in his life".

156
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,539
Let yours be the doing of all good deeds

157
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,097
That's us, lads.

158
00:12:49,411 --> 00:12:50,341
Is that the Bible...?

159
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:51,798
It's the Koran.

160
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:52,914
What's that?

161
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,315
It's the Turk Bible.

162
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,703
He read it in the Holy Land.

163
00:12:56,757 --> 00:12:57,302
Why?

164
00:12:59,323 --> 00:13:01,567
I wanted to know what it was that we were fighting.

165
00:13:15,024 --> 00:13:16,350
"Royston White."

166
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:19,648
"I fight for King and Country." Mmh?

167
00:13:20,314 --> 00:13:21,827
Blahdiblahdiblah.

168
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,884
Now look, I'll be blunt...

169
00:13:24,913 --> 00:13:25,942
I've a favor to ask.

170
00:13:26,698 --> 00:13:29,041
I would be very grateful if you would...

171
00:13:29,252 --> 00:13:32,524
... use this on our mutual friend, Robin Hood.

172
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:35,105
I'd sooner kill mey own mother.

173
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:40,473
Yes... what an amazing coincidence...

174
00:13:43,234 --> 00:13:46,097
See, when people says things like "I'd sooner kill mey own mother"...

175
00:13:46,114 --> 00:13:47,957
...then they don't usually have the statement tested.

176
00:13:51,823 --> 00:13:52,442
Mother...?

177
00:13:53,794 --> 00:13:54,537
Royston !

178
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:57,823
I thought you were dead !

179
00:13:58,668 --> 00:14:00,094
I thought you were dead.

180
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,908
I was gonna come back.

181
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,549
I was gonna come back when things were better.

182
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:10,154
I never got back to you.

183
00:14:11,478 --> 00:14:12,545
What's this?

184
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,187
I like this, this is good. Mmh? Mmh?

185
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,592
The... the horns of dilemma...

186
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:19,480
Kill Robin or kill mother...

187
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:20,933
So which is it to be?

188
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,272
I won't do it.

189
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:24,630
No, hum...

190
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:29,951
You... you do not understand what dilemma means.

191
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:32,901
It means you have to do one... or the other.

192
00:14:33,223 --> 00:14:35,455
You have to... decide.

193
00:14:35,644 --> 00:14:37,392
And if you don't, well let's just say...

194
00:14:38,024 --> 00:14:40,600
I'll decide for you. Mmh?

195
00:14:42,053 --> 00:14:42,859
So...

196
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,449
Should we say...

197
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,948
Sunrise, tomorrow. Mmh?

198
00:14:50,096 --> 00:14:52,880
I don't know about you but I work best to a deadline.

199
00:14:53,277 --> 00:14:56,106
Of course, when people say "deadline"...

200
00:14:56,465 --> 00:15:01,734
It don't usually mean that somebody
would be dead on the end of it?

201
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:14,163
So...

202
00:15:14,461 --> 00:15:16,580
You've made an heroic escape, I think.

203
00:15:17,113 --> 00:15:17,832
Haven't you?

204
00:15:19,472 --> 00:15:21,527
And my men were then determined to catch you.

205
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:24,254
Oh look, and don't forget your little badge of honor.

206
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:26,846
Go on and run.

207
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:40,152
- What will you do with the baby?
- Well, we can't leave him.

208
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,437
He can't come with either. What are
you gonna do? Give him a little dagger?

209
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:45,197
A little bow and quiver?

210
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:47,348
Oh look! There's Roy !

211
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,446
Roy !

212
00:16:14,094 --> 00:16:17,379
It is good to have you back, sir!

213
00:16:18,036 --> 00:16:19,140
Good to be back.

214
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,879
Good. Yeah good yeah.

215
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:23,557
- Roy.
- John.

216
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:28,057
- Hey, how did you escape?
- Oh, you know... hum... well...

217
00:16:28,058 --> 00:16:32,681
I showed the sheriff some of mey moves.
Reckon he was impressed.

218
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:35,008
He reckoned he were gonna ask me to join his side.

219
00:16:35,978 --> 00:16:38,238
I... I said... "No thanks mate..."

220
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:40,550
I don't do red wine from Burgundy.

221
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,427
I'm an October Ale man, mate.

222
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,578
So, how many did you take down?

223
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,661
Oh, hum... a few, a few...
hum, yeah, quite a few...

224
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:50,149
- Hum...
- What? Hundreds..? Two...

225
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,264
Well, no, not that many, come on, people...

226
00:16:56,726 --> 00:16:59,963
"Moves"... What does that mean?

227
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:07,350
Stop... stop, he's gonna kill us !

228
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:09,297
What?

229
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:10,425
Who?

230
00:17:10,573 --> 00:17:11,292
Him!

231
00:17:12,283 --> 00:17:12,841
What?

232
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:16,647
The horse! It's the same trick !

233
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:18,445
It tracked us.

234
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,085
He sent them right to us.

235
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,221
We're done for.

236
00:17:31,955 --> 00:17:32,884
Much...

237
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:37,608
Well, it was possible.

238
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:39,972
We've got to admit that.

239
00:17:41,712 --> 00:17:42,487
Robin.

240
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:45,892
I need to... tell you... hum...

241
00:17:46,162 --> 00:17:48,852
- Something happened at the castle.
- Go on.

242
00:17:52,532 --> 00:17:53,214
I...

243
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:54,999
I've...

244
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:56,288
... something that...

245
00:17:58,334 --> 00:17:59,117
What is it?

246
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:03,555
I know the baby's name.

247
00:18:04,746 --> 00:18:05,998
- Okay...
- It's Seth.

248
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:08,055
He's called Seth !

249
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,608
I met... I met the father in the castle dungeon, just for stealing bread.

250
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:14,567
It looks like... the mother...

251
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,969
The thought of raising a child on her own, she
must've panicked and brought the baby out to woods.

252
00:18:19,018 --> 00:18:19,899
This sheriff, he....

253
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:22,157
He's destroying lives.

254
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:24,596
The mother lives now in Knighton and you and I...

255
00:18:24,597 --> 00:18:27,199
We should take him home and
give him someone to keep the child.

256
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,278
We're moving on?

257
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:29,840
No.

258
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:33,728
Meet us on sunset at the Long Stone.

259
00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:36,099
- But where are you going?
- Knighton...?

260
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,405
Taking the baby home.

261
00:18:38,883 --> 00:18:41,486
Roy knows where he lives.

262
00:18:42,763 --> 00:18:44,436
- Well, should I come?
- Hum, no.

263
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,461
Well, more than two, we attract attention.

264
00:18:48,998 --> 00:18:50,362
Ah... good.

265
00:18:51,353 --> 00:18:53,919
I'll stay here, sort things out.

266
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:58,171
I thought we'd have rabbit...
you know... for supper.

267
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:09,006
Lady Marianne...

268
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,399
- Good day.
- What can I do for you?

269
00:19:11,957 --> 00:19:15,168
- I need five minutes in the village.
- Ah, that I cannot do.

270
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,420
- Please.
- I cannot.

271
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:17,820
- Please!
- No!

272
00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:20,481
Step aside, I have business in the village.

273
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,702
There is a quarantaine.
Shouldn't you know that? Pestilence.

274
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,239
The pestilence is long gone.

275
00:19:24,611 --> 00:19:26,867
You know that. And if you don't, you're a fool.

276
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:28,600
Sheriff's orders. I cannot let you in.

277
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:32,356
I am the daughter of the old sheriff
and I'm ordering you to step aside.

278
00:19:32,641 --> 00:19:34,327
The people in here are starving.

279
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:44,757
If the sheriff knew your game, he'd have your
guts for garters, I'm right, aren't I?

280
00:19:44,758 --> 00:19:47,238
The pestilence is gone. These people need food.

281
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:50,470
Nice pie.

282
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:53,483
And how about a kiss to come along?
What do you say my Lady?

283
00:19:55,555 --> 00:19:57,774
Everybody still, if you please !

284
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:12,190
Having a little trouble?

285
00:20:12,738 --> 00:20:14,920
Nothing I cannot resolve myself, thank you.

286
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:16,432
Sword.

287
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:20,805
The village has been starved.

288
00:20:21,561 --> 00:20:24,796
The disease is gone but the sheriff has not lifted the quarantaine.

289
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:27,236
He wants the village for accommodation.

290
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,864
Roy, tie them.

291
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:37,757
And what was your plan?

292
00:20:38,742 --> 00:20:40,106
Sweet talk with the guards?

293
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,083
Bad idea.

294
00:20:44,102 --> 00:20:45,626
Oh, and you have a better one?

295
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:54,046
Look! It's bread !

296
00:20:54,492 --> 00:20:55,608
Quick, everyone !

297
00:20:56,513 --> 00:20:58,645
Run, run! Come on! Quickly! Quickly!

298
00:21:02,504 --> 00:21:04,041
- Bless you Robin Hood.
- Bless you.

299
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,963
Bless you Robin Hood !

300
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:11,383
That is a waste of arrows.

301
00:21:12,474 --> 00:21:13,193
No...

302
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:16,128
You could simply throw the food.

303
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:17,554
We could.

304
00:21:19,054 --> 00:21:20,455
But where would be the fun in that?

305
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:27,410
Robin !

306
00:21:28,302 --> 00:21:29,021
Get out !

307
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:31,513
We get out of here.

308
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:41,444
Robin... let me help you.

309
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:43,845
No.

310
00:21:44,663 --> 00:21:46,696
Feeding the poor if foolish but understandable.

311
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:49,312
Helping me is a hanging offence.
Give me the baby.

312
00:21:50,864 --> 00:21:53,616
- This is no sport for a woman.
- More than it is for a child?

313
00:21:54,103 --> 00:21:55,104
Is he yours?

314
00:21:55,144 --> 00:21:55,640
Robin.

315
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:57,958
Split up.

316
00:21:58,231 --> 00:21:59,644
- But...
- No buts !

317
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:02,429
Where did you get that dagger?

318
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,400
Announce yourself next time. I could've killed you.

319
00:23:10,533 --> 00:23:11,847
Did we lose them?

320
00:23:12,728 --> 00:23:13,372
I don't know.

321
00:23:15,182 --> 00:23:19,050
I said "split up". You disobeyed me.

322
00:23:19,906 --> 00:23:20,824
I'm glad you did.

323
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:24,865
It'll soon be dark.

324
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,336
I missioned to reunite mother and child.

325
00:23:28,937 --> 00:23:29,991
We should wait a day.

326
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:31,665
What do you think?

327
00:23:32,062 --> 00:23:33,215
It cannot wait.

328
00:23:33,884 --> 00:23:34,554
What do you mean?

329
00:23:36,475 --> 00:23:38,124
- Robin, I'm sorry...
- Robin?

330
00:23:42,607 --> 00:23:44,206
Don't just stand there.

331
00:24:07,797 --> 00:24:09,334
Do you know me?

332
00:24:11,504 --> 00:24:12,719
- Lady Marianne.
- No.

333
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:15,143
You have not seen me. Understand?

334
00:24:16,643 --> 00:24:17,511
As you wish.

335
00:24:17,772 --> 00:24:18,590
Can you help me?

336
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:26,153
This needle is thick and blunt.

337
00:24:26,389 --> 00:24:28,757
- Are you prepared?
- Mmh, it's the way you say it...

338
00:24:29,228 --> 00:24:30,604
You need to take off your shirt.

339
00:24:43,312 --> 00:24:45,025
Saracen attack on the King.

340
00:24:46,511 --> 00:24:47,717
Caught us unawares.

341
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:50,581
To this day I do not know how...

342
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:52,143
Is that why you returned?

343
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,118
The stitching became infected.

344
00:24:55,478 --> 00:24:56,691
I took a fever.

345
00:24:56,753 --> 00:24:58,600
And when I awoke, the King had gone South.

346
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,364
And left orders for me to return to fully recover.

347
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:03,794
So you return and take instantly to the woods?

348
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,325
It must be cleaned or you will take another fever.

349
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:13,847
So...

350
00:25:14,702 --> 00:25:15,694
You never told me...

351
00:25:16,996 --> 00:25:19,574
When I was in the Holy Land, you must have had suitors?

352
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:22,385
I must have.

353
00:25:24,579 --> 00:25:26,255
It is surprising that you're not married.

354
00:25:26,256 --> 00:25:27,259
It is.

355
00:25:27,852 --> 00:25:30,653
And yet, when one considers that marriage requires a man...

356
00:25:30,867 --> 00:25:31,735
Perhaps not.

357
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:36,083
A word of advice...
your charms, such as they are...

358
00:25:36,132 --> 00:25:38,413
...ceased working on
me at least five years ago.

359
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:39,851
- A challenge?
- A statement.

360
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:41,599
- Did that hurt?
- Yes !

361
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,174
Good.

362
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:45,261
Just tying off.

363
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,054
Kiss it better.

364
00:25:56,868 --> 00:25:57,388
Done.

365
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:06,438
You're spying?

366
00:26:06,971 --> 00:26:08,174
Up to no good...

367
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:13,798
Sorry...

368
00:26:13,934 --> 00:26:15,087
I heard crying.

369
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:16,810
This is the milk.

370
00:26:16,947 --> 00:26:19,091
And cheese for the mother.

371
00:26:19,575 --> 00:26:20,926
This is not our child.

372
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:26,706
Master.

373
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,160
Master !

374
00:26:29,383 --> 00:26:29,991
Stay here.

375
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,137
The horse...

376
00:27:06,588 --> 00:27:07,828
Can you take the baby?

377
00:27:08,374 --> 00:27:10,283
- Me?
- His mother lives in Knighton.

378
00:27:10,332 --> 00:27:11,597
What? because I'm a woman?

379
00:27:13,223 --> 00:27:15,615
Because I have to go. My men are here.

380
00:27:16,979 --> 00:27:18,566
The call of the wild.

381
00:27:20,413 --> 00:27:21,467
Marianne...

382
00:27:21,758 --> 00:27:24,399
Why is it everything you say to me sounds like a criticism ?

383
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,800
I do not know.

384
00:27:26,482 --> 00:27:28,688
I suppose these are the lives we've chosen.

385
00:27:29,243 --> 00:27:31,921
- Always different directions.
- And yours is the better direction?

386
00:27:31,922 --> 00:27:34,326
I work within the system, it is the only way.

387
00:27:35,466 --> 00:27:36,520
Not at night.

388
00:27:37,469 --> 00:27:39,118
You dress up as...

389
00:27:39,601 --> 00:27:41,423
Who is it? The Night Watchman?

390
00:27:41,634 --> 00:27:43,295
I do not taunt the sheriff.

391
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:47,222
- I do not publicly flout his decisions.
- Well, okay. So...

392
00:27:47,421 --> 00:27:48,468
Today, at Clun...?

393
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:50,956
That was different. It was an emergency.

394
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,363
And you were wonderful.

395
00:27:55,236 --> 00:27:56,489
You were bold and...

396
00:27:58,698 --> 00:28:00,182
I wish there were more emergencies.

397
00:28:01,277 --> 00:28:04,324
- Is it all a big joke to you?
- Is it all so serious to you?

398
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,071
Well, forgive me for being careful.

399
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:09,493
But so far nobody has had their
tongue cut out because of me.

400
00:28:11,395 --> 00:28:12,597
Take your baby.

401
00:28:28,437 --> 00:28:30,293
A storm's coming from the East.

402
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,809
The forest is no place to have a bairn.

403
00:28:32,912 --> 00:28:34,557
He stays here tonight.

404
00:28:34,784 --> 00:28:35,524
Thank you.

405
00:28:35,627 --> 00:28:37,053
No, no, no... We can't.

406
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:38,004
Why?

407
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,562
Well, we gotta get the baby back to his mother.

408
00:28:40,661 --> 00:28:41,715
Do it tomorrow.

409
00:28:41,926 --> 00:28:43,277
Yes, exactly.

410
00:28:43,527 --> 00:28:45,151
Now get inside, all of ya.

411
00:28:45,437 --> 00:28:46,751
I want you gone before dawn.

412
00:29:04,344 --> 00:29:05,535
Rumours abound.

413
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,898
The pestilence...

414
00:29:07,605 --> 00:29:09,192
- ...is over.
- It is over.

415
00:29:10,097 --> 00:29:11,956
Oh my dear... that...

416
00:29:12,646 --> 00:29:16,030
...was between you and me, and the Council of Nobles.

417
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,605
You see, now we've a problem.

418
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:20,890
Either I say, you were wrong, you made a mistake,

419
00:29:21,346 --> 00:29:25,238
- And leave the quarantaine in place...
- I was not wrong.

420
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:25,996
Or...

421
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:26,975
Or I say...

422
00:29:27,335 --> 00:29:28,364
You're right...

423
00:29:28,636 --> 00:29:30,074
Lift the quarantaine...

424
00:29:30,397 --> 00:29:32,095
Let the layabouts live...

425
00:29:33,047 --> 00:29:35,749
And then look for somewhere else to house my garrison.

426
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:37,373
Then say I was right.

427
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:40,953
See, there's always a catch.

428
00:29:43,097 --> 00:29:44,349
In politics...

429
00:29:45,093 --> 00:29:46,692
There's always a deal... If...

430
00:29:47,324 --> 00:29:48,994
I would've said that you were right...

431
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:50,841
Then I would lose face.

432
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,189
Well, that can't happen.

433
00:29:56,466 --> 00:29:57,941
We must have authority.

434
00:30:00,606 --> 00:30:02,614
So... I have to punish you.

435
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:05,334
For your outspokenness.

436
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:07,962
Punish me?

437
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:19,107
I do not listen to suggestions that
you are consorting with Robin Hood.

438
00:30:20,482 --> 00:30:23,172
That would be unforgivable.

439
00:30:27,433 --> 00:30:28,623
What punishment?

440
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:33,123
Oh, don't worry, nothing personal... just politics.

441
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:35,441
It would have to hurt hough...

442
00:30:37,415 --> 00:30:38,890
What punishment ?!

443
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:54,474
Marianne.

444
00:30:59,585 --> 00:31:00,987
Common flame...

445
00:31:01,744 --> 00:31:02,549
Sweet.

446
00:31:12,714 --> 00:31:15,640
We cannot have challenges...

447
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,416
... to our authority.

448
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:20,910
The law...

449
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,761
... applies to everybody.

450
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,809
Even the privileged.

451
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:46,815
Wasted beauty...

452
00:31:47,764 --> 00:31:52,177
Humiliation... sometimes so
much better than execution.

453
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:30,415
- Roy! What are you doing?
- Sorry !

454
00:32:33,105 --> 00:32:34,233
Master !!

455
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:37,388
- Get away you.... crazy... !!
- What are you doing !?

456
00:32:37,735 --> 00:32:42,287
We came to rescue you ! Everybody here
would willing to risk his life for you !

457
00:32:42,288 --> 00:32:45,614
... kill you ! I'm gonna kill you !

458
00:32:45,611 --> 00:32:46,897
And more...

459
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,320
A rescued man owes his life to his rescuers!

460
00:32:49,321 --> 00:32:51,911
He'd give his life like that for
the men who saved him !

461
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:55,277
- What is going on ?
- This one tried to kill Robin!

462
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,009
What ?

463
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,185
You were like my son !!

464
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:15,499
My son !

465
00:33:15,734 --> 00:33:17,755
Where is my son ! Give me my son... !

466
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,078
John! John!

467
00:33:19,338 --> 00:33:20,739
Kill me.

468
00:33:22,297 --> 00:33:24,657
I will kill you !

469
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,351
John!

470
00:33:27,082 --> 00:33:27,739
... kill you...

471
00:33:28,886 --> 00:33:32,563
John! Leave it! John! That's enough !

472
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,993
Listen to me! Listen to me!

473
00:33:37,874 --> 00:33:38,729
That's enough.

474
00:33:40,403 --> 00:33:45,138
Enough. I need to think.
Stop. Now.

475
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:10,356
What've I ever done to you to make you want to kill me?

476
00:34:12,507 --> 00:34:15,606
My mother... they've got my mother.

477
00:34:19,734 --> 00:34:20,937
And they'll kill her.

478
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,902
Unless you kill me first.

479
00:34:23,964 --> 00:34:26,295
And she'll hang at dawn.

480
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,159
I hate the sheriff.

481
00:34:42,788 --> 00:34:44,684
And the story about the child's mother...

482
00:34:45,912 --> 00:34:47,065
That was a lie too?

483
00:34:47,846 --> 00:34:49,408
Gisborne is the father.

484
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:50,622
Gisborne ?

485
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:54,212
The mother is a kitchen girl.

486
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:59,481
She thinks that Gisborne is going to take the
child to Kirklees abbey to be raised there.

487
00:34:59,592 --> 00:35:01,439
I hate Gisborne too.

488
00:35:01,464 --> 00:35:04,365
But that doesn't mean that this one
can go around killing my master.

489
00:35:09,495 --> 00:35:10,066
What?

490
00:35:11,578 --> 00:35:14,578
We have two mothers to rescue before sunrise.

491
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:24,980
NOTTINGHAM CASTLE

492
00:36:31,743 --> 00:36:32,487
Annie?

493
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:33,553
Yeah.

494
00:36:35,345 --> 00:36:37,018
I think this belongs to you.

495
00:37:25,854 --> 00:37:26,660
Mother?

496
00:37:27,466 --> 00:37:29,524
Mother? Mother?

497
00:37:30,156 --> 00:37:31,036
Mary?

498
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,313
Mary?

499
00:37:32,828 --> 00:37:34,291
- Mary?
- Mother?

500
00:37:34,341 --> 00:37:35,990
Mary? Mary?

501
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:41,345
"Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary"...

502
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:42,547
Where is she?

503
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:43,824
What did you do with her?

504
00:37:44,038 --> 00:37:45,935
Gisborne, what do you think?

505
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,327
Does that look like the first light of day?

506
00:37:51,064 --> 00:37:52,465
I kept my side of the bargain...

507
00:37:52,731 --> 00:37:55,037
You... can keep yours.

508
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:59,279
So... bring them...to see... "Mary, Mary".

509
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:00,781
Swing.

510
00:38:16,174 --> 00:38:17,265
Mother !

511
00:38:18,765 --> 00:38:19,893
No hood, I think.

512
00:38:21,357 --> 00:38:22,998
You'll rot in Hell for this !

513
00:38:23,494 --> 00:38:25,204
Really? Just for this?

514
00:38:28,177 --> 00:38:32,341
Mary, Mary... Poise contrary, time to see her swing.

515
00:38:33,842 --> 00:38:35,156
Murderers !

516
00:38:35,603 --> 00:38:37,223
- I will kill you !
- Annie !

517
00:38:37,266 --> 00:38:39,113
Do not... move !!

518
00:38:39,664 --> 00:38:41,478
You left him in the woods !

519
00:38:41,658 --> 00:38:43,385
You said he would be safe !

520
00:38:43,872 --> 00:38:45,726
You left him to die !

521
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:48,266
Our son... our baby !!

522
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:48,811
Gisborne?

523
00:39:17,325 --> 00:39:17,972
Robin !

524
00:39:20,006 --> 00:39:20,619
Robin !

525
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:25,885
To the horses !!

526
00:39:28,303 --> 00:39:29,056
Come on then !

527
00:39:35,524 --> 00:39:36,491
Locksley !

528
00:39:38,305 --> 00:39:40,365
Why so much haste my friend?

529
00:39:41,508 --> 00:39:44,555
Sorry for ruining your day, but if you leave, he gets it.

530
00:39:45,721 --> 00:39:48,548
This is, our old friend, the "dilemma" calling.

531
00:39:49,915 --> 00:39:52,689
Master, you cannot give yourself up every five minutes !

532
00:39:52,769 --> 00:39:53,869
Robin, no !

533
00:39:53,962 --> 00:39:55,356
Robin, yes...

534
00:39:55,396 --> 00:39:56,209
Let him go.

535
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:58,610
Or we all die here today.

536
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:02,837
Oh, come along Robin. We both of us
know we had this conversation many times.

537
00:40:02,844 --> 00:40:05,402
And we also know you are not the killing kind.

538
00:40:05,616 --> 00:40:06,202
But me...

539
00:40:08,123 --> 00:40:08,876
Run !

540
00:40:09,288 --> 00:40:10,355
For my mother !

541
00:40:10,602 --> 00:40:11,922
For the baby !

542
00:40:12,422 --> 00:40:13,722
No, Roy !

543
00:40:17,121 --> 00:40:21,942
My name is Royston White,
I fight for Robin Hood and King Richard !

544
00:40:24,479 --> 00:40:25,992
He does this for you.

545
00:40:26,026 --> 00:40:27,739
Come. Move.

546
00:40:29,654 --> 00:40:32,381
I fight for Robin Hood and King Richard !

547
00:40:34,652 --> 00:40:35,358
Come on.

548
00:41:19,249 --> 00:41:19,866
Him...

549
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:22,195
... I liked.

550
00:41:54,716 --> 00:41:55,490
Your hair...

551
00:41:56,203 --> 00:41:57,523
It wasn't easy to wash.

552
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:12,467
- Thank you my Lady.
- Lady Glasson is a good mistress.

553
00:42:12,618 --> 00:42:14,125
You will be well looked after.

554
00:42:14,158 --> 00:42:15,565
And Seth too.

555
00:42:16,964 --> 00:42:17,924
And you too...

556
00:42:18,444 --> 00:42:19,258
Thank you.

557
00:42:19,918 --> 00:42:20,878
For me...

558
00:42:21,447 --> 00:42:25,018
- Especially for...
- Go, you'll have a long journey.

559
00:42:26,612 --> 00:42:27,465
One thing...

560
00:42:29,262 --> 00:42:30,102
We, hum...

561
00:42:35,467 --> 00:42:36,474
Here, open it later.

562
00:42:36,861 --> 00:42:37,508
Thank you.

563
00:42:47,595 --> 00:42:48,575
I am going...

564
00:42:50,238 --> 00:42:50,744
...this way.

565
00:42:51,831 --> 00:42:52,845
I'm going...

566
00:42:55,752 --> 00:42:57,573
Always different directions...

567
00:43:09,157 --> 00:43:11,670
I have to say... I'm not gonna miss that baby.

568
00:43:12,313 --> 00:43:13,186
Me neither.

569
00:43:16,147 --> 00:43:16,727
Peace.

570
00:43:18,516 --> 00:43:19,363
Sleep...
