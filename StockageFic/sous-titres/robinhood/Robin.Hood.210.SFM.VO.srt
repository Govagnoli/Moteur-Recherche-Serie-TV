RESTLESS GRUNTING

2
00:00:13,278 --> 00:00:16,065
The Pact! The Pact!

3
00:00:22,078 --> 00:00:23,238
The Pact!

4
00:00:25,198 --> 00:00:26,665
The Pact!

5
00:00:28,298 --> 00:00:29,299
The Pact!

6
00:00:32,478 --> 00:00:33,598
The Pact!

7
00:00:33,638 --> 00:00:37,705
The Pact! The Pact!

WIND WHISTLES

00:00:42,978 --> 00:00:45,668
RUMBLING

10
00:00:49,478 --> 00:00:54,848
Noooooo!

11
00:00:56,838 --> 00:01:00,238
Morning, my Lord.
Sorry to disturb you.

12
00:01:00,278 --> 00:01:02,240
Who are you?

13
00:01:04,518 --> 00:01:08,658
Where's the Sheriff? I was
about to ask the same question.

14
00:01:08,698 --> 00:01:12,158
Get out! Uh-uh-uh. You hurt me,

15
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:13,698
hurt Prince John.

16
00:01:13,738 --> 00:01:15,746
I'm his special envoy.

17
00:01:16,838 --> 00:01:18,798
Well, I've never seen you before.

18
00:01:18,838 --> 00:01:22,198
That's because I arrive at dawn,
every other Thursday,

19
00:01:22,238 --> 00:01:27,418
share a glass of wine with the
Sheriff, he stamps his seal here,

20
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:32,318
I take it to Prince John and
the Prince knows that all
is well in the provinces.

21
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,057
But today...

22
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:37,018
all is not well, is it?

23
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:39,818
No Sheriff, no stamp...

24
00:01:39,858 --> 00:01:44,857
and of course, you have no idea
what's happened to him.

25
00:01:44,858 --> 00:01:48,538
No. Well, then I suggest you
find out. You know the deal.

26
00:01:48,578 --> 00:01:53,358
Anything happens to the Sheriff,
Prince John sends an army to
raze Nottingham to the ground.

27
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:57,318
Yes, but we don't know if anything
has happened to the Sheriff.
But he's not here!

28
00:01:57,358 --> 00:01:59,797
That's all I need to know.

29
00:01:59,798 --> 00:02:02,438
The troops will be here by sunset.

30
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:04,478
I've already sent the signal.

31
00:02:04,518 --> 00:02:07,845
Nottingham is about to be flattened.

32
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:06,018
Aghhh! Ahh...

33
00:03:06,058 --> 00:03:07,258
I've been watching you.

34
00:03:09,078 --> 00:03:11,205
You've been sleepwalking. What?

35
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,878
Nice silk. I am the
Sheriff of Nottingham.

36
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:21,338
I do not sleepwalk and
YOU will take me to Nottingham.

37
00:03:27,638 --> 00:03:30,158
Maybe we should start again.

38
00:03:30,198 --> 00:03:31,898
What a pretty mouth you've got.

39
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:35,142
Aghhhh! Aghh!

40
00:03:40,078 --> 00:03:43,423
Aghhhh! Argh! Aghhhh! Argh!

41
00:03:45,638 --> 00:03:47,878
Aghh! Aghh!

42
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:51,803
Aghh! Aghh! Aghh...

43
00:03:53,078 --> 00:03:54,798
Aghh! Aghh!

44
00:03:54,838 --> 00:04:03,158
And so... to Nottingham. Ah! Ah...

45
00:04:03,198 --> 00:04:04,489
Allan?

46
00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:07,348
Where are ya?

47
00:04:10,358 --> 00:04:13,358
Organise the guard.

48
00:04:13,398 --> 00:04:16,638
The Sheriff's missing.
Search every inch of the castle.

49
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:19,687
Find him. Missing? Find him!

50
00:04:29,758 --> 00:04:33,458
Ach! I want the sun
and I want it now!

51
00:04:33,498 --> 00:04:36,279
Well, you can't always
get what you want, can ya?

52
00:04:42,438 --> 00:04:47,558
This stable lass saw him go
in the night. Go? Where? Go on.

53
00:04:47,598 --> 00:04:52,678
He went out on his horse.
He was... mumbling.

54
00:04:52,718 --> 00:04:56,239
Mumbling?
Just tell him what you told me.

55
00:04:58,318 --> 00:05:00,980
He said, "Open the gate."

56
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:07,339
And what did you do?

57
00:05:09,218 --> 00:05:11,300
I opened the gate.

58
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:15,498
He was in his nightclothes, sir.

59
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:19,082
Comb the whole town, then get out to
all the villages. Just find him!

60
00:05:25,878 --> 00:05:28,937
Well, I see our kitchen
is taking good care of you.

61
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:30,818
Good food is wasted on me.

62
00:05:30,858 --> 00:05:33,158
But I can smell a rat.

63
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:35,018
What have you done to the Sheriff?

64
00:05:35,058 --> 00:05:37,898
Sir Jasper, nothing has been done
with the Sheriff.

65
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:43,578
In fact, he was seen riding out
of the castle last night alive
and well. We have a witness.

66
00:05:43,618 --> 00:05:45,338
I don't want a witness.

67
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,038
I want the Sheriff.

68
00:05:47,078 --> 00:05:50,658
Now, what's for pudding?

69
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:52,778
Your patch? Don't be so ridiculous!

70
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:55,118
This is the King's forest.

71
00:05:55,158 --> 00:05:59,538
We're working this patch,
now clear off! You've
never done a day's work in your life!

72
00:05:59,578 --> 00:06:01,937
Find your own sucker,
cos Robin Hood's ours!

73
00:06:01,938 --> 00:06:04,978
Robin Hood? Robin Hood comes here?

74
00:06:05,018 --> 00:06:08,697
Like you don't know it's
a drop point. Now go on!

75
00:06:08,698 --> 00:06:10,338
Sling your hook! Very well,

76
00:06:10,378 --> 00:06:13,678
a drop point. Off I shall sling.

77
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:15,487
Oh, this is good. This is very good.

78
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:32,699
Right. He's not been seen in
Locksley, Nettlestone or Clun.

79
00:06:33,698 --> 00:06:37,618
But there's reports of
troop movements, heading
this way on the North Road.

80
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:41,458
No! I heard about the Sheriff.
Any news? Nothing.

81
00:06:41,498 --> 00:06:44,898
What do you think? Well, if the
Sheriff hadn't left on his own
accord,

82
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,178
I would think this was Hood's work.
No, no, no.

83
00:06:47,218 --> 00:06:52,858
Hood knows the arrangement between
the Sheriff and Prince John. He
wouldn't let Nottingham be destroyed.

84
00:06:52,898 --> 00:06:57,378
On this occasion I don't
think Hood is the problem,

85
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:00,158
but he might be the solution. How?

86
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:03,858
Well, Robin knows Nottingham and the
forest better than any man alive.

87
00:07:03,898 --> 00:07:06,418
If the Sheriff is out there...
Hood's not going to help us.

88
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:10,298
Well, have you asked him?
We do not deal with outlaws.

89
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:11,978
This could be our only hope.

90
00:07:12,018 --> 00:07:15,698
If I could get a message to him,
if I could bring him here to the...

91
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:19,706
To the castle...

92
00:07:21,618 --> 00:07:29,866
You could bring Hood here
to the castle? I think so.

93
00:07:31,758 --> 00:07:35,899
He will not want Nottingham
razed to the ground. Same as you.

94
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:41,064
Very well. Do it.

95
00:07:51,858 --> 00:07:53,378
A good morning's work, lads.

96
00:07:53,418 --> 00:07:57,223
Well done. Ahem, ahem, ahem...

97
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,426
What have you got there, John?

98
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:07,258
It lays golden eggs. And tomorrow,

99
00:08:07,298 --> 00:08:11,178
there's a consignment
of magic beans coming in.

100
00:08:11,218 --> 00:08:13,378
GOOSE SQUAWKS

101
00:08:13,418 --> 00:08:18,218
John - I think we need to have a
little... Oh, give me strength!

102
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:21,138
This is the booty, here!

103
00:08:21,178 --> 00:08:24,558
This is for the kitchen.
HE CHUCKLES

104
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:27,721
Oh, could have done
with some magic beans!

105
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:33,498
Well, I'm glad to see
someone's laughing. I'm on my own!

106
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:35,204
Honest!

107
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:37,738
What do you want?

108
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:40,627
Marian said to show you this and
you'll know I'm telling the truth.

109
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,824
All right?

110
00:08:49,138 --> 00:08:53,898
She needs your help.
Just for today, you've got safe
passage into the castle.

111
00:08:53,938 --> 00:08:56,138
You don't expect us to believe that?

112
00:08:56,178 --> 00:08:59,378
Why? They've lost the Sheriff.

113
00:08:59,418 --> 00:09:02,578
If we don't find him today an army
is coming to destroy Nottingham.

114
00:09:02,618 --> 00:09:05,057
We're leaving. Now.

115
00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:09,778
We drop everything on the say-so of
a traitor to go and help our enemy?

116
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:12,938
John, I gave Marian this ring.

117
00:09:12,978 --> 00:09:14,178
She wouldn't lie to me.

118
00:09:15,738 --> 00:09:17,182
Come on.

119
00:09:24,518 --> 00:09:26,304
Put it down!

120
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,838
IT SQUAWKS

121
00:09:33,878 --> 00:09:35,465
Wait there.

122
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,579
Open the gates!

123
00:09:46,918 --> 00:09:49,148
This is weird, I don't like it.

124
00:09:54,638 --> 00:09:56,838
Can't you just sneak in anyway?

125
00:09:56,878 --> 00:09:59,944
After this, we go back,
we help the poor? Yes, John.

126
00:10:01,878 --> 00:10:05,218
There are people waiting,
we have four drop-offs today.

127
00:10:05,258 --> 00:10:07,459
They're relying on us.
WHISTLING

128
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:12,419
All right.

129
00:10:14,478 --> 00:10:16,662
Take these, Much.

130
00:10:29,598 --> 00:10:31,543
APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS

131
00:10:36,718 --> 00:10:38,598
Well!

132
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,318
You're a bigger man
than I thought, Gisborne.

133
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:44,638
Asking your enemy for
help in a time of crisis.

134
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,278
It's your crisis as well, Hood.

135
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:50,726
You know what Prince John will do
if anything happens to the Sheriff.

136
00:10:51,838 --> 00:10:55,078
Have you searched the castle?
Of course we've searched the Castle.

137
00:10:55,118 --> 00:11:00,638
He was seen leaving last night,
on horseback... in his nightclothes.

138
00:11:00,678 --> 00:11:02,718
Shock troops will be here by sundown.

139
00:11:02,758 --> 00:11:08,543
Nottingham and everything in it
will be destroyed.

140
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,529
You have people everywhere.

141
00:11:22,678 --> 00:11:25,718
Go on then. Ask.

142
00:11:25,758 --> 00:11:27,238
What?

143
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:28,967
Ask me for my help.

144
00:11:32,598 --> 00:11:34,407
Robin... Him.

145
00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:40,005
We're wasting our time.

146
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,798
Will you help us find the Sheriff?

147
00:11:47,838 --> 00:11:51,643
Of course I will.
Why else do you think I came?

148
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:02,718
Shoes... My kingdom for some shoes...

149
00:12:02,758 --> 00:12:06,618
Ahh... Whoo, a change of clothes.

150
00:12:06,658 --> 00:12:08,040
My man!

151
00:12:11,618 --> 00:12:14,166
My, er, my dear fellow...

152
00:12:17,038 --> 00:12:21,358
You, er, you do realise that those
clothes are worth at least ?30?

153
00:12:21,398 --> 00:12:24,759
Yeah, sure,
and I'm the Sheriff of Nottingham.

154
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:28,241
Ha-ha... Hee-hee...

155
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:30,498
So?

156
00:12:30,538 --> 00:12:31,758
We have to find him.

157
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:33,938
You and I will track him.

158
00:12:33,978 --> 00:12:35,538
Take one, take one.

159
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:39,257
Will,
I want you to wait in the town,
search every street, ask around.

160
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,338
Djaq, John...

161
00:12:41,378 --> 00:12:42,378
John?!

162
00:12:42,418 --> 00:12:45,818
Every day, more beggars.
John, you need to focus.

163
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:47,445
Are we making any
difference to them?

164
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,978
JANGLE OF COINS

165
00:12:53,018 --> 00:12:57,138
Robin, you can't just throw
money at them! Today we're
trying to save everybody's life!

166
00:12:57,178 --> 00:12:59,378
The Sheriff may be in the forest.

167
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:02,778
I want you and Djaq to go there,
check all the regular drop points.

168
00:13:02,818 --> 00:13:05,018
Somebody may have seen something.

169
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:06,804
Will?

170
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:10,718
I don't know how
today is going to end.

171
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:13,818
But whatever happens,
you need to look after Marian.

172
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:17,378
Of course... Will,
I'm relying on you, she has to live,

173
00:13:17,418 --> 00:13:18,800
even if no-one else does.

174
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:40,578
You do know Hood robs from the
rich... We told you to clear off!

175
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:42,458
...to give to the poor, huh?

176
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:46,898
What do you think we're doing here?
Living off scraps, my dear.

177
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:51,818
Think about it.
He robs from the rich.

178
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:55,778
He must have a huge stash somewhere.

179
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:57,338
And what does he give you?

180
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,938
A handful of scraps? Tut-tut-tut...

181
00:13:59,978 --> 00:14:02,098
Don't talk rubbish.

182
00:14:02,138 --> 00:14:04,458
If you upped your game,

183
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:09,782
then you could get inside Hood's
secret camp and - whoa, whoa, whoa...

184
00:14:10,938 --> 00:14:13,978
...who knows what
you might find there?

185
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:19,498
Now, with a little tuition from me...
Hey, we rob fools for a living.

186
00:14:19,538 --> 00:14:24,238
Oh, so do I. So do I...

187
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:30,461
How does, um, Robin Hood's
secret treasure interest you?

188
00:14:31,558 --> 00:14:33,118
Yeah?

189
00:14:33,158 --> 00:14:35,017
And your cut's the lion's share?

190
00:14:35,018 --> 00:14:40,698
No, no, no... I don't want any of it.
You can have it all, have it all.

191
00:14:40,738 --> 00:14:46,738
I'm only interested in a teeny weeny
bit of paper that belongs to me.

192
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:48,678
Who are you?

193
00:14:48,718 --> 00:14:52,045
I am the man with the plan.

194
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:58,099
So, shall we begin the lesson?

195
00:15:08,538 --> 00:15:11,166
Search the houses, one each.

196
00:15:23,898 --> 00:15:27,743
They are looking everywhere.
They're even dredging the ponds.
He's just nowhere.

197
00:15:31,378 --> 00:15:33,107
Keep searching. Right.

198
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:36,298
Ah, it's good, this.

199
00:15:36,338 --> 00:15:38,738
You and me, back on a mission.

200
00:15:38,778 --> 00:15:41,298
I mean, no offence
against the others, but...

201
00:15:41,338 --> 00:15:43,818
it's like the good old days,

202
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:46,138
back in the Holy Land...

203
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:50,178
Look - these shoes.

204
00:15:50,218 --> 00:15:54,078
They were definitely made by the
Sheriff's smithy, weren't they?
Yeah.

205
00:15:54,118 --> 00:15:56,958
That's him. Come on.

206
00:15:56,998 --> 00:16:01,838
Master, you know that ring,
the one Marian gave you...?

207
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,958
Is it a new code?

208
00:16:03,998 --> 00:16:05,738
No...

209
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:09,278
I gave it to her when
we were in the tree. Ha-ha!

210
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:13,158
What, you giving jewellery?
That must've surprised her.

211
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:15,422
She probably thought you were
going to propose.

212
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:18,226
Yeah, I did.

213
00:16:20,298 --> 00:16:22,505
And she said yes.

214
00:16:26,478 --> 00:16:29,318
Well, this is when you're supposed
to say "congratula..."

215
00:16:29,358 --> 00:16:31,047
Congratulations!

216
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:40,980
She said yes?
She did. That's incredible.

217
00:16:43,638 --> 00:16:45,458
Only if we live to enjoy it.

218
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:48,958
Come on...

219
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:51,108
He went this way, come on.

220
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:59,038
It's not enough just to be poor...

221
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:02,178
and dirty. I can do old.

222
00:17:03,838 --> 00:17:05,678
Works every time with the nuns.

223
00:17:05,718 --> 00:17:08,318
Yes, yes, not bad, but you see,
come here,

224
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:10,797
you really need something that
makes you stand out,

225
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,558
really stand out from the poor crowd.
We could be sick as well.

226
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:18,398
Better, better...
We can do foaming at the mouth.

227
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,038
Oh, and deathly pallor.

228
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:26,478
Oh! Oh, yes, the poor distraught
mother desperately trying
to protect her dying brood.

229
00:17:26,518 --> 00:17:32,878
Excellent, excellent! Eat the lot.
But you see, not just old and weak.

230
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:37,038
But... Ah! He's blind,
he's blind and all!

231
00:17:37,078 --> 00:17:38,558
SHE LAUGHS

232
00:17:38,598 --> 00:17:41,598
Ah... Thank you very much,
you're too kind,

233
00:17:41,638 --> 00:17:44,798
but what we need is a clincher.

234
00:17:44,838 --> 00:17:48,598
Now, what would make Robin Hood's
bleeding heart really gush?

235
00:17:49,598 --> 00:17:51,078
For a big enough haul,

236
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:53,758
I could always chop one of
the kid's arms off.

237
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:58,878
Ah... Ha-ha... I like your thinking,
very good, but, erm, no.

238
00:17:58,918 --> 00:18:00,368
I've a better idea.

239
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:04,278
It's not enough.
That's all there is.

240
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:06,898
There's not enough to
feed all the villagers.

241
00:18:06,938 --> 00:18:09,598
We'll give it to the families
with young children first.

242
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:12,838
No, we need more food. No.
We need to find the Sheriff.

243
00:18:12,878 --> 00:18:15,438
I don't care about the Sheriff.
All right,

244
00:18:15,478 --> 00:18:18,158
then you don't care about Nottingham.

245
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:20,138
That's not what I meant. John.

246
00:18:20,178 --> 00:18:24,279
If the Sheriff isn't found,
Nottingham will be destroyed.

247
00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:29,758
Everyone, everyone else is
out looking for the Sheriff.

248
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:31,885
Yes. And that's what
we should be doing too.

249
00:18:33,598 --> 00:18:35,598
I can't let people starve.

250
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:38,278
And I won't go against
Robin's orders. Why?

251
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:42,408
Because he's right.
And he's our leader.

252
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:47,481
Leaders can be wrong.

253
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:55,128
Sir Jasper...

254
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:59,178
...I think that we can
come to some sort of understanding.

255
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:03,458
You see, I know that you're
only acting in the Sheriff's
best interests and so are we.

256
00:19:03,498 --> 00:19:05,418
You're not doing
a very good job of it.

257
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,998
The truth is that we just don't know
where he is. And we need more time.

258
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:12,218
Look, rules are rules. If I make
an exception, the next thing,

259
00:19:12,258 --> 00:19:17,257
every other ambitious young captain
is murdering his sheriff
thinking he can get away with it.

260
00:19:17,258 --> 00:19:20,897
I've not murdered the Sheriff,
I can assure you. Well...

261
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:22,698
GISBORNE SIGHS

262
00:19:22,738 --> 00:19:24,518
I could make you a very rich man.

263
00:19:28,138 --> 00:19:31,777
Look, if Nottingham or Derby or
any other town under Prince John's

264
00:19:31,778 --> 00:19:35,618
protection gets razed to the
ground, it has to be rebuilt.

265
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:42,126
And it so happens that the Royal
Charter for Reconstruction has
been licensed to my cousin.

266
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:48,520
Did you think I was going to be a
glorified messenger all my life?

267
00:19:51,218 --> 00:19:53,697
You really are going to do this,
aren't you? Oh, yes,

268
00:19:53,698 --> 00:19:58,818
come sunset,
no Sheriff, no Nottingham.

269
00:19:58,858 --> 00:20:01,958
It always amazes me how
much dust an army kicks up.

270
00:20:03,218 --> 00:20:06,278
But then it's a very big army.

271
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:31,438
Three more drops. Yes, one here
and two more before the river.

272
00:20:31,478 --> 00:20:34,118
Someone must have seen
the Sheriff by now.

273
00:20:34,158 --> 00:20:37,007
WOMAN WEEPS
Oh, my baby!

274
00:20:38,578 --> 00:20:41,518
Dear God... Oh, my baby!

275
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:44,118
Oh, my baby!

276
00:20:44,158 --> 00:20:46,378
ALL WEEP

277
00:20:46,418 --> 00:20:51,158
No-one... No-one should be reduced
to this.

278
00:20:51,198 --> 00:20:55,720
By the looks of them, that is not
the last grave they'll dig.

279
00:20:57,638 --> 00:20:59,438
Not if I can help it.

280
00:20:59,478 --> 00:21:01,360
THEY CONTINUE TO WEEP

281
00:21:03,258 --> 00:21:05,988
Oh, my baby!

282
00:21:10,198 --> 00:21:13,986
Do not be alarmed,
no-one will hurt you.

283
00:21:18,438 --> 00:21:19,638
We're with Robin Hood.

284
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,458
Oh, God bless ya.

285
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:25,878
God bless ya. Why didn't he take me

286
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:29,006
instead of my only grandchild...?

287
00:21:30,078 --> 00:21:32,678
We must stay here and help them.

288
00:21:32,718 --> 00:21:35,943
John, we have a mission.
THEY are our mission.

289
00:21:37,478 --> 00:21:41,798
Robin has asked us...
Robin is not here! We are.

290
00:21:41,838 --> 00:21:44,608
These people need our help.

291
00:21:47,418 --> 00:21:49,538
WOMAN CONTINUES TO WEEP

292
00:21:49,578 --> 00:21:53,278
Jasper will not be swayed.
There's still time.

293
00:21:53,318 --> 00:21:57,398
There's still time
for you to get away. No.

294
00:21:57,438 --> 00:22:00,798
You did not run when I
was being held hostage.

295
00:22:00,838 --> 00:22:03,039
I'm not leaving you in trouble.

296
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:10,058
Well, then...

297
00:22:10,098 --> 00:22:12,447
we must prepare to defend ourselves.

298
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:17,609
DIN AS VILLAGERS
PREPARE FOR ATTACK

299
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:26,166
Search all of the villages,
just find him. Go. Ask around.

300
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:36,939
I don't think we're going
to get out of this, Will.

301
00:22:42,498 --> 00:22:45,138
But if we do, do you...?

302
00:22:45,178 --> 00:22:47,458
Do you reckon I could
come back to the lads?

303
00:22:47,498 --> 00:22:51,218
HE SCOFFS
You're too late, Allan.

304
00:22:51,258 --> 00:22:53,498
Miles too late. Come on!

305
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:57,838
I've made a few mistakes, but...
Mistakes?! You deliberately
betrayed us!

306
00:22:57,878 --> 00:23:01,098
All right, strictly speaking,
that's true. Yeah. Yeah.

307
00:23:01,138 --> 00:23:03,018
But it's not that simple,
Will, all right?

308
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:06,761
I never told Gisborne where the
camp is. I saved your life, didn't I?

309
00:23:07,738 --> 00:23:11,658
Well? I know a lot of about
how this place works now.

310
00:23:11,698 --> 00:23:14,298
That's gonna help Robin, right?

311
00:23:14,338 --> 00:23:16,846
What do you reckon?
The old team, back together?

312
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,578
You're with Gisborne now.

313
00:23:21,618 --> 00:23:23,842
There's no coming back from there.

314
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:32,218
I'm getting used to it,
life as an heroic outlaw.

315
00:23:32,258 --> 00:23:34,338
The King will come back,

316
00:23:34,378 --> 00:23:39,098
you and Marian will be married
living in some grand old mansion.

317
00:23:39,138 --> 00:23:40,941
And I'll just... Well, well well.

318
00:23:44,778 --> 00:23:46,538
Look at these marks.

319
00:23:46,578 --> 00:23:48,426
They carry on this way, come on.

320
00:23:50,418 --> 00:23:54,057
I mean, it's all going to end.
Tell it to the sun, Much!

321
00:23:54,058 --> 00:24:00,298
Look, it's racing across the sky
and if we don't find the Sheriff
before sundown, everything will end.

322
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:03,218
Me, you, Marian, everything!

323
00:24:03,258 --> 00:24:06,005
There'll be nothing
left but scorched earth.

324
00:24:10,138 --> 00:24:13,718
Oh! It's so cold. So cold.

325
00:24:13,758 --> 00:24:16,158
I've got some medicines
back at camp.

326
00:24:16,198 --> 00:24:17,580
No.

327
00:24:20,618 --> 00:24:24,304
We take them with us.
The camp is secret.

328
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:28,538
Look at them!

329
00:24:28,578 --> 00:24:32,861
Do you really think it's a good idea
to leave them out here? Truthfully?

330
00:24:35,738 --> 00:24:37,818
The old man won't know.

331
00:24:37,858 --> 00:24:39,740
The rest we blindfold.

332
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:44,358
Can I just have a word?

333
00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:46,138
I assume you're talking to me.

334
00:24:46,178 --> 00:24:48,978
Sorry, Sir Jasper, if
you've got a moment. Go on.

335
00:24:49,018 --> 00:24:52,258
Between you and me, Guy is not
very good at talking himself up.

336
00:24:52,298 --> 00:24:58,078
I just want you know to know we're
doing everything we can here, even
if he's not showing it. Good.

337
00:24:58,118 --> 00:25:01,217
There's not a long of men would
do what Guy's doing right now.

338
00:25:01,218 --> 00:25:03,558
You should keep him in mind
for other things.

339
00:25:03,598 --> 00:25:08,458
He could be very useful in another
county. What? Him and YOU?

340
00:25:08,498 --> 00:25:10,438
Well, yeah, I suppose so.

341
00:25:10,478 --> 00:25:14,558
It's interesting, isn't it, when
people realise that they're
going to die,

342
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:18,107
suddenly all this new-found
loyalty creeps out of the woodwork?

343
00:25:19,078 --> 00:25:22,898
Well, I want to live. Allan...
You'd better find the
Sheriff then, hadn't you?

344
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,398
I thought I gave you a job to do.

345
00:25:24,438 --> 00:25:26,184
You did. I'm on it.

346
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:32,278
Your boy really wants to save you.
This isn't about me, is it? This
is about the people of Nottingham.

347
00:25:32,318 --> 00:25:36,358
Correct. And much as I dislike you,
you need not fear the onslaught.

348
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:41,397
As a Black Knight,
you and your family may pass
freely through the town.

349
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:44,698
I have no family.
Good. Keeps things simple.

350
00:25:44,738 --> 00:25:46,758
But I do have friends.

351
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,397
Family. Not friends.
One person in particular.

352
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:52,678
Oh, a particular Lady Marian? Yes.

353
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:58,498
We were once engaged and I confess I
have reason to hope that, in time...
Wait, wait, wait. "Reason to hope"?

354
00:25:58,538 --> 00:26:00,397
Doesn't really wash.

355
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:03,678
...in time, she will be family.
In time?

356
00:26:03,718 --> 00:26:06,909
Yes. In time she will be my wife.
Not if she's dead.

357
00:26:08,498 --> 00:26:10,897
Marian comes with me. Yes.

358
00:26:10,898 --> 00:26:12,958
If you've married her by then.

359
00:26:12,998 --> 00:26:15,238
I can't marry her between
now and sunset, can I?!

360
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,538
Why not? She's hardly
going to say no, is she?

361
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:23,238
GISBORNE SIGHS

362
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:26,264
A BELL TOLLS

363
00:26:41,358 --> 00:26:44,118
BELL CONTINUES TO TOLL
Sir Jasper, Sir Jasper?

364
00:26:44,158 --> 00:26:47,318
The time for talking is over.
I have to brief my troops.

365
00:26:47,358 --> 00:26:49,558
Well, at least let us
evacuate the town! No.

366
00:26:49,598 --> 00:26:52,798
But the women and children,
spare them, please...
An example has to be set.

367
00:26:52,838 --> 00:26:56,404
As Prince John always says, the
best examples are written in blood.

368
00:26:58,198 --> 00:27:02,362
How many? They're surrounding the
whole town. It's going to
take a lot to do that.

369
00:27:16,918 --> 00:27:19,198
Get all of our guards
into siege positions.

370
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:22,158
What guards? They're all
out looking for the Sheriff.

371
00:27:22,198 --> 00:27:25,898
Then get every able-bodied
man into the armoury. Do you
trust this lot with weapons?

372
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:27,958
We're fighting for our lives now.
All of us.

373
00:27:27,998 --> 00:27:30,578
SOLDIER SHOUTS COMMANDS

374
00:27:30,618 --> 00:27:32,921
Hang on... Just do it! All right.

375
00:27:40,218 --> 00:27:42,118
Here we are.

376
00:27:43,098 --> 00:27:46,078
Try to get some rest.
We'll bring food and medicine.

377
00:27:47,998 --> 00:27:52,738
Ah, the promised land.

378
00:27:52,778 --> 00:27:55,320
Oh... Oh!

379
00:27:58,038 --> 00:27:59,598
Help me... I'm coming.

380
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:04,798
Help me. This way, I'm here now. Help
me... Just straight on. Straight on.

381
00:28:04,838 --> 00:28:06,338
A little bit of cheese...

382
00:28:06,378 --> 00:28:09,967
Yep, we'll give you
a little wash first. Oh...

383
00:28:23,358 --> 00:28:25,963
Where's Marian? Will.

384
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:31,159
It looks like we're brothers
in arms again after all. Ha-ha!
Not exactly what I had in mind.

385
00:28:42,578 --> 00:28:45,098
Will! Any word from Robin?

386
00:28:45,138 --> 00:28:48,138
But I know he will die
before he stops looking.

387
00:28:48,178 --> 00:28:51,978
Today that's not good enough, Will.
Marian...

388
00:28:52,018 --> 00:28:53,658
one person who can't die is you.

389
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,138
There's no way out.

390
00:28:55,178 --> 00:28:58,164
I promised Robin you'd be safe.

391
00:29:09,858 --> 00:29:16,548
Where is he going? You know,
I was thinking, I might stay here
when you and Marian are, you know...

392
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:19,138
Much. Look.

393
00:29:19,178 --> 00:29:20,818
I think we're going in on him.

394
00:29:20,858 --> 00:29:22,740
These are fresh footprints.

395
00:29:25,018 --> 00:29:26,940
Or I could be a lone outlaw.

396
00:29:28,658 --> 00:29:31,618
The Sherwood Avenger...

397
00:29:31,658 --> 00:29:33,939
Much, come here.

398
00:29:37,178 --> 00:29:42,059
Yes! Only one man in Nottingham
has nightclothes like that! Oi!

399
00:29:47,378 --> 00:29:51,578
I don't believe it. Where
did you get those clothes?

400
00:29:51,618 --> 00:29:54,898
I traded them, fair and square.
For some good rags.

401
00:29:54,938 --> 00:30:01,097
You traded rags for silk pyjamas?
I don't think so. Yes, it's true.

402
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:02,518
A little man. Ugly.

403
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,943
Said my rags would help him find
important papers in the forest.
Papers?

404
00:30:08,378 --> 00:30:12,701
It's the Pact!
The Pact? The camp, come on!

405
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:37,558
Marian... Has he changed his mind?
No. But I've managed to negotiate
a concession.

406
00:30:37,598 --> 00:30:42,158
Nottingham cannot be spared,
but he will spare me and my family.

407
00:30:42,198 --> 00:30:44,518
You're abandoning us?

408
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:47,464
I've no intention of abandoning you,
Marian.

409
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:55,459
You could become my family
and we could leave together if...

410
00:30:56,878 --> 00:30:58,118
...you marry me.

411
00:31:03,118 --> 00:31:05,158
Is it such a difficult choice?

412
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:08,518
Between death and being my wife?

413
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:11,260
How can I abandon them?

414
00:31:14,478 --> 00:31:17,299
Marry me... and live.

415
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:29,478
It has to be before sunset.

416
00:31:29,518 --> 00:31:31,901
That's when I leave.

417
00:31:42,198 --> 00:31:43,881
Arghhh!

418
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,569
Come on.

419
00:31:49,718 --> 00:31:51,447
I'm slowing you down.

420
00:31:53,418 --> 00:31:58,038
Don't worry about me. Hey, Much.
I like worrying about you.

421
00:31:58,078 --> 00:32:00,609
Now come on, come on!

422
00:32:12,318 --> 00:32:14,286
I won't be long.

423
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:26,999
We have numbers, so don't bunch up.
And make sure
you use the little brats.

424
00:32:28,158 --> 00:32:30,820
Heroes aren't allowed to kill kids.

425
00:32:44,758 --> 00:32:50,506
There's no other way. There has
to be! There's a ring of steel
around Nottingham.

426
00:32:50,546 --> 00:32:55,010
Even if we got beyond the walls,
we'd be cut down. Then we will have
to fight as best we can.

427
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:57,433
Marian, you can't save these...

428
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,716
(You can't save these people.)

429
00:32:59,756 --> 00:33:04,361
Much as I hate Gisborne,
you have to marry him.

430
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:09,899
No! Wherever you go,
wherever you go, Robin will move
heaven and earth, he will find you.

431
00:33:09,939 --> 00:33:13,346
Just stay alive.

432
00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:18,859
Robin! This doesn't make any sense!

433
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:21,379
There's no way
the Sheriff will find our camp.

434
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:26,499
He knows, Much. Somehow he knows.
What if you're wrong?!
I mean, look at the sun!

435
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:32,698
We're nearly out of time! We should
go to Nottingham, rescue Marian and
Will, and whoever else we can. No!

436
00:33:32,699 --> 00:33:38,023
The Sheriff is heading for the camp.
And finding him
is the only way we can save anyone!

437
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:55,866
Actually,
we won't be staying for lunch.

438
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:03,903
I know you.

439
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:10,786
I helped you! Yeah, thanks
for that. Where's the loot?

440
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:33,179
Stop!

441
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:36,546
Get your hands off my children!

442
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,038
Right. You tie up the oaf,
I'll go find the stash.

443
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,359
Er, WE'LL find the stash.

444
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,943
Boys, tie up the big man.

445
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:27,279
Yes, well, he does give to the poor.

446
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:28,541
There!

447
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:42,141
It's here somewhere.

448
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:47,319
Yes!

449
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,799
Ha-ha-ha! Come to mamma!

450
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:53,404
Don't slobber over it, woman!

451
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:58,639
Don't! You stupid old man!

452
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:02,359
In one day,

453
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:06,158
I've been a rich man, a poor man,

454
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:09,560
a beggar man, and now a thief!

455
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:13,439
Traitors!

456
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:16,840
Yes - and so young!

457
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,524
Hood!

458
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,000
Please! Please! Don't shoot!
Think of the children.

459
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:34,243
Out of my kitchen!

460
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,887
You really need
to work on your parenting skills.

461
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:41,839
And you -

462
00:36:41,879 --> 00:36:44,728
you shouldn't be out so late.
Back up!

463
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:49,139
You can't touch me, Hood.

464
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:55,059
Not unless you want
your beloved, stinking,
poor whingeing paupers to burn!

465
00:36:55,099 --> 00:36:59,319
Nobody's burning anything.
Oh, you have to get me back
to Nottingham by sunset!

466
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,288
And there's nothing you can do
about it.

467
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:11,639
Confused, he will be.

468
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:14,939
Marian, we're out of time.
What's your decision?

469
00:37:14,979 --> 00:37:17,338
Well, I'm not going to walk out
on these people.

470
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:19,919
So you're going to stay? Yes.

471
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:21,363
Woman!

472
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:26,768
Your wilfulness will kill you.

473
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:48,979
Oh, it's getting cold.

474
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:51,721
Shall we light a fire?

475
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,680
Get those gates open!

476
00:38:27,779 --> 00:38:29,979
And the woman -

477
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:34,689
Marian - is she leaving with you?

478
00:38:41,659 --> 00:38:44,459
She will not abandon Nottingham.

479
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:46,419
HE LAUGHS

480
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:48,683
Imbecile.

481
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:52,809
And without her...

482
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:57,279
...my world may as well turn to ash.

483
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:00,404
Marian!

484
00:39:03,939 --> 00:39:06,099
You came back!

485
00:39:06,139 --> 00:39:09,648
If I'm going to die,
I'm going to die by your side.

486
00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:14,187
Swords!

487
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:29,685
They're coming! They're coming!

488
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:06,043
Marry me now,
and make it the last thing we do.

489
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:11,006
Let's steal that from them,
at least.

490
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:14,567
THE SHERIFF: Gisborne!

491
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:19,623
Gisborne?!

492
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:23,762
Gisborne?!

493
00:40:28,879 --> 00:40:33,509
You're alive! Don't you just stand
there! Give me that damned seal!

494
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:38,299
One day!

495
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:40,219
I'm away for one day,

496
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:43,479
and look at it!

497
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:46,221
Huh? LOOK AT IT!

498
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:50,199
Are you still here?! No, my lord.

499
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,259
You heard him, stand down!

500
00:40:58,479 --> 00:41:01,039
My lord, what happened?
Where did you go?

501
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:04,279
I just thought I'd see
how you'd cope without me for a day.

502
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,279
Hood found you.

503
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:12,239
And? He could still be here,
we could still get him. No.
No, I don't need him any more.

504
00:41:12,279 --> 00:41:13,439
Single-handedly...

505
00:41:13,479 --> 00:41:21,399
I single-handedly managed
to infiltrate Hood's secret camp
and retrieved the Pact... Ha-ha!

506
00:41:21,439 --> 00:41:23,105
The Pact!

507
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:28,159
The Pact?! The Pact! No...

508
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:30,638
The Pact! The Pact!

509
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:33,426
Get him, get after him.

510
00:41:43,439 --> 00:41:45,202
Well, that's the paperwork done.

511
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,946
It's my fault
we nearly lost that thing.

512
00:41:52,759 --> 00:41:56,999
If the Sheriff finds this camp
again, I will never forgive myself.

513
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:02,799
I've been a fool, Robin.
I'm sorry I disobeyed your orders.

514
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:05,198
You're a good man, John...

515
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:08,319
who cares about his fellow man.

516
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,823
Never, ever apologise for that.

517
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:16,539
Robin, you don't really think the
Sheriff was sleepwalking, do you?

518
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:20,119
Nothing that man does
would surprise me.

519
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:21,599
No, I'm sorry.

520
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:25,318
No, no-one can ride a horse
in their sleep.

521
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:29,399
Ah! I knew a man once who got up,

522
00:42:29,439 --> 00:42:34,839
milked all his goats and then went
right back to bed - all in his sleep.

523
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,519
What?! It's true! His wife saw it.

524
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:40,261
Didn't she wake him up? Are you mad?

525
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:44,949
She went out
and bought six more goats!

526
00:42:52,919 --> 00:42:55,599
Robin! Legrand!
I've a message from the King.

527
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:57,359
It's a map. What's it mean?

528
00:42:57,399 --> 00:42:58,826
Treasure? I want it.

529
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:04,226
Let's find out who you really are.
The King knows your skill
with the bow.

530
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:12,102
Your Majesty. Ah! Marian. We're
going to execute the Night-watchman.

531
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:15,370
We're trapped!

532
