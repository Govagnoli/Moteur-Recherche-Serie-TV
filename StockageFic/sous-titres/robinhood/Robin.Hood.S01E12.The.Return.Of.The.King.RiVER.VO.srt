1
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,960
Ah. Gisborne.
Hold a bird. Come on.

2
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:19,983
Here, come on. Give him some love. Hm?

3
00:00:20,068 --> 00:00:22,539
Poor thing.

4
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,069
It is poetry, though, isn't it?

5
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,042
Caged bird, a creature that would fly free,

6
00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:32,310
absolutely under my control.

7
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:36,064
It's good, I like it.

8
00:00:36,065 --> 00:00:40,010
Now, talking of caged prettiness...

9
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:42,478
when are you marrying Marian?

10
00:00:43,098 --> 00:00:47,161
- In due course.
- Oh, come along, don't be coy.

11
00:00:47,253 --> 00:00:49,974
- That's not the arrangement, is it?
- No.

12
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:52,905
- We will marry when the King returns.
- Ah.

13
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:57,616
When the King comes.
I might have news for you there.

14
00:00:59,084 --> 00:01:00,689
- What news?
- Do you know,

15
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,269
sometimes I don't feed them
for, ooh, three days.

16
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,244
Cruel, perhaps, but I find it
makes them sing better.

17
00:01:06,245 --> 00:01:08,743
What news?

18
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:12,007
Oh, Gisborne.

19
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:15,881
I hate the cave.

20
00:01:15,882 --> 00:01:18,761
It's gonna rain again
and it's dry in there.

21
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:22,360
It's dark and it's, you know, horrible.

22
00:01:22,674 --> 00:01:24,878
We voted, Much.

23
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:26,925
And you lost, five-one.

24
00:01:27,577 --> 00:01:29,108
Yeah, well...

25
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:31,675
I should have two votes,
because I really don't like the cave.

26
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:33,144
In fact, I should have three,

27
00:01:33,145 --> 00:01:34,996
because I really, really
don't like the cave.

28
00:01:42,463 --> 00:01:46,221
Bats! I hate... bats!

29
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:49,427
Bats are rats, rats with wings.

30
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,830
No, they are intelligent.

31
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:53,549
Bats make noises you cannot hear.

32
00:01:53,597 --> 00:01:55,946
What's the point of that?
Noises you can't hear?

33
00:01:56,036 --> 00:01:58,271
What if there was a noise
nobody could hear?

34
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,118
And then if you were the only person
who could hear it.

35
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,358
Because I am that person.

36
00:02:03,443 --> 00:02:06,418
To see sense where others see no sense.

37
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:08,650
Just like the bat.

38
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:10,513
I take it back.

39
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:12,768
I like the bat.

40
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:17,531
The bat is my friend.
The bat understands me.

41
00:02:20,688 --> 00:02:23,461
What took you so long?

42
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:25,860
Well done!

43
00:02:26,184 --> 00:02:28,382
Bread, good.

44
00:02:32,726 --> 00:02:33,779
All right!

45
00:02:37,818 --> 00:02:38,732
Well?

46
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:43,095
What's the matter?

47
00:02:46,714 --> 00:02:47,836
The King is coming.

48
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:53,021
Resynced and adapted by
ScarHand

49
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,249
For the SubWood Team

50
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:30,219
Richard? To England?

51
00:03:30,303 --> 00:03:32,296
Yeah, that'll be right!

52
00:03:32,385 --> 00:03:34,981
It's not a rumor, John.

53
00:03:36,428 --> 00:03:39,469
I spoke to Thornton. He heard Gisborne talking.

54
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:41,863
- To England?
- To Nottingham.

55
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:44,994
They're saying he's landed at Hull,
he's gonna come here on his way to London.

56
00:03:45,077 --> 00:03:47,468
The King? To Nottingham?

57
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:49,611
Oh, this is good, isn't it?

58
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:51,454
- The King?
- Yes.

59
00:03:52,424 --> 00:03:56,136
Oh, this is a good day.
After all, we have bread and the King is coming.

60
00:03:56,227 --> 00:03:58,424
- Will you just shut up?
- No!

61
00:03:58,509 --> 00:04:02,904
This is what we've been waiting for.
The Sheriff will be ousted, and Gisborne.

62
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:05,190
Then Robin can go home, I can go home,
Little John...

63
00:04:05,191 --> 00:04:06,138
Little John's an outlaw.

64
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:08,893
- We all are.
- Robin will pardon you.

65
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,671
- Obviously.
- Will?

66
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:13,640
Oh, this is great, isn't it?

67
00:04:13,723 --> 00:04:16,638
Well, we should have a feast! This is wonderful!

68
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:18,400
Shut up!

69
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:21,528
- Will.
- Well, excuse me for being pleased

70
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,568
that all our prayers are answered.

71
00:04:26,255 --> 00:04:27,928
Tell me.

72
00:04:32,781 --> 00:04:34,738
Come on, tell me.

73
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:40,219
Gisborne is saying... Now the King's
coming back, Gisborne is saying...

74
00:04:40,308 --> 00:04:42,220
Gisborne is saying he'll marry Marian.

75
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:46,711
Ah.

76
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,878
She'll never go through with it.

77
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,675
Gisborne says the wedding's on Saturday.

78
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:07,572
Marian.

79
00:05:07,653 --> 00:05:09,327
Sir Edward.

80
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:15,895
I bring good news.

81
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:18,053
There 's something I...

82
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:19,782
No.

83
00:05:19,864 --> 00:05:23,257
- Oh! What are you doing?
- What do you think you...?

84
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:29,665
Sir Guy!

85
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:33,708
I apologize.

86
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:36,029
I just wanted to sweep you off your feet.

87
00:05:39,562 --> 00:05:42,125
- Will you come with me to Locksley?
- Why?

88
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:43,844
There 's something you should see.

89
00:05:53,295 --> 00:05:55,527
- Lady Marian.
- Thornton.

90
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,341
Come with me, there 's something
I want to show you.

91
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:06,820
I show you this.

92
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,149
- My wealth.
- Why?

93
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:18,036
Er... I'm not sure what this means.

94
00:06:18,438 --> 00:06:20,396
This means everything.

95
00:06:22,242 --> 00:06:24,599
This means that I am a man of substance.

96
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:27,405
Wealth I can provide for you.

97
00:06:29,448 --> 00:06:31,406
I'm a man of power.

98
00:06:32,131 --> 00:06:34,363
The Sheriff and I, increasingly with Ki...

99
00:06:34,453 --> 00:06:36,571
Prince John.

100
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:43,137
This means that I am a man of lineage.

101
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:48,380
The Gisborne heritage is a proud one.

102
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:55,709
I will be glad to continue that line...

103
00:06:58,315 --> 00:07:00,113
with you...

104
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:03,552
as my wife.

105
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,597
Something has changed.

106
00:07:09,205 --> 00:07:10,560
The King is returning.

107
00:07:40,673 --> 00:07:44,590
Mary! Thomas! Come on! Get on
with it, there 's work to be done.

108
00:07:45,558 --> 00:07:46,709
Roll it.

109
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,757
Come on, help me with this barrel.

110
00:07:48,841 --> 00:07:50,594
Put it over there.

111
00:07:51,925 --> 00:07:55,410
Robin, I don't know what to say, I am sorry.

112
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:56,996
Tell me what you know.

113
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:02,124
Well, the King comes on Saturday, the wedding
takes place on Saturday here at Locksley.

114
00:08:02,213 --> 00:08:05,606
Er, they're going to decorate the church.

115
00:08:05,697 --> 00:08:07,654
I need you to cast your mind back...

116
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,053
to my absence.

117
00:08:11,142 --> 00:08:13,738
Gisborne was unwell, or so he said.

118
00:08:13,824 --> 00:08:17,058
The truth is, he went to the Holy Land
to try to kill the King.

119
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,832
Well, Robin, I'd love to say
that you were right

120
00:08:23,914 --> 00:08:26,555
but he was here.

121
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:29,107
- He was unwell.
- But no one was allowed to see him!

122
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:32,477
- Shh! A fever, a contagion.
- Conta...

123
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:35,982
But the physician came every day.

124
00:08:35,994 --> 00:08:38,563
I cooked the master' s meal every day.

125
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:40,484
The physician took it in to him.

126
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:42,562
- No.
- Who was this physician?

127
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,210
Erm...

128
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:48,252
- Pitts is his name.
- And where does this Pitts live?

129
00:08:48,336 --> 00:08:52,173
In Nottingham now, in Battley Street.

130
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:53,774
But... Robin...

131
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:55,899
This wedding cannot happen.

132
00:09:09,276 --> 00:09:11,967
I would prefer if you
did not visit my house

133
00:09:12,904 --> 00:09:14,142
until it is mine again.

134
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:17,353
Guy wanted to show me my future fortune
as Lady Gisborne.

135
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:24,719
And what? He showed you some trinkets?
Made you agree to go along with the wedding?

136
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,634
You know I have no choice.

137
00:09:26,635 --> 00:09:28,184
I promised to marry
him when the King returned.

138
00:09:28,185 --> 00:09:30,723
- Under duress.
- Yes, under duress.

139
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:33,650
Proving my loyalty to save my life
and my father' s.

140
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:36,516
A promise made under duress
is no promise at all.

141
00:09:36,517 --> 00:09:37,823
And what,

142
00:09:37,997 --> 00:09:41,110
you think I should just back out
and Guy will smile and release me?

143
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:43,865
If he knew I betrayed him,
if he knew I was the Nightwatchman,

144
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:46,668
he would lash out, and not just at me.

145
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,424
At my father.

146
00:09:52,795 --> 00:09:54,674
- Why do you always do this?
- What?

147
00:09:54,757 --> 00:09:56,829
Use your father as an excuse for doing nothing?

148
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:59,560
- Because my father needs me.
- And you need him!

149
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:01,874
Because without him,
you would have to make a choice.

150
00:10:01,963 --> 00:10:05,516
Oh, very well, then, I am making a choice.
I'm choosing to marry Gisborne.

151
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:09,201
Is that what you want me to say?

152
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,362
- I will deal with this.
- How?

153
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:15,508
I will expose him as the liar
and the traitor that he is,

154
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:16,576
then you will not have to marry him.

155
00:10:16,577 --> 00:10:19,114
Robin, please do not make this
more difficult than it is.

156
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:21,457
- You do not love him!
- He has qualities!

157
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:22,467
What qualities?

158
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:24,309
I believe his feelings for me are genuine,

159
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,896
- he has wealth and security...
- What do you mean, wealth?

160
00:10:27,988 --> 00:10:29,661
You're supposed to be the Nightwatchman.

161
00:10:29,749 --> 00:10:33,381
You should steal from Gisborne and give
to the poor, not acquire wealth yourself!

162
00:10:33,473 --> 00:10:35,830
Do not tell me what I should be doing, please.

163
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:37,827
- Robin!
- Look at me.

164
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:39,670
Look at me.

165
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,192
- I will deal with this.
- Robin!

166
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,679
Can't you see that you're upsetting Marian?

167
00:10:57,975 --> 00:11:00,775
I must leave for Merton. Will you be all right?

168
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,373
You have some scheme?

169
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:05,129
The Sheriff has a scheme.

170
00:11:05,676 --> 00:11:08,183
I think he intends to kill the King in Nottingham.

171
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,097
He cannot risk losing the shire.

172
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:16,792
I must act. Merton is loyal to me
and to the King. He will help.

173
00:11:16,872 --> 00:11:18,830
And my marriage...

174
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:21,873
I must go through with it.

175
00:11:22,717 --> 00:11:24,267
A man must...

176
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,998
protect his king.

177
00:11:27,081 --> 00:11:29,200
A man must fight for his king.

178
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:33,161
If could protect you and the King, I would.

179
00:11:33,248 --> 00:11:35,285
I know.

180
00:11:36,891 --> 00:11:38,803
Anyway, I have a plan of my own.

181
00:11:38,893 --> 00:11:41,932
What? The Nightwatchman?

182
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:47,251
One final fling, something to make me feel
more comfortable in my marriage.

183
00:11:52,385 --> 00:11:56,240
You are my world. You know that.

184
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:00,546
I'm marrying a man I do not love.
There are worse things in heaven and earth.

185
00:12:01,747 --> 00:12:05,587
And I am glad and proud...

186
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,476
that you are my father.

187
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:13,754
My wonderful, honorable father.

188
00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:47,468
Battley Street.
Yeah. The physician's.

189
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,272
Master, all clear.

190
00:12:58,118 --> 00:13:01,682
- The physician's on his way.
- Let's see what Pitts has to say

191
00:13:01,683 --> 00:13:04,042
- about Gisborne's illness.
- Aye.

192
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:08,611
I was thinking, we spend our lives skulking,
hiding in shadows.

193
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:11,258
I've grown used to it. Be strange when it's over.

194
00:13:11,338 --> 00:13:14,890
- Hard to imagine.
- Well, soon it will be real.

195
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:17,899
If Gisborne is exposed, Robin will be restored,

196
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,939
and I will have my lodge, my Bonchurch.

197
00:13:21,513 --> 00:13:22,705
Robin.

198
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:26,141
Allan, what will you do?

199
00:13:26,232 --> 00:13:28,144
Me?

200
00:13:28,653 --> 00:13:31,384
Well, live in my lodge.

201
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:33,992
Yeah, you know, servants and that.

202
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,832
- What about you?
- Carpentry, I suppose.

203
00:13:38,202 --> 00:13:39,876
- Wood.
- There 's Pitts.

204
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:11,979
I have nothing of value.

205
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,772
- What was the trick?
- What trick?

206
00:14:13,773 --> 00:14:17,172
You are the physician who treated
Guy of Gisborne at Locksley a year ago?

207
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:18,977
- You're Robin.
- What was the trick?

208
00:14:18,978 --> 00:14:21,837
- There was no trick.
- I see.

209
00:14:22,402 --> 00:14:26,290
So tell me... what illness did he have?

210
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:29,415
Well, difficult to say. Fever, contagion,

211
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,555
- the humors out of balance.
- Do not lie.

212
00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:33,429
My humors are out of balance.

213
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,043
He was very ill, he is lucky to be alive.

214
00:14:36,136 --> 00:14:40,372
I do not have time for this.
You tell me the truth.

215
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:44,092
You're a peace-lover, I have heard.

216
00:14:45,742 --> 00:14:48,022
You will not harm me.

217
00:14:49,992 --> 00:14:53,981
You think you do Gisborne an innocent favor.
You do not.

218
00:14:55,301 --> 00:14:57,957
This is a matter of treason.
Admit your part now,

219
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,896
and when King Richard returns
I will speak for you.

220
00:15:02,886 --> 00:15:05,478
I established a quarantine.

221
00:15:05,563 --> 00:15:09,500
The servants prepared their master' s meals,
I took the meals in to him.

222
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:12,881
I sat there for an hour at a time,
ate the meals myself...

223
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:15,808
brought out empty dishes.

224
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,369
You're a fool.

225
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,206
I meant no harm,
Sir Guy had business in London.

226
00:15:19,207 --> 00:15:21,902
He had business in the Holy Land.

227
00:15:21,903 --> 00:15:23,638
He tried to kill the King.

228
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:25,737
I had no idea.

229
00:15:26,268 --> 00:15:27,819
Forgive me.

230
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:29,548
What can I do?

231
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,018
Master! Soldiers!

232
00:15:32,107 --> 00:15:36,187
I will require you to speak in evidence.

233
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:40,472
- Before the King.
- I, really? Do you think l-I...

234
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:41,675
Yes.

235
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,978
Good decision.

236
00:16:45,896 --> 00:16:47,615
Marian.

237
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:49,451
Marian!

238
00:16:53,382 --> 00:16:56,297
The torches are on but there 's no one home.

239
00:16:56,385 --> 00:16:59,538
Oh, that's like Much.

240
00:16:59,628 --> 00:17:01,586
Yeah, very funny.

241
00:17:02,951 --> 00:17:05,024
- Where is she?
- Maybe she's run away

242
00:17:05,113 --> 00:17:07,993
- to avoid marrying Gisborne.
- Not Marian.

243
00:17:08,076 --> 00:17:10,227
She's not the running kind.

244
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:12,788
Well, let's come back tomorrow.

245
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,838
We can wait.

246
00:17:17,725 --> 00:17:19,638
I know where she is. Quick.

247
00:17:19,726 --> 00:17:22,004
- She's stealing Gisborne's money!
- Oh, good work.

248
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,609
Sir Guy! The Nightwatchman.

249
00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:43,500
Open up.

250
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:45,546
There 's no escape.

251
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:49,671
Get me an ax. You two, outside,
cover the windows in case he jumps.

252
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:16,695
Time to play, Nightwatchman.

253
00:18:22,825 --> 00:18:25,580
Ah, ah, ah! Mind if I join in?

254
00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:29,309
Locksley!

255
00:18:31,713 --> 00:18:33,353
Have you heard the news?

256
00:18:33,434 --> 00:18:35,871
I'm to marry Marian.

257
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:51,647
I will think about you
when I take her to the marriage bed.

258
00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:07,982
Get the money!

259
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:13,426
- I've got it.
- Go, go.

260
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:17,224
Good night, gents.

261
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:21,395
Split up, twos and threes.
You know where to meet.

262
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,611
Gotcha.

263
00:19:48,944 --> 00:19:50,902
What do you think you're doing?

264
00:19:50,986 --> 00:19:53,582
This Nightwatchman business
will be the death of you.

265
00:19:53,668 --> 00:19:55,786
These are my last days as the Nightwatchman.

266
00:19:55,871 --> 00:19:58,261
I will not be able to do it
when I am at Locksley.

267
00:19:58,353 --> 00:20:00,345
You do not have to go back to Locksley.

268
00:20:00,435 --> 00:20:03,156
I told you. You do not have to marry him.

269
00:20:03,237 --> 00:20:05,355
- I have no choice.
- No.

270
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:10,083
I was coming to tell you
I have the proof I need.

271
00:20:10,163 --> 00:20:12,805
The physician, the physician will talk.

272
00:20:12,886 --> 00:20:15,469
I found him and he agreed to give evidence.

273
00:20:15,677 --> 00:20:17,459
He did not treat Gisborne.

274
00:20:17,494 --> 00:20:19,346
Gisborne was not there.

275
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:23,533
- He was in the Holy Land.
- And he will say this in public?

276
00:20:25,738 --> 00:20:28,095
Really?

277
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,137
Thank you.

278
00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:32,294
I do not know how to thank you.

279
00:20:32,384 --> 00:20:34,580
We'll think of something.

280
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:36,795
Come on.

281
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:45,474
Robin...

282
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,280
Marian?

283
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,962
No sign of anyone.

284
00:21:03,052 --> 00:21:07,334
I don't understand. Where are they?

285
00:21:09,898 --> 00:21:11,458
John!

286
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:14,979
John!

287
00:21:24,312 --> 00:21:26,953
I've got her. I've got her.

288
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,754
All right, all right.

289
00:21:28,835 --> 00:21:30,395
- Gisborne stabbed her.
- What?

290
00:21:30,477 --> 00:21:32,549
- In the belly.
- It is a shallow wound,

291
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,438
not serious.

292
00:21:36,242 --> 00:21:40,239
We need dry bedding.
She needs to get dry.

293
00:21:40,326 --> 00:21:42,922
- Get a light.
- Here.

294
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:45,081
John. John!

295
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,967
I need clean water to wash the wound.

296
00:21:50,055 --> 00:21:52,492
Here, here.

297
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:55,859
- Do you have wine?
- A little.

298
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,979
- For the pain.
- Yes.

299
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:05,985
This is not long. What did he use?

300
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,823
I don't know.

301
00:22:07,912 --> 00:22:09,631
- I thought he punched her.
- A dagger.

302
00:22:12,476 --> 00:22:14,115
Can you feel this?

303
00:22:14,197 --> 00:22:16,111
Should you be pressing there?

304
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:18,477
I need to look inside. Wine.

305
00:22:18,562 --> 00:22:20,120
Here.

306
00:22:22,445 --> 00:22:24,483
This will hurt. Are you brave?

307
00:22:25,768 --> 00:22:27,169
Do it.

308
00:22:28,971 --> 00:22:31,647
Keep breathing.

309
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:36,571
- Good.
- She will be all right?

310
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:42,019
I need to sew. Give me a needle.

311
00:22:45,987 --> 00:22:49,141
This needle is thick and blunt.

312
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,463
- Are you prepared?
- Is this the way you sell it?

313
00:22:53,554 --> 00:22:55,432
Give it to me.

314
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:02,921
Ah!

315
00:23:05,765 --> 00:23:10,001
Ho, ho, ho! Look at this! This is great stuff.

316
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,524
The others will be waiting for us.

317
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:14,729
Yeah.

318
00:23:15,814 --> 00:23:18,011
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

319
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,488
No.

320
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:21,119
If you're not thinking it,
how do you know?

321
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,699
I don't think like you do.

322
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,772
I'm not being funny, maybe you should.

323
00:23:25,354 --> 00:23:27,971
What, you think Robin's gonna
need us when he's a lord again?

324
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,476
Yeah?

325
00:23:29,547 --> 00:23:31,100
It's all right for them, innit?
Much with his lodge.

326
00:23:31,101 --> 00:23:32,859
What are we gonna have?

327
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,266
- This should go to the poor.
- That's us now.

328
00:23:37,337 --> 00:23:40,953
Look, we were outlaws, right? We had a job.

329
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:43,599
We've got nothing now, we are the poor.

330
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:47,923
- You know what this is?
- What?

331
00:23:48,004 --> 00:23:49,837
Severance pay.

332
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:54,406
- All right?
- Yes, thank you, Djaq.

333
00:23:54,489 --> 00:23:57,006
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

334
00:23:57,092 --> 00:23:59,562
I did not think you would be so brave.

335
00:24:12,687 --> 00:24:15,268
- Any sign of Allan or Will?
- No.

336
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:21,623
Well, the bad news is you've been stabbed.

337
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,597
But the good news is you don't have
to marry the man that stabbed you.

338
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,595
- And what will happen?
- When the King comes to Nottingham...

339
00:24:29,683 --> 00:24:31,242
I'll make an entrance.

340
00:24:31,324 --> 00:24:33,920
He will let me speak, he trusts me.

341
00:24:34,007 --> 00:24:36,762
I will present the evidence,
the physician will corroborate it,

342
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:39,844
and... and Gisborne will be done for.

343
00:24:39,932 --> 00:24:41,446
Will he hang?

344
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:44,375
Yes.

345
00:24:45,557 --> 00:24:49,269
Marian, this is a man
who would force you to marry him.

346
00:24:49,361 --> 00:24:51,831
A man who tried to kill the King,
a man who stabbed you.

347
00:24:51,922 --> 00:24:54,720
Even so, I will never support hanging.

348
00:24:57,007 --> 00:24:58,761
What?

349
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,168
No, tell me.

350
00:25:06,456 --> 00:25:08,494
I think you feel for him.

351
00:25:08,578 --> 00:25:10,137
He's a human being.

352
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,973
Hardly.

353
00:25:12,742 --> 00:25:15,338
- You are stirred by him.
- Stirred?

354
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:18,945
He said it.

355
00:25:19,027 --> 00:25:21,259
- And he was right, wasn't he?
- Grow up.

356
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:24,868
Well, this morning when you thought
you had to marry him,

357
00:25:24,954 --> 00:25:27,470
you were happily resigned to your fate.

358
00:25:28,556 --> 00:25:32,553
His... qualities and his genuine feelings.

359
00:25:32,641 --> 00:25:35,794
- I was trying to be brave.
- But why?

360
00:25:35,883 --> 00:25:39,960
- This whole Nightwatchman thing, it's...
- What whole Nightwatchman thing?

361
00:25:40,047 --> 00:25:43,122
I am only doing what you do
but with more intelligence.

362
00:25:45,932 --> 00:25:48,495
You would have thought
you would have learnt by now.

363
00:25:48,575 --> 00:25:52,811
Every time you go out,
you get arrested or stabbed or betrothed.

364
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,181
You should stay at home
and do your embroidery.

365
00:26:06,071 --> 00:26:07,604
I did not mean that.

366
00:26:07,605 --> 00:26:10,334
Even my father,
who is old and infirm,

367
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,988
and has a lot more to lose than you do,
even he supports me more than you do.

368
00:26:14,078 --> 00:26:16,719
- Ah!
- Marian, you need to sleep.

369
00:26:30,854 --> 00:26:32,713
You think Marian'll want anything to eat?

370
00:26:32,783 --> 00:26:34,136
What is it girls eat?

371
00:26:34,137 --> 00:26:36,209
Special girls ' food.

372
00:26:37,422 --> 00:26:38,949
You know what I mean.

373
00:26:39,157 --> 00:26:41,663
Ask her yourself what she wants to eat.

374
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:42,993
She's still asleep.

375
00:26:43,051 --> 00:26:45,759
I gave her a nudge earlier
but she didn't wake up.

376
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:48,147
Really?

377
00:26:48,831 --> 00:26:50,584
Still?

378
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,998
Marian. Wake up.

379
00:27:01,082 --> 00:27:02,960
You said to let her sleep.

380
00:27:03,044 --> 00:27:06,516
This is not sleeping.
This is her body shutting down.

381
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:09,385
Gisborne's knife
caused damage inside.

382
00:27:09,386 --> 00:27:10,519
I must open the wound.

383
00:27:10,739 --> 00:27:12,892
Marian! Marian!

384
00:27:15,414 --> 00:27:17,247
I don't feel well.

385
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:21,416
- I need clean instruments.
- What instruments?

386
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,540
You stay here. Hold her hand. I'll be quick.

387
00:27:25,304 --> 00:27:27,136
Do not let her sleep.

388
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,945
- Marian.
- Mm...

389
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:31,986
- Marian.
- Mm-hm.

390
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:34,511
Marian.

391
00:27:39,717 --> 00:27:42,392
- She awake?
- Only just.

392
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,442
Now, does she want an egg
or does she want some bacon?

393
00:27:46,523 --> 00:27:48,881
She can't have both, I don't care who she is.

394
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:51,961
Pray to your god, and to mine.

395
00:27:52,048 --> 00:27:53,368
She is going to die.

396
00:27:56,293 --> 00:27:57,881
Die? What do you mean, die?

397
00:27:57,882 --> 00:27:59,039
Her face.

398
00:28:00,176 --> 00:28:02,851
I have seen that look a thousand times before.

399
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:09,541
W-W-What do we do?

400
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:11,373
I need hot water.

401
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,509
I need clean instruments. Knives.

402
00:28:14,682 --> 00:28:16,746
- Yes, er...
- And here.

403
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:19,301
Grind this into a fine paste. Now.

404
00:28:19,394 --> 00:28:21,307
Yes. Er, er, now.

405
00:28:22,596 --> 00:28:26,309
I should go home. My father will be worried.

406
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,438
All in good time.

407
00:28:28,522 --> 00:28:31,596
- I am a nuisance.
- Yes, you are.

408
00:28:31,685 --> 00:28:33,643
You were supposed to say no.

409
00:28:33,727 --> 00:28:36,004
And you should be at home
doing your embroidery.

410
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,243
Right, here is the paste,

411
00:28:39,332 --> 00:28:42,327
and, er, the instruments are coming,

412
00:28:42,414 --> 00:28:44,612
and, er, Djaq is...

413
00:28:45,297 --> 00:28:47,369
Djaq is, er, coming, and I'm...

414
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,019
I'm sure... I'm sure of...

415
00:28:49,101 --> 00:28:51,094
I'm sure, I'm sure?

416
00:28:51,183 --> 00:28:52,583
I am sure.

417
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,739
"I am sure" is reassuring.

418
00:28:55,827 --> 00:28:58,503
"I am sure, I am sure" is not.

419
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:00,547
I am sure.

420
00:29:00,632 --> 00:29:04,708
It's just, er, Djaq is, er, very... er...

421
00:29:04,795 --> 00:29:07,107
Djaq is very what?

422
00:29:07,197 --> 00:29:09,316
- I'll shut up.
- Good idea.

423
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:11,154
Yeah. I'll go.

424
00:29:12,802 --> 00:29:15,114
Er... drink this.

425
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:17,003
All of it.

426
00:29:19,608 --> 00:29:21,090
Much.

427
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,128
He means well.

428
00:29:24,213 --> 00:29:26,775
What can Djaq have told him?

429
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,971
This is not good, is it?

430
00:29:34,582 --> 00:29:37,418
Tell me the truth.

431
00:29:38,386 --> 00:29:40,299
Maybe not so good.

432
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,229
Here.

433
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,393
I will cut you open.

434
00:29:55,522 --> 00:29:57,754
If I can find the damage, I will sew it up.

435
00:29:59,606 --> 00:30:02,759
- What are my chances?
- If I do not do this, none.

436
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:04,762
If I do, very little.

437
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,855
My father treated the wounded
in the battlefield.

438
00:30:12,658 --> 00:30:16,290
He said never lie to a wounded man.

439
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,137
Or was it never lie to a dying man?

440
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:23,098
He said that too.

441
00:30:30,354 --> 00:30:32,312
So?

442
00:30:32,395 --> 00:30:34,228
Never lie to a dying man.

443
00:30:34,317 --> 00:30:36,275
You are not going to die.

444
00:30:37,521 --> 00:30:41,039
- And I have never lied to you.
- Oh, come on.

445
00:30:41,124 --> 00:30:43,594
We have never once spoken the truth
to each other.

446
00:30:43,686 --> 00:30:45,565
Now is not the time to argue.

447
00:30:45,648 --> 00:30:48,484
Do not tell me when it is the time to argue.

448
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:51,371
What?

449
00:30:51,454 --> 00:30:53,572
Well, I do not think
there can be much wrong with you.

450
00:30:53,655 --> 00:30:55,613
I am serious.

451
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:00,933
We have never once
spoken the truth to each other.

452
00:31:01,022 --> 00:31:04,097
For instance, I call you a fool
when I mean you are a hero.

453
00:31:05,343 --> 00:31:06,731
I criticize your actions...

454
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:09,613
and then mimic them
myself as the Nightwatchman.

455
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:13,819
- I chastise Robin Hood...
- Shh.

456
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,955
I will not be shushed,
these might be my last words.

457
00:31:18,518 --> 00:31:20,476
No, they will not be, they cannot be.

458
00:31:24,323 --> 00:31:26,476
Because we should be together.

459
00:31:26,566 --> 00:31:29,401
I should never have left you,
I should never have gone to war.

460
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:31,321
It was a mistake.

461
00:31:32,411 --> 00:31:34,368
And you were right.

462
00:31:35,013 --> 00:31:36,971
I wanted glory.

463
00:31:37,816 --> 00:31:40,093
But believe me...

464
00:31:40,178 --> 00:31:42,615
the battlefield is the last place you will find it.

465
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,057
You would have always regretted it
if you hadn't gone.

466
00:31:45,143 --> 00:31:47,100
But not as much as I regret going.

467
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,505
Not as much as I regret losing you.

468
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,148
Marian. I should not have gone.

469
00:31:57,114 --> 00:31:58,103
Robin...

470
00:31:58,195 --> 00:32:02,192
I love you, you love me,
we all love each other.

471
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:04,032
Drink the wine.

472
00:32:10,086 --> 00:32:12,123
Here, lift.

473
00:32:15,011 --> 00:32:16,570
Robin, hold her.

474
00:32:24,699 --> 00:32:27,057
It's too...

475
00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:29,274
Master?

476
00:32:29,275 --> 00:32:31,912
Can't reach it without
causing further damage.

477
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:34,906
- Master.
- Robin, press here. Stop the bleeding.

478
00:32:40,714 --> 00:32:42,717
- I cannot!
- What?

479
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,348
I am not trained,

480
00:32:44,349 --> 00:32:46,685
I don't have the right instruments,
I can't do it.

481
00:32:46,686 --> 00:32:48,997
- Much, put your finger here.
- Me?

482
00:32:49,082 --> 00:32:51,040
Yes, you. Come on.

483
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,877
- I need to get the physician.
- There is no time.

484
00:32:57,129 --> 00:32:59,646
- Make me time.
- Be quick.

485
00:32:59,731 --> 00:33:01,689
- Here?
- Yes!

486
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:12,013
Yeah, this is it.

487
00:33:12,944 --> 00:33:15,506
The Great North Road.

488
00:33:17,027 --> 00:33:20,819
So which way are we gonna go?
Back to the cave, or pastures new?

489
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:23,225
What if they need our help, the others?

490
00:33:23,226 --> 00:33:24,498
What for?

491
00:33:24,594 --> 00:33:26,268
They got away.

492
00:33:27,557 --> 00:33:30,791
Where 'd your old man go, and your brother,
when they ran away?

493
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,034
Scarborough. My Auntie Annie.

494
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:38,042
Well.

495
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,812
I wouldn't mind meeting your Auntie Annie.

496
00:33:44,893 --> 00:33:47,011
What do you reckon?

497
00:33:47,095 --> 00:33:49,052
You know what I was thinking?

498
00:33:49,657 --> 00:33:51,536
I was thinking Robin would want this for us.

499
00:33:51,619 --> 00:33:53,577
He would. He'd want the best for us.

500
00:34:20,846 --> 00:34:24,239
Pitts. Pitts!

501
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,207
Yes, yes, what is it?

502
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:30,844
I need your help.
A friend of mine has been stabbed. She...

503
00:34:31,616 --> 00:34:34,087
- She is close to death.
- Bring her here.

504
00:34:34,178 --> 00:34:35,620
I cannot.

505
00:34:35,621 --> 00:34:37,657
I will take you to her.
I have brought you a horse.

506
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,443
Well, where is she?

507
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:41,012
I need to know in case anybody...

508
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:43,103
We must leave now, there is no time.

509
00:34:43,186 --> 00:34:45,383
All right. Let me get my things.

510
00:34:51,034 --> 00:34:53,470
- Hurry up.
- Don't worry, my friend.

511
00:34:53,556 --> 00:34:55,514
Everything is under control.

512
00:35:09,331 --> 00:35:11,289
Hurry. Come on!

513
00:35:15,936 --> 00:35:17,894
Hurry up.

514
00:35:21,222 --> 00:35:23,179
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

515
00:35:26,827 --> 00:35:28,227
Bandages.

516
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,390
All right.

517
00:35:32,472 --> 00:35:34,829
Let's see. Yes, yes.

518
00:35:46,086 --> 00:35:48,264
I'm not doing anything,
I'm just pressing, right?

519
00:35:48,495 --> 00:35:51,006
Yes. There 's not much else we can do.

520
00:35:51,214 --> 00:35:53,529
The physician has the instruments.

521
00:35:53,598 --> 00:35:55,426
Should I be able to feel a heartbeat?

522
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:57,058
Yes.

523
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:13,603
- What are you doing? You'll hurt her.
- Trust me, Much.

524
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:16,104
Where she is, she cannot feel a thing.

525
00:36:27,608 --> 00:36:29,541
Oh, come on, come on, Marian.

526
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,305
Yes, yes!

527
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:48,254
Allah be praised!

528
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:51,725
- Allah be praised!
- Allah be praised!

529
00:36:51,726 --> 00:36:54,705
- How did you do that?
- Put your finger back in. Now!

530
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,828
This will happen again.

531
00:36:57,829 --> 00:36:59,947
Where is the physician?
I cannot do it.

532
00:37:00,193 --> 00:37:01,798
Djaq, Djaq!

533
00:37:02,585 --> 00:37:03,361
Djaq!

534
00:37:05,438 --> 00:37:07,191
Much! John!

535
00:37:09,722 --> 00:37:12,079
- How is she?
- Alive.

536
00:37:17,129 --> 00:37:19,087
You have to save her.

537
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:22,606
Science is advanced but...

538
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,551
we're always in the hands of the Lord.

539
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:28,098
Here. You give her this.

540
00:37:28,178 --> 00:37:31,467
It's a draught for the surgery.
Put a little on her tongue.

541
00:37:37,287 --> 00:37:39,742
She has a dagger wound near the liver,

542
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:42,107
a leaking blood vessel, I have sewn it up.

543
00:37:42,192 --> 00:37:44,025
- You've been trained?
- A little.

544
00:37:44,113 --> 00:37:48,069
Good, good. Then you've probably saved her life.

545
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:49,955
She has saved her life.

546
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:55,555
If you agree, I can close up the wound.

547
00:37:55,644 --> 00:37:57,204
Very good. Close away.

548
00:37:58,206 --> 00:38:00,199
Do you have clean needle?

549
00:38:00,288 --> 00:38:02,167
Thread? Cloth?

550
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,571
Oh. Yes.

551
00:38:21,228 --> 00:38:22,981
Excuse me.

552
00:39:25,807 --> 00:39:27,481
What have I done?

553
00:39:34,535 --> 00:39:38,247
Much! John! Your weapons, now!

554
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:39,929
Why?

555
00:39:40,137 --> 00:39:41,792
Unless I am badly mistaken,

556
00:39:41,793 --> 00:39:44,118
the Sheriff and Gisborne
will arrive at any moment.

557
00:39:44,303 --> 00:39:45,684
We'll be surrounded.

558
00:39:46,328 --> 00:39:48,234
What? We've gotta run!

559
00:39:48,373 --> 00:39:50,283
We cannot run. I cannot run!

560
00:39:51,243 --> 00:39:55,225
- Marian.
- We do not run.

561
00:39:55,971 --> 00:39:57,664
We are trapped in a
cave and surrounded.

562
00:39:57,665 --> 00:39:59,296
We're all gonna die.

563
00:39:59,434 --> 00:40:00,572
Yes.

564
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:02,432
Oh, Lord.

565
00:40:10,828 --> 00:40:14,029
Allan. Where is Allan?

566
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:16,674
And Will! Where are they?

567
00:40:19,396 --> 00:40:22,101
I thought if I survived the Holy Land

568
00:40:22,194 --> 00:40:24,903
then I would die by the fire in Locksley,

569
00:40:24,984 --> 00:40:27,507
not in some... forest

570
00:40:27,611 --> 00:40:30,716
in some... poxy, poxy...

571
00:40:30,743 --> 00:40:32,270
- cave!
- Much!

572
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:34,041
- What?
- Let me think!

573
00:40:39,735 --> 00:40:41,215
You.

574
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:44,215
What did you think?

575
00:40:44,299 --> 00:40:45,912
That Gisborne did not tell me

576
00:40:45,913 --> 00:40:48,389
that one day somebody
might come asking about his alibi?

577
00:40:48,423 --> 00:40:52,106
That we did not have a plan in place
for just this occasion?

578
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:55,585
The charade is over.

579
00:41:00,009 --> 00:41:01,991
Your friend is dead.

580
00:41:03,342 --> 00:41:04,893
Dead?

581
00:41:05,217 --> 00:41:06,605
Dead.

582
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:22,367
Robin.

583
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:26,556
I'm sorry.

584
00:42:14,342 --> 00:42:15,742
Marian.

585
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:19,225
Marian!

586
00:42:27,955 --> 00:42:29,708
Marian.

587
00:42:32,078 --> 00:42:34,036
I love you.

588
00:42:37,141 --> 00:42:38,801
I should have said.

589
00:42:40,566 --> 00:42:42,747
Why did I not say?

590
00:42:46,212 --> 00:42:47,965
I love you.

591
00:42:48,267 --> 00:42:50,126
Marian.

592
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:52,173
I love you.

593
00:42:58,423 --> 00:43:00,302
Marian.

594
00:43:16,558 --> 00:43:18,502
Robin!

595
00:43:18,525 --> 00:43:23,590
Robin! Come out, come out, wherever you are!
