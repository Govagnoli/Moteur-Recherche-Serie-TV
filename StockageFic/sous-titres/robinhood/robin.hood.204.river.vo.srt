1
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,640
This is an ambush!

2
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:20,440
A little of what you have could
be a lot for the poor of Nottingham!

3
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,821
- We are the poor!
- Let them take what they need, Lukey.

4
00:01:26,417 --> 00:01:27,222
Dad?

5
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:29,990
- Dad!
- It's me!

6
00:01:38,802 --> 00:01:40,359
Will, you know these people?

7
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:42,979
I'd like you to meet
my father Dan Scarlett

8
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,296
and my little brother Lukey.

9
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:48,399
- I'm not little!
- My big little brother, Lukey.

10
00:02:32,632 --> 00:02:35,645
- So what brings you back to Nottingham?
- We've come to take Will

11
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:38,022
- back to Scarborough with us.
- What?

12
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,719
How about asking me if I want to come?

13
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:44,139
We're your family.
Your Auntie Annie and us.

14
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:47,778
- I've got a family here too, Dad.
- We were sure you'd come and find us.

15
00:02:47,898 --> 00:02:50,045
- Didn't you miss us?
- Yes. But...

16
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:53,238
I'm with Robin now.

17
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,388
"I'm with Robin now"?!

18
00:02:57,241 --> 00:03:00,239
Son, you've got
your whole life ahead of you.

19
00:03:13,964 --> 00:03:15,110
What's that?

20
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,457
It's a letter.

21
00:03:17,688 --> 00:03:19,065
Yeah, to who?

22
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,103
It's to the King.

23
00:03:21,818 --> 00:03:24,368
- What about?
- The Sheriff and the Black Knights.

24
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:26,599
- Who's delivering it?
- An old friend.

25
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:29,719
Roger of Stoke.

26
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:30,985
Roger.

27
00:03:34,135 --> 00:03:36,954
- Where are you meeting him?
- How many questions have you got Allan?

28
00:03:37,074 --> 00:03:38,990
All right! I'm just curious.

29
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,515
I'm meeting him in Nottingham
after the money drop.

30
00:03:45,155 --> 00:03:47,480
- This craftsmanship is good.
- See?

31
00:03:48,293 --> 00:03:49,679
I've got a life here.

32
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:53,418
What that says to me, is you could
earn a decent living in Scarborough.

33
00:03:53,538 --> 00:03:56,807
Dad, I'm an outlaw.
I stand up for what I believe in.

34
00:03:56,927 --> 00:03:59,036
- What? And I don't?
- It doesn't matter.

35
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,680
Yes, it does. Tell me.

36
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,315
- You let the Sheriff cut off your hand!
- That was to save me and you!

37
00:04:04,558 --> 00:04:06,599
- I didn't mean that.
- Yes, you did.

38
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:14,040
Robin, can you tell my father I'm a
grown man now. I make my own decisions.

39
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,275
A real man listens to advice, Will.

40
00:04:18,434 --> 00:04:19,599
Thanks, Robin.

41
00:04:19,872 --> 00:04:21,600
But Will does have a life here.

42
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,028
And you should see it before you
take him away from it.

43
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:28,240
Come to Nottingham tomorrow -
Let me show you what we do.

44
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:37,705
Look it's him.
Jess, it is the Nightwatchman.

45
00:04:50,461 --> 00:04:52,653
Let's see, what does he bring?

46
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
God bless you, Nightwatchman.

47
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:03,625
And that night,

48
00:05:04,427 --> 00:05:07,054
the Angel of the Lord
went back and forth...

49
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,775
Ah! The Nightwatchman.

50
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:23,940
So how was your evening's... generosity?

51
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,537
Very satisfying.

52
00:05:25,835 --> 00:05:28,134
They all took the bait, like rats.

53
00:05:31,835 --> 00:05:33,337
Good. Shouldn't you be...

54
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,779
measuring or whatever
it is that you do?

55
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:38,733
- Scientific analysis.
- Right.

56
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:42,000
I am waiting to be accidentally
caught in the quarantine.

57
00:05:43,816 --> 00:05:44,662
Yes...

58
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:47,671
The ermm...

59
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:51,996
Off you go.

60
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:02,800
Please!

61
00:06:03,315 --> 00:06:05,237
Please Jailer, let me see my father!

62
00:06:05,357 --> 00:06:07,616
- Can't be done. I've told you.
- Marian!

63
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:11,378
- I am well.
- I will speak to the Sheriff.

64
00:06:11,498 --> 00:06:13,708
- Do not worry.
- Speak away, my dear.

65
00:06:13,931 --> 00:06:14,882
Sheriff...

66
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:19,849
this punishment hurts my father,
not me.

67
00:06:20,177 --> 00:06:22,600
Oh, I don't know.
I think it hurts you both.

68
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,185
It is efficient.

69
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:27,376
It'll make you think before you
undermine my authority again.

70
00:06:27,496 --> 00:06:30,919
Which, trust me,
is in your best interests.

71
00:06:32,895 --> 00:06:35,378
Please! Please! Sheriff.

72
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:38,240
There must be something I can do. Guy!?

73
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:40,519
It's no good making those big eyes

74
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:42,919
at him, he doesn't want you any more.

75
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:47,504
Tell you what,
you read this announcement for me,

76
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:50,901
and we'll see if we can
get daddy some dinner.

77
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:53,364
You mean you haven't fed him!?

78
00:06:56,602 --> 00:06:57,479
Sheriff?

79
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,171
- Right, time to spread a bit of...
- Happiness?

80
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,290
Happiness! Yes, that's right.

81
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,462
Time to spread a bit of happiness.

82
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:14,576
Bless you...

83
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,649
See, these people need us.

84
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,707
We need you too. You're family.

85
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:22,619
Help me, somebody please, help me!

86
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:24,481
Robin...

87
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:26,877
Robin, help! It's Jess.

88
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,727
She's got something!
I think it's the pestilence!

89
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,601
Will, get Djaq.

90
00:07:35,337 --> 00:07:37,700
There's no swellings.
How long has she been like this?

91
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,310
Just since this morning.

92
00:07:39,997 --> 00:07:41,080
Toot toot...

93
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:51,840
- People of Nottingham.
- Louder.

94
00:07:54,627 --> 00:07:56,574
- People of Nottingham!
- Good.

95
00:07:56,955 --> 00:07:58,679
On behalf of the Sheriff...

96
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,137
I make the following announcement.

97
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
The pestilence has come to Nottingham.

98
00:08:05,492 --> 00:08:07,351
My God, Jess. That's what it is.

99
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:09,275
No, it's not. Do not be afraid.

100
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,240
It is confined to the
houses in Pitt Street.

101
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,997
There will be a quarantine
placed around the street.

102
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,800
No-one is to pass
through without permission.

103
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,036
No-one is to pass food or medicine...

104
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,279
What? There's young ones suffering.

105
00:08:23,518 --> 00:08:25,918
They can't be cut off with nothing.

106
00:08:26,304 --> 00:08:27,448
To do so...

107
00:08:28,326 --> 00:08:31,800
risk is spreading the infection,
and will be punished by death.

108
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:39,006
What are we going to do?
She's going to die!

109
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:41,280
No, she isn't.
That's not what she's got.

110
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,239
Sarah. Take Jess home.

111
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:44,997
Djaq and I will come soon.

112
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:46,719
Be careful.

113
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:49,158
We will not be cowed by this infection.

114
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:51,840
Business will continue as normal.

115
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,928
- <i>Report to the castle for duty...</i>
- What's Marian's game?

116
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:57,719
- She's just doing as she's told.
<i>- ... at the usual hour.</i>

117
00:08:58,845 --> 00:08:59,553
Now,

118
00:09:00,103 --> 00:09:01,836
you may hear cries for help.

119
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:03,397
Please for mercy.

120
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:06,590
Medicine. Help me! Help me! Help me!

121
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:08,556
A word of advice.

122
00:09:14,677 --> 00:09:16,320
Go forth... in peace...

123
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,529
- Robin! We've got to stop him!
- <i>Iove...</i>

124
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:21,920
- He condemns a whole street to death.
- <i>... and serve your Sheriff.</i>

125
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,721
Sheriff! This is not right!

126
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,080
Dan! Dan!

127
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,342
What?

128
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:33,759
I've just had a look at young
lass and it's not the pestilence.

129
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,480
Get that man shut up.

130
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,680
I've seen the pestilence before,
in Scarborough.

131
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:41,599
These people must have
food and water,

132
00:09:42,002 --> 00:09:43,337
and medicines.

133
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,836
I said SHUT UP!

134
00:09:44,956 --> 00:09:47,870
I've shut up for you
once before, Sheriff.

135
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,836
It's cost me my wife,
my hand and the respect of my son.

136
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:53,840
So I'm not shutting up any more.

137
00:09:54,306 --> 00:09:56,439
Now why are you saying
this is the pestilence...

138
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:15,081
Well, done! Hysteria.

139
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,446
Panic.

140
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:20,515
In times of crisis, not very helpful.

141
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:22,603
It will not be tolerated!

142
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,679
Will, you can't go up there!

143
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,512
- I'm going to kill him.
- You heard the Sheriff.

144
00:10:32,634 --> 00:10:34,560
Set up those barricades!

145
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:37,125
- There's too many of them, Will.
- It'd be suicide.

146
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:39,064
- I don't care!
- Will!

147
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:54,099
- We need to go to Pitt Street.
- Pitt Street, why?

148
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,520
There are people there. Our people.

149
00:10:57,871 --> 00:10:59,433
And they need us.

150
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:01,872
- Djaq?
- Of course.

151
00:11:01,992 --> 00:11:04,197
Robin! The pestilence.

152
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:06,426
I'm not sure either, to be honest.

153
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:08,125
I think Dan was right.

154
00:11:08,245 --> 00:11:11,550
There is no pestilence.
That's why the Sheriff killed him.

155
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,951
- You think?!
- No, no! Help

156
00:11:14,361 --> 00:11:16,119
We haven't got time for this.

157
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:18,200
They're setting
the barricades up right now.

158
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,720
<i>Help! Please help us.</i>

159
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,690
Hey listen! I tell you what,
I'll do the letter for whatshisname...

160
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,160
Roger of Stoke.

161
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,419
Good thinking. Here, go on.

162
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,120
The rest of you,
I can't ask you to risk your life.

163
00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:33,143
But if you do come with me,

164
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:35,660
then do it for Dan. Now come on.

165
00:11:39,713 --> 00:11:41,662
Will, Pitt Street, the back way.

166
00:11:41,782 --> 00:11:42,594
Now!

167
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,133
Put your backs into it!

168
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,680
Let me through. I do not live here.

169
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:12,315
I was just only walking this way.
I'm from Leicester.

170
00:12:12,435 --> 00:12:13,706
Sheriff's orders.

171
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:16,808
This has got nothing to do with me!

172
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:18,609
Don't do this!

173
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:21,517
- Don't do this! My Jess needs help!
- Sarah!

174
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:22,927
Robin.

175
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:24,983
Oh, no, you can't be here.

176
00:12:25,103 --> 00:12:27,442
- You'll never get out.
- I said I'd come and find you.

177
00:12:27,562 --> 00:12:31,381
- Take us to your daughter.
- Come on. Let's see what we can do.

178
00:12:44,106 --> 00:12:46,119
She needs water, lots of water.

179
00:12:46,525 --> 00:12:48,675
Are there many other people affected?

180
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,104
Half the houses on the street.

181
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:58,897
Right. I want beds. Clean linens. All...

182
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:01,397
All in one place. Go.

183
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:05,720
And all the herbs and medicines from
every house brought here to Djaq.

184
00:13:07,761 --> 00:13:10,129
Hey, hey. Luke...

185
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:14,000
- Luke. Your dad wouldn't want this.
- How do you know what he'd want?

186
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,295
- We should kill the Sheriff...
- We can't just kill the Sheriff.

187
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:21,125
Prince John would send an army
to destroy Nottingham.

188
00:13:21,245 --> 00:13:23,584
- It would create hell.
- Robin,

189
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:28,719
I want to take him home. To Scarborough.

190
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:30,455
Our Auntie Annie.

191
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:32,857
- If you need us here...
- No.

192
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:38,400
No, take him. And when you return,
we'll honour your father.

193
00:13:39,115 --> 00:13:40,195
Thank you.

194
00:13:52,014 --> 00:13:53,107
Where's Sarah?

195
00:13:53,227 --> 00:13:55,320
Don't you know?
She lives in Pitt Street.

196
00:13:55,582 --> 00:13:56,839
Is she affected?

197
00:13:57,222 --> 00:13:58,280
Little Jess.

198
00:14:01,099 --> 00:14:01,880
Right.

199
00:14:02,762 --> 00:14:04,520
We must get them medicine.

200
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:06,670
And I need your clothes.

201
00:14:11,596 --> 00:14:12,952
I'm sorry, Will.

202
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,705
Me too, Robin.

203
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,998
Really sorry.

215
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,499
We need to take food as well.

204
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,432
No need, Miss. They're all fed.

204
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:18,863
The Nightwatchman visited 
last night, at Pitt Street.

205
00:15:25,873 --> 00:15:27,280
Don't come in.

206
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,313
- Marian?
- You can't come in.

207
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,320
I cannot talk to you through the door.

208
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,804
Well, then you can't talk to me at all.

209
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,966
I just wanted to apologise...

210
00:15:41,086 --> 00:15:43,882
for what happened today...
the way the Sheriff treated you.

211
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:47,647
Am I to perform like a monkey,
whilst my father starves in the dungeon?

212
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:48,480
No...

213
00:15:48,641 --> 00:15:51,106
I will see to it that your father
is properly fed.

214
00:15:51,226 --> 00:15:54,253
Really? And what do you want in return?

215
00:15:55,602 --> 00:15:56,544
Nothing.

216
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,280
You have my word.

217
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,880
Then thank you.

218
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,781
Marian, please...

219
00:16:06,046 --> 00:16:07,080
Let me in.

220
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,522
- The Nightwatchman went to Pitt Street?
- Yes.

221
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:23,520
Hello?

222
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:27,474
It's Robin Hood. Do you have any
medicines or herbs you could give me?

223
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:31,679
Robin, please go away. We have the
pestilence here, save yourself.

224
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:40,648
- What are you doing?
- I'm helping the sick.

225
00:16:40,768 --> 00:16:42,160
Leave them alone!

226
00:16:44,101 --> 00:16:46,480
I mean... You could die.

227
00:16:47,564 --> 00:16:49,831
That's a risk I take every day.

228
00:16:51,914 --> 00:16:54,322
No, you're right, forgive me.

229
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:56,601
Let me help.

230
00:16:58,088 --> 00:16:59,726
- What's your name?
- Joseph.

231
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:01,760
I'm here by mistake.

232
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,884
You're from Leicester, I heard.

233
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,680
Did you see the way
those men treated me? Godless.

234
00:17:07,905 --> 00:17:09,620
Welcome to Nottingham.

235
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,687
Robin?

236
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,933
These men are with me.
Can you help them?

237
00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:23,905
- These people are burning up!
- You know,

238
00:17:24,138 --> 00:17:28,039
perhaps it would be a kindness just not
to interfere, not prolong their pain.

239
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:33,000
This is a medicine chest!
Every medicine known to man.

240
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:34,920
And some unknown.

241
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,540
- Oh, don't do that!
- Why not?

242
00:17:38,795 --> 00:17:40,721
I'm a man, you're a woman.

243
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:43,945
- I fall in love very easily.
- Don't worry, I don't.

244
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:56,554
Let me get down first,
make sure it's safe.

245
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:58,702
I know what to look for,
better than you do.

246
00:17:58,822 --> 00:18:01,080
Why do you always
treat me like I'm a baby?

247
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:16,199
I loved you, Luke.

248
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:19,280
See? Your turn.

249
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,799
- Will?
- Run away, Luke.

250
00:18:25,961 --> 00:18:27,519
Run back to Scarborough.

251
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:31,520
This place is about to turn into hell.

252
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,454
Will?

253
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:35,410
Will! Will!

254
00:18:42,866 --> 00:18:46,051
- She'll not die, will she?
- Not if I can help it.

255
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:48,339
And you are from the fourth house
on the street?

256
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:51,239
And your husband ate a large
pie last night, nothing since?

257
00:18:51,402 --> 00:18:52,960
That's right.

258
00:18:54,575 --> 00:18:56,311
- Good.
- Good?

259
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:03,759
She is hotter.
Look at the cheeks, the lips.

260
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:05,923
- Are you trained in medicine?
- Me?

261
00:19:06,043 --> 00:19:08,134
No. I'm just...

262
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:10,958
just hoping this poor child recovers.

263
00:19:14,645 --> 00:19:15,715
Don't go!

264
00:19:40,504 --> 00:19:42,463
Stand, or you're dead.

265
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:13,271
- A shame.
- A shame?

266
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:19,563
It's an outrage.
That's another life wasted.

267
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,085
- You suspect foul play?
- Joseph...

268
00:20:22,205 --> 00:20:24,319
Joseph, this is Nottingham.

269
00:20:24,517 --> 00:20:26,795
There is no other kind of play!

270
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,999
Will, you scared me!

271
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:40,160
What are you doing here, do you
have a message from Robin?

272
00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:41,881
Will.

273
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:44,031
Will?

274
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:50,950
So...

275
00:20:52,193 --> 00:20:55,773
You're all from different families
and you haven't eaten together...

276
00:20:56,345 --> 00:20:58,262
We've all eaten the pies though.

277
00:20:58,802 --> 00:21:00,087
Our Jess ate ours.

278
00:21:00,207 --> 00:21:02,166
- How much did she have?
- What pies?

279
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,537
The Nightwatchman's.

280
00:21:05,728 --> 00:21:08,170
He brought them all last night.
Every house in the street.

281
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,160
Soup. I'll make everybody some soup.

282
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,240
They're all dropping
like flies, my Lord.

283
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:19,760
The poison's lethal! Can't let it fall
into the wrong hands, eh?

284
00:21:22,745 --> 00:21:24,963
I'm thinking of getting
a food taster, Gisborne...

285
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,255
with all this tasteless poison around.

286
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:31,394
- What do you think?
- Good idea.

287
00:21:34,847 --> 00:21:37,632
Maybe I'll eat half an hour
after you do.

288
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:21,145
What have you got for me?

289
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:26,311
What's the matter?

290
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,050
A conscience?

291
00:22:32,611 --> 00:22:34,351
How much for this?

292
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:35,880
It depends what this is.

293
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,980
This is a letter to King Richard
from Robin.

294
00:22:39,455 --> 00:22:42,929
Telling him all about you and
the Sheriff and the Black Knights.

295
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,800
Game will be ugly, Gisborne.

296
00:22:46,961 --> 00:22:48,000
Give me that.

297
00:22:48,707 --> 00:22:51,783
I can't. I told Robin I'd give it
to Roger of Stoke,

298
00:22:52,173 --> 00:22:55,160
- who's coming to take it to the King.
- So what's your proposal?

299
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:57,470
I'll give it to him, then I'm clean.

300
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:00,293
You can arrest him after I've gone,
somewhere out of town.

301
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:02,080
I don't know anything about it.

302
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:05,760
Good, you're learning,

303
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:07,570
Allan.

304
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:17,442
Hey. Stop!

305
00:23:18,806 --> 00:23:20,236
I have seen you!

306
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,525
No, you haven't.

307
00:23:30,102 --> 00:23:32,249
You should come and eat.
Keep our strength up.

308
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,564
- All right.
- Thanks, Joseph.

309
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:36,883
Robin!

310
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:40,399
- Marian. What are you doing here?
- Someone's impersonating me.

311
00:23:40,778 --> 00:23:41,743
I know.

312
00:23:42,445 --> 00:23:45,220
- I think he's given out poisoned pies.
- What?

313
00:23:45,516 --> 00:23:48,354
- In my name?!
- It's the Sheriff's doing.

314
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,862
- But why?
- No idea.

315
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,493
He wants to damage the
Nightwatchman's reputation?

316
00:23:53,613 --> 00:23:56,086
Then he'd blame him. And he hasn't.

317
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:07,835
I need to see if Jess is all right.

318
00:24:48,701 --> 00:24:49,908
Smells good.

319
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:51,846
Are you a cook?

320
00:24:52,596 --> 00:24:55,445
- No, I'm a man of science.
- What sort of science?

321
00:24:58,628 --> 00:25:00,623
The science of elimination.

322
00:25:00,743 --> 00:25:03,480
- What's that?
- Finding ways to get rid of dirt.

323
00:25:03,841 --> 00:25:05,977
Have you noticed,
there's dirt everywhere?

324
00:25:06,097 --> 00:25:07,560
We have to get rid of it.

325
00:25:07,847 --> 00:25:11,067
And there are people who will make
the necessary difficult decisions.

326
00:25:11,187 --> 00:25:13,279
Who don't need to be popular.

327
00:25:13,441 --> 00:25:16,599
You need to talk to the Sheriff.
He doesn't need to be popular.

328
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:19,801
With the right tool,
we can clean this country,

329
00:25:20,595 --> 00:25:22,321
create a new England.

330
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:29,866
You should definitely
talk to the Sheriff.

331
00:25:37,048 --> 00:25:37,790
Food!

332
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,072
Food.

333
00:25:43,321 --> 00:25:44,480
I'll take over.

334
00:25:55,629 --> 00:25:56,928
You organised this?

335
00:25:57,048 --> 00:25:58,800
We had hospitals in the Holy Land.

336
00:26:00,505 --> 00:26:02,719
I thought it'd be
the last time I'd see them.

337
00:26:02,881 --> 00:26:05,913
How did you know there wasn't
some infectious disease?

338
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,720
I didn't.

339
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:09,480
That's brave.

340
00:26:11,882 --> 00:26:13,159
How did you know?

341
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,279
I didn't.

342
00:26:16,978 --> 00:26:18,461
Robin? Are you eating?

343
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:22,120
- In a moment. The others can start.
- No! I need you!

344
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,560
I mean... you should eat.

345
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:30,107
I'll be there in a moment.

346
00:26:33,248 --> 00:26:35,384
Robin! Robin! I know that man.

347
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,799
I have seen him before in the castle!

348
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:40,607
He's advising the Sheriff.

349
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,778
And the Lord said, "Take, eat,"

350
00:26:45,347 --> 00:26:47,116
"do this in memory of me".

351
00:26:47,886 --> 00:26:50,040
You make it sound like the Last Supper!

352
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,120
- Robin!
- This is the last supper...

353
00:26:57,698 --> 00:27:00,738
- for you, Joseph.
- You poison people,

354
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,279
then keep a record of their suffering!

355
00:27:04,194 --> 00:27:06,620
What? That is revolting!

356
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,520
My poison has no taste...

357
00:27:08,766 --> 00:27:11,800
no colour, no odour.
It's a beautiful thing.

358
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,325
What's the cure for the poison?

359
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,437
There are people out there dying!

360
00:27:22,221 --> 00:27:23,291
Children!

361
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,775
It's made from an extract
of the amanita mushroom.

362
00:27:28,326 --> 00:27:29,882
The Angel of Death.

363
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:33,120
The Devil's Cap.

364
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,399
There is no cure!

365
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,359
- <i>Stop him!</i>
- Open the gate!

366
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,016
<i>Stop him!</i>

367
00:27:49,407 --> 00:27:51,600
It's me! Let me through, it's me!

368
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,080
<i>Stop him!</i>

369
00:28:04,655 --> 00:28:06,440
- They knew him!
- He tricked us.

370
00:28:06,941 --> 00:28:08,440
- Clever.
- Clever?

371
00:28:08,934 --> 00:28:11,760
He nearly poisoned us.
What about these people?

372
00:28:12,612 --> 00:28:13,717
Belladonna.

373
00:28:13,881 --> 00:28:14,960
Bella what?

374
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,240
Belladonna.

375
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,960
- For mushroom poisoning.
- Belladonna is deadly nightshade.

376
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,087
- It is a poison.
- It works.

377
00:28:22,593 --> 00:28:25,771
- Woodsman's remedy.
- A poison to fight a poison.

378
00:28:36,152 --> 00:28:38,360
Djaq? Djaq?
It's Jess, I think she's going.

379
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:45,480
- What's that?
- It's a hunch.

380
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:49,320
- But it could kill her.
- Whose hunch?

381
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:50,825
Mine.

382
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:54,886
Here.

383
00:28:58,825 --> 00:29:00,763
Trust me. Let me do this.

384
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:17,475
She's going anyway.
Just try it, just try it.

385
00:29:29,939 --> 00:29:31,760
Jess! No...

386
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:43,560
No.

387
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:52,247
Jess!

388
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:55,861
It's working! It's working!

389
00:29:57,651 --> 00:29:58,760
I think it is!

390
00:29:59,293 --> 00:30:00,360
It is working.

391
00:30:05,926 --> 00:30:06,911
Amazing!

392
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:10,775
- How did you know that?
- I know some things.

393
00:30:10,895 --> 00:30:13,479
We have to stop Joseph
before he poisons anybody else.

394
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,574
He'll have gone into the castle.
We must find a way to get in after him.

395
00:30:16,694 --> 00:30:19,155
- How did Will get in?
- Will?

396
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,160
He's in the castle.

397
00:30:22,088 --> 00:30:23,280
Didn't you know?

398
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:25,920
Oh, no...

399
00:30:26,496 --> 00:30:29,680
- What's going on?
- He's going to kill the Sheriff.

400
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,239
Doesn't he know Prince John
would destroy Nottingham?

401
00:30:32,401 --> 00:30:35,094
- He knows, but...
- The man the Sheriff killed...

402
00:30:35,974 --> 00:30:37,080
was Will's father.

403
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:52,483
Roger?

404
00:30:53,576 --> 00:30:54,640
Where's Robin?

405
00:30:57,341 --> 00:30:59,840
He couldn't make it.
But he gave me this for you.

406
00:31:01,545 --> 00:31:03,160
- God Save The King.
- Yeah.

407
00:31:03,467 --> 00:31:04,918
And the rest of us.

408
00:31:26,103 --> 00:31:28,422
Success with the pitiful of Pitt Street?

409
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:32,080
Oh, yes. Even those who hardly
touched the food are in agony.

410
00:31:32,368 --> 00:31:36,064
And those who ate the full dose
have begun to die, as I predicted.

411
00:31:37,622 --> 00:31:38,600
Very good.

412
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:41,320
Well done, thank you, goodbye.

413
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:42,831
Pardon?

414
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:45,399
You can go now, back
to wherever it was that you came from.

415
00:31:45,624 --> 00:31:47,133
You'll be paid, don't worry.

416
00:31:47,461 --> 00:31:50,063
But the application of my invention...

417
00:31:50,183 --> 00:31:53,540
To rid the country of the weak
and the dirty, the parasites.

418
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,919
My dear boy,

419
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,120
those are the ones who do
exactly what I tell them to.

420
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,477
We need those.

421
00:31:59,705 --> 00:32:01,667
No. Your poison will be used

422
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:04,400
on the King's army
when they land on the south coast.

423
00:32:04,561 --> 00:32:06,443
But that's not what we agreed.

424
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:08,840
Yes, yes, I know.

425
00:32:09,452 --> 00:32:11,973
And life is usually so much fairer.

426
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,309
Come to Daddy!

427
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:21,696
Nobody passes.

428
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:25,078
Master Joseph asked us
to bring the body to the castle.

429
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,200
- What for?
- He didn't say.

430
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,160
What, d'you want to take it?

431
00:32:41,917 --> 00:32:42,703
Enter!

432
00:32:45,034 --> 00:32:46,973
I will not let you use my poison!

433
00:32:48,979 --> 00:32:51,425
Well, I'm surprised
to hear you say that.

434
00:32:51,715 --> 00:32:52,731
A clue...

435
00:32:53,963 --> 00:32:56,594
Luckily, I managed to commandeer

436
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,926
your meticulous records.

437
00:33:00,175 --> 00:33:02,779
- You used me.
- Yes, I used you.

438
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:09,060
Don't fuss about it. I like you.

439
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:11,437
If I didn't, well

440
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:16,016
I could make you drink
from your own cup, so to speak.

441
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:18,623
So,

442
00:33:18,961 --> 00:33:19,816
chin chin.

443
00:33:22,365 --> 00:33:24,515
Ermmm... You, you... boy,

444
00:33:26,606 --> 00:33:27,962
don't I know you?

445
00:33:28,436 --> 00:33:29,919
You knew my dad, Dan.

446
00:33:30,787 --> 00:33:32,150
He's dead now.

447
00:33:32,404 --> 00:33:33,527
Oh, really?

448
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,714
Well,

449
00:33:35,023 --> 00:33:38,384
here's to your dearly
departed dead dad Dan.

450
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,560
Come along, Joey boy, drink up.

451
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,383
And then get lost -
otherwise I might change my mind.

452
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:52,800
To dead Dan!

453
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:07,880
Raise the gate! Body for Master Joseph!

454
00:34:21,812 --> 00:34:23,919
- What's happening?
- Will's in here.

455
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,882
- And he wants to kill the Sheriff.
- And the Sheriff

456
00:34:28,115 --> 00:34:29,616
has hired a poisoner.

457
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,501
- Did you see Roger of Stoke?
- Yeah. I gave him your letter.

458
00:34:33,621 --> 00:34:34,955
Good. Good work.

459
00:34:38,942 --> 00:34:41,908
John, Allan, you go down that way.

460
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,601
What do we do
if he doesn't come quietly?

461
00:34:45,721 --> 00:34:47,760
- You make him.
- What if he won't?

462
00:34:49,693 --> 00:34:51,256
Whatever it takes, Much.

463
00:34:52,735 --> 00:34:54,079
Whatever it takes?

464
00:34:54,662 --> 00:34:57,640
- Whatever it takes.
- We kill one of our own?

465
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,634
Well, let's hope we have a choice.

466
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,239
Help...

467
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:24,377
- Will.
- Robin...

468
00:35:24,653 --> 00:35:26,540
Help... We were poisoned...

469
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,478
Well,

470
00:35:29,598 --> 00:35:32,679
according to your friend here,
there is no cure.

471
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:33,759
So,

472
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:35,800
you're going to die.

473
00:35:36,082 --> 00:35:38,760
No! I cannot die! I am too young.

474
00:35:42,184 --> 00:35:44,014
I haven't finished yet.

475
00:35:47,633 --> 00:35:51,008
Dan Scarlett hadn't finished either
when you killed him this morning.

476
00:35:51,128 --> 00:35:51,853
Him!

477
00:35:53,165 --> 00:35:55,459
Dead Dan!? The father?

478
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,840
I'm going to die because of
a complete nonentity?

479
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,799
And life is usually so much fairer.

480
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,881
- Why, Sheriff?
- Operation Shah Mat.

481
00:36:08,524 --> 00:36:09,833
The King's Army.

482
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,832
You should approve.
We win without any bloodshed!

483
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,595
Well, you're not winning now, are you?

484
00:36:20,695 --> 00:36:22,760
If, by the slightest chance...

485
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:25,797
I happened to have a cure

486
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,439
would you give up Shah Mat?

487
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:30,287
No. No! And there is no cure!

488
00:36:30,407 --> 00:36:33,480
SHUT UP! Yes. Yes! Yes, Robin.

489
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:35,188
Yes, yes!

490
00:36:35,308 --> 00:36:37,080
- Don't die before I get back.
- No...

491
00:36:42,948 --> 00:36:43,760
Will!

492
00:36:45,223 --> 00:36:47,519
Tell me you haven't done
anything stupid.

493
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,536
- Stupid?
- To the Sheriff.

494
00:36:50,303 --> 00:36:51,550
I haven't touched him.

495
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,360
It's not pestilence, it's a poison.
And we have a cure!

496
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,155
It's Little John's idea!

497
00:36:56,627 --> 00:36:58,684
- That's good.
- You're not happy?

498
00:36:58,899 --> 00:37:00,690
The sick are getting better!

499
00:37:01,745 --> 00:37:03,394
What are you doing?

500
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,319
My dad isn't getting better!

501
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,680
Don't do this...

502
00:37:13,016 --> 00:37:14,191
Where's Djaq?

503
00:37:14,892 --> 00:37:16,056
We split up.

504
00:37:18,712 --> 00:37:20,773
- Will has poisoned the Sheriff.
- What?

505
00:37:20,893 --> 00:37:22,815
And Djaq's got the remedy.

506
00:37:22,935 --> 00:37:23,773
Will!

507
00:37:27,614 --> 00:37:29,045
I know what you've done.

508
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:31,683
I've done the right thing,
that's what I've done.

509
00:37:31,803 --> 00:37:33,320
Justice in a bottle.

510
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,501
- Djaq has the remedy.
- I know. She told me.

511
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:36,840
Where is she, Will?

512
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:40,320
- What have you done with her?
- I've stood up to the Sheriff.

513
00:37:40,819 --> 00:37:43,626
That's what we all should
have done a long time ago.

514
00:37:43,746 --> 00:37:47,200
- Even if all of Nottingham dies?
- That's not my fault.

515
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,680
- No, Master no!
- Robin!

516
00:37:53,226 --> 00:37:55,950
- Robin!
- You want to watch people die,

517
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:59,080
- you can start with me.
- Robin! I can't let the Sheriff live.

518
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,148
- Yes, you can!
- My dad. He did it for me.

519
00:38:02,268 --> 00:38:04,840
He stood up to the Sheriff
to prove himself to me!

520
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,799
Then prove yourself to him.

521
00:38:06,961 --> 00:38:09,616
Show that we are
stronger men than the Sheriff.

522
00:38:14,194 --> 00:38:14,940
Will!

523
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,240
- Will, come on!
- Robin, why did you have to do this?

524
00:38:18,911 --> 00:38:20,402
To prove my point.

525
00:38:21,594 --> 00:38:23,967
Will Scarlett still 
believes in the right thing.

525
00:38:24,087 --> 00:38:25,480
Will, please...

526
00:38:28,114 --> 00:38:30,131
Will, do this.

527
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,400
I'll take you to her.

528
00:38:33,727 --> 00:38:36,152
Go, go to the Sheriff's quarters, go.

529
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:38,615
I'll see you there.

530
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:57,920
Who's that? What are you doing? Come on!

531
00:39:06,823 --> 00:39:09,783
Nothing like the taste
of your own medicine, is there?

532
00:39:16,549 --> 00:39:17,700
And you...

533
00:39:18,184 --> 00:39:20,331
have an announcement to make.

534
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:29,200
People of Nottingham!

535
00:39:29,478 --> 00:39:32,535
There is no pestilence.

536
00:39:35,227 --> 00:39:36,955
This was poison.

537
00:39:37,354 --> 00:39:40,142
An experiment for which I'm...

538
00:39:40,931 --> 00:39:44,021
- truly, truly sorry.
- Shah Mat...

539
00:39:44,733 --> 00:39:45,727
I can't,

540
00:39:45,847 --> 00:39:47,240
I'm too weak.

541
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,160
- Robin!
- Djaq, the remedy. Quick.

542
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:53,580
Will, this is your call.

543
00:39:54,111 --> 00:39:57,273
Prove to me Will Scarlett
believes in doing the right thing.

544
00:39:58,252 --> 00:40:01,000
- You didn't drink the poison, did you?
- No.

545
00:40:01,621 --> 00:40:03,880
But I think my point still stands so...

546
00:40:06,027 --> 00:40:08,513
Yes, yes, it does.

547
00:40:13,037 --> 00:40:16,324
This is to the memory
of my good father, Dan Scarlett

548
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,587
and the people of Nottingham.

549
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,728
He can't be dead.

550
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,079
This is getting weird now.

551
00:40:33,241 --> 00:40:35,519
I want him to live
and I don't want him to live.

552
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,600
Come on!

553
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:38,353
Just joshing.

554
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,360
Finish the speech.

555
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,538
Oh, I don't think so.
I've had the remedy. Guards!

556
00:40:43,798 --> 00:40:47,160
Guards! Go, go! Robin Hood! Kill him!

557
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:52,919
Then he looked and saw
the angel of death

558
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:54,720
standing between heaven and earth.

559
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,200
Joseph, there's a cure.
I can give you the antidote.

560
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,774
I was going to be remembered
for a thousand years.

561
00:41:00,894 --> 00:41:03,000
The creator of the perfect poison.

562
00:41:03,451 --> 00:41:06,519
- There cannot be an antidote.
- There is an antidote.

563
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:08,719
- And any woodsman would know it.
- No...

564
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,593
Good.

565
00:41:24,871 --> 00:41:26,216
Give me your hand.

566
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,539
Get him!

567
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,960
Stop him!

568
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:25,088
- It's good to have you back, Lukey.
- Are you ready for this?

569
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:26,930
What's he doing up there?

570
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:30,764
I thought you said Will was gonna build
something to remind you of your father.

571
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:31,751
He is.

572
00:42:33,361 --> 00:42:35,434
- Wait for the light.
- The light?

573
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:37,640
It is light.

574
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,263
Any second...

575
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:48,022
Now.

576
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:02,594
Dan...

577
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,200
That is...

578
00:43:10,865 --> 00:43:11,983
Beautiful.

579
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:17,759
He was a good man.

580
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,231
Yep.

581
00:43:20,923 --> 00:43:21,737
He was.

582
00:43:25,899 --> 00:43:27,946
- He's been tipped off.
- By who?

583
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:31,040
- Henry of Lewes.
- Why did you let the messenger through?

584
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,587
- I think I have a spy in my gang.
- Bring her medicines.

585
00:43:33,721 --> 00:43:35,239
The Sheriff wants your services.

586
00:43:35,401 --> 00:43:37,240
If she lays one finger on my patient...

587
00:43:38,025 --> 00:43:39,960
I can't let him live
to speak his treason.

588
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,854
The Sheriff knows she helped.
They're having her ducked as a witch!

589
00:43:42,974 --> 00:43:45,440
- We need to know who the traitor is.
- Tell us, Robin!
