1
00:00:32,361 --> 00:00:34,486
Fire!

2
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:35,821
You!

3
00:00:37,194 --> 00:00:38,855
We told you to go!

4
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:41,256
Quickly! Help! Help!

5
00:00:42,526 --> 00:00:46,117
Heretic! Heretic!

6
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:07,414
Kill the heretic! Kill him!

7
00:01:09,456 --> 00:01:11,217
Put him in!

8
00:01:21,588 --> 00:01:23,281
- It's the devil!
- Stop!

9
00:01:23,354 --> 00:01:25,410
He's come to save his own!

10
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:27,316
The devil couldn't make it.

11
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:29,783
You'll have to deal with me instead!

12
00:01:29,853 --> 00:01:32,751
This is no business of yours, Robin.
The stranger' s been killing our livestock.

13
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,716
- Fouling our well!
- What kind of man burns churches?

14
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:38,546
I'll let you know...

15
00:01:38,618 --> 00:01:40,015
when I've asked him.

16
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:41,947
He fights like a Crusader.

17
00:01:42,017 --> 00:01:43,415
Soldier! Break!

18
00:01:43,484 --> 00:01:44,973
Battle!

19
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:46,448
Oh, no...

20
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,946
Bring him back! Heretic!

21
00:02:38,343 --> 00:02:42,933
So. Master, forgive me,
but you found him trying to burn a church

22
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:44,974
yet you saved him and not the church.

23
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:48,370
Because I could not fit the church on my horse!

24
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:51,696
What are they?

25
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,536
These look like Eastern symbols. Djaq?

26
00:02:57,906 --> 00:02:59,838
Do these mean anything to you?

27
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:05,962
Ah! I don't know.

28
00:03:07,672 --> 00:03:09,035
It could be some sort of code.

29
00:03:15,704 --> 00:03:17,260
It's strange.

30
00:03:17,337 --> 00:03:19,802
He fought like a Crusader back in Locksley.

31
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,960
Yeah, on the wrong side by the looks of him.

32
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:25,093
No. He definitely went out with King Richard.

33
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:30,191
He's beyond sides now.

34
00:03:31,668 --> 00:03:33,258
War has turned his mind.

35
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:35,026
Crusader' s sickness.

36
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,225
And there 'll be thousands more like him
while the war drags on. He needs care.

37
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,596
Much, you need to look after him.

38
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:46,189
Oh, no. Master.

39
00:03:47,265 --> 00:03:48,663
Master, please.

40
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:51,027
I mean, look at him. Surely...

41
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,825
Well, you looked after me all these years.

42
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:55,659
Yeah, but... he's a menace!

43
00:03:55,731 --> 00:04:01,458
Yes! You know, I think that's the first time
we've actually agreed on something.

44
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,689
He's been burning down churches
and fouling wells!

45
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,626
Fine.

46
00:04:22,694 --> 00:04:24,750
I'll look after him.

47
00:04:24,827 --> 00:04:27,349
Just answer me one question.

48
00:04:27,426 --> 00:04:30,880
How are you meant to look after
a deranged heretic?

49
00:04:43,224 --> 00:04:47,781
Meat. The secret
to controlling wild birds.

50
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,819
Not jealous of a horse, are we?

51
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:54,514
Marian and I have had
a disagreement, that is all.

52
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:57,714
- I had hoped...
- Hope. I would rather be dead

53
00:04:57,788 --> 00:05:00,811
than spend my life hoping.
"I hope for this. I hope for that."

54
00:05:00,888 --> 00:05:02,717
Buy her something.

55
00:05:02,788 --> 00:05:04,946
A trinket or two.

56
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:07,044
Marian is not the type to be bought.

57
00:05:07,154 --> 00:05:10,313
Nonsense. All women can be bought.
It's a nesting thing.

58
00:05:10,387 --> 00:05:12,648
They want to make sure their
offspring are provided for.

59
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:14,015
They're animals, really.

60
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:19,912
Sir, your Saracen guest has asked
if you're gonna be dining with him.

61
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:21,848
Already? What have you prepared for him?

62
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:22,885
Brain of goat.

63
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:26,077
Mm... Marvelous!

64
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:27,548
Here, give him this.

65
00:05:28,617 --> 00:05:31,082
I can't believe the Saracens
like that kind of filth.

66
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,082
No, I don't believe so either.

67
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,548
But I think our Saracen friend...
Well, he thinks we're being polite.

68
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:42,169
We've got to keep him happy, Gisborne,
if we're to get what we want.

69
00:05:42,248 --> 00:05:45,180
Amazing! You've got to see this wagon, boys,
it's completely unique!

70
00:05:45,248 --> 00:05:47,770
I've never seen a set of wheels like it!

71
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,814
Independent suspension,
reinforced chassis...

72
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,244
- It's a fine machine, Robin!
- What is it?

73
00:05:53,314 --> 00:05:56,245
- Rich owner, too.
- Cos this is not English wood.

74
00:05:56,313 --> 00:05:57,869
This is spectacular!

75
00:05:57,946 --> 00:06:01,242
Eastern cedar. My dad got a block of it once
to make dagger handles.

76
00:06:01,312 --> 00:06:04,642
- It's very easy to rout.
- Slides right down...

77
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:09,234
This must've got caught up in the storm two
weeks ago. This gully must have been a torrent.

78
00:06:09,311 --> 00:06:12,402
- Hey, it looks like some kind of list.
- Is that directions?

79
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:18,240
It's the castle, I think.

80
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,639
Looks like the Sheriff's got himself a rich visitor.

81
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:27,138
What's up, John?

82
00:06:27,242 --> 00:06:30,071
There! There!

83
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:32,800
Eh? Steady up, John...
What's got into you?

84
00:06:37,973 --> 00:06:39,371
It's no joke, Robin!

85
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,429
- It's witchcraft!
- Hardly!

86
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,762
It's a fine piece of work...

87
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,327
for a nasty mind. Robin.

88
00:06:50,405 --> 00:06:53,394
The Sheriff's certainly keeping
some strange company.

89
00:06:56,538 --> 00:06:58,265
Robin! Let it be!

90
00:06:58,337 --> 00:07:00,462
John, it's only a mask.

91
00:07:06,136 --> 00:07:08,465
Oh, come on!

92
00:07:12,002 --> 00:07:13,366
Get a grip!

93
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:20,659
Really. I do not like surprises.

94
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:24,562
Well, you'll like this one.

95
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:29,961
Oh, he's beautiful.

96
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:36,123
- But I cannot possibly accept him.
- Why not?

97
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,664
- The expense.
- What expense?

98
00:07:38,732 --> 00:07:42,129
- My fortune is secure, I can provide for you.
- Really?

99
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:44,356
That's what I've been trying to show you.

100
00:07:45,397 --> 00:07:47,522
Humor me.

101
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:49,585
Just put him through his paces.

102
00:07:50,363 --> 00:07:51,693
OK.

103
00:08:06,494 --> 00:08:08,550
Right! We're going to try some cooking!

104
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,292
Very calming. Understand?

105
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,390
I'll take that as a yes.

106
00:08:16,592 --> 00:08:21,751
Now, we have pork, carrots, onions, parsnips.

107
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:27,052
Now, most servants would tell you
that this is a stew. But...

108
00:08:27,124 --> 00:08:29,851
Well, this I call the Much Touch.

109
00:08:29,924 --> 00:08:31,583
Take the same ingredients,

110
00:08:31,657 --> 00:08:34,179
chop them up...

111
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:38,086
skewer them on a broken arrow...

112
00:08:38,156 --> 00:08:39,588
cook it over a fire...

113
00:08:39,656 --> 00:08:42,383
You're left with something far more...

114
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,512
interesting!

115
00:08:44,588 --> 00:08:46,985
Learnt that in Cyprus.

116
00:08:47,088 --> 00:08:49,747
- There, they call it...
- Sish kebabi.

117
00:08:52,587 --> 00:08:55,348
Then you'll know how delicious they are.

118
00:08:57,187 --> 00:09:00,152
Are you sure it's a good idea
to give him the knife?

119
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:07,108
He does have a name. He's called, er...

120
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:10,746
He's called Harold.

121
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,948
Maybe this is your true calling.
Your new life.

122
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:18,006
I've often thought a man could
make a good living doing this.

123
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:22,209
Get himself a cart and wheel it
up to the alehouse of an evening,

124
00:09:22,283 --> 00:09:27,010
set out his wares -
some of these, a bit of stew, meat pies...

125
00:09:27,082 --> 00:09:28,378
Make a killing!

126
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:30,074
- Rubbish! It is!
- And another thing...

127
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:33,273
...my cousin definitely saw a man
turn into a frog!

128
00:09:33,348 --> 00:09:36,973
- He did! Just outside Dorchester!
- You said he was always drunk.

129
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:39,013
Well, he is. But still...

130
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,706
Another mouth for dinner.

131
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,803
- Waaargh!
- Not you as well!?

132
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,005
- What is that?
- Put it this way.

133
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:48,840
I would not like to be on
the receiving end of this.

134
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:53,367
- Looks like it's for torture.
- Whatever it is, that is not Christian!

135
00:09:53,445 --> 00:09:57,843
Don't do that! You might cause plagues
of locusts. Rivers of blood!

136
00:09:57,911 --> 00:09:59,467
What?!

137
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:03,339
Our friends are convinced
a master of the dark arts is at the castle.

138
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:06,376
Someone from the east to scare us,
a bogeyman under the bed...

139
00:10:06,443 --> 00:10:08,136
Come on! Look!

140
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:10,198
It's working already.

141
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:14,897
Something this grotesque
cannot be for good.

142
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:20,402
- Saracen evil!
- Nothing to do with me!

143
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:22,235
- Harold!
- Torturer!

144
00:10:22,307 --> 00:10:26,295
Calm down. She's one of us.
Now, listen to me...

145
00:10:26,373 --> 00:10:28,498
Drop the knife.

146
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,767
- What did you do that for?
- To save Djaq!

147
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,998
He trusted me!
He was gonna drop the knife!

148
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:39,898
You see?

149
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,335
That's how it works. Fear.

150
00:10:58,338 --> 00:11:01,022
This all looks most... delicious.

151
00:11:01,872 --> 00:11:07,562
In truth, food this exotic in my country
is eaten...

152
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,073
- only occasionally.
- Really!

153
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:12,280
Well, it's no trouble.

154
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:15,398
Anything to make you feel more at home.

155
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,458
- Bismallah.
- Indeed.

156
00:11:18,232 --> 00:11:20,221
Bismallah.

157
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:30,945
- So, when do we start work?
- Oh, I share your impatience,

158
00:11:31,005 --> 00:11:32,437
but we can't start without Prince John.

159
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:34,481
But it has been two weeks already.

160
00:11:34,482 --> 00:11:38,373
We must act by the next full moon.
Otherwise there is no time.

161
00:11:38,374 --> 00:11:41,432
Please, just a little more patience.

162
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:45,718
I mean, if there is anything we can do
to make your stay more bearable...

163
00:11:45,795 --> 00:11:48,226
Maybe more eye of toad and so on?

164
00:11:49,095 --> 00:11:50,822
No.

165
00:11:50,895 --> 00:11:54,122
I would like to press on.

166
00:11:54,194 --> 00:11:57,665
Perhaps if Prince John cannot come here,

167
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:01,007
I could recover my wagon and go to London.

168
00:12:01,082 --> 00:12:02,875
That may be easier.

169
00:12:02,876 --> 00:12:06,352
You are confined for your own protection.

170
00:12:06,353 --> 00:12:09,242
You yourself urged the need for secrecy
in this business.

171
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:12,151
Then let us start this business.

172
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,045
Prince John or no Prince John.

173
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:17,286
We have a saying in this country -
all work and no play...

174
00:12:17,357 --> 00:12:18,983
that's what the poor do!

175
00:12:27,356 --> 00:12:30,449
Come on, John! We're off
to drag the wagon out of the mud.

176
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:32,082
No!

177
00:12:33,194 --> 00:12:36,125
We need something strong to keep Harold in
when he has his turns.

178
00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:39,139
- The wagon's perfect.
- I stay here.

179
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:41,802
Protected.

180
00:12:43,443 --> 00:12:44,964
You're not serious?

181
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:48,559
The biggest man in Sherwood,
jumping at shadows?

182
00:12:49,022 --> 00:12:50,374
Not shadows.

183
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:52,713
The devil!

184
00:13:03,456 --> 00:13:04,448
Will?

185
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:11,042
Go in to Nottingham,
find out who's really at the castle.

186
00:13:11,445 --> 00:13:13,474
We have got to help Little John.

187
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:22,804
Don't tell me the Nightwatchman
has been dipping into the profits!

188
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,675
Some men take pleasure
in giving women gifts.

189
00:13:25,747 --> 00:13:28,440
This is a lot of gift.

190
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:31,967
And tell me, was it a lot of pleasure?

191
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,880
And how are you thinking of reciprocating?

192
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,431
Maybe you'd find out if you gave me a gift.

193
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:41,818
As it is, you only come out of the woodwork
to ask me for favors. Like now.

194
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:43,340
So?

195
00:13:43,341 --> 00:13:48,437
Do we have an interesting guest at the castle?
The owner of this was on his way there.

196
00:13:48,438 --> 00:13:51,943
- We think he's from the East.
- You've been eating too many mushrooms.

197
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:54,240
My men think the Sheriff
has been using a sorcerer.

198
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:55,897
Well, they've been eating too many mushrooms.

199
00:13:55,898 --> 00:14:00,203
Agreed! But if you could tell us who it is,
I can reassure my men.

200
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:03,105
- John will not even leave the forest.
- Hmm...

201
00:14:03,106 --> 00:14:06,752
Another one who only comes out
of the woodwork when he has to.

202
00:14:09,007 --> 00:14:10,780
I'll see what I can do.

203
00:14:15,037 --> 00:14:15,753
Hey.

204
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,543
Don't worry, it's for your own protection.

205
00:14:20,303 --> 00:14:21,720
Well, ours really.

206
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:25,749
- What did I do this time?
- Well, let's just say you ruined the kebabs.

207
00:14:25,808 --> 00:14:27,164
You don't have to lie to me.

208
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:30,966
You tried to kill Djaq because she is a Saracen,

209
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,711
which, if I may say, is odd

210
00:14:33,712 --> 00:14:36,867
considering five minutes ago you were going
to burn down a Christian church.

211
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,978
I mean, come on, make your mind up.

212
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,723
The Saracen, beware the Saracen!

213
00:14:40,724 --> 00:14:41,621
Harold...

214
00:14:41,622 --> 00:14:44,290
The Saracen destroys everything in your mind.

215
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,326
Listen to me.

216
00:14:46,568 --> 00:14:50,228
Now, apart from being a girl,
Djaq is one of the lads.

217
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:52,705
All right?

218
00:14:57,567 --> 00:15:00,999
Do you know when it's going to happen?
These turns?

219
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:04,555
Anything can start it.

220
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,325
I'm watching a child fishing in a stream...

221
00:15:10,582 --> 00:15:13,163
and suddenly I'm looking in the water.

222
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,430
The water is full of bodies.

223
00:15:17,564 --> 00:15:20,100
Drowned, left to rot...

224
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,009
So you know.

225
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:24,513
Where were you?

226
00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:25,811
Nicea...

227
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:27,661
Tripoli...

228
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,858
Pelagonia...

229
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:33,911
We were at Acre.

230
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,295
You must get the dreams?

231
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:41,577
Of course.

232
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:44,367
It's our punishment.

233
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:52,857
All this fuss over a painted mask.

234
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,526
Come on, you're not an animal.

235
00:15:55,527 --> 00:15:58,451
No. It's better this way.

236
00:15:58,734 --> 00:15:59,583
Better for whom?

237
00:16:10,993 --> 00:16:12,288
NOTTINGHAM CASTLE

238
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:16,566
...one goes in, one goes out.
If anyone asks, I wanna know.

239
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,788
- Yes, sir.
- Ah, Marian.

240
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,280
How thoughtful.

241
00:16:21,369 --> 00:16:23,740
Actually, I heard there was a guest
staying in the castle.

242
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:26,175
I thought he might enjoy some local fruit.

243
00:16:26,411 --> 00:16:27,993
Oh, no.

244
00:16:28,097 --> 00:16:30,181
He doesn't like this kind of food.

245
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:33,650
- He sounds intriguing.
- I'm afraid you really can't be here, Marian.

246
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,291
Orders.

247
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:39,662
Orders, orders.
May I remind you, Guy, we are engaged.

248
00:16:39,663 --> 00:16:44,418
You subjecting me to orders, however
impressive your gifts, is rather inappropriate.

249
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,727
Listen to this!

250
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:22,948
He hasn't got a bad voice! I haven't heard
this sort of thing since that last battle...

251
00:17:23,068 --> 00:17:25,148
Didn't you inform our Saracen guest
that I was sleeping?

252
00:17:25,149 --> 00:17:29,490
- He wouldn't take no for an answer, sir.
- Please... let them come soon, please!

253
00:17:34,189 --> 00:17:38,227
- You're a morning person, I see!
- Sheriff, I've had an excellent idea.

254
00:17:38,228 --> 00:17:39,361
Really.

255
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:42,592
If you would lend me some soldiers,
I can go find my carriage.

256
00:17:42,697 --> 00:17:46,301
What, that old wreck? I already said.
I'll get you a new one.

257
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:50,021
Unless Prince John is arriving today, Sheriff,

258
00:17:50,185 --> 00:17:53,151
it would make me most happy
to find my carriage.

259
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:56,060
It was specially made for my father.

260
00:17:57,015 --> 00:18:01,251
Well, in that case, how could I refuse?

261
00:18:01,505 --> 00:18:03,667
You are a most gracious host.

262
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:05,194
Bismallah!

263
00:18:08,772 --> 00:18:10,893
- Wake Gisborne.
- At this hour, sir?

264
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:12,761
If I can't sleep, neither can he.

265
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,696
Tell him to keep the Saracen happy.

266
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:23,046
At least give him the illusion of freedom.

267
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:27,580
I hope you're not leading me
on a wild goose chase, Malik!

268
00:18:27,581 --> 00:18:29,892
I am sure it was around here.

269
00:18:29,893 --> 00:18:33,655
Though it all looks quite similar. Very green.

270
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:35,281
Stranger on the move!

271
00:18:35,356 --> 00:18:37,791
- Out of the castle!
- What kind of stranger?

272
00:18:39,772 --> 00:18:41,695
- Saracen.
- That's our friend!

273
00:18:41,696 --> 00:18:43,828
We could be attacked by spirits at any moment.

274
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:46,350
He rode out at dawn
with Gisborne and his troops.

275
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,279
- Which way was he heading?
- This way, into the forest.

276
00:18:50,383 --> 00:18:53,410
We've got to smash that thing up.
It could draw him towards us.

277
00:18:53,411 --> 00:18:56,305
Nothing is going to draw anybody anywhere!

278
00:18:56,306 --> 00:18:59,030
Now, let's go and see who he is, shall we?

279
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:02,063
Come on, John, come and face your fear.

280
00:19:04,246 --> 00:19:05,888
It's all right, John.

281
00:19:07,872 --> 00:19:11,138
We are taking on the Forces of Darkness
and we'll be all right?

282
00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:12,511
Yes!

283
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:14,757
It's a Saracen man!

284
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:18,158
Now, listen to me, this is what
we're going to do.

285
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:38,256
There she is!
Come, let us see how badly she is damaged.

286
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:41,115
That wagon's not going anywhere.

287
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:48,464
She's still in one piece.

288
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,716
That's good Saracen craftsmanship.

289
00:19:56,711 --> 00:20:00,124
Now. We can do this my way,
or you can turn me into a frog.

290
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:01,710
- What?!
- My way, then.

291
00:20:24,322 --> 00:20:27,041
No!

292
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:37,642
You're sure it won't cause him any pain?

293
00:20:37,717 --> 00:20:41,359
What choice do we have?
He's much too dangerous.

294
00:20:41,717 --> 00:20:43,985
We need to control him.

295
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:52,108
- There must be another way.
- Look, we tried your way, he nearly killed me.

296
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:04,993
She says it tastes of strawberries.

297
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:06,869
If you want to kill me, use a sword.

298
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:10,526
No, this is not a poison.
This is to help you sleep.

299
00:21:10,641 --> 00:21:14,841
- You trust her? Saracen?
- Yes.

300
00:21:15,822 --> 00:21:17,708
And you should trust me.

301
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:28,608
Mmm... It does taste of strawberries!

302
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,604
I like strawberries. They taste of home.

303
00:22:03,266 --> 00:22:05,163
So, tell me, John.

304
00:22:06,448 --> 00:22:09,159
What is so powerful about him?

305
00:22:16,428 --> 00:22:18,974
At least one of you knows how to show respect.

306
00:22:19,113 --> 00:22:21,885
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

307
00:22:21,886 --> 00:22:26,390
This man is Prince Malik al-Ayyubi-n-Shadi!

308
00:22:27,373 --> 00:22:29,665
Nephew of Saladin!

309
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,765
I served under him.

310
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:33,561
The Saladin?

311
00:22:34,244 --> 00:22:36,617
- Oops.
- He is royalty!

312
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:37,994
Bow down to him!

313
00:22:38,873 --> 00:22:41,395
Nobody bows down to anybody!

314
00:22:41,684 --> 00:22:44,033
Not in this forest. John?

315
00:22:44,785 --> 00:22:46,082
- Come and say hello to...
- No!

316
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,296
You, I do not like.

317
00:22:48,364 --> 00:22:51,093
My friends would like to know about this mask.

318
00:22:51,094 --> 00:22:52,891
What have you done to it?

319
00:22:53,003 --> 00:22:55,190
I cannot present it now!

320
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,678
- That's a gift?
- It was.

321
00:22:58,465 --> 00:23:00,953
- A peace offering.
- Peace?

322
00:23:01,092 --> 00:23:03,323
Let's stick needles in his head,
see how he likes it.

323
00:23:04,128 --> 00:23:06,753
And this is what happens when cousins marry.

324
00:23:07,328 --> 00:23:09,793
This is a model, for teaching.

325
00:23:09,861 --> 00:23:14,746
Needles placed correctly on parts of the body
can cure all sorts of ailments.

326
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:20,440
- Sounds like dodgy magic to me.
- This is science, not magic.

327
00:23:20,474 --> 00:23:23,128
What, so you're a physician then?

328
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:26,008
You see, John? A physician.

329
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:31,032
- That's all.
- I'm not a physician. I am an ambassador.

330
00:23:31,147 --> 00:23:35,012
This gift for Prince John
is a gift of healing,

331
00:23:35,463 --> 00:23:37,720
to celebrate our new peace treaty.

332
00:23:37,743 --> 00:23:41,689
- Prince John wants peace?
- I want peace.

333
00:23:41,816 --> 00:23:44,467
The Holy Lands are drenched in blood.

334
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:48,448
Thousands of men die on both sides.

335
00:23:48,575 --> 00:23:51,547
This is not the will of Allah.

336
00:23:51,882 --> 00:23:57,714
It is the duty of all good men
to put an end to this barbarity.

337
00:23:58,084 --> 00:24:02,385
So, I come to negotiate with Prince John
and the Sheriff.

338
00:24:02,453 --> 00:24:05,214
If you really want peace in the Holy Land,

339
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:09,183
Then Prince John and the Sheriff
are the last people you should be speaking to.

340
00:24:09,252 --> 00:24:11,699
Whatever they've told you is a lie.

341
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,662
And how can I believe what you say?

342
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:19,916
You and your band of
superstitious, ignorant outlaws.

343
00:24:19,939 --> 00:24:22,774
Now, I demand you let me go.

344
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:25,712
I'm not being funny, mate,
we've just caught you!

345
00:24:25,713 --> 00:24:27,381
Let me go.

346
00:24:27,623 --> 00:24:31,403
Or let the blood of thousands
be on your conscience.

347
00:24:34,248 --> 00:24:37,348
- You ordered me to take him into the forest!
- You were supposed to bring him back!

348
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:40,716
- All right, I will find him somehow.
- A ransom requires a hostage!

349
00:24:40,717 --> 00:24:43,027
What am I supposed to give them, you?

350
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:45,897
How much do I get for lovestruck
idiots these days?

351
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:48,582
Well, the Saracens don't seem to be hurrying
to rescue their prince, do they?

352
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:51,013
They will come!

353
00:24:51,082 --> 00:24:52,737
Open the door!

354
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:59,739
Well... and who was it who said the sun
only shines on the righteous?

355
00:24:59,808 --> 00:25:01,255
He has returned.

356
00:25:01,694 --> 00:25:04,256
The Saracens must really believe
we're going to speak peace.

357
00:25:04,475 --> 00:25:06,963
Oh, such a brave man.

358
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:10,816
And yet, such a stupid man.

359
00:25:12,227 --> 00:25:14,334
Stupid man.

360
00:25:20,077 --> 00:25:22,276
Oh, nice legs!

361
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:24,220
I meant the horse.

362
00:25:26,997 --> 00:25:29,030
There 's definitely something going on.

363
00:25:29,215 --> 00:25:31,910
Somebody is staying in the castle
but nobody is allowed near him.

364
00:25:31,911 --> 00:25:34,499
It's a good job Gisborne's got
the gifts covered, then.

365
00:25:34,573 --> 00:25:36,902
You don't deserve anything from me!

366
00:25:36,972 --> 00:25:39,434
Guy is being unusually extravagant.

367
00:25:39,457 --> 00:25:41,794
- It must be a business deal.
- It's not business deal.

368
00:25:41,795 --> 00:25:44,039
It's a Saracen Prince come to negotiate peace.

369
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,827
- With the Sheriff?
- And he's expecting Prince John.

370
00:25:46,828 --> 00:25:49,715
Well, no one's preparing for a summit.

371
00:25:50,074 --> 00:25:51,809
You do surprise me, Marian!

372
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:55,280
So, how is Gisborne making money
out of a Saracen ambassador?

373
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:58,209
- It doesn't make sense.
- Unless it's...

374
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:00,813
It's a ransom.

375
00:26:01,158 --> 00:26:02,268
What, he's being held hostage?

376
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,958
But he thinks he's a guest.

377
00:26:04,178 --> 00:26:05,833
More fool him.

378
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:09,760
I'll bet there 's a fat ransom on its way
even as we speak.

379
00:26:10,045 --> 00:26:14,489
Enjoy the horse while you can.
I've got a feeling it might be repossessed.

380
00:26:19,615 --> 00:26:21,222
There we go.

381
00:26:21,575 --> 00:26:23,697
Just pop your head on there.

382
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:34,742
Time for another dose.

383
00:26:38,225 --> 00:26:39,919
No more.

384
00:26:41,489 --> 00:26:47,387
Oh, surely you're feeling better. I mean,
that's the first time you've slept peacefully.

385
00:26:47,682 --> 00:26:49,826
It's not sleep.

386
00:26:50,506 --> 00:26:52,137
It's living death.

387
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,456
If I am to be destroyed...

388
00:26:57,145 --> 00:26:59,089
let it be a soldier' s death.

389
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:01,010
Not an invalid's.

390
00:27:09,023 --> 00:27:11,022
It doesn't have to be either.

391
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:18,134
Your mind, it can heal... in time.

392
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:19,961
I saw the horrors...

393
00:27:19,962 --> 00:27:23,272
and sometimes I wake up
in the middle of the night.

394
00:27:25,401 --> 00:27:27,726
- But I'm still...
- You just saw them...

395
00:27:29,832 --> 00:27:31,313
I did them.

396
00:27:32,922 --> 00:27:34,345
See these...

397
00:27:48,423 --> 00:27:50,144
They captured me,

398
00:27:50,726 --> 00:27:53,208
tormented me,

399
00:27:53,827 --> 00:27:56,175
tortured me, until I killed my own.

400
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,049
Killed innocents.

401
00:27:58,281 --> 00:28:00,941
Killing was the only thing that
would numb the pain.

402
00:28:01,752 --> 00:28:03,905
I'm a monster.

403
00:28:04,426 --> 00:28:05,872
I'm going to hell.

404
00:28:07,451 --> 00:28:08,880
Who is "they"?

405
00:28:11,917 --> 00:28:13,688
Who did this to you?

406
00:28:14,532 --> 00:28:17,316
Pray you'll never meet them.

407
00:28:35,477 --> 00:28:36,414
Allan.

408
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:40,522
That doesn't look like a ransom!

409
00:28:40,684 --> 00:28:43,248
- It is not a ransom.
- Course it's a ransom.

410
00:28:43,249 --> 00:28:46,234
Flags of safe passage,
women to show good faith...

411
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:56,470
Robin, this is not right.

412
00:28:56,505 --> 00:28:59,386
Muslims are forbidden to worship
human images.

413
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,887
I'm not surprised.

414
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:02,472
It's hardly a masterpiece, is it?

415
00:29:03,514 --> 00:29:06,002
I think it might be the Al-Shuj'aan.

416
00:29:06,372 --> 00:29:08,559
Saladin's assassination squad.

417
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:12,934
Only one of them is armed.

418
00:29:13,756 --> 00:29:16,776
And that chest of money
could feed a lot of mouths.

419
00:29:16,996 --> 00:29:18,650
- Let's take it.
- Robin, no!

420
00:29:29,254 --> 00:29:32,008
That's not worship. That's target practice.

421
00:29:33,192 --> 00:29:36,535
You are not listening
to me because I'm a woman.

422
00:29:37,126 --> 00:29:40,470
- Don't make the same mistake with them.
- I'm all ears.

423
00:29:40,586 --> 00:29:45,541
Enough excuses! We must start
the peace negotiations tonight.

424
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:49,232
Every day that passes
more innocent lives are lost.

425
00:29:49,233 --> 00:29:51,235
Ya-di-ya-di-ya.

426
00:29:51,304 --> 00:29:56,360
I warn you, Sheriff,
I have heard aspersions cast on your honesty.

427
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,768
Aspersions? Surely not.

428
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:01,301
Now, I insist.

429
00:30:01,302 --> 00:30:06,864
We start the talks today or I travel to London
and find Prince John myself!

430
00:30:08,044 --> 00:30:09,293
You see Gisborne,

431
00:30:09,294 --> 00:30:12,730
this is what you have to look
forward to, already.

432
00:30:12,858 --> 00:30:14,455
He's starting to sound like a wife.

433
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:17,423
How dare you insult me!

434
00:30:18,846 --> 00:30:19,945
Two words...

435
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,942
Peace? Off.
Throw him in the dungeon.

436
00:30:22,943 --> 00:30:23,914
Sheriff!

437
00:30:23,915 --> 00:30:27,480
Sheriff come back! Sheriff! Sheriff!

438
00:30:27,677 --> 00:30:30,385
The Prince thinks he's here to negotiate peace.

439
00:30:31,021 --> 00:30:32,941
And the Sheriff thinks a ransom is on its way.

440
00:30:32,942 --> 00:30:34,625
But neither of them know...

441
00:30:34,706 --> 00:30:37,986
that Saladin has sent 
assassins instead. So...

442
00:30:38,868 --> 00:30:40,927
So, we stay here and do nothing.

443
00:30:40,928 --> 00:30:44,388
Let those Al-Shuj'aanis kill the Sheriff
and rescue the Prince.

444
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:48,937
- Sounds good to me.
- No! The Al-Shuj'aan do not rescue.

445
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:51,876
They're killers. That's what they do.

446
00:30:52,246 --> 00:30:54,521
Kill, or die in the attempt.

447
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:57,066
If they're not going to rescue the Prince,
why are they here?

448
00:30:57,194 --> 00:30:59,103
They're here to kill the Prince.

449
00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:01,197
Why would Saladin want 
to kill his own nephew?

450
00:31:01,198 --> 00:31:04,579
A nephew that wants peace at any cost.
Saladin wants a fair deal.

451
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,442
So why send him 
here in the first place?

452
00:31:06,443 --> 00:31:08,989
But that's the thing. He didn't.

453
00:31:09,162 --> 00:31:10,875
He came on his own.

454
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:17,761
- We have to rescue the Prince.
- We tried that before. He doesn't want to know!

455
00:31:17,762 --> 00:31:20,932
War in the Holy Land is 2,000 miles away.
It's not our problem.

456
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:24,810
No, Allan, you're wrong!
War is here! It's right here in the forest.

457
00:31:26,229 --> 00:31:28,139
He was an ordinary Englishman.

458
00:31:28,312 --> 00:31:31,459
He tilled the fields, he loved his wife,
he cared for his children.

459
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,658
- He's not married!
- It's an example.

460
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,158
Then he was forced to go 
to the Holy Land to fight.

461
00:31:37,331 --> 00:31:38,442
Look at him!

462
00:31:39,183 --> 00:31:41,195
A pitiful shadow of a man.

463
00:31:41,196 --> 00:31:44,853
Every day good men like Harold
are destroyed out there!

464
00:31:45,223 --> 00:31:47,344
Only peace can put a stop to this.

465
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,618
Who are you calling pitiful?

466
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:53,569
You ran from women.

467
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,030
You know about them?

468
00:31:58,273 --> 00:32:02,010
I know which part of hell
the Al-Shuj'aan come from...

469
00:32:02,844 --> 00:32:03,966
in here.

470
00:32:04,498 --> 00:32:06,881
They're the ones who did this to you?

471
00:32:07,849 --> 00:32:10,879
Does anyone here know
what these two are talking about?

472
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:32,411
That's what we're talking about.

473
00:32:44,937 --> 00:32:47,737
War is so much more profitable than peace.

474
00:32:47,969 --> 00:32:49,508
Especially after today.

475
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,488
Be careful they don't cheat us.
You know what these Saracens are like.

476
00:32:52,651 --> 00:32:56,597
Well, if they do, we shall give back their Prince
on a pro rata basis.

477
00:32:57,036 --> 00:32:58,552
Chunk by chunk.

478
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:02,601
Salaam aleikum.

479
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:06,606
Yes, yes, yes. Salaam aleikum.

480
00:33:07,034 --> 00:33:10,286
My dear ransom.

481
00:33:11,663 --> 00:33:13,807
The, er, the key?

482
00:33:14,085 --> 00:33:16,422
A sample of the treasure.

483
00:33:20,025 --> 00:33:24,341
Oh, yes, it's very good,
but I'd rather have the key.

484
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:26,146
First we must see our Prince.

485
00:33:26,147 --> 00:33:29,074
Yes, of course.
Gisborne, take him to the dungeons.

486
00:33:35,676 --> 00:33:36,532
What now?

487
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:38,824
I cannot leave the women undefended.

488
00:33:41,401 --> 00:33:44,996
I was really rather hoping to do
without the hospitality.

489
00:33:46,164 --> 00:33:50,434
All right! Leave your weapons outside.

490
00:33:50,504 --> 00:33:53,079
Bring the Prince to my quarters.

491
00:33:56,215 --> 00:33:58,888
Ha! One prince.

492
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:07,277
- No!
- Take him to the Great Hall.

493
00:34:11,513 --> 00:34:13,387
But you have not given him to me.

494
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:15,563
You have not given me my money.

495
00:34:15,771 --> 00:34:17,622
Then you leave me no choice.

496
00:34:17,877 --> 00:34:20,104
Here is your key.

497
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,817
Gisborne, help me.

498
00:35:50,223 --> 00:35:51,566
Guards!

499
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:56,453
Wait! Please!

500
00:35:56,962 --> 00:35:58,269
Take him!

501
00:35:58,594 --> 00:35:59,994
Take the Prince!

502
00:36:02,697 --> 00:36:05,520
Forget about the ransom.
You can have him for free!

503
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:07,789
You misunderstand, my friend.

504
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:11,643
We are not here to rescue the Prince.
We come to bury him.

505
00:36:11,644 --> 00:36:14,479
Along with all talk of peace!

506
00:36:25,397 --> 00:36:27,664
- Where 's the Prince?
- Forget him!

507
00:36:27,665 --> 00:36:29,135
Stay here, protect me!

508
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:32,206
I'll give you your Prince...

509
00:36:32,576 --> 00:36:35,376
- Where?
- In the hall.

510
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:40,395
Will, get the horses to the east gate.

511
00:36:40,893 --> 00:36:42,501
We'll get Malik.

512
00:36:44,615 --> 00:36:46,582
Don't leave me!

513
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:50,605
Guards! Guards!

514
00:36:50,705 --> 00:36:52,152
This way!

515
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,347
Get them!

516
00:37:01,348 --> 00:37:04,054
- Stop them!
- Forget us!

517
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,761
- Watch the entrance!
- You heard him!

518
00:37:05,762 --> 00:37:08,791
- Guard the doors!
- The Sheriff's with us?

519
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,684
Did no one ever tell you that fools
do not deserve to be rescued?

520
00:37:12,685 --> 00:37:14,398
This is not a rescue yet, Malik.

521
00:37:14,409 --> 00:37:18,243
La-di-da-di-da!
Will you two just shut up?

522
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:33,359
Get behind me.

523
00:37:34,783 --> 00:37:36,160
D'you have any ideas?

524
00:37:36,183 --> 00:37:39,134
Much, Djaq, John, over there.

525
00:37:39,135 --> 00:37:41,598
Allan, Vaizey, with me.

526
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,099
- Me?
- Do it, or we die.

527
00:38:10,783 --> 00:38:11,836
Oi!

528
00:38:12,473 --> 00:38:13,790
Come on, then!

529
00:38:23,656 --> 00:38:25,553
Ready?

530
00:38:25,831 --> 00:38:27,266
Now!

531
00:39:01,499 --> 00:39:04,693
I hate this. This isn't much fun at all!

532
00:39:38,352 --> 00:39:40,353
Get Malik out, now!

533
00:39:53,802 --> 00:39:54,866
One.

534
00:39:54,867 --> 00:39:55,827
Two.

535
00:39:58,602 --> 00:40:00,349
Keep behind me, keep behind me.

536
00:40:05,665 --> 00:40:06,846
Three.

537
00:40:23,073 --> 00:40:25,815
Get him, Prince Bismallah...

538
00:40:25,816 --> 00:40:29,079
far away from here.

539
00:40:29,473 --> 00:40:31,560
The feeling is mutual.

540
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:35,934
And Locksley! Remember...

541
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:41,524
Business as usual tomorrow.

542
00:40:42,102 --> 00:40:43,549
I'll look forward to it.

543
00:40:56,979 --> 00:40:59,119
And you've never done this before?

544
00:40:59,143 --> 00:41:01,052
I've studied the theory.

545
00:41:01,434 --> 00:41:02,707
Will it work?

546
00:41:02,996 --> 00:41:04,824
Ask him yourself.

547
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,965
How do you feel?

548
00:41:07,229 --> 00:41:08,803
It doesn't feel bad.

549
00:41:09,012 --> 00:41:11,465
It's been a long time since I could say that.

550
00:41:12,182 --> 00:41:14,497
How long will the needles have to stay in?

551
00:41:14,578 --> 00:41:16,266
Of that I am not certain.

552
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:19,757
I will send more instruction
once I have reached Jerusalem.

553
00:41:20,093 --> 00:41:22,811
No need. I'll come with you.

554
00:41:22,812 --> 00:41:24,189
See you safe.

555
00:41:24,571 --> 00:41:26,363
You're going to go back there?

556
00:41:26,364 --> 00:41:29,255
There 'll be no true peace in here
until there 's peace out there.

557
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,869
I'm afraid your hopes for peace
may be in vain.

558
00:41:34,254 --> 00:41:35,576
Not so.

559
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,092
Think about it, my friend.

560
00:41:37,416 --> 00:41:41,423
Saladin sends his finest soldiers to kill me,
and yet I survive.

561
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:43,321
It is the will of Allah.

562
00:41:43,645 --> 00:41:45,578
Allah wills peace.

563
00:41:45,821 --> 00:41:49,179
Saladin may be ruthless
but he is also a good Muslim,

564
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,899
and even he must follow the will of Allah.

565
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,169
Good luck.

566
00:42:04,527 --> 00:42:08,970
It's amazing what a few
well-placed needles can do.

567
00:42:09,781 --> 00:42:12,488
I don't think it was
just the needles, Much.

568
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:15,057
You understood him.

569
00:42:15,497 --> 00:42:16,831
You gave him hope.

570
00:42:17,989 --> 00:42:19,470
I didn't do anything.

571
00:42:19,921 --> 00:42:21,310
I just listened to him.

572
00:42:22,351 --> 00:42:25,279
Well, maybe that's the real magic.

573
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:27,246
Listening.

574
00:42:32,975 --> 00:42:35,579
Why don't you listen
to me more, Master?

575
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,530
- Master!
- What?

576
00:42:39,074 --> 00:42:41,401
Sorry, did you say something?

577
00:42:41,402 --> 00:42:44,873
Unbelievable, you talk to me about listening
then you don't listen!

578
00:42:44,885 --> 00:42:45,883
Pardon?

579
00:42:46,218 --> 00:42:48,544
You talk to me about listening...

580
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:52,302
Very funny! Very funny!

581
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:56,584
- Seriously, you don't listen.
- I do listen to you!

582
00:42:56,797 --> 00:42:59,725
You don't listen to me ever.
