1
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:37,411
- What have you got for me?
- Nothing.

2
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:40,481
- You killed Roger of Stoke.
- Allan...

3
00:00:41,315 --> 00:00:44,540
You knew I'd kill him. You Just
didn't want to admit it to yourself.

4
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,519
- You're low.
- Yeah.

5
00:00:46,795 --> 00:00:50,561
And YOU are here for more money.
So what do you want to tell me?

6
00:00:50,914 --> 00:00:52,519
You've got a messenger.

7
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,878
Henry of Lewes,
arriving tomorrow, right?

8
00:00:57,389 --> 00:01:00,376
- How do you know that?
- He's coming to tell you where and when

9
00:01:00,496 --> 00:01:03,282
the King plans to land
when he returns to England.

10
00:01:03,587 --> 00:01:06,148
But there's going to be an ambush
tomorrow on the North Road.

11
00:01:06,268 --> 00:01:09,200
If you want Henry to make it to
Nottingham, you better change his route.

12
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:15,760
- Hey, hey, hey! What do you call this?
- Noon tomorrow.

13
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,440
Gold.

14
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:22,042
IF Henry arrives.

15
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,760
He's not coming.

16
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,600
- He's been tipped off.
- By who?

17
00:01:43,668 --> 00:01:45,835
Don't worry, he's probably just late.

18
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:48,615
Horse needs shoeing or he's
stopped for a kip or something.

19
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:52,000
He's here to betray the King!
He's hardly going to stop for a nap!

20
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:55,945
- Could Marian have got the time wrong?
- That's a good point actually.

21
00:01:56,065 --> 00:01:59,623
No, cos Marian's trying to listen
at keyholes and stuff, right?

22
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,662
She could be making
all kinds of mistakes.

23
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:08,197
She could be making a BIG mistake.

24
00:02:09,815 --> 00:02:12,325
Go back to the camp and stay there.

25
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:16,075
- Robin...
- What?

26
00:02:16,195 --> 00:02:17,593
That's an order.

27
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,680
Robin...

28
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,320
- My Lord.
- What do you think?

29
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:29,446
Hastings? Portsmouth?

30
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:32,858
Which south coast port

31
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:36,307
will King Richard make his final,
fateful landing at?

32
00:02:36,427 --> 00:02:39,480
We'll know soon enough.
Henry's here.

33
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:43,324
- As I promised.
- Well done, Gisborne. Well done.

34
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:47,521
Ah, Henry...

35
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:53,800
Henry of Lewes.

36
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,371
Welcome to my...

37
00:03:02,797 --> 00:03:04,611
Get me my physician!

38
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,361
Get the Sheriff's physician immediately.

39
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:12,881
- Why did you let the messenger through?
- Has he talked?

40
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:15,331
No, not yet. He was taken ill.

41
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:19,267
Robin, I took a risk to find out his
route and you still let him through?

42
00:03:19,387 --> 00:03:21,881
- You can't go back into the castle.
- What?

43
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:24,587
Go to the forest. Now.

44
00:03:24,953 --> 00:03:26,953
I'll Join you when I've silenced Henry.

45
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,593
The forest? Don't be ridiculous!

46
00:03:29,713 --> 00:03:32,121
You told me he'd travel
by the North Road.

47
00:03:32,241 --> 00:03:34,219
- Yes.
- And he didn't.

48
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:39,594
Marian, I think I have
a spy in my gang.

49
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,480
Sub Wood Team
Moochie & Kiry

50
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,422
What are you going to do?

51
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:32,760
I'll silence Henry.

52
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:38,704
And then I'll find the traitor
in my own camp and silence him.

53
00:04:39,174 --> 00:04:42,507
None of your men have been
in the castle. I would have seen them.

54
00:04:42,627 --> 00:04:44,760
Then somebody's going out to meet them.

55
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:48,078
- I'll keep watch.
- No, you'll keep out of it.

56
00:04:48,198 --> 00:04:50,449
- No!
- Marian, this is none of your business.

57
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:53,272
The King's being betrayed right now
because of your spy.

58
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:55,806
- It IS my business.
- But what if the spy has told them

59
00:04:55,926 --> 00:04:58,400
- about you and the night-watchman?
- Then I'm dead anyway.

60
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:11,637
What are you doing, Blight? He's worse.

61
00:05:11,757 --> 00:05:13,817
- He's calmer.
- Calmer?

62
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,428
- You're calming him to death.
- Medicine is a Journey, my lord.

63
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:20,040
Not a destination.

64
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:21,814
Treatments take as long as...

65
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:25,560
Do you seriously think I've got time
for your journey, Blight? A clue!

66
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,013
Gisborne.

67
00:05:28,482 --> 00:05:31,110
You find me a quack who knows
what he's doing.

68
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,788
A quack?

69
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:36,280
Sheriff, I am a man of learning.
I give you science...

70
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,600
Science? You have given me silence.

71
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,930
I want this man to talk.

72
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:58,266
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

73
00:05:59,953 --> 00:06:01,302
I know you're angry.

74
00:06:01,422 --> 00:06:04,680
You're angry because Henry of Lewes
got past us, but you can't Just run off.

75
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,160
Much, you disobeyed my instructions.
I said wait at the camp.

76
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,400
Gisborne has outwitted us. So what?

77
00:06:13,992 --> 00:06:15,760
His luck will run out. It has to.

78
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:20,264
Otherwise we'll be asking where
he's getting his information from.

79
00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:24,153
What?

80
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:30,584
You think he's getting information?

81
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:33,177
From one of us?

82
00:06:34,256 --> 00:06:34,996
No.

83
00:06:35,672 --> 00:06:39,316
Master, surely some mistake. A traitor?

84
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:42,781
Who?

85
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:46,495
That's why you've sent us back to camp.

86
00:06:46,787 --> 00:06:48,320
Because you suspect.

87
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:53,124
- You suspect me?
- Much, I have to suspect everyone.

88
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:56,199
- That's me. You suspect me.
- Much, go back to the camp!

89
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,920
What do I have to do to prove my
loyalty to you? What? Tell me. What?

90
00:07:01,113 --> 00:07:03,283
I'd chop off my own arms!

91
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:06,628
Well, one arm, because once
I've chopped that off

92
00:07:06,748 --> 00:07:09,229
I wouldn't be able
to chop off the other.

93
00:07:10,618 --> 00:07:13,600
If you're true to me,
I ask Just one thing.

94
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:16,080
- You name it.
- Go back to the camp.

95
00:07:27,182 --> 00:07:28,655
Come, come, come.

96
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:32,080
There you go.

97
00:07:35,763 --> 00:07:39,278
This baby's Just like his mother.
Doesn't know up from down.

98
00:07:39,398 --> 00:07:43,201
- Again? Oh, again.
- Don't you bother yourself.

99
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,680
- I'll turn him the right way up.
- How do you know it's a boy?

100
00:07:47,395 --> 00:07:48,946
Because I know.

101
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:54,479
- But it hurts.
- Hurts?

102
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,098
You don't know pain.

103
00:07:56,218 --> 00:07:59,756
Try giving birth to him feet-first.
Then you'll know what pain is.

104
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,319
Bring her medicines, everything.

105
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:06,640
- Sheriff wants your services.
- Get off me! My daughter!

106
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,480
Your daughter can wait.

107
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:10,196
Mother!

108
00:08:11,935 --> 00:08:14,919
- Mother!
- You hairy pig-witted fox turd!

109
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,559
I'll pluck your eyeballs

110
00:08:16,721 --> 00:08:19,520
from your bony skull
and squelch them into cess pits!

111
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:22,039
- Mother!
- Rosa!

112
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,469
Speak...

113
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,125
Speak, speak, speak.

114
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,920
- Get off me!
- Keep still, woman!

115
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:34,079
Oh, you slimy little snot-head!

116
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:36,199
Matilda...

117
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,183
Blight! Ha!
It's the gravedigger's best friend.

118
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:42,365
The maggot's mate!

119
00:08:42,485 --> 00:08:44,555
Couldn't you find
a civil-tongued wise woman?

120
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:47,656
Apparently she's the one
the civil-tongued wiser men go to.

121
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:49,320
Hello, baldy!

122
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:53,652
Do you know who I am?

123
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:55,534
I'm the Sheriff.

124
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,207
And I have a job for you.

125
00:08:58,327 --> 00:08:59,919
If you were on fire,

126
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,400
I would not damp you
with my wet underwrappings.

127
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:08,115
Cure this man or you die.

128
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:09,720
Anyone that you love

129
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,829
and even some that you have
a passing liking for.

130
00:09:13,342 --> 00:09:15,879
I can't stay here!
My daughter's expecting a baby.

131
00:09:16,553 --> 00:09:17,719
Your daughter

132
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:21,344
can expect a corpse for a mother
if you do not do as you are told!

133
00:09:21,464 --> 00:09:24,440
Well, I won't stay if she lays
one finger on my patient!

134
00:09:30,975 --> 00:09:33,273
If I treat him, can I go?

135
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:36,406
Do you think I want you
cluttering up my castle?

136
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,904
When he speaks, fetch me. Immediately.

137
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,850
We'll get rid of these things,
for starters.

138
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:02,200
<i>Sir, there's a sign at the Trip Inn.</i>

139
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,416
Marian.

140
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:08,876
Where's your guard?

141
00:10:08,996 --> 00:10:11,320
I don't know. I must have lost him.

142
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:15,560
- Watch Lady Marian.
- Is that really necessary?

143
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:20,741
I don't know. Is it?

144
00:10:21,295 --> 00:10:22,960
Do you think I'm a threat?

145
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,399
No.

146
00:10:25,935 --> 00:10:28,759
I was wondering if I could
have a day away

147
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:31,760
from the castle and the guards
and accompany you.

148
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:33,839
- I'm on business.
- Sounds interesting.

149
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,360
Marian, it's private.

150
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:37,639
- Sounds doubly interesting.
- Marian.

151
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,462
- No.
- Very well.

152
00:10:39,582 --> 00:10:42,000
But at least let me
have a day unchaperoned.

153
00:10:44,015 --> 00:10:46,415
- You're up to something?
- Yes!

154
00:10:46,535 --> 00:10:47,999
I'm charming you

155
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:49,880
so that I can have an hour or two

156
00:10:50,488 --> 00:10:52,200
without a goon on my back!

157
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,864
But you stay in the castle.

158
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:23,568
Did somebody order leeches?

159
00:11:23,688 --> 00:11:27,240
Haven't I seen enough bloodsuckers
for one day? Mostly in charge!

160
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:28,920
Lovely specimens.

161
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,328
Hungry.

162
00:11:35,735 --> 00:11:37,305
Let's take a look.

163
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:56,640
Robin of Locksley.
Mmm, what's that beard?

164
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:58,959
It's neither grown nor shaven.
Make up your mind.

165
00:11:59,121 --> 00:12:00,404
Hey, Matilda!

166
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,240
- Has this man talked?
- No.

167
00:12:03,914 --> 00:12:05,320
You can't treat him.

168
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,200
Good. Get me out of this dung heap.

169
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,680
My Rosa has a baby on the way.

170
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:13,240
A boy I'd wager,
by the trouble he's caused.

171
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,239
Twice turned himself upside down.

172
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:17,652
You were worse, I seem to remember.

173
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,120
This will relax her while I turn him.
Come on, let's go.

174
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:24,175
- I have business here first.
- She needs me now.

175
00:12:24,295 --> 00:12:27,960
- Do you know anything about this man?
- Yes, he was stung by a bee. Look.

176
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,559
What, this unwell? From a bee sting?

177
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,098
Well, it can happen.
It nearly killed him.

178
00:12:33,218 --> 00:12:34,855
That and the leeches.

179
00:12:34,975 --> 00:12:37,261
- But he's all right now.
- Wait!

180
00:12:38,935 --> 00:12:40,479
His name is Henry of Lewes.

181
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,680
Now he's come to tell the Sheriff
where the King

182
00:12:42,854 --> 00:12:45,919
plans to land when
he returns to England.

183
00:12:46,195 --> 00:12:48,765
- So you should turn away.
- Stop!

184
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:51,680
Has a dung beetle tunnelled
through your ear and eaten your soul?

185
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,839
I'll be quick.

186
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:55,235
A bee failed to kill him,
a quack failed to kill him,

187
00:12:55,355 --> 00:12:57,239
I'll be damned if a boy
I delivered sneaks in

188
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,919
- and finishes off one of my patients.
- Matilda!

189
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,038
I can't let him live
to speak his treason.

190
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:06,397
So it's not his life you're
afraid of then,

191
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:07,720
it's his tongue.

192
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:12,788
So? Shall we just
cut out his tongue then?

193
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:14,679
Oh, men!

194
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:17,240
Always think in a straight line.

195
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,798
- I've got a better idea.
- Can you silence him?

196
00:13:19,918 --> 00:13:23,207
Long enough for you to think of
something better than killing him, yes.

197
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,023
I can muddle his brain for a day or two.

198
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,760
Confuse and baffle him. Now...

199
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,592
Oh, sorry!

200
00:14:00,636 --> 00:14:02,729
- Well?
- Hasn't been in yet.

201
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:09,461
Must be held up.

202
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:11,920
When he finally arrives,

203
00:14:13,223 --> 00:14:16,153
give him this for delivering Henry.

204
00:14:16,408 --> 00:14:19,679
Tell him it's silver not gold,
because the goods were damaged.

205
00:14:24,402 --> 00:14:25,581
Thank you.

206
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,600
He's waking.

207
00:14:33,422 --> 00:14:36,120
- Matilda, quickly.
- Where am I?

208
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:41,000
- What is it?
- Here. It's mead.

209
00:14:45,795 --> 00:14:47,559
Right, Job done, let's go.

210
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,880
I have to know that it's worked.

211
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,467
Do you want the sun and the stars
as well? We've done what we can.

212
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:54,040
He mustn't talk!

213
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,960
If we spare his life
then we sacrifice the King's.

214
00:14:57,121 --> 00:14:59,118
<i>Look lively, you pair of oafs!</i>

215
00:15:04,058 --> 00:15:05,345
Is he awake?

216
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,914
Henry!

217
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:10,718
Mead! Horrible!

218
00:15:11,395 --> 00:15:13,716
Henry? My dear, Henry!

219
00:15:15,195 --> 00:15:16,356
Castle.

220
00:15:16,476 --> 00:15:19,312
Yes, yes, this is Nottingham Castle.

221
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:21,221
I've come from the Holy Land.

222
00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:23,999
- Yes.
- I'll speak only to the Sheriff.

223
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:27,840
Yes, yes. I am the Sheriff.
The Sheriff of Nottingham.

224
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:30,839
- The King...
- Yes, which port will he arrive at?

225
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:32,955
When the King returns
from the Holy Land...

226
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:35,123
Yes, yes, yes, where will he land?

227
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,400
- What's the King's plan?
- He will land...

228
00:15:39,927 --> 00:15:43,160
I feel strange. I feel...

229
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,767
Yes, never mind how you feel,

230
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:47,640
Henry. What's the King's plan?

231
00:15:48,598 --> 00:15:50,009
The plan King's.

232
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,697
Planking. Port.

233
00:15:52,938 --> 00:15:55,837
- Yes, yes, which port?
- Pork.

234
00:15:56,761 --> 00:15:58,920
I have come from the holy pork.

235
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,995
- Which port?
- Pork.

236
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,200
Holy pork.

237
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,539
- There's someone there!
- Guards!

238
00:16:24,455 --> 00:16:25,588
Get this to Rosa.

239
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,912
Get out of here,
you rancid-faced outlaw!

240
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:29,825
Don't stand on him, you idiots!

241
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:32,368
Get him up, get him on the bed!

242
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:34,430
Gently, gently, gently.

243
00:16:35,863 --> 00:16:38,545
Which port? Which port?

244
00:16:43,315 --> 00:16:44,468
Robin!

245
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:50,130
Henry?

246
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:53,219
He's silenced, but only temporarily.

247
00:16:53,532 --> 00:16:55,765
You're right, you have a spy.

248
00:16:56,169 --> 00:16:58,719
- How do you know?
- I followed Gisborne to the Trip Inn.

249
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:00,639
Whoever he was meeting didn't come.

250
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:03,159
A serving maid knew him
and he left money with her.

251
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,875
I heard them mention Henry
but I couldn't hear other names.

252
00:17:05,995 --> 00:17:08,160
That's payment for Henry's arrival.

253
00:17:08,456 --> 00:17:11,316
Who is it, Marian? Who would betray me?

254
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,747
There's Gisborne.

255
00:17:24,635 --> 00:17:25,800
Marian!

256
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:31,160
- Guy.
- You've been following me.

257
00:17:31,321 --> 00:17:33,193
- Me?
- Don't deny it.

258
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:36,351
- No, I...
- I saw you by the stall earlier.

259
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:38,256
Now here. Coincidence?

260
00:17:38,376 --> 00:17:40,079
- I was only...
- I don't think so.

261
00:17:40,245 --> 00:17:42,080
- You disobeyed me.
- Guy, please.

262
00:17:42,971 --> 00:17:44,163
Let me explain.

263
00:17:44,283 --> 00:17:47,259
You don't understand. Punish me
but do not punish my father.

264
00:17:47,379 --> 00:17:49,720
Punish you? Why would I punish you?

265
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:52,960
What have you been doing?

266
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,533
Forgive me, you're right.
I disobeyed you.

267
00:17:56,905 --> 00:17:59,215
I Just wanted to spend time with you.

268
00:18:00,134 --> 00:18:02,329
- Really?
- Yes.

269
00:18:04,974 --> 00:18:07,222
Well, I'm honoured, Marian,

270
00:18:07,722 --> 00:18:11,040
but I told you I was on business.

271
00:18:12,673 --> 00:18:15,240
Well, it won't happen again.

272
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:18,080
Shall we...?

273
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:38,161
What's your problem? Eh?

274
00:18:39,015 --> 00:18:42,439
- Did you speak to Robin then, or what?
- Why do you want to know?

275
00:18:42,695 --> 00:18:45,062
We want to know what's going on.
What's the plan?

276
00:18:45,182 --> 00:18:47,260
Did the messenger
get through to the castle?

277
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,775
- Is Robin going to kill him?
- Like to know his plans, do you?

278
00:18:51,074 --> 00:18:53,080
What's the Sheriff and Gisborne's plan?

279
00:18:53,402 --> 00:18:55,840
- What?
- I mean, is there even a Henry?

280
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,319
- Or is it a trap?
- What?

281
00:18:58,575 --> 00:19:00,958
- What's going on?
- How much do they pay you?

282
00:19:01,078 --> 00:19:02,320
Pay who?

283
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,426
There's a spy! In the camp.

284
00:19:07,961 --> 00:19:09,280
One of you is a spy

285
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:12,919
and Robin knows. So you're done for.

286
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:14,189
What?

287
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,479
- How does he know?
- It's obvious!

288
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:19,479
Gisborne's always five
or six steps ahead of us.

289
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,663
- Are you calling me a traitor?
- Well... Traitor?

290
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,880
- What you looking at me for?
- Well,

291
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,880
you're the one who tried
to persuade me to steal from Robin.

292
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,279
- We thought the King was coming...
- That's right!

293
00:19:33,441 --> 00:19:35,599
- We thought about it.
- We decided against it.

294
00:19:35,771 --> 00:19:38,353
- I said no!
- Allan. Stop it, now!

295
00:19:38,473 --> 00:19:40,799
Yes. If anyone's going
to kill the traitor,

296
00:19:40,961 --> 00:19:43,489
- it's going to be me.
- What makes you so high and mighty?

297
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:46,480
He doesn't trust you either.
Or why has he sent you back here?

298
00:19:46,864 --> 00:19:49,521
- Ah!
- Stop it the pair of you.

299
00:19:49,641 --> 00:19:51,501
Off him, stop it!

300
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,741
Robin.

301
00:19:56,801 --> 00:19:57,995
Master!

302
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:03,858
- What is going on?
- We're taking her to the camp.

303
00:20:03,978 --> 00:20:05,139
What, our camp?

304
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:08,397
- This is Rosa. Matilda's daughter.
- So much for it being a secret.

305
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:10,705
So much for a lot
of things being secret.

306
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:14,613
Djaq, the baby's the wrong way round.

307
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:16,721
Do you know how to turn it?

308
00:20:17,495 --> 00:20:21,040
- Let's get you to a bed, shall we?
- You don't, do you?

309
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,983
Get on with it!

310
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,080
Your majesty.

311
00:20:42,004 --> 00:20:43,601
He's not the King!

312
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:45,600
Mother!

313
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:47,597
His brain!

314
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,598
Bled to dried pig skin by his leeches.

315
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,920
She's poisoned him!

316
00:21:15,603 --> 00:21:18,200
Rubbish. I haven't given him anything.

317
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:20,411
I hate to tell tales,

318
00:21:20,824 --> 00:21:23,586
but I've asked around, and rumour has it

319
00:21:23,706 --> 00:21:27,493
that she delivered
the baby Robin into this world.

320
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,826
Pig. Canker.

321
00:21:34,355 --> 00:21:36,649
Blight by name, blight by nature.

322
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,959
Help, help!

323
00:21:40,235 --> 00:21:41,880
There's someone there.

324
00:21:43,715 --> 00:21:45,491
Oh, nice try.

325
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,696
- You poisoned him, didn't you?
- No.

326
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:54,852
I Just gave him
something to help him sleep.

327
00:21:54,972 --> 00:21:58,316
Well, you can give him something
to wake him up, can't you?

328
00:21:59,847 --> 00:22:00,550
No.

329
00:22:02,057 --> 00:22:05,344
There are wrong answers
and there are right answers.

330
00:22:06,328 --> 00:22:08,040
That was a wrong answer.

331
00:22:10,267 --> 00:22:12,400
We need to know who the traitor is.

332
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,640
I'm sorry. It's not the sort
of secret I can keep.

333
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,239
- Let's just deal with Rosa first.
- Tell us, Robin!

334
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,359
Robin, there'll be people like Rosa who
need our help, but if we're not a gang,

335
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:29,520
- if you suspect us...
- All right, it's true.

336
00:22:31,098 --> 00:22:32,840
One of you is betraying us.

337
00:22:33,537 --> 00:22:36,280
You're meeting Gisborne
and you're selling our secrets.

338
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,439
- Not me.
- It's not me either.

339
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,227
- It's not me. Not me. Not me.
- Stop this now.

340
00:22:45,095 --> 00:22:48,100
If the guilty man or woman
confesses, right here,

341
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,280
I'll listen.

342
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:53,440
Tell me what Gisborne said,

343
00:22:54,043 --> 00:22:55,560
what he offered.

344
00:22:55,854 --> 00:22:57,404
Step forward now.

345
00:22:58,031 --> 00:22:59,520
You have one chance.

346
00:23:01,003 --> 00:23:03,856
I will not be treated
with equal suspicion!

347
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,680
Well, whoever you are...

348
00:23:13,383 --> 00:23:15,200
you've made your choice.

349
00:23:16,373 --> 00:23:17,960
And I will find you out.

350
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:27,856
John...

351
00:23:30,366 --> 00:23:32,800
- Help me turn the baby.
- No.

352
00:23:34,408 --> 00:23:36,966
I have worked in the battlefield.
All men.

353
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:40,160
- I have never treated this before.
- Neither have I.

354
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:54,440
May I?

355
00:24:08,877 --> 00:24:10,519
- Oh!
- What?

356
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:12,510
It's the head!

357
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,119
Hello, little one.

358
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:18,359
Hello. The wrong way round.

359
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,692
You need to turn, baby.

360
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,760
- It moved.
- That's it! That's right!

361
00:24:37,695 --> 00:24:39,424
How did you do that?

362
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:42,320
Thank you.

363
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:44,891
Thank you.

364
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:54,658
My lords, Matilda here somehow managed

365
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:57,918
to bring a patient of hers
back from the dead.

366
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:01,578
Certified by my good self - dead.

367
00:25:02,392 --> 00:25:06,144
So, what do we have here?
Do we have a healer?

368
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:07,516
What's happening?

369
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:10,657
Or do we have something else?
A necromancer?

370
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:12,495
A devil worshipper?

371
00:25:13,501 --> 00:25:14,719
A witch?

372
00:25:14,955 --> 00:25:16,725
- She's not a witch!
- So,

373
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,200
perhaps a ducking

374
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,205
in Locksley Pond
would calm all our nerves.

375
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,000
Guy, you know she's not a witch!

376
00:25:25,595 --> 00:25:28,839
Marian, say nothing.
These allegations spread by association.

377
00:25:29,075 --> 00:25:31,399
The ducking stool's a death sentence.
You know that.

378
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,441
There's nothing you can do for her.

379
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,640
Did I leave you to die
when you were being drowned?

380
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:40,045
Guy. Guy!

381
00:25:43,795 --> 00:25:46,840
You could avoid this, Matilda.
Tell us the antidote.

382
00:26:03,913 --> 00:26:06,333
Boiled Sheriff's brains

383
00:26:06,994 --> 00:26:08,256
with parsley.

384
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,800
To Locksley!

385
00:26:28,348 --> 00:26:29,325
Djaq?

386
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:31,304
Later.

387
00:26:34,115 --> 00:26:35,401
Are you all right?

388
00:26:36,185 --> 00:26:38,291
There's a spy in the camp,

389
00:26:38,411 --> 00:26:40,079
how can anything be all right?

390
00:26:40,612 --> 00:26:43,079
Well, he probably knows
he's made a mistake now.

391
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:45,345
He had his chance to confess.

392
00:26:46,463 --> 00:26:49,560
Maybe he's stuck.
People get stuck, you know?

393
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:53,479
Your brother said he was stuck.

394
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,229
He refused to change
and he hanged for it.

395
00:26:56,754 --> 00:26:59,679
- He was an idiot.
- No.

396
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,370
He was a good man underneath it.
And you saw that.

397
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:08,719
And I believe Robin would see it too.

398
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,097
If the spy confessed...

399
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,576
and begged forgiveness

400
00:27:15,229 --> 00:27:17,074
and changed his ways...

401
00:27:20,146 --> 00:27:22,919
I believe you're a good man,
Allan A Dale.

402
00:27:29,236 --> 00:27:30,000
Robin!

403
00:27:32,592 --> 00:27:33,880
Robin!

404
00:27:41,272 --> 00:27:43,639
- Robin!
- Matilda!

405
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,760
The Sheriff knows she helped you.

406
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:48,879
She's refusing to tell them how to
wake Henry and they're ducking her.

407
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:51,200
- When?
- Now, at Locksley Pond.

408
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,560
Call your men,
I have to go before I'm missed.

409
00:27:53,721 --> 00:27:55,639
Robin! The baby's coming.

410
00:27:56,423 --> 00:27:58,721
- Baby?
- It's Matilda's grandchild.

411
00:27:58,841 --> 00:28:01,080
Robin. Hurry, hurry!

412
00:28:05,505 --> 00:28:06,883
Matilda needs us.

413
00:28:07,245 --> 00:28:09,560
Djaq, you stay with Rosa.

414
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,520
Everybody else with me. Now.

415
00:28:11,681 --> 00:28:13,911
- What's happened?
- The Sheriff's happened.

416
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,280
John, can you stay?

417
00:28:33,434 --> 00:28:35,837
Has he said anything sensible yet?

418
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:45,840
- Lords, ladies, peasants.
- Presents.

419
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:48,439
Pheasants?

420
00:28:48,715 --> 00:28:50,692
Have a look at this noble man.

421
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,080
He returned from the dead, possessed!

422
00:28:55,163 --> 00:28:57,200
The witch shall be ducked.

423
00:28:58,579 --> 00:28:59,920
If she dies,

424
00:29:01,557 --> 00:29:04,024
it proves the devil
has abandoned her, and she

425
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:06,215
shall be buried on consecrated ground.

426
00:29:06,335 --> 00:29:07,855
Constipated ground.

427
00:29:10,255 --> 00:29:13,514
If she lives, showing the devil
still to be in her...

428
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,879
she shall be burnt alive!

429
00:29:16,525 --> 00:29:18,560
Hard to know which one to hope for.

430
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:20,532
Rosa!

431
00:29:21,187 --> 00:29:22,560
My Rosa!

432
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:24,680
Down she goes.

433
00:29:26,604 --> 00:29:27,769
Deep breath.

434
00:29:41,175 --> 00:29:43,280
Oh, lovely grapes, Gisborne.

435
00:30:05,443 --> 00:30:07,892
You weasel-faced

436
00:30:08,191 --> 00:30:09,546
whore's son!

437
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,740
Who, Robin? No, Robin's not here!

438
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:17,984
And three, two, one!

439
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:22,741
Deep breath, deep breath.

440
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,880
There's something...

441
00:30:36,066 --> 00:30:38,513
- What's happening?
- It's fine.

442
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,280
Your husband, is he away?

443
00:30:42,455 --> 00:30:45,160
- The wars.
- He'd be so proud of you.

444
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,199
What's your wife's name?

445
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:50,218
Alice.

446
00:30:50,801 --> 00:30:54,566
So you've done this before, with Alice?

447
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,799
- No.
- Why is it so hard?

448
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,249
No, I was an outlaw in the forest.

449
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,360
Alice was alone.

450
00:31:07,014 --> 00:31:08,160
Push now.

451
00:31:15,715 --> 00:31:17,615
# Pom, pom, pom. #

452
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,559
I curse you!

453
00:32:02,074 --> 00:32:03,277
May snakes

454
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:06,290
crawl up your nose holes

455
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:10,239
and feed on your tiny brain!

456
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:12,437
Down, down!

457
00:32:32,881 --> 00:32:34,280
Breathe slowly.

458
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,520
It's going to be difficult
to take him. Henry.

459
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,195
Can't we just kill him?

460
00:32:46,315 --> 00:32:49,438
No, draw attention to Robin,
won't we? Put him in danger.

461
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:51,680
We bide our time, wait
until they're distracted.

462
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:55,470
Unless one of you two's
informed Gisborne.

463
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:58,624
- Keep your accusations to yourself!
- You keep pumping!

464
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,114
Let's lift up the carcass.

465
00:33:04,514 --> 00:33:06,407
Ten, nine,

466
00:33:07,022 --> 00:33:09,443
eight, seven,

467
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,432
six, five,

468
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,727
four, three,

469
00:33:15,943 --> 00:33:18,415
two... and a half,

470
00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:20,983
one... and a half,

471
00:33:21,465 --> 00:33:23,120
and bring up!

472
00:33:39,995 --> 00:33:42,265
What the devil is that, Blight?

473
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:46,480
I suspect they may be
her underwrappings, my Lord.

474
00:33:46,753 --> 00:33:49,360
Shut up! Shut up!

475
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:53,233
Arrest, arrest!

476
00:33:53,904 --> 00:33:57,189
Gisborne! Henry's gone,
Gisborne! Henry's gone.

477
00:33:57,309 --> 00:33:59,920
Guards, find him!

478
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:15,835
Rosa, where's my Rosa?

479
00:34:18,117 --> 00:34:19,182
Rosa?

480
00:34:21,284 --> 00:34:22,280
Mother?

481
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,537
Where's the little lad?

482
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:27,200
- Tell me the lad's all right.
- No lad.

483
00:34:27,843 --> 00:34:29,059
No lad?

484
00:34:33,524 --> 00:34:34,960
She's a girl !

485
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:39,272
Good lungs, she has.

486
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,799
Not a moment's peace!

487
00:34:42,075 --> 00:34:45,688
Well, let's see if her damp
grandmother can't set her off again.

488
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,791
Hey, my little...

489
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:53,000
What's her name?

490
00:34:53,614 --> 00:34:54,558
Alice.

491
00:34:54,835 --> 00:34:57,000
I'm going to call her Alice.

492
00:34:57,316 --> 00:34:58,376
Alice.

493
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,520
Still in the land of fairies.

494
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:14,241
What are you going to do with him?

495
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:16,919
- I'll banish him.
- We should kill him.

496
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,134
A traitor to the King
doesn't deserve to live.

497
00:35:25,595 --> 00:35:27,960
Oi, Much. Look!

498
00:35:28,742 --> 00:35:30,560
Much, meet Alice!

499
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:43,880
- Put him down, Henry!
- They say you don't kill any more.

500
00:35:44,456 --> 00:35:46,799
- For the King, I kill.
- The King's finished.

501
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,255
The Sheriff, Prince John and
the Black Knights, they'll win.

502
00:35:51,891 --> 00:35:52,831
Robin...

503
00:36:07,795 --> 00:36:09,480
Not today, they won't.

504
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,080
Can I trust you, Will?

505
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:22,360
Of course.

506
00:36:24,335 --> 00:36:26,967
- I need your help.
- Anything.

507
00:36:27,087 --> 00:36:30,344
Marian saw a serving maid
speaking to Gisborne. At the Trip.

508
00:36:30,464 --> 00:36:32,199
She'll know who our spy is.

509
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,880
I can go to the Trip,

510
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,640
find the maid and make her
tell me who the traitor is.

511
00:36:36,938 --> 00:36:39,720
- You go back to the camp at sundown.
- Where am I going?

512
00:36:41,435 --> 00:36:42,848
This is gonna hurt.

513
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:48,719
What's he doing?

514
00:36:50,395 --> 00:36:52,199
- Robin!
- Master!

515
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:54,520
Sundown, remember?

516
00:37:02,195 --> 00:37:03,519
I knew it was him.

517
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,992
I knew it was him.

518
00:37:05,112 --> 00:37:07,054
- Will?
- No!

519
00:37:07,494 --> 00:37:09,199
I knew it!

520
00:37:09,513 --> 00:37:11,679
Robin... Will's the spy.

521
00:37:12,603 --> 00:37:14,874
- This subject's closed.
- Will,

522
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:16,639
Robin, I do not believe!

523
00:37:17,165 --> 00:37:19,125
- I need to speak with you.
- Not now.

524
00:37:19,245 --> 00:37:21,440
- Believe me Robin, I need...
- No you don't, Djaq!

525
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:22,499
Trust me!

526
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,959
Will's gone. And that's the end of it.

527
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:29,579
I have to go to the castle.
I think he had a go-between.

528
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:31,479
- At the castle?
- Yes, at the Trip.

529
00:37:31,735 --> 00:37:34,919
Marian saw a serving girl
receiving money from Gisborne.

530
00:37:35,195 --> 00:37:37,974
I have to meet Marian to find out
exactly what Gisborne knows...

531
00:37:38,094 --> 00:37:39,440
- We'll come.
- No, no.

532
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,354
I'm safer on my own.

533
00:37:41,474 --> 00:37:43,199
Meanwhile, you lot have to scatter,

534
00:37:43,475 --> 00:37:45,839
until I find out whether Gisborne
knows about the camp.

535
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:48,276
I'll go to the Trip at sundown.

536
00:37:48,584 --> 00:37:50,415
Come back here after that.

537
00:37:50,747 --> 00:37:52,496
I'll tell you what I know.

538
00:37:55,695 --> 00:37:57,280
What are we going to do?

539
00:37:57,595 --> 00:37:59,819
You heard him. We scatter.

540
00:38:04,735 --> 00:38:05,987
You're late.

541
00:38:06,407 --> 00:38:08,562
I was going to keep your money back.

542
00:38:11,117 --> 00:38:12,046
Silver.

543
00:38:13,073 --> 00:38:14,104
Not gold.

544
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,079
You're going to tell Gisborne
to keep this money.

545
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:19,511
I'm not doing this any more, right?
I've changed.

546
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,639
It's a bit late for
a conscience, isn't it?

547
00:38:21,963 --> 00:38:23,520
Yeah. Very late.

548
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:29,880
Robin...

549
00:38:42,746 --> 00:38:43,951
You're early.

550
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,200
Leave us.

551
00:38:45,363 --> 00:38:46,880
- Stay there.
- Get out!

552
00:38:54,115 --> 00:38:55,465
I need to talk...

553
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:57,596
to my spy.

554
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,224
What was that with Will?

555
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:05,800
- You banished Will.
- It was an act!

556
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:08,833
Only she knew who was guilty.

557
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:13,488
And I knew the spy would want to come
here before me to cover his tracks.

558
00:39:13,608 --> 00:39:16,160
For all I knew, it could
have been Will standing there.

559
00:39:17,915 --> 00:39:19,043
But it's not,

560
00:39:19,578 --> 00:39:20,463
is it?

561
00:39:23,386 --> 00:39:24,400
It's you.

562
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:25,763
Robin,

563
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:28,533
it was over. You ask her.

564
00:39:28,812 --> 00:39:31,079
- I made a decision.
- Then what's this?

565
00:39:31,242 --> 00:39:32,680
I was giving it back!

566
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:36,519
So you betray me.

567
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:39,479
You betray yourself,
you betray your King.

568
00:39:39,948 --> 00:39:40,979
For what?

569
00:39:41,999 --> 00:39:43,875
For a few silver coins?

570
00:39:44,735 --> 00:39:46,800
What have you told Gisborne, Allan?

571
00:39:50,173 --> 00:39:51,644
Nothing really.

572
00:39:52,835 --> 00:39:55,242
- Does he know about the camp?
- No!

573
00:39:56,423 --> 00:39:58,159
Does he know about Marian?

574
00:39:58,683 --> 00:39:59,412
No!

575
00:40:02,081 --> 00:40:03,662
- More lies?
- No!

576
00:40:06,127 --> 00:40:08,159
This was the last time, I promise.

577
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,645
And I was wrong.

578
00:40:10,525 --> 00:40:13,279
But he captured me, Robin.
He tortured me, I had no choice.

579
00:40:13,441 --> 00:40:14,840
Everything is a choice!

580
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,719
Everything we do.

581
00:40:22,073 --> 00:40:24,200
That's easy for you
to say though, isn't it?

582
00:40:27,436 --> 00:40:28,965
You get the glory,

583
00:40:29,376 --> 00:40:31,774
you get the girl. Everyone loves you.

584
00:40:32,044 --> 00:40:34,999
Then when the King comes back,
you'll have land, property, a wife.

585
00:40:35,161 --> 00:40:37,734
Everything. What will I have?

586
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,556
You're always in the sun, Robin.

587
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,092
And I'm always in the shade.

588
00:40:46,436 --> 00:40:48,266
Is that meant to be an excuse?

589
00:40:50,598 --> 00:40:53,031
Give me another chance, please.

590
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:57,690
I wouldn't let Gisborne hurt any of us.
I've never told him anything like that.

591
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,990
Harmless lies? Innocent betrayals?

592
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,000
They don't exist, Allan.

593
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:04,720
Robin, I've changed.

594
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,194
How can I get you to believe that?

595
00:41:08,947 --> 00:41:09,920
You can't.

596
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:13,360
And the funny thing is...

597
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:17,145
- you might be telling the truth.
- I am!

598
00:41:17,836 --> 00:41:20,120
How am I supposed
to believe you any more?

599
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:24,240
Robin, I swear to you on my life!

600
00:41:29,395 --> 00:41:30,671
Don't kill me.

601
00:41:31,577 --> 00:41:32,515
Please.

602
00:41:41,547 --> 00:41:44,280
You're lucky I've left you
with a life to swear upon.

603
00:41:47,985 --> 00:41:51,263
Never, never let me
set eyes on you again.

604
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,007
Are we safe?

605
00:42:10,435 --> 00:42:11,176
Will!

606
00:42:13,533 --> 00:42:15,317
- Will?
- It's all right.

607
00:42:15,807 --> 00:42:17,988
It's all right. It wasn't him.

608
00:42:19,243 --> 00:42:20,010
What?

609
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:24,363
It was a trap.

610
00:42:25,188 --> 00:42:26,798
I lied to you, I'm sorry.

611
00:42:27,818 --> 00:42:29,532
I had to lure the spy.

612
00:42:33,464 --> 00:42:34,800
It was Allan.

613
00:42:35,423 --> 00:42:36,520
Is he alive?

614
00:42:38,129 --> 00:42:39,588
- Where?
- He's gone.

615
00:42:39,846 --> 00:42:41,908
Allan, why?

616
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:44,039
For money, John. Why else?

617
00:42:44,522 --> 00:42:46,526
I believe he could have changed.

618
00:42:47,421 --> 00:42:49,888
- You knew it was him?
- I didn't know. I guessed.

619
00:42:51,518 --> 00:42:52,846
I knew it was him.

620
00:42:53,128 --> 00:42:54,611
I knew it was Allan.

621
00:42:57,443 --> 00:42:58,902
Will, you forgive me?

622
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,000
- It worked.
- And the rest of you?

623
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:08,960
Travellers on the North Road.

624
00:43:10,705 --> 00:43:11,480
Right.

625
00:43:12,727 --> 00:43:14,080
Are you with me?

626
00:43:15,361 --> 00:43:17,840
Yeah? Well then, let's go.

627
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,342
- What are we celebrating?
- The signing of an important document.

628
00:43:27,462 --> 00:43:28,799
This is a Traitor's Charter.

629
00:43:28,961 --> 00:43:31,590
The Sheriff is making the Black
Knights sign their allegiance.

630
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,120
If you love peace, do not sign.

631
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:36,360
- It'll cost you Sussex.
- I have lost Sussex!

632
00:43:36,521 --> 00:43:37,640
I am Sir Guy's man.

633
00:43:39,361 --> 00:43:42,367
- Traitor!
- Marian? She's not here.

634
00:43:42,487 --> 00:43:45,600
- Winchester wants you.
- I need to give this note to Marian.
