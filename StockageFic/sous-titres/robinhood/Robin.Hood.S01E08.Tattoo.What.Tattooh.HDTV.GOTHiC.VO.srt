THE KING'S CAMP, ACRE
THE HOLY LAND, 1191

2
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,380
Much! Saracen raid!

3
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:25,800
The King's under attack.

4
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:26,480
Much!

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,200
Master...

6
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,000
Master!

7
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,400
You're wounded.

8
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:08,240
Get help.

9
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,200
The King's tent.

10
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,500
Now.

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,640
NOW!

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,520
Your Majesty!

13
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,040
Acre?

14
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:52,960
Yes.

15
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,320
It's his birthday today.

16
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,560
The King.

17
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,600
Gisborne is celebrating in Locksley.
Can you believe that?

18
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,600
The great and the good
raising their cups in your house,

19
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,600
to a man who wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,040
Without you there would be no
birthday to celebrate.

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,440
Can you imagine them,

22
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,500
the Sheriff and his cronies and their syco...

23
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,600
sycophantic...

24
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,720
It's galling...

25
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,800
In Locksley?

26
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,560
More than galling.

27
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,640
What?

28
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,920
Why don't we celebrate the King's birthday too?

29
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,840
What do you say?

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,840
There is something wrong with you.

31
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,640
I'm serious.

EPISODE 8
"TATTOO? WHAT TATTOO?"

33
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,840
LOCKSLEY MANOR

34
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,560
What is it?

35
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,760
What is it!? This is Robin's house.

36
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,400
Look at these people.

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,040
My lords, ladies and gentlemen.

38
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,520
Thank you for your attendance here today.

39
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,440
As you know, we are here
to celebrate the King's birthday.

40
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,880
We wish him success in the Holy Land...

41
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,640
and we pray for his speedy return

42
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,440
to these shores.

43
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,480
Please, raise your goblets in a toast.

44
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,440
To King Richard.

45
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,940
King Richard.

46
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,600
I myself have a particular reason to hope

47
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:27,080
for the King's early return to England.

48
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,040
For when that day comes,
this fair lady, Marian,

49
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,360
has consented to be my wife.

50
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Before I toast my future bride,

51
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,640
there is something I would like
to present to her.

52
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,280
May I?

53
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,160
You leave me little choice.

54
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,160
I thought you had already made your choice.

55
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,920
I have

56
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,360
This means so much to you, doesn't it?

57
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,480
This means everything to me.

58
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,120
Have I not expressed myself?

59
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,040
You mean everything to me.

60
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,400
My lords and ladies,

61
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,040
I give you the future Lady Gisborne.

62
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,960
Have we missed the speeches?

63
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,080
Hood! I don't remember inviting you.

64
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,320
Since when has a man needed
an invitation to his own house?

65
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,280
I don't know. Perhaps he lost all rights
to the house by becoming an outlaw?

66
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,840
I would have declined anyway.

67
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,640
My men and I are here on business.

68
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,440
Please,

69
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,040
everyone,

70
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,560
if you could assist us
by removing all your jewelry and valuables,

71
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,440
and handing them
to that man over there.

72
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,640
Much?

73
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,680
And then proceed to that room
where you'll all wait quietly until we've gone.

74
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,880
Do as he says.

75
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,280
Wise decision, Gisborne.

76
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,920
Well come on, move it!

77
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,440
Move it!

78
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,800
Get up there. This way please, my friends.

79
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,680
Thank you.

80
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,280
Look on the bright side.
Don't be shy.

81
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,120
You'll sleep well tonight,

82
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,200
knowing your donations will be
feeding the poor of Nottinghamshire

83
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,800
by this time tomorrow.

84
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,680
Signal.

85
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,280
Nearly done.

86
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,320
Master?

87
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,200
- So...
- Robin, this is ugly...

88
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,440
Yes, this is ugly.
This is my house.

89
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,800
So, Marian...

90
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,160
Back off, Locksley.
Marian does not carry money about her person.

91
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,440
- How do you know?
- He is right.

92
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,960
I do not carry money.

93
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,800
My compliments.

94
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,480
You're very wise to take precautions when there
are so many unsavory characters around.

95
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
But this ring?

96
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,080
Robin, signal.

97
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,240
You've taken everything else, leave that.

98
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,280
- Robin...
- What?

99
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,480
The signal!

100
00:07:35,104 --> 00:07:38,399
- Please...
- We should do this again. It was entertaining.

101
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,197
With any luck once will be enough.

102
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:08,564
- Surprise!
- It was you?

103
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:10,931
Do not pretend that you do not love war.

104
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:12,933
- I've seen you fight.
- When?

105
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,796
I do not recall.

106
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:26,363
Robin, what's the matter with you? Wake up!

107
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,724
Food poisoning?

108
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,526
Master!

109
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:48,996
Guy, leave him.

110
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:50,827
I don't think so.

111
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,131
What has he taken?

112
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:56,164
Trinkets, a few purses... nothing.

113
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:57,720
He has your ring.

114
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,593
Your parties are much more fun than mine.

115
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:46,722
Is this what you're after?

116
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:48,022
Take it.

117
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:59,421
- Who else, Gisborne?
- Who else what?

118
00:09:59,494 --> 00:10:04,654
You do not travel to the Holy Land
to try and kill the King of England on your own.

119
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:07,091
At least you don't.

120
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:08,592
You're not that clever.

121
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,990
Are you surprised the King has enemies?

122
00:10:12,727 --> 00:10:15,056
He has no idea.

123
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:18,058
He would make peace with the Turk.

124
00:10:18,126 --> 00:10:20,092
And there will never be peace with the Turk.

125
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,648
You made sure of that.

126
00:10:22,726 --> 00:10:25,521
Dressing as Saracens
and attacking your own King.

127
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:27,353
I did what was necessary.

128
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,392
For whom?

129
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,523
The Sheriff?

130
00:10:32,492 --> 00:10:33,980
Is he behind this?

131
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:37,087
Who else?!

132
00:10:39,225 --> 00:10:42,987
I will find out, and when I do,
I will see you all hang for treason.

133
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,183
Oh, and when will that be?

134
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:46,849
When the King returns.

135
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:50,823
I wouldn't hold your breath if I were you.

136
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:52,754
The King will return.

137
00:10:52,824 --> 00:10:55,654
If the King returns...

138
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:58,716
I still win.

139
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:01,646
I win Marian.

140
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,956
What are you gonna do now? Cut my other arm?

141
00:11:11,023 --> 00:11:13,352
No, I'm going to kill you.

142
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,855
No!

143
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:18,554
Killing we do not do.

144
00:11:18,623 --> 00:11:20,316
That's what you taught us.

145
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:23,980
We do not take part in bloodshed
unless absolutely necessary.

146
00:11:37,221 --> 00:11:38,777
That was necessary.

147
00:11:40,422 --> 00:11:42,251
Hang on. Where 's Djaq?

148
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:48,151
I think you should see this.

149
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,947
He's been acting like this since
you brought him in.

150
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,747
He's up to no good.

151
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,184
There.

152
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,449
What? He's not doing anything.

153
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,350
That's how I know. They never do nothing.

154
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,181
They always try something.

155
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:06,082
Something's wrong.

156
00:12:06,153 --> 00:12:10,347
With your permission, my lord, I'd like
to have him hanged sooner rather than later.

157
00:12:16,086 --> 00:12:18,415
What's that around his neck?

158
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:22,281
- What is it, pretty boy?
- Must be some sort of heathen magic.

159
00:12:22,352 --> 00:12:24,648
I don't like it. And I don't like him.

160
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:28,516
- I'm glad you got me here for this.
- Thank you, my lord.

161
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:31,107
A clue - no.

162
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:36,116
The next time you get me here for no reason,
I shall see you inside the cell, not outside it.

163
00:12:36,184 --> 00:12:38,173
Do you understand me?

164
00:12:38,284 --> 00:12:40,614
- Yes, my lord.
- I thought you would.

165
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:56,468
I knew it.

166
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:59,445
Heathen magic.

167
00:14:04,012 --> 00:14:05,568
Djaq is our priority. She's one of us.

168
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,406
How long before Gisborne's men
come looking for their master?

169
00:14:08,478 --> 00:14:10,444
I need to sort this and I need to sort this now.

170
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:14,342
This man is a traitor.
He tried to kill the King!

171
00:14:15,412 --> 00:14:17,809
Look, I'm not being funny, but...

172
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:19,776
- I didn't see it.
- Nor did I.

173
00:14:25,544 --> 00:14:27,510
You sent me for help, remember?

174
00:14:29,044 --> 00:14:32,908
You were about to kill him.
What happened to your famous justice?

175
00:14:32,977 --> 00:14:35,568
- Trials and evidence and...
- I'm telling you, it was him.

176
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:37,768
He's not even trying to deny it!

177
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,566
He tried to kill the King in Acre.

178
00:14:41,643 --> 00:14:45,575
He stabbed me and left me for dead
and then he went for the King.

179
00:14:45,642 --> 00:14:47,165
Then have him tried in public.

180
00:14:47,243 --> 00:14:50,402
Then he's seen to be a traitor.
You kill him here, he's a victim.

181
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:54,805
- I thought you said a Saracen stabbed you.
- That was before I realized it was Gisborne.

182
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:56,398
Well, get your story straight.

183
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:59,305
I've told you I fought him! I cut his arm!

184
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,466
- His tattoo! Look!
- You didn't mention tattoos.

185
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:04,905
I don't remember tattoos.

186
00:15:04,975 --> 00:15:07,702
Anyway, that's not the point. The point is...

187
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,764
They've got Djaq.

188
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:12,639
We can't leave her.

189
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:18,101
- We've got to get Djaq, Robin.
- They could be torturing her.

190
00:15:18,174 --> 00:15:20,503
Do any of you understand what treason is?

191
00:15:20,573 --> 00:15:21,937
I understand what torture is.

192
00:15:22,007 --> 00:15:25,404
Robin, we go to Nottingham. For Djaq.

193
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:29,469
This... is for England.

194
00:15:33,673 --> 00:15:35,037
And this is for England too.

195
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:38,563
Robin!

196
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:44,866
Sorry.

197
00:15:50,772 --> 00:15:52,863
Bottled hellfire, my lord.

198
00:15:53,772 --> 00:15:55,533
Melts solid iron?

199
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,663
It's the devil's work.

200
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:00,560
Did you make this yourself, my friend?

201
00:16:04,238 --> 00:16:06,499
Oh, come on, do tell.

202
00:16:08,804 --> 00:16:10,202
Solid iron...

203
00:16:16,537 --> 00:16:19,969
Ooh, ouch. Vicious stuff. Nasty.

204
00:16:20,037 --> 00:16:22,764
Very. Shall we have him killed now?

205
00:16:22,836 --> 00:16:25,234
Killed? Don't be so ridiculous.

206
00:16:25,303 --> 00:16:29,395
If he can make more of this,
I might even kiss him.

207
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,291
Sorry.

208
00:16:55,302 --> 00:16:57,597
- This is difficult.
- Untie me.

209
00:16:57,668 --> 00:17:00,225
That's... That's the difficult bit.

210
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:03,699
John said...

211
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,130
Little John said.

212
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,627
I think we should wait until they get back.

213
00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:12,591
- Do you want some water?
- Much.

214
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:14,565
Untie me. Now!

215
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,622
I knew this would happen.

216
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:19,589
That man betrayed England.

217
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:25,395
The slaughter in the Holy Land continues
because of him.

218
00:17:25,465 --> 00:17:28,920
- The others would not understand.
- Then you must make them understand.

219
00:17:28,999 --> 00:17:30,988
Exactly.

220
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:32,531
I need to talk to him.

221
00:17:34,432 --> 00:17:37,592
And I cannot do that tied to a tree.

222
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:39,824
- Just untie me.
- You promise me?

223
00:17:41,831 --> 00:17:43,956
Because earlier...

224
00:17:44,032 --> 00:17:45,793
earlier you were not yourself.

225
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,626
You were...

226
00:17:49,398 --> 00:17:51,330
I'm doing it.

227
00:17:53,797 --> 00:17:56,025
Now, you've had an upset.

228
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,990
You need to just sit down, have a nice, hot...

229
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,589
Robin!

230
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,493
Who else was in the plot to kill the King?

231
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:06,358
What are you going to do if I don't talk?

232
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,952
I will kill you.

233
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,962
I will kill you whether you talk or not.

234
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,326
No.

235
00:18:11,397 --> 00:18:13,158
You've changed, Locksley.

236
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,093
You told me so yourself.

237
00:18:15,163 --> 00:18:17,924
"Show me an argument ever
settled with bloodshed," was it?

238
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:22,428
You've become a peace-lover, warm and woolly,
taking trinkets for the poor.

239
00:18:22,496 --> 00:18:26,087
What are you doing?! You promised me!
You said you would explain things!

240
00:18:26,162 --> 00:18:28,719
- How is this explaining things?
- They are simple men.

241
00:18:28,795 --> 00:18:32,352
They've spent years hiding in the forest.
They cannot understand politics.

242
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:34,519
What has happened to you?

243
00:18:34,595 --> 00:18:38,118
I have not hidden in the forest,
and I cannot understand this.

244
00:18:38,194 --> 00:18:41,956
That, Much, is because you are also simple.

245
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:51,191
I did not mean that.

246
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,453
I have never seen you like this.

247
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,853
And may I say I am glad?

248
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,300
NOTTINGHAM TOWN

249
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:27,248
- Delivery for the castle.
- Toll charge, ha'penny.

250
00:19:33,124 --> 00:19:34,817
Daylight robbery.

251
00:19:37,024 --> 00:19:40,888
- Here! I know you fellas, don't I?
- Go on!

252
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:54,216
See? Who needs Robin?
As easy as shelling peas.

253
00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:04,716
Alchemy!

254
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:07,312
Marvelous idea.

255
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:08,854
Frustrating results.

256
00:20:08,922 --> 00:20:10,286
But...

257
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:13,253
Especially if you're my alchemist.

258
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:14,685
This...

259
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:18,778
is my last one.

260
00:20:20,788 --> 00:20:23,583
Inkwell. Poor fellow.

261
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:25,517
Good boy.

262
00:20:25,587 --> 00:20:27,019
Handsome.

263
00:20:27,088 --> 00:20:29,054
A bit like you.

264
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:33,118
Soft hands.

265
00:20:34,521 --> 00:20:37,453
But his alchemy, well,
it was wretched, depressing.

266
00:20:37,521 --> 00:20:40,680
Listen, I have to say, I was very depressed.

267
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:47,345
But then you came along
with your wonderful Saracen.

268
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,818
What is it?

269
00:20:48,886 --> 00:20:51,114
Zayt al-Zaj.

270
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,443
Well, whatever. Hm?

271
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:58,883
A liquid that can burn through solid metal.

272
00:21:00,285 --> 00:21:02,843
Well, who'd have thought? So...

273
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:04,941
I want you to make me up a batch.

274
00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:07,280
I do not know how.

275
00:21:13,484 --> 00:21:15,245
I need particular ingredients.

276
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:18,909
- I do not see them here.
- We have guards over there on the door.

277
00:21:18,984 --> 00:21:21,280
They'll get you whatever it is that you need.

278
00:21:21,351 --> 00:21:23,340
You have, shall we say... two days?

279
00:21:23,451 --> 00:21:25,076
Joke.

280
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:26,480
Two hours.

281
00:21:44,616 --> 00:21:45,946
This is wrong.

282
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:51,705
Master... This is wrong.

283
00:21:51,783 --> 00:21:53,975
I'm not going to kill him.

284
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,281
Just make him talk.

285
00:22:08,481 --> 00:22:10,242
The plot against the King.

286
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:14,846
I want names.

287
00:22:14,914 --> 00:22:19,278
What kind of King deserts his people to 
fight someone else's war in a foreign land?

288
00:22:19,347 --> 00:22:22,438
If you are his people,
then he was right to desert them.

289
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,878
No! Stop!

290
00:22:28,946 --> 00:22:30,343
I will not take part in this.

291
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:33,937
You will regret this.
You will see sense and you will regret it.

292
00:22:34,013 --> 00:22:35,569
This does not concern you, Much.

293
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:38,635
You are my master. Everything concerns me.

294
00:22:39,646 --> 00:22:44,340
I have followed you into battle.
I have followed you into the forest.

295
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:47,276
But I will not follow you into torture.

296
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:49,641
Then leave me.

297
00:22:49,712 --> 00:22:52,200
- If I thought you meant that...
- Go!

298
00:23:03,611 --> 00:23:05,304
Oh...

299
00:23:05,377 --> 00:23:08,571
You seem to be short of friends, Locksley.

300
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,642
And what about all those peasants
you've championed?

301
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:15,608
They'll be so disappointed when they realize
that under your fine words,

302
00:23:15,676 --> 00:23:19,006
you're just as violent as the next man.

303
00:23:19,077 --> 00:23:21,235
And not just the peasants either.

304
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:23,639
Some of the nobles you've championed.

305
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,937
Swayed by your charitable acts.

306
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:29,100
Edward...

307
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:31,639
Marian...

308
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:46,341
Make no mistake.

309
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:49,397
This ends here, traitor!

310
00:24:44,204 --> 00:24:47,432
Don't suppose anyone's given any thought
as to how we get back out again?

311
00:24:47,505 --> 00:24:49,970
Later! We came for Djaq.

312
00:25:13,569 --> 00:25:15,535
Face it, you're loyal to a weak King.

313
00:25:15,603 --> 00:25:18,398
- A King with principles.
- He's a pawn and you know it.

314
00:25:18,469 --> 00:25:22,026
- It's not England's war, it's Rome's.
- Then why have you made it worse?

315
00:25:22,102 --> 00:25:25,261
Your attack broke the ceasefire.
There could have been peace.

316
00:25:25,335 --> 00:25:30,961
There will always be war. So let's have a King
who will fight for our gain, not the Pope's.

317
00:25:31,034 --> 00:25:32,829
Do you know why I went to war?

318
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:35,129
To recover Jerusalem.

319
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,133
To recover our Holy Land.

320
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:38,826
- How noble.
- No.

321
00:25:39,634 --> 00:25:42,657
When I got there,
I met the Muslims and the Jews.

322
00:25:42,734 --> 00:25:44,563
And I saw it was their Holy Land, too.

323
00:25:44,634 --> 00:25:46,566
What are you, Locksley, Lord of the Dance?

324
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:57,399
And you were right,
there will always be war,

325
00:25:57,466 --> 00:26:00,954
as long as people like you revel
in their own ignorant bigotry.

326
00:26:12,565 --> 00:26:15,190
- I have finished.
- So quickly?

327
00:26:15,265 --> 00:26:16,788
We can test it on your outlaw friends.

328
00:26:16,865 --> 00:26:22,127
According to my kitchen master,
they've arrived already. They're so predictable.

329
00:26:22,198 --> 00:26:25,062
Oh... Were you expecting to be rescued? Hm?

330
00:26:25,965 --> 00:26:29,158
They won't think of looking for you in here.

331
00:26:34,697 --> 00:26:36,629
What are you doing?

332
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,121
What are you doing?!

333
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,195
Guards!

334
00:26:51,196 --> 00:26:52,718
Get on your knees!

335
00:26:52,796 --> 00:26:54,421
Guards!

336
00:26:54,496 --> 00:26:56,122
Stop the fire!

337
00:26:56,196 --> 00:26:57,593
Sound the alarm!

338
00:27:02,928 --> 00:27:04,258
Guards!

339
00:27:10,728 --> 00:27:13,489
- There 's no one here.
- That can't be right.

340
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:15,527
No prisoners. Not even a jailer.

341
00:27:16,961 --> 00:27:19,553
I'm not being funny,
you don't think this could be a...

342
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:26,390
Trap.

343
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,849
Listen, gents, why don't we just
talk about this, eh?

344
00:27:55,426 --> 00:27:57,584
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

345
00:27:57,658 --> 00:28:00,056
- I thought we came to save you.
- Now I'm saving you.

346
00:28:00,126 --> 00:28:03,455
- You're a woman, we're men.
- Irritating, isn't it?

347
00:28:10,657 --> 00:28:13,885
Where now? Do you actually have a plan?

348
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,947
I've never been in this part of the castle.

349
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,546
Have you?

350
00:28:18,624 --> 00:28:21,351
Robin! Where is he?

351
00:28:22,391 --> 00:28:26,448
Well, he is basically...
That's difficult to explain.

352
00:28:26,523 --> 00:28:28,955
- Robin did not come?
- He was, um...

353
00:28:29,023 --> 00:28:32,420
he was... distracted.

354
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:33,854
Because I am a girl?

355
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,579
Here... Go!

356
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:44,379
Seen this?

357
00:28:44,455 --> 00:28:45,819
Indoor privy.

358
00:28:47,422 --> 00:28:48,786
So?

359
00:28:48,856 --> 00:28:50,822
So, it leads outdoors.

360
00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:54,619
- Well? Have you got any better ideas?
- Must be another way.

361
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:56,710
We go. Go! Go! Go!

362
00:29:02,554 --> 00:29:04,543
Catch me at the bottom?

363
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,877
If you were that desperate to go,
all you had to do was ask!

364
00:29:19,787 --> 00:29:21,150
Take him to the dungeon.

365
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,550
If he doesn't want to play nice,
we will play nasty.

366
00:29:36,853 --> 00:29:38,875
We need Robin.

367
00:30:01,317 --> 00:30:04,477
You thought you'd come back from
the Holy Land, covered in glory, didn't you?

368
00:30:04,551 --> 00:30:07,778
Well, guess what. No one here cares...

369
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,607
They couldn't even point
at the Holy Land on a map.

370
00:30:12,683 --> 00:30:14,205
So what was it all for, eh?

371
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,210
Robin of Locksley,

372
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:21,613
Earl of Huntingdon, hero of Acre.

373
00:30:22,682 --> 00:30:24,978
And look at you now.
You're just a common outlaw.

374
00:30:27,282 --> 00:30:29,271
House and lands lost.

375
00:30:31,649 --> 00:30:35,706
Do you think I don't laugh
every time I go to sleep in your bed?

376
00:30:37,781 --> 00:30:40,713
And Marian, the woman you gave up.

377
00:30:40,781 --> 00:30:42,713
Lost. To me.

378
00:30:42,781 --> 00:30:45,077
You think I won't laugh every time...

379
00:30:51,448 --> 00:30:54,346
To be honest, I was surprised
you decided to stay in Nottingham.

380
00:30:54,414 --> 00:30:57,777
I mean, surely you would have friends elsewhere
that would take you in.

381
00:30:57,847 --> 00:30:59,745
I should have realized.

382
00:31:00,647 --> 00:31:02,636
Marian.

383
00:31:03,647 --> 00:31:05,942
I thought you'd given up long ago.

384
00:31:06,013 --> 00:31:09,446
But you still carry a torch for her, don't you?

385
00:31:09,513 --> 00:31:12,240
And now she is to be mine.

386
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:15,602
I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.

387
00:31:16,379 --> 00:31:19,038
She has accepted me.

388
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,673
When the King returns.

389
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:25,567
A detail.

390
00:31:26,712 --> 00:31:30,439
She will know you are a traitor. I will tell her.

391
00:31:30,511 --> 00:31:33,306
- I'll deny it.
- She is astute.

392
00:31:33,378 --> 00:31:35,105
True.

393
00:31:35,178 --> 00:31:37,110
And she has her doubts about me.

394
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:38,973
But she is also stirred by me.

395
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:42,107
She will believe my denial.

396
00:32:03,743 --> 00:32:07,698
- What are you doing? You're a killer now?
- When I have to be.

397
00:32:07,776 --> 00:32:08,866
Grow up.

398
00:32:10,176 --> 00:32:12,607
Gisborne made his choice.

399
00:32:12,675 --> 00:32:16,233
Everything is a choice. Everything we do.

400
00:32:16,308 --> 00:32:18,240
- You told me that.
- What choice?

401
00:32:21,308 --> 00:32:24,468
In the Holy Land,
Saracens came to kill the King.

402
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:28,072
But it wasn't Saracens.

403
00:32:29,507 --> 00:32:32,201
- It was him.
- Rubbish.

404
00:32:33,141 --> 00:32:37,970
He stabbed me and left me for dead.
And then he went to kill the King in his bed.

405
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,006
- I don't believe you. This is about...
- What?

406
00:32:41,074 --> 00:32:43,801
You and me.

407
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:47,704
I want you to know, I didn't realize
he was going to announce the marriage.

408
00:32:47,773 --> 00:32:49,796
Well, you didn't seem uncomfortable.

409
00:32:51,607 --> 00:32:54,004
I have proof.

410
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:56,403
His arm. I wounded him. His tattoo.

411
00:32:56,473 --> 00:32:58,200
What tattoo?

412
00:32:58,273 --> 00:33:02,398
- And I was uncomfortable.
- He has a tattoo on his arm.

413
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,568
- You took his ring.
- You took his ring.

414
00:33:06,372 --> 00:33:10,236
How could he have been in the Holy Land?
He was here in your house.

415
00:33:17,638 --> 00:33:19,433
What?

416
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:25,163
He was unwell for many weeks.
No one was allowed to see him.

417
00:33:25,238 --> 00:33:28,170
- That is why I have to kill him.
- No. Even if you are right...

418
00:33:28,238 --> 00:33:31,635
- I am right.
- A trial. The process of law.

419
00:33:31,704 --> 00:33:33,533
There is no law.

420
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:38,830
Until Richard returns,
the Sheriff is the law. Gisborne is the law.

421
00:33:38,904 --> 00:33:41,335
And that is why I have to kill him.

422
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:43,301
No. I forbid you.

423
00:33:47,036 --> 00:33:50,559
- You don't believe me?
- I don't know what to believe.

424
00:33:50,636 --> 00:33:53,796
Guy is not a man who would...

425
00:33:54,903 --> 00:33:56,266
Surely...

426
00:33:56,336 --> 00:33:58,529
Of course.

427
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,193
He is to be your husband.

428
00:34:00,269 --> 00:34:02,928
You know full well I agreed to that
under duress.

429
00:34:03,002 --> 00:34:06,263
You know I have to play things
this way from the inside.

430
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,324
For my father if for nothing else.

431
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:10,958
I do not have the option
to just run off into the forest.

432
00:34:14,602 --> 00:34:17,897
- What?
- Everything...

433
00:34:17,968 --> 00:34:19,332
is a choice.

434
00:34:36,766 --> 00:34:41,130
Now, look. He's been my master for ten years.
What do you expect me to do?

435
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,597
What happened?

436
00:34:49,366 --> 00:34:51,354
You stink!

437
00:34:53,498 --> 00:34:54,862
Where 's Djaq?

438
00:34:56,165 --> 00:34:57,859
It was a trap!

439
00:34:57,931 --> 00:35:00,193
- We came out through the privy.
- She was right behind us.

440
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,026
They took her back.

441
00:35:03,731 --> 00:35:05,629
Him?

442
00:35:06,698 --> 00:35:08,130
Alive.

443
00:35:09,531 --> 00:35:12,224
It has been somewhat touch and go.

444
00:35:13,731 --> 00:35:15,663
Not since the Holy Land have I seen...

445
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:20,894
It took all my powers to calm him.

446
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,819
And... and hers.

447
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:32,055
But it was I who fetched her.
So you could say it was all my doing.

448
00:35:32,729 --> 00:35:34,127
We need him.

449
00:35:40,696 --> 00:35:43,457
- We go to Nottingham.
- I thought you were going.

450
00:35:45,355 --> 00:35:47,089
I have unfinished business here.

451
00:35:47,495 --> 00:35:51,391
- It's Djaq...
- The Sheriff will be expecting a rescue.

452
00:35:51,395 --> 00:35:54,522
It is better to wait. To think.

453
00:35:54,595 --> 00:35:56,288
Robin, wake up! It's Djaq!

454
00:35:57,195 --> 00:36:01,287
You are thinking of just one man. I am thinking
of the King and the whole of England.

455
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:03,759
Djaq is not "one man", she's a woman!

456
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,259
Have you thought what could happen
if the Sheriff realizes?

457
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:09,225
"Jack" is a woman? The Saracen?

458
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:10,953
- Long story.
- He can wait.

459
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:13,683
- Djaq cannot.
- No.

460
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,222
- If they know we're coming, we could all die.
- True. But it's Djaq.

461
00:36:18,293 --> 00:36:21,225
What does that mean, "True, but it's Djaq"?
It's not even an answer!

462
00:36:21,293 --> 00:36:23,691
But the thing is...

463
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,282
- I like her...
- I think I love her.

464
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,121
Well!

465
00:36:37,959 --> 00:36:40,254
Even then, that is...

466
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:42,688
that is no reason to knowingly walk into a trap.

467
00:36:42,758 --> 00:36:44,747
Robin is right. You need to think.

468
00:36:44,858 --> 00:36:47,017
Look. That is your solution.

469
00:36:47,092 --> 00:36:48,648
- Trade him for her.
- No!

470
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:52,950
I am not letting him get away with this.

471
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:54,490
Robin...

472
00:36:58,757 --> 00:37:00,723
Not sorry.

473
00:37:01,757 --> 00:37:04,200
NOTTINGHAM CASTLE

474
00:37:04,257 --> 00:37:06,950
- Has he talked yet?
- He's just about to start.

475
00:37:08,156 --> 00:37:09,622
Well, hurry up then.

476
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,489
Try and do it quietly. I can't bear bawling.

477
00:37:17,723 --> 00:37:19,712
My Lord Sheriff.

478
00:37:20,689 --> 00:37:22,019
I need your help.

479
00:37:28,089 --> 00:37:30,453
They said to give you this.

480
00:37:30,922 --> 00:37:32,979
Said you'd understand.

481
00:37:33,055 --> 00:37:34,520
This um...

482
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:36,214
This outlaw. He didn't rob you?

483
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:38,254
He was only interested in the exchange.

484
00:37:38,321 --> 00:37:40,412
Guy for your prisoner.

485
00:37:40,488 --> 00:37:42,716
My husband-to-be for a Saracen.

486
00:37:42,788 --> 00:37:46,049
You see, something is not right.

487
00:37:47,254 --> 00:37:49,549
How do I know this isn't an outlaw ruse?

488
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:53,575
Guy is your Lieutenant, your ally...
Your friend.

489
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:56,184
Friend?

490
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:02,747
We are talking about the same Guy?
I mean, I hardly noticed he was missing.

491
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,309
My Lord Sheriff, please.

492
00:38:04,387 --> 00:38:06,182
They have Guy.

493
00:38:06,253 --> 00:38:09,912
If they should do anything to him, I...

494
00:38:09,986 --> 00:38:11,315
Yes, all right.

495
00:38:13,852 --> 00:38:16,375
Might just stop your sniveling.

496
00:38:16,453 --> 00:38:20,612
The outlaws will kill Guy
if you harm the Saracen boy.

497
00:38:20,685 --> 00:38:21,708
Have you harmed him?

498
00:38:23,785 --> 00:38:25,114
No.

499
00:38:31,618 --> 00:38:33,981
OK. Prepare the Saracen for travel.

500
00:38:46,983 --> 00:38:48,710
Where is he?

501
00:38:48,783 --> 00:38:50,147
They've taken him.

502
00:38:52,616 --> 00:38:53,980
It was the only way. For Djaq...

503
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:57,675
It was not their decision to make.
Where have they gone?

504
00:38:58,416 --> 00:39:00,712
- Where?
- I'm not gonna tell you.

505
00:39:03,016 --> 00:39:05,380
- Please, you can't make me.
- If you are my friend.

506
00:39:06,216 --> 00:39:09,978
If you are my true friend,
you must do this one thing for me.

507
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,713
Please.

508
00:39:24,614 --> 00:39:27,239
Robin Hood has gone to
a lot of trouble for you, pretty boy.

509
00:39:27,314 --> 00:39:30,337
Not one rescue, but two.

510
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,572
- He didn't come the first time.
- Aw. Are you feeling unloved?

511
00:39:41,181 --> 00:39:43,237
Ah!

512
00:39:43,313 --> 00:39:46,711
Ah, pretty boy. Not a pretty boy at all!

513
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,143
No wonder they want you
back in the forest, hm?

514
00:39:49,213 --> 00:39:51,838
All those long, cold nights!

515
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:54,508
Well, obviously...

516
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:56,568
you won't be going back.

517
00:39:57,379 --> 00:39:59,902
You see Hood, he thinks there
are two tunnels that are clear.

518
00:39:59,979 --> 00:40:01,910
One in, one out. Clever...

519
00:40:01,978 --> 00:40:03,944
But not clever enough.

520
00:40:09,745 --> 00:40:11,143
Where 's Hood?

521
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:14,275
Here.

522
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:17,140
Robin. No!

523
00:40:17,211 --> 00:40:18,904
I did not agree to this trade, John.

524
00:40:18,977 --> 00:40:22,501
- Dissent in the ranks?
- I did not agree to this trade.

525
00:40:24,677 --> 00:40:26,041
But I should have done.

526
00:40:26,111 --> 00:40:27,440
Let him go.

527
00:40:28,544 --> 00:40:30,476
It's all right, Hood. Your secret's out, hm?

528
00:40:30,544 --> 00:40:32,009
Your pet Saracen...

529
00:40:32,077 --> 00:40:33,441
is a lady, hm?

530
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:37,067
The great thing is, she gave me this.

531
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,371
Your secret's out, too.

532
00:40:39,444 --> 00:40:43,398
There is no way Gisborne went to the Holy Land
without your say-so.

533
00:40:43,476 --> 00:40:45,601
Holy Land? Gisborne?

534
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:49,903
I have proof. On his arm. His tattoo.

535
00:40:49,975 --> 00:40:54,408
People in the King's Guard know about that
tattoo, and when they return, he will pay.

536
00:40:55,642 --> 00:40:57,006
And you will pay.

537
00:40:58,076 --> 00:40:59,541
Tattoo?

538
00:41:02,575 --> 00:41:04,507
- What tattoo?
- No!

539
00:41:04,575 --> 00:41:05,938
Shut up, you big jester!

540
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:08,906
- Let's go.
- You're not going anywhere. Guards!

541
00:41:10,475 --> 00:41:12,270
Look, an old tunnel! Surprise!

542
00:41:12,342 --> 00:41:15,466
- Gotcha!
- Surprise. An old shaft.

543
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:16,802
- Surprise.
- Let's go.

544
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:18,305
Go!

545
00:41:19,973 --> 00:41:21,200
Go!

546
00:41:21,274 --> 00:41:23,103
Another time, Gisborne.

547
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,001
Djaq.

548
00:41:35,006 --> 00:41:36,529
Get on them!

549
00:41:36,606 --> 00:41:38,094
- Get John out.
- Pull!

550
00:41:40,406 --> 00:41:41,598
Pull!

551
00:41:50,905 --> 00:41:53,837
Stop mewling, Gisborne.

552
00:41:53,905 --> 00:41:58,361
Maybe in future you'll think twice
before painting your arm like a girl.

553
00:42:12,304 --> 00:42:13,270
Is it true?

554
00:42:13,338 --> 00:42:16,667
There could have been peace
without this Gisborne?

555
00:42:18,737 --> 00:42:20,896
And yet you gave him up for me?

556
00:42:45,868 --> 00:42:47,198
Brought you some food.
