1
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,635
Ah! The Great Pact of Nottingham.

2
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,757
All drawn up and ready for signature?

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,173
Safe in your quarters?

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,037
Good, good.

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,430
And you've told
nobody about your work?

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,455
The scribe is mute, my Lord.

7
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,079
Mute? Are we sure?

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,059
Oh, look! Look!

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,077
The Black Knights. On their
way to the castle to sign the pact!

10
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,560
Now we're sure.

11
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,438
Is this what you're looking for?

12
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,257
Your blood money. Betray your
friends for a few measly pennies.

13
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,673
Traitor! Look, I'm sorry, all right?

14
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,399
I'm really sorry...

15
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,972
Really... I never wanted...

16
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,414
HORSES APPROACH

17
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,733
Is that who I think it was?

18
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,200
The Black Knights, heading for
Nottingham. What are they up to?

19
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,574
I'm going in.

20
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,754
What about Allan? Forget him.

21
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,320
He's dead to us.

22
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,410
Meet back at the camp in one hour.

23
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,937
Well, you can't just decide
to go like this and go!

24
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,852
Without planning... without us!

25
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,138
Yes, I can! It's the Black Knights!

26
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:13,018
Why does he do this? Why does he
always, always do this?

27
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,421
What are these in aid of, Sir Guy?

28
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,561
A bit of colour for you.

29
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,473
I was wondering if you would
accompany me to the celebrations
today.

30
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,121
What are we celebrating? The King's
birthday.

31
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,912
What are we really celebrating?

32
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,370
Does it matter?

33
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,141
It's the signing
of an important document.

34
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,531
Something tells me it is a
document which I won't approve of.

35
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,695
Well, Marian, you should approve,
because this document brings
me closer to real power.

36
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,659
And that, in turn, benefits you.

37
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,050
COULD benefit you...

38
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,540
in time.

39
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,353
Meanwhile, there's a
pretty dress in it for you.

40
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,557
Am I so easily won?

41
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,553
You must be the least
easily won woman in England.

42
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:57,777
Well, if that's my reputation,
then perhaps nobody will mind
if I do not attend...

43
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,911
Choose a dress. Guy...

44
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,478
What are you doing here?

45
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,279
Just dropping in on you.

46
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,671
So, the Black Knights
are assembling.

47
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:18,118
Did you hear Gisborne? They're
signing an important document.

48
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,840
Who died? The Sheriff's scribe.

49
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,775
Fell from the battlements.

50
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,113
Outlived his usefulness. What?

51
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,681
Dead scribes, Black Knights...

52
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,992
Something tells me we have to find
this document.

53
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,110
Not being funny... your guards.
Useless!

54
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,817
You need smarter people on your team.

55
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,970
And that's you, is it?

56
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,938
Well...

57
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,591
Hood found you out?

58
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,278
Maybe.

59
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,752
Don't insult me.

60
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,155
All right. I need your help.

61
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,574
I've lost everything cos I
helped you, so you owe me.

62
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,470
I owe you nothing.

63
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,578
I paid you.

64
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,980
Take me on, Guy, come on.

65
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,074
You won't regret it.

66
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,841
Go and get one of my
servants to give you some food.

67
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,777
Ah, nice. Where you off to, then?

68
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:46,091
Get yourself cleaned up.
Come and find me at the castle.

69
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,531
This is it. The scribe's room.

70
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:17,593
...Better get a move on. Down at
the front gate again on guard...

71
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,934
Robin. This isn't the time...

72
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,050
Will that work?

73
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:36,420
Trust me, I've done this before.
With which girl's hairpin?

74
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,072
LOCK CLICKS

75
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,938
"The Great Pact of Nottingham.

76
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,340
"We, the undersigned, by the
affixing of our seals of office
and nobility,

77
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,413
"hereby undertake to remove
King Richard from the throne.

78
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:04,211
"By his lasting absence, he
demonstrates his scant regard for
the welfare of his subjects."

79
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,290
This is outrageous!

80
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:11,058
"We further undertake to replace the
said Richard with his brother, John,
Prince of the realm."

81
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,372
The Sheriff is making the Black
Knights sign their allegiance.

82
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,179
This is a traitors' charter.

83
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,255
Looks like the Sheriff
has made some new friends.

84
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,514
Buckingham, Spencer...

85
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,853
Winchester?

86
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,774
Surely not.
He's an old friend of my father.

87
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,760
DOOR SLAMS

88
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,972
When the Pact is signed, there
can be no going back for our friends.

89
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,614
And enjoy this party.

90
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,897
Nobody here.

91
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,173
Look at this.

92
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,957
The colour,
the detail, the tone texture.

93
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,339
This man was a true artist.

94
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,115
I'm sorry I killed him, though.

95
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,793
A clue...

96
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,200
No.

97
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,518
Door.

98
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,790
Go, go...

99
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:48,033
I cannot believe Winchester would
willingly be involved
in this revolt.

100
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,032
Winchester controls the south coast.

101
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,773
The Sheriff wants to intercept the
King's landing. But Winchester?!

102
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:58,321
I've known him since we were boys.
The Sheriff must have got to him.

103
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:03,395
Good. Good? If the Sheriff
can get to him, then so can I.

104
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,641
Edward, I'll be back.

105
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,440
And when I get back, I
will get you out of this place.

106
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,937
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

107
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:15,433
What should I do?
Be meek and obedient, my child.

108
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,399
Until I know more.

109
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,119
Jailer, confession's over.

110
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,796
Why have we stopped?

111
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,037
Oh. Move it!

112
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,370
My Lord Winchester, I'm a friend.
I know you are coming to Nottingham

113
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,794
to sign the Sheriff's pact. I don't
know what you're talking about.

114
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,099
My name is Robin Hood.

115
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,796
We haven't got time for games.

116
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,180
Robin! Forgive me, I... have to
be careful.

117
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,774
We have a mutual friend.

118
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,560
Sir Edward, the former Sheriff
of Nottingham. Edward, how is he?
In the Sheriff's dungeons.

119
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,896
Good God. What can we do?
First, we need to kill this pact.

120
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,439
Spencer and Buckingham
are signing under duress, too.

121
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,081
Lf, at the moment of signing, you
were to refuse,

122
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,313
the Black Knights would lose
faith and the Sheriff's pact
would be history.

123
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:21,191
That's dangerous. The Sheriff would
turn his men on me. That's where I
come in, you need support.

124
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,632
Forgive me. I am a peace-loving man.

125
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,770
I want only stability and
the Sheriff is offering me that...

126
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,078
What they don't know...

127
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,834
is that I've already sent a
messenger to the King.

128
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,675
Roger of Stoke. By now, the King
will already know about this plot.

129
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,834
When he returns to England, the
first thing he will do is crush
the Black Knights.

130
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:46,595
If you love peace, do anything,
but do not sign the Sheriff's pact.

131
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,639
Ahhh... Count me in.

132
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,151
Right, lads, work to do.

133
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,415
We're going to the castle. Why?

134
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,914
Why? To save England,
Marian and her father.

135
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,620
They're hosting a celebration
for the King's birthday. Except
it's really a celebration

136
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,192
for the Black Knights
signing the pact.

137
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,956
Will, you need to find us a way
of getting into this party.

138
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,872
I've already done it. How?

139
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,317
The castle announced
this party weeks ago.

140
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,450
Put out a call
for entertainers and players.

141
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:33,138
And it gave me an idea.

142
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,497
It's a recurve bow!

143
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,038
Djaq? It's a flute.

144
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,075
What does this do? Much, don't!

145
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,015
Sorry!

146
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,614
This is for you.

147
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,297
Will, you're a genius!

148
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,451
And a magician. That's brilliant.

149
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,419
You crafty craftsman!

150
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,753
What about me? Ah.

151
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,917
These are for you.

152
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,298
Bells? What do they do?

153
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,690
Oh, they're just bells.

154
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,316
Thanks.

155
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:27,000
FANFARE PLAYS

156
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:31,549
Delighted...

157
00:12:31,545 --> 00:12:33,797
to welcome Harold of Winchester...

158
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:36,995
to join our celebrations
for the King's birthday.

159
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,435
Thank you, Marian.

160
00:12:39,674 --> 00:12:43,041
We sign in one hour. Marvellous.

161
00:12:43,037 --> 00:12:45,210
I was ungrateful earlier.

162
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,454
I'm sorry. I was over-bearing.

163
00:12:48,443 --> 00:12:50,934
Can I have word
in private with you first?

164
00:12:50,926 --> 00:12:53,611
I'd like to talk to your
predecessor, if I may.

165
00:12:53,603 --> 00:12:56,572
Yes, well, Sir Edward is,
how shall I put it, indisposed.

166
00:12:56,563 --> 00:12:58,531
In what way? He's in the dungeons.

167
00:12:58,523 --> 00:13:02,584
No, really? He's loyal to the King.

168
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:06,053
And also, a right royal
pain in the derriere.

169
00:13:06,043 --> 00:13:12,243
I'd still like to talk to him,
if you have no objections.
Yes, well, it can be arranged.

170
00:13:12,243 --> 00:13:15,246
Gisborne will show you to
your quarters.

171
00:13:15,763 --> 00:13:17,128
Keep an eye on him.

172
00:13:18,243 --> 00:13:21,132
This way, my Lord.

173
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:26,723
My Lord?

174
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,408
This way. Ah... yes.

175
00:13:34,403 --> 00:13:36,485
Reason for visit?

176
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,507
Security check.

177
00:13:37,503 --> 00:13:40,210
No knives, no weapons in the castle.

178
00:13:41,643 --> 00:13:44,692
We're the band, the minstrels.

179
00:13:54,063 --> 00:13:55,883
Will. Allan! Much.

180
00:14:00,643 --> 00:14:04,306
I'm Sir Guy's man.
Can you let me pass? In you go.

181
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:09,025
What's he doing here?

182
00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:11,332
He's being "Sir Guy's Man".

183
00:14:11,323 --> 00:14:12,472
Unbelievable.

184
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:15,068
Did you see what he was wearing?!
Unbelievable.

185
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,644
Whose is this?

186
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:22,849
I said, whose is this?

187
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:26,785
It's mine.

188
00:14:29,543 --> 00:14:31,750
A bit's come off, sorry...

189
00:14:31,743 --> 00:14:35,247
That's all right. I'm good with wood.

190
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:40,147
Er, bells, mate.

191
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,507
You know what to do. I'm off
to see Winchester. Wait here.

192
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,984
Oh! Cake.

193
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:23,391
What?

194
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:26,546
Had to put something on, didn't I?

195
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:29,831
I suppose you want me to introduce
you to the Sheriff now, do you?

196
00:15:31,183 --> 00:15:34,550
Yeah. Wait through there.

197
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:42,829
Go in there and get yourselves ready.

198
00:15:42,823 --> 00:15:46,907
Er... Of course,
we'll go in there and... tune up.

199
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:53,832
We can't possibly go in there.
Allan. Why not?

200
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:57,803
We, er, never share dressing rooms.

201
00:15:57,803 --> 00:16:00,465
You're already dressed.

202
00:16:00,463 --> 00:16:03,910
It's the principle. We're artists.

203
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:08,427
He's the drummer.

204
00:16:15,823 --> 00:16:19,805
My men are safely in the castle. I
heard you could walk through walls.

205
00:16:19,803 --> 00:16:25,014
Your meeting will take place in the
War Room. I'll be there. It will be
strictly Black Knights only.

206
00:16:25,003 --> 00:16:27,471
Then I shall be a Black Knight.
Confident.

207
00:16:27,463 --> 00:16:31,411
Determined. My men will be
waiting outside the War Room.

208
00:16:31,403 --> 00:16:36,511
When you've said your piece,
I'll cover for you and you run.
My men will secure your safe exit.

209
00:16:36,503 --> 00:16:38,425
Thank you. What about you?

210
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:41,870
Well, I can walk through walls.
Remember?

211
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:43,683
Good luck. You too.

212
00:16:43,683 --> 00:16:45,207
And thank you.

213
00:16:51,683 --> 00:16:58,589
Tell me something. What do you know
about a messenger sent by Robin Hood
to the King, telling of our plans?

214
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,130
Roger of Stoke?

215
00:17:00,123 --> 00:17:01,829
Don't worry about him.

216
00:17:01,823 --> 00:17:04,291
He got lost en route. Well done.

217
00:17:05,823 --> 00:17:09,031
If I may be allowed
to speak to Sir Edward in private?

218
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:13,383
Edward.

219
00:17:13,383 --> 00:17:15,510
Harry! My old friend.

220
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:17,186
What has happened to you?

221
00:17:17,183 --> 00:17:19,629
Sit down.

222
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:26,071
I've had a visit
from a friend of yours.

223
00:17:26,063 --> 00:17:32,263
Robin. Excellent. He advised me not
to back the wrong horse.

224
00:17:32,263 --> 00:17:35,528
But then, I look where
you've ended up... Harry?

225
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:39,505
I could back you, Edward. And end
up stuck in a cell with vermin.

226
00:17:39,503 --> 00:17:42,973
Or I could back the Sheriff and
just get richer and more powerful.

227
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:45,147
Rats or riches?

228
00:17:45,143 --> 00:17:46,747
It's a tough choice.

229
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:48,404
Harry.

230
00:17:48,403 --> 00:17:51,987
You cannot sign the pact.
Oh, I will sign the pact.

231
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:54,565
You are mad if you think
you can trust the Sheriff.

232
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:56,645
Trust? Oh, no,

233
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:59,885
I don't trust anyone.
You taught me that,

234
00:17:59,883 --> 00:18:02,010
when you stole the woman I loved.

235
00:18:02,003 --> 00:18:03,527
Jailer?

236
00:18:03,523 --> 00:18:04,785
Kate?!

237
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:08,312
She chose me, Harold.
I didn't steal her.

238
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:09,884
I was just thinking of her.

239
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:13,910
I thought I saw her outside
just now. A young woman,
the very image of Kate...

240
00:18:15,883 --> 00:18:17,851
She's your daughter!

241
00:18:17,843 --> 00:18:21,324
Of course! She's her mother's
double.

242
00:18:21,323 --> 00:18:23,371
Well done, Edward.

243
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:26,423
We wouldn't want her inheriting
your looks, now, would we?

244
00:18:29,123 --> 00:18:31,307
Oh, oh, oh...

245
00:18:31,883 --> 00:18:33,965
I've just had an idea.

246
00:18:33,963 --> 00:18:39,993
If I couldn't have the mother...
What's her name, hmmm?

247
00:18:39,983 --> 00:18:42,213
Your little precious pea? No!

248
00:18:42,203 --> 00:18:44,091
No? That's not her name, now is it?

249
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:48,372
No! Harry, she's got nothing
to do with this. Please!

250
00:18:48,363 --> 00:18:50,206
I don't think he likes me any more.

251
00:18:51,123 --> 00:18:53,045
Please!

252
00:19:03,723 --> 00:19:07,932
Harry... you wanted a word?

253
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:12,171
What was the word?

254
00:19:13,843 --> 00:19:16,448
Sussex. Sussex?

255
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:19,048
Sussex.

256
00:19:20,363 --> 00:19:21,728
Sussex.

257
00:19:21,723 --> 00:19:24,624
I want it. Sussex?

258
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:29,007
I hold the key to the success of
your plan. It's come to my attention

259
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:33,884
that Buckingham and Spencer are
nervous. They'll do as they're told.
Not if they see me falter.

260
00:19:33,883 --> 00:19:38,206
Not if they think you don't have
access to where King Richard
is most likely to land.

261
00:19:38,203 --> 00:19:41,889
I have therefore decided that my
price for helping you is Sussex.
Oh...

262
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:44,488
and some of Surrey.

263
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,450
Harry...

264
00:19:54,283 --> 00:19:56,934
Very good, very good.
Almost had me there.

265
00:19:56,923 --> 00:19:57,969
No, I'm serious.

266
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:02,491
If you want this pact signed,
it will cost you Sussex. And some of
Surrey. Surrey...

267
00:20:02,483 --> 00:20:06,567
And the girl. What girl?
Er... Marian. No! Shut up.

268
00:20:06,563 --> 00:20:09,805
You still gain Warwick, Lincoln
and Cambridge.

269
00:20:09,803 --> 00:20:12,089
And... some of Surrey.

270
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:15,610
Oh, and I have something to
offer you. A little bonus.

271
00:20:15,603 --> 00:20:21,485
A little... sweetener. Still, if
you're not playing...

272
00:20:45,683 --> 00:20:49,084
You get Sussex.

273
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:53,409
I keep Surrey.

274
00:20:53,943 --> 00:20:57,128
Oh, you drive a hard bargain.

275
00:20:58,743 --> 00:21:01,473
It's a deal. Marian stays.
Not negotiable, sorry.

276
00:21:01,463 --> 00:21:04,068
Personal thing. I won't bore you
with the details.

277
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:07,567
The girl and Sussex
and then you sign?

278
00:21:08,943 --> 00:21:11,468
Pleasure doing business with you.
My Lord...

279
00:21:11,463 --> 00:21:13,351
Harry? Hmm?

280
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:16,653
What was the sweetener? Later.

281
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:19,453
You'll like it.

282
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:26,043
You cannot give him Marian!
I have lost Sussex!

283
00:21:26,043 --> 00:21:27,670
SUSSEX!

284
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:30,268
And all you can do
is bleat about a girl!

285
00:21:30,263 --> 00:21:32,311
I want a hanging!

286
00:21:32,303 --> 00:21:36,091
What? Find me somebody to hang.
I want to see somebody twitch.

287
00:21:36,823 --> 00:21:39,712
My Lord, this man said you
were going to see him. Not now!

288
00:21:39,703 --> 00:21:43,753
You'll do. For what? Hang him. What?!
No, this man works for me. So?

289
00:21:43,743 --> 00:21:47,349
So, he was my spy in Hood's camp.
Was? Hood found him out.

290
00:21:47,343 --> 00:21:52,588
Served his purpose then, hasn't he?
He might still prove useful. You're
not listening to me, Gisborne!

291
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:56,110
Find that lady leper friend and take
her to see Lord Winchester.

292
00:21:56,103 --> 00:21:59,231
Then bring him before me with a
hood over his head!

293
00:21:59,223 --> 00:22:01,145
Hang on a minute. I'm on your team
now!

294
00:22:01,143 --> 00:22:03,771
And I can help, honest. Guy!

295
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:07,350
Lah... di-dah di-dah.

296
00:22:09,103 --> 00:22:10,547
Guy?

297
00:22:10,543 --> 00:22:14,593
Hang on, let me say something here,
right? Guy! Come on, you can't be
serious.

298
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,914
Just take him away. What?

299
00:22:15,903 --> 00:22:18,474
Guy, what are you doing?

300
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:31,393
Psst! I'm not hungry.

301
00:22:33,203 --> 00:22:37,105
Robin, thank heavens... Shhhh. I
haven't got much time.

302
00:22:37,103 --> 00:22:41,403
The Sheriff is about to have his
meeting. And Winchester is going to
refuse to sign.

303
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:43,428
There'll be absolute chaos.

304
00:22:43,423 --> 00:22:46,233
And in that chaos, I intend to come
down and get you out.

305
00:22:48,763 --> 00:22:52,233
What? Winchester is going to sign.

306
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:55,112
He's a traitor. A traitor?

307
00:22:56,403 --> 00:22:58,064
And he wants Marian.

308
00:22:59,263 --> 00:23:01,288
Marian? What for?

309
00:23:01,283 --> 00:23:05,231
Revenge. Against me. What?

310
00:23:05,223 --> 00:23:08,124
He thinks I took his woman.

311
00:23:08,123 --> 00:23:11,263
So he's going to take my daughter.

312
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,071
Robin?

313
00:23:18,423 --> 00:23:19,583
Then I have no choice.

314
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,905
What? What are you going to do?

315
00:23:25,143 --> 00:23:26,667
God speed, Edward.

316
00:23:29,903 --> 00:23:35,523
Guy, at least do me the courtesy of
knocking... Get your possessions.
You're leaving.

317
00:23:35,523 --> 00:23:41,143
What? Now! Why? Winchester's made a
deal with the Sheriff, you've become
part of a negotiation.

318
00:23:41,143 --> 00:23:44,670
Pardon? Winchester wants you.

319
00:23:47,143 --> 00:23:49,134
Tell him he can't have me.

320
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:51,910
The Sheriff has agreed.
I cannot protect you.

321
00:23:51,903 --> 00:23:57,330
Listen to me. You have to run. Now.
I can't! My father... I will take
care of your father.

322
00:23:57,323 --> 00:24:01,066
I cannot leave him. Why do you
always resist? I'm attempting
to help you.

323
00:24:01,063 --> 00:24:03,167
I know, I can see
that and I'm grateful.

324
00:24:03,163 --> 00:24:06,394
If the Sheriff knew I was doing
this, my life would be in danger.

325
00:24:06,383 --> 00:24:08,112
Why do you work for him?

326
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,826
I have nobody. So you choose him?

327
00:24:12,823 --> 00:24:15,826
So I choose power. He is my
route to position, standing.

328
00:24:15,823 --> 00:24:18,132
He is mad, you know that.

329
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,693
No. He's single-minded.

330
00:24:19,683 --> 00:24:23,392
He does not allow... distractions
to divert him from his course.

331
00:24:23,383 --> 00:24:25,931
Distractions? Like a little
humanity?

332
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,811
Humanity is weakness.

333
00:24:27,803 --> 00:24:29,543
You don't believe that.

334
00:24:31,443 --> 00:24:33,024
You must leave this place.

335
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:36,468
This money will secure your passage.

336
00:24:36,463 --> 00:24:40,103
I have instructed a man on
the west gate to let you out.

337
00:24:42,203 --> 00:24:44,546
Marian.

338
00:24:47,643 --> 00:24:49,463
Good luck.

339
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:54,427
Go! Now!

340
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:57,607
Excellent.

341
00:25:00,723 --> 00:25:04,170
Taking the lady to see her new lord?

342
00:25:04,163 --> 00:25:07,143
My Lord...

343
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:15,728
As my lieutenant, Gisborne, you
sit at the right hand of the father.

344
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:21,093
You will share in the fruits
of OUR labour.

345
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:26,487
You will be a god amongst men.

346
00:25:28,003 --> 00:25:32,906
As long as I can trust you.

347
00:25:37,403 --> 00:25:41,806
Take Lady Marian to Winchester.

348
00:25:51,323 --> 00:25:53,564
This? Oh, well...

349
00:25:53,563 --> 00:25:56,214
Tunisian, actually.

350
00:25:56,203 --> 00:25:59,013
Yeah, we tour all over the place,

351
00:25:59,003 --> 00:26:01,790
London, Lincoln, er... Hull.

352
00:26:01,783 --> 00:26:03,171
Right, come on.

353
00:26:03,643 --> 00:26:08,205
We're in the middle of something
here. We have to go warn Marian.
Now, come on! Marian?

354
00:26:34,203 --> 00:26:37,923
Guy? Marian...

355
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:43,363
I'm sorry.

356
00:26:46,283 --> 00:26:48,126
Sheriff's instructions.

357
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:51,149
What? Get off me. Guy!

358
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:54,965
Get off me, get off me! Guy!

359
00:26:56,763 --> 00:26:59,004
KNOCK AT DOOR

360
00:26:59,003 --> 00:27:00,971
Enter.

361
00:27:02,323 --> 00:27:04,006
Ah, the icing on my cake!

362
00:27:04,003 --> 00:27:08,167
Daddy's little girl.
I will not be treated like this.

363
00:27:08,163 --> 00:27:09,687
You're quite right.

364
00:27:09,683 --> 00:27:14,108
These handcuffs and leg irons, could
they be made a little tighter?

365
00:27:14,103 --> 00:27:18,767
How dare you?! Oh, gag her for God's
sake. She's pretty till she talks.
To business. Come on!

366
00:27:36,183 --> 00:27:38,492
She's not here. What's the problem?

367
00:27:38,483 --> 00:27:40,144
I wanted to talk to her before...

368
00:27:40,143 --> 00:27:45,831
Before what? What do we have
to warn her about?

369
00:27:49,963 --> 00:27:51,965
Robin! Much...

370
00:27:58,563 --> 00:28:00,349
"My dearest Marian.

371
00:28:00,343 --> 00:28:03,653
"I fear we may not meet again...

372
00:28:03,643 --> 00:28:06,168
"in this life.

373
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,292
"For the things I did wrong...

374
00:28:17,143 --> 00:28:19,987
"for the things I am about to do...

375
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,331
"but mostly for the life,

376
00:28:23,323 --> 00:28:25,712
"for the love we could not have...

377
00:28:28,563 --> 00:28:30,827
"I am truly sorry."

378
00:28:33,823 --> 00:28:36,371
I want you to give
this note to Marian.

379
00:28:36,363 --> 00:28:37,967
What for?

380
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:43,853
There's been a change of plan.
I want you to wait here for her.

381
00:28:45,563 --> 00:28:49,727
Aren't we supposed to help you and
Winchester escape? Yes, after
the showdown.

382
00:28:49,723 --> 00:28:53,944
I'll deal with Winchester.
Use the distraction to go and
release Sir Edward.

383
00:28:53,943 --> 00:28:57,208
Then take him and Marian to the
forest. I will meet you there.

384
00:28:57,203 --> 00:28:59,603
How are you and
Winchester going to escape?

385
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:02,948
If the castle guards find you...
Just do as I say.

386
00:29:04,383 --> 00:29:06,954
Please.

387
00:29:06,943 --> 00:29:09,093
I want you to give me your word.

388
00:29:15,803 --> 00:29:17,771
Good.

389
00:29:25,983 --> 00:29:28,611
And thank you, my friends.

390
00:29:40,043 --> 00:29:44,252
I have a message for you,
from King Richard.

391
00:29:50,283 --> 00:29:52,171
I don't like this.

392
00:29:52,163 --> 00:29:54,688
I hate it. It doesn't make sense.

393
00:29:54,683 --> 00:29:58,813
If Marian's in danger,
we should be looking for her.
Robin's up to something.

394
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:07,286
No, you cannot
open people's private letters!

395
00:30:10,223 --> 00:30:12,009
John?

396
00:30:13,223 --> 00:30:14,963
Read it.

397
00:30:26,703 --> 00:30:28,773
Read it for me.

398
00:30:33,463 --> 00:30:35,351
"My dearest Marian.

399
00:30:35,343 --> 00:30:38,187
"I fear we may not meet again...

400
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:41,710
"in this life." What?

401
00:30:41,703 --> 00:30:45,628
"We're both to be betrayed
by Winchester..."

402
00:30:45,623 --> 00:30:50,344
"I cannot allow it. All the Black
Knights will be gathered together.

403
00:30:50,343 --> 00:30:55,474
"Winchester, Durham, Rotherham and
the rest of the Sheriff's
traitorous gang.

404
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,230
"I may never have the chance again.

405
00:31:03,103 --> 00:31:05,389
"I cannot allow this opportunity
to pass.

406
00:31:07,983 --> 00:31:10,008
"I must kill them.

407
00:31:14,263 --> 00:31:16,504
"I only hope you remember me well.

408
00:31:16,503 --> 00:31:18,971
"Forgive the brutality
of what I'm going to do.

409
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,106
"If England is to live...

410
00:31:25,103 --> 00:31:27,105
"they must die.

411
00:31:27,103 --> 00:31:29,970
"And so, I fear, must I.

412
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:36,587
"Go to the woods, to fight again.

413
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,824
"Go with my lads.

414
00:31:38,823 --> 00:31:40,632
"I will see you in heaven."

415
00:31:40,623 --> 00:31:42,705
Let the walls enclose us.

416
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,204
"Goodbye, my love."

417
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:53,810
My friends, we are
a brotherhood of steel.

418
00:31:55,303 --> 00:31:57,305
And our time has come.

419
00:31:57,303 --> 00:32:02,229
As a sign of my unbending fastness
to the cause,

420
00:32:02,223 --> 00:32:05,147
I, Vaizey, Sheriff of this shire,

421
00:32:05,143 --> 00:32:11,150
do add my name to
the Great Pact of Nottingham.

422
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:15,448
And I do make my mark.

423
00:32:19,903 --> 00:32:23,543
Next to add his name,

424
00:32:23,543 --> 00:32:25,352
the Lord Winchester.

425
00:32:34,223 --> 00:32:37,067
As a sign of my unbending fastness
to the cause,

426
00:32:37,063 --> 00:32:39,748
I, Harold, Lord of Winchester,

427
00:32:39,743 --> 00:32:45,386
do add my name to this
Great Pact of Nottingham.

428
00:32:47,143 --> 00:32:51,170
And I do make my mark.

429
00:32:55,663 --> 00:32:57,870
Traitors! Robin Hood!

430
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:08,833
Winchester, the death of every
man in this room is on your head.

431
00:33:10,663 --> 00:33:16,545
Sheriff, Gisborne, say your prayers.

432
00:33:20,723 --> 00:33:24,545
Hood. Forgive me...

433
00:33:45,043 --> 00:33:47,386
Guards!

434
00:33:52,723 --> 00:33:55,294
Thank you, my Lord Winchester.

435
00:33:55,283 --> 00:34:00,528
A very good little sweetener indeed.
My pleasure.

436
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:04,027
Gisborne, don't hang your boy.
I've got a better idea.

437
00:34:05,163 --> 00:34:07,814
Cake on the terrace, gentlemen.

438
00:34:07,803 --> 00:34:10,647
If he dies, I die.
If he dies, I die.

439
00:34:10,643 --> 00:34:12,611
Halt! Been looking for you.

440
00:34:12,603 --> 00:34:16,004
Us? How come?

441
00:34:16,003 --> 00:34:18,324
The Sheriff wants musicians outside.

442
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:20,268
They've caught Robin Hood.

443
00:34:46,963 --> 00:34:50,410
Behold the outlaw!

444
00:34:52,603 --> 00:34:56,004
The... invincible...

445
00:34:56,003 --> 00:34:57,868
and legendary Robin Hood.

446
00:34:57,863 --> 00:35:00,889
And his friend, Allan A Dale.

447
00:35:02,123 --> 00:35:06,048
How fitting, then, that these
two renegades,

448
00:35:06,043 --> 00:35:10,764
these enemies of the law,
which makes them enemies of good
King Richard himself,

449
00:35:10,763 --> 00:35:15,803
should provide us with entertainment
on this, the day of the
King's birthday.

450
00:35:17,043 --> 00:35:20,012
Thank you, legendary Robin Hood.

451
00:35:22,363 --> 00:35:24,172
Now, the game is very simple.

452
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,290
Fight or fry!

453
00:35:26,283 --> 00:35:29,423
And of course,
the winner gets his freedom.

454
00:35:29,423 --> 00:35:31,323
Cake!

455
00:35:33,403 --> 00:35:35,325
Enjoy!

456
00:35:39,063 --> 00:35:40,769
Poke him, poke him!

457
00:35:46,283 --> 00:35:48,205
You don't have to do this, Allan.

458
00:35:48,203 --> 00:35:50,808
Don't give them the satisfaction.

459
00:35:50,803 --> 00:35:54,204
Even if you do kill me, they won't
let you go. Come on, poke him!

460
00:35:54,203 --> 00:35:57,206
You know, if you had listened,
you might have understood.

461
00:35:57,203 --> 00:36:00,366
You should have given
me a second chance, Robin.

462
00:36:12,483 --> 00:36:14,826
How did you get to be so low?

463
00:36:14,823 --> 00:36:17,986
That was always your problem, Robin.
So high and mighty.

464
00:36:17,983 --> 00:36:21,874
So much better than everyone else.
No, just better than you.

465
00:36:33,923 --> 00:36:35,891
Careful!

466
00:37:00,863 --> 00:37:06,369
Ah! Well, it looks like our little
Robin red-breast is about to
become fried chicken!

467
00:37:09,423 --> 00:37:11,414
Oh, I like this! Yes, it's very good!

468
00:37:15,243 --> 00:37:18,167
Music! I'll give him music.

469
00:37:21,563 --> 00:37:24,214
Outlaws! Get them!

470
00:37:30,903 --> 00:37:33,326
Robin! Stop him!

471
00:37:41,623 --> 00:37:43,204
John, thanks.

472
00:37:44,823 --> 00:37:47,212
Traitor! Oi!

473
00:37:47,703 --> 00:37:49,830
I let you in, but I'm
not letting you out.

474
00:37:55,383 --> 00:37:56,964
Told you I was good with wood.

475
00:37:58,623 --> 00:38:00,773
Time to disappear.

476
00:38:03,223 --> 00:38:04,793
What's he doing?

477
00:38:11,383 --> 00:38:12,771
Oh, no...

478
00:38:18,023 --> 00:38:19,672
This way!

479
00:38:25,143 --> 00:38:26,883
Guards!

480
00:38:37,003 --> 00:38:38,686
Guards!

481
00:38:44,683 --> 00:38:49,108
Well, you said it would be
entertaining, but that
was really something!

482
00:38:49,103 --> 00:38:51,173
And once again, gentlemen,

483
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:54,872
it was a pleasure doing
business with you. Bring the girl.

484
00:38:54,863 --> 00:38:56,444
Marian...

485
00:38:57,703 --> 00:38:59,967
Marian...

486
00:39:01,743 --> 00:39:06,612
I'm surprised you gave in
to his demands. I had to get
his signature!

487
00:39:08,383 --> 00:39:09,987
But now...

488
00:39:09,983 --> 00:39:13,248
I have his signature.

489
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:18,152
I'll send a squad of men. No.

490
00:39:18,143 --> 00:39:22,728
No, we do this one quietly.
Bring your boy.

491
00:39:43,663 --> 00:39:45,688
Home!

492
00:40:00,943 --> 00:40:02,433
Here they come.

493
00:40:03,263 --> 00:40:06,312
Get your hands off me.

494
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:09,750
Spirit! Just like your mother.

495
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:12,109
Will, you take out
the two outriders.

496
00:40:12,103 --> 00:40:16,346
Much, John, Djaq,
you cover me while I rescue Marian.

497
00:40:16,343 --> 00:40:19,392
What are they doing?
They're stopping!

498
00:40:23,983 --> 00:40:25,553
Why have we stopped?

499
00:40:30,063 --> 00:40:33,305
It's you! Yes, me.

500
00:40:33,303 --> 00:40:37,751
Did you really think that I would
just smile and let you have Sussex?

501
00:40:38,343 --> 00:40:41,983
A clue. No.

502
00:40:43,063 --> 00:40:44,348
Hmmm?

503
00:40:49,343 --> 00:40:50,787
Marian.

504
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,785
A little sweetener for you.

505
00:41:01,783 --> 00:41:04,024
A little bonus.

506
00:41:10,223 --> 00:41:12,191
You're safe now, Marian. Thank you.

507
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:22,029
Sweet. Very sweet.

508
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:42,091
What?

509
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,734
I'm trying to think of the good bit.

510
00:41:44,723 --> 00:41:48,250
Even on a bad day, there's
always something good.

511
00:41:48,243 --> 00:41:50,848
That's what my mother used to say.

512
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:55,689
But today, Winchester's betrayed us,
the pact has been signed.

513
00:41:55,683 --> 00:41:59,551
Allan is Gisborne's man.
Marian's galloped off.

514
00:42:03,323 --> 00:42:06,212
I mean, help me out here,
cos I'm struggling!

515
00:42:06,203 --> 00:42:07,966
Much, shut up.

516
00:42:14,643 --> 00:42:16,167
Robin's alive.

517
00:42:16,163 --> 00:42:17,892
That's a good thing.

518
00:42:17,883 --> 00:42:22,570
That's a very good thing. Because
for a minute there, that was
looking... Shut up, Much!

519
00:42:26,963 --> 00:42:29,443
And if I may say so...
Much, shut up!

520
00:42:34,283 --> 00:42:37,389
We can't just eat in silence!
Shut up, Much!

521
00:42:40,643 --> 00:42:42,531
We have to go back and get
that pact.

522
00:42:42,523 --> 00:42:44,445
It's proof of the Sheriff's treason.

523
00:42:44,443 --> 00:42:46,843
Raaaghhh! It's empty!

524
00:42:46,843 --> 00:42:50,791
We are gathered here to witness
my marvellous bird cage.

525
00:42:50,783 --> 00:42:52,489
Robin! Get me down!

526
00:42:52,483 --> 00:42:55,407
The Sheriff's selling Beatrice
to the Earl of Durham.

527
00:42:55,403 --> 00:42:57,974
We're here to escort the
prisoner to the Earl.

528
00:42:58,483 --> 00:43:00,690
Looking for me, Sheriff? Guards!

529
00:43:00,683 --> 00:43:03,231
Where's the pact? I don't have it.
