1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:03,749
AN OWL HOOTS

2
00:00:03,741 --> 00:00:05,151
KNOCKING

3
00:00:05,141 --> 00:00:06,551
KNOCKING CONTINUES

4
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:08,202
Come on...

5
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:14,182
How much longer...?
I'm almost through.

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,603
FOOTSTEPS

7
00:00:18,581 --> 00:00:21,425
(Shh. Someone's coming. Guards.)

8
00:00:26,421 --> 00:00:30,744
The castle's waking up. Time to go.
Now! We have to get the Pact
from the strongroom.

9
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:32,550
England's future depends on it.

10
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:36,170
Robin! No time! Will...

11
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:39,950
And quietly.

12
00:00:46,821 --> 00:00:48,470
There you go.

13
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:54,709
It's empty. Where's the Pact?!
Where's everything?

14
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:57,784
I don't know, but I do know
it's a good job nobody's heard us.

15
00:00:57,781 --> 00:00:59,430
Last time there were dogs!

16
00:00:59,421 --> 00:01:01,150
DOGS BARK AND SNARL

17
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:06,143
Run?!!

18
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:01,862
Are you not eating?

19
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:03,431
No.

20
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:07,946
John, we have to go back
and get that Pact.

21
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:09,147
It's proof of treason.

22
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:11,803
We show that to the King
and the Sheriff's history.

23
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:13,792
Robin,
we've no idea where it's hidden!

24
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:21,102
The alarm!

25
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:29,708
HORSE WHINNIES

26
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,266
HE GRUNTS

27
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:41,644
Who said money
doesn't grow on trees?

28
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:47,745
THE MEN CLAMOUR

29
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:49,868
I've no more than ten shillings!

30
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:52,944
Oh, here we go... Then why resist?

31
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:55,546
Tell the truth and we'll only
take a tenth. Lie...

32
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,192
...and we take it all.
It's the truth. Then show us!

33
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:04,051
I need every penny for the woman I
love. You're going to buy a woman?

34
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,429
To marry her!

35
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:09,389
Her father
borrowed money from Canon Birkley.

36
00:03:09,381 --> 00:03:13,442
Yeah, we know Birkley. Where Birkley
goes, the Sheriff's not far behind.

37
00:03:13,441 --> 00:03:16,126
Her father signed a bond of debt.

38
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:17,725
And now he can't pay?

39
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:19,268
Not easily, no. He's dead.

40
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:25,306
Oh, please, we're not
going to believe this?!

41
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:27,804
The bond
is locked away in the castle.

42
00:03:27,801 --> 00:03:31,965
And Beatrice will be in
service to the Canon until
her father's debts are paid.

43
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,169
That's why I need every shilling.
How much is the debt?

44
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:37,766
Two thousand pounds.

45
00:03:37,761 --> 00:03:39,843
Ten shillings
won't get you very far.

46
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:43,811
I pay what I can! I'll keep paying,
until Beatrice is free.

47
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:46,042
This gets better and better.

48
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,407
C'mere, you, get back...

49
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:50,889
If your story is true, my friend...

50
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:55,489
It is true! Of course it isn't true!
If your story is true...

51
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:59,770
If you really do have only
ten shillings, then we...

52
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:01,831
will pay off your debt.

53
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:04,927
What?! What? What happens if it IS
true? It isn't!

54
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:10,805
You see?

55
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:13,804
I told you. Ten shillings.

56
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:21,185
What are you doing?
It's all our money!

57
00:04:21,181 --> 00:04:24,389
We're robbing from the rich
to give to the... rich. Right.

58
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:26,747
It's to help him marry
his sweetheart, Will.

59
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:28,629
Think of it as a wedding present.

60
00:04:28,621 --> 00:04:31,488
What? How about a toasting fork,
like everyone else?

61
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:34,621
We'll be broke. Go and fill
the bottom of a chest with sand.

62
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:38,648
We follow that money,
we find the Pact.

63
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:42,447
Look, trust me! I have a plan.

64
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:51,243
Robin's favourite. Leads from outside
straight into the castle.

65
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:53,892
A simple iron grill in there
would fix that.

66
00:04:55,441 --> 00:04:59,525
Mmmm... Bars on there.

67
00:04:59,521 --> 00:05:01,887
Upgrade this young man to leather.

68
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:05,362
He's a hero.
HE CHUCKLES

69
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:07,682
An idea as good
as emptying the strongroom.

70
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:12,805
What're you doing?
I'm doing nothing.

71
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:14,689
Giving away
all Robin's secrets!

72
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,707
You advised the Sheriff
about the strongroom.

73
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:20,932
Look, I'm fighting for my life
here, Marian. Yes, you are.

74
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:25,927
Stop now,
or I swear I will kill you.

75
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:34,045
Something wrong?
No. No. Just... meeting the locals.

76
00:05:35,481 --> 00:05:36,766
In.

77
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:41,845
John of York, my dear son!

78
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,288
How wonderful to see you. How
much are you paying me this week?

79
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:46,327
The lot.

80
00:05:47,661 --> 00:05:50,664
My porters have the money
to pay the bond.

81
00:05:50,661 --> 00:05:53,346
I'm here to claim my bride.

82
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:56,868
Oh, g-good!
The Sheriff will be... delighted.

83
00:05:56,861 --> 00:05:59,785
Have your men give it to the guards.

84
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:03,308
You wait through there and I'll
give the Sheriff the good news.

85
00:06:10,201 --> 00:06:13,921
I hope you know what
you're doing, Robin. Trust me, John.

86
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:34,641
My Lord.

87
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:35,710
What?

88
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:37,248
We have a problem.

89
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:38,321
Please.

90
00:06:40,961 --> 00:06:43,646
I'm not being funny,
but it doesn't look like a problem.

91
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:45,529
It's the repayment of a loan.

92
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:51,643
What's the problem?
It's the bond on the girl, Beatrice.
York is waiting outside. York?

93
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:53,211
It's too late.

94
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:54,930
We've agreed to sell her to Durham.

95
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:58,129
Anyway... You said he had nothing.
Where did he get this money?

96
00:06:58,121 --> 00:07:01,409
My Lord, I couldn't say,
but it's all there, everything.

97
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:07,124
What do I tell him? You use your
initiative, hmm? Tell him it was
an act of God.

98
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:20,383
John! Beatrice!

99
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:23,603
What are you doing here?

100
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:27,241
I'm here to save you. I've paid off
the bond, and we're to be together.

101
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:28,788
Come round!

102
00:07:32,881 --> 00:07:35,861
Take her.
What are they doing? What's going on?

103
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:37,726
You leave her alone! John!

104
00:07:37,721 --> 00:07:40,201
Beatrice!
The money. It's not all there.

105
00:07:40,201 --> 00:07:42,726
It is there! Every penny.
Capital and interest.

106
00:07:42,721 --> 00:07:44,609
Not the early redemption charges.

107
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:47,490
The early... what?
It's another five hundred.

108
00:07:47,481 --> 00:07:49,483
Five hundred?

109
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:54,692
I'll marry her without the bond. Do
you not understand how debt works?

110
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:57,969
While I have the bond,
she is church property.

111
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:07,610
I know where he got this from.

112
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:11,082
These boxes belong to Robin. How
do you know? Well, cos I nicked...

113
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:14,801
Cos I know. Why would Robin Hood
give money to a knight?

114
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:19,261
Well, he wouldn't. Unless... he
thought he could get it back.

115
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:25,241
Well... Let's disappoint him,
shall we?

116
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:28,586
We're going to put it
in your little birdcage.

117
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:30,651
It's time for the unveiling.

118
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:33,907
My Lord, this cage. Is it wise?

119
00:08:33,901 --> 00:08:35,823
It's your man's idea. It's genius.

120
00:08:35,821 --> 00:08:37,846
All that money where everyone can
see it?

121
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:40,028
And Robin Hood's going to steal it.

122
00:08:57,581 --> 00:08:59,344
(Where are they going?

123
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:01,343
(Instead of left, they've gone right!

124
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,184
(Right leads back outside!)

125
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:04,546
Robin...

126
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,623
BUZZ OF CONVERSATION

127
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:13,106
This is not good. It should lead
us to the Pact.

128
00:09:13,101 --> 00:09:14,625
We're back where we started!

129
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,623
Shhh!

130
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:18,145
And what's that?

131
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,381
FANFARE

132
00:09:23,181 --> 00:09:28,141
People... My dear people,

133
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:30,746
we are gathered here today

134
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:34,871
to witness the unveiling
of my marvellous birdcage.

135
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:36,283
CROWD GASPS

136
00:09:36,281 --> 00:09:38,681
Ah, ha, ha, ha!

137
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:41,343
What're you doing?
We're trying to find the Pact.

138
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:44,287
Nottingham's exchequer,

139
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:47,307
our community chest.

140
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:55,310
There for all to see,
demonstrating once again my
commitment to open government, hmm?

141
00:09:55,301 --> 00:09:57,690
CROWD MURMURS

142
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:03,449
And this,
this latest addition to our fund,

143
00:10:03,441 --> 00:10:10,722
I have been reliably informed,
has come from the coffers
of Robin Hood himself.

144
00:10:10,721 --> 00:10:16,512
CROWD GASPS
There goes our money. Archers all
around. Clever.

145
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:21,643
If you happen to see Robin Hood
and he asks you,
"Have you seen my money?",

146
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:27,967
you can say to him, "The answer my
friend, is blowing in the wind!"
PEOPLE LAUGH

147
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,088
It was Allan's idea.

148
00:10:30,081 --> 00:10:35,405
He's informed the Sheriff of all
the ways in and out of the castle.

149
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,541
A good scheme, Allan.
They're sealing off the exits.

150
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,145
You have to get out now.

151
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:44,384
But what if Allan tells him about
you? He won't. I've silenced him.

152
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,987
STOP!
CROWD: Oh!

153
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:54,085
That's my money! What's that man
doing?

154
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:56,447
I want my bride! Is he mad?

155
00:10:56,441 --> 00:11:00,844
Yes, he's in love. I've settled
her debts and you've got your money.

156
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:05,547
You're the thieves,
you and the Canon.

157
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:10,444
WOMAN SCREAMS
Not Robin Hood.
CROWD LAUGHS

158
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:12,363
Guards! Hang him.

159
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:13,965
What?

160
00:11:18,441 --> 00:11:20,409
Come on, John.

161
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:25,031
Much, grab a corner! John!

162
00:11:26,841 --> 00:11:28,365
Jump!

163
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:32,428
John!

164
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:38,608
Now! Ohh! Uhh!
PEOPLE SCREAM

165
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:42,321
NOW! Come on!

166
00:11:42,321 --> 00:11:44,004
Run! Move!

167
00:11:45,241 --> 00:11:46,242
John!

168
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:48,470
John?

169
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:49,962
Come on!

170
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:06,211
We've lost all our money.

171
00:12:06,201 --> 00:12:08,021
And we don't have the Pact.

172
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:10,649
What were you playing at?
We could've been killed!

173
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:12,609
Did you tell him it was our money?
No!

174
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:14,410
The Canon said it wasn't enough.

175
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,881
He says I have
to pay early redemption charges.

176
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:22,145
You know what? We need to have
a little chat with this Canon.

177
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,850
I hear he takes confession from
the tavern girls every lunchtime.

178
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:33,112
They got away. Surprise, mm? Not.

179
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:37,231
Hood always gets away, and I'm
getting rather TIRED OF IT!

180
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:40,952
This time...

181
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:42,704
WE go to HIM.

182
00:12:44,841 --> 00:12:48,129
Look, like I said to Giz, I...

183
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:50,362
I can't tell you where Robin lives.

184
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:56,469
Whose side are you on, Allan?

185
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:01,727
Even if I did tell you, he might've
moved on. We'll find out, won't we?

186
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:03,370
I want him dead.

187
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:09,212
Yeah, but if he hasn't moved on,
he'll set traps up.
It'd be too dangerous.

188
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:11,123
Yes, well...

189
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:14,204
Don't you worry about that, eh,
dear boy?

190
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:16,691
We'll send you in first.

191
00:13:34,741 --> 00:13:37,244
(Marian... Father...
Shh-shh!

192
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,647
(Father, Robin is in trouble.

193
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:43,802
(Allan is leading Gisborne
to the camp.

194
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:48,704
(I need to find a way to get out
of the castle and warn him, but
the Sheriff has blocked every exit.

195
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:53,183
(I don't know what to do.) Do you
want to end up in a cell like me?

196
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:58,721
No, but I must warn Robin.
Is he worthy of all these
risks you take for him? Yes!

197
00:13:58,721 --> 00:14:00,461
He can't change anything.

198
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:02,190
Yes, he can.

199
00:14:02,181 --> 00:14:05,765
He's going to show the traitors'
Pact to the King.

200
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,150
The Sheriff's days are numbered.

201
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:09,904
And does Robin know where it is?

202
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:12,051
This Pact? No.

203
00:14:13,701 --> 00:14:15,749
But he'll find it.

204
00:14:15,741 --> 00:14:17,823
The pair of you...

205
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:22,861
You're dreamers. Dreamers?! Because
we are not weak like you?

206
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:25,512
How dare you? You caused all this!

207
00:14:25,501 --> 00:14:30,188
You allowed the Sheriff to take
your job. You stood there and did
nothing. That is not true.

208
00:14:30,181 --> 00:14:31,512
And you condemn Robin...

209
00:14:33,141 --> 00:14:35,792
You should be helping us.

210
00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:37,829
I don't have time for this.

211
00:14:37,821 --> 00:14:39,527
Marian...

212
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,509
I'm ashamed of you sometimes.

213
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:52,324
Marian...

214
00:14:54,901 --> 00:14:57,301
DOOR CLANGS SHUT

215
00:14:57,301 --> 00:14:59,963
FOOTSTEPS ECHO

216
00:15:06,341 --> 00:15:08,104
MUTED CONVERSATION

217
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:16,423
COIN JINGLES

218
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:19,221
What do you want?

219
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:21,269
I'm here to take confession.
Very good.

220
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,383
Yours!

221
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:28,669
I've paid off Beatrice's bond.
Where is it?

222
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,630
I don't have it. Is it in
the birdcage? It's not, is it?

223
00:15:31,621 --> 00:15:35,182
It's too exposed up there for
papers. Well, how would I know?

224
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:39,902
You don't understand.
You see, it's not just my friend
here who needs to know.

225
00:15:39,901 --> 00:15:45,066
Well, as God is my friend,
I swear I don't know where they are.
And I swear to you,

226
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:48,064
that if you don't tell us,

227
00:15:48,061 --> 00:15:50,302
God won't be your friend,

228
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:52,189
he'll be your next-door neighbour.

229
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:53,227
Whoa! Wh...!

230
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:58,186
If you promise not to hurt me,
I will tell you the truth.

231
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:01,831
I promise.

232
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:06,747
Listen, I have no idea where
the Sheriff keeps his papers,
but it doesn't matter.

233
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:10,711
Somebody else has already
repaid the bond. What? Who?

234
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:14,262
The Earl of Durham. He will marry
Beatrice on Saturday.

235
00:16:14,261 --> 00:16:16,149
The Sheriff's made a deal.

236
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,530
She would never marry
another man. She loves me.

237
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:22,230
That's why we haven't told her.
That is immoral! Oh, grow up!

238
00:16:22,221 --> 00:16:28,171
Money has a way of making things
moral, and Durham is paying more
than you could ever dream of.

239
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:30,425
After all, she's a very pretty girl.

240
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:32,207
Uh-uh!

241
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:35,625
You made a promise before God
not to hurt me.

242
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,509
HE did...

243
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:43,242
CLATTERING
Aagh!

244
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:46,170
PEOPLE CRY OUT

245
00:16:47,641 --> 00:16:49,689
...I didn't. Thank you.

246
00:16:51,481 --> 00:16:53,210
Gisborne's men, get on the back!

247
00:16:53,201 --> 00:16:56,364
We're going to Hood's camp!
Come on, get on there... Get up!

248
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:59,865
Guy, I need a favour.
No. I must get to a physician.

249
00:16:59,861 --> 00:17:02,728
My father is getting worse.
Marian...

250
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,531
You know the rules
governing your house arrest.

251
00:17:05,521 --> 00:17:08,365
But I would be with you and
I would come straight back.

252
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:12,070
Please...
Piece of gold for the head of Hood!

253
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:17,210
Get yourselves together.
We've work to do.

254
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:20,329
Why? The Sheriff is selling Beatrice
to the Earl of Durham.

255
00:17:20,321 --> 00:17:22,061
We have to get her out. How?

256
00:17:22,061 --> 00:17:23,961
Allan's blocked all our ways in.

257
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:27,624
Oh... Don't worry,
we'll think of something. Come on.

258
00:17:32,521 --> 00:17:34,341
I am truly beholden to you all.

259
00:17:35,461 --> 00:17:36,530
It's what we do.

260
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:40,571
You have no idea what she
means to me. Let me guess...

261
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:43,007
You can't sleep for thinking of her.

262
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:47,010
You can't turn a corner
without hoping she'll be there.

263
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:50,926
You have those feelings?
I'm just guessing.

264
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:02,689
Thank you.

265
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:05,366
Once again I am in your debt.

266
00:18:05,361 --> 00:18:08,728
I'm not comfortable with the
Sheriff's treatment of your father.

267
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:09,961
Or you.

268
00:18:11,921 --> 00:18:14,082
Do you need me to wait
at the physician's?

269
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:16,788
No, don't let me keep you.

270
00:18:16,781 --> 00:18:18,362
Go straight back.

271
00:18:27,921 --> 00:18:29,491
HORSE WHINNIES

272
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:39,524
HORSE WHINNIES

273
00:19:07,661 --> 00:19:08,730
Come on.

274
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:11,810
ROBIN!

275
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:13,325
Yes, my love?

276
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:16,722
Get me down! You're in danger!
But you look so good up there!

277
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:18,962
You will pay, Robin of Locksley.

278
00:19:18,961 --> 00:19:21,850
Honestly! You look gorgeous
from any angle.

279
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,121
ALL: Ooh!

280
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,487
How do I look from that angle?

281
00:19:26,481 --> 00:19:29,644
Listen to me, I was wrong.
Allan is out of control.

282
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:33,168
He's leading Gisborne and his men
here, now! Allan?

283
00:19:38,361 --> 00:19:39,862
You should stay here with us.

284
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:43,365
I cannot live in the forest.
Why not?

285
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:49,448
Well... Because green doesn't
suit me? It's your father, isn't it?

286
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:53,923
I cannot turn my back on him.
And I cannot be found here.

287
00:19:55,721 --> 00:19:58,531
What I said before... What?

288
00:19:58,521 --> 00:19:59,681
You know...

289
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:02,448
I said you were gorgeous.

290
00:20:04,881 --> 00:20:06,644
I meant it.

291
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:10,184
HORSE SNORTS

292
00:20:10,181 --> 00:20:12,684
And I meant what I said.

293
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:17,425
One day you will pay,
Robin of Locksley.

294
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:27,429
HORSE WHINNIES

295
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:30,102
"Just guessing"?

296
00:20:30,101 --> 00:20:31,682
Liar!

297
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:36,441
We've closed up the camp.

298
00:20:38,101 --> 00:20:40,865
Let's meet Gisborne and Allan
on the lower road.

299
00:20:40,861 --> 00:20:42,749
Give Allan the welcome he deserves.

300
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,562
This is war. Now come on...

301
00:20:57,061 --> 00:20:58,483
HORSES WHINNY

302
00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:13,382
Well, as the Sheriff said...

303
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:15,087
you take the lead.

304
00:21:17,065 --> 00:21:18,669
Well, we're not there yet.

305
00:21:20,348 --> 00:21:21,770
All right...

306
00:21:22,911 --> 00:21:24,833
Guards, wait there.

307
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:02,926
I told you to hang back!

308
00:22:08,957 --> 00:22:10,367
Hood!

309
00:22:10,357 --> 00:22:13,178
I thought you said we weren't near!
We're not!

310
00:22:13,177 --> 00:22:14,678
He knew we were coming.

311
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:20,703
HORSE NEIGHS

312
00:22:20,697 --> 00:22:22,198
It's Robin!

313
00:22:23,637 --> 00:22:24,638
HE GASPS

314
00:22:25,717 --> 00:22:26,843
GALLOPING HOOVES

315
00:22:35,997 --> 00:22:39,364
Guy! GUY! Get on!

316
00:22:44,117 --> 00:22:45,641
They got away.

317
00:22:45,637 --> 00:22:47,446
Gisborne knows someone warned us.

318
00:22:47,437 --> 00:22:49,507
He'll squeeze Allan
to find out who.

319
00:22:49,497 --> 00:22:52,045
Allan would not betray Marian.

320
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,665
Yes, he would.
Allan is not betraying anyone.

321
00:22:54,657 --> 00:22:57,205
We're going to see to that.

322
00:23:06,577 --> 00:23:08,465
Open up. Injured men 'ere.

323
00:23:08,457 --> 00:23:10,823
Gisborne said you were all dead.

324
00:23:10,817 --> 00:23:13,206
Do we look dead? Open up!

325
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:19,877
HORSE WHINNIES

326
00:23:31,097 --> 00:23:34,077
Go to the tower,
find the girl, get her out.

327
00:23:35,057 --> 00:23:38,618
And you? I'm going to find Allan.

328
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:42,940
Robin... Don't...

329
00:23:42,937 --> 00:23:44,017
Djaq...

330
00:23:46,297 --> 00:23:49,937
I know you
liked him, but he HAS to be stopped.

331
00:23:49,937 --> 00:23:51,541
For all our sakes.

332
00:23:54,777 --> 00:23:56,017
Good luck.

333
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,086
Ready?

334
00:24:03,057 --> 00:24:04,501
WHISTLE

335
00:24:09,177 --> 00:24:10,257
Robin!

336
00:24:10,257 --> 00:24:13,579
Expecting to find your
new friend Gisborne, Allan?

337
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:17,999
I don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

338
00:24:17,997 --> 00:24:20,500
I had no choice.

339
00:24:20,497 --> 00:24:23,182
I would never take him to the camp.

340
00:24:23,177 --> 00:24:27,102
I wouldn't. I love you, Robin,
all of you. That's very touching.

341
00:24:28,937 --> 00:24:33,226
But as they say... Love hurts.

342
00:24:40,817 --> 00:24:41,943
Don't do it, Robin!

343
00:24:57,137 --> 00:24:59,219
Let's just talk about this. Yeah.

344
00:24:59,217 --> 00:25:03,540
Let's talk. And you can start by
telling me where the Sheriff
keeps his documents.

345
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:06,404
I don't know! I just told him
to empty his strongroom.

346
00:25:06,397 --> 00:25:09,787
You must know where he's
moved the Pact. I swear I don't.

347
00:25:11,497 --> 00:25:14,477
Maybe his room, there's a safe
in there. Trust me, Robin.

348
00:25:14,477 --> 00:25:16,866
Trust you?! No, I don't think so.

349
00:25:21,637 --> 00:25:23,741
I've told you I'd never betray you!

350
00:25:23,737 --> 00:25:26,661
You already have.
And next you'll betray Marian.

351
00:25:29,477 --> 00:25:32,139
I am not a Judas. And I'm not Jesus.

352
00:25:36,837 --> 00:25:40,421
Marian? What happened to you?

353
00:25:42,017 --> 00:25:44,497
An incident in the woods.
It was nothing.

354
00:25:45,257 --> 00:25:47,043
THEY GROAN

355
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:58,062
How is Sir Edward? I wasjust on
my way to see him, actually.

356
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,901
I'll tell him you asked after him.
That's kind.

357
00:26:03,817 --> 00:26:04,863
Marian...

358
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:10,540
There is another side to me... Guy.

359
00:26:12,657 --> 00:26:16,900
My father. I should like
to visit him alone.

360
00:26:18,357 --> 00:26:19,984
Of course.

361
00:26:32,977 --> 00:26:34,183
Now...

362
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:35,257
Please.

363
00:26:36,577 --> 00:26:38,158
I don't want to die.

364
00:26:38,157 --> 00:26:40,899
Well, that's the only way
you're going to escape me.

365
00:26:40,897 --> 00:26:42,125
Robin, spare him!

366
00:26:43,657 --> 00:26:44,999
I can't.

367
00:26:44,997 --> 00:26:46,919
Please. Do it for me.

368
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:48,600
Marian, I'm doing this for you.

369
00:26:48,597 --> 00:26:49,803
To protect you.

370
00:26:49,797 --> 00:26:53,881
Robin! Robin, please.
If you love me, you will let him go.

371
00:26:53,877 --> 00:26:55,640
I do love you.

372
00:26:55,637 --> 00:26:57,525
And that's why I can't let him live.

373
00:26:57,517 --> 00:27:01,078
Because one day he'd do something
that would take you away from me.

374
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:03,125
I wouldn't.

375
00:27:03,117 --> 00:27:06,905
Please,
don't taint us with his blood.

376
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:25,386
You owe me your life.
Don't you EVER betray me!

377
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,402
I won't.

378
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,599
It took you a long time
to tell me that.

379
00:27:42,597 --> 00:27:45,179
Tell you what?

380
00:27:45,177 --> 00:27:47,179
You know.

381
00:27:51,617 --> 00:27:53,983
I must have been half concussed.

382
00:27:55,177 --> 00:27:58,078
Well, you'll be fully concussed
if you don't watch out.

383
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:03,065
I think I know where the Pact is.

384
00:28:11,297 --> 00:28:16,018
Yes? We're here to escort the
prisoner to the Earl of Durham.

385
00:28:19,217 --> 00:28:22,027
Come along, my dear.
Your future husband's waiting.

386
00:28:32,817 --> 00:28:33,920
Father?

387
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:38,179
Father, I've brought you some food.

388
00:28:44,697 --> 00:28:47,097
I'm sorry about what I said.

389
00:29:10,237 --> 00:29:13,138
SNORING

390
00:29:36,137 --> 00:29:38,822
DOOR CREAKS

391
00:30:58,877 --> 00:30:59,946
The Pact.

392
00:31:13,317 --> 00:31:15,547
THEY MOUTH

393
00:31:18,397 --> 00:31:20,865
(I knew it would be here.)
HE MOUTHS

394
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:27,939
HE SNORTS

395
00:31:35,357 --> 00:31:36,358
My keys...

396
00:31:38,477 --> 00:31:40,547
My keys... GUARDS! GUARDS!

397
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,882
(My keys! My keys were here.)

398
00:31:44,437 --> 00:31:46,064
Why...?

399
00:31:54,157 --> 00:31:55,738
Shhh.

400
00:32:07,277 --> 00:32:11,839
So... what do we have here, huh?

401
00:32:11,837 --> 00:32:15,238
My old friend...

402
00:32:15,237 --> 00:32:16,647
Hoody Two Shoes.

403
00:32:17,397 --> 00:32:19,285
Looking for me, Sheriff? GUARDS!

404
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:23,200
AFTER HIM!

405
00:32:23,197 --> 00:32:24,744
GET AFTER HIM!

406
00:32:33,397 --> 00:32:34,477
Edward!

407
00:32:34,477 --> 00:32:41,485
Robin! You escaped the dungeons?
I heard England needed saving.
I have the Pact. Come on, come on.

408
00:32:41,477 --> 00:32:43,206
This way.

409
00:32:43,197 --> 00:32:44,721
Hood's in the castle!

410
00:32:44,717 --> 00:32:48,926
Seal all exits!
Check all the corridors for Hood!

411
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:50,726
Much. Hah!

412
00:32:50,717 --> 00:32:52,287
Well met, my friends.

413
00:32:52,277 --> 00:32:53,938
A new member of the gang.

414
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:56,679
THEY CHATTER

415
00:33:03,397 --> 00:33:05,638
Yes! The portcullis is open!

416
00:33:07,937 --> 00:33:11,282
All soldiers,
assemble to the main gate!

417
00:33:11,277 --> 00:33:13,120
We're going into emergency lockdown!

418
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:15,017
Master, what do we do? Keep going.

419
00:33:15,017 --> 00:33:17,963
No-one goes in or out of the castle.
Halt!

420
00:33:24,637 --> 00:33:27,424
Lads, let us through. Nobody leaves.

421
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:29,783
We're going into lockdown.

422
00:33:29,777 --> 00:33:33,759
We're escorting the
prisoner to the Earl of Durham.

423
00:33:43,097 --> 00:33:44,200
Thank you.

424
00:33:44,937 --> 00:33:48,941
Stop him! Stop him! That's Hood!

425
00:33:48,937 --> 00:33:50,279
Nice try.

426
00:33:50,277 --> 00:33:52,427
Sorry to rain on your parade, Hood.

427
00:33:52,417 --> 00:33:54,385
That's all right!

428
00:33:54,377 --> 00:33:56,322
Every cloud...

429
00:34:05,837 --> 00:34:07,122
...has a silver lining.

430
00:34:09,577 --> 00:34:11,067
Pay day, boys!
SHOUTING

431
00:34:11,057 --> 00:34:12,388
Come on, let's go!

432
00:34:12,377 --> 00:34:16,507
SHOUTING CONTINUES

433
00:34:18,817 --> 00:34:24,426
Split up! You know where to meet.
And ditch those uniforms. Off!

434
00:34:28,457 --> 00:34:29,879
He's getting away!

435
00:34:45,697 --> 00:34:47,801
Is everyone all right?

436
00:34:50,177 --> 00:34:51,280
Good.

437
00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:54,287
And where'd you think you're going?

438
00:34:54,277 --> 00:34:55,505
Birkley.

439
00:34:57,617 --> 00:35:00,643
That girl stays here.
She belongs to the Earl of Durham.

440
00:35:00,637 --> 00:35:02,423
No, she belongs with me.

441
00:35:04,617 --> 00:35:08,587
Hand her over,
or say goodbye to your friend.
Don't listen to him.

442
00:35:10,057 --> 00:35:11,285
Robin! Go!

443
00:35:12,817 --> 00:35:15,706
That's a mistake, old man.
I will KILL you!

444
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:16,777
Leave it, Birkley!

445
00:35:18,017 --> 00:35:20,281
You're a man of God.
You cannot kill.

446
00:35:21,377 --> 00:35:24,619
And you, Hood, are a man of war
who cannot kill!

447
00:35:28,457 --> 00:35:29,617
Try me.

448
00:35:38,057 --> 00:35:45,463
Edward! NO! Get him down!

449
00:35:45,457 --> 00:35:49,200
Don't remove the knife.
I'll prepare my instruments.

450
00:35:49,197 --> 00:35:51,506
John, get John and Beatrice
to safety, NOW!

451
00:35:51,497 --> 00:35:53,203
This way. GO!

452
00:35:53,757 --> 00:35:59,059
Robin, leave me. I will not, sir.
I will slow you down.

453
00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:01,457
QUIETLY: Go on, go on.

454
00:36:08,717 --> 00:36:13,302
I've never quite understood
my daughter's feelings for you.

455
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:15,265
Well, I probably don't deserve them.

456
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:18,624
No, I think maybe you do.

457
00:36:22,777 --> 00:36:26,668
You'd better take this... Pact.

458
00:36:26,657 --> 00:36:30,104
You will NOT give up your life
for mine.

459
00:36:30,097 --> 00:36:32,748
For England.

460
00:36:34,237 --> 00:36:36,057
Robin, listen to me.

461
00:36:37,777 --> 00:36:41,781
For Marian to lose both of us
would kill her. Edward, Edward...

462
00:36:41,777 --> 00:36:43,938
That is not going to happen.

463
00:36:43,937 --> 00:36:49,261
Give her a message from me.
Tell her... Tell her...

464
00:36:51,337 --> 00:36:53,578
...it's good to dream.

465
00:36:53,577 --> 00:36:54,839
I will.

466
00:37:16,097 --> 00:37:17,382
Who's there?

467
00:37:33,077 --> 00:37:34,863
Edward.

468
00:37:43,377 --> 00:37:44,503
GUARDS!

469
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:03,465
Father... Father?

470
00:38:05,557 --> 00:38:06,922
Father, wake up!

471
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:10,921
Wake up, please, wake up... please...

472
00:38:10,917 --> 00:38:15,866
Father... Father...

473
00:38:15,857 --> 00:38:17,518
WHAT HAPPENED?

474
00:38:17,517 --> 00:38:20,281
What happened? Tell me
what happened! Tell me!

475
00:38:20,277 --> 00:38:22,427
There were no witnesses, Marian.

476
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:26,478
The Sheriff
thinks that he was helping Hood
steal an important document. No!

477
00:38:26,477 --> 00:38:28,718
No, he wasn't! No...!

478
00:38:28,717 --> 00:38:30,537
No...

479
00:38:35,617 --> 00:38:36,902
Sorry...

480
00:38:37,977 --> 00:38:44,940
Marian... I'm so sorry!
Father, I'm sorry!

481
00:38:46,777 --> 00:38:51,385
Marian... Will you just...
leave me alone?

482
00:39:00,697 --> 00:39:05,100
Marian, come on...
Don't you touch me! Don't touch me!

483
00:39:08,757 --> 00:39:12,557
Stop. Wait.

484
00:39:12,557 --> 00:39:14,559
Listen to me.

485
00:39:14,557 --> 00:39:17,583
This place may not be safe
for you now. Why?

486
00:39:19,437 --> 00:39:21,007
This is yours, I believe?

487
00:39:20,997 --> 00:39:23,886
Your father's jailer was
killed with it. I don't care!

488
00:39:23,877 --> 00:39:26,766
The Sheriff WILL care.

489
00:39:26,757 --> 00:39:31,399
And when he finds out that it was
your dagger that killed his jailer,

490
00:39:31,397 --> 00:39:32,898
he will hang you.

491
00:39:34,597 --> 00:39:36,918
No...

492
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,487
Let me look after you.

493
00:39:40,977 --> 00:39:42,342
Protect you.

494
00:39:44,797 --> 00:39:47,197
I've always cared about you, Marian.

495
00:39:50,477 --> 00:39:54,800
My feelings for you... I thought
they'd gone away.

496
00:39:56,957 --> 00:40:01,860
But they haven't. They're stronger
than ever.

497
00:40:08,877 --> 00:40:10,344
No! No!

498
00:40:11,897 --> 00:40:15,264
Forgive me. That was inappropriate.

499
00:40:16,937 --> 00:40:18,541
But in time...

500
00:40:21,497 --> 00:40:23,067
DOOR SLAMS

501
00:40:31,377 --> 00:40:33,265
I was with him when he died.

502
00:40:36,877 --> 00:40:38,947
I'm sorry.

503
00:40:43,797 --> 00:40:45,503
Shhh...

504
00:40:56,817 --> 00:41:00,878
It's my fault.
I told him he was weak.

505
00:41:00,877 --> 00:41:02,981
He died a hero's death. Don't...

506
00:41:02,977 --> 00:41:05,980
He got the Pact.

507
00:41:05,977 --> 00:41:10,459
For England. He died believing
he had a wilful daughter. No.

508
00:41:13,097 --> 00:41:16,362
He asked me to give you a message...

509
00:41:16,357 --> 00:41:19,383
"It's good to dream."

510
00:41:28,677 --> 00:41:30,338
Come with me to the forest.

511
00:41:33,337 --> 00:41:34,827
I have a horse waiting.

512
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,100
Come on.

513
00:42:19,957 --> 00:42:22,562
Do you, John of York,

514
00:42:22,557 --> 00:42:26,846
promise to protect and honour
this woman as long as you
both shall live? I do.

515
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:31,683
Then I,
as the rightful Lord of Locksley
in the county of Nottingham,

516
00:42:31,677 --> 00:42:35,238
now pronounce you man and wife.

517
00:42:35,237 --> 00:42:37,808
You may kiss the bride.

518
00:42:37,797 --> 00:42:40,163
CHEERS

519
00:42:51,437 --> 00:42:52,961
Thank you.

520
00:42:55,637 --> 00:42:59,186
Toasting fork. Thank you!

521
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:08,478
Good luck!

522
00:43:08,477 --> 00:43:11,526
You did disarm the trap,
didn't you, Will...?

523
00:43:18,777 --> 00:43:20,404
You know what you're going to do?

524
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:23,639
Retrieve the Great Pact of
