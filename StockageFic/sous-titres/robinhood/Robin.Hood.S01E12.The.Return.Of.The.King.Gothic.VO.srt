1
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:11,960
Ah. Gisborne.
Hold a bird. Come on.

2
00:00:13,384 --> 00:00:16,983
Here, come on. Give him some love. Hm?

3
00:00:17,068 --> 00:00:19,539
Poor thing.

4
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,069
It is poetry, though, isn't it?

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,042
Caged bird, a creature 
that would fly free,

6
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:29,310
absolutely under my control.

7
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:33,064
It's good, I like it.

8
00:00:33,065 --> 00:00:37,010
Now, talking of caged prettiness...

9
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:39,478
when are you marrying Marian?

10
00:00:40,098 --> 00:00:44,161
- In due course.
- Oh, come along, don't be coy.

11
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,974
- That's not the arrangement, is it?
- No.

12
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:49,905
- We will marry when the King returns.
- Ah.

13
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:54,616
When the King comes.
I might have news for you there.

14
00:00:56,084 --> 00:00:57,689
- What news?
- Do you know,

15
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,269
sometimes I don't feed them
for, ooh, three days.

16
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,244
Cruel, perhaps, but I find it
makes them sing better.

17
00:01:03,245 --> 00:01:05,743
What news?

18
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:09,007
Oh, Gisborne.

19
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:12,881
I hate the cave.

20
00:01:12,882 --> 00:01:15,761
It's gonna rain again
and it's dry in there.

21
00:01:15,786 --> 00:01:19,360
It's dark and it's, you know, horrible.

22
00:01:19,674 --> 00:01:21,878
We voted, Much.

23
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:23,925
And you lost, five-one.

24
00:01:24,577 --> 00:01:26,108
Yeah, well...

25
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:28,675
I should have two votes,
because I really don't like the cave.

26
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:30,144
In fact, I should have three,

27
00:01:30,145 --> 00:01:31,996
because I really, really
don't like the cave.

28
00:01:39,463 --> 00:01:43,221
Bats! I hate... bats!

29
00:01:43,307 --> 00:01:46,427
Bats are rats, rats with wings.

30
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,830
No, they are intelligent.

31
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:50,549
Bats make noises you cannot hear.

32
00:01:50,597 --> 00:01:52,946
What's the point of that?
Noises you can't hear?

33
00:01:53,036 --> 00:01:55,271
What if there was a noise
nobody could hear?

34
00:01:55,272 --> 00:01:58,118
And then if you were the only person
who could hear it.

35
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:00,358
Because I am that person.

36
00:02:00,443 --> 00:02:03,418
To see sense where others see no sense.

37
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:05,650
Just like the bat.

38
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:07,513
I take it back.

39
00:02:07,514 --> 00:02:09,768
I like the bat.

40
00:02:10,823 --> 00:02:14,531
The bat is my friend.
The bat understands me.

41
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:20,461
What took you so long?

42
00:02:21,252 --> 00:02:22,860
Well done!

43
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,382
Bread, good.

44
00:02:29,726 --> 00:02:30,779
All right!

45
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:35,732
Well?

46
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:40,095
What's the matter?

47
00:02:43,714 --> 00:02:44,836
The King is coming.

48
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:50,021
Resynced and adapted by
ScarHand

49
00:02:51,108 --> 00:02:53,249
For the SubWood Team

50
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:27,219
Richard? To England?

51
00:03:27,303 --> 00:03:29,296
Yeah, that'll be right!

52
00:03:29,385 --> 00:03:31,981
It's not a rumor, John.

53
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:36,469
I spoke to Thornton. He heard Gisborne talking.

54
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:38,863
- To England?
- To Nottingham.

55
00:03:38,954 --> 00:03:41,994
They're saying he's landed at Hull,
he's gonna come here on his way to London.

56
00:03:42,077 --> 00:03:44,468
The King? To Nottingham?

57
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:46,711
Oh, this is good, isn't it?

58
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:48,554
- The King?
- Yes.

59
00:03:49,524 --> 00:03:53,236
Oh, this is a good day.
After all, we have bread and the King is coming.

60
00:03:53,327 --> 00:03:55,524
- Will you just shut up?
- No!

61
00:03:55,609 --> 00:04:00,004
This is what we've been waiting for.
The Sheriff will be ousted, and Gisborne.

62
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:02,290
Then Robin can go home, I can go home,
Little John...

63
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,238
Little John's an outlaw.

64
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,993
- We all are.
- Robin will pardon you.

65
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:08,771
- Obviously.
- Will?

66
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:10,740
Oh, this is great, isn't it?

67
00:04:10,823 --> 00:04:13,738
Well, we should have a feast! This is wonderful!

68
00:04:13,826 --> 00:04:15,500
Shut up!

69
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:18,628
- Will.
- Well, excuse me for being pleased

70
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,668
that all our prayers are answered.

71
00:04:23,355 --> 00:04:25,028
Tell me.

72
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:31,838
Come on, tell me.

73
00:04:33,164 --> 00:04:37,319
Gisborne is saying... Now the King's
coming back, Gisborne is saying...

74
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:39,320
Gisborne is saying 
he'll marry Marian.

75
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:43,811
Ah.

76
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,978
She'll never go through with it.

77
00:04:53,863 --> 00:04:55,775
Gisborne says the wedding's on Saturday.

78
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:04,872
Marian.

79
00:05:04,953 --> 00:05:06,627
Sir Edward.

80
00:05:10,838 --> 00:05:13,195
I bring good news.

81
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:15,353
There 's something I...

82
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:17,082
No.

83
00:05:17,164 --> 00:05:20,557
- Oh! What are you doing?
- What do you think you...?

84
00:05:25,051 --> 00:05:26,965
Sir Guy!

85
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:31,008
I apologize.

86
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,329
I just wanted to sweep 
you off your feet.

87
00:05:36,862 --> 00:05:39,425
- Will you come with me to Locksley?
- Why?

88
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,144
There 's something you should see.

89
00:05:50,595 --> 00:05:52,827
- Lady Marian.
- Thornton.

90
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,641
Come with me, there 's something
I want to show you.

91
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:04,120
I show you this.

92
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:11,449
- My wealth.
- Why?

93
00:06:12,695 --> 00:06:15,336
Er... I'm not sure what this means.

94
00:06:15,738 --> 00:06:17,696
This means everything.

95
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:21,899
This means that I am 
a man of substance.

96
00:06:23,065 --> 00:06:24,705
Wealth I can provide for you.

97
00:06:26,748 --> 00:06:28,706
I'm a man of power.

98
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,663
The Sheriff and I, increasingly with Ki...

99
00:06:31,753 --> 00:06:33,871
Prince John.

100
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:40,437
This means that I am a man of lineage.

101
00:06:43,323 --> 00:06:45,680
The Gisborne heritage is a proud one.

102
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:53,009
I will be glad to continue that line...

103
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,413
with you...

104
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:00,852
as my wife.

105
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:02,897
Something has changed.

106
00:07:06,505 --> 00:07:07,860
The King is returning.

107
00:07:37,973 --> 00:07:41,890
Mary! Thomas! Come on! Get on
with it, there 's work to be done.

108
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:44,009
Roll it.

109
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,057
Come on, help me with this barrel.

110
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:47,894
Put it over there.

111
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:52,710
Robin, I don't know what to say, I am sorry.

112
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:54,296
Tell me what you know.

113
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:59,424
Well, the King comes on Saturday, the wedding
takes place on Saturday here at Locksley.

114
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:02,906
Er, they're going to decorate the church.

115
00:08:02,997 --> 00:08:04,954
I need you to cast your mind back...

116
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,353
to my absence.

117
00:08:08,442 --> 00:08:11,038
Gisborne was unwell, or so he said.

118
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:14,358
The truth is, he went to the Holy Land
to try to kill the King.

119
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:21,132
Well, Robin, I'd love to say
that you were right

120
00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:23,855
but he was here.

121
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:26,407
- He was unwell.
- But no one was allowed to see him!

122
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:29,777
- Shh! A fever, a contagion.
- Conta...

123
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:33,282
But the physician came every day.

124
00:08:33,294 --> 00:08:35,863
I cooked the master' s meal every day.

125
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:37,784
The physician took it in to him.

126
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:39,862
- No.
- Who was this physician?

127
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,510
Erm...

128
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:45,552
- Pitts is his name.
- And where does this Pitts live?

129
00:08:45,636 --> 00:08:49,473
In Nottingham now, in Battley Street.

130
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,074
But... Robin...

131
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:53,199
This wedding cannot happen.

132
00:09:06,576 --> 00:09:09,267
I would prefer if you
did not visit my house

133
00:09:10,204 --> 00:09:11,442
until it is mine again.

134
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:14,653
Guy wanted to show me my future fortune
as Lady Gisborne.

135
00:09:17,385 --> 00:09:22,019
And what? He showed you some trinkets?
Made you agree to go along with the wedding?

136
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,934
You know I have no choice.

137
00:09:23,935 --> 00:09:25,484
I promised to marry
him when the King returned.

138
00:09:25,485 --> 00:09:28,023
- Under duress.
- Yes, under duress.

139
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:30,950
Proving my loyalty to save my life
and my father' s.

140
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,816
A promise made under duress
is no promise at all.

141
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:35,123
And what,

142
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:38,410
you think I should just back out
and Guy will smile and release me?

143
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:41,165
If he knew I betrayed him,
if he knew I was the Nightwatchman,

144
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,968
he would lash out, and not just at me.

145
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,724
At my father.

146
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:51,974
- Why do you always do this?
- What?

147
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:54,129
Use your father as an 
excuse for doing nothing?

148
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,860
- Because my father needs me.
- And you need him!

149
00:09:56,942 --> 00:09:59,174
Because without him,
you would have to make a choice.

150
00:09:59,263 --> 00:10:02,816
Oh, very well, then, I am making a choice.
I'm choosing to marry Gisborne.

151
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:06,501
Is that what you want me to say?

152
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:08,662
- I will deal with this.
- How?

153
00:10:10,314 --> 00:10:12,808
I will expose him as the liar
and the traitor that he is,

154
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:13,876
then you will not have to marry him.

155
00:10:13,877 --> 00:10:16,414
Robin, please do not make this
more difficult than it is.

156
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,757
- You do not love him!
- He has qualities!

157
00:10:18,842 --> 00:10:19,767
What qualities?

158
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:21,609
I believe his feelings for me are genuine,

159
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,196
- he has wealth and security...
- What do you mean, wealth?

160
00:10:25,288 --> 00:10:26,961
You're supposed to be the Nightwatchman.

161
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:30,681
You should steal from Gisborne and give
to the poor, not acquire wealth yourself!

162
00:10:30,773 --> 00:10:33,130
Do not tell me what 
I should be doing, please.

163
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,127
- Robin!
- Look at me.

164
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,970
Look at me.

165
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,492
- I will deal with this.
- Robin!

166
00:10:41,543 --> 00:10:43,979
Can't you see that you're upsetting Marian?

167
00:10:55,275 --> 00:10:58,075
I must leave for Merton. Will you be all right?

168
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,673
You have some scheme?

169
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,229
The Sheriff has a scheme.

170
00:11:02,776 --> 00:11:05,283
I think he intends to 
kill the King in Nottingham.

171
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,197
He cannot risk losing the shire.

172
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:13,892
I must act. Merton is loyal to me
and to the King. He will help.

173
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:15,930
And my marriage...

174
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,973
I must go through with it.

175
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:21,367
A man must...

176
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,098
protect his king.

177
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:26,300
A man must fight for his king.

178
00:11:27,593 --> 00:11:30,261
If could protect you and the King, I would.

179
00:11:30,348 --> 00:11:32,385
I know.

180
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:35,903
Anyway, I have a plan of my own.

181
00:11:35,993 --> 00:11:39,032
What? The Nightwatchman?

182
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:44,351
One final fling, something to make me feel
more comfortable in my marriage.

183
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:53,340
You are my world. You know that.

184
00:11:53,387 --> 00:11:57,646
I'm marrying a man I do not love.
There are worse things in heaven and earth.

185
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,687
And I am glad and proud...

186
00:12:04,619 --> 00:12:06,576
that you are my father.

187
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:10,854
My wonderful, honorable father.

188
00:12:40,412 --> 00:12:44,568
Battley Street.
Yeah. The physician's.

189
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,372
Master, all clear.

190
00:12:55,218 --> 00:12:58,782
- The physician's on his way.
- Let's see what Pitts has to say

191
00:12:58,783 --> 00:13:01,142
- about Gisborne's illness.
- Aye.

192
00:13:01,143 --> 00:13:05,711
I was thinking, we spend our lives skulking,
hiding in shadows.

193
00:13:05,753 --> 00:13:08,358
I've grown used to it. Be strange when it's over.

194
00:13:08,438 --> 00:13:11,990
- Hard to imagine.
- Well, soon it will be real.

195
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:14,999
If Gisborne is exposed, 
Robin will be restored,

196
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,039
and I will have my lodge, my Bonchurch.

197
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:19,805
Robin.

198
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,241
Allan, what will you do?

199
00:13:23,332 --> 00:13:25,244
Me?

200
00:13:25,753 --> 00:13:28,484
Well, live in my lodge.

201
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:31,092
Yeah, you know, servants and that.

202
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,132
- What about you?
- Carpentry, I suppose.

203
00:13:35,502 --> 00:13:37,176
- Wood.
- There 's Pitts.

204
00:14:07,852 --> 00:14:09,279
I have nothing of value.

205
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,072
- What was the trick?
- What trick?

206
00:14:11,073 --> 00:14:14,472
You are the physician who treated
Guy of Gisborne at Locksley a year ago?

207
00:14:14,473 --> 00:14:16,277
- You're Robin.
- What was the trick?

208
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:19,137
- There was no trick.
- I see.

209
00:14:19,702 --> 00:14:23,590
So tell me... what illness did he have?

210
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:26,715
Well, difficult to say. Fever, contagion,

211
00:14:26,716 --> 00:14:28,855
- the humors out of balance.
- Do not lie.

212
00:14:29,155 --> 00:14:30,729
My humors are out of balance.

213
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,343
He was very ill, he is lucky to be alive.

214
00:14:33,436 --> 00:14:37,672
I do not have time for this.
You tell me the truth.

215
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,392
You're a peace-lover, I have heard.

216
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:45,322
You will not harm me.

217
00:14:47,292 --> 00:14:51,281
You think you do Gisborne an innocent favor.
You do not.

218
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:55,257
This is a matter of treason.
Admit your part now,

219
00:14:55,258 --> 00:14:58,196
and when King Richard returns
I will speak for you.

220
00:15:00,186 --> 00:15:02,778
I established a quarantine.

221
00:15:02,863 --> 00:15:06,800
The servants prepared their master' s meals,
I took the meals in to him.

222
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:10,181
I sat there for an hour at a time,
ate the meals myself...

223
00:15:10,804 --> 00:15:13,108
brought out empty dishes.

224
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,669
You're a fool.

225
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,506
I meant no harm,
Sir Guy had business in London.

226
00:15:16,507 --> 00:15:19,202
He had business in the Holy Land.

227
00:15:19,203 --> 00:15:20,938
He tried to kill the King.

228
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:23,037
I had no idea.

229
00:15:23,568 --> 00:15:25,119
Forgive me.

230
00:15:25,934 --> 00:15:26,848
What can I do?

231
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:29,318
Master! Soldiers!

232
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:33,487
I will require you to speak in evidence.

233
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:37,772
- Before the King.
- I, really? Do you think l-I...

234
00:15:37,773 --> 00:15:38,975
Yes.

235
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,278
Good decision.

236
00:16:43,196 --> 00:16:44,915
Marian.

237
00:16:44,997 --> 00:16:46,751
Marian!

238
00:16:50,682 --> 00:16:53,597
The torches are on 
but there 's no one home.

239
00:16:53,685 --> 00:16:56,838
Oh, that's like Much.

240
00:16:56,928 --> 00:16:58,886
Yeah, very funny.

241
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:02,324
- Where is she?
- Maybe she's run away

242
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:05,293
- to avoid marrying Gisborne.
- Not Marian.

243
00:17:05,376 --> 00:17:07,527
She's not the running kind.

244
00:17:07,618 --> 00:17:10,088
Well, let's come back tomorrow.

245
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,138
We can wait.

246
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:16,938
I know where she is. Quick.

247
00:17:17,026 --> 00:17:19,304
- She's stealing Gisborne's money!
- Oh, good work.

248
00:17:23,712 --> 00:17:25,909
Sir Guy! The Nightwatchman.

249
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:40,800
Open up.

250
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:42,846
There 's no escape.

251
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:46,971
Get me an ax. You two, outside,
cover the windows in case he jumps.

252
00:18:12,037 --> 00:18:13,995
Time to play, Nightwatchman.

253
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,880
Ah, ah, ah! Mind if I join in?

254
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:26,609
Locksley!

255
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:30,653
Have you heard the news?

256
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,171
I'm to marry Marian.

257
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:48,947
I will think about you
when I take her to the marriage bed.

258
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:05,282
Get the money!

259
00:19:08,449 --> 00:19:10,726
- I've got it.
- Go, go.

260
00:19:13,454 --> 00:19:14,524
Good night, gents.

261
00:19:15,335 --> 00:19:18,695
Split up, twos and threes.
You know where to meet.

262
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,911
Gotcha.

263
00:19:46,244 --> 00:19:48,202
What do you think you're doing?

264
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:50,882
This Nightwatchman business
will be the death of you.

265
00:19:50,968 --> 00:19:53,086
These are my last days as the Nightwatchman.

266
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:55,561
I will not be able to do it
when I am at Locksley.

267
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,645
You do not have to go back to Locksley.

268
00:19:57,735 --> 00:20:00,456
I told you. You do not have to marry him.

269
00:20:00,537 --> 00:20:02,655
- I have no choice.
- No.

270
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:07,383
I was coming to tell you
I have the proof I need.

271
00:20:07,463 --> 00:20:10,105
The physician, the physician will talk.

272
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:12,769
I found him and he agreed to give evidence.

273
00:20:12,977 --> 00:20:14,759
He did not treat Gisborne.

274
00:20:14,794 --> 00:20:16,646
Gisborne was not there.

275
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:20,833
- He was in the Holy Land.
- And he will say this in public?

276
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:25,395
Really?

277
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,437
Thank you.

278
00:20:27,522 --> 00:20:29,594
I do not know how to thank you.

279
00:20:29,684 --> 00:20:31,880
We'll think of something.

280
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:34,095
Come on.

281
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:42,774
Robin...

282
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:47,580
Marian?

283
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,262
No sign of anyone.

284
00:21:00,352 --> 00:21:04,634
I don't understand. Where are they?

285
00:21:07,198 --> 00:21:08,758
John!

286
00:21:10,242 --> 00:21:12,279
John!

287
00:21:21,612 --> 00:21:24,253
I've got her. I've got her.

288
00:21:24,335 --> 00:21:26,054
All right, all right.

289
00:21:26,135 --> 00:21:27,695
- Gisborne stabbed her.
- What?

290
00:21:27,777 --> 00:21:29,849
- In the belly.
- It is a shallow wound,

291
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,738
not serious.

292
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:37,539
We need dry bedding.
She needs to get dry.

293
00:21:37,626 --> 00:21:40,222
- Get a light.
- Here.

294
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:42,381
John. John!

295
00:21:44,272 --> 00:21:47,267
I need clean water to wash the wound.

296
00:21:47,355 --> 00:21:49,792
Here, here.

297
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:53,159
- Do you have wine?
- A little.

298
00:21:53,241 --> 00:21:55,279
- For the pain.
- Yes.

299
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:03,285
This is not long. What did he use?

300
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,123
I don't know.

301
00:22:05,212 --> 00:22:06,931
- I thought he punched her.
- A dagger.

302
00:22:09,776 --> 00:22:11,415
Can you feel this?

303
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,411
Should you be pressing there?

304
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,777
I need to look inside. Wine.

305
00:22:15,862 --> 00:22:17,420
Here.

306
00:22:19,745 --> 00:22:21,783
This will hurt. Are you brave?

307
00:22:23,068 --> 00:22:24,469
Do it.

308
00:22:26,271 --> 00:22:28,947
Keep breathing.

309
00:22:31,036 --> 00:22:33,871
- Good.
- She will be all right?

310
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:39,319
I need to sew. Give me a needle.

311
00:22:43,287 --> 00:22:46,441
This needle is thick and blunt.

312
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,763
- Are you prepared?
- Is this the way you sell it?

313
00:22:50,854 --> 00:22:52,732
Give it to me.

314
00:22:58,661 --> 00:23:00,221
Ah!

315
00:23:03,065 --> 00:23:07,301
Ho, ho, ho! Look at this! 
This is great stuff.

316
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,824
The others will be waiting for us.

317
00:23:09,911 --> 00:23:12,029
Yeah.

318
00:23:13,114 --> 00:23:15,311
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

319
00:23:15,396 --> 00:23:16,788
No.

320
00:23:16,838 --> 00:23:18,419
If you're not thinking it,
how do you know?

321
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,999
I don't think like you do.

322
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,072
I'm not being funny, maybe you should.

323
00:23:22,654 --> 00:23:25,271
What, you think Robin's gonna
need us when he's a lord again?

324
00:23:25,306 --> 00:23:26,776
Yeah?

325
00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:28,400
It's all right for them, innit?
Much with his lodge.

326
00:23:28,401 --> 00:23:30,159
What are we gonna have?

327
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,566
- This should go to the poor.
- That's us now.

328
00:23:34,637 --> 00:23:38,253
Look, we were outlaws, right? We had a job.

329
00:23:38,338 --> 00:23:40,899
We've got nothing now, we are the poor.

330
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:45,223
- You know what this is?
- What?

331
00:23:45,304 --> 00:23:47,137
Severance pay.

332
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,706
- All right?
- Yes, thank you, Djaq.

333
00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:54,306
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

334
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,862
I did not think you would be so brave.

335
00:24:09,987 --> 00:24:12,568
- Any sign of Allan or Will?
- No.

336
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:18,723
Well, the bad news is you've been stabbed.

337
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,697
But the good news is you don't have
to marry the man that stabbed you.

338
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:26,695
- And what will happen?
- When the King comes to Nottingham...

339
00:24:26,783 --> 00:24:28,342
I'll make an entrance.

340
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:31,020
He will let me speak, he trusts me.

341
00:24:31,107 --> 00:24:33,862
I will present the evidence,
the physician will corroborate it,

342
00:24:33,949 --> 00:24:36,944
and... and Gisborne will be done for.

343
00:24:37,032 --> 00:24:38,546
Will he hang?

344
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:41,475
Yes.

345
00:24:42,657 --> 00:24:46,369
Marian, this is a man
who would force you to marry him.

346
00:24:46,461 --> 00:24:48,931
A man who tried to kill the King,
a man who stabbed you.

347
00:24:49,022 --> 00:24:51,820
Even so, I will never support hanging.

348
00:24:54,107 --> 00:24:55,861
What?

349
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,268
No, tell me.

350
00:25:03,556 --> 00:25:05,594
I think you feel for him.

351
00:25:05,678 --> 00:25:07,237
He's a human being.

352
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,073
Hardly.

353
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,438
- You are stirred by him.
- Stirred?

354
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:16,045
He said it.

355
00:25:16,127 --> 00:25:18,359
- And he was right, wasn't he?
- Grow up.

356
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,968
Well, this morning when you thought
you had to marry him,

357
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:24,570
you were happily resigned to your fate.

358
00:25:25,656 --> 00:25:29,653
His... qualities and his genuine feelings.

359
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:32,894
- I was trying to be brave.
- But why?

360
00:25:32,983 --> 00:25:37,060
- This whole Nightwatchman thing, it's...
- What whole Nightwatchman thing?

361
00:25:37,147 --> 00:25:40,222
I am only doing what you do
but with more intelligence.

362
00:25:43,032 --> 00:25:45,595
You would have thought
you would have learnt by now.

363
00:25:45,675 --> 00:25:49,911
Every time you go out,
you get arrested or stabbed or betrothed.

364
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,281
You should stay at home
and do your embroidery.

365
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:04,704
I did not mean that.

366
00:26:04,705 --> 00:26:07,434
Even my father,
who is old and infirm,

367
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:11,088
and has a lot more to lose than you do,
even he supports me more than you do.

368
00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:13,819
- Ah!
- Marian, you need to sleep.

369
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:29,813
You think Marian'll want anything to eat?

370
00:26:29,883 --> 00:26:31,236
What is it girls eat?

371
00:26:31,237 --> 00:26:33,309
Special girls ' food.

372
00:26:34,522 --> 00:26:36,049
You know what I mean.

373
00:26:36,257 --> 00:26:38,763
Ask her yourself what she wants to eat.

374
00:26:38,994 --> 00:26:40,093
She's still asleep.

375
00:26:40,151 --> 00:26:42,859
I gave her a nudge earlier
but she didn't wake up.

376
00:26:43,688 --> 00:26:45,247
Really?

377
00:26:45,931 --> 00:26:47,684
Still?

378
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,098
Marian. Wake up.

379
00:26:58,182 --> 00:27:00,060
You said to let her sleep.

380
00:27:00,144 --> 00:27:03,616
This is not sleeping.
This is her body shutting down.

381
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:06,485
Gisborne's knife
caused damage inside.

382
00:27:06,486 --> 00:27:07,619
I must open the wound.

383
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:09,992
Marian! Marian!

384
00:27:12,514 --> 00:27:14,347
I don't feel well.

385
00:27:15,237 --> 00:27:18,516
- I need clean instruments.
- What instruments?

386
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,640
You stay here. Hold her hand. I'll be quick.

387
00:27:22,404 --> 00:27:24,236
Do not let her sleep.

388
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:27,045
- Marian.
- Mm...

389
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:29,086
- Marian.
- Mm-hm.

390
00:27:30,051 --> 00:27:31,611
Marian.

391
00:27:36,817 --> 00:27:39,492
- She awake?
- Only just.

392
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,542
Now, does she want an egg
or does she want some bacon?

393
00:27:43,623 --> 00:27:45,981
She can't have both, I don't care who she is.

394
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:49,061
Pray to your god, and to mine.

395
00:27:49,148 --> 00:27:50,468
She is going to die.

396
00:27:53,393 --> 00:27:54,981
Die? What do you mean, die?

397
00:27:54,982 --> 00:27:56,139
Her face.

398
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:59,951
I have seen that look a thousand times before.

399
00:28:04,002 --> 00:28:06,641
W-W-What do we do?

400
00:28:06,872 --> 00:28:08,473
I need hot water.

401
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:11,609
I need clean instruments. Knives.

402
00:28:11,782 --> 00:28:13,846
- Yes, er...
- And here.

403
00:28:13,931 --> 00:28:16,401
Grind this into a fine paste. Now.

404
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:18,407
Yes. Er, er, now.

405
00:28:19,696 --> 00:28:23,409
I should go home. 
My father will be worried.

406
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,538
All in good time.

407
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:28,696
- I am a nuisance.
- Yes, you are.

408
00:28:28,785 --> 00:28:30,743
You were supposed to say no.

409
00:28:30,827 --> 00:28:33,104
And you should be at home
doing your embroidery.

410
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:36,343
Right, here is the paste,

411
00:28:36,432 --> 00:28:39,427
and, er, the instruments are coming,

412
00:28:39,514 --> 00:28:41,712
and, er, Djaq is...

413
00:28:42,397 --> 00:28:44,469
Djaq is, er, coming, and I'm...

414
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,119
I'm sure... I'm sure of...

415
00:28:46,201 --> 00:28:48,194
I'm sure, I'm sure?

416
00:28:48,283 --> 00:28:49,683
I am sure.

417
00:28:49,764 --> 00:28:52,839
"I am sure" is reassuring.

418
00:28:52,927 --> 00:28:55,603
"I am sure, I am sure" is not.

419
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:57,647
I am sure.

420
00:28:57,732 --> 00:29:01,808
It's just, er, Djaq is, er, very... er...

421
00:29:01,895 --> 00:29:04,207
Djaq is very what?

422
00:29:04,297 --> 00:29:06,416
- I'll shut up.
- Good idea.

423
00:29:06,499 --> 00:29:08,254
Yeah. I'll go.

424
00:29:09,902 --> 00:29:12,214
Er... drink this.

425
00:29:12,305 --> 00:29:14,103
All of it.

426
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:18,190
Much.

427
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,228
He means well.

428
00:29:21,313 --> 00:29:23,875
What can Djaq have told him?

429
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:29,071
This is not good, is it?

430
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:34,518
Tell me the truth.

431
00:29:35,486 --> 00:29:37,399
Maybe not so good.

432
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,329
Here.

433
00:29:49,139 --> 00:29:50,493
I will cut you open.

434
00:29:52,622 --> 00:29:54,854
If I can find the damage, I will sew it up.

435
00:29:56,706 --> 00:29:59,859
- What are my chances?
- If I do not do this, none.

436
00:29:59,949 --> 00:30:01,862
If I do, very little.

437
00:30:06,074 --> 00:30:08,955
My father treated the wounded
in the battlefield.

438
00:30:09,758 --> 00:30:13,390
He said never lie to a wounded man.

439
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:16,237
Or was it never lie to a dying man?

440
00:30:18,285 --> 00:30:20,198
He said that too.

441
00:30:27,454 --> 00:30:29,412
So?

442
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:31,328
Never lie to a dying man.

443
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:33,375
You are not going to die.

444
00:30:34,621 --> 00:30:38,139
- And I have never lied to you.
- Oh, come on.

445
00:30:38,224 --> 00:30:40,694
We have never once spoken the truth
to each other.

446
00:30:40,786 --> 00:30:42,665
Now is not the time to argue.

447
00:30:42,748 --> 00:30:45,584
Do not tell me when it is the time to argue.

448
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,471
What?

449
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:50,672
Well, I do not think
there can be much wrong with you.

450
00:30:50,755 --> 00:30:52,713
I am serious.

451
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:58,033
We have never once
spoken the truth to each other.

452
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:01,197
For instance, I call you a fool
when I mean you are a hero.

453
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,831
I criticize your actions...

454
00:31:03,832 --> 00:31:06,713
and then mimic them
myself as the Nightwatchman.

455
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:10,919
- I chastise Robin Hood...
- Shh.

456
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,055
I will not be shushed,
these might be my last words.

457
00:31:15,618 --> 00:31:17,576
No, they will not be, they cannot be.

458
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:23,576
Because we should be together.

459
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:26,501
I should never have left you,
I should never have gone to war.

460
00:31:26,588 --> 00:31:28,421
It was a mistake.

461
00:31:29,511 --> 00:31:31,468
And you were right.

462
00:31:32,113 --> 00:31:34,071
I wanted glory.

463
00:31:34,916 --> 00:31:37,193
But believe me...

464
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:39,715
the battlefield is the last place you will find it.

465
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,157
You would have always regretted it
if you hadn't gone.

466
00:31:42,243 --> 00:31:44,200
But not as much as I regret going.

467
00:31:45,806 --> 00:31:47,605
Not as much as I regret losing you.

468
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:53,248
Marian. I should not have gone.

469
00:31:54,214 --> 00:31:55,203
Robin...

470
00:31:55,295 --> 00:31:59,292
I love you, you love me,
we all love each other.

471
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:01,132
Drink the wine.

472
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:09,223
Here, lift.

473
00:32:12,111 --> 00:32:13,670
Robin, hold her.

474
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:24,157
It's too...

475
00:32:26,107 --> 00:32:26,374
Master?

476
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:29,012
Can't reach it without
causing further damage.

477
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:32,006
- Master.
- Robin, press here. Stop the bleeding.

478
00:32:37,814 --> 00:32:39,817
- I cannot!
- What?

479
00:32:40,361 --> 00:32:41,448
I am not trained,

480
00:32:41,449 --> 00:32:43,785
I don't have the right instruments,
I can't do it.

481
00:32:43,786 --> 00:32:46,097
- Much, put your finger here.
- Me?

482
00:32:46,182 --> 00:32:48,140
Yes, you. Come on.

483
00:32:49,905 --> 00:32:51,977
- I need to get the physician.
- There is no time.

484
00:32:54,229 --> 00:32:56,746
- Make me time.
- Be quick.

485
00:32:56,831 --> 00:32:58,789
- Here?
- Yes!

486
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:09,113
Yeah, this is it.

487
00:33:10,044 --> 00:33:12,606
The Great North Road.

488
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:17,919
So which way are we gonna go?
Back to the cave, or pastures new?

489
00:33:18,011 --> 00:33:20,325
What if they need our help, the others?

490
00:33:20,326 --> 00:33:21,598
What for?

491
00:33:21,694 --> 00:33:23,368
They got away.

492
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:27,891
Where 'd your old man go, and your brother,
when they ran away?

493
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,134
Scarborough. My Auntie Annie.

494
00:33:32,865 --> 00:33:35,142
Well.

495
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,912
I wouldn't mind meeting your Auntie Annie.

496
00:33:41,993 --> 00:33:44,111
What do you reckon?

497
00:33:44,195 --> 00:33:46,152
You know what I was thinking?

498
00:33:46,757 --> 00:33:48,636
I was thinking Robin would want this for us.

499
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:50,677
He would. He'd want the best for us.

500
00:34:17,946 --> 00:34:21,339
Pitts. Pitts!

501
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,307
Yes, yes, what is it?

502
00:34:24,392 --> 00:34:27,944
I need your help.
A friend of mine has been stabbed. She...

503
00:34:28,716 --> 00:34:31,187
- She is close to death.
- Bring her here.

504
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:32,720
I cannot.

505
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,757
I will take you to her.
I have brought you a horse.

506
00:34:34,758 --> 00:34:35,543
Well, where is she?

507
00:34:35,544 --> 00:34:38,112
I need to know in case anybody...

508
00:34:38,113 --> 00:34:40,203
We must leave now, there is no time.

509
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,483
All right. Let me get my things.

510
00:34:48,134 --> 00:34:50,570
- Hurry up.
- Don't worry, my friend.

511
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:52,614
Everything is under control.

512
00:35:06,431 --> 00:35:08,389
Hurry. Come on!

513
00:35:13,036 --> 00:35:14,994
Hurry up.

514
00:35:18,322 --> 00:35:20,279
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

515
00:35:23,927 --> 00:35:25,327
Bandages.

516
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,490
All right.

517
00:35:29,572 --> 00:35:31,929
Let's see. Yes, yes.

518
00:35:43,186 --> 00:35:45,364
I'm not doing anything,
I'm just pressing, right?

519
00:35:45,595 --> 00:35:48,106
Yes. There 's not much else we can do.

520
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:50,629
The physician has the instruments.

521
00:35:50,698 --> 00:35:52,526
Should I be able to feel a heartbeat?

522
00:35:52,642 --> 00:35:54,158
Yes.

523
00:36:07,568 --> 00:36:10,703
- What are you doing? You'll hurt her.
- Trust me, Much.

524
00:36:10,704 --> 00:36:13,204
Where she is, she cannot feel a thing.

525
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:26,641
Oh, come on, come on, Marian.

526
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,405
Yes, yes!

527
00:36:43,995 --> 00:36:45,354
Allah be praised!

528
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:48,825
- Allah be praised!
- Allah be praised!

529
00:36:48,826 --> 00:36:51,805
- How did you do that?
- Put your finger back in. Now!

530
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,928
This will happen again.

531
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:57,047
Where is the physician?
I cannot do it.

532
00:36:57,293 --> 00:36:58,898
Djaq, Djaq!

533
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:00,461
Djaq!

534
00:37:02,538 --> 00:37:04,291
Much! John!

535
00:37:06,822 --> 00:37:09,179
- How is she?
- Alive.

536
00:37:14,229 --> 00:37:16,187
You have to save her.

537
00:37:17,632 --> 00:37:19,706
Science is advanced but...

538
00:37:19,707 --> 00:37:21,651
we're always in the hands of the Lord.

539
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:25,198
Here. You give her this.

540
00:37:25,278 --> 00:37:28,567
It's a draught for the surgery.
Put a little on her tongue.

541
00:37:34,387 --> 00:37:36,842
She has a dagger wound near the liver,

542
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:39,207
a leaking blood vessel, I have sewn it up.

543
00:37:39,292 --> 00:37:41,125
- You've been trained?
- A little.

544
00:37:41,213 --> 00:37:45,169
Good, good. Then you've probably saved her life.

545
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:47,055
She has saved her life.

546
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:52,655
If you agree, I can close up the wound.

547
00:37:52,744 --> 00:37:54,304
Very good. Close away.

548
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:57,299
Do you have clean needle?

549
00:37:57,388 --> 00:37:59,267
Thread? Cloth?

550
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,671
Oh. Yes.

551
00:38:18,328 --> 00:38:20,081
Excuse me.

552
00:39:22,907 --> 00:39:24,581
What have I done?

553
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:35,347
Much! John! Your weapons, now!

554
00:39:35,976 --> 00:39:37,029
Why?

555
00:39:37,237 --> 00:39:38,892
Unless I am badly mistaken,

556
00:39:38,893 --> 00:39:41,218
the Sheriff and Gisborne
will arrive at any moment.

557
00:39:41,403 --> 00:39:42,784
We'll be surrounded.

558
00:39:43,428 --> 00:39:45,334
What? We've gotta run!

559
00:39:45,473 --> 00:39:47,383
We cannot run. I cannot run!

560
00:39:48,343 --> 00:39:52,325
- Marian.
- We do not run.

561
00:39:53,071 --> 00:39:54,764
We are trapped in a
cave and surrounded.

562
00:39:54,765 --> 00:39:56,396
We're all gonna die.

563
00:39:56,534 --> 00:39:57,672
Yes.

564
00:39:58,131 --> 00:39:59,532
Oh, Lord.

565
00:40:07,928 --> 00:40:11,129
Allan. Where is Allan?

566
00:40:11,212 --> 00:40:13,774
And Will! Where are they?

567
00:40:16,496 --> 00:40:19,201
I thought if I survived the Holy Land

568
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:22,003
then I would die by the fire in Locksley,

569
00:40:22,084 --> 00:40:24,607
not in some... forest

570
00:40:24,711 --> 00:40:27,816
in some... poxy, poxy...

571
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:29,370
- cave!
- Much!

572
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:31,141
- What?
- Let me think!

573
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:38,315
You.

574
00:40:39,529 --> 00:40:41,315
What did you think?

575
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:43,012
That Gisborne did not tell me

576
00:40:43,013 --> 00:40:45,489
that one day somebody
might come asking about his alibi?

577
00:40:45,523 --> 00:40:49,206
That we did not have a plan in place
for just this occasion?

578
00:40:50,867 --> 00:40:52,685
The charade is over.

579
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:59,091
Your friend is dead.

580
00:41:00,442 --> 00:41:01,993
Dead?

581
00:41:02,317 --> 00:41:03,705
Dead.

582
00:41:17,712 --> 00:41:19,467
Robin.

583
00:41:22,267 --> 00:41:23,656
I'm sorry.

584
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:12,842
Marian.

585
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:16,325
Marian!

586
00:42:25,055 --> 00:42:26,808
Marian.

587
00:42:29,178 --> 00:42:31,136
I love you.

588
00:42:34,241 --> 00:42:35,901
I should have said.

589
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:39,847
Why did I not say?

590
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:45,065
I love you.

591
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:47,226
Marian.

592
00:42:47,635 --> 00:42:49,273
I love you.

593
00:42:55,523 --> 00:42:57,402
Marian.

594
00:43:13,658 --> 00:43:15,602
Robin!

595
00:43:15,625 --> 00:43:20,690
Robin! Come out, come out, wherever you are!
