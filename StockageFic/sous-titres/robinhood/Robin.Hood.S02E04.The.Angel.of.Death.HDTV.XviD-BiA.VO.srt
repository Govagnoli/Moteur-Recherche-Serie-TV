00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:16,542
This is an ambush!

2
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,993
A little of what you have could
be a lot for the poor of Nottingham!

3
00:01:21,073 --> 00:01:24,361
- But we are the poor!
- Let them take what they need, Lukey.

4
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:27,867
Dad?

5
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:30,740
Dad! It's me, it's Will!

6
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,969
Will, you know these people?

7
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:44,182
I'd like you to meet
my father Dan Scarlett

8
00:01:44,449 --> 00:01:46,030
and my little brother Lukey.

9
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,021
- I'm not little!
- My big little brother, Lukey.

EPISODE 4
THE ANGEL OF DEATH

16
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:35,243
So what brings you back to Nottingham?

17
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:37,455
We've come to take Will
back to Scarborough with us.

18
00:02:37,535 --> 00:02:39,020
- What?
- Hey?

19
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:42,557
What about asking me
if I want to come?

20
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,755
We're your family.
Your Auntie Annie and us.

21
00:02:44,835 --> 00:02:48,547
- I've got a family here too, Dad.
- We were sure you'd come and find us.

22
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,856
- Didn't you miss us?
- Yes. But...

23
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:53,844
I'm with Robin now.

24
00:02:55,605 --> 00:02:57,140
"I'm with Robin now"?!

25
00:02:58,058 --> 00:03:01,087
Son, you've got your
whole life ahead of you.

26
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:16,967
What's that?

27
00:03:16,976 --> 00:03:18,327
It's a letter.

28
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,538
Yeah, to who?

29
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:22,738
It's to the King.

30
00:03:22,818 --> 00:03:25,227
- What about?
- The Sheriff and the Black Knights.

31
00:03:25,307 --> 00:03:27,635
-  Who's delivering it?
- An old friend.

32
00:03:29,355 --> 00:03:30,552
Roger of Stoke.

33
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:31,720
Roger.

34
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:35,993
Where are you meeting him? 

35
00:03:36,073 --> 00:03:37,416
How many questions 
have you got Allan!?

36
00:03:37,496 --> 00:03:39,569
Yeah, all right! 
Just curious.

37
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:43,446
I'm meeting him in Nottingham
after the money drop.

38
00:03:45,895 --> 00:03:49,295
- This craftsmanship is good. 
- <i>See?</i>

39
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,401
I've got a life here. 

40
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:54,228
What that says to me is you could 
earn a decent living in Scarborough.

41
00:03:54,308 --> 00:03:57,523
Dad, I'm an outlaw.
I stand up for what I believe in.

42
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:59,764
- What and I don't? 
- It doesn't matter.

43
00:03:59,844 --> 00:04:01,391
Yes, it does. Tell me.

44
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:04,949
- You let the Sheriff cut off your hand! 
- That was to save me and you!

45
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:07,636
- No, I didn't mean that. 
- Yes, you did.

46
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:14,559
Robin, could you tell my father I'm a 
grown man now. I make my own decisions. 

47
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,288
A real man listens to advice, Will.

48
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:20,796
Thanks, Robin.

49
00:04:20,797 --> 00:04:22,891
But Will does have a life here.

50
00:04:23,536 --> 00:04:25,720
And you should see it before you
take him away from it.

51
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:28,875
Come to Nottingham tomorrow.
Let me show you what we do.

52
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:31,529
NOTTINGHAM TOWN

53
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:38,884
<i>- Look it's him.
- Jess, it is the Nightwatchman.</i>

54
00:04:51,215 --> 00:04:54,354
Let's see, what did he bring?

55
00:04:54,355 --> 00:04:56,357
God bless you, Nightwatchman.

56
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:07,765
And that night, the Angel of the 
Lord went back and forth...

57
00:05:17,015 --> 00:05:20,697
Ah! The Nightwatchman.

58
00:05:20,698 --> 00:05:24,595
So how was
your evening's... generosity?

59
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:26,656
Very satisfying.

60
00:05:26,657 --> 00:05:29,127
They all took the bait like rats.

61
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,195
Good.

62
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:34,456
Shouldn't you be...

63
00:05:34,457 --> 00:05:37,483
measuring or whatever
it is that you do?

64
00:05:37,563 --> 00:05:39,938
- Scientific analysis. 
- Right.

65
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,969
Well, I am waiting to be accidentally
caught in the quarantine.

66
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:45,248
Yes...

67
00:05:47,257 --> 00:05:48,409
The ermm...

68
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,739
pestilent poor of Pitt Street...

69
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,974
Off you go.

70
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:03,859
Please!

71
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:06,734
- Please Jailer, let me see my father!
- Can't be done. 

72
00:06:06,814 --> 00:06:08,656
- I've told you.
- Marian!

73
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:12,168
- I am well.
- I will speak to the Sheriff.

74
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:14,698
Do not worry. Speak away, my dear.

75
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:15,816
Sheriff...

76
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:20,785
Look, this punishment 
hurts my father, not me.

77
00:06:20,952 --> 00:06:23,456
Oh, I don't know.
I think it hurts you both.

78
00:06:23,457 --> 00:06:25,019
It is efficient.

79
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,495
It'll make you think before you
undermine my authority again.

80
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:32,238
Which, trust me,
is in your best interests.

81
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:36,497
Please! Sheriff.

82
00:06:36,498 --> 00:06:39,618
There must be something I can do.
Guy!?

83
00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:45,735
It's no good making those big eyes
at him, he doesn't want you any more.

84
00:06:45,736 --> 00:06:48,975
Tell you what,
you read this announcement for me,

85
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:52,258
and we'll see if we can
get daddy some dinner.

86
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:53,938
You mean you haven't fed him!?

87
00:06:57,335 --> 00:07:00,219
Sheriff?

88
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,737
Right, time to spread a bit of...

89
00:07:02,738 --> 00:07:06,865
Happiness. Yes, that's right,
time to spread a bit of happiness.

90
00:07:14,075 --> 00:07:15,698
Bless you...

91
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:17,594
See, these people need us.

92
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:20,319
We need you too. You're family.

93
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,619
Help me, somebody please, help me!

94
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,600
Robin, Robin...

95
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:27,994
Robin, help! It's Jess.

96
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:30,895
She's got something! I think
it's the pestilence! Let me see.

97
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:32,601
Will, get Djaq.

98
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,819
There's no swellings.
How long has she been like this?

99
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,996
Just since this morning.

100
00:07:40,997 --> 00:07:42,495
Toot toot...

101
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:45,123
TRUMPETERS PLAY FANFARE

102
00:07:50,955 --> 00:07:53,185
People of Nottingham. Louder.

103
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,599
People of Nottingham. Good.

104
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,835
On behalf of the Sheriff...

105
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:02,256
I make the following announcement.

106
00:08:02,257 --> 00:08:04,735
The pestilence has
come to Nottingham.

107
00:08:06,295 --> 00:08:08,577
My God, Jess. That's what it is.

108
00:08:08,578 --> 00:08:10,394
No, it's not. Do not be afraid.

109
00:08:10,395 --> 00:08:13,359
It is confined to the
houses in Pitt Street.

110
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,116
There will be a quarantine
placed around the street.

111
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:18,919
No-one is to pass
through without permission.

112
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,155
No-one is to pass food
or medicine...

113
00:08:22,156 --> 00:08:24,517
What? There's young ones suffering.

114
00:08:24,518 --> 00:08:27,037
They can't be cut off with nothing.

115
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:29,078
To do so...

116
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:33,057
risks spreading the infection,
and will be punished by death.

117
00:08:37,955 --> 00:08:39,774
What are we going to do?
She's going to die!

118
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:42,238
No, she isn't.
That's not what she's got.

119
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,358
Sarah. Take Jess home.

120
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:46,116
Djaq and I will come soon.

121
00:08:46,117 --> 00:08:50,957
Be careful. We will not
be cowed by this infection.

122
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,158
Business will continue as normal.

123
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:57,295
All workers are to report to the castle for
duty at their usual hour. What's Marian's game?

124
00:08:57,296 --> 00:09:00,956
She's just doing as she's told. Now.

125
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,838
You may hear cries for help.

126
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:04,516
Pleas for mercy.

127
00:09:04,517 --> 00:09:08,038
Medicine. Help me! Help me! Help me!

128
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,559
A word of advice.

129
00:09:15,295 --> 00:09:17,295
Go forth... in peace...

130
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:18,795
love and serve...

131
00:09:18,796 --> 00:09:22,356
Robin, without food and water, he's
condemning a whole street to death.

132
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:26,840
...your Sheriff.
Sheriff! This is not right!

133
00:09:26,841 --> 00:09:28,336
Dan! Dan!

134
00:09:30,315 --> 00:09:35,035
What? I've just had a look at a little
lass and it's not the pestilence.

135
00:09:35,036 --> 00:09:39,399
Get that man shut up. I've seen the
pestilence before, in Scarborough.

136
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,456
These people must have food
and water. And medicines.

137
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:45,955
I said SHUT UP!

138
00:09:45,956 --> 00:09:49,478
I've shut up for you
once before, Sheriff.

139
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:52,955
It's cost me my wife,
my hand and the respect of my son.

140
00:09:52,956 --> 00:09:55,216
So I'm not shutting up any more.

141
00:09:55,217 --> 00:09:57,599
Now why are you saying
this is the pestilence...

142
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,644
DA-A-A-AD!
PEOPLE SCREAM

143
00:10:13,075 --> 00:10:16,337
Well, done Hysteria.

144
00:10:16,338 --> 00:10:18,655
Panic.

145
00:10:18,656 --> 00:10:21,634
In times of crisis,
not very helpful.

146
00:10:21,635 --> 00:10:23,603
It will not be tolerated!

147
00:10:27,755 --> 00:10:29,798
Will, you can't go up there!

148
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:33,477
I'm going to kill him.
You heard the Sheriff.

149
00:10:33,478 --> 00:10:35,954
Set up those barricades!

150
00:10:35,955 --> 00:10:39,078
There's too many of them, Will.
It'd be suicide. I don't care!

151
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:40,576
Will.

152
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:53,707
We need to go to Pitt Street.

153
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,111
Pitt Street, why?

154
00:10:56,112 --> 00:10:58,870
There are people there. Our people.

155
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:01,436
They need us.

156
00:11:01,437 --> 00:11:04,435
Djaq? Of course. Robin.

157
00:11:04,436 --> 00:11:07,438
The pestilence.
I'm not sure either, to be honest.

158
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:09,244
I think Dan was right.

159
00:11:09,245 --> 00:11:14,003
There is no pestilence. That's why
the Sheriff killed him. You think?!

160
00:11:14,004 --> 00:11:18,559
Now! We haven't got time for this. Help!
They're setting the barricades up now.

161
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,799
Please help us. Now come on!

162
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,279
I tell you what, I'll do the letter
for whatshisname... Roger of Stoke.

163
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,679
Good thinking. Here, go on.

164
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,239
The rest of you,
I can't ask you to risk your life.

165
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,664
But if you do come with me,
then do it for Dan. Now come on.

166
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,881
Will, Pitt Street, the back way.

167
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:44,380
Now!

168
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:58,321
Put your backs into it!

169
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:10,799
Let me through. I do not live here.

170
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,279
I was just only walking this way. I'm
from Leicester. Sheriff's orders.

171
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,221
This has got nothing to do with me!

172
00:12:18,222 --> 00:12:20,139
Don't do this!

173
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,300
Don't do this! My Jess needs help!
Sarah!

174
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:26,102
Robin. Oh, no, you can't be here.

175
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:28,483
You'll never get out.
I said I'd come and find you.

176
00:12:28,484 --> 00:12:32,381
Take us to your daughter. Come on.
Let's see what we can do.

177
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:47,384
She needs water, lots of water.

178
00:12:47,385 --> 00:12:50,082
Are there many other
people affected?

179
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,104
Half the houses on the street.

180
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:58,399
Right. I want beds.

181
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,298
Clean linens...

182
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:03,779
All in one place. Go.

183
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,169
And all the herbs and medicines from
every house brought here to Djaq.

184
00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:10,942
Hey, hey. Luke...

185
00:13:10,943 --> 00:13:13,621
Luke. Your dad wouldn't want this.

186
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:15,662
How do you know what he'd want?

187
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:19,660
We should kill the Sheriff...
We can't just kill the Sheriff.

188
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:25,023
Prince John would send an army to destroy
Nottingham. It would create hell. Robin,

189
00:13:25,024 --> 00:13:28,063
I want to take him home.

190
00:13:28,064 --> 00:13:29,841
To Scarborough.

191
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,824
Our Auntie Annie.

192
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:33,662
If you need us here... No.

193
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:39,941
No, take him. And when you return,
we'll honour your father.

194
00:13:39,942 --> 00:13:41,440
Thank you.

195
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:56,239
Where's Sarah? Don't you know?
She lives in Pitt Street.

196
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,963
Is she affected?

197
00:13:57,964 --> 00:13:59,460
Little Jess.

198
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:03,301
Right.

199
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,241
We must get them medicine.

200
00:14:05,242 --> 00:14:07,548
And I need your clothes.

201
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,520
I'm sorry, Will.

202
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:15,020
Me too, Robin.

203
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:18,509
Really sorry.

204
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:15,440
We'll need to take food, as well.

205
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:19,944
No need, Miss. They're all fed. The
Nightwatchman visited last night on Pitt Street.

206
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:26,324
KNOCK

207
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,399
Don't come in.

208
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,243
Marian? You can't come in.

209
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:37,002
I cannot talk to
you through the door.

210
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:39,564
Well, then you can't talk
to me at all.

211
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,799
I just wanted to apologise...

212
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,763
for what happened today...
the way the Sheriff treated you.

213
00:15:44,764 --> 00:15:47,201
Am I to perform like a monkey,

214
00:15:47,202 --> 00:15:51,403
whilst my father starves in the dungeon? No...
I will see to it that your father is properly fed.

215
00:15:51,404 --> 00:15:55,642
Really? And what do you want
in return?

216
00:15:56,599 --> 00:16:00,046
Nothing. You have my word.

217
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:02,820
Then thank you.

218
00:16:02,821 --> 00:16:06,161
Marian, please...

219
00:16:06,162 --> 00:16:08,480
Let me in.

220
00:16:17,739 --> 00:16:21,682
The Nightwatchman
went to Pitt Street? Yes.

221
00:16:21,683 --> 00:16:23,440
KNOCK

222
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:27,523
Hello? It's Robin Hood. Do you have any
medicines or herbs you could give me?

223
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:32,807
Robin, please go away. We have the
pestilence here, save yourself.

224
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:41,624
What are you doing?
I'm helping the sick.

225
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,040
Leave them alone!

226
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:47,402
I mean... You could die.

227
00:16:47,403 --> 00:16:50,527
That's a risk I take every day.

228
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:55,322
No, you're right, forgive me.

229
00:16:55,323 --> 00:16:57,601
Let me help.

230
00:16:57,602 --> 00:17:00,259
What's your name? Joseph.

231
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,621
I'm here by mistake.

232
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:05,003
You're from Leicester, I heard.

233
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:08,782
Did you see the way
those men treated me? Godless.

234
00:17:08,783 --> 00:17:10,902
Welcome to Nottingham.

235
00:17:10,903 --> 00:17:13,261
Robin?

236
00:17:13,262 --> 00:17:15,824
These men are with me.

237
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:18,003
Can you help them?

238
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,679
These people are burning up!

239
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,866
You know, perhaps it would be a kindness
just not to interfere, not prolong their pain.

240
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,843
This is a medicine chest! Every
medicine known to man.

241
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,205
And some unknown.

242
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:39,659
Oh, don't do that! Why not?

243
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,840
I'm a man, you're a woman.

244
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:44,945
I fall in love very easily.
Don't worry, I don't.

245
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:59,299
Let me get down first, make sure it's safe.
I know what to look for better than you do.

246
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:04,589
Why do you always
treat me like I'm a baby?

247
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:18,059
I loved you, Luke.

248
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,823
See? Your turn.

249
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:26,944
Will? Run away, Luke.

250
00:18:26,945 --> 00:18:32,399
Run back to Scarborough. This place
is about to turn into hell.

251
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,942
Will?

252
00:18:34,943 --> 00:18:36,668
Will?!

253
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:45,819
She'll not die, will she?

254
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,458
Not if I can help it. And you are
from the fourth house on the street?

255
00:18:49,459 --> 00:18:52,401
And your husband ate a large
pie last night, nothing since?

256
00:18:52,402 --> 00:18:54,203
That's right.

257
00:18:54,204 --> 00:18:57,020
Good. Good?

258
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:04,639
She is hotter.
Look at the cheeks, the lips.

259
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,900
Are you trained in medicine? Me?

260
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:10,847
No. Just...
hoping this poor child recovers.

261
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,724
Don't go! Ah!

262
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:20,028
SHE SOBS

263
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:43,750
Stand, or you're dead.

264
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:14,088
A shame. A shame?

265
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:20,562
It's an outrage.
That's another life wasted.

266
00:20:20,563 --> 00:20:23,204
You suspect foul play? Joseph...

267
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:27,283
Joseph, this is Nottingham.
There is no other kind of play!

268
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:40,843
Will, you scared me! What are you doing
here, do you have a message from Robin?

269
00:20:40,844 --> 00:20:43,319
Will.

270
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:46,162
Will?

271
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,322
So...

272
00:20:52,323 --> 00:20:56,480
You're all from different families
and you haven't eaten together...

273
00:20:56,481 --> 00:20:58,958
We've all eaten the pies though.

274
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:01,358
Our Jess ate ours.

275
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:03,519
How much did she have? What pies?

276
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,642
The Nightwatchman's.

277
00:21:05,643 --> 00:21:09,162
He brought them all last night.
Every house in the street.

278
00:21:09,163 --> 00:21:11,525
Soup. I'll make everybody some soup.

279
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,603
They're all dropping
like flies, my Lord.

280
00:21:16,604 --> 00:21:20,968
The poison's lethal! Can't let
it fall into the wrong hands, eh?

281
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,082
I'm thinking of getting
a food taster, Gisborne...

282
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,840
with all this tasteless
poison around.

283
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:34,001
What do you think? Good idea.

284
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,919
Mm...

285
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,047
Maybe I'll eat half an hour
after you do.

286
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:23,284
What have you got for me?

287
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:28,501
What's the matter?

288
00:22:28,502 --> 00:22:30,490
A conscience?

289
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:34,623
How much for this?

290
00:22:34,624 --> 00:22:37,199
It depends what this is.

291
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,099
This is a letter to
King Richard from Robin.

292
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,302
Telling him all about you and
the Sheriff and the Black Knights.

293
00:22:43,303 --> 00:22:47,423
Game will be ugly, Gisborne.

294
00:22:47,424 --> 00:22:49,542
Give me that.

295
00:22:49,543 --> 00:22:52,902
I can't. I told Robin I'd
give it to Roger of Stoke,

296
00:22:52,903 --> 00:22:55,261
who's coming to take it to the King.

297
00:22:55,262 --> 00:22:58,420
So what's your proposal?
I'll give it to him, then I'm clean.

298
00:22:58,421 --> 00:23:00,659
You can arrest him after I've
gone, somewhere out of town.

299
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:06,199
I don't know anything about it.
Good, you're learning, Allan.

300
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:18,703
Hey. Stop!

301
00:23:18,704 --> 00:23:21,384
I have seen you!

302
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:26,522
No, you haven't.

303
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:33,462
You should come and eat.
Keep our strength up. All right.

304
00:23:33,463 --> 00:23:35,858
Thanks, Joseph. Robin.

305
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:42,862
Robin! Marian. What are you doing here?
Someone's impersonating me. I know.

306
00:23:42,863 --> 00:23:46,339
I think he's given out
poisoned pies. What?

307
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,978
In my name?!
It's the Sheriff's doing.

308
00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:52,139
But why? No idea.

309
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,860
He wants to damage the Nightwatchman's
reputation? Then he'd blame him. And he hasn't.

310
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:09,386
I need to see if Jess
is all right.

311
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,700
Smells good.

312
00:24:50,701 --> 00:24:55,625
Are you a cook? No, I'm a man of
science. What sort of science?

313
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,742
The science of elimination.

314
00:25:01,743 --> 00:25:04,820
What's that?
Finding ways to get rid of dirt.

315
00:25:04,821 --> 00:25:09,321
Have you noticed, there's dirt
everywhere? We have to get rid of it.

316
00:25:09,322 --> 00:25:12,740
And there are people who will make
the necessary difficult decisions.

317
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:17,422
Who don't need to be popular. You need to talk
to the Sheriff. He doesn't need to be popular.

318
00:25:17,423 --> 00:25:20,580
With the right tool,
we can clean this country,

319
00:25:20,581 --> 00:25:23,321
create a new England.

320
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:30,863
You should definitely
talk to the Sheriff.

321
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:39,986
Food!

322
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:45,065
Food. I'll take over.

323
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:57,804
You organised this?

324
00:25:57,805 --> 00:26:00,401
We had hospitals in the Holy Land.

325
00:26:00,402 --> 00:26:05,763
I thought it'd be the last time I'd see them. How
did you know there wasn't some infectious disease?

326
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,600
I didn't.

327
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,408
That was brave.

328
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:15,279
How did you know? I didn't.

329
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,882
Robin? Are you eating?

330
00:26:19,883 --> 00:26:22,321
In a moment. The others can start.

331
00:26:22,322 --> 00:26:24,082
No! I need you!

332
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,763
You should eat.

333
00:26:28,764 --> 00:26:31,364
I'll be there in a moment.

334
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:36,503
Robin! Robin! I know that man.

335
00:26:36,504 --> 00:26:41,081
I have seen him before in the
castle! He's advising the Sheriff.

336
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:47,720
And the Lord said, "Take, eat,
do this in memory of me".

337
00:26:47,721 --> 00:26:50,290
You make it sound
like the Last Supper!

338
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:59,022
Robin! This is the last supper...

339
00:26:59,023 --> 00:27:01,998
for you, Joseph. You poison people,

340
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:07,241
then keep a record of their
suffering! What? That is revolting!

341
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:10,000
My poison has no taste...

342
00:27:10,001 --> 00:27:15,130
no colour, no odour. It's a beautiful
thing. What's the cure for the poison?

343
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:22,163
There are people out there dying!

344
00:27:22,164 --> 00:27:24,660
Children!

345
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:28,320
It's made from an extract
of the amanita mushroom.

346
00:27:28,321 --> 00:27:31,001
The Angel of Death.

347
00:27:31,002 --> 00:27:34,366
The Devil's Cap.

348
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:38,399
There is no cure!

349
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:45,369
Stop him! Open the gate!

350
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:50,079
Stop him!

351
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,843
It's me!

352
00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:58,046
Stop him!

353
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:07,743
They knew him! He tricked us.

354
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:10,218
Clever. Clever?

355
00:28:10,219 --> 00:28:13,380
He nearly poisoned us.
What about these people?

356
00:28:13,381 --> 00:28:15,858
Belladonna. Bella what?

357
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:18,083
Belladonna.

358
00:28:18,084 --> 00:28:21,282
For mushroom poisoning. Belladonna
is deadly nightshade.

359
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,982
It is a poison. It works.

360
00:28:23,983 --> 00:28:27,346
Woodsman's remedy. A poison
to fight a poison.

361
00:28:37,419 --> 00:28:41,344
Djaq? Djaq?
It's Jess, I think she's going.

362
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:46,480
What's that? It's a hunch.

363
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:51,501
But it could kill her. Whose hunch?

364
00:28:51,502 --> 00:28:54,320
Mine.

365
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:57,227
Here.

366
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:02,221
Trust me. Let me do this.

367
00:29:16,219 --> 00:29:18,983
She's going anyway.
Just try it, just try it.

368
00:29:30,939 --> 00:29:32,224
Jess! No...

369
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:45,260
No.

370
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,542
Jess! It's working! It's working!

371
00:29:58,879 --> 00:30:00,480
I think it is!

372
00:30:00,481 --> 00:30:01,980
It is working.

373
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:09,059
Amazing!

374
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,299
How did you know that?
I know some things.

375
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,082
We have to stop Joseph before he poisons
again. He'll have gone into the castle.

376
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:21,140
We have to find a way to get in
after him. How did Will get in? Will?

377
00:30:21,141 --> 00:30:23,379
He's in the castle.

378
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,061
Didn't you know?

379
00:30:26,062 --> 00:30:27,682
Oh, no...

380
00:30:27,683 --> 00:30:31,420
What's going on?
He's going to kill the Sheriff.

381
00:30:31,421 --> 00:30:37,219
Doesn't he know Prince John would destroy Nottingham?
He knows, but... The man the Sheriff killed...

382
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,709
was Will's father.

383
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:47,619
CLATTERING

384
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:54,923
Roger?

385
00:30:54,924 --> 00:30:56,420
Where's Robin?

386
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:00,764
He couldn't make it.
But he gave me this for you.

387
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:04,839
God Save The King. Yeah.

388
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,329
And the rest of us.

389
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:19,223
HORSES WHINNY

390
00:31:24,979 --> 00:31:27,102
Ah!

391
00:31:27,103 --> 00:31:29,541
Success with
the pitiful of Pitt Street?

392
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:33,540
Oh, yes. Even those who hardly
touched the food are in agony.

393
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:38,621
And those who ate the full dose
have begun to die, as I predicted.

394
00:31:38,622 --> 00:31:40,220
Very good.

395
00:31:40,221 --> 00:31:43,321
Well done, thank you, goodbye.

396
00:31:43,322 --> 00:31:46,623
Pardon? You can go now, back to
wherever it was that you came from.

397
00:31:46,624 --> 00:31:48,460
You'll be paid, don't worry.

398
00:31:48,461 --> 00:31:51,423
But the application
of my invention...

399
00:31:51,424 --> 00:31:55,181
To rid the country of the weak
and the dirty, the parasites.

400
00:31:55,182 --> 00:31:59,500
My dear boy, those are the ones
who do exactly what I tell them to.

401
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:05,858
We need those. No. Your poison will be used on
the King's army when they land on the south coast.

402
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:07,822
But that's not what we agreed.

403
00:32:07,823 --> 00:32:10,543
Yes, yes, I know.

404
00:32:10,544 --> 00:32:13,485
And life is usually so much fairer.

405
00:32:16,139 --> 00:32:17,948
Come to Daddy!

406
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:25,423
Nobody passes. Master Joseph asked
us to bring the body to the castle.

407
00:32:25,424 --> 00:32:27,887
What for? He didn't say.

408
00:32:29,939 --> 00:32:31,349
What, d'you want to take it?

409
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:43,703
KNOCKING
Enter!

410
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:47,782
I will not let you use my poison!

411
00:32:49,979 --> 00:32:52,544
Well, I'm surprised
to hear you say that.

412
00:32:52,545 --> 00:32:59,979
A clue... Luckily, I managed to
commandeer your meticulous records.

413
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,779
You used me. Yes, I used you.

414
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:09,863
Don't fuss about it. I like you.

415
00:33:09,864 --> 00:33:17,022
If I didn't, well I could make
you drink from your own cup,

416
00:33:17,023 --> 00:33:20,466
so to speak. So, chin chin.

417
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:28,422
Ermmm... You, you... boy,
don't I know you?

418
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,659
You knew my dad, Dan.

419
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,479
He's dead now. Oh, really?

420
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:39,099
Well, here's to your dearly
departed dead dad Dan.

421
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:45,105
Come along, Joey boy, drink up.

422
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:51,383
And then get lost -
otherwise I might change my mind.

423
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:54,099
To dead Dan!

424
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:59,660
HE GASPS FOR BREATH

425
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:08,500
Raise the gate!
Body for Master Joseph!

426
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:23,038
What's happening?

427
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:25,763
Will's in here.

428
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:27,802
And he wants to kill the Sheriff.

429
00:34:27,803 --> 00:34:30,029
And the Sheriff has hired
a poisoner.

430
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:37,790
Did you see Roger of Stoke? Yeah. I
gave him your letter. Good. Good work.

431
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,478
John, Allan, you go down that way.

432
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:47,619
What do we do if he doesn't
come quietly? Make him.

433
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:54,441
What if he won't? Whatever it takes,
Much. Whatever it takes?

434
00:34:54,442 --> 00:34:58,125
Whatever it takes.
We kill one of our own?

435
00:35:03,759 --> 00:35:05,488
Well, let's hope we have a choice.

436
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:16,521
THUMPING

437
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:20,243
Help...

438
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:27,323
Will. Robin... Help...
We were poisoned...

439
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:33,941
Well, according to your friend here,
there is no cure.

440
00:35:33,942 --> 00:35:36,440
So you're going to die.

441
00:35:36,441 --> 00:35:38,679
No! I cannot die!

442
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:44,367
I am too young. Argh!
I haven't finished yet.

443
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:55,962
Dan Scarlett hadn't finished either when you
killed him this morning. Him! Dead Dan!? The father?

444
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:02,482
I'm going to die because of a complete
nonentity? And life is usually so much fairer.

445
00:36:02,483 --> 00:36:04,162
Argh!

446
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:08,000
Why, Sheriff? Operation Shah Mat.

447
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:14,279
The King's Army. You should approve.
We win without any bloodshed!

448
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:19,944
Well, you're not winning now,
are you?

449
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:27,602
Lf, by the slightest chance...
I happened to have a cure

450
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:31,760
would you give up Shah Mat?
No. No! And there is no cure!

451
00:36:31,761 --> 00:36:35,542
SHUT UP! Yes. Yes! Yes, Robin.
Yes, yes!

452
00:36:35,543 --> 00:36:38,519
Well, don't die before I get back.
No...

453
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:48,921
Will! Tell me you haven't
done anything stupid. Stupid?

454
00:36:48,922 --> 00:36:51,819
To the Sheriff.
I haven't touched him.

455
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,958
It's not pestilence, it's a poison.
And we have a cure!

456
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:56,582
It's Little John's idea!

457
00:36:56,583 --> 00:37:02,880
That's good. You're not happy?
The sick are getting better!

458
00:37:02,881 --> 00:37:04,943
What are you doing?

459
00:37:04,944 --> 00:37:07,062
My dad isn't getting better!

460
00:37:07,063 --> 00:37:08,321
Don't do this...

461
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,247
Whoa, whoa!
Where's Djaq? We split up.

462
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:21,698
Will has poisoned the Sheriff. What?

463
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:24,270
And Djaq's got the remedy. Will!

464
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:31,518
I know what you've done. I've done
the right thing, that's what I've done.

465
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:37,399
Justice in a bottle. Djaq has the remedy.
I know. She told me. Where is she, Will?

466
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,842
What have you done with her?
I've stood up to the Sheriff.

467
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:43,898
That's what we all should
have done a long time ago.

468
00:37:43,899 --> 00:37:48,962
Even if all of Nottingham dies?
That's not my fault.

469
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:53,224
No, Master no! Robin!

470
00:37:53,225 --> 00:37:59,882
Robin! You want to watch people die, you can
start with me. Robin! I can't let the Sheriff live.

471
00:37:59,883 --> 00:38:05,839
Yes, you can! My dad. He did it for me. He
stood up to the Sheriff to prove himself to me!

472
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,946
Then prove yourself to him. Show that
we are stronger men than the Sheriff.

473
00:38:11,919 --> 00:38:13,728
ROBIN GASPS

474
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:16,161
Will!

475
00:38:16,162 --> 00:38:19,043
Will, come on!
Robin, why did you have to do this?

476
00:38:19,044 --> 00:38:20,643
To prove my point.

477
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:26,126
Will Scarlett still believes
in the right thing. Will, please...

478
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:30,803
Will, do this.

479
00:38:30,804 --> 00:38:33,165
I'll take you to her.

480
00:38:34,919 --> 00:38:38,400
Go, go to the Sheriff's
quarters, go. I'll see you there.

481
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:58,920
Who's that? What are you doing?
Come on!

482
00:39:06,259 --> 00:39:09,319
Oooo! Nothing like the taste of
your own medicine, is there?

483
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:20,168
And you...
have an announcement to make.

484
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,700
People of Nottingham!

485
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:33,203
There is no pestilence.

486
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:41,261
An experiment for which I'm...

487
00:39:41,262 --> 00:39:43,419
truly, truly sorry.

488
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,420
Shah Mat... I can't,

489
00:39:46,421 --> 00:39:50,241
I'm too weak. Robin!
Djaq, the remedy. Quick.

490
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:53,983
Will, this is your call.

491
00:39:53,984 --> 00:39:57,210
Prove to me Will Scarlett
believes in doing the right thing.

492
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:01,421
You didn't drink
the poison, did you? No.

493
00:40:01,422 --> 00:40:04,183
But I think my point
still stands so...

494
00:40:06,419 --> 00:40:09,149
Yes, yes, it does.

495
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:17,183
This is to the memory of
my good father, Dan Scarlett

496
00:40:17,184 --> 00:40:19,784
and the people of Nottingham.

497
00:40:27,979 --> 00:40:29,128
He can't be dead.

498
00:40:32,619 --> 00:40:36,301
This is getting weird now. I want him
to live and I don't want him to live.

499
00:40:36,302 --> 00:40:38,060
Come on!

500
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,703
Just joshing.

501
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:41,140
Finish the speech.

502
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:44,422
Oh, I don't think so.
I've had the remedy. Guards!

503
00:40:44,423 --> 00:40:46,861
Guards! Go, go! Robin Hood!

504
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:47,905
Kill him!

505
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:55,502
Then he looked and saw the angel of
death standing between heaven and earth.

506
00:40:55,503 --> 00:40:58,942
Joseph, there's a cure.
I can give you the antidote.

507
00:40:58,943 --> 00:41:03,739
I was going to be remembered for a thousand
years. The creator of the perfect poison.

508
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:08,502
There cannot be an antidote. There is an
antidote. And any woodsman would know it.

509
00:41:08,503 --> 00:41:11,150
No... No!

510
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:22,619
Good.

511
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,859
Give me your hand.

512
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,740
SCREAMING

513
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:36,269
THUD!

514
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:46,539
Get him!

515
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:01,707
Stop him!

516
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,579
CHEERING

517
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:24,840
It's good to have you back, Lukey.

518
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:27,600
- Are you ready for this?
- What's he doing up there?

519
00:42:27,601 --> 00:42:31,883
I thought you said Will was gonna build
something to remind you of your father.

520
00:42:31,884 --> 00:42:35,781
He is. Wait for the light. Light?

521
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:38,388
It is light.

522
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:46,267
Any second...

523
00:42:47,759 --> 00:42:49,044
Now.

524
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:03,519
Dan...

525
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:06,947
That is...

526
00:43:11,499 --> 00:43:13,000
Beautiful.

527
00:43:17,879 --> 00:43:18,921
He was a good man.

528
00:43:18,922 --> 00:43:20,643
Yep.

529
00:43:20,644 --> 00:43:22,345
He was.

530
00:43:26,879 --> 00:43:28,959
He's been tipped off. By who?

531
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,800
Henry of Lewes. Why did you
let the messenger through?

532
00:43:31,801 --> 00:43:34,720
I think I have a spy in my gang.
Bring her medicines.

533
00:43:34,721 --> 00:43:37,981
The Sheriff wants your services. If
she lays one finger on my patient...

534
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:40,719
I can't let him live
to speak his treason.

535
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,800
The Sheriff knows she helped.
They're having her ducked as a witch!

536
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:46,165
We need to know who the traitor is.
Tell us, Robin!
