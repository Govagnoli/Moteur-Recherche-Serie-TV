1
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,954
We are ready.

2
00:00:19,315 --> 00:00:21,862
Forgive our excitement
but we've been waiting months for this.

3
00:00:21,932 --> 00:00:22,920
I'm intrigued.

4
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:24,947
You'll be astonished, I assure you.

5
00:00:25,298 --> 00:00:28,196
Right, what you are about to see here today

6
00:00:28,265 --> 00:00:30,898
demonstrates that by containing
the black powder,

7
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:33,096
we can control the charge.

8
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:36,763
Guy's miners would then be able
to place a small charge at the scene,

9
00:00:36,764 --> 00:00:41,917
let the powder do the hard work, and increase
production without endangering lives.

10
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:45,821
Please dismount, my lord.
There may be quite a bang.

11
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,846
- Really?
- Your horse is highly strung.

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,358
It won't be the only highly-strung creature
if I'm made to hang around for much longer.

13
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,319
Well done, my friend.

14
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,757
Well done, Gisborne!

15
00:01:43,992 --> 00:01:47,519
Get me 10 or 20 large, huge crates !

16
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:50,405
If I'm to create more black powder,
there are conditions.

17
00:01:50,406 --> 00:01:52,434
- Really?
- One.

18
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:54,751
I'm allowed to sell my discovery
to other concerns.

19
00:01:54,752 --> 00:01:57,837
- Naturally.
- Two. I get a bonus for me work.

20
00:01:57,838 --> 00:01:59,821
- Of course.
- And finally...

21
00:02:00,814 --> 00:02:02,957
this powder must never be used as a weapon.

22
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:11,060
I think you and I have a future.

23
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:12,805
Trust me.

24
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:18,551
- No.
- Lambert!

25
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:22,966
- I think not.
- Think about what you're doing.

26
00:02:23,395 --> 00:02:26,412
- I cannot trust you.
- My dear boy.

27
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:31,417
- Let me go or there will be trouble.
- I adore trouble.

28
00:02:35,882 --> 00:02:37,015
Get him!

29
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:40,437
Alive!

30
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:43,999
Lambert!

31
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,437
Don't go! Stop, we can help you!

32
00:02:56,438 --> 00:02:58,326
Back off ! No!

EPISODE 9
"A THING OR TWO ABOUT LOYALTY"

35
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:46,322
- Stand still.
- Back off.

36
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,068
No point struggling.

37
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:51,097
It was a mistake to run, Lambert.

38
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:54,936
- You'll not renege on our deal.
- There can be no deal.

39
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:56,542
You lied to me, Guy.

40
00:03:56,646 --> 00:03:58,424
You force me to do this. Search him.

41
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:02,343
You promised me
you would not use it as a weapon.

42
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:06,053
- Please!
- Where is the ledger, with the formula?

43
00:04:06,605 --> 00:04:09,323
That information belongs to both of us.
I commissioned you.

44
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:11,306
And that is where your input ends.

45
00:04:11,307 --> 00:04:16,023
Black powder is not a toy, Guy. It is lethal.
And I will not let you abuse its power.

46
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:18,248
- Where is it?
- Somewhere you'll never find it.

47
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,483
Your friend seems to enjoy
the power he has over us, very clever.

48
00:04:22,484 --> 00:04:26,506
Congratulations, you just made yourself the
most important man in Nottingham, Lambert.

49
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:29,174
So when we hurt you,
we'll do it very carefully.

50
00:04:33,178 --> 00:04:35,319
- He's done for.
- We're done for...

51
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,246
if the Sheriff gets the ledger.

52
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:40,741
Few of those,
you could take out a whole town.

53
00:04:40,742 --> 00:04:42,729
"Hello, villagers, can't pay your taxes?

54
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,253
- "Boom, you're out!"
- It's not funny.

55
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:47,495
- Punched me to the ground.
- What was that?

56
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,213
Greek fire.

57
00:04:49,393 --> 00:04:52,641
When we were in the Holy Land,
we heard tales of boats being destroyed.

58
00:04:52,642 --> 00:04:54,768
- Sunken without a trace.
- Typical.

59
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:58,719
Our alchemists have been experimenting
with it for years and its called Greek.

60
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,244
Never Saracen, Greek.

61
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:02,221
- It's amazing.
- Not it's not, it's evil.

62
00:05:02,222 --> 00:05:05,550
It doesn't require any courage
or strength or wit to use it.

63
00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:08,382
Right. Plan is...

64
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:11,907
somebody needs to get arrested
and taken to the dungeons.

65
00:05:11,908 --> 00:05:15,499
I'm not being funny but isn't getting arrested
what we normally try and avoid?

66
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,793
Well, that's the quickest way in.
Why, are you volunteering?

67
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:20,065
No.

68
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:23,972
What?

69
00:05:27,856 --> 00:05:30,573
What? Oi!

70
00:05:30,574 --> 00:05:31,879
I'm being serious.

71
00:05:31,937 --> 00:05:34,250
NOTTINGHAM TOWN

72
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:37,348
Prince John,
in the absence of good King Richard,

73
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,004
has turned this country into a state of terror.

74
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:43,337
His followers are thugs.

75
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,032
Our taxes are too high.

76
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,387
People are starving.

77
00:05:50,406 --> 00:05:52,580
What does one have to do to get arrested?

78
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:58,244
Arrest me!

79
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:04,754
Thank you!

80
00:06:16,487 --> 00:06:17,305
Hello!

81
00:06:19,802 --> 00:06:21,445
I'm a friend of Robin Hood.

82
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:24,076
And this...

83
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,312
is a rescue.

84
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,977
Gisborne.

85
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,246
Take this runt to the Great Hall.

86
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:46,885
Lambert, help me to help you.
I cannot hold the Sheriff much longer.

87
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:54,010
Lambert should be
at the screaming stage right now,

88
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:55,982
but all I hear is nothing.

89
00:06:56,022 --> 00:06:59,848
- I'm determined to reason with him, my lord.
- Oh, really?

90
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,317
And is it working?

91
00:07:01,695 --> 00:07:02,783
Reason?

92
00:07:03,752 --> 00:07:06,014
You going soft, Gisborne, hm?

93
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:09,279
Because he's your friend. Is that it? Well!

94
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:12,725
- Leave him with me. I'll reason with him.
- I can handle him.

95
00:07:12,726 --> 00:07:15,361
No, you've failed me. You're off the project.

96
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:18,245
Now, what is this creature doing here?

97
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:20,474
This is one of Robin Hood's inner circle.

98
00:07:20,486 --> 00:07:23,862
- This is his right-hand man.
- Oh, bravo!

99
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:26,184
He can tell us all we need to know
about the outlaws.

100
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:28,117
Like what, hm?

101
00:07:28,463 --> 00:07:30,480
That Robin Hood is against us?

102
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:33,086
That he keeps moving his camp on, hm?

103
00:07:33,109 --> 00:07:36,612
- There 's nothing to know.
- All right, so hang him then, make an example.

104
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:38,483
Brilliant!

105
00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:40,983
A clue - no.

106
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:45,977
Hang him and you have an instant martyr.

107
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:48,916
Suddenly, everybody loves Robin Hood.

108
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:51,221
What would you suggest we do with him, then?

109
00:07:51,883 --> 00:07:54,501
I'll make a real example of this man.

110
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:02,639
Does anyone fancy a wager?

111
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:05,917
Yeah? Who thinks he'll get out on his own?

112
00:08:08,394 --> 00:08:10,937
Trust me, Allan. Much can do it.

113
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,211
We talking about the same Much?

114
00:08:13,783 --> 00:08:15,476
I will not poison myself.

115
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:17,989
You will have to kill me first.

116
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:20,739
Poison yourself?

117
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,736
This...

118
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:27,744
is Burgundy wine.

119
00:08:28,023 --> 00:08:32,578
And this... is the very best venison, hmm?

120
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,648
Mm, a feast.

121
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:37,881
Although granted,

122
00:08:37,894 --> 00:08:41,466
they make taste like poison
to a peasant's palate.

123
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,954
Hmm, which reminds me.

124
00:08:48,336 --> 00:08:49,966
Gisborne, your sword.

125
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:53,931
We're going to take hearts and minds
to a new level.

126
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,881
Stop him.

127
00:09:01,743 --> 00:09:03,264
Make him kneel.

128
00:09:17,327 --> 00:09:19,361
By the powers vested in me...

129
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:21,397
blah-di-blah-di-blah...

130
00:09:21,536 --> 00:09:24,079
I dub you...

131
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,355
Earl of Bonchurch.

132
00:09:26,425 --> 00:09:29,208
Hm? That's what you were promised, wasn't it?

133
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:31,940
When you came home, hm? Stand!

134
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:39,518
Lord Much!
Well? Do you feel honored?

135
00:09:40,535 --> 00:09:42,431
Have you really just made me an earl?

136
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,245
Well, not quite.

137
00:09:44,246 --> 00:09:49,084
No. I will have a word with Prince John,
and he will make it official.

138
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:53,221
So, you will have all the privileges
and luxuries of a lord.

139
00:09:53,222 --> 00:09:55,360
You will take your seat in the
lodge at Bonchurch.

140
00:09:55,361 --> 00:10:00,449
Oh, and I expect you
at the Council of Nobles tomorrow.

141
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:19,446
You're an intelligent young man.

142
00:10:19,447 --> 00:10:21,423
What would you do if you were me? Hm?

143
00:10:22,704 --> 00:10:26,775
I have a little of your very exciting black powder
and I want some more.

144
00:10:27,518 --> 00:10:29,978
But you won't give me any more...

145
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:35,444
- I'll not allow you to use this as a weapon.
- But, if I ask you nicely,

146
00:10:35,445 --> 00:10:39,241
will you give me your ledger
with the formula, please?

147
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:43,710
Well, there 'll be no nicey nicey now.

148
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:46,934
Have fun.

149
00:10:47,153 --> 00:10:50,159
Show him the instruments of torture.

150
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:52,068
Guy!

151
00:10:55,469 --> 00:10:58,070
Don't take it so personally, Gisborne.

152
00:10:58,382 --> 00:11:00,837
Consider, if you will,
the effect on the peasants.

153
00:11:00,838 --> 00:11:02,698
"Oh, look, one of us has been made a noble.

154
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:05,843
"If we work hard, keep our heads bowed,
good little boys and girls,

155
00:11:05,844 --> 00:11:08,005
"maybe we'll get rewarded too."

156
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:11,976
You see, our point of view
is that of money and power.

157
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:15,829
Give him money and power,
he sees the world from our point of view.

158
00:11:16,775 --> 00:11:19,467
Oh, and, um, just between you and me.

159
00:11:19,686 --> 00:11:22,669
I've a certain person in place
who'll keep him on track -

160
00:11:23,077 --> 00:11:25,875
loyal, trustworthy.

161
00:11:25,876 --> 00:11:28,035
If you'll excuse me, my lord.

162
00:11:35,582 --> 00:11:37,239
Guy!

163
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:39,071
You are upset.

164
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,519
I'm fine. I cannot discuss it.

165
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:46,168
I had not imagined the man who wishes
to marry me would shut me out of his thoughts.

166
00:11:47,522 --> 00:11:49,706
Forgive me, Marian. I'm not myself.

167
00:11:50,928 --> 00:11:53,005
Has the Sheriff angered you?

168
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,940
No, the Sheriff undermines me
whenever possible. That's not unusual.

169
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:59,861
Is this about Lambert and finding the ledger?

170
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:03,057
This black powder is costing you a dear friend.

171
00:12:04,814 --> 00:12:10,098
I am angry because the Greek fire was my
project and the Sheriff took it away from me.

172
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:14,496
Suppose we were to take matters
into our own hands.

173
00:12:14,554 --> 00:12:19,825
Surely the Sheriff would not mind how you went
about it. He strikes me as an endgame man.

174
00:12:20,068 --> 00:12:23,085
- If you could find the ledger...
- What would you suggest?

175
00:12:24,468 --> 00:12:26,597
Show Lambert you are still his friend.

176
00:12:26,675 --> 00:12:28,814
Take him to a place of safety.

177
00:12:28,826 --> 00:12:32,165
- You always say people respond to loyalty.
- No.

178
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:34,292
Lambert would never trust me now.

179
00:12:34,293 --> 00:12:38,535
I think he would if you proved
beyond all doubt that you could protect him.

180
00:12:38,581 --> 00:12:41,726
- How?
- Take him to Kirklees.

181
00:12:42,003 --> 00:12:46,379
Perhaps tomorrow, there is a Council of Nobles
so the Sheriff will be busy.

182
00:12:46,457 --> 00:12:48,446
Regain Lambert's trust.

183
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,449
You and he are old friends.

184
00:12:51,524 --> 00:12:53,422
Build on that friendship.

185
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,381
Very well.

186
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,979
Lepers, Gisborne.

187
00:12:59,057 --> 00:13:01,250
Lepers.

188
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:09,858
He should be here by now.

189
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:12,805
John, head for the sewer entrance and join Will.

190
00:13:12,806 --> 00:13:16,483
Djaq, gather some horses
by the east gate and go and get...

191
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:21,713
All bets are off.

192
00:13:23,723 --> 00:13:27,086
- Robin, what is going on?
- Let's follow.

193
00:13:27,594 --> 00:13:30,299
BONCHURCH LODGE

194
00:13:35,922 --> 00:13:38,980
- Why isn't Much running away?
- Maybe he cannot.

195
00:13:39,107 --> 00:13:41,835
Whatever the Sheriff has planned,
it will include us.

196
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:44,454
But Much is safe
as long as we are not seen.

197
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:46,487
Lambert might've already given in.

198
00:13:46,488 --> 00:13:47,954
I know.

199
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:49,988
I need to get into the castle.

200
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:51,660
Well, I've got a lovely idea.

201
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:06,739
My lord.

202
00:14:07,433 --> 00:14:08,427
Welcome!

203
00:14:08,855 --> 00:14:11,615
The wealth and bounties of Bonchurch
are yours.

204
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:21,276
I'm not here for a confrontation, Lambert.
I'm here to help you.

205
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:25,718
Get me out of here, Guy.

206
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:28,156
- They'll break me.
- You reconsidered?

207
00:14:28,157 --> 00:14:29,681
No.

208
00:14:29,857 --> 00:14:31,891
I want to help people, not harm them.

209
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:34,485
But we can help people.

210
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:36,678
Don't you see?

211
00:14:36,753 --> 00:14:40,297
This is the perfect weapon of war
for our troops in the Holy Land.

212
00:14:40,805 --> 00:14:43,686
It would help to save lives.

213
00:14:43,823 --> 00:14:45,642
You're so naive.

214
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:50,280
I will die in here and all because
I have not toed the line.

215
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:52,342
Then so be it.

216
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:58,231
I have a plan to get you to safety,
if you give me the ledger.

217
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:08,671
You are surely a spy
and this is a trap... of sorts.

218
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:10,352
I beg to differ, my lord.

219
00:15:10,353 --> 00:15:14,209
I'm just Eve, your servant here,
and I'll do my best to please you.

220
00:15:15,852 --> 00:15:20,413
This is a lovely place and it's warm here,
especially at night.

221
00:15:25,788 --> 00:15:28,518
Yes, we'll see.

222
00:15:30,911 --> 00:15:36,530
I mean, I must say it is very pleasant,
as, um... as traps go.

223
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,741
Will there be anything else, my lord?

224
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,920
Yes.

225
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,476
How does the Council of Nobles work nowadays?

226
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:58,684
Meat dip.

227
00:15:59,273 --> 00:16:00,907
Nice one, Allan.

228
00:16:34,372 --> 00:16:36,083
Do you remember me?

229
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,031
I'm going to get you out of here.

230
00:16:39,274 --> 00:16:40,673
No, you're not.

231
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:42,475
They've broken both my legs.

232
00:16:43,758 --> 00:16:45,539
A detail... All right...

233
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:51,793
We need to get you out some way.

234
00:16:52,832 --> 00:16:54,982
- You can't.
- I'm not giving you a choice.

235
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:57,826
You are the only one
who knows how to make Greek fire.

236
00:16:58,196 --> 00:16:59,807
And that is the joke.

237
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:04,694
There have been so many variations
in ingredients, amount...

238
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:08,057
I can't remember everything,
so I record it all in my ledger.

239
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:09,904
Where is it?

240
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:13,640
And I should tell you?

241
00:17:13,976 --> 00:17:15,120
You're an outlaw.

242
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:18,246
But it would be catastrophic
in the hands of the Sheriff.

243
00:17:18,692 --> 00:17:20,345
Now, how much did you make for him?

244
00:17:20,426 --> 00:17:24,637
There are three barrels of the mixture
and the Sheriff has confiscated them.

245
00:17:24,888 --> 00:17:26,681
In the castle?

246
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:29,073
I don't know.

247
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:33,242
The Sheriff will torture you again.

248
00:17:33,605 --> 00:17:36,001
- Yes.
- And you'll break.

249
00:17:36,752 --> 00:17:38,417
Everybody breaks,

250
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,307
and then the Sheriff will have
the ledger and the Greek fire.

251
00:17:41,585 --> 00:17:44,290
Now, I can hide it for you in another place,

252
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:47,272
and you can honestly tell the Sheriff
you do not know where it is,

253
00:17:47,273 --> 00:17:50,002
and I will gather my men
and I will come back and rescue you.

254
00:17:50,187 --> 00:17:53,759
And what's to stop you from using
the Greek fire for your own ends?

255
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:54,880
Nothing.

256
00:17:55,793 --> 00:17:59,815
Other than I am Robin Hood,
and I offer you my word.

257
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,703
When you wake up, you tell the Sheriff,
Lambert no longer knows where the ledger is.

258
00:18:19,704 --> 00:18:21,485
- Robin Hood knows.
- But I'm not asleep.

259
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:25,542
You are now.

260
00:18:28,454 --> 00:18:30,165
Lady Marian.

261
00:18:31,564 --> 00:18:34,894
I have come to pay my respects
to the new Earl of Bonchurch.

262
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,005
- Lady Marian.
- Lord Much.

263
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:46,820
Perhaps you might call on us soon at Knighton
with our mutual friend.

264
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:52,622
I do not think that that would be possible.
Robin hasn't come yet.

265
00:18:53,824 --> 00:18:56,969
Well, then I shall call again
when it is more convenient.

266
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:01,903
This is for him.

267
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:12,866
I think I will find it, um...

268
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:14,635
useful,

269
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:16,888
being on the Council of Nobles.

270
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,276
I will have your best robes ready for tomorrow.

271
00:19:22,255 --> 00:19:26,937
There is something particular, which I think
will make your first evening at home...

272
00:19:27,561 --> 00:19:28,555
complete.

273
00:19:29,214 --> 00:19:30,744
Come upstairs.

274
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:41,905
The ledger is in the fourth water butt.

275
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:43,602
That's this one.

276
00:19:47,634 --> 00:19:48,906
Guards!

277
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,149
I'm not being funny. It's soaking wet.

278
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,901
- It'll be ruined.
- Let me see.

279
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:22,068
No, it's still good. This is it. I knew it.

280
00:20:22,404 --> 00:20:23,316
We know Greek fire.

281
00:20:23,317 --> 00:20:26,982
We are keeping Lambert's ledger safe.

282
00:20:27,063 --> 00:20:29,039
Guards are coming back. Come on!

283
00:21:20,218 --> 00:21:24,691
- You sit back and relax, Much.
- I am trying to complete my mission, master.

284
00:21:24,692 --> 00:21:28,222
Yeah? Because I saw this girl...

285
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:30,488
- Eve.
- Mm, Eve.

286
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:32,949
You do know Eve will be working for the Sheriff?

287
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,152
Well, I'm sure she is.

288
00:21:36,846 --> 00:21:39,216
What happened, Much, hm?

289
00:21:39,505 --> 00:21:42,650
I am made Lord Much,
Earl of Bonchurch, actually.

290
00:21:43,406 --> 00:21:44,851
This is from Marian.

291
00:21:49,048 --> 00:21:51,787
And I was thinking that I could be of help.

292
00:21:51,949 --> 00:21:54,890
There 's a Council of Nobles meeting tomorrow
and they have access to prisoners.

293
00:21:54,891 --> 00:21:57,745
No need. We found a way in.

294
00:21:57,746 --> 00:22:01,260
But we still need to find
the barrels of black powder

295
00:22:01,261 --> 00:22:05,051
and the Sheriff has made a big mistake
making you a noble.

296
00:22:05,398 --> 00:22:06,288
Yeah.

297
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:10,822
Because now we have a noble...
on the inside.

298
00:22:19,096 --> 00:22:21,709
All right. I got your note.

299
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,374
So!

300
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:25,921
- Gisborne's going to help us.
- Yes.

301
00:22:25,922 --> 00:22:28,303
And what on earth did you do
to him to make him agree to that?

302
00:22:28,304 --> 00:22:30,580
Nothing! I played on his conscience.

303
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:33,587
You see, I'd believe you,
if I thought he had one.

304
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:35,368
So go on.

305
00:22:36,058 --> 00:22:37,769
- What did you promise him?
- Stop it.

306
00:22:37,907 --> 00:22:41,837
Lambert is his friend,
and Gisborne feels undermined by the Sheriff,

307
00:22:41,838 --> 00:22:43,236
and I took advantage of the situation.

308
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,255
Clever you!

309
00:22:44,498 --> 00:22:48,070
Well, I cannot see how,
we can get Lambert out any other way.

310
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:52,416
This is the best opportunity
we have at the perfect time.

311
00:22:52,612 --> 00:22:54,624
- Guy thinks...
- Guy thinks!

312
00:22:54,971 --> 00:22:56,538
So what is this plan?

313
00:22:56,827 --> 00:22:59,836
Guy will not attend
the Council of Nobles in the morning.

314
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:03,161
He will use the Sheriff's absence
to secure Lambert's release,

315
00:23:03,162 --> 00:23:05,528
and then take him on to Kirklees
where it is safe.

316
00:23:05,936 --> 00:23:10,402
If you wait on the Great North Road, you can
intercept them and seize Lambert yourself.

317
00:23:10,403 --> 00:23:13,477
And for heaven's sake,
find that ledger and burn it.

318
00:23:13,478 --> 00:23:17,161
I already have the ledger,
and I'm not going to burn it.

319
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,618
I'm keeping it safe for Lambert.

320
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:21,208
At the risk of the Sheriff getting hold of it?

321
00:23:21,612 --> 00:23:24,433
And what then?
It is too dangerous.

322
00:23:24,434 --> 00:23:27,172
How is it our calling to judge
what should or shouldn't exist as knowledge?

323
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:30,014
It is our calling to protect others.

324
00:23:30,107 --> 00:23:33,864
If it is glory you seek by keeping the ledger,
then God help you.

325
00:23:38,061 --> 00:23:40,149
What's the matter, hm?

326
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:42,730
Marian getting you down?

327
00:23:43,316 --> 00:23:45,143
I'm tired, my lord.

328
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:47,015
You're, um...

329
00:23:47,016 --> 00:23:51,113
You're probably wondering
where your loyalties lie.

330
00:23:51,114 --> 00:23:53,380
Well, let me tell you where they do lie.

331
00:23:53,681 --> 00:23:56,282
Your friend, Lambert.

332
00:23:57,345 --> 00:23:59,374
He has slighted your loyalty.

333
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:05,131
You do know that he told Robin Hood
where the ledgers were?

334
00:24:05,258 --> 00:24:10,483
The information he kept from you,
he gave to your enemy.

335
00:24:12,645 --> 00:24:16,619
Now, what friend would act so callously

336
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:21,626
when your every effort has been
to protect him, hm?

337
00:24:23,707 --> 00:24:25,456
Take heart.

338
00:24:25,457 --> 00:24:27,725
Look at the bigger picture, hm?

339
00:24:28,243 --> 00:24:30,625
Your black powder will open
so many doors for us, Gisborne.

340
00:24:30,683 --> 00:24:32,914
It is power beyond imagination.

341
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:41,019
And take heed, the sorry state of affairs
has in no way affected my judgment of you.

342
00:24:41,157 --> 00:24:43,130
Trust.

343
00:24:43,362 --> 00:24:47,565
When all others around us falter,
that is, that they...

344
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:54,684
We make a fine team,
my friend, a fine team.

345
00:24:56,753 --> 00:24:58,897
Let's build on it, shall we?

346
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:04,233
So...

347
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,894
I'll go and pay our friend a visit.

348
00:25:08,895 --> 00:25:12,756
Shall I teach him a thing or two about loyalty?

349
00:25:13,103 --> 00:25:14,526
Yes.

350
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,428
It's play...

351
00:25:18,085 --> 00:25:20,004
or pay.

352
00:25:23,912 --> 00:25:27,137
Now, Robin Hood tells me
that you told him where the ledger is.

353
00:25:27,138 --> 00:25:28,953
Why did you tell him and didn't tell me?

354
00:25:28,976 --> 00:25:31,981
So that you would realize I could
tell you no more.

355
00:25:31,982 --> 00:25:34,653
Oh, to protect you!

356
00:25:39,894 --> 00:25:42,359
You know, sometimes I think
he doesn't understand me at all.

357
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,028
What are you doing here?

358
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,999
I could not pursue our project, forgive me.

359
00:26:03,739 --> 00:26:05,276
Loyalty.

360
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:07,761
Loyalties are sometimes divided.

361
00:26:08,941 --> 00:26:10,630
Lambert's dead.

362
00:26:18,091 --> 00:26:21,728
My lords, ladies, nobles.

363
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:26,141
Let me introduce the latest addition
to your well-fed sirs,

364
00:26:26,257 --> 00:26:29,228
Lord Much, Earl of Bonchurch.

365
00:26:40,395 --> 00:26:43,516
You know, I have heard that
there was once a Roman emperor,

366
00:26:43,517 --> 00:26:45,898
who made his horse a senator.

367
00:26:48,696 --> 00:26:52,464
Can you imagine that, hm?
All the other senators smiling

368
00:26:52,465 --> 00:26:54,441
as their latest member drops dung on their feet.

369
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,824
You're not going to that,
are you, Lord Much, eh?

370
00:27:02,442 --> 00:27:04,789
So, down to business, hm?

371
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,238
Oh, boring, boring. Oh!

372
00:27:09,423 --> 00:27:13,757
Oh! I see the proposed new plough tax

373
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:16,267
will be phased in
at the beginning of next month.

374
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:18,556
Well, I suggest a...

375
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:21,430
I don't know, increase three-fold. Lonsdale.

376
00:27:21,488 --> 00:27:23,059
But, wait, wait.

377
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,550
Why don't we seek the wise counsel
of our newest member on the matter?

378
00:27:26,551 --> 00:27:27,020
What do you think?

379
00:27:33,841 --> 00:27:38,037
- The plough tax, my lord...
- Come along. Come along! Eh?

380
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:40,985
Should it be "yea" or should it be "nay?"

381
00:27:41,136 --> 00:27:44,050
To an increase in the plough tax, I say "nay."

382
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:45,898
Nay! I knew he would say nay!

383
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:48,560
Eh? Neigh, horsey, horsey, horsey.

384
00:27:48,628 --> 00:27:50,077
Neigh! Neigh!

385
00:27:50,928 --> 00:27:53,070
I have to say that...

386
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:56,019
- I say...
- What? You have to say what?

387
00:27:56,343 --> 00:28:00,479
Well, let this serve as a reminder
about what "nay" means.

388
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:02,054
To me, dissent.

389
00:28:02,525 --> 00:28:06,722
Neigh means horses and horses have to be
ridden hard. They have to be whipped.

390
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,716
Loughborough. Hm?

391
00:28:10,653 --> 00:28:11,817
Marian!

392
00:28:12,966 --> 00:28:14,390
Lady Marian!

393
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:19,919
How's your father, hm? Is he still poorly?

394
00:28:20,312 --> 00:28:24,000
Well, you will remind him about
my position on "naying", won't you?

395
00:28:54,697 --> 00:28:56,003
He's dead.

396
00:28:57,483 --> 00:28:59,309
I'm so sorry.

397
00:29:19,775 --> 00:29:21,833
- I'm burning this.
- Will, no! Stop it!

398
00:29:23,614 --> 00:29:26,849
- Steady.
- This is not science. This is murder.

399
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,650
Think of this as progress.

400
00:29:29,754 --> 00:29:33,718
Other scientists could do
much better things with Greek fire.

401
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:37,048
Yeah, you could blow up
the entire castle with that stuff.

402
00:29:37,453 --> 00:29:38,794
Lambert's dead.

403
00:29:40,135 --> 00:29:42,203
He died believing I'd protect his work.

404
00:29:42,204 --> 00:29:45,637
Then let me study this ledger,
create black powder.

405
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:48,584
With this, we could be unstoppable.

406
00:29:48,585 --> 00:29:51,787
This is not about one man's wish. Robin!

407
00:29:56,765 --> 00:29:59,089
First, we need to destroy the Sheriff's powder.

408
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:01,413
That is a weapon he must not wield.

409
00:30:01,748 --> 00:30:04,153
It's time to call on our noble on the inside.

410
00:30:04,504 --> 00:30:09,833
I couldn't save you from the plough tax,
but tonight no one shall go hungry.

411
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:16,488
- Thank you for all this.
- My pleasure.

412
00:30:22,565 --> 00:30:23,952
Thank you!

413
00:30:30,064 --> 00:30:32,202
It is my mother. She thanks you.

414
00:30:32,376 --> 00:30:35,139
Tell her she can come here
and eat whenever she wants.

415
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,690
I make sure she wants for nothing
but I've never seen her so happy.

416
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:40,632
Everyone is happy here.

417
00:30:40,725 --> 00:30:43,869
And you've made that happen, my lord.

418
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,274
Please, don't call me "my lord".

419
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,790
We are friends now.

420
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,611
And while I'm here, and while I have food,
then so should everyone.

421
00:30:52,715 --> 00:30:54,149
That is Robin Hood's way.

422
00:30:55,224 --> 00:30:56,692
Lady Marian?

423
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,945
I should like to speak with you
in private, Lord Much.

424
00:31:04,957 --> 00:31:06,668
Of course.

425
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:20,263
Look, we need you to tell the girl that the
ledger is in the third barrel of black powder.

426
00:31:20,494 --> 00:31:23,999
But that's not true.
Robin has the ledger. He told me himself.

427
00:31:24,034 --> 00:31:25,545
What is the problem?

428
00:31:26,195 --> 00:31:28,022
I will not lie to Eve.

429
00:31:28,866 --> 00:31:30,416
- I cannot.
- Why?

430
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,791
Oh, of course, you are fooled by her.

431
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:36,906
She has to be nice to you.
She is paid for it. Grow up.

432
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:40,274
If she passes the wrong information
to the Sheriff, he will punish her.

433
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:43,478
If she's working for the Sheriff,
then she deserves no less.

434
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,229
A good man has already died over this.

435
00:31:50,684 --> 00:31:54,904
Just do as Robin says, and tell the girl.

436
00:31:58,568 --> 00:32:02,645
# The stars above know more than we

437
00:32:02,946 --> 00:32:07,593
# For they can see the hearts, the souls

438
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:14,087
# The loves that cannot be #

439
00:32:16,272 --> 00:32:17,948
That is a sad song.

440
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:20,099
I'm sorry, my lord. I'll sing...

441
00:32:20,156 --> 00:32:22,552
Tell me, why is it so sad?

442
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:25,177
My father would sing that song.

443
00:32:26,668 --> 00:32:28,217
He died last year.

444
00:32:29,396 --> 00:32:32,638
That annoys you, talk of the past.

445
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:36,233
I...

446
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,868
I don't know how to be around you.

447
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,706
You could have a bath.

448
00:32:50,228 --> 00:32:54,771
No! Wear a bath shirt
and pour yourself a bath.

449
00:32:59,512 --> 00:33:07,994
"For they will see the hearts,
the souls, the loves that cannot..."

450
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,657
You have a terrible voice.

451
00:33:11,385 --> 00:33:13,651
Well, it has been said by many,

452
00:33:14,044 --> 00:33:18,148
most of them fools, and now by you, so...

453
00:33:18,767 --> 00:33:20,316
so it must be true.

454
00:33:20,535 --> 00:33:24,801
- It is terrible.
- Ha, flattery...

455
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:27,044
again.

456
00:33:29,414 --> 00:33:30,882
And now I've upset you.

457
00:33:32,989 --> 00:33:38,017
When I was in the Holy Land,
I would find myself craving something.

458
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:39,186
I thought...

459
00:33:39,637 --> 00:33:45,235
I thought it was hunger,
and it was hunger most of the time.

460
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,408
But, now and then,

461
00:33:47,477 --> 00:33:52,553
when I would feel it,
it would not be in the stomach,

462
00:33:54,645 --> 00:33:56,390
but in the heart.

463
00:33:57,882 --> 00:34:00,009
Your song's bit sad too, isn't it?

464
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,203
But does it need to be?

465
00:34:03,365 --> 00:34:08,278
I mean, you could stay here.
You could stay here with...

466
00:34:08,741 --> 00:34:10,301
with me.

467
00:34:12,292 --> 00:34:13,760
I belong with Robin.

468
00:34:17,078 --> 00:34:19,737
If I were Robin Hood,
I would never leave your side.

469
00:34:20,778 --> 00:34:23,601
I saw him... Robin.

470
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,226
- He visited me here.
- Really?

471
00:34:28,553 --> 00:34:30,426
There 's something I should tell you.

472
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:34,784
Robin...

473
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:39,112
This is top-secret.

474
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:44,271
Robin has found...

475
00:34:45,091 --> 00:34:46,316
Yes?

476
00:34:48,977 --> 00:34:49,983
Nothing.

477
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,659
Thank you.

478
00:34:54,653 --> 00:34:55,451
Why?

479
00:34:55,497 --> 00:34:59,728
For not telling me
what Lady Marian asked you to tell me.

480
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,647
I knew she was wrong about you.

481
00:35:07,422 --> 00:35:09,446
No, Much, just...

482
00:35:11,503 --> 00:35:12,925
She was right.

483
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,535
Of course, I'm working for the Sheriff.

484
00:35:16,495 --> 00:35:17,674
Oh.

485
00:35:18,728 --> 00:35:22,800
But tell me whatever it is
you want him to hear.

486
00:35:28,951 --> 00:35:30,615
- Marian!
- Sir Guy.

487
00:35:32,245 --> 00:35:33,401
I'm sorry.

488
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:39,738
- Where is your betrothal ring?
- I felt dishonest wearing it.

489
00:35:40,063 --> 00:35:42,514
I'm afraid we have misunderstood
each other lately.

490
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,282
I assumed you would be true to your word.

491
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:47,508
You perhaps thought I would not mind
if you let me down.

492
00:35:48,425 --> 00:35:51,407
- I sincerely did not intend that.
- I don't care.

493
00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:53,546
I thought you were a better man.

494
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:57,366
Now I realize I must content myself
with disappointment.

495
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:00,268
I had to make a choice.

496
00:36:00,302 --> 00:36:02,984
You know that I'm all that stands
between you and the Sheriff

497
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:05,329
and I would not see you harmed.

498
00:36:05,468 --> 00:36:07,098
I have to protect you.

499
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:12,300
Will you wear the ring again?

500
00:36:17,687 --> 00:36:18,808
Of course.

501
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:22,554
But we will never find ourselves
in this situation again.

502
00:36:23,074 --> 00:36:25,213
Everything is back in its box.

503
00:36:37,043 --> 00:36:39,805
- My lord!
- Ah!

504
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:46,537
The delightfully cruel
and gloriously deceiving Eve.

505
00:36:50,243 --> 00:36:52,028
Do you have news for me?

506
00:36:53,243 --> 00:36:55,232
Come. Sit.

507
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,106
Delight me.

508
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:02,173
Does Greek fire mean anything to you?

509
00:37:02,243 --> 00:37:04,401
Yes.

510
00:37:04,475 --> 00:37:07,339
Well, then, there is a ledger.

511
00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:08,675
Oh, pleasure.

512
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,438
Oh, such pleasure.

513
00:37:11,531 --> 00:37:14,407
And it's hidden in one of the barrels.

514
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,431
What is Greek fire?

515
00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:20,969
Oh, that really doesn't need to concern you,

516
00:37:20,979 --> 00:37:23,927
my sweet, sweet Eve.

517
00:37:25,841 --> 00:37:27,807
As ever...

518
00:37:28,908 --> 00:37:30,669
you are...

519
00:37:32,242 --> 00:37:34,330
an asset.

520
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:39,004
In black powder barrels.

521
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,773
Gisborne!

522
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:01,608
Gisborne'll be leading Robin
to the black powder,

523
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:04,187
but the Sheriff will work it out soon, I'm sure.

524
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:06,755
- Do you regret what you have done?
- No.

525
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:10,269
Well, take everything.

526
00:38:10,385 --> 00:38:12,326
- Anything of value.
- No, I can't possibly.

527
00:38:12,327 --> 00:38:16,269
- These are your possessions.
- You must. We're taking from the rich - me.

528
00:38:16,304 --> 00:38:19,421
And giving to the poor... which is you.

529
00:38:20,034 --> 00:38:21,997
You are a good man.

530
00:38:22,832 --> 00:38:26,102
You are the bravest,
loveliest girl I have ever met.

531
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,917
Really?

532
00:38:31,106 --> 00:38:32,252
Really.

533
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:36,298
Will I see you again?

534
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:40,157
When there is justice again,

535
00:38:40,573 --> 00:38:42,758
I will come and find you.

536
00:38:53,495 --> 00:38:54,893
Perhaps before.

537
00:39:00,622 --> 00:39:03,200
Robin will thank you from his heart
for what you have done.

538
00:39:03,604 --> 00:39:05,562
I did not do this for Robin Hood.

539
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:08,671
I did it for you.

540
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,234
It's a cave.

541
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:44,448
And thanks to our friend,
the Earl of Bonchurch,

542
00:39:44,506 --> 00:39:46,675
Gisborne led us straight to it.

543
00:39:46,698 --> 00:39:49,010
- So what do we do now?
- We wait.

544
00:40:03,521 --> 00:40:04,943
There 's nothing here.

545
00:40:06,746 --> 00:40:07,971
Move!

546
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,133
Go, go...

547
00:40:19,779 --> 00:40:22,092
Right, let's get to it. Come on.

548
00:40:26,852 --> 00:40:29,567
Just this can destroy men and mountains.

549
00:40:31,708 --> 00:40:33,523
It is inconceivable.

550
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:37,463
Hood got there first.

551
00:40:37,764 --> 00:40:39,614
The ledger's gone.

552
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:45,129
Didn't you tell me that you'd hidden
the barrels of black powder?

553
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:47,580
I did. Yes, I did.

554
00:40:48,274 --> 00:40:50,713
- Who else did you tell?
- No one.

555
00:40:51,453 --> 00:40:53,568
So, how did he find it before you?

556
00:40:57,139 --> 00:40:59,821
- Were you followed, Gisborne?
- No.

557
00:41:00,896 --> 00:41:02,584
You fool!

558
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,214
We've been set up!

559
00:41:04,468 --> 00:41:07,078
Dispatch every man you can to the caves!

560
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:10,026
Bring me Eve and fetch me my horse!

561
00:41:15,972 --> 00:41:17,290
Show time.

562
00:41:35,233 --> 00:41:36,933
Gisborne!

563
00:41:38,077 --> 00:41:39,938
What are you waiting for? Get him!

564
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,395
You have five seconds left in this world.

565
00:41:45,695 --> 00:41:47,522
This is for you, Lambert.

566
00:41:47,788 --> 00:41:49,927
Four! Three!

567
00:41:50,874 --> 00:41:52,364
Two!

568
00:41:52,648 --> 00:41:53,989
One!

569
00:41:55,793 --> 00:42:00,621
Run!

570
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,023
Life is a cruel mistress, Gisborne.

571
00:42:36,564 --> 00:42:37,963
Clean up your mess.

572
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:45,989
Hey, if I burn it, that's not you, is it?

573
00:42:46,428 --> 00:42:50,139
No, I mean, technically, you kept your word.

574
00:42:53,573 --> 00:42:55,390
This is not about one man's wish.

575
00:43:01,885 --> 00:43:03,734
It's good to have you back, Much.

576
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:07,479
It's good to have you back, my lord Much.

577
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:09,408
That is gonna get really annoying.

578
00:43:09,409 --> 00:43:11,022
That's gonna get really annoying, my lord.

579
00:43:12,889 --> 00:43:16,761
It is really annoying, but I'm sorry...

580
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:18,920
I like it.

581
00:43:19,025 --> 00:43:21,892
Well, seeing as though you like lording it up...

582
00:43:22,597 --> 00:43:24,458
To Lord Much!

583
00:43:25,285 --> 00:43:27,188
To Lord Much!

584
00:43:39,097 --> 00:43:42,969
- All right, all right.
- All hail Lord Much! All hail Lord Much!

585
00:43:43,189 --> 00:43:44,528
Let's burn him!

586
00:43:51,144 --> 00:43:54,496
