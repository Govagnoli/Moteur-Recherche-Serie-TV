1
00:00:00,866 --> 00:00:03,560
Get in there! Get in!

2
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:10,651
- You owe two shillings.
- Mercy, my lord.

3
00:00:10,652 --> 00:00:12,529
You've had a week to find it, now pay up.

4
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:14,624
If he has no money, take goods to the value.

5
00:00:15,078 --> 00:00:16,861
If he has nothing of value, take him.

6
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:21,833
This is the King's annual duty
to finance his crusade against the heathen.

7
00:00:22,992 --> 00:00:28,438
You can't pay, you go to prison.
Sheriff's decree - no exceptions, no tolerance.

8
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:30,428
Next cottage.

9
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:40,126
Gisborne's men. Now we know
why Luke couldn't make the weapons drop.

10
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:42,863
If the King knew what was being
done in his name...

11
00:00:49,537 --> 00:00:51,901
Alice.

12
00:00:52,263 --> 00:00:54,361
John, come here a moment.

13
00:00:57,105 --> 00:00:58,451
Act normal, we don't know anything.

14
00:00:58,452 --> 00:01:00,366
Ah, the cooper.

15
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:04,700
He owes three shillings.

16
00:01:05,539 --> 00:01:08,699
Take what you want,
I have no money left to give you.

17
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,736
Goods to the value.

18
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:15,235
Move! And you.

19
00:01:20,107 --> 00:01:23,801
We could hardly pay the tithe rent as it was,
and now another tax.

20
00:01:23,874 --> 00:01:26,397
It's stupid to go on like this, Alice.

21
00:01:27,308 --> 00:01:29,422
I'm fond of you and the boy.

22
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:31,766
As man and wife,
we could cover the taxes.

23
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:34,042
No, get away from there.

24
00:01:34,043 --> 00:01:35,039
- Come here, you rat.
- Leave us alone.

25
00:01:35,048 --> 00:01:39,135
- John!
- Leave us alone, get off!

26
00:01:39,136 --> 00:01:42,764
Here. Here, sir, our tools.

27
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:45,004
They must be worth a few coins, take them.

28
00:01:45,076 --> 00:01:48,803
- Leave us alone!
- My lord, weapons.

29
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:51,104
- Well, well, well.
- Stop it!

30
00:01:51,176 --> 00:01:53,506
Saracen design.

31
00:01:53,577 --> 00:01:55,043
- Get off!
- Now...

32
00:01:55,877 --> 00:01:58,900
Where does a Locksley cooper
learn this type of work?

33
00:02:00,878 --> 00:02:04,539
There 's only one Englishman I know
that uses a bow like this.

34
00:02:06,678 --> 00:02:11,441
Collaborate with outlaws
and you will be punished like an outlaw.

35
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:15,811
- Take him away.
- No!

36
00:02:17,158 --> 00:02:18,512
- Papa!
- No, John!

37
00:02:19,498 --> 00:02:21,077
No!

38
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:26,374
Sir! P lease, I beg you,
don't hurt the boy.

39
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,470
My apprentice, he's innocent.

40
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:29,671
The runt.

41
00:02:29,747 --> 00:02:32,145
Oh, we must make an example of him.

42
00:02:32,214 --> 00:02:34,874
- Take the boy too.
- Leave him alone!

43
00:02:34,948 --> 00:02:36,543
Take your hands off my son!

44
00:02:36,544 --> 00:02:38,374
John, John. There are too many.

45
00:02:38,447 --> 00:02:39,708
He's innocent!

46
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:44,371
- John!
- He's my son!

47
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:47,658
And we will help him, but not this way.

48
00:02:47,808 --> 00:02:49,279
John!

49
00:02:55,316 --> 00:02:59,806
- Little John!
- Mother! Help us!

50
00:03:01,618 --> 00:03:03,299
Mother !

51
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:06,945
Mother, help!

52
00:03:07,018 --> 00:03:09,143
Little John!

53
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,902
Synched and adapted by
ScarHand for the SubWood Team

54
00:03:49,077 --> 00:03:51,784
John, stop. We need the others.

55
00:03:51,785 --> 00:03:53,415
- The coach is too well guarded.
- No!

56
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,585
I will not let you do this. It is too reckless.

57
00:03:55,655 --> 00:03:58,902
- They have my son!
- I value your life too highly.

58
00:03:58,903 --> 00:04:00,886
Him, I value more.

59
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:10,521
Clear the path!
Move that branch out of the way.

60
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,613
Get that log cleared. Go on.

61
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,054
Put your backs into it.

62
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:22,388
Come on, then! Come on!

63
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,948
Hang on. Hang on.

64
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,392
Get the cab to Nottingham!

65
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:17,761
John...

66
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:38,454
NOTTINGHAM TOWN
Halt! You may pass.

67
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:40,202
NOTTINGHAM TOWN

68
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:52,089
- Out of the way, scum.
- All right!

69
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,996
Taxes! Taxes!

70
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:57,504
Last day for the King's levy. Come on now.

71
00:05:57,505 --> 00:05:58,899
Taxes?

72
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:00,660
- Taxes.
- We're here to collect taxes.

73
00:06:01,134 --> 00:06:03,566
You three, you paid your ale tax?

74
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:06,498
- You what? Ale taxes?
- Take them away.

75
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,697
What are you doing? I haven't done anything.

76
00:06:08,698 --> 00:06:10,257
- Gambling, now?
- You must be kidding.

77
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:13,529
Bet you haven't got a license, eh?

78
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:17,801
- You lose! Take him away.
- Ah!

79
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:19,699
We can't help everyone.

80
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:22,201
We got to find my mate's wife
and we have deliveries to make.

81
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,902
- Spare some coins, sir?
- Ah, there she is.

82
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,095
Her husband died two nights ago.

83
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,728
The Sheriff's men beat him up.

84
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:42,169
It's a gift from Robin Hood.

85
00:06:43,573 --> 00:06:46,560
She looks like a vagrant to me, and her brat.

86
00:06:47,304 --> 00:06:49,236
Where did you steal this from, then, eh?

87
00:06:49,304 --> 00:06:51,032
Take her away.

88
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:01,102
Go, quickly.

89
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:03,661
- Thank you, thank you.
- Will!

90
00:07:04,706 --> 00:07:06,638
- Guards!
- Come back here!

91
00:07:07,306 --> 00:07:10,154
- Get them!
- Make way for the prisoners.

92
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:22,307
- Go!
- Little John?

93
00:07:36,876 --> 00:07:39,638
I've had one of these pointed in my face before.
Very pretty.

94
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,403
What does this have to do with
the King's annual duty?

95
00:07:42,476 --> 00:07:44,840
We found this whilst collecting in Locksley.

96
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,104
The man who made it
has been supplying Robin Hood.

97
00:07:48,352 --> 00:07:51,025
And you have him here,
in the dungeons?

98
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,536
Ah. Well, now you interest me.

99
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:04,225
Our troops could benefit from this bowmaker' s
skill, we must learn from him.

100
00:08:04,387 --> 00:08:05,683
Learn?

101
00:08:06,597 --> 00:08:07,863
We should execute him.

102
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:12,160
Do I detect a note of sourness in your tone,
Gisborne, hm?

103
00:08:12,623 --> 00:08:15,595
Disillusioned with life
as Lord of Locksley Manor, hm?

104
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,702
Peasants don't like you very much?

105
00:08:17,703 --> 00:08:20,399
Wish Robin Hood would come back?
Oh, what a shame.

106
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,348
If a peasant defies us,
we must punish him.

107
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,933
Hard.

108
00:08:25,142 --> 00:08:27,525
We must make an example of him
in front of the rest.

109
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:29,493
We must make a event of it.

110
00:08:31,274 --> 00:08:32,675
An event?

111
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:34,688
Why not?

112
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:38,822
I'll invite all the leaders of the local community,
attendance compulsory.

113
00:08:39,991 --> 00:08:41,830
We should be very creative
in our use of punishments.

114
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:46,045
The scourge - I love a good lashing.
Mutilation, of course torture.

115
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:49,570
But right here,
right here in the great hall.

116
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:52,076
Ah... A Festival of Pain.

117
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,185
We need to use our heads.
This is not just about John.

118
00:08:58,186 --> 00:08:59,995
Luke the cooper was trying
to help us, and the boy.

119
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:01,744
We have a responsibility to them too.

120
00:09:01,871 --> 00:09:04,879
- I did not know John had a family.
- Neither did he till recently.

121
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,010
As soon the Sheriff realizes
he's one of us, he'll be hanged.

122
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:09,844
That's the thing.
The Sheriff won't necessarily know.

123
00:09:09,845 --> 00:09:13,119
- What? These...
- Without these, he's just another outlaw.

124
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,520
He has never been just another outlaw.

125
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,661
You think the Sheriff cares if
he wears one of these or not?

126
00:09:16,662 --> 00:09:18,703
He's right. They'll hang him anyway.

127
00:09:19,883 --> 00:09:21,781
Which is why we need a really good plan.

128
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:25,344
Most unfortunate.

129
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:28,912
A craftsman like you
wasting your skills on outlaws.

130
00:09:30,827 --> 00:09:33,303
I've always admired artisans.

131
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,131
Make me Saracen war bows like Robin Hood's

132
00:09:41,293 --> 00:09:42,983
and all this will stop.

133
00:09:44,301 --> 00:09:47,880
I might even allow you
a little more time to pay your taxes.

134
00:09:52,056 --> 00:09:54,317
Such talent...

135
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,143
All going to waste.

136
00:09:56,235 --> 00:09:57,548
Continue.

137
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:00,894
If he doesn't speak, well...

138
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:02,386
start with the boy.

139
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,589
Please, why won't you let me through?

140
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,087
- He's just a little boy.
- No.

141
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:16,705
If I could just speak to the Sheriff.
I just want to see my son.

142
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:19,192
Why won't you let me through?

143
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,143
I just need to see him.

144
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:35,415
It seems the Sheriff is determined
to arrest half of Nottingham.

145
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:39,081
Just reminding them of their obligations
to the Sheriff and the King,

146
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,947
and of their loyalty to their betters.

147
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:45,349
Well, if their obligations
are higher and higher taxes,

148
00:10:45,616 --> 00:10:48,555
is it any wonder they need
reminding of their loyalty?

149
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:51,714
They have nothing to give
and yet they are being punished.

150
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:53,952
Ah, Marian.

151
00:10:54,206 --> 00:10:55,653
I thought I heard your voice.

152
00:10:55,815 --> 00:10:57,817
Charming as ever, even in dissent.

153
00:10:57,944 --> 00:11:00,941
Who is the one who took out
the squad of soldiers single-handed?

154
00:11:01,034 --> 00:11:03,367
- This one, sir.
- Mm. Ugly brute.

155
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:09,576
And yet, I feel I have seen him
somewhere before.

156
00:11:13,252 --> 00:11:15,289
Do you think he looks like
one of Robin Hood's men?

157
00:11:15,463 --> 00:11:17,093
Outlaws all look the same to me.

158
00:11:17,823 --> 00:11:18,910
No necklace, sir.

159
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,387
Obviously just a common brute.

160
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:24,687
Certainly looks wild enough, though.

161
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:27,418
Not so tough now are we, eh, wild man?

162
00:11:28,216 --> 00:11:30,854
Certainly beat some civilization into you.

163
00:11:30,947 --> 00:11:32,822
Roll on tomorrow's entertainments.

164
00:11:33,088 --> 00:11:35,507
- Entertainments?
- Festival of Pain!

165
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:38,644
And throw that brute into the dungeons,
soften him up.

166
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:43,534
And you know where
you can stick your pipe, too!

167
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:45,004
Come here, you toe rag!

168
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,589
- You know where to meet with the horses?
- Round the back of the Trip To Jerusalem Inn.

169
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:04,126
When we rescue them,
we'll need to leave here fast, so don't be late.

170
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:05,445
How about this?

171
00:12:05,607 --> 00:12:07,840
Your mother wouldn't recognize you.

172
00:12:09,252 --> 00:12:11,046
Come on, let's get on with it.

173
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:14,205
Will, consider yourself under arrest.

174
00:12:14,335 --> 00:12:16,642
You cannot seriously countenance such cruelty.

175
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:19,235
- Marian...
- It is not punishment, it is barbaric.

176
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,664
Delicious, is it not, hm?

177
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:25,958
There is an air of poetry about,
the poetry of pain.

178
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:33,103
Oh, our peasant's advocate seems
rather upset with me, Gisborne.

179
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:37,892
Drip, drip, drip...

180
00:12:38,436 --> 00:12:41,408
I can hear her heart bleed from here.

181
00:12:43,826 --> 00:12:48,397
Fear humbles even the most
rebellious spirit, my dear.

182
00:12:49,161 --> 00:12:54,081
Robin Hood himself
will come to fear me one day, in time.

183
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,471
Don't doubt it.

184
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:02,540
My lord, do not forget the wagon with
the King's duty leaves for London tomorrow.

185
00:13:02,552 --> 00:13:06,329
That is your responsibility, Gisborne.
Just make sure it's secure.

186
00:13:06,595 --> 00:13:09,095
Take the whole garrison if needs be.

187
00:13:09,627 --> 00:13:14,350
I would hate to be in your shoes
if all this fell into outlaws' hands.

188
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,747
Especially after all the trouble
we went to collecting it.

189
00:13:18,395 --> 00:13:20,836
Is the castle guard sufficient
for your entertainments?

190
00:13:20,837 --> 00:13:22,735
No, take all you need.

191
00:13:22,955 --> 00:13:26,297
I presume you are going to accompany
the cart, personally.

192
00:13:26,294 --> 00:13:28,495
I will take the wagon as far as the crossroads,

193
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:32,082
from there two garrisons from Mansfield
will be escorting it as far as London.

194
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,446
Lah-di-dah-di-dah.

195
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:37,269
Only a fool would attack against such odds.

196
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,984
When we get out of here,

197
00:13:45,076 --> 00:13:47,194
I'll make you a bow of your own.

198
00:13:48,235 --> 00:13:49,909
I'll teach how to use it.

199
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:54,387
We'll hunt together. Just you and me.

200
00:14:19,395 --> 00:14:21,478
Forgive the child, friend.

201
00:14:21,883 --> 00:14:23,614
He's frightened, that's all.

202
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:25,662
It's him.

203
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:30,337
That's the man that attacked the guards
on the road from Locksley.

204
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:35,543
You tried to rescue us?

205
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:38,182
What do our tools mean to you?

206
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:43,517
Are you Robin Hood?

207
00:14:47,577 --> 00:14:51,361
- No.
- Then... why?

208
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:55,546
Little John, leave the poor man alone.

209
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,036
It's all right.

210
00:15:01,993 --> 00:15:03,312
You and me...

211
00:15:03,728 --> 00:15:05,453
we met before.

212
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:11,242
I don't remember, sorry.

213
00:15:28,818 --> 00:15:31,028
Get along there, go on.

214
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:35,938
Get along there.

215
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:38,206
- That hurt.
- Don't overdo it, Allan.

216
00:15:38,832 --> 00:15:39,943
Hold it there.

217
00:15:39,977 --> 00:15:42,367
We've got another one
for t'dungeon here. All right?

218
00:15:42,368 --> 00:15:43,375
Go on, then.

219
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,400
Come on, then.

220
00:15:48,624 --> 00:15:50,175
Get along there.

221
00:15:51,135 --> 00:15:52,165
What?

222
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:54,556
Hey, calm down.

223
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:56,279
Where do you think you're going?

224
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,937
- There 's a prisoner for t'dungeons.
- You're too late. It's full.

225
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,962
Put him over there with that lot.

226
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,029
- This one seems familiar.
- He's a known troublemaker.

227
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,719
Chain him up with the others.

228
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,750
Yeah, they'll all get
what's coming to them, tomorrow.

229
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:28,012
Now how do we get in?

230
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:47,871
Boo! My lady.

231
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,741
The prisoners. I heard there were
families down there, children.

232
00:16:50,972 --> 00:16:52,823
Do they have enough food and water?

233
00:16:52,962 --> 00:16:55,387
This is not some soft inn
for their pleasure, my lady.

234
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:57,296
That is no reason to ill-treat them.

235
00:16:58,673 --> 00:17:02,006
Actually, I thought I might be
able to see the wild man.

236
00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:03,625
I'm rather intrigued.

237
00:17:04,864 --> 00:17:07,177
No, can't let you in. Sorry.

238
00:17:13,842 --> 00:17:15,301
I want every entrance covered.

239
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,645
Marian?

240
00:17:19,096 --> 00:17:19,786
Guy.

241
00:17:20,641 --> 00:17:22,642
I was just looking for my portmanteau.

242
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:27,028
I don't know whether they...
took it from the horse already or...

243
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,354
I will have it bought to your room.

244
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,958
I'm glad you decided to stay.

245
00:17:33,074 --> 00:17:35,782
I didn't like to think of you
all alone at Knighton Hall,

246
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,726
with your father away.

247
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,508
May I pass?

248
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:48,376
Oi, you! Got a job for you.

249
00:17:50,141 --> 00:17:51,993
Not you... Shirker.

250
00:17:52,097 --> 00:17:54,519
Have the Lady Marian's portmanteau
taken from her horse in the stables

251
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,942
and follow me with it to her chamber.

252
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:58,223
- Yes, my lord.
- Quickly!

253
00:18:01,866 --> 00:18:02,571
Oi!

254
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:05,880
Are those the sacks of 
grain from Locksley?

255
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,070
- Yeah.
- Well, move them into the stores, then.

256
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,967
Now!

257
00:18:43,968 --> 00:18:45,067
Can you get that?

258
00:18:45,148 --> 00:18:46,387
Oh, yes!

259
00:18:46,468 --> 00:18:48,990
Oh, yes! Oh!

260
00:18:56,614 --> 00:18:57,505
Come in.

261
00:18:59,863 --> 00:19:01,251
Marian, your things.

262
00:19:01,252 --> 00:19:02,629
Over there.

263
00:19:06,705 --> 00:19:09,112
Careful, you clumsy oaf!

264
00:19:09,968 --> 00:19:11,332
Marian?

265
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,089
I'm quite well.

266
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,774
Could you put them over there by the bed?

267
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:26,207
Wait.

268
00:19:28,545 --> 00:19:30,547
Is there something else I can do for you?

269
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:32,538
Nothing, thank you.

270
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:39,993
Marian, um...

271
00:19:40,317 --> 00:19:43,419
- For some time now...
- I thought I would rest before dinner.

272
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:45,868
Hear me out, please.

273
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:49,373
Is there something the matter?

274
00:19:49,374 --> 00:19:51,832
No, I'm a little out of sorts, that is all.

275
00:19:53,898 --> 00:19:58,886
Since we came to our understanding,
you have been constantly in my thoughts.

276
00:20:00,922 --> 00:20:05,909
Without you, I no longer feel... quite whole.

277
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,256
Please, Sir Guy.
I would rather not talk about this now.

278
00:20:08,257 --> 00:20:09,934
Don't send me away.

279
00:20:15,927 --> 00:20:20,799
We should be spending more time together,
so that we can understand each other better.

280
00:20:21,158 --> 00:20:22,419
I want to know you.

281
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:25,546
- I am sorry, I cannot.
- Marian...

282
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,104
Be with me.

283
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,436
Please, Guy, not now.

284
00:20:35,122 --> 00:20:37,495
Perhaps you will at least think over
what I have said.

285
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,776
Please don't send me away.

286
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,223
We should be spending more time together.

287
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:17,002
I thought they would kill him.
But still he will not tell them what they wanted.

288
00:21:17,928 --> 00:21:19,085
Brave man.

289
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,489
Him, I like.

290
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,581
Did you know my mother?

291
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,554
I don't remember you.

292
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:34,625
Unless...

293
00:21:35,447 --> 00:21:37,294
Mother said I dreamt it.

294
00:21:37,815 --> 00:21:41,066
There was a man once.
He came to our house.

295
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,659
- He was from the forest.
- That was real.

296
00:21:43,948 --> 00:21:45,186
That was me.

297
00:21:46,216 --> 00:21:47,316
What's your name?

298
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,861
I did know your mother once.

299
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:55,615
My father, he was big.

300
00:21:55,765 --> 00:21:56,668
A giant.

301
00:21:57,506 --> 00:21:59,010
Bigger than you even.

302
00:21:59,392 --> 00:22:02,667
Though... I never knew him.

303
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:05,858
John.

304
00:22:08,623 --> 00:22:11,262
We will get out of here.

305
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,432
I promise you.

306
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,337
You're mad to be here at all.

307
00:22:17,661 --> 00:22:21,011
Extra guards have been laid on.
The place is full of prisoners.

308
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,616
You know about the Sheriff's plans
for tomorrow?

309
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:25,803
- The punishments?
- Yes.

310
00:22:26,718 --> 00:22:29,228
- And I intend to stop it.
- With what?

311
00:22:29,229 --> 00:22:30,836
You are few against many.

312
00:22:30,837 --> 00:22:33,522
We few have proved 
quite effective in the past.

313
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,137
We will rescue them, all of them.

314
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:40,231
I have a plan. Well, half a plan, I think.

315
00:22:40,232 --> 00:22:41,552
How?

316
00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:45,339
I never give up...

317
00:22:46,276 --> 00:22:47,688
on anyone.

318
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:50,783
You may discover it is too late for some.

319
00:22:54,362 --> 00:22:57,671
I mean, the way the prisoners
have been treated,

320
00:22:57,845 --> 00:22:59,499
most of them are beyond help.

321
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,549
The bowmaker of Locksley
has already been tortured.

322
00:23:02,873 --> 00:23:05,615
Guy wanted a special example made of him.

323
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:07,593
He is the first to be punished.

324
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:12,442
Yet he plays the gallant gentleman
and he does so want to know you.

325
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:14,294
And you should be glad.

326
00:23:14,503 --> 00:23:16,249
It is because I know him,

327
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,664
I am able to tell you the revenue wagon
leaves tomorrow for London,

328
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:22,266
- with the King's annual duty.
- And?

329
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:25,152
The Sheriff thinks you will try
to save your friend, the bowmaker,

330
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,409
whilst the wagon leaves unchallenged.

331
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:32,234
Right. I have a plan.

332
00:23:32,616 --> 00:23:34,100
Well, where are they?

333
00:23:34,528 --> 00:23:36,183
He said don't be late.

334
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,985
I mean, what if he can't rescue Little John?

335
00:23:41,482 --> 00:23:43,415
What if the Sheriff's hanged him already?

336
00:23:43,565 --> 00:23:45,539
I mean, we've been late once before.

337
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,566
Just shut up, OK?

338
00:23:48,145 --> 00:23:49,476
Shut up.

339
00:23:50,487 --> 00:23:51,320
Sorry.

340
00:23:52,003 --> 00:23:55,717
I have money.
It's only a few coins but if you let me through...

341
00:23:55,718 --> 00:23:57,592
Go home, woman.

342
00:23:58,275 --> 00:23:59,976
Please, I want...

343
00:24:01,392 --> 00:24:02,629
I want my son.

344
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,210
Now, I'd like to sit on
the right-hand side of Marian,

345
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:07,152
so I can see what a bleeding heart looks like.

346
00:24:07,164 --> 00:24:08,320
Of course, my lord.
Whatever you wish.

347
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,766
- My son!
- Oi! You can't go in there.

348
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:12,154
You have imprisoned him.

349
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:15,139
- Get that woman out of here.
- He was arrested in Locksley this morning.

350
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,397
- He's just a boy.
- What's she saying?

351
00:24:17,398 --> 00:24:19,908
This is the business
of the bowmaker and his boy.

352
00:24:20,197 --> 00:24:21,737
The outlaw collaborators.

353
00:24:21,738 --> 00:24:24,758
Oh. And this is the mother of the child?

354
00:24:27,895 --> 00:24:30,348
Oh, come, have some compassion.

355
00:24:30,707 --> 00:24:31,875
Gisborne.

356
00:24:32,361 --> 00:24:34,896
Surely she should be allowed to see her son.

357
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,715
Such insistent maternal concern.

358
00:24:38,105 --> 00:24:41,101
Well, it should stir pity.

359
00:24:41,102 --> 00:24:43,370
Such a pretty face.

360
00:24:44,365 --> 00:24:47,708
It should inspire our respect, 
but this one, however,

361
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:50,463
conceals deceit, disloyalty.

362
00:24:51,053 --> 00:24:52,742
So, take her away,

363
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,557
have her put in the cell
with her son and the cooper.

364
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:00,689
One bad apple in a family,

365
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,564
and we punish the whole barrel.

366
00:25:08,648 --> 00:25:10,025
Mother!

367
00:25:11,217 --> 00:25:13,577
I knew you'd come.

368
00:25:18,455 --> 00:25:20,770
What's going on? What's happening?

369
00:25:20,781 --> 00:25:23,026
I'm staying with you now.

370
00:25:24,137 --> 00:25:24,993
Luke.

371
00:25:26,688 --> 00:25:30,356
- I don't understand.
- What have they done to you?

372
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:32,682
John has been looking after me.

373
00:25:33,087 --> 00:25:34,788
Is he badly hurt?

374
00:25:35,253 --> 00:25:36,480
We'll get him out of here.

375
00:25:36,688 --> 00:25:39,894
- That's what my friend said.
- Your friend?

376
00:25:41,757 --> 00:25:44,845
It wasn't a dream.
The man from the forest.

377
00:25:44,846 --> 00:25:47,009
The one that came to our house.

378
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:54,972
Come on.

379
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:06,323
What's the matter?

380
00:26:12,854 --> 00:26:14,393
You're alive.

381
00:26:35,718 --> 00:26:37,130
Thank you, Marian.

382
00:26:52,246 --> 00:26:54,908
So, you're going to leave me
locked up here all night?

383
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,598
- Yes.
- You're meant to say no.

384
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:59,242
We're here to free you, stuff like that.

385
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:02,551
Don't worry, there's a good reason for it.

386
00:27:02,552 --> 00:27:04,985
Now, take this lock pick.

387
00:27:05,436 --> 00:27:07,577
A friend of mine told me where to find it.

388
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:10,346
Tomorrow morning, during this Festival of Pain,

389
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,938
you will help John
and these other prisoners escape.

390
00:27:13,597 --> 00:27:17,497
- Do you think these men are with us?
- They've got nothing else to lose.

391
00:27:20,077 --> 00:27:23,027
I'll get word to Much and Djaq.
I'll come back tonight.

392
00:27:23,028 --> 00:27:23,977
Right, scum.

393
00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:28,408
You are not to speak to him again.

394
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:29,923
Who is he, Alice?

395
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,729
No one.

396
00:27:33,546 --> 00:27:34,703
A dead man.

397
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,151
But he's here now, with us.

398
00:27:39,152 --> 00:27:41,187
- First and last time.
- Alice, please...

399
00:27:41,188 --> 00:27:44,440
Do not speak to me.
You gave up that right long ago.

400
00:27:45,088 --> 00:27:46,037
This man...

401
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,921
Is he who I think he is?

402
00:27:51,553 --> 00:27:53,786
Burns have given you a fever.

403
00:27:54,295 --> 00:27:56,540
John, stay away from there.

404
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:00,293
I'm sorry.

405
00:28:00,652 --> 00:28:02,596
I can't be your friend any more.

406
00:28:02,712 --> 00:28:05,430
- I know.
- I said stay away from him.

407
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:07,629
- Alice, it's not the boy's fault.
- He is not your friend.

408
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,642
He is not anybody, you understand?

409
00:28:09,643 --> 00:28:12,796
- Aren't we in enough trouble?
- He's in the same situation.

410
00:28:12,797 --> 00:28:15,897
- We all need each other now.
- Mother...

411
00:28:16,233 --> 00:28:20,591
Alice... Alice, perhaps the boy should know.

412
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:28,960
John...

413
00:28:30,568 --> 00:28:32,154
This man...

414
00:28:32,987 --> 00:28:34,298
What is it?

415
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:38,737
John...

416
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,417
I am your father.

417
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:48,016
Stop worrying.

418
00:28:48,051 --> 00:28:49,428
I'm not worried.

419
00:28:50,053 --> 00:28:52,113
I'm not worried at all, I'm just...

420
00:28:53,577 --> 00:28:54,814
All will be fine.

421
00:28:57,205 --> 00:28:59,010
What do you think you're doing?

422
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:03,568
Er, nothing.

423
00:29:04,262 --> 00:29:10,346
Just, er... my horse. It's lame and, er...
I just wanted to rest him here.

424
00:29:12,104 --> 00:29:14,220
All right, it's me.

425
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:16,223
Don't do that!

426
00:29:16,408 --> 00:29:18,682
- Where have you been?
- Where is Little John?

427
00:29:19,052 --> 00:29:20,360
There 's been a change of plan.

428
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:23,006
- Change of plan?
- I found the distraction we needed.

429
00:29:23,007 --> 00:29:25,515
- We're still rescuing Little John?
- Of course we are.

430
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:27,760
And Luke the bowmaker,

431
00:29:27,761 --> 00:29:29,323
and the boy, and...

432
00:29:29,983 --> 00:29:31,428
Alice Little...

433
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:33,430
and all the other prisoners.

434
00:29:33,436 --> 00:29:35,043
Oh, and the tax money.

435
00:29:35,044 --> 00:29:37,544
Not a big change, then...

436
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:41,686
You let me believe you were dead.

437
00:29:41,687 --> 00:29:44,091
I was outlawed. If I'd stayed...

438
00:29:44,102 --> 00:29:48,174
You might have seen your son born,
and provided for your family.

439
00:29:48,175 --> 00:29:51,450
Where were you those winters your baby son
was sick with hunger?

440
00:29:51,913 --> 00:29:56,567
Or the first summer he had to work alongside
me in the field so we could buy a loaf of bread.

441
00:29:57,983 --> 00:30:01,432
Where were you when the Sheriff's guard
did that to his leg?

442
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,504
When you were younger,
before they told me your father was dead,

443
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:10,526
I used to tell you he would
come home to us one day,

444
00:30:10,931 --> 00:30:13,215
because I wanted to believe it myself.

445
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:17,600
And then, every time you heard
a horse pass through the village,

446
00:30:17,601 --> 00:30:20,344
you'd run out to see who it was, just in case.

447
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,834
Sheriff's mounted guard...

448
00:30:24,903 --> 00:30:27,586
would not stop for a peasant boy
standing in the road.

449
00:30:27,587 --> 00:30:30,606
Listen, you would have been outlawed too.

450
00:30:30,607 --> 00:30:33,638
It was better just to... to die.

451
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:35,990
We could have started 
again somewhere else.

452
00:30:36,071 --> 00:30:37,657
A new name.

453
00:30:38,548 --> 00:30:40,739
I would have followed you anywhere, John.

454
00:30:46,172 --> 00:30:47,549
Not that it matters.

455
00:30:48,961 --> 00:30:52,883
We're all outlaws here,
and tomorrow we shall suffer for it.

456
00:30:54,862 --> 00:30:56,596
Why do we want the sacks of grain?

457
00:30:56,597 --> 00:30:59,722
So Gisborne can take them to London.

458
00:31:03,882 --> 00:31:05,086
No, Robin.

459
00:31:05,421 --> 00:31:07,110
Stores are down near the kitchens, this way.

460
00:31:07,111 --> 00:31:10,048
First things first.
We secure the revenue money. Come on.

461
00:31:10,442 --> 00:31:16,109
...while you rob and murder,
and do what you do.

462
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,657
Alice, leave him.

463
00:31:17,993 --> 00:31:21,869
I have never killed, except to defend myself.

464
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,994
I robbed to survive,

465
00:31:25,538 --> 00:31:28,894
but now, l-I rob to help others.

466
00:31:28,905 --> 00:31:30,983
What? Like Robin Hood?

467
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,933
Yes, I am one of Robin Hood's men.

468
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,982
But you don't wear a tag.

469
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,771
Luke told me that all of 
Robin's men wear tags.

470
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:41,810
Ah, I lost them.

471
00:31:41,811 --> 00:31:43,281
And you expect us to believe you?

472
00:31:43,282 --> 00:31:45,318
It is the truth, Alice.

473
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,280
One lie was enough, John.

474
00:31:48,835 --> 00:31:51,545
Perhaps it's better for us all
if you just stay dead.

475
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,349
In fact, I wish you were dead,

476
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,914
then we won't hear your lies.

477
00:31:55,915 --> 00:32:00,762
The back parry originates in Fiorentina.
You've got to master that one first, Niall.

478
00:32:00,763 --> 00:32:02,302
We've come to relieve you lot.

479
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,580
- You're early.
- Hey, cheer up, lads.

480
00:32:04,581 --> 00:32:07,034
- Get the night off.
- What are you on about?

481
00:32:11,504 --> 00:32:13,159
Oh-ho! Look what I found.

482
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,839
Come on, let's get to work. Grab these.

483
00:32:17,058 --> 00:32:18,389
Lovely money.

484
00:32:18,632 --> 00:32:21,747
Good morning everybody
and welcome to my Festival of Pain.

485
00:32:22,164 --> 00:32:25,161
I want to talk to you about community taxes.

486
00:32:25,635 --> 00:32:27,741
Taxes are a fact.

487
00:32:29,026 --> 00:32:32,629
The cost of living in a free country.

488
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:39,629
Now, if you do not pay your taxes
then you sacrifice that freedom

489
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,971
and must be punished accordingly.

490
00:32:44,406 --> 00:32:48,780
I am sick and tired of your sob stories.

491
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:53,316
Can't pay, too old, too sick.

492
00:32:53,906 --> 00:32:58,256
Is this going to help
our beloved King in Acre, hm?

493
00:33:02,723 --> 00:33:04,400
A clue.

494
00:33:06,437 --> 00:33:07,942
No!

495
00:33:09,457 --> 00:33:11,402
Those who understand this...

496
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,208
they will survive.

497
00:33:18,045 --> 00:33:22,014
For those who defy me, well...

498
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:24,803
the chair of delight.

499
00:33:30,702 --> 00:33:32,657
John, get behind me.

500
00:33:32,658 --> 00:33:34,197
Stay behind me.

501
00:33:35,053 --> 00:33:37,448
You're still my friend.

502
00:33:42,108 --> 00:33:43,276
Forgive me.

503
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:50,310
Get it loaded up?

504
00:33:50,311 --> 00:33:52,336
Aye, it's all there, sir.

505
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,886
Ready to roll.

506
00:34:09,898 --> 00:34:12,455
These prisoners do not pay their way.

507
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:16,372
They help those
that seek to undermine my authority,

508
00:34:16,373 --> 00:34:19,174
therefore, they must all be punished.

509
00:34:21,176 --> 00:34:22,229
Now...

510
00:34:23,617 --> 00:34:26,628
Do you think that they're
the only ones to suffer,

511
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:28,492
do you? No, no, no.

512
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:31,546
No, because they do not pay their dues.

513
00:34:31,547 --> 00:34:34,776
We, the good citizens, well,
we have to pay more. Hm?

514
00:34:34,995 --> 00:34:38,931
And how on earth are we supposed to support
our king's glorious crusade? Thank you.

515
00:34:38,932 --> 00:34:44,267
If they were to pay their taxes,
then we in the community would pay less.

516
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:47,293
So, you see what I'm actually trying to do...

517
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:48,983
is lower taxes.

518
00:34:51,648 --> 00:34:54,747
Well, I'm feeling strangely moral.

519
00:34:54,748 --> 00:34:56,436
I'm feeling quite unwell, I think I might...

520
00:34:56,437 --> 00:34:58,022
Yes, probably the peasants, the stench.

521
00:34:58,023 --> 00:34:59,989
Here, sniff this if it gets too much.

522
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:04,294
So, let's bring the prisoners out
and start with a little burning, hm?

523
00:35:04,526 --> 00:35:07,566
Now, you people seem to think
that Robin Hood and his men,

524
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:10,297
they're worthy of your support
and your encouragement.

525
00:35:10,298 --> 00:35:13,848
- Well, let's see.
- Luke, the cooper of Locksley.

526
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:15,538
Outlaw collaborator...

527
00:35:16,209 --> 00:35:17,887
No!

528
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:21,206
I do forgive you.

529
00:35:23,315 --> 00:35:25,351
Alice of Locksley and her son, John.

530
00:35:25,352 --> 00:35:27,104
Outlaw sympathizers.

531
00:35:27,105 --> 00:35:29,910
Please, they had nothing to 
do with this. It is my doing.

532
00:35:31,051 --> 00:35:32,866
Oh, gallantry.

533
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:34,787
You see, Marian? It's not dead.

534
00:35:34,788 --> 00:35:36,488
Well, not yet.

535
00:35:42,087 --> 00:35:45,338
Such a gallant intervention, hm?

536
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,472
I wonder...

537
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:49,851
I wonder how I could reward that, hm?

538
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:53,887
Oh, I wonder.

539
00:35:54,593 --> 00:35:56,790
Shall we have him crawl in the coals first, hm?

540
00:35:56,791 --> 00:36:01,305
So gallant in the heat of the moment.
Oh, so gallant.

541
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,732
Shall the bowmaker go first or the apprentice?

542
00:36:06,987 --> 00:36:09,139
Decisions, decisions.

543
00:36:20,651 --> 00:36:22,155
Get along there.

544
00:36:35,475 --> 00:36:37,674
Why are they closing
the gates? Stop!

545
00:36:46,524 --> 00:36:48,340
Give me your knife.

546
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:55,305
Robin Hood!

547
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:57,502
We've been tricked.

548
00:36:57,503 --> 00:36:58,672
Open the gates!

549
00:37:02,773 --> 00:37:05,352
See, bowmaker of Locksley,
cross me and your family suffer.

550
00:37:05,353 --> 00:37:07,887
- No, no!
- So, who's first?

551
00:37:07,888 --> 00:37:11,271
I know. The boy? Oh, brave.

552
00:37:11,953 --> 00:37:14,407
Burn him! Burn him!

553
00:37:16,786 --> 00:37:18,267
No!

554
00:37:19,285 --> 00:37:22,977
- Stop him.
- Take him! He'll never get out of that!

555
00:37:22,978 --> 00:37:24,445
Take him down!

556
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:29,922
- Take him.
- You are a dead man!

557
00:37:29,992 --> 00:37:31,987
Stop him, you fools!

558
00:37:32,682 --> 00:37:35,100
Charity starts at home, Vaizey!

559
00:37:35,678 --> 00:37:38,085
Not in my home! Kill him!

560
00:37:41,376 --> 00:37:43,759
- Stop it!
- Follow your orders!

561
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,696
I am in command!

562
00:37:51,401 --> 00:37:53,183
Get off my money!

563
00:38:05,238 --> 00:38:06,303
John!

564
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,362
John!

565
00:38:09,363 --> 00:38:10,485
Duck!

566
00:38:13,774 --> 00:38:15,209
Alice, go!

567
00:38:17,903 --> 00:38:20,183
Might have known he was one of yours, Hood.

568
00:38:20,483 --> 00:38:22,312
You torture children!

569
00:38:27,316 --> 00:38:29,803
You said you were no murderer.

570
00:38:29,804 --> 00:38:31,024
Not of men.

571
00:38:31,025 --> 00:38:32,880
This is a devil.

572
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:35,136
- Good answer!
- For your son's sake.

573
00:38:35,137 --> 00:38:37,173
Mummy! Mummy!

574
00:38:45,892 --> 00:38:48,090
Ah, you just couldn't...

575
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,129
Go now.

576
00:38:54,815 --> 00:38:57,164
Oh, not again!

577
00:38:57,534 --> 00:39:00,231
Quick, Mother! Come on!

578
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:10,186
Will someone get this gate open?
In the name of the King!

579
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:26,122
Back to the castle, now!

580
00:40:15,689 --> 00:40:17,135
Get me out of this, Gisborne!

581
00:40:17,274 --> 00:40:18,663
Get off my money!

582
00:40:18,779 --> 00:40:20,051
Get off my...

583
00:40:26,452 --> 00:40:30,294
Thank you for everything you've done,
and for these.

584
00:40:31,075 --> 00:40:33,586
I'm sorry this meant leaving behind your home.

585
00:40:34,674 --> 00:40:37,509
Well, I have gained something
more precious.

586
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:52,892
It's a shame Little John can't go with them.

587
00:40:53,737 --> 00:40:55,577
He knows it's too late for that.

588
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:05,280
We'd best get started.

589
00:41:05,384 --> 00:41:07,282
- We've got a long way to go.
- Yeah.

590
00:41:28,758 --> 00:41:30,818
Luke is a good man, John.

591
00:41:31,257 --> 00:41:32,968
We can make a life together.

592
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,151
You deserve that.

593
00:41:39,061 --> 00:41:40,773
Alice...

594
00:41:44,508 --> 00:41:48,860
You take care of yourself, and our son.

595
00:41:54,995 --> 00:41:57,379
I will always remember.

596
00:42:08,802 --> 00:42:10,179
I...

597
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:14,224
I thought you might like this back.

598
00:42:15,844 --> 00:42:18,019
There's only one, where is the other?

599
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:22,601
I shall never forget!

600
00:42:22,682 --> 00:42:28,175
My father is a comrade of Robin Hood !

601
00:42:34,328 --> 00:42:36,168
Goodbye, my son.

602
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:51,023
Him...

603
00:42:51,024 --> 00:42:52,968
I am proud to know.

604
00:42:53,634 --> 00:42:54,780
You...

605
00:42:55,497 --> 00:42:56,787
I'm stuck with.

606
00:42:57,342 --> 00:42:58,604
Oi, John!

607
00:42:59,853 --> 00:43:01,352
I made you a new staff.

608
00:43:01,665 --> 00:43:02,792
Thanks.
