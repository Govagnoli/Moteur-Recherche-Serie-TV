1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Hospitals are filled with people who just came off 18-hour shifts.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,600
So when a patient dies, it's not uncommon to take them to the morgue yourself,

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,900
then grab a little shut-eye in their bed.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,800
Unfortunately, sometimes you're beaten to the punch.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,500
I'm up!

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,000
You can hardly notice it

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,500
It's actually kinda pretty!

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,000
Jack-ass.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,200
Look who's here.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm never happy when a guy comes back into Elliot's life.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,900
But at least with Sean...it's entertaining.

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,300
Thanks for the lathe.

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,200
I should have warned you that the reason I love that place

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,700
is that they're known for making the hottest coffee in town.

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,200
Yeah, well, no sthweat. You know, lessthon learned.

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Is it me, or do those two seem less awkward around each other?

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,900
See ya!

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,900
Okay, I have some news! We picked a date for the wedding.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,100
Tell 'em Turk.
April 24th !

20
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,700
No, way! Mine is April 25th! 2006!

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,500
Oh, the place I love in Connecticut books up early so what the hell, took a shot.

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,000
One, two, three...

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,200
Crazy!

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,900
Oh, so you've never dreamt about your wedding day.

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,300
Do you, John Dorian, take Marcia Brady to be your wife?

26
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,800
My name is Maureen McCormick.

27
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,300
Marcia, please!
Father, continue.

28
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,300
No, I have not!

29
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,500
By the way, Carla, I know an amazing Journey cover band,

30
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,300
you should get 'em to play at your reception.

31
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,600
Bambi, not everyone loves Journey as much as you.

32
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,900
I don't love Journey.

33
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,500
"She's just a small town girl..."

34
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:51,800
"...Livin' in a lonely world! She took a midnight train goin' aaaanywheeeere!"

35
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,700
Fine, I love 'em.

36
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,200
If you wanna book the band, they're called The Lovin',

37
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,300
Touchin', Squeezin's and they rock!

38
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,600
Took 'em now, thank me later.

39
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,900
After that, the day got worse.

40
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,000
Thanks for giving me a ride down here to see Sean.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,300
I've never been to Sea World. What exactly does Sean do here, anyway?

42
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,100
Probably cleans up the seal poop!

43
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,100
There he is!

44
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,300
Lame!

45
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,800
SCRUBS 3x02 : My Journey

46
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Subtitles by : Sebmov

47
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
Who left this urine here?

48
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,200
Someone's got a secret admirer!

49
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,800
Dr. Kelso? Someone left this urine specimen sitting around.

50
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,100
What's interesting is that the name tag's been ripped right off.

51
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,500
Sweetheart, I think you're confusing interesting with boring.

52
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,200
I can't believe you and Carla set a date.

53
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,000
Yep, it's happening.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
Wedding talk! Ohh, how lovely!

55
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,900
Listen, Hilton sisters: Mr. Quinn in 206 still has a severely shattered clavicle and he needs a surgical consult now.

56
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,300
And, seeing as he's _your_ patient, and _you're_ a surgeon, gosh,

57
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:16,200
I was hoping that if you two hens have an extra moment between choosing centerpieces

58
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,100
and deciding just exactly how you're gonna attach that veil onto Baldy's head,

59
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,400
well, it would just be super-de-duper if you could peek in in there and give him the old lookie-loo; wouldn't it?

60
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Anyway, about this whole setting the date thing: I mean, I'm really psyched for you guys,

61
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,600
it's just gonna be harder and harder for us to hang out, you know?

62
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,600
I mean, you're gonna be married, man! You're gonna have, like, a house!

63
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,900
You know? You're gonna be spending your weekends chasing around little Arturo and Rosaria!

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,900
You mean Tamika and Fuquan?

65
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,300
You should...talk to Carla....

66
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,900
Anyway, this is the end of a major chapter in our lives, ma-- You know what?

67
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,100
I'm gonna take you out tonight.

68
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,600
Yes, sir! We're gonna get some dinner, we'll get a nice bottle of wine....

69
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,100
Sounds like you're asking me out on a man-date.

70
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,700
Turk, why are you so afraid of loving me?

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,800
Up!

72
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,300
Whoa! Do you actually talk to each other?

73
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,500
Elliot, come on, he's just a dolphin.

74
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,900
Because, Bruce, then she would think I was crazy, that's why!

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,600
You know, I am so glad that we're dating again.

76
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,900
Elliot, we're not dating.

77
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,400
Why don't you want to be dating?

78
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:27,300
Th--well--all right.... Here.... Man! Why is everything so much easier with dolphins?

79
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,700
Because you're not trying to date a dolphin.

80
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,100
No. No. Well, not after that big talk they gave us.

81
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,000
Elliot, last time we were together, I thought everything was going great,

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and then out of nowhere you dumped me for your job.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,900
I gotta be honest with you, I've never been so crushed in my entire life.

84
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,600
Really?

85
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,900
That is not something that I'm happy about.

86
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,500
Sean, I was an intern, and if I hadn't made medicine my priority, then I wouldn't have lasted.

87
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,900
But...now things are gonna be different because I'm different. I'm New Elliot.

88
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,100
Well, do you think that, uhh...you think the new Elliot, uh, would like to go to dinner tonight?

89
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,300
I don't know.... She's very busy....

90
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,900
Well, I'm telling you, Laverne, by this afternoon we're gonna find out whose urine this is.

91
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,100
I got a better idea: Why don't you do that.

92
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,800
I'm gonna run across the street and get my tooth fixed so I can stop looking like Larry Holmes.

93
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,500
Carla, you're forcing me to say something that I prayed I'd never have to say again to another woman:

94
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,000
Please, please, please, put down the cup of urine.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
6.50, please.

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,700
6.50? For an egg-salad sandwich?

97
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,200
4.50 for the egg-salad, 2 bucks for the apple juice that you put in a urine container.

98
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,600
Who would do that?!

99
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,200
Just the burger for me.

100
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,100
Mr. Quinn, before I examine your clavicle, let me ask you something:

101
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,700
Do you think it's out of line for me to want to take my best friend here to dinner?

102
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,700
Well, I, uhh....

103
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,800
I mean, this is like the end of an era! Okay?

104
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,700
We've always been known as Turk-&-J.D. Like, when we were in college, people'd be like,

105
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,300
"When are Turk-&-J.D. getting here?" Right? And then in med school,

106
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,200
everyone was like, "When _are_ Turk-&-J.D. getting here?"

107
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,900
We didn't have a car.

108
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,200
The point is, we were together so much, this one Indian girl only slept with him

109
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,500
'cause she thought his last name was "Anjadi".

110
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,600
It was a very good day for me!

111
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,100
See! This is the kind of stuff I'm gonna miss!

112
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,400
The...the reminiscing...the way your breath always smelled of curry....

113
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,300
All right, fine, it's a man-date.

114
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,300
Now, you and I, we're still on for surgery tomorrow, right?

115
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,000
Right. Listen, when you slice me up, make sure you don't mess up my tattoo.

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,500
-- my fiancé, Tracy, would kill me.

117
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,900
I had a tattoo once.

118
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,400
Dude, you got your face painted at the hospital picnic.

119
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,600
I was a cougar! Arrgh-arrgh-aaarrgh! See ya later.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,900
Dr. Cox, does this shade of red make me look like a clown?

121
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,600
No, Barbie, no.

122
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,300
It makes you look like a prostitute who caters exclusively to clowns.

123
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,000
Oh, I'm sorry, that was my mistake.

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,700
I keep forgetting that you're a horrible, horrible person.

125
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,700
Oooh, backbone, Barbie.

126
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,600
Heeee-xcuse me!

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You wouldn't happen to be signing out Mr. Hudson to the on-call resident, would you?

128
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,600
Eee-yeah, why?

129
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,200
He's your patient, he needs a lumbar puncture,

130
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,400
and you can't necessarily count on the on-call resident to do that, now, can you?

131
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,500
It's just that, Dr. Cox, I've got a date with this guy named Sean--

132
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,400
Would you do me a personal favor and excuse me just for one moment?

133
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,100
Yeah?

134
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,100
Dr. Cox, I cannot miss this dinner!

135
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,200
Oh! Barbie, I--I actually see your point.

136
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,900
You should, in fact, go on your little date,

137
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,500
because I have some busy work that's gonna take me over into the vicinity of Mr. Hudson's room,

138
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,600
so I'll just pop my head in there and tell him that he's going to die.

139
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,800
But, if you have a moment between dinner and giving it away for free,

140
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,000
if you could pick up the phone and call Mr. Hudson's wife and kids

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,600
and tell them about, you know, the dying...?

142
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,400
Oh, I know, sugar.

143
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:19,900
This would be just the most terrific place to work on the planet if it weren't for all these sick people. Wouldn't it.

144
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,700
I'm sorry!

145
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,200
I just thought that, as a urine lab technician,

146
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,000
you'd be at least half as interested in urine as I am!

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,400
Hey, you know, I--uh, it's not any of my business, but I think I know whose wizz that is.

148
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,900
I love you!

149
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,400
Okay, go.

150
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,600
Uh, his name is Mr. Freely.

151
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
First name?

152
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,400
I.P.

153
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,900
"I.P. Freely"?

154
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,500
Funny in third grade, funny now.

155
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,100
Listen, Stretch, if you know who this belongs to, I'd 'fess up right now.

156
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,400
Otherwise, I'm gonna grab you by the back of that two-dollar haircut

157
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,600
and force-feed you the sample so you can carry it around all day.

158
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,600
That way, if I ever want it back, all I have to do is point you at a beaker and squeeze really hard!

159
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,900
Now, you got any more funny jokes you gotta tell me?

160
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,900
No, ma'am.

161
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
In a hospital, every day is made up of little battles.

162
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,600
Can I have everyone's attention please?

163
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,200
I officially don't care anymore who peed in this jar!

164
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,500
Sometimes you fight them not because you want to, but because you have to....

165
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,800
Shut up.

166
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,400
Other times you fight for what you want...

167
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,100
Sean, I can't make it to dinner.

168
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,600
...but what you want isn't willing to wait.

169
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,200
Sure, Elliot...yeah....

170
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,100
If you're lucky, there's no battle at all -- everything works out perfectly.

171
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,400
Yo, there he is! For a second I thought you weren't coming, dude.

172
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,800
Hey! Turk-&-J.D.! And J.D.!

173
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,000
Yeah, I'm so psyched we're doing this, man.

174
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,400
So am I.
Todd! Over here, buddy!

175
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
'Scuse me for a second, fellas.

176
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:10,100
I'm gonna go over there and tell that girl my name's "Beer," then I'm gonna offer her some "beer nuts"!

177
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,200
What's up!

178
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,100
Mental five.

179
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,000
You invited The Todd?

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,200
Dude, we left at the same time. I didn't know what to say to him.

181
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,000
But I thought we were gonna, like, reminisce tonight, you know? Get a little deep?

182
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,300
Me too. I'm totally bummed out, all right?

183
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,200
Oh, that was the hottest slap I've ever gotten!

184
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,300
I can't believe I wasn't gonna come out tonight!

185
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,300
Thanks for twisting my arm.

186
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,100
I'm outta here.

187
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,300
Hey!

188
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:52,900
J.D. Come on, man! All right, fine, man! I could have plenty of deep moments with The Todd!

189
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,000
Hey. You think gay dudes get turned on by their own wieners?

190
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,600
Oh, my God.

191
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,100
I wanted to let Turk know exactly how I felt about the way he behaved,

192
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,600
so I decided to throw him Mr. Quinn's chart with a little extra mustard sauce!

193
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,000
Morning, buddy.

194
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,500
I apologize for that. To you.

195
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,300
Not you!

196
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,900
I thought we were friends!

197
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:25,100
Again, not you and me; me and...him. Anyway, have a nice day -- you!

198
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,300
Not you!

199
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,400
Nor you!

200
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,200
Oh, hey, this whole you-leaving-the-room-whenever-I-enter-it thing that you're doing is just...

201
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,000
I love it!

202
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,400
Ever since I got engaged, he's been acting crazier than my fiancee.

203
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,500
Although...Carla is going a little nuts about the dress.

204
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,200
Dude, what's up with Tracy?

205
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,500
Dude! Tracy's a guy.

206
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,100
That'd make you gay.

207
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,700
I am gay.

208
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,100
...Neat!

209
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,400
Never underestimate just exactly how uncomfortable this makes him.

210
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,000
Hello?

211
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,100
Hey, Sean! It's Elliot! Look, I know that last night didn't go exactly as we planned it,

212
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,600
so I thought maybe we could reschedule for tonight?

213
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,000
Look, Elliot, I think this whole thing may be a bad idea.

214
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,700
Just...give me another chance?

215
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,000
Well, I kind of already have plans tonight...

216
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,200
...with this girl, Betty...from work.

217
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,800
Sean--

218
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,700
I'll see ya, Elliot.

219
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,300
Oh, look, see, I did what I had to do,

220
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,700
and I don't need you judging me right now; all right, Betty?

221
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,700
Oh, what do you know.

222
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,200
I'm telling you, it was a clip-board. It came right out of the sky!

223
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,500
I'm sure it did, sir. Woo!

224
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Wendy. Would you watch the phones for me while I go back down to the urology lab?

225
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,500
Sure.

226
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,100
Nurse Espinosa.

227
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,300
I specifically requested that you transfer Mrs. Merchant to the Morning Side Nursing Home.

228
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,100
I'd take her there myself, but then I'd run the risk of bumping into my mother,

229
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,600
and the last thing I need is to have another conversation

230
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,100
about why she shouldn't have to spend her golden years in a bunk-bed.

231
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,000
Now, either do the job we pay you for, or I'll find someone else who will!

232
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,300
Oh: Have a great day!

233
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:43,400
Oh, my God. The janitor's afraid of Carla! How could I use this to my advantage?

234
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,400
Listen, I want you to lay off J.D.!

235
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,500
Stop accusing him of things he didn't do!

236
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,100
...And...bring him a fruit smoothie every day.

237
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,100
¿El gustaria de fresa o guineo?
(Would he like strawberry or banana?)

238
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:04,000
...El...coche... arbol...morado con queso.
(...Purple ... tree ... car ... with cheese.)

239
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,300
¡Mentiroso!
(Liar !)

240
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,100
Feliz Navidad.

241
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,000
I have to learn Spanish....

242
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,000
Whassup?

243
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,900
Oh, nothing -- I just found out my favorite chips cause anal leakage and, oh, I'm not talking to you.

244
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,000
How did you get him to stop talking to you?

245
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,800
I don't get it, man.

246
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,700
All I wanted to do was take you to dinner, and you made me feel like a total idiot.

247
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,100
Wait a minute, I _always_ make him feel like an idiot.

248
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,700
Why you making a big deal about this?

249
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,900
You never tell me how you feel!

250
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,500
Aw, dammit all! I never tell you how _I_ feel.

251
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,600
I'm not talking to you!

252
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,600
Finally!
Thank you.

253
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,900
I don't understand. Ever since I met you it's been like this one-way street.

254
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,600
I mean, I-I-I-I tell you everything, and you tell me nothing.

255
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,100
I don't get it -- what are you afraid of?

256
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Hey, guys. This is my fiancé, Tracy.

257
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,100
This is Dr. Turk, and Dr. Dorian.

258
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,600
Honest to God, I...I love this place.

259
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,900
Soooo...thanks to you, Sean blew me off, but I'm okay.

260
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,300
Old Elliot would have gone into a tail-spin, but new Elliot's just gonna get him back,

261
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,000
because new Elliot is a fixer.

262
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Like, that guy over there -- if his stitches lifted and his spleen ruptured,

263
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,300
I would just go over...and fix them!

264
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,600
My spleen is going to rupture!?

265
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,200
Relax, you're fine.

266
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,000
You know what? I am just going to show Sean that he will always come first.

267
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,500
Gosh, I hate to interrupt this one-gal pep-rally,

268
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,000
there, Barbie, but I give this guy two weeks -- three if you are just terrific in the sack.

269
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,600
Well, then it's three!

270
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,500
I mean: You're wrong!

271
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,100
You know I just, uh, I just got off the phone with Jordan,

272
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,900
who told me that my son rolled over for the first time....

273
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,400
Oh, my God! That's so great!

274
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,900
Big who cares! Not about Jack rolling over for the first time,

275
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,400
but definitely about your reaction to my son rolling over for the first time.

276
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,900
Point being that I missed it because I was here.

277
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,400
You might want to get a pen out and write this down,

278
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:05,200
because here comes the inside scoop: The hospital comes first.

279
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,400
Always.

280
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,500
Always?

281
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,900
Forever and ever.

282
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:20,100
D'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand everandeverandeverandever -- You gettin' this? -- Aaaand everandeverandeverandeveraneverandever....

283
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,900
So I'll pick you up tomorrow, okay?

284
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,800
Okay.

285
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,100
...and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever, andeverandeverandeverandever....

286
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,400
You're not that comfortable with the man-on-man action, are you?

287
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,500
So I'm a little homophobic.... I mean, we all got our stuff, right?

288
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,200
I bet, deep down inside, you're a little racist?

289
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,000
Marrying a black guy?

290
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,400
Dude, how pissed are your parents, honestly?

291
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,800
So, what makes you so uncomfortable? Is it the sex?

292
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,700
Don't get me wrong

293
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,800
I don't love the idea of kissing anyone with a mustache.

294
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,300
That's why I always pretend to have a cold when Carla's aunt comes to town.

295
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:07,000
What really freaks me out, though, is the thought of being that open with another guy -- any guy.

296
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I don't know what it is, I mean that's just the way I been my whole life.

297
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,100
Maybe...maybe it's because I'm scared, you know?

298
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,800
Dude...that's a little gay.

299
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,100
What?

300
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,600
Nurse Espinosa, I feel bad about what happened before;

301
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,000
and so I went and searched through like forty bags of garbage....

302
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,800
And I found the torn off urine label. Also found half a tooth.

303
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,700
Over here, jumpsuit!

304
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,300
Mr. Thomasberg, let's get you to the lab!

305
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,300
Hey, studly! Now, when you were out rooting through the dumpster,

306
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,300
you didn't stumble across your own testicles, did'ja?

307
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,300
Hey, you know that long line of trembling peons that are so afraid of you?

308
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,900
Well I'm not in that line.

309
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,700
Oh, you're not?

310
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,200
No. I'm not in anybody's line.

311
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,600
This is a Chicklet!

312
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,900
I gotta go.

313
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,600
I'm always happy when someone wins a battle.

314
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,700
Because around here, you get your fair share of disappointment.

315
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,000
I guess in the end you have to fight for things that really matter.

316
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Like pride in your work...

317
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,700
...or your friendship.

318
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,300
You know, I'm actually starting to like Journey.

319
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,600
Well you're gonna be very pleased with the next twenty-three songs.

320
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,000
You know, the fact that you're even here for an end-of-an-era celebration is enough,

321
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,300
we don't have to, like, get all deep or anything.

322
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,900
No, I wanna try this, man.

323
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:22,700
Okay, Um.... Ever since Carla and I set the date for the wedding, I started thinking.

324
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,800
You know those lame-ass couples that get engaged but they never actually get married --

325
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,700
they just cruise along year after year, without making any real kind of commitment?

326
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,400
Dude, I wanted to be one of those couples, man!

327
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,200
Hey, Puki, can we get two appletinis, please?

328
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,400
And sometimes, all you can do is grit your teeth and tell the truth.

329
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,300
Hey.

330
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,800
Look, I was planning on coming here and telling you that you'll always come first.
