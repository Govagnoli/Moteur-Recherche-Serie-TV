1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,430
I don't know why, but I feel like Turk and Carla are upset with me.

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,850
Still, I can't be sure, so it's always good to test.

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,100
May I have a pancake please?

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,180
Okay, they're mad.

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,340
I'm pretty sure it's because of my new girlfriend.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,450
She's amazing.

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,040
Don't get me wrong, she's not the warmest person.

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,520
You know, the funniest thing happened...

9
00:00:27,555 --> 00:00:28,210
I'm eating.

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:29,720
Sorry.

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,840
I'm starvin'.

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,240
Wish I hadn't left my wallet at home.

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,780
Mmm, bread.

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,710
Also, the sex could be a little impersonal.

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,850
So that's a no on cuddling?

16
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,710
Still, Turk and Carla's main problem with Neena...

17
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:54,800
is that she's a malpractice attorney who's suing Turk.

18
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,200
Needless to say, I was doing everything I could not to rub the relationship in Turk's face.

19
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,590
I could probably do more.

20
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:02,940
Morning.

21
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,900
I'll see you at the deposition.

22
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,430
I'll try not to spank your lawyer as hard as I spanked him last night.

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,660
Bye!

24
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,280
FYI, there was no spanking last night, okay?

25
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,220
Really?

26
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,050
- Yeah.
- Then this won't hurt.

27
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:21,810
Nope.

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,180
Hit him again baby.

29
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:25,850
Why?

30
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,255
After spreading half a tube of what I thought...

31
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,580
was burn ointment on my butt, it was off to work.

32
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,160
- What smells like Vagisil?
- Nothing.

33
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:37,220
How can I help you?

34
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,430
Remember how I thought Mr. Peterson's back pain...

35
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:41,020
was sacroiliitis and you said it wasn't?

36
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,010
Well, I was right.

37
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,980
Elliot, you should never use scalding hot coffee for a victory sip.

38
00:01:49,015 --> 00:01:50,200
It's a beginner's mistake.

39
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,130
Oh yeah? Well you're ***so something something ***.

40
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,050
Over the past few months Eliot's come into her own as a doctor.

41
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,470
Now that her mentor Molly is gone, she wants to prove it wasn't a fluke.

42
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,760
Attention staff:

43
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,840
One of our hospital's board members is coming in as a patient.

44
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,000
The first doctor to my office gets to treat him.

45
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,340
Of course around here, everybody's looking to prove themselves.

46
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,150
Go.

47
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,400
So Craig, how's your grandmother doing?

48
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,530
Oh, she's much better now, thanks. Turns out it was just...

49
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:05,770
Thanks!

50
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,960
Scrubs épisode 4x10:
My Female Trouble

Script & Timing: Siefaz Pour www. forom. com

52
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,860
J.D., how could you do this to Turk?

53
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,570
You two are so close that I occasionally have nightmares of you running away together.

54
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,510
Where do we go?

55
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,955
One time we went to Aspen.

56
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,100
Oh, I hope it was summer. I'm not that big a skier.

57
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,910
Girls! I want an explanation.

58
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,630
Fine. Turk, tell her our code.

59
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,020
If you haven't had sex in six months, you're not accountable for who you sleep with.

60
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,580
Oh please, when you were single, you were never that desperate...

61
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:51,350
Were you?

62
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,860
Oh that was amazing.

63
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,750
Yes, it was.

64
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,110
We're all God's children in the dark.

65
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,460
Christopher Duncan Turk, you tell him how you really feel,

66
00:04:11,495 --> 00:04:14,330
just like you told me last night, or I will do it for you.

67
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:22,420
Baby! Why does he hurt me so bad?

68
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,160
I want you to stop seeing her.

69
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,120
Fine. But I'm only ending it because friends come first.

70
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,780
Plus, you already had sex with her.

71
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:31,130
Four a half times!

72
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,050
Lata!

73
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,950
Jordan. You're on the board, what is the story on my patient Mr. Summers?

74
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:42,385
Well Stick, I'm going to warn you the same way...

75
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,860
I warn Perry every time I have more than three scotches.

76
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,140
Prepare to have your ass grabbed!

77
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,440
That's disturbing in like... eight different ways.

78
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,360
Barbie, the guy's a sexist pig. He's gonna eat you alive.

79
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,180
Look, I'm not the same doctor I was four years ago.

80
00:04:55,215 --> 00:04:56,860
I'm smarter, I'm more confident...

81
00:04:56,895 --> 00:04:58,485
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

82
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,850
Just skip the rest of your "I'll show you speech"

83
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:03,430
and just walk away in a huff. I'm very busy.

84
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,960
Thank you!

85
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,065
So should we start this deposition,

86
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,100
or do you boys just want to hand us a big bag of money?

87
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,880
Big bag of money...

88
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,100
You aren't going to freeze up around her again, are you Ted?

89
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,490
No chance. I'm drugged up.

90
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,195
Plus, if I concentrate,

91
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,420
I think I can control the excessive flop sweat I get the second she speaks.

92
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,370
Ted, you ready to get started?

93
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,180
Whenever you're ready, Neena.

94
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,190
First off, I'd just like to say that these charges...

95
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,740
We should take a short recess.

96
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,480
Believe me, you're better off.

97
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,350
I agree.

98
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,550
Now, Mr. Corman is contending that the shoulder surgery he received ruined his tennis serve.

99
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,930
I'd like to start by asking Dr. Turk if his diabetes...

100
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,100
could have affected his performance in surgery.

101
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,360
You're diabetic?

102
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,395
Yes. I told you that.

103
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,480
I thought you were joking.

104
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,930
How is that funny?

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,400
Well, it's a very serious disease. And I don't like you.

106
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,430
How do we even know he plays tennis?

107
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,330
Look at him. He's awful! You are awful!

108
00:06:16,365 --> 00:06:17,370
Wait for the serve.

109
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,010
We're settling.

110
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,100
Hey, I want you to know that I still think you're a great doctor.

111
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,080
And I've been talking to my rabbi a lot lately about me finally getting circumsized.

112
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,960
It's not a religious thing, it's... it's more for the ladies.

113
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,310
What?

114
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,770
Hey Neena.

115
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,540
God help me, I'm going to miss that smile.

116
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,300
I think because of the whole Turk situation we should probably stop seeing each other.

117
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,390
No.

118
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,130
You can't just say no. No is the answer to a question.

119
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,880
And I clearly wasn't asking a question, Neena. I was making a dramatic statement.

120
00:06:58,915 --> 00:07:01,930
And I'm sorry, but that statement was goodbye.

121
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,950
You know, one of us is going to tire eventually.

122
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,900
So how are we feeling Mr. Summers?

123
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,480
I feel like my ex-wife is standing on my chest.

124
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,480
And not the pretty one.

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,430
The fat one that had all my kids.

126
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,850
Fantastic! I'd like to start by...

127
00:07:29,885 --> 00:07:31,335
Listen, Goldilocks.

128
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,445
Unless the next three words out of your mouth...

129
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,690
are some combination of sponge, bath, and my big white ass,

130
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:39,010
I'm not interested.

131
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:45,330
Now, how about you be a nice little nurse and go find my doctor.

132
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,905
Actually sir...

133
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,740
His name is Elliot Reid.

134
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,200
So, what's the word?

135
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,070
This guy any good?

136
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,580
Oh, he rocks!

137
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,270
Baby, you know if my malpractice insurance goes through the roof,

138
00:08:03,305 --> 00:08:05,570
you're going to have to take a step down lifestyle-wise.

139
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,280
I live in a tiny apartment with my husband, his best friend,

140
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:11,140
and their dead stuffed dog. What's the step down?

141
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,530
Hey come on!

142
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,070
One of the most amazing things about you is that you never let anything beat you.

143
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,470
- Yeah, I am pretty impressive.
- Yes you are.

144
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,160
Now don't you let anything else get into that beautiful head of yours.

145
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,310
Okay?

146
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,150
What could get into this man's head, baby? Huh?

147
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,760
Tough day, huh?

148
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,490
You wanna talk about it?

149
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,550
Neena, it's over.

150
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,100
No it's not.

151
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,535
In fact, I find myself oddly turned on...

152
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,690
by your timid baby horse standing up for the first time style of lovemaking.

153
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,900
First of all, thank you.

154
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,040
Secondly, I tried to be reasonable.
Now if you want to see my dark side,

155
00:08:47,075 --> 00:08:48,470
you're going to see my dark side.

156
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,665
A- tickletickletickletickle...

157
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,565
A- tickletickletickletickletickle...

158
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,430
Yet another strong moment for you?

159
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,550
Okay, fine, why don't you just tell me how this ends?

160
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,980
You won't break up with me, you will betray your friend.

161
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,090
What is this, some kind of lawyer mind trick? It's not gonna happen!

162
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,760
- Sit down.
- I won't, I'm leaving.

163
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,480
You're going to have sex with me.

164
00:09:05,515 --> 00:09:06,920
I'll do nothing of the sort.

165
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,550
And as the ultimate act of betrayal,

166
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,870
you will do it on the very same sweat and tear-soaked table where I crushed your friend.

167
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,275
Oh, I hate a dirty table.

168
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,020
You love a dirty table.

169
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,570
God help me, I do. I do love a dirty table.

170
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,680
Okay, Mr. Summers. Your EKGs came back...

171
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:29,340
and Dr. Reid liked what he saw.

172
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,420
When the hell am I getting out of here?

173
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,260
Dr. Reid thought you might ask that and he had an answer for you.

174
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,510
Shut your cakehole!

175
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,790
He also said for you to stop paying off orderlies to sneak...

176
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:39,350
you cheeseburgers, you big load.

177
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,190
Wow, he's old school. Like me.

178
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,770
Hey! That belongs to Dr. Reid!

179
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,430
So you and Reid...

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,020
Yes. We're lovers.

181
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,810
Red hot lovers.

182
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,620
I'm guessing he's married.

183
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
She doesn't understand him like I do.

184
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,100
I love this guy.

185
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:00,370
Not like I do.

186
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,015
Hey, Turk's kind of in a dark place right now,

187
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,760
so stay away from him, okay?
Nothing personal, you're just an awful human being.

188
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,000
Of course. But, uh, we kind of crossed paths already.

189
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,130
Life is pointless Gandhi, and I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

190
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,020
The only thing more pointless than life itself is being a doctor.

191
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:25,795
I mean, bottom line, you spend eight years and 200Gs

192
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,590
trying to get through med school and what do you have to show for it?

193
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,980
I'll tell ya. A diploma on your wall, and a bullseye on your back.

194
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,530
And you reminded him that people are basically good.

195
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,495
People suck. They suck. And make no mistake about it,

196
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:43,590
even sweet little old ladies are looking to bend you over a chair in court.

197
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:44,810
Come on.

198
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:46,980
We covered people.

199
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,300
And I know you would never do anything to ruin his innocence.

200
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,755
You see, there's a compartment in the hat.

201
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,480
So the stinkin' rabbit is actually in there the whole time.

202
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,800
Right?

203
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,700
People pretty much hear what they want to hear, okay?

204
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,590
What did you do?

205
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,350
Hey, excuse me. My son is interested in becoming a doctor,

206
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:12,030
and I thought maybe you could tell him what it's like.

207
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,480
I'd love to! I would love to!

208
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,250
Do you have a dog, Bowl Cut?

209
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,890
Well, I want you to find a pile of its best work and roll all around in it.

210
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,310
See, that's how it feels to be a doctor. Because here's the dirty little secret.

211
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,870
People don't want your help. They want your dignity, they want your pride,

212
00:11:30,905 --> 00:11:32,720
but mostly, they want your money.

213
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,510
Good luck in med school.

214
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,860
Oh! The next time you see a magic show,

215
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,550
the bunny was in the hat the whole time.

216
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,260
Peace out!

217
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,020
You are so dead.

218
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,420
You can only keep the truth hidden for so long.

219
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,140
Enough is enough. I want to meet this Dr. Reid!

220
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,140
No problem!

221
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,470
Frick!

222
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,310
Turk, wait!

223
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,400
Let's sit down and talk about this.

224
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,410
And when the truth comes out, it doesn't set you free as much as you'd hope.

225
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,900
Hey buddy!

226
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,140
Especially if it involves betraying your best friend.

227
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,990
Did we win?

228
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,515
Wait, hold on Turk!

229
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,610
Haven't you ever heard of keeping your enemies closer?

230
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,415
I was just keeping her closer! Turk!

231
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,480
Hey Gandhi! Gandhi, I think we should talk. What do you say?

232
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,590
Sure, Dr. Cox and I were feeling guilty.

233
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,760
But if Turk didn't want to talk about it, we were in the clear.

234
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,110
May I have a word with you two?

235
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,590
Okay, who wants to be me?

236
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,070
Craig, you're probably still mad at me. Anyone else?

237
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,470
Dr. Reid. At your service.

238
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,150
Okay, that's a no for Todd. Isn't there anyone here that I can trust to be me?

239
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,400
Hello. I'm Dr. Reid. Dr. Elliot Reid.

240
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,230
I'm a doctor.

241
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,160
What is the matter with you two?

242
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,500
J.D., you said you were going to break up with Neena.

243
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:08,565
I know! Believe me,

244
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,910
the whole time we were having sex I was thinking about Turk.

245
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,090
That came out wrong.

246
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,260
And you!

247
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,490
Why do you want everybody in this hospital to be as miserable as you?

248
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,490
How could you not get this?

249
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,720
What does misery love?

250
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,470
- Alright, look...
- Company!

251
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,380
Misery loves company!

252
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,300
Misery loves company...

253
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,570
Oh God...

254
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,650
Okay, sure sure. Maybe we did screw up, just a pequito, but come on.

255
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:38,230
We're definitely not the ones you want to be mad at.

256
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,400
Oh yeah, then who?

257
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,640
Hiya fellas!

258
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,870
Summers, I think we can save your foot.

259
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,730
- It's his heart.
- I know that.

260
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,450
We're concerned about your ticker.

261
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,570
Ah, yes. Yes yes.

262
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,240
Well, your paper script looks good.

263
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,610
But, I'm going to have to listen to that heart of yours.

264
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,820
Well, I'm afraid I was wrong. We're going to have to take that foot.

265
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,910
My talk with Carla gave me the courage to take a stand.

266
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,570
After all, misery loves comradery.

267
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:51,545
Look, Neena...

268
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,250
If you talk about ending our relationship again, I'll punish you.

269
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,460
Punish me? How?

270
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,815
You know what, no, this is crazy.

271
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,690
I am not going to get your name tattooed on my ankle, okay?

272
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,380
Enough is enough! Alright?

273
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,090
A man has to have his limits.

274
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,770
Let's get out of here. Come on!

275
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,330
And that's when I realized I would never be strong enough...

276
00:15:12,365 --> 00:15:14,560
to break Neena's hold over me. I needed help.

277
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,370
I needed someone who was even scarier than she was.

278
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,370
I needed a real witch.

279
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,400
Someone must have left this here from Halloween.

280
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,200
God, Dr. Cox is going to go off on me.

281
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,270
It's going to be worse than the time my brother Barry caught me reading his Playgirl magazines.

282
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,710
Don't you mean Playboy?

283
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,590
No.

284
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,040
So you're saying that your brother's...

285
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:40,665
Yes.

286
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,905
Has he actually told your family that...

287
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,660
- No.
- But everyone's positive that he's...

288
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,450
Do you think he and another guy have ever...

289
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:46,480
No more questions.

290
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,540
Elliot, if you can handle that sexist dirtbag in there,

291
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:51,870
you can certainly handle Perry.

292
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,040
Why are you being nice to me?

293
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,950
Okay, Perry occasionally talks to me at home.

294
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,135
And he told me that you don't need him as much anymore,

295
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,470
and it annoys the hell out of him, which of course gives me endless enjoyment.

296
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,475
Don't go backwards.

297
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,145
Own what you did with Mr. Summers.

298
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,670
You are so much stronger than all the other idiot residents around here.

299
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,635
Really?

300
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,120
Jordan? I need you to break up with somebody for me.

301
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,850
Really.

302
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,110
Hey. There's no pie here.

303
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,870
Oh my God! Oh, you two are going to kill me!

304
00:16:26,905 --> 00:16:28,560
Nobody's going to kill you.

305
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,980
Hi, I'm Dr. Nobody.

306
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,620
Oh, I see. This is your Hippocratic Oath? Schoolyard threats?

307
00:16:33,655 --> 00:16:35,150
Seriously, is there no pie?

308
00:16:35,185 --> 00:16:36,240
Look, Turk.

309
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,660
I know you feel like you did right by him, but you have to acknowledge...

310
00:16:39,695 --> 00:16:42,090
that Mr. Corman here feels like you let him down.

311
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,260
You know what? I don't feel that way.

312
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,900
I know you did the best job you could.

313
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,800
But there's something that you should know about me.

314
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,770
People hate me.

315
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,710
But in tennis, they're forced to interact.

316
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,360
So for three hours, two Sundays a month,

317
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,080
I have friends. You know what I mean?

318
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:08,260
So what you're saying is that even though you think my husband did a great job,

319
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,765
you've decided to crush his spirit by...

320
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,430
putting a permanent black mark on his medical record over a tennis game?

321
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,460
I fear I've said too much.

322
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,820
Okay, this woman is horrifying, so don't panic.

323
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,720
- I'll be fine.
- I was talking to myself.

324
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,710
Oh, there you are. Go get in the backseat of my car and lie down on the floor.

325
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,560
Okay.

326
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,650
Neena, a word?

327
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,440
Oh, it's so on.

328
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,640
You got something to say? Say it.

329
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,850
The thing about strong women... If you call them out,

330
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:52,750
they're going to give you a piece of their mind.

331
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,920
I should have known, Barbie.

332
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,960
Hell, you have been impersonating a doctor since the first day you got here.

333
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,255
Look, I did what I had to do to treat this guy.

334
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,590
And as far as me being scared about you telling him that I'm full of crap?

335
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,860
Hey Jerkwad! I'm Dr. Reid!

336
00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:07,685
What?!

337
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,440
Oh, and by the way. I had a little chat with your wife.

338
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,790
I know I'm in your head.

339
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,320
It took me three years to move in and I am not moving out.

340
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,655
Here's what's going to happen.

341
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,600
You're going to drop this lawsuit because it's wrong and you know it.

342
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:23,200
But also because if you don't,

343
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,105
I'm going to pound the plaid right off that shirt...

344
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,720
and make it so that the only way you'll be able to eat pie is through a straw.

345
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,490
You come in here and walk around like you're the queen bee.

346
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,150
Guess what, Missy.

347
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,610
This is my house.

348
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,920
You and Mr. Chestless here are over.

349
00:18:37,955 --> 00:18:39,960
So move on! Cause if you don't,

350
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,490
I'm going to turn your little lame liason into a threesome, starring yours truly.

351
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,710
And I don't kiss nice.

352
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,300
And just like that we all knew who had won.

353
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,490
Ouch.

354
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,610
Yeah!

355
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,100
Okay. Fine, it's over.

356
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,780
I'm free?

357
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,890
Hey you. Go get in the back of my car.

358
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,210
Awesome.

359
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,030
Wow. Thanks, Jordan.

360
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,540
I'll see you around.

361
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,110
Not so fast. You're my bitch now.

362
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,290
Jordan's making me stretch out her new jeans.

363
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,410
Cry me a river.

364
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,710
You know what Gandhi's wife made me do this afternoon...

365
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,830
because I supposedly crushed his spirit?

366
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,730
What?

367
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,580
Ever since the surgery I've been serving lefty.

368
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,840
It's a little unpredictable, but I'm getting some good heat.

369
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,550
Can't wait to see it.

370
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,050
Hit you on the fly! Fifteen-love!

371
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,040
Turk, I'm sorry about Neena.

372
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,670
It's okay, man. She's a woman. I understand.

373
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,230
And the truth was, he did understand.

374
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,775
No matter how much we like to pretend otherwise,

375
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,720
strong confident women will always have the power over us.

376
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,380
Whether they're fighting for respect,

377
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,740
fighting for their man,

378
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,360
or even just fighting for the hell of it.

379
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,450
Strong women make all guys feel the same way.

380
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,350
Jordan looks mad, I should go.

381
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,710
I have to pick up Carla's dry-cleaning.

382
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,700
Well, what do we have here?

383
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,700
Oh, no.

384
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,600
I heard from a reliable source that you want to live in dumpster.

385
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,120
I can arrange that. Yep, I know just the right neighborhood.
