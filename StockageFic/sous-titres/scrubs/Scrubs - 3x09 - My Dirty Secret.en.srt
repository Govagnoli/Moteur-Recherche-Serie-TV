1
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:06,924
Relationships can be defined by
how long people have been together.

2
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:09,092
I am so late, I don't
even have time to eat.

3
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,844
Whether you've been
together for a few weeks...

4
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:11,929
Do you wanna have sex?

5
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:13,305
Yes.

6
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,228
...or together for three years.

7
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:19,811
Baby?

8
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:20,479
Hm?

9
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,689
What do you think about getting
pregnant right after the wedding?

10
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,236
See ya!

11
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:32,115
Carla! You can't ask a guy
that while he's driving!

12
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,242
My bad.

13
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,080
Yes, it was your bad, Carla.

14
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:47,379
...Or whether you've been
together for more than five years.

15
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,299
Why don't we ever have sex?

16
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:57,349
I find it a little hard to feel sexy seeing as I
passed a human being out of my body six months ago.

17
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,979
Hey, lookit, I had front seats to that
bloodbath, and it hasn't affected my sex drive.

18
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,275
Oh, no, no, no, no, I got that when you asked the
lactation nurse if she needed help getting things started!

19
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:07,317
Right.

20
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,111
You know, Perry, a lot of men
would be happy just to have a baby.

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,447
So, you're currently on the pill, right?

22
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:14,909
Yes! Will you please, just drop it!

23
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,786
Okay. 'Cause, you know, you've gotta
take it the same time every day.

24
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:19,079
Right.

25
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:24,418
When I was in high school, I went to Europe for a month and I forgot to
take my birth control pills, so I took like thirty the day I got home.

26
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,126
What happened?

27
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:29,837
Elliot! Your homecoming date is here!

28
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,717
Uh.... Stall him!!!

29
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:38,473
Nothing.

30
00:01:39,602 --> 00:01:44,521
Oh, Todd, you simply must sample one of
these tea buns my mum sent over from Sussex.

31
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:50,861
Up high two times. One's for "buns", one's
for the "sex" part of Sussex! Come on!

32
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,905
Whoa, an American high-five!

33
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:55,824
How perfectly vulgar.

34
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:56,450
Yeah.

35
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,161
I think the Janitor's
pretending to be British.

36
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,079
You mean Klaus, the German guy?

37
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,123
Guten Tag, Doug.

38
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:04,416
Thanks!

39
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,003
That means "nice haircut."

40
00:02:08,423 --> 00:02:09,213
No it doesn't!

41
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:10,839
Mind your own beeswax.

42
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,801
I guess around here, you have
to be prepared for anything.

43
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,679
Mmm, Britishy!

44
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,102
...Especially if you're dealing with
a patient who needs emergency surgery.

45
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,563
Uh, where's Dr. Wen? This
patient's ready to go.

46
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:29,691
He just called. He got in a car
accident, so he can't make it.

47
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,152
Don't you play with me,
intercom lady! I will find you!

48
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,947
Relax. Dr. DiStefano is on-call.

49
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,989
Thank God.

50
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:42,871
We just dodged a bullet because, look, I am nowhere
near ready to perform this type of procedure solo.

51
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:48,287
I would have been terrified, you guys would have sensed it,
and it would have been a horrible experience for all of us.

52
00:02:48,714 --> 00:02:52,339
Dr. DiStefano is stuck in
surgery. It's all on you, Dr. Turk.

53
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,550
Big piece of cake! Who's with me?

54
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,885
Come on!!!

55
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,146
Oh, yeah!

56
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:13,235
The news of Turk's successful surgery had
spread quickly. He was the stud of the hospital.

57
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,864
Who's the black surgeon you know that
just repaired an artery like a pro?

58
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:20,950
Turk!

59
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,660
That's right, baby.

60
00:03:23,247 --> 00:03:27,416
Who is the doc that won't cop
out when no attendings are about?

61
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,500
Turk!

62
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:30,586
Right on.

63
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:32,424
Turk!

64
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,297
What?

65
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,800
Wow. You must be dancing
on the wind right now.

66
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,303
...That sounded straighter in my head.

67
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:44,516
Dude, today I had to sink or swim all on
my own; and guess what? A brother swam.

68
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,476
That is so fabulous!

69
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,269
What is wrong with me today!?

70
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:49,897
Dr. Wen!

71
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,607
I was scared when you didn't show up,

72
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,277
but...your car accident turned out to be
the best thing that's ever happened to me!

73
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,612
My wife broke both her legs.

74
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,906
Heh. Still.

75
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:04,077
Maybe it's just Buddha's way of telling
her to slow down a little, you know?

76
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,584
Oh, are you a big man? What?

77
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,794
Yeah. Man, I hope you haven't eaten yet,

78
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,673
because I'm about to force-feed
you a can of my homemade WHUPASS!

79
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,967
Miguel doesn't speak English, baby.

80
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,183
...WHUPASS!

81
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:27,559
Thanks, sweetness!

82
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,896
Hahahaha! Whoa!

83
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:33,941
Hey, look, Gandhi,

84
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:37,194
now just because you broke out
your little Fisher-Price surgery set

85
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:41,698
and somehow managed to _not_ kill somebody for
once, doesn't mean you're queen of the world.

86
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,242
You think you could do better, old man?

87
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:44,701
Watch and learn.

88
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:06,473
How's that taste? Is it delicious? Oh?

89
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,601
Oh, Lord. My back.

90
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:10,769
Are you okay?

91
00:05:11,147 --> 00:05:15,357
Come on! I'm simply posing so your
boyfriend can get a picture of me

92
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:19,361
for his "People Who Make Me Feel
Like a Little Girl" scrapbook. Haaah!

93
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:20,445
Let's go.

94
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,698
Ohhh, God!

95
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,536
You know, Nigel, I'm
twenty-five percent British.

96
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,998
Really? I'm one hundred
percent not interested!

97
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,250
Ohh! Classic Nigel!

98
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:39,339
So, I've been asking around, and apparently
you're known as one of three people:

99
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:43,802
Nigel, the Brit; Klaus, the dim-witted
German -- yes, I said "dim-witted --

100
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:47,139
or a simple, good-natured
stutterer named Efrem.

101
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,307
Am I the only one that
knows the real you?

102
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,018
Who says this is the real me?

103
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,187
Perhaps this is?

104
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:54,980
Or this.

105
00:05:55,314 --> 00:06:01,278
Hey, Klaus. In your country, how come Hamburg and Frankfurt,
they have nothing to do with hamburgers or hot dogs?

106
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,115
Why is your Lake Titicaca not
filled with boobs and poop?

107
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:08,619
So, what do you do?

108
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,120
Oh, I work at a hospital.

109
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,915
I'm a resident, which is actually
still kind of like a student.

110
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:16,168
Well, not a student as in, like, dorm rooms and
pizza runs and crazy, drunken kissing parties

111
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,380
-- which I know for a fact still go on in Radiology
-- but more of a student in the sense that--

112
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,424
Excuse me. Dude, she's got a boyfriend.

113
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:23,633
Thanks, man.

114
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:27,261
Why didn't you just tell
him you were a doctor?

115
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,849
I don't know.... I guess I just still
don't feel like a doctor, you know?

116
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,435
I mean, that whole thing with
Turk today really got me thinking.

117
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:37,314
Like, I've ran codes before, but there's always
been someone right there ready to bail me out.

118
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:40,859
Like, I've never had that one
defining, sink-or-swim moment.

119
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,277
Have you?

120
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,697
Yeah, but I didn't, like,
make a big deal out of it.

121
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:53,664
I was just made partner at my law firm.
I drive a Beemer. And this is my wife.

122
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:57,543
Oh, well, this is Mr. Booker.
He's alive because of me.

123
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,420
I thought you said there'd
be some bitches here?

124
00:07:00,627 --> 00:07:02,338
We just got here! Look around!

125
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:08,262
We actually had a fun night...until
he urinated all over my rental car.

126
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:18,814
So you're saying your mom made you pancakes this morning, and
you didn't even know that it was pancake day in the cafeteria?

127
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,440
You get outta here!

128
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,109
And the
craziest thing--

129
00:07:21,647 --> 00:07:23,819
No, I'm serious, Nervous
Guy: Get outta here!

130
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,198
Why won't you admit you hurt your back?

131
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,867
Carla, come on!

132
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:33,579
Back injuries are for 80-year-old guys
named Norman who have pants up to here,

133
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,295
nose-hairs down to here, and who start
every sentence with the very elegant

134
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:40,586
Uh-huh.

135
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:45,424
Oops. You dropped your badge.

136
00:07:47,124 --> 00:07:49,636
Your move there, ... Norman.

137
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,356
That's impressive.

138
00:08:28,517 --> 00:08:30,177
You wanna know what
the janitor did today?

139
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:30,844
No!

140
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,012
Bambi, you idiot.

141
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:36,225
I love 'The Fugitive'. Who would you rather
sleep with, Tommy Lee Jones or Harrison Ford?

142
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:37,476
Harrison Ford, hands down.

143
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,897
...But you were probably talking
to Carla. I'm having such a gay day!

144
00:08:42,297 --> 00:08:42,731
"Day"?

145
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:46,068
Yeah! It's just this whole janitor
thing has thrown me for a loop.

146
00:08:46,084 --> 00:08:47,768
Danni, we should watch
the movie in Turk's room,

147
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:50,666
because he's gonna keep talking about the
janitor, even though we begged him not to.

148
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,574
I won't, sweetie, trust me.

149
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:54,201
Let's go.

150
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:58,789
I just wanna know what kind of freak needs to
spend all day pretending to be somebody else!

151
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:06,171
Uh, listen, this is ____unit number 23. I got a possible
sighting of Richard Kimball on northbound ______.

152
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:08,549
Kimball!

153
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,570
Janitor!

154
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:17,125
Mr. Moran, I don't want
to make any promises,

155
00:09:17,126 --> 00:09:20,886
but, uh, your cellulitis is resolving nicely,
and I think that you'll be out of the woods soon.

156
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:26,984
So tell me something: How did an old geezer like me
end up with the prettiest young doctor in the place?

157
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,857
It's actually just a
simple rotation system

158
00:09:28,858 --> 00:09:31,114
based on when your shift started and
the last patient that you've seen--

159
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:34,283
Sweetheart, I'm just
paying you a compliment.

160
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,411
I have to go.

161
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:40,747
Thanks for saying I'm pretty.

162
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:47,588
Mm. Oh, yeah. Oh,
hello...sweet...oh, sweet couch.

163
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,879
I've been thinking about
what you said this morning.

164
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,165
And you're right, we have not
been having enough sex lately.

165
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,892
Turns out yes, yes we have.

166
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,770
No, we haven't. And tonight, we're gonna
do it the way you always fantasized about.

167
00:10:04,112 --> 00:10:06,481
Laying down in a big tub of ice?

168
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:12,279
Standing up, against the wall, you
holding me up. What do you say, Romeo?

169
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,950
Sometimes the moment you've been waiting
for comes at the most inopportune time.

170
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,827
Let's do this!

171
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:19,661
Mmmmm.

172
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,792
Arggghhh! Oh, yeah! Ohhhh, yeah!

173
00:10:27,611 --> 00:10:30,765
Sometimes the moment comes when you feel like
you've been waiting for it your whole life.

174
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:34,185
You just have to hope that no one beats
you in there and steals your thunder.

175
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:38,847
'Cause if they do, well...you're just gonna
end up standing in the corner, watching.

176
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:40,432
He's in complete heart block.

177
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,350
Get those transcutaneous pads; push one
milligram Atropine. Where's the cart?

178
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,017
Elliot!

179
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:42,559
Yeah?

180
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:43,936
Get outta the way! They're
trying to get through!

181
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,865
Okay, start a line.
Hyperventilate, here we go.

182
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,151
Not going anywhere.

183
00:11:00,468 --> 00:11:02,955
Dr. Dorian, you can't
imagine how grateful we are.

184
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,205
Let me ask you something:

185
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:08,204
Who's the cool doc you call when you
want to save your husband, Paul? J.D.!

186
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,841
It's from 'Shaft'? Come on,
how could you guys not get that?

187
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,183
Yeah.... That's our 'Citizen Kane'....

188
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,751
Anyway, thanks again.
You're a real hero.

189
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:23,435
Oh, please, I put my pants on one
leg at a time, just like you guys.

190
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,272
...Except, after I put my pants on, I
save your husband's life! Oh, no he didn't!

191
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,732
Ohh, Smelliot! What's the happie-haps!

192
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,871
Whoa. I was in a sex
coma. How'd you sleep?

193
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:46,250
Great!

194
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,337
Ohh, and Perry? I know I asked you
to be more sensitive when we do it,

195
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,000
but I was just hoping you
wouldn't curse as much.

196
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,514
I mean, to actually cry
during sex, what's that about?

197
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,847
I guess I just love you so...much...?

198
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,600
What is wrong with you? Is this
because I called you "Smelliot"?

199
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:10,239
Because I can't believe you
haven't heard that before.

200
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,982
J.D., I don't care if you call me that.

201
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,067
Hey, everybody! She's
cool with "Smelliot"!

202
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,529
Oh, so he can call you "Smelliot" but
I'm not allowed to call you "Vagina Face"?

203
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,697
Not the same, Todd!

204
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:19,656
HMPH!

205
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:23,634
Look, J.D., that was my patient; I was
one step behind you, and you knew it.

206
00:12:23,961 --> 00:12:25,144
You stole my moment.

207
00:12:25,404 --> 00:12:29,249
This isn't about moments, it's about saving
lives. Elliot, when I put my pants on--

208
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,876
Yeah, I don't want to hear
anything more about your pants!

209
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,028
Look, we both know
what this is about --

210
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,940
from the second I started dating
Sean, you obviously weren't happy.

211
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,307
I thought that would change when you met
someone, but I guess I've moved on and

212
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,070
you're just acting like you have.

213
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:44,806
Uhh, okay. Prepare
for a storm-off. Hmph!

214
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:52,481
Turk, the night we got engaged, you
said you couldn't wait to have kids.

215
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:54,942
How can you hold that
against me? You were naked!

216
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,819
So I should just disregard
everything you say when I'm naked?

217
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,667
You know, that's not
actually a bad idea?

218
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,544
We can call it The Naked Rule; and it
should probably apply retroactively, so, um,

219
00:13:05,544 --> 00:13:07,595
you can get yourself to
the airport next weekend?

220
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:08,664
Fine.

221
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,381
Gotta love The Naked Rule!

222
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,346
Say, Carla...boy, you...you look nice.

223
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,681
You're pathetic.

224
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:32,331
How's about we skip the insults and you do something
helpful like prop me up, or throw on a skirt.

225
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,098
You're an actor.

226
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,170
You're a fireman! What are we doing?

227
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:45,086
Game over, Klaus. I saw
you in 'The Fugitive'.

228
00:13:45,578 --> 00:13:47,315
Ohhh, yeah, yeah.

229
00:13:47,315 --> 00:13:52,311
I was in a Harrison Ford movie, but, you know what, I
chose this life instead 'cause it's a little more glamorous.

230
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,619
Hey, champ. There's some vomit on
the back steps with your name on it.

231
00:13:57,465 --> 00:14:00,082
Well, that's my cue. Action!

232
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:06,722
Cut!

233
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:14,421
Young lady, would it brighten your day any if I told you
I thought you were the best damn doctor in this hospital?

234
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:17,692
Mr. Moran, why couldn't
my father be more like you?

235
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:20,703
I mean, if I had a dollar for every time I got
depressed and my dad didn't make me feel better--

236
00:14:21,575 --> 00:14:25,832
Actually, he _did_ give me a
dollar every time I got depressed.

237
00:14:26,246 --> 00:14:31,069
By the end of junior high, I already had a hundred and
seventy bucks.... And then got mugged and lost it all.

238
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:34,382
But, by the end of that night, of
course, I was back up to a dollar.

239
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,671
Sweetheart, why don't you tell
me what's really upsetting you.

240
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:41,548
Him.

241
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:43,300
Can you believe her?

242
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:47,513
She says I beat her to that code because I still have feelings
for her. I don't even think about her that way anymore.

243
00:14:47,602 --> 00:14:49,765
Dude, you can't _not_
think about her that way.

244
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:50,390
Whatevah!

245
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:51,975
Okay, think about her right now.

246
00:14:57,943 --> 00:14:59,476
Now think about her and Sean together.

247
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,779
Now think about her and me together.

248
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:11,827
That's what's up.

249
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,375
Kissing her all three times, except
the third time you were a black guy?

250
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,262
Yeah....

251
00:15:18,738 --> 00:15:19,962
Let me do it. Let me do it.

252
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,175
Okay. You are entering a new phase
in your life; why are you fighting it?

253
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,219
I'm not--I'm not
fighting anything.

254
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:29,738
So, even though you
have a full head of hair,

255
00:15:29,738 --> 00:15:32,890
you still take Propecia because
you like the way it tastes?

256
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:37,980
You know, the other day I found
a gray hair in my happy trail.

257
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:41,066
Is that the patch of hair that goes
from your belly button down to your pe--

258
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:42,317
It is, indeed.

259
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:46,363
So? You have a gray happy trail! A
lot of women find it distinguished.

260
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:48,473
Carla, I have a
six-month-old child.

261
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:52,220
I'm gonna be one of those weird old
guys who brings my son down to the park,

262
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,638
where everybody is like, Hmm, is
he the dad? Is he the grand-dad?

263
00:15:55,638 --> 00:15:58,067
Is he the grand-dad's
grand-dad? And, oh, my God!

264
00:15:58,067 --> 00:16:03,419
Why is he pushing a traffic cone on the swing while
his five-year-old little boy is in the mud crying?

265
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,839
Is--is he taunting the little boy?
No! He can't even see the little boy!

266
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,715
And, now look, he's actually taking the
traffic cone, putting it in the mini-van,

267
00:16:11,715 --> 00:16:18,254
and driving away while the little boy cries and the
traffic cone sits quietly and watches 'Finding Nemo' on DVD.

268
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:24,624
Look, for what it's worth,

269
00:16:24,624 --> 00:16:31,208
instead of marrying a long time ago, I'm marrying a guy who
probably won't be ready to have kids for another ten years!

270
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:35,563
That'll make me like
thirty...grghrghrgh.

271
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,873
More like forty-rghrghrghrgh.

272
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:39,459
But you know what?

273
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,528
It's okay.

274
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:46,756
Because I couldn't handle marriage until
now. And I knew you when you were younger,

275
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,804
and you would have been a horrible dad.

276
00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:50,376
Now? We're both ready.

277
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,224
Do you...do you think
that my son will like me?

278
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:56,141
Oh, God, no.

279
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:56,808
Oh.

280
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:03,753
Dr. Reid, I need to get
Enid a birthday present.

281
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,515
Ahh! When's her birthday?

282
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,647
I think it was last week.

283
00:17:07,745 --> 00:17:10,489
Um...well, a scarf is always nice.

284
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:14,866
That's perfect. It's simple; it's
elegant; and it'll hide her turkey neck.

285
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:18,787
Mr. Moran is coding.

286
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:20,082
Dr.
Reid---

287
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,045
At the end of the day,
medicine's pretty competitive;

288
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:36,209
so I guess you have to do
whatever's right for you.

289
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:39,189
Go.

290
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,332
Okay, let's start a central line;

291
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:43,768
we just have to get the crash cart.

292
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:44,988
Have we established an airway?

293
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:45,993
It's obstructed.

294
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:49,528
We're gonna need to do an emergency trach.
Get the scalpel and the trach. kit. Go on.

295
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:54,364
Watching Elliot in there, I
couldn't help but be impressed.

296
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:56,721
Hurry! Faster!

297
00:17:56,441 --> 00:17:56,985
She was amazing.

298
00:17:57,392 --> 00:17:58,385
Let's go, you guys! Come on!

299
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,784
Unfortunately, in medicine, even
if you do everything perfectly...

300
00:18:06,688 --> 00:18:08,136
...there are still no guarantees.

301
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:13,427
Sorry.

302
00:18:25,163 --> 00:18:26,190
Evenin' governor!

303
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,013
Hey, what's up your bum?

304
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:33,275
You know why I wanted that
to be you in 'The Fugitive'?

305
00:18:34,421 --> 00:18:37,642
Because it would mean you used to be
a guy who had dreams and ambitions;

306
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:40,058
and even though things didn't
work out the way you'd hoped,

307
00:18:40,058 --> 00:18:42,181
at least it would explain why
you are the way you are and...

308
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:46,233
make you human. But instead, it turns
out you're nothing more than a...

309
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:48,817
a jerk who just likes to mess
with people for no reason.

310
00:18:51,848 --> 00:18:52,371
"Kimball!"

311
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:58,917
You tell anybody, I'll kill ya.

312
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:01,475
Goodnight, Efrem!

313
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:05,180

Goo-goo-goo-goodnight...doctor.

314
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,388
Some people hide from
who they really are.

315
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:15,072
Hey, baby. Todd and I are going to the arcade,
so I'ma get some quarters out your purse.

316
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,284
I'm old.

317
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,703
Others eventually accept who they are.

318
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:24,907
Yeah, well I'm older. Now would you
please get me down to my damn car?

319
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:31,027
Sure, let's get your big Irish ass to your
car so nobody knows that you hurt your back!

320
00:19:31,948 --> 00:19:33,294
Let's not worry about my back!

321
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:40,264
But sometimes it's the tough moments that
help you realize who you've finally become.

322
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,704
You work in there?

323
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,143
Mm-hmm.

324
00:19:45,432 --> 00:19:46,053
What do you do?

325
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:47,940
I'm a doctor.

326
00:19:48,332 --> 00:19:49,429
You shouldn't smoke.
