1
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,760
Doctor's comin'!

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,300
What the...?

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,010
Frank, you idiot. Your bed's down the hall!

4
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:24,190
I know! I love you...

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,030
Ohh!

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,630
You ever get the feeling our patients pretend to be sicker when we're around?

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,840
Oh, yeah. You know Mrs. Wilson back there?

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,250
She made her spleen pretend to rupture, and then she pretended to die.

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,960
Got me again, there, Mrs. Wilson!

10
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,570
You know, Elliot, since I broke your heart, I've held my tongue every time you've been a wiseacre.

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,907
But now that you slept with my brother, we're even.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,409
So if you bring sarcasm my way, baby, prepare to be stung!

13
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:51,235
- J.D...
- So's your face.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,765
That doesn't even make any sense.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,170
"So's your face" always makes sense.

16
00:00:54,205 --> 00:00:55,245
J.D., that's stupid.

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,140
So's your face! I'm on fire! Helloooo!

18
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,235
Perry, are you familiar with Sacred Heart's community service program?

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,625
Bobby, lately I've noticed you don't listen to a single word people say,

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,140
so my reply to your question is I think you're the world's biggest jackass...

21
00:01:10,175 --> 00:01:11,300
and I look forward to your death.

22
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,210
Well, you must not be familiar with it because you're the only staff member...

23
00:01:14,245 --> 00:01:17,500
not to have completed his 24-hour mandatory community service.

24
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,160
Consider yourself suspended until you do! Oh, and I'm never dying.

25
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,640
Oh, guh!

26
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,530
Crab claw.

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,050
Did you just pinch my arm fat?

28
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,310
Yeah, does it make you mad?

29
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,110
I don't know, it was kind of a...

30
00:01:33,145 --> 00:01:34,010
Crab claw!

31
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,160
What are you doing!?

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,600
I'm moving to Milwaukee for a psychiatric fellowship, and by pinching your arm I'm making you angry...

33
00:01:38,635 --> 00:01:40,680
instead of feeling overwhelmed with sadness that I'm leaving.

34
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,930
You're leaving?

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,080
Don't cry, you're gonna make me cry.

36
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,040
They're here! Ignite the tractor beam!

37
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,070
I should go, that's my 2 o'clock.

38
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,580
I can't believe she's leaving!

39
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,030
Hospital just lost its second-hottest employee.

40
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,580
Don't think you can drool all over her just because you rank me number one.

41
00:02:01,615 --> 00:02:02,940
Baby, Nurse Tisdale's number one.

42
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,610
You g.. you gotta be single to be on the list.

43
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,110
You actually rank the women of this hospital by their appearance?

44
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,630
Calm down, Twelve.

45
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,680
Yes, top twenty!

46
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,410
Look, you guys, we should really do something for Molly, like throw her a party.

47
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,240
I don't know, Elliot. Molly and I really aren't that close.

48
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,360
Okay, a lot happened between that moment and this one. I should explain.

49
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,900
Elliot did end up throwing Molly a goodbye party.

50
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,460
This is amazing, Elliot, thank you.

51
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,360
I also had a piñata made to look exactly like you, but I don't know what happened to it.

52
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,220
Whoa, it's gettin' late.

53
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,080
Big Dog wants some candy.

54
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,860
Yes, baby, Molly is attractive.

55
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,230
But she doesn't hold a candle to my Puerto Rican princess!

56
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,770
For the last time, Turk, I'm Dominican.

57
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,065
My nephew Ryan is so cute. He's six.

58
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,005
I was content to lay low and flirt in the corner.

59
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,395
See, the most important thing about hospital get-togethers...

60
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,470
is to make sure you don't do anything people will be talking about the next day.

61
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,040
Wow, look, flaming shots!

62
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,690
...goes through like the whole day that he's grown up! Oh my God, I love it.

63
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,110
Will you excuse me a moment?

64
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,495
PUT ME OUT! PUT ME OUT!

65
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,530
All right! Stand back, everyone! I'll handle this!

66
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,210
DOUG! WHY!?

67
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,970
The sinks are broken! The sinks are broken!

68
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,520
Hot! Hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot!

69
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,970
So your nephew is six, huh? That's a crazy age!

70
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,160
After the fire marshal closed down the bar, we took the party back to our place.

71
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,470
Sorry I'm late. Player had a date. Anybody want some chocolate?

72
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,970
Eventually things wound down.

73
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,500
Some people went home...

74
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,740
Some just went to bed...

75
00:04:08,775 --> 00:04:09,510
'Night.

76
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,270
And that's how Molly and I ended up alone on the couch,

77
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:17,150
watching that unbelievably romantic scene from'16 Candles'.

78
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,770
The Donger need food!

79
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,770
No, not that one! This one.

80
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,410
Happy birthday, Samantha.

81
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,210
God bless Molly Ringwald. And this Molly.

82
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,240
Ah, the hell with it! God bless Mollys everywhere!

83
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,610

85
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,950
Dude, now that I have adjusted your fuel valve, your scooter is going to fly!

86
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,470
Speaking of things that are fly, I made out with Molly last night.

87
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,810
I know that was kind of a lame segue, but I've been with you all morning...

88
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,600
and you've yet to use the words "make" or "out. "

89
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,030
I hope it doesn't bother you.

90
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,370
Nah. How was it?

91
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,400
Weird. His tongue was freezing.

92
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,100
I gave her the ol' ice tongue.

93
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,910
It's easy to do, you just have to be really smooth.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,880
He kept running to the kitchen to put ice on his tongue.

95
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,410
I always hated ice tongue. And sometimes his lips seemed so greasy.

96
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:24,295
I'm telling you, Turk. Olive oil.

97
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,300
Dude, just because it's good on salad doesn't mean it's good on your lips.

98
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,860
I wuv your wittle outfit.

99
00:05:32,895 --> 00:05:33,810
Now listen, you.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,260
Riding in an ambulance takes care of my community service,

101
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,210
so I'm doing two shifts back to back... I'm gonna...

102
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,640
...knock this whole thing out in a single day. Besides, how bad can it be?

103
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,755
Howdy, partner! Name's Denise Lemon.

104
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,755
Looks like we got ourselves a little ambu-date...

105
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,490
that's "ambulance" and "date" put together. I got a million of those!

106
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,350
I am loving this!

107
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,585
Hey, uh, hon, before you hop in there,

108
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,810
could you do me a little favoroony and check the windshield wiper?

109
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,880
I think I got something caught up there. Yeah.

110
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,480
No problem. I got it.

111
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,260
I always get the newbies with that one!

112
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,900
Got you! You know it!

113
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,870
When they strap me in the chair, please let them know the murder was just.

114
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,250
Hey, Elliot, I was making out some prescription orders... and speaking of making out...

115
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:21,460
She already told me, J.D.

116
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,960
Oh, damn, I was afraid that was gonna get out.

117
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,580
Does anybody else know that I totally made out with Molly? Up here!

118
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:32,140
Now that you made out with my best friend, that makes us not even again.

119
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,440
So go get me some cotton balls and a toe separator... mama needs a pedicure! Heh.

120
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,080
Elliot, once you're even, you can't just go back to being not even. That ain't new, girl!

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,830
Admit we're not even or I'll make you pay.

122
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:48,010
Heh, yeah, now that we're friends and there's no chance of us ever having sex again,

123
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:50,440
there's really not a whole lot I "need" from you, okay?

124
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,380
So g'head and give it your best shot.

125
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,590
Andele, Juan!

126
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,960
Doctor, doctor, gimme the news I got a...

127
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,475
Yeah, I'm not a big car-singing kind of guy.

128
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:08,380
Aww, "Bad case of loving you," Perr! Come on, where's the fun?

129
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,935
You know, you don't get this kind of rush on a normal job.

130
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,540
You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't, you don't. You know what I'm saying?

131
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,670
You're saying you don't.

132
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,080
Well, Perr, sometimes you do.

133
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,900
Are you looking at my boy, Davey? He's ten there; he'll always be that age to me.

134
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,785
Can't take my eyes off of him.

135
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,450
I don't blame you, he's gorgeous! He looks just like his mama!

136
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,760
I'm kidding!

137
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,120
I wish we had more time together, I do.

138
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,160
Boy, you wouldn't believe when we started school?

139
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,010
First day he cried, second day I cried, third day we both cried...

140
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,010
not'cause of school,'cause we had a go-cart accident.

141
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,420
Think it's how my nose got bent...

142
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,860
Who knows?

143
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,370
Nose knows. I love words. Don't you love words?

144
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,837
I like "strangle. "

145
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,479
There she is! Thanks, Juan!

146
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,595
Hey, Molly. It's your last night, you wanna grab a beer or something?

147
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,955
J.D., I have to tell you something.

148
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,550
Oh, no, did someone you know die from beer?

149
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,930
No one can die from beer.

150
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,870
Hey, yo, J.D., toss me a beer, man.

151
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,630
Comin' at you, Shinski!

152
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,290
People can die from beer, Molly. Shinski didn't, but our friendship did.

153
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,390
J.D., you just don't have that edgy mean streak that I'm attracted to.

154
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,050
You were saying?

155
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,920
Dude, what the hell!?

156
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,030
Oh, that's what's up. Go about your business!

157
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:34,120
Look, I'm sorry, but I'm attracted to damaged, dysfunctional people, and you're just too normal.

158
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:40,110
Sometimes all it takes is a slammin' hottie to make you dig down deep and discover who you really are.

159
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,800
My emotional journey began at five years old when I walked in on my parents having sex...

160
00:08:43,835 --> 00:08:47,150
in a position my father would later playfully describe as "the jackhammer. "

161
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,845
I have a mentor that verbally abuses me every chance he gets,

162
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,640
and no matter how much I try, I can't stop constantly narrating my own life.

163
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,040
At that very moment, I feared I had divulged too much.

164
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,460
Molly, I'm narcissistic, I'm pessimistic, I'm obsessive, I'm insecure.

165
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,195
And I am so afraid of intimacy that every one of my relationships...

166
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,960
is a journey of self-sabotage that inevitably ends in a black vacuum of shattered expectations and despair.

167
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,020
Wow.

168
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,540
Boy, I tell you what, there, Jordan, I'm sure glad that shift is...

169
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,410
Perry! I was just telling Jordan here about that sneezing attack that I had this morning.

170
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:23,410
Was it fourteen or fifteen sneezes?

171
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,430
Yes, Perry, was it fourteen or fifteen sneezes?

172
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,150
What are you doing here, Denise?

173
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,925
Well, I heard that you were doing back to back shifts,

174
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,260
so I pulled a couple of strings so that we could get the old band back together!

175
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Perry! You've always wanted to be in a band!

176
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,660
Get out of town! I just came up with that band thing!

177
00:09:38,695 --> 00:09:40,070
Get out of town, Perry!

178
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,830
Well, laissez le bon temps rouler. Translation: Let the good times roll.

179
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,730
See, that's what they say in New Orleans, The Big Easy.

180
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,730
You know, that was my nickname in high school... New Orleans.

181
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,290
No, I'm just kidding, it was The Big Easy. I was a huge slut!

182
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,230
I was, I did everybody.

183
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,490
Much better without the icy tongue.

184
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,100
I'll remember that.

185
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,440
Why would she lie?

186
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,280
Should we get out of here?

187
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,590
D'you think you can handle it?

188
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,440
No. But you won't know until after.

189
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,690
You just need to clear it with one person first.

190
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:12,890
Just tell me who!

191
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,800
N o.

192
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,150
Oh, what's the matter, J.D., freezer got your tongue?

193
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,430
That doesn't even make any sense!

194
00:10:24,465 --> 00:10:25,490
So's your face!

195
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,690
Dammit! Walked into that one!

196
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,150
The key here is to not seem desperate.

197
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,430
Please, Elliot! Please let me have sex! She's leaving tomorrow!

198
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,860
It's simple, J.D., I'll give you the OK if you just admit we're not even.

199
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,770
I am sorry, but that is one thing that will never happen.

200
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,000
Fine, we're not even.

201
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:56,660
Thank you.

202
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,490
But Molly just left, so you have to call her at home!

203
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,290
I'm not gonna do that. But, I will write you a note.

204
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,770
J.D. may fornicate with anyone.

205
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,680
Okay, Sasha, let's see what your new engine can do!

206
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,580
So, little Jack's a baseball fan, eh?

207
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,295
He's two and he can't talk yet.

208
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,480
You know what you should do? You should get him some baseball cards!

209
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:33,370
I got my son, Davey, a Ken Griffey Jr. card? Carries it with him wherever he goes.

210
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,030
Never liked the gum, though.

211
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,750
Gum's a weird word, isn't it? You know?

212
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,490
Do you ever notice some words, you say'em enough, they don't even sound like words anymore?

213
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:47,260
Gum... Gum. Gum. Gum! Gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gummmm. Gum gum gum...

214
00:11:47,295 --> 00:11:50,060
Oh, happy day. She's blown a fuse.

215
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,160
I swear to God, Jordan, I can't do it again.

216
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,870
Perry, it's just one more shift. Just tune her out and she'll eventually leave you alone.

217
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,515
Consider it done.

218
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,320
...gum gum gum gum gum. Gum.

219
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,920
Relax! At most, you have a minor concussion.

220
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,530
Now I just wanna check your pupils, okay?

221
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,575
Doug, that's for...

222
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,650
- ... ears.
- Ears!

223
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,870
Right! I'm not stupid!

224
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,490
Where are my clothes?

225
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,960
I sent them to the dry cleaners!

226
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,280
Doug!

227
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,830
You responsible for this head blood?

228
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,440
Look, here's the bottom line:

229
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,930
I am currently in possession of a note that would give me permission to have sex...

230
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,760
with a very beautiful woman, but I have no way of getting to her apartment.

231
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,120
Then what are we waiting for.

232
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,750
Get in.

233
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,070
Come on! Let's go! Go, go, go, go!

234
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,550
What are you doing!?

235
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,900
It's been four years.

236
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,930
How do you not get how this works?

237
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,900
Hello?

238
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,950
Turk, it's me!

239
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,820
Hang on, I'm doing my diabetes test. Ninety eight, is that a good number?

240
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,265
Yes! It's good! You surgeons are idiots!

241
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,780
Oh, I'm the idiot, huh? Well, guess what you were wrong about!

242
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,860
Carla's Dominican!

243
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,375
All right, come on up, Perr! Let's get this show on the road!

244
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:40,140
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and hang out back here, just kinda get acclimated with this area.

245
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,660
Oh, okay.

246
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,255
Hey, funny tidbit...

247
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,340
Sorry there, D., can't really hear you back here.

248
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,020
Ohh. Message received!

249
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,100
Hey, can you hear me now?

250
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,950
Hey, it's like that commercial. "Can you hear me now?"

251
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,020
See, now, the only downside is that I can't hear you, so I guess I'll just have to talk for both of us.

252
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:08,370
So back to that tidbit. Now, that's a funny word. See, I know what a bit is, but what's a tid?

253
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,620
Tid... Tid tid tid tid tid tid tid tid tid tid. Tid. Tid. Tid. Tid.

254
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,190
J.D.! We're over here!

255
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,370
COMING!

256
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,700
I don't understand what the big deal is. It's just sex.

257
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,980
It's not just sex.

258
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,590
It's sex with Molly!

259
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,170
Any guy would kill to have sex with Molly. Hell, I'd kill to have sex with Molly!

260
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,750
That's it.

261
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,520
Sorry, dude.

262
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,770
Where were you?

263
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,310
I was treed by that coyote!

264
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,750
You got your phone?

265
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,250
He took it.

266
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,940
What now?

267
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,775
I can't run in this gown, it's too loose!

268
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,430
I can't run in these jeans, they're too constricting!

269
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,365
Yeah, this is much better!

270
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,975
I agree, but my legs are cramping!

271
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,230
You spent too much time crouching in that tree, didn't you!

272
00:15:06,265 --> 00:15:07,450
I was kneeling on a nest!

273
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,090
Just think of Molly, man!

274
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,830
J.D., where are you?

275
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,000
J.D.! Hurry!

276
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,060
Now that's what I'm talkin' about!

277
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,710
It's okay.

278
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,710
Hey, Perr. I just saw an adorable interracial gay couple.

279
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,350
Aw, just precious.

280
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:43,430
Lookit, enough of the squawk-box, all right? And just keep your eye on the road, whatta you say?

281
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,540
All right, no more squawk-box.

282
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,640
But, Perr, don't sweat the roads. I know'em like the back of my hand.

283
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,530
Ohh, Perr... I think I'm hurt.

284
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,620
I'm not badly hurt, just a tidbit.

285
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,370
Elliot, you gotta help me! We're in front of Molly's apartment, but her name isn't listed anymore.

286
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,330
It's either... 4G or 5G.

287
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,430
J.D., this is ridiculous, it's 4 o'clock in the morning.

288
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,170
Even if you catch her, she's leaving for the airport in like ten minutes.

289
00:16:20,205 --> 00:16:22,300
That's perfect! That'll leave us five minutes to cuddle!

290
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,715
Hi, is Molly here?

291
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,800
It's not my wife, is it, Debbie?

292
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,510
Dorian. Turkleton.

293
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,230
If you come in, you have to take your shoes off.

294
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,770
Sorry, wrong apartment.

295
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,600
Konichiwa.

296
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:47,400
Dude, she's outside. She's about to get in the cab!

297
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,950
Oh my God. I'll never get down there before she leaves! This is the worst moment of my life.

298
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,530
Or is it the greatest moment of your life?

299
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,430
You're right. Gimme that gown!

300
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,670
Go get her, buddy!

301
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,800
Hey, this isn't that scary.

302
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,020
Molly!?

303
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,370
Hey!

304
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:25,290
Sorry about your collarbone. Say! I've got a community service form here, would you sign it for me?

305
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:26,620
Sure thing, Perr.

306
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,580
So, you gonna come by and visit me later?

307
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,890
Denise, that's not very likely. And here's why:

308
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:37,320
All you do is talk, talk, talk talk, talk, talk, talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk.

309
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:41,450
And when you're not talking, I'm betting you're thinking about talking. I mean,

310
00:17:41,485 --> 00:17:43,270
can I ask you a personal question?

311
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:47,810
Have you ever had a thought that you didn't immediately verbalize?

312
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,270
Well, I don't know. That's a tough one, Perr.

313
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,500
Oh, look, the window's open again! You can see the moon!

314
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,600
Oh my God.

315
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:01,190
What happened in your life that made you so needy that you've got to fill...

316
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:03,670
every waking second by babbling on?

317
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,450
Fine, don't visit. My son will come.

318
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,000
And now we are right back on your son again.

319
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,510
I'll be honest with you, I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to get your voice out of my head.

320
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,010
It is a very real concern.

321
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,710
Hey, did you leave anything in the ambulance?

322
00:18:21,745 --> 00:18:23,240
Only my will to live, why?

323
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,950
Then I guess this is your partner's.

324
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:31,160
See, now, I got my son, Davey, a Ken Griffey Jr. card? Carries it with him wherever he goes...

325
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,480
He's ten there. He'll always be that age to me...

326
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,880
I wish I had more time with him, though.

327
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,350
What happened to your son, Denise?

328
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,900
He died in an accident.

329
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,000
Paramedics were amazing, though.

330
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,450
That's actually the reason I became one.

331
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,450
I really miss him, you know?

332
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,130
Thanks a lot.

333
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:31,150
Molly, I think you should stay. I'm off today, we'll have an amazing time, you can leave tomorrow.

334
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,940
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

335
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,150
Well, maybe this'll change your mind.

336
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,310
How's it going?

337
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,940
Pretty well. Nice landing.

338
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:45,710
Thanks.

339
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,460
J.D., I think this note's for you.

340
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,670
I think the easiest way to lose something is to want it too badly.

341
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,180
Take care.

342
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:15,190
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

343
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,010
Of course, it doesn't help if your friend is a diabolical genius.

344
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,560
Still, when you come across a person who's lost something that really matters,

345
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,550
you have to answer the call.

346
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,720
Ooh, he's just such a cutie pie! Look at that!

347
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,785
Have you ever had cutie pie, Perry?

348
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,480
- No,'course not.
- I like it à la mode.

349
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,230
I'm kidding! I know it's not really pie!

350
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:43,070
But I'll tell you, if it was really pie I would eat it up, I'd gobble it, because I love pie!

351
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:45,300
Oh my God! You're my favorite!
