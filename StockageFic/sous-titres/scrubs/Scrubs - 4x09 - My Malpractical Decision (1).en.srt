1
00:00:06,605 --> 00:00:07,271
Hey, J.D.

2
00:00:07,306 --> 00:00:09,455
Just preppin' Mr. Hovey
for brain surgery.

3
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:12,804
Doug, Mr. Hovey's having
rotator cuff surgery.

4
00:00:15,776 --> 00:00:17,080
What'd you do to my hair?

5
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:18,032
Nothing.

6
00:00:18,656 --> 00:00:19,969
Cool halfro!

7
00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:20,912
WHAT?!

8
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:24,472
Oh, thank God.

9
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:26,023
It's a good thing
he couldn't go left,

10
00:00:26,058 --> 00:00:28,932
because the last thing you need in
the I.C.U. is someone flying off the handle.

11
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:31,241
Shore it up, people.
Neena Broderick's in the building.

12
00:00:31,497 --> 00:00:33,296
WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,046
As tactless as it was to yell that in a room
of very sick people, Ted had a point.

14
00:00:39,328 --> 00:00:42,929
See, Neena Broderick is the scariest
malpractice attorney in the city.

15
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,491
She seemed to create problems
where there were none.

16
00:00:52,526 --> 00:00:55,183
Grandma was a hundred and two.
It was her time to go.

17
00:00:55,832 --> 00:00:58,393
You killed her, and you're
gonna pay for it!

18
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:00,197
Shake this place up!

19
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,939
And for God's sakes,
get Murphy out of here!

20
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,125
Don't worry, Doug,
you're a good doctor.

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,392
I know!

22
00:01:09,809 --> 00:01:11,484
Hey...
what are you guys going?

23
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,265
Hurry!

24
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:13,243
You guys...

25
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:14,767
Guys?

26
00:01:21,637 --> 00:01:23,014
My leg!

27
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:30,935
How long do I have
to stay up here?

28
00:01:31,323 --> 00:01:34,820
Just until I finish pretending
to read the newspaper.

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,490
Hm! Apparently there was some
sort of election held recently.

30
00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:44,673
Or we could just
ask him to leave.

31
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:48,447
Come on, Doug.
Let's go get some coffee.

32
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,096
- Miss Broderick.
- Bob.

33
00:01:54,485 --> 00:01:57,010
Oh, hi Ted,
how's your wife doing?

34
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,827
Oh, that's right, I forgot
you freeze up around me.

35
00:02:00,862 --> 00:02:03,619
Okay. Well, I'll see you
in court on the eighteenth.

36
00:02:03,978 --> 00:02:07,156
Ted's possum-like defense mechanism
was actually quite brilliant.

37
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,459
Hello, Neena.
We got divorced, actually.

38
00:02:11,494 --> 00:02:14,958
I'll see YOU in court
on the eighteenth!

39
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:19,990
Everybody around here had the
sense to stay under the radar when

40
00:02:20,025 --> 00:02:21,615
Neena Broderick was around.

41
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:23,378
Well, almost everybody.

42
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:27,772
I'm on a scavenger hunt, and I need to find
a black-haired, soulless bottom-feeder.

43
00:02:29,202 --> 00:02:30,486
Oh, hi Neena.

44
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:33,994
How ironic. Because what I need is
a burned-out, permed-up doctor

45
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,082
with a god-complex and
a drinking problem.

46
00:02:36,182 --> 00:02:38,469
Don't listen to her. Most guys
would kill for those curls.

47
00:02:38,504 --> 00:02:41,657
Straighten up, Newbie, and I mean
that in every sense of the word.

48
00:02:41,692 --> 00:02:43,671
This woman is pure molten evil.

49
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:44,737
Got it.

50
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,378
How do you even look at yourself in the mirror
knowing that you are ruining American medicine?

51
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:52,490
Frivolous lawsuits, scare
perspective, doctors-

52
00:02:53,784 --> 00:02:56,282
Don't you even
feel the least bit-

53
00:02:57,109 --> 00:03:00,970
Perry, if you want me to shed a tear about
the current status of our medical system,

54
00:03:01,005 --> 00:03:04,561
I'm gonna have to borrow a scalpel and dig it
deep into my arm, because here's a secret:

55
00:03:09,118 --> 00:03:12,108
I don't care about anything
that you think about anything.

56
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:17,293
J.D., big news!

57
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:19,557
Guess what my new
cell phone number spells!

58
00:03:19,592 --> 00:03:22,394
Why'd you get a new cell phone number?
Your old number spelled "kufunninapuh".

59
00:03:22,429 --> 00:03:25,214
Yeah, well this one's
916-CALL-TURK.

60
00:03:25,249 --> 00:03:27,123
Yeah, so now all you
gotta do is call Turk!

61
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:30,613
How'm I supposed to remember that?
I'm begging you, stick with "kufunninapuh"!

62
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:33,372
Come on, man, this is the best thing that's
ever happened to me besides getting married.

63
00:03:33,407 --> 00:03:34,311
She's not here.

64
00:03:34,346 --> 00:03:36,361
It's the best thing that's
ever happened to me!

65
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:38,501
But "CALL-TURK"
is eight numbers.

66
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:40,417
I know, actually
it's just CALL-TUR,

67
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:42,882
but I'm hoping people
will dial the "K" anyway.

68
00:03:43,402 --> 00:03:45,358
I'll always dial
the "K" for you.

69
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:48,307
You're a good friend, and
that's why I did this for you.

70
00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:54,516
No, wait, there's more.

71
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,620
- Awesome!
- Oh, no, no, no, no,

72
00:04:02,655 --> 00:04:04,263
it's not over yet.

73
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,834
So you're the one.

74
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,358
Come here, you
big brown bear!

75
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:18,946
And just like that, it
turned into a great day.

76
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:21,225
- I'll take the lead on this one.
- It's all yours.

77
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,480
Mr. Steel. First name, Man of...

78
00:04:23,515 --> 00:04:24,925
You're done.
Mr. Steel,

79
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,074
you passed out, so we're gonna go ahead
and watch you closely for arrhythmia,

80
00:04:28,109 --> 00:04:30,005
but we don't foresee
any big problems.

81
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:32,675
Hi, daddy.

82
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:44,268
Episode 4.09
My MalPractical Decision

83
00:04:44,303 --> 00:04:46,285
Subtitles by nColas for www. forom. com
with scripts from www. mopnt. com

84
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:50,542
I gotta go.

85
00:04:50,577 --> 00:04:54,230
If I'm around that sea hag for more
than ten seconds my throat closes up.

86
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:55,804
Page me if you need me.

87
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,133
Need you? Perry,
please, I got this one!

88
00:04:59,414 --> 00:05:00,530
Are you Dr. Dorian?

89
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:05,145
She was all over me!

90
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,370
I have a few questions
about my father.

91
00:05:07,594 --> 00:05:08,935
Your father has syncope-

92
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,844
Perr, I'm back in!

93
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,631
You see, Neena, the heart is
like a big inflatable house.

94
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:18,019
Now, on the bottom floor are
these two rooms, or "ventricles".

95
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:20,404
Now, these ventricles
- or "rooms"-

96
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,263
Syncope in the setting of severe LV
systolic dysfunction indicates

97
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:25,704
a high risk of arrhythmia.
So the best course of action would

98
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:27,625
probably be an
implantable defibrillator.

99
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:29,276
I'm a medical
malpractice attorney.

100
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:32,763
And I am much, much
smarter than you.

101
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:35,377
They're like rooms.

102
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,573
Okay, missy. Knowing damn
sure that you'll sue us

103
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:41,901
if the slightest thing should go wrong
with this elective procedure,

104
00:05:42,316 --> 00:05:44,914
we're gonna go ahead
and elect NOT to do it.

105
00:05:45,184 --> 00:05:46,333
You can't do that.

106
00:05:46,368 --> 00:05:47,195
Really.

107
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,023
Bob?

108
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,582
Hospitals can refuse treatment
on a non-emergency patient.

109
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:54,237
Here's a list of places we can
refer you to. Thanks for playing.

110
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,676
Give that a good look.

111
00:05:58,366 --> 00:06:02,014
Like I said.
Rooms.

112
00:06:06,955 --> 00:06:09,104
What kind of person would
do something like this?

113
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:12,354
That's a very unfortunate
hand placement for you.

114
00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:16,753
This is a very
common hand size!

115
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:19,415
Gotta go.

116
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:23,582
Yeah, and Kelso wants me to keep
hiding Doug until that attorney leaves.

117
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:24,480
Isn't that ridiculous?

118
00:06:24,515 --> 00:06:26,895
Elliot, the man tried to
electrocute me an hour ago.

119
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,691
All I care about is whether
or not this twitch goes away.

120
00:06:30,352 --> 00:06:31,878
You should take Doug
down to the morgue.

121
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:34,327
The worst he could do there is
bring somebody back to life!

122
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:38,525
Carla, when I became chief resident,
I wrote a pledge to myself.

123
00:06:39,118 --> 00:06:40,463
And do you know
what it said?

124
00:06:40,884 --> 00:06:43,384
It said "Dance like
nobody is watching".

125
00:06:43,762 --> 00:06:46,842
Which I do, -constantly- in my
living room, with the shades closed

126
00:06:46,877 --> 00:06:48,310
just in case
somebody is watching.

127
00:06:48,345 --> 00:06:50,507
But it also said not to
hide problems away.

128
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:52,594
So, no, I'm not gonna go and
hide Doug down in the morgue.

129
00:06:53,308 --> 00:06:57,992
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to give this to
someone, or if I took this from someone, but...

130
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,083
I got a bag of blood.

131
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:02,180
So, Doug,
this is the morgue!

132
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:08,667
It's cute, the little toe-tag.
Like a present.

133
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,352
Mr. Corman, a nurse said
this was a full-on emergency.

134
00:07:13,496 --> 00:07:15,074
I just came from the courts.

135
00:07:15,109 --> 00:07:17,578
It's been six weeks since
you did my shoulder surgery,

136
00:07:17,613 --> 00:07:20,622
and my serve still has
no pop. No zip, I tell ya!

137
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:24,160
You have to understand that
this is a healing process.

138
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:27,167
Who invited Nurse Twitchy?

139
00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:29,091
Okay, Mr. Corman, for the-

140
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:30,632
How many visits is this?

141
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:31,669
Twenty-seven.

142
00:07:31,704 --> 00:07:34,718
Okay, for the twenty-seventh time,
we're gonna ask you to do your therapy

143
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:35,716
and just be patient.

144
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:38,954
I have a singles match against
my mother on Monday.

145
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,058
I lose to her,
I lose my pride.

146
00:07:43,858 --> 00:07:46,239
I'm assuming these Q-Tips
are complimentary.

147
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:50,377
Dr. Dorian!

148
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:54,855
Okay, just stay calm. You can handle this.
She can't be that much of a ball-buster.

149
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:58,176
One

150
00:07:59,073 --> 00:08:00,954
singular sensation.

151
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:03,556
Every little step she takes.

152
00:08:04,996 --> 00:08:05,649
One

153
00:08:06,732 --> 00:08:11,443
thrilling combination.
Every move that she makes.

154
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:17,119
One smile and suddenly nobody else

155
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:18,073
will

156
00:08:18,338 --> 00:08:20,653
do;

157
00:08:20,688 --> 00:08:25,155
You know you'll never be lonely with you

158
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,443
know who.

159
00:08:31,363 --> 00:08:32,464
Dr. Dorian?

160
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:33,901
I'm wearing a cup!

161
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,898
Thanks for the crotch update.

162
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,048
Look, I'm just worried
about my dad.

163
00:08:39,205 --> 00:08:41,376
And that's when I saw her
for what she really was

164
00:08:41,841 --> 00:08:43,802
just a patient's
scared daughter.

165
00:08:44,415 --> 00:08:45,992
Can somebody
please talk to me?

166
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,465
Elliot, I know everyone thinks
I'm this huge screw-up,

167
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,321
but I just want you to know that
I'm gonna turn it around!

168
00:08:57,189 --> 00:08:59,064
Doug! This is a quarantined area!

169
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:03,398
It's okay, Doug. You probably
just didn't see the signs.

170
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:04,966
Signs?

171
00:09:06,341 --> 00:09:09,634
- Oh, man, I'm hopeless!
- Come on, Doug.

172
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,142
Sorry again, guys.
My bad.

173
00:09:17,177 --> 00:09:19,486
Get outta here!
Get out!

174
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:22,352
Oh my God!
What an idiot!

175
00:09:22,497 --> 00:09:23,932
Steve, calm down.

176
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,368
You calm down!

177
00:09:25,403 --> 00:09:26,413
Oh, yeah?

178
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:32,162
I thought that we could
head over to my tennis club.

179
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,223
I'll show you what's
going on with my serve.

180
00:09:34,258 --> 00:09:36,766
Can you hop a tall fence?
I'm a little behind on my dues.

181
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:40,911
Sure, a black guy breaking in to a country club.
Mm, nothing bad could happen there!

182
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:42,623
Yeah, fine. Okay,

183
00:09:42,658 --> 00:09:45,030
I'll go practice, I'll tell you how it went.
Just gimme your cell phone number.

184
00:09:45,065 --> 00:09:49,510
All right, that's it. Look, Mr. Corman,
I will see you whenever I have office hours,

185
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:51,913
but I will not see you
outside of this hospital.

186
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:54,810
And there is no way that I would ever
give you my cell phone number!

187
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,865
No matter how awesome
or perfect it may be!

188
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,451
Are we clear on that?

189
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:00,496
Yes, doctor.

190
00:10:01,882 --> 00:10:05,237
Maybe it's just me, but...

191
00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:07,632
I wouldn't put up with that.

192
00:10:09,638 --> 00:10:11,269
I'm listening.

193
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:17,599
I gotta tell you, sitting here watching you play with
your food makes you seem much less horrifying.

194
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,403
Oh, I know how I come off.

195
00:10:20,438 --> 00:10:23,162
You know, but I have to
put that act on for my job.

196
00:10:23,197 --> 00:10:27,566
It's kind of like how you act all nerdy and
spastic to seem more accessible to your patients.

197
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:30,054
I'm glad you got that.

198
00:10:30,314 --> 00:10:31,310
You're sweet.

199
00:10:31,345 --> 00:10:33,090
Oh my God, is she
flirting with me?

200
00:10:33,402 --> 00:10:34,956
Oh my God, am I
flirting with you?

201
00:10:34,991 --> 00:10:36,469
Oh my God,
is she psychic?

202
00:10:36,504 --> 00:10:39,187
You must think I'm such a mess!
I don't even know how to flirt.

203
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,362
Ohh, come on,
it's easy.

204
00:10:41,397 --> 00:10:44,898
I'll tell you what, take some of that cupcake
frosting and just lick it off your finger.

205
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:48,241
You mean...
like this?

206
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:51,254
I think that was
mashed potatoes.

207
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:53,151
Wait, is she in to me?

208
00:10:53,356 --> 00:10:55,385
Quick, make a bad joke
and see if she laughs.

209
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,945
Did you hear the one about the
skeleton who couldn't go to the party?

210
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,213
He had no "body" to go with.

211
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:03,239
That's really funny!

212
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:06,134
Well that's not a fair test,
that joke's hilarious.

213
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:08,411
Still, right then I
decided something.

214
00:11:09,282 --> 00:11:11,280
Listen, I know you hate everything
about Miss Broderick,

215
00:11:11,315 --> 00:11:15,099
but her father is in need of medical care,
and it is our medical obligation to treat him,

216
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:18,319
whether his daughter is a murderer,
a drug addict, or a terrorist.

217
00:11:18,354 --> 00:11:19,629
I know, but a lawyer?

218
00:11:19,664 --> 00:11:20,925
Even a lawyer.

219
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,221
It's what we do.

220
00:11:22,256 --> 00:11:24,311
Who taught you this crap?

221
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,965
It's nice to have the right
answer to a tough question.

222
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,908
You did.

223
00:11:27,943 --> 00:11:28,728
Oh.

224
00:11:30,077 --> 00:11:32,022
It's definitely better than
having no answer at all.

225
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:35,601
Elliot, do you think I should
even be a doctor?

226
00:11:43,566 --> 00:11:44,721
Not at dinner!

227
00:11:44,756 --> 00:11:47,546
Baby, if you call Turk,
you get Turk!

228
00:11:48,176 --> 00:11:49,101
You got Turk.

229
00:11:49,136 --> 00:11:51,881
If you do answer, you better
be prepared for the worst.

230
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,637
Hi! You have a sec?

231
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,375
Who gave you this number?

232
00:11:58,073 --> 00:11:59,631
He did.

233
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:04,447
I'm not gonna lie to
you there, Newbie,

234
00:12:04,482 --> 00:12:07,466
you really impressed me by parroting
my ethical speech back to me.

235
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:08,897
What the hell got into you?

236
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:11,684
As for me, I didn't have to
say anything and he knew.

237
00:12:16,442 --> 00:12:20,384
Ohh, Priscilla, you are so busted!

238
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:22,764
Dammit, he sees like a hawk!

239
00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:29,101
So now, what, she just bats her
eyes and you change your tune?

240
00:12:29,136 --> 00:12:31,908
Who in the hell am I kidding?
Of course you fell for her act,

241
00:12:31,943 --> 00:12:33,837
you're the loneliest
guy in this hospital!

242
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,440
Oh, no, he's not the loneliest guy.

243
00:12:36,475 --> 00:12:38,300
That's the loneliest guy.
Watch this.

244
00:12:39,397 --> 00:12:40,584
Excuse me?

245
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,230
Neena played you like proud owner
of the world's longest dry streak.

246
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,139
You know what, can I ask
you a personal question?

247
00:12:48,174 --> 00:12:52,420
Exactly how long has it been since you've
swept the stuffed animals off of your bed,

248
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:55,419
thrown your ankles up in the air,
and thanked whatever god you pray to

249
00:12:55,454 --> 00:12:57,082
that you didn't have on
your granny panties?

250
00:12:57,117 --> 00:13:00,217
For your information, there's
a certain foxy nurse that

251
00:13:00,252 --> 00:13:03,127
requested my services at her
apartment just last weekend.

252
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,286
Hold on.
I'm almost there!

253
00:13:07,665 --> 00:13:10,018
Okay! Your new bed's all in.

254
00:13:10,446 --> 00:13:11,849
What now?

255
00:13:11,884 --> 00:13:13,253
You leave.

256
00:13:16,102 --> 00:13:18,460
Still don't understand
why he couldn't do it.

257
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:23,347
All right, even if I am a little desperate,
Neena was not playing me.

258
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:24,489
I was playing you.

259
00:13:24,524 --> 00:13:26,482
You're just saying that
because he's here.

260
00:13:26,517 --> 00:13:28,169
No, I manipulated you.

261
00:13:28,311 --> 00:13:30,223
You're just saying that
because he's here.

262
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:34,482
Ookay, we seem to be in a bit of a loop here,
so I'm just gonna step over and talk to this one.

263
00:13:34,517 --> 00:13:36,436
Are you gonna do the
procedure on my father or not?

264
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:39,720
I'm gonna go ahead and leave this
decision up to the lonely guy.

265
00:13:50,156 --> 00:13:51,170
What are you
doing here?

266
00:13:51,883 --> 00:13:53,319
Ah. Hiding from Doug.

267
00:13:53,547 --> 00:13:55,013
He asked me a question
I haven't answered yet.

268
00:13:55,197 --> 00:13:56,057
You?

269
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:59,383
I was trying to make a dramatic exit.
I thought this was a patient's room.

270
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:00,583
Right.

271
00:14:01,778 --> 00:14:03,291
What are they
doing here?

272
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:07,697
This is a hospital! He should
really have his shirt on.

273
00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:08,199
Yeah.

274
00:14:08,522 --> 00:14:10,193
Dynamite areolas,
though, huh?

275
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:14,638
Hey, Night School!

276
00:14:15,665 --> 00:14:17,436
Mr. Corman followed
us home last night!

277
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:19,172
How'd you get my
cell phone number?

278
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:23,594
Ehh, once you got somebody's drivers license
and a urine sample, you get just about anything.

279
00:14:23,815 --> 00:14:25,917
How do you flunk
eighth grade gym?

280
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:28,680
You better stop messing
with my husband.

281
00:14:28,715 --> 00:14:31,409
You-tell him to stop
messing with my walls!

282
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:36,660
You did this?

283
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:38,956
Baby, you know
you're my world.

284
00:14:41,425 --> 00:14:42,806
I'm out.

285
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:46,183
I flunked gym, too.

286
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:49,102
Didn't like the shorts.

287
00:14:49,528 --> 00:14:52,240
By the way, your number isn't
"CALL-TURK", it's "CALL-TUR".

288
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:55,916
It'd be easier if your
name was "Cal Turk. "

289
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:58,191
There's nobody
named Cal Turk!

290
00:14:58,603 --> 00:14:59,854
Cal Turk here!

291
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:03,602
We don't sell insurance,
we sell peace of mind!

292
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,645
But only to white people.

293
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:09,679
Would you like
some milk?

294
00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:12,097
Carla, have you
seen Miss Broderick?

295
00:15:12,132 --> 00:15:13,700
Maybe you should ask Ted.

296
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:19,754
- So she's nearby...
- Mm-hmm.

297
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:22,108
Your father's gonna be just fine.

298
00:15:22,143 --> 00:15:25,127
The place is top-notch!
I practically live here!

299
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:26,194
Are you a doctor?

300
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:30,929
Massive hypochondriac. If you'll excuse
me, I have to go harass a surgeon.

301
00:15:38,076 --> 00:15:40,712
If you've come to tell me your decision
about my father, just say it and leave.

302
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:44,257
Look, your little ice show doesn't work on me,
okay, I've seen the real you. You can't even flirt.

303
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:45,574
Oh, really?

304
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:50,391
- Why are you doing this?
- I love my dad. I'd do anything.

305
00:15:50,426 --> 00:15:52,751
But if it makes you feel any better,
I think you're really sweet.

306
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:54,010
How'm I supposed to believe that?

307
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:56,391
Well, you can't. I already lied to
you once so the trust is broken,

308
00:15:56,426 --> 00:15:57,618
even though I'd
never lie to you again.

309
00:15:57,653 --> 00:15:58,439
Really?

310
00:15:58,474 --> 00:15:59,226
Who knows.

311
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:02,587
Look, do whatever you think is right,
regardless of how I feel about you.

312
00:16:02,622 --> 00:16:04,670
And if it helps you out, I'm not
the least bit interested.

313
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:08,004
Like that matters.
I'm not that lonely.

314
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:15,626
When you're faced with a big decision, sometimes
you need to be alone with your thoughts.

315
00:16:15,996 --> 00:16:18,068
'Course, in a hospital,
that's a problem.

316
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:21,483
You see, around here places to be
alone are hard to come by.

317
00:16:24,544 --> 00:16:27,066
How do I decide if we should
do the procedure or not?

318
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:30,638
How do I tell someone he
shouldn't be a doctor?

319
00:16:30,815 --> 00:16:33,256
How do I get my patient
to stop stalking me?

320
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:36,609
How do I get these people to realize
that just because I'm in a coma

321
00:16:36,644 --> 00:16:38,125
doesn't mean I can't hear them?

322
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,410
I'm hungry.

323
00:16:40,594 --> 00:16:42,609
Turk, the way I see it,
you got two options:

324
00:16:42,644 --> 00:16:45,579
You can go hard-core with Mr. Corman,
slap a restraining order on him

325
00:16:45,614 --> 00:16:47,018
and switch him to
another doctor...

326
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,068
Guy's a pain in the ass, but
I can't do that to him!

327
00:16:50,283 --> 00:16:53,406
Then you just have to re-establish your
boundarie and wean him off the home visits.

328
00:16:53,441 --> 00:16:54,088
It's easy.

329
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:56,396
'Course, you'll definitely have to
change your cell phone number.

330
00:16:57,826 --> 00:16:59,823
Mr. Corman, I filed
a restraining order.

331
00:16:59,858 --> 00:17:03,297
Which means if you come to
my house, call my cell phone-

332
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:06,414
Excuse me, I know what
a restraining order is.

333
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:08,377
You act like I've never dated.

334
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:10,985
Bye, Mr. Corman.

335
00:17:14,883 --> 00:17:19,147
Turk's incredible selfishness in sacrificing
a patient to keep his cell phone number

336
00:17:19,182 --> 00:17:21,210
motivated Elliot and I to
do the right thing.

337
00:17:21,245 --> 00:17:22,709
Do the procedure.

338
00:17:23,047 --> 00:17:24,332
Okay.

339
00:17:25,807 --> 00:17:27,815
Even if the right thing
is really hard.

340
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:33,046
Doug, I'm sorry, but...

341
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:35,684
I don't think you're cut
out for being a doctor.

342
00:17:41,284 --> 00:17:43,709
I cannot figure out
how this guy died.

343
00:17:45,661 --> 00:17:48,840
I'm betting he took a paracentesis
needle to the aorta.

344
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,433
Have you seen this before?

345
00:17:50,468 --> 00:17:51,373
Seen it?

346
00:17:51,408 --> 00:17:53,645
Upstairs they call
that a "Doug"!

347
00:17:55,173 --> 00:17:57,290
You got any others
you can't figure out?

348
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,440
Doctor prescribed
overdosage of Fentanyl.

349
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,084
Dissected left main during
a cardiac catheterization.

350
00:18:05,323 --> 00:18:08,567
We look under
Mr. Pancreas and...

351
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,049
there it is.

352
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:14,022
He's the best I've ever seen.
Mind if we steal him from you?

353
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:14,943
I can live with it.

354
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,457
Well, my work here is done.

355
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:21,398
I'll get those.

356
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:27,736
So my dad's gonna be okay?

357
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:29,019
He's great.

358
00:18:29,313 --> 00:18:30,203
Thank you.

359
00:18:30,378 --> 00:18:32,849
And I hope I didn't ruffle your
feathers too much while I was here.

360
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:38,462
Sweetheart, I find it amusing that you think
you're so much as a blip on my radar.

361
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:41,110
Better go ahead and jot this down
in your little lawyer notebook:

362
00:18:41,145 --> 00:18:46,415
Nothing you could possibly do
could ever, hee-hever get to me.

363
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:48,928
I should probably thank him, too.

364
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,488
Oh, my God.

365
00:18:55,975 --> 00:18:59,339
I'm gagging and vomiting
at the same time! I'm...

366
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:02,008
I'm gavomiting!

367
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:07,361
You know, if you really wanna piss him off,
we should follow him to his office

368
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,145
and just have sex
righ in front of him!

369
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,791
Ahhhh, that would never work,
I couldn't perform. It's a mental thing.

370
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:14,784
Okay, thank you.

371
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:17,292
Okay, I'm confused, I thought
you weren't interested in me.

372
00:19:17,622 --> 00:19:20,053
Well maybe I just said that
to make it easier for you.

373
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:25,645
Or maybe I said it 'cause I knew you'd do
what I wanted you to. I'm not sure.

374
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:30,382
As I stood there confused but
enjoying Neena's very long kiss

375
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:32,384
with just the right
amount of tongue,

376
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:36,214
I thought about how when you make
tough decisions good things can happen.

377
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,689
Like the confidence you can gain
from finding your true calling.

378
00:19:40,724 --> 00:19:43,879
Hey, Nelson. Got some of your handiwork
down in the morgue today.

379
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:46,695
Were you operating with
a blindfold on or what?

380
00:19:50,631 --> 00:19:52,463
And when you make decisions
for the wrong reasons,

381
00:19:52,498 --> 00:19:54,405
they can come back
to bite you in the ass.

382
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:56,132
Ten feet, Mr. Corman!

383
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:57,378
No problem.

384
00:19:57,558 --> 00:19:59,285
I'm suing you.

385
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:06,821
Dude! Mr. Corman is suing me! And
that ice princess is his attorney!

386
00:20:07,058 --> 00:20:09,107
When did he get a
chance to meet her?

387
00:20:15,927 --> 00:20:17,496
What am I gonna do?

388
00:20:17,531 --> 00:20:20,020
Call Turk as soon as you get this!

389
00:20:20,985 --> 00:20:22,743
Are you coming in or what?

390
00:20:23,062 --> 00:20:26,836
In the end, it's always best to rely on
your principles to make decisions.

391
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,551
Hell yeah!

392
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:37,362
Message deleted.
