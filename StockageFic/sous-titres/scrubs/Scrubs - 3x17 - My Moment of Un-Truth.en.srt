1
00:00:01,583 --> 00:00:03,154
Buddy, I get that you
and Carla have been

2
00:00:03,195 --> 00:00:04,709
hanging out a lot, but pretending you're

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,195
going to steal her from
me makes you seem sad,

4
00:00:07,196 --> 00:00:08,665
pathetic and very lonely.

5
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,408
Your woman wants me so bad,

6
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:13,495
we've developed our own little
shorthand with each other.

7
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:15,688
- Mornin'.
- Morning.

8
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:16,895
That means good morning.

9
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,907
Noted.

10
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:19,439
How was mardi gras night?

11
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,394
Ooh!

12
00:00:21,395 --> 00:00:23,584
Come on!

13
00:00:23,585 --> 00:00:25,982
Enough beads. No more flashing.

14
00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:28,413
More beads, damn it! Come on!

15
00:00:28,414 --> 00:00:29,598
Fine.

16
00:00:34,853 --> 00:00:35,917
Bite me.

17
00:00:35,918 --> 00:00:37,555
Sounds pretty embarrassing.

18
00:00:37,556 --> 00:00:39,552
Only because Jasper becomes an innie

19
00:00:39,553 --> 00:00:41,153
when he gets nervous.

20
00:00:42,798 --> 00:00:44,096
Still...

21
00:00:44,097 --> 00:00:46,211
Friends forever!

22
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,821
Of course, not all relationships

23
00:00:48,822 --> 00:00:50,306
are as solid as Carla's and mine.

24
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:53,647
Dr. Reid, why are you using

25
00:00:53,648 --> 00:00:55,472
standard macrolides
to treat your patient

26
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:56,979
instead of clo-veritol?

27
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,989
Oh, clo-veritol is a
drug? Now, honestly, Bob,

28
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,926
here I was under the
impression that it was

29
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:06,169
a travel agency, what with
all the free golf trips

30
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,944
they've gone ahead and sent you on.

31
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:09,867
I'll have you know that
I do not authorize any

32
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:12,486
drug for this hospital that I
haven't personally researched.

33
00:01:13,604 --> 00:01:15,901
What did the research
for clo-veritol say, sir?

34
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:21,183
When life's not fair
at all, use clo-veritol.

35
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:27,193
Check out Barbie,
body-slamming big Bob.

36
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:28,440
That a girl!

37
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:31,384
Look, I have spent the last
3 years in this hospital

38
00:01:31,385 --> 00:01:33,600
getting pushed around
because I'm "little Barbie

39
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:34,826
from connecticut."

40
00:01:34,827 --> 00:01:37,034
But there is a new toy
in town, and her name

41
00:01:37,035 --> 00:01:38,538
is "bitch slap Barbie."

42
00:01:40,512 --> 00:01:41,848
From connecticut.

43
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:44,809
Still, let's remember
that you can't even

44
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,057
drive the doctor car without big daddy

45
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:48,808
sitting right there beside you,

46
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,966
because you went ahead and accidentally

47
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:54,938
gave the patient over in
bed 4 macrolides and opiates,

48
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,537
2 medications that i
guarantee you are going

49
00:01:57,538 --> 00:01:59,008
to make her nauseous.

50
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,385
My patient is fine, and I don't need you

51
00:02:04,498 --> 00:02:06,938
I roughly think that
would be the faint sound

52
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:08,403
of your patient vomiting.

53
00:02:08,404 --> 00:02:09,823
You may be having trouble hearing it

54
00:02:09,824 --> 00:02:12,486
over the much louder sound
of me being right yet again.

55
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:18,300
Oh, god?

56
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:20,280
My brilliance is now becoming a bit

57
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:21,684
of a burden.

58
00:02:22,674 --> 00:02:23,575
Get back to me.

59
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:26,365
I got to give mr. Ingram his meds,

60
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:27,492
so...later.

61
00:02:27,493 --> 00:02:28,509
Later.

62
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,909
That means "I'll be seeing you later."

63
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:32,747
You want my fiancée,

64
00:02:32,748 --> 00:02:34,609
just go ahead and take
her, 'cause she's been

65
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,798
naggin' the crap out of me.

66
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:37,316
"Pick up your socks, wash your dishes,

67
00:02:37,317 --> 00:02:38,954
stop whispering booyah to J.D.

68
00:02:38,955 --> 00:02:40,870
in the morning after we have sex."

69
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:42,425
How else am i supposed to know?

70
00:02:42,426 --> 00:02:44,128
I'm sayin'! But you know what?

71
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:45,575
I'm not givin' her anymore ammo.

72
00:02:45,576 --> 00:02:47,148
There is no way in hell
that she will ever be

73
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:48,391
able to bust my...

74
00:02:48,392 --> 00:02:49,420
damn!

75
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:52,390
Ooh! That ass warrants the
batman sound effect salute.

76
00:02:56,807 --> 00:02:58,228
Turk, how come every time I turn around

77
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:00,157
you're checking out some
woman's you-know-what?

78
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:01,574
Tushie parts?

79
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:02,858
Thanks for having my back.

80
00:03:03,915 --> 00:03:04,697
Babe.

81
00:03:06,241 --> 00:03:08,285
That means now she all mad.

82
00:03:23,723 --> 00:03:24,819
When you work in a hospital

83
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,442
You can count on an
ever-changing roster

84
00:03:26,443 --> 00:03:28,619
of new faces, whether
it's the new flower lady

85
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:32,183
who winks too much
or the plastic surgeon

86
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:33,852
who's returned after spending 3 years

87
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:35,864
fixing cleft palates in
third world countries.

88
00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:38,758
So if any of you are interested in

89
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,830
following in the philanthropic footsteps

90
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:42,794
of Dr. Ramirez, he has graciously

91
00:03:42,795 --> 00:03:44,869
offered to answer any of your questions.

92
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:49,675
I told you no one would care.

93
00:03:51,043 --> 00:03:52,663
Sometimes a new face will
just outright surprise you.

94
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,292
What the hell are you doing?

95
00:03:57,293 --> 00:04:00,304
Me? Nothin', man. I'm just waitin'

96
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:01,658
for my brother to get off work.

97
00:04:03,038 --> 00:04:03,947
Maybe you know him.

98
00:04:03,948 --> 00:04:07,049
He's a janitor here. My name's Rocksco.

99
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:12,257
- Why is he doing that?
- I think he gets bored.

100
00:04:16,147 --> 00:04:17,683
So I'm supposed to
marry someone who's going

101
00:04:17,684 --> 00:04:19,147
to stare at women for
the rest of my life?

102
00:04:19,148 --> 00:04:20,921
Well, I wouldn't put it
that way in your vows.

103
00:04:20,922 --> 00:04:22,908
Let's see how he likes it
when I do it in front of him.

104
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:24,097
Hey, honey!

105
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,160
What's up, baby?

106
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:28,170
It's good, isn't it?

107
00:04:28,171 --> 00:04:29,422
That's because every time

108
00:04:29,423 --> 00:04:30,903
Estelle's working,
she puts extra croutons

109
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:32,080
into the stuffing.

110
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:33,573
And yet the salads always suffer.

111
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:36,398
Excuse me. I am talking about that man's ass!

112
00:04:38,142 --> 00:04:38,829
Gotta go !

113
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,215
You know, 'cause it's
such a fine, chiseled

114
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:42,246
dig-your-fingernails
into it kind of ass.

115
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:43,818
Babe, he probably works out.

116
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,843
-Carla?
-Ron!

117
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:52,167
Kudos on the nice pooper.

118
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:55,781
Thank you. Mine's firm, like mutton.

119
00:04:55,782 --> 00:04:57,161
Lovely.

120
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:02,134
Ok, mr. Thompson, we've
got your fever down,

121
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,041
but how's the pain in your abdomen?

122
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:05,198
Practically gone.

123
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:06,656
Really?

124
00:05:09,748 --> 00:05:11,198
Little trick I picked up in med school.

125
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:14,064
Good trick. I think my insides exploded.

126
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:16,602
Now I suspect you've got pancreatitis,

127
00:05:16,603 --> 00:05:17,964
so we're going to run

128
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:19,532
some lfts and do an ultrasound.

129
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:21,476
But in the meantime, I
am going to prescribe you

130
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:22,751
something for your pain.

131
00:05:22,752 --> 00:05:24,120
No, no, no, please,
please, don't sweat it.

132
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:25,208
I'm used to the pain.

133
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:27,564
Besides my mom is
bringing by the kids later

134
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:29,524
and I figure there should
be at least one sober adult

135
00:05:29,525 --> 00:05:30,562
in the room.

136
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:36,201
No, seriously, she's a drunk.

137
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,060
Oh, sorry.

138
00:05:42,913 --> 00:05:43,750
Stop it.

139
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,371
There's nothing worse
than being around 2 people

140
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:48,316
with a history.

141
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:49,907
So did Shari and Steve ever get married?

142
00:05:49,908 --> 00:05:51,317
You didn't hear what happened?

143
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:52,538
Please say you heard.

144
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:53,720
- No, I didn't.
- Damn you, ron!

145
00:05:54,446 --> 00:05:55,661
Steve took a year off to take care of

146
00:05:55,662 --> 00:05:56,755
his parents, and while he was gone,

147
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,265
Shari started seeing Dr. Harding.

148
00:05:58,266 --> 00:05:59,563
Nooo! Really?

149
00:05:59,564 --> 00:06:00,302
Yes.

150
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,191
Shari and gary?

151
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,738
But that summer, they
took a river-rafting trip

152
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,461
through the grand canyon
and they both drowned.

153
00:06:06,462 --> 00:06:08,195
Oh, thank God!

154
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:15,151
You know, 'cause they... they both died

155
00:06:15,152 --> 00:06:16,474
doing what they loved.

156
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,866
Rafting.

157
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:25,985
So everybody treating you ok?

158
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,798
Yeah! You know, the nurse that does

159
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:29,250
the sponge baths, wouldn't be shocked

160
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:30,430
if she's killed before.

161
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,798
Hey, sunshine!

162
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:34,291
Why don't you just calm your ass down?

163
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:36,343
You was barely bleeding.

164
00:06:36,344 --> 00:06:37,987
From a bath, woman!

165
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,393
I don't get it. I've
run every single test.

166
00:06:41,394 --> 00:06:42,805
I cannot figure out why this guy is

167
00:06:42,806 --> 00:06:43,861
in so much pain.

168
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,693
Did you run
a d-u-h test?

169
00:06:45,694 --> 00:06:47,827
What's a D.U.H.?
- Uh, duh!!

170
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,877
The guy is a drug addict trying to score

171
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,103
painkillers.

172
00:06:52,104 --> 00:06:54,374
But he refused drugs.

173
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:58,740
My bad. He is a very clever drug addict.

174
00:06:58,741 --> 00:07:02,018
Look, I hate to question
your 3 years of wisdom,

175
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:04,068
but your pain guy is just like a million

176
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:06,079
other drug addicts
who walk into hospitals

177
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,505
every year with their
aches and their pains

178
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:10,984
and their spasms and their
cramps and their myalgia

179
00:07:10,985 --> 00:07:12,461
and their neuralgia, and their otalgia

180
00:07:12,462 --> 00:07:14,578
or any other algia they
can possibly think of

181
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:16,011
just so they can get a fix.

182
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:17,963
Well, I believe in this guy.

183
00:07:19,218 --> 00:07:20,386
Would you like to go out on a limb,

184
00:07:20,387 --> 00:07:21,875
sign him in, keep him overnight?

185
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:24,308
You know, Dr. Cox, you think

186
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:26,195
that you have seen it all

187
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,700
and done it all, but guess what?

188
00:07:27,701 --> 00:07:29,394
You haven't done me!

189
00:07:32,148 --> 00:07:33,040
Give her a second there, gang.

190
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,126
That didn't come out right.

191
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:38,089
Go!

192
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,203
Yo, if you're captain out there today,

193
00:07:42,204 --> 00:07:43,618
pick me first, and then I'll be like,

194
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:44,953
"dude, we always play together."

195
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:46,472
Then you can pick who you really
want to pick, but everyone else

196
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:48,900
will think you wanted to pick me first.
-When do you think of this stuff?

197
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,224
Every minute of every day.

198
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:52,802
Hey, either of you guys
seen my twin brother?

199
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:57,337
Hey! I asked you a question.

200
00:07:57,338 --> 00:07:58,604
You're better than this.

201
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:10,438
Whoo whoo!

202
00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:44,067
Any sign of my brother, the janitor?

203
00:08:44,994 --> 00:08:47,638
Dude, there is no way that we ever,

204
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,019
ever believe this one.

205
00:08:51,979 --> 00:08:53,334
Can someone say keep rockin'?

206
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:05,486
Hey, Carla, after you check
Mrs. Ruck's I.V. In room 310,

207
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:07,319
can you zip down to the cafeteria

208
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,058
and flirt more with Dr. Hotbutt?

209
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:11,925
Fine. So I was flirting
with him a little.

210
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,673
But I used to have
such a crush on the guy.

211
00:09:14,674 --> 00:09:16,499
And besides, you flirt sometimes.

212
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,966
It's harmless, right?

213
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:23,868
Can I press your button?

214
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:26,549
I don't know. Can I press yours?

215
00:09:34,678 --> 00:09:35,703
It's not always harmless.

216
00:09:36,824 --> 00:09:38,210
Hey, Carla,

217
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,392
I was wondering if you wanted

218
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:41,896
to grab dinner with me tonight.

219
00:09:43,446 --> 00:09:45,135
It's always a risk when
you go out on a limb.

220
00:09:45,136 --> 00:09:47,095
Ultimately you just
make yourself vulnerable.

221
00:09:47,096 --> 00:09:49,101
Laverne, did you pull up
Mr. Thompson's old charts?

222
00:09:49,102 --> 00:09:51,920
He was here, like, 8 years
ago, complaining of the same

223
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:55,435
abdominal pain, but as soon as
he was given his pain medication,

224
00:09:55,436 --> 00:09:57,185
he went A.M.A.

225
00:09:57,186 --> 00:09:59,785
He just took the drugs and bolted?

226
00:09:59,786 --> 00:10:02,389
No, he took some towels, too.

227
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,910
Frick!

228
00:10:06,795 --> 00:10:07,627
So what do you say?

229
00:10:07,628 --> 00:10:11,375
And you just hate to see anyone
get crushed, even Dr. Hotbutt.

230
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:13,219
Sure. That sounds great.

231
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,527
I'm sorry, what?

232
00:10:20,531 --> 00:10:21,530
What the hell just happened?

233
00:10:21,531 --> 00:10:23,544
I don't know. He asked me out to dinner

234
00:10:23,545 --> 00:10:25,451
and I said yes. It just came out.

235
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,823
Shame!

236
00:10:27,824 --> 00:10:30,176
Look, everyone thinks it's just
guys who get all freaked out

237
00:10:30,177 --> 00:10:32,205
before the wedding, but
it happens to women, too.

238
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:34,165
And Ronnie... -Ronnie?

239
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,083
Ron. Ron.

240
00:10:36,084 --> 00:10:37,223
He's not just some guy, J.D.

241
00:10:37,224 --> 00:10:38,374
He's my "what if" guy,

242
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,957
the one I always wondered about,

243
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,297
the one I idealized, you know?

244
00:10:41,298 --> 00:10:43,752
If I go out with him and I feel nothing,

245
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:45,424
you know how confident
I'll feel about turk?

246
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:47,773
Now I want you to go.

247
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:49,100
You know what that means?

248
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:50,638
That she's a sorceress.

249
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,926
Look, I would never do
anything inappropriate.

250
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,235
Then you won't mind if I tell Turk.

251
00:10:56,236 --> 00:10:59,778
If you have to, go ahead.
But then I'll know that

252
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:02,363
we're not as close as I thought.

253
00:11:06,325 --> 00:11:07,887
Damn beads.

254
00:11:09,995 --> 00:11:12,171
Mr. Thompson, I was just taking
a look at your old charts.

255
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,322
Yes! He was just telling me
that the last time he was here,

256
00:11:15,323 --> 00:11:17,650
his doctor couldn't diagnose
him and just threw a bunch of

257
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:19,187
painkillers at him instead.
- He did?

258
00:11:20,935 --> 00:11:22,094
I was so frustrated, I took off,

259
00:11:22,095 --> 00:11:24,575
but I have to say with Dr. Reid here,

260
00:11:24,576 --> 00:11:26,583
I know we're finally gonna
get to the bottom of things.

261
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:27,795
She is one terrific doctor.

262
00:11:27,796 --> 00:11:30,267
So this pain you're having
is making you delusional.

263
00:11:30,268 --> 00:11:34,122
- No. Why?
- No reason.

264
00:11:38,112 --> 00:11:40,204
Well, this is nice,
after all these years

265
00:11:40,205 --> 00:11:41,794
actually being out with you.

266
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:43,304
Yeah, so where do you want to sit?

267
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:44,860
How about here ?

268
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:54,951
We have a lovely selection of condoms.

269
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:59,065
Ooh! Lemon zinger!

270
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:03,260
Uncool.

271
00:12:03,261 --> 00:12:04,912
What were you thinkin' about?

272
00:12:06,948 --> 00:12:08,591
What you'd look like
if you were chinese.

273
00:12:08,592 --> 00:12:10,157
Me, too!

274
00:12:10,158 --> 00:12:11,598
Ooh, that was lucky.

275
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:14,105
Hey, fellas! Guess what's on.

276
00:12:14,106 --> 00:12:18,352
A little show that I like to
call indisputable evidence.

277
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:23,738
Thank you, brothers, for inviting me

278
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:26,630
to your twin birthday party!

279
00:12:26,631 --> 00:12:28,129
No problem, Troy.

280
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,396
Hey, brother, why don't you enjoy

281
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:32,939
this nice pen set that I got for you?

282
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,480
Check it out.

283
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:40,590
Take your time. Approach it slowly.

284
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:44,391
Hey, wow! Thanks, bro!

285
00:12:44,392 --> 00:12:46,797
I'm definitely gonna
use this to write to you

286
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:49,412
when I finish my
around-the-world travels.

287
00:12:49,413 --> 00:12:52,424
Put her there, man. All right!

288
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:54,370
You do a good job around here.

289
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,532
And that, boys, is a
brotherly handshake.

290
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:01,246
Sometimes around here,

291
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,403
you can't believe what you're seeing.

292
00:13:10,714 --> 00:13:12,140
Other times, it's as clear as day.

293
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:16,430
Thanks.

294
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:21,159
Oh Great! You're getting
medication for your "pain patient."

295
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,582
But, say, why stop there?

296
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,035
How's about we load up our
fanny packs with happy pills,

297
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:28,210
drive downtown, I'll hang out
of the sun-roof, and we can just

298
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:32,050
throw fistfuls of 'em right at drug addicts
and it'll just be a big happy parade!

299
00:13:35,284 --> 00:13:37,862
You know what's amazing about you?
You have this unbelievable ability

300
00:13:37,863 --> 00:13:39,029
to make me doubt myself.

301
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,557
I don't think I could possibly
make you doubt yourself

302
00:13:41,558 --> 00:13:44,547
ya rascal, unless you
had the unnatural talent

303
00:13:44,548 --> 00:13:46,498
for being wrong most of the time.

304
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:50,004
Well, I'm not wrong. I just saw
Mr. Thompson writhing in pain

305
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:52,218
and he had no idea
that I was watching him.

306
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:53,806
But you probably don't care about that,

307
00:13:53,807 --> 00:13:57,300
because you're more concerned with being
right than doing what's right. Aren't you?

308
00:14:00,781 --> 00:14:03,052
Stay calm. Turk's never
gonna find out about her date.

309
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:05,431
You got a minute to talk?

310
00:14:05,432 --> 00:14:07,521
I got lots of time to talk. Do you
wanna talk about anything? Anything?

311
00:14:07,522 --> 00:14:09,820
Hours to talk. We could talk
about our feelings. Wh-what's up?

312
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:12,966
Look, I been thinking about this
whole Carla nagging me thing, right?

313
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:15,504
And I know it's coming from
a good place because, well,

314
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:17,658
let's face it, the woman
lives and dies for me.

315
00:14:27,543 --> 00:14:28,151
More wine?

316
00:14:28,152 --> 00:14:29,635
Oh, God! Yes!

317
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:32,420
So I'm supposed to marry
someone who's gonna bust my chops

318
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:34,675
every time I look at a woman
for the rest of my life?

319
00:14:34,676 --> 00:14:37,691
Well, I wouldn't put it that
way in your vows... Hand me that?

320
00:14:37,692 --> 00:14:38,911
Here you go.

321
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,825
So you and that girl Kelly
finally broke up, huh?

322
00:14:43,826 --> 00:14:46,888
Yeah.... What was that cute
name that you used to call her?

323
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:51,782
Skunk-face! I was
a little mean back then.

324
00:14:51,783 --> 00:14:54,844
Nahhh. I always used to think you
were...the sweetest girl on earth.

325
00:14:56,821 --> 00:15:02,165
Nag! Nag! Nag! Nag! You see how Carla is lately.
I mean, is that all I have to look forward to?

326
00:15:03,638 --> 00:15:05,031
I hear they're coming out
with a stuart little 3.

327
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:07,682
No, it's on hold. The
director dropped out.

328
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:09,465
Turk, don't you have any work to do?

329
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:11,843
Dude, surgeon.

330
00:15:13,219 --> 00:15:14,941
Beads, keep me strong!

331
00:15:14,942 --> 00:15:15,909
What?

332
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:16,499
Nothing.

333
00:15:19,246 --> 00:15:20,479
I'm so glad we did this!

334
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,469
Oh, me too. You know, I have to
leave for a lecture tour on Monday,

335
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,544
but I'm back the last week in April,
so maybe we can get together then.

336
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:28,842
You know,

337
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:29,841
I'm getting married april 24.

338
00:15:29,842 --> 00:15:30,963
So then our plans totally
interfere with your honeymoon.

339
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:32,027
A little bit.

340
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:33,540
Excited about it ?

341
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,631
I'm so excited.

342
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:40,723
Mr. Thompson, I've decided
I'd like to prescribe you

343
00:15:40,724 --> 00:15:41,847
something for the pain.

344
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:42,961
Well, you know,

345
00:15:42,962 --> 00:15:44,228
that's your call.

346
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:46,257
There's just one little problem.

347
00:15:46,258 --> 00:15:49,642
Oh, my god! Just give
me the drugs, 'k, lady?

348
00:15:49,643 --> 00:15:51,068
For God's sake, I've been working you

349
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:53,251
from every possible angle.
I refused painkillers.

350
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,960
I did the "you're the greatest
doctor" bit, which I know you loved.

351
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:59,430
then somewhere between, getting a
tube in my ass and a tube in my mouth

352
00:15:59,431 --> 00:16:01,583
which by the way, I'm still
praying wasn't the same tube,

353
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:04,324
I found time to do the whole "I'm
writhing in pain but I don't know

354
00:16:04,325 --> 00:16:05,631
if you're watching me" thing!

355
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,179
So please, or pretty please, or
however you want me to say it, Doctor,

356
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,380
why don't you say it! Why don't
you say it! Why don't you tell me

357
00:16:10,381 --> 00:16:12,986
what the problem is, AND SAY IT!

358
00:16:15,661 --> 00:16:17,371
I was just gonna say
that my pen doesn't work,

359
00:16:17,372 --> 00:16:20,139
and I needed a new one
to write out your dosage.

360
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,966
Oh. Awesome.

361
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,512
I felt nothing for him.

362
00:16:34,513 --> 00:16:35,693
How cool is that?

363
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,327
Had a dream just like this,

364
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:39,655
except I had a saddle on my
back and you were an indian.

365
00:16:39,656 --> 00:16:41,900
Turk was a donkey.

366
00:16:43,674 --> 00:16:44,506
I'm gonna go tell Turk.

367
00:16:44,507 --> 00:16:46,798
Oh, that's great. She's gonna go

368
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,366
...wait. What?!

369
00:16:54,768 --> 00:16:56,955
Whatever you do, don't scream.

370
00:16:58,647 --> 00:16:59,548
Why would I scream ?

371
00:16:59,549 --> 00:17:00,667
I don't know.

372
00:17:00,668 --> 00:17:02,167
People always say that in the movies.

373
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:05,419
Anyway, I don't think Turk's gonna be as
excited about your big date as you are.

374
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,096
All right? He definitely won't
love the fact that I knew about it.

375
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:10,960
So just...tell him in five years.

376
00:17:12,303 --> 00:17:13,243
You did what?!

377
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,067
Make that 20 years.

378
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,743
Honey, that was a long time ago.

379
00:17:23,296 --> 00:17:24,495
Why are you still living here?!

380
00:17:24,496 --> 00:17:26,694
Because I've got nowhere else to go!

381
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,727
Sorry.

382
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:34,032
But still, what if I want to tell him?

383
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:36,326
Well, that's up to you, isn't it?

384
00:17:36,327 --> 00:17:38,047
Got to go.

385
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:41,945
Damn beads.

386
00:17:52,162 --> 00:17:54,566
Yuk it up, I don't care.
I'm getting the last laugh!

387
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:57,030
'Cause my brother's
waiting for me downstairs

388
00:17:57,031 --> 00:17:59,303
and when these elevator
doors open, you'll see,

389
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:01,410
he's gonna be staring
right at you two guys.

390
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,693
Okay, I don't know what I
thought was gonna happen,

391
00:18:07,694 --> 00:18:09,642
but I think we can all agree
that this isn't working out,

392
00:18:09,643 --> 00:18:13,133
it's costing me a tremendous amount of time
and effort, so let's just call it a draw.

393
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:15,559
Hell, no! You lost. Live with it.

394
00:18:15,821 --> 00:18:17,820
It's hard when you
lose for the first time.

395
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:20,476
It's even harder  when
it's the hundredth time

396
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,514
- Say it.
- You're always right.

397
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:27,829
I know! But it is still
so nice to hear it.

398
00:18:29,134 --> 00:18:30,225
How did you know that he was lying?

399
00:18:30,226 --> 00:18:33,824
Well, you said that he
wasn't; and as a rule,

400
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:37,407
I always take whatever you say and just
go in the exact opposite direction with it.

401
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,227
But, more than that, Barbie,
the main reason is because...

402
00:18:40,228 --> 00:18:45,023
well, lookit, medicine is all
about experience. Hell, wouldja...

403
00:18:46,284 --> 00:18:50,425
wouldja like to go ahead and have a look at
who the last doctor was to give Thompson drugs?

404
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:53,314
You?

405
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:54,477
Oh!

406
00:18:54,478 --> 00:18:56,370
Why didn't you say something earlier?

407
00:18:56,371 --> 00:18:59,463
What, give up my front-row
seat to Barbie's Wild Ride?

408
00:18:59,464 --> 00:19:05,103
"He's a drug addict! He's not a drug
addict! You-make-me-doubt-my-self!

409
00:19:09,752 --> 00:19:12,613
"You're more interested in being
right than doing what's right!

410
00:19:12,614 --> 00:19:15,360
And I just couldn't take
it! Can't take it anymore!"

411
00:19:23,017 --> 00:19:24,637
And yet sometimes
losing is a good thing.

412
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:28,789
Like, for instance, when
you lose your insecurities

413
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,447
about the guy you're marrying,

414
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:31,736
which makes it a whole lot easier

415
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,336
to cut him some slack once in a while.

416
00:19:33,337 --> 00:19:34,634
Go ahead, look.

417
00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:35,760
Really, baby?

418
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:37,537
Yeah. Besides, you're
cutting up your napkin.

419
00:19:42,594 --> 00:19:43,885
I guess you can never underestimate

420
00:19:43,886 --> 00:19:45,244
how the smallest gesture

421
00:19:45,245 --> 00:19:47,044
can make everything better.

422
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:48,474
You know, for a minute there,

423
00:19:48,475 --> 00:19:49,959
I actually thought
you had a twin brother.

424
00:19:50,905 --> 00:19:53,712
Really? Was it when my
twin brother was here?

425
00:19:53,713 --> 00:19:55,715
-Stop it.
-Sorry.

426
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:00,295
Too much.
