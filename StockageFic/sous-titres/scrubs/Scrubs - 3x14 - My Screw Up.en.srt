{1}{1}23.976
{42}{107}"As a doctor, there are certain procedures you just have a gift for."
{107}{169}Oh. That feels so good. Right there. Yeah.
{194}{207}Let's have the other foot.
{207}{227}NO!
{263}{331}Umm. It's just that there is|something wrong with my left foot.
{369}{428}You guys would think its really disgusting.
{428}{519}I'm a surgeon. I cut people open. / I'm a doctor.|This has been in people.
{519}{639}Okay. I have a huge bunion.
{725}{780}Sean's coming back in a few weeks.|What am I supposed to do?
{792}{912}Well I think the obvious answer, is to draw Sean's face on it,|and tell him you grew it because you missed him.
{929}{967}Or...it's a simple surgery.
{967}{1040}Uhhh Turk, I think we already|decided on Bunion-face.
{1068}{1089}Cut me the hell up.
{1089}{1115}Dammit.
{1171}{1194}Thanks Nurse Espinoza.
{1194}{1327}Turk? If I decide to keep my last name|after we get married, that's no big deal right?
{1333}{1389}Course not baby. We'll just have|one of those modern marriages
{1389}{1461}where the husband and wife|don't love each other.
{1465}{1547}Turk! Wait! Turk! Turk! Whoah!
{1579}{1603}You okay?
{1603}{1625}All good.
{1652}{1737}It's Jack's first birthday, I want it|to be special. I got a petting zoo for the kids.
{1738}{1788}And we need to figure out|something great for the adults.
{1794}{1903}How about a Russian Roulette booth? And here's|the kicker. We put bullets in all the chambers.
{1903}{1954}That way everybody wins!
{1954}{2032}Will there be a pinata? Beause I need to know|if I should bring my pinata helmet.
{2032}{2107}Would you zip it nerd? The only reason I invited you is because
{2107}{2213}For some reason, you have your own Sponge-Bob Squarepants costume.
{2213}{2244}It was a gift.
{2244}{2284}"From me to me."
{2284}{2380}Anyhoo. I'm thinking that|you probably shouldn't come.
{2380}{2404}Why not?
{2404}{2449}Because her whole family is in town.
{2485}{2506}Hey JD.
{2506}{2538}"Oh my god! What do you say to a girl"
{2539}{2589}"you dumped three weeks ago?"
{2589}{2630}I destroyed that video tape we made.
{2630}{2668}What tape?
{2814}{2882}Danni, if you don't look concerned,|no one in America's Funniest Home Videos
{2883}{2924}Is going to think this is real.
{2924}{2981}Can't we just go|home and have sex?
{2981}{3020}No! Again from the top.
{3071}{3107}Now I'll never meet Bob Saggat.
{3244}{3292}So is their brother Ben|coming to this thing too?
{3292}{3354}Oh yeah. He always has to|make some grand entrance
{3354}{3412}that he just winds up depressed afterwards.
{3412}{3426}Why is that?
{3494}{3538}Cause he never surprises us.
{3538}{3558}Even a little bit?
{3558}{3571}No.
{3571}{3605}Thorns! Ah! Augh! Ow! Ouch! Ah!
{3605}{3749}Oh. Bloody. That's good. Now this time try and|do it with your head in a sort of a less jarring position.
{3750}{3787}I can't!
{3788}{3821}That's perfect.
{3833}{3882}Scrubs 3x14: My Screw-Up.
{4154}{4181}I'm a prickly pear.
{4253}{4301}Can I see that for one second?|Thanks.
{4461}{4499}Not a strong moment for you Polly.
{4499}{4548}I need to get it started first.
{4599}{4673}So you still doing the whole kooky guy who |brings his camera everywhere thing?
{4673}{4697}Till the day I die.
{4698}{4723}Uh-huh.
{4725}{4770}Is this thing made of Teflon?
{4783}{4888}You know something? You have slept with both of my sisters.
{4898}{5006}That means you and I have something in common.
{5061}{5124}I have to get going.
{5126}{5151}To weird?
{5152}{5199}Nahhhhhhh!
{5196}{5284}What's weird is that its taken my best friend so long to come and see my son.
{5278}{5355}I mean you get diagnosed with leukemia and then you disappear for two years. 
{5355}{5389}What is that about?
{5389}{5516}Well, it went into remission and I wanted to see |the world in all its splendor and glory.
{5516}{5536}How'd that go for you?
{5537}{5608}Ehh. Got some good picture though. Here check it out.
{5609}{5686}Look. Here's me at the Great Wall of China.
{5687}{5760}This is me at the pyramids.
{5761}{5858}What is this? Oh yeah. This was|you and me, like eight seconds ago.
{5859}{5963}So Jorden tells me that while you were on your world leukemia tour,
{5963}{6007}you neglected to visit a single doctor,
{6007}{6089}medicine man, or scary shaman with the giant saucers in his ears.
{6089}{6216}Psst. Ben. Turns out cancer's the kind of ailment
{6217}{6283}that you occasionally want to check up on.
{6284}{6325}Fine. I'll get the exam.
{6361}{6461}Tell you what. I missed the hell out of you. I did.
{6462}{6537}Thanks Perry. I missed you to.
{6695}{6771}Damn! Doh oh oh oh! Ha ha ha ha ha!
{6772}{6837}YEAH! I AM THE KING OF GAY CHICKEN!
{6837}{6895}You deceiving...
{6978}{7054}You know Elliot you are eventually going |to have to take off your sock.
{7055}{7093}If I do, then from now on when one of you guys
{7094}{7140}look at me all you're going to think|of me as giant gross foot.
{7141}{7214}It's like that security guard with the hook for the hand. 
{7215}{7282}All everybody thinks when they look at him is, big giant afro.
{7283}{7329}I do think that.
{7330}{7352}Okay you know what?
{7353}{7429}Maybe it would be better if you focused on |how you are doing this for Sean.
{7429}{7514}I mean if there was something about me|physically that bothered Carla,
{7515}{7575}I would be excited to fix it for her.
{7576}{7615}I mean it would probably make our relationship even better.
{7616}{7634}And more...
{7635}{7651}I hate your mole.
{7652}{7670}What?
{7671}{7703}What?
{7714}{7787}Baby you said it was your tickle button.
{7787}{7828}You made me shave my mustache.
{7829}{7882}That was before I knew what was under there.
{8060}{8154}{Y:i}Whew. Finally a brother can breath.
{8185}{8241}{Y:i}Hello there.
{8353}{8402}You wanna quit? Then quit!
{8403}{8461}But you sir are a Worthless Peon!
{8462}{8522}And you will always|will be a Worthless Peon!
{8550}{8617}Sir you know my band? The Worthless Peons.
{8618}{8700}Well Chris from shipping and receiving wants to go solo.
{8700}{8757}We lose him, we lose our sex appeal.
{8758}{8831}He's the only one with hair. What do you think I should do?
{8831}{8899}Ted you know my rule about personal problems.
{8900}{8966}I'm not interested unless it involves my loved ones.
{8967}{9014}Or possibly my wife.
{9015}{9050}Doodle all your stuff to that.
{9098}{9181}Awwwwwwwwwwwwww. Let me powder my head first.
{9182}{9258}So should I be worried about the old ticker?
{9259}{9311}Oh Mr. Taylor. Let me worry about that for you.
{9312}{9369}{Y:i}Oh my god! He's gonna die!
{9370}{9427}Ah Newbie. Perfect timing.
{9428}{9491}I have to run a hundred fifty dollars |down to the police station
{9492}{9534}cause Mr. Jinkies the Juggler,
{9534}{9594}who jordan just has to have to |for Jack's birthday party,
{9595}{9636}just got a DUI.
{9636}{9656}Yeah!
{9656}{9691}Only me. Long story short.
{9692}{9766}Your new job is to take young Ben here by the hand
{9766}{9832}and run every hematological screening test that we have.
{9833}{9887}Dr. Cox I can't. I'm already covering for Doug.
{9888}{9936}He's on a His-and-Her-Spa-Day with his mom.
{9937}{9953}WHAT?!
{9954}{9996}Don't ask. The point is, I'm swamped.
{9996}{10056}And I'm a little worried about Mr. Taylor here.
{10057}{10104}Hiiiiii.|Mr. Taylor.
{10105}{10162}For the life of me, I can't figure out his irregular heartbeat.
{10162}{10248}I already looked at his EKG, Newbie, and trust me.
{10249}{10300}He's not gonna die in the next thirty minutes.
{10301}{10380}Now. Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
{10380}{10521}Hey JD. My sister Danni is more of a gentle kisser, don't you think?
{10522}{10642}But I find jordan is loaded more along the lines of teeth and tongue.
{10643}{10678}Would you please stop it.
{10679}{10701}Fangs.
{10739}{10828}This guy is supposed to be a great plastic surgeon.
{10829}{10962}Okaaaaaaaaaaaay. So who wants what, bigger or smaller?
{10963}{11034}My fiance' would like to have his mole removed.
{11035}{11106}That? That's cute. It's like a tickle button.
{11107}{11162}No it's not. It needs to go away.
{11163}{11274}All right. I'll scrap it away and we'll cover it with |skin from the backside of your prothiosis
{11275}{11320}So you would be a butt-face.
{11321}{11349}That would be a funny nickname.
{11349}{11371}No it wouldn't.
{11372}{11391}Yes it would.
{11392}{11454}God, how long does it take, to fill a bottle of pills!
{11455}{11538}I'm sorry Madeline. I hope we didn't wake you.
{11539}{11595}It's just that I have fifty patients and I...
{11625}{11666}That's a code
{11667}{11739}Watch I'm going to get out of this mole thing.
{11740}{11770}Whatever, Butt-face.
{11771}{11807}Uncool.
{11863}{11970}Sir, I think I figured out how my problem affects one of your loved ones.
{11971}{12026}It affects me.
{12027}{12075}Swing and a miss.
{12104}{12212}Oh, thank god you're here. I totally need someone to talk to.
{12213}{12284}Usually I would talk to Dr. Cox, but he's out doing stuff.
{12285}{12334}Course there is always Laverne, but I'm kind of her boss.
{12335}{12387}And I like to avoid getting too up close and personal
{12388}{12421}with staff members who work below me.
{12422}{12456}As do I.
{12457}{12512}See, it's just that I told Turk I didn't like his mole,
{12513}{12561}and I feel guilty now.
{12562}{12628}You've seen it, you can't avoid it.
{12748}{12838}Dr. Cox. Ah. I'm afraid my band lost a member.
{12839}{12927}So we're not going to be able to|perform at your son's party.
{12929}{13006}Ted. Now even though I never asked you to,
{13006}{13062}that is still just ter-ific news.
{13063}{13119}That hurt here, 
{13120}{13140}and here.
{13215}{13240}Dr. Cox.
{13241}{13289}What's the matter with you there Sheila?
{13290}{13332}You look like Maybaline just went belly up.
{13332}{13408}Twenty minutes after you left he went into cardiac arrest.
{13454}{13483}We tried to resuscitate him,
{13484}{13524}but there was nothing we could do.
{13588}{13619}I'm sorry.
{13645}{13689}Whoa man. Bummer.
{13689}{13733}This shouldn't have happened.
{13734}{13788}{Y:i}Guilt's a funny thing. It can lead to denial.
{13789}{13826}Kid screwed up.
{13827}{13926}No he didn't. He told you he has way |too many patients, he's swamped.
{13927}{13983}The kid screwed up.
{13984}{14020}Okay.
{14021}{14058}Darn kid!
{14059}{14109}{Y:i}Guilt can lead to compromise.
{14110}{14213}Turk is doing this sweet thing for me, you know?
{14214}{14236}Men's room!
{14237}{14274}Whoa! Hey!
{14275}{14347}I just wish there was something I could do for him.
{14348}{14466}Know what sweetie? I'm fine with getting rid of this mole.
{14467}{14536}But you got to be willing to take my last |name when we get married.
{14537}{14604}That's perfect. Of course I will.
{14675}{14751}And there she goes. Mrs. Carla Butt-face.
{14752}{14808}Dammit.
{14809}{14893}But as a doctor, you are around death so much you get used to the guilt.
{14894}{14924}And you learn how not to let it keep
{14925}{14979}from affecting your personal relationships.
{14980}{15006}Brace yourself.
{15007}{15055}What are you still doing here?
{15056}{15089}I'm on call tonight.
{15089}{15159}Not anymore. I'm taking all your patients.
{15160}{15211}So wait. You think this was my fault?
{15211}{15272}Hey, this is an emotional situation.
{15273}{15308}So, why don't you go easy on the kid?
{15308}{15365}It was your fault. Now get the hell out.
{15406}{15455}Well that was good. That was good listening.
{15456}{15475}Kev.
{15476}{15499}Yup.
{15654}{15701}Beep-beep-beep. Beep-beep-beep.
{15701}{15747}Beep-beep-beep. Beep-beep-beep.
{15747}{15792}Beep-beep-beep. Beep-beep-beep.
{15793}{15826}I got it. I got it.
{15827}{15849}All the best.
{15850}{15873}Thanks man.
{15874}{15979}I tell you what. Nothing says good morning |like a drunken human alarm clock.
{15980}{16119}Hey. You've been here for sixty straight hours. |You need to go home.
{16120}{16156}You know what I need.
{16157}{16222}I need people to stop telling me what I should do.
{16223}{16259}Fine.
{16289}{16328}You know what you should do?
{16329}{16361}Aw. Why are you here?
{16362}{16422}Dr. Cox. Can I talk to you for a second?
{16423}{16503}Hey, hey, Val. You know, you know what's funny?
{16503}{16621}Ever since I started taking care of your patients not one of them has died.
{16622}{16696} Look. You want to be mad at me, that's fine. I get it.
{16697}{16734}Okay. But jordan called.
{16735}{16784}And she wants to make sure you show this afternoon.
{16785}{16832}Oh. Right. That thing. Put us down for Ben plus one.
{16833}{16882}I'm not going anywhere. So beat it.
{16961}{17006}You guys, I don't want to do this.
{17007}{17058}Come on. No one's going to call you names.
{17058}{17079}I know, but...
{17080}{17097}FACE!
{17123}{17145}Butt-face.
{17145}{17245} Listen. My butt is fabulous. A slice of that up here,
{17246}{17286}that's just me spreading the wealth.
{17287}{17352}Still my mole is part of my identity.
{17353}{17413}I need you guys to convince Carla to get me out of this.
{17413}{17453} I can't man. I got things to do.
{17453}{17519}Like what? Dr. Cox took all your patients.
{17669}{17691}Gin.
{17692}{17712}Dammit. 
{17801}{17822}Nice Hand.
{17849}{17882} I meant the cards.
{17913}{17971} I got to win my money back from Leonard.
{17983}{18030}You know the guy with the giant afro.
{18031}{18072}Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
{18072}{18104}Oh right. Yeah.
{18105}{18145}I'll go talk to her for you.
{18146}{18214}Thank you. I hate her for doing this to me.
{18244}{18275} I hate him for doing this to me.
{18304}{18382}I don't think he understands that Espinoza is more than a name to me.
{18383}{18408}It's my heritage.
{18409}{18466}It's also a candy bar in Equador.
{18467}{18518}But mostly it's my heritage.
{18518}{18599}I just don't want to do this Dr. Kelso, but I already agreed.
{18600}{18646}What do you think I should do?
{18647}{18744}Well Nurse "Snickers", until now you've just been white noise.
{18745}{18786}But since you forced me to respond,
{18787}{18841}let me a tell you a couple of things that only a few people know.
{18889}{18967} I haven't paid my Country Club dues since |the third quarter of ninety-seven.
{18968}{19022}But I sill tee off every Wednesday at eight fifteen,
{19023}{19089}and take a bare-ass steam when the last putt drops.
{19090}{19245}But more importantly, I really don't care|about any of you or your problems.
{19246}{19287}And you can confirm that with Ted.
{19349}{19404}Don't those Espinoza's have nougat?
{19463}{19483}Can we go now?
{19484}{19499}No.
{19499}{19519}How about now?
{19520}{19581}No. Look as a rule of thumb I don't attend parties
{19582}{19625}where the guest of honor has no idea what's going on.
{19626}{19687}That's not true. Remember back when you and jordan first got married,
{19688}{19743}and we went to go see senile old Grandpa Horty
{19744}{19771}for his ninety fifth birthday party?
{19772}{19820}Remember he kept trying to get the coat-check girl 
{19821}{19877}thrown out because she was loyal to the Kaiser.
{19878}{19937}Benny, I appreciate your concern, but you just don't understand.
{19938}{19982}What don't I understand?
{19983}{20018}Well do you see all these people here?
{20019}{20088}This is not some kind of senior citizens slumber party.
{20088}{20184}I mean if it was, I would have already put Mr. |Foredom's hand in a nice bowl of warm water.
{20185}{20255}But god bless him, he's going to go ahead and wet the bed anyway.
{20256}{20356}My, my point is, is that if I'm not here, people die.
{20357}{20426}If I'm not here, people die.
{20427}{20467}Come on!
{20468}{20619} Listen why don't you just let me take this |little mental breakdown of yours.
{20620}{20692}I'm going to put it right here, in my pocket.
{20692}{20756}And that way you can piss off for the afternoon,
{20757}{20796}and you can let one of the other nine-thousand
{20797}{20833}other doctors around here take care of things for you.
{20834}{20923}So you haven't noticed that my supporting cast in this theater of hell,
{20924}{20983}is a veritable who's who of incompetent puppets.
{20984}{21112}So sorry to bother you Dr. Cox. But I have searched high and low
{21113}{21164}for Carla. And honestly, it is like she has gone poof! 
{21165}{21271}And like disappeared into thin air. Heh. Have you seen her?
{21272}{21327}No.
{21328}{21399}No. I haven't seen her.
{21400}{21481}Well if you do. Ummm. Page me.
{21530}{21586}Oh, Ben. Outstanding commitment.
{21587}{21665} Thanks. So, can we go now?
{21665}{21712}Provided that gets you off my back.
{21713}{21755}One more thing.
{21785}{21792}Oh, come on.
{21962}{21991}You got to forgive him.
{22050}{22121}What? They're my shower shorts.
{22147}{22192}Thanks again for helping me look for Carla.
{22192}{22236}No problem. I'll check the dumpster.
{22237}{22316}Ah, we're not looking for dead Carla.
{22317}{22366}That a girl. You stay optimistic.
{22573}{22677}Ahem. Sorry sir. It's been an emotional couple of days.
{22678}{22759}I'm just here to, ah
{22760}{22782}get a nasal speculum.
{22783}{22860}I just wish I didn't hate that mole so much.
{22959}{23073}I used one of these on my wife once. She's a terrible snorer.
{23074}{23146}Used to keep me up all night. I made her have the surgery.
{23147}{23224}Course that only made things worse. Here's the twist.
{23225}{23294}Now, whenever she goes out of town,
{23295}{23357}I can't fall asleep without the sound of that gasping,
{23358}{23440}wheezing woman lying right next to me. Trust me.
{23441}{23505}If I ever met a Japan air stewardess who snores like Enid,
{23506}{23556}I'd marry her tomorrow.
{23613}{23643}But here's the point.
{23677}{23737}You might find out that thing you hate so much,
{23737}{23848}is the very same thing you miss when it's gone.
{23919}{23960}Thank you sir.
{24129}{24169}All right, I'm gonna get right down to it.
{24170}{24270}You tell Carla that my mole is inoperable, I will pay you ten thousand dollars.
{24271}{24317}Turk! I don't want you to do this!
{24318}{24352}The mole's inoperable.
{24353}{24375}The deal's off.
{24376}{24394}Ow!
{24395}{24429}I couldn't find her.
{24430}{24451}Don't sweat it.
{24452}{24479}See ya!
{24509}{24572}Great an open surgery slot just gone to waste.
{24609}{24638}Not necessarily.
{24724}{24785}Look at this.
{24786}{24818}Waugh!
{24819}{24844}Oh.
{24947}{24988}Those are the most ridiculous things I have ever seen.
{24989}{25060}You know you're right. I was an idiot to buy these shower shorts.
{25060}{25133}I mean it's not like they come with a complimentary shower wallet.
{25134}{25186}Ow.
{25187}{25259}Look I just want to say. That what happened.
{25260}{25365}Wasn't your fault. And I'm sorry.
{25385}{25465}Thanks. I really need to hear that.
{25465}{25552}Good. Fun. Let's get dressed and go.
{25553}{25607}Shower Shortz?
{25607}{25706}For the man who has nothing to hide. But still wants to.
{25782}{25830}{Y:i}Acceptance can take a lot of different forms.
{25875}{25957}{Y:i}Whether it's accepting that it's okay to show |your soft side every once in a while.
{25958}{26030}Well its official. Chris left the band.
{26031}{26066}Well Ted, you know what I think?
{26067}{26126}Good riddance to him. You'll find another tenor.
{26147}{26176}Thank you sir.
{26176}{26262} If you don't, who cares? You all stink anyway.
{26343}{26418}{Y:i}Or accepting someone you love for just the way they are.
{26419}{26476}Can you tie my tie, Mrs. Espinoza?
{26540}{26569}{Y:i}Answer him!
{26799}{26826}You just kissed my mole.
{26887}{26925}So how come you don't have to get all dressed up?
{26925}{26972} I am dressed up. You see any holes in these pants?
{26973}{26988}No.
{26989}{27103} I'm glad you made it. Listen. There is one |more thing you have to do for me.
{27104}{27145}You can't keep me from getting drunk.
{27171}{27243}You have to forgive yourself for everything |that went down the other day.
{27293}{27321}You are so annoying.
{27322}{27357}Yeah.
{27393}{27425}Okay.
{27426}{27455}Good.
{27496}{27526}Now where is your camera?
{27527}{27572}Aren't, aren't you going to take some pictures?
{27597}{27641}Pictures of what?
{27642}{27718}You know. Crying babies. Covered in chocolate.
{27719}{27769}People singing happy birthday to my son,
{27770}{27838}who've never even met him before. You know, the whole routine.
{27896}{27931}Where do you think we are?
{29275}{29319}{Y:i}But in the end, the most important thing to accept,
{29320}{29359}{Y:i}is that no matter how alone you feel,
{29360}{29545}{Y:i}how painful it may be, with the help of those around you,
{29546}{29633}{Y:i}you'll get through this too.
