1
00:00:01,531 --> 00:00:04,377
"Today I walk in here not as
a resident but as a chief. "

2
00:00:04,478 --> 00:00:08,629
"Chief resident! Chief resident Dorian!
Chiefy chiefy chief!"

3
00:00:08,664 --> 00:00:10,791
What's that, your new, uh
cool guy walk?

4
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:12,976
No, I have rocks in my shoe.

5
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:16,244
"Wow, that's a lot of rocks. "

6
00:00:16,445 --> 00:00:19,299
"I gotta stop taking that short-cut
through the quarry. "

7
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:23,542
"Anyway, the best thing about my new job
is that I command a lot more respect. "

8
00:00:23,643 --> 00:00:27,694
Chief resident in the house!
Everybody say hey-ay!

9
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:32,195
"Even though Councilman Donovan
was handcuffed to that chair"

10
00:00:32,196 --> 00:00:34,741
"because once again he was
flying high on crystal meth,"

11
00:00:34,742 --> 00:00:36,354
"his respect felt good. "

12
00:00:36,455 --> 00:00:38,644
"Honestly, it's the reason
I keep voting for him. "

13
00:00:38,845 --> 00:00:39,769
Have a good day.

14
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,012
Try not to torture anyone so much
that they take their own lives.

15
00:00:43,013 --> 00:00:43,813
I'll try.

16
00:00:43,814 --> 00:00:47,511
You know, you're not looking as processed
and overly-medicated as usual.

17
00:00:47,512 --> 00:00:49,411
That is so sweet!

18
00:00:49,412 --> 00:00:50,368
Come here!

19
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:52,137
"It was the same old Dr. Cox and Jordan. "

20
00:00:52,138 --> 00:00:56,278
"The weird thing was, there was something
underneath it... they were happy. "

21
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:59,535
We have some very exciting news.

22
00:00:59,536 --> 00:01:02,763
Don't tell me... You and Sweaty Teddy
here are gonna finally have

23
00:01:02,778 --> 00:01:04,975
that commitment ceremony
you've been dreaming about?

24
00:01:04,976 --> 00:01:06,776
Perry, even if I went that way...
and believe me,

25
00:01:06,777 --> 00:01:09,258
there were nights in the service
when it didn't sound so far-fetched

26
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:11,168
Ted is hardly my type.

27
00:01:11,169 --> 00:01:13,236
I beg to differ. I've seen Enid.

28
00:01:13,237 --> 00:01:14,889
- What?
- Nothing.

29
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,322
Dr. Cox, remember a few years back,

30
00:01:17,323 --> 00:01:20,497
you asked me to look over your
divorce papers to make sure

31
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:23,645
"that slag would die
a penniless whore"?

32
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:26,467
Sorry.

33
00:01:26,468 --> 00:01:29,762
It's okay, "slag" is kind of
his pet-name for me.

34
00:01:30,063 --> 00:01:34,047
Anyway, I was also going
through a divorce...

35
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:36,061
she's with my brother now;

36
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:39,576
he's nine inches shorter than me
but he wears a piece...

37
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:44,130
The point is, you and I
signed the wrong papers,

38
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:47,932
which technically means you two
are still married and so am I.

39
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:50,601
Well, mazel tovs all around!

40
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:54,814
"I've never seen Dr. Cox and Jordan
speechless before. "

41
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,115
"It was neat-o!"

42
00:01:57,247 --> 00:01:59,807
Just so you know,
I think this chief resident thing

43
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,087
has made you a little
too big for your britches?

44
00:02:02,187 --> 00:02:05,116
Soo... from now on I'm gonna be
your britches shrinker.

45
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:09,089
Oh, what, is that supposed to
intimidate me or something?

46
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,920
No. I had to do it anyway.

47
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:13,915
What possible reason could you have
for breaking your broom in half?

48
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,202
Thanks, bro.

49
00:02:19,426 --> 00:02:21,355
Any other questions? Smart guy?

50
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,516
What's up, ladies.

51
00:02:44,842 --> 00:02:46,480
What's up with these rocks!?

52
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:49,036
HAH! You've been graveled!

53
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:50,059
"Graveled"?

54
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,723
It's a new game I made up this morning
when I had rocks in my shoes.

55
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:54,772
I like it.

56
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:56,972
Better than Play-Doh Pants?

57
00:02:56,973 --> 00:02:58,945
Play-Doh Pants became
all about the money.

58
00:02:58,946 --> 00:02:59,946
Wise!

59
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:01,567
"It felt good cheering Turk up. "

60
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:02,768
"See, now that I'm chief studly,"

61
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:04,910
"I was making a lot more
money than him. "

62
00:03:04,911 --> 00:03:07,630
"Needless to say it was a time
to be extra sensitive. "

63
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:08,931
Hey, you remember how I make
more money than you now?

64
00:03:09,032 --> 00:03:11,190
Here's five bucks for remembering.

65
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,148
Anyway, I was thinking about
spending some of my extra ducats

66
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:15,670
on one of those classy suits
we always wanted!

67
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:18,806
You mean the leather purple jumpsuit
Eddie Murphy wore in 'Raw'?

68
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:20,440
- You know it, dawg!
- That's cold!

69
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:21,961
Look, I gotta go.

70
00:03:21,962 --> 00:03:23,996
I've got a new attending and
he hates it when we're late.

71
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:26,959
- Plus he's a question-talker.
- What's a question-talker?

72
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,480
Do I want you to be on time, Dr. Turk?

73
00:03:29,481 --> 00:03:30,481
Yes I do.

74
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:33,411
Am I going to remember this?
Of course I am.

75
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,624
Miss Myers is ready to have
her bandages removed now.

76
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,199
Who do you mean, dashboard-face?

77
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,451
Yeah, I think she prefers "Miss Myers. "

78
00:03:42,452 --> 00:03:44,341
Well then she probably shouldn't
be checking her e-mail

79
00:03:44,342 --> 00:03:45,952
while she's driving ninety miles an hour.

80
00:03:45,953 --> 00:03:48,219
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- We weren't waiting for you.

81
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,642
Great! I'm on time!

82
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:50,907
See, I think as a psychiatrist

83
00:03:50,974 --> 00:03:53,559
that I should be there when
Miss Myers' bandages get removed,

84
00:03:53,574 --> 00:03:55,701
because her accident was
traumatic enough.

85
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,189
But with reconstructive facial
surgery on top of that?

86
00:03:58,677 --> 00:04:00,770
In my professional opinion: Yikes!

87
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:02,379
Honey, if you are coming in,

88
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,002
I just might go ahead and phone up
my pool-man and my architect

89
00:04:05,003 --> 00:04:08,208
so we can populate the room with
just as many useless people as possible.

90
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:10,520
Great! My mom's in town, should I call her?

91
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,913
That was good.

92
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:19,729
Okay, Miss Myers, I'm gonna go ahead
and get these bandages off

93
00:04:19,764 --> 00:04:22,072
and make sure the plastic surgeons
have left your face

94
00:04:22,107 --> 00:04:23,552
just as beautiful as it always was.

95
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:26,802
Oh, you're so nice. Are you married?

96
00:04:27,022 --> 00:04:29,124
Oh! He is as of this morning!

97
00:04:29,715 --> 00:04:32,740
- Really? I thought he was divorced?
- No, child, the papers didn't go through!

98
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:33,741
You know what?

99
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:38,865
I've got a son, I don't fantasize about
Jordan dying as much anymore, and,

100
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:40,451
even though it wasn't planned,

101
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:43,612
I'm actually pretty happy about the way
this whole marriage thing has worked out.

102
00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:47,881
Sooo, would you please stop your chirping
and step away from my personal life?

103
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:50,704
- So what's his wife like?
- So scary!

104
00:04:52,114 --> 00:04:54,635
You go ahead and have a look there.

105
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,075
You look fantastic, you do.

106
00:04:59,876 --> 00:05:00,901
Doctor?

107
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,076
Really fantastic.

108
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:07,176
Thank God you were here!

109
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,355
"Since Elliot and I
are both chief residents,"

110
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:13,258
"I'm trying not to make it
all about me. "

111
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:14,611
John Dorian, Chief Resident.

112
00:05:14,612 --> 00:05:16,396
"You know, unless there's someone I could doink. "

113
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,829
Hey, uh, you need to move your car...
it's my day to have the parking spot.

114
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,460
J.D., you have a scooter!
Why do you even need a parking spot?

115
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:25,760
Mmmm, it sends a message.

116
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:28,177
"Just because I lured her away
from her perfect boyfriend"

117
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:31,151
"and then dumped her doesn't mean
my scooter, Sasha, needs to suffer. "

118
00:05:32,252 --> 00:05:33,774
What are you doing?

119
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:37,555
Just making it official.
Chief. Co-Chief.

120
00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:41,156
You can try as hard as you want,
that is never gonna stick.

121
00:05:41,357 --> 00:05:44,038
And that's Co-Chief Resident Dorian over there!

122
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,469
Dammit! You are quick!

123
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:53,408
Dammit, I got an appendectomy again?

124
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:58,064
Sweet! I get the duah... d...
duoh... duo... duooh...

125
00:05:58,065 --> 00:06:00,630
Duodenojejunostomy, man.
What's wrong with you?

126
00:06:00,631 --> 00:06:01,939
So I can't pronounce it.

127
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,042
Try and be a little more sensitive, okay?

128
00:06:04,043 --> 00:06:06,861
New bra, Janice? 'Cause it's working!

129
00:06:06,862 --> 00:06:10,017
Besides, the only reason I'm getting
all these great procedures

130
00:06:10,052 --> 00:06:12,342
is because nobody's died on me
in like three months!

131
00:06:12,343 --> 00:06:15,715
Listen, man, you never have to apologize
for being on a hot-streak.

132
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:16,715
I'm psyched for you!

133
00:06:16,716 --> 00:06:19,242
And I wouldn't take those procedures
away even if I could.

134
00:06:19,243 --> 00:06:23,063
Sir, would you mind giving me
the duodenojejunostomy instead of the Todd?

135
00:06:23,852 --> 00:06:26,537
Am I impressed by your moxie?
You bet'cha.

136
00:06:26,538 --> 00:06:29,296
Am I going to reward it?
Not a chance.

137
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,073
This Todd thing is killing me.
Where's your lunch?

138
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:38,879
Thank you, Barry! Hey!
That's for Barry Jr.!

139
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,299
What? The little guy's in leg braces.

140
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:49,165
I visited my safety deposit box today.
Guess what I found?

141
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,911
My grandfather's purple heart!

142
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:53,813
Please, I sold that years ago
to pay for these.

143
00:06:55,563 --> 00:06:57,179
Our wedding rings.

144
00:06:57,575 --> 00:07:00,553
- Holy cow!
- What do you think?

145
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,684
Are you kidding me?
I'm gonna wear this the rest of my life!

146
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,554
"Of course, marriage can make
the rest of your life seem longer. "

147
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:10,222
So you're just going to, uh,

148
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:12,048
fall asleep right after for
the rest of my life?

149
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:18,729
So I'm supposed to pay for
your Botox the rest of my life?

150
00:07:24,793 --> 00:07:27,138
I'm not sure I want
to watch you drink a beer

151
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:28,948
while I'm holding the baby
for the rest of my life!

152
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,414
Look, Attila... there's no way in hell
that I'm gonna listen to you complain

153
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:38,582
about the rest of your life
for the rest of my life, you got that?

154
00:07:38,783 --> 00:07:39,690
Yeah, not listening.

155
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:41,472
By the way, now that
we're married again,

156
00:07:41,473 --> 00:07:43,505
we've gotta make out new wills
in case one of us dies.

157
00:07:43,706 --> 00:07:45,951
Oh, God, I hope it's me.

158
00:07:46,547 --> 00:07:49,102
"Yep, there was definitely trouble in paradise. "

159
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:52,243
Would Co-Chief Dorian please
report to the I.C.U.?

160
00:07:52,244 --> 00:07:55,200
Co-Chief Dorian? Co-Chief?

161
00:07:56,797 --> 00:08:00,614
Well, Mrs. Covello, your CAT-scan
showed a small rectal tumor,

162
00:08:00,615 --> 00:08:02,913
so I want to schedule
a low anterior resection.

163
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:05,922
But don't worry, we have an
amazing surgical team here, okay?

164
00:08:06,023 --> 00:08:10,384
That means a lot coming from
the co-chief resident!

165
00:08:10,785 --> 00:08:13,939
"How did she hear?
She's been in a coma for two weeks!"

166
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,840
Dammit!

167
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:16,843
- Hey, buddy! Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

168
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:18,531
I know the Todd's doing her resection,

169
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:21,424
but if you send her down right now,
he's a little busy so it'd have to be me.

170
00:08:21,425 --> 00:08:22,437
What's the Todd doing?

171
00:08:22,438 --> 00:08:24,273
Yeah, well, you know the
city surveyor is outside

172
00:08:24,275 --> 00:08:27,120
taking pictures of the hospital
for the zoning commission?

173
00:08:27,121 --> 00:08:29,619
I told him they were shooting
a Sacred Heart calendar.

174
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,995
Gentlemen! Say hello to June!

175
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:39,016
How about a sneak-peek of July!

176
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,007
I don't know, Turk.

177
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:43,926
It's a little early for me
to start pulling strings...

178
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:47,311
I just got this co-chief job.
Dammit, now I'm saying it!

179
00:08:47,312 --> 00:08:49,323
Come on, man,
get me back in the game!

180
00:08:53,474 --> 00:08:55,947
You know what, here's ten bucks
for letting me help you out.

181
00:08:56,148 --> 00:08:57,848
Spend it wisely!

182
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,892
I think she's a little upset she doesn't
look the way she used to.

183
00:09:06,927 --> 00:09:08,943
Why? How did she used to look?

184
00:09:09,877 --> 00:09:10,858
Oh, dear ugly.

185
00:09:12,456 --> 00:09:15,057
Oh, whatta you know,
the paging of the shrew.

186
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,862
Look, why don't you just talk to her.

187
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:18,864
- Why don't you just...
- Mind my own business.

188
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:19,367
I know, your life is your life,

189
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:21,792
and it's not my job to fix it,
unless of course you ask me to.

190
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,256
And, man, would I get in there,
'cause I'm a good shrink

191
00:09:24,257 --> 00:09:27,190
and you my friend,
are a walking disaster.

192
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:29,003
Shall we?

193
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:34,497
So, now, Miss Myers, um,
how are you feeling?

194
00:09:34,498 --> 00:09:38,204
I was wondering... if it were possible
to have surgery again?

195
00:09:39,555 --> 00:09:41,496
Hi, sweetie, I'm in a tunnel.

196
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,875
Look, your body's been through
an enormous amount of trauma,

197
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,973
I can't recommend you
go racing back in to surgery.

198
00:09:46,974 --> 00:09:49,177
Now, I guarantee you,
if you just give it time

199
00:09:49,178 --> 00:09:51,050
you'll be happy with
the way you look.

200
00:09:51,051 --> 00:09:52,661
Oh, my God.

201
00:09:54,362 --> 00:09:55,461
WHAT!?

202
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,123
I just don't look like myself.

203
00:09:57,324 --> 00:09:59,608
I know I had a big nose and droopy eyes,

204
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:02,410
but they were "my" nose and
"my" droopy eyes, you know?

205
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:06,212
Tell me more about yourself.

206
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:10,142
"Around here, there's always at least
one person that'll come through for you. "

207
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,821
"In Turk's case, that was me. "

208
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,337
Hey, Elliot!

209
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:23,438
Hey, I want to talk to you
about this whole chief resident thing.

210
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:24,441
What about it?

211
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:27,311
Well, as you may have heard
from the loudspeaker,

212
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:30,520
some residents, the janitor,
my mother, your mother, and a...

213
00:10:30,521 --> 00:10:35,730
a coma patient, um, I'm being referred
to as the "co-" chief resident.

214
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:39,880
I think we should either both go
with "co-chief" or "chief. "

215
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:42,612
Don't you... co-agree?

216
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:43,434
Excuse me.

217
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:47,805
We're working up this patient for a
hypercoagulable state with a prolonged PTT?

218
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:48,677
What's our next step?

219
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:50,158
Well, that's easy, Lonnie,
what you want to do...

220
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,393
I'd like my answer from
the "chief" resident.

221
00:10:53,394 --> 00:10:57,651
We're both chief residents.
Isn't that right, Dr. Reid?

222
00:10:59,764 --> 00:11:03,091
With a prolonged PTT, you'd want to do
a one-to-one mixing study.

223
00:11:04,624 --> 00:11:06,051
That's why she's the chief.

224
00:11:06,134 --> 00:11:08,034
- You're the co-chief.
- Shut up, Lonnie!

225
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,235
You shut up!

226
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:15,960
Obviously for your ex-wife,
just the illusion of hair is important.

227
00:11:16,461 --> 00:11:17,874
Excuse me.

228
00:11:18,513 --> 00:11:21,769
So you're saying it had nothing to do
with my impotence?

229
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:25,316
Dr. Cox, I was wondering if we could
talk about Miss Myers in my office?

230
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,792
Yeah, I make it a point to
never enter a shrink's office

231
00:11:27,793 --> 00:11:30,024
unless I'm planning on
grossly overpaying somebody

232
00:11:30,025 --> 00:11:32,121
for telling me something that
I already know.

233
00:11:32,122 --> 00:11:34,416
Look, you're obviously really distracted
by the situation with your marriage...

234
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:36,718
Something I already know, what do I owe?
Will ten bucks cover it?

235
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:38,740
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, you're gonna hang onto that?

236
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:41,620
Yeah, you know, I forgot my lunch money,
and it's kielbasa day in the cafeteria.

237
00:11:41,655 --> 00:11:42,962
Kielbasa! Love it.

238
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:44,848
Anyway, Miss Myers really
values your opinion,

239
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:47,314
but I don't think you're even trying
to understand how she feels.

240
00:11:47,515 --> 00:11:51,425
Look, if I ever want your advice
on one of my patients, I'll ask.

241
00:11:51,426 --> 00:11:53,200
But do not hold your breath,

242
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:56,400
unless of course you can
hold it for a really long, long, long,

243
00:11:56,401 --> 00:12:00,036
long, long, long, long, long time.

244
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:01,693
I can't, I used to smoke.

245
00:12:04,694 --> 00:12:07,570
Kielbasa. Yes!

246
00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:10,706
- Let me buy you lunch.
- I'm rich.

247
00:12:10,707 --> 00:12:13,943
I'll buy you lunch and
some gold teeth to eat it with!

248
00:12:13,944 --> 00:12:17,147
You know, you only got one more
black joke this month before I bust your ass.

249
00:12:17,148 --> 00:12:19,662
Dammit! I used 'em all up
watching 'Barber Shop 9'.

250
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:21,514
Okay, that's it, and I'll get you later.

251
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:22,815
How'd surgery go?

252
00:12:22,816 --> 00:12:24,353
Oh, you know,
I was on top of my game.

253
00:12:24,354 --> 00:12:26,521
"It can be scary to stick
your neck out for a friend. "

254
00:12:26,522 --> 00:12:28,548
"That's why it's a huge relief
when they come through. "

255
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:29,644
How's she doing?

256
00:12:30,745 --> 00:12:32,864
Unfortunately she didn't make it.

257
00:12:35,675 --> 00:12:36,978
"What?"

258
00:12:40,143 --> 00:12:43,727
- What do you mean she died?
- I did everything I could.

259
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:45,172
Even my attending
thought I did great.

260
00:12:45,173 --> 00:12:47,122
He said, "Do I think you did great?
Yes I do!"

261
00:12:47,123 --> 00:12:50,153
"I couldn't help wonder if
by taking that patient from Todd"

262
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:52,881
"and giving her to Turk,
I had toyed with fate. "

263
00:12:52,882 --> 00:12:54,082
I know that look.

264
00:12:54,383 --> 00:12:56,590
You're wondering if you toyed with fate!

265
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:58,921
How could you know that look?
It's a brand new look!

266
00:12:58,922 --> 00:13:01,059
What do you think Todd
would've done that I didn't?

267
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,415
Doctor, her heart stopped.

268
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,404
No!

269
00:13:07,705 --> 00:13:08,955
Here!

270
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,167
I'm gay!

271
00:13:12,765 --> 00:13:14,357
I knew it.

272
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:16,863
Oh my God!

273
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:19,461
That's your "the Todd would've
pulled his own heart out" look!

274
00:13:19,462 --> 00:13:21,661
Okay, we have been spending
way too much time together.

275
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,755
Guess what there, wifey.

276
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:30,656
You can't be a pain in the ass
if I don't have a phone.

277
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:33,645
Oh, ohh! Hi, sweetie!

278
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:35,468
Save it.

279
00:13:35,469 --> 00:13:37,263
I was just calling to tell you
that I'm taking Jack

280
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:38,983
and staying at my mother's
for a few months.

281
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,497
But who's going to be
looking after him

282
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:42,762
when you and your mother
go out marauding for flesh?

283
00:13:42,763 --> 00:13:45,482
Thank you for making this
so much easier, Perry.

284
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,996
Jordan. Jordan, come on,
Jordan. Ahhh.

285
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:50,901
Are you okay?

286
00:13:51,002 --> 00:13:54,733
Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna go check
on Miss Myers.

287
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:56,947
Molly sent her down to surgery.

288
00:13:56,948 --> 00:13:59,538
Oh-ho-ho, wrong day, new chick!

289
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,984
"In a hospital, it's hard not
to let your personal life

290
00:14:01,985 --> 00:14:03,712
"affect your professional life. "

291
00:14:03,913 --> 00:14:05,454
"Forget about J.D."

292
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:08,188
"You're just as good as the Todd.
You got this. "

293
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:11,437
All right, people!
I believe we're done here.

294
00:14:12,355 --> 00:14:16,810
Did you just sew your gown
into the patient? Yeah, ya did.

295
00:14:18,907 --> 00:14:21,480
Hey! Hey, someone! Hey!

296
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:25,234
Randall was in the air conditioning vent,
and it collapsed on him! Buddy!

297
00:14:26,835 --> 00:14:29,131
Co-chief. Co-chief!

298
00:14:29,832 --> 00:14:32,919
Hey, you fixed him!
Come on, buddy!

299
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,420
"That's it!"

300
00:14:35,363 --> 00:14:37,751
Dr. Kelso, could you help me out?

301
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:40,568
People have been referring to me
as the co-chief resident.

302
00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:43,623
Well, it sounds like something you
should take up with the chief resident.

303
00:14:43,624 --> 00:14:45,280
But, "I'm" the chief resident.

304
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:48,533
Look, Dr. Reid's check is made out
to the chief resident,

305
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:50,876
and-and mine's made out
to the co-chief resident.

306
00:14:50,877 --> 00:14:52,370
But we both make the same amount.

307
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:53,224
You're right.

308
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,617
Dr. Reid, you should be making
ten dollars more a month,

309
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:58,383
and of course, Dr. Dorian,
you should be making ten dollars less.

310
00:14:58,384 --> 00:14:59,333
I know it's not much,

311
00:14:59,334 --> 00:15:01,918
but it's largely to symbolize
the difference in your levels.

312
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,888
- Coolio!
- Coolio, indeed.

313
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:07,291
"I could spend all day worrying
about what just happened,"

314
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:08,963
"but I have more important
things to do. "

315
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:14,750
Hey, man. Look what I confiscated
from one of the kids in Pediatrics.

316
00:15:15,851 --> 00:15:17,829
What, too hot?... Sorry.

317
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,628
Not in the mood!

318
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:21,829
Okay, well, look,
we both might have had bad days,

319
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:24,245
but I got just the thing
that's gonna cheer us up.

320
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:29,240
Ahhh? Dream come true, right!

321
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:31,583
Do you really think
I want this suit?

322
00:15:32,384 --> 00:15:35,551
Well, I do. But not from you!

323
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,193
Oh, now I get it.

324
00:15:38,194 --> 00:15:40,649
You're just mad because
I make more money than you.

325
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:43,826
No, I'm mad because of
that surgery today.

326
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,899
You doubted me.

327
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,664
You are such a wuss!

328
00:15:49,989 --> 00:15:51,546
Turk, come on.

329
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:56,187
Ah, these things chafe.

330
00:15:57,632 --> 00:15:59,773
Now I know why Eddie called it "Raw".

331
00:16:00,324 --> 00:16:03,085
Carla! Do you have any powder?

332
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:08,264
You. You went behind my back.

333
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,353
I gave you every opportunity
to do the right thing.

334
00:16:11,354 --> 00:16:12,924
I'll tell you what, there, Miss Manners:

335
00:16:12,925 --> 00:16:15,994
Why don't you go ahead and
gulp down that bear-sized bite,

336
00:16:15,995 --> 00:16:17,195
and then we'll talk.

337
00:16:33,656 --> 00:16:35,271
Yummy!

338
00:16:35,272 --> 00:16:38,315
Man, that is great kielbasa. But you can't
really screw up kielbasa, can you?

339
00:16:38,856 --> 00:16:40,675
So, um, where were we?

340
00:16:40,676 --> 00:16:42,915
Honest to God, I can't remember.

341
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,292
Oh, right, Miss Myers.

342
00:16:44,293 --> 00:16:46,910
The plastic surgeon said
it was safe to operate,

343
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:48,445
and Miss Myers really
liked her old face.

344
00:16:48,446 --> 00:16:50,607
And you don't have to be
a psychiatrist to see, Perry,

345
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,454
that if you used to be truly
happy and now you're not,

346
00:16:53,455 --> 00:16:55,810
then you should go back to the way
it was when you were happy.

347
00:16:56,495 --> 00:16:58,184
Isn't that what you would do?

348
00:16:59,281 --> 00:17:00,331
Yeah...

349
00:17:02,963 --> 00:17:04,077
Jordan!

350
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:06,862
Will you...

351
00:17:07,988 --> 00:17:09,436
will you divorce me?

352
00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:11,241
Ohh, I thought you'd never ask!

353
00:17:19,228 --> 00:17:22,958
Listen, I probably shoulda put a
stop to all this co-chief stuff.

354
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,676
What co-chief stuff?
I haven't even been thinking about it.

355
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,743
Look, J.D., ever since you dumped me,

356
00:17:27,744 --> 00:17:29,591
everyone around here's been treating
me like some kind of a victim.

357
00:17:29,592 --> 00:17:32,794
It's like, "Ohh, look at poor
Elliot going home alone. "

358
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:35,849
Or, "Ohh, look at poor Elliot riding
a tandem bike by herself. "

359
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:38,673
That's not something I normally do,

360
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:40,174
I just really wanted ice cream
the other night,

361
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:43,172
my car was out of gas, and that's
the bike the Gundersons loaned me.

362
00:17:45,072 --> 00:17:47,031
They do everything together...

363
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:48,603
Okay...

364
00:17:48,638 --> 00:17:52,564
The point is it was nice being the one
chief resident for a while, you know?

365
00:17:58,146 --> 00:18:00,488
She's got fingers like biceps!

366
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:08,816
And so, by the power vested in me
by the American Bar Association,

367
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:13,004
I pronounce you ex-husband
and ex-wife.

368
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:16,285
You may now do whatever
the hell you want!

369
00:18:18,111 --> 00:18:20,656
- I've never been this happy.
- Me neither.

370
00:18:21,657 --> 00:18:24,176
You have no chance of being normal.

371
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:34,829
Thirsty, huh?

372
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,617
Helps the tears taste less bitter.

373
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,018
Cheers.

374
00:18:40,311 --> 00:18:42,916
So! How you guys gonna
celebrate your divorce?

375
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:44,048
By not inviting you!

376
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:47,452
Oh my God! Dude! I doubted you for
a second, why are you so mad?

377
00:18:47,453 --> 00:18:49,294
Maybe I needed you to believe in me!

378
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,801
I believe in you, baby.

379
00:18:50,802 --> 00:18:52,386
Yeah, but we're married...
that doesn't count.

380
00:18:54,624 --> 00:18:57,087
What the? Ow, ow, ow, what?

381
00:18:57,088 --> 00:18:59,568
- Did you, uh...?
- Yeah, she's been graveled.

382
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:00,669
Nice work.

383
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:04,872
Look, man, it was one second
of doubt, okay?

384
00:19:05,716 --> 00:19:07,552
Since when do you care what
anybody else thinks?

385
00:19:07,653 --> 00:19:10,527
I don't. I care what you think.

386
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:12,864
Since the day I met you,

387
00:19:12,865 --> 00:19:16,359
you've treated me like I was the man,
like I could accomplish everything.

388
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,084
- This is gonna sound lame, but...
- I've got it!

389
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:26,820
your being like that's one of the
reasons I've gotten to where I am.

390
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:30,154
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

391
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:38,011
"In the end, every relationship
needs maintenance. "

392
00:19:38,012 --> 00:19:40,321
Hey, Ted. Get out the sun, man.

393
00:19:41,286 --> 00:19:42,731
You owe me money!

394
00:19:46,657 --> 00:19:48,408
"Whether it's the smallest gesture... "

395
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:49,665
Hey, Doctor. Doctor!

396
00:19:49,766 --> 00:19:52,223
Want to, uh, you wanna take
a look at the guy in 302

397
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,592
and tell me whether or not you think
he's really sick or just bonkers?

398
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,067
Are you actually asking my opinion?

399
00:19:56,068 --> 00:19:59,495
Well, I'm gonna ignore it, but...
yeah, knock yourself out.

400
00:20:01,662 --> 00:20:03,667
"Or just picking up back
where you left off. "

401
00:20:04,268 --> 00:20:06,510
I'm a little nervous
about surgery tomorrow.

402
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:07,822
Aw, you'll kick ass.

403
00:20:10,498 --> 00:20:12,208
So are you guys gonna go out tonight?

404
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:13,917
No, we're gonna stay in.

405
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,538
Well, I'll be in the bedroom
with all the straight people.

406
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:25,362
- Are your giblets warm?
- Like a Christmas ham!

407
00:20:25,363 --> 00:20:26,363
Same!

408
00:20:28,163 --> 00:20:30,302
"The bottom line is that
if you care about someone,"

409
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,497
"it's pretty easy to
make the sacrifice. "

410
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,148
Thanks, J.D.

411
00:20:38,852 --> 00:20:42,286
And she's just been graveled!
