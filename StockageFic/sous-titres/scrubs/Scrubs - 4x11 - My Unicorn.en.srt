1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,200
Life in a hospital is never boring.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,380
What the hell are you guys doing?

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,860
Practicing our slow motion run.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,370
Makes everything seem more dramatic.

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,030
You're doctors. Doctors.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,410
Baby?

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,970
Go get her, Turk!

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,000
Waaaaaaiiiiit!

9
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,850
Oh, he's slow.

10
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,620
Time to go see my favorite patient, Mr. Gregory Marks.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,160
He may need a new kidney, but he sure as hell doesn't need a new heart.

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,880
Hey, I bought you a present.

13
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,650
Oh, my God, a journal!

14
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,020
Well, you seem like the kind of sensitive young buck that likes to chronicle his feelings.

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,270
I can't wait to chronicle this one! Oh God!

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,630
I gotta tell you, Mr. Marks...

17
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,590
Even though I know you'd never take it, I'd give you one of my kidneys in a second.

18
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,220
Oh, no, I would definitely take it! I would take it with my bare hands.

19
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:08,940
Awesome.

20
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,530
Well...let me check your chart and s-see if we're a match!

21
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,540
Please don't be a match! Please don't be a match! Blood type O! Not a match! Yes!! Yes!! Yes!! Yes!!

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,710
I'm so sorry.

23
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,410
Do you have chocolate cake today?

24
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,530
Nope.

25
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,810
Oh. Isn't that just the pickle on the giant crap sandwich that is my day!

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,080
Elliot, relax; I never get chocolate cake.

27
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,620
Oh, right,'cause you're diabetic. Boo-hoo!

28
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,440
You know what, Turk, if you want sympathy, get a disease people can see!

29
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:37,980
Wow!

30
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,920
Oh my God, I am so sorry. I'm just having the worst day.

31
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,220
It's no biggie.

32
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,220
Forgive and forget, right?

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,220
Please get her.

34
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,520
I have been kicking ass lately, but this place is such a boys' club...

35
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,950
I still can't even get x-rays or lab tests back on time.

36
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,080
Hey, Elliot, if you're desperate to get things done, you could always do what Jordan does.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,380
Could you move my car out of the sun?

38
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,270
If the seat gets too hot, my thighs get all pink and sweaty.

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,300
Yeah. Bye-bye, security guard.

40
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,470
Hm. Very classy.

41
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,880
Don't judge me, stick. You do what you have to do to level the playing field.

42
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,100
Well, Carla and I would never behave that way.

43
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,300
Thank you.

44
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,570
How'd you get chocolate cake? He said they didn't have any!

45
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,070
Oh. I just did like this and said, "Got cake?"

46
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,680
This is ridiculous! You can't just get cake by going like this:

47
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:32,850
Mmm?

48
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,030
Hello, Heather.

49
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,410
You will never guess what I found on the computer!

50
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,230
Is it a set of adult male shoulders?

51
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,350
They had to trim them to get me out of that well.

52
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:44,930
Oh, right.

53
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,870
Anyway, know Mr. Marks? He said he doesn't have any family to be a kidney donor?

54
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,710
But he's got a son! We gotta find this guy!

55
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,810
Look, Newbie, there are times a man wants to keep something to himself.

56
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:57,970
Like, say, he's got a son. Or he's 29-years-old and keeps a journal with a unicorn drawn on the cover?

57
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,790
Ah, that's a horse with a sword on his head, and he's there to guard my hopes and dreams.

58
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,890
Come on, if the guy didn't tell you about his son, I'm sure he had a pretty good reason.

59
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,350
You know, you always do this... you get too involved in your patients' lives.

60
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,830
And just exactly how does that usually work out for ya?

61
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,500
Eventually someone's gonna miss me, Jerry!

62
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,420
Oh, God, no.

63
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,250
He made me watch'Everwood'.

64
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah, yeah. Look, Claudia:

65
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,900
Just promise me you won't get too involved with your patient. Okay?

66
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:34,050
After getting more involved, I found out Mr. Marks's son was an air-traffic controller at a small private airport.

67
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,890
- Come on, Brian, I don't wanna do this... 
- Relax, will you? Relax.

68
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,520
We're gonna put her on the speakerphone, if you don't like the sound of her voice, she's history.

69
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,620
I'll tell you something about'Wings' ...they really got it right.

70
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,620
Excuse me, are you Murray Marks?

71
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,600
I'm busy.

72
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,180
You don't look busy.

73
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,960
Tower, this is flight 117. We've lost an engine.

74
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,720
Yeah, you're right. I'm not busy.

75
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,910
You can take that.

76
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,180
No, no, no. Let's talk.

77
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,960
Oh, God! We've lost the other engine!

78
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,030
Take it! TAKE IT!

79
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,880
Okay. Pull up, 117. Pull up.

80
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,360
Hello?

81
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:08,970
Hello?

82
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,100
We lost'em.

83
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,850
So what was your thing?

84
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,130
Shouldn't you call the fire department or something!?!

85
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,680
Nah, nah. That was just Mickey fooling around.

86
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:20,450
Hey.

87
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,860
This is a tiny airport, we get like one airplane a day.

88
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,740
I'm a pretty airplane! Board me!

89
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,060
He's a little off.

90
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,580
He smells like fuel.

91
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,030
He's an airplane.

92
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,360
Scrubs épisode 4x07 :

94
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,820
I'm not quite sure I'm getting this.

95
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,260
What's not to get? Look, Dr. Cox told me not to get involved,

96
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,290
I defied him, and now, with your help, I'm gonna rub it in his face, okay?

97
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,640
Now for the last time, the song goes like this:

98
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,770
"You were wrong! I found his son, I found his son, I found his son!"

99
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,020
And then you jump out and go, "That's me!"

100
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,930
Yeah, but--okay, but wouldn't it be funnier if I came on the second "I found his son," just to get to it?

101
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,370
Yeah, that would be a whole lot funnier. But I have a question:

102
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,770
Who's gonna be singing the "I found his son" song? Because it certainly won't be me! Okay?

103
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:24,580
Here he comes.

104
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,230
Dr. Cox...?

105
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,830
You were wrong! I found his son, I found his son, I f...

106
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,970
That's meeee!

107
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,200
Too early?

108
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,550
We rehearsed this!

109
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,730
We were on your scooter.

110
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,470
Gah!

111
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,750
Reunion time. This is gonna be great.

112
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,850
Mm? Murray?

113
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,730
Before you say anything, I just want you to know if you need a kidney, you can have mine.

114
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,730
See?

115
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,690
For seventy thousand dollars!

116
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,280
I love this moment so much I want to have sex with it.

117
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,860
Franklyn. I was wondering if you could put a rush on Mr. Lowenstein's urinalysis?

118
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,610
Because I've got a really important interview for a fellowship next year.

119
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,130
No. We're done talking now.

120
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,970
Elliot. We can help.

121
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,510
No! No. You will not turn Elliot into some flirtatious manipulator.

122
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,850
I mean, don't get me wrong, outside the hospital, Elliot with her hair up is a slammin' hottie.

123
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,850
But in here she's an asexual mess.

124
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,470
And that's the natural order of things. And you don't mess with the natural order!

125
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,400
Elliot, don't listen to him, he doesn't know what he's talking about.

126
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,440
Look, I will try anything. I just don't want to compromise who I am. Eh?

127
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,100
Sweetie, you won't have to do that!

128
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,500
Sure, if it's something really important, you might have to occasionally sleep with someone.

129
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,820
That's how I hooked up with Perry ...needed a pen.

130
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:01,730
You won't have to compromise yourself. It's all about subtlety. It's...a lingering smile --

131
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,500
...a chuckle at a bad joke --

132
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,680
...a look in your eye that says, "If you do what I want maybe something will happen between us, even though you know it never will...."

133
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:17,140
Franklyn, if you analyze this urine sample right now, then maybe I'll have sex with you, but probably not.

134
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,490
So close.

135
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,090
All right, we--what's the problem with your dad?

136
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,790
Well, for starters, he named me "Murray." That's an old man's name!

137
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,210
Oh, come on, no it isn't!

138
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,740
MURRAY!

139
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,390
WHAT!?

140
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,810
Everything my father's ever done was designed to humiliate me.

141
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,830
Murray!

142
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,370
WHAT!?

143
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,210
What.

144
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,210
No, the youngest Murray!

145
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,560
I'm sixty-eight!

146
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,440
Thirty-four!

147
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,580
You don't know what it was like having him as a father. He had me in his shadows my whole life.

148
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:06,830
He actually sang at my senior prom. My date threw her panties on the stage ...first and last time I saw them, by the way.

149
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,010
Whenever I'm around the guy I'm invisible.

150
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,820
Oh, come on, you're exaggerating.

151
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,350
See what I mean?

152
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,800
I love this song.

153
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,470
Ooooh. Thank you!

154
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:36,730
Okay, so I tried to get some x-rays back from the lab tech by making a kissy face, and he asked me if I had palsy!

155
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:40,320
Elliot, if you want to get ahead, you have to use what God gave ya!

156
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,300
Or in your case, what Dr. Fineberg gave you.

157
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,480
Exactly!

158
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,550
I can't keep my kidney guy's son from leaving.

159
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,910
Elliot will help.

160
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,440
You can do this!

161
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,300
Hi, I'm Elliot.

162
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,980
Hi, I'm Murray.

163
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,550
Hi, I'm Elliot.

164
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,550
I'm firing blanks, here!

165
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,570
Frick! These are my favorite scrubs!

166
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,570
Is it a bad stain?

167
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,610
No. That's a good stain.

168
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,220
That's a very good stain. That's my favorite stain ever.

169
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,280
I did it!

170
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,280
She has nice breasts.

171
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,820
- They're real. 
- Yeah, right.

172
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,960
- No, they are. 
- They're not.

173
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,660
I can't believe you got cake! The guy said they didn't have any.

174
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,240
Just do what I told you to do.

175
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,250
Sweets for the sweet.

176
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,660
Thank you...Glen.

177
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,390
Look, Murray, it doesn't matter that your father's handsome and charismatic

178
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:43,520
and sings like a young Joan Baez. He's your flesh and blood, and you gotta step up.

179
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,560
Look, you obviously have some issues with your own father that you're projecting on to me.

180
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,180
So why don't you go ahead and give him a jingle?

181
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,330
He's dead.

182
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,380
Good stuff!

183
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,220
No, I'm serious.

184
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,010
Classic!

185
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,450
He had like a massive heart attack.

186
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,710
I'm sorry for your loss.

187
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,860
Now, about the kidney....

188
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,600
I wish I could fly my plane right now. I always like to fly it when I have to make a big decision.

189
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,440
Make the "flesh and blood" argument again but in a different way.

190
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,010
Blood and flesh, Murray.

191
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,380
I'll do it!

192
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,570
Jackpot!

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,410
Yawning, Glen!

194
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,680
One for the road, Glen?

195
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,250
Thanks! Happy weekend!

196
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,190
Elliot, did you talk Franklyn into doing your patient's urinalysis before mine?

197
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,010
No, I just told him I lost my voice and had to whisper in his ear...

198
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,010
like this.

199
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,860
Careful, Elliot.

200
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,970
Oh, come on, what harm could come from a little flirting?

201
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,660
Ah! I wanna see that engagement ring.

202
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,980
That costs ten thousand dollars.

203
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,580
I got twelve bucks.

204
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,480
- You okay? 
- Yeah, why?

205
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,320
You have created a monster.

206
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,670
Elliot did a little tongue dance in Franklyn's ear just to get him to do her labs before mine.

207
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,240
So she used her femininity!

208
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:13,150
The only reason you usually get your lab-work back so fast is because you always pick Franklyn to play basketball,

209
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,840
even though he always shoots his foul shots granny-style.

210
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,480
This is different.

211
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,870
Excuse me.

212
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,600
This is gonna cause problems.

213
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,240
Oh, I'll just be a sec.

214
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,570
Dave, can I get an orange soda? I'm so hot and thirsty.

215
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,540
It's on me.

216
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,190
I'd like an orange soda too.

217
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,590
Oh, I'm sorry, that was the last one. How sad.

218
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:45,060
That's the way female doctors around here behave, I hope the young lady I'm interviewing is a different breed.

219
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,920
Do either of you know where I can find Dr. Elliot Reid?

220
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,260
"I told you so" moments are rare. So when they come, you have to savor them.

221
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,440
Hey, Newbie! The good news is that Murray and his dad are a match, kidney-wise.

222
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,630
The better news is that the test revealed a little secret you're gonna wanna share with your new pal.

223
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,560
Gregory is not Murray's biological father!

224
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,810
Oh, no.

225
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,530
By the by? This moment is so great,

226
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,470
I'd cheat on that other moment from before, marry this one and raise a family of tiny little moments.

227
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,620
Dammit!

228
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,420
I couldn't decide whether I should tell Murray his dad wasn't his dad.

229
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,110
Luckily hospitals are full of supportive colleagues eager to help.

230
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:42,300
Go tell that little bastard this second, before he coughs a kidney up to his fake father and sues this hospital!

231
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,760
Write that down in your little unicorn book.

232
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,870
Uh, actually, sir, it's a horse with a sword on his head.

233
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,810
You know I'm a unicorn. Why can't you just say it?

234
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,660
What are you going to do, son?

235
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,260
Well, Dr. Kels...

236
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,370
Well, Dr. Kelso, I'm just gonna tell him. Murray's got a good heart, and he'll do the right thing.

237
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,360
I'm outta here!

238
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,460
Murray!

239
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,480
Whaaat?

240
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,330
Not you, Old Murray!

241
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,910
Okay!

242
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,400
I put interview guy in the lounge and told him that Elliot was with a patient.

243
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,860
Now. How we gonna fix this thing?

244
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,630
You're okay.

245
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,530
The guy wanted an orange soda, right?

246
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,070
We bring him an orange soda, maybe the whole thing goes away.

247
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,260
Okay, here's the plan: Jordan and I will take care of interview guy.

248
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,000
Soft-Scrub, you can do whatever the hell you want.

249
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,160
I will.

250
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,700
Dammit! I told you to sparkle!

251
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,300
He says he clears his head by flying his plane.

252
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,270
But I went to his airport? He doesn't have a plane there! What should I do?

253
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,960
Who gave you this number?

254
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,180
Come on, I'm really asking for your help here.

255
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,970
Yeah, but, it's very important we focus on the whole "who gave you this number" issue.

256
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,630
Fine! Maybe I got too involved like you said.

257
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,230
But would it kill you for once to acknowledge that my heart is in the right place instead of spending all your time berating me?

258
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,410
You got the number from Jordan, didn't you.

259
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,630
She hates me.

260
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,310
You've been great as usual.

261
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:24,830
Dammit, Murray! What corner of the sky are you and your plane hiding in!?

262
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,320
There you are! Hi, buddy!

263
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,840
Hey...!

264
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,440
Ohh, ohh! I'm a doctor! I'm a doctor! Everything can't get to me!

265
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,130
What an odd sized explosion.

266
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,950
Elliot, your interviewer called, he's running late. Would you take Turk somewhere for me?

267
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,860
Where?

268
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,060
Oh. The, uh, honey festival!

269
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh my God! Is that back in town?

270
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,410
Sure is! And Turk would love to go with you.

271
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,810
You would?

272
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,430
Yes. I love large groups of white people eating pollen.

273
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,610
On behalf of the honey festival, I would like to thank our two volunteers: Our taster, Elliot...

274
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:58,110
And of course, Christopher, the human honeycomb.

275
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,610
I thought you meant the cereal!

276
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,070
Can I talk to you for a second?

277
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,610
Tower, are you there? I lost an engine!

278
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,180
I'm not falling for that crap again!

279
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,800
This is real! Mickey's not here.

280
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,170
Oh, God! I lost another engine!

281
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,350
Calm down, Frank. You left your engines in the storage shed.

282
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,780
Oh, there they are! Thanks, Murray.

283
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,020
It's what I do.

284
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,060
Anyhoo, what do you think your dad is doing right now?

285
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,930
He's not my dad, he's my fake dad.

286
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:38,980
Which means what my fake cousin Samantha and I almost did in the tenth grade would have been beautiful...and right.

287
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,230
Been there with my gram-gram....

288
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,310
All right, fine, what do you think Gregory's doing right now?

289
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,760
Probably playing his stupid guitar.

290
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,450
Ah, so maybe I wasn't the perfect dad.

291
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,810
I mean, there were the occasional missed baseball games....

292
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:03,420
And the taking of his college sweetheart to the Bahamas for two weeks without telling him....

293
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,630
But I still don't see why he resents me this much.

294
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,820
Boy, tell me about it.

295
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:20,030
You know, I got this kid who constantly ignores my advice, and then flashes me the sad doe eyes every time I call him a girl's name or scream in his face.

296
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,810
Do you wanna sing about him?

297
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,810
No. Not ever.

298
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,790
Sometimes Dr. Cox is all over me, like every second of my life.

299
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,440
Why do you keep talking about your boss like he's your father?

300
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,650
Remember? Recently deceased dad?

301
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,920
Massive heart attack!

302
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,700
Yes! I mean, yes.

303
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,520
You do know he's not yours, don'cha.

304
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,080
I figured it out.

305
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:54,020
Mostly because his mother was eight months pregnant when I met her. But there were other signs.

306
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,400
'Course.

307
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,580
But his real dad was such a jerk we just decided not to tell him.

308
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,740
A boy needs a father who loves him, you know?

309
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,740
Yeah.

310
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,800
Elliot! What are you doing here?

311
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,980
My interviewer called my cell phone. He has been waiting to talk to me!

312
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,830
What the hell?

313
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,420
Woman, I was covered in bees!

314
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,960
Elliot, wait!

315
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,450
Elliot, you did your flirty manipulation thing in front of that guy in there, and now,

316
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,990
well, he kinda thinks you're this despicable floozy ho excuse for a doctor.

317
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,450
Oh. Um...well, then I will just explain it to him. It'll be fine.

318
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:44,350
Wait! Sir, just hear me out! It...UGH!

319
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,380
Ladies. I think we've learned our lesson.

320
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,480
That is not helpful, Turkleton!

321
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,000
I was covered in bees!

322
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,560
Oh my God, he's actually giving him an orange soda.

323
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,640
What happened?

324
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,200
He's gonna reconsider you.

325
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,700
How'd you do that?

326
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,670
Hey, buddy. I need you to reconsider Blonde Doctor.

327
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,240
And I'm gonna tell you why. See, I'm the future Mr. Blonde Doctor?

328
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,690
And I kinda need this to happen so that I can, uh... hey, over here...

329
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,310
I need this to happen so that I can just hang out around the house and, you know, bake bread or...

330
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,730
gab across the fence with neighbor Marge. Nice lady. Polish, I think.

331
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,150
Doesn't matter, I'm not prejudice.

332
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,600
What the hell are you talking about?

333
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:34,030
Here's the thing: I need you to take this can of orange soda, turn, smile,

334
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,870
and give Blonde Doctor a big thumb's up!

335
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,950
Or, I'm gonna take the same orange soda,

336
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,380
follow you down to the parking lot, and smash your head in with it.

337
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,250
We...talked about your future.

338
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,120
I don't know if I can go through with this.

339
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,520
I wish there was something to help me get through the door.

340
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,500
Hey, jerk-hole.

341
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,260
Yeah?

342
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,530
No, new jerk-hole!

343
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,450
Now, no matter what you think of that guy in there, he always knew he wasn't your father but he stayed in the game anyway.

344
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,370
So how's about you get your selfish ass in there.

345
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,210
Okay.

346
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,300
Hey.

347
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:18,680
Hey.

348
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,470
So, I got this extra kidney I'm not using.

349
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,510
Are you sure?

350
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,140
Yeah.

351
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,960
You know I love you, right?

352
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,600
Yeah, I know you do.

353
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,090
I love you too, dad.

354
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,910
Dad.

355
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,510
Dad. Dad!

356
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,200
In a hospital, it's easy to take things too far.

357
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,290
Still, sometimes you have to go too far to see where the line is.

358
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,940
Please, Franklyn?

359
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,750
Oh, okay. Come with me, little friend.

360
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,950
As for me...

361
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,640
...Maybe I got too involved with Murray and his fake real dad.

362
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:18,120
But as I watched Gregory serenade a clearly uncomfortable Murray, I realized something.

363
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:25,680
If Murray could look past his dad's imperfections and appreciate all the time he'd given him,

364
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,340
maybe I owe Dr. Cox a thank-you for the same thing.

365
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,870
Hey. I just wanted to take a second to thank you for constantly berating me,

366
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,690
doubting my abilities, and the overall devastation of my self-esteem.

367
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,260
My pleasure.

368
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,060
Now wrap it all up with a slow motion hand wave.

369
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,430
Oh, I'm slooooow, baby.

9999
