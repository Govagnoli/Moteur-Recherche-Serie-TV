1
00:00:02,548 --> 00:00:04,644
Hospitals are hectic. But there's
a certain time every morning,

2
00:00:04,645 --> 00:00:07,861
after the bedpans have been emptied,
that a calm washes over the place;

3
00:00:08,586 --> 00:00:09,950
and you can't help but feel peaceful.

4
00:00:09,951 --> 00:00:15,080
Holy Vishnu! Look, we've been working
together a while, could you not whistle at me?

5
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:17,731
You're right, Newbie, we have
been working together for a while.

6
00:00:17,732 --> 00:00:20,615
Of course, I wouldn't know the exact
number of days unless I consulted

7
00:00:20,616 --> 00:00:24,453
my Friends For Life calendar that I
keep taped inside my hope chest. Still...

8
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:26,467
I've learned to make Dr.
Cox's rants work for me.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,975
I catch up on paperwork;
I look after patients...

10
00:00:28,976 --> 00:00:31,219
Carla, can you check room
air pulse ox on Mrs. Shipp?

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,194
You got it, Bambi.

12
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:34,796
...I take care of those official
things that just have to get done.

13
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:35,970
You're a jerk.

14
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:36,741
You're a jerk!

15
00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:40,734
...Long story short, there,
Molly, I will always whistle at you

16
00:00:40,735 --> 00:00:45,312
like you're a blonde with big bombs and I'm a
construction worker just released from prison.

17
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:46,812
That clear?

18
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:47,458
Crystal!

19
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:47,949
Super!

20
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,636
Uh, listen, while I have you here
-- I'm applying for a fellowship,

21
00:00:50,637 --> 00:00:53,850
and I could really use a letter of
recommendation. I was thinking that,

22
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:56,856
when you wrote it, instead of using a girl's
name you could refer to me as "Dr. Dorian."

23
00:00:56,857 --> 00:01:00,792
I think it sounds a little more professional
and, frankly, each time you call me a girl's name,

24
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:02,250
I die a little inside.

25
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:08,391
Look, Janice, Denise, Tiffany
Amber Thiiiieeeessen! Lemme go ahead

26
00:01:08,392 --> 00:01:11,535
and share a little something special with
you that I like to call Perry's Perspective.

27
00:01:11,536 --> 00:01:14,905
One: If someone's standing in front
of me in line at the coffee shop and

28
00:01:14,906 --> 00:01:17,341
they can't decide what they want in the
half an hour it took to get to the register,

29
00:01:17,342 --> 00:01:21,965
I should be allowed to kill them. Two: I'm
fairly sure if they took porn off the internet,

30
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:25,610
there'd only be one website left, and
it'd be called "Bring back the porn!"

31
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:29,560
Three and most importantly of all: The
only way to be respected as a doctor

32
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:35,045
nay, respected as a man -- is to be an island;
you are born alone, you damn sure die alone.

33
00:01:35,046 --> 00:01:36,712
Isn't that right, spike?

34
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:41,332
The point is, and you just might want to
jot this down: only the weak need help.

35
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:43,768
I should get that tattooed on my neck.

36
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,562
Good afternoon, Sacred Heart!

37
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,911
Hey! Your Chief of Medicine
just said good afternoon, people!

38
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,412
Dr. Jeffrey Steadman,
world-class suck-up.

39
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:57,755
Especially since the residency
director position opened up.

40
00:01:57,756 --> 00:01:59,780
Dr. Cox, you know Dr. Steadman.

41
00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:03,186
You're a doctor? Here,
all this time I had thought

42
00:02:03,187 --> 00:02:06,975
that you were some kind of parasitic creature
who lived shoulder-deep inside Big Bob's colon.

43
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:09,783
If only, sir.

44
00:02:09,784 --> 00:02:12,069
Well, I'm off to fluid rounds.

45
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,153
To fluid rounds!

46
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:19,318
Mm! In the new Sea World
dolphin show, Sean opens

47
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,940
with this impression of a blowfish that
will totally crack you guys up! Show them.

48
00:02:27,656 --> 00:02:29,531
What the hell, that's not
funny! All he did was this

49
00:02:32,272 --> 00:02:32,976
Hey, you're not doing it right.

50
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:36,745
It's never fun being the fifth wheel,
especially when one of those wheels

51
00:02:36,746 --> 00:02:40,245
is Elliot's boyfriend. Still, I
had decided to take the high road.

52
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:43,735
Hey, J.D., is this regular? I
asked you to bring me a diet.

53
00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:45,639
That is diet....

54
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,890
I don't understand! I'm so careful about
what I eat, I'm just keep putting on weight!

55
00:02:50,891 --> 00:02:53,057
It's all the regular soda, Sean!

56
00:02:59,082 --> 00:03:00,438
Enjoy.

57
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:04,538
Muahahahahahahaha!

58
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:05,589
All right, that's enough.

59
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:10,624
Scrubs 3x05 - My lucky night

60
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,211
Transcript : Michelle V.L. M.
Synchro : foromuser10 pour www.forom.com

61
00:03:21,518 --> 00:03:24,398
So, I'm leaving the day after tomorrow,
to work on this project studying

62
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:27,620
the fishing industry's impact on Maui
dolphins.They're an endangered species;

63
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:30,143
if something isn't done soon they could
actually be wiped off the face of the earth.

64
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:34,709
Fascinating stuff, Sean.

65
00:03:35,991 --> 00:03:37,204
Oh, hey -- I used
to date that girl.

66
00:03:40,023 --> 00:03:40,893
Hello, boys.

67
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:45,347
Hi, I'm Elliot.
So, you guys used to date?

68
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:47,447
Nice to see you, Sean.

69
00:03:48,345 --> 00:03:51,863
You, too, Mary...Angel...izabeth...?

70
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,665
Goodbye, boys....

71
00:03:57,092 --> 00:03:58,805
You know, it's always awkward
when you run into an ex, isn't it?

72
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:01,060
Tell me about it. I don't
know how J.D. and Elliot do it.

73
00:04:01,946 --> 00:04:02,449
Do what?

74
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,736
Oh, no! I've got to stop this! Kick him!

75
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:07,454
Oh!

76
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,083
You okay, baby?

77
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:08,787
Yeah....

78
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:10,416
How they have sex every year and
still manage to stay friends....

79
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:14,346
We haven't actually had a chance to
talk about that yet. But thank you.

80
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,543
Hey. C'mere a sec -- we
wanna do stuff to you.

81
00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:23,885
Crap. The Janitor. And
he's with Sloppy Joe Guy!

82
00:04:23,886 --> 00:04:26,749
Okay, just distract them before
they do whatever they've got planned!

83
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:28,059
We were thinkin'....

84
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,290
I've got a riddle for you!

85
00:04:30,493 --> 00:04:31,507
This isn't how you said it would go.

86
00:04:31,508 --> 00:04:34,239
Troy! We're listening.

87
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,440
Two coins add up to thirty cents
and one of them is not a nickel.

88
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:38,655
So what are they?

89
00:04:38,656 --> 00:04:40,956
It's a riddle. You figure it out.

90
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,840
Troy, get your hat.
We're going to the bank.

91
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,185
Post-op diagnosis: acute cholecystitis.

92
00:04:57,186 --> 00:05:00,847
Estimated blood loss: a
hundred and fifty CCs and...

93
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:12,813
"I don't know much / but I know I love you
ooh ooh ooh / And that may be all I need to"--

94
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:15,415
place a transfer to recovery
room awake and stable.

95
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,844
Hey, baby!

96
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:20,460
Notice anything different?

97
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:22,346
Your tongue went counter-clockwise!

98
00:05:22,347 --> 00:05:23,062
No!

99
00:05:23,063 --> 00:05:25,047
Green scrubs!

100
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:27,240
I'm covering for one
of the surgical nurses.

101
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:30,221
We could use the extra cash,
plus we get to work side-by-side

102
00:05:30,222 --> 00:05:33,246
for the next two whole
days. Isn't that great!

103
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:34,808
So great!

104
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:35,773
Right?

105
00:05:35,774 --> 00:05:36,274
So...

106
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:41,419
So, J.D. and I slept together.
It's not that big a deal.

107
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:44,204
You know Betty from work --
I see her every day, right?

108
00:05:44,205 --> 00:05:45,854
How would you feel if I
told you we slept together?

109
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,569
Well, I'd be disturbed, Sean,
because Betty is a harp seal.

110
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,717
Yeah, but a harp seal who's
smart, funny, and totally gets me!

111
00:05:52,908 --> 00:05:54,663
Oh, my God! Is anyone in
more hell than me right now?

112
00:05:56,743 --> 00:05:59,691
Dude. We're goin' to the caf. so I
can tell all the boys about my date

113
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,906
with Strangely
Attractive Intern! You in?

114
00:06:02,907 --> 00:06:06,101
I think that Turk is a
little more mature than that.

115
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:07,609
She's right.

116
00:06:08,723 --> 00:06:10,474
But still, honey, what I think
you're missing here is that,

117
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:13,361
not only is she attractive,
but she's strangely attractive.

118
00:06:15,302 --> 00:06:16,208
Guys, I can't go!

119
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:21,521
"I'll miss you" high-five!

120
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:29,650
I know, isn't that a coincidence!
Well, thank you for coming by!

121
00:06:29,651 --> 00:06:31,986
I'm sure we're gonna be in
touch with you real soon.

122
00:06:31,987 --> 00:06:37,835
Our nanny just walked out the door. Gimme a break,
she's experienced, she has great credentials....

123
00:06:37,836 --> 00:06:40,769
Oh, no, no, she's got great,
huge, perky credentials.

124
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,998
She's out. Besides, she's too expensive.

125
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:48,272
About that, now, I've actually been thinking
about going after that residency director job.

126
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:49,797
Residency director?

127
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:51,267
Yeah-heah!

128
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:54,606
But Perry, you realize if you did that, you
would be taking a positive step in your life.

129
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:56,459
I know.

130
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,344
First place we made love?

131
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:00,882
Oh, gimme a break. We've
never..."made love".

132
00:07:00,883 --> 00:07:04,079
Whew, it is you. I'm
so proud I could poo.

133
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,404
Seriously, though, it's great! And it's
a board decision, so I can help you out!

134
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:09,600
No, no!

135
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:10,125
Yes!

136
00:07:10,126 --> 00:07:12,345
No! I'm serious, Jordan,
I don't believe in it.

137
00:07:12,346 --> 00:07:16,723
I'd make you swear on a Bible, but I know how
contact with holy stuff makes your skin sizzle.

138
00:07:16,724 --> 00:07:18,263
So just...promise me?

139
00:07:18,264 --> 00:07:19,964
Oh, fine. No help.

140
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:20,786
Great.

141
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,548
Holy cow!

142
00:07:24,549 --> 00:07:25,765
You're hired.

143
00:07:31,044 --> 00:07:32,442
I cannot believe you're
still angry about this.

144
00:07:32,443 --> 00:07:33,790
I'm not angry.

145
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:37,515
DIE! DIE, DIE, DIE!
ROT IN HELL!

146
00:07:40,936 --> 00:07:41,425
I got it.

147
00:07:42,251 --> 00:07:45,168
Okay, yes! J.D. and I work together!
But it's not like we're crazy close!

148
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:49,029
I mean, it's not like we have all these inside
jokes! And we definitely don't do this....

149
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:01,569
Good evening, Elliot! This is your
great aunt Sally. Are you there?

150
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,638
I have to get that.

151
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,843
I guess you're at Sean's. Hey,
good thing we're so crazy close,

152
00:08:05,844 --> 00:08:07,754
or I wouldn't know how to
impersonate your aunt Sally!

153
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:11,421
By the way, I ran into Eye Patch this
morning -- said to tell you, "Honka! Honka!"

154
00:08:15,054 --> 00:08:18,715
It's just an inside...joke.

155
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:28,992
Doctors!

156
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:34,292
Okay, come on: Two coins.
Thirty cents. No nickels.

157
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,496
Come on! You can do this! You
went to Harvard, for God's sake!

158
00:08:38,497 --> 00:08:40,840
Relax! I figured it out.

159
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,465
Okay.... You gave me a
penny...and...what appears to be a button,

160
00:08:47,466 --> 00:08:50,320
on which you've written
twenty-nine cents.

161
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:53,820
Can't we just kill him?

162
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,984
No, no, no... That's
what he wants us to do.

163
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:06,915
Just a real nice
helmet, there, princess.

164
00:09:07,555 --> 00:09:09,285
Actually, it's not a
helmet, it's a Hairmet

165
00:09:09,286 --> 00:09:12,013
it has extra room so you
don't mess up your hairdo.

166
00:09:13,671 --> 00:09:15,665
Fair enough. I'm gonna go ahead
and write you a prescription

167
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:19,387
for two testicles; and you feel free
to get this filled out whenever you want

168
00:09:19,388 --> 00:09:22,376
but right now, I'm goin' after
that residency director gig,

169
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:25,971
and you're joining me for a really
stupid board member meet-and-greet.

170
00:09:25,972 --> 00:09:27,154
Will you write my recommendation?

171
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:27,879
Oh, hell no!

172
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,530
Goodbye.

173
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:30,947
Oh, gimme a break! I'll write
whatever you want! Just...we gotta go.

174
00:09:30,948 --> 00:09:33,744
Okay, fine. Lemme just
fix my hair. Oh, wait!

175
00:09:35,782 --> 00:09:36,674
I don't have to!

176
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:38,800
Oh, good God!

177
00:09:46,047 --> 00:09:46,496
Scalpel.

178
00:09:47,205 --> 00:09:47,634
Scalpel what?

179
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:49,475
Scalpel, please.

180
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:53,349
Here you go, baby. Sorry: Dr. Baby.

181
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:56,181
Shall we proceed, Dr. Baby?

182
00:09:57,294 --> 00:09:59,190
You know, Buppy, this guy
looks a lot like your waxer!

183
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,453
The Todd says, What now?

184
00:10:02,462 --> 00:10:06,008
Nothing! She meant her waxer,
'cause we're...We're working, guys.

185
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:07,753
No, no, no. I wanna hear this.

186
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:12,262
It's no big deal. I make Turk wax his
chest so he doesn't give me a rash.

187
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:16,744
Oh, okay. Does she also
make you wax your vagina?

188
00:10:19,282 --> 00:10:20,240
Sterile high-five!

189
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:23,728
Are you even gonna talk to me?

190
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:29,331
I'm sorry, okay? I didn't
tell you that I slept with J.D.

191
00:10:29,332 --> 00:10:31,718
and that was a mistake. And,
yes, we do talk all the time

192
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:34,708
and have all these inside jokes,
and he met my great aunt Sally

193
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:37,730
when she came to the hospital with my
demented great uncle who wears an eye patch

194
00:10:37,731 --> 00:10:39,172
and goes "honka! honka!" when he poops.

195
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,380
And now you hate me.

196
00:10:45,285 --> 00:10:48,776
Elliot, I don't hate you. Okay?
I'm not even that mad at you.

197
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:50,772
You're not?

198
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:55,580
No. How do I explain this...

199
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,397
You know when you have really
bad news to give to someone?

200
00:10:58,397 --> 00:11:01,913
So you try to make them
look like the bad guy

201
00:11:01,914 --> 00:11:04,182
by taking a small thing and
blowing it way out of proportion?

202
00:11:04,183 --> 00:11:08,380
Totally. So glad that
has nothing to do with us!

203
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,839
Elliot, the trip that
I'm leaving on tomorrow...

204
00:11:14,737 --> 00:11:15,878
it's actually a lot
longer than I let on.

205
00:11:16,586 --> 00:11:17,448
What, like three days?

206
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:19,463
No....

207
00:11:20,085 --> 00:11:20,359
Four days?

208
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:22,485
Six months.

209
00:11:23,744 --> 00:11:24,409
Five days?

210
00:11:32,034 --> 00:11:32,845
Love your Hairmet.

211
00:11:34,012 --> 00:11:34,613
Love yours!

212
00:11:35,764 --> 00:11:38,042
It was amazing to see how much
Dr. Cox actually wanted this job.

213
00:11:38,043 --> 00:11:40,538
And how much he was willing
to put up with to get it!

214
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:44,470
So, the wife and I ended up
buying Egyptian cotton bed sheets!

215
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:47,844
Gee, you're too much. What's the
thread count on those bad boys?

216
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:50,300
I guess it was just amazing
to see how much he cared.

217
00:11:54,892 --> 00:11:55,813
Gotta go.

218
00:11:55,814 --> 00:12:01,293
Well, well, well.... Snip my
pickle and call me schlo-mo!

219
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:04,825
You're not actually applying
for residency director.

220
00:12:05,562 --> 00:12:07,339
Oh, I don't know, Bob. Here, I
like to think I've accomplished

221
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,995
plenty of things much more difficult
than this. Why, just yesterday morning

222
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:14,875
I somehow managed to hack into your
voice-mail and change the outgoing message to,

223
00:12:14,876 --> 00:12:19,169
"Hi, this is Big Bob. Why, I'm
not in right now but, at the beep,

224
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,603
leave your name and your penis size!"

225
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:26,711
Perry, have you ever wondered why
you've never risen above clinical staff

226
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:32,543
at this hospital? I mean, come on, pal,
who do you think the board listens to

227
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:36,519
concerning promotions around here?
Why don't I tell you after the beep?

228
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,952
Beeeeeeep.

229
00:12:37,953 --> 00:12:40,486
Bob Kelso. Ten inches.

230
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:43,721
It's like a baguette!

231
00:12:51,996 --> 00:12:52,419
Hi!

232
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:52,850
Hey.

233
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:58,268
I can't tell you how awesome it was just
getting to be with you today and watch you work.

234
00:12:58,269 --> 00:12:59,575
I know, right!

235
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:00,224
Yeah!

236
00:13:00,225 --> 00:13:05,353
But you know what? Schmitty heard that
Nurse Green's been dying to cover surgery,

237
00:13:05,354 --> 00:13:07,497
and I said you wouldn't mind
if she took your place tomorrow.

238
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:10,620
Because, between me and you, Schmitty's
been trying to hit that for like a minute,

239
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:12,905
and I had to hook him
up! You understand, right?

240
00:13:14,219 --> 00:13:18,575
Sure. I'm...I'm glad we
could help Schmitty hit that!

241
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:19,754
Yeah.

242
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:25,883
Relationships can be tricky. Especially
the ones that have barely begun.

243
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:30,569
Look, Elliot, I'm crazy about you, but I've
been going over this in my head all week.

244
00:13:31,654 --> 00:13:34,540
I've been in a long-distance relationship
before, and it was a disaster.

245
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:38,140
I've reached the point where I honestly
believe a couple has a better chance

246
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:40,140
if they just cut the cord and
know that if it's meant to be,

247
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:43,924
fate will bring them
back together. You know?

248
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,761
Yeah.... Totally....

249
00:13:58,763 --> 00:14:01,599
It's typical. Elliot's in a relationship,
so I can't stop thinking about her.

250
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,301
I just have to accept it and move on.

251
00:14:04,396 --> 00:14:06,453
So I guess...
I guess this is goodbye.

252
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:07,573
Good what?

253
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:17,969
Look, this doesn't have to be
some huge sad thing, you know?

254
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,467
It's okay. They didn't see you.

255
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:23,076
What the...?

256
00:14:23,077 --> 00:14:26,587
I know. It's just hard for me.

257
00:14:37,178 --> 00:14:40,924
I'm gonna scrubs my hands and do the
"scrub my hands" dance! Scrub my--

258
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:44,890
Christopher. I know it's a complicated
procedure, but this afternoon

259
00:14:44,891 --> 00:14:47,546
I want you to assist
me on a gastric bypass.

260
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,342
Gastric bypass?

261
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:51,383
I'm goin' to the show?

262
00:14:51,384 --> 00:14:55,012
Well, you've earned it -- you really
turned it up a notch in surgery yesterday.

263
00:14:56,183 --> 00:14:59,389
I don't know if you had a lucky charm in that
room, or what, but something was different.

264
00:15:10,184 --> 00:15:15,123
Hey! Hey, Baby! What's up?
You know, I've been thinking:

265
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:17,402
that was a lot of fun working together.

266
00:15:19,957 --> 00:15:21,249
And how long you been
thinking about that?

267
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,479
Ever since Dr. Wen offered me a gastric
bypass because I was so amazing yesterday,

268
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,159
and I realized you're the reason why.

269
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:28,927
Really?

270
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,732
Yeah! Yeah. It's just like in high
school -- I had this girlfriend

271
00:15:31,733 --> 00:15:34,999
who annoyed the crap out of me, but every
time she came to one of my basketball games,

272
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,753
I played like crazy out of my mind because
all of a sudden I was playing for her.

273
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:42,453
I wanted to make her proud.
You understand what I'm saying?

274
00:15:42,454 --> 00:15:46,385
You're saying I'm so annoying you can't
stand working with me for even two days,

275
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:49,078
but now that you have something
to gain, you want me back.

276
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,560
Exactly. Thank you!

277
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:52,241
I didn't hear an apology
anywhere in there!

278
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,060
All I heard was nonsense.

279
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:57,892
The truth is, you never asked me
how I felt about us working together.

280
00:15:57,893 --> 00:16:02,536
Plus, you embarrassed me in front
of my co-workers. You were a pain.

281
00:16:02,537 --> 00:16:06,743
You know what? Maybe I was a pain,
but do you know how many times

282
00:16:06,744 --> 00:16:10,213
you're a pain and I just let it go?
Like when we're at home and you follow me

283
00:16:10,214 --> 00:16:12,404
from room to room, even
when I go to the bathroom!

284
00:16:13,345 --> 00:16:13,920
I like to be with you.

285
00:16:13,921 --> 00:16:15,251
Pain!

286
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:19,194
Or how you've decided that me making
eye contact with you is my way of saying,

287
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:20,378
"Please, grab my breasts."

288
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,288
Don't.

289
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:24,423
Or that Aaron Neville impression
you've been working on?

290
00:16:24,424 --> 00:16:26,647
I don't do an Aaron Neville impre...

291
00:16:26,648 --> 00:16:27,208
Laverne!

292
00:16:33,902 --> 00:16:36,134
But the biggest pain of all
is that you know I'd go into

293
00:16:36,135 --> 00:16:38,355
that operating room with
you if you just apologized;

294
00:16:38,356 --> 00:16:40,509
but you're too stubborn
to do that, aren't you.

295
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,605
I am now!

296
00:16:43,777 --> 00:16:46,740
Tell me this, there, pippy:
Are you allergic to bee stings?

297
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:47,846
I don't know. Why?

298
00:16:47,847 --> 00:16:52,881
Oh, it's just that it looks so painful
and possibly infected that I must flick it!

299
00:16:52,882 --> 00:16:55,441
You know what? Okay? This
never would have happened

300
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:57,514
if my Hairmet hadn't gotten stolen at
your stupid suck-up fest last night!

301
00:16:59,223 --> 00:17:02,157
Now, I took the liberty of writing
the recommendation you promised me.

302
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,717
All you have to do is sign
right below where it says,

303
00:17:04,718 --> 00:17:07,659
"He makes me proud to be a doctor,"
and right above where it says,

304
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,667
"P.S. He ain't too hard
on the eyes, either!"

305
00:17:09,668 --> 00:17:12,985
Tell you what, Newbie: This must
be a very...very proud day for ya.

306
00:17:14,144 --> 00:17:15,286
You can't make me feel
guilty for asking for help.

307
00:17:16,657 --> 00:17:18,639
That's just the way the world
works, okay? And you know what?

308
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,207
Most people actually like helping
out the people around them.

309
00:17:23,111 --> 00:17:25,881
Take Carla, for instance! Don't you
think she'd do anything in the world

310
00:17:25,882 --> 00:17:27,511
to help out Turk, no
matter what the situation?

311
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:30,788
Look! He didn't apologize! So
just back the hell off, okay!

312
00:17:31,018 --> 00:17:33,581
He messes up and I'm the one who gets...

313
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:36,446
Still, I don't even believe that you
think asking for help makes you look weak.

314
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:39,017
I think you don't do it because you're
afraid of putting yourself out there.

315
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:40,936
And that's why you're
never gonna get anywhere.

316
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:46,365
Thank you for this!

317
00:17:56,926 --> 00:17:59,380
Laverne, did you ever notice that in
hospitals, even though you're surrounded

318
00:17:59,381 --> 00:18:02,949
by like hundreds of people, it's still
so easy to get lost in your own thoughts?

319
00:18:04,142 --> 00:18:05,198
Have you been drinkin'?

320
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,378
What's wrong with me? Here I am trying
not to let fear ruin my life anymore,

321
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:14,129
and then Sean moves away and I don't
even have the guts to tell him how I feel.

322
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,263
how I feel. I mean, life's too
short not to go for it with Elliot.

323
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,254
Plus, now Sean's out of the
picture? Stop being such a chicken!

324
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:23,497
such a chicken! I know it's
a complicated procedure,

325
00:18:23,498 --> 00:18:26,362
but I can do it without Carla
there! What am I so scared of?

326
00:18:26,363 --> 00:18:29,419
what am I so scared of? That I might actually
get this job, and have no one to blame it

327
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,635
on if I fail? Good Lord, I'm
pathetic! When was the last time...

328
00:18:32,636 --> 00:18:36,326
when was the last time he ever apologized
for anything? I wanna help him, I do,

329
00:18:36,327 --> 00:18:38,884
but in a lot of ways I guess
I'm as stubborn as he is.

330
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,634
I wish I could make some sense out of...

331
00:18:40,635 --> 00:18:43,071
I wish I could make some sense out
of this. Thirty cents, to be exact.

332
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:45,728
Damn riddle! Easy,
Janitor; you'll get this.

333
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:52,233
Sean! Sean!

334
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,206
Sorry!

335
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:05,645
No problem, little lady! I've never
left a soul behind! Got your ticket?

336
00:19:06,615 --> 00:19:07,468
No. No, I just

337
00:19:09,118 --> 00:19:10,283
I just have to talk about

338
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:15,033
Hello.

339
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:15,626
Elliot?

340
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:20,940
Sean! Sean! Okay.... Look, I know
you hate long-distance relationships,

341
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:24,692
but six months is nothing! I mean, it'll be
hard and we'd be going a long time without sex,

342
00:19:24,693 --> 00:19:28,497
but I can totally go that long
without sex! Sean, I am a sex camel!

343
00:19:30,072 --> 00:19:32,927
Look, the point is I'm not ready
for this relationship to end;

344
00:19:32,928 --> 00:19:37,490
so, even if you break my heart right
now, it's okay, because I'd regret it more

345
00:19:37,491 --> 00:19:41,399
if I didn't take this
shot. So, what do you say?

346
00:20:02,523 --> 00:20:04,305
Hey. We solved your dumb game.

347
00:20:05,766 --> 00:20:06,867
We been to the libary!

348
00:20:06,868 --> 00:20:09,878
"-brary," Troy. "Li-BRAR-y."

349
00:20:10,915 --> 00:20:13,443
Anyway, "What two coins, when you put 'em together,

350
00:20:13,444 --> 00:20:14,888
makes thirty cents and one
of them isn't a nickel?"

351
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:25,697
A penny and...a 1972 dime with a Roosevelt
imperfection, today worth exactly twenty-nine cents.

352
00:20:27,631 --> 00:20:31,494
Nope, nope, nope. The correct
answer is: A quarter and a nickel.

353
00:20:31,495 --> 00:20:34,174
No. Because you said
one of 'em isn't a nickel.

354
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:36,187
Right. The other one is.

355
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:38,977
You lied to me.

356
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:41,492
No. It's a riddle.

357
00:20:45,234 --> 00:20:48,363
Ooh! Your face is red!
Like a strawbrerry!

358
00:20:49,918 --> 00:20:50,694
Pride's a funny thing...

359
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:52,949
Don't have kids.

360
00:20:57,725 --> 00:21:02,824
So, shall we all just agree that Dr. Steadman is our
new residency director and get the hell out of here?

361
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:06,548
If anyone wants to stop by my condo
to celebrate, my husband made sangria!

362
00:21:09,462 --> 00:21:13,047
Howdy, fellas. don't ya dare get up,
I don't want to see any broken hips.

363
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,921
A lot of times, pride can
be pretty hard to swallow.

364
00:21:18,317 --> 00:21:19,142
Would you please help me?

365
00:21:21,991 --> 00:21:25,992
So! I think we should make
Perry residency director.

366
00:21:30,632 --> 00:21:34,451
You honestly think the board would
pick him because you had his love-baby?

367
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:39,116
Oh, I don't know.... Of course,
if they don't, I'm gonna bitch

368
00:21:39,117 --> 00:21:41,332
and moan about it until
these nice gentlemen are dead.

369
00:21:42,229 --> 00:21:43,396
All those in favor of Dr. Cox?

370
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:51,512
So I guess this pretty much
makes me your bitch now.

371
00:21:51,513 --> 00:21:53,355
Oh, Perry, you always were.

372
00:21:53,356 --> 00:21:54,821
Oh, golly, God!

373
00:21:57,521 --> 00:22:00,778
But still, in a good relationship,
pride never gets in the way.

374
00:22:01,644 --> 00:22:03,307
Christopher, you okay?
You look a little nervous.

375
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:05,621
He'll be fine.

376
00:22:06,548 --> 00:22:08,923
Carla! Look, I...

377
00:22:08,924 --> 00:22:09,882
You can tell me later.

378
00:22:09,883 --> 00:22:13,851
Ohh...M'kay. Let's do this! Scalpel!

379
00:22:14,752 --> 00:22:15,366
Scalpel what?

380
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:20,932
As for me, even if I wanted to put my
pride on the line and go tell Elliot

381
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:23,875
how I feel, I can't --
I have to work tonight.

382
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:27,799
Say, Newbie, seeing as you are
partially responsible for me being

383
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,518
the new residency director, I'm gonna go
ahead and give you the rest of the night off.

384
00:22:32,486 --> 00:22:36,001
I don't know, it's just kind of
my own personal way of saying...

385
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:41,309
I can't actually stand
the sight of you. Ha!

386
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:44,258
I still don't think I should go see her.

387
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:50,137
Doctors Leeve and Winnerback, please
report to the E.R. Leeve and Winnerback.

388
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,459
Here, buddy. Baby wasn't mine.

389
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,460
What the hell...?

390
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:13,739
It's a riddle! Two guys destroyed
your bike with a crowbar and a bat.

391
00:23:14,753 --> 00:23:15,580
One of 'em wasn't me!

392
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:11,612
Oh, J.D.!

393
00:24:12,474 --> 00:24:13,548
Elliot, there's something
I have to tell you.

394
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:15,039
Hey, buddy!

395
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,636
Sean's taking a later
flight to Sea World because he decided

396
00:24:18,637 --> 00:24:20,779
to make this long-distance thing work!

397
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:24,429
I'm so happy, I can't stop crying!

398
00:24:25,994 --> 00:24:26,604
Oh, those are nice!

399
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:33,479
Ohh, these? I thought Elliot would be sad
with you guys splitting up, so I just wanted to....

400
00:24:35,288 --> 00:24:38,832
Oh, that's so sweet! You can
just put them next to Sean's.

401
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:40,180
Yeah.

402
00:24:45,177 --> 00:24:46,034
Okay.... I'm not sure they....

403
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:52,554
You okay?

404
00:24:52,555 --> 00:24:53,285
Yeah...

405
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:58,573
Not sure they can...reach
the water, but...

406
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:04,344
J.D.?
