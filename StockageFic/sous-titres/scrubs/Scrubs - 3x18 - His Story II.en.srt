1
00:00:01,886 --> 00:00:04,904
Today's gonna be a great day.
Still, no time to dilly-dally -- God,

2
00:00:06,068 --> 00:00:08,474
that's a fun phrase -- I have
to meet Dr. Cox in five...

3
00:00:09,113 --> 00:00:15,143
Good God! Check out those dilly-dallies!
That may be the future Mrs...

4
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:21,240
Okay, back to work. Because Dr.
Cox has hand-selected me to help him

5
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:22,168
on a research project.

6
00:00:22,432 --> 00:00:23,234
Hey, research buddy!

7
00:00:23,747 --> 00:00:26,295
We're four seconds in and I'm
already regretting my decision.

8
00:00:27,672 --> 00:00:29,787
Things Jordan says during sex! Ha!

9
00:00:30,252 --> 00:00:31,205
Are those the charts I wanted?

10
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:35,522
Noooo. They're the charts you
wanted, plus! patient history charts

11
00:00:35,688 --> 00:00:39,427
from the last ten years, which yours
truly stayed up all night organizing

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,454
not only chronologically
but by severity of condition.

13
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,649
There's a good chance
I'm gonna kill someone.

14
00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:52,065
Things you say when you
talk to your patients.

15
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:53,471
Clever.

16
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:57,092
Ah, don't bother with that, Trish.
You know, I've been getting my hair

17
00:00:57,277 --> 00:01:00,770
cut by my barber, Big Frank, for
seventeen years now. Is it because his

18
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:05,539
prices remained the same? No. Is it
because I like the way his man-breasts

19
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:09,049
feel gently resting on my shoulders
when he does my sideburns? A little,

20
00:01:10,347 --> 00:01:14,891
yes. But, mainly, it's because, unlike
you, he does just exactly what I tell

21
00:01:15,036 --> 00:01:19,458
him to do. You see, it's my way or
the highway, and since you've already

22
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:22,204
broken that dictum... you're out!

23
00:01:22,855 --> 00:01:23,241
No, but wait!

24
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,268
I already got my shifts covered
for the next two days! Besides,

25
00:01:26,414 --> 00:01:28,594
where're you gonna find somebody else?
You think Lonnie, my intern, gives a

26
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:31,815
rat's ass about acute thomrobotic
thrombocytopenic purpura?

27
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:34,399
ATTP? It killed my father.

28
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:36,342
You're in.

29
00:01:38,136 --> 00:01:41,618
It is gonna be so amazing working
on the disease that tore my family apart.

30
00:01:44,155 --> 00:01:44,671
Kiss ass.

31
00:01:46,838 --> 00:01:50,399
I guess I could go home.... But
there's plenty of important stuff I

32
00:01:50,663 --> 00:01:51,028
need to do around here.

33
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,205
Hey, Laverne. What'd
you give me if I get

34
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,589
this jelly bean into your cleavage?

35
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:56,479
A concussion.

36
00:01:56,752 --> 00:01:59,138
Guys! Three long years of
busting my hump at this place

37
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,583
and it has finally paid off!

38
00:02:01,174 --> 00:02:01,980
You got the fellowship?

39
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:04,459
No! I get to be the clown in Pediatrics!

40
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:07,173
Heeeey! That old clown was really good.

41
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:09,886
So, uh, you got some
really big shoes to fill!

42
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:14,558
Dammit, I'm funny!

43
00:02:17,796 --> 00:02:19,400
YES! He hits it at the buzzer!

44
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:21,197
Oh, no he didn't.

45
00:02:27,716 --> 00:02:28,575
Not worth it.

46
00:02:31,687 --> 00:02:34,615
Dude, my tongue is totally dry. How
many more of these wedding invites

47
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,420
do I have to lick?

48
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:36,277
Fine. Don't lick 'em.

49
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:40,332
Come on, don't get mad at Turk.
What's really bugging me is that,

50
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:41,870
thanks to Dr. Cox, I've
got nothing to do...

51
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,652
nothing to talk
about...no stories to tell.

52
00:02:46,893 --> 00:02:49,535
From the moment I woke up this
morning, I have been freaking out about

53
00:02:49,864 --> 00:02:52,752
getting married. Luckily,
Carla's being cool.

54
00:02:53,648 --> 00:02:55,729
Okay, this is your last
chance to uninvite that slut

55
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:57,032
you went out with in high school.

56
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:58,606
She's married to my brother!

57
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:00,078
Isn't that convenient.

58
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:03,174
Thank God she thinks that hot
chick, Tina, I invited is my cousin!

59
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:06,053
Well guess what! There's
no blood there, baby!

60
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:09,173
Oh, and by the way,
don't think for a second

61
00:03:09,293 --> 00:03:11,998
that your "cousin" Tina's
gonna be sitting at our table.

62
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:14,880
Oh, my God! She's in
my head! It's okay....

63
00:03:15,501 --> 00:03:16,681
Use it to your advantage....

64
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,543
Make me a grilled
cheese sandwich, woman!

65
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:21,194
Make it yourself.

66
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:38,859
Thanks for driving me to work, man.

67
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:41,861
You kidding? I wanted to see the
mailing of the invites! Once you drop

68
00:03:42,077 --> 00:03:45,279
those suckers in, there's no turning
back! I'm just mad I forgot my

69
00:03:45,395 --> 00:03:47,273
camera.... Or did I?

70
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:51,687
Ha! Say goodbye to being single!

71
00:03:55,225 --> 00:03:56,770
It's okay, sweetie,
just drop them in here.

72
00:03:57,547 --> 00:03:58,259
I don't wanna.

73
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,920
If you're nervous, come here and
I'll tell you a secret that'll make

74
00:04:02,138 --> 00:04:03,091
you feel better.

75
00:04:04,713 --> 00:04:06,076
Come here. Come here.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,187
Give me those invitations!

77
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:16,063
Sean, I'm just bummed that I'm so
busy I might not be able to do this

78
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:19,684
clown thing today. I know I'm a doctor
first, but what about that summer I

79
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:22,335
spent at clown academy? I mean, it's
starting to seem like that was just a

80
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:26,425
giant waste of time. I wish you were
here. I can't believe you've been in

81
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:28,032
New Zealand for 5 months.

82
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:31,593
I can't believe you still haven't
figured out the time difference.

83
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:33,530
It's 4 A.M. here!

84
00:04:34,568 --> 00:04:38,725
I'm sorry.... It's just I miss
talking to you...I miss seeing you...

85
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:40,755
I even miss that weird way you
sleep with your eyes open.

86
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:46,752
Sean? Sean!

87
00:04:47,146 --> 00:04:51,231
Daaaamn, Elliot's got a nice ass
for a white chick! Stop it! Just

88
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:53,980
'cause you're panicked about getting
married doesn't mean you have to reduce

89
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:55,708
every woman to her physical attributes.

90
00:04:57,304 --> 00:05:01,242
Oh, great, my new scary boss and
her amazing chest, butt, feet....

91
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:03,425
 I love feet.

92
00:05:04,308 --> 00:05:07,242
Dr. Turk! This is Bryan. You'll be
assisting me on his tumor debulking

93
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:08,014
this afternoon.

94
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:11,657
Wussuuuuuuuup, Bry-Bry! You, my
friend, have just won the lottery. I'm

95
00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:14,818
not saying I'm good, but if there
was a surgeon awards show around here,

96
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,533
it'd be called The Turkies.
You know what I'm sayin'?

97
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,861
You don't have to know what
he's sayin' -- none of us do.

98
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:23,789
Mmmm....may I have a quick moment?

99
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:24,906
Mm, excuse us.

100
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,701
What now, you mean witch?

101
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,978
I'm sorry, but if you act like a
cartoon character in front of one of

102
00:05:30,186 --> 00:05:32,973
our patients again, I'm gonna spend
the next ten years introducing you as

103
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,657
the guy who sponges off my
forehead. Okay, we're done.

104
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,914
Bryan! Dr. Turk is gonna
take you back to your room.

105
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:41,442
That was...that was glorious.

106
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,879
You didn't mind that
cocky stuff, did ya?

107
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,145
Noooo. I love "Bry-Bry".
Never had a nickname before.

108
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:51,501
Well, lemme tell you something :

109
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,312
there's plenty more where that came from, Killer B!

110
00:05:56,405 --> 00:05:57,997
What are you doing here? I
thought you had like two days off?

111
00:05:58,684 --> 00:06:00,912
Had to pick up a mouth guard from
oral surgery. Some of the kids at

112
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:05,214
the park said I couldn't jump Jones
Creek on my bicycle; so now I gotta give

113
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:08,312
'em the 4-1-1 on my
mad daredevilin' skills!

114
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:11,617
Meanwhile, back in adult world....
I was just given twelve new admits

115
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,100
and now there's no way that I
can be a clown for the kids today!

116
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:21,489
Ooh, you know, if it helps, I
could--I could examine her...for you.

117
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:23,117
Elliot, please!

118
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,471
Ow! It hurt through my helmet!

119
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:30,891
Heh. Mrs. Bell, your EKG showed a
slight irregularity, but nothing too serious

120
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,776
Maybe when my husband hears that
he'll stop worrying, go home and get

121
00:06:33,882 --> 00:06:34,534
some rest.

122
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:35,491
Hey, honey?

123
00:06:36,177 --> 00:06:39,958
Oh, and this must be your hobbit!--
I mean husband! Of course. Heh. I

124
00:06:40,376 --> 00:06:41,926
rented 'Lord of the
Rings' last night, so...

125
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:47,687
I would do Frodo.
...He's short...too. Heh.

126
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:55,228
Dr. Miller! I am attending a
hospital administrator's luncheon this

127
00:06:55,508 --> 00:06:57,303
afternoon. I would
love for you to join me.

128
00:06:58,077 --> 00:07:01,483
Not so fast, there, Bob. You forgot
to affix the warning label to your

129
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:04,706
forehead. You know, the one that
reads "Exposure to Bob Kelso can be

130
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:08,177
hazardous to your health" thus
affording the reader a fighting chance to

131
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:12,551
escape the waste and
contamination that is...Bob Kelso.

132
00:07:13,711 --> 00:07:17,068
Gosh, darn it, Perry, you are
entertaining. You know, like Howie

133
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:19,936
Mandel or a monkey in a funny hat.

134
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:22,616
Check out Cox and Kelso
fighting over Dr. New Girl!

135
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:25,730
No, she's coming with me!

136
00:07:26,357 --> 00:07:27,406
I want her.

137
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:28,428
Too late for you.

138
00:07:28,895 --> 00:07:29,396
She's mine!

139
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,513
She'll have to get one of those
cars you drive with your feet!

140
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,450
Dr. Miller, I hope to see you later.

141
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:51,156
Look, I like you...so here's some
advice: Never, ever do anything with

142
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:55,158
Bob Kelso. Don't talk to him, don't
look at him, don't even associate with

143
00:07:55,453 --> 00:07:58,608
guys his age on the outside chance that
they just shared a steam together in

144
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:02,340
that never ending Klan meeting that
they call a "country club"; right?

145
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:06,349
He is...pure evil.

146
00:08:06,996 --> 00:08:10,820
I'll remember that. Not the crazy
"where the hell is he going with

147
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:13,368
this?" ranting, but you know, the
gist -- the Bob Kelso-bad part.

148
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:16,090
Fair enough.

149
00:08:19,284 --> 00:08:22,431
Nurse Espinosa, would you mind
getting me some sugar, stat.

150
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:23,889
Why, yes, Doctor.

151
00:08:29,812 --> 00:08:33,814
Wow! This hospital rocks!
Did you two just meet?

152
00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:35,555
No. We're getting married.

153
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,800
Yep! The invitations went out today!

154
00:08:38,127 --> 00:08:42,458
Yes! You know they did, baby!
Invitations went out _today_!

155
00:08:43,665 --> 00:08:44,663
No, they didn't!

156
00:08:45,427 --> 00:08:46,834
I could never get a girl like that.

157
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:47,971
Why ?

158
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,122
Well, girls don't usually go
for the piano-playing power geek.

159
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,083
Are you a good pianist?

160
00:08:53,712 --> 00:08:54,463
Penist !

161
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:57,245
Yeah, I got a scholarship to Juilliard.

162
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:01,686
Bry-Bry! You're in the money! Girl's
love the artsy type -- you'll be

163
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,267
getting more tail than
you know what to do with.

164
00:09:03,886 --> 00:09:04,547
Ohhh, okay.

165
00:09:05,931 --> 00:09:07,285
"Tail" is sex, Bryan.

166
00:09:08,703 --> 00:09:11,388
Ohhh! Awesome!

167
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:16,997
So how far over the
Creek did you make it?

168
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:21,400
I don't know the exact distance
in terms of feet and inches, but in

169
00:09:21,872 --> 00:09:25,021
laymen's terms, I would
have to say...about halfway.

170
00:09:25,374 --> 00:09:26,426
Never stop peddling, Annie.

171
00:09:26,614 --> 00:09:28,197
You are a shoo-in for
the Little Girl X-Games.

172
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:31,272
Has anyone seen Dr. Kelso? We're
supposed to leave for that luncheon.

173
00:09:31,463 --> 00:09:34,751
Oh, that's strange. Because I
remember having a conversation with you

174
00:09:34,937 --> 00:09:37,721
about this very subject -- never
do anything with him, pure evil --

175
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:38,908
ringing any bells?

176
00:09:39,403 --> 00:09:41,435
Just the one in my head that goes
off when I'm incredibly bored.

177
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,865
Wow! Perry, people usually don't
stop caring about what you have to

178
00:09:45,066 --> 00:09:48,247
say 'til after they've been here
a few months! Oh, no he didn't!

179
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,480
That's the correct use
of that phrase, right?

180
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:52,877
I don't know, sir.

181
00:09:58,315 --> 00:09:59,915
"Oh, no he didn't!"

182
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:22,878
Ummm.... Mrs.
Bell, uh--

183
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,040
How'd I end up with him?

184
00:10:24,404 --> 00:10:24,798
Yes.

185
00:10:26,012 --> 00:10:29,637
See, I've got this boyfriend, except
he's all the way in New Zealand

186
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,983
and...well...how did you know that
Mr. Bell was the right guy for you?

187
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:37,777
Kurt was the one that was always
there for me. And at the end of the

188
00:10:37,932 --> 00:10:41,766
day, that's who you want -- the
guy who shows up when you need him,

189
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:43,524
without having to ask.

190
00:10:44,962 --> 00:10:47,914
Dr. Reid couldn't be here today,
children, so I'm here in her place.

191
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:51,289
Why're your pants so tight?
Clowns have baggy pants!

192
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:55,712
Well, Brad, I'm the type of clown
that likes to wear tight pants.

193
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,056
But the other clown has baggy pants!

194
00:10:59,063 --> 00:10:59,848
What other clown?

195
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:04,838
Hello, old friend.

196
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:08,001
Janitor!

197
00:11:10,698 --> 00:11:12,993
Man, the way Dr. Miller
stares makes me all itchy.

198
00:11:13,922 --> 00:11:16,158
What can I say to let
her know I'm in control?

199
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:18,960
Have you ever slept with a black man?

200
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:21,048
Just finish the procedure please.

201
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:25,824
That's a yes! And now her mind will
drift back to that wonderful day.

202
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,296
Wait for it....

203
00:11:29,827 --> 00:11:31,110
...And there it is.

204
00:11:31,806 --> 00:11:33,637
Dr. Miller, please,
feel free to drift off.

205
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,965
Although there is a lot of bleeding.

206
00:11:38,108 --> 00:11:40,027
You lacerated the brachial
artery. Move out of the way!

207
00:11:45,793 --> 00:11:48,456
Look, you made a mistake. Every
one of us has made a mistake.

208
00:11:48,836 --> 00:11:52,715
You should consider yourself lucky --
instead of losing his arm he'll just have

209
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:55,525
some nerve damage and limited use of
his right hand. It could have been a

210
00:11:55,701 --> 00:11:59,472
lot worse. If you want
I'll even tell him for you.

211
00:12:02,481 --> 00:12:03,768
He's a concert pianist.

212
00:12:04,738 --> 00:12:06,812
Oh. You tell him.

213
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,528
Okay, just go in there
and get it over with.

214
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:21,129
Heeeey! Bry-Bry!
What's the happie-haps!

215
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,111
My hand is feeling really weird.

216
00:12:25,047 --> 00:12:26,298
Ummm, about that...

217
00:12:27,171 --> 00:12:30,803
"I made a mistake"! Just
say it! I made a mistake!

218
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:36,407
I'm not really too sure on the
specifics, but uh...apparently there

219
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:37,704
were some complications.

220
00:12:38,881 --> 00:12:39,918
Ah, ya big chicken.

221
00:12:42,592 --> 00:12:45,547
Well, now, you are looking slim.
Are those new scrubs? Or is it the

222
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,035
fact you no longer have a soul?

223
00:12:47,406 --> 00:12:47,946
What's your problem?

224
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,483
Come on, the only reason Kelso wanted
you at that dinner is because he

225
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:52,831
knows standing next to a pretty
doctor will get his picture in all the

226
00:12:52,926 --> 00:12:56,054
medical journals. Assuming his image
actually shows up in photographs.

227
00:12:56,353 --> 00:13:01,324
So what? Publicity is good for
the hospital. Plus, pictures of us

228
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:04,540
together lend credence to the rumors
that you and I are having a fling.

229
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:07,449
I'm joking! There are no rumors.

230
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:13,571
The point is, Cox just wants you
on his side, and until that happens

231
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:15,494
he's gonna be all over you.

232
00:13:17,248 --> 00:13:18,115
Fine, maybe he's right.

233
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:18,842
Please get out of here.

234
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,567
Look, you're in with Kelso now, but
trust me, he will turn on you the

235
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,392
minute you say no to him on anything.

236
00:13:25,836 --> 00:13:28,798
Dr. Miller! Would you
care to accompany me

237
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,043
to the proctology dinner tonight?

238
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,762
Yeah! Wouldja!?

239
00:13:32,763 --> 00:13:36,004
Heh. I don't know yet.

240
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,789
Okay, kids, I've never
made balloon animals before,

241
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,531
but raise your hand
if you like your eels!

242
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:46,739
You're a horrible clown.

243
00:13:47,207 --> 00:13:48,358
Save it for the post-show, Lurch.

244
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:56,162
I think what Angry, Disturbed
Clown is trying to teach us is

245
00:13:56,163 --> 00:13:57,592
that it's never funny to push!

246
00:14:01,098 --> 00:14:01,631
Dr. Dorian?

247
00:14:02,957 --> 00:14:05,836
Okay, let's take a little
break, kids. Duck, Duck, Eel.

248
00:14:06,801 --> 00:14:09,444
Mr. Millican just died, and
his family needs to be notified.

249
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:12,242
Since I'm still kind of new at this,
I was hoping you could do it.

250
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:15,339
So you steal my research
project and now you want me to do

251
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,133
your dirty work?

252
00:14:16,134 --> 00:14:20,298
Dr. Cox told me if you said that
to say, "That's right, Melinda."

253
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,073
How you doing?

254
00:14:27,994 --> 00:14:31,660
Babe, I've never screwed up a
kid's life before. I mean, I've had

255
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:34,722
minor slip-ups, and that watch you
gave me for Christmas might still be

256
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:37,977
inside Mr. Conte,
but...nothing like this.

257
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:41,182
That watch is inside Mr. Conte?
Well, thank God! All this time I

258
00:14:41,183 --> 00:14:42,257
thought you didn't like it!

259
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:46,999
But we're talking about you. And
you, honey, you did a courageous

260
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,836
thing. You took responsibility
for your actions. Right?

261
00:14:52,781 --> 00:14:53,714
No, I didn't.

262
00:14:55,097 --> 00:14:56,111
Yes I did.

263
00:14:58,044 --> 00:15:00,699
You're just upset because it's
never easy to give someone bad news.

264
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,277
Unfortunately your grandfather's
bowel burst, causing a severe sepsis.

265
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,841
We were unable to
save him. I'm so sorry.

266
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:15,264
Again, I'm...I'm very sorry.

267
00:15:18,011 --> 00:15:19,041
J.D., what are you doing?

268
00:15:19,804 --> 00:15:23,569
Oh, just breaking some
bad news...circus style.

269
00:15:24,313 --> 00:15:25,671
You were a clown for me?

270
00:15:30,002 --> 00:15:30,964
Break's over, Binky.

271
00:15:32,592 --> 00:15:33,609
The show must go on.

272
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:40,809
So I didn't tell him.... It's
not like it would change anything.

273
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:42,408
Christopher!

274
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:47,357
"Christopher"? You only call me
Christopher when you're mad...or when

275
00:15:47,358 --> 00:15:52,929
we're having sex. Baby, are
you mad when we're having sex?

276
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,349
Sometimes.

277
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:55,092
Come. Let's take a walk.

278
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:01,467
Oh, this is bad. Okay, what did I
do? Think. I accidentally got her a

279
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:04,494
present on my ex-girlfriend's birthday.
I referred to that new cute nurse as

280
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:07,932
a young Carla Espinosa -- damn, that
was stupid. I've been known to leave my

281
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:11,287
toenail clippings on her throw pillow.
Oh, and I forgot to put the toilet

282
00:16:11,288 --> 00:16:14,889
seat down last night and she bruised
her butt! Wow, why is she marrying me?

283
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:20,646
Marrying me! Oh, God! She knows
I haven't mailed the invites!

284
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,635
I thought you might want to talk
to Bryan before you went home.

285
00:16:24,362 --> 00:16:25,283
How'd you know?

286
00:16:25,743 --> 00:16:26,580
Who you talkin' to?

287
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,017
Get in there.

288
00:16:30,514 --> 00:16:31,190
Okay.

289
00:16:32,662 --> 00:16:35,688
Bryan. Uh.... Look, I got
a confession to make, man.

290
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:40,423
Ahh, there's my dinner
buddy! Shall we head out?

291
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:44,345
Oh, no, no, no. I'm not going. I
have a date. And even if I didn't,

292
00:16:44,346 --> 00:16:46,743
I don't think I'd want to go to a
snooze-fest with a bunch of drunk

293
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:49,065
proctologists just so you could get
your picture in the latest edition of

294
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:50,823
Bend Over Weekly.

295
00:16:50,824 --> 00:16:52,399
A simple "I'm busy" would have sufficed.

296
00:16:53,018 --> 00:16:54,052
Big boys don't cry, there, Bobbo.

297
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:57,176
Why are you smiling?

298
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:59,611
Oh, I don't know, I guess I'm
just glad you wound up in my camp.

299
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:02,567
Yeah, I'm an adult, I don't actually
go to camp. Listen, if Dr. Kelso

300
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:05,018
had asked me to go somewhere that I
thought was actually good for my career,

301
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:07,821
I'd be gone so fast you'd be left here
staring at an imaginary woman's chest

302
00:17:07,822 --> 00:17:09,879
while she was trying to make a point.

303
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:13,463
I'm--I'm sorry, you're right, it's
my fault. That dress just screams

304
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:15,912
"respect me as a doctor." Heh.

305
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:18,813
You try and paint Dr. Kelso as
this jackass who turns on people who

306
00:17:18,814 --> 00:17:22,278
don't do his bidding, when you were
ready to write me off just for having

307
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:25,519
lunch. So honestly? How
are you any different?

308
00:17:26,452 --> 00:17:27,370
I'm taller than he is?

309
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:30,198
Hmm. Feel free to watch me leave.

310
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,222
It's weird. Just by the simple
act of pushing me to do the right

311
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:40,826
thing, I remembered
why Carla's the woman

312
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:43,219
I want to spend the
rest of my life with.

313
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:46,068
End of story.

314
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:48,791
You did it!

315
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:55,454
Oh, man, what a long day.

316
00:17:57,447 --> 00:17:59,719
Still, any day can be
salvaged by drinking

317
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,279
a few cold ones with a good friend.

318
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:03,484
Awesome. 'Judge Dredd' is starting.

319
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:08,028
You still have a little
clown makeup on you!

320
00:18:08,661 --> 00:18:09,400
Elliot, The Judge, please.

321
00:18:10,782 --> 00:18:12,404
Fine, I'll get it.

322
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:18,371
What the hell is she
doing? It's The Judge!

323
00:18:36,994 --> 00:18:37,764
I can't find the clasp.

324
00:18:38,194 --> 00:18:38,687
What?

325
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:39,969
The clasp! The clasp!

326
00:18:41,095 --> 00:18:41,652
I switched to frontsies!

327
00:18:42,219 --> 00:18:42,770
Naughty!

328
00:18:45,243 --> 00:18:47,426
Position One, Two, or Three?

329
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:49,106
We only had two.

330
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:53,020
Oh, yeah. Well, I have
something to show you later.

331
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:08,976
It's a mystery how one woman can
drive you crazy over and over again.

332
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:16,986
While another can bring you
right back down to earth.

333
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:22,857
In the end, you have to
trust that the perfect woman

334
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:25,301
will always lead you
in the right direction.

335
00:19:25,302 --> 00:19:27,333
So did you ever get the
guts to mail the invitations?

336
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:32,705
Look, Elliot, I don't
want to jinx this, but,

337
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:33,854
how did that just happen?

338
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,012
You were a clown for me. You
were there when I needed you

339
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:40,019
without me even having to ask.

340
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,726
Oh, my God! When did you
get back from New Zealand?

341
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:51,813
Something in your voice
told me that you needed me.

342
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:53,938
So I just...I decided to show up,
even though you didn't even ask.

343
00:20:00,924 --> 00:20:01,715
Good to see ya, J.D.

344
00:20:04,296 --> 00:20:05,526
Hey! You switched to frontsies!
