1
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,172
She's awake. Say something romantic.

2
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,384
Do you think this is a good time to start
talking about a nickname for my penis?

3
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:14,191
It's just that I-I dated this girl in college
who made the decision without consulting me,

4
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:18,831
and then all of a sudden there it was -- eighteen
straight months of it being called "Little Buddy".

5
00:00:18,832 --> 00:00:21,191
And we just didn't
like that; not one bit.

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,273
J.D., I haven't even had coffee yet.

7
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,191
Ah, you're right, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,903
"Big Al" for example....

9
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,864
Why don't you just tell me
a story? Something romantic.

10
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:31,653
Okay.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:39,000
Once there was a beautiful girl who met
a stunningly handsome young doctor....

12
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,250
He noticed her right away.

13
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,836
And she noticed him noticing her.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,590
Their first date was amazing.

15
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,183
They had so much fun together,
they felt like kids again.

16
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,773
Then it was time for their first kiss.

17
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,734
And...how was that?

18
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,653
Intense.

19
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,780
Whoa! Woo! Agh!

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,241
The next date didn't
start that well, either...

21
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,218
And that night, well...

22
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,763
...it was the most amazing
night the young doctor ever had.

23
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,432
And then what happened?

24
00:01:39,157 --> 00:01:43,407
And then the young doctor realized he hadn't
seen the beautiful girl naked in the light yet.

25
00:01:44,566 --> 00:01:45,906
Damn!

26
00:01:46,684 --> 00:01:48,585
Are you as into this as I am?

27
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:52,955
If I wasn't crazy about ya,
would I be willing to do this?

28
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,115
Doom-doom, bah,
do-doom-doom, dop-bop...

29
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,651
As I was doing the Naked Chicken
Dance that my uncle Bart had taught me,

30
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:01,192
I realized that life couldn't
get much better than this.

31
00:02:01,193 --> 00:02:02,062
...doom-doom,
dop-dop, doom--

32
00:02:02,086 --> 00:02:12,550
Okay! Now, just because Jordan thinks it's cute that you're violating her little
sister doesn't mean that you can use my guest-room for your nerdy, G-rated sexcapades.

33
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:19,679
And oh, my God, what are you doing with
my little boy, you sick, sick bastard!?

34
00:02:22,198 --> 00:02:23,567
My bad.

35
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:30,501
It's a beautiful shot of you.

36
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,398
Jus--
Come'ere!

37
00:02:32,422 --> 00:02:37,868
Ju--you filthy, filthy boy!
Filthy girl! Filthy girl!

38
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:42,433
Aww, you're okay, Little Buddy!

39
00:02:42,457 --> 00:02:45,332
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooo!

40
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:48,518
Scrubs 3x08

41
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,458
Synchro : Fabien
pour www.forom.com

42
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,327
Even though Dr. Cox got a
front-row look at Little Buddy

43
00:03:02,328 --> 00:03:06,328
-- ohhh, no! Now I'm saying it!
-- my day still started off great!

44
00:03:07,293 --> 00:03:10,178
I'm about to set a new distance
record for projectile vomiting.

45
00:03:10,202 --> 00:03:17,177
Come on.... It reminds me of my sexiest kiss: Our
honeymoon, standing waist-deep in the ocean....

46
00:03:17,178 --> 00:03:18,537
I think you were in at the bar.

47
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,021
Okay! Gotta go! Come on.

48
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:23,595
Be brilliant today!

49
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:24,921
I always am.

50
00:03:24,945 --> 00:03:26,251
Ah! Ow!

51
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:32,170
You know, I hit my head so hard
I actually saw cartoon birds.

52
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,540
Then I realized I was in Pediatrics
and it was just the wallpaper! Ha!

53
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:39,005
Stunning. Look, Tammy, as
far as your love life goes,

54
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:49,647
normally I couldn't care less who's laying your quivering body down by the fire while
your lips whisper "No, no...no" but your eyes scream, "Yes. Yes. Oh, big daddy, yes!"

55
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:57,279
But when you're dating Jordan's sissy-poo, it forces me to spend time with
you outside of the hospital, and I just won't have that. So, hhhere's the deal:

56
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,357
Don't want to have dinner with you. Don't want to go bowling with you.
And I never, ever again want to walk into my kitchen and hear you say,

57
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:09,166
"Ohh, it's waffle time! It's waffle time!
Won't you have some waffles of mine?"

58
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,203
"...waffles of mine..."

59
00:04:09,227 --> 00:04:16,628
Bottom line: We'll be bestest friends foreverest
if you just keep your face out of my face. Uh-huh.

60
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,180
Awwww.

61
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,425
She's my patient!

62
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:25,274
Hey guys, how are you?

63
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:28,196
I'm great! You know me, I'm up,
up, up, up, up, and then some

64
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:32,475
fashion nazi on the E! Network says that
pear-shaped people shouldn't wear stripes, and

65
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:35,902
whoosh, guess who's ear-deep in
mint-chocolate chip ice cream.

66
00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:36,903
Meheehee.

67
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:39,750
You know, if you leave it on the counter for
an hour, you can just drink it like a milkshake.

68
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,600
Except, watch out -- if that block's
not totally melted, hits you in the face!

69
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,795
Oh, that'd go everywhere.

70
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:45,492
Yeah, one time I got
Chunky Monkey in my eye.

71
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:47,942
What brings Ms. Tracy to us?

72
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:50,314
Oh, uh, her landlord found
her passed out on her floor.

73
00:04:50,338 --> 00:04:52,156
Yeah, lucky me, I couldn't
pay my rent this month.

74
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,428
A recent study found that doctors spend an
average of fifteen seconds listening to a patient.

75
00:04:56,452 --> 00:05:00,705
It sounds insensitive, but the
truth is it's all the time you need.

76
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:02,106
So, how you feel?

77
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,673
Awesome!

78
00:05:03,697 --> 00:05:04,569
Ms. Tracy...

79
00:05:04,593 --> 00:05:07,915
Headachy, nauseous, and embarrassed that
my landlord saw me in my granny panties.

80
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:10,462
Oh, dear. We're gonna run
some tests and figure this out.

81
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:16,151
I'll be here! ...If you....

82
00:05:17,422 --> 00:05:18,895
Ow!

83
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:24,771
Sorry! I--if that gets
infected, I'm a doctor!

84
00:05:26,496 --> 00:05:30,662
Look, you keep going to the right, so this time aim
at that guy to the left, and you'll hit the board.

85
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,746
Those two are like
best friends now, huh?

86
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,046
I know. I wonder what it
was that made them so tight?

87
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:54,314
Elliot! What are you doing here?

88
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:56,529
I'm, uh, just meeting some
friends here for drinks.

89
00:05:56,553 --> 00:05:58,159
Yes! Me too! Friends.

90
00:05:59,254 --> 00:06:00,006
Hey.

91
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:02,038
PONCH!!!!

92
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:05,885
Damn. I still got it.

93
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:11,759
Wait a second, dude,
wa--that was us.

94
00:06:11,783 --> 00:06:12,786
I know.

95
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,112
Greatest night ever!!!

96
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:23,967
Yes, Enid, I hear Baxter growling, but the fact
is you ventured into his side of the house. ...

97
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,750
Baring his teeth, huh? ...

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,520
Okay, now here's what you do. ...

99
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,000
Are you ready? ...

100
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,958
Make a sudden move!

101
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,203
Ahhh, those two!

102
00:06:41,895 --> 00:06:48,863
Sir, we've got some complaints that the new discount
stethoscopes you ordered are uncomfortably tight.

103
00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:56,948
I contacted the manufacturer, but apparently he's decided
to focus more on his hand-made smoking paraphernalia.

104
00:06:56,971 --> 00:06:59,283
Nonsense! These are fine!

105
00:07:02,536 --> 00:07:04,013
Are you okay Dr. Kelso?

106
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:08,434
Sweet dancing Jehovah!
I've punctured my brain!

107
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:13,156
Boy, oh boy, that's some rock.
When, uh, when's the big day?

108
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,086
Oh, me? No, no, never
-- my fiancé dumped me.

109
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:19,092
I'm just noticing how
beautiful his mother's ring is.

110
00:07:19,092 --> 00:07:22,852
You know, compared to the fake
one I sent back to him. Oops!

111
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:28,153
Ms. Tracy, we found some organophosphates in your
system. Have you had any recent exposure to pesticides?

112
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:30,906
Pesticides? No, I don't
have any pest problems.

113
00:07:31,162 --> 00:07:33,079
Oh, God, that must be so nice!

114
00:07:33,103 --> 00:07:34,599
They're just feelings; they'll heal.

115
00:07:34,623 --> 00:07:36,690
Don't worry. We're on top of this.

116
00:07:39,106 --> 00:07:40,562
Oh ...Bye.

117
00:07:41,303 --> 00:07:42,313
Hey!

118
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:42,963
Hey...hey.

119
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,413
Jordan just said we should
all go to the carnival tonight.

120
00:07:44,437 --> 00:07:45,207
The carnival!?

121
00:07:46,344 --> 00:07:50,510
Oh, I can't go to the carnival,
Danni. I puke at carnivals...a lot.

122
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,248
You don't really puke
at carnivals, do you.

123
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:56,332
I do. But I still love 'em!

124
00:07:56,744 --> 00:08:02,712
Look, I have an even dandier idea: Why don't
you crazy kids do something on your own?

125
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:08,253
Look, Perry, the fact is I'm Jordan's sister, so as long as I'm
staying in town you're gonna be seeing a lot of these smiling faces.

126
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:09,584
Smile.

127
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,042
So, I waxed my legs at home last night.

128
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:18,129
Yeah, how did that go?

129
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:20,389
Not great, I can't do it.

130
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:21,854
I'd rather die hairy.

131
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:25,596
Oh, Mrs. Cainings needs something to
help her sleep. Give her Haloperidol.

132
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,983
Haloperidol won't put her to sleep. Give
her a Benzo, it'll knock her right out.

133
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,898
Yeah, but, sometimes with Benzos
older people can have a bad reaction.

134
00:08:31,922 --> 00:08:34,095
Elliot, have I ever steered you wrong?

135
00:08:34,532 --> 00:08:35,783
Who suggested this?

136
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:40,295
Ohhhh! ...Smooth!

137
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,542
Benzo it is.

138
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:43,230
Hey, wait! What about this one?

139
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,425
Dude, my broccoli is hot.

140
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:52,397
Please tell me you mean temperature-wise --
because there is no way you can find broccoli sexy.

141
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:54,122
Oh...yeah...temperature-wise....

142
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,906
...And mini green
boobs-wise! What's up!!

143
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,754
Sir, I wanted to talk to you about
that hernia seminar this weekend?

144
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:07,077
Okay, sure, we can totally talk later!

145
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,524
Hey, Dr. Kelso. Hey. Dr. Kelso.

146
00:09:10,524 --> 00:09:14,078
Uh, I don't know if you heard or not, but Bernice,
the lady who does the PA announcements usually,

147
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:18,455
she just got hit by a bus, and, um, I
was on the speech team in high school...

148
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,037
...so, anyway, I was thinking
that maybe from now on,

149
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:28,876
I could do the announcements. You know,
just until Bernice gets back on her...foot.

150
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,175
Splendid!

151
00:09:40,142 --> 00:09:43,700
Dr. Cox seems to be having
fun...but I think I know why.

152
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:47,908
Ohh, ooh! Whack a newbie! Whack a
newbie! Whack a newbie! Ohh! Ohhh!

153
00:09:47,932 --> 00:09:49,662
Missed me! Ha! Ha!

154
00:09:49,686 --> 00:09:53,185
Whack a newbie! Ohh, there you are!
Ohh, there you are! Oh, come here! Ohh!

155
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:54,726
Oww! Oww!! Owww!

156
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,710
Ohhhhhhhh, whack a
newbie!!! Whack a--

157
00:09:56,734 --> 00:09:58,057
Perry.

158
00:09:59,172 --> 00:10:00,158
It's over.

159
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:01,709
Sorry.

160
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:07,036
So, we're gonna go eat some more disgusting fried food and
then look at the fat lady to make ourselves feel better.

161
00:10:07,622 --> 00:10:09,004
So, we'll meet you guys
on the Ferris wheel.

162
00:10:09,612 --> 00:10:10,753
Only if your stomach's okay.

163
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:12,825
Oh, yeah, it's only the
back-and-forthy rides that get me.

164
00:10:13,502 --> 00:10:19,955
Well, you have done it. It's Friday night, and instead of
being at home, drinking whiskey through my son's sippy cup,

165
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:26,742
I'm actually at a carnival with you, surrounded by piles
of manure even though I've yet to see a single animal!

166
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:28,308
That __is__ weird....

167
00:10:28,332 --> 00:10:31,702
Uh-huh. I'll tell you what, how
'bout we head right on over there,

168
00:10:31,702 --> 00:10:36,268
and if you can raise that hammer above your
head with those chicken bones you call arms,

169
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,870
I'll let you take a
free whack at my dome.

170
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,750
First of all, I already
raised the hammer;

171
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,164
and the only reason I didn't ring the
bell is that the game is obviously rigged.

172
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:45,864
Woo-hoo!

173
00:10:45,888 --> 00:10:46,745
Good job, son!

174
00:10:47,116 --> 00:10:48,053
Uh-huh.

175
00:10:48,077 --> 00:10:52,164
Look, the only positive thing about this
whole situation is that it's driving you crazy

176
00:10:52,164 --> 00:10:54,040
and there's nothing you can do about it.

177
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:56,144
Way to go, Gina!

178
00:10:56,168 --> 00:10:57,356
Oh, come on!

179
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:05,361
Dr. Tushy, you're needed in the OR.

180
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:08,333
Nice name, buddy. Beat
up in high school much?

181
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,062
Oh--It's okay. It's
okay. It's okay!

182
00:11:11,245 --> 00:11:11,967
What's going on!?!

183
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:13,958
She's having a reaction to the Benzo.

184
00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:21,766
There are a lot of different ways to
get the upper hand in a relationship.

185
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,450
Oh, I gave the guy half a corn-dog
so we can all ride foursies!

186
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,508
Ohhhhhhohhhhh.

187
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,097
Oh, let's go.

188
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,955
Corn-dog!

189
00:11:31,518 --> 00:11:33,070
It can happen with a simple request...

190
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,250
COULD YOU TAKE A LOOK AT MY EARS?

191
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,222
...it can happen because of a mistake...

192
00:11:41,246 --> 00:11:43,950
Mrs. Cainings is stabilized,
so DC the posey vest.

193
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:47,201
That's never happened to me before
with the Benzo. I still think--

194
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:48,643
What do you think, Carla?

195
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:50,320
Did you think that maybe I'm the doctor?

196
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,300
'Cause that's what I think. So maybe you should just DC
the vest like I asked, and keep your opinion to yourself.

197
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:07,476
Still, even when you have the upper hand, it's
important to be careful. Because some people fight dirty.

198
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:14,995
You know, Danni, I think it's amazing that you're actually
comfortable dating J.D., what with him having nailed Jordan and all.

199
00:12:18,214 --> 00:12:22,578
Uh, sorry, folks. A little problem here.
Get you down in about an hour or so.

200
00:12:28,534 --> 00:12:30,526
I don't feel so good.

201
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:40,018
Sometimes the best thing to do is just
to say exactly what's in your heart.

202
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,602
I'm sorry I puked on your shoes.

203
00:12:43,086 --> 00:12:45,022
I'm sorry I wore sandals.

204
00:12:45,046 --> 00:12:47,200
And, Danni, that whole
thing with Jordan...

205
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,057
it's so long ago, I
don't even remember it.

206
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,444
J.D., you keep a sex journal of
all your experiences under your bed.

207
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:55,605
Gotta stop showing
that to new girlfriends!

208
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:57,139
Look, you shoulda told me.

209
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:00,468
But I'm not gonna let things like this mess
it up with the guy I'm falling in love with.

210
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:03,966
Oh, thank God! Do you wanna
get some pineapple pizza?

211
00:13:04,536 --> 00:13:07,711
I think I'll probably just
go inside and wash my feet.

212
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,448
That's robot for "Goodnight."

213
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:15,541
"Peace!" Heh.

214
00:13:17,386 --> 00:13:18,894
All right, people, listen up:

215
00:13:18,894 --> 00:13:21,575
Dr. Kelso has ruptured
both his eardrums.

216
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:25,655
You could say whatever you want to him as
long as you got a smile on your face! HOLLA!

217
00:13:25,677 --> 00:13:27,669
Bob! You
stupid motherf--

218
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,274
Thanks for the kind words, gang!

219
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:45,274
Yes?

220
00:13:45,298 --> 00:13:47,830
Carla, look, I just wanted to apologize.

221
00:13:47,854 --> 00:13:50,928
I'm so glad! I didn't want
us to stay mad at each other!

222
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:53,750
It's all my fault! I should never have
listened to you in the first place.

223
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,045
I mean, I need to be a strong enough doctor
to just ignore you when you won't shut up.

224
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,530
That's so sweet.

225
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:04,657
All available medical personnel, please
report to the second floor for a cat fight.

226
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:06,306
Cat fight on the second floor!

227
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:17,006
Well, we sent some haz-mat guys over to your apartment,
but they said there were no signs of pesticides.

228
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:21,290
They also said you mixed art deco with
Indonesian antiques. I think that is so daring!

229
00:14:21,314 --> 00:14:21,999
Aww.

230
00:14:22,223 --> 00:14:23,310
Reel it in, Queer Eye.

231
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,463
Thanks, guys. Honestly, I can't remember
the last time anyone was this nice to me.

232
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:28,636
Well, you know....

233
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,433
We gotta go.

234
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:35,628
Hey, you should know your little cheap shot
didn't land, because Danni isn't mad at me at all.

235
00:14:35,652 --> 00:14:40,282
Hey, Baby! You comin' to give
pop-pop some candy? 'Cause I'm hungry!

236
00:14:40,306 --> 00:14:42,356
Oh--okay,
later's fine too.

237
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:47,169
Oh, yeah. I mean, I can--I
can feel the love all over!

238
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,095
Can you believe that Elliot,
giving me all that attitude?

239
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:58,025
You know, two weeks ago an O.R. nurse with like twenty years
experience started telling me I was tying the wrong suture.

240
00:14:58,049 --> 00:14:59,653
But I bet you listened to her, right?

241
00:14:59,677 --> 00:15:01,187
Nah, I kicked her ass out the O.R.! Heh!

242
00:15:01,211 --> 00:15:03,795
But I bet you were nice about it? Right?

243
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,932
No, I made her cry. The point is, baby, whatever
happens with this patient, it's on my shoulders;

244
00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:09,998
and it's the same with
Elliot and you know that.

245
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:12,200
That's what makes your
relationship so complicated.

246
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,935
Outside this hospital, yeah,
you're the boss of Elliot...and...

247
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:17,500
well, you know...you're
the boss of me and...

248
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,850
baby, you're the boss of everyone --
but in this building, Elliot's in charge.

249
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,154
Am I really the boss of
everybody outside of here?

250
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:29,587
Baby, you the boss of
everybody in the world.

251
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:31,334
Okay.

252
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:36,539
Dr. Dorian, Dr. Turk is
free for his rectal exam.

253
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,898
He said you'd know what that means.

254
00:15:41,912 --> 00:15:46,196
Dear Dr. Cox, I think it's important
that you know how much I care for Danni,

255
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:49,553
and how hurt I was by your attempt
to sabotage our relationship.

256
00:15:49,576 --> 00:15:51,166
Oh, de-de-de--isn't it
enough that I'm reading it!?

257
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:51,695
Oh, I'm sorry.

258
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:56,455
Always fun to be in the bathroom
listening to people talk so clearly,

259
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:01,178
you're sure they just heard
you pee. You did, didn't you.

260
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:02,346
You start and stop a lot.

261
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,480
Lovely. Here.

262
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:07,434
Uh, actually there's
great news, uh, Ms. Tracy:

263
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:08,785
We're sending you home.

264
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:13,297
Although, I sure wish we could have figured out how
that stuff got introduced into your system to begin with.

265
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:21,216
But sometimes in medicine you have to just chalk it up to life's
great mysteries, like crop circles or this gal's Adam's apple.

266
00:16:21,237 --> 00:16:22,763
I'm a girl, that's original.

267
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:27,944
Hey, you guys, I just want to say, if I
don't see you again, thanks and take care.

268
00:16:28,749 --> 00:16:29,497
You be well, darlin'.

269
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:30,339
I'll see you next time.

270
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:33,732
Wanna hear a great letter?

271
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:35,024
No.

272
00:16:39,354 --> 00:16:42,881
Hey, everybody. This
place has dynamite lamb.

273
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:44,184
What are you doing here?

274
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,353
I called him.

275
00:16:45,353 --> 00:16:50,900
Lookit, after shooting my mouth off the other
night I've been feeling a lot of...well....

276
00:16:50,923 --> 00:16:52,171
Guilt.

277
00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:53,678
No. Not that.

278
00:16:53,702 --> 00:16:55,009
Guilt?

279
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:55,925
Yes, that.

280
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:56,535
Ugh.

281
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,549
I...I don't like her to be right.

282
00:16:58,573 --> 00:17:00,922
Look, Danni, I know you're
upset about your sister and I--

283
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:04,737
J.D., if I didn't go out with the guys my sister slept
with, I wouldn't have even had a date to the prom.

284
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:05,737
Then what is it?

285
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:08,964
Last night I told you I was falling in
love with you. And you know what you said?

286
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:10,252
"Thank you"?

287
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:12,397
You asked me if I
wanted to go get pizza.

288
00:17:12,421 --> 00:17:15,000
No.... _Pineapple_ pizza.

289
00:17:15,024 --> 00:17:19,100
Sweetie, you can't take this personally.
He's a doctor -- they don't listen to anyone.

290
00:17:19,124 --> 00:17:21,398
Please don't lump us all
together with numb-nuts over here.

291
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:26,803
Oh, really? This morning I asked you to do
me a favor involving my mother. What was it?

292
00:17:29,168 --> 00:17:34,077
Well...I can only hope that it had something
to do with hiring people to kill her?

293
00:17:34,802 --> 00:17:38,158
Oh, come on. You know what? I hope you
guys listen better to your patients.

294
00:17:38,551 --> 00:17:40,546
And for some reason, right then,

295
00:17:40,546 --> 00:17:43,920
we both knew how those pesticides
had gotten in our patient's system.

296
00:17:43,943 --> 00:17:46,482
Lucky for me, I couldn't
pay my rent this month.

297
00:17:46,506 --> 00:17:49,847
Say, that's some rock.
When's the big day?

298
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:52,814
Oh, me? No, no, never
-- my fiancé dumped me.

299
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,785
I honestly can't remember the last
time anyone was this nice to me.

300
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:02,601
Hey, you guys, I just want to say, if I
don't see you again, thanks and take care.

301
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,956
She did it to herself.

302
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,846
We gotta go.

303
00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:16,375
I guess the problem with only listening
to a patient for fifteen seconds is,

304
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,324
sometimes you don't hear everything...

305
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,830
and when you finally realize
what they were trying to say,

306
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:23,750
you might've lost them forever.

307
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:27,482
Ms. Tracy.

308
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:29,032
Hey, guys!

309
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:31,463
We need to talk.

310
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:32,797
About what?

311
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:35,016
How _have_ things been going lately?

312
00:18:35,905 --> 00:18:37,998
Okay?
Why, uh--

313
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:48,866
Ahhh. Actually it has, uh,
been a couple of rough months.

314
00:18:49,668 --> 00:18:54,257
Come on, Jill. Come on.

315
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:57,463
You can never underestimate
the importance of listening.

316
00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:05,517
A quick note for all my
comatose listeners out there:

317
00:19:05,518 --> 00:19:07,963
all your lovers have moved on.

318
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:11,551
But, if it's any consolation,
my sources tell me they're happy.

319
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:14,390
Well, snooze, you
lose. In other news--

320
00:19:14,365 --> 00:19:16,047
Get off that thing.

321
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,040
Listening can effect your career.

322
00:19:18,064 --> 00:19:20,500
There you are, you deaf bastard!

323
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:23,750
I hate you so much, every
time you utter my name,

324
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:28,613
I wanna stick my fist all the way down your
throat and watch you slowly choke on it!

325
00:19:28,597 --> 00:19:31,130
Ted, I can hear now.

326
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,716
Who's Ted?

327
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,181
Listening can even mend a friendship.

328
00:19:38,951 --> 00:19:42,636
Carla, could you go get---
You know what, forget it.

329
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:46,101
No, doctor, just tell me
what you need. I'll do it.

330
00:19:47,364 --> 00:19:50,127
Just give him one gram
of Ancef for prophylaxis.

331
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:55,500
Ultimately, it keeps
you in the moment...

332
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:58,072
so you don't miss the
things that really matter.

333
00:19:58,095 --> 00:19:59,445
So say it again.

334
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:01,997
No, you have to earn it.

335
00:20:02,021 --> 00:20:03,018
I'll try.

336
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:09,100
Oh, for God's sake, we're
watching a movie here.

337
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,440
Shh!

338
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,093
Kill me.
