1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:04,818
Hospitals are filled with people who just came off 18-hour shifts.

2
00:00:04,876 --> 00:00:07,940
So when a patient dies, it's not uncommon to take them to the morgue yourself,

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:10,236
then grab a little shut-eye in their bed.

4
00:00:10,237 --> 00:00:13,103
Unfortunately, sometimes you're beaten to the punch.

5
00:00:13,412 --> 00:00:14,884
I'm up!

6
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:20,399
You can hardly notice it

7
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:22,863
It's actually kinda pretty!

8
00:00:22,864 --> 00:00:24,356
Jack-ass.

9
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,581
Look who's here.

10
00:00:25,586 --> 00:00:29,300
I'm never happy when a guy comes back into Elliot's life.

11
00:00:29,302 --> 00:00:32,265
But at least with Sean...it's entertaining.

12
00:00:32,267 --> 00:00:33,639
Thanks for the lathe.

13
00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:35,586
I should have warned you that the reason I love that place

14
00:00:35,589 --> 00:00:38,082
is that they're known for making the hottest coffee in town.

15
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:40,581
Yeah, well, no sthweat. You know, lessthon learned.

16
00:00:40,588 --> 00:00:44,551
Is it me, or do those two seem less awkward around each other?

17
00:00:52,498 --> 00:00:54,221
See ya!

18
00:00:57,476 --> 00:01:01,192
Okay, I have some news! We picked a date for the wedding.

19
00:01:02,205 --> 00:01:04,302
Tell 'em Turk.
April 24th !

20
00:01:04,307 --> 00:01:07,900
No, way! Mine is April 25th! 2006!

21
00:01:07,905 --> 00:01:11,703
Oh, the place I love in Connecticut books up early so what the hell, took a shot.

22
00:01:11,706 --> 00:01:13,263
One, two, three...

23
00:01:13,268 --> 00:01:14,461
Crazy!

24
00:01:14,477 --> 00:01:17,143
Oh, so you've never dreamt about your wedding day.

25
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:23,593
Do you, John Dorian, take Marcia Brady to be your wife?

26
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:25,012
My name is Maureen McCormick.

27
00:01:25,015 --> 00:01:28,550
Marcia, please!
Father, continue.

28
00:01:29,538 --> 00:01:31,540
No, I have not!

29
00:01:31,545 --> 00:01:34,711
By the way, Carla, I know an amazing Journey cover band,

30
00:01:34,716 --> 00:01:36,551
you should get 'em to play at your reception.

31
00:01:36,558 --> 00:01:39,832
Bambi, not everyone loves Journey as much as you.

32
00:01:39,837 --> 00:01:42,111
I don't love Journey.

33
00:01:42,116 --> 00:01:43,792
"She's just a small town girl..."

34
00:01:43,798 --> 00:01:51,023
"...Livin' in a lonely world! She took a midnight train goin' aaaanywheeeere!"

35
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:51,892
Fine, I love 'em.

36
00:01:51,896 --> 00:01:53,340
If you wanna book the band, they're called The Lovin',

37
00:01:53,348 --> 00:01:55,410
Touchin', Squeezin's and they rock!

38
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,760
Took 'em now, thank me later.

39
00:01:57,766 --> 00:02:00,040
After that, the day got worse.

40
00:02:00,847 --> 00:02:03,180
Thanks for giving me a ride down here to see Sean.

41
00:02:03,186 --> 00:02:06,473
I've never been to Sea World. What exactly does Sean do here, anyway?

42
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:08,210
Probably cleans up the seal poop!

43
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:09,221
There he is!

44
00:02:22,038 --> 00:02:23,472
Lame!

45
00:02:24,985 --> 00:02:26,951
SCRUBS 3x02 : My Journey

46
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:28,913
Subtitles by : Sebmov

47
00:02:39,588 --> 00:02:41,560
Who left this urine here?

48
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:44,302
Someone's got a secret admirer!

49
00:02:44,308 --> 00:02:47,832
Dr. Kelso? Someone left this urine specimen sitting around.

50
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:50,153
What's interesting is that the name tag's been ripped right off.

51
00:02:50,157 --> 00:02:54,512
Sweetheart, I think you're confusing interesting with boring.

52
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:56,231
I can't believe you and Carla set a date.

53
00:02:56,237 --> 00:02:57,030
Yep, it's happening.

54
00:02:57,036 --> 00:02:59,483
Wedding talk! Ohh, how lovely!

55
00:02:59,486 --> 00:03:06,952
Listen, Hilton sisters: Mr. Quinn in 206 still has a severely shattered clavicle and he needs a surgical consult now.

56
00:03:06,955 --> 00:03:10,340
And, seeing as he's _your_ patient, and _you're_ a surgeon, gosh,

57
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:15,260
I was hoping that if you two hens have an extra moment between choosing centerpieces

58
00:03:15,277 --> 00:03:20,182
and deciding just exactly how you're gonna attach that veil onto Baldy's head,

59
00:03:20,388 --> 00:03:26,432
well, it would just be super-de-duper if you could peek in in there and give him the old lookie-loo; wouldn't it?

60
00:03:26,438 --> 00:03:30,402
Anyway, about this whole setting the date thing: I mean, I'm really psyched for you guys,

61
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:32,660
it's just gonna be harder and harder for us to hang out, you know?

62
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:35,651
I mean, you're gonna be married, man! You're gonna have, like, a house!

63
00:03:35,655 --> 00:03:39,980
You know? You're gonna be spending your weekends chasing around little Arturo and Rosaria!

64
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:41,851
You mean Tamika and Fuquan?

65
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:43,281
You should...talk to Carla....

66
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:46,862
Anyway, this is the end of a major chapter in our lives, ma-- You know what?

67
00:03:46,865 --> 00:03:48,081
I'm gonna take you out tonight.

68
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:51,593
Yes, sir! We're gonna get some dinner, we'll get a nice bottle of wine....

69
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:54,042
Sounds like you're asking me out on a man-date.

70
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:56,672
Turk, why are you so afraid of loving me?

71
00:03:58,915 --> 00:03:59,730
Up!

72
00:04:01,058 --> 00:04:04,250
Whoa! Do you actually talk to each other?

73
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:06,410
Elliot, come on, he's just a dolphin.

74
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:09,882
Because, Bruce, then she would think I was crazy, that's why!

75
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,583
You know, I am so glad that we're dating again.

76
00:04:14,585 --> 00:04:16,802
Elliot, we're not dating.

77
00:04:16,816 --> 00:04:19,391
Why don't you want to be dating?

78
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:26,260
Th--well--all right.... Here.... Man! Why is everything so much easier with dolphins?

79
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,693
Because you're not trying to date a dolphin.

80
00:04:28,698 --> 00:04:32,041
No. No. Well, not after that big talk they gave us.

81
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:36,891
Elliot, last time we were together, I thought everything was going great,

82
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:39,800
and then out of nowhere you dumped me for your job.

83
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,770
I gotta be honest with you, I've never been so crushed in my entire life.

84
00:04:42,777 --> 00:04:44,403
Really?

85
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,762
That is not something that I'm happy about.

86
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:53,342
Sean, I was an intern, and if I hadn't made medicine my priority, then I wouldn't have lasted.

87
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:59,780
But...now things are gonna be different because I'm different. I'm New Elliot.

88
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:05,980
Well, do you think that, uhh...you think the new Elliot, uh, would like to go to dinner tonight?

89
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:10,111
I don't know.... She's very busy....

90
00:05:18,597 --> 00:05:22,793
Well, I'm telling you, Laverne, by this afternoon we're gonna find out whose urine this is.

91
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:24,901
I got a better idea: Why don't you do that.

92
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:29,671
I'm gonna run across the street and get my tooth fixed so I can stop looking like Larry Holmes.

93
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:34,221
Carla, you're forcing me to say something that I prayed I'd never have to say again to another woman:

94
00:05:34,235 --> 00:05:38,723
Please, please, please, put down the cup of urine.

95
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:40,783
6.50, please.

96
00:05:40,795 --> 00:05:43,463
6.50? For an egg-salad sandwich?

97
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:47,993
4.50 for the egg-salad, 2 bucks for the apple juice that you put in a urine container.

98
00:05:47,996 --> 00:05:49,391
Who would do that?!

99
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:50,993
Just the burger for me.

100
00:05:54,548 --> 00:05:57,882
Mr. Quinn, before I examine your clavicle, let me ask you something:

101
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,402
Do you think it's out of line for me to want to take my best friend here to dinner?

102
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:02,443
Well, I, uhh....

103
00:06:02,847 --> 00:06:04,590
I mean, this is like the end of an era! Okay?

104
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:08,422
We've always been known as Turk-&-J.D. Like, when we were in college, people'd be like,

105
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:11,081
"When are Turk-&-J.D. getting here?" Right? And then in med school,

106
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:13,992
everyone was like, "When _are_ Turk-&-J.D. getting here?"

107
00:06:13,995 --> 00:06:15,691
We didn't have a car.

108
00:06:15,697 --> 00:06:17,963
The point is, we were together so much, this one Indian girl only slept with him

109
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:22,251
'cause she thought his last name was "Anjadi".

110
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:23,260
It was a very good day for me!

111
00:06:23,268 --> 00:06:25,743
See! This is the kind of stuff I'm gonna miss!

112
00:06:25,745 --> 00:06:30,041
The...the reminiscing...the way your breath always smelled of curry....

113
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:31,961
All right, fine, it's a man-date.

114
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:34,943
Now, you and I, we're still on for surgery tomorrow, right?

115
00:06:34,946 --> 00:06:38,631
Right. Listen, when you slice me up, make sure you don't mess up my tattoo.

116
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:40,111
-- my fiancé, Tracy, would kill me.

117
00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:41,531
I had a tattoo once.

118
00:06:41,537 --> 00:06:44,090
Dude, you got your face painted at the hospital picnic.

119
00:06:44,095 --> 00:06:48,253
I was a cougar! Arrgh-arrgh-aaarrgh! See ya later.

120
00:06:55,696 --> 00:06:58,540
Dr. Cox, does this shade of red make me look like a clown?

121
00:06:58,546 --> 00:07:01,222
No, Barbie, no.

122
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:05,982
It makes you look like a prostitute who caters exclusively to clowns.

123
00:07:05,988 --> 00:07:07,673
Oh, I'm sorry, that was my mistake.

124
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,362
I keep forgetting that you're a horrible, horrible person.

125
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:12,340
Oooh, backbone, Barbie.

126
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:14,262
Heeee-xcuse me!

127
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:19,552
You wouldn't happen to be signing out Mr. Hudson to the on-call resident, would you?

128
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,123
Eee-yeah, why?

129
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:23,751
He's your patient, he needs a lumbar puncture,

130
00:07:23,758 --> 00:07:27,901
and you can't necessarily count on the on-call resident to do that, now, can you?

131
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:31,090
It's just that, Dr. Cox, I've got a date with this guy named Sean--

132
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:33,963
Would you do me a personal favor and excuse me just for one moment?

133
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:34,622
Yeah?

134
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:41,622
Dr. Cox, I cannot miss this dinner!

135
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,741
Oh! Barbie, I--I actually see your point.

136
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:47,470
You should, in fact, go on your little date,

137
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:52,032
because I have some busy work that's gonna take me over into the vicinity of Mr. Hudson's room,

138
00:07:52,037 --> 00:07:55,121
so I'll just pop my head in there and tell him that he's going to die.

139
00:07:55,128 --> 00:07:59,320
But, if you have a moment between dinner and giving it away for free,

140
00:07:59,326 --> 00:08:02,572
if you could pick up the phone and call Mr. Hudson's wife and kids

141
00:08:02,575 --> 00:08:09,183
and tell them about, you know, the dying...?

142
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:10,950
Oh, I know, sugar.

143
00:08:10,956 --> 00:08:18,390
This would be just the most terrific place to work on the planet if it weren't for all these sick people. Wouldn't it.

144
00:08:24,062 --> 00:08:25,125
I'm sorry!

145
00:08:25,127 --> 00:08:27,669
I just thought that, as a urine lab technician,

146
00:08:27,662 --> 00:08:32,406
you'd be at least half as interested in urine as I am!

147
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:36,832
Hey, you know, I--uh, it's not any of my business, but I think I know whose wizz that is.

148
00:08:36,837 --> 00:08:38,302
I love you!

149
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:40,812
Okay, go.

150
00:08:40,817 --> 00:08:43,042
Uh, his name is Mr. Freely.

151
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:44,022
First name?

152
00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:45,862
I.P.

153
00:08:45,868 --> 00:08:49,323
"I.P. Freely"?

154
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,913
Funny in third grade, funny now.

155
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:56,501
Listen, Stretch, if you know who this belongs to, I'd 'fess up right now.

156
00:08:56,507 --> 00:08:59,843
Otherwise, I'm gonna grab you by the back of that two-dollar haircut

157
00:08:59,846 --> 00:09:03,090
and force-feed you the sample so you can carry it around all day.

158
00:09:03,098 --> 00:09:08,043
That way, if I ever want it back, all I have to do is point you at a beaker and squeeze really hard!

159
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:11,221
Now, you got any more funny jokes you gotta tell me?

160
00:09:11,737 --> 00:09:13,232
No, ma'am.

161
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:17,330
In a hospital, every day is made up of little battles.

162
00:09:17,337 --> 00:09:19,972
Can I have everyone's attention please?

163
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:24,523
I officially don't care anymore who peed in this jar!

164
00:09:24,525 --> 00:09:28,852
Sometimes you fight them not because you want to, but because you have to....

165
00:09:29,645 --> 00:09:31,191
Shut up.

166
00:09:32,378 --> 00:09:34,722
Other times you fight for what you want...

167
00:09:34,728 --> 00:09:37,430
Sean, I can't make it to dinner.

168
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:39,943
...but what you want isn't willing to wait.

169
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:42,572
Sure, Elliot...yeah....

170
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:48,421
If you're lucky, there's no battle at all -- everything works out perfectly.

171
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:51,750
Yo, there he is! For a second I thought you weren't coming, dude.

172
00:09:51,755 --> 00:09:56,101
Hey! Turk-&-J.D.! And J.D.!

173
00:09:56,855 --> 00:09:58,331
Yeah, I'm so psyched we're doing this, man.

174
00:09:58,335 --> 00:10:00,631
So am I.
Todd! Over here, buddy!

175
00:10:00,637 --> 00:10:02,672
'Scuse me for a second, fellas.

176
00:10:02,677 --> 00:10:08,332
I'm gonna go over there and tell that girl my name's "Beer," then I'm gonna offer her some "beer nuts"!

177
00:10:08,337 --> 00:10:09,490
What's up!

178
00:10:11,638 --> 00:10:13,350
Mental five.

179
00:10:15,358 --> 00:10:17,231
You invited The Todd?

180
00:10:17,237 --> 00:10:20,423
Dude, we left at the same time. I didn't know what to say to him.

181
00:10:24,487 --> 00:10:28,270
But I thought we were gonna, like, reminisce tonight, you know? Get a little deep?

182
00:10:28,275 --> 00:10:30,582
Me too. I'm totally bummed out, all right?

183
00:10:30,595 --> 00:10:33,471
Oh, that was the hottest slap I've ever gotten!

184
00:10:33,476 --> 00:10:35,562
I can't believe I wasn't gonna come out tonight!

185
00:10:35,566 --> 00:10:37,552
Thanks for twisting my arm.

186
00:10:39,518 --> 00:10:41,330
I'm outta here.

187
00:10:41,348 --> 00:10:42,510
Hey!

188
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:51,170
J.D. Come on, man! All right, fine, man! I could have plenty of deep moments with The Todd!

189
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:57,163
Hey. You think gay dudes get turned on by their own wieners?

190
00:10:57,168 --> 00:10:58,712
Oh, my God.

191
00:11:00,957 --> 00:11:04,262
I wanted to let Turk know exactly how I felt about the way he behaved,

192
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:08,782
so I decided to throw him Mr. Quinn's chart with a little extra mustard sauce!

193
00:11:08,788 --> 00:11:10,132
Morning, buddy.

194
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:16,601
I apologize for that. To you.

195
00:11:16,606 --> 00:11:17,483
Not you!

196
00:11:17,486 --> 00:11:19,090
I thought we were friends!

197
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:23,203
Again, not you and me; me and...him. Anyway, have a nice day -- you!

198
00:11:23,206 --> 00:11:24,492
Not you!

199
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:26,540
Nor you!

200
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:32,311
Oh, hey, this whole you-leaving-the-room-whenever-I-enter-it thing that you're doing is just...

201
00:11:33,465 --> 00:11:35,100
I love it!

202
00:11:35,105 --> 00:11:38,500
Ever since I got engaged, he's been acting crazier than my fiancee.

203
00:11:38,505 --> 00:11:41,640
Although...Carla is going a little nuts about the dress.

204
00:11:41,648 --> 00:11:43,362
Dude, what's up with Tracy?

205
00:11:43,365 --> 00:11:45,611
Dude! Tracy's a guy.

206
00:11:45,628 --> 00:11:47,210
That'd make you gay.

207
00:11:47,216 --> 00:11:48,780
I am gay.

208
00:11:49,495 --> 00:11:51,143
...Neat!

209
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:56,422
Never underestimate just exactly how uncomfortable this makes him.

210
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,073
Hello?

211
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:06,180
Hey, Sean! It's Elliot! Look, I know that last night didn't go exactly as we planned it,

212
00:12:06,188 --> 00:12:08,612
so I thought maybe we could reschedule for tonight?

213
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:12,052
Look, Elliot, I think this whole thing may be a bad idea.

214
00:12:12,057 --> 00:12:14,790
Just...give me another chance?

215
00:12:14,796 --> 00:12:17,083
Well, I kind of already have plans tonight...

216
00:12:17,095 --> 00:12:19,202
...with this girl, Betty...from work.

217
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:19,891
Sean--

218
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:21,732
I'll see ya, Elliot.

219
00:12:25,165 --> 00:12:27,313
Oh, look, see, I did what I had to do,

220
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:29,760
and I don't need you judging me right now; all right, Betty?

221
00:12:34,548 --> 00:12:36,742
Oh, what do you know.

222
00:12:45,235 --> 00:12:50,162
I'm telling you, it was a clip-board. It came right out of the sky!

223
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:53,442
I'm sure it did, sir. Woo!

224
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:58,932
Wendy. Would you watch the phones for me while I go back down to the urology lab?

225
00:12:58,948 --> 00:12:59,452
Sure.

226
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,093
Nurse Espinosa.

227
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:06,232
I specifically requested that you transfer Mrs. Merchant to the Morning Side Nursing Home.

228
00:13:06,235 --> 00:13:10,052
I'd take her there myself, but then I'd run the risk of bumping into my mother,

229
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:12,582
and the last thing I need is to have another conversation

230
00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:16,000
about why she shouldn't have to spend her golden years in a bunk-bed.

231
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:20,950
Now, either do the job we pay you for, or I'll find someone else who will!

232
00:13:21,255 --> 00:13:24,271
Oh: Have a great day!

233
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:41,301
Oh, my God. The janitor's afraid of Carla! How could I use this to my advantage?

234
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:44,250
Listen, I want you to lay off J.D.!

235
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:46,360
Stop accusing him of things he didn't do!

236
00:13:47,455 --> 00:13:49,951
...And...bring him a fruit smoothie every day.

237
00:13:50,978 --> 00:13:54,980
¿El gustaria de fresa o guineo?
(Would he like strawberry or banana?)

238
00:13:55,788 --> 00:14:01,893
...El...coche... arbol...morado con queso.
(...Purple ... tree ... car ... with cheese.)

239
00:14:01,896 --> 00:14:04,103
¡Mentiroso!
(Liar !)

240
00:14:07,155 --> 00:14:08,961
Feliz Navidad.

241
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:13,893
I have to learn Spanish....

242
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:16,832
Whassup?

243
00:14:16,848 --> 00:14:21,761
Oh, nothing -- I just found out my favorite chips cause anal leakage and, oh, I'm not talking to you.

244
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:23,871
How did you get him to stop talking to you?

245
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:24,670
I don't get it, man.

246
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:26,553
All I wanted to do was take you to dinner, and you made me feel like a total idiot.

247
00:14:26,558 --> 00:14:28,901
Wait a minute, I _always_ make him feel like an idiot.

248
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,481
Why you making a big deal about this?

249
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:31,620
You never tell me how you feel!

250
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,271
Aw, dammit all! I never tell you how _I_ feel.

251
00:14:34,276 --> 00:14:35,393
I'm not talking to you!

252
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,310
Finally!
Thank you.

253
00:14:37,318 --> 00:14:40,653
I don't understand. Ever since I met you it's been like this one-way street.

254
00:14:40,665 --> 00:14:43,391
I mean, I-I-I-I tell you everything, and you tell me nothing.

255
00:14:43,406 --> 00:14:44,830
I don't get it -- what are you afraid of?

256
00:14:44,838 --> 00:14:47,852
Hey, guys. This is my fiancé, Tracy.

257
00:14:47,856 --> 00:14:50,823
This is Dr. Turk, and Dr. Dorian.

258
00:14:54,765 --> 00:14:58,363
Honest to God, I...I love this place.

259
00:15:04,846 --> 00:15:08,681
Soooo...thanks to you, Sean blew me off, but I'm okay.

260
00:15:08,688 --> 00:15:12,071
Old Elliot would have gone into a tail-spin, but new Elliot's just gonna get him back,

261
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,772
because new Elliot is a fixer.

262
00:15:13,777 --> 00:15:16,790
Like, that guy over there -- if his stitches lifted and his spleen ruptured,

263
00:15:16,797 --> 00:15:18,000
I would just go over...and fix them!

264
00:15:18,005 --> 00:15:19,303
My spleen is going to rupture!?

265
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:20,912
Relax, you're fine.

266
00:15:20,927 --> 00:15:24,790
You know what? I am just going to show Sean that he will always come first.

267
00:15:24,795 --> 00:15:27,140
Gosh, I hate to interrupt this one-gal pep-rally,

268
00:15:27,145 --> 00:15:31,630
there, Barbie, but I give this guy two weeks -- three if you are just terrific in the sack.

269
00:15:31,635 --> 00:15:34,292
Well, then it's three!

270
00:15:34,297 --> 00:15:36,160
I mean: You're wrong!

271
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:38,771
You know I just, uh, I just got off the phone with Jordan,

272
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:41,540
who told me that my son rolled over for the first time....

273
00:15:41,545 --> 00:15:44,050
Oh, my God! That's so great!

274
00:15:44,517 --> 00:15:48,592
Big who cares! Not about Jack rolling over for the first time,

275
00:15:48,596 --> 00:15:52,073
but definitely about your reaction to my son rolling over for the first time.

276
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:55,533
Point being that I missed it because I was here.

277
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,093
You might want to get a pen out and write this down,

278
00:15:57,097 --> 00:16:02,811
because here comes the inside scoop: The hospital comes first.

279
00:16:02,817 --> 00:16:04,051
Always.

280
00:16:04,058 --> 00:16:05,181
Always?

281
00:16:05,185 --> 00:16:06,521
Forever and ever.

282
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:17,730
D'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand everandeverandeverandever -- You gettin' this? -- Aaaand everandeverandeverandeveraneverandever....

283
00:16:17,805 --> 00:16:19,411
So I'll pick you up tomorrow, okay?

284
00:16:19,418 --> 00:16:20,393
Okay.

285
00:16:24,018 --> 00:16:28,613
...and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever, andeverandeverandeverandever....

286
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:31,992
You're not that comfortable with the man-on-man action, are you?

287
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:36,010
So I'm a little homophobic.... I mean, we all got our stuff, right?

288
00:16:36,017 --> 00:16:38,740
I bet, deep down inside, you're a little racist?

289
00:16:38,746 --> 00:16:40,512
Marrying a black guy?

290
00:16:40,515 --> 00:16:42,913
Dude, how pissed are your parents, honestly?

291
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:46,391
So, what makes you so uncomfortable? Is it the sex?

292
00:16:46,396 --> 00:16:47,272
Don't get me wrong

293
00:16:47,276 --> 00:16:50,311
I don't love the idea of kissing anyone with a mustache.

294
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:53,851
That's why I always pretend to have a cold when Carla's aunt comes to town.

295
00:16:58,115 --> 00:17:04,540
What really freaks me out, though, is the thought of being that open with another guy -- any guy.

296
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:07,501
I don't know what it is, I mean that's just the way I been my whole life.

297
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:11,661
Maybe...maybe it's because I'm scared, you know?

298
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:15,283
Dude...that's a little gay.

299
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:20,511
What?

300
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:23,092
Nurse Espinosa, I feel bad about what happened before;

301
00:17:23,106 --> 00:17:26,473
and so I went and searched through like forty bags of garbage....

302
00:17:26,475 --> 00:17:32,292
And I found the torn off urine label. Also found half a tooth.

303
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:34,113
Over here, jumpsuit!

304
00:17:34,117 --> 00:17:36,732
Mr. Thomasberg, let's get you to the lab!

305
00:17:38,037 --> 00:17:42,730
Hey, studly! Now, when you were out rooting through the dumpster,

306
00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:45,713
you didn't stumble across your own testicles, did'ja?

307
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:49,773
Hey, you know that long line of trembling peons that are so afraid of you?

308
00:17:49,776 --> 00:17:51,380
Well I'm not in that line.

309
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:52,121
Oh, you're not?

310
00:17:52,128 --> 00:17:54,640
No. I'm not in anybody's line.

311
00:17:54,645 --> 00:17:57,050
This is a Chicklet!

312
00:17:57,058 --> 00:17:58,330
I gotta go.

313
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,900
I'm always happy when someone wins a battle.

314
00:18:09,908 --> 00:18:13,082
Because around here, you get your fair share of disappointment.

315
00:18:49,686 --> 00:18:52,333
I guess in the end you have to fight for things that really matter.

316
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:54,353
Like pride in your work...

317
00:18:56,495 --> 00:18:58,070
...or your friendship.

318
00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:00,601
You know, I'm actually starting to like Journey.

319
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,803
Well you're gonna be very pleased with the next twenty-three songs.

320
00:19:03,806 --> 00:19:08,290
You know, the fact that you're even here for an end-of-an-era celebration is enough,

321
00:19:08,298 --> 00:19:10,563
we don't have to, like, get all deep or anything.

322
00:19:10,568 --> 00:19:13,190
No, I wanna try this, man.

323
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:19,912
Okay, Um.... Ever since Carla and I set the date for the wedding, I started thinking.

324
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:25,010
You know those lame-ass couples that get engaged but they never actually get married --

325
00:19:25,018 --> 00:19:29,981
they just cruise along year after year, without making any real kind of commitment?

326
00:19:29,985 --> 00:19:33,691
Dude, I wanted to be one of those couples, man!

327
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:36,401
Hey, Puki, can we get two appletinis, please?

328
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:39,690
And sometimes, all you can do is grit your teeth and tell the truth.

329
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:40,572
Hey.

330
00:19:41,106 --> 00:19:45,070
Look, I was planning on coming here and telling you that you'll always come first.
