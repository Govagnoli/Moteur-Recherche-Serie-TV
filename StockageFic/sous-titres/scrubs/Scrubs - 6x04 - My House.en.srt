1
00:00:02,161 --> 00:00:04,856
<i>Elliot has just finished her last shift at Sacred Heart</i>

2
00:00:04,857 --> 00:00:07,456
<i>before starting her new career in private practice.</i>

3
00:00:07,654 --> 00:00:09,008
Can't believe it's all over.

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:13,636
God, so many memories, so many many memories.

5
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:17,582
Who wants to say something first?

6
00:00:18,404 --> 00:00:23,920
Elliot your new office is right there.
Nothing gonna change but your lab coat.

7
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:25,678
Anyone else wanna go?

8
00:00:28,317 --> 00:00:30,687
<i>Speaking of new jobs, I wasn't thrilled</i>

9
00:00:30,688 --> 00:00:33,805
<i>that my pregnant girlfriend w
as offered a research grant in Tacoma.</i>

10
00:00:34,138 --> 00:00:35,024
<i>On the upside</i>

11
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:37,105
<i>I can give her a dramatic "don't go" kisses</i>

12
00:00:37,106 --> 00:00:38,094
<i>whenever I felt like it.</i>

13
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:40,265
Oh that was hot stud

14
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:42,577
but I think it's just my leg that supposed to be up.

15
00:00:45,185 --> 00:00:48,387
JD, this is gonna be such a tough decision.

16
00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:50,101
Ok, I don't know if you're aware of this

17
00:00:50,102 --> 00:00:51,853
but I've been really digging you lately.

18
00:00:51,854 --> 00:00:53,408
No I'm aware baby.

19
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:55,245
<i>Oh my god, she likes me.</i>

20
00:00:55,778 --> 00:00:57,391
Still I'd only be gone 4 month,

21
00:00:57,392 --> 00:00:58,804
and you don't wanna be around me when I'm pregnant.

22
00:00:58,805 --> 00:01:00,189
All women of my family go phycho.

23
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,790
- Yeah but...
- I wasn't finished!

24
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:06,794
You know, I'm back, I'm back,
it's perfectly fine, I just hit the wall.

25
00:01:06,795 --> 00:01:09,388
Look whatever your decision is I support you.

26
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:11,916
Oh, you're so awesome JD.

27
00:01:12,454 --> 00:01:14,150
<i>My lips tasted weird.</i>

28
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:19,208
Hey, look who I brought to see her mama.

29
00:01:19,502 --> 00:01:20,952
Somebody else's child?

30
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:26,208
We had a code pink people,
somebody just stole a baby.

31
00:01:28,139 --> 00:01:29,068
just shut that.

32
00:01:44,123 --> 00:01:47,285
Baby, so after I take this kid back to the nursery,

33
00:01:47,286 --> 00:01:50,098
I was thinking maybe
we could pack up you and Isabella at home?

34
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:52,281
Turk, I can't handle going home right now.

35
00:01:52,807 --> 00:01:54,898
This place is really expensive honey.

36
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:58,373
I don't know if you noticed but
the ice-pack you've been put on your hooey,

37
00:01:58,374 --> 00:02:00,211
run about 42 bucks of pop.

38
00:02:00,534 --> 00:02:02,979
My body's a disaster zone right now,

39
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,191
but it will get better.

40
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:06,049
So if you want to get near it ever again

41
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,989
I would stop talking about money.

42
00:02:09,736 --> 00:02:12,760
Alright who can tell me
anything about Mr Pierce?

43
00:02:12,761 --> 00:02:15,622
He uses oil heater
at his house in New Hampshire.

44
00:02:15,623 --> 00:02:18,118
That answer was either
very sarcastic or very stupid.

45
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:20,531
Either way I'm whacking you
with my clipboard brace yourself.

46
00:02:20,532 --> 00:02:22,840
Wait. He's hypoxic,
with a clear chest x-ray,

47
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:25,485
which can be a sign
of carbon monoxyd poisoning.

48
00:02:26,093 --> 00:02:27,538
I learn that watching House.

49
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:29,556
House is a genious.

50
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:31,821
That's it I'm waking both of you.

51
00:02:33,355 --> 00:02:36,547
Look, I know you all curl up
on your futons at night

52
00:02:36,548 --> 00:02:39,729
dreaming of cracking
a real life medical mystery

53
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,214
so that some doctor / supermodel
will want to touch your eruption button.

54
00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:44,989
But, here's the bad news,

55
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,014
this isn't a tv show,
there aren't any cameras over here,

56
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:51,083
real medical mysteries
don't happen every week

57
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:53,510
and doctor damn sure
don't look like models,

58
00:02:53,511 --> 00:02:54,877
they look like Rex.

59
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:57,204
What?

60
00:02:57,743 --> 00:02:59,020
Chin up, you ugly bastard.

61
00:02:59,021 --> 00:03:01,535
So if you wanna solve a real mystery,

62
00:03:01,536 --> 00:03:04,406
go ahead and figure out
who's taking my NY Times every sunday.

63
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:10,365
Or better yet how about why anybody on the planet
actually thinks Dan Cook is funny.

64
00:03:10,545 --> 00:03:14,219
As far as Mr Pierce goes,
he has run-of-the-mill pulmonary embolism

65
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,614
and I know, I know
it is a boring medical diagnosys.

66
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,520
But that's what hospitals are : boring.

67
00:03:24,517 --> 00:03:25,745
Here, there's that baby you stole.

68
00:03:26,677 --> 00:03:28,745
Kinda miss the little cutie.
We really bonded.

69
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:30,927
Oh come on,
that kid doesn't remember you.

70
00:03:37,487 --> 00:03:39,734
So you're really cool
if Kim decides to take this job?

71
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:42,114
Hell no man,
she's gonna be all way in Washington

72
00:03:42,277 --> 00:03:45,615
and phone sex is out of the question because
I'm righty when I'm talking on the phone

73
00:03:45,716 --> 00:03:46,722
but I'm also a righty when I'm teaching

74
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:48,852
mini JD who daddy is.

75
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:50,573
Can't you work your way around that?

76
00:03:50,574 --> 00:03:51,744
I'm screwed dude,

77
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:54,324
I mean if I ask her to stay
she's gonna resent me forever.

78
00:03:54,325 --> 00:03:56,534
You know what I've got to do,
I've got to be the best boyfriend ever

79
00:03:56,535 --> 00:03:58,164
so she never wants to leave me.

80
00:03:59,048 --> 00:04:00,152
Turkleton.

81
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,435
I need a word.

82
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:07,437
I wanted to give you
your payckeck in person,

83
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:09,842
so you can handed back to me
to pay your bill.

84
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:12,069
Why you don't just hold on to that sir.

85
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,294
That's not how it works.

86
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,225
Now I'm going to handed it to you,

87
00:04:15,226 --> 00:04:18,752
I want you to look at it,
sigh, and give it back to me.

88
00:04:21,376 --> 00:04:22,757
Splendid.

89
00:04:22,758 --> 00:04:25,537
Nurse Espinoza, Mi hospital es su hospital

90
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:27,852
No problemo chiefo.

91
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:34,918
Nice new digs,

92
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:37,109
looks like you can use
a new coat of paint, though.

93
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:39,405
If you're interested...

94
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:41,995
PAINTER
CALL JANITOR

95
00:04:41,996 --> 00:04:42,691
Thank you.

96
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:45,071
Now, I just gotta find someone
to replace this rug.

97
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:49,649
Air traffic controller, gemologist,
captain of industry, middle reliever,

98
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:51,239
ruggist.

99
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:54,678
I've invented a machin
that prints business cards.

100
00:04:55,483 --> 00:04:57,086
That's already been invented.

101
00:04:57,413 --> 00:04:58,922
Oh yeah I know but mine

102
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:02,043
also fires paint pellets.

103
00:05:02,044 --> 00:05:03,503
How about it? Observe.

104
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,482
Curved off to the left,

105
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,966
that was working great yesterday at the zoo.

106
00:05:13,221 --> 00:05:16,193
Dr Reid, I thought
I would just stop in and say goodbye.

107
00:05:16,957 --> 00:05:18,977
Why? I'll still be working here.

108
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,825
Yes, but you won't
be working for Sacred Heart,

109
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:23,883
The place that spent
a fortune training you

110
00:05:23,884 --> 00:05:26,327
only to have you take off
for greener pastures.

111
00:05:26,686 --> 00:05:28,745
You're like a prostitute
that gets payed upfront

112
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:31,002
and then bolts from the restaurant
after dinner.

113
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,127
It's about common courtesy Reid

114
00:05:33,614 --> 00:05:36,911
either to your boss
or to a kind-hearted john

115
00:05:36,912 --> 00:05:39,467
who's given you a lot business
over the years.

116
00:05:39,782 --> 00:05:43,802
So goodbye miss Mei-ling
of gentle oriental escort

117
00:05:43,803 --> 00:05:46,656
and goodbye Dr Reid.

118
00:05:47,063 --> 00:05:50,191
I won't be speeking
to either of you ever again.

119
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:53,867
You're seriously gonna ignore me
because I took another job.

120
00:05:57,974 --> 00:05:59,934
Hey Sarah, how are you?

121
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,263
I'm Dr Dorian.

122
00:06:01,264 --> 00:06:04,004
Look you were in a consciousness
when they brought you in.

123
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:05,801
Do you have any family
you want us to contact?

124
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,427
That's just me and my dog Charlie,

125
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:10,667
you can try him
but he rarely answers his cell.

126
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:15,738
What's Charlie's cellphone number?
1-800-cats-are-lame?

127
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:19,145
Ok.

128
00:06:19,738 --> 00:06:22,245
Other that the obvious loss of sense of humor,

129
00:06:22,246 --> 00:06:25,565
I undertand you've been having palpitation
and shortness of breath.

130
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,989
We'll run some tests
and see what's happening.

131
00:06:29,651 --> 00:06:30,732
There's my girl.

132
00:06:31,463 --> 00:06:34,128
Hey I got you something. It's a star.

133
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:36,372
You can get them of this website
and I named it after you.

134
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,626
That so sweet.

135
00:06:37,627 --> 00:06:40,290
Unfortunatly "Kim" was taken,
so I tried "Kim" with 2 m's ,

136
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,951
"Kim" with 3 m's, "Kim1", "Kim2".

137
00:06:42,952 --> 00:06:43,962
What was it called?

138
00:06:43,963 --> 00:06:45,869
FreckleFart90

139
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:49,461
Oh, for freckle on my ass,
my lactose intolerence

140
00:06:49,462 --> 00:06:51,969
and the fact that
I graduated high school in 1990.

141
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,179
Yes.

142
00:06:53,407 --> 00:06:55,008
<i>That was so lucky.</i>

143
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:56,538
How can I ever leave you?

144
00:06:57,845 --> 00:06:59,065
<i>It's working.</i>

145
00:07:04,068 --> 00:07:06,628
Damn it. Is it the sight?

146
00:07:11,051 --> 00:07:12,115
I've been hit.

147
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:14,482
Not the sight.

148
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:19,106
Dr Cox, I need your help.

149
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:22,336
- Make it quick. I gotta be somewhere.
- Where?

150
00:07:22,337 --> 00:07:25,029
Anywhere you and I aren't talking.
Go.

151
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:28,312
Ok, it's Carla,
I can't get her out of here

152
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:30,020
and she listens to you, so I was think...

153
00:07:31,656 --> 00:07:32,565
Say no more.

154
00:07:33,826 --> 00:07:35,612
You know yelling at those intern

155
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:36,982
made me realize

156
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:41,172
how monous it is facing
the same decease day after day

157
00:07:41,173 --> 00:07:43,908
and then no matter
what I do to entertain myself,

158
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:45,665
I'm still bored,

159
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:50,105
whether it's reading the paper
or shaving the side burns off of a resident

160
00:07:50,106 --> 00:07:53,176
because his license plate says "Party Doc".

161
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:57,360
About my calculation
that rant is cost me $27.

162
00:07:59,123 --> 00:08:00,655
Excuse me Dr Cox.

163
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:02,237
Yes Party Doc?

164
00:08:02,238 --> 00:08:04,633
I heard crying
coming from this room last night,

165
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:06,163
thought you should know.

166
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:09,206
Don't look at me, I wasn't crying.

167
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:12,668
Maybe it was Mrs mehleison,
she's just got her baby yesterday.

168
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:14,995
Maybe she's got post-partum depression.

169
00:08:15,525 --> 00:08:16,920
One of us needs to check this out.

170
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:18,206
I got it.

171
00:08:19,593 --> 00:08:21,044
- Oh!
- What?

172
00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:22,380
- I can't do it.
- Why?

173
00:08:22,381 --> 00:08:23,957
Because her husband is orange.

174
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:34,327
- Good afternoon.
- What's up?

175
00:08:37,202 --> 00:08:39,849
Oh, Dr Kelso,
what radiologist is on call today?

176
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:43,420
Oh right, the silent treatment,

177
00:08:43,681 --> 00:08:44,886
well unfortunatly for you,

178
00:08:45,112 --> 00:08:48,124
the Reid family is actualy giving each other
the silent treatment for generations.

179
00:08:48,346 --> 00:08:50,073
This one time my dad
wasn't talking to my mum

180
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,612
because she stop boffing the gardener
right at the height of weed season.

181
00:08:54,638 --> 00:08:55,988
I know, she wasn't thinking.

182
00:08:55,989 --> 00:08:58,567
Anywho, she finally broke him down
with the little ditty.

183
00:08:58,568 --> 00:09:00,922
Nobody can hear it without chiming in.

184
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:06,840
"Lollipop, lollipop,
oh lolly, lolly, lolly, lollipop"

185
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:09,978
"Lollipop, lollipop,
oh lolly, lolly, lolly"

186
00:09:11,225 --> 00:09:12,472
"Lolly pop."

187
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:17,864
He was about to crack, Ted!
What the hell?

188
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:22,099
"Lollipop, lollipop,
oh lolly, lolly, lolly, lollipop."

189
00:09:23,635 --> 00:09:26,814
Well your labs are back
and it's definitively heart failure.

190
00:09:27,315 --> 00:09:29,456
But there are no blockages,
no viruses present

191
00:09:29,457 --> 00:09:33,176
and you have no family history
of coronary desease.

192
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:36,012
So why do I have heart failure?

193
00:09:36,545 --> 00:09:38,923
<i>Even though real hospitals
aren't like TV shows</i>

194
00:09:39,057 --> 00:09:40,843
<i>that doesn't mean
there aren't mysteries</i>

195
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:44,162
<i>like why a healthy woman heart is failing</i>

196
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:45,580
<i>or why a grown man is orange.</i>

197
00:09:45,756 --> 00:09:47,033
Grab a seat people,

198
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,864
this just got interesting.

199
00:09:56,412 --> 00:09:58,127
Elliot I wouldn't take that
if I were you.

200
00:09:58,436 --> 00:10:01,881
Or why a friend is made a you
instead of the guy that being a jerk.

201
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:03,362
Don't even talk to me.

202
00:10:03,673 --> 00:10:07,796
<i>Of course for me the biggest mystery
was what my girlfriend gonna do about her job offer.</i>

203
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:12,416
So I spent the entire day thinking, I can't leave you for 4 month.

204
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:16,553
But you're so amazing about the whole thing
that I finally call them and accepted the job.

205
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:19,634
They want me there tonight.
Can you believe it?

206
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:23,210
Ok, I'm gonna get us some muffins.

207
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:26,858
You're ok?

208
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,324
Finally.

209
00:10:32,535 --> 00:10:33,382
<i>No.</i>

210
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:39,692
So, you're sure you don't mind
taking me to the airport tonight?

211
00:10:39,911 --> 00:10:41,577
Of course not babe.

212
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:44,215
<i>I had to find a new plan to keep Kim from leaving.</i>

213
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:47,739
<i>Unfortunatly work got in the way.</i>

214
00:10:48,164 --> 00:10:50,618
<i>The only thing worse that not knowing
why a patient is crashing</i>

215
00:10:50,832 --> 00:10:54,132
<i>is being offered help by the hospital
grief counselor, Dr Headrick.</i>

216
00:10:54,492 --> 00:10:55,595
You need help old friend?

217
00:10:55,877 --> 00:10:58,695
Oh yeah her kidney's are failing,
give her a pep-talk, stat.

218
00:10:59,975 --> 00:11:02,731
Well treating her emotionaly would have
nothing to do with her medical well-being.

219
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:05,447
You know maybe instead of lashing out at me,

220
00:11:05,852 --> 00:11:08,650
you should turn that anger
to the person you're really mad at.

221
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:10,628
Mumy?

222
00:11:11,624 --> 00:11:12,638
Just a guess.

223
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:15,488
It's got the be some reason
why you're such a d-bag right?

224
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:17,184
d-bag.

225
00:11:19,163 --> 00:11:24,336
Ok we have a 31 year old male
who is as orange as a NBA game ball.

226
00:11:24,581 --> 00:11:25,511
Could you help me why?

227
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:27,559
- I've got an idea.
- Yeah I've got an idea too.

228
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:28,863
If you wanna work,

229
00:11:29,053 --> 00:11:31,543
let's stop paying for the room
so you can go home,

230
00:11:31,544 --> 00:11:33,347
then you can come back
and get payed to work.

231
00:11:35,114 --> 00:11:36,758
Turk. I just need a break from the baby.

232
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:41,758
Mr mehleison might be a vegetarian
he's always eating carrots.

233
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:47,045
But carrotine like jaundice turns you yellow
just like a blood disorder turn you blue

234
00:11:47,046 --> 00:11:52,715
and tomatoes can turn you red. Sadly,
there isn't anything on god green earth
that turns you orange.

235
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:55,088
Maybe he got freaky with some cheetos.

236
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,016
swing and a miss, Webster. Next!

237
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,766
Maybe he use so fake-tan cream.

238
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:03,732
Used it once,
turn me orange all over.

239
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,635
There were no foreign substances
found on his skin

240
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,379
but kuddos Keith
on finally outing yourself.

241
00:12:11,242 --> 00:12:15,566
Hello Stacy, Rebecca, Larry...

242
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:20,159
... Jenifer, Lyle, portly island boy.

243
00:12:22,037 --> 00:12:23,704
I can't get Carla leave this place.

244
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,009
Yeah I don't give a rats doo-doo maker.

245
00:12:27,943 --> 00:12:28,963
Why does she hate me?

246
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:33,400
Don't say hate, gandhi, you keep through
that word around so much it's lost all of its meaning.

247
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:38,117
Now I have to find another word stronger
than hate to describe how I feel about others.

248
00:12:42,992 --> 00:12:44,955
I mega-loathe you all.

249
00:12:45,237 --> 00:12:45,860
Good day.

250
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:52,891
Here's Dr Cox, he's one of my colleagues,
he's gonna help me with your diagonsys,

251
00:12:53,143 --> 00:12:54,386
we kind of are team mates.

252
00:12:54,705 --> 00:12:56,632
So Sarah here has the beginning
to what looks like...

253
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,740
I can read a chart newbie,
now leave,

254
00:12:58,932 --> 00:13:01,040
before I put rhinestone collar
around your neck

255
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:02,917
have you fixed and make you my lap doctor.

256
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:05,412
- Again, team mates.
- Go.

257
00:13:06,547 --> 00:13:09,751
It said on your chart that you are,

258
00:13:10,148 --> 00:13:10,981
you're single.

259
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:12,196
That's right.

260
00:13:17,989 --> 00:13:20,408
<i>Kim's leaving the pack and I still
got no plan to make her stay,</i>

261
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:23,713
<i>it's go time. Just say the first thing
that pops into your head.</i>

262
00:13:24,516 --> 00:13:26,965
I'm rich.
You don't have to take that job.

263
00:13:27,258 --> 00:13:28,400
You're not rich.

264
00:13:28,727 --> 00:13:29,834
Oh! Yes I am Kim.

265
00:13:30,462 --> 00:13:33,157
And this right here, my dope-ass mercedes.

266
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:44,142
I didn't want to tell you
'cause I wanted you to like me for me.

267
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:45,908
You're an idiot, JD.

268
00:13:46,106 --> 00:13:47,236
Am I Kim?

269
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:53,198
Dr tabiti, Dr tabiti, I'm on the car.

270
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,130
Larry, Larry, I'm on the car!

271
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,165
There's my girl.

272
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,489
Why you didn't just tell me
you didn't want me to go?

273
00:14:12,793 --> 00:14:15,897
What am I supposed to say Kim?
"Don't go, 'cause I'll miss you."?

274
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,518
Kim, we both know
you're always taking that job.

275
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,570
I was always gonna want you not to.

276
00:14:23,043 --> 00:14:26,406
Look, it's only 4 month.
It's really good for my career.

277
00:14:27,137 --> 00:14:29,208
<i>And then I said something
I wish I hadn't.</i>

278
00:14:29,793 --> 00:14:32,139
Why don't you just do what's best for you.

279
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:36,605
You know what?
I'll get myself to the airport.

280
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:53,633
You usually have to go to a van convention
to see art of the quality,

281
00:14:54,802 --> 00:14:55,537
you do.

282
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:59,405
I've got to confess though, I cheated a little bit.
I used an actual head to the morgue.

283
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:00,106
as a model.

284
00:15:01,471 --> 00:15:03,130
Be careful,
it's actually around here somewhere.

285
00:15:09,553 --> 00:15:11,311
I think I heard something break.

286
00:15:11,983 --> 00:15:12,831
Here we go.

287
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:16,109
Podiatrist?!?

288
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:20,923
I also buy and sell feet,
so anyway you wanna go, I got you covered.

289
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:22,467
Great.

290
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,000
Eh Elliot,
you're gonna finish that muffin?

291
00:15:36,677 --> 00:15:38,304
Why are you so pissy with us?

292
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,200
Why is Sarah dying?

293
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,441
Why is that guy orange?

294
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,171
<i>Around here, sometimes
you do wish it was more like tv.</i>

295
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:52,423
<i>And a bigger than life character like House
would just show up and conveniently solve everything.</i>

296
00:15:55,774 --> 00:15:58,000
Oh yes, the huddled masses.
Carla!

297
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,129
I see you're trying one of this
etablishment disgusting new tomato muffin.

298
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:06,814
Do you know who elses just love tomatoes?
Our little orange friends, Mr mehleison.

299
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:11,078
As you correctly pointed out,
the only thing he like more than tomatoes

300
00:16:11,413 --> 00:16:12,189
are carrots.

301
00:16:12,498 --> 00:16:15,047
And if carrots turn you yellow and tomato turn you red,

302
00:16:15,714 --> 00:16:19,636
what color would he most likely turn
if he would have gorge himself on both those items.

303
00:16:20,924 --> 00:16:22,476
- Orange.
- Correct.

304
00:16:23,646 --> 00:16:26,596
And Gandhi, I understand that you are confuse
why private practice Barbie

305
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:29,611
has a beef with you and
your scorning little life partner.

306
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,150
Kelso is the one being a jurk not us.

307
00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:37,652
Yes but even though that horny old raisin
is acting like an ass in doing so,

308
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:41,022
he actualy aknowledging that
she's ready to move on professionnaly.

309
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,960
Guess who hasn't aknowledged that?

310
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,700
Nothing's gonna change but your lab coat.

311
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,204
He's right.

312
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,702
I mean lately all this great stuff has been happen
to you guys : settling down and having a baby.

313
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,866
Dear god, Barbie we get the point.

314
00:16:55,784 --> 00:16:57,144
This roughly be my time.

315
00:16:58,356 --> 00:16:59,717
Now newbie,

316
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,476
as far as your patient is concerned.

317
00:17:03,177 --> 00:17:07,008
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,
ever heard of it?

318
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,652
I haven't.

319
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,998
takotsubo cardiomyopathy
also known as broken heart syndrom

320
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:17,876
is one severe emotional trauma triggers
a weakening of the heart muscle.

321
00:17:18,694 --> 00:17:23,000
On her chart, you indicate that she was single,
yet I noticed that she was still wearing her wedding ring.

322
00:17:24,014 --> 00:17:27,536
Turns out her husband has just died
and she wasn't ready to take the ring of yet.

323
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:32,436
I'm betting that her grief over
his passing is what cause her heart failure.

324
00:17:33,023 --> 00:17:33,329
And

325
00:17:33,923 --> 00:17:37,128
no, no,
I'm not superman,

326
00:17:37,782 --> 00:17:40,310
I'm just Dr Cox.

327
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,300
Thanks for the coffee.

328
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,611
She's gonna need a lot more councelling
but we'll get her there.

329
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:54,115
Well not "we" so much as "me".

330
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,986
Your part the bungling
of the diagnosis is done.

331
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,960
I can't believe you can have
a heart failure just for being sad.

332
00:18:00,486 --> 00:18:01,810
I mean, how you supposed to treat that?

333
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,400
He's coding,
get me box of kittens, stat.

334
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:20,161
Possible side effects of kittens includes

335
00:18:20,436 --> 00:18:22,389
- sneezing,
- tiny scratches

336
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,067
and erectile dysfunction.

337
00:18:25,682 --> 00:18:27,670
Would I be a great spoke person for things.

338
00:18:28,031 --> 00:18:30,002
Could you do me a favor next time?

339
00:18:30,321 --> 00:18:32,791
Just remember to take care
of your patient emotionaly.

340
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:37,099
Some of them in a good place
they heal quicker,

341
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:41,226
on a negative place that could destroy
the body, the mind, destroy everything.

342
00:18:41,976 --> 00:18:43,186
<i>Even a relationship.</i>

343
00:18:44,047 --> 00:18:45,324
Will you excuse me for a second.

344
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,726
Oh god yes.

345
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:58,420
This is the final boarding call
for actioneer flight 65,
non-stop service to tacoma Washington.

346
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,317
Kim! Wait!

347
00:19:11,118 --> 00:19:14,425
I couldn't let you leave without you know
that I completly support your decision.

348
00:19:19,671 --> 00:19:20,971
Let's get that shirt off.

349
00:19:23,003 --> 00:19:24,247
There they are.

350
00:19:29,578 --> 00:19:32,474
So then everyone
watches us do it and claps after.

351
00:19:32,932 --> 00:19:33,867
The end.

352
00:19:34,217 --> 00:19:35,265
Sweet story.

353
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:39,608
I'm sorry I was such an idiot,
I just... I'm really gonna miss you.

354
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,708
Look, we gonna talk every night, we gonna
get you a handfree headset for phone sex.

355
00:19:43,987 --> 00:19:44,930
We gonna get through it.

356
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:48,935
Oh god, I'm gonna be so big when I get back,
you not gonna want to touch me.

357
00:19:49,686 --> 00:19:50,779
Ridiculous,

358
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:53,912
- I've been with a lot of big girl.
- Oh yeah?

359
00:19:55,877 --> 00:19:58,747
<i>The best part of a breaking mystery
is its resolution.</i>

360
00:20:01,258 --> 00:20:03,669
<i>Whether you finally realize
what your friend was looking for.</i>

361
00:20:04,187 --> 00:20:05,848
So tell me about your new job.

362
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:07,775
It's amazing

363
00:20:08,894 --> 00:20:11,014
<i>Or just figuring out
why a guy was orange.</i>

364
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:13,705
Am I gonna ever look normal again?

365
00:20:14,898 --> 00:20:18,019
Oh sure, sure as long as
you cut back on your vegetables.

366
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:21,174
Maybe you known,
buy some clothes from this decade.

367
00:20:21,724 --> 00:20:24,770
Oh I almost forgot,
your wife was crying the other night.

368
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,015
Keep a eye of her
for post-natal depression,

369
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:27,782
it's pretty serious.

370
00:20:28,077 --> 00:20:31,165
She hasn't seem sad at all,
but I'll keep an eye on her.

371
00:20:31,953 --> 00:20:34,267
<i>Of course no matter
how many mysteries you solve,</i>

372
00:20:34,892 --> 00:20:36,587
<i>it's always easy to miss one.</i>

373
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,955
Turk I can't handle going home right now.

374
00:20:41,024 --> 00:20:43,137
Don't look at me, I wasn't crying.

375
00:20:44,585 --> 00:20:46,167
I just need a break from the baby.

376
00:20:50,343 --> 00:20:52,154
<i>Like who's really in trouble.</i>
