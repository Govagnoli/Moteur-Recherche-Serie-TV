1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,400
Kylie wanted to take things slowly. So, 17 dates in,

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,460
I was basically embroiled in the world's longest make-out session.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,120
Too much kissing?

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,180
No, no. Come on, I still have a little saliva left.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,870
As I felt the onslaught of what can only be described as a vicious tongue cramp,

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,000
I decided it was time to let Kylie see my favorite dance.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,710
The "For God's sake, invite me to stay over" dance. And we all know where that ends.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,490
The dance begins with a subtle hint.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,430
I am so pooped.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,940
Step 2: Sashay her into sympathy.

11
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,630
It's chilly out there.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,400
It is cold.

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,740
Finally, sweep her off her feet with your vulnerable cuteness.

14
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,540
You know what I call this weather?

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,280
Snuggle weather.

16
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,280
Tip the band leader and fluff up the pillows, because this dance is done.

17
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,570
You should go.

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,430
Yeah, hit the bricks, bitch. You got no game.

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,620
I wasn't the only one having relationship trouble.

20
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,080
Lately, Turk and Carla had lost their sizzle.

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,660
And as a couple, when you reach a roadblock, you can do one of 2 things.

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,090
Look inward and try and solve your problems together or blame someone else.

23
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,210
You have to move out.

24
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,240
What?

25
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,660
Is this about the bra catapult thing? Because if it's that big a deal,

26
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,970
I can throw my own water balloons.I don't need those c-cups.

27
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,810
J.D., we're newlyweds. That's hard enough and when you're around...

28
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,810
Tell him, Turk.

29
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,210
You're all up in our space!

30
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,340
What?

31
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,470
When have I ever been all up in your space?

32
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,970
This is nice.

33
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,370
Sorry about the twosie, guys.

34
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,680
And here I thought that was a lovely evening.

35
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,080
Well, we're all adults here, so I guess I'll...

36
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,920
just bid you guys adieu and gather my things quietly, starting with my cable box.

40
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,850
Guys, guys, guys. You've all been working here for 2 years.

41
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,850
Now why do I have to keep teaching you the same stuff?

42
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,630
I want to see you apply light pressure in small circles.

43
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,320
Can we take a break? The sun is scorching, and I'm very fair-skinned.

44
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,810
You've only been out here for 8 minutes.

45
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,490
Whatever.

46
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,690
Ah, the intern car wash.

47
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,230
Are you saving up so you can finally get those pec implants replaced?

48
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,680
Ron is coming to town today.

49
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,910
Speaking of which, I need to see you put on something a bit nicer.

50
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:03,190
You know, this whole competition thing that you have happening with your high school buddy,

51
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,210
it is very, very boring.

52
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,920
You know, like you were the homecoming king, he was the prom king.

53
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,920
You went to medical school, he went to business school.

54
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,710
You got divorced, he got divorced.

55
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,650
Yeah, but he never has to see his wife anymore,

56
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,800
so technically he's got me beat on that one.

57
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,390
Look, I am not going to let this weekend become about who's a bigger man.

58
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,120
Ron's bringing his kid, I can't wait to meet the child.

59
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,550
And when he pulls in here in his crappy rent-a-car...

60
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,020
and he gets one look at my hand-polished Porsche,

61
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,540
well, naturally, I'll have the lead.

62
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,870
Very exciting.

63
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:52,100
Whoo-hoo! Hey. Hey, guys. I know the chopper seems like a bit much, but...

64
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,120
there was crazy traffic, so I'm having my assistant drive my rental car over from the airport.

65
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,850
Well, it hardly seems worth it now, but what the hell?

66
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,010
So, Per., what are you driving these days?

67
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,110
Well, that ol' girl needs a wash.

68
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,480
Thank you, Ron.

69
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,850
I can't believe Turk and Carla are kicking me out.

70
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,450
When I was 15, my parents threatened to do the same thing, so I called them on it.

71
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,420
They let you stay?

72
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,790
Nope. I lived with the Babcocks for 2 years.

73
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,820
I didn't have a lot of rules though because they were really old and they thought I was a ghost.

74
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,840
All right, Carla calls the shots. Appeal to her rational side.

75
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,790
Carla... I totally understand you guys need your space,

76
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,260
but with work and my financial situation,

77
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,350
finding a new place is gonna be minimum, 2 to 4 years.

78
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,940
Come on, Bambi. Aren't there any other married couples...

79
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,480
that want to live in a small apartment with a 29-year-old man?

80
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,320
She called me a man.

81
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,990
Ok, time to play the best friend card.

82
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,500
Turk, I've always had your back and you always had mine.

83
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,960
Are you sure you want to go through with this?

84
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,380
- It was my idea.
- I banged your first girlfriend.

85
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,630
Chantal?

86
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,410
Now, look, I need a favor.

87
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,570
Let me try it, I'll move out for a week.

88
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,570
If you still like it, I'll move out for good.

89
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,820
-Agreed.
-Agreed

90
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,630
All right.

91
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,880
And don't worry about John Dorian...

92
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,050
because I may be poor in pocket, but I'm rich in friends.

93
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,110
Elliot, I need to crash at your place for a week.

94
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:14,810
Nope.

95
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,080
That's ok, because when God closes a window, he opens a door.

96
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,490
I'm just not sure I'm comfortable with you sleeping here.

97
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,870
Kylie, I hear you. But trust me, this week is not gonna be about sex.

98
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,390
Even though I think we both agree that's where we'd eventually like our relationship to end up, right?

99
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,390
So what do you say?

100
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,310
It's good to see you, buddy.

101
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,770
It is great to see you, I'll tell you that.

102
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,550
Looks like we got ourselves in a little walk and hug here.

103
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,550
-What say we...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

104
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,180
So look at you, Mr. Big Time doctor.

105
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,890
How about you, Mr. Big time...

106
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,210
I don't actually know what you do.

107
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,670
I've told you 100 times.

108
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:01,050
I run mergers and acquisitions for a large private equity hedge fund.

109
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,440
-You've forgotten already, haven't you?
-No, you do hedge clippings for a big farm.

110
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,900
You privately acquire hedgehogs.

111
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,920
Oh, come on, you got a hog farm. Give me a break.

112
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,930
Tell me this, how's that super sexy mother of yours?

113
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,720
You know what, your crush on my mom was cute when we were 14,

114
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,720
but the woman's 85 now.
You need to back off.

115
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,430
Or you can ask her out to dinner.

116
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,530
I'll have her pop in her "going out" teeth and you two can see if there's any real spark.

117
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,450
Jordan.

118
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,330
Hi.

119
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,990
Will you be joining us for dinner?

120
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:27,980
No way.

121
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,040
Every time we go out, the whole night turns into a giant pissing contest.

122
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,580
No, it doesn't.

123
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,000
First one who tags the dog, wins.

124
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:39,920
Count it.

125
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,400
I've seen that dog around the neighrhood.

126
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,020
I think we killed its spirit.

127
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,050
-Yeah.
-Look.

128
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,140
Why don't you bring Nathan over to our place tonight?

129
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,270
The kids can play, and we can forget all about this competition crap.

130
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,640
-I'd like that.
-So would I.

131
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,860
Jack is going to kick Nathan's ass at playing.

132
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,200
How great is it not having J.D. around, huh?

133
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,280
So great.

134
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,580
So great.

135
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,890
Now what?

136
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,370
Well, let's see.

137
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,370
Did it on the couch.

138
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,190
-Did it in the kitchen.
-Oh, yes.  We did.

139
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,670
Want to do it on J.D.'S bed?

140
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,790
I think it's about time someone did.

141
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,220
You don't really want to have more sex, do you?

142
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,360
God no, I didn't even want to do it in the kitchen.

143
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,600
Well,

144
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,380
what do we do now?

145
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,250
Whenever J.D. and I are bored, we like to play a little game called "toe or finger."

146
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,200
You close your eyes,

147
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,390
and I run either a toe or finger underneath your nose and try to guess which one it is, huh?

148
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,120
Fine. What do you want to do?

149
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,510
Usually when J.D. gets off work, we gossip about hospital stuff.

150
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,740
Baby, that sounds a little immature.

151
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,520
Ok! Then, you know, what the hell are we supposed to do?

152
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,570
Hi, guys.

153
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,360
Thanks for inviting me over.

154
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,830
Thanks for letting us crash here, man.

155
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,700
The Todd's not accustomed to receiving gentleman callers.

156
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,270
Ok.

157
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,650
Oh, cool picture. Which one of those guys is you?

158
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,380
Oh, I don't swim.

159
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,310
So there's only one rule if you're gonna stay at "el casa de Todd".

160
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,120
You got to hammock up.

161
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,020
Oh, I don't have one of those, Todd.

162
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,160
No problem.

163
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,060
What are you, about a medium?

164
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,280
Extra-medium.

165
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,450
This will work.

166
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,310
And it'll look good, too.

167
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,940
All right, Jack, listen to me.

168
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,580
Ron's in the bathroom diapering his kid.

169
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,860
When he gets out, it's playtime.

170
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,770
And, son, lately your coloring's been sloppy and your Elmo song... well,

171
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,540
unfortunately, it's lacked heart. Now you and I, we both know that your...

172
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,410
super-secret go-to toy are your building blocks.

173
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,050
Well, it's time to shine, Jackie Cox. It is time to shine.

174
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,770
Earn daddy's love on 3.

175
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,470
1, 2, 3, earn daddy's love.

176
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,960
27 second diaper change.

177
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,480
I can change a diaper in 20 seconds.

178
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,610
Oh, my god.

179
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,470
Say, Ronnie, what say we let the kids play for a while?

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,420
They could probably play with, oh, I don't know,

181
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,980
how about the building blocks that Jack very, very rarely ever even touches?

182
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,620
You know, Nathan is actually in the 90th percentile in height.

183
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,350
Jack's only in the 85th.

184
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,650
Of course, he's in the 99th for head size.

185
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,790
Congratulations.

186
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,420
Your son's the hamburgler.

187
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,370
Head size is directly related to intelligence.

188
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,900
Really?

189
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,580
Jack, get the bucket off.

190
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,700
Oh! And Laverne told me that nurse Tisdale...

191
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,430
is sleeping with that married albino radiologist.

192
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,190
Oh, I feel so bad for his wife.

193
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,180
Elliot!

194
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,690
It's not about empathy, it's about judging people.

195
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,870
Can't we do something else?

196
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,750
Look, I already said I don't want to play that game, Turk.

197
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,750
Ok, you know what,

198
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,390
I vote Elliot goes home because she's all up in our space!

199
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,800
Honey, she's in our space.

200
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,080
Why? Because I don't want to dish about other people behind their backs...

201
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,380
or smell your toe?

202
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,750
Or finger.

203
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,120
All I've seen so far is the toe, Turk!

204
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,540
See you tomorrow, guys.

205
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,860
Look, Perry, we just have to accept Jack the way he is,

206
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,600
love him unconditionally, and enroll him in some sort of block-building class.

207
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,880
Look at these things, Jordan.

208
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,790
Yeah?

209
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,110
The color coordination, the... the symmetry.

210
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,070
A 2-year-old shouldn't be able to do this kind of stuff.

211
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,800
What are you trying to say?

212
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,590
They say just admitting there's a problem is half the battle...

213
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,410
even if it's something you didn't expect...

214
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,910
What is wrong with you guys?

215
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,170
We miss J.D.

216
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,630
The bottom line is, when the warning signs are right in front of you,

217
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,940
there's no denying the truth.

218
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,120
Nathan has classic signs of autism.

219
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,240
Ron's kid doesn't make eye contact, he barely speaks,

220
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,590
and he freaked out when you tried to cuddle him. I mean, hell,

221
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,910
if he was an adult, he'd be, well,

222
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,530
you know, me.

223
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,920
But those behaviors in a child could point towards autism.

224
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,070
I think it's pretty obvious what we have to do.

225
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,010
Grit our teeth, get through the weekend, never speak to Ron again?

226
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,350
Exactly.

227
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,620
I cannot believe what I just heard!

228
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,850
The ticktocking of your biological clock...

229
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,430
leading you towards the corner of celibate and spinster way?

230
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,180
Sometimes it's great to already have a bastard child.

231
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,180
You said it.

232
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,890
You know, it is our obligation as doctors to tell someone when there is a problem.

233
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,840
And I will bring a child into this world when I am good and ready,

234
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,790
not when society dictates I must.

235
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,390
Good god, you smell like baby.

236
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,230
I've only actually met the child once,

237
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:10,070
so I think it's pretty important that we figure out a way to spend some alone-time with him.

238
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,220
Perry, if I'm gonna be spending a lot of time with someone else's child,

239
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,970
it's gonna be with our neighbor's 17-year-old.

240
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,370
And don't think he hasn't asked.

241
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,720
Oh. Pablo.

242
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,500
Hello?

243
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,890
Anybody home?

244
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,890
J.D., we're right here.

245
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,220
Tell them you want to come back!

246
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,820
I just came by to get my toothbrush.

247
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,110
Carla took your toothbrush out the bathroom and put it in the hall closet.

248
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,290
Finger.

249
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,290
Bingo.

250
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,720
Come on, Rowdie.

251
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,370
We should ask him back.

252
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,620
Baby, no.

253
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,950
We're too proud.
We are the proud Turks.

254
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,390
Hey, guys, the heater's broken again.

255
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,220
What happened?

256
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,980
I clubbed it with a mag light.

257
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,450
I can probably stay and fix it. It could take 3, 4, 5 days.

258
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,520
I did a triple bypass yesterday. I think I could fix the heater.

259
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,770
Suit yourself.

260
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,150
Bye, trumpet player I don't know. Now I understand why your music is so sad.

261
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,800
So, I hear you're homeless.

262
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,180
I wanna volunteer, give you a place to stay.

263
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,050
I don't think so, buddy.

264
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,340
Listen, crash in my garage. I guarantee you there will not be another person in there.

265
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:38,140
You're gonna slather jam on my face and sic a family of raccoons on me, aren't you?

266
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,700
Damn it. I've become predictable.

267
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,760
I'm out.

268
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,930
Oh, yeah? Well, from what I hear I'm your last option.

269
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,040
Options?! I got cable TV and a dead dog. I got plenty of options.

270
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,780
Come on in. I've got a huge king bed.

271
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,710
It'll be nice to have a buffer between me and my mom.

272
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,500
Sorry, bro. We're a little crowded tonight.

273
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,240
Lonnie, you have 3 kids?

274
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,440
That I know of.

275
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,740
Yeah?

276
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,940
Does Doug Murphy live here?

277
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,380
-The pathologist?
-Yeah.

278
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,810
No. He moved out. Excuse me. I gotta go change somebody's life.

279
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,030
Ok...  but, Mr. Mcmahon, would you mind...

280
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,450
Hi-oh!

281
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,710
You are correct, sir!

282
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,790
So, why do you wanna baby-sit my kid? You think I can't handle my own kid?

283
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,090
No, that's not it at all. I think you're great with your kid.

284
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:37,110
You're fantastic with your kid. In fact... In fact, if you want, you can baby-sit my kid.

285
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,330
Are we really doing this?

286
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,720
'Cause I'll baby-sit the hell out of your kid.

287
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,500
-Oh, bring it on, daddy.
-Who needs a baby-sitter?

288
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,990
I'll do it! You don't even have to pay me in cash. Just pay me in hot showers.

289
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,890
And you don't have to, like, wash me, unless you want to,

290
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,250
but that could be weird. I don't know.

291
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,410
Newbie, I've got this one covered.

292
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:54,020
Come on, you two are interracial best buddies. I, too, have a black best friend.

293
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,360
Go out. Enjoy it. Celebrate your uniqueness. I can do it!

294
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm sorry. Did you just call me black?

295
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,310
Because the last time I checked, the correct term was african-american.

296
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,930
Well, Turk lets me call him brown bear.

297
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,230
Who the hell is Turk?!

298
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,400
I should go.

299
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,160
Angry black man.

300
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,370
It never disappoints.

301
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,840
I pull it out when I need to.

302
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,680
Well, what do you say?

303
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,090
Well, I do have a lot of work to get done.

304
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,210
You can watch Nate.

305
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,850
You got it.

306
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,670
Sometimes the worst thing is getting exactly what you want.

307
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,500
Nathan?

308
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,110
Look at me.

309
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,540
Nathan.

310
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:39,920
Damn it.

311
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,620
Baby?

312
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,890
Could you get me a towel so I could wipe this sweat from my head?

313
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,550
They're all dirty, ok? J.D. Used to wash them.

314
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,980
It's so hot!

315
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,110
When the hell is he gonna finish fixing the heater?!

316
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,990
It's ok. He's a professional. I'm sure he's almost done.

317
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,550
This...

318
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,700
should not have been removed.

319
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,860
Todd made you wear a banana hammock to bed?

320
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,320
It was horrible. I kept imagining I was an olympic diver.

321
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,260
Well,

322
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,760
it means a lot to me that you would go through all that just to respect my boundaries.

323
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,610
Thanks, Kylie. I can just sleep on the couch.

324
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,190
You don't have to crash on the couch.

325
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,280
Well, Dr. Dorian, are you gonna join me?

326
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,970
I couldn't have planned it better.

327
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,020
J.D.!

328
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,710
We're sorry. The door was unlocked, and we knew you'd be here.

329
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,710
We want you back.

330
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,700
I don't want to come home. It took me a month to get here from the couch.

331
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,460
Uh, J.D., maybe you should go home.

332
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,800
Get the moment back! Say something hot!

333
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,110
Perhaps we could invite Turk and Carla to join us on the bed.

334
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,980
I'll go.

335
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,700
I think it is so great that you're gonna talk to your friend.

336
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,920
And I know it's gonna be hard, so if you need me,

337
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,640
you just say the word, and I will jump right in.

338
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,490
I need to talk to you about Nathan.

339
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,730
That little guy's my life.

340
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,070
I've gotta go.

341
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,790
What's up?

342
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,600
Ron, there is no easy way to do this, so I'm just gonna go ahead and say it.

343
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,800
I think Nathan is autistic.

344
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:48,420
And that's the real reason that I wanted to spend time with him today.

345
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,700
This is...

346
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,180
this is unbelievable.

347
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,150
I know, but the good news here is that we found out early,

348
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,250
-...so you can be as proactive as you...
-No, no, no.

349
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,160
You are unbelievable. I mean...

350
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,580
you can't handle the fact that my kid is better than your kid at building blocks, so you...

351
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,750
tell me there's something wrong with him?!

352
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,310
You know what, uh...

353
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,790
why don't you just get the hell out of here, hmm?

354
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,730
That's just not gonna happen.

355
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,320
No way.

356
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,080
At first I was a little disappointed that I wasn't sleeping at Kylie's,

357
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,330
but it was good to be home.

358
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,610
I'm home!

359
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,060
Hello, fridge.

360
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,970
Good to see ya, lamp.

361
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,110
Here I come, couch!

362
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,220
You guys moved couch?

363
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,790
It's always nice to let your friends know that you appreciate them...

364
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,250
I'm glad you're home, buddy.

365
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,300
I missed you, my african-american friend.

366
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,260
Call me brown bear.

367
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,620
Brown bear.

368
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,230
This, uh...

369
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,490
is a classmate of mine from medical school.

370
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,330
He's located up in your area now.

371
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,270
I think he'd really be able to help you.

372
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,070
But sometimes you just can't quite find words to show that appreciation.

373
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,380
You know, uh...

374
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,460
I just wanna say that, uh,

375
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,510
I'm gonna handle this kid situation so much better than you ever could.

376
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,590
Oh, give me a break. I would kick your ass in situation-handling.

377
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,280
I'm a doctor, for god sakes.

378
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,500
And for the record,

379
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,590
the Vegas odds-makers are makin' Coxy a heavy favorite.

380
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,950
Well, then, I would just bet on me and make a bundle.

381
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,050
You know what?

382
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,330
I probably would, too.

383
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,710
Behold, the twinkie from the first day we moved in.

384
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,500
I owe you an apology, Turk.

385
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,020
-Splitsies?
-Of course.

386
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,970
Want some?

387
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:56,650
No.

388
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,020
Ok, fine. More for me.

389
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,180
So, Bambi,

390
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,240
what's the deal with all the things you do around here?

391
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,640
What do you mean?

392
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,420
The laundry, the fixing the radiator,

393
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,500
the listening to me gossip, and playing stupid games with Turk.

394
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,590
How do you make yourself do all that stuff?

395
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,190
At the end of the day, the best thing to do for your friends is to be honest.

396
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,080
I don't know. I never really thought about it.

397
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:22,400
I guess when you care about someone, you'll do whatever you can to make'em happy.

398
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,980
You know, it's funny.

399
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,910
You guys couldn't go one week alone with each other without needing J. Dizzle around.

400
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,160
What is up with that?

401
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,970
You just have to hope that your honesty doesn't make them realize...

402
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,330
something they didn't wanna know.

403
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,650
We're in trouble, aren't we?

404
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,380
Yeah.
