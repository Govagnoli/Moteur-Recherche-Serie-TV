1
00:00:01,052 --> 00:00:05,523
<i>In the last three days, I convinced Elliot to dump her
boyfriend and be with me, then told her I didn't love her.</i>

2
00:00:05,558 --> 00:00:09,919
<i>Still, we're good friends, so if I give her some space, eventually everything will be fine.</i>

3
00:00:09,954 --> 00:00:14,880
<i>Unfortunately, since Turk's whole family's in town
for his wedding, I'm staying in her apartment.</i>

4
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:17,251
We have to go.

5
00:00:18,575 --> 00:00:22,096
My lips are bleeding! Can you hand me a tissue?

6
00:00:23,408 --> 00:00:25,623
Hey, so what do you guys think? Extra groomsman?

7
00:00:28,652 --> 00:00:31,531
Don't worry, Rowdy. I'm marrying their sister.

8
00:00:31,566 --> 00:00:35,661
Hey! Baby! Check this out! You ain't
gonna believe what I did with Rowdy!

9
00:00:35,696 --> 00:00:38,162
Turk! You're not allowed to see me
on our wedding day, you idiot!

10
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:40,851
She's mulling it over.

11
00:00:40,886 --> 00:00:42,441
Oh, my God. I just figured it out.

12
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:48,663
This is one of those reality shows where our sister tries to
convince us that she's gonna marry some obnoxious--agh!

13
00:00:48,698 --> 00:00:52,260
We haven't really had a chance to talk yet. I'm Mama Turk.

14
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:53,789
Oh, hey. How ya doing?

15
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:55,528
Damn, that looks painful.

16
00:00:55,563 --> 00:00:58,672
Hey! I really want you guys to get along today!

17
00:00:58,707 --> 00:01:00,114
I hope you die.

18
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,021
Elliot!

19
00:01:01,056 --> 00:01:02,083
...After the wedding.

20
00:01:02,118 --> 00:01:03,030
Thank you!

21
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:05,416
Elliot. Help me wax my brow.

22
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:06,514
Okie-dokie.

23
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:10,195
"I do." And then it's classy kiss....

24
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:13,587
Or sexy kiss....

25
00:01:14,322 --> 00:01:16,523
Or slutty kiss....

26
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:19,970
That looks like fun. Can I help?

27
00:01:20,005 --> 00:01:22,169
Uh, help this.

28
00:01:22,204 --> 00:01:24,061
Elliot, maybe you should pay attention to what you're doing.

29
00:01:24,096 --> 00:01:25,048
Oh, really?

30
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:30,578
Uhmm.... How--how thin did you want those?

31
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:37,533
Turk and I have to go.

32
00:01:37,568 --> 00:01:39,884
<i>See, Turk and I had made a pact.</i>

33
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,700
<i>The day that one of us got married, we'd play a last round
of tennis-ball golf in the parking lot as single best friends.</i>

34
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,163
Look out, Tiger!

35
00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:50,527
That'll play.

36
00:01:50,562 --> 00:01:51,587
Hell yeah.

37
00:01:51,622 --> 00:01:54,391
<i>Oh, yeah, and the guy getting married has to caddie for the other guy naked.</i>

38
00:01:54,642 --> 00:01:55,675
Huh?

39
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:57,987
Ohhh....

40
00:01:58,022 --> 00:01:59,391
He'll be fine.

41
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:03,407
I can't believe you're actually gettin' married.

42
00:02:03,442 --> 00:02:04,734
Me neither, buddy.

43
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:07,272
Hey, where's the fuzzy cover for my one-wood?

44
00:02:07,307 --> 00:02:08,825
It's on my nine-wood.

45
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,257
Aw, dude! My mom made that!

46
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:13,806
Still, I'm happy for you, man.

47
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:15,780
Yeah, me too.

48
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,750
Oh, great. I think I'm getting a pimple.

49
00:02:37,265 --> 00:02:39,130
Is this noticeable?

50
00:02:40,723 --> 00:02:42,201
I'll ask someone else.

51
00:02:42,236 --> 00:02:44,699
Hide the bride! I found him!

52
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:47,806
Turk, we're heading over to St. John's.

53
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:49,473
Thought you guys were getting married at Holy Trinity?

54
00:02:49,508 --> 00:02:50,723
St. John's is cheaper.

55
00:02:50,758 --> 00:02:52,429
Oh, plus the priest there looks like Captain Sulu.

56
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,018
No, that's the priest at Trinity.

57
00:02:54,053 --> 00:02:56,221
Oh, baby, I wanted to be married by Sulu!

58
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:58,262
Turk, are you coming over with us now or not?

59
00:02:58,297 --> 00:03:01,445
If I work this shift, I can finagle two extra days on the honeymoon.

60
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,474
Ooh, nice use of "finagle."

61
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:03,195
Oh, thanks.

62
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,264
Look, I get outta here at 4, ceremony doesn't start until 5.

63
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,839
Worst case scenario, I'm a little late for the wedding.

64
00:03:08,874 --> 00:03:09,636
Do it!

65
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:10,924
Oh! Whoa!

66
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,300
Dude, you're dealing with a nervous bride, a woman I scorned,

67
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:15,894
and two sisters with three eyebrows.

68
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,259
See you at 5!

69
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:23,229
Hey, Elliot, how are you doing with this whole J.D. thing?

70
00:03:24,895 --> 00:03:28,307
I can't believe that on this day you would actually worry about how I'm doing.

71
00:03:29,254 --> 00:03:31,041
Carla, you're such an amazing friend.

72
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:32,101
Don't do this, Elliot.

73
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:35,359
promised myself I wouldn't get emotional until after we took the pictures.

74
00:03:35,394 --> 00:03:37,896
I just love you so much.

75
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:40,207
I love you too!

76
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:43,445
Even though I ripped off your sister's eyebrow?

77
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,643
That's okay.... You know,

78
00:03:45,678 --> 00:03:48,598
this morning she actually said she was gonna look better than me!?

79
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:51,135
Not anymore!

80
00:03:53,554 --> 00:03:56,052
Car-Carla, there is a man filming us.

81
00:03:56,087 --> 00:04:00,334
Oh, he's just doing our wedding video. Hi, Anthony.

82
00:04:00,369 --> 00:04:01,280
What's up, babe.

83
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,993
Oh, my God! You're actually getting married in a few hours!

84
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:07,569
I mean, everything's gonna be all different.

85
00:04:08,554 --> 00:04:11,320
Carla, you never have to have sex again
except for when you actually want to.

86
00:04:11,355 --> 00:04:12,419
I know!!!

87
00:04:14,997 --> 00:04:16,728
Erase that last part.

88
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,037
So, are you ready for your appendectomy?

89
00:04:22,072 --> 00:04:24,499
Hey, what do you do with an appendix after you've removed it?

90
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:26,090
We make finger puppets.

91
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:31,099
Ha! Don't mind Dr. Turk, here. He's just overly
excited because he's getting married this afternoon.

92
00:04:31,134 --> 00:04:35,000
I, on the other hand, am the only person in the hospital not to be invited.

93
00:04:35,796 --> 00:04:39,281
Dr. Miller, look, it's a really small wedding, and you're an amazing boss,

94
00:04:39,316 --> 00:04:43,826
and I feel really bad about it, so...there's a wedding brunch tomorrow,

95
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:49,017
and it's only for family and really close friends,
and...well, we'd love for you to be there.

96
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:51,213
That would mean the world to me!

97
00:04:51,248 --> 00:04:54,434
Okay, I didn't think you were gonna say yes. There's no brunch.

98
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,115
That's gonna cost me.

99
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:02,139
Jordan, get outta bed. We got a wedding to go to.

100
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:08,085
Perry.... Jack is at my mom's, the apartment is empty....

101
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:14,148
It's just you and me.... Let's take a nap! We'll sleep through the ceremony,

102
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:15,396
and then go to the reception.

103
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:17,488
Can we at least have sex?

104
00:05:17,523 --> 00:05:20,675
Do what you have to. Don't wake me.

105
00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:29,908
"(Bum-bum-bum) Hava nagila, hava nagila, hava na--"

106
00:05:29,945 --> 00:05:31,043
Ted! Church!

107
00:05:31,078 --> 00:05:33,354
We do mostly Bar Mitzvahs.

108
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:35,210
Hey, J.Z.

109
00:05:35,245 --> 00:05:35,930
Holla.

110
00:05:35,965 --> 00:05:38,052
For some reason, this woman wants you to usher her.

111
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,324
Danni, what are you doing here?

112
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:42,220
We RSVP'd when we were still dating.

113
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:44,417
You can't just crash my best friend's wedding!

114
00:05:44,452 --> 00:05:45,969
I'll go halvsies on the gift.

115
00:05:46,004 --> 00:05:47,030
Right this way, please.

116
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:48,357
"Bum-bum-bum."

117
00:05:48,392 --> 00:05:52,109
"Hava nagila, hava nagila, hava nagila..."

118
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:55,288
Dude, that pick-up line you gave me for all the Spanish chicks is not working.

119
00:05:55,323 --> 00:05:56,842
Maybe you're saying it wrong. Let's hear it.

120
00:05:56,877 --> 00:06:01,577
Yo tengo herpes genital...para ti.
[I have genital herpes...for you.]

121
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:04,193
Nope. That's right. Keep trying.

122
00:06:05,978 --> 00:06:09,730
Mucho herpes! ...Grande! Oh, yeah!
[Many herpes! ...Big!!]

123
00:06:09,765 --> 00:06:13,517
I'll have to agree with Chet. Turk, Carla, you guys are awesome!

124
00:06:13,552 --> 00:06:16,661
This is...an awesome wedding, and I'm having an awesome time,

125
00:06:16,696 --> 00:06:18,594
and you two are gonna have an awesome life!

126
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,414
Hi.

127
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:21,511
Awesome!

128
00:06:21,546 --> 00:06:22,723
Hold my gum?

129
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:30,886
Gimme that appendix! Let's close this guy up, and I'm outta here!

130
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:33,235
Wait. Look at his lesions on his peritoneum.

131
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,748
Oh, no.

132
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:37,970
Dr. Turk...what do you think we should do?

133
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:40,246
Leave a post-it in there for the next guy?

134
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:41,001
Try again.

135
00:06:41,036 --> 00:06:44,411
Perform an exploratory laparotomy. I NEED A PHONE!

136
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:51,419
Everybody! We're gonna get started soon, so if
everyone could please turn off your cell phones?

137
00:06:58,147 --> 00:07:00,720
Go for the Todd. ... Turk, Turk, Turk, Turk.

138
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:02,576
I can't talk right now! I'm at your wedding.

139
00:07:02,611 --> 00:07:04,016
Todd! Gimme that!

140
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:08,021
Carla, it's Turk.

141
00:07:08,056 --> 00:07:10,023
Hello?

142
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:12,790
Where're the other bridesmaids?

143
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:14,570
They're out buying an eyebrow.

144
00:07:14,605 --> 00:07:16,806
Well, that's gonna be tough on a Saturday,

145
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,699
with Eyebrows Eyebrows Eyebrows being closed.

146
00:07:18,734 --> 00:07:20,783
They're gonna have to go all the way across town to the Eyebrow Hut.

147
00:07:24,006 --> 00:07:26,087
Look, Elliot, just tell me what you want me to do and I'll do it.

148
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:29,119
Go back three days and keep me from throwing away my life for you.

149
00:07:31,988 --> 00:07:34,843
<i>In that second, I knew how to make things right if I just had the time.</i>

150
00:07:34,878 --> 00:07:37,001
What do you mean you're gonna be late?

151
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:38,404
Sweet!

152
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,843
What did you say?

153
00:07:39,878 --> 00:07:40,830
Nothing, girl!

154
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:42,084
What?

155
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:44,200
Wedding wishes?

156
00:07:44,235 --> 00:07:46,441
Oh, hey, kids....

157
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:49,012
I just wanna wish you two all the luck in the world because,

158
00:07:49,047 --> 00:07:52,384
you see, the key to marriage is...work.

159
00:07:58,935 --> 00:08:01,131
Ted! Do I look ready?

160
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,041
Sorry.

161
00:08:02,076 --> 00:08:04,087
Everybody, sit down! Cover your eyes!

162
00:08:05,754 --> 00:08:11,171
Um, Turk, uh, got held up in surgery, but if you just hold on for a few minutes,

163
00:08:11,206 --> 00:08:13,331
everything will be perfect. 'Kay.

164
00:08:13,366 --> 00:08:15,793
Don't look! I'll be back in a minute!

165
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,164
I knew that jackass would screw this up!

166
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,739
Did you just dis my friend, Turk?

167
00:08:21,774 --> 00:08:23,370
What are you gonna do about it, meathead?

168
00:08:23,405 --> 00:08:26,666
My friend, I am about to make you look very silly!

169
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:32,050
Things are starting to heat up.

170
00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:35,664
<i>I wonder how Sean took it when Elliot dumped him?</i>

171
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:39,718
You wouldn't happen to know if Sean Kelly lives here, would you?

172
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:44,302
Hey, J.D. Thanks for the buck.

173
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,215
Oh, hey, honey. Are you waking up?

174
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,110
Why are you in such a hurry?

175
00:08:56,145 --> 00:08:58,726
I'm not in any kind a hurry!

176
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:04,154
Did you dress me?

177
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:07,109
Fine. Carla scares me, okay?

178
00:09:07,144 --> 00:09:09,763
She may be small, but she has very powerful legs.

179
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:12,261
Listen, princess, when we get to the reception,

180
00:09:12,296 --> 00:09:16,353
you will just say what a beautiful ceremony it was, and it will be peachy.

181
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:18,903
Trust me! We're not missing anything!

182
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:21,172
Hey, babe. Got any wedding wishes?

183
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:24,498
Hi, Carla! Hi, Turk! This is the greatest wedding ever!
YES!

184
00:09:24,524 --> 00:09:27,650
I'm having so much fun. And there are a lot of really cute boys here!
Hey, what are you doing? She's with me!

185
00:09:27,685 --> 00:09:31,773
I mean, I'm just having so much fun.
These guys, they kiss really, really good.

186
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:33,971
And I like everyone's clothes and, like, what they're wearing.

187
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,623
And I know that _____, you know, things didn't really work out and

188
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:39,349
but, you know, we're still kinda friends.

189
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,876
Ted! I will kill you!

190
00:09:45,911 --> 00:09:47,391
Won't happen again.

191
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:48,794
You know the drill, people!

192
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:54,411
Look, Miss Espinosa, unfortunately there's another wedding scheduled

193
00:09:54,446 --> 00:09:55,698
Don't go there, Padre. He'll be here.

194
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,424
Please?

195
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:03,076
Go. I can finish from here.

196
00:10:03,111 --> 00:10:04,366
Thank you.

197
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:10,157
So, Sean.... You look...woolly.

198
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,808
Since Elliot left me, my life's fallen apart.

199
00:10:12,843 --> 00:10:17,849
It's been four days, Sean. Which, by the way,
makes the beard all the more impressive.

200
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,590
I'm a quarter Hungarian.

201
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,347
Ah.

202
00:10:20,382 --> 00:10:21,710
What do you want, J.D.?

203
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:26,218
I didn't steal Elliot from you, man! She just
panicked 'cause you guys were moving in together!

204
00:10:26,253 --> 00:10:27,545
I don't know, J.D....

205
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,066
Sean, if you have any guts at all, you will show up at this wedding,

206
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:34,931
take her into your...hairy arms, and tell her you want her back!

207
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:39,467
You should...probably shower first.

208
00:10:41,696 --> 00:10:43,241
I can't believe he's not here yet!

209
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:44,756
Don't worry! I made it!

210
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,595
I don't care about you, you idiot!

211
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,885
They had premarital sex.

212
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,114
Miss Espinosa, if your fiance' is not here in the next
thirty seconds, I'm gonna have to pull the plug.

213
00:10:55,553 --> 00:10:56,432
Do you ever miss the ladies?

214
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:57,604
A little.

215
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,474
I would, too.

216
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,332
Are you close yet?

217
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:04,970
Yeah, I'm here! Start it up, and I'll meet you at the altar!

218
00:11:13,468 --> 00:11:15,045
It's for real this time, people!

219
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:35,004
Carla!

220
00:11:40,611 --> 00:11:42,498
Can I help you, young man?

221
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:44,317
Mr. Sulu?

222
00:11:44,352 --> 00:11:46,211
No, son.

223
00:11:49,573 --> 00:11:53,734
Hey. Baby, look, I got mixed up. Is there still time if I race over there?

224
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:55,136
No.

225
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:09,019
Hey, baby! How's the party?

226
00:12:12,187 --> 00:12:15,231
I'll just stand here and be quiet for a little while.

227
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:17,562
Just a club soda, please. I'm driving.

228
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:18,683
It's an open bar, cutie.

229
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:20,458
Give me a bucket of scotch.

230
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,651
Sport, take these and keep moving.

231
00:12:24,686 --> 00:12:28,424
<i>There she is! Do something charming.</i>

232
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:30,912
Elliot, check it out. Kelso gave me his car keys.

233
00:12:31,671 --> 00:12:35,005
Ow! What are you doing?!

234
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,126
I'm--I'm just trying to think of ways to make things right!

235
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:42,429
Well, you can cross off keys in the face!
Honestly, J.D., there's nothing you can do.

236
00:12:42,964 --> 00:12:44,172
Hey, Elliot.

237
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,741
I'm sorry, I get excited.

238
00:12:54,412 --> 00:12:57,524
What do you mean, disaster? Honey, this is an amazing wedding!

239
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:01,012
And I know what you're gonna say -- we didn't actually get married.

240
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:04,230
But you know what? Tonight, you and I, we're gonna rip it up.

241
00:13:04,265 --> 00:13:06,124
And then we're gonna hop on a plane to the Bahamas,

242
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:09,987
where you and I can get married tomorrow amongst 
the fishes and mermaids and whatnot.

243
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,678
Turk, for the last time, mermaids aren't real!

244
00:13:12,713 --> 00:13:14,041
I know what I saw!

245
00:13:15,405 --> 00:13:16,428
Why isn't the band playing?

246
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:21,543
In a word? Shrimps. Nasty, one-day-old shrimp.

247
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:25,682
The band got into 'em while we was waiting
at the church for your sorry ass.

248
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:28,106
Girl, you are wearing that dress.

249
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:34,357
No music. I swear, Turk, I am this close to losing it!

250
00:13:34,392 --> 00:13:36,062
Carla?

251
00:13:36,097 --> 00:13:37,463
It's okay.

252
00:13:37,498 --> 00:13:41,858
I-I just wanted to say that that was one of the
most beautiful ceremonies that I've ever seen.

253
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,979
Oh, boy.

254
00:13:43,014 --> 00:13:47,124
You think that's funny? Why would you wanna hurt me?

255
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:50,384
Shame on you!

256
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,187
So, open bar?

257
00:13:54,222 --> 00:13:55,212
Mm-hmm.

258
00:13:55,247 --> 00:13:58,658
Psst! Get out while you can!

259
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:01,622
I'm happy.

260
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:04,437
Happy wedding, nerd.

261
00:14:04,472 --> 00:14:05,686
Keep walking, dragon.

262
00:14:09,455 --> 00:14:10,249
Yagh!

263
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:11,539
How's it goin'?

264
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:13,925
You wore your janitor uniform to a wedding?

265
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,713
No, I wasn't invited to the wedding. I just work here on weekends.

266
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:20,180
Who's that?

267
00:14:20,215 --> 00:14:21,241
My date.

268
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,713
Forks! Frannie! Forks! Forks!

269
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:27,304
Are forks where the big money is?

270
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:28,478
Forks and ladles.

271
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:31,339
So, what have you been up to?

272
00:14:31,374 --> 00:14:33,990
Doctor stuff. Heh. You?

273
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:37,973
Oh, I--I was crying a lot. And then I got really emotionally numb.

274
00:14:38,008 --> 00:14:42,931
Um, oh, and this morning, I jammed a salad fork two
inches into my thigh to see if I could still feel the pain.

275
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,294
And?

276
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:45,242
Oh, yeah.

277
00:14:45,277 --> 00:14:46,077
Good.

278
00:14:46,112 --> 00:14:48,309
Elliot, do you wanna get out of here?

279
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:51,956
Sean, look, I don't know what J.D. told you, but...

280
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,002
if we're gonna give this another try,

281
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:57,764
you need to know that I didn't end things with you
because I was freaking out about us living together.

282
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:04,683
I did it because...J.D. and I have this history and...
I actually thought he might be the one.

283
00:15:04,718 --> 00:15:07,654
But I just ended up getting my heart broken.

284
00:15:08,794 --> 00:15:10,310
Sucks, doesn't it?

285
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:13,148
Yeah.

286
00:15:16,006 --> 00:15:17,229
Carla?

287
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:22,406
I apologize. I am a horse's ass.

288
00:15:25,337 --> 00:15:28,633
It's not you. It's everything!

289
00:15:28,668 --> 00:15:33,330
Ever since I was a little girl, I had this fairy-tale idea of the perfect wedding.

290
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:36,018
And, oh yeah, I always ended up married! Pff!

291
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:39,163
Come on, marriage is overrated.

292
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:41,777
Jordan and I aren't married, and we're getting along great.

293
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:45,792
Uh, Perr, is making out with a stranger cheating?

294
00:15:45,827 --> 00:15:48,709
Technically not if it's under ten seconds, dear.

295
00:15:48,744 --> 00:15:49,961
Ah, not worth it.

296
00:15:52,514 --> 00:15:57,211
Look, you and Turk were meant to be together. It's fate and you know it.

297
00:15:58,653 --> 00:15:59,601
Thank you.

298
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,612
I shouldn't be drinking.

299
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:15,358
I know. I know.

300
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,753
Okay, Carla's dying, it's rally time.

301
00:16:21,788 --> 00:16:25,293
We have no band, we have no DJ. You're my best man -- brainstorm.

302
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:28,679
Remember that after-party we had in college,

303
00:16:28,714 --> 00:16:31,747
when the stereo went out and I ended up hooking
up with that grad student from Brazil?

304
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:32,542
Yeah?

305
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:33,907
That was awesome.

306
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:36,640
Woo hoo, you made out with a little person.

307
00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:38,340
I thought she was kneeling.

308
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:42,242
Ted! Can you play a little music for us, buddy?

309
00:16:42,277 --> 00:16:45,425
It's gonna cost you double what you paid us for the church.

310
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,939
Here's twenty.

311
00:16:46,974 --> 00:16:54,780
Aaaand, here's four back. So, mind if we start with some TuPac?

312
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:55,618
Kick it.

313
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:57,547
All riiiight!

314
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:05,502
So, uh...so call me if you ever wanna get drunk and have sex.

315
00:17:06,752 --> 00:17:07,700
Bye, Sean.

316
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,103
Bye.

317
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:10,617
Can I have a ride home?

318
00:17:10,652 --> 00:17:13,383
Uh, well...sure.

319
00:17:15,473 --> 00:17:17,101
Oh! Okay!

320
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,073
You can't let him drive her home! She says "thank you" the naughty way!

321
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:26,240
J.D.! It's not happening. Besides, if Sean and I are meant to be together,

322
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:29,196
I never would have gone home with you that night
and sabotaged everything that I had with him.

323
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,460
You and I are gonna be okay, right?

324
00:17:34,057 --> 00:17:35,271
What do you think?

325
00:17:37,092 --> 00:17:38,228
Probably not.

326
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:41,692
Elliot!

327
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,696
You let me know when we are.

328
00:17:44,492 --> 00:17:45,705
Don't hold your breath.

329
00:17:55,768 --> 00:17:59,261
Ahhh! Dr. Turkleton!

330
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:01,950
Actually, sir, it's Turk.

331
00:18:01,985 --> 00:18:03,578
That's your first name.

332
00:18:03,613 --> 00:18:06,685
You think my name is Turk Turkleton?

333
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:16,231
And Mrs. Turkleton! The Turkletons! Can I get a scotch?

334
00:18:16,266 --> 00:18:17,328
Hey, baby.

335
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:20,254
I'm so sorry I messed everything up, baby.

336
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:25,256
Don't be. Let's dance.

337
00:18:27,424 --> 00:18:28,901
Set me up, Ted.

338
00:18:28,936 --> 00:18:35,643
Um, hi. We haven't used instruments in a long time,

339
00:18:35,678 --> 00:18:40,569
so bear with us if we're a little rusty.... One, two, three.

340
00:19:39,368 --> 00:19:43,066
<i>I guess, in the end, things seldom work out exactly the way you expect.</i>

341
00:19:45,471 --> 00:19:47,365
Turk, our plane leaves in an hour.

342
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,957
I know, I just gotta check on my patient, baby.

343
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,225
Hey. How's it going, Mr. Fitzpatrick?

344
00:19:56,963 --> 00:20:00,257
Actually, it's Father Fitzpatrick.

345
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:02,378
Could you do us a quick favor?

346
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:03,786
Mm-hmm.

347
00:20:03,821 --> 00:20:07,227
<i>Other times, well, you've kind of sealed your own fate.</i>

348
00:20:14,723 --> 00:20:18,254
<i>Either way, you have to trust that whatever's supposed to happen, will happen.</i>

349
00:20:25,244 --> 00:20:29,084
<i>Besides, somehow you always seem to end up with the person you're meant to be with.</i>

350
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,682
One, two, three.

351
00:20:35,107 --> 00:20:36,867
Thanks for helping out.

352
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,836
I'm only going as far as the dumpster.
