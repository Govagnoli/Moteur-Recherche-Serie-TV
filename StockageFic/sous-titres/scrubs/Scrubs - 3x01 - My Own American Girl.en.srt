1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,554
Before I go into that
building and start my day,

2
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:08,374
I always like to take a quiet
moment to prepare myself.

3
00:00:12,757 --> 00:00:16,304
Well I guess it would be nice
if I could touch your body

4
00:00:16,885 --> 00:00:17,483
...not you, sir...

5
00:00:17,942 --> 00:00:21,184
I know not everybody
has got a body like you

6
00:00:23,845 --> 00:00:26,095
Dude, what's the rule about
white boys dancing in public?

7
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:28,047
Not allowed unless you're gay.

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,605
Morning, Steven

9
00:00:38,142 --> 00:00:40,754
Fine. Then I'll just put on
something that rocks!

10
00:00:55,224 --> 00:00:58,750
As a third-year resident, you know everyone
so well you can practically speak for them.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,822
For instance...

12
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:02,564
Remember: No more dancing.

13
00:01:03,134 --> 00:01:04,118
Pow!

14
00:01:04,714 --> 00:01:06,620
Good morning, Bambi.
Sign this, please?

15
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:10,746
Who you eyeballing, tough guy?

16
00:01:11,426 --> 00:01:12,226
And of course...

17
00:01:12,668 --> 00:01:15,596
Well, Zsa Zsa. Now you've put
me in quite the pickle. You see

18
00:01:15,965 --> 00:01:18,993
with those earphones on,
you can't hear me, but!

19
00:01:19,526 --> 00:01:22,400
The odds are highly against you cracking
open that yapper and annoying me today.

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,683
So, what to do? What to do?
What to do? Ahh, hell...

21
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,831
Stop addressing me as "Dr. Cox"
in front of your patients.

22
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,492
When they find out my actual name,
they tend to page me with questions

23
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:37,764
when they realize just exactly
how inept you really are. Oh, and as

24
00:01:38,237 --> 00:01:41,306
an added safety measure,
from now on, I'll only be responding

25
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:45,607
to "Doc," "Doctor," "Ceasar,"
or "The Big Cheese;" and noooo,

26
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:51,691
I'm _not_ joking. Not _now_ - not ever.

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,416
See, things never really
change around here.

28
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,220
...Surgical and Medical still play
each other in basketball.

29
00:02:02,563 --> 00:02:06,435
I'm gonna toast you so bad, your
momma ain't even gonna recognize you!

30
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:09,908
Yeah? Well I heard that your
sister started drinking again!

31
00:02:12,037 --> 00:02:14,216
I'm still not great at smack-talk.

32
00:02:15,528 --> 00:02:17,136
So, it's not supposed to be true?

33
00:02:19,886 --> 00:02:22,255
No. Ohhh, let it pour, big guy.

34
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,503
And Elliot was still searching for
something to turn things around for her.

35
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,992
Oh, my God! Isn't she beautiful!
I mean, this car

36
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:31,786
has totally maxed out my credit,
but my self-esteem's been so low lately

37
00:02:31,787 --> 00:02:34,226
that I think it's worth it.
Don't you?

38
00:02:34,726 --> 00:02:37,447
I just deliver the cars.
She's all yours.

39
00:02:41,803 --> 00:02:42,646
Frick!

40
00:02:44,178 --> 00:02:48,778
But really, the only difference is that by the
third year, nothing catches you by surprise.

41
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:53,241
Mrs. Farr is still having
acute abdominal pain.

42
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:55,538
So, what's wrong
with me, doctor?

43
00:02:56,024 --> 00:02:59,413
Oh, good Lord, I have no idea.
Okay, don't panic, just do

44
00:02:59,414 --> 00:03:03,000
what all doctors do in this
situation and fake a page.

45
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,819
Uh-oh. Got a Code 3 down the hall.

46
00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:07,087
What's that?

47
00:03:07,193 --> 00:03:09,587
Uhhh, Code 3? Not as bad as a
Code 4, but a hell of a lot worse

48
00:03:09,588 --> 00:03:10,816
than a Code 2.

49
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:15,000
_That's_ a Code 2.

50
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:20,540
SCRUBS 3x01
MY AMERICAN GIRL

Transcripts : Michelle V.L. M.
Subtitles by McFly - ronaldosbruder@gmx.de

52
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:32,800
Ahh, I cannot figure out what's
wrong with Mrs. Farr. I gotta go ask Cox.

53
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:34,724
Why won't you ask me?

54
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:36,785
You're a surgeon - you just cut people up,
you don't actually know anything.

55
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:37,805
Oh, yeah.

56
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:41,694
Dr Cox ! Dr Cox...

57
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:45,459
Big Cheese.

58
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,289
Yes?

59
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:50,292
If you're wondering why Dr.
Kelso's nose is squeaking...

60
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:53,248
...about a week ago,
he was torturing Elliot...

61
00:03:54,093 --> 00:03:55,856
...and Dr. Cox, well....

62
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,800
Needless to say,
there were consequences.

63
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,267
Perry, great news:
I managed to swing it so

64
00:04:04,268 --> 00:04:08,824
that you get to go over to the state pen
today and do the annual inmates' physicals!

65
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:11,049
Well, hell's bells, Bobbo,
if you want to fire me,

66
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,545
just do it!

67
00:04:12,745 --> 00:04:15,613
I would, but even though this
room was quite crowded when

68
00:04:15,614 --> 00:04:18,495
you sucker-punched me,
apparently nobody saw it happen.

69
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,670
Uh, so what happened, sir?

70
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:28,714
So, Dr. Cox, can you, uh,
look at her chart?

71
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:32,827
Newbie, did you not see what
just happened? Kelso is so

72
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:35,695
far up my ass that I can taste
Brylcreem in the back of my throat.

73
00:04:35,695 --> 00:04:38,299
And you, you're...
you're third-year now.

74
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,975
Wake up, this whole Dr. Cox
riding in to The Rescue part of the show

75
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:42,895
is _over_.

76
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,149
Oh, you're on your own.

77
00:04:49,448 --> 00:04:52,800
Elliot's unlucky streak continued with
the head of the radiology department.

78
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:55,931
Dr. Moyer. Uh, you told me my
patient had colitis, and it turns out

79
00:04:55,932 --> 00:04:57,665
it was just traveler's diarrhea?

80
00:04:57,926 --> 00:04:59,389
So? Sounds like good news.

81
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,611
Yeah.... He took it as bad news,
maybe 'cause of the unnecessary

82
00:05:03,612 --> 00:05:06,162
colonoscope I shoved
three feet up his pooper?

83
00:05:06,903 --> 00:05:08,100
What do you want me to do?

84
00:05:08,898 --> 00:05:13,752
Uh, apologize to my patient and tell
him it was your mistake, no big deal?

85
00:05:14,383 --> 00:05:18,328
Think I'm gonna pass on that one.
See, I got you pegged as one of those

86
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:21,756
spineless types that's not gonna cause
me any trouble no matter what I do.

87
00:05:21,857 --> 00:05:23,369
So, thanks for stopping by

88
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,510
and don't forget your car door.

89
00:05:26,152 --> 00:05:27,847
I just didn't want it to get stolen, okay?

90
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,082
That was me not caring.

91
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:43,064
What?

92
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,563
Now that we can always
hear Dr. Kelso coming,

93
00:05:46,564 --> 00:05:48,894
some people have
modified their work habits.

94
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:54,378
So, you're engaged
to that surgeon guy?

95
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:55,340
Mm-hmm.

96
00:05:55,575 --> 00:05:56,572
Is it serious?

97
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:58,280
No, Ted. We swing.

98
00:06:00,413 --> 00:06:01,538
Squeaky's a-comin'!

99
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,965
Oh, hey, Bob-cat!
Listen, I was hoping

100
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:25,668
that maybe you could get someone
to cover for me out at the prison tonight.

101
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:29,958
I know that the very idea of you doing
a favor for me makes those ass cheeks

102
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:32,887
clench up so tight that you could
shovea lump of coal up there

103
00:06:32,888 --> 00:06:35,372
and probably crap out a diamond! Right?

104
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,308
Ohh.... Come on, Bob, I can't
even remember the last time

105
00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:42,617
I saw my son, and you - you - you're
a father, for God's sake,

106
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,650
you understand, don't you?

107
00:06:44,846 --> 00:06:48,137
My son was recently kicked
out of his Hari Krishna sect

108
00:06:48,138 --> 00:06:53,046
for being too much of a hippie, and is currently
residing in the Portland subway system.

109
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:56,159
The point, Perry, is that the only thing
I care less about than my son...

110
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,605
... is your son.
Have fun at the Big House.

111
00:07:02,963 --> 00:07:07,441
Hey. You guys know that unbelievably
handsome new anesthesiologist?

112
00:07:07,587 --> 00:07:08,584
Yes... ...No...

113
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:09,395
No.

114
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:11,797
Well, he didn't know
I was engaged, so he

115
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:12,891
asked me out to a movie tonight.

116
00:07:13,072 --> 00:07:15,342
Well, if he's paying, give a
brother some Snow Caps!

117
00:07:15,964 --> 00:07:17,920
Turk, why don't
you ever get jealous?

118
00:07:18,558 --> 00:07:21,731
Woman, look at me! How can
someone with all of this here

119
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,012
be jealous of any of that out there!

120
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:27,003
You know what I realized when I
was dragging my car door around?

121
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:31,024
I cannot remember the last good thing
that happened to me at this place. I mean,

122
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:32,958
what is it about me that makes
everybody walk all over me?

123
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,917
No self-confidence.

124
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:34,914
You could be a baby sometimes.

125
00:07:34,915 --> 00:07:36,483
Your voice gets really
high when you're upset.

126
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,506
Rhetorical question, okay?

127
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:41,087
Now I'm getting smoothies.
Who wants one?

128
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:42,500
Peach Fizzle-Vizzle?
I'll have a Razz-ma-Tazz?

129
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:43,845
Orange Goo Goo.

130
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:44,483
Got it.

131
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,773
Mrs. Farr. You know what?
The only way I'm gonna figure out

132
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:52,869
what's wrong with this woman
is start running tests for everything.

133
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,448
Good luck, Bambi. Look at the time.

134
00:07:54,762 --> 00:07:57,554
In a hospital, you can never
try to get anything done

135
00:07:57,555 --> 00:07:59,599
Friday after 5 P.M. Because anyone

136
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,484
who can actually help you
is out of here like a gunshot.

137
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:08,665
Hello? Anyone?

138
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:15,825
Have a good weekend, Steven.

139
00:08:20,662 --> 00:08:21,562
Sean?

140
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,364
Hey, Elliot! How you -
- how you doing?

141
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:25,547
You look great!

142
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,257
Except, the buzz-cut has kind of
tapped into this recurring dream I have

143
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,010
where my dad makes me marry this
army colonel named Johnny Case who,

144
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,146
as it turns out, already has
a wife in the Philippines.

145
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,047
Anyways, she and I become friends,

146
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,750
but then she smothers him with her
thighs and then frames me for it.

147
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,100
Well, yeah, I'm - I'm doing
about the same, too.

148
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:45,113
I thought you hated this place
'cause of that time you -

149
00:08:45,114 --> 00:08:46,476
- you got sick here?

150
00:08:46,635 --> 00:08:47,557
You remember that?

151
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:50,335
Y-you got sick on my face....

152
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,688
Oh, no, that wasn't the smoothies -
you just said you thought you were

153
00:08:53,689 --> 00:08:56,272
falling in love with me, and sometimes
when I get really uncomfortable I hurl.

154
00:08:56,273 --> 00:08:59,251
I know, I get -
I get a little, uh...gassy.

155
00:09:00,046 --> 00:09:03,708
Look, Sean, this is gonna
sound weird, but - this is fate!

156
00:09:04,006 --> 00:09:06,202
I mean, things have just been so bleak
for me lately, and I've been waiting

157
00:09:06,203 --> 00:09:10,043
for something - someone - to come
along, you know? And...here you are.

158
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:12,337
The one that got away!

159
00:09:13,438 --> 00:09:15,038
That means something, right?

160
00:09:15,442 --> 00:09:16,573
Yeah, I think it, uh....

161
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,996
Hello!

162
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:19,269
Hey. Hi. Oh!

163
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:23,110
No, no, no, no!
It's okay. It's ok - it's....

164
00:09:23,944 --> 00:09:25,754
That girl is extra-strength crazy.

165
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,977
I don't know, I mean, she's a
doctor, she's gotta have it

166
00:09:27,978 --> 00:09:29,209
a little bit together, right?

167
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:36,148
Elliot, your smoothies
are on your car.

168
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:47,452
Double frick!

169
00:09:49,876 --> 00:09:51,923
I was trying to keep things
positive with Mrs. Farr.

170
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:53,865
I don't think you'll be having
breakfast with us tomorrow.

171
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:55,044
Why, am I going home tonight?

172
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:56,467
No, the cook died.

173
00:09:56,955 --> 00:09:58,418
What the hell am I gonna do?

174
00:09:58,619 --> 00:09:59,619
Hey.

175
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:04,177
She wanted to come back and help.
And I wasn't gonna let my baby

176
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:08,302
be here all alone with all sorts of guys
eyeballing her privates and whatnot.

177
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,719
If you can't muster up some sincere
jealousy, don't even bother.

178
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:16,307
I got everyone's smoothies. They
were out of Orange Goo Goo.

179
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:19,287
How can we help, Bambi?

180
00:10:19,936 --> 00:10:21,510
Okay, if we're ever gonna figure out
what's wrong with that lady,

181
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:23,140
we need to get a whole
bunch of tests done.

182
00:10:23,787 --> 00:10:25,481
There's nothing wrong with
needing your friends

183
00:10:25,482 --> 00:10:28,671
to take care of someone... It's better
than missing out on your family

184
00:10:28,672 --> 00:10:31,009
because you're stuck
making new friends...

185
00:10:32,186 --> 00:10:34,337
That's, uh, that's my son.

186
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:37,987
He's adorable. Can I keep it?

187
00:10:38,324 --> 00:10:41,534
No, no you - you
certainly may not!

188
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,591
Bad man.

189
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,594
Still, even that's
not the worst....

190
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,982
'Kay, I'll get the x-ray, you two go
work on the echo-cardiogram, and then

191
00:10:52,983 --> 00:10:55,943
all three of us will meet back here and
deal with the abdominal CAT-scan, okay?

192
00:10:55,944 --> 00:10:56,744
Got'cha.
- Mm-hmm.

193
00:10:57,753 --> 00:10:59,254
Well, what can I do?
- We got it, Elliot.

194
00:10:59,596 --> 00:11:02,444
Being such a mess that your
friends don't even ask for your help?

195
00:11:02,926 --> 00:11:04,667
That's the bottom of the barrel.

196
00:11:15,003 --> 00:11:17,950
Sometimes in life, all there is to do
is ponder your own shortcomings

197
00:11:17,951 --> 00:11:21,714
by cannon-balling four straight
32-ounce, protein-enhanced smoothies.

198
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,688
You'll be okay, Marshmallow.

199
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:30,236
Laverne, do you call me "Marshmallow"
because I'm soft and easily flattened?

200
00:11:30,743 --> 00:11:34,374
Well, yeah.... But, if it makes you feel
any better, it's also because you're

201
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:35,890
_very_ white.

202
00:11:39,404 --> 00:11:41,087
Where the hell's Ted?

203
00:11:44,174 --> 00:11:46,967
Hundred and nine is my record.

204
00:11:49,723 --> 00:11:51,795
Da-amn!

205
00:11:52,815 --> 00:11:55,433
Look, I know you're the only
x-ray tech on tonight, all right?

206
00:11:55,434 --> 00:11:57,335
But I just need a quick
abdominal scan to make sure

207
00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:58,557
Mrs. Farr doesn't
have an obstruction.

208
00:11:58,558 --> 00:11:59,458
Uh-uh-uh!

209
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:01,835
Don't want to know who they are!
Don't want to know how they're doing!

210
00:12:01,836 --> 00:12:03,634
Just wanna go "click-click!"
and get 'em out of here!

211
00:12:04,235 --> 00:12:06,778
Now, your lady's about forty
people down on the list.

212
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:09,175
And as always, uh,
there are no cutsies.

213
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:10,576
Damn!

214
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:14,149
Look, uhh.... There's gotta
be something I can do.

215
00:12:16,297 --> 00:12:18,750
See, because of the way I laid
on top of you, I can tell people

216
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:21,544
this is an x-ray of Siamese twins!
How cool is that!

217
00:12:21,555 --> 00:12:24,294
It's so cool, Laddy, let's never
talk to anyone about it, ever!

218
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,228
I don't understand how you think
you can get this cardiologist

219
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:29,697
to do an echo-cardiogram for us.

220
00:12:29,996 --> 00:12:32,056
I've worked in the Cath. Lab before -
- I understand how these guys think.

221
00:12:32,387 --> 00:12:34,217
Plus I had a one-nighter
with him a long time ago.

222
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:38,227
Okay! Oh-ho-ho! You're telling me
this guy in here got tasty treats?

223
00:12:38,228 --> 00:12:40,418
Turk! I worked here eight years
before you showed up -

224
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:41,534
- I had sexual needs.

225
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,854
Okay, first of all, that's disgusting.

226
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,277
Are you jealous?

227
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:46,978
Nahhh...

228
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:49,103
Ahhh, so you don't mind
if I go in there alone.

229
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:52,851
Thank you.

230
00:12:58,674 --> 00:13:00,883
So, Mitchell, I guess I
was just hoping that

231
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:03,010
you would help us out
with this patient, Mrs. Farr.

232
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:07,089
Carla, love to, really,
but, uh, it's already six

233
00:13:07,188 --> 00:13:08,748
and it's my son's birthday tonight.

234
00:13:09,117 --> 00:13:09,865
How old is he?

235
00:13:10,108 --> 00:13:10,621
He's ten.

236
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,864
And how long ago was that
night that you told me

237
00:13:12,865 --> 00:13:14,990
you were single and
you took me dancing...?

238
00:13:15,655 --> 00:13:17,600
Eight years. I'll see you
in the patient's room.

239
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:27,715
All taken care of.

240
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:29,230
How is that funny?

241
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:32,303
Don't you love the outfit?

242
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:34,946
You know, I always wanted to
be the father of a tiny gay sailor.

243
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:38,600
Jordan, come on, we agreed that we
would wait until he's quite a bit older

244
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,599
before we started
systematically ruining his life, right?

245
00:13:44,085 --> 00:13:44,985
...Right?

246
00:13:45,036 --> 00:13:46,997
I may have painted his
toenails for funsies.

247
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,546
Dr. Cox, I managed to get
some tests done on Mrs. Farr....

248
00:13:52,894 --> 00:13:55,958
Look, Gwyneth, you're old
enough now to hear this from me:

249
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,764
Every time I go out of my
way to help you children

250
00:13:58,821 --> 00:14:03,000
I get nothing but trouble. Now this
is the first five-minute window

251
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:07,266
I've had in the last week to be
with my son. And I'm just not gonna

252
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:09,761
have you pirouetting around in here
while my heart is breaking inside.

253
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,462
Sorry.

254
00:14:15,174 --> 00:14:20,835
Your heart is breaking inside?
That is so embarrassing for you!

255
00:14:21,074 --> 00:14:22,557
Thank you for that.

256
00:14:27,705 --> 00:14:29,109
What are you doing in here!?

257
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,710
It's...the men's room.

258
00:14:32,106 --> 00:14:35,448
I know! I mean, it's not like I
thought those were some kind

259
00:14:35,546 --> 00:14:39,748
of new female urinals, and then
...tried them, and found them

260
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:41,664
...oddly comfortable...

261
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:45,406
I'm just gonna replace these,
uh, urinal cakes, and then,

262
00:14:45,554 --> 00:14:46,633
uh, I'll go.

263
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:49,229
Why can't I just grow up?

264
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,430
Why can't I be stronger?

265
00:14:53,107 --> 00:14:56,125
Janitor? Have you ever
looked at yourself and wished

266
00:14:56,289 --> 00:14:58,094
that you were different
in every single way?

267
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:03,706
No... I'm a winner. But, I
will tell you something

268
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,698
that my grandmother
told me when I was a kid

269
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,079
even though at the time I
though she was my mother.

270
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:13,381
She said: "Time spent
wishing - is time wasted."

271
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:17,666
Now, she died shortly
after that, and my sister - who

272
00:15:17,926 --> 00:15:20,434
actually _was_ my mother
- she never got over it.

273
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:24,635
Neither did my brother-dad.
But the point is this:

274
00:15:24,994 --> 00:15:28,772
If you want to be different,
then be different!

275
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:30,463
Thank you.

276
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,118
Well, we're all under
one roof here,

277
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,844
we gotta watch out for
each other, right? Come on!

278
00:15:36,483 --> 00:15:37,324
There he is.

279
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:42,715
Watch out.

280
00:15:45,008 --> 00:15:47,796
Unfortunately, that's when
we ran into a brick wall.

281
00:15:48,222 --> 00:15:51,916
I'm head of the radiology department.
You call me in from home to do

282
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:54,750
an abdominal CAT-scan that could wait
until Monday morning? Well, guess what?

283
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:55,902
It's not happening.

284
00:15:56,703 --> 00:15:57,500
Look, Dr. Moyer-

285
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,090
THESE ARE MY MACHINES!

286
00:15:59,354 --> 00:15:59,811
Sir-

287
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:00,706
MY MACHINES!

288
00:16:01,473 --> 00:16:02,009
Whose machines?

289
00:16:02,298 --> 00:16:03,386
MY MACHINES!

290
00:16:03,926 --> 00:16:04,771
How is that helpful?

291
00:16:05,055 --> 00:16:06,415
THEY'RE MINE! MINE! MY MACHINES! MY
MACHINES! MY MACHINES!! MY MACHINES!!!--

292
00:16:06,744 --> 00:16:07,782
MY MACHINES !...

293
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,908
Oh, so you're going to sock me again.
Good God, Perry, at a certain point

294
00:16:19,023 --> 00:16:20,480
you're just beating
up an old man.

295
00:16:20,728 --> 00:16:22,310
Relax. I'm just
fixing your nose.

296
00:16:24,788 --> 00:16:27,397
Now, I'm real sorry I
cold-cocked you, there, Bob -

297
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:31,213
I shouldn't have done that. Even
if it did actually feel so damn good

298
00:16:31,214 --> 00:16:33,399
I changed my
pants afterwards.

299
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,979
But, still, I'm starting
to think it would be smart

300
00:16:37,192 --> 00:16:40,496
if you and I were to bury the hatchet.
What do you say, there, Bob?

301
00:16:42,445 --> 00:16:44,286
Come, on, handsome!

302
00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:51,247
Listen up, ace: You will always
be a royal pain in my ass,

303
00:16:51,376 --> 00:16:54,429
and I will always be waiting
for the day when I get to jam

304
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,689
that knife into your side once and for
all, and you know it as well as I do!

305
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,531
Much better, thanks!

306
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:05,639
You're welcome.

307
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:08,156
People don't change, Perry.

308
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,480
So you're just gonna roll over
and give up like you always do?

309
00:17:13,252 --> 00:17:15,992
Or are you finally gonna get
mad and do something about it?

310
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:23,863
MINE! MINE! MINE!
MINE! MINE!!!

311
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:28,405
Dr. Moyer, you're gonna give
Mrs. Farr the abdominal CAT-scan,

312
00:18:28,406 --> 00:18:31,796
and I'll tell you why: You remember
that colon patient of mine

313
00:18:31,797 --> 00:18:33,988
that you screwed up on?
Well I'm gonna tell him exactly

314
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:36,284
whose fault that was, and then I'm
gonna spend every waking second

315
00:18:36,285 --> 00:18:38,844
helping him figure out how to
physically and financially bitch-slap you,

316
00:18:38,936 --> 00:18:42,708
even if the end result is that we both
get our asses fired. Your move, chuckles.

317
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:44,000
Bring her down.

318
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:48,501
Elliot!
- Hell, yeah!

319
00:18:51,222 --> 00:18:52,100
Wow.

320
00:18:54,764 --> 00:18:58,025
It feels good to work as a team and gather
all the pieces of the puzzle together

321
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,253
so we can finally look Mrs.
Farr in the face and tell her...

322
00:19:01,254 --> 00:19:03,070
we still don't know
what the hell she has.

323
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,428
Dammit, why can't we figure
out what's wrong with this lady?

324
00:19:06,303 --> 00:19:08,189
All right, you guys. What
do you know so far?

325
00:19:08,546 --> 00:19:10,767
The echo ruled out
an aortic dissection.

326
00:19:11,277 --> 00:19:13,679
The abdominal CT would have
shown if it was biliary disease.

327
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,894
Think. What's her background?

328
00:19:16,397 --> 00:19:17,954
Persian Sephardic Jew.

329
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:20,798
Aw, come on, you guys, gimme
a break - you know this.

330
00:19:23,294 --> 00:19:24,986
Familial Mediterranean fever.

00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:26,988
Atta boy.

332
00:19:28,564 --> 00:19:30,548
I'm actually grateful
most things don't change.

333
00:19:37,758 --> 00:19:39,104
Hello, slackers!

334
00:19:40,754 --> 00:19:42,177
My paddle's stuck in me!

335
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:44,581
Not only is the status
quo good for work,

336
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,982
it's also somewhat comforting.

337
00:19:47,191 --> 00:19:50,222
Now, I would've never figured it out
unless you guys had done the leg work.

338
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,158
You four deserve all the credit, really.

339
00:19:54,131 --> 00:20:00,033
Mrs. Farr, Dr. Cox has saved
the day! Don't ya just love it?

340
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,600
Come here!

341
00:20:04,408 --> 00:20:07,615
And if something does change, more
often than not it just reminds you

342
00:20:07,731 --> 00:20:09,084
of feelings you've
had all along.

343
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:09,994
You look beautiful.

344
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:12,630
Like I said, once you hit the third year,

345
00:20:12,702 --> 00:20:13,907
there aren't a lot of surprises.

346
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,059
Hey, Elliot.

347
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,800
Hey!

348
00:20:19,692 --> 00:20:20,988
What are you doing here?

349
00:20:24,947 --> 00:20:25,719
Damn.
