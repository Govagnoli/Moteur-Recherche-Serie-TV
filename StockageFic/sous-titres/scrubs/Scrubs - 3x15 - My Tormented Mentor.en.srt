1
00:00:01,991 --> 00:00:05,292
It's been two weeks since Ben's death, and
even though he was Jordan's brother,

2
00:00:05,327 --> 00:00:07,988
Dr. Cox was having a much harder time with it than she was.

3
00:00:09,438 --> 00:00:12,494
Sweetie, are you gonna lie around on the couch all day again today?

4
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:13,956
What am I supposed to do?

5
00:00:13,991 --> 00:00:16,525
You know what might be fun? Cleaning yourself.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,708
I'd wash up, but I'm afraid to go in our bathroom.

7
00:00:18,743 --> 00:00:19,868
Why?

8
00:00:19,903 --> 00:00:22,777
<i>Jordan's best friends came to town for the funeral,</i>

9
00:00:22,812 --> 00:00:25,348
<i>and unfortunately for Dr. Cox, they still haven't left.</i>

10
00:00:25,383 --> 00:00:27,973
Since Perry won't stop using the loo without lifting the seat,

11
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:29,371
I've started to use his sink.

12
00:00:29,406 --> 00:00:31,451
Aren't you a little dolled up for the movies?

13
00:00:31,486 --> 00:00:34,479
If little miss co-dependent here doesn't get "shagged" every two days,

14
00:00:34,514 --> 00:00:35,762
she gets the shakes.

15
00:00:35,797 --> 00:00:37,208
It's true. Look.

16
00:00:37,243 --> 00:00:39,589
'Course, that could be 'cause you're sober for a change.

17
00:00:39,624 --> 00:00:41,063
Maybe!

18
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:42,577
Mmm!

19
00:00:42,612 --> 00:00:47,442
You silly. Are you still mad because we tried 
to fix Jordan up with someone yesterday?

20
00:00:48,977 --> 00:00:50,102
Scary!

21
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:51,651
Oh, God.

22
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:55,850
<i>Dr. Kelso was having a little female trouble of his own.</i>

23
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:59,329
Dr. Kelso, the sexual harassment around here has gotten out of control.

24
00:00:59,364 --> 00:01:02,394
Yesterday somebody asked Laverne if her boobs were made for walking!

25
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,434
It's rude! ...And it makes no sense.

26
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:06,552
Paris and Nikki were not amused.

27
00:01:06,587 --> 00:01:08,140
You named your breasts after the Hilton sisters?

28
00:01:08,175 --> 00:01:09,764
Other way around, sugar!

29
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:16,169
Ladies, this hospital's policy on sexual harassment is well-established. 
Plus--

30
00:01:16,204 --> 00:01:19,383
I'll handle this. I think what Garfunkle here is trying to say is

31
00:01:19,418 --> 00:01:20,895
that you should all take a second,

32
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,203
think seriously about what's really bothering you,

33
00:01:23,238 --> 00:01:25,744
and then have a big group unbunching of your panties.

34
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,920
Every time Turk's in a hurry, I'm always 
tempted to jump out and scare him.

35
00:01:31,955 --> 00:01:33,959
Well, today's the day!

36
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:35,813
Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga!

37
00:01:35,848 --> 00:01:36,909
Wooo! Ack!

38
00:01:36,944 --> 00:01:39,367
<i>The...reason Turk's in such a rush is because</i>

39
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:42,771
<i>he's starting a rotation with the hospital's new attending surgeon.</i>

40
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:56,551
So.... You guys my new residents?

41
00:01:56,586 --> 00:01:59,084
<i>I could tell what the guys were thinking.</i>

42
00:02:01,014 --> 00:02:06,140
Oh! There's so much blood! I hope it doesn't get on my dress!

43
00:02:13,808 --> 00:02:16,722
I'm Dr. Miller. A few quick things: Don't talk while I'm talking,

44
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:18,236
never utter the phrase "It's Miller time",

45
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,390
and I don't like the smell of cologne in my operating room.

46
00:02:20,425 --> 00:02:22,999
Now, I'd like to take a minute to listen to any questions

47
00:02:23,034 --> 00:02:24,435
or comments that any of you might have,

48
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,008
and then after this minute I never want to hear from any of you

49
00:02:27,043 --> 00:02:28,367
ever, ever, ever again. Anyone?

50
00:02:28,402 --> 00:02:31,556
Uh...I'm allergic to shellfish...?

51
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:34,012
Any other allergies? No? Great!

52
00:02:34,047 --> 00:02:37,059
You, and unibrow, go scrub up.

53
00:02:37,493 --> 00:02:39,356
What?

54
00:02:39,398 --> 00:02:41,309
My waxer's in the Bahamas.

55
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:42,823
Get a new one!

56
00:02:58,286 --> 00:03:02,134
Okay, why don't you show the girls around 
while I'm in my board meeting.

57
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:03,951
Love to. Newbie? I've got a job for you.

58
00:03:03,986 --> 00:03:05,916
No, no. No pawning them off on Radar.

59
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:06,861
They want the big-boy tour.

60
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:09,886
Hey, I've been sharing a guest room with razor-knees,

61
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:11,324
here, for the last two weeks.

62
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:12,421
Do you have a queen bed?

63
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:15,218
Well, it would be "queen" if I took my "cwothes" off it.

64
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:18,811
Ooh, he's quick. What's he like in the sack?

65
00:03:18,846 --> 00:03:19,650
Quicker.

66
00:03:19,685 --> 00:03:20,369
Oh.

67
00:03:20,404 --> 00:03:21,395
May I be excused?

68
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,602
You move, you die!

69
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:25,628
Be nice to my friends. Bye.

70
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,347
Bye.

71
00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:26,912
Bye.

72
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:28,056
Okay! Here's the tour:

73
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:31,384
This is where the patients enter, upstairs is where they go to die,

74
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,850
and down in the basement is where we slide their cold, 

75
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:36,986
, dead bodies into the wall. Oh, and that's the gift shop.

76
00:03:38,387 --> 00:03:39,975
Where can one get a nice gin and tonic?

77
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,941
You know, down the street on the right,

78
00:03:41,976 --> 00:03:44,285
they'll make an appletini that'll knock your socks off.

79
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,319
Right! Let's go and get drunk before pilates!

80
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:53,188
So, uh, Jordan seems to be doing pretty well.

81
00:03:53,223 --> 00:03:55,229
You know Jordan, she is a rock.

82
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,233
How 'bout you? How you holding up?

83
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:03,108
I...I know it's been kind of tough with Ben dying.

84
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:07,726
Are you gonna talk ever?

85
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:10,722
Let me go ahead and tee this up for you, there, Annika:

86
00:04:10,757 --> 00:04:14,239
We are all going to die someday.

87
00:04:14,274 --> 00:04:16,053
For the lucky few of us it'll be nice and fast.

88
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:20,487
But for most of us it'll be just as long and slow 
and painful as a conversation with you.

89
00:04:20,522 --> 00:04:23,170
That's a beautiful sentiment.

90
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:27,201
Hot Doc, 3 o'clock!

91
00:04:27,236 --> 00:04:29,169
I mean 5 o'clock!

92
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:30,766
Over there!

93
00:04:31,674 --> 00:04:33,981
Todd. Todd, let's get off on the right foot.

94
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:38,631
Hey! It might just be 'cause my expectations are low,

95
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,580
but you guys did not suck in surgery yesterday.

96
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,698
Well, as long as your expectations are low,

97
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:45,182
maybe we should have sex!

98
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:46,617
Perfect.

99
00:04:46,652 --> 00:04:48,207
I'm concerned about you.

100
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:50,664
I think you hold us women responsible for the fact that

101
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,026
your mommy didn't pay attention to you,

102
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:53,196
and if you don't get help,

103
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:55,503
you'll eventually start picking up prostitutes and killing them.

104
00:04:55,538 --> 00:04:58,227
I've always wanted to say that to him!

105
00:04:58,262 --> 00:05:00,873
Welp, now you don't have to! Ha-ha-ha!

106
00:05:02,483 --> 00:05:03,943
She just talked to me like I'm an idiot.

107
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:05,796
Hot chick, 12 o'clock.

108
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:08,565
Wow.

109
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,443
I know.

110
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:12,277
Nurse Espinosa, it's been brought to my attention

111
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,623
that there's been some inappropriate behavior lately.

112
00:05:14,658 --> 00:05:17,043
I know. I brought it to your attention.

113
00:05:17,078 --> 00:05:20,068
Anyway, it occurred to me that we can't allow this to continue.

114
00:05:20,103 --> 00:05:24,301
It occurred to you because I researched case studies

115
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:30,389
detailing the hospital's liability instead of going to 
single's night at the Korean church by my house!

116
00:05:30,424 --> 00:05:35,381
Ted's sad life aside, I have decided that you are 
going to run a sexual harassment seminar.

117
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,650
No one's gonna show up for that!

118
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:41,320
It isn't optional. Anyone gets more than three complaints here in the box

119
00:05:41,355 --> 00:05:43,698
then they have to attend.

120
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:47,332
Teddy, we missed you last night.

121
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:49,295
Shut up.

122
00:05:51,345 --> 00:05:53,653
What? He's baitin' me.

123
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:02,592
Seriously, how are you?

124
00:06:02,627 --> 00:06:07,508
Oh, my God. Look, Abby, I didn't write to you asking for help.

125
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:10,835
So, if you continue on down this road, you're going to end up eating,

126
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,756
breathing, and relieving yourself through a tube of some kind.

127
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,402
Signed, Dealing With It On His Own in Kansas.

128
00:06:16,437 --> 00:06:20,939
I wrote Dear Abby once in seventh grade 'cause 
I didn't have body hair like the other guys?

129
00:06:20,974 --> 00:06:23,396
By the time her response came out in Parade magazine,

130
00:06:23,431 --> 00:06:26,913
it was like a forest down there. Well, you know, "nothing ventured..."

131
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:31,691
Looking for streamers and a--and a marching band,

132
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:34,298
because this will be the ceremonial one-millionth time

133
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,415
I've had to shake off something that you've said.

134
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:41,294
Ahh. Yes, Newbie, I'm having a tough day.

135
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:42,618
And of course I'd love to head home,

136
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:45,114
but Jordan's satanic brood has taken over my apartment

137
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:48,629
and no man in his right mind would dare enter that place.

138
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:53,399
<i>Hmmm.... I should probably go to his place....</i>

139
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:56,272
Agility exercises?

140
00:06:56,307 --> 00:07:01,074
No. I'm air-fondling Dr. Miller's boobies. Who's with me?

141
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:02,738
No? Eh.

142
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:06,821
Why don't you lay off Dr. Miller? And don't say "I'd like to lay on Dr. Miller."

143
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:09,393
High-five later for reading my mind!

144
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,586
You know, I don't think you're stupid, Todd.... 

145
00:07:11,621 --> 00:07:14,686
Even though you're washing your hands with your gloves already on.

146
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:16,577
Dammit!

147
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:18,317
But keep your mouth shut, okay?

148
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:20,887
It's hard for Dr. Miller being a female surgeon around here.

149
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:24,252
All right. All those who are assisting me today, step forward.

150
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:28,188
Uh-uh, not so fast, beer-bong. You're out.

151
00:07:31,422 --> 00:07:33,228
Hello? The door was open--

152
00:07:33,263 --> 00:07:36,857
Oh, God! I'm sorry! I'm very sorry!

153
00:07:36,892 --> 00:07:39,166
I just came to--to tell you both that I-I think it would be better

154
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:41,130
for Dr. Cox emotionally if-

155
00:07:41,165 --> 00:07:43,664
if you two would--would leave. Okay? Thank you.

156
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:44,921
Just a second, darling.

157
00:07:44,956 --> 00:07:46,516
Uhhh, um.

158
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:49,806
Of course, we will leave, but before we go,

159
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:51,960
Allie could really use a man's opinion.

160
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:54,192
Does this bra make my boobs look real?

161
00:07:54,227 --> 00:07:55,408
Ohh, yes.

162
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:56,470
Damn. Let's switch.

163
00:07:56,505 --> 00:07:58,285
No, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no switchies.

164
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,241
I think we should all be happy with the bras God gave us! I really should go.

165
00:08:03,276 --> 00:08:05,015
Oh, it's all right. We were going to go to the gym,

166
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,178
but I could just as easily throw up instead.

167
00:08:07,213 --> 00:08:09,259
Or you could just give us a work-out right here.

168
00:08:09,294 --> 00:08:10,280
Uhh....

169
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:13,039
 I guess I could hang for a smidge.

170
00:08:13,074 --> 00:08:16,223
Good. 'Cause we've got something to tell you. Right, Allie?

171
00:08:16,258 --> 00:08:18,832
How dare you tell us to leave our best friend's house

172
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:20,761
because you want to kiss Perry's ass.

173
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:30,192
You know...ladies...I'm not usually into the rough stuff, but.... Oooooh.

174
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:33,415
 You shall not feast on me!

175
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,043
 I'm bored with this.

176
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:35,876
So am I.

177
00:08:39,657 --> 00:08:43,764
Thirty four, thirty five, thirty six.... Todd,

178
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,373
you have thirty seven complaints of sexual harassment!

179
00:08:50,857 --> 00:08:55,092
See! It's working! Well, good luck with the seminar.

180
00:08:55,127 --> 00:08:58,307
Oh! Dr. Kelso, you have five.

181
00:08:58,342 --> 00:09:00,801
Oh, I know! I put those in myself to prove a point.

182
00:09:00,836 --> 00:09:03,790
If you'll notice, all the "Kelso"s are written with a lower-case "K".

183
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:04,585
No, they're not.

184
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,604
Well, it was worth a shot.

185
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:10,180
There must be some loophole for me.... Where's Ted?

186
00:09:11,786 --> 00:09:14,272
Great service by Reverend Kim today, huh!

187
00:09:14,307 --> 00:09:18,203
So, you ladies doing anything after?

188
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:21,366
'Cause I'm not.

189
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,914
There's no music in my O.R., Hammer.

190
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:39,951
First of all, Hammer dance like this:

191
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:43,998
Uh-oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Hammertime!

192
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:46,228
Second, I got your back, so why don't you cut me a little slack?

193
00:09:46,263 --> 00:09:47,362
You have my back?

194
00:09:47,397 --> 00:09:50,086
Anybody gives you any trouble, and I'll handle the guy.

195
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:52,694
'Cause, uh, little ol' me can't.

196
00:09:52,729 --> 00:09:54,547
Well, I didn't mean it that way.

197
00:09:54,582 --> 00:09:58,525
 You know what's worse than the basic knuckle-dragging 
scalpel jocks I usually work with?

198
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,777
You. You are the worst kind of sexist.

199
00:10:01,812 --> 00:10:04,689
You're one of the sneaky ones who prides 
himself on saying all the right things when,

200
00:10:04,724 --> 00:10:09,002
deep down, what you really think is that I'm 
just a little girl who needs protecting.

201
00:10:09,037 --> 00:10:12,969
Now I would appreciate it if you would apologize.

202
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:16,675
<i>Sometimes it seems like men and women speak a completely different language.</i>

203
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:20,955
Okay. I think you all know why you're here.

204
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,149
Player! Check it!

205
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:25,757
Great stuff.

206
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:31,903
<i>And when that happens, even the best of intentions can be misunderstood.</i>

207
00:10:31,938 --> 00:10:34,469
What the hell is he doing here?

208
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:37,041
Perry's little whipping boy told us to leave town.

209
00:10:37,076 --> 00:10:38,591
Huh.

210
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:39,916
Oh, God.

211
00:10:39,951 --> 00:10:43,845
<i>And misunderstandings, well, they can lead to disaster.</i>

212
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,325
Dr. Turk? I asked you to apologize.

213
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,745
I have nothing to apologize for.

214
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,240
Then get out of my O.R.

215
00:10:53,412 --> 00:10:58,104
Awww.... Are you gonna cry like a little boy?

216
00:11:00,753 --> 00:11:01,679
See how I flipped it?

217
00:11:08,286 --> 00:11:11,864
Dr. Miller accused me of being sexist. Me! I'm marrying Carla

218
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:12,999
who do you think wears the pants?

219
00:11:13,034 --> 00:11:18,027
And the shirts...and the shoes...and sometimes my underwear.

220
00:11:18,062 --> 00:11:18,972
Really?

221
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:19,995
I said nothing.

222
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,301
Mr. Roberts likes to wear my brassieres.

223
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:23,548
Hm?

224
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,061
Elliot, this woman doesn't like me.

225
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:28,047
It could keep me from becoming the youngest chief of surgery in history,

226
00:11:28,082 --> 00:11:29,710
which could keep me from curing paralysis,

227
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:32,474
which could keep me from having my birthday be a national holiday!

228
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:34,853
And everyone knows I hate to work on my birthday!

229
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:38,521
May I ask you something, there, Judy?

230
00:11:38,556 --> 00:11:41,659
Do you have any idea what it's like to have three angry,

231
00:11:41,694 --> 00:11:45,478
under-fed women tear you several new ones for a full hour?

232
00:11:45,513 --> 00:11:47,822
Actually, yes. I caught the matinee of that show;

233
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:49,153
definitely not for the whole family.

234
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:53,918
Then for the last time, don't stick any part 
of your hairless body into my business.

235
00:11:53,953 --> 00:11:56,905
Trust me, there is nothing for you to gain from it.

236
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,643
Because even if you went on a cruise to the most remote

237
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:01,442
regions of the ocean and rescued my drowning,

238
00:12:01,477 --> 00:12:04,655
salt-soaked body in time to pump the sea water out of my lungs

239
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,961
and bring me back from the brink of death,

240
00:12:06,996 --> 00:12:10,668
I would STILL be upset that the first face I saw was yours!

241
00:12:10,703 --> 00:12:13,466
Well, you wouldn't see my face because it would be buried in your chest,

242
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:16,265
giving you the hug you've been afraid to ask for your whole life!

243
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,134
Huh!

244
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:22,123
Now, if you don't want my help, then fine, I'll back off.... 
But only because I feel a little bit guilty.

245
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,757
About what?

246
00:12:26,102 --> 00:12:26,707
Uh?

247
00:12:26,742 --> 00:12:32,340
Dr. Cox, you received four complaints about 
calling male residents by girl's names.

248
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:36,349
Oh-ho. JUDY!

249
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:40,892
Oh, you come here, Judy!

250
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,012
Well done, there, Bobbo.

251
00:12:46,047 --> 00:12:48,775
When my patients ask me where I was all afternoon,

252
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,213
I'll just tell them I was too busy attending this ridiculous chat-fest

253
00:12:52,248 --> 00:12:55,085
with you and Dr. What's-He-Over-Compensating-For? here.

254
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,753
Did I say any of you boys could talk? No, I did not.

255
00:12:58,788 --> 00:13:03,063
Now, this part is especially important, so I need everyone's full attention.

256
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:06,129
You come here, you rat-bastard!

257
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,248
Awesome!

258
00:13:10,307 --> 00:13:12,349
Dr. Miller, hi!

259
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:14,088
You, uh, look very nice today.

260
00:13:14,123 --> 00:13:16,620
Thanks! My patient just died, but if I'm looking good, I'm psyched!

261
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:18,701
No, no. It's just that you work in a very tough specialty,

262
00:13:18,736 --> 00:13:22,982
and you manage to maintain your femininity and I find that very...um...sexy.

263
00:13:23,017 --> 00:13:24,720
Are you asking me out on a date?

264
00:13:25,862 --> 00:13:29,793
Please! We just met! ...Not that it would 
make a difference if we hadn't...um....

265
00:13:29,828 --> 00:13:32,401
Look, Dr. Turk is a really good friend of mine--

266
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,199
Uggh.

267
00:13:33,234 --> 00:13:35,465
and he is not a sexist. And I know sexist.

268
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,922
I mean, when my dad's not asking the maid for a neck-rub,

269
00:13:37,957 --> 00:13:39,208
he's telling me if I'm going to get emotional,

270
00:13:39,243 --> 00:13:41,968
I should do it in a closet because no one likes to see a hysterical woman.

271
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:43,103
There's a closet right there!

272
00:13:43,138 --> 00:13:44,541
I know, it's one of my favorites....

273
00:13:44,576 --> 00:13:47,526
Dr. Reid! I've seen you strutting around 
this place with your can-do attitude,

274
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:50,475
and I know that you think because you're a 
female doctor, you're part of the solution.

275
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,366
But you're not. Everything about you screams,

276
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:54,865
"What does the cutie in Radiology think about me?" 

277
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,416
And yes, your friend Dr. Turk, he may ask you relationship advice

278
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:00,725
or where to get his unfortunate girlfriend some naughty lingerie

279
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,576
because we both know that when it comes to gifts,

280
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:05,146
women all crave a nice leather push-up bra with tassels that go

281
00:14:05,181 --> 00:14:08,781
around and around and around like this -- but still, I ask you, is that respect?

282
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:11,807
Uh, don't answer. I don't care!

283
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:14,378
Aaaaaaaaagggggggghhhhhhh!

284
00:14:14,413 --> 00:14:15,890
Move, Barbie! Move! Barbie!

285
00:14:20,465 --> 00:14:22,368
<i>Yes! He fell! I'm gonna get away!</i>

286
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,258
<i>...You know who I haven't seen today?</i>

287
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:26,360
Ook! Waaagh!

288
00:14:26,554 --> 00:14:27,653
 You lookin' for that?

289
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:29,175
Like you read about.

290
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:29,731
Come here, you.

291
00:14:29,777 --> 00:14:30,553
Ack!

292
00:14:30,598 --> 00:14:31,598
Come on!

293
00:14:31,635 --> 00:14:32,635
Well, uh...

294
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,434
Spill.

295
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:38,627
Dr. Cox had nothing to do with me going to see your scary friends.

296
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:39,874
I did it all on my own.

297
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:41,471
I love how adult our relationship is!

298
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:44,572
Fine. You want some straight shootin'?

299
00:14:44,607 --> 00:14:47,672
I'm glad that you're dealing with Ben's death so well.

300
00:14:47,707 --> 00:14:49,450
The fact is I'm strugglin'.

301
00:14:49,485 --> 00:14:52,247
And having those two harpies nesting in our home is not helping.

302
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:56,104
For the life of me, Jordan, I cannot figure out why they're still here.

303
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:57,918
It is beyond me!

304
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,058
You okay?

305
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,631
Why don't you grow a pair, Sally!

306
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,902
Oh, oka--that's going in the box.

307
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:09,866
Girl's names are out. That's why we have a box.

308
00:15:15,423 --> 00:15:16,248
Well?

309
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,570
I hate to quote my mother,

310
00:15:17,605 --> 00:15:20,444
but Dr. Miller is so uptight she could use a pitcher of martinis

311
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:22,598
and an afternoon on top of a smooth-chested pool-boy.

312
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:23,846
I knew you'd hate her.

313
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:27,400
I love her! Turk, do you know what I would give to have

314
00:15:27,435 --> 00:15:30,805
a female attending like her pushing me not to let 
the fact that I'm a woman hold me back?

315
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,399
I mean...you have no idea how hard it is.

316
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,718
I have no idea?

317
00:15:35,753 --> 00:15:38,251
Look, I'm not gonna fight about whether in 
medicine it's harder being black or a woman.

318
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:39,349
Black!

319
00:15:39,384 --> 00:15:40,029
Woman!

320
00:15:42,228 --> 00:15:43,426
Much prop, Dr. Rhodes.

321
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:44,218
Mm.

322
00:15:44,253 --> 00:15:45,127
Go get 'em.

323
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:47,365
Turk, let me ask you one question.

324
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,015
Gun to your head, who do you think make better doctors, men or women?

325
00:15:57,215 --> 00:16:02,403
Nooooooo, Todd. The term "melons" is just as bad as "sweater meat."

326
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:04,710
Well then I am thoroughly confused!

327
00:16:04,745 --> 00:16:07,025
This is a total waste of time!

328
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,936
And do you know why it's a total waste of time?

329
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:14,362
Well, now, take Bobbo, here. He's just 
a product of a different era!

330
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:19,645
Foxy, Enid!

331
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,479
Oh!

332
00:16:20,514 --> 00:16:23,501
Hot mama.

333
00:16:25,238 --> 00:16:26,811
Those were the days.

334
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:28,511
And...this one.

335
00:16:28,546 --> 00:16:32,259
God save me, I can't even imagine what 
that upbringing must have been like.

336
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:38,760
Boy, I'd like to take a swig out of her jugs.

337
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:42,351
Hey, I'm talking, numb-nuts!

338
00:16:42,386 --> 00:16:44,886
Dad! I'm listening to 'Annie'!

339
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:48,963
It is a hard-knock life.

340
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:52,675
My point is that in this tight-ass PC culture,

341
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,661
it is damn hard to know what's kosher!

342
00:16:55,696 --> 00:16:58,574
Well, then you should try stepping into our shoes!

343
00:16:58,609 --> 00:17:02,396
Even the strongest women walk around with this thick coat of armor all day long,

344
00:17:02,431 --> 00:17:05,531
because God forbid we should show the slightest sign of weakness.

345
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,421
So just squeeze those smelly,

346
00:17:07,456 --> 00:17:10,822
oversized feet into the shoes of someone you really care about;

347
00:17:10,857 --> 00:17:14,343
and trust me, in a heartbeat you will know the right thing to do.

348
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:19,066
<i>At that moment, Dr. Cox knew why Jordan's friends were still around.</i>

349
00:17:27,022 --> 00:17:29,661
Oh, would you turn off the lights? The baby doesn't know I'm here.

350
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,385
Doesn't matter. Likes the nanny better than me anyway.

351
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,260
Me too.

352
00:17:36,295 --> 00:17:39,628
Hey, are your friends still in town because I've been wallowing

353
00:17:39,663 --> 00:17:42,617
in self pity and you need somebody to take care...of you?

354
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:45,966
I miss Ben.

355
00:17:50,287 --> 00:17:54,974
Me too. God, me too.

356
00:18:03,106 --> 00:18:04,383
You want me to help you move that table?

357
00:18:06,122 --> 00:18:08,820
Not that you can't move it!

358
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,447
What do you want, Dr. Turk?

359
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:12,836
I was just thinking about...you know,

360
00:18:12,871 --> 00:18:16,011
what you were saying when I said that thing, and--

361
00:18:16,046 --> 00:18:17,184
Just say it.

362
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:20,284
...I'm sorry.

363
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:22,818
Scrub up.

364
00:18:24,307 --> 00:18:25,428
So we're cool?

365
00:18:25,463 --> 00:18:31,969
-Ish. But you're a decent surgeon, and uh, I'm not one to be petty.

366
00:18:32,004 --> 00:18:35,300
So why don't we put on a little music?

367
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:37,074
Yes. Why don't we.

368
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:45,715
<i>There will always be a battle for power between the sexes.</i>

369
00:18:49,318 --> 00:18:51,526
<i>Sometimes a man just has to give in.</i>

370
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,015
Gotta grab those.

371
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,415
Ugh!

372
00:18:59,757 --> 00:19:03,934
Remember, we look...but we don't touch.

373
00:19:03,969 --> 00:19:05,260
Okay.

374
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:07,790
<i>Other times it's enough just to take a positive step.</i>

375
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:18,834
<i>And once in a while, even it seems cliche', a man just has to be there for her.</i>

376
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:23,597
You know, honey, I'm--I'm here now, if you--
if you want your friends to leave.

377
00:19:23,632 --> 00:19:26,434
We're getting chemical peels tomorrow.

378
00:19:26,469 --> 00:19:28,329
Oh. Okay.

379
00:19:35,226 --> 00:19:36,388
Oh...guh.
