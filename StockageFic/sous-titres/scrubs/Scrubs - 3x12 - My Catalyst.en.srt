1
00:00:01,391 --> 00:00:04,191
Everyone here thinks
they know me inside and out

2
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:05,392
You look like you could use some help

3
00:00:05,427 --> 00:00:06,172
Nope

4
00:00:06,231 --> 00:00:07,754
Even random people

5
00:00:07,789 --> 00:00:09,117
You need help, Dr. Dorian?

6
00:00:09,152 --> 00:00:10,596
No thanks, Dr... whatever your name is

7
00:00:10,832 --> 00:00:12,020
They won't leave me alone

8
00:00:12,286 --> 00:00:13,217
Free help, here

9
00:00:13,237 --> 00:00:14,267
Piss off, Mickhead

10
00:00:14,478 --> 00:00:16,468
You'd think by now they'd know
where I'm gonna end up

11
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:19,331
Dr. Cox? I could use a little help

12
00:00:19,412 --> 00:00:21,161
Beyoncé, you could use a lot of help

13
00:00:21,225 --> 00:00:23,745
But, hey, we all have to play
the hand the Big Guy dealt us

14
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,890
You know, unless you're lucky enough to have

15
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:28,459
those insanely over-hyped 'Queer Eye'
guys show up at your door

16
00:00:28,597 --> 00:00:32,728
but I doubt even they have the brass ones
necessary to fix whatever the hell this is

17
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:35,289
Yeah, if you wanna use the appearance angle
to knock down my self-esteem,

18
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:40,638
best to do it on a day when my hair doesn't
look awesome! I know it's new wax

19
00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:41,665
What is?

20
00:00:41,783 --> 00:00:42,927
It's okay to want a piece!

21
00:00:44,617 --> 00:00:46,883
I just want you to check out
Mrs. Barlow's chart

22
00:00:46,918 --> 00:00:49,690
I'm always second-guessing myself
when it comes to interstitial lung diseases

23
00:00:49,762 --> 00:00:51,733
Oh, then you should definitely
handle this yourself, there, Britney

24
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,909
I'm going with female pop stars today

25
00:00:54,944 --> 00:00:57,235
The point is that back
when I was a resident,

26
00:00:57,372 --> 00:00:59,659
I had all sorts of trouble
with metabolic diseases

27
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:00,640
You know what I did?

28
00:01:00,737 --> 00:01:03,106
I grabbed every case I could get my hands on

29
00:01:03,507 --> 00:01:05,066
until I had it down pat.

30
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:06,041
Got it

31
00:01:06,347 --> 00:01:07,700
...You really had trouble
with metabolic diseases?

32
00:01:07,814 --> 00:01:09,748
Noo... I'm a good doctor

33
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:11,480
Oh

34
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:12,460
Here you go

35
00:01:14,364 --> 00:01:19,857
Oh, hello, Mr. Gallbladder.
Don't you get too comfy next to Mr. Liver

36
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,313
Because here comes Dr. Turk's robot laser.

37
00:01:25,675 --> 00:01:28,843
Hey, Christopher.
I could do without the color commentary

38
00:01:29,236 --> 00:01:31,421
Why it gotta be a "color commentary"?
'Cause I'm doing it?

39
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:32,762
Just kiddin'

40
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:36,878
That was a near-perfect laparoscopic cholecystectomy!

41
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:39,109
Have you been working on your dexterity?

42
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:43,346
Well, I've been playing a little John Madden Football on my X-Box...

43
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:47,720
I'd like to play John Madden Football... on _her_ x-box

44
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:51,150
On who, Todd? There are no women here

45
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:52,699
Well, it's still funny!

46
00:01:53,082 --> 00:01:58,723
The Todd here used to be our number one lap-chole guy.
But the torch has been passed

47
00:01:59,309 --> 00:01:59,973
Thank you, sir!

48
00:02:00,473 --> 00:02:02,452
Dude! Yo, wait till you hear this!

49
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:05,920
Dr. Wen just said that I'm their number one lap-chole guy now!

50
00:02:06,148 --> 00:02:07,864
Disappointed?

51
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:12,649
I shoulda waited till there was a chick around
to make that "x-box" joke, you know?

52
00:02:15,984 --> 00:02:17,714
He knows...

53
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,798
I was excited for Turk.
And, God bless him, he was excited about my big hair news!

54
00:02:23,985 --> 00:02:25,130
New wax did that?

55
00:02:25,175 --> 00:02:26,359
I couldn't believe it either!

56
00:02:26,524 --> 00:02:27,737
New wax did that?

57
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:28,831
I couldn't believe it either!

58
00:02:28,985 --> 00:02:29,478
Oh

59
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:31,444
Ye-oh, sorry about the girl talk

60
00:02:31,558 --> 00:02:34,529
Oh, that's fine. We were talking man talk... you know...
Really big trucks...

61
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,521
Solo-Flex... Have you
seen these lately? Sweat

62
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,343
Your hair smells like Elliot's

63
00:02:38,413 --> 00:02:40,287
Well, your breath smells like chimichangas!

64
00:02:41,736 --> 00:02:42,361
Is that racist?

65
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:46,021
That depends
Did you have chimichangas for breakfast?

66
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:47,173
Maybe...

67
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:50,969
I think what Carla really smelled was all the excitement in the air.

68
00:02:50,985 --> 00:02:55,226
See, there's a visiting professor coming today
who's both a medical attending and a surgeon.

69
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:58,843
_Two_ specialties, and to us
that kinda makes him...

70
00:03:01,658 --> 00:03:02,201
...Super-Doc!

71
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:10,757
...Super-Doc!

72
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:11,304
Dammit!

73
00:03:14,553 --> 00:03:17,888
...Fine. A super-doc with obsessive-compulsive disorder

74
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:24,132
Okay, okay. How hard can it be for me to step in here,
left foot first and simultaneously exhale as my right foot plants? How hard?

75
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:25,281
Not that hard?

76
00:03:25,393 --> 00:03:28,575
Exactly!... Shaved-head guy

77
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:31,902
Whose hair smells like lilacs?

78
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:32,488
Hers

79
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:33,697
And his

80
00:03:34,022 --> 00:03:34,399
Huh?

81
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:35,859
That's very pretty

82
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,206
And deeply disturbing

83
00:03:39,196 --> 00:03:40,481
The jar said unisex

84
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:41,090
I know

85
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:41,840
_Unisex_

86
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:42,764
I know

87
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:43,779
Dammit!

88
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:45,444

91
00:03:57,614 --> 00:04:03,002
Dr. Kevin Casey... Dr. Kevin Casey...

92
00:04:03,037 --> 00:04:05,818
you know, at my hospital, they don't make you sign forms
if you wanna cut open sick people

93
00:04:05,905 --> 00:04:08,566
you just have to bring your own... knifey thingie...

94
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:09,222
"Scalpel"

95
00:04:09,588 --> 00:04:11,395
That's the word!
Dr. Kevin Casey...

96
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,203
Why do you keep saying your name?

97
00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:19,260
Oh, it just keeps me from losing my, uh... jinkies later,
thinking I forgot something

98
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:21,038
Okay...

99
00:04:21,397 --> 00:04:27,098
Dr. Kevin Casey... Dr. Kevin Casey

100
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:34,096
It's okay, you can say it

101
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,950
It's just that you're... you're a doctor with pretty severe OCD

102
00:04:38,185 --> 00:04:39,436
It's not a secret

103
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:41,938
I know. I always talk like this

104
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,133
You're gonna have a hard time keeping
that up the whole month I'm here

105
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:45,157
I can do it!

106
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:46,693
I believe in you!

107
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:55,050
Kevin Casey? Holy cow, get outta Dodge!
Te-tell me this, are you-are ya shaking hands nowadays?

108
00:04:55,306 --> 00:05:02,076
Well, a lifetime of therapy... and a... whole lotta Zoloft...
just so I can appropriately greet you, big guy!

109
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:03,248
Atta boy!

110
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:05,370
I do have a two-second limit

111
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,290
Boy, who doesn't!

112
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:16,177
You realize I haven't laid eyes on you since we were residents together?
And I'll tell you this, big Kev-o, I always knew I'd see ya again

113
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:20,199
Boy, I never thought I'd see that guy again!

114
00:05:20,456 --> 00:05:25,707
I mean, he had to drop out of our residency class
because of the God-awful severity of his condition!

115
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,123
I can't imagine you as a resident

116
00:05:29,368 --> 00:05:30,064
Hey, Coxy!

117
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,097
Shut up, jackass!
I rock!

118
00:05:35,277 --> 00:05:38,507
Was the blond hair and the earring 'cause you were
in a rock band or 'cause you loved pirates?

119
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:39,553
What?

120
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:40,557
Loved pirates! Just like me!

121
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:44,253
I _don't_ want a piece

122
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,444
Well you're the only one. Okay?

123
00:05:46,486 --> 00:05:48,804
Doctor Cox I'm'unna take you
out for a beer tonight.

124
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:52,278
I want to hear all the stories
about what my mentor was like as a newbie

125
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:57,931
Look, Pink, for the billionth time, no,
I will not go out for a beer with you.

126
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:04,554
Now repeat after me: Dr. Cox, you are not now,
nor will you ever be, my mentor.

127
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:09,467
Dr. Cox, you are not now,
nor will you ever be, my mentor

128
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,550
YES!

129
00:06:18,234 --> 00:06:22,122
That oughtta keep those damn crows
from crapping on my car all the time

130
00:06:22,774 --> 00:06:27,300
I doubt they'll be back, sir.
You know, unless someone who comes up here every day,

131
00:06:27,311 --> 00:06:32,765
trying to find the courage the jump, passes the time
by throwing birdseed on your car's hood

132
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:35,329
Stop babbling, Ted. No one's ever listening

133
00:06:36,457 --> 00:06:40,259
Oh, by the way, the Italian gentlemen 
that haul our medical waste away called 

134
00:06:40,204 --> 00:06:44,568
and said if we don't stop putting our regular trash
in with the medical loads, they're gonna charge us double

135
00:06:45,802 --> 00:06:48,617
My new associate Randall
and I can get rid of that garbage for you

136
00:06:49,037 --> 00:06:49,872
What the hell are you two doing here?

137
00:06:50,955 --> 00:06:52,393
We come up here on our breaks to wrestle

138
00:06:52,397 --> 00:06:53,377
And drink beer

139
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,138
Only the winner drinks beer

140
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:58,587
How much to make the garbage go away?

141
00:06:59,612 --> 00:07:01,273
Say... twenty bucks a month?

142
00:07:01,585 --> 00:07:02,769
Twenty-three bucks a month?

143
00:07:03,652 --> 00:07:04,478
Deal!

144
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:10,192
Sir, those darn birds are back

145
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:14,951
Dr. Kevin Casey...

146
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,108
I have to say it was amazing watching Dr. Casey work

147
00:07:18,253 --> 00:07:19,923
All right, Carol, let's just put it out there

148
00:07:20,813 --> 00:07:24,979
you've got Lupus. But instead of dwelling on the negative,
let's look at the positive signs, okay?

149
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,149
 Your, uh, pericarditis is resolving,
your renal function is good

150
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:35,575
Suicidal scavenger birds also an excellent sign,
right Doctor?

151
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,800
It's a great sign

152
00:07:37,345 --> 00:07:38,561
Okie-dokie, artichokie

153
00:07:40,885 --> 00:07:42,504
You are unflappable!

154
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:44,628
It's true - I can't be flapped

155
00:07:44,663 --> 00:07:45,668
I'm more skittish

156
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:47,608
Yeah, you know, you're like a big squirrel

157
00:07:47,797 --> 00:07:51,392
I wish a was a swashbuckling doctor.
You know... like a pirate

158
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:54,160
Enough about pirates! Wait until you know him better

159
00:07:54,331 --> 00:07:55,514
Ahoy, there

160
00:07:56,426 --> 00:07:58,737
You going to the, uh... O.Arrr? Heh

161
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:00,826
I said enough!

162
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:07,616
You know, I couldn't have survived in medicine if I didn't
embrace my OCD. And since I was compulsive anyway, you know

163
00:08:07,782 --> 00:08:12,721
I- I read the same text books over and over, I, uh,
I went through the procedures over and over,

164
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:16,967
I imagined every worst-case scenario over
and over and over and over and over and over and over

165
00:08:17,508 --> 00:08:18,273
Dr. Casey

166
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,307
- and over and over and over-

167
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:19,611
Dr. Casey!

168
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:20,821
Dr. Kevin Casey
Oh Thank you

169
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:21,301
Yeah

170
00:08:21,336 --> 00:08:25,607
Even though my crazy brain made me do those things,
it's still the best advice I can give to any young doctor:

171
00:08:25,642 --> 00:08:28,488
Expect the unexpected and you will never be surprised

172
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:33,801
It's weird, after one day it already felt like he was
the type of mentor I always wished Dr. Cox would be.

173
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:37,474
Still, I've gotta stay cool; I know I'm prone to hero worship

174
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:39,824
Man, the surgeon in me is antsy

175
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:42,025
I need to cut somebody up

176
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:46,894
Thanks for volunteering.
I'm not really that strong on the brain

177
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:48,845
I think this is the language center

178
00:08:49,085 --> 00:08:50,574
Really? 'Cause I don't feel the

179
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:54,653
daaaaaaaiiiiiioooooooowwww... heh-heh-how cool is thaaaat!

180
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:56,887
And this is the foreign language center

181
00:08:56,922 --> 00:08:58,889
Impossible! Je ne parle Français!

182
00:09:00,947 --> 00:09:03,521
The cow says...
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

183
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:05,712
The sheep says...
BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

184
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,907
Ladies and gentlemen, Macaulay Culkin...

185
00:09:09,428 --> 00:09:11,999
The French would help with the ladies...

186
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:22,673
Dr. Wen! Can I ask you a question?
Was my time on the lap-chole even faster than yours?

187
00:09:22,793 --> 00:09:24,162
Yes, it was

188
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:27,039
Because some of the guys were saying
I totally kicked your ass

189
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:32,461
and I wanted them to shut up, you know if it wasn't true,
but since it is, I'll just let it go.

190
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:36,710
What?

191
00:09:37,163 --> 00:09:40,958
If there is one thing I've learned at this hospital,
it's that you should never antagonize your boss

192
00:09:40,985 --> 00:09:45,444
or the people that make the food, because either way you
end up eating poo. Hear it, learn it, live it. Huh?

193
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:50,440
Elliot, I can do whatever I want.
Because these... are magic!

194
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:54,245
These? Are gonna take me wherever I wanna go in life

195
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:59,241
Thanks to these! I'm king of the world, baby!
Can you feel it!? Gimme your pudding!

196
00:10:00,463 --> 00:10:01,883
Domo arigato!
(note : mean 'thanks' in japanese)

197
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:04,467
Pay up

198
00:10:05,185 --> 00:10:05,971
Already?

199
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,056
You can look around all you want, you won't find any garbage!
Let's see them twenty-three squids!

200
00:10:14,351 --> 00:10:15,151
It's all here

201
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:19,120
So, come on, what'd you do with all the garbage?

202
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:22,660
That's not part of the deal

203
00:10:23,862 --> 00:10:28,409
Randall. You, me, on the roof, winner takes all

204
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:29,626
You never learn, do you?

205
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:30,866
Jam'on

206
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:41,012
You know, Carla, I gotta say your-your makeup today
does not in any way make you look like a desperate bowling alley prostitute

207
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:42,683
What's with the sweet talk?

208
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:49,008
Oh, maybe Kevin being here is making me regress.
I mean, you realize that back when I was a resident, I was a kind lad

209
00:10:49,058 --> 00:10:49,876
You get out

210
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:54,952
I know. But soon enough I established myself
as the best damn doctor that ever roamed around these filthy halls

211
00:10:54,987 --> 00:11:02,112
which is a curse, actually, because now I'm expected to make
eye contact with every insult to medicine that comes into this dump

212
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:04,328
Here's that CT scan you ordered!

213
00:11:05,487 --> 00:11:06,320
Thank. You

214
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:09,254
Eye contact! He respects me!

215
00:11:09,633 --> 00:11:13,388
What the hell!? He's anemic and he has bone fractures,
yet there's no sign of leukemia

216
00:11:13,852 --> 00:11:16,173
Don't tell me The Great One is stumped!

217
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:21,368
No. It's just that this is not exactly the kind of thing
that you stick your head in on and figure out

218
00:11:22,821 --> 00:11:24,357
He's got Gaucher's disease

219
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:25,605
I beg your pardon?

220
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,331
I took the liberty of testing his blood
for deficiency of beta-glucosidase

221
00:11:30,178 --> 00:11:31,949
Ohhh! I just sent out for one of those!

222
00:11:32,364 --> 00:11:32,666
No you didn't!

223
00:11:33,036 --> 00:11:33,105
Uh-shh!

224
00:11:33,428 --> 00:11:36,902
Well, you know, I-I mean, I never would've have figured it out
if you hadn't done the grunt work

225
00:11:36,973 --> 00:11:40,763
You know, it's like a jar of pickles:
you loosened the lid and - pop! - I took it off

226
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:43,008
Dr. Kevin Casey..

227
00:11:47,662 --> 00:11:48,296
See ya

228
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,007
Luckily for Kevin, he was getting the chance
to meet everyone around here

229
00:12:03,126 --> 00:12:10,094
See, the reason the X-Box joke should work is that "x-box"
is like the perfect word for a girl's party zone!

230
00:12:11,923 --> 00:12:15,673
Uh... "The Todd", is it?

231
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:16,956
Oh, yeah

232
00:12:16,995 --> 00:12:19,468
Can you go make a very important phone call for me?

233
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:20,344
To who?

234
00:12:20,694 --> 00:12:21,977
To anyone

235
00:12:24,752 --> 00:12:25,853
Makin' a phone call!

236
00:12:26,318 --> 00:12:30,243
Hey, Dr. Casey, do you mind if I scrub in
on the lap-chole you're doing this afternoon?

237
00:12:30,258 --> 00:12:31,598
Okay, I'll see you at four

238
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,600
Cool trick

239
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:39,659
Yeah, you should try it. It's good for dexterity, concentration...
and convincing single women you're a power-dork

240
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:50,151
You know, I'm really looking forward to seeing you in action, sir.
It takes a lot to make the big dog sit up and take notice. Heh.

241
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,326
I believe the word you're looking for is "holy crap"

242
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:59,279
Holy crap!

243
00:13:00,303 --> 00:13:03,973
I'm sorry, J.D., I just don't think pirates are cool

244
00:13:04,008 --> 00:13:05,789
Well then you're not cool, Doug!

245
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:08,287
J.D., do you wanna get a beer tonight?

246
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,793
Do chickens wish they could fly?

247
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,889
I have no idea.

248
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:13,836
I like to think they do

249
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:15,045
So do I

250
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:21,577
Okay, class! We have a guest with us at rounds today,
happens to be an old friend of yours truly

251
00:13:21,607 --> 00:13:26,700
so let's all go out of our way to treat him
with the respect he deserves. Nnnnnnnn'kay?

252
00:13:27,518 --> 00:13:28,102
Hey, gang. My name is Dr. Kevin Cas-

253
00:13:28,137 --> 00:13:33,448
Anyway! I thought we'd change things up a little bit today
- instead of me firing questions at you

254
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:39,193
I'd like to see you all scurry away and get your text books.
And when you get back, you actually get to quiz us

255
00:13:39,646 --> 00:13:44,300
A little harmless competition,
if my colleague here will consent to it?

256
00:13:47,823 --> 00:13:50,241
I'm sorry; are you done with the speechifying?

257
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:52,919
I'm kidding, you frightening bastard!

258
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:53,893
Oh-ho-hokay

259
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:56,956
buddy-buddy-buddy! Oh! Buddy-buddy-buddy-buddy-buddy!

260
00:13:56,991 --> 00:13:58,765
GO GET YOUR BOOKS!

261
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,920
Try not to touch me as much

262
00:14:01,955 --> 00:14:02,575
Fair enough

263
00:14:05,682 --> 00:14:10,918
Now look, security said your van hasn't left the premises
So I demand to know where all the trash is going

264
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,580
...Away

265
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:19,347
I'm going to tell you the same thing I told the grocer
when it was my turn to bring the deli spread to Hank Weinberg's poker night

266
00:14:19,743 --> 00:14:23,192
This better be kosher.
Otherwise, it's not just Ted who's gonna pay for it.

267
00:14:26,026 --> 00:14:34,235
If people keep pushing me for no reason,
I swear I will hurl myself off this building!

268
00:14:34,664 --> 00:14:35,713
I'm not cleaning you up

269
00:14:35,948 --> 00:14:36,929
Arm

270
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:45,717
Mark my words!
If one more person is mean to me for no reason, I'll do it!

271
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:46,989
Shut up, bozo

272
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:50,174
One more person. She didn't know the rules

273
00:14:51,998 --> 00:14:57,020
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!
One of you minions spit out another question, will ya! Yo! Nervous Guy-

274
00:14:57,055 --> 00:15:01,473
- now I don't care how many times your little
prepubescent voice cracks. Hit me, baby!

275
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:07,676
Okay... Wh-what is the demyelinating CNS
disorder associated with the JC virus?

276
00:15:08,336 --> 00:15:15,876
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
Snore! Back to you, there, half-pint.

277
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:19,207
Yeah, short jokes are a sign of desperation,
my friend

278
00:15:19,597 --> 00:15:20,639
Amen, brother

279
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:24,671
Uh...
... uh... uh... over... here!

280
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:28,496
Uh, yes... blonde girl...
You have yet _another_ question?

281
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:34,217
Um, what is the pathologic abnormality
causing Bernard-Soulier disease?

282
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:36,198
Absence of von Willebrand receptors

283
00:15:36,295 --> 00:15:37,446
Uh, listen, I hate to be childish about this,
but I have to, uh... "make".

284
00:15:37,481 --> 00:15:44,626
And for me that involves driving home and scrubbing
the toilet seat several times with industrial-strength cleanser

285
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:46,503
So, if we could just call this a tie...?

286
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:50,351
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Ties are for sissies.
Speaking of which, Newbie?

287
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:52,417
You have been uncharacteristically quiet

288
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,229
I don't know why it popped into my head...

289
00:15:56,276 --> 00:15:58,519
You really had trouble with metabolic diseases?

290
00:15:58,554 --> 00:16:00,938
Noo... I'm a good doctor

291
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:03,728
...but I knew I had him

292
00:16:04,238 --> 00:16:07,779
My question is concerning metabolic diseases

293
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:11,547
Oh, yes

294
00:16:12,947 --> 00:16:19,262
What is the inborn error of metabolism
characterized by angiokeratomas? Please?

295
00:16:21,043 --> 00:16:25,485
Okay, first I think that we should...
we should go over the rules

296
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:30,279
Because, you see, if by some freak of nature
I'm not able to answer a question,

297
00:16:30,314 --> 00:16:35,970
then old Kev-Kev here cannot be declared the winner
unless he can provide the answer for said question

298
00:16:36,313 --> 00:16:37,163
Otherwise we're just going back and forth, back an-

299
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:44,239
Fabry's Disease. Page two thousand, ninety-eight of Harrison's
Guide to Internal Medicine. It's a fun game, but I-I, uh, I'll be back in 48 minutes

300
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:49,447
It's funny how one person can shake
another's foundation to the core

301
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,191
Half the time, the guy doesn't even know he did it!

302
00:16:53,237 --> 00:16:55,656
Watching Dr. Casey's procedure again?

303
00:16:55,691 --> 00:16:57,157
He's so fast

304
00:16:57,382 --> 00:17:00,619
Yep. He's out of our league

305
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:08,761
Funnier still how the same guy could be the mentor
I've always been looking for

306
00:17:09,935 --> 00:17:15,597
Nice place. It's got that-that great...
vomit and peanut smell

307
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,677
Yeah... Reminds me of my first girlfriend.
She was a carnie

308
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:24,177
You know, I'm always trying to get Cox to come out
and get a beer with me - he never does

309
00:17:24,737 --> 00:17:28,145
Hey, you're not one of those guys who carries around pictures
of him and his attending, are you?

310
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:32,440
Ahhhh, perfect!

311
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:36,630
Well, I don't carry anything around...

312
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:40,205
Good. 'Cause you know, those-those losers
who've been practicing medicine for three years

313
00:17:40,438 --> 00:17:44,908
but are still looking for some kind of mentor to pat 'em on the back
are just... pathetic, you know what I mean?

314
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:47,027
Totally

315
00:17:47,672 --> 00:17:50,860
Yep. It's funny what one person can do

316
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:54,129
Aw, okay, I'm gonna need another beer

317
00:17:58,568 --> 00:18:01,537
None of us slept last night.
How I know that is irrelevant

318
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,818
What does matter is I think
we formed a special bond because of it

319
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,952
Stop looking at me or die

320
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:10,968
What's worse is that the guy who caused it
thinks we're his best friends

321
00:18:11,313 --> 00:18:12,635
Morning, fellas!

322
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:14,591
Whatta say there, Kev

323
00:18:14,716 --> 00:18:18,458
All right, all six of your butt cheeks just,
uh, tightened up

324
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,774
Someone around here pissing you guys off?
'Cause I will give 'em some attitude

325
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,580
Uhhh...
That guy!

326
00:18:24,098 --> 00:18:28,513
Hey, Hair Club!
That suit, that come with the flop sweat?

327
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:39,376
You can do this, Theodore!
Take as much time as you need

328
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:46,300
Okay... Here we go, baby

329
00:18:48,863 --> 00:18:51,456
I just don't understand
why this guy bothers him so much

330
00:18:51,491 --> 00:18:56,790
Carla, Perry is a dysfunctional, unsuccessful,
emotionally-damaged old man! No offense, sweetie

331
00:18:57,127 --> 00:18:57,551
None taken

332
00:18:57,618 --> 00:19:00,316
Being the best doctor here is the only thing
he had to hang his hat on

333
00:19:00,654 --> 00:19:06,747
Listen, just because we have a child together doesn't 
necessarily mean you know me, mmm'kay, princess? Watch and learn

334
00:19:06,782 --> 00:19:09,817
Say, Kev-Kev? Would you love to come and join us?

335
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:10,846
Oh, thanks

336
00:19:11,747 --> 00:19:13,607
Um, what's up with the oatmeal today?

337
00:19:14,818 --> 00:19:15,704
Too much milk

338
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:19,334
Not enough butter

339
00:19:20,363 --> 00:19:21,672
That's it!

340
00:19:22,024 --> 00:19:26,826
Did you just diagnose the oatmeal?
You can't just go and diagnose the oatmeal

341
00:19:27,852 --> 00:19:30,988
He just did.
Kevin, are you single?

342
00:19:31,157 --> 00:19:32,438
Yeah. Why, are you?

343
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,747
I'm thinking about it

344
00:19:33,852 --> 00:19:34,864
Heh. Yeah, me too

345
00:19:35,185 --> 00:19:41,719
What-what in the hell... just happened?
Just... J-What just happened!?

346
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:47,574
Okay, I've removed the gallbladder,
sealed the vessels, aaaand time!

347
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:53,322
Oh, my God! You can't even beat Dr. Kevin Casey's
lap-chole time when you're _imagining_ it!

348
00:19:54,113 --> 00:19:58,160
So! I could be just as fast if I was like him
and practiced over and over again on a simulator

349
00:19:58,566 --> 00:19:59,220
Yeah... but you don't

350
00:19:59,255 --> 00:20:02,803
Yeah, well I could spend my spare time
doing stupid hand exercises!

351
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,263
I know... but you don't

352
00:20:04,563 --> 00:20:05,398
Yeah, well, I could-

353
00:20:05,443 --> 00:20:05,910
You don't

354
00:20:05,945 --> 00:20:06,377
But-

355
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:07,346
Don't!

356
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:10,096
Could you enjoy this any less?

357
00:20:10,973 --> 00:20:15,645
Because of theeeeeeeese! I don't think I can

358
00:20:17,312 --> 00:20:19,381
In! Gallbladder! Out! Done!

359
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,923
Four seconds! A new record! World record!

360
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,094
Look, I did my psych rotation,
okay?

361
00:20:28,347 --> 00:20:31,979
I know my father abandoning us
and only showing up in my life 

362
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:36,170
when he needs a place to sleep or a free
prostate exam is probably gonna be an issue

363
00:20:36,543 --> 00:20:39,820
I get it. But it's not like
I'm looking for a-a mentor...

364
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:47,565
I just want a little validation. It's like when Kelso gave you
a cupcake 'cause you went four days without killing a patient

365
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,150
That was awesome

366
00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:49,079
You know!

367
00:20:51,176 --> 00:20:55,543
I've always felt like Doug understood me.
It's weird; after knowing him for three years

368
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:58,899
I suddenly realized he was the type of mentor
I always wished Dr. Cox would be

369
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:00,979
Wait!

370
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:03,498
Doug, get the hell outta here!

371
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:04,689
Okay

372
00:21:07,127 --> 00:21:14,776
I think when rational men are forced to face their shortcomings
they all do the same thing: Blame Kevin Casey!

373
00:21:15,296 --> 00:21:19,031
Who gave him the right to judge me?
'Cause I sure didn't! I'll give him a piece of my mind!

374
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:23,243
See how he likes it! Unfortunately no one
knew where the son of a bitch was!

375
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:31,885
Dr. Dorian! I'm far too irritable right now to pretend
I don't hate you, so let's cut to the chase

376
00:21:32,138 --> 00:21:38,310
If you know where all the garbage in this hospital is going,
I'll give you... eight dollars

377
00:21:40,022 --> 00:21:40,856
Sorry, sir

378
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:42,734
Thanks!

379
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:43,252
Huh?

380
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:43,905
Dr. Kelso?

381
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:44,398
What?

382
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:46,991
The crows are back.
They're making your pimp-mobile look like SpinArt

383
00:21:47,026 --> 00:21:47,699
Dammit!

384
00:21:49,323 --> 00:21:58,275
It's just one step.
Come on, already! Aww, who'm I kidding?

385
00:22:05,796 --> 00:22:11,595
You did it, Teddy! It's over! Here comes sweet relief!

386
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,306
Is this heaven?

387
00:22:19,998 --> 00:22:21,147
It's garbage

388
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,482
Way to cost us a cherry gig, bra

389
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:24,937
Wha?

390
00:22:25,862 --> 00:22:32,286
I want my money back!
And Ted! Shower and get back to work!

391
00:22:33,814 --> 00:22:36,366
You know, if you try that around the corner,
you can land right in the street

392
00:22:40,884 --> 00:22:46,799
Found him! Brace yourself, mister!
You're about to get an earful! J.D. style!

393
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,117
Hey, buddy

394
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:55,824
Hey... hey... Uh, give-give me a minute, will you?

395
00:22:56,217 --> 00:22:59,196
No, Kevin, I have to talk to you _right_ _now_

396
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:02,280
DAMMIT!

397
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,913
Later's cool too

398
00:23:05,123 --> 00:23:10,470
I'm sorry. I just, I... Look, I spent the last few days
meeting new people and...

399
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,797
trying to get used to this place,
and I'm stressed and I'm fried...

400
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,368
...and I just want to go home...

401
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,800
But here's the punchline:
even though my last surgery was two hours ago

402
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:22,130
I can't stop washing my damn hands

403
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:28,169
AAAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!

404
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:32,199
I'm sorry...

405
00:23:32,234 --> 00:23:38,060
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Look... this is a weak moment

406
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:41,599
Nobody's supposed to see this.

407
00:23:44,913 --> 00:23:49,191
And, uh, mark my words, I'll clean up the soap.
... Probably several thousand times.

408
00:23:54,222 --> 00:23:56,495
Everyone's got their own burdens, J.D.

409
00:23:58,058 --> 00:24:04,309
and I'm not gonna be one of those people that dumps
mine on somebody else. Now whatta you need?

410
00:24:08,805 --> 00:24:09,873
Nothing

411
00:24:19,983 --> 00:24:21,480
None of us needed anything

412
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,100
I think owning your burdens is half the battle

413
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:42,356
Turk knows that he'll eventually have
to decide what his priorities really are...

414
00:24:43,611 --> 00:24:46,611
Baby. Come to bed

415
00:24:56,372 --> 00:24:59,686
And Dr. Cox knows he has to find
something else to hang his hat on

416
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:04,685
You, my friend, are going to be
the best baseball player in the world

417
00:25:04,893 --> 00:25:08,748
Which will make me the best
baseball player in the world's father

418
00:25:12,114 --> 00:25:14,898
Can't you hear it, Jack? Can't you hear it?

419
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,578
Still, it's not that daunting if you look around
and see what other people have to deal with

420
00:25:22,034 --> 00:25:23,650
Goodnight, Dr. Casey

421
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:25,992
'Night, J.D.

422
00:25:33,628 --> 00:25:37,346
song: Coldplay's "Everything's Not Lost"

423
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:40,673
synchro: David Durrenberger
