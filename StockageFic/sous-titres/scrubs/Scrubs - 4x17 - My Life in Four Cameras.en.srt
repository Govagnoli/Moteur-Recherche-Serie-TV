1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,870
Things were amazing with Kylie,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,950
but before I could get more emotionally invested,

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,730
I needed answers to some questions that were very important to me.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,360
Name 3 spin-offs of the sitcom Happy Days.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,260
Mork and Mindy, Laverne and Shirley, and Joanie loves Chachi.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,360
You marry her.You marry her now.You marry her!

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,260
Ok, ok! We passed section one: "Sitcoms about or involving asian-american diner owners."

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,830
Now onto section 2:

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,620
Fat, tubby tv husbands and the crazy-hot women that would never actually be married to them."

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,100
Hey, we're missing Sanford and son.

11
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,810
- What?
- Yes!

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,460
Turk was freaked out because Carla never joins us on Sanford and son night...

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,840
or Cheers night.

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,950
I think it was because she was feeling a little romantically competitive with Kylie and me.

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,480
Woman, woman!

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,250
I am not a lollipop!

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,620
Quiet down now...

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,660
it is time to watch the show yes, it started...

19
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:02,290
don't be lickin' me no mo' matter of fact, could you get me a handiwipe?

20
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,620
Carla certainly tried to be as adorable as us.

21
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,830
Ohh! Darn it! You won.

22
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,790
Unfortunately, Turk wasn't on the same wavelength.

23
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,690
Do you see what you get, Carla?!

24
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,790
Do you see what you get when you mess with the warrior?!

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,140
Yes!

26
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,400
10 to 9:00!

27
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,740
- Hi.
- Hi.

28
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,800
- Bye.
- Bye.

29
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,020
Kylie's in class all day, and she bartends at night, and I'm still pulling 16-hour shifts, so...

30
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,560
we try to make sure we kiss at least once a day.

31
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,360
Mondays, wednesdays, and fridays, she takes a cab over here.

32
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,910
Tuesdays and thursdays... I scooter to my baby!

33
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,850
Honey...

34
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,670
I haven't fuffied in bed in, like, a week.

35
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:05,490
With 27 deaths so far, this strain of E. Coli from tainted meat is quite serious.

36
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,370
So if you're a big meat-eater, be careful.

37
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,720
The reason we were upset was that every time the media reports on some weird health crisis,

38
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,720
everyone who sees it thinks they have it.

39
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,770
Oh, not so bad. It's only a few people here.

40
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,900
Ok, ok, everybody just shut up!

41
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,810
Thank you.

42
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,350
Now, who's first?

43
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,020
Of course there's always one positive when something like this happens...

44
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,220
I love medicine!

45
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,220
Whoa. Grandma, that's my no-fly zone.

46
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,690
Script : Raceman & Ncolas 
Synchro : Siefaz

www.forom.com

48
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,920
Uh, dr. Cox!

49
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,840
We're having a bit of a crisis here.

50
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,090
Ah, I see that. It seems you two have worn the same outfit.

51
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,040
Barbie, if it's any consolation,

52
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,220
it looks slightly better on you.

53
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,530
No, I'm talking about all the...

54
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,410
- Thank you.
- Sure.

55
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,180
What the hell are we supposed to do?!

56
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,550
Loretta, relax.

57
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,370
I've been involved in every ridiculous tv-induced panic there is.

58
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,400
Poison pills, SARS, West Nile, north face, south fork, east river,monkey pox,

59
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,360
pop rocks, toilet snakes, mad cow, bird flu, swine flu, and,

60
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:56,530
quite frankly, every other flu that you could really only catch if you actually fornicate with the animal it's named for.

61
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,710
And as a parting gift, I will tell you this.

62
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,430
Narrow it down to 2 symptoms: vomiting and diarrhea,

63
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,040
because it's just not E. Coli unless it's firing out both exits.

64
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,030
Sure hope I don't have dog flu.

65
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,490
Well, Mr. Bernstein, do you have vomiting and diarrhea?

66
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,650
No.

67
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,750
- No.
- No.

68
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,930
- No.
- No.

69
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,110
- No.
- No.

70
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,510
Ok, then, Mr. James, you're free...

71
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,850
Wait a second. Charles James?

72
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:31,580
I was watching the Cheers dvd the other night. Are you Charles James the writer?

73
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,780
Yeah, that's me.

74
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,820
Just... stay... calm.

75
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,620
Uh, Elliot, I need to take this gentleman upstairs for some more tests.

76
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,860
J.D., don't leave me here.

77
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,560
This is very important! He may even need a surgical consult.

78
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,460
- Norm!
- Norm!

79
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,450
Yeah, I get it.

80
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,420
What are you doing? No tongue before 10:00.

81
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,760
Baby, if J.D. And Kylie can make time for that stupid appointment kiss once a day,

82
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,870
we should be able to do it twice a day.

83
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,690
Love is not a competition.

84
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,050
Ok.

85
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,250
Make it 3 times.

86
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,870
- All right. I'll see you at noon?
- Noon.

87
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,390
You youngsters.

88
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,900
If there is one thing I have learned, it's that you can't schedule love.

89
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,530
I think your credit card statement would beg to differ.

90
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,630
Ok, listen up, everyone.

91
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,930
For budgetary reasons, we are turning the bathrooms on even-numbered floors into patient rooms.

92
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,210
To sum up: floors 2 and 4 are no longer for 1 or 2.

93
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,010
Actually, there's still a bathroom on 2, but then my joke wouldn't have worked.

94
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,440
Well?

95
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,690
I'm sorry. Would you please repeat the question?

96
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,490
Are you just gonna roll over like that?

97
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,210
That's weird. I asked him the same thing last night.

98
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,850
Where's the outrage, the anger, the hate?

99
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,450
Again, last night.

100
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,140
You've  gone soft.

101
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,890
Ok, now it's getting spooky.

102
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,450
Look, you're the only one who can stand up to Kelso.

103
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,920
Ladies and gentlemen,

104
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,170
allow me to present...

105
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,850
man not caring.

106
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,490
Ok, Jordan, little help.

107
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,700
If you don't do what she wants,

108
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,610
I'm going to stop having sex with you and start making love.

109
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,570
Love you...

110
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,130
Where  is that bastard?! Kelso?!

111
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,010
My wife's name's Carla.

112
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:22,670
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

113
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,330
- Yeah. Like Carla from the show.
- Just like it.

114
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,140
Wow. I've never actually met anyone who had the same name as a character on the show.

115
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,200
- Really?
- Really?

116
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,100
No.

117
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,940
Well, that's understandable. Yeah.I mean, there's a lot of Sams.

118
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,960
Excuse me, J.D.

119
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,380
I just spent the last 3 hours interviewing 212 hypochondriacs,

120
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,410
half of whom don't speak any English.

121
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,080
Do you have any idea how embarrassing it is to mime diarrhea?!

122
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,850
Talk about your Dianes!

123
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,770
Oh! Damn! It's kiss time!

124
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,650
Baby.

125
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,530
Baby?

126
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,600
Come here, girl. Right here.That's where I want it. I want it right there.

127
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,810
- Where have you been?
- I was up at...

128
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,170
- I've been looking all over for you.
- the Nurses station...

129
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,070
- I gotta go.
- I gotta go.

130
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,390
Bob.

131
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,010
Bob.

132
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,420
Sorry, Madge.

133
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,900
What do you want, Perry?

134
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,010
Bob, enough with the stinkin' budget cuts already.

135
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,400
Noted. Now, if you will excuse me, I have to fire someone.

136
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,960
Oh, baloney, old man!

137
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,750
I have to cut $27,000 from the cafeteria budget,

138
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,120
and my idea of gettingit all back by charging 100 bucks for a piece of cake...

139
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,500
went right out the window when fat Frank decided to go on that power diet.

140
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,100
I lost over 230 pounds so far.

141
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,410
I don't know why he keeps wearing those pants.

142
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,790
All right. Fair enough.

143
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,870
Now I got your little budget reports. You don't know who to fire, do ya?

144
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,530
Fine. Keep'em. You do it.

145
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,260
Watch and learn. I'll do it, and I'll do it without firing a single person.

146
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,100
I have to fire someone.

147
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,780
I can't believe you left me all alone for a stupid tv writer!

148
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,540
Oh, like that is any different from the time you spent all night hanging out with your favorite weatherman from channel 4.

149
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,200
The man had a massive heart attack. I was nothing but professional.

150
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,380
Ok, he's stable! Just take the picture, Carla!

151
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,080
What do you want me to do?

152
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,480
I want you to go in there and tell Mr. James that there's absolutely no reason for him to be up here.

153
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,440
Mr. James, how long have you had that cough?

154
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,970
Oh, a couple months now.

155
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,160
Am I wrong, Elliot, or is that the kind of cough that needs a chest x-ray?

156
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,050
Probably.

157
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:16,920
Thank you.

158
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,250
Hey, yo, Turk!

159
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:20,950
What's up?

160
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,380
I got a break. You wanna play some ball?

161
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,940
Definitely.

162
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,850
Baby. Yeah, I'm not gonna be able to make our next appointment kiss.

163
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,390
I'm swamped, too. Yeah. Right now I'm helping dr. Schwartz reset a patient's leg.

164
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,410
Oh. I think you got it, dr. Schwartz.

165
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,640
You're a liar!

166
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,170
Oh, for god's sake, Perry,

167
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,240
adjust your bra, man up, and fire the one with the least pathetic story.

168
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,190
Do you really think I know any of these people's stories?

169
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,590
Well, let me fill you in.

170
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,160
First we have Hank. 4 kids. Trying to make it on a dishwasher's salary.

171
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,740
Next to him is mike. Lost half his leg in a motorcycle accident.

172
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,420
And then there's Judy. Been here 30 years. Just 2 away from retirement.

173
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,980
You're... you're friends with all these people?

174
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,120
Are you kidding me? I read their files.

175
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,120
I read everybody's files... Ms. Manic-depressive, Dr. Drinks-a-lot.

176
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,610
Hold your horses!

177
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,040
Just... tell me who the last person hired was, would you, please?

178
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,070
Looks like you folks could use a little refresher.

179
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,080
Servin' people like you who save lives every day...

180
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,460
makes me happier than a kitten chasin' a leaky cow.

181
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,120
God bless ya, huh? God bless ya.

182
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,490
I have to fire Opie, don't I?

183
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,710
Ya think?

184
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,550
Metastatic lung cancer?

185
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,160
How was he even walking around with this?

186
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,000
At worst, I thought maybe he had a bad case of bronchitis.

187
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,330
This is gonna suck.

188
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,190
Why'd they move me up here?

189
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,930
Uh, Mr. James, I'm not quite sure how to say this, but you have lung cancer.

190
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,360
It was strange telling mr. James he may only have a few weeks to live...

191
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,690
when just a few short hours ago, we all thought he was fine.

192
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,950
It made me realize something.

193
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,590
Whether it was giving bad news to a patient...

194
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,440
or realizing your relationship may not be as stable as you thought...

195
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,590
We couldn't even make it one day.

196
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,260
or having to do someone else's dirty work for them...

197
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,060
Say, Kenny? Can I talk to you for a second?

198
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,400
There are moments when we all wish life was more like a sitcom.

199
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,060
I'm  so sorry.

200
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,810
I'm sorry, too, sir.

201
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,440
Well,  the good news is I won't have to eat my wife's cooking anymore, right?

202
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,750
J.D.'S sitcom fantasy will be back after these messages.

203
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,650
J.D.'S sitcom fantasy is filmed in front of a live studio audience.

204
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,410
It's weird. There's just so many things I never got to do in my life,

205
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,190
like go to a carnival or take a ride in a hot-air balloon.

206
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,330
We can do all that. We are gonna give you the best day ever.

207
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,370
Elliot, a word?

208
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,660
A hot-air balloon seems kind of dangerous. I mean, he could get hurt.

209
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,270
What's he gonna do, bruise one of his giant malignant tumors?

210
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,790
Safety is always important, Elliot.

211
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,100
Oh, my god. You're afraid of balloon rides, aren't you?

212
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,640
It's floating wicker propelled by fire!

213
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,310
Beside, I defy you to find one other thing that I'm afraid of.

214
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,280
Moppin' time, moppin' time.

215
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,500
It's moppin' time.

216
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,130
There he is.

217
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
Yes, it's mopping time, my friend, and as you know,

218
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,580
I always like to start in the exact spot you're standing.

219
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,780
Let's get to work. Here we go.

220
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,670
Is that my new sweater?

221
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,200
No. This is my new sweater mop.

222
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,920
It went dynamite with my beige cords.

223
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,460
You mean my beige cord sponge?

224
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,440
You... you wanted to see me?

225
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,910
Hell,  yeah, I wanted to see you. I wanted to tell you that I...

226
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,550
I think you're doin' a great job.

227
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,230
Boy, that meatloaf today was... it was virtually hairless.

228
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,620
I took off the gloves, and... it makes the hair a lot easier to pick out.

229
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,090
Get out of here.

230
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,070
Perry, why the hell is he still here?

231
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,750
When I go back down to the cafeteria, there had better be only 3 workers there.

232
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,700
Unless Margaret spits out another kid. That woman's like a catholic bunny.

233
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,700
Get it done.

234
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,090
Why? Why am I having such a hard time with this?

235
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,350
Because apparently you have girl parts.

236
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:22,470
Kelso said that if we can cover his salary in the budget that Kenny can stay.

237
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,620
But where are we gonna come up with $26,372?

238
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,060
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

239
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,540
Yeah.

240
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,320
That we invite muscles here to hang a banner in our bedroom that says "it takes 3 to party"?

241
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,040
All right. Knuckleheads. I need one of you to win this talent show.

242
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,040
I can do Shakespeare in German!

243
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,510
In college, I double-majored in theater and classic languages.

244
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,950
Does that degree come with headgear and allergies?

245
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,130
Let's take a look at our other options. Gandhi...

246
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,720
you appear to be a man who is utterly without talent,

247
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,330
unless of course you wanna count the fact that you are the 20th-best basketball player...

248
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,180
in a predominantly white hospital.

249
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,440
Jordan, your only skill is illegal in 26 states.

250
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,440
It's 27. Arkansas buckled.

251
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,100
Carla...that makes you my girl.

252
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,630
Hell, we could crank up the humidity and watch your hair explode. That'd be terrific.

253
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,760
Which leaves me, and...

254
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,880
unless all of you wanna see me turn a 2-syllable word into a 6-syllable word,

255
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,340
I rehe-rehe-rehe-ally think...

256
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,490
that we should keep looking.

257
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,280
Newbie! I almost forgot about you.

258
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,990
You know what? Save your breath.

259
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,880
I'm about to get in a hot-air balloon and get evil knievel on my own ass.

260
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,340
Come on, Elliot.

261
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,340
Let's go french-kiss the sun.

262
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,300
You know, you're wrong about Turk. He has many, many talents.

263
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,600
Yeah, he's really good at not finding 5 seconds to kiss his wife.

264
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,160
Wow!That's interesting because you're really good at that, too.

265
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,300
Oh, really?

266
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,140
- Really.
- Really?

267
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:13,730
Really!

268
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,950
Because at least I can remember how long we've been married or what our song is.

269
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,200
I don't know the name of it, but I know it goes like this:

270
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,420
Are you humming the let's all go to the movies song?

271
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,450
Is that not our song?

272
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,450
It's sung by hot dogs.

273
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,690
What an amazing day!

274
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:42,200
A balloon ride, lunch by the beach, and my first carnival.

275
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,670
Yeah. Sorry you missed out on getting your face painted.

276
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,470
Well, they only had time to paint one more face, so I let the kid behind me go...

277
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,840
to make him stop crying.

278
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,150
That was awesome!

279
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,480
Spider-girl...

280
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,170
All right, talent show's about to start.

281
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,980
Talent show? I'd love to see it, but I'm too tired to get out of bed.

282
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,540
That sucks for you!

283
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,870
I'm just kidding! We're gonna do it right here!

284
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,430
O Romeo, Romeo...

285
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,960
Waurm bist du romeo?
...

286
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,750
Gesundheit.

287
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,340
Hey, I'm wonderin', what's the story with steel wool?

288
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,520
I mean, is it steel, or is it wool?

289
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,860
Make up your mind, steel wool.

290
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,600
Are there iron sheep hoppin' around Scotland?

291
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,420
Oh, brother.

292
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,310
Look, I... I... either start laughing or I start unplugging your machines.

293
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,220
And if any of you cows, goats, or ducks have any questions,

294
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,540
don't be afraid to ask me.

295
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,210
I'm just like all of you, only giant and human.

296
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,730
Thank you. I hope you enjoyed our production of world's most giant doctor goes to the farm.

297
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,130
So, what did we end up going with?

298
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,470
Oh, you went with the farm idea.

299
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,870
Oh, my god, we're doomed.

300
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:34,280
Ok, Perry, that's it. It's over.The only act left to see is you firing that guy.

301
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,420
Wait, wait. There's one more contestant.

302
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,540
Oh no. Is that Kenny?

303
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,050
Hi. I'm Kenny.

304
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,070
Yeah, it is.

305
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,200
Hey, that... that's our song.

306
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,970
Yeah, I know. I told him to sing it.

307
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,030
All right, now, Bobbo, you give it to him. You know he deserves it.

308
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,850
The winner.

309
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,740
Thatta boy!

310
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,520
Uh, Turk and I are gonna go home and spend some time together.

311
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,200
Some good time.

312
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,940
And by good time, she means bumpin' uglies.

313
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,490
Well, I hope you had a good day, Mr. James.

314
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,340
Wait a second!

315
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:56,710
This chart isn't for Charles James. It's for James Charles.

316
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,080
He's the one who has cancer, not you.

317
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,230
And who cares about him?
He's anti-semitic!

318
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,840
Well, that's a load off my mind.

319
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,340
Hey, everybody!

320
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,310
Thanks for coming so quickly.

321
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,710
You know, this is the kind of thing I normally say out loud in my head, but since we're all here...

322
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,370
It just seems like in the end, everything always works out because as long as we--

323
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,420
Mr. James?

324
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,420
Mr. James, can you hear me?

325
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,540
He's apneic! We need an airway! Call anesthesia!

326
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,540
Wait, this isn't right.

327
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,810
We're gonna entubate. Hang some dopamine, wide open!

328
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,120
I need an E.T. Tube. Where's anesthesia?

329
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,270
Unfortunately, around here things don't always end as neat and tidy as they do in sitcoms.

330
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,030
Relationships aren't always magically fixed in 30 minutes. You have to work on them.

331
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,050
Problems don't always have easy solutions.

332
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,030
Hey, Kenny, once again, I'm... I'm real sorry.

333
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,950
Welcome to my world. Now imagine going home to my wife.

334
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And around here, nice people don't always get better.

335
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,950
And at times like that, it's comforting to know there's always one thing that can pick your spirits up.
