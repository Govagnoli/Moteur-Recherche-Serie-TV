1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,180
I can't stop thinking about last night.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,840
I mean, it's incredible how fast things 
can go from amazing...

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,580
...to complete disaster.

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:12,770
SEAN?

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,770
I have been looking all over for you!

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,990
What are you doing back from New Zealand?

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,350
Morning.

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,680
What's up with him?

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,990
He slept with Elliot last night.

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,880
Is it that time of year again?

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,110
Dude, ignore her.

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,590
That's three years in a row... 
who's feeling you?

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,050
You be.

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,050
She's already back with Sean.

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,400
How soon after you guys hooked up?

16
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,700
About ninety seconds.

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,600
What should I do?

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,170
That was a huge mistake.

19
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,470
Because the closer Turk and Carla 
got to their wedding,

20
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,470
the more they became one of those 
annoying couples...

21
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,740
that thought they knew everything 
about relationships.

22
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,630
Look, J.D....

23
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,360
You first, honey.

24
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,040
J.D., love is like a butterfly.

25
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,050
Hold it too tight and... 
you'll crush it.

26
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,880
Too loose and it flies away.

27
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,910
The phone call was Elliot asking me 
to meet her so we could talk.

28
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:18,990
I was nervous,

29
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,310
but I felt better the moment 
I saw good old Irv at the security gate.

30
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,280
Irrrrrv!

31
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,140
Howdy, Dr. Dorian.

32
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:40,830
I'm sorry, sir.

33
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,710
But there's no parking allowed...

34
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,040
at the emergency curb.

35
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,330
But I'd be happy to park your car for ya,

36
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,970
and run the keys up to you in a jiff.

37
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,210
Yeah.... 
Except this is my only set?

38
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,380
And I'm afraid you might eat them. 
Okay? See ya, tubs.

39
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,190
I've been trying like the dickens 
to cut down on my snacking,

40
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,570
but it's just so...

41
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,300
You look great, Irv!

42
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,540
Irv didn't look great, 
but I didn't have time to talk.

43
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,100
Danni!?

44
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,090
When you run into someone 
you used to date,

45
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,040
either you find them totally annoying 
or enough time has passed...

46
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,860
that you've idealized everything about them.

47
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,830
Hey, J.D.

48
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,350
"Hey, Jay-Dee!"

49
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,840
I'm actually on my way to see somebody, 
so, you know....

50
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,200
Oh, okay. I'll see you later.

51
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,270
Oh, be nice.

52
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,070
Danni, wait!

53
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,520
How've you been?

54
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,190
Well, actually, I...

55
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,850
Gotta go!

56
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,150
And there she was... my lady.

57
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,140
Hey, Elliot.

58
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,700
J.D., I can't talk right now.

59
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,700
Should we just hold each other?

60
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,550
Sorry! Sorry! 
I couldn't find a parking spot!

61
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,730
Hey, J.D. What's up?

62
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,500
What's up....

63
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,570
Attention, Sacred Heart!

64
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,810
Everyone please gather'round.

65
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,130
Doctors, nurses, patients, 
hear ye, hear ye.

66
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,700
Everyone should know that last night,

67
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,260
Elliot Reid and I made passionate love 
for a good hour and a half.

68
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,000
Check that! A great hour and a half.

69
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,020
When I hit it, I hit it good! 
That is all!

70
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,570
Aww, Bambi freeze up again?

71
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,050
It's not our problem, honey.

72
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,870

74
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,400
You've got something on your face.

75
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,010
What?

76
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,170
The love of my life.

77
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,000
You got it.

78
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,450
So, I'll see you after work.

79
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,740
'Kay.

80
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,230
Bye, J.D.

81
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,530
Peace out, Sean.

82
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,780
Listen, J.D....

83
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,050
Last night was really important to me.

84
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,410
I know.

85
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,550
I mean, you don't want to be rusty at sex...

86
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,100
before you throw down 
with your real boyfriend, do ya?

87
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,050
Look, you and I have been down this road before 
and we both know where it ends.

88
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,470
I'm sorry. I just... 
I really want to make this work with Sean.

89
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,300
So, please don't say anything to him? 
Okay?

90
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,640
I totally understand. You know,

91
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,970
Danni and I are getting back together, too.

92
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,870
We are?

93
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,860
Danni? Danni, Danni, Danni....

94
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,290
What was her last name?

95
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,920
Damn! I should know this!

96
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:17,900
Blonde hair!

97
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,110
Yes! Raspy voice!

98
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,960
Oh, yeah. 
That incision's healing up nicely.

99
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,030
Thanks again, Dr. Miller.

100
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,790
I'm gonna have my band write a song about you.

101
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,030
Well, I'm glad I struck a chord!

102
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,650
Yeah, listen: 
While you were proving once and for all...

103
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,930
that pretty girls do not in fact need to be funny,

104
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,400
I went ahead and took a look 
at your little rock star's chart.

105
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,270
Oh, didja?

106
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,980
Yes, I did. And his urine output is dropping,

107
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,840
so you should probably start him on Lasix.

108
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,040
You amuse me.

109
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,050
So even though he's post-op 
and still technically my patient,

110
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,380
I'm gonna pretend to consider your opinion 
before I walk away and do whatever I want!

111
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,170
Hmm. No!

112
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,040
Are you all right?

113
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,500
Some hooligan keeps disconnecting the alarm.

114
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,730
I told Security to look into it?

115
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,230
But no, no,

116
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,000
they'd rather catch the guy 
who's stealing organs from the transplant ward.

117
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,300
If I was a security guard around here, 
things'd be different.

118
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,160
You really want to be a security guard?

119
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,950
Who around here commands more respect...

120
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,950
than the men who wear blue and green?

121
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,950
The uniforms are black and gray.

122
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,550
You got me. 
I don't see colors well. Happy now?

123
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,250
Look, if you're really into Security, 
Irv's position just opened up!

124
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,530
What happened to Irv?

125
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,820
Tubs?

126
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,440
Who's tubby now!?!?!

127
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,610
Stop him!

128
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,110
He had to be let go.

129
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,050
Okay, Elliot really hurt me.

130
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,420
Still, right now I need to keep a level head.

131
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,930
My emotions are all over the place, 
and it's important that I don't do anything rash.

132
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,120
Do you have to do that here?

133
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,580
What? I like smoking after sex.

134
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,750
And during. God, you never used to smoke!

135
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,210
Yeah, but back then I was pretending to be someone
I thought you wanted me to be,

136
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,580
and that didn't work. So now....

137
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,270
...I'm gonna let the real me come out.

138
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,160
And the real me wants to do it again... 
and she wants to do it rough!

139
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,010
Oh, I don't know, Danni. 
The real me's not really into that.

140
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,280
GIVE IT TO ME!

141
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,250
Oh, my God, Danni, I am so sorry. 
I thought that's what you wanted.

142
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,230
It was.

143
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,230
Quick question: Will my son ever stop crying?

144
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,770
You know what's so sweet?

145
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,110
This morning, Jack called her "Da-Da".

146
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,460
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

147
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,820
Look, there's a new doctor at the hospital,

148
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,520
and she is such a relentless chore 
that every time she's harping at me,

149
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,400
I actually see your face.

150
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,160
I love that you think about me at work!

151
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,140
Honestly, Jordan, 
I have never despised anyone more.

152
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,820
Oh, my God. You have a crush on her.

153
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,240
Who said who to what now?

154
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,200
It is so typical.

155
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,880
We have an amazing son, 
we're totally getting along for a change...

156
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,990
but that's too boring for you; it's too nice!

157
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,290
So you have to go and blow the whole thing up, 
don't you?

158
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,940
Well, bravo, Perry.

159
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,320
Ohh...fantastic!

160
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,770
Now, I know you say you love us all equally.

161
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,920
But you don't, do ya.
I'm onto you, Big Man!

162
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,840
Okay. This badge is now yours.

163
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,560
I just want to thank you for believing in me.

164
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,080
And I want to assure you that I am
gonna be guarding these hospital gates

165
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,080
the way Cerberus guarded the gates of Hell!

166
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,800
Yeah, that's terrific.

167
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,740
Look at you in your new uniform!
And they give you a nightstick!

168
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,450
Well, actually, this is my dad's.

169
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,350
He used to use this baby every day at work.

170
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,410
Was he a cop?

171
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,880
Uh, no, cat trainer.

172
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,940
That way!

173
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,000
You stay here! I'll go!

174
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,200
I felt bad about hooking up with Danni.
But luckily no one knew.

175
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,140
You want any water?

176
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,080
Well, do you guys?

177
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,310
Bambi!

178
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,290
We know you were in there with Danni.
We heard you say her name!

179
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,970
Oh, no, no. I was...

180
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,620
I was in there with my buddy Danny,
from the gym.

181
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,190
But we heard you say "Take it all, Danni!"

182
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,240
He's a... really... good... buddy.

183
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,530
Moving a little quick there, aren't we, bub?

184
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,210
Got a story to tell me?

185
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,790
Here's a story :

186
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,470
It's called The Security Guard Who Was
Sodomized With His Own Nightstick.

187
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,720
Why don't we just consider this a warning.

188
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,280
Yeah.

189
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,810
My cousin is a bank teller,

190
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,150
and he gave me one of those exploding ink cartridges...

191
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,460
they put in stolen money so I could figure out...

192
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,900
who's been disconnecting the emergency exits!

193
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,080
Nice work.

194
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,370
Okay, that's all from me, Jeff.

195
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,050
Any other questions you might have
you can direct to Dr. Cox, here.

196
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,420
I'm sure you'll find him
to be quite... something!

197
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,770
You think it's cool if I broke out tomorrow
and play a set with the band?

198
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,570
They're going on tour in Europe and...

199
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,740
I won't get a chance to play with them for a whole year.

200
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,380
I think we can work something out.

201
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,040
Don't worry about it. 
I will drive him out there myself,

202
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,090
he can play with his friends for an hour, 
and then I'll drive him back.

203
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,370
I won't worry about it. 
Mostly because he's not going.

204
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,800
You see, I'm his doctor now.

205
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,880
I didn't listen to you before, 
so now you're gonna take it out on the patient.

206
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,930
Look, I honestly don't think that going to some...

207
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,830
dive bar is necessarily appropriate for somebody 
who just had kidney surgery.

208
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,380
Although, don't get me wrong, 
the fact that it seems to be pissing you off...

209
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,680
so much is the true definition of an added perk. 
Seriously, you can...

210
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,780
you can look it up in the dictionary. 
It's under "P" for "perk".

211
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,730
It's right next to "pain in the ass" and,

212
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,830
curiously enough, 
your picture is right next to it.

213
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,010
Bambi, when you broke up with Danni,

214
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,960
you said it was the happiest day of your life!

215
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,020
No, that was only because
'Barney Miller' came out on DVD.

216
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,850
And WoJo's commentary on it? Priceless!

217
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,790
Look, maybe Danni's not the love of my life, 
all right?

218
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,660
But she's... she's beautiful, and she quirky,
and she's very... sweet.

219
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,250
Man, I get so gassy after having sex.

220
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,020
Oh, by the way, some skank named Barbara called,
and I told her to back off.

221
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,680
Barbara's my mom.

222
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,910
In life, there are personal realizations....

223
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,650
I hate my girlfriend.

224
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,730
....and professional ones.

225
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,870
Listen, Serpico,

226
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,360
I go four steps out that door to my car every day.

227
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,150
And that's important,
because if I don't beat Enid home from her thighs & buns class,

228
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,820
I have to help her peel off her leotard.

229
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,130
So remember this : I hired you,
and I can fire you.

230
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,520
But the worst are the realizations
that sneak up on you.

231
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,400
Excuse me, I need to get a, uh...

232
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Book about supply closet etiquette?
Yeah, look, I'm kinda using this area?

233
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,070
Oh, oh, you are so annoying;
you must drive your wife insane...

234
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,700
Are you married?

235
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,190
Like when you realize
you just might have a crush after all.

236
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,530
No, no I'm not.

237
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,090
In a big hospital, 
you can hide from almost anything.

238
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,190
Except your conscience.

239
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,180
- Hello.
- Oh, hey! Hey, Jordan!

240
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,470
You know what's weird?

241
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,610
Tell me.

242
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,970
We're so close, 
and yet if anybody asks if we're married,

243
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,540
all either one of us can say is... is no.

244
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,740
Actually, I say we were married 
for five years then got divorced,

245
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,240
now we're back living together, have a child, 
but we're in a long-term, committed relationship.

246
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,440
Yeah, that's what I say, too.... 
That or...

247
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,620
no.

248
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,270
Oh, Mr. Mid-life.

249
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,940
We both know what this is about.

250
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,490
And you should just go ahead 
and enjoy your crush!

251
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,640
Because, honestly, I don't care.

252
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,820
I don't!

253
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,710
That's sad.

254
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,550
Hey, Q-Tip!

255
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,290
Some girl who says she's your girlfriend
 is on the phone!

256
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,200
Oh, uh, tell her I'm not here.

257
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,060
Godspeed, sir.

258
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,610
What? I'm in a pickle!

259
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,390
A pickle!

260
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,940
Hey, you wanna play darts?

261
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,830
- Sure!
- Great! Have fun, I'll be over here.

262
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,690
Do you even enjoy spending time with me?

263
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,810
"Enjoy" is such a strong word.... I...

264
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,230
I'm used to it. 
You know, like cafeteria food,

265
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,310
or the constant threat of terrorism.

266
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,130
What, you don't enjoy hanging out with me, do you?

267
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,730
Not really. 
I'm more into tough guys, you know?

268
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,200
Last night in bed, I knocked you unconscious!

269
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,750
For like five seconds!

270
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,990
So I guess... this is over.

271
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,030
Why?

272
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,750
So, you'd rather hang out with someone 
you don't even like than be alone?

273
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,310
Yeah, pretty much.

274
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,450
Yeah, me too.

275
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,870
I mean, come on, how many couples out there
actually have fun together?

276
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,170
Guys! Elliot and I are in the middle
of a marathon game of Hide & Go Seek.

277
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,460
If she comes in, you didn't see me!

278
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,520
Ninety-nine! One hundred!

279
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,370
Have you guys seen Sean?

280
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,170
Yeah, he's...

281
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,420
Where'd he go?

282
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,540
Aw, he's a dynamite hider.

283
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,060
Oh, don't even start, Tarla, or Curk,

284
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,060
or whatever you're calling
this little two-headed judgmental freak-show.

285
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,590
Why don't I do a little piece for you
I like to call...

286
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,000
Your First Year of Marriage:

287
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,450
"I do." Oh, kiss, kiss, kiss. 
"Why can't we have a baby?"

288
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,440
"Why you spending so much money on clothes?"

289
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,890
"Why you sleeping with my sister?"

290
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,340
"Why can't I hang out with my peeps?"

291
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,930
Baby.

292
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,180
I would never sleep with your sister. 
She's hideous.

293
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,580
And I would never have a crush on someone else.

294
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,600
I do not have a crush.

295
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,350
What is this?

296
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,990
That is a form allowing Mr. Stockton's band
to come visit him...

297
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,580
so that Dr. Miller will be happy 
that I did a nice thing for her.

298
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,580
Turk, he wants to be with Dr. Miller 
because he thinks it'll make him what?

299
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,010
- Happy.
- Exactly.

300
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,970
But he's really only happy when he's...?

301
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,160
- Miserable.
- Right!

302
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,080
So why does he really want to be with Dr. Miller?

303
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,670
'Cause she got big-ass boobies!

304
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,060
No, no, no. Because he likes being miserable.

305
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,090
If I actually enjoyed being miserable,

306
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,380
then why wouldn't I stay here talking to you two?

307
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,600
Okay, let's see how Elliot likes it
when I'm all over my lady?

308
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,330
Hey, I've got something for you.

309
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,400
What?

310
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,250
Okay, I'm gonna buy the next round.

311
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,160
Which one of you handsome boys
wanna help me carry it?

312
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,130
We're both good-looking guys, am I right?

313
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,380
We'll sort this out when I get back!

314
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,450
Okay, sort away, Seany-Sean-Sean!

315
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,430
Oh, my God!

316
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,740
How could you do this to me?

317
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,980
Do...what?

318
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,450
Ohh, I don't know! Come over my house,

319
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,250
sleep with me,
and then dump me the minute Sean shows up...

320
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,270
so I feel like a complete loser!

321
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,750
Oh, you seem real crushed!

322
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,850
I mean, you jumped into bed with Danni so quick
you didn't have time to change the sheets!

323
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,450
You know I only have one set.

324
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,270
Look, J.D., can I ask you a favor?

325
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,320
Could I ask you one?

326
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,730
Sure, anything. What is it?

327
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,630
Damn, I don't have one.

328
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,030
Didn't have one, did ya?

329
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,610
Look, Elliot! What do you want!?

330
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,920
How about you remembering
that you're supposed to be my friend?

331
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,980
Why'd you page me? What do you want?

332
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,700
Just, uh...just watch his face.

333
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,060
No way.

334
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,730
- How you feeling? 
- Hey, Rick!

335
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,770
Audrey! Ryan! Tim! Jamie! Tobey!

336
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,920
Hey, Jeff!

337
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,700
Joe!

338
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,730
I hope this won't be awkward for ya,

339
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,710
but I promised the whole band
you'd have sex with them.

340
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,890
Don't look at me like that!
This is your fault, anyway!

341
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,420
You two made me dream again.

342
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,950
Hey, we weren't the ones who caved in to Kelso.

343
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,980
I do not owe you an explanation for that!

344
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,980
You're right, you don't owe us an explanation!

345
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,400
Lay some truth on him, baby!

346
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,860
You owe one to yourself.

347
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,550
Ouch.

348
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,460
Now I'm gonna let my husband-to-be tell you
what life's really all about,

349
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,720
because he has more of this than any man I know.

350
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:07,600
Archie comics?

351
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,400
No, the other thing.

352
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,960
Oh, that's right... integrity.

353
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,980
Oh. Here's your chance!

354
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,130
I was so mad at Elliot I couldn't sleep last night.

355
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,350
Also, Danni snores like a gutted wild boar.

356
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,000
But mostly it was the Elliot thing.

357
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,500
Hey, J.D. Can I talk to you for a sec?

358
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,460
Look, things have been a little weird
between Elliot and I since I got back.

359
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,520
Good.

360
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,790
J.D., listen.

361
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,960
Did anything happen between
you and Elliot while I was gone?

362
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,370
Sorry, everybody. False alarm.

363
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,180
Well?

364
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,130
There comes a time when every man
has to make a choice.

365
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,810
Whether it's a professional choice...

366
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,980
Come on! What are you gonna do about it?

367
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,200
Or whether it's a personal choice.

368
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,650
Hey. Wanna go for a beer after the show?

369
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,180
In the end, it's about integrity.

370
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,310
Yes!

371
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,370
- No!
- No!

372
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,560
And it's about chasing after what
you really want.

373
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,280
Here's your beer.

374
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,150
Even if that means showing you
both care a little.

375
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,260
Did you... did you do that for me?

376
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,270
I thought it'd be fun.

377
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,750
See, now there are two blondes
you can't have sex with!

378
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,820
I don't care!
It is so naughty!

379
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,980
Cheers.

380
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,210
And sometimes...

381
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,510
well, sometimes you just have to do
what's right for your friend.

382
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,950
No. Sean, nothing happened.

383
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,800
Yeah, I figured.

384
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,660
Good talk!

385
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,240
Even if it means sacrificing
your own happiness.

386
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,740
Giddyup, Dr. Dorkian!

387
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:21,560
When it comes down to it,
you just have to be proud of the decision you make.
