1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,466
Look, Carol, I know you think you look
dashing in your navy blue scrubs,

2
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:09,887
but I can't deal with the fact that
I walk into the front door of this place

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,090
and I find you standing there taaaalking at me.

4
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:13,478
All I said was "good morning".

5
00:00:13,582 --> 00:00:17,558
Exactly! And who in God's name
wants to hear that every day?!

6
00:00:17,758 --> 00:00:21,092
"Good morning." In the immortal words of Daffy Duck:

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,806
I demand that you shoot me now.

8
00:00:23,798 --> 00:00:24,547
If only.

9
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:27,694
I couldn't help but think two things.

10
00:00:27,883 --> 00:00:30,046
First, I do look stunning in these navy scrubs --

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,928
I mean, come on, who wants a taste?

12
00:00:32,052 --> 00:00:34,687
Second, everyone's day begins
differently around here.

13
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:38,997
The surgeons for instance are
the most superstitious bunch.

14
00:00:39,262 --> 00:00:40,440
So they always start their mornings

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,998
with an oddly homo-erotic ass slap...

16
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:44,106
Dude! Too deep!

17
00:00:44,882 --> 00:00:46,719
...and then their own personal
good luck rituals.

18
00:00:54,599 --> 00:00:57,736
Ohhh, where's my lucky Tabasco 'do-rag!?

19
00:00:58,223 --> 00:00:59,765
Why don't you just use Power Rangers?

20
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,249
How are Power Rangers as lucky as Tabasco?

21
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,451
You remember when communications with Zordon

22
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:06,648
went down and 
the Megazord was destroyed?

23
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:08,087
How did I miss that episode?

24
00:01:08,506 --> 00:01:10,272
Ohh, that's right --
I was making love to a woman.

25
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:13,770
Power Rangers, hoooaaa!

26
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:19,025
All you can really hope is
that nothing bites you on the ass.

27
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:21,860
Gaby, you all set for your
bone marrow transplant today?

28
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,836
I'm scared. I wanted to bring
my stuffed pink doggie with me,

29
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:27,884
but Mean Nurse says I can't.

30
00:01:28,315 --> 00:01:30,251
Well, I promise you you'll have it.

31
00:01:31,516 --> 00:01:34,425
Honestly, Mean Nurse, 
why would you say that?

32
00:01:34,964 --> 00:01:37,643
Because she lost her stuffed
pink doggie two days ago.

33
00:01:39,338 --> 00:01:39,935
Frick!

34
00:01:45,776 --> 00:01:47,504
Since I been wearing
that Tabasco 'do-rag,

35
00:01:47,627 --> 00:01:49,777
my surgery record's like 23 and 0.

36
00:01:50,419 --> 00:01:52,139
Are you counting
the boil you lanced yesterday?

37
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,131
Question: Did he die?
Answer: No, he did not.

38
00:01:55,327 --> 00:01:57,181
The point is, I gotta stick
with whatever's hot.

39
00:01:57,348 --> 00:01:59,239
Like last month, it was
not wearing any underwear.

40
00:01:59,635 --> 00:02:01,700
So why don't you just
take off your underwear?

41
00:02:02,185 --> 00:02:03,274
That's what I keep telling him!

42
00:02:04,105 --> 00:02:05,325
Todd knows about the underwear thing?

43
00:02:05,605 --> 00:02:05,964
No.

44
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:09,194
Oh, yeah.

45
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:13,789
Look, the 'do-rag still
has the juice, okay?

46
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:15,938
I mean, can you imagine 
what could happen without it?

47
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:18,531
I can't find any kind of obstruction!

48
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,533
Keep looking. It must be there!

49
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:27,691
I felt it!

50
00:02:31,964 --> 00:02:33,337
Powerful, tiny fists....

51
00:02:34,265 --> 00:02:35,546
Hm!

52
00:02:36,246 --> 00:02:36,938
He's back.

53
00:02:54,806 --> 00:02:57,412
Some people say everything
comes down to luck....

54
00:02:57,662 --> 00:02:58,635
I need my lucky 'do-rag!

55
00:03:00,655 --> 00:03:02,571
What I believe is that the most minor event --

56
00:03:02,817 --> 00:03:04,554
even a butterfly flapping its wings --

57
00:03:04,954 --> 00:03:06,509
can affect everything.

58
00:03:15,678 --> 00:03:16,338
Hillside landing.

59
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:20,175
Because once that seemingly
insignificant event happens...

60
00:03:20,604 --> 00:03:21,476
What is wrong with you!?

61
00:03:23,138 --> 00:03:25,851
Baby, I wasn't looking at her lovelies. Okay?

62
00:03:25,942 --> 00:03:27,822
I was looking at the butterfly
that just happened

63
00:03:27,891 --> 00:03:30,987
to land on her lovelies.
And who could blame it?

64
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:34,870
There they are, all snuggly
and safe and whatnot....

65
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:37,510
...It sets everything else in motion.

66
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,057
Uncomfortable!

67
00:03:47,597 --> 00:03:48,545
Okay, who do I kill?

68
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,750
She did it!

69
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:53,249
Man, I don't wanna clean this up!

70
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:55,072
Well, then, I think you picked

71
00:03:55,162 --> 00:03:56,275
the wrong day to be the janitor.

72
00:03:58,798 --> 00:04:00,244
Janitor? Could you help me find

73
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:01,347
a little girl's pink stuffed doggie?

74
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:02,753
I would love to, Darlin', but I'm

75
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:03,739
a little bit busy right now.

76
00:04:05,964 --> 00:04:08,175
And insignificant events 
can lead to significant events.

77
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:11,262
Like me being on time and 
Dr. Cox being late for a change.

78
00:04:11,662 --> 00:04:13,492
Where the hell is Dr. Cox?

79
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,353
His shift started four minutes ago!

80
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:17,026
Uh-oh. You've gotta cover for him.

81
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,619
Have to learn to play the banjo.

82
00:04:35,964 --> 00:04:37,166
Dammit, son, are you listening to me?

83
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,966
Yes, sir!

84
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:39,277
And buy a banjo.

85
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:41,453
Hey, fellas. What'd I miss?

86
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,965
And here he is!

87
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,365
Goodness gracious.

88
00:04:44,772 --> 00:04:46,679
Suddenly I'm getting the most intense headache.

89
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,633
Better. Worse. Better. Worse.

90
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:54,916
I could do this all day!

91
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:56,363
You know, Perry, since Dr. Dorian was on time

92
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,302
and you were busy in the break room coming up

93
00:04:58,413 --> 00:04:59,666
with that hilarious "better-worse" bit, maybe

94
00:05:00,524 --> 00:05:01,759
you should answer to him all day.

95
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:04,494
Uh, Dr. Kelso? That's my pen.

96
00:05:05,825 --> 00:05:07,379
Nice grab.

97
00:05:07,746 --> 00:05:08,364
Well, I'm a lefty.

98
00:05:09,121 --> 00:05:10,212
You know, my head's probably going to melt

99
00:05:10,315 --> 00:05:13,108
when I say this but Kelso's idea wasn't half bad.

100
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:15,030
Letting you run this place for a day

101
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:16,745
would be a great educational experience.

102
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,350
And, come on, let's face facts -- the training bra's

103
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:24,773
got to come off eventually. So, it's your show, Debbie.

104
00:05:25,148 --> 00:05:28,822
Is this moment just the way you always pictured it?

105
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:32,372
It's your show, Debbie. Is this moment just

106
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,721
like you always pictured?

107
00:05:36,318 --> 00:05:37,946
Stupid homemade dolls....

108
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:40,845
It's a little bigger...?

109
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:41,954
Ehhhhh.

110
00:05:43,073 --> 00:05:45,901
Turk, I just got off of a 12-hour shift.

111
00:05:46,035 --> 00:05:47,215
I'm starving and I have yet to take

112
00:05:47,406 --> 00:05:48,830
a single bathroom break -- which, by the way,

113
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:50,672
is why I'm dancing a little -- and you want me

114
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,768
to run home, search through your nasties,

115
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:54,811
and bring back your lucky 'do-rag?

116
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,093
And if you could be back in twenty minutes

117
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:56,640
that'd be great.

118
00:05:57,311 --> 00:05:59,672
Nurse Espinosa, your shift ended nine minutes ago.

119
00:05:59,748 --> 00:06:01,321
How is it that your time card isn't punched out?

120
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:02,807
Well, sir, I--

121
00:06:02,914 --> 00:06:05,334
Dr. Kelso, how is it that you had an ambulance

122
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:07,391
take you to your dinner reservation last night

123
00:06:07,488 --> 00:06:08,854
just so you wouldn't lose it?

124
00:06:09,463 --> 00:06:10,391
How do you know that?

125
00:06:10,714 --> 00:06:12,797
Because I'm the "homeboy" you screamed at to get my

126
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,106
"ghettomobile" off the road.

127
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,025
Turk! I don't need you to fight my battles for me.

128
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:25,235
It makes me look like I can't defend myself!

129
00:06:25,922 --> 00:06:31,257
You're absolutely right, baby. 
And I apologize! Remember! 'Do-rag!

130
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:40,133
Huh!

131
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:46,777
Hello?

132
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:48,313
Hey, it's Elliot. What are you doing?

133
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,667
Nothing disgusting.

134
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:53,348
I can't find that girl's little pink doggie anywhere.

135
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,133
I got a pink doggie for you -- but it is not little.

136
00:06:57,636 --> 00:06:59,936
Okay, if you show me your penis,
 I'm gonna take it away from you.

137
00:07:00,781 --> 00:07:01,440
Cool.

138
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:03,768
Yeah, that was Todd.

139
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:06,965
Don't worry about the doggie. I'll be right there.

140
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,698
Basically, I've had nausea and 
stomach pains for a couple of days now.

141
00:07:18,118 --> 00:07:20,144
Mr. Strauss, I don't wanna tell you how to live your life,

142
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,841
but maybe you should avoid 
eating sushi from the Gas 'n' Go.

143
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,161
It came free with the fill-up! 
What am I supposed to do,

144
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:26,992
just throw it away?

145
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:29,717
Yes. Yes, you are. Fortunately, though,

146
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:31,394
your vitals are normal, so we'll check back

147
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:32,421
with you in a little while.

148
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,187
Sounds to me like a G.I. bleed.

149
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:37,603
Sounds to me like angina.

150
00:07:37,846 --> 00:07:39,697
Look, Newbie, if you leave this hospital

151
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:41,356
knowing only one thing -- and, God save me,

152
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:43,636
it seems like there's a pretty good chance

153
00:07:43,723 --> 00:07:45,819
that just might happen -- let that one thing be this:

154
00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:48,365
that medicine is a collaborative effort.

155
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:50,211
And that means that your opinion is just

156
00:07:50,285 --> 00:07:53,291
as important as mine. So, let's see if

157
00:07:53,396 --> 00:07:55,125
you got the gobstoppers to take the lead.

158
00:07:55,782 --> 00:07:56,533
Be me!

159
00:07:58,726 --> 00:07:59,890
Come on...you can do this.

160
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:02,145
Navy scrubs! Navy scrubs! Navy scrubs!

161
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:05,874
Hhhheeeere's the deal, Eleanor:

162
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,525
We're gonna go ahead and get a full work-up on this guy.

163
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:11,891
So, while I drop an NG tube and do a gastric lavage,

164
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:13,532
why don't you go ahead and get an order

165
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:15,605
on EKG with cardio biomarkers.

166
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:17,042
If you need to know where those are,

167
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:19,886
they're on page 37 of the Ann Taylor catalog --

168
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:23,284
right next to that salmon cable-knit sweater

169
00:08:23,371 --> 00:08:24,879
you've wanted for so long but haven't had

170
00:08:24,974 --> 00:08:26,363
the courage to order...'cause you're worried

171
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,387
the weave's so thin, your nipples might just

172
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:30,779
go ahead and peek their little pink selves through.

173
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,836
Isn't that right, Dr. Cox.

174
00:08:36,595 --> 00:08:37,776
Dr. Cox...

175
00:08:38,842 --> 00:08:41,760
Oh, I-I-I'm sorry. Here I was in my own little world,

176
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,663
talking to myself and 
dreaming about candy bracelets.

177
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:45,923
I don't like candy bracelets.

178
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:47,591
I love them!

179
00:08:48,689 --> 00:08:50,000
Now you gotta grab that elevator.

180
00:08:50,294 --> 00:08:52,535
But not without giving him 
his patented shoulder bump!

181
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:53,619
Good day.

182
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:55,643
OW!

183
00:08:57,943 --> 00:08:58,536
How you like me now?

184
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:05,275
Hey, you find your pink doggie yet?

185
00:09:05,615 --> 00:09:07,032
Nope. But I had the pleasure

186
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:08,474
of meeting Helen, the laundry room lady.

187
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:10,371
Oh, I think I know her! Does she have blonde hair?

188
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,258
No.

189
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:12,335
Brown hair?

190
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,050
Y-nuh-uh.

191
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:13,773
No hair!

192
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:14,628
That's the one.

193
00:09:14,796 --> 00:09:15,489
Yeah, that's from the dryers.

194
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,336
Hey! You know, the janitor's still downstairs.

195
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:19,372
Why don't we just check his custodial closet?

196
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,503
Hey. You're not welcome here.

197
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:39,357
'Sup.

198
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,404
Randall?!

199
00:09:41,754 --> 00:09:42,754
Just got the job, brah.

200
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,706
So that's why he's been back in my dreams....

201
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,268
Beat it.

202
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:48,080
Gotta go.

203
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:54,082
Did you bring my lucky 'do-rag?

204
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:56,548
Why don't you wear the fluffy

205
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:58,751
puppies 'do-rag that I got you for Lent?

206
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,822
Baby, I hate to tell you this, but the fluffy puppies?

207
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:02,686
They killed like three people -- they banned from the O.R.

208
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,014
Well, what do you want me to do, Turk? I forgot!

209
00:10:05,176 --> 00:10:07,624
You forgot. You never pay attention to the little things

210
00:10:07,717 --> 00:10:09,046
that are important to me.

211
00:10:09,832 --> 00:10:13,747
You'd be surprised how when one thing goes wrong around here,

212
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:14,766
everything seems to go wrong.

213
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:16,798
What happened?

214
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:18,384
Vitals are tanking!

215
00:10:18,908 --> 00:10:19,984
No pulse in lower extremities.

216
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,246
I don't get it, he wasn't showing any signs of distress!

217
00:10:22,346 --> 00:10:23,738
Come on, come on, come on! We gotta make a decision here.

218
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,699
Uh...let's get him a CT angiogram -- stat.

219
00:10:26,824 --> 00:10:27,459
Good.

220
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:31,659
It's an aortic dissection. It's bad.

221
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,303
Call surgery. Tell 'em we're on our way.

222
00:10:34,972 --> 00:10:37,036
In a hospital, it's hard to avoid letting people down.

223
00:10:37,753 --> 00:10:39,557
Whether it's someone you made a promise to...

224
00:10:39,692 --> 00:10:40,596
I want my doggie!

225
00:10:40,678 --> 00:10:41,531
I'm so sorry.

226
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:44,860
Let's go, Gandhi! You're on!

227
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:46,444
...or someone you love...

228
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:47,555
I gotta go.

229
00:10:47,957 --> 00:10:48,735
Turk, I'm sorry!

230
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:52,653
...or even letting down

231
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,171
someone you barely knew at all.

232
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:13,295
In the end, it's the "what ifs"

233
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:15,870
that hurt the most. Like, what if

234
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,082
things had gone a little differently?

235
00:11:18,192 --> 00:11:20,561
Lookit, it's just that aortic dissections

236
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:22,598
are a doctor's worst nightmare.

237
00:11:22,688 --> 00:11:23,807
If you don't catch 'em early, there's

238
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,563
about a ninety percent mortality rate.

239
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:27,519
I mean, honestly, unless your patient

240
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:27,696
was lucky enough to trip and fall

241
00:11:27,723 --> 00:11:30,329
into a CAT-scan machine, he wasn't gonna

242
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:34,594
have a happy ending. Newbie, we didn't have

243
00:11:34,705 --> 00:11:36,035
a chance on this one.

244
00:11:39,582 --> 00:11:42,491
Me, I don't believe in fate. I believe

245
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:43,624
we have more control than we think,

246
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,785
and that every action has a reaction. After all....

247
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:54,979
The most minor event -- even a butterfly

248
00:11:55,097 --> 00:11:57,869
flapping its wings -- can change everything.

249
00:12:02,795 --> 00:12:06,318
Sometimes for the better. Even if

250
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,839
it doesn't seem like it at first.

251
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:11,926
Look away.

252
00:12:12,073 --> 00:12:13,458
I can't.

253
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,535
It's funny how a seemingly insignificant

254
00:12:19,636 --> 00:12:21,218
event can set everything else in motion.

255
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:23,106
Hillside landing.

256
00:12:24,351 --> 00:12:26,904
What is wrong with you? I can't believe

257
00:12:26,985 --> 00:12:28,609
you're looking at that guy's cleavage

258
00:12:28,671 --> 00:12:30,722
while Suzy Big-Rack over there is sitting

259
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,339
there busting out of her niece's tank top.

260
00:12:32,507 --> 00:12:33,747
How the hell did I miss that?

261
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:34,977
Damn, you're whipped.

262
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:35,491
Uh-uh!

263
00:12:35,575 --> 00:12:36,315
Kssshhh!

264
00:12:36,391 --> 00:12:37,617
Mmmm! Orange Goo Goo!

265
00:12:37,749 --> 00:12:38,893
Ain't nothing here for you, mooch!

266
00:12:39,032 --> 00:12:40,586
All done.

267
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:42,905
Janitor, could you help me look for

268
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:43,765
a little girl's pink stuffed doggie?

269
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:44,911
I would love to. I'll meet you upstairs in ten minutes.

270
00:12:44,987 --> 00:12:48,013
You are like...the sweetest guy!

271
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,458
I'm blushing.

272
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,744
Heh. So charming. Could you be half

273
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:54,400
as nice to me as you are to her?

274
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:58,401
You are right. We need a fresh start. Come on.

275
00:12:58,493 --> 00:13:01,353
Fresh start.

276
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,611
Mm-hmm.

277
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:07,061
I think we need a longer fresh start.

278
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:08,825
How long do ya...suppose this'll be?

279
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:10,036
Probably ten minutes.

280
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:14,628
Ease into it. Let's mix it up --

281
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:17,886
let's saw some wood. There we go. Nice. Very good.

282
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:20,414
And insignificant events can lead to significant events.

283
00:13:21,264 --> 00:13:24,202
Like me being late because I was in the world's longest handshake.

284
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:25,783
Sorry I'm late. What'd I miss?

285
00:13:26,026 --> 00:13:27,130
Take a wild guess.

286
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:39,522
I should get Turk a washboard!

287
00:13:39,671 --> 00:13:42,198
Son, do you think I got to be chief of medicine by being late?

288
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:45,331
Nooo, Bobbo! You got there by back-stabbing and ass-kissing.

289
00:13:45,495 --> 00:13:47,695
Maybe so, but I started those things promptly at 8.

290
00:13:48,347 --> 00:13:50,423
Uh, Dr. Kelso? That's my pen.

291
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:51,385
Nice grab.

292
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,195
I'm a righty.

293
00:13:52,404 --> 00:13:52,894
Ehhhhh.

294
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:55,512
...You want me to go all the way home and search through

295
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:57,935
your nasties and bring back your lucky 'do-rag?

296
00:13:58,032 --> 00:13:59,899
And if you could be back in twenty minutes, that'd be great.

297
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,160
Nurse Espinosa, your shift ended nine minutes ago.

298
00:14:03,254 --> 00:14:04,547
How is it that your time card isn't punched out?

299
00:14:04,771 --> 00:14:06,106
Well, sir--

300
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:08,904
Start punching out on time or I'll punch you out on time!

301
00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:12,651
I don't mean that violently, I was just trying to turn a phrase.

302
00:14:16,044 --> 00:14:18,466
Turk! Why didn't you stand up for me?

303
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:19,763
Baby, you said I was too whipped.

304
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:21,599
I need you to be more supportive.

305
00:14:22,521 --> 00:14:25,000
You're absolutely right, baby. And I apologize!

306
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:27,234
Remember! 'Do-rag!

307
00:14:33,752 --> 00:14:34,200
Hey, Helen.

308
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:34,930
Hey, cutie.

309
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,380
Janitor? Thanks again for your help,

310
00:14:38,495 --> 00:14:40,123
but I know that you're busy. I mean, I could just call Carla, and--

311
00:14:40,217 --> 00:14:44,892
No! Mark my words: We will find that little girl's stuffed animal.

312
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:47,374
You are really taking a personal interest in this!

313
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:52,809
Mommy! Where's my teddy bear?

314
00:14:53,513 --> 00:14:57,106
Oh. I must have accidentally thrown it out when I was cleaning up.

315
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,674
You know, this never would have happened if your room weren't so filthy.

316
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:08,446
Never again.

317
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:17,361
Ewww.

318
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:26,211
Eeeuugh!

319
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,421
Ugh.

320
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:34,205
Oh, hey. Thanks, Rowdy.

321
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,208
Hey, by the way, as soon as we're married, you're outta here.

322
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:43,959
Basically, I've had nausea and stomach pains for a couple of days now.

323
00:15:44,605 --> 00:15:46,834
Maybe you should avoid eating sushi from the Gas 'n' Go.

324
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:51,044
It came free with the fill-up! What am I supposed to do, just throw it away?

325
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,550
Yes. Yes, you are. Fortunately, though, your vitals are normal,

326
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:56,331
so we'll check back with you in a little while.

327
00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:00,049
Sounds to me like a G.I. bleed.

328
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:02,901
Look, Newbie, if you go ahead and leave this hospital

329
00:16:02,992 --> 00:16:05,857
knowing only one thing -- and God save me, it looks like

330
00:16:05,957 --> 00:16:07,918
there's a real chance that might happen -- please let

331
00:16:07,993 --> 00:16:11,566
this be that one thing: I'm in charge, and I don't care

332
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,452
about your opinion. Now go get me a cup of coffee.

333
00:16:15,798 --> 00:16:18,282
Whatever. Just avoid the shoulder bump, catch the elevator,

334
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:20,793
and make a great wise-ass remark before the doors close!

335
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:27,219
Hoohoo, hey, Dr. Cox, if you're so smart, maybe you should just...

336
00:16:27,342 --> 00:16:29,038
go ahead and be the...you're the kind of...

337
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,019
...Oh, dammit!

338
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,156
I don't know what happened there. I'm usually quick and funny....

339
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:37,691
So I had this guy today presenting vomiting and

340
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:40,504
abdominal pain? Two hours and one CT later, I tell him

341
00:16:40,587 --> 00:16:42,108
he's got ischemic bowel.

342
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:43,747
Mm.

343
00:16:43,812 --> 00:16:45,338
Have you ever noticed that words that rhyme

344
00:16:45,412 --> 00:16:50,384
with "bowel" are always bad? Like "scowl", "growl"...

345
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:53,042
"movies with Andie MacDowell"....

346
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,489
You're right, J.D. You are funny.

347
00:16:57,456 --> 00:16:58,050
Stop.

348
00:16:59,288 --> 00:17:02,596
Ischemic bowel! That's it!

349
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:09,367
Uhhmmm....

350
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,372
Heeeeyyy! Get outta here.

351
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,390
It's all right, Butchie, she's with me.

352
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:17,181
Where is that lost & found box?

353
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:18,489
Over here, brah.

354
00:17:21,084 --> 00:17:22,396
Why does it say "free stuff"?

355
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:23,910
Heh-heh. I have no idea.

356
00:17:24,812 --> 00:17:26,310
Hey-hey-hey! Is that what you're looking for?

357
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,914
Awesome! What time is it?

358
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:30,785
Uhhh.... 4:30.

359
00:17:35,594 --> 00:17:35,981
Dibs.

360
00:17:38,028 --> 00:17:38,337
Dibs.

361
00:17:41,325 --> 00:17:41,678
Butchie.

362
00:17:42,731 --> 00:17:43,011
Dude!

363
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:43,537
Back to work!

364
00:17:46,381 --> 00:17:48,047
You found it! Ha!

365
00:17:49,332 --> 00:17:49,858
'Course I did.

366
00:17:51,094 --> 00:17:53,089
See, that's what I love about you, baby.

367
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:55,413
You always pick up on the little things that are important to me.

368
00:17:55,684 --> 00:17:56,479
Yeah, that's my job.

369
00:17:56,626 --> 00:17:57,205
Ah.

370
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:02,147
You'd be surprised how when one thing

371
00:18:02,136 --> 00:18:04,635
goes right around here, everything seems to go right.

372
00:18:05,982 --> 00:18:08,007
Look, Dr. Cox, I know my opinion doesn't mean anything

373
00:18:08,097 --> 00:18:09,520
and I'm always wrong and apparently useless --

374
00:18:09,636 --> 00:18:11,188
which deep down you know isn't true because...

375
00:18:11,273 --> 00:18:13,799
shoot, I forgot your coffee. Anyway, I was thinking

376
00:18:15,111 --> 00:18:17,178
we should get a CT scan on Mr. Strauss, because

377
00:18:17,273 --> 00:18:18,967
he might have bowel ischemia.

378
00:18:19,744 --> 00:18:21,547
You know what, what the hell. It can't hurt. Let's get on it.

379
00:18:24,389 --> 00:18:25,166
All right.

380
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:29,639
It doesn't look like he's ischemic.

381
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,444
No, Newbie, but that right there is the start

382
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:34,667
of an aortic dissection, and dammit all if we didn't catch it early.

383
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:35,778
Is that good?

384
00:18:36,196 --> 00:18:37,777
That's very good. Laverne, will you call

385
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,302
the O.R. and have it prepped?

386
00:18:41,127 --> 00:18:44,014
In a hospital, it's great when you get to come through for someone.

387
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:45,779
Thanks!

388
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:47,508
See you when you wake up.

389
00:18:50,437 --> 00:18:51,607
Will you be joining us, there, Gandhi?

390
00:18:52,804 --> 00:18:53,312
Good luck.

391
00:18:55,126 --> 00:18:55,681
Already got it.

392
00:19:05,992 --> 00:19:12,175
Of course, it still doesn't always work out the way you'd hope.

393
00:19:18,187 --> 00:19:19,391
Rachel, clean up.

394
00:19:23,878 --> 00:19:26,248
In the end, you learn to treasure the times when things go your way.

395
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,158
So glad you're okay!

396
00:19:29,288 --> 00:19:31,124
And be there for the ones you love when they don't.

397
00:19:36,473 --> 00:19:38,784
And most importantly, you learn to accept that

398
00:19:38,854 --> 00:19:39,975
some things are out of your hands.

399
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,230
Didn't matter when we caught it, Newbie.

400
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:45,156
It was just his time.

401
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,508
Yeah....

402
00:19:53,782 --> 00:19:55,956
But still, with so much of life left up to chance,

403
00:19:56,037 --> 00:19:57,800
you can't help but look back and wonder...

404
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,907
What if things had been different...?
