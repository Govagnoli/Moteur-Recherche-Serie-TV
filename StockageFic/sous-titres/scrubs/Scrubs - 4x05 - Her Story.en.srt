1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,655
Even though I was already an amazing doctor,

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,450
when I became chief resident I decided to add
a little something extra to my repertoire.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,000
A "hook," if you will.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,650
Mrs. MacCalla, 40s, moderately attractive,
condition improving.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,580
Did you just say I was moderately attractive?

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,110
Excuse me, Mrs. MacCalla.

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,640
Patient's complaint of hearing loss
was clearly just to get attention.

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,350
Where'd you get the idea
for the stupid tape recorder?

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,810
Dude, I love your new tape recorder.

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,480
You two are idiots!

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,280
Come on, Carla,
I wanted a hook and I only had one other idea.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,370
Mr. Hawkins, the results of your tests
are back, and you have...

13
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:39,740
Liver disease! Liver disease!

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,880
Sorry, that's all he can say.
Anyway, you don't have liver disease...

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,670
you have inoperable lung cancer.

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:45,930
Liver disease!

17
00:00:45,965 --> 00:00:46,990
If only, Chauncy.

18
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,670
Bottom line, that tape recorder
won't fly away and break your heart.

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,785
I'm sorry!

20
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,240
I'm just a little edgy because
my husband woke me up again last night,

21
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:58,240
and he knows once I'm up
I can't go back to sleep!

22
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,790
Baby, I was quiet last night.

23
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,200
Great. I'm awake.

24
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,150
Sorry about that, sweetness.

25
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,060
Um, since you're up,
I was wondering if maybe we could...

26
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:14,370
Are you crazy?

27
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,880
No, Turk. But...

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,890
Gesundheit!

29
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,830
I love my new tape recorder.

30
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,050
Not only is it a time-saver,
I can record my every thought.

31
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,540
I like toast.

32
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,260
They aren't all winners.

33
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,220
Still, as long as I have this thing,
I don't need to be in my head so much.

34
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,990
Excuse me! Heh!

35
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,650
Why did I say "excuse me"?
He bumped in to me!

36
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,240
I have to stop doing that.

37
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,770
Excuse me!

38
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,550
Frick!

39
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,090
Hey, I got you a blueberry muffin, but I know you
don't like blueberries, so I picked them all out.

40
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,560
A lot of people think Molly's a little off,
but I totally get her.

41
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,990
She's like the big sister I always wanted.

42
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,005
She makes me feel better about myself.

43
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,370
They're so not finger-toes.
I mean, these are finger-toes.

44
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:00,150
Yours are cute like french fries.

45
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,080
Really?

46
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,080
Yeah!

47
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,770
I can do calligraphy with mine.

48
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,220
She looks after me.

49
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,170
Sorry! Sorry!

50
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,460
She makes me do things I don't normally do.

51
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,990
She's the Peppermint Patty to my Marcy...

52
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,630
you know, minus the thick glasses
and the strong lesbian vibe.

53
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,880
Half of what rappers say doesn't make any sense.
Like that Snoop Dogg-Dr. Dre song?

54
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,240
What does "still hittin' them corners
and those ho-hos girl" mean?

55
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,180
Many disadvantaged African-Americans
have limited nutritional choices,

56
00:02:49,215 --> 00:02:52,150
therefore they must subsist on Ho-Ho snack cakes.

57
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,840
It's a black thing, bro.

58
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,450
Actually, Turk, it's "still hittin' them corners
and them'lo-los' girls. "

59
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,890
Lo-los, not ho-hos.

60
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,340
See, Turk, in the'hood,

61
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,270
a lo-lo is a lowrider, or a car with an adjusted
suspension that allows it to bounce up and down.

62
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,690
And Dre and Snoop enjoy driving around together
in their lowriders around the corners,

63
00:03:09,725 --> 00:03:10,965
or lizzle-rizzles.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,630
I'm representin' for them gangtas all across the world!

65
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,055
Still hittin' them corners and them lo-los girls!

66
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,730
Still taking my time to perfect the beat, and I still got love for the street!

67
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,140
Turk! You just got schooled on rap by the two whitest chicks in America!

68
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:26,210
None of you can prove it!

69
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,380
I got it on tape.

70
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,270
Scrubs épisode 4x05:
Her story

71
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,270
Transcript: http:/scrubs. mopnt. com/scripts/
Script & Timing: Siefaz Pour www. forom. com

72
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,860
There's Dr. Kelso.

73
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,105
Okay, you're chief resident now, so say hi.

74
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,640
But don't stop, or you'll have to come up with something else to say,

75
00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:54,560
and you know you don't improvise well.

76
00:03:54,595 --> 00:03:55,570
Hi, Dr. Kelso!

77
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,790
Dr. Reid.

78
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,570
I see you've trimmed your nose hair!

79
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,720
Frick on a stick!

80
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,960
Molly's nervous because her boyfriend's in town.

81
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,920
You know, Mike's kind of private, so when we go out to dinner, just pretend I never told you any of that personal stuff.

82
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,210
Gotcha.

83
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,870
Mike's got a curved peep.

84
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,385
Whoa!

85
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,490
Whoa, whoa, whoa... whoa, watch your step, there, little lady!

86
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,905
Thanks, Janitor!

87
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,980
He is so sweet! But why doesn't he just put up a sign that says "wet floor"?

88
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,900
Wet floor.

89
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,880
Sorry I'm late! I was recording some thoughts and I slipped and fell.

90
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:35,630
Gimme this!

91
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,710
Possible nicknames for Dr. Cox when we become best friends:

92
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,120
The Coxinator. Cox of Seagulls.

93
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,580
Here it comes. Another condescending rant about how we suck at our jobs.

94
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,510
Since you two have become chief residents, I've noticed that your leadership skills are...

95
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:52,120
how can I put this delicately?

96
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,120
Crap!

97
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,140
Oh, sir, I don't know about that. Some people say I'm

98
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,175
That is so not nice!

99
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,420
Well, then, why don't you go ahead and get that young resident back there to come up here?

100
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,770
Easy. Lonnie?

101
00:05:02,805 --> 00:05:03,780
Not right now!

102
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,050
Yessir?

103
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,690
Slap yourself very hard in the face, then leave.

104
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,140
Anyway, one of you two is going to speak at grand rounds today.

105
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,000
And here comes the part where he throws me to the wolves to protect his little protégé.

106
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,910
...meenie, miney... aha... moe. Barbie, you're up.

107
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,610
Perfect.

108
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,210
Our TV's working. Why are you reading?

109
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,410
Oh, I'm researching some leadership techniques for my residents.

110
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,960
Well, you're better off watching good ol' Papa Smurf, here!

111
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,420
Yeah, he says leadership boils down to three things:

112
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,760
Smurferation, Smurferation, Smurf.

113
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,340
"Preparation, Inspiration, and Fear"?

114
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,540
You know it.

115
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,940
Ooh, are we playing pillow feet again?

116
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,890
I'm not waking Carla tonight.

117
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,310
Turk.

118
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,880
I'm sorry, baby.

119
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,150
So you're definitely up now, huh?

120
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:10,080
Yes!

121
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,950
That's it. From now on, you and I are going to bed at the same time.

122
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,370
Okay, that's fine.

123
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,950
But you know what, baby, since you're up, I was wondering...

124
00:06:20,985 --> 00:06:24,300
No, Turk! I can't believe that you...

125
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,870
Oh, my God.

126
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,230
How does she eat like that and stay so thin?

127
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,250
If I didn't love her so much, I'd totally spread rumors that she's bulimic.

128
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,490
So how's it going?

129
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,150
I'm freaking out about grand rounds today because Dr. Cox hung me out to dry again.

130
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,890
You'll be fine. Just do what I do: Fake it till you make it.

131
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,380
Like when a guy is really bad in bed and you pretend that he is awesome

132
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:53,770
so he doesn't go to a special store, buy one of those weird pumps,

133
00:06:53,805 --> 00:06:55,530
and then accidentally run into your dad?

134
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,850
Kind of...

135
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,720
See Dr. Kelso over there?

136
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,350
I have to go over and justify my program for our psychotic homeless population?

137
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,490
Am I scared to go over to his table of stuffy fat guys,

138
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,470
'cause I know they're just gonna stare and my chest the whole time?

139
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,670
Of course!

140
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,560
But...

141
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,810
I'm just gonna act confident, and they're gonna believe that I'm confident.

142
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,390
Wow!

143
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,570
'Scuse me.

144
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,470
Yeah, those are my boobs.

145
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,820
Have you had time to go over my proposal?

146
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,880
Ah, yes, medical care for crazy homeless people. Sounds like a money-maker.

147
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,290
You know it's a good idea!

148
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,490
As I watched Molly shielding her boobs and working her magic,

149
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,700
I realized she wasn't just my friend...

150
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,530
she's the mentor I've always been looking for.

151
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,660
Check out my man getting his leadership on!

152
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,060
First he hits'em with a little preparation.

153
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,580
Are there any more questions about evolving treatment therapies?

154
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,720
Next, inspiration.

155
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,550
Now, I just want you to know, you guys all have the potential to be amazing doctors.

156
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,380
And finally, a dose of fear.

157
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,040
M'kay, I'll see you guys.

158
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,600
Okay, fear might need a little work, but otherwise Smurftastic!

159
00:08:04,635 --> 00:08:05,830
That's how I Smurf, baby.

160
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,900
Mm, Smurfette. Blue boobies.

161
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,120
Who wants some of this!

162
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,850
Turk! It's bedtime.

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,095
Baby, when you said we'd go to sleep at the same time,

164
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,190
I thought you meant you'd stay up until I went to sleep.

165
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,210
Turk. That's crazy talk!

166
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,430
The guys are here and it's the ninth inning!

167
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,090
Gentlemen, a moment for our fallen comrade.

168
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,440
How, uh, how old is this patient?

169
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,280
Seventy-nine.

170
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,100
Uh-huh. And...

171
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,440
how old would you say he was when you started this procedure?

172
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,530
The more I thought about how awesome Molly is, the more I got sick of Dr. Cox's crap.

173
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,740
Oh my God, I could fly to China, adopt a child,

174
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,205
raise her and send her to medical school,

175
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,860
and then train her to do this procedure in the time it's taking you to finish.

176
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,510
Enough! He's never been there for you!

177
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,210
Burn this bridge once and for all!

178
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,850
Barbie, honest to God, if you...

179
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:15,940
You know what, Dr. Cox?

180
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,990
I have so had it with this whole macho alpha-male thing, and I have heard every tired,

181
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,315
recycled put-down you have in you. So, from now on,

182
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,230
save your stupid lessons for someone who gives a frick, because honestly,

183
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,740
I don't even wanna see you or the stupid poodle perm of yours

184
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:30,150
unless it's walking away from me.

185
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,570
God, that felt great!

186
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,300
Huh. Hopefully it won't have ramifications for anyone else.

187
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,350
I'm feeling so good today!

188
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,240
I still feel good,'cause nobody saw me fall!

189
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,890
That sound you're hearing is my residents' respect.

190
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,120
It feels good.

191
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:53,680
GLORIA!

192
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,300
You're supposed to start pre-rounds at 7 o'clock. It's now 7:03.

193
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,735
I'm sorry I'm late, but I was singing and I fell.

194
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:03,030
And I know I've used the falling excuse before, but it happened again!

195
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,890
Look!

196
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,145
I know the only thing you've ever been responsible for...

197
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,440
was picking which Duran Duran cover band would play at your sorority formal,

198
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,350
but you're supposed to be teaching these kids.

199
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,270
So how's about you learn how to walk, ditch the tape recorder, and act like you got a pair!

200
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,010
Ha-ha!

201
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,210
Kill Lonnie.

202
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,170
I felt great after telling Dr. Cox off. Why?

203
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,550
Because I knew I had someone to support me, someone to look up to,

204
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,070
someone pretty amazing.

205
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,590
That outfit would look better on my floor.

206
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,080
Mistake!

207
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,260
Ohh! No! Not the Lasso of Truth!

208
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,610
I once had a threesome... and not the cool kind!

209
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,670
Hey! Uh, we gotta do the dinner another night.

210
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,490
How come?

211
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,235
Well, Mike got up early this morning and he wanted to read the paper,

212
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,160
and I don't get it, so then he went to the neighbors', and they don't get it either, so...

213
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,670
he broke into their garage and stole their car and wrapped it around a telephone pole.

214
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,470
Oh my God, is he okay?

215
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,660
I've been better.

216
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,950
Oh, sorry. Mike, Elliot. Elliot, Mike.

217
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,800
Ohh, that's great!

218
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,510
I'll be right in.

219
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,310
Elliot, I'm sorry...

220
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,470
You don't have to say anything... I know all about how it is...

221
00:11:22,505 --> 00:11:24,610
when you think a guy is great and he ends up being a car thief.

222
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,640
Well, you know, relationships are never perfect, and...

223
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,450
and Mike's got a lot of potential.

224
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,640
He's got the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen.

225
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh my God, my mentor's a crazy person!

226
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:33,905
Molly!

227
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,605
Coming, babe!

228
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,310
So, uh, rain-check on the dinner!

229
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,070
Yeah!

230
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:42,990
Watching Molly, I found myself asking the same questions I always do.

231
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,690
Did I line up behind the wrong person?

232
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,150
Am I too much of a wimp?

233
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,740
Oh my God! What a catch!

234
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,210
Will people around here ever respect me?

235
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,080
Guys? Guys. Guys!

236
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:07,580
Unfortunately I had closed the door on the creep who used to occasionally give me answers.

237
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,700
I just had to hope that I hadn't closed it for good.

238
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,320
Uh, Dr. Cox, do you have a sec?

239
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,660
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

240
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,980
As I watched Molly gently stroke the hand of a convicted felon,

241
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,340
I had to admit his eyes were stunning.

242
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,160
Still, I couldn't help but think what the next few years would be like if she was my mentor.

243
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,385
The police caught this guy robbing a liquor store.

244
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,290
His tox-screen came back positive for methamphetamines and cocaine.

245
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,515
Okay, what should I do?

246
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,710
Oh my God, make out with him immediately! He's such a catch!

247
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,410
Hi, I'm Dr. Reid.

248
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,560
What's up?

249
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,470
Dude, Dr. Cox went ballistic on me in front of all my residents,

250
00:13:03,505 --> 00:13:05,280
now I've lost my mojo. Check this out.

251
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,605
Hey, J.D.

252
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,750
See, there's no fear! Can you help a brother out?

253
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,200
Dude, I've got my own problems! I've got a bedtime again!

254
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,240
I haven't had a bedtime in like twelve years!

255
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,800
You had a bedtime when you were seventeen?

256
00:13:16,835 --> 00:13:17,900
No! Not every night.

257
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,610
On the weekends I didn't have to be in bed by 11, but I had to be in my room.

258
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:21,760
Oh. That's way cooler.

259
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,670
The point is Carla's setting some kind of record on being a major pain in the ass, and I can't help you.

260
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:30,110
Carla's setting some kind of record on being a major pain the ass, and I can't help you.

261
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
Okay, here's what you do...

262
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,165
Okay, you can't bend that way anymore,

263
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,630
'cause when you do, that last vertebrae above your butt sticks out

264
00:13:41,665 --> 00:13:43,350
and makes you look like a prehistoric camel.

265
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,910
What are you thinking?

266
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,920
Same ol', same ol'.

267
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,270
Camel-butt?

268
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,360
Yeah...

269
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,860
Hey, Carla, can you warn everyone that Mike gets a little handsy when he's on the pain-killers?

270
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,430
Dr. Vaji already told us.

271
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,110
It was horrible.

272
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,920
Um, Elliot, do you wanna grab some lunch?

273
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,740
Oh, um, I'm sorry, I can't. I'm, uh, busy.

274
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:04,990
Okay.

275
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,090
I felt bad, but it was time to start pulling away.

276
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,900
Dr. Cox?

277
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:12,620
Hold on.

278
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,210
Say, Bob, did you happen to order any of the pain in the ass?

279
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:16,695
No.

280
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,640
We didn't order any of the pain in the ass.

281
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,330
You yelled at me in front of my residents!

282
00:14:20,365 --> 00:14:21,375
I didn't yell at ya.

283
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,340
So how's about you learn to walk, ditch the tape recorder, and act like you got a pair!

284
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,650
I'll let you two talk.

285
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,540
Oh, and Perry, I would be remiss if I didn't tell you that earlier I wish I'd said,

286
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:34,120
"I must have ordered the pain in the ass, seeing as you're sitting there. "

287
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,240
Here I was thinking the same thing, Bob. Let's do this again.

288
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,370
Tell you what, there, Gidget,

289
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:44,410
if you promise to leave right now, I won't yell at you in front of your peons anymore.

290
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,090
You ruined my credibility! Now look me in the eyes and tell me that's not messed up!

291
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:49,580
Fair enough.

292
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,495
Later on today when you are with your residents, I'll come up for something,

293
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:56,930
you'll tell me you're too busy in a manly way, and I will contritely turn around

294
00:14:56,965 --> 00:14:59,760
and walk out of the room with my tail between my legs. Problem solved.

295
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,425
Can you pull off contrite?

296
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,500
Can you pull off manly way?

297
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,530
Should have seen that coming.

298
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,850
Oh, hey, Turk, would you pour me a cup of decaf, please? We gotta go to bed early tonight.

299
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,580
I'll have some of that decaf, son!

300
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,220
Sir, see, this is regular.

301
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,800
Yeah, I gotta give Carla the strong stuff just to keep her awake so I can stay up a little later.

302
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,270
Ahh, drugging your own wife. Been there.

303
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,690
Careful, though.

304
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,110
Starts out with coffee, next thing you know, you're rooting around the nightstand...

305
00:15:26,145 --> 00:15:28,650
for an adrenaline shot to counteract a Valium overdose.

306
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,380
Your coffee, my love.

307
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,650
Thank you, my husband.

308
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,390
What a fun day.

309
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,920
Hey, camel-butt!

310
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,570
I heard you and Carla talking earlier.

311
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,500
Frick on a stick with a brick! Just leave.

312
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,020
Oh, whoa, now.

313
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,540
What happened to... what happened to feisty Barbie, huh?

314
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:02,240
You know, it took me a helluva lot to shake off that tongue-lashing you gave me yesterday.

315
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,310
Yeah, well, yesterday I had a mentor, but she turned out to be insane.

316
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,745
I mean, how am I supposed to take professional advice...

317
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,830
from somebody who can't even hold together their personal life?

318
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,050
Look, I know you and I have never really connected...

319
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,835
maybe that's because you're relentlessly annoying,

320
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,640
or maybe it's my fault because I can't tolerate relentlessly annoying people...

321
00:16:19,675 --> 00:16:21,890
I don't know. But answer me one question:

322
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,410
Do you think I'm a good teacher?

323
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,030
To some people.

324
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,090
Fair enough. Why don't we go ahead and take a look at my personal life?

325
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,810
I am in love with a woman that I hate, my two-year-old son calls me "Pewwy," and...

326
00:16:34,845 --> 00:16:38,240
this is something that I've never actually shared with anybody before, but...

327
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,735
on Saturday nights, I like to throw on a nice dress,

328
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:45,530
go out to dive bars, and insist that everybody call me Mrs. Haberdasher!

329
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,370
No, you don't.

330
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,390
Well, even if I did, it wouldn't really matter since that has nothing to do...

331
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:55,055
with how good of a teacher I am. Stick with me here, Barbie.

332
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,600
The point is that if you finally found somebody who makes you believe in yourself...

333
00:16:58,635 --> 00:17:00,140
as much as you did yesterday, well,

334
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,290
I would think twice before I wrote that person off.

335
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,730
Okay, everybody, gather around please?

336
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,340
Newbie, I need to talk to you?

337
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,160
I'm a little busy right now, Perry!

338
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,980
Oh. My fault, I'll come back later.

339
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,050
Oh, and another thing.

340
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,340
From now on, I'd prefer it if you'd address me as "Dr. Dorian. "

341
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,490
Are you really doing this?

342
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,840
You bet your ass I am.

343
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,870
And from now on, if you have a problem with me, you come see me in private,

344
00:17:33,905 --> 00:17:35,190
not in front of my boys!

345
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,190
My boys got enough to worry about!

346
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,550
Wrap it up, there, bingo.

347
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,870
I simply will not tolerate it, Perry! And neither will my boys!

348
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,640
The next minute you find yourself alone, I'm gonna kill ya.

349
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,010
It was worth it.

350
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,250
Lonnie, slap the face!

351
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,980
All of you, slap your faces!

352
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,510
Awesome.

353
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:11,760
Mm? Wha? Wha? Oooh. It's morning already?

354
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,170
No. But I could see how you'd think that, being that it's light out and we're in bed.

355
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:21,120
Baby, since we got married, I've done every little thing you've asked me to do.

356
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,300
But I will not have my woman tell me when I need to go to bed! Okay!

357
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,710
Okay.

358
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,810
Really, that quick?

359
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,980
I love it when you're all "my woman this, my woman that. "

360
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,940
That's what's up.

361
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,330
Goodnight.

362
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,510
We're keepin' the lights on?

363
00:18:44,545 --> 00:18:45,135
Oh, yeah.

364
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,110
Oh, yeah! Ohh!

365
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,170
Hey, Molly?

366
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,330
I was just wondering if I could get your advice on something.

367
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,920
You know, if you're not too busy with Mike.

368
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,320
Oh, actually we decided to take a little break.

369
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:01,730
How long?

370
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,180
Two-to-five years.

371
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,620
I freaked you out a little bit with him, didn't I?

372
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,780
I try not to judge.

373
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,160
I know I should know better, I'm a shrink.

374
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,720
But show me a guy who wants to get married and has a good job, and it's like snoozeville for me.

375
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,615
But if you know a thirty-five-year-old who still lives at home with his mom...

376
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,590
and he still thinks his band can make it, tell me where to meet him so I can buy him dinner!

377
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:29,520
Listening to Molly made me realize a person doesn't have to be perfect to be exactly what you need.

378
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,030
Yeah, I've dated some pretty immature guys, too.

379
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,085
Hello, tiny ladies!

380
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,210
I don't believe we've met! I'm the world's most giant doctor! Nice to...

381
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,570
As I watched Elliot and Molly walk off, and thought about how Lonnie...

382
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:50,280
was a much less stable giant doctor base than Turk,

383
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:54,100
I realized how important it is to have someone close to you that you can count on.

384
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,060
Lonnie! Damn you!

385
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:05,080
Especially if that someone is a resident that can keep Dr. Cox from killing you.

386
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,210
Not in front of my boys! This is Lonnie! He's one of my boys!

387
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,240
Not sure what that means. See you later.

388
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,110
Sometimes you have to keep people closer than you'd like.

389
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,670
That was too easy.

390
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,670
No way I'm doing that seven nights a week.

391
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,260
In my case, it was best just to keep my distance.

392
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,080
Can I have a word with you?

393
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:37,750
Go.

394
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,090
I wonder if we're going to a happy place?
