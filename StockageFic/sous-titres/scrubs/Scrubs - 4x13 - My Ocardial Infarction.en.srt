1
00:00:01,674 --> 00:00:03,903
It's been a long road,
but over the past two months,

2
00:00:03,938 --> 00:00:05,878
Elliot and I have totally
rebuilt our friendship.

3
00:00:05,913 --> 00:00:07,442
Incoming !

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,188
Good morning !

5
00:00:13,903 --> 00:00:16,727
Co-chiefy, got you a
little som'n-som'n !

6
00:00:16,762 --> 00:00:21,400
Thank you ! And I actually got
you a little something...

7
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:26,932
A magnifying glass ?

8
00:00:26,967 --> 00:00:30,170
Yes.... For these.

9
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:36,174
You got the tiny post-its ! Awesome !
For our tiny bulletin board!

10
00:00:37,226 --> 00:00:42,446
I have a dentist appointment that
got moved to Tuesday at 4 PM.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,760
Don't floss before you come in,
it makes your gums bloody.

12
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,080
Bottom line -- together, Elliot and I are

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,370
the greatest co-chief
residents of all time.

14
00:00:52,408 --> 00:00:57,173
You two are, without a doubt,
the worst co-chief residents of all time.

15
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,984
And in case you haven't noticed,

16
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:02,578
we've got ourselves one hospital
chock-full of monkey interns,

17
00:01:02,613 --> 00:01:07,080
and, news-flash, your job is
to catch whatever they're flinging.

18
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:12,176
Coffee talk, ladies, is now officially over.
Get your asses to work.

19
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:13,886
Now !

20
00:01:14,889 --> 00:01:16,319
Cream ?

21
00:01:16,482 --> 00:01:17,888
Please !

22
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:20,606
Yep, not even Dr. Cox could faze us,

23
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:23,074
Because we had every facet of this job down.

24
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:25,857
We figured out a fair way
to schedule all the interns' shifts....

25
00:01:25,892 --> 00:01:31,009
Whoever gets Dr. Reid's scrub top back to
her first doesn't have to work this weekend !

26
00:01:31,044 --> 00:01:33,030
Commence the scuffle !

27
00:01:34,155 --> 00:01:35,221
I hope it doesn't rain today.

28
00:01:35,256 --> 00:01:36,076
Me too.

29
00:01:38,214 --> 00:01:40,503
We knew how to protect
the interns from Dr. Kelso.

30
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:42,915
Look, Brent, is it ?

31
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,409
Son, please tell me you come
with a money back guarantee,

32
00:01:46,444 --> 00:01:48,660
because I'd like to get something useful

33
00:01:48,695 --> 00:01:52,520
like a can of Brent remover !
I mean, for God's sa--

34
00:01:52,555 --> 00:01:55,571
sake, Brent ! When are you
gonna wake up and use that...

35
00:01:55,606 --> 00:01:58,072
rock that you have been
calling your skull ?!

36
00:01:58,107 --> 00:01:58,813
We got this.

37
00:01:58,848 --> 00:02:02,463
I mean, even a blind squirrel
occasionally finds a nut ! And--

38
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:03,865
He's gone. He's gone.

39
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,096
Heh, look, Brent, you are doing fine.

40
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:08,926
Still, it's not like we didn't keep
the interns on their toes.

41
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:13,392
So, Lonnie, get in here and see
the effects of cirrhosis of the liver.

42
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:17,897
J.D. ! You knew I was gonna do that !

43
00:02:17,932 --> 00:02:21,123
But it was still very startling !

44
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:23,796
Here's your shirt, Dr. Reid.

45
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:27,386
Wow, Daisy !
Enjoy your weekend, you little scrapper!

46
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:28,581
h, Daisy, I'm supposed to ask you --

47
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:30,957
can Lonnie have his lower lip back ?

48
00:02:30,992 --> 00:02:32,569
It's my trophy.

49
00:02:35,562 --> 00:02:37,285
Hey, this guy's coding.

50
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,814
Don't get me wrong,
I can handle a code. But every so often,

51
00:02:39,815 --> 00:02:43,609
every single thing that can conceivably
go wrong with a patient goes wrong at once.

52
00:02:43,644 --> 00:02:44,287
He's in v-ac.

53
00:02:44,322 --> 00:02:45,250
We've lost an airway.

54
00:02:45,285 --> 00:02:46,208
He's blown a pupil.

55
00:02:46,243 --> 00:02:47,971
Okay, just gimme a second, all right ?

56
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:51,105
I call these "train wreck codes,"
and they're not my forte.

57
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:53,073
Luckily, that's when Elliot is at her best.

58
00:02:53,108 --> 00:02:54,259
J.D., I've got your back.

59
00:02:54,656 --> 00:02:56,985
Laverne, ???, get me the crash cart, grab me

60
00:02:56,986 --> 00:02:59,046
a central line kit, I'll bag him.
Run the fluids wide open.

61
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:00,882
I honestly didn't understand

62
00:03:00,883 --> 00:03:03,087
how she could do so many things at once.

63
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:11,576
Four letters, Band that sang 'Roseanna' ?

64
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:15,718
Toto !

65
00:03:16,508 --> 00:03:18,296
T.O.T.O. Toto !

66
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:21,444
Okay, he's stable.

67
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:24,077
See, my problem is that I've just
never been much of a multi-tasker.

68
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,833
For instance, I can't eat and watch T.V.

69
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:29,131
Or drive my scooter and answer my phone.

70
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:32,742
Wide open !

71
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,906
Look out, look out,
look out, look out, look out !

72
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:38,580
What the -- ?

73
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:40,379
Scared Lonnie again !

74
00:03:43,124 --> 00:03:43,944
Tater tot !

75
00:03:44,328 --> 00:03:46,177
Over here! I'll get you back outside !

76
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:58,860
Whoever this is, you are not gonna
believe what just happened to me !

77
00:03:58,895 --> 00:04:01,790
No, I believe it. It was cool.

78
00:04:02,305 --> 00:04:04,024
Janitor.

79
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:07,681
Ambrosia !

Thank you, Janitor !

86
00:04:30,377 --> 00:04:31,836
Classic Janitor !

87
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,333
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

88
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:36,097
You know that guy that crashed
this morning is doing great ?

89
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:37,536
Barbie,

90
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:40,644
Maybe you could take a break
from congratulating yourself and

91
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:43,145
figure out what's wrong with
Mrs. Kasuba over there,

92
00:04:43,146 --> 00:04:46,739
seeing as you're her doctor and
she's been in the I.C.U. for three days.

93
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:49,725
We're, um, running lots of tests.

94
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,443
Tests ? Oh, goody !

95
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:54,134
And what exactly will you be looking for ?

96
00:04:54,135 --> 00:04:56,501
And if it's the slowest
doctor in the hospital, then

97
00:04:56,536 --> 00:04:58,701
ding, ding, ding, ding,

98
00:04:58,736 --> 00:05:01,288
I already found her.
Figure it out.

99
00:05:01,323 --> 00:05:03,115
See, this is why it doesn't
bother me that Elliot is

100
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:05,214
so much better with the train wreck codes.

101
00:05:05,249 --> 00:05:08,930
Her biggest weakness is
my biggest strength -- diagnosis.

102
00:05:08,965 --> 00:05:12,344
Elliot, if you need help,
just ask Dr. Diagnosis.

103
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:16,163
You could be my side-kick !
Bangs McCoy!

104
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,081
Lately it seemed like Turk was being
a little casual about his diabetes.

105
00:05:21,116 --> 00:05:22,337
Okay, you all know the rules.

106
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:24,549
I test my blood sugar, you bet high or low,

107
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:29,339
and twenty-five percent goes to diabetes.
Because if we all work hard, together...

108
00:05:29,574 --> 00:05:31,430
I can get a big-ass flat screen.

109
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:32,594
That's right, baby !

110
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,348
I want high.

111
00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:36,928
Low and slow, that's his tempo !

112
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:38,317
This game is sick

113
00:05:38,482 --> 00:05:39,359
High.

114
00:05:39,394 --> 00:05:41,767
194.

115
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:42,485
Ouais!

116
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,265
That high, baby ?

117
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,181
You've been sneaking
brownies, haven't you ?

118
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:50,322
Well, don't think that when you go blind
I'm gonna go get you no seeing-eye dog !

119
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:52,091
I'm gonna name him Gizmo.

120
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:53,663
That's what we were gonna name our robot !

121
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:56,036
Oh, well, when we get the robot,
we'll just name him TuPac.

122
00:05:56,278 --> 00:05:59,761
TuPac, may I please have some waffles ?
- Would you like some sy-rup ?

123
00:05:59,796 --> 00:06:02,323
Yeah, that'd be fine.
It'll work. It's a good idea.

124
00:06:07,392 --> 00:06:09,916
Maybe Mrs. Kasuba has
a perinephric abscess ?

125
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:12,097
No, her pain is central,
not near the back.

126
00:06:12,132 --> 00:06:13,622
Come on, Bangs !

127
00:06:13,657 --> 00:06:15,721
You know what helps me
when I'm diagnosing ?

128
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:20,124
Mentally picturing everything.
Like those sugar packets there.

129
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,436
How do you think they got there ?

130
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:27,739
Somebody probably knocked them over.

131
00:06:29,352 --> 00:06:32,399
I don't think so. You see,
the packets are neatly stacked.

132
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,537
Plus that coffee cup has the lipstick

133
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:38,842
of a certain very hot Nurse Tisdale.

134
00:06:39,804 --> 00:06:43,097
If you're looking for sugar,
there's some on the floor.

135
00:06:46,863 --> 00:06:49,144
Thonnnnnnng !

136
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:52,699
It's the classic Todd Thong Sugar Trap.

137
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:53,960
Wow.

138
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:56,339
Now, let's apply
the same thing to Mrs. Kasuba.

139
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,153
We know this isn't the first time

140
00:06:58,154 --> 00:06:59,604
she's experienced abdominal pain.

141
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,252
What else do we know about her ?

142
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:05,016
Oh, you know what, J.D. ?
Um, I've gotta run. Are you okay here ?

143
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:06,156
Yeah, I got this.

144
00:07:08,521 --> 00:07:12,914
Say, that was some real
Nancy Drew stuff, there...

145
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:16,099
Nancy. I mean, absolutely
irrelevant as far as medicine goes

146
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:17,585
but damn amusing!

147
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,065
Don't feel weird because
you're threatened by my gift.

148
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,369
Many are.

149
00:07:21,404 --> 00:07:24,045
Did you feel that you weren't
quite annoying enough

150
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:27,039
without adding
a delusional sense of grandeur ?

151
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,409
Because I promise you,
you are annoying enough.

152
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,476
In fact, you're the number one contender
for the middle weight annoyance crown.

153
00:07:34,511 --> 00:07:40,118
You're the number one jealous... weight for
the jealous weight... jealous ch-champ.

154
00:07:40,153 --> 00:07:47,657
He's done it ! He's done it ! Dorian's the
MOST ANNOYING Man in the WORLD !

155
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:52,047
Who would've ever though
a journeyman annoyer like Dorian might....

156
00:07:52,082 --> 00:07:54,313
You are a close second !

157
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,196
I have a couple of announcements.

158
00:07:56,197 --> 00:07:59,892
There's a serious problem around here
with not getting to know our patients.

159
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:04,050
Yes, the doctor told you to administer
Halidol, but why is he prescribing it ?

160
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:05,921
Does the patient have
a chance of sundowning

161
00:08:05,922 --> 00:08:07,565
or is he prone to psychotic breaks

162
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:08,821
and needs to be tied down ?

163
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,746
You have to ask these
questions, right Tammy ?

164
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:14,965
Child, we are swamped. Where you think
we're gonna get that kind of time ?

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,852
Laverne, if you care,
you'll go the extra mile.

166
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:19,618
Like my husband. Turk ?

167
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:23,023
You have three patients on the floor.
What can you tell us about them ?

168
00:08:23,058 --> 00:08:25,943
Well, I'm cutting out that guy's appendix,

169
00:08:25,944 --> 00:08:29,614
I'm sewing up her lacerated spleen,
and I'm slicing off that dude's foot.

170
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:32,075
Great. And why are you doing those things ?

171
00:08:32,182 --> 00:08:34,216
Because it says so on the charts.

172
00:08:35,702 --> 00:08:36,835
What'd I do ?

173
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:41,316
J.D. ! You up for some coffee ?

174
00:08:41,351 --> 00:08:44,233
I can't. I've almost got
Mrs. Kasuba's condition figured out.

175
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:46,426
Hey, I'll, uh, join you for a cup of mud.

176
00:08:46,461 --> 00:08:48,943
Great ! Meet me downstairs in five minutes.

177
00:08:48,978 --> 00:08:51,758
I'll be there. Just let me wash
this, uh, glue off my hands.

178
00:08:53,935 --> 00:08:55,645
What was he gluing ?

179
00:08:57,555 --> 00:08:59,467
Not again.

180
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,557
I can't believe you're going
on a date with the Janitor !

181
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:07,428
J.D., it's just coffee.
It's not a date.

182
00:09:11,197 --> 00:09:12,299
Milady.

183
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:14,799
I have to go.

184
00:09:18,454 --> 00:09:21,042
Baby, don't be mad,
you know about surgeons.

185
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:23,271
We're hammers,
and our patients are nails.

186
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:26,527
And hammers don't get to know nails,
they hammer them. Why ?

187
00:09:26,562 --> 00:09:28,260
Because...hammers.

188
00:09:28,295 --> 00:09:30,911
For the last time, Turk,
I'm not gonna call you The Hammer.

189
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:34,262
Look, I was trying to make a point to
my nurses, and I needed you to back me up.

190
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:36,835
Yeah, but none of the other hammers
get to know their patients.

191
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,979
Yeah, well, none of them get to do

192
00:09:39,014 --> 00:09:40,838
what you did to me last night either.

193
00:09:42,404 --> 00:09:45,923
Come on, Buppie, give it to me.

194
00:09:47,098 --> 00:09:48,720
See? When I clap my hands
at the same time,

195
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,005
it looks totally real.

196
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,870
I know. Let's go freak out J.D. !

197
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,546
Okay, fine, I'll try.
One condition: Gimme some !

198
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,081
Oh my God !

199
00:10:03,116 --> 00:10:06,801
I think it, and she does it !

200
00:10:06,904 --> 00:10:10,453
Acute intermittent porphyria !
I figured it out !

201
00:10:10,454 --> 00:10:12,944
All right, who's got
Dr. Cox's pager number ?

202
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,115
Oh, who'm I kidding,
I've got my Perry's Pager Song.

203
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,921
Dr. Cox at my door, pager 324.

204
00:10:18,956 --> 00:10:21,208
There it is. Laverne, I'm gonna
need you to get Mrs. Kasuba

205
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:22,681
started on IV dextrose and hemotin.

206
00:10:22,716 --> 00:10:24,866
Dr. Reid already ordered that.

207
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,571
She what ?

208
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:32,379
Um, you know what, J.D., I've gotta run.
Are you okay here?

209
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:35,418
She figured it out before me.

210
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:38,739
There are a lot of things
that can knock a guy on his ass.

211
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,113
ll right now, before we start,
just in case my wife asks

212
00:10:45,114 --> 00:10:49,246
and she probably will -- what did
this guy do to get his foot cut off ?

213
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,816
Whether it's catching a glimpse
of what the future might hold....

214
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,147
He has diabetes.

215
00:10:58,686 --> 00:11:01,953
Or realizing you've just done
the most embarrassing thing in your life.

216
00:11:01,988 --> 00:11:07,402
Stupid Janitor. Stupid,
stupid, stupid, stupid.

217
00:11:07,571 --> 00:11:09,897
But even that's not as bad as it can get.

218
00:11:09,932 --> 00:11:10,995
Why didn't you tell me ?

219
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:13,532
I just thought that after
I bailed you out of that train wreck code

220
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:15,512
that you could, you know, use a win.

221
00:11:15,547 --> 00:11:17,173
Great diagnosis there, Barbie.

222
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:19,606
It wasn't me. J.D. figured it out.

223
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:23,453
Well, then, nice job, Nancy.

224
00:11:23,488 --> 00:11:27,357
The worst thing is realizing
when a friend is taking pity on you.

225
00:11:30,788 --> 00:11:32,580
I've never been a great liar.

226
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:34,573
Lookin' straight, Bruce.

227
00:11:34,608 --> 00:11:38,367
That's why I knew it'd be better for me
if I just fessed up to Dr. Cox.

228
00:11:38,815 --> 00:11:41,385
Elliot diagnosed Mrs. Kasuba, not me.

229
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:46,331
I know. And your guilty
anguish is-- it's delicious.

230
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:48,632
It's like a little mini-meal
between lunch and dinner.

231
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:51,255
Quite frankly, it's all I can do not
to grind pepper on your head.

232
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,250
I don't get it. When did she
become a better doctor than me?

233
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:57,311
Probably during one of those
countless times you were goofing off?

234
00:11:57,346 --> 00:12:02,030
Eh! As soon as I step foot
in this hospital, I'm all business.

235
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:08,918
Good morning, Dr. Cox !
>From the world's most giant doctor !

236
00:12:10,053 --> 00:12:12,192
Well, that was outside the hospital.

237
00:12:12,227 --> 00:12:16,479
Plus, Elliot was the legs. Sure, she's
skinny, but she's thick through the trunk.

238
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,095
If you could just help me
with these train wreck codes.

239
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,160
You're finally at that stage where
you and your equally undistinguished

240
00:12:22,161 --> 00:12:25,346
colleagues have all had enough training
to be able to help each other.

241
00:12:25,347 --> 00:12:28,009
So no matter how humiliating it may seem,

242
00:12:28,044 --> 00:12:30,207
if you know somebody
who's better than you

243
00:12:30,242 --> 00:12:33,631
and I'm bettin' that you do,
you had best tuck

244
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:38,033
that ridiculously feminine tail of yours
between your legs and go ask her for help.

245
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:40,123
I'm thinkin' that's just about it.

246
00:12:40,535 --> 00:12:41,461
Yep. I, uh,

247
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:45,876
gosh, I'm all out of speeches. I don't
think I have, uh, another one on me.

248
00:12:45,911 --> 00:12:48,198
I...I don't. The--

249
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:51,256
Oh. These are...my goodbye guns.

250
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,447
Those aren't real guns.

251
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,975
Why is my stapler on the floor ?

252
00:13:04,637 --> 00:13:06,563
Thonnnnnnnng !

253
00:13:07,946 --> 00:13:10,811
Face-five ! Oh, yeah !

254
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:15,291
Oh, you taught Todd the slap thing ?

255
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:16,839
Nope. How was surgery ?

256
00:13:16,874 --> 00:13:17,631
Oh, it was fine.

257
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:21,018
Honey bear !
You look blue. Have a cookie.

258
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:22,848
Nah-ah-ah, Laverne. No more jackin' up

259
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:25,741
my man's blood sugar just
so you can buy yourself a camper.

260
00:13:25,776 --> 00:13:28,127
So this is all a big joke to you guys ?

261
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:31,300
'Cause this is my life,
and I don't think it's funny.

262
00:13:31,848 --> 00:13:35,970
Now I gotta try to get back in on
that craps game in the basement.

263
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:42,535
I don't know, this whole Blonde Doctor
situation has me mortified.

264
00:13:42,536 --> 00:13:45,885
I've gathered the brain trust here
to help me figure a way out of this.

265
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:49,410
Uh-oh, bro. There she is.

266
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:50,868
You want me to hobble her ?

267
00:13:50,903 --> 00:13:53,011
That's not hobbling,
that's--that's...poking.

268
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:54,156
What's the matter with you ?

269
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:56,247
Here's a chance to learn
a lesson as a group, okay ?

270
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:59,615
Sometimes you've just gotta face the
music and own up to what you've done.

271
00:14:03,335 --> 00:14:04,720
Hi...Blonde Doctor.

272
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,274
Um, before, when we almost had coffee ?

273
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:09,022
Uh, I feel like I made
you feel uncomfortable.

274
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,213
No, I...wasn't, um--

275
00:14:11,524 --> 00:14:15,468
Well, it-it -- you know the only reason
I was wearing the suit at all was because

276
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:17,941
Our, uh, a cappella band was... practicing.

277
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,906
Oh, that's great !
What's your band's name ?

278
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:24,402
Uh.... It's, uh, Hibbleton.
Yeah, yeah. And, um,

279
00:14:24,403 --> 00:14:29,217
I don't think it's going too far to say that we
are the best hospital employee band in town

280
00:14:30,654 --> 00:14:33,194
Oh, really ?

281
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:36,378
I'll clear his airway !

282
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:38,152
His O2-sat is dropping,
his abdomen is distended,

283
00:14:38,153 --> 00:14:40,080
we need you to do a lavage.
What are you gonna do?

284
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:43,444
Dammit !

285
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:46,912
J.D., it's okay. Look, it's good practice.
It's why we're down here.

286
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:50,159
You know, I don't really like you
guys playing with my cadavers.

287
00:14:50,301 --> 00:14:53,076
Oh, really, Doug ? So how come that one
over there has a soda in his hand ?

288
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,920
He keeps it cold !

289
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:56,894
And how come when we walked in

290
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:59,212
you were sitting in a circle with
three corpses playing Texas hold 'em ?

291
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:01,449
Just call first from now on !

292
00:15:01,726 --> 00:15:04,595
I just, I don't know what to do when
everything goes wrong at once.

293
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,200
It's overwhelming.

294
00:15:05,463 --> 00:15:07,530
You wanna know what my big secret is ?

295
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:11,725
Just take one big breath.

296
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:14,664
Everything will slow down and you
can just tackle each thing as it comes.

297
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:18,132
That's your big secret ? Breathing ?

298
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,768
Why do you have such a problem
with me teaching you stuff ?

299
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:22,707
It's just that you're a little smug.

300
00:15:22,742 --> 00:15:25,905
You called yourself Dr. Diagnosis
and made me your side-kick.

301
00:15:26,324 --> 00:15:28,976
J.D., you've been the golden boy
around here for the past three years

302
00:15:28,977 --> 00:15:32,119
while I have cried in closets
and hid from Dr. Cox

303
00:15:32,154 --> 00:15:34,592
and relied on you every single
day to get me through it.

304
00:15:34,593 --> 00:15:37,697
I mean, now that I am finally
doing well enough to pay you back,

305
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:39,551
maybe you can tell me why
you're being such an unbelievable jerk ?

306
00:15:39,586 --> 00:15:41,761
Because you're the one that's
supposed to struggle -- not me.

307
00:15:52,728 --> 00:15:55,912
Baby. What's going on with you ?

308
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:01,387
Ever since I got this thing ?
I've been joking around about it,

309
00:16:01,422 --> 00:16:05,005
sneaking cookies, and hiding from it.

310
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,480
All because I'm scared to ask myself the questions :

311
00:16:08,515 --> 00:16:12,709
Is it gonna get worse ?
Or are our kids gonna have it ?

312
00:16:12,744 --> 00:16:16,021
Or how old am I gonna be
when it finally gets me ?

313
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,421
You don't understand.

314
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:24,339
I don't understand ?
Turk, look at me, I'm a WOD.

315
00:16:24,511 --> 00:16:26,261
I keep trying to tell you this,

316
00:16:26,262 --> 00:16:28,626
but it's the mirror in the bathroom, baby,

317
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,964
You haven't gained a pound
since I met you !

318
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:34,973
No, I'm a WOD -- Wife Of Diabetic.

319
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:38,028
That's what they call us
in all the diabetic chat rooms.

320
00:16:39,574 --> 00:16:42,137
I spend a lot of time on the computer,

321
00:16:42,172 --> 00:16:47,185
talking about how proud I am of
my husband and how he's handling this.

322
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,464
How he's able to make jokes
about it -- and money.

323
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,985
It's okay to be afraid, I am.

324
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,336
But I have to tell you,

325
00:16:59,371 --> 00:17:05,024
I don't know what I would do if you suddenly
became someone who let somethin own you

326
00:17:34,057 --> 00:17:37,436
Yeah ! Well, you win ! Heh.

327
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:40,809
Your--your band didn't even sing yet.

328
00:17:41,754 --> 00:17:43,521
There's no need. You win !

329
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:48,896
Oh, come on, Janitor ? For me ?

330
00:17:49,815 --> 00:17:51,995
One second. Bring it in.

331
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:55,771
Oh, God.... Okay, I don't ask for much,

332
00:17:55,806 --> 00:17:58,777
just a little help with
a stain every now and then.

333
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:01,609
I'd like to be able
to communicate with animals....

334
00:18:01,644 --> 00:18:05,719
But right now, oh boy,
we need a miracle.

335
00:18:06,593 --> 00:18:11,406
Hibbleton -- whatever
that means -- on three.

336
00:18:11,441 --> 00:18:13,104
Hibbleton !

337
00:18:53,063 --> 00:18:54,662
Hibbleton !

338
00:18:58,683 --> 00:19:01,188
I suddenly found myself
looking down on Mr. Kravitz,

339
00:19:01,189 --> 00:19:03,806
Elliot's train wreck
patient from this morning.

340
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:06,564
Apparently the irony
wasn't lost on him either.

341
00:19:07,524 --> 00:19:10,277
You gotta be kidding, Mr. Kravitz. Twice ?

342
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:13,391
BP's dropping.

343
00:19:13,426 --> 00:19:16,967
He's becoming bradycardic. Doctor !

344
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:29,139
And things did slow down.

345
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,243
Dopamine, run it wide open.
Get me an airway, I need a pacing wire.

346
00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:54,528
No pulse.

347
00:19:54,563 --> 00:19:56,583
I think the second you stop fighting it,

348
00:19:56,618 --> 00:19:58,627
time really is on your side.

349
00:20:01,353 --> 00:20:03,826
And you can go on being who you are...

350
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,067
Or keep enjoying that little crush of yours.

351
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:11,884
To you !

352
00:20:12,497 --> 00:20:14,035
Cheers !

353
00:20:14,361 --> 00:20:18,403
What do you say we go for
the first ever triple giant doctor ?

354
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,851
Oh, Elliot, that's impossible. I mean,
I know you've got strong legs, and you're--

355
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,468
I need you to place an IV

356
00:20:26,469 --> 00:20:27,796
on the second floor, room 208.

357
00:20:27,831 --> 00:20:29,789
Greetings !

358
00:20:30,385 --> 00:20:34,954
I'm the world's most, most giant doctor !

359
00:20:38,184 --> 00:20:39,663
Yeah, sure.

360
00:20:40,432 --> 00:20:43,113
Not that kind of help. Agh !

361
00:20:44,873 --> 00:20:47,453
If I let go, will you guys catch me ?

362
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:48,799
No !

363
00:20:50,363 --> 00:20:52,406
Well, I'm going for it anyway !

364
00:20:52,441 --> 00:20:53,628
