1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,330
Kylie and i still hadn't slept together,

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,590
but I had a feeling her 4-week booty embargo was about to end.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,690
I have a surprise for you tonight.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,410
God, I hope it's sex. Or a pony.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,900
I'll bet it's sex'cause I don't see a pony.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,280
Wait right here.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,940
It's for your scooter.

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,710
What are you doing?

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,380
Nothing, I was just gonna do a little laundry.

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,740
I assume your facilities are in-building?

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,230
Why is it always about sex with you?

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,470
It's not. Look, Kylie, I'm just really proud of my abs.

13
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,470
Or... ab.

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,920
Turk and Carla were having some relationship trouble of their own,

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,540
but at least they were working on it.

16
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,350
Baby, I don't understand why we can't discuss this after the a-team.

17
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,300
Turk, a lot married couples hit roadblocks their first year,

18
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,430
but nothing's gonna get resolved if we don't get our issues out in the open.

19
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,450
Ok, let's do this.

20
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,300
Ok, what's bothering me...

21
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,590
Hey, hey!

22
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,770
There he is!

23
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,770
My buddy hit it and quit it, didn't he?

24
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:06,590
Hell, no.

25
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,840
Hell, yes!

26
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,540
Now if you'll excuse me, it's time for my nightly ritual.

27
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,850
Pleasure myself, weep and repeat.

28
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,880
You see, Turk, this is our problem.

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,970
We're trying to have a serious conversation here,

30
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,820
but you're more concerned about how your other wife is doing.

31
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,680
Ok, you know what bothers me?

32
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,950
Every little thing with you becomes a big issue.

33
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,760
You make mountains out of molehills.

34
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,140
When have I ever made a mountain out of a molehill?

35
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,830
Turk!

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,390
If you can't remember to put the cap on the toothpaste,

37
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,280
how are we gonna raise our children!

38
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,540
You know what, I'm gonna stay with my sister.

39
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,290
I guess I could work on it a little.

40
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,620
Ok, if the patient is in shock,

41
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,390
the first thing we want to try to do is assess intravascular volume...

42
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,950
What? That's right.

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,640
Oh, I know. I wasn't...

44
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,590
you to indicate an incorrect answer, I was...

45
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,620
you because I was bored, and I thought that just might drive you crazy.

46
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,990
Oh, you're a wonderful teacher. Stop...

47
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,730
me in front of my residents.

48
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,740
It's unprofessional.

49
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,740
You're right, Barbie.

50
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,930
Carry on.

51
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,510
So...

52
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,510
When you're dealing with cardiogenic shock...

53
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,030
it's best to start fluid resuscitation...

54
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,960
Bong!

55
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,890
Let's keep moving.

56
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,400
You know, I don't really appreciate you messing with my lady.

57
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,230
Your lady?

58
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,330
Blonde doctor and I are gonna end up together.

59
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,440
And I'm talking the whole shebang. House in the'burbs, volvo in the driveway,

60
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,170
dog-fighting ring in the basement.

61
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,200
I guess it wouldn't be the first time the janitor got the girl.

62
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,590
Oh, wait a minute.

63
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,140
Yes, it would.

64
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,010
You want to place a wager?

65
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,290
I do, but here I really have no need for a cracked thermos and 2 pounds of keys.

66
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,290
How about my van for your Porsche?

67
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,610
I suppose when I win, I could destroy your vehicle and make a watch, couldn't I?

68
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,220
- Bet. 
- Bet.

69
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,190
All right, give me all the details on Kylie.

70
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,490
Dude, it was so naughty.

71
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,180
We're kissing, right, and she's like,

72
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,580
I think it's a little hot in here, starts pulling down her skirt.

73
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,060
Oh, my god. I'm getting turned on by my own fake story.

74
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,470
Damn you, ruptured spleen!

75
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,680
To be continued.

76
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,790
Thank god Turk left, because I can't think about sex anymore.

77
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,900
Luckily for me, there isn't a whole lot of temptation in a hospital.

78
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,150
Howdy, stranger.

79
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,150
Do you still want me?

80
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,980
Yes, please.

81
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,920
Hey, stranger.

82
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,170
Script : Raceman 
Synchro : Siefaz

83
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,010
Scrubs episode 4x19
My Best Laid Plans

00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,150
www.forom.com

85
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,760
So Molly's back in town.

86
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,380
She definitely wants me.

87
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,260
Bye.

88
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,900
How you doing, J.J.?

89
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,140
That's J.D.

90
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,460
Oh, right. I was just thinking of that Jimmie Walker sitcom.

91
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,460
Good times?

92
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,460
Not great. My sister had a miscarriage.

93
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,650
Molly?

94
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,110
- You look fantastic. 
- So do you.

95
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,140
How's milwaukee?

96
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,010
It's ok. I'm just here to see a patient.

97
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,670
Even though she did the fake forget-my-name thing, she's here for me.

98
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,670
I think we all know there's no patient.

99
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,340
They've landed!

100
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,130
Grab some blankets and all the canned goods you can carry.

101
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,590
We're moving to the sewers.

102
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,720
Apparently, he's gotten really possessive of me.

103
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,520
He won't talk to the new staff psychiatrist.

104
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,650
Molly, I'm sure he's not that possessive.

105
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,650
Get away from my doctor!

106
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,830
Get him off! Get him off!

107
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,850
Patrick, down.

108
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,660
It is so good to laugh like this with you again.

109
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,520
I'm on a break here, Newbie,

110
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,530
so tell your shiny-headed roommate if he doesn't shut up,

111
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,790
his first surgery tomorrow will be removing that cell phone from his own ass.

112
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,790
Will you give him a break? He's talking to his wife.

113
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,470
Anybody seen Mr. Jennings' file?

114
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,220
Oh, here it is.

115
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,390
This just got interesting.

116
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,760
Who are you talking to?

117
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,810
Rosanna.

118
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,210
Your college girlfriend?

119
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:08,970
Yeah.

120
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:09,940
Could I say hi?

121
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,460
Yeah.

122
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,080
-Hey, Rosanna. 
-Hi J.D....

123
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,690
Dude, what the hell?

124
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,580
Hello?

125
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,190
Hello? J.D.?

126
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,780
This phone is indestructible.

127
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,380
Even has a camera. I'm so getting one.

128
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,600
Is anybody there?

129
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,780
Dude!

130
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,600
Why are you talking to your college girlfriend?

131
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,040
We're just friends!

132
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,260
Ahh. Just friends.

133
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,510
I was just friends once with a vietnamese girl.

134
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,560
Long story short, I'm on the hook for sending Trong Tri Kelso to college,

135
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,660
and he doesn't want to go to a state school.

136
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,120
Unlike you, Bobbo,

137
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,340
Gandhi here is in a healthy relationship.

138
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,060
I mean, come on, look, even jordan lets me keep in touch with women from my past.

139
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,060
Give me a pound, my dawg.

140
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,680
He gets me.

141
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,310
Give me a pound, dawg.

142
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,530
Does he know you were being sarcastic?

143
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,820
I hope not.

144
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,750
Splendid.

145
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,870
Gentlemen, crazy eyes Margo, I've called the brain trust together

146
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,030
for one reason.

147
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,500
I have to find a way to make blonde doctor mine.

148
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,100
Burn down her apartment.

149
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,630
I have an idea,

150
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,080
but we're gonna need a tugboat.

151
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,680
Tugboats and arson.

152
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,260
That's all I ever get from you guys.

153
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,350
We call this a brain trust,

154
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,040
and I'm the one with all the solutions.

155
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,180
I saved you from that eagle, Randall.

156
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,900
I saved your job, Troy.

157
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,710
And, Margo, I found your birth mother.

158
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,130
She was a tree person, remember?

159
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,220
There's no shame in that.

160
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,030
Sorry, guys, but I've had enough.

161
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,830
I'm afraid I have to find a new brain trust.

162
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,520
Gentlemen...

163
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,220
I don't want to appear selfish, but stop what you're doing and focus on me.

164
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,530
So, you seeing anyone?

165
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,470
I went on a few dates with a guy named Rick, but then he met my mom and it all fell apart.

166
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,440
She didn't like him?

167
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,670
No. She loved him.

168
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,840
They're in Aruba.

169
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,690
God, I'd love to get with Molly.

170
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,360
Dude, you're pretty horny for a guy who claims to be getting it on a nightly basis.

171
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,230
What are you implying?

172
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,630
Well, let's just say a little birdie told me that you and Kylie haven't slept together.

173
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,370
Who?

174
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,600
Nurse birdie.

175
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,260
Well, you haven't.

176
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,930
I trusted you.

177
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,740
Dude, it's been a month.

178
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,380
Oh, really, Turk? Has it been a month?

179
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,350
Because time just flies when you're dry-humping your way through 3 pairs of cords.

180
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,100
Look, Kylie hasn't slept with you, so what she's saying is, she doesn't want to be exclusive.

181
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,390
Is she dating?

182
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,940
She did go to a movie with her brother-in-law.

183
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,840
That's perfect.

184
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,560
Dude, you can have your cake and eat it, too.

185
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,670
It's like me talking with my old girlfriend.

186
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:33,580
It boosts my self-esteem, and I take all of this positive energy back to Carla.

187
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,530
Now, this is what you do.

188
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,480
You go out with Molly and you have a great time while she's in town,

189
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,440
but once she leaves, you go to Kylie and you tell her you want to get your exclusive on.

190
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,060
That is the dumbest idea I've ever heard.

191
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,700
So once you got the hole in the bottom of the popcorn box,

192
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,430
it's basically just a waiting game.

193
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,610
And for the record, that technique does not work with hot nachos.

194
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,220
You want to get Elliot, you get in good with her best friend.

195
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,610
Who's Elliot?

196
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,380
Trust me.

197
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,970
The way I got my girlfriend in junior high was by getting her best friend to like me.

198
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,580
And how'd you do that?

199
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,490
Oh, I posed as her dad so she could rent a car.

200
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,250
I lost my hair in eighth grade.

201
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,560
Tough break five.

202
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,920
I'm going in.

203
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,720
Um, we should be friends.

204
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,720
Ok.

205
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,260
Do you like vanning

206
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,930
I don't know what that is.

207
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,310
It's kind of my thing.

208
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,900
It's like taking a long drive in a car,

209
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,310
only it's in a van.

210
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,030
I'm still not getting it.

211
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,530
Can you hold on for one sec?

212
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,200
She's an idiot.

213
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,560
Turk, I found your cell phone in the parking lot.

214
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,000
4 stories and not a scratch. What are you made of!

215
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,680
You got 3 missed phone calls, all from a Rosanna.

216
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,650
Isn't that your ex-girlfriend?

217
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,700
So, what's been going on with you?

218
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,180
I went to India for 2 weeks.

219
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,620
Ladies, this is a hospital, not the junior league.

220
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,900
Let's break it up.

221
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,820
And, dr. Clock, I feel as though I've been seeing less and less of you recently.

222
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,420
We don't pay you good money to go hide in your office. Let's get out there on the floor.

223
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,530
I moved to Milwaukee 4 months ago.

224
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,800
Welcome back.

225
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,790
So, this trip to india sounds so exotic.

226
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,940
Hey, Kylie, I'm just calling to see how your day is going.

227
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,490
And sweat would just be dripping off our naked bodies.

228
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,080
Naked sweat drips.

229
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:38,880
What?

230
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,930
Oh, nothing, Kylie. It's a new band called the naked sweat drips.

231
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,930
They have a great song called perfect breasts.

232
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,400
And then, I got so flexible, I could put my legs behind my head.

233
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,810
J.D., Are you there?

234
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,080
You should come.

235
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,720
Oh, frick on a stick. Look, I gotta get going.

236
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,510
I want to hear the rest of the story.  Don't forget where we were.

237
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,510
Feet up behind her head.

238
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,510
Who has their feet behind their head?

239
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,960
A patient, Kylie.

240
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,380
Horrible car accident.

241
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,070
You gotta wear your seat belt, I'm tellin' ya, even around the block.

242
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,050
Hey.

243
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,240
I'm getting out of here. Do you wanna grab a beer?

244
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,750
They say the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.

245
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,750
I can't believe you've been talking to her.

246
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,520
Now, honey,

247
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,840
is it possible you're making mountains out of molehills

248
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,500
Damn it.

249
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,570
Still, sometimes plans go exactly like they're supposed to.

250
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,390
You paged me

251
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,720
Yeah, look.  I made a bet with dr. Cox that you would go out with me.

252
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,960
And if I win, I get his porsche.

253
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,920
And the success of those plans can take even the most hardened men by surprise.

254
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,210
Do you mind?

255
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,740
I am trying to have a private moment with my man.

256
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,490
Oh, god.

257
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,060
I got lipstick on you.

258
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,450
No. Leave it.

259
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,060
And sometimes even the best of men can go awry.

260
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,060
So are you coming over tonight?

261
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,060
Hey, J.D.

262
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,040
Buddy, you should try that cake I was telling you about.

263
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,850
Actually, Kylie, I.. I can't tonight.

264
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,550
If having my cake and eating it, too, meant being with Molly, then nothing was gonna get between us.

265
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,920
Hey, guys, you going out?

266
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,550
Yeah, you should come with us!

267
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,090
That's the close button.

268
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,390
I know, it's a close button.

269
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,310
When someone gets close, it activates a sensor that opens the door.

270
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,560
Fancy.

271
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,830
Oh, no, she's got a pinkie hold.

272
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,100
Elliot's got the finger strength of a rock-climbing jazz pianist.

273
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,900
You were pressing the wrong button.

274
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,040
I'm so excited. So where are we going?

275
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,600
We haven't decided yet!

276
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,930
I gotta tell you there, supercuts,

277
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,760
I've seen a lot of crazy things at this hospital.

278
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,860
I've seen smokers live to be 100, and I've seen tri-athletes come in here and drop dead at 20.

279
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,170
I've seen unbridled joy,

280
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,170
and I've seen debilitating pain.

281
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,230
But I never thought I'd see a jumpsuit-wearing, van-driving,

282
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,230
vomit-cleaning, no-good, confounded,

283
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,990
frankenstein-looking buffoon like you get a girl like Barbie.

284
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,120
I'm gonna paint your porsche mint green so it looks like my van's baby.

285
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,850
Not until you get your grades up!

286
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,160
Rosanna gets her own personal ring tone, but I don't?

287
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,160
Baby, I don't have to answer this.

288
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,330
It's cool.  I got the ring that matters, right?

289
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,600
Nurse Turkelton, I want to talk to you about these discharge...

290
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,510
We can talk later.

291
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,810
You need to come get a drink.

292
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,040
Yes, I do.

293
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,410
Janitor.

294
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,920
So, did dr. Cox pay up?

295
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,160
Uh, no. No.

296
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,470
He says that he needs to see us on an actual date

297
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,470
in a restaurant tonigh at 8.

298
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,290
Ok. Meet me at Stanwyck's

299
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,540
Sure.

300
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,670
Ok.

301
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,810
Sorry, guys, can't go clubbing tonight.

302
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,020
Daddy's got a date.

303
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,650
Oh, man!

304
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,190
I ironed my going-out hair!

305
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,880
You know, they make thongs specifically for low-riders now.

306
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,910
They don't work for me. I still can't sit down without showing the whole world the crack of my ass.

307
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,250
The other night, some guy tried to put a pen in it.

308
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,160
Some guy... I never get credit for anything.

309
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,120
So, you guys think I'm overreacting about this whole Turk thinga?

310
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,120
Phone calls from an ex would drive me nuts.

311
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,800
I knew how to get rid of both of them, but I can't do that to Turk.

312
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,630
If you don't do it, I will.

313
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:57,820
Mr. Peeps?

314
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,000
Why are you british

315
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,980
I'll explain later.

316
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,980
Just lose the extra bitches.

317
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,930
Carla.

318
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,170
Go talk to Turk. Share with him your feelings.

319
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,370
That's what he wants.

320
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,250
Yeah.

321
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,740
Come on.I'll drive you. I gotta go to dinner anyway.

322
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,220
You're welcome.

323
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,300
We should probably go, too. It's getting late.

324
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,310
Oh, no, no, no. I just ordered 2 drinks.

325
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,070
Here they are.

326
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,540
Hey, Turk?

327
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,710
I promise, I will visit you soon.

328
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,360
I don't care if I seem crazy.

329
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,930
Please stop talking to your ex.

330
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,930
Anything for you, you know that.

331
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,250
College was weird. I was so worried about being liked

332
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,630
that I let my freshman roommate think we were dating for 3 months.

333
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,400
We broke up at her sorority formal.

334
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,910
Oh, nobody could snuggle like Daisy.

335
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,370
Didn't you say dr. Cox was coming at 8?

336
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,810
Oh, I'm sure he'll be here soon.

337
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,950
I kissed a dude once.

338
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,590
It was at furnace camp.

339
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,060
Ok, J.D., you're a little drunk,

340
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,770
and you know what happens when you get drunk.

341
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:14,820
You get handsy.

342
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,230
Now control yourself.

343
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,840
It's tough making new friends in Milwaukee.

344
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,230
I said control yourself!

345
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,550
You know, Molly, if people aren't getting to know you, then they're missing out.

346
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,960
Do you think so?

347
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,010
I do.

348
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,330
I knew at that moment what would happen if I reached over and brushed the hair out of her eyes.

349
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,910
But I didn't do that.

350
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,590
I should get going.

351
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,960
I'm sorry.

352
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,850
Well, if it isn't marginally attractive and the beast.

353
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,850
How did the porsche drive?

354
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,180
Wait, why did we just go out if you already have his car?

355
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,180
Oh, my goodness.

356
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,680
He actually tricked you into a date.

357
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,630
This is so very delicious and filling,

358
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,580
I don't think I'm going to be able to eat the rest of the evening. In fact,

359
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,620
I honestly don't think I can have one more bite of your painful humiliation.

360
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,420
I find I'm just a little stuffed.

361
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,160
I will take my keys to go, though.

362
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,450
Yippee!

363
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,490
You're unbelievable.

364
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,670
You're the only one around here that treats me like a real person.

365
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,210
What did you just say?

366
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,920
There was one other girl a few years ago.

367
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,090
Red-haired doctor.

368
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,430
She used to eat lunch with me until the other residents started making fun of her.

369
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,920
They called her...

370
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,590
janitor lunch eater.

371
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,070
Not the most clever group.

372
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,140
Anyway...

373
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,600
I know that you don't think about me the way that I think about you, and I...

374
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,760
never really believed that you would or that you could, but...

375
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:38,160
just pretending for today somehow made me feel good for a change.

376
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,220
I'm sorry.

377
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,540
You know what, it's ok.

378
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,700
I actually had a good time.

379
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,930
Thanks.

380
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,430
Elliot.

381
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,430
Oh, Kylie, I'm sorry.

382
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,050
I hope it's ok that I stopped by...

383
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,270
What was that for?

384
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,460
I was thinking about how patient you've been with me, how right things feel,

385
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,960
and then you showed up, and it feels like fate.

386
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,140
Wait, are you saying that you're ready?

387
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,730
Awesome.

388
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,680
First, let me set the mood.

389
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:29,200
And, Kylie, you're right, it is fate because I was out with this girl tonight that I...

390
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,650
totally could have had sex with,

391
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,680
but it was easy for me to blow her off because I was excited to be with you.

392
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,320
Why have you stopped lighting incense?

393
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,080
It makes the room smell like chinese rain.

394
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,300
You blew me off tonight to be with some random girl?

395
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,920
Well, she's not a random girl.

396
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,980
I mean, I had a crush on her long before I met you.

397
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,480
I will kill you.

398
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,910
You should go.

399
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,470
I was in trouble, and if I didn't play my cards right, I knew what could happen.

400
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,990
Unfortunately, that's what did happen.

401
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,540
See, that's the thing about trying to have your cake and eating it, too.

402
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,550
If you make the slightest mistake, you usually wind up getting neither.

403
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,050
We can fix that.

404
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,830
You guys are out.

405
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,100
You guys are back in.

406
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,730
Where's Margo?

407
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,050
She's at a Ludacris concert with her birth mom.

408
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:03,300
I lose my van to him, and I lose margo to gangster rap.

409
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,360
Bad day.

410
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,750
And, really, who wants to risk something important just for a silly piece of cake?

411
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:13,890
I did it.

412
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,190
Cut off all ties with Rosanna. Forever.

413
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,640
Baby, that took like 20 seconds.

414
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,970
How'd you do that so quickly?

415
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,970
It was easy. I just told her I was married.

416
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,020
You've been talking to this girl you used to sleep with,

417
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,260
and you never told her you were married?

418
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,010
She never asked.

419
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,010
It's no big deal.

420
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:38,130
Because if you're lucky, maybe you won't be married for much longer.

421
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,110
Baby.

422
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,630
Baby!
