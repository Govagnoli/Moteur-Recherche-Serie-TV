1
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:04,030
"I was a little nervous today. "

2
00:00:04,031 --> 00:00:07,383
"Maybe it was because I had no idea
who this guy on the back of my bike was. "

3
00:00:10,325 --> 00:00:11,457
See ya tomorrow!

4
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:12,458
Will do.

5
00:00:14,935 --> 00:00:17,642
"Or maybe I was nervous because at 3 o'clock,

6
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,987
"Dr. Cox was gonna name me
the new chief resident. "

7
00:00:19,988 --> 00:00:21,127
"How do I know?

8
00:00:21,228 --> 00:00:23,428
"Well, for one thing, I'm the only one who applied. "

9
00:00:23,528 --> 00:00:26,034
"But I'm also the only one who's
truly focused enough to...

10
00:00:26,035 --> 00:00:26,735
Oh God!

11
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:31,229
So lemme get this straight:

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,104
You crashed in to their truck
and they just drive you to work?

13
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:35,444
Well, we didn't come straight here.

14
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:40,021
Come on, Dorian.
You gotta want it!

15
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:43,166
Hold up. They made you move furniture?

16
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:44,504
It wasn't all bad.

17
00:00:44,505 --> 00:00:48,683
Bubble wrap! Bubble wrap! Bubble wrap!

18
00:00:52,897 --> 00:00:56,063
"Dr. Molly Clock, the new attending psychiatrist.

19
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,272
"Yes, she was HOHHHT!"

20
00:00:58,273 --> 00:00:59,573
"But I wasn't a fan. "

21
00:00:59,674 --> 00:01:01,776
"For one thing, she's always calling me Johnny. "

22
00:01:01,977 --> 00:01:03,204
"Also, she wasn't very nice. "

23
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:05,851
Hey, sit with us. We'll make room,
even if I have to stand.

24
00:01:05,852 --> 00:01:08,234
"Quelle Salope. "

25
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:10,350
"Plus, she's _always_ with Elliot... "

26
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:12,958
"and since I dumped her,
we weren't getting along all that great. "

27
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:15,006
Anybody got any extra ketchup packets?

28
00:01:16,427 --> 00:01:17,368
Thank you, Elliot.

29
00:01:18,115 --> 00:01:20,510
So, what are you guys gonna do now
that your residencies are over?

30
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:22,156
Oh, I'm still a resident!

31
00:01:22,157 --> 00:01:24,903
Yeah, Dr. Kelso said I'm the first medical resident

32
00:01:24,904 --> 00:01:27,936
to repeat his third year in
the entire history of the hospital!

33
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:29,765
That's a bad thing, Doug,

34
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:30,966
Oh, I'm staying positive.

35
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:34,153
Well, I'm starting my endocrinology
and metabolism fellowship.

36
00:01:34,154 --> 00:01:37,304
I'm really looking forward to cataloguing
all of the genetic variations of...

37
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:39,368
Oh, really?

38
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:42,454
Well, excuse me for taking an interest in
hormonal regulatory research and relate...

39
00:01:45,257 --> 00:01:48,082
You know, Elliot, I still think you'd make
a good chief resident.

40
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,895
Carla, for the five billionth time,
I'm not interested.

41
00:01:50,996 --> 00:01:53,518
I think you would be a great chief resident!

42
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,519
You do?

43
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,017
- I just said that.
- I know.

44
00:01:56,018 --> 00:01:58,138
Sorry, ladies, job's taken.

45
00:01:58,139 --> 00:02:01,420
Dr. Cox is naming ass-face, here, at 3.
It's too late.

46
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,619
Well maybe it's not too late.

47
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,720
Yeah it is, Carla.

48
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:04,921
Maybe it's not.

49
00:02:04,922 --> 00:02:06,560
You know what, you're right, Molly.
Maybe it isn't!

50
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:08,248
- What the hell?
- They're all against you!

51
00:02:08,249 --> 00:02:10,250
I'm invisible, I'm invisible, I'm invisible...

52
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:11,151
Dr Cox?

53
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:12,251
Damn it!

54
00:02:13,404 --> 00:02:15,913
Can I still be considered as a candidate
for the chief residency?

55
00:02:15,914 --> 00:02:17,594
She asked, without a prayer.

56
00:02:18,295 --> 00:02:19,936
Sure, why not.

57
00:02:23,302 --> 00:02:25,931
Raise it! Raise it! Uh-oh, uh-oh!

58
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:28,473
And grind. Grind it, grind it!

59
00:02:28,574 --> 00:02:29,674
You okay, buddy?

60
00:02:30,075 --> 00:02:32,221
"I just needed to talk to someone. "

61
00:02:33,852 --> 00:02:35,182
Tough break, J.D.

62
00:02:35,283 --> 00:02:36,766
You've dreamed of being chief resident

63
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:39,246
ever since you were a little boy
growing up in Trotwood, Ohio.

64
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:41,105
"What? How does he know that?"

65
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:43,027
Merci, Franck.

66
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,120
So whatta you think, Perry?

67
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,121
I don't know what to tell you, there, Bobbo.

68
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,350
Either this kid has a lightbulb up his butt

69
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:12,810
or his colon has a great idea.

70
00:03:13,274 --> 00:03:14,727
Excuse us, Lyle.

71
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:15,728
Come on, Newbie.

72
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:18,011
Hey, do you have a magazine?

73
00:03:18,012 --> 00:03:19,778
Not in me... I mean, on me.

74
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:23,927
That young man's father is very important.

75
00:03:23,928 --> 00:03:26,300
Don't tell me. He donated a wing.

76
00:03:26,301 --> 00:03:28,717
He donated a wing, a thigh, and a breast.

77
00:03:28,718 --> 00:03:29,518
Sir?

78
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,143
Yes, genius, in this metaphor,
the hospital is a chicken.

79
00:03:32,557 --> 00:03:34,159
Please, sir, I totally get that.

80
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:36,034
" How could a hospital be a chicken?"

81
00:03:36,035 --> 00:03:37,505
Focus on nothing else.

82
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,450
What a jerk!

83
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:42,898
Hey, when Elliot asked you if
she could run for chief resident

84
00:03:42,899 --> 00:03:44,520
and you said "why not,"
that was just a goof, right?

85
00:03:44,663 --> 00:03:47,165
Dr. Cox. Ran all those tests on Mr. Landisman.

86
00:03:47,514 --> 00:03:49,339
Top-notch work, there, Barbie!

87
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,989
She's good!
She's very, very, _very_ good!

88
00:03:55,608 --> 00:03:56,914
Now, sorry, where were we?

89
00:03:56,915 --> 00:03:58,467
I am a medical professional,

90
00:03:58,468 --> 00:04:00,354
and you are not gonna get me
to compete with Elliot.

91
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:02,471
Well, Jo-Jo, right now she's winning.

92
00:04:02,472 --> 00:04:03,779
Let me know how to get back on top.

93
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,854
I'll do anything, even if it means
I have to kill somebody!

94
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:08,062
Well, you could start
by getting the lightbulb out

95
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:09,375
of this genius's pooper.

96
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,594
Impress me.

97
00:04:11,843 --> 00:04:13,461
Oh, I'll impress you!

98
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:16,470
Hit the water!

99
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:21,854
"I'll impress him some other way. "

100
00:04:21,855 --> 00:04:23,913
Doug! Stay positive.

101
00:04:26,576 --> 00:04:27,687
Awesome!

102
00:04:29,814 --> 00:04:32,367
Perry! You know, I have a cousin named Perry.

103
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:34,049
But actually, no, he's not my cousin...

104
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,789
and, you know, his name isn't Perry
it's... Jeff.

105
00:04:37,326 --> 00:04:38,390
That's so funny.

106
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:40,332
I have an uncle named Stop Bothering Me.

107
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,333
Interesting!

108
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:42,999
Anyway, this morning Dr. Kelso told me

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,663
that since psychiatrists are
the Wal-Mart greeters of medicine...

110
00:04:45,764 --> 00:04:48,398
...that I need to start publishing
a paper to earn my keep.

111
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,231
So I'm gonna do this study about
conflict resolution between hospital personnel

112
00:04:52,232 --> 00:04:54,161
and I was wondering if I could observe you?

113
00:04:54,162 --> 00:04:58,729
Look, "Doctor," us real doctors
are here to work,

114
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,762
so there's not a whole lot of conflict.

115
00:05:00,763 --> 00:05:02,608
Now, my day is already bad enough

116
00:05:02,609 --> 00:05:05,029
on account of I gotta tell Mr. Roman that he..

117
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,387
That... Oh, my God.

118
00:05:07,388 --> 00:05:09,800
Mr. Roman doesn't need to have surgery.

119
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:13,348
I ne-hever get to give good news!

120
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,878
Subject elongates words when excited!

121
00:05:19,316 --> 00:05:20,826
Mr. Roman, ga-reat news!

122
00:05:20,827 --> 00:05:24,073
I don't need surgery!
Yeah, Dr. Turk just told me!

123
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,274
Yeah, you shoulda seen him!

124
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:26,729
He was so happy, he started dancing!

125
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,689
Not standing up,
but while lying in his bed.

126
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:30,738
It was sort of like buh-buh-buh
from like the waist up?

127
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:37,956
You stole my moment. And you will pay.

128
00:05:42,423 --> 00:05:43,633
Oh, this is good!

129
00:05:45,796 --> 00:05:48,425
Molly helped me fill out
my chief resident application so...

130
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:49,826
...gonna go give it to Dr. Cox!

131
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:51,874
There you go, working girl!

132
00:05:52,892 --> 00:05:55,948
I've told Elliot a million times that
she would be a good chief resident,

133
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:57,109
but she just ignored me.

134
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,884
Maybe she's racist.

135
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:00,649
Whatever. It's fine, it's fine.

136
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,367
It's not like all my friends are
gonna go to Molly for advice.

137
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,291
Nurse Roberts, if you still wanna talk about
that situation with your husband,

138
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:08,392
we can go to my office now.

139
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:13,928
'Scuse me.

140
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:21,168
"When Turk told me he pissed
Dr. Cox off by stealing his moment,

141
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:22,769
"I decided not to share it with Elliot. "

142
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:23,870
Dr. Cox!

143
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:26,021
Can you come take a look
at my patient's rash?

144
00:06:26,022 --> 00:06:27,122
It's really weird.

145
00:06:27,123 --> 00:06:30,520
Ohh, I would love to come
take a look at your patient's rash!

146
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:32,303
But, also, if time allows,

147
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:36,015
maybe we could go over some preliminary
ideas for your wedding dress.

148
00:06:36,216 --> 00:06:37,760
I have sketches in my locker.

149
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:38,961
Pssst! Barbie!

150
00:06:38,962 --> 00:06:41,431
Listen carefully, because
the policy remains unchanged:

151
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:46,266
Unless someone is dying...
and puh-lease note _dying_ not _dead_...

152
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:47,380
I'm not interested.

153
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:51,585
And P.S., just a real strong showing
for a chief resident candidate.

154
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,633
God almighty!

155
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,365
Don't feel bad,
you couldn't have seen it coming.

156
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:00,666
Awful, though.

157
00:07:01,883 --> 00:07:03,850
Well, I'm off to pilates.

158
00:07:04,151 --> 00:07:07,560
"I didn't feel bad, because a lot of people
were playing dirty around here. "

159
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,011
I've told him all about the surgery,
and he is good to go.

160
00:07:11,012 --> 00:07:13,843
Hey! So whatta you say
we yank out that gallbladder?

161
00:07:13,844 --> 00:07:16,143
That's the way you tell me
I need major surgery!?

162
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,468
You said you told him!

163
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:18,469
Oh, stop it.

164
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,727
Why would I steal your moment?

165
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:24,313
Except for maybe because
payback is a bitch.

166
00:07:27,606 --> 00:07:30,109
Have one, baby.
You'll feel better.

167
00:07:30,144 --> 00:07:33,713
Turk, I heard your conflict
with Dr. Cox escalated?

168
00:07:33,894 --> 00:07:36,938
You know, he's already starting to look like
the breakout character of my case study?

169
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:38,157
The one that people love to hate?

170
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,211
Anyway, in my opinion,

171
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:42,682
it is more effective to address the situation

172
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:46,523
than it is to become self-destructive by
over-indulging a sweet tooth.

173
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:51,217
She's right.

174
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:53,037
You don't have that cookie,
we're getting a divorce.

175
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:54,121
But baby, I'm not hungry now.

176
00:07:54,122 --> 00:07:55,122
Eat. It.

177
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:03,285
What?

178
00:08:03,286 --> 00:08:04,245
It's 3 o'clock!

179
00:08:04,246 --> 00:08:06,111
3 o'clock's when you announce
new chief resident,

180
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:07,112
- so we thought you might want...
- Barbie!

181
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:09,407
You're chief resident.

182
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:11,609
Very funny!

183
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,996
So not joking.

184
00:08:15,523 --> 00:08:18,636
Oh, my God, now I know how Liza Minelli felt!

185
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:21,659
When she won the Oscar, not when
she married that gay, pan-faced alien.

186
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:25,401
Newbie, how ya doin'?

187
00:08:25,402 --> 00:08:27,729
"Keep it together. It's be a man time. "

188
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,943
No, no. I totally understand.

189
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:32,322
Come on, you did what you had to do.

190
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:35,444
You went with your gut;
Elliot's a great doctor.

191
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,644
I do have three questions, though:

192
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:41,969
Why do you hate me when
I show you nothing but love?

193
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,353
Who's gonna tell my mom?

194
00:08:43,354 --> 00:08:46,100
And what the hell am I
supposed to do with ten thousand

195
00:08:46,101 --> 00:08:48,719
"John Dorian, Chief Resident" business cards!?!?!

196
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:54,430
Yeah, Scarlett? You're chief resident too.

197
00:08:55,747 --> 00:08:57,026
Uh, what now?

198
00:08:57,027 --> 00:08:59,769
Well, I figure with her being
ridiculously book-smart

199
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,115
to the point where she has
almost no interpersonal skills,

200
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:05,698
and you being warm and cuddly as
an un-potty trained labradoodle...

201
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:10,000
and about as useful in high-stress medical
situations as an un-potty trained labradoodle...

202
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:17,452
_together_ the two of you make one
barely passable doctor... slash labradoodle.

203
00:09:17,553 --> 00:09:19,985
Wait, so, if we're both gonna be chief residents,

204
00:09:19,986 --> 00:09:21,375
why didn't you just say that from the beginning?

205
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:23,471
What, and miss your hall of fame hissy?

206
00:09:23,472 --> 00:09:25,597
Not on your life.
Walk with me.

207
00:09:28,204 --> 00:09:29,788
John Dorian, chief resident.

208
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:36,302
It's just that Elliot and I doing this together
is gonna be a little tough...

209
00:09:36,303 --> 00:09:38,254
we're going through a bit of a rough patch.

210
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:39,055
Shoot, I totally get that.

211
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:41,365
What you need to do is
just give each other tons of space.

212
00:09:41,366 --> 00:09:43,742
Here, uh, here's your office.

213
00:09:48,376 --> 00:09:50,447
Oh! Enjoy.

214
00:09:53,263 --> 00:09:57,713
Maybe I wasn't clear.
This patient is important.

215
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,208
Translation: Don't pass him off to dumb guy.

216
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:02,189
Sir, I take issue with that.

217
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,249
Son, you were gathering
a group of large orderlies

218
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,770
to get the lightbulb out of
the patient by doing what?

219
00:10:06,771 --> 00:10:08,358
Shaking him like a beach towel.

220
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:09,659
Goodbye!

221
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,467
Last chance, Perry. Fix this kid.

222
00:10:14,637 --> 00:10:17,014
I paged a surgical consult.

223
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,803
'Course you did.

224
00:10:19,404 --> 00:10:22,033
Heard this guy's got
a lightbulb up his ass.

225
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:24,757
Are... are you the...
the surgical consult?

226
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,816
No, I'm not even working today.

227
00:10:26,817 --> 00:10:29,025
I just want to ask him four questions.

228
00:10:29,526 --> 00:10:34,379
Whasssup! Dr. Tizzurk is in the hizzouse...!

229
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:37,679
"Conflict is everywhere. "

230
00:10:37,714 --> 00:10:39,597
"Whether it's out in the open... "

231
00:10:40,568 --> 00:10:42,607
"... or bubbling just under the surface. "

232
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,705
You know what I realized
by doing this study?

233
00:10:44,706 --> 00:10:46,402
Some of the most interesting
conflicts are when

234
00:10:46,403 --> 00:10:48,854
one of the parties doesn't even
realize they're in a fight!

235
00:10:50,023 --> 00:10:51,086
Really.

236
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:55,689
"I guess the only thing to do
when you're in the middle of it

237
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,446
is to hope that nothing makes it worse. "

238
00:10:58,447 --> 00:11:00,021
Cleaning time!

239
00:11:00,622 --> 00:11:02,296
Don't worry, I'll go fast.

240
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:05,415
Whoop, that one got away.

241
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,812
Ammonia burns? Hm! Write that down.

242
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:14,097
Yes, I'm happy!

243
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:16,499
But I'd be happier if I didn't have
to share the job with such a jerk!

244
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,694
Elliot. I can hear you.

245
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:20,917
You guys, the situation
would be perfect for my study.

246
00:11:21,118 --> 00:11:22,318
Oh, no.

247
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:23,319
Don't worry, Johnny.

248
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,063
Everyone's gonna be anonymous,
I'm only using initials.

249
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:26,169
You'll be "J.D."

250
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,586
Great. Maybe we could make it permanent.

251
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:29,987
Johnny...

252
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:31,422
"Of course not. "

253
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:32,423
The way I see it,

254
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:34,509
you guys can either get past it
and talk like adults,

255
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,661
or you can behave like petty children.

256
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,483
"We decided to go petty. "

257
00:11:38,484 --> 00:11:40,039
Okay, instead of sharing you all,

258
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,189
we're gonna separate you
into two resident teams

259
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,060
so that J.D. and I never
have to see each other.

260
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:46,030
I'll take Doug.

261
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:47,491
YES! Suck on that!

262
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:51,276
Thanks, J.D. First pick.

263
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,214
Relax, Doug, you're the only one
whose name I know.

264
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,404
I'll take Indian Elvis.

265
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:57,836
Pick the hot chick.

266
00:11:57,837 --> 00:11:59,891
Shut up, Doug!
We'll take the hot chick?

267
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:04,665
Yeah, uh, name's Amy, actually.

268
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,924
John Dorian, chief resident.
Website's on the back.

269
00:12:08,618 --> 00:12:11,445
Hey! I got like a two-hour
break between patients,

270
00:12:11,446 --> 00:12:12,346
do you wanna grab lunch?

271
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:14,630
Or dinner, I'm not really sure
what time it is.

272
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:16,959
"Elliot and I weren't the only ones
who decided to go petty. "

273
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:20,182
Oh! You know what,
I have a barbecue to go to.

274
00:12:20,183 --> 00:12:22,188
Why don't you meet me there?

275
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,389
Cool!

276
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:28,196
- Hey! Are you Todd?
- Oh yeah...

277
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:30,269
Well, Carla said you're having a barbecue.

278
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,612
No, but stick around, I'll see
if we can get something cooking.

279
00:12:34,013 --> 00:12:35,747
This is Pat and Frank from 4G.

280
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:37,248
Hi, I'm Molly.

281
00:12:39,286 --> 00:12:41,080
Aaand you're naked.

282
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,021
Awesome.

283
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:49,360
Why don't we just reach up there
and tug that bad boy out?

284
00:12:49,761 --> 00:12:51,577
It's not a rabbit in a hat.

285
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:53,534
If you tug on it, it's going to break;

286
00:12:53,535 --> 00:12:55,707
and if it breaks,
he's going to need surgery;

287
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,756
and if you perform it, then, of course,
he's going to need a casket.

288
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:03,556
Sooo, why don't you just play quietly
in your area until the crowd arrives.

289
00:13:03,557 --> 00:13:06,614
What crowd? I thought nobody
wanted to take the case?

290
00:13:06,615 --> 00:13:09,600
At first. But now that it's become
a bit of a hospital mystery,

291
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:12,601
every jackass in the joint is going
to want to come in here

292
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,184
and give their two cents worth.

293
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,853
If we could just find the lamp the bulb came from.

294
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:22,402
Leon's trained to retrieve things.

295
00:13:24,577 --> 00:13:26,795
That's why my wife and I use candles.

296
00:13:26,996 --> 00:13:32,050
Zeltzer, you are hands-down the most
disturbing man I've ever met in my life.

297
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:35,122
Oh, stop it.
Hey, are you and your wife open-minded?

298
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:36,123
That's it!

299
00:13:36,124 --> 00:13:39,411
I want everybody to get out
who is not an expert on lightbulbs!

300
00:13:39,412 --> 00:13:40,412
Go on! Get out!

301
00:13:41,702 --> 00:13:44,026
Out out out out out out
out out out out out!

302
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:45,731
What're you still doing here?

303
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:50,040
What you have there is
an A21 bulb on a E26 base.

304
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,406
Running a hundred watts, putting out about
a hundred and thirty volts.

305
00:13:53,407 --> 00:13:55,775
Get over here, you're helping me.

306
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:58,002
Not so fast, cowboy.
You're working with me, tall man.

307
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,203
Mmmm, actually, no.

308
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:01,877
If I had the time, maybe,
but I've got a room to clean.

309
00:14:06,175 --> 00:14:08,621
Keep up, people!
We got pre-rounds to do!

310
00:14:09,222 --> 00:14:10,798
Get the lead out, Elvis!

311
00:14:12,734 --> 00:14:14,096
Okay, she's gone.

312
00:14:14,297 --> 00:14:16,579
Now, I've heard some rumors that

313
00:14:16,614 --> 00:14:20,241
there's been some fraternizing
with some of Dr. Reid's residents.

314
00:14:20,242 --> 00:14:22,211
Now, I don't want to mention any names...

315
00:14:22,212 --> 00:14:24,487
but, Slobodan, enough of that crap!

316
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:26,692
Watch your ass.

317
00:14:26,693 --> 00:14:28,521
Now, come on, you nerds!

318
00:14:30,013 --> 00:14:32,996
Carla, Todd has something
he wants to say to you.

319
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:35,632
I'm sorry if I ever demeaned you, Carla.

320
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:37,504
You see, my feelings about
women were warped

321
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:40,421
by a very unhealthy relationship
with my mother.

322
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:42,480
We made out once.

323
00:14:43,476 --> 00:14:45,421
That's good, Todd. Keep going.

324
00:14:45,422 --> 00:14:47,851
Monique! I owe you an apology...

325
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:50,170
You fixed the Todd?

326
00:14:50,371 --> 00:14:53,492
Well, without regular therapy,
it'll probably only last... a week.

327
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,486
So... you're mad at me.

328
00:14:57,471 --> 00:14:58,906
Excuse me?

329
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,081
Oh! You're not mad at me!

330
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,588
Why did you just close your eyes at me?

331
00:15:04,676 --> 00:15:05,589
I've never been able to wink.

332
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,157
Ohh. I'm not mad.

333
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,732
Cool! You're obviously
very stubborn and very proud,

334
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:13,368
but you're nice so
eventually you're gonna tell me.

335
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:16,093
- No, I won't.
- Let go of that anger!

336
00:15:21,143 --> 00:15:23,038
Not my office.

337
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:24,958
How's it going in here?

338
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,721
GO AWAY!

339
00:15:26,722 --> 00:15:28,989
Wow, you kinda harmonized on that.
That was cool.

340
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,104
It's funny, it's not about the argument
anymore between you two

341
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:34,480
it's a competition about who can be
stubborn the longest.

342
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:36,861
If you think about it,
the real winner is gonna be

343
00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:39,162
who has the guts to apologize first.

344
00:15:41,477 --> 00:15:43,009
I GOT SOMETHING TO SAY!

345
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,472
I'm sorry about the gallbladder
thing this morning! Yes! I win!

346
00:15:45,473 --> 00:15:46,473
DAMMIT!

347
00:15:46,474 --> 00:15:49,574
It's just, you surgeons ride in here,
on your white horse and you save the day

348
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:53,041
and the best news that I ever get to give
everybody, anybody, ever, is

349
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:56,724
were you aware that the breathing
tube you have in your neck

350
00:15:56,725 --> 00:15:58,525
also comes in day-glo pink?"

351
00:15:58,526 --> 00:16:02,958
Come on, look, bottom line:
I really needed a win, I did.

352
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,363
And I finally got one and you
... ya... you stole it, man!

353
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:08,064
I needed one, too!

354
00:16:09,489 --> 00:16:11,145
Where's my win?

355
00:16:11,146 --> 00:16:13,834
Think anybody thanks me
for cleaning bathrooms?

356
00:16:13,835 --> 00:16:15,850
Janitor, the bathrooms are filthy.

357
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:18,047
Well, no one was thanking me,
so I quit cleaning 'em.

358
00:16:18,048 --> 00:16:18,922
Holy cow.

359
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:23,056
Do you realize if we could get a tight
enough clamp around the bulb and then just...

360
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:24,457
No, no, no, you'll break the thing!

361
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,195
Look, here's the thing about lightbulbs, okay?

362
00:16:26,196 --> 00:16:27,985
They're structurally weak at the narrow end,

363
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:30,117
but the round end is surprisingly strong.

364
00:16:30,118 --> 00:16:32,018
So if we could get behind the bulb...

365
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:34,032
I see where you're headed!
We go down through the mouth!

366
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:35,233
Your turn's over.

367
00:16:35,234 --> 00:16:38,266
All we need to do is thread
an angioplasty balloon

368
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:39,958
past the bulb, inflate it..

369
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,439
...and then pull.

370
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,877
I concur.

371
00:16:57,252 --> 00:17:00,524
Doug wanted me to give this patient
five hundred thousand milligrams of Morphine.

372
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,125
I thought I'd check with you
before I killed a man.

373
00:17:02,226 --> 00:17:04,088
Unbelievable, Doug.

374
00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:08,655
Don't worry, I just came to check on my patients.

375
00:17:08,656 --> 00:17:10,926
Do whatever you want,
just don't come over to my area.

376
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:12,925
You couldn't pay me
to come over to your area.

377
00:17:12,926 --> 00:17:15,065
- Well, I wouldn't pay you.
- Well, you don't have enough money.

378
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,203
It just so happens I have a rich uncle
who'd do anything for me,

379
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,124
but I'd never call in that favor just
to pay you to come over to my area!

380
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,125
"Got her!"

381
00:17:22,126 --> 00:17:23,537
I hate to interrupt,

382
00:17:23,572 --> 00:17:25,494
but I think you need
to take a look at this man.

383
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,672
Elliot, he's in V-tach.

384
00:17:28,273 --> 00:17:29,221
Get the crash cart.

385
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:30,637
We need a one milligram Epi.

386
00:17:30,638 --> 00:17:32,062
"The best thing about this place is that "

387
00:17:32,063 --> 00:17:33,630
"when someone's really in trouble,"

388
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:35,331
"all the pettiness melts away. "

389
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:39,358
What are you doing?

390
00:17:39,821 --> 00:17:41,886
Oh, um, I'm tired of trying
to find my office,

391
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,444
so I just set up shop here!

392
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:45,781
Oh! Okay, that's not weird.

393
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:49,120
Look, I wanna apologize for my wife.

394
00:17:49,221 --> 00:17:50,121
She'd never admit it to you,

395
00:17:50,122 --> 00:17:53,445
but she likes to be the person around here
who tells everybody what to do.

396
00:17:53,446 --> 00:17:55,849
Apparently she can't get enough of it at home.

397
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:58,626
Right? Right? Wrong.

398
00:17:58,727 --> 00:18:02,043
Look: If every once in a while

399
00:18:02,044 --> 00:18:04,704
you could let her be the one
to give the advice?

400
00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:06,705
You guys might end up being friends.

401
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:07,923
I can do that.

402
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:12,518
And tell Carla that you did well.

403
00:18:14,288 --> 00:18:17,763
You truly underestimate how proud my wife is.

404
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:20,409
If she knew I was here, she'd kill me.

405
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:21,639
All right.

406
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:29,611
What happened to the part about
how much I help people around here?

407
00:18:29,612 --> 00:18:31,573
Wait a second, she said I did well!

408
00:18:31,574 --> 00:18:34,756
Turtlehead! You're gonna wanna get
a piece of this! Come on.

409
00:18:34,857 --> 00:18:36,590
Where'd you get the coat?

410
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:39,069
I earned it. Let's get our moment.

411
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:42,880
Thanks for all the hard work, Bob.

412
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:43,881
Glad to do it.

413
00:18:43,882 --> 00:18:47,339
Oh, and, uh, Bart,
I think Lyle might be ready

414
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,518
for that rough-sex-play talk
you had with your other boys.

415
00:18:52,058 --> 00:18:53,236
Too late!

416
00:18:56,025 --> 00:18:58,437
Can you imagine us trying
to do that three years ago?

417
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,932
I know.
Remember our first code?

418
00:19:01,286 --> 00:19:03,835
Well, I remember hiding
in a supply closet.

419
00:19:04,136 --> 00:19:05,495
That's the one.

420
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,832
"Ultimately, conflict is resolved
by remembering why"

421
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,462
"you were friends in the first place. "

422
00:19:10,863 --> 00:19:12,753
Don't hang up, Lester.

423
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:19,465
You should talk to her.
You know her better.

424
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:21,043
"Or by swallowing your pride. "

425
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,196
I know what you're doing.

426
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,297
But I'm okay with it.

427
00:19:32,843 --> 00:19:35,785
He's coming. He's coming!
Get your ass out here!

428
00:19:35,786 --> 00:19:38,605
"Or by uniting against a
moment-stealing common enemy"

429
00:19:38,606 --> 00:19:42,601
who took credit for your ingenious method
of de-bulbing a patient's keister!"

430
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,022
Good Lord!

431
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,961
"In the end, though, it doesn't really
matter how you get there.

432
00:20:03,296 --> 00:20:05,072
"As long as you're friends again. "

433
00:20:05,473 --> 00:20:10,825
I miss this...
This, like, hanging out, you know?

434
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,426
Me too.

435
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,481
We should go get coffee.

436
00:20:15,453 --> 00:20:16,847
We're having coffee.

437
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:20,525
No, no, I mean like, like outside coffee...
Real world coffee.

438
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,826
The point is, we should... hang out
outside the hospital sometime.

439
00:20:25,931 --> 00:20:27,672
J.D., I still need time.

440
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:31,614
I know that's gonna be hard for you because
you like to fix everything right way, but...

441
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,978
you just do the best you can, okay?

442
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,243
Is it fixed now?

443
00:20:41,244 --> 00:20:42,444
<i>Nope.</i>

444
00:20:42,445 --> 00:20:43,445
"Shoot!"
