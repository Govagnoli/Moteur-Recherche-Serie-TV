00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,000
<i>I'm a sick man. Last night, after three years of chasing Elliot,</i>

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,900
<i>I convinced her to dump her perfect boyfriend and
then immediately realized I don't want her.</i>

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,600
<i>What the hell's wrong with me?</i>

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,600
<i>Luckily she doesn't have to get up until 9 and she's an incredibly heavy sleeper.</i>

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,800
Ooh! Ooh! Ooog!

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,300
<i>An incredibly heavy sleeper.</i>

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,900
Wow.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,300
<i>I knew I needed to talk this over with someone who understood me.</i>

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,300
<i>Someone I had recently been intimate with.</i>

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Yeah?

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,700
Okay, not him.

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,300
J.D., this is Larry. Larry, this is J.D.

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,100
I think I'll go put on some underwear.

14
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,800
Please, Larry!

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,200
What the hell you doing with that guy?

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,400
I don't know. I thought it'd be cool to date a celebrity.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,800
He's not a celebrity!

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,700
<i>Wait a second!</i>

19
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,600
Are you the Soup Nazi from 'Seinfeld'?

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,100
No.

21
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,500
Say the soup thing.

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,600
No!

23
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,700
Dammit!

24
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,200
Turk! We're getting married tomorrow!

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,600
Yeah....

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,500
Why aren't you excited?

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,600
'Cause, baby, we've been here for an hour 
and you've already said it like thirteen times.

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,000
But we're getting married tomorrow!!!!

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,400
Have you been working on your vows?

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,000
Define "work."

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,300
It's the difference between special birthday 
sex and no sex on our wedding night.

32
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,600
Yeah, I do like the special birthday sex.

33
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,200
Turk, when I asked you if you wanted to 
write your own vows, you said yes.

34
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,700
Baby, I'm on top of it, all right? I promise 
you this weekend'll go off without a hitch!

35
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,200
Oh, hey, how did it go picking up my 
brother at the airport this morning?

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,700
I'm sorry, what?

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,900
How could you forget him!?

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,800
You two have enough trouble getting along as it is!

39
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,100
Baby, I'm joking!

40
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,700
Aww.

41
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,500
Hey, Marco! The invites said no dates!

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,700
No da--....

43
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Look, Danni, the reason I'm here is

44
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,100
well, first of all I wanted to give you back your skull lighter.

45
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,100
Secondly, you always seem to have some insight in to why I'm so messed up.

46
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,200
I mean here I-I chase after Elliot for three years, now I don't want her!

47
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,700
Well maybe it's 'cause you idealize women 
and no one can live up to your standards.

48
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,300
Why would I idealize women?

49
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,800
 What's your mom like?

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,200
I love you, honey.

51
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,500
You're the smartest, handsomest, sweetest boy in the whole world.

52
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,700
And no matter how hard you look, you will never 
find a woman who'll love you as much as I do.

53
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,900
I know, Mommy.

54
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,700
My mom is perfect.

55
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,600
Look, kid, you're just confused.

56
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,600
All you need to do is focus on the little things you love about her.

57
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,600
Like...the way she puts out a cigarette...

58
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,900
or how when she finishes a beer, she looks 
inside the can just to check if there's any left.

59
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,800
Hm?

60
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,000
Sweetie, it's 5 to 9, and my Denver omelet's not gonna make itself.

61
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,400
It's 5 to 9?! I gotta go!

62
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
<i>Oh, he is so the Soup Nazi! Trick him!</i>

63
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,400
What is it again? It's like, you're out of luck in the soup department?

64
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
NO SOUP FOR YOU!

65
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,300
Ha! Rad.

66
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,900
Oooog! Ow!

67
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,200
What are you doing?

68
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,600
Just lying here, watching you sleep.

69
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,400
Awww.

70
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,100
<i>I don't think my hang-up with Elliot has anything to do with my sexy, amazing mom.</i>

71
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,000
<i>And I'm not that much of a commitophobe.</i>

72
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,700
<i>Maybe I just don't feel I deserve someone as 
great as Elliot because I have low self-esteem.</i>

73
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,600
Do you know that you have really nice hands?

74
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,500
"Nice"? Elliot, these are the hands of a god!

75
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,400
Heh!

76
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,400
<i>Fine, so it's not the self-esteem thing.</i>

77
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,200
<i>Then Elliot and I got to witness an event that 
many had spoken of, but none had ever seen.</i>

78
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,200
The arrival of the janitors!

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,800
Good morning!

80
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,000
Is it? Is it really?

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,400
No, I was--I was kidding.

82
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,900
I'd stay out of his way today. He just lost the election for union president.

83
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,000
Who won?

84
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,800
Congratulations, sir.

85
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,600
Hey.

86
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,800
Welcome to work, boys! Be the best janitors you can be today!

87
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,000
No hard feelings, brah.

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,900
Oh, there's hard feelings.

89
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,400
Grrrrrrrrrrr...hah! Eh?

90
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,500
All right.

91
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,000
Nyah! What the? Oh! It's like a mechanical vice!

92
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,700
Change is good.

93
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,500
Sweetheart, I slept like a log.

94
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,800
Really. See, I didn't notice, 'cause I was up all night with Jack.

95
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,100
Tell me this: How do you not scare him when you go in there?

96
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,300
Do you wear a nanny mask, or do you just slap 
on a nametag that says "Hi, I'm your mommy"?

97
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,500
I refuse to be judged by a grown man wearing a hockey jersey.

98
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,200
Which reminds me -- Jimmy's mom called,

99
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,900
and if you guys win the big game today, she's 
gonna take everybody to Chuck E. Cheese!

100
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,100
Say the word and I'll go out and buy a whole new wardrobe;

101
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,200
and to pay for it we'll just sell one of your shoes!

102
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,000
Great! We made him cry!

103
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,200
If we keep this up, we're gonna scar him for life!

104
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,000
I don't necessarily buy into all that new agey crap.

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,800
One time I saw my mom knock my father unconscious with a frying pan.

106
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,400
You know what I did? I kept right on going with my birthday party.

107
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,400
I am not fighting with you anymore. Ever!

108
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,800
How 'bout this way: I love that you get 
cold when it's seventy-one degrees out.

109
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,200
I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich.

110
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,000
I love that you get a little crinkle above your 
nose when you're looking at me like I'm nuts.

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,900
I love that after I spend a day with you, I 
can still smell your perfume on my clothes.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,900
And I love that you are--

113
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,100
TuPac! I was watching that!

114
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,800
Dude! I gotta do my vows!

115
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,300
Oh, come on, man! That was 'When Harry Met Sally' -- it was a classic!

116
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,200
Oh, yeah, dude! You know, I was gonna rent that the other night,

117
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
but then I remembered I'm a heterosexual.

118
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,300
Too bad you couldn't remember to go to the airport.

119
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,600
You told her?

120
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes, Turk, he did.

121
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,000
Now, if you two can stop your petty crap for just one second,

122
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,600
maybe we can focus on what this wedding weekend is supposed to be about.

123
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,500
Love.

124
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,200
No! ME!
Promise me you'll get along.

125
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,300
Okay.

126
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Idiot.

127
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,500
Tattletale.

128
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Get outta my face.

129
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
What?

130
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,300
I'm just saying the next person that gets 
in my face is gonna wish they hadn't.

131
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,800
<i>Sociopath!</i>

132
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,000
Catch me, stud!

133
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,600
You know, most guys woulda caught me.

134
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,000
I love that you didn't!

135
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,600
Oh! Cool!

136
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,300
Maybe Elliot's just not the right fit for me. I mean, 
I'm the kinda guy who likes stupid movies.

137
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,900
Hey, let's rent 'Kangaroo Jack' tonight!

138
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,300
<i>And I have uncontrollable hostility towards small rodents.</i>

139
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,200
Or we could just go shoot rats at the dump!

140
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,700
<i>Dammit, she's perfect on paper! What the hell's wrong with me?</i>

141
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,400
What?

142
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,400
Nothing. I just love the way you drift off in your head sometimes.

143
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,700
<i>I guess the Soup Nazi was right, it is the little things that are important.</i>

144
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,400
<i>Like when Elliot blows the bangs out of her face.</i>

145
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,100
<i>Or how she's the only person I know who sneezes with her eyes open.</i>

146
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,500
Atchoo. Ahem. 'Scuse me.

147
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,000
<i>And that's when I realized that I really liked all 
those things about Elliot, but I didn't love them...</i>

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,800
<i>and I didn't love her.</i>

149
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
You're the best.

150
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,100
See you later.

151
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,500
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

152
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,300
Oh, my God! That board meeting went on forever!

153
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,500
It was so dull, I had to read pamphlets just to stay awake.

154
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,900
Good news is? Don't have testicular cancer.

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,700
Tell me, did ya happen to come across any pamphlets on people who

156
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,700
only work eight days a year and then spend the other 357 whining about it?

157
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,400
What part of "I'm not fighting with you anymore" do you not get?

158
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,700
If you want someone to fight with, you 
have to find someone else. Mm-hmm.

159
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,700
Oh, good. Here you're wetting down the floor for the older folks.

160
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,600
Please say that you're talking to me.

161
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,300
I don't see anybody else around, soap jockey.

162
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,200
Chew louder.

163
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,600
Turk, I need your help, man. It's about Elliot.

164
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,800
Why, did you sleep with her again?

165
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,100
How does everybody know about this?

166
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,700
Turk, I'm not in love with her, man. What am I supposed to do?

167
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,300
It's killing me that I could be hurting her.

168
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,800
You're a very loud chewer.

169
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,700
Dude, I would love to help right now, but 
I'm in the middle of writing my vows.

170
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,700
And all I've got so far is, "Let's give it up for the caterers!

171
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,400
WOO! Good chicken!"

172
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,600
So now that you're gettin' married, it's all about you.

173
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,600
No, now that I'm getting married tomorrow, it's about me.

174
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,000
Ooh, still seems that you can take a minute for a friend.

175
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,100
I know!

176
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,700
Shut up, Marco!

177
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,100
 That was a mistake.

178
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,600
Why's that? Because you're afraid you can't take me?

179
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,400
Nnnooo. It's 'cause of this. Boys!

180
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,500
You know where to take him.

181
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Where to take me?

182
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,900
Wait, who's taking me wh--? Maintenance? Maintenance? Uh-oh.

183
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,600
We-hey. ___ now. The maintenance brothers!

184
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,700
That was Father Paul. He said we can't read our own vows,

185
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,000
we have to use the same Catholic ones like everyone else.

186
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,200
No!

187
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,200
Yeah.

188
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,300
Noooo!

189
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,500
Aw, baby, Carla, that sucks. 'Cause you know,

190
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,000
I was gonna totally blow you away.

191
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,000
Since you guys worked so hard,

192
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
why don't you just read 'em at the rehearsal dinner tonight?

193
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,700
That's a fantastic idea!

194
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,800
Isn't it, Turk?

195
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,500
Super!

196
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,000
Awesome! I'm gonna go work on them some more.

197
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,700
Unfortunately for me, I wasn't in love with Elliot.

198
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,500
But I'm a man, and even though it was gonna 
be tough, I knew exactly what I had to do.

199
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,700
Ready to go? I say we pick up some 
Chinese and hang at home tonight.

200
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,800
Awesome!

201
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,700
<i>I was going to stay with her for the rest of my life.</i>

202
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,200
<i>Once you embrace a relationship and decide that you're really in,</i>

203
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,600
<i>everything becomes easier. And I am in, baby!</i>

204
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,600
So, my parents are coming to town next week.

205
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,100
We must eat with them!

206
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,300
Oh. All right.

207
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,600
Hey, Elliot. Thanks for letting me crash at your place

208
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
while Carla's family's in town for the wedding.

209
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,900
Oh, it's not problem. See ya, roomie.

210
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,400
<i>And now we live together.</i>

211
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,000
What the?

212
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,700
Sheila!

213
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,500
Aaagh!

214
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,200
Lgh mm ogh rm um ghna kghl ghu!

215
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,400
I can only assume you're saying "Let me out 
or I'm gonna kill ya" -- not gonna happen.

216
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,400
Listen, I'm in a rare position of power here, okay?

217
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,700
So I'm only gonna let you out if you admit that you're my mentor.

218
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,600
I know! I know that makes you angry, but--

219
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,700
Uh-oh!

220
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,100
Okay! Okay! You know, I'm fine the 
other way! However you wanna do--

221
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,800
Dr. Cox.

222
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,200
Why is your mouth red?

223
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,300
Duct-taped two hours in a morgue drawer;

224
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,800
don't piss off the Janitor; end of story.

225
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,700
...'Kay... I'm ordering more pens. Do you 
like twisty bottoms or clicky tops?

226
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,300
I can't imagine anything I care less about.

227
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,500
Damn these twisty bottoms. We need some more clicky tops.

228
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Not gonna happen, Bob.

229
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,100
Here I just told Carla to order a hundred thousand twisty bottoms.

230
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,900
Nice face. But can't you just order a box of clicky tops for me?

231
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,500
No, Bob. Everybody gets the same.

232
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,400
Fine. I'll just take these.

233
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,100
You just bought yourself four weekends on call!

234
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,600
Damn twisty bottoms!

235
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,900
You just said you didn't care. Why are you fighting?

236
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,200
I can't stop!

237
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,000
Baby, you mean so much to me. That's why you my baby.

238
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,600
And, yeah, there were babies before you, but I promise you, baby,

239
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,700
you will be my baby forever, baby.

240
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,700
Stop saying "baby"!

241
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,000
You're not even dressed yet!? We gotta 
pick up Carla on the way, man!

242
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,700
You know what, tell her I couldn't come up 
with anything, so I guess I don't love her.

243
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,500
Gimme that.

244
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,400
For what?

245
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,700
 I'm gonna write your vows for you.

246
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,000
Ooh! A clicky top!

247
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,500
Does this mean we're amigos?

248
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,500
No. It means that I love my sister, and she deserves 
to hear something beautiful said about her.

249
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,300
And I'm positive if your life was on the line,

250
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,300
you couldn't squeeze one eloquent coherent 
thought out of that tether ball you call a head!

251
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,500
Thank you!

252
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,500
God, I can't remember the last time I saw you in this suit and tie.

253
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,800
How can you not remember that time we were with those--

254
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,200
Oh, God! With the two guys!

255
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,600
--the two guys, and their mom was trying to sing that song!

256
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
It was so funny!

257
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,400
So funny.

258
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,900
Till they had to...put their horse down.

259
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,500
Oh, yeah....

260
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,700
Poor Cinnamon.

261
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,800
He could run like the wind, but his tail couldn't put out that fire.

262
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,300
Yeah.

263
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,100
God, we have so much history together.

264
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,300
So great to finally be able to call you my boyfriend.

265
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,200
Boyfriend?

266
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh, should I not have said that?

267
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,100
No it's just...it's nice to hear it out loud.

268
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,000
<i>And it was nice.</i>

269
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,100
<i>I mean, here I was having my tie tied by this beautiful woman 
who happened to be one of my closest friends,</i>

270
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,200
<i>and I realized that this is what a relationship is supposed to feel like.</i>

271
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,700
There. It's perfect.

272
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,700
Yeah, it is.

273
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,200
What's going on with you?

274
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,300
Let's see, Jordan and I aren't, uh...we're not fighting anymore.

275
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,300
Oh, no.

276
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,200
How long has this been going on?

277
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,400
Since the baby came along we've been fighting less and less.

278
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,500
Why don't you get a hotel room?

279
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,200
Pour some nice champagne, get in a tub, and rip each other new ones.

280
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,800
You know, make it special.

281
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,300
She won't go for that!

282
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,100
Well, you have to do something.

283
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,900
No I don't, you jackass!

284
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,500
Ha ha! Sweetie, you ain't getting any here. I'm getting married tomorrow.

285
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,400
Please?

286
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,500
No. No. No.

287
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:59,100
...And most of all, I wish our mom was with us tonight.

288
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:06,600
Not because she was taken too early, but because 
she would see how happy you've made me,

289
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,400
and she would love you forever for that.

290
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,000
And Christopher--

291
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,900
Yes?

292
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,800
--I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, but you've managed to erase them all,

293
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,000
because each and every one of them has led me to you.

294
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,100
Wow. That's a hard act to follow.

295
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,600
Carla, I love that you get cold when it's seventy-one degrees out.

296
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,700
I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich.

297
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,000
I love that you get a little crinkle above your 
nose when you're looking at me like I'm nuts.

298
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,300
Yeah, like you got right now! Just like that one!

299
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:51,200
I love that you're the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night.

300
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,300
Turk!

301
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,400
Dude, I'm workin' here.

302
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,900
And it's not because I'm lonely, and it's 
not because it's our rehearsal dinner.

303
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,900
I came here tonight because, when you realize you 
wanna spend the rest of your life with someone,

304
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,400
you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.

305
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,500
Turk.

306
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,700
Yeah, baby?

307
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,500
That's the speech from 'When Harry Met Sally'.

308
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,900
Those pants make your ass look giant.

309
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Stop doing this.

310
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,700
I'm doing it for us. You suck at Scrabble.

311
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,900
Do I look mad?

312
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,900
You got so much Botox in your expressionless face, I can't tell.

313
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,500
Oh, is that a frown?

314
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,400
What else you got?

315
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,600
Well, when it's my turn to listen to the baby monitor,

316
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,700
I just wait till you're asleep and I turn it off!

317
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,100
Perry, give it up. There's nothing you can say!

318
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,900
Oh.

319
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
You and your mother are basically the same person.

320
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,400
What did you say!?

321
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,300
I'm gonna kill you!

322
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,600
If you don't wanna fight in front of Jack anymore, I understand that.

323
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,300
But I don't think that means we gotta stop altogether.

324
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,900
I mean, Jordan, you are an unpredictable, passionate person,

325
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,600
and you challenge me each and every day.

326
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,500
And, honestly, that's the reason I can imagine being with you

327
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,100
when I'm seventy and you're sixty-five and your 
face is forty and your boobs are twenty-nine.

328
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,600
My face'll never look forty.

329
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,800
You're right, my bad.

330
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,100
Oh, my God. My future brother-in-law is an evil genius!

331
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,500
I'm gonna go, uh, check on "Sally"! Ha!

332
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,500
Okay, not funny yet.

333
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,300
So I take it you haven't broken up with her yet.

334
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,100
Yeah, I decided to stay with her forever.

335
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,800
That's great, dude.

336
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,300
I know you think you're being nice, but I'm pretty sure

337
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,800
Elliot doesn't want to spend her life with someone who doesn't love her.

338
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,000
Oh, you know what?

339
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,400
If it's okay with you, I'm gonna go ahead and take relationship advice

340
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,500
from someone whose fiancee is currently speaking to him.

341
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,100
Ohhhh!

342
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,800
Ohhhh-ho!

343
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,000
Gimme some champagne! I need a victory sip!

344
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,500
Cheers.

345
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,100
You're making a big mistake.

346
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,400
Come on, man. Elliot and I are like best friends.

347
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,700
We love hanging out with each other. Maybe that's love.

348
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,600
I mean, who--who knows what love really is?

349
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,500
 I do. J.D., when I look at Carla, I see the future.

350
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,700
I see kids, I see minivans, I see a beer gut -- on me, of course, not her.

351
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,600
I hope so.

352
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,200
But you know what's really weird?

353
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,700
None of that stuff scares me. Not even when--

354
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,600
Turk.

355
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,700
Dude, I'm trying to make a point here.

356
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,500
I know. Maybe you should stand up and say that.

357
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,800
Carla.

358
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,800
When I look into your eyes, I see the future.

359
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:42,800
I see kids, I see minivans...you name it, I see it.

360
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:51,000
The weird thing is, though, as long as I see 
your smile, none of that stuff scares me.

361
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,300
<i>Listening to Turk made me think a lot about love.</i>

362
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,800
<i>Like how sometimes it can be hard to understand.</i>

363
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,800
Why didn't you tell me you felt that way, you dumbass?

364
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,900
Because you're so much like your mother, 
you wouldn'ta listened anyway.

365
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,600
No biting.

366
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,800
Just take it, you girl.

367
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,900
Mmm.

368
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,900
<i>Other times, love's obvious to everyone.</i>

369
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,400
...Anyway, uh...

370
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:26,600
...I may not ever be able to tell you how much you mean to me,

371
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:34,900
but I promise I will try to show you...for the rest of my life. I love you.

372
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,500
I love you.

373
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,700
Aren't they amazing?

374
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,500
I don't love you.

375
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,300
What?

376
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,700
Please don't cry.

377
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,800
Oh, I won't.

378
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,400
Oh-ho!

379
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,100
Oh, God! Someone call 9-1-1!

380
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,300
Oh, could I get a little more wine, please?

381
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,300
This chicken is fantastic!
