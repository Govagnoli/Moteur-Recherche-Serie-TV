1
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:04,629
"At Sacred Heart, there are certain
things you can always count on."

2
00:00:05,274 --> 00:00:08,179
"Dr. Kelso will systematically break Ted's spirit..."

3
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:09,398
Oh, Ted.

4
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:14,526
I meant to tell you eight months ago, all those
days of vacation you saved up expire...

5
00:00:14,568 --> 00:00:18,602
Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight...

6
00:00:18,647 --> 00:00:19,543
- Now!
- But sir!

7
00:00:19,566 --> 00:00:24,227
I was going to visit The Alamo with
the guys from my public sp...

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,864
Speaking class!

9
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:30,369
"...Turk will start a fight with Carla
that he'll inevitably lose..."

10
00:00:30,392 --> 00:00:33,703
I don't understand it. This wedding is supposed to
be about us, how come I can't be comfortable?

11
00:00:33,716 --> 00:00:36,639
And I don't know how many times I have to
tell you that you are not wearing sweats!

12
00:00:36,651 --> 00:00:39,340
All right, fine! I don't have to wear sweats,
I'll wear the slacks! But you know what?

13
00:00:39,352 --> 00:00:41,594
I'm also wearing the cape,
and we gonna have a wind machine,

14
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:45,328
and I'ma be standing on the altar like:
"I DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"

15
00:00:45,352 --> 00:00:48,534
I'm marrying this! This is gonna be my husband!

16
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:52,069
"...Sean and Elliot will do whatever they can to
keep their long-distance relationship going..."

17
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:53,865
I love the new camera phone you got us.

18
00:00:55,474 --> 00:00:56,906
Really?

19
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:01,885
Did you get it?

20
00:01:02,237 --> 00:01:03,388
No?

21
00:01:07,908 --> 00:01:10,456
"...And the janitor will think of
new ways to torture me."

22
00:01:12,346 --> 00:01:14,542
Don't open your locker for
the next couple of days.

23
00:01:14,788 --> 00:01:15,880
Why?

24
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:26,131
"Still, all you need to break the pattern
is for something shocking to happen."

25
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:29,172
"Like, say, Dr. Cox being in a good mood."

26
00:01:29,372 --> 00:01:33,348
You know, Kyle, after three long years of
watching you climb that transplant list,

27
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:36,549
I finally have a liver with your name on it.

28
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,516
Check Mr. Iverson into Sacred Heart
for the last time, will ya?

29
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,158
"You see, when Dr. Cox is in a good mood..."

30
00:01:42,182 --> 00:01:47,160
"Well, it flows out of him like a cool breeze that
lifts the spirits of everyone it touches."

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,895
Ohhh, it's gon'ta be a great dayyy...

32
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,334
Not today!

33
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,378
Life's too good!

34
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,617
Chicken.

35
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,985
Come on, Turk!

36
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,850
I got two minutes left on my break, how
long is this surgery gonna take?

37
00:03:02,873 --> 00:03:04,752
Carla, cut the guy some slack.

38
00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:07,781
Surgery is not as easy as it looks.

39
00:03:07,816 --> 00:03:11,069
I mean, he's gotta make the incision,
cut the wrong artery...

40
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:16,047
Panic, collapse into a ball of tears in the corner,
and after all that he's gotta go wash up...

41
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,278
Check the board, and find out who
he'll be killing after lunch.

42
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:20,344
It's... a grind.

43
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:22,076
You know, you're always taking shots at Turk,

44
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,076
but you've never really told me what
you think of him as a person.

45
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,787
Me-me-me-me, me-me-me-me-meeee...

46
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:30,888
Ah, there's the right pitch.
Um, I think that---

47
00:03:30,912 --> 00:03:33,448
Oh... hold that thought.

48
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:37,687
I would LOVE to hear what you have to say.

49
00:03:38,062 --> 00:03:39,848
I don't think so, there, bowling ball.

50
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:42,161
Well, you might as well spill it,
Carla tells me everything.

51
00:03:42,184 --> 00:03:45,566
Except, of course, about that curling
iron you have in your locker.

52
00:03:46,024 --> 00:03:47,397
It slipped!

53
00:03:50,403 --> 00:03:52,634
It's back!
Look, if it makes it easier...

54
00:03:52,657 --> 00:03:54,512
You can just pretend I'm Carla.

55
00:03:54,524 --> 00:03:56,720
I can totally do this.

56
00:03:56,732 --> 00:03:58,587
- Carla!
- Wha-at?

57
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,290
I think that your fiancé is a self-involved,

58
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:05,690
bobble-headed jock itch who is not good
enough for you. Not now, not ever.

59
00:04:09,812 --> 00:04:11,557
Carla, if your wedding ceremony's
gonna be in Spanish,

60
00:04:11,558 --> 00:04:13,757
then how will I know that
you're officially married?

61
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:17,279
Because all my cousins will throw tortillas
in the air and fire their guns.

62
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,701
Really?

63
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:21,977
God, I wish I was ethnic!

64
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,265
"It's always hard to work with
terminally ill patients."

65
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:27,308
Ted's helping Maggie with her will.

66
00:04:27,331 --> 00:04:31,253
Thanks again, Ted. How'd you get
through sixty pages so quickly?

67
00:04:31,276 --> 00:04:34,963
Well, Miss Hibersol, it helps to not
really know what you're doing.

68
00:04:34,998 --> 00:04:37,886
Stop it, Ted!
You're a great lawyer.

69
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,763
OhOhh, I love her.

70
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:44,368
Maggie, you seem...
so at peace with everything.

71
00:04:44,862 --> 00:04:47,351
There's really only one thing I'll regret...

72
00:04:48,102 --> 00:04:50,498
I'm thirty-eight years old and I'm a virgin.

73
00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:51,596
- Me too.
- Elliot!

74
00:04:51,597 --> 00:04:52,318
Sorry, sorry.

75
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,197
It's just a reflex from college when I used to play
the tambourine in a Christian rock band.

76
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:58,470
Which was... bull because everyone
was sleeping with everyone.

77
00:04:58,494 --> 00:05:00,772
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

78
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:04,506
I guess I was just waiting for someone
special, and now I feel like...

79
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:09,085
I've missed out on one of the fundamental
experiences of life for no good reason, you know?

80
00:05:09,284 --> 00:05:11,116
Is there anything we can do?

81
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,828
Don't people sometimes pay for sex?

82
00:05:13,852 --> 00:05:15,543
Oh, boy, do they.

83
00:05:15,555 --> 00:05:17,592
I slept with Jenny Johnson's older
brother in high school,

84
00:05:17,593 --> 00:05:21,793
and then he decided to tell all of his friends
what my orgasm face looked like.

85
00:05:22,236 --> 00:05:25,934
Then three of them posed like that for their
yearbook photos! Paid for that one for years.

86
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,248
Elliot, I think she means pay
"money" for sex.

87
00:05:28,272 --> 00:05:30,538
Oh, I got a story about that,
too... not about...

88
00:05:30,561 --> 00:05:32,475
Me, though, my mom...

89
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:34,553
She gets lonely.

90
00:05:43,336 --> 00:05:46,154
Isn't it great being so comfortable with
someone, you don't have to talk?

91
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:48,338
Hmm.

92
00:05:49,536 --> 00:05:51,943
Anyway, the point is, silence is awesome.

93
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:54,233
I'm sorry, I'm just a little preoccupied.

94
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:57,134
I accidentally walked in on my sister
and Perry this morning.

95
00:05:57,427 --> 00:05:59,470
Can you imagine?

96
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:05,962
Relax, Newbie, the gimp is chained up.

97
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:08,509
Be careful, though, Randall got loose.

98
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:09,801
Who?

99
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,711
Why?

100
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:19,089
Powerful tiny fists....

101
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,922
I gotta get out of there.

102
00:06:20,957 --> 00:06:22,566
You think maybe I could crash at your house?

103
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:24,796
Sure. Just bring your own toilet paper.

104
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,509
It's... kind of a little rule we
have with our guests.

105
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:30,292
Preferably something two-ply!

106
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:31,666
How's it going, Danni?

107
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:33,498
Great. I'm crashing at your place tonight.

108
00:06:33,522 --> 00:06:35,318
Oh, cool....
Bring toilet paper.

109
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:36,727
I already told her.

110
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:38,442
How'd you get Dr. Cox to like you?

111
00:06:38,477 --> 00:06:40,297
- Dr. Cox said he liked me!?
- No, you're missing the point...

112
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,700
I need to know three things immediately:
Where was he when he said it,

113
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:44,701
What inflection did he use,
and had he been drinking?

114
00:06:44,724 --> 00:06:46,059
You know what, I don't care
about the third one,

115
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,860
Sometimes when you've been drinking
you're the most truthful.

116
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:50,445
Okay, look, I know Carla's gonna have
her little pre-wedding panic attack, 

117
00:06:50,446 --> 00:06:54,846
and what if she has her good ol' buddy Dr. Cox
there to tell her what a jackass I am, huh?

118
00:06:55,092 --> 00:06:56,454
Then what?

119
00:06:56,748 --> 00:06:59,554
You know what?
I'm glad he was drunk.

120
00:07:00,822 --> 00:07:02,466
Thank you.

121
00:07:07,585 --> 00:07:09,522
How was the liquor store, big guy?

122
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:11,166
What're you talking about?

123
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,632
Your six-pack.
Much love!

124
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:19,314
I don't know what you're talking
about, there, butch.

125
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,227
I don't know if you're sucking up
to me or making a pass at me...

126
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,102
But I say you skip it and we continue
in our state of mutual disdain.

127
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:29,355
Dr. Cox, you got it all wrong, man!

128
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:33,370
I don't disdain you! It's quite
the opposite, I "dain" you.

129
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:37,715
Yeah. I think if you get to know me better,
you just might "dain" me, too.

130
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,159
Here that's interesting.

131
00:07:39,184 --> 00:07:43,081
Of course, it's gibberish, but it's--it's interesting
nonetheless. I'm gonna go ahead and...

132
00:07:43,104 --> 00:07:45,053
Pass, and here's why:

133
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:49,386
You're a typical surgeon, and as a rule you guys
are insensitive and egotistical and you...

134
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:51,605
Have the sense of humor of
about a fourth grader.

135
00:07:51,628 --> 00:07:53,178
That's just not true.

136
00:07:53,202 --> 00:07:55,644
Who wants to touch my giant balls?

137
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,567
Well, your kidneys healed up
enough to release you,

138
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:11,368
but no sparring in karate
class for two months.

139
00:08:11,473 --> 00:08:14,009
Two months!?
That's a real punch in the crotch!

140
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:17,860
Randall, could you stop using that expression?
Because I can't get it out of my head.

141
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:20,854
Ladies, explain to me why...

142
00:08:20,878 --> 00:08:24,541
You are so concerned with my policy on
patients having sex in the hospital.

143
00:08:24,553 --> 00:08:25,456
- No reason!
- Just curious!

144
00:08:25,457 --> 00:08:27,653
- Trying to learn.
- I love you...sir.

145
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:30,670
Well, why don't we make it the same
as my sex policy with my wife:

146
00:08:30,706 --> 00:08:33,394
Absolutely not!
Now make me a sandwich.

147
00:08:37,492 --> 00:08:39,171
So, you and Jordan had a kid.

148
00:08:39,195 --> 00:08:40,886
Parenthood's pretty amazing.

149
00:08:41,473 --> 00:08:44,064
Tell you what, you're all set. Some peon
from surgery's gonna come down here...

150
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,065
and do your pre-op and then
you're good to go.

151
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:50,197
Room service.
Who ordered the liver?

152
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:52,111
- Jackass!

153
00:08:50,924 --> 00:08:52,111
- Bite me.

154
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:53,715
Great guy!

155
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:59,147
Hey, Laverne, my girlfriend's coming by, would
you mind giving her the keys to my apartment?

156
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:02,278
You know, I shacked up with a
man before I was married, too.

157
00:09:02,729 --> 00:09:04,430
His name was Jesus.

158
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:07,439
Our generation has the exact same
morals and values as yours.

159
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:09,883
Come on, Elliot!
Let's go find ourselves a man-whore!

160
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:11,350
See ya.

161
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:14,716
You know, but she's not moving in permanently.
She's just crashing for a while.

162
00:09:14,744 --> 00:09:18,035
- Mm-hmm.
- About a year ago, Jordan said she wanted to...

163
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:21,718
"crash for a while."
Now my office is a nursery,

164
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:26,580
Ly closet is my office, my clothes are in the
entertainment center, and my TV is in the john...

165
00:09:26,621 --> 00:09:30,013
Which I guess is kind of nice...
I don't even know anymore.

166
00:09:30,313 --> 00:09:33,065
Same thing happened to me.
After my divorce,

167
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:36,539
I told Mariana I was going to crash
at her place for a few weeks,

168
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,940
and we've been sharing
a bed for eight years.

169
00:09:39,334 --> 00:09:40,969
Isn't Mariana your mother?

170
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:43,557
Hey, who are we talking about
here, you or me?

171
00:09:43,585 --> 00:09:45,085
Lookit, here's the rule,
there, porn-star:

172
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:49,186
The moment her toothbrush hits your sink,
you've got yourself a permanent roomie.

173
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:54,336
How long will you be staying?

174
00:09:54,499 --> 00:09:56,489
For a while.

175
00:09:57,236 --> 00:09:59,977
Mmmmm, downy soft.

176
00:10:04,746 --> 00:10:06,776
There'll be toilet paper everywhere!

177
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,713
- Gotta go.
- Hey, uh...

178
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,711
Real sorry about the whole
mom situation, there.

179
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:17,649
- She has cold toes.
- Aw, Ted, don't be that guy!

180
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:19,638
What guy?

181
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,894
What guyyyy?

182
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,102
This is so exciting!

183
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:26,884
The closest I've ever come to breaking
the law was in sixth grade,

184
00:10:26,885 --> 00:10:29,585
when Alex Peterson sold his mom's
Virginia Slims out of his guest house.

185
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:32,473
- Wow! Was he a Blood or a Crip?
- He was Lutheran.

186
00:10:32,868 --> 00:10:35,375
This is it! This is it!
Stop the car! Stop the car.

187
00:10:35,403 --> 00:10:37,555
Keep the meter running,
we'll be right back.

188
00:10:39,463 --> 00:10:41,248
Ohh! What a rush!

189
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:44,725
I mean, I have never slept with a prostitute
before, but if it is half as much fun as buying one,

190
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:47,161
- Sign me up!
- Hey!

191
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,628
Quiet down back there!

192
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:51,658
Sorry. Heh...

193
00:10:52,394 --> 00:10:55,317
Now, even though I won't be
performing the transplant,

194
00:10:55,318 --> 00:10:57,518
I am a key member of the surgical team.

195
00:10:57,544 --> 00:11:01,468
It's too complicated to explain what
it is I do, but in layman's terms I...

196
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,329
I guess you'd call it "watching."

197
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:06,945
- Could you excuse me one second?
- Sure.

198
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:13,200
I taught him that!

199
00:11:13,227 --> 00:11:16,125
- Well struck, Barry.
- Huh... Heh...

200
00:11:16,144 --> 00:11:18,133
Let's, let's finish up here, okay?

201
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,231
- Have you, uh, been smoking?
- No, sir.

202
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,065
- Drinking?
- Nope! Oh...

203
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:26,525
I had a couple of glasses of champagne
at my daughter's wedding last month.

204
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:30,123
- But a little champagne's no big deal, huh?
- Naaahhhh...

205
00:11:37,644 --> 00:11:40,505
Look. Barry... Barry's a...
he's a great guy.

206
00:11:40,546 --> 00:11:44,729
Yeah. I totally forgot the rule to the
transplant list is no drinking...

207
00:11:44,756 --> 00:11:47,617
- Unless Cox says you're a great guy.
- Come on, pally...

208
00:11:47,658 --> 00:11:51,501
Guy's been on the transplant list for three
stinkin' years, this is a no-brainer.

209
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,204
You're right.

210
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:55,738
He's out.

211
00:12:08,997 --> 00:12:12,825
See, this is why you shouldn't get emotionally
invested in your patients.

212
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:17,881
Now when the dark prince does
finally call you home, please...

213
00:12:17,908 --> 00:12:21,492
Promise me that you'll donate your
body to science. And I don't...

214
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:24,394
mean medical science,
I mean NASA.

215
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:28,100
Because when those buzz-cuts have all
but given up on trying to figure out...

216
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:29,745
Just exactly what a black hole is,

217
00:12:29,746 --> 00:12:33,346
and they get one look at that space where
your heart was supposed to be...

218
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:37,147
well by-gum, you know they're just
gonna say: "Awwww, shucks!"

219
00:12:37,182 --> 00:12:39,061
"That's what it is!"

220
00:12:39,084 --> 00:12:42,336
Hey, champ! What has two thumbs
and doesn't give a crap?

221
00:12:43,123 --> 00:12:45,307
Bob Kelso.
How ya doin'.

222
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,361
"All right, you're just gonna have
to tell her she can't move in."

223
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:56,920
"It's no big deal, it's not like she
has the keys yet."

224
00:13:02,538 --> 00:13:05,015
"God, I'm horrible at giving bad news!"

225
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,715
"Wait a sec, I'm a doctor,
I give bad news all the time."

226
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:10,228
"Just like I did with Mr. Clark this morning."

227
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:12,600
"Who does his daughter
always remind me of?"

228
00:13:12,623 --> 00:13:14,220
"Molly Ringwald! Heh."

229
00:13:14,244 --> 00:13:17,778
"Man, she was good in 'The Breakfast Club'.
 I should rent that again."

230
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:20,337
"Come on! Focus!
You have to tell her!"

231
00:13:20,372 --> 00:13:23,331
"God, I need something to get me out of it!
Anything!"

232
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:25,409
Hello...

233
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:27,828
Yes, this IS J.D.!

234
00:13:27,852 --> 00:13:30,576
I'd LOVE to pick you up at jail!

235
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:36,036
- Slim, what are you in for?
- Robbery.

236
00:13:36,552 --> 00:13:40,134
- Prostitution!
- Would you please stop enjoying this so much?

237
00:13:40,873 --> 00:13:43,762
Photo-op!
Slammer!

238
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:45,987
You need to get your arm off me before...

239
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:48,635
- I throw that phone of yours up in the street.
- Why you gotta be playa-hatin'?

240
00:13:48,658 --> 00:13:50,419
Konnichiwa!

241
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,263
So who wants to tell me what happened?

242
00:13:52,286 --> 00:13:55,339
Lucy?
Ethel?

243
00:13:59,484 --> 00:14:02,184
Ohhh, hey Dr. Turk, you old...

244
00:14:02,219 --> 00:14:04,333
Turtle-headed pain in the ass. Aw!

245
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:07,075
Dammit all, Perry, that is SO not what
you came down here to say!

246
00:14:07,076 --> 00:14:09,276
Now you're BETTER than that!
Turn the car around!

247
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:11,542
Oh, so the worm has turned, huh?

248
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:16,062
Don't bother. That's what's wrong
with you medical guys...

249
00:14:16,332 --> 00:14:18,446
You...

250
00:14:18,469 --> 00:14:21,968
Never...
Know...

251
00:14:21,992 --> 00:14:25,702
When... To...
Face reality and realize that things...

252
00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:28,508
Are never gonna change between us!

253
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:32,829
Hell yeah!

254
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,866
Mm, it's so nice to have real food again.

255
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,367
Elliot, they didn't even feed us.

256
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,869
I love how much you guys
care about your patients.

257
00:14:42,893 --> 00:14:45,182
Wow, Danni is so sweet.

258
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,977
- What am I worried about?
- You know, Jordan and I are from around here...

259
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,720
And our friend Chuck's a stripper?
I'm sure he knows tons of guys...

260
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:52,721
that would love to have
sex with your patient.

261
00:14:52,755 --> 00:14:55,843
"What the hell!? What's it gonna be
like when she's at my place!?"

262
00:15:06,998 --> 00:15:10,450
Danni! Can you have the guys practice
in the other room, please?

263
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,244
Stop being such a fuddy-duddy!

264
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,673
Now, who haven't I slept with yet?

265
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,025
There'll be banana hammocks everywhere!

266
00:15:25,397 --> 00:15:27,475
Let's roll.

267
00:15:30,058 --> 00:15:32,043
Excellent work, everyone.

268
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,870
Nurse, I know you're new here,
so I wanted to offer you...

269
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:36,471
the chance to assist me in a bypass later.

270
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:40,192
And by that I mean we'd bypass the
kissing and go straight to the...

271
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:43,210
Oh, my God, you're a dude?

272
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:44,521
Sorry, Larry.

273
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:46,080
Aw, I feel so bad.

274
00:15:46,118 --> 00:15:49,476
Look, I'll make it up to him.
I will hook him up with...

275
00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:51,766
that chick!

276
00:15:51,895 --> 00:15:53,938
- Dude, that's Larry again.
- Ohhh!

277
00:15:53,962 --> 00:15:58,012
Oh, hello, and welcome to McSurgeon's.
May I take your order?

278
00:15:58,036 --> 00:16:01,629
"Yeah, I was thinking about getting
a simple operation..."

279
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,330
"with no unexpected complications, please?"

280
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:07,817
Oh, gosh, here I'm sorry, we're
fresh out of those. But...

281
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:11,618
If you have a child, maybe you'd like
to try one of our Infection Meals!

282
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:14,577
That'll be seven thousand dollars
please pay at the second window.

283
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:19,289
- You know, I'm really getting sick of this...
- Oh! I'm sorry! Are you talking?

284
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:21,696
Because I've decided to keep
my finger on the button,

285
00:16:21,697 --> 00:16:24,597
so I actually can't hear anything
that's going on in there.

286
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,174
But, for fairness' sake, I've decided to do
your end of the conversation.

287
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:29,975
 It goes a little something like this:

288
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:35,845
"Blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, cool
hip-hop lingo, blah-blah, blah-blah-blah."

289
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,744
Anyway, I've come up with a whole
new plan about Mr. Iverson.

290
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:41,357
If you wanna take that liver away from him...

291
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:44,958
just because you and I are having
some kind of personal beef...

292
00:16:45,251 --> 00:16:48,163
Then you go and tell the man yourself.

293
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,388
Don't worry, sweetheart, this'll
all be over in a second.

294
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:55,854
Please stop.

295
00:16:56,324 --> 00:16:58,061
Oh! It's the hips that fool me.

296
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:04,766
Hmm! Can't believe Chuck gave up stripping
to become a city councilman!

297
00:17:04,895 --> 00:17:07,443
- Same job, different outfit.
- Pff! True dat!

298
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,508
Elliot! You ain't as ghetto as
ya think y'are, 'kay?

299
00:17:10,778 --> 00:17:12,739
Let's go see how Maggie's doing.

300
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,648
Can I help you?

301
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:26,951
No.

302
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:29,170
He told me to say hi.

303
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:32,000
That's Stephanie,
our new transplant patient.

304
00:17:32,023 --> 00:17:35,675
Oh. And you picked her, so I'm
quite sure she is so very nice.

305
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,481
No, actually she's alienated every
member of my surgical team.

306
00:17:38,505 --> 00:17:41,358
Sweetheart, you're not
even ON the surgical team.

307
00:17:41,387 --> 00:17:43,371
I am a very important part of the team that...

308
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,391
I am a very important part of the team, thankyouverymuch.

309
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:48,156
I see, so what,
that's... that's it?

310
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:51,080
You say she gets the liver and
that's the way it goes?

311
00:17:51,162 --> 00:17:53,616
No, she gets the liver because
she followed the rules.

312
00:17:54,802 --> 00:17:57,311
Dr. Cox, I know it's really hard
on you medical guys,

313
00:17:57,312 --> 00:17:59,312
because you spend most of your
time with your patients...

314
00:17:59,322 --> 00:18:01,976
And you get emotionally attached.
But as a surgeon...

315
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:05,498
The person I'm closest to is the
guy who's giving us the liver...

316
00:18:05,545 --> 00:18:07,377
Because it's a gift...

317
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:12,648
And I think it's important that it goes to the person
that's proven they're up to the responsibility.

318
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,278
Holy cow, I get it.

319
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,543
I gotta collect myself for a moment, here.
That's very touching.

320
00:18:19,271 --> 00:18:21,431
You know I'm right.

321
00:18:21,818 --> 00:18:24,601
"Sometimes we forget that rules
are there for a reason."

322
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,441
"Other times, well..."

323
00:18:28,947 --> 00:18:30,802
- Uh, she's sleeping, sir.
- So?

324
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:32,979
You know, there's cupcakes down in Pediatrics!

325
00:18:38,128 --> 00:18:40,594
"Other times, rules are meant to be broken."

326
00:18:41,826 --> 00:18:46,652
- You are so beautiful.
- That was worth the wait!

327
00:18:46,675 --> 00:18:48,918
You are a stallion!

00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:57,791
"And once in a while, you have to throw
all the rules out the window..."

329
00:18:57,792 --> 00:19:00,092
"and know that everything's gonna be okay."

330
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,973
I feel really good about this!

331
00:19:04,135 --> 00:19:05,908
Me too!

332
00:19:06,918 --> 00:19:08,445
"Or not."

333
00:19:10,311 --> 00:19:12,659
"Of course, some rules are just plain silly."

334
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:14,632
Ya got big plans for tonight?

335
00:19:15,523 --> 00:19:18,823
It's Turk's stupid rule,
I don't wanna talk about it.

336
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:22,933
Hey! You never told me what
you really think of Turk.

337
00:19:22,992 --> 00:19:25,258
He is a complete tool...

338
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:29,191
But I suppose you could do a lot worse.

339
00:19:30,588 --> 00:19:32,191
Thanks...

340
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:36,588
Bye.

341
00:19:39,689 --> 00:19:44,589
