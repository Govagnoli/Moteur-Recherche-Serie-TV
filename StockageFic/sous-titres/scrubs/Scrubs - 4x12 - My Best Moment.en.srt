1
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,660
All the way from the parking lot! I told you I could do it!

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,470
Who's the idiot now!

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,530
Despite my burning thighs, giving Turk that piggyback ride was worth it.

4
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,530
Because I'm sure it put him in a great mood.

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,890
I'm in the worst mood.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,120
Why did I do it!?

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,460
Kelso's got this new stupid outreach program where families are allowed to observe surgeries.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,950
Yesterday I had to do a bypass on this guy.

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,500
You should have seen the family, standing there motionless, silently judging me.

10
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,620
And today I gotta do a colectomy on that guy.

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,700
What do you think his family is gonna be like?

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,980
There's a tumor in there! There's a tumor in there!

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,800
Ohh, don't go behind the kidney, brotha!

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,140
You didn't go to the black family yelling at the movie screen stereotype, did you?

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,510
Like a bear to honey.

16
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,250
Oh my God, I was supposed to be downstairs ten minutes ago...

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,630
to talk to a bunch of pre-med students about what it's like to be a doctor.

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,630
Oh, don't worry. I gotcha.

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,080
Buckle up, buddy!

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,940
Hell yeah!

21
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,030
Hey, kids, I'm Dr. Dorian. I'm sure you have lots of questions, so let's get started.

22
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,810
So, basically it's a topical application consisting of equal parts triethanolamine and phenyl dimethicone.

23
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,160
I suggest applying it twice a day for extra hold.

24
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,640
Okay? Here's a sample tube, Reuben. Excellent query.

25
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,350
Okay, then, anybody else?

26
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,920
Reuben again?

27
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,800
What was your best moment in medicine?

28
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,080
I-I'd say my best moment was probably my second year, New Year's Eve.

29
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,580
A young pregnant woman could barely make it into the hospital, she had her baby right there on the ramp.

30
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,240
You know, that's my first grandchild.

31
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,400
Did you deliver?

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
No, I didn't. But I did watch.

33
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,980
And I am a doctor. And you look amazing.

34
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,430
So even though Dr. Mickhead actually delivered the kid,

35
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,380
yours truly rang in the new year with grandma!

36
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,590
We had sex.

37
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,940
That's how I do it.

38
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,730
That was your best moment?

39
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,480
I totally get it. Older ladies know how to work it!

40
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,960
Okay, see, now you're in a bit of a pickle because the older lady you're talking about...

41
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,560
better not be me, and it sure as hell better not be somebody else.

42
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,760
So whatta you have to say?

43
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,940
Your favorite jeans are too tight and they look ridiculous!

44
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,170
What!?

45
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,250
Well, I... I'm in trouble anyway and it needed to be said!

46
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,990
Well, unfortunately for you that's just not true! Right?

47
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,810
Heh!

48
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,010
Wow.

49
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,880
I'll tell you what my best moment in medicine was.

50
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,610
Dammit, we lost him. Call it.

51
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,330
I'm not giving up on this guy! Prop his hand up.

52
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,020
What?

53
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,400
I said prop his hand up!

54
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,300
That's right: The Miracle Five.

55
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,510
You take this one, Perry.

56
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,480
Great moment, there, dumb-ass.

57
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,370
It starts out with a profound misunderstanding of how the human body works,

58
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,520
and winds up with you shattering some old man's hand.

59
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,390
Oh, yeah.

60
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,920
You know what'd be really neat?

61
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,950
If you guys all took a second and thought about what your best moment in medicine was.

62
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,500
It woulda been neat.

63
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,540
Scrubs épisode 4x12 :  \N My Best Moment

65
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,590
There's nothing sadder than a young guy checking into the hospital during the holidays.

66
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,590
I think I'll tell Elliot that.

67
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,800
There's nothing sadder than a young guy checking into the hospital on the holidays.

68
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,230
Hi. That's my dad.

69
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,700
Except that.

70
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,740
And that.

71
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,250
Just been so tired lately.

72
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,390
Yesterday, when the little man and I were wrestling, he... he dropped me in ten seconds.

73
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,870
I got him with a power kick.

74
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,390
Hey! You brought Tyler a new ice cream cone!

75
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,250
Sure....

76
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,530
Thanks.

77
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,390
It's a waffle cone.

78
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,540
So, Mr. Milligan, it turns out you have a pretty serious case of mono.

79
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,540
Don't you get that from kissing?

80
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,260
There are other ways you can get it.

81
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,190
Dr. Cox.

82
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,600
Hold that thought, Newbie. One, two, three, four.

83
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,970
My new thing is to count just exactly how many people in any given room can kick your ass.

84
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,770
And in here, the number is four.

85
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,770
Five if you count Mrs. Cross.

86
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,030
The other day, she went off her meds, sa-lammed him with a cafeteria tray!

87
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,230
She came out of nowhere!

88
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,740
Am I gonna get out of here in time for Christmas?

89
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,750
Tyler's mom isn't around anymore, and I'd really hate to ship him off to his grandparents'.

90
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,330
You'll beat Santa home. I promise.

91
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,900
Phyllis. Outside.

92
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,640
What the hell was that in there?

93
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,680
That's one more point for Mrs. Cross.

94
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,450
But let's see how she enjoys her beloved hard candy without...

95
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,290
her choppers!

96
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,720
Newbie! You never promise a patient that they're gonna be fine!

97
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,620
Mr. Milligan? His blood pressure's a little low; he just has mono.

98
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,850
Oh, for God's sakes, Newbie, take a look around, would you please?

99
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:08,120
What's the difference between your Mr. Milligan and every other patient in this I.C.U.?

100
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,600
And if the answer to that question is that he's the only one young enough...

101
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,340
to have never made a phone call like this:

102
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,050
"Brring! Hello? Operator? Give me.....

103
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,030
" then you'd be right. But since I'm not in the mood to make some big, dramatic, sweeping statement,

104
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,310
I'll just tell you this:

105
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,840
God hates doctors, He truly does.

106
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,850
You see all these old people in here?

107
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,360
Well, any of'em would give just about anything to be able to sashay off this planet,

108
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,970
but most of'em are gonna stay and they're gonna live forever and ever and ever.

109
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:39,000
And your Mr. Milligan, well, it turns out he's just young enough to die.

110
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:44,550
I mean, think about it: It's the holidays, there's a sweet little kid involved.

111
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,080
Can't you just feel it?

112
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,330
I did feel it. And I knew what Carla was gonna say before she said it.

113
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,850
Mr. Milligan is unconscious.

114
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,880
Newbie, let's go.

115
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,500
"Think of your best moment in medicine...."

116
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,810
You know, thanks for taking care of me, ma'am.

117
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,480
If there is ever any way that I can hook you up, you just call me at work.

118
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,480
Don't worry about it. So, what do you do?

119
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,520
Ahh, I raise and breed ponies.

120
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,470
Ponies!

121
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,920
Come on, Thunder!

122
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,150
Can't be late for rounds again, let's go. Giddyup!

123
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,680
Hey, Elliot? Would you keep an eye on Tyler, here, while we take care of his dad?

124
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,620
Hi!

125
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,200
Yeah, I'm not that great with kids. They've got such tiny hands. It's creepy.

126
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,640
I'm leaving now.

127
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,120
My dad's in the I.C.U. What does that mean?

128
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,350
Well, uh, Tyler, that stands for "Intensive Care Unit."

129
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,930
It's where we put our patients who need extra care, like somebody who might need help breathing...

130
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,460
because their lung collapsed, or maybe they had a brain aneurysm,

131
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,210
which is basically when a vessel ruptures and then blood pours into the...

132
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,340
You know what, forget it. You wanna see someone who's worse off than your dad?

133
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,020
We call him The Head in the Bed!

134
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,280
Okay.

135
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,340
Damn, his cultures are back, he's not septic.

136
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,580
Well, I'd start him on Dopamine.

137
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,870
- Already done. \N - Well, I'd scan his head.

138
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,760
I already ordered it.

139
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,390
Well, I'd definitely give Mrs. Cross her teeth back.

140
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,550
That I will not do!

141
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,740
Hey, J.D. Turns out Mr. Milligan doesn't have insurance.

142
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,590
Dr. Kelso said once he's stable we have to bounce him to County.

143
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:34,960
Sorry.

144
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,850
Turk! Hey! If you go talk to Kelso for me, I'll give you this special Christmas gum.

145
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,590
Okay, this is actually Mrs. Cross's medicated denture gum?

146
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,240
So you have to sell it with your eyes.

147
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,120
Sell it.... Sell it...!

148
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,430
Okay.

149
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,540
"Think of your best moment in medicine...."

150
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,430
I said, "I can't do it on my own!"

151
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:06,230
Excuse me, sir! A-a man just fainted over there! Are you a doctor?

152
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,720
Not this weekend, son.

153
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,780
Another Bahama mama, please...  easy on the Bahama, heavy on the mama!

154
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,410
How you doin'?

155
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Dr. Kelso, I know you told Carla to bounce Mr. Milligan to County, but it's Christmas! So...

156
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,330
what do you say?

157
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,330
I'd say get me a 3T form!

158
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,540
3T f...? What's that?

159
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,330
That's Tough Titties, Turkleton!

160
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh, God.

161
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,270
So, uh...what do you want to be when you grow up?

162
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,180
A baseball player.

163
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,850
Yeah, well, I wanted to be a ballerina when I was little. But, according to my mom,

164
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,210
six-year-olds with mild scoliosis and giant man-feet aren't dancer material.

165
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,010
But the joke's on her, because I am currently waiting to hear if the Saint Martha's Community Theatre...

166
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,840
will let me work lights for their production of The Nutcracker.

167
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,270
Can I have some chocolate milk?

168
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,570
Here's a buck. There's a vending machine right outside that door.

169
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,150
Dr. Reid. Would you sign this for me, please?

170
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,250
Sure!

171
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,220
So...what are you doing this weekend, Laverne?

172
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,040
Minding my own business. How'bout you?

173
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,400
Hopefully lighting the crap out of Saint Martha's auditorium!

174
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,810
Yippee.

175
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,820
"Think of your best moment in medicine..."

176
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,420
Dammit!

177
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,180
Little club soda will take that right out.

178
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,460
Thanks, Carla!

179
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,990
You're welcome, doctor.

180
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,600
Carla? What's goin' on up there?

181
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,720
I'm sorry, I was just thinking about the last time a doctor actually listened to me.

182
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,800
Sometimes I feel like...

183
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,850
Did you get the results of the scan?

184
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,780
They came back negative. I feel like we're missing something in his patient history.

185
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,860
When he came in, Mr. Milligan said that he and his son had been wrestling and goofing around.

186
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,450
Oh my God, he just might have goof-arounditis.

187
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,300
We should also check him for the silly-willies.

188
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,090
It's okay, they're just stressed out.

189
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,490
Any time a doctor disrespects me, I respond with a little note.

190
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,240
Wah. Worth it!

191
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,990
Are you swanning this guy?

192
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,480
Look, I really don't need you checking up on me every five seconds, okay?

193
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,430
I'm a doctor, and I have as much medical expertise as anyone in this place.

194
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,720
Now what exactly is swanning?

195
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,350
What?!

196
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:57,390
I'm kidding. Enough of the backseat doctoring...  I got this.

197
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,680
Why does it seem like every time I take a stand, everything turns to crap?

198
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,650
I gave that kid some money and sent him outside the hospital, and now I can't find him.

199
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,820
I'm sorry, what?

200
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,030
Kelso said, no insurance, you gotta stabilize the guy and then bounce him.

201
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,130
You gotta be kidding me.

202
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,700
I'll tell you what, in about ten more minutes none of this is gonna matter,

203
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,210
because this guy's circling the drain.

204
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,550
Why are you sick?

205
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,610
I can't figure this out. Maybe if we tried stress-dosed steroids?

206
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,230
I think I'll tell Dr. Cox that.

207
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,220
I can't figure this out. Maybe if we tried stress-dosed steroids?

208
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,250
Or maybe we could just fill a syringe with false promises and inject him with that.

209
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,180
Says here you already got that one covered!

210
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,910
You know, try and discourage me all you want, because kites fly highest against the wind.

211
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:40,570
What?

212
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,770
I'm a kite! I'm a big, beautiful kite!

213
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,820
Fly! You know what?

214
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,160
I wonder if Mr. Milligan could receive any blunt trauma without realizing it?

215
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,210
Wrestling.

216
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,450
Remember? He said his kid dropped him with a power kick.

217
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,230
Kids can kick pretty hard. Maybe he ruptured his spleen?

218
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,000
Get a stat abdominal CT.

219
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,400
Great catch there, Carla.

220
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,040
Thank you.

221
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,690
"Think of your best moment in medicine...."

222
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,620
You can do this, Dr. Turk.

223
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,040
Okay!

224
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,710
Time!

225
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:21,280
Well, it's official. Dr. Turk is now the fastest appendectomy in the hospital.

226
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,520
In your face, Dr. Beardface!

227
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,260
It's Beardfacé!

228
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,790
What the hell are you doing?

229
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,580
I got gummed.

230
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:37,290
Come on, it turns out Mr. Milligan has a ruptured spleen. We're prepping him for surgery in room C.

231
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,050
That's the room where the family gets to observe.

232
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:40,750
So?

233
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,620
Dude, you don't understand. When I operate, I don't see a person,

234
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,380
I see a machine with parts that need to be replaced and circuits that need to be rewired.

235
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,140
So you think you're a robot mechanic?

236
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,950
As a surgeon, the more detached I am, the more focused I am.

237
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,220
And it's pretty impossible to feel focused or detached...

238
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,660
when this guy's family's watching every move I make.

239
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,610
Well, I wouldn't worry about that. Mr. Milligan only has a son and Elliot lost him.

240
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,820
Awesome!

241
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:06,680
For me.

242
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,740
For me.

243
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,720
Is that fun?

244
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,330
No, son. It's work. But this body didn't happen by accident.

245
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,740
Well, you know what I think is fun? Baseball.

246
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,470
My son is a big baseball fan.

247
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,750
Not so much playing it, but more the...

248
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,000
designing and sewing of uniforms.

249
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,610
That's neat.

250
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,350
No, it's not.

251
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,630
Maybe we can play catch sometime.

252
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,170
I hope so, young man.

253
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,360
Oh! Thank God, Tyler, there you are!

254
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,110
Sorry, Dr. Kelso, this is Mr. Milligan's son.

255
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,710
Come on, Tyler. Thought you were gonna get some Yoo-Hoo and then come right back?

256
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,480
Mabel, this is Bob Kelso.

257
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:02,720
Uh, what's say we juggle some things and see if we can't free-ride Mr. Milligan financially for a while, okay?

258
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,650
Yes, this is really Bob Kelso!

259
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,510
Don't run off on me again, Tyler.

260
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,280
Sorry. I got scared. And when I get scared I hide.

261
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,280
I know it's stupid....

262
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,810
It's not stupid!

263
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,970
Wanna know where I used to hide when I used to get scared?

264
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,810
This closet right here.

265
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,100
And the one on the second floor.

266
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,580
Oh, and there's also this broken MRI machine down in the basement.

267
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,980
It's like my own private cocoon....

268
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,810
You really got scared?

269
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,530
Yeah. Everybody does here at first. Check this out.

270
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:37,720
Cool.

271
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,800
Hang in there, Steve.

272
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,330
In med school, they never teach you how to deal with death...

273
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,650
Steve'll be stronger if he gets through this on his own.

274
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,870
So, how did you stop being scared?

275
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,200
I just realized that people here need me to be brave.

276
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,340
Just like your dad needs you to be brave for his operation.

277
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,880
Can I hold his hand?

278
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,970
They're not actually very big on that.

279
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,100
Can I at least watch?

280
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,100
Are you sure?

281
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,330
Get it together, Steve!

282
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,420
I'm trying!

283
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,420
All right, let's do this!

284
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,000
Come on!

285
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,640
"Think of your best moment in medicine...."

286
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,730
Come here. Here y'go.

287
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,690
Here y'go!

288
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,570
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

289
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,550
Let's see anybody else make that shot!

290
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:53,940
Huh? Who's your daddy? Who's your daddy! Who's your daddy?

291
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,270
Uh, Carla. Carla, have you, uh, have you seen Newbie?

292
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,940
Oh, he got off your leash?

293
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,750
Give me a break. The kid's like a....

294
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,230
he's like a....

295
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,240
Have you ever seen a drunk baby?

296
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,650
Eh, it's a long story involving my son, a rum cake, and a low counter.

297
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:17,950
Suffice to say that it turns out at first it's... it's endearing to watch them bounce off of the walls.

298
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:22,040
But, man, you take your eyes off'em for one second and...  BAM!

299
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,510
They got a bucket on their head and they're plowing right through your brand new flat screen TV.

300
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,510
God save me, it was barely out of the box.

301
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,120
The point is that Newbie is my drunk baby.

302
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,970
He figured out that spleen thing, maybe you should get off his case.

303
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,960
I would love to get off of his case.

304
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,280
In fact, nothing would make me happier than to watch him walk into a patient's room...

305
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,730
and not feel that I have to run in after him and check up on everything.

306
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,180
You wanna know what I think?

307
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,150
No.

308
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,320
I think you know how good a doctor J.D. is, and whether you admit it or not,

309
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,200
you have a great personal stake in his future.

310
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,220
So don't pretend for one second that all this attention you throw at him is just for him,

311
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,650
because it's also for you.

312
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,920
As your friend,

313
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,840
I'm telling you that if you want him to keep growing you oughtta back off of him once in a while.

314
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,520
Carla...

315
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,970
And don't say anything, because you know I'm right and my jeans do look good.

316
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,160
God, I hate Christmas.

317
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,140
I really do.

318
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,310
Uh, hey, Elliot? Can I talk to you in private?

319
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,110
Parlez-vous Français?

320
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,290
You know, I did learn a little when my high school class went to France,

321
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,920
but that was just stuff to pick up chicks.

322
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,430
Turk, je crois que Tyler se sentirais mieux s'il pouvait observer l'opération, d'accord?

323
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,910
J'ai... euh...

324
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,480
Tour... d'Eiffel...

325
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,480
pantalon.

326
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,630
What?

327
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,540
Pamplemousse!

328
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,810
Can I please stay?

329
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,590
Yeah, kid, you could stay.

330
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,800
Dr. Turk? Thanks.

331
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:17,190
None of us wanted to say what we were thinking: How vulnerable we felt.

332
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,640
So we all just stood around, pretending to work,

333
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,630
and waited for someone to come through that door and tell us how this was gonna end.

334
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,640
Who's the man!

335
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,930
All right, you guys, we still got a lot of work to do.

336
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,840
Turk, why don't you go check the post-op films in radiology; and Carla...

337
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,970
will transfuse back to a hemoglobin ten; and Elliot, why don't you take Tyler...

338
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,560
and go get us all ice cream immediately.

00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,850
I'm gonna go check on him. You wanna come?

340
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,680
No. No, you got it.

341
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,520
It's amazing how one patient can affect so many people.

342
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,220
Dr. Dorian? What was your best moment in medicine?

343
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,250
My best moment...? Well, there was this guy...

344
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,560
...he had the most amazing little kid...

345
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,420
...and the doctors actually listened to me...

346
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,320
...I knocked the surgery right out the park...

347
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,580
...and I decided to pull some strings for the guy...

348
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,290
...and honest to God, I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself,

349
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,970
but Newbie handled the whole thing...

350
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,670
wire to wire...

351
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,850
...and I kept my promise.

352
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,320
Because the two of them got home in time for Christmas.

353
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,240
And that was my best moment in medicine.
