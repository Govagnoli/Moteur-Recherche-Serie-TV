1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,245
Dammit! Brain Freeze is too hard.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,680
I knew I should've gone for Funny Bone.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,670
Step aside!

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,060
One thing I've learned is to never play Operation against a surgeon for money.

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,630
Eight seconds! Is that a new record, baby?

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,290
That depends, what are we talking about?

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,670
Ah-haa! Ha-haaa! Let's play again.

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:31,965
- No.
- Oh, come on,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,870
if you do, I promise that every time I hit the buzzer I'll act like I'm getting electrocuted, like this:

10
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,940
That's awesome, but no. My blood sugar's a little low.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,280
You want a cookie?

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,710
Turk's blood sugar was low because he has Type II diabetes

13
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:46,500
and hasn't figured out his medication yet.

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,040
Mulattos.

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,220
They're Milanos, you idiot.

16
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,740
I always thought that was a little bigoted for a cookie.

17
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,100
Cookie racism aside, I had bigger problems.

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,670
It had been three weeks since our dad died, and my brother Dan was still staying with me.

19
00:01:02,705 --> 00:01:05,980
Boy, nothing like a little time off to remind you how hard you been working, huh?

20
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,985
You bar tend three shifts a week.

21
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,120
Two. They dropped me one for doinking the Jell-o shot girl.

22
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,430
- Hey!
- Hey!

23
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,240
Sorry I'm late.

24
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,170
Since I had dumped Elliot and broke her heart, she couldn't really be there for me.

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,410
But thankfully she was there for my brother.

26
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,820
You doing okay?

27
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:21,700
I am now.

28
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,330
You know, without Elliot, I never woulda gotten through my dad's death.

29
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,405
Our dad's death.

30
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,280
Right. Air-hockey?

31
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,175
Oh, hellooo.

32
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,560
Women are checking me out lately.

33
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,700
Was it the ten push-ups I've been cranking out every other Sunday?

34
00:01:36,735 --> 00:01:37,410
Perhaps.

35
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,070
More likely it was the pledge I made not to date anyone until Elliot did.

36
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,130
See, since then, the gals have been all over me.

37
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,245
Can I buy you a drink?

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,940
I'm sorry, sugar, this store is closed.

39
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,490
They've been all over me.

40
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,460
Very impressive, but I'm sorry.

41
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,090
You have some... gum... on your shoe.

42
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,770
Dr. Clock, do you have a minute?

43
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,730
Sure. I was just talking to Dr. Bromberg about switching shifts...

44
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:13,315
so that I can go to Mexico for my mom's wedding. I am so psyched!

45
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,220
She is getting married to this guy that has been like a father to me since I was this big.

46
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,270
Actually, maybe I was this big... How tall was I in fourth grade?

47
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,470
It's a mystery!

48
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:28,530
Now, our old hospital psychiatrist used to write my wife, Enid, a prescription for crazy pills.

49
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:33,840
He was a dear, dear friend, but he died or moved or something and now I need you to do the honors.

50
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,900
Have her come in for a few sessions, I'll gladly prescribe antidepressants.

51
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:37,950
That's going to be a problem.

52
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,875
Why?

53
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,970
She doesn't know she's taking them.

54
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,865
The key to sleeping in the on-call room...

55
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,670
is to block out the noises around you like snoring, teeth-grinding, or even...

56
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,090
...on-call room nookie.

57
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,860
Hello, my old friend, how I've missed you.

58
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,550
That's feel good.

59
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,440
Yes, it does.

60
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,330
Time out, male moaning! Party's over!

61
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,640
Hey!

62
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,670
Hey, little brother.

63
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,420
Scrubs épisode 4x07:
My common enemy

65
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,715
You know, on'The Sopranos,'

66
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,380
if a guy caught his brother with his ex-girlfriend,

67
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,065
he'd just rub his ass out!

68
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,400
Oh, believe you me, the second I get Dan alone,

69
00:03:33,435 --> 00:03:35,290
there's gonna be some serious ass-rubbing.

70
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,860
I shouldn't smack-talk.

71
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,155
Hey, mind if I join you guys?

72
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,480
I think the question you should be asking is, "Mind if I diddle your ex?"

73
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,300
Oh, and just a great big congratulations on your on-going streak...

74
00:03:46,335 --> 00:03:47,960
of being the world's worst older brother!

75
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,460
Thanks, Coxy!

76
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,540
I knew it was my turn to let Dan have it, but for some reason I wasn't mad.

77
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,235
Listen, Dan...

78
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,120
J.D., let me explain.

79
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,895
I came to the hospital to see you,

80
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,370
and then I ran into Elliot and it just happened.

81
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:01,180
It was a one-time thing.

82
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,445
I'm okay with it.

83
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,270
Great,'cause it's been going on for a few weeks.

84
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,060
Elliot's amazing! Smart, funny... hhhot.

85
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,650
I was in a dark place and she saved me, she really did.

86
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,380
Haven't felt this good since my dad died.

87
00:04:12,415 --> 00:04:13,092
Our dad.

88
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:13,770
Right.

89
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,590
Hold up!

90
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,880
When Carla and I came home yesterday, we heard something.

91
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,980
Did you two hook up in J.D.'s room?

92
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,620
A friend wouldn't ask and a gentleman wouldn't tell.

93
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,400
Did you?

94
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,670
Twice! But we didn't go under the sheets out of respect.

95
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,590
How thoughtful!

96
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,240
I'm so sorry you lost your grandmother.

97
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,260
Our prayers go out to you and your family.

98
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,260
Thank you, Doctor. That's very kind.

99
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,030
That'll be seventeen hundred dollars.

100
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,190
Sir. Sir?

101
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,440
It is not your job to collect money from patients!

102
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,050
I know, but I just fired the woman who usually does it.

103
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,000
You fired Glenda? Why?

104
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,290
Oh, how precious!

105
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,870
Mind if I hold him?

106
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,010
Go right ahead.

107
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,720
I FINALLY GOT A BABY!

108
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,030
She was stealing from the hospital.

109
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,205
Oh, Dr. Clock. Uh, look,

110
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,080
I'm afraid I wasn't being honest with you before.

111
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,950
In my job, it seems like I'm always the bad guy.

112
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,210
Hard as this is to admit, it gets to me sometimes.

113
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,440
The point is, the antidepressants I asked you to prescribe weren't for my wife, they were for me.

114
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,630
Oh, I understand. So what dosage are you on?

115
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,620
Where are my Fig Newtons, Bob?!

116
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,440
I'm getting them, dear!

117
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,980
About half a Newton?

118
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,390
No dice.

119
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:35,775
Hey!

120
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,410
Boy, oh boy, does it look like you pissed off the wrong guy there, crunchy.

121
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,910
And trust me, he'll make you pay.

122
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,590
Oh, Dr. Kelso's all bluster. Underneath it all, I bet he's a sweetheart.

123
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,440
No, no. Underneath it all, he is pure evil.

124
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,290
Perry, no one's pure evil! I mean, yeah, some people have a hard outer shell,

125
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,570
but inside, everybody has a creamy center.

126
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,290
There are plenty of people here on this particular planet...

127
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,730
who are hard on the outside and hard on the inside.

128
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,130
So they'd have more of a nougaty center?

129
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,430
Lady, people aren't chocolates.

130
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,340
D'you know what they are mostly?

131
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:11,730
Bastards.

132
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,270
Bastard-coated bastards with bastard filling.

133
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,470
But I don't find them half as annoying as I find naive bobble-headed optimists...

134
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:20,420
who walk around vomiting sunshine.

135
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,270
I'm touching your creamy center!

136
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,615
Ohh, I am... so very angry...

137
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,890
that I'm going to find someone to kill...

138
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,410
just to prove her wrong.

139
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,110
Why you acting like that whole Dan and Elliot thing doesn't bother you?

140
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:43,080
Because it doesn't.

141
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,295
Dude, you're missing a great opportunity here, man.

142
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,360
If you act like it bothers you, Elliot'll feel guilty...

143
00:06:47,395 --> 00:06:48,880
and she'll finally forgive you for dumping her.

144
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,390
I'm telling you, you gotta use this like I use my diabetes.

145
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,690
Watch.

146
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,680
Honey? My blood sugar's dipping.

147
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:57,970
Don't move!

148
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,090
Thanks, sweetness!

149
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,015
Oh my God! This could be my diabetes!

150
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,790
Exactly. But you gotta use it before that window closes.

151
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,310
Lucky for me, my diabetes window stays open 24/7.

152
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,590
Unless, God forbid, they find a cure.

153
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,970
Amen, brother.

154
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,460
Bye, folks.

155
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,300
You'll notice I knocked a hundred dollars off the bill because of the...

156
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,980
you know, baby-stealing thing.

157
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:31,930
Turk was right.

158
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,970
Lying to Elliot was the perfect way to get our friendship back to normal.

159
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,040
Thanks for the loaner scooter, Johnny!

160
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,380
I wanna talk to you for a second!
Can you turn that thing off?

161
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,900
Sorry!

162
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,070
Sorry!

163
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,580
Sorry!

164
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,940
Look, when I caught you two yesterday, I didn't know what to say.

165
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:54,830
But now I do.

166
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,050
You really hurt me.

167
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,750
Okie-dokie.

168
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,390
GUYS! THERE ARE SICK PEOPLE TRYING TO SLEEP!

169
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,500
J.D., are you really this upset?

170
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,980
Well how would you feel if I hooked up with one of your siblings?

171
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,520
A little confused considering I have four brothers.

172
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,130
But not surprised.
At you or Barry.

173
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,220
Barry?

174
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,330
I guess I just didn't think I was doing anything wrong.

175
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,140
Well obviously you did, or you woulda told me about it from the beginning.

176
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,430
That one had to sting.

177
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,710
I really wanna look back and see if it landed,

178
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,660
but I'll have to go back to sad face first.

179
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,770
Oh, it landed!

180
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,410
Dr. Clock, may I have a word?

181
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,730
Uh-oh, it's payback time.

182
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,720
I got you a present for your trip to Mexico.

183
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,570
It's my old Spanish-to-English dictionary.

184
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,750
I don't need it anymore... I've mastered the language.

185
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,630
Gracias, Señor.

186
00:08:58,665 --> 00:09:00,100
You're welcome-o!

187
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,830
You were right... payback's a bitch.

188
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,490
Well, just get back to me when you have an answer.

189
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,180
Baby, check this out.

190
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,300
Dr. Kelso just offered me Glenda's old job as administrative supervisor.

191
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,640
Oh, that's great, sweetie.

192
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,070
The job pays an extra seven thousand dollars a year!

193
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,920
My baby's an administrative supervisor!

194
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,870
Let's celebrate! Whatever you want!

195
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,480
Ohh! Let's go shopping for a new duvet cover!

196
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,770
Oh, I'd love to! But my diabetes is acting up.

197
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,390
Bob. We have a problem.

198
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,725
Not now, Perry, I'm swamped.

199
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,790
I'm trying to find an exterminator to kill the bat in my attic.

200
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,360
Be a man, Bob! That's what tennis racquets are for!

201
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,420
Oh, good lord! He got Baxter!

202
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,600
Try telling that to my one-eared dog.

203
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,290
Bob, do you realize what you did by giving Blondie that book?

204
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,710
With any luck, I kept her from reporting me to the board for trying to con her out of meds.

205
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:01,395
Thanks to your little gesture,

206
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,510
she actually believes that the earth is full of people who, deep down,

207
00:10:05,545 --> 00:10:07,685
are filled with kindness and caring!

208
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,020
Well that's absurd. People are bastard-coated bastards with bastard filling.

209
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,180
Exactly!

210
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,740
Oh, sweet Moses.

211
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,270
Everything has gone straight down the crapper...

212
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:18,320
since Enid got off the antidepressants.

213
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,355
I didn't know Enid suffered from depression.

214
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,320
She doesn't. Those pills kill her sex drive.

215
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,260
Dude, your idea totally worked!

216
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,440
Incoming, man.

217
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,150
MY OWN BROTHER! WHY!?

218
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,520
Ohh, God, it hurts so bad!

219
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,035
You can stop now, she's gone.

220
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,450
No, I think I broke my hand.

221
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,990
There's nothing more satisfying than having a good plan.

222
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,390
- Goodnight, amigos.
- 'Night.

223
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,090
Sometimes a plan can crystallize in a moment.

224
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,145
What are we gonna do?

225
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,190
Let's destroy her.

226
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,540
And sometimes a plan can fall apart just as quickly.

227
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,310
Ehhh? So when do you start your new job?

228
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,380
I turned it down.

229
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,355
What?

230
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,190
I know it's a dream job, but with your diabetes I think you need me more.

231
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,400
Of course, in my plan nobody gets hurt.

232
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,690
Hey, little brother.

233
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,480
What are you doing back in the tub!?

234
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,140
Elliot dumped me.

235
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,360
...Except my brother.

236
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,220
She's gone! She's gone! Ohh, why?

237
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,950
Ohh, why. Better llllearn how to f-face it.

238
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:38,890
She's gone, she's gone! Ohhhhoh, why!

239
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,530
Ohhh, why! What went wrooooong!

240
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,530
Don't you think you're overreacting?

241
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,160
No, J.D., I don't, because Elliot was the best thing...

242
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:48,640
that ever happened to me and now she's gone.

243
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,960
Ahhhh... she's gone!

244
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,560
She's gone. She's... gone! She's gone... she's gone.

245
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,435
- That's not even the right gibberish!
- You know what, J.D.?

246
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,050
Elliot and I were supposed to have a big romantic evening together,

247
00:12:01,085 --> 00:12:02,440
and look at all this stuff I bought.

248
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,060
Candles. Champagne. A Dido CD.

249
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,180
I guess I'll just throw these things out with rest of the garbage.

250
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,460
Oh, come on, don't go.

251
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,990
We can watch'Kangaroo Jack' and chug a Foster's every time they say "g'day"!

252
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:18,990
G'day, J.D.

253
00:12:19,025 --> 00:12:19,690
Dan!

254
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,040
I said g'day!

255
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,810
Baby, you have to take this job.

256
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,440
Let it go. It's done!

257
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,065
You okay?

258
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,720
No. Sometimes I wish I'd never gotten this stupid diabetes!

259
00:12:32,755 --> 00:12:34,720
Hey! Let's not get crazy!

260
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,360
Dear God, she has an actual skip in her step.

261
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,400
Doesn't bother me as much as the whistling.

262
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,120
Watch what happens.

263
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,670
Why are you whistling, Ted?
Your life is pathetic.

264
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,790
Right.

265
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,770
Perry, what's our plan of attack?

266
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,425
When I crush a person's spirit,

267
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,180
I like to use a combination of intimidation and degradation.

268
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:19,895
I prefer to create an environment...

269
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,010
in which the subjects end up crushing themselves!

270
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,100
I like to pick one person and torment them relentlessly for no reason.

271
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,050
If I could find them I'd show ya.

272
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,390
He's near.

273
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,030
I'm not sure moon-beam is going to break so easily.

274
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,600
I just wish we knew something personal that would really get to her.

275
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,070
Turns out you can't go to your mom's wedding.

276
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:48,750
There's too much shift-switching going on here...

277
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:49,900
and I don't like shift-switching.

278
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,410
It's too hard to say!

279
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,630
That wasn't very soft and creamy.

280
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,480
It's okay.

281
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,750
He has a hospital to run, I understand.

282
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:16,110
Good God. She can't be stopped.

283
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,880
Let me get this straight:

284
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,860
You want me to offer your wife the same job she's already turned down.

285
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,480
Is that about the size of it, Turkleton?

286
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,460
Actually, sir, my last name isn't Turkleton, it's just Turk.

287
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,940
As in Chris Turk.

288
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,930
I prefer Turkleton.

289
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,890
Sir, I promise you, if you offer her the job again she'll say yes.

290
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,765
And I'll do anything... I'll pick up extra shifts,

291
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,310
I'll volunteer... I'll volunteer at the clinic... whatever you want!

292
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,830
I want you to kill the giant bat that's been living in my attic!

293
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,140
You keep Enid in the attic?

294
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,610
You make me laugh, Turkleton. 8 o'clock, sharp.

295
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,030
And wear goggles.

296
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,490
Yes!

297
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,360
I decided the only way Elliot would take Dan back is if she knew the truth...

298
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,990
that their being together didn't really bother me.

299
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,580
Elliot, we need to talk.

300
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,130
Nice jammies!

301
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,180
Thanks, they're new!

302
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,850
This'll only take a second.

303
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,790
Look, you know how I told you I was upset about you and Dan?

304
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,690
Is that champagne?

305
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,920
Yeah. Yeah, I was celebrating my... new jammies.

306
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,530
I love champagne. You mind if I have a little?

307
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,980
Thank you. A nipper!

308
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,200
Tingly! It's a tingly drink!

309
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,410
Oooooh! Pretty candles!

310
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,340
Anyhoo, I know you broke up with Dan because you thought I was upset,

311
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,390
but in reality, I... uh... I...

312
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:44,930
"I want to thank you! For giving me the best day of my life... "

313
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,370
I love this song, who is it?

314
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,210
Dido. And you've really got to meet my brother Barry.

315
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,490
Dido?

316
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,370
Look at all this stuff I bought. Candles.

317
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,120
Champagne.

318
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,300
A Dido CD.

319
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,990
Dan?

320
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,480
Hey, little brother!

321
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,830
Tingles.

322
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,050
Carla, we have to talk.

323
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,710
Is it your blood sugar again?
I'll get you something!

324
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,080
Baby, I feel fine.

325
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,530
It's just that I kinda been using my diabetes to get you to, you know,

326
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,850
hook me up with sandwiches and whatnot.

327
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,390
I can't believe you!

328
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,970
Oh, man! I brought that from home!

329
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,810
Look, baby, before you get freaked out, I fixed it already. Look!

330
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,130
Nurse Turkleton! I wanted to offer you that job once more!

331
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,150
I don't want it!

332
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,880
Great! See you Saturday, bat-man.

333
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,980
Baby, what the hell!

334
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,685
Maybe I decided right away that I didn't want that job...

335
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,860
because I'd miss working with patients but I didn't tell you...

336
00:16:50,895 --> 00:16:52,345
because you were excited about the money,

337
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,950
so I used your diabetes as an excuse. I don't know...

338
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,570
I don't really remember...

339
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,000
Tastes funny.

340
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,050
You see, Bob, it didn't even faze her.

341
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:11,985
Patience, Perry.

342
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,020
With a tough one like her, you have to wait for it.

343
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,070
Here it comes.

344
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,530
And we've broken her!

345
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,590
There sits a dejected a woman, all alone,

346
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,590
wounded, vulnerable...

347
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,520
Crying.

348
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,180
She's ruining it for me.

349
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,070
Lady, stop cryin'!

350
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,240
Dr. Clock, you don't have to miss your wedding.

351
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,240
I was lying about shift-switching.

352
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,740
I like doing it, I like saying it... shift-switching.

353
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,770
And I only lied because we were trying to destroy your morale.

354
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,050
Why would you do that?

355
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,610
Well, in our defense, you're overly cheery and we were bored.

356
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,120
But you thought it would be nice to come clean and make me feel better?

357
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,260
- Pretty much.
- Pretty much, yeah.

358
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,370
See, I told you there's good in everyone.

359
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,745
If you'll excuse me, boys, I've got a plane to catch.

360
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,520
Don't even pretend like you knew what we were doing all along.

361
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,620
Adios, boys.

362
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,850
Was she always wearing that big hat?

363
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,640
I can't believe you two never broke up.

364
00:18:15,675 --> 00:18:17,195
Dan was in my tub for four hours,

365
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,900
drinking beers and singing "She's Gone. "

366
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,180
How do you take a bath?

367
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,625
Okay, I'm gonna get dressed.

368
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,640
Hey, Elliot, do you mind if I borrow one of your socks?

369
00:18:24,675 --> 00:18:26,080
I seem to have lost my righty in the fray!

370
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,360
Oh! There you are, high-flyer!

371
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,860
J.D., Dan and I both know this is just a fling.

372
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,420
Still, I feel like the worst person in the whole world.

373
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,700
Please, can you forgive me?

374
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,930
Elliot, I came here to tell you I was never actually mad at you.

375
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,940
How could you not be mad that I was hooking up with your brother?

376
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,450
I don't know. I just... wasn't.

377
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,070
How could you hook up with my brother without considering my feelings?

378
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,880
I don't know I... I just didn't.

379
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,550
That's when I realized that Elliot and I had absolutely...

380
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:57,540
no romantic feeling for each other anymore.

381
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,290
No matter what the situation.

382
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,250
It was a little sad, but, who knows?

383
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,100
Maybe it meant we could be friends again.

384
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,920
Hey! I can't find my Dido CD!

385
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,240
If my heart could write songs, they'd sound like these.

386
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,340
I think relationships are inherently fragile.

387
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,380
They can be strengthened by a shared excuse.

388
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,980
Turk! We just got invited to Linda's Jack & Jill bridal shower.

389
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,250
Do you mind if I use your diabetes to get out of it?

390
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,650
Of course not, baby!

391
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,760
And now...

392
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,260
it's bat-killing time!

393
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,240
Good lord!

394
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,920
Others can be torn apart by the loss of a common enemy.

395
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,530
I hate you, Bob.

396
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,430
Same times a thousand, big guy.

397
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,880
Well, goodnight, little bro.

398
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,875
Oh, goodnight, Dan. Sleep tight.

399
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,910
There's a bus schedule underneath your pillow.

400
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,800
And for Elliot and I...

401
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,930
turns out all we needed was a little time.

402
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:20,970
'Night, J.D.

403
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,760
What was that for?

404
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,880
The good news was this Elliot and Dan thing...

405
00:20:30,915 --> 00:20:32,800
meant that I was back on the market!

406
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,130
Can I buy you a drink?

407
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,320
No thanks.

408
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,550
Yep! I'm back, baby!

409
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,690
More nuts, please.
