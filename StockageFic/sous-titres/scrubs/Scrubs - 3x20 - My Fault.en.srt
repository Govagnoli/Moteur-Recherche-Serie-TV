1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:04,707
<i>In some ways, Dr. Cox and Dr. Kelso are a lot like an old married couple.</i>

2
00:00:04,742 --> 00:00:07,354
I need your opinion about something.

3
00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:10,112
Yes, Bob, those pants do make you look like you're holding water.

4
00:00:10,147 --> 00:00:14,684
Perry, I'll tell you the same thing I told a 
comic I once saw at a strip club in Reno

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,081
I'm not here for the jokes.

6
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,669
Color me intrigued, Bob.

7
00:00:17,704 --> 00:00:21,417
I am considering offering full body scans here at Sacred Heart.

8
00:00:21,452 --> 00:00:22,249
What do you think?

9
00:00:22,284 --> 00:00:26,973
I think showing perfectly healthy people 
every harmless imperfection in their body

10
00:00:27,008 --> 00:00:33,207
just to scare them into taking invasive and 
often pointless tests is an unholy sin.

11
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:36,616
Does sound a little sketchy ethically, doesn't it? Thanks, Perry.

12
00:00:39,844 --> 00:00:43,207
Did that just happen? Anybody?

13
00:00:43,242 --> 00:00:45,739
<i>Me, I was stuck at a couples-only dinner party.</i>

14
00:00:45,774 --> 00:00:49,034
<i>There were the soon-to-be newlyweds....</i>

15
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:52,093
<i>There were the girl that I loved and 
the guy trying to eat her face....</i>

16
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:54,627
<i>And then there's Danni....</i>

17
00:00:54,662 --> 00:00:56,100
You know what I was thinking?

18
00:00:56,135 --> 00:00:57,726
Nobody cares, Danni.

19
00:00:57,761 --> 00:01:01,316
Aww, this has been fun, but I have 
to drive Turk back to the hospital.

20
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:03,129
Yeah, and I gotta get up early and look for an apartment.

21
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:06,492
Yeah, he wouldn't take this perfect one he saw 
today just 'cause the last tenant died there.

22
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:08,079
Elliot! Rats ate his tongue out!

23
00:01:08,114 --> 00:01:09,854
Yeah, but the kitchen was so cute!

24
00:01:09,889 --> 00:01:10,838
Oh, please.

25
00:01:10,873 --> 00:01:13,563
Hey, Turk! Where're you guys gonna live after you get married?

26
00:01:13,598 --> 00:01:14,920
You mean where you gonna live.

27
00:01:14,955 --> 00:01:15,901
Baby, not now. Don't know yet!

28
00:01:19,235 --> 00:01:20,860
Guess it's just the two of us.

29
00:01:22,806 --> 00:01:23,769
You wanna have sex?

30
00:01:23,804 --> 00:01:25,849
I guess.

31
00:01:27,405 --> 00:01:28,165
Do I have to look at you?

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,148
Please don't.

33
00:01:29,183 --> 00:01:30,129
Shut up.

34
00:01:33,337 --> 00:01:35,929
 I can't believe Kelso really asked my opinion. You know?

35
00:01:35,964 --> 00:01:40,577
Look, pal, if I wanted to sit and listen to someone yammer on about their lives,

36
00:01:40,612 --> 00:01:42,202
I'd be at my AA meeting right now.

37
00:01:42,237 --> 00:01:44,015
Listen, there, scrub-brush,

38
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,624
it just so happens it was the only empty seat in the whole joint.

39
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:48,777
And besides, as a fellow abusive drinker,

40
00:01:48,812 --> 00:01:52,555
you are honor bound by barstool protocol to 
listen to every last word out of my mouth.

41
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,943
Go.

42
00:01:54,978 --> 00:02:01,026
Kelso.... Kelso really listened to me about 
this whole full body scan thing.

43
00:02:01,061 --> 00:02:03,179
I was thinking about getting one of those scans.

44
00:02:03,214 --> 00:02:04,919
What did he say?

45
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:08,698
Mommy? When's daddy coming home?

46
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:15,725
He isn't. If only he'd loved us enough to get a full body scan at Sacred Heart!

47
00:02:18,237 --> 00:02:19,455
Holy cow!

48
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:23,435
Black label.

49
00:02:39,394 --> 00:02:42,897
Oh, my goodness! I totally kicked that hernia's ass!

50
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:45,098
Nicely done, as usual, Dr. Turk.

51
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:50,286
Dude. Why is Hot Doc being so nice to you lately?

52
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:52,025
I don't know, but it's about time.

53
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,782
I haven't had to work this hard to win 
someone over since Carla's mom.

54
00:02:54,817 --> 00:02:56,332
I thought Carla's mom hated you?

55
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:59,513
Yeah, but she died, so I'm counting it as a win.

56
00:02:59,548 --> 00:03:03,369
I bought a killer dress for your wedding yesterday. Ooh!

57
00:03:03,404 --> 00:03:05,674
Speaking of which, it's only two weeks away.

58
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:07,791
Has your bride-to-be started freaking out yet?

59
00:03:07,826 --> 00:03:10,323
No, Carla's not the "freak out" type.

60
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:15,158
<i>Turk didn't realize that everyone has 
their moments when emotions run high.</i>

61
00:03:16,745 --> 00:03:17,594
TURK!

62
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:20,541
KELSOOOOO!

63
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:22,241
Oh, Danni!

64
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:23,072
Turk!

65
00:03:23,107 --> 00:03:24,214
Kelso!

66
00:03:24,249 --> 00:03:25,883
Danni!

67
00:03:25,918 --> 00:03:26,861
Turk!

68
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:27,657
Carla!?

69
00:03:27,692 --> 00:03:28,561
Not here.

70
00:03:28,596 --> 00:03:29,960
Danni!

71
00:03:29,995 --> 00:03:33,247
I'm gonna go put some clothes on. After all, I am a lady.

72
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:35,778
Oh, by the way, I used your razor to shave my pits.

73
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:36,876
Keep it.

74
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,607
Dude, Danni did the weirdest thing last night

75
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:40,276
she called out her own name during sex.

76
00:03:40,311 --> 00:03:41,787
That is weird. Why are we whispering?

77
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,119
Because she hears like a bat.

78
00:03:43,154 --> 00:03:44,101
Bats hear really well?

79
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:45,272
Yeah, 'cause they can't see.

80
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:47,429
Oh, yeah, that's right, sonar. Wait a second, that's whales!

81
00:03:47,464 --> 00:03:49,807
No, no, no, no, no. Bats and whales, bats and whales!

82
00:03:49,842 --> 00:03:50,942
Okay, okay, okay.

83
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:52,151
 Anyway, I have to break up with her.

84
00:03:52,186 --> 00:03:53,898
Okay, just let her down easy.

85
00:03:55,263 --> 00:03:57,941
Danni, I'm not sure how to do this but, uh...

86
00:03:57,976 --> 00:04:00,218
I just don't think we should see each other anymore.

87
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:03,391
Cool. I'm already kinda sleeping with 
this guy named Danny, anyway.

88
00:04:05,432 --> 00:04:08,209
Whoa! I guess she wasn't calling out her own name after all!

89
00:04:08,244 --> 00:04:09,569
You know what! I don't even care, you know why?

90
00:04:09,604 --> 00:04:11,230
Because I bet she's calling out my name while she's sleeping with him!

91
00:04:11,265 --> 00:04:12,365
No, I don't!

92
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,725
See, like a bat, dude! Like a bat!

93
00:04:14,596 --> 00:04:15,579
Check.

94
00:04:15,614 --> 00:04:16,448
Aaaaaaaaagh!

95
00:04:24,343 --> 00:04:26,514
<i>It actually wasn't that awkward breaking up with Danni.</i>

96
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:31,917
<i>It was...a little odd that she stuck around 
for two hours to do her morning yoga.</i>

97
00:04:31,952 --> 00:04:33,996
Good morning, world!

98
00:04:35,704 --> 00:04:37,143
<i>She seems almost peaceful....</i>

99
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:39,145
Later, butt-licks!

100
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,620
<i> Maybe not.</i>

101
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,494
Oh, just make sure you got all your things out of my bedroom, okay?

102
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:45,760
 I put all my stuff at Danny's house three days ago.

103
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,324
Crunchberry, wrong pipe.

104
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:50,356
Mmm.

105
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:53,678
Hey, J.D., don't come chasing after me like you do with Elliot.

106
00:04:53,713 --> 00:04:56,587
Because if there's one thing everyone knows about John Dorian,

107
00:04:56,622 --> 00:04:59,917
it's that he always wants what he can't have.

108
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,868
That's not true, is it?

109
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:04,154
Hell no.

110
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:06,308
By the way, this is the last bowl of cereal.

111
00:05:13,143 --> 00:05:15,239
It's so hard to make myself look for an apartment

112
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,729
when I'm sharing my bed with the most beautiful girl in the world.

113
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:19,619
Really, what's his name?

114
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:24,274
<i>That made absolutely no sense, so just keep sipping.</i>

115
00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:26,655
Come on, Sean. I want you to meet this patient, Tommy.

116
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,153
He's only five, but he's got like the voice of a grown man.

117
00:05:29,188 --> 00:05:30,466
Yeah, he?

118
00:05:30,528 --> 00:05:32,666
Tommy, what are you doing out of your room?

119
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:34,148
I go where I want.

120
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:36,112
Awesome!

121
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:37,171
Yessss!

122
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:38,056
Turk!

123
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:38,583
Hm?

124
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:40,647
Everything's wrong again!

125
00:05:40,682 --> 00:05:42,994
Baby, it's cool. We're meeting with the cake guy tomorrow.

126
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:44,961
Nothing's cool! Nothing's cool!

127
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:45,474
Okay, okay

128
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:47,432
The centerpieces are supposed to be cupids,

129
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:49,971
but they have no arrows, so now they're just fat babies.

130
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:54,429
I have 187 people who RSVP'd "yes" for a 125-seat wedding.

131
00:05:54,464 --> 00:05:56,660
Plus, I have to wear my grandmother's choker,

132
00:05:56,695 --> 00:05:59,682
but with my hair up it makes me look like one of those African tribeswomen

133
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:00,749
with a coil around my neck!

134
00:06:00,784 --> 00:06:03,734
Okay, first of all, you best be nice to my cousin, Infume.

135
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:08,164
Second, baby, if we have too many guests, you can un-invite some people.

136
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,111
Really?

137
00:06:09,146 --> 00:06:11,151
Really. It'll be fine.

138
00:06:11,257 --> 00:06:13,465
Close your eyes.

139
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,739
Take a deep breath.

140
00:06:15,774 --> 00:06:19,729
See how good that feels? Now take another one.

141
00:06:19,764 --> 00:06:21,771
Take another one.

142
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:23,927
Are you watching my boobs?

143
00:06:23,962 --> 00:06:25,855
Deep breath!

144
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:28,688
Nice!

145
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:30,772
Ah, thank you, Shirley.

146
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,313
Dammit all to hell, Bob! I cannot believe you're gonna turn this hospital

147
00:06:34,348 --> 00:06:38,242
into some money-making machine that coerces 
people into spending their hard-earned cash

148
00:06:38,277 --> 00:06:40,548
on expensive procedures that they don't even need!

149
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,663
Why not? It sounds like something I'd do.

150
00:06:42,698 --> 00:06:46,187
You mark my words, if one single person gets a full body scan,

151
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:49,701
I will...I will kiss your ring.

152
00:06:49,736 --> 00:06:52,574
I'll take that bet, champ! You're our witness, Laverne.

153
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:54,842
How very exciting for all of us.

154
00:06:54,877 --> 00:06:58,054
I'm not even sweatin'! Because, honest to God,

155
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:01,306
what kind of gullible chump would go ahead and spend a thousand dollars

156
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:04,214
on some silly scan if he's feeling perfectly fine?

157
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:07,955
Hello, Laverne! Shirley!

158
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,863
Oh.

159
00:07:11,623 --> 00:07:12,400
How's the chicken today?

160
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:15,125
Oh, my God! Turk! What if someone's vegetarian!?

161
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,861
I gotta go call the caterer!

162
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,110
Thank you. I just calmed her down.

163
00:07:20,145 --> 00:07:23,624
She's quite mad, you know. I hope she doesn't rub off on you.

164
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:26,045
Oh! Too easy.

165
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,294
Please, man. I'm Christopher Duncan Turk.

166
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:30,466
Duncan?

167
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:31,411
His dad loved doughnuts.

168
00:07:31,446 --> 00:07:33,489
 That's not true. Okay, you really need to stop saying that.

169
00:07:33,524 --> 00:07:35,795
The point is, I don't lose my cool.

170
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,175
I don't know. Remember back in college,

171
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,599
when we had tickets to see Michael Jordan in the playoffs?

172
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:45,435
We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! We're goin' to see Michael Jordan!

173
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,872
We're goin' to see Michael Jordan! 'Cause we got good tickets!

174
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:51,366
We went five hundred miles.

175
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:53,946
Hey, was I supposed to bring the tickets or the sandwiches?

176
00:08:04,031 --> 00:08:05,409
Oh, God.

177
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:09,152
OH! NO! Leave it on the floor! You leave it on the floor!

178
00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:13,480
You shaved your head for the first time after that.

179
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:16,579
God, I wish we could go back in time and see that game.

180
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:18,052
Wanting what you can't have.

181
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:21,568
Why are you here? Hospitals don't sell cigarettes!

182
00:08:21,603 --> 00:08:23,192
Man, I'd smoke her.

183
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:24,554
Quiet time, Todd.

184
00:08:28,276 --> 00:08:31,180
I wanna know everything that's wrong with me.

185
00:08:31,215 --> 00:08:35,373
Mr. Corman, you're not even feeling bad! You don't need this scan!

186
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:38,027
If it would make you happy, we can just go ahead and do

187
00:08:38,062 --> 00:08:40,977
the exact same thing we've done the last fifty times you've been in here

188
00:08:41,012 --> 00:08:43,432
take your temperature, draw some blood, and give you a rectal.

189
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:45,213
t's your basic "Ah, Ow, OH!"

190
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:46,834
Why should I even listen to you?

191
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:50,235
The last time I was here, you tried to torture me to prove a point. Dr.--Dr.--Dr.--

192
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,226
Cox.

193
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:52,549
Mengele!

194
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:53,418
Uh!

195
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:56,178
Now, if you will excuse me, I've already talked to the insurance company,

196
00:08:56,213 --> 00:08:59,124
so there is nothing you can say that can stop me from doing this!

197
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:02,904
Now, Mr. Corman, apparently your insurance company's not gonna cover it.

198
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:04,983
Good day to you, sir.

199
00:09:07,953 --> 00:09:09,209
I'm ready to make the first incision.

200
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:11,484
Nah-uh! You get to retract the pannus.

201
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,325
You want me to hold the fat flaps?

202
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,736
More than anything in the world.
Todd! You're up!

203
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:17,719
Thank you!

204
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:18,852
Oh, man!

205
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:21,309
Now this is your big shot, so if you don't want me to throw you out of here,

206
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:24,974
you've gotta get through this whole procedure without making a single sex joke.

207
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:26,110
No problem.

208
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:30,123
All right, to really get at this, I think we need to go in from behind.

209
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,579
AND STAY OUT!

210
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,281
Totally worth it!

211
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:41,503
You're pathetic!

212
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:42,182
What!?

213
00:09:42,217 --> 00:09:44,572
For three years I've been watching you pine after Blonde Doctor,

214
00:09:44,607 --> 00:09:46,584
and I gotta tell you, everyone is sick of it

215
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,361
"Will they? Won't they? Looks like they're going to!

216
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:50,327
Oooh, the last second, something might-- oooh oooh oooh!"

217
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:54,218
Come on! Enough already! I mean, you guys aren't exactly Ross and Rachel.

218
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:55,162
Who?

219
00:09:55,197 --> 00:09:57,733
Dr. Ross, and Rachel from Bookkeeping.

220
00:09:57,768 --> 00:09:59,472
Mmm.

221
00:09:59,507 --> 00:10:04,838
Why don't you just let her be happy with...stunningly handsome, full-lipped guy.

222
00:10:04,873 --> 00:10:07,108
You know, I--I don't even care what you think.

223
00:10:07,143 --> 00:10:10,551
<i>In the heat of battle, it's important to hold your ground.</i>

224
00:10:10,586 --> 00:10:12,063
Doctor.

225
00:10:12,098 --> 00:10:18,262
Well, now, Bobbo, you hooked him, you got him in the boat, but he still got away!

226
00:10:18,297 --> 00:10:21,549
<i>Because victory can be snatched away at the last second.</i>

227
00:10:21,584 --> 00:10:24,420
Mr. Corman, your full body scan is on the house.

228
00:10:24,455 --> 00:10:26,878
I'm listening.

229
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:30,030
Excuse me.

230
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:31,011
Mm-hmm.

231
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:32,598
<i>Sometimes you don't even know how it happened.</i>

232
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:36,945
Baby, I don't get it. Last night I was the golden boy, and now I'm fat flap guy.

233
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,440
Why would Dr. Miller turn on me? I've been great in surgery,

234
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:42,198
I've been nice to her...she's coming to the wedding!

235
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:43,227
No, she's not.

236
00:10:43,262 --> 00:10:44,172
What?

237
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:45,267
I un-invited her.

238
00:10:48,205 --> 00:10:51,275
<i>Yep, it's amazing how your world can change in an instant.</i>

239
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,393
You guys! Guess what.

240
00:10:53,428 --> 00:10:56,755
I just asked Sean if he would move in with me and...tell 'em what you said!

241
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,041
"Yes!"

242
00:10:58,076 --> 00:10:59,706
Isn't that great!

243
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:01,794
That is great! Isn't that great?

244
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:04,096
<i>Full-lipped bastard.</i>

245
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:05,418
Great!

246
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,816
<i>What does Sean have that I don't have?</i>

247
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:16,048
Don't compare yourself to him. He's better.

248
00:11:19,507 --> 00:11:22,158
Thanks for the lift. Because, for some reason on Tuesdays,

249
00:11:22,193 --> 00:11:26,625
my feet just swell up like Jiffy Pop bags. I'm sure it'll show up on the scan.

250
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,106
Oh, if anything turns up green,

251
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:32,824
it's probably an emerald that I swallowed from 
my mother's jewelry box when I was five.

252
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,486
Gee, I'd like to get that back to her....

253
00:11:34,521 --> 00:11:36,074
Hey, what's going on?

254
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:37,284
Zip it. I know a shortcut.

255
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:38,577
Help! I'm getting chair-jacked!

256
00:11:38,612 --> 00:11:42,092
Okay, why are you mad? You told me to un-invite people!

257
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:43,945
So, without asking, you went to my new boss

258
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,758
and told her you didn't want her to come to the wedding.

259
00:11:45,793 --> 00:11:48,376
Nooo. I told her we didn't want her to come.

260
00:11:58,728 --> 00:12:01,000
Well, hello there. Can I give you some help?

261
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:03,873
My mommy said you had lollipops. Gimme a red one!

262
00:12:03,908 --> 00:12:05,991
So, moving in together, huh?

263
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:08,333
Yeah.... It's a little scary.

264
00:12:08,368 --> 00:12:10,034
<i>And just like that I saw my window.</i>

265
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:14,539
 It is scary! You know, I knew this girl in college who moved in with her boyfriend?

266
00:12:14,574 --> 00:12:16,243
Everything changed -- stopped talking to each other,

267
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,316
started fighting all the time and...you know the rest.

268
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:20,967
They broke up?

269
00:12:21,002 --> 00:12:22,741
Oh, no, he killed her.

270
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:27,548
Dr. Reid? They need you to check on that stabbing victim in Room 301?

271
00:12:29,326 --> 00:12:30,573
Could be you!

272
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:31,559
What?

273
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:32,461
Nothing.

274
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:36,799
Don't do that.

275
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:37,895
Why are you here, Sean?

276
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,502
Elliot listens to you, J.D. Why are you messing with her head?

277
00:12:40,537 --> 00:12:41,978
It's 'cause he wants what he can't have.

278
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:45,946
Okay, new rule! Hospitals are for doctors and sick people only! Okay?

279
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:48,515
Look, J.D., you've had so many chances,

280
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,839
and you never stepped up to the plate.

281
00:12:49,874 --> 00:12:53,956
Me, I'm terrified, but I'm going for it because 
that's how much Elliot and I mean to each other.

282
00:12:53,991 --> 00:12:57,405
We work. So if you really care about her, you won't mess this up.

283
00:13:02,902 --> 00:13:07,645
Un-invite my boss, huh? Well, we'll see how she 
likes it when I mess with her world, huh?

284
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,458
Listen, I appreciate the lunch.

285
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:19,862
But are you actually trying to convince me, 
an admittedly frugal hypochondriac,

286
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:22,062
not to get a free full body scan?

287
00:13:22,097 --> 00:13:24,981
Mr. Corman, you're not dying of anything!

288
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:29,637
Although if you do try to swipe one more bite 
of my lamb medallions I will be forced to kill you.

289
00:13:29,672 --> 00:13:31,111
Well, look who never learned to share.

290
00:13:31,146 --> 00:13:34,333
Listen to me! I am not losing a bet to Bob Kelso!

291
00:13:34,368 --> 00:13:39,358
All this concern about my health and my well-being, and it's about a bet!?

292
00:13:39,393 --> 00:13:41,891
You know what, that's a pretty reprehensible thing to do!

293
00:13:41,926 --> 00:13:45,859
Well, if you'll excuse me, I have a full body scan to take!

294
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:50,555
You drove me here.

295
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,633
I'd like to see a dessert menu, please.

296
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:58,788
Miss Espinosa, it was a little difficult changing your cake at the last minute,

297
00:13:58,823 --> 00:14:01,625
but I was able to make it non-dairy like you requested.

298
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,105
My Uncle Ramon thanks you,

299
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,828
and the rest of the people at table 3 thank you even more.

300
00:14:05,863 --> 00:14:09,718
Oh, it's perfect! Isn't it Turk?

301
00:14:09,753 --> 00:14:12,070
What's up with the white people on top?

302
00:14:12,105 --> 00:14:15,131
Turk, they don't have tiny plastic interracial couples.

303
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,739
 I'll just color it in with some chocolate frosting.

304
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:21,319
Oh, that's a great idea. Put 'em in blackface.

305
00:14:21,354 --> 00:14:21,880
Turk!

306
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:24,882
What? While you're at it, why don't you put a string in the back of him,

307
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:27,271
so when you pull it he sings "Mammy"!

308
00:14:27,306 --> 00:14:28,102
Forget it.

309
00:14:28,137 --> 00:14:29,502
Where're you going?

310
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:32,222
To the back of the bakery where you keep all the other colored cakes?

311
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:35,926
I'ma call Jesse! And we gonna march on your ass!

312
00:14:39,214 --> 00:14:40,205
Mm!

313
00:14:42,545 --> 00:14:43,483
Hey, Elliot.

314
00:14:43,518 --> 00:14:46,014
Uh, look, I was just goofing around before...

315
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:49,229
about that whole thing. I think it's great you guys are moving in together.

316
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:53,424
Thanks, J.D. I...really needed to hear that from you.

317
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,435
<i>Maybe it's true that I'm someone who only wants what he can't have.</i>

318
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,498
<i>But what if the thing I want is the girl I'm supposed to end up with?</i>

319
00:15:01,738 --> 00:15:03,264
 It should be me.

320
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:05,039
What?

321
00:15:05,074 --> 00:15:08,478
Look, Elliot: Every year we bounce around this thing,

322
00:15:08,513 --> 00:15:11,502
and I never have the courage to stand up and tell you how I feel.

323
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:15,848
I'm crazy about you. And I want you to know

324
00:15:15,883 --> 00:15:20,684
if I had the choice of hanging around with anyone in 
the entire world or staying at home with you,

325
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:24,312
eating pizza and watching a crappy TV show, I'd choose you every time.

326
00:15:25,418 --> 00:15:31,012
I.... Um.... I have to go.

327
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:41,215
Not yet, you don't.

328
00:15:42,236 --> 00:15:45,373
For Pete's sake.... 
Will you leave me alone?

329
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:49,077
Look! This baby would mess with a normal person's mind.

330
00:15:49,112 --> 00:15:53,619
So please hear me when I say that if you get this scan, it will ruin you.

331
00:15:53,654 --> 00:15:56,720
The next year of your life is gonna be a series of endless tests,

332
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,402
and I'll do whatever it takes to keep that from happening to you.

333
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:02,577
Even if it means giving you free medical treatment the rest of your life.

334
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:04,770
How can I believe that you even care about me?

335
00:16:05,752 --> 00:16:07,537
How are we doing, Mr. Corman?

336
00:16:07,572 --> 00:16:13,772
Oh, uh, Bob. We, uh, we just had our scan. You win.

337
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,397
And...?

338
00:16:17,816 --> 00:16:21,778
Now, Perry, I know that was our first date, but next time,

339
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:23,792
don't be afraid to put a little feeling into it.

340
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:31,988
There you go. It's damn sure not about the bet anymore. 
You do whatever you want.

341
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:39,473
I cannot believe you are freaking out about this! It's a great idea!

342
00:16:39,508 --> 00:16:42,237
Turk! We are not having wedding PIE!

343
00:16:42,272 --> 00:16:43,872
That is so typical of you, Carla!

344
00:16:43,907 --> 00:16:46,104
This whole wedding has been about you, and I'll prove it!

345
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,539
Give me back my wedding planner!

346
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:55,257
Frank Sinatra as our first dance. Please, baby, 
that guy has only got one good song.

347
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:59,485
You got...pink roses. I hate pink! Big screen TV at the reception!

348
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:03,756
Big screen TV at the reception?

349
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,288
I knew how much you wanted to see the play-offs.

350
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:10,142
You did that for me?

351
00:17:10,177 --> 00:17:14,887
<i>It's amazing how one simple gesture can bring you back from the brink.</i>

352
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:30,681
Hey! So, U-Haul is parked outside, everything I own is in there.

353
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:35,594
Well, except for this half of my salad tongs, but I-I 
was using it to scratch myself on the way over.

354
00:17:38,248 --> 00:17:39,735
This isn't gonna work.

355
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:43,741
<i>I guess the funny thing about love is you never know how things are gonna work out.</i>

356
00:17:47,523 --> 00:17:51,718
<i>Like me. I lost Elliot. But at least I went down swinging.</i>

357
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:57,947
Elliot? What are you doing?

358
00:18:00,603 --> 00:18:01,630
What are we watching?

359
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:03,558
'Little House on the Prairie.'

360
00:18:03,593 --> 00:18:04,652
Mm.

361
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:09,330
If you're wondering what this is, Perry,

362
00:18:09,365 --> 00:18:13,222
it's a list of the hundreds of people who've already signed up for our full body scan.

363
00:18:13,257 --> 00:18:14,892
Well, bully for you, there, Bobbo.

364
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,727
<i>Sometimes the smallest victory is enough to get you through the day.</i>

365
00:18:17,762 --> 00:18:19,540
I didn't get the scan.

366
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:21,695
I know you didn't, Mr. Corman.

367
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,359
Please, call me Harvey.

368
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:26,731
"Harvey Corman"?

369
00:18:26,766 --> 00:18:29,981
Doesn't get me as much action as you'd think.

370
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:32,701
Anyway, about that free medical care?

371
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:37,616
I'm gonna need your home number. You know, just in case...

372
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:38,787
...Just in case. Heh.

373
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:44,639
Do you want me to re-invite her?

374
00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:46,038
Do you want her there?

375
00:18:46,073 --> 00:18:50,121
No. She's too pretty. I want people looking at me.

376
00:18:50,156 --> 00:18:51,896
Okay, she's out.

377
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,881
Dr. Turk. Meet me in the O.R.

378
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:56,923
Fat flaps?

379
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,962
You got it!

380
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,154
I love fat flaps.

381
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:07,026
I love you!

382
00:19:08,926 --> 00:19:11,321
<i>As for me, all I needed was Elliot.</i>

383
00:19:11,356 --> 00:19:13,253
J.D., it's just so weird.

384
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:18,280
I mean, my whole future was right there 
in front of me, and I just walked away.

385
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:20,177
All because of you.

386
00:19:20,212 --> 00:19:22,861
Well, I think you made the right choice.

387
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:26,686
I think that the problem with most people who want what they can't have is that,

388
00:19:26,721 --> 00:19:32,203
when they actually get the thing they covet, 
they don't want it anymore. But not this guy.

389
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:40,605
Well, Dr. Dorian, you have me. You finally have me.

390
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,006
Oh, my God! I DON'T WANT HER!
