1
00:00:02,795 --> 00:00:04,171
Today started out like any other day....

2
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:08,504
Ohhh. Dolphins won again.

3
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:09,999
Mmm.

4
00:00:10,723 --> 00:00:11,701
Here you go.

5
00:00:12,202 --> 00:00:13,607
I'm gonna be hearing about this all day.

6
00:00:16,705 --> 00:00:19,121
Dr Cox and Jordan were still
looking for a pedetrician.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,389
This time, try not to
scare off the doctor.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,242
I did not scare off the last guy!

9
00:00:23,243 --> 00:00:24,519
You bit him.

10
00:00:24,705 --> 00:00:26,651
I _tripped_ and my
teeth hit his shoulder.

11
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:29,500
Uh-huh. And once that happened,
did you clamp down a little bit?

12
00:00:30,218 --> 00:00:30,677
Jordan!

13
00:00:31,552 --> 00:00:31,876
Oh, you come on!

14
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:33,683
Well, he had a bad attitude!

15
00:00:33,902 --> 00:00:37,078
Zachary, remember what Mr. Cookiepants
always says about blowing your nose:

16
00:00:37,347 --> 00:00:40,833
"If it's clear, have no fear; if
it's bloody, come see your buddy!"

17
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:43,849
What do you want?

18
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:46,458
Well, we're looking for a new
pediatrician for our son....

19
00:00:46,723 --> 00:00:49,009
And you figured that, even
though my patient load is full,

20
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,222
since you're on the board
of directors and Dr. Cox here

21
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,876
is not only an attending
at the hospital but

22
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,482
also an internationally
renowned pain-in-the-ass,

23
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:57,385
you both could show complete
disregard for my schedule

24
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,226
and make me want to cause
you grievous bodily harm

25
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:00,514
even before we were
properly introduced...?

26
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:03,694
Helloooo. I'm Dr. Norris.

27
00:01:04,663 --> 00:01:05,012
Charmed.

28
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,108
Like I said: Same ol', same ol'.

29
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:10,498
Heh-hah-hah. You
drew on the wall.

30
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:14,454
You drew on the wall!

31
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:15,780
You pulled the paper away!

32
00:01:16,165 --> 00:01:17,924
Stop lyin'. It's gonna come off, right?

33
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:24,093
Dan, don't! That's dad's indelible
space pen! And prom is in like two weeks!

34
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:32,425
Good evening Mr. and Mrs. Shefford.
I'm...here to pick up Amy for...prom.

35
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:37,168
Yeah, that, that'll come
off, you won't have to

36
00:01:37,169 --> 00:01:39,041
get laser surgery or skin
from your ass or anything.

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,528
Hmm?

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,200
Come on!

41
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:59,766
In a hospital, lots of things last
longer than you wish they would....

42
00:02:00,107 --> 00:02:01,551
Especially certain stupid relationships

43
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:04,089
with stupid Sea World trainers
who stole my stupid girl!

44
00:02:06,743 --> 00:02:09,135
Well, I've, uh, I've
got whales to train.

45
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:10,436
Stupid whales.

46
00:02:11,913 --> 00:02:13,705
Hey, Sean! Right on, brother!

47
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:15,139
Bye.

48
00:02:15,457 --> 00:02:16,157
Bye!

49
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:17,548
Where the hell are my interns!?

50
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:21,487
As third-year residents, you really
have to stay on top of your interns.

51
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,698
These! Right here! You see these names!?

52
00:02:25,302 --> 00:02:28,158
They are called patients!
This one needs brain work!

53
00:02:28,563 --> 00:02:29,481
This one needs a heart!

54
00:02:29,846 --> 00:02:30,506
This guy needs courage.

55
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,659
Helping or hurting,
J.D.? Helping or hurting?

56
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,616
The point is, they
will live or die based

57
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,613
on your lame-assed post-ops; so,
please, people, shape the hell up!

58
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:39,759
Yes, Dr. Turk.

59
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:42,764
Dr. Jerk!

60
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:47,319
The girl one just called you "Dr. Jerk"!

61
00:02:48,013 --> 00:02:49,756
No sweat. You should hear
what they call Dr. Michead.

62
00:02:53,524 --> 00:02:54,967
I decided to take a different
tack with my interns.

63
00:02:55,908 --> 00:02:58,260
Look, guys, I'm not here
to overwork ya, okay?

64
00:02:58,369 --> 00:03:01,279
I'm not--I'm not just your
resident -- I'm your buddy,

65
00:03:02,396 --> 00:03:03,376
I'm your go-to guy....

66
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:06,436
I'm J.D.

67
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:08,977
Of course, my tack
had its own drawbacks.

68
00:03:09,528 --> 00:03:13,246
But it is crucial I have everyone
here at 9 a.m. sharp tomorrow, okay?

69
00:03:13,615 --> 00:03:15,648
Oh, uh...is it cool if I come at 9:30?

70
00:03:15,756 --> 00:03:17,177
Absolutely. Anyone else need to be late?

71
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:17,983
I can't.

72
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:18,456
Bad for me.

73
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:20,671
Okay, well, why don't we--why don't
we just make it 10, then? Okay?

74
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:21,389
Break!

75
00:03:25,111 --> 00:03:25,995
I can be here at 9.

76
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:27,140
But I said 10!

77
00:03:29,446 --> 00:03:30,902
I guess everyone has their own style.

78
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:33,358
Today for lunch, the cafeteria has... 

79
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:35,586
Bruce, name a manifestation of
normal pressure hydrocephalus!

80
00:03:35,978 --> 00:03:36,984
Urinary incontinence!

81
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,134
He-hell yes, Bruce!
Go place a Foley cath.

82
00:03:39,857 --> 00:03:40,810
On Bed 4! As for the
rest of Team E, I'm--

83
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:45,824
Well, if it isn't Dr. Haircut and
her not-ready-for-primetime players!

84
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:49,275
Actually, sir, we rock, so feel
free to sit back and enjoy the show!

85
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,310
Well, don't worry about it, son,
those things are a dime a dozen.

86
00:03:55,258 --> 00:03:55,586
Really?

87
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,199
In fact, if you get bored,
why don't you just hijack

88
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:01,846
an ice cream truck and drive it
through our brand new pathology lab?

89
00:04:02,516 --> 00:04:04,453
But do me a favor and
spare the paper shredder,

90
00:04:04,771 --> 00:04:07,204
because I'll need that to
turn your next twelve paychecks

91
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,810
into a clown wig you can wear
for the rest of your internship!

92
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,984
Dr. Reid, you may have an
exciting new look and a boyfriend

93
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,175
who smells vaguely like my
tackle-box, but I remain,

94
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,908
as always, underwhelmed.

95
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:27,979
I think, Dr. Norris,
what we're looking for

96
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:31,784
is someone who's not too alarmist
but also not too lax, either.

97
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:34,148
Oh, God, please let that someone be me!

98
00:04:34,903 --> 00:04:36,966
Look, you're obviously a
little busy with your doll....

99
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:41,490
My doll? It's a collectible.

100
00:04:42,771 --> 00:04:43,938
Someone's gonna get his ass bit!

101
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:46,377
Right.... I think we
should probably take off.

102
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:49,014
We're gonna be back to
you with our decision.

103
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:51,074
Super. I'll be by my
giant pretend phone,

104
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:52,221
pretending to give a crap.

105
00:04:52,934 --> 00:04:57,840
- Oh, uh, by the way...
-Brrring! Helloo? Gotta take it.

106
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,790
Uh-huh....
Uh-huh....

107
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:02,157
I love him!

108
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,751
Of course you
do -- he's you!

109
00:05:04,356 --> 00:05:06,054
And nobody loves you more
than you! You know that.

110
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:08,672
Yeah, but, still.... He
_is_ the best pediatrician

111
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,897
on staff, and since we
both work here we're gonna

112
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,953
have a lot of pull over
him. I mean, come on, Jordan,

113
00:05:13,243 --> 00:05:15,330
you haven't let me make
one decision about our son.

114
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,938
Which is why, by the way,
you'll be doing the answering

115
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:21,988
when he asks why daddy's wee-wee
doesn't have a turtleneck on it like his.

116
00:05:22,716 --> 00:05:23,632
Yeah, fine. Whatever you said.

117
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:28,100
Hey, Carla? Hey.... I
had to redo the NG tube

118
00:05:28,184 --> 00:05:31,211
one of your nurses put on Mrs.
Hemmel, so if you could spread the word

119
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:33,848
to leave that to me and
my guys, it would be great.

120
00:05:34,474 --> 00:05:35,926
Oh, no problem, Bambi.
Oh! But the reason

121
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:40,274
my nurses had to do that is because
none of your interns know how.

122
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:42,422
So if you keep flapping your mouth

123
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:45,820
without knowing all the facts, I'm
gonna see if I can fit my foot in it!

124
00:05:46,552 --> 00:05:47,377
Okay. Good talk!

125
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:50,980
Brian? You know how to
place an NG tube, don't you?

126
00:05:51,543 --> 00:05:52,396
You did it for me both times.

127
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,597
Jimmy, didn't you do one yesterday?

128
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:57,051
No, you let me go home 'cause I forgot

129
00:05:57,155 --> 00:05:58,826
to set my TiVo for the
Styx 'Behind the Music'?

130
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:01,969
Do not miss that! It's awesome! Seth?

131
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:07,008
That was when I realized what
I'd turned my interns into.

132
00:06:15,526 --> 00:06:17,619
Bruce! This is gonna be your
third Foley cath. in a row!

133
00:06:18,052 --> 00:06:19,174
You can do this. You didn't need

134
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,599
to page me seventeen
times between the time

135
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,002
I bought the rum-raisin
muffin and then...

136
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,768
threw it away because
alcoholism runs in my family.

137
00:06:26,956 --> 00:06:30,471
After this morning, I just wanted to
make sure that I _really_ have this down.

138
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:38,954
What are you doing?

139
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:42,197
It's just a nervous habit.
It helps me concentrate.

140
00:06:42,973 --> 00:06:44,108
Yeah, well, you know
what helps me concentrate?

141
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:45,452
Me not doing that?

142
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:47,019
No, bunnies.

143
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,239
Say, I don't want to
embarrass you, there,

144
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:56,588
Big Jack, but, uh...you've got
a little something on your face.

145
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:01,023
Hardly notice it.

146
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:05,391
What was that?

147
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:08,669
Come on, Jordan. Don't
tell me you're gonna be one

148
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:11,248
of those parents who makes a big
deal out of every single cough.

149
00:07:14,985 --> 00:07:15,824
Look out, Michead!

150
00:07:18,975 --> 00:07:23,002
Okay, tough guy. Good night!

151
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:26,828
What the!? Maybe I
diluted this too much.

152
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:34,610
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

153
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:36,922
Eh, can't blame the cleanser.

154
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:41,038
Even though my interns sucked, I
decided to turn it into a positive.

155
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:44,700
Elliot, uh, I need some pointers
on how to deal with my interns.

156
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,847
aaagghhh-hagh-haaaaggghhhh!!!!..

157
00:07:48,222 --> 00:07:48,585
Hey, Doug.

158
00:07:49,644 --> 00:07:51,810
Anyway, do you think we could, like,
meet up after work or something?

159
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,540
Sure. What'd you have in mind?

160
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:10,887
No! Don't do it!

161
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:22,391
Nothin' major.

162
00:08:24,957 --> 00:08:26,293
You know, Benjamin, it's not a bad thing

163
00:08:26,396 --> 00:08:28,092
that you play with it,
it's just that your mom

164
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,455
wants you to take breaks for meals!

165
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:32,304
Excuse me, Jack here, uh,
Jack here's got a cough.

166
00:08:32,573 --> 00:08:34,234
And on account of the meconium
problem he had at birth,

167
00:08:34,368 --> 00:08:35,742
I'm thinking it just might be pneumonia.

168
00:08:38,176 --> 00:08:41,806
Take this cup, fill 'er up, right?

169
00:08:44,052 --> 00:08:46,381
What in the hell do
you think you are doing?

170
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:49,031
You arrogant son of a
bitch, if you ever interrupt

171
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,529
an exam of mine again, I will personally

172
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:52,338
take my stethoscope
and shove it up your---

173
00:08:52,558 --> 00:08:55,024
Benjamin! What happened?

174
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:55,958
I don't have to go.

175
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:57,575
Oh, well it happens
to the big boys, too.

176
00:08:57,722 --> 00:08:58,745
Try again. Go on!

177
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,036
Is his temperature under
a hundred-point-five?

178
00:09:01,076 --> 00:09:01,725
Barely.

179
00:09:02,172 --> 00:09:03,087
Eating, peeing, pooing?

180
00:09:03,317 --> 00:09:04,617
Sometimes all at the same time. Come on,

181
00:09:05,154 --> 00:09:06,681
it's a really persistent
cough. What do you say?

182
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,416
Office hours, tomorrow,
5 o'clock. Bye-bye.

183
00:09:10,736 --> 00:09:12,364
I'm gonna go ahead and
put this in a language

184
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:14,997
that you can understand:

185
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:16,115
You had better see my son now,

186
00:09:17,243 --> 00:09:18,819
or I'm gonna kick your ass.

187
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:30,465
Okay, here she comes.
Don't be over-eager!

188
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:32,070
Elliot!!! Over here!!!

189
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:34,332
Hey!

190
00:09:35,634 --> 00:09:36,790
Wow...you look great.

191
00:09:37,682 --> 00:09:38,016
Thanks.

192
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:40,172
Oh, hey, J.D.

193
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:41,955
Hey, Sean's here, everybody...

194
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:43,592
Hey, Sean! Heeeyyy!

195
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,469
You know, since he's a
trainer, Sean is really good

196
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,756
with behavior and communication.
I mean, he helped me

197
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:51,178
so much with my interns
that I thought maybe

198
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,008
he could help you with yours.

199
00:09:52,821 --> 00:09:54,344
Okay, stay calm -- at
least she's here, too.

200
00:09:57,226 --> 00:09:58,402
Oh, Bruce again
-- gotta go.

201
00:09:58,495 --> 00:09:58,971
Bye.

202
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:04,275
This'll be fun!

203
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:08,371
And just like that, I had
another rough night ahead of me.

204
00:10:10,513 --> 00:10:11,547
At least I wasn't the only one.

205
00:10:18,406 --> 00:10:20,153
You paged me for another Foley catheter?

206
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:22,203
I'm great at these now!

207
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,273
Just watch this one.

208
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:26,353
Don't mind if I do!

209
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:31,703
Yep, it's gonna be a long, long night.

210
00:10:36,198 --> 00:10:37,835
I'm, heh, right here, Bruce.

211
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:51,066
Hello, David. I've been expecting you.

212
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:52,259
Agh!

213
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:54,926
Yeah, I just thought I'd come by and

214
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:56,566
play with some of your stuffed animals

215
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:59,164
-
- and, I know, I know, they're "for the kids", heh.

216
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:01,185
Also, wanted to let you know
that I _will_ be bringing

217
00:11:01,522 --> 00:11:02,612
my son by this _morning_.

218
00:11:02,981 --> 00:11:04,105
Yeah, I don't think so, there, chief.

219
00:11:08,263 --> 00:11:09,084
Where's Mr. Cookiepants?

220
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:11,157
Oh, que pasa?

221
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:13,429
I said, Where's Mr. Cookiepants!?

222
00:11:14,224 --> 00:11:15,401
He's in a safe place, Dave.

223
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:17,261
If you touch one hair on
his head, I swear to God

224
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,544
I'll inject your kid with chickenpox!

225
00:11:19,168 --> 00:11:19,887
No, you won't.

226
00:11:21,188 --> 00:11:21,576
I know.

227
00:11:22,624 --> 00:11:24,446
For God's sakes, it's
an innocent doll!!!

228
00:11:24,981 --> 00:11:27,331
No, David. It's a collectible.

229
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:30,795
Whatever.

230
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:34,106
The kid's a good doctor, he just...

231
00:11:34,213 --> 00:11:36,549
falls apart every time Kelso
looks over his shoulder.

232
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:39,210
Well, why don't you just
tell Kelso to back off?

233
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:41,655
I-I've taken a lot of
positive steps this year

234
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:43,426
but when it comes to standing
up to Kelso, I just...

235
00:11:44,385 --> 00:11:46,906
I can't get over that hump
yet. He's like my white whale.

236
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:48,653
Yeah.... Mine's Frank.

237
00:11:50,803 --> 00:11:51,877
Oh, no, I meant like
in 'Moby Dick' --

238
00:11:52,901 --> 00:11:54,170
Kelso is a giant pain in my ass.

239
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:59,171
Oh. Well, thing is,
I love Frank. Just...

240
00:11:59,408 --> 00:12:01,982
he can drive me crazy
every now and then.

241
00:12:04,674 --> 00:12:09,906
Every day! Every day! Every day!

242
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:15,312
Hey, J.D.? I was thinking
we'd start out by me,

243
00:12:15,463 --> 00:12:16,890
you know, watching how you
interact with your interns.

244
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:19,179
Uh, and then, your
brain's gonna tell you

245
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:20,388
to be a little self-conscious,
but you just need

246
00:12:20,482 --> 00:12:21,545
to ignore the voice in your head.

247
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,535
Kick him in the crotch and run.

248
00:12:24,253 --> 00:12:25,158
I'll try, Sean!

249
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:28,168
You be nice to the teacher,
okay? I'm sleeping with him.

250
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:31,100
Oh, my God! I haven't
said that since college!

251
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,277
Mmmmgh! Norris hasn't
budged, and he just moved

252
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:37,540
the appointment back
to six, the rat-bastard!

253
00:12:37,846 --> 00:12:39,501
Watch your language in front of the kid,

254
00:12:39,598 --> 00:12:40,418
you stupid bicky-bicky!

255
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:45,066
You see, _I_ am adapting.
You, on the other hand,

256
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:46,220
are behaving like a complete lunatic.

257
00:12:46,592 --> 00:12:46,979
No, I'm not!

258
00:12:56,271 --> 00:12:56,742
Carla?

259
00:12:58,056 --> 00:12:59,507
You're one of them bossy-pants types

260
00:12:59,617 --> 00:13:01,320
who always tells people their problems

261
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:02,730
whether they ask for it or not, right?

262
00:13:03,354 --> 00:13:05,195
I like to think I've
learned when to hold back.

263
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:05,899
You're in.

264
00:13:06,447 --> 00:13:08,550
You've totally lost sight
of what's important, here.

265
00:13:08,903 --> 00:13:12,348
You are a parent now, okay?
You don't come first anymore--

266
00:13:12,662 --> 00:13:12,838
No.

267
00:13:13,098 --> 00:13:14,558
-
-you've got to do what's best for your son,

268
00:13:14,864 --> 00:13:17,395
even if it means sucking up
to the one doctor on earth

269
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:18,893
who's more obnoxious than you are.

270
00:13:21,456 --> 00:13:23,275
Oh, my God. I loved doing that so much,

271
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:24,429
it makes my hand shake a little!

272
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:29,127
So, how are your interns doing?

273
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,063
Hey, yeah, it still burns a little,
but at least I can hear okay.

274
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:35,261
Fantastic, sport. But
that's the brachial artery

275
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,044
and it's not how we draw
blood. Now, if we need

276
00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:40,178
to inject him with heroin,
you'll be the first one I call.

277
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:40,963
Dr. Kelso...

278
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:43,251
What is it, Dr. Reid? Do
you have something to say?

279
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:45,540
...No.

280
00:13:46,364 --> 00:13:48,297
You know, son, you
remind me of her so much,

281
00:13:48,404 --> 00:13:51,640
you're just a break-down in the supply
closet away from being the same person!

282
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,175
Look, Brian, if you're
having that much trouble

283
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,487
with your case report, I'd be glad
to take a look at it for you, pal.

284
00:14:00,994 --> 00:14:02,216
Cool. Try to have it back by 5.

285
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:05,371
O...kay. I have a lot
of things to do...but....

286
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,876
Hey, J.D.? Can I offer a
little constructive criticism?

287
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:10,368
Kick him in the crotch,
dammit! The crotch!

288
00:14:10,915 --> 00:14:11,892
You know, you're worried
so much about whether

289
00:14:11,996 --> 00:14:13,913
your interns like you
or not that I don't think

290
00:14:14,072 --> 00:14:14,816
they respect you very much.

291
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,614
I had one of mine run out this
morning and get me some dome wax.

292
00:14:17,947 --> 00:14:19,783
Check it
-- zing!

293
00:14:21,184 --> 00:14:21,710
That's really shiny.

294
00:14:22,248 --> 00:14:22,877
Yeah!

295
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:27,353
You know, I had the same problem when
I started working with the dolphins---

296
00:14:27,463 --> 00:14:30,395
Okay, that's it. I-I-I'm
sorry, Sean, I'm a doctor, okay?

297
00:14:30,513 --> 00:14:33,391
I-I'm teaching humans,
not dolphins, okay?

298
00:14:33,828 --> 00:14:36,521
So it isn't really helpful for
me to know what works on fish.

299
00:14:36,973 --> 00:14:37,754
They're mammals, actually.

300
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:42,843
Oh, well, Sean! Unfortunately
for me, my interns aren't mammals!

301
00:14:43,544 --> 00:14:44,361
J.D., they are.

302
00:14:45,388 --> 00:14:47,174
S-sh--I don't
care, Sean!

303
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:49,016
Come on, Turk!

304
00:14:54,805 --> 00:14:58,618
Hey. I just wanted you to know
I don't have a problem with you,

305
00:14:58,715 --> 00:15:00,087
I just can't resist a good storm-off.

306
00:15:00,536 --> 00:15:00,928
Oh, who can?

307
00:15:05,313 --> 00:15:08,978
Stain, I won't lie to ya --
this is gonna hurt a little bit.

308
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,615
Why don't you just paint over it?

309
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,751
Can you believe that
crap Sean was saying?

310
00:15:19,424 --> 00:15:22,982
He was right. Even in college, you cared
way too much about everybody liking you.

311
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:27,173
Hey, who wants to help me move?

312
00:15:27,203 --> 00:15:28,114
Me!

313
00:15:30,522 --> 00:15:31,757
J.D., could you walk my dog tonight

314
00:15:31,841 --> 00:15:33,534
while I have casual sex
with your friend, Miguel?

315
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,156
Love to!

316
00:15:36,223 --> 00:15:37,615
Hey. Who wants to help me move back?

317
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:39,348
I know where it all goes...!

318
00:15:44,162 --> 00:15:46,766
Think about it, man. Cox
has taught you the most

319
00:15:46,885 --> 00:15:49,484
since you've been here,
right? Do you really think

320
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,900
he gives a damn whether
you like him or not?

321
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:51,647
I'd like to think so.

322
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,037
Out of my way, space-waster!

323
00:15:54,707 --> 00:15:55,667
I felt the love.

324
00:15:57,013 --> 00:15:58,512
Catch him and kick him in his junk!

325
00:15:59,283 --> 00:16:03,003
Enjoy. I didn't cut the hand off --
I used a different puppet for that.

326
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:06,067
Well, if you want, you could give
that one to me and I could fix it.

327
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,835
And have it...for the kids.

328
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,873
Disturbing fetishes aside, I--I
feel like I owe you an apology

329
00:16:13,063 --> 00:16:15,282
on account of acting like
a jackass. But I don't think

330
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,724
that my son should be the
one who has to pay for it.

331
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:20,079
You actually think that I
would endanger the health

332
00:16:20,184 --> 00:16:23,596
of a child because you're a jackass?
Look, buddy, most of the parents

333
00:16:23,711 --> 00:16:27,567
I deal with are jackasses; now, don't
get me wrong, you're in the top five.

334
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,810
Thank you!

335
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:31,501
You're welcome. So, the reason
why I have yet to see your child

336
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:33,242
is because he has the sniffles.

337
00:16:33,631 --> 00:16:34,338
The sniffles?

338
00:16:34,597 --> 00:16:38,708
The sniffles! Look,
you're a doctor, you have

339
00:16:38,824 --> 00:16:41,562
what I like to call The
Burden of Knowledge --

340
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:42,683
you're gonna be worse than every parent

341
00:16:42,786 --> 00:16:44,484
who freaks out because
their kid eats Play-Doh.

342
00:16:44,718 --> 00:16:47,903
Why? Because you've seen too much;

343
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:54,086
you've seen what can really go wrong.

344
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:57,117
If you can get a handle on
that, it's gonna gross you.

345
00:16:57,514 --> 00:16:57,931
You have kids?

346
00:16:58,326 --> 00:17:00,977
One. She hates dolls.

347
00:17:01,962 --> 00:17:02,582
Boy, that's a bummer.

348
00:17:02,984 --> 00:17:03,404
Tell me about it.

349
00:17:06,354 --> 00:17:07,966
That's horrible work. Horrible!

350
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:10,164
Dr. Kelso, I do have something to say.

351
00:17:11,485 --> 00:17:13,742
Remember earlier, you asked
me if I had something to say?

352
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:14,088
No!

353
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,331
Well, you did. And...the
reason that I came back here

354
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:19,470
is because you said that Bruce
and I are alike. And you know what?

355
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:22,334
You're right. Because you're
treating him the exact same way

356
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,749
you treated me when I first got here!

357
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,577
Dr. Kelso, you only judge us
by these, like, twenty-minute,

358
00:17:26,683 --> 00:17:28,806
pressure-filled windows that you see
us through twice a week, and you--

359
00:17:28,974 --> 00:17:31,851
you never get to know us or how hard
we really work. Because, if you did,

360
00:17:31,961 --> 00:17:35,527
you'd realize that a lot of the times we
fail, it's not our fault -- it's yours.

361
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:38,531
Is that how you feel, future dentist?

362
00:17:41,412 --> 00:17:45,636
W-well...sometimes you make me feel
like...I can't do anything well,

363
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:47,693
and I can do lots of things well!

364
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:48,426
Like what?

365
00:17:48,907 --> 00:17:49,905
I'm a pretty solid human beat-box.

366
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,542
Bru-Bruce, I think he was
talking about medical...things.

367
00:17:52,957 --> 00:17:56,696
No, no-no, I-I'd like to hear him
demonstrate this "beef-box" thing.

368
00:17:57,664 --> 00:18:03,983
Well--well, o-okay. Uh, I g--I guess this
one goes out to my boy, Wayne, in room 302.

369
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:07,437
He has fluid in his lungs.

370
00:18:40,971 --> 00:18:44,850
Young man! Enjoy your moment.

371
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,489
Oh, my God, Bruce! That was amazing!

372
00:18:49,242 --> 00:18:50,240
Where did you learn how to do that?

373
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:51,000
In temple.

374
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,870
You're right -- I can
totally see my reflection!

375
00:18:58,385 --> 00:18:59,219
Tell your friends, baby!

376
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:02,920
Hey, Sean, you were right
about me and my interns.

377
00:19:04,124 --> 00:19:05,238
I guess I owe you an apology.

378
00:19:05,989 --> 00:19:09,019
Damn straight, you do! You know
what your problem is, Bambi? You're--

379
00:19:09,132 --> 00:19:12,369
Oh! Turk! Please? Just one more
second? I need the rush! Please?

380
00:19:12,478 --> 00:19:14,155
I'm coming back for you!

381
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:18,829
J.D., it's no big deal. We both
know that it wasn't about that.

382
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:21,500
Well, you...you like Elliot.

383
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:23,319
Sorry.

384
00:19:23,938 --> 00:19:24,353
Don't sweat it.

385
00:19:25,126 --> 00:19:27,445
You're not pissed off? I'd be pissed
off. Why aren't you pissed off?

386
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:32,201
I dunno. I guess I just...I don't
see you as that much of a threat.

387
00:19:35,197 --> 00:19:37,519
Ohh.... Cool.

388
00:19:45,178 --> 00:19:47,744
I don't care. All that matters is
finding a way to sleep at night.

389
00:19:50,936 --> 00:19:52,650
Whether it's finally standing
up to your white whale...

390
00:19:56,901 --> 00:19:58,125
...painting over your black spot...

391
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:04,893
...or imagining Shamu
taking Sean's arm off.

392
00:20:10,213 --> 00:20:13,965
You don't need a doctor to tell you that a
good night's sleep can fix almost anything.

393
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,059
He's got fluid.
