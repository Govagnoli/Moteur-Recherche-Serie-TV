1
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,689
One of the reasons Turk and I
are so popular around here

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:07,554
is that we love helping
our fellow doctors.

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:09,568
- Hey, Hooch.
- That's my name.

4
00:00:09,752 --> 00:00:11,095
Don't wear it out.

5
00:00:11,306 --> 00:00:12,757
Classic Hooch.

6
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:14,689
Listen, even though
I'm not gonna be paid,

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,500
I'm gonna cover your shift
at the clinic tonight

8
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:18,008
so you can do
Mr. Schindler's endoscopy.

9
00:00:18,043 --> 00:00:20,484
And I'm gonna cross-cover
all of Dr. Turner's patients

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:22,796
so Turner can assist you
on the procedure.

11
00:00:22,977 --> 00:00:24,901
Why are you guys going through
so much trouble?

12
00:00:25,047 --> 00:00:27,630
Who's doing the endoscopy
on Mr Schindler?

13
00:00:28,384 --> 00:00:30,016
- Turner and Hooch!
- Turner and Hooch!

14
00:00:32,804 --> 00:00:34,665
- All right.
- Were you doing Hooch?

15
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:37,197
Everyone hates you guys.

16
00:00:37,547 --> 00:00:38,415
Oh, Hooch!

17
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,982
Hooch is crazy!

18
00:00:40,017 --> 00:00:43,182
As much as Hooch loved us, it was
even better to see Turk happy.

19
00:00:43,382 --> 00:00:45,951
See, he and Carla had recently
started couples therapy,

20
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:48,359
and I'm not sure
he was enjoying it.

21
00:00:49,168 --> 00:00:51,264
Carla says you cry after you orgasm.

22
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:53,332
Would you like to talk about that?

23
00:00:53,526 --> 00:00:55,165
No, not really.

24
00:00:56,662 --> 00:00:58,650
I decided to help their marriage
by moving out,

25
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:01,725
partly because Carla and I had
accidentally kissed and messed things up,

26
00:01:01,726 --> 00:01:03,049
but mostly because it was time.

27
00:01:03,465 --> 00:01:05,844
Still, finding an apartment
has not been easy.

28
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,654
I'm so sorry about your father.

29
00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:10,182
I'm sure he lived a wonderful life at

30
00:01:10,217 --> 00:01:13,512
14 Maple Drive, apartment 4b.

31
00:01:14,152 --> 00:01:17,963
Was he lucky enough to enjoy a washer
and dryer in his unit while he was alive?

32
00:01:20,323 --> 00:01:22,487
Ever mention any hot neighbors?

33
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:26,437
What are you doing in the on-call room?

34
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:27,839
Nothing.

35
00:01:28,058 --> 00:01:29,400
- I gotta go.
- Ok.

36
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,832
Thankfully, Turk had gotten over
the whole kissing incident.

37
00:01:32,867 --> 00:01:35,465
Still, there's a weird new thing
he does whenever he says good-bye.

38
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,946
Ok, I'll see you around.

39
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:40,490
Peace, homey.

40
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:44,650
Uh, do you guys think that Clarissa
is more attractive than me?

41
00:01:44,685 --> 00:01:45,545
Yes.

42
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:48,576
Who's... Clarissa?

43
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:50,880
She's the short, balding woman
in the pharmacy.

44
00:01:50,972 --> 00:01:52,546
Oh, then definitely yes.

45
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:55,708
She just got engaged,
Bad comb-over and all!

46
00:01:55,743 --> 00:01:57,304
When Clarissa
beats you to the altar,

47
00:01:57,305 --> 00:01:58,908
it might be time to
hang up the ovaries.

48
00:01:59,032 --> 00:02:00,092
Too mean!

49
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,305
How am I supposed to met a guy
worth a damn working in this place?!

50
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,341
Are the guys here really that bad?

51
00:02:06,185 --> 00:02:08,188
12 minutes door to door!

52
00:02:08,637 --> 00:02:11,373
That's a personal best, suckos!

53
00:02:13,358 --> 00:02:15,227
Nurse, suction.

54
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,044
The patient's not even here yet.

55
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:19,424
I know.

56
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:24,778
I just wish once a cute, thoughtful guy
would walk through the door.

57
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:27,737
- Hi.- Hi.

58
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:28,518
Can I get some help?

59
00:02:28,553 --> 00:02:30,715
My neighbor fainted,
and she doesn't like ambulances,

60
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,124
so I brought her in myself.

61
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,047
Let me take this one, Jenny.
You've got a phone call.

62
00:02:34,082 --> 00:02:35,490
Oh. I'll call them back.

63
00:02:35,972 --> 00:02:37,166
Your mom died.

64
00:02:37,377 --> 00:02:39,101
What?!

65
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:42,392
Her mom's fine.
It's just a little running joke we have.

66
00:02:42,807 --> 00:02:46,002
She'll be laughing later.
Got you, Jenny!

67
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:49,420
Dead mom joke's always funny.

71
00:03:03,994 --> 00:03:05,960
So, Betty, you're back with us,

72
00:03:05,995 --> 00:03:08,160
and I see you brought a young,
handsome buck with you.

73
00:03:08,161 --> 00:03:09,696
What are you trying?
To make me jealous?

74
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,070
You know you're my gal.

75
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:12,679
Who are you?

76
00:03:12,714 --> 00:03:13,587
I'm Dr Dorian.

77
00:03:13,622 --> 00:03:17,154
I'm the one that's taken care of you
the last 19 times you've been in here.

78
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:18,699
She's getting a little forgetful.

79
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,757
You know how that happens.
Are you a relative?

80
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,032
No. Neighbor.

81
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:23,656
I only met her once.

82
00:03:23,691 --> 00:03:27,351
It was raining, and you were wearing
a blue sweater.

83
00:03:27,386 --> 00:03:29,361
That's a lovely memory, Betty.

84
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:31,143
You know what else is a lovely memory?

85
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:34,590
That sunday I spent 8 hours helping you
to join the Wilford Brimley fan club.

86
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:36,952
You don't remember that, do you?

87
00:03:36,987 --> 00:03:39,371
If everything's all right here,
I'm kinda on my way to the airport.

88
00:03:39,406 --> 00:03:41,959
I'm going kayaking with
some friends in New Zealand.

89
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:43,253
Cool.

90
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:44,554
So, what are you gonna do there?

91
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:46,100
Mostly kayaking.

92
00:03:48,205 --> 00:03:51,041
So, Betty, I'll check on you
the second I get back, ok?

93
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:52,256
You get better now.

94
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:55,328
So, Elliot, the first thing
we're gonna need to do is--

95
00:03:56,057 --> 00:03:58,403
Is Dr. Reid coming back?

96
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,894
Oh don't worry about her, Betty.

97
00:03:59,895 --> 00:04:01,577
You're in good hands with Dr. Dorian.

98
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:02,878
Who's that?

99
00:04:02,913 --> 00:04:05,548
That's me, Betty, Dr. Dorian.

100
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:09,419
Cocoon. Wilford Brimley,
Steve Guttenberg, the whole day. No?

101
00:04:10,223 --> 00:04:11,187
Hey, Jake...

102
00:04:11,388 --> 00:04:12,973
So, you're probably
rushing home to

103
00:04:12,974 --> 00:04:15,282
wipe the old person smell
off before your trip, uh?

104
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:16,379
Excuse me?

105
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:19,092
No, I'm just kidding.
I love old people.

106
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:21,575
Still, there's no denying
they have a distinctive smell.

107
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,439
I mean, it's nothing bad,
it's like a...

108
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,701
general mustiness.

109
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:30,980
Like, you know, when you get
your cast taken off, and,

110
00:04:31,175 --> 00:04:32,694
skin mold.

111
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:36,833
Well, I got a flight to catch.

112
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:38,464
You guys need me to sign anything?

113
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:39,788
No. You're good.

114
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:45,045
Ok, then.

115
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,723
That's tough there, Barbie.

116
00:04:46,724 --> 00:04:51,044
That was one potent combination of
verbal diarrhea and stunned silence.

117
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,526
You should have just asked him out.
Men love that.

118
00:04:53,695 --> 00:04:55,733
No, Carla, men don't love that.

119
00:04:55,768 --> 00:04:58,812
It turns out we don't love picnics,
foreplay, candles, baths,

120
00:04:58,813 --> 00:05:01,557
photo albums, or when you drive
"so that we can relax",

121
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,259
and as always, we're not
that big on Hugues Jackman.

122
00:05:04,623 --> 00:05:05,402
Look here.

123
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:09,276
The only thing men actually care about as
far as dating is concerned is the chase.

124
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:12,460
So if you want that guy to look
in your way, listen to me carefully.

125
00:05:12,495 --> 00:05:15,165
Ignore the living hell out of him.

126
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:17,508
That's the worst advise
I've ever heard.

127
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:19,002
Good point Carla.
Say,

128
00:05:19,037 --> 00:05:21,504
you don't happen to have any other
gems you wanna lay on us

129
00:05:21,505 --> 00:05:23,721
before you run off to
couples therapy to sift through

130
00:05:23,722 --> 00:05:26,607
the wreckage that is the
first year of your marriage, do ya?

131
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:29,788
Look, Dr. Cox, I'm sure you're
fantastic at picking up men.

132
00:05:29,823 --> 00:05:30,694
Really.

133
00:05:31,774 --> 00:05:34,198
But I can handle this one
on my own. Thank you.

134
00:05:36,428 --> 00:05:39,777
Some people just cannot take a good
"your mom is dead" joke. You know.

135
00:05:41,895 --> 00:05:46,178
Anyway, I worry that
sometimes when I'm tense,

136
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,021
I could be a little condescending.

137
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,038
Actually, I've noticed that.

138
00:05:50,073 --> 00:05:52,745
Have you really noticed it,
Mr. Terapist?!

139
00:05:53,355 --> 00:05:55,603
Chris, what's going on with you?

140
00:05:56,011 --> 00:05:57,705
Nothing worth talking about.

141
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,830
This is your third visit,

142
00:05:58,831 --> 00:06:01,491
and you've yet to say anything
real about how you're feeling.

143
00:06:01,526 --> 00:06:04,206
That's because I don't think there's
anything wrong with our relationship.

144
00:06:04,548 --> 00:06:06,799
I think you pretend
that everything's ok,

145
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,314
even though deep down inside,
a lot of things are bothering you.

146
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:13,648
So, come on. Tell me what
you're thinking right now.

147
00:06:13,683 --> 00:06:15,796
I'm staring at that picture
above your head.

148
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:19,011
Yeah, now, is that one of those
psychological ink-blot tests

149
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:22,077
where I try to figure out what it is?
Because if so...

150
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:24,865
I'm seeing a duck.

151
00:06:26,164 --> 00:06:28,498
- Let's take a break.
- Okay.

152
00:06:29,715 --> 00:06:32,852
But Hooch, if the patient
just has simple cellulitis,

153
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:34,924
why aren't
the antibiotics working?

154
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,561
Damn it, Turner, it just
doesn't make sense.

155
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:41,558
Even though I had created
a supermedical crime-fighting team,

156
00:06:41,593 --> 00:06:43,325
I felt lousy.

157
00:06:43,443 --> 00:06:45,924
See, I had just told Betty that
her lungs had finally given out,

158
00:06:45,925 --> 00:06:48,057
and that she wasn't gonna
leave the hospital this time.

159
00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:49,352
So,

160
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,292
what are my choices?

161
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:55,817
Well, we could put you on
a breathing machine,

162
00:06:55,852 --> 00:06:58,032
but it's unlike that you'd
ever come off of it.

163
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:01,436
Or I could just make sure that
you're as comfortableas possible.

164
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,722
"As comfortable as possible."

165
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,776
I've said that a million times and
I still have no idea what it means.

166
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,421
There you go Betty.
That's every cotton ball in the hospital.

167
00:07:11,477 --> 00:07:17,334
I am very,
very confortable.

168
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:20,105
Then you're
ready to die.

169
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:24,182
Look, Betty, is there anyone
you'd like to talk this over with?

170
00:07:27,884 --> 00:07:30,312
She just wants to talk
to you for a minute.

171
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:31,455
Yeah?
About what?

172
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,249
Just about how and when
she should die.

173
00:07:34,284 --> 00:07:35,294
Oh, that's not a problem.

174
00:07:35,295 --> 00:07:37,596
I counsel most of my random
neighbors on their deathbeds.

175
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:39,868
Look, this woman is alone,
she's depressed,

176
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:42,784
and for some reason she feels like
she's connected with you.

177
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:44,451
Look, I'm sorry.
I wouldn't know what to say.

178
00:07:44,486 --> 00:07:45,312
That's great.

179
00:07:45,347 --> 00:07:47,677
Keep it light. Open with a joke,
and before you know it,

180
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:50,291
you and your raft will be
on a 4-hour trip to New Zealand.

181
00:07:50,326 --> 00:07:52,069
No, it's more like 14 hours.

182
00:07:52,168 --> 00:07:53,763
Oh, no, you're
dangerously close to

183
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,906
revealing that geography
is your Achilles heel.

184
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:58,318
Say something smart
to regain credibility.

185
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,565
Vaso-vagal syncope is mediated by
the autonomic nervous system.

186
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,597
And Betty needs you, pal.
She does.

187
00:08:03,632 --> 00:08:05,028
Come on.
Do it.

188
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:06,341
You'll feel good.
Trust me.

189
00:08:06,476 --> 00:08:08,764
Trust you? You don't even know
where New Zealand is.

190
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:12,297
You can dance your way there
from Old Zealand.

191
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:14,366
You an idiot?

192
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,010
Elliot...

193
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:19,235
My neighbor fainted, too.

194
00:08:19,403 --> 00:08:21,032
Hey, you want to go clubbing tonight?

195
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,899
And I don't mean dancing. I mean
going up to the roof and killing rats.

196
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:25,672
Janitor, I thought
we were done with this.

197
00:08:25,707 --> 00:08:27,102
I know.
Thought I'd give it a shot.

198
00:08:28,548 --> 00:08:30,517
Just put her back in her room.

199
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,799
She's not a patient.

200
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:33,711
I got her at the mall.

201
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:35,880
Better get you back to
the food court, huh?

202
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,808
Your husband's probably
come to by now.

203
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:42,512
Oh, my god, here he comes.
Ok, this is easy.

204
00:08:42,513 --> 00:08:45,545
Just compliment him.
Tell him he has a square head.

205
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,842
That's not a compliment.
What shape is a compliment?

206
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:50,028
Triangle?
Uh, pyramid?

207
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,131
Circle.
Circle head.

208
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:54,135
Oh, my god, you're stuck on shapes,
and square head's almost here!

209
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,405
To hell with it. Just do what
Dr. Cox said and ignore him.

210
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,546
Hey, Elliot.

211
00:09:00,308 --> 00:09:02,452
That girl's kind cute.
What's her story?

212
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,711
She's a dude.

213
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:06,083
Yeah?

214
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:08,651
Gotta look at
the Adam's apple, buddy.

215
00:09:09,111 --> 00:09:10,741
Couples therapy is killing me.

216
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:12,223
I don't know how you do it--

217
00:09:12,258 --> 00:09:15,238
Make love with your lady in front
of some old dude who's filming you?

218
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:17,184
That's not couples therapy, Todd.

219
00:09:17,547 --> 00:09:18,740
Then what did I do?

220
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:19,953
You did amateur porn.

221
00:09:20,507 --> 00:09:21,821
Sweet.

222
00:09:23,555 --> 00:09:24,842
J.D. you got a sec?

223
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,135
Sure. I'll be with you in a minute, man.

224
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,192
So check this out.

225
00:09:28,227 --> 00:09:30,557
Our therapist says I'm
the type of guy who pretends

226
00:09:30,592 --> 00:09:34,314
everything's okay, even when
I'm upset deep down inside.

227
00:09:34,349 --> 00:09:36,720
Well I think that's true. I mean, if you
look at the whole Carla kissing thing,

228
00:09:36,755 --> 00:09:40,124
I think intellectually you moved on
but emotionally you're still upset.

229
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,436
You'll get there, though, pal.

230
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:42,720
I'm not upset.

231
00:09:42,755 --> 00:09:44,077
Really?
Oh, ok...

232
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,045
I'll see you later.
Bye.

233
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:48,180
- You see?
- See what?

234
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,695
Let's try it again.

235
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,300
I'll see you later, buddy.
Bye.

236
00:09:51,335 --> 00:09:52,018
Bye.

237
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:55,693
Always the same spot!
It's like your fingers are stone.

238
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:56,762
Last time.

239
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,307
I'll see you later, b--

240
00:09:58,342 --> 00:09:59,462
Hey! Look at yourself.

241
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,276
I've been hitting you?

242
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,101
Yeah. You're like the brown Hulk.

243
00:10:07,002 --> 00:10:09,338
Hey, how's it going in here,you two?

244
00:10:09,373 --> 00:10:10,955
Well, pretty good.
Pretty good.

245
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,931
We--we talked about her past.

246
00:10:12,966 --> 00:10:16,108
Betty even let me hear a few of her
romantic trysts from her younger days.

247
00:10:16,109 --> 00:10:17,849
Are you familiar with
Mr. David Brinkley?

248
00:10:17,937 --> 00:10:19,507
- No way.
- Yeah.

249
00:10:19,507 --> 00:10:20,506
Betty.

250
00:10:21,398 --> 00:10:23,795
Then when we finally got down
to talking for real,

251
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:26,284
well, it became pretty obvious that...

252
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:28,719
Betty had already
made a decision.

253
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:31,110
Ok.

254
00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:33,413
The thing that impressed me
most about Jake,

255
00:10:33,448 --> 00:10:36,012
besides his perfectly square head,

256
00:10:36,047 --> 00:10:38,632
was that he faced this
whole Betty thing straight on.

257
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:42,117
He thinks I'm cute.
He thinks I'm cute...

258
00:10:42,187 --> 00:10:45,198
He didn't hide because he was afraid
to admit someone was right...

259
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:46,203
...I'm cute...

260
00:10:46,238 --> 00:10:47,041
Barbie,

261
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:48,736
why so happy?

262
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:50,240
No reason.

263
00:10:52,654 --> 00:10:55,865
He didn't run because he was
scared of facing his own feelings.

264
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,509
Baby, I'm not gonna be able to
make therapy tonight.

265
00:10:58,696 --> 00:11:01,365
- I have surgery.
- Fine.

266
00:11:01,546 --> 00:11:04,687
Of course, he wouldn't have been able to
do if it weren't for his secret weapon--

267
00:11:04,722 --> 00:11:06,132
Dr. John Dorian.

268
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:07,372
-What?
- What?

269
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,090
You just said your name in a
weird kind of summing up way.

270
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,678
No, I didn't, Jake.

271
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,757
Oh, so you're Jake.

272
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:18,379
Uh, as I understand it, you just talked
my sister into ending her life.

273
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:19,581
Long story short.

274
00:11:19,755 --> 00:11:21,415
I'm a lawyer,
I'm suing you.

275
00:11:21,588 --> 00:11:22,485
Once again.

276
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,832
Sister dying,

277
00:11:23,867 --> 00:11:24,587
brother lawyer,

278
00:11:24,622 --> 00:11:25,827
suing you!

279
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:30,158
See, that's summing up
in a weird way.

280
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:31,611
Yeah.

281
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:33,737
"Brother lawyer..."
That's it.

282
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,308
I can't believe this is happening.

283
00:11:40,343 --> 00:11:42,227
Everything's gonna be fine.
You just trust me.

284
00:11:42,262 --> 00:11:43,028
Is that him?

285
00:11:43,063 --> 00:11:46,401
Yes. Here's Ted, our
brillant hospital attorney.

286
00:11:46,436 --> 00:11:47,524
Sharp as a tack.

287
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:51,617
Mark my word, Jake, we're gonna
take every last cent you have!

288
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:53,026
No, no, Ted.
We're on his side.

289
00:11:53,061 --> 00:11:56,177
Oh. Here's my card.

290
00:11:56,606 --> 00:11:57,994
This is a post-it.

291
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:01,243
I don't get real cards
until I win a case.

292
00:12:01,657 --> 00:12:03,266
Go take a nap, Ted.

293
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,707
He spelled "attorney" wrong.

294
00:12:06,471 --> 00:12:09,037
"Buy groceries,
kill self."

295
00:12:09,072 --> 00:12:11,191
Just admit it. You've been sent
from the future to destroy me.

296
00:12:11,226 --> 00:12:13,038
I am not from the future, Jake.

297
00:12:13,705 --> 00:12:15,134
Gesundheit, Carol.

298
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:17,438
Yes! It finally worked!
What are the odds?

299
00:12:17,473 --> 00:12:19,578
I don't know what the odds are, J.D.
What I do know

300
00:12:19,765 --> 00:12:21,359
is I'm about to go down to my truck,

301
00:12:21,394 --> 00:12:24,041
get my kyak paddle and go
Greg Barton on your ass.

302
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:24,894
Who's Greg Barton?

303
00:12:24,929 --> 00:12:26,094
He's a famous kayaker.

304
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:27,732
Oh, Greg Barton.

305
00:12:28,385 --> 00:12:30,070
I hate you, J.D.

306
00:12:30,105 --> 00:12:31,615
I know.

307
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:37,269
Dr. Cox, this is the most
painful thing I've ever done,

308
00:12:37,304 --> 00:12:39,315
and I was a cutter
for a week in high school.

309
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:43,468
My shop teacher thought scars were sexy,
but that's a... whole other story.

310
00:12:43,503 --> 00:12:45,235
The point is your advice really
worked with Jake

311
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:47,435
and I'd really apreciate if you
could give me some more help.

312
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,906
Oh, no problem Barbie.

313
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:53,184
Let me just finish writing this prescription,
and you'll be all squared away.

314
00:12:54,135 --> 00:12:56,122
This is a prescription for "no."

315
00:12:56,157 --> 00:12:56,932
Correctomundo.

316
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:59,886
It's to be taken with food every
saturday night while you're eating alone.

317
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:02,133
I don't think you understand
the severity of the situation here.

318
00:13:02,168 --> 00:13:05,080
I am dangerously close to
giving up men all together.

319
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:07,932
Then on behalf of men everywhere,
and I do mean everywhere

320
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:09,378
including the ones
in the little muds huts,

321
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,133
let me be the first to say
thanks and alleluia.

322
00:13:12,386 --> 00:13:15,506
Elliot, so you see the problem with
trying to appeal to its human side?

323
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:16,810
He doesn't have one.

324
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:19,433
Exactly.
But what does he have?

325
00:13:19,468 --> 00:13:22,557
A shaved chest, a closet full of tiny
T-shirts, and the eyes of a madman.

326
00:13:22,592 --> 00:13:24,340
Aohhhh, I'm sorry.

327
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,659
The correct answer she was
looking for is a giant ego.

328
00:13:27,694 --> 00:13:29,943
I have a giant ego.

329
00:13:29,978 --> 00:13:30,786
Damn it!
I knew that.

330
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:33,401
Would you just appeal to it so
I can go anf geta something to eat?

331
00:13:34,558 --> 00:13:36,269
You're amazing.

332
00:13:36,603 --> 00:13:37,848
And I mean.

333
00:13:44,717 --> 00:13:46,395
Dr Kelso, you can't do that.

334
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:50,005
I didn't.
Your friend Turkelton did.

335
00:13:50,355 --> 00:13:52,128
And I can do whatever I want.

336
00:13:54,283 --> 00:13:56,473
You look ridiculous.

337
00:13:58,976 --> 00:14:01,199
I thought we were doing
moustaches on sunday.

338
00:14:01,234 --> 00:14:02,742
I didn't do this.
Kelso did!

339
00:14:02,777 --> 00:14:04,635
You invited Kelso to moustache sunday?

340
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,625
Enough with the moustaches, dude.

341
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,583
Are you responsible for
breaking up Turner and Hooch?

342
00:14:08,618 --> 00:14:10,931
I needed an excuse to
get out of couples counselling.

343
00:14:11,355 --> 00:14:13,820
Dude, I can't open up, man.
I just can't do it.

344
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:16,091
Besides, this way no one gets hurt.

345
00:14:22,224 --> 00:14:24,184
We had a hell of a run, man.

346
00:14:24,741 --> 00:14:26,386
Just get out of here.

347
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:34,677
Maybe I should just go talk to him.

348
00:14:34,712 --> 00:14:36,996
Forget Dennis.
He's a horrible person. Ok?

349
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:40,269
We'll never be able to change his mind.
We need to focus on Betty, ok?

350
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,914
We'll just have her explain how
she feels. Problem's solved.

351
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:45,154
Betty's in a coma.
You know what?

352
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:48,545
I'm gonna talk to Dennis.
He seems like a reasonable guy.

353
00:14:50,828 --> 00:14:52,091
Hey, Jake.

354
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,233
How's it goin'?

355
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,871
Oh, I've had better days.
How are you?

356
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,431
Listen to me, Barbacious,
you gotta stay the course here.

357
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,857
You gotta keep ignoring him.

358
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:04,311
But I'm already ignoring him.
How do I ignore him more?

359
00:15:04,346 --> 00:15:05,344
Ah, piece of cake.

360
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:08,608
First you engage him,
then you ignore him.

361
00:15:08,812 --> 00:15:09,735
Elliot?

362
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,481
I said how are you.

363
00:15:11,516 --> 00:15:13,104
I actually don't have time for this, ok?

364
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:14,230
I'm a doctor.

365
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,618
But you asked me how I was.

366
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:18,581
Yeah, trying to save lives here.
It's not always about you.

367
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:23,011
Buddy, you would not believe
the day I'm having.

368
00:15:23,046 --> 00:15:24,378
Quiet, jackass.

369
00:15:24,413 --> 00:15:26,260
What did you say to Elliot
to make her run off like that?

370
00:15:26,295 --> 00:15:28,434
- 'Cause if you hurt her--
- I didn't say anything.

371
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,790
Everyone around here is crazy.

372
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:30,719
That's not true.

373
00:15:31,034 --> 00:15:33,727
Let me put down my bag of rats
and explain something to you.

374
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:36,146
A bag of rats?
Are those alive?

375
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:37,178
Most of 'em are.

376
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:38,249
I put a dead one in the middle.

377
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,987
That way all the live ones
get a good look at him...

378
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,521
they start toeing that line.

379
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:42,838
Know what I'm saying?

380
00:15:43,006 --> 00:15:44,834
I very much don't.

381
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:47,499
It's pretty simple.

382
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,511
Take a canvas bag...

383
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,983
Jailbreak!

384
00:15:56,114 --> 00:15:58,176
Look, you're gonna do whatever
you want with your sister,

385
00:15:58,211 --> 00:15:59,767
but Jake's just trying to help.

386
00:15:59,802 --> 00:16:02,742
He's a stand-up guy, and I think
you should leave him alone.

387
00:16:02,863 --> 00:16:05,500
If you do I think it will be dy-no-mite.

388
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,051
Sorry, I was just watching
Good times in the doctors lounge.

389
00:16:09,086 --> 00:16:12,159
Yeah. I'm gonna screw him to the wall.

390
00:16:13,913 --> 00:16:15,358
Can you believe this guy?

391
00:16:15,393 --> 00:16:18,006
Son, look around.

392
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:21,213
There's an oldld man with Alzheimer's
who no one bothers to come visit.

393
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:24,695
This morning I had a chat with a woman
who refuses to stop using cocaine,

394
00:16:24,696 --> 00:16:26,395
even though she's
6 months pregnant.

395
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,022
And just last week I saw an older woman
fall and break her hip

396
00:16:29,057 --> 00:16:31,622
because some guy was too busy
to hold the door open for her.

397
00:16:31,944 --> 00:16:33,938
Sir, you laughed and pointed
when she fell.

398
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:35,360
I didn't say it wasn't funny.

399
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,234
I just said it happened.
Come on.

400
00:16:37,235 --> 00:16:40,641
When's the last time you saw
a glimpse of humanity in this place?

401
00:16:41,224 --> 00:16:42,343
Kelso had a point.

402
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:43,630
I mean,
in the outside world,

403
00:16:43,631 --> 00:16:47,082
you'll occasionally see a stream of cars
drive by an old woman with a flat tire.

404
00:16:47,117 --> 00:16:48,310
But around here,

405
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:50,819
every time you round a corner, well...

406
00:16:51,335 --> 00:16:52,781
She fell again.

407
00:16:52,816 --> 00:16:54,784
Anyway, I knew what I had to do.

408
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,730
Just go, Jake.
No one here knows your last name.

409
00:16:57,765 --> 00:16:59,599
If anything happens,
they'll never be able to find you.

410
00:16:59,722 --> 00:17:02,079
Go enjoy your little
rafting thing in New Zealand.

411
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:05,769
Which, incidentally, is 10,000 miles
east of Australia and

412
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,227
famous for alcoholism
and clam chowder.

413
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:10,650
I've been brushing up on my New Zealand.

414
00:17:10,685 --> 00:17:12,758
You've been brushing up on New England.

415
00:17:13,154 --> 00:17:17,008
Well, go...anyway.
Wherever it is you're rafting.

416
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:19,771
Where's he going?

417
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,346
He's just left.

418
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:23,540
Barbie,

419
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,453
go get him, I...

420
00:17:25,989 --> 00:17:26,987
believe in you.

421
00:17:27,022 --> 00:17:28,128
No, you don't.

422
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:30,509
You just want me to go and embarrass
myself so you can laugh at me.

423
00:17:30,544 --> 00:17:33,907
Just like the time you told me the
hospital  fund raiser was a costume party.

424
00:17:34,268 --> 00:17:36,927
I walked into a black-tie dinner
dressed as Clarence Thomas....

425
00:17:37,084 --> 00:17:39,032
I was in a costume, too.

426
00:17:39,219 --> 00:17:41,688
You wore an Armani tux.

427
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,815
I went as someone who doesn't
make a fool out of himself.

428
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,528
How do you not get that?

429
00:17:49,877 --> 00:17:50,933
Thank you.

430
00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:54,521
I just got my sister into
the hospital across town,

431
00:17:54,522 --> 00:17:56,783
so I can finally get her
out this hell hole.

432
00:17:56,818 --> 00:17:58,434
Hey, I personally
see towards that

433
00:17:58,435 --> 00:18:01,713
every inch of this building is up to
the highest standards and codes.

434
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,395
Well, that's just bad timing.

435
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,582
Come back here!
I'm sorry!

436
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,522
Come on, fellas.

437
00:18:14,353 --> 00:18:16,732
And then something surprising happened.

438
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:20,460
Well, look who's back.

439
00:18:20,495 --> 00:18:22,088
Look, buddy, I--

440
00:18:22,338 --> 00:18:25,066
I barely know your sister,
and I certainly don't know you,

441
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:25,959
but like it or not,

442
00:18:26,008 --> 00:18:28,408
she told me what she wanted,
and I'm gonna honor that.

443
00:18:29,028 --> 00:18:31,876
Anyway, I'm gonna go ahead and
stay here till I can figure out a way

444
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,682
to make you understand that,
even if I have to get myself a lawyer.

445
00:18:36,006 --> 00:18:37,077
Not you.

446
00:18:39,492 --> 00:18:40,512
They're smart,

447
00:18:40,547 --> 00:18:42,057
they are organized,

448
00:18:42,092 --> 00:18:43,903
and they've got my keys.

449
00:18:45,681 --> 00:18:49,376
It's amazing how a selfless gesture
can affect so many people.

450
00:18:49,937 --> 00:18:52,512
One man saw someone who
didn't run away from a problem,

451
00:18:52,513 --> 00:18:54,245
and found the courage
to do the same.

452
00:18:54,656 --> 00:18:56,912
I got something I'd like to share today.

453
00:18:57,287 --> 00:18:59,161
- Really?
- Yeah.

454
00:18:59,282 --> 00:19:02,551
I don't like it when Carla pinches
my nipples when we're having sex.

455
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,530
Baby, that's--that's one of
the reasons why I cry,

456
00:19:05,531 --> 00:19:07,462
because you pinch
them too hard...

457
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:09,493
and it hurts.

458
00:19:09,801 --> 00:19:12,278
One man was pushed
to make the right decision.

459
00:19:12,313 --> 00:19:15,027
Just make her
as comfortable as possible.

460
00:19:17,787 --> 00:19:21,244
And another man realized it's ok
to be a decent human being for once.

461
00:19:22,586 --> 00:19:26,337
Well he's definitly leaving for good
this time there, Barbie. I'd...

462
00:19:26,504 --> 00:19:27,892
I'd say go for it.

463
00:19:27,927 --> 00:19:29,067
Why won't you leave me alone?

464
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,253
Oh, I don't know.

465
00:19:30,851 --> 00:19:32,597
Maybe because the NHL is on strike,

466
00:19:32,632 --> 00:19:35,851
and I'm not getting my fill of toothless
men knocking the hell out of each other.

467
00:19:35,886 --> 00:19:38,246
Or maybe because for the
first time in 4 years,

468
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:40,506
I'd actually like to see happy,
for a change.

469
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:43,123
Believe whatever you want.
I don't really care.

470
00:19:43,158 --> 00:19:46,816
Jake the Snake is bearing down and if
I were you, I'd step up to him,

471
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:50,103
look him straight in the eye
with those beautiful blues and...

472
00:19:51,761 --> 00:19:55,058
invite him out for a cup of cofee
before he escapes.

473
00:19:57,271 --> 00:20:01,274
Hey, can I buy you a cup of cofee
before you escape?

474
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:02,388
What now?

475
00:20:02,423 --> 00:20:04,149
I me--I mean go.

476
00:20:04,184 --> 00:20:06,286
Yeah. That'd be nice.

477
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:07,799
Great.

478
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,736
Ah, that's a cute couple.

479
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:13,445
I give 'em a week.

480
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:16,224
I can make sure of that.

481
00:20:16,844 --> 00:20:17,794
Rat?

482
00:20:17,996 --> 00:20:18,894
No, thanks.

483
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:21,566
Oh, congratulations, Clarissa.

484
00:20:22,392 --> 00:20:25,885
As for me, seeing Jake come back
and do the right thing

485
00:20:25,886 --> 00:20:27,790
restored my faith in humanity.

486
00:20:28,388 --> 00:20:35,924
I can't believe that 6 young men stopped
to help an old lady change a tire.

487
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:40,147
And don't you forget who put that tire on
and tightened those lugnuts, Martha.

488
00:20:40,182 --> 00:20:43,801
Ok, sweetie, have fun
at the swap-meet. Drive safe.

489
00:20:43,836 --> 00:20:47,366
Yeah, it sure feels good
to do the right thing.

490
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:55,082
Righty loosey, lefty tighty.

491
00:20:55,117 --> 00:20:58,577
Oh, righty tighty, lefty loosey.

492
00:20:58,612 --> 00:21:02,112
Oh men, it still felt good.

493
00:21:02,112 --> 00:21:03,178
