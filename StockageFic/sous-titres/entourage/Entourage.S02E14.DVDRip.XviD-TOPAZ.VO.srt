1
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,777
Hi.

2
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,287
What's with the girls?

3
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:32,916
It's a little pick-me-up
for Vince.

4
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,984
What better way
to get over a breakup

5
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,586
than a $1,500
wake-up call?

6
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,426
Come on, guys?
Hookers?

7
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,194
He needs to get out of bed,
not stay in it.

8
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,360
They're not hookers, E.
They're entrepreneurs.

9
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,302
Yeah, E,
don't be sexist.

10
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:45,895
These girls own
their own company.

11
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,964
It's called
"Breakfast In Bed."

12
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:51,443
One girl massages
while the other one feeds you.

13
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,672
And the other one
even reads to you.

14
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:54,543
They have
a nice selection of books, too.

15
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,412
And all the day's
periodicals.

16
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,677
Any sign of Vince?

17
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:00,277
No, but I heard
what sounded like weeping

18
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,015
coming from his room
this morning.

19
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,819
- Some day, huh?
- Why, what else?

20
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,122
I guess Ari's really done
at the agency.

21
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,128
Says here security
escorted him out.

22
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,789
Wow!

23
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,766
Oh, man, I hope this doesn't affect
my status over there.

24
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,430
I'm sure you're still their least
important client, Drama. Don't worry.

25
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,031
- Our world is crumbling.
- Yeah, might as well drink then, huh?

26
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,406
- How can you stay so calm?
- Ah, come on, guys, chin up.

27
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,809
If Vince ain't doing "Aquaman,"
you guys don't need to worry.

28
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,245
Vince is doing "Aquaman."
Believe me.

29
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,511
When he wakes up he'll realize
what he was saying was nuts.

30
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,642
Even Vince isn't that crazy.

31
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:33,515
Just in case he is,
don't worry.

32
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,544
- You guys are covered.
- Yeah, how?

33
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,283
Saigon's showcase.

34
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,814
This kid's gonna be a star.
Guaranteed.

35
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,054
Once he blows up,
we're on easy street.

36
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,758
- You better make that a double, Drama.
- I better call my agent.

37
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,330
- What's up?
- Mornin'.

38
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,337
- Yo.
- What's up, guys?

39
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,601
Hey, shouldn't you be
gettin' oiled up?

40
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,609
Uh, yeah, guys, I appreciate the gesture
but I sent the girls home.

41
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,578
- What?
- Vince, we prepaid that shit.

42
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:01,603
Hey, E, did you
track down Ari?

43
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,843
Yep.

44
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,884
Jesus.

45
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,116
Did you tell him
I'm not doing "Aquaman"?

46
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,522
- I can't find him.
- Well, you better go find him.

47
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,584
Vince, you're not quitting,
all right?

48
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,185
You start shooting
in three days.

49
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,696
Well, that's why
you better tell him soon.

50
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,460
I'm gonna go walk
on the beach.

51
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,627
I'm gonna end up living
back by the freeway.

52
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,069
All right, everybody
stop your fuckin' whining.

53
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:26,696
Drama,
stop your drinking,

54
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,299
'cause we gotta drive
one of these invites over to Dr. Dre.

55
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,435
- Let's go.
- Why do I have to stop drinking?

56
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,775
Last time I checked,
Mr. Rap mogul,

57
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,838
you were still a driver.

58
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,908
Yeah, hi.
Adam Davies' office, please.

59
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:42,388
Vince, can we
talk about this?

60
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,083
E, thanks.

61
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,591
I don't need to talk.
I need to walk.

62
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:50,118
Listen, Vince,
it hurts, I know.

63
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,596
I've been there,
all right?

64
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,758
You will get over Mandy.
This will pass.

65
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,768
Good.

66
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,703
So that's it?
Game over?

67
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,399
Yeah.

68
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,277
I thought we make
these decisions together.

69
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,074
No, not this one.

70
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,581
Please don't try and make
me feel guilty about it.

71
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,050
I'm not trying to make you feel guilty,
all right?

72
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,553
I'm just seriously concerned
about our future.

73
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,713
You don't understand.

74
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,188
I feel like
I got shot.

75
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:18,815
No, Vince,
you don't understand.

76
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,088
We may never get
an opportunity like this again.

77
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,061
Whose future are you
really concerned about?

78
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,189
- Ours or yours?
- Are you fuckin' serious?

79
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,199
Yeah. I am.
'Cause I'm not doing this movie.

80
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,599
And if you can't understand why,
you better think about

81
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,104
whether you want to be
a part of my future.

82
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:38,535
Eric, unless I spread a false rumor
that Mandy has genital warts,

83
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,046
there is no way for me
to spin this in Vincent's favor!

84
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,071
I can't hear you when
you're yelling at me.

85
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,346
- Just go work your magic.
- I'm a publicist,

86
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,910
not David Blaine.
Now what the fuck did you say to him?

87
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,684
- He doesn't listen to me.
- Then what's he pay you for?

88
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,281
Yeah, good question.

89
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,057
Hi.

90
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,531
I've been trying to get you
on the phone for 12 hours.

91
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,659
I want you and Vince
to know

92
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,070
everything is under control,
all right?

93
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:10,007
I am fully functional,
and I'm setting up my own shop.

94
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,443
That's great.
Mandy and Chris got back together.

95
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,413
- Jesus Christ.
- He wants off the movie.

96
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,938
I'm already having a bad day.
Come on!

97
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,450
You gotta call Cameron.

98
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,544
Don't go soft on me now. Come on,
we're at a life crossroads here.

99
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,919
- I've done all I can do.
- You've done all you can do?

100
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,424
What the fuck does that mean?
What, you want to quit too?

101
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,154
Actually, I think
I might, yeah.

102
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,958
E, the garbage man
who wins the lottery

103
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,931
does not
throw out the ticket.

104
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,592
You know what, fuck you.
Call Cameron.

105
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:35,726
Fuck you!
You call!

106
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,498
If you want to work with Vince again,
you'll call. It's that simple.

107
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:41,507
No one will want to work
with Vince if I call.

108
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,168
You think he was
cold three months ago?

109
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,109
After this, I won't be able
to put him in an ifilm.

110
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:48,307
You tell him that directly, okay?
I tried.

111
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,816
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll figure something out.

112
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,477
No, you won't.

113
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,145
'Cause you're fucked.

114
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,950
Do you even know
how fucked you are?

115
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,218
I mean, you are
so fucking fucked.

116
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,249
I think you're the most
fucked person I know.

117
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,491
Shit. Here comes the wife.
Just pretend like it's all good.

118
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,330
- You didn't tell your wife?
- No. When the time is right, yeah.

119
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,835
It's on the cover
of "Variety."

120
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,804
She doesn't read "Variety."
She reads "In Style."

121
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,602
- Hey, baby.
- Why aren't you at work?

122
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,098
- Uh, l-I overslept.
- Hey.

123
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,374
- So what's in the gym bag?
- Uh, it's a kilo of blow.

124
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:24,281
- What's with all the fucking questions?
- He's showing off for you.

125
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,515
Say goodbye to that Maserati.

126
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,617
I see a shiny new Vespa
in your future.

127
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,150
Good luck
in the Indy 500.

128
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,663
- Morning, E.
- Morning, Lloyd.

129
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,689
Don't say good morning
to him.

130
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,037
- Where to?
- Malibu. Pronto, Tonto.

131
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,801
Eric, you know
you guys are gonna make up.

132
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,865
Vince can't last
five minutes without you.

133
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,740
It's not even
about that.

134
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,042
- I'm almost 30 years old.
- You're not even 29.

135
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,073
Three weeks. And I'm an idiot
for putting myself in this position.

136
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,381
I'm pissed at Vince,
but I'm more pissed at myself

137
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,445
because it's nuts to tie
yourself to one guy,

138
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,012
especially a guy
you can't count on.

139
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,456
Eric, you could've never
predicted this happening.

140
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,722
Eighth grade he bailed on
the great adventure trip

141
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,456
to make ceramic frogs
with Jen Naidich.

142
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:13,192
- The handwriting was on the wall.
- He's your best friend.

143
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:16,599
That's a classic example of why you
shouldn't do business with your friends.

144
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,695
- So what are you going to do?
- I have no clue.

145
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,706
You know, Ari's right.
I'm so fucked.

146
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,731
You are not so fucked.

147
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,834
Eric, what I think
you should do is think about

148
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,777
finding a real job
in this business,

149
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,644
one with some stability.

150
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,546
Sloan,
I'm a college dropout.

151
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,915
Guys in the mailroom out here
have Wharton MBAs.

152
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,978
- You have experience.
- Not that anyone knows about.

153
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,320
I know some people
who know about it.

154
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:39,949
Maybe I can help.

155
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,693
Positivity, Drama.

156
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:46,698
You got to learn
to find positivity in every situation.

157
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,462
There is no positivity here,
Turtle, forget it.

158
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,800
Vince is imploding.

159
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,806
He needs to take on
a zen-like approach.

160
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,365
- It's all in the breathing.
- So what do we do?

161
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,606
- We gotta let him know he's fucking up.
- How?

162
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,340
Silent treatment.

163
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,645
- Good plan.
- Are you in or not?

164
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,584
I'm in.
I'm in.

165
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,712
This is it.

166
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,847
Dr. Dre gets
his hair cut here?

167
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,256
No, Dre don't leave the house
to get a haircut.

168
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,055
The stylist here
goes to him.

169
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,561
Since when do you
know stylists?

170
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,030
I don't.
I know a shampoo girl,

171
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,533
she knows the stylist,
she's gonna hook it all up.

172
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,933
Is that cool?
Anything else you need to know?

173
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,768
Adam Davies' office,
please.

174
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,740
Ari, you don't have
to sell me.

175
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,471
I'm not staying
with Terrance.

176
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,413
I'm a loyal guy.
So, where you go, I go.

177
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,279
That's great news,
Vinny.

178
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,547
That is great news, huh?
Give it up.

179
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,713
I love it.

180
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,916
You're still gonna act,
though, right?

181
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,356
You gonna bring up
"Aquaman" again?

182
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,826
I thought you said you weren't here
for that. I wouldn't have let you in.

183
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,523
That was before I knew that you
were with me. Now that I know,

184
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,759
back to business.
I'm representing, baby!

185
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,131
Give me a few weeks
and then we can talk about work.

186
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,932
Anyway, what did Cameron say?
Was he upset?

187
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,633
- Waiting for a call back.
- Just call him, Ari. Get it over with.

188
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,733
I will, Vinny.
Hear me out first. Please.

189
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,472
Maybe I should stay with Terrance,
'cause you obviously don't get me.

190
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,912
You think Terrance gets you?
When he hears about this,

191
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,779
you will never hear
from him again.

192
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,876
- I swear to God.
- So I'll find someone else.

193
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,854
You gonna find someone
to replace E?

194
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,413
- You gonna cut him loose too?
- E's just a little mad at me.

195
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,049
He'll get over it.
He always does.

196
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:23,027
I don't think so, man.
He sounded like he was pretty upset.

197
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,620
Sounded like
he's moving on.

198
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,632
- Yeah? Where to, Ari?
- Yeah.

199
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,830
I mean, it's sad to say,
but the guy's got no options.

200
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,566
Wow, Vinny,
heartbreak's made you cold, man.

201
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,198
Just make the call.

202
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,417
How'd it go?

203
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,551
How did the fucking
Bay of Pigs go, Lloyd?

204
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,432
Give me my bag,
Christy.

205
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,234
Thank you.

206
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,834
- What do you think you can do?
- Watch me.

207
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,777
You couldn't even keep me
out of "Variety."

208
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,804
There's no suppressing
the truth, Ari!

209
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,012
Vincent,
open the door!

210
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,213
Vincent!
Open the door!

211
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:24,449
I don't want to talk
about it anymore, Shauna.

212
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,618
Oh, come on, Vincent! Don't you dare
fuckin' walk away from me!

213
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,321
We need to talk!

214
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,126
- Fucking loser.
- Open the fucking door!

215
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,689
Look, baby,
I am here because I love you.

216
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,361
L-I know
how you're feeling.

217
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,428
L-I'm twice divorced, baby.
I know it is hell!

218
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,908
Don't make me kick this fucking
thing in! Open the fucking door!

219
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:46,503
- Shit! Fuck you, man!
- That's solid work, Shauna.

220
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,376
Oh, fuck you!
If you did your job right,

221
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,440
I wouldn't be out here
cleaning up your goddamn mess!

222
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:57,245
We all start out believing
that our clients care about us,

223
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,883
but in reality,
they don't.

224
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,587
There's only one way
to look at clients.

225
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,653
- How's that?
- Like stocks.

226
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,928
Invest without emotion.
Diversify.

227
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,027
I don't know that I could look
at someone that I work with like a 401k.

228
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,867
That's because you're
an idealist.

229
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,395
I could use
one of those.

230
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,944
Fuck Terrance.

231
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,504
Are you coming with me,
yes or no?

232
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,413
- Am I coming with you?
- Yeah.

233
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,577
Are you gonna put me in movies,
yes or no?

234
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,712
I put you in a movie...
"Ray."

235
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:30,551
Are you kidding me?
You were brilliant.

236
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,284
You didn't even see
the fucking thing.

237
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,519
- I see all my clients' movies, come on.
- Really?

238
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,755
- Who was I?
- You were the white guy, Richard.

239
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,764
- Making fun of me, Ari?
- I'm not making fun of you.

240
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,824
You tell me what you want,
let's make it happen.

241
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,132
I wanna be
in action movies.

242
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,196
I wanna be
the tough guy.

243
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:50,140
I wanna say "Cocksucking,
motherfucking cunt"

244
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:53,543
in a Scorcese movie
for once in my fucking life.

245
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,376
I wanna scare people.

246
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,405
You're scaring me,
Richard.

247
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,287
Are you gonna
deliver this, Ari?

248
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,449
- Are you with me or against me?
- Am I with you?

249
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,789
We're in a fucking
Coffee Bean here, Ari!

250
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,556
- Ari, excuse me.
- Not now, Lloyd.

251
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,189
- I'm in the middle of a meeting.
- It's really important.

252
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,223
Excuse me for one
second, Richard.

253
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,064
By the muffins.

254
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,765
I just got off the phone
with my mole at the agency.

255
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,238
Who are you?
Deep Throat?

256
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,798
E was just in there.
Terrance offered him a job.

257
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,367
As what?
His fucking pool boy?

258
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,379
As an agent, Ari.

259
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,445
- Give me your phone.
- I'm way over my minutes.

260
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,475
Give me your fucking phone!

261
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,417
Where you going, Richard?

262
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:39,447
- To use the bathroom, Ari.
- Give him a token, Lloyd.

263
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,452
Loving the new company.

264
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,102
- Talk to Cameron?
- Not yet.

265
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,135
- Don't call me till you do.
- Listen, Vinny! Vinny!

266
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,252
Did you guys eat
lunch yet?

267
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,950
I left four messages today
and three e-mails.

268
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,687
If Adam Davies is still my agent,
I want a call back!

269
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,422
I got Dre
at his hair salon;

270
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,396
Dash at the Kiehls store;

271
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,263
Just blaze at Nike town.
It's gonna be all good.

272
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,894
- Yeah, that's what I want to hear.
- That's what's up.

273
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,200
- A'ight, man. Peace.
- Later.

274
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,602
Yo, did you guys
eat lunch?

275
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,045
What the fuck?

276
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,888
- What the fuck, Ari?
- Vinny, listen to me.

277
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,823
E does have options.
Terrance offered him a job.

278
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,952
- As what?
- As an agent. He's gone.

279
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,395
He's gonna be living
with his rich girl in a big fat house.

280
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:55,798
And if you don't go back to work, you're
gonna be living in his guesthouse.

281
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,099
Fuck you, Ari.
Just call Cameron.

282
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,264
No go, Vinny.
You want that,

283
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,934
be a man,
you call him yourself.

284
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,409
You're fired, Ari.

285
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,742
Not the first time,
Vinny.

286
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:14,753
Did you guys hear something
about E getting a job offer?

287
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,552
Oh, okay, good.

288
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,862
All right, I get it!
You know what? Fuck you guys!

289
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:40,212
- What are you doing?
- Going for a drive.

290
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,146
You don't drive.

291
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,116
Fuck!

292
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,644
Are you okay?

293
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,418
Did you take a job
without talking to me?

294
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,551
Who told you that?

295
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,790
You know, of all people
to not get what I'm going through...

296
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,695
the heartbreak kid himself.

297
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,667
I mean, how many times
have I heard you cry like a little pussy

298
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,601
- over a girl?
- Not over a girl I barely know.

299
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,128
- Oh, so it's not real?
- You know, personally, Vince,

300
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:10,198
I think it's your ego.
Your big fuckin' movie star ego.

301
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,540
You could've had Mandy
thrown off this movie,

302
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,603
but you had to prove that
you could get her back.

303
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,377
You can't stand the fact that she
left you 'cause no one ever has.

304
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,884
But you know what?
I will leave you before you fuck me up.

305
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,150
Yeah, leave and do what?
Live off your girlfriend instead of me?

306
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:26,487
You ever think that Terrance
offered you the job to get to me?

307
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:29,050
Yeah, I did think that and that's why
I told him if I took the job,

308
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,654
it'd meant I'd never work
with you again, and he still offered it.

309
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,393
- Don't be here when I get back.
- Like I fuckin' would be!

310
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,370
This is fuckin' nuts, E.

311
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,635
- Where you gonna go?
- Sloan's.

312
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,939
Is it too much to ask for a fucking
call back from one's own agent?

313
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,274
I think not!

314
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,712
You tell Davies
he will call me back

315
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:52,239
or he will see me
at the office for a face to face!

316
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,781
Are you still gonna come
to Saigon's showcase tonight?

317
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,589
You know it.
He's gonna kill.

318
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,061
See you, Drama.

319
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,757
Later, E.

320
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,194
You told Vince
about Terrance?

321
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,788
One last shot,
Eric.

322
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,528
I thought the threat
of losing you might wake this kid up.

323
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,661
Yeah, well, it didn't.
He threw me out of the house.

324
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,000
- He fired me.
- Really?

325
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:49,098
Yeah, listen,
let's get together.

326
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,041
- I need to talk to you.
- Forget it, Ari.

327
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,772
The next time you see me,
we'll be fighting over clients.

328
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:57,441
One last chat, Eric,
at our old stomping grounds.

329
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,381
Johnny,
he's in a meeting!

330
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,723
Are you seriously
not gonna call me back?

331
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,251
Look what the breeze
just blew in.

332
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,229
Shut the fuck up, Paulie,
I'm not in the mood.

333
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,095
Sorry, Johnny.
It's a busy day.

334
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,566
Are you my agent
or not?

335
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,031
You were a family deal,
Johnny.

336
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:25,305
If Vince isn't a client,
I'm afraid you're not a client.

337
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,574
Karma is a bitch!

338
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,674
Come on, not here,
Drama!

339
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,345
Come on, we're in
a fucking meeting, man.

340
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,287
You promised me something
out of this deal.

341
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,950
You're taking his TV?
What are you a fucking...

342
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,256
"Surreal Life" cast member?
You freak.

343
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,319
What a putz.

344
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:47,855
- I'll see you on the outside.
- Get a life, loser boy!

345
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,598
We had some good
battles here, huh, E?

346
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,505
Yeah.
This could be the last one.

347
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,977
No more battles. Look at this.
See me waving the flag?

348
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,447
- What are we doing here?
- What, two friends can't have dinner?

349
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:06,383
What, we're not friends?
Huh?

350
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,943
- I'm thinking.
- I'm gonna tell you something.

351
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:12,047
Vince is the only client
I've ever had

352
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,991
that I considered a friend.

353
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,426
All right, the only one
I really cared about.

354
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,430
I mean Jessica Biel too,

355
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:21,627
but you know I cared about her
for very different reasons.

356
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,430
I appreciate that.

357
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,664
Do you appreciate
the friendship you and Vince have?

358
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,865
'Cause there aren't too many people
your age who have

359
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,635
a lifelong friendship like that.

360
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:33,076
I can't tell you what one person that I
went to high school with is doing.

361
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,637
What's the point?
I know you're getting at something here.

362
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,206
You told Vinny
not to fuck up.

363
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,219
He fucked up.
You feel betrayed, you feel hurt.

364
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,517
You think that what
he did was selfish.

365
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,819
- You're telling me it wasn't?
- I'm telling you

366
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,689
he's not thinking rationally.

367
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,956
'Cause when he wakes up
in a week or a month

368
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,963
or three months from now,
and he realizes

369
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:55,592
that he fucked
his whole life up,

370
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,761
you're gonna need
to be there,

371
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,203
'cause he's gonna have
no one else.

372
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,637
Wow, I'm impressed,
Ari.

373
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,736
A totally selfless meal.

374
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:11,044
Well, you're buying
'cause you've got a goddamn job.

375
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:18,316
You ready?

376
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,552
Look at this place,
it's set to pop.

377
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:24,323
There's not one big player
in this motherfucker, man.

378
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,660
Not one.

379
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,995
There's Snoop's Dawg
right here.

380
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,297
Yo, Z.
Where Snoop at?

381
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,303
Yo, what up, man?
He ain't makin' it, though.

382
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,305
But I'm here to represent.
What's up, man?

383
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,806
What up?

384
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,138
It's all good,
a'ight?

385
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,269
You're going on soon,
so get yourself ready.

386
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,745
- Trust me.
- A'ight.

387
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,579
I'm so fucked!

388
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,914
They sent
all their assistants.

389
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,579
No Dre, no Dash.
No nothin'.

390
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,351
Turtle, I got no career,
no representation and no hope,

391
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,018
so stop
your fuckin' crying.

392
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,254
The CEOs might not be here,

393
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,354
but there's a lot
of people here.

394
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,262
You did a good job,
Turtle.

395
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,766
Thanks, Drama.

396
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,529
And look who did show.

397
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,796
This is pretty exciting.

398
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,404
All right,
you know what?

399
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:16,881
If you're not gonna talk to me,
I'm gonna go.

400
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,473
If we're gonna
talk to you, bro,

401
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,178
we're gonna tell you
how we feel.

402
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,687
Tell me tomorrow.
Tonight's Turtle's night.

403
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,053
Thanks for coming, Vin.

404
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,419
Hey, we love you,
Vince.

405
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,294
Any word from E?

406
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,629
Right here,
movie star.

407
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,362
Shouldn't you be at some
agency function or something?

408
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,393
I'm here for Turtle.
I'm not here to fight with you.

409
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,167
Can I have a beer?

410
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,142
So, E, I said some things.

411
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:48,044
Yeah, I said some things too.
Let's leave it at that.

412
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,638
Okay.

413
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,309
I mean, you should know
I called Cameron.

414
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,549
- Yeah? What did he say?
- I'm meeting him tomorrow.

415
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,556
I figured I should
talk to him face to face.

416
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,457
Yeah, it's the right thing to do.
I'll go with you.

417
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,484
You gonna try
and talk me out of it again?

418
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,519
Nope.
Done doing that.

419
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,562
So are you going
as my manager?

420
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,731
No. I'm going
as your friend.

421
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,105
Yeah yeah, what's up,
y'all?

422
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:20,373
Let's get it right.
Come on, come on.

423
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,039
Let's get it poppin'
up in here.

424
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,911
Yeah!

425
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,179
Rock with me.

426
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:29,551
Put your hands in the air,
back and forth! Yeah!

427
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,183
Hey, Aquaman himself.

428
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,852
Let's go.

429
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,885
So are you ready for
the ride of your life?

430
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,396
Yeah.

431
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,262
Gotta be careful
what you wish for.

432
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,994
- So are you good, huh?
- Uh...

433
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,332
I am so pumped
about this.

434
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,032
I feel it, and when I feel it,
you know it's gonna be good.

435
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,769
I haven't had this kind of connection
between the actor and the role

436
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,640
since I set Arnold
in "Terminator."

437
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,339
The thing about Aquaman
is there's a vulnerability to him

438
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,938
which you're
gonna be perfect for.

439
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:31,642
Aquaman is the voice
of the ocean.

440
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,947
So you're really gonna
take the job, E?

441
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,976
Of course he's gonna
take the job.

442
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,216
I can already see
his future.

443
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,690
He's gonna move in with Sloan,
drive her daddy's Bentley,

444
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,354
and join a country club
that restricts us.

445
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,793
I'm gonna get some air.

446
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,858
This is you defending
the underwater city.

447
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,733
And we're gonna do it
all dry for wet,

448
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,739
so you'll be hanging
on wires.

449
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,298
You won't really be underwater.
You're gonna love that.

450
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:00,368
Actually, it's terrible,
but it's only for the first month.

451
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:03,279
And, you know,

452
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:06,079
I'm into this, okay?

453
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,745
Uh, sorry, I'm going on.

454
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:11,381
You called me.
What is it you want to talk about?

455
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,618
Uh, yeah.

456
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,956
Jim...

457
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,588
this is gonna be tough.

458
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:22,191
- I'm not taking the job.
- Come on, what are you crazy?

459
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,998
- Or stupid?
- Vince pulled me out of a pizza place.

460
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:27,004
Besides,
I'm not even 29 years old.

461
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,596
I'm not wearing a suit
to work every day.

462
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,164
So we're all fucked.

463
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,768
Yeah, well at least
we're all fucked together.

464
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:36,474
Well, here he is.
It's over, so be supportive.

465
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,039
All right.

466
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:43,781
- How'd it go?
- It went.

467
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,594
- What did that mean?
- What did he say?

468
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:50,993
Did he go crazy?

469
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,656
He didn't threaten
you, did he?

470
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:55,564
- No.
- You didn't do it, did you?

471
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,091
Yeah, I'm right.
I can tell by the look on your face.

472
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,104
You didn't quit.

473
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:03,073
All right, look, E. I know you put
this whole thing together,

474
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,269
but I'm the one who's
gotta work with her every day.

475
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,937
I didn't think
I could do that.

476
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:09,003
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, I understand.

477
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,413
What do you think
I'm doing here?

478
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,350
But did you quit
the movie or not?

479
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:16,047
No.
I couldn't do it.

480
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,748
You were right.

481
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,257
- Oh, yeah, bro!
- But I was ready to, though.

482
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,886
I sat there and I looked Cameron
right in the eyes.

483
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,419
Then I thought about my boys.
I couldn't let you down.

484
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,954
- Yeah, right.
- Bullshit, bro.

485
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:29,159
- You were scared of Cameron!
- A little bit.

486
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,169
He already had
these made.

487
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,763
Aw, Christ, look at
the man-gina on this guy.

488
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,999
Oh, my God!

489
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,200
The silent treatment
was good, guys.

490
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,573
But you should've heard this guy
yelling at me yesterday.

491
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,907
Nobody's yelled at me
like that in years.

492
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,413
- Really?
- Yeah? How'd it feel?

493
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:45,211
It felt good.
It felt like home.

494
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,343
So what, are we back
in business?

495
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:50,183
I don't know. Can you promise me
this will never happen again?

496
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,520
First love
only happens once, E.

497
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:54,422
Twice for me, bro.

498
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,825
Both broads
