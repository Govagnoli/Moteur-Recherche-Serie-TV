1
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,393
There is nothing more important to a man

2
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,317
than his family.

3
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,399
These men,
these men of honour,

4
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,193
they too are my family.

5
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,993
La Famiglia Corleone.

6
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,596
I now invite you
to be reborn as one of us.

7
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,631
Thanks, bro.

8
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,831
You are now one
of our qualified men.

9
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,553
Good for you, kid.

10
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,915
Look at this kid.

11
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,316
This is the closest you'll come
to working with an Academy Award winner.

12
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,477
Nice try, Turtle. So the three episodes
of A Different World

13
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,751
I did with Marisa Tomei
were a figment of my imagination?

14
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,633
Lmagine getting off this game.

15
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,275
Hold on, E, let me ask the Boss
of All Bosses if I can roll with you.

16
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,118
Even Capone takes a night off
to hang out with his boys.

17
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,039
Yeah, you're right.
Hang on, let me get my jacket.

18
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,911
There you go.

19
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,311
Ari hasn't called me all day.

20
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,430
He's been your agent 24 hours, relax.

21
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,675
Don't feel bad. He hasn't called me either.

22
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,598
And I told the president of Warner's
to fuck himself last night.

23
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,790
He'll call when he has something to tell you.

24
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,558
Can we not talk business tonight?

25
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,319
This is a hang-loose,
get-fucked-up, guys' night out.

26
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,113
That's what it's gonna be.
Just the four of us.

27
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,478
How are you?

28
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,033
Hi, guys.

29
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,788
You can't have a fun guys' night out with me?

30
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,671
We love you, Sloan,
you know that.

31
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,836
But... it's the law.

32
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,997
You don't invite your girl
on a boys' night out.

33
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,715
OK, in fairness to E, he had no idea
I was gonna be here tonight.

34
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,955
Pull this leg and it plays Jingle Bells.

35
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,271
I'm serious. My girlfriend from DC
is meeting me here.

36
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,311
Yeah? What does she look like?

37
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,669
It's guys' night out. Don't worry about that.

38
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,632
Touché.

39
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,598
- Dibs.
- That's not her.

40
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,152
Do you remember me?
You bought me a birthday drink.

41
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,997
Vodka tonic and 25, right?

42
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,634
How about I return
the favour and buy you one?

43
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,274
Absolutely. Come sit, join us.

44
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,754
What's next? You got a girl coming too?

45
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,593
It's Ari.

46
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,557
- How was dinner with Alan?
- Ask him if he found me a job yet.

47
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,239
Dinner was great.
Tell Drama he's on my to-do list

48
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,555
right after inserting needles in my cock.

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,070
Put Vince on. I got news
and I don't want you taking the credit for it.

50
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,838
Vince is busy, Ari. Talk.

51
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,836
Alan felt so bad about last night

52
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,997
he wants to bump Vince up
to $10 million for A2.

53
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,270
Alan's moving up to 10,
what do you think?

54
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,675
- The number's 20.
- We're holding at 20.

55
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,676
- Put Vince on.
- He wants to talk to you.

56
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,029
Tell him Alan's a liar,
and I don't deal with liars.

57
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,548
Let's go to the bar
so we don't have to wait for the waitress.

58
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,115
We can always go to my place
so we don't have to wait for a bartender.

59
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,350
We'll catch you guys later.

60
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,879
- Tell him.
- He wants you...

61
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,876
I heard him. Put him on the phone, E.

62
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,114
He's gone, Ari.

63
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,197
We do not want to get
on Alan Gray's bad side.

64
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,516
- What do you want me to tell you?
- Put him on the phone, you dick!

65
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,313
- You don't want me on your bad side.
- What are you gonna do?

66
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,429
This.

67
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,755
He didn't want to talk to me?

68
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,917
- This night is a disaster.
- All of a sudden we're on E's date.

69
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,713
- You wanna blow out?
- Yeah, come on.

70
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,399
- You guys are leaving?
- Yeah.

71
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,080
- Oh, my God. Hi, Tori!
- Hi, baby.

72
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,430
Maybe it will salvage
this night after all.

73
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,948
Hi, it's Johnny Drama.
Nice to meet you.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,911
Tori. Nice to meet you.

75
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,678
- The girl was cold.
- Ice cold.

76
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,950
Why, because you guys
couldn't close?

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,629
She said she doesn't date.
Brad Pitt couldn't close her.

78
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,194
Did you hear what she said
when I offered to buy her a drink?

79
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,832
- No, what?
- "No, thank you."

80
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,154
What a bitch.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,468
All right, guys.
This is Sloan, so stop.

82
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,239
- Didn't we just see her?
- How whipped is this guy?

83
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,191
- Hey, babe.
- Hi, babe.

84
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,435
You guys sound drunk.

85
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,152
You weren't drunk when I left.

86
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,430
- We're having a good time now.
- Good.

87
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,754
Tell him.

88
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,360
Tori wants me to tell you

89
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,550
that it was really nice meeting you.

90
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,716
Tell her it was
nice meeting her too.

91
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,830
And she thinks you're really cute.

92
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,270
- Cute? That's cool.
- Who's cute?

93
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,470
- Tell him the other thing.
- No.

94
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,829
Yes! Here, I'll tell him.
I'll tell him.

95
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,519
- OK, wait.
- Does she think one of us is cute?

96
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,150
Tori wants me to tell you
that she wants to have a threesome

97
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,872
with me and you.

98
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,638
Sleep on that, E.

99
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,433
OK, we gotta go.
I love you. Bye, babe.

100
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,069
- What's up?
- She like one of us or not?

101
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,793
- I thought you guys didn't like her.
- I loved her.

102
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,594
Yeah, me too. She's smokin'.
So who'd she say was cute?

103
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,194
- Me.
- You?

104
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,356
Why would she tell Sloan you're cute?

105
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,755
They're drunk. She wants a threesome.

106
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,392
So why aren't you in your car?

107
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,477
- Cos it's a joke.
- No woman should ever joke about that!

108
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,033
No, they should not.

109
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,878
I'm so whackin' off
to your girlfriend tonight.

110
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,434
- Loser.
- I was gonna whack off to Vince's girl.

111
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,959
But this tops that.

112
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,955
- Hello.
- Hey, Johnny, I have Ari for Vince.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,831
Vince is sleeping. I'll talk to Ari.

114
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,269
Vince isn't available,
but I have Drama.

115
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,595
I don't wanna talk to Drama.
I want Vince.

116
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,155
- Sorry, I don't have Ari any more.
- You just had him for Vince.

117
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,714
You told me Vince was sleeping
and now I lost him.

118
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,991
Tell Vince to call Ari when
he wakes up and I'll have him again.

119
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,716
- Vince just walked in. You got Ari now?
- I have Vince now.

120
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,034
I have Ari.

121
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,232
Can I say that you won't talk to Ari
unless he talks to me?

122
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,674
Here's Johnny.

123
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,032
- Yeah.
- What do you need?

124
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,435
- I need a job, Ari.
- I'll see what I can do.

125
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,119
- Do better than that.
- How?

126
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,958
- Promise you'll see what you can do.
- Drama...

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,514
Promise, or I'm not gonna put Vince on.

128
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,553
I promise
I will do all I can for you.

129
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,952
Sorry, I had him but now I don't.

130
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,115
Ari left three messages on my cell.

131
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,391
Yeah. He's probably
freakin' about making the Warner's call.

132
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,557
Can you imagine the look on Alan's face
when Ari says no to 10?

133
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,591
Don't fuck with
the boys from PS 154.

134
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,757
Speaking of fucking,
did he tell you what Sloan said?

135
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,028
No, what'd she say?

136
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,469
Why did I think you would forget about that?

137
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,432
- I was thinking about it all night.
- Like you weren't.

138
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,879
What'd she say?

139
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,276
Sloan and Tori want E to be the meat
in their girl-girl sandwich.

140
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,912
No! Is it true?

141
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,076
- What do you think?
- You'd enjoy it.

142
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,394
Sloan'd do that?

143
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,750
I have a little theory
that all women love other women.

144
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,677
Probably because I love all women.

145
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,711
She was drunk and it will never happen.

146
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,548
Drunk or not, she wouldn't have
put it out there if it wasn't a possibility.

147
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,034
Exactly. You might have
to push her a little.

148
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,311
Yeah, E, are you man enough to push?

149
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,230
- I'm man enough to leave.
- Off to see Sloan?

150
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,952
I wonder what you'll talk about!

151
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,594
- See you guys later.
- Take this seriously.

152
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,632
When opportunity knocks,
let her the fuck in.

153
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,070
And for God's sakes,
let her go down on your girlfriend!

154
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,674
Yes, Alan, yes, listen.
You've been more than generous.

155
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,314
You know actors.
Crazy comes with the territory.

156
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,195
I understand, Ari. But if this nonsense
continues much longer I might get mad.

157
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,630
Believe me, Alan, I more than anyone
do not want to get you mad.

158
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,353
I have seen you
on the racquetball court.

159
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,230
I know that franchises do not grow on trees.

160
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,352
I will call Vince myself
and tell him how mad I will be

161
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,038
if he tries to pull a Chappelle.

162
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,029
I like your new attitude, Ari. You shoulda
moved to a boutique agency years ago.

163
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,799
- Thank you, sir.
- Anyway...

164
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,992
I'm willing to go up to $12.5 million
to wrap this up.

165
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,268
12 and a half?

166
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,952
But, Ari, wrapped up means
you call me... today by 4:00.

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,232
- Lloyd, get Vince on the phone!
- Give me the only answer that I want.

168
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,399
Consider it done.

169
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,550
It better be.

170
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,119
Lloyd! Do you have Vince?

171
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,718
No, I have Drama

172
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,194
who says that he's been
authorised to tell you

173
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,391
that Vince will not speak to you
until he, Drama, has a job.

174
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,192
- Really?
- Really.

175
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,671
Question.
No lox at staff meetings now, Ari?

176
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,918
Cost cutting until we get into the new offices.
There will be lox in the new year.

177
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,679
Until then, enjoy the gourmet chicken salad.

178
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,235
Anyway, people,
staff meeting has been cancelled.

179
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,396
You all have one goal today.

180
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,355
To get Vincent Chase's brother
Johnny Chase a job. Any job.

181
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,595
I don't care if it's a porn shoot

182
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,950
in which he is being gang-raped
by silverback apes.

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,276
If there are cameras rolling,
everybody wins.

184
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,835
Ten grand to anyone
that can deliver this to me today.

185
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,749
- Can I vie for the ten grand prize?
- Sure, but you'll get paid in yen.

186
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,995
Now try E one more fucking time.

187
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,598
There's another email.

188
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,909
What does it say?

189
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,032
"You drunken, Irish, short, midget cocksucker.

190
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,832
"I need someone to call me back."

191
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,713
- He sounds angry.
- Yeah.

192
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,274
- So what are you gonna do?
- Nothing to do.

193
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,155
Vince is a man of principle. He was lied to.
It's not about the money, so...

194
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,430
- So.
- So.

195
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,950
So what else?

196
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,672
What else?
How are you feeling?

197
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,312
I'm OK, why?

198
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,397
- You guys were hammered last night.
- We weren't that bad.

199
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,998
You weren't?

200
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,759
Is there something you'd like to say?

201
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,199
- We were joking.
- That's a mean joke.

202
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,118
- You shouldn't tease a guy like that.
- Like you'd do it.

203
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,594
I'd do it. If you were OK with it.

204
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,552
I mean who wouldn't do it?
Why wouldn't I do it?

205
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,113
If you were OK with it.

206
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,076
- Have you ever done anything like that?
- No. Have you?

207
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,712
What do you think?

208
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,040
I think, no. And I don't think you ever would.

209
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,833
- Are you challenging me?
- I'm not saying it in a bad way.

210
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,836
I just don't think you would.

211
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,478
I would. With you, once.

212
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,237
Once would be great.

213
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,718
And I'd have some rules.

214
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,036
No, no, no, no, no. No rules.

215
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,435
- Call it off.
- That's what I'm gonna do.

216
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,233
A threesome with rules
is a nightmare.

217
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,636
I don't know why I told you.
It's between me and my girlfriend.

218
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,070
No, it's between you, your girlfriend
and a complete stranger.

219
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,998
Your best friends
might have wisdom to impart.

220
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,429
The only threesome you've had
involved each other.

221
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,471
I don't want that wisdom imparted.

222
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,511
- Vince, talk to him.
- What's the rule?

223
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,632
- What's the difference?
- You can't have sex with Tori.

224
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,399
- How'd you know?
- Lucky guess.

225
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,556
I thought we were going to Book Soup.

226
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,875
- That was a ruse.
- This is gonna happen.

227
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,751
We gotta get you prepared, baby.

228
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,714
- Grab a basket.
- What, are we in Pathmark?

229
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,070
- Alan's on one.
- It's only 3:30.

230
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,112
- I have 3:32.
- I'm supposed to have until 4:00.

231
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,550
Tell him you are looking for me
and you will find me soon.

232
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,079
You are quite sure of it. Go.

233
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,998
And then you get E
and Vince on the phone now.

234
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,551
- Seriously, how did you know?
- Sloan's a good girl.

235
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,309
- This is just experimental.
- More selfish than anything.

236
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,918
How is it selfish, Drama?

237
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,632
She gets the whole experience.

238
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,989
You get to play the first half,
then you gotta hit the bench.

239
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,237
- It is bullshit.
- No, guys. This is a good thing.

240
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,556
I've had threesomes where both girls
wanna watch me with the other,

241
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,354
and threesomes where I have one girl
I need to be more protective of.

242
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,914
The girl you have
to be more protective of

243
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,269
is the girl you want a relationship with.

244
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,880
Not the girl begging you
to bang her best friend.

245
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,639
Look, Sloan's a good girl.
You'll have a good time.

246
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,148
Make sure she knows she's in first position.

247
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,031
And definitely get one of these.

248
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,640
There's no rule Sloan can't fuck her!

249
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,075
- Would you turn that fucking ringer off?
- How long can we ignore him?

250
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,395
I'll take it. Hello.

251
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,830
I'm workin' on stuff, Drama.
I'll get back to you.

252
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,911
Anyone make any progress
getting Johnny Chase a job?

253
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,030
I've got some calls in.

254
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,959
Any agents in the building
have any calls in?

255
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,470
Somebody better do fucking something
or tomorrow

256
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,353
you will be working for fucking Lloyd!

257
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,199
Ari Gold's office.

258
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,032
12.5 million and no one
will talk to me!

259
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,435
Nobody will talk to me?

260
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,755
It's Alan. I think he'll talk to you.

261
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,758
Ari! That's a rental!
That's a rental!

262
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,075
No, can't do...!

263
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,839
Alan, how are you?

264
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,873
Well, it's 4:02 and I'm making
my own calls. How do I sound?

265
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,831
Do you have the answer that I want?

266
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,075
I'm just trying to locate Vince.

267
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,634
- Let me ask you a question, Ari.
- Yeah.

268
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,514
What are you gonna do
when you can't locate me?

269
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,120
What are you gonna do
when I shut this place down

270
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,116
to you and everyone you know?

271
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,196
How will you explain to your clients

272
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,994
that one of the largest studios in the world
no longer exists?

273
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,872
I wouldn't like that, Alan.

274
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,911
Let me propose something to you, Ari.

275
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,871
Something you can present to that...

276
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,514
pretty boy client of yours,
if you find him.

277
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,551
I'm listening.

278
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,397
I'm quite sure you are.

279
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,351
- Look at this guy.
- Fancy.

280
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,233
- Are you going to your senior prom?
- Fuck off.

281
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,840
- The maitre d' from Dakota called to confirm.
- Dakota?

282
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,634
Leave it to this guy
to wine and dine a threesome.

283
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,798
It's from my private reserve.
In case you have a problem getting it started.

284
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,833
I know you're not a big porn guy,
but DVD innovations are amazing.

285
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,632
Remember when you'd be tuggin' it

286
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,433
and they'd cut to the guy's face
and you wanted to kill yourself?

287
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,596
Never again. Multi-angles.

288
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,791
- Good tip, Turtle.
- Turtle, grab a picture.

289
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,434
This is before.
You better bring home the after.

290
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,676
- You got the girls picking you up?
- What, no limo, E?

291
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,034
- This must be serious. He brought his muscle.
- Hey, Johnny, go deal.

292
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,310
You better go. The girls are waiting.

293
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,157
I'm not going anywhere.

294
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,476
Don't be nervous.
You're just doing it twice.

295
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,238
I'm not abandoning you with Ari.

296
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,078
Unless Alan came up to 20,
there's not much to talk about.

297
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,509
- Go ahead, have a good time.
- For all of us.

298
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,030
- You sure?
- E, you better go or I will.

299
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,673
Lose the jacket.

300
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,517
You think?

301
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,439
- You got something for me, Ari?
- I don't have a job.

302
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,632
- Then I can't let you pass.
- Even if I got you a good audition?

303
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,479
- Even if Lloyd did?
- What do you got?

304
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,159
- A pilot Eddie Burns is producing.
- Eddie Burns?

305
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,395
I played ball with Eddie Burns. He loves me.

306
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,590
It's four young Irish boys in New York.

307
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,712
- I'm Irish from New York.
- And you were once young.

308
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,036
- It's the older brother.
- This sounds perfect.

309
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,832
If you book it I get 10,000 bucks.

310
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,791
Yen, 10,000 yen. Can I come in?

311
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,874
Not so fast.
You handed me off to Lloyd.

312
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,434
One day, one audition.
Complain tomorrow.

313
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,631
- Later, Ari.
- E, Vince better not be in that car!

314
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,830
I'm right here, Ari.

315
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,112
Bear with me, Lloyd,
I wanna hear your big-picture strategy.

316
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,593
I'm listening, what's up?

317
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,872
I just would like to ask you
if you have a plan here, you know?

318
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,797
If you do, I would love to hear it.

319
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,434
- A plan?
- A plan for what you want.

320
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,189
If Alan offered you $20 million,
would that make you happy?

321
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,629
- It's not about the money.
- What is it, then?

322
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,240
I want the days he promised.
I wanna do Medellin.

323
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,556
And if he does that,
I will do Aquaman 2 for free.

324
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,238
- It's not...
- I swear to God.

325
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,316
It's not gonna happen, Vince.

326
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,432
Medellin is done.
They made an offer to Benicio.

327
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,477
Alan owns your ass.

328
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,037
He fucked me, Ari. To my face.

329
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,548
I'm sorry he lied.
This is the world we live in.

330
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,354
He also offered you
$12.5 million in compensation.

331
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,914
He didn't have to do that.
You have to stop this.

332
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,919
All right?
Because if you don't, he will sue you.

333
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,393
He will take everything.

334
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,079
He'll take the house,
the cars, maybe even Turtle.

335
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,873
I don't care about any of that,
except Turtle.

336
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,639
- Thanks, Vince.
- It's over, I'm sorry.

337
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,477
You have no other choice.

338
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,272
Do you understand?

339
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,551
- Yes, I understand.
- Good.

340
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,229
Tomorrow, breakfast on the lot,
we make amends.

341
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,788
I'm not going to breakfast.

342
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,717
Alan wants to look you in the face

343
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,513
and you to tell him
you're gonna honour the contract.

344
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,597
- No more grief, we move on.
- Ari, listen to me.

345
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,676
I'm not going to any fucking breakfast.

346
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,075
You can tell Alan
I will show up every day

347
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,076
and bust my ass like I've always done.

348
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,398
But I don't want the 12.5 million.
I want the seven that we agreed upon.

349
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,910
- I won't be indebted to a douchebag.
- He has other movies.

350
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,475
I don't care!
I'll never work with him again anyway.

351
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,478
I don't care if he offers me a billion.
Do you understand?

352
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,633
I'm done.

353
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,677
Kid's got principles.

354
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,234
Where's the fucking manager
when I need him?

355
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,633
Your parents must be happy
having you home for the weekend.

356
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,275
- They're not around any more.
- I'm sorry, that's horrible.

357
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,880
Baby, they're not dead.
They retired to Flagstaff.

358
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,751
That's cool.

359
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,391
- It's so cute how nervous he is.
- Nervous? I'm not nervous.

360
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,998
It's OK, you don't have to be.

361
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,110
OK, Tori, you're freaking him out.

362
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,470
- And you're so calm, Sloan?
- You're both nervous.

363
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,159
And it's cute.

364
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,958
We're gonna need to get drunk.

365
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,877
- Definitely.
- Yes.

366
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,035
Cheers.

367
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,710
I'm just kidding.

368
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,238
Ari, look, we're all very happy
that Vince finally came to his senses.

369
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,077
How did you talk him off the ledge?

370
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,795
It was simple, Dana. I told him
he would have to fuck you if he didn't.

371
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,149
- You're such an asshole.
- There he is.

372
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,431
- How are you, Alan?
- Where's your client, Ari?

373
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,393
We're all good.
Listen, it's a done deal.

374
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,389
Vince feels so bad about this he said
forget about the 12.5, he'll do it for the 10.

375
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,796
- But he wouldn't come to breakfast with me?
- No, it's not that.

376
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,990
Fucking actors think
they have all the power.

377
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,634
- Alan, Vince is a good kid.
- Fuck Vince, Ari.

378
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,591
And fuck you.

379
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,672
OK, then.

380
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,399
Yeah, Ari, what's the problem?

381
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,796
I needed you last night
to talk some sense into Vince.

382
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,956
Vince told me
everything was under control.

383
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,118
- You told him to skip that breakfast?
- Vince didn't tell me about any breakfast.

384
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,789
- Alan wanted one, Vince wouldn't go.
- Jesus. You know what?

385
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,559
I'll have him call Alan and apologise.

386
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,390
No, it's too late for sorries.
Vince is out. Jake Gyllenhaal is in.

387
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,796
Brokeback motherfucking Aquaman.
Take that, bitch.

388
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,637
Read about it in the papers,

389
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,231
but pass it along to Vince or Drama
or whoever will talk to you now.

390
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,319
All net, all net.

391
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,474
- So how was it?
- Talk, E.

392
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,748
Come on, E, what you got?

393
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,869
Nothing good.

394
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,036
Sloan wouldn't let you fuck her either?

395
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,877
Did you skip a breakfast with Alan?

396
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,309
- I told Ari I wasn't going.
- You never told me.

397
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,590
- Fuck Alan.
- Actually no, Vince.

398
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,074
We're the ones that are fucked.

399
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,869
English
