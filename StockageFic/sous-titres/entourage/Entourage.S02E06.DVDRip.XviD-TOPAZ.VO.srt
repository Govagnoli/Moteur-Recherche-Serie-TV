1
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,905
Okay, wait for it... wait.

2
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,272
Bang! Ha ha!

3
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,334
Get two peas and a biscuit...

4
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,211
and bang!
Left hook, bitch.

5
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,874
Don't even think about getting up.

6
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,646
Why don't you go home
with your mind intact, brother?

7
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,085
If you can't handle the trash talk,
learn how to jab.

8
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,952
Then you won't have to hear it.

9
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:32,355
You know what?
Go cry to your trainer. We're done.

10
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,053
Who you talkin' to?

11
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,324
Just some tool in Iowa
who clearly can't handle my skills.

12
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,159
Oh, Jesus, what?
You've been up all night?

13
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,826
You know it. Gotta train.
Somebody's got to earn us some money.

14
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,459
Ah yeah, right,
the X-Box tournament.

15
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,970
That 10 grand should really
keep us in diamonds and furs.

16
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,632
Yo, Vince,
he's messing up my training.

17
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,369
What're you doing, E?

18
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,809
Don't mess with his head.
Guy's my top earner.

19
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:55,144
Hey, I'm gonna be contributing
to the pot too. Vince, tell these guys.

20
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,342
All right, you tell them
your plan, Johnny.

21
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,647
I measured my room.
It's 600 square feet.

22
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,278
That's 10% of the home.

23
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,755
Now the mortgage
costs $24,000 a month.

24
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,054
I'm gonna pay
$2,400 a month

25
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,117
and I'm gonna own
10% of the house.

26
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,924
Where are you gonna get
$2,400 a month?

27
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,396
What, do you think
I cook for free?

28
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:15,398
Okay, so Johnny's got his plan.

29
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:19,166
Turtle's got a plan.
What's your plan, Manager?

30
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:20,968
I'm working on some
things, Vince.

31
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,874
You may wanna work on calling
Emily back. She left three messages.

32
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,468
What am I gonna say,
"I'm an idiot"?

33
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,037
"I shouldn't have promised you
the print of a movie I can't get?"

34
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,548
I like the idiot part.

35
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,777
Why don't you call Walsh?

36
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,514
Ah, see, here's the thing
you don't seem to be grasping.

37
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,318
- I don't make the calls.
- He don't make the calls.

38
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,120
- I make the movies.
- He's the movie star.

39
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,356
And I make the money,
or at least I used to.

40
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,295
Till he hired this guy.

41
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,322
- You wanted to hire me yesterday.
- That was yesterday, bro.

42
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,765
I'll make some calls.

43
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:52,532
Hey, the manager's working.

44
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,137
Go get 'em!

45
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,734
Eric, do not fear.

46
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,109
I got my top lieutenants meeting me
in the war room in 10 minutes.

47
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,171
Ari, I'm getting killed over here.
Vince isn't happy.

48
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,150
Course he's not happy. Nobody's happy
in this town except for the losers.

49
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,016
Look at me, I'm miserable,
that's why I'm rich.

50
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,248
Cut the bullshit, I'm serious.
Vince needs a job.

51
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,122
Sounds like you might too.
I tell you what, Domino's is hiring.

52
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,388
Why don't you put that little pizza sign
on top of your Maserati?

53
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:15,655
Now that is comedy.

54
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,391
Getting dragged through your office
in front of your entire staff

55
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:21,366
by a guy half your size,
now that's tragedy.

56
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,435
Okay, people,
cancel your lunches.

57
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,604
We are going to close
The Ivy today

58
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:36,774
'cause no one is leaving this room
until we score a big payday

59
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,785
for my boy Vinnie Chase.
Who wants to be a hero?

60
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,218
Liz?

61
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,085
David E. Kelley's got
a terrific new pilot.

62
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:44,612
Television?

63
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,717
Lots of movie stars are doing
TV now, Ari. Gary Sinise...

64
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,854
Well, when Vince looks like
Gary Sinise, he'll do television.

65
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,694
Peter Gallagher,
Anthony LaPaglia...

66
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,824
Get out.

67
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,496
Seriously,
get the fuck out.

68
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:02,065
Don't even grab a bagel.
Next!

69
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,443
- Davies, what've you got?
- Tobey just fell out of something.

70
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,851
Could probably get Vince
half what they were gonna give him.

71
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,754
All right, that is
what I'm talking about.

72
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,248
You, my friend,
deserve some very expensive lox.

73
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,388
Would you tell Mr. Wick
that Eric Murphy called again?

74
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,898
Murphy, M-u-r-p-h-y.

75
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,197
Yeah, I'm Vincent Chase's manager.

76
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,260
Look how puffy
his eyes are.

77
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,795
Damn, I'm telling him
to get more power on my hooks.

78
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,068
Check this out.

79
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,837
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

80
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,969
Oh, I think you knocked
his molar out. Look at this.

81
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,139
If only life came with
a joystick, huh, Turtle?

82
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,477
Yeah, I know.

83
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,983
- Anything?
- They won't call me back.

84
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,316
It's like they don't believe
I'm your manager.

85
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,820
We don't believe it.
Why should they?

86
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,857
I do like the action
you're gettin' off this thing.

87
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,883
I know, it's like
I'm superhuman.

88
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:58,385
I know 250 bucks is a lot to spend
on a controller, but you know what?

89
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,194
Fuck it, it's a tax
deduction, right?

90
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,133
You have to have an income
to have a tax deduction.

91
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,829
Where's Vince's income, player?

92
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,667
This controller,
a bag of crip weed

93
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,798
and I'm walking
away with the belt.

94
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,832
Uh, Turtle, about the weed,
I forgot to tell you.

95
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,674
I spoke to Scott
over at E.A.

96
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,476
He says this year at the tournament
they're drug-testing people.

97
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,210
- That's funny.
- I'm dead serious.

98
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,013
And don't embarrass me.

99
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,020
I don't want them taking me
off the players' club list.

100
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,351
Are you fucking with me?

101
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,583
Turtle, I got no money,
I got no job,

102
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,649
I don't have the energy
to be fucking with you.

103
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,664
Don't fuck around.

104
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,029
Hey, Ari.

105
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,091
Eric, I got the cash
you wanted.

106
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:38,126
Yeah? Did you dust off your tranny
gear and hit Santa Monica Blvd?

107
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,435
That's not bad. Meet me
at Earth Cafe in 20 minutes.

108
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,464
- I'm with Vince.
- Perfect, he'll love this.

109
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,874
- Mike Hyer's on line three!
- Does it look like I'm here?

110
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:48,210
- We got a gig.
- What kind of gig?

111
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,681
Chaing Chung.

112
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:55,478
- What?
- Chaing Chung.

113
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,989
Do you know what
he's talking about?

114
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,821
No. What the fuck
are you saying, Ari?

115
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,259
Chaing Chung is the hottest
director in Hong Kong.

116
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:05,753
Tarantino has already decided he's
the next guy he wants to steal from.

117
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,494
Cool, the guy must be good.
Tarantino only steals from the best.

118
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,297
- That's right, baby.
- So what's the movie?

119
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,133
Not a movie.

120
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,901
- What is it? Is it a TV show?
- No.

121
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:18,468
Let me guess. Does it rhyme with...
what the fuck is it, Ari?

122
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,376
- Tell us.
- It's a commercial.

123
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:23,405
If you can't protect yourself,

124
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,110
the referee
has to do it for you.

125
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,585
You're dropping your guard.
You're dropping your guard.

126
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,451
I can't play when I'm not stoned.

127
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,787
Well, smoke a joint then,
'cause you can't win like this.

128
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,792
You heard Vince,
I gotta be drug-tested.

129
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,454
Weed stays
in your system for 30 days.

130
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,431
Nobody says you've got
to quit smoking.

131
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:42,434
You just got to find
yourself some clean urine.

132
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,834
It's the Chinese
motherfucking Red Bull.

133
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,362
They guzzle it over there.
It's on every corner.

134
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,534
I can't believe you want me
to do a commercial.

135
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,339
Ari, I started in this
business peddling Mentos.

136
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,005
I don't wanna go back.

137
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:57,379
Vinnie, all the big shots,
all of them, do foreign commercials.

138
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,046
You think L. Ron pays for
Travolta's planes? Please!

139
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:05,456
Big John has been pumping
the Japs full of Sanka for years.

140
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,925
Ari, come on,
my grandfather is Japanese.

141
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,757
What I say, Japs?
Is that derogatory?

142
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,525
If you call Wick,
set up a screening...

143
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,395
Are you kidding me?
I'm not gonna call Wick

144
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,298
because I do not want
James Cameron to see the movie.

145
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:18,633
I'm still working on getting
the meeting back that you fucked up.

146
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,605
You let Rumplestiltskin
run your career.

147
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,437
Oh, like you're doing
so fucking great, Ari?

148
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,706
I mean, you promised the guy a statue,
I guess you meant the Clio, right?

149
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,736
Ari, I don't want
to do a commercial.

150
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,806
Vinnie, it will never appear
on U.S. Soil, all right?

151
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,841
It is one day's work.

152
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,284
He said he doesn't wanna
do a commercial.

153
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,719
For half a million dollars.

154
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,157
What was the director's
name again?

155
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,458
Cha-ching! I'm sorry,
Chaing Chung, boom!

156
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,124
500 grand a day?

157
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,656
We should do 100 of these a year.
That's 50 million.

158
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,566
Take the other 265 days off.

159
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,730
That's better than
a teacher's schedule.

160
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,138
What do you think, E?
No more movies, no more critics.

161
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:58,234
Why be a movie star when you can be
an international spokesperson?

162
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:01,440
Yeah, I remember
my first national commercial.

163
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,073
Oh, what was that,
Valtrex?

164
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,515
Yeah it was,
so fucking what?

165
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,246
It got me my Fiat.

166
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,483
Plus I got a blow job from
the makeup girl putting my sores on.

167
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,991
- That's nice.
- I wanna live in China.

168
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:16,324
Hey, Vince, why don't we replace Olga
with one of these hot geisha girls?

169
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:19,058
Geisha girls are
from Japan, jackass.

170
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,067
My point is we should have
a hot cleaning lady who fucks.

171
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,569
- Then she'd be a hooker?
- Yeah, a hooker who cleans.

172
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,442
Oh fuck,
it's Emily again.

173
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,171
You can run,
but you can't hide.

174
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,042
I'm stalling till Wick
calls me back.

175
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,981
No, I hate it when people tell me
they can't get my agent on the phone.

176
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,315
Don't let me start hearing about
my manager too. Answer the phone.

177
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,218
No, you know what?
I'll take it.

178
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,985
Come on, I'll tell her
you're immersed in meetings.

179
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,925
- Emily.
- Vince, hi.

180
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,156
- Hi, how are you?
- Good.

181
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,960
Oh my God, wait...
no, stop!

182
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:56,560
Stop! He's trying to rip the phone
from my hands, can you believe it?

183
00:08:56,602 --> 00:09:00,368
Oh, Jesus, relax!
God! Oh, take it.

184
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,431
Hey, Emily.

185
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,410
Eric, do not make like you haven't
got my last 20 messages.

186
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:08,379
Uh, well... I'm having
a hard time getting the print.

187
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,678
What you mean? How hard can it be
to get a print of a movie?

188
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,411
The director is a bit
of an egomaniac.

189
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,817
Does he know James Cameron
wants to see his movie?

190
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,515
Yeah, that didn't
really impress him.

191
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,047
Eric, I cleared James'
whole schedule for this.

192
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,956
Don't make me look
like an asshole.

193
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,461
If you can't get it to me,
let me know as soon as possible.

194
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,521
Okay.

195
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,123
Mr. Chase?

196
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,727
I'm Li Lei, Mr. Chung's
technical advisor.

197
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,761
Yeah, Li Lei, you did
all the fight sequences

198
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,831
in Lau and Mak's "Infernal Affairs."
Those scenes were amazing.

199
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,309
Wait till you see what Mr. Chung
has in store for you,

200
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,142
even more amazing.
Follow me this way.

201
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,449
Trying to tell me
you wouldn't want her

202
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:47,008
technically advising us
on how to clean the house?

203
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,663
Chung's vision is based
firmly in wu xia pian.

204
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,260
But he will incorporate kung fu

205
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:07,534
as an homage to Chinese
new wave cinema. A sort of wire fu.

206
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,178
He will draw
from Chinese mythology

207
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,840
and esoteric aspects
of the martial art.

208
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,984
Chung sees you
as an heroic knight

209
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,821
fighting to uphold justice
in a mystical realm

210
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:30,226
where you fight powerful clans
of villains who dominate society

211
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,059
and vie for control
of the martial world.

212
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,566
It will include swordplay, flying,

213
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,727
magic and weapons.

214
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,695
Chung wants to know
if you've ever seen

215
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,264
"Chinese Ghost Story"
or "Swordsman."

216
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,970
Yeah, tell him Tsui Hark
is one of my favorites.

217
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,010
Now imagine Tsui Hark
on three bottles of Red Bull.

218
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,516
Very exciting stuff.

219
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:01,458
Now we drink.
Cheers!

220
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,429
As long as the interpreter
wasn't making up her own stuff,

221
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:07,455
- this guy's got an interesting vision.
- I think it sounds amazing.

222
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,934
Maybe we should hook up
with this guy after and do a movie.

223
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,561
Now you're talking.
That's a good idea.

224
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:15,768
Does his vision include any roles
for anyone else who might need a role?

225
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,174
Johnny, you know
I always take care of you.

226
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,144
- Yeah, our man.
- Yeah!

227
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,044
Hey Vince, Chaing loved you.

228
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,912
- He's very excited.
- Oh great.

229
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,577
He wants you and I
to get together immediately

230
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,450
so I can work you
through some moves.

231
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:29,818
Yeah, I taught him
a few things.

232
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,720
Brandon Lee and I
used to train together.

233
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,349
In fact, I had a small part
in "The Crow."

234
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:34,950
Yeah, he was the bird.

235
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:38,259
The Lee clan practically
adopted me.

236
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,959
Me and Brandon used to go
to Mandarette twice a week.

237
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,595
Why don't you meet me
at gym today?

238
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,606
Bring your friends.
I show them moves too.

239
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,268
Sounds good.

240
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:56,141
- She's very dominating.
- I know, I like it.

241
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:59,174
You really gonna wear that color
like you earned it, huh?

242
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,277
What are you talking about?
I earned this belt.

243
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,878
In fact, I went
as high as a green.

244
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,652
I just like to wear the yellow
cause it makes my eyes pop.

245
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,215
Any luck with Wick?

246
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,124
I finally got his secretary
to tell me he's at home.

247
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,891
- Headed over there right now.
- Aggressive, I like that.

248
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,831
Hey, if you were as hot
as Li I might go with you.

249
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,595
Come on, Turtle, let's go.

250
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,467
Vince, if you don't mind, as much
as I'd like to see Li Lei sweating,

251
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,905
I gotta pass on the gym. Hack's got me
a lead on some clean urine.

252
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:25,604
I'll explain it later, bro.
You're gonna love it.

253
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,544
Looks like it's just
you and me, bro,

254
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,549
just like the old days
before these jerkoffs were around.

255
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,143
He's dropping bombs
on his opponent.

256
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,585
I see you in 'em hot-ass
shorts you've got on.

257
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,454
Oh, shit, oh!

258
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,857
You're getting kind of good
at this shit, huh?

259
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,861
Good?
You're a heavyweight,

260
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,557
I'm beating your ass
with a 110-Ib. Filipino, bitch.

261
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,328
Don't get cocky, motherfucker,
I'll beat your ass in real life.

262
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:51,063
I got the high score
in that shit.

263
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,664
Hey yo, Brandon, watch
your little fleshy pisser, motherfucker.

264
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,938
I don't want you to get a drop of piss
on my imported Italian marble.

265
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,036
Oh, you're down, baby.

266
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,707
It's over! Don't even
bother getting up.

267
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:11,284
Hi, uh... Eric Murphy.
Is your dad home?

268
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,484
My dad?

269
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,926
My dad lives in Tennessee.

270
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:19,795
You must be looking for
my daddy. Come in, he's at the pool.

271
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:33,172
Yo! Nunchucks, bro!
It's been a while.

272
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,942
See if I still got it.

273
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,782
I see you have had
some training.

274
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,760
Yeah, I wasn't
bullshitting you.

275
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:51,957
- How 'bout you, Vince?
- Uh, I'm a blank canvas.

276
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,726
I'm a little more athletic than Vince,

277
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,758
so you might wanna
demonstrate stuff on me first.

278
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:00,169
So you're the athlete
in the family, huh, Johnny?

279
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:03,334
Athlete with a nice
yellow belt.

280
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,310
I see so many American
wearing these belts

281
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,438
and yet they do not
earn the level.

282
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,049
What are you saying?

283
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,314
Nothing.

284
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:18,722
It is just in true kung fu,
we never show duan wei with belt.

285
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,622
It is not Chinese way.

286
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,150
So what is
the Chinese way?

287
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,490
This golden dragon
stands for jinlong,

288
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,765
ninth level,
the highest level.

289
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:35,831
Well look, little Lei Lu,
I earned this level.

290
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,605
And for your information,
we're in America.

291
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:42,273
Okay, so do you want
we spar a little?

292
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:45,044
Warm up?
Show Vince your moves?

293
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:48,985
No.

294
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,114
Oh, come on, I wanna see
your athleticism.

295
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,624
No, Vince,
I'm not beating up a girl.

296
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,719
Only girl in the room is
the one wearing pretty yellow belt.

297
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:58,457
You calling me a girl?

298
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,624
If the belt fits.

299
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,794
Don't say I didn't warn you.

300
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,441
Oh, you want some of that?

301
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:13,206
What if I was to do
a little something like this, huh?

302
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,106
What if I was to do a little
something like that?

303
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,952
Okay, you wanna
play hardball, huh?

304
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,284
You want some of this, huh?

305
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:30,591
Go get her, Johnny,
come on.

306
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,332
Good athleticism,
Johnny.

307
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,742
I work with Vince now.

308
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,748
You go next door,
get dim sum.

309
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,784
Yeah, dim sum,
that's a good idea.

310
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,151
My blood sugar
is kind of low.

311
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:59,214
You know, I didn't have any breakfast
this morning, right?

312
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,453
- Take it easy.
- I'll see you later.

313
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,393
You think you can
do that to me?

314
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,476
No, you do it to me.

315
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,947
We need you to look
like the expert.

316
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,793
If you want to be
hard as iron,

317
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:47,363
you must first master
laying horse stance.

318
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,170
Yes, ma'am.

319
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,836
Sorry about
the son comment.

320
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,038
Oh, don't worry about that.

321
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,707
You know,
he still might be my son yet.

322
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,616
I can adopt him,
I just can't marry him.

323
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,511
Great country, right?

324
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,386
So, Eric, what's up?

325
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,449
You know Vince is up
for "Aquaman," right?

326
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,188
Hmm, it's a great script.

327
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,423
I passed on it
the first time around, you know?

328
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,658
And now that
Cameron's doing it,

329
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,564
don't I look
like the fool?

330
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,501
Anyway I promised him
a print of "Queens Boulevard,"

331
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,026
but Walsh won't give me one.

332
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,699
Oh, that Walsh,
he's such a brazen bastard.

333
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,935
He's a very tough guy
to talk to.

334
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,672
Will you talk to him
for me? For Vince?

335
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,272
Vince isn't here.

336
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,715
But you are.

337
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,777
So if I do this for you,

338
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:39,552
my scrumptious little Irishman,

339
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,650
what're you gonna do for me?

340
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:44,253
Hmm?

341
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:48,027
I am fucking with you.

342
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,729
L... God, you should've
seen yourself.

343
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:54,432
Anyway, yes, I will call.
I will call.

344
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:01,645
- What position is this?
- I just invented it.

345
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,547
Do you think Chaing will let us
use this in the commercial?

346
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,279
He may.
He's very creative.

347
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,950
No problem.

348
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,933
All right,
let's get this over with.

349
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,435
Where do I take
the piss test?

350
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,165
- The what?
- The drug test.

351
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,038
I drank three bottles of water
in the car for this,

352
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:31,133
so could we just get this
over with, please?

353
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,576
This is X-Box, loser,
not the Olympics.

354
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,376
We don't give drug tests. If we did
we'd be out of business, idiot.

355
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,576
- Sucker!
- They got you, Turtle.

356
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,479
- What the fuck do I do with this now?
- Drink it.

357
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,487
Aha, you're not
so tough now, huh?

358
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,224
Those games are fucking bullshit.

359
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,562
Calm down, Li.

360
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,535
I can't believe they put me up
against a little kid.

361
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,970
- I don't know, he looks pretty tough.
- He's right.

362
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,998
Don't get overconfident.
You've got to respect your opponent.

363
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:07,239
I want you to go over there, look
the kid in the eyes and say good luck.

364
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,747
- It'll shake 'em.
- All right.

365
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,772
Good luck, Turtle.

366
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,781
It looks like it's me and you
in the first round, kid.

367
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,885
I just wanna wish you
good luck.

368
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,725
Yeah, you too,
fat boy.

369
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,230
Ha ha!

370
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,393
Little wise-ass.

371
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,137
Hey.

372
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,142
Eric, I tried.
I tried, but...

373
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,542
Walsh is a Neanderthal.

374
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,138
- You look very nice.
- What'd he say?

375
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,581
He said that I should
go fuck my mother.

376
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,779
He says it's his movie.
His movie! Can you believe that?

377
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,686
Oh, I swear to Christ,

378
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,885
if this movie isn't genius,
I'm gonna have him killed.

379
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,554
What are you talking about? You can't
get the print of your own movie.

380
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,496
- You're not having anyone killed.
- You're right, I know.

381
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,898
But I do have a guy who could
seriously destroy his credit.

382
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,733
Oh well then,
thanks for trying.

383
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:14,277
- Okay, now duck. You have to duck.
- Duck?

384
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,304
Yeah, you gotta learn
how to defend yourself.

385
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,179
Vince, can I talk
to you for a second?

386
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,980
This is important,
come on.

387
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,952
Okay, just keep practicing that

388
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,547
and you'll be a champ
before you know it.

389
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,081
Duck.

390
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,717
- Duck.
- Rematch?

391
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,763
All right, look,
I spoke to Wick.

392
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,630
Walsh says no go.
I'm sorry.

393
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,600
What are you sorry for?

394
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,695
'Cause I fucked up. If you don't
get this movie it's my fault.

395
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,036
You don't really
believe that, do you?

396
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,872
Ari got you the meeting.
I told him to postpone it.

397
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,674
Ah, E...

398
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,238
I mean,

399
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,250
the truth is, I fucked up.

400
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,980
I shouldn't have bought the house
before I had the money.

401
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,888
Ari fucked up because he shouldn't have
told me we had a deal when we didn't.

402
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,290
I mean you thought
the script was great, and it is.

403
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,317
James Cameron's doing it.

404
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,193
Yeah, you're right.

405
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,131
I didn't fuck up at all. What are you
giving me such a hard time for?

406
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,565
It's my job.

407
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,865
Look, if James Cameron
wants me for the movie,

408
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:15,236
he'll set the meeting.
Or he'll see something I've done.

409
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,799
There's nothing we can do.
It's out of our hands.

410
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:21,142
- If he sees "Queens Boulevard" though...
- We're gonna make $500,000.

411
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,808
Half a mil for the day's
work tomorrow.

412
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,715
I'm not getting
myself down.

413
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,550
You know my father didn't make that
in in his whole life.

414
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:32,056
No, mine either.
He owed it though.

415
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,423
Yeah, so forget
about "Aquaman."

416
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,419
If it's meant to be, then it's
meant to be, otherwise fuck it.

417
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,524
Hey, besides, worse comes to worst,
we always have Turtle.

418
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,967
Yeah, we always
have Turtle.

419
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,595
- Come on.
- All right, I'll call Emily.

420
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,129
- I'll meet you in there.
- All right, man.

421
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:54,772
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Hollywood Circuit

422
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:59,614
and the X-Box and E.A.'s
"Fight Night" championship.

423
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,482
And now...

424
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,978
let's get ready to rumble.

425
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,057
In the red corner,
from Queens, New York,

426
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,792
height unknown,

427
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,096
weight unknown,

428
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,728
fighting as Rocky Marciano,

429
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:23,935
introducing Turtle!

430
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,409
Turtle! Yeah!

431
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,643
Turtle! Turtle!
Turtle!

432
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,651
In the blue corner,
from the Sunshine State,

433
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:38,122
two-time X-Box
Southeast Conference Champion,

434
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:43,423
Herby Green!

435
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,125
You're a bum!

436
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,029
We go to first-round action.

437
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,764
Come on, Turtle!

438
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,005
One and two, kid!
Can't take it like a man!

439
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:00,810
- Oh!
- He's getting killed.

440
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,818
Yeah! Yeah!

441
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:11,016
It's all over
in the very first round!

442
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,024
The winner by a knockout,

443
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:16,858
Herby Green!

444
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,866
You guys think
I smoke too much pot?

445
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,535
Turtle, relax. You lost
a video game tournament.

446
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,942
Yeah, Turtle, in our eyes,
you're still the champ.

447
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,379
The kid obviously had some
kind of a cheat code, bro.

448
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,907
I heard he was a beta tester
for that game. Knew every in and out.

449
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,119
- I'm working.
- I'm working.

450
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:47,091
- Drama, smoke?
- What am I, not working?

451
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,393
We're ready
for you guys.

452
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,961
- Go get 'em.
- All right.

453
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,269
Guess who Cameron wants
to play Aquaman's mother?

454
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,075
I don't know, Ari.
Cloris Leachman?

455
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,638
Huh-uh, Sharon Stone.

456
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,445
Guess who represents
Sharon Stone?

457
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,042
- You do.
- Uh-huh.

458
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,918
Take a guess who Sharon Stone
is absolutely in love with.

459
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,116
It ain't you,
you little bitch.

460
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,022
- It's you.
- Really, like love love?

461
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,357
Well, she told Cameron
last night at dinner

462
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26,364
her favorite actor
in this town is you.

463
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,593
- Sharon Stone said that?
- Absolutely.

464
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,124
- She's still good looking.
- Yeah, in the right light.

465
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:33,569
- So what do we do now?
- We bundle up and hit the slopes

466
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,163
'cause James Cameron
is coming to Sundance.

467
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,640
What, just to see me?

468
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:40,008
And to see the prick director that won't
show him a print of the goddamn movie.

469
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,774
- It better kill.
- Chung's ready for you.

470
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,542
He says we're losing light.

471
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,244
Okay. Good stuff, Ari.

472
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,514
- Good stuff, Ari.
- Uh-huh, you see that?

473
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,214
Go get 'em, baby.

474
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,395
I've been looking for you.

475
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,794
I haven't been hiding.

476
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,466
It's too bad you came alone.

477
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:17,238
I am not alone.

478
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,168
Hey, bro!

479
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:46,041
Drink this!

480
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,556
Like I said,

481
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,422
too bad you came alone.

482
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:40,987
The Energy Drink.
Good till your heart pops!
