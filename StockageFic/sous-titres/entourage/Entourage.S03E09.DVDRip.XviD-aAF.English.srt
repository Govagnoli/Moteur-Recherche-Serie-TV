1
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,193
- So they're just gonna give him 100 grand?
- Cash in a bag.

2
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,596
- Just to show up to a party?
- You don't even have to smile, Vin.

3
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,154
- Only in America.
- No, only in Vegas.

4
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,031
So what do you say, E? Should we go?

5
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,870
As you told Hollywood the town is a bunch of
dickheads, I don't think anybody will miss us.

6
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,912
- So you say we should go.
- Have I ever said no to Vegas?

7
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,552
Be like saying no to a blowjob.

8
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,352
What do you say, Johnny? Vegas?

9
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,153
Love to, bro, but I'm shooting my pilot
on the 30th.

10
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,953
- I gotta stay rested.
- You're turning down Vegas?

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,152
I'll turn down a lot of things, Turtle,
now I'm a working actor. Get used to it.

12
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,509
Johnny, there are many different Vegases.

13
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,519
You could go and just spot. Don't you have
a masseuse you love over there?

14
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,996
Yeah, Ken at the Hard Rock.
He's got hands of gold.

15
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,474
It's insane that you let a man rub your body.

16
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,353
What's insane is that you think
a massage is sexual.

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,757
A real massage requires strong, manly hands,
which my boy Ken has got in spades.

18
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,635
After 24 hours with Ken, I'm ready for work.
Absolutely, bro, I'm in.

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,238
Nice. Let's do it.

20
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,716
- Who's gonna break the news to Ari?
- Be happy to.

21
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,072
Vin, this is not the time to go to Vegas.
You've got a public image problem.

22
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,635
Hoping by the time I get back,
everyone will have forgotten.

23
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,389
Vinnie, we need to get you a job.
You read any of those scripts?

24
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,510
I thought you might read 'em to me.

25
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,677
- What do you mean?
- I mean, we could use a chaperone.

26
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,235
- Keep us out of trouble.
- I'm not going to Vegas on a Wednesday.

27
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,751
- What else you got to do?
- The theatre with the wife and her mother.

28
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,392
Move over, I'm in.

29
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,273
Nice, relaxing Wednesday
may be just what I need.

30
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,311
Vegas, baby, Vegas!

31
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,516
I'm sorry, baby. I'd rather be at Menopause,
the Musical tonight, but I got kidnapped!

32
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,596
- It's true!
- You see that, baby?

33
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,232
I'm sorry, honey...

34
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,475
- Hello? Hello?
- Is she mad?

35
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,832
She said she'd rather see me gagged and
bound like a real kidnappee, so I think so.

36
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,228
Here comes the apology. Hey, baby.

37
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,149
I put $6 million into this company
and find out that you're at the roulette table?

38
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,589
- Babs, how are ya?
- What are you doing, Ari?

39
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,279
I'm taking care of a high-priority client.

40
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,074
You have 150 clients.
You need to manage your time more efficiently.

41
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,680
- You're not my mother, Babs.
- Fuck you, Ari.

42
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,679
See, my mother would never speak to me
that way. I hate women!

43
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,438
Not all women.

44
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,993
Who's got five?

45
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,554
- Ready and waiting, bro.
- What's this?

46
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,559
As kids we'd put five bucks on red.
We win, we knew it'd be a good weekend.

47
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,795
- What if you lose?
- Vince never loses.

48
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,512
Five on red.

49
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,879
Come on!

50
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,389
Red 16.

51
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,559
- It's gonna be a good weekend.
- Keep the change.

52
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,751
Hey, Vinnie, shall we go halves?
A gambling partnership.

53
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,233
- OK, Ari.
- All right.

54
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,396
- Vinnie Chase.
- Seth.

55
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,112
- What's up, dude?
- What's up?

56
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,550
Are you here for that thing at Body English?
It should be fun.

57
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,273
- I brought my crew.
- You know Ari Gold, my agent?

58
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,151
Never met, big fan.

59
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,397
That's funny, dude.
That pinky bought me a house in Malibu.

60
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,112
Malibu!

61
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,276
And I think you know E.

62
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,108
- Seth, good to see you.
- How'd that thing work out for you at the hotel?

63
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,950
- Like I said, it wasn't what it looked like.
- Like I said, it never is. How's Sloan, man?

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,718
She's still good, Seth.

65
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,035
Do me a favour. Tell her I said, "What up."

66
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,117
- I will. I'll tell her that.
- All right. See ya.

67
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,239
- What's up, Seth?
- Johnny Drama. How you doing?

68
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,999
- Did you hear about my pilot?
- No. Congratulations!

69
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,272
- Thanks, bro.
- Good for you, man! You could use the work.

70
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,950
Every time I see him, he asks me about Sloan
and he's got a shit-eating grin on his face.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,470
- Don't panic, E.
- You'd be jealous if he said they were cousins.

72
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,954
- What does that mean?
- You're a jealous guy.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,956
- Always have been.
- Bullshit.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,276
- E, you're like Eric Roberts in Star 80.
- How would you know?

75
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,550
- I've heard stories.
- Name one example.

76
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,594
Andy Abetemarco. You punched him because
he got to be Audrey Polini's lab partner.

77
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,074
There's more to that story, he stole her frog.

78
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,872
- They got married.
- Really?

79
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,388
- No, but you're still jealous.
- Whatever.

80
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,637
- Exactly. I don't think Seth meant anything.
- All right.

81
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,955
Nice room, Turtle.

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,230
Boys, fruit's all green.

83
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,918
Easy with that, Ari.

84
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,552
It's from Body English.

85
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,556
100K, Vince.

86
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,438
- Nice.
- Vinnie, who'd you have to fuck to get that?

87
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,189
- No fucking, Ari. I just have to go to a party.
- Not according to this.

88
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,835
You got a pool event
and then drinks with the contestants tonight.

89
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,029
Contestants?

90
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,709
- Says you're judging a beauty contest.
- Sounds like a bonus.

91
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,753
- I don't know what you got us into.
- So far it all looks pretty good.

92
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,597
We'll see. I'm gonna check it out.

93
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,757
I'm comin' with you.
Vinnie, go win us some money.

94
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,030
Goddamn, I feel at ease.

95
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,399
I'm out.

96
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,271
You brought your own robe?

97
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,878
Why wouldn't I?

98
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,995
- Mind if we join you?
- Sure.

99
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,634
- I'll take some chips, please.
- All of it?

100
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,274
- Well, 10 is yours, do what you want.
- Really?

101
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,313
- Yeah, man. Commission. You earned it.
- Thank you, Vince!

102
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,073
You booked him into this?

103
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,190
- Turtle did.
- Nice job managing.

104
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,310
This should be great for his image.

105
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,672
- What are you doing?
- I'm on vay-cay. Getting a cocktail.

106
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,155
All right. What are we drinking?

107
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,393
- It's been a while.
- How are ya, buddy?

108
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,879
Good to see ya.
You look great. You look great.

109
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,319
I lost a couple pounds.

110
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,875
- Yeah, it shows.
- Thanks. What have you got there?

111
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,117
California almonds.
I remember last time I was in town

112
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,438
you said you couldn't find a decent almond
in the desert, so I thought, well...

113
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,234
I can't believe you remembered.
That's really thoughtful.

114
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,113
I got an elephant's brain.
I remember everything.

115
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,552
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's do it,

116
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,433
I'm stressed like a motherfucker.

117
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,478
A little of that, a little of this, some of that...

118
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,514
All right, come on, baby! Come on!

119
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,632
- He should just cancel this.
- Definitely.

120
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,558
- He's up 2500.
- Oh yeah?

121
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,273
That means I'm up 1250.
Drinks are on me, E.

122
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,880
- One more for the road?
- Definitely.

123
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,391
Ken, you have not lost your touch.

124
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,674
These compliments
are gonna make me insecure.

125
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,915
Well, don't be. You've got the gift.

126
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,951
- No doubt.
- Thanks.

127
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,072
In fact, I'd like to lock you down
for the rest of the day.

128
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,839
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. I'll double your rate.

129
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,757
Cos I don't want
these hands touching anyone but me.

130
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,399
Hit me.

131
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,637
- Sorry, sir.
- Hey, you can't stay hot forever.

132
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,675
- Hit.
- But Turtle can!

133
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,432
Hey, you signed him up
to judge a stripper contest.

134
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,994
- Really? Titties?
- It's a stripper contest.

135
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,871
- Nice.
- Vin, you should cancel.

136
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,512
- I agree.
- Can't cancel.

137
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,074
- You can. Give the money back.
- Money's gone.

138
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,236
- What?
- I hit a cold streak.

139
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,874
- You lost 100 grand?
- Something like that.

140
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,151
- But we're partners.
- Shit, I forgot.

141
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,838
Means I'm only really down 50.

142
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,758
Shoulda partnered up with me, Ari.
I'm up 1200.

143
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,315
I get to two grand, I'm keeping it stashed
to buy me a high class ho.

144
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,716
- But Turtle, I gave you 10.
- I only pay for pussy with profits.

145
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,911
- I thought you never lose.
- It's not a loss till we leave.

146
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,713
- I'll win it back. Don't worry.
- I'm worried, Vin.

147
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,239
If you want out...

148
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,317
And miss out when you go
on a million-dollar run? No way.

149
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,749
- All right.
- Blow off this stripper thing.

150
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,472
- No, it'll be fun.
- It will be.

151
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,069
- We gotta be at the pool in five minutes.
- Let's do it.

152
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,873
Fuck the pool, let's win our money back.

153
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,911
You don't care if he judges a stripper contest?

154
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,670
Which is worse for his image? That he judges
a stripper contest, or he loses thousands?

155
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,951
- Table's not going anywhere, calm down.
- Hey, yo, E!

156
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,956
Did you tell Sloan I said, "What up"?

157
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,797
- No, Seth.
- Why not?

158
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,400
Because it was like
a half an hour ago.

159
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,355
- It's just a call. Make the call, say, "what up."
- Yeah, E. Make the call, say, "What up."

160
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,949
So he's saying he fucked my girlfriend?

161
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,355
- I don't know, E.
- It's hard to say.

162
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,552
It's not hard. Seth Green landed on
Plymouth Rock before you did, E. Wake up.

163
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,592
- No shot.
- Can we please go and win some money?

164
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,076
The strippers aren't here yet.
E, it could've been years ago.

165
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,759
The guy's been in Hollywood
since he was like 12.

166
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,711
And Sloan does like her men petite.

167
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,149
- I know every guy she's been with.
- How?

168
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,430
- You made a list?
- Yeah. Couples make lists.

169
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,598
- You wouldn't know that for obvious reasons.
- Where the fuck are these girls?

170
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,518
- You and your wife made lists?
- I'm the only one on it.

171
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,678
Yeah, right. Look, E, I don't wanna rile you up,
but I've done the list thing.

172
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,635
- Did you hand over a hard drive, Vin?
- It was big. But I did leave some off.

173
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,558
So you're saying Sloan left Seth Green
off the list?

174
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,593
I think everybody leaves someone off the list.
Except you.

175
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,515
- I'm calling.
- Ain't you gonna call your wife, Ari?

176
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,112
I don't care if my wife's getting fucked right
now, Turtle, I need to get my money back!

177
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,399
- Hi, Vince.
- Hello.

178
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,273
I'm Joanne, but I go by the stage name
of Cheyenne.

179
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,871
I understand you're judging the contest.
What can I do to get you to vote for me?

180
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,593
Yeah, Vince, what's a girl gotta do
to get a vote?

181
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,872
- Vince, we'll be here all day.
- Due to circumstances beyond my control...

182
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,035
Me!

183
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,548
I have to go. But talk to my boy, Turtle.

184
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,592
He's the eyes, mouth and ears
of this operation.

185
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,791
- Enjoy.
- The commission, now this? It's Christmas.

186
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,592
- Hi, Turtle.
- How you doin'?

187
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,517
So you're really his eyes and ears?

188
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,588
Ken, whatever happened to that
pretty little Filipino girlfriend of yours, Annie?

189
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,358
Sore subject.

190
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,197
She just moved out a week ago.

191
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,434
Fuck her.

192
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,710
Hands like yours, her loss.

193
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,150
- Still hurts.
- Yeah, I hear you, Ken.

194
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,671
You know what? Johnny Drama's
got just the cure for your heartbreak.

195
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,312
Really? What's that?

196
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,351
Boys' night out.

197
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,312
Just a good steak,
nice bottle of red,

198
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,318
couple cigars
and some good conversation.

199
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,830
You do that, Ken, and you'll forget
all about women in no time.

200
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,429
I don't usually go out
socially with clients, Johnny.

201
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,553
Ken, I'd like to think after all this time
you see me as more than just a client.

202
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,396
- Oh, Eric. He's so annoying.
- Annoying how?

203
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,592
We were on a teen tour together, and he was
obsessed with me for the entire trip.

204
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,950
- But you never dated him?
- No, Eric, I never dated him.

205
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,793
This is a tough competition, girls,
and what with a $25,000 prize,

206
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,831
everybody needs an edge.

207
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,589
Fortunately for you,
I left my integrity back in Los Angeles.

208
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,393
My vote is 100% for sale.

209
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,319
Hit me.

210
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,039
Jesus!

211
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,511
What the fuck are you smirking about?
Where are you going?

212
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,438
- You can't force the cards.
- How much are we down?

213
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,516
110. Each.

214
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,595
Jesus!

215
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,916
- We'll get it back after dinner.
- I'm not hungry, Vinnie.

216
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,758
You take the reins,
maybe you'll have better luck.

217
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,713
Don't go too crazy,
I don't wanna lose more than 500 grand.

218
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,678
Bring it. Bring it!

219
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,598
So you talked to her
and she said nothing happened?

220
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,108
- Right.
- Why's he making out something did?

221
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,390
- Cos he's a jerk-off.
- Why are you so calm?

222
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,318
The old E would not have been able
to control himself.

223
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,670
The old E, "Mad Dog" E,
woulda bit Seth Green's ear off.

224
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,190
- I'm a grown man. I don't fight any more.
- Way to be mature.

225
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,800
You're entering your latter years gracefully.

226
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,671
Speaking of latter years...

227
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,472
Fuck off, E.

228
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,078
How relaxed do I look?

229
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,069
You look like you died in 1983.

230
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,753
Wait till you see me after a shower,
I'm gonna sparkle like the 4th of July.

231
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,759
Wait till dinner. I got ten of the best strippers
in town joining us.

232
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,273
Strippers? Why?

233
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,118
- Shouldn't it be, "Strippers? Thank you"?
- Thank you.

234
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,355
We don't want girls at the table tonight.

235
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,709
I'm trying to keep this trip free of distractions.

236
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,799
- We? Who's "we"?
- Ken. He's gonna be joining us tonight.

237
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,674
You don't want strippers at dinner
cos your gay masseuse is joining us?

238
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,756
I'm really starting to worry about you, Drama.

239
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,791
Please, Turtle, Ken is not gay.

240
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:48,198
In fact, if I release him on the strippers tonight,
you're gonna be shit out of luck.

241
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,231
Please. Bring it on.

242
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,393
So, have you seen Brokeback Mountain,
Kenneth?

243
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,510
Nah. I don't get to the movies.

244
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,836
- When I'm not working, I'm usually training.
- For what?

245
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,031
It's probably too late for me,
but I still dream of the NFL.

246
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,709
- You play ball?
- Ken was a superstar at U of A.

247
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,591
I don't know about superstar.

248
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,029
Oh, yes. Yes, you were.

249
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,277
And a second-round draft pick
for the San Diego Chargers.

250
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,474
Went 74 yards and three receptions in
his first NFL quarter, then blew out his knee.

251
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,192
Fucking AstroTurf.

252
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,832
That sucks, man.

253
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,395
- You really do remember everything, Johnny.
- Elephant brain.

254
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,635
Turtle, girls.

255
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,394
Watch this.

256
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,998
- Hey, Shelby.
- Hi, Turtle.

257
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,473
- Crystal.
- Hi, Turtle.

258
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,033
- Tiffany.
- Hi, sweetie.

259
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,514
- This is Bunny. And Minx.
- Hey, Turtle.

260
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,671
Yo, E, be cool.

261
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,990
I'm cool, Vince. I'm totally cool.

262
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,238
What do ya got? Come on.
Show me a little love. What do ya think?

263
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,315
Fuck!

264
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,871
Can I have another marker?

265
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,953
Please?

266
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,430
This is Mount Kilimanjaro, one of the tallest
mountains on earth and it's freezing.

267
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,078
So I say to this girl,

268
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,317
"I'd be happy to give up my canteen for you,

269
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,715
"but what are you gonna give up for me?"

270
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,198
Fantastic.

271
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,234
I gotta hit the head. I'll be right back.

272
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,909
So?

273
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,915
- I love him.
- I told you.

274
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,999
Let's hit the bar. Maybe I should check on Ari,
see how he's doing.

275
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,272
- He can't be doing any worse than you.
- Oh, it's Vinnie Chase and the chasers!

276
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,835
Hey, let me get a couple more Jager shots
for the boys from Queens.

277
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,711
- No, thanks.
- You don't drink?

278
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,638
Seth, I stopped drinking Jager in high school.

279
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,475
But listen, I told Sloan you said, "What up."

280
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,396
- What did she say?
- She said, "What up."

281
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,954
- That's all?
- That's all.

282
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,877
All right. All right.

283
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,195
You tell her I said, "What up" back.

284
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,755
Yeah, man. Don't forget to tell her
he said, "What up" back.

285
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,753
- What is it with them? They're like retards.
- Yeah, but you were calm.

286
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,234
But is it gonna last, E? Or are we doing battle?

287
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,874
We're not doin' battle. It ain't gonna happen.

288
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,114
All right.

289
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,597
All this testosterone has put a kink in my neck.
I'll have to get Ken to work that out.

290
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,076
Better hurry up, Drama,
he's working one out right now.

291
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,315
Christ almighty.

292
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,798
That's Amber. Promised me three days
in her father's cabin in Montana if she wins.

293
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,355
Turtle, I can't pick someone
cos she promised to fuck you.

294
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,039
I don't care who wins.
I cut deals with all of 'em.

295
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,200
Sweetheart, this guy's with me tonight.

296
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,516
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to relax
before the competition.

297
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,028
Sorry, sister, I got my own problems.

298
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,998
Fuck you!

299
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,715
I'm feeling good, Ari. Let me sit.

300
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,399
- How much we down?
- 200 and fuckin' 70!

301
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,555
We can get that back.

302
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,672
- You'll get thrown out, calm down.
- He's a little upset.

303
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,156
I'll take another marker for 100,000, please.
Thanks, Sam.

304
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,919
So, Ken, did you get to sample
those almonds?

305
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,236
They were terrific, John.
Brought me back to my childhood.

306
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,078
- Yeah, I knew you'd appreciate 'em.
- Oh, crap.

307
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,510
- They must have closed shop early tonight.
- Oh, no.

308
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,437
How about we meet in the morning?

309
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,110
There's no way I can sleep without a rubdown.
Let's take it back to my room.

310
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,910
- Split 'em.
- How much is that?

311
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,918
- 75 grand.
- Now 150.

312
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,230
Gotta do it. Split 'em again.

313
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,953
I once saw a guy split six times straight.

314
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,998
- No choice. Double down.
- Vinnie, that's 300 grand.

315
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,157
- We'll win it back.
- Or my kids go to community college.

316
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,192
I'll take this hand myself if you want.

317
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,357
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

318
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,311
I'd like to split these, please.

319
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,157
- Split kings?
- What's it to you?

320
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,478
- I don't want you fucking up my cards.
- Sir, you have to let him play his way.

321
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,511
- He's playing like a idiot!
- Sir...

322
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,152
- Ari, calm down.
- Relax.

323
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,832
You'll get thrown out of the casino with
300,000 on the table. Calm down.

324
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,073
- Looks like I knew what I was doing.
- No, you took her break card.

325
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,235
Dealer has 11.

326
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,398
Looks like she would've had 21.
I think an apology is in order.

327
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,309
Shoot me and put me out of my fucking misery.

328
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,952
If only it weren't a crime.

329
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,310
Ari, remain positive.
Summon the cards you desire.

330
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,635
Get a higher power from above.
Come on!

331
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,592
- Can't hurt to try.
- Please, God, give us a 10!

332
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,599
Am I getting that apology?

333
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,110
You know what, man? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Come here. Give it to me.

334
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,797
You know, I don't have my table or anything,
Johnny.

335
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,400
That's OK. We can just use the bed, right?

336
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,428
- I guess.
- Cool, I'll go get changed.

337
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,670
Oh, Ken, I got a nice
pineapple-coconut-aloe-vera gel. Is that cool?

338
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,628
What the fuck are you doing, Ken?

339
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,632
Johnny, I have never thought about a man...
in that way.

340
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,912
But the adoration you poured on me today
has made me feel that if...

341
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,349
this is something that you need...

342
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,631
Fuck it, it is Vegas!

343
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,311
Looks like they started already.

344
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,032
No, this is just the pre-show.

345
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,550
We should have a post-show in the suite.
What do you say, Turtle?

346
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,115
I already ordered four bottles of Cristal
and 400 strawberries.

347
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,152
Does money won feel better
than money earned, or am I nuts?

348
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,553
You're nuts.

349
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,036
It's the "We don't drink Jager" crew!
What up, E?

350
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,071
This fucking guy, man.

351
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,554
Did you tell Sloan I said, "What up" again?

352
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,875
No, Seth, I think one time was all she needed.

353
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,992
- What's that mean?
- She said you were obsessed with her.

354
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,395
She doesn't need to feel like you still are.

355
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,193
- She said I was obsessed with her?
- Yeah, sorry.

356
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,390
No, that's OK. No apologies necessary.

357
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,592
In reality, it's more like...
she was obsessed with this.

358
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,154
You know what? Keep fucking dreaming, Seth.

359
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,637
I must have been dreaming about how
I blasted her in the face like a Jackson Pollock.

360
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,628
You got a problem?

361
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,558
- Get your fucking hand off me, man.
- No, but I do!

362
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,677
This ought to be good for your image, Vince.

363
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,389
English
