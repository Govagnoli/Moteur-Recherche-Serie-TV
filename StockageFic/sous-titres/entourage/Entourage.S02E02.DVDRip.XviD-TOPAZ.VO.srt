1
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,305
Wait, don't look.

2
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,705
- I hate this shit.
- Keep them closed!

3
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,734
Drama, hit me again and I'm gonna
beat the shit out of you.

4
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,405
- Turtle did it.
- Bullshit.

5
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,210
I can smell
your Lagerfeld-doused fingers.

6
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,614
- Make a right, right here.
- Where we going?

7
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:27,677
Hold on, take a step now,
step.

8
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,278
Okay, here we come.

9
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:30,949
Steady.

10
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,958
Almost there.

11
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,552
Ready and...

12
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,687
open!

13
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,788
Holy shit!

14
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:42,029
You bought another $100,000 car,
you sick maniac?

15
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,559
No, it's not for me,
it's for you.

16
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,196
It's for me?

17
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,969
Big day for E.
Brand new Maserati,

18
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,976
and you're gonna pop
your cherry tonight.

19
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,671
For your big date
with Kristen,

20
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:54,043
you're gonna need
a nice car.

21
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,014
When finally fucking
your own girlfriend,

22
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,541
one should
travel in style.

23
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,850
God, this is so sweet.

24
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,287
You're gonna love it.

25
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,518
I had an Italian
sports car in '94.

26
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,321
They're a delight.

27
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,328
You had a Fiat,
Drama.

28
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:10,920
Italian,
none the less.

29
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,899
- I can't take this, Vince.
- I'll take it.

30
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:17,801
You've made $6,000 since
you've been my manager.

31
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,702
You're getting killed.
I feel bad.

32
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,037
Do you think this is the right time
to be doing this?

33
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,543
We don't even know when
the next pay day is coming.

34
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,636
You always got
to ruin everything?

35
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,443
All right, fine,
they gave it to me.

36
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,780
- Who gave it to you?
- Beverly Hills Maserati.

37
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,308
I hooked it up.

38
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,753
All they want is for Vince
to be seen riding around town.

39
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,518
Please don't make me beg
you to take a free Maserati.

40
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,721
They gave you this car so you
could be seen driving around in it.

41
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,922
That's why I'm gonna roll down
the window and stick my head out

42
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,227
and you're gonna drive us
to the Laker game.

43
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,401
Oh, look at that!
That's not a foul?

44
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,429
Whatever they are paying you,
I'll double it.

45
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,806
Ed, talk to your boy,
he's gone crazy.

46
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,471
When was the last time you made
a good call? 11 years ago?

47
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,412
- Unbelievable!
- You gotta focus up.

48
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:04,439
I don't know what you're doing,
but you're killing me.

49
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,019
Lamar Odom's got
great calves, huh?

50
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,188
What? He doesn't?

51
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,821
Yeah, Lamar!

52
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,230
Way to go, baby,
way to go!

53
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,858
Big night tonight, huh, E?

54
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,836
You're like a high school girl,
the way you gossip.

55
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,805
- You nervous?
- Yeah, I'm nervous.

56
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,431
I'm saying
I'd be nervous.

57
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,908
Three months your girl's
been glorifying how you perform.

58
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,038
And what if you don't
live up to the memory?

59
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,016
What? We're not talking?

60
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,314
Please.
Who's not talking?

61
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,344
I'm watching the game.
Besides, didn't you fire me?

62
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,219
I fired you?
You're gonna let him interpret?

63
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,088
- He doesn't even speak the language.
- Oh, gosh.

64
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,253
- What did he say again?
- "Do 'Aquaman' or find a new agent."

65
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:52,093
That's what I recall.
Fuck yeah!

66
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:55,294
Get up.
Come on, I paid for the seats.

67
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,929
- Unbelievable.
- Down in front!

68
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,495
I paid two grand
for these seats.

69
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,939
I'll get out there
and launch a three if I want!

70
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,068
All right, look.

71
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,078
I'm making some moves
for you.

72
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,137
I am. We've got some bites.
Don't throw away

73
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,614
- the idea of "Aquaman."
- Ari!

74
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,378
The script
is coming in tomorrow.

75
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,783
I don't want to end up doing
the same role for the rest of my life.

76
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,617
He doesn't want
to get typecast!

77
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,919
Look it. There's "The Joker."
There's "Batman."

78
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,858
There's "Spiderman."
They're all typecast as rich guys.

79
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,225
Listen, for me,
just read the script.

80
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,629
If it's not great,
you'll never hear about it again.

81
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,326
- I promise.
- I'll read the script.

82
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,461
But if I don't like it and you mention
it again, I'm gonna fire you.

83
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:33,028
You want me to interpret
that for you, Ari?

84
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,340
Wow, that sucks.

85
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,505
I can't believe that.

86
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,207
No, no, I understand.

87
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,877
I just... I really wanted
to see you.

88
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,409
No, I understand.

89
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,684
You need anything?

90
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,090
- Vince!
- Yo!

91
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,559
- What's up, Lamar?
- What's up, baby?

92
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,425
- Great game.
- Thanks, man. Good seeing you.

93
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,896
- When you gonna do a new movie?
- Soon, man, soon.

94
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:02,492
Hey, Lamar. What do you do
for your legs, man?

95
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,060
- What?
- How do you get them looking so good?

96
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,038
- Vince, your brother's a freak.
- True.

97
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,870
- Later, man.
- See you, bro.

98
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,376
Johnny, what's up with you
and the legs?

99
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,072
He thinks
his are too thin.

100
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,603
I'm reading
for "Point Dume" tomorrow.

101
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,377
I'm a little stressed.

102
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,749
I'd be more concerned
about your face.

103
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,414
The Chase men
all have great legs.

104
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,423
- Don't forget it.
- No, you're lucky.

105
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,721
You got your mom's calves.
I got Dad's.

106
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,159
Vinnie Chase,
Jaime Pressly.

107
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,526
Hey.
How are you?

108
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,030
Good.
How are you?

109
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,966
I'm mad at you.
We were supposed to work together.

110
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,368
You passed on "Torque."
Remember, baby?

111
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:41,100
Hey, there's always
"Torque 2."

112
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,839
So what are you
up to these days?

113
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,537
Glad you asked.

114
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,637
I am doing a pet project.

115
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,911
I'm gonna have a party at my house
at the beach tonight.

116
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,440
If you guys want to come by,
I can tell you about it.

117
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,782
Of course.

118
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,879
- You're kind of invited, too.
- Thank you.

119
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,549
I would love to show up,

120
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,785
but it's anal sex night
at the Gold house.

121
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,727
Thank you for the invite.
I'm gonna go punish my wife.

122
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,093
- That's nice.
- Good luck, everybody.

123
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,361
Oh, E! Jaime Pressly's
beach party, kid!

124
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,890
Yeah!

125
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,835
- I forgot. You can't come.
- Shut up, Turtle.

126
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,531
This could be
off the hook.

127
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,631
- What's the matter?
- Kristen's got food poisoning.

128
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,370
Ah, no.
You're coming to this party.

129
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,877
Naa, drop me off at home.

130
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,402
It's on the complete
opposite side of town!

131
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,280
Don't be such a fucking pussy!
Oh! Oh!

132
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,285
You know how much gas
a Maserati burns?

133
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,616
Come on.

134
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,554
Oh, he goes to the hoop.

135
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,844
This is a great party!

136
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,714
But we decided
if you're gonna be miserable,

137
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,776
we're gonna be
miserable too.

138
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,082
Just for the record,
I voted against you, E,

139
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,884
but I went
with the majority.

140
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,552
I'm not miserable. I'm pissed I got
stuck with a $400 hotel room.

141
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,460
Peninsula has a 24-hour
cancellation policy.

142
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,623
You should at least go
jerk off on the bed.

143
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:13,893
You gotta pay for it.

144
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,901
Let me
get this straight.

145
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,098
She convinces you to get
these extravagant accommodations

146
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,402
and then she bails?

147
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,069
She didn't bail.
She got sick.

148
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,271
Before the date.
Unlike your girls,

149
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:27,836
who get sick
when they arrive.

150
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,643
Uh-huh,
Uh-huh.

151
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,082
Right, right.

152
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,143
You don't believe her?

153
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,678
I didn't buy
the period.

154
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,280
Yeah,
I didn't either.

155
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,786
You, too?

156
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:46,265
Don't beat around
the bush anymore.

157
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,062
The three of us
can't stand her.

158
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,795
Okay?
We never could.

159
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,667
Really?

160
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,365
I don't like the way
she treats you.

161
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,374
Face facts, E.

162
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,603
She didn't come to New York.
One day she got her period.

163
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,668
Next day
she got food poisoning.

164
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,306
She's fucking somebody else.

165
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,517
Easy, Turtle.

166
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,543
That's my girlfriend.

167
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,323
Christ.

168
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,624
Look at the tree trunks
on that guy.

169
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,029
Catch you guys later.

170
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,439
Hey!

171
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:33,072
So, I don't get it.
It's a "spec-telethon"?

172
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,945
Yeah, you know,
like Jerry Lewis does for M.S.

173
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,950
But for dogs?

174
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,474
Yeah, you like dogs,
don't you?

175
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,283
Well, of course.
I just didn't know they had M.S.

176
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,447
Well, they do,

177
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,252
and we can help them.

178
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:49,227
- Mm-hmm.
- Imagine if we hosted it together.

179
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,729
How hot would that be?

180
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,424
Quite.

181
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,399
- Yeah.
- So, will you do it?

182
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,526
Sure, of course.

183
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,400
I just have to talk
to my people.

184
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,429
Dogs need people
to talk for them.

185
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,441
Huh.

186
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,443
Sorry to interrupt
you guys.

187
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,240
Oh, here's
my people now.

188
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,770
I'm gonna grab a cab.
Thank you very much. See you.

189
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,008
- Wait. No!
- Yeah.

190
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,311
E, come on,
hang out.

191
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,113
I don't want to.
I'm tired, I want to go home.

192
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:16,246
- I'm gonna go to sleep.
- Okay. Yo, everybody!

193
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,586
- Stop, stop!
- Listen up!

194
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,421
My friend here E is
trying to bounce!

195
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,757
Could you convince him
to stay, maybe?

196
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,995
Leanna, Leanna!

197
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,865
- Have you met my boy, E?
- No. Hi.

198
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,496
- Nice to meet you.
- Leanna is a "Perfect 10" model.

199
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:35,200
You know what that means...
"Au natural."

200
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,266
Can you believe that,
with those tits?

201
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,868
Oh my God,
E's "au natural" too.

202
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,310
He wants to leave.
Can you believe that?

203
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,904
Why?

204
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,939
I'm just tired.
Want to go home and go to sleep.

205
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,644
That's too bad.

206
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,577
So, what is it you do, E?

207
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,283
Uh, well,
I work with Vince a little bit.

208
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,054
- Very cool.
- He works with me. He's my manager.

209
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,459
He runs my life.
I'd be nowhere without him.

210
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,122
Even cooler.

211
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,758
Come on,
I'll take care of you,

212
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,031
make sure nothing
bad happens.

213
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,772
- Thanks.
- Nice work.

214
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,503
I work with Vince a lot.

215
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,306
I take care
of whatever he needs.

216
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,040
Like a gopher?

217
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,877
No, sweetheart.

218
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,439
It's more like
a manager.

219
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,418
Why, you looking
for representation?

220
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,756
What's up?

221
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,826
Huh?

222
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,097
You keep staring.
What's up?

223
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,095
Oh, uh, I was just...

224
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,102
Can I ask you
a question?

225
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,974
Yeah, what?

226
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,846
Are those real?
Or are they implants?

227
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,009
What?

228
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,542
Your calves, bro.

229
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,111
What, are you joking?

230
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,022
Okay,
keep it to yourself.

231
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,958
But if you're telling me
they're real,

232
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,984
I ain't buying it.

233
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,490
Hers neither.

234
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,263
All I'm saying is that
from a girl's point of view,

235
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,701
if she wanted
to see you,

236
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,729
she would've asked you
to bring her some soup.

237
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:20,641
So, what kind of dog
is your dog?

238
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,705
He's a rottweiler.
He's beautiful.

239
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:26,309
Oh, yeah,
that's not gonna work.

240
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,979
You know what?

241
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,148
Maybe we can get you
like a Chihuahua,

242
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,591
and we'll pretend
like that's your dog. Perfect!

243
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,255
Good thing she ain't
driving home.

244
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,593
Let's go swimming.

245
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,599
Are you kidding?
It's fucking freezing.

246
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,498
- I'll keep you warm.
- Really?

247
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,162
- Absolutely.
- Promise?

248
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,171
- Live a little, come on!
- Okay.

249
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,140
- Let's go swimming!
- Are you out of your mind?

250
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,439
Come on,
Vince's manager!

251
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,672
Oh, it's on, baby!

252
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,142
Come on.

253
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,556
Come on, E.

254
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,355
Even if she still is
your girlfriend,

255
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,954
it's not cheating
if you're not in love.

256
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,898
Just don't fall in love
with me, okay?

257
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,439
You coming?

258
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,035
No, have fun, bro.

259
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,308
I don't want anyone
to see my legs.

260
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,557
Hello.

261
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,120
Hey! Are you up?

262
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,793
Uh, yeah, barely.

263
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,701
I feel so much better.
I want to see you.

264
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,799
Now?

265
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,935
- It's 7:30 in the morning.
- Check out is not till noon.

266
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,946
I called.
Meet me over there.

267
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,847
No! I'm not allowed
to go to the Peninsula.

268
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:07,410
I had a fight with them last night
and I'm gonna dispute the charges.

269
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,512
Oh, well,
meet me here then.

270
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,080
You know what, I can't.
I got a crazy morning.

271
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,888
God, I thought you were
dying to see me.

272
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,191
Well, I am.

273
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,094
My last class is at 3:00.

274
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,326
Pick me up outside
the James building.

275
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,762
Hello?

276
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,635
Yeah.

277
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:27,969
Uh, are you okay?

278
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:31,807
Yeah, I'm okay.
See you at 3:00.

279
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,471
Okay.

280
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,139
I'm sorry about last night.

281
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,809
I miss you.

282
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,317
Miss you, too.

283
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,750
- Girlfriend?
- Yep.

284
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,757
Who's Rob?
Your boyfriend?

285
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,089
How did you guess?

286
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,721
I gotta go.

287
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,890
Oh, please.

288
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,630
I've never been
with a guy

289
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,069
that didn't want
to fuck me again in the morning.

290
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,678
- Deny till you die.
- That's all I'm saying.

291
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,875
"I don't know what you're talking about.
It never happened."

292
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,746
E, Look at me.

293
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,116
"Kristen, I've never
cheated on you in my life."

294
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,747
- That was good, right, Vince?
- Yeah, excellent.

295
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,086
- Very believable.
- E?

296
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,057
I'd work on your audition,
Drama.

297
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:23,152
It's not gonna be about the acting,
bro, trust me.

298
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:29,724
Sir, could you please
take your hands off the mirror?

299
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,898
What do you think?

300
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,998
Nothing says "I cheated" more
than an expensive piece of jewelry.

301
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,872
I'm gonna tell her,
so what's the difference?

302
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,571
No!

303
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,045
Let's hope she forgives me.

304
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,513
Don't you listen to a word
we say?

305
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,914
I agree with these guys.
You're making a mistake.

306
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,781
All this coming from a guy
who's never had

307
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,684
a relationship
that's lasted longer than a week.

308
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,313
What, and that's an insult?

309
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:53,382
You tell someone you cheated
if you want to break up with them.

310
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,189
Otherwise, it's a selfish way
to get rid of your guilt.

311
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,855
- Well said.
- Thank you.

312
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,660
You tell her,
she'll never trust you again.

313
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,189
If you want to stay with Kristen,
you keep your mouth shut

314
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,225
- and you don't do it again.
- Exactly.

315
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,760
None of this
would have happened

316
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,601
if you guys didn't put it
in my head she was cheating.

317
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,267
Don't blame us
'cause you're weak!

318
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,866
I'll take the blame
for last night,

319
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,470
but you banging her again this morning.
That's on you.

320
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,173
Who said I did?

321
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:19,649
- What?
- She was really hot.

322
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:20,811
So?

323
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,514
She was the hottest girl
you ever been with.

324
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,283
- Ever.
- Kristen's not hot?

325
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:27,781
Kristen's cute in that
"I want to marry you

326
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,384
so I can divorce you
some day" way.

327
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,192
But that girl last night...
she could start wars.

328
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:35,223
She was Vince hot.
You ain't never had Vince hot.

329
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,327
Vince and I used to compete for girls
in high school. He didn't always win.

330
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,304
I let him have
Gina DeBernardo

331
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,170
when he got cut
from the baseball team.

332
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,573
Take away your fame,
we're still competing and you know it.

333
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,408
Either way, no girls in high school
were that hot.

334
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,006
So just tell us.
Did you fuck her this morning or not?

335
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,213
Uh, how much is this one?

336
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,483
It's $1,400.

337
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,821
Okay, I'll take it.

338
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,383
- He fucked her.
- Definitely.

339
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,861
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

340
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,425
Hey, Ari.

341
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,198
Where are you guys?
I gotta see you now.

342
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,865
I got gold in my hands, baby.
Fucking gold.

343
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,306
We're on our way
to Burke Williams.

344
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:20,301
Say the words
"Chiang Kai-Shek."

345
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,314
You will get a happy ending.
I'm not kidding.

346
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,975
I'll be right there.

347
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,608
- He's meeting us.
- Why?

348
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,312
I have no idea.

349
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,514
Turtle, roll with me.
Come on.

350
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,887
As usual,
I get fucked out of the steam.

351
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,792
So you're done
with that girl?

352
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,462
Of course I'm done with her.
It was a one-night mistake.

353
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,233
- You're not gonna call her again?
- I'm not gonna call her.

354
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,365
Hmm, interesting.

355
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,342
I think
I'm gonna call her.

356
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,646
"I'm like the tide, baby.
I come and go as I please."

357
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:03,310
Okay, that was great,
Johnny.

358
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,381
- Really great.
- We just need to see the legs now.

359
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,035
You're not
fucking calling her.

360
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,631
What are you being
so territorial about?

361
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,437
- She has a boyfriend.
- That's sweet.

362
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,239
You should buy him
expensive jewelry.

363
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:27,711
"Fade in. Arthur Curry,

364
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,715
A.K.A. Aquaman,
the heir to the throne of Poseidon,

365
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,684
is being placed gently
on a barrier reef by his father."

366
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,550
- You're kidding me?
- I'm not kidding.

367
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,384
I'm gonna read
this entire script.

368
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,754
You know why?
It's that good.

369
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,850
Andrew Kevin Walker
wrote it.

370
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,088
- The guy who wrote "Seven"?
- Yeah.

371
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:46,029
Anyone who puts Gwyneth's head
in a box is okay by me.

372
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,625
Still bitter, huh?
After all these years?

373
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,032
You know what?
I fired her.

374
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,469
"As Arthur's father stares
into his Son's eyes,

375
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,530
- he pours the Serum X..."
- Ari, we'll read it.

376
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,542
- You're gonna read it tonight?
- I'll read it.

377
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,009
- You promise?
- I promise.

378
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,375
You're not lying to me?

379
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,902
I said I'll read it,
I'll read it.

380
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,312
Because it would be
a very big lie.

381
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:06,806
And one lie begats another,
and it's a slippery slope.

382
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,685
- You fucking told him?
- I didn't tell him.

383
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,087
- Jaime told me.
- Jaime told him.

384
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,955
You commit to do
the dog telethon?

385
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:17,223
I wouldn't exactly call it
a commitment.

386
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,230
Will you watch your boy?
It does not help his career

387
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,959
to do 24 hours
on the "Animal Planet."

388
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,524
And by the way, E,
I happen to know Leanna.

389
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,470
My God, she is way too hot
for you, man.

390
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:27,802
What'd you roofy her up?

391
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,740
I didn't know
you had it in you.

392
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,209
Honestly, I don't.
I'm sick over it.

393
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,372
He bought Kristen jewelry
and he's confessing tonight.

394
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,780
No confessions.
Did you read the papers, you idiot?

395
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,443
Did you hear about this guy?

396
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,248
He confessed to a murder
in 1973 with no clues.

397
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,754
They're gonna give him 25 years.
Shut your mouth.

398
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,586
Do not say a word,
or you will end up

399
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,455
being gang-banged
by a bunch of cholos.

400
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,324
Just relax.
It's Hollywood, baby.

401
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,829
- Everyone strays sometimes.
- Does your wife?

402
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,798
That's the mother
of my kids.

403
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,891
Don't be an asshole.

404
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,914
- Hey. How are you?
- Hey.

405
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,585
Wanna get
a cup of coffee?

406
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:25,085
No. I want to go straight
to my apartment.

407
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,836
Three months is a long time
to be away, huh?

408
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,277
It's not that long.

409
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,110
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

410
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:46,311
'Cause I was starting to feel
like this was never gonna happen.

411
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,182
Why wouldn't this happen?

412
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,018
Well, you know,
the period.

413
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:54,253
And you not coming
to see me in New York.

414
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,851
I don't know.

415
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:59,261
I felt like everything
was working against us.

416
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,698
The guys were convinced
you were blowing me off.

417
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,793
You're 28 years old.

418
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,770
Do you have to listen
to everything

419
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,638
that Peter Pan and the Lost Boys
have to say?

420
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,109
No, but they can be
persuasive.

421
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,907
And then you got
food poisoning.

422
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,743
What?

423
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,612
You don't think
I had food poisoning?

424
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,640
No, I believe you,
I'm just saying,

425
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,620
my friends thought
it was a little, you know, weird.

426
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,383
Well, what are you saying?

427
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,550
Are you accusing me
of something?

428
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,219
No.

429
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,855
Okay,
just stop guilting me.

430
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,592
God...

431
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,192
I thought that I could
go through with this

432
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,100
and let the past
be the past.

433
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,570
But I can't.

434
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:43,734
I was with someone
when you were away.

435
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:46,073
Oh, fuck.
God, I knew it.

436
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,409
That's why you were
being weird this morning?

437
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,678
But, come on.
You were in New York for three months.

438
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,208
- You weren't with anyone?
- No.

439
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,051
You were in Manhattan
and the Hamptons with Vince.

440
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,217
You're gonna tell me girls weren't
throwing themselves all over you.

441
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,419
I thought we had
an agreement.

442
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,722
No, we didn't.

443
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,559
That's what you wanted
but I said I wasn't sure.

444
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,031
Really? I must've missed that
in between all the calls

445
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,624
of you telling me
how much you missed me.

446
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,761
I can't believe this.
I'm so stupid.

447
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,100
No, you're not.

448
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,106
I'm stupid.
You're a great guy.

449
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,506
Who's the other great guy?

450
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:20,204
Just somebody
I met in class.

451
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,579
Were you with him
last night?

452
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,846
Or did you really have
food poisoning?

453
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:29,046
- Oh, God.
- Eric, please.

454
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,181
I'm sorry.
I don't want it to end like this.

455
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,188
I didn't come here
to accuse you of anything.

456
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,994
I came over here
to confess.

457
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,558
I would have rather of been
with you, but last night

458
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,002
I got drunk and fucked
a "Perfect Ten" model.

459
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,232
And, uh...

460
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:49,433
I fucked her again
this morning.

461
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,465
See you later.

462
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,513
- All right, so you confessed?
- Yeah.

463
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,983
That's not confessing,

464
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,043
that's rubbing it in her face!
Good for you!

465
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,486
You should have
held out,

466
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,355
made her stew in her own guilt
until it broke her.

467
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,520
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

468
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:12,257
I really am.
It's just that...

469
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:15,061
last night, she was the hottest girl
I've ever been with.

470
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,001
I didn't get to enjoy it,
because I felt guilty.

471
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,936
What about this morning?

472
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,802
Did you enjoy yourself
this morning?

473
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:26,809
Well, I told Kristen I did.

474
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,710
- I fucking knew it, baby!
- Pay up.

475
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,772
Pay up, bro.
Cash only.

476
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,374
But, I didn't.

477
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:35,409
What did I tell you?
Do I know my boy

478
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,649
or do I know my boy?
"Hundy spot."

479
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,351
I'm wearing sweats,
bro.

480
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,189
My wallet is
in the car.

481
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,854
Forget it.

482
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:46,591
Why don't you call Leanna
tonight?

483
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,223
Take her out.
You're a free man now.

484
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:49,927
No, man,
forget that girl.

485
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,300
Only reason she was with me
was 'cause I'm your manager.

486
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:55,272
So? You know how much pussy
I got in this town I didn't deserve?

487
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:56,433
All of it.

488
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,443
Look, E...

489
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,707
sometimes your position
in life allows you

490
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,043
to get things
you never could've had.

491
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,707
That doesn't mean
it's not right.

492
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,683
And it doesn't mean
it's gonna last.

493
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,345
So now that this whole
Kristen thing is finally finished,

494
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,447
it's about time you started
to enjoy yourself a little.

495
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,822
Or at least fake it,
so we can.

496
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,590
You know, we could all be
working for the phone company.

497
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,597
All of us.

498
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,599
What the fuck does
that mean?

499
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,568
Think about it, E.
Think about it.

500
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,833
Hey, guys, why don't we go
to Vegas tonight

501
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,840
and have a wild,
decadent time.

502
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:31,502
Forget that you got dumped.
Forget that I don't have a job.

503
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,909
Forget that he's got
Shawn Bradley's legs.

504
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,242
I'm trying
to enjoy myself.

505
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,645
- You wanna go?
- I want to go.

506
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,273
Just gotta make
a quick cash stop.

507
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,884
- Vegas, baby.
- Let's do it!

508
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,286
Aw, so, what's wrong?

509
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:47,621
- She didn't like it?
- Actually, I decided I didn't like her.

510
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,786
Oh...

511
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,060
So, are you an actor, too?

512
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,258
Like Vince?

513
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:55,857
- No.
- No.

514
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,534
Actually...

515
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,402
yeah,
I'm Vince's manager.

516
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:03,871
Oh.

517
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,688
- Phone number!
- Yeah!

518
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,149
- Nice move!
- Get out, I'm driving.

519
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,829
You're the man.

520
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,130
Vegas, baby!

521
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,998
- Whoo!
- Vegas.
