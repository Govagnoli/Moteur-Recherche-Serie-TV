1
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,306
What's up?

2
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,808
It is 9:30! Do you know
where your only client is?

3
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,914
Testing out the new emergency
asshole system, Ari?

4
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:32,925
Vince missed his physical
this morning.

5
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,927
No physical,
no insurance.

6
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:36,724
No insurance,
no movie.

7
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,822
Yeah, I know all about it.
I'm handling it.

8
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,799
- When?
- As soon as he resurfaces.

9
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,734
Nice "Aquaman" lingo.
At least one of you

10
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,464
is committed to this
fucking movie.

11
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,598
- Bye, Ari.
- Hey, take this seriously, E.

12
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,299
Got MILF?

13
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,938
- Thank you.
- Superhero or no superhero,

14
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,914
it's downright rude
to be this tardy.

15
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,144
- Maybe we should get him a driver.
- He's got a driver.

16
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,675
It's not my fault. I'm on call,
but I need to be called.

17
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,187
Besides,
he coulda took a cab.

18
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,689
Nobody takes cabs
in L.A., Turtle.

19
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,714
'Cause no one can figure out
what color they are.

20
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,953
They got blue ones, green ones,
red ones, white ones.

21
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:10,519
Fuck a city where the cabs aren't
monochromatic yellow.

22
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:13,031
- Uh-huh.
- Here he is.

23
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,693
Oh, hey, Aquaman.

24
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,532
- Mandy finally let you out of her web?
- Sorry I'm late.

25
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,198
You know how hard it is
to break away from a good spooning.

26
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,901
- What are we eating?
- We already ate.

27
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,535
Just for the record,
I took the liberty of ordering you

28
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,977
- this beautiful egg white frittata.
- Where is it?

29
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,913
E had 'em clear it.

30
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:31,610
In all fairness, the cheese
was starting to congeal.

31
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,710
That's what happens
when you leave your breakfast

32
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,345
- sitting on the table for 45 minutes.
- I get it.

33
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,652
I shouldn't have kept
you guys waiting. I'm sorry.

34
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,282
No, you don't get it.
You fucked up.

35
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,725
- You missed your physical.
- Oh, fuck.

36
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,821
I totally forgot.
We overslept.

37
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,560
You're gonna have 4:00 A.M. Call times.
Those gonna be a problem?

38
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,194
- No, no problem.
- Scout's honor.

39
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:53,433
- So, what else?
- You got weapons instruction at 2:00.

40
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,498
You're gonna learn how
to use Aquaman's claw.

41
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:56,941
Sweet!

42
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,973
- What?
- Maybe now's not a good time to ask,

43
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,950
but I kind of told Mandy
I'd go house-hunting with her.

44
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,282
Anyway, we can
push it back, right?

45
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,811
- Just an hour.
- Come on, don't be irresponsible.

46
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,619
Irresponsible?

47
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,649
You know, maybe we should
pick up the Maserati

48
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,161
before we all start
saying things we regret.

49
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,187
- Where's the Maserati?
- Police impound.

50
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,563
Got stolen right in front
of Nacional last night.

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,229
Guy loses a $100,000 car,
which I gave him,

52
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,738
and he's calling me
irresponsible.

53
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,972
Barbara Miller's
on the phone for you.

54
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,570
- She's Mandy Moore's agent.
- I know who the fuck she is.

55
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,673
Go get me a kava berry shake
with a pinch of bee pollen,

56
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,116
all right, Lloyd?
What do you got, Babs?

57
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,211
I got a giant fucking migraine
is what I got.

58
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,745
I'll give you one
of my famous shoulder massages.

59
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,054
- You remember those from the old days?
- I do, Ari.

60
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,560
I also remember you threatened
to sue me for sexual harassment

61
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,119
right before I fired you.

62
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,825
- Didn't we settle out of court?
- Enough flirting, Ari.

63
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,766
- I want you to listen the fuck up.
- What's the problem?

64
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,770
The problem is your client
Vincent Chase

65
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,272
is about to destroy
10 years of my hard work.

66
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,400
I need some face-to-face
before this gets ugly.

67
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,537
- I'll wear something clingy.
- You do that.

68
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,706
I'm telling you, once
your car's been stolen,

69
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,409
it never runs
the same again.

70
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,315
It's like a guy sleeping
with your girl.

71
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,819
He leaves his mark
all over her.

72
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,821
And how does a car
know it's been stolen?

73
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,982
Ask the Buddhists, bro.

74
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,323
They believe everything's got a soul,
even a toaster oven.

75
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:25,161
- Say, Shauna, what's up?
- Break out your composition notebook,

76
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:29,294
and I want you to write 1,000 times
"I promise to control my client."

77
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,428
- What now?
- This week's "Us Weekly"...

78
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,735
three-page spread
of Vince and Mandy,

79
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,970
including pictures of them
massaging produce at Bristol Farms.

80
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,877
I told you Vince wasn't gonna
let the press control his life.

81
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,039
- Pictures were inevitable.
- Fuck you, Eric.

82
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,776
These look like
they're posing for them.

83
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,943
Didn't I say fucking
soy milk, Christy? Come on!

84
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,714
Soy milk's got more fat
than regular milk...

85
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,278
Don't be a wise-ass.

86
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,347
It's the other line, Shauna,
Be well. Hey.

87
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,951
- Hey, idiot.
- Hey, what's up, asshole?

88
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,927
Listen, I know about
the "Us Weekly" pictures.

89
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,862
- I'm not worried.
- What does worry you, Eric?

90
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:59,762
You're just so fucking
calm, so poised,

91
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,233
- it makes me want to smack you.
- Go for it. I gotta go.

92
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,133
I'm not calling about
"Us Weekly" pictures.

93
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,138
- Be here in 30 minutes.
- Why? What's up?

94
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:09,039
We're going to hell,
so bring your sunblock.

95
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,105
Sir, how long is
this gonna take?

96
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,477
Five minutes less than
when you asked last time.

97
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,981
I need the keys
to the Hummer.

98
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,040
- Where are you running?
- I got a meeting with Ari.

99
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,642
- About what?
- Who the fuck knows?

100
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,984
I'll meet you at Warners'.
Make sure he's on time.

101
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,319
You're being very hard
on me today, E.

102
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,462
- Hey, Lloyd.
- Wrong way, Eric.

103
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,158
Today we're in the war room.
Follow me.

104
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,599
- War room?
- It's really just a conference room,

105
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,069
but Ari likes to refer
to it as "the war room."

106
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,731
Makes him feel
like a gladiator.

107
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,172
- Everybody's waiting for you.
- Who's everybody?

108
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,267
Mandy's people,
and they don't look happy.

109
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,278
But don't worry,
I got you your favorite...

110
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,110
- Mrs. Beasley's chocolate chip muffins.
- Thanks, Lloyd.

111
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:52,015
Little memory trick when they
introduce themselves... word association.

112
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,916
Like, you say "Eric Murphy"
and I think, "loser."

113
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,750
- Like "Ari Gold"..."douchebag"?
- Mm-hmm.

114
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,780
Hey everybody, this is
Vinnie's manager Eric Murphy.

115
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,020
Say hello to Mandy's
manager Phyllis,

116
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,426
Mandy's music agent Mark,

117
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,488
Mandy's publicist Stan,

118
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,694
her attorney Jeff,
her music manager Craig,

119
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,794
and most importantly,
her theatrical agent

120
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,328
and one of my earliest mentors
Barbara Miller.

121
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,467
So, Ari, who's gonna be
running this shindig, you or me?

122
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,876
You've got the biggest cock in the room,
Babs. Why don't you kick it off?

123
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,470
Oh, I don't know
about that, Ari.

124
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,641
We haven't seen Eric's yet.

125
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,354
Yo, Vince, this shit
is hot. Who is it?

126
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,059
- No clue.
- Sounds like Eminem to me.

127
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,624
What do you know
about hip hop, Drama?

128
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,330
Are you crazy, bro?
I'm O.G.

129
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,999
O. G? The last
hip-hop CD you bought

130
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,235
was the Kid 'N Play
box set.

131
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,335
- So who is it then?
- I never heard it before.

132
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,572
Yeah, me neither.

133
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,343
Since when does E
listen to rap music?

134
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,475
"Saigon."
Four tracks.

135
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,952
- It's a demo?
- No way that's E's.

136
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,854
He knows as much about
the rap music business as Willie Nelson.

137
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,687
So this idiot thief
forgot his demo?

138
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,784
How lazy could this guy be?

139
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,658
It's got his address
and his phone number on it.

140
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,287
We should call the cops.

141
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,525
This Saigon could be
a three-strike offender.

142
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,090
We could put him away for life.

143
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:18,331
Oh yeah, you are
truly O.G., Johnny.

144
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:26,578
Yo, Vince, think about this song
for the end of "QB"

145
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,513
you on the screen,
the rain pouring down.

146
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,017
You say "I am
Queens Boulevard"...bang,

147
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,019
this song comes on.

148
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:37,079
That's a good idea, Turtle.
I'll call Walsh, set up the meeting.

149
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,717
Yeah? Yeah,
I'll go with you.

150
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,956
Uh, no, you go alone. No way I'm telling
Walsh how to score his movie.

151
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,792
That guy's crazy.

152
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,459
So, Vince miss meetings
a lot, Eric?

153
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,264
- No, not really.
- 'Cause Mandy doesn't miss meetings.

154
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,930
Mandy doesn't ever
miss meetings.

155
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,598
- Cool.
- In fact...

156
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,732
Mandy hasn't missed
a meeting in 15 years.

157
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,903
- She's never even been late.
- Once, but that was during the riots.

158
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:02,073
Wow. Sounds like you have
a tremendously punctual client.

159
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,741
This is not fucking funny, Eric.

160
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,081
No it's not. So why don't you
tell me why I'm here?

161
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,177
You're here because
Vince isn't the only one

162
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,951
who missed a meeting today.
Mandy did too.

163
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,049
What are you saying?
Vince is a bad influence?

164
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,787
Eric, we both know

165
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,193
Vince has fucked
half the actresses in this town.

166
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,028
Mandy, on the other hand,
is a good girl.

167
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,864
You gonna sit there and let them
bad-mouth Vince like this?

168
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,928
- Thought that was a compliment.
- Nobody's bad-mouthing Vince.

169
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,940
- Yeah, we love Vince.
- Vince is adorable.

170
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,340
They're just asking you,
as his personal manager,

171
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:33,607
to get Vince to put this relationship
on hold until the movie's over.

172
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,945
Ari, the guy's in love. He's not going
to put his relationship on hold.

173
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,213
But I promise you he will be
where he needs to be.

174
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:42,312
You guys do the same thing
with Mandy and we'll be fine.

175
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,448
Okay? We done?
Nice meeting you.

176
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,525
Eric.

177
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,357
You don't want to wind up
spinning dough

178
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,329
at that fucking
pizza place again, do you?

179
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,223
Told her a little bit
about you.

180
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,338
Listen, Babs,

181
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,465
you don't want
to talk to me like that.

182
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:04,340
'Cause I don't care who you are.
Yes, I am Vince's manager,

183
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,175
but we've also been best friends
since we were six years old

184
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,181
and I don't appreciate
sitting in a room

185
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,616
discussing his personal life
with a bunch of fuckin' strangers.

186
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,888
- Eric...
- You sandbag me like that me again,

187
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,118
we're gonna have
a big fuckin' problem.

188
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,023
We have a big fuckin'
problem right now!

189
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,425
If you don't take
this seriously

190
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,190
the whole fuckin' movie's
gonna go down in flames.

191
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,289
- I told you I had it under control.
- Really?

192
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,095
- Yeah.
- I didn't tell you this.

193
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,432
- Tell me what?
- This stays between the two of us.

194
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:33,734
- Speak, Ari!
- You have to take this seriously.

195
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,139
You can't tell Vince,
'cause it will freak him out.

196
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,143
You promise me?

197
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,475
- I promise.
- All right.

198
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,879
James Cameron called.

199
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,009
- And?
- He said that Vince can be replaced.

200
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,224
- Going down?
- It looks like we all are.

201
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,501
Look, I'm sorry about
that pizza remark.

202
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,366
Sorry I came back
at you so hard.

203
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,633
You were just doing what
you were supposed to do.

204
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:09,300
- Protecting your client, right?
- That's right.

205
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,469
So who else
do you represent, Eric?

206
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,943
Oh, right.
Just Vince.

207
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,674
You want to start
in again, Barbara?

208
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,615
My point is
I have 100 clients.

209
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,845
So if I'm this worried
about one of 100,

210
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:22,752
how worried should you
be about one of one?

211
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,120
That's some apology,
Barbara.

212
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,867
- Hey, Billy.
- Oh!

213
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,436
What, did the kids
run away from home?

214
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,211
I'll call the front desk.
I'll have them send up a futon.

215
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,845
- We're not here for a sleepover, Bill.
- Oh, really?

216
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,514
Well what are you
here for then?

217
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,251
I'm here to get a couple
of my scenes put back in the movie.

218
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,156
I got a hot song
for "Queens Boulevard."

219
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:04,754
Thanks, but no thanks. I'm scoring
the whole thing myself with a sitar.

220
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,424
- What else?
- Come on, Billy.

221
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,729
You know the studio ain't
gonna release the movie

222
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,235
with that music
you had in at Sundance.

223
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,066
You need a bangin'
soundtrack.

224
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,696
I don't give a fuck
if they release it.

225
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,707
All I care about is if it's
the best movie it could be.

226
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,936
You put my liquor store
meltdown scene back in,

227
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,343
you get an Independent
Spirit Award guaranteed.

228
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,347
Guys, I got a busy day.

229
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,848
- Just give it a listen.
- No.

230
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,283
- Why not?
- Because I already picked the songs.

231
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,115
I don't want my
head getting confused.

232
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,123
Billy, I know music.
All right? Trust me.

233
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,588
All right, but I want
Johnny's watch.

234
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,328
What?

235
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,763
No problem.
Give him your watch.

236
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,767
I ain't givin' him my watch.

237
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,362
I'll put the liquor store scene back in
and I'll listen to the song.

238
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,134
Deal.

239
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,780
I was gonna put
that scene back in anyway.

240
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,807
Now play your
funky music, white boy.

241
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:20,995
I love it.

242
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,102
End titles.

243
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,111
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

244
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:29,205
We got $10,000 left for music,
that's it. Who owns the rights?

245
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:36,386
Great job, Turtle. You just sold
a song you don't own.

246
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,390
You know what my pops
used to say?

247
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,392
"I wish I had a daughter"?

248
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,394
No. "Sell it,
don't smell it."

249
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,089
Don't worry,
we'll get the rights.

250
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,496
- How?
- We'll wing it, my man.

251
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,341
What the fuck is the matter
with you, Vince?

252
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,409
That's the 17th whale
you've killed today.

253
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,182
They're the biggest targets, Dale.

254
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,655
Yes, and they are also
Aquaman's biggest friends.

255
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,250
You kill the whales
and then all you've got left

256
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,591
is a pod
of pissed-off sharks.

257
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,894
An hour late.
Must have been some meeting.

258
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,423
- Yeah. How's it going in here?
- Not going worth a shit.

259
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,596
The boy here has killed more whales
than the Japanese fishing fleet.

260
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,697
- This thing is impossible.
- You gotta focus.

261
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,174
- You don't think I'm focused?
- You killed 17 whales?

262
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,269
And three dolphins...
also Aquaman amigos.

263
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,611
- Jesus.
- It's a fucking claw, E!

264
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,550
They just invented this.
Nobody's ever used this before.

265
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,985
Stop crying. I'm gonna get
some more harpoons.

266
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,616
All right, E.

267
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,683
What's up?

268
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,421
Obviously something
has upset you.

269
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:52,157
A lot of people are upset
you missed your physical.

270
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,133
- What people? Ari?
- No, Mandy's people too.

271
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,034
- They were there? Why?
- They think you're a bad influence.

272
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,163
Me? It was her alarm clock
that didn't go off.

273
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,901
- Come, on Vince, really.
- No, you come on.

274
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:05,274
You actually sat in a meeting
and discussed my personal life?

275
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,610
No, as soon as I figured out what they
wanted, I told them all to fuck off.

276
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,274
You told Barbara Miller
to fuck off?

277
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,443
Yeah. Nobody talks shit
about you except me.

278
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:15,112
Good looking out, E.

279
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,645
- Are we in this together?
- Of course we are.

280
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,056
You promise me you're not
gonna fuck up this movie?

281
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,583
E, I wouldn't fuck up
my career over a girl.

282
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,188
Any girl. Never.

283
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,698
You believe me, right?

284
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,700
Yeah.

285
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,100
- But...
- But what?

286
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,627
- You still seem a little freaked out.
- No, I'm good.

287
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,333
E?

288
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,106
- I shouldn't tell you this.
- No, come on, E,

289
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:42,011
we don't hold shit back
from each other, remember?

290
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,982
- Ari made me promise.
- So you crossed your fingers, right?

291
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,611
- Yeah, of course.
- So what is it?

292
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,644
- Cameron called this morning.
- And?

293
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:52,452
He said you can
be replaced.

294
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,262
This is crazy
coming down here not strapped.

295
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,238
You don't even
own a gun, Drama.

296
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,241
I don't need a gun,
Turtle.

297
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,243
All I needed
was my nunchucks,

298
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,904
but you wouldn't
stop by the house.

299
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,072
Why? So you're gonna walk
down Slauson Boulevard

300
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,344
with nunchucks stickin'
out of your back pocket?

301
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:20,284
No, I would have concealed them
in my Frye boots.

302
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,879
Your pants are so taped
you'd never be able to get 'em out.

303
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,857
- Look how tight these things are.
- Get off 'em.

304
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:29,327
- Yo, this is it.
- 345.

305
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,708
Just so you know,

306
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:47,644
if anything goes down,
it's every man for himself.

307
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,048
What are you two selling?

308
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,060
We're... uh, we're
looking for Saigon?

309
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:05,495
You wouldn't happen to be
"Miss Saigon" would you?

310
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,829
Oh, good. Like I've never
heard that shit before.

311
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,356
What you looking
for my son for?

312
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,961
We want to
make him rich.

313
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,302
What are you,
drug dealers?

314
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,467
Oh, no no,
we're music guys.

315
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,975
Actually I'm
an actor, ma'am.

316
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,969
You might have seen me
on "227" back in 1994.

317
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:25,313
It is 3:30 on a Wednesday.
What would my boy be doing home?

318
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,649
Would you mind telling us
where we could find him?

319
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,655
At work.
5577 Rodeo Drive.

320
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,452
Don't you mean
Ro-day-o?

321
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,359
South of Jefferson
it's called Roh-deo.

322
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,226
Stop being so white, Drama.

323
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,767
I just can't believe he'd fire me
because I missed a physical.

324
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,428
Well, it's not just
the physical, Vince.

325
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,937
He knows about
you and Mandy.

326
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,735
I talked to him about me
and Mandy. He gets it.

327
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,469
Well, what do you
want me to tell you?

328
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,636
Tell me why anyone
would bother James Cameron

329
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,475
with the news that
I missed a physical.

330
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,538
Actors reschedule
physicals all the time.

331
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,812
- What can I say, Vince?
- There's nothing to say.

332
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,376
I just...
I don't believe it.

333
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,749
So, what?
You think Ari's lying?

334
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,583
- Hey Lloyd.
- Hey, boys.

335
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,357
Did James Cameron
call this morning?

336
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,331
Um, I was at the dentist
this morning.

337
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,333
- Annual cleaning.
- We'll ask Ari.

338
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,834
Um, he's in a staff meeting.

339
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,860
- We'll wait.
- Thanks, Lloyd.

340
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,633
What's up, player?

341
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,504
- What are you doing?
- Saying hello.

342
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,009
Don't be ignorant,
Turtle.

343
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,103
You can't just waltz
in here and say "hello."

344
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:31,014
You gotta show respect.
Walk the walk and talk the talk.

345
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,950
Where the fuck do you
think we are, Drama?

346
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,010
Trust me, Turtle, this ain't
your neighborhood body shop.

347
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,181
It's a whole 'nother scene.

348
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,315
Hello, gentlemen, I'm Robin.
How can I help you?

349
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,825
How you doin', girl?

350
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:44,420
We're looking for a silky-smooth
rhyming cat named Saigon.

351
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,158
Was that English?

352
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,560
- He's out back.
- Thank you.

353
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,605
Excuse me.
One of you guys Saigon?

354
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,135
That depends.

355
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,681
What you want?

356
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,411
Circular motions will
keep the rag marks off that beast.

357
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,943
We want to talk
to Saigon about this.

358
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,454
Where'd you get that?

359
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,480
Yo, don't sweat it, bro.
We ain't the po-pos.

360
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,185
Who the fuck are
you calling bro?

361
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:17,423
Take it easy, coz. I'm Saigon.
Where'd you get that from?

362
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,192
Found it in our Maserati.

363
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,291
Yeah, the one that was stolen
out in front of Nacional last night?

364
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,768
- Stolen?
- It was Vincent Chase's car.

365
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,361
Vinnie Chase the actor?

366
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,872
- Mm-hmm.
- Shit.

367
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,636
You said it was Steve Berman's
from Interscope, dumbass!

368
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,576
That's what
the motherfucker drives.

369
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,172
How should I know there's
two of the same damn car at one place?

370
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,740
Listen man, we might have dropped
my demo in your car,

371
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,342
but we ain't
take it for a ride.

372
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:41,852
Try selling that
to the judge.

373
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,117
What judge you talking about,
motherfucker?

374
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:47,125
Look, I want to use one of your tracks
in Vince's new movie.

375
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,295
Is there any brothers
in this movie?

376
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,196
Yeah, I think I saw
one in that bar scene.

377
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,167
Man, fuck that. Hold out
for John Singleton's next movie.

378
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,964
I got 10 Gs
for a track, fellas.

379
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:59,971
All right.
You give me that paper,

380
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,235
and you two got
yourself a client.

381
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,742
That is why
y'all here, right?

382
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,243
Y'all want to manage me.

383
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,746
Not me, I got my own
flourishing career to manage.

384
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,181
- Yeah? What you do?
- Tries to act like he isn't retarded.

385
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:15,550
I'm the manager. I'd be thrilled
if you let me represent you.

386
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,782
Yeah, and I'd be thrilled
if I get 10 Gs.

387
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,757
- I hear that.
- What's up?

388
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,362
Uh oh, you boys
look angry.

389
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,194
If there was plastic on the floor
I'd think I was about to be whacked.

390
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,063
Did James Cameron
call you today, Ari?

391
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,064
You promised me
you wouldn't tell.

392
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,301
He crossed his fingers.

393
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,734
You looked me in the face
and you promised.

394
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,245
Did he call?

395
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,748
You little untrustworthy
cocksucker!

396
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:46,876
Yes or no?
Did James Cameron call?

397
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,812
Yes, he did.

398
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,883
And I called E to motivate him
to motivate you.

399
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,158
That was my mistake,
trusting E, and for that I apologize.

400
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,597
- I can't believe it.
- Believe it!

401
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,499
James Cameron cares about
every detail of all of his movies.

402
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,093
- You should call him.
- No, you should not.

403
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,037
You should go back
to doing your job.

404
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,835
- I'm gonna call him.
- Put the phone down.

405
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,933
I'm going to assure him
that I won't ever be late again.

406
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:14,173
- Please, Vinnie, put the phone down.
- Why?

407
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,942
Because, like Mandy,

408
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,506
you have never missed
a meeting before.

409
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,518
That's why this is troubling.

410
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,146
- To Cameron?
- To me!

411
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,349
He didn't call?

412
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,428
- No, he did not call.
- Jesus Christ.

413
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,430
No, you're fucking pathological.

414
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,524
Listen, read Jack Welch,
Tony Robbins, Phil Jackson.

415
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,626
Motivation!
This shit works!

416
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,261
You want to be
Shaq or Kobe?

417
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,204
Michael or Scotty?
Damon or Affleck?

418
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,832
Do you want to be
out of our lives?

419
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,637
'Cause this could seriously
be the end of you.

420
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,803
I am your biggest fan.
I think you are this close

421
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:50,212
to being the biggest movie star
on the planet, but you are slipping.

422
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,910
Over a girl?

423
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,351
I've never seen you like this
before and it worries me.

424
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:58,356
- Worry about yourself. He's fine.
- No, E,

425
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,450
he's right
to worry about me.

426
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,985
You both are.
Fuck, I'm worried about me.

427
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,124
Look at me. I've been lying
to you guys like a fucking drug addict.

428
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:14,104
L... I didn't oversleep.

429
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,107
I didn't want to go.

430
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,666
I never want to leave her side,
not for five seconds.

431
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,513
I've never been like this
in my life, guys.

432
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:23,912
And the truth
of the matter is

433
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,179
I don't even give a fuck
about the movie anymore.

434
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:29,619
I could live with Mandy in a one-bedroom
in Chatsworth and I'd be happy.

435
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,554
It's nuts,
but it's the truth.

436
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,060
- Vinnie...
- No, Ari...

437
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:38,790
there's nothing more to say.
I'm sorry I lied.

438
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,491
Vince!

439
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,537
You think he bought it?

440
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,539
You motherfucker.

441
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,939
- Let him sleep on that.
- Keep walking.

442
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,302
Well, did it ever occur to you

443
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,042
that a 7:00 dinner
in Santa fucking Monica is too early?

444
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,346
I'm sorry, baby. I had a bad day.
I will be there.

445
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,352
I would not leave you
alone with my mother.

446
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,479
I know what could happen.
Love and kisses.

447
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,625
Ernesto,
where's my car?

448
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,217
It's on its way,
Mr. Gold.

449
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,252
Mr. McQuewick,
he called down also.

450
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,088
How are things, Ari?

451
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,498
Couldn't be better, Terence,
although it's 6:30.

452
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,436
You're usually out of here
by noon, so this is a little odd, no?

453
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,530
Why was Barbara Miller
at the offices today?

454
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:25,100
Vinnie came down with a little case
of puppy love, but it's under control.

455
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,077
Control's a funny thing,
isn't it, Ari?

456
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,444
You don't realize
how little of it you have

457
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,745
until you actually
have none of it at all.

458
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:34,445
Keep track
of your boy, Ari.

459
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,454
I'll be watching you.

460
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,718
Cheerio!

461
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,296
This looks phenomenal!

462
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,264
- Nice, Drama...
- Hey hey hey...

463
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:50,029
I figured the family needed
a little get-together.

464
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:53,037
With you gone the last few days,
it's been a little off around here.

465
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:54,698
We had dinner together
on Wednesday.

466
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,470
- We missed you, bro.
- Thanks, Johnny.

467
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,670
Bang!

468
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,770
Turtle, this isn't
dinner music.

469
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,509
Don't be a hater just 'cause you're
not the only manager in the house.

470
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,416
The guy's the next Russell Simmons.
Who would have thunk it?

471
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:08,919
- To Saigon.
- To "Aquaman."

472
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,149
- To the family being together again.
- Yes.

473
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,622
Cheers.

474
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,927
It's Ari.

475
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,930
Oh, this ought
to be good.

476
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,989
I better check up
on that roast.

477
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,728
Hey, Ari, what's up?

478
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:26,636
What's up is it's intervention time,
baby. This is the plan:

479
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,536
For $5,000 I can get
a cult deprogrammer

480
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,404
to come in
and brainwash Vinnie.

481
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:33,434
My sister Eileen went
to the Cornell Summer Program in '88,

482
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,105
came back
a fuckin' moonie.

483
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,774
Three sessions later
and bam...

484
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,680
she's a pilates instructor
in Tenafly.

485
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,276
He wants to have
an intervention.

486
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:44,413
- What should I say?
- I don't know. Improvise.

487
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,393
That sounds like
a great idea, Ari.

488
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,395
You should have
him meet us in Napa.

489
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,489
What's up in Napa? You guys
crushing grapes with Coppola?

490
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,831
See, after your conversation
with Vince, he had a major meltdown.

491
00:23:56,868 --> 00:24:00,167
Feels he let you down, so he just
jumped in the car and drove up.

492
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,038
- You fucking kidding me?
- Vince driving, can you believe that?

493
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:04,666
That's how
fucked up he is.

494
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,143
I'm behind him on the road
about 30 miles right now.

495
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,147
He won't stop or answer
his cell phone.

496
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:12,480
Says he's gonna shack up at
Auberge du Soleil and never come back.

497
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,485
I could use
your help up there.

498
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,714
- That's like a seven-hour drive.
- No shit.

499
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:19,383
The traffic's not that bad,
but you know, whatever, Ari.

500
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:21,756
Keep your phone on.
I'm heading north.

501
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,998
- You think he bought it?
- Hook, line, and sinker.

502
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,004
Way to sell it!

503
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,165
Hey hey hey, you guys
ready for some roast?

504
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,834
Yes, that looks good, Drama.
