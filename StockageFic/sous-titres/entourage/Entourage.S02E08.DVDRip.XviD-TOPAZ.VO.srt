1
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,629
Door number one
or door number two?

2
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:17,040
- What do you got?
- Let's take a moment to reminisce.

3
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,942
- Ari, come on.
- What's in the envelope?

4
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,173
Behind door number one...

5
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,205
is an "Aquaman" check

6
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,240
with two million
little fishies on it.

7
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,583
Hopefully, this will take care
of your delinquent

8
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,713
heating and electric bills.

9
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,884
- We'll take door number one.
- Wait wait wait. Let's take a moment

10
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,417
to celebrate how far
we've come, all right?

11
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,829
First check I ever got
for you... $668 for what?

12
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,799
- A guest star on "JAG."
- Guest star on "JAG,"

13
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,598
- and I did not take commission.
- No, you did not.

14
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:47,265
- This time I will.
- What's behind door number two, Ari?

15
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,138
- Door number two is a list.
- What list?

16
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,609
James Cameron's list
for Aquagirl...

17
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,703
five of the hottest
actresses on the planet,

18
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,976
one of which,
you will be stuck

19
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:58,950
in a water tank
with for nine months.

20
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:02,148
Even if you look like
our skim milk-colored friend E here,

21
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,351
you still have a good shot
of swimming in-between her legs.

22
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,120
Wait, E. We'll save it
for the beach...

23
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,627
have something to talk
to the guys about.

24
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,755
You don't talk about politics
at the beach? Pretty cool, huh?

25
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,733
It'd be a lot cooler
if you gave us the check, Ari.

26
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,598
- I'm gone.
- Where you running to?

27
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:20,094
It's a day of beauty for me.
I'm going in front of the cameras.

28
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,802
What are you doing,
agency yearbook photos?

29
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,901
Actually, I made
a little list of my own.

30
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,003
"Fade-In" magazine's
"Top 40 Under 40."

31
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,173
Sandwiched in between
"The O.C."'s creator Josh Schwartz

32
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:33,117
and Miramax's Meryl Poster,
at number nine, is yours truly.

33
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,281
Don't worry about it, E.
When they do a top 40 under four feet...

34
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,313
boom, top of the list.

35
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,494
Holy shit. Are we
gonna go cash this?

36
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,800
- Not now. We're on our way to Malibu.
- Malibu? I booked a massage.

37
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,568
So cancel it.
I'll have Turtle give you a rubdown.

38
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,040
Eww.

39
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,066
What the hell's
in Malibu?

40
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:02,047
Marcel, cancel my 11:00
deep-tissue, please. Thank you.

41
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,106
Fuckin' Malibu.

42
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,836
Who has a party at 10:00 A.M.
On Wednesday anyway?

43
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,777
I hope they have
an omelet chef.

44
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:35,440
- This place looks empty.
- Maybe people came by boat.

45
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,608
Boy, you guys sure do
complain a lot.

46
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,153
- Where'd you get a key?
- Jessica Alba gave it to me.

47
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,951
- She gave you a key to her house?
- No, she gave me the house.

48
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,485
Well, us... at least
for the next couple months.

49
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,055
- What do you mean?
- I told her our house

50
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,966
was under construction. She's off
shooting the new "Fantastic Four."

51
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,697
She said we can stay here

52
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,671
as long as we
take care of the cats.

53
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,272
How many cats
are there?

54
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,869
You're telling me we're
gonna live by the beach.

55
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,813
This is sick. This is like Far Rockaway
minus the crack whores.

56
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,282
I think it blows.
How am I gonna get to my auditions?

57
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,978
The P.C.H. Is
like a parking lot.

58
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,987
You can stay at our
house if it's easier.

59
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,921
By myself?

60
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,117
Fuck that.

61
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,188
Fucking cats.

62
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,829
You missed, motherfucker.

63
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,596
Come on.

64
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,298
- Ah! Fuck.
- Too slow, hombre. Let's go.

65
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,501
Take it easy.

66
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,532
You flinched.
It's a freebie. Come on.

67
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:43,339
Oh! God!

68
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,874
What do you guys think of
Cameron Diaz for Aquagirl?

69
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,613
- Love her.
- Fuck that.

70
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:50,020
She got a boyfriend.
Upside is you bang her,

71
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,456
he gets pissed off.
Downside is she's loyal.

72
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,585
Who wants to make a movie
with someone you have no shot at?

73
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,993
- He's got a point.
- Jennifer Garner.

74
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,830
- Love her.
- Boyfriend!

75
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,768
- Kirsten Dunst?
- She already fucked a superhero.

76
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,703
- She's single though.
- Who else you got?

77
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,706
Mandy Moore?

78
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,868
- You flinched, Drama.
- Bullshit. I was reacting to Mandy.

79
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,105
You did a few weeks on
"A Walk to Remember."

80
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,013
- Did you like her?
- Yeah, she was great.

81
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,313
Come on. We're not gonna get
into this whole thing again.

82
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:21,411
- What whole thing?
- There is no "whole thing."

83
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,445
Did you go out
with Mandy Moore?

84
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,480
Yeah, I mean...

85
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:29,052
- a couple times. It was no big deal.
- I never heard about that.

86
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,791
You were still spinnin'
pizzas back East.

87
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,299
- So what's the deal?
- Nothing. We went out

88
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,928
for a little while and, like
everything does, it ended.

89
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,938
- So she hates you.
- Nah, I don't think she hates me.

90
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:42,999
Come on.

91
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:46,239
She probably hates ya.

92
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,338
How do they not
have Fruit Loops?

93
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,905
You can't get anything
in Malibu

94
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,576
because it's impossible
to get deliveries.

95
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:54,279
You make it like we're
in the Far East, Drama.

96
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,948
I know Malibu. One second
it's no Fruit Loops, the next

97
00:05:56,989 --> 00:06:00,356
a mudslide is slinging a 400-Ib. Boulder
through your dining room.

98
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,055
Okay, let's see, what else
do we need? Essentials.

99
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,758
More protein, man.
We gotta bulk Vince up.

100
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,629
Seriously, Aquaman
is fuckin' yoked.

101
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,828
Where is Vince, anyway?

102
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,928
I left him on aisle nine
with that MILF.

103
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,337
He's probably banging her
in the produce section.

104
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,309
Look, guys, Cameron wants
a more fluid swimmer than bulky,

105
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,538
so don't go gettin'
Vince's head all fucked up.

106
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,547
If you don't want
Vince's head fucked up,

107
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,209
make sure Mandy Moore
doesn't get this movie.

108
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,151
- Seriously, that will drown Aquaman.
- Why? What he do to her?

109
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,120
To her? It's what
she did to him.

110
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,453
She crushed him, bro.
Crushed him.

111
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,119
Come on, I've never seen
Vince hurt over a girl.

112
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,152
It got ugly, E.
He was doing drive-bys to her house,

113
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,164
- late night hang-ups.
- He made a mix tape.

114
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,826
- Bullshit.
- No, I swear! You remember that?

115
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,336
- He led it off with "Tiny Dancer."
- Elton John?

116
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,838
Him and Mandy saw
"Almost Famous" like 20 times.

117
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,068
Now I know you're
fuckin' with me.

118
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,702
Mandy Moore is
Aquaman's kryptonite, bro.

119
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,075
Trust me.

120
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,546
Yo, that woman
has Fruit Loops!

121
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,675
She probably got the one box
that was able to make it out.

122
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,743
- It's Dr. Joyce Brothers.
- Oh, yeah?

123
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,012
Drama, go distract her.

124
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,921
Don't make a scene
out here, Drama.

125
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,949
There's only two
markets in Malibu.

126
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:11,657
Are you kiddin'? With this performance,
she won't notice a thing.

127
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,189
- Dr. Brothers?
- Yes.

128
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,701
- Hi, I'm a big fan.
- Oh, thank you.

129
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,294
This is kind
of embarrassing,

130
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:21,738
but sometimes I wake up
in the morning fully-tented.

131
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:25,335
- Any advice?
- At your age, consider yourself lucky.

132
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,243
My age?

133
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,407
How fuckin' old
do you think I am?

134
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,384
What are you guys leaving me
with that crazy mother for?

135
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,750
- Looked like you were having fun.
- The lady was nuts,

136
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,153
- told me she wanted to take me home.
- You serious?

137
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,421
It's total lawlessness out here.

138
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,984
Yeah, hello?

139
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,555
- Johnny. Johnny?
- Hello? I can't hear you!

140
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,158
Fuckin' Malibu.
I get no reception out here.

141
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,930
Lighten up, Johnny,
I can hear you fine.

142
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,766
- Hey, Adam.
- I know it's last minute,

143
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,570
but I got a Hallmark M.O.W.
Joe Mantegna, Tess Harper.

144
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,475
You know what Hallmark means, right?
It means Emmy.

145
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,207
I always did want one
of those winged angels.

146
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,238
You're in at 2:15.

147
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:07,184
2:15? It's 11:00 A.M.
I'm in Malibu. I can't do that.

148
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,620
- Can you make it like around 5:00?
- Come on, Johnny.

149
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,123
You can get this.
Now drive like the wind.

150
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,827
- What do you got?
- Movie of the week with Joe Mantegna.

151
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:19,593
- Joe Montana's acting?
- Joe Mantegna, dickhead.

152
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,224
Who wants to take a ride
into town with me?

153
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,827
Sorry, Johnny.
Got a scuba lesson. Take Turtle.

154
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,929
Come on, Vince!
I want to learn to scuba.

155
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,566
- You know how buoyant I am.
- Come on, Turtle.

156
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,076
All right.

157
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,544
But you owe me
a flinch from before.

158
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,013
All right, fine.
Hurry up, get it over with.

159
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,482
I only need one.

160
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,253
- Mmm!
- Ow-ho-ho-ho!

161
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,156
I love that shit!

162
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,924
You got Gold.

163
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:54,091
Do you really answer the phone
that way or did you see it was me?

164
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:57,534
Don't tilt your head. You can't hold
the phone when I'm cutting your hair.

165
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,595
- Lloyd, come hold the phone.
- You're impossible today.

166
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,334
You're impossible, my man.

167
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,399
Dana Gordon,
the second love of my life,

168
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:06,240
- what can I do for you?
- Look, I have a little heads-up,

169
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,009
but it's for your ears only.
Swear you won't tell anyone.

170
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,243
Did I tell anyone
that your first girl-girl sex

171
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,343
was with someone
from must-see TV in '95?

172
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,876
- Okay, Ari, please.
- Spill it.

173
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,219
I'll swallow a cyanide tablet
if they capture me.

174
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:20,919
Okay. Mandy Moore has moved
to the top of the list, all right?

175
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,986
James sat down with her and he loves
her skin tone next to the water.

176
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,897
- Is that official?
- We're ready to make an offer.

177
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:30,266
But here's the thing.
I know that Vince and Mandy dated.

178
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,602
- Did you know that?
- I know everything about my clients.

179
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,800
Well, then will you
tell me what you know

180
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,105
about the "Walk to Remember" incident?

181
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,601
Why am I doing this anyway?

182
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,443
You're part of the team,
that's why.

183
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,949
Yeah, well, it's not natural
to breathe underwater.

184
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,576
You didn't have a problem
in the pool.

185
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,086
A pool's a pool.

186
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,281
Ocean's an ocean.
No sharks in the pool.

187
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,291
Don't worry.

188
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,055
If we come across any sharks,
you got Aquaman to protect you.

189
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,891
Wow. That's comforting.

190
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,369
- Hey.
- Where are you?

191
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,098
Just heading to Vince's
scuba lesson.

192
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,538
Ah, scuba. Sport normally reserved
for the rich,

193
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,371
but you get free lessons
from a Navy Seal

194
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,808
because you happen
to have been born

195
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,505
- next door to Vince.
- What's up, Ari?

196
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,379
Do you know anything
about Vince and Mandy Moore?

197
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:19,077
- No.
- "A Walk to Remember"?

198
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,086
- What about it?
- Well, apparently

199
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,179
they had to shut the production
down for two days

200
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,622
because Vince
was harassing her?

201
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,353
The studio's
very concerned.

202
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,384
You know what?
I'll call you back, Ari.

203
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,192
Listen, they want her,
but if this causes a problem for Vince,

204
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,756
I will squash it.
James Cameron does not want

205
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,031
- a mopey Aquaman.
- Look, I said I'll call you back.

206
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,537
You better do it quickly,
'cause normally

207
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,267
I would not care
if you drown,

208
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,241
but I need an answer
right away.

209
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,470
What happened?

210
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,503
They want to offer
the movie to Mandy Moore.

211
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,412
Hmm. Interesting.

212
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,295
Fucking Malibu!

213
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,121
Look, all I'm asking is

214
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,453
what happened
with you and Mandy.

215
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,219
I told you, we went out
for a little while.

216
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,026
- The guys say she crushed you.
- I wouldn't say "crushed."

217
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,292
Oh no? Well, Turtle says
you made her a mix tape.

218
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,889
So full of shit.

219
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,367
Yeah, all right.
I made her a mix tape.

220
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,894
- I didn't send it though.
- The studio knows you went out.

221
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,873
- They're concerned.
- What are they concerned about?

222
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,206
Some kind of an incident
on "A Walk to Remember."

223
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,801
Like what?

224
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,177
Ari said they shut down
production for two days

225
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,182
'cause you were
harassing her.

226
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,582
- And you believe that?
- No, of course not.

227
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,485
I mean, did they
shut down production?

228
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,819
Did they shut down production?

229
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,257
Oh, yeah. They did
shut down production.

230
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,193
The crew ate bad clams.

231
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,220
Look, the bottom line is, if you want,
we can get her off the movie.

232
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:13,993
E, this has been
like five years already.

233
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,432
This is a stupid conversation.

234
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,833
I haven't even
thought about her

235
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,336
till her name was
mentioned this morning.

236
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,338
Will you pop the trunk?

237
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,999
Hey, gents, who's ready

238
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,599
for the first
open ocean dive?

239
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,542
- Hey, what's up, Dale?
- I'll tell you what's up.

240
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,138
Mr. Cameron wants you
ocean ready in two weeks,

241
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,512
and that means
the kiddy pool is history.

242
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:34,007
Now, E, if you can't
handle this, tell me now.

243
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,044
I don't think I can handle it.

244
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,853
When did you become
such a pussy?

245
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,325
4-H camp, '85.
You don't remember that?

246
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,328
I almost drowned
in the undertow.

247
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,125
Oh yeah? The lake
had an undertow?

248
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,325
Now, E, you ought not
to sweat this small stuff.

249
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,630
I have revived people
on seven continents,

250
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,262
and never lost...
actually, I did lose one,

251
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,898
but that was in Antarctica,
and I blame it on the cold.

252
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,931
Now get your gear
and let's go.

253
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,873
I'm gonna be late.
I'm gonna miss this.

254
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,280
Would you calm down?
I'm driving like a champ.

255
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,250
Let me out.

256
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,980
How are you gonna
audition like that?

257
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,487
You're sweating
like an animal!

258
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,522
Damn, I knew it!

259
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,860
Johnny, we were just
about to close up shop.

260
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,059
- I didn't think you were gonna make it.
- Sorry, Sheila.

261
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,568
I came in all the way
from Malibu.

262
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:26,400
"All the way from Malibu"?
You must be exhausted.

263
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,429
- Yeah.
- Come on in.

264
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,700
Johnny Chase.

265
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,421
Let's try and not have
another incident like last year,

266
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,660
huh, John?

267
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,692
Thanks.

268
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,603
All I'm saying is, this is the most
important movie of your career.

269
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,733
I'm not sure you wanna take a chance
of fucking it up over some girl.

270
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,267
Hey, Eric, this could be the most
important movie of her career,

271
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,042
and you wanna fuck that up
because you think I can't handle it?

272
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,743
Look, I'm not worried about her.
I'm worried about you.

273
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,752
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

274
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,983
The fact that we're even
talking about this is nuts!

275
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,287
Hey! You two sweethearts
wanna shut the fuck up

276
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,884
and focus on the ocean?

277
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,758
I just got off the horn
with the coast guard.

278
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,697
They said there's a high shark alert
between now and noon.

279
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,563
Mr. Cameron wants
to do this anyway,

280
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:32,196
so that means you're gonna have to keep
you head up and swiveling.

281
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,365
Are you fucking with us?

282
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,271
Yeah, I'm fucking with you.

283
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,798
But I wasn't fucking with you

284
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,811
about that guy who
croaked in Antarctica,

285
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,335
so stay alert.

286
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,178
Now, get over here
and get your shit on.

287
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,081
And besides,
if James Cameron

288
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,746
wants her in the movie,
she's in the movie.

289
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,356
Fucking incident!

290
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,858
That's what this prick says to me!

291
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,054
Davies set me up.

292
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,562
What's this guy doing
up my ass?

293
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,894
Don't you know the expression
"Never drive angry"?

294
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,695
And this beady-eyed
little jerk-off

295
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,965
just sitting on his Sidekick again,
just goading me!

296
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,598
He probably wasn't
even talking to anyone.

297
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,232
Get off my ass!
Go around me!

298
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,266
Would you pull over
and let me drive?

299
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,471
Do you really
find it necessary

300
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,946
to drive up my ass?

301
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,006
Fuck you, dude.

302
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,075
"Dude"?! Do you believe
this guy?

303
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,677
Fucking locals!

304
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,415
Fuck you, townie!

305
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,057
Asshole!

306
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,754
Take it easy, Drama. Do we really need
a midday fight right now?

307
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,387
Why don't you get out
of the car

308
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,694
- and say it to my face, fucker!
- Drama, come on!

309
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,929
Why are we picking a fight with
Point Break? Let's just get out of here.

310
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,335
Why don't you do yourself a favor,
tough guy?

311
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:42,135
Get back in your car
before someone gets hurt.

312
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,972
Weren't you on TV
or something before?

313
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,807
Yeah, I was.

314
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,211
Yeah, like 20 fucking
years ago!

315
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:54,217
- That's it.
- Go do it, man.

316
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,589
What the fuck you doing?!

317
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,222
What are you doing
to my car?!

318
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,329
What the fuck are you
doing to my car?!

319
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,131
Drama, your phone's ringing.

320
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,037
- Pick it up!
- That's my car, dude!

321
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,200
Hey, Adam.

322
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,505
No, he can't come
to the phone.

323
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,411
It's your agent,
you booked the gig!

324
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,914
I booked it?

325
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:25,041
You booked it, motherfucker!
We'll call you back.

326
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,745
Yes!

327
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,013
- I booked it!
- Drop the club!

328
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:31,352
- Thank God!
- Step away form the car, now!

329
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,182
Hey, uh,

330
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,024
you guys like Joe Montegna?

331
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,996
Adios, amigo!

332
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,800
- What happened?
- What happened is

333
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,137
I just got an M.O.W. For NBC!

334
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,335
We're both working men now, kid.

335
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,777
I think what he means
is why did you get arrested, Drama?

336
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,370
The lunatic
went Jack Nicholson

337
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,746
on some poor guy's car.

338
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,444
I hope you didn't use
my nine-iron.

339
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,282
No, I used E's Calloway.

340
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,947
He's got a court date
next week.

341
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,115
If you're lucky, Vince,
they'll put him away for life.

342
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,990
This is gonna be all over the papers.
There's no way to stop it.

343
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,359
Good. People will think
my brother's tough,

344
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,728
know not
to fuck with me.

345
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,290
- Hey.
- Hey, did Drama get his salad tossed?

346
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,734
Stop fantasizing, Ari.
What's going on? Is Mandy Moore in?

347
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,034
The offer went out,
but get this...

348
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:22,131
She wants to have
dinner with me?

349
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,641
Yeah, she wants to make sure

350
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,007
it's not gonna be awkward
before she says yes.

351
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,343
Of course it's gonna be
awkward, Vince.

352
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,348
This girl ruined your youth!

353
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,577
You're the star.
Tell them you don't want her.

354
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,212
I'm gonna tell Davies I want a say
who's playing my love interest.

355
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,222
Why don't you get
Lorenzo Lamas, Drama?

356
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,723
So you're telling me she'll pass

357
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,520
on a James Cameron movie
if it's awkward?

358
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,652
Jesus Christ, Vince,
what did you do to this girl?

359
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,525
Nothing! Shauna, you remember.

360
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,463
I remember you living
on the break-up diet

361
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,728
of canned tuna and saltines.
You dropped 15 Ibs.

362
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,564
You looked like fucking
Adrian Brody in "The Pianist."

363
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,536
I'm starting to get
annoyed by all of you.

364
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,233
I have no feelings
about this at all.

365
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,902
And besides, she's got
a very serious boyfriend,

366
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,571
so there's nothing wrong
if she wants to sit down.

367
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,172
So we're gonna sit down.
Set up the meeting, E.

368
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,418
Uh, Vince?

369
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,750
- She don't have a boyfriend.
- What are you talking about?

370
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,379
She's dating that
big real estate guy.

371
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,947
They broke up.
They had a big fight over a cockroach.

372
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,583
She threw a mojito
in his face.

373
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,890
- You were there?
- No, I read about it in "US Weekly."

374
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,625
- Is this true?
- I heard something about it,

375
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,565
but you know what?
She's got a shitty publicist

376
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,295
or that would have
never made the papers.

377
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:24,859
You know what?
Whatever.

378
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,599
Either way, set up the dinner.
I'll show up.

379
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,573
Is the script in the frame?
It's cool, right here?

380
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,171
I want to make sure
it looks like I'm really reading it.

381
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,079
Jess! Am I photo-friendly?
How is it going?

382
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,913
- Ari, we need to talk.
- Right.

383
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,749
What are you gonna do? Are you gonna
bump Patrick Weitzel off the list?

384
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,049
'Cause I'm officially
okay with that.

385
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:46,546
Ari, what year
did you graduate?

386
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,753
Uh, 1990.

387
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,285
Huh-uh, not law school.
Undergrad.

388
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,166
What are you inferring?

389
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,169
You're ineligible.
Your birthday's Thursday.

390
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,398
Right, Thursday
I'm gonna be 36.

391
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,407
Can you believe it?
Time flies, huh?

392
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,875
No, you're
turning 40, Ari.

393
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,071
I just got off the phone
with your old assistant

394
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,138
Josh Weinstein. 40.

395
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,742
Weinstein.

396
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,945
Come on, guys, let's go.
Let's wrap it up.

397
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,614
We're not staying.

398
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,954
Someone's gonna pay
for the mystic tan, Jess?

399
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,358
You're staying.
I'm gonna take some family photos.

400
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,021
You guys work
for me now.

401
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,963
Yeah, Rufus, thanks for doing this
so quick.

402
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,796
It was nothing.
I just repo'd all this shit

403
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,495
out of Don Johnson's
house anyway.

404
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,094
The motherfucker tried
to pay me

405
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:34,105
with signed
"Nash Bridges" DVDs.

406
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:36,369
Season three,
episode seven,

407
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,842
me and Cheech, enjoy.

408
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,846
All right, here we go.

409
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,246
He's really outclassed
here tonight.

410
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,751
Now this place is a home.

411
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,753
Six months tops,
the salt water

412
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,948
will chew a hole
right through that screen.

413
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,753
- This kid's a fucking misery, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

414
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,192
Hey guys, how do I look?

415
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,128
How do you look?
You look like you.

416
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,256
He's saying
you look good, Vince.

417
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,062
I don't love the shirt,
personally.

418
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,624
Rufus, you don't like
the shirt?

419
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,467
Vince, that shirt dulls
the sparkle in your eyes.

420
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:09,497
If I was you, I'd go
with blue Faconnable.

421
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,840
It says, "Hello, I'm here,
and I'm doing fine without you."

422
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,539
Vince, you're
kidding me, right?

423
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,980
I know you 25 years,
you never asked me how you looked.

424
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,482
You know you look
fucking good.

425
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,452
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm just kidding.

426
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,454
Could go
for a smoke, though.

427
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,115
I got a pound
of the bubble kush stashed

428
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,819
- in the wheel well of my DeVille.
- Roll one up.

429
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,394
- Cool.
- I'm gonna change the shirt.

430
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,292
- Cool.
- I'm gonna change the shirt.

431
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,631
Mandy Moore...

432
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,361
kryptonite.

433
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,305
Any big news stories
today, E?

434
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,871
What do you mean?

435
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,145
Mandy's really smart.
She was always testing me

436
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,879
on what was going on
in the world.

437
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,944
I heard Pamela Anderson
dropped another tit size.

438
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,546
- Thanks, Turtle.
- Just tell her

439
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,989
you're devastated by
what's going on in Africa.

440
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,652
It says you're up
on current events

441
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,560
- and you're sensitive.
- Yeah.

442
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,996
All right,
I'm going in.

443
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,933
All right. Go get her, Vince.
Head up, baby.

444
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,731
Yo, remember,

445
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,237
the movie's called
"Aquaman,"

446
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,331
not "Aquagirl."

447
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,865
Go get her.

448
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,881
- Vince, how are you?
- Hey, Charlie, how are you doing?

449
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,650
Miss Moore's waiting
at your table.

450
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,817
All right.
See you.

451
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,657
- Hey!
- Hey. Oh.

452
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,166
- How are you?
- Hello.

453
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,667
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

454
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,670
Good to see you too.

455
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:59,315
Well, I guess we've proven
that this won't be awkward.

456
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,426
Damn, I should have
told him about that busload of nuns

457
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,259
that fell off that
cliff last month.

458
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:14,060
What he should have
been talking about

459
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,897
was all the girls he's banged
in the last five years.

460
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,766
That would have
drove her crazy.

461
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,897
I can't believe
I'm waiting outside a restaurant

462
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,930
while he's on a date.

463
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,374
How do you like
being a manager now, E?

464
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,476
I was.

465
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,141
- That's not how I remember it.
- You have your memories,

466
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,741
and I have mine.

467
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,411
Let's try and cherish them both.

468
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,080
Okay.

469
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:38,521
Can you believe
it's been five years?

470
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,650
I know, time is flying, huh?

471
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,456
And you don't think
it's strange we've never spoken?

472
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,628
We had an on-set romance.

473
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,634
These things don't last.

474
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,636
Wow!

475
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,467
Someone's gotten glib.

476
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,497
Well, I've glibbened with age.

477
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,566
What can I say?

478
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,972
- I know that's not a word.
- I wasn't gonna correct you.

479
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:04,276
- Really?
- Okay, I was,

480
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,147
but I realized
that you were kidding.

481
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,449
Look, I don't know
what to say.

482
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:15,358
Why don't you tell me
why you never called me back?

483
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,658
I mean, l...

484
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,960
I was humiliated.
What do you...

485
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:22,091
You asked me to marry you
after five weeks.

486
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,398
- I was 20!
- I thought I was in love with you.

487
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,063
I thought I was in love
with you too.

488
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,038
I just thought
you were half-kidding.

489
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,472
No, I wasn't.

490
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,476
But look, this is fate, right?

491
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,377
Every time I've ever done a movie,
I've always imagined them

492
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,506
telling me that you were
gonna be the girl.

493
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:39,244
And you are the girl.

494
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:40,717
You're single,
I'm single.

495
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,379
We'll take it slow,
see what happens.

496
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,322
No no no,
I'm not single.

497
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,655
I'm getting married
in a month.

498
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,599
How'd it go?

499
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,733
She was right. It's awkward.

500
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,073
Let's get her off the movie.
