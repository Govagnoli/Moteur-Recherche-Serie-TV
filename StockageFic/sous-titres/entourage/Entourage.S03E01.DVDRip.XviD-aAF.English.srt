1
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,719
- Six.
- Are you out of your mind, Drama?

2
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,671
That girl was perfect.

3
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,160
Excuse me, sweetheart.

4
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,629
How would you like to come to
a movie premiere Wednesday night?

5
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,989
Aquaman?

6
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,873
- I'd love to.
- Here you go.

7
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,558
- See you there.
- Thanks.

8
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,556
See you there.

9
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,431
"Six" my ass, Drama.

10
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,711
She was a six to me.
And I wouldn't have given her a ticket.

11
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,957
50 hot girls have walked by,
guy's had a problem with every one.

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,831
- Cos none will look at him.
- What was wrong with her?

13
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,518
She was top-tall, bro.

14
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,394
- What the fuck is top-tall?
- Torso's too long, legs are too short.

15
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,749
- She was inverted.
- Your brain's inverted.

16
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,711
I don't have to defend my rating system.

17
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,877
Every girl I've given a ticket to
has been at least an eight.

18
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,434
What do you rate, Drama? I'm curious.

19
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,789
I don't have to rate, I'm holding the cards.

20
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,308
Not many left.
How many did you guys give out?

21
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,874
- The right amount.
- It's like chumming for sharks.

22
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,878
Throw enough blood and guts in,
you'll catch a great white.

23
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,549
50 girls at the party
will show up thinking they're your dates.

24
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,478
And when 50 sharks
show up looking for goodies?

25
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,636
Feeding frenzy.

26
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,195
- Whatever. We got Ari in 30. Let's roll.
- Let's do it.

27
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,392
Ten.

28
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,152
- Last ticket.
- Our work here is done.

29
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,235
Excuse me!

30
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,359
Jesus Christ. Lloyd!

31
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,397
What the fuck is this?

32
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,750
- Your finger.
- It's dust. It's fucking dust. Why is it here?

33
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,394
The cleaning staff's on strike.
You know that.

34
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,150
They strike, you work. You're Asian.
You're supposed to be a neat freak. Get a rag.

35
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,077
You're nervous Vince is coming up.

36
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,393
It's the agent, Ari, not the office.

37
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,274
- And you do have a lovely view.
- It's West fucking Hollywood!

38
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,630
And what I got is nine people
in 1,400 square feet.

39
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,352
Now go grab a rag. Go!

40
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,029
I want every desk to be sterile enough
for you to get trained on.

41
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,515
Look at this.

42
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,711
- What a dump.
- You could use the exercise, fat boy.

43
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,558
Yeah? Race me up,
you 50-year-old cocksucker!

44
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,833
Hey, Lloyd.

45
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,750
Tell someone the elevator's out.

46
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,314
I would tell someone,
Johnny Drama, but who?

47
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,396
Do you need a quarter
to feed the meter?

48
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,715
- No, we're all good, Lloyd.
- I couldn't be repped at this shithole?

49
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,876
You've been repped at bigger shitholes.

50
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,831
What's the good word, boys?

51
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,791
Hey, Ari.

52
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,308
Hey, the place is,
it's really...

53
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,999
- It's nice.
- Thanks, Drama. How are you doing?

54
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,752
Still no agent. What do you say?

55
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,759
That it's important that whoever reps you
cares about you, right?

56
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,553
- Right.
- Right. Vinnie, E, let's go.

57
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,998
Awful. Just awful.

58
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,191
So boys, boys, big week.

59
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,437
The kind of week you will remember
your whole lives.

60
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,837
Like the week you got your first blowjob.
Remember that week? I do.

61
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,189
- Ninth grade.
- One of the boys on the chess team?

62
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,789
Oh, E. You could have never
gotten this girl. Never.

63
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,435
Beth Mariposa. Had a mouth
like a Dyson vacuum.

64
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,075
- Never lost suction...
- OK, Ari, big week. Why are we here?

65
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,951
- To talk business.
- Shoot.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,470
- Who are you taking to the premiere?
- I'm gonna roll with the boys.

67
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,671
You're not gonna roll the red carpet
with the Three Musketeers.

68
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,950
- Two. I'm bringing Sloan.
- Perfect.

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,912
Let Vinnie walk the rug with her.
She's too hot for you.

70
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,712
- He's worried.
- Definitely.

71
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,479
- What am I worried about?
- That the movie won't open.

72
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,717
- We shoulda taken a job.
- Should we have taken another job?

73
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,911
You take a job after we open.
Any job you want.

74
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,669
He always said, "You take your next job
before the last one opens."

75
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,755
That was your quote.

76
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,792
I amended it when you got James Cameron
and the biggest movie ever.

77
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,432
- He's nervous.
- Definitely.

78
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,994
I am not nervous. We are all good.

79
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,871
But this is the biggest night of your life.

80
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,354
This is your coming out party.
This ain't Head On.

81
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,916
We want to make a statement
that says, "I am a man now, not a boy."

82
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,552
Let's be classy.

83
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,955
You've been banging every girl
west of Sepulveda for six months.

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,037
Pick one skank that's gonna
photograph well. Boom!

85
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,150
That does sound classy.

86
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,031
For the love of God,
help me out here.

87
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,834
I agree it's a big night.
If you take someone you gotta be smart.

88
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,838
She'll be linked to you
so she has to be premiere-worthy.

89
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,632
OK. All right.

90
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,559
I just don't think any of
my "west of Sepulveda" skanks fit the bill.

91
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,392
Bottom line, there's only one woman
in my life who really is premiere-worthy.

92
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,793
- Who?
- Ma.

93
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,473
Aquamom! I love it. Boom!

94
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,791
There's no way Ma's coming to LA, bro.

95
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,990
- No way.
- We'll see.

96
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,395
She's never come before.
Why would she now?

97
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,919
- She won't.
- We'll see.

98
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,633
- Why do you keep saying, "We'll see"?
- I got a plan.

99
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,478
- What kind of plan?
- You'll see.

100
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,080
Power 106, Big Boy's neighbourhood.

101
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,556
Vincent Chase is in the hood!

102
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,398
The movie is Aquaman.
Premieres Wednesday.

103
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,635
- It's huge. It's everywhere.
- Everywhere.

104
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,797
My question to you, Vince, is... how is it?

105
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,673
I begged Ma to come to my Viking Quest
DVD release party.

106
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,678
She said no. What would possibly
get her to come to this?

107
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,315
Look at these two.

108
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,308
One on the left
is from the 50 Cent video.

109
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,915
Video hos. I love it.

110
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,075
What the fuck are you looking at?

111
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,115
I'm just playing with you, sweetie.

112
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,918
Flirty video hos. Even better.

113
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,952
- So, Big Boy, I need a favour.
- Anything for Aquaman. I got you.

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,436
I need you to call
the most beautiful woman in the world

115
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,516
and ask her to be my date for the premiere.

116
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,518
That's done. Get Halle Berry
on the phone for him.

117
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,473
Actually, Halle Berry doesn't even
hold a candle to this woman.

118
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,397
OK, now... Roll him out.

119
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,908
That's blasphemy.
That'll get you cut up in here.

120
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,871
- It's my mother.
- OK, I'm sorry.

121
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,353
- Good plan.
- We'll see.

122
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,676
Ma will not cave in
to public pressure. No way.

123
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,397
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs Chase?

124
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,635
- Yeah?
- It's Big Boy. You're live on the radio.

125
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,238
Power 106 in Los Angeles.

126
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,840
If I haven't won anything,
let me save you the time.

127
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,031
- Hey, Ma, don't hang up.
- Vincent, is that you?

128
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,231
- Yes, and we're live so don't curse.
- Please don't curse.

129
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,838
What do you mean we're live?

130
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,633
Don't do this to me.
I'm standing here in a robe.

131
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,990
Ma, no one can see you.
Calm down and don't curse.

132
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,759
What am I, an animal?
Please stop saying that.

133
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,439
- Is your brother with you?
- He's outside.

134
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,677
- Has he gotten any work?
- Don't worry about Johnny.

135
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,269
We'll talk about him later.
I want to talk to you, OK?

136
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,709
You're brothers?

137
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,910
- Yeah.
- I'm a close cousin.

138
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,951
Over the radio you need to talk to me?

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,594
I want you to come
to the LA premiere with me.

140
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,915
This is not the forum for this discussion.

141
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,996
- She is not coming.
- Of course not.

142
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,349
- What's the issues?
- She doesn't like to travel.

143
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,992
- That's an issue.
- All right.

144
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,315
I don't need the whole world
thinking I'm a lunatic.

145
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,828
Look. I haven't been out
of New York in 30 years.

146
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,996
- She's breaking.
- Not even close.

147
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,873
- Putting me live on the radio...
- Ma, you know what?

148
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,708
Forget about the 100 million
potentially heartbroken listeners

149
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,274
- and listen for a second.
- Oh, fuck, Vincent.

150
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,029
- Mama Gangster.
- I knew she'd curse.

151
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,798
- Cos she's breaking.
- No way.

152
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,109
Yeah, baby?

153
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,391
I love you and I've never
pressured you to come out.

154
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,750
Not for any of my premieres,
not when I bought my house.

155
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,758
But I didn't realise
what a big night this was.

156
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,394
It's important to me
that I share it with you.

157
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,874
So I'll send a boat, I'll send a plane.

158
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,558
I'll do whatever I have to do,

159
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,672
but I want you by my side
when I walk down that red carpet.

160
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,996
- This is moving shit.
- Still won't work.

161
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,310
- Yeah?
- All right.

162
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,351
I will do it. I'm coming.

163
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,510
You got yourself a date!

164
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,915
I can't believe it.
She better come to my next premiere.

165
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,395
Why don't you guys
take us to this premiere?

166
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,037
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

167
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,435
There's no more tickets.
What do you want?

168
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,311
- More tickets.
- Just two.

169
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,638
Don't make a big deal out of it.
I'm still stinging cos Ma favours Vince.

170
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,318
Ari gave you 50 tickets.

171
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,033
You want more have Vince call him
and ask him.

172
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,390
Vince, will you call Ari
and ask him for two more tickets?

173
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,996
Please, Vince!
We peaked too early. Don't punish us.

174
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,952
How were we to know
best in show would appear so late?

175
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,310
Let me ask you a question.
What's so special about these two?

176
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,396
These two will fuck us if we take 'em.

177
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,351
- Guaranteed.
- How do you know?

178
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,109
Cos they said, "If you take us we'll fuck you."

179
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,276
Call Ari.

180
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,278
Are these for Vince
or more for Turtle and Drama?

181
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,312
- They're for Vince, Ari.
- Don't lie to me, E.

182
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,751
Your business manager's on the phone.

183
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,190
I'm in the gym until 11:30.
I need two more tickets for Vince.

184
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,958
We don't have any more.

185
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,719
Take two from Jimmy Woods,
he never uses them all.

186
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,594
- OK, but your business manager, Ari.
- The gym, Lloyd. The fucking gym!

187
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,675
It's pretty urgent.

188
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,076
It's pretty urgent
that in the 15 minutes a day I have free

189
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,111
I take the time to keep this body fit.

190
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,869
Not just so you have
a great ass to look at - I want to live.

191
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,196
He says that you bounced
a cheque to your kids' school.

192
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,308
So... you'll just send
those tickets over, Ari?

193
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,237
Thanks.

194
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,238
No wonder everyone
at the book drive was staring at me.

195
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,239
They were staring because you're hot.
The other mommies are ugly.

196
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,512
This is so humiliating. I had no idea
we were in this amount of trouble, Ari!

197
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,155
It's not like this was tuition.
This was our charitable donation.

198
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,637
25,000-bucks-a-year tuition
so a six-year-old can play with blocks

199
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,514
and they still want a charitable donation?
This won't affect our kids.

200
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,269
- We'll never see the kids this affects.
- Tell me what you need now.

201
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,835
Now that you ask, we gotta
pay off the staff, we got rent...

202
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,757
- What's the number?
- 100 grand.

203
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,837
- Jesus!
- Come on, baby. I'm on fumes here.

204
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,077
It'll float me until I get
the settlement from Terence.

205
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,749
Well, I have dipped into my personal savings
five times already.

206
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,472
"What's mine is yours."

207
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,080
- Sell your car.
- Sell your fucking watch.

208
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,475
You eat at The Palm four nights a week.

209
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,272
Do I ever order the lobster?

210
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,278
No, I order the Gigi salad
and I sign clients.

211
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,231
The master plan is happening here.

212
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,397
The seeds have been planted
all over this town. You know that.

213
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,158
They just need a little water.

214
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,395
But when are they gonna grow?

215
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,193
Vinnie opens on Friday.
He is the first seed to bloom.

216
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,789
- He'll be the biggest star. You know that.
- No, Ari. I don't.

217
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,274
Well, you need to know
that I know that.

218
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,312
Trust me the way
you trust your daddy's trust fund.

219
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,796
You call them personal savings
but you haven't saved shit personally.

220
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,114
Whatever, Ari.

221
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,199
My father put that money aside in case
something happened and it's almost gone.

222
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,516
I could've banged Heidi Klum
when she was 23 but I took a pass.

223
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,075
- What the fuck is gonna make me leave?
- You could die.

224
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,678
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

225
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,395
Not until I saw that the life insurance
cheque didn't bounce.

226
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,439
- What do you think about this?
- I like it.

227
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,109
Ma would look great in that.
What about this?

228
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,470
- Look how excited you are.
- Does that make me a pussy?

229
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,954
No, it makes you a man.
A very handsome one.

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,911
- What size is she?
- I don't know. E?

231
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,838
I don't know women's dress sizes
and I don't look at your mom's body.

232
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,394
You don't?
I look at your mom's.

233
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,032
Shut the fuck up.

234
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,674
We'll take this whole rack
in different sizes.

235
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,597
Nice when you're on commissions.

236
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,234
Let's find me a dress
that makes my tits pop.

237
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,437
You have me walking up. Do you know
how much these shoes cost?

238
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,516
Of course. I fucking paid for them.

239
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,233
And you told me I was gonna meet
Jim Cameron.

240
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,840
We were supposed to have lunch last week.

241
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,440
- Jim Cameron, I love that.
- You know what?

242
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,948
Now where are we?
This fucking place.

243
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,630
- This way.
- How do you know?

244
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,432
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

245
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,913
Please.

246
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,954
Fucking elevator's broken, Lloyd.
Are you aware?

247
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,228
Yes. Hi, Mr Woods.

248
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,033
So this is the shithole he works out of.

249
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,709
- You haven't been here?
- No, he hides this place like Anne Frank.

250
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,076
Get your own girlfriend.

251
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,429
Mr Woods, did you get your premiere tickets?

252
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,199
Some of them, Lloyd. Some.

253
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,912
- Hello?
- Johnny Drama.

254
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,349
It seems that we made a terrible mistake.

255
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,994
The tickets we sent you
belong to James Woods.

256
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,918
Oh, yeah? That sucks.

257
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,474
Yes, it sucks.
And I need them back.

258
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,873
- No go.
- Fuck that.

259
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,630
Lloyd, possession is two-fifths of the law.

260
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,955
- Get Woods two more.
- There are no more.

261
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,549
Mr James Woods is very unhappy
and he wants them back.

262
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,878
Sorry, bro, but you tell Jimmy Woods -
and this is from me personally -

263
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,150
if he wants 'em
he can come and get 'em.

264
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,068
Fuck Jimmy Woods.

265
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,118
I heard.

266
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,832
Is this for your date?

267
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,269
- He's taking his mother.
- That's sweet.

268
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,515
I can't decide.
Should I take 'em all?

269
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,233
If you're desperate
for frequent flyer mileage.

270
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,396
I'm gonna take them all.

271
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,513
Here, take my card too.
In case you need anything else.

272
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,232
Just say what you really mean.

273
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,359
- Hello?
- Eric, it's your other mother.

274
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,630
Hey, Rita. Why aren't you on the plane?

275
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,240
- Eric, is Vince with you?
- Yeah, are you OK?

276
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,316
- Hold on.
- No, don't get him.

277
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,079
Look, I'm at the airport. I can't do it.

278
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,317
I can't get on the plane.
I've been in the limo for over an hour.

279
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,828
- Did you miss your flight?
- I'm not coming.

280
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,952
- Let me put Vince on.
- No, don't, please.

281
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,639
I can't have him guilt-tripping me
about this.

282
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,910
Tell him I love him.
Tell him I miss him.

283
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,552
Tell him to wear a suit.

284
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,236
Tell him I'm very sorry. Bye-bye.

285
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,950
- Ari?
- No, it was your mother.

286
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,070
She's not on the plane?

287
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,512
Sweetie, just calm, OK?

288
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,798
Of course.

289
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,158
Holy shit, it's Woods.

290
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,919
- Hey, Drama, it's Jimmy Woods.
- What?

291
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,994
Hello?

292
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,352
I need my tickets.

293
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,518
What tickets, Jimmy?

294
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,638
Drama, look, I got a...
I got a big day for the...

295
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,832
You know, I got to get a facial.
Just give me the fucking tickets.

296
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,829
No.

297
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,199
How about... How about
you got five seconds

298
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,028
to give me... my fucking tickets?

299
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,798
Five.

300
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,114
Or what?

301
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,789
You gonna huff and puff
and blow the house down?

302
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,195
How about I'm gonna knock
this door down

303
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,993
and come in and shove
your head up Turtle's ass?

304
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,794
Give me my fucking tickets!
You got five seconds!

305
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,199
You pussy.

306
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,708
A clever pussy.

307
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,830
There are no tickets
in that envelope.

308
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,273
Sneaky sneaky.

309
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,356
- Fuck with me?
- Remember your blood pressure.

310
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,914
- My blood pressure up the ass.
- Just...

311
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,996
I've got medicine for this shit, OK?

312
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,271
I've got so many fucking pills
I feel like I work for Pfizer.

313
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,072
- Come here.
- All right.

314
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,955
I'll see you tomorrow night, Vince!
And up your ass!

315
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,352
I got it. Jessica Biel.

316
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,710
- Take Jessica Biel, Vince.
- I don't know Jessica Biel, Turtle.

317
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,990
So get to know her
and get to bang her.

318
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,271
- Or get to know her so I can bang her.
- OK, I'll do my best.

319
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,151
- Don't take someone famous.
- Why?

320
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,599
They'll overshadow him.

321
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,392
I learned that from Tom Sizemore

322
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,000
when he brought Heidi Fleiss
to the Black Hawk Down premiere.

323
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,270
Bringing a hooker's probably
not a good idea either.

324
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,710
I wasn't going with Ma for the press
and I won't go with anybody else for the press.

325
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,149
I'll go by myself. It's no big deal.

326
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,158
Thanks for dinner, Johnny.
I'm gonna go get changed.

327
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,555
Meeting the jewellery store girl.

328
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,790
- He's bummed.
- He loves strawberries.

329
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,035
Ma must be bummed too,
missing something big.

330
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,514
Nah, Ma doesn't care
if she misses things

331
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,393
as long as no one else
she knows catches them.

332
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,556
Ma can be very petty.

333
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,270
What? What's with the look?

334
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,672
- I've got a plan.
- What, now he's got a plan?

335
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,711
For my ma, everyone's got a plan.

336
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,591
I hope you're not thinking
what I hope you're not thinking.

337
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,074
What do you hope
he's not thinking?

338
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,839
- Make the call to her.
- I'm not making the call.

339
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,838
You're making the call.
Now make the fucking call.

340
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,950
- What call?
- It will ruin the whole night.

341
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,549
It's not your night, Turtle,
it's Vince's. Make the call.

342
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,511
Fuck.

343
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,597
- What time is it back east?
- 10:30.

344
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,191
Someone tell me how you did this.

345
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,470
- Quit your whining.
- Seriously.

346
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,078
Why ruin the surprise?

347
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,430
Just worry about how you're gonna
get Ma to my next big event.

348
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,916
The good news is you'll have
plenty of time to plan for that one.

349
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,351
You're funny.

350
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,919
I can't believe this.
How did you do it?

351
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,109
Holy shit!

352
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,714
Hysterical!

353
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,478
Yeah, it's real funny.

354
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,114
Best pussy night of the year
and we just destroyed it.

355
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,079
Always hugs him first.
I am your firstborn, Ma.

356
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,554
- Did you bring a dress, Ma?
- I'm gonna wear this.

357
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,955
- Fucking idiot.
- Nice way to travel.

358
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,036
Where is Sloan? I'm dying to meet her.

359
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,753
Soon, Mom. Tonight at the premiere.

360
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,916
I'm glad I came.
This is gonna be fun.

361
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,354
- Limo's coming at 6:30.
- I'll be back.

362
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,392
- Pick up my suit from the tailor?
- I'm going to the fucking tailor!

363
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,353
To pick up the new fucking $5,000 suit
that I fucking paid for.

364
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,830
What? I've heard a lot worse
come out of your wife's mouth, Phil!

365
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,312
Oh, my God.

366
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,239
When you do a comic book character
it's critical that everything be real.

367
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,477
We had to devise a way
for Vince to breathe underwater.

368
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,589
- Do you have our tickets?
- We couldn't get 'em.

369
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,790
- Who's that animal?
- What do you mean?

370
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,391
- I got my hair pressed for this shit.
- Next time, ladies, next time.

371
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,716
I play Avedon,
a brutal and corrupt businessman

372
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,512
hellbent on world domination,

373
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,189
so I'm not sure how much
I really identify with such a character.

374
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,074
Oh, hey!
Whoa, look at this! Look at this.

375
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,714
Now, here's the real star
of the Chase family,

376
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,432
Johnny Chase.

377
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,000
God, this guy...
Did you ever see Viking Quest?

378
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,918
You're probably too young.
I love this guy!

379
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,951
Johnny Chase,
nice to see you.

380
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,752
OK, buddy, take it easy.

381
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,030
- Big movie, you look handsome.
- Thank you.

382
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,991
- And you look lovely.
- Thank you.

383
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,873
- So tell me, how do you feel?
- I feel great.

384
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,797
I'm so proud to be part of this movie

385
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,832
and James Cameron is simply a genius.
What can I say?

386
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,269
Yes, he is. He's coming up right behind you.

387
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,231
OK, don't party too late tonight.

388
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,795
If they don't like the movie,
reshoots 8:00am tomorrow, OK?

389
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,715
- He's serious too.
- Go get 'em, Vinnie.

390
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,275
- He looks good out there.
- He's gonna be a huge star.

391
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,390
- You really believe that?
- I know it.

392
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,750
- Vincent, over here!
- I trust you.

393
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,758
- But still no lobsters.
- I love you.

394
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,749
English
