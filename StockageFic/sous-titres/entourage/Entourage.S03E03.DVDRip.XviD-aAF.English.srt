1
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,118
- How's that seafood tower treating you?
- Delicioso, Ari. You outdid yourself this time.

2
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,550
This dinner's even better than the one
when you signed Vince.

3
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,639
He wasn't around for that one,
so he's ordering three types of caviar.

4
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,753
Until I see your credit card,
you're still a dine-and-dash candidate.

5
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,032
Seriously, the guy's all right,
he pulled out all the stops. Thank you.

6
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,995
Vinnie is officially a superstar, number one
movie in the country, theme park ride.

7
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,996
Thank you. Cheers.

8
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,031
- Raise it up.
- Congratulations.

9
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,837
- So tell us about the ride, Ari.
- Aquaman the ride.

10
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,872
Water theme, obviously.
Studio is going nuts over it.

11
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,559
- Did you see the commercial?
- No. Do I have to go?

12
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,750
Head of studio's going, you're going.

13
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,598
I'll go to see you doing Mach 10
in a water flume.

14
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,038
I don't do thrill rides.

15
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,390
Not since I rode the partner's daughter
in the mail room in '86.

16
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,591
You know what, you don't do the ride,
I don't do the park.

17
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,030
Blockbuster clout has made this boy shrewd.

18
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,071
Another toast to that!

19
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,312
So where are we hitting next?

20
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,874
Home. I need at least 45 minutes to digest.

21
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,878
- I've gotta hurry home too.
- What's the problem?

22
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,150
My daughter has a boy over.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,399
That's so cute.

24
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,352
It's not cute. You know who it is?
It's Max Ballard.

25
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,960
- The kid from Young 21 Jump Street?
- Good show.

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,834
- Wasn't he in rehab for Vicodin addiction?
- Hey, moron, he's 13.

27
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,317
- In celeb years, that's like 30.
- What does that make you, Drama? 140?

28
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,749
So you're admitting I'm a celeb.

29
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,551
That's bullshit, Drama.

30
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,479
Just because the guy put the doggie bag
in front of you, doesn't mean it's yours.

31
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,512
You said it yourself,
possession is nine tenths of the law.

32
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,075
This glorious 32oz porterhouse
is in my possession.

33
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,917
- What's that?
- Get off it!

34
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,955
Damn!

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,037
- Too slow, Turtle.
- Which one of you left the door open?

36
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,789
- That would be the meat stealer.
- I don't think so. I was first out.

37
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,957
You were till you ran back in
to splash some more Drakkar.

38
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,836
Arnold don't sound too happy.

39
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,916
- I'm gonna call Westec.
- Forget it.

40
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,033
- Rent-a-cops move slower than real ones.
- So you're just gonna go in?

41
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,759
Life is for the adventures, E.

42
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,194
Maybe we should leave Vince in the car.

43
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,357
If something happens to him, we're all fucked.

44
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,916
Do you smell something?

45
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,359
Is that sausage?

46
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,188
No, that's gourmet kielbasa.
It's been ageing for three days.

47
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,356
I was gonna surprise you guys.

48
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,630
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

49
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,476
- Wait, wait. You go first. We'll come behind.
- Why don't you go?

50
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,791
I can hear you assholes.

51
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,068
Dom?

52
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,031
Surprise, motherfuckers!

53
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,153
- What's up, bro?
- Give me some love, man.

54
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,752
Been on a bus for the last three days with your
pretty fucking picture on it, Vince. Ironic, huh?

55
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,509
You gotta learn to knock, bro.
You have no idea how close you came...

56
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,111
Close to what, Drama? You need more muscle
than you three and Aquaman to get me.

57
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,392
- What did you do to my dog?
- He's in the john eating a nice piece of meat.

58
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,429
Not my lamb chops?

59
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,229
Hey, Ebola. What's with you,
you infectious fucking disease?

60
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,716
You know I always hated that name, Dom.
How are you?

61
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,435
- How did you get out of prison?
- They let me out. Good behaviour.

62
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,313
Damn, you motherfuckers look good.

63
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,158
- It's been a long time. I missed you.
- We missed you too.

64
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,839
- We haven't been together since '98.
- At least.

65
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,475
- This calls for a celebration.
- I'll break out the Löwenbrau.

66
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,435
Take me out. I've been surrounded by nothing
but men for five years. Show me some pussy.

67
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,948
I think we can do that. Come on.

68
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,830
You come back here!

69
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,711
I hate you!

70
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,116
The director was really up my ass
during this scene.

71
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,628
Don't you dare slam that door!

72
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,711
I wanna live with my father!

73
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,273
It's 10:30, get him out.

74
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,438
- He's a nice boy, Ari, stop it.
- Nice boys don't have nine cars.

75
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,634
- You hear that?
- What?

76
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,429
Silence.

77
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,277
They've stopped talking.

78
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,833
I'm going in.

79
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,035
Hey, baby. Totally forgot
you had company. How's it going, Max?

80
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,435
- Hey, Mr Gold.
- What are you guys doing?

81
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,112
Max is showing me scenes
from his new movie. It's so good.

82
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,673
Thanks, babe.

83
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,591
- All right. Time to go.
- Daddy!

84
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,154
It's 10:30, honey, it's way too late. Come on.

85
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,069
- It's cool, Sarah, I'll just see you tomorrow.
- We're going to Six Flags tomorrow.

86
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,908
- I know, I'll be there too.
- Why will you be there?

87
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,430
Max is in talks about taking over
the Cody Banks franchise.

88
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,870
- My peeps think it's a good press op.
- It's gonna be a zoo, Max.

89
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,832
Want to be ripped limb from limb
by screaming fans?

90
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,908
You kidding? I love my fans. Later, dude.
I'll IM you late night. Ciao.

91
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,951
I'll walk you out.

92
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,912
In the joint, the homos on my tier
have pictures of you on the wall.

93
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,712
I told them, "I grew up with that little punk
you're whacking it to." They didn't believe me.

94
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,719
- That you knew the Chase brothers?
- They believed I knew you, Drama.

95
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,433
Why didn't you call? I'd have sent you a ticket.

96
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,189
I had a lot of loose ends to tie up.
Mostly parole board crap.

97
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,518
They had to give me permission
just to come out. Plus I wanted to surprise you.

98
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,473
Nothing like a good breaking and entering
to get the heart pumping.

99
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,078
How did you find the house?

100
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,473
Star maps.

101
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,351
How long are you staying for?

102
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,995
What's with this guy?
What is this? A fucking interrogation?

103
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,749
- What's your problem?
- He just got here, you ask when he's leaving.

104
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,439
Stay as long as you want, Dom,
we've got space.

105
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,917
Thanks, Vince. It's nice to know
you're still there for me. It's been a rough road.

106
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,511
You come out of the joint, a lot of people
you thought were your friends, they're not.

107
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,994
I guess it's hard to love a felon.

108
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,508
Anyway, before I get all misty like a queer,

109
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,755
why don't you hook me up
with some easy ass?

110
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,112
Come on, I'll take a lap with you,
show you my skills. You can come too, Drama.

111
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,549
Like I need an invitation.

112
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,471
- E, what you being a dick for?
- I'm not being a dick, I just don't trust him.

113
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,150
- You don't like that he calls you E. Coli?
- It's Ebola and that's nothing to do with it.

114
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,318
- We've known him our whole lives.
- It's that I know him that worries me.

115
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,636
He shows up after we open at number one.
He wants something.

116
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,875
Look at the guilt he's throwing your way.

117
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,593
- I do owe him.
- You're not why he went to jail.

118
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,551
- It was my weed.
- Two joints.

119
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,909
He'd have got a day but he punched a cop.

120
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,951
He wouldn't have if it weren't for the joints.

121
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,276
- He'd have got knocked up, you know that.
- I don't know that.

122
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,279
What are you going to do
when he fucks up out here?

123
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,912
- Lf.
- OK. Lf.

124
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,397
Then I'll deal with it.
It will be my problem, not yours, OK?

125
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,714
Don't worry so much.

126
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,876
- We're number one, baby.
- Number one, baby.

127
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,831
Have fun.

128
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,199
She's still online.

129
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,109
So go tell her you secretly monitor her buddy
list. See how that affects trust issues.

130
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,793
- Daddy, what are you doing?
- Go back to sleep. My computer's on the fritz.

131
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,799
I'll have this back to you before the morning.
I love you.

132
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,874
All I said was that she had nice lips.

133
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,150
And you'd introduce them to your member.

134
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,193
- Where I come from that's a compliment.
- Hysterical, Dom.

135
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,869
Does it feel like we're back home?
Awesome to have you here, Dom.

136
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,151
- Yeah, Dom, awesome, bro.
- I'll catch you guys later.

137
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,555
Hold on. I got a little something for you.

138
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,228
I know you're the de facto leader of this crew,

139
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,910
so I want to give you this as a show of
my appreciation for letting me come out.

140
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,719
- He gave you a present. Be nice.
- What is it?

141
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,470
It's a screenplay. I wrote it in the joint.
It's about the last seven years of my life.

142
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,035
- You wrote it by hand?
- All 234 pages, my friend.

143
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,514
And it's perfect for your next movie, Vince.

144
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,154
If there's anybody that could play me, it's you.

145
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,751
Don't worry about that script making sense
cos it does, I read both Syd Field books.

146
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,189
He'll read it as soon as possible.

147
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,268
I appreciate it. Be careful with it, cos it's not
only my heart and soul, it's my only copy.

148
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,949
- Ever heard of a Xerox, Dom?
- Ever heard of not having cash?

149
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,436
Just don't smudge it.
You may see me angry like in the old days.

150
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,951
- E, don't make him mad.
- You remember how crazy the Dominator gets.

151
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,072
Fuck me, you fucker, fuck me!

152
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,556
Oh, yeah, you fuck me, fuck me hard.

153
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,393
Smack my ass.

154
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,396
Do you like that?

155
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,109
Oh, yeah. Oh, you like that?

156
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,155
You like that?

157
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,237
- You hear this guy, E?
- People in Encino are hearing this guy.

158
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,349
Hysterical.

159
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,472
Yeah, waking up thinking
somebody's being murdered.

160
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,035
He's been out of commission for five years,
he's making up for it.

161
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,919
Oh, God.

162
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,269
Two minutes more,
he'd have had my record beat.

163
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,949
- Who's he got up there?
- It's one of those Aileen Wuornos types

164
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,036
he met at an inter-prison mingler.

165
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,195
Good one.

166
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,435
- Morning, fellas.
- Come on!

167
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,913
- Jesus, Dom.
- Classic.

168
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,918
- Can't be bashful in the big house.
- We're not in the big house.

169
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,350
- I don't remember you being so uptight.
- I'm not uptight.

170
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,791
Maybe I'm confusing things.
Finished my script yet?

171
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,638
- I got it three hours ago.
- A simple no would do.

172
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,638
- The answer's no.
- You see? Uptight.

173
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,432
- See.
- So get on it, E.

174
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,995
- There could be genius in those pages.
- Yeah, E, get to work.

175
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,636
You didn't happen to write me in, did you?
I'm a prominent part of the neighbourhood.

176
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,989
You'll be in the sequel, Drama.

177
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,911
There you are, baby.

178
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,192
How are you? Some Tropicana here
if you want to replenish those fluids.

179
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,196
I got a Gatorade in the car.

180
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,435
So is this really where Aquaman lives?

181
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,075
And the front doors are down the hall,
so feel free to kick yourself out.

182
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,796
Good job. You've got to love
that LA Xpress paper.

183
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,039
Even though that wasn't the broad I ordered,
she fucked like a world champion.

184
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,594
What are you doing
with my Le Creuset, bro?

185
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,995
I'm going to use it to cook you breakfast.

186
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,756
That's not necessary, I do the cooking.

187
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,360
Poisoning us gives Drama a reason to live.

188
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:34,394
I cooked for 400 in the joint, you don't think
I can cook for four jerk-offs in Beverly Hills?

189
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,432
- Go sit down.
- You're a guest, Dom, I insist.

190
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,517
Drama, let go of the pan
or I'll plant it in your head.

191
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,597
You guys are up early.
What's going on?

192
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,074
- Dom offered to cook us breakfast.
- He insisted.

193
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,317
Let him cook us breakfast, Johnny.
Take the day off.

194
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,193
- How do you like your eggs, Vin?
- Surprise me, Dom.

195
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,312
Do me a favour. Put on some underwear.

196
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,552
Never mind.

197
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,832
Ari, you're acting insane.

198
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,954
There's a movie star that has his sights
set on our baby girl and I'm acting insane?

199
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,798
- He's 13.
- Yeah, but in celeb years that's like 30.

200
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,877
How will you tell her
that she can't go to the water park?

201
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,311
Tell her that there's a drought
and the entire park dried up. I don't care.

202
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,148
- No, this is your thing. You're going to tell her.
- Tell her what?

203
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,156
Nothing, baby, nothing.

204
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,317
When are we leaving for the water park?
Max wants to know.

205
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,791
- You know that I love you?
- Of course.

206
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,755
And it's out of love when I tell you that I don't
want you coming to the water park today.

207
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,270
- And I don't want you seeing Max any more.
- Why not?

208
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,790
- Because he's an actor and actors are bad.
- But...

209
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,116
- I know this. I work with them all day.
- Mom used to be an actor.

210
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,958
And now she's not, that's why now she's good.

211
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,549
You're being unfair. I really like him.
You can't keep us apart.

212
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,433
- Well, I can certainly try.
- Mom...

213
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,199
- Your father...
- I hate you guys. I hate you!

214
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,835
Congratulations.
You've just won 50,000 in child therapy.

215
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,556
In this town as long as I keep her off an E!
True Hollywood Story, I've done my job.

216
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,759
You just don't use another man's deodorant.
Period.

217
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,439
- I used Vince's this morning.
- Not a roll-on.

218
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,790
Drama, I apologise, my mistake.
Are you gonna forgive me?

219
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,354
Drama, the guy apologised, forgive him.

220
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,712
- Why is everyone against me all of a sudden?
- Just get in the car.

221
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,070
- What are you doing?
- Driving.

222
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,352
- I do the driving around here, Dom.
- Really? How do you drive with one arm?

223
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,628
One arm?

224
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,671
Dead arm like in the old days.
That's gonna leave a mark.

225
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,756
- No shit.
- Don't cry, hit me back.

226
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,438
- I don't want to.
- Hit him.

227
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,313
- I want to drive.
- When did you get so territorial?

228
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,749
"I do the cooking, I do the driving."

229
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,951
We're neighbourhood guys, we share.
You gone pussies?

230
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,310
Turtle, I haven't been behind the wheel of a car
in a long time.

231
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,956
Vinnie. It's been five years since
I've been behind the wheel of a car. I miss it.

232
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,070
Go ahead. Drive.

233
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,111
Why, what's the big deal?

234
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,874
Looks like I'm not the only one laid off, bro.

235
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,595
Years of service and this is the thanks I get?

236
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,918
- Quit whining, Turtle.
- Easy for you to say, you got a window seat.

237
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,714
- Turtle, get your elbow out of my spleen.
- You fucking stink, Drama.

238
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,036
Because I'm not wearing
any fucking deodorant.

239
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,036
We need gas.

240
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,078
- I want him out.
- So do I. What do you wanna do?

241
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,634
- I want you to tell him.
- I want you to tell him!

242
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,477
Fine, pussy, I'll tell him.

243
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,314
What the fuck are you two looking at?

244
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,751
I guess you'll tell him later.

245
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,031
It's a big public event,
you may want to tell him how to behave.

246
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,275
It's a water park, E, what could he do?

247
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,118
- We've been to a water park with him.
- Don't start.

248
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,152
Six Flags. He almost killed Ryan, dunking him.

249
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,715
- He didn't know he had asthma.
- He had an inhaler around his neck!

250
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,716
- You always defend him.
- I get it.

251
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,716
Just talk to him, please.

252
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,548
- Let's hit the fucking flume, boys.
- Let's do it.

253
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,158
He stole that, by the way.

254
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,153
- What the fuck are you whispering about?
- Nothing.

255
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,556
Good. Then get the fuck in the car
and let's hit it.

256
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,351
Make some room.

257
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,876
There he is. All right. You made it.

258
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,959
E, got your lifts? I'd hate to see you sidelined
by the height requirement.

259
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,436
I'll laugh when we're on the ride
and you have a panic attack.

260
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,677
Not if Xanax has anything to say about it,
you won't.

261
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,029
Vince, I nearly cut the ribbon myself.

262
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,469
- Sorry we're late, Shauna.
- Who are you?

263
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,195
- Is there a man behind this beautiful belly?
- Is he kidding me?

264
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,879
- Oh, you two are...
- Oh, please.

265
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,391
Girls, this is my boy from back home. Dom.
Shauna, Christy. This is Ari.

266
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,351
You girls gonna ride with us?

267
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,868
If I wanted to induce, I'd be at the hospital.

268
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,198
Sit next to me. I've always wanted to be
involved in the birthing process.

269
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,719
That's disgusting.

270
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,194
Sit next to me. I'll take care of you, Christy.

271
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,673
Even more disgusting.

272
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,154
- Hey! Over here.
- Back off.

273
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,111
What are you doing, jerk-off?

274
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,831
Jesus Christ!

275
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,677
- He stole that candy too.
- What?

276
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,269
- It's OK. Give him back his camera. Sorry.
- Thanks, Vince.

277
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,719
Come here.

278
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,395
Take the picture.

279
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,590
Sorry about that, all right?

280
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,154
- I'm sorry, man.
- That's all right.

281
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,350
Come on, let's go. We've got things to do.

282
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,676
- Is he kidding me?
- I'll talk to him. I'll talk to him.

283
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,191
On behalf of Magic Mountain, we'd like
to present you with this key to our park.

284
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,231
To Aquaman, Vincent Chase.

285
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,791
We've got to talk.

286
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,078
So talk.

287
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,239
It's a family matter, E.

288
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,918
Yes, not for inquiring minds.

289
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,758
I'm sure it's really intriguing, Turtle.

290
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,791
I'll be right back.

291
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,714
I've got some family business
to take care of too.

292
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,390
- I'll miss all the excitement, Ari.
- I'd work on that attitude for the kid's sake.

293
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,352
- What's up?
- We took a vote.

294
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,072
- The two of you?
- That's right.

295
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,113
The tribe has spoken. We think
it's time for Dom to push off our island.

296
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,119
Isn't it awesome having him around?! You
haven't been so happy since we got Arnold.

297
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,232
- Well, things have changed.
- Five just don't work, E.

298
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,236
Four is a perfect number.

299
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,113
By the way, he stole that candy bar.

300
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,196
- What?
- Ask Turtle.

301
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,639
I ain't a rat.

302
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,831
- We just don't want him around no more.
- Vince does.

303
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,950
- So we get a minivan?
- He's on parole.

304
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,879
He has to go back eventually.
We just gotta ride it out.

305
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,559
...it will blow your mind. It is crazy.

306
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,434
I'm super-excited. I hope you enjoy the ride.

307
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,356
Come on. Give it up for Vince.

308
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,678
Make some fucking noise.

309
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,070
- Excuse Max, it's time for his Accutane.
- What are you doing, Gold?

310
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,750
- You two-timing my daughter?
- What? No. Me and Sarah aren't exclusive.

311
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,918
I'd prefer it if you were nothing at all.
Stay away from my daughter.

312
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,750
- Keep dreaming.
- Maxi, listen to me, or I will squash you. OK?

313
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,396
You gonna do that with your five-man agency?
Don't make threats you can't keep.

314
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,474
Come on, Ari. Flume of doom awaits, baby.

315
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,513
They say it's hell, Ari.
Seriously, take this just in case.

316
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,317
So what's the rule?
The slower the rise, the quicker the fall?

317
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,839
Yeah, something like that.

318
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,357
This is sick!

319
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,710
I guess I shouldn't have had
that second chilli dog.

320
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,233
Jesus.

321
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,394
You OK, Ari?

322
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,953
Great, Dom.

323
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,197
So what kind of fruit name is Ari, anyway?

324
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,153
I spoke to Drama and Turtle about Dom.
I'm not the only one worried.

325
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,668
- I talked to him, E.
- Yeah? What did he say?

326
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,950
It's all good. He totally gets it.

327
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,069
Great.

328
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,192
What's the deal with parolees,
how long do they stay out?

329
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,231
As long as he wants if he gets a job.

330
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,478
- Good thing he doesn't have one.
- Actually, I made him head of my security.

331
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,870
I owe him, E. I owe him.

332
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,278
Motherfucker!

333
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,749
English
