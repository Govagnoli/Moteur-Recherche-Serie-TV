1
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,911
Why, Ari, why?

2
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,872
- I'm in bed, E. Talk dirty to me.
- It's five in the morning.

3
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,592
- What are you wearing?
- Fuck you.

4
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,596
I love it when you say "fuck." Say it again.

5
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,437
Come on, E. It's game day, buddy.

6
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,232
Wake up. This is our tradition.

7
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,350
Only this time, we're playing for keeps.

8
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,834
No Pixar squirrel is going to stop us.

9
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,632
It's number one or bust, kid.

10
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,399
- You sound confident.
- Not a worry in the world.

11
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,989
- So what are we hoping for?
- 95 mil is what they're projecting.

12
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,237
- And what's good?
- 95 mil, Eric. That would be good.

13
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,669
Expectations.
Beat 'em by a dollar, great.

14
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,315
Under by a dollar, put a gun in your mouth
and make sure I'm behind you.

15
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,237
OK, keep in touch, Ari.

16
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,952
Game day, baby. No go, no go.

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,436
- You'll talk dirty to E...
- Come on.

18
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,277
- It's been three weeks.
- I know.

19
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,754
Just after we open, baby. Then we're all good.

20
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,873
And if we don't open?

21
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,110
If we don't open?
If we don't open? What do you mean by that?

22
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,790
Would you say that to a fighter? "You may get
knocked out. See you if you're not in a coma"?

23
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,798
Don't jinx this, baby. Not today.

24
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,677
Three soft-boiled eggs,

25
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,393
boiled chicken, wheat toast with jam.

26
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,675
It's not a signature Johnny Drama breakfast,

27
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,597
but nothing will upset your stomach.

28
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,553
- Thanks, Johnny, but I'm not stressed.
- You're hiding it, bro.

29
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,912
This is a big one. You may not know
you're stressed but trust me, you are stressed.

30
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,394
Moviefone says there's at 2:30 in Northridge.

31
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,399
The Valley? What are you, crazy?
Lt'll reach 100 degrees in the city today.

32
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,079
Vince wants to go to an out-of-the-way place.

33
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,872
Vince, you know my policy.

34
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,071
Except for work, I only go
to the Valley November through March.

35
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,712
Even then, only the sushi row.

36
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,320
Come on, Johnny, go for me.

37
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,273
- I'd better hydrate.
- What do you think we'll open at, Vin?

38
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,880
- Oh, God.
- Come on. I don't play this game.

39
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,990
Let's fuck around a little. Pick a number.

40
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,474
- Stop freaking him out.
- I'm not freaking out.

41
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,830
I know we'll open.
It's a foregone conclusion. I'm not worried.

42
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,270
- So pick a number.
- OK.

43
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,675
50 million.

44
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,439
- Would that be good?
- That would be terrible, Vince.

45
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,710
- Really?
- This movie opens at $50 million,

46
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,558
- we're working at Del Taco on Monday.
- What do we need?

47
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,319
- The studio's projecting 95.
- 95? Nice.

48
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,920
Fuck 95. I got a little projection of my own.

49
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:01,156
114,844, 117.

50
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,873
- How is that?
- $1 more than Spider-Man made.

51
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,354
We do any less, I'll consider the movie a flop.

52
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,073
Idiot. Spider-Man
is the biggest movie opening ever.

53
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,750
Plus Spider-Man had a much bigger fan base
than Aquaman to begin with. Can't happen.

54
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,793
We got James Cameron.
And those eyes. It can happen.

55
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,276
- Think we got a shot to topple Spidey, E?
- Let's just topple 95.

56
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,357
I'll tell you what, if we do beat Spider-Man,

57
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,073
y'all are getting something sick, know that.

58
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,156
- How sick?
- What do you mean by sick?

59
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,668
It's all in there. Listen...

60
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,191
- It's not even ten and it's burning up out there.
- I know. My widget says it's 96 already.

61
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,435
What's a widget? Why are you sitting like that?

62
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,119
- Are you wearing a butt plug?
- No!

63
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,720
I brought you this for luck
on the opening today.

64
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,791
What is this, a little Tae Bo instructor?

65
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,116
That is an authentic 12th-century
Yong Shi warrior, Ari.

66
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,835
A Mongolian symbol of strength.
If you carry him, you cannot be stopped.

67
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,236
This is Hollywood. The only thing
Mongolian is barbecue, but thanks.

68
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,352
And... I got you
in with Dr Marcus at 4:30.

69
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,596
- Dr Marcus?
- Yeah.

70
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,791
Your wife called and said she needed
an emergency session.

71
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,990
Why didn't you tell her I didn't have time?

72
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,349
- Because you do have time.
- Why didn't you lie?

73
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,277
Cos I'm scared of your wife, Ari.

74
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,393
Yeah, me too. Maybe if I rub
this little guy's balls, she'll disappear.

75
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,800
We're going to the Valley, Drama,
not the Sahara.

76
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,755
Don't kid yourself, E. North of Ventura
Boulevard is Hell's waiting room. Be prepared.

77
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,917
We'll have to stop every 20 feet
for you to take a leak.

78
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,871
That's what the empties are for.

79
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,832
Don't even think about pulling
your dick out in my car.

80
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,591
Aquaman's making waves, pal.

81
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,471
The first East Coast numbers are in.

82
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,273
They're projecting 100 mil.

83
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,799
That is great news.

84
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,956
The movie gods are smiling on us today.

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,468
It's still early. We can do better, right?

86
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,308
I thought I was greedy. The over-and-under
is 95. We hit 100, I got wood.

87
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,954
I'm just saying.
I mean, Spider-Man did what, 114?

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,912
- Is there any way we can beat that?
- Spider-Man?

89
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,394
Who said anything about Spider-Man?

90
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,958
Eric. Tell me that Vinnie doesn't think
we'll beat the biggest opening in movie history.

91
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,629
I'll tell you what.
Manage your client's expectations.

92
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,319
Do your job. Thank you for ruining my day.

93
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,829
We all good?

94
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,156
- I thought you're not worried about that stuff.
- I'm not.

95
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,839
I don't wanna know anything till it's official.

96
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,553
- Can't we know?
- Let's roll.

97
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,152
103...

98
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,349
My God.

99
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,960
- 104!
- Unbelievable.

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,353
- Shit.
- 105.

101
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,470
- Eat that, Drama.
- Inhuman.

102
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,557
I guess it's true,
the heat really does affect the elderly.

103
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,276
Yeah, Drama, I haven't seen somebody
sweat like that since Patrick Ewing retired.

104
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,353
Great Mother of God.

105
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,118
- Fuck. Dude, we got a monster, Vince.
- It's one theatre. Don't get crazy.

106
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,833
- How will we get seats?
- Who are you talking to?

107
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,270
There's four taped off for us in the back
as we speak.

108
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,788
And all it cost us...

109
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,229
was a signed copy of the new Aquaman game.

110
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,633
Nice job, Turtle.

111
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,274
I'm making a run for cooler pastures.

112
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,596
What do you think?

113
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,358
They're loving it.

114
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,790
Wait till they get a load of
the end of this scene.

115
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,751
Christ, where's this jerkoff going?

116
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,075
Hey, pal. You wanna sit down?

117
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,588
You're about to miss the best part of the movie.

118
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,677
I have to use the bathroom.

119
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,188
Sit down.

120
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,479
I dropped my monkey!

121
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,715
No, come back!

122
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,992
Here it comes!

123
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,358
- What the fuck?
- Shit, projector must have gone out.

124
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,470
It's not just the projector.

125
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,636
We lost the central air.

126
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,069
...waiting for two hours!

127
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,630
Sorry, folks. It's a blackout.

128
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,031
Please calmly file into the lobby
and we'll refund your money.

129
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,957
Refund their money?
They already saw half the movie. Fuck that.

130
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,434
- Shut the fuck up!
- Give them free popcorn!

131
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,638
- Holy crap! Aquaman!
- Dude, what are you doing here?

132
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,071
- Just checking out the movie like you guys.
- Who's guarding the throne of Poseidonis?

133
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,758
It's about to be a madhouse here.

134
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,109
- I'm gonna go get the car.
- Fire up the AC.

135
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,879
The movie's great.
We caught the ten am showing too.

136
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,592
That harpoon fight was badass.

137
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,234
- Hear that? They thought I was badass.
- I heard.

138
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,592
Vince, was that seahorse you rode
animatronic or computer generated?

139
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,198
Animatronic.

140
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,798
Yes! You owe me 20.

141
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,070
That is him!

142
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,271
- My God!
- Can I have your autograph, Vince?

143
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,232
We made it.

144
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,432
Now, let's get back to civilisation. Please.

145
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,792
I begged you to take the 101,

146
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,478
but you had to take the Canyon.

147
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,478
- It's more scenic.
- Just get me home, please.

148
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,988
All the lights are out, Drama. What shall I do?

149
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,749
You know, it looks like the whole area
is blacked out. I'm gonna call Ari.

150
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,038
Hey, I was just dialling you.

151
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,469
That must mean we're destined to be in love.

152
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,431
Yeah. You having a blackout too?

153
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,632
Not since I took four Quaaludes and forgot
I fucked Chantal Lautenberg. Why?

154
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,355
We're in Northridge. It's blacked out.
Will this affect the numbers?

155
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,198
I didn't even know Northridge
survived the '94 quake.

156
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,310
Don't worry about that. You with Vinnie?

157
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,674
Be very cool.

158
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,395
Do not get him excited,
but the first West Coast numbers are in,

159
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,396
- and they're big.
- Go on.

160
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,193
- Eight-legs big, bitch.
- Get the fuck out of here.

161
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,518
The webcrawler is in our sights, Eric,
and I want to squash that fucker!

162
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,710
So do I, Ari. All right, thanks.

163
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,631
What?

164
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,115
Nothing.

165
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,232
- Fuck you, nothing. What?
- Not until it's official, right?

166
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,795
Fuck official.
I don't want you to know anything I don't.

167
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,193
Is it Spider-Man?

168
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,231
- Spidey, E?
- Say something, dick.

169
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,590
Speak now or I'm throwing you
out of the car.

170
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,398
Spider-Man is in our sights.

171
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,472
I knew it! Fuck you, Tobey!

172
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,432
- It's not definite though, Vince.
- Yeah, I know.

173
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,914
Cool. Let's buy some toys
anyway to celebrate.

174
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,477
I know a place.

175
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,273
But not in the Valley.
They got toys in the city, Vince.

176
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,072
How do you know this area, Turtle?

177
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,475
Best rub-and-tug in California was next door.

178
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,239
They probably moved
to Santa Monica where it's cool.

179
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,793
There she is.

180
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,159
- Ducatis.
- Sweet.

181
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,832
This is the one for me, Vince,
the fastest production bike on the road.

182
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,359
It's yours.

183
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,996
I appreciate it, but I'm not a motorcycle guy,
and I'm not gonna take a gift just to take it.

184
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,837
You neither, Johnny?

185
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,997
- You know I hate rice rockets, Vince.
- Ducati's Italian.

186
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,238
Regardless, it's still a foreign job.
I'm a Harley man.

187
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,510
Didn't you have one when you came here?

188
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,473
Yeah, I had to hock it to Michael Madsen
after a couple of bleak pilot seasons.

189
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,748
God, I loved that bike.

190
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,678
Why don't we go and make him
an offer he can't refuse?

191
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,517
You serious?

192
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,838
God, you're a fucking prince, bro.

193
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,599
You know, he's also got a watch of mine.

194
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,676
Mr Chase, have you decided yet?

195
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,312
Yes, we have.

196
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,271
We'll take four of these.

197
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,709
Maybe you guys will grow to love 'em.

198
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,389
Not again.

199
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,396
So when is the last time you had sex?

200
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,637
- With each other or...
- If you're not taking this seriously...

201
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,955
I am. It's just, for the money we're spending,

202
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,072
I could get you a pro
to service your most bizarre fetishes.

203
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,475
- See? This is what I'm dealing with.
- Come on.

204
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,793
Don't.

205
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,637
It's Vince.

206
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,878
Don't you feel that a lacking sexual relationship
is a big problem in a marriage?

207
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,072
I do, Doc, but we fuck more
than any other married couple you know.

208
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,749
And I know this because, whenever
we go out with another married couple

209
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,477
and the subject comes up, they always say,
"I can't believe how often you guys fuck."

210
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,670
- It's Vince, baby.
- I don't give a fuck.

211
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,510
You know, after the year that I've had
and on the most important day of my life,

212
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,472
you'd think that she would ask me
what I wanted?

213
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,112
A nice blow job, perhaps,

214
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,197
where I could just sit back
for the first time in nine months

215
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,756
and do nothing but admire the top of her head
and pray that this fucking movie opens

216
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,713
so I can stop selling off assets
like we're fucking Michael Jackson.

217
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,352
I have to answer the Batphone

218
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,757
when it rings three fucking times
and it's fucking Vince, OK?

219
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,756
Eric, speak.

220
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,189
There's been another blackout in the Valley.

221
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,711
You need a fucking night-light? Get back over
the hill. And don't call me back unless...

222
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,990
- Fuck me.
- What's going on, Ari?

223
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,951
I'm gonna call you back.

224
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,677
Can we prorate this session, please?

225
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,959
- He's gonna call us back.
- Anything to worry about?

226
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,148
Great.

227
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,760
We're being stalked by Devo.

228
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,473
- This isn't a coincidence.
- No, we followed you.

229
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,078
- Replenish.
- We wanted to know

230
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,951
if you guys wanted to come to a party.

231
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,558
It's our big graduation bash.

232
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,750
High school party? Sorry, kid,

233
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,997
we don't go to parties where
the girls ain't legal.

234
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,076
Although we do like 'em barely legal.

235
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,078
Come on, Vince, come with us.
It'll be like Almost Famous.

236
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,839
- Hey, I like that movie.
- Vince, I'm burning up here.

237
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,916
Another hour and my kidneys may shut down.

238
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,871
They've got a pool.

239
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,115
- Really?
- Yeah, it'll be great.

240
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,879
It'll be a lot easier to get in
with you there, Vince.

241
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,957
So that's it? You guys need Vince
to get you into the party.

242
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,151
Turtle, you still can't
get into Teddy's without Vince.

243
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,715
- Do you wanna go?
- Fuck it. It'll take hours to get home anyway.

244
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,910
So you'll come?

245
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,916
- Yeah, we'll come.
- All right!

246
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,599
Aquaman to the rescue!

247
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,111
Did kids look this young
when we went to school?

248
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,993
- In Drama's eighth year they did.
- Six years, assholes.

249
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,349
And like I did for these maggots, I'll do for you.

250
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,233
Someone gives you guys a hard time
about being here,

251
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,191
Johnny Drama's got your back.

252
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,232
Thanks. There are some really
tough kids at this school.

253
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,236
Come on, I'm from New York.

254
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,236
Who the fuck let nerds in my house?

255
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,316
- Here we go.
- Drama's gonna get his ass kicked.

256
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,271
- Hey, Kessler.
- Who let you losers in?

257
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,278
- These guys are with us.
- Who the fuck are you?

258
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,314
He's my brother. Sorry, we were just passing
by, we saw the party, we figured we'd drop in.

259
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,874
Holy shit. You're Vince Chase.

260
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,148
You're with these two?

261
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,709
Jay and Reggie? They're my cousins.
It's cool. We'll find another party.

262
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,352
Oh, no. No, you stay.

263
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,631
Reggie and Jay, stay.
This old guy, he can stay too.

264
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,553
- You need a beer, Vince?
- That'd be good.

265
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,393
- Thanks.
- Holy shit, Vince Chase.

266
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,989
Hey, everyone,
fuckin' Aquaman is at my house!

267
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,633
Give me something good, Ari.

268
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,433
There's nothing good at all, E.
Nothing good.

269
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,190
- Why? What's happening?
- Massive, rolling blackouts from the heat.

270
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,233
They're hitting the whole fucking coast
from San Francisco down to San Diego.

271
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,397
Shit. Well, I guess we can kiss
Spider-Man goodbye.

272
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,150
Forget Spider-Man. I just named two of
the most populated cities in the whole country.

273
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,794
- So what does that mean, Ari?
- That we are fucked.

274
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,675
We took a massive hit on the midday numbers
and now they are projecting 85.

275
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,598
Jesus Christ. What am I gonna tell Vince?

276
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,952
What you've been saying all day. Nothing!
Keep your mouth shut until it's official.

277
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,276
- When's that gonna be?
- In a few hours, all right?

278
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,356
I want you to email me your address

279
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,358
and I will come and tell him with you, all right?

280
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,873
What happened to the music?

281
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,832
It's a blackout, baby! Into the pool!

282
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,313
Our moms say Reggie looked exactly like I did
when I was his age. You don't see it?

283
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,079
- A little, I guess.
- And you're related to Jay too?

284
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,318
We're practically like brothers.
You girls should take care of these two.

285
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,271
I'm gonna get a drink. Want anything?

286
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,709
- All good, Vince.
- Good to hear it, Reggie.

287
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,478
Jay.

288
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,797
Life is good!

289
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,875
Any word?

290
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,434
- No, nothing official.
- What does that mean?

291
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,994
An hour ago we're the biggest opening ever,
and now we're a disaster?

292
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,951
Yeah, well, fucking blackouts.

293
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,879
Fucking blackouts. This is why
I don't like to get caught up in this shit.

294
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,514
- You shouldn't let me get caught up in it.
- Come on.

295
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,711
I know, I know. I asked.

296
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,239
I'm sorry, buddy.

297
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,920
Look at these kids. This used to be us.

298
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,235
We used to talk about coming to Hollywood.

299
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,669
- It wasn't about money.
- No, it wasn't.

300
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,871
Fuck it. We're not gonna let this town
make it about money now.

301
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,275
- Let's get hammered.
- With 17-year-olds?

302
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,788
- We'll make their night.
- All right.

303
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,512
Blackouts?

304
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,471
Fucking blackouts?

305
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,994
Thank you very much!

306
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,037
The town will understand, Ari.
It's not the movie's fault.

307
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,993
Baby, it wasn't the Cubs' fault when that
douchebag grabbed the foul ball either,

308
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,554
but they still don't get
a World Series ring.

309
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,751
There are no asterisks in this life,
only scoreboards,

310
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,837
and ours is currently reading "Fucked".

311
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,950
There's nothing you can do about it now,

312
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,797
so why don't you sit down and relax?

313
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,957
I can't relax until I tell Vinnie.
I gotta go to the Valley.

314
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,479
After the call.

315
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,239
And who knows when that will be?

316
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,919
Isn't it a bit convenient
the kids are at your mother's?

317
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,556
Ari, I've been patient, but now,
whatever happens is totally out of your control.

318
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,479
So let's go upstairs.

319
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,397
Fine, but I'm not gonna like it.

320
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,351
Oh, really?

321
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,078
All right, I may like it just a little bit.

322
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,950
I don't want you to hear this. I could cry.

323
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,436
I have to go to the Valley.
I promise, when I get back, no matter what,

324
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,152
we'll dent that headboard.

325
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,590
I guarantee you,
you will not walk right tomorrow.

326
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,756
Tell me something good.

327
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,988
So you work with Vince?

328
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,996
Is it fun?

329
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,678
You don't talk much.

330
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,075
Not to high school girls. No offence.

331
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,238
I'm not in high school. This is my
little brother's party. I'm just chaperoning.

332
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,679
That was a real creepy turn.

333
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:08,037
You may have a couple pounds on me
but nothing outweighs experience.

334
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,310
You ready?

335
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,117
Are you ready?

336
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,675
Hey, everybody!

337
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,473
Do you know how good
your lives are right now?

338
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,952
My boys are here from high school
and we wish we could be back living like this!

339
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,716
- What the fuck is he doing?
- He wanted his Almost Famous moment.

340
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,151
- I told you not to say anything till it was official.
- What the fuck is the difference?

341
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,752
Ari is in the Valley?

342
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,755
Holy shit, we really must be fucked, huh?

343
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,633
What are they projecting now? 45, Ari?

344
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,989
- 116, actually.
- What?

345
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,077
- 116, kid!
- How's that possible?

346
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,759
You guys ever hear of a hanging chad?

347
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,795
Where the fuck am I? Listen,
the biggest thing the blackouts affected

348
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,070
were the actual reporting of the numbers.

349
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,150
- We beat Spider-Man?
- It's only Friday,

350
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,318
but if there isn't a tornado in the Midwest,
we've got a good shot, my friend.

351
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,229
Hey, everybody, you've got the biggest
movie star on the planet on your roof right now.

352
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,354
It's all you, baby!

353
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,276
- Number one, baby.
- Yeah! Do it!

354
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,033
So, whose dad is this?

355
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,389
I don't know.
Why don't you throw him in the pool?

356
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,433
Fuck you, throw me in the pool.
Hey, Kong, go get us some beers.

357
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,036
- Put him in! Put him in!
- Go, go!

358
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,717
You little fuck, these are $900 shoes!

359
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,315
You guys are not gonna believe this!

360
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,955
Those two girls? The most untouchable girls
in school. But guess what?

361
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,353
They like you.

362
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,550
They wanna hang in my basement.

363
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,595
Basement! Nice!

364
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,312
But we can't all fit on the Vespa.

365
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,238
You can't roll chicks in a Vespa, bro.

366
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,635
We were hoping maybe you could give us a lift.

367
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,908
A lift?

368
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,996
I can't do that.

369
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,758
But what I can do is this.

370
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,110
Turtle, give our new best friends
the keys to the Mas'.

371
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,479
There you go.

372
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,557
That is so cool!
You're lending us your car?

373
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,670
- No.
- How do we get it back to you?

374
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,599
You don't. You return it to
the Beverly Hills Maserati dealership.

375
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,596
Your lease ends at the end of August.

376
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,870
- No way.
- Holy shit.

377
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,311
That was actually refreshing,
but I have to go home to hammer the wife.

378
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,395
Give us a lift.

379
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,398
Anything to keep me away
from my house. Come on, bro.

380
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,715
We out.

381
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,351
The Valley ain't so bad.

382
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,789
