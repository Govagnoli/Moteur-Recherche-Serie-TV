1
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,158
I don't think you want
to go into that part of town,

2
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,191
not alone.

3
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,834
I'll go with you, Joe, if you want.

4
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,757
- What do you think?
- Sounds good.

5
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,189
- Yeah, for real?
- Very natural.

6
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,196
I think I'm gonna get this one.

7
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,470
You know, I feel like
it was written for me.

8
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,397
With Eddie Burns producing...

9
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,351
The guy knows me from back in the day.

10
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,833
Sure that's a good thing?

11
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,519
Don't listen, Johnny, I love the positivity.

12
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,835
- Thanks, Vince.
- You do sound good, Drama.

13
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,553
But don't count on Eddie Burns
knowing you. Focus.

14
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,953
You're right.

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,276
Focused. Like a laser.

16
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,880
No. No. OK, sorry.

17
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,994
Ari Gold's office. No...

18
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,553
Can I ask you to hold, please?

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,591
What's up? You look like hell.

20
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,076
The phones are ringing.
Everyone knows you took the new space.

21
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,192
- They're asking if we're a new major.
- Terence signed the papers.

22
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,472
- Deny, deny, deny. It'll all be over soon.
- You know I don't like to lie.

23
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,317
Lloyd, be a man.

24
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,670
Or as much of a man as you can
possibly be for God's fuckin' sakes.

25
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,597
Now what's up this morning?

26
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,872
- Vince and the boys are on their way.
- It's gonna be a good day. I can feel it.

27
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,039
Ari Gold's office.
No, I haven't heard anything about that.

28
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,868
I'll be here.

29
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,118
- You gonna make me hang alone?
- Sorry, bro. Audition's at 3:00.

30
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,954
- I'm a laser.
- You're a retard, but OK.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,037
No, that is so not true. So not true!

32
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,718
You guys can go right in.

33
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,877
Ari Gold's office, please hold.

34
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,753
I'll be out here all alone.

35
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,756
You having a telethon?

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,349
Raising cash for subordinates of
movie stars who can't fend for themselves.

37
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,470
What's the big surprise, Ari?

38
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,592
- Getting right to it, huh?
- Last time you surprised me, I was fired.

39
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,959
Naturally I'm anxious.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,073
Remember Queens Boulevard, that was
supposed to be released on six screens,

41
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,315
for NYU students on a Friday night?

42
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,511
The studio has decided to push the release.

43
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,039
- Why?
- What the fuck?

44
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,200
Because they want to release it wide
on 1,200 motherfuckin' screens!

45
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,879
E's lucky pick
has been testing through the roof

46
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,356
- and with the success of Aquaman...
- Two for two!

47
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,675
The Hollywood Foreign Press
wants to sit down,

48
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,508
discuss everything QB, wanna have
a press conference this afternoon.

49
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,152
Give me a little less notice!

50
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,715
When the Hollywood Foreign Press calls,
you run. Will you be there?

51
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,478
- I'll be there.
- Do something for me.

52
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,637
Will you smile?
Will you look happy and cooperative?

53
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,557
What does cooperative look like?

54
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,310
Vin, we need this. We want people to forget
that you just got fired.

55
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,396
Will you smile?

56
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,791
Hey, Eddie.
It's great to see you too.

57
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,193
Me?

58
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,038
Thanks, yeah,
things are great, just great.

59
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,230
Life is just so amazing, isn't it?

60
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,913
What the hell?

61
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,953
Maybe you didn't notice,
but I was sitting in the car.

62
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,598
I noticed. You didn't notice
the meter needed feeding.

63
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,154
What, no heads-up?
No tap on the window?

64
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,111
Sorry, pal.

65
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,435
The meter's red, the car is dead.

66
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,593
Civil servant?

67
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,757
What is civil about not giving a warning?
It's anti-American.

68
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,872
- I think that's in the Bill of Rights.
- This isn't Communist Russia.

69
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,309
Communist Russia isn't
Communist Russia any more.

70
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,512
- You wanna fuckin' start?
- Johnny, relax, I'll pay for the ticket.

71
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,676
That's not the point, it's the principle.

72
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,553
A guy should be able
to sit in his car on a public street

73
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,556
without being unjustly harassed.

74
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,754
- What are you doing?
- Fighting for my rights.

75
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,110
I'm gonna go down and make
that guy's day a living hell.

76
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,832
I thought you were a laser.

77
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,030
- This won't affect me.
- Forget him.

78
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,629
You're nervous. You get uptight
when you have something big.

79
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,069
You can get this if you stay focused.

80
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,352
- You're right.
- Right?

81
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,472
Yeah. You're right, bro. Thanks.

82
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,956
Turtle, let's get a cup of coffee,
head west so I'm not late. Thanks!

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,638
- You betcha.
- Hey, good luck.

84
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,477
Thanks, E.

85
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,553
- See how calming I can be?
- Yeah, very impressive.

86
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,909
- What should we do?
- Call Walsh, celebrate.

87
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,155
- Really?
- He'll be happy to hear from you.

88
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,034
Hillbilly Willy is coming on
as he passes Marshal Tito...

89
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,389
Hillbilly Willy is starting to come on...

90
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,954
Suit! What a pleasant
fucking surprise.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,434
- How you doing, Billy?
- I'm awful.

92
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,118
This will make you feel better.

93
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,628
Queens Boulevard is opening
on 1,200 screens.

94
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,875
- Willy is closing fast...
- Yes!

95
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,878
Run! Run, you fucking slag!

96
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,433
Come on!

97
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,072
Hello?

98
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,031
- It's Hillbilly by a nose!
- Fuck!

99
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,310
What a finishing kick on that horse!

100
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,193
Fucking fillies, Suit.
Never count on a broad.

101
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,435
Did you hear me, Billy?
1,200 screens.

102
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,233
Yeah, I fuckin' heard ya
and I already know.

103
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,193
Why do you think I'm blowing all my money
on booze and ponies? I'm depressed.

104
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,992
Billy, this is good news.

105
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,634
No, it ain't.
And it ain't gonna happen either.

106
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,716
I'm slapping those fucks with an injunction

107
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,513
to make sure
that film never sees the light of day.

108
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,869
He's trying to kill the release of the movie.

109
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,035
- What? Why?
- Why?

110
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,790
Because I'm not gonna
let those douchebags Aquaman-ify my movie.

111
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,070
Where are you?
We're gonna come see you.

112
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,476
Meet me at my girl's. I gotta tell her
I lost the rent money again.

113
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,158
It's not true, Shauna!

114
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,715
Tell Variety they can suck my balls,
but clean it up.

115
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,951
You Indian now, Lloyd?

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,672
Jesus, you can see this?

117
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,156
This lying is making me break out.
God, and I have a date tonight!

118
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,998
I'm sure your date will pop
that with his pecker.

119
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,431
- Tell me why you came in or get out.
- Barbara Miller's on three.

120
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,232
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

121
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,192
Out! I don't want to hear
your bitch-ass whiny voice again.

122
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,196
Do you understand? Go, go, go!

123
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,277
- Babs, what are you wearin'?
- We need to have lunch, Ari.

124
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,719
The word is out.

125
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,955
You mean that shit
about you getting lipo?

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,833
Dr Dessler's
like a fucking Picasso with that knife.

127
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,598
I'm coming to you as a friend.

128
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,677
People are mobilising against you
and you need to know.

129
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,553
Now do you want
a Caesar fucking salad or not?

130
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,155
Let me call you back, Barbara.

131
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,912
Speak, Lloyd.

132
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,712
You're not talking?

133
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,712
"Rob Rubino's
in the conference room."

134
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,673
- Terence fucking fired him?
- I did not say the "F" word.

135
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,109
My... I... we...

136
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,276
I don't have the sk... the skill set...

137
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,630
I can't understand your whimpering.
Why did Terence fire you?

138
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,272
- He knows.
- What does he know?

139
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,470
They saw your name on my call sheet.

140
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,080
- Fuck.
- They escorted me out of the building.

141
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,793
Then they gave
everybody employment contracts

142
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,628
and they had to sign them by 5:00pm
saying they wouldn't work for you.

143
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,240
- What should I do?
- I don't know!

144
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,840
But just stop fucking crying
so I can think, OK?

145
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,514
Call Barbara,
tell her I'll go to lunch.

146
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,117
You know, Eddie Burns offered
me Brothers McMullen.

147
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,669
True story. But I took
a TV show instead.

148
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,712
Was that when you did
your full-frontal Red Shoe Diary?

149
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,991
No, that's when I did
my three-episode arc on 90210,

150
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,951
sexually harassing Tori Spelling.

151
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,399
Nice choice.

152
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,278
- This can't be the right address.
- Look, there he is.

153
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,150
What is this, your house?

154
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,510
No, I'm house-sitting
for my girl's folks.

155
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,836
They made a fortune off
ginseng and kombucha drinks.

156
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,916
They won't let her see a dime of it.

157
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,838
I'm praying they die
before they raise the estate tax.

158
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,836
- How are you, Vince?
- Good, you?

159
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,269
- What happened to Queens Boulevard?
- They butchered her.

160
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,470
- They changed it?
- They murdered her.

161
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,988
You wanna see the body?

162
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,832
Take care of yourself.

163
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,433
Hey, you ever coming back?

164
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,958
You kidding?

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,639
I am Queens Boulevard.

166
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,272
Insane, ain't it?

167
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,470
Looks like Willy Wonka's factory.

168
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,590
You see why I have to do
what I have to do.

169
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,312
How could they ruin a great movie?

170
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,557
They're fucking animals
and they need to be put to sleep.

171
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,672
Sign the injunction and they'll know
we ain't fucking around.

172
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,314
- What do you think, E?
- We should call Ari.

173
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,590
One suit, two suit, three suit, four!

174
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,312
Billy, I'm with you, all right?

175
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,238
But we have to talk to somebody
before we sign an injunction.

176
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,352
Can't afford to be pissing off
another studio right now.

177
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,799
- Pussy.
- Asshole.

178
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,956
All right, guys, chill.

179
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,592
Call Ari.

180
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,990
So who's picking up
the tab on this little chow-down?

181
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,996
Relax, Ari, my treat.

182
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,830
Greetings, Ari.

183
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,749
I knew you liked dick, Babs.
I didn't know you were a cocksucker.

184
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,631
Please, join us.

185
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,556
It's like a meeting of the five families.

186
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,876
I shoulda had a gun taped up
in the bathroom stall.

187
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,638
Look, all the majors are here -

188
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,319
CAA, UTA, ICM,
Endeavor, William Morris.

189
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,271
Who the fuck invited APA?

190
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,153
- There it is.
- There's no spots.

191
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,111
Pull up in the red, I'll go grab one.

192
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,511
All right.

193
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,793
Cafe latte, 4.50.

194
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,115
Well, actually,
I'm on my 10th purchase,

195
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,311
paid for the last nine,
so you'll be paying for that, bad boy.

196
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,079
I won't, because we don't take
those any more.

197
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,109
What do you mean?

198
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,596
Too many people were
counterfeiting 'em, so we stopped.

199
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,349
Unfortunately, the only form
of currency I have is that card,

200
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,756
so accept that card
or you're gonna have to eat that drink.

201
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,156
I'm not gonna eat anything.
Anybody ordering a cafe latte?

202
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,270
- Right here.
- Hey, wait, hold on.

203
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,675
That... that's my drink.

204
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,870
Get me the manager.

205
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,558
Well, tell Ari when you find him

206
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,160
- he needs to call me back.
- I will indeed.

207
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,953
- Ari's MIA.
- What the fuck is he so busy with?

208
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,912
Press conference is in three hours.
We can't do nothing.

209
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,110
- Attaboy, Vince.
- Well, fuck Ari!

210
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,355
Fuck this injunction. We'll handle this.

211
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,755
- What do you have in mind?
- I got Jamie Burke's number.

212
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,713
Don't waste your minutes. I already called.
They ain't seeing nobody.

213
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,832
If they want to do another movie
with Vince, they'll see us.

214
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,758
I like your newfound balls, Suit.

215
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,715
My rapper's signing a big deal this month,
but I still have time to handle Vince as well.

216
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,159
Shit.

217
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,431
Excuse me. Can you leave
your number on the windshield?

218
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,031
- I'm afraid I have to ask you to leave.
- And I'm afraid I have to say no.

219
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,834
I ain't going anywhere till
I get my free cup of coffee!

220
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,110
Jesus Christ, Drama!
What the fuck?

221
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,196
They discontinued my free coffee card.

222
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,391
Listen, pal, I'll buy you
the lousy $3 cup of coffee.

223
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,274
- You want to get involved, dickhead?
- Drama, Drama, come on!

224
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,596
You don't need any more coffee.
You're wired up enough.

225
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,359
You only got 15 minutes
to get to Ed Burns.

226
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,958
Fuck it. Fuck all of you!

227
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,558
I'm gonna go get me a pilot!

228
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,319
But I will be back and you will give me
a free cup of coffee.

229
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,271
Oh, fuck, the car!

230
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,631
Come back here!

231
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,557
Turtle, call a cab!

232
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,797
Come on, Ari, you really think
we haven't been watching you?

233
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,276
- I don't know. Have you?
- Yes. We know what you've been up to.

234
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,072
- What?
- Why don't you tell us?

235
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,872
Why should I if you already know?

236
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,388
All right, this is getting us nowhere here.

237
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,352
Let me just say this.
I've known you for 20 years.

238
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,833
- Yeah.
- I always knew

239
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,838
that you were a smug little rat
with grand aspirations.

240
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,110
That's why it was such a shock
to see you

241
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,119
sitting in that little boutique agency of yours
for the last nine months.

242
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,517
But I guess - I've seen this before -
it's all a ruse in your master plan.

243
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,790
Master plan?

244
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,308
Look, Ari, simply put,

245
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,999
we're here to assure you
that the eight of us

246
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,156
who represent the power in this town,

247
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,509
are lined up to say

248
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,916
that if you go near one of our clients
or one of our agents

249
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,157
or even one of
our highly prized mailroom boys,

250
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,671
we will all come down on you
with the wrath of 10,000 suns.

251
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,871
You know what's interesting about that...

252
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,357
is that you used the words
"master plan" and "rat"

253
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,915
when talking about me,
you Hitler-loving, anti-Semitic cuntbag.

254
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,190
I can only hope

255
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,357
that 50% of the power at this table
is as offended as I am.

256
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,914
Ari! Is it true?

257
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,030
Come on. Yes or no.

258
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,756
You got me.
I'm setting up my own shop.

259
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,870
Thank you, thank you.

260
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,717
Ari Gold is back.

261
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,675
But I assure you, and I swear this
on my children's names,

262
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,953
I have no intention of going after
any of your clients or your agents.

263
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,434
- Only his.
- Really, Ari?

264
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,549
Really, Terence.

265
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,957
- With whose money will you fund this?
- Yours, you cockney fuck.

266
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,037
- You signed the settlement papers.
- Yes.

267
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,152
But I didn't sign any cheques and I won't.

268
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,590
Ari, I'll happily spend
50 million over the next ten years

269
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,349
to make sure that you
don't even get a dime today.

270
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,877
Call everyone on that list.
Emergency Hamlet session, now!

271
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,195
Ari, Vince and E called twice.

272
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,800
- They do not seem happy.
- I will call them back.

273
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,991
Did you not fucking hear me?
This is an emergency!

274
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,079
- Well, who's going to man the phones?
- Fuck the phones, Lloyd!

275
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,999
Unless Carmen Electra calls
for an emergency titty fuck, don't answer!

276
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,233
82% excellent. That's pretty good.

277
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,078
It's more than that.
That's Greek Wedding good.

278
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,033
What these test scores tell us
is that black-and-white is depressing.

279
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,399
People want colour.

280
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,749
Why have those eyes
if people can't see 'em?

281
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,074
They might as well be brown.

282
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,918
I didn't make this movie
to show off my eye colouring.

283
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,633
Vince, you not only
look great in the movie,

284
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,114
you are... great in the movie.

285
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,436
And with this version
we will attract a much broader audience.

286
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,789
Isn't that what making movies is about?

287
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,956
Well, actually, it's an art film.

288
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,991
You know it's good if people hate it.

289
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,592
I'm sorry, but we are not in the business
of having people hate our movies.

290
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,108
Guys, I love your passion,

291
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,436
but trust me, there's nothing unartistic
about making money.

292
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,071
You're driving like a snail.

293
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,669
- I could run faster than this.
- All right, we're here. Go get 'em.

294
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,870
- I'm 20 minutes late.
- So run!

295
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,315
All right! Great news.

296
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,194
The Gold Standard Agency
is starting its expansion ahead of schedule.

297
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,358
Instead of September 1st,
we are going to be starting today.

298
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,233
- Yeah!
- All right!

299
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,556
Slight problem, though.
You won't get paid for six months.

300
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,999
What?

301
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,510
The first year at Google
they paid their staff with paper clips.

302
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,711
Now the guy that scrubbed the toilets
has got a billion five.

303
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,320
Who's with me?
Come on, anybody?

304
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,272
- I'm with you, Ari.
- Like you've got a fucking choice.

305
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,834
- Anybody else?
- This is bullshit, Ari.

306
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,677
- You cannot be serious.
- You told us...

307
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,631
We had papers put in front of us today.

308
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,399
- Come on, everybody.
- I have a choice.

309
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,798
A little bit of patience,
you guys, please.

310
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,319
Come on, you gotta...

311
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,595
Babs, the Traitorous Skanks
Anonymous meeting's next door.

312
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,838
Let's talk.

313
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,554
I can't believe you set me up
after all I've done.

314
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,953
I needed to see your cards.

315
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,878
- You've seen 'em.
- How much do you need?

316
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,960
- What?
- Come on, I want to be partners.

317
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,672
- Why?
- I believe in you.

318
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,836
And I can't work with my ex-husband.

319
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,074
This is my deal.

320
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,998
Ari, you have no money
and I have too much.

321
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,315
- So what do you want?
- To fuck.

322
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,949
Kidding.

323
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,991
I want 60% and my name on top.

324
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,917
- I'd rather fuck.
- 55.

325
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,518
- 45.
- 51.

326
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,391
49.

327
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,595
Ladies and gentlemen...

328
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,392
I present to you,

329
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,509
Miller Gold!

330
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,039
We sound like a fuckin' beer.

331
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,316
This was the one, Turtle.

332
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,839
I'm officially a loser.

333
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,871
I don't know about "officially".

334
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,070
What do you want me to say?
You gotta get the temper under control.

335
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,233
- You gotta know that.
- I do.

336
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,158
I was thinking about
taking that anger management thing

337
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,873
- the judge recommended last year.
- You should.

338
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,752
- Hello?
- Johnny Drama, Eddie Burns.

339
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,438
- Eddie?
- Yeah, look.

340
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,393
I've been trying to get your number but
nobody's picking up the phone at your agency.

341
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,989
- Really?
- I'm sorry I had to bail on you today.

342
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,191
I got an emergency
and I'm off to New York.

343
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,073
- So you weren't at your office?
- No.

344
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,714
Christ, I was standing
out there for like an hour.

345
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,389
I'm sorry, but I want to talk to you
about this thing I'm shooting.

346
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,829
Look, Eddie, I know I can do this.

347
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,632
I know you can do it too, Drama.

348
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,557
I just wanted to see you today

349
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,750
to make sure you hadn't aged too badly.

350
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,438
Aged? Me? Come on!

351
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,233
I got carded at Barney's Beanery
Thursday night.

352
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,919
OK, Drama. So you'll do this?

353
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,952
Are you offering this to me?
I don't have to audition?

354
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,878
You did something for me
when you passed on Brothers McMullen.

355
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,115
- I didn't pass.
- Drama, come on.

356
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,799
You passed to do a little arc
on 90210, it's cool.

357
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,674
I ended up having to put myself in the movie,
changed my whole life.

358
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,597
- Awesome.
- So I'll see you on set.

359
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,631
OK, thanks.

360
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,870
I just got a pilot.

361
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,438
Victory!

362
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,232
And anger management?

363
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,077
Fuck anger management.

364
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,874
After seeing a cut of the film,
we fell in love with it.

365
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,434
From the moment
the end credits rolled,

366
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,835
it was obvious to me...

367
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,996
- Did you get it, Johnny?
- Yep.

368
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,109
- It's easier than I thought.
- Congratulations.

369
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,479
Thanks, bro.

370
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,990
- There you are, Vincent.
- Jesus, I thought you abandoned me.

371
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,234
I came as fast as I could.

372
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,431
- They're about to introduce you.
- Right. Look, I love you.

373
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,630
Don't worry, I think I got this handled.

374
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,035
- You cool with this?
- Do what you gotta do.

375
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,229
What's he gotta do?

376
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,840
- You'll see.
- Oh, great.

377
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,394
...a great young talent
like Vincent Chase.

378
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,159
These motherfuckin' pieces of shit.

379
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,079
I'm gonna fuckin' hit somebody,
there's no fuckin' doubt in my mind.

380
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,715
- Go lightly, Billy. Life is short.
- Go fuck your mother, Drama.

381
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,519
- Where you been?
- What, is there a problem?

382
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,915
The house is packed,
our boy is looking great.

383
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,837
You know Barbara, right?

384
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,396
Each camera represents
a million dollars overseas.

385
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,432
- I don't think so, Ari.
- Oh, yeah? Why not?

386
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,755
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Speak.

387
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,110
...to introduce to you now
the star of Queens Boulevard,

388
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,230
Mr Vincent Chase.

389
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,113
Thank you.

390
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,594
Queens Boulevard is a masterpiece.

391
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,712
And I'm not just saying that
because I'm in it or to sell you.

392
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,513
I'm saying it because
I really truly believe it.

393
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,757
Unfortunately, you'll never see
the film I'm talking about,

394
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,713
because these people up here,
these execs, ripped out its soul.

395
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,754
Because like all studios in this town
they don't give a shit about art.

396
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,076
They only care
about one thing - money.

397
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,951
Fuck commerce!

398
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,399
Any questions? Yes.

399
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,238
Great start to the new company.

400
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,189
