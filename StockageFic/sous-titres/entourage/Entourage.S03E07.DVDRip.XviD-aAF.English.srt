1
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,469
So let me get this straight.

2
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,114
You wake up snuggling
a girl that you didn't even fuck?

3
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,276
I'm not repeating myself again.

4
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,914
- It's disgusting.
- What is disgusting about that?

5
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,714
What's disgusting is the only reason
a guy should snuggle a girl

6
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,751
is if he's allowed to fuck her first.

7
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,394
Or at least if she promises
she'll fuck him later.

8
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,955
- Who snuggles in a threesome anyway?
- Who uses the word snuggle?

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,913
- E and E.
- Men spoon, E. Women snuggle.

10
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,473
I'm glad you're in on this too.

11
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,910
What? It was funny.
Besides, I got fired. I need a good laugh.

12
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,317
Laugh in the car. I promised Sloan I'd look
at her setup for tonight. I want you to come.

13
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,636
We're going to her event tonight.
Why are we going this morning?

14
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,356
Cos it'll be awkward. If you're there I can say
we're going to lunch, or I might get stuck.

15
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,269
OK, fine, E. If you need us to go, we'll go.
OK? Right, guys?

16
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,915
- Yeah, of course.
- All right, we'll go, we'll go.

17
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,159
But what you really need, E,
is a good snuggle. Get over here!

18
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,632
Just checking in.
Wanted to see how our boy is doing.

19
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,477
He wants to know how you're doing.

20
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,752
Besides the fact that the LA Times compared
me to Terrell Owens, I'm doing great.

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,153
You hear that, Ari?

22
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,839
The Eagles got rid of TO
and look where they landed.

23
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,317
Aquaman 2 is gonna make Speed 2
look like Citizen fucking Kane.

24
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,715
All right, you tell Vince
we will bounce back.

25
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,832
You tell him yourself
at Sloan's event tonight, right?

26
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,270
Come on, Ari. It's for a good cause.
It would mean a lot to me.

27
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,595
I get hard thinking that you actually like me.

28
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,269
However, I'll be with your father-in-law
for the first time in months.

29
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,754
If all goes well,
I promise you

30
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,270
that I will try to show up if you
promise me not to wear any panties.

31
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,311
- Bye, Ari.
- Bye, Eric.

32
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,108
I hoped you sharpened your fangs, Bar,
because it is go time.

33
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,479
Hold that!

34
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,794
- Terence.
- Ari.

35
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,354
You look a little haggard.
Everything all right?

36
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,712
It's called ageing. Not everyone stays young
by sucking the blood of their employees.

37
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,877
Gentlemen, let's keep this civil. I suggest...

38
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,275
Ari, you and I are both born negotiators.

39
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,914
So let's keep the legal eagles
out of this, shall we?

40
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,712
- Absolutely.
- Good.

41
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,231
Now, in the interest of putting this
whole sordid mess behind us,

42
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,191
you'll find this offer very generous.

43
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,795
We've been here before.
You know what? Save a tree. Say it out loud.

44
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,272
I'm prepared to offer you $4 million.

45
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,878
Four?

46
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,156
OK, first let me counter by saying fuck you.

47
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,716
You see, while you were off
on your eight-year sabbatical,

48
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,797
sailing, duck-hunting,
whatever the fuck it is you do,

49
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,756
I took that agency from the mid-level shithole
it was to the powerhouse it currently is

50
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,712
- and I can prove it.
- And I thought I had an ego.

51
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,389
You want to go to court? Let's.
I got nothing but time.

52
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,991
Or have you forgot I got a very rich wife who
loves to spoil me. Let's get the fuck out of here.

53
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,955
Wait.

54
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,673
10 million.

55
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,314
- 12 million.
- Fine.

56
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,669
- 11 it is.
- You got yourself a deal.

57
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,795
Thank fucking God!

58
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,876
Yeah!

59
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,956
Way to earn your commission in there, Bar.

60
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,150
- So what's your opening line?
- Fuck off.

61
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,954
- They won't like that.
- Say hello to Sloan first, everything will be fine.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,639
- Thanks for that tip.
- If you don't want us here...

63
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,591
Just get in here.

64
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,878
Hi, baby, how are you?

65
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,315
- Hello.
- Hello.

66
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,677
- Hi, guys.
- What's up?

67
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,197
- The place looks amazing.
- Thank you.

68
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,037
You guys work well together.

69
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,953
It's great what you're doing. I just want to say
if there's anything I can do to help, I'll do it.

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,752
Really? Anything?

71
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,836
- Anything.
- That is great.

72
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,078
We're supposed to auction off a dinner date
with Zach Braff, but he just bailed.

73
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,473
Anything else?

74
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,671
- No, that's it.
- Whatever you need.

75
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,119
Thank you so much.

76
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,357
The flower guys.
Hold on one second. Hello?

77
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,116
I'm gonna go back to the hotel
and work on my tan, so see you later.

78
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,354
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

79
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,753
- Peace.
- Goodbye, Eric.

80
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,631
Later.

81
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,149
You thought
you wanted to get in and out fast.

82
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,792
- She was cold, right?
- Cold?

83
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,229
She ran from you like a chicken
with a cough.

84
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,953
- What does that mean?
- It's an avian flu reference.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,638
Good one.

86
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,432
This is not good.

87
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,675
I don't know what you're obsessing about.

88
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,119
She thinks I'm a freak.

89
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,118
You hit her with the unsolicited snuggle,
you are a freak.

90
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,311
Take me home. I'm gonna
drive over to her hotel and apologise.

91
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,238
What? Apologise? For snuggling her?

92
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,236
For invading her space.
I don't know.

93
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,589
You're a sensitive guy, E.

94
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,200
- It's kinda queer.
- Whatever.

95
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,153
You know what, Drama? He is sensitive.
Maybe we should all go with him.

96
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,236
Thanks. I don't need support on this.

97
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,909
Wasn't going for support.
Was going to see Tori's ass in a bathing suit.

98
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,317
The girls from Wisteria Lane.

99
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,113
Which one is hiding a large
black man in your basement?

100
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,718
What are you doing here?

101
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,470
I came to tell you that our marriage is a sham
and the last 15 years have meant nothing.

102
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,988
- What are you talking about?
- I came to tell you

103
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,918
that I want it to actually
mean something this time.

104
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,359
Oh, my God!

105
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,512
- Let me put it on you.
- Oh, my God.

106
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,757
- Whip 'em out. Who's got the biggest?
- The meeting went well?

107
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,873
It went well, baby. Let me show you how well.
I'm stealing the bride-to-be.

108
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,911
- Where are we going?
- It's a secret.

109
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,111
Lunch is on me
provided Joyce has her stomach stapled.

110
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,869
Fuck you, Ari. Just for that I'm
ordering a bottle of Cristal.

111
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,069
The new Gold Standard.

112
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,874
It'll make the Endeavor building
look like a fucking Dunkin' Donuts.

113
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,592
Oh, my God, it is huge.

114
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,517
It'll house 150 agents.

115
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,554
All of whom, if they're sexually harassed,
have only one person to sue. Me.

116
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,194
Ari, can we afford this?

117
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,109
We've been planning this for nine months.
With this money all the pieces are in place.

118
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,118
I know you're scared. But it's time.

119
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,798
Just say yes.

120
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,350
Let's go take a lap in the executive Jacuzzi.

121
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,755
- A Jacuzzi?
- They're putting one in.

122
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,153
- No.
- We could talk about it.

123
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,236
- We just did.
- Maybe I can bribe you.

124
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,919
Here? Ari, are you out of your mind?

125
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,230
- Eric. Yo, what's up, E?
- Seth. What's going on?

126
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,157
- How are you?
- I'm good, I'm good.

127
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,590
How's Vince? I can't believe they fired him.
Brutal.

128
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,995
It's for the best. Frees us to do other projects

129
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,110
- we're more interested in.
- Good.

130
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,072
- Sorry about your show getting cancelled.
- What are you gonna do?

131
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,317
Nobody believed four guys in their 30s
would live together.

132
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,715
I lived at the guest house until last year.

133
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,799
You get moved up
to the maid's quarters now? I'm kidding.

134
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,149
- How's Sloan?
- She's good. You know Sloan?

135
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,111
I know Sloan. She's a great girl, man.

136
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,991
- Yeah.
- You guys doing all right?

137
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,918
- Yeah, good. I'll tell her you said hi.
- You should.

138
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,597
Oh, excuse me.

139
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,518
- It's not what it looks like, Seth.
- It never is, man.

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,070
Can we get a drink?

141
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,673
Yeah, sure.

142
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,274
Look, I just wanted to come by and apologise.

143
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,356
- For what?
- For the other day.

144
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,233
- You know, the way we woke up.
- You mean the way I woke up?

145
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,398
- It was completely unintentional.
- Obviously. I mean, you were sleeping.

146
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,831
Exactly. I was as surprised as you were.
But I'd just prefer if we didn't tell Sloan.

147
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,395
She might think it was weird.
I mean, it was a little weird, right?

148
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,194
Well, I mean, actually waking up
with you spooning me was kind of funny

149
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,949
but I think Sloan would think it was
a lot weirder that you're here now.

150
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,315
The only reason I came here was to apologise.

151
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,998
I hope so.

152
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,473
Why else would I be here?

153
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,638
I have no idea. I hardly know you.
But let me tell you something about me.

154
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,638
- The other night was fun and nothing more.
- I know.

155
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,752
And Sloan is a good friend of mine
and she's your girlfriend

156
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,952
so you just being here behind her back
is making me totally uncomfortable.

157
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,559
Sorry. Fine.

158
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,559
- I can't believe we just did that.
- It was like freshman year at the ZBT house.

159
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,989
We didn't do it freshman year
at the ZBT house.

160
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,429
You're right. That was Amy Myers.

161
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,278
- You fucked Amy Myers?
- You're gonna get mad about it?

162
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,550
It was 20 years ago. You landed the big prize.

163
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,034
- I did.
- I love you. Come here.

164
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,599
God, Ari! What the hell?

165
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,312
- That was Adam Davies.
- Who?

166
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,920
That rat-fuck
that screwed me with Terence.

167
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,918
- So what?
- So? Is that rock fucking blinding you?

168
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,158
If he knows that I'm taking the big space,
he'll know I'm starting the big agency.

169
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,350
So what's the difference if he knows?

170
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,073
- We don't have the money.
- We have an agreement.

171
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,473
He didn't see anything.

172
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,317
- Get me up.
- Don't worry about it.

173
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,918
What the fuck was that?

174
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,430
My wife lost a contact, Davies.
Why don't you pop out and help us?

175
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,631
I'll give you a curbing
when you're on your knees.

176
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,557
You'd love to see me
with something hard in my mouth.

177
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,511
- Jesus.
- Sorry.

178
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,916
He brings it out in me. Later.

179
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,797
What, baby? It's all good.
He doesn't suspect a thing. Come on.

180
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,070
She basically called me a stalker.

181
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,918
From snuggler to stalker.
Sounds like an MOW.

182
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,158
Girls have a tendency to throw that term
around, E. I wouldn't sweat it.

183
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,751
- The only reason I went was to apologise.
- Which I didn't understand in the first place.

184
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,839
Let's for a moment just assume
we understand the reason for the apology.

185
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,758
- Why to her?
- Yeah, E, why to her?

186
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,075
- Yeah, why her?
- What do you mean?

187
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,111
You should be apologising to Sloan.

188
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,993
After all, she was the one
you weren't snuggling with.

189
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,318
- Maybe there's a reason you went there.
- Maybe there's a reason behind the snuggle.

190
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,237
Oh, no.

191
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,634
Did E fall in love during a threesome?

192
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,557
If anyone could do it, it's E.

193
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,956
You're like a chick. I mean,
the guy cannot have unemotional sex.

194
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,231
- I didn't have sex.
- You can't whack off without weeping.

195
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,354
I went down there for no other reason
than to say sorry and apologise for cuddling

196
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,277
or spooning or whatever, Drama.

197
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,231
It was unintentional, an accident.

198
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,953
Freud says there are no accidents.

199
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,952
You guys crossed swords
during your threesome. Accident?

200
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,831
Yo yo, Eric Murphy.

201
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,110
- Come on, we're gonna be late.
- I'm coming.

202
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,754
I can't believe I'm the one telling you that.

203
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,116
- Never mind.
- Come on, what's up?

204
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,516
I can't stop thinking about Tori.
It makes me sick. I feel guilty.

205
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,154
Jesus. Really?

206
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,838
You're really into her?

207
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,510
No, it's just that when we were doing
our whole, you know, thing,

208
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,039
I wanted her. Bad.

209
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,917
- So?
- More than I wanted Sloan.

210
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,830
You had a threesome. Any guy's gonna
want what he's never had during that.

211
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,519
- I still want her.
- You were this close to having her.

212
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,199
It was a big tease.
If you'd had it it'd be over now.

213
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,992
- You think?
- Absolutely.

214
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,077
And here's the good news.
She's not into you.

215
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,990
She thinks you're a stalker.

216
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,953
She was probably wanting a threesome
to get to Sloan.

217
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,073
And she lives 3,000 miles away,
so just get through the night and it's over.

218
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,599
It should be a good one.

219
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,995
I'm the one who's being sold like I'm on eBay.

220
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,789
It could be fun. Like that time you got
auctioned off for Feed the World.

221
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,798
Remember that Cuban guy who wanted me
to live with him in Havana?

222
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,956
Never sent me those cigars. I should call.

223
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,753
Ask if he knows any good lefties
for the Yanks bullpen.

224
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,157
- Great mother of God.
- She cleans up good, huh?

225
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,112
Just get through the night.

226
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,038
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

227
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,878
Thank you so much for coming. Hi.

228
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,115
- Things are going well.
- They are.

229
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,358
They're about to get better. Vince?
Let's show the ladies what they're bidding on.

230
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,996
- I thought it was a silent auction.
- It is. But I've got to present the merchandise.

231
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,513
Let's go get a drink.

232
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,519
Where do you want to go?
French Riviera, St Barths, Australian outback?

233
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,916
No more spending, Ari.
Not until we're in the clear.

234
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,397
We are. I don't know why I panicked.
Davies saw us in the middle of the street.

235
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,479
What does that mean to him?
Absolutely nothing. Pick a vacation destination.

236
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,954
No more spending, Ari.

237
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,595
It's charity. Come on, it's a tax write-off.

238
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,835
You know what?
I'm gonna bid on all of them.

239
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,674
- How are you, mate?
- Cheers, Ari.

240
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,553
Prick.

241
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,596
All I'm saying is me and a girl like Tori
are wild kindred free spirits.

242
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,791
I'd never want to go where you've been, E,

243
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,594
but since you never actually got there,
you mind if I try it on for size?

244
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,235
- You tried the other night. No luck.
- I'm with E. You got no shot, Drama.

245
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,113
I'm not gonna debate
whether or not I can get the girl.

246
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,310
I'm only asking if E would care.

247
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,749
- I have a girlfriend.
- Say you don't care.

248
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,555
- You can't say it.
- I don't care.

249
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,751
- Sweet.
- Yeah, well, here she comes.

250
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,234
- She looks angry.
- Good, I like 'em mean.

251
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,669
Makes taming them
a greater challenge.

252
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,948
Just relax.

253
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,515
Hi there.

254
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,109
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.

255
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,274
And now our featured item
of the evening.

256
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,949
A lovely night of dinner and dancing
under the stars...

257
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,797
- Dancing?
- One dance.

258
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,196
The dashing Vincent Chase, everybody.

259
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,840
Here he comes. Vincent.

260
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,950
Vincent Chase, ladies and gentlemen.

261
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,953
Come on, ladies, there he is,

262
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,639
as handsome off screen
as he is on screen...

263
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,956
Look, I'm sorry
if I came off as harsh earlier.

264
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,639
I shouldn't have come to your hotel.

265
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,958
Well, I was kind of cold and I probably made
you feel like something was wrong

266
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,195
but I know that you're a good guy, Eric.

267
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,438
I knew that... even before you
so lovingly embraced me.

268
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,278
Jesus. I haven't done a lot of these. You?

269
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,639
A few more than you. But not a lot.

270
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,319
So how were we?

271
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,876
Well, I don't know about you...

272
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,593
- Well, Sloan and her rules.
- Yeah.

273
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,632
We'll get her to drop those rules tonight
and I'll make a later flight. We'll try again.

274
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,115
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

275
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,072
Ladies, this is your chance
to spend the evening with a real live superhero.

276
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,475
So put your bid in now or lose out.

277
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,869
- You owe me big time.
- I know I do.

278
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,478
Can I sample the goods?

279
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,715
I'm selling stock to get you.

280
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,069
If I pay more, can I keep
you for the weekend?

281
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,429
We'll discuss it with your husband.

282
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,470
- You seem like a hot ticket.
- I feel like an iPod.

283
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,080
- Will you buy me?
- I don't think I can afford you.

284
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,473
I could loan you the money.

285
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,759
It's exquisite. It's so unlike you.

286
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,268
- Well...
- I must compliment Ari.

287
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:28,236
- God, this must have cost a fortune.
- Well, actually, it's just a CZ.

288
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,194
- Don't tell anyone.
- No. Never.

289
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,478
- What?
- I had to tell that bitch this was a fake.

290
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,072
You didn't have to do that.

291
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,829
- I thought we were keeping the money secret.
- Terence knows we have money.

292
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,075
- He gave it to me.
- How the fuck was I to know?

293
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,998
You have me so confused.
I don't like secrets.

294
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,952
Office space.
You just can't say office space.

295
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,513
I thought about tattoos a couple times,
but I could never decide on one.

296
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,120
Me either. That's why I have four.

297
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,277
Really? I thought I spotted one.

298
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,754
The rest are hiding.

299
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,469
Will you excuse me for one second?
I will be right back, I promise.

300
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,195
- You're spinning like a top.
- I've got to get out.

301
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,231
- Why?
- I can't be around this girl.

302
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,998
E, come on, we went over this.

303
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,032
She wants another go-around.
This time no rules.

304
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,311
- Wow, that's nice.
- It's not. I don't want another go-around.

305
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,952
Not with Sloan there, you mean.

306
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,639
I don't know what it is.
I got something crazy for her.

307
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,830
I told you what it is.

308
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,189
I want to grab her, take her in the coatroom.

309
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,470
Come on.
You're not a coatroom kind of guy.

310
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,398
I'm not a threesome guy either.
That's the problem.

311
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,911
- Just relax.
- I cannot be around Sloan and her together.

312
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,791
She'll see it all over my face, you know?

313
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,673
Yeah, I do. You're a good Catholic boy.

314
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,234
It's cute. So avoid temptation. Go home.

315
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,271
I'll tell them you're sick.

316
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,758
Coatroom.

317
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,354
Eric. Where are you going?

318
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,994
I was just going outside.
I'm not feeling that well.

319
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,032
- Oh, no.
- I'm just feeling a little nauseous.

320
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,868
- I'm sorry, baby.
- I think I might need to go home.

321
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,478
Yeah, of course.
Go to my place.

322
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,798
I'll just finish up here and wait for Tori's car
to arrive, then I'll take care of you, OK?

323
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,308
- OK.
- I love you.

324
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,793
I love you too.

325
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,518
- See you.
- Feel better.

326
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,790
Ladies and gentlemen. It's time to announce
the winners of tonight's silent auction.

327
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,798
The winner of the Dodgers box seats,

328
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,751
Peter Vapnick.

329
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,711
Figures. The only thing I wanted.

330
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,955
- You don't deserve it!
- Congratulations.

331
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,355
I have something better you can bid on.

332
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,436
What, are you selling your ass again?

333
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,038
No, my client list.

334
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,390
I know you're taking space.
I want in.

335
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,437
You're crazy.

336
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,269
I'd think that too if I didn't see you
dive under that car to avoid me today.

337
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,470
But I did. It made me curious.

338
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,159
So much so that I pulled a U-ey
and went snooping.

339
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,395
And guess what I found.

340
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,433
Office space that says unless your
wife's baby blanket biz went big time,

341
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,278
you are about to open
the largest agency in town.

342
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,193
I want partnership, corner office,
and $1 million guaranteed salary.

343
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,829
A, you wouldn't get that even
if I did like you, Davies.

344
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,758
And B, even if I were taking space,
which I am not,

345
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,189
you fucked me last year.

346
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,356
Do you think we can work together?

347
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,914
Come on, Ari. We're all animals.

348
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,428
We just go wherever there's the most food.

349
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,074
My fridge is bare, pal.

350
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,475
OK, should we see what Terence thinks?

351
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,080
Winner of St Barths for $12,800

352
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,111
is Ari Gold.

353
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,752
Next up, a week of sun and fun
on the French Riviera.

354
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,155
And the winner is Ari Gold.

355
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,359
Really spending that money, eh, Ari?

356
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,674
What else did you buy?

357
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,554
- Nice suit, Davies.
- Thank you, Terence.

358
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,033
A date with a movie star,

359
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,799
the gorgeous Vincent Chase...

360
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,435
Molly Burns. Molly Burns.

361
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,074
Here she is. Let her hear it.

362
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,112
Come on up, Molly.
Vince, ladies and gentlemen.

363
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,039
- Where the fuck is he?
- Where is he?

364
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,638
Vincent Chase to the podium.

365
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,471
Hiding is my guess.

366
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,956
Vincent Chase, please.
Vincent Chase to the podium.

367
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,673
- I wonder what you sold for.
- I wonder who I sold to.

368
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,553
He's here somewhere.
We're gonna find him.

369
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,352
Wait!

370
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,672
Hey, baby.

371
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,631
How are you feeling?

372
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,875
Good. Who's here?

373
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,912
Tori. She missed her flight.
She's gonna crash on the couch.

374
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,712
Her car is coming at 5:30.

375
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,118
- I'm gonna get ready for bed. Go to sleep.
- OK.

376
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,558
Oh, you're still here?

377
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,272
Sorry. Did I wake you?

378
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,788
No, just going to get
a drink cos I'm thirsty.

379
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,834
- Listen, it was nice to meet you.
- You too.

380
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,671
- What are you thinking, Eric?
- I don't know.

381
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,757
Want to jump on the couch
while Sloan's in the other room?

382
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,873
No.

383
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,594
- Go back to bed.
- I can't sleep.

384
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,631
Take an Ambien.

385
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,679
Listen, am I crazy,
or do we both want this?

386
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,239
Does it matter?

387
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,630
You got a great girl in there, Eric.
She almost let you have this.

388
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,435
Don't fuck it up.

389
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,151
- Bye.
- Bye.

390
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,749
English
