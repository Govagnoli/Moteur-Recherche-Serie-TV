1
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:33,824
It may not look like much now
but wait till you see Poseidonis in 3D.

2
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,590
- With Aquaman riding Storm.
- What's Storm?

3
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,927
That's his animatronic seahorse.

4
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,832
Amazing. Eventually you won't
even need actors, right?

5
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,995
In five years we won't.

6
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,828
Kidding.

7
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,807
You still mad at me
for bailing on dinner?

8
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,707
I'm not mad at you.

9
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:53,075
- So what's wrong?
- Who says there's anything wrong?

10
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,047
I know you.
I can tell.

11
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,982
Vince, you haven't known me
in like five years.

12
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:01,111
True. You've probably changed a lot.
I've changed a lot. I learned French.

13
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,850
I didn't know these two
had a history.

14
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,619
It's nothing.

15
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:08,183
Even if something was wrong,
I think it's egotistical

16
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,492
that you just assume
it's about you.

17
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,521
That's right.
I mean, you're right.

18
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:15,295
But I'm right too. There is
something wrong. So what is it?

19
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,462
Nothing.

20
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,301
I don't want to talk
about it with you.

21
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,775
We're gonna be up here for a while,
we might as well talk about something.

22
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,642
I had a fight with Chris.

23
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,839
I don't want to talk
about that.

24
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:31,373
Vince, how are we ever going
to make this movie together?

25
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,282
They're gonna make
this movie together

26
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,220
because between them
they're making $8 million.

27
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,952
Fucking actors, they never know
when they're miked,

28
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,859
It was weird,
on "True Lies"

29
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:45,661
it was Tom Arnold that said
he was gonna be governor.

30
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,689
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. Cameron,

31
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,224
- Yeah?
- Ron's on the phone.

32
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:52,397
There seems to be a small
problem with the hovercraft.

33
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,303
What is it?

34
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,865
- It won't hover.
- God damn it.

35
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,639
Gary?

36
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,476
I hope these two are not
going to be a fucking problem, Eric.

37
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,209
Go ahead, Jim.

38
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,649
Gary, I need you
at the hovercraft right now, over.

39
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,414
Flying in.

40
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,891
What happened with you
and Chris? I want to know.

41
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:15,326
- We're having communication issues.
- We had those.

42
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,454
- You got to be more upfront.
- Oh really?

43
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,793
If we're talking about
someone who's never been upfront,

44
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:24,064
we should be talking
about you.

45
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,231
- What?
- Well I'm going to be upfront now.

46
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,673
I'm not over you.

47
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,840
And I haven't gotten over you.

48
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,641
How's that for upfront?

49
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,746
We are so fucked.

50
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:46,190
So first you tell me your relationship
with this girl was meaningless.

51
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,194
Then I find out
that you proposed to her.

52
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,822
Then you tell me you haven't
thought about her in five years

53
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,956
when, as sick as it is,
you're still in love with her.

54
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,762
How can I trust anything
you say anymore?

55
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,395
How can I trust you?
You're the one eavesdropping.

56
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,905
Should have Gavin de Becker
come sweep the house for bugs.

57
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,702
You know what?
This is a bad situation.

58
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,834
You know what, E?
There's is no situation.

59
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,970
Mandy is engaged. You're acting
like an obsessed schoolgirl.

60
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,914
E, do me a favor. Manage my career,
not my relationships.

61
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,883
This is your career.
And mine too, all right?

62
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,943
In front of James Cameron,
stop lying to me.

63
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:17,013
I don't want to talk about
this in front of the guys. I'm serious.

64
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,752
Vince, Armani doesn't have
a suit for under two grand.

65
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,350
Don't worry,
it's all on me.

66
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,055
Seriously, do we
need to wear suits?

67
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,690
What else are you going to wear
to a bat mitzvah? A Knick jersey?

68
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,393
It's formal.
I was thinking home whites.

69
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,401
How come you're not
trying anything on?

70
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,494
I don't let other men
buy my clothes, Drama.

71
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,698
And I'm not paying two grand
for a suit myself.

72
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,867
Wear the suit you wore
for your high school graduation.

73
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,535
It's hanging in your closet.

74
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,374
I thought that was
his communion suit.

75
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,210
E didn't grow much from communion
to high school graduation.

76
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,715
It's probably the same suit.

77
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,308
Fuck you guys.
I'm going to Men's Warehouse.

78
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,252
Oh come on, E.
I think you can afford a nice suit.

79
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,882
Yeah, E.
Don't be such a chaza huh.

80
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,948
I'm brushing up on
my Hebrew for the affair.

81
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,983
Chaza means greedy,
Drama, not cheap.

82
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,758
- How do you know?
- E used to valet park at Ohav Shalom.

83
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,857
That's great, Drama.
Now you're illiterate in two languages.

84
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,925
Let's hit shoes.

85
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,733
Men's Warehouse?

86
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,240
Don't start.

87
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,242
What do you think,
red or blue?

88
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,507
The red's a little flashy for
a bat mitzvah, Vince. I like the blue.

89
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:16,947
Okay. How did you know we were
going to a bat mitzvah?

90
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,883
- You don't remember me?
- Sloan.

91
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,886
- Sloan McQuewick, right?
- That's right.

92
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,820
Good memory.
Eric, right?

93
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,447
Yeah, good memory too.

94
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,981
This is Terrance's daughter.
Terrance is Ari's boss.

95
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:30,462
- Ari's partner.
- That's right. Now I remember.

96
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,192
- Do you?
- No, not really.

97
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,893
I'm sorry,
how did we meet?

98
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,801
The Christmas party, last year.
You were going to Italy, right?

99
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,397
That's right. You were
thinking about getting engaged,

100
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,408
- What?
- We had a couple drinks.

101
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,467
More than a couple,
I think.

102
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,034
I take it
you didn't then.

103
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,808
Oh no.
We broke up.

104
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,275
So, will I be seeing
you both at Ari's party?

105
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,879
- Yeah.
- Great. We'll have fun.

106
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,049
- See ya.
- Nice to meet you again.

107
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,252
Well, Vince, what else
can we do for you today?

108
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,523
I'm just going to look at
some more ties and that's it.

109
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,790
Great.

110
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,765
Know what, Philip? I think
I'm going to buy myself a new suit.

111
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,359
What?
She's not engaged.

112
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,339
Don't even think about
not picking that up, Ray,

113
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,206
- 'cause I'll fucking kill you.
- Fuck you, Ari.

114
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,123
Fabulous, baby.
Fabulous.

115
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,427
Hey, Is it me

116
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:39,931
- or is her voice getting worse?
- Ari!

117
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,799
Doesn't mean that I don't love her,
but she's just awful, baby.

118
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,894
Hey kids.
Whose car's out front?

119
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,905
Terrance.
He's waiting for you out back.

120
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,271
Terrance is here?
Why's he here?

121
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,799
I don't know.
Why don't you find out?

122
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,869
Ari, what are you
freaking out about?

123
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,882
Guy lives three blocks from us
and hasn't been by in five years.

124
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,374
Now he shows up four hours before we're
supposed to see him. Something's up.

125
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,217
- Ari.
- What?

126
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,985
You're a partner now. You don't need
to be afraid of him anymore.

127
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,754
I'm afraid of him? I'll beat that
old fuck and throw him in the pool.

128
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,262
Only Daddy speaks that way.

129
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,825
Out.

130
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,631
- There he is.
- Ari!

131
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,401
Terrance,
what a pleasant surprise.

132
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,466
- Nice to see you, mate.
- Nice to see you.

133
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,238
- Sweaty.
- Ha ha.

134
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,405
Well, I'm looking forward
to this evening.

135
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,312
Yeah, well it should
be fun, huh?

136
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,873
Cost me enough,
it better be.

137
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,977
I hope you're not going
to try and expense

138
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,954
any of this bat mitzvah
to the agency.

139
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,478
Me?

140
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:42,187
Ah, so little Sarah
becomes a woman tonight.

141
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,059
Yeah.

142
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,893
Time flies.
Incredible, isn't it?

143
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,559
It seems like
only yesterday

144
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,228
that my Sloan was running around
in pigtails and braces.

145
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,634
- Amazing.
- Yeah yeah.

146
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,366
You know,
speaking of Sloan,

147
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:57,342
she mentioned that she ran into
Vincent Chase in Beverly Hills.

148
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,038
You know, she can't stop
raving about this guy.

149
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,742
She thinks he's gonna be
a giant movie star.

150
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,648
I've been saying
that for five years.

151
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,676
Yes, but Sloan
is never wrong.

152
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,585
You know, she saw
Johnny Depp

153
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,749
in "Platoon" when she
was eight years old

154
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,624
and she said, "Dad,
that's the guy to watch."

155
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,924
You showed her "Platoon"
when she was eight years old?

156
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,989
- Oliver did. He wanted feedback.
- Ha ha ha.

157
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,330
Listen, the reason
for my visit is

158
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,303
I'd like a little chat
with Mr. Chase tonight.

159
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,965
I'd like to see
into his head,

160
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,169
find out what his hopes
and his dreams are.

161
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,110
We've had that talk
dozens of times,

162
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,079
and I could tell you firsthand...

163
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:38,345
No, firsthand
would be him telling me.

164
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,079
Yeah.

165
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:43,611
So listen,
why don't you give me

166
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,749
a proper introduction
tonight, huh?

167
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,818
- I mean, make an old man happy.
- Yeah.

168
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,524
Oh, listen...

169
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,267
- this is for the little lady.
- Oh.

170
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,466
I didn't want my gift to get
mixed up with all the others.

171
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:03,339
Huh?

172
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,610
Would you stop?

173
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,278
- You're gonna spoil your appetite.
- You're not my mother.

174
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,014
If I'm not eating,
you're not eating.

175
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,419
I'm fucking starving!

176
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,446
Do you know how much food
is gonna be at this thing?

177
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,322
You eating right now
would be like jerking off

178
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,883
an hour before
fucking a supermodel.

179
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,226
If I was fucking a supermodel,
I would jerk off.

180
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,992
That way I can
go all night.

181
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,523
- You guys ready for a big night?
- You sure Ari wants us there?

182
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,036
Of course he does, Turtle.
Ari looks at us as family.

183
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,766
Then why doesn't
he represent me?

184
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:37,242
Oh hey!
Look at this guy!

185
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,575
$3,000 suit just to line up
some pussy, huh, E?

186
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:44,344
It's a good investment. McQuewick's
gotta be worth 100 million easy.

187
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:48,114
You buying that suit is like
buying Microsoft in the '80s.

188
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,985
That's if you can
get the girl.

189
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,718
- I just needed a new suit, that's all.
- Oh yeah?

190
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,623
- What about the hair?
- What about it?

191
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,629
- A little shiny.
- Mangoes.

192
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,460
- Don't smell me.
- Uh-oh.

193
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,557
Looks like we're headed
for another E romance novel.

194
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,228
Get your tissues ready, guys.

195
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,203
Seriously, if this one
breaks your heart,

196
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,432
just kill yourself
so we don't have to hear about it.

197
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:08,838
I'll have the Barry Manilow
CD ready for you.

198
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,707
- Fuck you guys.
- What are you so sensitive about?

199
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,678
We know you well enough
to know you're in for trouble.

200
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,477
Yeah? How well
do we know you, Vince?

201
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,244
What does that mean?

202
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,979
Yeah, why are you
going off on Vince for?

203
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,987
No reason.

204
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,649
- All right, what's up?
- Nothing.

205
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,182
I didn't want to waste a Saturday night
on a bat mitzvah anyway.

206
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,957
You guys don't wanna
tell me what's up, I ain't going.

207
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,794
- Me neither.
- Ask Vince.

208
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,892
I told you I didn't want
to talk about it in front of them.

209
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:39,234
Them?
Since when are we them?

210
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,603
Next thing you know,
E's gonna be his brother.

211
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,734
You're a fuckin' dick.

212
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,407
Fine. Tell 'em.

213
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,007
Vince isn't over Mandy.
He never has been.

214
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,484
- He's been lying all along.
- What are you talking about?

215
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,215
He told her he loved her today
in front of James fucking Cameron.

216
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,689
- I didn't use those words.
- I thought she was getting married.

217
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,624
- Great Mother of God.
- This is why

218
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,787
we told you to get her
off the movie, E!

219
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,661
Yeah, E, if this movie
gets fucked up, it's on you.

220
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,996
No, look, nothing's
getting fucked up, okay?

221
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,730
I am fine.
I am just living my life.

222
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,604
You know, in fact, I was planning
on living my life again tonight

223
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,232
till you decided to stake
your claim with Sloan

224
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,902
with your new suit
and your fruity new hair.

225
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,171
What?

226
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,771
We all know how you like
to fall in love at the drop of a hat.

227
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,975
Did you ever think that maybe
I was interested too?

228
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,951
What are you talking... you didn't
even remember who she was.

229
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:30,547
Don't worry, E.
You spoke up first.

230
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,887
It's okay.
I'll step down.

231
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,920
I don't need you
to back off.

232
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,057
Oh, E, don't wake
a sleeping giant.

233
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,830
Seriously, E. Take the offer
while it's hot on the table.

234
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,359
I had a connection
with this girl.

235
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,167
So what, she's just
gonna flip to Vice?

236
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,003
You have a 25-mile lead
in the marathon.

237
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,066
Once Vince laces up
his shoes, it's over.

238
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,045
At least if he bangs Sloan,
he'll get over his obsession with Mandy.

239
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,674
It might be worth the sacrifice
to save the movie.

240
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,241
Look, Vince, if you wanna
go for her, go for her.

241
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,219
Okay, fine, I will.

242
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,744
You don't scare me,
you famous fuck.

243
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,853
Good move, E.
You're gonna need all your facilities.

244
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,862
My what, idiot?

245
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,961
Did I say that wrong?

246
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,976
Mazel tov.

247
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,246
Congratulations.
You look beautiful.

248
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:38,384
Look at Terrance. I guarantee you
his relatives worked with Nazis.

249
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,825
- Ari, compose yourself.
- Compose myself? You hate Melinda too.

250
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:45,228
- Quiet. I don't hate anybody.
- Mazel tov, Ari.

251
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,732
Hello, darling.
You look great! Beautiful.

252
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,668
- Thank you.
- Hey, princess!

253
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,035
- Melinda, it's so great to see you.
- You too!

254
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,063
- You look fabulous.
- Thank you.

255
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,507
Being a housewife
certainly agrees with you.

256
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,876
Playing a raging bitch on TV certainly
agrees with you. You're so natural.

257
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:04,440
If you hadn't quit acting at 25
it might have been you on a hit TV show.

258
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,919
- Honey, I need a drink.
- I think I need a drink too.

259
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,446
Hey, I'm looking forward
to my sit down with our boy.

260
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:15,985
"Sit down."

261
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,997
That schnitzel-Ioving
fuck is trying to steal Vince... hi.

262
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,295
- Nice to see you. Welcome.
- Hello.

263
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,631
Speaking of Vince,
why did he bring three dates?

264
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,159
That's the way it comes,
a package deal.

265
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,671
Where am I gonna sit them?

266
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,332
I already talked
to the caterer... hi.

267
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,706
Everything's taken care of.
Don't worry about it.

268
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:34,179
Why are me and Drama sitting at table 19
and you guys are sitting at table six?

269
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:37,273
Relax, Turtle. Ari probably just
wants to spread out the celebs.

270
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,479
Not to mention I haven't seen
a single edible item since we got here.

271
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,714
We just passed a sushi bar
right there, Turtle.

272
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,883
- Cooked items, E.
- The yellowtail is amazing.

273
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,894
- Patience, Turtle.
- Hey, you boys missed temple.

274
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,691
We thought that was
for Jews only.

275
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:54,221
Hi, Vince. Thanks so much
for coming to my bat mitzvah.

276
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:55,995
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

277
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,833
- Look at you. You look beautiful.
- Thanks, so do you.

278
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,965
You look great too, E. What'd you do,
raid the boys department at Macy's?

279
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,942
You look pretty good too.
You auditioning for "Guys and Dolls"?

280
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,537
Hey, boys, enjoy yourselves.
Tonight we eat like kings.

281
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,810
- 500 a head.
- I'm starving.

282
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,840
- I told you,
- Smoke more weed, Turtle.

283
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,852
Seriously, smoke more weed.

284
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,016
She is pretty, huh?

285
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,617
Ivy Leaguer too?

286
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,560
I thought you didn't remember
anything about her.

287
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,530
Things are starting
to come back.

288
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,589
I think I'm gonna
ask her to dance.

289
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,295
- Oh, unless, of course, you wanna...
- Fuck you.

290
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,826
Oh, I forgot,
you don't dance.

291
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,567
Great, you get a leg up on me
because you've been training

292
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,371
for the "Saturday Night Fever"
remake for the last 20 years.

293
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,071
I don't understand what you do
at these things if you don't dance.

294
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,603
- Why're you doing this?
- Why'd you tell the guys about Mandy

295
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,811
- when I asked you not to?
- So what is this, payback?

296
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,012
- I'm heading over.
- I'm heading over with you.

297
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,490
So what show did you say
you were on again?

298
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,131
"Viking Quest."

299
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,060
What did he say?

300
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,577
Excuse me, honey.
What time's dinner? We're starving.

301
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,943
Didn't you eat all
the appetizers after temple?

302
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,413
No, we missed temple.

303
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,780
Sinners.
It's going to be a while.

304
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,786
I wanna kill you, Drama.

305
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,721
So what exactly
were you doing in Italy?

306
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,783
A friend was opening a restaurant
and I kinda helped her manage it.

307
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,316
God, what a coincidence.

308
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:30,919
E used to manage
an Italian restaurant also.

309
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,225
Really?

310
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,494
- Well, yeah...
- Don't be embarrassed.

311
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,933
It was the biggest Sbarro's
in all of Kew Gardens.

312
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:40,564
I love Sbarro's. I go to the one
at the Beverly Center all the time.

313
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,268
- Great sauce, right?
- Yeah.

314
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,301
Hey, Vince, my dad is dying
to get a word in with you.

315
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,677
- Would you mind if I went to get him?
- By all means.

316
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,443
Okay, I'll be right back.

317
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,352
Already wants me
to meet the family.

318
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,251
You're seriously
starting to annoy me.

319
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,756
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention?

320
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,622
Excuse me, could I
get your attention?

321
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,628
Before I bring up
the special family members

322
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:06,062
for the lighting
of the candle ceremony,

323
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:09,761
I would love to say a couple things
about this little girl right here.

324
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,896
You know,
when she was born

325
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,031
I have to be honest,
I wanted a boy.

326
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,042
Easy!

327
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,044
Wait a minute.
Give me a break here.

328
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:22,070
Now I didn't have any sisters
and I didn't know what to expect.

329
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,683
But this little girl
changed my life.

330
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,243
And, um...

331
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,721
watching her blossom
into a woman

332
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,385
has been one of the most
remarkable things

333
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,917
that I have ever seen.

334
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,266
And from the time
she could walk

335
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,996
she would come into our room
and she would jump on our bed

336
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,197
and she would wake us up
and we couldn't sleep.

337
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:49,105
- I'd get about two hours of sleep...
- Vince, this is my father.

338
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,403
- Hello.
- Nice to see you.

339
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,376
And this is his wife
Melinda Clark.

340
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,003
- Hi.
- Hello.

341
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,014
- And, Daddy, this is Eric Murphy.
- Ah.

342
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,710
When was the last time
we saw each other?

343
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,879
Oh, it's been a while. I think
since the Christmas party last year.

344
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,888
Oh, that's right.
That's right.

345
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,753
We should let them
get acquainted.

346
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,759
- You wanna get a drink?
- Yeah.

347
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,785
- We'll be at the bar.
- So, Vince, I have to say,

348
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,423
I finally saw "Head On."
I just have to say it was...

349
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,923
- fabulous. Simply fabulous.
- Yeah.

350
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:20,268
We finally found her
asleep under our bed.

351
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,274
And she didn't wake us.

352
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,908
But she wanted
to be near us.

353
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,414
And I hope that she always will.

354
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,617
Now, I would love to invite

355
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,991
some of the family members...
who's coming up now?

356
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,326
- Grandpa Manny. We've got cousin...
- Grandpa Manny,

357
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,127
or as Sara likes
to call him "Munchie..."

358
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,361
I would love
to come up here.

359
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,063
He's that...
he's that special...

360
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,538
special breed
of grandfather...

361
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,541
You know what?
A better idea I think

362
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,567
would be to bring up
Sarah's star crush,

363
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:03,012
Vinnie Chase,
to cut the challah.

364
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:06,449
Everybody put it together
for Vinnie Chase.

365
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,878
- Ari, what the hell are you doing?
- Vinnie Chase!

366
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,914
Come on up and cut
the challah.

367
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,759
Look at that gorgeous
piece of bread.

368
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:26,760
It's like a big baked cloud.

369
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:30,172
Imagine making
a six-foot hero out of that thing.

370
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:34,703
A little mortadella,
some gabagol, provolone.

371
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,818
Let's get this party started, huh?
DJ Quick. Everybody dance,

372
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,323
What about the blessing
and the lighting of the candles?

373
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:48,019
What more boring way to kill
a party than to get 30 people up here

374
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,687
and light a fucking candle?

375
00:18:58,103 --> 00:18:59,570
Thank God.

376
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,242
What did you guys order?

377
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,245
Uh, we didn't order anything.
We were late.

378
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,578
- But we'll take whatever you've got.
- Well...

379
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,607
what I got is

380
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,846
two kosher vegetarians.

381
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,788
Do you need some salt?

382
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,257
Excuse me, sir.

383
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,955
I will give you $100
for that prime rib.

384
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,988
What'd he say?

385
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:32,203
Oh, I love this song.

386
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,068
Do you want to dance?

387
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,438
Oh, you know what?
I really... I don't dance.

388
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,568
Oh, come on.
It'll be fun.

389
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,771
No, not for you.
People will be looking at you.

390
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,110
- It'll be horrifying, trust me.
- What's up, kids?

391
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,708
- You guys having a good time?
- Well, we were,

392
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,844
but Eric here refuses
to dance with me.

393
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,285
Really? Why?

394
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,449
Well, he says he doesn't
like to dance.

395
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,289
Since when? E, come on,
you used to love to dance as a child.

396
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,888
You know what? He's a little insecure.
I'll talk to him.

397
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:06,932
Okay, fine.
I did lie about the past.

398
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,769
But I really believed
I was over her.

399
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:11,605
And then I saw her and I realized
I wasn't. What do you want me to do?

400
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,270
Get over her.
Go make the movie.

401
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,007
This coming from
my manager or my best friend?

402
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:19,177
Both. Look, she's in love with
someone else. She's getting married.

403
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,482
Thanks, buddy.

404
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:23,954
Hey, Sloan.

405
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,287
E wants you
to dance with me

406
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,623
so we can teach him
a couple moves.

407
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,788
We'll be back later.

408
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,668
Shalom aleichem.

409
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,271
That's Hebrew for
"What time do you get off tonight?"

410
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,803
Cute.

411
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,611
Ignore his inappropriate
sexual advances.

412
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,675
We're looking
for one thing... meat.

413
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,186
How stoned are you guys?

414
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,051
- What?
- No.

415
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,080
I know exactly
what you need.

416
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,648
Come on, boys.

417
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:31,083
Unbelievable. He's pimping
his own daughter out.

418
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,921
Sarah, come here, baby.
Angel, come here.

419
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,553
- Stop it, Ari.
- Honey, go get your star crush.

420
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,529
- Go ask him to dance right now.
- Shut up, Daddy!

421
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,497
- You're so embarrassing me.
- "Shut up, Daddy."

422
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,466
She's really a woman now.
I have to get used to it.

423
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,196
- You are being ridiculous.
- I'm being...

424
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,761
That's exactly what you said
at the "Bill and Ted" premiere

425
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:50,206
when Terrance said, "I'll take Keanu,
you take the other guy."

426
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:53,473
Ari, you've idolized Terrance
since you were 20 years old

427
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,878
and you've let him take
advantage of you ever since.

428
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,405
So stop it now.

429
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,044
You're right, baby.

430
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,611
- Just be a man.
- "Just be a man." Really?

431
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,714
You give me the whole
heartfelt pump-up speech

432
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:08,248
and then you say just go
be a man? Come on.

433
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,837
- I need to speak to you.
- Hmm?

434
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,506
I need to speak to you.

435
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,446
- Ahem, I'm dancing with my wife...
- Now.

436
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,473
Excuse me, darling.

437
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,247
This better be good.

438
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,200
- Where's my joint?
- Where's the goods?

439
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:50,861
Turn to your right.

440
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:55,032
A kids' buffet? Sweet!

441
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:57,541
- Thank you.
- We got hot dogs,

442
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,204
and chicken and pizza.

443
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,740
Mac and cheese, baby!

444
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,079
Vince is my client.

445
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,317
I took him from nothing,
all right?

446
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:14,792
And now he is on the cusp.
I ain't sharin' him.

447
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:17,920
You know, when I started
this company in 1971,

448
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:20,454
my mantra was:
"Every client

449
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,491
should be represented by
every agent in the building."

450
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:26,766
And, yes, all right,
technically, he is your client.

451
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:31,606
- But this is my agency.
- And I'm a fucking partner.

452
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:35,044
Well, I've had more
than a few partners.

453
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,048
Not all of them
have lasted.

454
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,846
- Enjoy your evening.
- Ha.

455
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,322
Mm...

456
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,086
Mm!

457
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,685
Good living, huh, kids?

458
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,992
No doubt.

459
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,691
You got a light?

460
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,724
You've gotta be kidding me.
Turtle, look at this kid.

461
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,601
Jesus Christ! What, are you 13
and you're getting high?

462
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:01,503
You're not gonna
give us a lecture, are you?

463
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,407
No, not a lecture,
a life lesson.

464
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,139
We know. You're talking
to former addicts.

465
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,272
Weed is
a gateway drug, son.

466
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:12,909
One day you're lighting up in full view
of a dozen adults at a bat mitzvah,

467
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,647
the next you're cruising
Santa Monica Boulevard

468
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,712
offering hand jobs
for a crack rock.

469
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,553
Which one of you did that?

470
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,887
Just put the joint down, kid.

471
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,521
Just give me a light,
old man,

472
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,759
or I'll tell my dad
you put your hand on my knee.

473
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:35,669
Enough about Mandy.
What's the deal with your friend Eric?

474
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,265
Eric? I mean,
Eric's the best.

475
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,574
He's got good values,
smart, loyal.

476
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:43,979
I highly recommend him, although
right now he's probably mad at me

477
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,710
because he thinks
I'm out here working you.

478
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,377
What, you didn't tell him

479
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,115
- I don't date actors?
- How would I know that?

480
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,283
I told you that at the Christmas party
when you were working me.

481
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,259
Really? Was I?

482
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,557
Come on.

483
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,621
Hello?

484
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,928
Cheer up, E.
It's a celebration.

485
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,094
- Where's Vince?
- He disappeared with Sloan.

486
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,796
Probably at
the tennis courts.

487
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,203
I hear that's where you fuck
at the Beverly Hilton.

488
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,868
The fact that he went after
this girl purely out of spite,

489
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,571
- I may never speak to him again.
- Don't be so overly sensitive.

490
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,807
It's like getting mad at the bull
for giving you the horns

491
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,145
when you shouldn't have been
in the ring in the first place.

492
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,708
- Fuck you guys for encouraging him.
- Come on, Turtle,

493
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,982
- let's go work the waitress staff.
- No, fuck that.

494
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,046
They just wheeled out
the dessert cart.

495
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,081
Do-it-yourself sundaes?
Oh, man.

496
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,683
Sprinkles.

497
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,824
- Hey.
- Hey!

498
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,495
Where's Vince?

499
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,971
Oh, he got a phone call
from Mandy and he left.

500
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:43,839
- You're kidding me.
- He said you'd react that way.

501
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,672
But you gotta stop
worrying about him.

502
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,405
What else did he day?

503
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:50,141
He said that you're
a great guy

504
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:53,116
and that you've been
his best friend his whole life,

505
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:56,018
and that I should just drag you
onto the dance floor.

506
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,690
Come on,
it's a slow song.

507
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,881
I was a little surprised
that you called. What's going on?

508
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,549
I... I wanted to tell you

509
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,991
that Chris and I are gonna
be taking a little break.

510
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:37,426
Aw, that's too bad.

511
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:40,727
Look, you know, if you need
a friend, of course I'll be there...

512
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:44,360
Vince, I have enough friends.

513
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:47,200
The truth is... if we're being
upfront with one another...

514
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,635
I'm not over you either.

515
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,542
- Really?
- Really.

516
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:59,806
You wanna go get
a cup of coffee and talk about it?

517
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,562
Is that Vince?

518
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,228
Is that Mandy?
