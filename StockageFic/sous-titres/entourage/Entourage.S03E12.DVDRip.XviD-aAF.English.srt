1
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,719
Fuck you doing, Vince?

2
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,796
- I can't sleep.
- Why not?

3
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,471
I think we should fire Ari.

4
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,713
- What's wrong?
- I had a nightmare.

5
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,637
Was I with another man?

6
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,671
No, Vince was.

7
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,868
I think he's gonna fire me today.

8
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,278
He screwed up good this time.
There's no denying it.

9
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,279
You had this movie, a movie that you love,
and he fucked it up.

10
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,038
Put a bullet in him. Be done with it.

11
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,197
- Leave the gun, take the cannolis.
- You're quiet, Johnny.

12
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,117
Everyone should just take a moment,

13
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,072
try my eggs Florentine and take a deep breath.

14
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,476
You think I should keep Ari even after this?

15
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,670
I'm not sure what you should do, bro.

16
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,154
But you don't make a decision this big
on emotion.

17
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,714
And you don't make it till you know what's next.

18
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,752
- What do you mean?
- Nobody appreciates their girlfriend

19
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,075
until they get herpes from the next broad.

20
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,190
- Know what I'm saying?
- No, I don't.

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,310
- Do you know what he's saying?
- Nope.

22
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,749
I'm saying you don't dump your girlfriend

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,075
until you're flirting with other young hotties.

24
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,680
See what other agents are out there.

25
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,836
- It's not a bad idea.
- I do have a couple.

26
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,917
Yeah, I'll meet other agents after I fire Ari.

27
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,110
I like it, Vince. Icy cold.

28
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,469
You know it. Give him a call, E.

29
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,397
Oh, yeah, real icy.

30
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,954
Fine, I'll call.

31
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,278
- Hi, E.
- It's not E, Lloyd. It's Vince. Hi.

32
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,117
Hi, Vince.

33
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,674
- Is he in?
- I'm not sure. Hold on, let me check.

34
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,712
It's Vince.

35
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,588
This is starting early. Tell E I'll call him back.

36
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,710
It's not E, Ari. It's Vince.

37
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,478
Vince? He called himself?

38
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,032
Jesus Christ, this is not good.

39
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,752
- Tell him I'm not here.
- Really?

40
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,473
First rule as an agent is,
never take an angry client's call

41
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,715
unless you have good news to make him smile.

42
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,672
Now go make any excuse,
and get Alan Gray on the phone.

43
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,711
- I already called.
- Call him again.

44
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,753
I gotta get Vince's movie back.
Now go, Lloyd, go!

45
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,109
I am so sorry, Vince. He is not here.

46
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,392
Oh, well... then when he gets in,
tell him I'd like to have lunch.

47
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,193
He wants to have lunch.

48
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,391
Vince, I've got his schedule.
There's no way he can make lunch.

49
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,159
He has a ginormously important lunch
already planned.

50
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,714
OK, then tell him to call me back.

51
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,273
OK, I will.

52
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,993
Why the fuck did you say
I had a more important lunch?

53
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,474
- Will that put a smile on his face?
- What should I say?

54
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,638
That I have a huge wart on my cock
that needs removal would have been better.

55
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,750
Wake the fuck up, Lloyd.

56
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,399
- That's Alan Gray's assistant.
- What does it say?

57
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,556
It says, "Alan will see you at 10:30."

58
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,195
It's 10:10. How the fuck
am I gonna make it to the Valley?

59
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,151
By running, Ari, by running!

60
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,999
- He had a ginormously huge lunch.
- Is that even a word?

61
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,474
- I don't know.
- Well, whether it is or it isn't

62
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,035
he should be eating breakfast,
lunch and dinner with you.

63
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,150
He should be over here
making the fucking beds.

64
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,668
- Ari doesn't like us any more.
- Boutique Ari loved us.

65
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,030
- Big Agency Ari doesn't.
- Ari does not appreciate the little guy.

66
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,593
Have I become the little guy?

67
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,438
- It's just an expression,
- This is every agency card

68
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,948
any of us have been
handed over the past five years.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,718
You saved 'em all?

70
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,354
Yeah, like there's
something weird about that.

71
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,436
Come on, we each pick one. Bro.

72
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,989
Fuck it. Ari's a dick. Let's flirt.

73
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,753
- OK, Rick Zimmerman, InterTalent.
- Didn't they close in, like, 1990?

74
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,792
That was given to me during
my Midnight Caller recurring.

75
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,592
Why don't we just call Terence?

76
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,595
Have Vince repped by E's girlfriend's father?
What if she dumps him?

77
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,757
- It's a good point.
- Please. I'll call the majors.

78
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,631
Make this easy.

79
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,875
Yeah, I remember her.

80
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,956
Bitch.

81
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,193
23 minutes to the Valley.
I'm like Chuck Yeager.

82
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,034
- He's waiting. Do you need a drink?
- I'm all good.

83
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,792
- Morning, Alan.
- You've got two minutes, Ari.

84
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,593
- Be grateful for that.
- I am, Alan, I am.

85
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,315
So let me guess. This Ramones project
has been causing some discomfort

86
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,078
between you and your biggest client.

87
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,671
Haemorrhoids cause discomfort, Alan.
This is more like open-heart surgery.

88
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,790
Maybe you should take this as a sign, Ari.

89
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,799
You made your name in TV packaging,
maybe talent relations isn't your thing.

90
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,674
Why the hell are you mad at me, Alan?
I did everything I could to get Vince on A2.

91
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,597
He's a kid. He made a mistake.

92
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,596
You know he'd kill as Joey Ramone.

93
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,394
Well, maybe he would, maybe he wouldn't.

94
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,477
But I do know that Jake Gyllenhaal
definitely will.

95
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,159
I saw some of his camera tests for A2.
He's brilliant.

96
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,077
You know what my only regret is, Ari?

97
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,997
That I didn't put Jake in A1.

98
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,793
Because I can only imagine
it would have been even bigger.

99
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,513
Alan, that's not really fair, OK?
Vince was great.

100
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,233
Dana, you're here to take notes,
not offer opinions.

101
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,070
Since there really aren't any notes to be taken,
you don't need to be here at all, do you?

102
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,793
Come to think of it, neither do I.

103
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,671
It's two minutes, Ari. Goodbye.

104
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,517
Hard to believe that
you've been divorced three times, Alan.

105
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,713
This is weird. I've never had another agent.

106
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,877
- I don't even know what to look for.
- Let me be your guide.

107
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,913
Over the years, I've developed a foolproof
system for judging the merits of an agency.

108
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,032
You've had practice,
seeing how often you've been dropped.

109
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,390
Never officially dropped.
One did move without telling me.

110
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,432
- So what's your system?
- I judge an agency on four categories.

111
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,552
Decor, service, amenities and ambience.

112
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,511
Give up to ten points for each category.

113
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,154
The agency with the highest overall score wins.

114
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,590
I devised it for my visits to day spas,
but it's perfectly applicable.

115
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,998
I'm sure there's a direct correlation between
Vince's career and your anti-ageing regimen.

116
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,076
I give 'em a six for decor.

117
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,079
I mean, what kind of self-respecting agency
has fake plants in their lobby?

118
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,395
They're not fake. There's a girl watering them.

119
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,158
Maybe the water's fake.

120
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,112
Hi, Vince. I'm Vanessa, Gene's assistant.

121
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,230
- I love the decor.
- Hi.

122
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,430
- And you must be Eric, hi.
- How are you?

123
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,391
I'm Turtle. How you doing?

124
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,876
- And you are?
- Not for sale, honey.

125
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,434
Everyone's waiting at the conference room.

126
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,995
- If you gentlemen would like to follow me.
- We'll be out soon.

127
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,634
Didn't even offer us a drink. Zero for service.

128
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,198
Yeah, but still, I'd give 'em a ten for amenities
if she'll let me service that ass.

129
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,032
The way we see it,
you're not just an actor, Vince.

130
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,150
You're not just a movie star.

131
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,668
You, sir, are a brand.

132
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,149
Mercedes...

133
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,713
Coca-Cola...

134
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,548
two of the most
recognisable names on the planet.

135
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,229
We intend to make you
as popular as both of them.

136
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,311
Vince has called three times, Ari.

137
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,555
That's three times more than all of last year.

138
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,398
I know. He keeps calling me too,
and I got an email.

139
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,112
I didn't even know he knew how to do that.

140
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,878
- I have other information.
- Yeah.

141
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,319
It's also regarding Vince.

142
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,397
Speak or I will intern you like it's 1942.

143
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,510
- I am not Japanese, Ari.
- Speak!

144
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,874
Vince is taking a meeting with another agency.

145
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,797
- How do you know that?
- The Gay Mafia

146
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,559
has been replaced
by the Gay Assistant Corps, Ari.

147
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,591
We know all.

148
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,552
He'll be at Le Petit Four
at 1:30, meeting with Andy Left.

149
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,717
Jesus, he's gonna humiliate me in public
after all these years.

150
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,274
I know. It's all so sinister.

151
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,311
- I hate break-ups.
- It ain't over yet.

152
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,635
Call Left's office and tell him it's Eric.

153
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,432
- Oh, it's Hitler's evil twin.
- I need to talk to you.

154
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,836
Dana, I've only ever enjoyed talking
to you when your mouth was full.

155
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,156
- Is that nice?
- Ari, I have Left's office.

156
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,316
- Hey, Mr Murphy.
- Hey, bro, listen,

157
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,557
I hate to cancel on such short notice,
but Vince can't make lunch.

158
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,831
- Sorry, bro.
- Oh, my God. Hold on. Let me get Andy.

159
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,317
You don't need to do that. Just tell him
he's a great big fag. All right, see ya.

160
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,592
- That's nice.
- You ain't seen nothing yet. What's up, Dana?

161
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,359
I'll tell you something,
but swear it won't come back to me.

162
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,152
- Hand on heart.
- Ari, please.

163
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,111
I swear.

164
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,878
Alan's not gonna make this movie.

165
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,913
He bought it just to spite Vince,
and he's gonna stick it in a drawer.

166
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,349
Jesus, he really is crazy.

167
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,834
Why are you telling me?

168
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,077
Because I hate working for him,
and I want out.

169
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,714
And, Ari, come on. I mean, I love this movie.

170
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,197
I grew up on the Ramones, and I love it
for Vince, so get me on as a producer.

171
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,399
Sure. How?

172
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,352
- It's Alan's movie.
- No, not yet it isn't.

173
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,630
They're still negotiating Bob's perk package.

174
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,194
So just make sure
he doesn't sign those papers.

175
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,875
Dana, I have never cheated on my wife,
not since she became my wife,

176
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,388
but if you want to jerk me in the car
right now, I'm game.

177
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,829
Rain check, Ari.

178
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,518
- Little corporate, huh?
- It felt like Trump's boardroom.

179
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,235
Well, an overall score of 22.5
doesn't bode well for them anyway.

180
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,556
But if that assistant calls me back,
maybe we should go with 'em.

181
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,195
- Hasn't Vince gotten you laid enough?
- What's your definition of enough?

182
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,071
- The search continues.
- Hi, how are you?

183
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,838
We're here to meet Andy Left for lunch.

184
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,031
Andy Left... Cancelled
his reservation over an hour ago.

185
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,389
- Are you sure?
- That's what it says, yeah.

186
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,431
The guy doesn't even bother to call you?

187
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,278
That's a substantial point loss
in the service area.

188
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,756
Forget about points, Turtle.
That earns Left a bitch-slap.

189
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,837
Take it easy. I'll get to the bottom of this.

190
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,755
- Andy Left's office.
- Hey, Lamar, right?

191
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,678
It's Eric Murphy. I'm outside
Le Petit Four with Vincent Chase.

192
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,438
They said Andy cancelled lunch.

193
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,313
- You cancelled lunch, Eric.
- I didn't cancel anything.

194
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,716
And I suppose that
you didn't call Andy a big fag, either.

195
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,955
- What?
- Andy would have shed blood,

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,470
sweat and tears for Vince,
but he has his principles.

197
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,955
Somebody fucked with us, cancelled our lunch,
said I called Andy a big fag.

198
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,353
- Ari.
- Definitely!

199
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,755
- He's cockblocking, Vin.
- But how did he know?

200
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,712
Because he's Ari,
and he's a dirty sweaty scumbag,

201
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,751
- but he's good.
- Ari, it's E.

202
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,792
You need to call us back now. No answer.

203
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,035
- He's definitely avoiding us.
- Definitely.

204
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,072
It's the right move, like when I wanted
to dump Rhona Davies.

205
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,156
She knew about it, and moved to Australia.

206
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,668
I had to wait two whole years
to tell her we were through.

207
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,039
Fuck it, what's next?

208
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,514
- We got Josh Weinstein at three.
- Really?

209
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,676
How do you think Ari's gonna take that one?

210
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,790
Josh Weinstein?

211
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,671
Are you fucking kidding me?

212
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,553
No. I tried your lunch cancellation trick,
but he was onto it.

213
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,318
Josh fucking Weinstein!

214
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,318
I don't believe it.
I'd rather Vince fucked my wife.

215
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,119
Just keep me informed, Lloyd.

216
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,628
Open up the goddamn door, Bob!

217
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,275
Go away, Ari,
or I'm calling my security company.

218
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,231
And they're all ex-Navy SEALs.

219
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,875
Bob, stop. I come bearing gifts.

220
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,036
I don't want gifts. I want quiet.

221
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,674
Bob, you've known me 20 years.
All right? Let me in.

222
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,635
What kind of gifts do you have?

223
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,792
My car.

224
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,470
750i BMW, 3,300 miles, built-in iPod dock.

225
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,193
Oak dash. It's beautiful.

226
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,834
- You own it, or you lease it?
- I lease it,

227
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,829
but I will continue to make the payments
until it expires, unless you expire first.

228
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,268
You're desperate, huh?

229
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,153
Bob, I will strip naked
and breakdance through Beverly Hills

230
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,589
if it will get you not to sign that deal with Alan.

231
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,835
I don't want your junk.
I want to make a movie.

232
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,472
That's all I ever wanted.

233
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,239
Alan's not going to make
that movie with you, never.

234
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,952
That's complete bullshit.

235
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,560
No, it's not. It's the truth. You gotta trust me.

236
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,989
Trust you?

237
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,917
Why the hell should I trust you?

238
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,316
Because I spoke to someone, Bob,
someone who knows.

239
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,634
- Who?
- Doesn't matter.

240
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,309
- What matters is it's the truth.
- That's not good enough. I need proof.

241
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,358
I can't reveal my sources.

242
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,870
- I promised I wouldn't talk.
- Go home, Ari.

243
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,036
Dana Gordon, VP of production with Alan.

244
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,958
I used to fuck her back in the day,
so she owes me.

245
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,196
- Like the fish.
- Like the artwork.

246
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,038
I like her and her and her.

247
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,039
- Looks like about 40 points to me, huh?
- We haven't seen the underbelly yet.

248
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,516
- There's an underbelly?
- Don't be ignorant, E. There's always one.

249
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,109
Vince, E. I knew someday
our paths would cross again.

250
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,549
- Good to see you, Josh.
- Great to see you, Vince.

251
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,876
And you, Johnny, are you looking
for representation as well?

252
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,957
Heard about the Ed Burns pilot.
It's a great script.

253
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,274
Today, I'll focus on Vince,

254
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,153
but call me tomorrow if you have
needs that aren't being met.

255
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,272
May, get these guys some drinks.

256
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,834
Oh, and, Turtle, all my assistants love to fuck.

257
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,111
I ask 'em when they interview. True story.

258
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,469
Come on in, guys. The whole team's waiting.

259
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,398
- We're so excited.
- I love it here.

260
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,238
Underbelly, Turtle. Underbelly.

261
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,110
- You feeling this?
- Definitely.

262
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,509
Apple...

263
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,037
Canon...

264
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,673
Happy? Or is this madness
that will turn on me on a moment's notice?

265
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,510
This is happiness, Lloyd. This is pure,
heterosexual male happiness.

266
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,074
- So Bob was receptive?
- Bob was lucid.

267
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,554
Bob was coherent. Bob was amiable.

268
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,511
Bob could come to no other conclusion

269
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,994
than to return this film to its rightful owner,

270
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,393
Vincent Chase.

271
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,077
- I like when you're happy.
- Vince was my first discovery.

272
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,190
I built other stars' careers, but he was mine.

273
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,074
I saw him in this commercial, I said,
"This kid has got something," and I was right.

274
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,712
He's more than a client, Lloyd.

275
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,478
He's like my baby.

276
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,556
I love Vince, Lloyd.

277
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,751
Ari Gold's office.

278
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,519
- It's Dana Gordon.
- And I love Dana Gordon too.

279
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,359
I love you, Dana Gordon.

280
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,109
You swore you would keep your mouth shut,
you slimy piece of shit.

281
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,034
Even though I know what a lowlife you are,
I always trusted you.

282
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,799
- Ditto, Dana, ditto.
- But you fucked me.

283
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,309
I was desperate, Dana.

284
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,911
Ari, you have one day to find me another job,
or the next time I see you at The Palm,

285
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,032
I'm going to squeeze your fucking dick
with a claw cracker.

286
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,196
Miss Gordon, I'm afraid
your five minutes are up.

287
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,037
- It's time to go.
- Fuck you!

288
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,719
Put one hand on me, and I scream rape.

289
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,230
This is a classic example
of not judging a book by its cover.

290
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,874
- That place was all surface.
- You were right, Drama.

291
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,276
All surface. I don't believe
any of those assistants love to fuck.

292
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,311
- Couldn't even get a number?
- Not a one.

293
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,874
This is depressing.
Maybe we just go without an agent.

294
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,673
Drama did that for ten years.
Really worked for him.

295
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,039
Suck it, Turtle.

296
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,036
Did you sign those papers, Bob?

297
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,032
You got that poor girl fired, Ari.

298
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,516
- Did you sign them?
- I felt terrible about calling Alan,

299
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,597
but this is my baby,
and she was messing with my baby.

300
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,998
I made a 50-year career, a half-century career
trusting my instincts, Ari.

301
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,996
What the fuck did your instincts tell you?

302
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,918
They told me it's a different world
out there today.

303
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,235
Different players. Different ethics.

304
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,555
Different bullshit.

305
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,709
It's a lot less fun, and I don't like it.

306
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,632
I signed the papers, Ari.

307
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,512
I don't know if I was right,
but I signed the damn papers.

308
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,640
I'm over this town.

309
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,999
I'm sorry.

310
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,149
Yeah, me too, Bob.

311
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,428
Me too.

312
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,152
I don't have anything good to tell Vince.

313
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,476
Just get him on the phone.
Let me take what's coming.

314
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,515
How is it to take it in the ass anyway, Lloyd?

315
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,357
I don't know, Ari. I'm a top.

316
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,390
Come on, really?

317
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,431
Anyway, make the call.

318
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,192
- No.
- No what?

319
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,875
No, I will not call.

320
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,469
Fuck, this is not gonna be another
Queer As Folk pep talks, is it?

321
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,876
Yes, Ari, yes, it is.
And it's gonna be a good one.

322
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,679
You said first rule of an agent
is not to call a client till you have good news.

323
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,234
You have no good news.
But I have news for you, Ari Gold.

324
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,432
Yes, you screwed up. Yes, you were devious.
Yes, you were conniving.

325
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,596
But, yes, you care.

326
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,349
I know that even when you throw
the most hurtful homophobic slurs my way,

327
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,311
that you really do care.

328
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,157
Vince knows that. Just remind him.

329
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,397
You're right, Lloyd. Look at this place.

330
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,911
75,000 square feet all built on my giving a fuck.

331
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,794
Make the call. Tell every agent
in this building to get prepared.

332
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,752
- For what?
- For battle, Lloyd.

333
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,392
For battle.

334
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,840
- Finally.
- Stay strong, Vin.

335
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,918
So, we should talk.

336
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,633
Yeah, Ari, but you're
a tough man to get on the phone.

337
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,272
We should talk in person.

338
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,959
- All right, I'll drop in.
- When can you be here?

339
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,549
- 20 minutes.
- See you then.

340
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,719
He's coming. I'm actually nervous.

341
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,513
- That's cute, Ari.
- Get out of my office, Lloyd.

342
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,790
- Should have just done it on the phone.
- It's the right thing to do.

343
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,479
Look him in the eye,
let him know why this is happening.

344
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,991
Fuck that. Avoid all contact, Vin.
Let him wonder for the rest of his life.

345
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,190
Courtney DeMayo ditched me
on the phone in the first grade.

346
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,516
I'm still wondering and hurting.
The phone break-up is so cruel.

347
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,949
Looking Ari in the eyes is not gonna be easy.

348
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,631
Yeah, and you know he's gonna beg.

349
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,749
I mean, it's so fucking weird.

350
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,189
This is gonna be the last time we drive to Ari's.

351
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,913
- Yep.
- Don't do it.

352
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,353
- What?
- I think it's a mistake.

353
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,629
You saw what all those cookie-cutter guys
were like. They're all the same.

354
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,638
An agent by nature is a lying,
money-hungry cocksucker.

355
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,069
That's the breed, and Ari is best in breed.

356
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,078
How do we know that?
We've never been with anybody else.

357
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,793
I have. I've had 15 different agents
over the years,

358
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,593
and only that few cos I'm a loyal guy.

359
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,473
You don't want to get dropped
when Vince moves on.

360
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,592
If my pilot gets picked up,
I could sign with anyone I want.

361
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,039
And you know what?

362
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,640
I'd stay with Ari.
We know where we stand with him.

363
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,352
He was there from the beginning.

364
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,113
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking he's right.

365
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,118
Ari's been good to us.
He's not like all those other guys.

366
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,515
We know him. He's our friend.

367
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,949
But he did fuck us on this.

368
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,356
And as our friend, he should say he's sorry.

369
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,840
Maybe he will, Vince. Maybe he will.

370
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,597
- What's up, Lloyd?
- Mr Chase.

371
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,200
- Mr Chase?
- Ari wants me to do that today.

372
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,550
- They're waiting in the conference room.
- They?

373
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,716
We'll be enjoying the perfect-ten amenities.

374
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,150
- Even Lloyd's starting to grow on me.
- You think Lloyd's cute?

375
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,191
You know what I mean, asshole.

376
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,910
- Gentlemen, welcome.
- What is this, Ari?

377
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,714
Yeah, Ari. I thought this was supposed
to be more of a face-to-face thing.

378
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,232
It is, Vinnie, it is. It's you face-to-face
with the face of this entire agency.

379
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,352
Gentlemen, please sit down.

380
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,198
Right now, Vince, phones here
are ringing off the hook.

381
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,435
Clients are wondering where their agents are.

382
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,914
- And you know where they are?
- They're in here.

383
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,678
Exactly, and you wanna know why?

384
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,711
It's because we are 100% committed

385
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,955
to giving Vincent Chase all that he needs.

386
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,037
Vinnie, you do not need to hear
about the past today.

387
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,913
I'm not gonna bore you
with details of the past five years

388
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,518
and all we've done together.

389
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,314
I don't need to talk about the fact that
I brought you from obscurity to superstardom.

390
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,351
- Good thing he didn't mention that.
- Yeah.

391
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,075
What you see before you, Vince,
is a full-service agency.

392
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,510
TV division, music division, reality division.

393
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,472
God forbid, Johnny Drama's
pilot does not go,

394
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,398
boom, he's on The Surreal Life, one phone call.

395
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,716
We wanna make you bigger than movies,
Vince.

396
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,513
We wanna take you international.

397
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,115
Microsoft, McDonald's.

398
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,355
Brand-name recognition.

399
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,914
What do you think?

400
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,518
I think I need to think.

401
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,709
It's pathetic, Ari.

402
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,273
Vince, what are you doing?

403
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,788
Ari, I didn't need
the whole dog and pony show.

404
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,638
- I really thought you were different.
- Vince, I am.

405
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,673
Ari, you do things your own way
and you don't give a shit what we think.

406
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,234
I do give a shit.
You should have seen me today,

407
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,157
begging, trying to get that movie back.

408
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,829
But it's gone. The past is the past.
Let's look to the future.

409
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,519
You're unreal.
Even after you fuck up like this,

410
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,836
you can't even muster the strength
to just, as my friend,

411
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,030
look me in the face and say, "I'm sorry."

412
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,231
- That's all you wanted?
- That's all I wanted.

413
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,793
Then I'm sorry, Vin.

414
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,352
It's too late.

415
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,549
- You're fired.
- Let's roll.

416
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,669
English
