1
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,105
The question you've
gotta ask yourself, E,

2
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:16,472
- is are we family?
- Yeah, E, are we family?

3
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,636
What are we
if we're not family?

4
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:21,579
Just four guys who are a little old
to still be living together.

5
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,013
Yeah, and one guy
who's way too old.

6
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,414
Just share the wealth.

7
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,248
You made $200,000
off "Aquaman."

8
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,947
With another $300,000
coming in.

9
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,353
- That is good money.
- Meanwhile, me and Turtle,

10
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,914
we're living beneath
the poverty line.

11
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,984
In the old country everybody gets
a taste off a big score.

12
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,928
- I'm Irish, Turtle.
- Well, I'm not.

13
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,931
And this broke Guinea wants
to wet his beak a little.

14
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:42,332
A quarterback takes care of his
offensive line after a good season.

15
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:43,665
You know that, E.

16
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,263
Otherwise, they let him
get buried the next year.

17
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,399
I feel like I'm getting buried
this year.

18
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:52,002
You better forget gold and check out
something in silver, Drama.

19
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,377
No, bro.
Silver doesn't read on my skin.

20
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,143
What does that watch cost?
$10,000?

21
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,150
You wish.
This is gold, E.

22
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:01,244
Ooh, Saigon is gonna love
this beast.

23
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,118
- Saigon?
- Yeah.

24
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,681
I've got to get something for my client
to welcome him to my company.

25
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,716
You think I'm buying a watch
for your fucking client?

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,990
No, you're paying
for a gift for me.

27
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,497
What I chose to do with it after that,
that's my business.

28
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,500
- Vince?
- Family, E.

29
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,933
Family.

30
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,995
All right, fuck it.

31
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:22,303
Miss, can you give these guys
whatever they want?

32
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,969
Spread it out
over all of these.

33
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,638
So much for paying off
my student loans.

34
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,147
- I'll be outside.
- Told you he wasn't cheap.

35
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,582
Had you all wrong, E.

36
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,643
- Yeah, E, you're good people.
- What?

37
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,381
I don't have to buy
the watches?

38
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,753
No, I'm buying.
I just told them that you would have.

39
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,519
Whew.
Thank God!

40
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,186
Thanks.

41
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,718
- Can I wear mine out, bro?
- Of course, Johnny.

42
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,390
- Me too?
- Yeah.

43
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:46,955
Yeah.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,733
It's 7:35 A.M.
In Senegal...

45
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,329
That's great, Drama.

46
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,068
...and 7:53
in Tikrit.

47
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,475
Minutes don't change, Drama.
Only the hour.

48
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:02,174
- Yeah, like you've ever been to Tikrit.
- Holy shit!

49
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,978
- What?
- Look!

50
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,644
Is that Mandy?

51
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,016
You've got
to be shitting me.

52
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,021
She's stepping out
on baby bro!

53
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,784
Relax! Don't jump
to any conclusions.

54
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,950
Maybe they ran
into each other in there.

55
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,051
And they just happen
to be leaving together?

56
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,823
Yeah, that's what
happens at Gucci...

57
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,331
buy a pair of shoes and they let you
fuck your ex-fiance.

58
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,889
Come on, Turtle,
let's trail them!

59
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,663
Come on, come on!

60
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:26,502
- What should I tell Vince?
- You're representation. Lie!

61
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,302
Let's go!

62
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,777
Where did they go?

63
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,211
Turtle had to meet
with Saigon.

64
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,681
I thought today was
gonna be a leisure day.

65
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,579
Thank you.

66
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,786
- They started without you.
- Ha ha, very funny.

67
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,295
Mr. McQuewick
is in there.

68
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,491
What is this?
April Fools?

69
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,365
...never been in better shape.

70
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,699
I think we have
more A-list clients now

71
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,967
than we've ever
had before.

72
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,998
Ah, Ari.
Good of you to join us.

73
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:06,102
When did the rules
change, though?

74
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,409
I'm not sure what rule
you're referring to,

75
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,916
but I'm sure there have been
some slight adjustments

76
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,646
in the last three years
since you last attended a staff meeting.

77
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:17,486
Well, nobody's ever been allowed
to enter a staff meeting late.

78
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,047
No one.

79
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,957
No exceptions.

80
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,326
Move along, Ari.

81
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,512
Back off a little.
You're too close.

82
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,446
I'm two cars back.
What do you want?

83
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:46,316
Always keep two-fifths of a block
between you and your subject.

84
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,321
Oh, what, have you
done this before, Drama?

85
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,913
Too many times, Turtle.

86
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,822
Too many times.

87
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,187
I'm thinking about taking
a trip to Paris.

88
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,218
Yeah.

89
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,629
I've got a week
before shooting starts.

90
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,134
It's six months
of hell after that.

91
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,136
- Yeah.
- I could use a trip.

92
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,899
I'll tell the boys.

93
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:09,305
No, not with the boys.
With Mandy.

94
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,217
What the fuck are you
taking pictures of?

95
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,879
What do you mean?
Them.

96
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,753
This way when Vince
goes into denial about it,

97
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,123
- it's proof.
- You don't think he'll believe us?

98
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,288
Nobody ever wants to believe
you're being two-timed, Turtle.

99
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,893
How many times
you been cheated on?

100
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,924
Too many, Turtle.

101
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,163
Too many.

102
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:41,640
Mr. McQuewick's on the phone.
He'd like to speak with you.

103
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,643
To apologize?
Send him down.

104
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,110
He wants you
to come up.

105
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,636
- He won't come down?
- He asked me to send you up.

106
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,013
He asked you
to send me up.

107
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,847
Did you tell him
that you don't send me anywhere?

108
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:57,049
Did you tell him that no one sends me
anywhere in this fucking agency?

109
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,684
Did you tell him
that I send myself where I want?

110
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,523
No. I just said okay.

111
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,119
You tell him
to come down.

112
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,638
He'd like to speak
with you.

113
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,038
You see that, Lloyd?
No surrender.

114
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,484
Terrence,
how are you?

115
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,885
Ari, get your ass
up here!

116
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,523
You embarrassed me
in front of my troops.

117
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,652
Rules are rules.

118
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,595
I apologize.

119
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,564
I appreciate that.

120
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,726
- Now, come up!
- You come down.

121
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,004
Conference room...
neutral territory.

122
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,131
- 1:15.
- Done.

123
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,604
How about you and Sloan
come with us?

124
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,613
- To Paris?
- Yeah.

125
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,774
You guys are getting
pretty serious, right?

126
00:06:56,816 --> 00:07:00,115
I don't know.
You know, maybe.

127
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:03,213
What if this is it
for both of us?

128
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,453
I think it's a little early
for that for both of us.

129
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,653
Yeah?
Maybe, maybe not.

130
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,254
Anyway, it's never too early
to go to Paris.

131
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,288
That's true.

132
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,293
- Yo!
- We followed them all morning.

133
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,394
Great!

134
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,599
Don't worry.
They didn't suspect a thing.

135
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,006
I'm dropping Vince off
at Mandy's now, guys.

136
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,010
Good!
She just arrived home.

137
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:28,912
- Where are you?
- Look to your left.

138
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,075
- Was that our car?
- I've gotta go.

139
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,688
It's clear.

140
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,189
That was close.

141
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,324
Thanks.

142
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,291
Think about Paris.

143
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,097
- What's up, baby?
- Hey.

144
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,606
- Where were you?
- I was just shopping with my mom.

145
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,267
Yeah?

146
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,176
- Hey, E!
- Hey!

147
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,271
- How's Sloan?
- She's great.

148
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,010
- Tell her I said hi, okay?
- Yeah, definitely.

149
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,847
Bye.

150
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,518
I mean, she lied
right to his face.

151
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:12,854
Eric, Mandy dated Chris
for three years.

152
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,917
That's a long history.

153
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,929
Maybe they were
just talking,

154
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,455
and she didn't tell Vince because
she didn't want to hurt his feelings.

155
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,968
- You don't know the whole story.
- I know what I saw.

156
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,470
- What did you see?
- The way they were walking.

157
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,132
What do you mean
the way they were walking?

158
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,607
Just their body language.
Stop looking at me like that.

159
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,234
- I'm telling you.
- Telling me what?

160
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,643
You have some unique skill
I don't know about?

161
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,011
- Maybe.
- Hmm.

162
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,516
What does
my body language say?

163
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,247
That we might not
be making it out to lunch today.

164
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,346
Eric, listen to me.

165
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,482
My best friend in high school,
when I told her

166
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,390
that I thought that her boyfriend
was cheating on her

167
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:48,791
she never spoke
to me again.

168
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,796
- Was he?
- Mm-hmm.

169
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,799
- Didn't matter.
- Oh.

170
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,300
Still I've got tell him,
though.

171
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:58,167
- It sucks getting cheated on.
- Yeah, it does.

172
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,297
So, let's agree we'll
never do that to each other

173
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,705
if we ever get serious.

174
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,074
Oh, okay,
if we ever get serious.

175
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,443
Did I totally
just freak you out?

176
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,915
No, of course not.

177
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,542
I want to get serious.
Come here.

178
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,687
Hold on a second.

179
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,321
It's Ari.
This could be important.

180
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:26,524
Hello?

181
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,056
Let me ask you
something.

182
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,364
- You still seeing Sloan?
- Yeah. Why?

183
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,462
She ever say anything
to you about me?

184
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,803
About you? Why would she
say something about you?

185
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,865
I don't mean it like that.
I mean, work-wise.

186
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,035
No.

187
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,045
E, you're my friend.
You'd tell me if she did.

188
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,173
Ari, I'm at Sloan's. Do you want me
to ask her something?

189
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,581
You're with her now?
Why the fuck didn't you say so?

190
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,586
No, I don't want you
to asking her anything.

191
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,316
I don't want you to say anything about
this. Forget this conversation.

192
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,790
Does she already know
we're having this conversation?

193
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,986
- Ari, what's going on?
- Nothing. It's all good.

194
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,291
I'll call you back.

195
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,026
What's going on?

196
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,500
I think Ari and your father
are having problems.

197
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,928
All right,
let's cut to the chase.

198
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,066
- All right.
- I miss this place.

199
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,668
I miss the excitement.
I miss the action.

200
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,805
I'm coming back
full time.

201
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,680
Muhammad Ali came back
once too often too, Terrence.

202
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,582
Stop, Ari.

203
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,644
This is nothing
for you to worry about.

204
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,985
Good. All right then,
I want an extension.

205
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,651
Well, you have a year left
on your deal.

206
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:29,525
When it expires,
as always,

207
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,860
- you'll be taken care of.
- That's not good enough.

208
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,491
I want to know that I'm being
taken care of right now.

209
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,832
You know I have a policy
never to extend active contracts,

210
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,499
but I've always been
fair with you.

211
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,065
You were being fair with me
when you said you were leaving.

212
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,738
You coming back now
is not fair to me.

213
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,110
Not now!

214
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,445
Now I want something,
Terrence.

215
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,474
All right.
All right, Ari.

216
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,448
You know,
I've never done this before.

217
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,729
This is what I'm prepared
to offer you.

218
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,379
No e-mails, no faxes,
no phone calls, no nothing.

219
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:25,077
- Simply silence, Lloyd.
- Ari.

220
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,608
Silence, Lloyd.
It's golden.

221
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,469
- Who's gonna lead this thing?
- I told you, I am.

222
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,232
You guys don't even
need to be here.

223
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:49,002
- I'm his brother, E.
- Yeah, and I'm his best friend.

224
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,066
- Is that official?
- What?

225
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,772
I always thought that me,
you and Vince were best friends?

226
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:57,146
I didn't know that you two
were better friends than me and him.

227
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,845
Or that you and him
are better friends than me and you.

228
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,785
Whatever, Turtle.
You want to tell him, tell him.

229
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,686
No, the guy always
kills the messenger,

230
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,214
never kills the best friend
of the messenger.

231
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:07,555
- Yo!
- What's up, brother?

232
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,493
All right,
what's the emergency?

233
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,122
You see, there's one head
right there.

234
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,064
And there's another one
right there.

235
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,931
- I don't see anything.
- Right there.

236
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,459
If you look straight down
you can almost see

237
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,472
that there's two hands
that are almost holding.

238
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,703
This thing's really not designed
for long-range photography.

239
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,301
Anyway, who is it?

240
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,008
Come on, guys.
Who the fuck is it?

241
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,483
It's Mandy and Chris.

242
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,577
We saw them together
this morning.

243
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,713
This morning?
We were together this morning.

244
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,883
Before that.
You were paying for the watches.

245
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,722
Which we didn't get a chance
to thank you for, by the way.

246
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,991
Thanks, Vince!

247
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,862
- Where you going?
- Gonna call her.

248
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,231
Lloyd!

249
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,263
Mm.

250
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:05,411
This envelope contains
the names of eight agents.

251
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,885
Anyone catches you,
you eat it. Comprende?

252
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,785
Nod if you understand
what I'm saying.

253
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:10,982
I understand.

254
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,287
You can't
just fucking nod?

255
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,486
Lloyd...

256
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,496
I want you to...

257
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,964
pledge your undying
loyalty to me.

258
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,365
- Ari...
- Listen, Lloyd, do you want to make it

259
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,767
or do you want to fold shirts
at a Chinese laundry?

260
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,669
Now pledge.

261
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:29,469
- I pledge my undying loyalty to you.
- Okay.

262
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,033
Now, I want you to go
to each of these agents,

263
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:36,446
discreetly say the words
"tsetse fly."

264
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,951
Say nothing else.

265
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,577
Now, go.

266
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,318
- Ari, are you leaving the agency?
- Shh!

267
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,815
Silence is
fucking golden.

268
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,827
- It's all good.
- How so?

269
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,738
They were just talking.
She didn't want to hurt my feelings.

270
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,469
Come on, guys.
I get it.

271
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,739
They were gonna
get married next week.

272
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,268
Anyway, I'm gonna
go the bathroom.

273
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,780
Are you gonna drive me
to her house afterwards?

274
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,247
Sure.

275
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,045
Denial... stage one.

276
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,848
We ought to go over
to Chris's house and whoop his ass.

277
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:15,876
Yeah.

278
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:18,151
Guys, remember, Vince
took Mandy from Chris.

279
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,182
- He should whoop Vince's ass.
- Who's side you on?

280
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:22,922
I'm just saying,
what if it was nothing?

281
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,725
They rented movies
at Blockbuster.

282
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,731
Maybe they were
returning movies they already had.

283
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:31,130
- Is that what you think, E?
- No.

284
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,138
- It's not what I think.
- Yeah, me neither.

285
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,901
- Come on, Turtle, let's go.
- Where?

286
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,033
Go get the proof we need.
Come on.

287
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,738
- What are you gonna do?
- Don't you worry about it.

288
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,838
Where are they going?

289
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,440
Uh, another
Saigon meeting.

290
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,917
You know how hard it is
to get a rapper to sign a contract.

291
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:50,581
Those fuckers
never say goodbye.

292
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,885
Tsetse fly.

293
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,225
Tsetse fly.

294
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,458
Tsetse fly.

295
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,398
Hamburger Hamlet,
right?

296
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,925
Tsetse fly, Davies.
That's all that you're supposed to say.

297
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,938
- Everything else stays the same.
- I'm sorry.

298
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,202
- I forgot what it means.
- Well, you just said it.

299
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,708
- The Hamlet?
- Yes.

300
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,803
Right, the Hamlet.
Nobody who works in this business

301
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,871
- would ever be caught dead there.
- You know what?

302
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,975
You better lock down
some really good clients.

303
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,491
Look, if you have
something to say

304
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:28,823
why don't you
just say it?

305
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,692
Look, when you guys
told me you thought

306
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,027
Kristen was cheating on me it hurt,
but you were right.

307
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,295
Now you're comparing
Mandy to Kristen?

308
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,995
No! I'm not even
saying she's cheating.

309
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,765
Then what
are you saying?

310
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:43,036
I'm just saying
it didn't look like it was over to me.

311
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,305
- What do you mean? They were kissing?
- No.

312
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,505
- Were they holding hands?
- No.

313
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,446
Then what made it
look like it wasn't over?!

314
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,712
- I don't know. Instinct.
- Whatever.

315
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,412
- You asked me what I was thinking.
- Now you told me

316
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,320
and I don't want to hear
about it again, okay?

317
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,222
Okay.

318
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,022
You think you
got enough cash?

319
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:09,398
Live and learn.
You throw around enough dough

320
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,403
you can find out
anything you want.

321
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,200
What exactly are we
trying to find out?

322
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,933
We already know
they rented a movie.

323
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,669
Yeah, but what movie?

324
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,439
"Texas Chainsaw Massacre"
might say one thing.

325
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:23,505
"91/2 Weeks" would say something
very different.

326
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:27,007
There is no way I can tell you
what movie Mandy Moore rented.

327
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,043
I would get fired.

328
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,357
Are you joking?

329
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,291
There's more where
that came from.

330
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,921
I value my job.
I cannot be bought.

331
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,128
Psst!

332
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,197
- Your Vinnie Chase's brother, right?
- That's right.

333
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,729
Yeah, I saw you
on "Celebrity Justice."

334
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,833
You busted up that guy's car
with a golf club.

335
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,673
That was on "CJ"?

336
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,406
- Yeah.
- Sweet!

337
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,914
You got anything
to tell us?

338
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,440
Break out that money clip again
and I just might.

339
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,814
Just tell me what
this is about, Ari.

340
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,482
I just want to have
a private dinner

341
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,320
with you and Vince
as soon as possible.

342
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,155
To discuss what?
You're freaking me out!

343
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,286
There's no need
to freak out, E.

344
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,990
It's all good.
Believe me.

345
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,295
Just think of it as a
state of the union address

346
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,130
for all my A-listers.

347
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,760
Hold on.
Yeah?

348
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,737
Code red, Ari!
Code red!

349
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,536
- What are you talking about?
- He knows! He knows!

350
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,303
- Who knows what?
- Mr. McQuewick.

351
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,444
I think you're
the first one to arrive.

352
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,414
Oh, fuck!

353
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,455
Lloyd, pack up
all my files.

354
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,117
Pile everything
you see into a box.

355
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,787
Everything! You see a used condom,
an executioner's mask,

356
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,295
and a goddamn
spiked paddle,

357
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,490
don't think, just pack
that bitch! Chop suey!

358
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:54,970
Ernesto!
Keep it up front

359
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,838
and keep it running!

360
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,841
- Ari, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

361
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,580
- Sorry, Ari.
- Don't sweat it, Peter.

362
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,588
- It's too bad, Ari.
- It's all right, man.

363
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,852
- Sorry, bro.
- It's okay. It ain't your fault.

364
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,950
You should be
a nicer person.

365
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,753
Maybe then people
wouldn't fuck you.

366
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:21,027
You talked, Davies?

367
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,897
- Hey, Adam.
- Yeah, Ari?

368
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,493
Just so you know,
your girlfriend

369
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,027
when she was in the mailroom,
she offered to blow me.

370
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,267
True story.

371
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,822
People, we have
a traitor in our midst.

372
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:52,092
Let this be a lesson
to all of you.

373
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,429
You're making a very big mistake,
Terrence.

374
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,492
That's what Arthur Jensen
said in 1973.

375
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,733
He was the first
conspirator that I ever dealt with.

376
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,763
Try finding
him now, Ari.

377
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,538
He's selling auto insurance
in Reseda.

378
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,545
Okay, people,

379
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,103
most of you
are sitting there

380
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,548
and you're looking
at this good-Iooking old man

381
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,744
and you're wondering,
"Who the fuck is he?"

382
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,413
And you know what?
That's exactly what you should be doing.

383
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:20,084
You all know who's been running
this company for the past eight years.

384
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,958
And you all know
that when I go,

385
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:27,022
in no time you will be repping nobodys
like Bill from "The Apprentice."

386
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,625
No one needs to make
a decision right now.

387
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,966
I will be starting
my own agency.

388
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,529
Two very important goals
will apply...

389
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,541
to make everyone
who is in

390
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,874
at the ground floor rich,
and to burn

391
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,403
this motherfucking
place to the ground!

392
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,438
Lloyd, are you
with me?

393
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,961
Lloyd,
what are you doing?

394
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,657
You and me have a special bond.
Come on, let's go.

395
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,062
Ari, swear to me
that you will never again say anything

396
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:09,130
offensive to me
about my race or sexual orientation.

397
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,607
I can't swear to that,

398
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:13,304
but I promise I will
always apologize after.

399
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,391
Phone numbers, messages,
anything you remember, write it down.

400
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,092
Get Shauna Roberts,
have her start

401
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:37,431
drafting a press release
for tomorrow's "Variety" all right?

402
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,232
Ernesto!

403
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,863
Where's my fucking car?

404
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,067
I'll get him.

405
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,769
You kidding me?

406
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,170
My phone's dead!

407
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,477
Company phone.
I think they had it turned off.

408
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,246
Hello?

409
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,652
It's Lloyd looking
for Mr. Gold's car.

410
00:20:56,688 --> 00:21:00,317
Sorry, Lloyd, it's a company car. Mr.
McQuewick said I can't give it to him.

411
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,224
Can't give it to me?!

412
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:07,423
Ernesto, how many
fucking pesos

413
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,229
did I give you
for Christmas?

414
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,032
Huh, Ernesto?
Every Christmas for the past decade?

415
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,833
Half of Mexico

416
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,568
is eating on my tips
that I have given you.

417
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,907
Bring my motherfucking
car now, por favor!

418
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,970
Sorry, Mr. Gold,
I can't do it.

419
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,710
Oh, and Mr. Gold,
I'm from Guatemala,

420
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,718
and our currency
is the quetzal.

421
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,413
I'll get my car.

422
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,488
Fuck!
Ah!

423
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,493
Fuck!

424
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,518
Fuck!

425
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,994
They rented
"Brian's Song," E.

426
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,297
I heard you.
What do you want me to do?

427
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:46,168
- The ultimate guy-cry movie.
- Uh-huh.

428
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,570
He cries in front of her,
shows her he's sensitive.

429
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,006
Bang!
He moves right in.

430
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,567
Yeah, his tears
will basically act as a lubricant.

431
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,307
We said our peace.
There's nothing more we can do.

432
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,009
How's that chicken?

433
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,889
Okay, so,
you're mad at me?

434
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,362
No.
I'm not mad at you.

435
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,490
I guess I should have
told you.

436
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,865
- I'm sorry.
- Well, if there's something to tell...

437
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,927
No. Again,
nothing happened.

438
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,938
Chris and I haven't
been together

439
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,837
since we've
been together.

440
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,364
He just...

441
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:27,242
you know, he begged
to see me today. That's all.

442
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,270
Mm, what did he say?

443
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,846
That he still loved me...

444
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:37,446
and he wanted to make
sure that me and you

445
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,514
weren't just trying
to recapture first love,

446
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:43,585
but if I was sure,
then he was happy for me.

447
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,118
Yeah.

448
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:47,154
Are you sure?

449
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:53,437
How can I be sure?
It's been, what, two weeks?

450
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,269
Well, I'm sure.

451
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,298
Really?

452
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,469
Huh.

453
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:04,577
Because...

454
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:07,585
I'm sorry.
I'm not, Vince.

455
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,314
I'm not sure.

456
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:14,485
I'm just...
I'm really confused. I can't lie.

457
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:17,154
Because on one hand
I think about you

458
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:20,289
and the way that
you make me feel

459
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,062
and how I felt
five years ago.

460
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,027
And then
on the other hand,

461
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,767
I think about him <i>and...</i>

462
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,504
I kind of miss him.

463
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,047
Why don't you
just be honest with me

464
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,610
and tell me which hand
you're leaning towards?

465
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,457
His.

466
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,692
I'm sorry.

467
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,932
Wow.

468
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:07,035
I'd like to say a few words
about a guy I know,

469
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:09,546
a friend of mine.

470
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,981
His name is Brian Piccolo.

471
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,877
He has a mental attitude

472
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,822
which makes me proud
to have a friend

473
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:22,315
who spells out courage
24 hours a day,

474
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,658
every day of his life.

475
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,630
I can't get
Ari on the phone.

476
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,031
- It says his cell's been disconnected.
- Shut up!

477
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,092
- Move.
- You guys have any idea where Vince

478
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,536
- might have his home number?
- No. Shut up!

479
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,631
- Move!
- Call the agency.

480
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,541
There's got to be
a night answering service.

481
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,875
But I say to you,
here and now,

482
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,472
Brian Piccolo is the man
of courage...

483
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:46,109
Hi, can you put me through
to Ari Gold's voicemail?

484
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,642
Sorry, but I'm afraid
Mr. Gold no longer works here.

485
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,917
Okay, thank you.

486
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,793
I loved Brian Piccolo.

487
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,523
They said he no longer
works there.

488
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,633
Hey, Vince.

489
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,637
Can I get you
to turn off the TV?

490
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,734
Come on, Vince,
it's the best part.

491
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,813
All right, just
to get it over with

492
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,411
so we don't have to talk
about it again.

493
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,081
You guys were right.

494
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,090
It's not over
between them.

495
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,752
And we're done.

496
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,091
- Sorry, buddy.
- Yeah, sorry, Vin.

497
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,154
We're all sorry, bro.

498
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,688
Yeah.

499
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,166
Are you mad at us
for telling you?

500
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,567
No, I love you guys
for telling me.

501
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,298
Anything we can do
for you?

502
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,896
Nah.

503
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,670
Uh, actually,
tell Ari

504
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,836
I'm not gonna
do the movie.

505
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,073
I couldn't work
with her every day.

506
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:52,015
I'm gonna go to bed.

507
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,295
My life is over!

508
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,667
You will bounce back,
Ari Gold.

509
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,365
I drove to work
in an $80,000 Mercedes.

510
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,398
I'm driving home in a prop car
from "The Fast and the Furious."

511
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,842
I just don't see it.

512
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,190
What the hell
am I gonna say to my wife?

513
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,926
Ari...

514
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:42,400
I've worked 18 hours
a day to save up the money

515
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,301
to put myself through
Stanford Business School.

516
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,897
While I was there,
I cleaned the cafeteria

517
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,964
during the hours
I wasn't studying

518
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,442
and still graduated
top of my class,

519
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:54,638
only to take a job
delivering mail

520
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:58,342
to unappreciative
overpaid little cocksuckers,

521
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,214
then to finally get
the big promotion

522
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,412
that would allow me
to answer your phones

523
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,513
and be both racially
and sexually harassed

524
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,854
for the next nine months.

525
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:09,325
But I know the endgame,

526
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,659
and you, Ari Gold,
you are it.

527
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:13,664
So stop your
fucking whining,

528
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:15,825
and go into your gorgeous
$3 million house

529
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,630
with your beautiful
goddess wife

530
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:19,500
and figure out how
you're going to make

531
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:22,028
both of our lives
happen tomorrow!

532
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:27,038
- That was a good speech, Lloyd.
- Pfft.

533
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:29,638
If I was 25 and liked cock,
we could be something.

534
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:32,047
Oi.

535
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,074
We're gonna be okay,
Lloyd.

536
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:40,347
Oh my God.

537
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,018
This is fate.

538
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:13,253
Are you out of your
fucking mind, Ari?

539
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,452
Get in the house, now!

540
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:17,051
Baby.
Baby!

541
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:18,722
- You're drunk?
- Baby!

542
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,560
What happened
to your hand?

543
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:22,361
Dance with me, baby.
Nothing nothing.

544
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,359
I haven't stopped thinking about you.
Baby, you're my everything. Baby baby!

545
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:27,871
Lloyd, what the hell
is wrong with him?

546
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,704
- Baby!
- He is in love is all.

547
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:33,176
Good night!

548
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:37,404
Come on.
Baby, this is our song.

549
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:38,973
You are my life.

550
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,451
I'm not going into that house
until you dance with me.

551
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:43,386
The music's gone,
Ari.

552
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:47,815
That's weird,
but I can still feel it.

553
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,554
Come on.

554
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:51,562
- Ari?
- What? Come on, baby.

555
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:54,190
Feel it in the house,
okay?

556
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:00,036
- Ari! Ow!
- My fucking hand, baby!

557
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,369
Oh!
Ari...

558
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,931
Ari, the neighbors.
