1
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,389
What do you think?
Five-button Dolce too edgy or just right?

2
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,351
You shooting a pilot or serving food?

3
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,994
Don't give me a hard time today,
Turtle, please!

4
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,629
So big day all around.
Everyone excited?

5
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,830
- What are you doing?
- Can't you tell?

6
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,678
- Channelling Joey Ramone.
- Joey didn't play guitar.

7
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,836
That's Johnny,
who I'd be perfect for.

8
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,791
Do a little brother-brother piece.

9
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,432
They weren't really related.

10
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,948
- Like anyone believes they are.
- What the fuck?

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,879
- I told you I got a big day. I don't need this!
- Easy, Drama, I'm just playing!

12
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,309
Play with someone without a monologue.

13
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,237
What's the matter, Johnny? Nervous?

14
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,353
I haven't had a real part in a long time,
and... I got this big monologue to do.

15
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,949
- Maybe you should take a Xanax.
- No Xanax. You can't act on Xanax.

16
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,231
You can't act when you're having
a panic attack either.

17
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,989
Why would you say panic attack?
I haven't had a panic attack since '95.

18
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,749
- I don't need that shit in my head!
- Relax, Drama. You're going to kill it.

19
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,518
You know what I do when I'm anxious?

20
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,710
- No, what?
- I whack off.

21
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,910
Yeah, that's great.
I'm gonna whack off.

22
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,589
I'm serious. Will you trust me?
A good tug takes away all your anxiety.

23
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,598
Yeah, so does a good laugh.
Thanks, man. I'm outta here.

24
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,554
- Knock 'em dead.
- Good luck.

25
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,352
- Thanks, guys.
- I'm gonna roll too.

26
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,313
Heading to Paramount with Bob and Ari.
First meeting. Sure you shouldn't be there?

27
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,636
Ari said don't show.
And I'm taking Turtle shopping.

28
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,956
- For what?
- Kicks they're dropping at Undefeated.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,152
With my Saigon money burning a hole
in my pocket, I may just have to buy them all.

30
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,760
Good investment strategy, Turtle.
See you guys.

31
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,836
- Go get 'em, E.
- This could be a big one.

32
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,152
Ah, the Boy Wonder.

33
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,077
- Can you smell it?
- Smell what?

34
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,269
Napalm.

35
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,869
Love the smell of napalm in the morning.
It smells like victory.

36
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,276
- Glad you're confident. Where's Bob?
- You were gonna call him.

37
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,389
You said you were.

38
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,317
- I did?
- Yeah, you did.

39
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,112
But you didn't, which is why I did.

40
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,799
Eric, you did not.
Tell me you did not call Bob.

41
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,550
We have enough problems with the studio.

42
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,398
I don't need this old fuck
keeling over in the middle.

43
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,874
- It's his project.
- So he doesn't need to be here.

44
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,911
- What?
- He's protected.

45
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,872
We get him wet with Vince,
I guarantee they will fuck us.

46
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,037
Blow our load with Bob,
we might not get our balls tickled.

47
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,471
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about,
but you're making me uncomfortable.

48
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,757
Did he mug Liberace
on the way over here?

49
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,995
- Be nice.
- Hey, Bob.

50
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,156
Did you try to screw me
out of this meeting?

51
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,668
Are you kidding?
Simple miscommunication.

52
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,870
- Let's not have another one.
- I promise.

53
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,276
- Remember who found this project.
- And where. Under your pillow.

54
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,630
Without me, they wouldn't have uncovered it
until your estate sale.

55
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,355
This thing is hot. I can feel it.
I'm looking forward to this meeting.

56
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,709
- Me too, Bob.
- Think Dawnie will be there?

57
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,159
Dawnie who?

58
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,398
- Dawn Steele, the head of the studio.
- Bob, Dawn Steele died nine years ago.

59
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,510
Oh, my God, you're right.

60
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,199
I went to her funeral.

61
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,553
Jeez...

62
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,229
All these people are in line for sneakers?

63
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,430
Yeah. Some of them camped out all night.

64
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,789
- For sneakers?
- These ain't just sneakers.

65
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,310
- These are limited edition Fukijamas.
- Fuki-what-as?

66
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,352
Vince. You know sometimes
you're so cultureless.

67
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,915
Fukijama is one of the most
famous graffiti artists in the world.

68
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,110
Every year Nike commissions him
to do a drop.

69
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,154
200 pairs this year. After that, he destroys
the pattern and they're never made again.

70
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,237
- So they're holding a pair for you?
- Nah, they refused.

71
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,432
But it's an unwritten law in America.
Bring a movie star, go to the front of the line.

72
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,199
Are you nuts?
These people will kill us if we cut.

73
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,357
- They'll be thrilled to get a glimpse.
- I'm not cutting.

74
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,550
Way to be a man of the people, Aquaman.

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,114
- These are limited...
- Back of the line.

76
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,549
You're lucky I'm even willing to wait.

77
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,513
Hi, I'm Johnny Chase. Where do I check in?

78
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,073
Let me see.
We got you...

79
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,953
- Drama!
- Jesus, Ed!

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,833
- You OK?
- Yeah, you just startled me a bit.

81
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,359
Cool, cool. Good to see you.

82
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,279
Jesus, your hands feel like you just got out
of the lap pool. A little nervous?

83
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,073
Nervous? Me?
No, no, I'm not nervous. I feel great.

84
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,194
You're gonna feel even greater in a second
because I just beefed up your monologue.

85
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,232
- You added to my monologue?
- Just a couple of paragraphs.

86
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,556
Just think.
Three minutes, your face, and a lens.

87
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,434
- Every actor's fantasy, right?
- Great. Great.

88
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,989
- I'm a little nervous.
- It's all good, Bob. Just relax.

89
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,271
It's been a long time since I had
a meeting with so much on the line.

90
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,434
- So what are you thinking for strategy, Ari?
- I'm thinking that I talk and you guys listen.

91
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,040
Well, I'm a little more
personable than you are.

92
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,473
What if I lead things off with a joke or a trick?
I brought a deck of cards.

93
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,353
You brought cards.
He brought cards.

94
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,039
- I don't think we need cards, Bob.
- Nah.

95
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,992
I'm not comfortable just not talking,
so what then?

96
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,349
Why don't you play solitaire?

97
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,073
You know what?
I don't like your attitude.

98
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,792
- Gentlemen.
- There he is.

99
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,114
How are you, Brad?

100
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,995
Bradley! Bob Ryan. Nice to meet you.
I'm the producer, in case you had to guess.

101
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,156
Of course, yeah. It's a pleasure.
Come in.

102
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,476
- You need anything to drink? Anything?
- I'd love a cup of Sanka.

103
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,556
Sanka? Get him a Sanka.

104
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,115
I hope you brought your chequebook,
you're gonna want to buy this one in the room.

105
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,798
Great, tell me about it.

106
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,910
- How do I get there?
- Where?

107
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,598
- I want to get there.
- Have a seat.

108
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,790
Let him through, Ari, Jesus!

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,831
OK, fellas, let's get going here.

110
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,633
- We're excited about this.
- What if I was to tell you

111
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,750
that you could make this for nothing,

112
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,109
win an Oscar,
and gross $100 million?

113
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,355
Is that something you'd be interested in?

114
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,312
I think I would, Bob.

115
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,278
- Thanks.
- Hey, thanks, homes.

116
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,834
- No problem, man.
- Vince Chase, over here!

117
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,233
Come on. You got enough.

118
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,430
- Just a couple more.
- Hey, guys, thanks.

119
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,836
- Thanks for your patience.
- We got no shot here, Vin, no shot.

120
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,030
Don't worry. I'm feeling good about it.

121
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,039
Yo, Turtle, check it out, man.
Last set of 9s.

122
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,469
I'm a 10, dickhead.

123
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,750
Little-ass feet. Still feeling good?

124
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,358
Yeah, I am. But I don't get it.

125
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,870
If this was so important,
why didn't you get up and stand on line?

126
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,993
Cos I had you. You're a "roll out of bed late
and still get the kicks" card.

127
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,315
If you stop the negativity,
I will get them.

128
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,510
- How?
- Will you stop with the negativity?

129
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,551
- Yes.
- Then I will get them.

130
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,398
Yo, listen up! The Fuks are done.
We're sold out.

131
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,158
- How, Vince, how?
- I'm calling Tracy at Nike.

132
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,590
She's got nothing to do with this.
These are limited.

133
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,189
- The only way was if we cut the fucking line!
- All right, I get it.

134
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,753
Yo, Santa Monica has a few pairs left.
Better hurry.

135
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,315
- Come on, Turtle, let's hit it.
- You want to race all these people?

136
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,794
If we have to.
We are getting you the sneakers.

137
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,910
I love the positivity, but it won't happen.

138
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,238
- All right. You know what? Let's not even try.
- Fuck that. We're definitely trying.

139
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,032
You are not a pussy.
You are not a pussy.

140
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,836
We're ready for you.

141
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,235
And I'm ready for you, baby.

142
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,112
There he is!

143
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,552
I'm gonna kill this, man.

144
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,194
I want to talk to you
about the blocking, though.

145
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,550
What blocking? The script says
I'm sitting at a table.

146
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,275
I came up with a great shot.
We're gonna do the whole thing on the move.

147
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,515
I'm doing my monologue on the move?

148
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,030
Just like life, walking and talking.
It's gonna be beautiful.

149
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,308
It's a long speech.

150
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,115
The guys at the network don't think we can
do it but I told them we got the guy that can.

151
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,318
Johnny, where are you going?

152
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,590
I left the iron on in my trailer.

153
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,278
You are not a pussy.

154
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,954
- I think that went very well.
- Very well? You lost him at Sanka.

155
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,117
The man said, and I'm quoting,
"This is not for us."

156
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,752
They didn't want a biopic.

157
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,268
I have never been turned down
in the room before.

158
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,598
It didn't sound like a turn-down to me. It
sounded like he needed to hear a little more.

159
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,235
He couldn't hear anything
because you wouldn't stop talking.

160
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,748
What did you expect?
You had no plan.

161
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,030
I had a plan for you to shut the fuck up.

162
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,878
- I don't like how he's speaking.
- Don't speak like that.

163
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,469
If I told you I had a 22-inch cock,
is it something you'd be interested in?

164
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,636
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Are you mocking?

165
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,070
Why would I? Everyone knows the best way
to close a deal

166
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,111
is to pull a quarter out of the president's ear.

167
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,720
Ari, it's no one's fault.
It just wasn't for them.

168
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,035
E, they have no idea
what's for them.

169
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,310
That's what I do. I sell.

170
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,635
It's not your project to sell, Ari.

171
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,196
Vince is my client. Without Vince, it's just
chopped up trees with words on them.

172
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,676
You sanctimonious piece of crap,
I put years into this script.

173
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,029
- Relax.
- It's my score and he denigrates.

174
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,789
He has no respect.
I have 50 years in this business!

175
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,197
Time was when I'd walk into the Derby they'd
kick Coppola out on his ass to get me a table!

176
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,438
- Time was there was no sound in movies, Bob.
- Ari, let me handle this.

177
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,792
I hear you, and I promise you're going to get
everything you want when we set this up.

178
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,231
But Ari does this every day, so what do you
say on the next one we let him do his thing?

179
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,319
OK. But for you, because
you're a nice boy with kind eyes.

180
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,555
Thanks, Bob.

181
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,352
OK, Ari, it's your show.

182
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,472
You call the plays
and I'll provide the colour.

183
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,750
No. No fucking colour.
Tell him no colour, E.

184
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,076
Let's skip the colour. If things go badly,
then maybe you step in.

185
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,112
OK, I'll step in
when it's appropriate.

186
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,312
- So where to next?
- Disney. Remember Disney, Bob?

187
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,920
- Yes, I remember.
- Big ears, little mouse?

188
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:24,432
I screen tested Cybill Shepherd there.
Tons of talent, no underpants.

189
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,393
How about that? E, roll with me,
we'll save some gas. I'll drop you off.

190
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,431
OK. You want to roll with us, Bob?

191
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,270
- In that Nazi sled? I don't think so.
- All right, well, I'll see you over there.

192
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,677
Ah, good. It's ringing. Finally.

193
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,871
Don't matter. They won't hold 'em,
even for celebs.

194
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,995
I'm just telling you how the system works.

195
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,198
Undefeated, Santa Monica.

196
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,800
Hi, how are you?
I'm Vince Chase. I'm an actor.

197
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,319
You mean Aquaman?

198
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,032
- Yeah.
- Wow, what's up?

199
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,436
Well, I'm kind of desperate
for a size 10 pair of the Fukiyamas.

200
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,596
Fukijamas, Vince. Fukijamas.

201
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,790
He knows what I'm talking about.

202
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,956
- I've only got one 11.
- You want 'em?

203
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,116
- Is he gonna hold 'em?
- Do you want 'em?

204
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,549
If he holds 'em
I'll wear three pairs of socks!

205
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,319
I'm on my way down there.
Will you hold them for me?

206
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,514
Actually, I'd love to, but we're not allowed
to hold these for anyone, even celebrities.

207
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,676
It would really mean a lot to me.

208
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,949
I knew they wouldn't hold them.

209
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,877
- $1500 cash in your pocket when I arrive.
- There you go.

210
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,150
Vince, I can't take your money, man.

211
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,670
But if this is really you, my sister, man,
she's a huge fan of yours.

212
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,032
If you were to show up at her birthday party,
take a few pictures with her friends,

213
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,311
it would be like you were family.
I could never say no to family.

214
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,351
- These shoes are cool?
- The coolest.

215
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,118
Fine, you got a deal.

216
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,914
Nice! But you still gotta hurry,
cos if people find these hidden back here,

217
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,236
- they're gonna tear me alive.
- All right, thanks.

218
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,670
- We in?
- Say I have juice. Go ahead, come on.

219
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,154
- Say it.
- You have juice, Vince.

220
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,430
All right, good, hurry up.
Santa Monica.

221
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,119
We're doing 75 on Olympic.
What do you want me to do?

222
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,910
- I thought we were going to Disney.
- No, Universal.

223
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,598
You told Bob Disney, Ari.

224
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,358
Did I?

225
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,312
What are you, fucking eight years old? Unreal.

226
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,157
Ari Gold to see Jacqueline Stone.

227
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,792
- There you go.
- Thank you.

228
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,868
- Sir, what's that name again?
- Ryan, Bob Ryan. R-Y-A-N.

229
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,436
- I'm here to see the president of the studio.
- I don't have a drive-on for a Bob Ryan.

230
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,631
You can use the phone over there
and call the president's office.

231
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,798
Who's the president again?

232
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,799
He's not answering, Ari.

233
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,276
He can't hear it. Why don't you get
a direct line to his hearing aid?

234
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,833
I'm not going in without him.

235
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,677
- Be reasonable, E.
- Blow me.

236
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,472
That's not very nice.

237
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,272
Jacqueline's ready for you.

238
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,312
We're waiting for a third.
Can we push it back a few minutes?

239
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,069
I can ask,
but she leaves for New York in 25 minutes.

240
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,839
- Let's go, E.
- Fine.

241
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,950
To put your phone on vibrate
for your first meeting, press one!

242
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,992
Ari, what a pleasure.

243
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,837
- Sorry.
- Come right on in.

244
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,235
- Hi, how are you?
- It's nice to meet you.

245
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,836
Yo, Drama, let's go, bro.

246
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,869
Dude, you in there?

247
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,558
You are not a pussy.

248
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,390
Yo, Drama, what the fuck, man?

249
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,072
You are a pussy.

250
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,508
Look at you.
You make me sick. Suck it up, you little bitch!

251
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,836
Yo, Drama! You're murdering
my whole fucking day here.

252
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,110
What are you gonna do?

253
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,680
Jesus fuckin'...

254
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,188
Two minutes, Eddie,
and I'll be all good.

255
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,955
Does anybody know
what he's doing in there?

256
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,877
I do.

257
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,751
His mic's still on.

258
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,519
Oh, yeah... Oh, baby...

259
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,355
Jesus Christ. Beano, you gotta hear this.

260
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,756
Forget about it.
He's rubbing one out. Unbelievable.

261
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,830
Oh, yeah, look at you...

262
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,029
- Fuck!
- What?

263
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,150
- I think that's DJ AM's car.
- So?

264
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,952
- Sneakerhead, size 11. Not good.

265
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,991
Just chill.

266
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,629
Tell me you're going a size up nowadays, AM.

267
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,672
No dice, Turtle. Sorry, man.
What's up, Vince?

268
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,392
Trying to get my boy some sneaks.
What's up?

269
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,989
I was doing better before you negotiated.
Know what I had to do to get these?

270
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,919
Not only do I have to spin this kid's
birthday party, I gotta have it in my club.

271
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,589
Look, Turtle's desperate for those shoes.
Anything I can do?

272
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,791
Sorry. No dice.
I've been waiting on these since Christmas.

273
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,991
- I knew about them in November.
- You got me there.

274
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,712
But I got these. Later, Vince.

275
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,751
Late.

276
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,789
Come on, man.

277
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,752
Sorry. I didn't actually
think that was you on the phone.

278
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,872
Besides, that cat's gonna pay
for my sister's party.

279
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,956
That's more important than your word?

280
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,151
Come on, homey, you know how it is
in this crazy world of ours.

281
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,590
- No rules apply.
- What a nightmare.

282
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,232
Come on, let's go.

283
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,431
I'm sorry. Come on, I'm sorry.
I hate it when you're mad at me.

284
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,040
First I lose my rapper,
then I lose my limiteds.

285
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,753
I'm not mad, Vin, I'm just sad.

286
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,518
I'm really, really sad.

287
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,152
Did I tell you or did I tell you?
I'm like motherfucking Caesar.

288
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,351
- I came, I saw, I conquered!
- I admit you were fucking awesome.

289
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,595
- Did I take care of Bob?
- Call and tell him.

290
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,074
I'm going to get a bidding war started.

291
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,999
- Paramount passed.
- Before they found out Universal didn't pass.

292
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,759
It's like high school.
You can't fuck the prom queen

293
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,873
till she finds out her best friend
jerked you off under the bleachers.

294
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,992
No answer. He must be miserable.

295
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,430
The more miserable he is, the bigger
the upswing when he gets the news.

296
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,198
That's great, Ari.

297
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,232
Nobody went up there
and told you nothing.

298
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,759
It's not the same any more.

299
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:05,318
It's different now. It's not just happening over
there, not just over there. It's happening here.

300
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,952
It's happening everywhere.

301
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,436
All three of them went, boom-boom-boom,
one after the next.

302
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,038
He's good.

303
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,959
I'm not just gonna stand around
and let that happen to nobody,

304
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,560
not in my town.

305
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,795
Not in any of my five towns.

306
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,433
Johnny, that was perfect.

307
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,952
That was great. Guys, keep rolling, zoom in.
Want to grab a couple of reaction shots.

308
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,069
Reaction shots?

309
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,396
Yeah, can you give me one
where you're... you're angry?

310
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,670
OK, angry.

311
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,278
All right.

312
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,558
Nice. Let's get one
where you're just like a little bit sad.

313
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,874
Sad?

314
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,593
All right, good, good.
Let's do one more where, um...

315
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,915
you're kind of a little bit embarrassed.

316
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,791
Embarrassed?

317
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,390
Why would I be embarrassed?

318
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,638
You poured your heart and soul out
to this guy. You don't know if he was listening.

319
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,398
You don't know if he gives a shit.

320
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,638
I don't know that I'm feeling
embarrassed about that.

321
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,199
When you went to your trailer? You had your
mic on when you were whackin' it.

322
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,549
All right? The entire crew heard you.

323
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,192
Got it. Great.
Guys, that's a wrap. Johnny, great job.

324
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,349
The guy's a genius. He'll do whatever
he's got to do to get it on film.

325
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,073
You were right. Your method works.

326
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,554
Next time anxiety rears its ugly head,

327
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,910
- I'm just gonna beat it back down.
- Glad you had a great day.

328
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,359
- Thanks.
- Mine sucked.

329
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,277
I don't care how much it costs.

330
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,038
OK, cool. Bye.

331
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,793
- Who are you whispering sweet nothings to?
- Start filling out your W-2.

332
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,273
You're going to work.

333
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,834
Universal's in.
Paramount have to match it or better.

334
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,917
- I'm gonna be Joey Ramone?
- It's a question of for how much.

335
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,316
- Nice! Good work!
- Glad to see you all had good days.

336
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,078
He didn't get his sneakers.

337
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,953
But I got him the best weed
in LA to make up for it.

338
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,116
I don't want to smoke. It'll make me cry.

339
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,152
- Come on. Let's go.
- All right.

340
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,760
- So is Bob excited?
- That's a whole other story.

341
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,599
- Totally uncool of Ari.
- And Bob won't call me back.

342
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,872
Hey, guys, I feel bad for Bob and all,
but I've got my own career going on finally.

343
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,198
- Yeah, and?
- I'm concerned about where the fuck we are.

344
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,471
Relax, we're cool.
Turtle, pull over here.

345
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,315
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Christ.

346
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,035
All right, Turtle.
Go ask for Jimmy and give him this.

347
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,548
- What is it?
- Emergency fund. Go.

348
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,192
- No one's with me?
- Nope.

349
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,196
What's going on?
I feel like Sonny Corleone at the toll booth.

350
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,595
Have I ever put you in harm's way?

351
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,198
- No.
- Then go, Turtle, go.

352
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,631
'Sup, fellas?

353
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,557
- Is Jimmy around?
- He's inside.

354
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,431
Inside? All right.

355
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,912
I'll walk you in.

356
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,832
- You Turtle?
- Yeah, you Jimmy?

357
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,998
I hear you like my sneakers.

358
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,713
Holy shit! Wait, you're Fukijama?

359
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,275
- You don't live in Japan?
- Born and raised in Glendale, my man.

360
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,594
I'm sorry the new kicks went so quick,
but I made you an even more limited edition.

361
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,757
Only one... of one.

362
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,948
Holy...

363
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,672
Can I...

364
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,233
- 5,000?
- A little bit more.

365
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,511
- For sneakers?
- 5,250.

366
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,030
- A little bit more.
- Jesus. For sneakers? You need mental help.

367
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,753
They're not just sneakers.
They're wearable art.

368
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,997
Besides, the joy that Turtle's feeling
is worth every penny.

369
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,792
5,500.

370
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,829
A little bit more.

371
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,108
Christ.

372
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,628
- Yeah, Ari?
- E, I have Ari and Bob for you.

373
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,990
Ari, here's E and Bob.
Bob, you have E and Ari.

374
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,792
Shut the fuck up.
Bob, you there?

375
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,274
- We got great news.
- You're all taken care of.

376
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,835
Oh, you bet I am, Ari,
because nobody fucks Bob but Bob.

377
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,235
Ari is so sorry. Ari, tell him.

378
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,238
- I am sorry, Bob.
- And you got everything you wanted.

379
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,716
You're right, Eric, I did,
cos after I got tossed off the Disney lot

380
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,992
I went around the block to see my friend
Alan at Warner's.

381
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,031
Man, does he hate young Vincent.

382
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,551
- Tell me you didn't do something stupid.
- Stupid, Ari? What if I was to tell you

383
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,319
that I sold the picture to my friend Alan?

384
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,430
Is that something you'd be interested in?

385
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,948
- Bob, let's talk about this.
- Hold on. Bob?

386
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,797
I've talked enough.

387
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,232
Bob, let's talk about this.

388
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,236
Lloyd! Get Bob back!

389
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,632
What's going on?

390
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,673
Bob just sold the project to Warner's.

391
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,311
- That's not good.
- No, it's not.

392
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,358
You ready?

393
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,078
How sweet are these?

394
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,189
What's going on?

395
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,755
Nothing, I just spent 20 grand
on sneakers and I don't have a job.

396
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,949
English
