1
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,158
Hey, it's me!

2
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,626
Yep. We just landed.

3
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,526
Okay. Cool.

4
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,190
The guy's not home
five seconds,

5
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,791
- he's already calling Kristen.
- Oh boy, here we go.

6
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,132
You don't want her thinking
you're dying to see her, do you?

7
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,433
Turtle's right, E.
Let her think you're busy.

8
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,803
She's my girlfriend,
idiots.

9
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,364
I don't care
what she thinks.

10
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,706
I don't have to play games anymore.
Tell them, Vince.

11
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:52,904
Come on, what do I know
about relationships?

12
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,972
What kind of girlfriend won't come
see you while you're away working?

13
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,539
The kind of girlfriend
in school.

14
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,018
I went to school.
How hard is it to cut out on that shit?

15
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,453
Not that hard
when you're headed for a G.E.D.

16
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,753
Three months without pussy, E.
That's rough.

17
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,418
You're almost
a virgin again.

18
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,585
Why do you think
he's calling?

19
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,720
It's like the guy
got his hymen restored.

20
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,889
Vince, you ever go
three months without pussy?

21
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,764
- Vince ain't never gone three days...
- Wait, that's not true.

22
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,598
Sophomore year.

23
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,661
- Really?
- Well, you had mono.

24
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:21,731
- Good memory, E.
- That shit don't count.

25
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:24,265
Yo, Johnny, is there
another slice left?

26
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,675
No, sorry, bro.

27
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,373
Polished it off
over the Grand Canyon.

28
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,041
We need an Eddie's out here.
L.A. Pizza blows.

29
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,984
Why is it so hard
to get a good slice in L.A. Anyway?

30
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,419
Tap water. That's why you can't
get a decent bagel either.

31
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,116
Except on Fairfax.

32
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,455
There's different water
on Fairfax?

33
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,655
Yeah, Vince.
The Jews import it from Borough Park.

34
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,890
I'm serious.

35
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:48,162
If that were the case, then why can't you
get a good slice on Fairfax?

36
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,396
Because Jews don't
make pizza, idiot.

37
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,461
So, given your theory,
Drama,

38
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,666
I should get a decent pizza bagel
at Canter's.

39
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,265
- Uh-huh.
- Wrong, E.

40
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,368
Kosher mozzarella
tastes like tofu.

41
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,470
Tofu?

42
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,608
Did you call for a car,
Turtle?

43
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,140
Was I supposed to?

44
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,777
No, we're supposed
to walk home.

45
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:10,016
Summer break's over, E.
Time to get your soldiers in line.

46
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:13,082
Guy's not my soldier.
I inherited him.

47
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,754
- Hey, fuck you.
- I hate the new system.

48
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,786
Check it out.

49
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,799
You called them
and asked them not to tow it?

50
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:24,291
It would be cooler if I left it
for Homeland Security to impound.

51
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,304
Shotgun!

52
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,169
I hate
the new system.

53
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,672
All right,
so, remember...

54
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:40,413
gardener, pool guy,
newspaper, vet, alarm company,

55
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,683
satellite, Gelson's,
dry cleaning,

56
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,883
and get the MLB package
hooked up.

57
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,391
Oh, call your boy Busey,
Vince.

58
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,053
We're finally gonna
accept that gift.

59
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,857
I hope it's not
a self-portrait.

60
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,955
Turtle, will you do me a favor?
Will you take this stuff in?

61
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,592
Vince, I want his job.
The guy's sitting on Easy Street.

62
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,761
Turtle, please.
You're like a three-time Lotto winner.

63
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:57,667
Where you going?

64
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,104
Three months, Vince.
Three months.

65
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,606
Yeah, you won't last
five minutes.

66
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,131
He won't last
five seconds.

67
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,940
What are you doing?

68
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,413
You got me thinking.
Take me to Stacy's.

69
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,246
No, Jamie's.
No, Stacy's.

70
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,343
What?

71
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,013
What the fuck
are we supposed to do?

72
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,181
Jerk each other off,
you losers!

73
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,214
Yeah, don't forget
your bag!

74
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,789
- Help me with this stuff?
- Yeah.

75
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,890
I got Arnold.
Come on, Arnold, let's go.

76
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,511
Huh-uh! Huh-uh!
Huh-uh!

77
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:40,842
What?

78
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,973
I have my period.

79
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,507
Oh, fuck.
Really?

80
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,486
Yeah.
Bad timing, huh?

81
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,011
Yeah.

82
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,619
Uh, you know.
I mean...

83
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,596
- Maybe, uh...
- What?

84
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,294
It's been three months.

85
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,632
Maybe
a little something else.

86
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,967
No.

87
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,767
- Why?
- Because...

88
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,467
that wouldn't be fair
to me.

89
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:12,467
I've been waiting to have sex with you
for three months also.

90
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,309
Yeah, but it's easier
for girls to hold out.

91
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,076
No. Eric.

92
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,583
I feel gross.

93
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,245
I feel fat and bloated.

94
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,686
Well, you're not.
You're beautiful.

95
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,451
- Saturday night.
- What?

96
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,153
We can get really drunk.

97
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:31,163
And since you're
this big hotshot manager

98
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:35,065
making the big bucks, we can get
a room at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

99
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,661
Big bucks?
I made $6,000 on that movie.

100
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,604
Okay, well,
we'll split the room.

101
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,903
We'll have the best sex ever.

102
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,205
What are we gonna do now?

103
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,575
Just kiss.

104
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,513
- She wouldn't even blow you?
- Or give you a nice tug?

105
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,039
That's bullshit.

106
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,551
You act like a priest
for three months,

107
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,177
the least the girl
can do is service you.

108
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,847
That is
a little selfish.

109
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:58,482
Had I shown up and Kristen
was missing a leg,

110
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,617
I still would have
taken care of business.

111
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,687
You would have sex
with a girl on her period?

112
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,358
Who wouldn't, man?

113
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,994
Hey, I've done it.
It's not something I hope for.

114
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,300
You guys are disgusting.
I don't think I've ever done that.

115
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,862
Well, you should,
altar boy.

116
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,602
Because it's a fact
a girl on her period is hornier.

117
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,337
And there's no need
for a raincoat.

118
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,711
- It's like Flag Day.
- Except it's a week. Hold that!

119
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,642
Hey, what's up?

120
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,721
What the fuck?

121
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,660
Hey, guys.
I'm Lloyd, Ari's new assistant.

122
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,185
What's up, man?
I'm Vince.

123
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,289
I know who you are.

124
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,129
If Ari gives you a hard time
let me know, all right?

125
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,465
What happened to Emily?

126
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,630
I don't know.
Can I get you something to drink?

127
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,799
- Water.
- Water sounds good.

128
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,105
I'm good.

129
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,375
- What are you being an asshole for?
- Yeah?

130
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,577
A bigwig like Ari should have
a hot assistant to look at.

131
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,949
Johnny, some people
probably think he is hot.

132
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,715
I ain't one
of them people.

133
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,221
Come on, Turtle,
let's go.

134
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,986
The only reason we stopped
was to see how Emily treated you.

135
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:06,992
Peace.

136
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,789
The boys are back
in town!

137
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,557
You like "Gaysian Lloyd"?

138
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,326
He's cute, right?
And he covers two quotas.

139
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,391
- Did you fire Emily?
- I had to.

140
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,336
To make sure you wouldn't
fuck another one of my assistants.

141
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,100
You're not gonna try
to fuck Lloyd?

142
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,629
Did you really fire her?

143
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,234
James Cameron stole her.
She's over at Lightstorm.

144
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,245
So, how was
the little movie?

145
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,803
Ah, honestly...

146
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,747
one of the best
experiences of my life.

147
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,410
That's fantastic. But you got it
out of your system, right?

148
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,477
I wanted to talk
to you about that.

149
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,813
I ran into Neil Labute
in New York.

150
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,825
He wants me
to do his play in London.

151
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,327
Six months,
$300 a week.

152
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:45,819
But I figure with your negotiating skills you
can get me $400.

153
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,457
And it's very well written.

154
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,695
Okay, Ari, I'm joking.

155
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,260
I'm ready to work.
What do you got?

156
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,636
Hiya, Mary.

157
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,347
Hi, I'm Carla.

158
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,614
Adam's new assistant.

159
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,779
Can I get you guys
something to drink?

160
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:13,849
You have a "Diet Creamsicle Shasta"
by any chance?

161
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,157
Johnny, Turtle.

162
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,058
Adam!

163
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,966
You have an office!

164
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:25,596
And you've got
a smoking-hot assistant.

165
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,765
Yep, and it's all
because of this guy.

166
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,071
- Really?
- No, not really.

167
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,576
Sit. Sit.

168
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,215
So, I'm back
and I'm ready.

169
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,242
Great!
Exciting stuff going on.

170
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,254
- Yeah?
- I'm circling something at NBC.

171
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,153
TV?

172
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,421
I thought maybe after "Queens Boulevard"
we could get a movie.

173
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,327
Oh, this is a movie.
A movie of the week.

174
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,524
But I have
a little problem.

175
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,590
Your headshots...

176
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,931
they're setting us back.

177
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,061
I've had those shots
since '92.

178
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,969
They've been great.
What's the problem?

179
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,133
The problem is people
get annoyed

180
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,574
when they expect to see
a 24-year-old.

181
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,110
Does this look
like you?

182
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,609
- You ready?
- Let's go, we're ready.

183
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:15,916
This kid's got
no patience.

184
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,923
In some countries,
they would cut off your elfin feet

185
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,254
for disrupting
the master's flow.

186
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,919
How about I shove
my elfin foot up your ass?

187
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,928
- You missed me, didn't you?
- Ari, come on.

188
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,987
All right, you ready?

189
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,022
"Aquaman"!

190
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,994
- "Aquaman"?
- "Aquaman," baby!

191
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,835
It is "Spiderman" underwater!
Boom.

192
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,966
- Is there a script?
- No, I know he doesn't like to read,

193
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,568
so I got you something
with pictures.

194
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,013
Tell him, E.

195
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,914
Uh-oh, tell me what?

196
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,578
We know what we want
to do next.

197
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,951
What?
The fucking Belt Parkway?

198
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,548
- Relax. It's a studio movie.
- Really?

199
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,149
It's big.

200
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,523
Show him.

201
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,960
What is this, some Showtime miniseries?
Come on.

202
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:02,365
No, it's "Medellin."
The Pablo Escobar story.

203
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,562
Sex, drugs
and salsa!

204
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,094
Did you read it?

205
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,935
I know about it.
It's at Universal.

206
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,465
This movie is gonna be
the new "Scarface."

207
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,477
Which was our favorite movie
growing up.

208
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:15,309
- Really?
- "Here's the story.

209
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:20,212
I come from the gutter,
that's okay.

210
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,844
I got no education,
I know that.

211
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,412
There will be
no stopping me.

212
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,448
I go straight
to the top, Ari!"

213
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:32,025
This is the kind of studio movie
we want to do.

214
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,430
- "What're you gonna do about it"?
- I'll get into it.

215
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,900
But I'm also deep
into "Aquaman."

216
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,425
I got a meeting
with Dana Gordon.

217
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,870
Well, should I be there?

218
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,167
Uh, no.

219
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,368
Unless you wanna
pull up her car

220
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,843
- or serve us creme brulee.
- Go fuck yourself.

221
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,176
- Not gonna work this year.
- What're you talking about?

222
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,341
- What did I tell you?
- I can't play with the guy?

223
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,078
What's the deal?
We gotta battle.

224
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,712
- Go easy. He's having a rough day.
- What happened?

225
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,813
- He's not getting any.
- Oh, no. You kidding me?

226
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,414
You want me
to get Lloyd in here

227
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,085
and have him hari-kari you
with his pecker? Or no?

228
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:04,119
No? I thought the girlfriend
was still in play.

229
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,393
Bad time of the month
to come home.

230
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,400
- You're like me.
- Yeah? How so?

231
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,198
I won't even fuck my wife
after she plays tennis.

232
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,068
Listen,
here's the deal.

233
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,369
I got other things
to discuss with Dana Gordon.

234
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,000
So you set
your own meetings.

235
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,273
But, Vinnie,
the good news is,

236
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,609
Warner's loves you.
Know it.

237
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:24,707
This year you're going to jump
to the next level, baby.

238
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,615
- Sounds good.
- Sounds fine.

239
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:29,280
I'd say hug it out,
but I don't want you drawing wood.

240
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,686
All right?

241
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,157
This is your year, baby.
Your year!

242
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,090
Jesus.

243
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,402
Try this side.

244
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,180
Turtle! Turtle!

245
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,681
What the fuck
you screaming about?

246
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,944
- I'm right here.
- What's going on?

247
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,644
Everything.
Just like you asked.

248
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:02,119
It's fucking chaos out there.

249
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,451
You couldn't
spread things out?

250
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,457
I have my system,
you had yours.

251
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,686
What is this thing out here
on the front lawn?

252
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,560
That's Busey's gift.
It's "a psychedelic totem pole."

253
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,530
I thought he was giving us
a painting.

254
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,123
I told him I liked
that one better.

255
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,100
We don't own this house. What are we
gonna do with it when we move?

256
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,966
Fucking leave it.
It's ugly as shit.

257
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,233
I told him Vince would take
a picture in front of it, though.

258
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,638
Now you're pissing me off.

259
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,870
Maybe you should
try doing my dog shit job

260
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,810
and I should
try being Vince's manager.

261
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,007
- I did your job.
- Not like this.

262
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,606
Vince never yelled at you.

263
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,776
You yell at a guy,
you break his spirit.

264
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,752
- Ah.
- Vince, does his new title

265
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,618
allow him to yell at me
all the time?

266
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:37,952
That was in his deal.
Sorry.

267
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,287
Don't be so sensitive,
Turtle.

268
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,555
- What day is she on, E?
- Who?

269
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,084
Kristen... what day
of her period is it?

270
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,323
Day two.

271
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,024
You're in
for a rough week.

272
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,693
- Not as rough as E.
- Can I buy you a blow job?

273
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:49,962
It would make
both our lives easier.

274
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,663
Nope, I'm fine.
Don't need any of that.

275
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,331
Just gotta make it
to Saturday night.

276
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,999
What?
You made a sex date?

277
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,008
He's got to wine and dine
his own girlfriend?

278
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,977
I thought the whole reason people have
girlfriends is for effort-free sex.

279
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:02,071
Are you sure she's not trying
to avoid fucking you?

280
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,878
Exactly. Whoever heard of a girl
who cycles mid-month?

281
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,249
- Mm-hmm.
- When do you cycle, Drama?

282
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,277
Hey, Turtle, let's go outside
and take a couple shots.

283
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,152
I already took care
of your head shots.

284
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,624
You can't let Turtle
take your headshots.

285
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:16,184
- Why not?
- Because you need a professional.

286
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,287
You want me to call David LaChapelle?
He owes me a favor.

287
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,730
The guy charges five grand
to set up a light.

288
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:24,532
- I already took care of this, Drama.
- So, I'll pay. It's your career.

289
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,299
You can't
fuck around with it.

290
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,398
It's emasculating having
your kid brother pay for your headshots.

291
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,932
And him paying for the rest of your life
is empowering?

292
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,104
Vince don't pay for shit
of mine.

293
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,307
Everything's on my tab.
Tell him, bro.

294
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:39,476
It's all a loan, okay?
So borrow the money.

295
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:40,985
It's not the money.

296
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,545
It's the principle.
I can't let them win.

297
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,750
- Who's "them"?
- The conspirators in this town

298
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,486
who force the good actors
out of the business

299
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:50,825
by draining their resources
with shit they don't need,

300
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,421
like... fucking headshots.

301
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,227
Your headshots
are taken care of.

302
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:55,824
If someone would
just listen to me.

303
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,268
- By who?
- Trust me, all right?

304
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,929
See, I'm a multi-tasker.

305
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,203
You're a regular Martha Stewart,
Turtle.

306
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,972
At any point am I gonna
get any credit from anyone?

307
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,945
We'll see, Turtle.
We'll see.

308
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,108
"California Pizza Kitchen"?

309
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,641
- Did you buy this?
- Yeah, it's New York style.

310
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,519
Not with guacamole on it,
it's not.

311
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:19,217
You guys are all over me today.
Jesus.

312
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,624
Oh, come on,
don't be so sensitive.

313
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,026
I'll eat the shitty pizza!

314
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,497
Vince, you should take a look
at this "Aquaman."

315
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,829
It's cool
for a comic book.

316
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,459
I don't want
to do "Aquaman."

317
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,765
Afraid you don't got
the body to fill out the suit?

318
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,773
I didn't want to tell Ari,
get the hard sell.

319
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,139
- Will you tell him?
- Sure, I'll lock him into "Medellin."

320
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,575
Gracias, chico.

321
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,988
Excuse me,
was anyone gonna call me

322
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,050
- and tell me you're back?
- You didn't know we were back?

323
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,153
I knew you were back
because Gary Busey told me.

324
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,561
He wants that shot
with Vince.

325
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,428
- Eric Murphy, this is Amanda Peet.
- Hey.

326
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:03,196
- Hey.
- Eric is Vincent Chase's manager.

327
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,169
- Oh, hey.
- Nice to meet you.

328
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,035
You too. When's Vince
gonna do another movie?

329
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,596
- Soon, very soon.
- Good.

330
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,233
You should find Vince
a movie to do with Amanda.

331
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,436
Yeah!

332
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,502
- That would be great.
- I'm more than a publicist.

333
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:14,910
I really should produce.

334
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,915
Give me your card,
I'll give you a call.

335
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,645
You know what,
I don't have a card.

336
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:22,153
What's the name
of your company?

337
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,052
You know what,
I don't have a company either.

338
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,717
- I'm getting that going.
- I'll put you two in touch.

339
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,249
- Okay, great.
- I'll call you.

340
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,091
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah.

341
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,960
You sound like a fucking moron,
you know that?

342
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,396
Thanks, Shauna.
It's weird.

343
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,024
Your eyes...
they look black in this light.

344
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,898
- You should seriously...
- Hey.

345
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,665
You're not gonna keep me
waiting are you? What're you doing?

346
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,968
- Hey, Shauna!
- Oh, fuck you, Ari!

347
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,769
Hey, hey,
who speaks like that at Koi?

348
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,503
I apologize.
She's in PR.

349
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,272
She knows not what...
You need to be punished.

350
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,870
Let's go.

351
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,245
This is retarded.

352
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,275
Do you wanna drop
two grand on headshots?

353
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,087
This won't be out
for another four weeks.

354
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,524
What do we have to do
to make sure my boy gets picked?

355
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,289
I do the picking.

356
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:06,662
How do I know this isn't
your signature?

357
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,860
Come on, Christy,
are you crazy?

358
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,631
That's the classic "Vincent Chase swoop"
on the V right there.

359
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,468
Yeah, yeah.
I got the same thing with my J.

360
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,407
Who are you?

361
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,470
I had an unbelievable lunch
with Dana Gordon.

362
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,379
The script is
coming in next week.

363
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,384
And... Kanpai...

364
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:30,013
I think I convinced her to attach Vinnie
before they get a director.

365
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,818
I should get
a fucking Pulitzer.

366
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,950
Ari, Vince doesn't want
to do "Aquaman."

367
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,551
What do you mean
he doesn't want to do "Aquaman"?

368
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:36,458
He hasn't read the script.

369
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,588
He has read "Medellin."
He wants to do that.

370
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,121
Where did you get that one?
Josh Weinstein?

371
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,896
- A little insecure, Ari?
- How did you get it?

372
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,837
Turtle found it on the subway.
What's it matter? We wanna do it.

373
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,430
And I want to fuck
Angelina Jolie.

374
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,499
The only difference is,
I might have a shot.

375
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,806
- We don't have a shot?
- No... you want to know why?

376
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,506
They're out to a guy.
I don't know if you ever heard of him.

377
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:55,478
His name is Tom Cruise.

378
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,038
Tom Cruise is gonna play
Pablo Escobar?

379
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,640
The guy is not
even Hispanic.

380
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,345
Hillary Swank has a vagina

381
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,616
and she won an Oscar
pretending she has a dick.

382
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:04,315
That's what actors do...
they pretend.

383
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,721
I get it.
I get it, okay.

384
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,089
So, what if Cruise passes?

385
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,356
They go to Brad Pitt.
He passes, they go to Keanu Reeves.

386
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,794
And on down the list.

387
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,297
- Where is Vince on that list?
- He ain't on the list.

388
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,629
How do we get him
on the list?

389
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,464
You do "Aquaman,"
you stupid fuck.

390
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:26,167
- Let's go.
- All right, let's do it.

391
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,021
Okay, great.
I think we got what we need.

392
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,889
Wait, hold on a second,
pal.

393
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,520
I got a couple of wardrobe changes.
Turtle!

394
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,296
Who is this guy?

395
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:57,301
- Okay.
- Suck in that gut a little, Drama.

396
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,673
Fuck you, Turtle.

397
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,439
How's the hair look?
Good?

398
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,712
Before he did
"Born on the Fourth of July,"

399
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,445
Tom Cruise did "Top Gun."

400
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,680
Hanks fucked a fish before
he did "Forrest Gump."

401
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,655
We need a commercially viable
popcorn flick,

402
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,817
like "Matterhorn" would
have been.

403
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,351
- We can get "Aquaman."
- We can get a lot of things.

404
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:18,954
Since Vince doesn't want
to do "Aquaman,"

405
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,555
let's talk about those things.

406
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,829
Really, we can get a lot
of other things? You know?

407
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,733
- Yeah.
- You know what we can get?

408
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,897
You don't even know the name
of your own fucking company.

409
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,634
"Stop cursing at Koi.
You're embarrassing me."

410
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:29,936
You know what's embarrassing...

411
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,034
is that you are managing
your best friend

412
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,637
right out of the business.
That would roughly be embarrassing.

413
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,307
That is not true.
You'll be singing a different tune

414
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,475
when you see
"Queens Boulevard."

415
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:41,850
We need a career intervention,
is what we need.

416
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,878
No more arguing.
No more bullshit.

417
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,753
We're going to sit down,
the three of us,

418
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,282
and I'm going to lay out
for you clearly,

419
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,624
what our options are.

420
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,391
This town is littered
with the trashed careers

421
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,126
of the "once upon a time"
movie stars.

422
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,896
Don't let our boy be
a cautionary tale.

423
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,472
Okay. Well,
I conceptualized this

424
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,000
when I was on a walk-about
in the Badlands.

425
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,604
And I stumbled
on this briar patch of berries.

426
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,979
And I ate every berry
I could see,

427
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,849
because I thought that would be
nurturement from the earth to me.

428
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,047
Vincent. Teeth.

429
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,181
And after I ate the berries,
this came to me.

430
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,986
Each one of these
represents...

431
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,118
Don't ever commit to shit
without talking to me first.

432
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,356
I gotta have some freedom
to operate, E.

433
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,057
You gotta earn freedom.

434
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,124
Why didn't you get this guy
to do my shots? He's a real pro.

435
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,897
All right, you know what?
Fuck you.

436
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:34,030
And fuck you, all right?
That's it, I'm done. I quit.

437
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,866
What's he quitting?

438
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,901
He gets paid?

439
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,971
I don't think there's a word
in the Earth language

440
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,983
- or in the dictionary to define...
- Mm-hmm.

441
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,986
...what it did to me.
But it was up in here.

442
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,511
It was in my heart, my spirit,
my soul, my mind, my emotions.

443
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,456
- No anxiety...
- Gary, how many pictures do we need?

444
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:57,121
One perfect one. It comes from the light
of the sun after it's set.

445
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:58,993
It's 11:30 now, Gary.

446
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,898
I know it is.
But we must wait for this precious time.

447
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,799
Well, we have a meeting.

448
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:07,032
Your meeting and your future
is meaningless.

449
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,699
Gary, a couple more pictures
and that's it.

450
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,970
Guys, let me ask you
a question.

451
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,670
What's more important...

452
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,313
Oh, great.
Now what?

453
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,180
Got a big one
for you fellas today.

454
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,387
Yo, "H&H Bagels."
All right!

455
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,654
- How you doing, Blake?
- What's happening?

456
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,661
Yo, check it out.
"Carnegie Knishes."

457
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,128
Nice!

458
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,131
What else you got?

459
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,655
Whatever this is.

460
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,759
Oh!

461
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,201
"Eddie's Pizza"!

462
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,330
What a score.
It's like being back in New York.

463
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,806
- Nice, E!
- I didn't do it.

464
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,502
Who did?

465
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,646
Jesus, E.

466
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,648
You never came up with
something like this.

467
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,547
Yo, great job, Turtle.
Come down here!

468
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,347
Yeah, Turtle,
good job!

469
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,219
Oh, any corned beef?

470
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,157
I'm not coming out till
all of yous apologize.

471
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,784
And that means you, too,
Vince.

472
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,493
I'm sorry.

473
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:07,896
I didn't do nothing.

474
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,867
Sorry, Turtle!

475
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,835
Now the "Lucky Charm."

476
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,168
Come on, E.

477
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,640
Yeah, come on.
This is impressive.

478
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,905
Whose DHL number
is this?

479
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,344
It's Ari's.

480
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,577
I'm sorry.

481
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,743
I knew
you would like that.

482
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,912
Get down here
and help us carry this shit.

483
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,649
Yeah, that figures.

484
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,604
These are great.

485
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,299
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

486
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,808
Yeah, except, what's with
the big apple behind your head?

487
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:53,072
Ah, it doesn't matter.

488
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,644
This is our year,
Johnny.

489
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,546
Can you feel it?

490
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:02,384
So, twice in two days, huh?

491
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,048
Must be important.

492
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,182
E didn't explain
the situation to you?

493
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,920
Did you explain to E
that there wouldn't be any lunch?

494
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,157
I would have waited
for my pizzas to defrost.

495
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,097
You didn't tell him
what I told you?

496
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,622
I told him you wanted
to sit down and talk.

497
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,635
I thought we just
sat down and talked.

498
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,637
What's the situation,
Ari?

499
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,536
- You seem stressed.
- Uh...

500
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:25,599
Yeah.
We can't get "Medellin."

501
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,838
Why not?

502
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,642
Because they're looking
at other people.

503
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,945
So call and tell them
to look at me.

504
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,348
You don't think
I've been on the phone?

505
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,478
You're the "most powerful agent
in the business."

506
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,044
One of the most powerful,
yeah.

507
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,954
No, you said
when I signed with you

508
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,288
you were "the most powerful."
He said that to you?

509
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,089
- A bunch of times.
- Shut the fuck up, Eric!

510
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,892
Listen, Ari, snap out of it,
all right?

511
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,593
If they're not looking at me,
you call them.

512
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:49,998
Tell them to look at me.

513
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,970
They'll listen to you,
all right? We cool?

514
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:55,472
I'm starved.
Let's get outta here.

515
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,372
Vince,
we have to do "Aquaman."

516
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:02,441
You didn't tell him
any of this?

517
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,472
No, he told me.
He told me, okay?

518
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:08,043
And Eric also told you
that I don't want to do "Aquaman."

519
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:10,111
If we can't get
"Medellin,"

520
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,453
then we will wait
for something else that I love.

521
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,354
For the past three months,

522
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,829
while your boy has been sitting
on your indy set pouring creamers

523
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:22,994
and getting no pussy, I have been scouring
this town for an offer.

524
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,829
It ain't out there.

525
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,669
Come on.

526
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,538
Okay.

527
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,566
Here's an offer
for you to star...

528
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,408
in a new
Olsen twins' movie.

529
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,812
It's a love triangle in which little Mary Kate
and Ashley

530
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:39,078
use you as an experiment
to see if you can tell

531
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:41,017
if they are two separate,
distinct people.

532
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:42,917
This would be mildly amusing

533
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:47,220
if the producer didn't think
he had a realistic shot of getting you.

534
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,156
It ain't eight months ago,
man.

535
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,995
Listen, you cooled off.

536
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,331
The $5 million offers
do not exist.

537
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,702
But Warner's loves you,
so "Aquaman" does.

538
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,476
What do you think,
Eric?

539
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:09,970
We should read "Aquaman"
and then see what's what.

540
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,040
Excellent representation.
Nice work, E.

541
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:15,314
You know what I think?
I would rather quit the business

542
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,184
than to do more shit
that I don't love.

543
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,190
I've done that.

544
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,851
And you know what,
it sucks.

545
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,690
I was only partially joking
about Neil Labute, Ari.

546
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,491
I'll go do a play.

547
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,691
I'd rather do a play
than this bullshit.

548
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,200
Don't forget,
I came from nothing.

549
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:33,466
As much as I love the toys,
I don't need them.

550
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,967
Well, that went well.

551
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,909
I don't want this
to get to a place

552
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,509
where you start blaming me
for everything.

553
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:49,247
You guys don't listen to me.
Listen to this...

554
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,755
you tell your boy
to do "Aquaman,"

555
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,419
or you tell him to find
other representation.

556
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:20,515
Yo!

557
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:23,385
My headshots were
a monster hit.

558
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,962
This is gonna be
a great fucking year.

559
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,260
- Can you feel it?
- Mm-hmm.
