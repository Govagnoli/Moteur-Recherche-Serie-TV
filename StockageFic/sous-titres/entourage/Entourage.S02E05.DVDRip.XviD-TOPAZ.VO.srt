1
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,671
- Hello.
- What, do you wake up at noon, Eric?

2
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,910
It's 10:15. I had a late night.
What's up?

3
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,943
You're gonna have a fabulous day.
Get up and grab "Variety."

4
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,785
- Why? What's it say in "Variety"?
- I told you I'd get you the cover,

5
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,486
- and I did.
- Holy shit.

6
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,460
What's it say?

7
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,122
Hold on.
Christy, come on.

8
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:40,064
It says, "Vincent Chase
swims into 'Aquaman'."

9
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,364
Clever, huh? And they got
his picture side by side

10
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:45,462
with Jeffrey Katzenberg,
so it looks more gorgeous by comparison.

11
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:48,406
- Fuck me.
- No thank you. It'd be nice

12
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,035
- if you sent me flowers. Bye.
- How can they print that?

13
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,305
- It's not even true.
- Come on.

14
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,006
"Variety" is like
a high school paper.

15
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,947
They pay their writers
28 grand a year

16
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,576
to find out something to write
about the popular kids.

17
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,018
What are we gonna do, Ari?
This is a big problem.

18
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,181
First of all,
there is no "we" in "I."

19
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,714
I am already on it.
I called Dana Gordon.

20
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,726
You spend a lot of time
waiting to be called back.

21
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,888
You know what? I got her her job,
so she will call me back.

22
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,330
- What should I tell Vince?
- Until we confirm that Leo

23
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,630
is actually doing this movie,
nothing has changed.

24
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,068
We heard this from a fucking
club promoter named Chucky.

25
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,834
Until we find this out from someone
who works in this business,

26
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,570
- Vince is still Aquaman.
- You're still Vince's agent.

27
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,441
Keep checking with me
to confirm that.

28
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:31,309
Yo, E, this is Vince's first cover.
Good job, baby.

29
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:35,720
E, you're en fuego. I may want you
to start managing me soon.

30
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,125
Why haven't you asked
to manage me yet?

31
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,354
He's waiting for your new legs
to come in, Drama.

32
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:44,022
Speaking of which, you gonna give me
cash or Vincent's black card,

33
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,088
'cause there's a couple
more things I might need.

34
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,623
What do you want to do now,
get your ears pinned back?

35
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,694
We need a new set of kitchen knives,
dickface. These blades are for shit.

36
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,263
You know Vince likes
his tomatoes sliced paper thin.

37
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,502
Oh, and, E,
Carrie Carlson called.

38
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,808
See that rug in the living room?
She's gonna need 50K for that.

39
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,940
I'll need a grand for a steam cleaner
'cause Arnold had a little problem.

40
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:07,316
We might want to consider a permanently
installed wok. Very versatile.

41
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,379
Guys, look, there's something important
we need to talk about.

42
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,891
- Yo yo!
- Hey, guys.

43
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,362
- Hey to you, neighbor.
- What happened to Cindy last night?

44
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,887
We're hanging out, having a good time.
She just broke out.

45
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,900
Don't worry, Turtle,
I'll find you a girl.

46
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,027
- You promise?
- I promise.

47
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,037
I'm gonna grab my stuff.

48
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,437
Be right back.

49
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:31,773
Hey, Vince, E's got something really
important to talk about.

50
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,279
What's up?

51
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,373
Nothing. I just...

52
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,150
- Hello.
- Delivery.

53
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,751
Hey, welcome
to the neighborhood.

54
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,729
- Hey, Bob Saget.
- There he is.

55
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,027
Aquaman himself.
How you doing?

56
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,229
Been reading about you all morning, man.
I live right next door.

57
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,237
I'm a big fan, Vince,
so are my daughters.

58
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,832
But do me a favor, don't fuck 'em.
Don't you fuck my daughters.

59
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,842
- I'm just fucking with you.
- Hey, Bob.

60
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,140
- Staci, how you doing?
- Good.

61
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,306
Is that cute little filly
Michelle in town?

62
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,816
No, she's modeling in Dubai.
She'll be back on Saturday.

63
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,818
- Make sure she calls me, will you?
- I will.

64
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,513
I just got divorced.

65
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,749
Ex-wife got the house
in the Palisades.

66
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,917
No biggie. I got four other houses.
I don't give a shit.

67
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,723
Well, I gotta go.
See ya.

68
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,424
- Bye. Good to see you.
- Bye.

69
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,059
- Bye-bye.
- Look at that gait.

70
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,798
Who do you think is more recognizable,
you or me? Seriously.

71
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,931
Anyway I've taken up
enough of you guys' time.

72
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:37,465
Have fun. Enjoy the muffins... handmade.
Anybody an Xbox guy?

73
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,240
All right, I'm right next door.
Good to see you.

74
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,908
Welcome to the neighborhood, man.
Congrats.

75
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,416
All right.

76
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,748
- Hey, Bob, see ya.
- See ya, man, take it easy.

77
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,755
- Bye, dude. Take care.
- All right.

78
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,087
- Be good.
- You too.

79
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,218
Who the fuck was that guy?

80
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,888
All I'm saying, Vince,
is we should have a house rule:

81
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,897
Either we all get laid
or nobody gets laid.

82
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,900
That way you know you'll always have
a ride home for your girl.

83
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:04,164
Staci doesn't need a ride.
She's three houses down.

84
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:06,296
Turtle's the one
looking for a ride.

85
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,536
I live three doors down from the cast
of "America's Next Top Model,"

86
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:12,476
and I ain't getting laid?
That's the worst cold streak ever.

87
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,037
Turtle, a cold streak
implies that you were once hot.

88
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,049
Go easy on him, E.
Come on.

89
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,449
Even A-Rod goes on
a bad run sometimes.

90
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:23,387
Yeah, but even when A-Rod's slumping,
he's still getting pussy.

91
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,051
Keep fucking laughing, E.
You give me the manager title,

92
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,253
- I'll be overflowing in it.
- Walsh!

93
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,364
There he is,
Mr. Studio Feature.

94
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,865
Hey, I thought
we were indie guys.

95
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,427
Suits got you headed
for superstardom, huh?

96
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,564
I'm just fucking around.
Cameron's great.

97
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,574
But listen, I'm writing
something for you.

98
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,441
- You'd better be available.
- Anything for you. You know that.

99
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:49,141
You hear that, suit?
That's an oral agreement. Don't fuck me.

100
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,851
All right,
who's ready to loop?

101
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,580
I am.

102
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,884
Nah, Johnny,
your sound is clean.

103
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,084
This is Vince's day, okay?

104
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,992
See, I project a lot
better than you, bro. Sorry.

105
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,189
Hey, Turtle, you wanna do
a little lap around here?

106
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,788
- Yeah.
- See you guys later.

107
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:10,030
- See ya.
- So can we see a little footage?

108
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,197
Through the glass.
No one sits in on my sessions.

109
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,542
See now these
countertops are nice,

110
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,170
but these cabinets are for shit.
Who would do that?

111
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,243
Look, I'm gonna let
you have this one.

112
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:30,585
Don't worry about it. Just focus,
keep your eye on the ball, all right?

113
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:33,057
- All right.
- Look alive out there.

114
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,694
Hey, honey, how you doin'?

115
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,498
Enough's enough, man.

116
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,971
- Who are you calling?
- Lorraine, my sure thing.

117
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,973
She can't spell "no."

118
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,237
I'm gonna put an end
to the streak right now.

119
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:53,837
Stick it in the mailbox
once I'm gone.

120
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,871
Let the cops
chase after a dead man.

121
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,652
But he was your brother.

122
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:03,587
Half-brother.

123
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,648
Take care of yourself.

124
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:10,590
Hey, you ever coming back?

125
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,088
You kidding?
I am Queens Boulevard.

126
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,226
This shit looks amazing.

127
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,170
- This gonna be a good movie.
- Yeah, it looks real good.

128
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,366
Hey, you ever coming back?

129
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,874
You kidding?

130
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,173
I am Queens Boulevard.

131
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,544
- Listen, guys, we have a major problem.
- Don't worry about Turtle.

132
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,277
Johnny Drama's got one of his
sure things on the way.

133
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,080
He's not talking
about me, asshole.

134
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,314
The guy's been stressed out
about shit all day.

135
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:36,946
What's the problem, E?

136
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,457
All right, this is serious.
You can't tell Vince.

137
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,461
- What is it?
- We have no money.

138
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:46,056
- Yeah, right.
- Come on, E, what do you mean?

139
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,931
Vince spent every last dollar he had
on that house down payment.

140
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,232
We have no other money.
The bills keep piling up.

141
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,830
- We gotta shut down the spending.
- E, would you relax?

142
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,774
We got that big fat check from "Aquaman"
coming any day now.

143
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,369
No, it's not.
They pulled the offer.

144
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,779
You kidding?

145
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,944
I am Queens Boulevard.

146
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,715
Bam!

147
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,949
That is why
you're a movie star.

148
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,016
I got Dana Gordon's
assistant on the phone.

149
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,696
What the fuck
are you wearing?

150
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,721
I'm trying out new looks.

151
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,892
This one's my Andre 3000.
You like?

152
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,993
No, I don't. You look like
Michelle Kwan in drag.

153
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,834
Do a triple fucking axel over
to the phone and try Cameron again.

154
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,603
- Where is she, Amanda?
- This is Jan. Amanda was fired.

155
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:33,305
- Jan, where is she?
- I'm sorry. I haven't seen her all day.

156
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,314
- You new in town?
- I've been here a month.

157
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,407
Okay, you probably
don't know me. You will.

158
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,384
Pass this message
along to Dana.

159
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,613
Tell her I still have
the pictures from Cancun.

160
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,622
Tell her I'm gonna
start a website.

161
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,955
I'm gonna take a full-page ad
in "The LA Times" advertising it.

162
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,655
It will be called "I'm a Hollywood
Executive Whore dot-com,"

163
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,027
and no password or fee
will be required.

164
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:56,524
Tell her I want
a fucking callback.

165
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,833
E, when can I sit down
with James Cameron?

166
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,805
Ari's waiting for a call.

167
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,900
Wow. Even Ari can't get
Cameron on the phone.

168
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,911
Yo, Vince, James Cameron
ain't that great.

169
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,743
What are you talking about?
You saw "Terminator" a hundred times.

170
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,510
I watched it for Linda Hamilton.

171
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,417
Plus he likes to see the governor
naked at the beginning.

172
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,250
- Anthony.
- E. What's going on, players?

173
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,816
- What's going on?
- Nothing like what you got going on.

174
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:23,351
Listen, Vince, if they're looking
for a little color for that film,

175
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,297
I'd be a great fish.
Prepare 'em to pay my quote though.

176
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,323
- I'll do what I can.
- Hey, do more than that.

177
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,995
Remember who got
your brother that part in "Barbershop."

178
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,164
- They cut me out.
- You got paid, Drama,

179
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:36,231
so shut the fuck up,
you ungrateful bitch.

180
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,709
Jesus! All right,
take care, Vince, man.

181
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,836
See ya, buddy.

182
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,848
- Yeah.
- Hey, Vince.

183
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,316
I got a table for you guys
right out here.

184
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,946
So how you been?
You been busy, Jamie?

185
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,149
Yeah, I've been
real good actually.

186
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,215
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

187
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,422
- Why don't you join us?
- Because I'm working, Turtle.

188
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,430
Damn.

189
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,955
Ice cold.

190
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,436
Don't you worry, Turtle.
Lorraine is on her way.

191
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,132
- James Cameron's office.
- Hi, who am I speaking with?

192
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,800
This is James's assistant Emily.

193
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,934
Hey, Emily, this is Ari Gold.
Do you know me?

194
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:14,504
Yeah, Ari,
it's Emily.

195
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:17,380
You're joking, right, Ari?

196
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,544
Emily! I totally forgot
that you work over there.

197
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,918
- How are you?
- I am good, Ari.

198
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:26,186
- I'm amazing. You miss me?
- Like I miss head lice.

199
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,250
Uh-oh.
Did we end badly?

200
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,387
You were supposed to write me
a reference letter.

201
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,420
I can write another one
if you're unhappy.

202
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,593
- How do I get James on the phone?
- Wait for him to call you back.

203
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,229
'Cause I totally gave him
all nine messages.

204
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,828
Uh...

205
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,932
listen, Emily, honey,
what do you know about "Aquaman"?

206
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,670
That he fights crime underwater.

207
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,177
Bye, Ari.

208
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,008
You know, Johnny, I know
last night I said I was in,

209
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,382
but new calves?

210
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,444
Come on, man.
I can't let you do it.

211
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,319
It's ridiculous.

212
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:00,689
You know what, Vince? You're right.
I'm gonna put the calves on hold.

213
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:04,093
Really? Just like that?

214
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,462
Yeah, you made a good argument.

215
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,263
And Vince, I was thinking,
that 70-inch plasma you got me,

216
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,269
it's a little too big
for my room.

217
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:14,363
If you don't mind,
I'd like to switch to a 50.

218
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,272
Or maybe a 30.

219
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,674
Maybe I don't even need
a TV in my room at all.

220
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,737
I'm jerking off way too much
as it is anyway.

221
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,550
Here's Lorraine.

222
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,314
Damn, she's hot
for a sure thing, Drama.

223
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,549
Relax. Let me
take care of this.

224
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,118
Turtle, sit up straight.

225
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:38,426
- Take your hat off, Turtle.
- Guys, don't mother me, okay?

226
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,126
There's the guy I was telling you about,
in green... Turtle.

227
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,135
Give her a wave.

228
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,899
No no, don't wave.
Give the nod.

229
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,500
Yeah. What?

230
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,740
Wait, baby, hold on.
He's a nice guy.

231
00:11:56,982 --> 00:12:00,315
- Don't sweat it, Turtle.
- You did the wave-nod, bro.

232
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:04,152
She could smell your desperation
from the doorway. That was a lay-up.

233
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,317
That's Staci.

234
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,417
Hello.

235
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,588
Hey, when are you
coming home?

236
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,790
Pretty soon. We're just
finishing up lunch.

237
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,266
You and the boys should come by.
I've got a bunch of friends

238
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,531
- hanging out by the pool.
- Really?

239
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,038
Is that girl Turtle
was talking to last night there?

240
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,540
- She's here.
- All right. We'll see you soon.

241
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,872
- Bye.
- Bye.

242
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,877
- Jamie, can we get a check?
- Yeah.

243
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,879
She's there.
She thinks you're cute.

244
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,710
She saw you at night,
so don't be upset

245
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,808
when you get there
and she's not so excited.

246
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,012
Please, Drama.
All I need is a little Vince magic,

247
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,021
- put me right back on track.
- Thanks, Vince.

248
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,046
- I got that.
- I got it. I got it.

249
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,921
All right, what the fuck
is going on?

250
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,417
You guys haven't paid
for anything since '95. Come on.

251
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,590
I don't even believe you
have money in your pockets.

252
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:47,929
I got your Visa card, Vince.

253
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:54,167
He doesn't want calves.
He doesn't want a new plasma.

254
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,935
All right.

255
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,500
Come on, 'fess up.
What, am I getting "Punk'd"?

256
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,104
- Ask E.
- Ask E.

257
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,509
How could you not tell me this?

258
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,714
I'm waiting to hear from Ari
about what's going on.

259
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,485
Don't hide things from me.
You're supposed to be my best friend.

260
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,720
I'm your manager now.
I'm trying to do what's right.

261
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,024
I'm walking around town
like a total jerkoff.

262
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:20,031
I mean, people are
congratulating me.

263
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,966
It's totally humiliating.
And we bought the house!

264
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,197
What did Ari say?

265
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:28,601
Here's the good news:
I spoke to Leo's agent.

266
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,109
He's a friend.
He's out.

267
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,941
Leo is booked until '09,
and beside that,

268
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,573
since "Titanic" he won't
go anywhere near the water.

269
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:39,015
- And this is good news?
- I'm trying, Vinnie.

270
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,485
Yeah, well, try harder, Ari.

271
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,012
You too, Eric. You're right,
you're not my friend on this.

272
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,684
You're my manager.

273
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,694
You sit around waiting
for other people to call you back.

274
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,958
You sit around waiting
for him to call you back.

275
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,828
Go somewhere
and do something.

276
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,767
Don't tell me that it's good news
that a movie I didn't want to do

277
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:01,501
that you talked me into
is still possibly mine.

278
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,067
Now that James Cameron is doing
this movie, I want it, all right? Badly.

279
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,738
So get up off your asses

280
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,977
and accomplish something,
or I will find people who can.

281
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,613
You can find your
own way home too.

282
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,151
We gotta get Cameron
to see "Queens Boulevard."

283
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,853
You haven't even seen it yet!

284
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,692
I saw the scenes Vince looped today.
They looked amazing.

285
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,494
So you want me to get
the biggest director in the game

286
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,696
to see some low-budget indie flick
that you think is amazing

287
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,899
based on some out-of-context scenes
from a looping stage.

288
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,930
What do you suggest?

289
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:39,001
I suggest that we get the two
of them in a room together.

290
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,275
How you gonna do that, Ari? You can't
even get anyone to call you back.

291
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,874
- I'm gonna call Emily.
- She doesn't care for us, Eric.

292
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,112
Yeah well, there's no
"us" in "me," Ari.

293
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,449
Yo, fuck Aquaman, Vince.

294
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,220
There's plenty other
superheroes out there.

295
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,060
- Yo, you'd make a great Green Lantern.
- Thanks, Turtle.

296
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,395
Vince, guys, come on in.

297
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,984
Oh, God is shining
down on me today.

298
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:27,550
Turtle, if you can't get
laid here, turn your dick in.

299
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,824
Come on, I'll introduce
you guys to the girls.

300
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,831
I'm gonna find the loo.

301
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,704
- Right there.
- Yo, Aquaman.

302
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,764
What do you say you and I
dive into the pool,

303
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:46,369
see who can hold our breath the longest?
I'll bet you a million dollars I win.

304
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,040
You don't have that kind
of money yet, do you? I do.

305
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,572
Vince, wait, I gotta
tell you something. Hold on, baby.

306
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,744
I'll be right back. Vince...

307
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,946
You are my idol. Seriously.

308
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,551
Staci, she's a fucking thoroughbred.

309
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,493
I've been trying
to close her for years.

310
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,555
I offered her 100 grand once
for one night at the Four Seasons Maui.

311
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,862
You know what she did?
She smacked me in the face.

312
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,835
You are a stallion, man.

313
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:14,202
It's not every day
somebody scores the madam.

314
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,571
Madam?

315
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,668
- Oh no, come on.
- I can't believe you didn't know that.

316
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,010
You gotta be kidding me.
You're not kidding me?

317
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:25,210
I got a house account here...
here and Nate 'n Al's.

318
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,582
Just those two places, man.

319
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,951
Oh, Vince, baby.

320
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,583
Listen to me,
don't sweat it.

321
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,616
Staci is one piece of pussy
that has no price.

322
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,933
Dude.

323
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,428
Eric Murphy.

324
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,400
Why am I not surprised?

325
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,843
I don't know.
I was kind of hoping you would be.

326
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,847
Oh, well, I expected
you days ago.

327
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,349
Yeah.

328
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,682
Did you quit smoking yet?

329
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,744
- Four months.
- Really?

330
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,756
- Mm-hmm.
- Nice. Me too.

331
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,781
- Really? Wow.
- Yeah.

332
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:10,420
You wanna grab a cup
of coffee or something?

333
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,090
Well, I guess you probably
can't leave here, right?

334
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,100
James is not like Ari.

335
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,227
I can do what I want.

336
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,863
James. You call him James?

337
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,373
The string painting she did,
I'm getting it framed.

338
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,706
- You know that, right?
- She's very talented.

339
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:27,405
- She does beautiful work.
- Ari, I think it's nice

340
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,176
that you're finally taking
an interest in the family.

341
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,683
Come on, why are you making
such a big deal of this?

342
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,686
I'm not some absentee dad.

343
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,813
- Come on.
- Ari.

344
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,686
- Hey, baby.
- There's your dad.

345
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,692
There she is.

346
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,694
- Hey, sweetie.
- There's my girl.

347
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,492
Hey, how are you?
Dana Gordon!

348
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,396
I'll be right back.

349
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,893
- You are an animal, Ari.
- Total surprise. Give me one second.

350
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,202
Amazing you're still
showing up at school like this.

351
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,175
Won't let the nanny do it? Whatever
they're paying you, it's not enough.

352
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,178
What are you doing here?
It's not a good time.

353
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,976
Okay, fine. When is a good time?
Tonight at your house?

354
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,610
- Invite your husband, have a slideshow.
- You're out of your mind.

355
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,519
I have never been jerked around
like this before, Dana, never.

356
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:13,548
And I will not tolerate it
from some glorified D-girl.

357
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,527
Do not fucking talk to me like that,
Ari. My job is on the line.

358
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,554
You don't think I want Vince?
I want Vince, Alan wants Vince.

359
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,089
What about Mr. Cameron?
Does he want Vince?

360
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,863
He doesn't
know who Vince is.

361
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,631
Jesus!

362
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:28,037
- Look, we're working on that.
- Okay, listen.

363
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,234
Let's get the two of them
in a room together.

364
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,870
Anywhere on this planet.
I will pay for it if I have to.

365
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,005
Vinnie will take care
of the rest, all right?

366
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:39,484
- Fine.
- All right.

367
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,079
Baby, what are you...

368
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,215
Can I get a ride?

369
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:52,519
I flew in this stuff from
Colombia on my own private jet.

370
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:55,431
Sandinistas don't know shit
about overthrowing a government,

371
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,731
but I'll tell you,
they sure do grow some fine herb.

372
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:00,966
- It's really nice, Bob.
- Bob, I don't know if you remember,

373
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,873
but I did an ep
of "Full House" in '94.

374
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,504
I played Stamos's
tough-guy nephew.

375
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,947
Really? I don't remember that.

376
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,110
Don't take it
personally, Johnny.

377
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,052
I was so whacked out
on Vikes and Halcion

378
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,885
during the '90s,
I don't remember shit.

379
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,386
I'm clean now though, right?

380
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:29,029
- I remember that part. You were great.
- Really?

381
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:33,367
Hey, Misty, why don't you
show me your room, baby?

382
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:36,670
Come on, I got some stuff
I want you to see.

383
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,699
Got some Courvoisier.

384
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:43,475
Did you just get
cock-blocked by Bob Saget?

385
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,683
- Hi there.
- Are you mad?

386
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,381
No, I'm just
a little shocked.

387
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,151
Why?

388
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,490
I don't know. I mean, do I, like,
owe you money now?

389
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,927
Don't be an asshole, Vince.
I'm not a hooker.

390
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,761
Good, because I've
never paid for sex.

391
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,892
And I'm not looking to start,

392
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,335
although you'd
be worth every penny.

393
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,271
I should pay you.

394
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,609
Oh my God,

395
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,908
look at my poor boys.

396
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:18,383
It's gonna be like telling them
there's no Santa Claus.

397
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:22,080
Vince, I feel awful
about deceiving you guys.

398
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,783
So I'm gonna pay for Turtle and Drama
to have a good time today

399
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,725
- out of my own pocket.
- No, I can't let you do that.

400
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,558
- How much is it?
- My girls usually get

401
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,430
between $5,000 and $7,000
for the full pampering package.

402
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,264
Wow.

403
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,635
You know, money's
a little tight right now.

404
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,663
Can I finance this?

405
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,370
Sure.

406
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,401
Right here.

407
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,416
Right here.

408
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:08,958
Oh oh!

409
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,662
- What are you guys so happy about?
- Skyrockets in flight, E.

410
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:19,040
- He had a little afternoon delight.
- What, the neighbor's house?

411
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:22,843
I met this girl Jeanette. Couldn't lose
this girl in a maze... she loved me.

412
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,076
Yeah, mine too.
She took me up into her bedroom

413
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,415
and performed like it was
strictly business.

414
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,853
- I'm back, baby, I'm back.
- Yeah, baby.

415
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:34,552
Hey, thanks, bro.
Look, I know these girls are pros,

416
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,187
but don't tell Turtle.
It'll break his heart.

417
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:40,130
Yo, Vince,
way to hook it up.

418
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,633
I know those girls were hookers,
but don't tell John.

419
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,068
His streak's like five times
as long as mine.

420
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,441
- So, E, what do you got?
- I got something.

421
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,070
- It's not perfect, but it's something.
- Would you just say it?

422
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,080
James Cameron is gonna screen
"Queens Boulevard."

423
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,674
- Yes!
- You talked to James Cameron?

424
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:02,153
- Emily did actually, yeah.
- You're gonna start up with her again?

425
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,779
We'll start as friends and see.

426
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,552
Friends are girls you just haven't
fucked yet. You know that.

427
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:09,617
Thanks for the wisdom. I'm gonna go
see Walsh. Anybody wanna come?

428
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,424
- Nope.
- No.

429
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,357
Hey.

430
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,369
Real sorry to bother you, Eric,

431
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,701
but can you explain why
my meeting's canceled?

432
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:24,641
- What meeting, Ari?
- Vince's meeting with James Cameron.

433
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,667
They said that he will
not take the meeting

434
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,112
until after he sees
"Queens Boulevard."

435
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:32,583
Can you fucking explain
that to me, Eric?

436
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,346
I didn't think you
could get the meeting.

437
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,581
Emily didn't think so either.
Don't worry about it.

438
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,589
- Cameron'll love it.
- He better.

439
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:42,081
Because you know what?
It's all on you now, Eric.

440
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,401
- Billy!
- Suit, what's the word?

441
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,738
Got great news.
Before they finalize Vince's deal,

442
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:00,472
James Cameron wants to screen
"Queens Boulevard."

443
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,343
- You serious?
- Believe that shit?

444
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,042
James Cameron
is gonna see your movie.

445
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:06,550
- He's coming to Sundance?
- No, we're gonna send a print

446
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:09,315
- to his house.
- Fuck that.

447
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:11,914
Hey, neighbor.
Hi, Billy.

448
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,653
We have to make this quick.
I have a 9:00.

449
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,820
Billy, look,
this is important, man.

450
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,490
Look, suit,
nobody sees my film till Sundance.

451
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,261
James Cameron wants to see it,
tell him he can stand in line

452
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,268
in the snow
like everybody else.

453
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:26,930
Excuse me. I only have an hour
to take care of business.

454
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,371
- Shall we?
- Billy, listen...

455
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,274
I think I made myself clear.

456
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,909
Can I have a shot
of Jack?
