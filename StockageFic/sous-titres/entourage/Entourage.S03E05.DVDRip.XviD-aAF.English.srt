1
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,232
- Hey, Ari.
- Where are you?

2
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,316
Are you being fucked with a jackhammer?

3
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,874
- $10 in the curse jar, Daddy.
- Sorry, baby.

4
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,480
- I'm test-driving a car.
- Matchbox or Hot Wheels?

5
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,239
Funny. Vince feels bad
about giving away my Maserati.

6
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,236
When my father gave away my car

7
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,953
I had to lose my virginity
on the back of a moped.

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,719
- What do you want?
- The road to Bogotá starts here, E.

9
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,799
You want Medellin, you got to get Warner
Brothers to dry-dock Aquaman 2 for 90 days.

10
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,832
Just talk to Haggis's people.
That's what they need.

11
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,872
- We'll tell Alan when we see him.
- He's head of the studio.

12
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,195
We don't tell him shit. We ask nicely.

13
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,869
Vince really wants to do Medellin.
He already started learning Spanish.

14
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,993
He left 15 messages on the machine.
The wife thinks I'm fucking the gardener.

15
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,792
What the fuck?

16
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,070
11 o'clock, E. Don't be late.

17
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,992
A little early, isn't it, Gold?

18
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,476
- That your car, Max?
- Yeah.

19
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,636
It's blocking my driveway.

20
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,514
Sorry. My driver forgot to move it.
If I give you the keys, pull it around?

21
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,189
Who's in charge of you?
I'd like to speak to an adult.

22
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,677
My folks are in Gstaad. You want to complain
about me, try my agent or my housekeeper.

23
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,632
Inez's English is for shit, but she's home.

24
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,470
Make sure that I don't see you
anywhere near my daughter.

25
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,274
You like it?

26
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,437
I like it, but I don't need it.

27
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,630
But you'll take it?

28
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,272
Yeah, I'll take it.

29
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,276
Good to see you embrace your inner mooch.

30
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,038
What about you, Johnny? You pick?

31
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,878
Really, Vince? I don't know.

32
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,876
Come on, we took down Spidey!

33
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,799
What kind of Aquaman would I be if
I didn't take care of my Super Friends?

34
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,796
Who loves you, bro? I'll take blue.

35
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,114
So, this beast is for me?

36
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,516
Actually, Turtle, I have
another surprise in store for you.

37
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,879
Really?

38
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,195
Big Boy is gonna play one of Saigon's tracks.

39
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,595
I've been trying to get him airplay for a year.

40
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,631
He'll give your number to anyone who calls.

41
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,478
Get out of here!
That's awesome, Vince. Thank you.

42
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,030
- Am I getting a car?
- Jesus.

43
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,514
- I thought that was better.
- Greedy bastard.

44
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,949
- Nice, Turtle.
- It is better. I'm sorry.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,834
I figure Saigon blows up, you might actually
be able to buy your own things.

46
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,155
You're right.
I want to stand on my own.

47
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,952
Thank you, Vince.

48
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,916
I'm fucking with you. Of course you get one.

49
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,234
- Tool.
- Idiot.

50
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,157
Tool idiot with an Aston Martin.

51
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,113
- So we take these to the studio?
- Unless we're schmucks driving the same car.

52
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,470
We'd be schmucks in Jettas.
In Aston Martins we look good.

53
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,159
- And independently wealthy.
- Good point.

54
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,475
Last one on the lot pays tax and title.

55
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,954
- Fuck that.
- Oh, Turtle.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,956
- Put on Big Boy.
- Now?

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,956
Yeah, right now.

58
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,239
Yeah, baby.

59
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,631
Vince, it don't stop ringing.

60
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,558
Hello? Yeah, I represent him.

61
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,114
Can I call you back in an hour
when I get to my office?

62
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,833
This is getting nuts.
You think Ari would talk to me?

63
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,633
- Why would Ari talk to you?
- Cos I'm in play.

64
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,319
Hello? Yeah, he's my guy.

65
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,148
- I'm not Persian enough to get one of those?
- Get us 90 days. Then we'll talk.

66
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,834
Vince, last time you were here

67
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,872
I told you I wanted you
in the Warner's family, right?

68
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,959
Well, now, I'm gonna show
you how we treat family.

69
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,154
Dana.

70
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,074
I'm like the studio's Vanna White.

71
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,996
- That's some allowance.
- About $1 million more than your old one.

72
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,393
Thank you.

73
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,795
No, Vince, thank you.

74
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,958
Now we feel this is the start
of a very, very successful relationship.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,070
Yeah. Listen.

76
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,430
Vince is so excited
that we're doing Aquaman 2.

77
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,040
- That's good to hear.
- But before we get into...

78
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,119
Before we jump into the tank,
Vinnie's got a little passion project

79
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,879
that he was really hoping
to sink his teeth into.

80
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,639
Well, passion's important, right?
What is it, Vince?

81
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,638
It's Paul Haggis's Medellin.
Pablo Escobar's story.

82
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,399
Medellin. Hell of a script.

83
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,749
Vince, that's a great role for you.

84
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,360
- So, what do you need from me?
- We...

85
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,558
- We have a slight scheduling conflict.
- Very slight.

86
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,070
- You'd like me to push back our start date.
- That's all we're asking.

87
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,159
For how long? I've got a water tank
the size of the Staples Center on stage five.

88
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,236
Who's gonna pay my utility bill?

89
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,670
Well, I have a $1 million cheque.
How big of a bill is it?

90
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,195
- 90 days, that's it.
- It'll make people see a different side of me.

91
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,198
You realise how important this franchise
is to the studio?

92
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,117
I do. And it's important to me too.

93
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,437
I could give you 65 days.

94
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,630
Will that help?

95
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,352
Enormously.

96
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,956
What are we supposed to do with 65 days?

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,913
What? Paul Haggis comes from TV. He could
shoot 40 pages in a day. He can do this.

98
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,678
- I hope so.
- What's wrong, Johnny?

99
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,235
- This guy's been on the phone the whole time.
- Vince, I need help.

100
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,589
I got to get back. Anything else I can do?

101
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,676
- Set the Haggis meeting.
- Done. What else?

102
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,392
- Pray.
- Done. What else?

103
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,758
I want you to talk to Turtle.
He needs some help with Saigon.

104
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,792
- Is he moving there?
- He's my rapper. He's blowing up.

105
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,513
- OK. You got five minutes.
- No, I need a sit-down.

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,275
- He needs a sit-down.
- OK, you know what?

107
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,550
I'm going to be at Equinox at the juice bar.

108
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,795
Triple berry dreamsicles on me, OK?

109
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,037
I was thinking someplace like Spago,
where people see me with you.

110
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,912
- One o'clock, no sweatsuit.
- Fair enough.

111
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,469
Are you 100% el certainto it was Max?

112
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,548
Yes. Miss Sarah, she was on phone
with that Max talking about a boat trip.

113
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,953
Damn. Did she catch you?

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,391
No, but when I asked
about her plans for today, she said nothing.

115
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,238
She never lied to me before, Mr Ari.

116
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,191
But she lie! She lie!

117
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,152
It's Max. He's trying to steal our little girl's soul.

118
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,637
All right. Listen. You keep an ear out.
You got a big gift for Navidad coming, OK?

119
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,272
Was that Mr Gold?

120
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,675
No, that was El Salvador.

121
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,074
OK, Johnny, you gonna
tell me what's wrong?

122
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,114
Nothing. I guess I'm the only guy in this house
that doesn't measure up to the Gold standard.

123
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,832
Wanna talk to Ari? Is that it?

124
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,111
I've been waiting to talk to Ari for five years.

125
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,957
I'm an actor with no agent.

126
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,276
You know what they say.
An actor with no agent is...

127
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,629
- Is what?
- Is fucked.

128
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,116
All right, look. I'll call Ari,
but I can't make him represent you.

129
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,470
Putting me in a room with him
for a real discussion is all I can ask.

130
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,398
He wants us to share a meeting?
That's ridiculous.

131
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,237
Especially since I had the meeting first.

132
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,952
Ari's a busy guy.

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,798
That's fine. I'll take what I can get.
Thank you, bro.

134
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,479
So you're just gonna
hijack my meeting, Drama?

135
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,876
Fuck off, Turtle. If it wasn't for me,
none of you would be out here.

136
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,990
Without Vince, we wouldn't have stayed.

137
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,395
- Yeah, well...
- Well what?

138
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,992
- Shotgun.
- Shotgun?

139
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,076
- On the meeting, I talk first.
- Vince?

140
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,076
The guy called shotgun.

141
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,839
All right, it's time.
Let's go bag us some Haggis.

142
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,711
Let's do it.

143
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,877
- I got to roll to my meeting too.
- Our meeting, and I go first.

144
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,595
- Not if I beat you there.
- I called shotgun!

145
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,312
- Math club, huh, baby?
- Yeah, should be fun.

146
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,033
Never heard of a math club
going on a boat before.

147
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,470
It's just a bunch
of really smart kids, that's all.

148
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,192
Not smart enough.

149
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,952
How do you know it's Max?

150
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,117
A father knows when his daughter's
lying, baby. It's heartbreaking.

151
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,311
I'm not your baby. I'm 14 years old
and you're spying on me.

152
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,352
You can't keep us apart forever. I love him!

153
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,549
Lis...

154
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,637
Too slow, jerk-off.

155
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,833
- First.
- That's bullshit. I called shotgun.

156
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,836
You can't then go and negate that.

157
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,917
Your shotgun was called
off location so it means shit.

158
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,996
- We're on location now.
- So?

159
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,110
So, shotgun.

160
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,438
Ari says Haggis is intense.

161
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,596
- I don't want to freak him out.
- What do you want to do?

162
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,756
- Just keep him calm.
- How?

163
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,473
Whatever he says,
just tell him we'll work it out.

164
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,592
- What does that mean?
- Means we'll work it out.

165
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,676
- We always do, right?
- Exactly.

166
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,188
Let's go get him.

167
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,878
He's performed live a hundred times.

168
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,673
Just cos you haven't heard
of him doesn't mean shit.

169
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,915
You know what?
Call me then, I've got to go.

170
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,554
Sorry about that.
You know how it is. It's nonstop.

171
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,750
Turn your ringer off. My time is precious.

172
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,596
- It's ringing again, Ari.
- I'm sorry.

173
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,029
Enough with the sorrys. The clock is ticking.

174
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,311
OK, here we go. I got a two-phase plan.

175
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,636
First, there's 500 CDs pressed
and sitting in the trunk of my car.

176
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,671
You want us to sell them on the promenade?

177
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,678
You crack me up, Ari.

178
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,439
The second phase of the plan
is what I need you for.

179
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,948
I mean, A&R guys have been
calling me all day.

180
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,956
I need you to back me with the suits.

181
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,151
- He's gonna get a deal, guaranteed.
- I'm gonna get a piece?

182
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,031
You get a piece of his acting career.

183
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,275
- Does he act?
- All rappers act.

184
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,993
Vince said you were gonna
come and listen to me...

185
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,157
"Vince said he'd throw me
a piece of pussy because he's famous."

186
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,876
Whatever you want, Turtle. OK? I will rep you.
All right, next. Impress me, Drama.

187
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,359
Every small boy has a dream, Ari.

188
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,552
For some, that dream is to soar to the heavens
as an astronaut.

189
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,991
- For others, it's to step onto a Broadway...
- All right, I'll rep you.

190
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,955
- Really? You'll put me on your client list?
- If we don't have to stay for coffee.

191
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,678
How the fuck am I supposed
to turn a 90-day shoot into 65 days?

192
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,755
We'll work it out.

193
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,236
Vince, in order to shoot
this movie in Colombia,

194
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,953
I had to negotiate with the government,
drug lords,

195
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,309
FARC rebels and the fucking death squads,

196
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,078
and you want me to undo all that?

197
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,032
- We'll work it out.
- Why's he keep saying that?

198
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,196
Because he believes we can.

199
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,437
All right, look. We want you
to think about how we can do this,

200
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,232
because we all really want to do it.

201
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,750
Well, it's real easy. All you have to do
is cut 30% of your key scenes.

202
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,190
- I don't want to do that.
- Come on, we all have to compromise.

203
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,595
OK, how about...
How about this one here?

204
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,677
This is where you go to your mom
and tell her you love her...

205
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,597
And she spits in my face. I love that.

206
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,153
It's a good one. It's gone.

207
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,760
- What else?
- I don't want to tell you your business

208
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,756
but can't you shoot the movie quicker?

209
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,473
I mean,
how long did it take you to shoot Crash?

210
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,511
Vince, I loved what I saw of Aquaman.

211
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,710
- Thank you.
- This is not Aquaman.

212
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,036
In this movie, I want you to play
what I like to call a human being.

213
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,550
Together, I want to humanise
one of the greatest monsters of all time.

214
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,435
What I want is even after the audience sees
you ruthlessly slaughter like 1,000 people,

215
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,630
I still want them to care.

216
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,150
I want them to care so much
that when you die they fucking weep.

217
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,432
They won't want to. They'll hate themselves
for it, but they will fucking weep.

218
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,152
I have to do this movie.

219
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,272
- Paul, he's got a contract.
- A contract?

220
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,758
If I let contracts rule my life, I'd be doing The
Facts of Life rather than hanging with my boys.

221
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,717
Thanks, Esteban.

222
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,194
- Hey, Ariel Gold.
- Hey, Penny.

223
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,471
Only my mom calls me that
and still I better have a fever of 103.

224
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,839
- How are you?
- OK.

225
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,519
- I was just up seeing one of your guys.
- Yeah? Who?

226
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,394
We're looking at Jimmy Whitaker
for the Encyclopaedia Brown trilogy.

227
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,796
Jimmy Whitaker, pride and joy
of my young burgeoning teen division.

228
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,551
Let's make a deal. You do the whole Schlemiel
Schlimazel Hasenpfeffer Incorporated

229
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,433
- he's all yours, all right?
- Don't be a schmuck, OK?

230
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,199
It's a great project.
It'll be a heck of a franchise.

231
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,117
The first takes place in the Kremlin.

232
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,913
Really? Good luck
faking Moscow in Vancouver.

233
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,030
No, no, no. The hell with Vancouver.

234
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,197
We're doing it right. 24 weeks in Kazakhstan.

235
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,078
Kazakhstan?

236
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,876
Jimmy Whitaker is a spoiled prick.

237
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,992
You wanna hire Max Ballard.
He's Dakota Fanning with a dick.

238
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,350
- I heard Ballard was difficult.
- He's a neighbour. Humble as pie.

239
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,709
I have been trying to sign that kid for years.

240
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,990
Wow, Ari.
He's not even one of your guys.

241
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,793
I am a team player.
Boom! You owe me. Come here.

242
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,031
- Quit smoking.
- All right.

243
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,991
What happened, E? Haggis
trying to cast you as a pygmy drug mule?

244
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,237
- Vince wants off Aquaman.
- What is this, déjà vu again?

245
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,589
- What did Haggis say?
- He needs 90 days.

246
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,110
Noah can build an ark
and save all of God's creatures in 40 days.

247
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,832
He can't shoot a movie in 65?

248
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,713
- Is there anything you can do?
- I can't control Haggis.

249
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,036
What if we call Cameron?
I can't believe he's ready to do A2 so soon.

250
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,911
He's not signed on to do A2.

251
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,032
- What?
- He just signed on to do the first one.

252
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,277
- Why is Vince signed for three?
- That's how it works with actors.

253
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,914
Cameron was the reason I did it.
Who's directing?

254
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,551
- Michael Bay.
- Jesus Christ!

255
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,160
- They're just rushing this thing out.
- Listen.

256
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,317
This is what studios do.
The thing is a monster hit.

257
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,351
They're trying to take advantage of it.

258
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,391
- There's no script.
- They're doing it.

259
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,670
- Andrew Kevin Walker?
- Kevin Smith.

260
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,996
- Oh, boy.
- Fuck you, Ari. I want off this movie.

261
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,873
- We'll ask for more dates.
- There are no more dates.

262
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,629
You were there. Alan was nice enough
to give us 65. He didn't have to do that.

263
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,399
- I'm not doing this movie.
- You signed a contract.

264
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,317
I know you are a man of your word.

265
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,193
Oh, yeah? And are you?
Are you a man of your word, Ari?

266
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,515
- I never lied.
- You told me if I did Aquaman,

267
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,199
- I get Medellin.
- You did. I can't help the timing.

268
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,277
I would if I could.
Remember, I don't get paid shit on this.

269
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,151
It all goes to my former employer.

270
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,876
Vinnie, I know that you would kill that role.
I know the timing sucks. But be a man.

271
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,759
- I'll call Haggis, tell him I'm off the movie.
- I'm sorry, Vinnie.

272
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,074
- Just running this shit all day?
- All day.

273
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,634
This keeps up,
get your own channel on Sirius.

274
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,832
Yeah, I got to say. Took you longer than
you promised, man, but you came through.

275
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,472
You ain't seen nothing yet.

276
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,829
Hey, yo, Keshawn, let me get the box, man.

277
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,348
- Yo, you got me a gift?
- Just a little something.

278
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,834
Don't go spending all your money
just yet, man.

279
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,190
- Try it on.
- Yo, I can't accept this.

280
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,994
Don't worry. They're CZs but I plan on
replacing them soon as I can afford it.

281
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,273
That's tight. Thank you.

282
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,477
- Hey, Paul.
- Hey. I couldn't sleep.

283
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,149
I just keep trying to picture this movie
without Vince and I can't do it.

284
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,191
Well, what can we do?

285
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,753
Brainstorm.

286
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,999
I got nothing. Nothing.

287
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,793
You ever consider
cutting out all the flashbacks?

288
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,396
- No.
- Now, this may be retarded,

289
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,839
or maybe I'm just baked,

290
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,917
but you said you wanted Vince
to gain 50 pounds for the part.

291
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,235
70. It's more authentic.

292
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,555
But you need him
skinny for the early years.

293
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,319
- Yeah.
- So you shoot the first half now

294
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,430
before Aquaman 2 while he's skinny.

295
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,278
Shoot the second half
when Vince piles on the pasta.

296
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,118
- Like De Niro in Raging Bull.
- Clooney in Syriana.

297
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,597
Or Johnny Chase in The Commish
when I played that bulimic paedophile.

298
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,757
- Did you see that one, Paul?
- No.

299
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,472
But you know what?

300
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,511
- This could work.
- You think?

301
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,755
- This could fucking work.
- Definitely.

302
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,233
Fuckin' A!

303
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,989
- Good work, E.
- Somebody's gotta make shit happen.

304
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,315
Save one pat on your back for me,
huh, buddy?

305
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,069
You've got to call Alan. Tell him
Vince wants to take him out to dinner.

306
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,315
Our boy is really becoming a man now?

307
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,078
I'll talk to you later, Ari.

308
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,680
Call Alan at Warner.
Set up a dinner for four.

309
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,280
- Today is going to be a big day.
- For you maybe.

310
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,709
Some guy at Atlantic Records
keeps calling.

311
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,832
- What does he want?
- He keeps saying something about Saigon.

312
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,438
Saigon? That's interesting.

313
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,152
- Get him on the phone now.
- OK.

314
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,712
In the hole!
Just like Tiger at Sawgrass.

315
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,069
More like my six-year-old niece at Nunley's.

316
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,237
Are you kidding?
Atlantic Records called you?

317
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,714
- Sony and Interscope too.
- Holy shit!

318
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,877
Anyway, tell Vince and E
eight o'clock at The Palms with Alan.

319
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,275
Eight o'clock at The Palm with Alan.
What else, Ari?

320
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,515
Just make sure they're on time. I gotta go.

321
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,913
- Wait, Ari.
- Yeah, Turtle.

322
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,030
- Are you fucking with me?
- A little bit.

323
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,877
- This is sick, right?
- It is sick.

324
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,354
I'm gonna set up some meetings.

325
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,278
- Your boy's gonna get a deal.
- Holy shit.

326
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,709
I think your life's about to change, Turtle.

327
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,598
- What happened?
- Saigon is gonna get a deal!

328
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,870
Ari just said my life was gonna change.

329
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,751
- Awesome.
- Congratulations.

330
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,791
- Thank you, E.
- Good work.

331
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,037
Vince, thank you so much.
That Big Boy thing put me over the top.

332
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,992
I'm happy for you, bro.
I'm happy for you.

333
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,438
Come to Daddy, sweetie.

334
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,550
She still mad at me?

335
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,114
- No, she's mad at Max now.
- What did he do?

336
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,037
Took a movie in Kazakhstan.

337
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,629
I'm so glad our daughter's tears
make you so happy.

338
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,674
Baby, those tears mean our little girl's
gonna stay our little girl for another day.

339
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,158
Now how about a quick blowjob
before my Vince dinner?

340
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,269
What?

341
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,314
Order whatever you want, Drama. It's on me.

342
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,112
I don't need you to pay for shit of mine.

343
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,232
With Ari on my side,
my life's about to change also.

344
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,470
We had Medellin first over at my studio.

345
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,670
- Really?
- Sure, yeah.

346
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,392
- Let it go.
- Why?

347
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,670
Couldn't budget under 130 days.

348
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,793
I was shocked when you said Haggis was
doing it in 90. Didn't think it was possible.

349
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,434
So you must have thought it impossible
to do it in 65.

350
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,435
So essentially you sent us on a fool's errand?

351
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,596
- Well, a little bit.
- We delivered.

352
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,438
Oh, yes, we did.
And we owe you. Thank you.

353
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,153
Can't let you do it.

354
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,712
- What do you mean?
- Well...

355
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,593
You said if I was back on November 1st...

356
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,918
I've got a billion-dollar franchise to protect.
Happy Meals, action figures.

357
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,829
I can't risk having my Aquaman doing three
hours of blow in every multiplex in the country.

358
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,952
You looked me in the eyes
and said that you'd do this for me.

359
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,230
- You gave me your word.
- I'm sorry.

360
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,592
- Alan, a man is only as good as his word.
- Vince, it's just business. Not personal.

361
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,677
Oh. Just business.

362
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,598
All right, then I want 20 million to do A2
or I quit. Nothing personal.

363
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,270
Sorry, I'm late. Date night with the wife. She
thinks I'm getting popcorn. What did I miss?

364
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,509
English
