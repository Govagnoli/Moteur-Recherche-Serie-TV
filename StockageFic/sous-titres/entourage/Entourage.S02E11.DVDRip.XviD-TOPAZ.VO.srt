1
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,807
Can't sleep?

2
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,002
No, can't sleep.

3
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,411
You miss her,
don't you?

4
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,881
More than words.

5
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,407
It says we're supposed to hug.
I ain't hugging you.

6
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,010
Don't be a wiseass, Turtle.

7
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,987
Just read the lines
like Brooke would.

8
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,923
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Focus.

9
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,051
Radiate, emote.

10
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,221
You know, Brooke Shields
was the first girl

11
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,059
I ever seriously
jerked off to.

12
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,760
That's romantic, Drama.
You should tell her.

13
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,495
Yeah, Lady Fate knew
what she was doing

14
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,264
when she delivered her
to my doorstep.

15
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,295
You're a couple of scenes
on a M.O.W.

16
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,739
It ain't fate and you ain't banging
Brooke Shields.

17
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,006
The on-set romance is
a time-honored Hollywood tradition.

18
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,569
- Wake up!
- Ain't she married?

19
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,672
Yeah, to a writer.

20
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:58,149
I mean, come on.
Me or a writer?

21
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,118
All right, guys, Let's roll!

22
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,553
We don't want to be late
showing up at Terrance's.

23
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,114
Oh, check it out.
E's got the shiny hair again.

24
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,286
- Hopin' Sloan will be there?
- Sloan doesn't live with her father,

25
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,956
- but I am having dinner with her.
- Nice.

26
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:13,397
- Don't mention that to Terrance.
- Why, is it a secret?

27
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,663
We're meeting with the head
of your agency for your business,

28
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:18,967
- not my personal life. Let's go.
- All right.

29
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,235
What time did you roll in
last night, Vince?

30
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:24,243
- Yeah, late night, huh?
- What, did I break curfew?

31
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:27,269
Look, if you guys have a question,
why don't you just ask it?

32
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,373
Okay, what the fuck's going
on with you and Mandy?

33
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,010
- Yeah, what's up, Vince?
- I didn't know you guys cared.

34
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:35,384
- Come on!
- All right.

35
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,616
Mandy broke up with Chris,
now we're together.

36
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,488
And I'm happy,
so don't give me any shit.

37
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,585
Tomorrow's her birthday,
I gotta do something special.

38
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:44,096
It's been 24 hours.
I think flowers will do.

39
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,655
You should have started
dating her next week, bro.

40
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,394
You could've saved
yourself some coin.

41
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,834
I remember I broke up
with Stacy Laruzso

42
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,735
a week before Valentine's Day.

43
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,239
I got back with her
a week after.

44
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,367
No chocolates, no roses.

45
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,899
No class.

46
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,809
Pull!

47
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,973
Good shot.

48
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,544
I can already see E hanging
in the den next to the elk.

49
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,885
Attention to details, Vince,

50
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,585
that's the sure-fire way
into any woman's heart.

51
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,991
You know, when I was courting
Ann-Margaret

52
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,792
I used fly in truffles
from her favorite bistro in Avignon.

53
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,765
Fly in some steaks from Peter Luger's,
Vince. If nothing else,

54
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,200
- I'll love you forever.
- Well, actually, Turtle,

55
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,535
I was going to suggest
a private little dinner party

56
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,133
at my restaurant.
My treat, of course.

57
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:31,803
That's sounds great.
Is it cool if I invite the guys?

58
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,074
I'd love Mandy
to meet the family,

59
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:37,014
- maybe take her to Napa for a weekend.
- Absolutely.

60
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,178
What? You don't like Napa
or you don't want to get to know Mandy?

61
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,450
Hey, maybe I'll bring Brooke.

62
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:45,980
Get to know her so that we feel
comfortable for our love scene.

63
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,016
The more the merrier, Johnny.

64
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,121
Now, are you guys just gonna stand here
or are you gonna shoot?

65
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,257
First up,
the North Hollywood

66
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,063
Paintball Tournament
M.V.P. Three years running!

67
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,332
Whose whole family's
of Sicilian ancestry?

68
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,737
Your grandmother ran numbers
out of a deli, Turtle.

69
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,070
You're far from a made man.

70
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,372
- Yeah, we'll see.
- Pull!

71
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,538
- Yeah!
- I got that!

72
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,548
- That was mine!
- I totally got that!

73
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,608
- That was clearly my shot.
- You saw that?

74
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,951
You know, you're a natural
with a gun, Vince.

75
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,650
You should be working
with Tarantino.

76
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,659
I'd love to. I've been wanting to meet
him since I moved out here.

77
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,718
Really?

78
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,162
- How about next week?
- Seriously?

79
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,996
Most assuredly.
Quentin's an old mate of mine.

80
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,502
Who do you think pulled him out
of that bloody video store?

81
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,561
Yeah, Vince, let's do
a Tarantino movie.

82
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,573
He could revive me
like he did for Travolta.

83
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,337
Be more like reviving
Freddie Boom Boom Washington.

84
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:41,507
Listen, Vincent, I've got over 30 years
experience in this business,

85
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,674
and the Rolodex
that goes with it.

86
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,707
All of which are now
at your disposal.

87
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:49,449
There are no boundaries,
just possibilities.

88
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,916
Excuse me.

89
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,860
- What's up, Shauna?
- What are you so chipper about?

90
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,886
I just had a great day
shooting with Terrance.

91
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,660
- Don't put your guns away just yet.
- Why, what's the problem?

92
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,101
"Page Six" just outed
Vince and Mandy. Bang-bang.

93
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,600
"What soon-to-be super actor
gets along so swimmingly

94
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,304
with his engaged co-star that friends
say her pending nuptials are drowning?"

95
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,142
- How can you let this happen?
- Me?

96
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,977
- Yeah.
- He's the one doing the swimming.

97
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:19,041
It's your job to make sure what he does
stays out of the papers.

98
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,451
- I thought that was her job.
- It's your job to let me know

99
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,149
what needs to be kept out,
then I'll keep it out of the papers!

100
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,090
A little less time
on the firing range,

101
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,252
a little more time
as a manager, perhaps.

102
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,592
What did you and Terrance
talk about anyway?

103
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,066
He offered me your job. I turned him
down 'cause your office is too small.

104
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,331
Guys, what am I doing here?
I feel like I have a coke problem.

105
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,997
What's the real issue, Ari?

106
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,064
The real issue is that
Dana Gordon called

107
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,167
and Warner Brothers
is very concerned.

108
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,711
You're kidding, right?

109
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,306
You're their million dollar baby!
They don't want you pulling

110
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,283
- an Angelina Jolie!
- Or a Russell Crowe.

111
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,877
He broke up Dennis Quaid
and Meg Ryan on "Proof of Life."

112
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,946
Movie cost 80 mil,
did less business than "Gigli."

113
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,923
Guys, relax.

114
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,518
Mandy's not even engaged
anymore. They broke up.

115
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,428
And you're gonna come off
as the reason for that.

116
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,558
The last thing we need is soccer moms
in the fly-over states

117
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,795
thinking that Aquaman
is a home wrecker.

118
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,566
I had a good time last time.
I'd love to have dinner with him.

119
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:15,631
I just don't want to get stuck
with the bill again.

120
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,235
- Is that the husband?
- Huh?

121
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,711
Brooke's husband,
is that him over there?

122
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,477
Oh, I don't know.

123
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,609
Not good looking.

124
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,181
I'm not saying
don't date her.

125
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,714
I'm just saying
be discreet.

126
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,454
No hand-holding
at The Grove.

127
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,520
- No canoodling on Melrose.
- Canoodling?

128
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,929
No fingerbanging
her courtside at the Lakers game.

129
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,831
- What?
- Fuck you guys!

130
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:45,360
I'm making a point here... No cameras.
A "Page Six" rumor is one thing.

131
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,100
Cover of "Us Weekly"
quite another.

132
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,233
- We get it. Jesus!
- Do you get it, E?

133
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,903
When he goes out, I want you
and the retards to be with him.

134
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,970
If anyone tries to take a picture you,
go fucking Sean Penn on them.

135
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,141
Hey, when did you get
this Robert Neitsch?

136
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,650
Good eye.
I just hung her.

137
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,584
- And it's Nitch, by the way.
- Really?

138
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,021
I paid for it with Eva Longoria's
commission. That's how I roll.

139
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:07,253
- Nitch is Mandy's favorite artist.
- I thought Beyonce was.

140
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,456
Don't be mean to Mandy just because
you're mad at me.

141
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:13,590
Ari, will you let me
buy this painting for Mandy's birthday?

142
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,033
- Are you nuts?
- Maybe.

143
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,366
- What do you say?
- Are you serious?

144
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,838
- Yeah, how much?
- It's $100,000...

145
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,569
- E, talk to your boy, please.
- For you?

146
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,804
Why? Terrance would
sell it to him.

147
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,541
Shit, he'd probably give it to him.
That's how I roll.

148
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,516
Lloyd, you were
an Art History major

149
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,883
- at Sarah Lawrence College, right?
- Yes, I was.

150
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,081
Then you know how to pull
this down off the wall.

151
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,488
Grab it and put it down in Vinnie's car.
Chop-chop!

152
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,652
- You feeling the love?
- How much? $100,000?

153
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:45,186
For you? Mmm, free. Think of it
as a start gift for "Aquaman."

154
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,667
You gave me a juice maker for "Queens
Boulevard." We must be moving up.

155
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,931
Like the goddamn Jeffersons.
Come here.

156
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,901
Tell Terrance to top that,
little man.

157
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,066
So Brooke looked
at you, huh, Drama?

158
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,600
You know what?
To hell with you guys.

159
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,273
I know when I'm vibing.
Me and Brooke, we're vibing.

160
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,283
- Hello, Kathy.
- Hey, Vince.

161
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,945
- Just four.
- Uh, no, there's gonna be five.

162
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,954
- There is?
- Yeah, Mandy's joining us.

163
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,889
We're supposed to lay low.
What if somebody takes a picture?

164
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,950
E, relax.
This is Jerry's, not The Ivy.

165
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,621
Do you see any paparazzi?

166
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,960
You never know where
these scumbags are hiding.

167
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,434
These guys are right. Why do you think
I always sit next to you in restaurants?

168
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,959
- Just in case.
- All right, take it easy.

169
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,871
- I want to enjoy my tuna melt.
- We're worried about you.

170
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,070
Yeah, Vince. We don't wanna see
this girl crush you again.

171
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,874
All right, guys, stop it.
Here she is.

172
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,346
Now, be nice.

173
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,906
- Especially you, E.
- I'm always nice.

174
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,578
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

175
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,555
No kiss, no kiss.
I just got an earful from my publicist.

176
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,284
- You, too, huh?
- Good.

177
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,986
- Let's keep you guys separated.
- Ah, you must be E.

178
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,757
I've heard so much about you.
It's nice to finally meet you.

179
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,320
You too.

180
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,765
You look cute.

181
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,064
Really?
I just got out of the gym.

182
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,663
Still cute.

183
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,196
So... how are you guys?

184
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,833
It's been a while.

185
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,309
Everything good, Johnny?

186
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,312
I'm doing an M.O.W.
With Brooke Shields.

187
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,973
Couldn't be better.

188
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,882
Great! What about you, Turtle?

189
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,818
Oh, just working hard,
you know?

190
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,792
Well, how nice is this?
All us together.

191
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,594
Wow, he's good.

192
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,736
All right, she's great.
What do you want me to say?

193
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,264
That's all I want
you to say.

194
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,106
She thinks
you're great, too.

195
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,840
You left her two seconds ago,
you're texting her already?

196
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,279
Nuts, huh?

197
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,545
- Have you ever seen me like this?
- No.

198
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,052
Oh, I'm in deep.

199
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,884
- After one day?
- No, not one day!

200
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,288
We look at it like we've been
dating for five years

201
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,259
with a four-and-half-year break.

202
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:57,285
What? Like of all people
you don't know that feeling?

203
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,662
No, I know it.
I know it. I still think

204
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,633
- you should cancel the dinner.
- Why?

205
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,830
Because Jerry's Deli is one thing,
all right? The Geisha House

206
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,566
is completely different.
There's gonna be paparazzi there.

207
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,542
I've never let the press control
my life, I'm not gonna start now.

208
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:12,737
This whole movie
could fall apart. You heard Ari.

209
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,712
What's the real problem here?

210
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,510
Come on, E,
don't hold back!

211
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,540
I think it's a little
much after one day!

212
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:21,553
This girl dumped you!
She turned down your marriage proposal.

213
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,418
You don't really know
the story.

214
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,482
I know she dumped her fiance three weeks
before the wedding.

215
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,857
Look, she just doesn't
sound stable.

216
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,862
I don't know
about you either lately.

217
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,659
You've known me
almost 25 years.

218
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:35,724
If you can't get this then maybe
you shouldn't come to the party.

219
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,362
- Maybe I shouldn't.
- No, I don't think you should.

220
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,669
- Fine.
- Okay, everybody. Thanks for coming.

221
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,175
Sorry, we haven't gotten
the scripts to you earlier,

222
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,576
but we were working into
the wee hours making it sing.

223
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,773
- Look at that hair.
- I'm out.

224
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,409
Also, unfortunately,
Joe Mantegna has dropped out.

225
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:55,648
We're gonna be great.
We're gonna be great.

226
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,020
We're gonna get started
in just a second.

227
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,994
Hey, pal.

228
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,429
- The A.D. S want a word with you.
- About what?

229
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,942
- Hi.
- Hi.

230
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,409
- Johnny.
- Brooke.

231
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,469
I know who you are.

232
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,778
I'm playing Little Rick. We've got
a couple of nice scenes together.

233
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,410
- Yeah, it should be fun.
- Yeah.

234
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:31,513
- You know what time it is?
- Oh, sorry, no watch.

235
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:35,220
Yeah, I noticed you
don't wear any jewelry.

236
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,559
No, I never really have.

237
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:41,054
Yeah, me neither.
No watch, no bracelet, no ring.

238
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,658
Oh.

239
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,194
I just wanted to run something by you
before I pitch it to the director.

240
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,604
Sure. What is it?

241
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,201
- In the comforting scene...
- Yeah.

242
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,939
I thought that maybe
a little kiss might add some pathos.

243
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,675
- A kiss?
- Yeah, nothing crazy.

244
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,650
More in love than lust.

245
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,549
You're playing my brother.

246
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,788
Really? I didn't even
get a full script.

247
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:08,055
Your brother.
That would be weird.

248
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,085
Yeah.

249
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,188
So, what do you say
we save the kiss?

250
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,960
Okay.

251
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,399
- Okay.
- Rain check it is.

252
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,771
So, your dad is pretty
good with a gun.

253
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,672
- You should see him with a crossbow.
- You serious?

254
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,505
Oh, yeah. He's great
with all weapons.

255
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,636
And he's even better
with his bare knuckles.

256
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,512
Really? Was he on the boxing
team at Oxford or something?

257
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,244
Oxford? No.

258
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,912
You have the wrong idea
about my father.

259
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,149
- He didn't even finish high school.
- Really?

260
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,157
I can't believe that.
He seems so polished.

261
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,386
You don't have
to be afraid of him.

262
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,090
Oh, I know. Why would I be afraid
of a bare-knuckle brawler

263
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,463
who's proficient
in all weapons?

264
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,094
- He likes you.
- Really?

265
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,730
He barely acknowledged me
at skeet shooting.

266
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,240
That's 'cause he knows
that I like you.

267
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:02,172
- Did he say anything about the party?
- Nope.

268
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,446
Should I say something
to him?

269
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,078
Nope.

270
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,714
All right. He said
you disinvited him.

271
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:13,020
I didn't disinvite him.

272
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,958
Well, that's what he said.

273
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,929
He called me unstable.

274
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,098
You have been acting
a little unstably, Vin.

275
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,539
You want me
to reinvite him to the party?

276
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,701
Yeah.
No, only if he asks.

277
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,303
Real mature.

278
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,215
Yo. "Blue Lagoon,"
"Endless Love,"

279
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,150
"Muppets Take Manhattan."

280
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:43,781
- It's gonna be Brooke marathon.
- Great!

281
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,054
All I can tell you is that in the year
I was out of town

282
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,083
Vince slept with almost
all of my friends.

283
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:52,120
And he never told any of them
he was in love, so maybe he is.

284
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,997
Yeah, well I don't know
why he's lying to me for.

285
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:58,060
Guys lie to their friends
and tell them that they're not in love.

286
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,230
They don't usually lie
and tell them they are.

287
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,035
That lie they save
for the girls.

288
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,372
He's certainly acting
crazy enough.

289
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,277
Did I tell you he got her a Robert Nitch
painting for her birthday?

290
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,781
- A Robert Neitsch?
- Is it Neitsch?

291
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:12,409
- Ari said Nitch.
- It's Neitsch.

292
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:16,114
And, wow!
He bought her a Robert Neitsch?

293
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,020
That's really expensive.

294
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:21,185
Actually, Ari pulled it off the wall
and gave it to him, but still...

295
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,923
- Oh my God.
- What's so funny?

296
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:28,397
- It's a fake.
- What do you mean?

297
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:31,562
I mean, Ari's notorious
for hanging forgeries

298
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,435
in his office
to impress his clients.

299
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,872
- Oh, please tell me you're kidding.
- No.

300
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,069
And I don't know
if it's true,

301
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,170
but my father told me
he changed the numbers

302
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,078
on his wife's Mercedes

303
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:46,482
so she thinks she's driving around
in a 600, and really it's a five.

304
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:49,112
- Oh, that's crazy.
- Yeah.

305
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:52,783
What's crazy is to fight
with your best friend over a girl,

306
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,953
especially a girl you're not
even interested in.

307
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,497
You should go
to the party.

308
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,760
You should go with me.

309
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,564
I would love to.

310
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,174
Looking for an exchange?

311
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,476
Something like that.

312
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,607
I smell trouble.

313
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,287
The unannounced drop-by, huh?

314
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,118
You making a habit
of this, E?

315
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,714
You're not gonna believe this.

316
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,124
Vince got offered $300,000
for this painting.

317
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,787
He wants to sell it.

318
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,955
It was a gift.
Come on, that would be rude.

319
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,625
Yeah, but he's gonna split
the profits with you.

320
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,931
I'm not in the art game
for the profits.

321
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,630
I'm in it for the love
of the work.

322
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,273
I know it's a fake, Ari.

323
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,040
- Cut the bullshit.
- It's a fake?

324
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,012
So, I'm giving out
fake paintings?

325
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,517
Do you want to see
the certificate of authenticity?

326
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,143
Yeah, I do.

327
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,453
Define the term
fake, Eric.

328
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,449
Because three years ago
Vincent Chase sat in this office,

329
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:06,157
shook my hand and told
me I was his agent. Was that a fake?

330
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,133
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about

331
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,966
the Quentin-motherfucking-
Tarantino meeting

332
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,904
that was set up outside
of this office.

333
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:17,340
Terrance works inside this office.
He's your boss.

334
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,640
If you guys have a problem,
then you figure it out.

335
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:23,580
But Vince isn't gonna pass on a Quentin
Tarantino meeting that you couldn't get.

336
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,583
It's a jerkoff general!

337
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:28,142
My six-year-old could get
that meeting!

338
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,451
Your six-year-old could have
painted this shit, too!

339
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,083
Tarantino is
probably holed up

340
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,753
in a Vegas penthouse
with half a dozen Thai hookers

341
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,695
writing his next script
which no one has seen!

342
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,291
For all we know,
he's probably writing about Wu Tzu Chi

343
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,301
the lesbian empress
of the Ming dynasty!

344
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,565
You want Vince to play
a dictator dyke?

345
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,094
If it's a good role.

346
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,130
Come on, man!

347
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,971
I'm not gonna argue
with you, Ari.

348
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,807
I'm on my way
to an art appraiser.

349
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,813
Care to stop me?

350
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,372
Does Vince know
about this?

351
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,207
No.

352
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,914
But I might tell your wife
she's driving around in a 500.

353
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,183
You better fucking
fix this, Ari.

354
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,955
Before the party.

355
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,126
Hey, buddy, don't mind me.
Just be a minute.

356
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,834
Um, what are you doing?

357
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,437
Hanging some sheetrock.
What does it look like I'm doing?

358
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,811
That's my anniversary present.

359
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,873
No, honey.

360
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,917
This is.

361
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,353
And, action!

362
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,226
Couldn't sleep?

363
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,759
You miss her,
don't you?

364
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,462
Yeah, more than words.

365
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,573
She's in a better place.

366
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,075
It's okay.

367
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,272
It's okay.

368
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,181
It's okay.

369
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,661
He's hard.

370
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,694
- What?
- He is hard.

371
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,602
- Cut! Cut!
- Cutting!

372
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,682
- Why does he have my painting?
- I don't know.

373
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,850
- Well, what did he say?
- He said he'll be here.

374
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,587
- When?
- I don't know, Vince.

375
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,061
This is a '59 Latour

376
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,223
from my private collection.

377
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,825
That ought
to do the trick.

378
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,837
Look, John,
even Hillary Swank

379
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,499
got fired from
"Beverly Hills 90210."

380
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,940
Paul Giamatti was let
go on "Frasier."

381
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,410
I was actually fired
from a TV show

382
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,743
- that will remain nameless.
- "Roswell"?

383
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,374
I never had a job, sorry.

384
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,510
The point is that everyone
gets fired sometimes.

385
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,021
It's what you do afterwards
that counts.

386
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:20,923
Yeah, but to fire me just because
I wasn't attracted to her.

387
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,950
That's callous.

388
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:28,025
- Hit me again.
- Bring the Kendall Jackson.

389
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,658
Cork the '59.

390
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:34,368
Well, Vince,
enjoy the rest of the evening.

391
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:37,432
I have to get home
to my 18-month-old son Beckett.

392
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,809
He has a happy knack
of waking me at 4:30 in the morning.

393
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,144
- Happy birthday, darling.
- Thank you.

394
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,015
- Thank you, Terrance.
- Hey, cheer up.

395
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,110
- Thank you, Terrance.
- Good night.

396
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,883
Guess it just wasn't
meant to be, Drama.

397
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,414
- Sorry, Johnny.
- Vin.

398
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,825
Well, look what
we have here.

399
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,160
We were about to start
hanging signs on trees.

400
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,031
"Miniature Irish Setter.
Answers to the name of E."

401
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:05,161
I'm sorry, guys.
It's totally my fault.

402
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,934
I was having a major
fashion disaster.

403
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,635
- Happy birthday, sweetie!
- Thank you.

404
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:14,237
- You two know each other?
- Yeah, from Barry's Bootcamp.

405
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,144
Uh, let's get a drink.

406
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,046
Yeah, let's do that.

407
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,252
I thought you sold it
and moved to Mexico.

408
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,015
I just had it detailed.

409
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,485
So, are you gonna stay
for dinner?

410
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,720
Yeah, I'm staying
for dinner.

411
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,525
Open mine next.
Open mine next.

412
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,970
I feel so bad. You guys did not have
to get me gifts.

413
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,804
Oh, we wanted to.
Maybe you'll wanna get us gifts

414
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:47,676
when our birthdays roll around,
say August 6th?

415
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,910
"Viking Quest:
The Complete Series."

416
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,814
That's from both of us.

417
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,682
Thank you. Cool!

418
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,188
- I'll sign that for you if you want.
- Me too.

419
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,884
All right, my turn.

420
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,587
I've been wondering
what that was all night.

421
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:06,155
Hopefully this will make up for the last
birthday we spent together.

422
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:09,190
Unless you ran her dog over,
I'm guessing it might.

423
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,395
Oh my God.

424
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,099
That's real too.

425
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,734
Vince, you are crazy.

426
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,075
I can't believe
that you did this.

427
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,910
The second I saw it
I knew you had to have it.

428
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,178
How did you remember
that I love Neitsch?

429
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,152
I remember everything about you.
And it's Nitch.

430
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:29,881
No, it's not.

431
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,387
It's Neitsch.

432
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,689
You guys, l...

433
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,021
I just... I really
want to thank you

434
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,191
so much for being
a part of tonight.

435
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:44,066
I really forgot what
a family you guys are.

436
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,696
I'm just very happy.

437
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,366
- To family!
- To Mandy!

438
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,000
To Mandy and Vince!

439
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,341
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
