1
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:09,172
Daddy, I'm leaving.

2
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,335
But you won't even
let me finish.

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,537
Sweetheart, please don't go. Not like this.

4
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:18,376
Paige, I promise you,
there's nothing wrong with my baby girl.

5
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,443
I'm not a baby. And I'm not your girl.

6
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,148
Paige....
Don't touch me.

7
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:26,351
God, have you ever considered
that nothing happened?

8
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,486
That this is all just
a figment of your imagination?

9
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:32,187
I give myself more credit than that.

10
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,459
Because pretty soon,
the truth is gonna come out.

11
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,660
And when it does,
I can promise you one thing.

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,295
I'm not the only one
who's gonna have to deal with it.

13
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,896
<i>You are, Daddy. </i>

14
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,536
Paige!

15
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,184
Okay, hotshot. Bonus question.
You ready?

16
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:55,243
Hit me.

17
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:59,781
Riddle me this: The odontoid ligaments
serve to limit the extent to which?

18
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,690
The cranium's rotation can be carried...

19
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:04,161
which is why they're also known as
check ligaments.

20
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,494
- You gonna eat that?
- It's all yours, smarty- pants.

21
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,194
I am finished with
cramming for your MCATs.

22
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,291
Davis, come on.

23
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,997
We haven't even started
on the sympathetic nervous system.

24
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,074
You know the secret for acing the MCATs?

25
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,837
Quit cramming. Get some sleep.
Go home, Tru.

26
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,242
I'm just so excited.

27
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:22,008
If I ace the MCATs tomorrow,
I get into medical school.

28
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,606
I do that, I become a doctor.

29
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:26,743
And if I become a doctor,
I can finally say goodbye....

30
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,412
To working here?

31
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,016
Come on, I didn't mean it like that.

32
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,755
Don't worry.
I got a feeling it's not gonna happen.

33
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,457
You think I won't pass?
I nailed every question you asked.

34
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:39,793
Plus the ones you made up.

35
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:43,302
No, that's not what I meant.
I'm sure you'll ace them.

36
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,996
I just meant that...

37
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,597
sometimes I get the feeling that
some people don't belong here.

38
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,305
And some people do.

39
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,703
So which am I? I belong here or not?

40
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,478
What do you think?

41
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,507
Help me!

42
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:12,682
Hello?

43
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,420
Bitch Cakes. Hey, it's Lindsay.

44
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,859
I guessed.

45
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,327
So listen. I found a guy.

46
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,593
I'm shocked.
<i>Not for me. For you. </i>

47
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,363
His name's Jeremy.
I haven't met him, but he's your type.

48
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,029
If you've never met him,
how do you know he's my type?

49
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,835
Tru, it's my gift.
So stop asking questions...

50
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:31,570
and start looking for that
black Dolce & Gabbana dress...

51
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:32,668
I got you last Christmas.

52
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,144
Lindsay, we've been through this.

53
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,547
I'm not on the market,
and I'm taking my MCATs this afternoon.

54
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,141
<i>Perfect. You'II meet him after. </i>

55
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,985
And don't worry, I'll be there to chaperone,
so now you're all out of excuses.

56
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,649
<i>Say you'II be there. </i>
I'll be there.

57
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:46,747
<i>Smart girI. </i>

58
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,851
Good luck on your test.
<i>Thanks. </i>

59
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:02,135
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you look like crap.

60
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,573
Thanks, Harrison. Very sweet.

61
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:09,046
I told you I've been up studying all night,
because in 45 minutes...

62
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,617
I'm gonna take the biggest test of my life.

63
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,710
- Right. The Top Cats.
- MCATs.

64
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,453
I just want to know you're okay.

65
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,086
Outside the big test jitters,
I'm fine, thanks.

66
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,857
Is everything else copasetic?
Feeling good? Having fun?

67
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,400
Look, you know me.
I'm always looking out for you.

68
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,969
Because I know you'd do
the same thing for me.

69
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:34,268
- All right, what do you want?
- Nothing, man. What?

70
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,171
A guy can't worry about his own sister...

71
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,710
without being
accused of working an angle?

72
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:42,178
Jeez. I'm offended.
How could you actually say that to me?

73
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,182
It's about what I told you, isn't it?

74
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,913
About me....You know, what I can do.

75
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,745
Okay. A: I don't even believe you.

76
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:55,021
And B: Even if I did,
I would still need some cold, hard...

77
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:58,289
proof.

78
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,922
The racing form?

79
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,557
You want me to believe you, right?

80
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:05,104
<i>WeII, here's a way. </i>
<i>I go to the track, I see who wins. </i>

81
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,866
I call you up on the phone,
tell you the horses' names...

82
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:12,377
and tomorrow should you, you know,
do that voodoo you do so well....

83
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,913
- You make money.
- Yeah.

84
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,972
Harrison, I don't think that's how it works.

85
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,711
I'm not even sure it works at all.

86
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:22,812
But I've heard of weirder systems,
so I say, what the hell, give it a shot.

87
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:28,221
Are you down with this,
or do I have to go work for a living?

88
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,987
I'll see what I can do. But now I gotta go.

89
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,327
I love my sister.

90
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:37,597
Go. Go take your MCATs.
Kick much academic ass.

91
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:39,204
Thanks.

92
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,395
Time.

93
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,204
Time's up, people. Pencils down.

94
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:28,549
To my best friend, Tru,
who just aced her MCATs...

95
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,249
and who will make
a wonderful doctor someday.

96
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,087
- Cheers.
- I'm not done yet.

97
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,026
And who will always squeeze me in
on short notice...

98
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,995
and accept
whatever health insurance I carry.

99
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,259
- Of course.
- Okay. Cheers.

100
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,937
Is that him?
It's gotta be.

101
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,773
God, can I pick them, or can I pick them?

102
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,679
Hey, Jeremy?
Yes.

103
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:57,909
Hi.

104
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,287
Jeremy.
That's me.

105
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:07,816
But you can't be Tru,
you're too good to be true.

106
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:12,658
Yeah, my name does lend itself
to more obvious puns.

107
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,724
I spent all day thinking that up.
Do you mind?

108
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:26,234
I don't usually go on blind dates.
Who knows what you're gonna get?

109
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:29,406
<i>So at first I was aII, Iike, wait, </i>
<i>she works in a morgue? </i>

110
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,815
'Cause I mean, come on,
you're too hot to work in a morgue.

111
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,011
You ought to switch jobs.

112
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,577
You ought to be in, like,
videos or something.

113
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:40,558
- I have to go.
- Right. Night shift. Creepy.

114
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,656
So, I'll call you.

115
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,094
Wait, you forgot to give me your number.

116
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:03,238
- Luc. Hi.
- Hi.

117
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,482
- Have we met?
- Yeah.

118
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,588
In the we've- never- actually- met
kind of way.

119
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:13,218
I heard there might be a new guy.

120
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,817
That would be me. Luc.

121
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,985
Tru.

122
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,761
- Dress code?
- Blind date.

123
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,560
Bad one.

124
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,865
Well, is there any other kind?

125
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:31,173
My friend, Lindsay,
thinks it's her life's work to fix me up.

126
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,076
She worried you can't meet a nice guy?

127
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:36,580
Worried I can't meet a living one.

128
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,745
She shouldn't worry.

129
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,747
- I mean....
- Why? Know someone for me?

130
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,984
Give me some time.

131
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,453
Anyway, I gotta run.

132
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,621
My folks are in town,
but it's nice to meet you.

133
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:51,989
Yeah.

134
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,156
Tru.

135
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,158
Luc.

136
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,267
Hello?
<i>Hey, it's me. </i>

137
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,907
And I hold in my hands
the key to financial freedom.

138
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,278
A job application?
<i>That's very funny. </i>

139
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,944
But no.

140
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:15,010
What I have are the winning horses
from the last race at Del Mar.

141
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,145
Great.

142
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,588
<i>It's a 40- to- 1 trifecta, Tru. </i>

143
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,387
So write this down.

144
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,253
Today's lucky ponies are...

145
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:26,765
Cherry Top, Sky Marker, and Whirligig.

146
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,629
You know, I have no idea
why I can do what I do...

147
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,670
but I'm pretty sure
it's not so I can pick the ponies.

148
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,730
<i>TeII me you got them. </i>
I got them, okay, you happy?

149
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,105
No. But I will be tomorrow...

150
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,907
if my big sister's
as lucky as she claims to be.

151
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,180
I gotta go. I love you.

152
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:44,340
Tru?

153
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,078
I didn't hear you come in.
Hi.

154
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,950
I meant to tell you,
you got a call from County Records today.

155
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,115
Something about
an autopsy report you requested.

156
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:55,455
Yeah, my mother's.

157
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,224
Stupid.

158
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,590
- Is there a problem?
- I'm sorry.

159
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,602
Had I known,
I would've authorized delivery.

160
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:08,605
- But since I didn't know, I just didn't--
- It's okay. I'll get them tomorrow.

161
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:09,663
No, not likely.

162
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,744
The clerk went on vacation tonight
for a couple of weeks.

163
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,404
<i>With aII the red tape downtown...</i>

164
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,573
you'll probably have to wait
till he gets back.

165
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:21,086
It's okay. I've waited ten years.
Another few weeks won't kill me, right?

166
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,854
Still, I can't help but wonder...

167
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,791
if those are the answers
you're really looking for.

168
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:29,820
Why, what are you--

169
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,487
We got a cold one.

170
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,065
The name's Paige Sanders.
Medical student at Hudson.

171
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,070
Well, until 4:31 today.

172
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,002
Hudson? That's the top medical school
in the state.

173
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,009
Didn't do her any good.

174
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,376
How'd she die?
Here's a guess.

175
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:51,276
Knowing the high- pressure world
of most med students...

176
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,875
I would posit this one worked hard.

177
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,386
But apparently played
a wee bit harder.

178
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:59,720
Overdose? God, that makes no sense.

179
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,460
<i>Hudson gets their pick of the best</i>
<i>and the brightest. She had it aII. </i>

180
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,553
What can I tell you?

181
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,495
Some students
can hack the pressure.

182
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,089
And some can't.

183
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:09,835
Yeah, but why would she--

184
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:13,871
Never met a newbie as curious as you.
Relax. You can't help her now.

185
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,708
Come on, Davis,
what more can you tell me?

186
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,970
It looks like we have
a little petechial imaging in the eye.

187
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,039
<i>UsuaIIy associated</i>
<i>with some sort of trauma. </i>

188
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,414
Could be a side effect of the drug intake.

189
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,283
Coughing, vomiting,
internal pressure of some kind.

190
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,585
Wow. Someone's gonna do well
on their MCATs.

191
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:32,749
<i>That's good. </i>

192
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:36,955
Just to be sure, we should prepare
the body for a toxicology report.

193
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:41,261
I want to know exactly what chemicals
were in the student's body when she died.

194
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,096
Hey, wait up, Davis.

195
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,065
You have no idea how lucky you were.

196
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,239
Save me.

197
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,254
Hello?

198
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,324
Bitch Cakes. Hey, it's Lindsay.

199
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,196
<i>Too tired to taIk? Okay, fine. </i>

200
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:21,364
<i>'Cause I found a guy. His name's Jeremy. </i>

201
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,031
And he's totally your type.

202
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,391
Good morning.

203
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,056
You ever have, like,
one of the greatest days of your life?

204
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,325
I mean, a really truly great day...

205
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,231
and then just feel like
the whole thing got erased?

206
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,268
You're assuming
I've ever had a great day?

207
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:55,239
What are you doing?
I'm just checking for something.

208
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,037
Hey, did we get any
medical students last night?

209
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,271
The only medical student here is you
in a couple of hours.

210
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,373
- Aren't you taking the MCATs today?
- I did.

211
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,108
I will. I just have to do one thing first.

212
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,453
You have quite the life, don't you?

213
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,388
Unfortunately, yeah.

214
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:17,095
And, Davis,
if County Records just happens to call...

215
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:20,291
go ahead and authorize the delivery.
I want those files.

216
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,196
My God, Luc, I'm sorry.
Here, let me help you.

217
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,466
No, thanks. Really. I got it.

218
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,038
Tell me it's fixable.

219
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,577
Well, I would.
But then I'd probably be lying.

220
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,108
How did you know my name?

221
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,174
What?

222
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:43,779
You called me Luc just now,
but we've never met before.

223
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,619
I'm a lucky guesser.

224
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,349
Yeah, well...

225
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,128
nice running into you.

226
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,266
Tell me this day gets better.

227
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,015
Check again. My records have to be here.

228
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,019
Are you sure you're using
that thing right?

229
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,125
Hello?
<i>Tru? Where are you? </i>

230
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,823
Oh, God. Harrison, breakfast.

231
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,695
Why did you blow me off?
I've been waiting half an hour.

232
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:31,793
It's not my fault.
I'm having one of those mornings.

233
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,169
So, you're telling me what?

234
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,435
We already had this conversation?

235
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,935
Do you have the racing form
in front of you?

236
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,273
It proves nothing.

237
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:43,338
Except that if you're having
one of your so- called lucky days...

238
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,248
you should be telling me
today's winning horses.

239
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,785
I don't remember.

240
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,043
What?

241
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:53,158
They were horse things.
How am I supposed to remember them?

242
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,626
You know, you talk a good game,
but I knew you couldn't do it, Tru.

243
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,458
<i>I knew it. See you. </i>

244
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,557
It's Hansen. Jessica Hansen.

245
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:06,163
The transfer should've come in hours ago
from Harvard Medical.

246
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,431
I'll be sure to let you know
the moment they come in.

247
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,939
You do that.

248
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,547
Hi.

249
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,873
Just a thought,
but when her files come in...

250
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,418
you should bounce them back
to Harvard just for laughs.

251
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,454
Don't give me any ideas.

252
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,645
What can I do for you?

253
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,748
My friend, Paige Sanders, is a student.

254
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:29,692
I want to surprise her.
Do you know where I can find her now?

255
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,322
- I'm not allowed to say.
- I get that.

256
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,390
Too bad, though.

257
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,491
She just got a residency
at the Mayo Clinic...

258
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,695
and I'd love to see the look
on Harvard's face...

259
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,865
when she learns my friend got in
and she didn't.

260
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,740
Goddard Building, Theater C.

261
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:50,441
- But you didn't hear it from me.
- Didn't hear what from you?

262
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:57,313
Mr. Taggert, would you tell
your fellow surgeons in training...

263
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:01,120
what exactly you're doing
to this poor dead man's heart?

264
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,718
Like you taught, sir...

265
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,320
I'm just making a cut
between the inferior vena cava....

266
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,831
And the what? Anyone?

267
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,898
Eustachian valve.
Good.

268
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,665
Taking particular care not to sever....

269
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,807
Miss Sanders?

270
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,200
<i>Name's Paige Sanders. </i>

271
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,300
Save me.

272
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,277
Miss Sanders?
The....

273
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,476
Anterior margin.

274
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,377
The....

275
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,013
The answer I'm looking for
is the anterior margin.

276
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,647
Right. No, and I knew that. I just--

277
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,851
We all knew the answer, Miss Sanders.

278
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,793
The question is time. Time matters.

279
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:40,263
<i>To us, time is the difference</i>
<i>between Iife and death. </i>

280
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:44,200
Time has value, Miss Sanders.
And please do not waste our time.

281
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,834
<i>For those of us</i>
<i>who may actuaIIy become doctors...</i>

282
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,407
our minds are the most valuable tools
we possess.

283
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,966
And we must keep them sharp
at all times.

284
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,909
Thank you. See you next week.
Take your notes.

285
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,127
"The mind's the most valuable tool."

286
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,288
He should know.
He's the biggest tool on campus.

287
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,662
He acts like he's Zeus or something.
I hate that.

288
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,429
Well, the least he can do is realize
that he's not a god.

289
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,595
I am.

290
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:23,697
Hey, Sanders.
Nice work in there. Very impressive.

291
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,573
Give me a break, both of you guys, okay?
I'm not in the mood.

292
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:27,942
Relax, Sanders, it's us.

293
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:29,378
Excuse me?

294
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,045
Hi. You guys are second- years, right?

295
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,521
Yeah, that's right. Who's asking?

296
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,459
The name's Hansen. Jessica Hansen.
I just got in from Harvard today.

297
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:43,790
Jessica Hansen.

298
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,157
- Yeah, I saw you inside.
- You were observing us.

299
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,267
Yeah, what can I say?
I'm just naturally curious.

300
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,303
Good for you. Welcome to Hudson.

301
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,838
But as you've observed,
we are second- years...

302
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,807
which means we're busy.

303
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,308
Hey, is it true what they say
about you guys?

304
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:07,312
Don't know.
What is it exactly they say about us?

305
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,385
- That you're good.
- They'd be right about that.

306
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,321
What else do they say?

307
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,755
That you throw the best parties,
well- connected...

308
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:19,195
got some heavy- hitting careers
lined up for yourselves.

309
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,892
But that's not the whole story, is it?

310
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,667
Look, I'm cool with it, you guys.

311
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,764
I came here to hook up
with some color- outside- the- lines types.

312
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,173
Maybe we are. Maybe we aren't.

313
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:35,211
My question would be, what's it to you?

314
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,616
Like I said, I'm just trying
to make some new friends.

315
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,653
By the way, that professor
had no right to talk to you that way.

316
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,450
The name's Paige,
and I can take care of myself.

317
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:45,615
I believe it.

318
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,524
Listen, I just got out of
one Alpha Boys' Club.

319
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,461
<i>I'm new in town. </i>
<i>Come on, heIp a sister out. </i>

320
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,363
Just welcome me to campus.
I'll buy you a meal.

321
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,458
- I can't. We....
- We're busy.

322
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,765
- Doing what?
- Nothing that concerns you.

323
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:02,933
But go ahead, enjoy your meal.
We're not doing anything without you.

324
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,533
Okay.

325
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:13,441
I can't remember the last time I sat down
and ate a solid meal.

326
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,986
I thought you might need a break.

327
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,647
You got that whole"overachiever"
thing going for you.

328
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:21,250
Yeah, right. I'm doing everything I can
just to keep up.

329
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,452
You seem to push yourself pretty hard.

330
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,463
Yeah, but I mean, who doesn't?

331
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,329
You, me. I mean,
it's the whole med school thing, right?

332
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,697
You pass your MCATs...

333
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:32,635
always busting your ass
trying to max out your potential.

334
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,296
It must be nice.

335
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:40,305
I just, you know, have to stop
and appreciate it sometimes.

336
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,204
Not everyone's so lucky. We got in.

337
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,014
So let me ask you.

338
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,678
Is everyone here
as uptight as your friends?

339
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,919
Those guys, you know, they're all right.

340
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,515
You know what
the competition can do to you.

341
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:55,958
Sure. But that doesn't mean...

342
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,327
we have to hurt ourselves
just to keep up with them.

343
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,758
What are you talking about?

344
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:03,828
Sorry.

345
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,868
Hello? Now?

346
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,637
Yeah. No, I'll be right there. All right.

347
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,609
Listen, thanks for lunch,
but I gotta run.

348
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,544
Paige. I know.

349
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:19,807
You know what?

350
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,110
About the drugs.

351
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,781
I don't know if you do it to keep up,
or to wind down--

352
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,983
Drugs? What are you talking about?

353
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,492
What kind of freak are you?

354
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,730
- Okay, now I'm confused.
- Don't touch me.

355
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:39,828
Don't come near me.

356
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,498
I don't know what your psycho agenda is,
but screw you.

357
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,235
Stay away from me.

358
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,457
Finally.
Yeah, we are up and running.

359
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,499
Congratulations, Doctor. We did it.

360
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,468
He's dead.

361
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,282
Looking good. Keep him steady.

362
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,250
Time?
Eight seconds.

363
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,781
Death looks good on you, Steve.

364
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,919
Twelve seconds. We're getting close.

365
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,828
All right, 20 seconds.
Time to do your thing.

366
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,059
Clear.

367
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,403
No change.

368
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:19,094
Now, that was a trip.

369
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:22,233
Did it work for you, Steven?

370
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,268
I've got a better question.

371
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,596
What the hell is she doing here?

372
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,001
I could ask you the same thing.

373
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,343
I'll bet your answer's a lot more
interesting than mine.

374
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,847
- Guess again.
- I'm guessing what I just saw...

375
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,713
could get you all kicked out of med school
by lunchtime.

376
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,446
Or we could talk.

377
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:48,584
So let me get this straight.
You got this little hobby.

378
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,924
- You kill yourselves?
- For starters.

379
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,931
And then you resuscitate.
That's the plan.

380
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,096
But what's the point?

381
00:23:56,802 --> 00:24:00,898
The point, Jessica, is that
when you come back, you're not the same.

382
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,909
You know the urban myth about
how the moment you die...

383
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:08,275
your whole life flashes before your eyes?
It's true.

384
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:13,344
Memories. You're unlocking
repressed memories.

385
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:17,787
And what are they, anyway, memories?
Just chemicals locked in the brain...

386
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,256
between your occipital fissure
and the temporal lobe.

387
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:24,318
And the best part is, they're just
lying there, waiting to be tapped into.

388
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:28,462
You guys are good.
Too bad your little experiment kills you.

389
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,961
Almost kills you.

390
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:35,737
I saw my father's face the day he left me.

391
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:40,343
I was two- and- a- half when it happened,
and now it's as clear as....

392
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,682
Let's just say hi- def video can kiss my ass,
'cause I have clarity.

393
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,981
Crystal clear memory of that day,
and so much more.

394
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,516
I'm next.

395
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,323
No. Paige, you can't.

396
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,516
You want to dig into your past, I get it.

397
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,391
But there's gotta be a better way.

398
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:58,986
<i>You can deaI with this. </i>

399
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:00,759
All you have to do is go to the source.

400
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,426
Find out whoever it is
you have unresolved issues with--

401
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,561
And what,
have a good long talk with them?

402
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:09,664
See their point of view? Reach closure?
You think I haven't already tried that?

403
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,265
You think this isn't my last resort?

404
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:16,275
Fine, if you know so much,
you go talk to my father.

405
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,215
Because nothing is gonna stop me.

406
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,798
Hi. I need just one more thing.

407
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,534
Mr. Sanders?
Right block. Wrong house.

408
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,168
Mike Sanders lives right there.

409
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,407
Thanks.
My pleasure.

410
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,281
- Who'd you say you were?
- A friend of Paige's.

411
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:58,879
We go to school together.

412
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:02,620
Mr. Sanders, I'm really worried about her.
I think Paige is gonna hurt herself.

413
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,855
No. My daughter would never do
anything like that.

414
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,195
I wish you were right,
but I don't think you are.

415
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,325
And you're the only one who can stop her.

416
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,302
Why am I the only one?

417
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:15,165
You're her father.
You have a history with Paige that--

418
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:18,367
Look, whatever she told you
about me isn't true.

419
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:21,744
Touch my own daughter?
It's sickening just thinking about it.

420
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:25,010
<i>And the craziest part is, </i>
<i>Paige doesn't remember anything. </i>

421
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,177
Just some nonsense about
the moon and the stars.

422
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,616
The moon and the stars,
what's that mean?

423
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,987
You're her friend. You tell me.

424
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,629
Tru Davies?

425
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,857
Is Tru Davies here?

426
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,894
<i>I thought</i>
<i>you were taking your test. </i>

427
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:50,702
I am. I'm just going a little late.
I have to find someone first.

428
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,341
<i>I'm gIad I caught you. </i>

429
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,004
Look, I need you to concentrate.

430
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,046
And the names of the horses are....

431
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,675
Harrison, I told you,
I can't remember them.

432
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,049
Look, I'm really sorry, but--
Hey, Hansen?

433
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:03,177
I gotta go.

434
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,313
Tru!

435
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,526
Were you just talking to my father?
What's wrong with you?

436
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:13,690
First you force your way into my life,
and then my group, and now my home?

437
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,596
How <i>SingIe White FemaIe</i> are you?

438
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:19,501
I know I'm butting in,
but just give me one minute to explain.

439
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:21,766
Okay, one minute.

440
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,636
I was 12 when my mom died.

441
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,505
You were just a kid.

442
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:29,876
I watched it happen, right in front of me.

443
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:32,816
I have questions about
my mother's murder...

444
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,943
that I may never be able to answer.

445
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,080
As much as I'd like to know the truth,
it's not worth dying over.

446
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:41,592
- Yeah, but why do you think I would die?
- Because I've done the research.

447
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,460
The heart can't withstand it,
and if the heart does, the brain can't.

448
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,896
Sure, some people get lucky
and come out okay.

449
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,230
But not everyone. Not you.

450
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:54,435
Look, do yourself a favor. Call it off.

451
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,006
It's suicide.

452
00:27:56,641 --> 00:28:00,475
I mean, it's not like I've never had doubts.
I mean, I just....

453
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,080
I have these feelings about my past...

454
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:05,916
and I don't know what else to do.

455
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:09,147
Talk to your father again.
Or a therapist. Anyone.

456
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,018
Just don't go through
with the experiment.

457
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,560
Fine, I'll call it off.

458
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,859
I don't know why I trust you, but I do.

459
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:23,093
- I'll tell the guys.
- That's great.

460
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,829
You have no idea how relieved I am.

461
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:27,167
Harvard, how's it going?

462
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,232
Hey, Dan. I'm glad you're here...

463
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,808
because I wanted to talk to you
about something.

464
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,104
Sure, great, love to hear it.

465
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,976
There's just someone I met
at the sign- ups for Molecular Bio.

466
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,777
I really think that you should meet her.

467
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,213
Hi. Jessica Hansen.

468
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:49,020
<i>Is this the one you toId me about? </i>

469
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:52,552
And will the real Jessica Hansen
please stand up?

470
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,688
I don't understand.

471
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:56,097
Paige, I can explain.
Allow me.

472
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,931
I'm Jessica Hansen.
I transferred from Harvard yesterday...

473
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:02,131
and this woman here
is trying some lame- ass identity scam.

474
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,674
Which, sorry, honey, it won't work.

475
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,039
And now that's over with.

476
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,979
How about you tell us
who the hell you really are?

477
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,379
Paige, I--
Don't.

478
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:14,612
Because as far as I'm concerned,
everything you've told me is a lie.

479
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:18,122
I bet you're not even
a real medical student, are you?

480
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:22,919
Paige, just wait.

481
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,836
Two hours and counting.

482
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,876
- Steven? Steven, wait up.
- What do you want from me?

483
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,377
- You've got to talk her out of it.
- No way.

484
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,504
It's going to kill her.

485
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,741
No, it won't.
Look at me. I've never been better.

486
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,250
Look, we all have questions
we need answered.

487
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,946
But Paige is gonna make
the biggest mistake of her life...

488
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,319
in just a few hours,
unless you talk her out of it.

489
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,915
A little late for that.
Why?

490
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,984
She's doing it right now.

491
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,225
Okay, ready to come back.

492
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,391
Come on.

493
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,410
I can't get her back. She's not responding.

494
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:22,446
Got dobutamine?
No.

495
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,742
Dopamine?
No, none of that, either.

496
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:32,311
She's been under too long.
She should've been out by now.

497
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,799
It's amazing, isn't it?

498
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,344
How thin the line between life and death
can be?

499
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,845
<i>The nearIy instant recovery time. </i>

500
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,882
That's why I designed this
the way that I did.

501
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:59,142
That's great, Dan.

502
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:02,345
<i>What wouId you have done</i>
<i>if I couIdn't revive her? </i>

503
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,182
Hey, are you okay?

504
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,017
You saved my life.

505
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,905
You feel like telling us who you really are?

506
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,603
Sure. I just gotta do one thing first.

507
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,748
You've over three hours late.

508
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:40,013
Better get started then?

509
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,225
Thank you.

510
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:08,981
Thanks.

511
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:30,002
It looks like we have
a little petechial imaging in the eye...

512
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,076
usually associated with
some sort of trauma.

513
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,336
My God.

514
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,912
She didn't die from the experiment.

515
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,345
- I'll be right back.
- No.

516
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:42,875
Once you leave, you're done.
You understand?

517
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:46,188
You, your test, your future.

518
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,858
I'm sorry, I have to go,
but I can reschedule, right?

519
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,189
Sure.

520
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:55,731
Just be back here bright and early
first thing next year.

521
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,733
Guess I'll see you next year.

522
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,638
She unlocked a memory, didn't she?

523
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:12,272
Yeah. But it's none of your business.

524
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,477
Besides, Paige is fine,
and you're not even a medical student.

525
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:19,182
Well, pretty soon you won't be either
unless you tell me where she is.

526
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:20,485
You want to play chicken?

527
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,583
Because you're right.
I'm not a med student.

528
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,958
I have nothing to lose, but you do.

529
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,998
Especially with those track marks
on your arm.

530
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:31,027
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

531
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,266
All she remembered is a man.

532
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:36,397
He hurt her, touched her.
She wasn't that specific.

533
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:39,567
And then some crap about
the moon and the stars.

534
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:41,702
I don't know what it means.

535
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:42,871
I do.

536
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,275
Paige!

537
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:48,078
- Where is she?
- I told you, she's not here.

538
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:51,246
- I really have to find her.
- All right, I've warned you once.

539
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:53,916
I don't know who you are,
or what you think you're doing...

540
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:54,980
but this is harassment.

541
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,083
She's in trouble.

542
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,357
You don't understand.
Paige did something tonight.

543
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:00,453
What'd she do?

544
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:04,558
A really stupid and dangerous experiment,
but now she remembers everything.

545
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,593
And you think this would
bring her back to me?

546
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:07,797
Her car's parked out front.

547
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,965
You said something about
the moon and the stars.

548
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,302
That has to mean something.

549
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:14,503
Go. Just get out of here.

550
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:23,977
That doesn't make sense.

551
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,626
- Hello?
- Did someone forget her blind date?

552
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:33,756
No, I didn't forget.
I just couldn't make it this time.

553
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:34,820
This time?

554
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,696
There was a time
when you could make it?

555
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:37,791
I'm sorry.

556
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,861
Okay, look, I'll cover.
<i>You're the best. </i>

557
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,064
Bye.

558
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:47,336
Jeremy, hi.

559
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:51,381
I'm so sorry. I don't think my friend's
gonna be able to make it tonight.

560
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:55,310
You're not Tru? Of course not.

561
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,213
You're too good to be true.

562
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:03,687
Oh, my God, did you just make that up
right now?

563
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:05,388
That's hilarious.

564
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:20,403
The moon and the stars. It's the neighbor.

565
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,078
You don't know what you're saying.

566
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:24,944
For the first time in years,
I know exactly what I am saying.

567
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,213
Paige. You've always been a smart girl.
Be smart now.

568
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,880
I was a child, you son of a bitch. I was 9.

569
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:34,118
All right, this is ridiculous.
I'm calling your father.

570
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,423
Good. Call my father.
Call the police. Call the District Attorney.

571
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:40,521
I'm pressing charges.
You are gonna pay for what you did to me.

572
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:41,622
Just hush.

573
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,564
Don't touch me.
Just be quiet.

574
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,829
Quiet, please!
Don't touch me!

575
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:46,892
I said, quiet!

576
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,871
Get off me!
Be quiet!

577
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,147
No one's gonna believe you anyway.

578
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,643
I'll believe her.

579
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,614
Get out!

580
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,918
There's a statute of limitations, you know.
It's been years.

581
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:10,256
Go ahead, go tell the whole world!
Who's gonna believe you?

582
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:14,026
Oh, God! I'm so sorry, Daddy.

583
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,745
So, how are you feeling?

584
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:38,520
I thought remembering would be the end.
But it isn't.

585
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,220
It's just the first step.

586
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:44,522
A lot to be said for a good first step.

587
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:49,127
So who are you, anyway?
And please don't say Jessica Hansen.

588
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,430
I had to take on her name
so I could talk to you.

589
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:56,337
I mean, if I told you I was really
just some med school wannabe...

590
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,432
who works in a morgue,
would you have listened?

591
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:02,341
Probably not. So why'd you help me?

592
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:06,783
I'm still trying
to figure that out for myself.

593
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:10,014
I guess you could say it's sort of my job.

594
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:15,886
Well, if you ever figure it out,
you know where to find me.

595
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,157
I'd like that.
Med school gets a little cold sometimes.

596
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:22,024
I'll take your word for it.

597
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,199
Good luck.

598
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:31,369
Hey, Tru?

599
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:35,067
You'll make one hell of a doctor someday.

600
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,280
Someday, yeah.

601
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,113
<i>So, how'd the MCA Ts go? </i>

602
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,282
They didn't. How did my date go?

603
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:48,586
<i>Not bad. </i>

604
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:52,356
Until he used the same line
on the waitress that he used on me.

605
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,830
<i>HonestIy, you didn't miss much. </i>
I had a feeling.

606
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,234
But still, Tru, I'm telling you,
the perfect guy is out there somewhere.

607
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:02,499
<i>You just haven't met him yet. </i>

608
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,575
That, or I've met him too many times.

609
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:06,837
<i>ExactIy. </i>

610
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,136
Wait, how's that work?

611
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:08,812
See you, Linds.

612
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,347
- Hello, again.
- Hi.

613
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,952
I'm gonna try and get past you here
without any hard contact.

614
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,317
Don't want to break anything.

615
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,856
I was thinking
about our little accident earlier.

616
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:22,484
Maybe it wasn't such a bad thing.

617
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,923
Because otherwise,
we never would've met.

618
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,028
And I'm glad we did.

619
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,192
Yeah. Me, too.

620
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:34,865
At least this time, you won't forget me.

621
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,833
I don't think I could ever forget you.

622
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,903
Anyway, I gotta go.

623
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,844
- To be continued?
- Absolutely.

624
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:48,080
Say hi to your folks.

625
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,613
Like I said, lucky guesser.

626
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,793
Hello?
<i>Tru. </i>

627
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:03,566
Harrison, please.
For the last time, I can't remember--

628
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:06,364
No. Listen.
I didn't go to the track today after all.

629
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:09,031
And you know what? I had a great day.

630
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,138
Really?
<i>Yeah, I had some fun. </i>

631
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,505
<i>I read a book. </i>

632
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,408
I can't remember the last time I did that.

633
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:19,245
And, you know, plus other stuff.

634
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,783
The point is,
I had a hell of a day.

635
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,046
And I didn't need a boost
from my big sister to do it this time.

636
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:29,889
I'm not surprised. You've just gotta
believe in yourself a little.

637
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,484
Kind of like you?

638
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,854
Just like me. Good night, Harrison.

639
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,470
I knew you didn't need this.

640
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,242
Hey, you were right.
County Records called.

641
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:59,817
It's your mom's file.
Whenever you're ready.

642
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:05,651
Thanks, Davis.

643
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,328
You gonna open them?

644
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:11,928
Later.

645
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:16,036
I was kind of hoping to live
in the present for a little bit.

646
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,239
Sorry about the MCATs.

647
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:24,279
I guess that means you'll be
sticking around here a little bit longer.

648
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:27,783
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.

649
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,384
It's funny, I met a girl today.

650
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:35,358
<i>AII she reaIIy wanted to do</i>
<i>was understand...</i>

651
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:38,661
why she feels the things she does.

652
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:44,195
Maybe that's all any of us want.
Just to understand.

653
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,293
And you don't?

654
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,562
Not lately, no.

655
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,305
It's not easy, is it?

656
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,280
Carrying the burden you do.

657
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:00,311
Excuse me?

658
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,647
Some would call it a blessing.

659
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,544
Others a curse.

660
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:09,188
I see it more as a calling.

661
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,123
Davis?

662
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,062
I know more than you think I know, Tru...

663
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:21,201
about what you can do.

664
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:25,931
About how you help the dead
get another chance at life.

665
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,339
<i>Have a seat, Tru. </i>

666
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,050
It's time I told you what I know.
