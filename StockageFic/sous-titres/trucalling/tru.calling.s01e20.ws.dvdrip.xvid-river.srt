1
00:00:15,202 --> 00:00:16,066
Help me.

2
00:01:11,192 --> 00:01:12,523
He's gone.

3
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:16,592
He must've taken off
as soon as he realized we were on to him.

4
00:01:16,664 --> 00:01:18,427
Yeah. Gone. Almost.

5
00:01:18,966 --> 00:01:21,366
-What's on your mind?
-Well, here's the thing.

6
00:01:21,435 --> 00:01:24,097
We know who you are. You are life.

7
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:27,470
You give a second chance to those
that have died before their time...

8
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:30,305
-and we know who Jack is.
-My opposite.

9
00:01:30,678 --> 00:01:33,169
-Choice adjective excluded.
-Right.

10
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:37,710
He relives days to ensure that
those victims once again die.

11
00:01:37,785 --> 00:01:39,446
Okay, so we know that.

12
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,546
Here's my best guess.
The next time that your day restarts...

13
00:01:42,623 --> 00:01:44,887
our friend Jack Harper
will make his return...

14
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,393
because it's clear why he came here
two months ago.

15
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:49,190
His work is undone.

16
00:01:49,597 --> 00:01:52,589
-He came to find his opposite.
-And stop me.

17
00:02:00,474 --> 00:02:02,408
[telephone ringing]

18
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,741
<i>Hey, it's Tru. Leave a message.</i>

19
00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:14,485
<i>Hey, it's Lindsay.</i>

20
00:02:14,555 --> 00:02:17,752
<i>I know it's Iike 6.:00 a.m.,</i>
<i>but I had to caII and say one thing.</i>

21
00:02:17,825 --> 00:02:18,985
5:15.

22
00:02:19,427 --> 00:02:23,193
l'm getting freaking married today, Tru.
Can you believe that?

23
00:02:23,364 --> 00:02:25,559
lt still doesn't mean l'll pick up the phone.

24
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:29,034
<i>My God! And I aIso noticed you RSVP'd,</i>
<i>pIus one.</i>

25
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:31,537
So, who are you bringing?
All right, never mind.

26
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:33,470
l'll just call you later. Bye.

27
00:02:38,913 --> 00:02:41,006
l've driven women to drink.

28
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:43,409
l've driven women to other women.

29
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:46,714
But l have never driven a woman
to the altar...

30
00:02:47,054 --> 00:02:49,022
within a month of dumping her.

31
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,251
Look, here's the thing. l love Lindsay...

32
00:02:51,325 --> 00:02:53,691
but she's never been
very good at being alone.

33
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:57,629
l blew it, you know?
l was undependable, unreliable.

34
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:01,862
But ever since this Randall guy,
l have decided...

35
00:03:02,403 --> 00:03:06,271
that l'm gonna be a better man.
You know, someone l can be proud of.

36
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,332
Someone you can be proud of.
A new leaf, so to speak.

37
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,038
-A new leaf?
-Well, yeah. l'm a young guy...

38
00:03:12,113 --> 00:03:14,513
it's never too late to change your spots.

39
00:03:14,582 --> 00:03:18,018
Speaking of sudden character
transformations, any luck finding Jack?

40
00:03:18,085 --> 00:03:19,575
No, nothing.

41
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:24,215
l scoured the town, just like you asked.
l went to bars, strip joints.

42
00:03:24,425 --> 00:03:27,622
-About that new leaf?
-Pacing myself.

43
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:32,056
l'll tell you who l have run into lately. Luc.

44
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:35,067
-So, you've been avoiding him.
-Here's the thing.

45
00:03:35,136 --> 00:03:39,266
The last time l spoke to Luc,
l promised him l'd tell him about me.

46
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,366
But as long as l don't tell him,
l can still have hope for us.

47
00:03:42,443 --> 00:03:45,469
'Cause l know that as soon as l do,
l won't even have that.

48
00:03:45,546 --> 00:03:46,979
No, maybe.

49
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:50,481
But maybe not. But, see, the point is...

50
00:03:50,551 --> 00:03:53,315
that you will never know unless you try.

51
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:56,320
And if l can turn a new leaf, anyone can.

52
00:03:58,092 --> 00:04:00,788
-l gotta go, Wonder Woman.
-Bye.

53
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:09,166
-Hey, l hope l'm not interrupting.
-No, come here.

54
00:04:10,037 --> 00:04:13,200
Watch this. lt's still cooking.

55
00:04:13,274 --> 00:04:16,573
The photo sits in the developer
and the chemicals draw out the image.

56
00:04:16,644 --> 00:04:19,772
Just give it a couple more seconds and....

57
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:23,372
lt's an old roll l never developed.

58
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:26,483
-She looks familiar.
-Yeah.

59
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:29,220
-Ex-girlfriend.
-Sounds complicated.

60
00:04:29,323 --> 00:04:31,848
lt is. Just like her.

61
00:04:33,494 --> 00:04:37,021
l'm sorry if you feel like
l've been avoiding you.

62
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:40,999
Well, l'm sorry, too.
Mainly because you're so damn good at it.

63
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:46,136
Look. Maybe heart-to-heart's
not your thing, and that's fine.

64
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,876
-No law says you have to explain--
-How about tonight?

65
00:04:50,845 --> 00:04:52,335
-Tonight?
-Yes.

66
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,472
Come to Lindsay's wedding with me,
and l will explain everything.

67
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:02,580
-Semiformal, right?
-l'll see you at 6:00?

68
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:05,784
Okay.

69
00:05:07,695 --> 00:05:10,892
But, hey, Luc?
Just remember, she is complicated.

70
00:05:10,965 --> 00:05:12,091
Right.

71
00:05:24,678 --> 00:05:25,940
Harrison.

72
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:29,510
Jack. What the hell are you doing here?

73
00:05:29,683 --> 00:05:31,810
-l came to see a friend.
-Great.

74
00:05:31,886 --> 00:05:34,116
You let me know when he shows up.

75
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:40,117
Look, l know Tru wants you to think
l'm the enemy. l'm not.

76
00:05:41,061 --> 00:05:45,191
Your sister and l
just see things differently, that's all.

77
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:47,564
Right. She saves people...

78
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:51,230
-and you kill them.
-l'm not a killer.

79
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,268
Straight up. When a bullet gets shot
into a man's chest...

80
00:05:55,342 --> 00:05:56,809
l don't pull the trigger.

81
00:05:56,877 --> 00:06:00,404
When a drunk driver takes out a family
of four, l'm not behind the wheel.

82
00:06:00,481 --> 00:06:02,813
But when those people ask
for my sister's help...

83
00:06:02,883 --> 00:06:05,943
you're not exactly lending a hand now,
are you?

84
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,519
Death can be tragic.

85
00:06:07,588 --> 00:06:11,490
Death can be unfair. But as much as
we may all hate to admit it...

86
00:06:11,558 --> 00:06:15,426
death is inevitable. l'm merely helping
fate get what it wants.

87
00:06:15,963 --> 00:06:18,454
And you're telling me this because?

88
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:22,400
Because she listens to you.
And you love her.

89
00:06:23,203 --> 00:06:26,434
And l know that you will find a way
to make her stop.

90
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:30,334
Stop saving the lives of people
who are supposed to die.

91
00:06:30,744 --> 00:06:35,545
Stop messing with fate. And stop
screwing with the order of the universe.

92
00:06:41,956 --> 00:06:44,823
Yeah. Okay. No.

93
00:06:46,193 --> 00:06:49,162
No, it's okay.
Don't worry, l'll take care of it.

94
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:50,526
l'll be right there.

95
00:06:50,597 --> 00:06:53,088
But she'll never stop,
and l'll never ask her to.

96
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:56,398
So do yourself a favor, friend.
You stay the hell away from me...

97
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,960
and my sister.

98
00:07:02,943 --> 00:07:06,140
We're gathered here today
to celebrate the union of two people.

99
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:09,376
Lindsay and Randall. Two people
who have found each other...

100
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,352
in a world where we rarely slow down
to let ourselves be found.

101
00:07:13,754 --> 00:07:18,453
And to celebrate that love, the bride has
asked her very good friend, Tru Davies...

102
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:20,618
to read a passage today. Tru?

103
00:07:34,675 --> 00:07:38,111
''l carry your heart with me
(l carry it in my heart)

104
00:07:38,512 --> 00:07:41,777
''l fear no fate (for you are my fate,
my sweet)

105
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:46,178
''i want no world (for beautiful
you are my world, my true)

106
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,853
''and it's you are whatever a moon
has always meant

107
00:07:49,923 --> 00:07:52,892
''and whatever a sun will always sing
is you

108
00:07:56,997 --> 00:07:59,864
''here is the deepest secret
nobody knows''

109
00:08:11,145 --> 00:08:13,170
Excuse me just a moment.

110
00:08:21,255 --> 00:08:24,850
-Your cell was off. There was no other--
-Davis, what's wrong?

111
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:27,487
Your brother. He's been shot.

112
00:08:31,698 --> 00:08:34,496
-He's got bullet trauma, single entry.
-Doesn't look good.

113
00:08:34,568 --> 00:08:37,503
Let's set up the rapid infusers,
and get a truckload of O-Neg.

114
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:41,507
Could be a hole through the anterior LV.
Get the thoracic surgeon on call, stat!

115
00:08:41,575 --> 00:08:45,944
Get him to Trauma before he drains
into the pleural cavity. Not a lot of time!

116
00:08:48,282 --> 00:08:49,613
God, Harrison!

117
00:08:49,883 --> 00:08:51,475
l'm his sister, what happened to him?

118
00:08:51,552 --> 00:08:54,316
EMT radioed ahead,
they found him in a house on Bank Street.

119
00:08:54,388 --> 00:08:57,084
l'll ask. lf anything happens,
l promise l'll ask.

120
00:08:57,157 --> 00:08:59,853
No, you are not gonna die.
Do you hear me? You'll be fine.

121
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:02,589
Let us do our job. That's all you can do.

122
00:09:18,946 --> 00:09:20,641
-Any word?
-No.

123
00:09:24,985 --> 00:09:27,749
lt's okay. lt's Harrison.
He's a fighter, you know?

124
00:09:27,821 --> 00:09:29,448
He's gonna be okay.

125
00:09:31,024 --> 00:09:33,083
l'm so sorry about the wedding.

126
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,152
The wedding can wait.
Lindsay belongs with you.

127
00:09:37,464 --> 00:09:40,490
Hello. l'm looking for a patient.
Harrison Davies?

128
00:09:40,868 --> 00:09:41,960
Excuse me.

129
00:09:42,035 --> 00:09:44,765
l'm sorry, ma'am. He's still in surgery.

130
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:49,768
l'm Harrison's sister. Do you know him?

131
00:09:49,843 --> 00:09:52,641
Not really. l was the one who called <i>9</i>1 1 .

132
00:09:52,713 --> 00:09:54,578
-He was shot.
-Your were with him?

133
00:09:54,648 --> 00:09:58,106
No, l mean, it's my ex.

134
00:09:58,552 --> 00:10:00,520
He just gets so jealous.

135
00:10:00,854 --> 00:10:03,721
l am so sorry. l shouldn't have come here.

136
00:10:03,824 --> 00:10:07,783
-l just wanted to make sure he was okay.
-Your ex? Who's.... Wait!

137
00:10:09,196 --> 00:10:10,254
Dad.

138
00:10:10,898 --> 00:10:12,729
l was in town for a meeting.

139
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:15,829
They found my card in Harrison's wallet.

140
00:10:16,203 --> 00:10:18,398
He's hurt, Dad. lt's not good.

141
00:10:19,072 --> 00:10:21,131
We don't know anything yet.

142
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:23,771
l'm gonna find the doctor.

143
00:10:23,844 --> 00:10:27,405
He's still in surgery.
They just told me to wait here.

144
00:10:28,348 --> 00:10:30,009
Okay. We'll wait.

145
00:10:35,122 --> 00:10:36,350
Excuse me.

146
00:10:47,034 --> 00:10:48,023
Hey!

147
00:10:49,136 --> 00:10:52,469
l want you out of here right now!
You are not welcome here!

148
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:54,006
l came to see my friend.

149
00:10:54,074 --> 00:10:56,941
You had something to do with this,
l know you did.

150
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,501
This morning
l went to your brother's place.

151
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:03,277
Our conversation ended badly,
so l called him to clarify.

152
00:11:03,584 --> 00:11:06,485
A paramedic answered the phone.
l got worried.

153
00:11:07,654 --> 00:11:11,112
lf anything happens to him,
l'm holding you responsible.

154
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:13,785
Do you understand that? lt is on you!

155
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:15,283
RlCHARD: Tru

156
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:22,231
-Tru, sweetheart.
-No.

157
00:11:22,302 --> 00:11:24,862
They did everything that they could.

158
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:27,762
No.

159
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:31,568
-No, he can't be.
-Tru!

160
00:11:44,324 --> 00:11:47,020
Talk to me. Talk to me, Harry!

161
00:11:47,227 --> 00:11:50,355
-Miss, you're not supposed to be in here.
-He needs me.

162
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,829
You said....

163
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:57,696
Harry, you always said you'd ask me.
Please, l'm right here.

164
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:01,040
Just ask me.

165
00:12:15,088 --> 00:12:16,851
Sweetheart, come on.

166
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,754
l'll be waiting at the morgue.

167
00:12:23,397 --> 00:12:24,989
l won't leave you.

168
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:29,435
l'm always by your side.

169
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:44,472
Tru.

170
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:49,683
You can't let him win.

171
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,894
<i>Hey, it's Tru. Leave a message.</i>

172
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:01,695
<i>-Hey, it's Lindsay. Look, I know--</i>
-Thank God!

173
00:13:01,768 --> 00:13:05,727
<i>But I'm getting freaking married today.</i>
<i>Can you beIieve that?</i>

174
00:13:05,806 --> 00:13:07,569
Yeah, let's hope so.

175
00:13:17,384 --> 00:13:19,352
l'm only a few minutes--

176
00:13:20,754 --> 00:13:22,153
lt's good to see you, too!

177
00:13:22,222 --> 00:13:25,817
l tried to reach you all morning.
l called your house, l called your cell.

178
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:27,291
l'm a heavy sleeper. What?

179
00:13:27,361 --> 00:13:31,229
-l went by your place. You weren't there.
-Why? What's going on?

180
00:13:31,365 --> 00:13:33,833
Today isn't gonna be your day, Harrison.

181
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,266
Today's the day that
l'm gonna be a better man.

182
00:13:36,336 --> 00:13:38,770
-Today's the day that l'm gonna--
-Die.

183
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,206
Let me get this straight. l'm dead,
in the hospital, and l ask for your help?

184
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,645
Fortunately, yeah.

185
00:13:48,715 --> 00:13:49,704
Wow.

186
00:13:51,151 --> 00:13:54,416
-So was Lindsay there?
-What?

187
00:13:54,788 --> 00:13:57,188
Lindsay. Was she there at the hospital?

188
00:13:57,257 --> 00:14:00,658
Yeah, she postponed the wedding
as soon as she heard you were shot.

189
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:01,887
Okay.

190
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:05,624
That is great! Yes!

191
00:14:05,966 --> 00:14:09,333
So, were people sad
and, like, tears flowing and--

192
00:14:09,403 --> 00:14:10,961
-Harrison.
-What?

193
00:14:11,037 --> 00:14:15,098
Well, come on! How many times
does a guy get to die and come back?

194
00:14:15,876 --> 00:14:17,138
Set the scene for me.

195
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,940
l can set the scene for you,
or l can keep you alive.

196
00:14:20,013 --> 00:14:23,210
-Which do you prefer?
-Fine.

197
00:14:25,118 --> 00:14:28,713
Okay. First of all, who are you dating?

198
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:30,381
Dating? No one.

199
00:14:30,457 --> 00:14:33,517
Wrong time to be coy, Harry.
There was a woman at the hospital.

200
00:14:33,593 --> 00:14:36,585
Said you were shot by her jealous ex
on Bank Street.

201
00:14:36,663 --> 00:14:38,961
Do you know anyone who lives
on Bank Street?

202
00:14:39,032 --> 00:14:40,226
No one.

203
00:14:41,168 --> 00:14:45,264
Look, there's no girlfriend.
There's no jealous exes.

204
00:14:45,338 --> 00:14:49,934
There's no Bank Street. Are you sure
it was me who asked for help yesterday?

205
00:14:50,777 --> 00:14:54,076
Okay, we may not know why you
were killed, but we know one thing.

206
00:14:54,147 --> 00:14:56,638
Your death is entirely preventable.

207
00:14:56,716 --> 00:14:59,947
So let me ask you this.
On a scale of one to ten...

208
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,215
how much weeping
are we talking about here?

209
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:06,248
Harrison, everything you did yesterday,
we have to do differently today.

210
00:15:06,326 --> 00:15:08,123
Okay. So where to?

211
00:15:08,261 --> 00:15:10,991
The place you were least likely
to be yesterday.

212
00:15:14,134 --> 00:15:17,160
How can you be so sure
l wasn't here yesterday?

213
00:15:17,237 --> 00:15:20,570
Because the last book you read
had pictures in it.

214
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,405
That's a good point. Yeah.

215
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:25,064
-l got here as fast as l could.
-Hey.

216
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:33,972
-What?
-l'm so sorry.

217
00:15:34,217 --> 00:15:38,415
Please accept my condolences.
You were so...young.

218
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:42,453
Dude, l'm still alive. l died yesterday.

219
00:15:43,894 --> 00:15:45,987
Why don't we talk in private.

220
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:48,553
This one's personal,
but you're doing everything right.

221
00:15:48,632 --> 00:15:51,601
l can't think of any reason
why you can't win this one.

222
00:15:51,668 --> 00:15:52,828
l can.

223
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:58,504
Jack came by the hospital last night.
You don't remember me telling you this...

224
00:15:58,575 --> 00:16:00,941
but yesterday he showed up
at Harrison's apartment.

225
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,103
You don't think Jack
has anything to do with....

226
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,204
No, not yesterday.

227
00:16:04,281 --> 00:16:06,215
But if Jack is my opposite, then today....

228
00:16:06,283 --> 00:16:08,717
He'll make sure that fate plays out
the same way.

229
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:11,948
Meaning, it's his job
to make sure Harrison dies.

230
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:14,852
Oops. Sorry.

231
00:16:15,859 --> 00:16:16,917
Hello.

232
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:18,722
He seems to be handling it okay.

233
00:16:18,795 --> 00:16:23,357
He wanted an estimate of number
of tears people shed last night, in gallons.

234
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:26,732
Okay, don't worry.
l'll take care of it. No, l'll be right there.

235
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:29,533
Look, this is probably something
you don't want to hear.

236
00:16:29,606 --> 00:16:33,337
-But there is someplace l need to be.
-No way. Not a chance.

237
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,174
Someone's in a jam
and they need my help. lt's important.

238
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,612
-No!
-Probably called yesterday, too.

239
00:16:38,682 --> 00:16:43,085
Who is it, and what do they want?
Need l remind you, you died yesterday.

240
00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:47,581
All right, look.

241
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:52,026
This may sound stupid, but ever since
Lindsay met this Randall guy...

242
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,562
l took stock.

243
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:58,165
And l'm tired of being the screwup.

244
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:03,668
Look, there's this Rec Center
around the corner from my place.

245
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,436
They have all these sorts of programs
for these kids.

246
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:09,740
Well, the other day l just walk in
to get change for the meter...

247
00:17:09,813 --> 00:17:12,338
and l walk out someone's big brother.

248
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:16,518
-Who's the kid?
-Ethan McCrane.

249
00:17:16,987 --> 00:17:19,387
His folks got divorced last year.

250
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:22,956
Look, l may not know how it is
to be a great dad...

251
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:25,654
but l know how to survive without one.

252
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:29,494
That's Ethan on the phone,
and he got busted shoplifting.

253
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:34,026
He's too afraid to call his mom, so unless
an adult goes there to claim him...

254
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:36,834
-the owner's gonna call the cops.
-And where's the store?

255
00:17:36,906 --> 00:17:40,842
-lt's on Carver and Fifth.
-lt's a good three miles from Bank Street.

256
00:17:42,012 --> 00:17:45,413
-You can go, but l'm coming with you.
-Okay. Let's go.

257
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:48,315
-See you, Morgue Man.
-Are you coming?

258
00:17:48,385 --> 00:17:51,684
No. Go ahead and go.
There's something l need to take care of.

259
00:17:51,755 --> 00:17:52,744
Ok.

260
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:05,666
You took my seat.
l was sitting there yesterday.

261
00:18:07,704 --> 00:18:11,196
l just wanted to let you know that
Harrison won't be showing up today.

262
00:18:11,274 --> 00:18:14,710
Good old Tru.
At least she's gonna make this sporting.

263
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:21,775
So, why don't you tell me
what you really want.

264
00:18:23,053 --> 00:18:24,953
l just want to hear it for myself.

265
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,922
-What's that?
-Who you are. What you can do.

266
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:31,624
How you can live with yourself.

267
00:18:34,497 --> 00:18:36,294
l respect you, Davis.

268
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,358
You're a man of science.
You want answers, conclusions.

269
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:42,369
So how's this?

270
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:46,569
l preserve the order of the universe
by ensuring the cycle of life.

271
00:18:46,843 --> 00:18:50,279
Fate already has a representative, Jack,
and it is not you.

272
00:18:50,347 --> 00:18:53,976
Tru? Now this is where we're gonna have
to agree to disagree.

273
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,612
Because if Tru was serving fate,
why does fate need me?

274
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:01,953
-She helps people live.
-Who were supposed to die!

275
00:19:03,827 --> 00:19:07,194
Don't you see? She can't win.

276
00:19:07,263 --> 00:19:10,630
You're wrong.
l've seen her save people. She can win.

277
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,329
Yes. You've seen her outfox killers...

278
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:17,703
talk people off ledges,
and quite capably, l might add.

279
00:19:17,774 --> 00:19:21,835
But if you think that's the end of the story,
you're missing the best part.

280
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,310
What's that?

281
00:19:24,981 --> 00:19:27,211
l think we'll save that for another time.

282
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:29,615
Wouldn't want to blow
all my best material at once.

283
00:19:29,686 --> 00:19:31,984
But it's good to see you, boss.

284
00:19:32,522 --> 00:19:35,013
Tell Harrison l'll catch him later.

285
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:40,252
lf l see him in my place again,
l'll call the cops.

286
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,060
Yes, sir. Not a problem. Come on, buddy.

287
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:51,502
lf you're hungry, you call me.
l'm, like, VlP at all the restaurants in town.

288
00:19:51,574 --> 00:19:55,271
Forget candy bars.
l'm talking steak and tiramisu.

289
00:19:56,913 --> 00:20:01,077
This is my sister. She's cool. She's....
Well, she looks out for me.

290
00:20:01,718 --> 00:20:04,243
-Kind of how l look out for you.
-Hi, Ethan.

291
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,309
Hi.

292
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,455
-You're not gonna tell my mother, are you?
-Not a chance!

293
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:10,049
-You are.
-What?

294
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:13,953
Yeah, we'll take you home.
Where do you live?

295
00:20:14,564 --> 00:20:19,058
lt's a few blocks. l can go on my own.
Come on, buddy, just tell me where.

296
00:20:19,402 --> 00:20:21,870
Fine. l live on Bank Street.

297
00:20:22,105 --> 00:20:25,165
But she's probably not even home
from work yet.

298
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:28,878
-Did you say Bank Street?
-Yeah, <i>9</i>5 Bank Street.

299
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:33,912
Ethan, do you think your mom would
mind picking you up at my office?

300
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:40,116
Why don't you guys wait in Sign-ln
until Ethan's mom gets here?

301
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,421
-Where you going?
-l hear Davis in the crypt. l'll be right back.

302
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:46,155
And just do me a favor?
Don't play with anything.

303
00:20:46,229 --> 00:20:48,823
-l won't.
-l was talking to him.

304
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:53,324
Davis.

305
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:58,573
Sorry if l got your hopes up. l just came by
to give my two-week notice.

306
00:20:59,142 --> 00:21:03,545
Don't bother. Davis took you off payroll
once we realized you were Death.

307
00:21:03,613 --> 00:21:07,276
l'm not Death, Tru.
l don't determine who lives or dies.

308
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:11,343
lt's my job to bring a little order
to the universe.

309
00:21:11,588 --> 00:21:14,887
Which means today your job is
to make sure my brother dies.

310
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:18,724
-l take no pleasure in that.
-Oh, l'm sure. Later, Jack.

311
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,066
What if l let him live?

312
00:21:28,938 --> 00:21:32,066
For a guy who claims he isn't Death,
you sure talk a good game.

313
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:35,133
l like your brother. l'd hate to see him die.

314
00:21:35,578 --> 00:21:39,878
l'd hate to see you see him die...again.

315
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:43,748
Death's Top 10 Come-Ons.

316
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,187
Number 10:
promise to spare the life of a relative.

317
00:21:47,257 --> 00:21:49,282
l also hate reliving days.

318
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,354
l mean, the first time was cool,
but after that, dull as dishwater.

319
00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:57,024
Number nine: bitch about the job,
and then invite her back to your place...

320
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,658
to see your new black robe.

321
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:01,431
You know what l hate
more than anything?

322
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,934
The way you're looking at me right now.

323
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:11,612
So l won't stand in the way
of you saving Harrison.

324
00:22:11,681 --> 00:22:13,546
-lf?
-lf you stop.

325
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:18,917
The next time someone asks for your help,
ignore it.

326
00:22:19,722 --> 00:22:22,885
lf your day should rewind, have fun.

327
00:22:23,226 --> 00:22:27,162
But don't save the life
of someone whose time is up.

328
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:32,723
-Think about it.
-l don't have to think about it, Jack.

329
00:22:33,202 --> 00:22:36,433
l can save my brother
and anyone else who needs me.

330
00:22:36,506 --> 00:22:38,906
ls that how you think this works?

331
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:44,105
When you save someone who's supposed
to die, there are consequences.

332
00:22:44,714 --> 00:22:48,411
The universe
keeps very strict accounts, Tru.

333
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:51,681
And what you're doing is messing
with the books.

334
00:22:52,922 --> 00:22:56,551
So if you save Harrison,
the one certainty is...

335
00:22:56,626 --> 00:23:00,995
someone else is gonna die today
in his place.

336
00:23:01,064 --> 00:23:04,830
-lt doesn't work like that.
-l guess we'll see.

337
00:23:06,536 --> 00:23:10,495
Twelve hours till midnight.
And l'm sitting on the edge of my seat...

338
00:23:10,573 --> 00:23:15,306
because l know someone's
gonna die today. Could be anyone.

339
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,470
-lt could be you.
-Or you.

340
00:23:18,548 --> 00:23:21,073
-l guess we'll see.
-l guess we will.

341
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:25,951
Say goodbye to Harrison for me.

342
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:30,025
Read into that any way you'd like.

343
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,342
Yes! That's good!

344
00:23:47,944 --> 00:23:50,879
-Mom.
-There you are. Ethan.

345
00:23:53,082 --> 00:23:56,518
You can always call me, no matter what.
You understand?

346
00:23:56,586 --> 00:24:00,022
Hi, l'm Harrison. l know we only spoke on--

347
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:02,990
On the phone. Right. lt's nice to meet you.

348
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:07,218
-Well, what can l say? Thank you so much.
-Oh, no problem.

349
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:08,924
Emma.

350
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:13,031
-Hi. Have we met?
-No, l'm Tru, Harrison's sister.

351
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,968
Hey, Harry, you want to just give us a sec?

352
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,028
Oh, yeah.

353
00:24:18,775 --> 00:24:20,766
Girl talk. Dude, come on.

354
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,141
He worships your brother.

355
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:28,172
All l've heard for the last week is,
''Harrison this, Harrison that.''

356
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:30,981
lt must be really tough raising him
on your own.

357
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:33,887
Yeah. His father and l
split up six months ago.

358
00:24:33,956 --> 00:24:37,084
Harrison may be the first
stable role model he's ever had.

359
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,355
Not exactly Donnie's strong suit.

360
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:41,863
-Being a role model?
-Being stable.

361
00:24:46,002 --> 00:24:48,402
Could you just excuse me one sec?

362
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:56,610
Emma's got a jealous ex. But she
and Harrison never even met until today.

363
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:59,876
-He must've taken Ethan home and--
-Wrong place, wrong time. Right.

364
00:24:59,949 --> 00:25:03,749
You're doing everything you need to do.
Keeping Harrison away from Bank Street.

365
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,754
-What about them?
-They're safe.

366
00:25:05,822 --> 00:25:09,690
The only person in danger is the guy
he thinks is sleeping with his ex-wife.

367
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:12,250
lt still couldn't hurt
to keep an eye on the house.

368
00:25:12,328 --> 00:25:14,091
But wait, Davis. You?

369
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:16,658
From across the street.

370
00:25:16,733 --> 00:25:20,931
lf there's any real work to be done
l'll call you. l'm not doing that stuff.

371
00:25:21,003 --> 00:25:22,732
l'll see you later.

372
00:25:26,976 --> 00:25:29,638
Tru, you were awesome! You did it!

373
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,442
You saved me! l knew it!
l always knew you could do it.

374
00:25:33,516 --> 00:25:35,677
Hey, we're not out of the woods yet, Har.

375
00:25:35,752 --> 00:25:39,848
Come on! You said it yourself. Stay away
from Bank Street and l am bullet-free.

376
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,516
So what's next? 'Cause l'm starving.

377
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:46,023
This whole dying and coming back thing
really works on my appetite.

378
00:25:46,095 --> 00:25:49,360
Stop! Listen to me!
Look, you don't remember yesterday.

379
00:25:49,432 --> 00:25:53,425
You don't have to, but l do.
l stood over your body. Your dead body.

380
00:25:53,503 --> 00:25:56,802
And l will not lose you again,
do you understand me?

381
00:25:57,907 --> 00:26:00,398
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

382
00:26:02,078 --> 00:26:04,979
So let's go.
l'm taking you somewhere safe.

383
00:26:05,715 --> 00:26:08,149
Safe? What could be safer than a morgue?

384
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:13,350
We're gathered here today to celebrate
the union of two people.

385
00:26:13,422 --> 00:26:17,859
FYl. Given a choice between death
and attending my ex's wedding...

386
00:26:18,561 --> 00:26:20,028
l might have chosen death.

387
00:26:20,096 --> 00:26:21,927
And in celebration of that love...

388
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:26,731
the bride has asked her friend, Tru Davies,
to read for us a passage today. Tru?

389
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:30,802
-l'll be right back.
-l'll be right here.

390
00:26:40,449 --> 00:26:42,110
-What's his name?
-Stop it, Donnie.

391
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:45,450
-We've been through this many times.
-We've been divorced six months.

392
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:46,988
You already found a replacement?

393
00:26:47,056 --> 00:26:49,422
You know how crazy this is?
How crazy you sound?

394
00:26:49,492 --> 00:26:51,016
-Who is he?
-There's no one!

395
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:54,426
l haven't been out on a date since
high school, and that was with you.

396
00:26:54,497 --> 00:26:56,829
-Don't lie to me, Emma !
-Oh, my God!

397
00:26:56,899 --> 00:26:58,890
Would you stop that and put that away.

398
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:00,959
-My buddy saw him.
-Daddy?

399
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:04,840
Hey, Eth. l didn't know you were....

400
00:27:06,175 --> 00:27:10,612
-Mommy and Daddy, we were just talking.
-You should leave, Donnie. Now.

401
00:27:11,013 --> 00:27:12,002
Yeah.

402
00:27:12,615 --> 00:27:16,051
Hey, look, Daddy's gonna come see you
real soon, okay?

403
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:21,356
l'm gonna find this guy.
Don't think l won't.

404
00:27:21,657 --> 00:27:23,249
Goodbye, Donnie.

405
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:30,526
Hey, honey.

406
00:27:34,604 --> 00:27:36,196
Watch where you're going.

407
00:27:36,272 --> 00:27:39,366
l know where l'm going.
The question is, do you?

408
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:44,036
-What the hell's that supposed to mean?
-Donnie McCrane?

409
00:27:44,113 --> 00:27:46,638
-Yeah?
-Jack Harper.

410
00:27:46,716 --> 00:27:49,810
Sacred Heart Basketball League!
Come on, l was the point guard.

411
00:27:49,886 --> 00:27:54,255
We beat St. Anthony's for 30 points
back in '<i>9</i>1 . You must remember.

412
00:27:54,323 --> 00:27:56,553
Sorry, Jack? No.

413
00:27:56,826 --> 00:27:59,488
Hey, l was sorry
to hear about your divorce, man.

414
00:27:59,562 --> 00:28:02,827
Some of the guys were talking about it.
l've been through it myself.

415
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:04,161
lt sucks, doesn't it?

416
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:07,964
They leave you for some young stud,
and we get left paying the bills.

417
00:28:08,037 --> 00:28:10,835
Anyway, l was sorry to hear it.
But keep your chin up.

418
00:28:10,907 --> 00:28:13,808
You're a much better-looking guy
than he is.

419
00:28:16,545 --> 00:28:18,206
Hey. You know him?

420
00:28:19,582 --> 00:28:22,949
-You know the guy Emma's seeing?
-Know him? Oh, yeah.

421
00:28:23,185 --> 00:28:26,348
Not only that,
l know where he is right now.

422
00:28:40,503 --> 00:28:44,564
Come on, Tru.
Pick up the phone. Pick it up. Come on.

423
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:48,272
-Sorry, Davis.
-Give me that!

424
00:28:48,344 --> 00:28:50,437
This is between me and Tru.

425
00:28:59,855 --> 00:29:02,187
''here is the deepest secret nobody knows

426
00:29:02,258 --> 00:29:05,489
''and this is the wonder
that's keeping the stars apart

427
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:08,820
''i carry your heart (i carry it in my heart)''

428
00:29:32,888 --> 00:29:35,982
l can't tell you how surprised l was
to see you.

429
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:39,651
Lindsay called, and she said
she hadn't heard from you all day.

430
00:29:39,729 --> 00:29:44,098
She had a nagging suspicion her best
friend was gonna go stag to her wedding.

431
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:48,667
Well, that's why she's my best friend.
She knows what l want.

432
00:29:54,276 --> 00:29:58,076
lt can't be easy for him,
seeing Lindsay marry somebody else.

433
00:29:58,314 --> 00:30:00,612
lt beats the alternative.

434
00:30:00,816 --> 00:30:03,084
-What's that?
-lt's a long story.

435
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,119
l'm not going anywhere.

436
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:09,989
You haven't heard the story yet.

437
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:16,225
Okay. l promised you answers.

438
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:20,189
Explanations that are long overdue.

439
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:21,594
So here goes.

440
00:30:25,006 --> 00:30:27,975
Harrison's here today
because l'm saving his life.

441
00:30:28,176 --> 00:30:30,076
You're saving his life?

442
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:34,445
Yesterday he was shot, and he died.

443
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:38,875
He asked for my help, and my day
restarted, and so l'm helping him...

444
00:30:38,954 --> 00:30:43,414
because that's what l do.
l help people live who aren't ready to die.

445
00:30:45,493 --> 00:30:50,123
And when we were together,
if l ever showed up late, or ran off early...

446
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:53,964
or acted in some inexplicable way,
it was because someone needed me.

447
00:30:54,035 --> 00:30:56,697
-Because someone needed my--
-Your help.

448
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,931
Right.

449
00:30:59,174 --> 00:31:02,803
And l never told you this before,
because l know how it sounds...

450
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:07,543
but l can do all of those things.
Every one of them.

451
00:31:08,183 --> 00:31:12,142
Excuse me, everyone.
Before we move inside for dinner...

452
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,714
l would like to make a toast...

453
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:18,225
to my beautiful bride, Lindsay...

454
00:31:19,227 --> 00:31:20,216
who has--

455
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,489
Luc. Luc.

456
00:31:21,563 --> 00:31:22,757
accepted me for who l am.

457
00:31:24,332 --> 00:31:27,324
And has made my life richer because of it.

458
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:32,335
-To Lindsay.
-Hear, hear.

459
00:31:36,077 --> 00:31:37,066
Harrison.

460
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,644
Look, l told you, buddy.
l didn't sleep with your wife.

461
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:46,243
-That's not what l heard.
-l'm telling you the truth!

462
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,812
-Honest! Ask anybody! Ask--
-Your son!

463
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,016
Who are you?

464
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:52,355
Someone who knows
the same thing that Ethan does.

465
00:31:52,427 --> 00:31:55,692
My brother met your ex-wife
for the first time today.

466
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,628
You may not believe me,
but you have to believe your son.

467
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,692
Look, you're mixed up. l get it.

468
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:05,001
l just had to watch the woman l love
marry another man.

469
00:32:05,073 --> 00:32:09,134
Okay, l know how you feel,
but l'm not the guy you're looking for.

470
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:14,742
Honest.

471
00:32:18,553 --> 00:32:21,283
You better both be telling me the truth.

472
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:31,425
-lt's okay.
-Yeah.

473
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:38,532
Do me a favor and keep an eye on him.
There's just one more thing l gotta do.

474
00:33:06,434 --> 00:33:10,928
-That's a little harsh, don't you think?
-Actually, l'm not so sure it is.

475
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:14,798
Let me guess.
She's in love with someone else.

476
00:33:16,945 --> 00:33:19,038
l wish it were that simple.

477
00:33:22,183 --> 00:33:26,313
-l can see you need some alone time, so--
-She seemed so normal at first.

478
00:33:26,388 --> 00:33:29,016
l mean, she's pretty and smart and....

479
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:31,982
You know what? Forget it.

480
00:33:33,661 --> 00:33:34,650
Hey.

481
00:33:34,996 --> 00:33:36,623
Sorry for prying.

482
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:41,362
Okay, no, how about this?
And l can't believe l'm even repeating it.

483
00:33:42,504 --> 00:33:44,995
She thinks dead people talk to her.

484
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,175
-Yeah, she thinks that she--
-Relives days.

485
00:33:51,012 --> 00:33:54,413
-How did you know that?
-She told me, too. This morning.

486
00:33:54,482 --> 00:33:56,541
lt was a practice run for you, l think.

487
00:33:56,618 --> 00:34:00,816
-And, yeah, it did sound crazy at first.
-Yeah.

488
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:05,519
Until l got some proof.
And suddenly it didn't seem so crazy.

489
00:34:05,593 --> 00:34:08,221
lt sounded miraculous.

490
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:11,088
-You got proof?
-Oh, yeah.

491
00:34:11,433 --> 00:34:15,767
Tru sent me to talk to this woman, Emma.
She lives over on Bank Street.

492
00:34:15,837 --> 00:34:19,705
-<i>9</i>5 Bank Street.
-And what did she tell you, Emma?

493
00:34:20,008 --> 00:34:23,500
Well, l'm not really sure
l can do it justice...

494
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:27,009
but somehow she made everything clear.

495
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,713
Don't take my word for it.
Just go talk to her yourself.

496
00:34:31,786 --> 00:34:33,447
l don't know, man.

497
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,251
-Bank Street?
-Yeah.

498
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,451
Yeah. Why not.

499
00:34:43,198 --> 00:34:45,496
The things we do for love, huh?

500
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:49,503
And this Emma is a bit of an odd bird.

501
00:34:49,571 --> 00:34:53,837
She tends to be more talkative if you go
over there without being empty-handed.

502
00:34:53,908 --> 00:34:56,342
You know what l'm saying?
Learn from my mistake.

503
00:34:56,411 --> 00:34:58,140
Flowers. Not candy.

504
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,507
Women.

505
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:06,913
-Great. Thanks, Jack.
-Any time.

506
00:35:21,569 --> 00:35:23,799
So, your brother's gonna live.

507
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,833
Yes, he is. No thanks to you.

508
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:33,574
-Would it ring hollow to say l'm glad?
-Would it ring hollow to say l don't care?

509
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,010
Unfortunately, someone still has
to die today.

510
00:35:37,085 --> 00:35:39,849
Try not to sound
so broken up about it, Jack.

511
00:35:39,954 --> 00:35:42,548
l'm really sorry, Tru. Like l said...

512
00:35:42,857 --> 00:35:47,590
there are parts of my job that sometimes
don't make me feel good about myself.

513
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:02,369
-What did you do to him?
-l didn't do anything. You did.

514
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:06,703
You told him who you are.
l just told him where he could get proof.

515
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,684
Emma? Come on, open up. Look, l'm sorry.

516
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:26,093
Ethan? You guys home? Hello?

517
00:36:36,244 --> 00:36:37,370
Safe? What?

518
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,434
[knocking on door]

519
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,442
-Can l help you?
-Yeah, l'm looking for Emma.

520
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,683
-She's not here right now. And you are?
-l'm Luc.

521
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:54,528
Nice flowers.

522
00:36:56,064 --> 00:37:00,558
-You a friend of Emma's, Luc?
-No, actually we've never even met before.

523
00:37:01,903 --> 00:37:05,634
Okay, why don't we try this again,
and how about the truth this time?

524
00:37:05,707 --> 00:37:08,198
Are you a friend of my wife's, Luc?

525
00:37:18,286 --> 00:37:21,517
-l think there's been some kind of mistake.
-Yeah, and you made it.

526
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:25,286
Was it worth it? l know she's good,
but was she worth your life, Luc?

527
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,694
l understand that you are upset,
but l have never met your wife before.

528
00:37:29,764 --> 00:37:33,598
Then why do l see you, the two of you,
in my bed, and it makes me sick!

529
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,603
-lt makes me want to--
-No, Donnie, please! Put the gun down.

530
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,502
-Listen to me.
-He's sleeping with her.

531
00:37:38,573 --> 00:37:42,339
-No, he's not. lt's all a misunderstanding.
-Tru, get out of here.

532
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,935
Donnie, please listen to me.
We'll all talk this out.

533
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,004
-l can't lose her.
-Now, l can handle this!

534
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:49,811
-Donnie, don't do this!
-Tru, get out of here! Tru, go!

535
00:37:49,884 --> 00:37:52,580
-l'm so sorry.
-Please! Donnie, don't do this.

536
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:54,554
Please, no! Donnie, no!

537
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:20,479
Luc. Look at me.

538
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,646
-You're okay.
-l'm sorry, l didn't believe you.

539
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,243
No, Luc. Come on, it's gonna be fine.
l'll get help.

540
00:38:26,321 --> 00:38:28,846
Just stay with me. Look at me, okay?

541
00:38:31,993 --> 00:38:33,585
l love you, Tru.

542
00:38:34,362 --> 00:38:37,763
No, please, don't, Luc.
Please just stay with me.

543
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:41,029
You're gonna be fine. Look at me.

544
00:38:41,669 --> 00:38:43,102
Look at me, please!

545
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,429
Luc.

546
00:38:48,943 --> 00:38:51,707
Luc, come on, please don't.

547
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:22,673
ln certain hope of the resurrection
to eternal life through our Lord...

548
00:39:22,744 --> 00:39:26,737
we commend to almighty God
our brother Luc Johnston.

549
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:29,575
And we commit his body to the ground.

550
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:34,516
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

551
00:39:35,656 --> 00:39:37,988
The Lord bless him and keep him.

552
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:42,956
The Lord make his face to shine upon him,
and be gracious unto him...

553
00:39:43,698 --> 00:39:46,064
and give him peace. Amen.

554
00:40:10,057 --> 00:40:11,718
l owe you my life.

555
00:40:14,429 --> 00:40:15,760
Thank you.

556
00:40:17,632 --> 00:40:20,965
ls there any chance that he'll ask?

557
00:40:23,738 --> 00:40:27,401
Don't know. Don't think so.

558
00:40:39,921 --> 00:40:41,821
-Wait here.
-Don't, Tru.

559
00:40:49,831 --> 00:40:51,799
l take no pleasure from being right.

560
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,357
lt's my turn to talk, so listen up.

561
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:58,297
My mother had the calling,
and she passed it on to me.

562
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:02,331
lf you think for one minute that
l'm ever gonna stop, you're wrong.

563
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:05,908
So you'd better watch your back, buddy,
because it's on.

564
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,973
You should know one thing.
This is bigger than you think.

565
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:14,545
And you should know one thing.
You have no idea what you've begun.

566
00:41:46,988 --> 00:41:48,580
l love you, too.

567
00:42:01,969 --> 00:42:03,163
Get in.

568
00:42:09,043 --> 00:42:11,773
So, tell me, what does my daughter know?

569
00:42:12,346 --> 00:42:14,576
Nice to see you, too, Richard.

570
00:42:15,983 --> 00:42:18,918
Why don't l start
with what she doesn't know.

571
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,247
That you once did what l do.

572
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:26,455
She's tough.
You'll have your work cut out for you.

573
00:42:27,261 --> 00:42:30,924
-Just like l had with her mother.
-You won that one, didn't you?

574
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:33,733
Besides, l love a challenge.

575
00:42:37,171 --> 00:42:41,335
Well, Jack, l believe you've got one.
