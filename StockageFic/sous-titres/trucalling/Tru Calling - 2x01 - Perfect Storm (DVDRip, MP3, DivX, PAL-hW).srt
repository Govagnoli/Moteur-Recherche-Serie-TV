00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:04,773
<i>- Last season on</i> Tru Calling<i>:</i>
- In layman's terms...

2
00:00:04,933 --> 00:00:06,082
...I relive days.

3
00:00:06,293 --> 00:00:07,726
You relive days?

4
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:10,128
Jack, what you thought
was happening to you...

5
00:00:10,293 --> 00:00:11,567
...it happens to me.

6
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:13,325
- I just wonder sometimes.
- About...?

7
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:14,522
Consequences.

8
00:00:14,693 --> 00:00:15,887
Ripples in fate.

9
00:00:16,093 --> 00:00:17,651
He is not like you.

10
00:00:17,813 --> 00:00:19,485
He is the opposite of you.

11
00:00:19,693 --> 00:00:21,923
- You save lives and he...
- Takes them.

12
00:00:22,213 --> 00:00:24,010
You have no idea what you're doing.

13
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:26,681
You save someone who shouldn't
be here, there are consequences.

14
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:29,726
You think I'm messing up
some grand plan? Maybe I am the plan!

15
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:32,004
What's gonna keep us from
going in the same circles?

16
00:00:32,213 --> 00:00:34,488
This weekend, let's talk.

17
00:00:34,693 --> 00:00:36,524
About everything.

18
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:38,132
Okay.

20
00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:41,245
Oh, Luc. Look at me.

21
00:00:41,453 --> 00:00:42,852
Come on.

22
00:00:48,693 --> 00:00:51,207
My mother had the calling,
and she passed it on to me.

23
00:00:51,373 --> 00:00:54,729
If you think for one minute
that I am ever gonna stop, you're wrong.

24
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:58,528
You should know one thing.
This is bigger than you think.

25
00:00:59,013 --> 00:01:00,969
You have no idea what you've begun.

26
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:04,448
Get in.

27
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:06,530
Tell me,
what does my daughter know?

28
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:11,409
Why don't I start with what she doesn't
know. That you once did what I do.

29
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,365
She's tough.
You'll have your work cut out for you.

30
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,212
- I love a challenge.
- Well, Jack...

31
00:01:16,373 --> 00:01:18,011
...I believe you've got one.

33
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:31,683
- <i>Hello?</i>
- All right, I'm here.

34
00:01:32,453 --> 00:01:36,002
We've been though this, Tru.
You know exactly what to do.

35
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,244
- Okay, I'm in.
- <i>Okay, good.</i>

36
00:01:40,413 --> 00:01:42,643
<i>Now, remember where you need to go.</i>

37
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,242
- Johnson, 201.
- I don't see it.

38
00:01:45,413 --> 00:01:49,372
Turn left, third door on the right.
And relax, you're good at this.

39
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:52,331
This is what you were meant to do.

40
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:55,931
I'm here, Davis. I made it.

41
00:01:56,093 --> 00:01:58,209
<i>I can 't believe it.</i>

42
00:01:58,373 --> 00:02:00,489
First day of med school.

43
00:02:00,693 --> 00:02:01,967
Yeah, almost.

44
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:03,532
<i>What do you mean "almost"?</i>

45
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:07,288
Well, I'm only auditing. If it wasn't
for all those strings you pulled...

46
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:10,166
- <i>Tru, Tru, listen.</i>
- What?

47
00:02:10,693 --> 00:02:13,161
It's okay to be proud of yourself.

48
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,530
Thanks, Davis. Bye.

50
00:02:22,653 --> 00:02:24,132
- Harrison.
- <i>It's me.</i>

51
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:27,131
- I've got some interesting news.
- You found Jack?

52
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,801
No, one-track mind,
I haven't found Jack.

53
00:02:29,973 --> 00:02:32,123
Forgive me.
When someone kills my boyfriend...

54
00:02:32,293 --> 00:02:34,568
...then disappears for two months,
I get obsessed.

55
00:02:34,773 --> 00:02:37,890
It's a good point. It's a good point,
but no. Dad's in town.

56
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:41,086
- Dad?
- Okay, everyone, take your seats.

57
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:43,369
<i>Yeah, he wants to have lunch.</i>
<i>Wouldn 't say why.</i>

58
00:02:43,653 --> 00:02:46,963
Hey, listen, I really gotta run.
I'm gonna be late for another delivery.

59
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:50,762
Oh. Might wanna congratulate me.

60
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:54,209
Six weeks on a job.
It's a personal best.

61
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:56,563
- Congrats, Harry.
- Ms. Davies?

62
00:02:56,973 --> 00:02:59,203
I gotta go. Yes, professor.

63
00:02:59,373 --> 00:03:03,924
Just because your coroner friend
used his pull to get you into my class...

64
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:06,886
...doesn't mean you won't be held
to the same standards as real students.

65
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:10,966
- Real students? I am a real student.
- Okay.

66
00:03:11,173 --> 00:03:15,928
Perhaps you'd care to tell me which
artery terminates as a nasopalatine artery.

67
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:18,526
I, uh...

68
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:24,525
It's a maxillary artery. You're
in medical school now, Ms. Davies.

69
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:28,362
You only have one decision to make. Are
you committed to saving lives or not?

70
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:33,890
- Yes, I'm committed.
- How reassuring for all of us.

71
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:37,529
Now, moving on to things
that actually matter...

72
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,324
- Are you moving here?
- Crime's up.

73
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:47,048
Business is good for a defense attorney.
An office in the city was a natural.

74
00:03:47,213 --> 00:03:49,602
- What about Jordan and the kids?
- Weekends.

75
00:03:50,613 --> 00:03:52,251
It's not ideal, but they understand.

76
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:56,207
So tell me, how's Tru doing?

77
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:59,967
I know how upset she was
after what happened to Luc.

78
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:03,762
She's tough. She'll feel better
once she finds out who killed him.

79
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:07,323
Promise me something:
You won't let her get too obsessed.

80
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:10,371
It's too late.

81
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,606
Enough small talk.
I wanna tell you why I asked you here.

82
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:17,923
Since I'm opening an office,
I need some help.

83
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:21,808
Investigators, researchers,
resourceful young people.

84
00:04:21,973 --> 00:04:23,850
Like yourself.

85
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:27,368
Wait, are you offering me a job?

86
00:04:28,573 --> 00:04:29,847
What do you say?

87
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:32,650
Wanna come work for the old man?

88
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:38,528
- You turned it down?
- Yeah. I told you, I got a job.

89
00:04:38,693 --> 00:04:42,402
And I know it might not be glamorous,
but it's legit.

90
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:45,087
And it's mine. I did it on my own.

91
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:48,370
You know, what's funny is,
my whole life, I just wished Dad...

92
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:53,527
...would start acting like a real father.
And now that he is, I don't need him.

93
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:58,084
- Oh, no. No, no. Wait, wait.
- What's wrong?

94
00:04:58,253 --> 00:05:01,643
What...? The van. The van.
I parked it right here, the company van.

95
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:03,804
- Is it towed?
- No, no, not towed.

96
00:05:03,973 --> 00:05:06,168
I fed the meter and everything. What...?

97
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:09,763
Glass. Broken glass.
Somebody stole it.

98
00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:12,123
They stole it, Tru. They stole the...

99
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,128
Oh!

100
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:18,172
Personal business. Personal business.
I'm cooked. They're gonna can me, Tru.

101
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,405
- Okay, just relax, okay? Just...
- Relax? Look, I love that job.

102
00:05:21,573 --> 00:05:23,848
I'm good at it. Damn it.

103
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:27,847
You see that? You see what happens?
I try to live an honest life, and look.

104
00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:30,123
We'll think of something,
I promise, okay?

105
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,403
Just call in sick,
and I promise you we'Il...

107
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:37,410
- What?
- <i>Hey, I think your guy's here.</i>

108
00:05:37,613 --> 00:05:39,331
- <i>Took 10 grand off me.</i>
- Right now?

109
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:42,565
- <i>Yeah. I'll stall him if you want.</i>
- Okay, cool. All right, thanks.

110
00:05:42,773 --> 00:05:45,333
- Hey, that was my bookie.
- Uh, about the honest life...

111
00:05:45,493 --> 00:05:46,812
Let me finish.

112
00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:50,570
Someone matching Jack's description
showed up to collect 10 big ones.

113
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:52,843
- Where?
- 111 Grand Street.

114
00:05:53,013 --> 00:05:54,731
He's stalling him till you get there.

115
00:05:54,893 --> 00:05:58,966
But, hey, what you are you gonna do
when you get there? Tru. Tru!

117
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:44,531
You're welcome.

119
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:49,290
What the hell was that, Jack?

120
00:06:50,253 --> 00:06:53,404
Tru. What a nice surprise.

121
00:06:55,613 --> 00:06:58,252
Kids today. Not even a thank-you.

122
00:06:59,013 --> 00:07:01,766
So, what, now you save lives?

123
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:05,164
One, who's to say that truck
would've actually killed her?

124
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,847
And two, why do you look
so surprised?

125
00:07:08,013 --> 00:07:10,447
Because you take lives,
you don't save them.

126
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:15,204
I guess you don't listen so well, Tru.
I preserve fate.

127
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:20,083
Until a day restarts,
I'm no different than him or her...

128
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:22,609
...or you.
- Oh, you are different.

129
00:07:22,773 --> 00:07:25,970
I don't kill someone's boyfriend
and then disappear for two months.

130
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,810
Living in the past can be so debilitating,
don't you think?

131
00:07:30,013 --> 00:07:32,288
You thought killing Luc
would make me stop?

132
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,364
Well, guess what,
it only made me stronger.

133
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:37,525
Preaching to the choir.
I saw you myself all summer.

134
00:07:37,693 --> 00:07:41,208
All those people fated to die
that you saved.

135
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:45,207
That's right. I didn't lose once.
While you did what, exactly?

136
00:07:45,413 --> 00:07:48,211
- Traveled. Relaxed.
- Death took a holiday?

138
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:52,093
But you know what I did
more than anything, Tru?

139
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:55,928
I hoped. I hoped that you would
come to your senses.

140
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:59,005
I hoped that you would find a way
to stop saving people...

141
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:00,492
...who are supposed to die.

142
00:08:00,693 --> 00:08:03,969
Correction, who are supposed to live.

143
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:06,249
Don't you see? I gave you a gift.

144
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:09,007
I gave you the perfect excuse
to walk away.

145
00:08:09,213 --> 00:08:11,807
Actually, you gave me
every reason to stay.

146
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:16,807
So here we are.

147
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:21,165
Right back where we started.

148
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:25,205
Later, Tru. Catch you on the rewind.

149
00:08:25,373 --> 00:08:29,332
- I'll be waiting.
- Unless I get there first.

150
00:08:46,253 --> 00:08:47,652
Help me.

151
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:07,483
He's back, Davis.
He's come back to stop me.

152
00:09:07,653 --> 00:09:10,690
You're ready. Nothing to worry about.
You're prepared for this.

153
00:09:10,853 --> 00:09:13,208
Okay. So why do you look so worried?

154
00:09:13,373 --> 00:09:15,011
I'm not worried. I'm curious.

155
00:09:15,173 --> 00:09:17,289
Was she surprised to see you?

156
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:21,765
I think there's some bigger surprises in
store for her, Richard, wouldn't you say?

157
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:25,929
Look, I told you, I can handle her.
You don't need to move here.

158
00:09:26,093 --> 00:09:28,561
And I told you, Jack,
I know my daughter.

159
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:31,921
And you're gonna need
all the help you can get.

160
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:35,250
I have plenty of help.
You. Harrison, if need be.

161
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:38,883
But this is my calling, a job
I was chosen to do. I can beat him.

162
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:42,409
Are you ready?
Because I'm certain she is.

163
00:09:42,573 --> 00:09:44,882
Oh, you're proud of her. That's cute.

164
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:48,013
But I gave her a chance to stop,
and she didn't take it.

165
00:09:48,173 --> 00:09:50,323
- So I'll stop her myself.
- Confidence.

166
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,893
You remind me of myself
when I had your job.

167
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,882
Except I won.

168
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:01,930
Until the day restarts, you've done
all you can. I gotta get upstairs.

169
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:03,924
I'm running late
for my psych evaluation.

170
00:10:04,093 --> 00:10:06,482
Right, with the staff shrink.
Good luck, Davis.

171
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:09,486
Well, it's just a formality.
Tom Jordan and I are old friends.

172
00:10:09,653 --> 00:10:12,213
Tom's been representing me for years.

173
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,131
- Okay, Tom, let's get this over with.
- "Get this over with"?

174
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:26,083
- Oh, I'm looking for Tom Jordan.
- He's gone on indefinite medical leave.

175
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,729
- Oh, I didn't know he was sick.
- Yeah.

176
00:10:29,893 --> 00:10:34,967
Oh. I'm sorry, how rude. I'm Dr. Carrie
Allen. I'm his replacement.

177
00:10:35,173 --> 00:10:39,007
- And you must be...
- I'm Davis.

178
00:10:39,213 --> 00:10:41,010
Davis. Here.

179
00:10:43,293 --> 00:10:47,047
- You are two hours late, Dr. Davis.
- It's actually just Davis.

180
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:50,922
Oh. I actually assumed that you
weren't going to show up at all.

181
00:10:51,093 --> 00:10:56,645
No, I like psychological tests.
Ink blots and such. Call me crazy.

182
00:10:56,813 --> 00:10:58,849
I know you're probably nervous
about this.

183
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:02,170
But the wonderful thing about my test:
There are no wrong answers.

184
00:11:02,373 --> 00:11:03,931
- Okay.
- All I need you to do...

185
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:08,167
...is look at this picture and tell me
the first thing that pops into your head.

186
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,608
- No wrong answers?
- No wrong answers.

187
00:11:10,773 --> 00:11:16,689
That is the lost continent of Atlantis and
the puppy that I never got as a child.

188
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:25,092
Yeah, I think he should take the job,
Dad, but you know Harry.

189
00:11:25,253 --> 00:11:28,131
- He likes to do things on his own.
- Incoming.

190
00:11:28,293 --> 00:11:31,649
Right, Dad, but look, I gotta go.
I'll call you later, okay?

191
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:36,728
My father, Ward Cleaver
all of a sudden.

192
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:40,883
Oh, no. Cop.

193
00:11:41,053 --> 00:11:44,682
Harbor Patrol officer. She died
answering a distress call in the bay.

194
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:48,732
Kate Wilson responded to an SOS call
at 3:07 p.m.

195
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:52,249
Some college kids lost control
of a boat called the <i>Green Hornet</i>.

196
00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:55,684
- Sounds routine.
- Would've been.

197
00:11:55,853 --> 00:11:58,651
- Except for the white squall.
- White squall?

198
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,642
A storm that comes unexpectedly,
no real warning...

199
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:04,725
...till, bang, you're in the middle of it.

200
00:12:04,893 --> 00:12:07,282
- A swell knocked her overboard.
- What about her partner?

201
00:12:07,453 --> 00:12:10,650
Couldn't get to her. Waves were too
rough. It's a miracle he didn't drown.

203
00:12:11,973 --> 00:12:13,770
That'd be me. Duty calls.

204
00:12:15,493 --> 00:12:19,452
- She's all yours, Tru. See you.
- Later.

205
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:24,688
Lost consciousness
when hypothermia set in.

206
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:28,562
Fluid in her lungs. No surprise there.

207
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:31,529
Keep that up,
you won't need me here anymore.

208
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:34,251
- Yeah, that will be the day.
- No, I'm serious.

209
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:36,529
It's nice to know
if anything happens to me...

210
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:38,570
...that you could take over
on your own.

211
00:12:38,773 --> 00:12:42,368
- Look, is this about Jack?
- It's not about Jack. Jack.

212
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:44,728
- It's about Carrie.
- Carrie?

213
00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:47,282
Dr. Allen. Tom Jordan's replacement.

214
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:50,365
My psychological test
didn't go over too well...

215
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:53,172
...and she's requested more testing.

216
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,204
What does that mean?

217
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:58,649
- Could mean, you know, nothing.
- Or?

218
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:01,452
Or it could mean that I'm...

219
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:03,126
...crazy, clinically speaking.

220
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:06,685
And if the test results show that,
then I won't be here anymore.

221
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:09,321
- They won't let me.
- No, that's not possible.

222
00:13:10,773 --> 00:13:12,047
Actually, it is.

223
00:13:13,253 --> 00:13:17,724
First I get humiliated at med school,
then Jack shows up and now this.

224
00:13:17,893 --> 00:13:19,485
What next?

225
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,646
Save me.

226
00:13:30,973 --> 00:13:32,850
Here we go again.

227
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:36,045
- It's me.
- <i>Why are you calling now?</i>

228
00:13:36,253 --> 00:13:39,962
- You're not due in class for three hours.
- I know. It's one of those days.

229
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:42,931
- Okay. Who's the lucky victim?
- Kate Wilson, Harbor Patrol.

230
00:13:43,093 --> 00:13:44,492
She died in a white squall.

231
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:48,368
Whoa. You don't hear about that every
day. Need an address or something?

232
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:52,162
No, already got one. I did my homework.
She starts work any minute.

233
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,891
<i>Okay, what can I do for you?</i>

234
00:13:54,053 --> 00:13:57,363
You can listen very carefully, because
you missed quite a day yesterday.

235
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:59,444
Jack came back,
my father moved to town...

236
00:13:59,613 --> 00:14:01,205
<i>... and you flunked your psych exam.</i>

237
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,887
What? Tom Jordan
would never flunk me.

238
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,802
No, but his replacement would.
Dr. Carrie Allen, the new staff shrink.

239
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,526
What, a woman?

240
00:14:09,693 --> 00:14:13,971
Well, did I find her attractive?
Because if I did, that would explain a lot.

241
00:14:18,053 --> 00:14:19,406
Hey, Davis, I gotta go.

242
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:24,923
Stupid question.
Of course I found her attractive.

243
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:26,771
- Officer Wilson?
- Yes?

244
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,685
Hey, I'm Tru Davies.

245
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:32,129
I'm interested in Harbor Patrol,
I'm told you're the woman to talk to.

246
00:14:32,293 --> 00:14:34,807
- And who told you that?
- Question is, who didn't?

247
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:37,168
I've asked around,
and you've got a lot of fans.

248
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,369
Nice to see the checks
have been clearing.

249
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:42,730
I would love to pick your brain,
get some pointers on the exam.

250
00:14:42,893 --> 00:14:44,770
Kate, let's get a move on.

251
00:14:44,973 --> 00:14:48,204
I'm late for my patrol. But tell you what,
I have a lunch break at 1.

252
00:14:48,413 --> 00:14:50,881
Meet me here, and I'll tell you
what you need to know.

253
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:53,402
Great, thank you. I'll see you at 1.

254
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:08,410
- <i>Hey</i>.
- Hey, Harry, it's me.

255
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:11,041
That's so weird.
I was just about to call you.

256
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:15,087
- I know. That's why I called you first.
- <i>Oh, got it. One of those days.</i>

257
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:16,891
All right, what do I need to know?

258
00:15:17,053 --> 00:15:20,090
Just try to act surprised
when Dad offers you a job.

259
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:22,409
A job? Really?

260
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:26,088
- Well, did I take it?
<i>- No, you turned it down.</i>

261
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,761
But let the old man down easy.
He took it pretty hard.

262
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:31,766
Well, see, that's great,
because they love me at this job.

263
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:34,572
Yeah, well, maybe not for long.

264
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:38,087
What did I do?

265
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:41,168
Look, your van got stolen
while you were at lunch.

266
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:44,729
The day rewound before I talked to you
again. My advice is, move the van.

267
00:15:44,893 --> 00:15:46,451
<i>All right, consider it moved.</i>

268
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,922
Ms. Davies, good of you to join us.

269
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:51,129
- Yeah. I'm really sorry.
- Ms. Davies...

270
00:15:51,293 --> 00:15:54,808
...just because your coroner friend
used his pull to get you into my class...

271
00:15:54,973 --> 00:15:58,329
...doesn't mean you won't be held
to the same standards as real students.

272
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:02,128
- Real students? I am a real student.
- Okay.

273
00:16:02,573 --> 00:16:07,408
Then tell me, which artery terminates
at the nasopalatine artery?

274
00:16:07,573 --> 00:16:09,643
That would be the maxillary artery.

275
00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:14,086
Of course, the nasopalatine itself ends
as the posterior septal branches...

276
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:19,008
...after it crosses under the surface
of the sphenoid. Ballpark?

277
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:22,286
Yes. That's right.

278
00:16:24,293 --> 00:16:26,761
That's absolutely right.

279
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:36,484
There's nothing doing out here today.
What do you say we head back?

280
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,927
- What's that?
- Hold on, give them a second.

281
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:46,885
Go.

282
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:56,650
- Come on.
- I'm going in.

283
00:16:56,813 --> 00:16:58,087
Kate!

284
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:08,883
Come on.

285
00:17:14,853 --> 00:17:16,366
Come on, Kate.

286
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:29,167
You saved my life.

287
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:42,888
I have no idea what happened. I was just
paddling along, and next thing I knew...

288
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:45,886
- You're fine now. Everything's okay.
- You're a very lucky man.

289
00:17:46,053 --> 00:17:48,169
Don't I know it.

290
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,172
Thanks.

291
00:17:50,373 --> 00:17:55,083
The things we take for granted, huh?
Never a dull moment.

292
00:17:55,253 --> 00:17:56,925
Ow.

293
00:17:57,173 --> 00:17:59,050
Come here, let me see.

294
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:02,410
You must've smacked your head
when you tipped. Sit down.

295
00:18:03,573 --> 00:18:05,291
Thank God you were out there.

296
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:09,128
The last thing I remember is getting
in my kayak. Next thing, lights out.

297
00:18:09,293 --> 00:18:12,763
- Don't get on the water much, do you?
- What gave it away?

299
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:17,485
Well, the truth is, my sister's sailing
into town tonight...

300
00:18:17,653 --> 00:18:20,167
...and when we get together,
a boat race is inevitable.

301
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:24,770
So I figured I'd polish up on my skills
before she got into town.

302
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:29,324
Guess I'm getting a little old to let
the competitive spirit get the best of me.

303
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:33,890
Oh, where are my manners?
I'm... I'm Jack Harper.

304
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:35,890
- Hey. Kate Wilson.
- Hey.

305
00:18:36,053 --> 00:18:38,487
Maybe next time you should
just let your sister win by forfeit.

306
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:41,850
Well, thanks to you,
there will be a next time.

308
00:18:58,573 --> 00:19:00,325
Officer Wilson?

309
00:19:01,493 --> 00:19:03,609
- Yes, Mr. Harper?
- Um...

310
00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:08,608
Here's the deal. Believe it or not, you're
not the first person who saved my life.

311
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,286
I didn't save your life.

312
00:19:10,813 --> 00:19:15,125
The first person was a trauma surgeon
in Irvine, California.

313
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,767
Pulled a bullet out of my neck
and sutured arteries...

314
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:20,128
...so I wouldn't bleed to death.
- I'm sorry.

315
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:23,330
The point is, by the time
I came out of the coma...

316
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:26,007
...Dr. Trakk had been
transferred back East...

317
00:19:26,173 --> 00:19:29,563
...and I never got the chance to say
thank you. Not the right way, anyway.

318
00:19:29,773 --> 00:19:32,606
So I swore to myself
that if I was ever unlucky enough...

319
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:34,764
...to need someone
to save my life again...

320
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:38,648
...I would find a way
to express my gratitude properly.

321
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:41,807
Your kayak flipped.

322
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:45,682
Chances are, you would've pulled
yourself out if I hadn't come along.

323
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,605
Well, at least let me buy you lunch.

324
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:50,844
Lunch? Um...

325
00:19:55,253 --> 00:19:57,209
Let me get my things together and...

326
00:19:57,373 --> 00:20:01,082
- You can wait a moment?
- I got nothing but time.

327
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,925
Kate?

328
00:20:09,493 --> 00:20:12,246
- Oh, hi, Tru.
- Ready for that cup of coffee?

329
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:15,126
Oh, damn. I'm sorry,
it completely slipped my mind.

330
00:20:15,293 --> 00:20:18,012
I just made lunch plans
with Mr. Harper.

331
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:19,646
Hey.

332
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,924
Jack Harper.

333
00:20:22,093 --> 00:20:24,243
Officer Wilson just fished me
out of the bay.

334
00:20:24,453 --> 00:20:27,365
- What a shame.
- Tru's interested in joining Harbor Patrol.

335
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:28,522
Oh.

336
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:33,005
- Bored with your day job?
- Just looking for some new challenges.

337
00:20:33,213 --> 00:20:35,488
I see. Competition at work's
not to your liking.

338
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,287
It's fine. It's just not as good
as it thinks it is.

339
00:20:38,493 --> 00:20:42,452
Look, why don't we just reschedule.
I can meet you any morning next week.

340
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:44,683
- No, we can't.
- We can't?

341
00:20:44,893 --> 00:20:47,805
This entrance exam is next week,
and we really need to talk.

342
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:51,762
- And we will, just not right now.
- Kate, really, this is more complicated...

343
00:20:51,933 --> 00:20:54,811
Officer, if this lady's bothering you,
I could call someone.

344
00:20:55,013 --> 00:20:57,971
Thanks, I'm fine. Listen,
I don't know what your deal is...

345
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:01,091
...but do us both a favor
and find someone else to help you.

346
00:21:02,653 --> 00:21:03,972
I'm gonna put my things away.

347
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:05,805
- Meet you in the office?
- Okay.

348
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:11,968
Ah, the eager recruit. A classic.
Too bad it's not gonna work.

349
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:14,601
Too bad she didn't let you drown.

350
00:21:15,893 --> 00:21:18,282
You know, I missed this, Tru.
I really did.

351
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:20,603
You can be so entertaining
when you're losing.

352
00:21:20,773 --> 00:21:23,731
- You haven't won anything yet.
- No. No, I haven't.

353
00:21:23,893 --> 00:21:27,363
But the beauty of my job is,
I don't have to change anything.

354
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:29,922
I merely have to prevent you
from changing anything.

355
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:33,967
And from where I sit,
Kate's day is right on course.

356
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:36,442
Feeling pretty good about yourself
right about now?

357
00:21:36,613 --> 00:21:38,365
Yeah, I'm getting there.

358
00:21:38,573 --> 00:21:41,963
Anyway, it's been lovely to see you, Tru,
but I'm late for a lunch date.

359
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:45,842
And don't worry, I'll make sure
Kate's last meal is a memorable one.

360
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,049
No one should die
on an empty stomach.

361
00:21:56,613 --> 00:21:59,605
Look, the day is very young.
No reason you can't win this one.

362
00:21:59,773 --> 00:22:04,051
Two hours to go, Davis. Kate died after
answering an SOS at 3:07 yesterday.

363
00:22:04,213 --> 00:22:06,568
So far, I've done nothing
to change that.

364
00:22:06,773 --> 00:22:08,923
- What's Jack up to?
- Probably his shrimp appetizer.

365
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:11,971
- He took Kate to lunch.
- Winning the war of hearts and minds.

366
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:14,488
<i>It's hard to convince people</i>
<i>they're in danger.</i>

367
00:22:14,653 --> 00:22:17,087
It's that much harder
with Jack working against you.

368
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:20,609
Okay, well, if you can't stop Kate
from answering the distress call...

369
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:23,446
...then maybe you can stop
the distress call itself.

370
00:22:23,653 --> 00:22:26,406
Right. There's no danger
if there's no one to save.

371
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:34,010
Some college kids lost control
of a boat called the <i>Green Hornet</i>.

372
00:22:36,493 --> 00:22:39,007
Thanks, I'm on it.
Just one thing I need you to do.

373
00:22:39,173 --> 00:22:41,892
- Yeah? What's that?
- Find a way to ground Kate's boat.

374
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:43,805
You mean ground the police boat?

375
00:22:44,013 --> 00:22:47,005
Yeah, we have to cover our bases
and stay one step ahead of Jack.

376
00:22:47,173 --> 00:22:50,882
Well, you're one step ahead of me.
You can't ground a police boat, Tru.

377
00:22:51,093 --> 00:22:55,450
You'll think of something,
I know you will. All right? Okay, bye.

378
00:22:56,613 --> 00:22:59,047
People think I'm crazy
around here. Jeez.

379
00:23:07,693 --> 00:23:11,322
She's a beauty. Fiberglass hull,
Evinrude engine.

380
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:15,372
Yeah, it's my father's.
Thinks of it as the son he never had.

381
00:23:16,493 --> 00:23:19,690
- So can I help you with something?
- Actually, I think I can help you.

382
00:23:19,893 --> 00:23:23,522
I'm a volunteer with the Harbor Patrol.
There's a storm advisory for the bay...

383
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,048
...so we're grounding
all recreational crafts.

384
00:23:26,653 --> 00:23:28,644
- You're kidding me.
- I wish I was.

385
00:23:28,813 --> 00:23:30,963
Hasn't exactly made me
Miss Popularity today.

386
00:23:31,173 --> 00:23:34,290
No, I mean...
Man, I thought he was nuts.

387
00:23:34,493 --> 00:23:37,212
- What's that?
- I'm guessing you're Tru, right?

388
00:23:37,813 --> 00:23:39,087
Yeah.

389
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:42,404
Some guy paid me a visit this morning,
said you might stop by today.

390
00:23:42,573 --> 00:23:47,203
- And he told me to give you this.
- A guy?

391
00:23:47,373 --> 00:23:48,806
Said you'd try to ruin my trip.

392
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:53,325
Something about a storm.
I thought he was crazy.

393
00:23:53,693 --> 00:23:57,003
No, you have to trust me.
It's not safe out there today.

394
00:23:57,213 --> 00:24:01,650
With people like you around, the bay
sounds like the safest place I could be.

396
00:24:18,013 --> 00:24:19,571
Hey, this is Harrison.

397
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:25,888
Stolen? What? You're kidding.

398
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:31,450
Ground a police boat.
Ground a police boat.

399
00:24:31,893 --> 00:24:33,849
Okay.

401
00:24:37,413 --> 00:24:39,927
Hi, this is Admiral McNulty
of the Fifth Fleet.

402
00:24:40,093 --> 00:24:42,971
I was pulling in port today.
I couldn't help but notice...

403
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:45,567
...a vessel, starboard side,
that was...

404
00:24:47,493 --> 00:24:50,451
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Dr. Allen.

405
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:54,322
- Tom Jordan's replacement.
- Oh, God. My psych evaluation.

406
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,166
Can you hold on a second?

407
00:24:57,653 --> 00:25:01,168
Yeah, you're about a half an hour late,
so I decided to come down...

408
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:04,683
...and see what was keeping you.
And now I know.

409
00:25:04,853 --> 00:25:07,128
You were making phony phone calls.

410
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:10,370
- It's not... It's not what you think it is.
- Really?

411
00:25:10,573 --> 00:25:13,406
Why don't go ahead and explain it
to me then, admiral.

412
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,730
It's a funny story, actually. The...

413
00:25:19,733 --> 00:25:24,124
- Okay, maybe it's not that funny. It's...
- The good news, doctor?

414
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:27,570
I don't think you'll be needing
that psych evaluation after all...

415
00:25:27,733 --> 00:25:31,089
...because I'm thinking that I have
all the answers that I need.

416
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:34,883
Hello? Yeah, I'm still here.

417
00:25:37,533 --> 00:25:41,048
- Thanks again for lunch.
- Thanks again for saving my life.

418
00:25:41,213 --> 00:25:43,522
Hey, I know this might sound
a little forward...

419
00:25:43,693 --> 00:25:47,811
...but there's a street festival downtown
that's supposed to be a ton of fun.

420
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:52,372
I know that look. You're flattered,
but you have a girl...

421
00:25:52,533 --> 00:25:54,603
...who wouldn't appreciate me
asking you out.

422
00:25:54,773 --> 00:25:56,809
You're right, I do have a girl.

423
00:25:56,973 --> 00:26:00,807
My sister's sailing into town tonight,
and we have a lot of catching up to do.

424
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:03,282
Sure. Right. Anyway,
it's none of my business, so...

425
00:26:03,453 --> 00:26:04,727
But...

426
00:26:04,893 --> 00:26:07,248
...I am free all day tomorrow.

427
00:26:08,173 --> 00:26:09,162
Great.

428
00:26:10,573 --> 00:26:12,131
Me too.

429
00:26:12,293 --> 00:26:14,443
Kate! Come on, let's go.

430
00:26:14,613 --> 00:26:17,764
But you should probably leave.
If they see me loafing anymore...

431
00:26:17,933 --> 00:26:20,686
...they'll dry-dock me.
I won't be able to make any rescues.

432
00:26:20,853 --> 00:26:24,050
- Right. Well, we wouldn't want that.
- See you tomorrow.

433
00:26:24,213 --> 00:26:26,283
Tomorrow. Right.

434
00:26:39,613 --> 00:26:41,922
- Kate, hi.
- Tru, we are way past amusing here.

435
00:26:42,093 --> 00:26:45,005
You have to listen to me.
It's not safe for you out there today.

436
00:26:45,173 --> 00:26:48,085
Maybe this job isn't for you,
but it's what I do. I save people.

437
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:50,209
- Like Jack Harper?
- Yeah, exactly.

438
00:26:50,373 --> 00:26:52,125
Things aren't always as they seem.

439
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:55,683
- Are you saying I didn't save Jack?
- I'm saying things can be deceiving.

440
00:26:55,853 --> 00:26:59,004
Like right now, the water's calm,
but that can change so quickly.

441
00:26:59,173 --> 00:27:02,210
- So?
- A storm can come on without warning.

442
00:27:02,373 --> 00:27:04,967
- A white squall or...
- A white squall?

443
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:07,806
Tru, you've been watching
too many movies.

444
00:27:08,013 --> 00:27:12,484
The weather's beautiful. We haven't had
a distress call since this morning.

445
00:27:13,013 --> 00:27:15,243
Responded to an SOS call at 3:07 p.m.

447
00:27:16,693 --> 00:27:19,491
<i>Mayday!</i>
<i>This is the</i> Green Hornet<i>. Our location:</i>

448
00:27:19,653 --> 00:27:23,441
<i>We're just past the drilling platform.</i>
<i>We're taking on water. We're in trouble.</i>

449
00:27:24,013 --> 00:27:27,130
- This is Harbor Patrol. We're on our way.
- Kate. Kate, wait.

450
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,210
Nothing's gonna happen to me.
Today's no different.

451
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:32,803
- But it is. Let me come with you.
- Should I answer, or is laughter enough?

452
00:27:32,973 --> 00:27:34,247
Come on, let's go.

453
00:27:34,413 --> 00:27:38,008
I know what it's like to wanna save
people, but we can't save everyone.

454
00:27:38,213 --> 00:27:40,283
Well, maybe you can't, but I can.

456
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,051
<i>Green Hornet</i>, this is Harbor Patrol.
Restate your position.

457
00:28:01,253 --> 00:28:04,609
<i>We're just past the drilling</i>
<i>platform. Please hurry, the engine's dead.</i>

458
00:28:04,773 --> 00:28:06,126
<i>Green Hornet</i>, can you hear me?

460
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:08,442
<i>Green Hornet</i>? Damn it!

461
00:28:10,293 --> 00:28:11,567
Oh, my God.

462
00:28:12,853 --> 00:28:15,083
- What the hell is that?
- She was right.

464
00:28:18,653 --> 00:28:20,450
We can't go into that.

465
00:28:23,373 --> 00:28:25,011
We won't come out.

466
00:28:25,893 --> 00:28:27,485
We have to. They need us.

467
00:28:29,933 --> 00:28:31,127
We have to.

468
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:32,806
<i>This is the Coast Guard.</i>

469
00:28:33,013 --> 00:28:35,891
<i>Spotted the vessel. Got a tow line.</i>
<i>Bringing her in. Over.</i>

470
00:28:36,053 --> 00:28:39,284
Coast Guard, this is Harbor Patrol.
Do you need assistance? Over.

471
00:28:39,453 --> 00:28:42,570
<i>Under control. Got a tip</i>
<i>from Admiral McNulty, Fifth Fleet.</i>

472
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:46,203
- <i>Didn 't know there was a Fifth Fleet.</i>
- Let's get the hell out of here.

473
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:07,728
- You're okay.
- Coast Guard took the call.

474
00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:09,770
Someone called in a tip.

475
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,130
Good one, Davis.

476
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:15,725
You know, I'm not quite sure
what you're all about...

477
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:18,528
...but I trust you're gonna
leave me alone now?

478
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:20,612
Gladly.

479
00:29:22,693 --> 00:29:25,685
Who says I can't save everyone?

480
00:29:26,573 --> 00:29:28,882
- <i>Hello</i>?
- Nice call on the Coast Guard.

481
00:29:29,093 --> 00:29:33,405
- I didn't think they had jurisdiction.
- They don't. I was very convincing.

482
00:29:33,573 --> 00:29:36,724
- What time do you have?
- Four-fifteen. Tru?

483
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:39,288
- What?
- Kate is safe. You averted her death.

484
00:29:39,453 --> 00:29:43,969
- You did all you were supposed to do.
- The rules have changed. Jack is back.

485
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:47,523
Until I have him in my sights,
I can't trust that I've won.

486
00:29:47,693 --> 00:29:49,490
He has to be here.

487
00:29:49,653 --> 00:29:52,486
Jack saved this little girl yesterday
at exactly 4: 16.

488
00:29:52,693 --> 00:29:56,129
If his job really is to preserve fate,
then he has to save her again today.

489
00:29:56,293 --> 00:30:00,252
That's right. In Jack's view, letting
someone die who's meant to live...

490
00:30:00,413 --> 00:30:03,610
...is just as bad as letting someone live
who was meant to die.

491
00:30:03,813 --> 00:30:07,169
Well, let's hope he's as good at his job
as he thinks he is.

492
00:30:08,293 --> 00:30:10,204
Okay, Davis, it's showtime.

493
00:30:24,453 --> 00:30:25,852
Hey.

494
00:30:26,893 --> 00:30:28,485
Your skateboard, you don't have it.

495
00:30:28,653 --> 00:30:31,213
Some guy just bought it from me
for $50.

496
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:35,932
Jack.

497
00:30:40,653 --> 00:30:42,848
Sorry for being so pushy...

498
00:30:44,213 --> 00:30:45,692
...but just couldn't stay away.

499
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,408
It's really starting
to come down out there.

500
00:30:57,573 --> 00:30:59,291
I thought you had plans tonight.

501
00:30:59,453 --> 00:31:02,923
I did, but my sister called.
She's running late...

502
00:31:03,093 --> 00:31:04,412
...so looks like I'm free.

503
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:08,532
That's funny, so am I. I asked some guy
out this afternoon, but he said no.

504
00:31:08,693 --> 00:31:11,844
Now, what kind of fool would do that?

505
00:31:12,293 --> 00:31:14,682
Okay, listen, I get off shift
in about 10 minutes.

506
00:31:14,893 --> 00:31:16,531
- So you think you can wait?
- You bet.

507
00:31:16,693 --> 00:31:17,682
Okay.

508
00:31:17,853 --> 00:31:20,526
<i>Mayday.</i>
<i>This is a fishing vessel.</i> Cloud One.

509
00:31:20,693 --> 00:31:22,012
Excuse me.

510
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:25,802
Harbor Patrol. Please state the position
and nature of your emergency. Over.

511
00:31:26,013 --> 00:31:28,527
<i>There's a boat.</i>
<i>It's out in the storm. It's flipping.</i>

512
00:31:28,693 --> 00:31:30,649
Please state your position. Over.

513
00:31:30,813 --> 00:31:32,769
<i>Just past the buoy</i>
<i>at the mouth of the bay.</i>

514
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,242
- And the boat, can you identify it?
- <i>No, wait.</i>

515
00:31:35,413 --> 00:31:37,449
<i>It's the</i> Jezebel.
<i>That's what it's called.</i>

516
00:31:37,613 --> 00:31:40,685
The <i>Jezebel</i>? No, that's the ship
my sister's sailing in on tonight.

517
00:31:40,893 --> 00:31:43,088
They were running late,
but everything was fine.

518
00:31:43,293 --> 00:31:46,763
<i>Harbor Patrol, there's a girl.</i>
<i>She's overboard. She's in the water.</i>

519
00:31:47,453 --> 00:31:49,523
Harbor Patrol's responding.

520
00:31:49,853 --> 00:31:52,367
- Kate.
- It's my job, Jack.

522
00:32:00,613 --> 00:32:01,887
Harbor Patrol.

523
00:32:02,093 --> 00:32:04,084
How did I know
you were gonna answer?

524
00:32:04,293 --> 00:32:06,761
- How did I know you'd be calling?
- What did you say?

525
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:08,651
What did you say
to get her back out there?

526
00:32:08,813 --> 00:32:12,044
- She's saving my sister, Tru.
- Your sister's dead.

527
00:32:12,253 --> 00:32:13,242
Oops.

528
00:32:13,413 --> 00:32:16,849
Kate Wilson was fated to die
this afternoon, Jack, and I saved her.

529
00:32:17,253 --> 00:32:19,369
Yes. Yes, you did.

530
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:20,886
But the day's not over yet...

531
00:32:21,093 --> 00:32:23,846
...and therefore, my window
of opportunity is still open.

532
00:32:24,013 --> 00:32:25,844
And luckily for me...

533
00:32:28,293 --> 00:32:32,844
...this storm just keeps getting worse.
- <i>Kate helps people. She saves lives.</i>

534
00:32:33,253 --> 00:32:37,451
Good people have to die too, Tru.
You know that as well as I.

535
00:32:37,613 --> 00:32:40,810
You say you're not a killer, but what
the hell do you call what you're doing?

536
00:32:41,013 --> 00:32:42,332
My job.

537
00:32:43,813 --> 00:32:45,371
Later, Tru.

539
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,004
Really not a good time, Harry.

540
00:32:52,213 --> 00:32:54,443
But you will not believe what happened.

541
00:32:54,613 --> 00:32:58,572
- They stole the van again?
- No, not that. That's not the problem.

542
00:32:58,773 --> 00:33:02,482
See, apparently, the Gerber brothers,
they run some sort of scam.

543
00:33:02,653 --> 00:33:05,884
Yeah, they boost their own van,
and they collect the insurance money.

544
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:09,170
Yeah. I parked in a secured lot,
and almost screwed up the whole thing.

545
00:33:09,373 --> 00:33:12,046
<i>Here I thought I was, like,</i>
<i>living this clean life.</i>

546
00:33:12,253 --> 00:33:15,165
But no. No, I've been working for crooks
the entire time.

547
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:17,927
- I'm sorry, Harry, but I'll call you later.
- <i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

548
00:33:27,253 --> 00:33:29,369
Don't worry. She's gonna be fine.

549
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:31,489
This is what I do.

550
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:41,051
I'm sorry, that... I've just been
wanting to do that all day.

551
00:33:42,213 --> 00:33:44,568
- Kate?
- Yeah?

552
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:48,966
We'll have dinner another time.

554
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:05,211
- Yeah?
- <i>Everything back on track?</i>

555
00:34:05,373 --> 00:34:09,605
I almost thought you really saw her boat
out there, Richard. I'm impressed.

556
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:14,011
I'm glad to be of help, Jack,
but next time, do it yourself.

557
00:35:09,493 --> 00:35:12,963
Pan-Pan. Pan-Pan.
This is Harbor Patrol.

558
00:35:13,173 --> 00:35:16,324
Pan-Pan. This is Harbor Patrol. Damn.

559
00:35:58,653 --> 00:36:00,405
No!

560
00:36:01,653 --> 00:36:02,642
No!

561
00:36:46,933 --> 00:36:48,446
Kate.

562
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:04,167
Kate. Hang on, I'm coming.

563
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:06,850
Hang on, Kate.

564
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,251
Got you.

565
00:37:11,013 --> 00:37:13,447
Just hold on, Kate, I've got you.

566
00:37:16,053 --> 00:37:17,805
Come on.

567
00:37:18,813 --> 00:37:21,008
Come on, Kate, it's okay.

568
00:37:25,613 --> 00:37:27,524
Okay. You're gonna be okay.

570
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:30,202
Thank you.

571
00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:33,524
Here. You're all right.

572
00:37:43,213 --> 00:37:44,202
Doctor.

573
00:37:44,373 --> 00:37:47,046
Hi. I was just getting ready
to go upstairs to apologize.

574
00:37:47,213 --> 00:37:49,966
I'm sorry about
what happened in there.

575
00:37:50,133 --> 00:37:52,886
Really? I was just on my way down
to tell you not to bother.

576
00:37:53,613 --> 00:37:55,843
I spent the evening
going through your file, doctor.

577
00:37:56,013 --> 00:37:59,369
- Oh, boy, my file.
- And you know what I found?

578
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:02,445
Glowing personnel reviews,
meritorious raises...

579
00:38:02,653 --> 00:38:06,532
...and commendations from everybody,
from the mayor to the chief of police.

580
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:11,288
- My file?
- So, what I'm saying is, doctor...

581
00:38:11,453 --> 00:38:16,129
...if you feel the need to do crazy things
now and again to blow off steam...

582
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:18,727
...well, maybe somebody has to be
a little crazy...

583
00:38:18,893 --> 00:38:21,043
...to work here in the first place.

584
00:38:22,173 --> 00:38:24,562
I'm saying I think
the evaluation can wait.

585
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:26,765
Yeah. Yeah.

586
00:38:26,933 --> 00:38:30,972
And I don't think that we've been
properly introduced.

587
00:38:31,693 --> 00:38:32,967
Hi.

588
00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:36,089
- I'm Dr. Carrie Allen.
- I'm Davis.

589
00:38:37,213 --> 00:38:39,852
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

590
00:38:43,053 --> 00:38:46,602
I am so glad you changed your mind.
It's gonna be great working together.

591
00:38:46,773 --> 00:38:49,571
Yes. It will be great
to make an honest living.

592
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:57,527
Listen, maybe this job is gonna give us,
I don't know...

593
00:38:57,693 --> 00:39:01,652
...a chance to make up for lost time,
for my mistakes.

594
00:39:01,853 --> 00:39:04,128
There is still a lot we can learn
from each other.

595
00:39:04,293 --> 00:39:06,648
- Yeah.
- About each other.

597
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:13,612
- What?
- Wouldn't it be ironic if you and I...

598
00:39:13,773 --> 00:39:15,843
...were a lot more alike
than people thought?

599
00:39:22,973 --> 00:39:26,170
- Refill?
- No. I'm gonna get out of here.

600
00:39:26,613 --> 00:39:29,650
I wanna be fresh,
impress that new boss.

601
00:39:33,533 --> 00:39:35,125
Yeah.

602
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:38,562
See you tomorrow.

603
00:39:48,613 --> 00:39:51,764
- You got sloppy today.
- Thanks, coach.

604
00:39:52,413 --> 00:39:54,563
Don't take it so hard.
I told you she was good.

605
00:39:54,773 --> 00:39:57,048
Well, at least one of us won today.

606
00:39:57,213 --> 00:39:59,363
- Harrison?
- Signed and sealed. Starts tomorrow.

607
00:40:00,853 --> 00:40:03,413
- Gonna tell him?
- In time.

608
00:40:03,773 --> 00:40:06,526
I just told him I'm proud of him.
One bombshell at a time.

609
00:40:08,013 --> 00:40:11,005
He's a good kid. He'll be an asset.

610
00:40:11,173 --> 00:40:14,370
But he does love his sister,
and that bond is stronger than you think.

611
00:40:15,133 --> 00:40:17,249
So's the bond between father and son.

612
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:20,204
Night, Jack. Get some rest.

613
00:40:21,373 --> 00:40:23,682
Apparently, you'll be needing it.

614
00:40:34,093 --> 00:40:36,288
I thought I heard you come in.

615
00:40:39,653 --> 00:40:43,931
I beat him, Davis. I beat Jack.

616
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:49,412
Saved Kate, gave fate what it wanted.
So why doesn't it feel like enough?

617
00:40:50,053 --> 00:40:51,486
Because it wasn't Luc.

618
00:40:54,693 --> 00:40:59,005
Is that how it goes? I save strangers,
but I lose the people I love?

619
00:40:59,893 --> 00:41:02,282
- Tru...
- Sorry. I'm fine, really.

620
00:41:02,933 --> 00:41:05,766
- It was a momentary lapse of...
- Humanity.

621
00:41:09,973 --> 00:41:14,091
Anyway, it's late. I better go.
Good night, Davis.

622
00:41:14,253 --> 00:41:16,767
Night. Oh, by the way...

623
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:19,322
...what did Jack say
when he realized you beat him?

624
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:23,321
Don't know.
But I wish I could've been there.
