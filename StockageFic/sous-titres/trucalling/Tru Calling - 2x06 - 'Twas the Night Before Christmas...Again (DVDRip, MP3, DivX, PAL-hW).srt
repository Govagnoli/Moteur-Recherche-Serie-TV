1
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:33,049
As long as she doesn't
find out about us.

3
00:00:33,213 --> 00:00:37,923
I have other responsibilities, a wife, my
job. I shouldn't have to worry about you...

4
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:40,765
I gotta go. I'll talk to you later.

5
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:42,571
Can I help you?

6
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:45,452
Hey, Dad. I didn't wanna interrupt
your phone conversation.

7
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:48,207
No, it's just somebody about a case
I've been working on.

8
00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:50,409
- What can I do for you?
- I've been thinking.

9
00:00:50,573 --> 00:00:55,886
I've been putting in some long hours and
some extra work, and I was wondering...

10
00:00:56,053 --> 00:01:00,683
...if I could have a raise. Also, they
raised my rent, and I've been kind of...

11
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:03,083
I've grown fond of living indoors.

12
00:01:03,253 --> 00:01:05,369
I wish I could help you, Harrison...

13
00:01:06,213 --> 00:01:08,647
...but such a quick pay bump,
and for my son.

14
00:01:08,813 --> 00:01:12,010
- You understand how that would look.
- Yeah, I figured.

15
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:14,323
You can't blame a guy for trying, huh?

16
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:17,932
Right.

17
00:01:18,893 --> 00:01:20,849
Okay, so you get eight days
of Christmas?

18
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:23,811
Tyler, for the last time,
it's called Hanukkah, all right?

19
00:01:23,973 --> 00:01:27,568
If you call it Christmas one more time,
I'm gonna shove a menorah up your...

20
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:30,691
Secret Santas. We should
open up our nondenominational gifts.

21
00:01:30,853 --> 00:01:32,809
Great idea. Um...

22
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:35,771
- Ave, you go first.
- Yes.

23
00:01:36,773 --> 00:01:39,082
- Drum roll.
- I got...

24
00:01:40,693 --> 00:01:42,365
...a comb.

25
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:45,764
And I'm gonna guess
that it's from Tyler.

26
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:47,651
Hey. What happened to the secret part?

27
00:01:47,813 --> 00:01:50,281
FYI, buddy,
the "under 10 dollar" rule...

28
00:01:50,453 --> 00:01:53,843
...that's actually not a contest to see
how far under 10 you can keep it.

29
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,163
I know these two are
going home for vacation.

30
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,847
If they survive the ride
to the airport together.

31
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:01,322
But what about you?
What are the Davies up to tonight?

32
00:02:01,493 --> 00:02:06,362
Well, it looks like, as usual, my family
Christmas Eve will consist of me...

33
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:10,845
...my brother, Harry, and a toast to the
rest of the family who couldn't make it.

34
00:02:11,013 --> 00:02:12,844
Well, on the bright side,
there's less cleanup.

35
00:02:13,053 --> 00:02:14,691
- But more therapy.
- You know what?

36
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:17,572
Coal for you in your stocking.
That's all you'll get.

37
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:20,884
My people, we don't do the stockings.
None of that.

38
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:24,887
What is going on with you? Normally
you're all "bah humbug" and grinch-y.

39
00:02:25,053 --> 00:02:28,841
This year, I'm all about the holiday spirit,
the tree trimming, the church.

40
00:02:29,013 --> 00:02:31,573
- Hell, I might even sit on Santa's lap.
- Lucky Santa.

41
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:34,645
Lucky me. You know,
I mean, I shouldn't even be here.

42
00:02:34,813 --> 00:02:36,804
But you saved me.

43
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:40,852
And I know it sounds dumb,
but every day is a gift.

44
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,444
Even a day like Christmas.

45
00:02:49,853 --> 00:02:51,445
Dad's doing it again.

46
00:02:51,613 --> 00:02:53,251
- It?
- It. It.

47
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:56,086
- He's having an affair.
- What? Why?

48
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:58,721
I don't know. I guess he's not
getting everything...

49
00:02:58,893 --> 00:03:00,929
...out of his relationship with Jordan.
- Ew. No.

50
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:03,049
I mean, what makes you think
he's messing around?

51
00:03:03,213 --> 00:03:05,488
Oh. Well, there's the
secret phone calls.

52
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:08,725
There's the long lunches
that are not on the calendar.

53
00:03:09,213 --> 00:03:12,250
- And then there's the apartment.
- What apartment?

54
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:17,372
Okay, ever since Dad started acting
all suspicious, I started following him.

55
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:19,524
- Harry.
- What?

56
00:03:19,693 --> 00:03:23,083
Three times a week he goes to this
place. He spends, like, half an hour...

57
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:26,051
...45 minutes, then he leaves.

58
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:28,852
Look, I know Dad's got
a less than stellar track record...

59
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:32,722
...in the fidelity department, but I don't
think we should jump to conclusions...

60
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:34,406
...until we have proof.
- I know.

61
00:03:34,573 --> 00:03:36,211
I know. You're right.

62
00:03:36,493 --> 00:03:38,563
I know what I'm bringing
for Christmas dinner.

63
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:40,689
- What's that?
- Proof.

64
00:03:47,613 --> 00:03:50,764
You've gotta be kidding me.
Someone killed Santa?

65
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:54,608
I know. It's pretty creepy, huh?

66
00:03:54,773 --> 00:03:56,843
But I think he died of natural causes.

67
00:03:57,013 --> 00:03:59,811
He must be one of those gentlemen
from the mall or something.

68
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,965
I came by to grab something,
but do you need me to bag personals?

69
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:05,567
No. All he has
is a black bag of presents...

70
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:07,405
...that's already been processed.

71
00:04:07,573 --> 00:04:10,849
We're lucky. The holidays is one
of the most violent times of the year.

72
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:14,767
- But he's our only fatality brought in.
- Lf he's the only dead guy in town...

73
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:18,005
...what are the odds Saint Nick's
gonna open his eyes and whisper:

74
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:19,811
"Ho, ho, help me."

76
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,242
- City Morgue.
- Hey, Davis, it's me.

77
00:04:28,413 --> 00:04:31,325
I'm sorry, I'm gonna be
a little late for our dinner tonight.

78
00:04:31,493 --> 00:04:33,927
- Is everything okay?
<i>- Yeah, I'm at the youth center...</i>

79
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:36,687
...for our department's
community relations program.

80
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:38,650
There you go.

81
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:42,842
And we hired a Santa to bring some
presents to the underprivileged kids...

82
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:45,447
...and the guy hasn't shown up yet.

83
00:04:45,613 --> 00:04:47,683
<i>And the kids</i>
<i>are gonna be so disappointed.</i>

84
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:51,050
He's just gonna be another person
in their lives who's let them down.

85
00:04:51,213 --> 00:04:52,202
Yes.

86
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:58,085
Carrie, I think I might know
what happened to him.

87
00:04:58,253 --> 00:04:59,732
Really? What?

88
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:05,526
- He's probably stuck in holiday traffic.
<i>- Yeah, you're probably right.</i>

89
00:05:05,693 --> 00:05:09,686
- Anyway, I'll get there as soon as I can.
- I'll see you later.

90
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,969
Well, hey, if it makes you feel
any better...

91
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:15,249
...you're welcome
to join me and Harry tonight.

92
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:19,804
No, that's okay. It's been a while
since I've spent the holidays with a...

93
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:23,363
With a woman, so I think I'll just...
I'll wait for her.

94
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:26,206
- All right. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

95
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:28,648
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

96
00:06:18,293 --> 00:06:21,012
I wish I could make her understand,
but that's not possible.

97
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,812
If she finds out,
there's no telling what it'll do to her.

98
00:06:23,973 --> 00:06:26,533
The most important thing
right now is that she trust me.

99
00:06:26,693 --> 00:06:28,570
Hi, Dad.

100
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:54,052
Help me.

101
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:14,205
Harrison, you're late again.

102
00:07:14,373 --> 00:07:17,763
And frankly, I'm running out
of expletives, so here's the deal.

103
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:20,766
I have the night off,
and I'm not spending it waiting for you.

104
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:22,969
So as un-festive as it sounds...

105
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:25,806
...you can find me at the lab,
catching up on work.

106
00:07:25,973 --> 00:07:29,329
I'll be the one cutting out a spleen
and pretending it's yours.

107
00:07:29,493 --> 00:07:32,087
Next time I talk to you,
you better have a good reason...

108
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:34,084
...for standing me up
on Christmas Eve.

109
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:38,330
Harrison, will you let me explain?

110
00:07:38,493 --> 00:07:41,690
Jack. You work with Jack Harper.
I thought you were having an affair.

111
00:07:41,853 --> 00:07:43,889
- What are you talking about?
- Those calls.

112
00:07:44,053 --> 00:07:46,772
Those calls weren't about your wife,
they were about Tru!

113
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:50,084
Look, I heard Tru mention that this guy
Jack was harassing her.

114
00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:51,971
So I'm trying to protect my daughter.

115
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:55,205
- Since when is that a crime?
- How about when it's a damn lie.

116
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:58,487
All right, you want the truth?

117
00:07:58,653 --> 00:08:00,644
Well, it'd be a nice change of pace.

118
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:05,808
Jack Harper contacted me with some
very strange stories about your sister.

119
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:08,009
He told me she had this...

120
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:10,642
...gift. Then he told me
to meet him here today...

121
00:08:10,813 --> 00:08:12,690
...and that's what I was doing.

122
00:08:12,853 --> 00:08:15,606
- So that was the first time you met him?
- Yes.

123
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:20,644
I've seen you go to that apartment
three times this week.

124
00:08:21,573 --> 00:08:22,926
Dad...

125
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:25,091
I always knew you were smart, son.

126
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:28,882
Tru was better with the books,
but you, you know people.

127
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:39,923
You have no idea
what you are dealing with.

128
00:08:40,493 --> 00:08:42,131
Then tell me,
what am I dealing with?

129
00:08:42,293 --> 00:08:44,329
Look, I wanna
be honest with you, son.

130
00:08:44,493 --> 00:08:46,529
And I want you to understand...

131
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,649
...what is at stake here.

132
00:08:48,813 --> 00:08:51,771
- But you gotta promise me one thing.
- What? What is that?

133
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:54,970
You will not mention to Tru
what I am about to discuss with you.

134
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:57,363
It'll be a cold day in hell
before I promise you.

135
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:59,285
I am so sorry to hear that.

136
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:12,485
Dad.

138
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:18,491
Harrison, I'm so sorry.

139
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:45,729
- Whoa. You scared me.
- A room full of corpses, and I scared you.

140
00:09:45,893 --> 00:09:49,329
Sorry. What are you doing here?
I thought you were out decking the halls.

141
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:51,165
I was, and then it dawned on me.

142
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,962
Nobody should be alone on
Christmas Eve, not even our friend here.

143
00:09:56,173 --> 00:09:59,404
You know, we haven't
had a chance to talk...

144
00:09:59,973 --> 00:10:02,646
...about how you're feeling.
- About?

145
00:10:03,933 --> 00:10:06,686
I just mean, sometimes
a near-death experience...

146
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:08,809
...can have a strange effect
on people.

147
00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:11,773
Honestly, I feel great.

148
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:16,092
I feel better than great. It's like this
huge wake-up call for me, you know?

149
00:10:16,253 --> 00:10:18,448
A chance to reevaluate my priorities.

150
00:10:18,653 --> 00:10:20,484
- In what way?
- Having them, for instance.

151
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,167
I'm not gonna have priorities.
I'm gonna do everything.

152
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,483
You know? Do whatever I want,
devil-may-care.

153
00:10:25,853 --> 00:10:28,003
I like this new Jensen,
but I gotta tell you...

154
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:31,688
...I never really saw you
as the devil-may-care kind of guy.

155
00:10:31,853 --> 00:10:34,048
Well, maybe not everybody's
as they seem.

156
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:48,969
Come on, Tru. Come on, Tru,
answer the phone please. Come on.

157
00:10:49,173 --> 00:10:52,051
Got a text from Avery and Tyler.
Their flights are cancelled.

158
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:54,363
They're spending
Christmas Eve at the airport.

159
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:57,127
Oh. That's probably my brother
with some lame excuse...

160
00:10:57,293 --> 00:10:59,284
...on why he bailed on me.

161
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:04,811
<i>Help me.</i>

162
00:11:14,453 --> 00:11:17,411
'Twas the night
before Christmas, again.

163
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:21,005
- Avery, it's Tru.
- <i>Hola, chica.</i> What's up?

164
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:22,572
I'm not gonna go to breakfast.

165
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:24,849
- Work emergency.
- Work emergency. Right.

166
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:28,722
You're gonna either need to get
a better job or a better excuse.

167
00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:30,611
Right. But, hey, I was just thinking.

168
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,446
You and Tyler should call
the airline before you go...

169
00:11:33,613 --> 00:11:35,205
<i>... in case they cancel your flight.</i>

170
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:37,762
No one wants to spend Christmas Eve
in an airport.

171
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:40,731
Yes, thank you.
Happy Holidays, Tru.

172
00:11:40,893 --> 00:11:42,246
You too.

174
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:53,322
You woke me up yesterday too.

175
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:55,612
- Rough night?
<i>- No.</i>

176
00:11:55,773 --> 00:11:58,048
Unless we're careful,
it's gonna be a rough day.

177
00:11:58,213 --> 00:12:01,808
<i>- Harrison followed you to my apartment.</i>
- Thank God it's a new day.

178
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:05,090
The point is, just be careful around
your son today. Be nice to him.

179
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:08,450
Find out what he knows.
You know how this works, Richard.

180
00:12:08,613 --> 00:12:10,729
We're not gonna get another chance.

182
00:12:16,813 --> 00:12:18,963
- Hey, boss.
- Harrison.

183
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:20,646
What can I do for my boy?

185
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,609
Well, I've been thinking.

186
00:12:24,773 --> 00:12:30,211
I've put in a lot of work, some
extra hours around the office and...

187
00:12:31,373 --> 00:12:33,967
...I was wondering if I can get a raise.
- A raise?

188
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:36,249
- I really think...
- Well...

189
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:38,571
...you certainly deserve it.

190
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:41,372
Let me take it to the partners
and see what they say.

191
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:44,252
Hey. Wow.

192
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:53,525
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

193
00:12:53,693 --> 00:12:56,890
- Who killed Santa Claus?
- Natural causes.

194
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,922
Knowing you, he's gonna
open his eyes and ask for...

195
00:13:02,093 --> 00:13:03,572
I told that joke yesterday.

196
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:06,452
He was supposed to deliver toys
to kids at the youth center.

197
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:08,285
- That's where Carrie is.
- I know.

198
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:11,365
She's gonna miss dinner trying
to keep from disappointing them.

199
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:14,605
- Lf he didn't ask for help, then who did?
- A cadaver.

200
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:17,241
- Which drawer?
- Not here. At school.

201
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:20,291
- Those bodies have been dead for...
- Six months. I know.

202
00:13:20,453 --> 00:13:22,569
That's why I came here
to talk to you first.

203
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,644
I mean, I didn't rewind
to six months ago.

204
00:13:24,813 --> 00:13:27,281
So why would a body
that's still dead ask for my help?

205
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:30,047
- One advantage to your predicament.
- What's that?

206
00:13:30,213 --> 00:13:31,965
Well, the clues are always
on the body.

207
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:34,852
And for the first time,
you have a body to work with.

208
00:13:37,893 --> 00:13:40,043
For the record, she was dead
when I got here.

209
00:13:40,213 --> 00:13:43,523
- Duly noted. Now, get out.
- Already on my way.

210
00:13:43,693 --> 00:13:46,332
Looks like I got the day off.
Because you're good, Davies.

211
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,610
But you're not that good.
Stale corpse, no clues.

212
00:13:49,773 --> 00:13:53,652
Hey, what if I was to offer to help you
with your job today?

213
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:56,247
What if I was to offer
to help you kiss my ass?

214
00:13:56,413 --> 00:14:00,247
That's funny. No, but really,
think of it as a holiday truce.

215
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:03,325
What harm could I do? There was
only one fatality yesterday...

216
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:06,007
...and that one already
"ho, ho" happened, am I right?

217
00:14:06,493 --> 00:14:09,371
Come on, there's no one to save.
There's no one to fight over.

218
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:11,046
I might even be helpful.

219
00:14:11,213 --> 00:14:14,125
Jack, there is no way
I would ever accept your help.

220
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:17,888
You try and be a nice guy...

221
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:22,969
Merry Christmas to all,
and to all good luck.

222
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,764
So you asked for my help.

223
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:38,128
Who are you,
and what do you want from me?

224
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:40,090
So you talk to them too?

225
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:42,687
You have this way
of catching me off guard.

226
00:14:42,853 --> 00:14:45,413
Wow, so you blew off breakfast
for schoolwork.

227
00:14:45,573 --> 00:14:48,371
When you said work emergency,
I just assumed that you meant...

228
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:51,366
I just feel I've been getting behind,
with all the classes I've missed.

229
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:53,683
Right, right, right.

230
00:14:53,853 --> 00:14:59,291
Then why is it that you're working on
another group's cadaver instead of ours?

231
00:14:59,453 --> 00:15:02,286
- Checking up on their work.
- I do the same thing.

232
00:15:02,453 --> 00:15:04,648
You picked a good one too.

233
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:06,927
You feel that?

234
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:09,967
- It's like her skull is cracked.
- Exactly.

235
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:13,443
And you see the small pinpoint blotches
around her eyes?

236
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:16,411
- Petechial hemorrhage.
- And you said you were falling behind.

237
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:19,690
- So this woman died from asphyxiation.
- She was murdered by it.

238
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:22,447
Probably fell postmortem,
led to the cranium fracture.

239
00:15:23,413 --> 00:15:26,849
A lecture the professor gave
one of the days you were gone.

240
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:30,289
He said it was pretty rare to find
a body that met an unnatural demise.

241
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:31,852
Well, not in my line of work.

242
00:15:32,653 --> 00:15:36,965
Anyway, I've got some last-minute
shopping to do, but thanks for your help.

243
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:38,452
Any time.

244
00:15:38,613 --> 00:15:40,285
Later.

245
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:49,609
Let me guess,
you think Dad's having an affair.

246
00:15:49,773 --> 00:15:53,243
- I still hate it when you do that.
- Well, I hate it when you stand me up.

247
00:15:53,413 --> 00:15:55,324
You didn't show last night.
What happened?

248
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:58,883
Well, it's hard to say
without me reliving the day and all.

249
00:15:59,053 --> 00:16:01,567
<i>So, I guess we already talked</i>
<i>about Dad's phone calls...</i>

250
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,564
...and this thing with the apartment?
- Yep.

251
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:07,203
I think he knows I'm on to him,
because he's been way too nice.

252
00:16:07,493 --> 00:16:09,449
- Like he's hiding something.
<i>- Relax, Harry</i>.

253
00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:12,252
- Not everyone lives a secret life.
- Right, just you.

254
00:16:12,413 --> 00:16:13,641
<i>Goodbye, Harr.</i>

255
00:16:15,453 --> 00:16:16,727
Come on.

256
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:25,253
It's a black sack with presents in it.

257
00:16:25,413 --> 00:16:27,483
Yes, I understand the irony.

258
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,211
Yes.

259
00:16:29,373 --> 00:16:32,683
Can you just tell me when it's gonna
be released from processing, please?

260
00:16:32,853 --> 00:16:36,971
- Uh... Okay, thank you. God.
- No luck?

261
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:40,569
You'd think being the medical examiner
that I'd have some pull around here.

262
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,564
I know you want
to help Carrie and all...

263
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:45,088
...but technically,
those gifts were his possessions.

264
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:46,891
Which he was gonna give to the kids.

265
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:51,683
I think that it would be easier if I told
Carrie how I know it's gonna happen.

266
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:55,724
Okay, sorry.
Any word on that cadaver?

267
00:16:55,893 --> 00:16:58,327
All I know is the woman who asked
for help was murdered.

268
00:16:58,493 --> 00:17:01,883
I mean, I don't even have a name,
not to mention that the identity...

269
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:04,613
...of all anatomical gifts
are confidential.

270
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,128
So to make a long story suck,
I got nothing.

271
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:10,091
You know, there is one person
that would be able to help.

272
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:12,528
Someone who saw
what the victim saw when she died.

273
00:17:12,693 --> 00:17:14,331
No. No.
I mean, are you crazy?

274
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:17,485
- I can't trust him after what he's done.
- You said it yourself.

275
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:19,769
You have nothing.
Beggars can't be choosers.

276
00:17:19,933 --> 00:17:22,242
Can be smart enough to not buddy up
with the Reaper.

277
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:24,005
Ordinarily, I would agree with you.

278
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:27,609
But since no one's gonna die today,
what harm can he do?

279
00:17:29,853 --> 00:17:32,765
I'm sorry, Tru.
I'd love to help you. Really, I would.

280
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:36,369
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to hear
you say those two magic words.

281
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:37,852
- Please, Jack?
- Ooh.

282
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:41,085
Sorry. Those weren't the magic words
we were looking for.

283
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:43,164
- I knew this was a bad idea.
- Come on, Tru.

284
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,369
I just wanna hear
you say it one time.

285
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:48,206
- "Help me."
- Would you settle for "Bite me"?

286
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:50,842
Not if you want what's in here.

287
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:56,287
- Help me.
- I thought you'd never ask.

288
00:17:56,453 --> 00:17:58,011
Come on.

289
00:18:01,893 --> 00:18:04,407
I don't see why we couldn't carpool.

290
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:06,689
For someone who's dedicated
to saving lives...

291
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:09,686
...you should really take better care
of the environment, Tru.

292
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:12,162
I've got this thing about
not getting into a car...

293
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,324
...with a guy who kills people
for a living.

294
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,721
So, what are we doing here?

295
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:19,681
You wanted to know what I saw in the
victim's last day. Time for show-and-tell.

296
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:23,448
Most of it was pretty mundane. A sunrise
through a window, a taxi meter...

297
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:26,810
<i>... a young girl with pigtails.</i>
<i>Something that looked like curtains...</i>

298
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29,168
<i>... with red flowers on them</i>
<i>blowing in the wind.</i>

299
00:18:29,453 --> 00:18:32,286
And then this broken fence.

300
00:18:32,453 --> 00:18:36,241
I figured what better place
to begin than with the end.

301
00:18:36,973 --> 00:18:40,807
The last thing I saw
was falling off here.

302
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:46,803
Looks like we weren't
the first ones here today.

303
00:18:47,613 --> 00:18:50,685
What's your money on,
coincidence or connection?

304
00:18:50,853 --> 00:18:52,889
Only one way to find out.

305
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,882
Yes, hi. I just received the most
beautiful daisies, but the card fell off...

306
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:04,089
...so I have no idea who they're from.

307
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:07,768
I don't want the person to think that
I'm being rude by not saying thank you.

308
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:09,332
Yeah.

309
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:13,204
Ann Moore is the only person
who bought daisies so far today?

310
00:19:13,373 --> 00:19:16,524
- Thank you so much. Okay, bye-bye.
- Impressive.

311
00:19:16,693 --> 00:19:18,251
Thanks for your help, Jack.

312
00:19:18,573 --> 00:19:20,529
That's it?

313
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:23,526
Well, I needed a place to start,
and now I've got one.

314
00:19:23,693 --> 00:19:25,365
It's nothing personal.

315
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:28,605
Actually, it's completely personal.

316
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:30,241
Yeah.

317
00:19:36,973 --> 00:19:39,328
- Hi. Ann Moore?
- Yes.

318
00:19:39,493 --> 00:19:41,882
I'm from Hudson Medical School.
I'm doing a survey...

319
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:43,964
...of people who donated
a body to science.

320
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:46,772
- Now is not a good time.
- It'll only take a few minutes.

321
00:19:46,933 --> 00:19:50,721
- I need to identify a cadaver recently...
- Honestly, this isn't something I want...

322
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:53,691
...to spend Christmas Eve talking about.
If you'll excuse me.

323
00:19:53,853 --> 00:19:56,128
What my colleague failed to mention...

324
00:19:56,293 --> 00:19:59,046
...is that we pay for this information.

325
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:02,285
Come in.

326
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:07,084
This money couldn't come
at a better time.

327
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:10,928
- Things have been awful tight.
- We're just glad to be able to help.

328
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:13,891
So you're here to ask me
about my sister, Allison?

329
00:20:14,253 --> 00:20:15,652
Yeah.

330
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:17,531
This is her.

331
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:21,366
Do you mind if we ask
what happened to her?

332
00:20:22,453 --> 00:20:24,045
She was murdered.

333
00:20:24,213 --> 00:20:27,011
Six months ago,
by a man named Russell Marks.

334
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:31,086
They worked together and were
having a relationship on the side.

335
00:20:31,253 --> 00:20:34,165
That is, until Allison
found out he was married.

336
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,093
That night, she went over
to tell him it was over.

337
00:20:38,093 --> 00:20:40,926
It was the last time
anyone saw her alive.

338
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:43,125
I finished cleaning my room.

339
00:20:44,053 --> 00:20:46,123
Okay, hon.
Go get ready for church.

340
00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:48,602
That's the girl I saw in
the cadaver's memory.

341
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:52,051
- Pretty girl.
- Allison's.

342
00:20:52,933 --> 00:20:56,926
My sister was a single mom,
so now I am too.

343
00:20:57,093 --> 00:21:01,132
Miss Moore, if it's not too much, do you
know what happened to Russell Marks?

344
00:21:01,973 --> 00:21:03,645
Well...

345
00:21:03,813 --> 00:21:05,769
...he was arrested.

346
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:09,050
But the jury felt that there
was a lack of evidence.

347
00:21:09,213 --> 00:21:11,932
"Reasonable doubt," they said.

348
00:21:12,093 --> 00:21:14,288
I can't believe that he...

349
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:17,083
He gets to have a life...

350
00:21:17,253 --> 00:21:20,325
...shop for presents,
trim the tree with his wife...

351
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:24,930
...while Allison's body lies
in some dark, cold room somewhere.

352
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:28,690
Where's the justice in that?

353
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:32,646
I'm sorry.

354
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:35,281
Is there anything else?

355
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:38,886
Cambria and I have to go to church.

356
00:21:39,053 --> 00:21:41,886
Saint Matthew's is always
so crowded on Christmas Eve.

357
00:21:42,053 --> 00:21:45,568
No, that's it.
Thank you very much.

358
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:54,450
I don't even get a thanks?
I was brilliant back there.

359
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,650
Does the fourth Horseman of
the Apocalypse need a pat on the back?

360
00:21:57,813 --> 00:22:01,123
Whatever. The fact that I'm still here
means that you need me.

361
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:05,127
And that makes me feel
all warm and fuzzy inside.

362
00:22:05,293 --> 00:22:08,490
Well, be careful. You wouldn't want
the ice around your heart to melt.

363
00:22:08,653 --> 00:22:11,565
Cute. But seriously, what's next?

364
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:15,248
Since no one's life needs to be saved,
how do we help Allison Moore?

365
00:22:15,413 --> 00:22:17,847
There are a lot of ways
to save someone's life, Jack.

366
00:22:18,013 --> 00:22:21,449
- Stopping death is only one of them.
- That sister of hers seemed to have...

367
00:22:21,613 --> 00:22:23,808
...a significant ax to grind
with Russell Marks.

368
00:22:23,973 --> 00:22:26,851
- Maybe she was looking for payback.
- But no one dies, remember.

369
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,481
- No one has to.
- So you're saying attempted murder.

370
00:22:29,653 --> 00:22:33,441
- Because if she got caught...
- Then Allison's daughter would be alone.

371
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:35,012
Thus, the "Help me."

372
00:22:35,173 --> 00:22:39,212
We should find this Russell Marks today
and get there before Ann Moore does.

373
00:22:39,373 --> 00:22:41,523
Hey, Tru, I gotta talk to you about...

374
00:22:42,973 --> 00:22:45,771
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Nice to see you, Harrison.

375
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:49,289
Harry, it's okay, I got it under control.
What's up?

376
00:22:50,253 --> 00:22:52,084
Come here a second.

377
00:22:57,093 --> 00:23:00,768
Okay, I had a talk with Dad, asked him
point blank, "Are you having an affair?"

378
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:02,889
- And?
- He had an answer for everything.

379
00:23:03,053 --> 00:23:04,805
Yeah. What did I tell you?

380
00:23:04,973 --> 00:23:09,489
But then he said that that apartment
was where he meets his L.A. Partners.

381
00:23:09,653 --> 00:23:11,689
But get this.
I got an old poker buddy.

382
00:23:11,853 --> 00:23:14,083
He works for a car service
that handles the firm.

383
00:23:14,253 --> 00:23:17,848
Those L.A. Guys aren't due till
next week. See, something is going on.

384
00:23:18,013 --> 00:23:19,332
Tru, I can feel it.

385
00:23:19,493 --> 00:23:21,165
I'm gonna give you two privacy.

386
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,972
You know, that would be just perfect.

387
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:26,892
What, are you crazy?

388
00:23:27,053 --> 00:23:29,044
Why you all sleeping with the enemy?

389
00:23:29,213 --> 00:23:31,044
There's no "sleeping."
He's helping me.

390
00:23:31,213 --> 00:23:33,488
Bottom line, you can't trust him, Tru.

391
00:23:34,093 --> 00:23:36,163
He's probably screwing you right now.

392
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,410
Richard, I hope you're getting this.
Your son is still suspicious.

393
00:23:39,573 --> 00:23:41,609
You'd better get on this, or...

394
00:23:45,493 --> 00:23:47,245
...we're both screwed.

395
00:23:54,693 --> 00:23:57,082
Your brother was a tad frosty
to me back there.

396
00:23:57,253 --> 00:23:58,766
Is everything okay with him?

397
00:23:58,933 --> 00:24:00,764
You tried to kill him a few months back.

398
00:24:00,933 --> 00:24:01,968
Were you expecting a hug?

399
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:04,852
A short memory,
the key to a happy life.

400
00:24:05,893 --> 00:24:07,212
Ah!

401
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,052
- Can I help you?
- Hi, Mrs. Marks.

402
00:24:10,213 --> 00:24:13,842
My name's Jack Harper. We're actually
looking for your husband. Is he at home?

403
00:24:14,013 --> 00:24:18,370
Russell isn't speaking to the press.
I think he's made that perfectly clear.

404
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:21,889
We're not from the media. We're with
the Neighborhood Watch program.

405
00:24:22,053 --> 00:24:23,884
We're actually just looking
for volunteers.

406
00:24:24,053 --> 00:24:26,613
Oh. I'm so sorry.

407
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:29,412
We're newlyweds.
We just moved in down the block.

408
00:24:29,573 --> 00:24:33,851
I'm sure Russell would love to help out,
but he's out doing last-minute shopping.

409
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:36,049
But then I'm meeting him
at Saint Matthew's.

410
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:40,252
If you're looking for volunteers, church
is always a good place to find people.

411
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:42,131
- She's right.
- Thanks for your advice.

412
00:24:42,293 --> 00:24:45,569
- Maybe we'll see you there.
- Okay. Good luck.

413
00:24:49,013 --> 00:24:53,723
- Guess who else'll be at church tonight.
- Something tells me we should be there.

414
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:56,653
That's kind of cute. That's nice.

415
00:24:56,813 --> 00:24:58,690
I like it. Are those the eyes?

416
00:24:58,893 --> 00:25:01,851
- Santa's not coming, is he?
- Yes, he is.

417
00:25:02,013 --> 00:25:04,811
He is. It's just, you know
how those reindeer can be.

418
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:09,769
- That's very nice.
- Miss Allen, you promised us.

419
00:25:10,173 --> 00:25:12,607
I know. I did.

420
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:17,643
It's just that sometimes things
can happen, even to Santa.

421
00:25:17,813 --> 00:25:19,929
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

422
00:25:20,093 --> 00:25:22,209
- Who do you think that is?
- <i>Santa!</i>

423
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:23,931
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

424
00:25:24,093 --> 00:25:26,288
- Davis?
- No, it's Santa.

425
00:25:26,493 --> 00:25:29,883
- What are you doing?
- Explain later. Ho, ho, ho, ho.

426
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:32,891
Come on,
who wants to sit on Santa's lap?

427
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:35,525
Okay. Santa wants to make sure...

428
00:25:35,693 --> 00:25:38,412
...that everyone's gone
to the bathroom recently, yes?

429
00:25:38,573 --> 00:25:40,484
- Yes.
- Really?

430
00:25:40,653 --> 00:25:44,328
Really? Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

431
00:25:47,173 --> 00:25:48,606
Are you even allowed in here?

432
00:25:48,773 --> 00:25:51,048
I'm not the one screwing with
the big guy's plans.

433
00:25:51,213 --> 00:25:54,046
If anyone's getting struck by lightning,
my money's on you.

434
00:25:54,213 --> 00:25:57,125
Okay, so tell me the truth.
Why are you really helping me today?

435
00:25:57,293 --> 00:26:00,410
As far as I'm concerned,
as long as the dead stay dead...

436
00:26:00,573 --> 00:26:03,724
...there's no harm in giving
a little help to the living.

437
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:07,730
Or maybe I just didn't want
to spend Christmas Eve by myself.

438
00:26:10,453 --> 00:26:12,364
There's our man.

439
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:15,570
Mr. Marks? We don't want
to cause any trouble...

440
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:18,452
...but we're friends of the Moores,
and you should know...

441
00:26:18,613 --> 00:26:20,843
...that Ann and Cambria
are gonna be here today.

442
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:23,891
Look, Ann is still very angry
about her sister's death.

443
00:26:24,053 --> 00:26:27,170
Rather than disrupt the services,
we thought we'd forewarn you.

444
00:26:28,013 --> 00:26:32,211
Look, I appreciate what you're
trying to do, but I'm an innocent man.

445
00:26:32,413 --> 00:26:36,292
- And I need to move on with my life.
- And what about Allison Moore's life?

446
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:40,684
- Thank you for your concern.
- Russell.

447
00:26:41,973 --> 00:26:44,567
I'm gonna go enjoy the services
with my wife now.

448
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:46,405
Excuse me.

449
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:51,926
Well, that went well.

450
00:26:52,093 --> 00:26:54,482
I'm starting to think the jury
was right about Marks.

451
00:26:54,653 --> 00:26:57,850
- What makes you say that?
- If there's one thing I know, it's killers.

452
00:26:58,013 --> 00:27:01,449
Once you take a human life, it's like
a smell that you can't wash off...

453
00:27:01,613 --> 00:27:04,286
...no matter how hard you try.
And that guy...

454
00:27:04,453 --> 00:27:07,286
...he ain't got the funk.

455
00:27:07,453 --> 00:27:09,523
Ho, ho, ho.
What would you like for Christmas?

456
00:27:09,693 --> 00:27:11,490
- A ferret.
- A ferret?

457
00:27:11,653 --> 00:27:13,609
Okay, I don't think
I have any of those.

458
00:27:13,773 --> 00:27:17,368
But have you ever considered
a bone saw?

459
00:27:17,693 --> 00:27:20,969
To cut wood
for a really neat tree house.

460
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:23,806
- Thanks, Santa!
- Yeah. Ho, ho.

461
00:27:23,973 --> 00:27:26,487
And what about you?
What would you like for Christmas?

462
00:27:26,653 --> 00:27:27,847
A bone saw.

463
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:34,568
I think I'm all out of those.
But how about a splatter guard...

464
00:27:35,773 --> 00:27:39,209
...to keep blood
from splattering on your face.

465
00:27:39,413 --> 00:27:43,042
- You're the coolest Santa ever.
- Thank you. Ho, ho, ho.

466
00:27:43,213 --> 00:27:47,411
And for you, there's a rib separator.

467
00:27:47,613 --> 00:27:50,081
And how about some forceps.

468
00:27:55,813 --> 00:27:58,407
I guess all I can do now is keep
Ann Moore away from him.

469
00:27:58,573 --> 00:28:01,133
Yeah, well, if that's the case, then...

470
00:28:01,293 --> 00:28:03,329
Showtime. There she is.

471
00:28:21,653 --> 00:28:23,450
Come on, we're going home.

472
00:28:23,613 --> 00:28:26,047
- That's it?
- Nothing happened.

473
00:28:26,213 --> 00:28:29,125
- Maybe it hasn't happened yet.
- All right, we gotta split up.

474
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:31,682
One of us follows Ann,
the other stays with Russell.

475
00:28:31,853 --> 00:28:34,367
Okay, I'll stay with Russell.
You follow Ann.

476
00:28:34,533 --> 00:28:37,047
But if anything happens to her,
so help me, Jack.

477
00:28:37,213 --> 00:28:39,727
Helping you is what I'm doing, Tru.

478
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:16,768
What do you mean, you can't stay?
Don't we have other things to talk about?

479
00:29:16,933 --> 00:29:18,810
Hi, Dad.

480
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:23,806
- Harrison, what are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same thing.

481
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:27,722
Well, I guess you've already
spoiled the surprise.

482
00:29:28,373 --> 00:29:30,682
- Surprise?
- I just signed the lease.

483
00:29:33,053 --> 00:29:35,044
Merry Christmas, son.

484
00:29:35,213 --> 00:29:36,441
It's all yours.

485
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:39,161
What? This place? What is...?

486
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:41,968
I may not be able to give
my new employee a raise.

487
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:45,330
But the partners can't say anything
about a father giving to his son.

488
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,969
I've been working on this for weeks.
But you almost blew the whole thing.

489
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:51,647
- I'm sorry. I was thinking...
- Forget it. Forget it.

490
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:54,404
It all worked out.

491
00:29:54,853 --> 00:29:56,844
Oh, wow.

492
00:29:57,893 --> 00:30:00,168
- Merry Christmas, Dad.
- You too.

494
00:30:17,653 --> 00:30:19,006
Jensen.

495
00:30:19,773 --> 00:30:22,571
Hey, stranger.
What are you doing here?

496
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:27,092
I guess I just wanted to see what it is
I've been missing out on all these years.

497
00:30:28,413 --> 00:30:30,404
And pay my respects.

498
00:30:31,613 --> 00:30:33,490
Who's that for?

499
00:30:33,653 --> 00:30:35,530
That's for my uncle.

500
00:30:35,693 --> 00:30:38,082
He died of a heart attack last year.

501
00:30:38,453 --> 00:30:42,492
And that's for my cousin, who
passed away when we were little kids.

502
00:30:43,213 --> 00:30:46,205
You know, think about this.
If things had gone differently...

503
00:30:46,373 --> 00:30:50,651
...you might be lighting one for me.
- But things didn't go differently.

504
00:30:50,813 --> 00:30:53,486
There but for the grace of Tru go I.

505
00:30:57,653 --> 00:30:59,132
So...

506
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:01,411
...who's that one for?

507
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:13,211
Nobody.

508
00:31:15,453 --> 00:31:17,648
I gotta get back to the lab, so I'II...

509
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:20,846
- I'll see you later.
- Hey, Jensen...

510
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,802
...Mr. Gorenstein doesn't need
the company tonight.

511
00:31:23,973 --> 00:31:26,009
So I say you ditch the lab...

512
00:31:26,173 --> 00:31:29,324
...and you join me and my brother
for Christmas Eve dinner.

513
00:31:29,493 --> 00:31:32,565
You know, in the spirit
of doing something new each day.

514
00:31:34,813 --> 00:31:36,769
Okay. I'll try.

515
00:31:47,493 --> 00:31:48,892
Way of doing this.

517
00:31:52,253 --> 00:31:54,164
- Hello.
- All right, I followed Ann home.

518
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:57,166
She's not doing much except
the crossword puzzle. How's Marks?

519
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,722
On his way home.
We must have missed something.

520
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,842
Maybe Allison Moore's "Help me"
had nothing to do with revenge.

521
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:06,691
Hold on.

522
00:32:13,173 --> 00:32:15,084
Cambria!

523
00:32:15,253 --> 00:32:16,925
Cambria!

524
00:32:17,093 --> 00:32:19,482
Tru, I think I know who
Allison wanted us to stop.

525
00:32:19,653 --> 00:32:22,645
It wasn't Ann.
It was her daughter.

526
00:32:32,293 --> 00:32:33,851
Do you know who I am?

527
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:36,211
Of course.

528
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:38,603
From the trial, right?
That's how you know?

529
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:40,930
Is there anything I can do for you?

530
00:32:41,813 --> 00:32:44,646
You can admit
what you did to my mom.

531
00:32:44,813 --> 00:32:47,281
Look, Cambria, I think you should...

532
00:32:47,493 --> 00:32:49,290
You think I should what?

533
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:53,403
Forgive you?
Or make you pay for what you did...

534
00:32:53,573 --> 00:32:56,246
...before you have a chance
to do it to someone else?

535
00:33:05,853 --> 00:33:07,491
Please, honey.

536
00:33:08,093 --> 00:33:12,371
I loved your mother. I would never have
done anything to hurt her.

537
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:15,366
- No, that's not true!
- I was ready to give up everything.

538
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:20,206
My job, my marriage,
just for a chance to be with her.

539
00:33:22,253 --> 00:33:25,051
Cambria, do you remember me?

540
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:27,681
I'm a friend of your aunt's.

541
00:33:28,213 --> 00:33:29,851
This isn't what she wants.

542
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:33,130
She's angry. She misses
your mom just like you do.

543
00:33:33,293 --> 00:33:34,646
But this isn't the answer.

544
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:37,966
We don't get to decide
who lives and who dies...

545
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:40,931
...who's guilty and who's not.
That's not the way it works.

546
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:43,203
- It's out of our hands.
- You don't understand.

547
00:33:43,373 --> 00:33:45,011
He killed her and got away with it.

548
00:33:45,173 --> 00:33:48,165
And nothing you do here
is gonna change that.

549
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:50,164
Look, it won't bring your mom back...

550
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:52,722
...and it won't bring your aunt
any more peace.

551
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:55,886
No one's gonna die tonight.
You're not even gonna hurt him.

552
00:33:56,373 --> 00:33:59,285
You'll miss, and then the only one
who will pay is you.

553
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:01,125
What's going on?

554
00:34:01,293 --> 00:34:04,205
- My God, what is this?
- Honey, go back inside.

555
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:11,962
Something that looked like curtains
with red flowers blowing in the wind.

556
00:34:12,413 --> 00:34:13,892
Maybe it wasn't curtains.

557
00:34:15,613 --> 00:34:18,332
You don't know what you're
talking about. I won't miss.

558
00:34:18,493 --> 00:34:21,451
Okay, and if you don't,
then you've just killed someone.

559
00:34:21,613 --> 00:34:24,332
That's something you're gonna
have to live with every day...

560
00:34:24,493 --> 00:34:26,404
...for the rest of your life.

561
00:34:27,373 --> 00:34:28,931
Isn't that right, Mrs. Marks?

562
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:32,211
What's she talking about?

563
00:34:32,373 --> 00:34:34,841
L... I have no idea.

564
00:34:35,013 --> 00:34:39,211
Cambria, don't make an innocent man
pay for someone else's crime.

566
00:34:49,093 --> 00:34:51,323
I know this is a lot to ask...

567
00:34:51,493 --> 00:34:53,802
...but hopefully you won't need
to press charges.

568
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:56,124
No.

569
00:34:56,933 --> 00:34:59,572
I think she's been through
enough already.

570
00:34:59,733 --> 00:35:01,405
You're just gonna let her go?

571
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:05,363
What about us?
Haven't we been through enough?

572
00:35:05,533 --> 00:35:08,764
You're saying she should pay for trying
to take your husband from you?

573
00:35:08,933 --> 00:35:12,926
- Exactly.
- Just like Allison Moore, right?

574
00:35:13,933 --> 00:35:16,049
You need to talk to your wife.

575
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:37,731
Russell.

576
00:35:47,173 --> 00:35:49,403
I did it for us.

578
00:35:52,453 --> 00:35:53,932
Don't tell me.

579
00:35:56,853 --> 00:35:58,650
Tell them.

580
00:36:17,653 --> 00:36:20,645
Thank you for everything
you did today.

581
00:36:20,813 --> 00:36:25,603
I would be more thankful if I understood
how you knew to actually do it, but...

582
00:36:27,053 --> 00:36:28,964
Davis.

583
00:36:32,053 --> 00:36:36,683
I've been thinking about what the best
thing is to give you for Christmas.

584
00:36:37,853 --> 00:36:40,367
I think the best gift
I can give you is...

585
00:36:41,213 --> 00:36:45,286
Is the truth about my life.

586
00:36:46,253 --> 00:36:47,811
What do you mean?

587
00:36:48,813 --> 00:36:52,089
You know how you were asking me how
I knew Santa wasn't gonna show up?

588
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:53,572
Yeah.

589
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:58,086
It's an interesting story, really. Um...

590
00:36:58,253 --> 00:37:00,562
It's one that I'm not supposed
to talk about.

591
00:37:02,293 --> 00:37:05,808
Davis, you know
that you can tell me anything.

592
00:37:08,053 --> 00:37:10,044
Yeah, I know that. It's...

593
00:37:12,093 --> 00:37:14,129
This is about Tru.

594
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:19,964
So I gotta ask,
why call the cops about Mrs. Marks?

595
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:23,045
The case was closed.
Why put the family through that again?

596
00:37:23,213 --> 00:37:26,125
You know how you said if there's
one thing you know, it's a killer?

597
00:37:26,293 --> 00:37:28,045
Well, I know victims.

598
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:31,683
I know what it's like to lose someone
and not know who took them from you.

599
00:37:31,853 --> 00:37:34,890
I guess I owed a girl
who lost her mom.

600
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:38,284
I gotta tell you, it was cool
to wear the white hat for a change.

601
00:37:38,453 --> 00:37:40,489
So you're admitting
that I'm the good guy?

602
00:37:41,373 --> 00:37:44,809
Do you know why they gave the white
hat to the hero in the Old West movies?

603
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:47,282
It made them easier to light
for the camera.

604
00:37:47,453 --> 00:37:49,683
The color of the hat
is not about right or wrong.

605
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:51,889
It's about what you choose to see.

606
00:37:53,453 --> 00:37:56,172
- Well, I'm this way.
- And I'm this way.

607
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:59,609
- So I guess I'll be seeing you.
- Until the day you quit.

608
00:37:59,773 --> 00:38:01,001
Or you do.

609
00:38:03,373 --> 00:38:05,011
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

610
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:07,085
It was.

611
00:38:07,253 --> 00:38:09,209
Merry Christmas, Tru.

612
00:38:14,733 --> 00:38:17,770
Maybe I just didn't want
to spend Christmas Eve by myself.

613
00:38:20,413 --> 00:38:21,687
Hey, Jack.

614
00:38:22,973 --> 00:38:25,612
Okay, this doesn't mean
that I've forgiven you...

615
00:38:25,773 --> 00:38:30,528
...and this changes
absolutely nothing between us...

616
00:38:30,693 --> 00:38:35,562
...but I've always had this feeling that
no one should be alone on Christmas Eve.

617
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:53,445
Oh, look who finally showed up.

618
00:38:53,613 --> 00:38:56,252
- Hey.
- Twice in one day. What a treat.

619
00:38:56,413 --> 00:38:59,962
Relax, Harry, okay?
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

620
00:39:00,133 --> 00:39:02,408
What, pass up the chance
to meet all your friends?

621
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:05,371
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

622
00:39:05,573 --> 00:39:10,647
- What was that? If it's a call for...
- Look... Merry Christmas, for now.

623
00:39:10,813 --> 00:39:12,690
Okay?

624
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,565
- Hey.
- Hey.

625
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:17,849
I hope you don't mind.
I brought Moe and Curly.

626
00:39:18,053 --> 00:39:20,567
Yes. We took your advice,
and we called the airlines...

627
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,325
...and our flights were cancelled. So...

628
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:24,768
We'd be spending
Christmas Eve in an airport.

629
00:39:24,933 --> 00:39:28,084
Uh-huh. So Jensen is not the only one
who owes you one.

630
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,530
It was just a hunch.

631
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:32,883
Yes. Merry Christmas.

632
00:39:33,053 --> 00:39:35,965
Hey! Davis, I thought you guys were
having your own holiday dinner.

633
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:39,762
We did. But then Davis said that Harrison
has a habit of standing you up...

634
00:39:39,933 --> 00:39:42,606
...and we didn't want you to be alone.
- Are you okay?

635
00:39:42,773 --> 00:39:45,287
You never called me to see
how things were with Jack.

636
00:39:45,453 --> 00:39:47,967
- Oh, right. Yeah, how did that go?
- Fine.

637
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:52,411
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah. It's probably just the eggnog.

638
00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:54,851
Well, we'll talk later, okay?

639
00:39:58,573 --> 00:40:00,882
When are you gonna tell her
that I know the secret?

640
00:40:01,253 --> 00:40:03,608
No, seriously, it's got cuffs.
Right here.

641
00:40:05,853 --> 00:40:08,162
We have the best dad
in the freaking world.

642
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:10,005
He got me an apartment.

643
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:11,970
He got it pimped out, everything.

644
00:40:12,133 --> 00:40:15,045
- Mighty generous.
- No, not generous, well earned.

645
00:40:16,533 --> 00:40:18,091
Hey.

646
00:40:21,613 --> 00:40:23,046
- Jack Harper.
- Hi.

647
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:26,091
Yeah, this is my dad, Richard.
Richard, Jack.

648
00:40:26,253 --> 00:40:27,891
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

649
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:30,248
- You work with my daughter?
- A competitor, actually.

650
00:40:30,413 --> 00:40:31,402
Oh.

651
00:40:32,053 --> 00:40:33,850
Excuse me.

652
00:40:39,853 --> 00:40:41,172
Long day?

653
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:42,561
Aren't they all?

654
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:44,849
In my endless pursuit
of the holiday spirit...

655
00:40:45,013 --> 00:40:48,289
...there's one thing I haven't done yet.
- What's that?

656
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:50,846
Oh.

657
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:03,203
- Wasn't he supposed to be one of yours?
- Give it time.

658
00:41:05,693 --> 00:41:07,729
And what about the mole?

659
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,130
She's got him.

660
00:41:17,813 --> 00:41:19,644
Merry Christmas.

661
00:41:23,253 --> 00:41:25,448
- I'm gonna go.
- Yeah.

662
00:41:35,653 --> 00:41:37,564
There's the guy making out
with my sister.

663
00:41:37,733 --> 00:41:39,291
