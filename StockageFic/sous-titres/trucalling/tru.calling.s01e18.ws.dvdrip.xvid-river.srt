00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,142
Yeah. Have you heard of me?

346
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,273
Sort of. There was this guy
outside your building this morning...

347
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:41,308
asking all these questions about you.
He seemed pretty belligerent.

348
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:44,412
About 6', dark brown hair?

349
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,725
Same guy who just can't take no
for an answer?

350
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,491
Only he's not an ex.

351
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,729
Well, it's nothing l should get into.

352
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,826
lf you're heading home,
l could walk with you.

353
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,371
You know, in case he's still around.

354
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,906
-Okay.
-Okay.

355
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,943
CHRlS: lt was six months ago...

356
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,943
when l found out he'd stolen my identity.

357
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:10,243
l was applying for a loan,
and the bank ran a credit check.

358
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,341
They found 10 different credit cards
in my name.

359
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,683
He'd used them to run up
nearly $60,000 in charges.

360
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,346
And now he's threatening you?

361
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:21,221
-Because l went to the police.
-No arrest?

362
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,227
lD theft's tricky to prosecute.

363
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,264
You need absolute proof,
which l don't have.

364
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:30,995
But it's getting worse because now l feel
like someone's been watching me.

365
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,739
That's creepy.
Any idea how this all started?

366

373
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,290
No problem.

374
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,318

there's no telling what might happen.

The guy who was supposed to take it...

run it by his girlfriend or something.

The thing is, it's in the building
across the street from yours...

She would never do that!

681
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:47,318
lt's okay, Matt.
You're not the only one that she's fooled.

682
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:50,451
But l'm telling you the truth.
She's stolen thousands of dollars.

683
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,689
She's ruined people's lives.

684
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,124
She's a thief?

685
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,031
l'm sorry.

686
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:01,769
[Matt breathing heavily]

687
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,245
MATT: l'm sorry.

688
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,717
TRU: Are you okay?

689
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,583
Why did you come here?
l thought that we had an agreement.

690
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,015
Yeah, we did.

691
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:26,795
Till l found out
that the money she gave me was fake.

692
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:30,800
Now she's gone, l'm still broke...

693
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,900
and l'm probably
never gonna see her again.

694
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,062
You never know.

695
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,269
Stranger things have happened.

696
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:47,283
l don't understand what's taking so long.
lt's been 45 minutes already.

697
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:48,875
l'm very sorry.

698
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,778
Did my card not go through?

699
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:53,119
The card number's fine,
but our computer's down.

700
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:57,456
Just give us another minute,
we'll get you all sorted out, Miss Davies.

701
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:59,519
TRU: Heading out of town, Tru?

702
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:04,995
You know, it's a good thing
l don't believe every sob story l hear.

703
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,696
Mine, for example?

704
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,136
You almost had me.

705
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,969
But then you absolutely blew it
back there at the diner.

706
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,667
This one's on me.

707
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:20,744
You pulled out your camera cell phone
the second l put my credit card down.

708
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,116
All l had to do
was call the credit card company...

709
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,178
and report a stolen credit card.

710
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:29,317
l knew you had the number,
but l was hoping that you wouldn't use it.

711
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,189
Then l got the call.

712
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:36,763
WOMAN: <i>Miss, there's activity reported</i>
<i>on your credit card at A vaIon Car RentaI.</i>

713
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,199
TRU: Thank you.

714
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,406
ls it too late for me to explain?

715
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:45,203
To me? Yeah.

716
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:48,676
But l know a couple of guys
who'd be happy to listen.

719
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,218
The perfect afternoon
with the perfect guy.

720
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,315
Wait, you were with my brother?

721
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,791
No. Harrison was his usual self.

722
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:07,126
Called to cancel after l was already there.

723
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:08,756
But that's how l spotted Randall.

724
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:09,822
Randall?

725
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,494
l met him a few years ago
when l was studying abroad.

726
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:16,700
<i>He's actuaIIy in town for a few weeks</i>

728

Just when l was starting to think
they didn't make them like this anymore.

729
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,638
Yeah, l know what you mean.

730
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:26,306

Hey, Luc, it's me, Tru.

734
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:39,927
l heard through the grapevine...

735
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,659
<i>that you missed out on that apartment</i>
<i>across the street...</i>

736

Just to know you were close.

No, Tru. lt's me, l'm sorry.

744
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:20,197
l saw the morgue number and thought
he was working tonight. What's up?

745
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,762
l talked to my friend at Schenkman.

746
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,967
What l had to tell you
is definitely about Jack.

747
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,944
Turns out he was a patient there.

748
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:32,813
A patient?
But Schenkman's a psychiatric facility.

749
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,511
lt seems like he was there voluntarily.

750
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,851
He checked himself in
so he could check himself out.

751
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:42,151
Well, we knew
something was off with Jack, but--

DAVlS: <i>There's more.</i>

753
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:46,457
<i>When Jack committed himseIf,</i>
<i>he thought he was going crazy.</i>

754

But the doctors couldn't diagnosis it.

755
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,526
Going crazy how?

756
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:54,968
