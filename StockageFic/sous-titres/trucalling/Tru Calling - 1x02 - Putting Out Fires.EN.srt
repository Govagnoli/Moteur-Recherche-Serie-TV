1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,363
So, Lindsay, this is the sign- in room...

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:07,372
and this is what we call
the standards room.

3
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:10,208
Nice. Very goth.

4
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:13,635
So what happens in here?

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,674
This is where we measure and weigh
the dead bodies.

6
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,945
Okay, Tru.

7
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:28,357
Okay, let's be honest here.
You're cute, you're 22 years old.

8
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:31,022
There are better career opportunities
out there for you.

9
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:34,328
I told you, working here will help me
get into med school.

10
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,665
Then at least get off the graveyard shift.
I mean...

11
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:41,331
all the good parties start after midnight,
and who am I gonna go with now?

12
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:45,707
You'll survive. Besides, I think I might
be able to do some good by working here.

13
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,974
How? Everyone's already dead.

14
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,348
Not everyone.
You're not gonna believe this.

15
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:55,354
I just fished a tennis ball
out of a guy's large intestine.

16
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:56,446
Hello.

17
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,219
Remind me to cancel
my tennis club membership.

18
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,021
Lindsay, Davis, my boss.

19
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,825
- Davis, Lindsay, my best friend.
- Hi. It's nice to meet you.

20
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:06,758
I'm good, really.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,968
I was just leaving.

22
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:13,071
Tru, thank you for the tour.

23
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,204
And we're still on for shopping tomorrow?

24
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,243
Absolutely.
Okay, great.

25
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:23,181
See you tomorrow.

26
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,443
Look, Tru...

27
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:27,315
I know that the morgue
is not exactly Party Central...

28
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,981
but don't worry, things will pick up.

29
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,883
Actually, that's what I'm afraid of.

30
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:57,280
My kid's in that building! He's upstairs!
Someone's gotta get him! Please go!

31
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,442
Yes, ma'am, we'll get him!

32
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,656
Come here. I got you.

33
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:31,539
How about those Giants today?
That's seven in a row, my man.

34
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,950
Talk about really being on fire.

35
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,222
Go downstairs!

36
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,760
You're stuck!
I'm fine! Go!

37
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,828
No, come on!
Listen to me.

38
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:55,305
I'll be down in a minute, okay?
Don't worry about me.

39
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,605
Go on.

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,804
Go!

41
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:27,662
Help me.

42
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,599
Hey, gorgeous.

43
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,729
I didn't want to wake you.

44
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,497
Where are you going?

45
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:02,463
I am having breakfast with Dean Hazelton.

46
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,068
Oh, yeah?

47
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:07,237
Yeah, it looks like a post's
opened up in the psych department...

48
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,008
and if I kiss up to the old windbag...

49
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,108
you will be dating
a fully tenured professor.

50
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,680
Let me ask you.

51
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,850
What do you think of this?

52
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,292
Very suave.

53
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,197
How was work last night?

54
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,764
Pretty dead.

55
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,336
That's funny. That's clever.

56
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,805
Why don't you
get back to sleep, beautiful?

57
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:43,739
They said five minutes
for a table. It's been 10 minutes already.

58
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:46,947
You okay?

59
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,178
Yeah. What could be wrong?

60
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:51,547
Let's see...

61
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,720
last time we talked, you told me
that dead people were talking to you...

62
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,355
so I thought I might be remiss
if I didn't follow up.

63
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,763
I'm fine, Harrison. Everything's fine.
WAITRESS: Two?

64
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,028
WAITRESS: Your table's ready.
Finally.

65
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,397
See, you're a lousy liar, Tru.

66
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,597
I want to know what's going on.

67
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,232
- Trust me, you don't.
- What?

68
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:13,174
All of a sudden, you can't confide in me?

69
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,447
Your brother?

70
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,750
You really want to know?

71
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,714
So let me get this straight.

72
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,652
You know, to recap.

73
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,326
The dead people,
they ask for your help in the morgue.

74
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:28,724
Just once.

75
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,229
It happened once. Hopefully, only once.

76
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,957
And then you got propelled.

77
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,402
That's the word you used, right?
Propelled back to yesterday?

78
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,438
I relived the day, yes.

79
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,572
So you were able to save the lady's life
because she wasn't dead yet?

80
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,312
Tru, what can I say?

81
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,587
You're my sister, and I'll always love you.

82
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,647
I know it sounds a little crazy, but....

83
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,124
Smooth move.

84
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,984
A little crazy? No.

85
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,659
The run with the bulls
is a little crazy. Skydiving.

86
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,100
Dating actresses is a little crazy. This?

87
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,136
This is certifiably insane.

88
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,902
Harrison, I'm not lying,
and I don't think I'm nuts, either.

89
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:20,212
You really relived the day?

90
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,783
Then you tell me this...

91
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,247
who's gonna win the Tigers game today?

92
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,650
What?

93
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,255
Rosemary and 24th.

94
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,826
Great. Traffic's gonna be jammed
clear downtown.

95
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,095
Catch you later.

96
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,045
You dog.

97
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:10,228
You were dating a professor and,
telling me just what, slipped your mind?

98
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,423
I knew you wouldn't approve.

99
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,630
I'm stunned.
Me, too.

100
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:18,268
- I thought things were good with him.
- No, I'm talking about us.

101
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,635
We're friends. Best friends.

102
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:25,802
Okay, now I get why
you've been acting so strange lately.

103
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:30,146
Okay, you can't keep secrets
from your friends. Especially me.

104
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:34,047
I just feel so stupid. I mean, you know me.
I don't even fall for guys often.

105
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,645
But when you do fall, you fall hard.

106
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,354
Excuse me?

107
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,886
Very nice. Yeah.

108
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,127
So anyway, what did you do
when you caught him with the bim?

109
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,428
Nothing.

110
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,564
- Nothing?
- I froze.

111
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,306
You caught your boyfriend in the act,
and you froze.

112
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,607
God, do you know what
I would have done to him?

113
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,045
I would have humiliated him.

114
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:05,311
I would have made him wish
he'd never ever met me.

115
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:10,422
Tru, you just blew the perfect opportunity
to put that jerk in his place.

116
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,153
I gotta go.
Where?

117
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,217
More abuse. Bye.

118
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,060
- I'm worried about you.
- Me?

119
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,494
Yeah. What's with this morgue thing?

120
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:31,136
It's my job. And it's a good thing to have
on my résumé for med school.

121
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,701
It's a little odd, don't you think?

122
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:38,781
To work at the same morgue where
they brought Mom after she was killed?

123
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,378
What?

124
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,114
What are you talking about?

125
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,422
My God, you really don't remember,
do you?

126
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:53,323
Still, working there's kind of ghoulish,
don't you think?

127
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,903
Tru, whatever you're trying
to accomplish...

128
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,702
Mom's gone.

129
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,766
Nothing can bring her back.

130
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,852
What's so interesting?
Nothing.

131
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:28,822
Are those intake files from '93?
It's nothing, Davis.

132
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,163
'93 was a very bad year.

133
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,732
Why's that?

134
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,105
The death rate in the city was low,
maybe the lowest in the country...

135
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,902
and then, after '93,
it just went up like a skyrocket.

136
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:44,911
lncoming.

137
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,258
This is Samantha Block.

138
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:57,595
My God.
Died of smoke inhalation.

139
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,063
The fire started
on the fourth floor around 5:00.

140
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,498
The firemen thought
they'd cleared the building.

141
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,536
She was hiding under the bed.

142
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,802
What started the fire?

143
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,540
Gas explosion.

144
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,272
This one here is Nick Kelly, a civilian.

145
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,405
He saved a 12- year- old boy,
smoke got him, too.

146
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,051
The victim has a broken ankle.

147
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,752
Probably trying to get out.
Old buildings are death traps.

148
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,996
Discoloration of the cheeks.
From what?

149
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,128
Might indicate inhalation
of a chemical compound.

150
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,469
I'm guessing dimethyl benzene.

151
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,469
Is this guy a genius or what?

152
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,407
Genius, you owe me $20.
The Tigers shut them out tonight.

153
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,672
Patterson threw a two- hitter.

154
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,014
What's dimethyl benzene?

155
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,417
lndustrial uses, mainly.

156
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,551
Her, too. They must have
ingested it from the smoke.

157
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,315
Cotton fibers plastered
on the epidermal layer.

158
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,554
And it's red and something else.

159
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,028
<i>It's hard to teII. </i>

160
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,160
So young.

161
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,360
Damn tragedy is what it is.

162
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,616
I don't know if I can take this.

163
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:31,455
Believe it or not, it actually gets easier.

164
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,819
Besides, I like to think
they're going to a better place.

165
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,523
You believe that?

166
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:43,957
Well, if you're gonna work here,
you gotta believe it.

167
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,270
Of course, the dead get off easy.

168
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:51,137
It's the ones left behind
that gotta deal with all the pain.

169
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,452
Renee says she ain't gonna
hook you up.

170
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,920
No more of her friends.
Why not?

171
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:06,390
'Cause you're scaring them off, man.

172
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,053
You're a nice guy,
but you come on too strong.

173
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,289
It was only eight e- mails.

174
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:12,924
<i>HeIp me. </i>

175
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,125
You just gotta play it cool.

176
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,236
Did you guys hear that?

177
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,669
Hear what?

178
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,003
Nothing. Never mind.

179
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,011
Tru, let me ask you.
When you go out with a guy...

180
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,879
you want him to lay back a little, right?
And make you earn it.

181
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,178
<i>HeIp me. </i>

182
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,716
I'll be right back.

183
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,553
She's hot. Weird, but hot.

184
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:09,713
<i>HeIp me. </i>

185
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,531
Help me.

186
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,278
Hey, gorgeous.

187
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,640
Where are you going?

188
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,316
I've got a breakfast with Dean Hazelton.

189
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,558
Tru!

190
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,430
Sorry, what?

191
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:33,999
I asked what you thought of this.
How's this look?

192
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,273
Yeah, it looks fine.

193
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,608
Breakfast with the Dean?
That's a surprise.

194
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,847
Yeah, there's a post that's gonna open up
in the psych department.

195
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:50,445
If I kiss up to the old windbag...

196
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,548
then you will be dating
a fully tenured professor.

197
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,287
That's a good one.

198
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,628
- What?
- Opportunity.

199
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,597
It's a good opportunity.

200
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,995
So you're sure about the jacket?

201
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,637
Yeah, very suave.

202
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,832
So suave, in fact...

203
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,740
that I think you should
stick around for a while.

204
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:17,577
I can't. I gotta go meet the Dean.
But I will see you tonight.

205
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:39,869
Um....

206
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,735
You realize you were hired
for the night shift, don't you?

207
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,712
Do you ever actually go home?

208
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,282
I could ask you the same question.

209
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:58,016
I just thought if I'm gonna do a good job,
I'd better get to know the system.

210
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,686
Diligent.

211
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,686
Enough with the crypt.
Let's check out the database, yeah?

212
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,126
Municipal database.
What are you doing with that?

213
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,366
Just a little research.

214
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,295
Who's Nick Kelly?

215
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,162
What do you know.

216
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,097
He's a fireman.

217
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,495
- Can I help you, miss?
- Yes. I'm looking for Nick Kelly.

218
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:47,829
Hey, Nick?
Yo.

219
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,337
Somebody to see you.

220
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,842
Hi, I'm Nick.

221
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,680
Hi. Can we talk?

222
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,516
- 84 Hastings?
- Yeah, that's the one.

223
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,251
That's right down the block from me.

224
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:09,089
What makes you think that
that building's a fire hazard?

225
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,129
No reason in particular.

226
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,799
I'm doing a fire risk assessment
in prewar buildings...

227
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,892
for my architecture class.

228
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,599
- That's a weird assignment.
- Weird professor.

229
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:25,031
Yeah, I'd be happy to go down
and take a look at that unit for you.

230
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,772
What do you say, about 5:00?

231
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,805
The fire started around 5:00.

232
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,842
5:00 is too late. I'm supposed to be
in my professor's office at 2:00.

233
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,013
And this really can't wait?

234
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,087
Not if I want to pass.

235
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:41,852
Okay, what the hell.

236
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:45,294
Things are slow around here,
anyway. Let me ask you something.

237
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,796
- Why me?
- Sorry?

238
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:53,304
You could've asked any one of these guys
for help, but you asked for me.

239
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,602
I have the calendar.

240
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:04,313
That was for charity.
It's the Widows and Orphans Fund.

241
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,575
Okay, Mr. September.

242
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,791
I wasn't here for the last
fire inspection. I spent the night in the ER.

243
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,961
Wedding ring dropped down
the garbage disposal.

244
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,231
I put my hand in, almost lost two fingers.

245
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:30,399
I said to my wife,"If that doesn't
scream commitment, what does?"

246
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:33,967
- We just want to check the furnace.
- No problem. The basement's down here.

247
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,445
- That shirt was a gift from your father.
- I hate it.

248
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,313
It makes me look like a geek.
It's what a loser would wear.

249
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:43,081
You're wearing it, and that's final.
What's gotten into you?

250
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,923
<i>Take your sister outside and pIay. </i>

251
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,323
What do you say, Samantha?

252
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,492
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

253
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,094
She's a sweetheart.
She is, isn't she?

254
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,196
She turns 7 next week.

255
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,501
Yeah, I hope so.

256
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,045
Creepy.
Come on.

257
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,349
Watch your step.

258
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,794
What are we doing?

259
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,955
First rule of fire risk assessment...

260
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:32,299
you want to check all mains
and all pipelines for gas leaks.

261
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,966
You might want to take some notes.

262
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:38,800
For your report.

263
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,743
- It's okay. Photographic memory.
- Really?

264
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:50,077
What's that?
This is what we call a gas sniffer.

265
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,953
It's used to detect
the source of a leak.

266
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,618
Won't we smell it?

267
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,595
If the concentration's high enough,
we will.

268
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,062
Hold on a sec.
What?

269
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,761
You've got a little bit of soot right there.

270
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,270
Thank you.

271
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,804
I should take you on all my inspections.

272
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,973
Here, come on down.

273
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,616
Careful. You never know
what you might find down here.

274
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,553
Be careful.

275
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,626
Wait a minute. Here we go.
You see that?

276
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,792
What?
Right there.

277
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,294
- It's a leak?
- Yeah.

278
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,294
It sure is. Would you hold that?
Yeah.

279
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,962
Let me see that.

280
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:44,965
Yeah, see that?

281
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,748
There you go.

282
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,546
You know, it's a good thing
you contacted us.

283
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,781
We wouldn't have found this without you.

284
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:59,756
You're sure it's patched?
Yeah, it's fine.

285
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:03,721
Positive? I mean, there's no chance
this thing's gonna explode or anything?

286
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,252
No, it's fine.

287
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,430
Good. No fires here today.

288
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,696
Not in the building, anyway.

289
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,499
Listen, I'm off duty in 10 minutes.
You want to get some coffee?

290
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:24,307
I could give you the whole sordid history
of fire risk in prewar buildings.

291
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:28,078
- Actually, I'd like to, but....
- Boyfriend?

292
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,420
You know, let me get back to you
on that one.

293
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:39,130
My roommate really wants to meet you.
Maybe we could double this weekend.

294
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,928
Gina, I'm an associate professor.
I don't double.

295
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:49,500
All right. I'd love to meet your friends,
just don't drag me to a pep rally, all right?

296
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,801
I'll be right back.
I just have to use the ladies' room.

297
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,313
Tru?
Hi.

298
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,159
This is a....

299
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:12,127
- What are you doing here?
- Thought I'd surprise you.

300
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:16,031
We haven't had much quality time
on account of my job and all.

301
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,298
What, aren't you glad to see me?

302
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,498
Yeah, of course I am. It's....I'm surprised.

303
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,001
Where's the Dean?

304
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,345
Canceled. Pancreatitis.

305
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,181
Mark?

306
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:36,583
I'm sorry. I just wanted to come
and say hi to my favorite professor.

307
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,855
Yeah, this is Tru.

308
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:43,359
She was one of my star pupils.

309
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,886
Are you in his class now?

310
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:50,632
You'll learn a lot from him.
Things you don't expect.

311
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,761
Things you might not want to learn...

312
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,806
but he has a way of
making things very clear.

313
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,540
You must really miss his class.

314
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,840
I thought I would.

315
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:06,350
But I know now
that it's gonna miss me much more.

316
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,720
Anyway, I've taken enough
of the professor's time.

317
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,990
Goodbye, Mark. He's all yours.

318
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,495
Wait. Tru.

319
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:27,197
- You did that?
- It was amazing.

320
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:30,399
To have the chance to say
everything you want right in the moment.

321
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:31,476
God.

322
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,738
I could never do something like that.

323
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:38,249
You're so strong, Tru.
I really admire that about you.

324
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,880
And I'm sorry about Evans.
Not surprised, but sorry.

325
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:48,484
Cute.

326
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:52,122
So from now on, no more secrets, okay?

327
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:53,853
Okay.

328
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,365
Then there's something
I have to tell you, Lindsay.

329
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:04,307
- I think I met someone new.
- Already?

330
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,679
You little slut.

331
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:16,045
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

332
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:21,023
Did you know Mom's body
was sent to the morgue where I work?

333
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:24,255
No. But then again,
I was 10 when she died.

334
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,429
Come on, Tru. You gotta forget
about that stuff. You were a kid.

335
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,934
You gotta cut yourself some slack.

336
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:37,504
- How did you know that?
- Know what?

337
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:42,070
You knew that top was loose
before it even came off. Seriously.

338
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,841
Last week you knew about my cards,
and now this.

339
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,779
<i>Are you gonna teII me what's going on? </i>

340
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,748
I can't.
Why not?

341
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,086
- Because you won't understand.
- Me?

342
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,252
- Come on, Tru. How do you know that?
- I just do.

343
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:59,329
For the same reason I know
it's gonna rain at 3:00...

344
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:02,059
or that Patterson's gonna throw
a two- hitter for the Tigers.

345
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,431
Talk about answering a question
with a question.

346
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:07,404
<i>Honest, I just don't</i>
<i>get you sometimes, Tru. </i>

347
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,842
Is Patterson gonna throw a two- hitter?

348
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,708
I love that shirt, by the way.

349
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:19,773
Love this? I just pulled it out of the closet.

350
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,613
What?

351
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,751
- Nothing.
- No, what?

352
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,452
It's just nice to meet someone
who's not a jerk.

353
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,862
- Well, we're not all jerks.
- No, you're not.

354
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,925
So maybe you don't mind me
asking you how come you lied to me...

355
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,867
about being a student?

356
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,970
What makes you think I lied?

357
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,701
You're supposed to be
in your professor's office at 2:00...

358
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,208
with your report, and it's 2:15.

359
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,472
We did a good thing, right?
Stopping that leak?

360
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,913
Yeah, we did.

361
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:53,143
So let's just leave it at that.

362
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,880
Okay. Strange, but okay.

363
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,587
Do you like being a firefighter?

364
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,152
Yeah, I like helping people.

365
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,059
Don't you worry
about how dangerous your job is?

366
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,499
You see it on the news all the time.
A firefighter goes into a building and....

367
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,964
I don't really think about it.

368
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:15,573
Sometimes a job just chooses you.
You know what I mean?

369
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,673
Yeah, I do.

370
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,604
I mean you're good at it.
If we hadn't found that leak...

371
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,841
who knows what could've happened
this afternoon.

372
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,405
This afternoon?

373
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,417
You don't know who could've been killed.

374
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,009
Actually, I do.

375
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,015
No one.

376
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,149
What do you mean?

377
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:35,715
That wasn't anywhere near
the accumulation necessary...

378
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,455
to cause an explosion.

379
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:40,462
That leak wasn't dangerous?
In time, yeah.

380
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,796
A week,
two weeks down the line, maybe...

381
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:46,166
but that leak wasn't gonna
cause a fire today. Not a chance.

382
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,080
The type of fire
you're hypothetically describing...

383
00:26:56,181 --> 00:27:00,117
would be caused by dipping a cotton rag
in some sort of accelerant.

384
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:02,050
Like dimethyl benzene?

385
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,154
Why are you so interested
in discussing arson scenarios?

386
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:08,818
- Do you have a grudge against someone?
- I'm here to learn.

387
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:11,953
Dimethyl benzene
is found in cleaning solvents.

388
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:16,364
You soak a rag with the stuff,
put it next to a fuel source and kaboom.

389
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,095
The fibers you described...

390
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:22,037
would be seared into the skin of anyone
within proximity of the blast.

391
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:23,734
So this was arson.

392
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,633
Hypothetically.

393
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:30,879
Hypothetically, yes.
It's quick to ignite, it's hard to trace.

394
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:34,177
If you get it on your hands,
watch out, it's nasty burns.

395
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:37,983
I wasn't here for the last fire inspection.
I spent the night in the ER.

396
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,183
Thanks for your help, Davis.

397
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:45,787
If you ever need help with
other hypothetical research projects...

398
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:48,022
I'm always here...

399
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,996
and if I'm not here,
you can call my cell phone.

400
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:54,596
<i>We couId even maybe discuss it</i>
<i>over drinks or something. </i>

401
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,097
Do you have company?

402
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,904
Someone who's meeting me. A friend.

403
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:04,176
- His name's Nick Kelly.
- Mr. September?

404
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,784
It's for a good cause.

405
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,720
So you work here?

406
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,956
Sometimes a job chooses you.

407
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,559
Anyway, I'm thinking arson.

408
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:28,034
You said the gas leak
couldn't have started a fire today.

409
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:31,199
- That means it happened another way.
- What are you talking about?

410
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:34,335
- There's no fire at 84 Hastings.
- No.

411
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:36,506
Not yet.

412
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:41,283
I don't understand why you suspect
him for a fire that hasn't happened.

413
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,684
He was indicted for insurance fraud.

414
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:47,191
And you think he's planning
to burn down the building?

415
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,689
What's this about, Tru?
Why did you bring me here?

416
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,596
I believe 84 Hastings
may be a target for arson today.

417
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,964
If you have information
related to an arson...

418
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,936
you need to tell the police,
not run around like Nancy Drew.

419
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,768
- It's just a hunch.
- What kind of a hunch?

420
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,367
Listen, I'll make you a deal.

421
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,673
I'm listening.

422
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,410
Wait till tonight, and I'll tell you
anything you want to know.

423
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,281
And a whole lot more.

424
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:19,612
You're very lucky I have a soft spot
for strange women.

425
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:23,658
It's 3:30. I'll meet you back at your place
as soon as I can.

426
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:26,526
Grab a couple of beers,
order some Chinese...

427
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,692
and do not leave until I get there.
You promise?

428
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,099
Very, very strange.

429
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,243
Hello?

430
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,849
Is anybody down here?

431
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,235
Mr. Ford.

432
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,863
Let me guess. You lost an earring.

433
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,710
No. I'm here to tell you something.

434
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:15,740
What's that?

435
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,373
This building's being watched
by the police and fire departments.

436
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,009
They suspect a potential arson may occur.

437
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,316
Okay, I'll bite. Why?

438
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,355
You tell me.

439
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,618
Who the hell are you?

440
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:31,253
You were indicted for insurance fraud
two years ago.

441
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,490
- So what?
- How about taking that bandage off?

442
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,089
What the hell is this?

443
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,361
I'm just giving you a warning.

444
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,632
Don't talk to me like that, okay?

445
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:46,301
How was school, honey? Was it good?

446
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:47,503
Fine.

447
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:49,843
This is Samantha Block.

448
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:51,814
Died of smoke inhalation.

449
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:05,085
Come on, Samantha.
We don't talk to strangers.

450
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,857
Excuse me, ma'am?

451
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,365
Harrison, I can't talk right now.
I'm kind of putting out fires.

452
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:20,239
The Tigers won today, just like you said.

453
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:23,075
Glad I could help.
<i>I want some answers, Tru. </i>

454
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,843
- How did you know?
- I don't have time....

455
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,408
How much did you win?
<i>A IittIe probIem there. </i>

456
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:32,320
I would've won if I had the bucks.
So here's the way I see it.

457
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:35,248
To prevent future mishaps,
every morning...

458
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:38,659
<i>you and I, we get together, </i>
<i>we go over the game scores. </i>

459
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,699
<i>First we'II start with footbaII-- </i>
I gotta go.

460
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,755
Might indicate inhalation
of a chemical compound.

461
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,259
I'm guessing dimethyl benzene.

462
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:46,530
lndustrial uses, mainly.

463
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,854
Hi.
I heard a noise.

464
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,524
I'm Tru. I think we met earlier.

465
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,722
Yeah, I remember.

466
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:24,000
What do you say we get out of here?

467
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,263
Come on, I'll buy you a soda.

468
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,609
That little girl with you upstairs,
was that your sister?

469
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,645
Yeah.

470
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,877
- You don't sound too thrilled.
- She's okay.

471
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,148
This place sucks. My dad blew us off.

472
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,319
He lives in Washington
with some new wife.

473
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,755
Why'd you break into Mr. Ford's office?

474
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,825
It was an accident. I knocked too hard.

475
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:57,165
You could've just picked the lock.
It's a hundred years old.

476
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,203
Kevin, I need you to do me a favor.

477
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,534
But I need you
to not ask any questions, okay?

478
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,630
- What?
- When 5:00 rolls around...

479
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:06,837
make sure you, your sister, and your mom
are out of the building...

480
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:09,811
- and anyone else you can tell.
- Why?

481
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:14,451
- We said no questions, right?
- Okay. Done.

482
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,646
Cool. I'll be just a second.

483
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:19,616
Hello?

484
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:22,123
You're where?

485
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,559
Nick, I asked you to wait for me
at your apartment.

486
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,392
And I asked you for an explanation...

487
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,695
as to why you're trying
to put out nonexistent fires.

488
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:32,895
I mean, it's a beautiful day,
and I'm sitting in my apartment...

489
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:36,269
because some girl who works in a morgue
asked me to.

490
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,766
I think it's the super.
I told you...

491
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:43,244
- prior convictions aren't proof.
- His office was full of accelerants.

492
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,339
For equipment cleaning.
He's a building super.

493
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,008
There's something going on with him.

494
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,054
Even if there is, there is still no fire.

495
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:54,317
You can't arrest a guy
for thinking about doing something.

496
00:34:56,327 --> 00:35:00,161
Luckily, we can't be arrested
for our thoughts.

497
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:06,867
You think I'm insane, don't you?

498
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:11,005
Honestly? It's touch and go.

499
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,805
Look, maybe I'm doing this wrong,
I don't know.

500
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,677
- I just want to stop a fire.
- A fire that hasn't happened.

501
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:20,239
But it could.
How do you know?

502
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:21,682
I just do.

503
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:23,678
lntuition again?

504
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,953
I was right about the gas leak.

505
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,953
Look, you have to trust me.

506
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,665
That's the weird thing.

507
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,461
I do.

508
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,001
It's almost 5:00.

509
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:51,807
She's beautiful, and she tells time, too.

510
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,315
- No.
- What's wrong?

511
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,017
I can't right now.
Sure you can.

512
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,392
- No, I can't.
- We're here.

513
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:11,094
If I kiss you, I'll fall for you,
and I can't do that. That would be bad.

514
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:14,563
Why would that be so bad?

515
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:19,434
What?

516
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,703
Cotton fibers were plastered
on the epidermal layer.

517
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:25,873
It's red and something else.

518
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,850
That was a gift from your father.
I hate it.

519
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,046
- I was wrong.
- About what?

520
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,611
How it started. It's the kid.

521
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,088
What kid?

522
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:36,888
Kevin. The kid from the building.
He's gonna start the fire.

523
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,301
So some kid is gonna start a fire?

524
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,701
<i>A minute ago you said it was the super. </i>

525
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,137
He's angry.

526
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,371
Lonely. Feels invisible.

527
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,500
He could pick the lock
to the super's office.

528
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,806
What better way to get attention?
It makes sense.

529
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,380
To you maybe.

530
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,749
I have to get to that building.
That kid's sister is in trouble.

531
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:04,377
- Tru, I--
- Promise me you'll go home.

532
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,582
But if there's a fire--
No.

533
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:10,155
You're right. There's no fire.

534
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,720
<i>I'm wrong. Crazy, even. </i>

535
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:16,390
So then go home. Wait for me there.
Promise me, Nick.

536
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:20,495
- I'm tired of this game.
- Nick, please.

537
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,399
I like you.

538
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:26,067
I really do.
And I think you feel the same way.

539
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,611
- I'm not imagining this, am I?
- No.

540
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,313
- Then I need to know what--
- I told you...

541
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:32,906
you'll get all the answers tonight.

542
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:37,010
And before this day ends,
we'll have that kiss. But just go home.

543
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,121
Everybody, out of the building! Come on!

544
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,056
The building's on fire! Everybody, out!

545
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:51,631
You gotta get out, there's a fire!
Please, let's go!

546
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:55,597
Get out of the building!
Come on, you gotta get out! Please!

547
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,712
- What are you doing here?
- I followed you.

548
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,509
You promised!
I was worried!

549
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:07,642
You gotta get out of here right now!
Trust me! Come on!

550
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,322
- lntuition again?
- Let's go.

551
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,052
- No, I can't leave.
- Why not?

552
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,026
- I'm a fireman.
- You don't have your gear.

553
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:19,028
I rang the alarm.
They'll be here any minute.

554
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,587
Great. Traffic's gonna be jammed
clear downtown.

555
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,191
They're gonna be delayed by traffic.

556
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,497
That's why you went in.
You live down the block.

557
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,266
Listen. I want you to get out.
I'm gonna check upstairs.

558
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,864
No, Nick, wait!

559
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,750
Come here. I got you.

560
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:57,730
How about those Giants today?
That's seven in a row, my man.

561
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,962
Talk about really being on fire.

562
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,244
Nick!
Yeah, coming! Got a rescue!

563
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,546
The victim has a broken ankle.

564
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,049
- Nick, stop!
- What?

565
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,211
The floor's weak! Watch out!

566
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,384
How did you....Never mind.

567
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:31,765
My God!

568
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:45,005
See, I knew we'd have the kiss
before the day was over.

569
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,815
But Sam, she's supposed to be at the park.

570
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,849
My God. My daughter's still inside!
She's still in the building!

571
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,695
- Where are you going?
- I'm going after her.

572
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,595
She was hiding under the bed.

573
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:04,395
She's hiding under her bed.
But send someone else, please.

574
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,527
It's my job, Tru.
And I'm stubborn as you are.

575
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,299
Nick, no!
Listen to me.

576
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:09,896
I'll be down in a minute, okay?

577
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,565
Get this gear.
No, Nick!

578
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:15,042
No time, there's a little girl upstairs.
I know where she is.

579
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:27,786
Tru!

580
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:32,423
- I can't talk right now.
- You're crying.

581
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,486
Yes.

582
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:38,096
I know. It's been rough on both of us.
I get it.

583
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,059
No, you don't.

584
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,906
I wish that I could rewind
the day and have it back.

585
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,203
I would do everything differently.

586
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:49,040
I would show you
how much you mean to me.

587
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,209
You had your day.

588
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,677
You only get one.

589
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:17,071
I thought when you asked me for help,
it was for you.

590
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,773
Now I know it was for Samantha.

591
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:27,216
You saved her.

592
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:30,816
Everyone's calling you a hero.

593
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,860
I don't want to sound selfish...

594
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:42,388
but I wanted both of you.

595
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,232
You said your job
was a chance to help people.

596
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,504
All they have to do is ask.

597
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:00,079
So is mine.

598
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,812
So ask me, Nick.

599
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:07,517
Please?

600
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,788
I'm not leaving till you ask.

601
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,999
So please ask me, Nick.

602
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,165
Please, just ask.
