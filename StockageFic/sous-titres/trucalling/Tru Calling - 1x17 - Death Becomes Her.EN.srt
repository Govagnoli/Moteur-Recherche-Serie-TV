00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,333
<i>PreviousIy, on</i> Tru Calling:

2
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:03,561
Stay quiet now, Tru.

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,661
Where is your daughter?
She's not here.

4
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:06,796
Good.

5
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,738
This is Harper.
He'll be interviewing to replace Gardez.

6
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,869
And thanks for making me feel
so welcome.

7
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,379
It's never easy being the new guy.

8
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:15,675
That guy's going places.

9
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:18,240
Let's just hope
somewhere far, far away from here.

10
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:19,512
What's with your sister, anyway?

11
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,850
Ever since Mom died,
she looks over the family.

12
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:25,186
That's why she seems to have
the weight of the world on her shoulders.

13
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:26,520
There was someone else.

14
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:27,787
<i>It was your mother.</i>

15
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,192
What you can do...

16
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:30,729
she could do it, too.

17
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,146
It's the end of the line, Maggie.

18
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:54,311
Please, Nick. I promise
I won't tell anyone what I know.

19
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:56,755
You're right.

20
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,054
You won't.

21
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:16,706
See? That's her. That's her right there.
That's Carly Anders.

22
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:19,074
Right. It's the girl
from all those teen movies.

23
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:23,673
She put an album out, also, so....
And I care because?

24
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,514
Because she's gonna be
spending the day with us tomorrow.

25
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,612
Okay, remind me again
why some actress is coming here?

26
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,121
Because she's playing a morgue attendant
in her next movie...

27
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:37,061
she wants to make sure that she has
all the technical aspects of the role.

28
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,657
That's not what I meant. I don't get
why she's coming here, to our morgue.

29
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:41,927
A hometown girl.

30
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,128
<i>Her mom and eight- year- oId sister</i>
<i>Iive nearby.</i>

31
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:47,570
- Two birds with one stone, I guess.
- Okay.

32
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,099
Hey, what's this?

33
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,739
"Victim's sex, manner of death."

34
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:58,716
Well, it's personal data of everyone
that you've saved so far.

35
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,118
<i>I'm using it to Iook for recurring patterns</i>
<i>among wouId- be victims.</i>

36
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:06,750
So if a body comes into the morgue,
we'll know how likely it is to ask for help.

37
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:11,687
You know you're most likely to be asked
for help on Mondays and Thursdays...

38
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,725
that the killer is someone
that the victim is close to?

39
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,232
Does it say anything about my mother?

40
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,199
I'm not sure that I understand--

41
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,540
It say why she didn't tell me
about reliving days?

42
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,080
That she could do it, too?

43
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,207
I'm sure she would've,
but she ran out of time.

44
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,183
She must have known
there was some chance...

45
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,777
that she'd pass it on to her kids,
but never told us.

46
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,789
She never prepared us.
I mean, not one word.

47
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:38,983
I know that you're angry--

48
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:41,390
I just wish your research
could tell me that.

49
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:45,454
Not that I just won't be getting
any Mondays or Thursdays off for a while.

50
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,794
That's perfect.

51
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:50,825
'Cause I'll take all the Mondays I can get.
Big TV night for me.

52
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,662
- Is that the new schedule?
- No.

53
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:59,311
It's nothing. But I'll post the new schedule
in the morning.

54
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,838
Okay. Bye.

55
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:08,647
You know, Tru, I was thumbing
through the intake records this morning...

56
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:12,384
and I couldn't help but notice
you've never been on a pickup.

57
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,355
- That's ridiculous. I've--
- No, not one.

58
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:18,522
You're right. And that's my fault.
And I'm sorry.

59
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,928
And, Jack, thanks for pointing that out.
Thank you.

60
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,496
Any time.

61
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:34,405
All your pickups have been on relive days.
You remember?

62
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,675
It's like it never happened.
Do you think he heard us?

63
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,976
We so need a secret lair.

64
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,202
Help me.

65
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,619
$2, 200?

66
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:17,122
<i>PIease, sir, don't insuIt me, okay?</i>
<i>This is a hunk of junk.</i>

67
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,658
<i>What are you, out of your mind?</i>
<i>That's an insuIt.</i>

68
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,820
This vehicle's six years old,
has under 30, 000 miles?

69
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,863
<i>$2, 200 is a steaI.</i>

70
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,899
Yeah,"steal"
being the operative word.

71
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:31,798
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Got some brewing in the office.

72
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,804
Sorry, I just got off the night shift.

73
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,899
- Oh, really? Where do you work?
- I work over at the county--

74
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:41,074
Sidebar, you and me, right now.

75
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:48,683
What did we say about sharing
personal info with the used car guy?

76
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,717
Once they think you've got cash,
they jack up the price.

77
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,524
All I said was I work the night shift.

78
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,696
Look, just stick to the plan.

79
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,396
Talking to dead people, your thing.

80
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,560
- Haggling, mine.
- Fine.

81
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,300
Yeah, she'll give you $2, 000 for it, Monty.

82
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,173
Not a penny more.

83
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,138
Deal.

84
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,878
I'll start the paperwork.

85
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,440
Coffee, right?

86
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,315
Why do I feel he would've gone lower
than $2, 000?

87
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:26,017
Hey, at least you got a set of wheels now.

88
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:30,028
So you can do your girly stuff
and go save dead people.

89
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,587
All the things that you like to do.

90
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:36,829
I gotta go. Lindsay wants to prep me
for dinner with her sister tonight.

91
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,062
All right.

92
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,135
- Wish me luck.
- Luck.

93
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,036
Remember, celebrities
are just like you and me, only famous...

94
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,547
- so try to keep it cool.
- I'll try.

95
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,752
Hi, you must be Davis.

96
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:07,957
Tru Davies.

97
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,592
Carly Anders.
And this is my assistant, Anna.

98
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,771
Hi. Nice to meet you.

99
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:20,043
So, this is the Standards Room,
where a body gets processed.

100
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,206
After being picked up from a crime scene?

101
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,182
That's part of a morgue attendant's job,
to retrieve the body?

102
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,843
Typically, yeah.

103
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,613
But what if there isn't a body?

104
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:34,424
What if you get to a crime scene and it
looked like a murder had taken place...

105
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,486
but the body was gone?
Where are you going with this?

106
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,157
The reason I ask is that
in the first act of this movie...

107
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,997
my character issues a death
certificate for a guy who vanishes...

108
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,160
while hiking in the mountains.

109
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,864
You're wondering why you'd do that
if there wasn't a body?

110
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,032
Exactly.
Under certain circumstances...

111
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,373
a coroner's office can declare a person
legally dead without a body.

112
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,141
It's called
a certificate of presumptive death.

113
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:56,905
Let me ask you another question.

114
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,349
So how'd you get into this line of work?

115
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,014
Well, I had an internship lined up
to help me get into med school...

116
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,149
and when that fell through,
I kinda ended up here.

117
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,322
I used to want to be a doctor
when I was a kid.

118
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,494
But then the acting thing took off.

119
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,692
You know how it is when you find
your calling. You gotta answer it.

120
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,632
Yeah, I know what you mean.

121
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,239
But, judging by your success,
it seems you made the right choice.

122
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,704
I'm not so sure sometimes.

123
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:25,210
I mean, all the pressure, the hours,
putting up with the media...

124
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,279
it gets to you after a while.

125
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,582
Maybe I should work here.
Dead people are much less demanding.

126
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,845
Actually, you'd be surprised.

127
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,378
Look, I know this probably seems crazy...

128
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,825
but, Erin, she never likes my boyfriends,
and I really want her to like you.

129
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:44,852
- Relax. She's gonna love me.
- Well, she'd better.

130
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,525
We both know how spotty
your track record's been lately.

131
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,726
- Yeah.
- Look, I'm just....

132
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,235
I'm really counting on you, okay?

133
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,372
- Jackie, what's going on, man?
- Harrison.

134
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,302
Excuse me.

135
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,402
What is up?
How are you?

136
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,674
You at a funeral?

137
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:09,243
Yeah. A friend of mine passed away.
I came to pay my respects.

138
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:12,417
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah. Me, too.

139
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,050
Hi.

140
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:18,062
Jack, Lindsay. Lindsay, Jack.

141
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,223
Jack? Yeah, Harrison's told me
lots about you.

142
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:26,071
You know, I was about to go get a drink.
Would you guys like to join me?

143
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:30,006
I know it's early, but it's kinda been
one of those days, you know?

144
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,937
I actually have a ton of stuff to do
before tonight...

145
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:37,540
but if you think you can squeeze a drink in
before dinner, then....

146
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:41,144
Are you kidding?
Probably knock back three or four, huh?

147
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,880
But we won't.

148
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,949
She was really nice, Davis.
Totally down to earth.

149
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,588
Not at all what I expected.
Someone I could definitely hang with.

150
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,423
Yeah, if she wasn't going back
to Hollywood tomorrow.

151
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,992
It's not just that.
This whole superhero thing.

152
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:01,596
All the running around I do,
it's hard to keep the friends I have...

153
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,231
let alone make new ones.

154
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,902
Traditionally, superheroes
don't have many friends.

155
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,606
Just a close- knit group of allies
and confidants.

156
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:12,947
Well, I'm 22 years old, Davis.
I need more than allies and confidants.

157
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,856
- Hey. Can I help you?
- Yeah.

158
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,722
- I'm looking for Carly Anders.
- You just missed her.

159
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,227
Oh, shoot. I was really hoping
to catch up with her.

160
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:26,356
- Is she a friend of yours?
- We go way back.

161
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,962
You wouldn't know
where she was heading?

162
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,628
Her mom's, I think.
You could try her there.

163
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,227
Thanks, I will.

164
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,337
Well, Davis, I'll see you tomorrow.
It's been kind of a long day.

165
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:43,538
Tru, about your mother....

166
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:49,283
Maybe she never told you because she
didn't think you were ready to understand.

167
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,152
Well, I guess we'll never know, will we?

168
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:54,350
Bye.

169
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,075
Oh, no.

170
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,073
To new friends.

171
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,176
It's never easy
being the new guy in town.

172
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,949
I just wanted to say thanks
for making it not so hard.

173
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,354
Well, hey.

174
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,190
What's so funny, friend?

175
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:36,257
Just picturing your sister's face
when she finds out we hung out.

176
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,704
Yeah, don't take it personal.
You know Tru.

177
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,501
No, actually, I don't.

178
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:46,776
I mean, we work in the same place,
we talk every day, we work side by side...

179
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,573
but I can't really say I know her.

180
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,181
- Well, she's cool, bro.
- No doubt she is.

181
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:56,654
She's like me. Loyal.
But she is smart as hell.

182
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,820
And she works her tail off.

183
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,121
Tell me about it. She comes in off-shift...

184
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:04,162
practically memorizes the stats
of all the corpses.

185
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,762
That job, it's like she lives for it,
you know?

186
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,899
- Understatement of the year.
- What's that?

187
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,497
What's what?

188
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,405
Something about your sister
I should know?

189
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,069
What?

190
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,070
No.

191
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,047
<i>TaIk to me.</i>
Nice job.

192
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,021
- My car is a lemon.
- What?

193
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,524
It won't start.
Something's wrong with the engine.

194
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,025
We'll take it back in the morning.

195
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:39,224
Right. I'm sure Monty's Used Cars
has a real accommodating return policy.

196
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,458
<i>I'II figure something out,</i>
<i>I promise.</i>

197
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,934
- Look, right now, all I need is a ride home.
- A ride home?

198
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,932
Look, I'd love to help you out, Tru.

199
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,540
<i>But I gotta go home, get ready.</i>

200
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:52,509
If I don't look just right tonight,
Lindsay is gonna kill me.

201
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,672
- Whoa, you're kidding, right?
- Ask her where she is.

202
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,979
- Where are you?
- At the corner of Third and Ogden.

203
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,645
- Third and Ogden.
- Tell her I'll swing by the morgue...

204
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,621
and pick up the van,
be there in 20 minutes.

205
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,782
My man, Jack,
says he'll be there in 20 minutes.

206
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,349
Jack? No, I don't want a ride from Jack.

207
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:12,022
Babe, gift, horse, mouth. Need I say more?

208
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,866
So, you want to ride up front
or in the back?

209
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,571
Very funny.

210
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,142
Harrison sends his love, by the way.

211
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,805
Where were you two, anyway?
The racetrack?

212
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,008
- No, actually we were in a bar.
- Much better.

213
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,711
Why do I feel you don't want me
hanging out with your brother?

214
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,517
Probably because you're very perceptive.

215
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,749
- Harrison's a nice guy.
- Yeah, and I'd like to keep him that way.

216
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,091
A guy's gotta make friends somewhere.

217
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,824
What's that supposed to mean?

218
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,662
You think it's been easy for me
working in the morgue?

219
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:52,670
I try to be friendly, I try to be a good guy,
but every time I walk into a room...

220
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:57,004
you and Davis clam up,
or you change the subject, or you leave.

221
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,873
That has nothing to do with you.

222
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:03,347
Still, it doesn't exactly make me feel
like part of the team.

223
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:03,982
Jack, if we made you feel left out...

224
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,949
that's not at all what we're trying....

225
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:09,010
We would never want to....
Apology accepted.

226
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,288
Go for Jack.

227
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:16,058
Yeah? Yeah, I'll be right there.

228
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:20,463
Well, it's your lucky day, Davies.
You're about to go on your first pickup.

229
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,727
<i>Hop in.</i>

230
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:33,339
I mean, have you noticed this
crazy weather we've been having lately?

231
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,245
I remember it being much, much warmer
this time last year.

232
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,215
I know, isn't it the strangest thing?

233
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,845
I mean, it's late spring,
and I'm still in my midwinter wardrobe.

234
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,013
That is a lovely color on you, by the way.

235
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,450
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

236
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:52,253
Would you excuse me?
I'm just gonna powder my nose.

237
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,265
Yeah, sure.

238
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:00,529
You are doing awesome.

239
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,207
Come on, babe. What did you expect?

240
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,510
Don't answer that.

241
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:33,066
The deceased called 91 1 from her car
approximately 90 minutes ago.

242
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,902
Said she was being pursued by another
vehicle as she approached the bridge.

243
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,842
Then the line went dead.
Three guesses what happened next.

244
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,709
I'm gonna get the gurney. Be right back.

245
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,749
Okay. Do you think
she was forced off the road?

246
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:48,275
The divers found a red paint
scrape on the driver's side door.

247
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,947
Most likely from
the pursuing vehicle.

248
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,513
Who took her body out of the car?

249
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:55,856
She was already washed up on the shore
when we got here.

250
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,453
<i>MostIy IikeIy thrown free on impact.</i>

251
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,153
Jim.

252
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,710
Oh, no.

253
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,911
Carly.

254
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,450
Tru, I need your help.

255
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:36,495
$2, 200 for this hunk of junk?

256
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,059
What are you, out of your mind?
That's an insult.

257
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,368
Oh, boy. Here we go again.

258
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:54,443
$2, 200 is a steal.

259
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,215
"Steal" being
the operative word.

260
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,653
- I don't want it.
- Pardon?

261
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,816
I don't want it. I want....

262
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,118
I want that one.

263
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,265
- I thought I was doing the negotiating.
- Not today.

264
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:11,929
Little lady, I think you're mistaken.
This car is in"like new" condition.

265
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,733
<i>It's got at Ieast another 60, 000 miIes in it.</i>

266
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,308
It's got six miles in it,
and then it's gonna die.

267
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,604
And I'm not your little lady.

268
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,406
Did the day restart
so you could save a car?

269
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,714
I'll give you $1, 500 for that red one.

270
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:31,382
- It's listed at over $2, 000.
- $1, 500. Take it or leave it.

271
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:34,517
Deal.

272
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,418
Thanks, Monty.

273
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,562
The Carly Anders,
as in the one who's getting ready...

274
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,295
to come down the elevator?
Yeah.

275
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:48,999
I'm nervous around regular people,
but famous people that are about to die?

276
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:52,600
She's not gonna die, Davis.
Not if we have anything to say about it.

277
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,145
Who knew you would be asked
for help on Wednesdays?

278
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,272
Why wouldn't I be?

279
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,715
According to my research,
relived Wednesdays are a statistical rarity.

280
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,150
I was gonna make it your day off.

281
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,847
No more research.
Take it off your computer altogether.

282
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,686
Why?
Jack's been asking questions.

283
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,350
He thinks we're up to something.

284
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,257
We should be more careful,
don't you think?

285
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:13,059
- Well, what about suspects?
- There aren't any. Not yet anyway.

286
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:16,465
Find out what you can during the tour.
We need something to go on here.

287
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,627
Okay.

288
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,705
<i>And try to be cooI today.</i>

289
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,343
Hi. You must be Davis.

290
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,373
So, did you like the elevator?

291
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:35,250
What if, at the crime scene,
it looked like a murder had taken place...

292
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,548
but the body was gone?

293
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,021
Depending on the circumstances...

294
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,718
you'd issue a certificate
of presumptive death...

295
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,557
which allows the coroner
to declare a person legally dead...

296
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,358
- even if there's no body.
- Really?

297
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:49,231
Yeah. So, what's it like coming home
after striking it big? Is it weird?

298
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:52,395
Sure. But going home is always weird,
no matter who you are.

299
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,734
Yeah, but do you run into
any real jealous types?

300
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,536
- Here and there.
- Anyone who has any big issues with you?

301
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,873
Look, you seem like a real sweet person...

302
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,311
but I'd rather not talk
about my personal life.

303
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,473
Right. Of course. I was just wondering....

304
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:08,452
- Please, let's just stick to business, okay?
- Okay.

305
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,455
I was just gonna grab some lunch
from that diner up the street.

306
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,491
- Do you want anything?
- No, I'm good. Thanks.

307
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,787
Okay.

308
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,819
- Hey, Davis?
- Yeah?

309
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,387
Mind taking over?
I'm gonna run to the diner with Anna.

310
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,934
Yeah. Will you get me
a slice of chocolate....

311
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,526
I have a corn dog here, so it's fine.

312
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:27,730
Okay.

313
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:38,079
I've been with Carly for four years now.
Best boss I ever had.

314
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,608
- So you're pretty much with her 24/7, huh?
- More or less.

315
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,518
Then you'd know if there was someone...

316
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,614
who might be
holding a grudge against her?

317
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,056
A grudge?

318
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:51,392
Yeah. I mean, she got so famous, right?
Some people might resent that.

319
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,829
Everybody loves Carly.

320
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,161
So, you're saying you can't think of
one person who might feel otherwise?

321
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:02,229
The tabloids have a field day with her,
but Carly's tough.

322
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:05,268
One of the most determined people
I've ever met.

323
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:06,366
Really?

324
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:10,471
Her mom told me the only time
she ever took off was eight years ago...

325
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,483
right after a big movie.

326
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:16,612
She was 16 years old,
and on the verge of a nervous breakdown.

327
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:20,119
Finally, her mom forces her
to take a year off.

328
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:23,457
After that,
she comes back stronger than ever.

329
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,820
Wow.

330
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:34,631
Where's Carly?

331
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,799
That guy came in,
said he needed to talk to her.

332
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,878
I tried to stop him,
but she said it was okay.

333
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,912
He came looking for Carly yesterday,
but she'd left by the time he got here.

334
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,781
You heard anything they've been saying?

335
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,320
Been keeping their voices lowered.

336
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,583
I can't do this anymore!

337
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,881
I'll see you later, Carly.

338
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:56,826
Is everything okay?

339
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,920
Yeah, I'm fine.
That was just an old friend.

340
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:02,694
- Didn't look too friendly to me.
- Yeah? Well, it's nothing.

341
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:07,469
- Anyway, I should be going. Is Anna....
- Pulling the car around.

342
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,803
You sure you don't want
to stay a bit longer?

343
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,002
- I could autopsy something for you.
- No, thanks.

344
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,511
Nice meeting you.
Yeah, you, too.

345
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,010
You just gonna let her leave like that?

346
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:20,711
Don't worry, I'll be right behind her.
After all, I have to return this.

347
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,254
Did you steal her purse?
I had to do something.

348
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,620
- I needed to buy myself some more time.
- For what?

349
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:29,491
To figure out how I'm gonna tell her
she's gonna die tonight.

350
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:36,134
- Relax. She's gonna love me.
- Well, she'd better.

351
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,329
We both know how spotty
your track record's been lately.

352
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:40,700
- Yeah.
- Look, I'm just....

353
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,206
I'm really counting on you, okay?

354
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,867
- Jackie.
- Harrison.

355
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:49,470
So, you all ready
for Lindsay's big test tonight?

356
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,278
Oh, the test? No, no.

357
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,548
It's, you know, it's....

358
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,486
Dinner. Right.

359
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:01,890
You're a braver man than I am, Harrison.
But, hey, if I would've played it safe...

360
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,258
maybe I wouldn't be pushing 30
and all alone.

361
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,797
No, safe? No. It's....

362
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:11,096
Me and Lindsay? We click.

363
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,168
- You know what I'm saying, man?
- I stand corrected.

364
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,737
The truth is, I envy you, man.

365
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,145
You have what every guy wants...

366
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,737
whether he's man enough
to admit it or not.

367
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,986
To you and Lindsay.

368
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,614
Me and Lindsay.

369
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,430
You must be Carly's sister.

370
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:53,511
- Are you a reporter?
- No. My name's Tru.

371
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:56,103
- Swear you're not a reporter?
- Swear.

372
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,013
Oh, Tru.

373
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,923
Hey, your sister's adorable.
She looks just like you.

374
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,325
- How can I help you?
- You left this at the morgue.

375
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:13,159
- Wanted to return it before you left town.
- Thanks.

376
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:16,029
I wanted to talk about the guy
that came to the morgue today.

377
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,501
- Peter?
- Yeah, you two seemed pretty worked up.

378
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:21,504
- I don't see how that's your business.
- It's not, but....

379
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,541
- Listen, I'm worried about you.
- Why?

380
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,109
Because I have a bad feeling.

381
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,668
- So, what, you're psychic now?
- No.

382
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:31,010
Look, you've been asking
strange questions all day.

383
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,677
Thanks for dropping off my purse,
but you should go now.

384
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,777
If you're in trouble, maybe I can help.

385
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,980
I don't even know you.

386
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,114
No, not yet.
But if you just gave me a chance--

387
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,649
- We'd be the best of friends.
- Carly, please, I'm just....

388
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:46,789
Look, come near me or my family again,
and I'm calling the police.

389
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,038
Yo, thanks again, bro.
We should do this again sometime.

390
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,271
We should.
About what I said back in the bar....

391
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:01,369
No, don't worry about it.

392
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:04,074
No, I've just lost too many buddies
to wives and kids.

393
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,582
I don't want to lose another one.

394
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,517
You keep picking up that tab,
there ain't no chance of that.

395
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:09,986
All right.
Need a lift?

396
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,024
No, man. It's a nice day.
I'm gonna walk. Good luck tonight.

397
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,752
Thanks again, man.

398
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:27,060
Leave the key in the lock.
Step away from the car.

399
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,697
All right, buddy. Take it easy, man.

400
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,173
Take it easy, okay? Be cool. All right?
No problem.

401
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,040
Hang onto your keys, Harrison.

402
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:36,877
- No, you did not just say that.
- I'm afraid I did.

403
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:39,075
- Jack? Jack, just....
- Keys!

404
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,718
It's your car, not his.
Shut up!

405
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,847
When a guy with a gun asks for keys,
you hand the keys to him.

406
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,357
That's how it works.
Not this time.

407
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:51,021
The only way this guy's gonna get your car
is if you give it to him.

408
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,327
Because he certainly doesn't
have the stones to do it on his own.

409
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:59,268
If he did, we'd be dead already,
and he'd be nothing but a set of taillights.

410
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:04,035
- You sure about that?
- Oh, yeah.

411
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,622
Look, the car is a piece of crap, man.
It ain't worth it, okay?

412
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,719
Five seconds, your boy here's dead.

413
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,227
Jack, come on, man.

414
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,426
Five.

415
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,365
Come on, Jack.
It ain't worth it, Jack.

416
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,102
Four.

417
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,072
Come on, Jack! Hey!

418
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:41,111
Three.
Jack, man, come on!

419
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:42,942
- It's okay, Harrison.
- Two.

420
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,346
Let me give him the keys, man! Jack!

421
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,044
No!
One.

422
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,245
Bang.

423
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,336
What the hell was that, man?

424
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,811
This was a mistake.
She won't even talk to me now.

425
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,439
She just doesn't understand you.

426
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,211
<i>WeII, we were totaIIy cooI yesterday.</i>

427
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,582
And now, thanks to my gift,
she thinks I'm a psycho.

428
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,053
Which, to be completely honest,
I can't blame her.

429
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:28,115
- All that matters now is saving her life.
- Yeah, I know. It's just....

430
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,321
Sooner or later,
this gig is gonna cost me all my friends.

431
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:34,331
Tru, a hero's journey is treacherous.

432
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:38,130
Yeah, treachery I can deal with.
But being alone kinda sucks.

433
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:41,128
I'm guessing you weren't able
to find anything out...

434
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:44,675
- about the guy she was arguing with?
- No, just a name. Peter.

435
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:48,007
<i>Angry ex or something?</i>
Sounds about right.

436
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,639
- So, what's the plan now?
- Well, stick close to Carly...

437
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,945
and see what happens,
and pray she doesn't see me.

438
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,043
Why don't I meet you
and keep you company?

439
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,851
Davis, you don't have to do that.
<i>No, I want to, because....</i>

440
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,287
Tru, you're not alone.

441
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:07,021
- Thanks.
- I'll see you.

442
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:36,488
You okay?

443
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:41,494
- Do I look like a guy who's okay?
- You look like a guy who's still got his car.

444
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,397
Oh, my God.
What?

445
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,740
- He was gonna kill you, man.
- But he didn't.

446
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:54,401
Look, I am all about standing up
for what's yours.

447
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,775
But that was....

448
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:58,876
What, you got some kind of death wish?

449
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,511
Harrison, death isn't something
you have to wish for. It's coming anyway.

450
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,317
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

451
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,762
- Can I make a confession?
- Sure.

452
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,222
I lied to you...

453
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,160
before, when I said that an old friend
of mine had passed away.

454
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:23,367
I was at a funeral,
but I didn't know the person who died.

455
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:27,704
Did you go to the wrong church, what?

456
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:31,143
No. Just something I like to do.

457
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:35,250
- Go to strangers' funerals?
- Yeah.

458
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,345
- For what, kicks?
- No.

459
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,656
For clarity.

460
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,791
Right. Jeez.

461
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:49,628
I go to remind myself
that death is inevitable.

462
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:52,397
Death is part of life.

463
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,398
And as soon as you understand that,
you're free.

464
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,469
You can do anything you want.

465
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:08,484
So, is that what you meant earlier,
when you were you were talking about...

466
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,714
playing it safe with Lindsay?

467
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,051
Lindsay?

468
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,219
Look, I'm sure Lindsay's a great girl.

469
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,661
But the problem with great girls is,
they want great lives.

470
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,564
They want a house with
a white picket fence and 2. 5 kids...

471
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:23,692
playing in the yard.

472
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,326
I don't know you that well...

473
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,736
but you strike me as a guy
who wants more than that.

474
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,967
Who needs more than that.

475
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:35,078
More freedom. More fun.

476
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:37,811
More life.

477
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,747
Whoa, there's more here
than what I asked for.

478
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,382
Consider it a severance package.

479
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:24,428
That's not how our arrangement works.

480
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,494
You see, I ask you for money,
you get it to me...

481
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:30,432
whether it's today, tomorrow,
or a year from now.

482
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,493
I've honored that arrangement
for eight years.

483
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,367
I think that's long enough.

484
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:37,740
Not for me. I mean, I appreciate the bonus.

485
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:42,409
But you will be hearing from me again.
Count on it.

486
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,492
Why didn't you tell me
about your arrangement?

487
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:07,367
- And you are?
- Someone who cares about Carly.

488
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,064
She said you were an old friend...

489
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,142
but you look more
like an extortionist to me.

490
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,142
Actually, I'm a reporter for the <i>Sun- Times.</i>

491
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:16,078
What you just saw was an interview
for a story, nothing more.

492
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,274
She paid you off to keep quiet
about something...

493
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:21,284
- that happened eight years ago.
- I can neither confirm nor deny.

494
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:24,549
Look, what was it, Peter?
What happened back then?

495
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:32,086
Her mom told me the only time
she ever took off was eight years ago.

496
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,893
<i>Your sister's adorabIe.</i>
<i>She Iooks just Iike you.</i>

497
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,656
It's lsabelle.

498
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:41,063
She's not Carly's sister.
She's her daughter.

499
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,804
Whatever it is you're planning tonight,
you can forget it.

500
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,310
Because if you hurt Carly,
I'm going to the police.

501
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:49,471
Are you kidding?

502
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:52,015
Carly's little secret
helped pay for my summer home.

503
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:55,143
The last thing I'd ever do is hurt her.
Are we done here?

504
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:12,295
Carly's younger sister
is really her daughter?

505
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,704
<i>What a scandaI.</i>
<i>You don't think the reporter's the kiIIer?</i>

506
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,901
- No, Carly's worth too much to him alive.
- If not him, then who?

507
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,740
<i>I'm back at CarIy's</i>
<i>trying to figure that out.</i>

508
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,872
I can't believe you did that!
Look at it!

509
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,473
According to your spreadsheet,
there's a probability...

510
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,849
that the killer's someone
close to the victim?

511
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,480
Right.
Who's closer to Carly than Anna?

512
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,183
Just leave me alone.

513
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,737
Hey, what's up?

514
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:53,573
You were supposed to be here
two hours ago.

515
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:56,773
- Where the hell have you been?
- I lost track of time. No biggie.

516
00:31:56,848 --> 00:32:00,249
Actually, no, it is a biggie.
I told you that this was important to me.

517
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,683
Well, I'm here now.

518
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,712
- So, where's the big sis?
- She left.

519
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,920
Her loss, right?

520
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,722
Why are you acting like this?

521
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:14,663
I don't know.
Why are you acting so clingy?

522
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,026
What?

523
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:21,362
- Exactly what Jack was talking about.
- Jack?

524
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:25,235
What does he have to do with us, huh?

525
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,777
You know, sometimes I'm gonna be late.

526
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:30,439
Sometimes I might not show up at all.

527
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,506
That's just something
you're gonna have to deal with.

528
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,107
That's just something
you're gonna have to deal with.

529
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,210
No, I won't.

530
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,885
Because if you're feeling tied down...

531
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,858
then by all means,
consider yourself untied.

532
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,757
Whatever.

533
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,923
We're through.

534
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,564
Anna?

535
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,964
Tru, what are you doing here?

536
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:01,273
Carly had a few more questions
about the morgue, asked me to stop by.

537
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:04,042
- Is everything okay with you two?
- Honestly? No.

538
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,810
Why, what happened?

539
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:08,716
I asked Carly if I could borrow her car
to run some errands...

540
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:11,516
while she's at her mom's. She says fine.

541
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:15,049
I get in a fender- bender while I'm out,
and she throws a fit.

542
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:16,150
You were in an accident?

543
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:19,663
I was pulling out of a spot when
this other car just crunched the door...

544
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:23,861
and left a nasty red paint scrape.
But so what? It's just a rental.

545
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,234
Sorry.

546
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:30,631
Hello?

547
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,710
Good. You made it.

548
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,802
- Anna was in an accident in Carly's car.
- What?

549
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:38,177
A red car crashed
into the driver's side door.

550
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,547
If the damage was before
she drove to the bridge....

551
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:43,212
Maybe she wasn't forced off the road.

552
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:47,250
- Maybe she drove off the bridge herself.
- Suicide? No way.

553
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:50,726
The police said that Carly called 91 1
saying someone was following her.

554
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,025
Why would she do that
if she was planning suicide?

555
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:56,260
- Someone killed her, I know it.
- But who and why?

556
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:03,767
Carly.

557
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:31,130
But that can't be right.
It doesn't make any sense.

558
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:35,734
Fine. Yeah, I'll call you back
after I talk to her. Bye.

559
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:39,904
- Is everything okay?
- That was Carly's agent.

560
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:43,208
And according to him,
there is no morgue movie.

561
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:44,805
What?

562
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,146
The movie about the morgue attendant
doesn't exist.

563
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,686
Her next project's
supposed to be a romantic comedy.

564
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,245
If there's no movie,
why spend the day with me and Tru?

565
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,848
I was just wondering the same thing.

566
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:02,658
Hello?

567
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,258
Carly lied to us.
There never even was a morgue movie.

568
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,429
- What?
- It doesn't exist. She made it up.

569
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:12,067
Why would she come to the morgue?
Why would she ask us all those questions?

570
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,341
What if you get to a crime scene and
it looked like a murder had taken place...

571
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,314
but the body was gone?

572
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,584
Davis, this may sound crazy, but I think
she's trying to fake her own death.

573
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:26,686
- What did you say?
- Both days she asked what happens...

574
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,850
if I got to a crime scene
and there was no body.

575
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:32,589
She needs to be sure the missing person
would still be declared legally dead.

576
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,563
Why?
<i>Because that was her pIan.</i>

577
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:38,124
Fake her own death and disappear.
That's why she spent the day with us.

578
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:41,035
She wanted to get the details right,
so no one would catch on.

579
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,699
She had everything.
Why would she do something like that?

580
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,276
Think about what the last eight
years have been like for her.

581
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,505
<i>Knowing her secret</i>
<i>couId come out at any time.</i>

582
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:51,446
She must have had enough. Probably
thought this was the only way out.

583
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:54,952
If you're right, then Carly wasn't
forced off the bridge by another car.

584
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:57,316
<i>- And that caII to 91 1....</i>
- Also fake.

585
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:00,447
There's just one problem.
Carly didn't fake her death yesterday.

586
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:03,892
She actually died, otherwise the day
wouldn't have restarted.

587
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:07,021
Something must have gone wrong.
Something she didn't plan for.

588
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:11,592
Well, whatever that something is,
you have to get there before it happens.

589
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,311
Oh, my God.

590
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:41,527
I need help! You have to come
now! Someone's following me!

591
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,897
I can't get away! Please hurry!

592
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:49,001
What?
Carly, listen to me.

593
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:51,241
What are you even doing here?

594
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,641
I know what you're planning,
and it isn't gonna work.

595
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,679
It will, as long as you don't tell anyone.

596
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:59,341
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Please, just leave me alone.

597
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,748
Carly, I....

598
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,285
Watch out!

599
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,398
The SUV hit you yesterday.

600
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,728
That's how you got in the water.
That's how you died.

601
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:24,138
Died? What are you talking about?

602
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:27,344
I know why you did it, Carly.
I know about lsabelle...

603
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,709
- that she's your daughter.
- How?

604
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,548
I figured it out.

605
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:34,174
I thought that if word got out,
my career would be over.

606
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,880
So, you covered it up for eight years?

607
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,085
You don't know what it's like, Tru...

608
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:42,091
to have a secret
people are trying to expose.

609
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,093
Actually, I do.

610
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,721
Because I have a secret, too, you know.

611
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:50,358
There have been times
where I wanted to run away...

612
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,129
pretend it wasn't a part of me.

613
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,535
But I don't,
because there's someone's life at stake.

614
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,903
- Whose?
- Tonight it was yours.

615
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,179
Someday, someone
would have exposed us, I know that.

616
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:09,210
It's no way to live,
waking up each morning...

617
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,848
wondering if today's the day
the story finally comes out.

618
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,857
That's why I finally told lsabelle
the truth a few months ago.

619
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:19,828
That was the hardest thing
I ever had to do.

620
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:23,197
It took her some time,
but she's okay with it now.

621
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:25,292
She wants us to be together,
start a new life.

622
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:26,893
By faking your death?

623
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:31,305
Look, I'm leaving the country tonight,
and I'm taking lsabelle with me.

624
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:35,638
I didn't want to go to this extreme, Tru.
I tried to buy my way out today.

625
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,237
Pay off the one person
who knew the truth about lsabelle.

626
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:41,147
But he wasn't about to let the story die.

627
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,149
So I had to go to my backup plan.

628
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,155
If she's okay with you being her mother...

629
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:49,522
then why go to all this trouble?
Why not just come clean?

630
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:52,790
You think the tabloids
would ever leave her alone?

631
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,823
Ever let her have a life?

632
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:08,576
I'm sorry if you can't get away
from your secret, Tru.

633
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:15,218
But please, I need to get away from mine.

634
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:25,326
I thought you had that thing
with Lindsay and her sister.

635
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:29,662
I did, yeah. It didn't go exactly as planned.

636
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:34,802
She ended it.

637
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:37,430
I'm sorry to hear that.

638
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,101
I should've seen it coming, you know?

639
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:43,839
She gives me chance after chance,
and, you know, I screw up.

640
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:47,748
That's what I do. I screw up.

641
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:54,456
I know it must be hard,
losing a girl like Lindsay, but...

642
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,860
maybe it's for the best, you know?

643
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,858
I mean, all these chances
you keep talking about...

644
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:05,060
did it ever occur to you
that maybe they were chances for her?

645
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:08,196
Chances for her to change you?

646
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,372
Real friends don't do that, man.

647
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:15,070
Friends accept you for who you are...

648
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,579
appreciate you for who you are.

649
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,510
Yeah, I guess, you know?

650
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,075
No, don't guess, Harrison.

651
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:25,344
Know.

652
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:31,160
Now, I know I haven't known you
for very long, but I'm your friend, man.

653
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:34,487
No matter what.

654
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,928
- Duty calls. I'll see you soon, yeah?
- Thanks, man.

655
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:10,429
- Are you sure about this?
- Don't have to be.

656
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:13,428
I can't say it's my choice,
but it's Carly's life.

657
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,062
She can do what she wants.

658
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,767
Well, there's a lot of ways
to help people, I guess.

659
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:22,005
Some people need help living, some dying,
some a little bit of both.

660
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:27,713
I think I finally understand now.
She did it to protect her daughter.

661
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:31,248
Well, here's hoping
that Carly pulls it off.

662
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:35,486
Actually, I wasn't talking about her.
I was talking about my mother.

663
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:38,626
I don't get it.

664
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:41,290
Why would they call
and bring us all the way down here...

665
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,299
if there's no body to pick up?

666
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:46,427
Must've jumped the gun
when they found the car.

667
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:53,466
- Probably figured the body was still in it.
- The currents must have washed it away.

668
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:55,741
We may never find it.

669
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:01,584
I'll see you two back at the office.

670
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,121
It's too bad.

671
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,019
Your first pickup and no body.

672
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:10,124
Go figure.

673
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,965
Poor Carly Anders.
She had a lot to live for.

674
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,666
It's funny how life works, huh?

675
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:25,334
One day you're here,
the next day you're not.

676
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,813
Well, wherever she is tonight...

677
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:37,981
I'm sure it's a better place.

678
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:47,458
Hey, Mom.

679
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:05,748
I know it's been a while,
but I've been busy.

680
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:11,152
I guess nobody would understand that
better than you.

681
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:16,019
But I'll be back soon, Mom.

682
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,991
I promise.
