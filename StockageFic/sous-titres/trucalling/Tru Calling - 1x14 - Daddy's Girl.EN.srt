1
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:03,562
Hurry.

2
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:06,839
Tru, come on.

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,273
What's wrong, Mommy?

4
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,274
Come on, sweetie.

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,141
Is everything okay?
Shh!

6
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,488
Stay quiet now, Tru.

7
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,772
Are you alone?

8
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,546
Yes.

9
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,789
Where's your daughter?

10
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,016
She's not here.

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,052
Good.

12
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:15,970
I see Mom's face.

13
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,906
And then I hear it.

14
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,076
A man's voice and....

15
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,772
It's'cause Daddy's coming to town.

16
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:28,114
- The dream has nothing to do with Dad.
- Right.

17
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,952
Besides, Meredith says
he's only in town for a conference...

18
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,015
so the odds are
we won't even hear from him.

19
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,220
But there's something else.

20
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,453
And that is?

21
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,599
What I do...

22
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:45,603
going back, trying to save
these people from dying...

23
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,703
I think Mom could do it, too.

24
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,575
Where did you get this?
Davis.

25
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,906
He was an assistant
the night they brought Mom in.

26
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:01,385
How does this freak- fest from a morgue...

27
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,979
become such an expert on our mother?

28
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,451
He talked to people, did research.

29
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:10,292
Besides, the question isn't how he knows,
but if he's right.

30
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,360
And if he is...

31
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,501
what am I going to find out next?

32
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,209
Help me.

33
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,579
There's this new technology
everybody's talking about.

34
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,443
It's called a bed.

35
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:06,877
Sorry.
I haven't been sleeping very well lately.

36
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,922
Your shift's over. Why don't you go home
and get some real rest?

37
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,718
How"over"?

38
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,225
I'm meeting Harrison and Meredith
at the diner in three minutes.

39
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,697
Rumor has it our father's in town.
This is Meredith's way of dealing.

40
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,859
Your father?
Yeah.

41
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,436
Just because none of us
has seen him in five years...

42
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:27,405
doesn't mean he still can't make us crazy.

43
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,013
So, you want to talk
about our father, right?

44
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:38,778
Actually, I was going to see
who wants to split the French toast.

45
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,614
Here you go.
Expecting someone?

46
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,021
Right. About that.

47
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:49,088
Well, you asked if I had anything
to say about Dad...

48
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,427
and so I brought someone...

49
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,966
who I thought could say it better.

50
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,630
His wife.

51
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:58,799
Jordan.

52
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,676
Well, it ain't breakfast, it's an ambush.

53
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,836
Don't blame Mere. This was my idea.

54
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:12,413
Anyway, I'm sure you all remember
this weekend is your father's birthday.

55
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,112
<i>And since he's in town for a conference...</i>

56
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,419
I convinced him
to let me throw him a party.

57
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:19,981
- Yeah.
- Here in his hometown.

58
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:23,995
And I thought
what could be more special for Richard...

59
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,054
than to spend his birthday with his kids?

60
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:29,761
- From which marriage?
- Harry, she's trying. Why can't you?

61
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,663
It's just a small get- together.
I work nights.

62
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:38,341
Well, they let you out to eat, don't they?

63
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,408
Just come tonight.

64
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:46,579
lsn't showing up the least you can do?

65
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:51,948
Funny, I thought the same thing
about my dad my last 10 birthdays.

66
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,225
Tru, I'm sorry, that's not--
For what?

67
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:59,129
For breaking up my parents' marriage,
or pretending it never happened?

68
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,257
You know, I just remembered
I got to be somewhere.

69
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,356
Tru.

70
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:12,835
You wouldn't believe it, but we get some
pretty questionable job applicants.

71
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,142
But you, on the other hand...

72
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,873
good school, six years of EMT experience.
This is pretty good.

73
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:23,615
- Some would say that you're overqualified.
- Some might say I'm late paying my rent.

74
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,285
Yeah.

75
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:32,021
Look, the reason I'm here is because
they say this is a decent place to work...

76
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,965
reasonable on- call hours, steady turnover.

77
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,704
Well, you have done your homework.

78
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:42,571
I do have some other candidates
coming in...

79
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:46,245
- but I'll show you around the place.
- Great.

80
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,677
So, this is the sign- in room.

81
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,841
The hub of most of the activity.

82
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,147
Not today, obviously, but....
Right.

83
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,957
Do you guys use LFD
as your primary filing system?

84
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,220
Yeah.

85
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,660
Slow week.

86
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,591
Probably a good thing in our business.

87
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,531
You mind if I take something to drink
before I hit the road?

88
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,503
- No, not at all. It's right there.
- Thanks.

89
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:16,869
Perfect timing.

90
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,309
<i>Odd and compIeteIy off scheduIe,</i>
<i>but perfect.</i>

91
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,347
I forgot these
when I took off this morning.

92
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:25,942
This is Mr. Harper.
He will be interviewing to replace Gardez.

93
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,277
Hey. Jack.

94
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,855
Hey. Tru.

95
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,417
You had to write it down?

96
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:38,794
Just so the functional illiterate
wouldn't drink my soda.

97
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,059
Right.

98
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,191
Can't be too careful...

99
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:46,705
what with the big soda shortage
I've been reading so much about.

100
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,469
And here I was thinking you didn't read.

101
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,280
Okay, you know what? I'll probably
make my decision by this afternoon.

102
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,543
Great.

103
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:01,309
Well, you know where to find me.

104
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:03,984
Excuse me.

105
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,684
Thanks.

106
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,756
That guy's going places.
Yeah.

107
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,802
Let's just hope
somewhere far, far away from here.

108
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,530
Are you all right?

109
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,432
Fine. I just don't get why
you'd want to hire someone like that.

110
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,340
I know you have a lot on your mind,
but are you sure...

111
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,971
that it's Jack that's bothering you?

112
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,455
Hey, Claire.

113
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,123
It's Tru.

114
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,296
- I know who you are.
- It's been a while, I wasn't sure.

115
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:49,228
Anyway, I'm looking for Jordan,
your mom.

116
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,496
She's not here.
Do you want to talk to my daddy?

117
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,504
- No, that's okay.
- Dad.

118
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:54,665
Yeah?

119
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,278
Tru.

120
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:01,975
Hi, Dad.

121
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,075
It's good to....

122
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:09,150
I was sure you'd be at your conference.
I was actually just looking for Jordan.

123
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,988
Claire, do me a favor.
Go keep an eye on your brother, will you?

124
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,391
Come in. Or are you in a hurry?

125
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,657
Jordan's actually running errands.

126
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:28,373
But she'll be at the party tonight.
Can it wait until then?

127
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:31,272
I don't know if I'll be able to make it.

128
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,944
You know, work.

129
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,674
Right.

130
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,280
Jordan told me
about your breakfast this morning.

131
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,412
And it will mean a lot to her
that you came here to apologize.

132
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,251
Apologize? No.

133
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,655
I might have been a little out of line.
I was upset.

134
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,921
With Jordan or with me?

135
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,399
I should go.

136
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,971
Come tonight, okay?
If I can.

137
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,708
Look at you.

138
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,713
You are so much like your mother.

139
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,415
It was your mother.

140
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,184
What you can do, she could do, too.

141
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,265
Jordan, it's me again.
I don't know if you're still out...

142
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:38,138
or if you even have your cell phone
with you. Should I worry?

143
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,336
Call me.

144
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,368
<i>Thanks.</i>

145
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:49,412
- Thought I'd make an appearance.
- I'm glad you did.

146
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,384
I can only stay for a minute.

147
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:54,051
Where's Jordan?
I'd still like to have that conversation.

148
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:57,789
Running late, as usual. She was supposed
to meet me here after her errands.

149
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:58,921
Typical Jordan.

150
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:02,229
I'm sure she's just out
getting you a last- minute gift.

151
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,393
Yeah.

152
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:06,865
Come on.

153
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,572
Look who's here.

154
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,744
Come on.

155
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,380
Harrison.

156
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,375
Hi.

157
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:26,981
I want to introduce you
to my lovely girl, Lindsay.

158
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,653
- Hi, Mr. Davies.
- You're Tru's friend from school, right?

159
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:30,753
Yep.

160
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:35,290
I don't think Harrison has ever formally
introduced me to anybody he's seeing.

161
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,167
It wasn't really necessary before.

162
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:44,706
- Lindsay, let's go get drinks.
- Yeah. It was good to see you again.

163
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,212
Seems like a nice girl, Lindsay.

164
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,183
- And here it comes.
- Don't get defensive.

165
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,416
I look at you,
and you've got so many options.

166
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,256
Why limit yourself?

167
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,091
Usually you save the advice
for the occasional Christmas card.

168
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,157
Don't waste
all your good material tonight.

169
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:13,295
What I'm trying to say, if you'll
let me finish, is that you're doing fine.

170
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:17,037
Just don't let this thing
with Lindsay confine you.

171
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,600
You're young. Keep your eyes open...

172
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,606
for what might otherwise pass you by.

173
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,148
Well, just so you know...

174
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:32,351
it's kind of a now thing. It's no big deal.

175
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,003
Good to know where we stand.

176
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,679
Hello.
Hi.

177
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,512
How was the party?
A bust.

178
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:08,048
The only reason I went was to apologize
to Jordan, who never showed up.

179
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:11,221
Listen, about your mother.

180
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,458
- I just wanted to say that--
- It's okay.

181
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:16,524
I think I've had enough
big conversations for one day.

182
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,962
So how about the new guy?
When does he start, Mr. Mooch?

183
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,666
He doesn't.
I checked his references and....

184
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,037
He didn't check out?

185
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,670
No. It turns out that Mr. Harper
has a nasty habit...

186
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,907
of not showing up for work. Permanently.

187
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:32,382
Until I called, his last three
employers had no idea where he was.

188
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,682
You're kidding.
So it looks like it's just you and me.

189
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,986
Who brought this one in?
Copland from County.

190
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,356
He's helping me
until I find a replacement.

191
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,623
Must've dropped it off
when I was on break.

192
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:47,962
It looks like a mugging.
It's multiple stab wounds.

193
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,695
Oh, God.

194
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:54,866
Jordan.

195
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,125
Dad, I'm....

196
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,125
I know.

197
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:27,064
You probably don't remember this,
but when your mother....

198
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,540
This is where we....

199
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:37,472
We could have her moved somewhere else
if it would make it easier.

200
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,184
It's my fault.

201
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,230
I shouldn't have let her go.
There's nothing you could've done.

202
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,563
Mugged.

203
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,432
God, if I could just have it
to do over again.

204
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,709
You should talk to them.

205
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,749
I will.

206
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:24,827
You know, there are pieces I remember
from the night Mom died.

207
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:28,956
<i>Things I wish I didn't.</i>
<i>And they don't have to be here.</i>

208
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,966
We're ready for you.
I'll keep an eye on the little ones.

209
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,116
It's all right. I'll do this.

210
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,322
<i>You can wait out here.</i>

211
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,390
Let Daddy handle it.

212
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,246
All right.

213
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,517
Now what?
I'll take it from here.

214
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,522
- You sure you can....
- It's my job.

215
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:03,822
Yours is to be with your children.
They're going to need their father.

216
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:52,373
What are you doing? Go home.
I'll cover this. I'm serious.

217
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:57,239
No one's giving out extra credit
for the bravest girl in the room.

218
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,719
Go on. Go home.

219
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:10,825
You cannot save everyone. Go.

220
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,672
Victim suffered multiple stab wounds
to the upper torso.

221
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,229
<i>Tru.</i>
What?

222
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,573
I didn't say anything to you.

223
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,444
<i>Sex: FemaIe.</i>

224
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,008
<i>Tru.</i>

225
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,817
Stop him.

226
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:47,991
My God, Davis, I'm so sorry.

227
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,298
The coffee's just really hot.

228
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,702
This is the third time this week
you've crashed out during your shift.

229
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,001
Why don't you--
Can't.

230
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,407
I've told you about my father's wife,
Jordan, right?

231
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,571
She's in town and sometime today,
she's going to be murdered.

232
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,939
- One of those days again.
- And about the Jack guy...

233
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,509
check his references before the interview
so you don't get your hopes up.

234
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,817
Okay. Where are you going now?

235
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:15,084
Believe it or not, I'm going to
spend the day with my stepmother.

236
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,157
Tru?

237
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,664
Jordan, hi. This is unexpected.

238
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,066
She wanted to see us
to talk about some things and--

239
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,438
That's funny,
because I was just telling someone...

240
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,638
how I thought it was time
you and I got to know each other better.

241
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,511
You were?
I would like that, Tru.

242
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:41,443
Which makes what I came to ask you
much easier.

243
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:45,182
Your father's birthday is this weekend
and I'm throwing a party for him.

244
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,747
I'll be there.

245
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,387
You said she'd probably walk out on me.

246
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,692
I'm thrilled, Tru. Thank you.

247
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,664
Excuse me, I'm going to wash up.

248
00:18:57,035 --> 00:19:00,869
Okay, what's going on? Those are the first
polite words you've ever said to her.

249
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,407
I guess we're all full of surprises today.

250
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,636
Hey, kids. What's cracking?

251
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:11,714
Jordan came by and told us she's throwing
a party for Dad tonight, and Tru--

252
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:15,446
- Told her off?
- Actually, Tru said she'd be there.

253
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,386
She was killed? Come on, get out of here.

254
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,624
Why else do you think I'd hang out
with her? I don't have a choice.

255
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,530
She was killed, she asked for my help,
the day rewound...

256
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,034
and I'm stuck with her for the entire day.

257
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:34,503
We're going to go pick up Dad's cake.
I guess we'll see you guys later?

258
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,542
Mind if I come along?
You know, help with the party planning?

259
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,406
Of course. That'd be nice.

260
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:43,471
What do you know?
Could you excuse us for just one sec?

261
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,379
You can't tell me something like that
and just run off to some bakery.

262
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,286
- Do you need me to do something?
- I don't think so, not yet.

263
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,381
But when Dad asks you
about Lindsay tonight...

264
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,983
tell him how you really feel,
not what he wants to hear.

265
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,256
You'll be glad you did. Okay?

266
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,764
My office. I'll be right back.

267
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,640
So, Jordan, where to after this?

268
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,973
Back to the hotel
or you may be meeting someone else?

269
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,946
It depends on how much time I have.

270
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:19,040
What kind of cake do you think
he's going to want this year?

271
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,778
Honestly, you've got the wrong girl...

272
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,912
if you're looking for intimate knowledge
of Richard Davies.

273
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,082
Then we have something in common.

274
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,251
What do you mean by that?

275
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,492
Tru, I love your father.

276
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,032
And I might even understand him.

277
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,567
But that doesn't necessarily mean
that I know him.

278
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,376
I think that he only ever let
one person in completely...

279
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,802
and that was your mother.

280
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:53,309
So the rest of us,
we just take what we can get.

281
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,511
Can I help you?

282
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,524
We'll take the big chocolate one.
Sure thing.

283
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:08,926
I see the bulk of your work
experience has been as an EMT.

284
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,128
Why the sudden desire
to change teams?

285
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:15,730
The truth is, I think I'd accomplished
everything I wanted to in that line of work.

286
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,810
I contacted all your previous employers...

287
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:22,608
and they all said the same thing,
that you were good at the job...

288
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,013
but one day you didn't show up.

289
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,710
Just disappeared.

290
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,388
Is there anything you want to say
about that?

291
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,188
A couple of years ago...

292
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,090
I died.

293
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:40,896
Excuse me?

294
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:45,601
I was at a scene working on a kid
about nine years old.

295
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,599
He had a gunshot to the back.

296
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,466
We'd just gotten a pulse...

297
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:55,008
and I guess someone didn't want the kid
to make it.

298
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,843
He started firing.

299
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,613
I caught the bullets instead.

300
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,619
I remember...

301
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,720
it felt like a bee sting
on the back of my neck, right here.

302
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:13,062
Three minutes and 28 seconds.
That's how long my heart stopped.

303
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,695
And then, I came back.

304
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,737
And what was that like?

305
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,137
You know, they say an experience
like that changes you.

306
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,871
It should make you want to live every day
to the fullest.

307
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,080
But for me, it just....

308
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:33,716
I lost it.

309
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,886
I knew something had to give.
It just didn't feel right....

310
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:46,997
It just didn't feel right
entrusting lives to my unsteady hands.

311
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:54,231
I thought a change of location would help.
It didn't.

312
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,701
I'm hoping a change of vocation will.

313
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:03,379
Some would say once you survive
something like that...

314
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:06,280
that you were brought back for a reason.

315
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,316
I guess we'll see.

316
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,591
I love cutting through the park.

317
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:20,062
If it stays like this,
it may be nice living here.

318
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,191
Are you sure
you don't want to just take a cab?

319
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:23,700
I know you have a lot to do today.

320
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,827
No, we're just going a few blocks.

321
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:32,439
I just want to let you know I really
appreciate you giving me a chance today.

322
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:41,418
You know,
your father and I don't fight very often...

323
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:45,980
but when we do, it's usually about
his relationship with the three of you.

324
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,217
Really?

325
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:51,990
For what it's worth,
I think his distance comes from guilt.

326
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,392
About how he dealt with what happened.

327
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,770
But he's different now.

328
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,639
He wants to make things right.
He's changed.

329
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,381
He's a different man, Tru.
Jordan, go!

330
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,007
Now we know why we left the city.

331
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:43,047
They can talk all they want
about the shrinking crime rate.

332
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:47,073
You know, I think I'm going to lie down
a bit, before the party.

333
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,619
Close my eyes.

334
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:49,676
Hey.

335
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,355
Thank you.

336
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:57,088
<i>Who knows what couId've happened</i>
<i>if you hadn't been there?</i>

337
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,722
- I'm just glad you're okay.
- Thanks.

338
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:05,360
Boy, never a dull moment.

339
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:09,062
If not the little ones, it's Jordan.

340
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,507
- Luckily, she's fine.
- Luckily, you were with her.

341
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,873
She's sweet, Dad.
I probably should've noticed that sooner.

342
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:19,941
I'd probably better get going--

343
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,748
It's nice that you stopped blaming her.

344
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,856
Blame her? For what?

345
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,787
Me and your mother.

346
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:33,887
Look, Dad, I'm glad that I could
help Jordan, but now is not the time.

347
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:37,230
No, it's not the time.
It's long overdue. Sit down.

348
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:46,709
When I met Jordan, yes,
your mother and I were still married.

349
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,245
I'm pretty clear on that part.

350
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:51,248
But we had already decided
to get a divorce.

351
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,543
What?

352
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,118
Why didn't I know this before?

353
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,517
Because you didn't want to.

354
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:07,122
I loved your mother, Tru,
but the fact is...

355
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,563
we grew apart.

356
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:15,231
She became distant, unreliable.
She'd run off at a moment's notice...

357
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:20,875
at very odd hours, flimsy excuses.
It was like she was living some....

358
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,645
Secret life.

359
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:31,378
The truth is, when I met Jordan,
I'd been alone for years.

360
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,363
But I've said enough.

361
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,464
Too much, probably.

362
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:47,436
Today is not a day
for living in the past.

363
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:51,171
<i>I'II see you tonight, won't I?</i>

364
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:02,109
It would mean the world to Jordan
if you would make an appearance.

365
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:06,850
And it would to me, as well.

366
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:29,140
- Hey, you made it.
- I did.

367
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,114
- Hi, you look beautiful.
- So do you.

368
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:34,674
Please, I stopped looking beautiful
two children ago.

369
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:38,313
So, this is Tru. Richard's daughter.
The one I told you about.

370
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,722
Jordan's been singing your praises
all night.

371
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:44,055
So, if you'll excuse us,
I have a lot of people I want you to meet.

372
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,460
Come here.

373
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,235
Harrison.

374
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,244
Dad.

375
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,880
I want to introduce you
to my girl, Lindsay.

376
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,408
- Mr. Davies.
- Aren't you Tru's friend from school?

377
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:10,579
Yeah.

378
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,819
There's Tru. It was nice to see you again.

379
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,996
She seems like a nice girl.

380
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,228
She is.

381
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:28,063
One of the nicest ones I've met
in a long time.

382
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,975
That's good to hear.
But at your age, Harrison--

383
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,273
Yeah, at my age, you met Mom.

384
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:38,013
Now you wouldn't consider that a mistake,
would you?

385
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:40,882
No, absolutely not.

386
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,978
Think about it.
You have three wonderful kids.

387
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,723
If you haven't noticed.

388
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,960
Yeah, I see your point.

389
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:05,065
God, you are so unexpected sometimes.

390
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,284
Dad?
What?

391
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,114
- He's here.
- Who? What are you talking about?

392
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,589
The man from the park
who attacked Jordan. He's here.

393
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:54,886
Or at least he was.

394
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,426
He's here now?

395
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:59,156
That means it wasn't random.
He's looking for her.

396
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:03,257
I'm going to call the police.
Don't let Jordan out of your sight.

397
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,535
Excuse me.

398
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,400
You...

399
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,334
what do you want with her?

400
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,709
The daughter's always the last to know.

401
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,713
Where's your daughter?

402
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:57,979
It was you. You killed my mother.

403
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,558
What do you want from us?

404
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,858
What's up?

405
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,922
Dad said something was going down
with Jordan.

406
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,594
- He was here.
- The man who mugged Jordan is here?

407
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,899
- The man who killed Mom.
- What?

408
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:15,901
It's the same person.

409
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:20,541
Go find Jordan, make sure she's okay.
Harrison, go. Hurry up!

410
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,655
You've gone way too far
this time.

411
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:35,381
I told you the last time,
this is over. You understand?

412
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:38,924
I never want to see you again.

413
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,577
Tru!

414
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:09,418
Wait.

415
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,596
- Will you give me a chance to explain?
- You knew him.

416
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,133
This is not what you think.

417
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,192
You don't want to know
what I think right now.

418
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:24,064
Yeah, I know him. He's an ex- con,
and his name is Carl Neesan.

419
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,539
- And you know that because?
- I was the one who convicted him.

420
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:33,875
I was an ADA 15 years ago.
He was a kid up on a murder rap.

421
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,978
He said he was innocent,
which they all do.

422
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:41,924
The evidence was flimsy, but I was out
to impress, so I went after him.

423
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,720
And was he guilty?

424
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:48,359
The jury said he was.
That was good enough for me.

425
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:53,231
At the sentencing, he swore revenge...

426
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,762
and he said if he ever got out,
he would make me pay.

427
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,573
Why today?

428
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,874
Why today, of all days, does he show up?

429
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,848
You think this is the first time?
This has been going on for years.

430
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:09,478
He shows up, he demands money.
He threatens retribution, so I pay him...

431
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,682
and he goes away. Until the next time.

432
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:15,124
And today?

433
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:19,393
Today I told him it had to stop.

434
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,430
I wasn't going to pay.

435
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:25,328
I never thought that he would
follow through with his threat.

436
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:28,895
God, I never wanted to get you involved
in this. Not you, not Jordan.

437
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,668
And what about Mom?

438
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:37,847
What does your mother
have to do with this?

439
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:39,907
He killed her.

440
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:42,680
- He killed Mom.
- Why would you say that?

441
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,454
I was there.

442
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:50,620
- No, sweetheart--
- I heard his voice.

443
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,863
I will never forget that voice.

444
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,866
He killed Mom because he was angry
with you. He wanted revenge.

445
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,026
Tru, no.

446
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:01,265
Don't tell me no, I saw him.
I was there, I saw him pull the trigger.

447
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,498
That's not what happened.

448
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:05,371
- How can you tell? He said he--
- It's not!

449
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,610
You don't think his was the first name
I thought of?

450
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:17,017
The police investigated this
thoroughly, and said this was not the man.

451
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,178
Airtight alibi.

452
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:24,852
"Not your man, Mr. Davies."

453
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,666
But I heard his voice.

454
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,961
But did you see his face?

455
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:38,666
No.

456
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,153
We live with the question long enough,
we want an answer.

457
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:03,699
So our mind plays tricks on us
and makes us think we've got one.

458
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:06,469
But we don't.

459
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:14,835
- Come on, it's cold. Let's go inside.
- No, I can't. I've got to go to work.

460
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,339
- Tonight?
- They're expecting me. I should go.

461
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:31,994
Happy birthday, Daddy.

462
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,519
Don't you think
you've been through enough?

463
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:00,384
Why don't you go home
and get some sleep?

464
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,886
Sleep. That's a novel concept.

465
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:09,860
If Neesan didn't kill my mother,
then is it true?

466
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:11,628
What?

467
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:16,437
That her death had something to do
with her calling.

468
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,675
Despite what you might think...

469
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,842
I don't have all the answers.

470
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:27,614
But I'll promise you this,
I'll help you find them.

471
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,043
Thanks, Davis.

472
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,886
But for now, I'm going to take you up
on your first offer.

473
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:37,792
I'm going to go home, draw a bath,
and try and get some sleep.

474
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:42,159
I guess you didn't hire Jack after all.

475
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:44,360
Actually, I did.
I decided to go with my gut.

476
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,426
- That's weird.
- What's that?

477
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:49,996
Well, yesterday he took my soda.
This one with my name on it.

478
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,200
And today, it's still here.

479
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,443
You know how many ways
you can alter fate.

480
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,248
<i>Yesterday you met him, today you didn't.</i>

481
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:01,807
It's impossible to predict
how that might alter things.

482
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,644
Yeah, I guess.

483
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:12,160
Just give him a chance.
I think you'll be happy that you did.

484
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,488
He's next door.

485
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,710
It'll get easier.

486
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,051
What's that?

487
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:38,246
This. Doing what we do.

488
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,485
All these people.

489
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:45,726
Taken before their time.
Sometimes it just doesn't seem fair.

490
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,362
Never really thought about it.

491
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:53,001
That's one way to deal, I guess.

492
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:56,534
But if you ever want to talk,
sometimes it helps.

493
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:01,175
You know what I think is unfair?

494
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:05,043
When tubes and machines
keep people alive.

495
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,085
When life is prolonged
beyond its usefulness.

496
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,553
That's what's unfair.

497
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:17,691
- Yeah, I guess.
- I'll be honest with you. For my money...

498
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,458
I think that death
was one of the fairest things...

499
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:23,398
that ever happened
to some of these people.

500
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,862
You said you hadn't thought about it.

501
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,296
You caught me.

502
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:34,567
Anyway, I just wanted to say welcome.
I'm Tru.

503
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,207
- Like the name on the soda can.
- Yeah, that's right.

504
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,044
Jack.

505
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:49,014
And, um...

506
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,887
And thanks for making me feel
so welcome.

507
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:57,066
It's never easy being the new guy.

508
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,185
It feels familiar, doesn't it?

509
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,939
- You okay?
- Yeah.

510
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,247
- Don't move. Stay here.
- Dad, no, he'll kill you. He killed Mom.

511
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,551
I don't care what the cops say,
I swear it's him.

512
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:01,524
I believe you.

513
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:05,125
And that's why this has to end.

514
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,925
No, Dad.
Lock the door, wait here for me.

515
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,663
You're growing a conscience
in your old age, Richard?

516
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:51,003
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- The man you paid to kill your first wife.

517
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:56,271
- At least, if I remember correctly.
- We had a deal. I pay you, you go away.

518
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:00,942
You didn't honor it, so now it ends.

519
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:06,078
Now, I mentioned the letter, right?

520
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:10,618
The letter detailing everything
that's sent to your daughter...

521
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:13,024
if I meet an untimely death?

522
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:25,875
Tru, go!

523
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:28,670
<i>Go!</i>

524
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:32,907
Now!

525
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:56,036
When we meet next,
there won't be any warning shot...

526
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,801
there won't be any chase down an alley.

527
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,308
It's just going to be
a bullet through your heart.

528
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:03,077
Goodbye, Carl.

529
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,255
Did you....Is he....

530
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,234
It's over, sweetheart.

531
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:29,636
It's over.

532
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,532
Daddy's taken care of it.
