00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,892
<i>PreviousIy on</i> Tru Calling:

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,970
Anyway, I just wanted to say welcome.
I'm Tru.

3
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,026
Jack.

4
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:06,537
A couple of years ago...

5
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:07,698
I died.

6
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:09,365
And then, I came back.

7
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,944
Some would say once you survive
something like that...

8
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,775
that you were brought back for a reason.

9
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,405
I guess we'll see.

10
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:16,574
How did it go with Jack?

11
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,708
I just can't get a read on him,
for some reason.

12
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,151
One minute he's in your face
and almost obnoxious.

13
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,746
The next, he's charming,
trying to be your best friend.

14
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,483
Leave the key. Step away from the car.

15
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,288
Hang on to your keys, Harrison.

16
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,329
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

17
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,058
What, you got some kind of death wish?

18
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:35,124
Death isn't something
you have to wish for. It's coming anyway.

19
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,669
Death is part of life.

20
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,069
Someone stopped us from saving her.

21
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,506
But that doesn't make any sense.

22
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,783
<i>So you ended up ordering takeout?</i>
<i>What did you get?</i>

23
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:57,288
Moo Shu pork.

24
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,782
<i>Nice choice. With the pancakes?</i>

25
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,884
No, straight from the box. You?

26
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:05,829
I'm just digging into a rack of lamb
with some garlic mashed potatoes.

27
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,262
Cereal again?
<i>Yeah.</i>

28
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,427
The doctor says I'm fiber- poor.

29
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:12,502
So what are you doing tonight?

30
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,665
You know, the usual.

31
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:16,134
Nothing?

32
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,403
Exactly.

33
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,946
Look, me being alone on a Friday night
is one thing...

34
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,413
but you, on the other hand....

35
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,576
With my life,
it's rejuvenating to have a night off.

36
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:28,485
And besides, I told you. I'm between exes.

37
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,013
What?

38
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,482
It's okay to say that you miss someone.

39
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,194
Luc? Why would you say that I miss Luc?

40
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,593
I didn't say Luc. You said Luc.

41
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:38,921
Yeah, well--

42
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:42,456
<i>The way I see it is,</i>
<i>just because we're aIone...</i>

43
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,969
<i>doesn't mean that we're IoneIy.</i>

44
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:49,367
So by that reasoning, you'd argue
that my neighbor across the way?

45
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,637
She looks like
she's having the time of her life.

46
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,679
<i>She's probabIy miserabIe.</i>

47
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:57,773
Gotta tell you, Davis,
it sure seems like she's having fun to me.

48
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,885
<i>Trust me.</i>
<i>Nothing is ever exactIy what it seems.</i>

49
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,980
Listen, I've got to go.

50
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,185
The <i>Outer Limits</i> marathon
is about to start.

51
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,591
I'll let you go.

52
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,595
<i>Tru, for what it's worth...</i>

53
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:13,689
I happen to think that you have
a pretty exciting life, you know?

54
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:14,755
Time travel...

55
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,166
<i>saving Iives, pretty cooI boss.</i>

56
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,172
Yeah. Good night, Davis.

57
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:21,873
Good night, Tru.

58
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,843
<i>Leave me a message, I'II caII you back.</i>

59
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:33,249
Consider this a warning.
You can make all the trouble you want...

60
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,117
but it's only a matter of time
before I find you.

61
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:40,087
And when I do, let's just say
there won't be a second warning.

62
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,536
Help me.

63
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:23,997
Delivery!

64
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,069
Coming.

65
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,347
4B, not 3B.

66
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,514
Four, as in upstairs!

67
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,311
Tru? Hey.

68
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,612
I haven't seen you around much.
I thought you moved.

69
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,980
No, I've just been working
some weird hours lately.

70
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,782
But the delivery man
left this at my door by accident.

71
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,379
Cool. Thanks.

72
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,759
Hey, Tru!

73
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,863
Can I get your advice on something?

74
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,058
Sure.

75
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,228
There is this girl.

76
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,130
And she lives nearby...

77
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:35,401
and she is amazing.

78
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:36,464
Right.

79
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,170
She's always busy
running around all over town...

80
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:43,443
but whenever I see her,
she just makes me want to smile.

81
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:45,811
I see.

82
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,209
Yeah, and, well...

83
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:52,854
I've been wanting
to ask her out for a while...

84
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:57,453
but I'm afraid that if she says no,
things will get weird.

85
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,294
You know, on account of us
being neighbors.

86
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,458
Yeah.

87
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,471
I would advise you...

88
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:10,008
to first make sure that she's ready to date.

89
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,708
And after that, I would take things slow.

90
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,748
Right. Yeah. Slow.

91
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,908
Very slow, you know?

92
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,513
Okay. Makes sense.

93
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:24,620
- Okay. Thank you.
- No problem.

94
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,970
Just the morgue attendant
I was looking for.

95
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,506
I'll bet you say that to all the girls.

96
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:44,042
Remember I told you
I was looking for a new apartment?

97
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,511
I found the perfect one- bedroom.
It's close to work, utilities included.

98
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,639
- Congrats.
- I haven't signed the lease yet...

99
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,344
- 'cause I wanted to run it by you first.
- Me, why?

100
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:55,615
The thing is, it's in the building
across the street from yours...

101
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,918
and I didn't want you feeling crowded
or anything.

102
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,617
So I figured I should check with you.

103
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,284
Are you kidding? You should jump on it.

104
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:04,363
Places in my neighborhood
are so hard to find.

105
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,488
Morning, gang.

106
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,795
Hey, you got your state license forms.

107
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,893
Davis only called me three times
to remind me.

108
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,302
So you're sure about this?

109
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:17,207
Positive. It'll be so nice
to have a friend across the street.

110
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,744
- Guess I got a lease to sign.
- Sweet.

111
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,609
See you.
Okay, bye.

112
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,111
Signed and dated. Perfect.

113
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,089
You put the morgue
as your mailing address.

114
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,182
I hope that's okay.

115
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,853
I've been staying at a friend's place
since I moved here.

116
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,795
- Figured this was the best place to get me.
- Not a problem.

117
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:42,164
As a matter of fact,
you got some mail this morning.

118
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,599
Here it is.

119
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,269
The Schenkman Center.
That's an impressive facility.

120
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,969
Yeah, one of the best in the country.

121
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,304
Were you there long?
I don't remember it being on your résumé.

122
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,816
It was a long time ago.
I didn't think it was relevant.

123
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,444
Did you ever run into a guy
named Tom Forrester?

124
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,681
An old college buddy of mine.

125
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:06,618
We used to play D&D on the weekends.
We called him Wizard.

126
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,092
Forrester. Yeah, sure. Big fella.

127
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,096
Hell of a guy.
Yeah.

128
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,061
Good old Wizard. I wonder what he's....

129
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,436
I should give him a call.

130
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,580
So the meet's at noon.

131
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,381
High noon.
Don't be so dramatic.

132
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,015
It's the first time me and Lindsay
are seeing each other since the breakup.

133
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,184
We're exchanging stuff.
How is that not dramatic?

134
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,091
Look, I want you both to be happy.

135
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:46,222
But the truth is,
it's not so bad being single.

136
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,931
Who are you kidding? Not me.

137
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:53,434
And you've been busted up
since you and Luc split.

138
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:56,067
That's just not true.
Yeah?

139
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,076
And what's your love life now?

140
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,544
Talking on the phone with Davis all day?

141
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,844
Telling me your upstairs neighbor
has a crush on you?

142
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,816
You're pleasant today.

143
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,313
You're right, I'm sorry.

144
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,821
I'm just nervous.

145
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,148
Anyway, I got to get going.

146
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,750
Whose turn is it?

147
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:18,094
You ask that like we actually take turns.

148
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,257
Yeah, well, I'll get the next one.

149
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,096
I'll hold my breath.

150
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:29,507
I don't care. You listen to me,
for the last time, leave me alone.

151
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,145
My neighbor looks like
she's having the time of her life.

152
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,575
Some guys won't take no for an answer.

153
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,647
Well, try saying yes.

154
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,885
Yes, you're a psycho.
Yes, I was right to break up with you.

155
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,617
I'll have to remember that.

156
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,955
You look familiar. Have we met?

157
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:51,320
No, but I've seen you
around the neighborhood.

158
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,989
Thanks, Chris.

159
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,493
- I'm Tru Davies.
- Chris Barronson.

160
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:01,971
- Always nice to put a name with a face.
- Absolutely.

161
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,009
- Thanks. Take care.
- Bye.

162
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,143
One Motley Crue concert tee.

163
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,981
One deck of naked lady cards.

164
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,987
Two eggs of Silly Putty.

165
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:22,589
And 13 assorted comic books.

166
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,589
I've been looking for these.

167
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,996
All right, where's my stuff?

168
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,405
That's it?

169
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,436
Yeah, I turned my place upside down...

170
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,575
and that is all I could find.

171
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,416
That's not even mine.

172
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:45,609
Yeah, well, uh...

173
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,687
Look, the reason I asked you
to meet me here today...

174
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,656
is because I wanted to
look you in the eye...

175
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,322
into those eyes...

176
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,296
and tell you that I want you back.

177
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,357
What?

178
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:06,063
Just give me one more chance,
that's all I'm asking for.

179
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,800
No, I've given you, like, 50 chances...

180
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,342
and you blew every single one of them.

181
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,208
You're just too self- absorbed to know it.

182
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,949
And you're the perfect girlfriend, right?

183
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,144
What?

184
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:23,211
You're so needy. And demanding.

185
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,216
You always order
the most expensive thing on the menu...

186
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,817
when you knew I couldn't afford it.

187
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:33,425
Right?

188
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,655
Hmm?

189
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,135
Take care of yourself, Harrison.

190
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,804
When will I learn to shut my mouth?

191
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,353
Hi. Tom Forrester, please.

192
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:10,997
Hi, Wiz?

193
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,768
Hi, it's Gothar, the Elf King.

194
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,470
Yeah. Davis.

195
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:21,406
Yeah. Listen, turns out
we have a friend in common.

196
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,280
Jack Harper.

197
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:28,218
Yeah, he used to work with you
at Schenkman.

198
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:32,646
Mmm- Hmm.

199
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,854
Really?

200
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,246
Hello?

201
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,156
So your brother and I
are officially through.

202
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,524
Can't say I'm surprised, but I'm so sorry.

203
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,655
<i>He made this sad, Iast- ditch</i>
<i>attempt to patch things up.</i>

204
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,099
<i>And when I said no,</i>
<i>he caIIed me needy and demanding.</i>

205
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,965
<i>Can you beIieve that?</i>

206
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,376
Hello, Tru, you there?

207
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,241
<i>Yeah, sorry, I just....</i>

208
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,942
There's this couple across the building
and they're having this nasty fight.

209
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,449
<i>Are they stiII going at it?</i>

210
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,746
I can't tell.

211
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,153
They just turned the lights off.

212
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,383
One guess. Makeup sex.

213
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:42,552
Yeah, you're probably right.
Anyway, Linds, I got to get to work.

214
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,731
Fine. I'll talk to you later, okay?
<i>Okay.</i>

215
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,641
lncoming.

216
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,373
<i>Hey, Tru?</i>

217
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,010
I thought you said
your neighborhood was getting better?

218
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,075
It is.

219
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,588
I've got a homicide here
that might disagree.

220
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,214
You picked this up near my place?

221
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,124
A building across the street,
if I'm not mistaken.

222
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,823
Victim's name is Chris Barronson,
died from massive head trauma.

223
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,490
Chris Barronson?

224
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,193
Friend of yours?

225
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,898
No, we just met. Today.

226
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:29,204
- You sure you want to see this?
- Yeah.

227
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,348
That's not Chris Barronson.

228
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:40,009
- It's what his lD said.
- No, Chris is a girl.

229
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,889
I saw this guy at her place earlier tonight.

230
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,548
He was furious about something.

231
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:49,560
You know, the cops said something about
thinking the killer was a woman.

232
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,697
Bag this, will you?

233
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,867
Two people, same name, same apartment?

234
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,070
- It's either coincidence...
- Doubtful.

235
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,805
...or our buddy here's been up to no good.

236
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:09,975
Hi, Tru.

237
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,747
I thought you were home for the night.

238
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:15,252
- I was, but--
- Couldn't stay away?

239
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,715
Actually, if you have a moment?

240
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,158
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Can it wait?

241
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,728
It's actually important. We need to talk.

242
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,692
Tru, go ahead. I got this.

243
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,430
- Tru?
- Yeah. Okay, I'm coming.

244
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,268
Please save me.

245
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,582
Delivery!

246
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,192
Delivery!

247
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,725
Wait! Hold on!
You've got the wrong apartment!

248
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,773
Even when you relive days
they still get away.

249
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,539
So your neighbor and victim
have the same name?

250
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,605
He's dead and she's the prime suspect?

251
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,811
Yep. But it wouldn't be any fun
if it were easy.

252
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,912
Okay, well, here's a theory.

253
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,184
Could be identity theft.

254
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,692
He took her identity
and she killed him for it.

255
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,524
ldentity theft is on the rise.

256
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,223
They're either stealing it online...

257
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,960
or taking a picture of your credit card
with a cell phone.

258
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,969
She seemed so normal.
It's hard to imagine her killing anyone.

259
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,061
People can do a lot of things
in self- defense.

260
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,868
Especially when they're pushed
past their limit.

261
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,409
For the last time, leave me alone.

262
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,107
- Maybe you're right.
- Hi, Jack.

263
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:53,111
Sorry to interrupt. I just wanted
to drop off my state license forms.

264
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,986
Super. Thanks.

265
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,414
Hey.
Hi.

266
00:15:56,488 --> 00:16:01,084
We were just going over
the new intake procedure.

267
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,292
Cool. You mind if I check the mail?

268
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:07,355
Unfortunately, this is the only address
most people have for me.

269
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,333
- No, go ahead.
- Thanks.

270
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,262
Tru, about the new intake procedure.

271
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:19,071
Were there any other clues
about the victim's real identity?

272
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,409
He had a pen with a logo on it.

273
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,973
It was a sunburst with a capital"A" inside.

274
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,421
Probably from his work. I'll look into it.

275
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,220
An identity thief with a day job.

276
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,851
All the better to meet new victims.

277
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,590
I got to get going.
Chris will be at the diner any minute.

278
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,462
Okay. I'll call you if anything comes up.

279
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,961
There was something else...

280
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,333
you wanted to tell me
right before the day rewound.

281
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,668
- I did?
- You said it was important.

282
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,133
No clue. Too bad I don't relive days.

283
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,940
But look on the bright side.

284
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,982
If you don't change
too many things today...

285
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,381
then we'll have
the same conversation tonight.

286
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:00,918
Here's hoping.

287
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,714
Yeah. A redo day.
I get it. No time for breakfast.

288
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,315
But considering you're 24 hours
ahead of me...

289
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,088
<i>what happened with Lindsay yesterday?</i>

290
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,423
Do you want my advice?

291
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,397
Save the sit- down for another day.
Another week even.

292
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:14,762
Man. It was that bad?

293
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,733
Put it this way: Yeah.

294
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,561
All right. Thanks for the heads up.

295
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:23,505
Too bad you're blowing off breakfast
'cause I would've picked up the tab today.

296
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:26,100
It must be nice living in your world, Harry.

297
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,869
Jack, is Tru around?

298
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,347
- You just missed her, man.
- Damn.

299
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,984
I needed to ask her something.
There's kind of a time factor.

300
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,248
She should be on her cell.

301
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,085
No, this is one of those things
that's best to do in person.

302
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,955
Make sure she means what she says.

303
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:44,553
You mean women don't always say
what they actually mean?

304
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,732
Not the ones I fall for.

305
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,597
See you, man.
Yeah.

306
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,200
<i>You're finished. The fun is over.</i>

307
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,743
For the last time, leave me alone.

308
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,171
Coffee, please.

309
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,714
Some guys,
they just can't take no for an answer.

310
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:14,190
- Ex- boyfriend?
- It's sort of a long story.

311
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,590
Thanks, Chris.

312
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:21,158
You know, you look familiar.
You don't live on York by any chance?

313
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,598
Yeah, I do.

314
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:26,235
- Same here. I'm Tru Davies.
- Chris Barronson.

315
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,670
It's always nice to put a name with a face.

316
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,708
Chris Barronson.

317
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,142
Yeah. Have you heard of me?

318
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,273
Sort of. There was this guy
outside your building this morning...

319
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:41,308
asking all these questions about you.
He seemed pretty belligerent.

320
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:44,412
About 6', dark brown hair?

321
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,725
Same guy who just can't take no
for an answer?

322
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,491
Only he's not an ex.

323
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,729
Well, it's nothing I should get into.

324
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,826
If you're heading home,
I could walk with you.

325
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,371
You know, in case he's still around.

326
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,906
- Okay.
- Okay.

327
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,943
It was six months ago...

328
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,943
when I found out he'd stolen my identity.

329
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:10,243
I was applying for a loan,
and the bank ran a credit check.

330
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,341
They found 10 different credit cards
in my name.

331
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,683
He'd used them to run up
nearly $60, 000 in charges.

332
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,346
And now he's threatening you?

333
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:21,221
- Because I went to the police.
- No arrest?

334
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,227
lD theft's tricky to prosecute.

335
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,264
You need absolute proof,
which I don't have.

336
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:30,995
But it's getting worse because now I feel
like someone's been watching me.

337
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,739
That's creepy.
Any idea how this all started?

338
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,774
No, but there's a million ways.

339
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,844
If you don't have a shredder, a firewall...

340
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,675
a digitally scrambled phone...

341
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,910
you may as well have a sign up saying:
Ruin my life.

342
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,308
Anyway, thanks for the company.

343
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,179
And do me a favor,
if you see that guy again...

344
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,848
just say I moved or something.

345
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,290
No problem.

346
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,318
Because if I run into him,
there's no telling what might happen.

347
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,701
- Jack?
- Hey.

348
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,808
What are you doing here?
Moving in.

349
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,003
You're kidding?

350
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:15,842
No. I saw the"For Rent" sign
and snapped it up.

351
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,712
Lucky for me.
The guy who was supposed to take it...

352
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:22,686
missed the deadline'cause he had to
run it by his girlfriend or something.

353
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,814
The thing is, it's in the building
across the street from yours...

354
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,483
and I didn't want you feeling crowded.

355
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,960
But his loss is my gain.
Third floor, great view. Unbelievable.

356
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,223
So I've heard.

357
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:36,028
I got to get started with
the packing process. I'll see you later on.

358
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:41,061
Tru, your friend, who I just met.

359
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,835
She wouldn't happen to be single,
would she?

360
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:46,706
I'm not sure a new guy
is what she needs right now.

361
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,302
Besides, a word of advice.

362
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,973
Girls don't appreciate
being hit on by their neighbors.

363
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,176
We need to find
some more interesting neighbors.

364
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,278
Maybe you need to find
some less desperate tenants.

365
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,188
Look, she's having guy trouble right now.

366
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,551
A bad breakup?
Not exactly.

367
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:07,926
All right. Fine. Don't tell me.
I'll find out on my own soon enough.

368
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,764
Hey, wait.

369
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,999
The truth is, there's this guy
that's been harassing her...

370
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,595
and the last thing she needs is--

371
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,606
- Two.
- Yeah.

372
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,108
Enough said.

373
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,304
Okay.
You know, Tru...

374
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,244
if that other guy really is a problem,
I wouldn't mind keeping an eye on her.

375
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,016
I know you think I'm heartless...

376
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:33,353
but I have been known to show an interest
in people other than myself.

377
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,683
Thanks, but I've got it under control.

378
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,491
I'd expect no less.

379
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,392
Hello.
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

380
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,268
I found your logo and your identity thief.

381
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:49,465
Really?

382
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:52,566
It's a company called Advantix.
They sell medical equipment.

383
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,738
And there is a salesman there
by the name of Chris Barronson.

384
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,872
Did you get an address?

385
00:21:56,948 --> 00:22:00,645
Don't need to. He's coming to the morgue
in 20 minutes to make a presentation.

386
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,311
You made an appointment with the guy?

387
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:04,947
I told him we weren't happy
with our current distributor.

388
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,490
You're always chasing the bad guy.

389
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,492
<i>Why not make them come to you for once?</i>

390
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,028
Nice, D. I'll see you in 20.
<i>Okay.</i>

391
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,131
This is my colleague, Tru.
This is Chris Barronson.

392
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,095
Please save me.

393
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,636
This is my first sales call to a morgue.

394
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:27,702
Most of our equipment's designed
to keep the patient out of a place like this.

395
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,475
Everyone passes through sooner or later.

396
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:31,675
Right.

397
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,981
Anyway, let me show you guys
what might be useful.

398
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,421
Had this job long, Mr. Barronson?

399
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,219
Eight, nine months. Why?

400
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,987
Does it pay well?

401
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,556
Only if you buy what I sell.

402
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,431
I guess you don't sell that much.

403
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,533
All right. Who are you people?

404
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,201
I think who you are is the bigger question.

405
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:00,300
What?

406
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:04,143
We know who the real Chris Barronson is
and you are not her.

407
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,481
And it's only a matter of time
before the police figure that out.

408
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,213
Right. She's good.

409
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,018
I'll give her that.
She pulled a fast one on you guys.

410
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:16,356
- I don't think you get it.
- No, I do. You don't get it.

411
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,828
All right, the police are on my side.

412
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:22,025
Except they're too inept
to do anything about it.

413
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,534
Look, I'm the real Chris Barronson, okay?

414
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,764
Here, see?

415
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:30,174
All right? She stole my identity.

416
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,574
And if you guys know who she is...

417
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:36,512
you'd better talk some sense into her
before I find her myself.

418
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:59,897
The DMV has his picture on file
back to the early'90s.

419
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,940
The state police confirm
there were six identity theft reports...

420
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,032
filed by a man named Chris Barronson.

421
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:06,804
Looks like he's the real deal.

422
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,142
Which means
the girl you met in the diner isn't.

423
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,647
She probably gave me that name...

424
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:13,047
because it was on the credit card
she was using.

425
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,983
I've spent the day helping a con woman...

426
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,613
while the guy who needs help
wants nothing to do with me.

427
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:20,419
Helping the criminal may be
the only way to help the victim.

428
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,325
Since the real Chris won't talk to you,
focus on the fake one.

429
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,955
See if you can't keep her
from committing a murder today.

430
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,020
Right.

431
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,028
Hello.
<i>It's Jack.</i>

432
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:33,002
<i>What's up?</i>
Your friend's on the move.

433
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,129
She left the building?
<i>But don't worry.</i>

434
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,435
I'm keeping an eye on her.
<i>You foIIowed her?</i>

435
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,375
You seemed worried about her.
Thought I was doing you a favor.

436
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:41,605
<i>Where is she now?</i>

437
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,080
She's headed back
into your neighborhood.

438
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,516
But about an hour ago,
she was in a jewelry store downtown.

439
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,053
Did she buy anything?

440
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,680
Yeah, a necklace.
But she didn't keep it long.

441
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,815
She walked six blocks to a pawnshop...

442
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:57,453
and sold it for half of what
she just paid for it. Crazy.

443
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,728
<i>She's aImost home now.</i>

444
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,926
She's all yours. I got some errands to run.

445
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,129
Wait, Jack?

446
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:07,501
You got to let me hang up
so you can miss me.

447
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,073
Cute, but, no.

448
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,540
You followed her.
I can't help wondering why.

449
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,635
She looked like she might be in trouble.

450
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:17,442
And aside from a little white- collar crime,
she's harmless.

451
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,713
Just be careful.
She's not exactly who she seems.

452
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,280
Who is?

453
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,616
- Jack is following her?
- He was trying to help.

454
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:30,054
Listen, I want you to take this
before you go.

455
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:34,189
It's the name and the number
of the cop I talked to, just in case.

456
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,302
Who's Tom Forrester?

457
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:45,035
He's an old college buddy of mine,
but I haven't talked to him in years. Why?

458
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,111
Yesterday, you had a note to call him.

459
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,510
Remember to find out
what it is you want to tell me.

460
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,879
We have to keep the days
as similar as possible.

461
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,417
Okay. I'll give him a ring.

462
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,976
He's a hell of a guy.
Great Dungeon Master.

463
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,549
God, did I just say that out loud?

464
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:09,663
Harrison.

465
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,861
Look, about today, I....

466
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,234
<i>Let me guess.</i>
<i>Not gonna work for you.</i>

467
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,897
No, not so much.

468
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,074
You lost all my stuff, didn't you?

469
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,703
No. It's not that. It's just....

470
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,247
It just isn't the best day for it.

471
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:24,304
Why not?

472
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:26,441
Well, because, I got to....

473
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,419
It just isn't. Okay?

474
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:33,253
Fine. Whatever. We'll just do it tomorrow,
same time, same place.

475
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,919
I'll be there. I promise.
<i>Yeah. Bye.</i>

476
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,862
You better be right about this, Tru.

477
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,762
Excuse me, miss?

478
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,842
I didn't want you to forget this.

479
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,804
- Randall?
- Lindsay?

480
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,108
My God.

481
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,950
Feel like telling me who you really are?

482
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,116
I already told you. I'm Chris Barronson.

483
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,023
Look, don't bother. I know you're not.

484
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,652
I know you've been buying jewelry...

485
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,857
with someone else's credit card
and pawning it off for quick cash.

486
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,092
How did you know that?

487
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,794
It doesn't really matter.
It's just time for you to stop.

488
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,962
Just give this guy, Chris, his life back.

489
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,629
I will. Someday.

490
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,641
Someday isn't soon enough.
Trust me on this.

491
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:28,807
I don't trust anyone.
That's why I'm so good at what I do.

492
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,204
Stay out of it, Tru.

493
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,441
You're in over your head.

494
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,959
Hey, Tru. What a nice surprise.
How's it going?

495
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,326
Good, thanks.

496
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:48,594
I got a package for you delivered to me
inadvertently this morning.

497
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,895
Do you want to come up and....

498
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:50,957
There's this girl.

499
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,025
Right.

500
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,764
I've been wanting to ask her out.

501
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,207
You know what? I'll just drop it off later.

502
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:57,707
I'll save you the time, okay?

503
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,108
I'd be happy to come by.
I'd love to see your place.

504
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,909
- I'm actually just in a hurry, so....
- Okay.

505
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,574
Can I ask you one question?

506
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,311
Sorry, I'm in the middle of something.

507
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:10,081
But I'll catch up with you later, okay?

508
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:12,419
<i>What is she doing now?</i>
Looks like she's packing.

509
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,924
<i>What is she doing now?</i>
Looks like she's packing.

510
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,291
<i>That's good.</i>
<i>Maybe you spooked her enough...</i>

511
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,354
<i>so she'II be gone by the time</i>
<i>the reaI Chris Barronson shows up.</i>

512
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,161
Maybe, but we can't count on it.

513
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,794
- I talked to Tom Forrester, by the way.
- And?

514
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,338
He told me about his wife and his kids...

515
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:31,000
and his research
after leaving the Schenkman Center.

516
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,543
But it's certainly nothing
I need to discuss with you.

517
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:34,578
It was worth a shot.

518
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,647
<i>You don't think</i>
<i>that the important thing...</i>

519
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:40,879
has anything to do with the kidney stone
I passed last week, do you?

520
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:44,248
Okay, probably not. I'll keep looking.

521
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:08,438
I know you think you can handle this,
but you're the one in over her head.

522
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:12,908
<i>It'II onIy get worse.</i>
<i>Running won't soIve anything.</i>

523
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:16,010
Let me help you
or I'll tell the police where to find you.

524
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,452
It's your choice.

525
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:37,365
It was just so easy, you know?
Like free money.

526
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:41,370
And at first, I only did it to get by.
But now, it's....

527
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:45,749
God, you got to believe me.
I had no idea it would go this far.

528
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,612
Okay. But it has.

529
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:51,382
And now we have to do
something about it.

530
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,522
I'm scared.

531
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:57,226
The messages
this guy's been leaving for me.

532
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,987
What if I paid him back?

533
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:03,296
Do you think he would still
turn me in to the police?

534
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,199
You can pay him back?

535
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,662
Yeah, I could give him cash.

536
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:09,740
Really? You have that much money?

537
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,706
I told you, I was good.

538
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,245
If only that were something to be proud of.

539
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,156
You. You turned my life upside down.

540
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:31,093
She wants to make amends.
That's why I called.

541
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,926
Sure, now that I know where to find her.

542
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:37,963
- I'm so sorry.
- You're sorry?

543
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,003
- I'm so sorry.
- You're sorry?

544
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,800
- No, I really am.
- Sorry doesn't cover it.

545
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,868
Here. Maybe this will.

546
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:01,184
It's the least I can do
with you giving me a second chance.

547
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,360
I almost forgot. Here.

548
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,364
The credit card I took out
in your name.

549
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:11,366
If I ever hear from you again,
or if I see you--

550
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,960
You won't. I promise.

551
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:18,533
Fine.

552
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,070
I have a phone call to make.

553
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:24,080
And you?
You should be gone when I get back.

554
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,287
Thanks, Tru.

555
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:34,356
I know you probably don't care...

556
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,118
but my real name is Cathy.

557
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,457
It's nice to meet you, Cathy.

558
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:44,394
Here, let me get this.
No, I got it.

559
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,563
This one's on me.

560
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:51,339
Thank you again for everything.

561
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,278
Hey.

562
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:07,950
You caught me using a city vehicle
for personal business.

563
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,516
What vehicle?

564
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:12,491
I want to thank you
for helping me out today.

565
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:15,031
It's nothing
you wouldn't have done for me. Thanks.

566
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,432
Still, I mean you took it upon yourself
to look out for someone...

567
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:21,529
I told you was in trouble,
no questions asked.

568
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,607
Should I have asked some?

569
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:26,371
I can't help thinking most people would.

570
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,775
Whatever's going on
between you and your friend...

571
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,336
it's none of my business.

572
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,611
- It's never stopped you before.
- All right, fine.

573
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:35,914
Tell me.

574
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:38,019
And if I don't?

575
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:41,489
I'll ply you with alcohol
and pry it out of you.

576
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,087
Right.

577
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,525
Or you'll owe me one.

578
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,891
Lock up the van for me, will you?

579
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:52,165
- Keys?
- They must be inside.

580
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,857
- I talked to Tom Forrester.
- And?

581
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:18,054
He told me about his research
after leaving the Schenkman Center.

582
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,737
Here you go.

583
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,837
I guess you can lock up yourself.

584
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,385
Hey.
Hey.

585
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:46,480
Could I get a roast beef sandwich to go?

586
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:47,922
Sure thing.

587
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:53,059
- Nothing smaller?
- No, not tonight.

588
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:02,137
I'm sorry, but this bill's a fake.

589
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,968
You got to be kidding me.

590
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:14,244
You said your friend Tom
worked at the Schenkman Center, right?

591
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,218
Did you mention Jack
when you spoke to him?

592
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:17,413
No, why would I?

593
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:20,048
Jack had a letter
from the Schenkman Center in his coat.

594
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:21,921
I bet you found it first yesterday.

595
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,688
Why don't I give Tom another call?

596
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:26,594
Yeah, just let me know
what he says, okay?

597
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,195
Here we go again.

598
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:43,343
Lock yourself out?

599
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:47,974
Yeah, it happens to me
at least once a week.

600
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:50,712
Here, I'm sorry. I'm the new tenant.

601
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,813
I appreciate it.
You bet.

602
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:55,649
Here you go.
Thank you.

603
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:21,743
Matt?

604
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:03,154
Now I feel like someone's
been watching me.

605
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,270
There is this girl.

606
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:21,106
And she lives nearby.

607
00:36:58,749 --> 00:36:59,909
Chris.

608
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,348
<i>What is he doing?</i>

609
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:15,090
Matt?

610
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,610
Come on.
<i>HeIIo?</i>

611
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:35,151
Jack, it's Tru! I need to get in.

612
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:38,086
Hey, Tru. What are you doing
on this side of the street?

613
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:41,056
Please, Jack, I need to
get into Cathy's apartment right away.

614
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,752
Cathy? Who's Cathy?

615
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:45,557
Chris. Chris is Cathy.
The girl that you followed.

616
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,564
- Please, Jack, hurry!
- Okay.

617
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,564
<i>Let me just try and figure this thing out.</i>

618
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,334
<i>It's trickier than I thought.</i>

619
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:00,409
<i>Did that do it?</i>

620
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,206
Thanks. Excuse me.

621
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:07,150
<i>Tru, did that do it?</i>

622
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:08,741
Tru?

623
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:11,744
Tru?

624
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,024
I'm telling you, stay away from her!

625
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:24,061
She's a nice girl!

626
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:25,894
Put it down, Matt.

627
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,268
He broke into her apartment!
He wants to hurt her!

628
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:31,637
I know you want to protect her,
but you don't know anything about her!

629
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,643
Yes, I do! I watched her every single day
since she moved in.

630
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,111
I know her better than anyone.

631
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,375
No, she's not who you think.
Look, she's a thief.

632
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,474
She stole this man's identity.

633
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:44,510
No. She can't be. She's perfect!
She would never do that!

634
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:47,318
It's okay, Matt.
You're not the only one that she's fooled.

635
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:50,451
But I'm telling you the truth.
She's stolen thousands of dollars.

636
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,689
She's ruined people's lives.

637
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,124
She's a thief?

638
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,031
I'm sorry.

639
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,245
I'm sorry.

640
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,717
Are you okay?

641
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,583
Why did you come here?
I thought that we had an agreement.

642
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,015
Yeah, we did.

643
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:26,795
Till I found out
that the money she gave me was fake.

644
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:30,800
Now she's gone, I'm still broke...

645
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,900
and I'm probably
never gonna see her again.

646
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,062
You never know.

647
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,269
Stranger things have happened.

648
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:47,283
I don't understand what's taking so long.
It's been 45 minutes already.

649
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:48,875
I'm very sorry.

650
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,778
Did my card not go through?

651
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:53,119
The card number's fine,
but our computer's down.

652
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:57,456
Just give us another minute,
we'll get you all sorted out, Miss Davies.

653
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:59,519
Heading out of town, Tru?

654
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:04,995
You know, it's a good thing
I don't believe every sob story I hear.

655
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,696
Mine, for example?

656
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,136
You almost had me.

657
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,969
But then you absolutely blew it
back there at the diner.

658
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,667
This one's on me.

659
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:20,744
You pulled out your camera cell phone
the second I put my credit card down.

660
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,116
All I had to do
was call the credit card company...

661
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,178
and report a stolen credit card.

662
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:29,317
I knew you had the number,
but I was hoping that you wouldn't use it.

663
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,189
Then I got the call.

664
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:36,763
<i>Miss, there's activity reported</i>
<i>on your credit card at A vaIon Car RentaI.</i>

665
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,199
Thank you.

666
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,406
Is it too late for me to explain?

667
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:45,203
To me? Yeah.

668
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:48,676
But I know a couple of guys
who'd be happy to listen.

669
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:57,911
Really, you had a good day?
<i>It was the best, Tru.</i>

670
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,218
The perfect afternoon
with the perfect guy.

671
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,315
Wait, you were with my brother?

672
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,791
No. Harrison was his usual self.

673
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:07,126
Called to cancel after I was already there.

674
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:08,756
But that's how I spotted Randall.

675
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:09,822
Randall?

676
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,494
I met him a few years ago
when I was studying abroad.

677
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:16,700
<i>He's actuaIIy in town for a few weeks</i>
<i>and he's a totaI opposite of your brother.</i>

678
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:17,831
Well, lucky break.

679
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:21,434
Just when I was starting to think
they didn't make them like this anymore.

680
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,638
Yeah, I know what you mean.

681
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:26,306
Good night, Tru.

682
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:33,382
<i>Hey, it's Luc.</i>
<i>I couIdn't get to the phone right now.</i>

683
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:34,924
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

684
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:37,492
Hey, Luc, it's me, Tru.

685
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:39,927
I heard through the grapevine...

686
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,659
<i>that you missed out on that apartment</i>
<i>across the street...</i>

687
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:45,634
<i>and I just wanted to caII</i>
<i>and say that I'm sorry.</i>

688
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:48,968
<i>I know that we're not together anymore...</i>

689
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:53,339
but it would've been nice to be neighbors.
Just to know you were close.

690
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:57,214
<i>I'II taIk to you soon. I just wanted to caII.</i>

691
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,013
Okay, bye.

692
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:14,588
Luc?

693
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,326
No, Tru. It's me, I'm sorry.

694
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:20,197
I saw the morgue number and thought
he was working tonight. What's up?

695
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,762
I talked to my friend at Schenkman.

696
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,967
What I had to tell you
is definitely about Jack.

697
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,944
Turns out he was a patient there.

698
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:32,813
A patient?
But Schenkman's a psychiatric facility.

699
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,511
It seems like he was there voluntarily.

700
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,851
He checked himself in
so he could check himself out.

701
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:42,151
Well, we knew
something was off with Jack, but--

702
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,693
<i>There's more.</i>

703
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:46,457
<i>When Jack committed himseIf,</i>
<i>he thought he was going crazy.</i>

704
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,430
But the doctors couldn't diagnosis it.

705
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,526
Going crazy how?

706
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:54,968
He thought he was reliving days.

707
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:58,741
Reliving days?

708
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:01,138
Like me?

709
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:07,944
Exactly like you.
