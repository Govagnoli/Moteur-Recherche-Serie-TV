1
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,043
Hey, Tru.

2
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,180
Ronny.

3
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:19,645
Prom is coming up.

4
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:22,786
- Is it?
- Yeah, and you know I wanted to....

5
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:29,386
Ronny, anything you want to tell me...

6
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:32,526
or ask me, you go right ahead.

7
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,271
Candace, not now. I'll call you later, okay?

8
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,467
I'm really sorry, Tru, but this can't wait.

9
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:46,841
What he's trying to say is that
he wants to go to the prom with me.

10
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,339
What?

11
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:53,243
Candace, how could you do this to me?
We're best friends.

12
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,879
Tru, high school's nearly over,
and everyone knows...

13
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:59,584
that high school friendships don't last.
So why would I let a friendship...

14
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:03,993
that's probably going to end anyway,
get in the way of something I want?

15
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,464
Try not to take it so hard. Things change.

16
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:09,862
<i>See you.</i>

17
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:19,842
Thank God.

18
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,679
Did you nod off?

19
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,789
What's this?

20
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,452
"High school reunion." You going to this?

21
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:38,429
Go back to high school? Absolutely...

22
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,025
not.

23
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,839
Help me.

24
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:16,995
I can't believe you.

25
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:20,470
How many times will you say
you're not coming to the reunion tonight?

26
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,269
It'll be fun.
Lindsay.

27
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:26,711
Okay, for the last time, you are coming,
even if I have to drag you there myself.

28
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:30,146
You can try, but I'm warning you.
My girl's stubborn.

29
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,514
Come on. I'm going.

30
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:36,344
- Harrison, you weren't even in our class.
- I was two years behind.

31
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,890
And Lindsay's taking me as her date.

32
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:43,551
Good. Go. Have fun, and you can tell me
all about it tomorrow.

33
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,264
Is she okay?

34
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,400
Guess I'll go find out.

35
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:54,596
So, just out of curiosity,
did you have friends in our class?

36
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:59,542
Well, not five years ago.
But now I have you.

37
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,680
Did I miss something back there?

38
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,947
I just don't want to go
to my high school reunion is all.

39
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,715
- That bad?
- Parts of it.

40
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:12,519
Parts of it were great.
I'm just not so keen on reliving it.

41
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,494
Look, I didn't know you back then.

42
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,696
I'm not even sure I know you now.

43
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,734
But you got a lot to be proud of, Tru.
Good friends.

44
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,736
A cool, if slightly morbid, new job.

45
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,461
Med school's not that far away.

46
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,803
No, I know, it's just--
Plus...

47
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:33,141
you got a cool new boyfriend
you can take to the reunion and show off.

48
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,270
- Really?
- Yeah.

49
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:39,115
I'm so glad you decided to come.

50
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,210
Okay, what do you think?
Too much cleavage?

51
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,415
Shame on you. No such thing.

52
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,420
You know what you should wear?
Those pinstriped pants you got downtown.

53
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:49,859
Definitely.

54
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,094
You know what? Meredith borrowed them
two months ago...

55
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:57,296
and left them at the dry cleaners.
All she left me was this ticket.

56
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,769
- How is Meredith, anyway?
- Good. Rehab is going well.

57
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,034
- She'll be home in a few weeks.
- Good.

58
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:05,475
Don't worry.
I'll pick something out for you.

59
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,810
Here, start with these. We'll build around.

60
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,650
Hey, do you remember Craig Burg?

61
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:19,658
- Soccer goalie, total hottie. Sure.
- I had the hugest crush on him.

62
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,956
Yeah. You left him that note.

63
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,792
Yeah. I told him everything
about how I felt...

64
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,424
put it in his locker, waited for him
to do something.

65
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,695
- And what did he do?
- Nothing.

66
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,466
He just never even responded.
God, I think about that all the time.

67
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,169
You think he'll be there tonight?

68
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,871
- One way to find out.
- Yes.

69
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,716
My God, back in high school.

70
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:55,216
Just for a few hours. Just breathe.
Stay strong.

71
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,922
Come on, let's check out some snacks.

72
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,899
Okay, I'll find you later.
Just remember, breathe.

73
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,695
Billy?

74
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:07,997
Hi.

75
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,911
That's a nice tie. I didn't know
people were still wearing those...

76
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,571
in this century.

77
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,177
- Who's that?
- Candace Aimes.

78
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,486
- You know her?
- We used to be best friends.

79
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,784
- Tru Davies. It's me.
- Billy.

80
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,895
Billy Lambert. My God, you look great.
I almost didn't recognize you.

81
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,591
Not that you didn't look great
back in high school.

82
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,362
Who are you kidding?
I was a pizza- faced beanpole.

83
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,563
- But that was then, right?
- What's been going on with you, Billy?

84
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,971
I've developed this software
that's gonna revolutionize downloading.

85
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,010
It'll make the MP3 player obsolete.

86
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,239
That's great. I'll see you inside, okay? Bye.

87
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,670
So how you holding up so far?
Glad you came?

88
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,597
My God, it's you!

89
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,073
Judy Rogers.

90
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,875
Judy, of course. How can I forget?
This is my boyfriend.

91
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:25,315
Can you believe it? Everyone here
in one room. It's like we never left.

92
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,548
Don't you love reunion directories?
You can keep tabs on everyone.

93
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,555
Of course, they don't tell the whole story.

94
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:33,421
Like Larry Cutler,
addicted to prescription painkillers.

95
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,053
Judy, this is--
And Kenny Lewis is gay.

96
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,391
<i>Heard about Steve Sabitzsky?</i>

97
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,489
He went into his father's carpet business
and fired his own dad.

98
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,057
Judy was--
And Gillian Kaye? You noticed?

99
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,569
Less nose, more boobs.
All bought and paid for.

100
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,902
Judy was the captain of the swim team.

101
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,738
He's adorable.
Well, honey, you traded up.

102
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,574
That Ronny Clifton,
you heard about him and Candace?

103
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,171
She thinks she's everything
'cause she was Prom Queen.

104
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,274
I had the swim team.
Candace couldn't swim.

105
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,843
I see someone I have to talk to.
But this has been great.

106
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,822
Right.
Nice to meet you.

107
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:13,988
Craig.

108
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,034
Hey, Glenn Carpenter.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

109
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,771
Later. Yeah, sure.

110
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,345
Craig Burg.

111
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,274
Hey.

112
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,945
This is gonna sound a little strange,
but toward the end of senior year...

113
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,922
I left a note in your locker...

114
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,491
and I wrote down how I felt about you...

115
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,052
in detail, embarrassing detail, actually.

116
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,997
And I never got an answer
and I was just wondering, you know?

117
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:52,196
I never got any note.
I'm sorry, what was your name again?

118
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,070
Excuse me for a second.

119
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,631
Hey, what's up, dude?
Hey, big guy.

120
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,117
Voting for tonight's Reunion Queen.
Want to cast your vote?

121
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,948
Yeah. One for Lindsay.

122
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:11,717
Thanks.

123
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:15,752
So what exactly was the deal
with you and this Ronny guy?

124
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:20,323
High school crush gone awry.
But you can ask him yourself.

125
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,599
There he is.

126
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:28,831
I tell you what. I think
I'm going to go get you a refill instead.

127
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,706
Tru.

128
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,616
Hi, Ronny. God, it's been a while.

129
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,951
Last time I saw you,
it was right around prom time.

130
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:51,259
I know it's about five years too late,
but I owe you an apology.

131
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,321
I never meant to hurt you, Tru.

132
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,096
Candace just got what she wanted.
You know, she always did.

133
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,565
- Always will.
- You don't sound too happy about it.

134
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:06,408
Me? No, I'm good. I'm real good.
Life couldn't be any better right now.

135
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:09,937
Hmm.

136
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:13,147
Well, it was real nice seeing you, Ronny.

137
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,723
See you, Tru.

138
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,432
What's the matter?
You looking for someone?

139
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,232
No, nobody.

140
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,739
Well, let's go dance or something.

141
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:40,006
No, thanks.
I'm not really for the dancing thing.

142
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:43,312
Okay. Well, do you want to go
get a drink then?

143
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,447
Hello? Earth to Harrison.

144
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,557
What do you want to do?
I'll be right back.

145
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,733
Who's that?

146
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,832
Mr. Connor.
He is the best teacher I ever had.

147
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,411
He was the first one
who really got through to me.

148
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,970
Made me think for myself.
He changed my life.

149
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,949
So go say hi to him.
It's not that easy.

150
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,443
Look who he's with. Candace.

151
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,045
Time to let bygones be bygones, Tru.

152
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,257
Mr. Connor, hi.

153
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,791
Tru Davies.
I was hoping you'd be here tonight.

154
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,662
<i>I'm so gIad you came.</i>

155
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,224
- Tru.
- Candace.

156
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,925
You look great.

157
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:42,431
I could never get away with an outfit
like that. You are so brave.

158
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,466
- Thanks.
- Is this your boyfriend?

159
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,310
We'll give you a chance
to catch up with Mr. Connor.

160
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,750
Couldn't deny you that.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

161
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,616
I think they're free.

162
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:00,191
Mr. Connor, how are things?
How's the writing?

163
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,456
I remember how you were always
gonna write the great American novel.

164
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:07,158
Actually, Tru, the writing
is going surprisingly well.

165
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,396
I am working on something
that I feel so good about.

166
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,232
Great. That's great.

167
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,874
Still thinking about Candace.

168
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:19,502
I guess some things haven't changed
that much in the last five years.

169
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,375
How's it going, man? Grab one of these?

170
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,039
- Sure.
- Thank you.

171
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,377
- Keith.
- Hey.

172
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,180
- Keith Morgan!
- Hey, what's up, man?

173
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,986
- You don't remember me, do you?
- I'm sorry. I can't say that I do.

174
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,688
Well, I'll tell you what.
How about I remind you?

175
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,093
All right.

176
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:41,556
<i>HeIIo, can I have your attention, pIease?</i>

177
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,727
<i>We've counted aII the baIIots,</i>
<i>and it is now time to announce...</i>

178
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,772
<i>our CIass of'99 Five Year Reunion Queen.</i>

179
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,531
<i>Tonight our Queen is Candace Aimes.</i>

180
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,222
Do you know that
Craig never even got my note?

181
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,021
He doesn't even remember me.

182
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,425
Ouch!

183
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,895
So much for high school memories.

184
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:15,565
Can you believe this?
I can't. It's like a nightmare.

185
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,629
The recurring kind.

186
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,965
Wow!

187
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,106
<i>Thank you so much.</i>
<i>This is such a surprise.</i>

188
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,137
<i>Okay, not that much of a surprise.</i>

189
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:31,172
<i>Anyway, it's so good seeing you aII here.</i>
<i>Some of whom I actuaIIy even remember.</i>

190
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,276
<i>This has been--</i>
I told you I don't know who you are!

191
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:46,992
- Harrison? Jeez! Are you okay?
- Okay? I'm great.

192
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,432
I've waited years
to punch this son of a bitch.

193
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,163
Now I remember. You're that guy
whose ass I used to kick.

194
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:56,173
Is this what you came here for tonight?
Settle some stupid high school grudge?

195
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,641
Yeah.

196
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,671
I mean, no.

197
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,637
I came for you.

198
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,345
You're unbelievable, Harrison.

199
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,087
He'll be fine. But are you all right?

200
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,682
Yeah. Great.

201
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,291
Convincing.

202
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,430
But it kind of looks to me
like you got Candace on the brain.

203
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:23,497
Hey, if you two really were best friends,
now's a good time to go talk to her.

204
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,502
Put things to rest.

205
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,404
- Did you see where Candace went?
- I saw her heading to the pool.

206
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,710
Thanks.

207
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,103
Candace, are you in here?

208
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,236
<i>Oh, no.</i>

209
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,812
- My God! Candace?
- Save me.

210
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,220
Did you nod off?

211
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,426
What's this?

212
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,937
"High school reunion." Cool.
You going to this?

213
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,330
Yes, I am.

214
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:37,969
Again.

215
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,250
Again? You're going
to your high school reunion again?

216
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,017
So does this mean--
My day is repeating itself.

217
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,822
- Who's the lucky victim today?
- Candace Aimes, high school classmate.

218
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,420
- A friend of yours?
- It's complicated.

219
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,466
Let's just say I doubt
she'll really appreciate any of my help.

220
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,763
But she drowned at the reunion yesterday.

221
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,063
Drowned.

222
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,166
Was there fluid in her lungs?

223
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,262
I don't know.

224
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,138
The day rewound before I had a chance
to examine anything.

225
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:15,044
- So really I've got nothing to go on.
- What about foam?

226
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:19,317
Drowning victims are often identified
by a physical reaction known as foam film.

227
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,819
When the body goes into rapid shock,
then responds...

228
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:25,152
with the formation of mucus
around the throat and windpipe?

229
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,621
No. Totally clean.

230
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,420
It sounds like you have a murder to solve.

231
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,932
You think someone murdered Candace
outside the pool...

232
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,434
then dumped her in it
to make it look like a drowning?

233
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,993
It's a theory.

234
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:43,301
Okay, I got to run. But stay close.
I may need you tonight.

235
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,708
I'm so excited.
I knew you'd come to the reunion.

236
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,682
Wouldn't miss it. I was thinking,
let's just you and me go together.

237
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,479
You didn't want to go, did you?

238
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,850
And miss another round of high school?
I'll survive.

239
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,821
Well, I'm going.

240
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,789
- You weren't in our class, Harry.
- I've promised him.

241
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,460
Yeah, but you'd have so much more fun
without him. Trust me.

242
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:10,227
You understand, don't you? We'll catch
a movie or something tomorrow night.

243
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,736
No. But I was so looking forward to this.

244
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,332
Hey, count your blessings, Harrison.
High school sucked.

245
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,307
Hey, can I talk to you a sec?
What are you doing?

246
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,404
This is my big date with Lindsay.

247
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:27,212
Liar. You just want to go
so you can pick a fight with Keith Morgan.

248
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,616
What are you talking about?
There is....

249
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,122
We already went to the reunion,
didn't we?

250
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,421
Consider it a heads up.

251
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,554
You know how annoying it is
to have a sibling with your powers?

252
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,154
You're welcome.

253
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,967
- Tru.
- Hey.

254
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,842
What a surprise. What are you....

255
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,943
How did you know where I live?

256
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,142
You were listed in the Reunion Directory.

257
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,708
Which hasn't come out yet,
but I'm on the committee...

258
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,414
and I helped put it together. Nice building.

259
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,550
It'll do. For now.

260
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,224
I don't mean to be blunt,
but what brings you here?

261
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,759
Candace, you remember
when we used to be friends?

262
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,596
- One reunion and everyone gets weepy.
- Come on.

263
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:20,502
We used to ditch classes together
and talk on the phone all the time.

264
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,904
- We were kind of tight.
- I know.

265
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,404
But I'm through with the past.

266
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:30,573
Because as good as things are for me now,
they're about to get a whole lot better.

267
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,514
- Really? How so?
- I wrote a novel.

268
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:36,020
It's called <i>High SchooI ConfidentiaI.</i>
It's all about life in high school.

269
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,249
No one's seen it yet, but when they do...

270
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,791
it's going to be
this generation's <i>Less Than Zero.</i>

271
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,327
Wow, that's great. I'm so happy for you.

272
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,228
So please don't take this the wrong way...

273
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,193
but you can't go
to the reunion tonight, Candace.

274
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,463
I see.

275
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:55,303
You still have that jealousy problem.
Is that why you came here?

276
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:59,241
To keep me away
so I can't outshine you again?

277
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,847
No. It's just,
reunions can get kind of crazy...

278
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,075
and who knows
what could happen tonight?

279
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,712
I know exactly what will happen.
You'll show up with Linda, or Lindy--

280
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:10,846
Lindsay.

281
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,882
And you'll be wearing something
she picked out for you.

282
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,921
I'm thinking two- year- old black skirt,
faux vintage top.

283
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,729
Thanks for stopping by, Tru.
It's really nice catching up with you.

284
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,378
But I wouldn't miss that reunion tonight
for the world.

285
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:47,082
What's the matter? You seem
so tense. Got the pre- reunion jitters?

286
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,586
I just keep thinking about Candace Aimes.

287
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:53,119
Can you think of anyone who would
still be holding a grudge against her?

288
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:56,292
Strange question. Let me think.

289
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:01,072
- I know. The entire graduating class?
- Not high school. I mean now, today.

290
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,300
Who would still have issues with her?

291
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:06,969
Ronny Clifton might still be upset with her
after what she did to him.

292
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,139
Why, what did she do to him?
You never heard?

293
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,545
After Candace stole Ronny from you,
they got engaged...

294
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,918
and then she left him at the altar,
broke his heart.

295
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,446
- Really?
- Yeah.

296
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:23,650
I guess no one told you because,
well, you know....

297
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,792
Finally. My pants.

298
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,439
- Hi. I have a delivery for--
- Billy!

299
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,738
Tru!

300
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,075
This is....

301
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,939
I haven't seen you for what?
Like five years.

302
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,915
- Yeah.
- Is this for you?

303
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:48,450
- Under my sister's name, yeah.
- $8.

304
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,846
- Are you going to the thing tonight?
- Wouldn't miss it.

305
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,823
You know my favorite part
about these reunions...

306
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,158
is listening to everyone
out- BS- ing each other...

307
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,755
and trying to make themselves sound
big and important.

308
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:01,992
Right.

309
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,826
I'll see you tonight, Tru.

310
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,975
Billy, hi.

311
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,482
That's a nice tie. I didn't know
people were still wearing those...

312
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,143
in this century.

313
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,485
She'll always think I'm a geek.

314
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,788
You know, I shouldn't be telling you this...

315
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,489
but I've developed this software
that's going to revolutionize downloading.

316
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,759
It'll make MP3 players obsolete.

317
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,822
Tru!

318
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,262
Hey Billy.

319
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,649
Tru! My God, it's you!
Hello, Judy!

320
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:55,084
Can you believe it? Everyone here
in one room. It's like we never left.

321
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:58,680
- Have you seen Larry Cutler yet?
- Addicted- to- painkillers Larry? Yeah.

322
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,588
- And Kenny Lewis--
- Gay.

323
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:04,486
- And did you hear about Steve Sabitzsky?
- Fired his dad.

324
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:05,986
How about--

325
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,396
Gillian Kaye, with all that plastic surgery?

326
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,834
And did you know Candace Aimes
could never even swim?

327
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:14,633
It's been so great
catching up with you, Judy.

328
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,934
Ronny, hi.

329
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:23,242
- Tru. Hey. You look great.
- Thanks.

330
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,878
- It's weird, all of us being back here.
- Yeah, no kidding.

331
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,250
You okay seeing Candace again?

332
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,355
It didn't work out. Let's leave it at that.

333
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:36,985
She really hurt you.

334
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:40,293
No one can blame you
if you wanted her to hurt, too.

335
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,766
Slow down, okay? I mean,
what happened with Candace and me...

336
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:47,430
yeah, it hurt. But it's history.
Water under the bridge.

337
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,632
She really broke your heart.

338
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,304
People say I broke your heart.

339
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:55,312
It doesn't make you want to hurt me,
does it?

340
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:07,453
Craig. Hey, it's Tru Davies.

341
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:11,488
Listen, my best friend, Lindsay,
is a really good person.

342
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,927
Awesome.
I know you don't remember her...

343
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,526
but in high school she put a note
in your locker and you never got it.

344
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,729
I don't know why. But just do me a favor.

345
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,968
If she brings it up tonight,
just be nice to her.

346
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,643
Could you do that for me?

347
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,801
I guess I can.

348
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,474
Hey, Tru, you got a minute?

349
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:33,942
I want you to know something.

350
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,852
I'm not some total loser
who works at a dry cleaners'.

351
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,516
- Look, I didn't say anything.
- I know.

352
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,222
You see,
I would have done everything that I said.

353
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:46,262
See, I had all this venture capital lined up.

354
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:49,494
It was cool until the guy pulled the plug
at the last minute.

355
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,832
And then, no more capital to venture with.

356
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:54,997
I'm sorry. Whoever the guy was,
I'm sure he made a huge mistake.

357
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,075
You know who the guy was?

358
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,843
Candace's dad.

359
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,343
- Really?
- Yeah. Nice, huh?

360
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:09,954
Beer, please.

361
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:14,020
You made it. I didn't think you'd show.

362
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,352
It's not like we got anything else going on.

363
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,760
Yeah. Thanks to my sister.

364
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,894
You really wanted to go to that reunion,
didn't you?

365
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,467
You want to know why?

366
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,436
- Lindsay.
- No.

367
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,572
Keith Morgan.
See, this guy used to torture me.

368
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,744
It started out with little swirlies
after gym class.

369
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:40,512
And then it was beatings
on a semi- regular basis.

370
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,111
And now he's back in town.

371
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:48,258
- You wanted to go tonight so you can get--
- Two words: re- venge.

372
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,389
They asked me to transfer
to another school...

373
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,731
- but I figured that I could do more work--
- Do you mind if I cut in?

374
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,794
Tru Davies. What a treat.

375
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,434
Hi, Tru. Great seeing you.
Did you come here stag tonight?

376
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,010
No boyfriend?

377
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:10,439
It's a nice outfit.
Somehow not what I expected.

378
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,917
- Do you mind if I talk to you for a second?
- About what?

379
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,509
Why you didn't want me coming?

380
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,021
Tru tried to convince me
that I shouldn't show...

381
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:21,286
but I told her, high school's over.
She can relax.

382
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,828
Look, there's Larry Whitesman.

383
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:28,593
I have to tell him how good he looks
with the extra weight.

384
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:36,036
- Don't let Candace get to you, Tru.
- She doesn't.

385
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,577
How come
you can't take your eyes off of her?

386
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,174
How about a dance
for an old teacher?

387
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:52,418
Look, maybe it's Candace,
or maybe it's just being back here...

388
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,016
but I can tell there's something
on your mind...

389
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:58,358
and I just want to say that
even though you've graduated...

390
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,921
my office door is still always open to you.

391
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,126
I appreciate it, Mr. Connor.

392
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:19,976
Tru, is there something wrong?
Not if I can help it.

393
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,435
Candace, are you in here?

394
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,604
Candace, watch out!

395
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:54,816
- Dude, this was priceless.
- I've been waiting five years for this.

396
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,515
Come on, get right in there.

397
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,021
- Tru, what are you doing?
- She can't swim.

398
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:09,697
- You could've killed her.
- It was just a prank, okay?

399
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:13,067
Yeah, we thought you hated Candace
more than anyone.

400
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,400
You okay?

401
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:19,102
I think you swallowed some water,
but you'll be all right.

402
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:26,415
- Hey! What the hell is going on here?
- Nothing, Curtis. I mean, Mr. Connor.

403
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:29,814
Yeah, we're just having some fun.
Very mature, guys.

404
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,748
Laugh it up, both of you.

405
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,827
They told me to meet them here.

406
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:43,399
See how funny
you think assault charges are.

407
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,900
You're both witnesses.

408
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,236
Candace, are you okay?

409
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,363
Back off, Tru.

410
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:55,238
It's not like you saved my life or anything.

411
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,278
All right, guys, back inside. Let's go!

412
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:06,817
There's some dryers in the locker
room. You might want to use them.

413
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,392
It's too early.

414
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,964
Morgue.
<i>Davis, it's me.</i>

415
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:20,698
Hey, Tru. How's the reunion?
Everyone still alive?

416
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:24,332
The good news is, I saved Candace
after she got shoved in the pool.

417
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,910
What's the bad news?
<i>It was just a prank.</i>

418
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:30,414
Which means her life is still in danger
and the murder's still on track.

419
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:33,143
Well, maybe the pool prank
killed Candace on day one.

420
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,243
That's impossible. The times don't match.

421
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,289
Candace wasn't in the gym until 9:30
and I found her at 10:00.

422
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:39,721
<i>Something must have changed.</i>

423
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:42,692
What did you do differently tonight
than last night?

424
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,829
Luc! Candace was
talking to him yesterday...

425
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:51,426
and so she couldn't get to the pool.
But he didn't come with me tonight.

426
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,267
<i>That's it. So your invoIvement in events</i>
<i>can change them.</i>

427
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,670
Last night you saved Candace
from humiliation.

428
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,640
<i>Tonight you have to stop her murder.</i>

429
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,110
Unfortunately, you're back to square one
on suspects.

430
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:02,474
<i>Looks Iike it.</i>

431
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,642
Stay in touch, okay?
I might need you. This isn't over.

432
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,814
God, and I was just a little runt back then.

433
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:14,518
And this dude put me through a living hell.
For years!

434
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:19,186
And I have been waiting
since the 10th grade to return the favor.

435
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,390
Tonight was going to be the night, man.
But no!

436
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,828
My sis has got to convince Lindsay
to leave me at home.

437
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,838
Look, I'm sure she had a good reason.

438
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:32,399
Yeah, when you can do what Tru does,
you always have a good reason, right?

439
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,179
What do you mean?
What can your sister do?

440
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,080
Well, you know....
She's always looking after little brother.

441
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:45,618
It's too bad we can't just
crash the reunion. That'd solve everything.

442
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,326
Let's crash.

443
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:58,761
Craig.

444
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:08,206
Hey, Glenn Carpenter.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

445
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,179
Later. Yeah, sure.

446
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,409
Craig Burg.

447
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:13,781
Hi, Lindsay.

448
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,410
You remembered.

449
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:20,554
This may sound a little strange,
but toward the end of senior year...

450
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:24,186
- I left you a note in your locker, and--
- I never got it.

451
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:29,263
But let me tell you something.
If I had gotten a note from you....

452
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:32,394
If a girl as beautiful and charming as you
had given me one...

453
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,529
- I'd be touched.
- You would?

454
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:38,166
Without a doubt. And I would have done
something about it, too.

455
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,608
Who knows where it could've led?

456
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,112
But as it is, I'm married.

457
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:47,042
- Congratulations, Craig. That's great.
- Yeah, I think so.

458
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:51,678
But I'm glad you said something tonight.
It's good to reconnect.

459
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,491
It was so good to see you, Craig.

460
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,125
There you are. I've been looking
for you! I've told everyone.

461
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,222
- Told everyone what?
- Votes for Reunion Queen.

462
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,391
Pass.

463
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,992
About you, Tru. Saving Candace.
They all agree you're a big hero.

464
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,538
<i>But I wish we had BiIIy's pictures.</i>
<i>I was taIking to--</i>

465
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:13,043
I've got something really important to do,
and I'm sorry, but I can't be distracted.

466
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,345
- Tru!
- All right!

467
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,780
Is this a bad time?

468
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,512
I know how eager you were
to have us here tonight.

469
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:22,746
Great.

470
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,119
Hey! What are you doing here?
I didn't think you were coming.

471
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,124
Hey! What are you doing here?
I didn't think you were coming.

472
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:31,424
I wasn't, but then I remembered.
I got some business to take care of.

473
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,626
Sorry about the surprise.

474
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:42,070
It seemed like a good idea
about half an hour ago.

475
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,131
- No, it's fine.
- You sure?

476
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:47,372
- It's just been kind of a crazy night.
- Crazy good, or crazy bad?

477
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:50,003
That's the thing. I don't know yet.
Okay.

478
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,309
<i>Why don't you find me</i>
<i>when you figure it out?</i>

479
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:54,977
I'll be at the bar. Brown jacket.

480
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,321
You know,
I have my own opinion about Candace.

481
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:05,328
I told you. Now is not the best--
You could've let her drown.

482
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:09,656
What? You're kidding, right?
You know, it isn't fair.

483
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:14,232
Everyone always says Candace has things.
She has boyfriends, and she has money...

484
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,797
and looks and popularity.
But Candace doesn't have those things.

485
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,344
- She took them.
- What's that?

486
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:23,079
She took them from people like me.

487
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,941
I could've been Prom Queen,
but Candace took it.

488
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,247
Now, you ask me,
she deserves everything she gets.

489
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:33,313
Let's get some air.
Come on, let's get you out of here.

490
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,688
Why?
<i>Hello.</i>

491
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,522
<i>Can I have your attention, please?</i>

492
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:39,461
<i>We finaIIy have aII the baIIots in</i>
<i>and it's now time to announce...</i>

493
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,658
<i>tonight's CIass of'99</i>
<i>Five Year Reunion Queen.</i>

494
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,961
<i>And tonight our Queen is Tru Davies.</i>

495
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,139
No. You don't understand.
Don't be shy!

496
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,476
<i>I think we'd all Iike to hear a few words.</i>

497
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,692
Excuse me, I've got to go.

498
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,269
Excuse me.

499
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:39,983
Mr. Connor!

500
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,458
Tru. You caught me grading papers.

501
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,620
Why aren't you inside?
I need your help.

502
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:47,096
- What's the trouble?
- I don't have time to explain.

503
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:51,192
I need you to listen. Candace is in danger.
I think Judy's going to hurt her.

504
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,329
I know a lot of old feelings
can get stirred up at these reunions.

505
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:57,272
- But violence? I don't think so.
- Normally, I wouldn't either.

506
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,139
But you're going to have to believe me.

507
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:01,302
I believe that you believe it.

508
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,846
- How can I help?
- Have you seen Candace or Judy?

509
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:06,179
- I haven't, but--
- I need you to do me a favor.

510
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,718
Let's split up. I'll take this wing,
you go that way...

511
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,414
and just keep an eye out
for either of them.

512
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:15,555
- Please don't ask why.
- That'd be two favors, wouldn't it?

513
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:31,968
Judy.

514
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,739
It's not fair, Tru.

515
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:38,614
- Where's Candace?
- I said it's not fair!

516
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,445
Okay, now you're starting to scare me.

517
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:46,748
I can't take it anymore.
It's like high school all over again.

518
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,988
<i>Nothing ever changes.</i>

519
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:55,160
First, Candace is Prom Queen. Now you.

520
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,429
How come it's never my turn?

521
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:08,377
How come girls like Candace always win,
and girls like me always lose?

522
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:11,444
All I can tell you, Judy, is,
things change, I promise.

523
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,882
Now help me out. I need to find Candace.

524
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,818
Why is Candace
so important to everybody?

525
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,385
To you, to Mr. Connor. I'm important, too.

526
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,186
What do you mean, Mr. Connor?

527
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,562
I just saw her, with him.

528
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:31,400
You just saw them together?
Yeah.

529
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,499
Like two minutes ago.

530
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:01,693
I wrote a novel.

531
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,358
It's called <i>High SchooI ConfidentiaI.</i>

532
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,781
So you're sure
no one's seen your novel?

533
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:20,817
It's like I've been telling you, Mr. Connor.
No one's seen it.

534
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,718
- Why do you keep asking me that?
- Just need to be sure.

535
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,348
You told me it was no good,
that it needed lots of work.

536
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,289
Of course I haven't shown it to anyone.

537
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:31,726
I was feeling so good about it,
until I showed it to you.

538
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:36,224
Why'd you want to meet me here?
It's so creepy.

539
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:47,634
I have been trying to write a novel
for years, with no success...

540
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:51,713
watching students like you graduate,
move on, pass me by.

541
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:55,377
I thought you'd be proud of me.
I am.

542
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,449
Your first try, you write a book...

543
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:02,652
that I have been trying to
put to paper for years.

544
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,989
I know my limits, Candace.

545
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,963
The only way
that I will write a book as great as yours...

546
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,936
is if I make it my own.

547
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:16,733
That's impossible.

548
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,544
Not if no one's seen it.

549
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,209
Not if no one knows.

550
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,007
Oh, God.

551
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,056
No one knows.

552
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:36,650
The only way for you to steal
my novel from me--

553
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:40,062
I am so sorry, Candace.

554
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,962
- Tru, what are you doing here?
- I was looking for Candace.

555
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,305
I just wanted to tell her
how much I loved her book.

556
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:56,107
See, the only way this works for you
is if nobody's seen it.

557
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,110
So now you've got a choice.

558
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:01,379
You can kill Candace
and put your name on the book.

559
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,881
But you're gonna have to kill me, too.

560
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:18,761
You won't tell anyone, will you?

561
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:21,930
Not if you resign tomorrow
and turn yourself in.

562
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:26,135
<i>You know, it's a shame.</i>
<i>The schooI's going to Iose a good teacher.</i>

563
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,906
You used to be my favorite, Mr. Connor.

564
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,841
But I guess things change.

565
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,187
My God.

566
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,798
<i>Ladies and gentIemen of the CIass of'99...</i>

567
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:58,774
<i>pIease weIcome back our Queen,</i>
<i>Tru Davies.</i>

568
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,680
That's my sister.

569
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:20,192
<i>Hi, everyone.</i>
<i>For those of you who remember me...</i>

570
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:24,165
<i>you know I'm not too good</i>
<i>at giving speeches. But here goes.</i>

571
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,035
<i>High schooI was a time...</i>

572
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,668
<i>that pretty much sucked for most of us.</i>

573
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:35,371
<i>Let's face it, it was aII about</i>
<i>being picked on or getting Ieft out.</i>

574
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,448
<i>But tonight I think</i>
<i>we get the chance to change that.</i>

575
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:40,779
<i>We can Iet bygones be bygones.</i>

576
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,681
<i>This tiara means a Iot to some peopIe.</i>

577
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:49,855
<i>But it doesn't beIong to me. Judy Rogers.</i>

578
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:54,387
<i>You know everything about everyone</i>
<i>in this entire cIass.</i>

579
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:57,400
<i>And you've been</i>
<i>waiting five years for this.</i>

580
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,935
<i>So that makes you Queen in my book.</i>

581
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:03,336
<i>Why don't you come up here</i>
<i>and remind us how great you are?</i>

582
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:21,817
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>For once, I'm speechIess.</i>

583
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:25,095
Lindsay? Hi. Glenn, again.

584
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:26,485
Hi.

585
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:31,664
This might sound crazy, but there's
something I've always wanted to tell you.

586
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:35,172
I always thought
you were the most beautiful girl in school.

587
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:38,037
And then you left that note in my locker.

588
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:42,709
- I left that note in your locker?
- That note changed my life.

589
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,406
It did?

590
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:47,416
It made me realize
one very important thing.

591
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:52,380
If I couldn't have feelings for you,
I couldn't have feelings for any girl.

592
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,159
Wait a minute.

593
00:39:56,293 --> 00:40:00,491
Are you telling me that my note
made you realize that you're gay?

594
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:04,525
That note made me gay.
And let me tell you something.

595
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:08,465
Come 10th year reunion, that tiara is mine.

596
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,073
God, what a night.

597
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:18,981
My note turned one guy into a liar,
another one gay.

598
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,485
The power of the written word.

599
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:24,077
- And how was your night?
- Typical.

600
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,848
Don't even get me started
on Harrison, either.

601
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,791
My God, Harrison. I totally forgot.

602
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:33,421
He didn't try to pick a fight
with Keith Morgan, did he?

603
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:38,567
- Now I remember you.
- Drinks are up, ladies.

604
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:40,497
They've been like that all night.

605
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:44,371
I thought they were going to fight,
but then Luc just started laughing at them.

606
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,070
Now they're the Three freaking Amigos.

607
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:48,840
Lucky me.

608
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,980
I'll be right back.
There's something I have to take care of.

609
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:00,015
Candace, how you holding up?

610
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,181
I'm fine. Why?

611
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:06,190
I was just wondering.
After the ordeal you went through--

612
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:10,758
- I don't need your pity.
- It's not pity, Candace. It's friendship.

613
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,399
To be honest, I don't need that, either.

614
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:19,733
Candace, we used to be best friends.
I know things change.

615
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:23,469
We're not friends now,
but maybe that could change, too.

616
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:28,316
I know I'd really like that.
What do you say?

617
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,287
Sorry, Tru.

618
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:39,192
Some things change.
Some things never will.

619
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:51,566
Hi.

620
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,477
- I'm glad you're still here.
- Yeah?

621
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,943
- Yeah.
- Then how about a dance?

622
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,484
I thought you'd never ask.

623
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:10,385
So tonight must have
brought back some memories?

624
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:13,430
Yeah. A few.

625
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:25,199
You know who you should take
to the prom? Ronny Clifton.

626
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:29,807
- He's so out of my league.
- No way. He'd be lucky to have you.

627
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,810
- You mean it?
- What are best friends for?

628
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,146
Let's never change, okay?

629
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,848
We'll be wrinkly old best friend ladies
together, forever.
