1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,832
Then they called me
this frat guy...

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:05,996
and I was like,"No, baby. Pay me."

3
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:09,308
Yeah, it's a damn good thing, too.

4
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:12,368
'Cause I was into my boy, Chaz,
for four bills.

5
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,806
You know, I've been thinking
about getting my nipples pierced.

6
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:20,118
- That's great, Harrison.
- Earth to sis.

7
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,949
Have you been listening to me?

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,684
- What's going on?
- Trust me.

9
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:27,352
You don't want to know.
I do want to know.

10
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:30,692
<i>I am aII about wanting to know. Tru?</i>

11
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,236
Tru, what are you doing?

12
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:42,298
What the hell do you think you're doing?

13
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:45,173
I was just....Didn't you see that car
coming right at you?

14
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,713
All day with the questions
and the sneaking around.

15
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,909
- Are you stalking me?
- Ma'am, I swear, I was just trying to help.

16
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,043
Help me write down
your name and number.

17
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,679
I'm sure my attorney
will want to talk to you.

18
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,882
Obviously you'll believe
what you want...

19
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:01,620
- but I just helped you more than you know.
- I don't need your help.

20
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:03,721
<i>I do.</i>

21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,860
I do.

22
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,139
I do.

23
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:17,468
I do.

24
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:20,740
Come in.

25
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,049
What are you....

26
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,191
Help me.

27
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,566
God, what are you doing?

28
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:18,961
We need to talk.

29
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:22,541
We're not really gonna have
this conversation again, are we?

30
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,973
I think we have to.

31
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:29,575
You should've seen yourself the other day.
And the way people were looking at you.

32
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,584
I saved someone's life.
I don't really care what people think.

33
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,782
It's getting out of hand.
And I need a real explanation, okay?

34
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:40,053
Not this crap about do- over days...

35
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,185
and damsels in distress.

36
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:47,697
What you're claiming, it's not possible.
It's not.

37
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,326
And now you're putting yourself
in danger...

38
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,734
and risking your life over people
who don't care...

39
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,035
over something that's not even real.

40
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,632
Come on.

41
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,677
Did you see where the guy
who was here went?

42
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,144
- Nope.
- Sorry.

43
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,944
What kind of person skips out
on a bill of $7. 32?

44
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,644
<i>It comes out of my pay.</i>

45
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,380
Look, we've been over this before.
And you know what?

46
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:11,014
I'm done talking about it.
Obviously nothing I say...

47
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,083
is gonna convince you, so I'm just gonna
have to find a way to show you...

48
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,153
once and for all, this is real.

49
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,931
Come on, don't you people have jobs?

50
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:42,309
Hi, you're here early.
Actually, I just came by...

51
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,789
to see if you wanna grab a bite to eat,
or maybe just hang out.

52
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,859
Hang out? As in me and you?

53
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,397
Yeah. It's just....

54
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,925
Sometimes I feel
like you're the only one who gets me.

55
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:59,630
Who understands
what's going on in my life. My brother....

56
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,570
He still doesn't buy it?
No.

57
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,542
He believes boxing's legit
and Tupac's alive...

58
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:08,012
but he can't seem to wrap his head
around this one. So what do you say?

59
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,015
- Just a half hour?
- Yeah.

60
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,446
Hello?

61
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,546
What?

62
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:19,249
Oh, my God. I'll be right there.
It's my sister.

63
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,225
Oh, man. The ball!

64
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,726
Get it! Come on!

65
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,772
- Meredith, you all right?
- Yeah, I'll get better.

66
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:40,070
- My car, not so much.
- Forget about your car. Let me see.

67
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,243
Are we done?
One minute.

68
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:48,117
- Relax, Mere. Just tell me what happened.
- I had this appointment...

69
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:51,156
running late because of
all the construction on the highway.

70
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:54,887
- Then this guy just pulls out of nowhere.
- Is there anything I can do?

71
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,555
- Do you need me to call someone?
- No, it just....

72
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,655
I missed my appointment.
It doesn't matter.

73
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,530
Let me see.
I'm sure your office will understand.

74
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,263
I got to get my stuff out of my car
before they take--

75
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:08,340
You just finish getting patched up.
I'll take care of it.

76
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,851
Appointments. Right.

77
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,237
Thanks.

78
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,976
Odd part of town for you
to have an appointment.

79
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:54,179
Didn't you used to come down here
to make a different kind of deal?

80
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,385
Yes. Used to.

81
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:01,823
I really don't appreciate the implication
that this had anything to do with drugs.

82
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,187
Look, sorry, Mere. It's just....

83
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:08,025
- Don't be afraid to ask for help.
- I am not afraid to ask for help.

84
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,967
I called you after the accident, didn't I?

85
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:23,108
Is everything okay with your sister?
Yeah, maybe.

86
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,480
Honestly, I don't know anymore.

87
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,144
My God!
Yeah, I know.

88
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,286
Nicole Simms.
Shot by an unknown assailant.

89
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,317
On her wedding day.

90
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,355
Time of death: between 7:00 and 7:30.

91
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:42,424
Actually might have made it,
but she bled to death in the chapel.

92
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,337
Ambulance was held up by construction
on the highway.

93
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,208
- Who would do this?
- Don't know.

94
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:54,379
Maybe it was random, or maybe
somebody didn't want her to get married.

95
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:58,508
Get started on the standards,
I'll go grab the x- rays. I'll be right back.

96
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,908
Can I help you?

97
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,817
Sorry, that snow
just came out of nowhere.

98
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:39,016
Snow? Here, let me get you something
to dry off with.

99
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,082
No, it's okay. I just....

100
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,424
My....

101
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,996
I think my....

102
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,573
We were supposed to get married today.

103
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,007
And I think they brought her here.

104
00:07:58,711 --> 00:07:59,678
Yeah.

105
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,714
Could I get a couple of minutes?

106
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,353
Um, I never, uh,

107
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,348
I never got a chance to say goodbye.

108
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:20,198
For what it's worth,
I know what you're going through.

109
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,398
Sorry for your loss.

110
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,369
Thanks.

111
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,705
Um. Can I, um,

112
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,436
Can I see her?

113
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,111
Yeah.

114
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,661
I'll just be right through here.

115
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,815
Nicole.

116
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,232
Good news.

117
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:32,429
I finally got the cheesy chomps
that I ordered, so that....

118
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:35,803
Why aren't you running standards?
I gotta start the autopsy soon...

119
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,208
and the Sheriff's Department
needs the bullet for their investigation.

120
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,874
The victim's fiancé came in.
He just wanted to say goodbye.

121
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,043
Where's he waiting? I'll talk to him.

122
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:49,178
Actually, he's in Standards with her.

123
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,155
You know that's against the rules.

124
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,555
Yeah, but can't the rules
be broken a little?

125
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,424
- What's the harm in--
- Tru, until a case is closed...

126
00:09:56,495 --> 00:10:01,023
- the dead are our responsibility.
- Davis, there's also a live person in there.

127
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,992
You take great care of the dead.
What about the living?

128
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,605
Excuse me.

129
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,007
What are you doing?

130
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,877
- All right, I can explain.
- Tru, call security, please.

131
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,646
No, you stay. You stay where you are.

132
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,747
- Oh, my God.
- Listen.

133
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,987
Whatever it is you want,
you don't have to hurt anybody to get it.

134
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,052
- You don't understand.
- Then help me understand.

135
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,826
You're in a lot of pain right now,
but we can deal with it.

136
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,891
Just relax. Davis, don't.

137
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,137
Don't.

138
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,473
No! Davis!

139
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,437
My God! Talk to me! Davis!

140
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,181
You are not leaving me, you understand?

141
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,239
Get up.

142
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,184
Get up, now!

143
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,652
- You'd better pray he doesn't die.
- I did not want to shoot.

144
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:02,292
Look, you have to help me, now!

145
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,589
I will never do anything to help you.

146
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,127
That's too bad.

147
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,210
Help me.

148
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,571
We just saw each other yesterday.
Come on, we need to talk.

149
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,509
Tru.

150
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,768
Are you all right?

151
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,341
I don't know yet.

152
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,852
I know you don't believe
half the things I tell you...

153
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,451
but let's just say
yesterday was a real bad day.

154
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,655
Yeah. Tell me something I don't know.

155
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,730
Watching your sister dive tackle
a total stranger.

156
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,769
Not your yesterday. My yesterday.

157
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:22,035
Look, this is getting out of hand.
And I want a real explanation.

158
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,376
Not this crap about do- over days...

159
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,241
and damsels in distress.

160
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,138
Tru?

161
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,244
- And what is this?
- Your to- do list.

162
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:39,450
"Diner, 1 1:20. Bring $7. 32."
What the hell is this?

163
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,552
If something were to happen to me,
I need to know that you understood why.

164
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:50,198
The only way for you to finally accept
what I do, is for you to do it yourself.

165
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:54,833
- What do I get out of this?
- Be where I tell you, when I tell you...

166
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,606
and by the end of the day,
you'll have your answer.

167
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,385
So I'm guessing this is one of those days.

168
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,051
Since it's not your shift and you're here.

169
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,860
It's a do- over day.

170
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,093
What have we got?

171
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,605
What?

172
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:31,109
- It's good to see you, Davis.
- It's nice to see you, too.

173
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,509
- I'm just really glad you're here.
- Okay.

174
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,945
You do realize I work here, don't you?
Who's Nicole Simms?

175
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:45,180
She's getting married today. Or trying to.
Gets shot in the chest and bleeds out...

176
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:48,522
- before the ambulance can get to her.
- Now you find out who did it?

177
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:52,121
That's the thing. I think I know this time.
It's her fiancé.

178
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:55,928
- How do you know that?
- I saw him. He came here.

179
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:01,436
- What, to the morgue? What for?
- He was tampering with the body.

180
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,566
He must have been
trying to conceal evidence.

181
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,372
You know,
nab the bullet before the cops could.

182
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,777
So, he was here when she asked for help?
Was I here?

183
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,817
- Of course I was here, I'm always here.
- You were here.

184
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,378
What aren't you telling me?

185
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,718
- Davis, I'm sorry, I really got to....
- Right.

186
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,489
Somebody out there needs to be saved.

187
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,029
Something like that.

188
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,205
What do you want me to say?

189
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,433
"Yes" will work.
I'd be willing to take a"fine."

190
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,238
You seriously thought
I would just give you my car?

191
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,508
In some remote cultures,
siblings are known to help one another.

192
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,812
What if you got in an accident?
My insurance premium would increase.

193
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,979
I'll have it back by tonight,
in one piece, I promise.

194
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,352
Look, I'd love to help you out,
I really would.

195
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:54,620
But I have an appointment across town
with a client this afternoon.

196
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:55,853
I need my car.

197
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,657
Didn't you used to come down here
to make a different kind of deal?

198
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,033
This appointment wouldn't be
for something else besides work, right?

199
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,600
Tru, look, no more games today, okay?
I have a staff meeting.

200
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,847
How about this?
You can have the car tomorrow.

201
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,045
Call me and we'll set it up.

202
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,286
Tomorrow's too late.

203
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,791
For both of us.

204
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,205
Yes, you did.
You said you wanted him at your table.

205
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,909
Hold on a minute. Hi.

206
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,850
Hi. I'm looking for Nicole.

207
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,822
- And if you found her, you would be?
- Tru Davies. Old friends.

208
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,727
Ma? I'm gonna call you back.
<i>No, I need--</i>

209
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,495
I have a question about tonight.
Are you here for the wedding, too?

210
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,294
I hope so, I'm in it.

211
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,995
- A groomsman?
- Actually, I'm the groom.

212
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,438
Wait, you're marrying
Nicole Simms tonight?

213
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,268
Yeah, that's the plan.

214
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,205
We were supposed to get married today.

215
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,905
Right, of course.
So you're here for the wedding?

216
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,107
I don't remember your name
from the guest list.

217
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,673
Yeah, I'm not on it.
I'm just here from out of town.

218
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:26,979
I wanted to wish her luck.

219
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,816
Nicole and the troops are all downtown
at some nail shop.

220
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,584
Do you know which one?
It might be fun to surprise her.

221
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,683
It's on Fifth.

222
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,387
- Hands On.
- Great.

223
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,427
Could you just tell her that I miss her?

224
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,627
This whole tradition of me
not seeing her all day....

225
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,534
Just tell her it's killing me, okay?

226
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,639
Yeah. Hello?

227
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,845
- She can't sing.
- I can't stop her.

228
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:58,883
- She's gonna be my mother- in- law.
- No, she can't sing.

229
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,851
She might get up there
and open her mouth...

230
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,912
but what comes out is gonna be like
something from <i>WiId Kingdom.</i>

231
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,719
Another decision.
God, I'm gonna explode.

232
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,995
Go with sheer. French tips are played out.

233
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,595
Thank you. That may have seemed
like nothing, but I'm grateful.

234
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:20,069
- Big day?
- Long day. It's exciting, but exhausting.

235
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:23,164
- I just can't wait to get my life back.
- Good luck with that.

236
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,607
I've got three words for you.
Thank- you notes.

237
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,008
I should've eloped.

238
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,445
Maybe someone didn't want her
to get married.

239
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,883
A friend once said
the hardest part about getting married...

240
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,250
is telling the guy she dated in college.

241
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:40,189
The guy I dated in college beat me to it.
He got married last year.

242
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:45,057
You mean there's not one boy out there
in a particularly bad mood today?

243
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,029
Justin? Justin Burke?

244
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:50,190
Stop it. He hasn't thought twice about me.

245
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,702
Only a guy still hooked...

246
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,534
would buy you something
off your Perry and White registry...

247
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,471
when he's not even
invited to the wedding.

248
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,271
Okay. Point taken.

249
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:01,710
Luckily, after tonight,
I'll only have one guy to worry about.

250
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,022
"The diner, 1 1:20. Bring $7. 32."

251
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:21,354
Come on.

252
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,698
What kind of person skips out
on a bill for $7. 32?

253
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,838
<i>It comes out of my pay.</i>

254
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,139
- Did she put you up to this?
- Excuse me?

255
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,575
My sister.

256
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:37,674
Tell her she's gonna have to do
better than that, okay?

257
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,148
Nice work, though.

258
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,744
Keep the change.

259
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,753
Hi. I'm hoping you can help me out.

260
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:49,658
My boss had me purchase a wedding gift,
and I think I blew it.

261
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,026
I gave you guys the wrong return address.

262
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,691
If something goes wrong, it's my ass.

263
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,826
Would it be too much to ask
for you to check the files?

264
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,736
Yeah, thanks. His name's Justin Burke.

265
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,239
Where the hell are....

266
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,016
Steve, have you seen my keys?
No, I haven't.

267
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,179
Tru, tell me you didn't.

268
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,223
Just call me a cab!

269
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,503
If it's important, I'm out back!

270
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,578
Sorry to bother you.
It's fine.

271
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,505
This stuff gets everywhere.
Can I help you?

272
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,210
I was hoping I could help you.
I'm a new neighbor...

273
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,550
and I actually have the same
house number as you a few blocks over.

274
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:53,250
Anyway, a couple of days ago,
I got a package with a"Return to Sender."

275
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:56,419
I think it was supposed to come here
to a Justin Burke.

276
00:19:56,495 --> 00:20:00,727
That's my boyfriend. This is his place.
I just try to make it livable.

277
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,367
Is he around or....
He's still at work...

278
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:07,462
but he usually comes home for lunch.
Actually, he should be home any minute.

279
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,064
Do you mind me asking you
where the package is from?

280
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:13,542
- I think it was Perry and White.
- That figures.

281
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,838
His ex- girlfriend's getting married.

282
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,417
Is that weird, or....

283
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,750
It's like you'd expect.

284
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,381
Since he heard about the wedding,
he's been a little bit off.

285
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,391
I'm sure it's nothing.

286
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,555
Speaking of....Right on schedule.

287
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,862
<i>Now you can teII him yourseIf.</i>

288
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:49,475
Actually, you know what? I'm late.
I really got to....Thanks for your help.

289
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:07,362
- What was that about?
- A delivery or something.

290
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:11,558
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. I just....

291
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,401
Do me a favor. When you're done here,
come inside for a minute.

292
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,672
I want to talk about something.
Sure.

293
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,814
So I took off.
I didn't know what else to do.

294
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:30,514
He lied. He's not the fiancé.
He's a bitter ex. Not to mention a cop.

295
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,920
At least you found the bride.

296
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,857
All you have to do is convince her
to call off the wedding.

297
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:38,589
That isn't the issue. Stopping the guy is.
I don't know if I can do that.

298
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:42,361
- You've done it before.
- I've failed before. I can't fail this time.

299
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:45,494
Tru, what is going on?
What happened yesterday?

300
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:47,160
I told you.

301
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:49,797
No, you're working harder
at avoiding my questions...

302
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,741
- than saving this girl.
- What do you want me to say, Davis?

303
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,073
The truth!

304
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,852
This guy...

305
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,789
I told you he came here
to cover his tracks.

306
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,957
By trying to extract the bullet.

307
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,660
But what I didn't tell you is...

308
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,030
we walked in on him...

309
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:18,926
and he pulled a gun.

310
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:21,503
In here?

311
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,465
Oh, my God, what happened?

312
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,244
He shot at me.

313
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:31,876
But the day rewound before I could....
Look, I'll be fine.

314
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,748
- But you need to get out of here.
- A guy came in here...

315
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,015
and shot at you
and you want me to leave?

316
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,250
What are you not telling me?

317
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,520
He shot you, Davis.

318
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:45,994
He shot me?

319
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,235
Did I die?

320
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:58,475
I don't know.

321
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:17,327
So you're telling me that in a couple
of hours from now, I could be dead.

322
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,661
Davis, we don't have time for this.
The longer you stay here...

323
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:24,828
the better the chance it'll happen again.
I want you to go to my apartment.

324
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:28,764
Look, if I can't change what happens,
at least I can rearrange the players.

325
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:32,776
Just take these, please, and go there.
But what about you?

326
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,074
I have to warn the bride. You know that.

327
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,310
I also know she's the reason
a guy came in here with a gun.

328
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:42,217
I'll be fine, okay?
I'll meet you back at my place, I promise.

329
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:45,846
Tru. Thank you.

330
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:47,953
For what?

331
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,119
For telling me the truth.

332
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:59,869
Those are Gerber daisies.
I didn't order Gerber daisies.

333
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:03,363
Are you telling me
it's too late to change them?

334
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:06,774
She's in the hall and can't decide
between <i>Some Enchanted Evening...</i>

335
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:10,076
or <i>Time of My Life.</i> She wants to sing you
the first verse of each.

336
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,582
That's just perfect.

337
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,379
- How could this day get any worse?
- Nicole, hi.

338
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,820
- Do you have a minute?
- No, not really.

339
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,619
Aren't you the girl from--
The nail place, yeah.

340
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:24,560
I wasn't completely honest.
Look, I know your ex, Justin.

341
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,490
Okay.

342
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:31,162
I know how he still feels about you,
and what he's willing to do...

343
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:34,466
- to keep this wedding from happening.
- What is she talking about?

344
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:37,804
I have no idea.
Look, you say you know Justin?

345
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:40,344
So do I.
And I know he would never do anything...

346
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:44,075
to hurt me like that. And I also know
I'm not gonna let some stranger...

347
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,549
come in here and screw up my day.

348
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,619
I have family for that.

349
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,915
Can you find your own way out
or do you need a hand?

350
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,587
I got it.
If you want her to make it to the"I do's"...

351
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,290
you'd better keep Justin away from her.

352
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,201
Someone's gonna need
my help. Yeah.

353
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,977
Hi. You probably
need some help, don't you?

354
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,280
- No.
- Come on. Give me your arm...

355
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,322
- and let's get this over with.
- Don't touch me!

356
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,422
What about this, lady?

357
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,825
Oh, man.

358
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,355
<i>The baII!</i>

359
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,692
Come on!

360
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,063
Hey.

361
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,498
You need this?

362
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,039
Thanks.

363
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,607
You're welcome.

364
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,613
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for hours...

365
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:00,817
- and this guy--
- Davis, I'm fine. Look at me, one piece.

366
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:05,087
- How about you?
- I'm okay.

367
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,596
When you say you're okay....
I'm lying.

368
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:15,164
So you really don't know
what happened after he shot me, if I....

369
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,071
No. That's just it. It hasn't happened yet.

370
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,612
So we're gonna make sure
it doesn't happen again.

371
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,513
I've warned the necessary parties,
now all I have to do...

372
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,051
is get to Justin
before he gets to the chapel.

373
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:29,416
- Any idea how?
- That's the thing.

374
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,921
He's a cop. Not to mention armed.

375
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,153
So, short of knocking him out
and stashing him in a locked closet...

376
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:37,820
- I'm running low on ideas.
- I may have one.

377
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,592
Scientific knowledge
always bests physical strength.

378
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:42,496
How do you think
I got through high school?

379
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,626
- This helps me how?
- Knock him out, yes.

380
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,194
But pharmaceutically.
You want him incapacitated...

381
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:50,172
- two words: zinc sulfate.
- Zinc sulfate.

382
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:54,945
That's just gonna make him puke.
For hours. Good idea.

383
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,880
Not that I'm crazy about you
being alone with him in a room...

384
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,885
- but it will buy you some time. If he's--
- Busy, he can't shoot Nicole or you.

385
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,181
Where do I find some?

386
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:05,620
I have a friend at County
who may not mind--

387
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:09,057
Give me a name and a number.
I'll go get the pills.

388
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,789
And listen.
This isn't just about me and Nicole.

389
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:16,967
- He shot three people yesterday, so Tru--
- Don't worry. I will.

390
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,221
I hear you're the man to see.

391
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,691
Well, that depends.

392
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,764
Gonna make it worth my while?

393
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:13,821
What are you....Are you ripping me off?

394
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,722
I'm talking to you!

395
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:23,064
Stupid girl. You want something from me?

396
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,703
I want what I paid for.

397
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,338
You'll get it when you get it.

398
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:46,887
Dispatch called.
Said Nicole was looking for you.

399
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,051
She wants to meet you here
before the wedding.

400
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,823
- Nicole?
- Something you want to tell me?

401
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:07,638
Justin.

402
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:13,408
Nicole's just running late,
so she sent me to give you a heads up.

403
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:16,852
- Who are you?
- Just a bridesmaid fulfilling her duty.

404
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,313
You look familiar.

405
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,791
I am one of Nicole's friends,
and you did date Nicole.

406
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,125
The chances are our paths have crossed.

407
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:28,597
Yeah. Right. Probably, I guess.

408
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:38,070
I'm still a little thrown by her call.
Do you know why she wanted to see me?

409
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:42,079
Honestly, I think she's a little worried
that you're still bent...

410
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:46,049
about the whole breakup,
and that you might do something about it.

411
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,081
- Tonight.
- Are you serious?

412
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:51,213
The only thing I'd do is say thanks.
To hear she was marrying...

413
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,416
turned out to be a serious wake- up call.

414
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:57,154
- What do you mean?
- If she's willing to stop playing games...

415
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:00,163
and commit, she must really love this guy.

416
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:06,604
I just hope I'll feel that strong someday.

417
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,663
It's getting warm. Do you mind?
Sure.

418
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:21,477
You're not wearing your gun.
But you're a cop, right?

419
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,453
I'm a cop, off duty.
I only carry it when I'm on the job.

420
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:27,150
You say you never carry your gun
when you're not working?

421
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,625
No. Some guys do, but not me.

422
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:32,026
<i>When I'm off duty, I'm off duty.</i>

423
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,161
- It wasn't you.
- What?

424
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:38,168
You know what? I've got to go. God.

425
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,033
That's okay.
I'm sorry.

426
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:43,005
No, it's okay.
Are you sure that Nicole's gonna come?

427
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:46,338
Yeah. And I'm sure
she would want you to wait right here.

428
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,978
When I left Justin, it was 6:40.

429
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:54,280
<i>He was Iooking forward to seeing NicoIe,</i>
<i>and he didn't have his gun.</i>

430
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,343
He couldn't have been the one
that shot her--

431
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,219
Someone else must've pulled the trigger.
I don't know who.

432
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,485
Then why does he go to the morgue
to cover it up?

433
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:05,359
I don't know. But there won't be
anything to cover up if I can find Nicole--

434
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,227
- Tru?
- My God, Nicole!

435
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:16,540
Somebody help!

436
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:18,942
God!
What happened?

437
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,070
I don't know. I just found her like this.
What are you doing here?

438
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,171
Look, I'm here to help.

439
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,241
Alive. Barely.

440
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:29,752
- Call 91 1.
- Did you see anyone come in here?

441
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:32,381
No, it's early.
Most of the guests aren't even here yet.

442
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:36,188
- My God! Nicole!
- The ambulance will be here any minute.

443
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,553
The ambulance was held up
by construction.

444
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,256
She bled to death in the chapel.

445
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,800
The ambulance isn't gonna
make it in time. We need to--

446
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,393
No! You're not touching her!
Nobody moves her!

447
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:49,735
What about the police?
Hasn't anybody called the police?

448
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,900
- Give me a phone.
- Listen to me!

449
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,070
There's construction on the highway.
The EMTs will never make it.

450
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:58,171
If we don't get her to a doctor,
neither will Nicole.

451
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:03,151
Please, we can't afford to wait.
Help me get her to a car.

452
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:06,019
But the cars are all blocked
by the catering trucks.

453
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:08,058
- Not mine.
- What about her parents?

454
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:11,357
If the family has a problem,
they can find me at the County Hospital.

455
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,657
I'll be saving their daughter.

456
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:20,728
Hold on! You're gonna make it.
Come on. Nicole?

457
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,636
Come on!

458
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:30,680
<i>HeIIo?</i>
<i>I couIdn't stop it.</i>

459
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,773
Someone shot Nicole, and she looks bad.

460
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,978
- Don't know if she'll make it.
- How close are you to the hospital?

461
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:39,387
Not close enough! Wait, who's on duty
at the morgue right now?

462
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,017
- I don't think that's--
- Someone has to know what to do.

463
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,561
I'm only two blocks away.
It might be her only chance.

464
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,096
- Okay, I'll meet you there.
- No!

465
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,962
I spent the whole day keeping you safe.
You won't go back...

466
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:51,001
- to where you got shot!
- That was yesterday.

467
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:53,094
Today is yesterday! Davis!
<i>Bye, Tru.</i>

468
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,167
Davis! Damn it!

469
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:04,042
Help! Gardez! Anyone?

470
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:08,511
- I told you not to come here!
- You say how much you appreciate...

471
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:11,350
having someone help you.
Let me help you.

472
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,259
If not, let me at least help her.

473
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,088
- I locked all the doors.
- We've got to do this quick...

474
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,690
- and get out of here.
- What's this?

475
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,668
- Dried blood.
- I don't think so.

476
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:28,467
I can't tell what, though.
Lily pollen.

477
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:32,300
- What, from her bouquet?
- No. Those were Gerber daisies.

478
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,977
Then how did it get on her dress?

479
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,742
This stuff gets everywhere.
Can I help you?

480
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,786
Justin left his gun at home.
The only other person...

481
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,118
who would have had access to it
is his girlfriend.

482
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,555
I had the right motive,
just the wrong person.

483
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,558
I find it so interesting...

484
00:33:57,635 --> 00:34:01,127
that you broke up with me
on the day Nicole gets married.

485
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,000
This is about you and me.

486
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,979
It doesn't have anything to do with her.

487
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,542
Well, not anymore.

488
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,382
What are you doing with that?

489
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:23,491
I shot her.

490
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:27,458
Nicole?

491
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,292
Amazing how she's always
the first woman on your mind.

492
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:36,031
- Why would you do that?
- It was so easy for you...

493
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,569
just to end things.

494
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,101
Aly, you didn't have to--
Kill her?

495
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:47,376
- I didn't, Justin. You did.
- Oh, my God.

496
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,149
She's at the morgue by now.

497
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,224
But I didn't do it.

498
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,254
<i>It's my word against yours.</i>

499
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:04,391
It's your gun. Your bullet. Your motive.

500
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,129
The evidence is all there.

501
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:12,168
Somebody just has to find it.

502
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,323
How we doing?
With us.

503
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,792
Okay. I think we're ready.
Okay.

504
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:34,229
I'll assist you.
I'm not doing this. You are.

505
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:38,428
- What? You're the doctor.
- I know. I can't work on live people.

506
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,801
- They freak me out.
- Are you kidding?

507
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:44,103
Why do you think I work here?
Nobody chooses this job.

508
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:47,939
It's gonna be fine. I know what to do.
I just can't do it without dry heaving.

509
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:51,276
You can do this, I know you can.
I'll be right here.

510
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:55,183
- Actually, I'll be right here.
- Okay, what's first?

511
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:58,347
You need to isolate the entry wound.
Do you think you can do that?

512
00:35:58,422 --> 00:35:59,787
I think so.

513
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:06,160
Careful. Given the subatmospheric
pressure in the cavity...

514
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,494
debris might have caused infection.

515
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,960
How's the internal bleeding?

516
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,731
- Pretty bad.
- Okay, you need to seal off any gushers...

517
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:19,606
and decrease the level of blood loss.
Not that one.

518
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,402
The one next to
the hydrogen needle.

519
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,849
Okay, that worked. Now what?

520
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,321
I want you to get out of here right now.

521
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,364
If I leave, Nicole dies.

522
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:54,141
Who are you? I thought you said
you were a friend of Nicole's?

523
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,372
I lied.

524
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:01,246
Look, I came to say goodbye.

525
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,547
You came here for the bullet.

526
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,027
- Is she still alive?
- Look, we both know...

527
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:14,087
that you didn't shoot her.
Yeah, but can you prove it?

528
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:17,760
Because the bullet came from my gun!
Everybody knows I still love Nicole...

529
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:21,304
and there were no witnesses.
Now, I need the evidence.

530
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:25,470
And the evidence is inside of her.
Davis, don't!

531
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,338
If you move, he'll shoot you.

532
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:33,208
Justin, there is a witness.

533
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:36,008
And she's lying here on this table.

534
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:41,114
<i>She's the onIy one who can testify</i>
<i>that AIyssa shot her, not you.</i>

535
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:46,289
Look, we can save her, and you.
But you've got to give us the time.

536
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:51,226
<i>Right now, you've got a choice.</i>

537
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,532
Your life goes one of two ways.

538
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,402
Which is it gonna be?

539
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:11,387
All right, where do I go from here?

540
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,987
You might have to bag her.
How's her breathing?

541
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,963
It sounds okay.
Good.

542
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:25,594
Looks like her lungs didn't collapse.
That's a good sign.

543
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:49,592
How was your day?
Well, I'll be honest. Nice effort.

544
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:54,689
You know, the waitress
and the little kid with the ball. Very clever.

545
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:56,829
But I'm sorry. Game over.

546
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,133
'Cause it ain't gonna snow out of nowhere.

547
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,236
Let me see your watch.

548
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:08,272
- Yeah, that's two minutes fast.
- So?

549
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:11,414
Look outside.

550
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,322
Unbelievable.

551
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:24,817
I have...

552
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:29,429
First I thought you were messing with me
with the card....

553
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:34,093
But there's no getting around this.

554
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:40,974
I don't understand. I can't comprehend...

555
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,981
but I do believe you now.

556
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,685
That's all I wanted.

557
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:52,550
You have no idea what this means to me.

558
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,993
- Thank you.
- No.

559
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:00,928
Thank you.

560
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,567
Do you know what this does for me?

561
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,699
You're omniscient.

562
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:11,538
You're like the ultimate bodyguard.

563
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:14,704
- That's not--
- It's like a free pass.

564
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:17,872
- If anybody steps to me, you can--
- No, that's not what this is.

565
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,449
Hold on a sec.

566
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:26,315
Hello? Chaz! What's up?

567
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,856
Yeah, I got your money. I'll be honest.

568
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,161
I don't think I'm gonna make it tonight.

569
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,399
No. Look, I'll call you.

570
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:44,232
- You owe him money?
- Yeah. But what's the rush?

571
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,877
- I'll get it to him.
- Harrison, you can't just do that.

572
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,972
If you don't pay him....
I won't always be there to help you.

573
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,315
But of course you will, Tru.

574
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:57,743
You're my sister.

575
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,031
Justin turned himself in,
and they arrested his girlfriend...

576
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,578
- based on what he told the cops.
- And Nicole?

577
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,147
I sent her to County. She's stable.

578
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:27,514
Her parents just called
and they wanted to thank the doctor.

579
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,143
That's nice.

580
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,012
They meant you.

581
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,153
She wouldn't have made it without you.

582
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,990
And neither would I.

583
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,360
It's kind of funny...

584
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:46,500
this is the second time
that someone's saved my life.

585
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,603
Really, what happened?

586
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,916
Sorry. Hello?

587
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:04,717
Hey, Tru. It's me.

588
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:07,750
<i>Meredith, are you aII right?</i>

589
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:10,688
Tru.

590
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:15,728
Tru.

591
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:18,568
Help me.

592
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:23,235
Hold tight, sweetie, I'll be right there.

593
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,500
It's my sister.
It's okay. Go ahead.

594
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:30,572
It's been a long day, or two.
We'll discuss it another time.

595
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:31,739
Okay.
