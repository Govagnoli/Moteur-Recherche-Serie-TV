1
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,358
So you finally did it.

2
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:39,734
Thirty- nine straight days at the morgue,
and you finally took one off.

3
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:43,037
- I had to see it for myself.
- I was this close to the record.

4
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,272
I thought that we could celebrate
over breakfast.

5
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,486
This is pathetic.
50 people coming here tonight...

6
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,419
and all I have in the way of munchies...

7
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,855
is a bottle of olives
and a box of baking soda.

8
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:01,689
I don't get this. You moved
into this place six months ago...

9
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:04,252
and you're throwing
a house warming party tonight?

10
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,628
What can I say? I've been busy.

11
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,328
So, are you nervous?
About what?

12
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:15,434
Tonight. Meeting my friends
for the first time. My brother.

13
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:18,306
They're going to study my every move
and report back to you.

14
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,575
- Why would that make me nervous?
- You'll be great.

15
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,720
Hello?
<i>Tru? </i>

16
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,350
Hey, it's me. Come on,
it's only been a couple of months...

17
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,156
- don't tell me you've already forgotten?
- Mark.

18
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,594
<i>Look, I know</i>
<i>what happened was my fauIt...</i>

19
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,261
<i>and you have every reason to hate me. </i>

20
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:49,068
But I just can't stop thinking about you,
Tru, and I want you back.

21
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,071
<i>Hey, are you stiII there? </i>

22
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,144
Yeah, but now really isn't a good time.

23
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,211
Maybe I could come by later?
We could talk, face to face.

24
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:03,821
See, here's the thing.

25
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,154
What you want really doesn't matter.
Know why?

26
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,659
'Cause you're the one who cheated.

27
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:11,388
And it was the biggest mistake of my life,
Tru, and I know that now.

28
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,228
Yeah, well, you should've known it then.

29
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:18,902
Besides, I've met someone new.
And he's great.

30
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:22,371
Please, Tru, it'll never happen again.

31
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:23,903
You're right, it won't.

32
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,805
<i>I got to go, Mark. </i>

33
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,023
Help me.

34
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:11,122
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah. Why?

35
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,716
You looked a little freaked
when you answered the phone.

36
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,988
I thought maybe it was bad news.

37
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:21,193
Well, the truth is that was my ex.
And he wanted to see me.

38
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,971
I can't say that's the answer
I was expecting, but....

39
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:29,672
Hey, whatever you need.
You and I have only been out a few times--

40
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,209
I told him no.

41
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,112
Even better.

42
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,177
I'm sorry. It's weird.
I shouldn't have told you.

43
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,242
No, I'm glad you did.

44
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:46,518
If you and I can't be honest
with each other, what hope do we have?

45
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,566
You're probably wondering
why I asked you to meet me here today.

46
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,363
- I meet you here all the time.
- Whatever.

47
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,204
It's Lindsay.

48
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,468
Ever since we hooked up,
I can't stop thinking about her.

49
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:08,204
- You're kidding me, right?
- Crazy as it sounds, I'm not.

50
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:13,184
You know me. I can't stand Lindsay.
I never could.

51
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,922
And, yet, she just keeps
popping into my head.

52
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,317
It's confusing the hell out of me.

53
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,088
And you're telling me this now because....

54
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,322
You're meeting her
to shop for your party, right?

55
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:29,892
I thought maybe you could feel her out.
See where her head's at. You know?

56
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,168
Vis- á- vis yours truly.

57
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,134
Come on. Help a brother out.

58
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:40,770
Look, all I'm looking for
is a simple yes or no.

59
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:43,539
<i>Maybe. </i>

60
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,584
Maybe you're interested
in my brother?

61
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,882
He's cute, don't get me wrong.

62
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,784
He went all weird after we made out,
like he was embarrassed or something.

63
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:55,259
- Typical guy stuff.
- He was probably just nervous.

64
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,922
Still, post- hookup, you give a girl a call.

65
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:01,660
You know, maybe some flowers.
Make the girl feel special.

66
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,035
We don't need that.

67
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:09,802
Got to cut the limes with something.
Besides, it's on sale.

68
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,602
Okay.

69
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,545
Oh, my God, Pez. I forgot Pez.

70
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:16,879
You and your candy.

71
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:20,476
I just love those little dispensers.
They're so kitschy.

72
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:26,850
Hello, Davis.

73
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,656
For the last time, yes.

74
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,793
But what if a dead body comes in
and asks for help? What do I do?

75
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,167
First, they don't talk to you,
they talk to me.

76
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,205
Okay, but--

77
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,434
Also, they don't ask for help
every night. It's not how it works.

78
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,976
Just come in for five minutes.

79
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,239
If no one asks for help,
then you can go home.

80
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,507
<i>Did you hear what I said? </i>

81
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,072
I worked eight days this week, literally.

82
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,950
- But what I'm trying to say is that--
- Davis, I need a break.

83
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,023
Okay. So I'll see you tomorrow?

84
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,720
I'll see you then. Bye.

85
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,463
Chips, dips, a whole lot of beer.

86
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,493
Looks like somebody's having a party.

87
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,205
What's wrong?

88
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,971
Nothing, I'm just surprised
to see you here, is all.

89
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,033
Real coincidence.

90
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,842
I live three blocks from here,
remember that?

91
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,212
This is my market where I shop.

92
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:28,249
- I'm not following you or anything.
- Okay.

93
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:33,858
Since I have you here,
I just wanted to apologize...

94
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:37,890
because I feel like I came on strongly
this morning. It was rude.

95
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,228
That's fine.
Anyway...

96
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,534
it was nice to see you.

97
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:46,763
Yeah.

98
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:56,314
I still can't believe
you had a stalker moment and I missed it.

99
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:57,906
It wasn't a stalker moment.

100
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,976
Mark and I just happened to be
in the same place at the same time.

101
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,645
That's what stalkers do.

102
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,747
They just happen to be in your market...

103
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,224
and then they just happen
to follow you home...

104
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,729
and then they just happen to
chop your head off and seal it in a baggie.

105
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,765
Linds!
I'm just saying.

106
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,024
First the phone call, and now this?

107
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,165
Hello?

108
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,604
<i>What'd she say? </i>
<i>And teII me everything. </i>

109
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:25,303
<i>ActuaIIy, I'm pretty satisfied</i>
<i>with my Iong- distance pIan. </i>

110
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,608
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

111
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,177
It means you should maybe
call back another time.

112
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,910
She's right there, isn't she?

113
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,748
Yes, that's right.

114
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,723
Telemarketer.

115
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,024
Just give me a hint.
Tell me something. Anything.

116
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,927
I think if you want your customer
to change plans...

117
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:48,057
you should show her
some special consideration.

118
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,837
Special. Like a gift or something?

119
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,770
Not bad.
<i>What shouId I get her? </i>

120
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:59,471
Hey, she's very happy
with the plan she's got now. Thanks.

121
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,110
Only way to handle those guys.

122
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:22,123
Hey, Tru. Cool party.
It's good to see you again.

123
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,561
Thanks!

124
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,969
Who is that?

125
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,909
Oh, my God,
Marty's actually on time for once.

126
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,269
Marty. That's who that was.

127
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,974
Can you believe
this thing came with instructions?

128
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,242
- For a knife?
- Yeah.

129
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,683
- Apparently you can cut through rebar.
- Good to know.

130
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,353
Thank you. Thank you very much.

131
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,393
- Hey, Sam.
- Tru, I'm so sorry about the vase.

132
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,623
Don't be. You know what they say:

133
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,598
"Priceless heirlooms
are made to be broken."

134
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,704
So, how are you? How's med school?
You're at Hopkins, right?

135
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,965
No. That kind of fell through.

136
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:04,540
I missed the final
because of a big family emergency...

137
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,044
and this jerk professor
wouldn't give me a make- up.

138
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,341
Sorry to hear that.

139
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:12,407
So, now I'm selling shoes with my dad
in his store until I can reapply.

140
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,386
- What about you?
- Tagging toes at the morgue.

141
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,914
Man. And I thought I had it bad.

142
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,102
Harrison, it's beautiful.

143
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,406
That's just a little something
from me to you.

144
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:41,404
Actually, it's from Bill to Sally.

145
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:45,877
- What?
- Yeah, there's an inscription on the back.

146
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:51,251
- "To Sally from Bill."
- That. No, that can be removed.

147
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,122
Where did you get this thing?
A pawn shop?

148
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,854
Is that a problem?

149
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,331
- Happy house warming.
- Thank you.

150
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,205
Come here one second.

151
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,671
Whatever happened to,
what is that saying:

152
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,772
"It's the thought that counts"?

153
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:21,479
It counts if it's yours.
This thought here happens to be Bill's.

154
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,289
Hi. You must be Luc. I'm Lindsay.

155
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,885
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my brother, Harrison.

156
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,793
How's it going?
A pleasure.

157
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,924
Tru, can you help me
with the punch real quick?

158
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,298
Let me ask you a question, guy to guy.

159
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,769
Wanna buy a watch?

160
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,710
Okay, your brother
is so hopeless.

161
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,148
I mean, a pawned watch? How tacky.

162
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,880
Harrison just has his own way
of doing things.

163
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,751
Right. The cheap way.

164
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,689
- Lindsay.
- Okay, sorry. Change of subject.

165
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,085
Your new boyfriend is hot.

166
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,731
I just hope he's having a good time.

167
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,257
If he isn't, so what.
It's your party, remember?

168
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:13,633
I've already had a few.
I should probably slow down.

169
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:18,335
Nights like this do not happen that often,
especially with a job like yours.

170
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,180
Cheers.
Cheers.

171
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:29,120
Tru, there's an angry guy at the door.
He says he's your neighbor.

172
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,893
Turn the music down,
or else I'm calling the police.

173
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,487
All you had to do was ask, Brian.

174
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,796
No, I'm not asking, I'm telling.
Turn the music down.

175
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:43,960
Fine.
Yeah.

176
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,732
'Cause me and the landlord,
we're like that.

177
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,240
One call from me,
he's gonna take away your parking spot.

178
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,038
I don't have a car.

179
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,942
In case you get one.

180
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,451
Why didn't you invite
your next- door neighbor?

181
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,250
- Are you kidding me? That guy's a creep.
- All the more reason to invite him.

182
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,554
If he's helping make the noise,
he can't complain about it, right?

183
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,594
Well, it's too late now.

184
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,730
Bye. Bye, you guys.

185
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,566
I'll call you, okay?

186
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,640
I need to talk to you.

187
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:30,147
I know that I shouldn't be here,
it's inappropriate...

188
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,844
but I cannot stay away, and I am sorry.

189
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,579
You need to go. Now, Mark.

190
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,917
- I need you to talk to me.
- We're through talking.

191
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:40,425
All I'm asking for
is five minutes of your time.

192
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,391
Five minutes, Tru, and then I will go.

193
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,696
Fine. But not here.

194
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,402
Okay. Then meet me upstairs on the roof.

195
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,874
Promise me.

196
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,309
Just wait for me there.

197
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,414
Hey, what was that about?

198
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,619
That was the guy
who called me this morning.

199
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:15,921
Your ex?

200
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:19,292
He just kind of showed up.
He wants to talk to me.

201
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,557
So talk to him.

202
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,235
You're okay with that?

203
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,705
I trust you.

204
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,005
Thanks.

205
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,515
Mark?

206
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,425
What the hell's the matter with you?

207
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,797
The first time I ever kissed you
was on this roof.

208
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,338
- And I thought maybe if--
- Mark.

209
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,206
No. Stay.

210
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,975
Talk to me
about how great we are together.

211
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,916
You need to go home.
Don't come near me again.

212
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:20,718
Great.

213
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,030
Drive safe.

214
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,668
Call you a cab, Sam?

215
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:40,337
No, but if you know of a good place
to throw up, that would be great.

216
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:43,176
Down the steps, hook a right,
anywhere in the alley's fine.

217
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,511
You rock.

218
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,489
- You okay?
- Yeah. Where did everybody go?

219
00:14:56,962 --> 00:15:00,022
Without you here,
no one really felt like partying.

220
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,329
That, and we ran out of booze.

221
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,126
Is everything okay with the party- crasher?

222
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,329
Fine.

223
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,971
You tired?

224
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:13,209
Lindsay's punch kind of got my head
doing summersaults.

225
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,339
- Go to bed. I'll clean up after you.
- Just leave it till tomorrow.

226
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,747
All right. Let's get you to bed.

227
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:27,459
Thanks for everything.
I had such a good time tonight.

228
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:28,954
Me, too.

229
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,423
You want to stay?

230
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:36,326
I would love to.
But tonight, you need to sleep.

231
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,528
- So I'll see you tomorrow?
- Count on it.

232
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,405
Luc? I thought you said
you were going home.

233
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,983
<i>911 emergency. </i>
<i>May I have your name and Iocation? </i>

234
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,549
Tru Davies, 1723 Oracle.
I'm calling to report a murder.

235
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,185
<i>Can you teII me what happened? </i>

236
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,890
I just woke up and he was here.
I don't know how.

237
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,023
Tru?

238
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,394
<i>Miss, are you stiII there? </i>

239
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,375
<i>Stay on the Iine, pIease. </i>

240
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,348
Tru, I need you.

241
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,297
So you finally did it.

242
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,673
Thirty- nine straight days at the morgue
and you finally took one off.

243
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,770
<i>I had to see it for myseIf. </i>

244
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,111
I don't get this. You moved
into this place six months ago...

245
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,347
and you're throwing
a house warming party tonight?

246
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,380
Tru?

247
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,952
Sorry. What's that?

248
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:20,589
Hello?

249
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,793
<i>Tru? It's me. </i>

250
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:24,427
Mark.

251
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,698
<i>Yeah. You haven't forgotten. </i>
<i>I'm gIad. </i>

252
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,296
There's something
that I'd like to talk to you about...

253
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,433
but I don't want to
talk to you over the phone.

254
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,010
Standard Diner. One hour.

255
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:34,443
Yeah. Okay.

256
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,251
That was Davis.
He needs me to work today.

257
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,947
You're kidding.

258
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,124
Can it wait until after breakfast?

259
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:53,687
He said it was an emergency.
You're not mad, are you?

260
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,128
No, I just feel bad for you.

261
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,161
It seems like you never catch a break.

262
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,176
I'll see you tonight, right?
Yeah.

263
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,783
I turned him over, there was
a single wound below the heart.

264
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:17,618
I called 91 1, but then he asked for help,
and the day restarted, and here I am.

265
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:22,787
So, if I'm to understand you correctly,
you had a party and didn't invite me?

266
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,055
Davis.

267
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,359
- I thought we were friends.
- We are friends.

268
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,399
Sure, when you wake up
next to some dead guy.

269
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,095
I apologize. Can we please focus here?

270
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,428
Okay.

271
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,573
So you have no idea
how Mike ended up in your bed?

272
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,770
Mark. And, no, I don't.
Look, I had a lot to drink last night.

273
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,473
- What about suspects?
- So far, I can only think of one.

274
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:43,537
- Who?
- Me.

275
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:44,639
Come on, Tru.

276
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,843
I don't know.
Mark was acting so weird yesterday.

277
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,046
Maybe he got violent,
maybe I fought back.

278
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,487
- There's no way did you kill him.
- How do you know?

279
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:55,084
Because I know you.
You save lives, you don't take them.

280
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,789
The victim was stabbed once
in the chest.

281
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,354
<i>Was that the onIy wound? </i>

282
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,771
There was a pretty deep cut
in the palm of his right hand.

283
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:07,805
What else?

284
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,269
There was blood
on the wall behind my bed.

285
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,368
It looked like sort of a half circle.

286
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,310
lnteresting. Any place else?

287
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,978
I just woke up and he was here.
I don't know how.

288
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,479
Yeah, on the doorknob.

289
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,545
And you said
you found the knife on the floor.

290
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:25,612
Beside the bed.

291
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,157
Only the first couple inches
of the blade were bloody.

292
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,531
That indicates a shallow wound.

293
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,900
You don't think it was suicide?

294
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,666
No. The slash on his palm
sounds like a defense wound...

295
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:45,709
meaning he was trying to protect himself,
which suggests murder.

296
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,743
Here, let me show you something.

297
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,852
It's a forensic simulator program.

298
00:20:55,921 --> 00:21:00,153
Helps investigators recreate a crime scene
that has been tampered with or destroyed.

299
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,716
So you're gonna recreate
my apartment on the computer?

300
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,125
I put in these variables.

301
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:07,825
I might be able to extrapolate
some ballpark description of the killer.

302
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,629
- How ballpark?
- Height, weight, sex.

303
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,602
It'll take a few hours.

304
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,002
I'm meeting Mark in 15 minutes.

305
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,006
Aren't you forgetting something?

306
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,746
- The party. I'm invited tonight, right?
- There isn't gonna be a party.

307
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,611
No, there has to be a party.

308
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,550
There has to be a party.
In order to save Mark's life...

309
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:31,715
you have to recreate the circumstances
that led to his death exactly.

310
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,815
Not only can you not
cancel the party...

311
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:37,089
you have to make absolutely sure
that he shows up.

312
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,329
Otherwise, the killer
could strike some other place.

313
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,766
Some place where you will not be able
to protect him.

314
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,160
All right.

315
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,034
Sorry, Harrison. We'll do lunch tomorrow.

316
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,340
Actually, there was something
I needed to talk to you about.

317
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,844
- Lindsay, right?
- Yeah. How did you--

318
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:56,881
If you want her to like you,
you got to make her feel special.

319
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,575
How do I do that?

320
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,852
I don't know. Pick some flowers,
or burn her a CD mix.

321
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,716
Could I just go buy her something?

322
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:07,020
Fine. Just make sure it's not a watch
with another woman's name on it.

323
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,859
Come on. I would never do that.

324
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,963
Unless I did that. Did I do that?

325
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,601
I thought you don't believe
that I relive days.

326
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,803
I don't. I mean, look, I'd like to. I would.

327
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,897
But don't change the subject.

328
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:24,875
<i>AII I wanted was advice. </i>

329
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:28,673
Okay, then just remember.
Think personal, not personalized.

330
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,578
Personal, not personalized.

331
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:31,980
It's been a while.
You okay? You seem a little....

332
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,211
It's been a while.
You okay? You seem a little....

333
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,848
Yeah, it's nothing. I'm fine.

334
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,952
- It's kind of strange seeing me, isn't it?
- Kind of.

335
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:46,458
- Anyway, the reason I called--
- Yeah, what's been going on with you?

336
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:51,464
Me? You know, the usual. Just classes,
grading papers, praying for tenure.

337
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,368
And what else? Personally?

338
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,773
I was seeing somebody.

339
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:01,936
But I broke it off, if that's what you mean.

340
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,311
- Another student?
- Yeah.

341
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:09,113
- It's not one of my best qualities, is it?
- Anyone I know?

342
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:14,324
Got to admit, Tru, this isn't
the conversation I thought we'd be having.

343
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,257
Her name is Julie Spence.

344
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:20,697
She graduated last spring,
and now she works in the Mayor's office.

345
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,427
How'd she take it?

346
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,166
- Take what?
- The breakup.

347
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,605
Actually, she kind of went psycho on me...

348
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:32,700
and she even slashed my tires
the night I broke things off with her.

349
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:35,439
But you don't want to hear about this.

350
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,181
It's really good to see you again, Tru.

351
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,217
Yeah. You, too.

352
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:48,960
This is great.
It was strange, but it was great.

353
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,023
Yeah, it was good to see you.

354
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:55,900
You know, we talked so much
during lunch, I never got to...

355
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,832
tell you why I called.

356
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:01,931
I've been thinking about you
a lot, Tru. About us.

357
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,231
About how great we were together.

358
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:07,607
And I miss you so much.
And I want you back.

359
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,507
Look, I know we have a lot to work out,
but I will do whatever it takes.

360
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,313
I'm seeing someone.

361
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:18,847
And I know how this is gonna sound,
but I want us to stay friends.

362
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,287
Friends. Yes, I've heard that one before.

363
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:26,888
No, really. I'm having a party tonight.
You should come.

364
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,966
We could talk some more,
you know, about everything.

365
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:34,997
Okay. That sounds great.

366
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:37,506
I have a late class,
but I'll swing by right after.

367
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:38,873
Okay.
Okay.

368
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,206
Bye.

369
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,049
I guess Davis didn't need you after all.

370
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:53,055
- What are you doing here?
- I'm on my way to work.

371
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:55,524
Which, by the way,
is where you're supposed to be.

372
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:58,461
Look, the guy you just saw me with
is my ex- boyfriend.

373
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,088
He's the one that called this morning.

374
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,895
That's why you ran out on breakfast?
So you could meet him?

375
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,163
Luc, he's in trouble.
He needed to talk to me.

376
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,999
What kind of trouble?

377
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,606
It's hard to explain.
You just have to trust me.

378
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:13,041
Like I trusted you when you said
you had to work this morning?

379
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,578
You know what?

380
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,204
Have fun at your party tonight, all right?

381
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,806
Luc, wait.

382
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,287
You called me here
to look at a watermelon?

383
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,560
How's that supposed to
help us solve a murder?

384
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:36,862
Observe.

385
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:42,132
Notice there's no leakage.
The knife has sealed the wound.

386
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,574
But when you pull the knife out....

387
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,182
Does that look familiar?

388
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,277
You're saying
Mark pulled the knife out himself?

389
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:57,719
That's not all.
The blood on the doorknob suggests...

390
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,620
he opened the door
with his wounded hand...

391
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,751
indicating that he was stabbed
outside of your apartment.

392
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:06,058
Okay, here's the sequence of events
as I see them.

393
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,298
Mark Evans is attacked.

394
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,399
Left there for dead.

395
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,995
He gets to his feet,
he staggers towards your apartment.

396
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,138
With his wounded hand,
he opens the door.

397
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,839
Makes his way
to the foot of the bed...

398
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,253
<i>pIaces his hand on the knife-- </i>

399
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,811
And yanks it out of his own chest.

400
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,183
Precisely.

401
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,229
But how's he supposed to walk around
with a knife in his heart?

402
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:39,820
Because the knife sealed the wound.

403
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:43,061
For the first few minutes
there was probably very little blood loss.

404
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:46,069
- Then why pull it out?
- More than likely, he was in shock.

405
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:49,231
I know what you're thinking.
None of this proves you're the killer.

406
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:52,936
Yeah, none of this proves
that I'm not the killer, either.

407
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,309
You know what I was
supposed to be doing right now?

408
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:59,748
Making bean dip,
decorating for my party, having fun.

409
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,810
Nobody said this job was gonna be easy.

410
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,082
Yeah, no one said
it was gonna suck, either.

411
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,783
Tru, Tru.

412
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:09,219
You're not alone.

413
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,429
We are gonna crack this together.

414
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:30,744
Turn the music down,
or else I'm calling the police.

415
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:40,721
Hey, Brian. I'm having a party tonight
and I'd like you to come.

416
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:41,850
Seriously?

417
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:44,724
Yeah. What fun would it be
without my neighbors?

418
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,354
All right.
See you tonight?

419
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,899
Sure. Yeah.
I mean, I'm always up for a party.

420
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,127
Great.

421
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,156
"Julie Spence."

422
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,708
Tru, a little help here.

423
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:34,773
- Ever heard of two trips?
- If someone hadn't bailed on me.

424
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,542
Sorry about that. How much do I owe you?

425
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,776
$140 plus change.

426
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,754
Don't look at me like that. It was on sale.

427
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,498
You made me come all the way over here
to get rid of a knife?

428
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:59,833
- A perfectly good knife, I might add.
- Just lose it. I don't care how.

429
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:03,706
Hey, I still haven't figured out
a gift for Lindsay.

430
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:07,802
I mean, any other chick,
I'd buy candles or something.

431
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,676
But with Lindsay,
she's got such weird taste.

432
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,774
So get her something weird.
Just make sure--

433
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,046
I know. Get rid of the knife.

434
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,946
Something weird.

435
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,067
Excuse me? Julie?

436
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,239
You don't know me,
but my name's Tru Davies.

437
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,043
I'm a friend of Mark Evans.

438
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,448
Actually, I know exactly who you are.

439
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:54,154
- Mark used to talk about you all the time.
- He did?

440
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:58,018
He was obsessed with you,
even when he and I were together.

441
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,620
You here to gloat?

442
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,927
- About what?
- Getting him back.

443
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,130
I always knew he wasn't over you.

444
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,762
I didn't get him back.
I don't even want him back.

445
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:09,772
- Then what do you want?
- To warn you.

446
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,336
No matter how strong
your feelings are for Mark...

447
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,241
you can't let them get the best of you.

448
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,143
I have no idea what you're talking about.

449
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:19,012
He said you slashed his tires
the night he called things off.

450
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,710
No, it wasn't me.

451
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:24,718
But whoever did that terrible thing,
I'm sure Mark deserved it.

452
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,950
- Stay away from him.
- What are you, his bodyguard?

453
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:29,050
No. I'm just worried about him, that's all.

454
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:31,652
Whatever happened between us
is our business, not yours.

455
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:31,956
Whatever happened between us
is our business, not yours.

456
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,622
I'm not so sure about that.

457
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:38,101
- I'll deal with my exes my way, Tru.
- Yeah, that's what I'm worried about.

458
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,871
I think I finally get why you and Mark
were so perfect together.

459
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:44,839
You're both psychotic.

460
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,354
Come in.

461
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,832
I thought I might find you in here.

462
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:13,234
Yeah. A photographer in a darkroom.
Go figure.

463
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,729
I'm sorry I lied.

464
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,400
I only met Mark
because I was worried about him.

465
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,374
It won't happen again.

466
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:22,973
The first time we went out...

467
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:27,108
you warned me there'd be times
you'd take off with no explanation.

468
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,415
<i>And before today, I was okay with that. </i>

469
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:33,724
But now I'm curious.
When you leave, where do you go?

470
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,528
Come on. I mean, you said
you were gonna be honest with me.

471
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:40,894
- And I will.
- So tell me. What's the deal?

472
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,022
Do you have some secret life?

473
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:45,899
Another guy stashed somewhere?
Of course not.

474
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,269
Then why won't you tell me
what's going on with you?

475
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:53,669
Great.

476
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:58,347
Honesty.
Hey, Luc--

477
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,577
No, it's okay'cause we're just starting...

478
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,983
and it's better this happened now
instead of later.

479
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:06,286
Listen, if you're looking for
neat and easy...

480
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:09,884
then, yeah, you're probably right.
You've got the wrong girl.

481
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:13,624
But if you think you can handle something
a little more complicated...

482
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,667
then stick around. You won't be sorry.

483
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:24,599
Yeah.

484
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:29,279
Hello?
<i>I need to see you. Now. </i>

485
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:38,321
I've got to go. Davis needs me.

486
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,390
Yeah. I've heard that before.

487
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:50,361
I finished running the numbers
through the simulator.

488
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,596
Based on the victim's
own height and weight...

489
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,161
and the location
and moderate depth of the wounds...

490
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:58,731
I believe that the killer
was approximately 5'4", right handed...

491
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,834
and lacking upper body strength.

492
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:03,743
Mostly likely a female. What do you think?

493
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:06,812
I think you just described me.

494
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,590
Don't put words in my mouth.
I still don't think you did it.

495
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:22,565
5'4", right- handed,
my apartment, my knife. Who else could....

496
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,965
I'll deal with exes my way, Tru.

497
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,202
- Julie.
- Who?

498
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,000
Mark's ex- girlfriend.
She and I are about the same size.

499
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:33,339
There. All we have to do is go to the party,
keep an eye on Mark...

500
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:36,209
and if the ex shows up,
you and I will be there to stop her.

501
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,907
And if I'm the killer?

502
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,076
I will not let you
make the same mistake twice.

503
00:33:57,301 --> 00:34:00,759
Hey, Tru. Cool party.
It's good to see you again.

504
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:04,233
Thanks, Marty. Glad you could make it.

505
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,875
- Hey, neighbor. Kicking party.
- Thanks, neighbor.

506
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,817
You okay? You look a little worried.

507
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,786
The last party I had was kind of a disaster.

508
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:18,812
Before I moved in, I guess.

509
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,950
That's okay. Don't worry.
If things start to slow down...

510
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:25,484
I'll go get my karaoke machine.
People love that stuff.

511
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:34,498
So here's a little something
from me to you.

512
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:41,142
I know you got, like, a ton.
But this one's supposed to be pretty rare.

513
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:42,844
Oh, my God!

514
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:47,750
Popeye, 1952, blue base, no feet.
There was only 2, 000 of these made.

515
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,011
How did you know?

516
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,556
You said something about
a collection once.

517
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:55,922
Guess I wanted you to know
that I was listening.

518
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,694
Look what your brother gave me.

519
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:05,064
- Sorry. He means well.
- Are you kidding? I love it.

520
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:07,398
You do?
Yeah.

521
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:10,941
I don't know, I'm thinking
maybe I was wrong about him.

522
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,005
Maybe he is special.

523
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,908
You haven't seen Mark, have you?

524
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,505
As in your ex? Why would he be here?

525
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,077
- I invited him.
- What?

526
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:23,777
Why would you do that? What about Luc?

527
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:25,516
It's a long story.

528
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,956
You know what you need?
Some of my special punch.

529
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,031
Thanks, but not tonight.

530
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:38,692
Hi.

531
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:39,827
How's it going?

532
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:43,169
No sign of Mark or Julie yet,
but it's still early.

533
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,531
I'm glad you're here.

534
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,476
Thanks for having me.
Where should I stand?

535
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,822
Where is that knife I bought?

536
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:06,920
Need something?

537
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:10,763
'Cause if you do, you know,
I live just right next door.

538
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,234
Got a knife?

539
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:19,107
Now I'm selling shoes with my dad
in his store until I can reapply.

540
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,644
How about you?

541
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:25,580
Would you just excuse me one sec?
Yeah. No problem.

542
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,150
- Where did you get that?
- Your neighbor.

543
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,155
I can't find the one
I bought today. Have you seen it?

544
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:35,056
No, just be careful, okay?

545
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:38,554
- Okay.
- Sis, you got a sec?

546
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,399
I don't think it's gonna happen
for me and Linds.

547
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:52,237
- But she loved your present.
- Yeah, but...

548
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:56,871
she's so into me now, it's sort of a turnoff.

549
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:01,243
You mind if I turn on the TV,
check out some scores?

550
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,217
Yeah, whatever.
Okay.

551
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:11,658
You made it.

552
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,357
Yeah. Sorry I'm late.
My class ran kind of long.

553
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:15,956
Not a problem. I'm glad you're here.

554
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:17,091
Yeah. Me, too.

555
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,659
- Do you have a second?
- Sure.

556
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:23,571
It's kind of loud in here.
Do you think we can go to the roof?

557
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:28,642
- I'm the hostess, I shouldn't.
- Come on, it'll take a second.

558
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:42,358
I thought you had a boyfriend.
What happened? He go missing or....

559
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,087
No, he's not here.

560
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:48,296
- Trouble in paradise?
- Something like that.

561
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:53,699
Trust me. He's a fool
to walk away from a girl like you.

562
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,903
Take it from someone who knows.

563
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,768
Thanks.

564
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:07,209
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry, you invited me to the party--

565
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,277
Mark, I told you. I just want to be friends.

566
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,346
But friends isn't enough.
I won't give you up, Tru.

567
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,221
You're gonna have to.

568
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,665
Maybe he got violent,
maybe I fought back.

569
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:29,701
Look, just stay away from me, Mark.

570
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,770
For your own good.

571
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:36,443
Tru.

572
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,684
Downstairs, hook a right,
anywhere in the alley.

573
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,020
You rock.

574
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,159
Bye.

575
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,434
- So your brother took off on me.
- You're kidding.

576
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,563
He said something about
a card game downtown...

577
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,575
and then he just split.
Can you believe that?

578
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,737
- What's that for?
- Your vase. Sam knocked it over.

579
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:13,143
I shouldn't have let him
drink so much tonight.

580
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:16,152
It wasn't a drunk thing.
It was more like an angry thing.

581
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,414
What do you mean?

582
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,422
He got all worked up
over some professor...

583
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,458
that cost him a slot in med school.

584
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,959
...and this jerk professor
wouldn't give me a make- up.

585
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,360
The killer was approximately 5'4",
right handed--

586
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,728
Then meet me upstairs on the roof.

587
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,160
Sam.

588
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,065
Johns Hopkins!

589
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:42,942
The most prestigious medical school
in this entire country!

590
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,037
And they wanted me.

591
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,514
I'll make a telephone call
and explain what happened.

592
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,609
It's too late for that now!

593
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:50,278
It took me months...

594
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:53,346
but I was finally
getting my life back together...

595
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:56,791
and then you just go
and show up at my friend's party?

596
00:39:56,861 --> 00:40:00,854
I just knew I couldn't let it go this time.
I couldn't let it go.

597
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,156
Put it down, Sam.

598
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,100
Tru, this is the guy.
This is the guy I was telling you about.

599
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:07,899
You're drunk. You don't want to do this.

600
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,107
No, I had a plan.

601
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:13,507
I had one chance, Tru.

602
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,804
And he took it from me.

603
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:20,608
So take it back.

604
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,379
What are you talking about?

605
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,979
If you don't like how
things went down the first time...

606
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,024
- do something about it.
- I am!

607
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,061
No, you're giving up.
If you hurt Mark...

608
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,359
your life actually becomes
the sob story you think it is.

609
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,492
You could spend 20 years in a cell
feeling sorry for yourself.

610
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,763
Is that what you really want?

611
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:45,833
God!

612
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,389
Tru, I don't know how to thank you.

613
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,191
You could say goodbye.

614
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,741
Ex- student with a carving knife
on the roof.

615
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,805
The simulator would've
never figured that one out.

616
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:28,613
I still don't get how Mark made it
all the way back here...

617
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,711
with a knife in his chest.

618
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:35,222
Well, he loved you, Tru.
That always makes a person stronger.

619
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:44,297
I hope I'm not too late.

620
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:47,360
You know what?
I'll just see you guys at work.

621
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,769
Thanks, D.

622
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:55,536
So I've been thinking.

623
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,415
About?
That nothing good comes easy.

624
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:05,079
If I need to work a little harder
to keep you in my life, then so be it.

625
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:07,555
<i>I have a feeIing you're worth it. </i>

626
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,856
What about when I take off?

627
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,497
Think you can handle it?

628
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,532
I guess we'll find out.

629
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:22,429
Sorry I missed your party.

630
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:25,868
It's not over yet.

631
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,473
- No?
- No.

632
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,946
Not tonight.
