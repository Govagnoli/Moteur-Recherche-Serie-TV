1
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:10,837
Help me.

2
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:48,709
There you are, Tru.

3
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:51,516
<i>Can you do me a favor? </i>

4
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,517
Yeah, sure.

5
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:56,953
Hand me the other bulb.

6
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,794
Can l ask you a question, Davis?
Absolutely.

7
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,157
Do you like it here?

8
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,028
Been here eight years.
Not sure what else l'd do.

9
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,091
But do you like it here?

10
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,268
ls everything okay?

11
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,736
Doesn't it ever get to you...

12
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:18,642
seeing all these dead people
day after day?

13
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:19,837
Yeah.

14
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:24,606
Sure, l guess some days
l wish l was in Ear, Nose and Throat...

15
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:27,383
but most of the time, it's okay.

16
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:30,588
My friend Lindsay works
in public relations.

17
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:32,319
So do we.

18
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:36,018
Our public just happens to be dead.

19
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,291
Here's what l think, Tru.

20
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,099
We're all someplace for a reason.

21
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:47,605
Just sometimes we need to accept
what that reason is.

22
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,157
Damn.

23
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,163
Hello?
<i>Hey, sis. </i>

24
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,493
Sorry. Were you sleeping?

25
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,268
<i>It's fine. </i>

26
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,705
l have to wake up in 12 hours anyways.

27
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:39,442
l wanted to make sure we were
still on for brunch today at your place.

28
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,379
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Great. See you then.

29
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:43,671
But--

30
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,378
l got to go. Battery's dying.

31
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,976
<i>See you, Tru. </i>

32
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,499
- So, you think she'll like me?
- Listen, l told you, Tru is the best.

33
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:07,135
But she has been tough
on some of the girls l bring around.

34
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,404
There's been others?

35
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,777
But none that matters.

36
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,742
Sounds like a line.

37
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,544
The same one you used
to get me in bed in the first place.

38
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,377
Serious.

39
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,081
When l think of all the other girls
l wasted time with...

40
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,057
thinking, you know, she's the one, but....

41
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,784
Then l meet you.

42
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,826
You'll jinx it.
Superstitious?

43
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,622
Just about certain things.

44
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,324
Parking, love.

45
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:38,732
ls that what we're talking about here?
Love?

46
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,039
l'm gonna hit the showers...

47
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,843
make sure l look presentable
for your overprotective sister.

48
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,327
Come here. What is that?

49
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,398
What?
On your back. Let me see that.

50
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,331
lt's nothing, really.

51
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,268
l slipped when l was working out.

52
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,329
- You slipped?
- Yeah.

53
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,673
This had nothing to do with--

54
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,802
No, this had nothing
to do with anything.

55
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,175
Just a...

56
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,243
clumsy girl on a StairMaster.

57
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,524
He tried to pick me up.

58
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,822
- l did not try to pick you up.
- Then what would you call it?

59
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,831
lt was a diner.
You were alone, l was alone.

60
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:44,130
- l was just trying to make conversation.
- You tried to pick her up.

61
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,060
Anyway, l wouldn't talk to him.

62
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,335
Not some stranger who was
way too cute to be good for me.

63
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,172
But he was persistent.

64
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,613
He got my number, called, called again.
Finally, l agreed to meet him for lunch.

65
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,672
That was three weeks ago.

66
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,918
And the rest is history.

67
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,351
<i>My brother's in Iove. </i>

68
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,984
- Already? l thought he just met her.
- He did.

69
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,822
The boy moves fast.

70
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:12,655
God, l hate people in love.
They always act so superior.

71
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,428
So they found someone
that will actually put up with them.

72
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,265
Speaking of,
what's happening with James?

73
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,807
Third date tonight,
and you know what that means.

74
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,569
The third- date rule.

75
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,111
One of the great overlooked inventions
of our time.

76
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,646
Thank you.
You're welcome.

77
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,613
So, you gonna sleep with him?

78
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,412
lt's the third date, Tru. Fish or cut bait.

79
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,544
You believe in the third- date rule,
don't you?

80
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,487
l believe in you. So if you believe in it....

81
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,957
He's so sweet. A little shy.

82
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,022
My God, you like him.

83
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,591
l liked her.
Sarah. Really?

84
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,261
Yeah, l thought she was great.
But?

85
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,333
There's no buts. She's a keeper, Harrison.

86
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,464
Yeah. That's great, Tru.

87
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:59,011
l mean, we both know how you can be
a little tough on some of my girls.

88
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,205
Let's be honest. You've had some winners.

89
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,407
l'm not even talking about
the stripper years.

90
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,385
No, but Sarah, she's different, Tru.
l don't know.

91
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,545
l mean, when l'm with her, it's....

92
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,522
l'm better, you know?

93
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,088
Nice.

94
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:22,126
l'll tell you, her ex- husband's a real fool
to let her get away.

95
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,702
Wow, she's divorced?

96
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:27,136
Yeah. The guy sounds like
a real piece of work, too.

97
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,575
But she believes in me.

98
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:34,242
Damn, l don't even
believe in myself half the time.

99
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,373
But here's this girl, this....
No, this woman...

100
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,850
who thinks l'm someone special.

101
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,688
l love this girl!

102
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,158
This is a weird night.

103
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,157
We got to find somebody for you...

104
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,063
because this whole third- wheel stuff?
New.

105
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:00,138
Hello? Hey, sweetie, how are you?

106
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,171
- What, now?
- ls everything all right?

107
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:10,341
No, don't worry, Sarah. l'll be right there.
l'm sorry, got to go.

108
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,318
- ls she okay?
- Don't worry. Nothing l can't handle.

109
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,219
But l'll call you later, okay? l promise.

110
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,188
lt was awful. lt was awkward and fast.

111
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,389
And afterwards,
he wouldn't even look at me.

112
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:26,761
He just made up some excuse...

113
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,062
that he had to get up early
the next morning...

114
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,601
and ran out of my apartment.

115
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,138
What did you do?
<i>What couId I do? </i>

116
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,935
l said goodbye
and ate a tube of cookie dough.

117
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:40,104
So, not only did l just have the worst
sex of my life with a guy l really liked...

118
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,376
but l also gained two pounds.
Okay, you know what?

119
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,017
l'm officially over the third- date rule.

120
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,054
lt's just another male invention
to get us into the sack.

121
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,748
Honey, l'm home.

122
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,683
- l got to call you back.
- Yeah, okay.

123
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,588
91 1 took the call at 10:30.

124
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,460
The body was found
in his ex- wife's house.

125
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,330
Bullet in the chest.

126
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:08,369
lt's nice to know some people
got a worse relationship than l do.

127
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,043
Bag that for me?
Yeah.

128
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,641
Andrew Webb, lives at the harbor.

129
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:19,874
Nice. Should've spent some of that money
on a bullet- proof vest.

130
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,831
Oh, my God.

131
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,761
Sarah.

132
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:42,207
<i>I'II try pIaying President Truman. </i>
ALE<i>X</i> <i>1979. </i>

133
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,141
<i>Hey, </i>
<i>this is Harrison. Leave me a message. </i>

134
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,736
Hi, it's me again.
l really need to talk to you...

135
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:51,340
so just call me back
as soon as you get this, all right?

136
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,182
- Are you okay?
- l'm fine.

137
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,283
l mean, these people are such brainiacs.

138
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,789
<i>...tropicaI fIowers. </i>

139
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,524
<i>What are orchids? </i>
<i>Correct. </i>

140
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,994
l mean, the only questions l know
are about <i>GiIIigan's IsIand. </i>

141
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:08,227
<i>1972. Ken Howard</i>
<i>as this decIaration writer....</i>

142
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,700
Hello?
<i>Tru, it's Meredith. </i>

143
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,038
Listen, l really need to reach Harrison.

144
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,936
<i>You haven't heard from him</i>
<i>by any chance? </i>

145
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,372
Actually, l have.

146
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,410
He's under arrest, Tru.
<i>For what? </i>

147
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,105
They haven't filed yet,
but my guess is murder one.

148
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,238
What?

149
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:25,511
<i>They're saying that he kiIIed</i>
<i>his girIfriend's ex. </i>

150
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,011
Andrew Webb?

151
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:30,852
- Yeah, that's the guy. How do you know?
- His body just came in.

152
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,551
But there's no way.
Harrison could never kill someone.

153
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,151
lt doesn't look good.
His blood is in her living room.

154
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,594
- His prints were on the gun.
- Where is he now?

155
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,894
They're taking him downtown.
Listen, l got to run.

156
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,526
- l'll call you when l know more.
- Mere, wait.

157
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,165
Gardez, l'm gonna need you
to cover for me.

158
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,572
Just tell Davis l'll be back as soon as l can.

159
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:51,940
Are you okay?

160
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,945
<i>This fIower's name</i>

161
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,674
l don't know yet.

162
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,452
Not that l'm not cool
with the whole concept...

163
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,657
of corpses speaking to me...

164
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,664
but if you were going to ask for my help...

165
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,704
now would be the time.

166
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,443
Help me.

167
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,495
Hello?
<i>Hey, sis. </i>

168
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,156
Were you sleeping?

169
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:23,497
Harrison, l need you to listen to me,
and listen carefully.

170
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,678
l'm going to tell you something.
<i>Can this wait tiII brunch? </i>

171
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,079
Wait, you're still having us
for brunch, right?

172
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,312
Yes, but something's gonna happen today.
Something important.

173
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,116
l know. You're meeting Sarah.

174
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,590
Don't be such a drama queen.
l got to go. Battery's dying.

175
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,524
Harrison, no. Wait.

176
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,316
Help me.

177
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,717
You're here early.

178
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,783
By about...12 hours.

179
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,688
l'm not staying.

180
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,888
For someone who doesn't like it here,
you sure are around a lot.

181
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,061
You ever think that maybe
you just belong here?

182
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,534
l'll let you know in about 12 hours.

183
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,807
lssues.

184
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,847
lt's Harrison. He's in trouble.
<i>Harrison's aIways in troubIe. </i>

185
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,013
You pulled me out of a meeting
to tell me that?

186
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:54,048
- Today's different.
- Okay, l'll bite. How's today different?

187
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:55,892
This is gonna sound strange...

188
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,191
but do you think Harrison
could ever kill someone?

189
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,256
- What? What kind of question is that?
- Do you?

190
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,994
<i>He's our brother. </i>

191
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,798
l mean, we haven't been that close
over the years, but....

192
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,099
l just need you to be honest.

193
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:10,175
Do you think Harrison
could ever kill someone?

194
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,339
Yes.

195
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:19,007
l don't think he would ever--
<i>What is this about? </i>

196
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,212
<i>Or is this just one of</i>
<i>your crazy hypotheticaIs? </i>

197
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,289
Yeah. That's what it is.

198
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,382
But look, l'm gonna need your help today,
no questions asked.

199
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,519
Okay, fine. But next time,
not during meetings, okay?

200
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,587
Right. l'll be in touch.

201
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,295
You'll be in touch.

202
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,469
You're late.

203
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,004
lt's a good thing l didn't return
that spare key...

204
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,405
or l'd have to shimmy up
that drain pipe again.

205
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,740
- l'm glad to see you.
- Yeah, you, too.

206
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,308
Feel free to let go any time.

207
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,979
l want you to meet....

208
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,286
Sarah.
You must be Tru.

209
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,452
- l've heard so much about you.
- Mutual.

210
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:06,021
You have a lovely place.
These old buildings are just great.

211
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:09,397
- Can l talk to you for one sec?
- Come on. We just got here.

212
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:13,029
Besides, there's nothing you can't say
in front of Sarah.

213
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,132
Okay.

214
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,535
l ran into Andrew yesterday.

215
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:20,606
Andrew?

216
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,471
My ex- husband.

217
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,019
Tru? Word?

218
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:37,989
ln the future, two topics that are off-limits
when meeting my new girlfriends:

219
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,190
my exes and their exes.

220
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,495
l need you to stay away from Sarah today.

221
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,661
Man, you never change.

222
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:48,072
Every girl l bring around,
you find something wrong with.

223
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,007
So, she's divorced. What is the big deal?

224
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,067
Half the country is divorced.

225
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,170
lt's nothing against her.
lt's you that l'm worried about.

226
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,613
l'm a big boy.

227
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,516
lf l get my heart stomped,
l get my heart stomped.

228
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,747
You can't protect me forever.

229
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,415
No, but l can protect you for today.

230
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,425
Look, go to the movies,
go play the horses, whatever.

231
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:12,487
- But just stay away from her, please.
- l don't get you sometimes.

232
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,528
Which lately, has been most of the time.

233
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,568
Just do this for me, okay? Just for today.

234
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,732
Why do you always have to do things
the hard way?

235
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,332
Because l can.

236
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,658
Can l help you?

237
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,062
l didn't realize anyone was here. l'm sorry.

238
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,006
You're taking pictures of my home.

239
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,237
You'll have to do better than that.

240
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,845
We're putting together
a book on the harbor.

241
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,211
You know, sights and sounds, all that.

242
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,577
A book?

243
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,210
A book proposal, actually.

244
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,319
l won't bore you with the details...

245
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:13,381
but we wouldn't use any of the pictures
without your permission.

246
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:17,520
Your boat is just so beautiful.
l'm sorry about the inconvenience.

247
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,888
lt's got an inside, too.

248
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,902
So, tell me about the book.

249
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,702
Beer, wine? Can l get you something?

250
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:35,003
Why do l think
you're not interested in the book?

251
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,048
Why do l think you're one of the more
perceptive women l've met lately?

252
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,449
She's very pretty.

253
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,113
That's Sarah.

254
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:49,258
l'm sure we have better things
to talk about than my wife.

255
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:52,593
<i>- You sure you don't want a drink? </i>
- Sorry. l'm on the clock.

256
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:56,623
But, it's nice to see divorce
doesn't slow you down at all.

257
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,966
Sarah and l aren't divorced.
We're separated.

258
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:02,438
- Sarah isn't your ex- wife?
- No, she's my current wife.

259
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,204
Hello?

260
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,808
Where are you?
l've been waiting for half an hour.

261
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,751
l'm sorry. Something's come up.

262
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,812
<i>I'II try</i>
<i>not to take that personaIIy. </i>

263
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,858
Look, l'll just call you tonight, then.

264
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,654
Just remember one thing.

265
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,958
The third- date rule was invented by men
to try and get us into bed.

266
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,123
Whatever you do, don't fall for it.

267
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,863
You take this overprotective- sister
role pretty seriously l see.

268
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,572
Why didn't you tell Harrison
you're still married?

269
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,303
He said you were tough.

270
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,213
But l didn't think your blessing
would require an interview...

271
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,409
and a background check.

272
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:49,386
l'm sorry. He's my little brother.
Sometimes l get carried away.

273
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:53,481
Look, just because we don't have
signed divorce papers...

274
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,093
doesn't make it any more of a marriage.

275
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,619
Do you know anyone
who would want to hurt your husband?

276
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,923
People don't hurt Andrew.

277
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,662
Andrew hurts them.

278
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,133
l married him when l was young.

279
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,707
Too young.

280
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,345
Maybe that's why l thought
it was my fault.

281
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,412
That somehow
l had done something wrong.

282
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,042
l deserved it.

283
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,812
Deserved what?

284
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:30,453
Call it what you want.
Domestic violence, physical abuse.

285
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,856
lt all hurts just the same.

286
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:39,866
l finally got the courage to leave.
l thought the hard part was over.

287
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:44,503
lt took me a year to realize
the hard part hadn't yet begun.

288
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,874
He won't divorce you?

289
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,875
No. Giving up control
doesn't really appeal to Andrew.

290
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,715
Which is why these make sense.

291
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,653
l found them in the mailbox this morning.

292
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:06,459
No name, but it doesn't take
a genius to know who sent them.

293
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:11,068
Look, should l have told Harrison sooner
that l was still married?

294
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,266
Probably.

295
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,465
l just didn't want to scare him off.

296
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,076
He doesn't scare easy, you know?

297
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,807
l know. That's what l love about him.

298
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,483
Like it or not, l do love him.

299
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,318
So do l.

300
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,957
You tell me to stay away from Sarah,
and you go and hassle her.

301
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,900
You know she called me, near tears.
She thinks you hate her.

302
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,836
l don't hate her, Harrison.
That's not what this is about.

303
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,565
Then what is it about?

304
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:52,474
You have to trust me, okay?
Trust that l know what l'm doing.

305
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,772
Or maybe l don't. l don't know.

306
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,609
You were making a lot more sense...

307
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,877
when you thought
dead people were talking to you.

308
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,008
Thanks.

309
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,145
And when did you become
such a hypocrite?

310
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,246
You sleep with your college professor...

311
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,451
and you're all over me because
l'm dating a woman who's separated.

312
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:08,959
No, it's not about that.

313
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:13,157
The reason she's not divorced, Tru,
is'cause she's scared to file.

314
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,733
Damn it, Tru.

315
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,330
You know what l think?
l think it's'cause l'm happy.

316
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,140
Yeah. 'Cause l met someone,
and it kills you...

317
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:29,806
that your pathetic little brother's
having a better life than you.

318
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:34,681
All this time you had me convinced
that Meredith was the selfish one.

319
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,447
But it's been you all along.

320
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,752
Harrison, you're getting it all wrong.
Am l?

321
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:44,586
lt seems to me for the first time,
l'm getting it right.

322
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:34,573
Let me guess. There's no book.

323
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:38,381
l'd like to ask you
a few questions, Mr. Webb.

324
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,113
You better talk fast,
because the police will be here shortly.

325
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,314
You know, l should've known.

326
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,117
- How much is Sarah paying you?
- For what?

327
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:50,855
To dig up dirt, to force my hand
in granting her a divorce.

328
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:54,057
Oh, God, you know we've been
playing this game for months.

329
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:58,125
And frankly, her lack of originality
is beginning to surprise me.

330
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,602
This is Andrew Webb at the harbor.

331
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,763
l don't work for your wife.
l'm here to help you.

332
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,670
l have an intruder onboard.

333
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,436
Help me with what?

334
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,175
Live to see tomorrow.

335
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,310
ls that a threat?

336
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,119
No, it's not.

337
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,655
But if l'm gonna help you,
you must be honest with me.

338
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:20,486
- Why are you having Sarah followed?
- What?

339
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,326
- Why won't you grant your wife a divorce?
- Because she married me for my money.

340
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,327
lf l give her a divorce,
she gets half.

341
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:33,001
lf l stay married, she gets what l give her.

342
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,540
Oh, so you're punishing her.

343
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:38,599
She's making me out to be the bad guy.
That's brilliant.

344
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,974
You know, she's smarter than l thought.

345
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,946
Did she tell you that l beat her?

346
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:46,814
- Are you saying that you didn't?
- l have never hit Sarah.

347
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:50,018
And l have never hit a woman.

348
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:56,789
Now, why don't you just run along
before l have to change my answer.

349
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,234
Sarah!

350
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,811
Sarah!

351
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,543
Just tell me what happened.

352
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:29,623
He came in here,
and he was out of control.

353
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,154
Did he hit you?

354
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,066
Did he--
No.

355
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,466
Not this time...

356
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,964
but he threatened me.

357
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,345
He threatened to kill me.

358
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,112
What? Why?

359
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:53,415
Because of you. Because he hates you.

360
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,748
He hates me? What did l do?

361
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:00,455
You made me fall in love with you.

362
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:09,725
Maybe it would just be safer for me
if we weren't together right now, okay?

363
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,892
For both of us.

364
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:18,201
Oh, l don't know, Harrison, you know.

365
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:23,871
Then l'm just giving in to him.
l'm giving him exactly what he wants.

366
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:29,377
God, what can l do? He comes over here
and l'm helpless to protect myself.

367
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,920
Maybe you shouldn't be helpless.

368
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,152
What are you saying?

369
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:38,059
l should take a self- defense class
or go buy a gun?

370
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,120
You wouldn't be helpless.

371
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,399
Look at me.

372
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:47,604
l know a guy.

373
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,872
You know a guy?
Yeah.

374
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:55,171
He could set you up today with a gun.

375
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:02,514
- Do you love me?
- You know l do.

376
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,213
Then trust me.

377
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:09,716
l know a guy.

378
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,396
<i>911. </i>
<i>Yes, this is Sarah Webb. </i>

379
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,493
<i>Are you okay? </i>
<i>My husband just-- </i>

380
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:21,197
<i>Speak up, ma'am. </i>
<i>Your husband just what, ma'am? </i>

381
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,466
<i>Hit me. </i>

382
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,433
<i>I'm bIeeding. </i>

383
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,170
<i>Is he there with you now? </i>
<i>No, he drove away. </i>

384
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,679
<i>PIease hurry, if he comes back, </i>
<i>he threatened....</i>

385
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:32,216
<i>He said he wouId kiII me. </i>
<i>Where are you? </i>

386
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:34,148
<i>Oh, my God, he's here. </i>

387
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,983
<i>Andrew, stop it. PIease. </i>

388
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:41,848
A friend of mine in the DA's office tracked
it down from a year ago last December.

389
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:43,393
He was lying.

390
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:47,692
- What's that?
- Nothing. Just thinking out loud.

391
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:51,858
So, Harrison knows
you're investigating his girlfriend?

392
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:55,097
lt's for his own good, Mere.
You gotta trust me.

393
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:58,003
So what happened
when the police showed up at her house?

394
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,909
The husband was gone,
the police issued a warrant for him.

395
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:02,674
- And?
- And nothing.

396
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:06,613
Sarah went in the next day to make sure
they dropped all the charges.

397
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,912
- Why?
- Classic battered woman syndrome.

398
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,887
l see it all the time.

399
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:15,721
lf you're done with your research project,
l really have a ton of work to do.

400
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,820
- Thanks, Mere. l owe you.
- Yeah, you do.

401
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,296
Well, if it's home protection
you're looking for...

402
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,566
l would say a semi- automatic,
nine millimeter.

403
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,932
- l sell a lot of those.
- Nine millimeter, what does that mean?

404
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,034
lt's the size of the bullet.
lt's like what cops use.

405
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:37,672
Of course there's a good argument
to be made to stepping it up a bit...

406
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,809
to 10 millimeter or 45.
Both very good choices.

407
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,419
What about this?

408
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:46,787
Sure. lf your home's being invaded
by grizzly bears.

409
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,721
The nine millimeter is fine.
Good choice.

410
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:53,320
Does the little lady want me to wrap it up
or is she gonna wear it home?

411
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,424
l can't do this. Harrison, l'm sorry,
l can't do this.

412
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,933
Whoa, hey.

413
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,137
We talked about this.
You need it.

414
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:05,737
What does it solve? l mean, do you think
that it gives me my life back?

415
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,745
And besides, l read somewhere,
what was it...

416
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:12,246
that my own gun is more likely
to be used against me.

417
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:15,650
- Hey, you want me to hold it?
- No, Harrison, it's--

418
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,210
'Cause l will.

419
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:21,321
You need it,
but you don't want it in your house.

420
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,758
So l'll keep it. Problem solved.

421
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,724
And if he ever gives you a hard time...

422
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,593
all you got to do is call me.

423
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,696
l don't know. l've already gotten you
so mixed up in all of this.

424
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,266
We're in this together now.

425
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:43,707
Wrap it up, Serge.

426
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,711
God, l hate this.

427
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:59,595
l know you don't want to talk to me,
but l need you to listen.

428
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:15,301
So, you wanted to talk to me?
Please.

429
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,280
Look, l'm sorry.

430
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,713
About Sarah. For doubting her.

431
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:30,188
l know her husband's a bad guy.
l know everything.

432
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,226
lt's cool.

433
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:35,764
- That's big of you, Tru. l mean, that's--
- l'm not done.

434
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,699
Because you're still in danger.

435
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,966
Damn it, Tru.
Why can't you leave well enough alone?

436
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,803
You apologized. And now this. You know...

437
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,575
have a great night.

438
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,440
Hey, Harrison, wait.

439
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,148
You're carrying a gun.

440
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:56,483
Hey, yeah, don't give me any gun- safety
lectures, l know my way around a piece.

441
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,986
Oh, my God.

442
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,024
Do you think Harrison
could ever kill someone?

443
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,080
<i>Yes. </i>

444
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,883
You killed him.

445
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,023
What are you talking about?

446
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:08,657
You're gonna kill him.
You're gonna kill Andrew tonight.

447
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,998
What are you talking about?
Why would you say that?

448
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:16,234
Because l know.
You know what?

449
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:19,943
Every single thing
that's gonna happen today.

450
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,637
What are you, psychic all of a sudden?

451
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:25,773
lt's not psychic. At least l don't think so.

452
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,819
l mean, l'm not sure
what the name for it is scientifically.

453
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,720
But in layman's terms, l relive days.

454
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,016
You relive days?

455
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,527
People ask for my help. Dead people.

456
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:43,565
l know, l already told you that.
But then the day restarts...

457
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,869
and l have a chance
to save them from dying.

458
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,899
lt doesn't happen every day.

459
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:53,032
Not that that makes it
any less strange, but....

460
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,907
How do you think l knew your card?

461
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,310
Take this.

462
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,948
How do you think l knew
who was gonna win the ball game?

463
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:04,079
- Even you were curious.
- Okay, Tru, l love you, you know that.

464
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,485
But you need help. A lot of it, okay?

465
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:07,956
You see that waiter?

466
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,927
ln two seconds,
l bet you he drops his tray.

467
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,524
Oh, what are you talking--

468
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,599
And that guy across the room?
Tru--

469
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,536
He's gonna stand up
and profess his love for his girlfriend.

470
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,232
l love this girl!

471
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,335
What's going on?

472
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:31,415
ls this one of those reality shows
where you try to freak a guy out?

473
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:34,610
ln one minute, your cell phone's
gonna ring. lt's gonna be Sarah.

474
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:38,178
Upset and in trouble. Listen to me.
She's gonna ask you to come see her.

475
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:41,123
You're gonna run out of here,
you're gonna kill her husband.

476
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:44,559
You're gonna kill her husband
and be arrested for his murder tonight.

477
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:48,065
Look, you had me with the waiter,
and lover- boy, okay? But this?

478
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,532
This is a little wack, don't you think?

479
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:11,415
Hello?

480
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,123
lt's Sarah. Says she needs me.

481
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,703
Harrison, wait.

482
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,367
l'm going, Tru.
You can't.

483
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,878
She needs me.
l love her and she needs me.

484
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,245
You can't save her.
lt's not your responsibility.

485
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,477
lf you go there tonight,
you're gonna kill him.

486
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:43,918
- But he deserves what he gets.
- And then what? You end up where?

487
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,081
ln jail for life, or worse?

488
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,723
What? Do you want me to be like Dad?

489
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:51,694
Stand by helplessly and watch
the woman l love get murdered?

490
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,390
ls that what you want?

491
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:56,328
- Don't make her into Mom, either.
- What?

492
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:01,601
Harrison, she's not Mom.
Don't make this about saving Mom.

493
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:05,036
Look, l don't even know
what you're talking about.

494
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,512
Harrison.

495
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,014
Look at me.

496
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:14,741
Would you look at me?

497
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,811
l'm 22 years old.

498
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:20,585
And one way or another,
l've lost everyone l've ever loved.

499
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:24,219
Our mother to a bullet,
our father to lack of interest...

500
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,559
Meredith to coke and ambition.
Don't you see?

501
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,531
l can't lose you, too.

502
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,198
Otherwise l'll have no one left.

503
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,935
l'm cursed because l can see the future.

504
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,042
And if you go there right now,
l'll have no one.

505
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,238
Without you, l am all alone.

506
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,712
You will never lose me, Tru.

507
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,183
But l have to go.

508
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,585
l gotta go.

509
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,649
Har...

510
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:13,001
Taxi.

511
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:15,634
Hello.

512
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:18,738
Thought you'd like to know,
Andrew Webb was cited for speeding...

513
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,943
on December 20 of last year.

514
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,452
Actually, l don't think this is the best time.

515
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,751
ln California.
<i>So? </i>

516
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,325
So, that's the same night
that Sarah called 91 1 here.

517
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,793
<i>Remember, who actuaIIy saw Andrew</i>
<i>that night? </i>

518
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,696
Only Sarah.
The cops never found him. Why?

519
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:37,124
Because he wasn't there.

520
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,859
He won't divorce you?

521
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:42,861
Oh, my God. She set him up.
She's setting Harrison up.

522
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,302
She married me for my money.

523
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,877
Mere, let me ask you a question
about divorce law.

524
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:51,312
lf you divorce your husband in this state--

525
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:53,543
You get half community property.

526
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,711
- And if you kill him?
- You go to jail.

527
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,117
What's this about?

528
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,816
But if you have someone else kill him,
you get it all...

529
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,257
and the poor schmuck goes to jail.

530
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,500
You said it was gonna be unlocked.

531
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,270
l was surprised when you called me.

532
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,568
l thought you couldn't stand
being around me.

533
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:20,133
Usually l can't.
Except when my electrician is unavailable.

534
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,235
Charming as always, Sarah.

535
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:25,047
All right, your wiring looks fine.

536
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:30,713
How can you listen to this music?
l can't even hear myself think.

537
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,986
- Could you hear that?
- No. l didn't hear anything, Andrew.

538
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,765
Okay, l heard that. Andrew, be careful.

539
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,536
- All right, just call the police.
- Okay.

540
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:17,956
Kill him, Harrison.

541
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,596
Kill him or he'll kill us both.

542
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:32,865
No.

543
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,503
- l can't.
- You're a coward.

544
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,211
l may be...

545
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:46,621
but, God, l'm not a killer. l can't do it.

546
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,128
You are now.

547
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:56,265
Your blood is in my house,
your prints are on the gun.

548
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,269
Luckily, l was able
to wrestle it away from you.

549
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,463
Sarah.

550
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,972
Take my advice and claim self- defense...

551
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:09,103
although that would be hard to prove
with you breaking in and all.

552
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,371
<i>91 1. </i>

553
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,044
Yes, hi.

554
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,110
l would like to report a murder.

555
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,485
My husband is dead.

556
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,157
What is going on here?

557
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,822
Conspiracy to commit murder, l'd say.

558
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,459
l got the strangest phone call today.

559
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:34,669
l know you don't want to talk to me,
but l need you to listen.

560
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,903
Some girl begged me
to wear a bullet- proof vest.

561
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:50,111
l would have protected you.

562
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:54,053
You know that, right?

563
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:59,486
Goodbye, Sarah.

564
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:12,499
You should've taken half.

565
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:26,985
You know, l'm not sure l can buy
that whole"reliving a day" thing.

566
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,957
Can't say l blame you.

567
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,822
But let's say that l did...

568
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,756
if what you said is true.

569
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:39,159
Do you think yesterday l killed him?

570
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,168
l don't know. Maybe.

571
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:48,606
Probably.

572
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,508
How's your head?

573
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,519
lt hurts. Like my pride.

574
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:03,557
Of course, if you can really do
what you say...

575
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:09,826
l'll tell you,
we've really turned a nice profit.

576
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:15,895
l already did.

577
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,758
<i>So, I took your advice. </i>

578
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:38,290
<i>We came back to my apartment, </i>
<i>James and me. </i>

579
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:39,522
We just talked.

580
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,497
<i>You just taIked? </i>
Yeah.

581
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:45,424
Good, Linds. l'm proud.
<i>And you know what I reaIized? </i>

582
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:49,561
That James is one boring guy.
So l just slept with him.

583
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,801
l figured that was one way to shut him up.

584
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:53,707
And?
<i>It was nice. </i>

585
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,771
lt was very nice.

586
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:01,515
We're going for sushi tomorrow night.
Good thing l didn't take your advice, huh?

587
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,412
Yeah. Good thing.

588
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:06,955
Oh, you made it.
l wasn't sure if you would.

589
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,925
- You were right, Davis.
- l was? About what?

590
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,622
l think there is a reason l'm here.
A good one.

591
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:17,093
Yeah. l thought you might come around.

592
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,880
<i>Presidents. $1,600. </i>
<i>1979. </i>

593
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,940
- Hey, Tru.
- Hey, yourself.

594
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:37,215
lt's a slow night.
Not one pickup since lunch.

595
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,122
These guys are such brainiacs.

596
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,784
The only questions l know
are about <i>GiIIigan's IsIand. </i>

597
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:47,457
What are orchids?

598
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:48,589
<i>What are orchids? </i>

599
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:49,690
<i>FIowers. $1,600. </i>

600
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:50,961
What, a rerun?

601
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:54,266
<i>...are sometimes known</i>
<i>as crane fIowers. </i>

602
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:56,071
Not for you.
