[Tru sighing]

671
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,716
TRU: No. Never.

672
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,657
-You okay?
-Better now.

673
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:37,322
Why don't you relax?
There's just one thing l gotta do.

674
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,736
MR. DAVlES: [On phone] <i>Leave a message</i>
<i>at the beep.</i>

675
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:44,673
Hey, Dad. lt's Tru.

676
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,537
l know we haven't talked in a while...

677
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:52,842
but l want you to know l'm doing okay.

678
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,278
l have a new job.

679
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,948
l guess you could say l help people.

680
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:03,794
Sometimes, if l'm lucky, they even help me.

681
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:07,396
That's why l'm calling.

682
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:14,002
Because l know how hard it is
for two people to find each other.

683
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:18,173
Especially when one of them
doesn't want to be found.

684
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,875
So, good night, Dad...

685
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:26,806
l hope you're happy and well, because l am.

686
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:32,454
And from now on,
you don't have to try to find me...

687
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,252
because suddenly...

688
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,320
l don't feel lost.

689
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,654

690
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:51,400
Sorry.

691
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,709
Long day.

692
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,508
Tell me about it.
