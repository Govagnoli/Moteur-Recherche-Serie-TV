678
00:39:57,841 --> 00:39:59,832
Why didn't he say anything?

679
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,412
Maybe he thought there was time.

TRU: Hey, stranger.

681
00:40:25,302 --> 00:40:27,770
We've gotta stop meeting like this.

682
00:40:28,805 --> 00:40:29,965
Do we?

683
00:40:31,574 --> 00:40:34,941
-Tru, l understand--
-l got something pointed out to me today.

We never have as much time as we think.

685
00:40:38,648 --> 00:40:39,876
Meaning?

686
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,415
l don't want to stand around
and wait for someday to come.

687
00:40:43,787 --> 00:40:46,085
l want to make it work with us.

688
00:40:47,957 --> 00:40:49,857

689

say that you couldn't or wouldn't before...

691
00:40:58,301 --> 00:41:01,395
what's gonna keep us
from going in the same circles?

This weekend, let's talk.

695
00:41:19,222 --> 00:41:20,849
TRU: About everything.

696
00:41:27,697 --> 00:41:28,789
Okay.

TRU: l tried to call, but you weren't around.

699
00:41:51,254 --> 00:41:53,051
l saved a life today.

00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:56,588
That's good.

701
00:41:57,227 --> 00:41:58,990
Jack tried to stop me.

702
00:42:00,997 --> 00:42:02,794
TRU: You were right, Davis...

703
00:42:03,867 --> 00:42:05,892
and l should've listened.

704
00:42:06,669 --> 00:42:09,433
But l didn't want to hear
what you were saying.

705
00:42:10,874 --> 00:42:12,808
So l'm just really sorry that--

706
00:42:12,876 --> 00:42:17,404
-l'm sorry, too. l just kind of lost--
-Davis, just let me do this, okay?

707
00:42:18,648 --> 00:42:22,482
You said that l'm different
because of this gift that l have...

708
00:42:23,186 --> 00:42:26,451
and l've gotten to a place
where l can accept that.

709
00:42:28,057 --> 00:42:32,551
But what l don't want to be is alone.

710
00:42:34,631 --> 00:42:37,191
And l wanted so badly to believe in Jack...

711
00:42:37,267 --> 00:42:41,226
that l ignored the one person
who's been with me all along.

713
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:49,076
l needed to know there was someone else
out there who was like me.

714
00:42:49,712 --> 00:42:53,876
But Jack, he's not even close.

715
00:42:55,118 --> 00:42:56,608
No, he's not.

lt's not just supernatural theory.

That every force
has an equal and opposite force.

00:43:14,804 --> 00:43:19,173
l should've said something sooner,
but l didn't have any real proof until today.

You're right about Jack. He is not like you.

722
00:43:23,546 --> 00:43:25,571
