1
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,307
Drop those lights down!

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,311
Check the sound again.
I'm still hearing feedback.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,043
I don't care what you told them, Marty.
I'm not gonna sing.

4
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:20,314
My friend at <i>The Times</i> says
they'll send their best photographer.

5
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,617
I don't know what I'd do without you.

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,423
Hi.

7
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:38,704
Hi.

8
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,508
Will you be moving sometime today,
or should I go change in my car?

9
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:49,741
Sorry.

10
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:53,012
You know this room
is only for contestants, right?

11
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,081
I am a contestant.

12
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,721
Right, of course you are.

13
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,559
My name's Jackie.

14
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:06,360
No offense, sweetie,
but I'm not looking to make friends today.

15
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,660
I'm looking to win.

16
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:22,747
- Hello?
- Tru Davies?

17
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,181
<i>May I ask who's caIIing?</i>

18
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,810
Sorry, how rude of me.
Michelle Carey, <i>Post Dispatch.</i>

19
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,979
The newspaper.
<i>Some peopIe think so.</i>

20
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:32,047
Anyway, I was wondering
if I could ask you a few questions.

21
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,525
Actually, I'm not interested
in a subscription.

22
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,425
<i>That's not why I'm caIIing.</i>

23
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:40,398
I've been looking through police reports
over the past several months. All sorts:

24
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:44,426
an attempted murder- for- hire scheme,
suspected mass poisoning, and so on.

25
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:49,338
And the only thing all these
very different crimes have in common is...

26
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,740
well, you.

27
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,179
I'm not sure I understand--

28
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,239
<i>In aII the cases I've Iooked at...</i>

29
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:01,083
<i>you were cited by the wouId- be victim</i>
<i>as the reason he or she was stiII aIive.</i>

30
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,782
Every time. It's really quite remarkable.

31
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,654
I'm sure it's some sort of coincidence.

32
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,056
Well, that's just it. I'm not.

33
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:12,222
For a city morgue worker, you spend
a lot of time in the police blotter.

34
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,323
You know, now really isn't a good time.

35
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,833
<i>ShouId I caII you Iater?</i>

36
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,027
Maybe I could just call you.

37
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,970
Fine. The paper will find me wherever I am.

38
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,435
- I look forward to your call.
- Great.

39
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:43,886
Help me.

40
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,642
I am not depressed. I'm just--
Single.

41
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,717
Linds, Luc and I
just weren't meant to be.

42
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:11,322
If you ask me, he'll be begging
to get back with you any day now.

43
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,824
Anyway, I'd better run.

44
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,656
That's right, you've got
that beauty pageant thing today.

45
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,458
I still can't believe
you talked your firm into running it.

46
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:23,025
I know. They're also letting me pick
one of the judges, so I had this brainstorm.

47
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,229
Since they're looking for a regular girl...

48
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:28,330
who better to choose one
than a common man.

49
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,568
Don't tell me. Harrison.

50
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,870
And your girlfriend
knows nothing about this?

51
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,608
Not a thing. She trusts me completely.

52
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,876
- You're not getting cold feet now, are you?
- Me? Please.

53
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:43,445
With yours truly on the judges panel,
I can practically guarantee...

54
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,617
that your daughter
will be the next Miss Fresh Face.

55
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,251
"Practically"?

56
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,888
There're three judges on the panel.
I'm only one of them.

57
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,558
Listen, Harry,
Angela made it this far on her own.

58
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,897
Your proposal,
as creative as it may be...

59
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:59,961
is null and void should Angela finish
any lower than, let's say...

60
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,505
first place?

61
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,241
Marlon, be reasonable, man.

62
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,338
I am.

63
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,682
You pay me four large right now,
and I'm reasonable.

64
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:15,018
You make sure Angela wins,
I'm also reasonable.

65
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,955
Anything else, I'm not so reasonable.

66
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,528
Hey.
You're here early.

67
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,230
I'm not staying.
I want to return this to County Records.

68
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,397
- Your mom's autopsy report?
- Yeah.

69
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,168
- Anything new?
- No.

70
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:39,905
Standard B and E gone bad.
Single bullet, massive blood loss.

71
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:43,915
I only read it 15 times, and still think
there's something I must have missed.

72
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:47,350
Tru, if I may,
sometimes there is just a single bullet.

73
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,317
A lone gunman, a tragic death.

74
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,958
Sometimes, the truth
is exactly what it appears to be.

75
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,463
- What makes you say that?
- Eight years of working here.

76
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,691
I just wish I thought so, too.

77
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,090
See you tonight.

78
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,168
Yeah.

79
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,006
Hello?

80
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:09,267
I knew it.
I knew this girl was gonna be trouble.

81
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,470
Two minutes before the pageant starts,
and this finalist drops out.

82
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,877
- Know what this means?
- You're one girl short?

83
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,848
Yeah, exactly.
Now I need to find a replacement.

84
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:22,354
Someone fabulous to fill in.
Someone fabulous, just like--

85
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,982
- Not a chance.
- Tru, come on.

86
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,494
Listen, someone who holds your hair
when you throw up, I'm your girl.

87
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,961
Need a ride to the airport? Look no further.

88
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,225
But beauty pageants
is where I draw the line.

89
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:37,897
- It'll be fun.
- I'm so sorry, but it's just not happening.

90
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,639
<i>Thanks anyway, Tru.</i>
Bye.

91
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:46,505
Hello, and welcome to
the First Annual Miss Fresh Face Pageant.

92
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,415
<i>Now Iet's join our judges</i>
<i>in weIcoming our first contestant.:</i>

93
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,112
<i>Miss AngeIa Todd.</i>

94
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,650
<i>AngeIa's a recent graduate of OakviIIe....</i>

95
00:05:56,723 --> 00:06:00,159
By the way, I was checking out
the contestants backstage.

96
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:03,354
Angela girl, very impressive.

97
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:08,262
Smart as a whip,
and quite the pleasing disposition.

98
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,665
<i>I Iike rock.</i>

99
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,236
But that's just me.

100
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:15,671
<i>Okay, AngeIa. If you couId have</i>
<i>dinner with any figure from history...</i>

101
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,106
<i>who wouId you have dinner with?</i>

102
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,408
<i>That's a good question, Chuck.</i>

103
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,709
<i>I'd have to say KeIIy CIarkson.</i>

104
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:32,649
<i>AngeIa, Iet me cIarify.</i>
<i>Any figure from history--</i>

105
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,249
<i>KeIIy CIarkson.</i>

106
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:35,985
Wow!

107
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,723
<i>AngeIa, thank you.</i>

108
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,757
Wasn't she great?

109
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:41,857
Wow.

110
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,266
There is a girl with conviction!

111
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,601
An all too rare quality
in our young people today.

112
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,102
Excuse me.

113
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,207
- Miss Walker?
- Yes, Mr. Barnes?

114
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,807
- We have a problem.
- We do?

115
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:04,845
- I am fired?
- I'm sorry, okay?

116
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,459
Julian Barnes said
you were playing favorites...

117
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,792
- trying to influence the other judges.
- That's crazy.

118
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:13,195
I know, but he's the boss.

119
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,757
But what about you and me,
and the sharing of your work...

120
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,430
and all that stuff?
Doesn't that count for anything?

121
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,166
Of course it does.

122
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,641
That's why I saved you a seat
right in the front row.

123
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,935
Perfect.

124
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,751
Tru?
Luc.

125
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:39,784
I'm glad I ran into you, because
I wanted to talk to you about something.

126
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:40,917
In person.

127
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,723
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, it's just....

128
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:48,296
Look, this isn't easy to say,
but I'm gonna try.

129
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,230
If you ask me, he'll be begging
to get back with you any day now.

130
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,776
Take your time.
These things are important.

131
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:01,544
Yeah, that's why I wanted to talk to you
face to face.

132
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,217
Now that we're not together anymore...

133
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:08,014
it's inevitable
we're gonna start dating other people.

134
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,681
And since we work together,
I know that could be awkward.

135
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:14,248
That's why I wanted you to know
that I'm going on a date tonight.

136
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,351
Oh.

137
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:19,330
I hope I did the right thing. I just didn't
want you finding out some other way.

138
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:22,231
No, of course. I appreciate that.

139
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,433
Anyway, I should get to work.

140
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,502
It's funny. We've known each other
for three months...

141
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:36,241
and this is the first time
I've left a conversation before you did.

142
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,318
Hello?
<i>It's me.</i>

143
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,149
And I need you now.

144
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,052
Can it wait?
<i>Yeah...</i>

145
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:48,025
- if you want to see me in a full body cast.
- I'll be there as soon as I can.

146
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,623
Sorry, but I've got to run.

147
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,635
Why aren't I surprised?

148
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,701
<i>She graduated with honors</i>
<i>from the IocaI community coIIege...</i>

149
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,334
<i>and Jackie majored in education.</i>

150
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,206
Let me get this straight.
You convinced your girlfriend...

151
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,544
to make you a judge
in order to rig the voting...

152
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,083
so the daughter of your loan shark
would finish first?

153
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:15,245
You know,
that's a very poorly constructed sentence.

154
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:18,051
I hardly know what you're talking about.

155
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:23,026
Fine, yes. That's why
I need to borrow $4, 000 from you.

156
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,858
I don't have $4, 000.

157
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:29,658
I figured. So, I don't know, $40
and tomorrow's winning lottery numbers?

158
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:34,538
<i>Now teII us, Jackie, why shouId you</i>
<i>be the next Miss Fresh Face?</i>

159
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,368
<i>I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm sorry.</i>

160
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,446
<i>Okay. Moving right aIong.</i>

161
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:47,247
That poor girl.
These pageants can be rough.

162
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,351
Yeah, and I thought I had problems.

163
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:54,052
Let me ask you, if you don't pay this guy,
what would he do to you?

164
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,923
I'll put it this way.

165
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,856
I may be asking for your help tonight
from beyond.

166
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,256
Harrison.

167
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,961
I'm joking.

168
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:08,639
You start saving dead people, and
suddenly you lose your sense of humor.

169
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:12,067
Don't worry. I'll think of something.

170
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,520
- I'm having a really nice time.
- Me, too.

171
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,226
This might sound like a strange question...

172
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:33,725
but you have no reason to run off
in the middle of the meal, do you?

173
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:38,096
No. Not unless you ask me to.

174
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,806
How about we make a deal?

175
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:47,378
I won't ask you, if you don't volunteer.
Sounds perfect.

176
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,683
<i>Okay, Iadies and gentIemen.</i>

177
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,653
<i>And the votes are in</i>
<i>from our remaining judges.</i>

178
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:58,053
<i>Now, the first runner- up...</i>

179
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:02,185
<i>who wiII step in shouId our winner</i>
<i>be unabIe to perform her duties is...</i>

180
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:05,196
Don't say"Angela Todd." Do not say--

181
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,856
<i>...Miss AngeIa Todd!</i>

182
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:12,838
Oh, crap.

183
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,451
<i>And the officiaI new face</i>
<i>of JuIian Barnes Cosmetics...</i>

184
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,988
<i>winner of the cash prize,</i>
<i>the modeIing contract...</i>

185
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,923
<i>and the Iifetime suppIy of cosmetics is...</i>

186
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,495
<i>Miss AIex ReynoIds!</i>

187
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:51,568
<i>We're aII as excited</i>
<i>to have Miss ReynoIds aboard as you are.</i>

188
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:55,978
<i>But what do you say we give her a chance</i>
<i>to freshen up before taking more photos?</i>

189
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,043
Seriously. My makeup must be a mess.

190
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,715
Thank you.

191
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,381
<i>Thank you, Iadies and gentIemen.</i>

192
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,891
- All right, we're out of here.
- What's up?

193
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,156
Let's just say some people
have some major anger issues.

194
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,828
We can't get out this way.

195
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,695
- Why not?
- Because we need a pass.

196
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,565
Excuse me, Frank.
I was a judge, remember?

197
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,066
Come on.

198
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:25,043
Man, I was so close. All I had to do
was convince the other two...

199
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:28,274
and I would've been....
Hey, track star, pick up the pace here.

200
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:31,646
You should stop borrowing money
and getting into these situations.

201
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,686
Okay, Dad.

202
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:39,352
- Did I imagine that or....
- I think it came from over there.

203
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:44,560
I don't know if right now is a good time
to be taking the scenic route.

204
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,294
What happened?

205
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:51,359
It's Jackie.
She was like this when I came in.

206
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,335
Go call the police now.

207
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,008
So she's....

208
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,135
Dead.

209
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,013
They just always seem to find you,
don't they?

210
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,811
Unfortunately, yes.

211
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,649
So, is....

212
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,754
- So, is now when it happens?
- What?

213
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,356
When she asks for help. The dead chick.

214
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,985
I don't know when it happens.
It just happens.

215
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:19,929
Do me a favor. Go stand outside the door.
We need to keep the crime scene intact.

216
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,832
Sorry, but I have got to see this.

217
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,903
There's no guarantee it's gonna happen.

218
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,268
Even if it does,
you won't remember it tomorrow...

219
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,739
because it wouldn't have happened yet.

220
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,536
Yeah....

221
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,145
I think I'm just gonna wait outside.

222
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:43,781
Help me.

223
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,227
<i>Hey, it's Tru.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

224
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,598
<i>Hi, this is MicheIIe Carey</i>
<i>at the</i> Post Dispatch.

225
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,366
Tell you what.

226
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:07,878
Since I seem to have missed you at home,
why don't I just give you a call at work?

227
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,053
Just once.

228
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,519
Just once I'd like to go somewhere
and have everyone stay alive.

229
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:23,994
Is that too much to ask?

230
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:27,157
- You really want me to answer that?
- No, actually I don't.

231
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,531
- What do you know about the victim?
- Not much.

232
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:33,002
Just that she broke down and ran off
during her Q and A section.

233
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,540
Well, those questions can be tough.

234
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,474
So I'm told.

235
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:38,905
Anything on the body?

236
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,674
There was some nasty discoloration
under her eyes.

237
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,647
- Puffy?
- More like burned.

238
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,980
Doesn't ring any bells, but I'll look into it.

239
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,543
Let me know. First things first,
I've got to convince Jackie to drop out.

240
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,590
Not like she's gonna win anything tonight.

241
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,319
What, and shatter her dreams
of becoming Miss Fresh Face?

242
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,520
No, I'm gonna save her life.

243
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:00,722
Hey.

244
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,225
If a reporter named Michelle Carey calls
looking for me...

245
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,601
just don't answer any questions.

246
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,407
Questions? What kind of questions?

247
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:12,542
The kind we don't want to answer.

248
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,438
That kind. Right.

249
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,185
I'm going on a date tonight.

250
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,723
Hey, Tru, I was hoping I'd run into you.

251
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:35,665
- Yeah?
- Yeah, the reason is--

252
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,397
Actually, there's something that
I've been wanting to talk to you about.

253
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,563
Okay.

254
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,039
It's just now that
we're not together anymore...

255
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,508
it's inevitable
we'll start dating other people.

256
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,943
And us working together,
things might get awkward.

257
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:51,414
I just wanted to let you know
that it's fine with me.

258
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,811
Really?

259
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,819
I just hope you find someone
that makes you happy.

260
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:56,616
I just hope you find someone
that makes you happy.

261
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,789
But I thought that, I mean....

262
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,424
- I got to run.
- Go. Yeah, right.

263
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:17,764
Tru.

264
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:21,039
I was just gonna call you. This is so perfect.

265
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,580
Really? What's going on?

266
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,742
One of the girls just dropped out,
two minutes before the pageant.

267
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,878
- And I need someone fabulous to fill--
- I'm in.

268
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,154
- Really?
- Yeah, whatever you need.

269
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,318
Wow, I'm shocked. I totally thought
it was gonna be a long shot.

270
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,055
So should I get backstage?

271
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,121
- Yeah, I'll get you a pass. Just wait here.
- Okay.

272
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,293
Hey, Harr.
What are you doing here?

273
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,907
You know, stuff.

274
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,632
Don't tell me.

275
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,212
So, who kicked it? Me?
What, was I the one?

276
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,714
No, not you. One of the girls.

277
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,809
- Don't tell me it was Angela Todd.
- Her name's Jackie.

278
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,883
Man, can you believe it?
Murder at Lindsay's fashion show...

279
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,222
- where I'm a judge and you're--
- A contestant.

280
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:09,624
Oh, my God.

281
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:11,586
You?

282
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,032
I'm sorry, I didn't....

283
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,625
- It's the only way to get close to her.
- Yeah.

284
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,432
While you're having a good laugh...

285
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,497
let me just mention
that your little scheme isn't gonna work.

286
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:23,597
What's that?

287
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,110
Fixing a beauty pageant for
your loan shark? What were you thinking?

288
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,238
It's hard enough saving these people...

289
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,942
without always having
to bail your ass out of trouble.

290
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,213
But that's our thing, right?

291
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,848
Just try not to be so obvious.

292
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,756
You got yourself kicked off
the judging panel yesterday.

293
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,225
Good to know.

294
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,990
Okay, come on, let's get you backstage.

295
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:52,570
So this is the replacement?
- Yeah, Tru.

296
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,835
I need you to get into your dress
for the first round. Eveningwear.

297
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:58,409
This was so last- minute.
I don't have a dress.

298
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,445
You can borrow one of mine.

299
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:04,573
Help me.

300
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,408
- Thanks.
- Don't worry about it.

301
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,977
Couldn't decide, so I brought four.

302
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:13,682
It sounds like a plan.
Okay, let's kick it into high gear, girls.

303
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,191
Hi, I'm Tru.
Jackie.

304
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:20,061
I heard a rumor there was a late entry.
So you must be the new girl?

305
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,531
Nice to meet you.

306
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,400
So what, you just decided over breakfast
that you wanted to be Miss Fresh Face?

307
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,995
Actually, yeah.

308
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:29,840
Unbelievable.

309
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,945
They'll let anybody into these things.

310
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,514
- Is she always so warm?
- Afraid so.

311
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,914
But it's not just Alex. It's all of them.

312
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,510
I guess catty competition's
just not my thing.

313
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,785
I thought it could be fun,
but these girls will do anything to win.

314
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,827
<i>Before we start,</i>
<i>I'd Iike to introduce you to our judges.</i>

315
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,886
<i>PIease weIcome</i>

316
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,625
<i>Mr. JuIian Barnes!</i>

317
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,263
<i>Our next judge is a former spokesmodeI</i>
<i>who, if you ask me...</i>

318
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,364
<i>looks like she shouId be back here</i>
<i>with the rest of our finaIists.</i>

319
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,999
<i>I know JuIian thinks so,</i>
<i>and that's why he married her!</i>

320
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,375
<i>Ladies and gentIemen,</i>

321
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,946
<i>And our man on the street,</i>
<i>Mr. Harrison Davies.</i>

322
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:29,030
There's something I got to tell you,
and it's gonna sound weird, but--

323
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,332
Come on, you look so serious
all of a sudden. Let's talk inside.

324
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,770
Tyler? What are you doing here?

325
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:43,177
- Jackie, I uh, look, I missed you and...
- I told you not to come.

326
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,341
Just listen to me, okay?
Go away!

327
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:49,820
- The least you can do is give me a chance.
- Tyler, there is nothing left to say.

328
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:53,415
I live here now. This is my home.
You have to go.

329
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:57,553
No, I'm not leaving. I came
halfway across the country to see you.

330
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,119
Is there a problem in here?

331
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,927
Please. Just leave.

332
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,728
- But--
- You heard the lady.

333
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,826
- Probably a good idea.
- Don't bother.

334
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,394
This way, sir.
I'll find my way out.

335
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,402
My ex. Not exactly a clean break.

336
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:20,107
I moved here to start over.
I never thought he'd come looking for me.

337
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:22,745
Trust me, men are never predictable.

338
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:30,859
- Here, try this one. It'll look great on you.
- Thanks.

339
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,801
<i>Last question:</i>
<i>If you couId have dinner....</i>

340
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,239
- What did he do?
- Nothing. In fact, he's been quite pleasant.

341
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,369
The problem is it's come to my attention
that Mr. Davies' sister...

342
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:51,108
has been slotted in as an alternate.
Conflict of interest.

343
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,543
- So, I should....
- Can him.

344
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,699
Am I in the right place?

345
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,267
I was told to speak with Tru Davies.

346
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,870
Actually, she's not here.
But I'd like to help you.

347
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,139
I could help you. Or not.

348
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,612
I need to pick up a death certificate
for a relative of mine.

349
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:29,778
- Actually, you'd have to go through--
- County Records, right?

350
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:33,152
I was there all morning.
When they finally got around to helping...

351
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:36,388
they said they'd lost the original
and to come here for a new one.

352
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,828
Unfortunately, any request
for a new certificate has to go through--

353
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:43,231
Please don't tell me
I have to go back to County Records?

354
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,930
I'm already four hours
late for work.

355
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:52,441
Well, I guess we could bend the rules
just this once.

356
00:21:56,782 --> 00:22:01,617
- I'm sorry about your loss, Miss....
- Park. Susan Park.

357
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,622
<i>Now, Jackie's wearing a stunning design...</i>

358
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,659
<i>from the JuIian Barnes coIIection</i>
<i>of fine formaIwear.</i>

359
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:27,538
I hope she's kidding with that ass.
Ouch!

360
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:28,772
Big much?

361
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,377
What's between you two, anyway?

362
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,010
The only thing between me and Jackie
is the crown.

363
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,520
No one else stands a chance against me.

364
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,488
No offense.

365
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:43,757
It's just a contest. If you don't win,
it's not the end of the world.

366
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,620
You so don't get it.

367
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,624
<i>Winning something Iike this</i>
<i>puts a girI on the map.</i>

368
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,635
To where?
Mini- malls of the Eastern Seaboard?

369
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,273
Got to start somewhere.
And a word of advice.

370
00:22:56,341 --> 00:23:00,573
If I got into the finals because
my best friend was running the show...

371
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,242
maybe I wouldn't talk so much.

372
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:11,045
Hey.

373
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:14,058
- You looked really great out there.
- Thanks.

374
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:18,823
I've been thinking about what you said
about these girls, this whole thing.

375
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,525
And the truth is, I feel the same way.

376
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,234
So here's an idea. Let's drop out.

377
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,803
- Excuse me?
- I'm serious. Let's get out of here.

378
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:31,603
We could be halfway through a pizza
before they even know we're gone.

379
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,743
It's tempting, I have to admit.

380
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,877
But I signed up for this thing,
and I should see it through.

381
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:39,382
It can't get any worse, right?

382
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:43,547
Anyway, you being here is proof
that not all the competition is so bad.

383
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:47,350
There's something that
I didn't get a chance to tell you before--

384
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,291
I know. I walk too fast.

385
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:52,524
And if I'm not careful,
I'm gonna take a nasty spill in these heels.

386
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,622
No, that's not it. It's something else.

387
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,792
About tonight.
<i>Tru Davies.</i>

388
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,569
I don't know how to tell you this, but--

389
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:00,638
<i>Tru Davies?</i>

390
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,707
Talk later. Walk now. Go.

391
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,706
Good luck.

392
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:14,050
<i>Ladies and gentIemen, Tru's</i>
<i>a Iate entry into our IittIe pageant here.</i>

393
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:18,453
<i>But I'm sure she's as deserving</i>
<i>a candidate as we've seen here tonight.</i>

394
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:30,157
This is why I wanted you
to come home with me.

395
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:33,720
I always thought I'd propose to you
once we got there...

396
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:37,757
but after we argued this morning,
I figured it was now or never.

397
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,164
So, what do you say, Jacks?

398
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,705
I want to.

399
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:47,672
And I love you, Ty, more than anything.

400
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:52,877
But I need some time to think about it.

401
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:04,291
Whatever you need.
I'm not going anywhere.

402
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:20,302
Here we are: Terrance Park,
68 years old, massive coronary.

403
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,778
Korean male.

404
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,344
Uncle by marriage.

405
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:31,649
It says here the original certificate
was signed by a Jessica Park.

406
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,016
My cousin.
She was gonna come with me today...

407
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,989
but it was so hard for her to come here
the first time.

408
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:42,261
- It's never easy coming to the morgue.
- And yet you do it every day.

409
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:46,159
You must be a very strong person...

410
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,530
working here all alone,
surrounded by death.

411
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,477
Well, actually I oversee a small staff.

412
00:26:57,248 --> 00:27:01,184
Tru, right? My cousin said
she dealt with somebody by that name.

413
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:04,944
Yeah.

414
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,389
Actually, I should go
get you the new certificate.

415
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,258
I'm not in any hurry.

416
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,262
Besides...

417
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:17,968
I like talking to you.

418
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:20,471
Yeah.

419
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,448
Are you okay?

420
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,775
This might sound like a strange question...

421
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:38,311
but you're not gonna run off somewhere
in the middle of dinner, are you?

422
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:42,121
- Not unless you want me to.
- No, I don't. No, not at all.

423
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,127
'Cause that's one thing I can't stand...

424
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:48,063
when a girl just ups and leaves
right in the middle of a meal, because my--

425
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,033
Ex used to do that.

426
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,833
- Did I mention that already?
- Three times.

427
00:27:56,374 --> 00:28:00,276
Look, Tabitha,
you seem like a really great girl.

428
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,445
The truth is I thought I was ready
to start dating again...

429
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,118
but maybe I'm just not.

430
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:11,480
Great. Maybe you could've thought of that
before you asked me out.

431
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:16,082
You know what? Here, watch me run out
in the middle of the meal.

432
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,189
This was a waste of a night.

433
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:21,121
What did he do?

434
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,391
<i>KeIIy CIarkson.</i>

435
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,862
<i>Okay, AngeIa, thank you.</i>

436
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,240
<i>And now for our next contestant,</i>
<i>Tru Davies!</i>

437
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,120
<i>So, Tru, your bio says...</i>

438
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:46,123
<i>that you work the night shift in a morgue?</i>

439
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,891
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

440
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:50,621
<i>So teII us, how do you spend your time...</i>

441
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:53,459
<i>when you're not out tagging toes?</i>

442
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,692
<i>I heIp peopIe.</i>

443
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,899
<i>So, voIunteer work?</i>
<i>You couId say that.</i>

444
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,703
Alex, this is the last time
I'm gonna ask you, do you understand?

445
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,210
<i>Did you bring it or not?</i>

446
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:12,181
It's here somewhere.
I can't give it to you. At least, not yet.

447
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,151
I haven't got time for this.
I shouldn't be out here...

448
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,018
in the middle of a Q and A.
Careful, Jules.

449
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,852
The judges take off for bruising.

450
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,291
You know you could go out there
with two black eyes and still win.

451
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,886
I knew that tape would persuade you.

452
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,565
Don't worry,
you've got all the votes you need.

453
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:30,760
That's all I wanted to hear.

454
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,634
You're up next.

455
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,010
<i>Tru, in 50 words or Iess...</i>

456
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,779
<i>teII us why you shouId be</i>
<i>the next Miss Fresh Face.</i>

457
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:52,212
<i>I wish I couId, Chuck, but I'm kind of</i>
<i>on a tight scheduIe. Thanks.</i>

458
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:58,760
- What was that all about?
- It's just the crowd. I got nervous.

459
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,660
Too bad, because
I think the judges like your look.

460
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:05,100
<i>It's the one and onIy</i>
<i>Miss Jackie Connors. Let's give her....</i>

461
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,603
Speaking of judges, where's Harrison?

462
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:07,763
Speaking of judges, where's Harrison?

463
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:11,304
- Yeah, I sort of had to fire him.
- You what?

464
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,969
Once you entered,
there was a conflict of interest.

465
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,546
It wouldn't have been fair
to keep him on the panel.

466
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:20,573
<i>Now teII us, Jackie, why shouId you</i>
<i>be the next Miss Fresh Face?</i>

467
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,950
<i>I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm sorry.</i>

468
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:27,380
Okay.

469
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,889
Guess I don't have to worry
about her anymore.

470
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,258
<i>Our next contestant is....</i>

471
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,524
I thought you said
she was your main competition.

472
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:37,659
Not after that performance.
Right now, she'd be lucky to beat you.

473
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:51,475
All this paperwork....
I bet you don't get out on many dates.

474
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,083
Actually, women kind of think I'm strange.

475
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:06,694
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

476
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,600
- Can you excuse me a second?
- Yeah.

477
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,107
Hello?
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

478
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:21,907
I just heard back from the tox lab,
and the discoloration around the eyes...

479
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:26,178
is consistent with the topical application
of an organophosphate.

480
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,545
<i>Most IikeIy</i>
<i>a pesticide of some sort.</i>

481
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,555
You're saying she died
because someone rubbed it on her skin?

482
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,818
<i>Organophosphate is</i>
<i>a powerfuI nerve agent...</i>

483
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:37,350
and once it gets into the nervous system,
it shuts the lungs down.

484
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,828
- It's instant asphyxiation.
- Lovely.

485
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,732
What about you? Any suspects?
<i>I had two, and now it's none.</i>

486
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:45,193
What happened?

487
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,728
I thought it was the angry boyfriend,
but he was only looking to propose.

488
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,173
Then it was another contestant,
but Jackie just bombed the Q and A...

489
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,540
<i>so she's not a threat to anyone.</i>

490
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,078
There's got to be someone.

491
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:56,613
<i>That's the thing. There isn't.</i>

492
00:31:56,714 --> 00:32:00,548
Jackie's one of the sweetest girls
I've ever met. No one wants to hurt her.

493
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:03,109
And she's gonna be murdered
in the next 30 minutes.

494
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,779
I got to go. I'll be in touch.

495
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:09,486
Exactly who's going to be murdered
in the next 30 minutes?

496
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:19,263
Hey, I saw what happened out there.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

497
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,168
- I'm leaving.
- What?

498
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:26,036
This whole night is fake.
The girls look fake...

499
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,646
the winner is fake,
and absolutely none of it matters.

500
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:34,446
I wanna help you, but I need you to tell me
exactly what's going on.

501
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:37,784
It's Alex.
She's got something on one of the judges.

502
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:41,150
- Some sort of tape or--
- She's blackmailing him?

503
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:45,123
To make sure
she's declared the winner.

504
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:48,457
Which means
nothing we did here today counted...

505
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,331
because the whole stupid thing was fixed.

506
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,537
Oh, God, look at me.

507
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,270
I'm all Tammy Faye.

508
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:07,345
I can't let Ty see me like this,
or he might take back his proposal.

509
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,289
And the discoloration around the eyes...

510
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:17,226
<i>is consistent with the topicaI appIication</i>
<i>of an organophosphate.</i>

511
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,660
Most likely a pesticide.

512
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,934
Jackie, stop! Don't use that.

513
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,976
- Why not?
- Because it'll kill you.

514
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:37,136
Why would Alex's makeup remover kill me?

515
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,978
- Wait, this isn't yours?
- Mine's already packed.

516
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:42,679
I was just gonna borrow some of hers.

517
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,212
But if this is Alex's....

518
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,258
Oh, my God.

519
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:52,494
Then she was supposed to die yesterday,
not you.

520
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,500
No offense, Tru,
but you're sort of freaking me out.

521
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,510
Sorry, it's just that
I think someone's trying to kill Alex.

522
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,876
Why would anyone want to kill her?

523
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:13,474
Aside from the fact
she's a total B- I- you- know- what.

524
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:16,616
You said she had some sort of tape
that she was using...

525
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,917
to blackmail one of the judges?

526
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:23,919
To win a third- rate beauty contest
is not exactly grounds for murder.

527
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:28,056
I don't think it's about the pageant.
I think it's about the tape.

528
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,757
Look, maybe all the pressure
is getting to you.

529
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:33,668
I don't know, but I think I'm gonna....

530
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,172
You know, I got to say,
I'm glad we met today.

531
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:45,841
<i>It was an absoIuteIy miserabIe time,</i>
<i>and I don't ever want to do it again.</i>

532
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,875
But having you around....

533
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,920
It made a world of difference.

534
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:06,134
I asked you a question.

535
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:08,866
Let's get you your certificate
and you can be on your way.

536
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:12,636
I don't want the certificate.
And my name isn't Susan Park.

537
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,876
You Michelle Carey?
I have nothing further to say to you.

538
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,281
- What do you not want me to know?
- Please leave.

539
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:23,479
Is it something do with her
mysterious appearance at crime scenes?

540
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:26,250
Her uncanny knack
for saving the lives of strangers?

541
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:29,384
Listen, you are so far off. This is ridiculous.

542
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,190
Then enlighten me.
Tell me what's really going on here.

543
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,855
Nothing is going on here.

544
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:37,059
- You're saying that I imagined all of this?
- Absolutely.

545
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,593
Then let me tell you something else
that I might have imagined.

546
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:44,402
I did a little research, and it turns out
Tru isn't the first young woman...

547
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:49,378
to mysteriously pop up in the nick of time
and save the lives of total strangers.

548
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,146
There was another before her.

549
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,615
I asked you to leave.

550
00:35:56,621 --> 00:36:01,149
Tell Tru I'm sorry I missed her,
but I'll be sure to catch her another time.

551
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:24,513
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>about this, Mr. Barnes.</i>

552
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,785
<i>I'II make you a deaI.:</i>
<i>You caII me JuIian...</i>

553
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,048
<i>and I'II caII you Miss Fresh Face.</i>

554
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:35,650
<i>But I'm not Miss Fresh Face.</i>
<i>Not yet, but you wiII be.</i>

555
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:38,286
<i>- Promise?</i>
<i>- AbsoIuteIy.</i>

556
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:45,369
<i>Now why don't we drop the chit- chat?</i>

557
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:57,178
<i>And the officiaI new face</i>
<i>of JuIian Barnes Cosmetics is...</i>

558
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,550
<i>Miss AIex ReynoIds!</i>

559
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:03,510
Oh, crap.

560
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:15,354
Big surprise?

561
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:19,094
I'm sorry there can only be
one Miss Fresh Face.

562
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,400
But we'd like you to try again next year.

563
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:24,066
Maybe next year I could bring a tape.

564
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:26,671
I don't understand.

565
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:31,473
Tell you what, I could arrange a screening.
Maybe that would help jog your memory.

566
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:36,249
- So, what do you want? Money?
- I want you to turn yourself in.

567
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,447
- For what?
- For trying to kill Alex tonight.

568
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:42,982
What the hell are you talking about?
Why would I hurt her? She won. It's over.

569
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:45,726
You're right.

570
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:49,091
Your motive went away as soon
as she won the contest, but who....

571
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:55,332
<i>What do you say we give her a chance to</i>
<i>freshen up before taking any more photos?</i>

572
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,497
Your wife.

573
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,098
Seriously.
My makeup must be a mess.

574
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,937
I would stay here if I were you.

575
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:07,313
Unless Miss Fresh Face is okay
with having a corpse for a spokesmodel.

576
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:10,579
What?

577
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:13,281
Adrian didn't like that
you slept with her husband...

578
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:16,258
<i>so she added a speciaI ingredient</i>
<i>to your makeup remover.</i>

579
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,592
<i>Something that cIeanses</i>
<i>and kiIIs pesky bIackmaiIers.</i>

580
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,367
You poisoned my makeup?

581
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:33,036
What better way to kill a beauty queen?

582
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,779
You can't prove any of it.

583
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:38,872
Not my department.
But as soon as I turn over the evidence...

584
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:42,077
they're gonna have
plenty of questions for you.

585
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,714
Adrian, I had this handled.
What did you do?

586
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:51,085
She made a fool out of you, Julian,
and she made a fool out of me.

587
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:54,323
After tonight,
her face would have been everywhere...

588
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,730
and I couldn't stand the thought of it.

589
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,837
Two days!
I'll get you everything, plus interest!

590
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,740
Sorry, buddy, too late now.

591
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:10,178
Daddy, I was looking all over!

592
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:12,977
Sorry, baby.
I just had a little business to attend to.

593
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,608
<i>It's too bad about that contest--</i>

594
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,709
- I won!
- What?

595
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:16,878
I won!

596
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:20,219
That other girl was blackmailing a judge,
so they disqualified her.

597
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,418
- Do you mean....
- I'm Miss Fresh Face!

598
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:23,517
Yes!

599
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:29,161
The scholarship, the modeling
contracts, the free cosmetics! All mine!

600
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:32,461
I got to go call Mom!
Yes.

601
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,334
That's just great.

602
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,340
I don't know what you did,
but I'm impressed.

603
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,477
Any time, baby.

604
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:52,917
Any time.

605
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:18,008
- Hey.
- Hi.

606
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:22,680
- How'd your date go?
- Honestly, not so good.

607
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,520
The truth is
the whole time I was with Tabitha...

608
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:28,319
I couldn't stop thinking
of another girl I knew.

609
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,588
Hey, remind me again why we broke up.

610
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,528
Because I was unpredictable...

611
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:38,829
and because I ran off
in the middle of sentences.

612
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,336
Because I kept secrets.

613
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:42,634
- And that bothered me?
- It did.

614
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,298
Maybe I overreacted.

615
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:47,036
Maybe I could learn to live
with those things.

616
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:50,011
No, you didn't. And you couldn't.

617
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:54,981
Because as much as I'd like to,
I'll never be able to change.

618
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,149
That's who I am.
That's who I'll always be.

619
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,950
And because of that,
I'll have to give up things.

620
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:04,289
Sometimes really great things.

621
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,622
I'm sorry, Luc.

622
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:13,100
- Don't be.
- No, I'm sorry for me.

623
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,284
- Hey, Davis.
- Hello.

624
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,891
You okay?

625
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:42,699
I will be, I guess. What about you?
Did that reporter ever call?

626
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:46,000
No. She came in.

627
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:49,072
Don't worry, I didn't say a thing.

628
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,041
Good. It's just been a long day, you know?

629
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:57,975
I don't know if I could handle reading
about myself in the morning paper.

630
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,550
She does know something, though.

631
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,956
Something that I've known for a long time.

632
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,723
Not that she'll be able to prove it.
Maybe I should've told you sooner...

633
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:15,492
but I didn't want to confuse you even more.
- Davis.

634
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:22,094
Before you, there was someone else.

635
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:26,001
A woman. She relived days.

636
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:28,873
She could prevent death.

637
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,574
Once you asked me why I believe you...

638
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,011
how I readily accept what you can do.

639
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,212
And that's why.

640
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,185
Because I met her.

641
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:47,025
And as many times as you read her file,
it's never gonna be in there.

642
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,299
It was your mother.

643
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,534
What you can do...

644
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:00,938
she could do it, too.
