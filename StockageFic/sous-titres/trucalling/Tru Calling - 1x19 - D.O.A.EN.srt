00:00:00,785 --> 00:00:02,548
<i>PreviousIy on</i> Tru Calling:

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:03,712
I relive days.

3
00:00:03,788 --> 00:00:05,722
You relive days?

4
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:09,381
This is Mr. Harper.
He will be interviewing to replace Gardez.

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,927
Hey. Jack.

6
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:13,495
Thanks for making me feel so welcome.

7
00:00:13,564 --> 00:00:15,555
It's never easy being the new guy.

8
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:18,227
- Do you like working here?
- Actually, I do.

9
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:20,103
I understand.

10
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:22,867
You do? Not everyone does.

11
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,774
That's because most people believe
that only the living need help.

12
00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:30,205
I just can't get a read on him,
for some reason.

13
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:33,580
It's like one minute he's in your face
and almost obnoxious.

14
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:36,381
The next, he's charming,
trying to be your best friend.

15
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:39,218
When Jack committed himself,
he thought he was going crazy.

16
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,957
Going crazy how?

17
00:00:41,025 --> 00:00:42,458
He thought he was reliving days.

18
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:43,818
Like me?

19
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,258
Exactly like you.

20
00:01:01,946 --> 00:01:04,710
Come on. You've got to let me talk to him.

21
00:01:04,782 --> 00:01:08,616
He was in a psych ward, Tru.
He was diagnosed as being delusional.

22
00:01:08,686 --> 00:01:11,917
And so would I, if I'd gone to a doctor
claiming to be reliving days.

23
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,890
But what makes you so sure
he's not just like me?

24
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,554
And out of all the gin joints in the world,
he walks into mine.

25
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,961
- I did.
- You were meant to.

26
00:01:21,032 --> 00:01:24,399
Maybe he was meant to,
but we won't find out unless I talk to him.

27
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:28,030
And say what?"How about
this whole reliving days thing?"

28
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:29,198
Yeah, why not?

29
00:01:29,273 --> 00:01:32,538
If it's true, he'd be relieved to know
that there's someone like him.

30
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,043
The way you are?

31
00:01:35,046 --> 00:01:36,411
Okay. Yeah, sure.

32
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:39,541
It would be nice to have someone
to share the responsibility with.

33
00:01:39,617 --> 00:01:43,383
What if he's been doing it for a while?
He may know more than we do.

34
00:01:43,454 --> 00:01:45,581
That's assuming we can trust his answers.

35
00:01:45,656 --> 00:01:47,123
Come on, Davis.

36
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:51,594
You don't trust the waitress to give
you decaf till you see what pot she uses.

37
00:01:51,662 --> 00:01:55,359
Coffee's important to me.
And so are you.

38
00:01:57,268 --> 00:01:59,498
You know
I'm gonna have to talk to him soon.

39
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,798
I know.

40
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:41,810
Oh, my God!
Call 91 1.

41
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:01,287
Help me.

42
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,379
Tru.

43
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:26,481
Hi.

44
00:03:26,557 --> 00:03:29,754
You must be Randall.
I've been hearing about you all week.

45
00:03:29,827 --> 00:03:31,658
I can't stay. I have to get back to work.

46
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:34,892
But first, Lindsay tells me
it's absolutely vital that you like me.

47
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:36,365
So what can I do?

48
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:40,100
You can leave,
so we can start talking about you.

49
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:41,502
All right.

50
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:43,933
- Bye.
- Bye.

51
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,475
- Bye.
- Bye.

52
00:03:50,014 --> 00:03:51,879
Here, hold my cell.

53
00:03:55,586 --> 00:03:57,315
Okay, what's going on?

54
00:03:58,122 --> 00:04:01,489
Remember how we always said
when someone proposed to us...

55
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:05,893
we'd call the other one and the first thing
we'd say was,"Don't drop the phone."

56
00:04:05,963 --> 00:04:09,763
- Well, don't drop the phone.
- No.

57
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:14,167
Yes! He asked me last night.
He wants to get married this weekend.

58
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:15,932
What did you say?

59
00:04:16,073 --> 00:04:18,007
I asked for more time.

60
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,034
Do you love him?

61
00:04:21,112 --> 00:04:23,080
Yeah, I think I might.

62
00:04:23,147 --> 00:04:24,614
God, am I crazy?

63
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:28,015
It's not like he's a total stranger.
We dated that semester abroad--

64
00:04:28,085 --> 00:04:30,679
But you've only been back together
for a week.

65
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:32,780
Great. So we both agree I'm totally crazy.

66
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:36,349
No, not if you asked for time
to think about it.

67
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:38,755
I did.

68
00:04:40,398 --> 00:04:43,561
I told him I'd let him know
by the end of the day.

69
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:55,903
You okay?

70
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,710
If by"okay," you mean
25 minutes late for work, yeah.

71
00:04:58,783 --> 00:05:00,774
But if you're on your way out,
avoid downtown.

72
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:03,115
- Construction?
- No, there was a bad accident.

73
00:05:03,187 --> 00:05:06,247
The radio said a dump truck
plowed into the Number 6 bus.

74
00:05:06,324 --> 00:05:09,293
- There's all kinds of gridlock.
- Are we expecting any bodies?

75
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,191
I wouldn't be surprised.

76
00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:16,991
Do you ever notice how we always end up
in this hallway at the same time?

77
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:19,662
Maybe someone
is trying to tell us something.

78
00:05:22,473 --> 00:05:24,031
Anyways, I know you're in a rush.

79
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:27,009
- Right, yes. I'll see you later.
- Okay.

80
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:39,885
So, you probably heard.

81
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:44,087
A certain lovely young woman
has seen the error of her ways...

82
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:48,962
and is returning into the arms
of her man, Harrison Davies.

83
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,198
Who are we talking about here?

84
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:55,136
Who are we talking about?
Lindsay, of course.

85
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,668
She left a message.
She needs to talk.

86
00:05:58,743 --> 00:06:02,008
- It's reconciliation time, baby.
- You never know.

87
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,809
A message like that
could mean a lot of things.

88
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:07,077
You should've heard her voice.

89
00:06:07,151 --> 00:06:09,711
I could hear
how much she cares about me.

90
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,353
- Harr.
- Yeah?

91
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:16,087
She's thinking about getting married
to someone else.

92
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:18,717
What?

93
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,028
Why would you say that?

94
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:25,625
His name's Randall Thompson...

95
00:06:25,703 --> 00:06:28,536
and they've been seeing each other
for a week.

96
00:06:29,173 --> 00:06:32,404
A week? She just met the guy.

97
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:35,912
Actually, they dated
when she was studying abroad...

98
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,881
and now he's an investment banker
at Burkess and Wells....

99
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:40,974
Come on. What's he after?

100
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,852
Not everyone's on the scam, Harry.

101
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,621
He's Euro, right?

102
00:06:52,863 --> 00:06:56,128
I'm sure a green card would make
it real easy for him in this country.

103
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,258
You've never met him.

104
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,427
Don't have to.
He's working an angle...

105
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:03,769
so he can keep doing this investment
banking crap on this side of the Atlantic.

106
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:08,069
It doesn't matter what you or I think.
This is Lindsay's decision.

107
00:07:08,145 --> 00:07:10,272
Stay out of it, Harr.

108
00:07:13,818 --> 00:07:17,652
Dr. Frank Colvin,
mid- 40s, victim of a heart attack.

109
00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:19,690
Dropped on the street
a couple of hours ago.

110
00:07:19,757 --> 00:07:21,987
Time of death?
8:10 a. m.

111
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:25,261
Sorry about crashing here
after the late shift last night.

112
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:28,059
You guys should try sleeping
on that sofa in there.

113
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:32,762
I swear, this guy's the only guy in here
who feels worse than I do this morning.

114
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:40,277
What, did I miss a memo?

115
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:45,711
- That's probably not important.
- I can handle everything in here.

116
00:07:45,783 --> 00:07:47,045
You sure?

117
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,658
You know, Davis is an interesting guy.

118
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:58,422
But why do I get the feeling
we'll come here one morning...

119
00:07:58,496 --> 00:08:02,523
and all the corpses are gonna be
dressed up for an imaginary tea party?

120
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:09,565
Tru, I can appreciate the silent treatment
as well as anyone else...

121
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,939
but what's going on?
I can't even piss you off lately.

122
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:18,915
See, you want the truth.

123
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:24,449
- Davis and I, we--
- Let me save you the tap dance.

124
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:28,585
This is about the letter I got
from the Schenkman Center last week?

125
00:08:29,193 --> 00:08:31,286
- Partly.
- I had a feeling.

126
00:08:33,063 --> 00:08:36,032
- Look, I can explain that.
- You don't have to.

127
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,458
Why?

128
00:08:37,535 --> 00:08:40,971
Because I know
it can be kind of hard to explain.

129
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,700
Jack, what you thought
was happening to you...

130
00:08:47,077 --> 00:08:48,738
it happens to me.

131
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:56,876
I think we should go get a drink.

132
00:08:58,823 --> 00:09:01,383
You know,
I had my suspicions about you.

133
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,121
Running off all the time, the way
you're so invested in these people's lives.

134
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:07,528
- Why didn't you say anything?
- Why didn't you?

135
00:09:07,598 --> 00:09:10,999
- It's just, I can't believe--
- That there's two of us. I know.

136
00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:14,629
I can't believe I'm finally talking
to someone who doesn't think I'm crazy.

137
00:09:14,705 --> 00:09:17,230
- How sick are you of having--
- The same conversation...

138
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:19,208
over and over again.

139
00:09:19,543 --> 00:09:22,410
And then having to act surprised,
like you hadn't heard it.

140
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,471
- "Oh, my God. No way."
- "So interesting."

141
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:29,041
- So when did it start?
- For me, it started a while ago.

142
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,647
I woke up after a near- death experience...

143
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:34,156
and found that it was the same day
over again.

144
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:37,319
And now I had this job to do.
What about you?

145
00:09:37,695 --> 00:09:41,495
Almost a year ago now.
On the anniversary of my mother's death.

146
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:43,328
Really? Your mother?

147
00:09:43,868 --> 00:09:46,029
So bodies ask for your help, too?

148
00:09:46,103 --> 00:09:48,628
Yeah, although
it hasn't been happening lately.

149
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:51,698
Now I understand why.
Obviously, they prefer to go to you.

150
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:53,675
Can't say I blame them.

151
00:09:53,978 --> 00:09:56,139
But you've gotta admit,
it's pretty amazing.

152
00:09:56,213 --> 00:10:00,547
Being able to save people's lives,
to change things, make things right.

153
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:02,480
Is that what we're doing?

154
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:05,146
I guess I just wonder sometimes.

155
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:09,324
- About?
- Consequences. Ripples in fate.

156
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,723
How what we do affects others.
Jimmy, I got some seats over here.

157
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,624
There's a dartboard over there.
Let's go play.

158
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,367
So, who else knows about you?

159
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:24,270
First I told Harrison, and then Davis.

160
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:25,808
You told Davis?

161
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:30,040
He figured it out on his own.
He's really helped me navigate this.

162
00:10:30,114 --> 00:10:32,605
At least now I understand
why you're single.

163
00:10:32,683 --> 00:10:34,708
What's that supposed to mean?

164
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:38,620
You told Luc and he bolted, right?

165
00:10:39,123 --> 00:10:41,182
First of all, nobody bolted.

166
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:43,490
It just wasn't working.

167
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:47,086
Second of all, I never told him.

168
00:10:47,398 --> 00:10:49,923
Because you were afraid he'd bolt, right?

169
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,434
Who have you told?
Me?

170
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,099
Nobody.

171
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,599
It tends to make things complicated.

172
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,236
Speaking of bolting, I got a pickup.

173
00:11:05,349 --> 00:11:06,714
Well, thanks.

174
00:11:06,784 --> 00:11:09,685
God, it's so nice to know
I'm not in this alone.

175
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,946
Yeah.

176
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:12,511
I'll see you later tonight.

177
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,717
Or depending on the body,
maybe I'll see you this morning.

178
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:17,054
Okay.

179
00:11:19,863 --> 00:11:20,955
Hey, Lindsay.

180
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:23,966
I did it. I finally made up my mind
about Randall's proposal.

181
00:11:24,034 --> 00:11:25,092
And?

182
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,631
I said no.

183
00:11:27,705 --> 00:11:30,071
<i>And he said goodbye.</i>

184
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:34,468
He's such a great guy, Tru.
It just felt too fast.

185
00:11:34,878 --> 00:11:37,039
I am sure that you did the right thing.

186
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:40,277
The day will come when you'll tell me
not to drop the phone again...

187
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:43,149
<i>and then it'II be the right guy,</i>
<i>the one who was meant to be.</i>

188
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,847
You really believe that?

189
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:47,080
Of course, rebound girl.

190
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,451
Thanks, Tru. Good night.

191
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:53,427
Good night.

192
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:57,024
Someone's got a little extra bounce
in their step.

193
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:59,831
Someone's got a little tequila
in their system.

194
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,962
But more importantly, I talked to Jack.

195
00:12:03,774 --> 00:12:06,072
- And?
- He's just like me.

196
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:09,670
He understands everything I've been
going through because he does it, too.

197
00:12:09,747 --> 00:12:11,874
- You told him about you?
- Of course.

198
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:13,541
Was he surprised?

199
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:15,143
I guess.

200
00:12:15,853 --> 00:12:18,981
Just getting it out there was so liberating.

201
00:12:19,123 --> 00:12:21,182
And he brought up
something interesting.

202
00:12:21,258 --> 00:12:25,058
He asked if I ever thought about
how what we do could have a ripple affect.

203
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:26,255
Well, yes.

204
00:12:27,097 --> 00:12:30,294
Every time you save someone,
it changes the course of history.

205
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:31,959
You not only affect that life...

206
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:34,334
but the lives of everyone
that person will touch.

207
00:12:34,438 --> 00:12:37,066
Tru, the power that you have
is awesome:

208
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:39,706
to change history for the better.

209
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:44,809
What is it?

210
00:12:45,616 --> 00:12:48,380
It's just the way he was talking about it.

211
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:51,751
I'm not so sure
Jack always thinks it's for the better.

212
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:56,091
Could I get a hand out here?

213
00:12:57,127 --> 00:13:00,358
I got a body.
Suicide, found over at Chelsea River.

214
00:13:01,165 --> 00:13:04,692
What's going on with the good doctor?
No one came to claim him?

215
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:07,362
- That's kind of sad.
- Yeah, it is sad.

216
00:13:08,806 --> 00:13:10,034
What?

217
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:11,734
Nothing.

218
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,008
You told him, didn't you?

219
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:19,879
It's okay. You can trust him.

220
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:23,849
- Here, let me help you with the body.
- <i>Wait.</i>

221
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:26,389
What?
I didn't say....

222
00:13:28,358 --> 00:13:29,791
Here we go.

223
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,524
Help them.

224
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,634
Jack?

225
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:49,338
<i>Did you?</i>
Yeah.

226
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:52,071
Looks like they're playing our song.

227
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:01,222
So, what do you remember
about the doctor?

228
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:04,590
6' tall, mid 40s, dark blond hair.

229
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:07,459
It's 8:02. You said Colvin died around 8:10?

230
00:14:07,531 --> 00:14:08,930
According to witnesses.

231
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:11,433
Do you remember
where you picked him up?

232
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:14,130
Tru, I've never been
much of a morning person.

233
00:14:14,204 --> 00:14:15,398
<i>Come on, Jack.</i>

234
00:14:16,974 --> 00:14:19,465
3rd and Cliffwood.
<i>East or West?</i>

235
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,677
- East.
- Meet you there.

236
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:40,825
- East 3rd and Cliffwood. Where is he?
- I don't know.

237
00:14:41,265 --> 00:14:43,392
It's 8:09. He should be here.

238
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:48,029
- What?
- It might have been West 3rd.

239
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,275
Excuse me.

240
00:15:04,651 --> 00:15:06,778
I'm calling it. 8:10 a. m.

241
00:15:14,594 --> 00:15:16,789
- That man is dead because of me.
- That's not true.

242
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:19,093
I could've sworn it was East 3rd.

243
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:22,328
- We can't always be perfect.
- Have you ever lost anyone?

244
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:25,367
Yes. I understand how you feel.

245
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:29,567
It's hard to believe
anyone understands how I feel.

246
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:38,550
Dr. Frank Colvin.
He's the one that asked for help?

247
00:15:38,618 --> 00:15:41,314
Yeah, we didn't make it to him on time.

248
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:45,585
What do you mean by"we"?
Jack and I.

249
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:47,656
- Together?
- Yeah.

250
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:49,852
Thus the"and."

251
00:15:50,497 --> 00:15:52,294
So you guys talked?

252
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:57,327
Right. Sorry, I told you yesterday.
Of course, you don't remember.

253
00:15:57,771 --> 00:16:01,571
Jack and I spoke.
And, Davis, he is another me.

254
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:04,470
Really? He said that?

255
00:16:04,944 --> 00:16:06,673
It's incredible, isn't it?

256
00:16:07,814 --> 00:16:09,645
Yeah, it's incredible.

257
00:16:09,783 --> 00:16:11,182
Just one sec.

258
00:16:12,552 --> 00:16:13,712
It's Lindsay.

259
00:16:13,787 --> 00:16:17,245
I'm supposed to be meeting Randall.
This guy proposed to her.

260
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,956
Go ahead, you can take the call.

261
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,851
That's okay. I'll call her back.

262
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:26,060
Now, about what you're not saying....

263
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:30,000
I don't get it. There was two of you,
and you still couldn't save him?

264
00:16:30,804 --> 00:16:33,364
Jack got the street wrong.

265
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:37,070
- Right. Wrong street.
- Seriously, it was an honest mistake.

266
00:16:37,143 --> 00:16:40,169
When did you last make a mistake
that cost someone their life?

267
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:42,544
- Why are you being so hard on him?
- Why aren't you?

268
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:44,913
You beat yourself up
over the slightest misstep.

269
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:47,452
You're gonna give Jack a free pass
over someone's life?

270
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,681
I told you, it wasn't his fault.

271
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:53,754
What's going on with you, anyway?

272
00:16:54,027 --> 00:16:56,291
Can't you just be happy for me
that I found Jack...

273
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:58,887
or does every silver lining
have to have a cloud?

274
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:02,128
- Sometimes it does.
- I'm sorry, I can't live like that.

275
00:17:02,202 --> 00:17:04,295
I have to take victories
where I can find them.

276
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:07,965
Since when is losing someone
considered a victory?

277
00:17:08,174 --> 00:17:09,368
He's right, Tru.

278
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:12,411
Maybe we just have to admit
we lost this round.

279
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:15,105
I don't think that we have.

280
00:17:15,682 --> 00:17:18,617
It's good to see
we're all on the same page again.

281
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:21,547
- You were saying?
- I don't think this is over yet.

282
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:23,589
Dr. Colvin died of a massive heart attack.

283
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:26,386
We couldn't have stopped that
even if we got there on time.

284
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,155
And he said,"Help them," not"help me."

285
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:31,559
Maybe he was supposed to die.

286
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:35,332
lnteresting.
Everyone asks for help for a reason.

287
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:38,336
We just have to find out
what his reason was.

288
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,077
You got something to add, Davis?

289
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:48,376
I was thinking, if every rewind
is a matter of life and death...

290
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:50,882
and the doctor said,"Help them,"
you have to figure...

291
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,181
there's at least one person connected
to this man who will die today.

292
00:17:54,254 --> 00:17:55,346
<i>Maybe more.</i>

293
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:59,187
The question is: Who is it,
and can you find them before it's too late?

294
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:03,593
Since no one claimed the body yesterday,
we should start with the next of kin.

295
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,836
Lindsay, you're my best friend,
and I believe in you.

296
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:21,413
Somehow, I know you'll make
the right decision about Randall today.

297
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:23,642
All right? I'll call you later. Bye.

298
00:18:24,217 --> 00:18:26,708
How'd it sound?
Too surprised? Not surprised enough?

299
00:18:26,786 --> 00:18:30,051
It was perfect. I almost thought
you were worried she might say yes.

300
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:31,181
Not today.

301
00:18:32,025 --> 00:18:35,984
So, you think the doctor's son
is the one we're supposed to save?

302
00:18:36,062 --> 00:18:39,463
He's the next of kin and his only family.

303
00:18:45,505 --> 00:18:47,029
Can I help you?

304
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,203
Are you Marc Colvin?

305
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,404
Yeah.

306
00:18:52,745 --> 00:18:55,236
We work at the morgue downtown...

307
00:18:55,315 --> 00:18:58,148
and I'm sorry to have to tell you this...

308
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:01,311
but your father passed away this morning.

309
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:03,922
Heart attack.

310
00:19:04,257 --> 00:19:05,918
Yeah, it would be.

311
00:19:05,992 --> 00:19:10,622
We were wondering if you'd mind coming
down to the morgue to claim the body.

312
00:19:10,863 --> 00:19:14,492
I'd rather not.
Thank you for telling me about it, though.

313
00:19:15,168 --> 00:19:16,931
But you're his son.

314
00:19:18,972 --> 00:19:21,031
My father and I weren't very close.

315
00:19:21,808 --> 00:19:26,040
It's none of your business,
but he didn't exactly approve of me.

316
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:28,371
Since Frank Colvin
never claimed me as a son...

317
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:31,349
I don't think I should have to be the one
to claim him now.

318
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:35,285
Why don't you try his office?
That's where he lived most of his life.

319
00:19:50,837 --> 00:19:52,634
What's up, doc?
God!

320
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:55,596
Is Tru around?

321
00:19:55,675 --> 00:19:58,405
No, she's out in the field.
Can I take a message?

322
00:19:58,478 --> 00:20:02,812
I wanted to tell her in person.
I'll tell you anyway.

323
00:20:04,183 --> 00:20:06,378
I've got some great news about Lindsay.

324
00:20:06,853 --> 00:20:08,047
She already knows about that.

325
00:20:08,121 --> 00:20:09,952
How does she know?
I just got the message.

326
00:20:10,023 --> 00:20:13,481
Because Tru has been
talking to Lindsay about the guy all week.

327
00:20:16,963 --> 00:20:18,260
What guy?

328
00:20:18,665 --> 00:20:21,498
The guy that Lindsay
is thinking of marrying.

329
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:29,033
I didn't say anything about marriage.

330
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,435
This is awkward, isn't it?

331
00:20:34,714 --> 00:20:38,275
Only if you don't keep talking.
Come on, Davis.

332
00:20:39,786 --> 00:20:41,048
What guy?

333
00:20:44,223 --> 00:20:46,157
Randall Thompson, I think.

334
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:50,355
An investment banker with an lrish accent,
which women find so appealing.

335
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:53,024
I don't understand
why accents have such an effect...

336
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:55,158
because when you think about--

337
00:20:57,537 --> 00:21:00,370
He's foreign. He's from another country.

338
00:21:01,908 --> 00:21:03,432
He just lives here.

339
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:06,740
Suddenly, he just pops the question
and asks some chick to marry him?

340
00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:09,179
Hello? What does that say to you?

341
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,813
That he's impulsive and likes to travel.

342
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:15,382
No, I'm actually a referral.

343
00:21:15,455 --> 00:21:18,185
Dr. Colvin left me a message
asking me to come by today.

344
00:21:18,257 --> 00:21:21,317
Dr. Colvin's office, this is Grace.
Can you hold, please?

345
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:25,920
Miss Casola, the doctor will
be here soon. Please take a seat and wait.

346
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:28,330
He said 10:00 a. m. I've been waiting.

347
00:21:28,868 --> 00:21:30,665
You know what? Forget it.

348
00:21:30,737 --> 00:21:32,204
Sorry about that, Mrs. Hoffman.

349
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:36,298
Your test results will be in this afternoon,
and I'll have him call you first thing.

350
00:21:36,376 --> 00:21:39,675
Okay, bye. Hi, how can I help you?

351
00:21:40,847 --> 00:21:44,806
My name is Jack Harper,
and we're with the city morgue.

352
00:21:47,153 --> 00:21:50,213
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this...

353
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:54,350
but Dr. Colvin died from a heart attack
at around 8:00 a. m.

354
00:21:54,527 --> 00:21:56,654
We were wondering
if someone from this office...

355
00:21:56,729 --> 00:21:59,630
could come down to the morgue
to identify the body.

356
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:01,659
Right.

357
00:22:03,903 --> 00:22:06,997
We need to close for the day.
Look in the doctor's book...

358
00:22:07,073 --> 00:22:09,769
and call anyone
who's scheduled for an appointment?

359
00:22:10,877 --> 00:22:15,405
Lily is probably still waiting for him.
Someone should probably tell her.

360
00:22:15,681 --> 00:22:16,875
Lily?

361
00:22:17,717 --> 00:22:20,515
She's a waitress
at the coffee shop across the street.

362
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:23,077
She's going to community college...

363
00:22:24,657 --> 00:22:27,592
and Frank was tutoring her.

364
00:22:27,994 --> 00:22:30,758
Let us help you. It's on the way.
We'll tell her.

365
00:22:32,832 --> 00:22:35,232
So, you think
this girl might be one of"them"?

366
00:22:35,301 --> 00:22:40,204
You said it yourself. Ripples.
One person's life touches so many others.

367
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,533
How many lives did Dr. Colvin touch?

368
00:22:42,608 --> 00:22:46,305
And if Davis is right,
which one of them is gonna die today?

369
00:22:46,746 --> 00:22:48,145
Oh, my God.

370
00:22:48,614 --> 00:22:51,344
- What happened?
- He had a heart attack.

371
00:22:56,622 --> 00:22:59,523
I served him coffee every morning
for over a year.

372
00:23:00,593 --> 00:23:02,891
One day he saw me drawing...

373
00:23:03,963 --> 00:23:07,228
a sketch of the human anatomy
from my biology text.

374
00:23:07,934 --> 00:23:09,458
He corrected me.

375
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,298
On what?

376
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,201
He told me the left lung
is smaller than the right lung...

377
00:23:18,277 --> 00:23:20,438
to make room for the heart.

378
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,942
He said that
that's how he'd remembered it...

379
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:25,881
because it's like life.

380
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:28,713
The heart always comes first.

381
00:23:30,623 --> 00:23:31,920
Excuse me.

382
00:23:42,068 --> 00:23:45,663
The man Lily knew and the man
his son knew were two different people.

383
00:23:45,738 --> 00:23:47,706
You know how families are.

384
00:23:47,773 --> 00:23:51,072
They always save the most
dysfunctional stuff for each other.

385
00:23:53,746 --> 00:23:56,544
Hey, man, Lily left her book here.

386
00:23:56,616 --> 00:23:58,481
You can probably catch her
at the bus stop.

387
00:23:58,551 --> 00:24:01,384
Which one?
Down the block. The Number 6.

388
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:03,746
A bad accident.

389
00:24:03,823 --> 00:24:06,883
The radio said a dump truck
plowed into the Number 6 bus.

390
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,852
Yesterday there was an accident.
Lily's bus?

391
00:24:17,603 --> 00:24:18,729
There it is.

392
00:24:32,018 --> 00:24:34,350
Wait, stop!
Stop the bus!

393
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,012
Hold on!
Lily!

394
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,652
Stop the bus!

395
00:24:40,126 --> 00:24:41,150
Wait!

396
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:44,726
Jack, no!

397
00:24:48,968 --> 00:24:51,232
Jack, what the hell were you thinking?

398
00:24:56,108 --> 00:24:57,166
Are you telling me...

399
00:24:57,243 --> 00:25:01,043
you've never jumped in front
of an oncoming vehicle to save someone?

400
00:25:04,717 --> 00:25:06,014
Are you okay?

401
00:25:07,286 --> 00:25:08,651
I think so.

402
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:10,712
You forgot this.

403
00:25:12,692 --> 00:25:13,920
Thank you.

404
00:25:18,497 --> 00:25:21,057
So Jack stopped the bus. Okay.

405
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:24,159
That's okay. You're allowed to be wrong
about him. I forgive you.

406
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:27,103
- All right, what now?
- That's the thing.

407
00:25:27,173 --> 00:25:31,166
Yesterday you and I talked about
how one life touches so many others.

408
00:25:31,243 --> 00:25:34,770
How do I know this is what Dr. Colvin
meant when he said,"Help them"?

409
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:36,474
Anybody die in the accident yesterday?

410
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:39,177
That's just it. Luc wasn't sure.
Although Jack thinks--

411
00:25:39,251 --> 00:25:40,980
Jack thinks? What do you think?

412
00:25:41,053 --> 00:25:43,078
What I was gonna tell you,
if you'd let me...

413
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:45,623
was that Jack and I were talking
about lives touching--

414
00:25:45,691 --> 00:25:48,057
You told Jack
about what we talked about?

415
00:25:48,761 --> 00:25:50,729
Come on, it's not as if it was classified.

416
00:25:50,796 --> 00:25:53,526
I didn't even know
that you talked to me about it until now.

417
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,590
What's with you?
Why are you acting like this?

418
00:25:55,668 --> 00:25:59,160
I know it must be a big relief
to share this with someone.

419
00:25:59,238 --> 00:26:01,399
But ever since you learned
the truth about Jack...

420
00:26:01,474 --> 00:26:05,501
you're walking around with blinders on,
which is exactly what I think he wants.

421
00:26:05,578 --> 00:26:07,671
Please don't tell me you're jealous.

422
00:26:07,747 --> 00:26:09,339
I'm not jealous.

423
00:26:09,982 --> 00:26:13,611
- I'm skeptical, which you used to be.
- What's there to doubt?

424
00:26:13,686 --> 00:26:15,950
Jack's practically proven
that he's here to help.

425
00:26:16,022 --> 00:26:18,013
- Has he?
- He jumped in front of a bus.

426
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,820
To stop an accident,
which you just said yourself...

427
00:26:20,893 --> 00:26:22,554
might not have killed anyone.

428
00:26:22,628 --> 00:26:25,756
You have to ask yourself,
"Why Jack? Why now?"

429
00:26:25,831 --> 00:26:29,289
Why would the two of you
be in the same place at the same time?

430
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:32,201
<i>I know that</i>
<i>you don't want to be aIone in this...</i>

431
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:34,865
but something here isn't right.

432
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,670
And something about him isn't right.

433
00:26:54,727 --> 00:26:56,024
You okay?

434
00:26:56,762 --> 00:26:59,390
Fine. My mind's just on other things.

435
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:02,498
You feel like sharing?

436
00:27:02,902 --> 00:27:05,962
I just want to follow up a little
on Dr. Colvin's call for help.

437
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:09,667
Tru, we saved a busload of people.
Our work here is done.

438
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:12,034
You've got to learn
to take yes for an answer.

439
00:27:12,111 --> 00:27:15,603
The son might know something.
I just want to try him again.

440
00:27:15,681 --> 00:27:18,650
- All right, let me grab my stuff.
- No, it's fine. I got it.

441
00:27:18,718 --> 00:27:21,778
No reason for both of us
to be obsessive, right?

442
00:27:34,767 --> 00:27:36,291
Why should I waste my time?

443
00:27:36,368 --> 00:27:39,269
Because it's the right thing to do.
You're his son.

444
00:27:39,338 --> 00:27:41,898
I needn't pretend it meant
more to me than it did to him.

445
00:27:41,974 --> 00:27:45,740
Can't you, just for today,
do this one little thing for him?

446
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:48,376
I'm sorry to intrude.

447
00:27:49,148 --> 00:27:50,479
You again.

448
00:27:50,683 --> 00:27:55,313
Your father's body is still unclaimed,
and nobody's even come to identify it.

449
00:27:55,755 --> 00:27:58,349
What, you both go
to the same school of etiquette?

450
00:27:58,424 --> 00:28:01,882
- I have my reasons. Good ones.
- We're not here to judge.

451
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:04,853
You didn't know my father.

452
00:28:06,365 --> 00:28:10,597
He was the man who convinced
a 15- year- old kid that he was a failure...

453
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:14,435
because he wanted to do something
other than follow in his father's footsteps.

454
00:28:14,507 --> 00:28:18,876
It was years before I realized that
"artist" didn't mean"disappointment."

455
00:28:21,113 --> 00:28:25,777
Okay, so your father wasn't a saint.
But he tried to help people.

456
00:28:26,085 --> 00:28:29,282
Did you know he was tutoring someone?
A girl in junior college?

457
00:28:29,355 --> 00:28:33,485
Really? Was she studying biology?
Something medical?

458
00:28:36,428 --> 00:28:37,417
Yeah.

459
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:42,592
Dad was a decent guy
if you met his expectations, but if not....

460
00:28:44,937 --> 00:28:48,498
Let's just say that I know how it feels
to go unclaimed.

461
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:52,441
Excuse me.

462
00:28:58,184 --> 00:29:00,516
He wouldn't return my phone calls.

463
00:29:01,053 --> 00:29:03,954
I just wanted to ask him
to help me choose a mortuary...

464
00:29:04,023 --> 00:29:06,116
pick out one of Frank's suits.

465
00:29:06,892 --> 00:29:09,690
All the things
that should be done by family.

466
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:13,356
I guess I am alone in this.

467
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,124
Help them.

468
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:19,399
No, you're not.

469
00:29:22,775 --> 00:29:25,676
- You Randall Thompson?
- How'd you....Where's my assistant?

470
00:29:25,744 --> 00:29:28,611
- Sit down. This will only take a second.
- Who are you?

471
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:30,046
Harrison Davies.

472
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:32,083
Lindsay's Harrison.
Right.

473
00:29:32,151 --> 00:29:34,847
I'm only gonna say this once.
You listen up.

474
00:29:35,454 --> 00:29:38,719
If you think you can take
this sweet, innocent girl...

475
00:29:39,024 --> 00:29:42,084
get some green card,
and break her heart...

476
00:29:42,595 --> 00:29:45,462
I don't care where you go,
I don't care what you do...

477
00:29:45,531 --> 00:29:47,897
but I'll find you and break you.

478
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:07,918
My grandfather gave this to
my grandmother when they got engaged.

479
00:30:07,918 --> 00:30:08,407
My grandfather gave this to
my grandmother when they got engaged.

480
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:11,149
My father gave it to my mother.

481
00:30:11,422 --> 00:30:15,085
I was hoping to get it resized
so that Lindsay could wear it...

482
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:17,859
when we move to London.

483
00:30:21,198 --> 00:30:22,256
London?

484
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,368
The firm's sending me back.
I've been promoted.

485
00:30:25,436 --> 00:30:27,996
And I want to take Lindsay with me...

486
00:30:28,405 --> 00:30:29,804
as my wife.

487
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:34,511
See, I don't need a green card. I need her.

488
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,178
I keep seeing him all day.

489
00:30:43,287 --> 00:30:45,187
Ever since you told me.

490
00:30:46,423 --> 00:30:48,152
It happens for a while.

491
00:30:48,992 --> 00:30:51,620
After my mom died, I saw her all the time.

492
00:30:51,962 --> 00:30:55,363
At the grocery store,
in the carpool line at school.

493
00:30:56,633 --> 00:30:58,157
It will stop.

494
00:30:59,336 --> 00:31:01,236
What if I don't want it to?

495
00:31:07,044 --> 00:31:08,568
Gardenias.

496
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,346
Frank gave them to me for my birthday.

497
00:31:13,383 --> 00:31:16,079
This may be none of my business but....

498
00:31:18,088 --> 00:31:19,487
I loved him.

499
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,489
Did he know?

500
00:31:23,494 --> 00:31:25,462
I never said anything...

501
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:32,431
but somehow I always thought
there would be time...

502
00:31:32,503 --> 00:31:34,903
to let him know what he meant to me.

503
00:31:35,906 --> 00:31:37,999
There is no time, is there?

504
00:31:46,617 --> 00:31:49,313
Frank was always doing things like this:

505
00:31:50,187 --> 00:31:54,089
taking on other doctors' lost causes,
helping people.

506
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:56,991
"Lost causes"? Meaning terminals?

507
00:31:57,327 --> 00:32:01,730
Her HCG levels were elevated,
which usually signifies inoperable cancer.

508
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:06,159
But Dr. Colvin ordered additional tests
to be run on her blood samples.

509
00:32:06,737 --> 00:32:08,261
May I see that?

510
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:16,306
According to this, the patient
recently suffered a miscarriage.

511
00:32:16,613 --> 00:32:19,104
Pregnancy would cause
her levels to be off.

512
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:22,385
That means she was misdiagnosed
by her previous doctor.

513
00:32:22,452 --> 00:32:25,853
She's not going to die.
I'm sure Frank meant to tell her.

514
00:32:25,923 --> 00:32:27,550
"Nadine Casola."

515
00:32:27,724 --> 00:32:30,784
Miss Casola, the doctor will
be here soon. Please take a seat.

516
00:32:31,195 --> 00:32:33,755
She was in your office today, but she left.

517
00:32:33,831 --> 00:32:36,322
- Yes.
- So she still believes she's dying.

518
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,802
Grace, you have to call her. She needs
to hear this news right now. Please.

519
00:32:40,871 --> 00:32:42,270
Oh, dear.

520
00:32:46,677 --> 00:32:48,144
It's ringing.

521
00:32:49,646 --> 00:32:51,739
- There's no answer.
- Keep calling.

522
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:54,072
Hello?

523
00:32:54,151 --> 00:32:57,143
Sounds like you're in a rush.
The son put you onto something?

524
00:32:57,221 --> 00:32:58,586
<i>I know who was supposed to die.</i>

525
00:32:58,655 --> 00:33:01,818
Nadine Casola. A suicide.
She was misdiagnosed.

526
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:03,621
I'm on my way to the....

527
00:33:03,694 --> 00:33:06,254
I got a body.
Suicide, found at Chelsea River.

528
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,321
Wait a minute.
You picked her up yesterday.

529
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:09,831
<i>The suicide at CheIsea River.</i>

530
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,926
Why didn't you say anything
on seeing her at the doctor's office?

531
00:33:13,003 --> 00:33:14,800
Maybe I just didn't recognize her.

532
00:33:14,872 --> 00:33:19,366
Sometimes suicides don't look all neat
and tidy when you get to the scene, Tru.

533
00:33:19,443 --> 00:33:22,435
A life is in danger.
Can't we argue about this later?

534
00:33:22,512 --> 00:33:24,980
Wait, Jack. Why didn't you tell me
what you knew?

535
00:33:25,048 --> 00:33:27,482
I've got to go, Tru. My cell's dying.

536
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:03,419
Nadine!

537
00:34:08,191 --> 00:34:09,715
We're too late.

538
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,427
- I gotta see for myself.
- Why are you being like this?

539
00:34:13,563 --> 00:34:15,963
- I'm trying to do my job.
- So am I.

540
00:34:16,867 --> 00:34:20,132
You don't want me to save her.
You want her to die.

541
00:34:20,837 --> 00:34:24,034
- So help me God, if you don't let go!
- Tru, think a minute.

542
00:34:24,107 --> 00:34:27,804
Nadine Casola is supposed to die.
Why should you change that?

543
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:29,812
Because someone asked me to.
Because I can.

544
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,509
That's not good enough.
You have no idea what you're doing.

545
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:36,677
If you save someone who shouldn't
be here, there are consequences.

546
00:34:36,753 --> 00:34:40,189
Do you think I'm messing up
some grand plan? Maybe I am the plan!

547
00:34:40,257 --> 00:34:43,192
If someone needs my help,
I am not gonna stand by and watch.

548
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,251
And I'm not gonna stop you.

549
00:34:48,098 --> 00:34:49,190
This time.

550
00:34:55,672 --> 00:34:57,264
What did you do?

551
00:35:05,382 --> 00:35:07,782
You're okay. You're gonna be okay.

552
00:35:08,852 --> 00:35:11,480
Stay with me, okay? It's gonna be all right.

553
00:35:15,058 --> 00:35:17,891
Come on, Nadine. It's okay.
You're gonna be fine.

554
00:35:19,062 --> 00:35:22,361
Yes, I want to report an emergency.
I need an ambulance.

555
00:35:22,432 --> 00:35:25,401
I have an overdose.
She's still breathing.

556
00:35:26,169 --> 00:35:28,160
<i>You're gonna be fine, Nadine.</i>

557
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:40,906
Hi.

558
00:35:42,152 --> 00:35:43,813
What are you....

559
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:46,355
I never returned your key.

560
00:35:48,191 --> 00:35:51,558
Harrison, tonight isn't--
I heard about the proposal.

561
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,388
And?

562
00:35:55,899 --> 00:35:57,958
And I checked this guy out.

563
00:35:58,435 --> 00:36:01,370
- I know it pisses you off.
- Harrison.

564
00:36:02,572 --> 00:36:04,472
You need to know something...

565
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:08,568
before you make a mistake
that you'll regret for the rest of your life.

566
00:36:08,845 --> 00:36:10,403
You should go. You shouldn't be here.

567
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,947
Say yes.

568
00:36:13,216 --> 00:36:14,478
Say yes.

569
00:36:18,488 --> 00:36:20,251
He is the real deal.

570
00:36:20,657 --> 00:36:24,821
He's the better guy.
A better guy than I could be for you.

571
00:36:26,263 --> 00:36:28,629
At least, right now.

572
00:36:31,735 --> 00:36:33,760
And he really loves you.

573
00:36:37,174 --> 00:36:38,402
Say yes.

574
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:50,318
Thank you.

575
00:36:59,296 --> 00:37:01,287
I see you chose the suit.

576
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:05,965
He wore it one night
when he was going to a concert.

577
00:37:06,503 --> 00:37:08,698
He looked very distinguished.

578
00:37:09,873 --> 00:37:13,274
I still want to help.
If there's anything I can do....

579
00:37:21,918 --> 00:37:23,613
Hi. Grace?

580
00:37:24,221 --> 00:37:25,586
I'm Lily.

581
00:37:26,223 --> 00:37:28,851
I came to give back Dr. Colvin's book.

582
00:37:29,993 --> 00:37:31,221
Please.

583
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:34,819
Hi.

584
00:37:34,898 --> 00:37:35,922
Hi.

585
00:37:36,299 --> 00:37:37,994
- Here.
- Thank you.

586
00:37:39,569 --> 00:37:42,402
Frank spoke so highly of you.

587
00:37:44,274 --> 00:37:45,468
You, too.

588
00:37:46,209 --> 00:37:48,268
Did you like the gardenias?

589
00:37:48,445 --> 00:37:50,379
How did you know about that?

590
00:37:51,148 --> 00:37:55,175
God, he agonized over
which ones to get you: gardenias, roses.

591
00:37:55,485 --> 00:37:58,886
He finally chose gardenias
because of what they meant.

592
00:38:01,091 --> 00:38:02,524
Unspoken love.

593
00:38:10,467 --> 00:38:13,868
I'll put this in his medical collection.

594
00:38:16,473 --> 00:38:19,067
It was very nice to finally meet you.

595
00:38:20,877 --> 00:38:23,573
I'm really sorry it had to be this way.

596
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,189
It's so ironic.

597
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,090
Frank touched so many people.

598
00:38:39,162 --> 00:38:42,598
And the one person
he wanted to help the most, he couldn't.

599
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:45,527
- You mean....
- His son.

600
00:38:47,871 --> 00:38:50,499
Frank just never knew
how to tell him.

601
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:00,382
Thanks for coming.

602
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:03,817
You said on the phone I had to sign
something, then this would be over.

603
00:39:03,887 --> 00:39:05,514
Right, a notarized statement.

604
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:08,353
I get your signature,
we can release the body...

605
00:39:08,425 --> 00:39:11,656
and you'll never have to think
of your father again.

606
00:39:12,295 --> 00:39:13,990
Please, come in.

607
00:39:14,297 --> 00:39:16,128
Grace, I've got a lot of work to do.

608
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:19,691
She told me that this whole thing
was gonna just take a few....

609
00:39:27,377 --> 00:39:30,107
He's been buying them
from galleries for years.

610
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:38,984
I don't....

611
00:39:41,491 --> 00:39:43,482
He wanted to be with you.

612
00:39:44,461 --> 00:39:46,861
<i>This was as cIose as he couId get.</i>

613
00:39:53,637 --> 00:39:56,128
I thought that he didn't....

614
00:39:57,841 --> 00:39:59,832
Why didn't he say anything?

615
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,412
Maybe he thought there was time.

616
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,990
Hey, stranger.

617
00:40:25,302 --> 00:40:27,770
We've gotta stop meeting like this.

618
00:40:28,805 --> 00:40:29,965
Do we?

619
00:40:31,574 --> 00:40:34,941
- Tru, I understand--
- I got something pointed out to me today.

620
00:40:35,011 --> 00:40:37,741
We never have as much time as we think.

621
00:40:38,648 --> 00:40:39,876
Meaning?

622
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,415
I don't want to stand around
and wait for someday to come.

623
00:40:43,787 --> 00:40:46,085
I want to make it work with us.

624
00:40:47,957 --> 00:40:49,857
I understand that you're serious.

625
00:40:49,926 --> 00:40:53,453
But what's different now that's
gonna make things better between us?

626
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:58,160
Unless there's something you want to
say that you couldn't or wouldn't before...

627
00:40:58,301 --> 00:41:01,395
what's gonna keep us
from going in the same circles?

628
00:41:03,907 --> 00:41:07,172
This time there is something different.

629
00:41:15,952 --> 00:41:18,512
This weekend, let's talk.

630
00:41:19,222 --> 00:41:20,849
About everything.

631
00:41:27,697 --> 00:41:28,789
Okay.

632
00:41:42,779 --> 00:41:45,339
I tried to call, but you weren't around.

633
00:41:51,254 --> 00:41:53,051
I saved a life today.

634
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:56,588
That's good.

635
00:41:57,227 --> 00:41:58,990
Jack tried to stop me.

636
00:42:00,997 --> 00:42:02,794
You were right, Davis...

637
00:42:03,867 --> 00:42:05,892
and I should've listened.

638
00:42:06,669 --> 00:42:09,433
But I didn't want to hear
what you were saying.

639
00:42:10,874 --> 00:42:12,808
So I'm just really sorry that--

640
00:42:12,876 --> 00:42:17,404
- I'm sorry, too. I just kind of lost--
- Davis, just let me do this, okay?

641
00:42:18,648 --> 00:42:22,482
You said that I'm different
because of this gift that I have...

642
00:42:23,186 --> 00:42:26,451
and I've gotten to a place
where I can accept that.

643
00:42:28,057 --> 00:42:32,551
But what I don't want to be is alone.

644
00:42:34,631 --> 00:42:37,191
And I wanted so badly to believe in Jack...

645
00:42:37,267 --> 00:42:41,226
that I ignored the one person
who's been with me all along.

646
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:49,076
I needed to know there was someone else
out there who was like me.

647
00:42:49,712 --> 00:42:53,876
But Jack, he's not even close.

648
00:42:55,118 --> 00:42:56,608
No, he's not.

649
00:42:58,588 --> 00:43:03,491
It's not just supernatural theory.
It's scientific fact.

650
00:43:03,693 --> 00:43:07,026
From Eastern philosophy
to Newton's Third Law of Motion...

651
00:43:07,096 --> 00:43:09,030
they all say the same thing.

652
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:14,236
That every force
has an equal and opposite force.

653
00:43:14,804 --> 00:43:19,173
I should've said something sooner,
but I didn't have any real proof until today.

654
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:23,267
You're right about Jack. He is not like you.

655
00:43:23,546 --> 00:43:25,571
He is the opposite of you.

656
00:43:26,616 --> 00:43:29,608
- You save lives and he....
- Takes them.
