-l didn't need you to protect me.

674
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,274
l never did.

675
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:18,041
What l needed was for you to let me in.
To be a part of your life.

676
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,783
But now.... God, after this....

677
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,689
Luc, please. lt won't happen again.

678
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:28,389
lt will.

[Sad instrumental music]

680
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,996
Maybe not the same way, but it will.

681
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:36,089
'Cause we're going in circles here, Tru.

682
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:39,728
We're running into the same problem
over and over again.

683
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:43,303
l just don't think one more chance
is gonna change that.

685
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:04,259
l went through hell this weekend.
And for what?

686
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:06,694
To save the life of a serial killer.

687
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:10,764
Now he's in prison. Some people
would say that's worse than death.

688
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,700
All l wanted was two days, Davis.

689
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:17,070
Two lousy days away from this job
and this thing that l do.

690
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,539
But l couldn't get away.

691
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:22,134
lt followed me, and it cost me Luc
because l couldn't tell him the truth.

692
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:23,235
You have a calling.

693
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:25,838
TRU: A calling is something
you're destined to do.

694
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:29,442
Something that gives your life meaning,
that makes you happy.

695
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,250
What l do feels more like a curse.

696
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:35,089
[Davis sighs]

697
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,389
Look, you were chosen for a reason.

698
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:40,191
DAVlS: Whoever gave you this gift
knew what they were doing.

699
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:43,165
They saw the same things in you
that l see in you:

700
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:46,328
strength, compassion, conviction.

701
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:51,404
Curse or calling, love it or hate it,
you are the right person for the job.

702
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:54,341
DAVlS: There's no doubt in my mind.
