1
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,438
Yeah. Come on.

2
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,077
Harrison?

3
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:22,487
Call it even.
What's up?

4
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:24,614
What the hell is going on?

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,386
This, guys, is Tru.

6
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:33,091
My kind, caring...

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,864
and did I mention beautiful sister?

8
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,438
Nice to meet you guys. Explain.

9
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,104
You know how you and I
depend on each other?

10
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,642
- Harrison?
- The old saying:

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,110
<i>- "Mi casa es su casa"?</i>
- Harrison?

12
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,106
How about the Biblical quotation
that states:

13
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,548
"Let you without sin cast the first-- "

14
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,246
Harrison, just tell me what happened.

15
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:56,787
Our landlord.

16
00:00:56,856 --> 00:01:00,087
A real stickler for the whole
"paying the rent" thing.

17
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,085
You got evicted?

18
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,630
Which brings us back to <i>"mi casa."</i>

19
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,726
What's that water?

20
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:12,201
Yeah, you might not want to....
What is that?

21
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,509
Luc just fixed the sink this morning.
What did you do?

22
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,838
Nothing.

23
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:24,274
Guess you had to be there.

24
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,682
Why couldn't you have gone to Lindsay's?

25
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:30,353
Because telling your
new girlfriend you've just been evicted...

26
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,857
isn't very effective pillow talk.

27
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,657
Okay, we're out.

28
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,028
- Looks like you need your alone time.
- Thanks.

29
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,633
Let go, boys. I can take a hint.

30
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:45,731
Zachary.

31
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,379
By the way, there's some more beer
in the bathtub if you want to....

32
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,346
Yeah, right. Yeah.

33
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,420
- Open up the register.
- Excuse me?

34
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,148
You heard me. Open it up.

35
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,926
There's nothing. There's nothing here.

36
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,922
The cash went out an hour ago.

37
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,294
Then give me what you have. Now!

38
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,377
Help me.

39
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:27,597
You don't mind?

40
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,733
I am perfectly capable of prepping
a body solo.

41
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,743
Besides, you don't look so hot.

42
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,881
Stay away from the shrimp sandwich
at that new deli across the street.

43
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,939
Ouch.

44
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,610
You know, actually I'm....

45
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,289
If you'll excuse me....

46
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,302
Hey, there.

47
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,162
I'm Tru.

48
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,271
And you are...

49
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,651
...in the red.

50
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,718
How about a name?

51
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,322
Help me.

52
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,803
Bad dream?

53
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,371
Yeah. Bad dream.

54
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,943
What am I doing out here?

55
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,778
Well, the plan was you, me,
wine, and a movie.

56
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,185
The reality was you, wine,
passed out on the couch.

57
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,783
Anyway, sorry if I woke you.
I wanted to take care of this.

58
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:56,187
Luc just fixed the sink this morning.
What did you do?

59
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,123
You're fixing it.
Yeah.

60
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,665
Like you've been asking me to all week.

61
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,562
And she's off.

62
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,376
Yeah, I'm meeting Lindsay for breakfast.

63
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,412
On a weekday? Doesn't she work?

64
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,140
She's taking a sick day.

65
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,973
How do you know? You just woke up.

66
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,848
'Cause that's a girl thing.

67
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,051
- Aren't you gonna change first?
- These clothes are fine.

68
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,557
Besides, I'm running late.
Okay.

69
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,854
All right. Here's the thing.

70
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:32,963
I don't even mind your crazy excuses
about where you have to go all the time.

71
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:36,832
What I do mind is that you keep
a part of your life hidden from me.

72
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:41,071
No, it's nothing.
I'll make it up to you tonight.

73
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,969
Just bring coffee.

74
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,487
Hey, Tru.
<i>HeIIo?</i>

75
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,320
Hey, Harrison, it's me.
I've got some bad news.

76
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,553
<i>Give it to me.</i>
You'll be evicted today.

77
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,720
Tell me something I don't know.

78
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,524
<i>Meredith's in rehab.</i>
<i>Why don't you crash at her pIace?</i>

79
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,295
Or what about yours?
<i>Been there.</i>

80
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:13,304
- Hated that.
- A dreaded rewind day.

81
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,438
So, what did I do?

82
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:18,875
Poker with the boys, food on my couch,
flood in my kitchen.

83
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,810
<i>Tru, I am shocked.</i>

84
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,844
Shocked. I would never do anything....

85
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,009
Whoa, wait, was I winning?

86
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,245
Bye, Harr.

87
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,949
I'm kind of in a--
This will take a second.

88
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:34,015
I'm writing this song and I can't get
the last lyric. Check this out.

89
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:38,060
<i>I'm Iivin' out Ioud,</i>
<i>I'm drivin'right through</i>

90
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,065
<i>WiII you meet me there?</i>

91
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,928
<i>WiII you be true?</i>

92
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,703
Nice little pun there."Tru."

93
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,297
That's not what I meant.

94
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,706
That's not
quite what I'm looking for.

95
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,267
More of a....

96
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,411
All right.

97
00:06:56,482 --> 00:07:00,316
If the body asked for help, why didn't you
come to the morgue first and check?

98
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,718
Because he asked before I got
anything to go on.

99
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,314
No name, no personals.
I'm lucky I got the receipt.

100
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,795
And you are....

101
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,125
He should be here any minute.

102
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,396
<i>You got nothing eIse?</i>
<i>BuIIet wound to the chest.</i>

103
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,096
Wait, Davis, put the sandwich down.

104
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,874
- Why?
- Davis, it's a rewind day.

105
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,137
You want details,
or do you want to trust me?

106
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,337
Done.

107
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,546
Look, here he comes. I'll call you later.

108
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:44,996
...in the red.

109
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,006
ATM can really ruin your day, huh?

110
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,793
Can I just go on through? Thanks.

111
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:05,937
Can I help you?

112
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,880
Yes. There's a man
who went in before me.

113
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,472
Are you a relative?

114
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,108
No, but--

115
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:15,915
Nobody goes there unless they have
an appointment. Do you have one?

116
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,855
Didn't think so.
I have to ask you to take a seat.

117
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,893
And I have to ask you to bend the rules.

118
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,428
Otherwise you'll have
a situation on your hands.

119
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,088
I think I already do.

120
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,793
All right, yeah.

121
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,149
What's up, Harrison?

122
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,310
I went over to Meredith's, like you said.

123
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,853
<i>So you broke in?</i>

124
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,780
I didn't have a key.

125
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:54,451
And nobody told me she installed
this insane security system.

126
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,761
- So what's the password?
- What?

127
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,730
Wait! I'm coming!

128
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,098
Thanks a lot.

129
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,897
<i>Robbery, corner of CIark and Fourth.</i>

130
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,030
<i>Nearest unit respond immediateIy.</i>

131
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,707
<i>The password.</i>

132
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:13,505
<i>What is the stupid password?</i>

133
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,672
Sorry, I've got to call you back.

134
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,307
What?

135
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,390
Fellas. It is so good to see you.

136
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:05,358
Just give me the money.
There's nothing here.

137
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,194
- Now!
- Don't!

138
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,280
Oh, my God.
Sorry.

139
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,253
- Hey.
- I didn't mean to....

140
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:38,125
Can you hear me?
God, I'm sorry.

141
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,195
Talk to me. Hey.

142
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,500
Come on.
No. Please, no.

143
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,462
Stay with me.

144
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,031
No.

145
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,336
Is he....

146
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,516
Save me.

147
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,159
This can't be happening.
Bad dream?

148
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,305
More like a recurring nightmare.

149
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,978
Sorry if I woke you.
I wanted to take care of this.

150
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,611
Right. Thanks.

151
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:40,155
Sorry about crashing out last night.
I swear I'll make it up to you.

152
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,830
And she's off.
Where are you going this time?

153
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,967
The library.

154
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,630
- Doesn't open till 12:00.
- Right. I'm going to the university library.

155
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,338
For what?
For a work thing.

156
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,636
Are we playing 20 Questions?

157
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,441
No, just two.

158
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:06,449
Look, it's no fun for me either,
but I've really got to go.

159
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:11,684
And don't worry about the sink.
I don't think it's meant to be fixed.

160
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:14,419
- I can handle it.
- I didn't mean....

161
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,051
I know you can.

162
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,896
Thank you.

163
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:21,824
Bye.

164
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,164
Any time.

165
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,402
<i>No, Harr.</i> Mi casa es mi casa.

166
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,238
So you're asking me
to take up residence in a building...

167
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,040
where all my neighbors are dead?

168
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,405
Hang out at the morgue
until I figure something out.

169
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,973
<i>Wait, Iet me guess.</i>

170
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,279
Rewind day?

171
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,149
You could say that. Twice.

172
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,787
- So, what did I do?
- Trashed my place...

173
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,053
got busted breaking into
Meredith's apartment.

174
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,118
<i>Impressive.</i>
Just go to the morgue.

175
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,254
<i>Later.</i>

176
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,864
- Hey, Brian.
- I'm writing this song.

177
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,494
See if you can help me out.
Check this out.

178
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,628
<i>I'm Iivin' out Ioud,</i>
<i>I'm drivin'right through</i>

179
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,434
<i>WiII you meet me there?</i>

180
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,305
<i>Or are we through?</i>

181
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,312
You want me to rhyme"through"
with"through"?

182
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,008
That's creative.

183
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,651
How about....

184
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,389
- It rewound again?
- Yes.

185
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,421
Well, that's unexpected.

186
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,189
I thought I finally understood
how this thing works.

187
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:27,755
Someone asks for help, I save them,
happily ever after. But this time....

188
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,462
- Someone else died.
- Yeah. Because of me.

189
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,730
But because of you, someone lived.

190
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,933
Yeah, a guy committing a felony.

191
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,705
Explain to me how that's fair.
Can anybody just ask for help now?

192
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,714
Maybe there's a homicidal maniac
who needs some assistance?

193
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,147
Come on, Tru.

194
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:49,618
I've been through this twice,
and each time someone different died.

195
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:52,248
Which one am I supposed to save now?

196
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:54,786
Both.

197
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,395
Great. I know where one of them
is gonna be in eight minutes.

198
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,998
About the sandwich?

199
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,372
Right about...

200
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,669
now.

201
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:20,915
Aren't you....

202
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,919
Hey, I'm Lauren.
I work at the Rose Food Market.

203
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,157
Sorry, no.

204
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,123
In case you're planning on stopping by...

205
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,857
you should know we're closed
for inventory today.

206
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:39,596
Doors are locked, the registers are empty.

207
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:43,341
Listen, I don't know you,
or the Rose Food Market...

208
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,936
and I don't know why I care
if you're doing your inventory today.

209
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,637
Muscle tone appears slack.
Large, fatty liver.

210
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,641
Could be cirrhosis.

211
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:21,212
- I thought I had it bad.
- What are you doing here?

212
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,249
Following orders.
Tru told me to crash here.

213
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,542
Crash?
Yeah.

214
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,911
So where's my room?
Room?

215
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,516
We don't have rooms. We have drawers.

216
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,955
Whatever.

217
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,657
I'm easy.

218
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,696
I haven't seen you since my sister's party.

219
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,265
We never really got a chance to chat.

220
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:44,829
About?

221
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,465
Hello?

222
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,539
We're the only two people
who know what she can do.

223
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:53,510
Hey, you ever thought of convincing her
to play the ponies?

224
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:54,568
No.

225
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,116
I believe her gift provides her
with a higher calling. Do you mind?

226
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,951
These are sterile.

227
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,010
Well, they were sterile.

228
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,754
So, rewind day, huh?

229
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:12,258
Multiple rewind day.
Multiple?

230
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,329
Yeah, she told me.

231
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,630
First.

232
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,770
You gonna eat this?
No, it's good.

233
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,749
It's all yours.

234
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,314
Thanks.

235
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,214
Hey.

236
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:46,461
Can I help you?
Yeah. I don't feel very good.

237
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,194
I'm sorry. Do you have a doctor
or caseworker here?

238
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,066
No.
Okay, let me just get you set up.

239
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:55,004
Right now, I'm gonna be sick, ma'am.
To my stomach.

240
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,075
Down the hall, to your right.

241
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:11,220
You should be able to get it
more than anybody else.

242
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,748
You're telling me you can't
help me? Can you get me the medicine?

243
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:15,953
No--

244
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,859
Are you telling me you can't help me?

245
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:21,291
Will you give me the medicine?
I can't.

246
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:22,492
That's it?

247
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,395
- I don't have any more time.
- Mr. Mancuso, wait.

248
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,546
Hi, Patricia? Yeah, Stephanie Brandis.

249
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,049
Stephanie, it's nice to meet you.

250
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,813
Finally we got
another caseworker here. Come in.

251
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:44,515
If you're finished in the bathroom,
the doctor will see you now.

252
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:47,553
You know what? I'm feeling much better.

253
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,212
Hey, a little busy right now.

254
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,014
You must get your brother out of here.

255
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,715
Ten minutes ago, I found him
locked inside a crypt.

256
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,450
It's not a good time.

257
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,392
He's asking me how much
a corpse goes for on the black market.

258
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,362
Keep him occupied.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

259
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,092
Not soon enough.

260
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,669
Why don't you ask me for help?

261
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,477
<i>Come on. Hook a brother up.</i>

262
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,147
Hey, dude?
What the hell was in that sandwich?

263
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,712
Mr. Mancuso!

264
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,259
Mr. Mancuso?
Wait!

265
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,851
Wait, I'm coming! Thanks a lot.

266
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,760
Somebody's robbing that store.

267
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,458
<i>Robbery, corner of CIark and Fourth.</i>

268
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,524
<i>Nearest unit respond immediateIy.</i>

269
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:07,962
- Then give me what you have. Now!
- Freeze! Hands in the air!

270
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,268
Dear God.
Drop your weapon on the floor.

271
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,640
- I don't have any.
- It's in his left pocket.

272
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,613
- Empty it.
- This is all a big mistake.

273
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,400
My God! I didn't see him.

274
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:44,372
He came out of nowhere.
Somebody call an ambulance!

275
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,410
1180, Orange and First.
I need an EMS team immediately.

276
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,777
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>They're on their way.</i>

277
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,441
- Forget the ambulance.
- Is he....

278
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,816
Why didn't you listen to me?
I told you not to go in there.

279
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,057
Please.

280
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,592
Help me.

281
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,509
You've got to be kidding me.
What?

282
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:22,445
You've been trying to get me
to fix this sink for weeks.

283
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,649
Something tells me
it wants to stay broken.

284
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,885
Whoa, that's the fastest
I've ever seen you get ready.

285
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,448
That's the fastest I've ever seen
anybody get ready.

286
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:37,324
- Sorry, I've really got to run.
- Where?

287
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,825
Visiting Meredith.

288
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:43,095
- She wasn't allowed to have visitors.
- Only immediate family.

289
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:46,099
If it was something else,
you'd tell me, right?

290
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,403
Of course.

291
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,577
<i>Go crash at Lindsay's.</i>

292
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:57,342
'Cause telling your girlfriend you've been
evicted isn't very effective--

293
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,974
Pillow talk, my ass.

294
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,876
Nice language.
You having one of those days?

295
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,253
More like three of them.
Just be a polite guest, she'll understand.

296
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,390
Three? Sweet.

297
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,291
- Writing a song?
- How'd you know?

298
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:16,562
Because you're holding a guitar.
I'm sort of in a hurry.

299
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,796
Right. Okay. Check this out.

300
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:22,801
<i>I'm Iivin' out Ioud,</i>
<i>I'm drivin'right through</i>

301
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,808
<i>WiII you meet me there?</i>

302
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:27,071
<i>'Cause I'm stuck in traffic</i>

303
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:31,648
That doesn't rhyme.

304
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,181
Three times?

305
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:41,089
And each day, because of me,
someone different dies.

306
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,219
It's not your fault.
Besides, look at the bright side.

307
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,456
What's that?

308
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,465
Each day you're getting
a little bit more information.

309
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,932
Another clue.

310
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:53,300
Now you know the guy in the store
didn't have a gun.

311
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:57,064
So he's desperate. I get it. But so am I.

312
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,978
I mean, what if this day
never stops repeating?

313
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:04,708
If every day I wake up and make
the same lame excuse to Luc...

314
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:08,082
and call my brother in a vain attempt
to keep him out of trouble...

315
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:12,249
and then my neighbor with his lousy song?
I can't keep doing this.

316
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:16,151
Maybe your job isn't
as obvious as we thought.

317
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,294
What do you mean?

318
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,924
Perhaps someone
is supposed to die today...

319
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,930
and stay that way.

320
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,238
I can't deal with this.

321
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:41,411
I am not in the business of deciding
who is or isn't supposed to die.

322
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,683
- How do you know?
- Don't say that.

323
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:49,017
You know what everyone else my age
is deciding right now?

324
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,153
Grad school, or get a job?

325
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,591
Order in, or go out?

326
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:55,394
Do I really need a phone
that takes little pictures?

327
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:59,369
People say things happen for a reason.
That reason is fate.

328
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,202
Fate, by definition, is immutable.

329
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:05,504
- Maybe you're here to make sure that--
- Fate gets its way?

330
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,870
How do I know what it wants?

331
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,405
It'll tell you, eventually.

332
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:15,284
- And until then?
- You've got to trust your instincts.

333
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:26,629
- Back to the ATM?
- No.

334
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,495
Something went down in the clinic.

335
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,829
Whatever it was...

336
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:33,564
that's what made him desperate enough
to hold up the store.

337
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:13,402
Hi. I'm Stephanie Brandis,
one of your new caseworkers.

338
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,541
Hi, Patricia? Yeah, Stephanie Brandis.

339
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:21,318
Of course.
Through the door and to the left.

340
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:25,717
Patricia Norris is expecting you.
I thought she might be. Thanks.

341
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:31,224
Thank God. I've been asking
for a new caseworker for months.

342
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,320
Come on in.

343
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:35,366
I already started flipping
through some of the files.

344
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,333
I'm halfway through
the Mancuso case.

345
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:38,664
Awful, isn't it?

346
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:41,297
She is the sweetest child
you will ever meet.

347
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:42,896
She?
Elizabeth.

348
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,738
Her parents tried everything,
but with a case like this--

349
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,039
I haven't finished reading the file.

350
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,445
Elizabeth has acute viral cardiomyopathy.

351
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:53,882
- She had an echovirus last year.
- What's the course of treatment?

352
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,182
The doctor has her
on a daily antiarrhythmic.

353
00:25:56,254 --> 00:26:00,020
But the medicine's just a Band- Aid.
Ultimately, she'll need a heart transplant.

354
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,992
- Is she on the list?
- Yeah, pretty far down.

355
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,824
With O- neg patients like her...

356
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,296
the chances of a heart
becoming available are....

357
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,094
Slim to none.
Exactly.

358
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,658
Mr. Mancuso lost his job six months ago.

359
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:15,001
- His insurance is on its last leg, so--
- I need to talk to you.

360
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:18,075
Michael. We were just discussing
your daughter's case.

361
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,270
This is Stephanie Brandis,
a new caseworker.

362
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:22,005
Nice to meet you.

363
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,945
I need more Amiodarone.

364
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:27,280
We ran out, and Elizabeth's breathing
is very heavy today.

365
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:30,321
I went to the pharmacy,
but the insurance denied me.

366
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:35,917
You know, they were gonna charge me
$500 for two pills?

367
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:40,088
I don't have $500.
I'm aware--

368
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:43,623
I need you to get me that medicine.
I promise, I'll pay you back.

369
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,727
- Mr. Mancuso, calm down.
- She's in pain.

370
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:49,763
I'm not a pharmacist.
I'm not authorized to give away medicine.

371
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:53,275
I thought you were supposed to help me.

372
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:56,010
Give us some time.
We'll see what we can do.

373
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:59,050
- I don't have any.
- Mr. Mancuso....

374
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,348
Mr. Mancuso, wait.
I don't have any more time.

375
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,648
- I can't imagine it getting worse for him.
- I can.

376
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,521
Look, I swear to you,
I'm Stephanie Brandis...

377
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,425
and I have a meeting.

378
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:13,697
Don't make me call security.

379
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:15,594
Michael.

380
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:20,061
I understand your daughter is in trouble,
but Patricia can help you.

381
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:23,073
- Wait for her call.
- My daughter needs her medicine now.

382
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,701
She's not going to get it
if you do something stupid.

383
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,277
What are you talking about?

384
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:30,109
Don't tell me you're looking
for a quick way to get cash...

385
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:33,116
which might include holding up
the nearest store you find.

386
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,877
Leave me alone.

387
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:39,556
Don't do this.
You got any other options?

388
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,056
She's 11 years old.

389
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:49,794
The one thing my daughter needs
is the thing I can't give her.

390
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,002
I look at her friends and I wonder...

391
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,437
why their hearts work and hers doesn't.

392
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,438
Why she got sick and they didn't.

393
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,044
I can't fix her...

394
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,687
but I can make her feel better.

395
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,880
She needs her medicine.
She needs it now.

396
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,390
I'll get it for you.

397
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,518
Just give me an hour.

398
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:21,160
And no charge, but promise me
you won't go into that store.

399
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,209
An hour?
And your address.

400
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:42,651
820 South Normandy, Apartment 2.

401
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:46,251
Amiodarone, right?
Yeah, 15 milligrams.

402
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:49,919
Got it. Go sit with your daughter.
I'll be right there.

403
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:56,798
Thank you.

404
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,774
Wait! I'm coming!

405
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,710
Thank you.

406
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,717
Thank you so much.

407
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,250
<i>Robbery, corner of CIark and Fourth.</i>

408
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,558
<i>Nearest unit respond immediateIy.</i>

409
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,406
Go to the pharmacy on the corner
and ask for Timothy.

410
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,845
If she has shortness of breath,
this should work.

411
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:46,349
With acute viral cardiomyopathy,
she'll eventually--

412
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:48,442
I know. Need a transplant.

413
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,987
You sure he's gonna give me
$500 worth of medication?

414
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:55,753
He owes me. I set up his grandma
with a nice coffin last month.

415
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:58,418
It looks like you were wrong.

416
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,726
No one had to die today. Not one person.

417
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,790
I'm glad I was mistaken.

418
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:09,962
- What's up, Harry?
- I took your advice and went to Lindsay's.

419
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:13,108
<i>And you said to be a poIite houseguest.</i>

420
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:14,837
<i>WeII, I tried.</i>

421
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:19,443
But I thought I'd be nice
and cook a little something for dinner...

422
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,551
and I might have started a small fire.

423
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,417
And you're calling me why?

424
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,957
On the off chance
the day boomerangs again...

425
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:30,290
I need you to say two simple
words: takeout.

426
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,485
Good luck, Harry.

427
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,693
You okay?
Kind of not. No.

428
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:41,434
- Word of advice. Stay away from that--
- Shrimp sandwich.

429
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:46,034
Yeah, my bad. I forgot to warn you.
I've been kind of busy. Sorry.

430
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,370
It's okay. Priorities. Go.

431
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,535
Michael, I have the medicine.

432
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:28,817
Is she....

433
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,022
She's gone.

434
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,996
I should've been here sooner.

435
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:49,000
The medicine wouldn't have saved her life.

436
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:53,741
Thank you for trying.

437
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,477
I'm so sorry.

438
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,417
There's a plan for everyone.

439
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,495
Oh, come here.

440
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:24,134
<i>She's in a better pIace.</i>

441
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:31,303
We did everything we could.
You know we did everything.

442
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:41,719
Please.

443
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:50,026
Help me.

444
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,003
Bad dream?
I wish.

445
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,380
You don't need to bother fixing that.
Trust me.

446
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,221
- Are you okay?
- No.

447
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,386
Can I help?
No.

448
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:20,394
And she's off.

449
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,995
Out of curiosity,
where are you rushing off to?

450
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:27,094
I could make up some excuse
that you'd see right through...

451
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,503
because you know me, and I love that.

452
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:32,474
But for us to work,
you need to know everything.

453
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:35,774
For that to happen,
you need to wait a little bit longer.

454
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,213
Obviously, we have a lot to talk about.

455
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:41,683
But I see you're stressed about something,
so let me help with that.

456
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:46,014
You're right. Maybe you could help me
with something.

457
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,490
Harrison's having
a really bad couple of days.

458
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,995
And he might come by here.
Can you keep him out of trouble?

459
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,156
- Okay.
- Thank you.

460
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,065
- I'll talk to you tonight.
- Yeah.

461
00:33:58,569 --> 00:33:59,661
We'll see.

462
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,107
Tru.

463
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,237
<i>I'm Iivin' out Ioud,</i>
<i>I'm drivin'right through</i>

464
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:11,008
<i>WiII you meet me there?</i>
<i>So we can start anew</i>

465
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:16,581
That's my song.

466
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:19,145
I think we're on the same
kind of wavelength here.

467
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,850
You want to start a band?

468
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,227
You must be so sick
of explaining this to me.

469
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,763
Each time the day repeats, it gets worse.

470
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,628
You should've seen this family.

471
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,395
Let me get this straight again.
You saved the father.

472
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,802
Yeah. So he could watch his daughter die.
How is that okay?

473
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:37,033
- Without you, they both would've--
- I know.

474
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:40,167
But I'm still stuck in the same day.
What am I doing wrong?

475
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,872
Maybe you're doing everything
exactly right.

476
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,813
Davis, you can theorize all you want.

477
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,750
Maybe everything
was meant to lead you...

478
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,378
directly to this little girl.

479
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:53,219
So I'm supposed to keep Michael
away from the store...

480
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,986
and get help for his daughter?

481
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:58,495
And don't forget, the help that
he thinks she needs is useless.

482
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,963
The medicine isn't gonna save her life.

483
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,330
I have to get her to the hospital.

484
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:09,033
Davis, the sandwich in the fridge,
hand it over.

485
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,840
- What?
- Now.

486
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:19,910
What am I supposed to eat?

487
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,857
Michael.

488
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:31,623
- Who are you?
- You don't know me.

489
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:34,722
There's no time to explain,
but I'm here to help your daughter.

490
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:38,895
- She has to get to a hospital now.
- She's gonna be fine.

491
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,798
She's not. Elizabeth's in trouble.

492
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,806
- Believe me.
- How do you know her name?

493
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:47,401
Same way I know you're about to find out
that your balance is - $432.18.

494
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,919
- I don't understand.
- You'll go to the clinic...

495
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,389
to beg for free medicine for Elizabeth,
but let me save you some time.

496
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:03,256
Patricia Norris, your caseworker,
will be sympathetic...

497
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,057
but she's not authorized
to give you the meds.

498
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:08,622
What are you talking about?

499
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,327
Amiodarone isn't gonna save her life.

500
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,561
Her heart is gonna fail today.

501
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,837
Is there anything you wouldn't do
for your daughter?

502
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,347
I'd die for her.

503
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:30,281
Call your wife, and tell her
to get Elizabeth to the hospital.

504
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,648
Here.

505
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,186
Honey, it's me. Is she....

506
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:43,966
No, the medicine is not gonna help her.

507
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,030
Take her to the hospital.

508
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:49,797
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

509
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,578
Thank you...

510
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,042
whoever you are.

511
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:07,216
I want all your money right now.
I don't have a thing.

512
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,851
<i>Robbery, corner of CIark and Fourth.</i>

00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:14,028
Come on!
Please. He doesn't have anything.

515
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:15,725
- Shut up.
- Please.

516
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,826
Take my necklace. It's worth a lot.
Just don't hurt him.

517
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:22,339
Please, take this.
All right.

518
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:25,507
All right, take it off. Come on.

519
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:28,011
- Come on.
- I'm trying.

520
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:32,880
No!

521
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,714
No!

522
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,985
Move it! The necklace, come on. Let's go.

523
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,493
Hey, it's okay.

524
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,990
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

525
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,361
Multiple stab wounds.

526
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,459
He's bleeding out. We need another line.

527
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:55,164
Get a 14- gauge
and set up the rapid infuser.

528
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:58,538
Send a type and cross match
to the blood bank now. On three.

529
00:37:58,643 --> 00:37:59,871
One, two, three.

530
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:05,380
- Who the hell are you?
- City morgue.

531
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,845
Where's my daughter?

532
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:12,452
Damn it. She's in v- fib.
Elizabeth?

533
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,052
Elizabeth?

534
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,491
Get the paddles.
No.

535
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,721
Everybody clear?
Elizabeth.

536
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,656
Still no pulse. Start the compressions.

537
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,867
Please, no.

538
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,037
Oh, God, no.

539
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:29,732
Please try and calm down.

540
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,900
<i>Three entry wounds in</i>
<i>the right upper quadrant, set up for a DPO.</i>

541
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,104
Yes, doctor.
Blood in the peritoneum.

542
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:38,306
Where the hell is the trauma surgeon?

543
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:42,383
I'd die for her.

544
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,392
I'm not gonna make it.

545
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,221
Doctor?
Please.

546
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:57,761
Make sure she's okay, please.

547
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,201
Pressure's still dropping.
Clear.

548
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,637
Push more ringers, fast.

549
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,210
He needs blood.
Where is the O- neg I ordered?

550
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,905
On its way.
Scalpel.

551
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:10,874
With O- neg patients like Elizabeth...

552
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:13,212
the chances of a heart
becoming available are....

553
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:14,308
Slim to none.

554
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,416
You're a mess.

555
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,950
His heart was destroyed.

556
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,486
<i>But not today.</i>

557
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:30,131
I didn't need to save him,
I needed to save his heart.

558
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,463
For her.

559
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:39,604
Your daughter's gonna live a long
and healthy life.

560
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,977
Come on. Push through.

561
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:52,851
Damn it.

562
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,331
Time of death, 12:32 p. m.

563
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,967
His daughter needs his heart.

564
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:14,508
Notify the transplant team,
and get Pediatric Cardiology.

565
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,170
I hope
you didn't just break that.

566
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:27,250
Because Luc spent two hours
trying to fix it.

567
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,952
Yeah. I know.

568
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,849
Hey, you okay?

569
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:37,322
This has been the longest day of my life.

570
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:38,918
I know the feeling.

571
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:42,397
If it makes you feel any better,
I got evicted today.

572
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,589
Really?

573
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,431
But your boy Luc really saved my ass.

574
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,763
He kept your buddies
from trashing my place?

575
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:54,301
Yeah, that, and he joined
the poker game and then he....

576
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,274
Let's just say that I have
enough money for last month's rent.

577
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,883
Oh, and next month's, too.

578
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,485
But you should get some rest.

579
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,824
- I'm out. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

580
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:13,996
I really hope so.

581
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,163
Hey.

582
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,664
Hi.

583
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:03,074
So you were right.
Someone was supposed to die.

584
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:08,482
He just had to die differently
so someone else could live.

585
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:13,085
I should've been able to save them both.

586
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:21,291
You can change events,
but you can't change fate, Tru.

587
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,794
I can do things that
probably no one else can.

588
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:29,529
Sometimes even that
doesn't feel like enough.

589
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,072
Sometimes it isn't.
