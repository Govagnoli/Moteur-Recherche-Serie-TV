1
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:07,768
- You're happy.
- Why shouldn't I be?

2
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:12,368
I'm 22 years old, I'm healthy.
I have a nice guy that I work with.

3
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,275
- Who, me?
- Yes. You, Davis.

4
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:16,815
I have good friends.

5
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:19,681
A cute boy,
who I can almost call my boyfriend.

6
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:23,712
And, every week or so,
I get a shout- out from a corpse and....

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,451
You relive the day.

8
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,017
It comes in handy, you know?
Bad day? Do it over.

9
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,694
Bad outfit, quick wardrobe change.

10
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,097
- Premature death?
- Prevent it from happening.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,327
Well, Wonder Woman has nothing on you.

12
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:39,599
Except for the pointy bras
and the invisible plane, no.

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,408
It's nice to see you making peace with it.

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,105
Let's be honest.
It's not like I really have a choice.

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,445
I don't think those people
will take no for an answer.

16
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:54,351
Just out of curiosity, who else
have you told about what you can do?

17
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,151
Just my brother. Not that he believes me.

18
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,021
Except when he thinks
he can make a buck on the ponies.

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,687
- Anyone else?
- No.

20
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:05,625
Not my sister, or Lindsay.
And definitely not Luc.

21
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,996
It's hard enough to date
without dropping that bomb.

22
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,001
What about your father?

23
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:14,238
It's kind of hard to tell someone
who doesn't want to talk to you.

24
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,673
And it's funny. I can prevent death...

25
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,473
but I can't make a father
take interest in his own daughter.

26
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:20,638
- Tru--
- I know.

27
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:22,408
Too much information.
No.

28
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:26,179
I just want you to remember
that a gift like yours is never simple.

29
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,583
But there's someone...

30
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,214
who's gonna be very grateful
for what you can do.

31
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,917
Maybe even today.

32
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:39,924
Jake.

33
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,328
We just got your CAT scan back.

34
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:46,562
And?

35
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,641
Why don't we talk for a moment?

36
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:01,642
Jake.

37
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:05,721
What are you doing out of bed?
And why are you wearing your uniform?

38
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:09,193
You know you're supposed
to be in your robe. Jake?

39
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:12,820
Jake.

40
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:26,835
No go. You know the rules.
I need to get out of here.

41
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,038
Jake, I'm sorry.
You know the doc said to take it easy.

42
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:34,652
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
I just gotta do something. One thing.

43
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:35,710
Come on, back inside.

44
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,052
You're not supposed to
be out here anyway.

45
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:41,560
Jake, you okay? You all right?
I'm just....

46
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:46,257
- What are you doing? Don't be stupid.
- I told you, I gotta get out of here.

47
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,824
Jake, come on, listen to me.

48
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,536
I just talked to the doc and....

49
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,668
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
You won't even miss me.

50
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,342
What the hell was that?

51
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,638
He had a gun. I saw he had a gun.

52
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:06,617
It was Jake, for God's sake. It's just Jake.

53
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,486
He's dead.

54
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,765
<i>Hey, it's Tru. </i>
<i>Leave a message. </i>

55
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,528
<i>HeIIo, Tru, it's your father. </i>

56
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,266
<i>I know it's been a whiIe...</i>

57
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,571
<i>but I'd Iike to taIk to you</i>
<i>when you get a chance. </i>

58
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,168
<i>You know where to reach me. Goodbye. </i>

59
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,945
Dad called you, too?

60
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,451
- Yeah, why? You?
- Yeah. And Harrison, also.

61
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:15,947
He's sweet like that.

62
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,149
Every five years,
no matter how busy he is...

63
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,782
he drops everything and he calls.

64
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,156
What'd he say?

65
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,422
It was a short,
unpleasant conversation.

66
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,623
He asked if I had a job yet.

67
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,990
He asked if I had a husband yet.

68
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,763
Just like the old guy. Charming as ever.

69
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,504
So what did he ask you?

70
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,964
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

71
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:41,302
I didn't call him back yet.
I will, just a little later, though.

72
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:45,073
You believe that SOB?
Doesn't talk to us in ages.

73
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:48,314
And when he does,
all he wants to do is criticize.

74
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,322
I wonder what he would've said to me.

75
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,951
"You work in a morgue?"
And"You're not a doctor yet?"

76
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,395
- Sounds about right.
- Look at the bright side.

77
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,330
- At least you've got a job.
- Yeah. And a guy.

78
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,097
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

79
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,640
How's Grandma? How's Rochester?

80
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,906
One is feeling better,
the other is way too far away from you.

81
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,003
Good news.

82
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,811
Davis is letting me take an early shift
so we can finally have our night alone.

83
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,681
- That's great.
- But?

84
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:22,186
But there's a small problem.
Train derailment.

85
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,281
<i>They shut down aII routes</i>
<i>up and down the entire seaboard. </i>

86
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,451
- Wonderful.
- But don't worry.

87
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,619
<i>I'II figure it out. </i>

88
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,528
It's gonna take more
than a train derailment to keep us apart.

89
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,214
Well, what the hell.

90
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,946
You don't have a résumé?
Let's be honest.

91
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,858
What is a"résumé" anyway?
A list of jobs that didn't work out.

92
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,123
No, seriously, I believe in starting fresh.

93
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,259
I'm always looking forward. Never back.

94
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:15,564
And tell me, what are
some of the unique qualities...

95
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,175
that you could bring to this job?

96
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,504
Laughs. A lot of laughs, Marjorie.

97
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,582
You mind if I call you Marjorie?

98
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,898
Not quite as creepy as I thought it'd be.

99
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,991
Meredith, what a surprise.

100
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,193
I figured we're actually
getting along today...

101
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:45,998
why not push our luck.

102
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:50,041
I also thought you'd like to know
our brother went on a job interview today.

103
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,633
Dad really got to him, huh?

104
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:55,339
Yeah, well, not enough to keep him
from totally tanking the interview.

105
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,542
Why, what happened?
Same old thing.

106
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,585
Wore the wrong thing,
said the wrong thing...

107
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,677
didn't even bring a résumé.

108
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,818
Face it,
Harry's not exactly the nine- to- five type.

109
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,086
That's what you came here to tell me?

110
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:12,192
No, actually.
I came to find out what Dad said to you.

111
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,399
Don't know. I haven't called back.

112
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,204
- But you will, right?
- Why should I?

113
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,604
So he can pass judgment on me, too?

114
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,108
<i>I mean, Iook how he made you feeI, </i>
<i>and Harrison. </i>

115
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:27,010
Look, Dad's off in Connecticut
with a new wife, a new life...

116
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,173
and every five years he calls his kids
and we're supposed to jump?

117
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,739
He's still our father, Tru.

118
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,685
Yeah. Our father, who art in Greenwich.

119
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,623
Who's that?

120
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,751
Davis, my boss.

121
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,889
Cute.

122
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,530
In that he's- so- not- my- type kind of way.

123
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,572
Wait a second,
I know what Dad said to you...

124
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,608
but tell me
you're not thinking what I think--

125
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,201
- He's a doctor, am I right?
- Yeah, but--

126
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:01,872
Thought I'd let you know
I'll take my lunch break now.

127
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,745
I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company.

128
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,341
- Hi, I'm Tru's sister, Meredith.
- Hi.

129
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,754
Tru didn't tell me
she had a younger sister.

130
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:13,021
Actually, I'm her older sister.

131
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:16,489
I'm shocked.
Your epidermal layer is flawless.

132
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,062
You know, I haven't eaten all day.

133
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:23,101
I mean, if you wouldn't mind
some company....

134
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,230
Really?

135
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,109
So the gentleman's aorta...

136
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,372
was literally wrapped around
his left ventricle...

137
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,573
and I'd never seen anything like it.

138
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,778
<i>And not to mention</i>
<i>that his inferior vena cava...</i>

139
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,581
which, an interesting thing about that--

140
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:45,715
Is there anything else that
we could talk about besides autopsies?

141
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,627
- Sure.
- Great.

142
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,957
So, you a <i>Lord of the Rings</i> fan?

143
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,558
No, sorry.

144
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,095
Would you like me to
finish the autopsy story...

145
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,197
'cause it contains
a lot of interesting things.

146
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,775
No, thank you.

147
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,205
Look at that.

148
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,374
lsn't that the bailiff
from Judge Stern's court?

149
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,146
I'll be right back.

150
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,782
Jim. What a surprise.
So nice to see you.

151
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,757
<i>I didn't recognize you</i>
<i>without your uniform. </i>

152
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,594
She walked out on you?
Not literally.

153
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,058
Okay, literally.
She spotted some bailiff she knew.

154
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,797
The next thing I know,
she's riding off on his motorcycle.

155
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:37,069
Davis, I'm so sorry.
She's a little unpredictable sometimes.

156
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:40,977
Not to mention, my father
has us all acting a little crazy today.

157
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,608
It's not the first time it's happened.
Just the quickest.

158
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:52,146
I should've known a girl like that
wouldn't be interested in a guy like me.

159
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,190
Morgue.

160
00:09:58,798 --> 00:09:59,822
You're where?

161
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:03,093
About 80 miles west
of where I'm supposed to be.

162
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:06,338
- What happened?
- The rental agency gave me directions.

163
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,203
- Bad ones?
- Not if I wanted to go to Cleveland.

164
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,310
I know we were both looking forward
to tonight...

165
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,814
but it doesn't look like
I'm getting home before dawn.

166
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:21,148
- That'll teach us to make a plan.
- We'll have our night soon. Promise.

167
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,283
lncoming.

168
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:24,548
Okay, I gotta go.

169
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,751
Drive safe, okay?
<i>Bye. </i>

170
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:35,199
Cpl. Jake Voight, 21, just
got home from a tour of the Middle East.

171
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,702
- What happened?
- A disturbance at the Army Hospital.

172
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,672
One of the MPs had an itchy trigger finger.

173
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:46,604
- Time of death?
- 10:00 a. m. on the dot.

174
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,705
Slight jurisdiction problem,
otherwise we would've had him sooner.

175
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:53,081
It looks like a clean shot.
Probably died instantly.

176
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,888
He survived the war.
Couldn't survive coming home, huh?

177
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,948
Shipped out from Fort McAllister
18 months ago.

178
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,756
He was wounded in battle.
Took a bullet in the thigh.

179
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,763
<i>CIean biII of heaIth</i>
<i>and they sent him home. </i>

180
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:09,364
The doc said he was a hero,
saved his entire squad in Afghanistan.

181
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,095
You know anything else about him?

182
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:14,798
You writing his biography?
Maybe rewriting it.

183
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,444
The Army notify his family?
No one to notify.

184
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,482
The Army said
there is no next of kin.

185
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,211
It's a shame.
No one should have to die alone.

186
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,219
Do me a favor.
Take him to Number 2...

187
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,380
I'll do an autopsy tonight.

188
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,351
I need you.

189
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,792
<i>Hey, it's Tru. </i>
<i>Leave a message. </i>

190
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,661
<i>HeIIo, Tru, it's your father. </i>

191
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,927
<i>I know it's been a whiIe...</i>

192
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:18,197
<i>but I'd Iike to taIk to you</i>
<i>when you get a chance. </i>

193
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,337
I can't make it to breakfast today.

194
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,347
How about one of these days,
let me know the night before...

195
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,077
- so I don't have to wake up so early?
- Sorry.

196
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,312
I never know when these things
are gonna come up.

197
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,852
By the way,
I got an interesting call this morning.

198
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,153
Me, too.
<i>You know what he said to me? </i>

199
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,024
Wondered when I was gonna get a job.

200
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,892
Look, here's the thing, Harry.

201
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,330
None of us will ever be
good enough for him.

202
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,890
- Nothing we do will ever--
- You don't think I know that?

203
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,368
I stopped trying to impress the guy
when I turned 14.

204
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,803
- Harry?
- Yeah?

205
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,808
I just wanted to say
employers like résumés.

206
00:12:56,876 --> 00:13:00,073
They like applicants who dress nice
and who know their business.

207
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:03,673
- Tru, what's this about?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

208
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,114
<i>Just one more thing. </i>

209
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:08,813
Make sure Meredith doesn't stop by
the morgue today, okay?

210
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,418
- Okay. Whatever.
- Hi.

211
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,850
- Who was that?
- Tru. She can't make breakfast.

212
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,561
No surprise there.

213
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,962
And she said not to stop
by the morgue later.

214
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,829
Stop by the morgue?

215
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,028
Why would she think
I'd ever stop by the morgue?

216
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,433
I don't know.

217
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,006
Why would she ever think
I'd need a résumé?

218
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,544
No, I'm serious.
Train derailment?

219
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:36,513
You haven't heard?
Because it's all over the news down here.

220
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:37,913
It's a good thing you told me.

221
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,848
I'd hate to get stuck in Rochester all day.

222
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,079
Why don't you take the bus?

223
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,815
I know for a fact there's one
that leaves in half an hour.

224
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:47,384
That's impressive. Weird, but impressive.

225
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:48,753
But I'm not much for buses.

226
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,126
I think I'll just spring for
the rental car instead.

227
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,461
- No.
- Don't you want to see me tonight?

228
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:54,897
No, of course I do.

229
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,902
It's just I want to make sure
you have the proper directions.

230
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,564
Why do I have a feeling
you're gonna tell me what they are?

231
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,907
Hi, Jake Voight?

232
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,883
- Down the hall, Room 248.
- Thanks.

233
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:30,994
I need you.

234
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,140
Hi, I'm here to see a patient.

235
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,710
I'm sorry, visiting hours
don't start until noon.

236
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:39,744
Noon?

237
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,211
- Time of death?
- 10:00 a. m. on the dot.

238
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,015
I can't wait until noon.
In fact, I can't wait much longer at all.

239
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,245
I can't wait until noon.
In fact, I can't wait much longer at all.

240
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,451
Jake's an old friend of mine from basic.
I heard he was here.

241
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,082
I'm sorry, miss.
He'll still be here in two hours.

242
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:56,821
- Please, you don't understand.
- I understand fine. We'll see you at noon.

243
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,565
Jake.

244
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,407
We just got your CAT scan back.

245
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:13,769
And?

246
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,114
Why don't we talk for a moment?

247
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,511
Jake.

248
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,387
What are you doing out of bed?
And why are you wearing your uniform?

249
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,657
You know you're supposed
to be in your robe. Jake?

250
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,230
Excuse me, Nurse?

251
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,166
- Yes?
- The patient wants a second opinion.

252
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:20,609
I've got a healthy male with a swollen leg.
lbuprofen and bed rest?

253
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,613
No go. You know the rules.

254
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:26,583
I've done that for four days.
I think I should see the doctor.

255
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,643
- Smoker?
- Once in a while.

256
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,684
He could have DVT.
You might wanna do an ultrasound.

257
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:32,781
That's just me.

258
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,250
I need to get out of here.

259
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,060
I'm sorry, Jake.

260
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,121
Maybe you should stick around
a little longer.

261
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,397
What are you doing? Don't be stupid.

262
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,460
No.
I told you, I gotta get out.

263
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,266
I just talked to the doc and--

264
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,841
Jake, put down the gun, please.

265
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,674
Listen to her, Jake.

266
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:55,475
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
Okay? You won't even miss me.

267
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:56,878
No, don't.

268
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,848
Jake, let her go.

269
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,079
I told you, I just gotta get out of here.

270
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,552
Don't move.

271
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,650
Just take it easy.

272
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,056
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

273
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,465
Listen, tell them
I'll be back as soon as I can.

274
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,868
Wait, where are you going, Jake?

275
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,377
You okay, Nurse?
Yeah, I'm fine.

276
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,772
Stop!

277
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:31,947
So is Jake.

278
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:35,280
- I'm not sure I'd say that.
- Why?

279
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:39,855
Because if we don't find him soon,
next time you see him, he'll be dead.

280
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,626
Jake was wounded overseas.

281
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:55,162
The doctors removed the bullet and
sent him back to the States to recuperate.

282
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,334
Two weeks ago,
we learned that a bullet fragment...

283
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,935
had become dislodged
and settled in his pulmonary artery.

284
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,742
So you removed the fragment?

285
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,648
We tried, but he began hemorrhaging
during surgery.

286
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,378
When do you try again?

287
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,149
Well, until this morning we had no plans.

288
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,315
What happened this morning?

289
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,892
A CAT scan revealed
that an embolism had formed.

290
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,156
<i>We have no other choice</i>
<i>but to open him up again. </i>

291
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,221
'Cause if the embolism
ruptures the artery....

292
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,164
He'll die immediately.

293
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:26,428
That kid has a time bomb ticking
inside of him.

294
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:30,602
So let's just hope that
the MPs find him before it goes off.

295
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:34,575
I don't get it.

296
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,979
I save a guy only to learn
he could be dead by the end of the day.

297
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,712
Once the symptoms set in,
shortness of breath, sweating...

298
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,946
it's only a matter of hours.

299
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,284
Even if I find him
before the embolism kills him...

300
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,085
there's no guarantee he'll survive.

301
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,420
Okay, let's just think.

302
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,553
You told me that Jake said
he had something to do.

303
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,859
Yeah. That's what I heard him
tell the MP.

304
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:56,628
If you knew that you were gonna die
in a matter of hours, what would you do?

305
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,728
I don't know. Cry. Get drunk.

306
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,699
Say goodbye.

307
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:06,335
According to his enlistment papers,
Jake has no family, no next of kin.

308
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:12,108
There was a photo in his wallet.
A picture of a girl.

309
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:15,551
Her name is Bridget Elkins.
She couldn't be older than 19.

310
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,982
There's no Bridget.

311
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,083
There is a George Elkins
at 567 Charleston Road.

312
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,527
- It could be her father.
- I'll take it. Thanks.

313
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,894
By the way, you just missed your sister.

314
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,762
- She came here?
- Yeah.

315
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:33,367
You guys didn't happen to make plans
by any chance?

316
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,676
I can take it. How bad did it go?

317
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:43,481
She dumped you
for a bailiff on a motorcycle.

318
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:48,379
Davis, look, she's my sister
and I love her, but she's complicated.

319
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:53,189
I should've known a girl like Meredith
would never go for a guy like me.

320
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,159
- You really liked her, huh?
- Yeah.

321
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,860
I may regret this, but take notes...

322
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,900
'cause I'll tell you everything
you need to know about my sister.

323
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,425
London, yes.

324
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,062
But to be honest,
the city that I really love is Dublin.

325
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:12,269
I lived there my junior year.
That's amazing. That's so cool.

326
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,776
The next thing you know...

327
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,336
you'll tell me you're thinking about
moving back there.

328
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,440
Now this is getting weird.

329
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,186
Someone you know?
No one important.

330
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:29,455
Of course, I would be remiss
if I didn't mention my love for animals.

331
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:33,794
I love all kinds.
Dogs, cats. I adore horses.

332
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:36,961
I see.

333
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:41,999
So Tru did a pretty good job, huh?
Telling you exactly what to say?

334
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,608
Let me tell you something
Tru doesn't know about me.

335
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,271
I don't want a guy to be
just like me.

336
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:52,078
I want a guy to be himself.
That's what really impresses me.

337
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:53,844
- Be myself?
- Yeah.

338
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,612
- Okay, I can do that.
- Good.

339
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:57,848
So....

340
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,050
You a <i>Lord of the Rings</i> fan?

341
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,861
567 Charleston.

342
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,719
Jake.

343
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,085
You okay?

344
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,456
She's gone. They left.

345
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,796
You're that nurse from the hospital.

346
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,667
It's okay, I'm alone.

347
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:52,276
You have to go back.
Without that surgery, you'll die.

348
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:55,780
And with it, I hear my chances
aren't that much better.

349
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,575
Anyway, I'm not going back until I find her.

350
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,116
Bridget?

351
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,420
I was 18.

352
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:10,421
I was stationed at McAllister.

353
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,195
She was finishing her senior year
in high school.

354
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,290
You were in love with her.

355
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,903
Yeah. Crazy love.

356
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,305
I saw her...

357
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,668
and I just knew.

358
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,910
Luckily, she felt the same way.

359
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,708
That's what I thought.

360
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,875
What happened?

361
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,318
I don't know. That's just it.

362
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,683
I had a 48- hour pass
before I was shipped out.

363
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:46,289
The greatest two days of my life.

364
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,695
Just me and Bridget.

365
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:54,170
Then I deploy, and a telegram shows up.

366
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:57,140
She said she never wanted
to see me again...

367
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,344
that we were over. Done.

368
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,643
I called, but her number was changed.

369
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,647
I wrote, but the letters came back to me.

370
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,283
And if you don't mind me asking,
what makes you want to see her now?

371
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,416
As much as I'd like to...

372
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,859
there are a lot of things I can't forget.

373
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,896
About war...

374
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,667
about seeing your best buddies shot down
in the desert...

375
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:29,070
8, 000 miles from home.

376
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:34,208
But the one thing I can't remember...

377
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,747
is the one thing I swore I'd never forget.

378
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,347
Her face.

379
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,025
All I have left is this.

380
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,253
I could die...

381
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,759
on the table, or right now.

382
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,304
- And if I do....
- You don't know that.

383
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:02,973
And if I do...

384
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,142
I don't want to close my eyes...

385
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,078
and not be able to see her face.

386
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,983
Of course, now she's gone.

387
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,729
Can't find her anywhere.

388
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:28,559
There are a lot of ways
to find someone, Jake.

389
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,622
Really?

390
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:33,762
If I help you, you promise me
you'll go back and get that surgery?

391
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,199
Sure.

392
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:43,647
Still, I don't know how I'm gonna find her.

393
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:46,046
The house is empty. They moved.

394
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:51,020
Look inside, all that's left
are light bulbs and old magazines.

395
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,313
Old magazines?

396
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,319
Hi, this is Bridget Elkins.

397
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:59,958
How am I? To tell you the truth,
not too good.

398
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,024
I've called three times this month...

399
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,400
and I still can't get you people
to send your magazine to my new address.

400
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,563
Yeah.

401
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,735
Just so it doesn't happen again,
could you do me a favor...

402
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,403
and confirm that you have
the correct forwarding address?

403
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:19,147
Yes? 4963 Denson.

404
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,811
That's it. Thanks very much.

405
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:31,289
You have no idea how many applicants
show up without a résumé.

406
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,796
- No.
- Yes.

407
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:36,267
I mean, just having one
puts you at the top of my list.

408
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:40,134
Of course, I don't notice
any prior experience in real estate.

409
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,399
That's because I don't have any.

410
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:46,534
But look, I've been selling something
to someone since I was 16...

411
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,704
and what I found is that
as long as you listen to the customer...

412
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,782
you can be successful
no matter what your product is.

413
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,377
All right then,
what are some of the unique qualities...

414
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:58,581
that you could bring to this job?

415
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:01,023
Laughs. A lot of laughs, Marjorie.

416
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:05,460
But, seriously. Passion, sincerity...

417
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,923
and a little thing I like to call"persistence."

418
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,161
Unique? Maybe not.

419
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:15,473
But what this company needs? Absolutely.

420
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,377
Here we are.

421
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:26,617
Looks like Mr. Elkins
has been doing okay for himself.

422
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,647
- How do I look?
- Great.

423
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,348
Well.

424
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:37,088
- Not bad for a dead man anyway.
- Come on, stop that.

425
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,654
Hey.

426
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:40,993
You're sweating.

427
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:43,660
Once the symptoms set in,
shortness of breath, sweating...

428
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,066
it's only a matter of hours.

429
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,466
You stay here, I'll get her.

430
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:52,839
You promise, as soon as you see her,
it's right back to the hospital.

431
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:56,039
Yeah. Just one thing.

432
00:26:57,515 --> 00:27:00,882
If her father answers the door,
don't mention my name.

433
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:04,287
- Why not?
- Bridget's a smart girl.

434
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,347
He's got big plans for her.

435
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:09,689
Falling in love with a soldier was not one.

436
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,152
Probably can't blame him.

437
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:15,265
I mean, does your dad like the guys
you bring home?

438
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,994
He never met them.

439
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:20,260
I'm sorry. He's dead?

440
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,796
Just by choice.

441
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,589
- Hello.
- Hi. Is Bridget home?

442
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:46,119
- No, she's out right now.
- Could you tell me where I might find her?

443
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:49,724
- I'm sorry, you are?
- A friend of hers from high school.

444
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,761
You must not recognize me. Tru Davies.

445
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,133
No, I can't say that I....

446
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,730
New nose. And I lost, like, 20 pounds, too.

447
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,934
Don't be embarrassed.
You wouldn't be the first.

448
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:02,275
Tru. Yes, of course.
Why don't you come in for a moment?

449
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,713
Now, what's so urgent?

450
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,045
I'm only in town for a few hours.

451
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,988
In fact, I'm on my way to the airport
and if I didn't see her--

452
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,117
She's at school.
She's got class all afternoon.

453
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,184
I'll tell her you stopped by, if you'd like.

454
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:20,390
Or I could swing by campus,
if you point me in the right direction.

455
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:23,332
Look, she'll back from the JC
in a few hours.

456
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,835
Junior College,
but Bridget was a valedictorian.

457
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,905
She could've written her own ticket.

458
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:43,280
Come on, Jake. We're going back
to the hospital right now.

459
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:44,343
Jake?

460
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,286
Who are you?

461
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,349
Did you bring Jake here?
Is that why you came?

462
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,895
Yes, but you don't understand.
He needs to see Bridget.

463
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,955
You leave my house.
And you stay away from my daughter.

464
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,057
I said let go.

465
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:58,568
You have to go with them.
I came to see Bridget.

466
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,297
- I didn't see her.
- I know where she is.

467
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,873
I promise you, Jake, I'll find her.
Just please go.

468
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,239
Oh, my God. Hurry.

469
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,177
- Get him back now.
- Come on, let's go.

470
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,114
They're not too happy
about that jeep, by the way.

471
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,986
I'll find her.

472
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:21,216
You know, I don't even know your name.

473
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,015
Tru.

474
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:26,995
Tru. You're not really a nurse, are you?

475
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,527
What makes you say that?

476
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,468
You're some sort of angel.

477
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:09,328
Can I help you?

478
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,637
I'm looking for Bridget Elkins.
The registrar said she was here.

479
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,076
She was, yes.
But you just missed her.

480
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:19,014
The class ended five minutes ago.
Do you know where she is now?

481
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,550
Is Bridget in some sort of trouble?

482
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,779
It's her grandmother. Nothing serious.

483
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:26,017
She slipped in the tub again,
and Mr. Elkins asked me to find her.

484
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,958
Let me see, if it helps you,
she normally meets Phillip after class.

485
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:31,851
- Phillip?
- Yeah.

486
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,989
They're quite
the popular couple on campus.

487
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:37,057
Try the Metzler Building, 212.
He should be finishing up there.

488
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:38,830
Thanks.

489
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,219
Thanks, Regina. Say bye, Phillip.

490
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:06,485
Bye.

491
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,891
- Bridget?
- Yes?

492
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,504
- He's beautiful, your boy.
- Thank you.

493
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,067
He looks just like his father.

494
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:21,071
What?

495
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,511
Listen, I'm a friend of Jake's.

496
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,708
He needs to see you, both of you.

497
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:26,943
What?

498
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,946
I haven't heard from Jake
in a year- and- a- half--

499
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,683
He may not survive the day.

500
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:42,592
This is all a little bit much, okay?

501
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,328
I haven't heard from Jake in 18 months.

502
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,870
- Suddenly you show up--
- He doesn't know about Phillip.

503
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:49,566
Why does that sound
like some sort of accusation?

504
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,168
It's not.

505
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:57,678
I found out I was pregnant
the day he was shipped out.

506
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,979
And I tried to contact him,
but I couldn't.

507
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,517
Obviously, he had no interest
in reaching me.

508
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:07,446
You sent him a telegram.
You told him not to contact you.

509
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:11,254
What? Telegram?
I don't know what he's told you, but....

510
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,599
I'm over him.
I don't know why I'm getting so upset.

511
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,762
He wants to see you
before he goes into surgery.

512
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:22,362
We could be at the hospital
in under an hour.

513
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,809
Ten years ago, I lost someone that I love.

514
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:30,575
And not a day goes by that I don't wish
I could see her one more time.

515
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,677
You still have that chance, Bridget.

516
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,720
Sorry. I can't.

517
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,557
I lost him once, I can't lose him again.

518
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,435
Guardian angel or stalker?

519
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,379
You decide.

520
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:06,011
I was in the neighborhood.

521
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,282
How are you feeling?

522
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:12,983
As soon as I'm stable,
they're taking me to surgery.

523
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:16,320
After that, anyone's guess.

524
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:18,855
- I'm so sorry, Jake.
- For what?

525
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,359
I was supposed to help you.

526
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:24,959
You wanted to see her,
and I couldn't do what you asked.

527
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,427
Don't do that.

528
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,507
- You tried.
- I failed.

529
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:35,776
What? You didn't fail.
Why are you being so hard on yourself?

530
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,649
I saw where she lives.

531
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:42,382
I know she's in school.

532
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,488
She sounds happy. Healthy.

533
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,892
She was more alive for me today
than she has been in two years.

534
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,527
That's nothing to apologize for.

535
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,636
I thought he was never gonna go down.

536
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:10,904
You hungry? There's--
No, thanks.

537
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:16,446
A crazy thing happened today.
This woman came by...

538
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,547
- said Jake wanted to see me.
- Really?

539
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:26,657
She seems convinced that I sent him
some stupid breakup telegram.

540
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:29,693
Listen, there's a lot of odd people
in the world.

541
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,257
Nothing to take to heart.

542
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:38,708
Please, tell me it wasn't you, Daddy.

543
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,677
Sweetheart--

544
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:42,746
Tell me that
you didn't sign my name.

545
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,372
- That you didn't send it.
- Look at me.

546
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,848
Not until you say
that you didn't send it.

547
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,344
Because he's sick.

548
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,855
He could die.

549
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,926
You had your whole future ahead of you.

550
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:03,394
Princeton, Stanford,
you could have gone anywhere.

551
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,233
My God.

552
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,667
- I knew it.
- You got knocked up by a soldier.

553
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,969
You were the top of your class.
He was enlisted--

554
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:13,703
- I loved him!
- Where did that get you?

555
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:16,803
Running between daycare
and some third- rate community college.

556
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,405
You could've been great.

557
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:22,475
You are my father, you're supposed
to love me no matter what I am.

558
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:34,494
You ever wonder how one little decision
can change your whole life?

559
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,763
All the time.

560
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,096
If I didn't join the Army....

561
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:41,900
You never would've been stationed here.
You never would've met Bridget.

562
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,037
Maybe I would have met her
somewhere else.

563
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,203
I would've had a nine to five,
a house and kids.

564
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,444
Man, we would have had some cute kids.

565
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,085
Jake, listen....

566
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:08,889
I'm sure you would have.

567
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:14,570
Excuse me.

568
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:18,999
Hello?
<i>Hey, hey. </i>

569
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,010
Why don't you come meet me
so we can celebrate?

570
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,341
<i>I can't make it tonight. </i>

571
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:24,881
But congratulations, Harry.

572
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,008
<i>Not sure how you knew, </i>
<i>but thanks to you...</i>

573
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,211
she offered it to me on the spot.

574
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,276
<i>That's great. </i>

575
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,049
I'm so happy for you.

576
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,921
And, thanks to me, I turned it down.

577
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,123
You know, screw the guy
if he can't love me for who I am.

578
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:40,753
<i>I'II see you, okay? </i>

579
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,871
- Bridget.
- Hi, Jake.

580
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:56,741
You came.

581
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,117
God, look at you.

582
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:05,513
You look beautiful.

583
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,528
Jake, there's someone I want you to meet.

584
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,159
You have a son.

585
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,931
We do. Phillip, say hi to your daddy.

586
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,135
Hey.

587
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,659
How did we screw things up so bad?

588
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,721
- Don't talk.
- Were we too proud?

589
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,531
Too stupid?

590
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,501
Here we go, Corporal.

591
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,929
All that matters is I'm here now.

592
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,932
So whatever happens to me,
I want you to have a good life.

593
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:03,377
I want you to marry.
I want Phillip to have a father.

594
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,812
He has a father.

595
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:09,150
Have a good life, Bridge. Promise me.

596
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,580
Jake, you're gonna be fine.

597
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:16,253
Promise me, Bridge.

598
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,187
Take care of him.

599
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:46,151
It's taking so long.

600
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,566
- It was a risk. We all knew that.
- What?

601
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,737
Oh, my God.

602
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,812
I am so sorry.

603
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,098
I lost him.

604
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:33,227
You didn't lose him, Tru.
His time was just up.

605
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,136
Jake knew he wouldn't survive the surgery.

606
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,969
That's why he asked you for your help.

607
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,509
But it's my job to prevent death.

608
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,902
To save people. All that.

609
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,909
Well, maybe Jake wasn't the one
who needed saving.

610
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,844
Maybe you saved the person
you were supposed to.

611
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,817
Bridget.

612
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,890
You let her say goodbye,
because yesterday, she wasn't able to.

613
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:02,396
- This job's just confusing sometimes.
- I know.

614
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,868
That's why you have me.

615
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,301
<i>

616
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,538
Key under the mat, right?

617
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,415
You made it.
Yeah. Did you ever think I wouldn't?

618
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,716
No. Never.

619
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,657
- You okay?
- Better now.

620
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:37,322
Why don't you relax?
There's just one thing I gotta do.

621
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,736
<i>Leave a message</i>
<i>at the beep. </i>

622
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:44,673
Hey, Dad. It's Tru.

623
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,537
I know we haven't talked in a while...

624
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:52,842
but I want you to know I'm doing okay.

625
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,278
I have a new job.

626
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,948
I guess you could say I help people.

627
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:03,794
Sometimes, if I'm lucky, they even help me.

628
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:07,396
That's why I'm calling.

629
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:14,002
Because I know how hard it is
for two people to find each other.

630
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:18,173
Especially when one of them
doesn't want to be found.

631
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,875
So, good night, Dad...

632
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:26,806
I hope you're happy and well, because I am.

633
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:32,454
And from now on,
you don't have to try to find me...

634
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,252
because suddenly...

635
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,320
I don't feel lost.

636
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,654
<i>

637
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:51,400
Sorry.

638
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,709
Long day.

639
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,508
Tell me about it.
