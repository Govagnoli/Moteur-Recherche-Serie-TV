1
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,778
Valentine's Day.

2
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,310
Somehow, even the morgue
seems more romantic.

3
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,212
When do you guys leave
for the big weekend?

4
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:52,183
Harrison's picking me up in the morning.

5
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,015
He tell you where you're going yet?

6
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,783
Someplace up in the mountains.
Pinetop Cabins.

7
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:59,825
He says it's supposed to be beautiful.
So what about you and Luc?

8
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,259
He found this little bed- and- breakfast
up the coast...

9
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,228
and he's picking me up
right after my shift.

10
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:05,821
How sweet are our guys.

11
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,232
Valentine's Day comes up and
they put together fabulous weekends...

12
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:12,327
- for their respective hotties.
- Don't you love this time of year?

13
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,906
Valentine's Day is a sham...

14
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:17,875
perpetuated by the floral and
greeting card industries to move product.

15
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:22,515
You'll have to excuse Davis.
He's very single.

16
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:25,715
Shocker. So, I'll see you Monday.

17
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:27,582
Have a great weekend.

18
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,587
- You, too.
- I will.

19
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,455
So, are you working tomorrow?

20
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,753
Yep, filling in for one of the married guys.

21
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,662
I gotta tell you, Davis,
this weekend can't start soon enough.

22
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,699
I so need a break from my job.

23
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,735
This one or the secret one?

24
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,199
For a change, both.

25
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:24,710
Help me.

26
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:56,939
You're up.

27
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,971
Thank God.
I was about to check for a pulse.

28
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,575
When I picked you up at the morgue...

29
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:06,050
you said you were gonna close your eyes
for five minutes.

30
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,984
That was four hours ago.

31
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:17,453
Oh, no. This can't be good.

32
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,007
There's been some flash flooding
up ahead, sir.

33
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,940
Road's closed for the next 24 hours.

34
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,537
But we need to get through today.
This is the only road that goes through.

35
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,777
Sorry. If I were you,
I'd go back the way I came.

36
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,786
So we'll spend Valentine's Day at home.
No big deal.

37
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:45,890
<i>What are you Iooking for?</i>

38
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,623
According to this, we're just 50 miles from
the place Harrison and Lindsay went to.

39
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,427
Pinetop Cabins?
How did you know about that?

40
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:57,196
Harrison called me last week
and said something about a package deal.

41
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,134
My brother the romantic.

42
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,605
The point is
it's supposed to be really beautiful.

43
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,676
Harrison said it was beautiful?

44
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:07,212
I believe his exact words were,
"Rustic, yet romantic."

45
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,373
Come on, let's surprise him.

46
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,581
I've been craving chips
for the last 30 miles. You want anything?

47
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:19,955
I'm good.

48
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,023
Hello?

49
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:32,627
I just heard on the radio they closed 14.
I wanted to give you a heads up.

50
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,071
<i>Thanks, but we sort of found out</i>
<i>the hard way.</i>

51
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,138
How's everything in Morgue- ville?

52
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,509
It turns out I'm not spending
Valentine's Day alone after all.

53
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,380
No?
<i>I'm here with a Marissa Hatcher.</i>

54
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,544
Cops found her in McKinley Park
with her throat slit.

55
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,645
<i>Really?</i>
Yeah. The weird thing is...

56
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:53,089
the killer left a newspaper clipping
in the shape of a heart.

57
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,559
Some kind of a calling card or something.

58
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,893
God, there are a lot of freaks out there.

59
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,127
Poor girl.

60
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,862
Anyway, try to relax and have a good time.

61
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,438
Thanks, I will. I'll see you on Monday.

62
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,608
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.

63
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,010
It's okay.

64
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:19,508
You're not heading south by any chance,
because I could really use a lift.

65
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,443
I know what you're thinking:

66
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,218
Mysterious stranger asks pretty girl
for a ride.

67
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,556
It's like the first scene
in some bad horror flick, right?

68
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:29,856
Sort of.

69
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:34,093
I'm Kevin Rafferty, and my car broke down
just a few miles from here.

70
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,362
Good thing you're at a gas station.

71
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,029
Yeah. Well, the mechanic took off
for the holiday...

72
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:43,575
which kind of puts me in a bind because
I'm supposed to be meeting my girlfriend.

73
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,338
We've never spent
a Valentine's Day apart...

74
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,270
and I'd hate to start now.

75
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,910
I'd really like to help, but....

76
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,818
- No hitchhikers.
- Yeah.

77
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,916
Well, have a nice Valentine's Day.
You, too.

78
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:16,742
Has anyone seen my wallet?
It's red with a velcro snap.

79
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,403
- You must have just dropped it.
- Thanks.

80
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,348
Aren't you my little Good Samaritan.

81
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,213
Any idea how close we are to the motel?

82
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,615
I checked with the cashier.

83
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,712
15 miles, and we're supposed to look
for a painted sign.

84
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,984
Apparently, we can't miss it.

85
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,363
Is that what I think it is?

86
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,129
Leave it to Harrison.

87
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,761
All I tried to do
was take you away for a nice weekend.

88
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,999
- Here?
- I know it's a little creepy--

89
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,574
They've got their own cemetery.

90
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:53,202
No, that cemetery
is not part of the property. I asked.

91
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,438
I want to go home, Harrison.

92
00:06:55,715 --> 00:07:00,049
Look, they're supposed to have
this amazing waterfall around here.

93
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,247
I was thinking
we could go for a hike tomorrow...

94
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,489
have a little picnic...

95
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:09,619
maybe watch some birds or something.
I don't know.

96
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:14,358
- You would go hiking?
- For you? Absolutely.

97
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,645
"Rustic, yet romantic."

98
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,085
We're all set with towels, thanks.

99
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,651
It's me, Harry.

100
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,128
<i>The owner toId me where to find you.</i>

101
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,499
Hey.

102
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,002
What the hell
are you doing here?

103
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,545
We couldn't make it to the coast.
The road was closed.

104
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,911
I tried both your cells,
but I couldn't get through.

105
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,076
The radio said some relay tower
got hit by lightning last night.

106
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,553
- There's no reception for miles.
- We were thinking of getting a room.

107
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,783
Great! The more the merrier.

108
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,223
<i>You two go check in.</i>

109
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:17,388
Once you're settled, we'll grab dinner
in the main cabin. My treat.

110
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,255
I thought you said meals were included.

111
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,196
lxnay, baby. We'll see you in 30.

112
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,072
Look, I know this isn't exactly
what I promised.

113
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,439
Luc, really, it's you and me.
Anywhere would be fine.

114
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,240
You sure?

115
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,301
Yeah.

116
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,310
We meet again.
Hey.

117
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,545
Tru?

118
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:49,227
- I asked her for a ride a few miles back.
- At the gas station. You were inside.

119
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,359
It's okay. Hank picked me up
a few miles down the road.

120
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,365
I'm really sorry.
Me, too.

121
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,993
If I'd known we were both going
to the Pinetop Cabins...

122
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,071
I could've caught you a discount
on your room.

123
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,196
My sister owns the place.

124
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,833
Hey, Kevin.

125
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:04,910
- Hey.
- Hi.

126
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,102
You made it.

127
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,409
- Welcome.
- This is Hank. He gave me a ride.

128
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,779
Hi, come on in.

129
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,143
The way I see it,
you just fix up some of these cabins...

130
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,553
clear out some of those graves,
and Pinetop Cabins Motel...

131
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:21,286
is Pinetop Cabins Resort and Spa.

132
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,162
Am I boring you, honey?

133
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,536
No, it's just that poor guy...

134
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,234
all alone on Valentine's Day.

135
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,103
Maybe he wants to be alone.

136
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:41,337
- Who cares?
- I care. I think it's sad.

137
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,504
Awww.

138
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,073
- Some meal.
- Yeah, it's good stuff.

139
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,140
What?

140
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,111
Nothing.

141
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,687
Just wish you wouldn't always worry
about everyone else.

142
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,783
So what are you saying?
What, you think I'm a busybody?

143
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,828
Only when it comes to everyone else.

144
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,990
Who's still got room for dessert?
You're right.

145
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:03,297
I should become more like you
and think only about myself.

146
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,768
- All the time.
- You calling me selfish?

147
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:08,534
I'm not the one who used up
all the hot water in the cabin.

148
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,838
So I like long showers. Sue me.

149
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,676
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

150
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:14,974
In private.

151
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:23,448
- I'm breaking up with him, Tru. Tonight.
- It's Valentine's Day.

152
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:24,580
Yeah, right.

153
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:28,991
The most romantic day of the year,
and Harrison and I can't stop fighting.

154
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,926
Wait. You're not mad, are you?

155
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:37,232
No, of course not.
It's just you guys are my best friends.

156
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:41,432
And we still will be.
We just won't make out as much.

157
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,272
I guess
they finally fixed the relay towers.

158
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:52,010
At least something
went right tonight, right?

159
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,789
Happy Valentine's Day.

160
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,898
Luc, they're beautiful. Where did you--

161
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,529
Someone just left them there
on one of those graves in the cemetery.

162
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,335
I figured they probably
didn't need it anymore, so I....

163
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,276
I'm kidding. They were stashed in my bag.

164
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,710
Come here.

165
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,178
You're dumping me?

166
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,811
We fight all the time, Harrison,
about everything.

167
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:32,485
You know, I actually thought this weekend
would make things better for us.

168
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:33,990
Maybe it did.

169
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:39,491
Look, I'm just gonna go for a walk,
so if you want the bed....

170
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,658
No, I'll take the cot.

171
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,158
The bed smells funny.

172
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,402
Damn.

173
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,465
Hello?

174
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,948
Harrison, if that's you....

175
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,846
Hello?

176
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,061
God, you scared me!

177
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:49,062
- What are you doing?
- I was just getting ice. Are you okay?

178
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:53,628
Yeah, sorry.
I thought I heard a noise in the woods.

179
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:57,175
Sorry, this place is just sort of creepy.

180
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,608
What, the motel with its own graveyard?

181
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,942
Go figure. See you.

182
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,909
<i>HeIp me.</i>

183
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,118
<i>PIease.</i>

184
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,256
Is anybody out there?

185
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,119
Kevin.

186
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,501
I need you.

187
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,744
You're up.

188
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:16,845
What?

189
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,584
Thank God.
I was about to check for a pulse.

190
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,436
- Who are you calling?
- Harrison, to warn him.

191
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,333
About?

192
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,371
Lindsay's allergies.

193
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:43,745
He was gonna cook her dinner tonight,
but if he makes anything with peanuts....

194
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,222
A relay tower
got hit by lightning last night.

195
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,620
<i>There's no reception for miles.</i>

196
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:55,183
Oh, no. This can't be good.

197
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,395
There's been some flash flooding
up ahead, sir.

198
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,058
Road's closed for the next 24 hours.

199
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,897
We need to get through today.
Only this road goes through.

200
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:08,132
Sorry. If I were you,
I'd go back the way I came.

201
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:11,809
So, here's a crazy idea.

202
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,641
We're not too far from the place
Harrison and Lindsay went to.

203
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,972
Pinetop Cabins.

204
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,380
I was thinking
maybe we could go there, too.

205
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,975
That's so weird.
I was just thinking that same thing.

206
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,283
And if you see a gas station,
could you pull over?

207
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:26,381
- I've got this weird craving for chips.
- Chips.

208
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,124
Bag of chips coming right up.

209
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,712
<i>Hello?</i>
Davis, it's me.

210
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,115
I was just getting ready to call you.
<i>I know.</i>

211
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:56,086
I get it. Do- over day.
What have you got for me victim- wise?

212
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:59,147
His name's Kevin Rafferty.
He was killed at the motel we went to.

213
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,191
Slit throat.

214
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,193
When I found him, there was
a newspaper heart next to the body.

215
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,719
- Sound familiar?
- Two victims, same M. O. Sounds like--

216
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,288
A serial killer. I know.

217
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,926
<i>Serves me right for thinking</i>
<i>I was gonna get a vacation.</i>

218
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,300
These things do happen
at the worst possible times.

219
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,167
All the better to ruin my life.

220
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,741
Tell me everything you know
about the first murder.

221
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,506
And tell me fast. I'm gonna be meeting
victim number two any second now.

222
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,408
According to the police report...

223
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,949
a witness saw a man
leave the scene of the crime.

224
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,279
What else?

225
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,043
There's some residue on the paper heart.

226
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,089
<i>Specks of something.</i>
<i>I can't tell what.</i>

227
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,283
I'll do a chemical analysis
and get back to you.

228
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,021
Fine, but you won't be able to reach me
until 6:03 tonight.

229
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,653
<i>Why not?</i>
Phone issues.

230
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,664
Just find out everything you can by then.

231
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,393
What are you gonna do in the meantime?

232
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,800
Anything it takes to keep Kevin away
from that motel tonight.

233
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,865
I gotta go, Davis.

234
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,597
Let me guess. You need a lift.

235
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:54,435
Yeah, just up to the Pinetop Cabins Motel.
It's not very far.

236
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:55,945
That's fine by me...

237
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,246
but we should check and see
if it's cool with my boyfriend.

238
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,376
Great.

239
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,358
That's him right there,
if you want to ask him.

240
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,135
Has anyone seen my wallet?
It's red with a velcro snap.

241
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:22,401
He's got it. I just saw him snatch it
right off the counter.

242
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,668
That's not true.

243
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,836
- If you don't believe me, check in his bag.
- What?

244
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,546
All right, let's take a look.

245
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,962
I did not take that, I swear.

246
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,965
Right. Never heard of that one before.

247
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,996
I don't understand you.
Why are you doing this to me?

248
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,334
It's not what you think, it's....

249
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,737
I'm just trying to help.

250
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,934
Come on, let's get out of here now.

251
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:12,252
I'm gonna go talk to Harrison.
I'll be right back.

252
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,951
How do you know which cabin he's in?

253
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:17,518
Four. It's Harrison's lucky number.
He always stays in four.

254
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,530
Fine, we'll stay.
Yes.

255
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,730
We're all set with--
Open up, you guys. It's me.

256
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:29,899
Tru?

257
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:37,606
Hey, guys.

258
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,083
The road was closed.
We couldn't make it to the coast.

259
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,313
We decided to come here instead.
Luc's out front.

260
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,014
- Great.
- I need to talk to Harrison...

261
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,954
about something, in private.

262
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:51,020
- So you got the poor schnook arrested?
- To save his life, yeah.

263
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,894
Unbelievable. A serial killer, here.

264
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,730
That's right. So I want you and Lindsay
to pack your things.

265
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,667
We're all going home. I won't take no--

266
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,501
Relax, you had me at"serial killer."
I'm out of here.

267
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,234
Good.
But wait.

268
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,311
Shouldn't we call the cops?
Tell them we got a whack job loose?

269
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,175
I'd love to, but we don't have any proof.

270
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,648
And if we told them I was reliving a day,
they'd think we were insane.

271
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:15,881
Let's call the tabloids, tell them you had
a psychic premonition about the killer.

272
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:19,287
- How would that help?
- It wouldn't, but we could make a mint.

273
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,493
Think about it.

274
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,024
Pack your stuff.
We're out of this dump.

275
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,124
What?

276
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:33,365
You were right about everything.
I should've taken you someplace nicer.

277
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,373
- My bad.
- But you just talked me into staying.

278
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:40,275
Here? Are you kidding?
They've got their own cemetery.

279
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,607
Okay.

280
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:47,247
Bad news. Harrison says
the cabins have rats. We can't stay.

281
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,618
- But I just checked in.
- So check out. We'll go someplace else.

282
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,090
Trust me,
this is not the place we want to be, okay?

283
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,360
All right. I'll be right back.

284
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,297
We meet again.

285
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,496
- You surprised to see me?
- You have no idea.

286
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,440
Your little prank almost worked.

287
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,684
Till I realized that the Mini- Mart
had a security camera.

288
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,812
I told the sheriff to check the tape.
Guess what he saw.

289
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,222
I know it doesn't seem like it right now,
but it was for your own good.

290
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:30,386
Framing me for petty larceny
was for my own good?

291
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,788
I don't know what you're doing
at my sister's motel.

292
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:37,357
But I suggest that you leave
before I call the cops.

293
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,493
Kevin. Hey...

294
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,806
You made it.

295
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:45,802
- Hi.
- Hank. I gave your brother a ride.

296
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,474
Hey.
Hi.

297
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,053
There's been a change of plans.
I'm staying.

298
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:58,111
What?

299
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,385
The victim just showed up.
I can't leave him.

300
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,927
- So what do we do now?
- "We" aren't doing anything.

301
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,589
You're taking Lindsay back to the city,
like we agreed.

302
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,565
There's no way I'm leaving you here
with a psycho on the loose.

303
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:11,125
- So I'll send Lindsay back with Luc.
- Right.

304
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,433
And how are you gonna explain that one?

305
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:17,099
Besides, now that victim boy's here,
we're all perfectly safe.

306
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,642
We can't be sure about that.

307
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,769
We've already started
making changes to the day.

308
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,211
Changes that could affect
yesterday's outcome.

309
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,876
Meaning tonight's victim could be....

310
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,342
Me?

311
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,114
Honestly, there's no way to know.

312
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,922
All right. If I bite it, I bite it.

313
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,086
I'll ask you for help, the day will restart...

314
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,562
and we can do this crazy dance
all over again.

315
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:43,032
If I let you stay.
What are we gonna tell Luc and Lindsay?

316
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,299
The truth.

317
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,965
The first time I told you I relived days,
you thought I was insane.

318
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,539
In that case, we lie our asses off.

319
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:57,174
- So now you want to stay?
- It's not that I want to. I have to.

320
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,615
Harrison and Lindsay
are in the middle of a nasty....

321
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,415
...fight. As much as I'd like to take you
someplace nice....

322
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,955
...I just don't feel right
leaving them here alone.

323
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,050
Maybe they should be alone
so they can work it out for themselves.

324
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,321
I don't think that'll happen.
Harrison's being....

325
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:13,660
- ...totally unreasonable.
- That doesn't sound like Tru.

326
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,030
That's what I'm saying.
She's not being herself.

327
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,331
I think I should spend some time
alone with her...

328
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,303
so I can figure out what's what, because....

329
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,339
...they're gonna break up.

330
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,606
- All right, is there anything I can do?
- No.

331
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,646
So just sit here. Don't move.

332
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:33,183
As soon as I talk some sense
into my sister, I will be back.

333
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:35,852
I'll go check in. Again.

334
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,826
- How'd it go?
- Piece of cake. You?

335
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:46,991
So what's next?

336
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:50,501
One of us should keep an eye on Kevin
while the other looks for suspects.

337
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:51,593
We got any?

338
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,696
Davis said a man was seen
leaving the scene of the first murder...

339
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,364
in McKinley Park.

340
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,841
Great. So how many dudes
are staying here...

341
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,377
that aren't me, Luc, or the victim?

342
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,710
Two suspects.
One guy gave Kevin a ride today.

343
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:09,515
The other guy was at dinner last night.
Older guy with glasses.

344
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,715
Yeah, he checked in with me and Lindsay.

345
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,918
His name's Carl.
Okay.

346
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:19,589
Can you believe we're in a motel
with a cemetery next door...

347
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,291
and a frigging psycho on the loose?

348
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,596
Can it get any more <i>Friday the 13th?</i>

349
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,363
No, this is <i>Summer Camp.</i>

350
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:28,304
- Whatever.
- Harry, be careful.

351
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:32,307
I've got Tru Davies as my sister.
I don't need to be careful.

352
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:46,088
- I thought I told you to leave.
- You did, and I was going to.

353
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,386
Why are you still here?

354
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:50,826
I feel bad about what happened today,
and I wanted to apologize.

355
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,831
You tried to get me arrested.
Saying sorry is not gonna cut it.

356
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,459
It's hard to believe,
but I was trying to protect you.

357
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:57,524
From what?

358
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,626
Kevin.

359
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,574
Is there a problem?
No.

360
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:05,601
No.

361
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,870
No problem, Eileen.
Just a little misunderstanding.

362
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,851
Good. I was hoping
you'd get me some wood from out back.

363
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,179
I hope you can forgive my brother.

364
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,415
He always gets so worked up
this time of year.

365
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:27,947
It's Valentine's Day.
I'm sure he's got big plans tonight.

366
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,489
He told me he was meeting his girlfriend.

367
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:37,134
He hadn't mentioned it to me,
but big sister's always the last to know.

368
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,432
Keep an eye on him tonight, okay?

369
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,133
I always do.

370
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:47,876
Since our parents died, he's all I've got.
I don't know what I'd do without him.

371
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,292
What are you doing in my cabin?

372
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:18,098
Your cabin? I thought this was....

373
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,505
Wake up, Harrison!

374
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,479
So you walked in here by mistake?

375
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,480
Yeah, I got in here, and I was like:

376
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:31,682
"Where's my stuff and my girl?
Who cut up all these crazy newspapers?"

377
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,690
- That would be me.
- Really?

378
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:39,362
Putting together a little ransom note,
are we?

379
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,101
My wife's obituaries.
She passed away last week.

380
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,507
I'm sorry to hear that.

381
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,911
I know it seems morbid...

382
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,481
but the papers said such lovely things
about her.

383
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:01,245
According to this,
the funeral was yesterday in Philly.

384
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:06,718
And you were there.
It was a beautiful ceremony.

385
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,492
So you couldn't have been
in McKinley Park last night.

386
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:10,822
Pardon?

387
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:12,861
Is that....

388
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,257
My wife's ashes.

389
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,595
She asked that they be scattered here.

390
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,468
I'm sorry about the mixup,
but I've gotta go.

391
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,976
Carl's not our guy. He was in Philly
when the murder occurred.

392
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,013
You're positive?

393
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:32,106
I've got his wife's ashes to prove it.
On my hand.

394
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:34,048
That leaves the guy with the pickup truck.

395
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,882
What cabin is he in? I'll check him out.

396
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:39,321
We should switch up. Kevin made it clear
he doesn't want me around.

397
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,222
I'll take Kevin. You take the other guy.

398
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:44,921
- If you see anything suspicious--
- I'll scream like a little girl.

399
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,021
I'll come find you. Whichever.

400
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,232
Come in.

401
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,532
Hey.

402
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,844
Come on in, have a seat.

403
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,375
I was just wondering if you'd heard
anything from Tru or Harrison.

404
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,146
Zilch. You?
Nothing.

405
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,947
Some Valentine's Day.

406
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,157
It could be worse.

407
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,917
We could be single.

408
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:21,096
In which case, I'd probably be moping
around my apartment right now...

409
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:24,897
watching dopey Meg Ryan movies
and eating ice cream.

410
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,464
Damn, I wish I was single.

411
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:34,277
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but what set off the big fight?

412
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,280
Sorry?
The fight.

413
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,575
Tru told me about it.

414
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,753
You and Harrison are fighting, right?

415
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:47,015
No, you and Tru
are the ones fighting, right?

416
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:48,717
No.

417
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,528
Right on time, Davis.
Tell me something good.

418
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,331
The lab guys just finished analyzing
the residue on the paper heart.

419
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,371
<i>And?</i>

420
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,305
They identified the substance
as tobacco flakes.

421
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:07,401
Tar and nicotine levels are consistent
with a certain brand of cigarettes:

422
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,207
<i>Bullseye Lights.</i>

423
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,407
So keep an eye out for smokers.
Got it. Thanks.

424
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,848
There's more.

425
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,011
I did a little research this afternoon
on our serial killer.

426
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,078
The cops are trying to keep this quiet.

427
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:21,216
It turns out there were five murders
over the last two years.

428
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:22,919
All with the same M. O.

429
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:26,191
<i>All five occurred</i>
<i>on or around VaIentine's Day.</i>

430
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:29,591
So he's killed even more people
than we thought? Wonderful.

431
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,430
Say the word, and I'll meet you there.

432
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,437
<i>There's no way you'd make it in time.</i>

433
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,005
Just sit tight.
I'll call you if I need anything.

434
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,876
You want to tell me
what you think you're doing?

435
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:16,778
- Luc, what are you--
- You're the one breaking into a pickup.

436
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:19,078
So you answer my question first.

437
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:21,710
I was turning the lights off.

438
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:25,222
He left them on,
and I just didn't want it to kill the battery.

439
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,452
I guess you and Harrison
worked everything out.

440
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:28,924
I guess you and Harrison
worked everything out.

441
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:32,756
Yeah, it wasn't easy,
but I think I finally got through to him.

442
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,628
I talked to Lindsay.

443
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:39,794
We know you guys lied to us.

444
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,505
- Luc, you don't understand.
- No, I think I do.

445
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:47,066
This is the part where you tell me
your life's really complicated, right?

446
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:50,739
That you take off without explanation,
and I just have to deal with it.

447
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,316
No, I just--
Here I am...

448
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:56,012
thinking you're the most amazing girl
I've gotten to know in a long time.

449
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:59,181
And the truth is
I don't really know you at all.

450
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:04,717
Luc.

451
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:13,030
Next time you break into a man's vehicle...

452
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:15,595
don't get into a shouting match
outside his cabin.

453
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:16,901
It tends to wake a body up.

454
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,999
I know what you're up to,
and I'm warning you.

455
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,578
- Stay away from Kevin Rafferty.
- What?

456
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,169
You heard me.

457
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:30,017
You're the second person I met today
that smokes that brand.

458
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:33,086
- These aren't yours?
- Of course not.

459
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:36,484
I've got severe asthma. I can't smoke.

460
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,490
Damn it.

461
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,735
If these aren't yours, then whose are they?

462
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:51,603
Kevin's. He probably dropped them
getting out of the truck.

463
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,074
Kevin's?

464
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,978
There you are.
I was just gonna come look for you.

465
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,148
Save it, okay?

466
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:09,557
I don't know what you and Tru are up to,
and I don't even want to know.

467
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:12,095
But whatever it is,
I'm sure it's mostly your fault.

468
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,960
Whoa, whoa. Calm down.

469
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,064
First thing in the morning,
you'll take me home.

470
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:20,332
But, baby--
No, Harrison, really. No buts.

471
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:24,931
And no more of your stories.
This time, we're through.

472
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:34,540
Uh, Kevin?

473
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,952
Damn it.

474
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:44,492
Terbutaline. That's only prescribed
for people with life- threatening asthma.

475
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:46,928
- So the cigarettes belong to Kevin?
- Right.

476
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,558
<i>Which makes him the seriaI killer.</i>
Right again.

477
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,865
Well, if Kevin is the serial killer,
then who killed Kevin?

478
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:56,336
I'm thinking maybe Kevin went looking
for another victim last night.

479
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,238
And that victim turned the tables on him.

480
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,777
Right. The only question now is who.

481
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:08,049
Come on. You've gotta be kidding me.

482
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:12,053
Locked out?

483
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,717
Yeah, you work here?

484
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,087
My sister owns the place.

485
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,756
She went for a walk,
but I was just about to go find her.

486
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,130
If you want to come with,
I'll get you another key.

487
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,169
You are a lifesaver.

488
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,302
Lead the way.

489
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:42,720
The guy with the pickup
isn't the serial killer. Kevin is.

490
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,721
- What?
- There are two killers.

491
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:48,555
Kevin killed the girl in McKinley Park,
and someone else killed him last night.

492
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,787
Davis and I think
it must be someone he attacked.

493
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,353
That doesn't make
what I have to tell you any easier.

494
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:55,626
- Kevin took off. I lost him.
- You what?

495
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,225
And Lindsay stopped by to chew me out.

496
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:00,236
I only took my eyes off him
for two seconds.

497
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,670
Great. That means he's still in danger.

498
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:06,505
So what if he's in danger?
The guy's a serial killer.

499
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:09,011
Let's knock off
and let nature take its course.

500
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,981
You don't get it.
Everything you and I did today...

501
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,814
that we didn't do yesterday,
it changed fate.

502
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:15,910
So?

503
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,478
So things might play out differently
this time.

504
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,491
Maybe the person Kevin attacks
doesn't fend him off tonight.

505
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,151
Maybe that person dies instead of him.

506
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,387
Evening.

507
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:29,922
- Carl, buddy, what's shaking?
- I was about to ask you the same question.

508
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:33,060
I just saw your lady friend
walking off with another fellow.

509
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,230
What? Who?

510
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,908
Eileen's brother. She introduced me once,
I forget his name.

511
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,671
Which direction did they go?

512
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,681
And then,
as if things weren't bad enough...

513
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,617
he leaves me sitting in the room alone
for three hours and....

514
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,283
Are you sure this is the way
your sister went?

515
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,416
I want you to meet someone.

516
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,564
My girlfriend, Amanda.

517
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,930
We never spent a Valentine's Day apart.

518
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,003
This is a joke, right?

519
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,743
She died three years ago. A car crash.

520
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:20,849
Have you ever lost someone close to you?

521
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,411
It changes you.

522
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,982
It separates you from other people.

523
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:31,790
They say they're sorry.
They bring flowers, they send cards.

524
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:35,730
But they don't really understand
what you're going through.

525
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,258
They don't know
what it meant to lose her.

526
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,599
That's why I do this.

527
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:46,540
So that other people will know
what it feels like.

528
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:51,346
I want them to understand, just like...

529
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:56,378
the people who love you
are going to understand.

530
00:35:58,422 --> 00:35:59,855
Oh, my God!

531
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,421
Are you all right?

532
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,826
Yeah, I think so.

533
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,230
You okay?

534
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,111
So I guess we finally figured out
who iced the guy.

535
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,342
Yeah, I guess. It's just....

536
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:31,612
What?

537
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,623
Are you okay?

538
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,818
Sorry, this place is just sort of creepy.

539
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:38,621
No, it couldn't have been Lindsay.

540
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,096
I saw her yesterday
just before I found the body.

541
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,564
<i>She was fine.</i>

542
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,627
So who the hell killed this guy?

543
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,682
You.

544
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,409
The killer has to be someone
who knew the truth.

545
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,885
He said that was his girlfriend.

546
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,724
What was that, sweetie?

547
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,921
He said that was his girlfriend.

548
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,637
He told me he was meeting his girlfriend.

549
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:21,899
He hadn't mentioned it to me.

550
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:25,236
Eileen. She was covering for him.

551
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,841
You always looked after me.
You always took care of me.

552
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:31,506
<i>PIease don't stop now, all right? Kill me.</i>

553
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:33,914
Kill me before I hurt someone else, please.

554
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:37,079
I can't. I'm your sister. I love you.

555
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:40,121
If that's true,
then you will put an end to all of this.

556
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,386
Once and for all, I'm begging you.

557
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,588
Kevin.

558
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,057
Please.

559
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,490
Don't do it, Eileen.

560
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,594
I would never.

561
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:56,998
He's my brother.

562
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,400
How long have you been protecting him?

563
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,203
I haven't.

564
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,248
He confessed everything to me
just before you came to the cabin.

565
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:09,719
I begged him to go to the police,
but he promised he wouldn't kill again.

566
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:14,018
I believed it,
until I saw him following your friend.

567
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,453
And then I knew he couldn't stop.

568
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:22,329
Do it, please!
Kill me, please, before I kill again.

569
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,300
No, I can't. I'm sorry.

570
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,103
But we'll get you help.
The best doctors.

571
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:31,369
I don't want their help.
I wanted yours, but if you can't--

572
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,705
No, Kevin, don't. Please!

573
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,735
You're all I have.

574
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:39,683
I gotta be honest.
I don't even know if you deserve to live.

575
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,581
But I know if you go through with it...

576
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:45,110
you're not just killing yourself.
You're killing her, too.

577
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:08,272
Thank you.

578
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,949
So let me see
if I've got this straight.

579
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:17,617
Tru overheard this psycho confessing
a murder to his sister this afternoon.

580
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,653
And instead of going to the police--

581
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:22,284
Which she couldn't do
because the phones were down.

582
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,055
Right. She went to you.

583
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,130
So why didn't you tell me and Luc?

584
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,764
We didn't want you getting all freaked out.

585
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:33,269
Well, maybe if I was
a little more freaked out...

586
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,931
I wouldn't have gone for a walk
with the guy.

587
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:39,934
I can't believe
I almost broke up with you tonight.

588
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,671
What you did for me...

589
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:44,475
I didn't think a man could be that brave.

590
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,026
Look, I know I screwed up.

591
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,994
No, lives were at stake.
You did something good.

592
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:05,435
But for reasons I may never understand,
you felt like you couldn't come to me.

593
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:10,204
- I was trying to protect you.
- I didn't need you to protect me.

594
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,274
I never did.

595
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:18,041
What I needed was for you to let me in.
To be a part of your life.

596
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,783
But now....God, after this....

597
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,689
Luc, please. It won't happen again.

598
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:28,389
It will.

599
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,996
Maybe not the same way, but it will.

600
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:36,089
'Cause we're going in circles here, Tru.

601
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:39,728
We're running into the same problem
over and over again.

602
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:43,303
I just don't think one more chance
is gonna change that.

603
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:04,259
I went through hell this weekend.
And for what?

604
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:06,694
To save the life of a serial killer.

605
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:10,764
Now he's in prison. Some people
would say that's worse than death.

606
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,700
All I wanted was two days, Davis.

607
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:17,070
Two lousy days away from this job
and this thing that I do.

608
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,539
But I couldn't get away.

609
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:22,134
It followed me, and it cost me Luc
because I couldn't tell him the truth.

610
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:23,235
You have a calling.

611
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:25,838
A calling is something
you're destined to do.

612
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:29,442
Something that gives your life meaning,
that makes you happy.

613
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,250
What I do feels more like a curse.

614
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,389
Look, you were chosen for a reason.

615
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:40,191
Whoever gave you this gift
knew what they were doing.

616
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:43,165
They saw the same things in you
that I see in you:

617
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:46,328
strength, compassion, conviction.

618
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:51,404
Curse or calling, love it or hate it,
you are the right person for the job.

619
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:54,341
There's no doubt in my mind.
