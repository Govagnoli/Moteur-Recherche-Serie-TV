00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:03,726
<i>Previously on</i> Tru Calling:

2
00:00:03,893 --> 00:00:05,531
You're in medical school now.

3
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:07,689
Are you committed
to saving lives or not?

4
00:00:07,893 --> 00:00:09,372
Yes, I'm committed.

5
00:00:09,653 --> 00:00:11,450
Don't you see? I gave you a gift.

6
00:00:11,613 --> 00:00:14,332
I gave you the perfect excuse
to walk away.

7
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:16,489
Actually, you gave me
every reason to stay.

8
00:00:16,773 --> 00:00:20,561
You missed quite a day. Jack came back,
and my father moved to town.

9
00:00:20,893 --> 00:00:22,246
Are you offering me a job?

10
00:00:22,893 --> 00:00:24,884
What do you say?
Wanna work come for the old man?

11
00:00:25,053 --> 00:00:28,090
He does love his sister,
and that bond is stronger than you think.

12
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,244
So's the bond between father and son.

13
00:00:30,893 --> 00:00:33,691
Good people have to die too, Tru.
You know that as well as I.

14
00:00:33,853 --> 00:00:36,765
You say you're not a killer.
What do you call what you're doing?

15
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:38,247
My job.

17
00:01:35,693 --> 00:01:38,253
Every cadaver has a story.
Treat it with respect...

18
00:01:39,853 --> 00:01:42,003
...and you will be privileged
to learn from it.

19
00:01:42,213 --> 00:01:45,171
Break into groups. Four to a cadaver.

20
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:55,051
Excuse me.

21
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:58,808
Are you the girl who answered Seidel's
trick question and made him look bad?

22
00:01:58,973 --> 00:02:02,648
- I don't know if I made him look bad.
- Guys, this is her. We want you.

23
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:05,732
How awkward. She means
for our lab group. We need a fourth.

24
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:07,764
- And you want me?
- Absolutely.

25
00:02:07,973 --> 00:02:10,407
You cut Seidel off at the knees,
which was so hot.

26
00:02:10,853 --> 00:02:13,572
Obviously, you're brilliant,
and because you're auditing...

27
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,644
...you're not gonna affect
the grade curve.

28
00:02:15,813 --> 00:02:18,122
Tyler says
that you're the perfect woman.

29
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:21,171
- Jensen.
- Tru.

30
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:26,648
You got a really deft hand
with that duodenum.

31
00:02:26,853 --> 00:02:29,003
I suppose you hear that
all the time though.

32
00:02:29,173 --> 00:02:32,688
Thanks. Sorry, I work nights.
It was a long shift.

33
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:35,287
- Didn't get much sleep.
- You must get jaded quickly...

34
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:37,648
...if you're yawning in a room
with dead bodies.

35
00:02:37,813 --> 00:02:40,122
- What is with this bag?
- What's wrong with the bag?

36
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,568
- It's a gift for Lexi.
- Jensen looked up from his books...

37
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:45,691
...Iong enough to get a girlfriend.
We were all very relieved.

38
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:48,927
- "Essence of Roses."
- Essence of Roses.

39
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:50,851
Avery, what...? What are you doing?

40
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,005
I can't put it on myself.
What if I don't like it?

41
00:02:53,213 --> 00:02:54,646
I don't need you to analyze it.

42
00:02:54,813 --> 00:02:57,885
I need you to tell me if it's a gift
that says I care about you...

43
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,327
...or that you smell bad.

44
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:01,922
I don't know, it depends
on where she sprays it.

45
00:03:02,093 --> 00:03:03,321
Nice. Very nice.

46
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:06,127
That's no way to handle
a gallbladder, Mr. Lee.

47
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,005
- Oh.
- Oh.

48
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:10,403
Lexi's perfume.

49
00:03:10,613 --> 00:03:12,649
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:12,813 --> 00:03:15,452
Hey, smells better than formaldehyde.

51
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,607
What is that smell?

52
00:03:20,773 --> 00:03:22,092
What smell?

53
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:26,132
It smells like roses and formaldehyde.

54
00:03:26,613 --> 00:03:29,810
- So, Harry, what's with the camera?
- Oh, it's nothing.

55
00:03:29,973 --> 00:03:33,761
Just my first solo gig
at Dad's law firm.

56
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:35,924
The training wheels are off, baby.
Check it.

57
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,442
These two guys got in a fight
on a golf course...

58
00:03:38,613 --> 00:03:40,569
...and one of them is filing an A&B.

59
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:43,651
- A&B?
- Yeah, assault and battery charge.

60
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:46,532
He claims he was too hurt
that he couldn't leave the house.

61
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,765
Well, I happen to know
that he's a major hockey fan...

62
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:52,003
...and he's got tickets
to tonight's game.

63
00:03:52,213 --> 00:03:56,172
So you're gonna be taking shots of him
jumping up and high-fiving his friends.

64
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:59,570
And when I lay those pictures down
on Dad's desk, he's gonna love me.

65
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:01,325
Love me.

66
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,570
I'm glad you are getting along.
I know how much that means to you.

67
00:04:04,773 --> 00:04:07,651
Yeah, it's great. You know, you two
are getting along, right?

68
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:10,845
And... I don't know, maybe we were
just too hard on him.

69
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:13,763
Maybe.

70
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:18,883
- Hi, mind if I join you?
- Oh, Dr. Allen.

71
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,926
- No, go ahead.
- Oh, you can sit down.

72
00:04:23,173 --> 00:04:24,606
Oh, damn.

73
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:27,606
- I forgot to ask for sugar.
- Oh, have one of mine.

74
00:04:27,773 --> 00:04:30,526
- Oh, shoot.
- Is it all right?

75
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:33,645
Yeah, it's just a little
wool-polyester fiber.

76
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:35,127
Mmm.

77
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,642
Did you get the memo
about the fire drill?

78
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:43,323
- No, I didn't.
- Tomorrow afternoon.

79
00:04:43,493 --> 00:04:46,326
I like to warn people because
sometimes that alarm goes off...

80
00:04:46,493 --> 00:04:49,371
...at the most inconvenient times,
when you're in the toilet...

81
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:52,451
...or you're elbow deep
in someone's chest cavity, and...

82
00:04:57,973 --> 00:05:01,852
Well, I suppose I should go back
across the street.

83
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:03,532
- Okay.
- Bye.

84
00:05:03,693 --> 00:05:05,490
Bye.

85
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:07,166
Thanks.

86
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:13,331
I'm just cursed. I'm just...

88
00:05:14,693 --> 00:05:16,285
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

89
00:05:16,453 --> 00:05:18,683
When the saints were around
my cradle, they said:

90
00:05:18,853 --> 00:05:21,413
"He will be able to analyze 60 kinds
of bullet wounds...

91
00:05:21,573 --> 00:05:23,962
...but when it comes
to conversational skills, none."

92
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:26,044
I thought you didn't even like
small talk.

93
00:05:26,213 --> 00:05:29,523
- I hate small talk.
- So then why would it bother you if...?

94
00:05:29,693 --> 00:05:30,842
Ah.

95
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:33,485
What was that? What was that "ah"?

96
00:05:33,653 --> 00:05:36,008
It's just an "ah," Davis.
There's no agenda.

97
00:05:36,213 --> 00:05:37,487
Okay.

99
00:05:40,413 --> 00:05:42,085
- Harry.
- <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

100
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:44,966
- I got those pictures.
- Congratulations.

101
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:48,483
Yeah, it came at a price though.
The guy's got a mean right hook.

102
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:51,486
- Ouch.
- It's worth it. I can't wait to show Dad.

103
00:05:51,653 --> 00:05:53,883
I am so happy for you.
I'll call you later, okay?

104
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,327
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Bye.

105
00:05:59,213 --> 00:06:02,603
- Yeah, about the "ah"...
- Talk to her again.

106
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:04,764
Find a topic you can both
get excited about.

107
00:06:05,373 --> 00:06:09,207
I find that my interests don't overlap
with the rest of humanity's.

108
00:06:10,613 --> 00:06:13,889
Okay. Thomas Burrell, M.D.

109
00:06:14,053 --> 00:06:16,044
Looks like a note he 
scribbled to himself.

110
00:06:16,253 --> 00:06:18,244
- What is it, a grocery list?
- "Varden"...

111
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:19,971
...and an arrow pointing to "DSM3."

112
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:21,772
Must be a psychiatrist.

113
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,164
- How do you figure?
- Well, you see...

114
00:06:24,373 --> 00:06:25,647
Please.

115
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,893
Help me.

116
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:39,884
That's no way to hold
a gallbladder, Mr. Lee.

117
00:06:48,613 --> 00:06:51,173
I am so sorry.

118
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:57,684
I'll thank you not to bring your feminine
trinkets into the lab, Miss Davies.

119
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:01,167
No. I'm sorry, I'll go tell him
it was mine.

120
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:05,252
It's all right, but I have to go.

121
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:10,569
Is it me, or does Tru seem
a little abrupt?

122
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:28,772
Help me.

123
00:07:49,813 --> 00:07:51,087
- Hey.
- Hi.

124
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:52,527
- Is he in?
- Yes, go on in.

125
00:07:52,693 --> 00:07:53,967
Thanks.

126
00:07:59,973 --> 00:08:01,247
I rewound.

127
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:05,845
- Got it. Day two. Cause of death?
- Shot in the back at Fourth Street Market.

128
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:08,567
What's your strategy?
My daughter is expecting you...

129
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:12,686
...and her record's been good since Luc,
which was a stretch of the rules.

130
00:08:12,973 --> 00:08:15,806
I told you. Luc was meant as a lesson.

131
00:08:16,013 --> 00:08:18,004
Not a lesson she seems
to have learned from.

132
00:08:18,213 --> 00:08:19,885
I am not losing this guy to Jack.

133
00:08:20,093 --> 00:08:23,130
- You did well against him last time.
- <i>That's the point.</i>

134
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,769
There's an opportunity here
to take things to another level.

135
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:29,686
Learn from the mistake you made
with her mother.

136
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:31,969
- Marrying her?
- Killing her.

137
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:34,889
We know that won't help.

138
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:37,408
The ability only goes to someone else.

139
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:41,691
No, Tru has to be rendered powerless.

140
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:44,003
And I have an idea
on how we can do that.

141
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:51,048
- Who's the victim?
- Thomas Burrell, M.D.

142
00:08:51,213 --> 00:08:53,966
Must be a psychiatrist.
His office is at...

143
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,488
...87 Third Street.
- I'm going straight there.

144
00:08:56,653 --> 00:08:59,213
Maybe I can head him off
before he goes to the market.

145
00:09:07,373 --> 00:09:09,443
Hey. I'm sorry to bother you...

146
00:09:09,653 --> 00:09:11,564
...but your receptionist
seems to be away.

147
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:12,722
Oh. Um...

148
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:14,969
Well, I'm sure she'll be back
in a minute.

149
00:09:15,813 --> 00:09:18,122
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

150
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:22,002
L... I've been going through
a lot of changes lately...

151
00:09:22,173 --> 00:09:25,404
...and I was thinking maybe it's time
to talk to someone about them.

152
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:28,645
- Could you be more specific, Mr...?
- Goodwin.

153
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:30,724
- Paul Goodwin.
- Dr. Burrell.

154
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:32,929
What do you hope to get
out of therapy, Paul?

155
00:09:33,093 --> 00:09:35,891
Well, I have
a very high-stress job...

156
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:38,362
...and I wouldn't mind learning
some coping skills.

157
00:09:38,573 --> 00:09:40,450
May I ask what it is you do?

158
00:09:40,653 --> 00:09:43,213
You might say I'm a repo man.

159
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:46,206
People cheat, try to hold on
to what's no longer theirs...

160
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:49,365
...and when that happens,
I come and take it back.

161
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:51,763
Well, I can see
where that might be stressful.

162
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:53,924
People must get angry with you
all the time.

163
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:57,728
They do. They fail to realize
that what I do isn't personal.

164
00:09:57,893 --> 00:09:59,565
Laws are there for a reason.

165
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,883
- Someone has to say no.
- Mm-hm.

166
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:05,204
Well, Tuesday at 5 for a beginning?

167
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:06,846
- Great.
- Good.

169
00:10:08,613 --> 00:10:12,367
Excuse me. I'll be right back.
I don't know where Jan's gone.

170
00:10:15,373 --> 00:10:18,012
This is Dr. Burrell. May I help you?

171
00:10:18,173 --> 00:10:21,131
I see. And who made the referral?

172
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:24,244
Thanks, I'm ready.

173
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:26,810
No. That shouldn't be a problem at all.

174
00:10:27,013 --> 00:10:29,049
I'll just lighten my caseload.

175
00:10:34,813 --> 00:10:37,691
No, I tell you what.
Well, Jan's out of the office right now.

176
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:40,925
When she gets back I'll just get her
to move some things around.

177
00:10:41,093 --> 00:10:43,163
No. No problem. You're welcome.

178
00:10:43,613 --> 00:10:47,003
Hi. You know what, I gotta run.
Tuesday at 5, right?

179
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:49,812
- That'll be fine.
- Great.

180
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:53,852
I should mention, I've got an ex-girlfriend
who's just a little <i>Fatal Attraction</i>.

181
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,613
She cornered my last shrink
with a lot of questions.

182
00:10:56,813 --> 00:10:59,281
Claimed the doctor
was in some sort of "danger."

183
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,923
She was trying to invade my privacy,
you know?

184
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:05,523
No, I promise you, I take doctor-patient
confidentiality very seriously.

185
00:11:05,853 --> 00:11:07,923
I figured that. Thanks, doc.

186
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:09,486
See you Tuesday.

187
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:18,690
Dr. Burrell.

188
00:11:22,893 --> 00:11:26,363
Oh, you're too late.
The good doctor just left.

189
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:28,091
How do you know these things?

190
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:30,084
How do you get to a victim
before I do?

191
00:11:30,653 --> 00:11:32,371
Does Apple tell Microsoft?

192
00:11:32,573 --> 00:11:35,485
We're not business rivals.
This is about people's lives, Jack.

193
00:11:35,693 --> 00:11:37,411
Our business is people's lives, Tru.

194
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:40,122
I'm not gonna stand here
arguing with you...

195
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:41,772
...because I've got a job to do.

196
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:43,207
Love the perfume.

197
00:11:44,013 --> 00:11:45,969
See you.

198
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:36,003
- Dr. Burrell.
- Yes?

199
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,169
I need to talk to you.
It's an emergency.

200
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,289
- Would you mind coming with me?
- Coming where?

201
00:12:40,453 --> 00:12:42,728
I can't talk here,
but it'll only take a minute.

202
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:45,401
If you wanna talk,
make an appointment with my office.

203
00:12:45,613 --> 00:12:47,490
No, there isn't time.

204
00:12:47,693 --> 00:12:49,649
Dr. Burrell.

205
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,809
Dr. Burrell.

206
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:54,402
- Police!
- My God!

207
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,006
She killed that man!

208
00:12:56,453 --> 00:12:58,091
No, I...

209
00:12:58,853 --> 00:13:01,970
Hands in the air. You're under arrest.

210
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:16,892
I didn't do it. Someone shot him,
and they're getting away.

211
00:13:17,053 --> 00:13:19,169
They were arguing.
She shot him when he turned.

212
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,642
- It did look like that.
- I was only talking to him.

213
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:24,202
- Ma'am, your name would be?
- Kelly Robson.

216
00:13:45,093 --> 00:13:46,526
Tru, what's the deal?

217
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:49,969
I thought you were supposed to be
the responsible one.

218
00:13:50,173 --> 00:13:51,447
Handcuffs?

219
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:56,608
No problem. I see this all the time.

220
00:13:56,813 --> 00:13:59,964
If you're in this predicament again,
a good penknife will get you out.

221
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:01,965
I don't usually carry a penknife.

222
00:14:02,693 --> 00:14:04,729
Well, any sharp blade will do.

223
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:07,169
How many times
have you been in these?

224
00:14:07,373 --> 00:14:09,170
You know what? Don't answer that.

225
00:14:09,893 --> 00:14:11,804
What's that smell?

226
00:14:15,093 --> 00:14:16,367
- Hi.
- I'm in trouble.

227
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:18,967
I tried to stop the murder,
but things didn't go well.

228
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:21,408
- <i>I need to see you.</i>
- I would advise against that.

229
00:14:21,853 --> 00:14:23,650
Are there, by any chance, cops there?

230
00:14:23,893 --> 00:14:25,770
That would be correct.

231
00:14:26,093 --> 00:14:28,402
I'm sorry that we won't
be seeing each other today.

232
00:14:28,613 --> 00:14:30,285
I got to him too late. Jack was there.

234
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,404
He set me up.
It all happened so quickly.

235
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:37,212
I was standing there
listening to him lie to the police...

236
00:14:37,373 --> 00:14:38,647
...so I got out of Dodge.

237
00:14:38,813 --> 00:14:43,489
Sometimes situations like this
can have a legal solution.

238
00:14:44,253 --> 00:14:47,882
- You want me to turn myself in?
- No.

239
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:51,725
I think he wants me to talk to Dad.

240
00:14:52,053 --> 00:14:53,691
Well, he's got a point, Tru.

241
00:14:53,853 --> 00:14:55,571
Dad's a criminal-defense lawyer.

242
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:58,201
I mean, this is what he does.

243
00:14:58,373 --> 00:15:01,524
Okay, message received.
I'd better go. Call you later.

244
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:03,132
- Okay.
- Who was that?

245
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:06,683
That was my contractor.
He's working on my bathroom...

246
00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:09,088
...and he said
he'd have it ready today, but...

247
00:15:09,253 --> 00:15:11,164
They never show up.

248
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:24,365
- Dad, something happened.
- I know. The police were here.

249
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:26,444
Come sit with me.

250
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:33,126
Honey, you're gonna
have to tell me everything.

251
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,801
- Son, would you mind waiting outside?
- No, it's okay.

252
00:15:36,013 --> 00:15:37,685
Harrison, please.

253
00:15:40,813 --> 00:15:42,246
Sure. Yeah. Outside.

254
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:50,088
Dad, this is all a setup. I didn't do it.

255
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:53,450
You should know that the police
have already begun investigating you.

256
00:15:53,613 --> 00:15:56,207
They found your name
in his appointment book for therapy.

257
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,887
- They know you were his patient.
- I wasn't his patient.

258
00:15:59,053 --> 00:16:02,170
They also found a file
with your name on it in his office.

259
00:16:02,453 --> 00:16:04,728
I never even met this man
before he was killed.

260
00:16:05,093 --> 00:16:07,288
A number of witnesses say
they saw you having...

261
00:16:07,453 --> 00:16:10,013
...an argument with this man.
What was that about?

262
00:16:10,213 --> 00:16:13,205
I never had a gun when I was arrested.
Does that mean anything?

263
00:16:13,413 --> 00:16:15,449
Prosecutions go ahead
without the weapon.

264
00:16:15,653 --> 00:16:18,645
A place that crowded, people tramping
through the crime scene...

265
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,572
...anybody could've kicked it,
anyone could've picked it up.

266
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:25,089
The police will not see that as significant
because they have a witness.

267
00:16:25,253 --> 00:16:28,325
This witness is the man that framed me.
His name is Jack Harper.

268
00:16:28,493 --> 00:16:30,290
He's looking for a way
to bring me down.

269
00:16:30,453 --> 00:16:31,727
Why would he wanna do that?

270
00:16:32,293 --> 00:16:35,046
Because we have this past, Dad.

271
00:16:35,213 --> 00:16:36,646
It's complicated.

272
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:41,813
Dad, why did you ask Harrison
to step outside?

273
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:44,693
Because I thought you might have
something to tell me...

274
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:46,605
...that you wouldn't want him to hear.

275
00:16:50,573 --> 00:16:51,926
I have to go.

276
00:16:52,253 --> 00:16:53,811
Tru.

277
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,609
- He thinks I'm guilty.
- No. You just misunderstood him.

278
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,606
Harry, he believes that I killed someone,
that I'm a murderer.

279
00:17:06,773 --> 00:17:09,082
He must've had his mind made up
before I got there.

280
00:17:09,253 --> 00:17:12,006
I was stupid to expect
that just because he's my father...

281
00:17:12,173 --> 00:17:13,731
I'm on my own in this.

282
00:17:13,893 --> 00:17:16,965
No. Look, you are not
on your own, okay?

283
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:18,646
You got me.

284
00:17:18,813 --> 00:17:22,249
I'm not some hotshot lawyer, okay?
But I know people.

285
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:25,689
I know a guy who can get us
some fake IDs, passports.

286
00:17:25,893 --> 00:17:28,805
We can go to Mexico, Thailand. Really.

287
00:17:29,373 --> 00:17:30,692
I'll find a job.

288
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:33,208
You could look for an opening
at a morgue.

289
00:17:33,373 --> 00:17:35,443
There's dead people
all over the world, right?

290
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:38,965
I don't think it'll work, but thank you.

291
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:41,847
Come on, let's go.

292
00:17:42,493 --> 00:17:46,088
- Good job.
- It is the humanitarian approach.

293
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:49,404
What harm could she do behind bars
for the next 50 years?

294
00:17:49,573 --> 00:17:53,452
Okay, so she could save a few felons,
I'll give her that.

295
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:56,322
Did you know that when
the guillotine was invented...

296
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,768
...the idea came from a physician?

297
00:18:00,493 --> 00:18:01,812
Dr. Guillotin.

298
00:18:02,813 --> 00:18:06,203
He thought that was humanitarian too.

299
00:18:06,373 --> 00:18:08,011
Well, it was quick.

300
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:10,962
You sure you can talk?

301
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,442
- You okay?
<i>- Usually, if the day were this bad...</i>

302
00:18:13,653 --> 00:18:16,087
...I'd do it over,
except I'm doing it over already.

303
00:18:16,293 --> 00:18:18,170
Burrell's body got here a half-hour ago.

304
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:20,609
Okay, you'll find a piece of paper
on the body.

305
00:18:20,773 --> 00:18:23,845
And there's a note scribbled.
"Varden" and "DSM3."

306
00:18:24,013 --> 00:18:26,891
You knew he was a psychiatrist
from what you found on the body.

307
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:29,248
- How's that possible?
- It must be the DSM3.

308
00:18:29,413 --> 00:18:32,450
That's the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical</i>
<i>Manual of Disorders.</i>

309
00:18:32,773 --> 00:18:35,526
It's kind of the bible
of psychiatric diagnosis.

310
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:39,522
It's weird, though, because the third
edition was replaced by number four...

311
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:40,967
...back in the '90s.

312
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:44,090
Is any of this helping you, or...?

313
00:18:44,293 --> 00:18:45,567
I wish I could say it was.

314
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:48,201
Because I have this crazy idea, I guess.

315
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:49,892
Right now, I'm so open.

316
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:52,527
Well, if you can get in contact
with Burrell's body...

317
00:18:52,693 --> 00:18:54,206
...he might ask for help again.

318
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:57,285
And that way your day could restart,
and you can get yourself...

319
00:18:57,453 --> 00:19:01,446
...out of this mess. It's a long shot,
but it may be the only shot we have.

320
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:05,450
The problem is that there's still
way too many police here.

321
00:19:05,653 --> 00:19:08,372
If I can't get to the body,
maybe you could bring it to me.

322
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:11,491
Well, I find that cadavers
tend to get noticed in public.

323
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:13,490
I know one place
where they're old news.

324
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,372
The anatomy lab on campus.
It should be empty right now.

325
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:18,245
- <i>I'll meet you there</i>.
- Okay.

326
00:19:18,453 --> 00:19:22,082
Yeah, and fleeing to Thailand
was a crazy idea.

327
00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:25,484
Look, I can do this on my own,
but they'll be searching for my car.

328
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:27,689
Lend me yours?

329
00:19:27,853 --> 00:19:29,127
I'm driving.

330
00:19:41,853 --> 00:19:43,411
Hey.

331
00:19:44,293 --> 00:19:47,046
So some alone time
with Mr. Gorenstein?

332
00:19:47,213 --> 00:19:50,364
Yeah, I'm just reviewing
this morning's work. What about you?

333
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:54,003
- Me? Same thing.
- Well, pull up a stool.

334
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:58,291
Wouldn't you rather pull up a stool
at the coffee shop, say?

335
00:19:59,253 --> 00:20:03,132
- Are you asking me out for coffee?
- No, I'm just confused is all.

336
00:20:03,293 --> 00:20:06,683
I mean, you seem like the last person
in our class who'd need to review.

337
00:20:06,853 --> 00:20:08,127
I mean, you're brilliant.

338
00:20:08,293 --> 00:20:12,252
You graduated college early,
masters in chemistry.

339
00:20:12,413 --> 00:20:15,325
Teachers are already impressed with you,
so take a break.

340
00:20:15,493 --> 00:20:18,053
Did Avery tell you that
in the two minutes it took me...

341
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:19,646
...to get sponges this morning?

342
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:21,405
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

343
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:24,252
It's not the professors
I really need to convince.

344
00:20:24,413 --> 00:20:25,892
Heard of the Bettendorf Clinic?

345
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:28,323
Right up there with Mayo
and Johns Hopkins.

346
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:31,206
My dad's kind of their poster child.

347
00:20:31,373 --> 00:20:34,410
Some people say he's
the top diagnostician in the country.

348
00:20:34,573 --> 00:20:36,450
- Hard to live up to.
- Yeah.

349
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:40,162
No, besides from
the inhumanly high standards...

350
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,403
...he's kind of like Martha Stewart,
you know?

351
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:44,564
And I just keep
folding the napkins wrong.

352
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:47,605
I know what you mean.

353
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,849
Yeah, I never know
what my dad's gonna be.

354
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:54,892
Which is why there's no point
in being here on a nice day...

355
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,532
...trying to impress these guys.

356
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:02,122
Um...

357
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,766
Tru?

358
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:06,608
Look, I'm in trouble,
and I can't explain why...

359
00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:09,452
...but I need you to trust me.
Don't tell anyone I'm here.

360
00:21:09,613 --> 00:21:10,887
What are you doing? Tru?

361
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:13,965
Tru, is there something
I should know here? Tru?

362
00:21:19,573 --> 00:21:21,564
I'm Officer Gomez.

363
00:21:21,773 --> 00:21:24,765
Maybe you can help me.
I'm looking for a Tru Davies.

364
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:38,731
I understand Miss Davies
audits class in here?

365
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:41,731
Yeah, in the morning she does,
but it's over now.

366
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:45,130
- So you're acquainted with her?
- Yeah, she's a medical student.

367
00:21:45,293 --> 00:21:48,365
She's in my anatomy class.

368
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:51,004
What can you tell me?

369
00:21:53,093 --> 00:21:54,367
Um...

370
00:21:54,693 --> 00:21:57,605
May I ask why it is
that you're looking for her?

371
00:21:57,773 --> 00:22:00,082
She's wanted for questioning
in regard to a murder.

372
00:22:00,693 --> 00:22:02,604
Oh, so you're looking for her
as a witness?

373
00:22:02,813 --> 00:22:04,451
We'd just like to speak with her.

375
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:10,530
What's that smell?

376
00:22:12,053 --> 00:22:15,409
Oh, that's perfume. I dropped a bottle.
It was a gift for my girlfriend.

377
00:22:17,493 --> 00:22:20,246
- What do you think?
- I think it's a little strong.

378
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:36,570
Why should I have to
fork over my hard-earned taxes?

379
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:50,765
Excuse me?

380
00:22:51,853 --> 00:22:53,286
Hey, can I help you?

381
00:22:53,813 --> 00:22:55,212
You mind if we check that?

382
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:05,928
Wait right here.

384
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,005
Gomez here.

385
00:23:15,133 --> 00:23:17,249
He did?

386
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:19,683
No. I wanna question him myself.

387
00:23:19,893 --> 00:23:21,849
Make sure he doesn't leave.

388
00:23:22,013 --> 00:23:23,890
I have to go.

389
00:23:24,493 --> 00:23:28,042
Here's my card. You can reach me
at that number any time.

391
00:23:34,853 --> 00:23:37,970
Was there something
you wanted to tell me?

392
00:23:40,053 --> 00:23:41,850
Just if I hear anything, I'll call you.

393
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:50,046
Tru, what the hell is going on?

394
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:54,164
Thank you. Just thank you.

395
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,732
You did the right thing.

396
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,532
Hopefully, I'll be able
to explain this to you someday...

397
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:00,644
...or that I won't have to.

398
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:02,332
Tru, what are you...?

399
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:17,283
Thanks, officer. Mr. Davis.

400
00:24:17,493 --> 00:24:18,892
It's actually just Davis.

401
00:24:19,093 --> 00:24:20,685
Why don't we have a little chat.

403
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:26,883
Tru. Tru, you gotta get back
to the car.

404
00:24:27,053 --> 00:24:30,125
The cops are looking for you.
You can't stay in one place too long.

405
00:24:30,293 --> 00:24:32,932
Where the hell's Davis?
He didn't show up with the body...

406
00:24:33,093 --> 00:24:34,731
...and he's not answering the phone.

408
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,052
May I?

409
00:25:00,893 --> 00:25:02,167
Davis, what's going on?

410
00:25:02,373 --> 00:25:04,045
It's Detective Gomez, Miss Davies.

411
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,813
<i>Guess what. You're number one</i>
<i>on your boss 's speed dial.</i>

412
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:08,964
<i>You need to think</i>
<i>about turning yourself in.</i>

413
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:13,012
You're an intelligent woman. You're only
getting yourself deeper in trouble.

414
00:25:13,213 --> 00:25:15,568
- And now your friends too.
- Triangulating.

415
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:18,088
Detective, I didn't kill that man.

416
00:25:18,253 --> 00:25:19,322
Hang up the phone.

417
00:25:19,533 --> 00:25:22,206
- That man was a good human being.
- Tru.

418
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:23,806
I was meeting him
because he told me about you.

419
00:25:24,013 --> 00:25:26,527
- What?
- He wanted to discuss a patient.

420
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,371
I was never his patient.

421
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:30,330
Tru, they can trace the call.

422
00:25:30,533 --> 00:25:32,091
It's down to a 12-block radius.

423
00:25:32,293 --> 00:25:34,682
Your name was in his book,
you were seen with him...

424
00:25:34,853 --> 00:25:36,923
...and you wanna tell me
you didn't know him?

425
00:25:37,573 --> 00:25:39,768
Do yourself a favor and surrender.

426
00:25:39,933 --> 00:25:42,322
Let your lawyer do the talking.

427
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:51,005
Give me that. Look, you keep this.
I got a work phone in the car.

428
00:25:51,173 --> 00:25:53,812
- What are you gonna do with mine?
- I'm gonna drive away...

429
00:25:53,973 --> 00:25:56,168
...make a call and throw it in a truck.

430
00:25:56,853 --> 00:25:59,811
If there's one thing I know, it's sneaky.
What about you?

431
00:26:00,013 --> 00:26:01,924
Davis got busted
so there's no rewind.

432
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:04,010
All I've got is a note from the doctor.

433
00:26:04,213 --> 00:26:05,931
Varden and DSM3.

434
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:08,283
- So?
- Okay.

435
00:26:08,453 --> 00:26:12,446
Can you do one more sneaky thing
for me before you go?

436
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,411
I need you to steal a book
from the medical library.

437
00:26:16,813 --> 00:26:18,531
No problem.

438
00:26:21,173 --> 00:26:22,970
Stay here, keep an eye on our friend.

439
00:26:23,173 --> 00:26:26,643
Watch in case Miss Davies returns.
You never know.

440
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:32,207
Detective, as I've told you, I was taking
Dr. Burrell's body to the security crypt.

441
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:35,012
Generally, that is where we keep
high-profile cases.

442
00:26:35,213 --> 00:26:37,124
I thought it was a good idea
at the time...

443
00:26:37,293 --> 00:26:40,046
...because the suspect
was a morgue employee.

444
00:26:40,213 --> 00:26:42,283
And, yes, Miss Davies
is on my speed dial.

445
00:26:42,453 --> 00:26:45,411
But so is Funky Chicken
and Charmed Pizza...

446
00:26:45,613 --> 00:26:47,968
...as well as
three other morgue workers.

447
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:49,686
Now, you've got your body.

448
00:26:49,853 --> 00:26:52,242
I have a morgue to run.

449
00:26:53,773 --> 00:26:55,047
Excuse me.

450
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:14,043
Thank you so much, Harry.
I really appreciate it.

451
00:27:15,173 --> 00:27:16,447
And a little bonus for you.

452
00:27:19,453 --> 00:27:21,364
Tru, you watch yourself.

453
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:25,369
They're handing these out to everyone
who passes the Union, okay?

454
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:29,292
Thanks.

455
00:27:32,853 --> 00:27:35,128
Hi. Do you mind if I join you?

456
00:27:35,293 --> 00:27:36,692
No, go right ahead.

457
00:27:39,973 --> 00:27:42,407
Oh, damn. I forgot to ask for sugar.

458
00:27:42,573 --> 00:27:45,292
I wanted to discuss
patient-therapist confidentiality.

459
00:27:46,293 --> 00:27:47,282
Oh.

460
00:27:47,453 --> 00:27:49,842
Davis, as a psychologist,
I'm employed by the city...

461
00:27:50,013 --> 00:27:53,562
...but I respect anything you might
have shared during your evaluation.

462
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:56,441
Oh, I'm being hypothetical.

463
00:27:56,613 --> 00:27:58,331
I'm writing a book.

464
00:27:58,693 --> 00:28:01,161
Are you really? Wow.

465
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:04,923
Hands-on professional and a man
of words, all in one package.

466
00:28:05,093 --> 00:28:08,165
Tell me you can do laundry
and we'll run away together.

467
00:28:08,373 --> 00:28:12,446
Under what circumstances is it ethical
to discuss a patient with the police?

468
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,405
The laws vary from state to state...

469
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:16,768
...but basically,
when there's immediate threat.

470
00:28:16,973 --> 00:28:19,328
Knowledge of a past crime
wouldn't be enough?

471
00:28:19,493 --> 00:28:22,530
Only if it contributes to your belief
that there's a threat.

472
00:28:22,973 --> 00:28:25,407
And past crime can help predict
future behavior.

473
00:28:26,133 --> 00:28:29,011
You are a man
of many surprises, Davis.

474
00:28:30,253 --> 00:28:33,404
- What's the book about?
- Hmm?

476
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,162
- Hello?
- It's me.

477
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,607
Harrison gave me your number.

478
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:41,651
He said something about putting
your phone in the back of a truck?

479
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:45,323
Oh, God, Davis, it's so good to hear
your voice. Are you all right?

480
00:28:45,493 --> 00:28:48,803
I'm fine, don't worry about me.
Did you find anything about the note?

481
00:28:49,013 --> 00:28:50,526
No. And the word's spreading.

482
00:28:50,693 --> 00:28:52,445
I don't know how much time
I have left.

483
00:28:52,653 --> 00:28:54,405
We still don't know what Varden means.

484
00:28:54,573 --> 00:28:57,963
<i>But if it is the killer's name,</i>
<i>and he is a patient...</i>

485
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:00,044
<i>... he probably will be in Burrell's files.</i>

486
00:29:00,213 --> 00:29:02,647
I thought of that.
But breaking into the man's office?

487
00:29:02,813 --> 00:29:05,168
That's risky,
and the police could still be there.

488
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:08,166
And if Varden's not in the files,
then it was all for nothing.

489
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,528
Not necessarily.
I've been speaking with Carrie.

490
00:29:10,693 --> 00:29:12,923
Search for someone the doctor
would assume...

491
00:29:13,093 --> 00:29:16,051
<i>... would present a danger.</i>
<i>Someone with a violent background</i>.

492
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,408
I can't sit there all night
going through files.

493
00:29:18,613 --> 00:29:21,889
- You're right.
- We'll hope the right one is near the top.

494
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,881
There's one more thing. Unless you have
a background as a jewel thief...

495
00:29:26,053 --> 00:29:29,443
...I don't know about, I don't see you
just waltzing into a locked office.

496
00:29:29,653 --> 00:29:32,690
Does the morgue still have
Burrell's personal effects?

497
00:29:32,853 --> 00:29:36,004
- I see where you're going with this.
- Talk to you later.

498
00:29:45,173 --> 00:29:47,368
I'll be right there.

499
00:29:47,573 --> 00:29:49,848
Hey. Messenger.

500
00:29:50,013 --> 00:29:53,085
- Package going to County Records?
- Make sure it gets there quickly.

501
00:29:53,733 --> 00:29:56,008
Trust me, I got it.

502
00:30:17,893 --> 00:30:19,804
You really came through today, Harry.

503
00:30:19,973 --> 00:30:21,804
I'm good with emergencies.

504
00:30:21,973 --> 00:30:25,648
It's that day-to-day stuff I can't hack.

505
00:30:26,893 --> 00:30:29,088
Yesterday you were at a hockey game
right now...

506
00:30:29,253 --> 00:30:31,767
...taking those pictures you wanted
for Dad. I'm sorry.

507
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:35,005
This is more important.
We stick together, sis.

508
00:30:35,173 --> 00:30:38,290
And that way, Dad can be disappointed
in both of us.

509
00:30:41,293 --> 00:30:44,490
Okay. Well, just get out of here.

510
00:30:44,653 --> 00:30:50,330
I got my work phone. If any cops even
think about showing up, I'll call you.

512
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:21,602
Tru? Tru?

513
00:31:21,773 --> 00:31:23,491
Harrison.

514
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:40,323
Varden. Varden.

515
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:15,005
"Donald Stuart Mitchell III."

516
00:32:15,173 --> 00:32:17,368
DSM3.

517
00:32:21,093 --> 00:32:24,768
"Violent tendencies.
Narcissistic personality.

518
00:32:24,973 --> 00:32:27,248
Sense of entitlement.
Possible involvement...

519
00:32:27,453 --> 00:32:29,921
...in the disappearance
of girlfriend, Grace Varden."

520
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:33,766
Looks like my tip was right.

521
00:32:34,573 --> 00:32:38,248
Detective, listen to me. I'm holding
the killer's file in my hands right now.

522
00:32:38,453 --> 00:32:40,364
Donald Stuart Mitchell.

523
00:32:40,573 --> 00:32:43,770
He's the patient Dr. Burrell wanted
to talk to you about.

524
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:46,845
He must've found out
what the doctor was gonna do.

525
00:32:47,253 --> 00:32:48,527
Oh, my God.

526
00:32:48,693 --> 00:32:51,571
If he was at the market early enough
and saw you two talking...

527
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:53,007
...he'll wanna kill you too.

528
00:32:53,173 --> 00:32:55,846
Put the folder down.
You're not doing yourself any good.

529
00:32:56,173 --> 00:32:58,448
Listen to me.
He'll wanna kill you too...

530
00:32:58,613 --> 00:33:00,968
...if he thinks you know
he killed Grace Varden.

531
00:33:01,173 --> 00:33:02,572
Grace Varden?

533
00:33:14,053 --> 00:33:17,762
Thanks. I think that file's mine.

534
00:33:19,813 --> 00:33:23,408
- Relax, I'm not gonna kill you.
- No.

535
00:33:23,573 --> 00:33:26,565
Because the police would only look
for another shooter.

536
00:33:26,733 --> 00:33:29,850
This way I'm the end of the trail.
I go to prison for two murders.

537
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:33,483
- And one a cop-killing.
- I'll tell them the truth.

538
00:33:33,773 --> 00:33:35,764
Feel free to tell them
whatever you want.

539
00:33:36,613 --> 00:33:39,286
Because without this file,
it becomes a story you made up.

540
00:33:41,213 --> 00:33:45,445
It's too bad the circumstances
aren't a little different.

541
00:33:47,933 --> 00:33:54,008
Because you are a lot prettier
than Grace was.

542
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:12,289
Jack. He decked me.

543
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:23,650
Sorry, Harry.

544
00:34:27,053 --> 00:34:29,044
There's nothing left to do.

545
00:34:30,173 --> 00:34:32,084
Help me.

546
00:34:38,213 --> 00:34:41,205
That's no way to handle
a gallbladder, Mr. Lee.

547
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:51,204
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

548
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,688
Thank you. Really.

549
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:08,931
But I really have to go.

550
00:35:11,973 --> 00:35:14,487
Why are you taking that?

551
00:35:14,653 --> 00:35:15,927
I don't have a penknife.

552
00:35:18,213 --> 00:35:21,683
Is it me, or does Tru seem
a little abrupt?

553
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:26,044
- Day three?
- And two lives to save.

554
00:35:26,253 --> 00:35:28,164
What I can find is that
Grace was a coed...

555
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:31,769
...who disappeared three years ago.
The cops think she was a murder victim.

556
00:35:31,933 --> 00:35:35,721
But there's no evidence of what became
of her. They never found her body.

557
00:35:35,893 --> 00:35:39,522
And her family is devastated, but they
have no idea what happened to her.

558
00:35:39,733 --> 00:35:41,883
I have to make another call. Are you clear
on what I need you to do?

559
00:35:42,093 --> 00:35:44,368
- Got it.
- Okay.

561
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:49,125
Hey, sis.

562
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:51,648
I'm on my first solo gig for Dad.

563
00:35:51,853 --> 00:35:53,525
No time. It's a rewind day. Listen.

564
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:56,805
Yesterday, I was arrested for murder.
You got decked by Jack.

565
00:35:57,013 --> 00:35:58,571
- I was what?
- <i>Never mind.</i>

566
00:35:58,773 --> 00:36:02,322
Today, I'm gonna do things differently.
Jack's gonna do things differently too.

567
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,768
He'll throw a curve ball
where we least expect it.

568
00:36:04,973 --> 00:36:06,406
<i>Here's what I need you to do.</i>

569
00:36:27,733 --> 00:36:30,372
Dr. Burrell. You're here to meet
Detective Gomez.

570
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:33,366
Yes. Couldn't she make it?
Are you with the police?

571
00:36:36,573 --> 00:36:39,531
You're in immediate danger
from one of your patients.

572
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:42,167
Donald Stuart Mitchell.
We think he's here.

573
00:36:42,373 --> 00:36:45,683
If you'll go with this man,
he'll take you somewhere safe.

574
00:36:47,453 --> 00:36:48,772
Thank you.

575
00:37:01,813 --> 00:37:03,963
That was for yesterday.

576
00:37:04,453 --> 00:37:05,727
I think.

577
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:11,371
Harrison, Harrison, get out of the way.
Your sister's in danger.

578
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:14,570
Whoa. Right. Coming from you?
I don't think so.

579
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:16,572
You got two targets today.

580
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:18,564
You're trying to make sure
that cop dies.

581
00:37:18,733 --> 00:37:20,803
The killer thinks your sister is the cop.

582
00:37:21,013 --> 00:37:23,208
Don't you see?
He saw her talking to the doctor.

583
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:25,489
Your sister is the target.

584
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:30,731
- Wouldn't that make you happy?
- No. Tru didn't die yesterday.

585
00:37:30,893 --> 00:37:34,203
She's not supposed to die today.
Whatever you think of me, I don't care.

586
00:37:34,413 --> 00:37:36,927
But do you wanna take a chance
with your sister's life?

587
00:37:57,213 --> 00:37:59,283
- What are you doing?
- I'm saving your life.

588
00:37:59,453 --> 00:38:01,091
Officer! Help!

589
00:38:01,533 --> 00:38:03,569
Police. Nobody move.

590
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:06,645
- Jack.
- Watch this. The detective's all mine.

591
00:38:06,853 --> 00:38:10,163
Hey, that's Detective Gomez.
She's the one you want.

592
00:38:15,933 --> 00:38:17,924
Drop it.

593
00:38:27,133 --> 00:38:29,852
You're under arrest
for the murder of Grace Varden.

594
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:48,849
I have a feeling Grace Varden's family
will finally be getting some closure.

595
00:38:49,013 --> 00:38:50,571
Thank you.

596
00:38:52,733 --> 00:38:54,928
Bye.

597
00:38:56,613 --> 00:38:59,252
Well, it's been...

598
00:38:59,413 --> 00:39:01,802
Well, it's been confusing as usual.

599
00:39:02,653 --> 00:39:04,530
I gotta get out of here.
I got a job to do.

600
00:39:04,693 --> 00:39:06,923
Those incriminating photos
don't take themselves.

601
00:39:07,093 --> 00:39:08,446
Enjoy the hockey game.

602
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:10,729
And watch out
for a sudden right hook.

603
00:39:12,173 --> 00:39:14,812
I never thought I'd know
anybody that was on the lam.

604
00:39:14,973 --> 00:39:16,611
Yeah, it's more fun in the movies...

605
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:18,889
...when you're with Cary Grant
or Matt Damon.

606
00:39:19,053 --> 00:39:21,328
Yeah. Well, you just had
Harrison and me.

607
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:22,767
Oh, Davis, please.

608
00:39:22,933 --> 00:39:25,572
You guys were the best accomplices
a girl could want.

609
00:39:26,173 --> 00:39:28,528
- Hey, Davis.
- Oh, hi.

610
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:32,408
I'm so absent-minded, I was in the
elevator when I realized I forgot sugar.

611
00:39:32,573 --> 00:39:34,052
Oh, here.

612
00:39:34,893 --> 00:39:37,088
- Thanks.
- Sure.

613
00:39:39,653 --> 00:39:42,486
- Hi. Tru.
- Hi. Carrie. I've seen you around.

614
00:39:45,493 --> 00:39:49,281
So seen any good cadavers lately?

615
00:39:49,933 --> 00:39:51,082
Uh...

616
00:39:51,253 --> 00:39:55,292
Yeah, actually I have. This guy came in
and his entire intestinal system was...

617
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:56,972
- It was orange.
- She was kidding.

618
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,247
I... I was too. It's, like...

619
00:40:01,413 --> 00:40:02,971
...joking around and stuff.

620
00:40:04,413 --> 00:40:07,325
- I should get back. Bye.
- See you.

621
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:10,491
- Bye.
- Enjoy the sugar.

622
00:40:13,493 --> 00:40:15,449
Enjoy the sugar. God.

623
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,968
My complete ineptitude. Jeez.

624
00:40:18,173 --> 00:40:20,767
- You like her.
- No, I don't.

625
00:40:22,493 --> 00:40:24,131
Yeah, maybe. I don't know.

626
00:40:24,293 --> 00:40:26,363
- Is there a day one for this?
- Didn't go well.

627
00:40:26,533 --> 00:40:29,093
- Day two?
- Don't know. I was too busy to talk.

628
00:40:29,253 --> 00:40:31,813
It probably didn't go very well.

629
00:40:32,573 --> 00:40:35,883
There's some kind
of weird connection I have, though.

630
00:40:36,053 --> 00:40:37,964
I'm probably full of myself.

631
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:40,124
Well, as a henchman
in my underworld gang...

632
00:40:40,293 --> 00:40:43,091
...you were the best.

633
00:40:51,853 --> 00:40:53,969
I don't know what happened
to etiquette.

634
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:59,003
It's been a week.
You don't call, you don't write.

635
00:40:59,173 --> 00:41:02,210
Don't people still say thanks
when someone saves their lives?

636
00:41:02,373 --> 00:41:05,570
I would thank you if you hadn't been
setting up Detective Gomez...

637
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:07,132
...to die at the same time.

638
00:41:07,693 --> 00:41:09,684
Then there's that
"framing for murder" part.

639
00:41:09,893 --> 00:41:11,565
You take things too personally, Tru.

640
00:41:12,213 --> 00:41:15,649
A word of advice:
This med school thing is a nice dream.

641
00:41:15,813 --> 00:41:17,485
But you can't have both worlds.

642
00:41:18,413 --> 00:41:21,291
As long as you do what you do,
you don't belong in there.

643
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:25,566
My advice to you:
Work on being a gracious loser.

644
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:37,013
Tru can tell you I was right
about the metatarsals.

645
00:41:37,173 --> 00:41:39,289
- You're not.
- She's right about the metatarsals.

646
00:41:39,453 --> 00:41:42,604
It's gonna be like that
for the rest of the year?

647
00:41:42,773 --> 00:41:46,129
You two ganging up?
It's not fun.

648
00:41:46,293 --> 00:41:48,284
He knows I was right.
