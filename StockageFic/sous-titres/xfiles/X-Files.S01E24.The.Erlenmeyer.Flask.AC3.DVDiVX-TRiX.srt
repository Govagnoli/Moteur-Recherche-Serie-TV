Rogeryour request for assistance.

00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:19,157
What is your
present location?

3
00:00:19,232 --> 00:00:20,893
Unit 50, go ahead.

4
00:00:20,967 --> 00:00:22,366
Suspect is now
westbound.

5
00:00:22,436 --> 00:00:24,063
Has entered the gate

7
00:00:25,138 --> 00:00:27,402

still in pursuit. Over.

Pull yourvehicle over and stop!

10
00:01:00,907 --> 00:01:03,034

12
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:09,044
Get on the ground!

13
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:10,344
Do it!

14
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:12,209
Did you hear me?

15
00:01:12,285 --> 00:01:13,650
Face down!

16
00:01:13,754 --> 00:01:15,051
Do it!

(Grunting)

19
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:32,097
Stop!

20
00:01:32,172 --> 00:01:33,230
Armed officer!

21
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:35,069
(Gunshots)

22
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:48,748
I hit him.

23
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:50,618
I know I hit him.

24
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:52,521
Where the hell
did he go?

25
00:01:52,592 --> 00:01:55,322
He'd be bleeding bad.

26
00:02:55,355 --> 00:02:56,720
...offthe coast ofltaly.

27
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,553
But theirs is a very
light lava.

28
00:02:58,625 --> 00:02:59,990
That's what stumped me.

29
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,187
Because inside
there must be something

30
00:03:02,262 --> 00:03:04,127
the weight
ofthe heaviest rock.

31
00:03:04,197 --> 00:03:07,166
But, Professor, that would be
lcelandic peridotite.

32
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:08,258
Precisely.

33
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:10,132
There's a piece chipped off.

34
00:03:10,203 --> 00:03:11,261
By me.

35
00:03:11,338 --> 00:03:13,169
Well, what's
the rock inside?

36
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:15,434
Icelandic peridotite,
naturally.

37
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:17,976
When I saw this,
I stopped chipping.

38
00:03:18,044 --> 00:03:20,205
(Phone Rings)

39
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:23,748
Mulder.

40
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:26,809
Areyou watching channel eight?

41
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:28,582
What's your conclusion?

42
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:30,714
Science does not
jump to conclusions.

43
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,485
Science is not
a guessing game.

44
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:35,722
Reporter:
...where a 60-mile
high-speed car chase

45
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:37,592
ended early this evening--

46
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:41,225
the suspect eluding capture
by leaping into the harbor

47
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:44,293
but not before injuring
several Ardis police officers.

48
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:46,999
We have Captain Roy Lacerio
standing by.

49
00:03:47,107 --> 00:03:48,631
How was the man
able to escape

50
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:51,677
and how seriously injured
were the officers involved?

51
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:53,713
Those details
are still unclear.

52
00:03:53,813 --> 00:03:55,610
I'll be talking
with several...

53
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:57,673
I'm sorry--
You'll have to excuse me.

54
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:00,686
Captain Roy Lacerio
being pulled away here

55
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:02,881
during an intense manhunt.

56
00:04:07,394 --> 00:04:09,419
...Lacerio being
pulled away here

57
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:11,123
during an intense...

58
00:04:11,197 --> 00:04:14,792
Mulder, you've been through
this tape 1 00 times.

59
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:17,632
What exactly areyou
hoping to find?

60
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:19,535
Mulder:
I don't know.

61
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,834
And all he told you

62
00:04:21,942 --> 00:04:23,341
was to watch
channel eight?

63
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,275
Yeah, that's all he said.

64
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:27,540
Do we even know
why the suspect

65
00:04:27,614 --> 00:04:29,104
was being chased?

66
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:30,341
As far as I can tell

67
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:33,113
he wouldn't pull over
for a moving violation.

68
00:04:33,186 --> 00:04:34,676
Well, that should put him

69
00:04:34,754 --> 00:04:36,483
on the ten
most wanted list.

70
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:38,217
There must be
something here.

71
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,849
Some detail

72
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:41,120
we're not seeing.

73
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:46,928
How doyou know
he's notjustyanking your chain?

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,195
Well, he has admitted
lying toyou.

75
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:52,761
He wouldn't call
ifthere wasn't something here--

76
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:55,535
something
he wants me to see.

77
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,902
Then what areyou missing?

78
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:02,581
There were three
law enforcement agencies

79
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:04,014
out here last night.

80
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:06,211
Hunting a man
on a moving violation?

81
00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:08,413
I know it's not
Silence OfThe Lambs

82
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:09,819
but it's what we do.

83
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:12,585
This man isn't wearing
a badge or a uniform.

84
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:14,024
He's not one ofyours?

85
00:05:14,094 --> 00:05:15,083
No, sir.

86
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:16,924
But it was
a zoo out here.

87
00:05:16,997 --> 00:05:18,897
You say the suspect
was shot.

88
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:21,832
Why hasn't the body
been recovered?

89
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:23,562
We got our search ongoing.

90
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:26,071
We're quite certain
he will be found.

91
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:28,266
It's been almost 1 8 hours,
Captain.

92
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,865
Where could the body be?

93
00:05:29,976 --> 00:05:32,809
There are cables and debris
all over the bottom.

94
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,437
It's a painstaking business.

95
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:37,482
Can I askwhat the F.B.I.'s
interest in this case

96
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,142
would be?

97
00:05:40,353 --> 00:05:42,344
The suspect matches
the description

98
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:43,650
ofa federal fugitive.

99
00:05:43,723 --> 00:05:44,951
Really? How's that?

100
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:48,017
No description ofthe suspect
has been released.

101
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:51,989
Ifyou don't mind,
can we take a look

102
00:05:52,065 --> 00:05:52,997
at the car, please?

103
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:56,092
It's been taken to impound.

104
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:58,729
The report says that the car
was registered

105
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:00,830
to a rental agency
in Gaithersburg.

106
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,465
They had no idea
the carwas even missing.

107
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:04,941
You know, Mulder

108
00:06:05,011 --> 00:06:07,479
I think that
we're wasting our time here.

109
00:06:07,547 --> 00:06:10,778
I don't know what the hell
I'm supposed to find.

110
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:19,990
You can't make out the license plate
in this photo.

111
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:31,059
Scully, look at this.

112
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:33,967
What?

113
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:39,206
Look at the car
in the photo.

114
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,713
Look at the windshield.

115
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:47,846
It's not the same car.

116
00:06:47,921 --> 00:06:49,582
Scully:
It's called a caduceus.

117
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:51,089
It's the adopted symbol

118
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:52,749
ofthe medical profession.

119
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:55,954
So probably only a doctor
would have that on his car.

120
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:57,087
Mm-hmm.

121
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:58,460
I had the picture enhanced.

122
00:06:58,531 --> 00:06:59,862
The plate is different.

123
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:01,662
"3 A-Y-F."

124
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:03,225
Fast-forward.

125
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:04,964
That's all you can make out.

126
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:06,869
The rest is obscured.

127
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:09,533
Hey, Danny, it's Mulder.

128
00:07:09,642 --> 00:07:12,736
Run a Maryland plate for me.

129
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:14,074
All I got
is a partial.

130
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:16,411
Registered to a doctor,
or used to be.

131
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:18,007
Yeah, I'll hold.

132
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:20,109
They switched cars
and lied about it.

133
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:21,585
Whywould they do that?

134
00:07:21,654 --> 00:07:24,817
Maybe the real owner ofthe car
has something to hide.

00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:38,227

Dr. Berube?

137
00:07:38,304 --> 00:07:39,396
Yes?

138
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:40,769
We're with the F.B.I.

139
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:42,102
Can we have a minute?

140
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,334
I'm very busy.

141
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:45,843
Areyou aware
that a car registered toyou

142
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:47,880
was involved
in a high-speed chase

143
00:07:47,947 --> 00:07:49,073
in Ardis yesterday?

144
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:50,116
Excuse me?

145
00:07:50,216 --> 00:07:51,581
A silver Ciera, Doctor.

146
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:52,845
Doyou own one?

147
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:53,851
Yes.

148
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,319
It was used forwhat?

149
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:56,412
A crime.

150
00:07:56,489 --> 00:07:57,956
Wereyou aware
it was even missing?

151
00:07:58,024 --> 00:07:59,184
Not until now.

152
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:02,717
I have a housekeeper,
and she often uses the car.

153
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:03,785
It's a second car...

154
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:04,727
Please!

155
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:06,197
They should
not be excited.

156
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:08,097
Nothing should be touched.

157
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:09,567
I thought theywere friendly.

158
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:12,764
They're part
ofan experiment.

159
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,328
What kind?

160
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,098
Am I under

161
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:15,868
some kind
ofsuspicion?

162
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:17,943
No.

163
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:20,069
Then I think I've answered
all your questions.

164
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,514
Excuse me.
I have more work than time.

165
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:26,051
Thankyou.

166
00:08:34,994 --> 00:08:35,926
Did he biteyou?

167
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:38,259
No, but he tried to.

168
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:39,593
Well, it's almost 5:00.

169
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,896
Let's check
with the doctor's housekeeper

170
00:08:41,968 --> 00:08:42,992
about the car.

171
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:43,763
No.

172
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:45,702
No? What doyou mean?

173
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:48,263
This has reached
the point ofabsurdity.

174
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:50,171
We're out here on halfa hunch

00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:51,834

that's based on speculation.

177
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:56,782
Well, that's all we've got.

178
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,181
That's all he's given us.

179

Who is this
Deep Throat character?

180
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,050
We don't know anything
about him.

181
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:04,817
He's in a delicate position.

182
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:06,518
He has access to information

183
00:09:06,593 --> 00:09:08,618
and indiscretion
could expose him.

184
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:11,186
You don't know
that this isn'tjust a game.

185
00:09:11,264 --> 00:09:12,526
He's toying with you.

186
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:13,998
Rationing out the facts.

187
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,262
You think he does it
because he gets offon it?

188
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:21,364
No. I think he does it
becauseyou do.

189
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:45,023
Calling it a night

190
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:47,293
Mr. Mulder?

191
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:49,597
My mother usually likes me home

192
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:51,967
before the street lights
come on.

193
00:09:52,038 --> 00:09:53,528
I'm surprised atyou.

194
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,800
Why?

195
00:09:54,908 --> 00:09:57,274
Your level ofcommitment
seems to have diminished.

196
00:09:57,343 --> 00:09:58,674
My level ofcommitment?

197
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:01,612
I expected thatyou'd be
working through the night

198
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:03,410
putting the pieces together.

199
00:10:03,483 --> 00:10:06,213
Maybe ifyou'd given me
something more to workwith.

200
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:07,776
I've given you all I can.

201
00:10:07,854 --> 00:10:08,786
A news report?

202
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:10,220
And where has it led you?

203
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,348
Not very far.

204
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:13,551
It may be further
than you realize.

205
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:15,651
This has always been
on your terms.

206
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:17,218
I've been the dutiful son.

207
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:20,494
This time we canjust cut out
the Obi Wan Kenobi crap

208
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:22,124
and save me the trouble.

209
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:24,999
I fearyou've become
too dependent on me.

210
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:26,629
Look, I've got
plenty to do

211
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:28,900
without chasing down
yourvague leads

212
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:31,442
or trying to decode
your circular logic.

213
00:10:31,511 --> 00:10:34,309
Maybe it's you who's become
too dependent on me--

214
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,473
on mywillingness
to playyour games.

215
00:10:40,286 --> 00:10:42,584
Mr. Mulder?

216
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:43,815
What?

217
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,825
Don't give up on this one.

218
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:48,190
Trust me.

219
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:50,024
You've never been closer.

220
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:51,996
Closer to what?

221
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:11,778
(Door Opening)

222
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:16,580
Hello?

223
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:19,351
Hello?

224
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:20,722
Who's there?

225
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:22,658
Working late tonight, Doctor?

226
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:26,130
What doyou want here?

227
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,170
He's alive, isn't he?

228
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:35,298
Has he contacted you?

229
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,740
Please.

230
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,306
You're going to have to leave.

231
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,247
(Banging Cage Violently)

232
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:46,374
Ifyou're
from the F.B.I.

233
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:48,784
I've already answered
all your questions.

234
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:50,651
What questions?

235
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:52,657
I had nothing to say to them.

236
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,727
I have nothing to say toyou.

237
00:11:54,794 --> 00:11:56,523
Where's Doctor Secare?

238
00:11:56,596 --> 00:11:59,724
I don't know
whatyou're talking about.

239
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:02,596
Please.

240
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:06,832
Mywork is very important.

241
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:08,874
I must get on with mywork.

242
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:11,273
I'm afraid...

243
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:13,107
yourwork is done.

244
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:18,009
(Loud Shattering,
Equipment Falling)

245
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:22,150
Anybody see anything?

246
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:23,347
No.

247
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:27,989
Nothing.

248
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:29,528
I'm calling it off.

249
00:12:29,595 --> 00:12:32,120
Let's get those guys
out ofthe water.

250
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:34,257
Yes, sir.
Bring it in.

251
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:18,576
Scully:
The county sheriffs office
is conducting the investigation.

252
00:13:18,644 --> 00:13:20,236
On the preliminary
reports

253
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:22,281
it's being listed
as a suicide.

254
00:13:22,348 --> 00:13:23,474
Suicide?

255
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:25,676
They think that,
forwhatever reason

256
00:13:25,785 --> 00:13:28,117
he trashed his lab
and then killed himself.

257
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:29,347
How?

258
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:32,947
He tied one end
ofa roll ofmedical gauze

259
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:34,754
around his neck

260
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:37,387
and the other end
to this gas outlet.

261
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:39,556
Then hejumped.

262
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:41,122
Were there anywitnesses?

263
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,132
Nope.

264
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:43,190
He kept this place

265
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:45,203
Iike he was waiting
for the people

266
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:47,205
from Good Housekeeping
to show up.

267
00:13:47,273 --> 00:13:49,798
I would never have pegged him
to do this...

268
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:51,867
or a Greg Louganis
out the window.

269
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:54,378
Scully:
I know. That gauze is troubling.

270
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:57,007
It's a bit too calculated, huh?

271
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:00,075
As ifsomeone wanted
to make doubly sure

272
00:14:00,186 --> 00:14:03,553
he'd break his neck
before he hit the ground.

273
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:06,456
What else do we know
about Dr. Berube?

274
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:08,187
Um...

275
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:09,728
"Terrence Allen Berube.

276
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:11,194
Harvard Med, 1 974."

277
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:12,424
He was working

278
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:14,363
on the Human
Genome Project.

279
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:16,094
Areyou familiar
with that?

280
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:18,467
Yeah. The mapping
ofall human genes.

281
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:20,904
Maybe the most ambitious
scientific endeavor

282
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:22,668
in the history
ofmankind.

283
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:26,941
There's nothing
extraordinary about that.

284
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:28,810
There were
thousands ofscientists

285
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:30,178
working on that project.

286
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:32,547
But only one
who owned a silver Ciera

287
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:34,313
and went bungeejumping

288
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,082
with medical gauze
wrapped around his neck.

289
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,987
I'm seeing the pieces

290
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:41,459
but I'm not seeing
the connection.

291
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:43,051
Mulder:
Maybe that'sjust it.

292
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:44,494
Maybe we're not seeing it

293
00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:47,362
because it can't be seen,
not in any obvious way.

294
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:48,593
What is this?

295
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:50,659
I don't know.

296
00:14:50,736 --> 00:14:52,203
Can you find out?

297
00:14:52,271 --> 00:14:53,863
What will you do?

298
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,341
I'll see what else
I can find out about Dr. Berube.

299
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,878
Okay, Mulder,
but I'm warning you.

300
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:03,347
Ifthis is monkey pee,
you're on your own.

301
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:27,797
(Doorbell Rings)

302
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:04,901
My first impression is

303
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:07,241
it's some kind
ofbacteria specimen.

304
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:09,338
Can I askyou
whereyou got it?

305
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:12,873
It was recovered
at a crime scene.

306
00:16:12,985 --> 00:16:15,146
We've come a long way

307
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:18,917
from Colonel Mustard in the den
with a rope, haven't we?

308
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:20,253
I'm expecting

309
00:16:20,326 --> 00:16:22,317
it will turn out
to be nothing.

310
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:25,022
No. You've definitely
got something here.

311
00:16:25,097 --> 00:16:26,792
Wow. Look at this.

312
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:28,299
Scully:
What are they?

313
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:30,733
They're the size
ofbacteria

314
00:16:30,803 --> 00:16:33,636
but no bacteria
I've ever seen.

315
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:34,866
How doyou mean?

316
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,706
Well, most bacteria are
symmetrical and smooth.

317
00:16:38,778 --> 00:16:41,804
These are...

318
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:44,941
I don't know. It's strange.

319
00:16:45,017 --> 00:16:47,281
You have no way
ofidentifying them?

320
00:16:47,386 --> 00:16:49,047
Well, we could do
a freeze fracture.

321
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:50,520
Take a thin slice off

322
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:52,682
and see what's going on
inside these babies...

323
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:54,657
ifyou don't mind
waiting.

324
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:56,285
No. No, I'll wait.

325
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:20,976
Hi, Danny.
Yeah, it's Mulder again.

326
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:23,055
Look,
I've got a number this time--

327
00:17:23,122 --> 00:17:25,488
555-2804, area code 301 .

328
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:29,153
I need an address,
a name ifyou can get it for me.

329
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:30,957
All right. I'm at, uh...

330
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,588
same prefix, 1 51 7.

331
00:17:32,665 --> 00:17:34,360

335
00:17:58,324 --> 00:18:00,053
Yeah.

Who's this?

337
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:03,592
They shot me, Terry.

338
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:04,822
Oh, God.

339
00:18:04,897 --> 00:18:07,161
I've been in the water
for three days.

340
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:08,165
I'm hurt.

341
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:09,724
Where areyou now?

342
00:18:09,802 --> 00:18:10,962
At a pay phone.

343
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:12,936
I'll pickyou up. Where areyou?

344
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:13,972
Terry...

345
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:17,840
You okay?

346
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,104
Areyou there?

347
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:21,043
Hello?

348
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:22,910
Hello. This man's
been hurt here.

349
00:18:22,982 --> 00:18:24,847
I think he needs
medical attention.

350
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:26,748
What's the street?
What's the street?

351
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:28,820
I'm going to call
an ambulance.

352
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:29,979
Sir?

353
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:35,389
(Telephone Ringing)

354
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:36,325
Don't hang up.

355
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:37,487
You got it.

356
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,722
Hi, Danny.

357
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:39,923
I got it.

358
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:42,364
Let me get the address.

359
00:18:42,435 --> 00:18:45,598
All right, you ready?
Mulder?

360
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:47,901
I'm just writing it down now.
Go ahead.

361
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:50,908
Belongs to a company called
Zeus Storage. 1 61 6 Pandora.

362
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:53,035
Zeus Storage. Yeah.

363
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:55,637
1 61 6 Pandora Street.

364
00:18:55,714 --> 00:18:56,646
That's it.

00:18:56,715 --> 00:18:58,546
All right, thanks.

366
00:19:02,254 --> 00:19:04,222
(Siren Wailing)

367
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:07,959
Medic:
White male, 40,
weakvitals

368
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:10,325
severe dyspnea
and hypotension.

369
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:12,021
He also has
a green fuid

370
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:13,359
coming from a wound

371
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:14,490
right upper quadrant.

372
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,568
Doctor:
ls he responding to CPR?

373
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:19,126
No, and we're noticing
rope veins at the neck

374
00:19:19,238 --> 00:19:21,570
and a hypersonant
sounding chest.

375
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,574
He's going real blue
on us now.

376
00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:25,667
Release the air
pressing on the heart cavity.

377
00:19:25,744 --> 00:19:28,008
I'm going to need
a cannula.

378
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,572
We're going to do
a needle decompression.

379
00:19:34,553 --> 00:19:36,453
(Air Rushes Out)

380
00:19:36,522 --> 00:19:37,454
Ah...

381
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:39,514
(Coughing)

382
00:19:45,197 --> 00:19:47,358
Doctor:
What's going on in there?

383
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:52,130
(Coughing)

384
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:56,564
Answer me.

385
00:19:58,244 --> 00:20:00,144
What is the problem?

386
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,043
Come in, please!

387
00:20:03,115 --> 00:20:05,242
(Telephone Ringing)

388
00:20:05,317 --> 00:20:06,648
Mulder.

389
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:08,016
It's me.

390
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:09,520
He's alive, Scully.

391
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:10,452
Who?

392
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:12,218
The driver ofthe silver Ciera.

393
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,020
He called the doctor's house.

394
00:20:14,093 --> 00:20:15,082
Where is he now?

395
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,151
I don't know. Where areyou?

396
00:20:17,229 --> 00:20:20,130
I'm at the Georgetown
Microbiology Department.

397
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:21,996
I've got something foryou.

398
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:24,297
Is it smaller
than a silver Ciera?

399
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,302
Much.

400
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:27,305
And it's not silver.
It's green.

401
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:28,670
What is it?

402
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:31,835
Some kind ofbacteria,
each containing virus.

403
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:34,880
Berube may have been
cloning them.

404
00:20:34,947 --> 00:20:37,939
They also contain something
that looks like chloroplasts--

405
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:39,245
plant cells.

406
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:41,081
They've never seen
anything like it.

407
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:43,451
What could he have
been doing with them?

408
00:20:43,522 --> 00:20:46,514
The only reason you clone
a virus inside a bacteria

409
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:48,958
is to inject it
into something living.

410
00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:50,552
It's called gene therapy

411
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:53,359
and it's still
highly experimental.

412
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:56,332
Maybe that's what he was doing
with those monkeys.

413
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:58,199
Can they tell you anything else?

414
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,398
They'rejust about to run
some primary cell cultures

415
00:21:01,473 --> 00:21:02,906
and a DNA sequence.

416
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:07,469
Now, I may be understating
the strangeness ofthis, Mulder.

417
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:09,104
Bacteria like this--

418
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:12,981
it may have existed,
but not for millions ofyears...

419
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:17,284
not since before our ancestors
first crawled out ofthe sea.

420
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:22,016
Areyou there, Mulder?

421
00:21:24,396 --> 00:21:25,795
Yeah.

422
00:21:25,864 --> 00:21:27,593
Scully, keep up
the good work.

423
00:23:39,198 --> 00:23:40,290
Agent Scully.

424
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:43,232
Oh, Dr. Carpenter,
I fell asleep.

425
00:23:43,302 --> 00:23:44,860
I've done some work.

426
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:48,839
These are
the DNA sequences

427
00:23:48,907 --> 00:23:51,933
from the bacteria sample
you brought in.

428
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,444
You know something
about molecular biology.

429
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:55,844
What areyou
looking at?

430
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:58,439
I think
those are genes.

431
00:23:58,517 --> 00:24:00,644
Right.
They're called base pairs.

432
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:02,016
Each pair is made up

433
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:04,248
ofsomething
called a nucleotide.

434
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:07,019
Only four nucleotides
exist in DNA, four.

435
00:24:07,092 --> 00:24:09,322
And through
some miracle ofdesign

436
00:24:09,428 --> 00:24:11,123
that we haveyet
to fathom

437
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,221
every living thing
is created

438
00:24:13,332 --> 00:24:16,301
out ofthese four
basic building blocks.

439
00:24:16,368 --> 00:24:20,168
Whatyou're looking at
is a sequence ofgenes

440
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:22,366
from the bacteria sample.

441
00:24:22,441 --> 00:24:26,309
Normally, we'd find no gaps
in the sequence.

442
00:24:26,378 --> 00:24:30,007
But with these bacteria,
we do.

443
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:31,515
Why is that?

444
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:32,811
I don't know why.

445
00:24:32,885 --> 00:24:36,013
But I tell you,
under any other circumstances

446
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:39,319
my first call would have been
to the government.

447
00:24:39,391 --> 00:24:41,882
What exactly did you find?

448
00:24:43,762 --> 00:24:46,890
A fifth and sixth
DNA nucleotide--

449
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:48,762
a new base pair.

450
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:50,199
Agent Scully

451
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:52,760
whatyou
are looking at

452
00:24:52,871 --> 00:24:55,669
it exists nowhere in nature.

453
00:24:55,741 --> 00:24:59,336
It would have to be
by definition...

454
00:24:59,411 --> 00:25:02,141
extraterrestrial.

455
00:25:59,271 --> 00:26:02,263
(Ringing)

456
00:26:10,482 --> 00:26:11,574
Hello.

457
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,346
Mulder? Where on God's Earth
haveyou been?

458
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:16,819
I've been trying
to call you all night.

459
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:18,186
I had a situation.

460
00:26:18,257 --> 00:26:20,384
I left my phone in the car.

461
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:22,154
Mulder...

462
00:26:22,227 --> 00:26:24,320
that bacteria I had analyzed--

463
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:28,763
They're saying
that it doesn't exist in nature.

464
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:32,735
They're saying that it
could be extraterrestrial.

465
00:26:32,804 --> 00:26:34,169
Scully...

466
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:35,900
What?

467
00:26:35,974 --> 00:26:37,441
How soon can you be here?

468
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:39,602
There's something
I gotta showyou.

469
00:26:56,795 --> 00:26:58,763
Wait a second.

470
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,559
Mulder...

471
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:05,492
I just want to say
that I was wrong.

472
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,765
That's all right.
Don't worry about it.

473
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:09,932
No, um...

474
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:13,603
ifyou'd have listened to me,
we wouldn't be here right now.

475
00:27:13,712 --> 00:27:16,704
I should know by now
to trustyour instincts.

476
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:18,476
Why? Nobody else does.

477
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:22,316
You know,
I've always held science

478
00:27:22,387 --> 00:27:23,615
as sacred.

479
00:27:23,689 --> 00:27:27,250
I've always put my trust
in the accepted facts.

480
00:27:27,326 --> 00:27:29,419
And what I saw last night...

481
00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:34,227
for the first time in my life,
I don't know what to believe.

482
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:37,598
Whatever it is
you do believe, Scully

483
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:40,467
when you walk into that room...

484
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:43,007
nothing sacred will hold.

485
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:00,891
There were tanks here...

486
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:03,484
and five bodies
suspended in solution.

487
00:28:03,562 --> 00:28:05,996
There were computers
monitoring them.

488
00:28:06,064 --> 00:28:08,532
Theywere alive, Scully,
underwater.

489
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,830
What happened to them?

490
00:28:10,902 --> 00:28:12,927
God only knows.

491
00:28:13,005 --> 00:28:14,233
Most likely

492
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:16,774
they've been destroyed.

493
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:17,934
Miss Scully.

494
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:19,977
We met
ever so briefy.

495
00:28:20,045 --> 00:28:21,239
Destroyed bywhom?

496
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:22,540
I don't know.

497
00:28:22,614 --> 00:28:23,945
I don't believeyou.

498
00:28:24,016 --> 00:28:26,177
There are limits
to my knowledge

499
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:27,479
Mr. Mulder.

500
00:28:27,552 --> 00:28:29,315
Inside the intelligence
community

501
00:28:29,388 --> 00:28:31,754
there are so-called
black organizations--

502
00:28:31,823 --> 00:28:34,519
groups within groups
conducting covert activities

503
00:28:34,593 --> 00:28:36,561
unknown at the highest
levels ofpower.

504
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:38,687
There were three men--
I was chased.

505
00:28:38,764 --> 00:28:40,891
Ifyou were chased,
you would have been killed.

506
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:42,797
Those men
are trained well

507
00:28:42,868 --> 00:28:45,234
for that sort
ofbusiness.

508
00:28:45,303 --> 00:28:47,066
Were those
the same men

509
00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:48,800
who killed
Dr. Berube?

510
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:49,806
Presumably.

511
00:28:49,908 --> 00:28:51,205
Why?

512
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:52,367
Why? Good Lord.

513
00:28:52,477 --> 00:28:53,774
You've worked so hard

514
00:28:53,845 --> 00:28:56,040
and you still
don't see it.

515
00:28:56,114 --> 00:28:58,048
Dr. Berube was conducting
human experiments

516
00:28:58,116 --> 00:28:59,447
with extraterrestrial viruses.

517
00:28:59,518 --> 00:29:01,850
Yes, but that's been going on
foryears.

518
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,751
We've had the tissue since 1 947

519
00:29:03,822 --> 00:29:05,687
but not
the technology.

520
00:29:05,757 --> 00:29:06,781
Roswell?

521
00:29:06,858 --> 00:29:08,587
Roswell was a smoke screen.

522
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,857
We've had a halfa dozen
better salvage operations.

523
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,261
Dr. Berube was killed

524
00:29:13,331 --> 00:29:15,561
because his work
was too successful.

525
00:29:15,634 --> 00:29:17,295
You're standing
in the room

526
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:19,530
where the first
DNA transplant took

527
00:29:19,604 --> 00:29:22,266
the first human-alien
hybrid was created.

528
00:29:22,374 --> 00:29:24,137
Six volunteer patients

529
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:25,675
all terminally ill.

530
00:29:25,744 --> 00:29:27,905
One, Dr. William Secare,
an old friend

531
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:29,241
of Dr. Berube's

532
00:29:29,314 --> 00:29:31,282
was dying
ofmelanoma cancer.

533
00:29:31,383 --> 00:29:33,442
And as a result

534
00:29:33,518 --> 00:29:34,951
ofthe E.T.
gene therapy

535
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,250
all six patients
treated in this room

536
00:29:37,322 --> 00:29:39,688
began to recover
from their illnesses.

537
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:41,282
Dr. Secare
was able to live

538
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:43,190
a more or less
normal life--

539
00:29:43,261 --> 00:29:44,660
as normal as possible

540
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:47,391
for a man who has developed
inhuman strength

541
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:49,525
and the ability
to breathe underwater.

542
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:53,765
That's how he eluded capture.

543
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:56,069
What was he running from?

544
00:29:56,174 --> 00:30:00,270
Dr. Secare was never
supposed to have survived.

545
00:30:00,378 --> 00:30:01,902
Dr. Berube's research was part

546
00:30:02,013 --> 00:30:05,414
ofa top secret
government project.

547
00:30:05,484 --> 00:30:08,044
All theywere interested in
was the technology.

548
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,453
To have a hybrid living
out in the real world--

549
00:30:11,523 --> 00:30:13,047
too great a liability.

550
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:14,683
What ifhe should need

551
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:16,056
emergency
medical procedure?

552
00:30:16,128 --> 00:30:18,358
The man has
a blood chemistry

553
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,864
that is alien

554
00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:22,092
and very likely toxic.

555
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:23,930
That story should hit the press.

556
00:30:24,002 --> 00:30:25,993
It was easier
to kill Dr. Secare.

557
00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:26,935
Ofcourse.

558
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:28,836
There was only one problem.

559
00:30:28,907 --> 00:30:30,636
Dr. Berube was able
to warn him.

560
00:30:30,742 --> 00:30:33,142
There'sjust one thing
I don't understand--

561
00:30:33,211 --> 00:30:36,180
whyyou gave us so little
to go on in the beginning.

562
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:38,374
And why areyou
giving us so much now?

563
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,884
I didn't anticipate
the speed and precision

564
00:30:40,952 --> 00:30:42,476
oftheir cleanup operation.

565
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:45,455
They're systematically
destroying all the evidence--

566
00:30:45,524 --> 00:30:47,116
Dr. Berube, the bodies here.

567
00:30:47,192 --> 00:30:48,250
Without the evidence

568
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:49,816
you two
have no case.

569
00:30:49,895 --> 00:30:51,954
Who would believe
the story

570
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,224
I just told you?

571
00:30:53,298 --> 00:30:54,959
You must put together

572
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:56,762
everything thatyou have found

573
00:30:56,835 --> 00:30:59,463
and you must find Dr. Secare
before they do.

574
00:30:59,538 --> 00:31:03,497
I'll have no further contact
with you on this matter.

575
00:31:10,348 --> 00:31:12,282
I'm going to get back
to Georgetown

576
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,284
and get
all the lab work.

577
00:31:14,352 --> 00:31:16,081
I'm going to find
Dr. Secare.

578
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:17,280
Where?

579
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:19,346
I don't know.
I'm going to trust my instincts.

580
00:31:26,898 --> 00:31:29,025
I'm looking
for Dr. Ann Carpenter.

581
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,534
I've been unable
to reach her by phone

582
00:31:31,603 --> 00:31:33,264
and she's not in her office.

583
00:31:33,338 --> 00:31:35,533
She was
in a terrible car accident...

584
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,834
herwhole family.

585
00:31:36,942 --> 00:31:41,970
And Dr. Carpenter
is, um, dead.

586
00:31:56,761 --> 00:31:58,991
(Thump)

587
00:32:17,682 --> 00:32:19,775
(Thump)

588
00:32:31,263 --> 00:32:33,231
Dr. Secare?

589
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,374
Wait!

590
00:32:57,656 --> 00:32:59,886
I'll protectyou.

591
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:01,186
(Gunshot)

592
00:33:05,297 --> 00:33:07,128
(Air Rushes Out)

593
00:33:07,198 --> 00:33:08,825
Ah...!

594
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,501
(Coughing)

595
00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:20,209
(Ringing)

596
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:44,695
Your cellular phone's
been ringing offthe hook.

597
00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:47,567
I'm a popular guy.

598
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:49,698
Why don'tyou answer it for me?

599
00:33:49,808 --> 00:33:52,936
Oh, I don't like
talking on the phone.

600
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:55,376
I have this thing
about unsecured lines.

601
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:58,439
When you feel
like talking

602
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,450
Iet me know, though.

603
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,625
He's not home.

604
00:34:17,702 --> 00:34:18,964
Where is he?

605
00:34:19,037 --> 00:34:20,368
He's been gone
all night.

606
00:34:20,438 --> 00:34:21,905
I wish I knew.

607
00:34:21,973 --> 00:34:23,463
Something's
happened to him.

608
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:24,872
Theywon't kill him.

609
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:26,500
How doyou know that?

610
00:34:26,611 --> 00:34:28,272
He's become too high-profile

611
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,474
and you've got evidence
that could expose them.

612
00:34:31,616 --> 00:34:32,480
They took the evidence

613
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,075
and they may have killed
in order to get it.

614
00:34:35,153 --> 00:34:36,643
The evidence
still exists.

615
00:34:36,721 --> 00:34:37,619
Where?

616
00:34:37,689 --> 00:34:39,850
It might be difficult
to obtain

617
00:34:39,924 --> 00:34:42,256
but with your
medical background

618
00:34:42,327 --> 00:34:44,124
I might be able
to getyou inside.

619
00:34:44,195 --> 00:34:45,127
Inside where?

620
00:34:45,196 --> 00:34:46,925
The high-containment facility

621
00:34:46,998 --> 00:34:48,226
at Fort Marlene, Maryland.

622
00:34:48,299 --> 00:34:49,596
What do they have there?

623
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:51,794
The wellspring, Miss Scully--

624
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,201
the original tissue.

625
00:34:53,271 --> 00:34:55,239
Ifthey've got
Agent Mulder

626
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,104
they might be willing
to make a deal.

627
00:34:58,209 --> 00:35:01,144
It could save his life.

628
00:36:47,852 --> 00:36:49,649
(Click)

629
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:02,864
Name?

630
00:37:06,638 --> 00:37:07,798
Dana Scully.

631
00:37:07,872 --> 00:37:09,396
Company or institution?

632
00:37:09,507 --> 00:37:10,599
Federal Government.

633
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:11,970
Project password?

634
00:37:20,885 --> 00:37:23,149
Project password?

635
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:28,023
Purity Control.

636
00:37:49,781 --> 00:37:51,612
Log in, please.

637
00:40:08,252 --> 00:40:10,277
You're late.

638
00:40:10,354 --> 00:40:11,651
Doyou have it?

639
00:40:11,723 --> 00:40:12,553
Yes.

640
00:40:12,623 --> 00:40:14,147
Good.
They're willing

641
00:40:14,225 --> 00:40:15,817
to make the exchange.

642
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:17,485
You spoke to them?

643
00:40:17,562 --> 00:40:18,586
Yes.

644
00:40:18,663 --> 00:40:20,494
I'll take the parcel.

645
00:40:20,565 --> 00:40:21,623
No, sir.

646
00:40:21,699 --> 00:40:24,327
I'll make the exchange.

647
00:40:24,402 --> 00:40:25,664
I made the deal, Scully.

648
00:40:25,737 --> 00:40:27,261
They're expecting me.

649
00:40:27,338 --> 00:40:29,169
I don't trustyou.

650
00:40:29,273 --> 00:40:31,036
There's no one else to trust.

651
00:40:31,142 --> 00:40:32,769
I don't know whoyou are.

652
00:40:32,877 --> 00:40:34,504
I know nothing aboutyou.

653
00:40:34,612 --> 00:40:36,170
For God's sake

654
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,077
don't screw this up.

655
00:40:38,149 --> 00:40:40,481
In 1 987, a group ofchildren
from a Southern state

656
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:42,746
were given
what their parents thought

657
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,048
was a routine inoculation.

658
00:40:44,122 --> 00:40:45,680
What theywere injected with

659
00:40:45,757 --> 00:40:47,486
was a clone DNA

660
00:40:47,558 --> 00:40:49,025
from the contents
ofthat package

661
00:40:49,093 --> 00:40:50,685
you're holding
as a test.

662
00:40:50,762 --> 00:40:52,821
That's the kind ofpeople
you're dealing with.

663
00:40:52,897 --> 00:40:54,489
So, why give it back to them?

664
00:40:54,565 --> 00:40:56,931
To save Mulder's life.

665
00:40:57,001 --> 00:40:59,128
At the risk ofother lives?

666
00:40:59,203 --> 00:41:03,367
You and Mulder are the ones
who can bring it to light.

667
00:41:03,474 --> 00:41:05,271
Now, give me
the parcel.

668
00:41:13,117 --> 00:41:15,585
Give me the parcel, Scully.

669
00:42:04,135 --> 00:42:05,932
No!

670
00:42:15,146 --> 00:42:16,670
Mulder. Mulder.

671
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:32,153
Trust...

672
00:42:37,134 --> 00:42:38,965
trust...

673
00:42:40,338 --> 00:42:42,203
no one.

674
00:43:27,418 --> 00:43:28,885
(Telephone Ringing)

675
00:43:30,955 --> 00:43:32,980
Hello.

676
00:43:33,057 --> 00:43:35,423
Mulder:
Hey, Scully, it's me.

677
00:43:35,493 --> 00:43:37,188
Where areyou?

678
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,693
They're shutting us down,
Scully.

679
00:43:40,765 --> 00:43:42,562
What?

680
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:44,828
They called me in tonight

681
00:43:44,902 --> 00:43:46,267
and they said

682
00:43:46,337 --> 00:43:48,703
they're going to reassign us
to other sections.

683
00:43:48,773 --> 00:43:51,264
Who told you that?

684
00:43:51,342 --> 00:43:53,242
Skinner.

685
00:43:53,344 --> 00:43:55,869
He said word came down
from the top

686
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,811
ofthe executive branch.

687
00:43:57,882 --> 00:43:58,871
Mulder...

688
00:43:58,983 --> 00:44:00,746
It's over, Scully.

689
00:44:00,818 --> 00:44:02,683
Lodge a protest. They can't...

690
00:44:02,753 --> 00:44:04,448
Yes, they can.

691
00:44:06,624 --> 00:44:09,320
What areyou going to do?

692
00:44:09,393 --> 00:44:10,917
I'm...

693
00:44:12,196 --> 00:44:14,164
not going to give up.

694
00:44:14,231 --> 00:44:15,926
I can't give up...

695
00:44:19,837 --> 00:44:22,271
not as long
as the truth is out there.
