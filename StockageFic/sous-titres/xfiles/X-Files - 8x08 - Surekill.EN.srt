You're here early.

363
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:55,361
You know you accidentally
left your car running?

364
00:25:57,603 --> 00:26:00,572
You must have been in
a real hurry to get in here...

365
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:02,539
and make the coffee.

366
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:05,610
What you got there?

367
00:26:07,145 --> 00:26:09,272
Can I see?

368
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:13,006
Dwight Cooper. FBI.

369
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,923
Dwight Cooper,
warrant to search.

370
00:26:23,662 --> 00:26:25,220
Have someone...

371
00:26:25,297 --> 00:26:26,662
read it to you.

372
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:31,025
What the hell...

373
00:26:31,103 --> 00:26:32,331
are you looking for?

374
00:26:32,371 --> 00:26:33,963
Evidence related
to the murder...

375
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:36,132
of Carlton Chase, et al.

376
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:39,942
What's in the box?

377
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,572
You got me.

378
00:26:49,488 --> 00:26:51,422
What's the combination?

379
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:56,261
I don't remember.

380
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:59,263
So much for
the easy way.

381
00:27:10,275 --> 00:27:12,072
You owe me for that.

382
00:27:12,144 --> 00:27:14,237
I run a clean
business here.

383
00:27:14,313 --> 00:27:16,008
You're not going
to fiind anything...

384
00:27:16,081 --> 00:27:17,480
that's going
to say otherwise.

385
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:19,210
I wouldn't be so sure.

386
00:27:21,553 --> 00:27:23,987
Can you explain these,
Mr. Cooper?

387
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:29,556
So, Mr. Cooper, you want to tell
me about these invoices?

388
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:45,575
Okay, Randall...

389
00:27:45,644 --> 00:27:49,637
let's talk about your
exterminating company.

390
00:27:49,715 --> 00:27:52,946
It's just the three
of you, right?

391
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:56,454
You and your brother
and Tammi Peyton?

392
00:27:58,557 --> 00:28:00,491
So, how is it...

393
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,553
that your little company billed
over $700,000 to Chase Realty...

394
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,394
last year?

395
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:11,698
$700,000.

396
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:14,297
That's a lot of dead rats.

397
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:17,137
I think...

398
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:20,178
that you and your brother
and Carlton Chase...

399
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:23,043
were in a whole
other business together.

400
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:33,587
Man, I got to get
into the bug business.

401
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:35,149
I had no idea...

402
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:36,524
you could make
so much dough...

403
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:39,086
killing things that
creep around behind walls.

404
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,327
You are quite the entrepreneur.

405
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:51,331
I'm just a regular Joe,
providing a public service.

406
00:29:00,185 --> 00:29:01,550
Randall?

407
00:29:04,756 --> 00:29:09,693
I'm just a regular Joe
providing a public service.

408
00:29:19,371 --> 00:29:22,397
Is that what your brother
just said to Agent Doggett?

409
00:29:32,784 --> 00:29:36,242
You know why I said that,
don't you?

410
00:29:36,321 --> 00:29:39,188
Because somehow...

411
00:29:39,257 --> 00:29:41,418
you can see through that wall.

412
00:29:43,795 --> 00:29:46,229
You can see your brother
behind me...

413
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:48,129
and you can read his lips.

414
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,499
I don't know what
gives you the ability...

415
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,765
but I know
how you use it.

416
00:29:53,805 --> 00:29:55,864
You shoot drug dealers...

417
00:29:56,108 --> 00:29:58,303
from places where
they can't see you...

418
00:29:58,343 --> 00:29:59,571
and then you...

419
00:29:59,644 --> 00:30:01,578
and Dwight rob them.

420
00:30:03,115 --> 00:30:06,175
That's how you make
all that money, isn't it?

421
00:30:08,286 --> 00:30:11,312
No. We're exterminators.

422
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:13,653
Yeah.

423
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:18,228
You certainly are.

424
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:24,368
And talking to you now...

425
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:28,167
I think that the whole thing
is Dwight's idea.

426
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:37,270
It's time to be your own man,
Randall.

427
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:40,716
It's time to think for yourself.

428
00:31:02,841 --> 00:31:05,503
You tell them anything?

429
00:31:05,577 --> 00:31:08,637
No. I said what you said.

430
00:31:08,713 --> 00:31:10,647
Well, we got a problem.

431
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,516
It needs to
be taken care of.

432
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,417
I just keep the books.

433
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:21,686
You keep the books...

434
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,785

We're supposed to believe...

437
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:28,355
you didn't know
what was going on?

438
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,662
The drug rip-offs,
the murders?

439
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:31,964
I didn't know about any of that.

440
00:31:32,204 --> 00:31:34,399
Dwight doesn't tell me anything.

441
00:31:34,472 --> 00:31:36,565
I just book the cash receipts.

442
00:31:39,744 --> 00:31:41,769
I don't ask where they're from.

443
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:45,649
I know not to ask.

444
00:31:47,385 --> 00:31:49,910
Look, here's where
I get confused...

445
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:53,389
and I'm hoping that
you can help me out.

446
00:31:53,425 --> 00:31:56,326
Carlton Chase.

447
00:31:56,394 --> 00:31:59,693
We think Chase...

448
00:31:59,764 --> 00:32:01,391
was Dwight's fence.

449
00:32:01,466 --> 00:32:03,764
He sold the drugs
your boss stole.

450
00:32:03,802 --> 00:32:05,861
Together, they had
a good thing going.

451
00:32:05,937 --> 00:32:07,632
So why, then,
was Chase killed?

452
00:32:07,706 --> 00:32:09,503
It seems like bad business.

453
00:32:09,574 --> 00:32:11,667
Unless the reason
wasn't business.

454
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:15,579
Unless it was personal.

455
00:32:20,018 --> 00:32:21,918

00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,905

that something's going on...

between his girlfriend

00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:56,802
She used you.

544
00:40:00,745 --> 00:40:01,837
Look at me, Randall.

545
00:40:07,351 --> 00:40:13,119
I'm the one who loves you,
not her.

546
00:40:13,191 --> 00:40:17,287
Not anybody else.

547
00:40:17,361 --> 00:40:19,989
Because we're blood.

548
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,691
That's thicker than anything.

549
00:40:35,046 --> 00:40:38,072
I'm going to walk away now...

550
00:40:38,149 --> 00:40:41,312
and I'm going to think hard
about how I can forgive you.

551
00:40:51,162 --> 00:40:53,096
You know what you got to do.

552
00:41:07,912 --> 00:41:09,174
Randall.

553
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:15,051
You're not going to do this.

554
00:41:20,391 --> 00:41:23,758
[Whimpering ]

555
00:41:28,232 --> 00:41:31,030
Randall, please.

556
00:41:34,172 --> 00:41:37,335
I was coming back for you.

557
00:41:43,181 --> 00:41:44,842
No, you weren't.

558
00:41:50,888 --> 00:41:52,253
Randall!

559
00:41:54,592 --> 00:41:55,854
No!

560
00:41:55,927 --> 00:41:57,519
[ Gunshot ]

561
00:42:17,815 --> 00:42:19,874
[ Doggett ]
Agent.

562
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:21,316
Has he said anything?

563
00:42:21,385 --> 00:42:23,410
Well, a county D.A.
came in...

564
00:42:23,487 --> 00:42:25,455
and he declined representation.

565
00:42:25,523 --> 00:42:28,321
Aside from that,
he's been uncommunicative.

566
00:42:33,297 --> 00:42:36,232
APB on Tammi Peyton's
a wash so far.

567
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,064
The Bureau in Montana's
on alert.

568
00:42:44,475 --> 00:42:47,842
He watched her every day...

569
00:42:47,912 --> 00:42:49,140
wherever she was.

570
00:42:49,213 --> 00:42:52,080
A man who can look at
anything in the world...

571
00:42:52,149 --> 00:42:54,014
and he chooses her.

572
00:42:57,221 --> 00:43:02,853
He must've seen something in her
she couldn't see in herself.

573
00:43:02,927 --> 00:43:07,125
Well, if you're suggesting he could
see into her heart, Agent...

574
00:43:07,198 --> 00:43:10,895
I think we're out of FBI
territory on this one.

575
00:43:13,504 --> 00:43:15,096
I'll be out front.

576
00:44:27,979 --> 00:44:29,447
[Child ]
I made this!

577
00:44:29,447 --> 00:44:32,439
[Child ]
I made this!
