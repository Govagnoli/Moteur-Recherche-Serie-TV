over our existence.

The stories passed
from generation to generation...

4
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:19,325
help us to understand the reason
for our tears of sadness...

5
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:21,799
and tears of joy.

00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:25,565
Animals like the bear,
the spider and the coyote...

are powerful symbols
to our people.

00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:35,211
When the FBI man Mulder
was cured by the holy people,

9
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:38,284
we were reminded of the story
of the Gila Monster,

10
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:42,253
who symbolizes the healing powers
of the Medicine Man.

11
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:45,587
In this myth, the Gila Monster
restores a man...

12
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:49,993
by taking all his parts
and putting them back together.

13
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:54,796

his eyes and ears by Sun,

At the end of the ceremony,

00:01:14,254 --> 00:01:16,950
when the FBI man
had been healed,

19
00:01:17,023 --> 00:01:21,050
we heard the news from other Native
Americans in the Northern Plains...

20
00:01:21,128 --> 00:01:24,620
that a great event
had taken place.

21
00:01:24,765 --> 00:01:29,327
Like the Navajo, these people
have their own stories and myths.

22
00:01:29,403 --> 00:01:32,600
One of these stories tells
of the White Buffalo Woman...

23
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,005
who came down from the heavens
and taught the Indians...

24
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:38,237
how to lead virtuous lives...

25
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:41,075
and how to pray to the Creator.

26
00:01:41,148 --> 00:01:43,946
She told the people
she would return one day.

27
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:47,783
Then she turned into a white buffalo
and ascended into the clouds,

28
00:01:47,854 --> 00:01:52,154
never to be seen again.

29
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:58,130
But on this day, when the holy people
had given the FBI man a miracle,

30
00:01:58,198 --> 00:02:00,962
a white buffalo was born.

31
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:05,630
And every Native American knew,
whether he believed the story or not,

32
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:08,640
that this was
a powerful omen...

33
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:11,370

were coming.

This man's name is Albert Hosteen.
You should remember that,

497
00:41:18,823 --> 00:41:20,814
because if agents Mulder and Scully come
down with so much as a case of the flu,

498
00:41:20,892 --> 00:41:25,556
Albert is prepared to recite,
chapter and verse, everything
on your precious tape.

499
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:30,067
- That's a nice try, Skinner.
- I'm sure you’re thinking
Albert is an old man,

500
00:41:30,134 --> 00:41:33,831
and there are plenty of ways
you might kill him too.

501
00:41:33,905 --> 00:41:36,032
Which is why, in the ancient
oral tradition of his people,

502
00:41:36,107 --> 00:41:40,510
he's told 20 other men
the information on those files.

503
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:45,106
So unless you kill every Navajo
living in four states,

504
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:48,310
that information is available
with a simple phone call.

505
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:53,283
Welcome to the wonderful world
of high technology.

506
00:41:53,357 --> 00:41:57,589
- You're bluffing.
- Am I ?

507
00:42:00,798 --> 00:42:04,393
[Door Opens, Closes]

508
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,550
It happened three hours ago.

509
00:42:25,623 --> 00:42:29,992
She went into surgery, and the damage to
her brain was worse then they had hoped.

510
00:42:31,229 --> 00:42:35,723
Her blood pressure
started to rise, and, um,

511
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,496
she slipped away.

512
00:42:41,138 --> 00:42:43,470
She died for me,

513
00:42:43,541 --> 00:42:47,671
and I tried to tell her
that I was sorry, but I don't
think she'll ever really know.

514
00:42:47,778 --> 00:42:51,475
Oh, she knows.

515
00:42:51,549 --> 00:42:53,483
Melissa knows.

516
00:42:55,953 --> 00:43:00,754
You were right.
There is no justice.

517
00:43:02,093 --> 00:43:04,186
I don't think this is
about justice, Scully.

518
00:43:04,262 --> 00:43:09,928
- Then what is it about ?
- I think it's about something
we have no personal choice in.

519
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:12,492
I think it's about fate.

520
00:43:21,445 --> 00:43:24,414
Skinner told me
that he talked to you,

521
00:43:24,515 --> 00:43:27,575
that you were insistent
about coming back to work.

522
00:43:29,287 --> 00:43:33,018
- Now, if Melissa's death is--
- I need something
to put my back up against.

523
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:37,789
I feel the same way.
We both lost so much.

524
00:43:41,966 --> 00:43:44,298
I believe that
what we're looking for...

525
00:43:44,368 --> 00:43:49,169
is in the X-Files and more certain
than ever that the truth is in there.

526
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,765
I've heard the truth, Mulder.

527
00:43:53,177 --> 00:43:56,340
Now what I want
are the answers.
