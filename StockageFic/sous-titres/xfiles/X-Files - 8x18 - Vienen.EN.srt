- About what?

199
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:10,881
About what I found in my autopsy
of the oil rig accident victim
Simon de la Cruz.

200
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,884
Agent Scully, this man's body
was supposed to be...

201
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:15,386
transported back to Mexico
completely intact.

202
00:16:15,421 --> 00:16:19,585

the third ventricle of his brain.

- No, it's okay, it's all right.

under the impression this stuff...

into a man's body.

206
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:34,697
No, it can, and I've seen that
happen, but that's the thing.

207
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:37,709
I mean, this man was clearly
infected by the alien virus.

208
00:16:37,777 --> 00:16:41,042
It entered his system and it
was massing in the pineal gland.

209
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,441
But it's dead.

What killed it?

211
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:48,785
Well, intuitively, you would say
the same thing that killed him:

levels of radiation.

213
00:16:50,856 --> 00:16:55,316
But it makes no sense because the
virus itself has radioactive properties.

Agent Doggett that.

He needs to have an idea
of what he's dealing with.

I'm right here.

That's someone
knocking on the door.

502

Mulder, listen to me.

503
00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:30,316
I think I know why they killed this
man, if not how they killed him.

504
00:37:30,528 --> 00:37:32,996
Right now we got bigger
problems. We need a chopper.

505
00:37:33,064 --> 00:37:34,929
We've got choppers on the way.

506

Tell her all the men here
are infected.

507
00:37:37,535 --> 00:37:41,767
She's got to get
the word to the choppers
not to land on the platform.

508
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,899
Well, how are they
supposed to get us?

509

Well, that issue
is rapidly becoming moot!

510
00:37:48,646 --> 00:37:52,605

There are three men on board
here that are not infected--

511
00:37:52,684 --> 00:37:56,552
me, Mulder and a man named Diego
Garza, who may be mentally unstable.

512
00:37:56,588 --> 00:37:58,579
Could be why he tried to
wreck this radio equipment...

513
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,022
just like his friend,
Simon de la Cruz.

514
00:38:01,092 --> 00:38:05,085
He may resist rescue because
he believes there men in flying
saucers are coming to get him.

515
00:38:05,163 --> 00:38:09,065
Agent Scully, did you get that? Agent

- I'm talking about contact.

I know why they let us go.
