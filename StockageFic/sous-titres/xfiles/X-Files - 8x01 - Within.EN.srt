1
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
What is this?!

2
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,500
Excuse me.

3
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,700
Can somebody please tell me
what's going on here?

4
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,700
We're collecting material.

5
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,400
For?

6
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,900
For anything that might be
pertinent to the manhunt. 

7
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,900
What manhunt?
Manhunt for who?

8
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,300
You're kidding, right? 

9
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,100
Look, there's nothing. If you're looking
for Mulder, you're wasting your time.

10
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,900
- Are you listening to me?
- I'm not the man to talk to.

11
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,700
Well, then whose stupid idea is this? 

12
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,700
Yeah, well, somebody might have
had the courtesy to tell me.

13
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,800
There are agents tearing apart
Mulder's office...

14
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,600
...who say they're part of
an FBI manhunt.

15
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,600
I know. I heard.
Believe me, this is not my idea.

16
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,800
I just found out about it myself.

17
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,000
They're not going to find Mulder this way.
You know that and I know that. 

18
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,600
I told you last night, I will find him.
I'm going to do that.

19
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,300
Okay?

20
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,500
Now, I want you just to cool out.
I don't want you doing...

21
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,500
- ...anything to upset your pregnancy.
- Look, I don't understand.

22
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,100
You are the Assistant Director.
Who is going over your head on this?

23
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,100
Our brand-new deputy director.

24
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,100
A.D. Skinner, Agent Scully.
Thanks for getting right over.

25
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,700
I don't want to lose any time.

26
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,100
We have one of our own missing...

27
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,600
...and the only acceptable outcome is
that we find him safe and alive.

28
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,000
- I'm sure the two of you agree.
- That goes without saying, sir.

29
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,600
Good.

30
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,600
This comes at a stressful time,
with my new appointment.  

31
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,600
But I'm thankful for your
cooperation in the hunt for Mulder. 

32
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,300
Our cooperation?

33
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,700
With due respect,
there aren't two people better qualified...

34
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,200
...to be directing this action, sir.

35
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,300
Right now, you and A.D. Skinner
are the two primary witnesses...

36
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,000
...to Mulder's disappearance.

37
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,600
I want your statement taken asap. 

38
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,200
You make us out to be suspects, sir. 

39
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,500
Taken by who? 

40
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,700
My task force leader on this,
Special Agent John Doggett.

41
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,500
He's waiting to hear from you now.

42
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,300
One more thing.

43
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,600
Anything leaves this building...

44
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,400
...about aliens or alien abductions...

45
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,200
...or any other nonsense that might cast
the Bureau in a ridiculous light, ...

46
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,200
...hey, you can forget about
looking for Agent Mulder.

47
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,800
You'll both be looking
for new jobs.

48
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,700
That's all.

49
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,500
I don't believe this.

50
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,900
This isn't about finding Mulder--
this is about Kersh covering the FBI's ass.  

51
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,900
Why do I get the feeling they'd be
happy if we never found him at all? 

52
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,300
Look... I saw what I saw.

53
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,200
I have to make a statement in there.
I'm not going to tell them it didn't happen.

54
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,100
Well, you heard Kersh.
They don't want the truth.

55
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,200
You give them the truth,
and they'll hang you with it.

56
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,700
They can hang me with a lie, too.

57
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,100
I'm not going to sell Mulder out.

58
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,400
What good are you to Mulder...

59
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,300
...if you give them the power
to ruin your career?

60
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,700
We will find him.

61
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,000
Assistant Director,
you can come on back with me.

62
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,400
Agent Scully, I'll ask you to please
wait on the wall until we call you.

63
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,100
Water?

64
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,500
It could be a wait.

65
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
Thank you.

66
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,500
- Weren't you his partner? Mulder?
- Yes.

67
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,700
I guess nobody's beyond
suspicion on this thing.

68
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,200
Why are they talking to you? 

69
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,900
Me? I knew Mulder back a bit.  

70
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,700
They're developing a working
profile-- character background.

71
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,000
I'd say they have all the character
profile they need on him.

72
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,900
Certainly his reputation.

73
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,600
I doubt we agents ever really truly
know each other even our partners.

74
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Not at the end of the day.  

75
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Their real lives, their friends, girlfriends,
deeply personal things, issues.

76
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,800
I think I know Mulder as
much as anybody.

77
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,200
Yeah, probably so.

78
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,300
I always took the rumors
with a grain of salt.

79
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,600
- What rumors are those?
- Well, you know.

80
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,500
Well, that, from the beginning he never
felt a real trust with you, ...

81
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,200
...that you were ambitious.

82
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,500
Where'd that come from?

83
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,700
There are women here at the Bureau
that he would confide in.

84
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,900
I don't know if you knew that or not.

85
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
No.

86
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,300
- When was this?
- I don't know, it's just talk.

87
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,500
So, what do you think happened?

88
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,700
To Mulder?
What's your theory?

89
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,100
What's my theory?

90
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,100
My theory is you don't
know Mulder at all.

91
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,300
You never did.

92
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,000
"John Doggett."

93
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,600
Kersh's task force leader.

94
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,200
You might have just
introduced yourself.

95
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Well, I was getting around to it.

96
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,800
Nice to meet you, Agent Doggett. 

97
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,400
<i>Hi, this is Margaret Scully.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

98
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,200
Mom, it's Dana. I, uh...

99
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm sorry I haven't called you
in a while. I've been...

100
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,700
...busy with work and, um,
with something ...  

101
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,800
...else that I should probably
tell you about in person.

102
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,600
I mean, I don't even know if
you're in town or...

103
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,200
...if you're checking your messages.

104
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,900
But, um...

105
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,200
But I really need to see you
and talk to you.

106
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,800
There's a lot of stuff that's going on
with me right now and, um...

107
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,300
...and I just really need to talk.

108
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,600
Mom?

109
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,400
<i>- John Doggett.</i>
- You stay out of my business!

110
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,900
- What? Who is this?
- You better have a court order!

111
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,000
<i>- For what? Who is this?</i>
- How many phones are you tapping?

112
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,800
<i>How many agents are you</i>
<i>doing surveillance on?</i>

113
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,700
Is this Agent Scully?

114
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,400
Thank you. You just answered
all my questions.

115
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Stop there! Right there!

116
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Now come on through the
window nice and easy.

117
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,600
Okay, I'm coming.
It's me, your landlord.

118
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,100
I started fixing the
antennae on the roof, and...

119
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Coeben.
I'm sorry. There was a man.  

120
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,800
There was someone in the building.
Did you see anyone?

121
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,200
Yeah, yeah, you know him,
he works with you.

122
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,100
Tall guy-- brown hair. 

123
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,000
Who?

124
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,500
- You don't mean Mulder?
- Yeah, Mulder.

125
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Mulder?

126
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,100
Are you in here?

127
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,900
- It took some serious voodoo.
- Major satellite hacking.

128
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,300
- But we got your data.
- What am I looking at?

129
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,500
You're seeing real-time images right
off the JPL Topex Poseidon.  

130
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,000
We're wired right into the dish.

131
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,900
We're not able to find raw data
with UFO activity on it.

132
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,700
But Langly was able to hack into
the data storage here...

133
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,000
...and pull up something
just as tasty.

134
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You're looking at UFO activity in the
Pacific Northwest just prior to Mulder's abduction.

135
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,100
All these markers correspond with
reported alien abductions.

136
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,000
- It's a regular shopping spree.
- So Mulder's abduction...

137
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Was a UFO whistle stop on the
way to the next pickup.

138
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,200
Where? Where's the UFO activity
after Mulder's abduction?

139
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,100
Like we said, we can't tell.
Not from the data we're pulling down.

140
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,400
Look, if we can figure out where
that ship was going, ...

141
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,400
...where it was gonna be,
we've got a chance to find Mulder.

142
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,200
- Got a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

143
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,400
- You fly, Agent Doggett?
- Flying is for birds and baseballs. USMC, sir.

144
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,400
In Vietnam we used to fly night
sorties ten feet above the treetops.

145
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,700
Before night vision,
before fly-by-wire.

146
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,600
600 miles an hour and all we had
was an idiot gauge and our wits.

147
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,800
Guys used to say they only knew their
altitude by the smell of the V.C. rice pots.

148
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,200
You've come a long way, sir.

149
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,400
Using all the same instincts.

150
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,200
What can I do for you, Agent?

151
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,300
This task force-- the search for Mulder,
I'm running it, right?

152
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,700
- You're the man in charge.
- No one else is involved?

153
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,700
Someone out there acting under
orders from another office?

154
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,600
I think I'd know, Agent.
What prompts the question?

155
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,100
My idiot gauge. My wits.

156
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,800
You got a chance to shine here, John.

157
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,700
Stand in the spotlight.

158
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,700
Show them all you're an ace.

159
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,400
- What are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same.

160
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,400
- I came by to feed Mulder's fish.
- And then you got tired and decided...

161
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
...to take a nap.

162
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,500
You've got a way about you,
Agent Doggett.

163
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
That might have worked with the NYPD...

164
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,500
...but you're talking to a fellow FBI agent
now and I'd appreciate some respect.

165
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,200
Respect like you showed me
over the phone?

166
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,500
Give a little, get a little, Agent Scully. 

167
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,300
Who ambushed me with the phony chitchat
about Mulder and then...

168
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,000
- ...put a wiretap on my phone?
- That's B.S.

169
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And now you're following me.

170
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,400
I just came by to feed the fish.

171
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,000
What do you want to get on me,
Agent Doggett?

172
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
What is it you hope to find?

173
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm just trying to find Mulder.

174
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,700
You wouldn't know where to look.

175
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,900
It's in the desk, middle drawer.

176
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,500
I know the answer, Agent Scully.

177
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,200
- I don't even know the question.
- What happened to Mulder?

178
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,700
I know what you're gonna say or not
because you think I'm the big bad wolf.

179
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,200
Do you really believe it?

180
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,500
You think by talking in circles,
I'm just going to get dizzy and...

181
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,100
...and blurt it out--
this so-called answer?

182
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,600
- That he was abducted by aliens?
- You said it. I didn't.

183
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,300
I guess I just find it hard
to swallow that a scientist, ...

184
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,600
...a serious person, could buy that.

185
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,700
Ever see an alien, Agent Scully?

186
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,900
You want me to go on record?

187
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,900
I will go on record to say this:

188
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,200
that I have seen things
that I cannot explain.

189
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,200
I have observed phenomena
that I cannot deny.

190
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,100
And that as a scientist and
a serious person...

191
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,800
...it is a badge of honor not
to dismiss these things...

192
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,900
...because someone thinks
they're B.S.

193
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,400
So you think he was abducted?

194
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,700
- I'm just trying to find him.
- Then what are you doing here?

195
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,300
Trying to figure these out.

196
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,600
I found them in his desk there.

197
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,000
Car rental receipts on
Agent Mulder's Visa.

198
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,600
Four consecutive weekends in May.
Same mileage each trip--

199
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,300
370 miles, 375 miles...

200
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,800
Where was he going?

201
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,800
I don't know.

202
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,700
Like I said, maybe you really
didn't know your partner.

203
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,000
John Doggett.

204
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,000
Agent Mulder at the FBI?

205
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,100
Assistant Director, follow me.

206
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,000
- What's going on?  What is this?
- Mr. Skinner, right this way, please.

207
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,500
You can talk with Agent
Scully after we're done.

208
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
Have a seat.

209
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,200
Assistant Director, someone came into this office
after hours and removed some material.

210
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,000
Files. We don't know exactly
what just yet.

211
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,400
Who?

212
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,300
The office here is secured by a pass-card lock...

213
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,700
...and whoever came in last night used
the pass-card belonging to Agent Mulder.

214
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,600
You think Agent Mulder took the files?

215
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,800
We're wondering about
Agent Mulder's state of mind.

216
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,800
In your statement,
you said prior to his disappearance...

217
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,100
...Agent Mulder had felt
threatened by the FBI.

218
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,400
No, that's not what I said.

219
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,900
I said he felt the X-Files were
threatened by budget cutting.

220
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:21,800
Is there anything you're not telling us
about Agent Mulder or his attitude?

221
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,200
Do you think he'd ever
retaliate against the FBI?

222
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:34,500
- Agent Mulder was only after the truth.
- As are we, Assistant Director.

223
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,300
Agent Scully tells us
she was home last night.

224
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:45,700
We see from your phone log,
you were here until at least after 10:00.

225
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,100
You think I came in here last night
using Agent Mulder's pass-card?

226
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,600
You were the last person to
see Mulder.

227
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,500
You and Agent Scully.

228
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,000
Skinner is telling the truth.

229
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,800
I believe him.

230
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,200
That still doesn't tell us who
used Mulder's card to get in there.

231
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,300
You think it was Mulder?

232
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,900
I showed you those car
rental receipts.

233
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,500
Well, now I find Agent Mulder's Visa was used
two days ago in Raleigh, North Carolina.

234
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:55,400
Two days ago?
By who? For what?

235
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:01,000
Flowers. Automatic debit to
a mortuary there.

236
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,600
Mulder's mother is buried
in Raleigh.

237
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,100
That's the reason he was
going every weekend.

238
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,500
It's one reason.

239
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,400
I don't know what to think.

240
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,700
I don't believe it, Dana.
It just doesn't make any sense to me.

241
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,700
All right.

242
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,000
I got some light on this.

243
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,800
Maybe you can help me out here,
Agent Scully.

244
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,700
What is it?

245
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,800
Agent Mulder's medical records--
recent stuff, over the last year.

246
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,800
Did you know about a medical
condition? Either of you?

247
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,700
No.

248
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,900
A year ago, Agent Mulder was
hospitalized. Ring a bell?

249
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,900
Something to do with his brain?

250
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,900
- His temporal lobe.
- An undiagnosable condition, it says.

251
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,100
Irregular brain activity.

252
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,500
All right, but he recovered.
There was a full recovery.

253
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,600
Was there? 

254
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,700
You know Mulder; he would've
told us if there was anything.

255
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,200
Would he?

256
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,600
Would he tell you about this?
About his headstone?

257
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Mulder was dying.

258
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,500
- What?
- It's all right here.

259
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:47,500
For a year, he was going to doctors.
There's a clear record of his decline.

260
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,800
How well did you really know him?

261
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,000
- How far would Mulder go?
- How far would he go for what?

262
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,300
The truth-- his truth.

263
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:06,600
Whatever it was he was trying to prove,
how bad did he need to prove it?

264
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,100
- It was his whole life.
- What are you trying to say?

265
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,000
That Agent Mulder found himself
in a place none of us want to go.

266
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,100
Life-threatened, work-threatened,
and all for naught.

267
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,600
Nothing proven.

268
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,000
The effort in vain.
No mark left.

269
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,700
Unless he rolled the dice,
took one big last chance to make it.

270
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,200
You think that Mulder was here?

271
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,500
That he broke in to
steal those files?

272
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,000
Broke into your apartment;
stole your computer.

273
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,300
Took his own computer.
Gathering it up.

274
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,400
To what?
To prove it?

275
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Or cover it up.
Create doubt.

276
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,100
I get Mulder, I get him.

277
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,600
I understand obsession,
believe me.

278
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,900
But the question is:
how far would he go?

279
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,600
I mean, so far as to stage his
own disappearance?

280
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,700
I know what I saw.

281
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,100
I not going to sit here
and listen to this.

282
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,800
I watched it happen.

283
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,500
Agent Mulder?!

284
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,300
Please don't report that.

285
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,400
Don't know what good it
would do me.

286
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,600
Doesn't help me find Mulder.

287
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,500
No, it's not good enough.

288
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,300
These are records of
microburst activity.

289
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,300
What we read is UFO activity
since Mulder's abduction.

290
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,500
- I think this is a waste of time.
- No, it's not. Just look at them. 

291
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,700
I'm looking, and what I'm seeing is
activity all over the southwestern states.

292
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,400
That's right.

293
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,000
Mulder disappeared in the
Pacific Northwest.

294
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And if Mulder is on that ship,
this is where he is now.

295
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,600
Here?
In the Arizona desert?

296
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,600
This is what we have.

297
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,700
Okay. Say this is true...

298
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,700
Then how do we even
begin to start finding him?

299
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:19,800
Maybe with whoever it is they're
looking to abduct next.

300
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,500
- Hey, we're only trying to help.
- We're only trying to find Mulder.

301
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,900
That's it.

302
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,200
- It just came to me.
- What?

303
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,400
What you saw,
why they took Mulder, ...

304
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,800
...why they're in Arizona now--
it all makes sense.

305
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,700
<i>Why do people refuse to believe</i>
<i>in aliens and UFOs...</i>

306
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,400
<i>...after all these years of sightings</i>
<i>and eyewitness accounts?</i>

307
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,000
<i>- Why?</i>
- Because there's no real proof.

308
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,600
Because, maybe, if there are aliens
they're simply going around...

309
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,900
...and they're... and they're removing
all of the evidence before it becomes proof.

310
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,700
<i>This isn't Mulder who's going around</i>
<i>and collecting this stuff. It's them.</i>

311
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,500
<i>Then why Arizona?</i>

312
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,300
Because they are looking to find that
which is not in my computer...

313
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,700
...or Mulder's computer or in the files
that were removed from the FBI.

314
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,800
They are looking to find the whereabouts
of good, hard proof.

315
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,600
<i>That in this case exists in a person, ...</i>

316
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,800
<i>...in a boy named Gibson Praise.</i>

317
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,100
This photograph's a few years old
but take a good look because...

318
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:59,100
...the objective in this case
has been reframed.

319
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,000
Subject's name is Gibson Andrew Praise.

320
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,500
A child prodigy, pint-sized chess
champion who Mulder and Scully...

321
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:12,400
...first investigated in 1997 after
a failed attempt on the boy's life.

322
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,900
His files were the ones we now believe
were stolen from this office.

323
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,800
In his investigation Agent Mulder
came to believe the boy...

324
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,700
...was experiencing abnormal
brain activity.

325
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,500
Unexplained activity.

326
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,400
In his field notes here he says
Gibson Praise could, and I quote:

327
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,000
"read people's thoughts."

328
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,200
Agent Mulder went so far in one
report to claim...

329
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,100
...that the boy may have
alien physiology.

330
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:49,500
Agent Mulder may be looking for the boy
who was last seen in Arizona.

331
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:55,100
So maybe to find Mulder we first have
to look for Gibson Praise.

332
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,400
Let's go, people!
Let's move!

333
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,000
How do you want this handled?

334
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,800
I want you to put that
on every TV station, ...

335
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,400
...post office, and fax machine
in Arizona and the southwest.

336
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,000
I want to make that face famous.

337
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,500
You better?

338
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,600
I need some navigation.

339
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,500
How to start looking for a 12-year-old kid
in the middle of the Arizona desert.

340
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,400
Well, there aren't a whole
lot of choices.

341
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,700
We got a turn off coming up in five miles.
I take it or keep going straight?

342
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,900
Gibson Praise was last seen here...

343
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,900
...at a power plant about
60 miles outside of Phoenix.

344
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:50,300
But all the satellite data shows activity
here about 100 miles to the north.

345
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,300
What's out there?  

346
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,600
Well, according to this map...

347
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,600
...a whole lot of nothing.

348
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,200
<i>This is Special Agent Crane</i>
<i>calling for task force leader.</i>

349
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,500
Yeah, this is John Doggett.

350
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,700
<i>Just confirmed a location</i>
<i>on this kid.</i>

351
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,100
He's at a school for the deaf
in a place called Flemingtown.

352
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,400
<i>Little dot on the map about</i>
<i>90 miles from where I am now.</i>

353
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,300
I just talked to the school
principal there.

354
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,000
- Is the kid in school now?
- Yeah, he lives at the school.

355
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,300
All right, have the principal
take him out of class and...

356
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,100
...put him someplace where he can
keep an eye on him until we arrive.

357
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,000
Got it. Gonna take me an hour,
an hour and 15 to get there.

358
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,400
All right, well, I'm going to see
if I can cut some time off that.

359
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,300
It's a school 20 minutes from here.

360
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,800
Yes, sir, in his science class.

361
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,200
Is it important enough to take
him away from his studies?

362
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,300
I'll go and get him
right now.

363
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,800
FLEMINGTOWN
School for the Deaf

364
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,400
Where's the boy?

365
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,700
You're just going to have to slow down and
explain a few things to us before we let you...

366
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,800
- Is he down there?
- He's in my office.

367
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,000
Hi. Um ... we're looking for a
boy named Gibson Praise.

368
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,700
- Now who are you?
- Kid went out the window.

369
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,300
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?!

370
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,500
Trying to find Mulder.

371
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,000
Kid's on the move.
Spread out!

372
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:49,500
The kid's on the loose!
You have the photo! Move!

373
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,600
Let me go!

374
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,800
Let me go!

375
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,300
Let the boy go!

376
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,400
Let him go, Mulder!

377
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,900
