Apparently he had a history.
He'd been cited for drinking on duty.

00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,946

to some kind of chemical refrigerant...

like liquid nitrogen,
possible even ingested it.

I don't know what else to say, Mulder,
except that what this doesn't do...

109
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:33,832
is add any credence to the suspect's
alibi that the old man was on the scene.

110
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,834

if he can explain this.

and blame me for that one too?

If my interpretation of
certain data was a little lax,

138

by a small gauge hypodermic needle.

Lisa, you can tell us now, or we can
subpoena your testimony in court.

229
00:15:51,264 --> 00:15:53,323
Either way, we'll find out
what you know about it.

230
00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:58,562
It's a kind of catalyst.

231
00:15:58,638 --> 00:16:03,337
-A catalyst for what?
-A self-sustaining endothermic reaction.

232
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:05,376
It's a rapid freezing agent.

233
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:08,379
Something Jason’s been
engineering for years.

234
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:13,248
See, when a cell freezes,
its moisture forms into ice crystals,

235
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:16,584
which literally grind up
the cell from the inside out.

236
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:21,787
But extreme rapid freezing causes a
smoother, glass-like structure to form,

237
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:24,193
so the cell can survive
being thawed,

238
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:28,290
at least according
to Jason’s theory.

239
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:31,336
This compound, has Jason
actually tested it yet?

240
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:35,500
He hasn't tested it yet because it
doesn't exist, except in the computer.

241
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:39,908
So far the work's been limited to
generating virtual chemicals, like this.

242
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:44,040
In fact, what we're looking there is a
version of the catalyst you brought me.

243
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:48,951
Is it possible he could have synthesized
the compound without you knowing it?

244
00:16:49,021 --> 00:16:50,955
Not even remotely.

245
00:16:51,023 --> 00:16:55,858
Technology to engineer something
like that is still five, ten years away.

246

- What are you talking about?
