00:31:59,197 --> 00:32:02,223
No one had seen burns
like these before,

331
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,791
but a lot of us began to suspect they
had something to do with the planes...

332
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:06,803
that we’d been
sent to recover.

333
00:32:06,871 --> 00:32:10,204
The men were all
frightened of dying.

334
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:13,972
As the X.O., I urged the captain
to return to port,

335
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:18,140
but against all reason and good sense,
he refused to leave the area.

336
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,184
Captain Sanford ?

337
00:32:20,252 --> 00:32:24,985
I'm not an M.D., but I know
a lost cause when I see one.

338
00:32:25,056 --> 00:32:28,423
These men are all dying, and there's
nothing that I can do to stop it.

339
00:32:28,493 --> 00:32:31,018
just do your damn job.

340
00:32:31,096 --> 00:32:34,395
Sir, I'm trying, but if we stay
down here any longer,

341
00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:36,661
none of us
are going home.

342
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:47,339
You're the X.O.
You've gotta get us to the surface.

343
00:32:47,445 --> 00:32:50,107
- We are under the captain's orders.
- He's losing his mind.

344
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:52,149
The Japanese
are shadowing us.

345
00:32:52,217 --> 00:32:54,685
That destroyer is doing
wide circles above our position.

346
00:32:54,753 --> 00:32:56,812
You have to take control
of this sub, sir.

347
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:59,789
You have to
make a decision.

348

We're all gonna die !

349
00:33:02,027 --> 00:33:05,224

We're dying !
Can't you all see that ?

351
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:09,692
You've gotta get us
out of here !

352
00:33:17,475 --> 00:33:21,502
[Johansen Narrating]Our silence
had been shattered by the gunshot.

353
00:33:21,613 --> 00:33:24,514
The only command that could save
us from the Japanese destroyer now...

354
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:26,446
was the command
to return home,

355
00:33:26,518 --> 00:33:29,715
an order I knew the captain
would never issue.

356
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:31,779
Johansen !

357
00:33:31,856 --> 00:33:34,154

-[Banging On Door]
- Open this door! Johansen!

359
00:33:37,595 --> 00:33:41,429
[Johansen Narrating]I knew mutiny
was our only chance for survival.

360
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:45,265
But I also knew,
by sealing that door,

361
00:33:45,337 --> 00:33:49,398
I was sealing the fate
of the men locked behind it.

362
00:33:54,646 --> 00:33:59,549
By luck or the grace of God,
we made it to Pearl Harbor.

363
00:33:59,617 --> 00:34:03,075
What happened to Sanford
and the sick crewmen ?

364
00:34:03,154 --> 00:34:06,920
When they opened that door,
those that were not dead were dying.

365
00:34:06,991 --> 00:34:10,324
There were 1 44 men
on that boat.

366
00:34:10,395 --> 00:34:13,728
Only seven of us survived.

367
00:34:13,798 --> 00:34:18,098
Whatever killed them,
I was allowed to live,

368
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:21,366
to raise a family,
to grow old.

369
00:34:21,439 --> 00:34:25,773

ever got an explanation why.

It's a bull market, hon, and I'm

Mustang you sold the French government ?

377
00:35:17,028 --> 00:35:21,465
- Why should I tell you ?
- Actually, I'd rather know
who sold you the secrets.

378

A thin slice off the top.

380

It'd be bad business
to divulge my sources.

381
00:35:30,341 --> 00:35:33,037
- Why'd you run off to Hong Kong ?
- To meet with the buyer.

- To sell him what ?
- Pardon your gender type.

383

- Oh, your buyer's a woman.
- Actually, you know, it's
none of your damn business.

it is my damn business,
because whatever it is you're selling...

in a California hospital,

which is why
I'm gonna arrest you.

This is Hong Kong,

389

They don't allow
handguns here.

390

They took yours away
at the airport.

Hey ! Hey,
you can't do that !

You're violating

You gave up your civil rights
when you committed treason.

395
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:18,946
You can't force me
to do anything.

When guns are outlawed--

Why don’t you take that gun
