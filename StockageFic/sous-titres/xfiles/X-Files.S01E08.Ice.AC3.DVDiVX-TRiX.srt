00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:34,396
we are.

We're not...

who we are.

00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:53,556

Mulder: This team ofscientists
made up the Arctic lce Core Project.

19
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:29,246
Theywere sent to Alaska

20
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:32,410
by the government's advanced research
project agency

21
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:35,318
nearly a year ago to drill
into the arctic ice.

22
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:36,855
The samples they removed

23
00:04:36,923 --> 00:04:39,414
contained trapped gases, dust,
chemicals--

24
00:04:39,492 --> 00:04:40,982
Evidence that could reveal

25
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:43,188
the structure ofthe Earth's climate

26
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:45,059
back to the dawn ofman.

27
00:04:45,165 --> 00:04:47,292
Theirworkwas a success,
nearly completed.

28
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,494
No reports or indications
ofproblems ofany kind

29
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,037
until only a week later

30
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:54,335
this next transmission was received.

(Groan)

40
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:35,277
What happened up there?

41
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:36,679
Nobody's been able

42
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,617
to reach the compound
because ofbad weather.

43
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:41,017
Obviously they think

44
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:43,078
we're either brilliant or expendable

45
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:45,283
because we've pulled the assignment.

46
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:47,349
ls it severe isolation distress?

47
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:49,088
These were top geophysicists.

48
00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:51,857
Theywere trained and screened
for this project

49
00:05:51,965 --> 00:05:55,059
in everyway imaginable,
including psychological makeup.

50
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:56,635
We leave for Nome today.

51
00:05:56,703 --> 00:05:58,466
We'll meet up
with three scientists

52
00:05:58,538 --> 00:06:00,369
familiarwith the project

53
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,739
and then head north
up to the lcy Cape.

54
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,109
The National Weather Service
reports a three-daywindow

55
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,445
to get in and get out
before the next arctic storm.

56
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:12,041
Bring your mittens.

57
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:19,786
Radio:Fouts looks over

Touchdown!

62
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:30,069
Fouts is God!

63
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:36,635
Sorry. My team scored.

64
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,735
There's no football on Wednesday.

65
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:41,679
Fouts retired in '87,
didn't he?

66
00:06:41,748 --> 00:06:44,911
This is some ofmy all-time
favorite plays on tape.

67
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:46,383
You two F.B.l.?

68
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:48,751
Agent Mulder, Agent Scully. And you?

69
00:06:48,822 --> 00:06:49,846
Danny Murphy.

70
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:51,481
Professor ofgeology, U.C. San Diego.

71
00:06:51,558 --> 00:06:54,584
You get much ofa chance
to study ice down there?

72
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:55,992
just what's around the keg.

73
00:06:58,298 --> 00:07:00,732
Dr. DaSilva?
Dr. Hodge?

74
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,267
Agent Scully, Agent Mulder.

75
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:03,596
Nice to meetyou.

76
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,604
Howyou doing?

77
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:07,640
Can l see some identification?

78
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:08,901
What for?

79
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:11,603
l just want to make sure
we are who we saywe are.

80
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:18,281
lt's me.

81
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:19,750
lt's you.

82
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:21,150
lt's me.

83
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:22,711
lt's you.

84
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:24,313
- lt's me.
- Thanks a lot.

85
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,550
Appreciate it.

86
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,217
lt's you.

87
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:29,284
Well, now that we know who we are

88
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:30,794
anybody care to take a guess

89
00:07:30,864 --> 00:07:33,264
as to whywe're going?

90
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,198
Two agents, a geologist,
a medical doctor

91
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:36,667
and a toxicologist.

92
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:39,170
That should give us some idea.

93
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:42,174
l assumeyou all
took a look at the tape.

94
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:46,712
Something wrong?

95
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,543
Come on. You're F.B.l.

96
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:50,810
You have to know
more than we do.

97
00:07:58,057 --> 00:07:59,991
You folks the ones
going up to lcy Cape?

98
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:01,287
Yeah.

99
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:04,329
Then l'm fying you.
My name is Bear.

100
00:08:04,397 --> 00:08:06,331
The plane's across the way.

101
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,333
Provisions are loaded.
Grabyour gear.

102
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:10,335
Oh, could we see
some credentials?

103
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,963
Credentials.

104
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,565
The only credentials l have

105
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:19,846
is that l'm the only pilot
willing to fyyou up there.

106
00:08:19,846 --> 00:08:20,437
is that l'm the only pilot
willing to fyyou up there.

107
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:23,073
You don't like
those credentials...

108
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:25,447
walk.

109
00:08:53,012 --> 00:08:58,279
Bear... see ifyou
can get the power started.

110
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:01,320
Anything to get out ofhere.

111
00:09:05,158 --> 00:09:07,592
Where do we start?

112
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,651
Body bags are on the plane.

113
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:11,423
Before we touch anything

114
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:14,295
we have to thoroughly
document the scene.

115
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:24,776
Scully: Flashing.

116
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:41,889
Mulder: That's what
theywere drilling for.

117
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:46,097
Quarter ofa million years
melting away

118
00:09:46,165 --> 00:09:48,099
in a couple ofdays.

119
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:50,635
l want to preserve
some samples.

120
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,754
(Rumbling)

121
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:14,520
lt's the generator.

122
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:16,424
Oh.

123
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:29,905
Agent Mulder...

124
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:33,207
(Screaming)

125
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:37,208
(Barking)

126
00:10:40,954 --> 00:10:43,081
Hold on.

127
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:46,257
(Groans)

128
00:10:50,863 --> 00:10:52,353
Hold it down.

129
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:01,938
That will keep him
out for awhile.

130
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,272
You okay?

131
00:11:08,348 --> 00:11:09,940
Yeah, he didn't break the skin.

132
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:11,244
Bear, you okay?

133
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:12,784
He got me.

134
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:14,342
Get thatjacket off.

135
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,615
Give me the stuff.
l'll do it myself.

136
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:18,680
DaSilva: ls it rabies?

137
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:28,800
l don't see any indications.

138
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:30,426
lfit is rabies

139
00:11:30,536 --> 00:11:33,471
it's certainly not a strain
l'm familiarwith.

140
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:36,099
Scully:
Look at this. Black nodules.

141
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:37,836
Swollen lymph nodes.

142
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,276
Symptoms ofbubonic plague.

143
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:43,713
l'll do a blood test.
We'll take it from there.

144
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:45,808
This dog has got

145
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:49,514
a skin irritation
on its neck.

146
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:51,955
Murphy: lt looks like
it's been scratching off

147
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:53,583
its own hair.

148
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:55,627
Look at this.
Look at this!

149
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:02,058
What the hell was that?

150
00:12:11,544 --> 00:12:13,444
(Groans)

151
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:45,571
From the autopsies

152
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:48,409
it's clear these men
killed one another.

153
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:49,709
There are contusions

154
00:12:49,782 --> 00:12:51,977
around the throat areas
ofthree men--

155
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:53,746
evidence ofstrangulation.

156
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,415
Richter and Campbell
killed themselves.

157
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,924
l also found tissue damage
due to fever.

158
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:02,483
Did any ofthem have

159
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:05,360
the black spots the dog has?

160
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:08,366
No. None ofthem had
the black nodules.

161
00:13:08,468 --> 00:13:11,699
So, uh, those spots
didn't have anything to do

162
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:14,238
with those guys
killing each other, right?

163
00:13:14,307 --> 00:13:15,672
l wouldn't rule it out.

164
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:17,368
l just reexamined the dog.

165
00:13:17,443 --> 00:13:18,842
The nodules are gone.

166
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:20,276
What could that mean?

167
00:13:20,346 --> 00:13:23,838
lt could mean that the spots
are a symptom ofsome disease

168
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,508
at an early stage.

169
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:56,080
Danny?

170
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:59,084
Danny.

171
00:13:59,152 --> 00:14:00,517
Danny.

172
00:14:00,586 --> 00:14:02,019
Sorry.

173
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:04,215
The play-offgame
against Miami, '82.

174
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,053
Helps to get my mind offstuff.

175
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:09,185
My interpretation of
satellite remote sensing photos

176
00:14:09,262 --> 00:14:10,422
is a little rusty.

177
00:14:10,496 --> 00:14:14,330
Murphy: All right,
this is the lcy Cape area.

178
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:16,060
lt approximates

179
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:17,397
the depth ofthe ice sheet

180
00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:19,403
to be about 3,000 meters thick.

181
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:20,666
l also found this data

182
00:14:20,773 --> 00:14:22,604
and ifl'm reading it correctly

183
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:24,905
the team actually found
the ice sheet

184
00:14:24,977 --> 00:14:26,342
to be twice that depth.

185
00:14:26,412 --> 00:14:27,572
That's very good.

186
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:28,739
The numbers indicate

187
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:30,281
the topography to be concave.

188
00:14:30,349 --> 00:14:31,941
Looks like theywere drilling

189
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:33,315
inside a meteor crater.

190
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:36,116
Hodge: No, you're wrong.

191
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:38,214
l analyzed two samples.

192
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,054
What did you find?

193
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:42,185
There's a presence
ofammonium hydroxide

194
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:44,195
in Richter's blood sample.

195
00:14:44,263 --> 00:14:46,026
lt's not possible.

196
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:48,589
Ammonia would vaporize
at human body temperature.

197
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:50,430
l checked all
the air filtration systems.

198
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:52,868
l found no evidence
ofany such toxins.

199
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:54,634
l have.

200
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:58,074
ln the ice,
and that's not all there is.

201
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:03,681
l found a high ratio
ofammonia to water

202
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:05,683
in the ice core.

203
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:07,844
The earth's atmosphere could
never have produced such levels

204
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,683
even a quarter
ofa million years ago.

205
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:11,086
Look in the scope.

206
00:15:11,157 --> 00:15:13,091
Unless a foreign object

207
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,286
was introduced
into that environment.

208
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:18,228
Murphy: Tell me
that's not a foreign object.

209
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:20,231
Scully.

210
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:27,170
That same thing is
in Richter's blood.

211
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:30,341
What ifthat single-celled organism

212
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:33,537
is the larval stage
ofa larger animal?

213
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:38,382
That's kind ofa leap,
don'tyou think?

214
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:40,544
Scully:
The evidence is there.

215
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,053
Maybe the organism

216
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:44,248
in the ice core
somehow got into the men.

217
00:15:44,323 --> 00:15:46,291
Come on.
Nothing can survive

218
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:48,384
in sub-zero temperatures
for a quarter million years.

219
00:15:48,461 --> 00:15:51,021
Mulder:
Unless that's how it lives.

220
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:55,329
Why areyou squabbling
over some bug?

221
00:15:55,434 --> 00:15:57,163
You said ityourself, Scully.

222
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,101
Your autopsy found
those men killed each other.

223
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:02,197
That's it.
Let'sjust get the hell out ofhere.

224
00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:03,741
l agree.

225
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:05,743
We'll send the bodies
to a facility

226
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:08,302
where they can make
a definitive diagnosis.

227
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:11,782
ln the event that something
was missed, Agent Scully.

228
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:14,319
lfthose bodies are infected

229
00:16:14,387 --> 00:16:16,651
we can't take them back.

230
00:16:16,722 --> 00:16:18,747
We can't go back
without proper quarantine procedures.

231
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:20,724
We can't risk bringing back
the next plague.

232
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:23,455
Let's say
they came down with something.

233
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:26,965
We haven't, and l ain't
waiting around until we do.

234
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:29,729
l think it's safe to go back.

235
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:31,769
There's no reason
whywe'd be infected.

236
00:16:31,837 --> 00:16:33,668
We took the necessary safeguards.

237
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:35,070
The dog did bite Bear.

238
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:36,608
ltjumped Mulder!

239
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:38,974
There's only one way to proceed.

240
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:41,147
A doctor eliminates
every possibility.

241
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,147
We must determine
ifany ofus is infected.

242
00:16:48,054 --> 00:16:50,420
All right.
Parasitic diagnostic procedure

243
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:54,323
requires that each ofus provide
a blood and a stool sample.

244
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:56,554
A stool sample?

245
00:16:56,662 --> 00:16:59,825
This kind oftravel
always makes that tough... for me.

246
00:16:59,932 --> 00:17:02,492
Mulder:
Anybody got the morning

247
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:04,262
sports section handy?

248
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:08,870
l ain't dropping my cargo
for no one.

249
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:10,602
What l'm doing is getting

250
00:17:10,676 --> 00:17:11,608
my gear, my plane

251
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:13,542
and fying the hell out ofhere.

252
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:16,172
You can't go.
The dog bityou.

253
00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:20,548
l got hired to fyyou up here
and fyyou back.

254
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,746
No one said this might be
part ofthe deal.

255
00:17:22,822 --> 00:17:25,086
So the deal is over.

256
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:28,961
Scully: We can't let him leave
without being checked.

257
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:29,518
Scully: We can't let him leave
without being checked.

258
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:31,858
Who's going to stop him?

259
00:17:31,964 --> 00:17:33,556
We have to.

260
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,430
We can't risk infecting
the population.

261
00:17:36,502 --> 00:17:38,436
lfhe gets on that plane,
l will too.

262
00:17:38,504 --> 00:17:39,971
There's no time to argue.

263
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,472
Take a vote.

264
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,474
Who believes
we should confine Bear

265
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:45,373
until he agrees
to an examination?

266
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:53,814
All right.

267
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:58,489
Bear, wejust want
to checkyou out.

268
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:00,081
lfwe don't find any trace

269
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:01,751
ofthe parasite or the virus

270
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:03,089
we'll all go.

271
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:13,103
All right.

272
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:16,107
Give me the damnjar.

273
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:29,577
Murphy, get a rope.

274
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:31,589
(Bear Grunting)

275
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:36,257
(Groaning)

276
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:40,592
Oh, my God!

277
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:42,166
(Groaning)

278
00:18:42,268 --> 00:18:43,701
Oh!

279
00:18:44,703 --> 00:18:46,330
Get my bag.

280
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:47,531
What areyou gonna do?

281
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:48,766
Cutting it out.

282
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:50,274
We know nothing about it.

283
00:18:50,342 --> 00:18:51,707
lt's killing him.

284
00:18:51,777 --> 00:18:53,802
Scully, help me hold the skin.

285
00:18:57,616 --> 00:18:59,948
Hold still, Bear.

286
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:02,010
(Screaming)

287
00:19:02,087 --> 00:19:04,282
Forceps.

288
00:19:04,356 --> 00:19:05,653
(Moaning)

289
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,328
Hodge: Hold still, Bear.

290
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:11,624
just another second.

291
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,459
You're going to be okay.

292
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:17,229
(Groaning)

293
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:20,830
(Agonized Moaning)

294
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:42,084
This is the A.l.C.P.
investigative team

295
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:44,129
calling Doolittle Airfield.
Come in.

296
00:19:44,196 --> 00:19:45,925
D.A.F. responding.

297
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:47,999
This is Agent Mulder.

298
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:50,934
We have a serious
biological hazard.

299
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:53,938
Request air pickup
and quarantine procedures.

300
00:19:54,006 --> 00:19:56,907
Come in, Doolittle Airfield.

301
00:19:56,976 --> 00:19:59,706
We copy.
Thisareais underaheavystorm.

302
00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:01,973
Noaircraftcangetout

303

Maybe themilitarybasein Kotzebue

304
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,884
Adviseimmediate evacuation.

305
00:20:06,952 --> 00:20:09,250
Thestorm isbearing
inyour direction.

306
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:11,846
We were told
we'd have three clear days ofweather.

307
00:20:11,924 --> 00:20:15,223
Welcome to the top
ofthe world, sir.

308
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:17,261
ls Bear in any condition to fy?

309
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:19,126
lfwe don't get out ofhere
in an hour

310
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:21,165
we don't get out for days.

311
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:26,771
He's dead.

312
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:46,857
Hodge: lt's similar to a tapeworm

313
00:20:46,926 --> 00:20:49,622
in that it has a scolex
with suckers and hooks.

314
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:51,662
You can deal with it?

315
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,664
What?

316
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:55,165
No.

317
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:56,997
Very different
from any organism--

318
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:58,832
at least that l know of.

319
00:20:58,904 --> 00:21:01,429
Haveyou figured out
how it's transmitted yet?

320
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:04,271
Exchange offuids, touch, air,
all ofthe above?

321
00:21:04,343 --> 00:21:05,776
l don't know.

322
00:21:05,844 --> 00:21:07,778
All the other dead bodies
had the creature.

323
00:21:07,846 --> 00:21:09,780
This is the only one
that's still alive.

324
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:11,611
Were they all in the spine?

325
00:21:11,684 --> 00:21:15,176
No. lt appears theywere
in the hypothalamus gland

326
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:17,119
deep in the brain.

327
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:19,123
Murphy: Hypothalamus.

328
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:21,091
What was that again?

329
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,128
lt's a gland
that secretes hormones

330
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:25,129
although l don't know why

331
00:21:25,197 --> 00:21:27,256
a parasite would want
to attach to it.

332
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:30,130
Hypothalamus releases acetylcholine

333
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:33,399
which is what produces
violent, aggressive behavior.

334
00:21:33,472 --> 00:21:35,406
That might be a connection.

335
00:21:35,474 --> 00:21:37,237
Everybody that's been infected

336
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:40,142
certainly seems
to act aggressively.

337
00:21:40,212 --> 00:21:42,874
Maybe the worm feeds
on acetylcholine

338
00:21:42,948 --> 00:21:45,246
which foods our capacity
to control violent behavior.

339
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:47,717
A parasite shouldn't want
to kill its host.

340
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:50,448
lt doesn't kill you
until it's extracted.

341
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:52,547
Then it releases a poison.

342
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,183
You're saying it's possible

343
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:57,126
the worm makes you
want to kill other people

344
00:21:57,229 --> 00:21:59,288
which is maybe what happened
to the first team.

345
00:21:59,398 --> 00:22:01,866
Orwhat could happen to us.

346
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:04,198
lt'sjust a theory.
We don't have definite proof.

347
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:06,203
Except five dead men.

348
00:22:06,271 --> 00:22:08,535
lfthe worm makes people
violently aggressive

349
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:11,974
then why did Richter
and Campbell kill themselves?

350
00:22:12,044 --> 00:22:15,980
Maybe they did it
to save us.

351
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:35,195
l'm just, uh...
double-checking.

352
00:22:35,267 --> 00:22:37,326
Making sure l didn't miss anything.

353
00:22:37,436 --> 00:22:40,837
just some sleep, right?

354
00:22:40,906 --> 00:22:44,342
Sleep. l'm so tired,
l can't sleep.

355
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,674
We're all wired
and hypersensitive.

356
00:22:46,745 --> 00:22:49,179
lt will be good to get
a fresh start in the morning.

357
00:22:49,248 --> 00:22:51,182
l don't want to waste a second

358
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,184
finding a way to kill this thing.

359
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:56,278
l don't know
ifwe should kill it.

360
00:22:56,355 --> 00:22:59,882
This area ofthe ice sheet
is formed over a meteor crater.

361
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:01,858
The worm lives in ammonia.

362
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,190
lt survives sub-zero temperatures.

363
00:23:04,296 --> 00:23:06,856
Theorists in alternative life designs
believe in

364
00:23:06,965 --> 00:23:09,627
ammonia-supported life systems
on planets with freezing...

365
00:23:09,702 --> 00:23:10,794
No.

366
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:12,894
The meteor that crashed here

367
00:23:12,971 --> 00:23:16,065
may have carried that type
oflife to earth.

368
00:23:16,141 --> 00:23:18,769
Mulder, that pilot
developed surface symptoms

369
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:20,937
within a few minutes.

370
00:23:21,013 --> 00:23:24,915
Within a few hours
that parasite had total control.

371
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:28,578
What would happen
ifthis got into the population?

372
00:23:28,654 --> 00:23:30,781
A city the size of New York

373
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:33,825
could be infected
within a few days.

374
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:37,350
Exactly.
But what do we know about it?

375
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:39,488
This organism might be
lying dormant in another crater.

376
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:42,863
lfwe don't kill it now,
we run the risk

377
00:23:42,935 --> 00:23:45,563
ofbecoming Richter and Campbell
with guns to our heads.

378
00:23:45,637 --> 00:23:47,901
lfwe kill it, we won't know

379
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:49,964
how to stop anything like it
in the future.

380
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:51,976
Scully: Future!

381
00:23:52,044 --> 00:23:55,639
(lndistinct Arguing)

382
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:03,521
Tell me it's hot in here.

383
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:05,523
Don't worry.
You don't have a fever.

384
00:24:05,591 --> 00:24:07,650
Heating system's malfunctioning.

385
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:11,321
Outside, it's 40 below,
and in here it's sweltering.

386
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,489
Can you hear
what they're arguing about?

387
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:16,568
They're probably discussing
their little government secrets.

388
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:19,569
You think they knew what was here
before we arrived?

389
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:21,469
l'm sure ofit.

390
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,735
Scully:
...biological hazard.

391
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:27,336
You know, Bear's infected blood
did get on Scully.

392
00:24:27,412 --> 00:24:29,903
lt also got on you.

393
00:24:37,256 --> 00:24:39,349
How doyou know
it can't be contained?

394
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,324
lt can!
By extermination.

395
00:24:41,393 --> 00:24:42,985
We should take
those bodies--

396
00:24:43,095 --> 00:24:45,655
worms and all--
outside and incinerate them.

397
00:24:45,764 --> 00:24:48,130
Something going on
we should know about?

398
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,134
Agent Scully, you all right?

399
00:24:50,202 --> 00:24:52,636
Yes, l'm fine.
lt's nothing.

400
00:24:52,704 --> 00:24:55,434
You seem a little stressed out.

401
00:24:57,609 --> 00:24:59,406
What the hell
areyou saying?

402
00:24:59,478 --> 00:25:00,775
Let's all settle down.

403
00:25:00,846 --> 00:25:02,040
lt's been a hard day.

404
00:25:02,114 --> 00:25:03,672
We're all tired and scared.

405
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:05,546
Let's not turn
on one another.

406
00:25:05,617 --> 00:25:08,450
At least not
without a good reason.

407
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,715
Mulder: We should all
get some sleep.

408
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:12,017
You kidding?

409
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,786
You think any ofus
could sleep right now?

410
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,623
Guys, let's face it--

411
00:25:16,728 --> 00:25:18,662
we got to check for spots.

412
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,791
Any person or persons
who has them should be confined.

413
00:25:22,901 --> 00:25:24,869
Are we agreed on that?

414
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,904
Areyou going to do the exams?

415
00:25:26,972 --> 00:25:28,564
No.

416
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,870
We do them in front
ofeach other.

417
00:25:30,943 --> 00:25:32,205
No secrets.

418
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:40,542
Before anyone passesjudgement,
may l remind you

419
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:42,712
we are in the arctic.

420
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,484
Sleep tight.

421
00:26:13,552 --> 00:26:15,315
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

422
00:26:15,387 --> 00:26:17,321
DaSilva: Yeah. Good night.

423
00:26:32,304 --> 00:26:33,828
Good night, Mulder.

424
00:26:34,907 --> 00:26:36,465
Good night, Scully.

425
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:39,032
At least everyone's okay.

426
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:41,045
Don't forget.

427
00:26:41,113 --> 00:26:43,946
The spots
on the dog went away.

428
00:27:37,602 --> 00:27:40,366
Ballon the three-yardline.

429
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:43,840
Fourthandgoal with only 15seconds
leftin thegame.

430
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:45,843
Hemoves overtheball.
Here's thesnap.

431
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:47,344
Hegoes over...

432
00:28:30,122 --> 00:28:32,090
(Gasps)

433
00:28:40,098 --> 00:28:41,861
(Door Closes)

434
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:43,356
(Barking)

435
00:30:00,445 --> 00:30:02,879
(Dripping)

436
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:28,703
Mulder, what areyou doing?

437
00:30:28,773 --> 00:30:31,401
Murphy's dead.

438
00:30:32,444 --> 00:30:34,378
You killed him.

439
00:30:34,446 --> 00:30:36,778
l found him like this.

440
00:30:36,848 --> 00:30:38,782
l heard one ofthe doors close.

441
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,977
l came out
to check it out.

442
00:30:41,052 --> 00:30:43,418
lt was one ofyou.

443
00:30:43,488 --> 00:30:45,422
You could have done it
and not known.

444
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,855
He said he didn't.

445
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:48,289
l have no symptoms.

446
00:30:48,393 --> 00:30:49,826
You checked him.

447
00:30:49,895 --> 00:30:51,123
Six hours ago.

448
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:52,423
lt was one ofyou.

449
00:30:52,531 --> 00:30:54,999
Stop it!
Shut up!

450
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:59,268
Put the gun down and let

451
00:30:59,337 --> 00:31:00,929
Hodge giveyou a blood test.

452
00:31:01,006 --> 00:31:02,598
He'll doctor the results.

453
00:31:02,674 --> 00:31:04,437
l won't let him
stick a needle in me.

454
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:05,771
He has to be confined now.

455
00:31:05,844 --> 00:31:08,938
Turn around and let us
take a look atyour neck.

456
00:31:09,014 --> 00:31:10,606
l'm not turning
my back on anyone.

457
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:13,242
As far as l'm concerned,
you're all infected!

458
00:31:13,318 --> 00:31:15,582
Hodge is right.
We ought to lock him up.

459
00:31:15,654 --> 00:31:16,848
Mulder...

460
00:31:16,922 --> 00:31:18,856
Scully, get that gun offme.

461
00:31:18,924 --> 00:31:20,448
You have to understand.

462
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,491
Put it down!

463
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,618
You first!

464
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:23,751
Scully!

465
00:31:25,497 --> 00:31:27,692
For God's sakes, it's me.

466
00:31:27,766 --> 00:31:32,465
Mulder, you may not be
whoyou are.

467
00:31:57,996 --> 00:32:00,191
ln here l'll be safer than you.

468
00:33:03,795 --> 00:33:05,353
(Gasping)

469
00:33:05,463 --> 00:33:07,397
What wereyou doing?

470
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:09,433
You know what l was doing.

471
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:11,435
l can't help thinking,
Agent Scully

472
00:33:11,503 --> 00:33:13,437
you're the only one with a gun.

473
00:33:13,505 --> 00:33:15,837
lfyou get infected,
we don't stand a chance, do we?

474
00:33:26,418 --> 00:33:27,851
Okay.

475
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,393
Was there something there?

476
00:33:40,465 --> 00:33:42,865
Hodge: You're okay, Nancy.

477
00:33:42,934 --> 00:33:44,458
We're all okay.

478
00:33:44,536 --> 00:33:46,470
Now is not the time
for the three ofus

479
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:48,472
to break down
and turn on each other.

480
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,303
There's four ofus.

481
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:51,865
Mulder isn't one ofus.

482
00:33:51,943 --> 00:33:55,037
lf Mulder is infected,
it's not his fault.

483
00:33:55,113 --> 00:33:57,138
We can't turn our backs
on him now.

484
00:33:57,215 --> 00:33:59,149
He needs us to help him.

485
00:33:59,217 --> 00:34:00,411
She's right.

486
00:34:00,485 --> 00:34:01,747
Who knows

487
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,754
what prolonged exposure
to the parasite could do?

488
00:34:03,822 --> 00:34:06,689
lt could damage him to the point
ofpermanent psychosis.

489
00:34:08,426 --> 00:34:11,156
lfhe is infected,
he doesn't go back.

490
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:13,196
l won't risk
the possibilities.

491
00:34:24,242 --> 00:34:27,905
This is A.l.C.P.
calling Doolittle Airfield.

492
00:34:27,979 --> 00:34:29,276
Please come in.

493
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:31,315
(Static)

494
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:35,780
This is
the Arctic lce Corps Project

495
00:34:35,854 --> 00:34:38,254
sending a general distress call.

496
00:34:38,323 --> 00:34:39,688
Please respond.

497
00:34:39,758 --> 00:34:41,726
(Static)

498
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:01,038
Nancy, put a drop
ofthe uninfected blood

499
00:35:01,112 --> 00:35:03,205
on the slide ofthe blood
drawn from the pilot.

500
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:05,374
Run that by me again.

501
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:09,887
Put the uninfected blood
on the infected blood.

502
00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:19,289
No! Damn it!

503
00:35:19,397 --> 00:35:21,262
What did l just tell you?

504
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:23,266
You infected
already infected blood.

505
00:35:23,334 --> 00:35:25,268
We have to start over again.

506
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:27,270
l made a mistake.
Don'tyell at me.

507
00:35:27,338 --> 00:35:28,771
Wasted hours ofwork.

508
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,741
Maybeyou should do it byyourself!.
Damn it!

509
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:34,074
l'm notyour assistant!

510
00:35:42,387 --> 00:35:44,651
Hodge.

511
00:35:44,722 --> 00:35:46,314
What?

512
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:48,621
Come take a look at this.

513
00:35:51,029 --> 00:35:53,998
The larvae from two different worms
killed each other.

514
00:36:13,284 --> 00:36:15,411
An individual worm will not tolerate

515
00:36:15,487 --> 00:36:18,581
another invading its host.

516
00:36:18,656 --> 00:36:21,591
lt does to the invader
what it did to humans.

517
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:23,251
lt makes them kill.

518
00:36:23,361 --> 00:36:27,229
Hodge: But the species needs
another to procreate.

519
00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:29,061
Worms are hermaphroditic.

520
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:31,067
lt can reproduce itself.

521
00:36:31,135 --> 00:36:34,400
Look at the evidence
in the microscope.

522
00:36:34,472 --> 00:36:36,736
This thing does not like company.

523
00:36:36,808 --> 00:36:38,742
What areyou saying?

524
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,437
The way to kill it

525
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:42,104
is to introduce anotherworm

526
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,444
into an already infected body?

527
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:25,989
(Whining)

528
00:37:58,823 --> 00:38:00,654
lt sounds okay.

529
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:15,034
lt passed the worms
in its stool.

530
00:38:15,106 --> 00:38:17,040
They're dead.

531
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:23,113
l want to talk to him first.

532
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:25,206
Try and make this voluntary.

533
00:38:25,283 --> 00:38:27,012
What?

534
00:38:27,085 --> 00:38:29,019
You can't go in alone.

535
00:38:29,087 --> 00:38:33,649
lfanything happens,
you come inside.

536
00:38:33,758 --> 00:38:36,454
l can't do this to him
until l'm sure.

537
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,760
(Door Opening)

538
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:43,300
lt'sjustyou?

539
00:38:43,401 --> 00:38:45,835
Yes.

540
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,275
lt's one ofthem.

541
00:38:54,412 --> 00:38:57,381
No one's been killed
sinceyou've been in here.

542
00:38:57,482 --> 00:38:59,950
So?

543
00:39:02,353 --> 00:39:04,287
We found a way to kill it.

544
00:39:06,824 --> 00:39:10,590
Two worms in one host
will kill each other.

545
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:18,499
You give me one worm,
you'll infect me.

546
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:20,503
lfthat's true

547
00:39:20,571 --> 00:39:23,563
then why didn'tyou
let us inspectyou?

548
00:39:23,641 --> 00:39:27,202
l would have,
butyou pulled a gun on me.

549
00:39:27,311 --> 00:39:30,712
Now l don't trust them.

550
00:39:30,782 --> 00:39:33,114
l want to trustyou.

551
00:39:36,621 --> 00:39:38,384
Okay.

552
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:43,417
But now they're not here.

553
00:40:31,342 --> 00:40:33,276
This is the last one.

554
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,714
She's not going to let us
give it to him.

555
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:41,149
Well, she'll have to
ifhe's infected.

556
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:43,153
He'll convince her somehow.

557
00:40:50,962 --> 00:40:52,896
l just examined him.

558
00:40:52,964 --> 00:40:54,898
He's uninfected.

559
00:40:56,968 --> 00:40:59,198
So is she.

560
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:01,795
Which means
that it must be one ofyou.

561
00:41:03,574 --> 00:41:04,700
All right.

562
00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:07,039
Let's go over
to the main building.

563
00:41:07,111 --> 00:41:09,341
l'd like to check him myself.

564
00:41:09,413 --> 00:41:12,746
Then he can examine both ofus.

565
00:41:12,817 --> 00:41:14,614
You want to lead the way?

566
00:41:22,426 --> 00:41:23,757
No!

567
00:41:45,716 --> 00:41:47,240
Get the worm.

568
00:41:57,094 --> 00:41:58,561
Don't!

569
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,089
Oh, my God.

570
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:05,032
(Screaming)

571
00:42:08,406 --> 00:42:10,033
lt's her!

572
00:42:10,141 --> 00:42:11,699
No!

573
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:13,367
No!

574
00:42:15,847 --> 00:42:17,781
Scully!

575
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:19,976
lt's DaSilva.

576
00:42:29,861 --> 00:42:32,591
(Screaming Hysterically)

577
00:42:38,002 --> 00:42:40,163
DaSilva: No!

578
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,207
Hodge! Now!

579
00:42:47,278 --> 00:42:49,143
Mulder.

580
00:42:49,213 --> 00:42:51,647
After this,
there won't be any left.

581
00:42:51,716 --> 00:42:53,308
They're all going to be dead!

582
00:42:53,384 --> 00:42:54,817
Do it!

583
00:42:54,886 --> 00:42:56,114
(DaSilva Screaming)

584
00:42:56,187 --> 00:42:58,451
No!

585
00:42:58,522 --> 00:43:00,217
Shh, shh.

586
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:01,690
No!

587
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,522
Shh, shh.

588
00:43:03,594 --> 00:43:05,528
Shh, shh.

589
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:07,530
(Moaning)

590
00:43:16,173 --> 00:43:18,107
lt's all right.

591
00:43:18,175 --> 00:43:20,769
lt's all over.

592
00:43:20,878 --> 00:43:22,971
lt all stops right here.

593
00:43:23,047 --> 00:43:25,481
Right now.

594
00:43:36,594 --> 00:43:38,528
Okay, lock her down.

595
00:43:41,966 --> 00:43:44,400
She's being put in quarantine
along with the dog.

596
00:43:44,468 --> 00:43:46,402
We'll keep her there
until we're sure

597
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:49,064
she won't infect
the rest ofthe population.

598
00:43:49,173 --> 00:43:53,701
Our tests came back normal,
so we've been released.

599
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:55,574
Plane ready.

600
00:43:55,646 --> 00:43:59,207
lt will takeyou as far
from the ice as you want to go.

601
00:43:59,283 --> 00:44:01,251
l'm going back to the site.

602
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:03,253
This time l'm going fully prepared

603
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:05,084
with proper equipment.

604
00:44:05,156 --> 00:44:07,784
There's a lot ofresearch to be done
on the genetic structure

605
00:44:07,858 --> 00:44:09,291
on its origins...

606
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,793
Mulder, don'tyou know?

607
00:44:10,861 --> 00:44:12,726
Know what?

608
00:44:12,797 --> 00:44:16,255
45 minutes after they evacuated us
they torched the place.

609
00:44:16,334 --> 00:44:18,097
There's nothing left.

610
00:44:18,169 --> 00:44:19,898
Who did that?

611
00:44:19,971 --> 00:44:21,563
The military...

612
00:44:21,672 --> 00:44:23,401
the Center for Disease Control...

613
00:44:23,507 --> 00:44:25,236
you ought to know.

614
00:44:25,343 --> 00:44:27,277
They'reyour people.

615
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:36,111
lt's still there, Scully.

616
00:44:36,187 --> 00:44:39,452
200,000 years down.

617
00:44:39,523 --> 00:44:41,923
ln the ice.

618
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,594
Leave it there.
