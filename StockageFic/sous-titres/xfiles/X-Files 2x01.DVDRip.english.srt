<i>We wanted to call out.</i>

00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,758
<i>On August 20 and September 51977...</i>

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,152
<i>... two spacecraft were launched from</i>
<i>the Kennedy Space Flight Center, Florida.</i>

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,879
<i>They were called Voyager.</i>

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,875
<i>Each one carries a message.</i>

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,509
<i>(man) I send greetings</i>
<i>on behalf of the people of our planet.</i>

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,359
<i>We step out of our solar system</i>
<i>into the universe, seeking only...</i>

<i>(Mulder) A record depicting images,</i>
<i>music and sounds of our planet...</i>

<i>... a technologically mature</i>
<i>extraterrestrial civilisation.</i>

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,236
<i>(boy) Hello from the children of planet Earth.</i>

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,757
<i>(Mulder) 13 years after its launch,</i>
<i>Voyager 1 passed the orbit of Neptune...</i>

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,434
<i>... and essentially left our solar system.</i>

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,919
<i>Within that time,</i>
<i>there were no further messages sent...</i>

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,389
<i>... nor are any planned.</i>

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,356
<i>We wanted to listen.</i>

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,673
<i>On October 121992, NASA initiated</i>
<i>the High Resolution Microwave Survey...</i>

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,514
<i>... a search by radio telescopes</i>
<i>scanning ten million frequencies...</i>

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,388
<i>... for any transmission</i>
<i>by extraterrestrial intelligence.</i>

21
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,638
<i>Less than a year later,</i>
<i>Senator Richard Bryan...</i>

22
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,271
<i>... successfully championed an amendment</i>
<i>which terminated the project.</i>

23
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,035
<i>I wanted to believe,</i>
<i>but the tools had been taken away.</i>

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,349
<i>The X-Files had been shut down.</i>

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,351
<i>They closed our eyes.</i>

26
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,829
<i>Our voices have been silenced.</i>

27
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,391
<i>Our ears now deaf to the realms</i>
<i>of extreme possibilities.</i>

28
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,232

33
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,798
<i>(man #1) Cecil and me,</i>
<i>we went to that strip joint.</i>

34
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,589
- <i>(man #2) You treat yourself?</i>
- <i>(man #1) Man, let me tell you!</i>

35
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,992
- <i>(man #1) You know that one Tuesday?</i>
- <i>Wait, wait. You went on Tuesday?</i>

36
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,829
- <i>No. That's the stripper's name: Tuesday.</i>
- <i>Oh, yeah. I know her.</i>

37
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,799
<i>She's on stage dancing to that</i>
<i>Offspring song, "Come Out and Play".</i>

38
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,189
- <i>Nice touch.</i>
- <i>Very hot.</i>

39
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,271
- <i>Keep going.</i>
- <i>I'm tipping her big.</i>

40
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,830
<i>No ones, five spots. I'm laying 'em</i>
<i>on the rail- boom, boom, boom.</i>

41
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,629
- <i>She didn't like it?</i>
- <i>By the end of the song, I had $40 laid out.</i>

42
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,271
<i>It's not a long song, is it?</i>

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,993
<i>(Scully)</i> It is advantageous to begin
an autopsy by removing the cranium.

44
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,234
The cranium is opened with a horizontal
division an inch above the eyebrow ridges.

45
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,911
Something wrong?

46
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,028
What this man imagined...

47
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,031
...his dreams...

48
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,793
...who he loved, saw, heard...

49
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,871
...remembered...

50
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,351
...what he feared...

51
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,755
...somehow it's...

52
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,877
...all locked in this small mass
of tissue and fluid.

53
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,199
Are you OK, Agent Scully?
You kind of sounded a little spooky.

54
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,270
Good afternoon, Agent Mulder.

55
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,831
<i>(door opens)</i>

56
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,313
$4 for the first hour of parking is criminal.

57
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,112
What you got better be worth
at least 45 minutes.

58
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,953
You know, Mulder, from...

59
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,918
...from back there you looked like him.
- Him?

60
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,953
- Deep Throat.
- He's dead, Scully.

61
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,398
I attended his funeral at Arlington through
binoculars from a thousand yards away.

62
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,190
Now the picture frame was turned down.
You wanted to talk. What have you found?

63
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,352
I wanted to talk,
but I haven't found anything.

64
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,719
It's dangerous for us just to have a little chat.
We must assume we're being watched.

65
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,076
- I haven't seen any indication...
- No, of course not.

66
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,676
- These people are the best.
- I've taken all of the necessary precautions.

67
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,959
I have doubled back to make sure I haven't
been followed. No one has ever followed me.

68
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,752
The X-Files have been terminated, Mulder.
We have been reassigned.

69
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,358
- What makes you think they care about us?
- So why have you come here covertly?

70
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,797
Because I realised that it was
the only way that you would see me.

71
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,873
- So what do you want?
- To know that you're all right.

72
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,870
Mulder, you passed me today
within a foot, but you were miles away.

73
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,589
I'm on electronic surveillance.

74
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,639
White-bread cases, bank fraud,
insurance fraud, healthcare swindles.

75
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,109
Mulder, I know that you feel...

76
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,433
...frustrated, that without
the Bureau's resources you can't continue...

77
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,511
- No. It...
- Well, what then?

78
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,430
When we were shut down, you said you'd
go on for as long as the truth was out there.

79
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,155
But I no longer feel that from you.

80
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,431
Have you ever been to San Diego?

81
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,191
Yeah.

82
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,951
Did you check out the Palomar Observatory?

83
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,393
No.

84
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,268
From 1948 until recently,
it was the largest telescope in the world.

85
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,309
The idea came from a brilliant and wealthy
astronomer named George Ellery Hale.

86
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,949
The idea was presented to Hale
while he was playing billiards.

87
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,956
An elf climbed in his window and said to get
the money from the Rockefeller Foundation.

88
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,679
And you're worried that all your life
you've been seeing elves?

89
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,275
In my case...

90
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,998
...little green men.

91
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,635
But, Mulder, during your time
with the X-Files you've seen so much.

92
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,598
That's just the point. <i>Seeing</i> is not enough.

93
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,673
I should have something to hold on to.
Some solid evidence.

94
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,389
I learned that from you.

95
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,237
Your sister's abduction -
you've held on to that.

96
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,669
I'm beginning to wonder if...

97
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,951
...if that ever even happened.

98
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,912
Mulder...

99
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,915
...even if George Hale only saw elves
in his mind, the telescope still got built.

100
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,511
Don't give up.

101
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,511
And next time...

102
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,391
...we meet out in the open.

103
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,311
<i>(sighs)</i>

104
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,077
<i>(man) She had erased a conversation</i>
<i>between President Nixon and HR Haldeman...</i>

105
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,071
<i>... while transcribing the tape.</i>

106
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,679
<i>Woods testified that</i>
<i>she erased only about five minutes...</i>

107
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,753
<i>... but the tape contained an 18-minute gap.</i>
<i>Under investigation...</i>

108
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,114

109
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,318
<i>... HR Haldeman reiterated</i>
<i>the White House explanation that Woods...</i>

110
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,916
- Do we have to watch this, Fox?
- Leave it. I'm watching <i>The Magician</i> at nine.

111
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,037
Mom and Dad said
I could watch the movie, buttmunch.

112
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,079
They're next door at the Galbrands',
and they said <i>I'm</i> in charge.

113
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,713
Hey, get out of my life!

114
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,791
Agh!

115
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,276
I'm watching <i>The Magician.</i>

116
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,391
Now look! The fuse has blown.

117
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,711

118
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,871

00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,436

<i>(door opens)</i>

124
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,470
We're going to the Hill.

125
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,592
<i>(§ Bach's "Brandenburg Concerto No.2")</i>

126
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,311

00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,191
<i>(music continues)</i>

128
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,990
- Do you know this, Fox?
- It's Bach.

129
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,679
<i>Brandenburg Concerto No.3.</i>

130
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,513
Two.

131
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,637
Good thing it wasn't
a <i>Double Jeopardy</i> question.

132
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,873
Do you know the significance of this piece?

133
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,753
Well, recalling music appreciation
with Professor Ganz...

134
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,956
...Bach had a genius for polyphonic...

135
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,079
This is the first selection of music
on the <i>Voyager</i> spacecraft.

136
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,154
The first.

137
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,357
Four and a half billion years from now...

138
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,638
...when the sun exhausts its fuel
and swells to engulf the Earth...

139
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,912
...this expression will still be out there...

140
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,991
...travelling four and a half billion years.

141
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,750
That is, if it's not intercepted first.

142
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,149
Imagine, Fox...

143
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,676
...if another civilisation out there
were to hear this.

144
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,355
They would think
what a wonderful place the Earth must be.

145
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,513
I would want this to be the...
first contact with another life form.

146
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,075
I know I've let you down.

147
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,112
You've supported me
at great risk to your reputation.

148
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,875
I realise that when they shut us down,
there was nothing you could do.

149
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,315
All I can say is, I think we were close.

150
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,829
To what, I don't know.

151
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,791
What?

152
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,720
Do you like Bach, Mulder?

153
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,312
- I live for Bach.
- Then let's hear it again.

154
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,791
I take it you are familiar with the
High Resolution Microwave Survey?

155
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,078
The search for extraterrestrial radio signals.
They shut it down.

156
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,870
You have to get to the radio telescope
at Arecibo, Puerto Rico.

157
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:36,592
I'll try to delay them as long as I can, but
my guess is you'll have at least 24 hours.

158
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,992
After that, I can no longer hold off
the Blue Beret UFO Retrieval Team.

159
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,796
And they have been authorised
to display terminal force.

160
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,871
What am I looking for?

161
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,791
Contact.

162
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,031
- <i>(man) When did you last see Agent Mulder?</i>
- <i>(Scully) Yesterday.</i>

163
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,315
- <i>Where?</i>
- <i>In the bull pen hallway.</i>

164
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,390
<i>Did you speak with him?</i>

165
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,789
<i>No. Is he in some kind of trouble?</i>

166
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,954
<i>He failed to appear at his assignment</i>
<i>this morning. His whereabouts are unknown.</i>

167
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,155
- <i>I'll volunteer to assist in any search.</i>
- <i>No, Agent Scully...</i>

168
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,675
- She doesn't know where he is.
- How can you be so sure?

169
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,355
Because if she knew,
she wouldn't be so worried about him.

170
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,920
I don't smoke.

171
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,193
She'll find him.

172
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,151
<i>Gracias.</i>

173
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,553
No trace evidence apparent
around the exterior of the control room...

174
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,200
...which is locked with chains.

175
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,480
The power has been turned off.

176
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,437
Although the control
panel lights are still on.

177
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,109
The room's about 30 by 15.

178
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,754
I see no signs of any recent occupation.

179
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,158
There's quite an odour of mildew
in the air. The air is stale.

180
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,028
If anyone's been here recently,
I see no indications.

181
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,631
<i>(whirring)</i>

182
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,311
<i>(tape rewinds)</i>

183
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,872
<i>(woman) Mulder! You hounded me to have</i>
<i>lunch today, and then you don't show.</i>

184
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,518
<i>You're a pig.</i>

185
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,591

186
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,070

<i>(footsteps)</i>

188
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,912
- What are you doing here, Agent Scully?
- Are you following me?

189
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,350
Agent Mulder's residence is under
surveillance. Explain why you're here.

190
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,909
I was told by the assistant director
that Mulder was gone.

191
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,754
- So?
- So whenever he's away, I feed his fish.

192
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,269
What the hell is this?

193
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,431
Looks like a self-test the computer does.

194
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,510
- Damn.
- Just dump it in the tank.

195
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,633
That would be bad for the fish.

196
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,156
<i>(screams)</i>

197
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,798
<i>¡No me lastime, no me lastime!</i>

198
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,919
- Who are you? What are you doing here?
- <i>Por favor... Tengo mucho miedo.</i>

199
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,878
- <i>(cries)</i>
- That's all right. Settle down.

200
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,400
- Settle down.
- <i>Tenemos que irnos de aquí.</i>

202
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,312

203
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,391
<i>¿Nombre? ¿Nombre?</i>

204
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,672
Jorge.

205
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,194
<i>Me llamo Jorge Concepción.</i>

206
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,951
Jorge, why are you so afraid?

207
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,515
What have you seen?

208
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,351
<i>Luces...</i>

209
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,432
<i>... en el cielo... rojo...</i>

210
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,671
<i>... azul... anaranjado.</i>

211
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,196
<i>Pensé que una avioneta</i>
<i>se había estrellado...</i>

212
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,429
<i>Pero cuando llegué...</i>

213
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,636
<i>... vi hombres...</i>

214
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,870
<i>... como animales...</i>

215
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,076
<i>... pero no hombres.</i>

216
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,469
<i>Me agarraron y me pusieron aquí...</i>

217
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,993
- <i>¡Todavía están en el bosque!</i>
- <i>Jorge, no comprendo.</i>

218
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,638
Did you say men? <i>¿Hombres?</i>

219
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,871
It looks like the "Wow!" signal.

220
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,708
- The "Wow!" signal?
- Ohio State has a radio telescope...

221
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,509
...that conducts searches
for extraterrestrial intelligence.

222
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,351
In August 1977, my buddy Jerry Ehman...

223
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,716
...found a transmission
on a printout like this.

224
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,519
He was so excited,
he wrote "Wow!" in the margins.

225
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,397
What was there?

226
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,359
A signal - 30 times stronger
than galactic background noise.

227
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,079
It was on the 21cm frequency, which no
satellite transmitters are allowed to use.

228
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,596
The signal was intermittent,
like Morse code.

229
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,154
And more importantly, the signal seemed to
turn itself on while in the telescope's beam.

230
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,473
The "Wow!" signal is the best evidence
of extraterrestrial intelligence. But this...

231
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,111
This is better.

232
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,350
Where did you get this?

233
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,194
Maybe you can tell me.
Is that from Ohio State?

234
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,672
Can't tell.

235
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,275
There are a few nickel-and-dime
SETI projects around.

236
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,111
UC Berkeley has one. The Planetary Society
has one at Harvard and in Argentina.

237
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,035
NASA was working out of Goldstone
in California and Arecibo in Puerto Rico.

238
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,877
Mulder.

239
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,595
This signal from 06.30 Tuesday: The narrow
band and matching of the antenna pattern...

240
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,593
...indicates that it originated
from beyond lunar distance.

241
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,989
- The same message is...
- <i>(beeping)</i>

242
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,551
No! Jorge, don't touch that red button.
<i>Noho</i> on the <i>rojo.</i>

243
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,871
Thanks.

244
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,071
The same message is transmitted
four hours later on a wide band...

245
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:13,509
...which puts its point of origin very close,
just miles away from...

246
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,635
<i>(tape plays)</i>

247
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,635

<i>the people of our planet. We step out of our...</i>

248
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,349

- It's just a tape machine, Jorge.

249
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,908
<i>¡Vámonos inmediatamente, por favor!</i>

250
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,594
Where are we gonna go?
There's a storm outside.

251
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,671
<i>(high-pitched tone)</i>

252
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,909
You can't be afraid, Jorge.

00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,799
<i>(tone stops)</i>

254
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,075
Don't be afraid.

00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,351
You can't be afraid.

256
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,271

257
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,271

274
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,558
Relax. We know where she's going:
St Croix, Caribbean Air, flight 519.

275
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,918
Takes off at five after seven.
The gate's in the other terminal.

276
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,878
I'd like a ticket on the 6.30 flight to San Juan.

277
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,231
The day is...

278
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,071
The time is 10.30.

279
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,550
Although not a pathologist,
I will record my observations of the body...

280
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,839
...in case at some future time decomposition
should obscure forensic evidence.

281
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,870
The subject, perhaps victim,
is Hispanic male...

282
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,711
...undetermined age.

283
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,792
There are no overt
external injuries apparent.

284
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,637
There are no indications
of any lightning strikes.

285
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,358
No singeing of the hair
or burns of any kind.

286
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,598
There are no...

287
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,275
There are no puncture wounds
due to needles or probes...

288
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,796
...commonly associated
with cases of alien abduction.

289
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,038
The subject was discovered
in a sitting position...

290
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,750
...rigor mortis having set in - although
less than half an hour had elapsed.

291
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,032
The skin is strikingly affected
by goose flesh.

292
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,237
The body shows signs
of intense cadaveric spasm.

293
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,150
The expression reflects...

294
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,869
My God, Scully,
it's as if he's been frightened to death.

295
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,509
Again, Scully, nothing but evidence.

296
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,195
And again, no evidence at all.

297
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,711
The printouts of received transmission
indicate contact with another life form...

298
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,870
...and yet I cannot see them.

299
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,874
And even if I could see them,
would they really be there?

300
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,239
This could be a classified military satellite -
these transmissions are from the <i>Voyager.</i>

301
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,915
Could extraterrestrials
really have intercepted them?

302
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,111
Or is this just some elaborate joke
played on those who want to believe?

303
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,673
I was sent here by one of those people.

304
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,830
Deep Throat said "Trust no one."

305
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,149
That's hard, Scully.

306
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,629
Suspecting everyone, everything.

307
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,871
It wears you down. You even begin
to doubt what you know is the truth.

308
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,951
Before...

309
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,429
...I could only trust myself.

310
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,750
Now, I can only trust you.

311
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,510
And they've taken you away from me.

312
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,119
My life up to this point
has been about the need to see her again.

313
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,991
To see them.

314
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,914
But what would I do if they really came?

315
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,151

Mulder...

325
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,913
I was sure you were dead.

326
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,673
Mulder... it's Scully.

327
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,069
Dana Scully. Do you know where you are?

328
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,951
They came, Scully.

329
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,029
The ones that took her, they were here.

330
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,475
Here? Or here?

331
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,393
On the tapes. The tape.

332
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,471
Evidence. Proof.

333
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,910
- The transmissions. It's all here.
- Proof of what?

334
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,275
Contact.

335
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,749
These printouts. It's here.

336
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,791
And the man.

337
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,950
We'll have to examine the body.
There'll be more proof.

338
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,031
<i>(rattling)</i>

339
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,509
- Is that them?
- No, this isn't it.

340
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,429
It's the Blue Beret Crash Retrieval Team.
They'll kill us. The body!

341
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,272
- We don't have time.
- Help me!

342
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,989
We're never gonna be able
to get the body out of the country!

343
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,909
Mulder, we <i>have</i> to go.

344
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,989
Evidence is worthless if you're dead.

345
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,753
Let's go!

346
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,912
Hold your fire! Get this truck
to the bottom of the hill!

347
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,592
Move! Come on, move!

348
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,392
Mulder!

349
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,237
Dammit.

350
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,079
You left your off-site setup.
Another brick agent had to cover you.

351
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,598
The entire surveillance, all the months of
work on this case, gone. Just like you, gone.

352
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,914
This has fourbagger all over it, Mulder.

353
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,678
Censure, transfer, suspension, probation.

354
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,750
Leaving my assignment
warrants disciplinary action.

355
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,116
- And I'm willing to accept those measures.
- But?

356
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,830
But I had enough to arrest
those suspects after three days.

357
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,276
I could've nailed them on 40 counts
of bank fraud. But you left me there.

358
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,954
I'm surprised you even noticed I was gone.

359
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,397
Let alone wiretap my phone,
an illegal procedure without a court order!

360
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,431
Your time is over...

361
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,511
...and you leave with nothing.

362
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,999
Get out.

363
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,950
I said, get the hell out.

364
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,114
Report back to your assignment.

365
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,508
A minute ago I was a fourbagger.

366
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,351
Do you want me to make the arrests?

367
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,868
I think we need more to go on.

368
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,478
Continue the surveillance.

369
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,591
<i>(tape hisses)</i>

370
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,348
It should be right here.

371
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,440
The entire tape is blank.

372
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,552
An electrical surge during the storm
may have degaussed everything...

373
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,359
...erasing the entire tape.

374
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,188
You still have nothing.

375
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,109
I may not have the X-Files, Scully,
but I still have my work.

376
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,199
And I still have you.

377
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,788
And I still have myself.

378
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,593
<i>(man #1) What's the difference</i>
<i>between a lap dance and a table dance?</i>

379
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,353
<i>(man #2) A lap dance, they're all over you.</i>

380
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,476
<i>(man #1) A lap dance costs what?</i>

381
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,996
<i>(man #1) All right, all right.</i>
<i>Tell me the best spot. Where?</i>

382
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,311
- <i>Paramount. But you gotta spend money.</i>
- <i>I'm there.</i>

383
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,794
<i>(man #1) Wednesday, it's your dancer?</i>

384
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,397
<i>No, don't go Wednesday.</i>
<i>That's amateur night.</i>

385
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,710
<i>(man #1) Amateurs, huh? Nice touch!</i>

386
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,679
- <i>(man #2) They're not really amateurs.</i>
- <i>Yeah, sure, sure.</i>

387
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,999
<i>If you don't mind spending the money,</i>
<i>the girls are all over you.</i>

388
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,674
<i>And they're good-looking too...</i>

389
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,711

00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,478

391
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,308
