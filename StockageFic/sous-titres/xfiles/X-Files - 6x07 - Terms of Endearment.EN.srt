How many?

475
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:04,345
Four total. All here
for some time.

476
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:09,944
Maybe years. All normal, though, Mulder.
No osteological deformities.

477
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:16,050
And Betsy's baby isn't here.
There are no fresh graves.

478
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,426
- I know.
- What do you think he did with it?

479
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:24,263
- I don't think he did anything with it.
- But she was recently pregnant.

I mean, I saw her records,
her sonograms, in the house.

481
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:31,505
Showing the same defects.
These weren't Wayne's babies, Scully.

482
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:36,342
- Well, whose babies were they?
- I think Wayne realized something
last night.

483
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:41,646
That's why he was out here digging.
He realized he'd met someone
more evil than he was...

484
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:46,053
who had sacrificed what he desperately
wanted for himself.

- Betsy?
- It was no coincidence that
she ran into us last night.

486
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:53,956
We were taken in by her
just like Wayne was, by a woman
who would say anything...

487

<i>or do anything to get what she wanted,</i>
<i>who was even more driven than he was.</i>

488

-Driven to what?
-To have what only Wayne could give her.
