1
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:13,735
I came in search
of something I did not believe existed.

2
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,519
I've stayed on now
in spite of myself,

3
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:24,489
in spite of everything
I've ever held to be true.

4
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,595
I will continue here
as long as I can...

5
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:34,189
as long as you are beset
by the haunting illness...

6
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,896
which I saw consume
your beautiful mind.

7
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,804
What is this discovery
I've made?

8
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,809
How can I reconcile what I see
with what I know?

9
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:47,469
I feel this was meant
not for me to find,

10
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,072
but for you
to make sense of...

11
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,914
make the connections
which can't be ignored.

12
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:58,954
Connections which, for me,
deny all logic and reason.

13
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,462
What is this source of power
I hold in my hand... this rubbing?

14
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:12,437
This simple impression taken
from the surface of the craft?

15
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:16,737
I watched this rubbing take
its undeniable hold on you...

16
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,971
saw you succumb to
its spiraling effect.

17
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:21,639
Now, I must work to uncover...

18
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:24,581
what your illness
prevents you from finding.

19
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:28,087
In the source of every illness
lies its cure.

20
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:46,267
Who's there?

21
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,273
Who's there?

22
00:03:44,922 --> 00:03:48,756
He's been quiet
for the last 36 hours.

23
00:03:48,826 --> 00:03:50,760
But he doesn't sleep.

24
00:03:50,828 --> 00:03:52,762
There's activity in
the temporal lobe...

25
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,321
we've just never seen.

26
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:59,927
It won't allow his brain
to rest or shut down,

27
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:02,598
manifesting in episodes
of aggression.

28
00:04:02,673 --> 00:04:04,834
Sometimes against himself.

29
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:08,242
- You can't sedate him?
- Yes.

30
00:04:08,312 --> 00:04:12,248
We slow him down for short periods
and put him in the neuro ward.

31
00:04:12,316 --> 00:04:15,251
It's the only way
we're able to run tests.

32
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,253
But over time,

33
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,255
his brain is going
to just die.

34
00:04:32,837 --> 00:04:34,771
Agent Mulder?

35
00:04:46,817 --> 00:04:49,217
Agent Mulder,
can you hear me?

36
00:04:53,924 --> 00:04:55,858
Do you know who I am?

37
00:04:57,895 --> 00:05:00,125
It's Skinner.
Walter Skinner.

38
00:05:06,237 --> 00:05:08,262
Can we get him out of here?
Get him some fresh air, at least?

39
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,367
Let him go!
He can't breathe!

40
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:27,991
-  Where?
- Let go, Mulder.
I don't want to hurt you.

41
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,994
Come on.
Let him go.

42
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:37,595
- Stay there, Mr. Skinner.

43
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:39,727
No, it's all right.
Just let me get up.

44
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:54,041
- Five milligrams of haloperidol, I.M.

45
00:05:54,118 --> 00:05:56,746
- I want him in five-point restraints.

46
00:05:56,821 --> 00:05:58,755
Yes, sir.

47
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:18,801
My God.

48
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:20,928
What happened here?

49
00:07:23,741 --> 00:07:26,141
They said you speak English.

50
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,805
- What do you want?
-  I'm sorry.

51
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,316
You must wonder who I am.
I'm Amina Ngebe.

52
00:07:33,384 --> 00:07:35,716
I have come to see
your discovery.

53
00:07:35,786 --> 00:07:40,314
I asked that no one be told about it,
nor that I'm here.

54
00:07:40,391 --> 00:07:43,155
Yes, well,
it is still a secret,

55
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:45,320
but a well-known one,
I'm afraid.

56
00:07:45,396 --> 00:07:50,800
Dr. Merkmallen called it
the 'African internet. "God rest him.

57
00:07:52,303 --> 00:07:54,771
You knew
Dr. Merkmallen?

58
00:07:54,838 --> 00:07:58,171
I, too, am a professor
of biology at the university.

59
00:07:58,242 --> 00:08:02,804
But, uh, hardly one qualified
to say what must have gone on here.

60
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:08,650
Well, I was working late
last night by lamplight,

61
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:12,815
and, uh, I saw a man
who vanished.

62
00:08:14,358 --> 00:08:17,020
And then
they just swarmed.

63
00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:21,822
You must not let
the men know...

64
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:24,231
what happened to you
last night.

65
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:26,565
The vanishing man,
none of it.

66
00:08:26,637 --> 00:08:28,229
Why?

67
00:08:28,305 --> 00:08:30,500
They are animists,

68
00:08:30,574 --> 00:08:32,633
believing
nature is vengeful.

69
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,440
They'll take this as a sign
to leave what you have found alone.

70
00:08:35,512 --> 00:08:38,538
- A bad omen.
- Caused by the ship out there?

71
00:08:38,615 --> 00:08:41,243
Mmm.
Caused by God,

72
00:08:41,318 --> 00:08:43,582
who will be much less helpful
than those men...

73
00:08:43,654 --> 00:08:46,248
if we are to continue
this work.

74
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:21,347
Quick! He's gotta get
to a hospital!

75
00:09:21,423 --> 00:09:23,357
- Hospital!

76
00:09:23,425 --> 00:09:25,359
Okay!

77
00:09:30,232 --> 00:09:32,462
You see?
Another warning.

78
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:32,793
Agent Mulder?

79
00:10:36,665 --> 00:10:38,690
I want to help you.

80
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:46,472
I don't know what to do.
I don't have much time.

81
00:10:54,683 --> 00:10:57,277
Can you write?

82
00:11:17,806 --> 00:11:21,902
I feel you slipping away from me
with every minute I fail here.

83
00:11:24,913 --> 00:11:27,814
What are the elusive meanings
I cannot see...

84
00:11:27,883 --> 00:11:29,817
that are hidden here?

85
00:11:33,722 --> 00:11:38,022
If I could understand it,
know how it affected you,

86
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:40,891
learn how to use its power
to save you...

87
00:12:22,838 --> 00:12:24,772
What is it?

88
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,777
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't speak your language.

89
00:12:46,862 --> 00:12:48,796
Perhaps you need
an interpreter?

90
00:12:48,864 --> 00:12:50,889
Stay away from me!

91
00:12:50,966 --> 00:12:53,958
Are you gonna hack me up
in front of my driver?

92
00:12:54,036 --> 00:12:57,130
- Word is you're under
suspicion already.
- You're the murderer here!

93
00:12:57,205 --> 00:12:58,900
Murderer of who?

94
00:12:58,974 --> 00:13:01,272
Dr. Merkmallen.

95
00:13:01,343 --> 00:13:04,312
I murdered no one.
But I won't be sent away from here.

96
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:06,347
I know what we've got.

97
00:13:06,415 --> 00:13:10,613
This craft that's come ashore,
its extraterrestrial origins.

98
00:13:10,685 --> 00:13:12,846
You don't even believe
in that.

99
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:15,583
Nor do you,
but here we are.

100
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:25,132
I'm here only to help
my partner.

101
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:28,361
Then let me help you...

102
00:13:28,437 --> 00:13:30,371
to read it.

103
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:34,102
I've spent my life looking
for what's out there.

104
00:13:34,176 --> 00:13:37,339
The answer to what theologians
have pondered for millennia.

105
00:13:39,147 --> 00:13:42,310
The key to everything...
to life itself.

106
00:13:42,384 --> 00:13:44,818
I've already
been threatened...

107
00:13:44,886 --> 00:13:47,980
by men in Washington
about what I know.

108
00:13:48,056 --> 00:13:50,650
How long would your secret keep
if you were to send me away?

109
00:14:04,473 --> 00:14:06,407
What is it?

110
00:14:10,378 --> 00:14:12,073
It is a sea of blood.

111
00:14:59,393 --> 00:15:01,327
Yeah.

112
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:06,426
- Michael Kritschgau?
- It's 6:00 in the morning.

113
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,264
I don't know if you remember me.
My name's Skinner.

114
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:12,828
- I'm here to talk to you
about Fox Mulder.
- Yeah, I'm listening.

115
00:15:12,906 --> 00:15:16,137
He's in a serious condition,
Mr. Kritschgau. He asked to talk to you.

116
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,235
I got nothin'
to say to the man.

117
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:22,945
You know,
I had a job...

118
00:15:23,016 --> 00:15:25,746
with a government
pension coming.

119
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:29,653
And two years ago,
Fox Mulder asked me to do him a favor.

120
00:15:29,723 --> 00:15:32,817
Blow the whistle on Uncle Sam's
U.F.O. propaganda mill.

121
00:15:32,893 --> 00:15:37,626
And all it got me
was this swanky address.

122
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:40,496
Look, he doesn't have
much time.

123
00:15:42,803 --> 00:15:46,603
Hey, I'm not a doctor.
What is it you think I can do for him?

124
00:15:46,673 --> 00:15:49,369
All I know is that
he asked for you.

125
00:15:54,781 --> 00:15:57,511
Can he even recognize me?

126
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:01,720
To be honest,
I don't know.

127
00:16:10,097 --> 00:16:12,463
- Agent Mulder?

128
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:15,057
His brain
is on constant redline.

129
00:16:15,135 --> 00:16:17,626
They've got him on haloperidol
just to keep him on the monitors.

130
00:16:17,704 --> 00:16:21,071
- Haloperidol?
- He becomes violently agitated.

131
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:23,803
He just won't speak or sleep,
even when he's medicated.

132
00:16:23,877 --> 00:16:26,505
There's activity in part of his brain
they've never seen before.

133
00:16:28,115 --> 00:16:30,515
- Was his...

134
00:16:32,052 --> 00:16:35,351
Was his what?

135
00:16:35,422 --> 00:16:37,822
I started to ask you a question
about his prior mental state,

136
00:16:37,891 --> 00:16:40,155
but he anticipated it.

137
00:16:40,227 --> 00:16:42,821
Second time.

138
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:48,359
- Agent Mulder?

139
00:16:53,573 --> 00:16:56,064
He claimed to be
hearing voices.

140
00:17:01,148 --> 00:17:03,412
I might know why
Agent Mulder asked for me.

141
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:08,250
- Doesn't mean I can do
anything for him.
- What just happened?

142
00:17:10,057 --> 00:17:13,458
I think he responded
to a question that... I didn't ask.

143
00:17:37,351 --> 00:17:40,582
I don't know how long we can
keep him out of that unit.
We could be held responsible.

144
00:17:40,654 --> 00:17:43,282
You asked me
to come down here.

145
00:17:43,357 --> 00:17:46,588
You better be prepared to accept
the responsibility, Mr. Skinner.

146
00:17:51,732 --> 00:17:55,998
- You're going to inject him?
- No. You are.

147
00:17:58,005 --> 00:18:00,803
With a thousand milligrams
of phenytoin.

148
00:18:00,874 --> 00:18:04,332
I'm not injecting him with anything...
not now and not till after
I've talked to his doctor.

149
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:06,641
He's being given
the wrong treatment.

150
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:09,477
- You're not a doctor.
- No, but I've seen his condition.

151
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:14,086
Who do you want
to trust?

152
00:18:15,822 --> 00:18:18,655
Seen it where?

153
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:21,489
In a study.

154
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:25,725
There's something like E.S.P.
called "remote viewing."

155
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:29,428
- Whose study?
- The company's.
The C.I.A., Mr. Skinner.

156
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,267
Extreme subjects would
go into arrest,

157
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:34,773
their minds working harder
than their bodies could sustain.

158
00:18:34,841 --> 00:18:37,332
They became, in effect,
all brain.

159
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:40,778
Phenytoin was the only thing
that could slow the electrical
impulses to a normal rate.

160
00:18:44,951 --> 00:18:47,317
Agent Mulder knew about this.

161
00:18:48,855 --> 00:18:52,484
That's why he asked for you.

162
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,667
They're coming.

163
00:19:36,736 --> 00:19:39,068
- Who last saw him?
- I'm looking here.

164
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:41,369
I come here and find a patient missing,
and nobody knew?

165
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:43,875
Well, I just came on.
Sorry. Uh, Fox Mulder, right?

166
00:19:43,944 --> 00:19:46,037
He's restrained, it says.
And he's not in his bed?

167
00:19:46,113 --> 00:19:49,446
No. How many times
can I say it?

168
00:19:55,455 --> 00:19:57,423
He's right here.

169
00:19:57,491 --> 00:19:59,425
He wasn't here
when I came in.

170
00:19:59,493 --> 00:20:02,155
No, we just found him
down the hall.

171
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:04,390
- I just got him back into bed.
- Who are you?

172
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:07,024
- I'm his boss, and hers.
- Well, I don't know...

173
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,898
how he could've gotten up by himself
or pulled all this stuff out.

174
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:10,604
Well, I hope someone's calling a doctor
and making a report on this.

175
00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:13,402
Well, I hope someone's calling a doctor
and making a report on this.

176
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:15,407
He has got to remain
in this bed.

177
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:17,807
I'll stay with him.

178
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:23,215
Agent Fowley, why don't you see
if you can help her.

179
00:20:24,382 --> 00:20:26,316
That's an order,
Agent Fowley.

180
00:20:38,997 --> 00:20:40,931
She knows.

181
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:43,627
- You can read her mind?
- Yeah.

182
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:47,069
- We gotta act fast.
- The doctor's on his way.

183
00:20:47,138 --> 00:20:50,301
- No doctors. Get me Scully.
- I don't know where she is.

184
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:54,277
Look, I know
you've been compromised.

185
00:20:54,346 --> 00:20:56,439
I know Krycek
is threatening your life,

186
00:20:56,514 --> 00:20:59,005
blackmailing you.

187
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:01,018
You don't think
I can trust you.

188
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:03,486
But it's not you
that I need.

189
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:06,115
- Then who?
- Him.

190
00:21:08,326 --> 00:21:10,260
Kritschgau.

191
00:21:10,328 --> 00:21:13,024
- Ask him to prove it.
- Prove what?

192
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:15,760
What's causing this.

193
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:19,600
It's a brain abnormality.
It's how you're able to read minds.

194
00:21:19,671 --> 00:21:23,869
What's causing this is alien.
It's why my doctors can't help me.

195
00:21:23,942 --> 00:21:26,308
I don't believe in aliens, Agent Mulder.
I think you know that.

196
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:30,542
I do.
That's why I need you.

197
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,851
The work here is painstaking.

198
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:41,619
A slow and tedious
piecing together.

199
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:43,718
It appears to be a craft...

200
00:21:43,795 --> 00:21:47,561
its skin covered in the intricate
symbols you and I both saw,

201
00:21:47,632 --> 00:21:51,830
but which I now understand
are part of a complex communication.

202
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:59,607
Dr. Barnes has broken some
of the symbols into letters,

203
00:21:59,678 --> 00:22:02,203
using an ancient
Navaho alphabet.

204
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,374
And though it has helped
to uncover some of what's here,

205
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,886
it has also made
for greater confusion.

206
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:19,252
On the top surface of the craft,
I'm finding words...

207
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:21,595
describing human genetics.

208
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:31,202
Efforts to read the bottom
of the craft have been harder.

209
00:22:31,276 --> 00:22:34,939
Our workers were scared away
by a phenomena I admit I can't explain.

210
00:22:36,681 --> 00:22:39,445
A sea of blood,
a swarm of insects.

211
00:22:41,052 --> 00:22:43,953
But what little we've found
has been staggering.

212
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:47,082
Passages from
the Christian Bible,

213
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:50,650
from Pagan religions,
from ancient Sumaria.

214
00:22:50,729 --> 00:22:53,789
Science and mysticism
conjoined.

215
00:22:53,865 --> 00:22:58,393
But more than words,
they are somehow imbued with power.

216
00:22:59,537 --> 00:23:02,597
I've ignored warnings
to quit this work,

217
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:05,871
remaining committed
to finding answers,

218
00:23:05,944 --> 00:23:08,708
afraid only that
our secret here won't last...

219
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,078
and that I
might be too late.

220
00:23:16,721 --> 00:23:18,655
I have something
to show you.

221
00:23:18,723 --> 00:23:20,657
More pieces of the puzzle.

222
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:26,823
I couldn't believe it.

223
00:23:26,898 --> 00:23:29,833
I thought I was
making it up in my head,

224
00:23:29,901 --> 00:23:32,768
- That it could not be true.
- What?

225
00:23:32,837 --> 00:23:35,965
What this is.

226
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,669
What the symbols spell out
is a passage from the Koran.

227
00:23:41,112 --> 00:23:45,173
Quyama...
the day of final judgement.

228
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:49,012
On a spacecraft,

229
00:23:49,087 --> 00:23:51,487
teachings of
the ancient prophet Mohammed?

230
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,093
I found more too.

231
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:03,193
Twenty-four panels.

232
00:24:03,268 --> 00:24:05,634
One for each
human chromosome.

233
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:10,841
A map of their makeup.
Maybe a map...

234
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:13,400
of our entire
genetic makeup.

235
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:17,043
A complete human genome.

236
00:24:19,951 --> 00:24:22,044
I mean, it's like...

237
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,113
it's the most beautiful,
intricate work of art.

238
00:24:27,692 --> 00:24:29,626
It is the word of God.

239
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:33,520
You're wrong.

240
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,934
There is no God.

241
00:24:39,537 --> 00:24:41,664
What's out there
in the water...

242
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:44,173
is only what we call "God"...

243
00:24:44,242 --> 00:24:46,369
what we call "creation."

244
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,742
The spark that ignited
the fire that cooked...

245
00:24:48,813 --> 00:24:50,804
the old primordial soup.

246
00:24:50,882 --> 00:24:53,749
Made animate from inanimate.
Made us.

247
00:24:53,818 --> 00:24:56,378
I believe he is mad
from the sun.

248
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:59,423
Mad?
I'm perfectly sane.

249
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:03,419
Because today,
I understand everything.

250
00:25:03,495 --> 00:25:07,488
Beginning and end, alpha and omega,
everything in between.

251
00:25:07,565 --> 00:25:11,558
It's all been written,
but the word is extraterrestrial.

252
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:14,537
You're sick, Dr. Barnes.

253
00:25:14,606 --> 00:25:16,540
You need to get
off your feet.

254
00:25:16,608 --> 00:25:19,236
Lie down.

255
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,677
You think you're going
to take the credit?

256
00:25:22,747 --> 00:25:24,681
This is my discovery.

257
00:25:26,885 --> 00:25:28,944
I'm only here
to help my friend.

258
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,147
You can't help him.

259
00:25:31,222 --> 00:25:33,247
You're wasting your time
reading it.

260
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:36,593
It has power.

261
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:38,959
It is power.

262
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,021
The ultimate power.

263
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:44,761
Your friend
just got too close.

264
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,614
No one leaves here
before me.

265
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:10,349
We developed this
to test remote viewing capabilities.

266
00:26:10,427 --> 00:26:13,294
It works much like
a card trick.

267
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,888
You tap the monitor where
the saucer image appears,

268
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:18,559
when it appears,
or when you think it does.

269
00:26:18,635 --> 00:26:21,069
Okay?

270
00:26:21,137 --> 00:26:23,298
Who are you gonna call?

271
00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:34,810
Now.

272
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,819
Now. Now.

273
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:41,152
Now. Now.

274
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,352
Now. Now.

275
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:49,125
- Now.
- All right, Agent Mulder. Fine.

276
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:52,032
You're at about
five percent accuracy.

277
00:26:52,101 --> 00:26:54,331
I'm assuming that's low.

278
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:59,603
Yeah. At the C.I.A., a high degree
of ability was 20 percent.

279
00:26:59,676 --> 00:27:02,270
- Twenty-five percent was extraordinary.
- But I see them in my head.

280
00:27:02,345 --> 00:27:05,781
You saw his ability earlier.
It was you who pointed it out.

281
00:27:05,849 --> 00:27:09,546
Well, our tests show that some people
have psychic ability, sure.

282
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:12,952
I mean, E.S.P., clairvoyance,
remote viewing.

283
00:27:13,022 --> 00:27:15,217
But it was never attributed
to aliens.

284
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:17,885
You don't want to believe.

285
00:27:20,697 --> 00:27:22,631
You're not looking
hard enough.

286
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,474
One more time...
faster.

287
00:28:00,336 --> 00:28:02,201
He's ahead of the images.

288
00:28:03,673 --> 00:28:05,937
He's anticipating them.

289
00:28:58,828 --> 00:29:01,626
They've come back!

290
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,632
They were dead!

291
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,634
They've come back to life!

292
00:29:07,236 --> 00:29:09,295
The ship...
it brought them back to life!

293
00:29:38,601 --> 00:29:40,967
We have to get
to the police.

294
00:29:41,037 --> 00:29:44,268
That is where I am going.
This is the road to Abajan.

295
00:29:47,308 --> 00:29:49,139
- Stop!

296
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:58,717
That was him!

297
00:29:58,786 --> 00:30:02,722
That was the man I saw in the tent...
in the road.

298
00:30:10,097 --> 00:30:12,793
Some truths
are not for you.

299
00:30:23,277 --> 00:30:26,144
- Are you all right?

300
00:30:26,214 --> 00:30:30,014
- Oh, God. What are you doing?
- You were cold.

301
00:30:30,084 --> 00:30:32,575
I was just feeling to see
if you were still alive.

302
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:34,814
- What happened to you?
- To me?

303
00:30:34,889 --> 00:30:37,824
You slammed on the brakes.
There was a man.

304
00:30:37,892 --> 00:30:39,757
- That's right... in the road.
- No.

305
00:30:39,827 --> 00:30:43,923
He was right there, sitting
right where you are in your seat.

306
00:30:47,368 --> 00:30:50,428
The men were right.
This is a bad sign.

307
00:30:52,006 --> 00:30:54,236
A sign to give up.

308
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:02,711
- Turn us around.
- Not back to the beach.

309
00:31:04,018 --> 00:31:07,181
No.
I'm going home.

310
00:31:11,225 --> 00:31:13,159
Agent Mulder?

311
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,296
Agent Mulder, I don't know
if you can hear me,

312
00:31:18,366 --> 00:31:21,199
but we're gonna try
to get you out of here.

313
00:31:25,139 --> 00:31:27,073
A.M. nurse is on
in five minutes.

314
00:31:27,141 --> 00:31:29,439
- We gotta move.
- I don't think he's in any shape.

315
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,444
I'm gonna hit him
pretty hard.

316
00:31:31,512 --> 00:31:33,605
Maybe we can get him
on his feet.

317
00:31:33,681 --> 00:31:36,775
- What are you doing?
- Look, I know what you're doing.

318
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:40,184
- I'm trying to help him.
- This isn't about him.

319
00:31:40,254 --> 00:31:42,484
It's about you. It's about revenge
against the government...

320
00:31:42,556 --> 00:31:44,490
for trying to destroy
your life.

321
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:46,992
I was destroyed to protect what Mulder
knew all along. Now he's the proof.

322
00:31:47,061 --> 00:31:50,588
- He's the X-File.
- We can't just keep
shooting him full of drugs.

323
00:31:50,665 --> 00:31:53,498
- It's gone too far.
- How far should it go?

324
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:55,797
How far
would Mulder go?

325
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:31,294
- Hey, what's going on here?

326
00:32:31,372 --> 00:32:33,738
Let me see your hands.
Hands!

327
00:32:36,143 --> 00:32:38,111
Step away.

328
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:40,306
Agent Fowley, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

329
00:32:40,381 --> 00:32:44,317
What am I doing?
What are you doing, sir, with this?

330
00:32:46,354 --> 00:32:48,618
I want you
to face the wall.

331
00:32:48,689 --> 00:32:51,351
Do you hear me?
Face the wall!

332
00:32:53,761 --> 00:32:57,322
- Let me explain.
- What was this man given?

333
00:32:57,398 --> 00:32:59,332
What was in
this syringe?

334
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,334
Phenytoin.

335
00:33:01,402 --> 00:33:03,495
Let me tell you
what it does.

336
00:33:03,571 --> 00:33:05,801
How much did you give him?
What dosage was this?

337
00:33:05,873 --> 00:33:07,807
- Let me tell you why we did it.

338
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,908
He's going into seizure!

339
00:33:14,115 --> 00:33:16,583
Watch his head!

340
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,584
Mr. Mulder?

341
00:33:19,954 --> 00:33:21,945
Hold him.
Hold him.

342
00:33:40,773 --> 00:33:42,900
Dr. Barnes?

343
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:51,215
Dr. Barnes?

344
00:33:55,521 --> 00:33:58,217
- I'm so sorry.

345
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:18,142
I know what's happened to you.

346
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,508
I know what
you're suffering from.

347
00:34:21,947 --> 00:34:24,245
I've been sitting back
and watching.

348
00:34:24,316 --> 00:34:26,250
I know you know.

349
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,582
I know you know
about me.

350
00:34:30,656 --> 00:34:33,056
That my loyalties
aren't just to you,

351
00:34:35,127 --> 00:34:37,618
but to a man
you've grown to despise.

352
00:34:41,867 --> 00:34:44,392
You have your reasons.

353
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:48,907
But as you look inside me now,
you know that I have mine.

354
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,144
Fox?

355
00:34:55,514 --> 00:34:57,448
Fox, I love you.

356
00:34:59,185 --> 00:35:01,119
I've loved you
for so long.

357
00:35:03,756 --> 00:35:05,690
You know that too.

358
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:09,826
And I won't let you die...

359
00:35:09,895 --> 00:35:12,659
to prove what you are...
to prove what's inside you.

360
00:35:12,732 --> 00:35:15,826
There's no need
to prove it.

361
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:17,835
It's been known
for so long.

362
00:35:22,108 --> 00:35:24,133
Now we can be together.

363
00:36:20,299 --> 00:36:22,426
-  Where is he?

364
00:36:25,137 --> 00:36:28,402
- Is he still in the hospital?
- Where have you been?

365
00:36:28,474 --> 00:36:31,204
Is he still at
Georgetown Memorial?

366
00:36:31,277 --> 00:36:34,769
- You can't get to him.
- Do you know where he is,
or don't you?

367
00:36:34,847 --> 00:36:37,748
He's in the neuro psych ward,
but it's no good, Agent Scully.

368
00:36:37,817 --> 00:36:41,344
- Agent Scully!
- I have been on a plane for 22 hours.

369
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,856
- I have to see him.
- Then I think you should know
what you're gonna see,

370
00:36:44,924 --> 00:36:47,392
if you can even get
on the ward.

371
00:36:49,595 --> 00:36:51,529
There's been some trouble.

372
00:36:55,634 --> 00:36:57,568
What kind of trouble?

373
00:36:57,636 --> 00:37:00,605
- I got this man Kritschgau involved.
- Kritschgau?

374
00:37:03,475 --> 00:37:05,739
It's a long story,
but it ended badly.

375
00:37:05,811 --> 00:37:08,939
They've got Mulder under security now
around the clock.

376
00:37:09,014 --> 00:37:11,039
I take full responsibility.

377
00:37:11,116 --> 00:37:13,778
Responsibility for what?

378
00:37:13,853 --> 00:37:16,083
He can't even communicate,
Agent Scully.

379
00:37:16,155 --> 00:37:19,181
They won't treat him because
they don't know what's wrong with him.

380
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:29,467
They said he was dying.
I had to do something.

381
00:37:29,535 --> 00:37:31,901
He's not dying.

382
00:37:31,971 --> 00:37:34,235
I'm afraid it's true.

383
00:37:34,306 --> 00:37:37,332
He's not dying.

384
00:37:37,409 --> 00:37:39,673
He is more alive
than he's ever been.

385
00:37:39,745 --> 00:37:42,578
He's more alive than
his body can withstand.

386
00:37:42,648 --> 00:37:47,847
And what's causing it
may be extraterrestrial in origin.

387
00:37:50,322 --> 00:37:52,415
I know.

388
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,324
But there's nothing
to be done about it.

389
00:38:06,338 --> 00:38:08,272
They're going to
deny you access.

390
00:38:09,608 --> 00:38:11,542
Maybe as his partner,

391
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:14,010
but not as his doctor.

392
00:39:02,894 --> 00:39:05,692
He's alive.

393
00:39:05,763 --> 00:39:08,823
He's come back to life.

394
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,834
Holy Mother of God!

395
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:26,776
Hello?

396
00:40:19,404 --> 00:40:22,396
Please.

397
00:40:22,473 --> 00:40:25,271
I need to see him.

398
00:40:25,343 --> 00:40:27,277
I'm begging you, please.

399
00:40:30,314 --> 00:40:32,248
Thank you.

400
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:47,323
Mulder, it's me.

401
00:40:47,398 --> 00:40:50,265
I know that
you can hear me.

402
00:40:50,334 --> 00:40:53,599
If you can just
give me some sign.

403
00:40:57,809 --> 00:41:00,004
I want you to know
where I've been...

404
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:03,544
what I found.

405
00:41:05,983 --> 00:41:08,315
I think that
if you know,

406
00:41:08,386 --> 00:41:10,650
that you could find a way
to hold on.

407
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:15,691
I need you to hold on.

408
00:41:20,498 --> 00:41:23,160
I found a key...

409
00:41:23,234 --> 00:41:25,225
the key...

410
00:41:25,303 --> 00:41:28,204
to every question
that has ever been asked.

411
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:34,374
It's a puzzle.

412
00:41:34,445 --> 00:41:38,643
But the pieces are there
for us to put together.

413
00:41:38,716 --> 00:41:43,312
And I know that they can save you
if you can just hold on.

414
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:48,156
Mulder?

415
00:41:53,831 --> 00:41:55,765
Please.

416
00:41:59,804 --> 00:42:01,738
Hold on.
