00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,016
She's no Super Soldier.

178
00:09:59,124 --> 00:10:00,091
Absolutely not.

179
00:10:00,192 --> 00:10:02,126
Not a chance.
Who told you that?

180
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,785
[Morris]
This is pointless.

181
00:10:05,998 --> 00:10:08,489
These three monkeys
couldn't find stink in an outhouse.

182
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,532
Why are we even here?

183
00:10:09,635 --> 00:10:11,626
You son of a...

184
00:10:14,206 --> 00:10:16,037
Hey, let me at him!
I'll kill him!

185
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:18,166
- I'll hold him down!
- Whoa, fellas...

186
00:10:18,277 --> 00:10:20,905
- You've got a nerve coming here.
- Miserable son of a bitch.

187
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:23,381
Told you they wouldn't help.

188
00:10:23,482 --> 00:10:24,506
[Doggett]
All right...

189
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:25,844
everybody just shut up.

190
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:27,543
This man
is a professional liar.

191
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:28,677
Every word out
of his mouth.

192
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:29,845
[Langly]
He's a scam artist.

193
00:10:29,955 --> 00:10:31,445
He used us to track Yves down
a year ago.

194
00:10:31,557 --> 00:10:33,752
[Frohike]
And then he abducted her.

195
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:35,724
Which is why I know
what happened to her.

196
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:36,726
[Clears Throat]

197
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:38,524
I facilitated a meeting, is all.

198
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,860
And the man
I was working for?

199
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:41,955
I didn't know in advance...

200
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:43,261
what he was planning to do
to her.

201
00:10:43,368 --> 00:10:45,336
Not my finest hour,
I'll admit it.

202
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,234
Every word out
of his mouth.

203
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:48,670
[Morris]
Agents...

204
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:51,174
I'm telling you, you don't want
these three involved.

205
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,040
And they don't even have their
ridiculous Tinkertoy gizmos.

206
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:56,671
This place is like
<i>How the Grinch Stole Radio Shack.</i>

207
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,977
[Doggett] All right,
you three know this woman.

208
00:10:59,084 --> 00:11:00,142
I want your help.

209
00:11:00,252 --> 00:11:03,881
I need to track down
this Yves Adele Harlow.

210
00:11:41,126 --> 00:11:43,253
Knock, please.

211
00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:53,195
Oh.

212
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:58,475
My office hours are 3:00 to 5:00
Mondays and Fridays.

213
00:11:58,577 --> 00:12:01,705
You'll make time for me,
Professor.

214
00:12:06,418 --> 00:12:07,407
[Air Hisses]

215
00:12:18,063 --> 00:12:19,997
Douglas, you ready to go?

216
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:23,796
Douglas?

217
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,539

00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:16,779

What name do we look under?

219
00:13:16,888 --> 00:13:18,549
Try our old standby...

220
00:13:18,657 --> 00:13:20,818
different anagrams
of Lee Harvey Oswald.

221
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:24,555
"Area 51 Exposé"...ooh!

222
00:13:24,663 --> 00:13:26,528
Where's your new issue?
This one's a year old.

223
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:28,759
Back off, Skeezix.

224
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:31,267
You'll never find her that way.

225
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,205
[Beeps]

226
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:38,743
He's right... no anagrams
for Yves Adele Harlow.

227
00:13:40,812 --> 00:13:42,939
- So, who's Joey?
- What?

228
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:45,708
Joey Ramone?

229
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:48,752
Leader of the greatest punk rock
band in human history?

230
00:13:48,854 --> 00:13:50,253
Now shut up.

231
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:53,682
[Snickering]

232
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,384
What?

233
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,325
What are you, 34, 35?

234
00:14:00,432 --> 00:14:02,297
Why don't you cut your hair
and grow up, huh?

235
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:03,698
Need I remind you, Fletcher...

236
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,565
that Doggett and Reyes aren't
here to save you.

237
00:14:05,671 --> 00:14:09,072
Yeah, well, get yourself
a real hero, anyway...

238
00:14:09,174 --> 00:14:11,404
not some dead
teeny-bopper.

239
00:14:14,713 --> 00:14:17,614
You want to know why
Joey Ramone's my hero?

240
00:14:17,716 --> 00:14:21,948
'Cause people like you never
managed to grind him down.

241
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:23,749
They never stole his spirit.

242
00:14:23,855 --> 00:14:27,621
He never gave in,
never gave up, and never sold out.

243
00:14:27,726 --> 00:14:29,694
Right till his last breath.

244
00:14:29,795 --> 00:14:30,727
[Scoffs]

245
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,992
And he's <i>not</i> dead.

246
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:37,262
Guys like that,
they live forever.

247
00:14:37,369 --> 00:14:38,393
Langly...

248
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,095
just ignore him.

249
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:48,410
[Sighs]

250
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,913
Look, if we have to work
together, let's work together.

251
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,779
We don't have
to work together.

252
00:14:52,884 --> 00:14:56,012
Well, watching you three try and
find your butts with both hands...

253
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:57,520
is not my idea of a fun time.

254
00:14:57,622 --> 00:14:59,954
Now, wouldn't it be easier
tracking Yves...

255
00:15:00,058 --> 00:15:01,958
if you knew her real name?

256
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,457
You know her real name?

257
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:08,658
Lois Runce.

258
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,329
Lois Runce? Aha.

259
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:15,963
I'm telling you the truth, boys.

260
00:15:16,074 --> 00:15:17,598
Well, if you were,
it'd be a first.

261
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:18,641
[<i>Knocking</i>]

262
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:23,504
Nobody knows about that door.

263
00:15:23,615 --> 00:15:25,048
That's our secret door.

264
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,345
Does Lois know about it?

265
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:28,817
Yves?

266
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,232

00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:06,483
Jimmy?

269
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,525
How you feeling, man?

270
00:16:08,627 --> 00:16:09,992
[Morris]
Oh, right.

271
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,188
The old errand boy.

272
00:16:12,297 --> 00:16:15,027
The guy used to intern
for you losers, right?

273
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:16,862
I wondered what happened to you.

274
00:16:16,968 --> 00:16:18,868
Why is he here?

275
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,267
[Byers]
FBI business.

276
00:16:20,372 --> 00:16:23,739
It's a long story.

277
00:16:23,842 --> 00:16:25,810
Where the hell you been,
big guy?

278
00:16:27,712 --> 00:16:30,681
Zurich. Then Malta.

279
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:35,515
Then Yemen.
And just now New Jersey.

280
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,783
It's been
a real geology lesson.

281
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,223
I ran out of money,
so I hitchhiked here...

282
00:16:42,327 --> 00:16:43,692
then snuck in the back...

283
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:47,094
'cause I didn't know
if the place was being watched.

285
00:16:54,906 --> 00:16:57,841
I just had to see you guys.

286
00:16:57,943 --> 00:16:59,672
It's about Lois.

287
00:17:02,914 --> 00:17:04,506
Lois Runce?

288
00:17:06,084 --> 00:17:07,312
That's Yves's real name.

289
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:10,388
I told you so.

290
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,716
Hey, wait a minute.

291
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:14,087
You tracked her
all over the world?

292
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:15,625
You?

[Sighs]

294
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:20,697
Mr. Brainpower here
is lucky to be alive.

295
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,768
Why did you send him?
Were you trying to get him killed?

296
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,166
He sent himself to find Yves.

297
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,636
We tried to talk him out of it.

298
00:17:27,739 --> 00:17:30,833
Yeah, and now
I almost wish you had.

299
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,849
Jimmy, what is it?
Are you all right?

300
00:17:37,949 --> 00:17:40,577
Last night I traced her...

301
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,950
to a little college
in New Jersey.

302
00:17:44,055 --> 00:17:48,992
It's the closest I've been
in a year of searching.

303
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:52,154
I saw her.

304
00:17:52,264 --> 00:17:54,562
I actually laid my eyes on her...

305
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,897
I called to her...

306
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:01,605
but she ran.

307
00:18:02,807 --> 00:18:06,675
Later on, I found out...

308
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:13,377
Guys, I think
she murdered somebody.

309
00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:15,740
One down.

310
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:31,784

311
00:19:31,896 --> 00:19:35,423
I'm Agent Reyes,
and this is Agent Doggett.

312
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:37,057
Is this the woman
you saw last night?

313
00:19:40,205 --> 00:19:41,934
It was dark.

314
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,507
It could have been her.

315
00:19:43,608 --> 00:19:45,405
Do you have her in custody?

316
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,738
We're working on it.

317
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:49,609
Sir, what can you tell us
about your friend?

318
00:19:49,748 --> 00:19:52,911
Have any reason why
he may have been targeted?

319
00:19:53,018 --> 00:19:54,417
Absolutely none.

320
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:57,750
Douglas was a wonderful teacher
and an even better researcher.

321
00:19:57,856 --> 00:19:59,050
What did he research?

322
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,385
Elasmobranchii...

323
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:03,825
sharks, rays and skates.

324
00:20:03,928 --> 00:20:05,259
He was a marine biologist?

325
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:07,331
An immunologist.

326
00:20:07,432 --> 00:20:09,400
Sharks have a remarkable
immune system.

327
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:12,061
Toxins that would kill
nearly any other vertebrate...

328
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,660
pass right through them.

329
00:20:13,772 --> 00:20:15,569
So he did medical research?

330
00:20:18,943 --> 00:20:21,741
Douglas wanted
to save the world.

331
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:35,259
Cheer up, Gomer.

332
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,327
Bringing the whole room down.

333
00:20:36,428 --> 00:20:37,292
This is a computer,
Langly.

334
00:20:37,395 --> 00:20:38,692
Com-pu-ter.

335
00:20:38,797 --> 00:20:39,821
Step away before
you embarrass yourself.

336
00:20:39,931 --> 00:20:41,159
Always a pleasure, Kimmy.

337
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:42,665
Yeah, yeah.

338
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:47,466
So, then, how do you wish
to partake of my hacking genius?

339
00:20:47,572 --> 00:20:48,596
Thanks toJimmy...

340
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,105
we know Yves's real name.

341
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,699
Hey, I told you
before he did.

342
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:55,803
Jimmy also told us
what kind of car she's driving...

343
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:57,848
silver X5 with New York plates.

344
00:20:57,949 --> 00:21:00,577
Really? Way to go, special ed.

345
00:21:01,986 --> 00:21:03,578
The New Jersey Turnpike
has video cameras...

346
00:21:03,688 --> 00:21:04,586
at every tollbooth.

347
00:21:04,689 --> 00:21:05,815
Langly hacked the system...

348
00:21:05,924 --> 00:21:07,357
and spotted her
southbound at Newark.

349
00:21:07,459 --> 00:21:08,357
Somewhat creative.

350
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,449
We spotted her again...

351
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,495
going through
the Fort McHenry Tunnel.

352
00:21:11,596 --> 00:21:13,359
She passed through
not 20 minutes ago.

353
00:21:13,465 --> 00:21:15,092
We're betting
she's headed for D.C.

354
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,896
We're going to try to intercept her
with your help.

355
00:21:18,002 --> 00:21:19,196
Think you might find...

356
00:21:19,304 --> 00:21:20,771
a military satellite
you could piggyback...

357
00:21:20,872 --> 00:21:22,305
give us a bird's-eye view
of the Beltway?

358
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:24,238
Intriguing.

359
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:27,573
Stand aside, ladies.

360
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,374
We'll be on the cell.

361
00:21:29,481 --> 00:21:30,675
I got shotgun.

362
00:21:30,782 --> 00:21:32,306
Dream on.
You're staying here.

363
00:21:35,386 --> 00:21:37,411
We need somebody
we can trust...

364
00:21:37,522 --> 00:21:39,422
keeping an eye
on Fletcher.

365
00:21:39,524 --> 00:21:41,355
I'm on it.

366
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:51,900
So, how'd you like Malta?

367
00:21:52,036 --> 00:21:56,234
The only thing I can say
for sure is what killed him.

368
00:21:56,341 --> 00:21:57,501
He was injected...

369
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:00,442
with some sort of
tiny poison pellet...

370
00:22:00,545 --> 00:22:03,946
but the wound in his chest
was postmortem.

371
00:22:04,048 --> 00:22:05,345
What is that?

372
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,974
That's what I said.

373
00:22:07,085 --> 00:22:08,746
My best guess is bioluminescence...

374
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:11,344
but I'm still waiting
to hear back from our lab.

375
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:15,415
Bioluminescence, as in the stuff
that makes lightning bugs glow?

376
00:22:15,527 --> 00:22:17,961
Lightning bugs, plankton,
jellyfish...

but generally
not dead college professors.

378
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:23,965
So, what? This stuff
was put on postmortem?

379
00:22:24,068 --> 00:22:28,402
No, as near as I can tell,
it bled out of him.

380
00:22:28,506 --> 00:22:30,906
It gets weirder still.

381
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:32,806
When I opened him up...

382
00:22:32,911 --> 00:22:35,539
I found adhesions that indicate
past surgery...

383
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:39,174
so I'm figuring I'll find he had
a bypass or a pacemaker.

384
00:22:39,284 --> 00:22:43,618
Instead, I find... this.

385
00:22:47,592 --> 00:22:49,082
Looks like cartilage.

386
00:22:49,194 --> 00:22:50,320
It is.

387
00:22:50,428 --> 00:22:53,625
It was living tissue
grafted into him.

388
00:22:53,731 --> 00:22:56,598
I have absolutely no idea why.

389
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:06,502
It held something.

390
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:08,101
Something that's
now missing.

391
00:23:11,716 --> 00:23:13,741
Could that be the purpose
of this wound?

392
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:16,513
A little
ad hoc surgery?

393
00:23:16,621 --> 00:23:19,089
Maybe that was the very purpose
of the murder.

394
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,351
Whatever was inside him,
she removed it.

395
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:25,623
What the hell was inside him?

396
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,062
I have no clue.

397
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:30,327

402
00:23:37,775 --> 00:23:39,640
You're looking at me oddly.

403
00:23:39,744 --> 00:23:42,212
Perhaps because you've been known
to lie on occasion.

404
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:46,145
Yeah, well, I'm
not lying now.

00:30:16,807 --> 00:30:19,275
genetically altered
to a high degree of precision.

534
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:21,811
The way the vessel
is decaying inside of him...

535
00:30:21,912 --> 00:30:23,243
is virtually
clocklike.

536
00:30:23,347 --> 00:30:27,545
It will lose integrity
and rupture at 8:00 tonight.

537
00:30:27,652 --> 00:30:29,279
Five hours from now?

538
00:30:29,387 --> 00:30:30,718
[Yves] This virus,
once it's airborne...

539
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:32,413
its kill radius is five
or six miles...

540
00:30:32,523 --> 00:30:33,581
depending on the winds.

541
00:30:33,724 --> 00:30:35,715
Potentially,
it could kill thousands...

542
00:30:35,826 --> 00:30:37,350
tens of thousands.

543
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:40,259
Fletcher...

544
00:30:40,364 --> 00:30:42,423
I know you're a dirtbag...

545
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:44,558
but, still, how could you
be a party to this?

546
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:46,466
[Yves] Fletcher's a con man,
not a killer.

547
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:47,730
He didn't know about it.

548
00:30:50,908 --> 00:30:55,845
Providing all this is true,
how do we track this man down?

549
00:31:00,751 --> 00:31:01,775
Kimmy,
zoom in more.

550
00:31:01,886 --> 00:31:02,944
Zoom in.

551
00:31:03,054 --> 00:31:04,544
Back off, kibitzer,
I'm doing it.

552
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:05,747
This thing is slower...

553
00:31:05,856 --> 00:31:07,790
than Stumpy,
my one-legged granny.

554
00:31:07,892 --> 00:31:09,985
Where did you get
this dinosaur turd?

555
00:31:10,094 --> 00:31:11,891
Stop bellyaching
and work.

556
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:14,089
Those things will
kill you, you know.

557
00:31:14,198 --> 00:31:17,292
Yeah, that's why I quit
20 years ago.

558
00:31:17,401 --> 00:31:19,426
You want one?

559
00:31:21,939 --> 00:31:25,534
So you're too broke
to publish, huh?

560
00:31:25,643 --> 00:31:27,440
Pencil neck told me.

561
00:31:29,146 --> 00:31:30,704
It's a shame.

562
00:31:30,815 --> 00:31:33,943
This little rag always
was such a hoot.

563
00:31:34,051 --> 00:31:35,746
I'm going to miss it.

564
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:38,845
But, hey, the world
spins on, right?

565
00:31:38,956 --> 00:31:41,982
Maybe saving it is
a younger man's game.

566
00:31:42,093 --> 00:31:43,856
Or a woman's.

567
00:31:50,601 --> 00:31:52,694
Maybe it is.

568
00:31:54,772 --> 00:31:57,400
Got to admit, Byers,
it hasn't exactly been our year.

569
00:31:57,508 --> 00:31:59,237
And to top
it all off...

570
00:31:59,343 --> 00:32:01,903
we screwed the pooch
pretty good today.

571
00:32:03,781 --> 00:32:05,544
Maybe we should
pack it in.

572
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:07,776
And do what instead?

573
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:10,046
We never gave up.

574
00:32:10,154 --> 00:32:11,849
We never will.

575
00:32:11,956 --> 00:32:12,980
In the end...

576
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,684
if that's the best
they can say about us...

577
00:32:15,793 --> 00:32:16,817
it'll do.

578
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:17,950
[Langly]
I got him!

579
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:19,689
[Kimmy]
It's my hack, Langly.

580
00:32:19,797 --> 00:32:20,695
I got him.

581
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:21,787
We got him,
all right?

582
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:24,060
Our bad guy just rented
a blue Corolla...

583
00:32:24,168 --> 00:32:26,068
under his alias,
Leonard Southall.

584
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,730
We just picked him up
on Kimmy's satellite.

585
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,670
[Kimmy] Yeah, hauling north
like a bat out of hell.

586
00:32:30,775 --> 00:32:33,710
New Jersey Turnpike,
30 miles south of Newark.

587
00:32:33,811 --> 00:32:36,336
I think I know
where he's headed.

Byers speaking.

591
00:33:08,045 --> 00:33:09,478
Byers? John Doggett.

592
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,810
Agent Doggett,
do you have him?

593
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:14,749
Oh, yeah, we got him.

594
00:33:14,852 --> 00:33:16,717

596
00:33:19,056 --> 00:33:21,149
whatever name
she's telling you?

597
00:33:21,258 --> 00:33:23,226
Completely. Why?

598
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:25,227
Because the doctors here
have run every kind...

599
00:33:25,329 --> 00:33:27,763
of imaging on this guy Southall
and come up snake eyes.

600
00:33:27,865 --> 00:33:31,198
No virus, no cartilage vessel
in his chest, nothing.

601
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:32,428
They found nothing.

602
00:33:32,536 --> 00:33:34,663
That doesn't make sense.

603
00:33:34,772 --> 00:33:36,865

They're absolutely certain?

604
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:38,874
One hundred percent.

00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:41,103
Agent Reyes and I
are looking like...

606
00:33:41,212 --> 00:33:43,077
a couple of fools
on this one.

607
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,341
There must be something
we missed.

608
00:33:45,449 --> 00:33:48,316
All I can tell you is,
we got the wrong guy.

609
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,290
There must be
a second man.

610
00:33:55,392 --> 00:33:56,450
I know there is.

611
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,528
It's basic Terrorism 101.

612
00:33:58,629 --> 00:33:59,994
Except we don't
know his name...

613
00:34:00,097 --> 00:34:01,462
and we don't
know his target.

614
00:34:01,565 --> 00:34:03,590
And we've got
one hour to find him.

615
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:35,126
Good evening.

616
00:34:36,233 --> 00:34:38,292
You're good.

617
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,901
All my information pointed
to that man Leonard Southall.

618
00:34:45,009 --> 00:34:47,910
He goes by an alias, he traveled
to Washington on this very day.

619
00:34:48,012 --> 00:34:50,207
Clearly,
he's involved somehow.

620
00:34:50,314 --> 00:34:51,713
He must be.

621
00:34:51,815 --> 00:34:53,840
He made a beeline right back
to that biology department...

622
00:34:53,951 --> 00:34:55,543
where the dead professor worked.

623
00:34:55,653 --> 00:34:56,984
It's their base of operation.

624
00:34:57,087 --> 00:34:58,782
[Langly] Yeah, so if Southall
is involved...

625
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:01,323
and yet he doesn't have
the virus inside of him...

626
00:35:01,425 --> 00:35:05,054
So how exactly does
he fit into their plan?

627
00:35:05,162 --> 00:35:06,754
Three-card monte.

628
00:35:06,864 --> 00:35:08,456
You ever played it?

629
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:10,226
You have now.

630
00:35:10,334 --> 00:35:11,801
What's that
supposed to mean?

631
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:13,927
It means these guys have
you running after the ace...

632
00:35:14,038 --> 00:35:15,733
when you should be
chasing the queen.

633
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,238
Oh, my God.

634
00:35:17,341 --> 00:35:19,741
Southall is the decoy.

635
00:35:19,843 --> 00:35:21,470
That's all he is.

636
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:22,636
You were hot
on their trail...

637
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:25,146
so they gave you
someone else to follow.

638
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:27,342
I thought you didn't know
anything about terrorists.

639
00:35:27,451 --> 00:35:28,679
I don't.

640
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:30,913
But, boy, do I know scams.

641
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:33,785
I wasn't a Man in Black
all those years for nothing.

642
00:35:33,891 --> 00:35:36,291
They made you work
at finding Southall...

643
00:35:36,393 --> 00:35:38,020
which tells me
the real guy...

644
00:35:38,128 --> 00:35:40,153
is hiding in plain sight,
right out in the open.

645
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:41,731
A friend
of the dead professor?

646
00:35:41,832 --> 00:35:42,992
A co-worker maybe.

647
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,194
The man who saw me through
the professor's window.

648
00:35:46,303 --> 00:35:48,703
The one who identified me.

649
00:35:48,806 --> 00:35:51,206

650
00:35:51,308 --> 00:35:53,868

and government representatives.

is our goal this evening...

00:35:56,647 --> 00:35:58,979
coming together as one.

00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:01,347
Those words are easily spoken.

654
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:03,147
But guiding our missile
into that fugitive...

655
00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:06,416
and imponderable target
is hard indeed.

00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:37,933
Jimmy, don't.

713
00:39:38,035 --> 00:39:39,832
It's airtight.

714
00:39:39,937 --> 00:39:42,531
They're already exposed.

715
00:39:50,647 --> 00:39:52,512
No, guys.

716
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:06,059
Buddy, fight the good fight.

717
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:10,898
Both of you.

718
00:40:14,071 --> 00:40:15,629
Never give up.

719
00:40:54,711 --> 00:40:56,872
<i>Vaya con Dios, amigos.</i>

720
00:41:14,598 --> 00:41:16,031
Arlington.

721
00:41:16,133 --> 00:41:18,465
You must've pulled
some big strings...

722
00:41:18,568 --> 00:41:20,433
to get those guys in here.

723
00:41:22,873 --> 00:41:24,135
It's the least
I could do.

724
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:34,315
You ready?

725
00:41:35,919 --> 00:41:37,386
Yeah.

726
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:43,991
Dana.

727
00:41:44,094 --> 00:41:45,584
I'll catch up.

728
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:00,101
They meant so much to me.

729
00:42:03,413 --> 00:42:05,313
I'm not sure
if they ever really knew.

730
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:13,081
Nobody knew...
what heroes they were.

731
00:42:18,362 --> 00:42:21,195
It's not right.

732
00:42:24,034 --> 00:42:25,467
It's not.

733
00:42:25,569 --> 00:42:27,002
[Morris]
No, it's not.

734
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,639
Langly said to me...

735
00:42:35,746 --> 00:42:38,715
the ones who never give up,
they never die.

736
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:43,984
I still don't know
what that means.

737
00:42:47,924 --> 00:42:49,585
That means that like
everyone buried here...

738
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:52,628
the world is a better place
for them having been in it.

739
00:42:56,666 --> 00:42:59,965
It means that
they're gone...

740
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:02,868
but they live on
through us all.

741
00:43:59,996 --> 00:44:01,759

<i>I made this.</i>
