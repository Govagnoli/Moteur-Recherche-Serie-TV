1
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:15,113
Three.

2
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,299
Give me two.

3
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,305
Two.

4
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,580
Can I have five cards,
please?

5
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,518
Five?
What, are you serious?

6
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,787
Four's the limit.
Let's see your ace.

7
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:05,558
If Mr. Weems wants five,

8
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,759
give him five.

9
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,777
Dealer takes two.

10
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,950
Four.

11
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:29,854
Nah.

12
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:43,293
- How much is that?
-  Four grand keeps you in...

13
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,133
you and your five
shiny new cards.

14
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,777
There's 4,000.

15
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,714
And four more.

16
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,984
Let's make this interesting.

17
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,785
I'm raising you 15 large.

18
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:10,055
I wouldn't do that.
This is all I need.

19
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:16,026
You're gonna need Depends...
after you see this hand.

20
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,510
Now we show each other
our cards?

21
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,861
Four kings.

22
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,760
That's a straight flush,
right?

23
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,978
Beginner's luck.

24
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:06,650
- What the hell
do you think you're doin'?
- Going home.

25
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,051
No, no.
Not so fast.

26
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:13,091
We expect a chance to win
some of our money back.

27
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,799
Guys, there's over
a hundred thousand dollars here.

28
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,631
You're damn right there's over
a hundred thousand dollars there.

29
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,940
A hundred thousand's
all I need.

30
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,568
Sorry.

31
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:34,010
I had fun, though.

32
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,607
Where can I cash out?

33
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,987
Guys, I think we're going up
instead of down.

34
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,339
Guys?

35
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,638
Guys, this is not what
I meant by "cashing out." Hey!

36
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,847
Hey!

37
00:06:12,971 --> 00:06:14,905
-  Hello?

38
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:17,874
Mulder, it's me. What now?

39
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:20,104
- Are you in Chicago?
- Yes, I'm in Chicago.

40
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:23,910
I'm on the northeast corner of Seventh
and Hunter just like you asked.

41
00:06:23,982 --> 00:06:27,748
Only you're not here.
So where are you?

42
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,118
Oh, around.

43
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,123
- Yeah?
- Hey, nice outfit.

44
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,194
Hey.

45
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:39,753
What's down there?

46
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,665
Before you check out down there,
check out up there.

47
00:06:44,436 --> 00:06:47,132
The top two floors are leased
to oneJimmy Catrona,

48
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,266
- Whose name you might be familiar with.
- Organized crime.

49
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:54,369
The Bureau's been trying to build
a racketeering case
against him the past few years.

50
00:06:54,446 --> 00:06:56,437
Gambling, extortion, murder.

51
00:06:56,515 --> 00:07:00,042
Which is why last night there
were two agents parked across
the street in surveillance.

52
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,646
They witnessed a man being thrown
from Catrona's roof at 10:40 p.m.

53
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:08,056
This man fell 30 floors,
plus the distance down this shaft...

54
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:12,188
because these doors just happened to be
open, straight through, nothing but net.

55
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:16,200
- Ouch.
- I'm guessing that's what he said...

56
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:20,170
after he got up, climbed out of here
and scampered off into the night.

57
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:31,576
- Mulder, you keep saying this man.
Who is this man?
- No idea.

58
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,484
He got away. The agents gave chase,
but no clear description.

59
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:38,580
- Was this basement thoroughly searched?
- No.

60
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:41,387
Technically, falling 300 feet
and surviving isn't a crime.

61
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,553
And your theory is?

62
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,393
What if this man had some kind
of special capability...

63
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:49,696
some kind of genetic
predisposition towards...

64
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:52,999
rapid healing
or tissue regeneration?

65
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:57,303
So basically, what we if
were looking for Wile E. Coyote?

66
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,974
You're saying that
he's invulnerable.

67
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:03,071
- Right?
- Yeah.

68
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:08,711
In 1998, there was a British soldier
who plummeted 4,500 feet
when his parachute failed.

69
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:11,551
Then he walked away
with a broken rib.

70
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:15,720
- What's your point?
- My point is that if there's...

71
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:19,230
a wind gust
or a sudden updraft,

72
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,858
and plus if he landed
in exactly the right way...

73
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:25,301
I mean, I don't know.
Maybe he just got lucky.

74
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,497
What if he got
really, really lucky?

75
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,940
That's your big scientific
explanation, Scully?

76
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:33,807
I mean, how many thousands
of variables would have to convene...

77
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:36,814
- In just the right mixture
for that theory to hold water?
- I don't know.

78
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:38,816
No. Thousands.

79
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:40,613
- Mulder?
- Yeah?

80
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:44,247
Look at this.

81
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:48,783
If this cart were on the platform when
he hit, that would explain the wheels.

82
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,954
And what if this whole thing
had just enough give to save his life?

83
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,397
- We'd have to find him to ask.
- Yeah, we'd have to find him.

84
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:20,185
Looks like maybe we found
part of him already.

85
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,997
I think you're taking
a flier here, Mulder.

86
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:39,532
There's gotta be at least 600 people
with prosthetic eyes
in the greater Chicago area.

87
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:44,275
But only this one Henry Weems
made an appointment this morning
to get a new one.

88
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:49,109
Maybe he can't see his way
to the door.

89
00:09:53,992 --> 00:09:56,790
Come on, Scully.
I'm feeling lucky.

90
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:11,842
Can you help me?
It's an emergency.

91
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:23,250
- Ma'am, we're not plumbers.
- I didn't say you were.

92
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,916
I just want the damn water
turned off so I can go to work.

93
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:30,052
You gotta be stronger than me, right?
Valve's under the sink.

94
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,358
Your building super Henry Weems,
he isn't around?

95
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:42,168
Mr. Dependable? Might as well wait
forJimmy Hoffa to show up.

96
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:50,042
You're turning it
the wrong way.

97
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:52,811
- Hey, Richie, sweetheart, back in bed.
- But, Mom...

98
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:55,444
Butts are for sitting,
and I want yours back in bed.

99
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,853
He's right.
Clockwise.

100
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,789
I know that.

101
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:02,952
Clockwise.

102
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:27,050
You okay, Mulder?

103
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,587
Yeah, it's all right.
My ass broke the fall.

104
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:32,953
Guess who I found.

105
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:35,788
Henry Weems, I presume?

106
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,404
Next time leave the plumbing
to a professional.

107
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:55,779
Oh, uh...

108
00:11:55,847 --> 00:12:00,546
Oh, uh, you wanna try
this on for size, Cinderella?

109
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,021
Mr. Weems, why were you hiding
in a vacant apartment?

110
00:12:13,098 --> 00:12:15,259
Not hiding. Avoiding.

111
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,097
- Avoiding whom?
- You people.

112
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,468
Now that you found me,
let's just get it over with.

113
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:23,804
No way am I testifying
againstJimmy Catrona.

114
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:28,039
Last night, Catrona had you thrown
off the roof of 1107 Hunter Avenue.

115
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:30,377
- Is that correct?
- You didn't hear it from me.

116
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,941
I'm not letting you people move me
to Muncie, Indiana to milk cows.

117
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,548
More to the point,
you survived a 300-foot fall,

118
00:12:38,623 --> 00:12:41,217
- Essentially unharmed.

119
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:47,123
I don't know.
Maybe the wind was just right.

120
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,896
And I landed on
a bunch of towels. No biggie.

121
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:54,166
- You got lucky?
- Yeah, I guess.

122
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:57,367
Except you should look
at my bruise.

123
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:03,941
Plus, I didn't get to keep
my poker winnings.

124
00:13:04,015 --> 00:13:07,314
So, that's what you were doing there
last night, playing poker?

125
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:09,979
Catrona thought I was cheating.
I wasn't.

126
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,421
But like I said,
you didn't hear it from me.

127
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,688
Must've been a high-stakes game,
I imagine. Did you win a lot of money?

128
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,854
I don't know.

129
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,864
A little.

130
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:28,371
What is that? Did you make it?

131
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,204
Uh-huh.

132
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:33,767
- It's sort of a hobby.
- Mm-hmm.

133
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:35,836
Mind if I...

134
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:03,871
- Ah. That's craftsmanship.
- Wow.

135
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:06,203
- What does it mean?
- What do you mean what does it mean?

136
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:09,005
- What's...
- It doesn't mean anything.

137
00:14:09,077 --> 00:14:11,375
I just sort of...
I don't know.

138
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:13,971
It's cause and effect.

139
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,750
- So, are... are we done here?
-  Mr. Weems?

140
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:21,050
Can I ask you to reconsider
testifying against Catrona?

141
00:14:21,123 --> 00:14:25,321
- Nope. No way, Jose.
- It would be in your best interest.

142
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:28,329
He's tried to kill you once,
and he will undoubtedly do it again.

143
00:14:28,397 --> 00:14:33,630
- Yeah, we can protect you.
- I'll take my chances.

144
00:14:39,274 --> 00:14:41,742
So, here's the plan
as I see it.

145
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,870
We inform the Chicago
field office about Weems,

146
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:47,848
leaving it to them
to secure his testimony.

147
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,077
You change your clothes,

148
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:54,350
we fly back to D.C. by sunset
and all is right with the world.

149
00:14:54,423 --> 00:14:57,859
Come on, Scully. Are you gonna dump this
case just as it's getting interesting?

150
00:14:57,926 --> 00:15:02,693
Interesting, Mulder, was when
we were looking for Wile E. Coyote.

151
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:06,757
Come on, Mulder. This guy just
got lucky. There's no X-File here.

152
00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:09,531
Maybe his luck is the X-File.

153
00:15:12,874 --> 00:15:14,808
Stairs.

154
00:15:34,463 --> 00:15:36,397
Oh.

155
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,729
Car keys.
Must have lost 'em when I fell.

156
00:16:25,047 --> 00:16:27,515
So, you get many of these?

157
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,885
Okay.

158
00:16:33,922 --> 00:16:36,288
So, uh, they searched
the entire building,

159
00:16:36,358 --> 00:16:39,623
and there's no sign
of Henry Weems.

160
00:16:39,695 --> 00:16:42,220
I'm guessing that
he's on the run.

161
00:16:42,297 --> 00:16:46,097
Our dead man's name is Angelo Bellini,
a.k.a., Angie the Animal.

162
00:16:46,168 --> 00:16:48,762
He's an enforcer
for the Catrona family.

163
00:16:48,837 --> 00:16:51,067
And I don't think
his visit was friendly.

164
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:54,074
You think that Weems
could have killed him in self-defense?

165
00:16:54,142 --> 00:16:57,873
A skinny guy with no depth perception
against a man nicknamed the Animal?

166
00:16:57,946 --> 00:17:01,712
I don't think so. You and I both
know Weems didn't kill anybody.

167
00:17:01,783 --> 00:17:04,911
Besides, we were gone for two minutes.
This guy doesn't have a scratch on him.

168
00:17:04,986 --> 00:17:07,580
I'm thinking it was
a heart attack.

169
00:17:10,926 --> 00:17:13,520
What the hell
happened here, Mulder?

170
00:17:13,595 --> 00:17:15,790
Cause and effect.

171
00:17:15,864 --> 00:17:19,527
- Meaning?
- Okay, so watch.

172
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:23,100
So Bellini kicks down the door.

173
00:17:23,171 --> 00:17:26,629
Poised to kill Weems, right? But just
as he's about to pull the trigger,

174
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,642
a noise startles him.

175
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,941
The buzzer when I buzzed
to be let back in the apartment.

176
00:17:32,013 --> 00:17:35,005
So when he does pull the trigger,
his aim is off.

177
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,176
Right?
And he hits the lamp...

178
00:17:37,252 --> 00:17:39,618
which falls over and knocks over
the ironing board.

179
00:17:39,688 --> 00:17:42,589
So as the bullet ricochets,
Weems dives over the sofa.

180
00:17:42,657 --> 00:17:45,751
Now when Bellini goes for him,
he trips over the ironing board,

181
00:17:45,827 --> 00:17:47,795
bounces off the chair,
flips end-over-end...

182
00:17:47,863 --> 00:17:50,457
and his shoelace gets caught
in the fan... Q.E.D.

183
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,604
Cause and effect.

184
00:17:57,672 --> 00:18:01,164
Seemingly unrelated and
unconnected events and occurrences...

185
00:18:01,243 --> 00:18:04,235
that appear unrelated
and random beforehand,

186
00:18:04,312 --> 00:18:08,271
but which seem to chain-react
in Henry Weems' favor.

187
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:12,286
- Dumb luck?
- Yeah. He seems to have
tapped into it somehow.

188
00:18:12,354 --> 00:18:14,288
He won big at poker,

189
00:18:14,356 --> 00:18:17,723
he survived getting thrown off
a skyscraper, and now this.

190
00:18:22,063 --> 00:18:24,395
- Hang on a second.
- Okay.

191
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:27,526
Hey, your name's Richie,
right?

192
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:29,433
- Yeah.
- I'm Dana.

193
00:18:29,504 --> 00:18:33,304
- Hi.
- Why don't we, uh,
head back to your room.

194
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,570
I'm sure that's what
your mom would want.

195
00:18:44,286 --> 00:18:46,982
So, I'm guessing
you're a sports fan.

196
00:18:49,457 --> 00:18:51,550
Which one's your favorite?

197
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:55,619
Well, it used
to be basketball,

198
00:18:55,697 --> 00:18:59,497
but now the Bulls suck,
so I think maybe baseball.

199
00:18:59,568 --> 00:19:01,661
I like baseball too.

200
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:11,872
Did Henry make this for you?

201
00:19:29,998 --> 00:19:33,957
- That's pretty neat.
- Yeah.

202
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:37,266
He made it for me
when I was in the hospital.

203
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:41,901
He said it's 'cause
everything happens for a reason.

204
00:19:43,945 --> 00:19:47,039
Only just sometimes
it's hard for us to see.

205
00:19:48,683 --> 00:19:51,379
You went to the hospital
because of your liver?

206
00:19:51,453 --> 00:19:54,286
It doesn't work so good.

207
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,819
- Police looking for Henry?
- Yeah.

208
00:20:02,898 --> 00:20:05,264
They just wanna talk to him.

209
00:20:06,835 --> 00:20:09,668
Do you have any idea
where he might have gone?

210
00:20:09,738 --> 00:20:12,104
Mm-mm.

211
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:15,006
Since I got sick,
he hardly ever goes out.

212
00:20:17,913 --> 00:20:20,882
- The boy give you any leads?
- He knows nothing.

213
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:25,342
- Mulder, as to your theory,
- Mm-hmm?

214
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,516
why would the world's
most supernaturally lucky man...

215
00:20:29,591 --> 00:20:32,822
work as a building superintendent?

216
00:20:32,894 --> 00:20:36,125
I mean, why doesn't he just run down
to the Illinois State Lottery,

217
00:20:36,197 --> 00:20:39,098
enter and, you know,
he'd win automatically?

218
00:20:49,544 --> 00:20:51,603
How you feelin', pal?

219
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,478
I'm okay.

220
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:56,881
The police are lookin'
for you, though.

221
00:20:58,653 --> 00:21:00,917
How come?

222
00:21:00,989 --> 00:21:03,617
Uh, you know.

223
00:21:03,692 --> 00:21:07,788
You do folks a favor,
wire their joint for free cable...

224
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,225
Don't worry about it.

225
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:14,700
You gonna be okay
by yourself for a while?

226
00:21:16,805 --> 00:21:18,864
Where you goin'?

227
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:22,973
Somethin' I gotta do
I've been puttin' off.

228
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,678
You get some rest.

229
00:21:32,787 --> 00:21:36,587
That's it?
You've got nothing else?

230
00:21:38,994 --> 00:21:41,258
Okay, thank you.

231
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,665
Henry Weems has no police record,
I assume.

232
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:50,028
He has no record
of any kind, Mulder.

233
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,762
He doesn't earn enough
in a year to file tax returns.

234
00:21:52,836 --> 00:21:56,135
He has no savings account,
no checking account, no insurance.

235
00:21:56,206 --> 00:22:01,166
Doesn't even have a video rental
card for that matter.
Doesn't even have a driver's license.

236
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:04,112
I mean, it's like he's intentionally
stayed off the radar.

237
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:07,344
He's retired from the world.

238
00:22:07,418 --> 00:22:09,750
Ever since December 1989.

239
00:22:11,488 --> 00:22:13,956
That's when a commuter jet
crashed into Lake Michigan...

240
00:22:14,024 --> 00:22:16,117
carrying 21 passengers.

241
00:22:16,193 --> 00:22:18,423
- There was one survivor.
- Henry.

242
00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:21,589
Yeah. That's how
he lost his eye.

243
00:22:21,665 --> 00:22:24,259
Snowy night, Christmas rush.
He'd been bumped from three flights...

244
00:22:24,334 --> 00:22:27,667
before they finally found a seat
for him on that fateful plane.

245
00:22:27,738 --> 00:22:31,105
- Guess what seat number.
- Thirteen?

246
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:33,973
- Of flight seven.
- More good luck you're saying?

247
00:22:34,044 --> 00:22:36,638
Call it good or bad, but maybe
that's where it all started.

248
00:22:36,714 --> 00:22:40,275
What if a brand-new Henry Weems
was plucked from the wreckage...

249
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,581
one whose fortunes had been
irrevocably permanently changed?

250
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:48,489
Before 1989, Henry held down a job
for nine years at a train yard.

251
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,757
But after the accident, as you said,
it's like he disappeared
off the face of the earth.

252
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,958
He severed ties with all his friends
and moved out to Melrose Park.

253
00:22:56,033 --> 00:23:00,527
Mulder, there are millions of reasons
for that, including survivor's guilt.

254
00:23:00,604 --> 00:23:04,472
What doesn't track for me is why
Henry Weems would drop off the map...

255
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:06,839
just because he suddenly
became incredibly lucky.

256
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,674
What doesn't track for me is why
he's resurfaced after all these years.

257
00:23:09,747 --> 00:23:12,648
Why he suddenly decided
to use his luck in this way.

258
00:23:17,955 --> 00:23:20,617
-  All right, take care
of yourself, brother.
- Later.

259
00:23:26,997 --> 00:23:29,158
Hey, what's the, uh,
lottery up to?

260
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:32,100
- Twenty-eight million.
- I don't need that much.

261
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:34,967
You don't need that much?
How much do you need, uh, Rockefeller?

262
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,598
More like a hundred grand.

263
00:23:41,812 --> 00:23:43,780
Here goes.
One dollar.

264
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:54,349
These suck.

265
00:23:58,962 --> 00:24:01,453
More on this morning's
Melrose Park shooting.

266
00:24:01,532 --> 00:24:03,966
Let's go live to the scene
with Megan MacLean.

267
00:24:04,034 --> 00:24:07,197
Police have confirmed that a
Melrose Park building superintendent...

268
00:24:07,271 --> 00:24:09,967
is wanted for questioning
in a case some sources term...

269
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,804
an unusually vicious
gangland slaying.

270
00:24:12,876 --> 00:24:16,835
You did it!
You won a hundred grand!

271
00:24:18,382 --> 00:24:23,012
- Where do I collect the money?
- Man, they'll mail it to ya.

272
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,817
Eighty-two hundred dollars
a month for twelve months. Yeah!

273
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,051
That's too long.

274
00:24:32,963 --> 00:24:34,897
No, please,
I wouldn't do that.

275
00:24:34,965 --> 00:24:38,833
Oh, baby!
Oh, sweet baby!

276
00:24:38,902 --> 00:24:42,065
Anything in the trash can
is the store's property.

277
00:24:42,139 --> 00:24:45,040
- Yeah, right. In your face!
- Please, no, just throw it away.

278
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,235
Something bad is gonna happen.

279
00:24:47,311 --> 00:24:49,905
So long, suckers.

280
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,574
I did it!
I won! I won the lottery!

281
00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:55,413
A hundred grand, fools!
A hundred grand!

282
00:25:04,094 --> 00:25:07,552
On three.
One, two, three.

283
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,532
So, let me get this straight.

284
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:15,129
- This is the man who
initially won the money?
- Mm-hmm.

285
00:25:15,205 --> 00:25:18,971
And once you and he ascertained that
the accident victim was still alive,

286
00:25:19,042 --> 00:25:21,067
this man fled on foot?

287
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,078
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

288
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:26,138
After which, the man
who was hit by the truck...

289
00:25:26,216 --> 00:25:28,844
handed you the
lottery card and said...

290
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:33,618
"Maurice, I want you
to have this."

291
00:25:34,691 --> 00:25:37,125
Mm-hmm.

292
00:25:37,194 --> 00:25:39,685
Thank you, Mr. Albert.
I think that will be all.

293
00:25:39,763 --> 00:25:42,755
Thank you.

294
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:47,361
For such a fortunate man,
a lot of unfortunate things
happen in Henry Weems' wake.

295
00:25:47,437 --> 00:25:51,601
Maybe that's part of the package.
You can't have one without the other.

296
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,977
So, Mulder, Henry Weems
came here to buy a lottery ticket.

297
00:25:56,046 --> 00:25:57,980
Why?

298
00:25:58,048 --> 00:26:02,815
Maybe it's like you said:
"Why wouldn't the luckiest man in
the world enter the lottery?"

299
00:26:06,123 --> 00:26:09,286
Actually, that's exactly
what you said...

300
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,089
about an hour
after you said it.

301
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:31,613
Well, he's not in his place
and he's not with Richie.

302
00:26:31,682 --> 00:26:33,650
You think he hid in there?

303
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:37,016
He doesn't hide.
He avoids.

304
00:26:37,087 --> 00:26:40,488
Well, pretty damn well, I'd say.

305
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,754
That thing must go
all over the building, Mulder.

306
00:26:43,827 --> 00:26:47,854
I'll start with the roof
if you wanna start with the basement.

307
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,994
Hey! Hey!

308
00:28:25,062 --> 00:28:27,587
Watch the rough stuff.

309
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:31,293
- Henry Weems, you're a hard man
to track down.
- I'm workin' here!

310
00:28:31,368 --> 00:28:34,360
Oh? You and I
are gonna have a talk.

311
00:28:34,438 --> 00:28:38,374
- You just sit right here
and don't move, okay?
- Tough guy.

312
00:28:44,081 --> 00:28:46,379
Oh, crap. Not again.

313
00:29:22,853 --> 00:29:26,846
Let's get him up to O.R.
Coming through.

314
00:29:26,923 --> 00:29:28,857
Excuse us.

315
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,763
Does it hurt?

316
00:29:40,837 --> 00:29:43,863
Stings a bit.

317
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,540
But I'll live.

318
00:29:46,673 --> 00:29:49,972
Come over here, Henry.
I wanna try something.

319
00:29:51,044 --> 00:29:54,275
- What's that about?
- I haven't a clue.

320
00:30:10,931 --> 00:30:13,365
Nine of clubs.
You go.

321
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:16,163
- What for?
- I think you know.

322
00:30:19,573 --> 00:30:21,803
Oh, you win.

323
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:24,469
Double or nothing.

324
00:30:28,415 --> 00:30:31,043
Ooo-hoo!
Tough to beat.

325
00:30:38,825 --> 00:30:41,726
- You win again!
- Mulder, what does that prove?

326
00:30:41,795 --> 00:30:44,161
I think it proves if we played
this 10,000 times in a row,

327
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,755
he would win
10,000 times in a row.

328
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:49,961
He's incapable of losing.

329
00:30:50,036 --> 00:30:53,699
How does it feel to be
the luckiest man in the universe, Henry?

330
00:30:57,677 --> 00:31:01,511
It's a nightmare.
You have no idea.

331
00:31:01,581 --> 00:31:03,674
No, I do.

332
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:07,880
'Cause when you get lucky...
really, really lucky...

333
00:31:07,954 --> 00:31:11,481
people around you
tend to suffer, is that right?

334
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:14,425
I think it's a balance thing.

335
00:31:14,494 --> 00:31:16,428
Something good happens to me,

336
00:31:16,496 --> 00:31:18,930
then everybody else has to
take it in the keister.

337
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:21,593
So you stayed close to home mostly,
kept a low profile.

338
00:31:21,668 --> 00:31:25,900
But recently you've been venturing out
further. You played poker with mobsters.

339
00:31:25,972 --> 00:31:28,600
I figured they could
stand the trimming.

340
00:31:28,675 --> 00:31:32,202
Bunch of goombah jerks.
They got issues, man.

341
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:35,406
You don't mind so much
if a few criminals get hurt,

342
00:31:35,482 --> 00:31:38,280
but then you went
and you played the lottery.

343
00:31:38,351 --> 00:31:40,979
- I don't...
- I knew I shouldn't have done that.

344
00:31:41,054 --> 00:31:43,818
- I needed the money.
- For what?

345
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:48,656
For Richie, right?

346
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,967
It's the complications
from his hepatitis.

347
00:32:04,044 --> 00:32:06,740
He's on every donor list
they got, but...

348
00:32:06,813 --> 00:32:11,113
he's got a rare blood type...
"B" negative.

349
00:32:11,184 --> 00:32:14,585
And he's... C.N. something.

350
00:32:14,654 --> 00:32:17,316
C.M.V. negative...
Cytomegalovirus.

351
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:20,018
There's no way they're
gonna find a donor in time.

352
00:32:23,596 --> 00:32:25,530
There's a treatment program
in England.

353
00:32:25,598 --> 00:32:27,532
Hundred grand gets him in.

354
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,866
It's experimental, but...
it's the best chance he's got now.

355
00:32:35,775 --> 00:32:38,710
- Am I under arrest?
- No.

356
00:32:38,778 --> 00:32:42,612
However, you will need protection
from Catrona and his men.

357
00:32:49,756 --> 00:32:52,953
I'd say they need
protection from me.

358
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,563
I'm sorry, Mulder.
That was utterly irresponsible.

359
00:32:59,632 --> 00:33:05,036
You're feeding the delusions
of a man who had three attempts
made upon his life.

360
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:08,734
You're supposed to be talking him
into protective custody, not out of it.

361
00:33:08,808 --> 00:33:11,641
I'd agree with you if I thought
his life was in danger.

362
00:33:14,581 --> 00:33:19,075
As it is, he's doing a betterjob on
Catrona's organization than the F.B.I.

363
00:33:19,152 --> 00:33:21,882
I'm wondering if we shouldn't
make him an honorary agent.

364
00:33:21,955 --> 00:33:24,788
Mulder, you're putting
an astounding amount of faith...

365
00:33:24,858 --> 00:33:27,418
in coincidence and luck.

366
00:33:27,494 --> 00:33:29,894
Essentially, you're betting
a man's life on it.

367
00:33:29,963 --> 00:33:33,228
And even if you believe
in so-called lucky streaks,

368
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:36,200
you have to know
they all eventually end.

369
00:33:45,311 --> 00:33:48,542
Luckiest man in the world?

370
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:52,714
Well, Mulder,
I just beat him.

371
00:33:56,823 --> 00:33:58,757
- Mulder?
- Come on, Scully.

372
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,191
Henry!

373
00:34:38,198 --> 00:34:42,259
- You're supposed to be resting.
- I am resting.

374
00:34:42,335 --> 00:34:45,031
Playing on the floor
doesn't count.

375
00:34:47,974 --> 00:34:50,636
Don't you ever get tired
of this thing?

376
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,644
Henry said it's educational.

377
00:34:52,712 --> 00:34:57,581
Yeah, well, I don't want you believing
everything that Henry says.

378
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,141
Did you know the police
are looking for him?

379
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,678
- Henry said it's no big deal.
- When did you see...

380
00:35:03,756 --> 00:35:06,122
Mom, what's wrong?

381
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:19,700
How's he doin'?

382
00:35:19,772 --> 00:35:22,400
He's got a bruised rib
and a black eye.

383
00:35:22,475 --> 00:35:26,377
It certainly could have been worse.
And don't tell me he just got lucky.

384
00:35:26,446 --> 00:35:28,380
Far from it.

385
00:35:28,448 --> 00:35:31,747
Maybe what you said
about streaks is right.

386
00:35:31,818 --> 00:35:34,184
Looks like his has
just about run its course.

387
00:35:34,254 --> 00:35:36,586
I don't mean to make light
of his misfortune,

388
00:35:36,656 --> 00:35:39,250
but it may have knocked
some sense into his head.

389
00:35:39,325 --> 00:35:42,317
He's agreed to testify
against Catrona.

390
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:48,865
- What?
- Our guy from theJustice
Department just called.

391
00:35:48,935 --> 00:35:51,062
They're filing a federal warrant
this afternoon.

392
00:35:51,137 --> 00:35:54,937
- This mook Weems...
- This mook Weems was street pizza
last I heard from you.

393
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,738
He was.
I don't know what it is.

394
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,643
Maybe he has some special ability.

395
00:36:00,713 --> 00:36:02,806
He's impervious or something.

396
00:36:04,717 --> 00:36:08,312
Anyway, we can't get to him.
They got cops all over the hospital.

397
00:36:08,388 --> 00:36:11,221
Who says we have to get to him?

398
00:36:12,592 --> 00:36:15,152
I want the toy
Henry made me, Mom.

399
00:36:15,228 --> 00:36:17,492
Can you please go get it?

400
00:36:17,563 --> 00:36:19,497
Uh, sure, honey.

401
00:36:19,565 --> 00:36:23,831
- We gotta go.
- Richie, I will bring it
and I will follow you there.

402
00:36:23,903 --> 00:36:26,872
I will meet you
at the hospital, okay?

403
00:37:27,133 --> 00:37:29,795
- Did you find her?
- No.

404
00:37:29,869 --> 00:37:33,327
You know Catrona took her.
He did it to keep me from testifying.

405
00:37:33,406 --> 00:37:37,172
And he's who we're focused on.
But there's no sign of
a kidnapping, no ransom note.

406
00:37:37,243 --> 00:37:40,974
- He's too smart for that.
- It makes it very hard for us
to obtain a search warrant.

407
00:37:41,047 --> 00:37:43,413
- We'll get one, though.
- When?

408
00:37:43,483 --> 00:37:46,885
Tomorrow? Next week?

409
00:37:47,018 --> 00:37:49,486
Could someone sit
with him at least?

410
00:37:49,554 --> 00:37:52,682
Hold up, Henry. What if
what I said before wasn't true?

411
00:37:52,757 --> 00:37:57,717
That your luck hasn't changed? Maybe
all this is happening for a reason.

412
00:37:57,795 --> 00:38:01,822
So you're saying that Maggie
getting taken is a good thing?

413
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,768
No, I'm saying that what looks like it
might be bad luck may not be bad luck.

414
00:38:05,837 --> 00:38:08,271
That we can't tell yet.
We're not in that position.

415
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,739
We can't see the forest
for the trees.

416
00:38:22,086 --> 00:38:24,884
How is he?

417
00:38:24,956 --> 00:38:29,552
Not good. If we don't find a donor
in the next few hours...

418
00:38:32,597 --> 00:38:35,896
Scully, what if everybody that becomes
involved in Henry Weems' life...

419
00:38:35,967 --> 00:38:39,368
somehow becomes an integral part
of his luck, including you and I?

420
00:38:40,638 --> 00:38:43,106
Mulder, you're speaking
as if we're all trapped...

421
00:38:43,174 --> 00:38:45,233
in one of those contraptions
that he built.

422
00:38:48,112 --> 00:38:50,945
- What are you doing?
- Looking for Maggie Lupone.

423
00:38:57,422 --> 00:39:00,585
Luck is the overreaching force
in this investigation.

424
00:39:00,658 --> 00:39:02,853
I say we roll with it.

425
00:39:08,399 --> 00:39:11,493
- Yeah. Let's call that a dry run.
- Yeah.

426
00:39:27,518 --> 00:39:29,782
Look who came calling.

427
00:39:33,891 --> 00:39:37,486
I wanted to tell you personally
that there's no hard feelings.

428
00:39:37,562 --> 00:39:39,996
I'm not testifying
against you.

429
00:39:41,165 --> 00:39:44,134
Just let Maggie Lupone go.

430
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,129
Maggie?

431
00:39:48,206 --> 00:39:50,367
I don't know anybody named Maggie.

432
00:39:51,409 --> 00:39:53,673
You know anybody named Maggie?

433
00:39:55,747 --> 00:39:57,681
Fellas, don't jerk me around.

434
00:39:57,749 --> 00:40:00,479
Jerk you around?

435
00:40:00,551 --> 00:40:03,247
You tried to cheat me
out of a hundred large,

436
00:40:03,321 --> 00:40:06,154
you kill Angie,
you put Sal in the hospital.

437
00:40:06,224 --> 00:40:08,215
I'm jerkin' you around?

438
00:40:10,895 --> 00:40:13,693
I apologize for my choice of words.

439
00:40:13,765 --> 00:40:16,632
Please, just let her go.

440
00:40:16,701 --> 00:40:19,101
Her kid's really sick.

441
00:40:20,805 --> 00:40:22,830
I don't care what happens to me.

442
00:40:22,907 --> 00:40:24,841
You'll care.

443
00:40:26,344 --> 00:40:29,177
By the time I'm finished,

444
00:40:29,247 --> 00:40:31,977
you'll definitely care.

445
00:40:41,926 --> 00:40:43,860
Henry?

446
00:40:43,928 --> 00:40:46,920
Richie, how is he?

447
00:40:49,067 --> 00:40:50,864
Not that one.

448
00:40:50,935 --> 00:40:53,529
Use the small one.

449
00:40:53,604 --> 00:40:55,697
Hey!

450
00:40:57,642 --> 00:40:59,576
Henry?

451
00:41:18,429 --> 00:41:21,421
Don't you hurt him,
you son of a bitch!

452
00:41:21,499 --> 00:41:23,399
Shut her up!

453
00:41:37,348 --> 00:41:39,373
Henry!

454
00:42:08,045 --> 00:42:09,979
Oh!

455
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,853
Check downstairs!

456
00:42:46,918 --> 00:42:49,614
What are the odds
for Catrona being a perfect match?

457
00:42:49,687 --> 00:42:53,282
- A thousand to one? A million to one?
- Maybe higher.

458
00:42:55,259 --> 00:42:57,523
Maybe everything
does happen for a reason.

459
00:42:59,096 --> 00:43:01,792
Whether we see it or not.

460
00:43:07,638 --> 00:43:09,629
Maybe your luck is changing.

461
00:43:09,707 --> 00:43:12,471
Maybe.
