162
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:14,131
[ Frohike ]
I'LL BE DAMNED.

163
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:17,735
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME
WHAT THE DEIONIZED WATER
MIGHT BE FOR.

164
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:20,571
- WHO KNEW IT WAS A MICROCHIP
  WE WERE LOOKIN' FOR.
- THIS IS A CURE FOR CANCER ?

165
00:12:22,556 --> 00:12:25,559
- IT MAY BE FOR SCULLY'S.
- HOW ?

166
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:27,345
[ Mulder ]
SHORTLY AFTER SHE WAS ABDUCTED,

167
00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:31,716
SHE DISCOVERED A SMALL
METALLIC CHIP IMPLANTED
SUBCUTANEOUSLY IN HER NECK.

168
00:12:31,716 --> 00:12:35,503
IT WAS JUST A SHORT TIME
AFTER SHE HAD IT REMOVED
THAT SHE DEVELOPED CANCER.

169
00:12:35,503 --> 00:12:38,205
- IT'S UNREAL.
- TOO FREAKIN' AMAZING.

170
00:12:38,205 --> 00:12:41,776
WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE, FROHIKE,
AND GRAB ME SOME TWEEZERS.

171
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:05,533
[ Blevins ]
MR. KRITSCHGAU, THANK YOU
FOR BEING HERE TODAY...

172
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:07,752
AND FOR COOPERATING
WITH THIS INVESTIGATION.

173
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:10,621
WE HOPE YOU CAN
PROVIDE INFORMATION...

174
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:12,823
THAT WILL ALLOW US
TO MAKE FORMAL CHARGES...

175
00:13:12,823 --> 00:13:15,876
FOR THE MURDER OF DEFENSE
EMPLOYEE SCOTT OSTELHOFF.

176
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:17,862
MR. KRITSCHGAU,

177
00:13:17,862 --> 00:13:21,499
WE HAVE LEARNED THAT
YOU WERE IN CONTACT WITH
AGENTS MULDER AND SCULLY...

178
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:23,317
JUST PRIOR TO THIS MAN'S DEATH.

179
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:27,772
- THAT'S CORRECT.
- AND THAT YOU MAY HAVE GIVEN
  THEM CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

180
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:32,309
WHAT MOTIVATED THIS ?

181
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:36,013
MY KNOWLEDGE OF GOVERNMENT
INVOLVEMENT IN A CONSPIRACY
AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

182
00:13:40,468 --> 00:13:42,970
UH, BEFORE--

183
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,856
BEFORE WE GO INTO
ANY SPECIFICS ON THAT SUBJECT,

184
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:48,843
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
A MORE POINTED QUESTION.

185
00:13:48,843 --> 00:13:51,128
DO YOU KNOW WHO KILLED
SCOTT OSTELHOFF ?

186
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:55,015
NO, I DON'T.

187
00:13:55,015 --> 00:14:00,488
DO YOU KNOW OF ANY CONNECTION
BETWEEN HIS DEATH
AND AGENTS MULDER OR SCULLY ?

188
00:14:00,488 --> 00:14:03,641
NO.

189
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:06,026
I'M AWARE OF ONE DEATH
IN CONNECTION, THOUGH.

190
00:14:09,497 --> 00:14:11,999
MY SON,
WHO DIED EARLY THIS MORNING.

191
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,973
MR. KRITSCHGAU,

192
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:21,475
YOU'RE EMPLOYED BY
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,
IS THAT CORRECT ?

193
00:14:21,475 --> 00:14:23,344
[ Kritschgau ]
TECHNICALLY.

194
00:14:23,344 --> 00:14:27,281
PART OF MY REMUNERATION
HAS COME FROM ANOTHER SOURCE.

195
00:14:28,783 --> 00:14:32,169
A CONGRESSIONAL LOBBYING FIRM--
SOMETHING CALLED ROUSH.

196
00:14:34,722 --> 00:14:38,175
ROUSH ?
ANY IDEA WHAT THAT IS ?

197
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:39,877
NO, SIR.

198
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,936
THIS IS CRAZY, JUST CRAZY.

199
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:51,739
WELL, CRAZY IN WHAT SENSE ?
IN THAT IT MIGHT SAVE
YOUR SISTER'S LIFE ?

200
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:55,893
YOU'RE NOT A DOCTOR.
YOU HAVE NO PLACE EVEN
SUGGESTING THIS SCIENCE FICTION.

201
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:59,330
IT'S NOT SCIENCE FICTION.
HE'S NEVER HEARD OF IT !

202
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,832
BILL.
[ Sighs ]

203
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:06,320
- HAVE YOU ?
- NO, I HAVEN'T.

204
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,857
I THINK THERE'S AN OBVIOUS
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION HERE.

205
00:15:09,857 --> 00:15:12,459
[ Scully ]
I THINK...

206
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:16,096
THAT EVERYBODY HERE HAS
THEIR HEART IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

207
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,068
BUT I NEED IT
TO BE MY DECISION.

208
00:15:21,068 --> 00:15:24,288
DANA--
I KNOW YOU'RE ONLY
LOOKING OUT FOR ME, BILL,

209
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:27,424
BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU HAVE ALL THE FACTS.

210
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:32,630
DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD
LISTEN TO YOUR DOCTOR ?

211
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,050
YES.  I AM.

212
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,302
WOULD SHE HAVE TO STOP
HER CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT ?

213
00:15:38,302 --> 00:15:40,721
[ Doctor ]
TO BE HONEST,
AT THIS POINT...

214
00:15:40,721 --> 00:15:44,141
THE ONLY APPROACH I HAVE LEFT
WITH HER PARTICULAR CANCER...

215
00:15:44,141 --> 00:15:46,143
IS QUITE UNCONVENTIONAL.

216
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:54,285
I'D LIKE TO TRY THIS.

217
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,141
YOU REALLY BELIEVE
THIS CRAP, DON'T YOU ?

218
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:53,460
YES, I DO.

219
00:16:56,263 --> 00:16:58,766
YOU SEE,
SHE'S YOUR BIG DEFENDER,

220
00:16:58,766 --> 00:17:03,020
BUT I THINK THE TRUTH IS
SHE JUST DOESN'T WANT
TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

221
00:17:06,373 --> 00:17:09,209
IF IT WORKS, I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU THINK SHE THINKS.

222
00:17:10,644 --> 00:17:13,147
YOU'RE A REAL PIECE OF WORK,
YOU KNOW THAT, MR. MULDER ?

223
00:17:13,647 --> 00:17:15,532
WHY IS THAT ?
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
THE WAY YOU THINK ?

224
00:17:15,532 --> 00:17:19,853
BECAUSE I WON'T JUST SIT
PASSIVELY BACK AND WATCH
THE FAMILY TRAGEDY UNFOLD ?

225
00:17:19,853 --> 00:17:22,706
YOU'RE THE REASON FOR IT.

226
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:28,979
AND I'VE ALREADY LOST ONE SISTER
TO THIS QUEST YOU'RE ON.

227
00:17:28,979 --> 00:17:31,332
NOW I'M LOSING ANOTHER.

228
00:17:37,338 --> 00:17:39,840
HAS IT BEEN WORTH IT ?

229
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,343
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I MEAN.
HAVE YOU FOUND
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR ?

230
00:17:47,314 --> 00:17:50,584
- NO.
- NO.

231
00:17:51,085 --> 00:17:52,586
YOU KNOW HOW
THAT MAKES ME FEEL ?

232
00:17:54,088 --> 00:17:56,090
IN A WAY, I THINK I DO.

233
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,560
I LOST SOMEONE
VERY CLOSE TO ME.

234
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:03,063
I LOST A SISTER.

235
00:18:03,063 --> 00:18:05,065
I LOST MY FATHER.

236
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:09,320
ALL BECAUSE OF THIS THING
I'M LOOKING FOR.

237
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,156
THIS WHAT ?
LITTLE GREEN ALIENS ?

238
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,266
YEAH.
LITTLE GREEN ALIENS.

YOU'RE ONE SORRY

240
00:18:31,258 --> 00:18:33,543

HOW'S OUR PATIENT ?

244
00:18:53,146 --> 00:18:56,883
YOU DID FIND THE CHIP,
DIDN'T YOU, AGENT MULDER ?
YES.

245
00:18:56,883 --> 00:19:00,187
I CAN IMAGINE
THERE WAS SOME QUESTION
AS TO ITS MEDICAL VALUE.

246
00:19:00,187 --> 00:19:03,139
WELL, THERE STILL IS.

247
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:08,061

TO EARN YOUR TRUST,
IN SPITE OF MY GESTURE.

YOU COULD SAY THAT, YEAH.

249
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:13,900
WELL, I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE
TO OFFER YOU.

250
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,837
I'VE ARRANGED A MEETING
I THINK YOU'LL WANT TO ATTEND,
MR. MULDER.

IT CURES ANYTHING.

252
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:36,990
I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

I NEVER REALLY KNEW
WHAT HAPPENED.

ALL BACK TOGETHER.

262

BUT AS MUCH
AS I TRIED TO REMEMBER,

263
00:21:21,678 --> 00:21:24,180
I TRIED MORE TO FORGET.

264
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,183
WHY ?
I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD...

265
00:21:28,568 --> 00:21:31,071
AND FRIGHTENED TO DEATH.

266
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:32,856
AND THEY TOLD ME
THAT I WAS AN ORPHAN.

267
00:21:34,207 --> 00:21:37,594
BUT YOU CALL THAT MAN

268
00:21:37,594 --> 00:21:40,330

GONNA SEE MY FATHER.

BUT YOU KNEW
WHO YOUR FATHER WAS.
I THOUGHT I KNEW.

273
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:57,113
BUT HE TOLD ME THAT
IT HAD ALL BEEN A SECRET,

00:21:57,113 --> 00:21:59,399
AND THAT HE AND MOM...

275
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:01,651
HADN'T TOLD ANYONE
TO PROTECT THE FAMILY.

276
00:22:03,987 --> 00:22:06,690
AND YOU BELIEVED THAT ?
HE WAS SO KIND TO ME.

AND HE WAS THE ONLY ONE
I COULD REMEMBER
FROM BEFORE WHAT HAPPENED.

THAT HE'D FOUND YOU.

288

YOU WANTED TO SEE ME
VERY BADLY--

FOR ME FOR A LONG TIME.

290

IS THAT TRUE ?

HOW TO FIND YOU.

I WANT YOU
TO LISTEN TO ME, OKAY ?

WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TOLD
BY THAT MAN...

295
00:23:33,877 --> 00:23:36,029
MAY NOT BE TRUE.

296
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:39,532
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT ?
BECAUSE THE MAN
THAT BROUGHT YOU HERE...

297
00:23:40,033 --> 00:23:41,901
HAS KNOWN WHERE I'VE BEEN
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

298
00:23:41,901 --> 00:23:44,354
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

299
00:23:44,354 --> 00:23:46,239
WHY WOULDN'T HE TELL ME ?

300
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:48,224
I DON'T KNOW.

301
00:23:48,725 --> 00:23:50,527
BUT I THINK HE'S KEPT
A LOT OF THINGS FROM YOU.

302
00:23:51,928 --> 00:23:56,683
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
HE'S BEEN A GOOD FATHER TO ME.

303
00:23:56,683 --> 00:24:00,386
HE'S GIVEN ME A LIFE,
AND HE CARED FOR ME
WHEN THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE.

304

TO COME WITH ME--
COME WITH ME TO SEE MOM.

00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:10,780
- MOM IS ALIVE ?
- YES.

306
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:15,668
AND I KNOW SHE'D LIKE
TO SEE YOU VERY, VERY MUCH.

307
00:24:21,591 --> 00:24:24,494
- I CAN'T.
- WHY NOT ?

308
00:24:24,494 --> 00:24:28,698
THIS IS TOO MUCH.
I DIDN'T WANNA
COME HERE AT ALL, FOX.

JUST-JUST TELL ME
WHERE I CAN FIND YOU.

PLEASE DON'T, FOX !

WE WILL DO THIS
ON YOUR TIME.  JUST--

315
00:24:48,101 --> 00:24:51,704
THEN PLEASE--
PLEASE LET ME GO.

00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:15,437
IF I CAN JUMP-START
YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM,

325
00:26:15,937 --> 00:26:18,957
IF I CAN GET YOUR CYTOLYTIC
CELLS TO RECOGNIZE YOUR TUMOR...

326
00:26:19,457 --> 00:26:22,878
AS SOMETHING TO ATTACK,
THEN THERE'S A CHANCE.

327
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,550
HAVE YOU EVER WITNESSED
A MIRACLE, DR. ZUCKERMAN ?

328
00:26:29,885 --> 00:26:33,088
I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE.

329
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,390
BUT I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE
MAKE RECOVERIES--

330
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,493
COME BACK FROM SO FAR GONE,
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.

331
00:26:39,995 --> 00:26:41,997
ISN'T THAT A MIRACLE ?

332
00:26:44,499 --> 00:26:47,002
MAYBE THEY ARE MIRACLES,

333
00:26:47,002 --> 00:26:49,287
BUT I DON'T DARE
CALL THEM THAT.

334
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:53,441
THANK YOU.

335
00:27:24,906 --> 00:27:27,409
MY APOLOGIES FOR THE...

336
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:30,412
RATHER HASTY DEPARTURE
LAST NIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME ?

338
00:27:33,415 --> 00:27:36,918
YOU GIVE ME THESE THINGS,
THE ONLY THINGS
I EVER WANTED,

339
00:27:36,918 --> 00:27:39,921
AND I CAN'T THINK
OF ANY REASON
FOR YOU TO DO SO.

340
00:27:39,921 --> 00:27:42,924
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.
NO ACT IS COMPLETELY SELFLESS.

341
00:27:44,426 --> 00:27:46,428
BUT I'VE COME TODAY NOT TO--

342
00:27:46,428 --> 00:27:49,431
NOT TO ASK BUT TO OFFER.

343
00:27:49,431 --> 00:27:52,934
OFFER YOU THE TRUTH THAT
YOU'VE SO DESPERATELY SOUGHT--

344
00:27:53,435 --> 00:27:57,188
ABOUT THE PROJECT,
ABOUT THE MEN
WHO'VE CONSPIRED TO PROTECT IT.

345
00:27:57,188 --> 00:28:01,142
I KNOW THE TRUTH.
DO YOU ?

346
00:28:01,142 --> 00:28:03,962
I SPOKE TO ONE OF YOUR MEN.
AND YOU KNOW
HE'S NOT A LIAR ?

347
00:28:03,962 --> 00:28:05,964
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH TO KNOW
HE'S NOT A LIAR, YEAH.

348
00:28:05,964 --> 00:28:08,750
YOU'VE SEEN BUT SCANT PIECES
OF THE WHOLE.

349
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,302

CAN YOU SHOW ME ?

TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

IS SHE CURED ?

ONLY TO TAKE HER RIGHT BACK ?
YOU'VE GIVEN ME NOTHING.

 I JUST NEED SOMETHING FROM YOU.

365
00:29:08,727 --> 00:29:12,297

 YOU KILLED SCULLY'S SISTER.

366
00:29:12,297 --> 00:29:14,632
AND IF SCULLY DIES,
I WILL KILL YOU.

367

WHOSE FATHER YOU ARE.

368

A HEARING TOMORROW,

380
00:30:14,242 --> 00:30:16,744
BUT I'VE BEEN SO STUPID.

381

WHAT ?  WHAT IS IT ?

382
00:30:23,785 --> 00:30:26,788
I'VE COME SO FAR IN MY LIFE
ON SIMPLE FAITH.

383
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:31,126
AND NOW WHEN I NEED IT THE MOST,
I JUST PUSH IT AWAY.

384
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:36,064
I MEAN, WHY--

385
00:30:36,064 --> 00:30:37,849
WHY DO I WEAR THIS ?

386
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:39,868
WHY DO I WEAR THIS, MOM ?

387
00:30:41,553 --> 00:30:44,489

THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW...

388
00:30:44,989 --> 00:30:46,991
OR UNDERSTAND
UNDER THE SKIN OF MY NECK.

389
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:49,494
I WILL SUBJECT MYSELF
TO THESE CRAZY TREATMENTS,

390
00:30:49,994 --> 00:30:54,782
AND I KEEP TELLING MYSELF
THAT I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN,
BUT IT'S A LIE.

391
00:30:54,782 --> 00:30:58,353
YOU HAVE NOT LOST
YOUR FAITH, DANA.

392
00:30:59,654 --> 00:31:02,157
BUT I HAVE... IN A WAY.

393
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,662
WHEN YOU ASKED--
WHEN YOU ASKED FATHER McCUE
TO DINNER...

394
00:31:07,662 --> 00:31:09,664
TO MINISTER TO MY FAITH,

395
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:13,501
I JUST CLOSED OFF TO HIM.

396
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:17,922
WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW...

397
00:31:19,424 --> 00:31:21,426
IS THAT
YOU SAVE YOUR ENERGY.

398
00:31:25,313 --> 00:31:27,148
I'M NOT GETTING BETTER, MOM.

399
00:31:27,148 --> 00:31:29,834
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT YET.

400
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:32,554
THE PET SCAN
SHOWED NO IMPROVEMENT.

401
00:31:44,866 --> 00:31:47,769
I KNOW YOU'RE AFRAID.

402
00:31:51,172 --> 00:31:52,924
I KNOW YOU'RE AFRAID
TO TELL ME,

403
00:31:52,924 --> 00:31:55,009
BUT YOU HAVE TO
TELL SOMEONE.

404
00:31:59,747 --> 00:32:02,200
I'LL MAKE A STATEMENT
RIGHT HERE.

405
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,169
CLONING WILL CONTINUE.

406
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:08,172
THE HUMAN MIND WILL CONTINUE
TO INQUIRE INTO THIS.

407
00:32:09,674 --> 00:32:13,678
HUMAN CLONING WILL TAKE PLACE,
AND IT'LL TAKE PLACE
IN MY LIFETIME.

408
00:32:13,678 --> 00:32:16,931
I THINK IT'S RIGHT AND PROPER
THAT WE CONTINUE
THIS KIND OF INQUIRY.

409
00:32:16,931 --> 00:32:20,985
I THINK IT HOLDS UNTOLD BENEFITS
FOR HUMAN KIND.

TURN ON YOUR TELEVISION.
ARE YOU WATCHING THE HEARINGS ?

411

DO YOU SEE WHO'S THERE ?

412
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:30,545
HE'S GATHERING INFORMATION
FOR WHO ?

413
00:32:34,282 --> 00:32:38,086
OUR COLLEAGUE WAS SUPPOSED TO
HAVE FIXED THE F.B.I. PROBLEM.

YOU WILL FIX IT NOW.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME ?

415
00:32:44,225 --> 00:32:46,060

[ Blevins ]
AGENT MULDER,
WILL YOU PLEASE TAKE A SEAT ?

417

SOMETHING URGENTLY IMPORTANT
HAS COME TO THE FORE.

418
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:17,935
AS YOU'RE SET TO TESTIFY
ON YOUR OWN BEHALF LATER TODAY,

419
00:34:17,935 --> 00:34:20,888
I'VE RECEIVED
ALARMING FORENSIC EVIDENCE...

00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:24,392
FROM THE MAN'S BODY
FOUND IN YOUR APARTMENT.

421
00:34:24,392 --> 00:34:27,228
I HAVE HERE IN MY HAND
BALLISTIC DATA...

MATCHING YOUR SERVICE WEAPON,
AGENT MULDER.

423

WHERE DID YOU GET THAT ?
I'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO SAY.

424
00:34:33,734 --> 00:34:37,705
BUT UNLESS YOU CAN OFFER UP
SOMEONE ELSE WHO MIGHT HAVE
FIRED THE KILL SHOT,

425
00:34:37,705 --> 00:34:39,991
EVERYTHING POINTS TO YOU
AS THIS MAN'S MURDERER.

TO GIVE TESTIMONY...

WHO FIRED THE SHOT ?

THE MAN AT THE F.B.I...

WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THIS PLOT
AGAINST YOU AND HER.

434
00:35:04,482 --> 00:35:08,402

WHOM WE HAVE LEARNED HAS BEEN
WORKING INSIDE THE F.B.I.
WITH A SECRET AGENDA.

436
00:35:13,074 --> 00:35:15,676
I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT.

EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM.

WE CAN FILE CHARGES
AGAINST HIM,

441
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:34,145

EXONERATE YOU.

TO WAKE YOU.

FIRST CONVENED TO ADDRESS
YOUR REPORTED DEATH,

491
00:39:13,097 --> 00:39:16,667
ONLY TO FIND SHORTLY THAT
THIS REPORT HAD BEEN A LIE--

492
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:19,670
THAT YOU WERE INDEED
VERY MUCH ALIVE...

493
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:22,473
AND THAT THE BODY FOUND
IN YOUR APARTMENT,
BELIEVED TO BE YOURS,

494
00:39:22,473 --> 00:39:24,825
WAS A MURDER VICTIM
KILLED WITH A WEAPON...

495
00:39:25,326 --> 00:39:28,329
ISSUED BY THE F.B.I.
AND REGISTERED TO YOU.

496
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:31,332
RESPECTFULLY, SIR,
I'VE COME HERE TODAY
TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT...

497
00:39:31,332 --> 00:39:33,334
SO THAT THIS PROCESS
YOU'VE BEGUN CAN BE COMPLETED,

498
00:39:33,334 --> 00:39:35,202
AND THE GUILTY PARTIES
CAN BE NAMED.

499
00:39:35,202 --> 00:39:37,538
RESPECTFULLY, SIR,
I'D LIKE TO ASK
FOR A SHORT BREAK.

500
00:39:37,538 --> 00:39:40,307
I'M... READY TO PROCEED,
PLEASE, SIR.

501
00:39:45,596 --> 00:39:47,598
GO ON, AGENT MULDER.

502
00:39:47,598 --> 00:39:52,520
FOUR YEARS AGO,
WHILE WORKING ON AN ASSIGNMENT
OUTSIDE THE F.B.I. MAINSTREAM,

503
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,522
I WAS PAIRED WITH
SPECIAL AGENT DANA SCULLY,

504
00:39:55,022 --> 00:39:57,024
WHO I BELIEVED WAS SENT
TO SPY ON ME--

505
00:39:57,024 --> 00:40:00,327
TO DEBUNK MY INVESTIGATIONS
INTO THE PARANORMAL.

506
00:40:00,327 --> 00:40:03,197
THAT AGENT SCULLY DID NOT
FOLLOW THESE ORDERS...

507
00:40:03,197 --> 00:40:06,200
IS A TESTAMENT TO HER INTEGRITY
AS AN INVESTIGATOR,

508
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,085
A SCIENTIST
AND A HUMAN BEING.

509
00:40:08,085 --> 00:40:12,039
SHE HAS PAID DEARLY
FOR THIS INTEGRITY.
[ Blevins ]  AGENT MULDER,

510
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:15,910
AGENT SCULLY LIED
STRAIGHT-FACED TO THIS PANEL
ABOUT YOUR DEATH.

511
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:18,145
SHE LIED BECAUSE
I ASKED HER TO.

512
00:40:18,145 --> 00:40:20,364
BECAUSE I HAD EVIDENCE
OF A CONSPIRACY--

513
00:40:20,364 --> 00:40:22,967
A CONSPIRACY AGAINST
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

514
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:26,470
WE'VE ALREADY HEARD TESTIMONY
TO THESE ALLEGATIONS,
AGENT MULDER.

515
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:28,739
AND A CONSPIRACY INTENDED
TO DESTROY THE LIVES...

516
00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:30,541
OF THOSE WHO WOULD REVEAL
ITS TRUE PURPOSE;

517
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:34,445
TO CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS
ON UNWITTING VICTIMS...

518
00:40:34,445 --> 00:40:37,965
TO FURTHER A SECRET AGENDA FOR
SOMEONE WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT
OPERATING AT LEVELS...

519
00:40:37,965 --> 00:40:41,452
WITHOUT RESTRAINT
OR RESPONSIBILITY,

520
00:40:41,452 --> 00:40:44,288
WITHOUT MORALS OR CONSCIOUS.

521
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,525

AS THEY DECEIVE.
THE PRICE OF THIS BETRAYAL--

FORENSICS FOUND IT
AT THE SCENE.

548
00:43:21,696 --> 00:43:24,248
WE'RE ASSUMING
IT'S HIS BLOOD.

549
00:43:24,248 --> 00:43:27,034
ASSUMING ?
WELL, NO BODY WAS FOUND,

550
00:43:27,034 --> 00:43:30,037
THOUGH THERE WAS
TOO MUCH BLOOD LOST
FOR ANYONE TO HAVE SURVIVED.

551
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:37,328
THIS AFTERNOON
WHEN YOU NAMED BLEVINS,

552
00:43:37,328 --> 00:43:39,597
HOW DID YOU KNOW ?

553
00:43:39,597 --> 00:43:41,599
I DIDN'T.
 I JUST GUESSED.

554
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,818
WELL, IT WAS A HELL
OF A GUESS.

555
00:43:43,818 --> 00:43:45,853
BLEVINS HAD BEEN ON PAYROLL
FOR FOUR YEARS...

TO A BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY
CALLED ROUSH,

WHICH IS SOMEHOW CONNECTED
TO ALL THIS.

558

WELL, I'M SURE
WHATEVER CONNECTIONS THERE WERE,
THEY'RE BEING ERASED RIGHT NOW.

559
00:43:55,046 --> 00:43:57,648
THEY'RE CLEANING UP,
TAKING EVERYTHING AWAY.

560
00:44:00,601 --> 00:44:03,588
NOT EVERYTHING.

561
00:44:05,873 --> 00:44:07,675
SCULLY'S CANCER'S
GONE INTO REMISSION.

562
00:44:11,095 --> 00:44:13,231
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE NEWS.

563
00:44:15,233 --> 00:44:16,984
IT'S THE BEST NEWS
I COULD HAVE EVER HEARD.

564
00:44:16,984 --> 00:44:19,720
WHAT TURNED IT AROUND ?

565
00:44:20,221 --> 00:44:23,057
I DON'T KNOW.

- CAN I SEE HER ?
- YEAH.  SHE'S IN THERE
