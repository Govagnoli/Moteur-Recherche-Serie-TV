1
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:06,231
God's love will set us free.

2
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,271
And I believe...

3
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,944
if I pray for that love,

4
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,853
if I get down on my knees...

5
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:34,128
and allow God to enter my hardened,
lonely, miserable heart...

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,931
and change me
through and through,

7
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:41,633
that miracle... will come.

8
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,974
Now, who here
believes that with me?

9
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,348
Do you?

10
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,650
- Do you?
- Yes, sir, I believe it.

11
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,796
Do you?

12
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:12,535
Well, believe, because God's
love is not just some slogan.

13
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,374
It's a promise...

14
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:22,438
straight to you from
the Lord Almighty himself.

15
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:27,145
A promise paid for with the
blood of His only begotten Son,

16
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,087
Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

17
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:34,953
All you have to do
is believe.

18
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:39,124
-  Amen!
- God's love will set you free.

19
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,497
Now doesn't that
just lift up your heart...

20
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:44,901
and make you want to say,
"Glory! Amen!"

21
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,996
Glory! Amen!

22
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:50,065
Join with me.
Allow the spirit ofJesus Christ...

23
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:53,078
to show you the way
up to our Heavenly Father.

24
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:56,547
- Glory! Amen!
- Glory! Amen!

25
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,244
Let God's love
free you from your prison...

26
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,549
and deliver you
to His side in heaven.

27
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:05,455
- Glory! Amen!
- Glory! Amen!

28
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:09,052
Praise His name.
Praise His holy love.

29
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:13,088
- Glory! Amen!
- Glory! Amen!

30
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,897
- Glory! Amen!
- Glory! Amen!

31
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,269
- Glory! Amen!
- Glory! Amen!

32
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,399
Glory! Amen!

33
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,773
Glory! Amen!

34
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,869
Glory! Amen!

35
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,971
Glory! Amen!

36
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,982
Glory! Amen!

37
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,109
Glory! Amen!

38
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:51,129
Do you believe that, Donny?
That God loves a sack of crap like you?

39
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:55,106
- The Bible says.
- The Bible says you kill women,
cut their pinkies,

40
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,405
you get to burn in hell.

41
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,378
- Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen.
- You listening to me?

42
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:04,507
God's got a place for you,
all right, you sick puke.

43
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,916
Then where's that
leave you?

44
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:10,922
Sorry. It's not good enough
for the Illinois penal system.

45
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,485
My hands! My hands!

46
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,150
Life without chance of parole...

47
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:57,279
for the premeditated
and sadistic sexual murders...

48
00:05:57,355 --> 00:06:00,381
of five Twin Cities women
in 1994.

49
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,653
Donald Addy Faster.

50
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:06,855
You two put this man away.

51
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:09,661
Yeah. Someone forgot
to throw away the key.

52
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:11,668
That's another story.

53
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:14,432
Right now we have
to apprehend this man.

54
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:17,441
We'd use all the help you can
give us in understanding exactly
who it is we're after.

55
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:19,807
Donny Faster
is a death fetishist...

56
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:22,676
a collector of bone
and dead flesh, of toenails and hair.

57
00:06:22,747 --> 00:06:25,181
It's what floats his boat,
gets him off.

58
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,980
- He's a sick man.
- Sick would describe him.

59
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:31,146
We found women's fingers
in his freezer. He liked to eat them
with his peas and carrots.

60
00:06:31,222 --> 00:06:33,884
- So it's just women he's after.
- Just women.

61
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:38,793
Been five years in here thinkin'
about only that. I'm sure he's
worked up quite an appetite.

62
00:06:38,863 --> 00:06:41,764
I happen to know you two agents
have a particular forte,

63
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,734
a thing for... what is it called...
the supernatural?

64
00:06:46,604 --> 00:06:48,731
Now, the circumstances
of the escape...

65
00:06:48,806 --> 00:06:52,742
I promise you there is nothing
supernatural about this man.

66
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,244
Donny Faster is just plain evil.

67
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,071
Case closed.

68
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:35,680
You didn't look
at the file, did you?

69
00:07:35,753 --> 00:07:38,244
A man escaped from prison.

70
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:42,384
Not a man.
Donny Faster.

71
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,724
He didn't just escape.
He walked out.

72
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:48,892
He walked out of
a maximum security facility
and no one seems to know how he did it.

73
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:51,697
- Isn't that why we're here?
- That's why I'm here.

74
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:57,069
I don't know about you.
Why are you here?

75
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:02,973
- Go home, Scully.
- Mulder, this case doesn't bother me.

76
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:05,607
The man abducted you.

77
00:08:05,683 --> 00:08:08,208
Donny Faster did a number on your head
like I've never seen.

78
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:10,811
And it's okay to...
walk away.

79
00:08:10,888 --> 00:08:16,258
Mulder, that man does things
to people that no one should
ever have to think about.

80
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:19,490
It's not a question of if I should stay.
I don't have a choice.

81
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,591
So let's get to work.

82
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,298
Well, this isn't
the first incident.

83
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:31,501
Two prisoners have escaped
from maximum security facilities...

84
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:34,170
in neighboring states
over the past year.

85
00:08:34,245 --> 00:08:38,306
At 6:06 this morning,
Donny Faster made it three.

86
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:40,317
6:06?

87
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:44,554
And what's so supernatural
about that?

88
00:08:44,622 --> 00:08:48,922
Dozens of witnesses, guards and staff
and no one seems to remember anything.

89
00:08:48,993 --> 00:08:51,587
For a while they didn't even know
these guys were missing.

90
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:55,497
- Have they been apprehended?
- Neither of the men
have ever been seen again.

91
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:07,174
I'm a Christian, man.

92
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:09,475
Then I know you'll
tell me the truth.

93
00:09:09,547 --> 00:09:14,314
Yeah. But I got no idea
about Donny Faster...

94
00:09:14,385 --> 00:09:16,683
or how he broke out.

95
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:21,555
You and Donny Faster
were in the garment shop
at or about the time he disappeared.

96
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:24,220
Well, it wasn't just me.
There was a lot of us in the shop.

97
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:27,458
Yeah, but you had something happen.
You had an incident.

98
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:30,695
Yeah, something like that.

99
00:09:30,768 --> 00:09:34,397
You cried out to the guards
that you'd cut your hands.

100
00:09:34,472 --> 00:09:38,909
My fingers, man.
I saw them all cut off.

101
00:09:38,976 --> 00:09:41,672
- Others saw them too.
- No, but I felt them cut off.

102
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:44,374
How do you explain that?

103
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:46,917
God works in mysterious ways,
brother.

104
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:53,212
- Glory. Amen.

105
00:09:57,128 --> 00:10:00,894
Glory. Amen.

106
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:04,160
Glory.

107
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:06,169
Amen.

108
00:10:09,907 --> 00:10:13,900
Posthypnotic suggestion.
Did you see him?

109
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:17,141
You mean did I see him raise his foot?
Yes, I saw that.

110
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,184
Programmed behavior prompted
and manifested by suggestion.

111
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:22,515
In this case, a rhythmic motion
of the hands...

112
00:10:22,587 --> 00:10:25,283
producing an unconscious act
in a conscious state.

113
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:27,415
It doesn't work on you.

114
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:30,757
- I know what hypnosis is, Mulder.
- Group hypnosis.

115
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:33,797
If you're suggesting that Donny Faster
escaped from prison...

116
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:37,961
using a technique from
a Vegas lounge act, I'd think again.

117
00:10:38,035 --> 00:10:41,061
Messmer was able to hypnotize
and command entire audiences.

118
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:43,937
So, how would Donny have
acquired this amazing ability?

119
00:10:44,008 --> 00:10:47,307
- I'm not saying that it was Donny.
- Well, then who?

120
00:10:47,378 --> 00:10:49,642
Three inmates are missing
from three separate prisons.

121
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:52,205
One man has had possible contact
with each of those cons.

122
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:55,878
The prison chaplain.
Glory. Amen.

123
00:10:55,953 --> 00:10:59,389
- Not God. The chaplain.

124
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,491
Scully, what?

125
00:11:03,561 --> 00:11:05,791
That song,
can you hear that?

126
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:19,943
Barely.

127
00:11:23,815 --> 00:11:28,775
I haven't heard that song since
high school. That's the second
time I've heard it in the hour.

128
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:32,949
Well, I think if it was a make-out song,
I think it'd be ruined forever now, huh?

129
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:37,120
Oh, girl, don't look any further

130
00:12:20,571 --> 00:12:23,904
Looking for something to eat?

131
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:26,341
Me?

132
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,243
How 'bout... today's special?

133
00:12:35,887 --> 00:12:38,321
- You aren't a narc, are you?
- No.

134
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:41,984
- You're looking at my hands.
- You need a buff and polish.

135
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:45,819
What are you,
a freak?

136
00:12:47,698 --> 00:12:49,757
I-I just got out of prison.

137
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,334
Hey, missy,
leave the customers alone!

138
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:53,529
Hey, missy,
leave the customers alone!

139
00:12:54,603 --> 00:12:56,537
I'll do it for free.

140
00:12:56,605 --> 00:13:00,097
You just got out of prison
and you wanna give me a manicure?

141
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:02,906
I'll even do your cuticles.

142
00:13:02,978 --> 00:13:07,472
You receive the
Lord's grace, and this is your thanks.

143
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,418
- What?
- Who do you think got you out of prison?

144
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:18,592
I don't care.
I'm busy right now.

145
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:21,425
The grace of God
got you out.

146
00:13:21,497 --> 00:13:24,728
And it's the only thing
that will keep you out.

147
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,861
- I thought you were kidding.
- He's chosen you, Donny.

148
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:38,070
Later.

149
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,750
- You called them on me.
- No.

150
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:45,787
Then do something.

151
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,323
I have a car.

152
00:13:52,428 --> 00:13:56,762
- We aren't going to make it to the car.
- It's within his power.

153
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:05,506
Glory. Amen.

154
00:14:05,574 --> 00:14:09,169
- Glory. Amen.

155
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:15,534
- Is he here?
- Well, uh...

156
00:15:15,611 --> 00:15:18,045
We're trying
to determine that.

157
00:15:18,113 --> 00:15:20,843
Did you see him?

158
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:25,285
Well, that's a good question.
We thought we saw something,
but apparently we didn't.

159
00:15:25,354 --> 00:15:28,016
We got a call about
a possible sighting of the suspect.

160
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:34,054
- Something happened here, huh?
-  Guy got hit by a car.

161
00:15:37,032 --> 00:15:39,364
Prison chaplain,
it turns out.

162
00:15:39,435 --> 00:15:41,903
- A Reverend Orison.

163
00:15:41,971 --> 00:15:44,963
Paramedics took him to the hospital.
He's in pretty bad shape.

164
00:15:50,312 --> 00:15:53,213
Excuse me. Could you
turn that up, please?

165
00:15:53,282 --> 00:15:55,580
- Yeah.
- What you need is a lover

166
00:15:55,651 --> 00:15:57,778
Someone to take over

167
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:03,824
Oh, girl
Don't look any further

168
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:05,827
And it's strange

169
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:09,058
When you think
of the chances

170
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,261
You're lucky to be alive,
Rev. Orison.

171
00:16:18,807 --> 00:16:22,140
- Who are you?
- Special Agent Dana Scully.

172
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,478
Believe in the Lord, Agent Scully.
He believes in you.

173
00:16:28,551 --> 00:16:31,782
That's nice. But my partner and I
are more concerned...

174
00:16:31,854 --> 00:16:36,484
with several disappearances
from maximum security facilities
that seem to involve you.

175
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,256
Don't be concerned.
God has them.

176
00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:43,264
What do you mean?

177
00:16:43,332 --> 00:16:46,324
- Reverend?
- You're a believer, aren't you?

178
00:16:46,402 --> 00:16:50,839
- This has nothing to do with me, sir.
- Has everything to do with you.

179
00:16:50,906 --> 00:16:54,637
You have faith.
Have had faith.

180
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,008
You hear Him calling you,

181
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:59,343
but you're unsure
of what to do.

182
00:16:59,415 --> 00:17:01,610
It's not exactly
a long shot, sir.

183
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:04,050
You stand as you do now,

184
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:07,145
neither here nor there,
longing,

185
00:17:07,222 --> 00:17:11,215
but afraid, waiting for a sign.

186
00:17:11,293 --> 00:17:14,023
Well, the signs are everywhere.

187
00:17:14,096 --> 00:17:16,564
What happened to the inmates, sir?

188
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:21,168
Everything has a reason,
Scout...

189
00:17:21,236 --> 00:17:24,672
everything on God's earth.

190
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,038
Every moment of every day...

191
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:29,202
the devil waits
for but an instant.

192
00:17:30,346 --> 00:17:33,713
As it is, it has always been,

193
00:17:33,782 --> 00:17:38,515
the devil's instant
is our eternity.

194
00:17:44,393 --> 00:17:47,294
The good reverend.
How do you do?

195
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:49,695
Or maybe I should say,
how do you do it?

196
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:51,699
His is the word.

197
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:54,099
I am but the messenger
who delivers it.

198
00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:58,003
- Well, this delivery
arrived a little late.

199
00:17:58,073 --> 00:18:00,098
A little late
and a little cold,

200
00:18:00,175 --> 00:18:02,234
as a matter of fact.

201
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:04,745
I thought you'd want
to see it.

202
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:06,781
What is this?

203
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:08,840
Blood of the lamb, Reverend.

204
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:10,942
The handiwork
of Mr. Donny Faster.

205
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,751
- Ayoung girl he picked up
at the bus stop.
- Oh, Lord.

206
00:18:14,823 --> 00:18:17,018
Where is he, Reverend?

207
00:18:19,595 --> 00:18:21,529
He took my car.

208
00:18:21,597 --> 00:18:24,862
She wasn't supposed to die.

209
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:27,094
No, Donny was
supposed to die.

210
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:28,898
You were supposed
to kill him.

211
00:18:28,971 --> 00:18:31,064
That's why you freed him.

212
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,438
God knows
you're capable of it.

213
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:36,069
Rev. Orison is really
Robert Gailen Orison,

214
00:18:36,145 --> 00:18:38,909
convicted in 1959
of first degree murder.

215
00:18:38,981 --> 00:18:41,779
Served 22 years in Solidad.

216
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,648
God spoke to me.

217
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,382
He told me to look
after Donny.

218
00:18:47,456 --> 00:18:49,515
When God spoke to you,
Reverend,

219
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:52,059
did He happen to mention
where Donny was headed?

220
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,069
- Where are you going, Mulder?
- To prove that man's a liar.

221
00:19:01,136 --> 00:19:04,572
How do you prove that somebody
isn't being directed by God?

222
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,972
You don't believe
that it happened?

223
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:10,273
God is a spectator, Scully.
He just reads the box scores.

224
00:19:10,345 --> 00:19:15,282
- I don't believe that.
- You think God directs that man,
directs him to kill?

225
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:19,309
Donny Faster isn't dead and
we don't know the other inmates
who escaped are dead either.

226
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:23,381
So, what?
You think God directs him to...

227
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:25,427
let the prisoners out to kill?

228
00:19:25,494 --> 00:19:28,554
No, but I believe that the reverend
believes what's he's saying...

229
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,598
that it's God
working through him.

230
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,930
Well, plenty of nut bags do.

231
00:19:34,703 --> 00:19:36,796
Has He ever spoken to you?

232
00:19:38,006 --> 00:19:39,997
I'm trying not
to take offense.

233
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:43,067
What did He say?

234
00:19:44,613 --> 00:19:48,310
Mulder, I have heard
that song three times now.

235
00:19:48,383 --> 00:19:51,375
That may not mean anything to you,
but it means something to me.

236
00:19:51,453 --> 00:19:54,320
- What does it mean?
- I never thought about it before.

237
00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:58,450
It never meant anything
to me until yesterday
when it made me remember something.

238
00:19:58,527 --> 00:20:00,927
What?

239
00:20:00,996 --> 00:20:04,830
When I was 13, my father
was stationed in San Diego.

240
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,993
I was listening to the radio
to that song...

241
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:10,664
when my mother came in and told me that
my Sunday schoolteacher had been killed.

242
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:16,075
- Mmm.
- He'd been murdered in his front yard.

243
00:20:16,145 --> 00:20:19,740
And that's the first time I ever felt
there was real evil in the world.

244
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:25,785
Mulder, Rev. Orison
called me "Scout."

245
00:20:25,854 --> 00:20:28,584
That's the same name
my Sunday schoolteacher called me.

246
00:20:28,657 --> 00:20:32,115
Donny Faster escaped
from prison at 6:06 a.m.

247
00:20:32,194 --> 00:20:36,824
That's exactly the same time
that I woke up yesterday
morning when my power went out.

248
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:41,261
So, what do you think
that God is telling you?

249
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,071
Yeah, all right. Come with me, Scout.
I'll show you how the reverend
talks to God.

250
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:52,377
Police are
involved in a four-state manhunt...

251
00:20:52,445 --> 00:20:55,642
for a prisoner who escaped
maximum security in Marion, Illinois.

252
00:20:55,715 --> 00:20:58,775
He was last seen driving
a green 1970...

253
00:20:58,851 --> 00:21:01,547
Chevrolet Impala
with a black landau top.

254
00:21:01,621 --> 00:21:04,556
He is described as
six feet tall, medium build...

255
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:41,059
It's a cerebral edema.

256
00:21:42,328 --> 00:21:44,353
A swelling of the brain.

257
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,763
A trauma not uncommon with
this kind of head injury or accident.

258
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:49,734
Except this isn't accidental.

259
00:21:49,802 --> 00:21:52,965
The cause, in fact, as it was stated
to me, is self-inflicted.

260
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,202
There's a small hole here
in the skull...

261
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:58,539
which allows oxygen
into the brain cavity.

262
00:21:58,611 --> 00:22:01,876
The result of which
is the Rev. Orison has three
times the normal blood volume...

263
00:22:01,948 --> 00:22:04,178
pumping through his brain.

264
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,878
- And he did this himself?
- Yeah.

265
00:22:06,953 --> 00:22:09,820
My guess is he probably did it
when he first got into prison...

266
00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:12,619
when he first learned
how to use its powers.

267
00:22:12,692 --> 00:22:15,183
- "Its powers"?
- There's a theory...

268
00:22:15,261 --> 00:22:18,162
that at this point in human evolution
our mental capabilities...

269
00:22:18,231 --> 00:22:20,631
are limited only by
inadequate blood supply.

270
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,668
In fact, centuries ago
in the Peruvian Andes,

271
00:22:22,735 --> 00:22:26,569
holy men used to physically
remove parts of their skull in
order to increase blood volume,

272
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:28,664
or drill small holes.

273
00:22:28,741 --> 00:22:33,178
So this hole in his head enables Rev.
Orison to help these prisoners escape?

274
00:22:33,246 --> 00:22:35,578
Yeah.
The practitioners of this...

275
00:22:35,648 --> 00:22:39,106
found that they could perform
certain mental tricks.

276
00:22:39,185 --> 00:22:41,653
One of which they called
"stopping the world."

277
00:22:41,721 --> 00:22:45,680
Nobody can stop the world. I don't care
how many holes they have in their head.

278
00:22:45,758 --> 00:22:47,953
But maybe they can
alter perception of it,

279
00:22:48,027 --> 00:22:51,827
creating a disparate version
of reality which they can then
project through hypnosis.

280
00:22:51,898 --> 00:22:54,526
But why? I mean,
even if you could, why?

281
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,696
Donny Faster is serving a life sentence
without possibility of parole.

282
00:22:58,771 --> 00:23:03,208
That's the final judgment
as far as society is concerned,
but not in the eyes of God...

283
00:23:03,276 --> 00:23:05,744
or in the eyes of a man
who thinks he's God's tool.

284
00:23:05,811 --> 00:23:08,837
Well, then if Rev. Orison
meant to kill Donny Faster,

285
00:23:08,915 --> 00:23:10,849
then why is he still alive?

286
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:13,852
I don't know. Maybe he unleashed
something that he couldn't control.

287
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,287
Maybe he thought he was
opening the door of perception,

288
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:22,259
but then unwittingly
he... opened the gates of hell.

289
00:23:35,808 --> 00:23:37,742
What?

290
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:42,110
Glory. Amen.
Glory. Amen.

291
00:23:42,181 --> 00:23:44,342
- Glory. Amen.

292
00:24:35,868 --> 00:24:37,802
Are you Donald?

293
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,599
Yes.

294
00:24:39,672 --> 00:24:42,470
I'm from Tip Top
Gentlemen Service.

295
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:59,318
This isn't your place,
is it?

296
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:02,088
- No. Why?
- 'Cause I was coming up the stairs...

297
00:25:02,161 --> 00:25:05,619
and got stopped by the landlord,
like it's any of his business.

298
00:25:05,698 --> 00:25:08,258
He told me some
Rev. Orison lives here.

299
00:25:09,435 --> 00:25:12,029
- Now, you ain't no preacher, are you?
- No.

300
00:25:12,104 --> 00:25:15,540
Good. They always like
the weirdest things.

301
00:25:18,077 --> 00:25:20,910
You know what I mean?

302
00:25:37,263 --> 00:25:39,959
- You okay?
- Yes.

303
00:25:41,467 --> 00:25:43,458
Something you wanna say?

304
00:25:47,606 --> 00:25:50,040
Love your hair.

305
00:26:11,297 --> 00:26:13,629
What are you doin'?

306
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:15,690
Is your hair
chemically treated?

307
00:26:15,768 --> 00:26:17,497
My hair?

308
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:21,267
I don't know
which product to use.

309
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,275
Look, you're not usin' no product.
I'm clean, my hair's clean.

310
00:26:24,343 --> 00:26:28,939
- If you're gonna be that weird
about it, I ought to just leave.
- I'm being a gentleman.

311
00:26:29,014 --> 00:26:33,041
Well, be a gentleman and get me a towel.
I'm gonna get out of here.

312
00:26:56,775 --> 00:26:59,107
It's a wig.

313
00:27:01,013 --> 00:27:03,641
They lied to me.

314
00:27:06,318 --> 00:27:08,718
You lied to me!

315
00:27:24,503 --> 00:27:27,404
- Where'd he go?
- Marshal?

316
00:27:30,876 --> 00:27:33,504
- Marshal?
- What?

317
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:37,675
The prisoner, the man you were guarding
in this room, what happened to him?

318
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,241
He's gone, Scully.
So is the marshal's gun.

319
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,754
You didn't see him?

320
00:27:47,126 --> 00:27:49,060
Let's go, Scully.

321
00:27:55,901 --> 00:27:59,860
-  What is it?
- What does this mean?

322
00:28:04,376 --> 00:28:07,174
- Did you tell him?
- No, I only told you.

323
00:28:07,246 --> 00:28:11,182
He must have, uh, overheard us
when we were talking in the hallway.

324
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,309
I didn't mention
the name of the song.

325
00:28:13,385 --> 00:28:15,512
- I'm sure you did.
- No, I'm sure I didn't, Mulder.

326
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:19,883
Well, maybe this was
meant for you.

327
00:28:21,093 --> 00:28:23,789
"Don't look any further."

328
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:47,406
"Whosoever sheddeth
man's blood,

329
00:28:48,652 --> 00:28:52,645
by man shall his blood
be shed."

330
00:28:52,723 --> 00:28:55,487
What are you doing?

331
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,323
Taking you home.

332
00:29:00,897 --> 00:29:04,993
"The wicked
will be punished."

333
00:29:18,982 --> 00:29:21,576
Pray for God's love, Donny.

334
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:28,388
Find the humility in yourself
to allow God into your heart.

335
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:31,859
All you have to do
is believe.

336
00:29:31,928 --> 00:29:33,759
Repent.

337
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,698
You'll feel God's love come to show you
the way to His heavenly kingdom.

338
00:29:40,971 --> 00:29:42,962
Are you sorry
for what you've done?

339
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,235
You...

340
00:29:45,308 --> 00:29:47,970
What did you say?

341
00:29:48,045 --> 00:29:50,809
Never... No...

342
00:29:50,881 --> 00:29:52,815
No...

343
00:29:54,051 --> 00:29:58,249
- Why are you crying?
- I can't...

344
00:29:58,321 --> 00:30:01,154
Beg His forgiveness
for what you did to those girls,

345
00:30:01,224 --> 00:30:05,160
for what you did to all
those poor helpless girls.

346
00:30:05,228 --> 00:30:09,255
My violence is always
waiting for an instant...

347
00:30:09,332 --> 00:30:12,233
for when His back
is turned.

348
00:30:13,303 --> 00:30:15,430
You can see it now.

349
00:30:15,505 --> 00:30:19,839
Are you crying for your sins...
or for yourself?

350
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,935
No, Reverend.

351
00:30:22,012 --> 00:30:24,310
I cry for you.

352
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:27,976
Because you cannot kill me.

353
00:30:50,073 --> 00:30:53,634
You know, it's funny.
When all is said and done, there's...

354
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:56,736
not much mystery in murder.

355
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,611
And for that,
I owe you an apology, Mulder.

356
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:03,619
- What do you mean?
- Well, you were right.

357
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:06,884
I was looking too hard for connections
that weren't there.

358
00:31:06,957 --> 00:31:10,222
Orison was a murderer,
plain and simple.

359
00:31:10,293 --> 00:31:13,820
He liberated those prisoners
so he could bring them out here
and pass judgment on them.

360
00:31:13,897 --> 00:31:18,266
I guess in his own twisted way
he was making good with his God.

361
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:22,203
Glory. Amen.
Let's go home, Scully.

362
00:31:22,272 --> 00:31:26,572
Donny Faster placed the call
to the police that led us out here.

363
00:31:26,643 --> 00:31:29,009
It's almost like he's
begging us to hunt him down.

364
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:33,880
This X-File is over. Lying dead there
in a grave he dug himself.

365
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,009
Let's let the U.S. Marshals
take over from here.

366
00:31:39,122 --> 00:31:41,090
Don't look any further, Scully.

367
00:33:52,455 --> 00:33:55,652
- This is Fox Mulder.
Leave a message after the...

368
00:33:55,725 --> 00:33:59,217
- Agent Mulder,
MarshalJoe Danno in Marion.

369
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:02,595
I just talked to a call girl who I.D. 'd
Donny Faster as an attacker.

370
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:05,931
Claims Faster got real upset
when she was wearing a red wig...

371
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,936
upset she wasn't a redhead.

372
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,132
This mean anything to you?
I'd appreciate a call back.

373
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:24,077
Go back to hell!

374
00:35:27,183 --> 00:35:30,778
- Who does your nails, girly girl?
- Let me go!

375
00:35:30,854 --> 00:35:34,620
The only reason why you're alive
is because I asked the judge for life!

376
00:35:34,691 --> 00:35:38,252
The only reason why you're alive
is because we didn't kill you
when we could!

377
00:35:38,328 --> 00:35:40,387
You're the one
that got away.

378
00:35:42,365 --> 00:35:45,459
- You're all I think about.
- I'm a federal agent.

379
00:35:45,535 --> 00:35:48,561
You do anything to me and they
will not give you a break this time.

380
00:35:48,638 --> 00:35:51,471
I'm going to run you a bath.

381
00:36:12,662 --> 00:36:15,893
Don't look any further

382
00:36:34,915 --> 00:36:38,112
Now, be good and don't
cause me any problems.

383
00:37:59,232 --> 00:38:01,826
Someone to count on

384
00:38:01,902 --> 00:38:03,767
In a world ever changing

385
00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:09,839
Here I am
Stop where you're standing

386
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,401
What you need is a lover

387
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:15,778
Someone to take over

388
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:19,717
- Oh, girl, don't look any further

389
00:38:21,087 --> 00:38:23,453
And it's strange

390
00:38:37,137 --> 00:38:39,162
Oh, baby

391
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:42,140
Don't look any further

392
00:38:42,209 --> 00:38:44,439
Tonight

393
00:38:44,511 --> 00:38:47,503
We're gonna take it

394
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:53,650
All night long, baby, daylight

395
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,654
Daylight

396
00:38:55,722 --> 00:39:00,318
I'll still be lookin'
in your heavenly eyes

397
00:39:00,393 --> 00:39:04,022
And we'll go on and on

398
00:39:11,137 --> 00:39:13,503
Don't look any further

399
00:39:21,748 --> 00:39:24,376
Don't look any further

400
00:39:24,451 --> 00:39:27,079
Someone to count on

401
00:39:27,153 --> 00:39:29,986
In a world ever changing

402
00:39:30,056 --> 00:39:31,990
Here I am, baby

403
00:39:32,058 --> 00:39:35,027
Stop right
where you're standing

404
00:39:35,095 --> 00:39:37,495
What you need
is a lover

405
00:39:37,564 --> 00:39:40,590
Someone to take over

406
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:44,899
Here I am, baby
Don't look any further

407
00:39:44,971 --> 00:39:46,700
Further

408
00:42:05,512 --> 00:42:08,538
- Excuse me.
-  Yeah, sure.

409
00:42:18,925 --> 00:42:21,917
If you want to pack some things,
we can get out of here.

410
00:42:32,205 --> 00:42:35,572
- You can't judge yourself.

411
00:42:41,114 --> 00:42:43,378
Maybe I don't have to.

412
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,975
The Bible allows for vengeance.

413
00:42:46,052 --> 00:42:49,078
But the law doesn't.

414
00:42:50,323 --> 00:42:53,815
The way I see it,
he didn't give you a choice.

415
00:42:55,628 --> 00:42:58,188
And my report will reflect that,

416
00:42:58,264 --> 00:43:00,755
in case you're worried.

417
00:43:00,834 --> 00:43:04,361
Donny Faster would have surely
killed again if given the chance.

418
00:43:04,437 --> 00:43:07,372
He was evil, Mulder.

419
00:43:08,942 --> 00:43:11,536
I'm sure about that
without a doubt.

420
00:43:11,611 --> 00:43:13,841
But there's one thing
that I'm not sure of.

421
00:43:13,913 --> 00:43:16,245
What's that?

422
00:43:16,316 --> 00:43:18,910
Who was at work in me?

423
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,554
Or what?

424
00:43:23,623 --> 00:43:25,557
What made me...

425
00:43:26,826 --> 00:43:28,919
What made me
pull the trigger?

426
00:43:29,996 --> 00:43:32,294
You mean if it was God?

427
00:43:33,466 --> 00:43:36,731
I mean, what if it wasn't?
