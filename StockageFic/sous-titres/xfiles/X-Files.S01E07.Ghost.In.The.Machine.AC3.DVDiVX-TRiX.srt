00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:20,394
lt was an incoming call.

182
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,266
From somewhere
in the Eurisko building itself.

183
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:29,172
Whoever set the trap wanted to
make sure that Drake took the bait.

184
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:31,767
Excellent work, Agent Lamana.

185
00:10:31,844 --> 00:10:33,334
Thankyou.

186
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:43,617
jerry, what the hell
areyou doing?

187
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,851
Hey, don't get
all bent out ofshape.

188
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:47,392
jerry, that was
my profile.

189
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:52,488
Look, l didn't think
you'd mind.

190
00:10:52,565 --> 00:10:55,762
Anyway, theywerejust notes.
l filled in the blanks.

191
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:59,326
jerry, you went into my office
and you stole mywork.

192
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:00,667
Look, you're
on this case...

193
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,435
'cause l asked you
to help me out,

194
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:03,600
and you helped me out.

195
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:04,904
What is the big deal?

196
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:13,218
What did he say?

197
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:17,518
He apologized
in his own way.

198
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,682
l just got
offthe phone...

199
00:11:18,758 --> 00:11:21,693
with Peterson,
the systems engineer.

200
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:23,729
One name? Brad Wilczek?

201
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:25,696
He said it would be
a short list.

202
00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:28,666
lt's headline news
this guy despised Drake.

203
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:29,929
That seems too obvious.

204
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:32,504
To kill Drake would be
so brazenly egomaniacal.

205
00:11:32,572 --> 00:11:33,664
And fully consistent...

206
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:36,241
withJerry's excellent
behavioral profile.

207
00:11:36,342 --> 00:11:37,934
Fully.

208
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:07,739
This is what a 220 l.Q and a $400
million severance settlement buys you.

209
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:19,683
Yes?

210
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:21,379

211
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:23,945
We're with the F.B.l.

212
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:26,856
What tookyou guys so long?

213
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:31,762
Oh, doyou mind
taking offyour shoes?

214
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:37,628
You can divide
the computer science industry...

215
00:12:37,737 --> 00:12:41,537
into two types ofpeople--
neat and scruffy.

216
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:44,201

fit into the first category.

217
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:46,245

like things neat.

218
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:47,802
Theywear
nicely pressed suits...

219
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,643
and work
on surface phenomena--

220
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:51,580
things they can understand--

221
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:54,620
market shares
and third quarter profits.

222
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:56,245
And you had
a different vision...

223
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:57,846
for the company?

224
00:12:57,924 --> 00:12:59,892
l started Eurisko
out ofmy parents' garage.

225
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:02,519

just spent a year...

226
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:05,359
following around
the Grateful Dead.

227
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:08,127
You know what
Eurisko means?

228
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:10,725
That's from the Greek,
isn't it?

229
00:13:10,837 --> 00:13:12,464
"l learn things."

230
00:13:12,572 --> 00:13:13,504
Not exactly.

231
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:15,541
lt means
"l discover things."

232
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:17,007
Unfortunately, Ben Drake
wasn't interested...

233
00:13:17,076 --> 00:13:18,236
in discovery.

234
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:23,647
He was a shortsighted,
power-hungry opportunist.

235
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:27,151
Let me showyou
the smart home.

236
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,653

l have access

237
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:30,484
to every square foot
ofmy house.

238
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:31,750

as Fort Knox...

239
00:13:31,824 --> 00:13:35,282
and as energy efficient
as your average igloo.

240
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:37,693
We were twoyears ahead
of Microsoft and Cebus...

241
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:42,063
when Drake, in his infinite
wisdom, killed the program.

242
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:45,467
ls this system related
to the one in your building?

243
00:13:45,538 --> 00:13:46,937
Variation on a theme.

244
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:50,874
How many people know the system
well enough to override it?

245
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:52,740
Finally, the bonus question.

246
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:55,076
" Not many" is the answer.

247
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:59,448
Could someone have
hacked into the system?

248
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,977
Well, notyour average
phone freak, that's for sure.

Could you have done it?

254
00:14:12,298 --> 00:14:13,458
Ofcourse.

255
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:15,295

260
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:29,305

Don'tdo this!

00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:01,351
Oh, my God.

392
00:24:01,854 --> 00:24:04,186
l heard aboutJerry.

393
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:08,086
l'm sorry.

394
00:24:09,161 --> 00:24:13,222
l don't think
Wilczek did it.

395
00:24:13,298 --> 00:24:15,391
What?

396
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:17,765
lt doesn't make sense.

397
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:20,100
Whywould he
go back to Eurisko?

398
00:24:20,172 --> 00:24:22,936
To destroy evidence,
to cover his tracks.

399
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:25,441
lfyou were going
to destroy evidence,

400
00:24:25,511 --> 00:24:27,945
would you pose
for the cameras?

401
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:41,550
Mulder--

402
00:24:43,362 --> 00:24:46,490
You've been through a lot--

403
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:49,295
more than l think
even you realize.

404
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:55,096
l thinkWilczek
is smarter than this.

405
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:04,777
Hejust signed
a confession.

406
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:09,486
How much proof
doyou need?

407
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:35,109
This is a crime scene.

408
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,374
Please leave.

409
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:38,348
l know.
l ordered the subpoena.

410
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:40,612
That subpoena's
been obviated.

411
00:25:40,686 --> 00:25:42,654
What areyou
talking about?

412
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:45,019
Unless you've got
a code five clearance,

413
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,786
l'm going to have
to askyou to turn back.

414
00:26:15,287 --> 00:26:17,084
Thanks for coming.

415
00:26:17,155 --> 00:26:18,850
l'm here against
my betterjudgment.

416
00:26:18,924 --> 00:26:20,755
ln the future,
l must insist...

417
00:26:20,826 --> 00:26:23,590
thatyou respect the terms
ofour arrangement.

418
00:26:23,662 --> 00:26:25,960
l need to know
why Brad Wilczek...

419
00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:28,295
is the subject of
a code five investigation--

420
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:30,699
what the Defense Department
wants with him.

421
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:33,363
What doyou think
they'd want...

422
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:35,736
with the most innovative
programmer in this hemisphere?

423
00:26:35,807 --> 00:26:37,172
Software.

424
00:26:37,276 --> 00:26:39,836
Foryears, Wilczek
has thumbed his nose...

425
00:26:39,945 --> 00:26:42,778
at any contract involving
weapons applications.

426
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:44,179
He's a bleeding heart.

427
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:45,614
What kind
ofsoftware?

428
00:26:45,684 --> 00:26:47,015
How much doyou know...

429
00:26:47,085 --> 00:26:51,181
about artificial
intelligence?

430
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:53,349
l thought it was
only theoretical.

431
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:55,620
lt was,
until twoyears ago.

432
00:26:55,694 --> 00:26:57,093
Doyou remember Helsinki--

433
00:26:57,162 --> 00:26:59,460
the first time
a chess-playing computer

434
00:26:59,531 --> 00:27:00,862
beat a grand master?

435
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:02,798
That was
Wilczek's program.

436
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:05,098
And the rumorwas
that he did it...

437
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,968
by developing the first
adaptive network.

438
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,167
An adaptive network?

439
00:27:10,275 --> 00:27:12,743
lt's a learning machine--

440
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:14,904
a computer
that actually thinks.

441
00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:19,643
And it's, uh, become
something ofa holy grail...

442
00:27:19,718 --> 00:27:21,948
for some ofour more
acquisitive colleagues...

443
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,817
in the Department
of Defense.

444
00:27:26,658 --> 00:27:29,149
They make me wear shoes
all the time.

445
00:27:29,227 --> 00:27:30,854
What else doyou
want from me?

446
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:34,330
Tell me whyyou're willing
to spend your life in prison...

447
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,526
for a crime
you didn't commit.

448
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:37,966
What areyou
talking about?

449
00:27:38,036 --> 00:27:39,230
l'm guilty.

450
00:27:39,304 --> 00:27:41,499
l knowyou're innocent.

451
00:27:41,573 --> 00:27:43,404
You're protecting a machine--

452
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:46,636
the central operating system
at Eurisko.

453
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,740
lfl'm protecting anything,
it's not the machine.

454
00:27:52,517 --> 00:27:54,382
Then what?

455
00:27:57,389 --> 00:28:03,658
After the bomb was dropped
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

456
00:28:03,729 --> 00:28:05,993
Robert Oppenheimer
spent the rest ofhis life...

457
00:28:06,064 --> 00:28:09,056
regretting he'd ever glimpsed
an atom.

458
00:28:09,201 --> 00:28:11,294
Oppenheimer may have
regretted his actions,

459
00:28:11,403 --> 00:28:14,031
but he never denied
responsibility for them.

460
00:28:14,106 --> 00:28:17,234
He loved the work, Mr. Mulder.

461
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:22,872
His mistake was in sharing it
with an immoral government.

462
00:28:22,948 --> 00:28:25,712
l won't make the same mistake.

463
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:28,309
Butyour machine killed Drake.

464
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:31,322
And it killed my friend.

465
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:38,828
l'm sorry about what happened,
but there's nothing l can do.

466
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:40,762
And you talk about morality.

467
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,732
You're afraid
ofthe government,

468
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:45,770
butyou'll risk thatyour
machine will kill again.

469
00:28:45,871 --> 00:28:48,203
The lesser oftwo evils.

470
00:28:48,273 --> 00:28:51,674
What about a third option?

471
00:28:53,879 --> 00:28:56,006
You created that machine.

472
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:59,346
Nowyou tell me
how to destroy it.

473
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:04,147
Wilczek can createa virus...

474
00:29:04,222 --> 00:29:05,621
that will destroy
the system.

475
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,420
Blaming the machine
is an alibi-- a bad one.

476
00:29:08,493 --> 00:29:10,688
lt's the only thing
that makes sense.

477
00:29:10,796 --> 00:29:12,093
The C.O.S. project...

478
00:29:12,197 --> 00:29:13,960
was posting big losses
for Eurisko.

479
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:16,398
Drake was about
to terminate the program.

480
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:17,935
So the machine
killed Drake...

481
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:19,264
out ofself-defense?

482
00:29:19,337 --> 00:29:20,634
Self-preservation.

483
00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:23,503
lt's the primary instinct
ofall sentient beings.

484
00:29:23,575 --> 00:29:25,873
That level
ofartificial intelligence...

485
00:29:25,944 --> 00:29:27,775
is decades away
from being realized.

486
00:29:27,846 --> 00:29:29,370
Then whywas
our government...

487
00:29:29,448 --> 00:29:31,643
trying to usurp
Wilczek's research?

488
00:29:31,716 --> 00:29:34,344
Mulder, l thinkyou're
looking for something...

489
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:37,081
that isn't there,

490
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:39,988
and l think it has
something to do withJerry.

491
00:29:41,426 --> 00:29:45,692
Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad
idea ifyou talked to someone.

492
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:50,792
You're probably right.

493
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:52,764
Where areyou going?

494
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:54,829
To talk to someone.

495
00:30:19,998 --> 00:30:23,024
How much time doyou need?

This is Special Agent

l.D. number 231 7-61 6.

502
00:31:16,588 --> 00:31:20,319
l need you to run a quick trace
on a number for me.

503
00:31:20,392 --> 00:31:25,455
Yeah. 202-555-6431 .

Yeah. That's my number.

505

507
00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:57,652
Scully, what areyou doing here?

508
00:31:57,762 --> 00:32:01,095
Someone or something's been
scanning my computer files,

509
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:02,292
tapping my phones.

510
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,560
l traced the line.

511
00:32:03,668 --> 00:32:05,795
lt came from
somewhere in there.

512
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:10,101
lt's the machine.

513
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,910
How can we get in?

514

537
00:36:37,308 --> 00:36:40,368
What areyou doing here?

538
00:36:40,445 --> 00:36:42,606
( AirRushing )

539
00:36:49,454 --> 00:36:50,648
( Coughing )

540
00:37:17,448 --> 00:37:20,713
( Screams )

541
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:03,955
The machine's
been acting all crazy.

542
00:38:04,028 --> 00:38:06,019
Power surges, shut-offs.

543
00:38:06,097 --> 00:38:08,292
That's why l'm here so late.

544
00:38:08,366 --> 00:38:09,799
Where's the B port?

545
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:11,892
Oh, it's right back here.

546
00:38:20,211 --> 00:38:23,578
Look, areyou sure
you know whatyou're doing?

547
00:38:23,648 --> 00:38:27,106
Because ifyou don't,
it's myjob on the line.

548
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,485
Damn!

549
00:39:13,164 --> 00:39:15,359
System access granted.

550
00:39:15,466 --> 00:39:17,491
User code, level seven.

551
00:39:17,602 --> 00:39:19,797
Now l can put in the virus.

552
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:23,567
Not bad, Agent Mulder.

553
00:39:23,641 --> 00:39:24,733
l've been trying...

554
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:27,869
to access the C.P.U.
for the past twoyears.

555
00:39:27,945 --> 00:39:30,106
Now, please,
take outyour gun...

556
00:39:30,181 --> 00:39:31,512
and remove the clip.

557
00:39:37,021 --> 00:39:38,420
Careful.

558
00:39:42,694 --> 00:39:45,219
Defense Department?

559
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:48,890
Let'sjust say our paychecks
are signed by the same person.

560
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,025
Now give me the diskette...

561
00:39:51,135 --> 00:39:54,161
and step away
from the console.

562
00:39:54,272 --> 00:39:58,504
You don't want to test
my resolve, Agent Mulder.

563
00:40:03,381 --> 00:40:05,349
Put down the gun.

564
00:40:07,652 --> 00:40:11,349
Look, you may thinkyou know
whatyou're dealing with--

565
00:40:11,422 --> 00:40:12,980
Shut up and drop the gun.

566
00:40:17,562 --> 00:40:20,690
You're making a mistake,
Agent Scully.

567
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:26,928
Compromising your sworn duty.

568
00:40:27,038 --> 00:40:31,498
This operation is more sensitive
than you can possibly imagine.

569
00:40:31,576 --> 00:40:32,600
Don't listen to him.

570
00:40:32,677 --> 00:40:35,009
The technology
in this machine...

571
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:37,445
is ofenormous
scientific interest.

572
00:40:37,515 --> 00:40:39,073
lt's killed
two people.

573
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,344
Theywon't be able...

574
00:40:40,418 --> 00:40:42,545
to handle it
any better than Wilczek.

575
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,212
Make no mistake,

576
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,950
you will be held accountable.

577
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:51,952
Mulder, put in the disk.

578
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:57,832
What areyou doing, Brad?

579
00:40:57,902 --> 00:41:00,462
Don't do this, Brad.

580
00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:05,702
( Speaking Gibberish )

581
00:41:38,576 --> 00:41:40,441
Brad... Brad...

582
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:44,947
Brad...

583
00:41:45,016 --> 00:41:48,042
Why?

584
00:42:12,176 --> 00:42:13,973
Mulder: l talked with
Congressman Klevenaugh...

585
00:42:14,045 --> 00:42:15,740
and the Department
ofCorrections subcommittee.

586
00:42:15,813 --> 00:42:18,077
l even petitioned
the Attorney General's office.

587
00:42:18,149 --> 00:42:19,582
You won't find him.

588
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,551
They can'tjust take a man
like Brad Wilczek...

589
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,609
without an explanation.

590
00:42:23,688 --> 00:42:28,091
They can do
anything theywant.

591
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:30,024
Where is he?

592
00:42:30,094 --> 00:42:32,824
ln the middle of
what we in the trade...

593
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:34,295
call "hard bargaining."

594
00:42:34,398 --> 00:42:36,195
Wilczekwon't deal.

595
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,291
He'll neverwork for them.

596
00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:41,166
Loss offreedom does
funny things to a man,

597
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:43,104
and remember,
Wilczek confessed...

598
00:42:43,174 --> 00:42:46,439
to two murders, and you
effectively destroyed...

599
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,034
the only evidence...

600
00:42:48,112 --> 00:42:49,909
that could have
exonerated him.

601
00:42:49,981 --> 00:42:51,744
What else could l have done?

602
00:42:51,816 --> 00:42:53,841
Nothing,

603
00:42:53,918 --> 00:42:58,855
unless you were willing
to let the technology survive.

604
00:42:58,923 --> 00:43:01,983
The Department of Defense
still hasn't found anything?

605
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:04,254
They've been on it
for five days.

606
00:43:04,328 --> 00:43:06,796
Wilczek's virus was thorough.

607
00:43:06,898 --> 00:43:11,631
lt left no trace
ofthe artificial intelligence.

608
00:43:11,702 --> 00:43:13,897
The machine is dead.

609
00:43:28,185 --> 00:43:31,951
Peterson: We've pushed the pulse code
modulations to the limit.

610
00:43:32,023 --> 00:43:33,615
Nothing.

611
00:43:37,561 --> 00:43:39,995
We've combed
the parsing subroutine.

612
00:43:40,097 --> 00:43:41,894
Yes, sir. Twice.

613
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:45,264
No, sir, still nothing,
but l'd like to request--

614
00:43:49,907 --> 00:43:50,999
Yes, sir.

615
00:43:51,075 --> 00:43:53,543
No, l understand.

616
00:43:53,611 --> 00:43:55,306
Yes, sir.

617
00:43:56,547 --> 00:43:57,741
Well,

618
00:43:57,815 --> 00:43:58,941
six more hours...

619
00:43:59,016 --> 00:44:02,076
before we have to consign
the whole damn thing...

620
00:44:02,153 --> 00:44:03,381
to the metal shredder.

621
00:44:03,454 --> 00:44:06,287
We'll do what
we can, sir.

622
00:44:30,648 --> 00:44:33,310
l'm going to figure
this thing out...

623
00:44:33,384 --> 00:44:35,545
ifit kills me.
