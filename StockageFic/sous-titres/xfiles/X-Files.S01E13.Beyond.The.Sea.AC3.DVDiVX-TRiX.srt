1
00:00:05,352 --> 00:00:08,082
Areyou going to leave this up
all year?

2
00:00:08,155 --> 00:00:10,919
Yup. All year.

3
00:00:10,991 --> 00:00:12,925
Sinceyou always made us
take the Christmas tree down

4
00:00:12,993 --> 00:00:16,690
the day after Christmas,
I'm making up for lost time.

5
00:00:16,763 --> 00:00:21,223
Ifyour idea ofa good time is picking
up dried pine needles, treatyourself.

6
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:25,294
As ifhe's an authority
on having a good time.

7
00:00:25,372 --> 00:00:26,999
That's okay, Mom.
I got that.

8
00:00:27,107 --> 00:00:28,938
Oh. Okay.

9
00:00:29,042 --> 00:00:30,976
Okay, Maggie,
let's shove off.

10
00:00:31,044 --> 00:00:33,808
Oh. Okay.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,609
Thankyou for having us.

12
00:00:35,682 --> 00:00:37,445
Dinnerwas delicious
as usual.

13
00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:39,109
Thanks, Mom.

14
00:00:41,588 --> 00:00:44,216
Good sailing, Ahab.

15
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,259
Good night, Starbuck.

16
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:53,299
How is work? Good?

17
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:56,200
Yup. It's good.

18
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:58,134
Well...

19
00:01:04,578 --> 00:01:06,978
- Well, drive carefully.
- Uh-huh.

20
00:01:12,552 --> 00:01:14,543
Good night, Daddy.

21
00:01:19,092 --> 00:01:21,026
(Applause)

22
00:01:21,094 --> 00:01:22,857
Here on lncredible lnventions though

23
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:25,397
you're not going to spend
$1 1 0.00 for it.

24
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:26,932
You all know that.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,127
You're not even going
to spend $1 00.00.

26
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:31,636
There's an approximate
one-month supply here

27
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:34,196
and all you'll spend
for this entire package

28
00:01:34,274 --> 00:01:37,243
isjust $39.92.

29
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,210
(Applause And Cheering)

00:01:44,284 --> 00:01:47,879
(No Audio
From Scully's Father)

31
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:50,548
Dad?

32
00:01:52,626 --> 00:01:56,426
I thoughtyou guys left.

33
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:58,828
Where's Mom?

34
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:01,800
(No Audio)

35
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:04,632
(Phone Ringing)

36
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:09,007
(Phone Ringing)

37
00:02:17,484 --> 00:02:19,418
Hello.

38
00:02:19,486 --> 00:02:21,351
(Muffed Crying)

39
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:23,355
Hello.

40
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:27,889
Maggie:
Dana...

41
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:31,692
Mom?
What's the matter?

42
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:34,996
We, um--

43
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:38,435
We lostyour dad.

44
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:40,530
He had a...

45
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,599
a massive coronary
about an hour ago.

46
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:49,276
He's gone.

47
00:03:55,448 --> 00:03:59,475
(Kissing, Man Chuckling)

48
00:03:59,553 --> 00:04:02,954
Woman:
I swear, Christmas day...

49
00:04:03,023 --> 00:04:06,459
mywhole family's
opening presents and all

50
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:10,519
and I'm just sitting there
in my own little world thinking

51
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:13,122
"I just wishJim were here."

52
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:14,757
Man:
I know.

53
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:20,438
(Knock On Window)

54
00:04:21,808 --> 00:04:25,107
Oh, man... busted.

55
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:30,316
- Yes, sir?
- Out ofthe vehicle, please.

56
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:33,682
Sir, I'm sorry.
We'll be on ourway.

57
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:36,415
I said, out ofthe vehicle.

58
00:04:47,434 --> 00:04:49,868
Keepyour hands down.

59
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:55,269
Let's see some l.D.

60
00:04:55,342 --> 00:04:57,936
No. Not until I seeyours.

61
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:05,143
(Screams)

62
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:20,358
Last time
you were that engrossed

63
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:23,527
it turned outyou were reading
the Adult Video News.

64
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:26,037
I didn't think
you'd be in today.

65
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:28,597
How areyou, Dana?

66
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,835
" Dana."

67
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,844
I'm fine.
Thankyou.

68
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:36,404
What areyou working on?

69
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:39,475
Two days ago a couple was
kidnapped atJackson University.

70
00:05:39,552 --> 00:05:43,886
Elizabeth Hawley
andJames Summers-- both 1 9.

71
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:46,517
Lastyear, another couple
was kidnapped to the day.

72
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:49,562
Except that abduction occurred
at Duke University.

73
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:53,156
One week later, they found
both students' bodies dead.

74
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:56,429
Theywere kept alive,
tortured during that period.

75
00:05:56,536 --> 00:05:59,437
No arrests were made. Police believed
it to be a one-time offender.

76
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:02,270
Now it appears to be
a serial incident.

77
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:07,143
Ifhe holds true to form
we have five days to find those kids.

78
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:09,477
That's a grim deadline.

79
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:11,949
Here's another
grim deadline.

80
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,112
In one week, Luther Lee Boggs
will take a seat

81
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,181
in the North Carolina
gas chamber.

82
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,420
How is he related?

83
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:24,292
He claims
to have information.

84
00:06:24,364 --> 00:06:27,458
He described Hawley's bracelet
down to the last detail.

85
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:30,195
This is information only
family members could have known.

86
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:33,272
Or the kidnapper.

87
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:37,867
Boggs feels that ifhis talents
help save these kids

88
00:06:37,944 --> 00:06:40,572
then his sentence should
be reduced to life in prison.

89
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:43,081
His "talents"?

90
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:45,413
He claims to have
obtained this information

91
00:06:45,485 --> 00:06:47,817
through psychic transmissions.

92
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:52,215
Mulder, do I detect
a hint ofskepticism?

93
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:54,089
Perhaps.

94
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,096
Boggs has been there before...
in the chamber.

95
00:06:58,164 --> 00:07:00,257
My profile helped
send him there.

96
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:02,334
He was actually
strapped to the chair

97
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:05,269
before receiving
an executive stay.

98
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:07,966
He claims that this experience
activated in him

99
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,135
the ability to channel
spirits and demons.

100
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:13,771
I believe in psychic ability
without a doubt.

101
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:17,305
But not in this case.
Not Boggs.

102
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:21,410
Soyou believe Boggs is orchestrating
the kidnapping from the inside.

103
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:26,824
A scam to save his life?

104
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:29,589
At the age ofsix,
Luther Boggs

105
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:33,098
slaughtered every pet animal
in his housing project.

106
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,761
When he was 30 he strangled five
family members overThanksgiving dinner

107
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,237
and then sat down to watch the fourth
quarter ofthe Detroit-Green Bay game.

108
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:44,299
Some killers are products
ofsociety.

109
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:47,369
Some act out past abuses.

110
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:51,747
Boggs kills because he likes it.

111
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,412
And they've requested
you speakwith him?

112
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:58,753
Actually, he's requested
to speak to me.

113
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:02,090
- Whyyou?
- He read my profile on him

114
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:06,326
and he feels like I'm the only one
who truly understands what he is.

115
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:08,900
Anyway, I leave for Raleigh
this afternoon.

116
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:11,095
I'll go with you.

117
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:15,970
The funeral is at noon.

118
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:18,704
I thinkyou should
take some time.

119
00:08:18,778 --> 00:08:20,609
I need to work.

120
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,205
I'm sorry aboutyour father.

121
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:31,380
- I'll seeyou later.
- Okay.

122
00:09:09,095 --> 00:09:11,563
As a captain he was entitled
to burial in Arlington

123
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:15,658
with full ceremony.

124
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:17,861
This is exactly
the way he wanted it.

125
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:22,506
just the family.

126
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:29,714
(" Beyond the Sea" Plays)

127
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:41,521
This song was playing when his ship
returned from the Cuban blockade.

128
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:46,224
He marched
right offup to me...

129
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:48,664
and he proposed.

130
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:57,202
I know thatyou and Dad
were... disappointed

131
00:09:57,277 --> 00:10:00,007
that I chose the path I'm on
instead ofmedicine

132
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:02,343
but I need to know.

133
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:07,982
Was he at all proud ofme?

134
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,181
He was your father.

135
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:29,869
The soul of Luther Boggs

136
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:33,242
drowns in Hell's sea offire.

137
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:41,586
We have him now.

138
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:43,918
We?

139
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,720
You mean the souls
ofyourvictims?

140
00:10:50,663 --> 00:10:53,154
The dead.

141
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:55,700
The living.

142
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:58,134
All souls are connected.

143
00:10:58,204 --> 00:11:00,640
And you're the conduit?

00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:09,706
Uh, Dana...

Fox...

147
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:16,817
please understand
that from here

148
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:20,256
we can return to the past.

149
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:24,592
We can see the present.
We can know the future.

150
00:11:24,697 --> 00:11:26,927
From here?

151
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,468
Where exactly areyou?

152
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,874
Mr. Boggs must be made
redemptive

153
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:47,476
for his transgressions.

154
00:11:47,553 --> 00:11:50,113
That's what the State
of North Carolina

155
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:52,157
intends to do next week.

156
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:57,858
Uh-uh.

157
00:11:58,965 --> 00:12:01,798
Let's deal.

158
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:05,599
Boggs' life for the kids.
You know what I'm saying?

159
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:09,129
Firstyou've got to prove
you're telling the truth.

160
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:17,672
Don't get me wrong,
Luther.

161
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:22,912
I want to believe.

162
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,588
(Groaning)

163
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,627
Oh!

164
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,429
Oh!

165
00:12:36,502 --> 00:12:38,265
God! No.

166
00:12:38,337 --> 00:12:39,804
Must stop.

167
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:42,534
Stop. Stop. Stop.
Stop!

168
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:44,667
Pain!

169
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:47,042
Pain. Terrible pain.

170
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:50,378
Um, the boy.

171
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,715
Uh,Jim.

172
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:57,051
Uh, he's tied with twine.

173
00:12:57,123 --> 00:12:59,489
Uh, packing twine.

174
00:13:01,461 --> 00:13:03,395
(Grunting)

175
00:13:09,902 --> 00:13:13,201
He whips them
with a coat hanger--

176
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:15,240
a wire coat hanger.

177
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,244
Oh.

178
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,924
Dark place.

179
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:36,295
Cold.

180
00:13:38,865 --> 00:13:40,799
A cellar.

181
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:44,569
Warehouse, condemned.

182
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,413
An angel ofstone.

183
00:13:56,682 --> 00:13:59,173
Waterfall.

184
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:02,278
Water falling.

185
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:05,119
Not a waterfall.
Not water.

186
00:14:08,227 --> 00:14:10,252
They're there.

187
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:18,367
Oh, God.
I got to go.

188
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:23,272
I got to go.
I got to go.

189
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:40,888
I tore this off
my New York Knicks T-shirt.

190
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,793
It has nothing to do
with the crime.

191
00:14:57,443 --> 00:15:03,348
* Somewhere beyond the sea *

192
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:08,044
* Somewhere waiting for me *

193
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:16,225
(Gasps)

194
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:22,257
Did you get my message,
Starbuck?

195
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:32,409
Scully, what's wrong?

196
00:15:34,313 --> 00:15:36,611
Did Boggs say something
toyou?

197
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:39,742
No.

198
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:42,845
It's my father.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

199
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:44,685
That's all right.

200
00:15:44,757 --> 00:15:48,488
Why don'tyou go back
to the motel.

201
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:50,687
We've exposed Boggs
as a fraud.

202
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:53,264
Boggs is not what
he claims to be.

203
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:55,300
He may be orchestrating
the kidnapping.

204
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:59,498
Now he knows we're onto him. He
doesn't have a chance with the charade.

205
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:02,268
I'm going to wait for a couple hours
and try to interrogate him.

206
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:05,367
Hopefully, he'll tell me
where the kids are.

207
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:08,538
* Somewhere *

208
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:10,878
* Beyond the shore *

209
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,783
*We'll kiss
just as before *

210
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:17,220
* Happywe'll be **

211
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:35,068
Water falling.
Not a waterfall.

212
00:16:43,015 --> 00:16:45,142
An angel ofstone.

213
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:20,134
(Knock On Door)

214
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:23,238
It's Mulder.

215
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,880
I just heard that Liz Hawley's family
made a positive l.D.

216
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:32,947
on the charm
you found at the warehouse.

217
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:35,425
The police are searching
that place inch by inch

218
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:38,054
but they haven't been able
to find anything yet.

219
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:43,161
I expected to find you
at the crime scene.

220
00:18:43,235 --> 00:18:45,430
Did Boggs confess?

221
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:50,567
No. No. It was five hours
of Boggs' channeling.

222
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:53,976
After three hours I asked him
to summon up the soul ofJimi Hendrix

223
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:57,072
and requested
"All Along The Watchtower."

224
00:18:57,183 --> 00:19:01,620
You know, the guy's been dead 20 years
but he still hasn't lost his edge.

225
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:04,121
I lied to the police
about how I found the warehouse.

226
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:09,221
I didn't notice
any suspicious activities.

227
00:19:09,295 --> 00:19:11,229
Then, how did you find it?

228
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:14,460
It was where Boggs
said it would be.

229
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:17,866
- Scully, I told you about Boggs.
- I didn't go looking for it.

230
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:21,566
I came across an area that
had landmarks he spoke of--

231
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,574
That's exactly
what Boggs wanted.

232
00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:28,079
He could have been setting you up.
You could be dead right now.

233
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:32,106
Why did you feel you had to lie
on your police report?

234
00:19:32,184 --> 00:19:35,153
I thought it would be
a better explanation

235
00:19:35,254 --> 00:19:37,449
under the circumstances.

236
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:39,616
No. You didn't want
to go on record

237
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:41,751
admitting thatyou
believed in Boggs.

238
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:44,625
The Bureau would expect something
like that from Spooky Mulder,

239
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:47,021
but not Dana Scully.

240
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:52,003
I thought
thatyou would be pleased

241
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:55,507
that I'd opened myself
to extreme possibilities.

242
00:19:55,574 --> 00:19:57,405
Why now?

243
00:19:57,476 --> 00:19:59,637
After all we've seen, why Boggs?

244
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:08,720
Does this have to do
with your father?

245
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,456
He said that he didn't approve
ofyou becoming an FBI agent.

246
00:20:13,526 --> 00:20:16,256
Ifbeing on thejob now
makes you feel guilty

247
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:20,458
or uncomfortable or uneasy
I thinkyou should back away.

248
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:23,629
Because ifit's clouding
yourjudgment

249
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:25,795
you're putting yourself
in danger.

250
00:20:26,972 --> 00:20:28,633
I love thisjob.

251
00:20:28,707 --> 00:20:30,436
You loveyour father.

252
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,505
Dana...

253
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,909
open yourselfup
to extreme possibilities

254
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:42,044
onlywhen
they're the truth.

255
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:45,885
That goes for Luther Boggs
and your father.

256
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:52,555
As for Luther Boggs

257
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:55,657
he's the greatest oflies.

258
00:20:55,734 --> 00:20:58,669
I know he's working
with someone on the outside

259
00:20:58,737 --> 00:21:01,399
and they planted that evidence.

260
00:21:01,473 --> 00:21:04,033
We have to be very careful
about plotting our next move

261
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:07,169
because he's planned
five steps ahead.

262
00:21:07,246 --> 00:21:10,272
The only advantage
we have is time.

263
00:21:16,922 --> 00:21:19,322
Scully, look at this.

264
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:23,624
That's incredible.
They found them?

265
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:26,221
That's exactly
what I want Boggs to think.

266
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:28,960
Why didn't the police
notify us?

267
00:21:29,034 --> 00:21:31,161
They haven't been found.
The article is bogus.

268
00:21:31,236 --> 00:21:32,931
The Carolinian
made this up for us.

269
00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:34,734
Only six people
know about it.

270
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:38,334
Today Boggs gets
his weekly phone privileges.

271
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,072
Hopefully, he'll call his accomplice
to find out what happened.

272
00:21:55,294 --> 00:21:57,854
Phone privilege is in two hours.

273
00:22:18,951 --> 00:22:21,545
(Boggs Dialing)

274
00:22:21,654 --> 00:22:24,020
Go.

275
00:22:27,926 --> 00:22:30,053
(Phone Rings)

276
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:32,097
Turn offthat phone.

277
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:33,858
- (Ringing)
- Turn it off.

278
00:22:33,966 --> 00:22:37,299
Mulder, it's you.

279
00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:39,200
(Ringing)

280
00:22:42,775 --> 00:22:45,642
- Mulder.
- How comeyou don't believe me?

281
00:22:46,745 --> 00:22:49,009
Agent Scully does.

282
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:51,709
She believes me.

283
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:54,651
Agent Scully believes
what we all believe--

284
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,779
thatyou have the kids.

285
00:22:56,855 --> 00:22:58,982
Now, where are they?

286
00:23:05,497 --> 00:23:08,227
Mulder, even ifhe is
setting us up

287
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,927
we have to follow,
because in three days--

288
00:23:11,036 --> 00:23:13,561
Liz Hawley andJim Summers
will be dead.

289
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:15,902
Then a day later,
our only connection to the case

290
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:19,410
will be pulling up a chair
at the gas chamber.

291
00:23:19,478 --> 00:23:21,742
We have to deal.

292
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:26,643
(Breathing Heavily)

293
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:30,519
The kidnapper is aroused
by the prospect ofbecoming a killer.

294
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:32,853
What's the name?

295
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:36,724
Can't see--
Male--

296
00:23:36,795 --> 00:23:39,525
Describe him.

297
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:41,792
Small...

298
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,892
thin...

299
00:23:45,003 --> 00:23:48,268
Iate twenties...

300
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,935
skull...
human skull...

301
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,875
silver gray.

302
00:23:53,946 --> 00:23:55,607
His eyes...

303
00:23:55,681 --> 00:23:58,241
cold... very cold...

304
00:23:58,317 --> 00:24:02,117
staring at Elizabeth.

305
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:05,652
God, he's got the wire.

306
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:07,123
No.

307
00:24:07,192 --> 00:24:09,820
Please... no.

308
00:24:16,034 --> 00:24:17,763
Where is he?

309
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:22,838
He's over...

310
00:24:22,908 --> 00:24:24,808
by the window...

311
00:24:24,877 --> 00:24:27,175
holding back his...

312
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:30,340
holding back his thoughts
ofkilling us...

313
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:35,019
waiting.

314
00:24:36,455 --> 00:24:39,424
There's a small boathouse
on LakeJordan.

315
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:41,425
You got that?

316
00:24:45,564 --> 00:24:47,657
Mulder.

317
00:24:47,766 --> 00:24:51,497
Don't go near
the white cross.

318
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,937
We seeyou down...

319
00:24:55,007 --> 00:24:59,671
and your blood
spills on the white cross.

320
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:09,115
(Muffed Cries)

321
00:25:30,642 --> 00:25:33,236
Sweep the docks!

322
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:56,794
- Federal agent!
- (Gunshot)

323
00:25:56,902 --> 00:25:58,369
Mulder!

324
00:26:07,012 --> 00:26:10,209
We need an ambulance!
Officer down!

325
00:26:35,274 --> 00:26:37,367
What do we got?

326
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:39,569
It's a through-and-through,
upper femur.

327
00:26:39,645 --> 00:26:41,237
Can't palpate
a radial pulse.

328
00:26:41,346 --> 00:26:44,577
Okay, I want a B.P.
Let's get him on the gurney.

329
00:26:44,683 --> 00:26:47,015
Nurse:
Blood pressure is 67 on palpation.

330
00:26:47,085 --> 00:26:49,053
Doctor:
Okay, tighten and screen him for six.

331
00:26:49,154 --> 00:26:51,418
I want two liters
ofsaline in now

332
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,890
and give him two units
ofO-neg after the typing.

333
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:56,951
Let's transfer now.

334
00:26:57,029 --> 00:26:59,122
Liz:
No.

335
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,563
No.

336
00:27:05,904 --> 00:27:07,838
No.

337
00:27:16,181 --> 00:27:20,277
Man:
LucasJackson Henry, 28.

338
00:27:20,385 --> 00:27:22,376
Did some time at Angola
in Louisiana

339
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:24,250
for sexual assault,
narcotics...

340
00:27:24,323 --> 00:27:26,348
nothing big, really.

341
00:27:26,425 --> 00:27:28,985
His personal history includes
being witness to an auto accident

342
00:27:29,061 --> 00:27:33,725
in which his high school sweetheart was
killed and his motherwas decapitated.

343
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,733
The seven-year anniversary

344
00:27:35,801 --> 00:27:38,269
ofthat accident
is in three days.

345
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:40,805
He's reliving it.

346
00:27:44,176 --> 00:27:46,667
That would explain the deadline.

347
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:50,112
The most important element
we found is there's suspicion

348
00:27:50,215 --> 00:27:52,581
that Luther Lee Boggs'
last five murders

349
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:54,744
were committed with a partner.

350
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:58,289
Now, the police in Durham say
they could never prove it in court

351
00:27:58,357 --> 00:28:01,224
but they know that partner
was Lucas Henry.

352
00:28:09,835 --> 00:28:11,928
You set us up.

353
00:28:12,004 --> 00:28:14,370
You're in on this
with Lucas Henry.

354
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:18,000
This was a trap for Mulder
because he helped putyou away.

355
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:20,636
Well, I came here to tell you

356
00:28:20,746 --> 00:28:25,683
that ifhe dies because ofwhat
you've done, four days from now

357
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:28,548
nobodywill stop me from being the one
that will throw the switch

358
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,215
and gas you out ofthis life
for good, you son ofa bitch!

359
00:28:34,326 --> 00:28:35,918
Dana.

360
00:28:35,994 --> 00:28:37,894
You're the one that believed me.

361
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:40,960
No.

362
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:44,059
No, I do not believeyou!

363
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:50,404
Ifyou don't believe me,
maybeyou'll believeyourself.

364
00:29:02,454 --> 00:29:07,187
There was that one time
when I was 1 4

365
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:12,492
and my parents had gone to bed
and I snuck downstairs alone.

366
00:29:12,564 --> 00:29:14,930
Got one ofmy mom's cigarettes

367
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,298
and went out
onto the porch in the dark.

368
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:21,703
I was so scared.

369
00:29:21,773 --> 00:29:23,707
My heart was beating.

370
00:29:23,775 --> 00:29:25,868
Theywould have killed me
ifthey knew.

371
00:29:27,646 --> 00:29:30,945
But I was so excited.

372
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:33,142
Not 'cause ofthe cigarette--

373
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:35,185
it was gross--

374
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:37,653
but because
I wasn't supposed to.

375
00:29:42,127 --> 00:29:45,255
That could be a moment
from any kid's life.

376
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,696
I know whatyou want

377
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:51,759
and I know who
you want to talk to.

378
00:29:51,837 --> 00:29:54,965
Why don'tyoujust go ahead
and ask me.

379
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:00,742
I'll believeyou...

380
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:05,442
ifyou let me talk to him.

381
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,680
Starbuck...

382
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:58,429
No, no, no!

383
00:30:58,503 --> 00:31:03,805
Nobody talks to anybody
until I get a deal.

384
00:31:06,511 --> 00:31:11,972
Don't underestimate
my fear ofdying

385
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:16,953
and don't downplay my terror
ofgoing back to that chair.

386
00:31:17,022 --> 00:31:20,082
I know my hell's
going to be

387
00:31:20,158 --> 00:31:24,185
to go back to that chair
over and over again for all oftime

388
00:31:24,262 --> 00:31:28,460
but in this life--
my one and only life--

389
00:31:28,533 --> 00:31:32,833
I don't everwant to go
back again-- ever!

390
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:38,642
The last time
I went to death's door

391
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,974
and looked inside

392
00:31:41,046 --> 00:31:43,378
I had never talked
to a minister before

393
00:31:43,448 --> 00:31:47,885
in my life ever
until that day

394
00:31:47,953 --> 00:31:53,892
and he said,
" He who doth not love

395
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:56,154
"remains in death.

396
00:31:56,261 --> 00:32:01,130
"And he who hates his brother
is a murderer

397
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:03,258
"and no murderer
has eternal life

398
00:32:03,335 --> 00:32:05,565
abiding in him."

399
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:11,542
My family, who I killed
after their last meal

400
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:16,138
was right there to watch me
over mine

401
00:32:16,214 --> 00:32:20,344
and their fear

402
00:32:20,418 --> 00:32:22,716
and their horror

403
00:32:22,787 --> 00:32:26,883
that I made them feel
when I killed them

404
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:29,927
was injected into me

405
00:32:29,995 --> 00:32:32,225
and their collective fear alone

406
00:32:32,297 --> 00:32:35,460
wasjust one taste ofhell.

407
00:32:39,437 --> 00:32:44,170
And I felt myself
leave my body.

408
00:32:44,242 --> 00:32:46,369
I thought they'd
already killed me.

409
00:32:46,444 --> 00:32:50,471
And I saw thousands

410
00:32:50,548 --> 00:32:54,780
ofsouls
rushing into my body.

411
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:04,622
It is a cold,
dark place, Scully.

412
00:33:06,364 --> 00:33:10,300
Mulder's looking in
on it right now.

413
00:33:10,368 --> 00:33:14,498
It may be a cold,
dark place foryou

414
00:33:14,572 --> 00:33:19,202
but it's not for Mulder
and it's not for my father.

415
00:33:19,277 --> 00:33:22,269
I'm sure he'd like
to tell you hisself

416
00:33:22,347 --> 00:33:27,011
but I'm not going to let him.

417
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:30,282
Nobody speaks
until you get me a deal.

418
00:33:32,023 --> 00:33:33,854
I don't believeyou.

419
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:36,426
Oh, well, there's plenty ofroom

420
00:33:36,528 --> 00:33:40,589
in that cold, dark place
for liars, Scully.

421
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:44,962
You go ahead and play it
likeyou need to

422
00:33:45,036 --> 00:33:47,402
but I knowyou believe me.

423
00:33:47,472 --> 00:33:51,499
But ifyou need to convince
ajudge I'm in on it with Lucas

424
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:54,977
go ahead,
'cause eitherway--

425
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:59,312
whether I'm running the show
with Lucas or I'm channeling--

426
00:33:59,384 --> 00:34:02,251
no information's coming
until I get a deal.

427
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,915
I got nothing to lose.

428
00:34:09,494 --> 00:34:11,428
Guard!

429
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:15,922
Ifl die

430
00:34:16,034 --> 00:34:20,664
that boy goes
to that cold, dark place.

431
00:34:47,232 --> 00:34:49,792
Man:
This Supreme Court

432
00:34:49,868 --> 00:34:52,837
will not make a deal
with a mass murderer.

433
00:34:52,904 --> 00:34:55,805
Especially one who I know
is orchestrating

434
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:58,843
a capital offense two days
before his capital punishment.

435
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,241
Yes, sir.

436
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:03,508
The only thing Boggs
will get from me is a timely death.

437
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:06,015
It's an overdue one at that.

438
00:35:12,323 --> 00:35:14,985
We're running out oftime.

439
00:35:15,093 --> 00:35:17,618
There's still no sign
of Lucas Henry

440
00:35:17,729 --> 00:35:20,994
orJim Summers.

441
00:35:21,065 --> 00:35:23,090
The Raleigh Police said--

442
00:35:23,168 --> 00:35:27,002
No matterwhat,
don't believe him.

443
00:35:27,071 --> 00:35:29,801
Boggs created this whole charade
to get back at me

444
00:35:29,874 --> 00:35:32,866
for putting him on death row.

445
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:38,445
You'd be the next best thing.

446
00:35:38,516 --> 00:35:42,509
Mulder, I never thought
I'd say this...

447
00:35:42,587 --> 00:35:45,283
but what ifthere's
another explanation?

448
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:50,384
Don't... deal with him.

449
00:35:50,495 --> 00:35:52,395
He could be trying
to claim you

450
00:35:52,464 --> 00:35:55,024
as his last victim.

451
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:14,245
All right, Mr. Boggs...

452
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:16,253
you gotyour deal.

453
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,923
Thankyou, ma'am.

454
00:36:25,997 --> 00:36:28,295
Thankyou.

455
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:34,003
All right, where are they?

456
00:36:36,341 --> 00:36:38,366
(Exhaling Loudly)

457
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,272
Uh... I...

458
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:48,478
uh...

459
00:36:48,553 --> 00:36:53,354
I see, like, uh...

460
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:56,621
uh, circles.

461
00:36:56,728 --> 00:36:58,252
Uh...

462
00:36:58,363 --> 00:37:02,459
I don't know, like... barrels.

463
00:37:02,534 --> 00:37:04,559
No. No, bigger.

464
00:37:04,636 --> 00:37:06,627
Like, uh...

465
00:37:06,704 --> 00:37:10,868
huge, uh...
vats, uh--

466
00:37:12,343 --> 00:37:14,277
Factory.

467
00:37:14,345 --> 00:37:16,711
Uh, condemned.

468
00:37:16,781 --> 00:37:19,716
The old,

469
00:37:19,784 --> 00:37:23,345
uh, Blue Devil Brewery

470
00:37:23,421 --> 00:37:25,855
up by Morrisville.

471
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:30,225
Oh, God, he's getting, uh...
he's getting ready.

472
00:37:30,295 --> 00:37:32,388
He-- He--

473
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,760
He's getting ready to, um...

474
00:37:34,832 --> 00:37:37,266
um--

475
00:37:37,335 --> 00:37:40,964
He's getting ready
to kill the d--

476
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:43,030
Whoo.

477
00:37:56,621 --> 00:37:58,612
Luther, ifyou really
were psychic--

478
00:37:58,723 --> 00:38:00,953
I would have known you lied.

479
00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:04,358
That there neverwas a deal.

480
00:38:04,429 --> 00:38:07,296
I knowyou tried.

481
00:38:13,605 --> 00:38:16,233
Scully.

482
00:38:16,307 --> 00:38:18,935
Avoid the devil.

483
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:22,070
Don't follow Henry to the devil.

484
00:38:22,146 --> 00:38:24,910
Leave that to me.

485
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:33,919
(Screaming)

486
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:40,429
(Groaning)

487
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:49,839
(Water Dripping)

488
00:39:04,856 --> 00:39:06,255
Agent:
Freeze!

489
00:39:06,357 --> 00:39:09,121
Federal agents.
We're armed!

490
00:39:10,228 --> 00:39:12,025
Dropyourweapon.

491
00:39:17,802 --> 00:39:19,497
(Gunshot)

492
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:37,549
(Heaving)

493
00:39:41,826 --> 00:39:43,760
Go!

494
00:39:44,796 --> 00:39:46,730
Ow!

495
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:49,062
(Grunting)

496
00:40:51,395 --> 00:40:53,590
You come to say good-bye?

497
00:40:56,234 --> 00:40:58,293
I believe...

498
00:41:01,072 --> 00:41:06,408
that ifyou had orchestrated
this kidnapping

499
00:41:06,477 --> 00:41:10,413
Lucas Henrywould have
been aware ofthe danger

500
00:41:10,515 --> 00:41:12,483
you warned me about.

501
00:41:14,085 --> 00:41:16,451
He neverwould have
crossed that bridge.

502
00:41:19,924 --> 00:41:24,588
Soyou saved
jim Summers' life.

503
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,525
Butyou saved mine as well.

504
00:41:44,515 --> 00:41:47,678
You come for some
unfinished business.

505
00:41:49,587 --> 00:41:51,521
You want
your father's message.

506
00:41:54,258 --> 00:41:56,055
Not now.

507
00:41:56,127 --> 00:41:58,527
Be there tonight.

508
00:41:58,596 --> 00:42:01,724
Mywitness.

509
00:42:01,799 --> 00:42:06,168
And when they got me
in that chair and they...

510
00:42:06,237 --> 00:42:08,762
open up that shield...

511
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:14,778
you getyour message.

512
00:43:11,702 --> 00:43:14,637
(Breathing Heavily)

513
00:43:22,947 --> 00:43:26,781
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy Name.

514
00:43:26,884 --> 00:43:30,820
Thy Kingdom come, Thywill be done
on Earth as it is in Heaven...

515
00:43:30,888 --> 00:43:33,686
Would you like
to make a statement?

516
00:43:33,758 --> 00:43:35,692
And forgive us
our trespasses

517
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,024
as we forgive those
that trespass against us.

518
00:43:38,095 --> 00:43:41,496
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

519
00:43:41,565 --> 00:43:46,002
ForThine is the Kingdom,
the power and the glory

520
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:48,732
forever and ever, amen.

521
00:44:01,352 --> 00:44:04,879
I was considering Boggs.

522
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:08,288
Ifhe knew that I was
your partner

523
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:11,522
he could have found out everything
he knew about me-- about my father.

524
00:44:11,595 --> 00:44:13,222
Scully--

525
00:44:13,297 --> 00:44:16,460
" Beyond the Sea" was playing
at my parents' wedding.

526
00:44:16,534 --> 00:44:20,595
Visions ofdeceased loved ones
are a common psychological phenomena.

527
00:44:20,671 --> 00:44:24,266
- Ifhe knew that my father--
- Dana...

528
00:44:24,342 --> 00:44:29,075
after all you've seen,
after all the evidence

529
00:44:29,146 --> 00:44:31,376
why can'tyou believe?

530
00:44:39,323 --> 00:44:41,587
I'm afraid.

531
00:44:43,894 --> 00:44:45,885
I'm afraid to believe.

532
00:44:47,164 --> 00:44:50,497
You couldn't face that fear?

533
00:44:50,568 --> 00:44:53,833
Even ifit meant never knowing
whatyour fatherwanted to tell you?

534
00:44:56,574 --> 00:44:58,735
But I do know.

535
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,778
How?

536
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:07,784
He was my father.
