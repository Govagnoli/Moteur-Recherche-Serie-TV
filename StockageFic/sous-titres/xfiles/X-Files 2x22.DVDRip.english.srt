Don't waste my time, Winston.
Both of us know I ain't got nobody.

22
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,510
Could be those Baptists from Annandale.
I hear they've been sending fruitcake.

23

Hey, Winston! You think this is funny?
What kind of crap you tryin' to pull here?

- When was he exposed?
- 18 hours ago.

00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,951
It incubated so quickly.

32
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,669
Where's the prison doc?
I wanna see the prison doc.

33
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,114
We're specialists, Mr Torrence.

34
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,555
What's wrong with me?

35
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,873
Five centimetres. They appear fairly uniform.

36
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,758
- Basal temperature?
- 103.5.

37
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,071
Oxygen saturation: 81 per cent.

38
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,155
- What's wrong with me?
- Try and relax, Mr Torrence.

39
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,229
We're here to help you.

40
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,199
Put the sheets in the cart.
Make sure and get all them pillows, too.

41
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,669
I'll be back in five minutes.

42
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,271
We'll be here.

43
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,393
See that? Like he couldn't
clear out of here fast enough.

44
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,554
- The whole cell block's empty.
- McGuire says they're full up at the infirmary.

45
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,393
- Bringing in more beds.
- Yeah, well...

46
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,313
...it's probably something going around.

47
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,630
- Maybe.
- What? You know somethin'?

48
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,156
I know those sheets
ain't going to the laundry.

49
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,153
McGuire says they're going
to some kind of incinerator.

50
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,593
But the laundry pick-up's still happening.

51
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,754
According to my briefing, the prisoners
escaped by hiding in a laundry cart.

52
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,274
The guards don't watch
enough prison movies.

53
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,510
And they're both serving life terms.

54
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,751
- Murder convictions.
- Everybody's here.

55
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,310
- I thought this was about escaped prisoners.
- <i>(Scully)</i> It is.

56
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,789
Then who are the men in the funny suits?

57
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,468
I don't know.
It looks like some kind of decon situation.

58
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,639
FBI running out of
crooked politicians to sting?

59
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,359
<i>(Mulder)</i> Excuse me?

60
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,351
Mulder and, uh, Scully?

61
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,433
That's right. We have orders to work with
the federal marshals on this manhunt.

62
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,592
Either of you two ever run
an escaped-convict operation?

63
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,476
No.

64
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,632
Then you'd be a big help
if you just try to stay out of the way.

65
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,589
Well, we'd be happy to, as soon as
we can talk to someone who's in charge.

66
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,671
- I'm in charge.
- Apparently not.

67
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,354
Or you'd know why
our involvement was requested.

68
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,079
We don't know why we're here.
If we saw the warden...

69
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,072
No one's here. It's been taken over
by the National Guard.

70
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,515
- They've closed off most of the facility.
- Why?

71
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,433
I don't know. A federal marshal's
business isn't in here.

72
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,717
It's out there trying
to catch those two convicts.

73
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,957
- Where did this case originate, Scully?
- It came out of Skinner's office.

74
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,998
- Did he say why he gave it to us?
- No. Why?

75
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,516
Well, this isn't the type of thing
the FBI normally gets called in on.

76
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,398
I got a feeling we're not
being told the entire story.

77
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,710
I've got the same feeling, Mulder.

78
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,555
- You think you can find out what's going on?
- I can try.

79
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,996
- Where are you going?
- To see if I can get in the way.

80
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,395
Hey, you girls go with Mom.

81
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,471

86
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,873

- Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
- Hey! Hey!

89
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,629
- I'm sorry. This is a restricted area.
- Who are you?

90
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,109
- Dr Osborne.
- Are you the prison doctor?

91
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,078
- No.
- Who do you work for?

92
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,037
The CDC.

93
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,716
You work for the Centers for Disease Control.
What are you doing here?

94
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,828
Sir? I'm a medical doctor.
I wanna know what's going on here.

95
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,629
If you don't let me in, a lot of people
in Washington are gonna find out...

96
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,315
...that you're conducting
a secret quarantine in here.

97
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,192
- I'm under strict orders.
- So am I.

98
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,832
There is a flu-like illness
spreading amongst the prisoners.

99
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,388
- How many people are infected?
- 14 men so far.

100
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,233
- Any deaths?
- 10... of the 14.

101
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,754
What are the chances
the men who escaped are infected?

102
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,995
They just took off. Can you believe that?

103
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,155
- Mulder.
- Mulder, it's me.

104
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,629
I'm starting to get a picture
of what's going on.

105
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,598
- What did you find?
- There's a deadly contagion...

106
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,116
...sweeping the lockdown population.
- <i>Deadly?</i>

107
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,668
<i>How deadly?</i>

108
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,880
Well, from what I've seen so far...
36 hours after infection deadly.

109
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,313
Is there a chance any of
the escaped men were infected?

110
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,755
The exact nature of this thing is unclear.

111
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,833
<i>So is their exposure to it</i>
<i>and any danger they might pose.</i>

112
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,276
- I'd say these guys are a danger in <i>any</i> event.
- <i>(man)</i> Let's get him out.

113
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,715
Call me as soon as you know anything.

114
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,832
I don't care who you are.
I want you out of here right now.

115
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,469
- Not until I get answers.
- You're in violation of federal statutes.

116
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,438
- I'm a federal agent, sir.
- Who were you on the phone to?

117
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,592
My partner. He needs to know
if the escaped men are infected.

118
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,477
That information is unavailable.

119
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,632
Then I wanna see charts
and I want access to the infirmary.

120
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,109

Hey, man...

134
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,751
You can't be down here.

135
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,391
I need to know what they're dying from. You
said this was some kind of a flu-like illness.

136
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,994
- What are these?
- The bodies should not be exposed.

137
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,551
Do all of the victims have these boils?
You're burning the bodies. Why?

138
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,631
Dr Osborne, wait!

139
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,790
Freeze! Hands in the air! Freeze!

140
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,274

He's alive!

144
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,709
Attendant is Angelo Garza. He took
a crack to the head, but he's talking.

145
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,358
Lucky they didn't kill him.

146
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,113
Kid's got a lot of hair.
Probably absorbed the blow.

147
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,988
He found one of the men in pain on
the bathroom floor with a boil on his face.

148
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,470
There's a contagion at the prison.
These men could be infected.

149
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,074
Get on the horn.
See what anybody knows about that.

150
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,755
They took the kid's keys and got in the safe.
They got money, a car...

151
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,479
...possibly a firearm,
and they got a big head start.

152
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,236
- Any idea where they're headed?
- 23 possible roads and thoroughfares.

153
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,678
- Either of them got a girlfriend?
- Those records are locked up in the prison.

154
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:03,198
- For now, this is <i>Smokey and the Bandit.</i>
- If they did, they probably tried to call them.

155
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,475
Did you think of that?

156
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,714
<i>This is the operator. How may I help you?</i>

00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,957

168
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,595
- Hey, did you order this?
- No.

169
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,752
- Then who the hell did?
- I don't know. There was a call made...

170
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,436
...from that booth two hours ago. I got an
address and number for Dinwiddie County.

171
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,591
<i>(car horn)</i>

172
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,871
Wait here, sweetie. I'll be right back.

173
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,873
- I thought you were BS-ing me.
- I'm gone, sweet thing.

174
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,598
- They ain't never takin' me back.
- I ain't gonna let them.

175
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,956
- <i>(child)</i> Mommy! Mommy!
- I'm coming, sweetie.

176
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,554
Daddy's home. Come on.

177
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,029
- I got somebody with me.
- What?

178
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,191
<i>(groans)</i>

179
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,594
What's wrong with him?

180
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,433
I don't know. He's out of it.

181
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,069
- Oh, hell. He's burning up.
- We gotta get him in the house.

182
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,198
<i>(man) Can I help you?</i>

183
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,716
Yes. I'm trying to trace the origin
of a package that was sent to...

184
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,998
...a Robert Torrence at the Cumberland State
Correctional Facility in Virginia.

185
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:33,189
- <i>Do you have the package ID number?</i>
- Yeah, the package ID number is DDP112148.

186
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,031
Sure, I'll hold.

187
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,319
<i>Are you there?</i>
<i>It was sent from Wichita, Kansas.</i>

188
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,837
The package was sent from Wichita, Kansas?
Did you record the name of the sender?

189
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,674
<i>It says here it was sent</i>
<i>from Pinck Pharmaceuticals.</i>

190
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,435
- Could you check that again, please?
- <i>Sure.</i>

191
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,478
- <i>Yes, ma'am. That's what it says.</i>
- Thank you.

192
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,551
<i>(phone rings)</i>

193
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,229
Yeah?

194
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,118
What do you know about
Pinck Pharmaceuticals?

195
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,591
It's one of, if not the biggest,
manufacturer of drugs in America. Why?

196
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,432
They sent a package to a prisoner who may
have been the first victim of the contagion.

197
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,990
- Any idea what was in the package?
- <i>No. It's empty.</i>

198
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:29,194
From the description, one prisoner had
a large, purplish inflammation on his face.

199
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,353
That sounds like what I'm finding
on all the victims in here.

200
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,911
- Do you know what that means, Mulder?
- It could spread. I need to know more.

201
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,389
- <i>How it's transmitted.</i>
- I'm on it.

202
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,349
Gotta go. Gotta keep movin'.

203
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,671
Paul! Paul, he's awake.

204
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,191
Paul, come here!

205
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,716
You gotta help me. I'm... I'm burning up here.

206
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,791
Please.

207
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,357
Paul!

208
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,632
Paul! Paul!

209
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,038
- Paul!
- <i>(shouting)</i>

210
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,352
We got one prisoner dead in the bedroom.
The other one's gone.

211
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,398
<i>(officer)</i> Charlie, why don't you get the boy?

212
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,394
- Come with me.
- Why? What's going on?

213
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,869
Just come with me.

214
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,229
What the hell is going on?

215
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,789
I've been infected.

216
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,310
They're not letting me out.
The entire prison's been quarantined.

217
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,518
- By who? The CDC?
- The CDC has nothing to do with this.

218
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,835
It's the company. They're behind everything.

219
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,710
Pinck Pharmaceuticals.
You work for Pinck Pharmaceuticals?

220
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,871
How did this happen?

221
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,991
We finance exploration of
new species from the rainforest...

222
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,719
...with potential drug applications.

223
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,554
Three months ago, a field entomologist
disappeared in Costa Rica.

224
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,279
- Disappeared how?
- We're not sure.

225
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,954
He just sent us some samples of an insect.

226
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,919
Like this? I found this buried
in one of the dead prisoners.

227
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,029
<i>Faciphaga emasculata.</i>

228
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,115
We were interested in it because
of a dilating enzyme it secretes.

229
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,475
Is this what caused the outbreak?

230
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,551
No. No, not precisely.

231
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,869
<i>F. Emasculata</i> is a parasitoid -
a bug that carries a parasite.

232
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,556
In this case, a deadly parasite
that attacks the immune system.

233
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,110
The pustules are part of
the natural reproductive cycle.

234
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,875
They're full of the larvae that
you see there on the scope.

235
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,116
So the contagion only spreads
when the pustules erupt.

236
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,193
And the larvae that are expelled
burrow into the new host.

237
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:13,400
Agent Scully... you were there
when the pustule erupted on me.

238
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,433
Which means you may also be infected.

239
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,672
<i>(knocking)</i>

240
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,830
Come in.

241
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,832
- Thank you for seeing me at this late hour.
- What is it?

242
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,959
This case we've been assigned. I believe
we've been misled. Possibly deceived.

243
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,953
- Deceived? By whom?
- Whoever originated the case.

244
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,838
<i>(man)</i> What is the accusation, Agent Mulder?

245
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,999
That we were sent on this manhunt without
knowledge of the existence of the contagion.

246
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,677
- What is the exact nature of the contagion?
- It's deadly. It kills within 36 hours.

247
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,558
One escaped convict was infected -
he's dead now.

248
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,154
The other man may be infected
and he's on the loose.

249
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,516
Does anyone know whether
it's a virus or a bacteria?

250
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,593
We know that over a dozen men have died
from it. It appears to be highly contagious.

251
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,717
- Then you don't know much.
- Why weren't we told the truth?

252
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,997
We didn't know the truth. What we knew
would have slowed you down.

253
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,470
Innocent people could be infected.
You could have prevented that.

254
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:30,829
How? In 1988 there was an outbreak
of haemorrhagic fever in Sacramento.

255
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,118
The truth would have caused panic.
Panic would have cost lives.

256
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,751
- We controlled it by controlling information.
- You can't protect the public by lying.

257
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,910
It's done every day.

258
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,991
I won't be a party to it.

259
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,188
How about you?

260
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,949
You're a party to it already.

261
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,919
How many people are being infected
while you stand here not doing yourjob?

262
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,755
Ten? Twenty?
What's the truth, Agent Mulder?

263
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,551
<i>(phone rings)</i>

264
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,119
- Mulder.
- Mulder, they're enforcing a full quarantine.

265
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,916
What?

266
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,117
One of the epidemiologists
who claimed to be with the CDC...

267
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,430
...told me that this was no accident.

268
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,717
Pinck Pharmaceutical is here
trying to clean it up quietly.

269
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,349
- And the government would have to know.
- Do you have proof of that?

270
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,195
Why else would the National Guard be here?
They're protecting Pinck Pharmaceutical.

271
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,671
I need to know how this happened. Document
everything you can get your hands on.

272
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,558
- <i>People have to know about the cover-up.</i>
- The public?

273
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,838
- It's a public-health crisis.
- We can't leak this. Not until we know more.

274
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,117
The fugitive you're looking for
might not even be infected.

275
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,270
- What if he is?
- If this gets out...

276
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,229
...the panic is gonna spread faster than
the contagion. We can't let this be known.

277
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,914
What if someone dies
because we withheld what we knew?

278
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,072
What if someone dies because we didn't?

279
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,392
<i>There'll be a time for the truth,</i>
<i>Mulder, but this isn't it.</i>

280
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,189
Are you OK in there, Scully?

281
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,118
Yeah. I'm OK. All I want you to
worry about is capturing that fugitive.

282
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,989
<i>Take care of yourself, Mulder.</i>

283
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,714
If you're not infected,
you should leave immediately.

284
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,791
And if I am?

285
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,839
The parasite is undetectable
in the bloodstream.

286
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,277
This is the only way to test
whether or not you've been infected.

287
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,550
These uninfected insects act as incubators.

288
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,914
Now the insect's bite won't infect you.

289
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,391
The contagion can only be contracted
through exposure to the larvae.

290
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,591
How long will this take?

291
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,710
Thirty minutes. Then another two hours...

292
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,395
...before the parasite reproduces
enough for us to see it.

293
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,199
Elizabeth? My name is Fox Mulder.
I'm with the FBI.

294
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,634
- Where did Paul go, Elizabeth?
- I don't know.

295
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,471
I think you do know.

296
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,958
And I think you know why you're in here.

297
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,638
- How are you feeling?
- I'm fine.

298
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:31,750
Steve felt fine too.
It didn't take long for that to change.

299
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,037
- You're just tryin' to scare me.
- You should be scared.

300
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,270
- If I were you, I'd be scared.
- You're lyin'!

301
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,433
Paul is the one who was lying. And if
he's infected, a lot of people are gonna die.

302
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:47,356
If that's true, how come it's not on TV?
How come they're not tellin' everybody?

303
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,955
- That's not my decision.
- Well, whose decision is it?

304
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,555
You knew about it
and you didn't say anything.

305
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,313
Why should I tell the truth if you won't?

306
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,598
Elizabeth, Paul is out there somewhere.
I have to find him.

307
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,271
Now you can help me...

308
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,351
...or not.

309
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,352
Ten o'clock bus to Toronto.
She was supposed to be with him.

310
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,908
That bus depot's over a half-hour from here.

311
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,436
- Get on to the local PD.
- They don't know what they're dealing with.

312
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,718
If he's infected, he could spread it.
What we need now is control.

313
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,191
<i>(coughing)</i>

314
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,756
Toronto, one way?

315
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,159
Yes.

316
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,197
Now... once we harvest
the blood from the insect...

317
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,959
The toxins... they're moving into my brain
just like it did on the prisoners.

318
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,713
I don't have much longer.

319
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,870
I need you to help me.

320
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,951
What do you want me to do?

321
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,550
Go on.

322
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,029
You have to complete the test.

323
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,076
Why did you confide in me?

324
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,355
It's not a secret I feel like taking to the grave.

325
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,115
People have a right to know
the danger we put them in.

326
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:54,030
If your test comes back negative...
<i>you</i> have to tell them.

327
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,153
How can I prove it?

328
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,834
I don't know.

329
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,390
But if you don't, it'll just happen again.

330
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:12,439
Don't believe for a second
that this is an isolated incident.

331
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,830
<i>(Tannoy) Your attention, please.</i>
<i>Bus number 953...</i>

332
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,474
- Wait a second.
- I don't wanna miss the bus.

333
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,278
You see that? They're still loading
the luggage. You're not missing anything.

334
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,989
You have enough time to give
your mother a kiss goodbye.

335
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,471
Ticket.

336
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,394
Be careful. Say hi to Uncle Jay.

337
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,751
Hey!

338
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,311
What's the time?

339
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,111
Twenty to ten.

340
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,036
- What are you doing?
- This material will be destroyed...

341
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,192
...according to standard CDC procedure.

342
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,033
You don't work for the CDC.

343
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,111
Where's Dr Osborne?

344
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,750
- He told me what happened here.
- What happened here was unavoidable.

345
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:53,152
- We'll leave that up to others to decide.
- Dr Osborne is dead.

346
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,630
No one in this room
will corroborate your story.

347
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,951
Just be glad this thing is under control.

348
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,353
<i>(Tannoy) Would the driver of bus number 25</i>
<i>to Pittsburgh come to the dispatch office?</i>

349
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:43,433
<i>Your attention, please.</i>
<i>Announcing the arrival of bus number 126...</i>

350
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,275
- He's here. He bought a ticket to Toronto.
- Son of a bitch.

351
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,749
And he's infected.

352
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,551
<i>(phone rings)</i>

353
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,511
- Mulder.
- Mulder...

354
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,398
...I think everything here is under control.

355
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,755
- You OK, Scully?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

356
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,516
- Have you found the second prisoner?
- <i>Yeah. He's headed to Toronto.</i>

357
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,879
He's alive? Mulder, listen to me.
Everything here has been destroyed.

358
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,270
<i>Any evidence whatsoever</i>
<i>of a cover-up has been incinerated.</i>

359
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,239
<i>That prisoner is the last man who could</i>
<i>possibly connect the conspirators.</i>

360
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,278
- He's infected. He's gonna die.
- If you want the truth...

361
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,158
...he's gonna have to make a statement.

362
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,791
- Hold your men back. I'm getting on the bus.
- We've got the situation controlled.

363
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,873
- That bus isn't going anywhere.
- The prisoner sees a uniform, he could panic.

364
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,349
He panics, and innocent people die.

365
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,032
- What you do wanna do?
- I take the seat behind the prisoner.

366
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,954
I put my gun to his head.
I make an announcement to clear the bus.

367
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,711
<i>(driver)</i> Thank you.

368
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,958
Can you take your seat, sir?

369
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,476
- There's supposed to be a man on the bus.
- I've got a schedule to keep.

370
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,633
Now please, take your seat,
or I'm gonna have to ask you to get off.

371
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,232
Take the key out of the ignition
and turn around slowly.

372
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,198
- What is this?
- I'm with the FBI.

373
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,750
I need to know if this man
has boarded the bus.

374
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,631
Yeah.

375
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,950
That's him, right back there.

376
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,551
Federal agent! Drop your weapon!

377
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,791
Plan A has gone to hell. Get ready.

378
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,711
- Let the boy go!
- Move the damn bus!

379
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,920
You got over two dozen US marshals out
there, Paul. How far are you gonna get?

380
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,271
I'm dying, ain't I?

381
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,114
The question is, how many people
are you gonna take with you?

382
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,397
- What is this thing?
- You were infected in prison.

383
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,758
- It's what Bobby Torrence had.
- And your girlfriend, Elizabeth.

384
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,434
And possibly your son.

385
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,318
How many more people
do you want to expose?

386
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,633
It came from that package
in Bobby's cell, didn't it?

387
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,109
You saw a package?

388
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,669
What the hell was it?

389
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,189
All right, everybody off the bus.

390
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,710
Just keep going. Just go. Just go.

391
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,031
Keep moving.

392
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,631
All right, come on out. It's OK.

393
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,278
Come on, just slide out. I'm here for you.

394
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,351
That's it. Come on.

395
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,471
All right.

396
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,237
All right, Paul. What was in that package?

397
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:01,509
What was in that package? A pharmaceutical
company was using you as a guinea pig.

398
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:06,037
If you tell me what was in that package,
I'll make sure they don't get away with it.

399
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,317
Come on, Paul. You remember. Tell me!

400
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,830
<i>(man)</i> Get him off the bus.
Get him outta there.

401
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,354
You have to get off. Let's go.

402
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,795
Get off.

403
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,673
Robert Torrence was patient zero -
the first prisoner to contract the disease.

404
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,958
Before going to the infirmary, he received
a package from Pinck Pharmaceuticals.

405
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,112
They orchestrated this
to circumvent years of FDA trials...

406
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,431
...to get their drug on the market.
- Why are you telling me this?

407
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,432
I wanted you to hear from me
before you read it in the papers.

408
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,637
I'd seriously reconsider
bringing this to the media.

409
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,234
The public should know,
so it doesn't happen again.

410
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,108
You're gonna prove this conspiracy
with an empty package and a dead insect?

411
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,795
- Leave it alone. The epidemic was contained.
- 18 people are dead.

412
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,795
And if you're helping them cover the truth,
you're just as guilty as they are.

413
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,832
You really have no idea
who you're dealing with, do you?

414
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,639
I <i>thought</i> I was dealing with you.

415
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,869
<i>(knocking)</i>

416
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,035
- We can't prove a thing. They've made sure.
- What are you talking about?

417
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:27,749
The Costa Rican government faxed me
the report on the missing scientist.

418
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,877
His name was Robert Torrence,
the same as our prisoner.

419
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,590
It was their fail-safe in case it came to this.
They could blame it on a simple postal error.

420
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,671
A mistake.

421
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,271
Hmm.

422
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,550
That's why we were given this assignment,
right? They knew all along.

423
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:52,598
So that even if we succeeded in finding
the truth, we'd be discredited as part of it.

424
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,671
Am I right?

425
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,195
- Am I right?!
- You never had a chance, Agent Mulder.

426
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,955
- For every step you take, they're three ahead.
- Where do you stand?

427
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,430
I stand right on the line
that you keep crossing.

428
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,871
Come on, let's go.

429
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,351
Agent Mulder.

430
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,238
I'm saying this as a friend.

431
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,550
Watch your back.

432
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,835
This is just the beginning.
