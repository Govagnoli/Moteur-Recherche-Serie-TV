1
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,664
Holy Ghost, come to me.

2
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,404
Praise God. Praise God.
Move up on me, Holy Ghost.

3
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:51,516
Praise God.
This here sinner repents.

4
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:53,677
Holy Ghost, move up on me.

5
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:56,620
Protect me and mine
with your quickening power.

6
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,640
Holy Ghost, come to me.

7
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,319
Aah!

8
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,564
Oh, help me, Jesus!

9
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,234
Oh, help me, Jesus!
Help me, Jesus!

10
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,184
Not as far as you know.

11
00:03:15,394 --> 00:03:17,328
Right.

12
00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:19,489
Not this time of year.

13
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:23,835
All right. Thank you, Doctor. Good-bye.

14
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,633
Snakes.

15
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:30,800
Lots and lots of snakes.

16
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:33,310
Very pissed-off ones,
from the look of it.

17
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:40,376
It's the former Mr. Jared Chirp
of McMinn County, Tennessee.

18
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:43,751
- Oh, my God.
- 116 separate bite marks.

19
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:45,915
Judging from the wound measurements,

20
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:49,586
there were 50 different snakes involved,
mostly copperheads and rattlers.

21
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:52,153
But it says here that he
was found dead in his car.

22
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:55,928
Yeah, with a pistol in his hand.
He fired six shots into the floorboards,

23
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:58,731
into the passenger seat,
even into his own right kneecap.

24
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:01,136
The windows were shut
and the doors were locked.

25
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:03,903
But what happened
to all the snakes?

26
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:07,605
No one seems to know that.
There was not a scale found.

27
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,707
I just got off the phone with
a herpetologist at the Smithsonian,
and he's stumped,

28
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:15,345
especially because these rattlesnakes
tend to hibernate in winter.

29
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,357
So you think that
Mr. Chirp was murdered.

30
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,622
It certainly would appear that way,
but the question is how.

31
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:25,926
There's no physical evidence at all...
no tire tracks, no footprints.

32
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:29,593
I can't see how anyone
could've accomplished this.
Then you gotta ask yourself why.

33
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:32,262
Why would anybody use poisonous snakes
as a murder weapon?

34
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:36,832
Maybe it's symbolic. I mean, serpents
and religion have gone hand in hand.

35
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:40,276
They've represented
the temptation of Eve, original sin.

36
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,678
They've been feared and hated
throughout history,

37
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:47,344
as they've been thought to
embody Satan... to serve evil itself.

38
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:50,354
Maybe these ones actually do.

39
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:53,823
These particular serpents
actually were serving evil?

40
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:57,988
Are you gonna type that
on our travel request?

41
00:04:58,063 --> 00:04:59,997
No.

42
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:03,000
But at the very least this case
does seem to center around religion,

43
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:05,502
and you're not the only one
to think that, by the way.

44
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:28,884
Jared is in a better
place now, Gracie.

45
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,895
He's at peace.

46
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:45,372
You know Reverend Mackey's
right, honey.

47
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:47,537
He is in a better place.

48
00:05:58,957 --> 00:06:01,187
Reverend Samuel Mackey?

49
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,088
My name is Fox Mulder.
This is Dana Scully.

50
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,530
We're with the F.B.I.
May we speak with you, sir?

51
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:11,167
Come on, Gracie.
Let's get you home.

52
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,946
We apologize for our timing.
We'd like to ask you a few
questions aboutJared Chirp.

53
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:25,040
I've already spoken
to the sheriff about it,

54
00:06:25,117 --> 00:06:29,076
though I'm not sure that
that was a good idea.

55
00:06:29,154 --> 00:06:32,089
Specifically, you had suspicions
about the manner in which he died?

56
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:39,495
I should be the last one to
point a finger or say a harsh word.

57
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,432
Our church is founded on
acceptance and tolerance...

58
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:45,834
- Of all people, all beliefs.
- But?

59
00:06:47,973 --> 00:06:52,672
BeforeJared joined us,
he belonged to a fundamentalist
congregation outside of town,

60
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,612
the Church of God
with Signs & Wonders.

61
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,308
It practices snake handling.

62
00:06:57,383 --> 00:07:00,978
As a sign of faith, worshippers
handle deadly snakes or drink poison.

63
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:06,491
They believe that the Holy Spirit
protects the righteous.

64
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:10,255
Jared grew up in that church,
but it is very difficult...

65
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,423
to walk away from a belief system
that one is raised in.

66
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:15,660
It takes great courage.

67
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:17,827
Why did he walk away?

68
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:21,839
He and Gracie, his girlfriend,
left it together.

69
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:27,436
They found that a rigid interpretation
of the Bible was not for them,

70
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:32,382
especially when it involves risking
life and limb in the act of worship.

71
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,885
But, again,
it is not for me to judge.

72
00:07:34,953 --> 00:07:39,788
I will say, however,
that both Jared and Gracie...

73
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:43,191
were persecuted by the members
of their former church.

74
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,558
All this animus...

75
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,125
stems from their church leader,
Enoch O'Connor.

76
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:53,535
Animus enough
to motivate a murder?

77
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:25,927
Snake handling.
We didn't learn that in catechism class.

78
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:29,440
That's funny, I knew a couple Catholic
schoolgirls who were expert at it.

79
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:39,116
Enoch O'Connor?

80
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:41,118
Federal agents.

81
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,260
Where's the light switch?

82
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,819
The nearest one?
Probably ten miles from here.

83
00:08:51,897 --> 00:08:53,831
Yeah.

84
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,369
All right.

85
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,923
Rattlesnakes and medieval visions
of damnation.

86
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,789
I, for one, feel
a whole lot closer to God.

87
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,727
I don't know, Scully.
When you get right down to it,

88
00:09:24,796 --> 00:09:27,731
is snake handling
any harder to buy into than...

89
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,030
communion wafers
or transubstantiation...

90
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,333
Or believing in flying saucers,
for that matter.

91
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:37,739
I'm just saying that your faith
and O'Connor's seem...

92
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:39,902
to be based
on the same book.

93
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,951
Uh-oh, Scully. What do you think
O'Connor keeps in here?

94
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:58,019
Something slithery?

95
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:05,599
- It's all right. It's empty.
- Why is it empty?

96
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,222
By what right are you here?

97
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:37,135
Reverend Enoch O'Connor,
we're federal agents.

98
00:10:37,202 --> 00:10:39,670
We're, uh, with the F.B.I.

99
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:43,308
Reverend, do something
about these snakes, please.

100
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:47,502
You got nothing to fear
if you're righteous people.

101
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:49,808
Just in case we're not, we could use
a little righteous help here.

102
00:10:54,952 --> 00:10:57,079
What do you want?

103
00:10:57,155 --> 00:11:02,183
We're here to ask you questions
about a former member of
your church... Jared Chirp.

104
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,663
That boy strayed from the path
and was lost to the Dark One.

105
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:08,824
I'm sorry for his soul.

106
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,199
- There ain't much else to say.
- He died from multiple snake bites.

107
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,103
We thought maybe you'd have
a special insight into that.

108
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:19,276
I do.

109
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:25,615
- It was a test.
- Test? What do you mean?

110
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:30,620
A test of faith.
A test of righteousness.

111
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:37,059
When the devil aims to test you,
you best be ready.

112
00:11:37,128 --> 00:11:40,461
And you sure better know
which side you're on.

113
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:43,898
You speaking about the devil's test
or your test?

114
00:11:43,968 --> 00:11:48,234
I don't think you people
realize which side you're on.

115
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:52,609
I do.

116
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:55,871
You can leave now.

117
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:09,685
Tennessee. Snakes.

118
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:13,026
Thank you, Mulder.
Thank you so much.

119
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:15,463
I say we arrest him and catch
the first flight out of here.

120
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:18,866
He does seem like a likely suspect,
only the local sheriff s office
ruled him out.

121
00:12:18,936 --> 00:12:22,030
Apparently, he was in Kentucky
the nightJared Chirp died.

122
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:24,734
Mulder, there are other people
in his congregation.

123
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:27,744
Jared Chirp died with
a packed suitcase by his side.

124
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:30,645
There's gotta be somebody
that knows where he was headed.

125
00:12:51,135 --> 00:12:53,069
Here you go, honey.

126
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,977
Reverend Mackey?

127
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:12,318
- This might not be the best time,
but can I speak to you?
- Of course.

128
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,553
Jared called the boardinghouse
late the night he died.

129
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:17,958
He wanted to talk to Gracie.

130
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:21,362
I didn't let him.
It was after 2:00.

131
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:24,890
She was sound asleep, and it sounded
to me like the boy had been drinkin'.

132
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:27,062
He just wasn't
makin' any sense.

133
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:29,868
He was rantin' about seein' the devil
and payin' for his sins.

134
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:32,876
Iris, why didn't you
tell the police?

135
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:35,276
I don't know how
to tell Gracie.

136
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:39,680
I kept her from speaking toJared
his last night on earth.

137
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,685
I couldn't have known though.

138
00:13:42,753 --> 00:13:45,187
- I couldn't have.
- No, you couldn't have known.

139
00:13:46,457 --> 00:13:48,755
I can help you
talk to Gracie.

140
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:52,091
- Reverend Mackey? Everybody's here.
- Thank you, Gracie.

141
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:58,194
You and I will see this through,
Iris, right after study group.

142
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:00,203
Thank you.

143
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:11,511
-  Our God is a fearsome God.
-  Amen!

144
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:15,712
He demands our very lives!

145
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:29,931
"'Tis better to be hot or cold
than lukewarm."

146
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:38,639
God says
if you're lukewarm...

147
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:43,078
he will vomit you
out of his mouth!

148
00:14:43,147 --> 00:14:45,081
Yes!

149
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:48,380
- Did you hear what I said?
- Praise God. Praise God.

150
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:53,549
Yes.
God hates the lukewarm!

151
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,992
"'So, because you
are lukewarm...

152
00:14:58,062 --> 00:15:02,499
I am about to spit you
out of my mouth."'

153
00:15:03,868 --> 00:15:06,336
Now, that could sound
pretty harsh, couldn't it?

154
00:15:06,404 --> 00:15:09,168
I mean, depending on
how one reads it.

155
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,267
But if we put this verse
in a historical context,

156
00:15:13,344 --> 00:15:16,575
I think we'll see thatJohn
was specifically addressing...

157
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:19,980
the problems of
the church of Laodicea.

158
00:15:20,051 --> 00:15:23,452
God wants you hot!

159
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:28,047
God wants you on fire!

160
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,694
PraiseJesus!

161
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:37,999
God wants you
to put your money...

162
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:40,970
where your mouth is!

163
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:55,214
People ask me why
I handle snakes.

164
00:15:55,286 --> 00:15:58,187
- Hallelujah! I tell 'em...

165
00:15:58,255 --> 00:16:01,713
it's 'cause the scripture
tells me to!

166
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:04,056
Praise God!

167
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,066
He offers to join us,

168
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:14,798
to come into our lives
and dine with us...

169
00:16:14,872 --> 00:16:17,568
if only we'd open the door.

170
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:24,180
Hallelujah!

171
00:16:26,784 --> 00:16:29,344
Hallelujah!

172
00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:33,223
The manner in which
John ends this chapter,

173
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:38,626
his emphasis is on teaching the church
of Laodicea perseverance.

174
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:41,893
He uses the word "overcome"
not once, but twice.

175
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:55,772
Good Lord, come save me
I'm comin'to the light

176
00:16:55,846 --> 00:17:00,545
Good Lord, come save me
I'm comin' to the light

177
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:05,612
Good Lord, come save me
I'm comin' to the light

178
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,457
Sing songs of praise
to the Lord

179
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:15,556
Good Lord, I love you
I know that you're the light

180
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:20,093
- Good Lord, I love you
I know that you're the light
- Witness the power!

181
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:23,197
- Witness the awesome power...

182
00:17:23,274 --> 00:17:27,870
of God as he
blesses his people...

183
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:31,403
and destroys his enemies.

184
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:34,917
Thank you, God!

185
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:28,294
I don't understand it.
None of us saw or heard anything.

186
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:32,830
Just her scream. When we ran in,
she was lying on the floor.

187
00:18:32,907 --> 00:18:37,241
I cleared everybody out of the building
once I saw the bite marks, but...

188
00:18:37,312 --> 00:18:39,746
Reverend, how close
was Iris toJared Chirp?

189
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:42,374
Not particularly close,

190
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,317
but I'd spoken with her
not 15 minutes earlier about him.

191
00:18:45,387 --> 00:18:49,118
- What'd you talk about?
- She was upset.

192
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,286
Something aboutJared calling her
the night he died, looking for Gracie.

193
00:18:53,361 --> 00:18:55,921
Something about
him paying...

194
00:18:55,997 --> 00:18:58,363
for his sins.

195
00:18:58,433 --> 00:19:01,960
But I don't know. We didn't get
to finish our conversation.

196
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:05,438
Maybe that was the point.

197
00:19:10,945 --> 00:19:15,041
Why Iris?
Why is this happening?

198
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:26,524
Gracie, we're investigating the leader
of your former church, Enoch O'Connor.

199
00:19:26,594 --> 00:19:30,963
We believe he may have had something
to do with what happened here tonight.

200
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:36,197
We would appreciate anything
you could tell us about him.

201
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:38,739
No, he didn't do this.

202
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:42,305
He didn't do this.

203
00:19:42,377 --> 00:19:44,868
This is Satan's work,
not man's.

204
00:19:48,616 --> 00:19:51,483
Gracie, that sounds like something
Reverend O'Connor might say.

205
00:19:51,553 --> 00:19:54,886
Now, you're not a member
of that congregation anymore.

206
00:19:54,956 --> 00:19:59,484
I understand this, because you're
someone who thinks for herself.

207
00:19:59,561 --> 00:20:03,998
Keeping an open mind, Gracie,
is it conceivable that O'Connor
could've done any of this?

208
00:20:04,065 --> 00:20:07,501
No! Don't you think
I would know?

209
00:20:07,569 --> 00:20:09,730
Me, of all people?

210
00:20:09,804 --> 00:20:12,238
He couldn't have done this.
He just couldn't.

211
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:21,044
-  Gracie might be biased.
- O'Connor is your father.

212
00:20:29,324 --> 00:20:31,417
When Gracie got pregnant...

213
00:20:31,493 --> 00:20:36,726
O'Connor barred her from his church...
she and Jared Chirp.

214
00:20:37,866 --> 00:20:40,300
His church and his home.

215
00:20:56,184 --> 00:21:00,678
- You comin'?
- I think I'll check around back.

216
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:20,268
"Pray for the souls...
lost to us. "

217
00:22:39,988 --> 00:22:42,889
Oh!

218
00:22:51,565 --> 00:22:54,261
You must be judged!

219
00:23:02,843 --> 00:23:04,777
Repent!

220
00:23:04,845 --> 00:23:08,281
Pray for the Lord's
quickening power.

221
00:23:11,018 --> 00:23:13,509
To the hands of God.

222
00:23:16,657 --> 00:23:18,887
Let her go!

223
00:23:32,006 --> 00:23:35,339
Your F.B.I. partner could've
learned something about herself...

224
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:37,570
if you hadn't
have stopped me.

225
00:23:37,645 --> 00:23:41,206
Some powerful good news, maybe.

226
00:23:41,281 --> 00:23:44,478
I'd say it's good news for you
that she's not here right now,

227
00:23:44,551 --> 00:23:47,816
considering what you
tried to do to her.

228
00:23:49,323 --> 00:23:51,416
Is that what you did
to your wife?

229
00:23:54,294 --> 00:23:56,228
Alice O'Connor.

230
00:23:56,296 --> 00:24:01,495
Succumbed to multiple
snake bites inJune 1994.

231
00:24:02,803 --> 00:24:05,670
It happened during
a church service...

232
00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:08,003
or at least, that's what
you told local police.

233
00:24:10,711 --> 00:24:12,906
You got away with it...

234
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,914
almost.

235
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,441
What was, uh, the problem
with your wife?

236
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,978
Was she not...
righteous enough for you?

237
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:29,290
Just like your daughter's boyfriend...
or Iris Finster?

238
00:24:29,363 --> 00:24:34,801
Educated man.
Too smart to know any better.

239
00:24:34,868 --> 00:24:37,769
Smart enough to know
you're a murderer.

240
00:24:37,838 --> 00:24:41,865
Satan is near,
and you don't even have eyes.

241
00:24:41,942 --> 00:24:44,137
You're just proud
and fancy free.

242
00:24:44,211 --> 00:24:47,669
Man, no one quite passes
muster with you, huh?

243
00:24:47,748 --> 00:24:52,515
You feel the need to exact
some kind of Old Testament revenge?

244
00:24:54,855 --> 00:24:58,655
What about your daughter?
What were your plans for her?

245
00:25:01,228 --> 00:25:03,321
I pray for her soul.

246
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:07,492
I pray and I pray,
because she's lost.

247
00:25:07,568 --> 00:25:09,900
Because she no longer
believes as you do?

248
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:15,408
You think because you're educated,
you're better than most? You ain't.

249
00:25:16,877 --> 00:25:19,846
Unless you're smart
down here...

250
00:25:19,913 --> 00:25:24,680
the devil's gonna make a fool of you,
and you ain't even gonna know it.

251
00:25:34,361 --> 00:25:37,228
I changed my mind.
I don't want to see him.

252
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,967
Besides, I won't do any better than
you people at getting him to talk.

253
00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:49,908
Gracie.

254
00:25:49,977 --> 00:25:52,878
You still don't believe
your father did it?

255
00:25:54,148 --> 00:25:56,241
It don't matter
what I believe.

256
00:25:57,618 --> 00:25:59,779
He'll be judged
as he deserves.

257
00:26:00,854 --> 00:26:02,754
Can't nobody avoid it.

258
00:26:58,245 --> 00:27:00,179
Help me, Jesus.

259
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:53,987
Deputy found him
about an hour ago.

260
00:27:54,065 --> 00:27:57,057
There's no telling
when he was attacked.

261
00:27:57,135 --> 00:28:00,127
I guess it's looking less and less
like he's a suspect.

262
00:28:00,204 --> 00:28:03,002
Unless he somehow managed
to do this to himself...

263
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:07,035
as a test of
his own righteousness.

264
00:28:07,111 --> 00:28:10,706
Well, if so, Mulder, the jury's
still out. I just spoke to his doctors.

265
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:14,649
- It's a tossup as to whether
he's gonna pull through this.
- What about antivenin treatment?

266
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:16,744
- He's not receiving it.
- Why not?

267
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:19,915
Gracie stepped in. She's trying to
forbid treatment on religious grounds.

268
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:23,222
It's not clear whether she has a legal
claim to do it, but she says that...

269
00:28:23,294 --> 00:28:25,854
it's up to God as to
whether he lives or dies.

270
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:29,866
And you're thinking that her actions
may not be entirely motivated...

271
00:28:29,934 --> 00:28:33,028
by concern for her
father's eternal soul?

272
00:28:33,104 --> 00:28:35,538
Well, more to the point,
Mulder, what if she did this?

273
00:28:35,606 --> 00:28:39,906
She told me that her father
would be judged as he deserves.

274
00:28:39,977 --> 00:28:44,539
- You think this is what she meant?
- She grew up around snakes.

275
00:28:44,615 --> 00:28:47,778
Who's to say she isn't every bit
as adept at handling them as he is?

276
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:51,948
I can see her being angry enough
at her father to attack him,

277
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:54,753
but what about the others?

278
00:29:05,803 --> 00:29:09,603
He left in a hurry.
Packed one suitcase and a gun.

279
00:29:10,675 --> 00:29:13,269
Earlier that night
he calls Gracie,

280
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:17,110
gets Iris instead and starts rambling
about paying for his sins.

281
00:29:17,181 --> 00:29:19,775
He's frightened
and wants to leave town,

282
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,375
presumably with Gracie.

283
00:29:22,453 --> 00:29:24,546
So what's he scared of?

284
00:29:28,492 --> 00:29:30,687
I don't understand
how O'Connor's church...

285
00:29:30,761 --> 00:29:33,252
exerts a strong pull
on these people.

286
00:29:33,331 --> 00:29:35,663
- It's not so hard to understand.

287
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,668
It's a culture with a very
well-defined set of rules.

288
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:41,671
- It's an intolerant culture, Mulder.
- I don't know, Scully.

289
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:44,640
Sometimes a little intolerance
can be a welcome thing.

290
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:47,678
Clear-cut right and wrong,
black and white, no shades of gray.

291
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:51,181
In a society where hard and fast rules
are harder and harder to come by,

292
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:54,116
- I think some people
would appreciate that.
- You're saying that you,

293
00:29:54,185 --> 00:29:57,154
Fox Mulder, would welcome someone
telling you what to believe?

294
00:29:57,221 --> 00:30:00,679
I'm just saying that somebody
offering you all the answers...

295
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,852
can be a very
powerful thing.

296
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:15,205
Oh, it's lab results.

297
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:20,338
Am I reading this right? DidJared Chirp
have himself tested for sterility?

298
00:30:22,046 --> 00:30:24,514
Which turns out to be
more or less the case.

299
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,352
Based on this, that means Jared
can't be the father of Gracie's baby.

300
00:30:30,421 --> 00:30:33,288
It's dated the day he died.

301
00:30:33,357 --> 00:30:37,726
So maybe he was killed
because he discovered the truth.

302
00:30:52,943 --> 00:30:55,138
Gracie...

303
00:30:55,212 --> 00:30:57,407
I'd like to ask
you to reconsider.

304
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:59,847
No. This is what he'd want.

305
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:02,545
He may die without
medical treatment.

306
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,646
I've seen him bit
a dozen times.

307
00:31:05,723 --> 00:31:07,714
He always said that
it was up to God...

308
00:31:07,792 --> 00:31:09,953
whether he lives or dies.

309
00:31:10,027 --> 00:31:12,359
Said it was a worse sin
not to trust God.

310
00:31:13,731 --> 00:31:17,360
There are many ways
to trust God, Gracie.

311
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:21,496
One of them is to trust in
the miracles of doctors and medicine.

312
00:31:22,573 --> 00:31:26,873
Or in your heart...

313
00:31:26,944 --> 00:31:29,572
do you really not want him
to get better?

314
00:31:31,382 --> 00:31:33,316
It ain't for me.

315
00:31:36,887 --> 00:31:39,255
I can't risk his soul.

316
00:31:42,124 --> 00:31:44,217
When you first came to me,

317
00:31:44,293 --> 00:31:47,456
you said that you wanted
to think for yourself...

318
00:31:49,265 --> 00:31:51,495
to live your life...

319
00:31:51,567 --> 00:31:53,831
as you saw fit.

320
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:58,997
If you stand here
and let your father die,

321
00:31:59,074 --> 00:32:01,372
whose beliefs
are you living?

322
00:32:01,443 --> 00:32:03,308
Yours...

323
00:32:04,513 --> 00:32:06,310
or his?

324
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,330
You're doing
the right thing.

325
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:25,596
I'll go tell the doctor, okay?

326
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,491
Agents, Enoch O'Connor is gone.

327
00:33:00,569 --> 00:33:02,833
I was away for five minutes.
His bed's empty.

328
00:33:02,905 --> 00:33:04,964
Gracie is gone too.

329
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,770
How could Gracie have possibly
gotten him out of here?

330
00:33:07,843 --> 00:33:10,141
- Maybe he took her.
- He was on his deathbed.

331
00:33:10,212 --> 00:33:12,680
That's impossible.
And besides, what's his motivation?

332
00:33:12,748 --> 00:33:16,548
I may be able
to answer that.

333
00:33:16,618 --> 00:33:20,679
Jared Chirp wasn't the father
of Gracie's child.

334
00:33:20,756 --> 00:33:22,690
We know that.
What about it?

335
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,364
Enoch O'Connor is.

336
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:35,468
That's why she wanted to get away
from him and his church...

337
00:33:35,537 --> 00:33:37,971
as fast as she could.

338
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,304
And I tried to teach her
to forgive him.

339
00:33:44,513 --> 00:33:47,346
Uuh! Daddy, please!

340
00:33:53,956 --> 00:33:55,981
I'm bringin' you home.

341
00:34:01,997 --> 00:34:04,693
Somebody help me!

342
00:34:09,671 --> 00:34:14,131
In the name of our holy
and most fearsome God.

343
00:34:14,209 --> 00:34:16,871
Hallelujah!

344
00:34:16,945 --> 00:34:20,278
Resist the devil
and he will flee.

345
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:23,341
Resist him!

346
00:34:23,419 --> 00:34:26,911
Something's wrong.
Something's wrong with my baby.

347
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:28,923
Oh!

348
00:34:36,165 --> 00:34:38,759
DearJesus, put your hands
on this woman. You can heal her.

349
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:41,359
Oh, yes, God. That's it.

350
00:34:41,437 --> 00:34:44,873
Yes, Jesus. Yes, Jesus.

351
00:34:46,641 --> 00:34:50,077
O Lord. Dear Lord.

352
00:34:50,144 --> 00:34:52,612
DearJesus,
deliver this woman.

353
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,740
Jesus. Jesus.

354
00:34:55,817 --> 00:34:58,877
Yes, Lord. Yes, Jesus.

355
00:34:58,953 --> 00:35:02,480
- No! Don't, don't!
- Dear God.

356
00:35:02,557 --> 00:35:06,152
Dear Heavenly Father,
deliver this woman.

357
00:35:06,227 --> 00:35:08,718
Lay your hands
on this woman.

358
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:11,822
- God! Yes!
- No!

359
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,996
- Don't! Don't!
- Yes. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.

360
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,605
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

361
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:27,739
DearJesus. DearJesus.

362
00:35:27,815 --> 00:35:30,943
HolyJesus! Hallelujah!

363
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:36,013
DearJesus! Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!

364
00:35:38,226 --> 00:35:41,161
Hallelujah! DearJesus!

365
00:36:07,956 --> 00:36:11,653
- How is she?
- Deep shock and some loss of blood.

366
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:16,329
What happened here?

367
00:36:16,397 --> 00:36:19,127
- Where's the baby?
- These folks aren't talkin'.

368
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,225
Scully.

369
00:36:22,503 --> 00:36:24,596
Take a look at this.

370
00:36:28,776 --> 00:36:31,301
Snakes.

371
00:36:33,715 --> 00:36:35,979
She gave birth to snakes?

372
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:40,245
The devil has
been cast out.

373
00:36:41,923 --> 00:36:44,414
Stay with her.

374
00:36:44,492 --> 00:36:47,120
- Where are you going?
- To find her father.

375
00:36:47,195 --> 00:36:49,459
He's gonna wanna tie up
some loose ends.

376
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:15,055
You stole what was
most precious to me.

377
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,281
Gracie?

378
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:20,725
She came to me on her own.

379
00:37:20,795 --> 00:37:23,958
- She wanted to escape a life of fear...

380
00:37:24,032 --> 00:37:27,229
and judgment,
of intolerance.

381
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:32,665
- Please, O God...
- She fled a harsh and vengeful God...

382
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:36,502
and you.

383
00:37:44,352 --> 00:37:46,843
Drop the knife!

384
00:37:47,789 --> 00:37:51,384
Uuh!

385
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:02,101
You all right?

386
00:38:07,108 --> 00:38:10,339
- Daddy?

387
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:12,641
- Daddy?
- Gracie, it's Agent Scully.

388
00:38:12,713 --> 00:38:15,147
We're taking you to the doctor
right now, okay?

389
00:38:15,216 --> 00:38:19,084
- No, I gotta...
- Can you tell me what happened, Gracie?

390
00:38:20,822 --> 00:38:23,518
Ohh!

391
00:38:23,591 --> 00:38:27,391
- Where's my daddy?
- You're safe, Gracie.
My partner's gone after him.

392
00:38:29,497 --> 00:38:31,795
Gracie, you're gonna be okay.
He can't hurt you anymore.

393
00:38:31,866 --> 00:38:36,462
You don't understand.
He saved me.

394
00:38:45,313 --> 00:38:48,077
I'll call for an ambulance.

395
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:51,478
Relax.
Help's on the way.

396
00:38:52,553 --> 00:38:55,886
No, it's not.
I told you, boy,

397
00:38:55,957 --> 00:38:58,892
you still don't know
which side you're on.

398
00:38:59,961 --> 00:39:03,124
Be smart. Down here.

399
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:12,105
Yes, please hurry.
They're on their way.

400
00:39:18,112 --> 00:39:21,377
- Agent.
- It wasn't O'Connor.

401
00:39:21,449 --> 00:39:23,917
It was you.
You killed Jared Chirp.

402
00:39:23,985 --> 00:39:28,445
- You're joking.
- No. I'm just beginning to see it now.

403
00:39:28,523 --> 00:39:32,755
Jared must've come to understand that
he wasn't the father of Gracie's baby...

404
00:39:32,827 --> 00:39:34,761
that you were.

405
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:38,424
Did he confront you earlier that night,
only to see you for who you really are?

406
00:39:38,499 --> 00:39:41,593
Just who is it
you think I am?

407
00:39:41,669 --> 00:39:44,604
Is that what happened
with Iris Finster?

408
00:39:44,672 --> 00:39:47,140
Was she beginning to catch on?
Is that why you killed her?

409
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:50,871
Or was it just to further frame
Enoch O'Connor?

410
00:39:50,945 --> 00:39:55,473
Is that was this is really about?
Ruining O'Connor? Seducing his daughter?

411
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,917
Destroying him by
any conceivable means?

412
00:40:04,188 --> 00:40:08,887
- Are you a righteous man, Agent Mulder?
- Stay where you are.

413
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:12,295
It's just a simple question.

414
00:40:12,363 --> 00:40:17,960
Most people believe they're
on the side of angels.

415
00:40:18,036 --> 00:40:20,732
But are they?

416
00:40:22,774 --> 00:40:27,336
If you were put to the test,
how would you do?

417
00:40:27,412 --> 00:40:29,471
- Aah... aah!

418
00:40:55,974 --> 00:40:58,499
Where's Mulder?

419
00:40:58,576 --> 00:41:01,943
- Help!
-  No!

420
00:41:02,013 --> 00:41:05,540
You can't help him.
This is his alone.

421
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:11,782
Mulder!

422
00:41:26,037 --> 00:41:27,698
Aah!

423
00:41:58,536 --> 00:42:02,768
- Mackey?
- No, still no trace,

424
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,970
even though every law enforcement agency
in Tennessee's out looking for him.

425
00:42:07,045 --> 00:42:09,411
They won't find him.

426
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,211
People think the devil
has horns and a tail.

427
00:42:13,284 --> 00:42:16,481
They're not used to looking for
some kindly man who tells you
what you want to hear.

428
00:42:16,554 --> 00:42:18,579
He's just a man, Mulder...

429
00:42:18,656 --> 00:42:22,854
- Just like O'Connor.
- Not like O'Connor.

430
00:42:22,927 --> 00:42:25,760
If this was some kind of test,
looks like I failed.

431
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:29,425
I'd say if it was,
you passed with flying colors.

432
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:34,199
- You're alive, aren't you?
- Proud and fancy free.

433
00:42:41,312 --> 00:42:45,476
Reverend Wells, it's a real joy
to have a man in the pulpit...

434
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:48,713
who has such an open and modern way
of looking at God.

435
00:42:48,786 --> 00:42:51,118
Bless you for saying so.

436
00:42:51,189 --> 00:42:54,488
Well, I won't keep you.
I just wanted to welcome you to Hamden.

437
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:57,892
Thank you.
I look forward to seeing you on Sunday.

438
00:42:57,962 --> 00:42:59,896
Thank you.
