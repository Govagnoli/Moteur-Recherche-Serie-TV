1
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,713
Charlie! Come on, Charlie!

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,356
- Here you go, sweetie.
- Charlie, hey! Ice cream.

3
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,076
Hey, buddy! Do you want
some ice cream? Yeah?

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,152
Here, Charlie. Here you go.

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,959
Look! There it goes!
Going to balloon land. Go bye-bye.

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,318
- <i>(baby cries)</i>
- Oh, ssh. Oh, sweetie, don't cry.

7
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,550
Hey, look. Here's some ice cream.
Want some ice cream?

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,870
Look. Here.

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,269
Teddy... Teddy, here's your balloon.

10
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,909
- Look at that! Here you go.
- Oh! Such a mess.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,788
- We gotta clean you up.
- Charlie and I'll wait for you.

12
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,430
- That was my balloon.
- Eat your ice cream before it melts.

13
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,478
I don't want any ice cream. I want my balloon.

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,351
We'll get you a balloon, OK?

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,908
No. I want <i>my</i> balloon.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,275
Fine. We'll get you another balloon.

17
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,229
That was a waste of good money.

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,320
Ooh! There we go.

19
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,151
Yes.

20
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,831
OK. Ohh!

21
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,476
There we go. That's a boy.

22
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,154
What a good boy. OK.

23
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,192
OK, Teddy. I'll be right back, OK?

24
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,719
<i>§ There were six in the bed

Teddy?

36
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,555
Teddy!

37
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,391
Teddy!

38
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,359

Teddy!

41
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,713
Teddy!

42
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,116
<i>(steam-engine whistle)</i>

43
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,475
- <i>(man)</i> There's a kid on the track!
- Oh, my God!

44
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,355
Teddy!

45
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,432
Teddy! Get away from there!

46
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,876
Teddy!

47
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,516
<i>(dad)</i> Teddy, come here!

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,836
Damn! <i>(blows whistle)</i>

49
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,229
Teddy!

50
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,959
Tell Teddy to get off the track!

51
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,711
No!

52
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,791
Oh, my God!

53
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,831
Teddy?

54
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,916
<i>(mom sobs)</i>

55
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,629
Maggie... Teddy...

56
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,871
<i>(Mulder)</i> This was taken
at an amusement park three months ago.

57
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,191
The young boy in the background
is Teddy Holvey, aged two.

58
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,670
- He was killed seconds after this was taken.
- How?

59
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,958
According to the police report, he wandered
in front of the miniature train.

60
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,749
The conductor was unable to stop
due to malfunctioning brakes.

61
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,115
Teddy's dad works
for the State Department.

62
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,796
A coroner's inquest was held due to
the unusual circumstances of the accident.

63
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,553
- Did the inquest find anything unusual?
- No.

64
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,668
But the county medical examiner was
disturbed by this case and by this photo...

65
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,876
...and I think with good reason.

66
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,951
You see, this is a helium balloon.

67
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,828
One thing I learnt in kindergarten
is when you let them go, they float up.

68
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:34,109
- But this is moving away horizontally.
- Did you learn about wind in kindergarten?

69
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,193
The National Weather Service say
on that day the wind was blowing north.

70
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,637
But the balloon is moving south,
as if it's being pulled against the wind.

71
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,950
- Pulled? By whom?
- I don't know.

72
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,713
So I came to Chuck,
the king of digital imaging.

73
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,759
Chuck can extract incredibly small details
from a photographic print.

74
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,479
Not details. Information. Watch the monitor.

75
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,030
We have limitations on how much
the eye can perceive unaided.

76
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,434
But with this special software, which I
designed, we can detect hidden information.

77
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,990
We can manipulate it, enhance it.

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,309
Now watch right here.

79
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,589
There it is.

80
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,673
It's clearly a concentration
of electromagnetic energy.

81
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,639
So you're saying that, uh...
a ghost killed Teddy Holvey?

82
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,508
Did anyone check
the camera that took the photo?

83
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,751
- The lens or the pressure plate?
- It all checked out, Scully.

84
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,359
I think this is clearly
some kind of poltergeist activity.

85
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,637
This is the same reason
why you'll see a newspaper photo...

86
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,759
...with Jesus' face appearing
in the foliage of an elm tree.

87
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,400
It's a chance occurrence of light and shadow.

88
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,155
To get on the tracks, Teddy Holvey
escaped this childproof halter...

89
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,199
...that his mom had tied to a sink.
- I've seen some slippery two-year-olds.

90
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,510
So the CME put it on his own two-year-old...

91
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,717
...and found it was impossible
for the kid to free himself.

92
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,951
So unless Teddy was
the reincarnation of Houdini...

93
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,032
And that would be an X-File in itself.

94
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,879
I don't understand.
There's already been a formal inquest.

95
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,390
We're here apart from that investigation.

96
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,153
We believe something
may have been overlooked.

97
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,435
Like what?

98
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,957
The possibility Teddy
may have been helped onto the tracks.

99
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,112
- Oh, my God.
- There were over a hundred witnesses.

100
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,911
We saw Teddy ourselves. He was chasing
a balloon. There was no one else around.

101
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,229
It was an awful accident,
but that's all it was - an accident.

102
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:18,110
<i>(Mulder)</i> Do you have any reason to suspect
someone may have wanted to hurt Teddy?

103
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,034
<i>(Maggie)</i> He was just a baby.
Why would anybody want to hurt him?

104
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,430
<i>(dad)</i> I don't know what you're
getting at. We loved Teddy.

105
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,958
If you're suggesting this is like that woman
who drowned her kids, you're way out of line.

106
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,830
Mrs Holvey, did you hear anything in the
bathroom right before Teddy disappeared?

107
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,878
I already told the inquest I heard nothing.

108
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,832
Mrs Holvey, at the time of the accident
did you have any hired help?

109
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,118
No. My mother came to live with us
once Teddy was born.

110
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,479
Around the time of Teddy's death, had you
noticed anything strange happening?

111
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,028
Things moved, odd objects appearing?

112
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,792
<i>(high-pitched alarm)</i>

113
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,758
It's that damn smoke detector.
I'll be right back.

114
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,310
Does this happen often?

115
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,949
It's an old house.
We have a problem with the wiring.

116
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,308
<i>(speaks Romanian)</i>

117
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,196
- Mother.
- <i>Diavolo!</i>

118
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,396
Mother, it was just a false alarm.

119
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,950
No! <i>(speaks Romanian)</i>

120
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,311
Mother! Stop it!

121
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,795
What is she saying?

122
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,952
- Maggie!
- You marry a devil.

123
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,389
You have devil child!

124
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,675
<i>(dad)</i> I'm sorry.

125
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,599
<i>(door opens)</i>

126
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,030
D'you recognise this?

127
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,430
- It's a swastika.
- It's also known as a gammadion or a fylfot.

128
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,239
It's an ancient symbol
used for protection or good luck...

129
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,118
...used by various cultures
since the Middle Ages.

130
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,919
The child had one on
the back of his hand last night.

131
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,117
My guess? It was drawn
by the old lady - to protect the boy.

132
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,556
- Yes, I saw her drawing it.
- You didn't think that was strange?

133
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,712
I think this boy needs
as much protection as he can get...

134
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,951
...but just not from ghosties
or beasties. Look at this.

135
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,148
Have you ever heard of
Münchhausen by proxy?

136
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,198
Yeah, my grandfather used
to take it for his stomach.

137
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,953
When a parent or caretaker
brings harm to a child...

138
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,192
...by inducing symptoms, usually as
a way of getting attention or status.

139
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,271
Look at Teddy's medical history.

140
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,989
You'll see that he was admitted
to various hospitals ten times...

141
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,914
...during the two years he was alive.
That's once every three months.

142
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,230
Projectile vomiting at three months...

143
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,756
...diarrhoea at four months,
vomiting, diarrhoea, diarrhoea...

144
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,832
Each time they were unable
to determine the cause.

145
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,118
- And no one questioned this?
- The family moved around with Steve's job.

146
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,636
Records take time to transfer
from hospital to hospital.

147
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,192
But this abuse is not limited to just one child,
so I checked out Charlie's history as well.

148
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,556
- He had medical problems too?
- Since his brother was born...

149
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,712
...which is right when
Holvey's mother-in-law moved in.

150
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,794
Often the perpetrator of Münchhausen
by proxy will view the child as evil.

151
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:27,159
The old woman would be a likely candidate,
but it could be any family member.

152
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,756
Do you feel like taking a walk
over to the State Department, Scully?

153
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,517
Things have been strange since Golda,
my mother-in-law, moved in with us.

154
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,558
I met Maggie in Romania in 1984.

155
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,997
Golda forbade our marriage,
said I was the devil.

156
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,868
After I transferred back to the US,
things got somewhat better...

157
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,158
...until Teddy was born
and she came to live with us.

158
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,277
That's when the strangeness really started.

159
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,351
What kind of strangeness?

160
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,795
Superstitions rule Golda's life.

161
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,228
She'll spit if anyone compliments the kids.

162
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,075
Once she moved in, she poured hot water
over the threshold to ward off demons...

163
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,879
...tied red strings around the kids' wrists.

164
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,396
One day I caught her
throwing chicken guts on the roof.

165
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,155
Then Teddy and Charlie
started getting sick... a lot.

166
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,189
- And you suspect Golda?
- She'll call Charlie evil right to his face.

167
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,239
But at the same time she dotes on him
like... she's afraid of him.

168
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,834
Afraid <i>of</i> him or <i>for</i> him?

169
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,156
I just don't know.

170
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,869
Are you familiar with
Münchhausen by proxy?

171
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,474
Are you accusing us of child abuse?

172
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,308
Teddy's medical records
have raised some questions.

173
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,828
I could never say this to Maggie, but...

174
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,717
...I've wondered if it wasn't Golda who snuck
in and let Teddy out of the bathroom that day.

175
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:07,279
I'd like to interview your son Charlie, Mr
Holvey, but with a professional counsellor.

176
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,430
This is gonna be hard.

177
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,996
- <i>(Steve)</i> Maggie!
- What do they want? To take Charlie away?

178
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,799
They just want him
to talk with a social worker.

179
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,078
- They'll put lies into Charlie's head.
- You're being unreasonable.

180
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,312
You want to take him away! You blame me
for Teddy and you want to take him away.

181
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:36,191
I won't listen to this. This is ridiculous! If you
wanna come, you can. I'm taking Charlie now.

182
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,878
No, Steven!

183
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,748
- What was that?
- <i>(speaks Romanian)</i>

184
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,718
Come on, Charlie, let's get your coat.

185
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,995
- You have no right to do this!
- Maggie.

186
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,034
Come on. We'll meet you out front.

187
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,149
- OK, you buckled in there?
- Yeah.

188
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,031
Dammit!

189
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,838
No! No!

190
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,708
Daddy! No!

191
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,518
Noooo!

192
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,393
No! Daddy!

193
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,038
No!

194
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,590
Mulder.

195
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,311
Daddy!

196
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,239
Daddy! No!

197
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,757
Daddy!

198
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,558
No!

199
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,230
Daddy! Daddy!

200
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,909
You see this?

201
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,791
- Find anything?
- Yeah, maybe.

202
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,435
It looks like ash.

203
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,114
Yeah. It's everywhere. Look at this.

204
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,276
The Holveys said earlier
they had problems with the wiring.

205
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,432
- It could be the motor shorted out.
- No, the motor's fine.

206
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,069
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know, but I'll have this analysed.

207
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,277
Before we do anything,
we should get Charlie out of here.

208
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,875
I called a social worker
who's gonna come down and make a report.

209
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,590
- The courts will be reluctant to intervene.
- Not when a child is in danger.

210
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,231
And not after they see two dead roosters
in the old woman's bedroom.

211
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,311
Really?

212
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,632
- Still think this is Münchhausen by proxy?
- Without a doubt.

213
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,476
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

214
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,389
Stay away from our house!

215
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,997
- Hey. You wanna see something weird?
- What?

216
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,152
Chem lab analysis of
the ash from the Holveys' house.

217
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,676
No trace of any metal,
no carbon, no oxygen, no nothing.

218
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,991
- What do you mean?
- It contains nothing organic or inorganic.

219
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,552
In fact, according to the technicians,
this ash doesn't exist. Come on.

220
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,592
- Where are we going?
- To get a second opinion.

221
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,831
Oh, wow!

222
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,073
Haven't seen this for a while.
Not since India, 1979.

223
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,238
- India?
- Before Chuck succumbed to academia...

224
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,195
...he did a tour of duty on the old hippie trail.
- It's called vibuti.

225
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,558
Holy ash. Technically it's called an apport -
something that materialises out of thin air.

226
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,552
Wait a second.
Nothing materialises out of thin air.

227
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,713
You've read the Bible? Remember
Jesus creating the loaves and the fishes?

228
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,590
- Yeah, but that was a parable.
- In 1979 I witnessed a guru named Sai Baba...

229
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,910
...create an entire feast out of thin air.

230
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,632
Too bad you didn't take a picture and use
your computer to see the entire Last Supper.

231
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,750
Vibuti is created during the presence
of spirit beings or during bilocation...

232
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,039
...which is a phenomenon where a person's
energy is transported to a different location.

233
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,715
That energy could have been
what set off the garage-door opener.

234
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,837
Yeah, that - or somebody
activated the remote control.

235
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,150
Well, who are you suggesting did that?

236
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,994
Who was standing outside when
the garage door opened on us yesterday?

237
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,197
The old lady... and Charlie.

238
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,630
<i>(chanting in Romanian)</i>

239
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,398
<i>(boy cries out in Romanian)</i>

240
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:45,640
Mrs Holvey? My name is Karen Kosseff.
I'm a social worker with the FBI.

241
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,110
I've been instructed
to file a report for the court.

242
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,159
- May I come in?
- No.

243
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:59,115
- Please, I've already had enough trouble.
- I understand, Mrs Holvey.

244
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,590
But if you won't talk to me,
I'll have to put that in the report...

245
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,468
...and it could very well
complicate your situation.

246
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,234
- Mommy!
- Charlie?

247
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,150
Oh, my God!

248
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,276
Charlie! It's OK, Charlie.

249
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,875
It's OK. It's OK, Charlie. It's OK.

250
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,829
He's been sick. My mother was
supposed to be looking after him.

251
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,429
Mother? Mother!

252
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,828
- <i>(Golda speaks Romanian)</i>
- Get out of my house!

253
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,036
<i>(speaks Romanian)</i>

254
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,551
<i>(speaks Romanian)</i>

255
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,158
Get out!

256
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,516
I have had enough, Mother.

257
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,515
I want you out of my house.

258
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,591
<i>(Golda speaks Romanian)</i>

259
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,836
No!

260
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,832
Mother! Mother!

261
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,354
<i>(speaks Romanian)</i>

262
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,353
Mother!

263
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,359
The grandmother's taken the child
and locked him in the room with her.

264
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,750
- She may have a knife. I've called 911.
- What happened?

265
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,992
There were three strange men.
They were performing some kind of ritual.

266
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,719
<i>(Charlie)</i> No! No, Nanna!

267
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,194
<i>(screams hysterically)</i>

268
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,991
<i>(speaks Romanian)</i>

269
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,671
It is the only way.

270
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,551
No!

271
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,791
Mother!

272
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,392
<i>(speaks Romanian)</i>

273
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,075
Oh, my God!

274
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,151
Oh, no! <i>(sobs)</i>

275
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,037
Mother! Mother!

276
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,153
- Did you talk to Charlie?
- He says he doesn't remember anything.

277
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,949
The coroner's preliminary report
says she died of a heart attack.

278
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,157
But those wounds...
I'd swear her eyes were pecked out.

279
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,518
There was more ash on the floor beneath
the old woman's body. And look at this.

280
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,037
- What is it?
- It's mugwon't. I think it's a ceremonial herb.

281
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,715
- Was this a ritual killing?
- No, the reverse swastika on the window...

282
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,076
...and the red string around his wrist
are protective devices.

283
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,549
- Protection against what?
- I don't know.

284
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,191
But the old woman knew the family was
in trouble. Those men were here to help her.

285
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,670
<i>(Maggie)</i> I told you before,
get out of my house!

286
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,835
<i>(speaks Romanian)</i>

287
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,431
I am not interested in your superstition.

288
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,114
Now get out. Now!

289
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,878
- Mrs Holvey?
- It's all right.

290
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,270
- Who are they?
- They are the Calusari.

291
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,638
In Romania they are responsible for
the correct observance of sacred rites.

292
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,109
What did he say?

293
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,274
He said it's not over.

294
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,989
- The evil is still here.
- Excuse me.

295
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,711
Sir? Can I have a word with you?

296
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,555
Sir, I'm with the FBI.
I'd like to ask you some questions.

297
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,714
You were trying to protect the family, weren't
you? You said there was still evil here.

298
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,076
Sir! I can arrest you if I have to.

299
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,228
The evil that is here has always been.

300
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,517
It has gone by different names
through history.

301
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,353
Cain, Lucifer, Hitler.

302
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,558
It does not care if it kills
one boy or a million men.

303
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,152
If you try to stop us,
the blood will be on your hands.

304
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,631
Mrs Holvey?

305
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,560
I know this is a difficult time, but there are
some questions that need to be answered.

306
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,632
My mother used to say that evil follows evil.

307
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:05,516
Once someone suffers a misfortune,
they'll always have bad luck.

308
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,394
I used to think that was just a superstition.

309
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,677
Now I don't know what to believe.

310
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,999
I blamed her, you know?

311
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,275
For all that's happened.

312
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,393
I thought maybe she was
putting a curse on us to punish me.

313
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,517
Punish you for what?

314
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,194
For abandoning the old ways.

315
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,715
I was raised to believe, as she did, in spirits.

316
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,551
The unseen world.

317
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,830
When I married Steve and came
to this country, I left all that behind.

318
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,158
Do you know what kind of ceremony
she was performing upstairs?

319
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,592
She was trying to cleanse the house of evil.

320
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,512
She thought Charlie
was responsible somehow.

321
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,875
How could he be responsible
for all this horror?

322
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,719
He's just a little boy!

323
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:22,277
I think we should talk to Charlie and find out
what happened in your mother's bedroom.

324
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,792
Charlie?

325
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,271
I was told they found you in
your grandmother's room yesterday.

326
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,829
Can you tell me about it?

327
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,474
Do you remember how you got there?

328
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,551
No.

329
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,879
Your mother said
you were there. Remember?

330
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,235
I wasn't there!

331
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,629
Many people saw you in the room.

332
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,439
It wasn't me! I wasn't there! It wasn't me!

333
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,636
- Who was in the room?
- No!

334
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,632
Was there someone else in the room?

335
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,188
No! I didn't hurt her!

336
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,077
Charlie? Charlie!

337
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,720
Who hurt your grandmother? Charlie!

338
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,519
- It was him!
- Who, Charlie? Who?

339
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,473
It was Michael! Michael!

340
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,550
Mrs Holvey?

341
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,154
We never told him.

342
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,232
It was agreed upon. It was our secret.

343
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,318
What secret, Mrs Holvey?
What are you talking about?

344
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,550
Michael.

345
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,757
He was Charlie's twin.

346
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,070
He was stillborn.

347
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,438
Steven and I agreed
never to tell Charlie about it.

348
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,509
My mother...

349
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,469
...she wanted to perform a ritual of separation
when she heard of Michael's death -

350
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,949
...to divide their souls.

351
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:06,392
She said... if we didn't,
the world of the dead would follow Charlie.

352
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,558
But it was just a superstition.

353
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,313
Help! I need your help.

354
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,834
- Charlie?
- He's having some kind of seizure.

355
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,515
Don't restrain him.
Let's turn him on his side.

356
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,034
Charlie, you're going to be OK.

357
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,231
- How's Charlie?
- He's resting. How's Mrs Holvey?

358
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,791
I'm amazed she hasn't broken down.
She's in the waiting room, trying to sleep.

359
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:39,352
The doctor said that Charlie had a seizure,
but they're unable to determine the cause.

360
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,513
I'm sorry, Charlie. I didn't mean
to scare you. I'm Nurse Castor.

361
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,512
I'm just gonna give you
something to help you sleep.

362
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,718
- No, I don't want a shot!
- I know, but if you spit out your medicine...

363
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,189
...we have to give it to you some other way.
- No!

364
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,750
Just relax. It won't hurt.
Afterwards I'll give you a sticker.

365
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,991
- Leave me alone!
- Charlie, it'll just be a little pinch.

366
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,389
- Now I want you to relax.
- Stop it!

367
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,153
- Charlie... Now, I want you to behave.
- Leave me alone!

368
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,832
- Charlie, I want you to behave. Just relax.
- No! Don't do it! Don't do it!

369
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,958
No, Michael!

370
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,276
Michael, don't!

371
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,871
Mommy?

372
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,636
- I want to go home now.
- Charlie?

373
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,996
What are you doing up?
Why are you dressed?

374
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,116
They said I could go home now.

375
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,393
- Who said that?
- The doctors.

376
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,755
They said I could leave.

377
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,670
All right, then.

378
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,796
Let's just get your coat.

379
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,270
- And we'll talk to the doctors.
- No, Mommy.

380
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,920
Let's just go home. Now!

381
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,028
OK, Charlie.

382
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,509
We'll go straight home.

383
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,469
What are you looking at?

384
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,995
- Is that Mrs Holvey?
- Where?

385
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,394
There.

386
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,074
I think she's got Charlie with her.

387
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,751
Ohh...

388
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,471
Oh.

389
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,870
Nurse!

390
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,190
- Are you all right?
- He hit me.

391
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,589
- Who? Charlie?
- No, not him. The other one.

392
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,911
There were two of them. Two boys.

393
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,311
- You gotta get to Mrs Holvey.
- Why?

394
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,198
The boy who left with
Mrs Holvey wasn't Charlie.

395
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,670
- Are you saying she left with a ghost?
- Or a spirit. I'm not sure.

396
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:25,117
It's what was in the photo and what the
old woman tried to protect the family from.

397
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,991
It's killed three people. You've got to get
to Mrs Holvey's before it happens again.

398
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,958
- What are you gonna do?
- Get help.

399
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,677
- There you go, Charlie.
- Aren't you going to have some?

400
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,479
No, dear. I'm not hungry.

401
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,792
- Tomorrow we can go to the park.
- Yes. Sure.

402
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,110
Can I have a balloon?

403
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,633
Uh-huh.

404
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,756
Can we ride the train, Mommy?

405
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,875
Now, you finish up
and Mommy will be right back, OK?
