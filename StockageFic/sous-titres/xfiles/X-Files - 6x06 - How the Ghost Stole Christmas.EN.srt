The dark, gothic manor.

It was a time of dark,
dark despair.

35
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:15,902
American soldiers were dying at an
ungodly rate in a war-torn Europe,

36
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:19,606
while at home, a deadly flu virus
attacked young and old alike.

37
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,408
Tragedy was a visitor
on every doorstep,

38
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:25,445
while a creeping hopelessness set in
with every man, woman and child.

39

for a pair
of star-crossed lovers,

43
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,222
tragedy came not
from war or pestilence,

44
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,658
not by the boot heel
or the bombardier,

45
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,651
but by their own
innocent hand.

46
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,598
- Go on.
- His name was Maurice.

47
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,601
He was a brooding
but heroic young man...

48
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:52,594
beloved of Lyda, a beauty
with a light that followed her
wherever she went.

49
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,742
They were likened to two angels
descended from heaven,

50
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,777
whom the gods could not protect
from the horrors...

51
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:01,614
being visited upon
this cold, gray earth.

52
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,583
And what happened to them?

53
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,652
Driven by a tragic fear
of separation,

54
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,421
they forged a lovers' pact...

55
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,924
so that they might spend
eternity together...

56
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,526
and not spend
one precious Christmas apart.

57
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,396
They killed themselves?

58
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:20,389
And their ghosts haunt this house
every Christmas Eve.

59
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,636

ourselves to imagine something...

would discount out of hand.

Hard to say.
People now,

none of that really happened
out there tonight.

542

That was all in our heads, right?

It must have been.

When have you
proved me wrong?

Well, why else would you
want me out there with you?

You didn't want to be there?

548

Oh, that's, um,
