That's Angie on the right.

I should add this is the condition

32

I'd say predation, but the bones
would be scattered.

Not to mention that these skeletons

The bodies may have been stripped,

38
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,865

kind of acid solution.

39
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,368
Maybe the arrangement
of the bodies...

40

has some meaning for
the killer or killers.

41
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,539
But at any rate, I'd term it
""ritualistic.''

00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:10,091
- It's all fuzzy and--
- You were with your husband--
with Wallace.

169
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,407
There was a light--
a bright light.

170
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:19,311
Where was that light coming from ?
From the mountain ?

171
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,580
Over Brown Mountain.

172
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,573
There were strange lights dancing
over the peak and--

173
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,979
and they took me
and Wallace too.

174
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,061
And then what happened ?

175
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:38,564
Just... it all went black.

176
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,734
And when I woke up,
I didn't know where I was...

177
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:45,137
and I couldn't see
Wallace anymore.

178
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:48,140
They returned me first.

179
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,010
This-- This place
that they took you to,

180
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,412
can you describe it to me,
tell me what it looked like ?

181
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:56,715
It was... white--

182
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,717
a white place.

183
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:02,421
It was featureless.
I was lying on a table...

184
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:05,024
and I couldn't get up.

185
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,627
I mean, nothing was holding me down,
but I couldn't move.

186
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:12,431
Were there men there ?

187
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,300
Yes, there were men...

188
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,293
standing over me,
but I couldn't see their faces.

189
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:24,076
Did they perform tests on you ?

190
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:28,080
Yes, they did tests--

191
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,073
terrible... tests.

192
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,855
You have a--

193
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:40,325
- You have a scar back here
on the back of your neck.
- What ?

194
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:43,162
- What scar ?
- <i>It's fresh.</i>

195
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:46,498
- What is that ?
- It's an implant.
I've seen this before.

196
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:49,334
Yes. The drill--
I remember the drill.

197
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,271
I-- I couldn't see it at first.
That was the worst part.

198
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,306
But I could hear it spinning...

199
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:57,109
and it was coming
out of the light--

200
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,711
- What did they put in me ?
- Is there one in me ?

201
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:02,448
No. Male abductees
don't usually report this.

202
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:06,085
And everything she says is textbook
down to the last detail, except for one.

203
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,588
- What ?
- Two skeletons identified
as yours and Angie's ?

<i>It doesn't make sense.</i>

the cattle mutilations you hear about.

206
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,330
- <i>Maybe they're part of their tests.</i>
- I had that thought.

207
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,100
But there's no precedent.
It's in none of the literature.

208
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,702
Well, they didn't want
anybody to find us.

- Long story.

- This is my partner, Agent Scully.

Yeah, I think you were meant to.

the Brown Mountain lights.

00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:48,547
<i>They took me to a white place.</i>
<i>There were men there.</i>

I understand about this case,
this is not what happened to me.

They were fake. They were decoys.

What about that organic substance
we found on the skeletons ?

so interested in ?

266

It was nothing.
It was bog sludge.

maybe he fell in it or...

00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:16,995
the most logical.

What is the most
logical explanation ?

00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:35,135

nor was I able to fully account for

No.

it was the least plausible.
