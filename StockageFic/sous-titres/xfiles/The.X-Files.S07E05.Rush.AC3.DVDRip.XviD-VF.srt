1
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,143
Max?

2
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,308
Max, you there?

3
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,091
You're late, kid.

4
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:07,597
- You get lost?
- Sorry. I had to wait
till my mom took off.

5
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,363
It's way past
his bedtime, Max.

6
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,172
He's not cut out for this.

7
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,669
Cut out for what?

8
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,837
Oh, there's more here
than just trees.

9
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,715
Before you can find out what,

10
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:26,616
I gotta know that you're not gonna
tell anyone about this place.

11
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,711
I won't. I swear.

12
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,648
It's a vow, Tony. Don't make it
if you're gonna break it.

13
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:36,388
I won't break it, man.
Not ever.

14
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,631
No matter what?

15
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,828
Even if someone
dies tonight?

16
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,189
Anthony Reed.

17
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:12,156
- Got any outstanding warrants?
- No, of course not.

18
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,724
Well, I'm gonna have to
check it out for myself.
So, put your hands on the vehicle.

19
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,430
- Look, I was just taking a walk.
- Uh-huh.

20
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,565
Right past all those big
"no trespassing" signs?

21
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,575
Now you just stand there
for a minute.

22
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,612
Come on, man.
I didn't do anything.

23
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:30,046
I wish I had a nickel for every time I
had to drag you kids out of these woods.

24
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:34,246
It'd be a lot of nickels.
Do you have any calls from dispatch?

25
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,426
Sir?

26
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,722
Dispatch to Foster.
I didn't copy your last transmission.

27
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,563
Officer?

28
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,472
Dispatch to Foster,
do you copy?

29
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:08,581
Deputy Foster, this is Dispatch.
Do you copy?

30
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,790
Deputy Foster, sir,
what's your 20?

31
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,029
Oh. There you are.
Heavy traffic?

32
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:30,262
Slow going. Let's just say
I had ample time to read
the police report you faxed me.

33
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:34,465
Thoughtfully provided by the
local authorities, even though
it doesn't tell the whole story.

34
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:38,373
A sheriff s deputy is slain
during a routine patrol.

35
00:04:38,443 --> 00:04:41,537
It's a tragic occurrence, but
I don't see the mystery here, Mulder.

36
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:44,946
Except said that the deputy was beaten
to death by an invisible assailant.

37
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:47,952
Yes, but that's according to the
young man who's accused of his murder.

38
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,353
One Tony Reed, and I'm guessing
wrongfully accused.

39
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:53,948
He's an "A" student, moved here
a few months ago from Philadelphia.

40
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:56,085
He's never been in trouble
in his life.

41
00:04:56,161 --> 00:05:01,189
Tell me you've got more than
S.A.T. scores to show that Tony
Reed didn't commit this crime.

42
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:03,894
Maybe. Take a look
at the body.

43
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:18,475
The former Deputy Ronald Foster.

44
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,613
As you can see, the report doesn't
quite do it justice.

45
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:26,783
Oh, my God. It looks like
he was hit with a sledgehammer.

46
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:29,292
Police flashlight.

47
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:31,989
One blow.

48
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:39,903
Damage to the maxilla facial
bones and the cranium...

49
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:45,068
is consistent with
a blunt force trauma, but...

50
00:05:45,143 --> 00:05:48,510
I'd say that Tony
eats his Wheaties.

51
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,515
Check out the back
of his head.

52
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:04,154
His eyeglasses.

53
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:06,493
Penetrated to the back
of his skull.

54
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:09,864
Babe Ruth couldn't hit this hard,
let alone a high school sophomore.

55
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:13,564
Well, maybe if he was under
the influence of P.C.P.
or some kind of stimulant.

56
00:06:13,638 --> 00:06:16,630
- No, his tox screen came back negative.
- Well, even so,

57
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:20,838
I mean, stress and fear
may have triggered an adrenalin
response which is known to...

58
00:06:20,912 --> 00:06:22,880
enable feats of
near super human strength.

59
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:26,543
Agent Mulder? How long you plannin'
on bein'down here?

60
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:29,416
Sheriff Harden, this is
my partner, Agent Scully.

61
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:31,683
How long you plan
on bein' down here?

62
00:06:31,757 --> 00:06:35,557
I'd like Ron left in peace. I don't
know what there is to see anyway.

63
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:39,119
- We got the kid who did it.
- Sheriff, we don't mean
to second-guess you.

64
00:06:39,197 --> 00:06:42,724
- We're just hoping to be
of some assistance.
- Well, I don't need it.

65
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:45,361
I got the murder weapon
with bloody fingerprints,

66
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:49,965
and once the state crime lab
matches that up with Tony Reed,
it's open and shut.

67
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:54,103
- Well, uh, we're done here, right?
- Mm-hmm.

68
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:57,376
But, Sheriff Harden, you won't mind
if I talk to Tony Reed, do you?

69
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:01,545
I mean, it won't hurt your case. And
if he did do it, you'll wanna know why.

70
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:17,331
What?

71
00:07:17,402 --> 00:07:21,236
Well, Tony, this must be
your lucky day for visitors.

72
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:25,072
- This is Agent Scully with the F.B. I...
- I'm not talkin' anymore, okay?

73
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:27,941
Well, that might
make things worse.

74
00:07:28,013 --> 00:07:30,072
They seem pretty bad
already.

75
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:34,778
In your statement, you say that
Deputy Foster stopped you.

76
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:37,447
But you don't say why.

77
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,323
Come on.
You were cruisin', right?

78
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:46,023
I mean, a small town like this, you're
not exactly livin' la vida loca.

79
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:51,091
I know. I grew up in Dullsville too.
Nothing to do but drive and park.

80
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:55,162
How long ago was that?
Look.

81
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,800
Don't you think
I know what you're doing?

82
00:07:57,876 --> 00:08:01,835
You're like the tenth cop
who's come in here trying to
relate to me till I confess.

83
00:08:01,913 --> 00:08:06,577
If you didn't do it, it's all
the more reason to clear it up.

84
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:11,020
Everything I know...
is in my statement.

85
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:13,956
Okay, but bear with us,
'cause we're old and stupid.

86
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:17,688
How long was it between
the time you heard the scream...

87
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:20,492
to the time that you found
Deputy Foster?

88
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:28,030
Tony, you're not likely
to get a fairer hearing than this.

89
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:35,509
Maybe ten, fifteen seconds.

90
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:41,012
You didn't see anyone near the
patrol car? You didn't hear anything?

91
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:44,180
And you're still
gonna stick with your story...

92
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:46,918
that you were the only one there,
is that right?

93
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,094
Uh...

94
00:08:57,168 --> 00:08:59,261
I wanna go back
to my cell.

95
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:13,740
Sixteen years old and his life is over
unless he starts tellin' the truth.

96
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:17,185
If you really think he's guilty,
why don't you ask yourself this:

97
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:19,587
Why wouldn't he make up
a more plausible cover story?

98
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:22,718
Why didn't he say that a pickup
full of hillbillies...

99
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:26,161
drove by and clobbered
the deputy and ran away?

100
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:28,631
I'm not saying he's guilty.

101
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,260
I'm inclined to agree that Tony Reed
did not commit murder.

102
00:09:31,336 --> 00:09:35,432
But I think that he saw the person who
did, and he may be covering up for it.

103
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:38,908
I'm not sure there was a person to see.
I think there was a force at work here.

104
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:44,074
- What kind of force?
- Some kind of territorial
or spiritual entity maybe.

105
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:47,243
Poltergeists have long been associated
with violent acts like this,

106
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:49,480
and they tend to manifest
around young people.

107
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:52,250
They seem to be drawn
to the turmoil of adolescence.

108
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:55,782
Mulder, rather than spirits,

109
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,194
can we at least start
with Tony's friends?

110
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:02,426
Please, just... for me?

111
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,799
I think there's one person in particular
I'd like to talk to.

112
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:10,464
Let's wrap it up, people.

113
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,942
Two-minute warnin'.

114
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:33,589
There goes half
your grade, Max.

115
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:36,600
- You missed the midterm.
- Not if I take it right now.

116
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:41,628
- In one minute?
- Oh, I've been studying.

117
00:10:46,845 --> 00:10:48,813
I don't care
who your father is.

118
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,940
You fail my test, it sticks.

119
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:54,383
I guess I better
ace it then, huh?

120
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:07,789
Take your seat,
young man.

121
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:16,406
- Piece of cake.
- It is when you mark 'em at random.

122
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:18,908
Go ahead. Check it.

123
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:33,856
Maybe I got more goin' on
than people know.

124
00:11:45,502 --> 00:11:49,598
Chastity Raines? I'm Agent Scully.
This is Agent Mulder.
We're with the F.B.I.

125
00:11:49,673 --> 00:11:54,269
- I remember you.
- Chastity, what did you and
Tony talk about this morning?

126
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:58,576
- He didn't kill that cop.
- How can you be so sure?

127
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:02,551
- Tony just doesn't have it in him.
- Do you?

128
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:06,779
Were you there
when it happened?

129
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,116
Look, I gotta go.

130
00:12:10,193 --> 00:12:14,892
Do you realize that Tony
could go to prison for the
rest of his life for this?

131
00:12:14,965 --> 00:12:17,798
Chastity, if you know something,
now's the time to mention it.

132
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,430
- Unless they got a warrant,
you don't have to say nothin'.
- Wow. You must be her lawyer.

133
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:26,806
Let's go.

134
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:30,369
Butting into our investigation.
I wonder what your father,
the sheriff, would think.

135
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:34,474
- How do you know who my dad is?
- You got the same last name.

136
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:36,712
Oh, you're good.

137
00:12:36,787 --> 00:12:39,119
We're done here.
Come on, babe.

138
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:41,282
You must've been
a Betty back in the day.

139
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:47,422
- A "Betty"?
- "Back in the day."

140
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:52,601
Scully.

141
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:56,738
What about the
murder weapon?

142
00:12:56,807 --> 00:13:01,176
All I know is we put the flashlight
in here and now it's gone.

143
00:13:01,244 --> 00:13:05,078
It's like it just disappeared
into thin air.

144
00:13:05,148 --> 00:13:09,414
- How many people have access
to this evidence room?
- Only me and the dozen deputies.

145
00:13:09,486 --> 00:13:12,478
What does the tape show?

146
00:13:12,556 --> 00:13:16,390
That no unauthorized persons came in and
no one went anywhere near this locker.

147
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,951
- Was this here before?
- I don't know.

148
00:13:20,897 --> 00:13:23,491
Can we take a look
at the surveillance tape?

149
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:27,765
You can see that
the flashlight was properly secured.

150
00:13:27,838 --> 00:13:31,501
It's not like we're runnin'some kind
of half-assed operation here.

151
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:33,543
No one's saying
that you are, Sheriff.

152
00:13:35,746 --> 00:13:38,806
Here's when the state police
showed up to take it to the crime lab.

153
00:13:38,882 --> 00:13:40,816
There's me goin'to get it.

154
00:13:40,884 --> 00:13:44,513
We opened up the locker,
and it's gone.

155
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:52,319
I maybe, uh, didn't give you
all the warmest welcome,
but if you have any ideas.

156
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:55,627
- May I?
- I watched it a dozen times.

157
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:59,829
- Could there be a malfunction
with the V.C.R.?
- I don't see how.

158
00:13:59,903 --> 00:14:01,996
Plus, there's no gap
in the time code.

159
00:14:02,072 --> 00:14:06,202
The murder weapon was
the only hard evidence we had.

160
00:14:06,276 --> 00:14:08,471
Without it, we got no case.

161
00:14:08,545 --> 00:14:11,378
You know what I gotta do now?

162
00:14:11,448 --> 00:14:16,044
I gotta call Ron Foster's widow and tell
her that I gotta turn his killer loose.

163
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:27,663
Scully, check this out.

164
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:33,764
- What am I supposed to be seeing?
- Here it comes.

165
00:14:33,837 --> 00:14:35,771
Now you see it.

166
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,273
One more frame.
Now you don't.

167
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:41,071
What do you make of that, Scully?
Take another look.

168
00:14:41,144 --> 00:14:43,112
Now it's here.

169
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,614
Now it's not.

170
00:15:01,064 --> 00:15:03,362
Are you ready to be
straight with me?

171
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:05,901
Leave me alone, Mom.
Would you just leave me alone.

172
00:15:05,969 --> 00:15:07,903
I'm tired!

173
00:15:09,606 --> 00:15:14,066
This isn't like a bad report card,
Anthony. A man is dead.

174
00:15:14,144 --> 00:15:17,136
I told you,
I didn't do it!

175
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:20,809
It's just that what you say happened
doesn't make sense.

176
00:15:20,884 --> 00:15:23,375
There's gotta be
more to it.

177
00:15:23,453 --> 00:15:25,887
Well, there isn't.
Okay?

178
00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:30,816
Are those kids involved in this?
That boy Max?

179
00:15:30,894 --> 00:15:33,920
No.

180
00:15:33,997 --> 00:15:36,898
- Mom, they're the
only friends I have here.
- You're done seein' 'em.

181
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:40,459
- You don't even know them.
- I do know them. I was your age once.

182
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:48,007
Tony, we came here
to get a fresh start,

183
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:51,047
get away from them bad schools,
the wrong crowd.

184
00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:53,810
You are doing so well here.

185
00:15:53,884 --> 00:15:56,819
How would you know?
You're never around.

186
00:16:02,325 --> 00:16:05,419
You think it's my dream
to work two jobs?

187
00:16:05,495 --> 00:16:07,759
I'm doin' it for you, Tony.

188
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:13,633
I just wanna get some sleep.
That's all I want.

189
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:17,132
You got a chance
at a good life,

190
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:19,607
a real future.

191
00:16:19,676 --> 00:16:23,009
We didn't come all this way
so you could throw it away.

192
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,312
Listen to that, man.
This car's got guts.

193
00:17:03,386 --> 00:17:06,355
- Sort of like you that way.
- Whose car is this, Max?

194
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:11,883
Chastity told you to shut up
and sit tight and things would be fine.

195
00:17:11,962 --> 00:17:14,795
- You did that. It tells me a lot.
- Everything's not fine.

196
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:17,332
We're in a stolen car,
a cop is dead.

197
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,494
Calm down, man. He'd been
snoopin' around. He had to go.

198
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:24,267
What do you mean, "He had to go"?
What happened out there?

199
00:17:24,341 --> 00:17:26,901
You gotta learn not
to ask so many questions.

200
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:32,070
Slow the hell down, man!
You're freakin' me out!

201
00:17:32,148 --> 00:17:35,174
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

202
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:38,551
- Max, look out!

203
00:18:12,055 --> 00:18:14,546
I'm gonna make you
one of us.

204
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:19,228
But I call the shots.
Always remember that.

205
00:18:37,781 --> 00:18:40,045
Hey, Chuck.

206
00:18:40,116 --> 00:18:42,983
Sorry to make you trek over here
for what's probably a glitch.

207
00:18:43,053 --> 00:18:45,749
- What'd you come up with?
- Nothing but eye strain at first.

208
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:48,586
Then I ran it through
my imaging software.

209
00:18:48,658 --> 00:18:52,890
I'm here to tell you, it's not a glitch.
It's what the camera saw.

210
00:18:52,962 --> 00:18:57,160
Buckle up, Scully.
I believe Chuck is about to take us on
a ride through the paranormal.

211
00:18:57,233 --> 00:19:01,499
Yes and no. Initially,
I was thinking spectral manifestation.

212
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:06,508
But with spirit activity, you'd expect
to see light streaks, auras,

213
00:19:06,576 --> 00:19:10,205
atmospheric disturbances,
translucent figures.

214
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,044
Whatever this is,
it's not a ghost.

215
00:19:13,116 --> 00:19:17,678
Especially since ghost don't
go around leaving synthetic
polymers in their wake.

216
00:19:17,754 --> 00:19:19,847
That's what the gunk
on the floor turned out to be.

217
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:23,518
Huh. I dig a mystery
with layers.

218
00:19:23,593 --> 00:19:26,357
Chuck, I get the feeling
you don't know what the hell this is.

219
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:29,830
I cross-referenced
the shape's silhouette...

220
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:34,768
against every organic
and inorganic object
in the Library of Congress database.

221
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:38,569
The closest match was
a Soviet Akula class submarine.

222
00:19:39,642 --> 00:19:41,576
I think we can
rule that out.

223
00:19:41,644 --> 00:19:45,882
And then there's
this weirdness.

224
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:49,576
- My enhancement
brought up this dark edge...
-  Mm-hmm.

225
00:19:49,652 --> 00:19:51,620
around the anomaly.

226
00:19:51,687 --> 00:19:54,884
- A shadow.
- It fit with the lighting in the room.

227
00:19:54,957 --> 00:20:00,122
- The problem is it can't be
throwing a shadow unless...
- Unless it's a solid object.

228
00:20:00,196 --> 00:20:02,892
Which is impossible because
it only appears for a single frame.

229
00:20:02,965 --> 00:20:06,128
One-thirtieth of a second.

230
00:20:06,202 --> 00:20:10,298
You know what? Maybe, uh,
SCAG can give us a clearer picture.

231
00:20:10,373 --> 00:20:14,503
- SCAG?
- Spectrographic Color
Attribute Generator.

232
00:20:14,577 --> 00:20:17,910
I'm beta testing it
forJ.P.L.

233
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,677
It's still in the tweaking phase,
but the basic idea is...

234
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:24,083
I assign known color values...

235
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:26,087
onto the black-and-white image.

236
00:20:27,523 --> 00:20:31,357
Then SCAG assigns chromatic values
throughout the frame,

237
00:20:31,427 --> 00:20:34,658
in effect making an
educated guess at, uh,

238
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,324
what all the colors
might be.

239
00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:43,601
It still needs fine tuning.

240
00:20:44,674 --> 00:20:46,699
What?

241
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:49,267
You recognize these colors, Scully?

242
00:21:09,365 --> 00:21:12,630
- Hey, Tony.
- Everyone's looking at me
like I'm a criminal.

243
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:17,032
I'm not.
I heard you took a ride.

244
00:21:17,106 --> 00:21:20,542
What was that?
How did he do it?

245
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:23,237
You'll find out.

246
00:21:23,312 --> 00:21:26,577
Maybe you were right...
about me not bein' cut out for this.

247
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:29,675
It's a little late
for second thoughts.

248
00:21:32,154 --> 00:21:34,588
You tryin' to move in
on my girl?

249
00:21:37,126 --> 00:21:40,186
- Saved by the bell.

250
00:21:55,478 --> 00:21:58,914
Hey, you wanna stare at someone?
Stare at me.

251
00:22:01,517 --> 00:22:03,382
Well, class.

252
00:22:03,452 --> 00:22:06,421
I graded your midterms.

253
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:10,585
Save for a few of you,
the news is not good.

254
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:13,184
Mr. Pembleton.

255
00:22:13,262 --> 00:22:15,560
What happened?

256
00:22:15,631 --> 00:22:18,429
Welcome back, Mr. Reed.

257
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:21,732
Expect to make up
the test tomorrow.

258
00:22:21,804 --> 00:22:26,298
Mr. Harden, you're here
on time for a change.

259
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,605
What's this?

260
00:22:28,677 --> 00:22:32,204
- Self-explanatory, isn't it?
- I got every answer right.

261
00:22:32,281 --> 00:22:36,240
- Not because you knew the material.
- You sayin' I cheated? How?

262
00:22:36,318 --> 00:22:38,252
I have no idea how.

263
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,982
But you did.
And I won't tolerate it.

264
00:22:48,297 --> 00:22:50,959
Back to business, people.

265
00:22:51,033 --> 00:22:53,433
- Mr. Guider?

266
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:55,800
How do I tell Max
that I want out?

267
00:22:55,871 --> 00:22:59,602
I wish I could
help you, Tony.

268
00:22:59,675 --> 00:23:01,768
I can't even help myself.

269
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,274
Babbit!

270
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,365
Oh, my God!

271
00:24:13,082 --> 00:24:16,210
Excuse me, please.
Thank you.

272
00:24:19,221 --> 00:24:21,587
Just stay back.

273
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,126
I'll show you my theory
if you show me yours.

274
00:24:27,196 --> 00:24:30,529
Based on the eyewitness accounts
of the students I spoke to,

275
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:34,433
at this moment I'd have to say
that I don't have one.

276
00:24:35,971 --> 00:24:38,439
What about for
these globs of goo?

277
00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:40,566
- The ones we found in the evidence room?
- Yeah.

278
00:24:40,643 --> 00:24:43,544
I'm guessing Max Harden could tell us
how they got there.

279
00:24:43,612 --> 00:24:46,137
You think Max did this?
Based on what?

280
00:24:46,215 --> 00:24:49,946
I spoke to a few students
myself. Apparently Max
was angry at Mr. Babbit...

281
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:52,988
because he failed him
on his midterm exam, so he had motive.

282
00:24:53,055 --> 00:24:56,286
Well, he may have had motive,
but he didn't have opportunity.

283
00:24:56,358 --> 00:24:58,792
There was nobody here
who saw him even go near the victim.

284
00:24:58,861 --> 00:25:02,558
Maybe he didn't need to.
I pulled his records.

285
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:06,897
Rising attendance and discipline
problems the last few months.
But look at this transcript.

286
00:25:06,969 --> 00:25:10,370
As his behavior was getting worse,
his grades were going through the roof.

287
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:14,933
- This kid has changed, Scully.
- He's a teenager.
Everything about him is changing.

288
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:18,878
His body and his brain chemistry
is in a state of unparalleled upheaval,

289
00:25:18,948 --> 00:25:21,917
plus there's peer pressure
and-and substance abuse.

290
00:25:21,984 --> 00:25:24,680
Any one of these factors
could alter his behavior radically.

291
00:25:24,753 --> 00:25:28,211
What if it's given him a kind of
psychokinetic or paranormal ability...

292
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:32,750
that allows him to exert force
over a victim without ever
laying a finger on him?

293
00:25:32,828 --> 00:25:35,353
- That's your theory?
- Yes, it is.

294
00:25:35,431 --> 00:25:38,229
Soon to be proven as soon
as I get Max in for questioning.

295
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,825
- Agent, you needed to speak
to Sheriff Harden?
- Yeah.

296
00:25:40,903 --> 00:25:43,303
- I want to talk to him about his son.
- He's with him now.

297
00:25:43,372 --> 00:25:48,435
They're taking him
to the emergency room.
Max just collapsed in the parking lot.

298
00:25:53,082 --> 00:25:56,381
You hear about Max?
Is he okay?

299
00:25:56,452 --> 00:26:00,855
- Where are you going?
- Tony, the less you know,
the better, all right?

300
00:28:11,186 --> 00:28:13,746
What, no candy, no flowers?

301
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:16,586
My deputy
told me you were comin'and why.

302
00:28:16,658 --> 00:28:21,721
So you can just turn around.
Whatever happened at that school,
my son didn't do it.

303
00:28:21,796 --> 00:28:24,765
Sheriff, we'd like to ask your son
a few questions, if that's okay.

304
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:28,325
The boy's sick. The doctors
can't even say what's wrong with him.

305
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:31,839
Max could tell them. You know why
you collapsed, don't you, Max?

306
00:28:31,907 --> 00:28:33,932
Yeah. Too much teen spirit.

307
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:36,910
You think?
Smells like murder to me.

308
00:28:36,978 --> 00:28:39,845
Who do you think
you're talkin'to here?

309
00:28:39,915 --> 00:28:42,349
Yeah, it's not like you got
a damned thing on me.

310
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:45,511
You got a problem with
authority figures, don't you, Max?

311
00:28:45,587 --> 00:28:48,920
If I wasted Babbit, then how did
I do it? Am I like Carrie or somethin'?

312
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,288
I used some kind
of mental powers?

313
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:56,661
No, somethin'else. You figured
out a way to tap into something
that gives you super powers.

314
00:28:56,731 --> 00:28:59,859
Came in handy with Babbit
and Deputy Foster.

315
00:29:01,202 --> 00:29:03,363
Man, you're whistlin'
"Dixie."

316
00:29:03,438 --> 00:29:05,872
High temperature
and heart rate.

317
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:09,138
Low blood sugar.
Electrolytes show acidosis.

318
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:14,807
All these symptoms are consistent
with extreme exertion and withdrawal.

319
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:17,283
Withdrawal?
From what?

320
00:29:17,352 --> 00:29:21,755
The rush. I think
whatever it is that gives you
the power to rearrange furniture...

321
00:29:21,823 --> 00:29:24,986
and turn a flashlight into a battering
ram also gives you quite a buzz.

322
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,154
Well, if I can do all that,
what's stoppin' me from doin' it to you?

323
00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:30,288
I don't know.

324
00:29:30,365 --> 00:29:32,663
Maybe the effect's
worn off.

325
00:29:32,734 --> 00:29:35,066
Maybe you need
another fix.

326
00:29:35,136 --> 00:29:37,730
As soon as I blow out of here,
I'll be sure to get one.

327
00:29:37,806 --> 00:29:40,001
That's not gonna happen
any time soon.

328
00:29:40,075 --> 00:29:42,509
Your condition's getting worse.

329
00:29:42,577 --> 00:29:45,842
And we're not gonna be able to help you
unless you can tell us what's going on.

330
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:52,577
Boy, is any of this true?

331
00:29:52,654 --> 00:29:56,818
- No.
- You better pray I don't find out it is.

332
00:29:58,493 --> 00:30:01,291
Sir? Can we have
a word outside?

333
00:30:20,482 --> 00:30:24,179
He's not a bad kid.
He just needs discipline.

334
00:30:24,252 --> 00:30:26,948
If your son is in trouble,
I'm sure you'd want to know about it.

335
00:30:27,022 --> 00:30:30,480
With that in mind, we'd like permission
to search your house.

336
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:32,492
You're not getting it.

337
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:37,623
I'm not ready to jump on a bandwagon
and call my boy a murderer.

338
00:30:42,037 --> 00:30:45,666
There's some, uh, test results
missing from Max's chart.

339
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,231
I think we should
track 'em down.

340
00:30:50,712 --> 00:30:52,646
Thanks.

341
00:31:00,188 --> 00:31:02,679
Hot off the presses.

342
00:31:03,758 --> 00:31:06,090
Anything interesting?

343
00:31:06,161 --> 00:31:09,255
- This can't be right.
- What is it?

344
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:12,628
Oh, my God.

345
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:14,635
What?

346
00:31:14,703 --> 00:31:18,036
Evidence of cerebral lesions
from repeated concussions.

347
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,572
Arthritis in the spine
and major joints.

348
00:31:23,978 --> 00:31:26,503
Stress fractures.

349
00:31:26,581 --> 00:31:28,811
Numerous muscle and...

350
00:31:31,152 --> 00:31:33,518
- And ligament micro-tears.
- What would cause this?

351
00:31:33,588 --> 00:31:36,557
In a teenager?
I can't even imagine.

352
00:31:36,624 --> 00:31:39,855
This is the kind of thing that you'd see
in someone who's crashed race cars...

353
00:31:39,928 --> 00:31:43,386
or played pro football
for 15 years.

354
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,963
Whatever Max is doing,
it's killing him.

355
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:52,097
I think I'm starting
to get it.

356
00:32:24,672 --> 00:32:28,665
- I thought I saw
a young lady come in here.
- I wish.

357
00:32:42,824 --> 00:32:45,588
Max Harden's personal effects.

358
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,594
Yeah.

359
00:32:54,335 --> 00:32:56,496
This is it.
Those globs we found...

360
00:32:56,571 --> 00:32:58,971
this is where
they came from.

361
00:33:00,675 --> 00:33:03,303
Speed, Scully. Somehow Max
Harden has found a way...

362
00:33:03,378 --> 00:33:06,541
- To move faster than the eye can see.
- Mulder.

363
00:33:06,614 --> 00:33:09,913
That would explain how Babbit
was killed. It would also
explain how a chair and table...

364
00:33:09,984 --> 00:33:12,384
appeared to move on their own
with enough force to penetrate a wall.

365
00:33:12,453 --> 00:33:14,648
Force equals mass times acceleration.
Isn't that right?

366
00:33:14,722 --> 00:33:19,159
Yes, but it's impossible. The human body
isn't designed to move like that.

367
00:33:19,227 --> 00:33:22,856
Exactly. That is... That is why
his is falling apart.

368
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:25,525
Agents, could you...

369
00:33:47,222 --> 00:33:49,486
Max... Max, please don't do this.
You can stop.

370
00:33:49,557 --> 00:33:51,821
Sure. Just like you can.

371
00:33:51,893 --> 00:33:54,259
I mean hurting people.
Haven't enough people already been hurt?

372
00:33:54,329 --> 00:33:57,355
This is not why
I got you out!

373
00:33:57,432 --> 00:34:00,890
- Let's leave here. Let's just go away.
- And do what?

374
00:34:00,969 --> 00:34:03,096
Find a place
to get some help.

375
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:07,733
Help for what? This is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

376
00:34:09,444 --> 00:34:12,208
I can't go back to things
standin' still.

377
00:34:13,414 --> 00:34:15,746
And neither can you.

378
00:34:27,028 --> 00:34:29,861
Tony, what are you
doing here?

379
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:32,263
You went in that cave,
didn't you?

380
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:34,301
You shouldn't have done that.

381
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:40,068
It was such a rush...
moving fast like that.

382
00:34:40,141 --> 00:34:44,407
I didn't want this for you.
How did you find it?

383
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:48,040
I followed you.
I was worried about you.

384
00:34:48,116 --> 00:34:50,880
That's so sweet.

385
00:34:50,952 --> 00:34:55,446
I wish things were different
than how they are.

386
00:34:55,523 --> 00:35:00,483
Maybe they can be. With Max in
the hospital, we could go to the cops.

387
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,764
He's out.

388
00:36:08,394 --> 00:36:10,328
Oh, my God.

389
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:23,642
Hello?

390
00:36:44,597 --> 00:36:47,191
Boo.

391
00:36:56,342 --> 00:36:58,503
You killed Ron Foster.

392
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,706
Yeah, I did.

393
00:37:01,781 --> 00:37:04,011
Why?

394
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:07,450
I don't know.
You want some great reason?

395
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,081
You little son of a bitch!

396
00:37:11,157 --> 00:37:13,853
He thought he was
really somethin'.

397
00:37:13,926 --> 00:37:16,360
Always liked to
push people around.

398
00:37:16,429 --> 00:37:20,365
Same as Babbit...
and same as you.

399
00:37:21,701 --> 00:37:23,635
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

400
00:37:30,309 --> 00:37:33,176
I can't let you do this, Max.

401
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,714
- Take him to O.R. one.
- All right.

402
00:37:49,295 --> 00:37:51,229
Yo, Scully.

403
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:56,201
How bad are his injuries?

404
00:37:56,269 --> 00:37:59,727
It's too soon to tell. He's unconscious
and bleeding internally,

405
00:37:59,806 --> 00:38:01,967
apparently from a blow
to the abdomen.

406
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:06,671
Yeah, delivered with this.
Max's weapon of choice against cops.

407
00:38:06,746 --> 00:38:10,045
Why would he leave it behind? Do you
think he's doing it to taunt the police?

408
00:38:10,116 --> 00:38:12,209
No, I think somebody intervened.

409
00:38:12,285 --> 00:38:15,880
I think that's why the sheriff is
still alive and why his gun is missing.

410
00:38:15,955 --> 00:38:20,016
But if he can do what you claim, then...
then who could possibly intervene?

411
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:23,619
The someone who knows exactly
how Max does what he does.

412
00:38:23,696 --> 00:38:26,221
And someone who's finally
standing up to him.

413
00:38:26,299 --> 00:38:28,563
Tony. How do we find him?

414
00:38:28,634 --> 00:38:32,035
Well, I would guess the source
where Max gets his power from.

415
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:35,301
The woods near where
the deputy was killed.

416
00:38:35,374 --> 00:38:37,899
Tony never came clean
about what he was doing out there.

417
00:38:37,977 --> 00:38:41,003
Well, maybe that's why
the deputy was killed.

418
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,241
Maybe he got too close
to the truth.

419
00:38:46,152 --> 00:38:48,643
Chastity,
we don't have to be doing this.

420
00:38:48,721 --> 00:38:50,848
I told you, I took care
of things with Max.

421
00:38:50,923 --> 00:38:53,687
No, you didn't,
and you shouldn't have tried.

422
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:57,320
- He was gonna kill his father.
I had to stop him.
- He let you.

423
00:38:57,396 --> 00:38:59,762
He was slowing down.
Tony, you've slowed down too.

424
00:38:59,832 --> 00:39:02,699
If we don't get back to the cave
before Max does, we're history.

425
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:27,654
- Hurry!
- I'll catch up.

426
00:39:59,725 --> 00:40:02,216
Chastity?

427
00:40:02,295 --> 00:40:04,263
Are you okay?

428
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,560
You're late, kid.

429
00:40:07,867 --> 00:40:10,734
- What did you do to her?
- She took a swing at me.

430
00:40:10,803 --> 00:40:14,762
You believe that?
You got it all turned around.

431
00:40:28,254 --> 00:40:30,188
Come on, man.

432
00:40:32,058 --> 00:40:35,494
Who do you think
you're dealin' with?

433
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:43,125
All I ever wanted was
you to be my friend, Tony.

434
00:40:43,202 --> 00:40:45,136
You stuck a knife
in my back.

435
00:40:47,106 --> 00:40:49,597
And now I'm gonna
mess you up.

436
00:41:02,955 --> 00:41:04,786
I'm sorry, Tony.

437
00:41:04,857 --> 00:41:06,882
I can't go back.

438
00:41:44,263 --> 00:41:46,493
Chastity?

439
00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:13,023
Did the U.S.G.S. show up?

440
00:42:13,092 --> 00:42:17,188
Eighteen geologists
and three semis full of gear.
They covered every inch of that cave.

441
00:42:17,263 --> 00:42:20,630
- And what'd they come up with?
- Nothing.

442
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:23,759
A little bat guano and above normal
magnetic field readings,

443
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:26,896
but nothing that would
cause a physiological effect.

444
00:42:26,972 --> 00:42:29,133
- What'd you expect them to find, Mulder?
- I don't know.

445
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:31,267
A vortex like the one
in Oregon.

446
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:34,312
Gravitational aberrations,
unique chemical compositions,

447
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:38,043
relics that would indicate
the cave was a sacred site.

448
00:42:38,117 --> 00:42:40,051
Something. Anything.
I don't know.

449
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:44,215
You and I were both in there,
and nothing happened to us.
We're still slow-poking around.

450
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:46,656
What if we're too old?

451
00:42:46,725 --> 00:42:49,387
You said teenagers differ...

452
00:42:49,462 --> 00:42:51,930
from adults chemically
and physiologically.

453
00:42:51,997 --> 00:42:54,090
What if whatever's in that cave
effects only them?

454
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:56,691
Well, that's doubtful.

455
00:42:56,769 --> 00:42:59,260
But no more so
than any other theory.

456
00:42:59,338 --> 00:43:01,636
I mean,
it's worth checking out.

457
00:43:01,707 --> 00:43:03,698
Yeah?
Well, we can't.

458
00:43:03,776 --> 00:43:06,540
As of an hour ago,
they pumped concrete into the cave,

459
00:43:06,612 --> 00:43:09,240
sealed it for
precautionary reasons.

460
00:43:09,315 --> 00:43:11,249
We'll never know.

461
00:43:13,018 --> 00:43:15,418
How's he doin'?

462
00:43:15,488 --> 00:43:18,286
Bruises and
muscle strains mostly.

463
00:43:18,357 --> 00:43:22,293
He'll recover.
Go back to being a normal kid.
