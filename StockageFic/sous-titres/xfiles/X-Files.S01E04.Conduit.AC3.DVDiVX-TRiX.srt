( loudrumbling )

00:01:22,763 --> 00:01:24,663
The kids.

00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:27,359
Boy:
Mom! Mom! Mom!

4
00:01:27,434 --> 00:01:28,867
Kevin.

00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:33,669

00:01:33,774 --> 00:01:38,040
( KevinScreaming )

7
00:01:40,847 --> 00:01:44,078
Mom! Ruby's gone!

8
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:48,383
Ruby?

9
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:51,049
Ruby?

10
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:53,183
Ruby?

11
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:57,229
Ruby?

12
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,695
Ruby!

00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:00,716
Blevins:
AgentMulder's latest302

14
00:03:00,794 --> 00:03:03,558
requesting assignment
and travel expenses

15
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,564
for the both ofyou.

16
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:07,993
Sioux City, lowa.

17
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:11,070
That's the first
l've heard ofit.

18
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:12,900
lt came up through channels

19
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:15,407
from Mulder's ASAC
to the district G-1 4

20
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:17,943
and onto my desk.

21
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:19,273
l don't understand.

22
00:03:19,346 --> 00:03:22,315
ln essence, Mulder
is petitioning the bureau

23
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:24,213
to assign a case number

24
00:03:24,284 --> 00:03:26,115
to a tabloid headline.

25
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:29,349
He must have
more evidence than...

26
00:03:29,422 --> 00:03:32,016
Not according to his 302.

27
00:03:32,092 --> 00:03:35,289
l admit, that is strange...

28
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:36,795
even for Mulder.

29
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:50,001
Perhaps it has something
to do with this.

30
00:03:50,076 --> 00:03:51,543
Take a look.

31
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:52,839
An X file?

32
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:13,131
Has he shared
any ofthis with you?

33
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,566
There's no need
to protect him.

34
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:19,469
He's the agent ofrecord.
He initiated the file himself.

35
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:24,477
She was his sister.

36
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:27,672
She disappeared 21 years ago.

37
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:30,910
He was 1 2 and she was eight.

38
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:34,147
He claims that he was
in the room when it happened.

39
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,350
He recalls a bright light
outside the window

40
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:42,555
and, uh... and a presence
in the room.

41
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:45,655
ln your opinion

42
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:47,824
has Agent Mulder's
personal agenda

43
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:49,925
clouded
his professional judgment?

44
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:52,504
ln my opinion, no.

45
00:04:52,606 --> 00:04:55,268
Butyou can see how
it might appear that way.

46
00:04:55,342 --> 00:04:57,810
As you know,

47
00:04:57,877 --> 00:05:01,540
Agent Mulder's preoccupation
with fringe matters

48
00:05:01,615 --> 00:05:05,278
has been a big source
offriction in the Bureau.

49
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:07,684
This is another case in point.

50
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:10,018
l'm going to disallow the 302.

51
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,615
With respect, sir,

52
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:14,990
at least let me talkwith him

53
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:18,497
and make a recommendation.

54
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:20,225
ltjust doesn't seem...

55
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:24,599
substantial enough
to warrant an investigation.

56
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:26,605
Okay, Scully, so we disagree.

57
00:05:26,673 --> 00:05:28,868
lt's not the first time,
and it won't be the last.

58
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:30,967
At least ifwe had
a legitimate source...

59
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:33,171
This is the essence
ofscience.

60
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:35,942
You ask an impertinent question

61
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:37,950
and you're on yourway
to a pertinent answer.

62
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:41,784
What makes this case
any more credible

63
00:05:41,855 --> 00:05:44,517
than the hundred-year-old mother
with the lizard baby?

64
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:46,525
Because the lizard baby

65
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:49,494
wasn't born anywhere near
Lake Okobogee.

66
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:52,122
- Oko-what?
- Bogee.

67
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:55,099
Okobogee.

68
00:05:56,603 --> 00:05:58,537
ls that supposed
to mean something to me?

69
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:01,073
lfyou know anything
about trout fishing

70
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:05,339
or U.F.O. hot spots.

71
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:07,403
Define hot spot.

72
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,643
Four sightings
in 1 967, August

73
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:14,881
including one by a National
Weather Service plane.

74
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:18,947
This is a light-blasted,
digitally enhanced enlargement.

75
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,856
The pilot took that photograph?

76
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,521
Try a Girl Scout
with an lnstamatic.

77
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:25,928
Four ofthe nine girls in the troop
claim to have seen something.

78
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:28,762
Five, ifyou include
the den mother.

79
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:31,769
The air force said it was a weather
balloon caught in a wind shear

80
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:33,772
but there wasn't
a weather balloon

81
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,070
launched that day
within 700 miles.

82
00:06:39,212 --> 00:06:42,579
Read me the names of
those Girl Scouts from 1 967.

83
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:48,913
Lisa Terrel, Bonnie Winston,
Doreen Mccallister, Darlene Mor--

84
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:54,851
lt's the same
Darlene Morris.

85
00:07:31,331 --> 00:07:32,491
Ms. Darlene Morris?

86
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:35,193
l'm Agent Scully,
and this is Agent Fox Mulder.

87
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:38,270
We talked with you
on the phone last night.

88
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:40,305
Please, come in.

89
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:48,046
Well, l knew that ifl screamed
loud and long enough

90
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:49,945
that someone
would listen

91
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:53,144
but l never expected
the F.B.l.

92
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:55,244
Uh, this is Kevin.

93
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:56,948
Kevin, say hi.

94
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,925
Would you like
some coffee?

95
00:08:02,996 --> 00:08:04,623
Mmm.

96
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:43,829
Some days, l can't even...

97
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:48,169
get myselfup out ofbed

98
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:52,644
and... Kevin has been acting
so strange.

99
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:54,805
l don't know what to do anymore.

100
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:57,645
l just want her back again.

101
00:08:57,717 --> 00:08:59,776
Ms. Morris

102
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:03,914
during the divorce,
was there a custody battle?

103
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,652
Charles had nothing
to do with this.

104
00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:08,591
How can you be so sure?

105
00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:12,825
Because l know what happened.

106
00:09:12,932 --> 00:09:14,866
lt'sjust like it was before.

107
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:18,199
Summer of 1 967?
The Girl Scout troop?

108
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:21,240
- How did you know?
- Your name's on record

109
00:09:21,307 --> 00:09:24,276
at the Center For U.F.O. Studies
in Evanston, lllinois.

110
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:27,142
Really?

111
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:29,147
Yeah, a pilot
for the National Weather Service

112
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:31,911
made a sighting over
the same area on the same day.

113
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:34,215
They took her,
didn't they, Mr. Mulder?

114
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:45,791
You said that Kevin was there
the night it happened?

115
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,958
He didn't see anything.
He was asleep.

116
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:50,001
Doyou think l might
talk to him anyway?

117
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:53,630
- Mmm.
- Thanks.

118
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:03,511
You know...

119
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:06,915
l've told the story
so many times now...

120
00:10:06,986 --> 00:10:09,887
Oh, to the newspapers
and the police...

121
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,055
And every time l tell it

122
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:17,426
people get this look
in their eye

123
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:19,397
just like the look

124
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:22,923
thatyou've got
right now.

125
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,973
Hey, buddy.

126
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,635
You mind ifl sit down?

127
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:34,441
Thanks.

128
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:38,117
Your mom tells me
you've been having nightmares.

129
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:39,651
l guess so.

130
00:10:39,752 --> 00:10:43,313
- You want to tell me about them?
- No.

131
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:45,323
All right.

132
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:52,463
What areyou doing?

133
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:57,899
You making something?

134
00:10:57,971 --> 00:10:59,962
Can l take a look at it?

135
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:06,673
Thanks.

136
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:13,752
lt's coming from there.

137
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:17,956
The TV?

138
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:33,062
l don't know what it is.
May be a binary sequence ofsome kind.

139
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:35,835
Could be anything,
could be nothing.

140
00:11:35,908 --> 00:11:38,399
l knowyou're busy.
Look, l know a friend

141
00:11:38,478 --> 00:11:40,446
who knows a friend
who knows a friend

142
00:11:40,513 --> 00:11:42,879
who can getyou a ticket
to a Redskins game.

143
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:45,042
You got it. All right.

144
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:49,383
You know where to find me?
Thanks, Danny.

145
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:52,982
As l was telling your partner,
we found no evidence ofkidnap.

146
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:54,993
No phone call, no ransom note

147
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:58,053
and since we didn't
turn up a body...

148
00:11:58,131 --> 00:12:00,190
You assumed
she ran away.

149
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:03,895
Well, it wouldn't be the first time
Ruby Morris ran away from home.

150
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,904
How doyou explain
what her mother saw?

151
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:11,274
l think that Darlene
has a very active imagination.

152
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:13,744
l've been listening to those
stories since the first grade.

153
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:16,314
So, basically,
you ignored her statement.

154
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:22,585
l included it in my report.

155
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,646
Butyou didn't bother
to check it out.

156
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:27,852
We went out to the campsite.
We didn't find anything.

157
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:32,057
Darlene's little girl
was no prom queen.

158
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:35,464
l can't count the number oftimes
l pulled her out ofparked cars

159
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:38,003
or found her puking her guts out
by the side ofthe road.

160
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:40,005
lt wasjust
a matter oftime before...

161
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:42,803
Before what?

162
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:46,077
Before something bad
happened to her

163
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:49,080
and if Darlene needs to make up
crazy stories to get past that, fine,

164
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:51,082
but don't tell me
to treat it as the truth.

165
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,846
l'm not going to waste my time.

166
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:57,489
l just think
it's a good idea

167
00:12:57,557 --> 00:12:59,548
not to antagonize
local law enforcement.

168
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,219
Who? Me?
l'm Mr. Congeniality.

169
00:13:02,295 --> 00:13:04,525
You never know. We might need
his help one ofthese days.

170
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:06,498
l'll send him a bundt cake.

171
00:13:45,338 --> 00:13:47,363
You're looking
for Ruby, right?

172
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,739
That's right.
Who areyou?

173
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,175
lt doesn't matter.

174
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:54,974
Areyou a friend of Ruby's?

175
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:57,606
Ruby didn't have friends.

176
00:13:57,717 --> 00:14:00,345
Shejust had people
she liked to hang with.

177
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:03,149
And she liked
to hang out with you?

178
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:06,123
l guess we had some times.

179
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:08,683
Like the night she disappeared?

180
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:11,992
lt was Greg. She was
supposed to see him that night.

181
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:13,998
Who's Greg?

182
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:16,899
Her boyfriend,
Greg Randall.

183
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:18,903
Theywere supposed to meet
up at the lake.

184
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:20,905
They had stuffto talk about.

185
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:23,464
What kind ofstuff?

186
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:26,068
Greg got Ruby pregnant.

187
00:14:26,145 --> 00:14:29,342
l don't know, whatever,
she got herselfpregnant.

188
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:32,246
Doyou know what they
were planning to do about it?

189
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,920
Theywere going to leave town.
At least, that's what Ruby told me.

190
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,084
You know Greg from school?

191
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,618
Greg? School?

192
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:46,631
l don't think so.

193
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:48,633
All he ever did
since we met him

194
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:51,693
was pour beer
at the Pennsylvania Pub.

195
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,514
Excuse me.

196
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:38,550
- Doyou know where
we could find Greg Randall?
- Who's asking?

197
00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:47,358
What kind oftrouble's
he got himselfinto now?

198
00:15:47,426 --> 00:15:50,020
Actually, we were hoping
you could tell us.

199
00:15:50,096 --> 00:15:52,394
Greg called in sick
three weeks ago, man.

200
00:15:52,465 --> 00:15:54,399
l haven't seen
or heard from him since.

201
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:57,368
Any ideas where
he might have gone?

202
00:15:57,436 --> 00:16:00,803
No, but ifyou find him,
tell him he's fired.

203
00:16:00,873 --> 00:16:04,206
This is the hotel we'll be staying at
ifyou hear ofanything.

204
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:15,420
That's a nice tattoo.
What is that?

205
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:17,386
What's it look like?

206
00:16:17,456 --> 00:16:19,720
A fying saucer.

207
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:21,851
You don't really believe
in that stuff, doyou?

208
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:24,555
l take ityou don't?

209
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:26,963
No, l think it's all
just a bunch ofcrazy people

210
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:28,466
howling at the moon.

211
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:32,163
So, you haven't been out
to Lake Okobogee, haveyou?

212
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:34,729
No, l haven't. Why?

213
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:37,503
You should ride with us
sometime.

214
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:40,204
You might see some things
that will changeyour mind.

215
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:48,018
Get a killer sunburn
in the middle ofthe night.

216
00:17:45,244 --> 00:17:46,233
Where's Mulder?

217
00:17:50,216 --> 00:17:52,844
Where did you get
the document?

218
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:56,149
lfyou explain whatyou're talking
about, maybe l can helpyou out.

219
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,094
This is a document?

220
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,532
just looks like a bunch
ofones and zeroes to me.

221
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:13,470
- Tell me whereyou got it.
- Tell me what it is.

222
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:15,473
Keep playing games

223
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,668
l'll haul your ass
up in front ofthe D-6.

224
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:20,337
You can explain to them
whatyou're doing obstructingjustice.

225
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:22,676
lt's your call, Holtzman.

226
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:24,682
Unless they tell me
otherwise

227
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,877
l'm not accountable to anybody
outside my subcommittee.

228
00:18:26,952 --> 00:18:30,615
l don't care ifit's the N.S.A.
or the Vatican Police.

229
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,293
lt's a defense satellite
transmission.

230
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:37,625
You're kidding.

231
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:39,597
just a fragment,
but highly classified.

232
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:41,895
We need to know
where it came from.

233
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:45,528
Well, sure, l'll letyou know
as soon as l find out.

234
00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:47,538
That's it, Mulder.

235
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:49,574
Youjust boughtyourself
a one-way back to Washington.

236
00:18:52,244 --> 00:18:54,212
We got it.

237
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:03,384
Great.

238
00:19:03,456 --> 00:19:05,424
What?

239
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:08,927
You shouldn't have told them.
They have nojurisdiction.

240
00:19:08,994 --> 00:19:10,757
Mulder, they're N.S.A.

241
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,129
They think the boy may be
a threat to national security.

242
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,465
How can an eight-year-old boy
who can barely multiply

243
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:19,731
be a threat
to national security?

244
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:21,739
People call me paranoid.

245
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:25,470
How did Kevin obtain
top-secret information?

246
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:27,944
Where doyou think
he got it from?

247
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:11,752
lt's okay, baby.
Don't worry.

248
00:20:11,824 --> 00:20:14,190
- lt will be okay.
- Agent: Come with me, son.

249
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,750
Mom!

250
00:20:15,828 --> 00:20:19,264
lt will be all right, baby.

251
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,323
You guys do
really delicate work.

252
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:56,835
- Let's get this to Cryptography.
- Let's go.

253
00:20:56,902 --> 00:20:59,029
Thinkwe got what we needed.
Thankyou.

254
00:21:14,253 --> 00:21:15,777
What is it?

255
00:21:15,854 --> 00:21:18,152
l'm not sure.

256
00:21:48,153 --> 00:21:50,883
We scanned all 77 pages
through the mainframe.

257
00:21:50,956 --> 00:21:53,789
And none ofthe information
is actionable.

258
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:55,793
Other than
the satellite transmission

259
00:21:55,861 --> 00:21:58,659
nothing can be construed
as a security risk.

260
00:21:58,731 --> 00:22:01,033
The boy's being released
this afternoon.

261
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,930
So it wasjust a random set
ofones and zeroes?

262
00:22:04,003 --> 00:22:06,267
On the contrary,
there was nothing random about it.

263
00:22:06,338 --> 00:22:08,431
l don't understand.

264
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:10,566
All information
can be rendered digitally

265
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:12,803
in a series ofones and zeroes.

266
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:15,379
When we downloaded the data,
we found an amazing range...

267
00:22:15,481 --> 00:22:17,915
Well, see foryourself.

268
00:22:17,983 --> 00:22:20,213
Da Vinci's UniversalMan.

269
00:22:24,056 --> 00:22:26,286
A DNA double helix.

270
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:29,957
There's lots more.

271
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:34,056
( ClassicalMusic Playing )

272
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:37,534
- That's from the Brandenberg Concertos.
- But they'rejust fragments.

273
00:22:37,603 --> 00:22:39,537
A few notes here and there

274
00:22:39,605 --> 00:22:41,732
some lines from the Koran,
a Shakespearian sonnet...

275
00:22:41,807 --> 00:22:44,367
Almost like someone
switching channels, huh?

276
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:00,825
- Mrs. Morris...
- l have nothing to say toyou.

277
00:23:00,893 --> 00:23:03,293
Mrs. Morris, please,
give me a minute to explain.

278
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:10,191
Would you pleasejust wait
right over there for Mama?

279
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:12,203
l'll be right there.

280
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:17,703
l thoughtyou were both
here to help us.

281
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,243
Scully:
This has been a terrible mistake

282
00:23:19,311 --> 00:23:21,245
and l assureyou
that the government

283
00:23:21,313 --> 00:23:23,247
will pay for all damages.

284
00:23:23,315 --> 00:23:26,113
l don't wantyour money.
l want my daughter back

285
00:23:26,185 --> 00:23:28,244
and l wantyou
to leave us alone.

286
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,084
Butyour son has seen something.

287
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:36,059
You stay away from me,
and you stay away from my child.

288
00:23:42,768 --> 00:23:44,395
Come on, honey.

289
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,462
lt's okay.
Let's go now.

290
00:24:05,357 --> 00:24:09,157
l thought we were
headed back into town.

291
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:11,492
Where are we going?

292
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:14,430
The boy's the key, Scully.
l know it.

293
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,967
The key to what?

294
00:24:16,034 --> 00:24:17,934
Finding Ruby.

295
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:20,836
Think about it
for a minute.

296
00:24:20,906 --> 00:24:22,840
This is a boywho is
receiving digitized data

297
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:24,738
from a television screen.

298
00:24:24,843 --> 00:24:27,971
Agent Atsumi said it was
a statistical aberration.

299
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:33,550
- No.
- Okay, l admit it's not much
ofan explanation...

300
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:36,986
Kevin is a conduit
ofsome kind.

301
00:24:37,055 --> 00:24:38,488
A conduit.

302
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:42,459
A link or a connection
to whoever...

303
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:45,827
orwhatever took Ruby
that night.

304
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:47,832
But how?

305
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,800
lfthere was an abduction

306
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:51,802
it's likely that Kevin
was touched in some way.

307
00:24:55,073 --> 00:24:57,007
Mulder, l know
whatyou're thinking.

308
00:25:01,413 --> 00:25:03,847
l know why
this is so important toyou.

309
00:25:06,051 --> 00:25:08,849
l know.

310
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:13,187
But there is no evidence
indicating an abduction.

311
00:25:13,258 --> 00:25:17,251
That's whywe're going
to Lake Okobogee.

312
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:24,935
According
to the police photos

313
00:25:25,003 --> 00:25:27,801
Ruby and Kevin
were sleeping right here.

314
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:30,603
just a stone's throw
from the forest wall.

315
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:32,768
Meaning what?

316
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:36,279
Meaning anybody could have
come out ofthe forest to grab her.

317
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:42,514
Haveyou noticed
the tree line?

318
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:46,046
Evidence ofextreme heat.

319
00:25:46,124 --> 00:25:49,958
Or an electrical storm.

320
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:51,928
Besides which,
there's nothing

321
00:25:51,997 --> 00:25:55,057
to connect it to the night
of Ruby's disappearance.

322
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:57,067
That's true.

323
00:26:02,174 --> 00:26:05,371
Doyou think a lightning strike
could have caused this?

324
00:26:05,477 --> 00:26:08,674
Doyou have any idea at what temperature
sand solidifies into glass?

325
00:26:09,948 --> 00:26:12,917
2,500 degrees fahrenheit.

326
00:26:12,985 --> 00:26:15,146
Something was out here,
Scully--

327
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,381
something hot enough
to turn sand into glass

328
00:26:17,456 --> 00:26:19,390
to singe those trees

329
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:21,392
and to blister the roof
ofthat camper.

330
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:34,496
( Whispering: )
Mulder...

331
00:26:34,573 --> 00:26:36,507
look.

332
00:27:17,716 --> 00:27:19,650
What is it?

333
00:27:19,718 --> 00:27:21,845
lt's a grave.

334
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,979
Shallow, by the smell ofit.

335
00:27:29,528 --> 00:27:31,519
Mulder, what areyou doing?

336
00:27:33,832 --> 00:27:36,460
Mulder, you are disturbing
a crime scene.

337
00:27:39,638 --> 00:27:41,572
Stop!

338
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:45,639
What ifit's her?

339
00:27:45,744 --> 00:27:47,803
l need to know.

340
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:09,400
You okay, Mulder?

341
00:28:09,468 --> 00:28:11,299
l'm fine.

342
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:16,469
Looks like a male caucasian.

343
00:28:23,615 --> 00:28:25,606
Sir.

344
00:28:30,422 --> 00:28:32,583
Victim's name
was Greg Randall.

345
00:28:34,326 --> 00:28:36,226
Ruby's boyfriend.

346
00:28:36,294 --> 00:28:38,660
Ruby had a lot ofboyfriends.

347
00:28:38,764 --> 00:28:40,925
Beforeyou put that away,
can l look at it?

348
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:42,500
Go right ahead.

349
00:29:18,136 --> 00:29:20,400
Look at that.

350
00:29:20,472 --> 00:29:23,373
That's her--
the girl from the library.

351
00:29:23,442 --> 00:29:25,171
Who?

352
00:29:25,243 --> 00:29:28,644
We didn't get her name, but she claimed
Greg and Ruby had run offtogether.

353
00:29:28,713 --> 00:29:30,874
Doc Fowler's
a buddy ofmine.

354
00:29:30,949 --> 00:29:32,917
Delivered both my kids.

355
00:29:32,984 --> 00:29:35,646
l can find out
who had that appointment.

356
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:56,373
Scully:
Have a seat, Tessa.

357
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:09,248
We know thatyou lied to us
the other day.

358
00:30:09,321 --> 00:30:11,812
We know thatyou
had the appointment

359
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,858
with Dr. Fowler
on August 7.

360
00:30:13,925 --> 00:30:17,258
We know thatyou're the one
that's pregnant, not Ruby.

361
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:19,297
You don't know nothing, doyou?

362
00:30:19,364 --> 00:30:21,298
We can prove it, Tessa

363
00:30:21,366 --> 00:30:24,631
and we can prove
that Greg was the father.

364
00:30:24,703 --> 00:30:27,365
So what ifhe was the father?

365
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:29,373
This is very serious.

366
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:32,310
Doyou understand
how serious this is?

367
00:30:32,444 --> 00:30:36,380
Now, you've waived
the right to an attorney.

368
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:40,043
So ifyou lie to us here today

369
00:30:40,118 --> 00:30:43,645
you could be charged
with perjury.

370
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:51,957
He promised me we'd be in L.A.
by Christmas.

371
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,295
He had
a friend there.

372
00:30:55,367 --> 00:30:57,631
And l'd never seen the ocean.

373
00:30:57,702 --> 00:31:00,535
You said that he and Ruby
were seeing each other.

374
00:31:00,605 --> 00:31:03,665
You said that theywere planning
to meet at the lake.

375
00:31:03,742 --> 00:31:05,676
ls that true?

376
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:09,009
l was nowhere near
the lake that night, okay?

377
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,980
Sureyou were, Tessa.

378
00:31:14,085 --> 00:31:17,782
You knew theywere meeting, soyou
sat there and you waited for them.

379
00:31:17,889 --> 00:31:19,823
You were angry
and you werejealous.

380
00:31:19,891 --> 00:31:22,223
- l wasn't.
- You sat there and you waited.

381
00:31:22,294 --> 00:31:24,956
When they showed, you killed him first.
lsn't that how it went?

382
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,965
- No.
- You snuck up from behind him
and you shot him in the back.

383
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:29,933
Bam!

384
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:35,196
And then you killed Ruby.
Bam!

385
00:31:38,743 --> 00:31:40,677
What was she doing right
before she died, Tessa?

386
00:31:40,745 --> 00:31:42,906
Was she pleading
for her life?

387
00:31:42,981 --> 00:31:44,676
Was she running away?

388
00:31:44,749 --> 00:31:47,240
- l didn't kill her!
- Where's she buried?

389
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:50,379
- l don't know!
- You don't know where
you buried her, Tessa?

390
00:31:50,455 --> 00:31:52,355
- l didn't kill her!
- You didn't?

391
00:31:52,457 --> 00:31:54,254
She wasn't even there
that night!

392
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,664
Well, how would you
know that, Tessa

393
00:32:00,732 --> 00:32:02,723
ifyou weren't
thereyourself?

394
00:32:09,774 --> 00:32:12,208
Mulder, you're not seeing
the whole picture.

395
00:32:12,277 --> 00:32:16,646
- Which is?
- ln all likelihood, Ruby is dead.

396
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:18,649
ls thatyour conclusion
or the conclusion

397
00:32:18,717 --> 00:32:20,651
ofthe Sioux City
Sheriffs Department?

398
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:22,653
They're searching
the national park

399
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:25,622
and a rescue dive team is coming in
from Des Moines to drag the lake.

400
00:32:25,724 --> 00:32:27,589
They're wasting their time.

401
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:30,253
Doyou really thinkTessa Sears
is telling the truth?

402
00:32:30,362 --> 00:32:33,763
Why not? What if Ruby
never did show up that night?

403
00:32:33,865 --> 00:32:37,767
She lied to us in the library
and about her pregnancy.

404
00:32:37,836 --> 00:32:40,168
What makes you think she wouldn't
lie to us about killing Ruby?

405
00:32:40,238 --> 00:32:43,765
Because something was
out there in those woods.

406
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:46,970
We have a suspect in custody.

407
00:32:47,045 --> 00:32:49,445
We have a confession
to one murder

408
00:32:49,514 --> 00:32:53,177
and we have a statement which speaks
to the intent to commit another.

409
00:32:53,251 --> 00:32:55,048
lt's over, Mulder.

410
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,578
lt's time to go home and turn this
over to local law enforcement.

411
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,157
l can't do that.

412
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:05,227
- Mulder, where areyou going?
- To talk to the boy.

413
00:33:05,297 --> 00:33:07,265
Darlene won't even
letyou in the door.

414
00:33:07,332 --> 00:33:09,232
Well, l've got to see him.

415
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:11,462
They don't want to have
anything to do with us.

416
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:14,403
Stop running afteryour sister.

417
00:33:19,244 --> 00:33:21,178
This won't bring her back.

418
00:33:21,246 --> 00:33:24,511
Come with me,
or don't come with me

419
00:33:24,582 --> 00:33:27,915
but until they find a body,
l'm not giving up on that girl.

420
00:33:40,665 --> 00:33:42,860
- ( Knocking )
- Hello?

421
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,902
Mrs. Morris?

422
00:33:48,973 --> 00:33:50,873
Kevin?

423
00:34:02,387 --> 00:34:05,481
( Teapot Whistling )

424
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:26,939
Mulder?

425
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,984
What does it mean?

426
00:34:34,052 --> 00:34:36,077
l don't know.

427
00:34:39,624 --> 00:34:41,592
l'm going to check upstairs.

428
00:34:51,836 --> 00:34:53,770
Oh, my God.

429
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:55,931
What is it?

430
00:34:56,007 --> 00:34:58,100
just come up here.

431
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:06,883
Look.

432
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,313
lt's her.
lt's Ruby.

433
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:32,237
This is a long shot.
They could be anywhere.

434
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:36,178
You know, when l was a kid

435
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:38,841
l had this ritual.

436
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:44,819
l'd close my eyes
before l walked into my room

437
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:49,019
because l thought that, one day, when
l opened them my sisterwould be there

438
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:53,723
just lying in bed,
like nothing ever happened.

439
00:35:57,135 --> 00:36:00,468
You know, l'm still
walking into that room...

440
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:02,506
every day ofmy life.

441
00:36:08,112 --> 00:36:09,670
Scully!

442
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:23,490
Darlene!

443
00:36:27,632 --> 00:36:30,726
Look. There's
a trail head.

444
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:38,374
( WomanScreaming )

445
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:46,041
( Panting )

446
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:50,719
- Areyou okay?
- lt's here.

447
00:36:50,788 --> 00:36:52,722
- l saw it.
- Where's Kevin?

448
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,486
- l couldn't keep up with him.
- Go ahead.

449
00:37:08,573 --> 00:37:10,905
Kevin!

450
00:37:57,855 --> 00:38:01,484
- Areyou okay?
- She's back.

451
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,493
Kevin, l'm sorry, but...

452
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:06,291
She's here.
l know it.

453
00:38:06,364 --> 00:38:08,491
Kevin, l don't
think she is.

454
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:10,500
l know how much you
wanted it to be her.

455
00:38:10,568 --> 00:38:12,832
- l did too.
- Scully: Mulder!

456
00:38:12,904 --> 00:38:14,895
Come on.

457
00:38:16,975 --> 00:38:18,966
Scully!

458
00:38:23,014 --> 00:38:24,709
Ruby!

459
00:38:24,782 --> 00:38:26,875
She's unconscious,
but she's still alive.

460
00:38:26,985 --> 00:38:29,453
l'll get help.

461
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:39,629
The nurse says she's been awake
for almost an hour.

462
00:38:39,697 --> 00:38:41,722
Any ideas
what caused the coma?

463
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:43,733
There's no sign
ofhead trauma.

464
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:46,497
No narcotic traces,
or electrolyte abnormalities

465
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:50,132
except herwhite blood cell
count was sky-high.

466
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:53,200
Was there a reduction
in the lymphocyte population

467
00:38:53,277 --> 00:38:55,268
or release
ofglucocorticoids?

468
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:57,041
Um...

469
00:38:57,115 --> 00:38:59,049
Actually, both.

470
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,947
How did you know that?

471
00:39:01,085 --> 00:39:03,747
They're symptoms ofprolonged
weightlessness.

472
00:39:03,855 --> 00:39:07,814
Shuttle astronauts have reported
similar imbalances.

473
00:39:31,249 --> 00:39:34,047
Hi, Ruby.

474
00:39:34,152 --> 00:39:36,677
Who areyou?

475
00:39:36,788 --> 00:39:38,847
We're with the F.B.l.

476
00:39:38,956 --> 00:39:42,323
l'm Special Agent Dana Scully,
and this is Fox Mulder.

477
00:39:45,363 --> 00:39:47,388
My mom said you might
be coming by.

478
00:39:47,465 --> 00:39:49,524
How areyou feeling?

479
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,227
( Sighing )

480
00:39:51,302 --> 00:39:53,293
Fine, l guess.

481
00:39:53,371 --> 00:39:55,305
Where were
you, Ruby?

482
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:57,068
Can you tell us?

483
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,910
Kevin:
lt's okay, Ruby.

484
00:40:00,978 --> 00:40:02,741
He knows.

485
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:07,417
l'm not supposed to tell.

486
00:40:07,518 --> 00:40:10,453
They told me not to say.

487
00:40:10,521 --> 00:40:11,749
Who told you?

488
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:17,090
Ruby, who told you?

489
00:40:17,161 --> 00:40:19,493
Darlene:
Sweetheart,

490
00:40:19,564 --> 00:40:22,328
you don't have
to say anything.

491
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,595
You're right.

492
00:40:24,669 --> 00:40:28,002
We should wait till
Ruby gets a little stronger.

493
00:40:28,072 --> 00:40:30,506
Could we speak outside
for a moment?

494
00:40:42,754 --> 00:40:45,655
l think that it's best that
we put all ofthis behind us.

495
00:40:45,723 --> 00:40:48,886
Hasn't Ruby been through
enough already?

496
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,690
l know how disoriented
she must seem right now

497
00:40:51,763 --> 00:40:53,890
but in a couple ofweeks,
maybe even a few days...

498
00:40:53,965 --> 00:40:56,832
l don't want her
talking toyou or anyone.

499
00:40:56,901 --> 00:40:59,631
She should be encouraged
to tell her story.

500
00:40:59,704 --> 00:41:02,298
lt's important thatyou let her.

501
00:41:02,373 --> 00:41:04,170
lmportant to who?

502
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,738
l have my daughter back.
l don't want any more trouble.

503
00:41:08,813 --> 00:41:10,747
Besides,
she hardly remembers anything.

504
00:41:10,815 --> 00:41:15,115
She will remember one day,
even ifit's only in dreams.

505
00:41:15,219 --> 00:41:19,087
And when she does, she's going
to need to talk about it.

506
00:41:19,157 --> 00:41:21,091
Like l did?

507
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:25,556
Listen to me.
All ofmy life

508
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,723
l have been ridiculed
for speaking my mind.

509
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:29,994
But it was the truth, Darlene.

510
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:32,934
The truth has caused me
nothing but heartache.

511
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:34,938
l don't want
the same thing for her.

512
00:41:35,006 --> 00:41:37,702
lt doesn't have to be
that way for Ruby.

513
00:41:37,775 --> 00:41:41,267
As far as l'm concerned

514
00:41:41,345 --> 00:41:44,212
she spent the last month on
the back ofa Harley-Davidson.

515
00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:46,944
ls that whatyou're going
to tell Kevin?

516
00:41:48,586 --> 00:41:50,520
l'm sorry.

517
00:42:23,087 --> 00:42:25,021
Werber:
Butyour eyes are open?

518
00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:27,023
Mulder:
Yeah, they're open.

519
00:42:27,091 --> 00:42:28,956
But it's like nothing's
happening.

520
00:42:29,026 --> 00:42:30,857
Try turning your head.

521
00:42:30,928 --> 00:42:33,123
l can't.

522
00:42:33,197 --> 00:42:34,630
Why not?

523
00:42:34,699 --> 00:42:37,065
l don't know.

524
00:42:37,134 --> 00:42:39,159
l can't move.

525
00:42:39,237 --> 00:42:41,967
So l don't.

526
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:45,440
