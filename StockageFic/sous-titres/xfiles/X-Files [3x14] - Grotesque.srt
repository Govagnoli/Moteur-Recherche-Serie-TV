1
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:44,046
All right, everyone.
We've run out of time.

2
00:01:47,164 --> 00:01:48,183
That's all for tonight.
If you haven't finished,

3
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:59,846
you'll have more time
with Peter next week.

4
00:02:04,686 --> 00:02:10,645
- Hey, man !
- Excuse me.

5
00:03:32,396 --> 00:03:34,956
- F.B.I. !
- Stay where you are !

6
00:03:35,935 --> 00:03:38,896
- Keep the light on him !
-John Mostow, we have a warrant
for your arrest.

7
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,798
- You have the right to remain silent.
- [ Mostow Yelling ]

8
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:43,110
If you give up that right, anything you
say can and will be used against you.

9
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:49,175
- You have the right to an attorney.
- You're hurting me !

10
00:03:49,237 --> 00:03:49,802
Do you understand each of these rights
that I have explained to you ?

11
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:53,123
Do you wish to give up your right
to remain silent ? Aah !

12
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:59,472
God ! He bit me. The son of a bitch
bit me like a dog !

13
00:03:59,546 --> 00:04:07,099
- Get him out of here !
- You okay ?
- Yeah, yeah.

14
00:04:12,586 --> 00:05:40,490
My God.

15
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,461
[Mulder]John Mostow.
Unemployed housepainter.

16
00:05:45,526 --> 00:05:47,456
Divorced. No children.

17
00:05:48,372 --> 00:05:49,067
He came to the U.S. from Uzbekistan
during perestroika.

18
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,000
He failed to mention
on his I.N.S. application...

19
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,519
that he spent the better part
of his 20s in an insane asylum.

20
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,000
He was arrested last week for the
serial murders of at least seven men.

21
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:03,230
You thought all they produced
were great hockey players.

22
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:04,370
The crimes took place
during a three-year period.
All the victims male, age 17to25.

23
00:06:08,463 --> 00:06:10,052
Was there a signature
or a defining M.O. ?

24
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:13,413
Well, according to the M.E., there
was no evidence of any sexual assault.

25
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:16,988
Death was caused by massive blood loss
due to facial mutilation.

26
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:21,081
He also reported that the wound pattern
on all the victims was identical.

27
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:24,648
- It's all there on page three.
- [Flipping Pages]

28
00:06:25,891 --> 00:06:27,038
" Both eyes punctured.

29
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,406
Signature gashes from the corners
of the mouth to the ears."

30
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:34,995
The level of violence
and overkill here...

31
00:06:36,072 --> 00:06:36,463
would suggest the work
of a very angry individual.

32
00:06:38,824 --> 00:06:39,685
Or individuals,

33
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:44,697
if you count the spirit Mostow says
possessed him during the murders.

34
00:06:44,812 --> 00:06:49,130
Possession is a common claim
by criminals who have
dissociative disorders.

35
00:06:49,223 --> 00:06:51,302
It's how they distance themselves
from their actions.

36
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:55,625
That was the operational opinion until
last night, when a 1 9-year-old male...

37
00:06:55,958 --> 00:07:00,687
was found dead six miles from here
with an identical set of facial wounds.

38
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,077
- A copycat ?
- According to
Assistant Director Skinner,

39
00:07:03,016 --> 00:07:07,425
who asked us to look into this,
the details of the mutilations
were never released.

40
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,369
Only members of the crime team
would have had that information.

41
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:22,338
And Mostow's been
in custody for five days.

42
00:07:22,516 --> 00:07:27,579
Ah. Please !
The light hurts my eyes.

43
00:07:34,023 --> 00:07:35,750
Leave me alone.

44
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:38,896
You have a nice, soft bunk.
Why aren’t you using it ?

45
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:41,750
'Cause
he's been working--

46
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:47,990
haven’t you,
john ?

47
00:07:48,065 --> 00:07:53,791
What is it ?
What is this thing ?

48
00:07:53,913 --> 00:07:57,226
- It killed those men.
- Does it have a name ?

49
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,473
- Does it have a name
to go with that face ?
- All men know its name.

50
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,088
What do you call it ?
Satan ? The devil ?

51
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:09,250
- Or maybe it’s just the name
of your accomplice.
- I had no accomplice.

52
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:11,454
You killed all those
young men yourself?

53
00:08:11,502 --> 00:08:14,295
It killed them. How many times
do I have to tell you ?

54
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:17,516
Well, its fingerprints weren't
on the murder weapon. Yours were.

55
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:20,526
And it won't be tried for seven murders
under the death penalty.

56
00:08:20,572 --> 00:08:26,050
Which is why it laughs
at fools like you.

57
00:08:26,226 --> 00:08:28,103
And you.

58
00:08:28,146 --> 00:08:30,423
Fools who would pretend...

59
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:32,145
evil can be brought to heel
like a brindle bitch...

60
00:08:34,135 --> 00:08:38,520
or be held
by your pathetic gulags,

61
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:42,033
while, with a snap
of its finger,

62
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:46,942
it makes men
lick the greasy foor of hell...

63
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,955
just to see
its refection.

64
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,076
Is that what it
did last night, John ?

65
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:55,681
Snapped its fingers
and let another young man die ?

66
00:08:55,727 --> 00:09:02,668
It killed again ?
Yesterday ?

67
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:07,259
It's found somebody.
Somebody new.

68
00:09:07,491 --> 00:09:09,214
just like it found me.

69
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:19,669
Agent Mulder,
can I see you two outside ?

70
00:09:31,682 --> 00:09:36,039
So what is it, Mulder ? Little green
men ? Evil spirits ? Hounds of hell ?

71
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,953
Scully, this is Bill Patterson.
He runs the investigative
Support Unit out of Quantico.

72
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:42,979
I know. Behavioral Science.
You wrote the book. It's an honor, sir.

73
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:47,532
Is that
what you think too ?

74
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:50,785
That the suspect is possessed by
some dark spirit ?

75
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,698
No. Not at all, sir.

76
00:09:53,831 --> 00:09:56,432
- Strange company you keep, then.
- [ Sighs ]

77
00:09:56,554 --> 00:10:00,046
That's what always
amazed me about you, Bill--
how you never fit your own profile.

78
00:10:00,124 --> 00:10:04,924
No one would ever guess
how really mean-spirited you are.

79
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:10,190
The arrest of John Mostow is the result
of three years of hard work by my unit.

80
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,076
Three years.

81
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,113
You can imagine that we were awful upset
by this latest murder...

82
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:19,053
and by the suspect
floating this possession theory.

83
00:10:19,124 --> 00:10:20,381
You think he's
got an accomplice, then,

84
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,082
even though your own profile
of Mostow says that he's
most certainly working alone.

85
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:28,461
My profile led to his arrest.
No. He acted alone.

86
00:10:30,321 --> 00:10:35,153
And that murder last night was done by
a second killer, and he acted alone too.

87
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:36,105
What about these drawings of Mostow's ?
These gargoyles ?

88
00:10:39,461 --> 00:10:40,597
- You know why he draws those ?
Did you ask him ?
- I didn't get a chance to.

89
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:44,216
He says he draws them
to keep this demon of his away.

90
00:10:46,676 --> 00:10:49,570
That would make sense.
Historically, that's what
gargoyles have been used for--

91
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:51,815
to ward off evil spirits, like on the
eaves of Chartres and Notre Dame.

92
00:10:53,264 --> 00:10:54,996
I don't need
a history lesson.

93
00:10:55,023 --> 00:10:58,239
And I don't need anyone
indulging this guy's story.

94
00:10:58,304 --> 00:11:00,682
I was asked
to look into this case.

95
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:15,365
If you’ve got a problem with that,
you take it up with A.D. Skinner.

96
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,230
So you’re not gonna tell me when your
love affair with Patterson ended ?

97
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:22,875
- Patterson never liked me.
- I thought you were the
fair-haired boy when you joined.

98
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:27,035
- Not by Patterson.
- Why not ?

99
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:29,181
Didn't wanna
get my knees dirty.

100
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:32,653
Couldn't quite cast myself in the role
of the dutiful student.

101
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,519
- You mean you couldn't worship him.
- Something like that. Yeah.

102
00:11:36,582 --> 00:11:39,421
Well, from what I hear,
there were a lot of men who did.

103
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:43,038
A lot of men joined the F.B.I.
because they wanted to be him.

104
00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:47,552
Yeah. Patterson had this saying
about tracking a killer:

105
00:11:47,614 --> 00:11:51,191
If you wanted to know an artist,
you had to look at his art.

106
00:11:51,335 --> 00:12:06,142
What he really meant was if
you wanted to catch a monster,
you had to become one yourself.

107
00:12:06,532 --> 00:12:19,923
[Scully] in this case, I’d say
it served him pretty well.

108
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,432
This guy is definitely
some kind of monster.

109
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:32,184
- It’s just a cat.

110
00:12:32,948 --> 00:12:38,761
I thought it was one
of these pictures coming to life.

111
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:44,014
Our guys must've
locked it in here.

112
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:54,544
Psst, psst. No. He's obviously
got his own key to the place.

113
00:12:54,669 --> 00:12:57,894
There's air
coming through here.

114
00:12:57,971 --> 00:13:03,177
Must be something on the other side
of the wall.

115
00:13:22,264 --> 00:13:27,844
I've got some light.

116
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:37,499
See anything ?

117
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:42,279
More gargoyles, Scully.
Lots of 'em.

118
00:13:44,422 --> 00:13:46,225
Sculpted in clay.

119
00:13:46,264 --> 00:13:57,402
Why would he keep 'em
in a secret room ?

120
00:13:57,702 --> 00:14:01,874
Mulder?

121
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:03,932
Mulder, what is it ?

122
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:10,860
What do you see ?

123
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:15,649
Mulder.

124
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:32,908
Can you tell me
what's going on in there ?

125
00:15:22,981 --> 00:15:24,990
- [Woman] We're monitoring him
very closely, Agent Nemhauser,

126
00:15:25,048 --> 00:15:27,966
but I'm not too encouraged
by what I'm seeing.

127
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:31,648
- The man is lucky to be alive.
- Thank you, Doctor. Agent Scully.

128
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,975
We've turned Mostow's studio
upside down. There don't appear
to be any more bodies.

129
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,291
- How many were recovered ?
- Five. All of them dismembered.

130
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,152
All young men whose faces
were mutilated--just like
the latest victim, I hear.

131
00:15:43,178 --> 00:15:45,754
At least
this one's still alive.

132
00:15:45,826 --> 00:15:50,571
Same signature facial mutilation, right
down to the weapon, by the look of it.

133
00:15:50,687 --> 00:15:53,364
- What does Patterson have to say ?
- I haven't spoken with him yet,

134
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,645
but I bet he's gonna come to the idea
it's someone working with Mostow.

135
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:59,982
Well, I'd have to agree
with that theory.

136
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:02,674
What's Agent Mulder think ?

137
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:07,602
He thinks our finding Mostow's
secret gallery isn't gonna do
him any favors with Patterson.

138
00:16:07,823 --> 00:16:13,238
Between you and me, I think
Patterson went to Skinner and
requested Mulder on this case.

139
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,523
- He requested him ?
- I've been working with Patterson
for three years on this,

140
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,958
and this just about killed him,
until we finally got a break
and arrested Mostow.

141
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:24,461
But then this first copycat murder
really threw him for a loss.

142
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,576
Mulder's under the impression
that Patterson never
thought too highly of him.

143
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,873
That’s just Patterson.
Late night, a couple of beers in him,

144
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:39,748
he starts telling me Mulder stories,
how he's some kind of crack genius.

145
00:16:39,988 --> 00:16:44,366
- Stitches. What happened ?
- Tsk. Mostow bit me during the arrest.

146
00:16:44,484 --> 00:16:45,019
How's our victim ? Has he been able
to I.D. his attacker?

147
00:16:48,147 --> 00:16:49,982
Doctors say it's still too early to
even try-- not in the condition he's in.

148
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:54,894
- [ Gurgling ]
- They're not even sure
if he's gonna make it.

149
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:59,522
- Where's Mulder ?
- He was gonna go see
about those drawings of Mostow's.

150
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:02,767
- What's he looking for ?
- I think the same thing you are, sir:
a second killer.

151
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:11,704
- I think you should take
this conversation outside.

152
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:22,236
 Stay with us.

153
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:25,423
[Mulder Thinking] The name
is from the French "gargouille"--

154
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,023
the name of a medieval dragon
which prowled the river Seine,

155
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:31,946
whose horrible image
became a symbol of the souls of
the condemned turned to stone...

156
00:17:33,972 --> 00:17:35,426
or of the devils and demons of
the underworld spared eternal damnation.

157
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:40,193
The embodiment of the lesser forces
of the universe...

158
00:17:40,945 --> 00:17:44,366
who inspired dread and the threat
of our own damnation.

159
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:49,256
Ushers into hell or into the realm
of our own dark fears and imagination.

160
00:17:49,472 --> 00:17:52,777
For over 1,200years, the grotesque
image has found its expression...

161
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,442
in stone, clay, wood,
oil, and charcoal--

162
00:17:56,656 --> 00:18:00,055
born again and again, as if
resurrecting it self by its own will...

163
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:02,092
through tortured
human expression.

164
00:18:02,185 --> 00:18:04,232
Almost as if it existed,

165
00:18:04,278 --> 00:18:09,122
haunting men inwardly so that it
might haunt mankind for eternity...

166
00:18:09,243 --> 00:18:11,917
as it must've
haunted John Mostow.

167
00:18:12,037 --> 00:18:17,143
But what impulses
moved him to kill ? Could this
be the same dark force at work,

168
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:20,539
its ultimate expression
the destruction of the flesh,

169
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:23,838
of the very hand
that creates it ?

170
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,343
Is this evil something
born in each of us,

171
00:18:26,414 --> 00:18:29,900
crouching in the shadow
of every human soul, waiting to emerge,

172
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,161
a monster that violates our bodies
and twists our will to do its bidding ?

173
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:42,664
Is this the monster called madness ?

174
00:18:43,124 --> 00:18:44,184
They're closing up in a few minutes.

175
00:18:48,263 --> 00:18:49,058
So, is this how you’re looking
for the second killer ?

176
00:18:51,644 --> 00:18:56,387
Tell me, Mulder, what do you really
expect to find here ?

177
00:18:56,652 --> 00:18:58,248
I'm not sure yet.

178
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,185
But you must have some idea,
some kind of theory.

179
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,758
I've got a few theories. I'm trying
to stitch them together right now.

180
00:19:05,282 --> 00:19:08,398
- With your face
stuck in a library book ?
- You said it yourself.

181
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,023
If you want to know the artist,
look at the art.

182
00:19:11,114 --> 00:19:12,180
- I'm finally agreeing with you.
- I know where you’re going
with this, Mulder,

183
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:15,772
because I've been there myself-- so I
can tell you you're wasting your time.

184
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:21,728
Maybe you could tell me
why this man was compelled to draw...

185
00:19:21,808 --> 00:19:23,980
and sculpt the same face again
and again, why he's still doing it now.

186
00:19:25,067 --> 00:19:29,184
Because he's insane. This is nothing
but the scrawling of a madman.

187
00:19:29,356 --> 00:19:29,892
He said this thing wants
to see its own refection.

188
00:19:32,173 --> 00:19:33,569
Mostow has said everything
but what I need to hear--
the name of his accomplice.

189
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:38,521
- Unless he's telling the truth.
- About being possessed ?

190
00:19:43,626 --> 00:19:43,999
I have to tell you.
I am really disappointed in you.

191
00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:46,819
Well, I wouldn't want to disappoint you
by not disappointing you.

192
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:49,953
After all this time,
I thought maybe you'd finally
put your feet on the ground.

193
00:19:54,891 --> 00:20:11,217
Clearly, I was mistaken.

194
00:20:29,673 --> 00:20:35,953
Mulder? Mulder, it’s me.

195
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:48,559
Mulder ?

196
00:23:53,022 --> 00:23:53,499
You weren't at home, in your office.

197
00:23:55,313 --> 00:23:57,776
I was scared, Mulder.
I didn't know where you were.

198
00:23:57,855 --> 00:24:01,083
I kept trying your cell phone,
but you didn't answer.

199
00:24:01,192 --> 00:24:03,903
It was turned off.

200
00:24:03,988 --> 00:24:08,163
You turned your phone off ?
Why do you even bother carrying it ?

201
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:11,876
You're all set. You'll want to see
a doctor tomorrow in case of infection.

202
00:24:11,955 --> 00:24:14,938
- Thanks.
- [Man] Sure.

203
00:24:15,048 --> 00:24:17,940
Mulder, you still haven't told me what
you were doing in Mostow's studio.

204
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:18,957
- I was working.
- At 3:30 in the morning ?

205
00:24:20,781 --> 00:24:22,790
Mulder, I haven't seen or spoken
to you in almost two days now.

206
00:24:23,865 --> 00:24:26,270
- You haven't been
returning my phone calls.
- This thing exists. It's real.

207
00:24:27,194 --> 00:24:28,856
"It" ?
What are you talking about ?

208
00:24:28,905 --> 00:24:32,488
-Whatever keeps killing those young men.
-Mostow killed those men,

209
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,248
and out of some sick alliance,
some other person is continuing
where he left off.

210
00:24:36,365 --> 00:24:41,784
- Whatever attacked me wasn't a person.
- Well, did you actually see it ?

211
00:24:41,971 --> 00:24:44,565
Mulder, maybe you've just seen
what you want to see.

212
00:24:44,596 --> 00:24:48,578
What makes you think
I would want to see that ?

213
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,656
I didn't imagine it,
Scully.

214
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,884
Listen to yourself, Mulder.
Listen to what you’re saying.

215
00:24:53,941 --> 00:24:55,867
You're starting to sound like M--

216
00:24:58,003 --> 00:24:59,011
Look, when I couldn't reach you,
I went to your apartment.

217
00:25:02,057 --> 00:25:02,719
I saw your new wallpaper.

218
00:25:05,252 --> 00:25:09,239
Don’t you realize what is happening
here, Mulder ? He is testing you.

219
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,445
He is the reason you were brought
on this case in the first place.

220
00:25:12,824 --> 00:25:13,808
- Patterson ?

221
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:20,044
He requested your involvement
through Skinner's office.
I checked that 302 myself.

222
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,647
Mulder,
where are you going ?

223
00:25:40,801 --> 00:25:41,113
So, how's
Mulder holding up ?

224
00:25:42,847 --> 00:25:43,219
- Sir, can I have a minute ?
- Of course.

225
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:45,863
In private.

226
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:54,380
- What's this about ?
- Maybe you can tell me.

227
00:25:54,527 --> 00:25:57,106
I'm curious about what you’re doing
concerning Agent Mulder.

228
00:25:57,173 --> 00:25:59,487
- I'm afraid I don't know
what you’re referring to.
- I think you do, sir.

229
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:05,232
I think you knew exactly how
Agent Mulder would respond when
you brought him on this case.

230
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:07,451
You did request him,
didn’t you ?

231
00:26:07,511 --> 00:26:11,782
If you’re concerned about
Agent Mulder's conduct or behavior,

232
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,054
maybe you should
take that up with him.

233
00:26:13,617 --> 00:26:17,317
- You know I already have.
- Then what do you expect me to do ?

234
00:26:17,394 --> 00:26:20,541
I want you to be honest with me
about what you’re trying to do.

235
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:24,682
Is this some kind of payback for
what happened eight years ago,
because Mulder quit the I.S.U. ?

236
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:30,679
- My motivations aren't that petty.
- Then why ?

237
00:26:30,817 --> 00:26:35,007
I asked for Mulder
because...

238
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:37,339
I wanna close the book on this
godforsaken case once and for all.

239
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:43,351
And you knew that he could
help you solve it.

240
00:26:43,484 --> 00:26:47,009
My advice to you,
Scully:

241
00:26:47,037 --> 00:26:47,488
Let Mulder do
what he has to do.

242
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:56,675
Don't get in his way
and don't try to hold him back...

243
00:26:56,926 --> 00:27:08,830
because you won't
be able to.

244
00:28:35,571 --> 00:28:39,276
Why didn't it kill me
like it killed the others ?

245
00:28:40,403 --> 00:28:43,093
Why did it let me live ?

246
00:28:43,142 --> 00:28:47,412
Even if I could tell you why,
you would not understand.

247
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:52,674
Then help me
to understand, John.

248
00:28:52,727 --> 00:28:56,233
- Please. Go away.
- No.

249
00:28:56,432 --> 00:29:00,490
You have to help me go deeper,
help me get inside its head...

250
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:01,259
Like it got inside yours, so
I can understand what it wants.

251
00:29:08,856 --> 00:29:09,970
You have felt its hunger,

252
00:29:11,711 --> 00:29:16,090
felt your bones rattled
by its frozen breath.

253
00:29:16,178 --> 00:29:16,772
So you know...
nothing can be done.

254
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,989
- Unless I find it.
- Then what will you do ?

255
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:26,872
-Just tell me how to find it, John.
- No.

256
00:29:29,082 --> 00:29:30,517
just tell me
how to find this thing.

257
00:29:32,451 --> 00:29:34,375
You can't find it.

258
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:44,894
Only it can find you.

259
00:29:48,732 --> 00:29:49,796
Maybe...

260
00:29:51,765 --> 00:29:52,784
it already has.

261
00:30:03,175 --> 00:30:07,087
First time up, I struck out.
All three pieces were clean.

262
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:08,114
But on my second try,
I got lucky.

263
00:30:10,865 --> 00:30:13,578
- I dusted the blade with red wop.
- I'm sorry ?

264
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:19,829
" Powder" spelled backwards. It's
what we call the fluorescent lycopodium.

265
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,663
Ah. Looks like a partial index.

266
00:30:25,806 --> 00:30:27,954
And on the left half of the handle,
almost a full thumb.

267
00:30:29,163 --> 00:30:29,230
It's the placement
of the prints that struck me.

268
00:30:31,737 --> 00:30:32,615
Not oriented where someone
would have gripped the knife.

269
00:30:34,345 --> 00:30:35,419
Which is why I thought I had your guy,
except I wasn't as lucky as I thought.

270
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:38,857
I ran the prints
against the N.C.I.C. database.

271
00:30:41,834 --> 00:30:42,509
- Your message said
that you identified them.
- I did.

272
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:45,615
- Turns out, he's one of our own people.
- An F.B.I. agent ?

273
00:30:48,355 --> 00:30:50,170
- Your partner.
- These are Mulder's prints ?

274
00:30:51,936 --> 00:30:52,547
- Are you sure ?
- I double-checked. Why ?

275
00:30:57,077 --> 00:31:01,530
I assumed he must've been the one that
recovered the knife at the crime scene.

276
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:13,398
Excuse me.

277
00:31:14,494 --> 00:31:15,450
- There's that table up front.
- That's okay.
You can put it on the foor.

278
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:20,018
I need to get that.

279
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:26,576
Evidence room.

280
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:32,546
Yes, she is.

281
00:31:36,657 --> 00:31:53,288
Excuse me, Agent Scully.
Assistant Director Skinner's
asked to see you right away.

282
00:31:53,435 --> 00:31:59,076
Come in.

283
00:31:59,269 --> 00:32:00,823
- You wanted to see me, sir ?
- Yes. Sit down.

284
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:07,827
I heard they found you
in Evidence looking for the
weapon in this Mostow case ?

285
00:32:12,755 --> 00:32:14,461
- Yes, sir.
- Did you find it ?

286
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,324
No, sir.

287
00:32:17,358 --> 00:32:18,888
Is it your opinion
the missing evidence...

288
00:32:18,945 --> 00:32:22,530
is the same weapon you found
at the crime scene earlier today ?

289
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:25,598
I'm not absolutely certain.

290
00:32:25,765 --> 00:32:29,251
But Agent Mulder's prints
were found on it.

291
00:32:29,932 --> 00:32:31,357
Yes, sir.

292
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:34,487
- Have you seen Agent Mulder
or spoken to him about this ?
- No, sir.

293
00:32:38,221 --> 00:32:39,786
Do you have any insight
into Agent Mulder's current
disposition or mental state ?

294
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:43,674
I know Agent Mulder is
working very hard on this case
at your request, sir.

295
00:32:48,661 --> 00:32:50,328
Are you worried about him,
Agent Scully ?

296
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:53,638
No, sir.

297
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:58,286
Off the record.

298
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:10,977
So am l.

299
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:20,918
Yeah. This is Greg Nemhauser.
Please call me right away at 555-0143.

300
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,791
- I need to talk to you
right away about a po--
- [Dial Tone]

301
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:02,610
- Hello ?
- Mulder ?

302
00:37:02,835 --> 00:37:05,385
- Scully ?
- Where are you ?

303
00:37:05,436 --> 00:37:08,793
- I'm in Mostow's studio.
- Are you with Nemhauser ?

304
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,846
No. Should I be ?

305
00:37:11,998 --> 00:37:14,206
That's who I was calling. He left
his number on my answering machine.

306
00:37:15,135 --> 00:37:17,016
He said
he had to talk to me.

307
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,744
- Mulder ?
- Yeah ?

308
00:37:19,768 --> 00:37:24,085
Do you know
where he is ?

309
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:29,032
I'm not sure.

310
00:37:29,262 --> 00:37:32,260
Mulder, that knife that
we recovered from the crime scene--

311
00:37:32,387 --> 00:37:34,505
I think it's the same one
that Mostow used.

312
00:37:34,614 --> 00:37:39,329
- What makes you say that ?
- Because Mostow's was stolen
from Evidence.

313
00:37:39,496 --> 00:37:43,344
- When ?
- I was hoping maybe you could tell me.

314
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:47,132
Your prints
were all over it.

315
00:37:47,215 --> 00:37:51,050
Yes, I examined Mostow's knife
yesterday in the evidence room.

316
00:37:51,085 --> 00:37:54,686
- Why ?
- Because I wanted to hold it.

317
00:37:54,786 --> 00:37:57,730
I wanted to see what it felt like
in my hand.

318
00:37:57,844 --> 00:38:02,663
- But why ?
- Look, Scully, I didn't take it.

319
00:38:02,811 --> 00:38:03,195
Okay, Mulder,
listen to me carefully.

320
00:38:05,762 --> 00:38:06,867
I want you to stay
exactly where you are. I'm
gonna be there in a few minutes,

321
00:38:10,335 --> 00:38:16,427
and we're gonna work
this thing out together, okay ?

322
00:38:16,717 --> 00:38:42,597
- Mulder ?
- Yeah.

323
00:38:56,356 --> 00:39:00,735
- Mulder.
- What are you doing here ?

324
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:01,778
What are
you doing here ?

325
00:39:02,978 --> 00:39:14,577
It's Nemhauser.

326
00:39:15,043 --> 00:39:16,045
- But you already knew that,
didn’t you ?
- What is this ?

327
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:19,414
You killed him, Bill.

328
00:39:20,969 --> 00:39:21,541
When he suspected it was you,
you killed him.

329
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:29,226
- Are you out of your mind ?
- Not me. Not now.

330
00:39:29,394 --> 00:39:31,646
- Put that gun down.
- Not until you tell me
what you’re doing here.

331
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:32,789
What I'm doing he--

332
00:39:39,302 --> 00:39:40,666
Look at your hands.

333
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:52,918
Now ask yourself
what you’re doing here.

334
00:39:52,985 --> 00:39:54,182
I'm not sure.

335
00:39:54,231 --> 00:39:57,791
You're here because John Mostow
stole three years of your life.

336
00:39:57,931 --> 00:40:01,367
Every day and every night
for three years you lived
and dreamed the horror show...

337
00:40:01,487 --> 00:40:02,141
that was in his head,
and I'm sorry.

338
00:40:04,143 --> 00:40:07,108
Imagining everything
he imagined.

339
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:08,628
Sinking deeper and deeper
into the ugliness, just like
you taught us to do.

340
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:15,052
But when you finally caught him, it
didn’t just go away, all that violence.

341
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,527
It stayed alive inside you
'til it had to come out.

342
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:22,516
But you didn't want to do what
you were doing. You wanted
to stop, but you couldn't.

343
00:40:22,704 --> 00:40:27,693
Not by yourself. That's why you
called on me in the first place,
why you couldn't kill me.

344
00:40:27,831 --> 00:40:31,152
- Mulder, what are you doing ?
- Scully, get that light off me.

345
00:40:32,028 --> 00:40:32,820
- First put the gun down !
- You don't understand !

346
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:40,414
Help me understand why you have a gun
on Agent Patterson.

347
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,248
It's him, Scully.

348
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:24,992
Mulder !

349
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:34,186
You okay, Mulder ?

350
00:42:48,545 --> 00:42:56,478
You should call an ambulance.
His pulse is still strong.

351
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,655
This is Agent Mulder with the F.B.I.

352
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:09,534
I have a man down
with a gunshot wound.

353
00:43:09,893 --> 00:43:11,355
Oh, God! God!

354
00:43:16,134 --> 00:43:19,818
Are you listening to me ?
For God sakes !

355
00:43:19,865 --> 00:43:22,909
Isn't someone listening
to me ?

356
00:43:23,016 --> 00:43:29,262
I didn't do it. It wasn't me !
I didn't kill them !

357
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:32,056
Please!

358
00:43:32,146 --> 00:43:32,706
We work in the dark.

359
00:43:34,003 --> 00:43:35,088
We do what we can to battle the evil
that would otherwise destroy us.

360
00:43:38,684 --> 00:43:40,358
But if a man's character
is his fate,

361
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:43,094
this fight is not a choice,
but a calling.

362
00:43:43,155 --> 00:43:46,157
Yet sometimes the weight
of this burden causes us to falter,

363
00:43:46,233 --> 00:43:48,882
reaching the fragile fortress
of our mind,

364
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:49,724
allowing the monsters without
to turn within.

365
00:43:52,173 --> 00:43:54,137
And we are left alone
staring into the abyss...

366
00:43:56,027 --> 00:43:58,157
into the laughing face
of madness.
