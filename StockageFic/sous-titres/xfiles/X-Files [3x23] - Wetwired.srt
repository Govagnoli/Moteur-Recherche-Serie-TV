saw this war criminal on television,

he was somehow inspired to go out

that the programs that Patnik watched...

your work ?

492
00:43:05,696 --> 00:43:08,062
All the personnel
and hardware have been removed.

493
00:43:08,132 --> 00:43:10,259
But Mulder still has
one of the devices.

494
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:12,268
Well, it proves nothing.

495
00:43:13,504 --> 00:43:16,701
What about, uh,
Mulder's source ?

496
00:43:16,774 --> 00:43:19,368
He's been eliminated.

497
00:43:19,443 --> 00:43:21,911
And his source ?

498
00:43:23,247 --> 00:43:25,875
Who's he working with ?

499
00:43:25,983 --> 00:43:28,417
That person remains unknown.
