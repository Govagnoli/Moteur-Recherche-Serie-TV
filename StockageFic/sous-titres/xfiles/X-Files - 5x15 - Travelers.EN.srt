I'M DEAD TOO, INSIDE,

483
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,975
BECAUSE OF THIS THING
THEY PUT IN ME.

484
00:40:46,975 --> 00:40:52,931
FOR WHAT--
TO TURN ME INTO SOME KIND
OF KILLING MACHINE,

485
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:55,634
OR JUST TO SEE
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN ?

486
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:00,355
THEY'RE NOT COMING,
YOU KNOW.

487
00:41:00,355 --> 00:41:05,010
THEY WANTED ME TO KILL YOU,
OR YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE.

488
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,229
YOU'RE PART
OF THEIR TEST NOW TOO.

489
00:41:07,562 --> 00:41:09,431
I DON'T WANT TO KILL YOU.

490
00:41:09,431 --> 00:41:11,900
I KNOW.

491
00:41:16,254 --> 00:41:19,041
MULDER.

492
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:21,360
[ Sounds Of Struggle
  Continue Over Speaker ]

493
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,313
[ Grunting ]
[ Gagging ]

494
00:41:42,764 --> 00:41:45,500
[ Dale Panting ]

495
00:41:59,781 --> 00:42:02,934
[ Struggle Continues, Ends ]

496
00:42:40,555 --> 00:42:44,459
I CAN'T BELIEVE MY FATHER
THREW IN WITH THESE MEN.

497
00:42:46,461 --> 00:42:49,748
[ Sighs ]
HE LET THEM DICTATE
HIS CONSCIENCE.

498
00:42:49,748 --> 00:42:54,052
OH, DON'T FOOL YOURSELF.
NONE OF US ARE FREE TO CHOOSE.

499
00:42:54,052 --> 00:42:56,955
I WAS RUINED
FOR MY INSUBORDINATION.

500
00:42:57,456 --> 00:43:02,461
YOU KEEP DIGGING
THROUGH THE X-FILES,

501
00:43:02,461 --> 00:43:05,030
AND THEY'LL BURY YOU TOO.

502
00:43:08,533 --> 00:43:12,754
SKUR DIED SAYING
MY FATHER'S NAME.  WHY ?

503
00:43:12,754 --> 00:43:16,091
I HAVEN'T THE FAINTEST IDEA.

504
00:43:23,732 --> 00:43:26,234
THERE WAS, UH--

505
00:43:26,234 --> 00:43:29,237
THERE'S ONE THING
YOU DIDN'T EXPLAIN.
IT WAS...

506
00:43:29,237 --> 00:43:34,025
HOW SKUR WAS ABLE TO GET AWAY;
HOW HE WAS ABLE TO LIVE IN
OBSCURITY FOR THE LAST 38 YEARS.

507
00:43:36,311 --> 00:43:39,314
THIRTY-EIGHT YEARS ?

508
00:43:39,314 --> 00:43:41,817
MY GOD.

509
00:43:41,817 --> 00:43:44,319
WELL, I KEPT HEARING THINGS
THROUGH THE YEARS, YOU KNOW.

510
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,656
PEOPLE TELL ME THINGS.
I HEARD THAT HE WAS DEAD,

511
00:43:47,656 --> 00:43:52,611
THAT HE WAS KEPT
IN SOME SECRET LAB WHILE THEY
FINISHED UP THE EXPERIMENT.

512
00:43:52,611 --> 00:43:55,514
[ Chuckling ]
I EVEN THOUGHT THAT MAYBE--

513
00:43:55,514 --> 00:43:58,517
MAYBE SOME POOR,
INNOCENT BASTARD--

514
00:43:58,517 --> 00:44:01,470
SOMEBODY WITH A CONSCIENCE--

515
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,472
MIGHT HAVE LET HIM GO.

516
00:44:22,591 --> 00:44:26,578
[ Mulder ]
WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THAT ?
WHY LET A KILLER GO FREE ?

517
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:32,484
[ Dales ]
IN THE HOPE
THAT BY LETTING HIM LIVE,

518
00:44:32,484 --> 00:44:35,487
THE TRUTH OF THE CRIMES
THAT WERE COMMITTED...

519
00:44:35,487 --> 00:44:38,490
AGAINST HIM AND THE OTHERS...

520
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:41,993
MIGHT SOMEDAY BE EXPOSED.

521
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:29,390
[ Child ]
I MADE THIS !
