1
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,879
-  Give it up, Mulder!

2
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:18,281
- You've got no chance!
- Damn it.

3
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,615
My sniper zombies
are everywhere.

4
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,398
I'll offer you a deal.

5
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:37,630
You give me the Lazarus Bowl,
and I'll give you Scully.

6
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,400
Mulder!

7
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:42,964
How 'bout this deal?

8
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,376
You give me Scully, I don't smash
the Lazarus Bowl and shove the pieces...

9
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:51,145
where the Son of God don't shine,
you cigarette-smoking mackerel snapper.

10
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,128
I break the Lazarus Bowl,
and all your sniper zombies...

11
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:07,689
go back to being good
little well-behaved corpses.

12
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:13,939
You don't fool me, Mulder.
That bowl is your Holy Grail.

13
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:17,704
Encoded in its ancient ceramic grooves
are the words Jesus spake...

14
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,371
when he raised Lazarus
from the dead.

15
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:24,747
Still capable of raising
the dead 2,000 years later.

16
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,378
Proof positive
of the paranormal.

17
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:31,356
You can no sooner destroy that
than let the redhead die.

18
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:38,355
Come on, man.
Don't break the bowl.

19
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,365
We don't wanna go back
to being dead.

20
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:45,871
There's no food, no women,
no dancing. Save the bowl,

21
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,305
and we'll dump that
ciggy-smoking stooge for you.

22
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:51,969
And you'll be the new king
of the dead.

23
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,978
I'd rather serve in heaven
than rule in hell.

24
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:30,872
Is that your flashlight, Mulder, or are
you just happy to be lying on top of me?

25
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,885
- My flashlight.

26
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,358
- Oh, that.

27
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:48,499
For seven long years I've been waiting
for just the right moment, Scully.

28
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,593
Oh, you're a sick man, Mulder.

29
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,571
Go on.

30
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,371
I love you, Scully.
No ifs, ands or...

31
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,377
"Bs."

32
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:15,710
Yesterday a small pipe bomb
ripped through the crypt of
Christ's Church here in D.C.

33
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:19,382
There were no casualties, no thefts,
no note making any demand.

34
00:04:19,457 --> 00:04:22,688
- Who's taking credit for it?
- Nobody.

35
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:26,458
She: Jodie Foster's foster child
on a Payless budget.

36
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:31,468
He's like a Jehovah's Witness
meets Harrison Ford's Witness.

37
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,837
Uh, Christ's Church.
Isn't that Cardinal O'Fallon's church?

38
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,504
Yes, O'Fallon's residence
is adjacent to the crypt.

39
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,812
- Who's Cardinal O'Fallon?
- Cardinal "O'Fallen" perhaps.

40
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:52,587
Um, he's one of the most powerful men
in the Church today.

41
00:04:52,657 --> 00:04:56,525
His name often comes up as a possibility
for the first American pope.

42
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:59,496
- Oh.

43
00:04:59,564 --> 00:05:04,934
I don't wanna be myopic,
but this looks like a straight-up
terrorist act for the A.T.F.

44
00:05:05,003 --> 00:05:07,836
- "Myopic."

45
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:09,897
Yes, it does.

46
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:13,035
- Are you gonna answer your phone?

47
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:14,669
- Me?
- Yeah.

48
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:17,510
I didn't wanna be rude.

49
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:20,244
- Sir, who the hell is this guy?
- Hello.

50
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:22,912
This is Wayne Federman. He's
an old buddy of mine from college.

51
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:25,889
He's a writer out in Hollywood now and
he's working on a F.B.I. -based movie.

52
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:29,449
- He's asked me to give him access.
- A screenwriter?

53
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:32,223
It's actually writer/producer.

54
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:34,697
That's actually just
a hindrance/pain in the neck.

55
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:37,792
Yo, yo, yo. Agent Mulder,
I don't wanna eat your lunch.

56
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:40,929
I'm just here for some
procedural flavor. Just a taste.

57
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:45,976
I have no idea
what you just said.

58
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:49,775
Well, the Skin man's filled
me in on your particular bent.

59
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:54,148
He said that you come at things maybe a
little farkatke, a little Star Trekkie,

60
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:57,552
which is the exact vibe I'm looking
for for this thing I'm doing.

61
00:05:57,622 --> 00:06:01,114
It's a Silence of the Lambs meets
Greatest Story Ever Told type thing.

62
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:05,595
It's... beautiful and
I will not be in your way.

63
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:08,462
I'll be strictly Heisenbergian.

64
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:11,229
A hologram.

65
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:14,329
Agent Mulder, Mr. Federman
will accompany you today
to Christ's Church...

66
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:16,340
where he will act
as an observer on this case.

67
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:20,674
You will extend to him
every courtesy and protection
you would a friend of the bureau's.

68
00:06:20,745 --> 00:06:24,146
Agent Scully, I require
your services here for the morning.

69
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:29,614
Sir, have I pissed you off...

70
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:32,088
in a way that's
more than normal?

71
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:34,682
- Just curious if she's more
than your partner.
- Enough, Wayne.

72
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,693
Hey, whatever.

73
00:06:54,512 --> 00:06:58,539
Cardinal O'Fallon,
can you think of anyone who might
make an attempt on your life?

74
00:06:59,851 --> 00:07:03,446
The Church always has enemies,
Agent Mulder.

75
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:07,617
The size of the bomb would
have limited its destruction
to just the crypt itself.

76
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:11,560
- Is there anything down
there worth targeting?
- Not really.

77
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:16,157
Just some old bones,
artifacts, relics,

78
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:20,728
documents that we store
down there in the cold.

79
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:23,330
I like to think of it
as God's refrigerator.

80
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:25,933
- That's a great line.
- Thank you.

81
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:28,241
- God's refrigerator.
- Wayne, shut up.

82
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:31,373
No treasures to the outside world.

83
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:35,010
Things of negligible
monetary value,

84
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:38,544
but great spiritual value
to the Church...

85
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:40,887
ancient devotional texts,

86
00:07:42,293 --> 00:07:44,227
medieval relics.

87
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:46,786
How 'bout the Shroud ofTurin?

88
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:49,527
No, I'm afraid not.

89
00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:52,399
But we do have
the bathrobe of St. Peter.

90
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,371
- You're kidding?
- Yes, I am.

91
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,374
- That's a good line.
- Thank you.

92
00:07:57,442 --> 00:07:59,376
Wayne, shut up.

93
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:02,572
Who comes down
to the crypt here?

94
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:05,138
Only myself.

95
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:08,242
A half a mile of catacombs here.

96
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:12,985
I like to walk here
during lunch.

97
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:25,764
That's where the bomb went off.

98
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:28,397
Well, my instinct, Cardinal,

99
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:32,273
is to see this desecration
of the dead less as a murder attempt...

100
00:08:32,343 --> 00:08:34,777
and more as a terrorist act.

101
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:37,440
- A message...

102
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:46,481
- Uh, this isn't me. I think it's you.

103
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:48,492
Excuse me.

104
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:52,229
That's, uh...
That's not me.

105
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:54,231
Let me check.

106
00:08:56,534 --> 00:08:58,468
Not me.

107
00:08:58,536 --> 00:09:00,936
We never get reception here.

108
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:27,392
Would that be St. Jude's
cell phone, Cardinal?

109
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:33,432
No.

110
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:35,769
That's Micah Hoffman.

111
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:51,020
Micah Hoffman, Willie Mays
and Frank Serpico.

112
00:09:51,088 --> 00:09:53,716
That's my holy trinity, Scully.

113
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,021
Of course I'm too young
to remember, but...

114
00:09:56,093 --> 00:10:00,325
wasn't he some kind of
a '60s campus radical like
a Jerry Rubin or a Mario Savio?

115
00:10:00,397 --> 00:10:04,766
Name a '60s counterculture
movement and Micah Hoffman
was at or near the center of it.

116
00:10:04,835 --> 00:10:08,066
He was one of the original Weathermen.
He was the first Yippie.

117
00:10:08,138 --> 00:10:10,072
He was a better poet
than Ginsberg.

118
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,041
And he was also the starting shortstop
for his Columbia baseball team.

119
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,773
- Then in the '70s,
didn't he go real low profile?
- Right after Altamont.

120
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:20,613
- He was never heard from again.
- The Stones get blamed for everything.

121
00:10:20,684 --> 00:10:23,915
- I don't get it.
- This should be it here.

122
00:10:27,191 --> 00:10:29,386
What did Skinner want
you for this morning?

123
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,985
Just paperwork.

124
00:10:32,062 --> 00:10:34,223
Mm-hmm.

125
00:10:42,172 --> 00:10:45,972
- Mulder, we should have a warrant.
- It's only the Constitution.

126
00:10:46,043 --> 00:10:49,012
No big deal.

127
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:52,845
- Wow.
- "Dis-Feng-Shui."

128
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,476
Mulder, sorry to denigrate
a third of your trinity,

129
00:10:55,552 --> 00:10:59,352
but it looks like Hoffman
was killed by one of his own bombs.

130
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:07,586
Well, from Dharma Bum
to Dharma Bomb.

131
00:11:13,437 --> 00:11:15,962
I knew Hoffman was a master potter.

132
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,999
Well, it appears he was
a master calligrapher as well.

133
00:11:20,077 --> 00:11:23,774
Look, Mulder, we've got gum arabic
and sodium hydroxide here.

134
00:11:23,847 --> 00:11:26,338
Whew! These would
be used to, uh...

135
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:29,011
to age the ink and the paper
prematurely.

136
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:31,316
It's a forger's trick.

137
00:11:31,388 --> 00:11:34,357
Well, from counterculture
to counterfeiter.

138
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:37,792
All right, one more pun
and I pull out my gun.

139
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:42,422
Scully, look at that.
"Cristos. "

140
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:45,559
Looks like a religious text.
Can you read Greek at all?

141
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:47,570
Well, it's pretty rusty.

142
00:11:47,638 --> 00:11:50,869
But it looks like
some kind of lost gospel.

143
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:53,466
A gospel of Mary Magdalene.

144
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:58,072
And "An Account of Christ's Life
on Earth After the Resurrection."

145
00:11:58,148 --> 00:12:00,480
- After?
- Yeah.

146
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:02,576
It's a heretical text, Mulder.

147
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:05,383
Mythical I should say,
but long rumored to be in existence.

148
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:08,892
What would Micah Hoffman be doing
with heretical religious texts?

149
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,587
I think the question is, what would
Hoffman be doing forging them?

150
00:12:11,662 --> 00:12:13,926
Ay-yi-yi. I think
the real question, Agents,

151
00:12:13,997 --> 00:12:19,367
is what might O'Fallon
be doing with Hoffman's forgeries?

152
00:12:19,436 --> 00:12:22,769
You don't need a Weatherman
to know which way the wind blows.

153
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,365
Don't shoot!

154
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:32,882
I like the way you guys work...
no warrants, no permission, no research.

155
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,010
You're like studio executives
with guns.

156
00:12:36,086 --> 00:12:39,988
Should I call you Agent Mulder
or Mr. Mulder...

157
00:12:40,057 --> 00:12:43,026
- Or do you have a nickname
or something like that?
- Shh, shh!

158
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:53,628
Like Skin man?

159
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:55,638
Just ignore me.

160
00:12:55,706 --> 00:12:57,640
What's that?

161
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:04,172
Looks like the same Gospel of Mary
Scully I.D. 'd over at Hoffman's place.

162
00:13:04,248 --> 00:13:08,514
So, is this a forgery
or is this the real thing?

163
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:11,281
Well, there is no real
Gospel of Mary, Federman.

164
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:14,347
The original would be a fake.

165
00:13:14,424 --> 00:13:18,360
All right. So is this
a real fake or a fake fake?

166
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,364
It's me.

167
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:27,334
Yes? Nothing new.
No, I can hear you.

168
00:13:27,404 --> 00:13:29,634
It's just your voice is...

169
00:13:29,706 --> 00:13:34,040
There's like a crackly sound
and then I hear the syllables.

170
00:13:34,111 --> 00:13:36,944
- Stop yelling.
Yelling isn't helping the situation.
- Hmm.

171
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:40,108
Just talk.
You're breaking up.

172
00:13:40,184 --> 00:13:42,675
No. Let me call you back.
Okay.

173
00:13:44,421 --> 00:13:47,857
Yeah, I'm telling you.
I'm going through a crypt.

174
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:17,049
Wow.

175
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,927
Oh, my God.

176
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,137
Now, Wayne,
I'm sure that it was dark in there...

177
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,805
and that your eyes
were playing tricks on you.

178
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:48,647
And you've been influenced
by ghost stories and horror movies...

179
00:14:48,718 --> 00:14:51,050
that take place in crypts
and graveyards.

180
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,921
And you hallucinated this vision
of these dancing bones...

181
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:59,393
trying to reconstruct this bowl.

182
00:14:59,462 --> 00:15:01,396
No, I didn't hallucinate.

183
00:15:01,464 --> 00:15:03,830
That was mechanical or C.G.I.

184
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,596
Federman, that wasn't a movie.
That was real life.

185
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:09,604
The difference being?

186
00:15:09,672 --> 00:15:12,038
Well, I have got
my flavor here.

187
00:15:12,108 --> 00:15:16,442
- So, I appreciate all your help.
I've got a movie to write.
- You're leaving?

188
00:15:16,512 --> 00:15:19,606
- You don't wanna get
to the bottom of this?
- Not especially.

189
00:15:19,682 --> 00:15:23,448
Well, you know, sometimes truth
can be stranger than fiction.

190
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,079
Well, fiction is quicker
than truth and cheaper.

191
00:15:26,155 --> 00:15:29,215
You want my advice?
You're both crazy.

192
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:31,226
Why do you say that?

193
00:15:31,294 --> 00:15:33,990
Well, you're crazy for believing
what you believe and...

194
00:15:34,063 --> 00:15:37,590
you're crazy for not believing
what he believes.

195
00:15:39,535 --> 00:15:42,971
I'll leave you with that.
Thank you.

196
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:48,936
I miss him already.

197
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:53,311
You know, Mulder,
I know that Federman's B.S. ing you.

198
00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:55,816
So I'm really hesitant
to mention this.

199
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:59,946
But, um, his story reminds
me of the Lazarus Bowl.

200
00:16:00,022 --> 00:16:02,456
The Lazarus Bowl?

201
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:05,221
We had this wacky nun in
Catholic school... Sister Callahan.

202
00:16:05,294 --> 00:16:08,320
We used to call her Sr. Spooky
'cause she would tell us
scary stories all the time.

203
00:16:08,397 --> 00:16:11,628
Twisted Sister.
That's my kind of nun, you know.

204
00:16:11,701 --> 00:16:14,261
Well, she would hold up an old piece
of wood with a rusty nail in it.

205
00:16:14,337 --> 00:16:18,296
And she would say,
"This is an actual piece of
the cross Christ's wrist was nailed to."

206
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:21,901
Or she'd show us a vial
of red liquid...

207
00:16:21,978 --> 00:16:24,242
and say that it was
John the Baptist's blood or something.

208
00:16:24,313 --> 00:16:27,373
She'd be in prison today.
You realize that?

209
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,284
Well, she would tell this story of when
Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead.

210
00:16:31,354 --> 00:16:35,484
And she said that there
was this old woman who was
Lazarus's aunt or something,

211
00:16:35,558 --> 00:16:38,994
- Lazarus's aunt?
- Who was spinning a clay bowl
on a wheel nearby.

212
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:43,430
And that Christ's words, the
actual incantation to raise the dead,

213
00:16:43,499 --> 00:16:46,161
were recorded in the clay grooves
of the pottery...

214
00:16:46,235 --> 00:16:48,726
just like the way music
is recorded into vinyl.

215
00:16:48,804 --> 00:16:53,969
You see? It's just not true you can't
get good science at Catholic school.
It's a lie.

216
00:16:54,043 --> 00:16:56,511
Well, Sr. Spooky...

217
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,776
says that these words
in the clay...

218
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:04,752
still have the power to raise the dead
just likeJesus raised Lazarus.

219
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,017
That is a very cool story
coming from you, Scully.

220
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:11,253
I'll have Chuck Burks
meet you over at my office.

221
00:17:11,327 --> 00:17:13,591
See if this clay has
Christ's greatest hits on it.

222
00:17:13,663 --> 00:17:18,191
And I'm gonna... I'm gonna go have
another audience with Cardinal O'Fallon.

223
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:23,170
There's music in the air,
Agent Scully.

224
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:26,675
See, everything that exists vibrates,
and therefore sings...

225
00:17:26,742 --> 00:17:29,540
the street,
your internal organs,

226
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:32,672
electricity, everything.

227
00:17:32,748 --> 00:17:35,717
Here, I'll show you.
You see?

228
00:17:35,785 --> 00:17:39,016
This is my voice bouncing around
in the red here.

229
00:17:39,088 --> 00:17:42,854
And all this yellow is ambient sound
that we habitually tune out.

230
00:17:42,925 --> 00:17:44,859
It's the hum of my hardware,

231
00:17:44,927 --> 00:17:48,021
Mulder's porn tapes on pause,
sounds from the street.

232
00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:51,089
Everything we hear
but we don't know we hear...

233
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:53,601
I can hear it
with this machine.

234
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:56,467
Oh.

235
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:59,337
What is it?

236
00:18:04,914 --> 00:18:06,882
Who made this?

237
00:18:06,949 --> 00:18:09,213
We're not sure.

238
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:11,549
Either a forger by the name
of Micah Hoffman...

239
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:16,024
or, uh, someone else in the vicinity
ofJesus Christ.

240
00:18:17,994 --> 00:18:20,827
"Buzzinga."

241
00:18:20,896 --> 00:18:23,057
Whoever did it is some kind
of a musical genius.

242
00:18:23,132 --> 00:18:26,329
This clay is vibrating in all
the keys at once. It's heavenly.

243
00:18:26,402 --> 00:18:29,997
Can you translate
what it says there for me, please?

244
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,536
Did you recover them
from the crypt?

245
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,305
Yes.

246
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:46,981
"And then Jesus took his beloved
Mary Magdalene in an embrace.

247
00:18:47,056 --> 00:18:51,755
"An embrace not of God and woman,
but of man and woman.

248
00:18:51,827 --> 00:18:55,695
"And Jesus said to Mary,
'Love the body...

249
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:58,962
"'for it is all of the soul...

250
00:18:59,035 --> 00:19:01,503
that our senses can perceive."'

251
00:19:02,672 --> 00:19:04,772
And how about these?

252
00:19:04,905 --> 00:19:07,465
These appear to be copies
of the original.

253
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:11,602
- Rough drafts.
- How?

254
00:19:11,678 --> 00:19:14,374
They're all forgeries, sir.

255
00:19:16,116 --> 00:19:19,051
Did you buy these
from Micah Hoffman?

256
00:19:22,623 --> 00:19:24,557
I thought they were real.

257
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,991
Yeah, I can understand that.
Hoffman was a master.

258
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:31,121
My partner had them analyzed,
and they're indistinguishable
from the real thing.

259
00:19:31,198 --> 00:19:34,565
The paper is authentic, the ink,
the hand, the diction, everything.

260
00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:37,570
Hoffman was also
an explosives expert.

261
00:19:37,638 --> 00:19:41,665
Do you have any idea what he might have
been doing with a bomb in the crypt?

262
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:47,808
Can you think of anybody who might have
wanted to kill Micah Hoffman?

263
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:50,975
No.

264
00:19:51,051 --> 00:19:54,077
Why were you hiding
the documents, sir?

265
00:19:55,255 --> 00:20:00,056
When Micah came to me...
with these,

266
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:03,221
as I then thought
ancient texts,

267
00:20:03,297 --> 00:20:06,198
and our experts
verified them,

268
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:09,599
it exploded a bomb
in my heart.

269
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:14,164
The Christ that I loved
was not the Christ in these texts.

270
00:20:14,241 --> 00:20:17,404
So you bought them
in order to hide them.

271
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,416
To keep others from
feeling the despair...

272
00:20:25,586 --> 00:20:29,352
and the anger that I felt.

273
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:37,259
To protect people from what I can
now see they needed no protection from.

274
00:20:37,331 --> 00:20:39,925
Why didn't you just
destroy the documents yourself?

275
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,867
I thought they were real.

276
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:46,030
I hated them.
I despised them.

277
00:20:46,106 --> 00:20:49,041
I would have liked to destroy them,
but I couldn't.

278
00:20:53,547 --> 00:20:56,107
Is being made a fool of
a crime, Agent Mulder?

279
00:20:56,183 --> 00:20:59,380
I'd be doing life
if it were, sir.

280
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,254
- Scully.

281
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:09,318
Hey, Scully, it's me. Can you horn in
on the Hoffman autopsy for me?

282
00:21:09,396 --> 00:21:12,627
- Why?
- I got a feeling Hoffman
was dead before he died.

283
00:21:12,699 --> 00:21:16,658
He was blackmailing O'Fallon with those
forgeries. Maybe O'Fallon retaliated.

284
00:21:16,737 --> 00:21:18,671
Mulder, this bowl...

285
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:22,470
Your buddy Chuck Burks says that it has
properties he's never seen before.

286
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:26,239
- Hold on a second. That's my other line.

287
00:21:26,313 --> 00:21:28,508
- Mulder.
-  Agent Mulder?

288
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:30,914
It's Wayne/Federman out in L.A.

289
00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:34,977
- I can't talk about the case.
- That's all right.
Skin man's keeping me in the loop.

290
00:21:35,055 --> 00:21:38,582
Listen. Who do you see
playing you in the movie?

291
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:43,028
- I'm in the movie?
- It's a character loosely based on you.

292
00:21:43,096 --> 00:21:48,193
- It's more of an amalgamation.
- Hold on a second, Wayne.

293
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:51,931
- Sr. Spooky, I gotta take this.
- I'll call you after the autopsy.

294
00:21:52,005 --> 00:21:54,064
Thanks.

295
00:21:54,141 --> 00:21:58,043
- How 'bout Richard Gere?

296
00:21:58,111 --> 00:22:00,306
Yeah, okay.
Seriously.

297
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,009
What if I said to you
the name Garry Shandling?

298
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:07,485
Wayne, you're breaking up. It sounded
like you said Garry Shandling.

299
00:22:07,554 --> 00:22:11,354
Garry Shandling signed on to play
the amalgamation loosely based on you.

300
00:22:11,425 --> 00:22:14,883
And Tea Leoni's playing the amalgamation
loosely based on your partner.

301
00:22:14,962 --> 00:22:17,123
You stud.
The movie's called The Lazarus Bowl.

302
00:22:17,197 --> 00:22:21,293
- How do you know about the Lazarus Bowl?
- The Skin man.

303
00:22:21,368 --> 00:22:25,099
Listen, Shandling and Leoni
wanna meet you guys.

304
00:22:25,172 --> 00:22:27,868
Get your flavor.
It's an actor type thing.

305
00:22:27,941 --> 00:22:31,468
Come on out to the studio on our dime.
We'll make it nice.

306
00:22:31,545 --> 00:22:35,003
Hey, who's... Well, then who's
gonna play Skinner in the movie?

307
00:22:35,082 --> 00:22:37,983
- Richard Gere.

308
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:41,111
Fracturing of skull
and surface abrasions...

309
00:22:41,188 --> 00:22:44,851
initially consistent
with concussive force injuries.

310
00:22:44,925 --> 00:22:49,794
I am, uh, now weighing the heart
which is... relatively normal,

311
00:22:49,863 --> 00:22:52,457
although somewhat large.

312
00:22:54,534 --> 00:22:57,002
- I'm gonna need that
when you're done with it.

313
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,004
Oh, my God!

314
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:04,174
Hoo-yeah!

315
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:13,546
- Who are you?
- I am who I am.

316
00:23:16,823 --> 00:23:20,088
Uh-uh.

317
00:23:28,402 --> 00:23:31,394
Ow! Damn it!

318
00:24:05,437 --> 00:24:07,632
What'd you find, Scully?

319
00:24:07,706 --> 00:24:12,405
In Micah Hoffman's stomach there were
traces of red wine and strychnine.

320
00:24:12,477 --> 00:24:16,277
Man, oh, Manischewitz.
Communion wine I bet.

321
00:24:16,348 --> 00:24:20,842
I bet O'Fallon poisoned Hoffman,
then placed his body near the
explosion to cover his tracks.

322
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:23,387
That's possible, Mulder.

323
00:24:23,455 --> 00:24:25,889
I could get a warrant
for O'Fallon.

324
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:29,485
You are the one God, living and true.

325
00:24:29,561 --> 00:24:32,052
Through all eternity
you live an unapproachable life.

326
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:36,362
Mulder, let's allow
the man some dignity, okay?

327
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:38,960
You fill your creatures
with every blessing...

328
00:24:39,037 --> 00:24:42,837
and lead all men
to the joyful vision of your life.

329
00:24:42,908 --> 00:24:46,503
In our joy, we sing to your glory
with all the choirs of angels.

330
00:24:46,578 --> 00:24:49,775
Holy, holy, holy Lord.

331
00:24:49,848 --> 00:24:52,578
God of power and might.

332
00:24:52,651 --> 00:24:55,779
Heaven and earth are full
of your glory.

333
00:24:55,854 --> 00:24:58,254
Hosanna in the highest.

334
00:24:58,323 --> 00:25:02,259
Blessed is he who comes
in the name of the Lord.

335
00:25:02,327 --> 00:25:05,296
Hosanna in the highest.

336
00:25:26,785 --> 00:25:29,948
LordJesus Christ,
you said to your apostles,

337
00:25:30,022 --> 00:25:34,083
"I leave you in peace.
My peace I give you. "

338
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,593
Let's get this over with.

339
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:42,259
And grant us the peace
and unity of your kingdom. Amen.

340
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:46,771
Augustine O'Fallon, you're under arrest
for the murder of Micah Hoffman.

341
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:49,204
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Oh, my God.

342
00:25:49,274 --> 00:25:52,402
- Anything you say can and will
be used against you in...
- Mulder.

343
00:25:52,477 --> 00:25:55,241
Do you see what I see?

344
00:25:57,916 --> 00:25:59,941
Yes, I do.

345
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:03,112
-  Is that Micah Hoffman?
-  Yes, it is.

346
00:26:08,727 --> 00:26:12,595
Misidentification of a corpse
and subsequent unrequested autopsy.

347
00:26:12,664 --> 00:26:16,498
Sir, the dead man looked
very much like Micah Hoffman.

348
00:26:16,568 --> 00:26:18,798
He had Hoffman's I.D. on him.

349
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:23,432
Agent Scully, if I'm carrying
Marilyn Monroe's purse,

350
00:26:23,508 --> 00:26:26,204
do you assume that
I slept with J.F.K.?

351
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:34,947
Agent Mulder, the F.B.I.
has always prided itself with
the speedy expedition of cases.

352
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,989
But this is the first time, and I hope
you're as proud of this as I am,

353
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:41,219
that we've ever attempted
to pursue a murder case where
the victim was still alive!

354
00:26:41,293 --> 00:26:43,488
A bomb went off.
A crime's been committed.

355
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:46,156
There's a dead body
nobody seems to give a damn about.

356
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,165
O'Fallon's been less
than forthcoming.

357
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,565
And Hoffman at the very least
is guilty of forgery and extortion.

358
00:26:50,635 --> 00:26:53,001
Agent Mulder, you will
leave O'Fallon alone.

359
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:57,906
You will leave Hoffman alone!
Agent Scully, you'll put your
trigger-happy scalpel away!

360
00:26:59,111 --> 00:27:02,274
Best case scenario,
you get to keep your jobs.

361
00:27:02,347 --> 00:27:06,215
Worst case, O'Fallon and
the Church bring a huge embarrassing
lawsuit against the bureau...

362
00:27:06,284 --> 00:27:10,220
which will feature you two
as the sacrificial lambs!

363
00:27:10,288 --> 00:27:12,347
As of right now,

364
00:27:14,392 --> 00:27:18,260
I'm forcing you to take
a four-week leave, effective
immediately pending review.

365
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,092
I think this whole Richard Gere thing
is going to Skinner's head.

366
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:29,038
- We're off this case, Mulder.
-  Compadres.

367
00:27:30,642 --> 00:27:33,668
I teased out something very fabulous
from your pottery there.

368
00:27:35,747 --> 00:27:37,908
- Layered in under the ambience...

369
00:27:37,983 --> 00:27:40,008
There.
Guess what language that is.

370
00:27:40,085 --> 00:27:42,952
- Chuck, I've had a bad day.
- It's a dead language.

371
00:27:43,021 --> 00:27:46,354
I had a linguist in here to listen
to the recording. It's Aramaic.

372
00:27:46,424 --> 00:27:48,358
That's the language that
Christ spoke.

373
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:52,324
Did your, uh, linguist
happen to translate it?

374
00:27:52,397 --> 00:27:54,388
Yes, he did.
It's in two parts.

375
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:58,095
The first part, here,
roughly translates as,

376
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:02,231
"I am the walrus. I am the walrus.
Paul is dead. Goo goo g'joob."

377
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:04,935
Although there is
no Aramaic word for walrus.

378
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,275
So it literally says,
"I am the bearded cow-like sea beast."

379
00:28:08,346 --> 00:28:12,749
- What's the second part?
- The second part's
a little freakier. Here.

380
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:15,945
- What is it?
- It appears to be one man...

381
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:19,081
commanding another
to rise from the dead.

382
00:28:22,694 --> 00:28:24,628
Lazarus?

383
00:28:32,904 --> 00:28:36,897
I am becomeJesus Christ.

384
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,276
I am become skeptical.

385
00:28:45,584 --> 00:28:48,451
There I was totally bumming
after Altamont.

386
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,387
And I thought, throw in the towel
and go to law school...

387
00:28:51,456 --> 00:28:56,257
or continue to fight and become a forger
of scandalous religious documents.

388
00:28:56,328 --> 00:28:59,855
I suppose that's a choice every young,
gifted, American male is faced with.

389
00:29:01,099 --> 00:29:03,090
I knew O'Fallon from college.

390
00:29:03,168 --> 00:29:06,069
- He was a divinity professor of mine.
- At Columbia?

391
00:29:06,137 --> 00:29:09,197
Yeah. And he is a decent man,
but with an overweening pride...

392
00:29:09,274 --> 00:29:12,971
and sense of responsibility
born of a fundamental...

393
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:15,569
lack of respect
for the human animal.

394
00:29:15,647 --> 00:29:18,138
He believes in God,
but not in man...

395
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:21,515
and man's ability to choose
to live in freedom.

396
00:29:21,586 --> 00:29:25,147
He has Christ in his brain,
but not in his heart.

397
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:27,623
So, uh,

398
00:29:27,692 --> 00:29:29,887
you created a Christ...

399
00:29:29,961 --> 00:29:34,398
in these forgeries that was more suited
to your particular world view?

400
00:29:34,466 --> 00:29:37,367
Yeah, but before I could write
like Christ, I had to become him,

401
00:29:37,435 --> 00:29:41,633
in much the same way I imagine an actor
who plays a part becomes that part.

402
00:29:41,706 --> 00:29:44,208
So I immersed myself
in Jesus Christ.

403
00:29:44,341 --> 00:29:46,639
Not just the Church
and teachings,

404
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:51,545
but the man,
the custom of his time,

405
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:56,245
the language, the vibe,
the feeling of Christ.

406
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,289
So why didn't O'Fallon
and the elders...

407
00:29:59,356 --> 00:30:01,517
go outside the Church
for authentification?

408
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:06,723
Because the forgeries
are too damning of the Church.
They couldn't risk the exposure.

409
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:09,732
But then...

410
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,530
something truly weird
came over me.

411
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,730
Remorse?

412
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,731
Conversion, Agent Scully.

413
00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:20,834
The lightning bolt...

414
00:30:20,911 --> 00:30:25,245
that transformed Saul to Paul
on the road to Damascus.

415
00:30:27,517 --> 00:30:30,850
One day, I was not just
impersonating Jesus Christ,

416
00:30:31,922 --> 00:30:33,856
I had become him.

417
00:30:36,526 --> 00:30:39,017
That's why I blew up the crypt.

418
00:30:39,096 --> 00:30:42,259
The forgeries were blasphemous
and needed to be destroyed.

419
00:30:46,003 --> 00:30:47,937
How did your...

420
00:30:48,005 --> 00:30:51,532
cell phone get on
the dead man in the crypt?

421
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:59,650
God works in mysterious ways.

422
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,048
God works in mysterious ways.

423
00:31:00,117 --> 00:31:04,486
Well, as long as they can think,
we'll have our problems.

424
00:31:04,554 --> 00:31:06,852
But those whom they are
using cannot think.

425
00:31:06,923 --> 00:31:10,484
They are the dead brought to assimilate
life by our electrode attempts.

426
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,494
- It's open!

427
00:31:12,562 --> 00:31:15,360
You know, it's an interesting thing
when you consider...

428
00:31:15,432 --> 00:31:17,627
you Earth people
who can think...

429
00:31:17,701 --> 00:31:20,602
are so frightened
by those who cannot... the dead.

430
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:23,333
Couldn't sleep either, huh?

431
00:31:23,407 --> 00:31:27,207
- Plan 9 from Outer Space?
- Yeah.

432
00:31:27,277 --> 00:31:29,575
It's the Ed Wood
investigative method.

433
00:31:29,646 --> 00:31:32,615
This movie is so profoundly bad
in such a childlike way...

434
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:35,208
that it hypnotizes
my conscious critical mind...

435
00:31:35,285 --> 00:31:38,277
and frees up my right brain
to make socio-poetic leaps.

436
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,448
And I started flashing
on Hoffman and O'Fallon.

437
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:43,322
How there's this
archetypal relationship.

438
00:31:43,393 --> 00:31:46,055
Like Hoffman's Jesus
to O'Fallon's Judas.

439
00:31:46,129 --> 00:31:49,257
Or Hoffman's Jesus to O'Fallon's
Dostoyevsky's grand inquisitor.

440
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:51,699
Or Hoffman's Jesus
to O'Fallon's St. Paul.

441
00:31:51,768 --> 00:31:55,761
How 'bout Hoffman's Roadrunner
to O'Fallon's Wile E. Coyote?

442
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:03,010
- Mulder?
- Yeah?

443
00:32:05,482 --> 00:32:09,441
Do you think it's at all possible
that Hoffman is reallyJesus Christ?

444
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,612
Are you making fun of me?

445
00:32:11,688 --> 00:32:13,383
No.

446
00:32:13,457 --> 00:32:15,391
Well, no, I don't.

447
00:32:15,459 --> 00:32:18,656
But crazy people
can be very persuasive.

448
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:21,197
Well, yes, I know that.

449
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,971
Maybe true faith is really
a form of insanity.

450
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,407
- Are you directing that at me?
- No!

451
00:32:33,477 --> 00:32:37,072
I'm directing it at myself
and at Ed Wood.

452
00:32:40,684 --> 00:32:44,780
Well, you know, even a broken clock
is right 730 times a year.

453
00:32:52,996 --> 00:32:54,930
- How...
- Forty-two.

454
00:32:56,433 --> 00:33:00,494
- You've seen this movie 42 times?
- Yes.

455
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,765
Doesn't that make you sad?

456
00:33:03,974 --> 00:33:05,908
It makes me sad.

457
00:33:05,976 --> 00:33:09,275
- You ever been to Hollywood?
- A couple of times a few years ago.

458
00:33:09,346 --> 00:33:11,644
You're going to be there
in the morning.

459
00:33:11,715 --> 00:33:15,651
Just a few minutes from Hollywood
in the town of San Fernando.

460
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:19,120
Reports have come in
of saucers flying so low...

461
00:33:19,189 --> 00:33:23,523
You know, Scully, we've got four-weeks
probation vacation and nothing to do.

462
00:33:23,593 --> 00:33:26,960
And Wayne Federman's invited us out
to L.A. to watch his movie being filmed.

463
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:30,591
And God knows I could use
a little sunshine.

464
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:32,532
Scully?

465
00:33:35,172 --> 00:33:37,663
California, here we come.

466
00:33:49,952 --> 00:33:52,216
-  Beep, beep.

467
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:30,657
Agents?
So glad you could hang.

468
00:34:32,561 --> 00:34:35,223
Come on. I want you to meet the people
that are gonna play you.

469
00:34:35,297 --> 00:34:40,325
- Garry Shandling, Tea Leoni,
this is Agents Mulder and Scully.
- It's a pleasure.

470
00:34:40,402 --> 00:34:43,838
- Nice to meet you. Big fan. Fox Mulder.
- No kidding?

471
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:50,210
You know, while I've got
you here, maybe, uh...

472
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:52,873
maybe you could show me
how to run in these things.

473
00:34:52,948 --> 00:34:56,076
Right over here I was thinking
'cause, I tell you...

474
00:34:56,151 --> 00:34:59,120
I mean, I'm having a hell
of a time with these heels.

475
00:34:59,188 --> 00:35:01,315
- Hey, uh...
- Hi.

476
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,052
How are you? Seriously, listen.
Can I ask you something?

477
00:35:04,126 --> 00:35:07,892
- Sure.
- Do you dress to the left
or to the right?

478
00:35:10,766 --> 00:35:12,700
What... What do you mean?

479
00:35:15,871 --> 00:35:18,840
Look, when I play a character,
I need to find his center,

480
00:35:18,907 --> 00:35:20,841
his sort of rudder, so to say.

481
00:35:20,909 --> 00:35:23,707
And then everything
comes from that.

482
00:35:26,915 --> 00:35:28,849
Uh...

483
00:35:30,452 --> 00:35:32,886
I guess mostly to the left.

484
00:35:34,356 --> 00:35:36,290
Mostly?

485
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:38,952
Most of the time.

486
00:35:39,027 --> 00:35:41,962
Most of the time...
to the left.

487
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,964
Mm-hmm.

488
00:35:44,032 --> 00:35:45,966
Wardrobe!

489
00:35:47,402 --> 00:35:49,336
-  Rolling!

490
00:35:49,404 --> 00:35:51,338
And "rollando."

491
00:35:51,406 --> 00:35:55,103
Come on, now. Kick it in the ass.
And action, zombies!

492
00:35:55,177 --> 00:35:58,943
- What is this?

493
00:35:59,014 --> 00:36:02,677
Cut. Go ahead, ruin my career.
- What seems to be the problem?

494
00:36:02,751 --> 00:36:05,618
What the hell is this?
What the hell's in my mouth?

495
00:36:05,687 --> 00:36:07,848
What is Tea Leoni's
shoulder made out of?

496
00:36:07,923 --> 00:36:10,585
Craft services, what is
Tea Leoni's shoulder made of?

497
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:14,652
- Turkey, just like you asked for.
- Turkey.

498
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,960
- Miss Leoni's shoulder's made of turkey.
- Tofu turkey!

499
00:36:17,032 --> 00:36:19,592
Tofurkey!
I asked for Tofurkey!

500
00:36:19,668 --> 00:36:24,833
I'm a vegetarian! Half the zombies
are vegetarians! Oh, my God!

501
00:36:24,907 --> 00:36:27,341
The people are made out of turkey.

502
00:36:29,311 --> 00:36:33,213
-  Hello?
- Mulder, it's me. What are you doing?

503
00:36:33,282 --> 00:36:37,013
I'm, uh, working at the computer.
What are you doing?

504
00:36:37,085 --> 00:36:42,887
I'm, uh, packing. Just getting ready
for our trip back to D.C. tomorrow.

505
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:47,793
Scully, I was just thinking
about Lazarus, Ed Wood and
those Tofurkey-eatin' zombies.

506
00:36:47,863 --> 00:36:50,058
How come when people
come back from the dead,

507
00:36:50,132 --> 00:36:52,157
they always wanna
hurt the living?

508
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:55,829
Well, that's because people can't really
come back from the dead, Mulder.

509
00:36:55,904 --> 00:36:59,135
Ghosts and zombies are just projections
of our own repressed...

510
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:03,304
cannibalistic and sexual fears
and desires.

511
00:37:03,378 --> 00:37:05,812
They are who we fear
that we are at heart.

512
00:37:05,881 --> 00:37:09,339
Just mindless automatons
who can only kill and eat.

513
00:37:09,418 --> 00:37:11,943
Party pooper.
Well, I got a new theory.

514
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,547
I say that when zombies try to eat
people, that's just the first stage.

515
00:37:15,624 --> 00:37:19,685
They've just come back from being dead,
so they're gonna do
all the things they missed.

516
00:37:19,761 --> 00:37:22,696
So first they're gonna eat,
then they're gonna drink.

517
00:37:22,764 --> 00:37:25,062
Then they're gonna dance
and make love.

518
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:28,591
Oh, I see. So it's just that we never
get to stay with them long enough...

519
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,639
to see the gentler side
of the undead.

520
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,641
- Exactly.

521
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:37,076
Hold on a second.
That's my other line. Hello?

522
00:37:37,145 --> 00:37:40,740
Agent Mulder, it's Assistant
Director Skinner. I hope
I didn't catch you at a bad time.

523
00:37:40,816 --> 00:37:42,943
No, sir.
I'm just at the computer.

524
00:37:43,018 --> 00:37:47,614
I wanted to apologize for coming
down so hard on you during
the Hoffman/O'Fallon case.

525
00:37:47,689 --> 00:37:50,556
Oh. I appreciate that, Skin man.

526
00:37:50,626 --> 00:37:52,560
- Don't call me that.
- Yes, sir.

527
00:37:52,628 --> 00:37:56,928
- Um, where are you now?
- I'm right underneath you.

528
00:37:56,999 --> 00:38:00,765
I'm in L.A. at the same hotel as you,
right below you and Agent Scully.

529
00:38:00,836 --> 00:38:04,169
Federman got me an associate producer
credit on the movie.

530
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:06,537
A.P. Skinner, huh?

531
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:11,804
Uh, so what are you
up to right now, sir?

532
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,974
I'm taking a bubble bath.

533
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,984
Uh, hold on just one second, sir.

534
00:38:19,288 --> 00:38:22,485
Hey, Scully, Skin man is calling me
from a bubble bath.

535
00:38:22,557 --> 00:38:24,548
It's still me, Mulder.

536
00:38:24,626 --> 00:38:29,859
Uh, sorry. Just-Just hold on
one second, sir.

537
00:38:29,931 --> 00:38:31,865
- Scully?
- Yeah.

538
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:34,128
Skinner is calling me
from a bubble bath.

539
00:38:34,202 --> 00:38:37,330
Wow. He's really gone Hollywood.

540
00:38:37,406 --> 00:38:39,931
- Totally.
- You know, Mulder,

541
00:38:40,008 --> 00:38:43,944
speaking of Hollywood, I think that
Tea Leoni has a little crush on you.

542
00:38:44,012 --> 00:38:48,312
Oh, yeah, right. Like Tea Leoni's
ever gonna have a crush on me.

543
00:38:48,383 --> 00:38:50,943
I think that Shandling
likes you a bit too.

544
00:38:51,019 --> 00:38:53,022
Really?

545
00:38:55,324 --> 00:38:57,656
I love you, Scully.

546
00:38:57,726 --> 00:39:00,251
- No, ifs, ands or...
- "Bs."

547
00:39:03,565 --> 00:39:07,126
Wait. Wait, Mulder. I can't.

548
00:39:07,202 --> 00:39:09,534
I know this feels
wrong because we're friends...

549
00:39:09,605 --> 00:39:12,233
and we treat each other
as equals, but...

550
00:39:12,307 --> 00:39:14,935
No. No, it's not that.
It's not that.

551
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,944
Well, what then?

552
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:24,316
I'm in love with Assistant
Director Walter Skinner.

553
00:39:24,386 --> 00:39:29,517
- That's it, Scully.
I just can't take it anymore.
- Shh, Mulder. Sit down.

554
00:39:29,591 --> 00:39:33,652
- What does he have that I don't have?
- A bigger flashlight.

555
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,755
I've been looking
all over for you.

556
00:40:12,067 --> 00:40:14,331
They got it so wrong, Scully.

557
00:40:19,007 --> 00:40:22,101
I got a page from
the Washington bureau.

558
00:40:24,246 --> 00:40:27,079
Micah Hoffman
was murdered tonight.

559
00:40:27,149 --> 00:40:30,448
Murdered in his own home
by Cardinal O'Fallon,

560
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:32,453
who then hanged himself.

561
00:40:33,789 --> 00:40:35,723
A murder/suicide.

562
00:40:35,791 --> 00:40:37,554
It's Jesus and Judas, Scully.

563
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:41,221
Well, it's all over now.

564
00:40:41,296 --> 00:40:43,287
No, no.

565
00:40:43,365 --> 00:40:46,198
It's just beginning.

566
00:40:46,268 --> 00:40:48,964
Hoffman and O'Fallon
were these complicated,

567
00:40:49,037 --> 00:40:51,597
flawed, beautiful people.

568
00:40:51,673 --> 00:40:54,767
And now they'll just be remembered
as jokes because of this movie.

569
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:58,802
The character based on O'Fallon
is listed in the credits
as "Cigarette-Smoking Pontiff."

570
00:40:58,881 --> 00:41:01,145
How silly is that?

571
00:41:02,284 --> 00:41:04,218
- Pretty silly.
- And what about us?

572
00:41:04,286 --> 00:41:07,255
How are we gonna be remembered
now because of this movie?

573
00:41:07,322 --> 00:41:09,256
Well, hopefully
the movie will tank.

574
00:41:09,324 --> 00:41:13,658
What about all the dead people
who are forever silent and
can't tell their stories anymore?

575
00:41:13,729 --> 00:41:16,926
They're all gonna have to
rely on Hollywood to show
the future how we lived.

576
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:19,832
And it'll all become
oversimplified...

577
00:41:19,902 --> 00:41:23,770
and trivialized and
Cigarette-Smoking "Pontificized"...

578
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,535
and become as plastic
and meaningless...

579
00:41:26,608 --> 00:41:30,135
as this stupid plastic
Lazarus Bowl.

580
00:41:30,212 --> 00:41:33,443
I think the dead are beyond caring
what people think about them.

581
00:41:33,515 --> 00:41:36,484
Hopefully we can adopt
the same attitude.

582
00:41:36,552 --> 00:41:40,181
You do know that there aren't
real dead people out there, right?

583
00:41:40,255 --> 00:41:42,849
That this is a movie set?

584
00:41:42,925 --> 00:41:46,952
- The dead are everywhere, Scully.

585
00:41:47,029 --> 00:41:50,055
Well, we're alive.

586
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:53,367
And we're relatively young.

587
00:41:53,435 --> 00:41:59,169
- And Skinner was so
tickled by the movie...
- I bet he was.

588
00:41:59,241 --> 00:42:01,801
that he has given us
a bureau credit card...

589
00:42:01,877 --> 00:42:04,107
to use for the evening.

590
00:42:06,582 --> 00:42:08,516
Come on.

591
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:18,516
Mulder, I have something
to confess.

592
00:42:18,594 --> 00:42:22,997
- What's that?
- I'm in love with Associate
Producer Walter Skinner.

593
00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:29,333
Ah, me too.
