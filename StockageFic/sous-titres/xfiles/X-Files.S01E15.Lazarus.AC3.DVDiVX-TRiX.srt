1
00:00:06,086 --> 00:00:09,112
Relax. They'll be here.

2
00:00:09,189 --> 00:00:11,623
Banks going to close
in five minutes.

3
00:00:11,692 --> 00:00:13,057
Sure it wasn't a bogus tip?

4
00:00:13,126 --> 00:00:13,990
It's real.

5
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:15,961
I've been on this long enough.

6
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:17,394
I know the difference.

7
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:19,295
Besides, I can feel it.

8
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:20,799
I'm inside their heads.

9
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:23,802
just as long as you keepyours.

10
00:00:25,272 --> 00:00:28,935
Message received,
Agent Scully, loud and clear.

11
00:00:31,178 --> 00:00:33,305
Position five.

12
00:00:33,413 --> 00:00:35,313
It's Agent Willis.

13
00:00:35,382 --> 00:00:37,373
Doyou copy?

14
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:52,688
What, areyou nervous?

15
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:54,529
Nope.

16
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:58,537
I just don't want
our luck to run out.

17
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:00,800
Baby, you are my luck.

18
00:01:00,874 --> 00:01:04,002
No matterwhat happens

19
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:07,274
whenever I look up
at the stars

20
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:11,647
I knowyou're going to be
looking up at the same ones.

21
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:15,414
The same ones, baby.

22
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:26,365
You make every day
like New Year's Eve.

23
00:01:31,972 --> 00:01:34,406
Get down!

24
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:35,907
Get down on the ground!

25
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:38,637
I want everyone
on the ground now! now!

26
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:39,973
Get down!

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,105
You too-- on the foor!

28
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:43,113
On the foor!

29
00:01:43,183 --> 00:01:44,741
I'll execute all ofyou!

30
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:45,750
(woman screaming)

31
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,753
Put the money
in the bag now!

32
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:51,086
Move!

33
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:53,854
Freeze!
Drop the gun! FBl!

34
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:55,554
Drop the gun--

35
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:56,561
Now!

36
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:20,286
I need more saline
in here, stat.

37
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:22,651
Up to 360, now.

38
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:24,690
1 1 minutes, 55 seconds.

39
00:02:24,758 --> 00:02:26,089
Clear.

40
00:02:27,327 --> 00:02:29,488
Come on,Jack.

41
00:02:29,563 --> 00:02:31,963
He's been fatlined
for over 1 2 minutes.

42
00:02:32,032 --> 00:02:35,365
Another amp of EPI
and we'll go again at 360.

43
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:36,129
Clear.

44
00:02:39,873 --> 00:02:41,568
(sighs)

45
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:44,668
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:47,808
You want me to pronounce?

47
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:48,779
No.

48
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:50,942
You can't give up on him.

49
00:02:51,017 --> 00:02:52,848
It's been 1 3 minutes. He's dead.

50
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,250
Go up to 400.

51
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:56,186
We lost him. Let him go.

52
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:57,518
I'm a doctor.

53
00:02:57,591 --> 00:02:58,853
Go up to 400

54
00:02:58,925 --> 00:03:01,086
or I'll do it myself.

55
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:03,253
Clear.

56
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:08,000
Give him another amp
of EPI intracardial

57
00:03:08,068 --> 00:03:10,229
and go up to 400 again.

58
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:11,833
Do it.

59
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:17,810
Clear.

60
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,573
Again.

61
00:03:21,414 --> 00:03:22,779
Come on,Jack.

62
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:23,873
Clear.

63
00:03:30,056 --> 00:03:31,045
We got a rhythm.

64
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:33,285
Don't ask me how,
but he's back.

65
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,487
B.P.'s 80 over 50
and climbing.

66
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:37,154
90 over 50...

67
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:34,844
Hello, Mr. Goldbaum.

68
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:37,007
How are we doing tonight?

69
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:54,192
(gunshot)

70
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:20,351
Anyword from Willis?

71
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,648
Still missing.

72
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:25,122
He hasn't been home or
checked in with the office.

73
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:27,386
I heard something
about a mutilation?

74
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,690
Yeah. Three fingers
on Dupre's left hand

75
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:31,492
were severed
by surgical shears.

76
00:07:31,564 --> 00:07:32,656
We lifted prints.

77
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:33,790
They're Willis's.

78
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:36,165
He was chasing this guy
almost a year?

79
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:37,863
Yeah, he lived the case.

80
00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:40,565
It was all he thought about,
talked about.

81
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,868
What areyou thinking?

82
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:46,901
That maybe this is some kind
ofpost-trauma psychosis.

83
00:07:47,013 --> 00:07:49,379
Like the way soldiers
sometimes mutilate a dead enemy.

84
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:51,041
That still doesn't explain

85
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:52,675
why he would
just vanish.

86
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:53,912
Dupre's partner--

87
00:07:53,987 --> 00:07:55,249
who was she?

88
00:07:56,489 --> 00:07:58,013
Lula Phillips.

89
00:07:58,091 --> 00:08:00,992
They met while
she was serving

90
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,425
a ten-year sentence
for manslaughter

91
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:04,929
at the Women's Correctional
Facility of Maryland.

92
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:06,226
He was a prison guard.

93
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:08,665
Until the warden found out
their secret.

94
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:10,259
According to Lula's cell mate

95
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:12,133
they carried on
quite a torrid romance.

96
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:14,833
It says she was released
on May 2, 1 993.

97
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:16,899
One week
before the first robbery

98
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:18,375
at Annapolis Savings and Loan.

99
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:23,609
The 65-year-old female teller
was pistol-whipped.

100
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:25,479
Died from
a subdural hemorrhage

101
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:28,316
because she didn't get
the money fast enough.

102
00:08:28,388 --> 00:08:29,355
Lovely couple.

103
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:31,514
They took turns--
one pulling ajob

104
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:33,616
while the other one
drove getaway.

105
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,254
The two ofthem
have killed seven people

106
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:38,593
and gotten away
with close to $1 00,000.

107
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:40,257
That's a lot ofmoney.

108
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,324
Now she doesn't
have to split it.

109
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:44,393
We're putting
her face out there--

110
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:49,237
Iocal newspapers,
America's Most Wanted.

111
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,140
Am I boring you?

112
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:54,804
Theywere married.

113
00:08:54,914 --> 00:08:57,109
Yeah, last May in Atlantic City.
So what?

114
00:08:57,217 --> 00:09:00,050
I don't think this was a simple
necrophiliac mutilation.

115
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:02,849
Willis sliced and diced
those fingers to get

116
00:09:02,922 --> 00:09:04,116
at the wedding ring.

117
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:28,677
Anybody here?

118
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,117
Lula?

119
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,964
Baby, baby, baby.

120
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:05,184
Damn.

121
00:10:27,307 --> 00:10:28,706
Scully:
It's a left thumbprint.

122
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:31,505
You can see that whoever
held that cleaver

123
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:33,169
was using his left hand.

124
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,940
"Whoever"? It was Willis.

125
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:36,174
Willis is right-handed.

126
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:38,546
I checked his pistol grip
at the armory.

127
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:41,587
Bank surveillance tapes
show Dupre is left-handed.

128
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:43,451
I'm not sure
whereyou're going.

129
00:10:43,523 --> 00:10:45,150
How long
did Willis fatline?

130
00:10:45,224 --> 00:10:46,521
just over 1 3 minutes.

131
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:48,753
This is the E.K.G. strip
that recorded

132
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:53,288
his cardiac activity
at the time.

133
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:56,569
In your medical opinion,
what does that look like?

134
00:10:56,703 --> 00:10:58,364
It could be anything--

135
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:01,896
an instrument malfunction,
electrical overload.

136
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:04,000
But what does it look like?

137
00:11:04,077 --> 00:11:08,013
Two heartbeats.

138
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:09,605
Dupre and Willis

139
00:11:09,682 --> 00:11:12,150
went into cardiac arrest
at the exact same time, right?

140
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:13,207
Right.

141
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:14,981
Which means for minutes,
both men

142
00:11:15,088 --> 00:11:16,316
were technically dead.

143
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:18,583
Technically,
but we resuscitated Willis.

144
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:20,022
You resuscitated his body.

145
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:21,390
Mulder...

146
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:23,588
Two men died in that crash room.

147
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:25,995
One man came back.

148
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:27,396
The question is...

149
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:30,664
which one?

150
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:40,545
What can you tell me

151
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:42,843
about near-death experiences,
Agent Scully?

152
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:44,940
The usual stuff--
the tunnel, the light

153
00:11:45,018 --> 00:11:47,714
people rising up and viewing
their own bodies.

154
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,015
How doyou account
for the phenomenon?

155
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:52,557
Some sort ofdissociative,
hallucinatory activity.

156
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,889
Did you know that
halfofall adults

157
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:56,929
who have had
a near-death experience

158
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,327
can't wear a watch?

159
00:11:58,398 --> 00:12:00,832
The increased electrical
activity in their bodies

160
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,094
renders the watches

161
00:12:02,168 --> 00:12:05,763
inoperable.

162
00:12:05,838 --> 00:12:06,770
Now, I know

163
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:07,828
this sounds kooky

164
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:10,137
but as any biologist
will tell you

165
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:12,575
when cells die
and genetic material unfolds

166
00:12:12,645 --> 00:12:13,873
tremendous energy is released.

167
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:16,380
Mulder:
Dr. Varnes believes
this burst ofenergy

168
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:19,350
is responsible for the
transformational nature

169
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:20,511
ofthe experience.

170
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,057
People do return
profoundly changed.

171
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:26,785
Changed how?

172
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:28,986
Personality shifts,
perceived psychic abilities

173
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:30,426
increased zest for life.

174
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:32,430
What about
the negative consequences?

175
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:35,092
They're rare, but apparently,
in the process ofdying

176
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:38,604
there is a window oftime during
which the body is vulnerable.

177
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:39,865
I don't understand.

178
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:42,430
There was a pilot
in my support group

179
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:44,499
who died
in a commuter plane crash

180
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:46,374
along with
his three passengers.

181
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:48,209
This was a fewyears ago.

182
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:51,079
He recalls foating up

183
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,414
and then feeling
an overwhelming need

184
00:12:53,486 --> 00:12:54,817
to return to his body.

185
00:12:54,921 --> 00:13:00,450
He was revived
in the ambulance--

186
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,323
the only survivor.

187
00:13:02,395 --> 00:13:05,228
It was soon after that
that the visions started.

188
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:08,529
Visions ofmaking love
to his wife in ways and places

189
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:10,626
that weren't in his memory.

190
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:13,297
A dead passenger on the plane
was having an affair

191
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:15,499
with his wife.

192
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:17,133
The dead passenger's
consciousness

193
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,541
survived through the pilot.

194
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:19,737
What happened?

195
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:21,677
The pilot became
increasingly disoriented--

196
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:25,342
a schizophrenic,
his doctor claims--

197
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:29,218
until one day he strangled
his wife with an extension cord.

198
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,124
That's a nice story.

199
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:39,321
I don't discount
the near-death experience

200
00:13:39,398 --> 00:13:40,695
because it can be explained

201
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:42,666
by stimulation
ofthe temporal lobe.

202
00:13:42,735 --> 00:13:44,100
I sense a big "but" coming.

203
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,330
It's my best guess

204
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:46,928
jack's disappearance
can be explained

205
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:49,133
in psychological,
not supernatural, terms.

206
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,470
For instance?

207
00:13:50,543 --> 00:13:53,137
The stress ofthe case,
the trauma ofbeing shot

208
00:13:53,212 --> 00:13:54,179
jack's personality.

209
00:13:54,247 --> 00:13:55,976
How well doyou know him?

210
00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:57,777
We dated for almost a year.

211
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,412
He was my instructor
at the academy.

212
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:05,556
The plot thickens.

213
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,155
We even had the same birthday.

214
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:12,663
We used to celebrate
in some dive in Stafford

215
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:14,996
that had
a slanting pool table.

216
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:17,262
But it was always
so hard

217
00:14:17,336 --> 00:14:18,496
forJack to relax.

218
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:20,471
It was impossible for him
really.

219
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,031
He was always so intense,
so relentlessly determined.

220
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:24,576
Doyou believe he's predisposed

221
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:28,512
to this type
ofpsychotic episode?

222
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:32,017
It's a long way from saying
jack had a near-death experience

223
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:34,848
to saying his body's
been inhabited byWarren Dupre.

224
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:39,388
A long way.

225
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:45,429
What the hell?

226
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:50,128
You're such a creature
ofhabit, Tommy.

227
00:14:50,203 --> 00:14:51,534
Who the hell areyou?

228
00:14:51,604 --> 00:14:53,196
Get out ofbed.

229
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:54,432
I ain't got no clothes on.

230
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:55,565
Get out ofbed.

231
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:57,632
I don't want to shootyou
lying down.

232
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,302
Areyou the rent man?

233
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:01,676
'Cause I'm all paid up.

234
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:03,214
Come on,
you can go ask Cosmo.

235
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:09,517
Shut up.

236
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:10,247
Where is she?

237
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:11,983
Where's who?

238
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:13,149
Your sister.

239
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:15,454
Lula?

240
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:16,426
I don't know.

241
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:18,258
I was waiting to see her

242
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:19,423
on the news.

243
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:21,125
What I tell you?

244
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,827
Check it out.

245
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:36,112
The sound's busted.

246
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:37,911
Looks like
they'll find her

247
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:39,679
beforeyou do, pal.

248
00:15:39,752 --> 00:15:41,219
Is that whatyou think?

249
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,754
That's not what I think.

250
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:50,891
I miss her, Tommy.

251
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:54,228
I miss her so bad.

252
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,361
That's why I came back.

253
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:01,966
Do I knowyou from somewhere?

254
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:05,704
Everything I see, I see her.

255
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:08,008
jesus, man, you're bleeding.

256
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:16,546
Even ugliness is beautiful
because ofher.

257
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:22,889
Okay, what areyou doing?

258
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:24,657
You set us up, Tommy.

259
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:28,256
You sold us out to the FBl.

260
00:16:29,402 --> 00:16:31,233
Dupre?

261
00:16:34,173 --> 00:16:36,141
(gunshot)

262
00:16:42,114 --> 00:16:43,911
Neighbors heard a gunshot

263
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:45,917
but nobody bothered
to check it out.

264
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:47,714
The patrol guys
responded this morning

265
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:50,381
to an anonymous 91 1
and found him here

266
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:52,151
except the rats
found him first.

267
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:53,953
The victim's name
was Thomas Phillips.

268
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:55,288
That's Lula's brother.

269
00:16:55,361 --> 00:16:57,625
There's not a lot
offamily resemblance left

270
00:16:57,697 --> 00:16:59,961
between the rats
and the .45 he took

271
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:01,260
in the face.

272
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:03,325
Oh, I hate
this nicotine stuff.

273
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:04,699
What's his story?

274
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,828
He's single.

275
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:07,805
He's lived here alone
for seven months.

276
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:09,602
A few priors,
small stuffmostly--

277
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:11,472
B and E,
narcotics possession.

278
00:17:11,577 --> 00:17:13,010
Nothing like
his big sister.

279
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:18,016
Was the television turned on
when they found him?

280
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:20,343
No. Why?

281
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:22,410
I don't thinkTommy
was a reader

282
00:17:22,488 --> 00:17:24,012
since he doesn't own any books.

283
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,148
From the position

284
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:26,555
ofthe body,
maybe he

285
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,853
was watching the tube

286
00:17:27,927 --> 00:17:30,418
when he was shot.

287
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:32,794
Print kit's over there.
Knockyourselfout.

288
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:34,298
Out ofmyway, ace.

289
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:36,494
Regulations state
to gain access to a crime scene

290
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:38,298
you got to show me l.D.

291
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:40,032
Looks like
you were right.

292
00:17:40,106 --> 00:17:41,767
Excuse me.

293
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:43,364
jack...

294
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,402
(gunshots)

295
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:51,012
Is there a problem here?

296
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,075
No, I just don't have
any l.D.

297
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:57,020
and would you tell
this gentleman who I am?

298
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:59,114
This is agentJackWillis.

299
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:01,887
He's with the Violent
Crime Section

300
00:18:01,961 --> 00:18:03,553
ofthe Washington Bureau.

301
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:05,927
Let's talk out here.

302
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:07,556
I wasjust doing myjob.

303
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:09,624
For God's sake, Willis,
what happened?

304
00:18:09,702 --> 00:18:11,602
Halfthe Bureau's
been looking foryou.

305
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,830
Where haveyou been?

306
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:13,769
I don't know.

307
00:18:13,873 --> 00:18:15,101
I just... wasn't myself.

308
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:16,834
I woke up in the street.

309
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:19,240
I'm taking you back
to the hospital.

310
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:20,608
I'm staying right here.

311
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:21,805
You're not ready to be here.

312
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:22,905
Who says?

313
00:18:23,015 --> 00:18:24,482
You're recovering
from a major trauma.

314
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:28,576
It's a miracle
you can even walk around.

315
00:18:28,654 --> 00:18:30,246
This is Tommy Phillips'
place, right?

316
00:18:30,322 --> 00:18:31,414
jack...

317
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,253
Was he killed with a .45?

318
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:36,317
As a matter offact, he was.

319
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:38,022
That's Lula's weapon ofchoice.

320
00:18:38,097 --> 00:18:39,325
I know these people.

321
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:42,299
I've been after them
for a long time.

322
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:43,926
We're halfway there.

323
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:48,496
You did open the book
on this one.

324
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:50,575
I'll be there when it's closed.

325
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:52,110
All right.

326
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:54,805
But as a colleague
and as a friend

327
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:57,280
I'm recommending you undergo
a medical evaluation--

328
00:18:57,349 --> 00:18:59,874
physical and psychological.

329
00:18:59,952 --> 00:19:01,510
All right, fair enough.

330
00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:11,490
jack, good to seeyou

331
00:19:11,564 --> 00:19:13,259
back among the living.

332
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:14,594
It's good to be back.

333
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:15,463
jack.

334
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:17,229
So what do we got here?

335
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:19,567
Mulder here found
a print on the TV--

336
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:20,935
a partial oblique--

337
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,371
and it's not
the victim's.

338
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:25,069
Good work, Agent Mulder.

339
00:19:25,177 --> 00:19:27,407
I'm impressed.

340
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:43,857
That's fancy shooting.

341
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:46,090
Yeah, well, I got
to get recertified

342
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:48,429
before they give me
myweapon back.

343
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:51,702
I wouldn't worry

344
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,534
about recertification.

345
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,574
Is there anything else
you wanted?

346
00:19:56,642 --> 00:19:59,202
Yeah. It's, uh,
Scully's birthday

347
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:02,109
and I was wondering
ifyou'd sign that for her.

348
00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:03,307
Sure.

349
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:04,747
Be glad to.

350
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:08,014
I'm always glad to celebrate
the good times.

351
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:16,157
Hereyou go.

352
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:18,628
Happy birthday, Scully.

353
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:20,659
You're two months early.

354
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:21,995
It's from Willis.

355
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:26,367
I thoughtyou two
had the same birthday.

356
00:20:26,438 --> 00:20:27,234
We do.

357
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:29,102
Well, that's
news to him.

358
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,541
I asked him to sign it.

359
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:34,078
You mean you tested him.

360
00:20:34,146 --> 00:20:37,115
After I found out evidence from
the Phillips murder is missing.

361
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:38,410
What evidence?

362
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:39,610
The print we lifted.

363
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:41,084
Our best lead is gone.

364
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:44,020
Someone stole it before
the lab had a chance

365
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:46,216
to take a look at it.

366
00:20:47,793 --> 00:20:50,819
And you thinkWillis
is responsible?

367
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:53,330
I'm not sure
Willis is Willis.

368
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:56,664
Can you
at least accept

369
00:20:56,735 --> 00:20:58,259
the possibility that during
his near-death experience

370
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:00,464
some kind ofpsychic
transference occurred?

371
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:03,440
Can'tyou accept the possibility
that this isn't an X-File?

372
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:06,342
Aside from the expected level
ofpost-trauma stress

373
00:21:06,412 --> 00:21:08,573
jack passed
both ofhis evaluations--

374
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:10,410
physical and psychological.

375
00:21:10,482 --> 00:21:11,881
Anyway,
just because someone

376
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:14,681
forgets a birthday doesn't mean
that he's been possessed.

377
00:21:14,753 --> 00:21:17,085
When I was studying
for my medical boards

378
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:18,418
I forgot my birthday too.

379
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,390
Did you forget
how to sign your name?

380
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:23,223
This is a copy ofthe automobile
requisition form

381
00:21:23,295 --> 00:21:27,629
Willis filed the day
before he was shot.

382
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,294
Compare the signatures.

383
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,802
Like I said, Mulder, stress.

384
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:37,933
We both know it can
significantly affect

385
00:21:38,043 --> 00:21:39,408
someone's cursive standard.

386
00:21:39,478 --> 00:21:43,039
I'm afraid
this doesn't prove a thing.

387
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:17,438
(phone ringing)

388
00:22:17,516 --> 00:22:19,746
Agent Willis here.

389
00:22:22,955 --> 00:22:25,355
jack, where areyou going?

390
00:22:25,424 --> 00:22:26,982
We got a break.

391
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,357
A landlord in Boyle Heights
thinks he's got our girl.

392
00:22:29,428 --> 00:22:30,588
Hot line?

393
00:22:30,663 --> 00:22:32,654
Yeah. Saw her picture
in the post office.

394
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:34,028
Can I askyou something?

395
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:35,259
Yeah, sure.

396
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:38,428
The print Mulder
lifted offthe television--

397
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:40,027
it's missing.

398
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:42,605
And?

399
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:45,644
And you were carrying
the evidence back.

400
00:22:45,744 --> 00:22:48,212
Areyou implying
something, Agent Scully?

401
00:22:52,785 --> 00:22:54,844
I don't know anything
about any missing print.

402
00:22:56,422 --> 00:22:57,912
Now I'm ten minutes
away from closing

403
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,220
the biggest case in my career.

404
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:01,657
Areyou coming?

405
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:06,520
What's that
apartment number again?

406
00:23:06,598 --> 00:23:07,895
Number 202.

407
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:09,627
Oh, yeah.

408
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:21,373
What's this guy's name?

409
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:22,846
Multrevich.

410
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:24,109
Multrevich?

411
00:23:24,183 --> 00:23:25,810
(knocking)

412
00:23:25,884 --> 00:23:27,112
Mr. Multrevich?

413
00:23:27,186 --> 00:23:28,653
I'm from the FBl,
jackWillis.

414
00:23:28,721 --> 00:23:29,483
We spoke

415
00:23:29,555 --> 00:23:31,352
on the phone.

416
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:32,583
Oh, yeah.

417
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:34,717
Haveyou ever seen this lady?

418
00:23:37,262 --> 00:23:38,422
Yeah. 207.

419
00:23:38,497 --> 00:23:40,021
Two days ago.

420
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:42,397
First and last
month, cash.

421
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:43,400
Where's 207?

422
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:44,868
Down the hallway,
round the corner.

423
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,700
Mr. Multrevich, go back
insideyour apartment

424
00:23:47,806 --> 00:23:49,774
and stay away
from the windows.

425
00:23:52,411 --> 00:23:53,844
Where's our backup?

426
00:23:53,912 --> 00:23:55,709
You called them, right?

427
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:58,750
Yeah, they should have been
here ten minutes ago.

428
00:23:58,817 --> 00:24:01,342
She may be running
down a fire escape.

429
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,717
I'll call it in again.

430
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:03,720
Look.

431
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:05,279
That's her.

432
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:23,307
Where is she?

433
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:24,808
Where did she go?

434
00:24:24,877 --> 00:24:26,606
I'll check back here.

435
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:28,964
Aah!

436
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:34,603
Face down.

437
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,011
Face down!

438
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:38,379
Hands behind your back.

439
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,610
Now!

440
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:49,359
She's all yours,Jack.

441
00:25:49,428 --> 00:25:52,397
Yeah.

442
00:25:52,464 --> 00:25:53,556
Like a dog

443
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:55,691
on a leash.

444
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:09,873
I already cuffed her.

445
00:26:09,948 --> 00:26:11,643
They're foryou, Scully.
Put them on.

446
00:26:11,717 --> 00:26:14,208
What's going on,Jack?

447
00:26:14,286 --> 00:26:16,686
Put them on,
or I'll blowyou in half.

448
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:18,017
jack...

449
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,022
Shut up!

450
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:20,752
Put them on.

451
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:45,616
Come on, baby.

452
00:26:47,486 --> 00:26:49,386
Come on, get up, baby.

453
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:52,548
I want to look atyou.

454
00:26:52,624 --> 00:26:53,955
Your face

455
00:26:54,026 --> 00:26:55,459
is all dirty.

456
00:26:55,527 --> 00:26:57,825
Keepyour stinking hands
offme.

457
00:26:57,896 --> 00:27:01,730
Baby, you ain't going
to believe where I've been.

458
00:27:12,411 --> 00:27:13,969
Sure it's crazy.

459
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:16,411
You don't think
I know it's crazy?

460
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:19,416
This isn't my face,
these aren't my hands

461
00:27:19,484 --> 00:27:21,475
but it's me in here.

462
00:27:21,586 --> 00:27:24,282
And I knowyou.
I know everything aboutyou, baby.

463
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:26,483
Come on, ask me something.

464
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:28,025
Your birthday's April 7.

465
00:27:28,093 --> 00:27:29,890
Your favorite color is red.

466
00:27:29,962 --> 00:27:31,156
Come on.

467
00:27:31,229 --> 00:27:33,288
Come on, ask me
something else.

468
00:27:33,365 --> 00:27:34,798
Come on, ask me.

469
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:37,300
Okay.

470
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:39,269
Okay. What did we do
afterwe got married?

471
00:27:40,906 --> 00:27:42,430
Right after?

472
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:46,042
After that.

473
00:27:46,144 --> 00:27:50,171
Well, we went down
to the beach.

474
00:27:50,282 --> 00:27:52,648
I took out my buck knife

475
00:27:52,718 --> 00:27:54,982
and I sliced open my palm

476
00:27:55,053 --> 00:27:58,716
and then I slit open
your palm...

477
00:28:02,494 --> 00:28:05,861
and we let the blood
drip down in the water.

478
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:14,261
Then what did you say to me?

479
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:17,137
I said,
"This is so we can be married

480
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:19,837
in all the oceans ofthe world."

481
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:30,479
And then I madeyou
a solemn oath...

482
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:37,956
to never take this ring off
my finger.

483
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,089
Ever.

484
00:28:41,733 --> 00:28:44,497
I mean to keep
that promise.

485
00:28:48,306 --> 00:28:51,571
This is...
this isjust too weird.

486
00:28:51,676 --> 00:28:54,338
I can't believe it's reallyyou.

487
00:28:58,917 --> 00:29:00,942
Don't worry, baby.

488
00:29:04,423 --> 00:29:07,415
It won't make any
difference in the dark.

489
00:29:11,396 --> 00:29:12,727
We'll be in touch.

490
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:14,993
When do I get my reward?

491
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:16,364
We'll call you.

492
00:29:16,435 --> 00:29:17,629
Now I'm worried.

493
00:29:17,702 --> 00:29:19,101
1 2 hours with no word.

494
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:20,399
I don't get it.

495
00:29:20,472 --> 00:29:23,168
Why's their car still
sitting out in front?

496
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:25,334
Why didn't Willis
call for backup?

497
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,607
Because it wasn't Willis
who answered the hot line.

498
00:29:28,713 --> 00:29:30,112
You heard the recording.

499
00:29:30,182 --> 00:29:31,513
It was Willis' voice.

500
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:32,948
Forget it, Bruskin.

501
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:36,454
Plus which, the manager
just l.D.'d him and Scully.

502
00:29:36,521 --> 00:29:38,853
I said forget it,
Bruskin.

503
00:29:43,962 --> 00:29:48,365
This isn't one ofyour
X-File theories, is it?

504
00:29:49,468 --> 00:29:51,902
It doesn't matterwhat I think.

505
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,461
We're still after
the same thing.

506
00:29:56,975 --> 00:29:59,170
(phone bleeping)

507
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:02,107
Mulder.

508
00:30:02,214 --> 00:30:04,307
FBI centrex operator.
please hold.

509
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:05,474
Yeah.

510
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:06,812
Guess who, ace?

511
00:30:06,885 --> 00:30:08,318
Willis?

512
00:30:10,021 --> 00:30:13,320
That depends on whoyou ask,
don't it?

513
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:14,517
Where's Scully?

514
00:30:14,593 --> 00:30:16,788
You're the FBI

515
00:30:16,862 --> 00:30:19,228
you figure it out.

516
00:30:19,297 --> 00:30:21,162
Let me talk to her.

517
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:24,066
Yeah. Sure.

518
00:30:27,172 --> 00:30:28,400
Mulder?

519
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:29,599
Dana, areyou okay?

520
00:30:29,674 --> 00:30:30,572
Don't...

521
00:30:30,642 --> 00:30:31,609
Dana?

522
00:30:31,676 --> 00:30:33,234
Okay. That's it.

523
00:30:33,345 --> 00:30:34,778
Good-bye.

524
00:30:39,818 --> 00:30:41,877
It's not going
to work,Jack.

525
00:30:41,953 --> 00:30:43,853
You don't think so?

526
00:30:43,922 --> 00:30:46,857
Bureau policy
prohibits negotiating

527
00:30:46,925 --> 00:30:48,290
with kidnappers.

528
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,227
Butyou already know that,
don'tyou,Jack?

529
00:30:51,296 --> 00:30:53,093
Stop calling me that!

530
00:30:53,165 --> 00:30:55,065
Your name
isJackWillis.

531
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:58,125
You were born
February 23, 1 957.

532
00:30:58,203 --> 00:31:00,194
You live at 51 Stanhope...

533
00:31:00,272 --> 00:31:03,605
My name is WarrenJames Dupre

534
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:06,166
and I was born
in Klamath Falls, Oregon

535
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:07,870
in the Year ofthe Rat.

536
00:31:07,979 --> 00:31:12,177
We spent a weekend
up at Pine Barrens.

537
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,686
You taught me how to fish
through the ice.

538
00:31:15,787 --> 00:31:18,756
It was
your parents' cabin.

539
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:20,723
jack, try
to remember.

540
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:24,228
We drove up
in a snowstorm.

541
00:31:24,296 --> 00:31:26,321
Come on,Jack.

542
00:31:30,602 --> 00:31:33,469
Don't think I didn't see
whatyou did.

543
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:36,632
I was like a little slip
ofpaper up there

544
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:38,608
on that hospital ceiling.

545
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,234
I saw everything.

546
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:41,812
What did you see?

547
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,677
You left me to die
on that table

548
00:31:43,748 --> 00:31:45,477
whileyou tried
to saveyour friend!

549
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,651
You are my friend.

550
00:31:46,651 --> 00:31:47,345
You are my friend.

551
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:49,410
Too bad he was gone already.

552
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:50,818
I watched him go.

553
00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:54,222
just slipped away
down that long, black tunnel.

554
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:56,590
No. We broughtyou back.

555
00:31:56,661 --> 00:32:00,461
You shot me dead!

556
00:32:00,532 --> 00:32:03,865
And then you let me die.

557
00:32:03,969 --> 00:32:05,436
No.

558
00:32:05,503 --> 00:32:07,130
You won't kill me,Jack.

559
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:09,799
You call me that
one more time

560
00:32:09,908 --> 00:32:12,308
I'll makeyou stone-cold.

561
00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:14,345
Easy, baby, easy.

562
00:32:14,412 --> 00:32:15,777
Notyet.

563
00:32:15,847 --> 00:32:18,338
Remember,
she's our ticket.

564
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:31,361
Got any more
ofthis soda?

565
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:34,193
Lula:
Youjust drank
the last ofit.

566
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:35,893
Soda?

567
00:32:36,001 --> 00:32:38,196
How much ofthat haveyou had?

568
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:39,998
What's it toyou?

569
00:32:40,105 --> 00:32:42,039
jackWillis
is diabetic.

570
00:32:42,107 --> 00:32:43,574
Which means you're diabetic.

571
00:32:43,642 --> 00:32:46,702
Too much sugar in the system
could lead to hypoglycemia.

572
00:32:46,778 --> 00:32:49,508
Maybe that's why
your stomach's hurting so bad.

573
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:51,446
Abdominal pain
is the first sign

574
00:32:51,516 --> 00:32:54,485
ofimpending diabetic coma.

575
00:32:54,552 --> 00:32:56,611
You need insulin.

576
00:33:10,368 --> 00:33:13,337
Willis:
I feel myselfgetting
into their heads

577
00:33:13,405 --> 00:33:15,566
and I'm scared
bywhat I'm feeling.

578
00:33:15,674 --> 00:33:17,539
The intoxicating freedom

579
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:21,705
that comes from disconnecting
action and consequence.

580
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:26,217
Theirs is a world where nothing
matters but their own needs

581
00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:29,117
their own impossible appetites

582
00:33:29,187 --> 00:33:32,714
and while the pleasure they
derive from acts ofviolence

583
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:34,816
is clearly sexual

584
00:33:34,893 --> 00:33:37,794
it also speaks to what
WardenJackson called

585
00:33:37,862 --> 00:33:40,387
their operatic devotion
to each other.

586
00:33:40,465 --> 00:33:43,559
It's a love affair
I almost envy.

587
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:54,610
A drug store was reported
broken into right here

588
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:56,806
on the corner ofOld Forge Road
and Madison

589
00:33:56,881 --> 00:34:00,510
I'm betting Scully is somewhere
within this five-mile radius.

590
00:34:00,585 --> 00:34:02,052
Am I missing something?

591
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,350
200 units of N.P.H. insulin
were taken

592
00:34:04,422 --> 00:34:05,787
with a box ofsyringes.

593
00:34:05,857 --> 00:34:08,087
Willis is diabetic.

594
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,717
Get me a census report.

595
00:34:09,794 --> 00:34:13,525
Let's see how many households
we're talking about.

596
00:34:16,568 --> 00:34:17,762
Quick, quick, quick.

597
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:19,996
My legs are starting
to go numb.

598
00:34:20,105 --> 00:34:21,333
Hold on.

599
00:34:24,042 --> 00:34:25,532
What the hell..?

600
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:26,541
Drop the needle.

601
00:34:26,611 --> 00:34:29,136
Without this medicine, he dies.

602
00:34:29,214 --> 00:34:31,148
Yes, soyou said.

603
00:34:31,216 --> 00:34:34,151
Now, put it down

604
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:37,188
unless you want me
to putyou down with it.

605
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,724
What the hell
areyou doing, Lula?

606
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:44,557
I need that medicine.

607
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:46,957
You still haven't

608
00:34:47,031 --> 00:34:48,794
figured it out, haveyou?

609
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,663
Figured what out?

610
00:34:50,769 --> 00:34:53,101
It wasn't my brother
who setyou up.

611
00:34:57,175 --> 00:34:58,642
You?

612
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,043
Yeah. Me.

613
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:07,451
How doyou think
I got away so clean, huh?

614
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:09,510
The minuteyou stepped
into that bank

615
00:35:09,587 --> 00:35:10,713
I was out ofthere.

616
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:12,848
I got the money,
and I got rid ofyou.

617
00:35:12,924 --> 00:35:15,290
At least I thought I did.

618
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:20,996
(groans)

619
00:35:25,437 --> 00:35:26,995
(phone ringing)

620
00:35:27,105 --> 00:35:28,265
Tactical room.

621
00:35:28,373 --> 00:35:29,806
This is it.

622
00:35:31,709 --> 00:35:32,971
Mulder.

623
00:35:33,044 --> 00:35:34,602
Lula:
Listen carefully.

624
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:35,976
Where's Willis?

625
00:35:36,047 --> 00:35:38,538
Oh, he's lying
around here somewhere.

626
00:35:38,616 --> 00:35:39,981
Let me talk to Scully.

627
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:41,916
Not this time.

628
00:35:41,986 --> 00:35:43,715
We don't deal
unless we know

629
00:35:43,788 --> 00:35:44,812
Scully is alive.

630
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:46,117
She's alive.

631
00:35:46,191 --> 00:35:49,092
She's not happy,
but she's alive.

632
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,025
You listen to me--

633
00:35:51,095 --> 00:35:54,292
you lay one hand on Scully,
so help me, God.

634
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:55,957
Ifl wereyou,
I'd stop talking

635
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:58,501
and start passing
around the collection hat

636
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,038
'cause ifyou everwant
to see Scully again

637
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:03,437
it's going to costyou
a million dollars.

638
00:36:03,508 --> 00:36:05,442
Have it by this time tomorrow.

639
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,637
I'll tell you when and where.

640
00:36:08,613 --> 00:36:10,274
We got it.
It's a 202 number.

641
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:12,747
Great.

642
00:36:16,688 --> 00:36:18,087
Get the address.

643
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:19,418
Forget it.

644
00:36:19,491 --> 00:36:20,583
Why?

645
00:36:20,658 --> 00:36:22,888
It's Scully's cellular number.

646
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:24,826
They're using her phone.

647
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:26,454
We can't trace them.

648
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,972
Lulu: She's not happy,
but she's alive.

649
00:36:40,044 --> 00:36:42,569
Ifl wereyou, I'd stop talking

650
00:36:42,647 --> 00:36:44,808
and start passing around
the collection hat.

651
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:46,110
That last part, right?

652
00:36:46,217 --> 00:36:48,777
Yeah, but can you squelch
the voice even more?

653
00:36:48,887 --> 00:36:50,445
Yep.

654
00:36:50,555 --> 00:36:52,352
Done.

655
00:36:52,423 --> 00:36:54,755
Ifl wereyou, I'd stop talking

656
00:36:54,826 --> 00:36:57,693
and start passing around
the collection hat.

657
00:36:58,997 --> 00:37:01,090
Yep, yep,
there's something there.

658
00:37:01,165 --> 00:37:03,531
Definitely something
at the high end.

659
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:05,432
Let me throw on

660
00:37:05,503 --> 00:37:07,664
an extra Z-1 4 filter

661
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:11,175
and isolate everything
over halfa decibel.

662
00:37:11,242 --> 00:37:13,335
Ifl wereyou, I'd stop talking

663
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:15,606
and start passing around
the collection hat.

664
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,578
There.

665
00:37:16,648 --> 00:37:18,013
That engine sound.

666
00:37:18,116 --> 00:37:20,880
Let's clean it up some more.

667
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:28,625
Ifl wereyou, I'd stop talking

668
00:37:28,693 --> 00:37:30,718
and start passing around
the collection hat.

669
00:37:30,795 --> 00:37:33,025
Is that a small plane?

670
00:37:33,097 --> 00:37:35,395
Taking off, by the sound ofit.

671
00:37:35,466 --> 00:37:37,400
Give me a couple more minutes.

672
00:37:37,468 --> 00:37:39,333
We'll guesstimate the altitude

673
00:37:39,404 --> 00:37:41,998
within a couple 1 00 feet.

674
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:46,904
All right, people,
settle down and grab a seat.

675
00:37:46,978 --> 00:37:48,912
Mulder says
he's got something.

676
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,504
What? An alien virus

677
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:53,140
or new information
on the Kennedy assassination?

678
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:54,650
Hey, Mulder's all right.

679
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,118
You should pay attention.

680
00:37:56,187 --> 00:37:59,247
You might learn something
from the man.

681
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,352
We've identified what sounds
like light aircraft taking off.

682
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:08,228
Now, Washington County
Regional Airport

683
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:11,462
falls within our area,
just south ofthe state line.

684
00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:13,401
Since takeoffs
are north to south

685
00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:15,530
it's a fair bet
that our target area

686
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:17,302
Iies along this fight path.

687
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:20,105
For those ofyou
who remember ninth-grade math

688
00:38:20,178 --> 00:38:23,306
that gives usjust over
three square miles to cover--

689
00:38:23,381 --> 00:38:25,849
roughly 1 ,000 households.

690
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:28,511
With 1 00 law enforcement
officials at our disposal

691
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,054
at about 30 households
per man per hour

692
00:38:31,122 --> 00:38:34,421
we should be able to canvass
the area in three hours.

693
00:38:34,492 --> 00:38:36,960
Agent Bruskin
will grid the target area

694
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:38,996
and divide it
among the teams

695
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:42,089
and for those ofyou
who don't know already

696
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:45,658
this one's important to me,
so, uh, let's do it right.

697
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:46,999
Thanks.

698
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:48,766
Let me see Steinberg

699
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,468
Calder, and Westin.

700
00:38:57,548 --> 00:38:58,913
Scully?

701
00:38:59,017 --> 00:39:01,008
Hmm?

702
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,450
Huh?

703
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,750
Was there snow?

704
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:08,991
Yes,Jack.

705
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,029
There was lots ofsnow.

706
00:39:12,096 --> 00:39:14,257
I can't...

707
00:39:14,332 --> 00:39:16,892
It was December.

708
00:39:16,968 --> 00:39:19,562
It was the weekend
afterThanksgiving.

709
00:39:21,272 --> 00:39:24,173
I remember...

710
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:26,506
a red stove.

711
00:39:26,577 --> 00:39:28,135
Yeah. That's right.

712
00:39:28,212 --> 00:39:29,770
There was a...

713
00:39:29,847 --> 00:39:34,250
there was a wood-burning stove
right in the middle ofthe room.

714
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:36,843
Cold.

715
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:38,353
Yeah.

716
00:39:38,423 --> 00:39:40,857
So cold.

717
00:39:40,892 --> 00:39:45,192
I remember I had
to wrapyou in a blanket

718
00:39:45,263 --> 00:39:47,254
when the wood ran out.

719
00:39:47,331 --> 00:39:49,231
Yeah.

720
00:39:51,302 --> 00:39:52,735
No.

721
00:39:52,804 --> 00:39:55,568
jack, don't
closeyour eyes.

722
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,107
Come on, keep talking.

723
00:39:57,175 --> 00:39:59,370
jack, keep talking.

724
00:39:59,444 --> 00:40:00,308
Come on.

725
00:40:00,378 --> 00:40:02,141
Get down on the foor!

726
00:40:02,213 --> 00:40:03,043
Get over there!

727
00:40:03,114 --> 00:40:04,706
I'll execute all ofyou!

728
00:40:04,816 --> 00:40:05,612
No.

729
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,148
No.

730
00:40:07,218 --> 00:40:08,913

732
00:40:15,026 --> 00:40:16,357

00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:28,667

just a few minutes ofyour time.

738
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:38,014
Beautiful day, isn't it?

Go away.

742
00:40:49,393 --> 00:40:51,293
This is one-four.

743
00:40:51,362 --> 00:40:53,455
Target sighted.

744
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:04,772
Well, I guess it's time
to make that call.

745
00:41:05,743 --> 00:41:07,370
He's dead.

746
00:41:11,249 --> 00:41:13,342
It's all on you now.

747
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:15,612
He's dead because ofyou.

748
00:41:19,991 --> 00:41:23,154

750
00:41:24,896 --> 00:41:27,296

751
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:32,035
Don't move.

752
00:41:32,837 --> 00:41:33,701

753
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:35,136

754
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:36,797
I loveyou.

755
00:41:36,908 --> 00:41:39,502
Don'tyou know?

756
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:42,545
You're why I came back.

757
00:41:49,253 --> 00:41:50,652
This is Westin.

758
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:51,847
They battened down the hatches.

759
00:41:51,923 --> 00:41:54,892
There's no clear shot
from this side.

760
00:41:58,196 --> 00:41:59,094
Ditto.

761
00:41:59,163 --> 00:42:00,562
Hold your positions.

762
00:42:00,631 --> 00:42:02,496
Keep radios at two.

763
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:03,966
All right.

764
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,412
How do we look?

765
00:42:20,484 --> 00:42:21,815
Backup's in

766
00:42:21,886 --> 00:42:24,946
but we still don't know
what's going on in there.

767
00:42:25,022 --> 00:42:26,421
We will soon enough.

768
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,291
I kept a bottle ofmedicine
in the other room.

769
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:30,089
I kept a bottle ofmedicine
in the other room.

770
00:42:30,161 --> 00:42:31,628
I'll go get it.

771
00:42:31,696 --> 00:42:34,688
I'll get it foryou.

772
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:37,063
Look, look, look

773
00:42:37,134 --> 00:42:38,658
I loveyou.

774
00:42:38,736 --> 00:42:40,135
I loveyou, baby.

775
00:42:40,238 --> 00:42:41,136
No.

776
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:42,706
Listen, listen, listen.

777
00:42:42,773 --> 00:42:44,172
We still have her.

778
00:42:44,242 --> 00:42:46,403
We can get awaywith this.

779
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,977
I don't think so, baby.

780
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,603
Not this time.

781
00:42:49,714 --> 00:42:51,614
jack, put the gun down.

782
00:42:51,682 --> 00:42:54,617
You remember that...
Iight that I talked about?

783
00:42:54,685 --> 00:42:56,448
No.

784
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,249
It's beautiful.

785
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:03,227
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

786
00:43:03,294 --> 00:43:04,761
(gunshot)

787
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:06,797
No!

788
00:43:06,864 --> 00:43:08,297
All right, FBl!

789
00:43:08,366 --> 00:43:10,129

790
00:43:10,201 --> 00:43:11,793
FBl!

791
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:19,475
Areyou okay?

792
00:43:19,543 --> 00:43:21,101
jack!

793
00:43:40,231 --> 00:43:41,664
Hi.

794
00:43:41,732 --> 00:43:43,597
I got this from the morgue

795
00:43:43,668 --> 00:43:45,898
along with the rest
ofhis personal effects.

796
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:49,167
I thought
you might want it.

797
00:43:49,273 --> 00:43:52,436
" Happy 35th, love D."

798
00:43:52,543 --> 00:43:54,875
I got it for him
threeyears ago.

799
00:43:54,946 --> 00:43:56,971
Next ofkin?

800
00:43:57,048 --> 00:43:59,243
Uh... no.

801
00:43:59,317 --> 00:44:00,807
jackwas an only child.

802
00:44:00,885 --> 00:44:03,786
Both his parents died
when he was in college.

803
00:44:03,854 --> 00:44:05,879
There's a kid
over in Parklawn.

804
00:44:05,957 --> 00:44:07,857
jack's been his Big Brother

805
00:44:07,925 --> 00:44:11,861
so I'm going to go
and see him tomorrow.

806
00:44:11,929 --> 00:44:13,328
What am I going to tell him?

807
00:44:13,397 --> 00:44:15,422
The official story.

808
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:16,625
Which is?

809
00:44:16,701 --> 00:44:18,532
Fugitive Lula Phillips
died yesterday

810
00:44:18,602 --> 00:44:20,536
in a shoot-out
with federal agents

811
00:44:20,638 --> 00:44:23,471
which resulted in the death
ofSpecial AgentJackWillis--

812
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:25,634
killed in the line ofduty.

813
00:44:27,411 --> 00:44:30,346
(sighing)

814
00:44:31,682 --> 00:44:34,776
What am I supposed
to tell myself?

815
00:44:37,455 --> 00:44:39,946
Good night.

816
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,293
It's not working.

817
00:44:43,361 --> 00:44:45,261
It stopped.

818
00:44:46,697 --> 00:44:49,860
At 6:47.

819
00:44:49,934 --> 00:44:51,663
The exact time thatJack

820
00:44:51,736 --> 00:44:54,068
went into cardiac arrest
at the hospital.

821
00:44:54,171 --> 00:44:56,002
What does that mean?

822
00:44:56,107 --> 00:44:58,371
It means...

823
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:05,312
It means whatever
you want it to mean.

824
00:45:05,383 --> 00:45:07,476
Good night.
