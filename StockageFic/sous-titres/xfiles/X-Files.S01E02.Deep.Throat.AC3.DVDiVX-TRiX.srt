As soon as we're in position,
we'll be on a count offive.

2
00:00:15,034 --> 00:00:17,935
Excuse me.
That's my house.

3
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:20,837
- What's going on?
- Stand by. Mrs. Budahas?

4
00:00:20,907 --> 00:00:25,776
Your husband commandeered
a militaryvehicle and is armed.

5
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:27,005
Oh, my God.

6
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:48,733
You've got to let me
talk to him.

7
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:04,306
What the hell--

8
00:01:04,384 --> 00:01:07,820
We got him, but he's
going to need a doctor...

9
00:01:07,887 --> 00:01:10,014
or something.

10

( Breathing Heavily )

11
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:34,102
Hi. l gotyour message.

12
00:02:34,207 --> 00:02:36,732
Sorry for the runaround.
Can l buyyou a drink?

13
00:02:36,843 --> 00:02:39,437
lt's 2:00 in the afternoon,
Agent Mulder.

14
00:02:39,512 --> 00:02:42,447
That's not stopping
the rest ofthese people.

15
00:02:42,515 --> 00:02:44,312
l got something to showyou.

16
00:02:44,383 --> 00:02:46,817
Something you couldn't
show me at work?

17
00:02:46,886 --> 00:02:48,820
Let's get a table.

18
00:02:48,888 --> 00:02:50,685
Okay.

19
00:02:58,564 --> 00:03:00,828
Mulder:
That's Colonel Robert Budahas.

20
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,663
That photo was taken lastyear

21
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:05,101
when he was a test pilot
for the military

22
00:03:05,204 --> 00:03:06,899
stationed at Ellens Air Base.

23
00:03:07,006 --> 00:03:10,134
Four months ago, Budahas experienced
a psychotic episode

24
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:13,041
and barricaded himselfin his home.

25
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:15,945
The military police were called in.

26
00:03:16,015 --> 00:03:18,313
Budahas was removed and hospitalized

27
00:03:18,384 --> 00:03:20,352
for the treatment ofhis condition.

28
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:22,979
- Which was what?
- The militarywill not comment

29
00:03:23,055 --> 00:03:25,421
on the cause, nature or status.

30
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:30,554
- The militarywill not comment at all.
- What doyou mean?

31
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,657
Mrs. Budahas has neither seen nor heard
from her husband in over four months.

32
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:36,929
Her inquiries have gone unanswered.

33
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:39,494
Last month,
she contacted the F.B.l.

34
00:03:39,605 --> 00:03:41,698
and reported it
as a kidnapping.

35
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:44,901
What reason would the military have
to kidnap one oftheir own pilots?

36
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:48,572
That's the $64,000 question, Scully.

37
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:51,048
Since 1 963,
six pilots have been listed

38
00:03:51,117 --> 00:03:53,449
missing in action
from Ellens Air Base.

39
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,282
The militarywill say

40
00:03:55,354 --> 00:03:57,345
only that these pilots
accepted the risks

41
00:03:57,423 --> 00:03:59,357
offying experimental aircraft.

42
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:02,053
Yeah, there are rumors those pilots
were shot down at high altitudes

43
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:06,087
while theywere routinely
penetrating Russian airspace.

44
00:04:06,165 --> 00:04:08,963
There were other rumors too.

45
00:04:09,035 --> 00:04:10,730
l've been tracking this case

46
00:04:10,803 --> 00:04:13,966
since it came through
the Boise office last month.

47
00:04:14,073 --> 00:04:16,439
Last week, it was deprioritized.

48
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:19,842
They shelved this case
without an investigation, Scully.

49
00:04:19,912 --> 00:04:21,903
So--

50
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:25,940
So we're going to the Spud State
to investigate a kidnapping.

51
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:28,179
l don't get it, Mulder.

52
00:04:28,254 --> 00:04:31,280
Does this have something
to do with an X-File?

53
00:04:31,357 --> 00:04:35,123
l thoughtyou only liked
those paranormal-type cases.

54
00:04:35,194 --> 00:04:37,355
Am l missing something here?

55
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,491
Let'sjust say this case
has a distinct smell to it.

Excuse me.

59
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:11,385
Leave this case alone,
Agent Mulder.

60
00:05:11,464 --> 00:05:13,366
What?

61
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:16,764
The militarywill not tolerate
an F.B.l. investigation.

62
00:05:17,837 --> 00:05:19,566
Who areyou?

63
00:05:19,672 --> 00:05:23,130

in yourwork.

How doyou know about mywork?

67
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:32,379
Let'sjust say
that l'm in a position to know

68
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:37,445
quite a lot ofthings--
things about our government.

Who doyou work for?

lt's unimportant. l came here
to giveyou some valuable advice.

71
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,796
You are exposing yourself
and Agent Scully to unnecessary risk.

72
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:51,928
l adviseyou to drop the case.

73
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:54,199
l can't do that.

74
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:58,140
You have much work to do,
Agent Mulder.

75
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,941
Don'tjeopardize the future
ofyour own efforts.

76
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:25,765
You okay, Mulder?

77
00:06:25,871 --> 00:06:28,806
Yeah. l'm fine.

Scully: Mulder, l checked
on that fileyou gave me.

81
00:07:03,943 --> 00:07:06,912
You failed to tell me
a few things.

82
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:11,416
This isn't some U.F.O. goose chase
you're leading me on, is it?

00:07:13,753 --> 00:07:15,448
Yeah.

85

The Bureau has it out
for us already

86
00:07:18,424 --> 00:07:20,483
and it would make us appear
pretty stupid

read like some tabloid story.

to talk about it on this line.

- Yes.
- We're from the F.B.l.

Oh, yes. Please, come in.

94
00:08:02,368 --> 00:08:04,928
l started noticing it
about twoyears ago.

95
00:08:05,037 --> 00:08:07,505
Bob developed this rash
under his arms.

96
00:08:07,573 --> 00:08:10,371
We'd been doing
some renovations on the house

97
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:13,878
so we thought it was a reaction
to the paint stripper

98
00:08:13,946 --> 00:08:16,278
but then everything
just went crazy.

00:08:16,348 --> 00:08:18,282

How doyou mean?

100
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,877
Mrs. Budahas: Bob's whole personality--
it was so unpredictable.

101
00:08:21,954 --> 00:08:23,751
- He started doing things--
- What kinds ofthings?

102
00:08:23,823 --> 00:08:25,347
What kinds ofthings?

103
00:08:25,424 --> 00:08:28,393
Mrs. Budahas:
lt was kind ofembarrassing at first.

104

We were having
this dinner party once

105
00:08:31,297 --> 00:08:34,994

Tetrameal D all over his food.

106

Hmm?

107
00:08:37,036 --> 00:08:38,799
That's fish food fakes.

108
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:43,369
You ever talk to him about this?

109
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:46,605
l tried.
lt was extremely difficult.

110
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,840
Bob would get so angry, he'd...

111
00:08:48,914 --> 00:08:51,075
yell at the kids for no reason.

112
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:55,280
And then he would shake
like he was having a seizure.

113
00:08:55,354 --> 00:08:57,879
Did he ever talk about his work?

114
00:08:57,957 --> 00:09:01,188
lt was never discussed,
even before the problems.

115
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,094
l knew that he worked on top secret
projects-- word gets around--

116
00:09:05,164 --> 00:09:08,827
but Bob was always
a patriot first.

117
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:12,632
He took loyalty to his country
as an oath

118
00:09:12,738 --> 00:09:15,832
and now they treat us
like strangers--

119
00:09:18,911 --> 00:09:21,641
l just want my husband back.

120
00:09:21,714 --> 00:09:24,444
You know the government
is not above the law.

00:09:24,516 --> 00:09:27,451
They cannot
withhold information.

122
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,680
And then l think...

123
00:09:29,755 --> 00:09:32,519
well, what ifhe's--

124
00:09:32,591 --> 00:09:34,923
How would l support the family?

125
00:09:34,994 --> 00:09:37,963

- How long has he been--
- Almost twoyears.

132
00:10:06,492 --> 00:10:09,723

was his brother Hank's.

but when you're the wife
ofa test pilot

135
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:18,561
you thank God
just to have him home alive.

Mrs. McClennon

137
00:10:20,306 --> 00:10:24,037
has anyone ever offered
to explain what caused this?

138
00:10:24,109 --> 00:10:27,704
The stress, l guess.
You have to understand

139
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,443
the military deals with things
in a certain way.

140
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,280
They've given him plenty
oftherapy and treatment

141
00:10:34,386 --> 00:10:37,150
and l'm thankful for that.

So what did you make
of Uncle Fester?

151
00:11:11,156 --> 00:11:13,317
lt's called stereotypy.

152
00:11:13,392 --> 00:11:15,587

produced by stress.

to suffer from it.

Yeah, but these guys
are test pilots.

to fold under pressure.

Ever hear ofsomething
called the Aurora Project?

158
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,072
That's the unacknowledged code name

159
00:11:30,142 --> 00:11:33,270
for some defense department
surveillance project.

160
00:11:33,345 --> 00:11:35,939
They've been testing
a secret class

ofsuborbital spycraft
over the western U.S.

162
00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:41,916
Maybe these guys
are fying those planes.

00:11:41,987 --> 00:11:43,921
Maybe these guys
are the washouts.

out ofmyyard?

You ever seen a U.F.O.?

to one ofthose U.F.O. nuts

where would l go?

- Lasers, maybe--

and listen to some tunes

No. Our friend showed us the hole
in the fence about a year ago.

these bombs-- Whoa.

is supposedly one ofthe six sites where
parts ofthe wreckage were shipped.

No. Planes built
using U.F.O. technology.

a remarkable resemblance.

ofthese photos is authentic.

just because l can't explain it

00:24:57,215 --> 00:25:01,015
Lombardi's last game.
Why do l have to answer these questions?

348
00:25:01,085 --> 00:25:02,746
lt's not him.

349
00:25:08,693 --> 00:25:11,787
Colonel Budahas, you're a pilot,
isn't that right?

350
00:25:11,863 --> 00:25:15,060
- Yes, sir.
- Betyou've fownjust about
everything with two wings.

351
00:25:17,035 --> 00:25:19,003
l got this hotshot pilot friend

352
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,437
who said he could do an lmmelemann
at a sustained eight G's.

353
00:25:22,507 --> 00:25:24,566
ls that possible?

354
00:25:34,485 --> 00:25:36,544
l... l don't--

355
00:25:38,556 --> 00:25:40,217
l can't--

356
00:25:44,162 --> 00:25:46,653
Anita.

357
00:25:46,731 --> 00:25:49,894
l can't remember.

358
00:25:49,968 --> 00:25:52,129
No.

359
00:25:58,776 --> 00:26:01,574
Mulder, would you explain to me
what's going on?

360
00:26:01,646 --> 00:26:04,410
l think they rewired
that man's brain--

361
00:26:04,515 --> 00:26:06,506
some kind
ofselective memory drain.

362
00:26:06,618 --> 00:26:09,678
The brain doesn't work like that.
You can'tjust erase certain files.

363
00:26:09,787 --> 00:26:12,950
- Then you explain it.
- There are types ofamnesia--

364
00:26:13,024 --> 00:26:16,790
This is not amnesia. lt's something
far more deliberate and insidious.

365
00:26:16,861 --> 00:26:19,694
The science
or medical technology

366
00:26:19,764 --> 00:26:22,358
to do whatyou are suggesting
does not exist.

367
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:26,130
And neither does the technology to fy
the aircraft we saw last night.

368
00:26:26,204 --> 00:26:28,297
They can do this.

369
00:26:28,373 --> 00:26:30,898
That man should have known
the answer to the question.

370
00:26:30,975 --> 00:26:33,910
ltjust wasn't
in his head anymore.

371
00:26:35,446 --> 00:26:38,313
Scully:
Eveniftheycould, why would they?

372
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:40,884
To control information.

373
00:26:40,952 --> 00:26:44,945
l think after his psychotic episode
Colonel Budahas became a security risk.

374
00:26:45,056 --> 00:26:49,425
lt couldn't be that
he had a nervous breakdown
with a concomitant memory lapse?

375
00:26:49,494 --> 00:26:52,395
l think men like Colonel Budahas
are incapable

376
00:26:52,463 --> 00:26:56,627
ofdealing with the stress
offying that aircraft.

377
00:26:56,701 --> 00:27:00,034
We're talking about a technology
so sensitive and advanced

378
00:27:00,104 --> 00:27:02,902
that it's taken almost 50 years
to make it work.

379
00:27:02,974 --> 00:27:05,602
U.F.O. technology, Scully.

380
00:27:16,921 --> 00:27:18,548
- What the hell is this?
- Hold on!

381
00:27:29,968 --> 00:27:32,459
Please, step outofthe car.

382
00:27:32,537 --> 00:27:36,200
You think ifmaybe
we ignore him he'll go away?

383
00:27:36,274 --> 00:27:39,300
Please, step outofthe car.

384
00:27:39,377 --> 00:27:41,868
Guess not.

385
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,982
Special Agent Mulder, F.B.l.

386
00:27:48,052 --> 00:27:49,952
We're federal agents.

387
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,537
You want to tell me
what this is about?

388
00:28:14,712 --> 00:28:17,977
National security.
Now get in your car.

389
00:28:18,082 --> 00:28:20,710
You'll be escorted
back toyour motel.

390
00:28:20,818 --> 00:28:24,015
You'll pack and leave town immediately
or assume the consequences

391
00:28:24,088 --> 00:28:26,955
ofintense indiscretion.

392
00:28:29,594 --> 00:28:33,860
Nothing under
ldaho plate CC1 356?

393
00:28:33,931 --> 00:28:37,492
No plate registered
under that number?

394
00:28:37,535 --> 00:28:40,095
( Sighs )
Thanks, Gail.

395
00:28:40,171 --> 00:28:43,538
No, no, no. l'm sure
the other one's bogus too.

396
00:28:43,608 --> 00:28:45,542
Bye.

397
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:50,674
So who were those guys?

398
00:28:50,782 --> 00:28:53,114
l don't think it was those kids

399
00:28:53,184 --> 00:28:56,517
theywere chasing away
from the base last night.

400
00:28:56,587 --> 00:28:59,147
l think it was us.

401
00:28:59,223 --> 00:29:01,657
They knew we were coming
before we ever arrived

402
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:05,389
and they returned
Colonel Budahas as a decoy.

403
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:14,463
- There's something l didn't tell you.
- Something else?

404
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:19,442
A man in D.C. warned me
to stay away from this case.

405
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:23,105
He didn't give me his name
and my phone was being tapped.

406
00:29:23,214 --> 00:29:26,274
- What?
- Whywould they go to all this trouble?

407
00:29:26,384 --> 00:29:30,252
Out ofa need for security?
Security ofwhat?

408
00:29:36,394 --> 00:29:39,761
l think there's a huge
conspiracy here, Scully.

409
00:29:39,831 --> 00:29:43,790
They've got a U.F.O. here and
they'll do anything to keep it a secret

410
00:29:43,868 --> 00:29:48,134
including sacrificing lives
and minds ofpilots because
what ifthat secret got out?

411
00:29:48,206 --> 00:29:52,575
lf-- If-- that were true

412
00:29:52,643 --> 00:29:54,611
it would be a national scandal.

413
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:57,477
No. You're not thinking big enough.
lfit were true

414
00:29:57,582 --> 00:30:03,111
it would be confirmation of
the existence ofextraterrestrial life.

415
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:05,155
Did you ever stop to think

416
00:30:05,223 --> 00:30:08,886
that what we saw was simply
an experimental plane

417
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,697
like the Stealth Bomber
or this Aurora Project?

418
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,889
Doesn't the government
have a right

419
00:30:14,966 --> 00:30:17,628
and a responsibility
to protect its secrets?

420
00:30:17,702 --> 00:30:20,102
Yes, but at what cost?

421
00:30:20,204 --> 00:30:25,073
When does the human cost become too
high for the building ofa better machine?

422
00:30:25,143 --> 00:30:29,910
These are questions
we have no business asking.

423
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:33,473
Our kidnap victim
is no longer outstanding.

424
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:36,782
Let's get out ofhere, Mulder,
whileyou still have ajob.

425
00:30:40,491 --> 00:30:42,789
Aren'tyou even curious?

426
00:30:54,572 --> 00:30:57,097
Um... l'm going to shower,
l'll pack

427
00:30:57,208 --> 00:31:00,075
and then we'll get out ofhere.

428
00:31:14,692 --> 00:31:18,150
( EngineStarting )

429
00:31:19,297 --> 00:31:22,824
Mulder!
Where areyou going?

430
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,130
( TiresSquealing )

431
00:31:34,946 --> 00:31:36,880
Right here.

432
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,445
Hey, aren'tyou guys coming?

433
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,784
No. We've only gone
in at night.

434
00:31:44,855 --> 00:31:49,815
Okay. This spotyou told me about where
you watched the air show, how far is it?

435
00:31:49,894 --> 00:31:52,124
Uh... 45 minutes?

436
00:31:52,196 --> 00:31:55,461
- Will l be able to find it?
- Girl: Stay on the path.

437
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:58,866
What about this other place--
Yellow Base with the hangar there?

438
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,302
Don't.
lt's like... ten miles.

439
00:32:01,405 --> 00:32:04,670
Nobody's ever been that far!

440
00:32:04,742 --> 00:32:07,905
Hey, don't go past the edge
ofthe tall weeds.

441
00:32:10,147 --> 00:32:12,513
Oh, man.

442
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:16,451
Did we tell him about
the land mines andjunk?

443
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,454
Hey!

444
00:34:12,002 --> 00:34:13,993
Go, go!

445
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:29,579
- No!
- Come on. Hold him.

446
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,881
Yeah, l'm trying to make a call
to Washington, D.C.

447
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:39,055
and l can't seem to get
a long-distance line.

448
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,394
Hello? Hello?

449
00:34:47,338 --> 00:34:49,306
Excuse me.
My phone's not working.

450
00:34:49,373 --> 00:34:53,469
- Can l useyours to make
a credit card call, please?
- Sure thing.

451
00:34:53,577 --> 00:34:55,511
Thankyou.

452
00:35:02,286 --> 00:35:06,120
- This one's not working either.
- Phones are undependable around here.

453
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:11,389
People say it's
the military interference,
but they say that about everything.

454
00:35:11,462 --> 00:35:13,327
Thanks.

455
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:07,373
Hi. l wasjust looking foryou.

456
00:36:07,451 --> 00:36:10,978
l knocked,
but l saw the doorwas open.

457
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:14,489
l was in the lobby
trying to make a call.

458
00:36:14,558 --> 00:36:17,527
- Phones down again?
- Yeah.

459
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,638
Whatareyoudoing?

460
00:36:31,709 --> 00:36:33,643
( Tapping On Window )

461
00:36:33,711 --> 00:36:35,736
Excuseme.

462
00:36:35,813 --> 00:36:38,407
There'snothing in there.

463
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:50,693
( Grunting )

464
00:36:52,162 --> 00:36:54,130
( HammerCocking )

465
00:36:54,198 --> 00:36:57,395
Against the car!
Hands on the car! Do it!

466
00:36:57,468 --> 00:36:59,368
Put the gun down,
and we'll talk.

467
00:36:59,436 --> 00:37:01,370
l said hands against the car.

468
00:37:01,438 --> 00:37:03,633
Who areyou?

469
00:37:03,707 --> 00:37:07,507
You're a long way from home.
Nobodywants to come to violence now.

470
00:37:07,578 --> 00:37:09,671
Where's Mulder?

471
00:37:09,747 --> 00:37:13,342
- We took him to the base.
- We waited for him.

472
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:17,353
Get on that walkie-talkie
and find out where Mulder is.

473
00:37:17,454 --> 00:37:19,945
- l don't think l can.
- l thinkyou can

474
00:37:20,057 --> 00:37:25,222
or l'm going to have
every newspaperwriting
aboutyour experimental aircraft.

475
00:37:58,529 --> 00:38:01,657
There are otherways
to go about this.

476
00:38:01,732 --> 00:38:05,259
Yeah, l've already seen whereyou get
with tears and a sad story.

477
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:26,954
- (Man Over Walkie-Talkie)
- Roger.

478
00:38:31,595 --> 00:38:33,893
- What are we doing?
- Waiting.

479
00:38:33,964 --> 00:38:37,024
l want the car running.

480
00:38:37,101 --> 00:38:41,060
l said start the car!

481
00:38:41,138 --> 00:38:44,835
And putyour hands on the wheel
where l can see them.

482
00:38:48,746 --> 00:38:52,546
You do anything stupid and this
situation could get big in a hurry.

483
00:38:52,616 --> 00:38:54,948
Youjust keep
telling yourselfthat.

484
00:39:32,756 --> 00:39:34,656
Keep the car running

485
00:39:34,725 --> 00:39:37,159
and step out ofthe car.

486
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:55,275
Get in the car, Mulder.

487
00:39:57,815 --> 00:40:00,283
Get in the car!

488
00:40:09,727 --> 00:40:11,718
l just want to say

489
00:40:11,795 --> 00:40:15,390
everything you've seen here
is equal to the protection we give it.

490
00:40:15,466 --> 00:40:18,697
lt's you who have acted
inappropriately.

491
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:56,563
You okay, Mulder?

492
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,631
l think so.

493
00:41:05,315 --> 00:41:07,283
Scully, l--

494
00:41:10,187 --> 00:41:12,621
What?

495
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:17,586
How did l get here?

496
00:41:22,533 --> 00:41:24,728
- Mulder: Hi.
- Hello.

497
00:41:24,802 --> 00:41:27,737
We came by to see
howyour husband was doing.

498
00:41:27,805 --> 00:41:31,468
Oh, he's fine.
He's getting much better now.

499
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:33,908
Doyou think maybe
we could see him?

500
00:41:33,977 --> 00:41:37,242
Um, well, he's resting now.

Whoisitnow?

502
00:41:40,517 --> 00:41:43,918
Thankyou foryour concern.

503
00:41:48,258 --> 00:41:51,989
They got to her, Scully.
Theywere here.

504
00:41:52,062 --> 00:41:56,021
- They threatened her--
- That's enough, Mulder!

505
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:59,535
We don't know anything--

506
00:41:59,603 --> 00:42:02,834
anything more
than when we got here

507
00:42:02,906 --> 00:42:07,866
and that's what l'm going
to write in my field report.

508
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:10,038
Let's get out ofhere, Mulder

509
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:12,707
as fast as we can.

Barring further
authorizedinquiry...

523
00:43:44,942 --> 00:43:49,174
- Your lives may be in danger.
- Why?

524
00:43:49,246 --> 00:43:52,079
You've seen things
that weren't to be seen.

525
00:43:52,182 --> 00:43:57,017
Care and discretion
are now imperative.

526
00:43:57,087 --> 00:44:00,386
As l said, l can provideyou
with information

527
00:44:00,457 --> 00:44:03,153
but only so long
as it's in my best interest.

528
00:44:03,226 --> 00:44:06,627
- What is your interest?
- The truth.

529
00:44:08,498 --> 00:44:11,160
l did see something...

530
00:44:11,234 --> 00:44:13,634
but it's gone.

531
00:44:13,704 --> 00:44:18,300
They took it from me.
They erased it.

532
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:21,276
You have to tell me what it was.

533
00:44:21,345 --> 00:44:23,336
A military U.F.O.?

534
00:44:31,121 --> 00:44:34,784
Mr. Mulder,
why are those likeyourself

535
00:44:34,858 --> 00:44:37,725
who believe in the existence
ofextraterrestrial life

536
00:44:37,794 --> 00:44:42,595
on this Earth not dissuaded
by all the evidence to the contrary?

537
00:44:42,666 --> 00:44:48,070
Because all the evidence
to the contrary

538
00:44:48,138 --> 00:44:50,663
is not entirely dissuasive.

539
00:44:50,741 --> 00:44:53,175
Precisely.

540
00:44:56,213 --> 00:44:58,443
They're here, aren't they?

541
00:44:58,548 --> 00:45:03,042
Mr. Mulder, they've been here
for a long, long time.
