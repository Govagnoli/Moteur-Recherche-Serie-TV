Yes, but I wasn't able
to give him any information.

- The project he cited turned
up no viable evidence.

- Bee hives or bee husbandry.

323
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:13,474
- Into what ?
- Seven packages that
were sent from Canada...

324
00:36:13,551 --> 00:36:17,920
to a P.O. Box
in Payson, South Carolina.

325
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:21,083
I came here to find out
what was in those packages.

326
00:36:26,764 --> 00:36:29,062
You're a little late
to do anything about it.

327
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:32,193
So are you, apparently.

328
00:36:32,303 --> 00:36:36,899
What brought you here ?

329
00:36:37,008 --> 00:36:39,374
You came to me for information,
Mr. Skinner,

330
00:36:39,444 --> 00:36:43,710
but you still haven't told me
what you know about this.

331
00:36:43,781 --> 00:36:47,683
My office has to answer
to the Secretary General
of the United Nations.

332
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:50,915
This is a very serious matter.
I need to know what's going on.

333
00:36:56,895 --> 00:36:58,795
I think it's some kind
of experiment.

334
00:36:58,863 --> 00:37:01,798
- An experiment ?
- Using bees as carriers.

335
00:37:03,201 --> 00:37:05,863
And that's what
was in those packages ?

336
00:37:14,078 --> 00:37:16,569
- Have you told Agent Mulder this ?
- Not yet.

337
00:37:16,648 --> 00:37:18,673
- Why not ?
- I can't.

338
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,684
Why ?

339
00:37:24,222 --> 00:37:28,921
- Are you involved in this,
- Mr. Skinner ?
I didn't--

340
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:31,257
- No, I'm not involved.
- Then what are you doing here ?

341
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:35,594
- What aren’t you telling me,
Mr. Skinner ?
- Nothing.

342
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:39,626
If you know who's behind this,
you have to come forward,
Mr. Skinner. No one else can.

343
00:38:11,903 --> 00:38:13,962
Put the gun down
and move away from the desk.

344
00:38:14,072 --> 00:38:16,336
- I was just calling--
- I said put the gun down !

345
00:38:23,815 --> 00:38:27,080
[ Sighs ]
You don't understand.

346
00:38:27,151 --> 00:38:31,110
- No. I do now.
- No, you don't.

347
00:38:31,189 --> 00:38:34,647
- Is that the gun you used
to shoot the detective ?
- No.

348
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:37,422
- How does it feel to shoot
an innocent man in the head ?
- I didn't kill him !

349
00:38:37,495 --> 00:38:39,895
You're a liar !

350
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:42,159
You've been working
with the Smoking Man all along.

351
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:45,100
You knew when he had
my father killed, and you knew
when they took Scully.

352
00:38:45,203 --> 00:38:46,932
- Listen to me.
- I've heard enough of you.

353
00:38:47,038 --> 00:38:50,030
He set me up !
He stole my gun !

354
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:53,474
Then he put it back.
Which means the police are
probably on their way right now.

355
00:38:53,544 --> 00:38:56,411
- I don't believe you.
- Look at my desk drawer,
Agent Mulder.

356
00:38:57,849 --> 00:39:00,147
Look at it !

357
00:39:00,218 --> 00:39:03,085
Why would I force my own lock ?

358
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:11,424
If I lied to you--

359
00:39:14,198 --> 00:39:16,996
I have lied to you, and I won't
make excuses for those lies.

360
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:19,468
But there's a reason
I did what I did--

361
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,340
one that I think you’re in
a unique position to understand.

362
00:39:25,043 --> 00:39:30,743
I advised you against a certain
course of action some time ago...

363
00:39:30,815 --> 00:39:34,182
concerning Agent Scully.

364
00:39:36,354 --> 00:39:39,289
I didn't follow my own advice.

365
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,694
Give me the gun.

366
00:40:00,912 --> 00:40:04,905
How soon will you be able to
determine if that’s the weapon
that killed Detective Thomas ?

367
00:40:05,016 --> 00:40:08,918
As long as it takes me
to put one of these slugs
into a scope and run a comp.

368
00:40:08,986 --> 00:40:13,423
This is the slug we recovered
from the detective's body.

369
00:40:15,593 --> 00:40:18,790
You see this stria
here and here ?

370
00:40:18,863 --> 00:40:21,593
They're rifling patterns,
imprinted from the barrel
of the same gun.

371
00:40:23,101 --> 00:40:25,626
So this is definitely
the murder weapon ?

372
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:28,900
If I were called to testify,
I’d say without a doubt.

373
00:40:31,075 --> 00:40:33,100
So where'd you find it ?

374
00:40:36,247 --> 00:40:41,116
In a sewer grate,
around the corner
from the crime scene.

375
00:40:41,185 --> 00:40:44,177
- Mm.
- Sometimes you get lucky.

376
00:40:44,255 --> 00:40:46,621
- Sometimes you don't, right ?
- What do you mean ?

377
00:40:49,994 --> 00:40:52,428
The serial number--
it's been filed clean off.

378
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:58,662
Now, unless forensics pulled a print,
this gun's virtually untraceable.

379
00:41:22,426 --> 00:41:24,394
[Skinner]
Leave it off.

380
00:41:27,331 --> 00:41:29,322
I'm starting to get used
to the dark.

381
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,392
- Is this part of our deal ?
- We never had a deal.

382
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:36,270
- No ?
- Agent Scully is dying,
and you haven't done a thing.

383
00:41:39,877 --> 00:41:43,040
- You think that's funny ?
-Just enjoying the irony,
Mr. Skinner.

384
00:41:43,147 --> 00:41:46,412
Only yesterday you said
you wouldn't be party to murder.

385
00:41:46,484 --> 00:41:48,884
And now here you are.

386
00:41:51,155 --> 00:41:54,124
Yours isn't the first gun
I've had pointed in my face,
Mr. Skinner.

387
00:41:57,528 --> 00:42:00,793
I'm not afraid to die.

388
00:42:00,865 --> 00:42:03,390
But if you kill me now,
you'll also kill Agent Scully.

389
00:42:03,467 --> 00:42:06,300
You have no intention
of saving her. You never did.

390
00:42:07,705 --> 00:42:10,765
Are you certain ?

391
00:42:10,842 --> 00:42:15,142
I saved her life once before
when I had her returned
to Agent Mulder.

392
00:42:15,246 --> 00:42:17,180
I may save her life again.

393
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:21,817
But you’ll never know if you
pull the trigger, will you ?

394
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:27,817
[phone Ringing]

395
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:32,987
Now, unless you intend to kill me,
I'd like to answer my phone.

396
00:42:33,064 --> 00:42:34,998
[Ringing Continues]

397
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:45,809
[Ringing Continues]

398
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:05,695
[ Ringing Continues ]

399
00:43:14,138 --> 00:43:16,072
Yes.

400
00:43:18,609 --> 00:43:21,100
He was just here.

401
00:43:21,212 --> 00:43:23,146
He threatened to kill me.

402
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,349
I'm sure Mulder
will be contacting you.

403
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:32,719
He'll want to know if Skinner
has seen all there is to see.

404
00:43:35,826 --> 00:43:37,794
I'll tell him what
you want me to tell him.

405
00:43:45,303 --> 00:43:47,737
Tell him
what he wants to hear.

406
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
