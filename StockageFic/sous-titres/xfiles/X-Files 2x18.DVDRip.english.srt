Hurry up! Get an ambulance!

18
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,469
This is Wesley Brewer out on route seven.

19
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,950
Looks like about an eight o'clock ETA
on that trailer pick-up.

20
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,068
- This fog's gonna slow me down.
- <i>10-4, Wesley. See you when you get here.</i>

21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,152

<i>(elephant moans)</i>

27
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,315
So you saw nothing when the window broke?

28
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,719
- No.
- Nothing.

29
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,394
We heard a noise, like thunder.

30
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,554
Then glass everywhere.

31
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,790
OK. Thank you.

32
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,316
- What'd the janitors say?
- They claim they didn't see anything.

33
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,870
The security monitors don't have
a recording of anything either.

34
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,350
Just a giant implosion of glass
like some kind of giant shock wave.

35
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,079
What they described
sounds more like a sonic boom.

36
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,549
Well, no sonic boom did this.

37
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,311
The construction worker who was killed
had his spine crushed like a string of shells.

38
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,837
A circular abrasion on his torso in
roughly the shape of an elephant's foot.

39
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,550
Other workers said they felt the ground
shake, then a faint whiff of animal odour.

40
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,277
If you still think the elephant did this,
it defies logic. Somebody would have seen it.

41
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,670
Well, if somebody would have seen it,
Scully, we wouldn't be here.

42
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,990
Another vehicle would have left evidence -

43
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,470
distress to the metal or paint.
I can see signs of neither.

44
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,553
I'd admit the possibility of a tornado,
but it's not really tornado season.

45
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,394
I'd even entertain the notion
of a black hole passing over the area...

46
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,393
...or some cosmic anomaly, but it's
not really black-hole season either.

47
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,790
If I was a betting man,
I'd say that it was, um...

48
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,677
An invisible elephant?

49
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,070
I saw David Copperfield make
the Statue of Liberty disappear.

50
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,197
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah.

51
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,033
Ed Meecham, Fairfield Zoo.
Sorry for the hold-up.

52
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,680
We had trouble transporting Ganesha's body.

53
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,512
- This is Agent Scully.
- Hi.

54
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,351
- Have they determined what he died of?
- She. She was a 12-year-old Indian female.

55
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,000
I figure she ran herself into exhaustion.

56
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,753
- How did she escape?
- Well, now, there's a puzzle.

57
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,516
When I got the call, I expected to find her
cage open, but it was locked, just like I left it.

58
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,355
- Any idea how she could have escaped?
- No, sir. No signs of tampering either.

59
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,989
I've read about something called
"the elephant rebellion" in zoos.

60
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,277
Elephants turning on their keepers,
destroying their pens.

61
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,309
- Was Ganesha ever a problem like that?
- Elephants are very big, very wilful animals.

62
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,471
So you're saying there were problems?

63
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,597
The person you wanna talk to
about that is Willa Ambrose.

64
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,517
- Ambrose?
- She's a naturalist.

65
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,229
She was hired by the board of supervisors
last year to oversee things.

66
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,675
<i>She's</i> supposed to be the reigning authority.

67
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,515
In your opinion, the damage here, could this
have been caused by an escaped elephant?

68
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,591
My honest opinion? Sure.

69
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,311
Excuse me.

70
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,629
- What you looking for, Mulder?
- A local paper.

71
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,712
I wanna see if David Copperfield's in town.

72
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,310
Excuse me. We're looking for Willa Ambrose.

73
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,960
- There.
- Thank you.

74
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,189
- Miss Ambrose?
- Yes.

75
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,477
I'm Agent Dana Scully. This is Agent Mulder.
We're with the FBI.

76
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,519
- How can I help you?
- A federal employee has been fatally injured.

77
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,751
There is a case around
the elephant that escaped from your zoo.

78
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,233
I understood that the eyewitnesses said
they didn't know how the man was killed.

79
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,232
What we're trying to determine
is how Ganesha escaped.

80
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,632
- What did Ed tell you?
- He found the cage locked, as he'd left it.

81
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,474
- What more can I say?
- A man was found trampled to death.

82
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,949
An animal from your zoo
was found 43 miles away.

83
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,637
No one's looking to place any blame.
We're just trying to understand the facts.

84
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,957
This is where Ganesha was held
when she wasn't in her habitat.

85
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,430
- Who has keys to this lock?
- Only myself and Mr Meecham.

86
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,360
Otherwise, this is a restricted area.

87
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,996
Elephants aren't good jumpers,
if that's what you're thinking.

88
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,119
No. I was wondering why such
a small pen for such a large animal.

89
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,432
The zoo was built in the 1940s.
The pens and habitats are all too confining.

90
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,832
I was brought on to expand
and create more humane environments.

91
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,195
Unfortunately, these things take time.

92
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,069
- Those, uh... chains on the ground there?
- Those are tie-downs.

93
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,353
They restrict the animal's movement.
I disallowed their use when I came here.

94
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,477
- Disallowed their use by whom?
- It was Ed Meecham's practice.

95
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,269
It reflected an old,
non-progressive zoo policy.

96
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,560
- How's your relationship with Ed Meecham?
- I'm his boss and a woman. Ed doesn't like it.

97
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,030
Would he be vindictive enough
to let Ganesha go as sabotage?

98
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,478
If he did, that would be foolish. The facility is
running at a deficit and may lose its funding.

99
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,154
- Have you discussed the incident with Ed?
- No.

100
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,993
I think Ed's got enough
dealing with the WAO.

101
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,868
- The WAO?
- It's the Wild Again Organisation.

102
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,430
They believe any captive animal
is a crime against nature.

103
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,398
They're gonna have a field day with this one.

104
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,471
<i>(Willa)</i> Excuse me.

105
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,675
The WAO believes only tragedy results
from keeping animals in captivity.

106
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,719
In the wild, an elephant would roam
an area of 20 square miles minimum.

107
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,033
Ganesha weighed over 5,000 pounds and
she was being held in a 50- by 50-foot cage.

108
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,079
- You consider that inhumane?
- It's like you or I living in a pickle barrel.

109
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,119
FBI files state you've been arrested
over a dozen times for the kidnapping...

110
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,875
...of circus and zoo animals.
- The WAO sees it as liberation.

111
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,479
Hm.

112
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,199
Were you involved
in the "liberation" of Ganesha?

113
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,750
That would make me an accessory
to murder, wouldn't it?

114
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,391
Endangering these animals
is against everything we believe.

115
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,074
These are incredibly spiritual creatures.

116
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,631
Their rituals and behaviour are linked
to a past no man ever witnessed.

117
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,188
Did you know they actually bury their dead?

118
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,158
They can visit
an elephant graveyard centuries old...

119
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,312
...and know instinctively
where their ancestors' bones lie.

120
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,960
What do you think
Ganesha was running from?

121
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,555
You wanna see? I'll show you.

122
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,635
<i>Get up! Halt. I got him.</i>

123
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,632
This is how Ed Meecham
treats these majestic animals.

124
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,110
- This is still going on?
- Meecham's a barbarian.

125
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,636
He's been torturing animals
at the Fairfield Zoo for years.

126
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,395
We figure he's still at it.
Eventually we're gonna get some proof.

127
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,869
We're here to put pressure on the zoo.
We're keeping track of what goes on.

128
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,350
Willa Ambrose claims she's put a stop
to most of his old practices.

129
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,070
Whatever her intentions, she's too
preoccupied to know how Meecham operates.

130
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,196
Preoccupied with what?

131
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,229
A lawsuit she's fighting against the Malawi
government over a gorilla named Sophie.

132
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,235
Willa rescued her from an African customs
house ten years ago. Raised her like a child.

133
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,552
- The Malawi government wants her back.
- Will they win?

134
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,349
This is a perfect example of man's
imperialism over the animal kingdom.

135
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,797
Some craven impulse to turn animals
into objects for our own selfish pleasure.

136
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,232
- I thought you said she rescued this gorilla?
- So she could spend her life behind bars!

137
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,394
Her obligation should have been to return the
gorilla to the wild. Animals should run free.

138
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,433
- Even if it means trampling a man to death?
- Maybe he should have moved.

139
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,149
I'm sure he would have
if he'd seen it coming.

140
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,116
Thanks for your time, sir,
and we'll get back to you soon.

141
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,395
- It's all happening at the zoo, Scully.
- Well, we found our suspects.

142
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,314
- You think they busted out Ganesha?
- You heard him. "Animals should run free."

143
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,836
What about the eyewitness accounts,
the security tapes...

144
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,993
...the fact that no one saw an elephant
until it was miles away from the zoo?

145
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,073
The lights at the construction site
were mercury-vapour, 10,000 candlepower.

146
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,072
They can restrict a man's ability
to adjust to the dark.

147
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,390
And their security cameras are poor quality.

148
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,075
A grey elephant may not have registered
an image on tape in the dim light.

149
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,674
I'm not buying it.
I think these guys are all talk.

150
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,639
These guys are dedicated to exactly
this kind of activity, unabashedly.

151
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,917
- Did you check out the night-vision camera?
- No.

152
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,436
It wouldn't surprise me if they tried
to capitalise on their success.

153
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,637
- By doing what?
- By liberating another animal.

154
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,553
Willa Ambrose said
the zoo was in trouble financially.

155
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,316
The loss of another big exhibit
could shut them down entirely.

156
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,550
All right. You keep an eye on the WAO.

157
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,070
And where are you going?

158
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,151
To talk to the animals.

159
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,148
<i>Beam me up, Scotty!</i>

160
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,879
Did anybody tell you
the camera loves you, Frohike?

161
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,430
<i>Yeah, the arresting officers</i>
<i>at the Free James Brown rally.</i>

162
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,638
- <i>What's this costing the taxpayers, Mulder?</i>
- Uh... about a 150 bucks an hour.

163
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,951
<i>Ouch! Almost as much</i>
<i>as Bill Clinton's haircuts.</i>

164
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,634
- Where's Langly?
- <i>He has a philosophical issue...</i>

165
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,631
<i>... with having his image transmitted.</i>

166
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,315
- <i>What are you doing in Idaho?</i>
- I'm in Fairfield. What do you know about it?

167
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,996
<i>They got a little zoo there. Lots of strange</i>
<i>lore. Animals escaping, disappearing.</i>

168
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,789
- Any idea why?
- <i>You're near the Mountain Home Air Base.</i>

169
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,552
<i>Major UFO hotspot.</i>

170
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,872
<i>Weird fact, Mulder: No animal at Fairfield Zoo</i>
<i>has ever brought a pregnancy to term.</i>

171
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,837
<i>(Frohike) Not a cub or a chick.</i>

172
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,153
<i>The woman in charge has a gorilla that knows</i>
<i>sign language, supposedly a thousand words.</i>

173
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,198
- <i>(phone rings)</i>
- <i>If that's the lovely Agent Scully...</i>

174
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,431
<i>... let her know I've been working out. I'm buff.</i>

175
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,389
- Mulder.
- Mulder, it's me.

176
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,393
I was right. I just followed
the kid from the WAO to the zoo.

177
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,279
He's just about to make it over the fence.

178
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,834
All right. I'll be right there, Scully.

179
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,833
<i>(gasps)</i>

180
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,396
What the hell are you doing here?

181
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,472
There's a member of
the WAO on the premises.

182
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,551
Come with me.

183
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,595
<i>(growling)</i>

184
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,431
<i>(growling)</i>

<i>(squawking)</i>

187
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,075
<i>(cacophony of animal cries)</i>

188
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,755
<i>(Scully)</i> What's going on?

189
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,115
OK, Sophie. Calm down.

190
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,272
<i>(cacophony continues)</i>

191
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,791
<i>(snarling)</i>

192
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,951
<i>(snarling)</i>

00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,920
- <i>(vicious snarling)</i>
- <i>(man screams)</i>

194
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,874
- <i>(snarling)</i>
- <i>(man screams)</i>

195
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,950
I don't know what you're talking about.

196
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,873
You have no idea
what he was doing at the zoo?

197
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,758
If you're asking if I had
any idea of his intentions...

198
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,308
...the answer is simple: Not the slightest.

199
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,710
I saw this camera sitting up there
on the shelf yesterday.

200
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,631
Guess I never noticed it before.

201
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,355
A tiger is missing
and a member of your organisation is dead.

202
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,513
For such a principled man,
you show an amazing lack of emotion.

203
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,233
If the tiger killed this person,
then it was a natural act.

204
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,119
If I find evidence that he was releasing
those animals under your orders...

205
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,873
...you'll spend the rest
of your life behind bars.

206
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,520
Scully?

207
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,510
That guy really pisses me off.

208
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,477
- Are you OK, Scully?
- Yeah.

209
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,551
Have you calmed down?

210
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,796
- Have they found the tiger yet?
- No. But I took a look at the cassette.

211
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,269
- He wasn't killed by the tiger.
- What?

212
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,035
Unless it's trick photography,
it was some kind of phantom attacker.

213
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,432
You saw his body! He was mauled to death.
He had claw marks on his chest and back.

214
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,115
I can't explain it, either.
But I know someone who might be able to.

215
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,634
Excuse me? Miss Ambrose?

216
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,915
Can we have a word with you?

217
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,709
I don't know anything more than
I've told the police. I have nothing to say.

218
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,268
Is this where you keep Sophie?

219
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,829
- Sophie is ill.
- Do you think we could meet her?

220
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,033
We're not here
to try to take her away from you.

221
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,631
<i>(moans)</i>

222
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,951
Six weeks ago I had to take
Sophie out of her public habitat.

223
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,679
She'd become so withdrawn and depressed.

224
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,435
She'd curl into a ball in the corner
of her cage and just shiver.

225
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,353
- Did you ask her why?
- All the time.

226
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,398
- What did she say?
- Light afraid.

227
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,870
- Literally, she's afraid of the light.
- She speaks to you?

228
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,351
Over 600 words using American Sign
Language. She understands over a thousand.

229
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,079
I'll show you her vocabulary list.

230
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,994
- Is this who you wanted to speak to?
- It's basic investigative procedure.

231
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,995
- Interview all the possible witnesses.
- Gorillas are highly sensitive creatures and...

232
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,277
...Sophie's use of language skills
makes her even more so.

233
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,309
- Why would she be afraid of the light?
- You've heard about the Malawi government.

234
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,154
Sophie could be taken away from me
and I think that she knows that.

235
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,231
- Are these Sophie's?
- Yes.

236
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,231
What do you think they mean?

237
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,357
Until recently,
Sophie desperately wanted a baby.

238
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,672
The brown object in the centre
is her expression of that.

239
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,832
- Have you tried to mate her?
- We were looking for a partner...

240
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,755
...but under these stressful conditions,
I didn't wanna put her through it.

241
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,673
- Do you have a veterinary facility here?
- Yeah.

242
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,435
This is a strange request, but it might
help to explain what's been going on.

243
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,592
I'm gonna need your help on this, too, Scully.

244
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,157
- I hope you know what you're getting us into.
- I'm pretty sure of what we're gonna find.

245
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,515
This isn't exactly in my job description.

246
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,149
Next thing you know
they'll be doing it on MTV Sports.

247
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,118
OK, the elephant's cavity is clear.

248
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,191
I'm ready for you.

249
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,753
- The knife's right down there.
- OK.

250
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,628
I was told there's never been a successful
pregnancy at the Fairfield Zoo.

251
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,269
- You've been talking to Kyle Lang.
- Well, is it true?

252
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,239
Yes. But I don't think
for the reasons Kyle claims.

253
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,153
Not because Ed Meecham
has done anything to the animals.

254
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,834
- Why then?
- Bringing a pregnancy to term...

255
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,993
...in captivity is always difficult.
- But a perfect failure rate?

256
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,868
I know. It's one of the things I was
determined to change when I came here.

257
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,155
Was an attempt ever made to mate Ganesha?

258
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,471
No. Mating an elephant
out of the wild is rarely successful.

259
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:57,237
There have only been six elephants
born in captivity over the last ten years.

260
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,750
Here's the uterine tissue. But I'm still
not clear on what you expect to find.

261
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,473
You're right, Mulder. The signs in
the uterus and the ovaries are unmistakable.

262
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,028
<i>(Willa)</i> So, what did you find?

263
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,509
This animal had been pregnant.

264
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,433
- What are you talking about?
- There's hypoplasia...

265
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,556
...and the corpus luteum is ruptured.

266
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,553
- <i>(Willa)</i> That's not possible.
- Neither is an invisible elephant.

267
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,392
- What is going on here?
- Whatever it is, it's been going on a while.

268
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,950
I think you'll find evidence
of the same thing when your tiger returns.

269
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,920
I still can't believe
you bet on the Chargers!

270
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,070
<i>(growling)</i>

271
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,038
- You hear that?
- Hear what?

272
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,111
<i>(snarling)</i>

273
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,397
- Where's the tiger?
- Inside the site. Two men are trapped.

274
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,471
Put the gun away, Ed!

275
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,835
Do you wanna be responsible
for another death?

276
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,388
We can capture this cat
without harming anyone.

277
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,393
- This is no time for wishful thinking.
- I'm ordering you, Ed.

278
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,229
Yes, ma'am. Lead the way.

279
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,277
<i>(Scully)</i> How'd the tiger get across town
without being spotted?

280
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,399
<i>(Mulder)</i> I don't know, but we'd better
find her before Meecham does.

281
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,518
Hey! Shh, shh.

282
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,989
It was just here.

283
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,231
- <i>(Willa screams)</i>
- <i>(gunshot)</i>

284
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,393
It's all right, Willa.

285
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,994
They don't all talk and draw pictures.

286
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,553
This last incident has left the board
with no choice but to withdraw all funding.

287
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,552
If that's your decision,
there's nothing else I can say.

288
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,831
<i>(board member)</i> I'm sorry.

289
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,834
It really is a shame. It's too bad.

290
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,831
I'm out of ajob.

291
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,157
They've cut off all funding.

292
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,153
The animals are being shipped out
to other zoos, starting Monday.

293
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,074
- I'm sorry.
- It could not have happened at a worse time.

294
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,471
You mean for Sophie?

295
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:04,395
What I had going for me was
my position here. Having a place for her.

296
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,550
Have the results come in on the tiger?

297
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,598
Agent Scully did the test.
The tiger had been pregnant, too.

298
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,389
It's impossible. There's no chance
those animals could get pregnant.

299
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,789
What if they were artificially inseminated?

300
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,872
That's a very fine and complex process.
I would have known.

301
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,076
Unless it was done somewhere else.

302
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,516
- Where?
- What do you know about alien abduction?

303
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,229
You're... You're kidding me?

304
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,149
You think that these animals
were taken aboard some spaceship?

305
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,630
I don't know, but there's obviously
some problem getting them back.

306
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,350
Due to what may be an astrological variation,
a trouble with the time-space continuum.

307
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,230
These animals taken from cages are returned
two miles west-southwest of this zoo.

308
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,110
- Aliens impregnating zoo animals.
- Yes, and harvesting the embryos.

309
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,395
- Why?
- Maybe their own Noah's Ark?

310
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,472
To preserve the DNA
of these animals that we're depleting.

311
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,712
That's probably why you've never had
a successful birth at this facility.

312
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,155
It's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

313
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:10,189
I understand that you might think it's
ridiculous. Maybe you should ask Sophie.

314
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,078
You think... this is what she's so afraid of?

315
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:17,517
I believe she's pregnant.
And she's afraid of them coming for her baby.

316
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,118
<i>(Willa)</i> Sophie, come here.

317
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,869
I wanna ask you a question.

318
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,315
It's OK, Sophie.

319
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,068
Come here.

320
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,629
- What's she saying?
- She says "man, woman hurt."

321
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,474

are going to hurt her or me.

Sophie. Man woman are here to help you.

323
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,230
They want to know about Sophie's baby.

325
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,630
- Can I ask her a question?
- Yeah.

326
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,553
Will you ask her if she wants to leave here?

327
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,311
Sophie.

328
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,789
Do you want to leave here?

329
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,194
She says "light afraid".

330
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,669
Sophie, what are you afraid of?

331
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,031
<i>(Willa)</i> Tell me.

332
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:26,270
- <i>(Mulder)</i> What did she say?
- She said "Baby go flying light".

333
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,873
<i>(knock at door)</i>

334
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,313
<i>(door opens)</i>

335
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,597
I just finished off in the infirmary.

336
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,036
The sheriff's deputy came
looking to serve you papers.

337
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,475
I think it's about Sophie.

338
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,552
- What am I gonna do?
- You can't leave Sophie here...

339
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,712
...if you want to protect her.
- I've nowhere else to take her.

340
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,995
- <i>(knock at door)</i>
- Excuse me.

341
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,395
- Willa Ambrose?
- Yes.

342
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,600
I'm serving you with a court order
to release Sophie into protective custody.

343
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,878
- What are you doing here?
- I've come to ask for your help, Kyle.

344
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,558
- Help with what?
- Sophie.

345
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,358
- They've taken her into protective custody.
- Let her go, Willa.

346
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:48,997
They're putting her in an iron cage
as we speak, without bars, without windows.

347
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,911
It'll kill her.

348
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,233
Sophie's been behind bars her entire life. Let
her go home, to the freedom she deserves.

349
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,836
Freedom to what? Be killed by poachers
and have her hands cut off as souvenirs?

350
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:06,199
- They promised she'll be in a preserve.
- She's mine, Kyle. I won't let her go!

351
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,919
Please, come on.
We can find a place for her here.

352
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,355
- A private reserve. You know people.
- No. No.

353
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,829
That's against everything I stand for.

354
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,357
She's pregnant.

355
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,512
- What?
- Sophie's pregnant.

356
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,791
I don't believe you, Willa.

357
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,671
- It's true.
- What if she was?

358
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,638
Is the baby gonna live out
its life behind bars, too?

359
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,316
Look, Willa, she doesn't belong to you.
She's not your child.

360
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,712
She belongs with other gorillas,
not selling tickets for a zoo.

361
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,949
You won't help me?

362
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,837
No.

- Where d'you get this?

366
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:21,036
I was looking for a pen to finish my report
in Willa's office and that was in her drawer.

370
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,237
I'm with you.

371
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,031
I love you, too.

372
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,911
Willa?

373
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,116
Willa? Are you here?

374
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,951
Willa, where are you?

375
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,391
Willa?

- <i>(grunting)</i>

378
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,634
I told you. It happened exactly
the way it did with the tiger.

379
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,236
I heard the animals going crazy. I got up
to check on Sophie and she was gone.

380
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,834
That's when I found Kyle.

381
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,708
- Any idea what he was doing at the zoo?
- No.

382
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:33,112
A witness says that you visited
Kyle's office yesterday. Is that true?

383
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,599
Yeah.

384
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,798
- For what purpose?
- Basically, to tell him that he'd won...

385
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,237
...the zoo was being shut down and Sophie
was being taken into protective custody.

386
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,313
Did you ask him to help you take Sophie
to prevent her from being taken from you?

387
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,712
No. That would be against
everything Kyle believed in.

388
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,554
But he helped you to rescue her
originally, isn't that correct?

389
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,519
He had a connection to you and to
this animal that went back several years.

390
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,991
Whatever "connection" he and I had...
was over long ago.

391
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,800
But you asked him anyway... to help you?

392
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,872
No.

393
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,556
Then what was he doing here last night
and why did he give you this note?

394
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,514
I don't know. I told you.

395
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,111
- Did he make a habit of visiting the zoo?
- If he did, it was probably late at night...

396
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,510
...after he'd jumped over the fence
like a good WAO soldier.

397
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,752
Why don't you ask Agent Mulder what he
thinks happened? He has a novel theory.

398
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,798
Maybe it was alien abduction.

399
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,394
Scully, can I talk to you for a second?

400
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,631
- You think she's telling the truth.
- Why do you say that?

401
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,872
Kyle Lang's death and the disappearance
of the animal match the previous incidents.

402
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,154
Yes.

403
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,312
And you've been pushing
this alien abduction angle.

404
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,632
- I still am, but Willa's reactions are wrong.
- To losing Sophie?

405
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,872
I think she knows where Sophie is and Lang
died cos he knows what she's capable of.

406
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,635
- You think <i>she</i> killed him?
- I think she'd do anything to protect Sophie.

407
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,349
Even wait atop a stack of crates
for her former lover to walk underneath?

408
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,439
An examination of the body will give us
a picture of what happened last night.

409
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,273
You do that and I'll check out the warehouse.

410
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,111
<i>(thud)</i>

411
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,915
- Looks like you're in a hurry.
- Well, there isn't much to hang around for.

412
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,991
I'm afraid there is.

413
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,437
I found evidence
that Kyle died a wrongful death.

414
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,630
He was hit with a cattle prod.

415
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,111
There's gonna be an investigation,
so I have to read you your rights.

416
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,391
It was an accident.

417
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,590
Kyle surprised Ed.

418
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,472
- He wasn't supposed to be there.
- Ed Meecham took Sophie?

419
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,551
Yes.

420
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,676
There was no one else to turn to.

421
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,991
Where is she, Willa?

422
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,149
Ed has her.

423
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,791
She's in some building...
on the road to Boise.

424
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,832
Put it down, Ed. There's been
enough violence, don't you think?

425
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,508
- I didn't kill Kyle Lang.
- Put down the gun and we'll talk about it.

426
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,160
I was only doing what she paid me to do.

427
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,230
- Where's the animal, Ed?
- Down the hall.

428
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,313
You show me where.
We're gonna go there together. Come on.

00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,509

Take your tranquilliser gun.
I'll be right behind you.

I've only got one dart in this thing,
so you gotta get her out in the light.

00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,232
- Where is she?
- She's gone.

454
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,313
- What did he do to her?
- It wasn't Ed. She tried to tell me something.

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,230
- What is that?
- That doesn't make any sense.

456
