1
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:21,928
Dr. Longenhahn,
here's the body.

2
00:00:24,404 --> 00:00:26,770
They weren't kidding,
were they?

3
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,774
They said they did about
the best they could...

4
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:31,106
considering he was all mashed
in with that garbage.

5
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:33,404
( grunts )

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,448
How mashed up is he?

7
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:37,450
Basically, it's hamburger.

8
00:00:40,754 --> 00:00:42,688
Oh.

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,494
And they want me
to do what exactly?

10
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:53,090
The order was to establish
and confiirm real fact of death.

11
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,359
I'd say he's dead.
How about you?

12
00:00:56,436 --> 00:00:58,666
- Yes, sir.
- Good. I'm going home.

13
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,140
You fax me the paperwork by 9:00,
I'll sign it, everybody's happy.

14
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,474
Oh, cryin' out loud.
See this?

15
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:13,418
They left some garbage
in with it.

16
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:20,682
Looks kinda like a vertebrae,
only metallic.

17
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:27,731
Note it on the report.

18
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:29,735
Then fax me.

19
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:58,449
Oh, God.

20
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:00,686
I was hoping
this was all a dream.

21
00:03:03,163 --> 00:03:06,860
- When'd the sun come up?
- About six hours ago.

22
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:11,529
- Somewhere back in North Carolina.
- Where are we?

23
00:03:11,571 --> 00:03:14,563
We just crossed
into Georgia.

24
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:18,133
A long way from home,
Agent Scully.

25
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:21,078
Under the circumstances.

26
00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:26,145
Right.
We can't be too safe.

27
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:30,085
Are you all right,
Agent Reyes?

28
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:33,092
I should ask
how you're doing.

29
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:36,095
I mean, you're the one
who's gonna have this baby.

30
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:38,188
That's it, isn't it?

31
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:42,201
What you're really
worried about?

32
00:03:43,637 --> 00:03:47,004
Aside from whatever
danger we're in...

33
00:03:47,073 --> 00:03:49,633
where we're going
doesn't sound like...

34
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:51,940
there's all that much
in the way of a facility.

35
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,508
You know what I mean?

36
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,813
I-- I've never
delivered a baby.

37
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:03,986
Well, I've never had one.
That makes us both beginners.

38
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,692
MULDER: This is a videograph
from the D.C. Morgue.

39
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:17,737
- It's Billy Miles.
- How can that be?

40
00:04:17,804 --> 00:04:19,931
It can't be.
It's impossible.

41
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:22,133
Yeah, it can't be,
but it is...

42
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,541
walking out of the morgue
lookin' like a new man.

43
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:27,774
His body was taken to the morgue
in a little box, for God's sake.

44
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:31,681
Like I told ya,
you can't stop him.

45
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:34,777
Yeah, you know, you keep
saying that, Krycek.

46
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:37,880
Why don't you explain it
to us because I'm having
a little bit of a hard time...

47
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:39,892
understanding it myself.

48
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:42,759
Billy Miles was scraped out of
the back of a garbage truck.

49
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:45,593
I saw him go in.
I saw him come out.

50
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:52,265
Well, I don't know if I can explain it
in any technical sense, but...

51
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:57,066
that's Billy Miles
without a doubt.

52
00:04:57,143 --> 00:05:00,772
You're sitting there for one reason,
Krycek, because you can't explain it.

53
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:03,647
I told you
he's a human replacement.

54
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:06,083
Some new kind of alien...

55
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:10,616
created to aid in
the repopulation of the planet.

56
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,353
- Which Scully's a threat to.
- If she has that baby.

57
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:17,825
I don't care who he is or what
you think he's made of...

58
00:05:17,897 --> 00:05:19,888
there's no way
he's gonna fiind her, no way.

59
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:24,335
Well, maybe he's not, but there
are others out there just like him.

60
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:30,833
And it's only a matter of time
before they will.

61
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:33,368
( knocking )

62
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:37,310
Agent Doggett?
See you a moment?

63
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:45,190
There's someone here
to see you.

64
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:53,632
CRANE:
The name is Knowle Rohrer.

65
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,191
He says you know each other
and what he's here for can't wait.

66
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,658
End of the road.

67
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,660
Yeah, literally.

68
00:06:22,662 --> 00:06:26,120
If anybody fiinds us out here,
it really will be a miracle.

69
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:32,032
- Where exactly are we?
- Democrat Hot Springs.

70
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:35,336
According to Agent Doggett,
this is where people used to
come for their waters...

71
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,366
until the springs dried up
and they quit coming.

72
00:06:37,444 --> 00:06:40,675
- He was born here.
- Really.

73
00:06:40,747 --> 00:06:43,079
Well, that's comforting.

74
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:45,447
I guess.

75
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:49,883
- So where do you want to set up?
- Over here.

76
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:55,117
Any particular reason?

77
00:06:55,195 --> 00:06:58,494
I think I told you I feel these energies
about people and stuff...

78
00:06:58,732 --> 00:07:00,495
and places.

79
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:03,066
I found it works best
to go with my instincts.

80
00:07:22,822 --> 00:07:25,290
I'm getting
a feeling myself.

81
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:33,899
( squeaks )

82
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:38,396
Well, there's no water
from this rock.

83
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:42,908
We're gonna need some water
and a place to boil it.

84
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:47,242
Along with sterile supplies
and a clean place to do this delivery.

85
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:53,013
I'm a little stiff
from the drive.

86
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,124
Okay.

87
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:27,346
It's not like you, Knowle.

88
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,821
Comin' to see me when you make me
work so hard to see you.

89
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:34,850
This couldn't wait,John.
It's about this thing you're pursuing.

90
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:37,829
- This thing?
- This man you're after.

91
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:40,492
I think you know
what I'm talking about.

92
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:44,035
I think I'm confused,
Knowle...

93
00:08:44,103 --> 00:08:46,594
if it's a man
or it's a thing.

94
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,138
This is military,John.
Goes all the way to the top.

95
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:51,837
I can't overstate
the sensitivity.

96
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:59,075
Let me say there was a rumored
program out of the Cold War...

97
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:01,177
planned to create
a super soldier.

98
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:05,156
Well, this kid I'm talking about
was pretty damn super.

99
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:07,955
Got right up out of a gut bucket
and hit the ground running.

100
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:11,929
The kid wasn't exactly
what I'd call military material.

101
00:09:11,998 --> 00:09:14,967
In fact, they say
he was an alien abductee.

102
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:18,003
- You got it half right,John.
- Which half?

103
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:21,472
What you're chasing...
is a prototype.

104
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,066
Uh-huh.

105
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:26,976
And this
so-called prototype...

106
00:09:28,648 --> 00:09:32,140
- what is he after?
- I think you know that too,John.

107
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:34,152
He's after
your partner Scully.

108
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:39,581
You may not be aware that
she was part of a program herself.

109
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:42,958
Six years ago, Agent Scully was
taken in a military operation...

110
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:45,088
staged as an abduction.

111
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:49,260
They put a chip in the back
of her neck to monitor her.

112
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:51,667
It was also used
to make her pregnant...

113
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:56,035
with the fiirst organicversion
of that same super soldier.

114
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,046
( chuckles )

115
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,878
What do you want from me?

116
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:06,385
Help us catch him
so we can put him down...

117
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:08,386
before he fiinds her.

118
00:10:08,454 --> 00:10:11,082
You assume
I know where she is.

119
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:14,092
Who does, your superior?

120
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:18,262
Whoever knows,
his life is in danger too.

121
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:20,265
I want you to know.

122
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:40,485
( bell dings )

123
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:54,065
Sit down, Krycek!

124
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:07,069
Hey, what did I tell you?

125
00:11:07,146 --> 00:11:09,080
Hey!

126
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:16,689
SKINNER:
Krycek!

127
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:21,421
Krycek, hold the door!

128
00:11:24,564 --> 00:11:26,657
Hold the door, Krycek!
Krycek!

129
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:36,433
( elevator whirring )

130
00:11:58,464 --> 00:12:00,091
Mulder.

131
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:13,268
You heard
about this, right?

132
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:15,314
- How is he?
- He's got a concussion.

133
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:18,010
They're gonna keep him here
for observation.

134
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:20,018
Where were you
when this all happened?

135
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:23,578
In my offiice, talking to somebody
who warned me this might happen.

136
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:25,180
Who?

137
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:27,226
( sighs )

138
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:31,127
Skinner could have been killed.
He's lucky he wasn't.

139
00:12:31,197 --> 00:12:35,293
He's an old friend. He tells me
stuff I'm not supposed to know.

140
00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:39,464
- I didn't wanna believe it.
- What exactly did he tell you?

141
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:41,564
He said that Billy Miles
isn't what you think he is.

142
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:44,701
He's a product of a government program
lookin' to build a super soldier.

143
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:47,178
He said Agent Scully's
a part of that program too.

144
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:49,806
And her pregnancy was triggered
by a chip they put in her neck.

145
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:52,210
I want to know who the hell
you've been talking to!

146
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,083
Who this trusted source of yours is,
who's been spinning this fantasy.

147
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:05,427
His name's Knowle Rohrer.
He's deep inside U.S. Intelligence

148
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:08,332
- I don't know much more than that.
- Did he ever lie to you?

149
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:10,494
Give you bad information?
False leads?

150
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:16,071
- You have to think about it?
- He said Scully's in danger.

151
00:13:16,142 --> 00:13:18,736
He wants to stop this guy. How's that
so different from what we're saying?

152
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:21,780
You didn't tell him
where she is, did you?

153
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:25,375
No. But I'm beginning to think
that the fact that I know...

154
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:27,885
is gonna catch up with me
if A.D. Skinner's any indication.

155
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:30,555
You don't tell anybody where she is.
That's the deal, right?

156
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:32,557
Not even me.

157
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,321
What if something
happens to me?

158
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,265
This, uh, trusted source
of yours...

159
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:44,701
told you he knows
how to stop Billy Miles.

160
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:48,195
Did he happen to tell you
how he plans to do this?

161
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:52,110
- No.
- Right.

162
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:56,342
What do you say you and me go fiind
out how trustworthy he really is?

163
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:02,712
Dana, come see
what you think.

164
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:11,857
Oh, my goodness!

165
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:13,899
Look at this.

166
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:15,901
Look at you.

167
00:14:18,337 --> 00:14:20,271
Wow!

168
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:36,512
I found them folded up
in a cabinet upstairs...

169
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:39,786
and a nice porcelain basin
and a whole box of candles.

170
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:42,191
Do we have matches?

171
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:46,220
- I've got a lighter.
- Yeah.

172
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:48,631
Now all we need
is some mood music.

173
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:51,796
- Like ""Whale Song.""
- ""Whale Song""?

174
00:14:51,837 --> 00:14:56,274
They've got these recordings
of whales talking to each other,
calling back and forth.

175
00:14:56,342 --> 00:15:00,438
( imitating whale calls )

176
00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:06,444
I-I don't know, it's like,
it's almost metaphysical.

177
00:15:09,822 --> 00:15:12,188
You're looking at me like--

178
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:14,386
I don't know.
I probably sound like a goof.

179
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,587
No, no, it's not that.

180
00:15:16,662 --> 00:15:21,565
Um, I was thinking that you reminded
me of someone that I was close to.

181
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:24,797
- My sister.
- You're not close to her still?

182
00:15:25,938 --> 00:15:29,965
Uh, she was killed
about fiive years ago...

183
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:31,972
in my home.

184
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:39,477
It was a terrible time.

185
00:15:44,223 --> 00:15:46,282
Well, it's, uh, it's okay.

186
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:49,795
I want to thank you.

187
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:52,353
Thank you for...

188
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:54,626
putting this together.

189
00:15:56,235 --> 00:16:01,730
It's not what I planned,
but, um, it's very nice.

190
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:07,506
What?

191
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,344
There's someone out there.
Stay here.

192
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:57,922
Get out of the car!
I'm a federal agent!

193
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:08,600
I don't care who you are.

194
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:12,077
Let's start by putting
that weapon away.

195
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:14,939
Just point it down now.

196
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:21,711
- I'm a federal agent.
- I heard you the fiirst time.

197
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:25,086
Just let me see
some identifiication.

198
00:17:36,936 --> 00:17:39,839
Dana?

199
00:17:42,341 --> 00:17:46,971
I'm sure this looks untoward,
but my life is in danger.

200
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:49,071
And my baby's.

201
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:54,017
There's a man who's pursuing us
and it is very important
that he not fiind us here.

202
00:17:54,086 --> 00:17:56,748
We get hunters in here...

203
00:17:56,822 --> 00:18:00,690
taking deer and game
off-season.

204
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,161
I've heard every excuse in the book,
but this one's far too original.

205
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:09,158
You don't plan
to have it here?

206
00:18:09,368 --> 00:18:11,461
It's not as crazy
as it sounds.

207
00:18:11,537 --> 00:18:13,971
I mean, I hope it's not.
She's a doctor. She can coach me.

208
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:17,634
And what if something goes wrong?
If you're a doctor, you know the risks.

209
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,373
- You're unprepared here.
- This man...

210
00:18:22,448 --> 00:18:24,939
he's extremely dangerous.

211
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:37,087
I got a fiirst-aid kit
in my truck.

212
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:40,621
It's pretty basic,
but better to have than not.

213
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:44,430
I'll be back with some towels
and the proper swaddling.

214
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:45,970
Thank you.

215
00:19:02,087 --> 00:19:04,112
and then when we want to reach him,
all of a sudden, he's unreachable...

216
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,752
- nowhere to be found.
- Maybe he got wind.
Maybe he got spooked.

217
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:11,729
But I'm beginning to think it doesn't
make a damn bit of difference.

218
00:19:11,797 --> 00:19:15,563
You told me that he told you
he knew how to stop Billy Miles.

219
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:18,068
Are you telling me now
that you think he's a liar?

220
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:21,903
He is or he isn't. What the hell
difference does it really make?

221
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:23,908
It doesn't make
any difference at all...

222
00:19:23,976 --> 00:19:27,002
unless you wanna protect
Scully and that baby.

223
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:29,674
And then what?

224
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:34,675
How long can you
keep this up?

225
00:19:34,753 --> 00:19:37,449
How long until the next Billy Miles
rears his head? The next threat?

226
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:39,923
The next phantom?

227
00:19:39,992 --> 00:19:42,017
Do you ever stop
to ask yourself?

228
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:47,524
All the sacrifiice,
the blood spill.

229
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,228
You've given nearly
a decade of your life.

230
00:19:52,838 --> 00:19:55,238
Where the hell
is it all gonna end?

231
00:19:56,942 --> 00:20:00,673
I don't know.
Maybe it doesn't.

232
00:20:04,283 --> 00:20:08,652
( tires squealing )

233
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:11,918
- Start the car.
- What?

234
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:13,959
- Alex Krycek just pulled in.
- ( car engine starts )

235
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:33,010
What the hell's he doing here?
How did he get security clearance?

236
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:36,071
Do you recognize
his passenger?

237
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:40,676
Yeah, it's Knowle Rohrer.

238
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:55,066
Thank you.

239
00:20:56,135 --> 00:20:58,262
Thank you.

240
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:05,976
I have to say, with everything
I know you must be feeling...

241
00:21:06,045 --> 00:21:08,912
you look amazingly
beautiful, Dana.

242
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:16,980
And what about
what you're feeling?

243
00:21:19,058 --> 00:21:22,323
Any vibrations, Agent Reyes?

244
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:27,758
- I don't know.
- What?

245
00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:30,926
I don't know if I'm
just being paranoid...

246
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:34,639
but something feels off.

247
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:39,777
We need some more water.

248
00:22:45,844 --> 00:22:47,812
( gunshot )

249
00:22:49,348 --> 00:22:51,748
( gun cocks )

250
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:16,966
Go back inside, Dana!

251
00:23:19,878 --> 00:23:22,278
Who is it?

252
00:23:24,116 --> 00:23:26,084
Dana, it's okay.
He's dead.

253
00:23:27,853 --> 00:23:29,787
No, it's not okay.
What do you mean?

254
00:23:29,855 --> 00:23:32,824
Exactly what I said. Now go on inside.
We'll take care of this.

255
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:35,155
They said that
he couldn't be stopped.

256
00:23:35,227 --> 00:23:39,755
Dana, he's got no vitals.
He's lost too much blood.

257
00:23:49,942 --> 00:23:51,876
Is this the man
you're afraid of?

258
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:55,507
How did he
fiind you out here?

259
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:59,884
I do have to
report this thing.

260
00:23:59,952 --> 00:24:03,251
- No, you can't do that.
- I don't have any real choice.

261
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:08,316
No, I mean,
I-I just felt a contraction.

262
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,134
Something's happening.

263
00:24:19,772 --> 00:24:24,175
- Where's he going?
- Not to see you, that's for sure.

264
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:26,177
Who the hell's
he going to see?

265
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:31,745
You go ahead.
I got Krycek.

266
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:00,945
( elevator bell dings )

267
00:25:23,902 --> 00:25:25,870
( knocking )

268
00:25:37,316 --> 00:25:39,511
( chattering )

269
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:18,155
Agent Doggett?

270
00:26:19,224 --> 00:26:21,419
( hangs up phone )

271
00:26:21,493 --> 00:26:24,223
- What are you doing here?
- They let me out of
the hospital tonight.

272
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:26,662
What are you doing here?

273
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:29,891
I got Mulder down in the parking
garage watching Alex Krycek.

274
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:31,902
What the hell
is Krycek doing here?

275
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,530
- That's what I'm trying to fiigure out.
- ( phone rings )

276
00:26:36,408 --> 00:26:38,968
- Yeah?
- He's here with Agent Crane.

277
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:42,309
Agent Crane? How the hell
does he know Agent Crane?

278
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:44,576
That's a damn good question.
He doesn't.

279
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,450
You been wondering who's getting
these guys past security, how
Billy Miles is in the F.B.I.?

280
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,956
Agent Crane is in on this
with your friend, which means
he's in on it with Krycek.

281
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:55,084
- They've been in on it all along.
- I don't understand. In on what?

282
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,185
Fooling us, Agent Doggett.

283
00:26:57,262 --> 00:27:01,062
Into chasing after Billy Miles.
Into believing we could protect her.

284
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:03,590
- Scully?
- Yes, they know where she is.

285
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:06,900
- No, no. Only I know where she is.
- You and Agent Reyes.

286
00:27:06,972 --> 00:27:09,634
You called her from a phone
inside the F.B.I., didn't you?

287
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:12,006
There's no way Crane
can tap calls in here, Mulder.

288
00:27:12,077 --> 00:27:14,068
He'd have to have access
to the communications system.

289
00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:16,979
- Skinner's here with me.
- Maybe this goes even higher.

290
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:18,983
Listen to me,
I got to get to Scully.

291
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:21,315
You gotta tell me where she is,
where you sent her.

292
00:27:21,386 --> 00:27:24,287
Look, we can nail these guys here,
Mulder. We can put an end to it.

293
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:27,120
No, you listen. You gotta get out
of there. You got no guarantee...

294
00:27:27,192 --> 00:27:30,286
that these guys
aren't alien replacements too.

295
00:27:33,632 --> 00:27:37,295
Northern Georgia. A place called
Democrat Hot Springs.

296
00:27:42,174 --> 00:27:44,233
Mulder!

297
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,514
( cocks gun )

298
00:27:52,684 --> 00:27:54,618
Get out of the car.

299
00:28:04,496 --> 00:28:06,487
Doesn't seem fair now.

300
00:28:06,565 --> 00:28:08,726
Doesn't seem right.

301
00:28:10,435 --> 00:28:12,369
Coming down to this.

302
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:15,304
What do you know about fair or right,
Krycek? You're a coward.

303
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:20,171
I could've killed you so many times,
Mulder. You gotta know that.

304
00:28:22,114 --> 00:28:24,582
I'm the one
that kept you alive.

305
00:28:27,686 --> 00:28:30,177
Praying you'd win somehow.

306
00:28:30,255 --> 00:28:32,746
Then there
really is no God.

307
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:36,483
You think I'm bad,
that I'm a killer.

308
00:28:36,561 --> 00:28:40,156
We wanted the same thing, brother.
That's what you don't understand.

309
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:43,258
I wanted to stop them.

310
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:46,702
All you wanted was
to save your own ass.

311
00:28:46,738 --> 00:28:48,729
No.

312
00:28:48,807 --> 00:28:50,741
I tried to stop them.

313
00:28:52,577 --> 00:28:55,603
Tried to kill Scully's baby
to stop them.

314
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,081
It's too late.

315
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:02,643
The tragedy is that you--
you wouldn't let it go.

316
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:08,282
That's why I have to do this.

317
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,158
'Cause you know
how deep it goes.

318
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:14,357
Right into the F.B.I.

319
00:29:15,634 --> 00:29:19,126
You wanna kill me,
Alex, kill me.

320
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:22,498
Like you killed my father.

321
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:28,179
Just don't insult me
trying to make me understand.

322
00:29:39,491 --> 00:29:44,485
- ( gunshot )
- ( groaning )

323
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,466
( breathing heavily )

324
00:29:57,075 --> 00:30:00,203
( screaming )

325
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:18,695
( groaning )

326
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,602
It's gonna take more bullets
than you can...

327
00:30:28,673 --> 00:30:31,233
ever fiire
to win this game.

328
00:30:32,677 --> 00:30:35,578
But one bullet...

329
00:30:35,647 --> 00:30:37,774
and I can give you
a thousand lives.

330
00:30:44,756 --> 00:30:46,189
Shoot Mulder.

331
00:31:15,954 --> 00:31:20,152
I'm going to go to the airport. I need
that location from Agent Doggett.

332
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:27,660
- Skinner, are you with me?
- You just go. I'll get him.

333
00:31:32,404 --> 00:31:34,338
( car engine starts )

334
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:47,685
( groaning )

335
00:31:47,752 --> 00:31:50,846
They're two minutes apart now.
It's not going to be long.

336
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,482
- How's this?
- That's great.

337
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:21,581
( elevator bell dings )

338
00:32:22,787 --> 00:32:25,381
Right there!
Both of you!

339
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:32,330
I'm prepared to use force!

340
00:33:02,294 --> 00:33:04,262
- Come on. Come on!
- Agent Doggett.

341
00:33:12,437 --> 00:33:14,371
Here you go.

342
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:18,609
Thank you.

343
00:33:24,015 --> 00:33:25,949
Thank you.

344
00:33:27,352 --> 00:33:29,479
- ( screams )
- Move!

345
00:33:29,554 --> 00:33:31,613
Agent Reyes, what?

346
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,624
Move out of here!

347
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:35,990
What's happening?

348
00:33:39,464 --> 00:33:41,398
Who are you?

349
00:33:50,842 --> 00:33:53,743
This baby will be born.

350
00:34:13,732 --> 00:34:15,700
SCULLY:
Agent Reyes!

351
00:34:18,436 --> 00:34:20,404
The Blazer!

352
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:26,768
Get Mulder on the phone.

353
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:31,872
( tires squealing )

354
00:34:37,622 --> 00:34:40,147
( tires squealing )

355
00:34:53,171 --> 00:34:57,733
What's happening?
Huh? What?

356
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:01,108
- It's okay, Dana.
- What? No!

357
00:35:01,146 --> 00:35:04,673
- It's going to be okay.
- No!

358
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:09,982
( breathing heavily,
screams )

359
00:35:13,425 --> 00:35:15,450
Get him off!.

360
00:35:20,832 --> 00:35:25,462
- This is my baby!
- You gotta push, Dana!

361
00:35:25,537 --> 00:35:28,131
( grimaces )
Please don't let them take it!

362
00:35:38,016 --> 00:35:40,712
- Come on, Dana. Push!
- God!

363
00:35:44,456 --> 00:35:47,050
SCULLY:
Please don't let this happen.

364
00:35:47,091 --> 00:35:49,821
- Dana, push!
- It's mine!

365
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,531
Hold on!

366
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:21,585
- ( yelling )
- Harder! Push, Dana!

367
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:25,220
- Keep breathing, Dana.
Keep breathing.
- Please don't let them take it!

368
00:36:25,463 --> 00:36:28,455
Push! Push!

369
00:36:29,968 --> 00:36:33,995
- Push, Dana, push!
- ( screams )

370
00:36:34,072 --> 00:36:37,269
( baby crying )

371
00:36:50,922 --> 00:36:55,552
( baby continues crying )

372
00:36:59,297 --> 00:37:02,858
Down there.
Get me down there.

373
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:26,953
Scully. Scully!

374
00:37:29,827 --> 00:37:34,196
Where is she?
Scully!

375
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:40,065
Where is she?
Scully!

376
00:37:41,806 --> 00:37:45,640
- Where is she? Tell me where she is!
- Mulder!

377
00:37:48,012 --> 00:37:52,210
- How is she?
- She's inside.

378
00:37:52,283 --> 00:37:55,013
She needs to get
to the hospital.

379
00:38:01,926 --> 00:38:05,225
I'm to take
this story seriously?

380
00:38:05,296 --> 00:38:08,732
These incidents
at the F.B.I.

381
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,268
This account
of Agent Scully's birth.

382
00:38:11,336 --> 00:38:14,772
I'm to submit this report
as quality investigative work?

383
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:17,239
As representative
of actual fact?

384
00:38:18,276 --> 00:38:20,107
I signed
the report there, sir.

385
00:38:20,178 --> 00:38:24,137
Yeah, I see it,John.
And I see her signature here too.

386
00:38:25,783 --> 00:38:28,911
On an X-File.

387
00:38:28,987 --> 00:38:31,581
I'd like to know when you
assigned yourself, Agent Reyes?

388
00:38:31,656 --> 00:38:33,954
Agent Doggett
assigned me, sir.

389
00:38:33,992 --> 00:38:37,155
Agent Doggett cannot just assume
the authority of this offiice.

390
00:38:37,228 --> 00:38:40,823
I assume it because this offiice
is under investigation...

391
00:38:40,898 --> 00:38:44,231
for the late-night meeting
between you, Agent Crane...

392
00:38:44,302 --> 00:38:46,770
and an intelligence operative
named Knowle Rohrer.

393
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:51,036
Both men were presumed dead,
but are now missing.

394
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:53,976
In actual fact.

395
00:39:10,261 --> 00:39:13,924
You investigate
what I tell you.

396
00:39:15,233 --> 00:39:18,134
And you put me
on the X-Files.

397
00:39:18,202 --> 00:39:20,170
That's what
I'm investigating.

398
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:55,769
- Get some rest.
- Yeah.

399
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:58,241
- We didn't hear you come in.
- We were just dropping off gifts.

400
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:00,903
- We just wanted to--
- See it with your own eyes.

401
00:40:00,978 --> 00:40:04,106
It's incredible, you know?
You arriving in time to save Scully.

402
00:40:04,148 --> 00:40:07,276
- Getting her to a hospital.
- We still don't know how you did it.

403
00:40:07,351 --> 00:40:11,117
Speaking with Agent Doggett,
he said they never reached you
with specifiic coordinates.

404
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,851
There was a light.

405
00:40:14,926 --> 00:40:17,292
I followed it.

406
00:40:17,361 --> 00:40:19,295
Guess we got
our next headline.

407
00:40:33,111 --> 00:40:35,045
How's everybody doing?

408
00:40:40,218 --> 00:40:42,413
We're doing just fiine.

409
00:40:52,263 --> 00:40:54,254
- Hey, now.
- ( baby crying )

410
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,894
- None of that.
- ( baby gurgling )

411
00:41:08,112 --> 00:41:10,342
Hi.

412
00:41:15,219 --> 00:41:17,153
What are you
gonna call him?

413
00:41:17,188 --> 00:41:19,156
William.

414
00:41:21,392 --> 00:41:23,326
After your father.

415
00:41:30,268 --> 00:41:33,169
Well, I don't know.

416
00:41:33,204 --> 00:41:36,435
He's got your coloring
and your eyes...

417
00:41:36,507 --> 00:41:40,944
but he looks suspiciously
like Assistant Director Skinner.

418
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:53,287
I don't understand, Mulder.

419
00:41:56,093 --> 00:41:58,220
They came to take him
from us.

420
00:42:01,098 --> 00:42:03,225
Why they didn't--

421
00:42:06,103 --> 00:42:08,469
I don't quite understand
that either.

422
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:11,872
Except that maybe he isn't
what they thought he was.

423
00:42:14,612 --> 00:42:18,412
That doesn't make him any less
of a miracle though, does it?

424
00:42:23,621 --> 00:42:26,385
From the moment
I became pregnant...

425
00:42:26,457 --> 00:42:28,391
I feared the truth...

426
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:34,197
about how... and why.

427
00:42:36,567 --> 00:42:39,468
And I know
that you feared it too.

428
00:42:39,503 --> 00:42:41,994
I think what we feared
were the possibilities.

429
00:42:45,543 --> 00:42:48,376
The truth we both know.

430
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:52,415
Which is what?

431
00:43:52,076 --> 00:43:54,912
CHILD:
I made this!

432
00:43:54,912 --> 00:43:56,937
CHILD:
I made this!
