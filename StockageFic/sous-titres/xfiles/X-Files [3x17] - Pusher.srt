is a powerful force.

than inducing them to drive
in front of a speeding truck.

80
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,080

is the same. It’s just a lot
more powerful in this case.

I mean, this guy
calls himself Pusher.

82
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,560
Can't we take that to mean that he
pushes his will onto other people ?

Well, even if he could
push his will,

84
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,960
why would he cause an accident
when he himself was in the car ?

[Man] Rise and state your name
and address for the court.

179
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,920
Robert Patrick Modell,

180
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,120
3083 Roseneath Avenue,
apartment nine.

Alexandria, Virginia.

182
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,480
Agent Mulder, does the F.B.I.
believe that this defendant...

183
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,000
is responsible
for 1 4 murders ?

184
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,160
That is correct,
Your Honor.

185
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,320
Well, in each of the cases,
the coroner's office ruled suicide.

186
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,000
We believe that they
were indeed murders, Your Honor.

187
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,280
You believe ?

188
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,640
- But do you have any evidence ?
- We have the defendant on audiotape...

189
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,640
confessing to the murders
on several separate occasions--

190
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,640
he clearly identifies
them as such.

191
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,000
Furthermore, the defendant
knows crime scene details...

192
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,080
that were only available
to the police.

193
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,360
Your Honor, one of these
so-called murder victims threw
herself under a commuter train.

194
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,320
This was a crowded platform.
A hundred witnesses. Nobody pushed her.

195
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,560
No one was
within30 feet of her.

196
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,080
- But your client was present.
- Which is how he knew your
crime scene details.

197
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,960
- Make your point, Agent Mulder.
- I believe that these people died...

198
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,800
because it was the defendant's
express will that they do so.

199
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,360
- His will ?
- This man admitted to being
a killer for hire.

200
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,560
I believe he has a unique suggestive
ability which makes for the perfect M.O.

201
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,280
He is able to talk his victims
into injuring themselves.

202
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,320
- I can't believe this.
- Do you want to run that by me
one more time, Agent Mulder?

203
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,640
Yesterday a federal
law enforcement officer...

204
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,160
was induced to self-immolation
by the defendant.

205
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,360
I witnessed it.
All these other officers witnessed it.

206
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,680
Your Honor, we have Modell's confession.
All we're asking is--

207
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,520
Your Honor, the evidence chain
to this case has been rather
difficult to establish.

208
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,640
We're asking the court's indulgence
while we complete our investigation...

209
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,640
and we'd like to have Mr. Modell
held for trial...

210
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,640
based on the strength
of his taped confession.

211
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,920
What about this audiotape,
Mr. Modell ?

212
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,960
Did you confess
to 14murders ?

213
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,840
Unfortunately, yes, Your Honor.
Not that I remember any of it.

214
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,200
This was, uh, basically
a drunken phone prank...

215
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,280
on the part of my client,
Your Honor.

216
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,200
A phone prank ? He had the details
of every case, Your Honor.

217
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:23,760
And Robert deeply regrets the distress
and confusion this situation has caused.

218
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,280
Do you deny these charges ?

219
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,960
Absolutely, Your Honor.
I'm not guilty.

220
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,320
Excuse me for a minute.

221
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
I believe you owe me
five dollars.

Hey, your shoe's untied.

223

I made you look.

How do you do it ?

225
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,960
Hey, Modell.

226
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,080
I know your name now.

227
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,200
I know where you live.

228
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,800
I dug up a few more things
on our Robert Patrick Modell.

229
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,800
Let me guess.
He was an average student.

230
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,360
He attended
an average community college.
He did an average stint in the military.

231
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,480
- Which branch of service ?
- Not his first choice.

232
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,400
He wanted to be a Navy Seal
and then he wanted to be an Army
Special Forces, Green Beret.

233
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,280
Promptly washed out of both,
though not for lack of intelligence.

234
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,560
He ended up being
a supply clerk at Fort Bragg.

235
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,760
Served two years,
general discharge.

236
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Did you know that he applied
to the F.B.I. ?

237
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,840
- He didn't even come close
to passing the psych screening.
- You got a copy of that ?

238
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,360
Yeah. They found him to be
"acutely ego-centered."

239
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,360
He has no regard
for the feelings of others,

240
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,360
instead perceiving
people as objects.

241
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,760
He is extremely suspicious
of governments and authority.

242
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,960
Yet he wants
to be in authority.

243
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,440
The screener caught him in a dozen
self-aggrandizing lies.

244
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,440
Saying that he was a master
of martial arts,

245
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,000
that he had been trained by Gurk has
in Nepal and ninjas in Japan.

246
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,000
And ninjas are said to have the ability
to cloud the minds of their opponents.

247
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,600
Now, are we talking
kung fu movies, Mulder ?

248
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,680
He certainly clouded the mind
of that judge, Scully.

249
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,120
Even if Modell could, he didn't need to.
We barely had a case.

250
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,160
Oh, we had enough to get past
a simple preliminary hearing.

251
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,120
Modell psyched the guy out.
He put the "whammy" on him.

252
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,680
Please explain to me
the scientific nature of the "whammy."

253
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,280
I don't know. Maybe it's some mental
aspect of some Eastern martial art.

254
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,920
You know, the temporary suppression
of the brain's chemistry...

255
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,400
produced by a specific timbre
or cadence in Modell's voice.

256
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,400
His voice
seems to be the key.

257
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,400
Mulder, Modell's last known employment
was as a convenience store clerk.

258
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,600
He has never been trained by ninjas.
He has never even been out of the U.S.

259
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,440
He is just a little man who wishes
that he were someone big.

260
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,600
And we're feeding that wish.

261
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,480
That failed psych screening, if Modell
could actually control people's minds,

262
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,600
right now he'd be
an F.B.I. agent, right ?

263
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,120
He'd be a Green Beret,
a Navy Seal.

264
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,800
Maybe the ability came to him more
recently, like in the last two years.

265
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,440
Well, okay.
What's your big theory ?

is guilty of murder ?

an explanation a little more
mundane than the "whammy."

out of the building.

494
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,080
[Man On Radio]
We copy. We're ready for him.

495
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,080
Mulder, wait-- wait.

496
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,120
- Get closer to the computer monitor.
- Over here ?

497
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right there.

498
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,120
There. That light mass
in his temporal lobe.

499
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,200
Right here.

500
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,200
You were right, Mulder.

501
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,720
Now check around you. Modell's chart
should be somewhere around there.

502
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,880
We're batting a thousand, Scully.
Modell's dying.

503
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,920
He's got nothing to lose.

504
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,760
Mulder, just get
out of there. Go.

505
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,680
Mulder.

506
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,760
Mulder !

507
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,200
We think they're
three doors down.

508
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,200
We've got both ends
sewn up tight,

509
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,360
but there're six critical care rooms
we can't get to.

510
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,400
If we gas the halls,
we might kill those patients.

511
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,040
Why do we keep giving this guy
exactly what he wants ?

512
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,000
just wait for a signal from me.

513
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,560
You're clear.

514
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,720
Mulder.

515
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,440
Thanks for joining us.

516
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,760
We've got a dozen law enforcement
officers outside in the hall,

517
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,520
another 30 in the parking lot.

518
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,680
A regular convention.

519
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,840
So whatever you’ve got planned,
it's not going to work out
the way you want it to.

520
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,240
You don't know
what I got planned.

521
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,680
Two warriors of equal skill
fight to the death.

522
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,520
One is a student
of Japanese budo--

523
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,080
the way of war.

524
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,880
Budo teaches the warrior
to leave himself outside the battle.

525
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,040
In other words,

526
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,560
to disregard his own death.

527
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,000
Because of that,
the budo warrior always wins.

528
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,880
I am that warrior.

529
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,520
I don't fear my death.

530
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,320
So l--
I'm gonna give you...

531
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,840
one pull of the trigger
against me.

532
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,480
A one-in-six chance.

533
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,840
One. One pull.

534
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,640
Wait.

535
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,560
Mulder, look.
There's pure oxygen in this room.

536
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,240
There’s no telling what could happen
if you pull that trigger.

537
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,800
Piece of cake.

538
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,760
Your turn.

539
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,000
Mulder, no.

540
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,680
Mulder, yes.

541
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,280
- Go.
- Mulder, listen tome.

542
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,880
Give me the gun.

543
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,600
We can stop this thing
right now. You and I can just
walk outside of this room.

544
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,360
No ! Damn you !
You bastard !

545
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,120
Mulder,
hand me the gun--

546
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,400
Mulder, you don't
have to do this.

547
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,480
You're stronger than this.

548
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,840
Your turn, Scully. Gotta play by
the rules. Pull the trigger, Mulder.

549
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,160
Mulder, fight him.
You can fight this.

550
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,160
Come on.
Pull the trigger, Mulder.

551
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:31,400
She shot you. I read it in her files.
Payback time. Shoot the little spy!

552
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,640
- I'm gonna kill you, Modell.
- Yeah. Pull the trigger.
You get another crack at me.

553
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,480
Scully, run !

554
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,520
[ Whispering ]
Scully.

555
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,600
[ Alarm Ringing ]

556
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,120
Federal Agent. Get down !
Get down ! Get down !

557
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,600
There's no telling
how long he'll hang on,

558
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,440
but he'll never
regain consciousness.

559
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,240
You know how we thought he was
undergoing treatment ? We were wrong.

560
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,160
- What do you mean ?
- Read his chart.

561
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,200
The M.R.I.s were a way to gauge
how much life he had left,

562
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,200
but he consistently
refused treatment.

563
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,320
The tumor remained operable
right up until the end,
but he refused to have it removed.

564
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,880
- Why ?
- I think it's like you said,

565
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,400
he was always such
a little man.

566
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,280
This was finally something
that made him feel big.

567
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,320
I say we don't let him
take up another minute of our time.
