of victims.

- Anthropomancy.

you can see things about this crime.

he sees himself
as some kind of a...

Can you describe him ?
Do you get a visual impression of him ?

about her life ?

Be honest, Scully.
Doesn't that propane tank...

236
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:45,680
bear more than as light resemblance to
a little, fat white Nazi storm trooper?

00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:31,361
How should I know ?

334
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,127
I mean, are you seeing it in a vision
or is it a sensation ?

335
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,636
- How do you know where to go ?
- I just know.

336
00:22:38,704 --> 00:22:42,333
- But how do you know ?
- I don't know.

337
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:45,767
Look, it’s just up ahead.

338
00:22:47,546 --> 00:22:51,004
There are worse ways to go, but I can't
think of a more undignified one...

339
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:53,641
than autoerotic asphyxiation.

340
00:22:56,355 --> 00:22:58,346
Why are you
telling me that ?

341
00:22:58,424 --> 00:23:00,756
Look.
Forget I mentioned it.

342
00:23:00,826 --> 00:23:03,226
It's none of my business.

343
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,461
Oops. Pull over here.

344
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:08,466
Stop. Stop.

345
00:23:22,748 --> 00:23:24,807
This is the spot.

346
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:29,684
I guess you run into a lot
of dead bodies in your line of work.

347
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:32,155
You get used to it.

348
00:23:32,224 --> 00:23:36,422
I never have. I'm not
sure you’re supposed to.

349
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:39,692
Do you remember the first time
you foresaw someone's death ?

350
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:41,733
1 959.

351
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,361
- What happened in 1 959 ?
- Buddy Holly's plane crashed.

352
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:48,998
- You prognosticated
Buddy Holly's death ?
- Oh, God, no.

353
00:23:49,074 --> 00:23:51,008
Why would I want
to do that ?

354
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:54,068
But I did have a ticket
to see him perform the next night.

355
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:57,808
Actually, I was a bigger fan
of the Big Bopper than Buddy Holly.

356
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:00,908
"Chantilly Lace."
That was the song.

357
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:02,953
[ Mulder]
I'm not following you.

358
00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:09,684
The Big Bopper was not supposed to be
on the plane with Buddy Holly.

359
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:13,027
He won the seat from somebody else
by flipping a coin for it.

360
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:15,032
I'm still
not following.

361
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,399
Imagine all the things
that had to occur,

362
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,930
not only in his life
but in everybody else's,

363
00:24:23,008 --> 00:24:26,500
to arrange it so that
on that particular night...

364
00:24:26,612 --> 00:24:29,012
the Big Bopper
would be in a position...

365
00:24:29,081 --> 00:24:32,608
to live or die depending on
a flipping coin.

366
00:24:32,718 --> 00:24:36,882
I became so obsessed
with that idea...

367
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:39,480
that I gradually became
capable of seeing...

368
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:43,426
the specifics
of everybody’s death.

369
00:24:43,495 --> 00:24:45,929
I'm not one who readily believes
in that kind of thing.

370
00:24:45,998 --> 00:24:48,990
And if I was,
I still wouldn't believe that story.

371
00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:52,594
I know it sounds crazy,
but I swear it's true.

372
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:55,333
I was a bigger fan
of the Big Bopper than Buddy Holly.

373
00:24:57,743 --> 00:24:59,711
Where's the body ?

374
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:02,008
Mr. Bruckman, I don't understand
how you could know...

375
00:25:02,114 --> 00:25:05,572
that this is the exact area,
but you can't pinpoint the exact spot.

376
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:13,258
I guess I can't see
the forest for the trees.

377
00:25:17,863 --> 00:25:19,797
Okay, now.

378
00:25:27,506 --> 00:25:30,600
I'm glad I could bring a little smile
into your life, Mr. Bruckman.

379
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:32,871
I'm not smiling.
I'm wincing.

380
00:25:47,926 --> 00:25:49,860
What is this ?

381
00:25:49,928 --> 00:25:52,897
The only evidence recovered
from Claude Duckenfield's body.

382
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:56,264
That fiber may have come
from something the killer
was wearing at the time of the crime.

383
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:59,771
Don’t you have crime labs
that analyze these things for you ?

384
00:25:59,838 --> 00:26:01,772
Yes. Yes, we do.

385
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,967
But it will take them time
to provide any information.

386
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:06,340
A similar fiber was found on one
of the earlier victims,

387
00:26:06,445 --> 00:26:08,504
and we're still waiting
for the lab to determine its source.

388
00:26:08,614 --> 00:26:11,174
You'd be saving us
a great deal of work.

389
00:26:11,283 --> 00:26:14,252
Look, I've got
my own work to do.

390
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:16,844
I'm not a crime fighter
by trade.

391
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:23,861
Mr. Bruckman,

392
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:27,456
I can't speak for my partner,
but I'm desperate...

393
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:29,466
for some insurance.

394
00:26:31,003 --> 00:26:34,166
General Mutual has some
very comprehensive coverage--

395
00:26:47,352 --> 00:26:49,286
No.

396
00:26:49,354 --> 00:26:53,313
I can't tell you where
this is from, but-but...

397
00:26:53,392 --> 00:26:56,190
the killer's gonna kill more people
before you catch him.

398
00:26:56,261 --> 00:26:59,094
Can you see him
physically yet ?

399
00:26:59,164 --> 00:27:03,100
No, just more insight into
his character, which I know you hate.

400
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,671
- He thinks he's psychic.
- Is he ?

401
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:11,843
I hope not. I've seen
some of the things he's seen.

402
00:27:11,977 --> 00:27:14,036
What does he see ?

403
00:27:14,112 --> 00:27:16,910
- Hey !
- You.

404
00:27:18,684 --> 00:27:22,085
He sees you...
trying to catch him.

405
00:27:23,188 --> 00:27:26,123
Where does this
take place ?

406
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:28,284
In a kitchen.

407
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,420
You're looking around
for someone.

408
00:27:31,496 --> 00:27:33,862
He's behind you now,
but you don't know it.

409
00:27:33,966 --> 00:27:36,628
He’s stalking
towards you and--

410
00:27:36,735 --> 00:27:39,260
- Oh, God.
- What? What do you see ?

411
00:27:39,371 --> 00:27:41,999
He's got a knife.
It's got blood on it.

412
00:27:42,074 --> 00:27:45,407
- What am I doing ?
- You're looking down.

413
00:27:45,477 --> 00:27:48,913
You've stepped in a pie
that's fallen to the floor.

414
00:27:48,981 --> 00:27:50,915
The killer comes
up to you and--

415
00:27:51,984 --> 00:27:54,316
- Coconut cream.
- What ?

416
00:27:54,386 --> 00:27:56,820
The pie.
Coconut cream.

417
00:27:56,888 --> 00:27:59,618
Or is it lemon meringue ?
I don't know.

418
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:02,489
- I'm not sure. It's hazy.
- Whatever. Please continue.

419
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:06,630
As you're looking down,

420
00:28:06,732 --> 00:28:09,200
he comes up with the knife and--
Banana cream !

421
00:28:09,267 --> 00:28:10,825
Definitely
banana cream.

422
00:28:10,936 --> 00:28:14,770
All right. I'm looking down at this
banana cream pie, and then what ?

423
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:20,778
He sees himself
coming up to you from behind--

424
00:28:22,547 --> 00:28:24,811
And ? And what does he see ?

425
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:31,655
Nothing.

426
00:28:31,723 --> 00:28:33,987
The visions of a madman.

427
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:39,829
You got all that from this ?

428
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:43,332
How am I supposed to get anything
from this tiny, little thing ?

429
00:28:43,402 --> 00:28:45,336
This came
in the mail today.

430
00:28:46,872 --> 00:28:48,237
Who's it from ?

431
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:52,843
The killer.

432
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,221
"To whom it may concern:
This is a mere formality...

433
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,589
to let you know
I know that you know.

434
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,560
Can't wait till
our first meeting
when I kill you.

435
00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:13,325
But not before you explain
some things tome.

436
00:29:13,432 --> 00:29:15,866
First on the list:
Why in the world did
I send you this letter ?

437
00:29:15,934 --> 00:29:18,061
Sincerely,
you know who.

438
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:21,867
- P.S. Say hi to the F.B.I. agents."
- Hi.

439
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,103
He must have been at the crime scene
seeing you with us.

440
00:29:25,177 --> 00:29:29,443
No, this letter is postmarked
the day before Mr. Bruckman
joined our investigation.

441
00:29:29,514 --> 00:29:32,005
You're gonna have to come with us.
We've gotta get you out of here.

442
00:29:32,084 --> 00:29:34,075
Look.

443
00:29:34,152 --> 00:29:37,087
I'll be dead before you catch this guy
no matter what you do.

444
00:29:39,858 --> 00:29:42,850
You've come to me
because you’re searching for someone.

445
00:29:42,928 --> 00:29:46,159
But don't worry.
This person will find you.

446
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:49,496
It's a relative
or a close friend.

447
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:51,569
Actually,
a guy I'm gonna kill.

448
00:29:56,341 --> 00:29:58,275
Ah, yes.
It's clearer now.

449
00:29:58,343 --> 00:30:00,971
You seek answers
from a special man...

450
00:30:01,046 --> 00:30:03,879
who possesses
a special wisdom.

451
00:30:03,949 --> 00:30:06,543
This is real cream.

452
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:10,145
Not the phony stuff.
I know the difference.

453
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:13,487
And the chocolate--
very rich.

454
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:16,083
Look at these cute little
doilies they put everything on.

455
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:18,652
You sure you
don't want to join me ?

456
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:25,135
What are you doing ?

457
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:27,797
Studying
background checks.

458
00:30:27,906 --> 00:30:30,374
This is what detective work
is really like.

459
00:30:30,475 --> 00:30:33,638
We can't come up with suspects
by having visions.

460
00:30:33,712 --> 00:30:35,771
jealous ?

461
00:30:35,847 --> 00:30:38,509
You're very confused
right now.

462
00:30:39,618 --> 00:30:42,451
Nothing seems
to make sense to you.

463
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,584
You don't know why you do
the things that you do.

464
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:53,325
But your confusion is soon to come to an
abrupt end with the arrival of a woman.

465
00:30:54,332 --> 00:30:56,300
A blonde or a brunette.

466
00:30:56,368 --> 00:30:58,598
Maybe a redhead.

467
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,468
There's something
you haven't explained.

468
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:05,943
- Can you see your own end ?
- I see our end.

469
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,271
We end up in bed together.

470
00:31:11,716 --> 00:31:13,911
I'm sorry.

471
00:31:13,985 --> 00:31:16,886
I shouldn't have said that.
I don't mean to offend or scare you.

472
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:20,857
But not here.
Not this bed.

473
00:31:23,061 --> 00:31:26,519
I just mean,
I see us quite clearly...

474
00:31:26,598 --> 00:31:29,066
in bed together.

475
00:31:29,134 --> 00:31:31,068
You're holding my hand...

476
00:31:32,904 --> 00:31:35,134
very tenderly,
and then...

477
00:31:35,207 --> 00:31:38,142
you're looking at me
with such compassion.

478
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,872
And I feel--

479
00:31:40,946 --> 00:31:44,109
Tears are streaming
down my face.

480
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,984
I feel so grateful.

481
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:54,754
It’s just a very special moment
neither of us will ever forget.

482
00:31:57,229 --> 00:31:59,163
Mr. Bruckman,

483
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:02,291
there are hits
and there are misses.

484
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,630
And then there are misses.

485
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:09,598
I just call 'em as I see 'em.

486
00:32:12,744 --> 00:32:15,212
Wow. I'm really impressed.

487
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,374
I've been to a lot of fortune-tellers,
but by far you’re the best.

488
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:21,442
There's still
one more card left.

489
00:32:23,922 --> 00:32:28,052
This card's not meant for me.
It's yours.

490
00:32:33,698 --> 00:32:35,825
So Ahab
mistakes the prophecy...

491
00:32:35,934 --> 00:32:37,902
and, as a result, dies.

492
00:32:38,003 --> 00:32:40,233
A similar fate
happens to Macbeth.

493
00:32:40,305 --> 00:32:42,432
Still, you're not
the least bit curious ?

494
00:32:42,507 --> 00:32:46,876
- [ Knocking At Door]
- That must be Mulder.

495
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:49,072
Time for the midnight shift.

496
00:33:01,493 --> 00:33:04,462
All right.
So how do I die ?

497
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:08,232
You don't.

498
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:12,998
[Knocking]

499
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,601
Get this, Scully. The lab analysis
from the first bit of fiber...

500
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,910
that was found--
It's lace.

501
00:33:23,982 --> 00:33:27,315
- Chantilly lace ?
- You know what I like.

502
00:33:27,385 --> 00:33:31,481
It's not likely the killer was wearing
anything made out of Chantilly lace...

503
00:33:31,556 --> 00:33:34,650
- at the time of the murders.
- What are the odds of the
Big Bopper, Chantilly lace--

504
00:33:34,726 --> 00:33:36,421
It's a coincidence.

505
00:33:36,494 --> 00:33:40,487
If coincidences are just coincidences,
why do they feel so contrived ?

506
00:33:40,598 --> 00:33:43,465
That's one to pose
to the psychic philosopher.

507
00:33:43,535 --> 00:33:45,526
Good night, Mulder.

508
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:53,304
Am I keeping you awake ?

509
00:33:53,378 --> 00:33:56,939
I'm waiting for you to ask me another
of those "psychic ability" questions.

510
00:33:58,483 --> 00:34:01,213
I've had dreams in my life
where I had a vision...

511
00:34:01,286 --> 00:34:04,449
and then later on, I've seen
that vision in reality.

512
00:34:04,522 --> 00:34:08,822
As a psychic, have you ever had
prophetic dreams like that ?

513
00:34:08,893 --> 00:34:11,794
I have only one dream.

514
00:34:11,863 --> 00:34:14,491
I dream it every night.

515
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:17,591
You're not one of those people who
turns everything into a sexual symbol ?

516
00:34:17,702 --> 00:34:20,330
No, I'm not
a Freudian. No.

517
00:34:20,438 --> 00:34:23,407
I'm lying naked...

518
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:26,069
in a field of red tulips.

519
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:31,875
I'm not concerned
with where lam or how I got there.

520
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:37,149
I'm at peace. And it’s then
that I realize I'm dead.

521
00:34:37,222 --> 00:34:41,886
My body begins to turn
a greenish white with spots of purple.

522
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,428
Next, the insects arrive.

523
00:34:44,496 --> 00:34:48,660
The inevitable follows--
putridity and liquescence.

524
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:52,066
Before I know it,
I'm nothing but bones.

525
00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:55,402
When I start fading to dust, I lose
whatever care I still might've had...

526
00:34:55,473 --> 00:34:57,441
about where my clothes are.

527
00:34:57,542 --> 00:35:01,239
And as I begin to feel myself
slipping away towards l-know-not-what,

528
00:35:01,312 --> 00:35:03,405
I wake up.

529
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:05,506
Well, good night.

530
00:35:07,385 --> 00:35:10,718
-[Knocking At Door]
-[Scully] Mulder, there's--

531
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:13,781
- Are you okay ?
- Oh, yeah. I just didn't sleep well.

532
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:15,792
What's up ?

533
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,760
Havez is going
to stay with Bruckman...

534
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:20,525
while we go over to a tarot card reader
around the corner.

535
00:35:20,632 --> 00:35:22,497
There's been
another murder.

536
00:35:22,634 --> 00:35:24,898
I'm beginning to lose patience
with our psychic, Scully.

537
00:35:24,969 --> 00:35:27,437
What good are his prophecies
if they’re not preventive ?

538
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:30,303
Actually, I'm starting to feel
more sympathetic towards him.

539
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:33,936
- You're convinced he's a psychic now ?
- No, not really.

540
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:35,570
Sorry, ma'am.

541
00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:39,105
But I am convinced that,
by thinking he can see the future,

542
00:35:39,184 --> 00:35:41,118
he's taken all the joy
out of his life.

543
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:44,747
[Man]
So then, the priest says to the rabbi--

544
00:35:44,823 --> 00:35:46,791
I had it set for quail.

545
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:49,224
Yeah !

546
00:35:49,294 --> 00:35:53,628
- Hey. I thought you said you
hadn't heard that one before.
- I hadn't.

547
00:35:57,602 --> 00:36:02,005
Hey. Is it true that you can
see how people are gonna die ?

548
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:05,236
I mean, can you...

549
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,801
see how I'm going to die ?

550
00:36:11,182 --> 00:36:13,116
Lung cancer ?

551
00:36:17,188 --> 00:36:19,122
[ Exhales ]
Thank God.

552
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:30,667
[Coughs]

553
00:36:30,735 --> 00:36:34,296
I got to go visit
your restroom for a second.

554
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,607
Don't open that door
for anybody.

555
00:36:42,313 --> 00:36:45,282
- Oh, God !
- [ Knocking At Door]

556
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,805
Was that not enough
of a tip ?

557
00:37:41,873 --> 00:37:45,206
They brought you right to me,
right to where I work.

558
00:37:45,276 --> 00:37:47,437
What are the chances
of that happening ?

559
00:37:47,512 --> 00:37:51,175
They're astronomical.
It's beyond believability.

560
00:37:51,249 --> 00:37:55,447
But not impossibility.
I mean, after all, here we are.

561
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,353
It's funny how things
work out sometimes, isn't it ?

562
00:37:58,423 --> 00:38:00,755
I'll say.

563
00:38:03,328 --> 00:38:06,229
There's something I've wanted
to ask you for some time now.

564
00:38:06,297 --> 00:38:09,460
You've seen the things I do in the past
as well as in the future.

565
00:38:09,534 --> 00:38:11,468
They're terrible things.

566
00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:15,870
I know they are. So tell me, please.
Why have I done them ?

567
00:38:17,008 --> 00:38:19,306
Don’t you
understand yet, son ?

568
00:38:19,377 --> 00:38:21,368
Don’t you get it ?

569
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:29,713
You do the things you do
because you’re a homicidal maniac.

570
00:38:33,057 --> 00:38:35,525
That--

571
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:37,891
That does explain a lot,
doesn't it ?

572
00:38:39,931 --> 00:38:41,865
It's all starting
to make sense now.

573
00:38:46,738 --> 00:38:50,071
No. You don't kill me now.

574
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:54,441
- I don't ? Why not ?
- How should I know ?

575
00:38:54,512 --> 00:38:56,707
[Door Opens]

576
00:39:00,284 --> 00:39:03,185
[Grunting]

577
00:39:05,156 --> 00:39:09,525
Either we got a copycat killer, or our
guy's getting extremely lackadaisical.

578
00:39:09,594 --> 00:39:12,392
Not only did he leave the body, but he
didn't even bother to remove the eyes.

579
00:39:19,837 --> 00:39:25,207
If my Miss Manners serves me right,
that protrusion from his left cornea
is a salad fork.

580
00:39:25,276 --> 00:39:27,801
Something tells me
we're gonna get prints off it.

581
00:39:32,316 --> 00:39:35,080
Mulder, I found another
strand of that silk.

582
00:39:35,153 --> 00:39:37,348
We got more than that
this time, Scully.

583
00:39:37,422 --> 00:39:39,856
We got fingerprints.
Probably a footprint, even.

584
00:39:39,957 --> 00:39:42,926
This is more like it. No more psychics
and their vague predictions.

585
00:39:42,994 --> 00:39:45,326
Hell, we don't even need
our own hunches.

586
00:39:45,396 --> 00:39:48,126
This case is just now about good
old-fashioned forensic police work.

587
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:50,326
It's the bellhop.

588
00:39:50,401 --> 00:39:53,370
He's the killer.
The bellhop at the hotel.

589
00:39:55,773 --> 00:39:58,139
How the hell
does she know that?

590
00:39:58,209 --> 00:40:00,143
Woman's intuition.

591
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:16,059
Havez ?

592
00:40:17,428 --> 00:40:19,362
Mr. Bruckman ?

593
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,047
Hey !

594
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:35,398
Drop it!

595
00:41:35,473 --> 00:41:37,407
- [ Gunshot ]
- [ Grunts ]

596
00:41:42,013 --> 00:41:45,710
Hey. That's not the way
it's supposed to happen.

597
00:41:52,256 --> 00:41:54,850
- How did you know where to find us ?
- I didn't.

598
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:57,757
I got on the service elevator
by mistake.

599
00:41:57,829 --> 00:41:59,888
Thank heaven
for happenstance.

600
00:41:59,997 --> 00:42:02,898
None of Bruckman's
prophecy came true.

601
00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:06,232
The killer didn't get to him first,
but he did kill Havez.

602
00:42:06,304 --> 00:42:08,568
Then Bruckman's
all right ?

603
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:10,937
Actually, I don't know.
I couldn't find him.

604
00:42:11,008 --> 00:42:13,067
Then where is he ?

605
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:22,085
" Miss Scully.

606
00:42:28,392 --> 00:42:30,519
My neighbor, Mrs. Lowe,
passed away last night.

607
00:42:30,628 --> 00:42:33,927
Please see that the remains
of her remains are
taken care of.

608
00:42:33,998 --> 00:42:36,990
Would you like a dog?
He is paper trained
and well behaved,

609
00:42:37,068 --> 00:42:40,868
regardless of his actions last night
which you can't really blame him for."

610
00:43:22,113 --> 00:43:25,082
[Man] Well, here’s another
nice mess you've gotten me into.

611
00:43:25,216 --> 00:43:27,116
Well, I couldn't help it.

612
00:43:27,184 --> 00:43:30,347
Come on. Let's get back
to Peoria, where we belong.

613
00:43:45,202 --> 00:43:47,295
Do you want to know
the future ?

614
00:43:47,371 --> 00:43:49,362
[Yappi]
Do you want to know what lies ahead?

615
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,409
Then call me,
the Stupendous Yappi.

616
00:43:52,476 --> 00:43:56,640
For years, I have entertained audiences
with my psychic abilities.

617
00:43:56,747 --> 00:44:00,012
I have been consulted
by Hollywood stars,

618
00:44:00,117 --> 00:44:02,517
police departments,
even presidents.

619
00:44:02,586 --> 00:44:06,352
Now I can be your
personal psychic consultant.

620
00:44:06,424 --> 00:44:09,018
Do you want to know
if you will get that promotion ?

621
00:44:09,093 --> 00:44:12,961
Do you want to know
if your marriage will be successful ?

622
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:15,863
Do you want to know where you
will meet your one truelove ?

623
00:44:15,933 --> 00:44:19,266
Then call me
at 1 -900-555-YAPP.

624
00:44:19,337 --> 00:44:23,034
Remember, the future's close at hand,
and so is your phone.

625
00:44:23,107 --> 00:44:26,543
So to hear tomorrow's secrets today,
just pick it up.

626
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,544
I know you will.

627
00:44:28,612 --> 00:44:31,740
- I can see your future.

628
00:45:10,521 --> 00:45:12,318

I made this.
