1
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,481
Good afternoon.
I hope we're not bothering you.

2
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,847
- Actually, I'm just...
- We really won't take up
much of your time.

3
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,546
- I'm just waiting for a call.
- We're all waiting, ma'am,

4
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,589
for the good Lord
to call in his flock.

5
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:59,386
From the cable TV people.

6
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,791
I'm just moving in.
God bless.

7
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,590
Good afternoon.
I hope we're not bothering...

8
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,966
- Yes?
- Y-You're...

9
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,971
- Weren't you...
- Yeah, didn't we just...

10
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,701
- Didn't you just what?
- Speak to you.

11
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:53,144
- Excuse me?
- We just spoke to a woman
who... could've been your twin.

12
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,147
- What are you talking about?

13
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:58,582
Yeah, just down the street. She's
just moving in. Your spitting image.

14
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,381
You're really not gonna believe it
when you see her.

15
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:08,321
- Ma'am?
- Go away! Get out of here!

16
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,495
Okay.

17
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:14,618
Betty Templeton?

18
00:04:14,686 --> 00:04:16,745
- Yes?
- We're with the F.B.I.

19
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:20,519
We'd like to ask about an
incident... a possible religious
hate crime in your neighborhood.

20
00:04:20,592 --> 00:04:23,755
I just moved in yesterday. I don't
know anything about any incident.

21
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:28,198
Well, we have two young men in the car
who say you do know something.

22
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:30,360
Oh, my God!

23
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:34,269
Those were the boys that were
here yesterday. What happened?

24
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:37,001
They were beaten to within
an inch of their lives by each other...

25
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:40,476
after visiting the home
of a woman living a few blocks over.

26
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,538
- What woman?
- A woman who, by both
young men's accounts,

27
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:46,311
fits your description.

28
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:50,116
She, uh,
lives around here?

29
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:57,454
Are you a practitioner
of the occult, Miss Templeton?

30
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:01,898
Wicca, voodoo, Satanism,
the black art of bodily bilocation?

31
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:04,492
Me?
No.

32
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,504
You know what they say.

33
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,506
Everyone has a twin
out there somewhere.

34
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,339
No, we don't know
what they say.

35
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:16,006
Well, if there's someone who
fits my description, why isn't
someone talking to her?

36
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:19,175
We went over to the house,
but it's empty. No one lives there.

37
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:21,344
Frankly, we're not even sure
if she exists.

38
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:35,526
This is an F.B.I. fleet sedan...

39
00:06:35,594 --> 00:06:39,496
from our Kansas City
field office, requisitioned
by two seasoned agents there,

40
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:42,590
driven into a tree at 43 miles an hour
by the female agent...

41
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,466
in a novel effort
to kill her male counterpart.

42
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:51,565
Now, you might think I'm gonna
suggest psychokinesis, P. K...

43
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:56,706
someone or something controlling the
agents with remote mind-bending power.

44
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:59,683
But it's not?

45
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:04,347
Both agents sustained critical injuries.
Their stories eerily similar,

46
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:08,621
as if they temporarily
lost control of their minds,
unable to alter their behavior.

47
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:14,692
You may think that I'm gonna say
it's past lives unresolved,

48
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:17,735
a fate stalking the agents
like an animal.

49
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:22,066
- But you're not?
- No, the interesting thing
about these agents...

50
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,234
is that they had worked together
for seven years previously
without any incident.

51
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,746
- Seven years?
- Yeah, but they are not...

52
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:31,180
romantically involved,
if that's what you're thinking.

53
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:33,683
Not even I would be
so farfetched.

54
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:40,753
You have any ideas, Scully?
Any thoughts?

55
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:44,853
What I'm thinking, Mulder,
is how familiar this seems.

56
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,898
Playing Watson
to your Sherlock.

57
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:50,401
You dangling clues out
in front of me one by one.

58
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:53,495
It's a game, and...

59
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:56,040
And as usual, you're holding
something back from me.

60
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,009
You're not telling me
something about this case.

61
00:07:59,077 --> 00:08:01,341
Hmm?

62
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:05,406
Okay, so these agents
were investigating something.

63
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:09,250
- Something much like...

64
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:13,257
what they themselves
were almost killed by.

65
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:15,384
Uh, something they
came into contact with.

66
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,226
Uh, third party.

67
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:21,891
Two third parties.

68
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:24,299
Twins?

69
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:26,200
Relatives?

70
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:28,831
Uh, doppelganger?

71
00:08:30,308 --> 00:08:32,606
Uh, corporeal likeness...

72
00:08:32,677 --> 00:08:35,202
that appears unbidden
from the spirit world,

73
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,078
the sight of which
presages one's own death.

74
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:43,782
Or... a double conjured into the world
by a technique called bilocation,

75
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:46,722
which,
in psychological terms,

76
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:51,661
represents the person's
secret desires and impulses,

77
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,895
committing acts that a real person
cannot commit himself...

78
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:58,959
or... herself.

79
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:03,136
Mulder, the slide, please.

80
00:09:04,676 --> 00:09:07,008
Yes!

81
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:09,979
Don't go thinking I'm gonna
start doing the autopsies.

82
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:48,545
Excuse me.

83
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,986
Hi. I applied for
the sales job you posted.

84
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:55,288
Ah, yeah. I remember.
How could I forget?

85
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,227
- Excuse me?
- Uh, there's a problem
with your application,

86
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:00,730
- As I recall, Miss...
- Pfeiffer.

87
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,235
- Are you sure?
- Lulu Pfeiffer, yes.

88
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:07,203
You reside at
15527 Morton Bay Street?

89
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:10,537
- Not any longer. I've moved.
- You've moved?

90
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:12,839
Yes. And I don't have
my new address yet.

91
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:15,744
Actually, Miss Pfeiffer,
that's what's sending up the red flag.

92
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:19,375
You move a lot. And there's also
your employment history.

93
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:23,080
Seventeen jobs in seventeen states
in the past three years?

94
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:25,850
You seem to have as many jobs here
as you have addresses.

95
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:27,983
I... I had
a restless streak.

96
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:30,755
Well, the copy business
takes a motivated person.

97
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:35,095
Oh, I'm an extremely versatile employee,
as you can see by my resumé.

98
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:38,260
What I can tell is you've
left a variety of jobs.

99
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:41,737
"Mongolian barbecue chef,
high-rise window washer,

100
00:10:41,806 --> 00:10:44,775
- Wild animal trainer, palm reader."

101
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:47,577
- Yes, but I am on a career path now.
- Hey! What's going on here?

102
00:10:47,577 --> 00:10:48,908
- Yes, but I am on a career path now.
- Hey! What's going on here?

103
00:10:48,978 --> 00:10:52,345
- All my copies are black.
- My machine's going crazy.

104
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:54,406
Who's running
this place?

105
00:10:54,483 --> 00:10:57,850
I can start you immediately. There's a
clean uniform in the employee washroom.

106
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,754
- Oh, God.
- Here. Over here. Oh, that's great.

107
00:11:01,824 --> 00:11:04,691
- Can you help me turn this thing off?

108
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,194
My only copy!

109
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:25,380
That's quite a string of positions
you've had, Miss... Templeton.

110
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:28,008
Seventeen jobs
in the last three years.

111
00:11:28,084 --> 00:11:31,383
I would've listed more, but there
wasn't any room left on your form.

112
00:11:31,454 --> 00:11:33,445
Seventeen's plenty,
believe me.

113
00:11:33,522 --> 00:11:37,185
I think you'll find my former
employees will only give the
highest personal references...

114
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:41,161
It's not your references.
It's the jobs themselves.

115
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,633
"Mongolian barbecue chef,
high-rise window washer.

116
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:47,635
Wild animal trainer?"

117
00:11:47,703 --> 00:11:49,796
I'm a highly versatile employee.

118
00:11:52,008 --> 00:11:55,409
What guarantee do I have that you
won't just up and quit tomorrow?

119
00:11:55,478 --> 00:11:59,244
You have my personal word on it.
I'm here in Kansas City to stay.

120
00:12:23,506 --> 00:12:25,906
- Who is it?

121
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:28,739
Mr. Zupanic, it's the F.B.I.

122
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:31,575
- Excuse me?
- It's the F.B.I., Mr. Zupanic.

123
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:34,138
- Open up.
- Give me a minute.

124
00:12:39,255 --> 00:12:41,655
- Bert Zupanic?
- Yeah?

125
00:12:41,724 --> 00:12:43,817
We're hoping you could help us
find the whereabouts...

126
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:45,827
of a woman we think
you're familiar with...

127
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:48,489
a Betty Templeton.

128
00:12:48,564 --> 00:12:50,691
I don't know
no Betty Templeton.

129
00:12:50,766 --> 00:12:54,202
Maybe you should take another look
at that photograph, Mr. Zupanic.

130
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:57,535
Five foot three,
red hair.

131
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,642
Maybe I can
jog your memory.

132
00:13:06,749 --> 00:13:09,650
Are you still pleading
ignorance, Mr. Zupanic?

133
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:13,246
Is that not you in last year's
Fourth ofJuly parade?

134
00:13:13,322 --> 00:13:15,984
- Yeah.
- Then who's that sitting next to you?

135
00:13:16,058 --> 00:13:18,891
- Her.
- Try Betty Templeton.

136
00:13:20,596 --> 00:13:24,225
We can't find her, Mr. Zupanic.
She seems to have left town in a hurry.

137
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,495
- She did?
- Mm-hmm.

138
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:31,438
And didn't she used to live
on Morton Bay in a pink house?

139
00:13:32,975 --> 00:13:36,877
- Alderwood, blue house.
- On Alderwood?

140
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:40,040
Mr. Zupanic, do you have
any reason to be lying to us?

141
00:13:40,116 --> 00:13:42,175
No, sir...
I mean, ma'am.

142
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:45,880
Thank you, Mr. Zupanic. I have no doubt
we'll be in touch with you.

143
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:53,817
- You know what I'm thinking.
- That Mr. Zupanic not only
knows Betty Templeton...

144
00:13:53,896 --> 00:13:57,764
and where we can find her, but that
he is hip to whatever she's into,

145
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,199
and I should take a look at that house
he mentioned on Morton Bay Street...

146
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:03,500
while you go and find out
from Mr. Zupanic what it is exactly...

147
00:14:03,572 --> 00:14:05,802
that he's clearly hiding
about Betty Templeton.

148
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:10,039
I'm thinking that Bert Zupanic really
truly doesn't know Betty Templeton.

149
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:17,579
Well, I guess that's why
they put the "l" in the F.B.I.

150
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:03,125
I'm gonna be standin'on the corner

151
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,134
12th Street and Vine

152
00:15:08,871 --> 00:15:12,238
I'm gonna be standin'
on the corner

153
00:15:12,308 --> 00:15:14,333
12th Street and Vine

154
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,514
Give me a double,
Freddy.

155
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:22,676
I thought you were in training,
Bert, my man.

156
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:25,481
- Would you just pour?
- All right.

157
00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:28,352
Well, I might take a train

158
00:15:28,424 --> 00:15:32,292
I might take a plane
but if I have to walk

159
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:34,295
I'm goin'just the same

160
00:15:34,363 --> 00:15:36,888
I'm goin'to Kansas City

161
00:15:36,966 --> 00:15:39,434
Kansas City, here I come

162
00:15:40,636 --> 00:15:42,570
Nice outfit.

163
00:15:44,473 --> 00:15:47,874
Freddy,
fire in the hole.

164
00:15:47,943 --> 00:15:50,912
Seven and Seven for the lady,
and make it stiff.

165
00:15:52,014 --> 00:15:55,313
Oh, my God!
How did you do that?

166
00:15:55,384 --> 00:15:59,548
- Do what?
- How did you know my drink?

167
00:16:03,993 --> 00:16:06,860
I feel like you're looking
right through me,

168
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:10,057
like you're reading
my soul like a book.

169
00:16:12,301 --> 00:16:15,361
Maybe you've had enough
of the vodka.

170
00:16:15,437 --> 00:16:19,703
- You are in trouble, aren't you?
- I don't know.

171
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:22,005
I could be.

172
00:16:22,077 --> 00:16:24,011
What kind of trouble
are you looking for?

173
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,775
You don't want to go home
tonight, okay?

174
00:16:26,849 --> 00:16:29,875
It just so happens
I don't got a home to go to.

175
00:16:31,353 --> 00:16:36,347
Anyway, I'm Betty Templeton.

176
00:16:37,993 --> 00:16:39,927
Alderwood Avenue.

177
00:16:41,363 --> 00:16:44,093
- My God.

178
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,100
I'm shaking.

179
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,738
Oh... Oh, that's perfect.

180
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,214
Hey.

181
00:17:42,555 --> 00:17:44,489
Hey, Scully!

182
00:17:51,564 --> 00:17:55,591
I want you to meet a buddy of mine,
Mr. Argyle "Sapersteen."

183
00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:59,001
- "Stein."
- Saperstein. Excuse me.

184
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:01,972
- This is my partner, Dana Scully.

185
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,407
Pleasure and an honor.

186
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:08,971
So, uh, I take it from your posture,
Mulder, you've solved this case.

187
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:11,812
Not solved it, but I have narrowed
down the search for our perpetrator...

188
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,818
with the kind help
of Mr. Saperstein here.

189
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:17,287
- Narrowed it down to where?
- Right down there.

190
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,560
Our mystery woman is indeed
involved with Mr. Bert Zupanic,

191
00:18:22,628 --> 00:18:24,562
the man we spoke to
at his hotel,

192
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,930
who will be fighting here
two days hence with the mystery
woman undoubtedly in attendance.

193
00:18:29,001 --> 00:18:31,561
If it's the lady I'm thinking,
she's not much to look at,

194
00:18:31,637 --> 00:18:33,571
but he says
she brings him luck.

195
00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:37,336
- Bert Zupanic is a boxer?
- A wrestler, semipro.

196
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:42,347
So, we wait around Kansas City
for a couple of days until
we can talk to this woman?

197
00:18:42,415 --> 00:18:45,316
Well, there's lots to do here
and the barbecue's second to none.

198
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:48,148
Right, Mr. Saperstein? Plus,
Mr. Saperstein was gonna show me...

199
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,213
some in-your-face smack down
moves so I can quit getting
my ass kicked so often, right?

200
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:57,319
Oh, and there's... there's
an art exhibit that traces
the influence of Soviet art...

201
00:18:57,396 --> 00:19:00,763
on the American
pop culture, right?

202
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:04,030
Unless, of course,
you've already found Betty Templeton.

203
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:06,765
Finding Betty Templeton
won't solve this case, Mulder.

204
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,932
Not unless
we find Lulu Pfeiffer.

205
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:11,738
- Who's Lulu Pfeiffer?
- Our doppelganger...

206
00:19:11,811 --> 00:19:16,145
who lived, until yesterday,
in a pink house on Morton Bay Street.

207
00:19:16,215 --> 00:19:18,877
But she's not a manifestation,
Mulder. She's real...

208
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:21,886
and so is the path of destruction
that she's left in her wake.

209
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:24,923
Though there seems to be no connection
of any kind between these two women,

210
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,924
Betty Templeton
and Lulu Pfeiffer...

211
00:19:26,992 --> 00:19:30,553
have traveled city to city
across 17 U.S. states,

212
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:34,497
one alternately trailing
the other for the past 12 years.

213
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:39,266
- And wherever they have been,
mayhem has followed.
- Damn.

214
00:19:39,338 --> 00:19:42,865
It's not just car accidents
and fistfights, Mulder.

215
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:48,209
- It's house fires
and explosions and even riots.
- The lady knows her stuff.

216
00:19:51,016 --> 00:19:54,315
- Sholom Aleichem.
- Yeah. Your mama.

217
00:20:11,504 --> 00:20:13,802
- Hello.
- Where's my money?

218
00:20:13,873 --> 00:20:16,000
I got it,
and I'm bringing it.

219
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:19,806
Yeah, that's what I heard last night.
Now you got the feds on your ass.

220
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:23,838
- What?
- Your good luck charm
don't sound so lucky no more.

221
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,907
Maybe I should cancel
the fight.

222
00:20:25,985 --> 00:20:28,681
I'm bringing the money, okay?
I'm bringing it!

223
00:20:28,754 --> 00:20:33,623
I'm having lunch at Froggy's.
No money, no fight, Titanic.

224
00:20:36,462 --> 00:20:41,058
- In trouble or something?
- I'm just, uh...

225
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:43,067
I gotta be somewhere,
okay?

226
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:46,298
Why? What time is it?
Oh, God, I'm gonna be late for work!

227
00:20:51,644 --> 00:20:54,374
You were incredible.

228
00:20:54,446 --> 00:20:58,576
Why do I find myself so wildly attracted
to you, Bert Zupanic?

229
00:21:01,554 --> 00:21:03,988
You just can't
help yourself, baby.

230
00:21:20,272 --> 00:21:22,502
Where were you last night?

231
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:25,800
- Where was I?
- Yeah.

232
00:21:25,878 --> 00:21:28,676
- Well, I...
- You said, "Meet me for a drink."

233
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,681
- That's what you said.

234
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:32,979
I was there,
and I-I was waiting on you.

235
00:21:33,052 --> 00:21:37,580
- Are you two-timing me, Bert?
- How can you say that?
You're my good luck charm.

236
00:21:37,656 --> 00:21:41,148
- Who is she?
- "Who is she?"

237
00:21:41,227 --> 00:21:43,388
You do not wanna get in the ring
with me, mister!

238
00:21:43,462 --> 00:21:47,592
Honey, listen... Come on, baby.
There's nobody under there.

239
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,362
- You're acting crazy, sweetie.
- I'm gonna look under every single...

240
00:21:50,436 --> 00:21:53,337
Hey! I know this hairpin.

241
00:21:55,007 --> 00:21:58,374
Oh, I-I can explain that.

242
00:22:00,012 --> 00:22:03,880
You lovable lug,
Bert Zupanic!

243
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:06,645
I'm sorry, baby.
This is mine.

244
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:09,847
- Of course it is.
- I just get so jealous.

245
00:22:09,922 --> 00:22:12,914
- You forgive me?
- I forgive you.

246
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,552
- I'm in training. You've gotta
go to work. You're late.
- No. No.

247
00:22:15,628 --> 00:22:18,791
- I'm so wildly attracted
to you, Bert Zupanic.
- Hey, listen.

248
00:22:18,864 --> 00:22:21,992
- Good looks and charm.
What's not to love, all right?
- There's a lot to love.

249
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:25,059
- I know. You go on.
No! You have to go.
- But why... But...

250
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:28,937
- Will you call me at least? Bye.
- You bet. I'm on the phone now, okay?

251
00:22:36,115 --> 00:22:38,606
- Bert, did I hear voices?

252
00:22:38,684 --> 00:22:41,949
- Voices? I didn't hear any voices.

253
00:22:43,455 --> 00:22:44,979
Oh!

254
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,059
Oh.

255
00:22:59,772 --> 00:23:01,797
Where's the Titanic?

256
00:23:01,874 --> 00:23:03,739
What?

257
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:05,743
Your boyfriend,
the wrestler.

258
00:23:05,811 --> 00:23:07,745
Wow, talk about moves.

259
00:23:07,813 --> 00:23:09,940
I can't believe that
we barely just met.

260
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:12,381
He's supposed
to meet me here.

261
00:23:12,451 --> 00:23:14,385
He's coming here?

262
00:23:14,453 --> 00:23:17,149
He'd better be if he wants
that fight Saturday night.

263
00:23:17,222 --> 00:23:20,214
I'd better go freshen up a little.
I was just coming in for lunch.

264
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:30,667
Zupanic, hey.

265
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:38,540
Thought you were a no-show.
Talking to your girlfriend.

266
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,677
- My girlfriend?

267
00:23:42,747 --> 00:23:45,272
Holy shoot!

268
00:23:47,818 --> 00:23:49,752
What is that?

269
00:23:57,128 --> 00:24:00,894
- Now, how did she do that?
- Do what?

270
00:24:00,965 --> 00:24:03,695
I just saw her. I swear.
I just saw her go to the can.

271
00:24:05,469 --> 00:24:09,906
- She just went to the can?
- Ten seconds ago.

272
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:20,247
- What are you doing here?
- I have a business meeting.

273
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:23,548
Why don't I meet you
outside in the park?

274
00:24:23,621 --> 00:24:25,680
- I was just gonna get some lunch.
- Perfect.

275
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:28,247
- We'll have a picnic.
- A picnic? We never do that.

276
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:30,259
- Oh, yeah.

277
00:24:35,699 --> 00:24:38,065
Now...

278
00:24:38,135 --> 00:24:42,003
- Bert?

279
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:51,346
I have a little business
to attend to, sweetie.

280
00:24:51,415 --> 00:24:55,579
- You got more than that to attend to.
- Hey, Bert, I only got an hou...

281
00:26:01,819 --> 00:26:04,447
Mr. Zupanic?

282
00:26:06,757 --> 00:26:09,692
What happened?

283
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,955
Uh, there was
an incident.

284
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:16,659
You were struck
by flying glass.

285
00:26:16,734 --> 00:26:19,601
Did you lose something?

286
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,435
Yeah. My good luck.

287
00:26:24,508 --> 00:26:27,033
Would that be Betty
or Lulu, Mr. Zupanic?

288
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,141
'Cause they're the ones who
caused this, and they'll do it
again if we can't find them.

289
00:26:34,585 --> 00:26:36,780
Where are they,
Mr. Zupanic?

290
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,960
Excuse me.

291
00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:51,467
- F.B.I.
- Can I help you?

292
00:26:51,535 --> 00:26:55,301
Yes, I'm looking for...
that girl.

293
00:26:56,874 --> 00:27:00,366
Betty. This man's
from the F.B.I.

294
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:10,213
- Betty Templeton?
- I'm just getting off work.
Could we talk some other time?

295
00:27:10,287 --> 00:27:12,312
I think we both know why
I'm here.

296
00:27:13,657 --> 00:27:15,921
- It's her fault!
- Lulu Pfeiffer.

297
00:27:15,993 --> 00:27:18,689
She follows me around
trying to ruin my life.

298
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,925
I'm not gonna let her ruin it this time.
It's either me or her.

299
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:25,196
I don't want to leave Kansas.

300
00:27:42,253 --> 00:27:44,187
- Scully.
- Hey, Scully.

301
00:27:44,255 --> 00:27:46,189
I found her
at Koko's Copy Center.

302
00:27:46,257 --> 00:27:48,657
- Betty Templeton?
- Yeah.

303
00:27:48,726 --> 00:27:51,593
She says that Lulu Pfeiffer's
trying to ruin her life.

304
00:27:51,662 --> 00:27:56,122
- Follows her wherever she goes.
- Lulu Pfeiffer works at Koko's too.

305
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,725
That's exactly what
Lulu says about Betty,

306
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:02,238
except she says this is the end of
the line, that she's not leaving Kansas.

307
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:05,537
- That's exactly what Betty said.
- What's going on here?

308
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:09,136
I don't know, Scully. You're running
this show. Why don't you tell me?

309
00:28:09,213 --> 00:28:11,977
I think that this is more than
just physical proximity, Mulder.

310
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:15,314
I think that these women have some kind
of a psychic connection.

311
00:28:15,386 --> 00:28:17,320
- No...  Sherlock.

312
00:28:20,391 --> 00:28:22,552
Hey, Scully,
uh, where's Lulu?

313
00:28:22,626 --> 00:28:26,460
She just took off, Mulder.
She left work, and she drove away.

314
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,896
She wouldn't be driving
a little blue convertible, would she?

315
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:32,299
That's exactly
what she's driving.

316
00:28:35,806 --> 00:28:38,331
Oh, crap.

317
00:29:32,996 --> 00:29:34,964
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yes.

318
00:29:35,031 --> 00:29:37,693
I'm looking for someone.
He was here speaking to an employee,

319
00:29:37,767 --> 00:29:39,758
and I can't seem
to reach him.

320
00:29:39,836 --> 00:29:42,896
- Tall guy, dark hair? He left.
- Yeah.

321
00:29:42,972 --> 00:29:45,497
- And you don't know where he went?
- Couldn't say.

322
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,476
- Okay.
- However, I can tell you...

323
00:29:48,545 --> 00:29:50,740
we have a two-for-one
copy discount in effect.

324
00:29:55,118 --> 00:29:57,848
- How about Internet access?
- Right this way.

325
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,688
- Is he in there?
- Yeah. Sleeping.

326
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,095
- Can you wake him up for me?
- You sure you wanna do that?

327
00:30:09,165 --> 00:30:12,726
- It's important.
- Will you two shut up or go away?

328
00:30:12,802 --> 00:30:15,794
Mr. Damfuse?

329
00:30:15,872 --> 00:30:18,636
The sound of your voice
is like a jackhammer on my eardrums!

330
00:30:25,014 --> 00:30:27,778
Mr. Damfuse, I'm Special Agent
Dana Scully with the F.B.I.

331
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:30,649
What's so special
about you?

332
00:30:31,855 --> 00:30:33,823
It's an F.B. I title, sir.

333
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:37,121
I know it is.
I'm not stupid!

334
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:44,363
Mr. Damfuse, if you'll
let me explain why I'm here,

335
00:30:44,434 --> 00:30:46,368
we might be able to get you
to bed a little bit sooner.

336
00:30:46,436 --> 00:30:49,064
Ah! What a relief!

337
00:30:52,175 --> 00:30:54,735
Mr. Damfuse, through a lot
of matching up of documents...

338
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,745
that I have been able
to compile on the Internet...

339
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,611
and by comparing time and space
and circumstance...

340
00:30:59,682 --> 00:31:01,980
and by liberally applying
the law of averages...

341
00:31:02,051 --> 00:31:04,246
They could electrocute
me quicker!

342
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,423
I believe that you may be
the father of two daughters.

343
00:31:20,303 --> 00:31:22,464
I'm no father!

344
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:27,340
Using documents filed by a sperm bank
in Sparta, Illinois...

345
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:31,107
and by the mothers who may have been
impregnated by your donation...

346
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,274
I Yankee Doodled
into a plastic cup!

347
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:37,285
Well, be that as it may, sir,
it is very likely that you
are the biological father.

348
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:41,187
And it is very important for their
safety and for the safety of others...

349
00:31:41,257 --> 00:31:44,658
that we get as much information
as possible about your mother
and your father...

350
00:31:44,727 --> 00:31:47,127
and anything about your family tree
that may be able to explain...

351
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:49,529
the reactions that are being caused
by these two girls.

352
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:52,762
A big ugly dog lifted its leg
on my family tree!

353
00:31:52,836 --> 00:31:55,236
Make room for Daddy.

354
00:31:55,305 --> 00:31:58,741
Shut up, you fat ox!

355
00:32:15,592 --> 00:32:19,153
- Oh.
- You aren't answering your phone?

356
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:22,323
I'm just screening my calls.

357
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,889
You sleep with me once
and now you're avoiding me?

358
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:30,536
I got... big trouble, baby.

359
00:32:30,607 --> 00:32:33,940
I got just one shot left
for the big time. Just one.

360
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:37,605
But you got your match tonight.
Your name's up on the marquee.

361
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,773
I've lost my financing.

362
00:32:42,518 --> 00:32:45,749
- You're my good luck, baby.
- I am?

363
00:32:45,821 --> 00:32:47,755
It was my good luck
to meet you.

364
00:32:47,823 --> 00:32:50,553
And if you could just...

365
00:32:50,626 --> 00:32:55,120
- If you could help
the Titanic find a way.
- "Find a way"?

366
00:32:55,197 --> 00:32:57,597
They say I'm old,
I'm washed up.

367
00:32:57,666 --> 00:32:59,998
All I want's a shot.

368
00:33:00,069 --> 00:33:02,867
If I don't get the money,
I'm gonna lose my chance.

369
00:33:04,974 --> 00:33:07,772
Maybe I can.

370
00:33:38,073 --> 00:33:40,007
You're not answering
your phone?

371
00:33:40,075 --> 00:33:42,009
Lulu?

372
00:33:42,077 --> 00:33:46,070
Someone else you
were expecting? Well?

373
00:33:46,148 --> 00:33:49,982
Baby, I got trouble.
I got big trouble.

374
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:17,270
- Mulder?

375
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:19,273
- Yeah.
- Where have you been?

376
00:35:19,341 --> 00:35:23,277
Seeing a side of Kansas City
few men have the privilege to see.

377
00:35:23,345 --> 00:35:26,405
- What happened to you?
- I got sucked into a storm drain.

378
00:35:26,482 --> 00:35:30,714
The more pressing question is,
what the hell happened to Betty
Templeton and Lulu Pfeiffer?

379
00:35:30,786 --> 00:35:34,779
I don't know, but I have been able to
locate the nature of their connection.

380
00:35:34,857 --> 00:35:39,294
Both women are nonfraternal siblings
from the same father.

381
00:35:39,361 --> 00:35:43,627
- You've located him?
- Yeah. He's here in the state pen.

382
00:35:43,699 --> 00:35:46,133
When is all this yammering gonna stop?

383
00:35:46,201 --> 00:35:49,762
And he's
given you insight?

384
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:51,806
Well, the biggest thing that
I can figure out right now...

385
00:35:51,874 --> 00:35:54,968
is he's probably the angriest
man in the world, Mulder.

386
00:35:55,044 --> 00:35:57,444
Not as angry as those
two women are gonna be...

387
00:35:57,513 --> 00:36:01,005
when they both realize they're in love
with the one and only Bert Zupanic.

388
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:03,051
- They're both after him?
- They're both in love with him.

389
00:36:03,118 --> 00:36:05,848
That's why they're both staying
in Kansas City and they won't leave.

390
00:36:05,921 --> 00:36:09,288
Well, if they're the reason,
it doesn't explain what's happening,

391
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:12,623
what's causing this phenomenon
or how we're gonna make it stop.

392
00:36:12,695 --> 00:36:15,459
I don't know. You're the one who's
supposed to have all the answers.

393
00:36:15,531 --> 00:36:18,659
Somebody's got to get to that fight
and keep those two women apart,

394
00:36:18,734 --> 00:36:22,363
or else this time the...
is going to hit the fans.

395
00:36:22,438 --> 00:36:24,372
Well, hi.

396
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,674
Mr. Zupanic?

397
00:36:38,553 --> 00:36:41,989
- Goin'to Kansas City

398
00:36:42,056 --> 00:36:44,456
Kansas City, here I come

399
00:36:47,395 --> 00:36:50,330
Goin'to Kansas City

400
00:36:50,398 --> 00:36:52,593
Kansas City, here I come

401
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:54,794
- You said you'd have my money.

402
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:56,894
I'll have it.
I swear I will.

403
00:36:56,971 --> 00:36:59,462
I'll call off
the damn fight, Titanic.

404
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,940
I'll have these people
cursing your very name!

405
00:37:02,009 --> 00:37:04,477
I'm telling you
it'll be here.

406
00:37:04,545 --> 00:37:06,775
Don't worry.
I promise.

407
00:37:06,848 --> 00:37:09,180
Bert!

408
00:37:11,118 --> 00:37:13,450
Bert, I got it.

409
00:37:21,395 --> 00:37:23,761
How about ya, buddy?

410
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:28,067
Let's get ready
to rumble.

411
00:37:32,373 --> 00:37:35,433
Oh, baby, I knew you
wouldn't let me down.

412
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:38,171
It's you and me...
all the way.

413
00:37:44,452 --> 00:37:47,683
- Yeah!

414
00:37:58,266 --> 00:38:00,200
Ladies and gentlemen,

415
00:38:00,268 --> 00:38:03,237
get out your seats
and on your feets...

416
00:38:03,304 --> 00:38:05,238
for our own hometown boy,

417
00:38:05,306 --> 00:38:07,433
Whoo!

418
00:38:07,508 --> 00:38:11,069
Bert "the Titanic"...

419
00:38:11,145 --> 00:38:14,706
Zupanic!

420
00:38:16,984 --> 00:38:20,920
- Go, Titanic!
- Oh! Oh, yeah!

421
00:38:20,988 --> 00:38:25,220
Let's take him, baby!
Let's take him, baby!

422
00:38:25,293 --> 00:38:27,284
Whoo!

423
00:38:38,105 --> 00:38:40,039
- Whoo!

424
00:38:46,514 --> 00:38:48,448
Come on!

425
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:05,164
-  Titanic!

426
00:39:12,506 --> 00:39:14,440
Oh, yeah! Come on!

427
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,242
Whoo-hoo!
Go, Titanic!

428
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,745
You can do it, Titanic!

429
00:39:28,923 --> 00:39:31,289
Betty Templeton.

430
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,351
My name is Fox Mulder. I'm with
the F.B.I. Can you come with me?

431
00:39:34,428 --> 00:39:37,124
I'm watching the fight!

432
00:39:37,198 --> 00:39:39,666
Don't make me have to
remove you, ma'am.

433
00:39:42,436 --> 00:39:44,529
I can't believe this.

434
00:39:45,873 --> 00:39:47,807
What are you doing here?

435
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:51,367
What are you doing here?
I'm Bert's good luck.

436
00:39:51,445 --> 00:39:56,781
- He's mine!
- Over my dead body!

437
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:03,186
Stop it! Stop it!
You're going down, lady!

438
00:40:03,257 --> 00:40:05,555
I'm gonna kick your butt
from here till Tuesday!

439
00:40:05,626 --> 00:40:09,653
Stick a fork in you!
You're done! Hi, baby.

440
00:40:11,498 --> 00:40:15,161
- Betty?
- Bert, keep it up. I love you, baby!

441
00:40:15,235 --> 00:40:18,068
- Bert, I got the money.
- Lulu?

442
00:40:18,138 --> 00:40:20,538
Kick his butt, Bert.

443
00:40:28,115 --> 00:40:30,208
-  Lulu!

444
00:40:30,283 --> 00:40:32,148
No! Bert!

445
00:41:05,085 --> 00:41:07,019
Oh, my.

446
00:41:09,689 --> 00:41:12,283
Oh, my God!

447
00:41:21,368 --> 00:41:23,302
What?

448
00:41:27,107 --> 00:41:29,769
Why...

449
00:42:04,711 --> 00:42:06,645
Fifty million anonymous donations...

450
00:42:06,713 --> 00:42:08,647
have been made to sperm banks
across the U.S.

451
00:42:08,715 --> 00:42:11,707
Most have produced healthy offspring
for single mothers...

452
00:42:11,785 --> 00:42:16,984
or fertility-challenged couples
while some of them have not.

453
00:42:17,057 --> 00:42:20,493
Bert Zupanic and his nonfraternal
biological sibling...

454
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,257
both small-time bank robbers,
part-time pro wrestlers,

455
00:42:24,331 --> 00:42:28,062
both with too many idiosyncratic
behaviorisms to list...

456
00:42:28,134 --> 00:42:31,592
stood a 27-million-to-one chance
of ever meeting,

457
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:34,367
but they did.

458
00:42:34,441 --> 00:42:37,103
Damn, those are some odds.

459
00:42:37,177 --> 00:42:39,111
Betty Templeton and Lulu Pfeiffer...

460
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:41,477
products of different mothers
but the same father,

461
00:42:41,548 --> 00:42:44,517
an angry drifter now doing time
for counterfeiting...

462
00:42:44,584 --> 00:42:46,609
chanced to meet 12 years ago,

463
00:42:46,686 --> 00:42:51,214
but couldn't seem to avoid each other's
compulsively identical mannerisms...

464
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:55,057
mannerisms attributable to
their perpetually angry father.

465
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:59,394
Hmm. What does it
all mean?

466
00:42:59,466 --> 00:43:02,162
I've been thinking hard
about that, Mr. Saperstein.

467
00:43:02,235 --> 00:43:05,398
I would like to say it has something
to do with balance in the universe...

468
00:43:05,472 --> 00:43:09,067
the attraction of opposites
and the repulsion of equivalents.

469
00:43:09,142 --> 00:43:12,839
Or, that over time, nature produces
only so many originals...

470
00:43:12,913 --> 00:43:17,850
that when two original copies meet,
that the result is often unpredictable.

471
00:43:17,918 --> 00:43:21,319
If four should meet,
the result is...

472
00:43:21,388 --> 00:43:23,856
Well, suffice to say,

473
00:43:23,924 --> 00:43:27,519
it's betterjust to avoid
these encounters altogether...

474
00:43:27,594 --> 00:43:29,994
and at all costs.

475
00:43:31,131 --> 00:43:33,691
I think Agent Mulder
would agree with me.

476
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:37,601
Uh-huh.
