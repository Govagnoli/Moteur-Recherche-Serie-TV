Hello, Duane. Nice to see you.

21
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,029
Nice to see you too, Doc.

22
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,310
- How are you feeling today?
- Pretty good.

23
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,109
Why don't we sit down, Duane?

24
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,636
- I wanna go over a few things with you.
- OK.

25
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,918
Now, uh... it says here...

26
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,788
...that you've been refusing
to take your medicine.

27
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,874
- I don't like the way it makes me feel.
- OK. All right.

28
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,988
Let's talk about that. Because we give you
that medicine for a reason, Duane.

29
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,349
- Because of your behaviour.
- I know. I know.

30
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,830
Because we don't want you
to hurt anybody again.

31
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,709
Are you still hearing voices?

32
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,316
I'm not crazy, Doc.
Duane Barry's not like these other guys.

33
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,554
No, everybody here is different.

34
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,918
They're coming again.
They're coming again. I can feel it.

35
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,912
They're gonna take Duane Barry to the place.

36
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,309
Nobody's coming, Duane.

37
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,149
Nobody can stop 'em.

38
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,229
I'm gonna give you a shot.

39
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,194
I think you just need some rest.

40
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,070
This'll make you sleep.

41
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,508
And when you wake up, you'll see
we didn't let anybody hurt you. OK, Duane?

42
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,391
Duane?

43
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,232
Duane!

44
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,231
Get away. Get away.

45
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,433
- Put down the gun, Duane.
- Gimme the keys.

46
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,439
- Duane.
- Gimme the damn keys!

Either way, Doc, we're getting
outta here together. You got it?

50
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,031
Let's go, now! Go! Go! Go!

51
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,711
Agent Mulder.

52
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,951
Krycek. What's up?

53
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,352
There's a situation going down.
They want you right away.

54
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,635
What kind of situation?

55
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,750
A hostage negotiation.

56
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,796
- And they want <i>me?</i>
- Yeah.

57
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,553
- What for?
- The guy escaped a mental institution.

58
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:11,158
He's got four people at gunpoint in an office.
Claims he's being controlled by aliens.

59
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,353
- Krycek, Mulder. Where's the commander?
- Right that way, sir.

60
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,429
- OK, I got it right here.
- Lucy.

61
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,712
<i>(man)</i> You can put people
on the third and fourth floor.

62
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,119
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah.

63
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,191
Lucy Kazdin, negotiation commander.

64
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,239
- This is Agent Krycek.
- Let me show you what we've got.

65
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,114
His name's Duane Barry. He's armed with
a 9mm Smith & Wesson handgun...

66
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,872
...one 9-round magazine.

67
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,356
We believe that he's prepared
to use the gun and not afraid to die.

68
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,910
- What does he want?
- Safe passage for him and his hostage...

69
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,833
...a shrink named Hakkie.
- Passage to where?

70
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,478
He's bent on taking the doctor
to an alien-abduction site.

71
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,314
He can't quite remember where the site is,
so he stopped at a travel agency.

72
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,109
- Is he lucid?
- Yes, but off his medication, so he's manic.

73
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,432
Ranting about scoop marks, scars on his
body, homing devices and other nonsense.

74
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,635
Like what?

75
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,792
This alien-abduction business,
which I guess you know about.

76
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,952
Yeah, but I've never been
in a hostage negotiation before.

77
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,032
We'll take you through it.
Agent Rich is advisory commander.

78
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,510
- He and I will be coaching you.
- What Mr Barry needs is a friend.

79
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,720
Someone who appears to understand him
and can appeal to his sense of reason.

80
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,475
Do we know anything about
his abduction experiences?

81
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,714
You really believe
in this stuff, Agent Mulder?

82
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,791
Is that a problem?

83
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,238
We're here to save lives.
You'll begin negotiations immediately.

84
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,118
Every three hours
we'll re-evaluate your progress...

85
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,990
...and let our tactical commander
advise and update on the use of force.

86
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,832
If this man <i>is</i> an abductee,
I need to know more about him.

87
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,230
His personal history.
Each abduction case is different.

88
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,993
That material's not been made available to us.

89
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,719
Nobody's thought to call
the hospital for records?

90
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,272
Look, Agent Mulder, the guy's a psycho.
Your object is to keep him on the phone.

91
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,750
The longer you do, the more chance
he's not gonna kill anybody.

92
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,596
We stop to do a Freudian analysis, next thing
we know we've got four dead hostages.

93
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,390
So, whatever crap you gotta make up
about spacemen or UFOs...

94
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,869
...just keep him on the phone.

95
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,910
Are we gonna have to sit
on the floor like this all night?

96
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,795
I told you to shut up!

97
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,474
We all have families, for God's sake.

98
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,475
Duane, don't hurt anyone.

99
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,631
- Please?
- I'm not gonna hurt you, Doc.

100
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,195
Because this time
you're going with Duane Barry.

101
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,629
So you can see what it's like.

102
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,671
That it's real!

103
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,272
<i>(phone)</i>

104
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,159
- Duane?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

105
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,356
This is Special Agent Fox Mulder.

106
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,153
- Look, I wanna try to help you.
- Yeah?

107
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,519
Well... we're just sitting here
waiting for, uh... travel plans.

108
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,159
I think I know what
you're going through, Duane.

109
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,755
I just wanna make sure
you get what you want and that Bob...

110
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,071
...Kimberly, Gwen
and Dr Hakkie don't get hurt.

111
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,549
You know what I'm going through?

112
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,473
You think you know what Duane Barry's
going through?! You don't know jack!

113
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,636
I know you're scared, Duane. And that
you'd like to see this all come out right.

114
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,996
Yeah, right.

115
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,154
So they can put me back in the nuthouse...
where I belong.

116
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,555
We're only concerned about your safety,
Duane. You and the others.

117
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,919
Hey, what's your name?

118
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,991
Mul-dore?

119
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,156
I know the routine.

120
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,319
Honesty, containment...

121
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,315
<i>... conciliation. Am I missing something?</i>

122
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,234
You need someone to trust, Duane.

123
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,517
<i>I know a lot of people</i>
<i>who've been through similar experiences.</i>

124
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,515
You wanna do something for me, Agent
Mulder? You keep your dogs on a leash.

125
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,876
You try to gas me out or do
anything stupid, these people die.

126
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,588
They're not taking me again. You got it?
They can take somebody else!

127
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,797
- Nobody's gonna try anything, Duane.
- <i>(hangs up)</i>

128
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,839
Who is this guy? He's FBI, isn't he?

129
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,957
- Former FBI.
- And you didn't think to mention that?

130
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:33,798
He's been institutionalised on and off
for over a decade. It's beside the point.

131
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,429
The point being that the Bureau
wants to minimise its embarrassment.

132
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,636
That we can police our own.

133
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,598
They would like it done
as neatly and cleanly as possible.

134
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,800
- Well, you're off to a hell of a start.
- Negotiation is a process, Agent Mulder.

135
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,111
If you just wanted somebody
to read the script, you didn't need me.

136
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,079
This method has proven successful
in winning the hostage-taker's trust.

137
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,630
No. That man is afraid, and the only way
you're gonna win his trust...

138
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,553
...is by trying to understand
what he's afraid of.

139
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,473
Have you ever spoken
to an abductee, Agent Kazdin?

140
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,076
Heard them talk about having their brains
sucked out through their nostril?

141
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,232
- Wanna know what they do to your ovaries?
- Not particularly.

142
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,030
Well, then, understand that you might
have to alter your approach a little bit here.

143
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,630
Is there anything I can do?

144
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,393
- Yeah. What's your name again?
- Krycek.

145
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,790
- Krycek. Have you got your notepad?
- Yeah.

146
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,677
Grande, two per cent cappuccino
with vanilla. Agent Rich?

147
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,638
<i>As you can see, the SWATteam has taken</i>
<i>positions on all the surrounding buildings...</i>

148
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,109
- Scully.
- <i>It's me. I'm in Virginia.</i>

149
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,919
I know. I've been watching it on TV.
What's going on?

150
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,991
<i>What's the media saying?</i>

151
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,789
An escaped mental patient is holding
people hostage in a travel agency.

152
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,153
What they're <i>not</i> telling is he's former FBI
who claims to be an alien abductee.

153
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,596
- <i>Seriously?</i>
- His name's Duane Barry. I need your help.

154
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,468
<i>Find out what happened to him.</i>
<i>Transcripts from therapy sessions...</i>

155
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,916
...hypnotic regressions,
anything about his abduction.

156
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,240
- Mulder?
- <i>The lights just went out here.</i>

157
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,153
- <i>(man)</i> We're losing power.
- What the hell is goin' on?

158
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,591
<i>(woman screams)</i>

159
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,676
- Tactical Unit, what are you guys up to?
- <i>Absolutely nothing, sir.</i>

160
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,751
<i>What the?</i>

161
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,637
- <i>(gunshot)</i>
- Get down! Everybody get down!

162
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,110
Tactical Command, shots have been fired.
Locate and report.

163
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,713
<i>(gunshots)</i>

164
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,956
Negative. I've lost communication.
Waiting for orders, sir.

165
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,238
- We've lost our captured line.
- We have either four or five shots fired.

166
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,436
- What's the number in there?
- 5552804.

167
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,876
We have either four or five shots fired.

168
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,236
An electrical substation blew.
We've got no power.

169
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,356
- Duane?
- I told you.

170
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,352
- <i>Is everyone all right, Duane?</i>
- You didn't believe me.

171
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,910
No, I believe you.
I just need to know if anybody's been shot.

172
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,630
I need towels. Kimberly?

173
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,269
Kimberly? He's going to bleed to death.

174
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,196
I guess we're gonna need a doctor.

175
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,315
You'll have almost full ambient hearing loss
and your sense of balance may be affected...

176
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,791
...particularly if you have to move quickly
or get into a physical situation.

177
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,599
If you get trapped or held in the building...

178
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,638
...we'll be able to warn you
if there's a tactical assault.

179
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,508
And remember, he's either got
four or five rounds left.

180
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,592
There's a wireless mike
in the top of this flakjacket.

181
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,117
Speaking in a normal voice, we should hear
anything you say up to a hundred yards.

182
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,555
Attempt to keep these devices concealed.

183
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,474
If you put a telephone to that ear,
it'll reveal that you're wired.

184
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,357
- You really wanna do this?
- Yeah.

185
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,479
Your job will be to deliver medical help
to the hostage. Anything else is a bonus.

186
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,758
Get in and get out. You are not to risk
your own life. And whatever you believe...

187
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,594
Don't jump into his delusion.
I can't negotiate if he thinks I believe him.

188
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,673
Right. This is Agent Janus.
He's a trained medic.

189
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,150
He'll work on the hostage.
You're to keep Duane Barry talking.

190
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,995
Like I said, if he's talking, he's not gonna
shoot anybody - including you.

191
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,239
I've got three snipers out there.
Anything you can do to get him to the door...

192
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,835
All we need is one shot
to the medulla oblongata.

193
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,709
<i>Tact Command, this is rooftop zero two.</i>
<i>I have them in sight.</i>

194
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,550
<i>They're passing the fountain and</i>
<i>approaching the front entrance now.</i>

195
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,357
<i>(Duane Barry)</i>
Just unlock the door. Move back.

196
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,791
- Duane?
- Hands in the air.

197
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,071
- Put the kit on the floor slowly.
- We're unarmed.

198
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,031
- We just wanna help the injured.
- <i>(woman)</i> Over here.

199
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,230
Face the door!

200
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,709
That's right.

201
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,637
Not armed, huh? You're FBI, aren't you?

202
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,954
- Got a gun in the kit?
- No.

203
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,554
- Are you wearing a wire?
- No.

204
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,029
We're just here to help.

205
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,639
OK.

206
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,472
- <i>Nobody's gonna try anything, Duane.</i>
- That's right. You wanna work with him.

207
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,552
We just wanna make sure
no one else gets hurt.

208
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,029
Just do your business and get out.

209
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,149
- How's he doin'?
- He's bad.

210
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,151
Hi, my name is Janus. I'm a paramedic.
Hold on. We're gonna take care of you, OK?

211
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,518
They wanna work with you, Duane.
But you gotta work with them.

212
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,672
- Why not let the others go?
- Doc's going with me.

213
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,389
Then let the women go.

214
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,670
Were they here, Duane?
The light. Was that them?

215
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,670
- Don't try and BS Duane Barry.
- We lost time.

216
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,076
I checked my watch.
Isn't that what happens? Time stops? Isn't it?

217
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,397
Duane?

218
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,431
<i>(screams)</i>

219
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,671
<i>(screaming)</i>

220
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,554
- You're making it up.
- Isn't that what they've been saying to <i>you?</i>

221
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,599
- That you're making it up?
- They say it's all inside my head.

222
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,593
- All they wanna do is give me more drugs.
- I hear you, Duane.

223
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,514
- You hear me cos I got a gun.
- No, I believe your story.

224
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,229
No, you're feeding into his psychosis.

225
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,472
<i>I know you're afraid.</i>
<i>I know the pain and the fear you must feel.</i>

226
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,632
Just listen to me.
Don't try and identify with him.

227
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,555
I've talked to people, Duane. People
just like you who nobody wanted to believe.

228
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,519
This man's gonna die
unless we get him to a hospital.

229
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,989
Why don't you let him go, Duane?

230
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,869
There's no reason this man has to die.

231
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,078
Come on, Duane.
You've got the power. Let him go.

232
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,391
OK.

233
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:31,592
Good. You made the right choice. Now, we're
just gonna move him carefully to the door.

234
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,592
No! Baldie can go.

235
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,911
But you stay.
I'm trading the bald man for you.

236
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,715
Dammit!

237
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,911
They're coming out. Get him.

238
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,236
You're gonna be all right, sir.

239
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,435
Keep moving.

240
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,158
Now let's see how good a liar you are.

241
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,629
I'm telling the truth, Duane.

242
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,073
How could you ever know
what Duane Barry's been through?

243
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,908
How could anyone know?

244
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,829
It happened to my sister.

245
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,556
Don't you think you can lie to save their lives.

246
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,108
I want some honesty!

247
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,589
I want some respect!

248
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,749
I'm tired of all the BS!

249
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,630
How does it happen, Duane?

250
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,269
Driving in your car? Alone in bed at night?

251
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,159
When do they come to you?
You're paralysed, aren't you?

252
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,515
Unable to move.
Sometimes you can't even breathe.

253
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,558
You feel an electric shock
and then they're there.

254
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,074
He's gonna push him right over the edge.

255
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,674
I need a clear picture
of what's going on in there.

256
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,751
Right away.

257
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,878
You're choosing
a dangerous course, Agent Mulder.

258
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,397
There are beings, aren't there, Duane?
Are they tall? Or small?

259
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,391
- No!
- Diminutive?

260
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,073
They take you, Duane, against your will.

261
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,835
- He's gonna kill us.
- You're powerless.

262
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,232
Sometimes you can't even speak.
It's always the same. Nobody can help you.

263
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,389
Where do they take you, Duane?

264
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,359
Is there a ship?
Do they take you to a ship, Duane?

265
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,999
How do you get there?
Are you conscious of being transported?

266
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,151
<i>(Duane Barry) They're, uh...</i>

267
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,994
<i>They're talking to Duane Barry...</i>

268
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,550
<i>... but they don't speak.</i>

269
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,869
He can hear what they're saying.

270
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,873
They can... read his mind.

271
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,674
That's right. Abductees call it "mindscan".
It's a kind of telepathy.

272
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,714
I'm telling 'em I don't wanna go...

273
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,555
...but they never listen.

274
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,389
They know what I'm sayin'.

275
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,991
But they just...

276
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,998
...go right on about their business.

277
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,792
Tell him what their business is.

278
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,031
Tell him.

279
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,159
They take you aboard the ship
to perform the tests.

280
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,832
They... drilled my teeth.

281
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,551
They drilled holes in my damn teeth!

282
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,631
<i>(whimpers)</i>

283
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,031
<i>(whirring)</i>

284
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,271
<i>(screaming)</i>

285
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,117
<i>(phone)</i>

286
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,191
Yeah?

287
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,359
Who here can talk to an Agent Scully?

288
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,191
Agent Scully, it's Alex Krycek.

289
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,759
- Where's Mulder?
- He traded himself for one of the hostages.

290
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,229
- What?
- <i>He's in with Duane Barry.</i>

291
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,669
- Get him out of there.
- <i>They're working on it.</i>

292
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,513
No, get him out of there now
or he's gonna be killed.

293
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,549
- <i>How can you be sure?</i>
- Duane Barry is not what Mulder thinks he is.

294
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,438
How old was your sister when they took her?

295
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,751
She was eight.

296
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,360
I've seen kids sometimes. Young girls.

297
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,230
What are they doing to them?

298
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,311
Doing tests.

299
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,391
You know...

300
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,071
...testing 'em.

301
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,437
They tell 'em not to cry.

302
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,875
Are they hurting them?

303
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,951
Oh, yeah.

304
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,271
Sometimes...

305
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,516
...sometimes it hurts real bad and, uh...

306
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,712
...you just wanna die, you know?
You know what's it's like, sir?

307
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,952
It's like living with a gun to your head...
and never knowing when it's gonna go off.

308
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,909
You can let the others go, Duane.

309
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,838
Let the others go and take me.

310
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,471
Oh. They heard you talking like that,
they're gonna have your ass.

311
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,109
I don't care about that, Duane.

312
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,589
No. I wouldn't do that to you.

313
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,198
Besides, Doc and I got an appointment.

314
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,549
Ain't that right, Doc?

315
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,477
We got a picture.
Mulder is here, opposite the doctor.

316
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,519
The women are on the north wall. We can't
see the east wall. Barry must be there.

317
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,319
- Hold on a second.
- No. I don't think you understand.

318
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,868
- I just flew down from...
- We've got a situation...

319
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,758
- Let me talk to someone in charge.
- Calm down, Scully.

320
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,550
I'm not gonna calm down until I can talk to
someone who will listen to what I'm saying!

321
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,517
What's the problem here?

322
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,151
I'm Special Agent Dana Scully and I have
information that is vital to your negotiations.

323
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,994
- What information?
- I think there has been a misjudgment here.

324
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,277
This man who claims to be
under the control of aliens...

325
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,353
...his mental health history
describes a rare state of psychosis.

326
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,560
As you see from his medical records, in 1982
Duane Barry was shot in the line of duty...

327
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,117
...the bullet piercing his bilateral frontal lobes.

328
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,954
The injury left him nearly incapable
of functioning in society.

329
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,635
It effectively destroyed
the moral centre of his brain.

330
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,314
Almost a hundred years ago
there was a famous case.

331
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,710
A man named Gage had
a blasting rod pierce the same region.

332
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,916
And what effect did it have?

333
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,993
He became a pathological liar,
suffering from severe delusions.

334
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,550
His behaviour was characterised
as bizarre and violent...

335
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,712
...with a tendency to act out his fantasies.

336
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,072
How did you get involved in this case?

337
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,232
Agent Mulder called me.
We used to work together.

338
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,916
Well, if this is true, he's got
your former partner completely fooled.

339
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,993
Is there a way I can reach him
with this information?

340
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,314
The government knows about it, you know.

341
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,076
They're even in on it sometimes,
right there in the room when they come.

342
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,151
They work together.

343
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,516
With a, uh... secret, uh... corporation.

344
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,596
Who in the government?

345
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,389
A man. Military. They're all in it together.

346
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,399
<i>The government knows why they're here...</i>

347
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,950
<i>... but they wouldn't dare let the truth out,</i>
<i>so they cooperate.</i>

348
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,999
You're gonna have to deal with resolving
this situation, Duane, sooner or later.

349
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,471
I'm tired.

350
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,990
There's no other way out.

351
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,992
You've got to tell them what you wanna do.

352
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,356
- I just wanna go back to the place.
- What place?

353
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,193
Where it started.
Where they first came and got me.

354
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,271
Where <i>is</i> that?

355
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,034
A mountain.

356
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,910
<i>We went, uh... up and... up.</i>

357
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,071
Ascending...

358
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,995
...ascending to the stars.

359
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,471
I'm not going again.

360
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,278
- No.
- Mulder, it's me.

361
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,110
Listen to me. You cannot trust Duane Barry.

362
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,069
<i>He is a psychopath who took a bullet</i>
<i>in the head. He is not what you think he is.</i>

363
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,549
What?

364
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,359
How do they find you each time?

365
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,431
Implants.

366
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,469
My gums, sinus cavity...

367
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,756
...here in my bellybutton. Tracking devices.

368
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,834
<i>Mulder, he could snap at any time. He has</i>
<i>a history of irrational and violent behaviour.</i>

369
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,639
Now you have to work
towards resolving this.

370
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,032
Now, you have his trust.
You have to try and negotiate with him.

371
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,795
Why not let the women go, Duane?
They'll deal with you if you let the women go.

372
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,917
That's good. That's good, Mulder.
Now, keep him talking.

373
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,198
HRT is moving into position and unless
you can get him to free the hostages...

374
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,669
...they are going to execute a tactical plan.

375
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,072
The women are of no consequence to you.

376
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,390
Let 'em go.

377
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,948
It's the right thing to do, Duane.

378
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,514
OK, but he stays.

379
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,031
Go on. Get outta here.

380
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,151
Get up. Go on.

381
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,231
Get outta here. Go on.

382
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,597
I... I just want to say that I believe you.

383
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,198
OK, go!

384
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,555
Are we safe now?

385
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,119
- The women are clear.
- I got him. Standing, centre room.

386
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,511
Moving.

387
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,670
This is a countdown, Mulder.
They're coming at you.

388
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,510
- <i>Position one, ready.</i>
- Coming at you.

389
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,792
- We're gonna need transportation.
- What do you want, Duane? A car?

390
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,996
- I don't know.
- Do you know where you wanna go?

391
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,798
They're gonna tell me.

392
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,589
Duane, you can't leave here
if you don't know where you wanna go.

393
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,629
- Duane!
- What?

394
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,315
- Come here.
- Hold your fire. You lost your line.

395
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,990
- There's something I wanna ask you.
- What?

396
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,794
You didn't believe me.

397
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,474
I had to earn your trust.

398
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:02,031
Now there's something <i>I gotta know.
Are you making any of this up?

399
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,754
You, uh... calling Duane Barry a liar now?

400
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,198
No.

401
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,998
You think I'd make it all up?

402
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,435
No, I don't. I'm sorry.

403
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,678
- You're sorry?!
- Duane, will you listen to me for a second?

404
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,639
You're like all the others.
You say you believe me.

405
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,792
- I do believe you.
- You're lying just like everybody else!

406
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,871
I believe you, Duane!

407
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:49,151
- I trusted you! I trusted you! I was a fool!
- Can I... Can I say something?

408
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,276
Duane, can I say something?

409
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,751
I know you're tired, but there's
something you've forgotten to do.

410
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,189
When you let the women leave,
you left the door unlocked.

411
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,798
Go and lock the door, Duane.
Go lock the door.

412
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,114
Go lock the door, Duane. Go lock it.

413
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,554
They can get in here. Go lock the door.

414
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,431
<i>(man)</i> He's down! He's down!

415
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,471
<i>(distorted sounds and voices)</i>

416
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,753
<i>Code three. Repeat. Rolling code three.</i>

417
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,069
<i>Medical unit two zero. We're rolling.</i>

418
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,351
You OK, Mulder?

419
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,191
Yeah.

420
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,593
Whatever you're feeling,
you did the right thing.

421
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,473
I know. It's just that, uh... I believe in him.

422
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:41,151
Sometimes when you wanna believe
so badly, you end up... looking too hard.

423
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,678
- Agent Mulder. Thanks for coming.
- No, I was surprised to get your call.

424
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,675
Yeah, well, as it turned out, whatever
your impression of the way it was handled...

425
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,675
...I didn't get to thank you for going
out there and putting it on the line.

426
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,954
What?

427
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,716
I don't know. I guess I thought maybe
you'd called me down here to chew me out.

428
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,916
- How's he doing?
- Duane?

429
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,393
They almost lost him, but he's stabilised.
They've got him listed on critical still.

430
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,875
I checked on his record with the Bureau.
It was exemplary.

431
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,599
His accident was something of a mystery.

432
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,639
Shot by his own weapon in a drug stakeout,
left for dead in the woods.

433
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,276
He was never the same.
Lost everything - wife, kids, house.

434
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,629
The fine thread of sanity.

435
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,752
I actually called you down here
for another reason, Agent Mulder.

436
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,631
Uh...

437
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,276
In the X-rays, the surgeon
found several pieces of metal.

438
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:11,115
In his gums, in his sinus cavity
and one in the abdomen.

439
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,713
I had them checked. I felt you'd wanna know.

440
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:21,079
And there were tiny drill holes
in his left and right rear molars.

441
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,073
A dentist said they could not have been done
with any of the current equipment in use.

442
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:32,792
Not without chipping or damaging the tooth.
Anyway, I thought you oughta know.

443
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,875
This could just be a piece of shrapnel.
Duane Barry did a tour of duty in Vietnam.

444
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:01,637
It was right where he said it would be. Along
with the ones in his gums and his sinus.

445
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,915
And you think this was implanted?

446
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,790
Well, if it was, that would mean
Duane Barry is telling the truth.

447
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,269
Or some version of the truth.

448
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,556
Look, I'll take this down to ballistics.
We can have this cleared up in a second.

449
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,757
Let me just make a slight adjustment.

450
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,035
What do you think?

451
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,795
Could be a shell casing
or a small artillery refragment.

452
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,838
The edges are dull,
but it could've been white-hot.

453
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,115
That would make sense.

454
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,397
But look at this.

455
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,870
- What?
- These small markings. See them here?

456
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,631
Mm. Looks like some kind of a stamp.

457
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,554
Like it's been tooled or etched.
Pretty fine work too.

458
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,915
This square we're looking at
is only ten microns across. Strange.

459
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,871
Eleven fourteen.

460
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,191
Thank you.

461
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,392

incredibly strange happen.

470
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,599
This piece of metal they took out of
Duane Barry, it has some kind of a code on it.

471
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,429
I ran it through a scanner
and some kind of a serial number came up.

What the hell is this thing, Mulder?
It's almost as if...
