1
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:11,603
Unit Four, I got a fire
out on the highway at the 20-mile mark.

2
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,442
Unit Four, confirmation
of downed aircraft burning.

3
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,176
All units,
we've got a 10-13.

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,241
Unit Four,
this is Detective Miles.

5
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,617
I'm coming right at you, Ray.

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,521
Now, you wait for backup
before you head out, all right?

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,851
Unit Four, come back, Deputy.

8
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,134
Deputy Hoese.

9
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,476
- Ray?

10
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:29,113
Oh, my God.

11
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:27,669
Lariat car rentals totals...

12
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:34,284
Would you like
to see the figure?

13
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:43,390
- Is that a lot?
- A lot?

14
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:47,193
Gas, expenses,
the motel rooms alone...

15
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:49,530
By F.B.I. standards,
these numbers are out of control.

16
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,536
We could start sharing rooms.

17
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:56,098
You're under evaluation.
There has to be a point when we say no.

18
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,905
You can't really compare what we do
to other departments in the bureau.

19
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:02,607
- Right. This business with aliens.
- There's more to it than that.

20
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:05,673
But at the end of the day,
you'd say aliens are your real focus?

21
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:08,219
That's the reason
I got started, yeah.

22
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:10,755
Investigating
your sister's abduction...

23
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,018
and the government conspiracy
around it.

24
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,424
Both of which have
been resolved, correct?

25
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:19,363
Nothing has been resolved,
exactly.

26
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:24,061
In this case report here,
it's concluded your sister is dead,

27
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:26,696
as well as
the men who took her.

28
00:03:26,772 --> 00:03:29,070
This is your handwriting
here on the report, Agent Mulder?

29
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:31,200
Yeah.

30
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:34,040
So, what exactly is left
to investigate?

31
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,130
Your release
has been arranged.

32
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:01,739
Marita Covarrubias.

33
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:05,610
Last time I saw you,
I left you for dead.

34
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:09,011
Alex, if it was
strictly up to me,

35
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:11,276
I'd leave you here
to rot too.

36
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:18,981
I see the money bleed out,

37
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,754
but it just doesn't seem to make
the results of your work any better.

38
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:25,957
So many of the cases you investigate
are left unexplained.

39
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:28,431
Makes it hard
to justify the expense.

40
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,096
So much of the work that we do
cannot be measured in standard terms.

41
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:36,471
- How would you measure it?
- We open doors...

42
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,477
with the X-Files
which lead to other doors.

43
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,776
Doors leading to...

44
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:48,119
a conspiracy of men who
cooperated with alien beings...

45
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,815
"to create
human/alien hybrids...

46
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,723
so we could all become slaves
of an alien invasion."

47
00:04:57,496 --> 00:05:00,329
I believe that
there was once a conspiracy.

48
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,595
I believe I was taken by men...

49
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:07,196
who subjected me
to medical tests...

50
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:12,141
which gave me cancer
and left me barren.

51
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,873
But you don't
believe in aliens?

52
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:18,280
I've seen things
that I cannot deny.

53
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:30,995
Who sent you?

54
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:33,327
- The Smoking Man.

55
00:05:33,398 --> 00:05:35,923
He's dying.

56
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,441
You said you were finished.

57
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,342
I turned in my report and was asked
to go over a few things.

58
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,309
As you know, the times we live in,
the world is changing fast.

59
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,088
I'm missing your point.

60
00:05:58,924 --> 00:06:02,826
As I said, this is an evaluation,
Agent Mulder, to understand what you do,

61
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,693
so if you go forward,
you can do so more responsibly.

62
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,201
That sounds more
like a threat.

63
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,430
Cost benefit analysis.

64
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:15,405
But if you want the truth, I really
don't care one way or the other.

65
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:20,406
You mostly record bizarre facts
on bizarre cases.

66
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,538
In other words,
information gathering.

67
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:25,105
Something, it seems to me,
you can easily do on the Internet.

68
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:30,380
I can't do my job from an office.
I promise you.

69
00:06:30,455 --> 00:06:33,424
Nowadays, the most advanced
space exploration...

70
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:35,585
is done sitting in an office,
Agent Mulder.

71
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:40,462
Why? It's just too damn expensive
putting men in outer space.

72
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:43,899
- I'm not looking in outer space.
- Bringing us to the point.

73
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:46,699
If you spend so much time
and money looking for aliens,

74
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:48,899
responsibly you should
narrow your search.

75
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:52,466
- To where?
- Wherever they are.

76
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:54,478
It's not unreasonable.

77
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:56,480
It's just a matter
of reducing your vision.

78
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:13,093
Hey, you all right?

79
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:15,463
What's the problem?

80
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:17,870
- Isn't that your car, Mr. Miles?
- Yeah.

81
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:19,903
A small accident.

82
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:23,203
Everything's all right.
What are you boys doing out here?

83
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:26,369
Well, we heard
there was a plane crash.

84
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:29,380
Military jet fighter
collided midair with a U.F.O.

85
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:32,542
Navy found their plane
about three miles away.

86
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:36,054
We've seen no evidence
of any other crash.

87
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:39,215
But we heard a sheriff say
he saw a fire burning...

88
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,225
off the highway
at the 20-mile mark.

89
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:45,855
There's nothing out here.
No fire. No sign of fire.

90
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:49,992
Now, you boys go on home.

91
00:07:54,873 --> 00:07:56,807
There's nothing
to see here.

92
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:04,545
I think I'm in big trouble.

93
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:06,846
How many times have they tried
to shut us down?

94
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,685
Yeah, but I never actually
assaulted an auditor before.

95
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:14,954
- Did you hurt him?
- I reduced his vision a little bit.

96
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:18,656
- Mulder.

97
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,164
-  Agent Fox Mulder?
- Speaking.

98
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:25,567
My name is Billy Miles.
I don't know if you remember me.

99
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:27,628
Yeah, Oregon,
seven years ago.

100
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:31,540
You had multiple abduction experiences.
I'm here with Agent Scully.

101
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,078
- Billy, are you all right?
- Yeah.

102
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:36,637
This may seem weird,
me calling like this,

103
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:40,048
but, uh, I don't know
where else to turn.

104
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:43,884
- Is it happening again, Billy?

105
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,891
Yeah, but not to me this time.

106
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:57,567
More alien abductions, Scully.

107
00:08:57,636 --> 00:09:00,730
Mmm.

108
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:04,572
I don't know how we could
possibly justify the expense.

109
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,541
We'd probably
turn up nothing.

110
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:13,743
Let's go waste some money.

111
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:33,804
Hi. He's anxious to see you.

112
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:01,124
- I was worried about you, Alex.
- Cut the crap, old man.

113
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:04,100
I heard about
your incarceration.

114
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:06,194
You had me thrown
in that hellhole.

115
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:10,037
For trying to sell something
that was mine, was it not?

116
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:15,703
I hope we can
all move forward,

117
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:19,049
put the past behind us.

118
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:25,055
We have a singular
opportunity now.

119
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:30,288
- "Singular opportunity"?
- There's been a crash in Oregon.

120
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,362
An alien ship has collided
with a military aircraft.

121
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:39,895
Recovery is all important.

122
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:43,699
It's Roswell and Corona
all over again...

123
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:45,936
50 years later.

124
00:10:47,946 --> 00:10:50,881
It's our chance
to rebuild the project.

125
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,595
How do you know someone
hasn't already recovered it?

126
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:11,402
It's never quite so easy.

127
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:17,739
- I'm getting something here, Gary.
- I told you, Richie.

128
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:50,566
Hey, man, look at this.

129
00:11:50,642 --> 00:11:52,576
Gary!

130
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:57,813
Gary?

131
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,817
Come on, man.

132
00:12:47,928 --> 00:12:51,329
My dad got them to fudge
the psych qualifications.

133
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:54,835
- You're married, Billy.
- Uh, divorced.

134
00:12:56,404 --> 00:12:59,305
I live back
with my dad now.

135
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:01,307
You've never, um...

136
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,944
Have you ever been able
to get over the abductions?

137
00:13:05,012 --> 00:13:10,382
Well, I have, but people haven't.
No one really believes it.

138
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:14,785
My dad still denies it ever happened...
that any one of us was taken.

139
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:17,983
Does he deny
that it's happening now?

140
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:19,993
There was a crash.

141
00:13:20,061 --> 00:13:22,393
A navy pilot hit an unidentified
aircraft outside of town.

142
00:13:22,463 --> 00:13:24,727
Now, the military
found their jet,

143
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:26,960
but the other craft
hasn't been recovered.

144
00:13:27,034 --> 00:13:29,468
- Why not?
- Well, it's our county,

145
00:13:29,537 --> 00:13:31,471
and we're in charge
of coordinating efforts.

146
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:35,737
But my dad has really been no help,
even though we have a deputy missing.

147
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:40,372
You find the U.F.O.,
and he won't be able to deny the truth.

148
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,014
I hope that's all it is.

149
00:13:55,596 --> 00:13:57,530
What's going on, Bill?

150
00:13:57,598 --> 00:14:01,056
Just talking to some people
you might remember, Dad, from the F.B.I.

151
00:14:01,135 --> 00:14:03,501
- Agent Scully, Agent Mulder.
- Oh.

152
00:14:03,571 --> 00:14:06,267
What brings you folks
out here?

153
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,865
You're not thinking this incident's
some kind of U.F.O.?

154
00:14:08,943 --> 00:14:11,741
The crash of
an unidentified craft.

155
00:14:11,812 --> 00:14:15,771
Well, I've been on with the F.A.A.
You might want to follow up.

156
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,444
Looks an awful lot
like there was no crash at all.

157
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,612
Deja vu all over again.

158
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,241
That was there already, in case
you're wondering at all about it.

159
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:53,411
I watched Agent Mulder
paint that there seven years ago.

160
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:56,581
- What for?
- To mark an anomalous
electrical disturbance,

161
00:14:56,657 --> 00:14:58,591
the kind where time
gets bent or goes missing...

162
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:02,652
or where your car loses power
and dies in the middle of the road.

163
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,699
These skid marks are mine.

164
00:15:05,766 --> 00:15:09,099
That was the deputy's car up there
sitting there without his lights on?

165
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,331
If they'd been on,
I would have seen him.

166
00:15:12,973 --> 00:15:14,907
Good point.

167
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:23,481
Detective?

168
00:15:24,885 --> 00:15:27,854
Did the, uh,
deputy carry a.38?

169
00:15:27,922 --> 00:15:29,856
.38 super. Why?

170
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:32,916
Three shells were discharged.

171
00:15:32,993 --> 00:15:35,928
I imagine they could've
rolled from up there.

172
00:15:35,996 --> 00:15:39,523
- What was he shooting at?
- Probably nothing.

173
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,094
- Nothing?
- Nothing's all you seem
to find out here.

174
00:15:50,911 --> 00:15:53,641
Was the missing deputy
a good cop?

175
00:15:53,714 --> 00:15:55,682
Yeah, sure, I guess.

176
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:58,479
Married? Single?

177
00:15:58,552 --> 00:16:01,385
Bill!

178
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,519
- Come on over here with those.
- He was married. New baby.

179
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,344
You know, they only
want to solve this.

180
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,349
Get in the car, Bill.

181
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:58,077
- Yes?
- Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Hoese.

182
00:16:58,145 --> 00:17:00,943
- We're with the F.B.I.
- Is this about my husband?

183
00:17:01,015 --> 00:17:03,245
Are... You're Teresa?
Teresa Nemman?

184
00:17:03,317 --> 00:17:05,410
Yes.

185
00:17:05,486 --> 00:17:08,250
Seven years ago you came to
Agent Scully and I for help.

186
00:17:08,322 --> 00:17:11,951
- You were afraid of being abducted.
- Oh, my God.

187
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:15,757
- Uh...

188
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,763
Please come in.

189
00:17:24,204 --> 00:17:27,367
I'm sorry.

190
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:30,069
I sort of lost it
when I realized who you were.

191
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:35,014
We, uh, came to see if there's
anything that you can tell us...

192
00:17:35,082 --> 00:17:37,243
that might help us
find your husband.

193
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,446
We had no idea
you were his wife.

194
00:17:42,423 --> 00:17:44,857
I don't know
if it's important.

195
00:17:44,925 --> 00:17:47,758
Maybe I just hope
it's not, but...

196
00:17:47,828 --> 00:17:51,491
Ray and I have a connection...

197
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:53,658
that's even deeper for us.

198
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,972
He's an abductee too?

199
00:18:00,773 --> 00:18:03,139
He kept it a secret
from almost everyone.

200
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:05,268
It doesn't make you
real popular around here.

201
00:18:11,517 --> 00:18:15,317
His experiences were
a lot more terrifying than mine.

202
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:20,526
He was taken many times
and tested.

203
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:23,891
I have extensive
medical records on him...

204
00:18:23,963 --> 00:18:26,124
and photos of his scars.

205
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:30,101
- I'll get you the files.
Can you hold him?

206
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:33,104
It's okay. Thank you.

207
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:40,043
What do you see?
What do you see?

208
00:18:40,113 --> 00:18:42,604
What's that?

209
00:18:42,682 --> 00:18:47,483
- Once upon a time
there was a little baby

210
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:09,298
- Who is it?

211
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,309
It's me.

212
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,386
- What's wrong, Scully? You look sick.
- I don't know what's wrong.

213
00:19:21,454 --> 00:19:23,388
Come in.

214
00:19:28,361 --> 00:19:30,295
I, um...

215
00:19:30,363 --> 00:19:34,663
I was starting to get ready for bed,
and I started to feel really dizzy.

216
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:39,762
Vertigo or something. And then
I just... I started to get chills.

217
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:42,330
You want me
to call a doctor?

218
00:19:42,408 --> 00:19:45,070
No, I just...

219
00:19:45,144 --> 00:19:47,078
I just want to get warm.

220
00:19:54,353 --> 00:19:56,287
Oh, good.

221
00:19:57,356 --> 00:19:59,290
Thank you.

222
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:10,335
It's not worth it,
Scully.

223
00:20:12,505 --> 00:20:14,439
What?

224
00:20:14,507 --> 00:20:18,944
- I want you to go home.
- Mulder, I'm gonna be fine.

225
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:21,377
No, no, I've been thinking
about it.

226
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:24,382
Looking at you today
holding that baby and...

227
00:20:26,452 --> 00:20:29,080
knowing everything's
that been taken away from you...

228
00:20:31,991 --> 00:20:34,323
a chance for motherhood
and your health...

229
00:20:34,393 --> 00:20:36,327
and that made me...

230
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:40,729
think that...
maybe they're right.

231
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,291
Who's right?

232
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:45,633
The F.B.I.

233
00:20:49,876 --> 00:20:54,438
Maybe what they say is true,
but for all the wrong reasons.

234
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:56,744
It's the personal costs
that are too high.

235
00:21:00,186 --> 00:21:03,917
There's so much more
you need to do with your life.

236
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:07,459
There's so much more
than this.

237
00:21:15,835 --> 00:21:17,769
There has to be an end,
Scully.

238
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:37,686
In spite of a great deal of
effort, no one seems to be able
to find this U.F.O. of yours.

239
00:21:37,757 --> 00:21:39,691
Of course they can't.

240
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,784
You know why?
'Cause it's not here.

241
00:21:41,861 --> 00:21:43,886
It's there, Alex.

242
00:21:43,963 --> 00:21:46,261
I'm certain of it.

243
00:21:46,332 --> 00:21:48,391
Hidden in plain sight.

244
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:50,435
You listen to me.

245
00:21:50,503 --> 00:21:54,064
If you're gonna play games, Mulder
and Scully, they're gonna beat me to it.

246
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,667
Are you saying that Mulder and Scully
are there looking for the U.F.O.?

247
00:21:57,743 --> 00:21:59,836
They're looking for
a missing deputy.

248
00:21:59,912 --> 00:22:03,575
Well, they're looking for
the right thing, but in the wrong place.

249
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:06,049
You sent me
looking for a ship.

250
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:08,552
Find the deputy,
find the ship.

251
00:22:19,232 --> 00:22:21,166
Who is it?

252
00:22:24,103 --> 00:22:26,162
Ray?

253
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,272
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

254
00:22:33,346 --> 00:22:36,042
I was so worried.

255
00:22:36,115 --> 00:22:38,049
I-I was so sure...

256
00:22:38,117 --> 00:22:40,881
What did they do
to you this time?

257
00:22:43,022 --> 00:22:45,354
Ray, talk to me.

258
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:51,563
You're not my husband.

259
00:23:25,831 --> 00:23:28,527
No! No!

260
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,815
What happened, Billy?

261
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:49,511
Teresa's gone.
She's been taken. They took her.

262
00:23:49,585 --> 00:23:51,519
How do you know?

263
00:23:51,587 --> 00:23:53,521
The door was open.

264
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:04,397
Scully.

265
00:24:04,467 --> 00:24:06,401
The floor.

266
00:24:06,469 --> 00:24:08,403
What do you see?

267
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,543
The same thing as out on the road.
We've seen it before.

268
00:24:17,046 --> 00:24:18,980
Yeah.

269
00:24:22,685 --> 00:24:26,121
I have. We both have.

270
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:31,493
What is it?

271
00:24:32,662 --> 00:24:34,994
It's a biological toxin...

272
00:24:35,064 --> 00:24:37,328
emitted as a gas
through the bloodstream.

273
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,632
- From who?
- From what is arguably...

274
00:24:41,704 --> 00:24:43,729
an alien.

275
00:24:43,806 --> 00:24:46,297
Oh.

276
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:49,003
- You okay?
- Yeah.

277
00:24:49,078 --> 00:24:51,546
You sure?

278
00:24:51,614 --> 00:24:53,548
Yeah, I'm fine.
Thanks.

279
00:25:02,225 --> 00:25:04,056
Thank you, Greta.

280
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:13,666
Why the trouble to bring Krycek here
and then toy with him?

281
00:25:13,736 --> 00:25:15,897
Do you trust Alex, Marita?

282
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,907
- Then why bring him here at all?
- You misunderstand.

283
00:25:20,676 --> 00:25:23,611
I've great faith that Alex
will find the ship.

284
00:25:25,348 --> 00:25:27,714
But if I told him how,

285
00:25:27,783 --> 00:25:30,115
he'd be tempted
to sell the information.

286
00:25:30,186 --> 00:25:32,848
- And you're certain it's there?
- Oh, yes.

287
00:25:32,922 --> 00:25:34,947
But it won't be there forever.

288
00:25:36,926 --> 00:25:38,860
It's rebuilding itself.

289
00:25:38,928 --> 00:25:42,056
If he finds the ship,
then what?

290
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:44,827
To possess it...

291
00:25:44,901 --> 00:25:48,098
is to possess
the answer to all things.

292
00:25:50,706 --> 00:25:54,198
Every possible
imaginable question.

293
00:25:54,277 --> 00:25:56,745
To God?

294
00:25:56,812 --> 00:25:59,372
There's no God, Marita.

295
00:26:01,317 --> 00:26:03,911
What we call God
is only alien...

296
00:26:03,986 --> 00:26:07,285
an intelligence
much greater than us.

297
00:26:08,357 --> 00:26:10,291
They're coming here,
aren't they?

298
00:26:12,461 --> 00:26:14,986
They're only coming back.

299
00:26:28,244 --> 00:26:30,178
Mulder?

300
00:26:34,817 --> 00:26:37,342
Hey!

301
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,287
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I was just standing there.
Is that against the law?

302
00:26:40,356 --> 00:26:43,382
- You know this guy?
- Yeah.

303
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:46,622
- What are you doing, Richie?
- They took him.

304
00:26:46,696 --> 00:26:48,789
They took Gary.
He-He was just gone.

305
00:26:48,864 --> 00:26:51,731
- Relax. Slow down.
- They're out there!

306
00:26:51,801 --> 00:26:54,964
- I don't care what your dad says, Billy.
- My dad?

307
00:26:55,037 --> 00:26:57,335
He was out there too.
He knows.

308
00:27:09,986 --> 00:27:14,047
I was shining my flashlight
in the dark, looking for the U.F.O.,

309
00:27:14,123 --> 00:27:16,114
and, uh,

310
00:27:16,192 --> 00:27:18,319
the beam hit this spot
in space,

311
00:27:18,394 --> 00:27:20,521
like it bent the light.

312
00:27:21,864 --> 00:27:23,130
- And then what happened?
- Well, I yelled, "Gary!"

313
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,189
- And then what happened?
- Well, I yelled, "Gary!"

314
00:27:25,265 --> 00:27:29,861
And I looked, but he wasn't there.
He wasn't anywhere, man.

315
00:27:29,936 --> 00:27:33,702
And then the flashlight got really hot,
and I dropped it.

316
00:27:33,773 --> 00:27:37,072
Uh, it was right around
here somewhere.

317
00:27:56,196 --> 00:27:58,130
Oh, hey, here it is.

318
00:28:05,138 --> 00:28:06,696
Scully?

319
00:28:17,117 --> 00:28:19,051
Scully?

320
00:28:20,253 --> 00:28:23,745
- Scully.

321
00:28:23,823 --> 00:28:25,757
- You want some water?
- What happened to her?

322
00:28:25,825 --> 00:28:28,760
- Can you just get her some water?

323
00:28:28,828 --> 00:28:31,922
I just... I just...

324
00:28:31,998 --> 00:28:33,932
I just hit the ground.

325
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,968
Here, lie still.

326
00:28:36,036 --> 00:28:38,561
Why is this
happening to me?

327
00:28:38,638 --> 00:28:40,572
It's okay. It's okay.

328
00:28:43,176 --> 00:28:45,906
- What the hell's going on, Mulder?
- I don't know.

329
00:28:45,979 --> 00:28:48,470
But these aren't just
random abductions, Scully.

330
00:28:48,548 --> 00:28:52,040
- We've gotta warn Billy Miles of that.
- Of... Of what?

331
00:28:52,118 --> 00:28:55,383
These abductees aren't just
systematically being taken.

332
00:28:57,624 --> 00:29:00,252
They're not coming back.

333
00:29:08,602 --> 00:29:10,536
Dad?

334
00:29:24,217 --> 00:29:26,151
Billy?

335
00:29:27,687 --> 00:29:30,087
- What are you doing?
- You stay where you are.

336
00:29:30,156 --> 00:29:33,853
- Billy, it's me.
- I said, stay where you are!

337
00:29:33,927 --> 00:29:36,896
- Damn it, Billy, listen to me.
- No.

338
00:29:36,963 --> 00:29:40,455
I don't know who you are,
but you are not gonna take me.

339
00:29:40,533 --> 00:29:43,024
I'm your father.

340
00:29:45,372 --> 00:29:48,136
Are you gonna
shoot your father?

341
00:29:49,643 --> 00:29:52,476
If you're my father,

342
00:29:52,545 --> 00:29:54,479
then why won't
you believe me?

343
00:29:54,547 --> 00:29:56,777
I believe you, Billy. I...

344
00:29:58,752 --> 00:30:00,879
I just want it
all to go away.

345
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:08,193
Give me the gun, son.

346
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:48,133
Billy?

347
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:59,335
Billy!

348
00:31:20,499 --> 00:31:23,525
- Agent Mulder?
- What's our punishment this time?

349
00:31:23,602 --> 00:31:26,127
Thumb screws or 40 lashes?

350
00:31:30,743 --> 00:31:32,677
Come on in, Walter.
Sit a spell.

351
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:36,272
This could be the last time you
take a trip down to these offices.

352
00:31:36,348 --> 00:31:38,407
You went to Oregon.

353
00:31:39,485 --> 00:31:41,885
Guilty as charged.

354
00:31:41,954 --> 00:31:45,651
And if they're coming down on you
for that, I'm sorry. I truly am.

355
00:31:45,724 --> 00:31:49,251
Fortunately, they think that I make
a contribution to the bureau.

356
00:31:49,328 --> 00:31:51,262
Oh, well, yeah.

357
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:53,423
Stick to a budget, and they say
you're making a contribution.

358
00:31:53,499 --> 00:31:56,468
But push the limits of your profession,
and they say you're out of control.

359
00:31:56,535 --> 00:32:00,096
You could bring home a flying
saucer and have an alien
shake hands with the president.

360
00:32:00,172 --> 00:32:04,609
What it comes down to, Agent Mulder,
is... they don't like ya.

361
00:32:04,677 --> 00:32:08,807
Well, we didn't bring home
a flying saucer or an alien.

362
00:32:08,881 --> 00:32:11,315
Yeah. So I've been told.

363
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:27,021
Agent Mulder! I think
you should listen to him.

364
00:32:28,901 --> 00:32:31,529
You've got every reason
to wanna see me dead,

365
00:32:33,105 --> 00:32:36,006
but you gotta
listen to me now.

366
00:32:37,343 --> 00:32:39,868
You're the singular
opportunity.

367
00:32:39,945 --> 00:32:42,379
- Here, or do you want to step outside?
- Agent Mulder.

368
00:32:44,383 --> 00:32:46,510
Cancer Man is dying.

369
00:32:50,756 --> 00:32:52,690
His last wish
is to rebuild his project,

370
00:32:52,758 --> 00:32:54,692
to have us revive
the conspiracy.

371
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,694
It all begins in Oregon.

372
00:32:56,762 --> 00:33:02,166
The ship that collided with
that navy plane... it's in those woods.

373
00:33:02,234 --> 00:33:05,260
- There's no ship in those woods.
- Yeah, it's there,

374
00:33:05,337 --> 00:33:09,671
cloaked in an energy field
while he mops up the evidence.

375
00:33:09,742 --> 00:33:12,802
- Who?
- The alien bounty hunter.

376
00:33:12,878 --> 00:33:17,406
Billy Miles, Teresa Hoese,
her husband.

377
00:33:17,483 --> 00:33:19,417
He's eliminating proof
of all the tests.

378
00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:25,618
See, we're asking ourselves... We're
asking ourselves, "Where are they?"

379
00:33:25,691 --> 00:33:29,821
They're right there.
They're right under our noses.

380
00:33:29,895 --> 00:33:32,830
But I'm giving you
the chance to change that...

381
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:36,929
to hold the proof.

382
00:33:37,002 --> 00:33:39,766
Why me? And why now?

383
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:46,833
I wanna damn the soul of that
cigarette-smoking son of a bitch.

384
00:33:48,447 --> 00:33:50,381
Mulder?

385
00:34:02,661 --> 00:34:05,528
What's amazing is that even
the military satellites don't see this.

386
00:34:05,598 --> 00:34:08,533
ButJ.P.L. 's TOPEX/Poseidon
shows it only as waveform data.

387
00:34:08,601 --> 00:34:11,263
And here it appears simply as
a microburst of transmission error...

388
00:34:11,337 --> 00:34:13,430
on the European Space Agency's
ERS-2.

389
00:34:13,505 --> 00:34:17,305
- In other words?
- In other words,
you'd never know it's a U.F.O.

390
00:34:17,376 --> 00:34:20,641
If you didn't know what you
were looking at or looking for.

391
00:34:20,713 --> 00:34:23,739
- No wonder we couldn't see them.
- It is not gonna be there forever.

392
00:34:23,816 --> 00:34:26,478
As we all stand here talking,
it's rebuilding itself.

393
00:34:43,535 --> 00:34:45,469
Mulder, if any of this
is true...

394
00:34:45,537 --> 00:34:48,062
If it is or if it isn't,
I want you to forget about it.

395
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,608
- Forget about it?
- You're not going back out there.

396
00:34:50,676 --> 00:34:54,476
- I'm not gonna let you
go back out there.
- What are you talking about?

397
00:34:54,546 --> 00:34:56,980
It has to end sometime.
That time is now.

398
00:34:57,049 --> 00:35:00,917
- Mulder...
- You have to understand.
They're taking abductees.

399
00:35:02,087 --> 00:35:04,021
You're an abductee.

400
00:35:05,991 --> 00:35:08,425
I'm not gonna risk...

401
00:35:08,494 --> 00:35:10,428
Iosing you.

402
00:35:25,077 --> 00:35:27,204
I won't let you go alone.

403
00:35:40,526 --> 00:35:43,256
This is starting to feel like
the snipe hunt I was afraid of.

404
00:35:43,328 --> 00:35:45,262
There's no such thing
as a snipe, sir.

405
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:47,525
My ass is on the line here too,
Agent Mulder.

406
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,726
I know that.

407
00:36:02,381 --> 00:36:04,315
This just can't be.

408
00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:07,485
What are you looking at?

409
00:36:07,553 --> 00:36:09,919
Medical records.
Billy Miles...

410
00:36:09,988 --> 00:36:12,513
and other known abductees
in Bellefleur, Oregon.

411
00:36:12,591 --> 00:36:18,086
- They all experience
anomalous brain activity.
- Electroencephalitic trauma.

412
00:36:18,163 --> 00:36:21,360
Which is exactly what Mulder
experienced earlier this year.

413
00:36:21,433 --> 00:36:25,529
- I don't understand.
- There was something
out there in that field.

414
00:36:25,604 --> 00:36:28,835
It knocked me back
because it didn't want me.

415
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:33,836
Mulder thinks that it's me
that's in danger of being taken.

416
00:36:36,548 --> 00:36:38,743
When it's Mulder
who's in danger.

417
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:42,453
Scully?

418
00:36:42,521 --> 00:36:46,048
- Scully!
- Are you okay?

419
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,100
How's it
supposed to work?

420
00:36:57,169 --> 00:36:59,967
Not exactly sure, sir.

421
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,874
- But, um,

422
00:37:03,942 --> 00:37:06,809
budgetarily, I'd say
we're looking pretty good.

423
00:37:45,582 --> 00:37:48,449
Agent Mulder.!

424
00:38:01,798 --> 00:38:03,663
Mulder!

425
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,865
Mulder!

426
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:44,633
Mulder.

427
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:03,418
We failed.

428
00:40:06,623 --> 00:40:10,059
Perhaps you never meant
to succeed.

429
00:40:13,696 --> 00:40:16,392
Anyway,

430
00:40:16,466 --> 00:40:20,061
the hour is at hand,
I presume.

431
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:26,006
What are you doing?

432
00:40:26,076 --> 00:40:28,010
Sending the devil
back to hell.

433
00:40:32,048 --> 00:40:35,211
As you do to Mulder
and to me,

434
00:40:36,286 --> 00:40:39,221
you do to
all of mankind, Alex.

435
00:41:25,034 --> 00:41:26,968
Agent Scully.

436
00:41:28,304 --> 00:41:30,238
- Hi.
- Hi.

437
00:41:34,244 --> 00:41:36,178
How are you feeling?

438
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:40,641
I'm feeling fine.

439
00:41:40,717 --> 00:41:42,651
They're just running
some tests on me.

440
00:41:51,427 --> 00:41:53,827
Uh...

441
00:41:56,666 --> 00:41:58,600
I already heard.

442
00:42:01,804 --> 00:42:06,400
I lost him. I don't know
what else I can say. I lost him.

443
00:42:10,647 --> 00:42:12,581
I'll be asked...

444
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,784
what I saw.

445
00:42:18,955 --> 00:42:21,617
And what I saw
I can't deny.

446
00:42:26,596 --> 00:42:28,530
I won't.

447
00:42:38,841 --> 00:42:40,775
We will find him.

448
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:49,484
I have to.

449
00:42:58,394 --> 00:43:00,328
Sir, um,

450
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:05,259
there's something else
I need to tell you.

451
00:43:12,742 --> 00:43:16,143
Something that I need
for you to keep to yourself.

452
00:43:17,714 --> 00:43:20,148
I'm having a hard time...

453
00:43:20,216 --> 00:43:22,150
explaining it...

454
00:43:24,153 --> 00:43:26,519
or believing it,

455
00:43:26,589 --> 00:43:28,523
but, um,

456
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,434
I'm pregnant.
