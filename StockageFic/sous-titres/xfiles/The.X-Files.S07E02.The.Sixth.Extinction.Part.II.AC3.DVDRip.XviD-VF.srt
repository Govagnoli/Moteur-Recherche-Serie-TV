1
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:21,779
We've exhausted all medical
and scientific evidence.

2
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:25,621
By that I mean nothing
we can find... no disease,
no hint of disease. Only symptoms.

3
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:30,129
The brute fact is he's experiencing
so much activity in his temporal lobe...

4
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,664
that it is effectively
destroying his brain.

5
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:35,496
Enough!

6
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,593
There's only so much bluntness
a mother can take.

7
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,969
- Sorry. I just...
- All you do is sedate him.

8
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,305
You're turning him...

9
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:47,404
into a zombie.

10
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,946
I know you can hear me, Fox.

11
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:00,823
- Can you give me a sign?
-  I can hear you, Mom.

12
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,987
Fox?

13
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,293
Mom, I can hear you.

14
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:07,959
I'm here.

15
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,366
I love you, my darling boy.

16
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,371
Mom, where you going?

17
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,670
Mom? Mom?

18
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,568
Come back, Mom!

19
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,206
Mom!

20
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,648
Mom!

21
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,982
Mom!

22
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,894
When in disgrace
with fortune in men's eyes.

23
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:50,067
Ah, but your mommy
will still love you.

24
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,703
All a mother wants is to...

25
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,839
shield her boy
from pain and danger.

26
00:01:55,915 --> 00:02:00,284
Safe in the world
as he was once in the womb.

27
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:03,516
But maybe we think a father
demands more than mere survival.

28
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,390
Maybe we're afraid a father demands
worldly adulation.

29
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,793
Success, heroism.

30
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,699
I know you can hear me.

31
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,704
I can always hear you.

32
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:24,234
Even when my mind is jammed
with a thousand voices,

33
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,677
I can hear you like a snake
hissing underneath.

34
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:30,910
How the hell
did you get in here?

35
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,420
How does anything I do
surprise you now?

36
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,422
Aren't you expecting me
to sprout vampire fangs?

37
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,755
You've come to kill me.

38
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:45,493
It'd be better than living
like a zombie, wouldn't it?

39
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,776
I'm giving you a choice.

40
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,749
- What choice?
- Life or death.

41
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,517
Your account is squared
with me, with God,

42
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,993
with the I.R.S.,
with the F.B.I.

43
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,030
Rise out of your bed
and come with me.

44
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:21,828
I'm dying, you idiot.

45
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,369
If I could get up,
I'd kick your ass.

46
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:28,430
Don't be so dramatic.
Only part of you is dying...

47
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:32,000
the part that played
the hero.

48
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,603
You suffered enough...

49
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,673
for the X-Files,
for your partner,

50
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,684
for the world.

51
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,744
You're not Christ.

52
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,347
You're not Prince Hamlet.

53
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,360
You're not even Ralph Nader.

54
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:52,387
You can walk out of this hospital
and the world will forget you.

55
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:55,025
Arise.

56
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,375
What... What the hell
are you doing to me?

57
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,573
I'm showing you how to take
the road not taken.

58
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,583
Take my hand.

59
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,348
- Why should I take your hand?
- You can't read my mind?

60
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,419
No. I can't.

61
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,589
- All the voices are gone.
- Take my hand, Fox.

62
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,271
You have to take
the first step.

63
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,074
Take my hand.

64
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,449
I'm your father.

65
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,571
Sleep is a luxury, Agent Scully.
A self-indulgence we have no time for.

66
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:51,616
- Nor does Agent Mulder.
- How did you get in here?

67
00:05:53,952 --> 00:05:55,886
Getting in is easy.

68
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:58,286
It's what you do once
you're inside that's key.

69
00:05:58,356 --> 00:06:02,690
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You are the only one
with access to Mulder.

70
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:06,356
- I need you to use it wisely.
- Like you?

71
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:10,094
Almost killing him by shooting
him full of phenytoin for
a few moments of lucidity?

72
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:13,660
It's what Agent Mulder wanted.
He knows what's wrong.

73
00:06:13,738 --> 00:06:17,572
What he wants now is to prove it.
It's why he asked for me, not you.

74
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:20,202
I don't believe that.

75
00:06:20,278 --> 00:06:24,977
Two years ago your partner was infected
with a virus he claimed was alien.

76
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:30,215
A virus reactivated in him by exposure
to a source of energy, also alien.

77
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:34,987
Agent Mulder is living proof of what
he tried so long to substantiate...

78
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,756
the existence of alien life.

79
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:41,788
But whatever it is,
it's killing him.

80
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:44,062
And we have to get it
out of him.

81
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:48,497
You destroy this
and I'll destroy you.

82
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:06,955
- Scully.
-  Agent Scully,
you need to go to the hospital.

83
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:10,825
- What happened?
- Mulder's gone. He's disappeared.

84
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:18,298
There were guards posted here.
A man who's gravely ill doesn't
just get up and disappear.

85
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,168
- I know, I know.
- How did this happen?

86
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:24,675
- His mother checked him out.
- His mother?

87
00:07:24,743 --> 00:07:28,008
- That's what they're saying.
- Has anybody spoken with her?

88
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:33,346
I'm leaving that up to you.
It's better I not be involved
any further in this case.

89
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:38,287
Sir, this isn't just a case. This is
Agent Mulder we're speaking about.

90
00:07:38,356 --> 00:07:41,052
And I'm trying
to help him...

91
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:43,788
by staying out of this
from now on.

92
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:45,796
Sir?

93
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,659
I'm in a compromised position.

94
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:54,865
The less I know about Agent Mulder's
whereabouts and yours,

95
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,067
the better.

96
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:19,063
The child is father to the man.

97
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,190
You've been asleep
quite a while.

98
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:26,499
I suspect it'll be sometime before
your sleep patterns return to normal.

99
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:33,777
Would you like an explanation?

100
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:35,779
I'm not sure.

101
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:40,375
While you were lying unconscious
in the hospital this afternoon,
my doctors worked on you.

102
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:44,912
- Why?
- At some point I realized that...

103
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,891
if the Syndicate didn't kill you,
the F.B.I. would.

104
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:52,623
If the F.B.I. didn't kill you,
your own misguided heroism would.

105
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:56,394
There's really
no way out for you.

106
00:08:56,468 --> 00:09:00,404
There's no way for you
to cheat death except by disappearing.

107
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:04,541
A man can't just disappear.

108
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:08,204
Oh, we've made
entire cultures disappear.

109
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,080
Like me now, you'll become
a man without a name.

110
00:09:13,985 --> 00:09:17,148
But even while you miss
your former identity,

111
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:20,817
you'll learn to love
life's simpler pleasures.

112
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:23,122
Well, that'll be kind of tough
with these on.

113
00:09:23,194 --> 00:09:25,754
When you no longer wanna run,
those will come off.

114
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:29,058
How do you feel?

115
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:31,659
I feel better than I did.

116
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:37,435
I gotta tell Scully.
I gotta tell her.

117
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:41,240
If you do have contact with her,
you'll put her in danger.

118
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:44,805
You're entering a kind of...

119
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:48,182
witness protection program
for want of a better term.

120
00:09:57,162 --> 00:10:01,496
- Can I offer you a cigarette?
- I don't smoke.

121
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:03,966
Well, maybe now you do.

122
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:50,810
Don't move.

123
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:54,249
- Who's there?
-  I don't mean to frighten you.

124
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:57,015
Albert Hosteen.

125
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:03,352
What are you doing here?
How did you get here?

126
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:07,421
- I'm sorry to surprise you.
- Surprise?

127
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:11,795
That you're standing here...

128
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,839
Last time I saw you
was in New Mexico.

129
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:18,364
They'd taken you from the hospital.
Your doctors feared the worst.

130
00:11:18,443 --> 00:11:22,402
- I was hoping to see your partner.
- He's missing.

131
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,380
You must save him.

132
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:27,009
He's very ill.

133
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:29,519
You must find him
before something happens.

134
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:31,714
Not only for his sake,

135
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,190
for the sake of us all.

136
00:11:49,873 --> 00:11:52,171
- Where are we?
- Home.

137
00:11:55,345 --> 00:11:57,438
This is your new life.

138
00:12:00,984 --> 00:12:02,884
I don't understand.

139
00:12:10,226 --> 00:12:13,059
You can drive away
right now.

140
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:17,429
Drive back to Scully and your X-Files
and imminent death.

141
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,593
I wouldn't be surprised
if you did.

142
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:22,661
But I think you should
take a look around.

143
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:27,073
I mean, why leave something
behind until you... until you
know what it is you're leaving?

144
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:41,880
Mulder was taken out of
the hospital just before 2:00 a.m.

145
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,587
His mother's signature
is on the hospital documents.
It's her handwriting.

146
00:12:45,662 --> 00:12:49,098
She checked him out A.M. A...
against medical advice.

147
00:12:50,467 --> 00:12:52,867
It's all legitimate
until you go to surveillance.

148
00:12:52,936 --> 00:12:55,632
This is a camera in the hall
outside Mulder's room.

149
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,308
Here's inside his room.

150
00:12:59,376 --> 00:13:02,038
And two other cameras
on the ward.

151
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:05,104
We're guestimating there were
at least three others involved.

152
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:07,308
Check this out.

153
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,987
Where's Waldo?

154
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:19,159
She's talking to someone.

155
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:21,390
Yeah.

156
00:13:25,502 --> 00:13:27,493
I know who that is.

157
00:13:31,641 --> 00:13:33,666
Hello?

158
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:40,015
Anybody home?

159
00:14:03,907 --> 00:14:05,932
They can change your name,

160
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:09,945
but they can't change
the things you love.

161
00:14:11,347 --> 00:14:13,281
It can't be.

162
00:14:15,185 --> 00:14:17,949
- You're dead.
-  No.

163
00:14:18,021 --> 00:14:20,785
No, just really relaxed.

164
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,620
Scully...
saw you get shot...

165
00:14:25,695 --> 00:14:28,858
on the bridge six years ago.

166
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:31,765
I was sure you were... dead.

167
00:14:35,738 --> 00:14:38,707
One, uh, well-placed bullet.

168
00:14:40,844 --> 00:14:45,577
A punctuation mark on a man's life and
you get to start a whole new chapter.

169
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,717
I'm fine, son,

170
00:14:48,785 --> 00:14:52,152
aside from a little tennis elbow.

171
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:06,126
I felt responsible
for your death.

172
00:15:06,202 --> 00:15:09,569
You can let that go.
Clearly I'm alive.

173
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:12,802
I thought that you died
for my quest.

174
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:16,676
Yes, along with Scully's sister and
the man you thought was your father...

175
00:15:16,746 --> 00:15:21,274
and Duane Barry and-and
even Scully's mysterious illness...

176
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:24,252
and on and on and on.

177
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,550
You can let go
of all that guilt.

178
00:15:26,623 --> 00:15:29,956
I'm here to tell you that
you're not the hub of the universe...

179
00:15:30,026 --> 00:15:32,517
the cause of life and death.

180
00:15:32,595 --> 00:15:35,496
We, you and I,

181
00:15:35,565 --> 00:15:39,626
are merely puppets in a master plan...
no more, no less.

182
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,004
You've suffered enough.

183
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:46,667
Now you should enjoy
your life.

184
00:15:46,743 --> 00:15:49,177
Let me show you something.

185
00:15:51,614 --> 00:15:55,072
That's my wife and daughters.

186
00:15:55,151 --> 00:15:57,881
We live just down the street.

187
00:15:57,954 --> 00:16:01,481
I hope you visit us
for dinner.

188
00:16:24,447 --> 00:16:28,474
Oh. Oh, hey, buddy.
That's okay.

189
00:16:28,551 --> 00:16:31,714
You can build it again.
Just start again.

190
00:16:31,788 --> 00:16:33,722
Okay?

191
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:46,865
Who's there?

192
00:16:48,738 --> 00:16:52,572
- Who are you?
- Hundreds of little joys...

193
00:16:52,642 --> 00:16:55,440
to open a door and have
a woman beckon you in.

194
00:16:55,511 --> 00:16:59,413
To have her make a fire
and lay the table for you.

195
00:16:59,482 --> 00:17:02,042
And when it's late,

196
00:17:02,118 --> 00:17:04,712
to feel her take you
into her arms.

197
00:17:36,952 --> 00:17:39,853
This is Tina
Mulder. I'm not in to take your call.

198
00:17:39,922 --> 00:17:41,947
- Please leave your message.

199
00:17:42,024 --> 00:17:44,822
This is Dana Scully.

200
00:17:44,893 --> 00:17:50,263
Thank you. As before, you can reach
me at your son's office at the F.B.I.

201
00:17:50,332 --> 00:17:52,596
Thank you.

202
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,423
- Skinner.

203
00:18:54,496 --> 00:18:56,396
Sir, did you send me
this book?

204
00:18:56,465 --> 00:18:58,490
- Excuse me?
- This book?

205
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:02,094
It explains everything
that I found in Africa,

206
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,730
using the same symbols
that I found on the ship.

207
00:19:04,806 --> 00:19:07,502
Agent Scully, I asked you
not to involve me in this.

208
00:19:07,576 --> 00:19:11,774
It's all here, sir.
A foretelling of mass extinction.

209
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:16,011
A myth about a man who can save us
from it. That's why they took Mulder.

210
00:19:16,084 --> 00:19:19,383
They think that his illness
is a gift...

211
00:19:19,454 --> 00:19:21,445
a protection against
a coming plague.

212
00:19:30,098 --> 00:19:33,090
I'm sorry, Agent Scully. The assistant
director has given me express orders...

213
00:19:33,168 --> 00:19:35,762
- Not to let you in.

214
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,904
Sir, are you hurt?

215
00:19:42,978 --> 00:19:45,879
Are you cut?
Get on the phone.

216
00:19:49,885 --> 00:19:51,944
Hey!

217
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,113
Stop that man!

218
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:31,825
Good morning.

219
00:20:33,528 --> 00:20:35,621
- What's wrong, Fox?

220
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:39,360
There's nothing wrong.
Perfect.

221
00:20:39,434 --> 00:20:42,460
It's all perfect.
What the hell am I doing here?

222
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:45,870
- You just need some coffee.
- No, I'm... I'm serious.

223
00:20:45,941 --> 00:20:49,274
I have commitments to the X-Files,
to Scully, to my sister.

224
00:20:50,946 --> 00:20:54,040
You think you know
what that means... commitment.

225
00:20:54,116 --> 00:20:56,607
- It's all just childish, Fox.
- Childish?

226
00:20:56,685 --> 00:20:59,711
Yes. You've been a child...

227
00:20:59,788 --> 00:21:01,949
with only the responsibility
of a child,

228
00:21:02,023 --> 00:21:04,116
to your own dreams
and fantasies.

229
00:21:04,192 --> 00:21:08,686
But you won't know the true joy
of responsibility until you
plant your feet in the world...

230
00:21:11,867 --> 00:21:14,267
and become a father.

231
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:20,772
Wow.

232
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:26,276
Diana, you... you lay all this on
me after I sleep with you one time.

233
00:21:26,346 --> 00:21:28,371
What's it gonna be like
tomorrow?

234
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,474
- You have to let go, Fox.
- Just like that?

235
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:35,180
I'm just supposed to slip
into domestic bliss even after
I was dropped here by a man...

236
00:21:35,255 --> 00:21:38,156
I have every reason to believe
left here to carry on his dirty work?

237
00:21:38,224 --> 00:21:41,387
Hey. He lives
the next block over.

238
00:21:43,463 --> 00:21:46,227
We'll go visit
after breakfast.

239
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,541
You told someone, didn't you?
You let the information out.

240
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:01,068
- What are you talking about?
- A man attacked Skinner in his office.

241
00:22:01,147 --> 00:22:03,741
- For what?
- For what he knows about Mulder.

242
00:22:06,252 --> 00:22:08,186
I haven't told anyone.

243
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:22,592
What is this?

244
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:24,534
These are mine!

245
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:26,936
You've hacked into my files.
What are you doing with these?

246
00:22:27,006 --> 00:22:29,099
- I was having them analyzed.
- By whom?

247
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:32,542
- The National Institute of Health.
- What?

248
00:22:32,612 --> 00:22:36,946
The material you have there,
encrypted data that describes
advanced human genetics,

249
00:22:37,016 --> 00:22:39,041
where did you get it?

250
00:22:39,118 --> 00:22:41,109
This was not supposed
to go public.

251
00:22:41,187 --> 00:22:43,121
- Wherever you got it,

252
00:22:43,189 --> 00:22:45,589
that data supports
what's happened to Mulder.

253
00:22:45,658 --> 00:22:49,389
It proves what he's become...
biologically alien.

254
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:55,461
- What are you hiding?
- It doesn't matter.

255
00:22:55,535 --> 00:22:58,060
It matters to someone.

256
00:22:58,137 --> 00:23:01,402
Whoever it is, it sounds
like they're looking for Mulder too.

257
00:23:15,989 --> 00:23:18,014
I wasn't expecting you
so soon.

258
00:23:18,091 --> 00:23:20,491
I thought you'd take
a few days to settle in.

259
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:25,497
I think you need to allay
his unhappiness with things
he perceives as left undone.

260
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,267
Including why you live
in a bigger house than I do.

261
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,600
I've got quite
a few mouths to feed.

262
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:34,799
Three grandkids...

263
00:23:34,874 --> 00:23:37,604
and, uh, your sister.

264
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:45,642
She's been living here
all along.

265
00:23:45,718 --> 00:23:47,652
Living a life you'd forsaken.

266
00:23:59,432 --> 00:24:02,629
He said you were coming.

267
00:24:02,702 --> 00:24:05,728
A father has high hopes
for his son.

268
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:09,798
But he never dreams his boy's
gonna change the world.
I'm so proud of this man.

269
00:24:09,876 --> 00:24:12,538
The depth of his capacity
for suffering.

270
00:24:12,612 --> 00:24:14,637
Like father, like son.

271
00:24:16,816 --> 00:24:19,046
They think what he has
is killing him,

272
00:24:19,118 --> 00:24:22,781
but in actuality,
he's never been more alive.

273
00:24:24,157 --> 00:24:27,752
- Do you think he dreams?
- Oh, I'm sure he dreams.

274
00:24:27,827 --> 00:24:32,764
- About what I wonder.
- The dreams all men who
are owned by the world have...

275
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,834
a simpler life...

276
00:24:35,902 --> 00:24:38,234
full of small pleasures.

277
00:24:38,304 --> 00:24:43,071
Extraordinary men are always most
tempted by the most ordinary things.

278
00:24:44,644 --> 00:24:47,010
Dreams are all he has now.

279
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,360
- Bum a cigarette, Agent Fowley?
- I don't smoke.

280
00:25:07,432 --> 00:25:11,630
Really? I could swear
I smell cigarette smoke on you.

281
00:25:13,205 --> 00:25:16,231
- Let's cut the crap, shall we?
- Yes. Let's.

282
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:24,081
Where's Mulder?

283
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:27,880
Maybe before you go around
blaming everyone you can find
for what's happened to Mulder,

284
00:25:27,953 --> 00:25:31,389
you could think about
what you could have done to prevent it.

285
00:25:31,456 --> 00:25:34,550
I just want you to think...

286
00:25:34,626 --> 00:25:36,753
think of Mulder
when you met him,

287
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:40,764
think of the promise and
the life in front of him.

288
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:43,995
Think of him now.

289
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:48,005
And then try and stand there
in front of me, look me in the eye...

290
00:25:48,073 --> 00:25:51,440
and tell me Mulder wouldn't
bust his ass trying to save you.

291
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,035
I'm thinking, Agent Scully.

292
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:58,240
I'm always thinking.

293
00:26:05,457 --> 00:26:07,550
It's a chance none of us
ever expected,

294
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:09,821
let alone hope for.

295
00:26:09,895 --> 00:26:13,888
After all these years, trying to develop
a compatible alien human hybrid,

296
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:15,900
to have one ready-made.

297
00:26:15,968 --> 00:26:19,199
All these years,
all the questioning why.

298
00:26:19,271 --> 00:26:23,867
Why keep Mulder alive
when it was so simple to remove
the threat that he posed?

299
00:26:23,942 --> 00:26:26,775
There was no way you could
have predicted this.

300
00:26:26,845 --> 00:26:30,337
The fact remains,
he's become our savior.

301
00:26:30,415 --> 00:26:34,317
He's immune to the coming
viral apocalypse. He's the hero here.

302
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:37,287
He may not survive
the procedure.

303
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:42,253
Then he suffers
a hero's fate.

304
00:26:54,172 --> 00:26:56,640
Diana?

305
00:27:00,512 --> 00:27:02,275
Fox.

306
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:07,351
It's time, honey.

307
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,921
How you doin'?

308
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:45,355
Don't think of the man.

309
00:27:45,424 --> 00:27:50,428
Think of the sacrifice he's making
for all of us... for the world.

310
00:27:50,561 --> 00:27:53,496
It would have been nice
to give him a choice.

311
00:27:55,099 --> 00:27:58,262
You don't think Mulder
would have chosen this?

312
00:27:58,335 --> 00:28:00,633
To become the thing
he sought for so long?

313
00:28:00,704 --> 00:28:04,003
To feel what it's like?

314
00:28:04,074 --> 00:28:06,008
He is what he sought.

315
00:28:06,076 --> 00:28:08,044
We'll never know.

316
00:28:08,112 --> 00:28:10,478
Besides, his task
is almost complete.

317
00:28:12,116 --> 00:28:14,983
I'll carry the burden
from here on in.

318
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,296
I know about the boy.

319
00:28:32,303 --> 00:28:34,237
The boy on the beach.

320
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,170
The vision you go to
in your mind.

321
00:28:40,411 --> 00:28:42,879
We all have such places...

322
00:28:42,947 --> 00:28:45,006
a point of memory and desire.

323
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:49,712
I've seen him
thousands of times.

324
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:54,183
I've never seen
what he wants me to see.

325
00:28:54,258 --> 00:28:56,351
Close your eyes.

326
00:28:56,427 --> 00:28:59,055
He's ready to show you,
if you're ready to see.

327
00:29:15,446 --> 00:29:18,313
Wow!
What did you make?

328
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:20,475
An unidentified flying object.

329
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:24,317
Hey, what are you doing?
Why are you destroying your spaceship?

330
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:27,619
It's your spaceship.
You're destroying it.

331
00:29:27,691 --> 00:29:30,091
You were supposed to help me.

332
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:41,060
- You're running out of time.

333
00:29:41,138 --> 00:29:43,436
Why do you come to me
like this?

334
00:29:43,507 --> 00:29:46,806
Why, when I can't find him?

335
00:29:46,877 --> 00:29:48,936
You don't look in
the right place.

336
00:29:49,013 --> 00:29:52,744
- I don't think you're hearing me.
- You don't know where he is?

337
00:29:52,816 --> 00:29:57,014
Even if I did,
I wouldn't know how to save him.
This science makes no sense to me.

338
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,817
Have you looked for him...

339
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,824
here?

340
00:30:04,995 --> 00:30:07,623
Are you asking me to pray?

341
00:30:16,006 --> 00:30:20,033
There are more worlds than the one
you can hold in your hand.

342
00:30:29,887 --> 00:30:32,788
I hope you see
the poetry in this, Diana.

343
00:30:32,856 --> 00:30:35,518
You're removing genetic material
that may kill your son.

344
00:30:35,593 --> 00:30:39,529
We're forcing the next step
in evolution to save man.

345
00:30:39,597 --> 00:30:42,157
We're doing God's work, Diana.

346
00:30:42,232 --> 00:30:45,167
Without this immunity,
everyone would die.

347
00:30:45,235 --> 00:30:48,068
This knowledge
is God's blessing.

348
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:51,164
I'll carry on
for Mulder from here.

349
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,461
The patient's come out.
Mulder's awake.

350
00:31:16,532 --> 00:31:20,491
We've got him topped off, but he
won't stay under. I don't think
we can take him any further.

351
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:23,368
-  Is he feeling any pain?
-  Flat on the monitor.

352
00:31:23,439 --> 00:31:26,465
- Any flatter,
he'd be circling the drain.
-  Okay.

353
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:29,409
Let's do this thing.

354
00:31:58,808 --> 00:32:00,969
Rest now.

355
00:32:04,947 --> 00:32:06,972
Can you open the blind?

356
00:32:08,117 --> 00:32:10,381
I'd like to take
a look outside.

357
00:32:11,821 --> 00:32:14,153
I wanted you to have peace.

358
00:32:15,525 --> 00:32:17,459
Where's Samantha?

359
00:32:17,527 --> 00:32:20,223
Your sister died
five years ago.

360
00:32:30,306 --> 00:32:32,240
What about Deep Throat?

361
00:32:33,342 --> 00:32:36,004
We've been over this.
He's dead.

362
00:32:38,281 --> 00:32:40,215
Diana's dead.

363
00:32:41,551 --> 00:32:43,485
And Scully.

364
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,688
Scully's dead?

365
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,156
She's dead.

366
00:32:53,563 --> 00:32:55,588
It's time for you
to let go.

367
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,001
They're waiting for you,
if you let go.

368
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,543
Close your eyes, Fox.

369
00:33:20,756 --> 00:33:24,192
We're the last, you and I.

370
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,194
The end...

371
00:33:27,497 --> 00:33:29,431
and the beginning.

372
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,604
There's nothing to be done.

373
00:33:40,676 --> 00:33:43,304
Nothing at all.

374
00:35:58,314 --> 00:36:02,114
Scully. I knew you'd come.

375
00:36:07,156 --> 00:36:09,590
They told me you were dead.

376
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:11,456
And you believed them?

377
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,397
- Traitor.
- What?

378
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:20,834
- Deserter. Coward.
- Scully, don't.

379
00:36:20,903 --> 00:36:26,239
- I'm dying.
- You're not supposed
to die, Mulder. Not here.

380
00:36:26,308 --> 00:36:28,674
What do you mean?

381
00:36:28,744 --> 00:36:31,611
Not in a comfortable bed
with the devil outside.

382
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:34,775
No, you don't understand.
He's taken care of me.

383
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,977
No, Mulder.

384
00:36:37,053 --> 00:36:39,681
He's lulled you to sleep.

385
00:36:39,755 --> 00:36:43,714
He's made you trade your true mission
for creature comforts.

386
00:36:43,793 --> 00:36:45,988
There was no mission.

387
00:36:47,463 --> 00:36:50,626
- There were no aliens.
- No aliens?

388
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,861
Have you looked outside,
Mulder?

389
00:36:57,106 --> 00:36:59,040
I can't.

390
00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:02,877
I'm... too tired.

391
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:06,912
No, Mulder.
You must get up.

392
00:37:06,981 --> 00:37:10,007
You must get up and fight.

393
00:37:10,084 --> 00:37:12,348
Especially you.

394
00:37:12,419 --> 00:37:14,819
This isn't your place.

395
00:37:14,889 --> 00:37:16,823
Get up, Mulder.

396
00:37:16,891 --> 00:37:19,689
Get up and fight the fight.

397
00:37:24,031 --> 00:37:25,965
- Scully?

398
00:37:27,401 --> 00:37:29,335
Scully?

399
00:37:31,438 --> 00:37:33,372
Scully?

400
00:37:36,744 --> 00:37:38,678
Scully?

401
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,364
Mulder?

402
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:01,894
Mulder, you've got to wake up.

403
00:38:03,704 --> 00:38:06,195
I've got to get you
out of here.

404
00:38:07,675 --> 00:38:11,076
- Mulder, can you understand me?

405
00:38:17,952 --> 00:38:20,386
Mulder, you've got to get up.

406
00:38:20,454 --> 00:38:23,548
I don't know
how much time we have.

407
00:38:23,624 --> 00:38:27,890
- You've got to get up, Mulder.

408
00:38:27,962 --> 00:38:30,362
No one can do it
but you, Mulder.

409
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:35,101
Mulder, help me.

410
00:38:37,771 --> 00:38:40,638
Please, Mulder.

411
00:38:54,355 --> 00:38:58,291
You... help me.

412
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:17,901
Scully, what are you doing here?
Actually, I was just
getting dressed to come see you,

413
00:39:17,978 --> 00:39:21,744
but I couldn't find a tie
to go with my victory cap.

414
00:39:21,815 --> 00:39:24,409
Mulder, no work.
You have to go back to bed.

415
00:39:24,485 --> 00:39:27,249
Oh, wait.
Tie goes to the runner.

416
00:39:28,522 --> 00:39:31,923
Scully, I, uh...

417
00:39:31,992 --> 00:39:35,325
I was comin' down to work
to tell you...

418
00:39:35,396 --> 00:39:37,330
that Albert Hosteen is dead.

419
00:39:38,899 --> 00:39:41,026
He died last night
in New Mexico.

420
00:39:41,101 --> 00:39:45,265
He'd been in a coma for two weeks.
There was no way he could've been
in your apartment.

421
00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:47,864
He was there.
We... We prayed together.

422
00:39:50,544 --> 00:39:54,503
Mulder, I don't believe that.
I... I don't believe it. It's impossible.

423
00:39:54,581 --> 00:39:59,780
Is it any more impossible than what you
saw in Africa or what you saw in me?

424
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,154
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

425
00:40:11,865 --> 00:40:15,494
Mulder, I was so determined
to find a cure to save you...

426
00:40:15,569 --> 00:40:18,732
that I could deny
what it was that I saw.

427
00:40:18,806 --> 00:40:21,673
And now I don't even know.
I don't know...

428
00:40:21,742 --> 00:40:24,302
I don't know what the truth is,
I don't know who to listen to,

429
00:40:24,378 --> 00:40:27,404
I don't know
who to trust.

430
00:40:32,853 --> 00:40:35,515
Diana Fowley was found
murdered this morning.

431
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,554
I never trusted her.

432
00:40:42,863 --> 00:40:46,424
But she helped save your life
just as much as I did.

433
00:40:50,104 --> 00:40:52,299
She gave me that book.

434
00:40:54,141 --> 00:40:56,234
It was her key
that led me to you.

435
00:40:57,544 --> 00:41:01,947
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

436
00:41:02,015 --> 00:41:04,040
I know she was your friend.

437
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:13,121
Scully, I was like you once.
I didn't know who to trust and I...

438
00:41:13,193 --> 00:41:16,526
I chose another path,

439
00:41:16,597 --> 00:41:20,863
another life, another fate
where I found my sister.

440
00:41:22,703 --> 00:41:27,197
And even though my world
was unrecognizable and upside down,

441
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:31,934
there was one thing
that remained the same.

442
00:41:34,014 --> 00:41:36,949
You were my friend...

443
00:41:37,017 --> 00:41:39,144
and you told me the truth.

444
00:41:42,289 --> 00:41:47,124
Even when the world was falling apart,
you were my constant,

445
00:41:47,194 --> 00:41:49,162
my touchstone.

446
00:41:51,832 --> 00:41:54,130
And you are mine.

447
00:42:42,416 --> 00:42:44,509
Ah!
