shoulder the responsibility...

for not only their own existence,

111
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:45,503
but their country's,
and the world's, as well.

112
00:07:46,846 --> 00:07:49,144
Your father, Captain,

113
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:52,548
believed his country should look
to another form of government,

114
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:55,850
and he took control of that belief.

115
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:58,789
So, in that respect,

116
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:01,122
we view him
as an extraordinary man.

117
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:04,463
And we believe--

that it runs in the family.

classified "compartmentalized."

accept this assignment...

Mr. Hunt, sir,

150
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,299
uh, I've heard about
those reports and...

151
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:22,425
they are no doubt correct.

152
00:10:22,535 --> 00:10:24,671
You'll have a good view
of the president today.

153
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:29,808
Well, I-I like the president's family.
They're interesting people.

154
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:33,607
However, I have my own views
on the president's national policy.

155
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,148
I'll probably just eat lunch.

156
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:38,843
I'm going to the movies
at the Texas Theater.

157
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:41,478
It's only 90 cents.

158
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:43,545
I love the movies.

159
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:48,893
I brought the curtain rods, Lee.

160
00:10:58,671 --> 00:11:02,107
I bought curtain rods just like this
from a mail order back in March.

161
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:05,736

162
00:11:05,812 --> 00:11:08,076

164
00:11:10,216 --> 00:11:12,548
Yes, we do.

165
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:14,882
Speaking of which, Lee,
I've informed our fellow defender...

166
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:17,184
that you will hide the curtain rods
on the sixth floor...

167
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,454
of the book depository, behind
the cartons against the back wall.

168
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:23,586
The Cuban visa?

169
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:25,527
Once I've been notified
the curtain rods...

170
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:27,657
have been safely removed
from the depository,

171
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:30,862
the visa and the money
for your trip will be in your room.

172
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:34,532
Take a bus.

173
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:36,541

Not so much because
he believes in his actions,

but because he believes these actions
are all which life allows him.
