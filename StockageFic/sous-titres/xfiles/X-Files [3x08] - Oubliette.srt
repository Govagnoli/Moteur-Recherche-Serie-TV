1
00:00:05,044 --> 00:00:05,760
Name, please?

2
00:00:05,783 --> 00:00:09,005
- Uh, Amy Jacobs.
- Okay, Amy. Fill out your address card.

3
00:00:09,097 --> 00:00:11,167
And may I have
the next one in line?

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,894
Carl, I need a reload.

5
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:25,175
Hey, Carl. Hey!
I need more film.

6
00:00:25,285 --> 00:00:27,336
I haven't loaded it yet.

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,071
Why do you even bother coming in
if you’re not gonna do your job?

8
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:39,025
Nobody's gonna spoil us.

9
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:46,463
Amy? Amy! Mom!

10
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:54,164
Hurry up with those drinks, Lucy.
We're backin' up!

11
00:02:59,571 --> 00:03:03,924
What are you doing? These are regular.
They all ordered large.

12
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:10,919
What-- What happened?

13
00:03:24,024 --> 00:03:25,746
Nobody's gonna-- gonna spoil us.

14
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:31,977
Nobody's gonna spoil us.
Nobody's gonna spoil... us.

15
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,924
Nobody's gonna--
Nobody's gonna spoil us.

16
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,389
Nobody's gonna spoil--

17
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:41,810
Nobody's gonna spoil--

18
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:45,615
Nobody's gonna spoil us.

19
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,006
[Man]
Bushes, please. Flowers. Everything.

20
00:05:00,827 --> 00:05:02,168
I'm looking for the agent in charge.

21
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:04,774
- And you are?
- Special Agent Mulder.

22
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:07,145
I'll let him know you’re here.

23
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,116
[Man]Can we get some shots
right here along these draperies?

24
00:05:35,324 --> 00:05:37,752
Mrs. Jacobs?

25
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:41,053
I'm Fox Mulder.
I'm with the FBI.

26
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:43,469
I'm sorry about your daughter.

27
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,354
It's her birthday on Tuesday.

28
00:05:46,453 --> 00:05:48,433
We're gonna do everything
we can to find her.

29
00:05:48,483 --> 00:05:51,424
Who could do such a thing?

30
00:05:51,497 --> 00:05:55,038
Who can take somebody
who wasn't theirs?

31
00:05:55,118 --> 00:05:58,928
- I know you must be feeling--
- I'm sorry,

32
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:03,209
but how could you really
know how I feel?

33
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:29,291
It's blood.
Amy had a nosebleed.

34
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:31,661
Her little sister said
it happened when the kidnapper...

35
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:33,862
put his hand over her mouth.

36
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:35,690
We're running it anyway.

37
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:37,622
Walt Eubanks, special agent in charge.

38
00:06:37,727 --> 00:06:39,758
Fox Mulder.
Any leads on a suspect?

39
00:06:39,863 --> 00:06:41,492
A vague description
from the sister.

40
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:44,574
Hair and fiber pulled some promising
bits, but he didn't leave any prints.

41
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:46,927
Here or in the flower beds out front.

42
00:06:46,997 --> 00:06:50,767
- What about the neighbors?
- Nobody saw anything.
Not a car. Nothing.

43
00:06:50,842 --> 00:06:53,554
It was someone who knew her.
That much we can figure.

44
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,052
He knew right where he was going.

45
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:58,089
No, I'd bet that he didn't
know her so well, or else
he wouldn't have been so bold.

46
00:06:58,163 --> 00:07:00,284
Either way, we're pretty much
chasing our tails...

47
00:07:00,364 --> 00:07:02,491
until something or someone
turns on this.

48
00:07:02,582 --> 00:07:04,521
What about this woman
at the fast-food restaurant?

49
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,500
- You heard about that?
- Yeah, that's why I came down here.

50
00:07:06,603 --> 00:07:09,627
- Seems like a pretty thin lead.
- Mind if I talk to her?

51
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,941
[ Scoffs ]
Hey! Save me the time.

52
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:14,372
Great. Thanks.

53
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:19,587
Mulder.

54
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:20,902
Thought you missed your flight.

55
00:07:20,948 --> 00:07:23,390
We were delayed in D.C.
I tried you on your cell phone--

56
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,427
Oh, I forgot it.
I left in kind of a hurry.

57
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:27,950
- Your message said something
about a kidnapping?
- Yeah. Fifteen-year-old girl...

58
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:30,613
named Amy Jacobs was taken
from her bedroom last night.

59
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:32,321
- 10:00.
- Is she here?

60
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:34,662
- No, they haven't found her.
- Well, what are we doing here?

61
00:07:34,742 --> 00:07:36,395
A 30-year-old woman
named Lucy Householder...

62
00:07:36,452 --> 00:07:38,715
was admitted here
shortly after 10:00.

63
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,039
She collapsed at work, suffering
from some kind of seizure...

64
00:07:41,136 --> 00:07:43,405
and what her doctors
are calling "glossolalia."

65
00:07:43,474 --> 00:07:45,876
- Incoherent speech.
- Technically, but whether
she knew it or not,

66
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:49,010
she was repeating the exact words
spoken by Amy’s abductor...

67
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:51,312
at the exact same time,
20 miles across town.

68
00:07:51,364 --> 00:07:54,494
- That's spooky.
- That's my name, isn't it?

69
00:07:54,584 --> 00:07:58,044
Turns out Lucy Householder
knows a little something
about kidnapping herself.

70
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:01,693
When she was eight years old,
she was taken from her bedroom
while her parents were asleep.

71
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,242
She was missing for five years
until she escaped and someone
found her by the side of a road.

72
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:09,834
Apparently, her abductor had
kept her locked in a basement
the entire time.

73
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:13,299
- They never caught him.

74
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,495
I'm Fox Mulder. This is Dana Scully.
We're with the FBI.

75
00:08:37,572 --> 00:08:40,297
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

76
00:08:40,415 --> 00:08:41,826
I'd like a cigarette.

77
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,702
They won’t let me smoke in here.

78
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:48,440
- Are you feeling any better?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I’d just like a cigarette.

79
00:08:48,518 --> 00:08:52,375
A young girl was kidnapped last night.
Have you heard anything about that?

80
00:08:52,437 --> 00:08:54,238
What are you asking me for?

81
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:57,172
Do you remember what
you were saying last night
when you collapsed at work?

82
00:08:57,248 --> 00:09:00,991
- What?
- You were saying,
"Nobody’s going to spoil us. "

83
00:09:04,155 --> 00:09:07,461
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.

84
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,946
Can you think of any reason
why you might have said it?

85
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,911
- What'd I just say?
- Those were the exact words...

86
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,629
spoken by the kidnapper to
the little girl when he took her.

87
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,479
So you can see
that under the circumstances
it might seem strange--

88
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,128
So what's your point?

89
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:29,046
All of us kidnap victims
gotta stick together?

90
00:09:29,128 --> 00:09:32,343
No. We just want to find
the little girl anyway we can,

91
00:09:32,413 --> 00:09:33,661
and if you know anything--

92
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:42,270
Look, what I been through in my life
I wouldn't want to wish on anybody.

93
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,724
Doesn't mean I can make it
any better for me or anyone else.

94
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:51,007
All right. Well, thanks
for talking to us, Lucy.

95
00:09:51,071 --> 00:09:54,992
Yeah.

96
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,405
Hey.

97
00:09:58,488 --> 00:10:03,110
- When do I get out of here?
- As soon as your doctors feel
it's okay for you to go.

98
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:06,301
- No, they say it's up to you.
- No.

99
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:08,945
We can't hold you here.
You're free to go.

100
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:16,288
I guess she's not too big
on confined spaces.

101
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,117
Yeah.

102
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:00,691
- You're the one that called for a tow?
- No, not me.

103
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,529
- Gary Mosier?
- No, uh, wrong guy.

104
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,317
[ Sighs ] While I'm out here,
I might as well give you a hand.

105
00:11:07,372 --> 00:11:09,132
It's okay.
We'll be fine.

106
00:11:10,995 --> 00:11:13,210
Think it looks like
you're in a world of hurt.

107
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:15,004
Blown sidewall.
You're gonna need a new tire.

108
00:11:15,062 --> 00:11:18,474
- Yeah, yeah. It looks that way.
- Got a spare in the trunk?

109
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:21,290
- Yeah.
- Twenty bucks cash.
My boss don't got to know about it.

110
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,352
- Have you on the road in five minutes.
- I can't pay you.

111
00:11:23,424 --> 00:11:27,001
Make it ten. Pop your trunk.
Take me five minutes, max.

112
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:31,270
- Leave me alone!
- Hey, man.
What the hell's your problem?

113
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,579
Leave me alone!
Get out of here!

114
00:11:34,688 --> 00:11:36,981
Lunatic!

115
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,255
Freak!

116
00:12:00,424 --> 00:12:02,141
Agent Mulder.
Lucy Householder.

117
00:12:02,203 --> 00:12:03,950
- You get anywhere on that?
- I'm workin' on it.

118
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:06,410
Got one of my guys on the line.
Says she's got a criminal record.

119
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:08,223
Prostitution, narcotics convictions--

120
00:12:08,285 --> 00:12:10,770
- She's done some time.
- That doesn't surprise me,
given her history.

121
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,541
She's also got a boyfriend doing time
for assault and child endangerment.

122
00:12:13,618 --> 00:12:16,783
Used to live with him up in the hills.
Pretty sketchy characters.

123
00:12:16,856 --> 00:12:19,992
- I don't think she's involved.
- Closest thing I got to a lead.

124
00:12:20,062 --> 00:12:21,200
I can tell him to shift some men--

125
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,129
No, let me follow up
on that, okay? Thanks.

126
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:28,555
- Mulder. Got something.
Something weird.
- What?

127
00:12:28,621 --> 00:12:31,935
I was going over Lucy Householder's
medical workup, and something hit me.

128
00:12:32,003 --> 00:12:35,551
- Her blood type is "O" positive.
- Yeah?

129
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:38,438
Forensics lifted two blood types
off of her work clothes:

130
00:12:38,502 --> 00:12:40,444
"O" positive and "B" positive.

131
00:12:40,504 --> 00:12:42,706
Two guesses as to what
Amy Jacobs' blood type is.

132
00:12:42,784 --> 00:12:45,095
How could it be Amy Jacobs' blood?
Lucy was all the way across town.

133
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,054
I don't know, Mulder,
but it begs the question.

134
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,371
Because it matches the victim's
blood type? How many have
"B" positive blood, Scully?

135
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:54,739
One in five? That's hundreds
of thousands of people
in the local population alone.

136
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,620
We're not talking about
the local population.

137
00:12:56,684 --> 00:13:00,421
We're talking about a woman
who's tied to this case, who had
somebody else's blood on her.

138
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:03,087
Lucy is a victim, Scully.
just like Amy Jacobs.

139
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:06,904
If she’s got any connection
to this case, that's the extent of it.

140
00:13:06,977 --> 00:13:09,818
- Well, we'll know soon enough.
- What are you talking about?

141
00:13:09,918 --> 00:13:13,276
I'm running a P.C.R. on her blood
to see if there’s a D.N.A. match.

142
00:13:13,345 --> 00:13:15,513
- Will you keep that under your hat?
- Why?

143
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,172
Because I don't want Lucy Householder
treated like a suspect in this case...

144
00:13:18,243 --> 00:13:20,588
until it's absolutely certain
that she is one, okay?

145
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:48,884
- Lucy?
- I'm cold.

146
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:51,268
- Brought you another blanket.

147
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,928
- We should call the doctor.
- No!

148
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:56,710
Let me see your face.

149
00:13:56,767 --> 00:14:01,087
- What did you do to yourself?
- It's dark. Why is it dark?

150
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:03,169
- I can't see.
- You hold on now.

151
00:14:03,248 --> 00:14:05,620
- I can't see!

152
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:44,537
Give your E.T.A., please.

153
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:47,863
Base, this is 17.
Our E. T.A. is five minutes.

154
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:49,801
- Over.

155
00:15:05,228 --> 00:15:08,554
- How's she doin'?
- Fine. Blood pressure's back to normal.

156
00:15:08,644 --> 00:15:10,263
- Temperature’s back up.

157
00:15:10,322 --> 00:15:12,717
She must have gone down
the rabbit hole for a while.

158
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:15,823
You should get something to eat soon.
Get your blood sugar back up.

159
00:15:19,729 --> 00:15:23,682
Well, what do you say, Lucy?
Can I take you to dinner?

160
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:35,239
- You feelin' better?
- Better than what?

161
00:15:36,756 --> 00:15:38,894
Better than Amy Jacobs.

162
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:41,277
Wouldn't know.

163
00:15:41,344 --> 00:15:43,230
If anybody knows, I say you do.

164
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:47,643
I got my own set
of problems now, thank you.

165
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:51,418
- How'd you scratch your face?
- Must have done it in my sleep.

166
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:58,160
- Are you using again, Lucy?
- I'm clean.

167
00:15:58,231 --> 00:16:02,374
Passed my test last week.
Ask Henry.

168
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:04,489
With flying colors.

169
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,792
Have you ever experienced
temporary blindness before?

170
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:16,323
I've probably experienced just about
everything once or twice.

171
00:16:16,386 --> 00:16:19,003
It's all been pretty temporary.

172
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:21,111
That girl's in trouble, Lucy.

173
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,156
And there's not a damn thing
I can do about it.

174
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:30,106
You understand?
I can't help you.

175
00:16:36,436 --> 00:16:38,779
I think you can, Lucy.

176
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:42,931
- How?
- Well, that's something
you have to tell me.

177
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:45,591
- What can I possibly do?
- Lead us to her.

178
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:49,327
I don't know where she is.

179
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,156
I don't care.
I'm not interested.

180
00:16:55,905 --> 00:17:00,189
That's too bad, Lucy, because right now
I think you’re her best hope.

181
00:17:02,602 --> 00:17:05,501
If I'm her "best hope,"
then that little girl...

182
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:08,917
is in a hell of a lot more trouble
than you think.

183
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:11,906
What do you want?

184
00:18:12,016 --> 00:18:14,024
Why are you doing this?

185
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:18,463
I want to go home!

186
00:18:28,063 --> 00:18:30,359
- Mulder, I've got--
- Scully, take a look at this.

187
00:18:37,186 --> 00:18:38,668
Is that Lucy?

188
00:18:38,721 --> 00:18:41,634
Yeah. It was taken in 1 978,
the week she was found.

189
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,658
She'd been held in the dark
for so long, her eyes were
hypersensitive to the light.

190
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,232
Whoever held her captive
wasn't very big on conversation either.

191
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:59,440
She's 13 years old here and can
barely string two words together.

192
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:02,073
It's amazing she's gotten
anywhere in life.

193
00:19:02,132 --> 00:19:06,768
Well, by most yardsticks,
she hasn't, Mulder.

194
00:19:06,873 --> 00:19:08,810
I think we’ve got a break in the case.

195
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:10,970
- A big one.
- What is it?

196
00:19:11,104 --> 00:19:14,902
School pictures were
mailed out this week to everyone
in Amy's class except Amy.

197
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:17,328
- One of Eubanks' men discovered it.
- Who's the photographer?

198
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:19,296
It's an outfit called
Larkin Scholastic.

199
00:19:19,362 --> 00:19:22,795
The photographer checked out,
but his assistant was fired
the day after the shoot.

200
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:25,453
- A man named Carl Wade.
- Well, what have you got on him?

201
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:29,413
DMV's an old address, but he spent
a good part of the past 15 years...

202
00:19:29,481 --> 00:19:32,085
institutionalized
for a bipolar condition.

203
00:19:32,152 --> 00:19:34,607
The only thing current
we have on him is this photo.

204
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:37,414
It was taken by his employer
trying out a new camera.

205
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,830
- Have you shown this picture
to Amy's little sister?
- They're doing it right now.

206
00:19:40,901 --> 00:19:43,226
I'm gonna take it
and show it to Lucy.

207
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:56,957
Lucy?

208
00:20:57,067 --> 00:20:59,092
- Lucy, wait.
- No, I'm done with you.

209
00:20:59,156 --> 00:21:01,958
I just want to ask you a question.

210
00:21:02,057 --> 00:21:03,288
Lucy, wait a second.

211
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:05,307
Don't... touch me.

212
00:21:07,694 --> 00:21:09,899
I don't like to be touched.

213
00:21:12,743 --> 00:21:14,928
I'm sorry.

214
00:21:24,024 --> 00:21:29,099
I was doin' okay until this, you know?

215
00:21:29,243 --> 00:21:31,085
Figures.

216
00:21:31,145 --> 00:21:35,140
I just want to show you
a photograph, okay?

217
00:21:41,331 --> 00:21:43,852
You recognize him, don’t you?

218
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:48,252
Lucy!

219
00:22:37,561 --> 00:22:39,450
Hey! Stop!

220
00:23:26,577 --> 00:23:28,907
Lucy?

221
00:23:31,455 --> 00:23:34,995
- Lucy?

222
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:39,638
What's happening to me?

223
00:23:52,258 --> 00:23:57,008
He's probably changed a lot
over the last 17 years.

224
00:23:57,077 --> 00:23:59,757
Did you even know his name?

225
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:06,009
Carl Wade.

226
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:08,601
He worked as a photographer's assistant.

227
00:24:08,651 --> 00:24:11,635
School pictures, mostly.
That's where he saw Amy Jacobs.

228
00:24:17,262 --> 00:24:19,023
So what do you want from me?

229
00:24:19,122 --> 00:24:21,427
I want you to tell me
what you’re going through.

230
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:25,649
It might feel good to tell somebody.

231
00:24:29,255 --> 00:24:32,344
I feel like it's happening
all over again.

232
00:24:32,434 --> 00:24:36,140
You can actually feel what
she's going through, can’t you?

233
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:44,392
I don't want to go
through this again.

234
00:24:44,475 --> 00:24:47,167
- Lucy, she needs your help.
- There's nothing I can do.

235
00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:51,762
- Lucy--

236
00:25:02,143 --> 00:25:04,257
Wait here a second, okay?

237
00:25:17,071 --> 00:25:18,353
- What's goin' on?
- We're here to arrest Lucy Householder.

238
00:25:18,421 --> 00:25:21,130
- Why?
- I think you know why, Agent Mulder.

239
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,337
What the hell is happening?

240
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:28,610
Mulder, the blood on Lucy's uniform
was an exact D.N.A. match.

241
00:25:28,682 --> 00:25:31,803
- Lucy was covered in Amy Jacobs' blood.
- She didn't do it, Scully.

242
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:34,226
Mulder, it's incontrovertible evidence.

243
00:25:34,296 --> 00:25:36,400
Agent Mulder!

244
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:44,144
- Where is she?
- She was just here.

245
00:25:44,221 --> 00:25:45,699
Well, she's gone now.

246
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:53,764
Please!

247
00:25:53,901 --> 00:25:56,029
I-I'm thirsty.

248
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,251
You shouldn't have run.

249
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:04,518
I was taking care of you.
I thought you understood that.

250
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:07,940
- Why did you run away?
- Please, mister.

251
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,763
I need some water!

252
00:26:12,676 --> 00:26:17,259
You shouldn't have run!

253
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:18,982
Please.

254
00:26:19,817 --> 00:26:21,787
I-I’m so thirsty.

255
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:51,121
I want my mom!

256
00:26:58,362 --> 00:27:01,158
I don't want to die here.

257
00:27:01,241 --> 00:27:05,878
Please? Please, mister.

258
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,623
- Don't let me die!

259
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:20,345
- You're gonna drive her away with this.
- She's been driven away, Mulder.

260
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:23,329
A half-dozen witnesses
placed her across town
at the time of the kidnapping.

261
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:27,079
- I'm well aware of the facts.
- Then trust me on this.
She's not working with Wade.

262
00:27:27,184 --> 00:27:31,266
How'd she get the blood on her?

263
00:27:31,418 --> 00:27:33,279
She may have bled it.

264
00:27:33,327 --> 00:27:36,015
She bled Amy Jacobs' blood?

265
00:27:36,081 --> 00:27:37,614
Yes, it may explain why
there was so little of it...

266
00:27:37,668 --> 00:27:40,894
- on the carpet in Amy's bedroom.
- Agent Eubanks?

267
00:27:40,981 --> 00:27:44,223
- Line three.
- I don't have time for
this nonsense, Agent Mulder.

268
00:27:44,285 --> 00:27:46,115
We've got a young girl's life at stake.

269
00:27:47,727 --> 00:27:51,993
I hate to say this, Mulder, but I think
you just ran out of credibility.

270
00:27:52,093 --> 00:27:53,679
He's wrong, Scully.

271
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,157
You're protecting her
beyond the point of reason.

272
00:27:56,225 --> 00:27:58,600
I'm protecting her because I think
she's connected to Amy Jacobs.

273
00:27:58,704 --> 00:28:00,360
just not the way everybody else
thinks she is.

274
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,428
Did you consider for one minute
that the person she's connected to
is Carl Wade?

275
00:28:03,499 --> 00:28:06,072
Carl Wade. Why would she be
connected with Carl Wade?

276
00:28:06,141 --> 00:28:09,184
For the same twisted reason that abused
children crave their parents' love...

277
00:28:09,257 --> 00:28:11,742
or hostages develop
sympathy for their captors.

278
00:28:11,812 --> 00:28:14,666
I mean, maybe Lucy developed
some kind of emotional dependency.

279
00:28:14,741 --> 00:28:18,329
After five years in a dark pit,
I'm sure she developed some kind
of connection with Wade.

280
00:28:18,402 --> 00:28:20,299
just not the kind
that you’re suggesting.

281
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:23,459
It makes more sense than the notion
that she's bleeding Amy Jacobs' blood.

282
00:28:23,518 --> 00:28:26,327
I don't how to explain it, but I think
that Wade's abduction of Amy...

283
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:29,920
triggered some kind of
physical response in Lucy.

284
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,252
- Some kind of empathic transference.
- Mulder, you can't--

285
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,815
That's how I account for
what Lucy's going through.

286
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:37,260
That's how I account for the identical
words that corresponded to Amy...

287
00:28:37,337 --> 00:28:39,554
and the spontaneous wounds
and blood as well.

288
00:28:39,616 --> 00:28:42,842
Then why did she run? If she's innocent,
what was she running from?

289
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:46,819
- Because she's afraid.
- You don't see what you’re doing,
do you, Mulder?

290
00:28:46,885 --> 00:28:50,036
- You are so close to this
that you just don't see it.
- What don't I see?

291
00:28:50,106 --> 00:28:54,379
The extreme rationalization.
Your personal identification
with the victim--

292
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,260
or, in this case, the suspect.

293
00:28:56,323 --> 00:28:58,942
You're becoming some kind of
an empath yourself, Mulder.

294
00:28:59,011 --> 00:29:01,935
You are so sympathetic to Lucy
as a victim--like your sister--

295
00:29:01,998 --> 00:29:05,387
that you can't see her as a person
who's capable of committing this crime.

296
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:07,536
You don't think
I've thought of that? I have.

297
00:29:07,614 --> 00:29:10,474
Not everything I do and say and think
or feel goes back to my sister.

298
00:29:10,543 --> 00:29:12,636
You, of all people, should realize
that sometimes...

299
00:29:12,702 --> 00:29:15,212
motivations for behavior can be
more complex and mysterious...

300
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:18,147
than tracing them back
to one single childhood experience.

301
00:29:18,227 --> 00:29:20,805
Agent Mulder!

302
00:29:20,862 --> 00:29:23,734
We've got a man on the way in
who spotted Wade.

303
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:33,553
Yeah, that's the guy.
I offered to fix his flat.

304
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:36,186
Tried to do the guy a favor.
He went wacko on me.

305
00:29:36,263 --> 00:29:38,277
Started freakin' the minute
I got out of my truck.

306
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,532
What about the girl?
Was she with him?

307
00:29:40,606 --> 00:29:43,116
I didn't see anyone else.

308
00:29:43,202 --> 00:29:46,056
- She could have been in the trunk.
- Can you give us an exact spot?

309
00:29:46,122 --> 00:29:48,406
Yeah.

310
00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:57,082
Right in the middle of nowhere.

311
00:29:57,165 --> 00:29:59,582
- Which way was the car headed?
- West.

312
00:30:01,381 --> 00:30:04,226
Interstate 12, County 15, north.

313
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:08,857
903. Look at this. Right off the 903.

314
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,622
- Easton?
- That's where Lucy was found
17 years ago.

315
00:30:39,002 --> 00:30:42,860
It's a small town, Scully.
Somebody's bound to know
Wade's face, where he lives.

316
00:30:42,933 --> 00:30:44,743
But we already stick out
like a sore thumb, Mulder.

317
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:48,100
If we start canvassing Main Street,
somebody's gonna pick up the phone.

318
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:50,827
But he's a photographer, right?

319
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:54,872
- Yeah.
- He should have an account here.

320
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:37,054
Go.

321
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,631
Amy?

322
00:32:26,884 --> 00:32:29,536
- Mulder?
- Yeah?

323
00:32:29,598 --> 00:32:31,508
What's happening?
Did you find her?

324
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,821
Where are they, Lucy?

325
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,423
Tell us where Wade took Amy.

326
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:12,534
I don't know.

327
00:33:12,607 --> 00:33:15,935
Anything happens to that girl, Lucy,
and you'll be tried as an accomplice.

328
00:33:19,186 --> 00:33:22,275
- Were they here when you arrived?
- No.

329
00:33:22,351 --> 00:33:24,767
- You haven't seen him?
Spoken with him?
- I said no!

330
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:28,277
- Then why are you here?
- I don't know.

331
00:33:28,351 --> 00:33:33,016
just showed up for no reason
in particular? That's what
you ask us to believe?

332
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:34,892
I've been here before.

333
00:33:36,496 --> 00:33:38,836
A long time ago.

334
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:41,151
It was where he kept me.

335
00:33:41,226 --> 00:33:44,105
So, why are you here now?

336
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:50,085
Take her outside
and place her in custody.

337
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:54,283
No. I'll take her.
Come on, Lucy.

338
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:56,538
- Agent Mulder--
- It's all right.

339
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,287
He hasn't touched her. Not yet.

340
00:34:24,574 --> 00:34:26,698
He wants to, but he can't.

341
00:34:26,766 --> 00:34:29,162
That's why he takes the pictures.

342
00:34:29,243 --> 00:34:32,628
What else, Lucy?
Tell me what else.

343
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,165
If he can't have her all to himself,

344
00:34:38,229 --> 00:34:41,138
that's when he's dangerous.

345
00:34:41,265 --> 00:34:43,422
That's when he'll start hurting her.

346
00:34:43,507 --> 00:34:45,212
- Lucy, you came here to help her.
- No!

347
00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:48,038
Why else would you come back here,
if not for Amy?

348
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:51,031
- You're sharing her pain.
- I can't.

349
00:34:51,102 --> 00:34:53,360
You're the survivor.
You're the strong one.

350
00:34:53,428 --> 00:34:55,238
Now Amy needs some of your strength.

351
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:00,406
- She's not gonna make it.
- She has to make it.

352
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:04,036
And you have to help her.

353
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,497
She's cold.

354
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,862
She's cold and wet.

355
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:14,160
Lucy, Lucy, sit down. Sit down.

356
00:35:21,014 --> 00:35:24,675
Mulder, they found Wade's car
north of here.

357
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,941
- They're in the water.
- What?

358
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:33,961
There's a river near here.
I think that's where they are.

359
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,283
But the river's east, and they found
Wade's car a mile north.

360
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:39,978
Well, Wade lives here.
He knows these woods.
He could be doubling back.

361
00:35:42,942 --> 00:35:43,846
Did she tell you that?

362
00:35:43,896 --> 00:35:46,448
No, but I think that's what
she's trying to do.

363
00:35:46,548 --> 00:35:49,535
Mulder, wait!

364
00:35:49,601 --> 00:35:53,581
Stay with her, and get word
to Eubanks that Wade may be
heading towards the river.

365
00:36:05,065 --> 00:36:10,267
Please. Stop.
I can't.

366
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,755
 Come on! They're comin'!

367
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:15,377
- I can't! Please.

368
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:18,363
Nobody--

369
00:36:20,029 --> 00:36:22,482
Nobody's gonna spoil us.

370
00:36:22,551 --> 00:36:25,162
No! No, no!

371
00:36:34,802 --> 00:36:39,072
Can you sit up? Can you breathe?
Are you able to breathe?

372
00:36:42,163 --> 00:36:43,204
This is Agent Kreski.

373
00:36:43,241 --> 00:36:47,039
I've got what looks like an
emergency medical situation.
Requesting E.M.S. Over.

374
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:04,282
Wade!

375
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:06,573
Federal officer!
Hold it right there!

376
00:37:35,737 --> 00:37:38,449
She's not breathing.

377
00:37:38,526 --> 00:37:40,534
No pulse either.

378
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:49,254
One, two, three, four--

379
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:53,315
- Come on, Amy, breathe!

380
00:37:53,385 --> 00:37:56,030
...two, three, four, five--

381
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:03,906
There's nothing.

382
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,090
Mulder, it's no good.

383
00:38:06,138 --> 00:38:07,978
- I'm sorry.
- Damn it, Amy! Come on!

384
00:38:08,798 --> 00:38:11,029
Now stop. You can't help her.

385
00:38:13,007 --> 00:38:15,777
Mulder, it's no use.

386
00:38:15,846 --> 00:38:19,634
Mulder, stop it.
Stop it!

387
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:21,761
Mulder, stop!

388
00:38:46,641 --> 00:38:50,129
Mulder!

389
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:58,694
She's breathing.

390
00:38:58,746 --> 00:39:01,754
- Have you got her?
- Yeah, we've got her.

391
00:39:05,419 --> 00:39:08,352
You have to get an E.M.S. unit here
right away with some heat and oxygen.

392
00:39:08,456 --> 00:39:11,123
They're close. We've got them
up at Wade's place right now.

393
00:39:11,178 --> 00:39:14,351
They're working on Lucy Householder.

394
00:39:17,002 --> 00:39:20,743
I'm cold. I want to go home.

395
00:39:20,803 --> 00:39:23,248
It's getting dark.
We have to get her off the river.

396
00:39:40,265 --> 00:39:41,787
[Woman On Police Radio]
Rescue22, clear frequencies.

397
00:39:41,841 --> 00:39:44,488
I don't know what happened.
She started coughing,
then she couldn't breathe.

398
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:46,904
By the time the E.M.S. guys
got here, she was already gone.

399
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:01,268
- How's Amy?
- She's exhausted,

400
00:41:01,327 --> 00:41:03,433
but it looks like she's gonna be fine.

401
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:06,409
The doctors want to keep her
for a day or two, just to be sure.

402
00:41:06,491 --> 00:41:08,155
How serious were her injuries?

403
00:41:08,221 --> 00:41:13,295
Wade must have left her alone.
There were no injuries.

404
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:15,961
He must have dragged her
through the woods for at least a mile.

405
00:41:16,063 --> 00:41:19,042
I know, Mulder.
I can't explain it.

406
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:21,188
She didn't have a cut on her.

407
00:41:21,297 --> 00:41:24,252
And nobody wants to talk about that
right now. Everyone’s just relieved...

408
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:26,789
to have her back again,
to have her safe.

409
00:41:26,858 --> 00:41:29,046
They finish up on Lucy?

410
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:34,021
Yes, they, uh-- They brought in
the state pathologist last night.

411
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:37,673
So I stopped by to get
the autopsy reports on my way.

412
00:41:37,765 --> 00:41:40,248
She drowned, didn't she?

413
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,436
They found five liters
of water in her lungs.

414
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:49,566
She saved Amy's life.

415
00:41:49,659 --> 00:41:52,151
Mulder,

416
00:41:54,663 --> 00:41:57,183
whatever there was between them,

417
00:41:57,278 --> 00:42:01,008
you were part of that connection--
did you think about that?

418
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:04,191
Lucy may have died for Amy,

419
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:07,355
but without you, they never
would have found her.

420
00:42:07,451 --> 00:42:10,243
I think she died
for more than Amy.

421
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:12,913
What do you mean?

422
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:19,358
I think, finally, it was...

423
00:42:19,424 --> 00:42:22,854
the only way she could escape.

424
00:42:22,962 --> 00:42:25,760
The only way she could forget
what happened 17 years ago.

425
00:42:28,801 --> 00:42:32,567
It was finally the only way
she could outrun Carl Wade.
