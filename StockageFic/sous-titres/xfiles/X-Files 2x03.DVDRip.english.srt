00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,995
<i>(alarm)</i>

2
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,752
Ow!

3
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,432
Hey, Ed?

4
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,398
- You OK?
- There's blood.

5
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,191
It's only a paper cut.

6
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,794
Uh, listen, Ed. I need to talk to you.

7
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,474
Ed, I... This is never easy.

8
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,316
And everybody down here
sure likes you a lot, Funschie.

9
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,473
And I know it's tough
cos you're new to this area.

10
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,757
Ed, I'm sorry, but I'm
gonna have to let you go.

11
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,675
I mean, your work is first-rate
and, like I said, you're a good guy.

12
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,309
But you know the story:
Cutbacks and seniority.

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,392
And you're a low man on the pole.

14
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,470
Could I work part time?

15
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,671
The guys took up a collection today.

16
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,955
It's a hundred bucks.

17
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,590
Look, why don't you stay on
till the end of the week?

18
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,674
<i>(lift door opens)</i>

19
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,797
- Is there room here for me?
- I think we can make some.

20
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,871
Thank you.

21
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,357
<i>(woman)</i> Excuse me.

22
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,111
It's OK.

23
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,034
<i>(uneven breathing)</i>

24
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,394
- Hey, Ralph. How you doin'?
- All right.

25
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,471
Thanks for coming at short notice.

26
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,998
I realise the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit
mainly profiles murder suspects still at large.

27
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,029
It must be odd being asked to profile
our suspects, all of whom are dead.

28
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,870
I am relieved the Bureau
answered our request and sent you.

29
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,875
In all honesty, Agent Mulder, whatever's
going on here is way over our heads.

30
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,438
The suspect's body is out on the sidewalk.

31
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,840
We're holding the security guard
who shot him.

32
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,358
The witnesses in the elevator are down at the
hospital. Talk to them whenever you're ready.

33
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,633
I've asked all the businesses
in the building to close for the day.

34
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,714
We've done our best to preserve the area
for you. We've photographed the scene.

35
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,918
The area's been sketched,
but we haven't dusted for prints yet.

36
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,470
We wanted to wait for you
before collecting further evidence.

37
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,154
Was this damaged during the incident?

38
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,394
- I'll find out.
- May I see the suspect?

39
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,390
Things like this aren't
supposed to happen here.

40
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,873
A 42-year-old real-estate agent murders four
strangers? That shouldn't happen anywhere.

41
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,635
Since colonial times there's only
been three murders in this area.

42
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,395
In the last six months,
seven people have killed 22.

43
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:51,191
Per capita, that's higher than the combined
homicide rate of Detroit, DC and Los Angeles.

44
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,718
This town is not any of those places. In
Franklin, you never have to pull off the road...

45
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,349
...to make way for a celebrity
driving with a gun to his head.

46
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,000
In each incident, the suspect was killed?

47
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,389
Suicide. By cop.

48
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,869
Each incident occurred in a public place.

49
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,838
The suspect went crazy and refused to desist.

50
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,275
Officers used deadly force to save lives.

51
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,318
Were autopsies conducted
for substance abuse?

52
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,951
This town is mainly made up of apple and
cherry growers. Folks here don't drink much.

53
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,238
They certainly don't do drugs.
The coroner's tests were negative.

54
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,110
<i>(radio) This is Dispatch. Can you provide</i>
<i>additional backup for unit 42?</i>

55
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,998
Played softball
with this guy over Labor Day.

56
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,034
He was one of those nice guys. Couldn't play
and didn't bitch about being in right field.

57
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,190
What's wrong with right field?

58
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,592
Always the first to shake hands at the end
of the game, whether he'd won or lost.

59
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,114
You gotta have an arm to play right field.

60
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,988
Bought a round of beers afterwards,
even though he didn't drink.

61
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,196
<i>I played right field.

62
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,712
Let's have this analysed by the Bureau's lab.

63
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,513
What the hell could bring anyone to do this?

64
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,153
- <i>(child)</i> I wanna go home.
- <i>(mother)</i> Don't be in such a hurry.

65
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,277
You'll just have to wait
for the man to finish, OK?

66
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,437
- Mommy...
- Baby, you're bleeding.

67
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,432
Come on, tilt your head back.

68
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,988
I told you to leave it alone. OK?

69
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,077
Now, don't touch it or it'll bleed again.

70
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,230
Tilt your head back. There you go.

71
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,033
Lucky we had a Kleenex, eh?

72
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,156
Good girl.

73
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,512
Hey! Hey!

74
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,591
What the hell's wrong with you?

75
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,678
<i>(Mulder) Mass murderers are divided into two</i>
<i>classifications: The spree killer and the serial.</i>

76
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,595
<i>The violent outburst in a public locale...</i>

77
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,752
<i>... and the suspect's disregard</i>
<i>for anonymity or survival...</i>

78
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,230
<i>... define the Franklin incidents</i>
<i>as spree killings.</i>

79
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,513
<i>The confounding element of these profiles</i>
<i>is that, given their backgrounds...</i>

80
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,114
<i>... the perpetrators would be, statistically...</i>

81
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,751
<i>... more likely the victims of violent crimes</i>
<i>rather than the originators.</i>

82
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,230
<i>The killers were all middle-income,</i>
<i>responsible people...</i>

83
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,914
<i>... none with a history of violence.</i>

84
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,073
<i>Relatives reported only minor</i>
<i>displays of dysfunctional behaviour:</i>

85
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,948
<i>... sleep disorders, headaches,</i>
<i>eating difficulties.</i>

86
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,512
<i>But witnesses did report the last suspect</i>
<i>displayed a claustrophobic reaction.</i>

87
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,510
<i>I'm convinced</i>
<i>an outside factor is responsible...</i>

88
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,752
<i>... but I must concede frustration</i>
<i>as to a determination of the cause.</i>

89
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,594
<i>A residue on the fingers of</i>
<i>the most recent perpetrator was analysed...</i>

90
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,708
<i>... and reported to be an undefined but</i>
<i>non-toxic organic chemical found on plants...</i>

91
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,712
<i>... perhaps remaining from gardening.</i>

92
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,352
<i>There have been reported abductee</i>
<i>paranoia in UFO mass-abduction cases.</i>

93
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,431
I was wondering when you'd get to that.

94
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,796
<i>I find no evidence of this to be the case.</i>

95
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,155
<i>The single connecting trace evidence...</i>

96
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,233
<i>... is the destruction of</i>
<i>an electronic device at the crime scene.</i>

97
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,835
<i>A pager, a fax machine.</i>

98
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,196
<i>A cellular phone, a gas pump digital display.</i>

99
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,753
<i>In all honesty, Scully, I've never had</i>
<i>a more difficult time developing a profile.</i>

100
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,718
<i>There is no way to know who will be a killer.</i>

101
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,711
<i>Or who will be killed.</i>

102
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,871
<i>(whistling and chinking)</i>

103
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,472
Hello?

104
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,472
Hello?

105
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,154
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.

106
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,390
I called earlier.
A deadline came up at work.

107
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,590
If it's ready, I'll just
pay you and be out of here.

108
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,150
How did you manage to break that, anyhow?

109
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,231
Oh, it's a long story.

110
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,993
- Did you fix it?
- It's fixed.

111
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,355
What do I owe you?

112
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,513
I'll tell you. In fixing that,
I found some other problems.

113
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,909
Serious problems, Mrs McRoberts.

114
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,911
Come back here. I'll show you.

115
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,750
I'm sorry... My husband's waiting for me.

116
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,716
- I have to go.
- OK.

117
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,634
But you ain't gonna go very far
unless you get this fixed.

118
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,948
Come here.

119
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,395
<i>(mechanic whistles)</i>

120
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,871
<i>(engine starts)</i>

121
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,517
This is a diagnostic test of your engine.

122
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,718
You're supposed to have an output
of 168 horses at 6200rpms.

123
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,071
You're nowhere near that.

124
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,877
Come over here.

125
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,236
Next to me. I want you to take a look at this.

126
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,155
Well, first of all, you're leaking oil like crazy.

127
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,835
Your throw rods are chattering,
valves need adjustment...

128
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,913
A couple of engine mounts
should be replaced.

129
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,758
To tell you the truth...

130
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,308
If you don't believe me, take a look here.

131
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,548
Aarghh!

132
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,909
Agent Mulder?
Larry Winter, county supervisor.

133
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,471
Uh, pardon my rubber.

134
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,553
Can you tell me if this murder
is more of the same?

135
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,074
They don't seem to be connected.

136
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,993
Well, should I be relieved or more scared?

137
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,072
I mean, is this the start of copycat killers?

138
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,197
Larry, it's not a copy
of the other homicides.

139
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,068
This wasn't a public area.
The suspect fled, covering his tracks.

140
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,115
The killer appears
not to have had a premeditated weapon.

141
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,711
They <i>are</i> connected.

142
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,358
- Mrs McRoberts?
- Yes.

143
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,150
This is Sheriff Spencer. I'm Agent
Fox Mulder with the FBI. May we come in?

144
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,310
- I'm late for work.
- You can blame me.

145
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,519
- Been having some car trouble?
- That's my husband's department.

146
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,991
- May I speak with him?
- He took the car to Pittsburgh for a meeting.

147
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,073
- Is it OK if I have my breakfast?
- It's the day's most important meal.

148
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,599
Um, this invoice was, uh, signed by you.

149
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,194
Did you pick up the car last night?

150
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,191
Yes.

151
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,556
Can you describe to me exactly how
the dashboard read-out was damaged?

152
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,711
Mrs McRoberts?

153
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,032
I did it.

154
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,668
- I broke it.
- Why?

155
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,790
Mrs McRoberts?

156
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,470
Did you see something in the read-out?

157
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,758
Mrs McRoberts?

158
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,432
I can help.

Mrs McRoberts?

160
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,399

<i>... but rather from wear.</i>

168
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,553
<i>Other physiological evidence present</i>
<i>indicated episodes of intense phobia.</i>

169
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,315
<i>Analysis of the vitreous humour,</i>
<i>extracted from the eyeball...</i>

170
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,589
<i>... indicated the presence of high concentration</i>
<i>of an undetermined chemical compound.</i>

171
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,398
<i>This compound, at its base...</i>

172
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,156
<i>... is similar to the substance analysed</i>
<i>earlier on a perpetrator's finger.</i>

173
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,869
<i>Although further qualitative</i>
<i>analysis must be performed...</i>

174
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,748
<i>... it is my opinion that this chemical,</i>
<i>when reacting with adrenaline...</i>

175
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,116
<i>... and other compounds</i>
<i>secreted during phobic episodes...</i>

176
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,751
<i>... creates a substance similar</i>
<i>to lysergic acid diethylamide:</i>

177
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,831
<i>... LSD.</i>

178
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,473
Pardon me. I'd like to apply for ajob.

179
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,757
Sorry. They're not accepting
applications at this time.

180
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,076
Sir, may we ask you
to sign up for the blood drive?

181
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,591
Are you all right?

182
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,872
Sir?

183
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,711
<i>(insects buzz)</i>

184
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,711
Hmm.

185
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,639
In our April edition of <i>The Lone Gunman,</i> we
ran an article on the CIA's new CCDTH-2138...

186
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,188
...fibreoptic-lens micro-video camera.

187
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,113
Small enough to be
placed on the back of a fly.

188
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,078
Imagine being a fly
on the wall of the Oval Office.

189
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,276
Been there. Done that.

190
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,510
That is a Eurasian cluster fly.

191
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,754
They infest vegetation like apples or cherries
and can inflict a lot of damage to crops.

192
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,434
It's been irradiated to control propagation.

193
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,717
Or... agents of competing
agricultural corporations...

194
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:34,557
...posing as Franklin City employees, are
releasing fertile flies to destroy the crop.

195
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,756
No. This bug's been nuked.

196
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,990
It was a fine effort, though.

197
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,030
Have you ever come across
this chemical compound?

198
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,111
LSDM?

199
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,034
Obviously you haven't read
our August edition of <i>TLG.</i>

200
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,353
Oh, I'm sorry, boys. It arrived the same day
as my subscription to <i>Celebrity Skin.</i>

201
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,431
Come over here.

202
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,112
- So, Mulder, where's your little partner?
- She wouldn't come.

203
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,273
- She's afraid of her love for you.
- She's tasty.

204
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,636
Frohike, it's men like you
that give perversion a bad name.

205
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,439
Here. Toxic pesticides.

206
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,715
The chemical in that report
is called lysergic dimethrin...

207
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,429
...an unreleased experimental
synthetic botanical insecticide.

208
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,990
- It acts as a natural pheromone.
- LSDM is sprayed on the plant...

209
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,517
...which invokes a fear response in the pest:
"Get out of here. There's danger."

210
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,831
- The insect leaves the plant.
- Why won't they release it?

211
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,673
Is it possible it affects
humans in the same way?

212
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,990
Possible?

213
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,071
Let me show you something.

214
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,838
This is actual newsreel
footage taken in the '50s.

215
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:54,472
They're spraying DDT, a chemical the
government did release and determine safe.

216
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:59,315
30 years later they found out women exposed
to it had higher rates of breast cancer.

217
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,109
They convinced local officials
it was safe to spray on children.

218
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,309
It took a decade of bureaucratic and
industry heel-dragging before it was banned.

219
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,155
- Different chemicals. Same stunts.
- They just learned how not to be so obvious.

220
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,198
Hey, Frohike, can I borrow those?

221
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,475
If I can have Scully's phone number.

222
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,751
<i>(distant rumbling)</i>

223
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,434
<i>(rumbling)</i>

224
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,950
Stealth helicopters? Experimental pesticides
responsible for violent behaviour?

225
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,555
I saw the chopper from two
different locations. Look at my skin.

226
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,234
Feel my hair. The insecticide is still on me.

227
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,754
I've checked up on you.

228
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,071
You have a penchant for "spooky" evidence.

229
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,709
- Don't start that crap. Don't divert blame.
- Hang on a second...

230
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,836
If you're the one who's responsible...

231
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,674
...the sooner you take responsibility,
the sooner people will stop dying.

232
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,070
The killers all resided
near heavily sprayed areas.

233
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:14,632
You don't live here, Mulder.
I live here. I have my heart in this town.

234
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,917
I have three children.
I'm not gonna dump poison on them.

235
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,958
Yeah, well, if it's so safe,
why was it done in secret?

236
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,636
- What kind of a crusade are you on?
- Answer the question. Are we spraying?

237
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,439
This county lives on money
generated from its crops.

238
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,670
Irradiated flies were not effective.

239
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,594
The delays to get approval would
have caused millions in crop damage.

240
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,399
Look at the hell they raised over Malathion.

241
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,234
Meanwhile, people's lives were
being ruined by a damn bug.

242
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,233
Ruined? 23 people are dead.

243
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,472
There's no proof the spray caused
violent behaviour. It was proven safe.

244
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,074
By who? Who proved it to you?

245
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,477
<i>(door closes)</i>

246
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,028
I'm sorry, Mulder, he's right.

247
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,351
I'd love to say I flew 300 miles
in the middle of the night...

248
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,671
...to prove you're about to become
the next Charles Manson.

249
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,672
But I find little physiological evidence...

250
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,390
...that states that LSDM has toxically
affected you, even after massive ingestion.

251
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,870
Your own autopsy says
the killer had chemical anomalies.

252
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,829
Yes, but you are proof that
it wasn't from exposure to LSDM.

253
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,195
May I see that chart, Agent Scully?

254
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,191
Sure.

255
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,192
Look here. These are normal...

256
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,598
<i>(Scully)...</i> perhaps subjected
to repeated LSDM spraying.

257
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,514
Scully, are you familiar
with subliminal messages?

258
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,673
You mean like... sex and
ice cubes in liquor ads?

259
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,910
- That's paranoia.
- No, it's a fact.

260
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,312
Stores use subliminal messages in
their ambient music to deter shoplifting.

261
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,076
The Russians use electro-encephalographic
techniques to control behaviour.

262
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:16,554
- How is this connected with the spraying?
- Electronic devices were always destroyed.

263
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,393
- I'm still waiting.
- The insecticide LSDM...

264
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,675
...is known to cause fear in cluster flies.

265
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,356
What if it causes the same reaction
in humans? All the perpetrators were phobic.

266
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,558
Taber was claustrophobic. McRoberts's
husband said she had a fear of rape.

267
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,394
The insecticide heightened
their phobia to an unbearable level.

268
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,508
The electronic devices relayed messages that
told them what to do in order to alleviate it.

269
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,388
- The messages were relayed purposely.
- By who?

270
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,117
He's probably one of those people
that thinks Elvis is dead.

271
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,069
Mulder, I was wrong. Exposure to
the insecticide <i>does</i> induce paranoia.

272
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,755
I think this area is being subjected
to a controlled experiment.

273
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,798
Controlled by who? By the government?

274
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,155
By a corporation? By Reticulans?

275
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:22,712
They've done it before. DDT in the '50s, Agent
Orange, germ warfare on unsuspecting areas.

276
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,920
Yes, but why, Mulder? Why intentionally
create a populace that destroys itself?

277
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,911
Fear.

278
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,391
It's the oldest tool of power. If you're
distracted by fear of those around you...

279
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,995
...it keeps you from seeing
the actions of those above.

280
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,673
I just had a talk with Mr Winter.

281
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,194
I've persuaded him to a compromise.

282
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,031
He's agreed to stop the spraying...

283
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,033
...and to blood testing extensively
of people exposed to the spray area.

284
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,269
But?

285
00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:00,356
But the official explanation for the testing
cannot be linked to the side effects of LSDM.

286
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,114
<i>Franklin and Venango Counties</i>

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,595
Have you seen this man?

331
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,878
I picked him up.
Drove four feet and he went apewire.

332
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,111
- Where'd you let him out?
- Near the college.

333
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,389
- We'll have to wait him out.
- I don't think <i>he's</i> waiting.

334
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,710
- Scully, anything?
- Nothing.

00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,435
<i>Take cover.</i>

341
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,071
I've seen that. I've seen that and
I don't want to see that again, baby.

Put it down!

348
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,992
- Don't kill me.
- Then put it down, Ed.

349
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,796
I can't. They won't let me.

350
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,953
I know they won't, Ed.
I know they won't let you.

351
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,831
Then...

352
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,514
<i>You</i> make me put it down, then.

353
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,791
You do it.

354
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,431
If you don't put it down...

355
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,911
...I'm gonna have to shoot you.

356
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,789
Or you're gonna have to shoot me.

357
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,432
There's gonna be blood everywhere.

358
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,034
Oh... Ah.

359
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,119
Agh!

360
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,874
- Don't kill me.
- It's all right.

361
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,758
Agent Scully will
examine him at the hospital.

362
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,877
I want unrestricted access
to him for questioning.

363
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,953
Mulder, you know more about
what happened to him than he does.
