- Aspirated his chest.

11
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:52,128
He has a tension pneumothorax pressing
on his heart. It looked like a cardiac.

12
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,034
- Nice catch. How did you know?
- Because he's dying of cancer.

13

It's already eaten through

Pretty cozy.
Who'd ever want to leave?

Well, whoever happened to get
locked in here last night, I guess.

27
00:05:27,774 --> 00:05:31,005
Well, that would be one
Leonard Morris Betts, age 34.

28
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:33,944
But it should probably be noted that
when Mr. Betts arrived here last night,

29
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:35,948
he was sans head.

30
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:38,007
He was decapitated
when his ambulance crashed.

31
00:05:38,084 --> 00:05:41,212
He was an emergency medical
technician for this hospital.

32
00:05:41,287 --> 00:05:43,847
A very good one, apparently.
A slew of commendations.

33
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:46,289
- Write-ups in the local paper.
- What about the morgue attendant?

34
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:48,725
Somebody cold cocked him
and stole his clothes.

35
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:51,729
He didn't see who. No alarms
tripped, no sign of a break-in.

- It's weird, huh?
- Mulder, what are we doing here?

Did I mention
that Mr. Betts had no head?

38
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:01,739
Yes. So? I mean, you're not
suggesting that a headless body...

39
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:03,867
kicked its way out of
a latched morgue freezer?

40
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:09,245
Are you ? Because it's obvious this is
some kind of attempt at a cover-up.

41
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:12,807
- Meant to conceal what?
- My guess, body snatching for profit.

42
00:06:12,886 --> 00:06:15,514
There's a shortage of teaching
cadavers at medical schools.

pay top dollar, no questions asked.

all this stuff here?

Bad video. The security system
isn't exactly state-of-the-art.

If this is our guy, what did
he do with the corpse he stole?

53
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:50,387
Well, maybe he got spooked
and was forced to abandon it.

54
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:53,620
We combed the facility. Where could he
hide a body where it couldn't be found?

I'll show you.

56
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:02,029
All hospitals operate some form
of medical waste processing.

of surgical remains:

amputations, excised tumors.

59

They're ground up
and heated with microwaves,

60
00:07:11,544 --> 00:07:15,503
and the result is a sterile soot
that's used as road fill.

61
00:07:15,582 --> 00:07:17,777
Well, then there's probably
nothing there for us to find.

62
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:20,877

they dispose otherwise.

Hopefully, only once
every few days.

if you’re not sure, I don't see...

- Leonard Betts.
- That's his head. Where's his body?

70
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:07,432
There's not enough room in here.
Maybe he didn't dispose of the body.

71
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,434
Maybe he got it out of here
somehow.

72
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:11,527
Well, why'd he take the time
to dispose of the head?

73
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:15,472
I don't know. Maybe there's an answer
here. Something you should check out.

74
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:19,410
We know how he died, in an automobile
accident. What more is there to know?

00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:21,811
Maybe nothing, but it's all
we got to go on right now.

00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:24,475

where you can examine Betts' head.

- While you do what?
- Check out his house.

Weight, 1 0.9 pounds.

83
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,758
Remains show no signs of rigor mortis
or fixed lividity.

84
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,127
Nor do the corneas
appear clouded,

85
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:12,687
which would seem inconsistent
with the witnessed time of death,

86
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:16,064

87
00:09:17,604 --> 00:09:21,768

incision and frontal craniotomy,

88
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:25,208

a unique situation here.

97
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:34,364
- What'd you find?
- So far, not much.

98
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,898
I did a PET scan
on Leonard Betts' remains.

99
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:42,277
Actually four times now. And each time
the images come out degraded,

100
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:44,282
uh, like it's fogged
somehow.

101
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:49,515
- Like the security footage.
- This is cutting-edge technology here.

102
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:52,820
The technicians say the machine
is working perfectly.

103
00:11:52,892 --> 00:11:55,986
They also say the only thing that could
account for this image distortion...

104
00:11:56,062 --> 00:11:57,962
is some form of radiation.

105
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:01,762
But I don't see how or where
it could be emanating from.

106
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:03,426

uncover?

Well, l-- I haven't exactly
performed an examination yet.

108

- Why not?
- Well, because l, uh--

109
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:16,141
I experienced an unusual degree
of postmortem galvanic response.

110
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:18,217
The head moved.

111
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:20,149
It blinked at me.

112
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:23,347
I mean, I know
exactly what it is.

113
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:27,484
It's residual electrical activity stored
chemically in-- in the dead cells.

114
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,494
Blinked or winked?

115
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:32,793
- [ Sighs ]
- You're afraid to cut into it.

116
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:36,232
Scully, you're not saying that--
that-- that it's alive, are you?

117
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:38,862
No. I am certainly
not saying that at all.

118
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:41,372
But has it crossed your mind
that it's not quite dead, either?

119
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:45,172
- What do you mean?
- I'm standing here in Betts' apartment.

clothes are strewn all over the floor.

how to respond to that.

put the building under surveillance...

You're the person responsible for the
disposition of Leonard Betts' remains.

131
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:04,980
He didn't have any family. No friends
either, as far as I could tell.

132

- Except you.
- I liked him.

133
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:12,924
But I wasn't really his friend.
He didn't let people get that close.

134
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:16,024
I'm not sure I could call myself his
partner. Mostly I stayed out of his way.

135
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:20,299
- What do you mean?
- Leonard was an amazing technician.

136
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:24,639
He could diagnose illness
better than any doctor I've ever seen.

137
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:29,340
You know how they say some people can
look at you and tell you what's wrong?

138
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:31,349
- Mm-hmm.
- Leonard could do that.

139
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:35,581
Especially with cancer. I told him
he should have been an oncologist.

140
00:14:35,655 --> 00:14:39,921
He used to volunteer at the cancer ward.
Read to patients, stuff like that.

141
00:14:39,992 --> 00:14:43,052
Did you ever notice anything
about him? Anything odd?

142
00:14:44,163 --> 00:14:47,724
No. Well,
he never got sick.

143
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,802
That was pretty amazing,
doing what we do.

144
00:14:50,903 --> 00:14:54,304
- He was the picture of health.
- Was he ever injured on the job?

145
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:57,900
No. Never.
I mean, until--

146
00:14:57,977 --> 00:15:01,640
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm sorry.

147
00:15:01,714 --> 00:15:05,650
I-l don't know what all this has to do
with someone stealing Leonard's body.

148
00:15:05,718 --> 00:15:08,778
I mean, it almost sounds
like you’re investigating Leonard.

149
00:15:08,854 --> 00:15:13,291
No, no. Thanks for bearing with
my questions. I appreciate your time.

150
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:30,537
This procedure is called
biopolymerization.

151
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,238
It's basically a high-tech
mummification process.

152
00:15:33,312 --> 00:15:36,304
The remains are dipped in the epoxy,
and once it's cured,

153
00:15:36,382 --> 00:15:39,442
the specimen can be sliced
for examination.

154
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:41,986
Or you got yourself
a nice paperweight.

155
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:46,787
At any rate, we should have
some autopsy answers for you soon.

156
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:51,387
I'm starting with an anterior
slice from your Mr. Betts,

157
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:54,728
one favoring the frontal lobe.

158
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:04,943
- Well, this is certainly strange.
- What?

159
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:06,945
There's something wrong
with the image?

160
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:09,641
In a manner of speaking.

161
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:11,649
Here, see for yourself.

162
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:19,119
Oh, my God. His entire brain
looks like one giant glioma.

163
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:22,024
- He had cancer?
- He was riddled with it.

164

You said that Betts' tissue
was riddled with cancer.

Now, what is cancer but normal cells

going with this.

cancer was not caused by damaged DNA ?

Where the cancer was not a destructive
or an aggressive factor,

of being?

You think that Leonard Betts
regrew his head?

224
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,492
The fluid that I found in Betts'
bathtub was povidone-iodine.

225
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:22,625
It's used by researchers on reptiles
and amphibians to aid regeneration.

226

We both know that salamanders have
grown entirely new limbs-- regenerated.

Salamanders are one thing, but no mammal
possesses that regenerative power.
