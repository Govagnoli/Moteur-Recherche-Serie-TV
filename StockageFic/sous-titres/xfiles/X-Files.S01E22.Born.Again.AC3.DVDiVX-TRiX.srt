1
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,972  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What ho.

2
00:00:35,082 --> 00:00:36,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What ho.

3
00:00:36,383 --> 00:00:40,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, Lazard, why do the night
guys get a piece likeyou

4
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and we're stuckwith eel breath?

5
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:44,985  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's fate, Detective...

6
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:48,027  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
conspiring to keep us apart.

7
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:50,256  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right, I'm out ofhere.

8
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,600  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Seeya.

9
00:01:19,126 --> 00:01:20,923  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You all right?

10
00:01:21,895 --> 00:01:23,328  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You lost?

11
00:01:29,403 --> 00:01:32,861  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I got her in the holding room,
but she won't say a word.

12
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're asking me

13
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:36,298  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
becauseyou know
how good I am with kids.

14
00:01:36,376 --> 00:01:38,401  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah, a regular
Mr. Greenjeans.

15
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:47,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hi.

16
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is Detective Barbala.

17
00:01:49,222 --> 00:01:51,850  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's going to helpyou
find your parents.

18
00:01:51,925 --> 00:01:53,859  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hiya, sweetheart.

19
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:55,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's your name?

20
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:56,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Michelle.

21
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:01,696  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Everything's going
to be all right, okay?

22
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:03,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't be scared now.

23
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:10,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Michelle what?

24
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:14,412  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You said your first name
is Michelle.

25
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:17,006  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now, what's
your last name?

26
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:18,243  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bishop.

27
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:20,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bishop.

28
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:21,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Michelle Bishop.

29
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:24,422  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And where doyou live, Michelle?

30
00:02:24,491 --> 00:02:26,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here in Buffalo?

31
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:34,764  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What was that?

32
00:02:34,835 --> 00:02:36,735  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Did you hear that?

33
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:38,896  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(Clamoring)

34
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:48,305  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Man:
Somebody call an ambulance!

35
00:03:54,648 --> 00:03:56,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mulder:
How did you hear about us?

36
00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:00,547  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My brother. My brother's
a cop in Baltimore.

37
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He told me aboutyourwork
on the Tooms case.

38
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:06,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He said you got a good feel
for things out ofthe ordinary.

39
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:09,887  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look, the truth is,
Barbala neverwon

40
00:04:09,963 --> 00:04:12,056  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
any popularity contests
here at the 1 -4

41
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:15,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but he's still a cop, you know.

42
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:19,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I guess that's why
I can'tjust let this rest.

43
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:22,104  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You said
there was one witness--

44
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:24,336  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
a little girl.
What did she say happened?

45
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:26,777  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She said there
was another man in the room.

46
00:04:26,846 --> 00:04:29,144  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- It stands to reason that--
- I was right outside.

47
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:31,615  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There was nobody else there
except Barbala and the kid.

48
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:33,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Soyou didn't
get a description

49
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:34,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
ofwho the kid saw.

50
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:38,780  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm telling you,
there was no one else.

51
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:42,885  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Listen, the department's
treating this as a suicide

52
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:44,760  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but I got to tell you,
I knew this guy.

53
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:46,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's no way
he did himself.

54
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,124  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Was he depressed

55
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:51,226  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
or under psychiatric care
ofany kind?

56
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:54,205  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No. The only time
he ever looked at himself

57
00:04:54,274 --> 00:04:55,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
was in the mirror

58
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:58,443  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and he always liked
what he saw.

59
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:06,208  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Plusjumpers tend to open
the window before theyjump.

60
00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:07,412  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where's the kid?

61
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:09,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She was released
an hour ago.

62
00:05:09,422 --> 00:05:11,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Her mother picked her up.

63
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:15,490  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You don't really think the girl
had anything to do with it.

64
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:17,052  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Eightyears
on the force

65
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I've seen a lot
ofstrange things

66
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:22,523  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but I'm telling you,
this kid...

67
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:25,264  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
something'sjust not right
about her.

68
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:27,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mulder:
Long hair or short hair?

69
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:29,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Short.

70
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:34,343  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Like that?

71
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:37,783  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Was his hair
dark like mine

72
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:39,614  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
or lighter likeyours?

73
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:41,381  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Like mine.

74
00:05:44,457 --> 00:05:46,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What about
a beard or a moustache?

75
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:49,020  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Moustache.

76
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:50,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(Whispers)

77
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:55,166  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Man:
Like this?

78
00:05:58,038 --> 00:05:59,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Or this?

79
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:05,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Whoa, what happened?

80
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:08,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Weird.

81
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:10,849  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I didn't even hit a key.

82
00:06:12,352 --> 00:06:16,083  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Must be a glitch
in the new software.

83
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,018  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mulder:
Michelle, was his moustache like that?

84
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:25,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Scully:
Doyou have any idea

85
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:27,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
howyour daughter
might have gotten there?

86
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:29,468  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Buffalo's halfan hour away
by train

87
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:33,097  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and the station
is a five-minute car ride.

88
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:35,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
When I came home

89
00:06:35,341 --> 00:06:37,707  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mrs. Doughertywas locked
in the wine cellar.

90
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:39,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I called the police
immediately.

91
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:41,747  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And Mrs. Dougherty is..?

92
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:43,578  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Michelle's nanny.

93
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Her latest, that is.

94
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:48,084  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's gone through four
this year, and it's onlyApril.

95
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:51,089  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What seems to be the problem?

96
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:55,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Michelle is the problem.

97
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:01,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How doyou mean?

98
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:05,894  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
As hard as it is
for a mother to admit

99
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:08,803  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Michelle is a disturbed child.

100
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, I know this sounds
terrible to say

101
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:15,340  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but the truth is
that sometimes she frightens me.

102
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:18,282  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Frightens you how?

103
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:22,651  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's not like other girls,
Agent Scully.

104
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:26,648  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tell me.

105
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:30,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Shejust isn't.

106
00:07:30,463 --> 00:07:33,023  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She doesn't have any friends.

107
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:35,761  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She hardly ever smiles.

108
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:40,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It breaks my heart,
but I can't comfort her.

109
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:45,807  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She says she sees things
that I can't see.

110
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:48,177  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She hears peopleyelling
in her head.

111
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:53,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Last summer
we had to cover our pool.

112
00:07:53,586 --> 00:07:56,453  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
jim was trying
to teach her how to swim

113
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:59,492  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but every time that Michelle
would get close to the water

114
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:02,289  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
she wouldjust start
to scream.

115
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:05,525  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Scream likeyou've never heard
in all your life.

116
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your husband,
where is he now?

117
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:11,570  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're divorced.

118
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Mrs. Bishop?
- Mm-hmm.

119
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:25,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is the man Michelle said
she saw at the police station.

120
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:27,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Doyou recognize him?

121
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:29,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, I'm sorry.

122
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:31,817  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She also mentioned
a friend.

123
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:34,257  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Someone named Sheila.

124
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:36,386  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Doyou know who that is?
- That would be Dr. Braun.

125
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:38,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's the developmental
psychologist

126
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:39,988  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
at Brylin Hospital.

127
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:42,364  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Michelle sees her twice a week.

128
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:52,341  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look at that.

129
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:54,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Looks like a hawk

130
00:08:54,113 --> 00:08:56,104  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
or a falcon.

131
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:58,173  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's beautiful.

132
00:08:58,251 --> 00:09:00,845  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- It's called origami.
-Japanese paper folding.

133
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,684  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where did she learn
how to do that?

134
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:05,781  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I have no idea.

135
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:12,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So, Harry, you'll put
that face into the system?

136
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:15,257  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- As we speak.
- Can you give Scully
a ride back to the city?

137
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:17,302  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We have a autopsy
at 7:00.

138
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm going
to Brylin Hospital.

139
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:21,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
See ifl can have
a little chat

140
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,065  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
with Michelle's shrink.

141
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:27,010  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, and check for burns
or lesions on Barbala's body.

142
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:29,806  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why?

143
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:31,976  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Psychokinesis
is usually associated

144
00:09:32,051 --> 00:09:34,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
with an electrical charge.

145
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:37,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Areyou saying Michelle
possesses the ability

146
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to psychically project
her own will?

147
00:09:39,392 --> 00:09:42,122  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How else could a 60-pound kid
throw a 200-pound detective

148
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:44,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
out the window?

149
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:51,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Woman:
No, I don't recognize him.

150
00:09:51,905 --> 00:09:54,169  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I have no idea who he is.

151
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,300  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Could Michelle
have fabricated him?

152
00:09:57,377 --> 00:09:58,867  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Quite possibly.

153
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:01,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
As with many
dissociative disorders

154
00:10:01,147 --> 00:10:03,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
the intensity
ofthe patient's emotions

155
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:06,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
is often too much for
one personality to process.

156
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:08,447  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So, in defense

157
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:10,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
part ofthe personality
splits itselfoff.

158
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,418  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
As in schizophrenia?

159
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:18,260  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm afraid Michelle's diagnosis
is not quite that simple.

160
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:21,027  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My primary challenge
has been to discover

161
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:23,295  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
the source of
her extreme rage.

162
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:24,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
In most cases

163
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:27,338  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
it's a traumatic event
in the patient's past.

164
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:29,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And in Michelle's case?

165
00:10:32,111 --> 00:10:33,908  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Occasionally, I would leave

166
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Michelle alone
for part ofour sessions...

167
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:40,585  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
with this doll.

168
00:10:40,653 --> 00:10:43,121  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Each time a new doll

169
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:45,453  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
anatomically intact.

170
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:47,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And each time she dismembers
and disfigures it

171
00:10:48,027 --> 00:10:50,222  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
in exactly
the same way.

172
00:10:50,296 --> 00:10:52,856  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
At first I thought
she was being abused

173
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:54,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but after a number
ofsessions with her parents

174
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:57,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I became convinced
there was something else

175
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,104  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
behind Michelle's anxiety.

176
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:01,140  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Something much deeper.

177
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Much more elusive.

178
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:04,342  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Any theories?

179
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,105  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Frankly, no.

180
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:08,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm at a loss.

181
00:11:08,348 --> 00:11:11,681  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Haveyou tried
deep-regression hypnosis?

182
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:16,245  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I've found hypnosis
an unreliable approach, at best.

183
00:11:16,322 --> 00:11:18,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Okay. How haveyou
been treating Michelle?

184
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:21,222  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, the Thorazine has been
quite effective

185
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:23,262  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
in regulating
her more bizarre behavior.

186
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:24,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm sure.

187
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:28,660  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Haveyou observed
any unexplained phenomena

188
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:30,861  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
in Michelle's presence?

189
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,063  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
" Unexplained phenomena"?

190
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:37,802  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Inordinate physical strength,
psychic ability, telekinesis.

191
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:41,544  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You'rejoking, ofcourse.

192
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:48,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I have a patient waiting,
Agent Mulder.

193
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:50,690  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ifyou'll excuse me.

194
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:54,623  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Note: Postmortem examination
is being conducted

195
00:11:54,694 --> 00:11:59,097  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
1 1 hours and 45 minutes
after subject was pronounced.

196
00:12:03,202 --> 00:12:06,899  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Note: Raised lesion

197
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:11,340  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
approximately seven centimeters
below sternum.

198
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:16,280  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Deep necrosis inconsistent
with cause ofdeath

199
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:19,250  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
as pronounced by Dr. Gilder

200
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:24,847  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and suggests
localized electrocution...

201
00:12:24,924 --> 00:12:28,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but a further tissue analysis
will be necessary.

202
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:31,058  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Excuse me.

203
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,121  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Could I talk toyou
for a second?

204
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:35,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I just started the autopsy.

205
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:37,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah. Um...

206
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't think
he's going anywhere.

207
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:41,898  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Will you, uh...

208
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:46,775  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
take a couple
for scale, please?

209
00:12:46,846 --> 00:12:49,610  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thankyou.
I'll be right back.

210
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:54,850  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So, what doyou think?

211
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:58,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Scully:
Looks like a match.

212
00:12:58,191 --> 00:12:59,658  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah.

213
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:02,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Name's Officer Charlie Morris.

214
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:04,362  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Used to work Narcotics
out ofthe 2-7.

215
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,022  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Doyou know him?

216
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:08,659  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No. Before my time.

217
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:11,328  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where is he now?
Has he been transferred?

218
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:13,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You could say that.

219
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:16,568  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Agent Scully, this guy's
been dead for nineyears.

220
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:22,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Which means that little girl
saw a ghost.

221
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:41,099  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This way, please.

222
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,100  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He was killed in Chinatown,
gangland style

223
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:51,972  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
allegedly by the Triads

224
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:54,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
although no arrests
were ever made.

225
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:55,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ifyou're going to tell me

226
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:58,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
you think Michelle Bishop
saw a poltergeist...

227
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:01,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You found a lesion
on Barbala's body.

228
00:14:01,154 --> 00:14:03,054  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You said it could
have been caused

229
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:06,250  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
by an intense concentration
ofelectrothermal energy.

230
00:14:06,325 --> 00:14:08,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
"Could have been"
being the operative phrase.

231
00:14:08,828 --> 00:14:11,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I won't know for sure
until the lab results are in.

232
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:13,894  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why is it still so hard
foryou to believe

233
00:14:13,966 --> 00:14:17,094  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
when all evidence suggests
extraordinary phenomena?

234
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Because sometimes...

235
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:20,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What?

236
00:14:20,173 --> 00:14:22,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Iooking for
extreme possibilities

237
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:25,139  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
makes you blind
to the probable explanation

238
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:26,508  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
right in front ofyou.

239
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is the face
that Michelle Bishop saw.

240
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:31,649  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She walked right by here

241
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:34,185  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and she saw the face
ofCharlie Morris

242
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:36,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
which means
there weren't any ghosts

243
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:38,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
fying around the precinct.

244
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:41,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Doyou have the police report
describing Morris' death?

245
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,728  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah. I have
what's been declassified.

246
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:44,922  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why?

247
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:46,658  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Does it describe
how he was murdered?

248
00:14:46,732 --> 00:14:49,565  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, I told you.
It was a signature hit.

249
00:14:49,635 --> 00:14:51,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Give me the grisly details.

250
00:14:55,107 --> 00:14:58,372  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
His arm was severed
just below the shoulder

251
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:00,173  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
presumably by a chain saw

252
00:15:00,246 --> 00:15:02,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and his right eye
was gouged out.

253
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:04,376  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is what Michelle did
to a dozen dolls

254
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,384  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
in her shrink's office.

255
00:15:06,452 --> 00:15:09,182  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hell ofa coincidence,
wouldn'tyou say?

256
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:11,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Before we discount
anything, we should

257
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:13,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
find out more
about Charlie Morris.

258
00:15:13,626 --> 00:15:15,526  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I got the address
ofhis partner on the force.

259
00:15:15,595 --> 00:15:17,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hopefully,
he can tell us something.

260
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:42,143  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Detective Fiore?
We're with the F.B.I.

261
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:44,212  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can we talk toyou
for a minute?

262
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,282  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Doyou know this man?

263
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:02,464  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You mind ifwe do this
out here?

264
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:04,702  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't want
to wake mywife.

265
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,903  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This won't take long.

266
00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:08,708  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sure I know him.
That's Charlie.

267
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:10,442  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Charlie Morris.

268
00:16:10,516 --> 00:16:12,450  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You two
were partners?

269
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:14,884  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We rode together his first nine months
out ofthe academy.

270
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:17,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What can you tell us
about the circumstances

271
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:19,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
surrounding his death?

272
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:31,060  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That matter
is still under investigation

273
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:33,765  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and so I
can't comment on it.

274
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:35,864  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're under the direct authority

275
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:38,569  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
ofCaptain Gershom
at the 1 4th Precinct.

276
00:16:38,678 --> 00:16:40,009  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
1 4th Precinct?

277
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,445  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I neverworked out ofthe 1 -4.

278
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:44,210  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's all this about?

279
00:16:44,283 --> 00:16:46,012  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We believe
that the death

280
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:48,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
of Detective Barbala
can be linked

281
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:50,748  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to the death
ofOfficer Morris.

282
00:16:50,823 --> 00:16:53,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Linked how? I thought
Barbala fipped his wig

283
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:55,690  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
andjumped out a window.

284
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:56,921  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Did you know him?

285
00:16:56,996 --> 00:16:57,963  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
By reputation.

286
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,225  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's all this
got to do with Charlie?

287
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:02,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's what we need
your help with.

288
00:17:02,268 --> 00:17:05,203  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The police report said
Morris was killed offduty.

289
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:08,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Right. Best we can figure,
it was some kind ofpayback.

290
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:09,805  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Forwhat?

291
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The organized
crime division

292
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:14,744  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
was doing a major sweep
in Chinatown.

293
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:16,145  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The Triads?

294
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:19,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Heavy busts went down
against the Woo Shing Woo.

295
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:21,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A lot ofsmack
never made it to the street.

296
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:24,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You can bet there were
some pissed-offpeople

297
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,255  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
playing Mah-jongg that week.

298
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:28,088  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Soyou think
Morris was killed

299
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,855  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
as a warning to back off?

300
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:33,695  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I think they picked
a cop-- any cop--

301
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:35,495  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and theywhacked him.

302
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:37,001  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who is it, Tony?

303
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:39,367  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's nothing
to worry about, honey.

304
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:41,406  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
just some people
from the F.B.I.

305
00:17:41,474 --> 00:17:43,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
asking about a case
I'm working.

306
00:17:43,943 --> 00:17:45,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sir, would
you mind..?

307
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:47,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, it's the weekend.
You guys mind?

308
00:17:47,947 --> 00:17:49,972  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get me at the squad

309
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:51,983  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- first thing Monday morning, okay?
- Sure.

310
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:53,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good luck.

311
00:17:58,624 --> 00:18:00,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is it me, or did we
just get the brushoff?

312
00:18:00,826 --> 00:18:03,226  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Did you notice her hands?
- What?

313
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:05,229  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He said
she was sleeping

314
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:07,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but her hands were dusted
with baking four.

315
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,699  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's not a big deal, all right.

316
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:18,401  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don'tjerk
yourselfaround.

317
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:20,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're acting
like a little bug.

318
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:22,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Theywere F.B.I.

319
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:24,248  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So what?

320
00:18:24,316 --> 00:18:26,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They start sniffing around
too much

321
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:29,447  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
they're going
to turn something up.

322
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:33,686  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Relax. They'rejust people like
us going through the motions.

323
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:35,021  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Then how are they

324
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:36,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
connecting Charlie to Barbala?

325
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:39,053  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And what do they know?

326
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:41,531  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Huh? Nothing.

327
00:18:47,006 --> 00:18:48,496  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on.

328
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:50,541  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're going to Citibank
right now.

329
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:51,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Forwhat?

330
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:53,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The safety box.

331
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:56,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What should we do, Tony? Huh?

332
00:18:56,382 --> 00:18:59,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Make a donation to
the Little Sisters for the Poor?

333
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:02,385  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Dump it somewhere.

334
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:05,481  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tony, there's only
two ofus left now.

335
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:07,492  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's over a million each.

336
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,494  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Take it all. I don't care!

337
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:11,860  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Doyour dream on the beach
in Costa Rica, orwherever

338
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:15,458  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
the hell it is
you want to do it.

339
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:18,367  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You think I like this? Huh?

340
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:21,406  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Selling disability insurance
to morons?

341
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:22,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
"Well, sir, uh...

342
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:25,376  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
excuse me, but what ifyou
should breakyour neck

343
00:19:25,478 --> 00:19:29,505  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
on the shore, or loseyour leg
in a car crash?"

344
00:19:29,582 --> 00:19:31,743  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You listen to me, Tony.

345
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:33,808  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We agreed to wait ten years

346
00:19:33,886 --> 00:19:36,377  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and that is exactly
what we're going to do.

347
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:39,083  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I listened toyou once before,
and lookwhat happened.

348
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:42,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nobody-- not me, not Barbala--

349
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:44,526  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
wanted to see Charlie
wind up like that.

350
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:46,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We werejust trying to scare
a little sense into him.

351
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:51,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It was an accident.

352
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:53,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
End ofstory.

353
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:58,533  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And you better pull yourself
together, Tony.

354
00:20:13,526 --> 00:20:15,426  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Excuse me, sir...

355
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:17,185  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, what..?

356
00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:21,449  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey! Hey, open the door!

357
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:23,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey!

358
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:24,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey! Open the door!

359
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:27,123  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey! Open the door!

360
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,325  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey!

361
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,731  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Open the door! Open the door!

362
00:21:29,802 --> 00:21:31,736  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Open the door! Hey!

363
00:21:31,804 --> 00:21:33,169  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Open the door!

364
00:21:33,238 --> 00:21:34,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey!

365
00:21:37,977 --> 00:21:40,002  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey! Hey!

366
00:21:40,112 --> 00:21:42,342  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey! Open the door!

367
00:21:42,414 --> 00:21:43,904  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey!

368
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:45,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
For God's sake!

369
00:21:45,351 --> 00:21:46,375  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Help me!

370
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:49,014  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(Screaming)

371
00:22:31,563 --> 00:22:33,497  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A patrol unit
picked her up

372
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:35,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
a few blocks away
from the bus stop.

373
00:22:35,668 --> 00:22:37,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's going on?

374
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:42,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We don't know.

375
00:22:42,307 --> 00:22:44,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All we know
is thatyour daughter

376
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:47,642  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
has witnessed two deaths
in the past two days.

377
00:22:47,713 --> 00:22:49,738  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's only eightyears old.

378
00:22:49,848 --> 00:22:51,782  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She couldn't possibly
have done anything.

379
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mrs. Bishop, no one
is accusing Michelle ofanything.

380
00:22:54,586 --> 00:22:57,384  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She'sjust a little girl.

381
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:02,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is there anything
thatyou have not told us?

382
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:04,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is there anything at all
thatyou can think of

383
00:23:04,663 --> 00:23:07,894  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
that might shed some light
on what happened tonight?

384
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:10,025  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No.

385
00:23:10,102 --> 00:23:12,332  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(Sighs)

386
00:23:12,404 --> 00:23:14,338  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, this police station

387
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,374  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
has a designated room
at the Sheraton.

388
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:20,936  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
An officerwill takeyou
and Michelle over there.

389
00:23:21,046 --> 00:23:23,640  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why is this happening to us?
Why?

390
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:31,247  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can I talk toyou
for a minute?

391
00:23:31,323 --> 00:23:34,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

392
00:23:39,031 --> 00:23:40,862  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Listen to this.

393
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:42,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know that guy
that bought it tonight--

394
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:44,061  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Leon Felder?

395
00:23:44,136 --> 00:23:46,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Before he started
peddling life insurance

396
00:23:46,138 --> 00:23:48,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
he was a cop
out ofthe 1 -4.

397
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,565  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Guess who his partner
used to be?

398
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:52,667  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Rudy Barbala.

399
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:57,304  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Scully:
Four cops.

400
00:23:57,416 --> 00:24:01,182  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Three ofwhom are now dead.

401
00:24:01,253 --> 00:24:04,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Their only connection being
a drug bust in Chinatown

402
00:24:04,623 --> 00:24:06,181  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
almost nineyears ago.

403
00:24:06,258 --> 00:24:09,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And a little girl
from Orchard Park.

404
00:24:10,062 --> 00:24:14,226  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Morris, Fiore,
Barbala, and Felder.

405
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:17,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's wrong with this picture?

406
00:24:17,703 --> 00:24:19,694  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, for one thing

407
00:24:19,772 --> 00:24:22,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fiore said he only
knew Barbala by reputation.

408
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:25,774  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Right. So whywould he say that?

409
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:27,778  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't know.

410
00:24:29,782 --> 00:24:30,908  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hmm...

411
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:33,941  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What?

412
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:37,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's a page gone
from Morris' homicide file.

413
00:24:38,023 --> 00:24:40,253  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wonderwhere it could be.

414
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:42,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is there
a log sheet?

415
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:43,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Should be.

416
00:24:44,797 --> 00:24:46,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah.

417
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:52,467  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
"Tony Fiore..."
Checked out this afternoon.

418
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:01,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mrs. Fiore, we're sorry
for the early hour

419
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but is your husband home?

420
00:25:03,782 --> 00:25:05,306  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, he's not.

421
00:25:05,384 --> 00:25:07,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He never came home
last night.

422
00:25:07,786 --> 00:25:09,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maywe come in?

423
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:32,768  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, Scully.

424
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:41,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look familiar?

425
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:46,489  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mrs. Fiore:
He said he was working a double shift.

426
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:48,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But when I called
the precinct

427
00:25:48,827 --> 00:25:51,489  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
he wasn't scheduled.

428
00:25:51,563 --> 00:25:54,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It'sjust not like him
not to call.

429
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:58,027  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Does your husband have any family
or close friends in the area

430
00:25:58,103 --> 00:26:00,628  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
that he might go to
ifhe were in trouble?

431
00:26:04,209 --> 00:26:07,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I've been on the phone
all night.

432
00:26:07,145 --> 00:26:09,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is he in any trouble?

433
00:26:09,147 --> 00:26:11,081  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mrs. Fiore,
did your husband ever mention

434
00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:13,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
a detective by the name
of Rudy Barbala

435
00:26:13,352 --> 00:26:17,812  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
or an ex-police officer
named Leon Felder?

436
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:20,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't think so.

437
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:22,422  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Someoneyou might have
had dinnerwith once...

438
00:26:22,494 --> 00:26:24,428  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
a friend ofTony's from work

439
00:26:24,496 --> 00:26:27,021  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
a nameyou can't remember--
anything?

440
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:29,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We don't normally socialize
with other cops.

441
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:31,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mrs. Fiore,
I couldn't help noticing

442
00:26:31,904 --> 00:26:34,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
your origami collection.

443
00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:36,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Did you do theseyourself?

444
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:38,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, no, not me.

445
00:26:38,143 --> 00:26:39,940  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, that was Charlie's hobby.

446
00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:40,774  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Charlie?

447
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My first husband.

448
00:26:43,181 --> 00:26:45,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He was born inJapan.

449
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,408  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
His father
was stationed there.

450
00:26:46,485 --> 00:26:50,216  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not Charlie Morris,
Tony's ex-partner?

451
00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:52,587  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah.

452
00:26:52,658 --> 00:26:55,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I was waiting for him
to come home too

453
00:26:56,061 --> 00:26:58,894  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
nineyears ago,just like this.

454
00:26:58,964 --> 00:27:03,924  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He was working on a whole set,
you know, from the painting.

455
00:27:04,002 --> 00:27:07,802  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The only animal he never got to
was the giraffe.

456
00:27:07,906 --> 00:27:10,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
See, right there
behind the zebra?

457
00:27:13,045 --> 00:27:15,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Michelle is eightyears old.
That means she was conceived

458
00:27:15,547 --> 00:27:17,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
at roughly the same time
that Officer Morris was killed.

459
00:27:17,983 --> 00:27:20,144  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do me a favor, Mulder.

460
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:21,708  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let me say it--
reincarnation.

461
00:27:21,787 --> 00:27:23,618  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Metempsychosis,
transmigration

462
00:27:23,689 --> 00:27:25,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
reembodiment--
call it whatyou will.

463
00:27:25,424 --> 00:27:27,085  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All based on
the coincidence

464
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:29,127  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
that Michelle Bishop
and Officer Morris

465
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:31,185  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
both practice the obscure art
ofpaper folding?

466
00:27:31,263 --> 00:27:32,924  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What about
the composite drawing

467
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:34,932  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and the dolls,
and the fact

468
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,059  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
that Michelle was witness to two deaths
that can be tied to Charlie Morris?

469
00:27:37,135 --> 00:27:39,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So what, you think he's back,
like Peter Proud

470
00:27:39,137 --> 00:27:40,365  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to avenge his murder?

471
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:42,373  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's not
so farfetched, Scully.

472
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:44,705  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Reincarnation is a basic tenet
ofmany major religions.

473
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:48,143  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That still doesn't explain
how an eight-year-old girl

474
00:27:48,213 --> 00:27:50,340  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
can kill two grown men.

475
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:52,542  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, individuals with
strong past-life memories

476
00:27:52,617 --> 00:27:54,778  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
often exhibit enhanced
psychic abilities--

477
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:56,616  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
E.S.P., telekinesis...

478
00:27:56,688 --> 00:27:58,212  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So where
does that leave us?

479
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,814  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
One short step away

480
00:27:59,891 --> 00:28:02,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
from proving the preexistence
ofthe human soul.

481
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:04,762  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Doctor:
On the count offive

482
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,923  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
tell me where
you are now.

483
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:11,800  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
One, two, three,
four, five.

484
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:16,407  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Doyou know
whereyou are?

485
00:28:16,508 --> 00:28:18,806  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Yes.
- Where?

486
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,344  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tell me whereyou are.

487
00:28:21,413 --> 00:28:22,641  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
At home.

488
00:28:22,748 --> 00:28:25,012  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What time ofday is it?

489
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,948  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nighttime.

490
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:28,748  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And how old areyou?

491
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,380  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Twenty-four.

492
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:34,425  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No! We can't!

493
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:35,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We can't do this!

494
00:28:35,594 --> 00:28:36,526  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's wrong!

495
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:37,619  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's wrong?

496
00:28:37,696 --> 00:28:38,856  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What can'tyou do?

497
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,692  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's all right.

498
00:28:42,768 --> 00:28:44,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You can trust me.

499
00:28:44,102 --> 00:28:45,729  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No! I can't.
I can't.

500
00:28:45,804 --> 00:28:46,771  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You can trust me.

501
00:28:46,838 --> 00:28:47,862  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can't!
I can't!

502
00:28:47,939 --> 00:28:49,770  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is dangerous
and irresponsible.

503
00:28:49,841 --> 00:28:51,809  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Dr. Spitz has conducted
hundreds ofthese sessions...

504
00:28:51,877 --> 00:28:55,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ifthis continues, you could
push Michelle deeper into withdrawal.

505
00:28:55,414 --> 00:28:58,383  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is it any more dangerous than
pumping her full ofThorazine?

506
00:28:58,483 --> 00:29:01,179  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They're killing me!
They're killing me!

507
00:29:01,253 --> 00:29:02,584  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's enough.

508
00:29:02,654 --> 00:29:04,087  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mulder:
Please, Mrs. Bishop.

509
00:29:04,156 --> 00:29:05,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No! No! No!

510
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:07,816  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's okay. It's okay.

511
00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:11,385  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's over. It's over.
It's over.

512
00:29:17,235 --> 00:29:18,668  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Theyjust left.

513
00:29:18,737 --> 00:29:20,170  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We almost had it, Scully.

514
00:29:20,238 --> 00:29:21,136  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We were right there.

515
00:29:21,206 --> 00:29:22,264  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I know.

516
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,331  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We'll have to try it again.

517
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:26,400  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mrs. Bishop
won't go for that.

518
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:28,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not in this lifetime anyway.

519
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,507  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, we have
to change her mind.

520
00:29:30,615 --> 00:29:31,946  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How? And to what end?

521
00:29:32,017 --> 00:29:33,382  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I mean, what exactly

522
00:29:33,452 --> 00:29:36,182  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
doyou hope to discover
by all this?

523
00:29:36,254 --> 00:29:37,380  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The truth.

524
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:39,924  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What really happened
to Charlie Morris.

525
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:42,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We'll find the truth
when we find Fiore.

526
00:29:42,861 --> 00:29:46,194  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ifwe find Fiore,
and ifhe's still alive.

527
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:48,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Scully, you saw
what happened in there.

528
00:29:49,067 --> 00:29:51,968  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What I saw was
some traumatized little girl

529
00:29:52,037 --> 00:29:54,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
who, for no apparent reason

530
00:29:54,272 --> 00:29:58,606  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
has some connection
to Charlie Morris.

531
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,907  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All evidence suggests that
Michelle Bishop is Charlie Morris.

532
00:30:02,013 --> 00:30:04,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Short ofher
growing a moustache

533
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:07,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
how much more apparent does it
have to become foryou to accept it?

534
00:30:09,187 --> 00:30:13,647  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Okay. Let'sjust say that,
by some small miracle

535
00:30:13,725 --> 00:30:15,818  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
you manage to convince
Michelle's mother

536
00:30:15,894 --> 00:30:17,828  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and the next hypno-regression
provides you with everything

537
00:30:17,896 --> 00:30:19,830  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
you could possibly hope for.

538
00:30:19,898 --> 00:30:22,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No grandjury
is going to listen

539
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:23,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to that kind
oftestimony.

540
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:27,600  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We still will not have
an actionable case.

541
00:30:40,952 --> 00:30:42,886  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The inconclusive results

542
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:44,888  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
of Michelle's
past-life regression

543
00:30:44,956 --> 00:30:46,890  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
do not shake
my basic beliefin hypnosis

544
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:49,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
as a tool
for psychological healing.

545
00:30:49,861 --> 00:30:51,886  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Whether or not
it offers us definitive proof

546
00:30:51,963 --> 00:30:54,625  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
ofprevious lifetimes
is another matter.

547
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:56,826  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
However,
in this particular case

548
00:30:56,902 --> 00:31:00,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
all other explanations
seem to be even more wanting.

549
00:31:00,906 --> 00:31:02,601  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Dr. Spitz:
How old areyou?

550
00:31:02,674 --> 00:31:04,904  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Twenty-four.

551
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,137  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No! We can't!
We can't do this!

552
00:31:07,245 --> 00:31:08,177  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's wrong!

553
00:31:08,246 --> 00:31:09,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's wrong?

554
00:31:09,548 --> 00:31:10,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What can'tyou do?

555
00:31:10,982 --> 00:31:13,644  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(Rewinding Tape)

556
00:31:13,718 --> 00:31:15,652  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And how old areyou?

557
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Twenty-four.

558
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:19,417  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No! We can't...

559
00:31:19,491 --> 00:31:23,291  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(Rewinding)

560
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:25,522  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Twenty-four.

561
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:38,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, no, l...

562
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:41,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I-l want to be here
in case he shows up.

563
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah, thanks again.

564
00:31:43,582 --> 00:31:46,847  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll, uh... I'll call you
the minute I hear anything.

565
00:31:46,918 --> 00:31:49,409  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Okay, yeah. Okay. Bye-bye.

566
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:12,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(KnockAt Door)

567
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:14,606  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tony!

568
00:32:19,584 --> 00:32:21,347  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tony?

569
00:32:23,922 --> 00:32:24,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tony?

570
00:32:57,455 --> 00:32:59,685  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I checked the windup profiles.
They're up to speed.

571
00:32:59,758 --> 00:33:01,885  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Which means?

572
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,862  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Whatever this image is, it was recorded
in that room with the girl.

573
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,330  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How is that
possible?

574
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There was a documented case
in the early '70s

575
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:12,603  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
ofa man from Porlock, Ohio

576
00:33:12,671 --> 00:33:14,605  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
who could infuence
undeveloped film.

577
00:33:14,673 --> 00:33:18,302  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He could create shapes
on the negative from his mind.

578
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:21,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't know how much
ofthis noise I can clean up.

579
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:26,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It depends on the strength
ofthe latent image.

580
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:27,443  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(Door Opens)

581
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,384  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I tracked him down.

582
00:33:29,454 --> 00:33:31,388  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's retired in Palm Beach.

583
00:33:31,456 --> 00:33:33,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You were right, Agent Scully.

584
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:35,853  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He backed up
all his records on disk.

585
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:38,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pathologists are paranoid
by nature.

586
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,825  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, he faxed me
the missing page

587
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:42,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
from the autopsy report.

588
00:33:42,634 --> 00:33:44,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Great.

589
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:46,097  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, apparently

590
00:33:46,171 --> 00:33:49,504  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Charlie Morris did not die
as a result ofhis wounds.

591
00:33:49,574 --> 00:33:52,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It says here
there's a frothing offuid

592
00:33:52,344 --> 00:33:53,868  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
in the respiratory tract.

593
00:33:53,978 --> 00:33:56,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That indicates
death by drowning.

594
00:33:56,147 --> 00:33:58,047  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He was drowned
and then mutilated

595
00:33:58,116 --> 00:34:00,778  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to make it look
like a signature execution?

596
00:34:00,852 --> 00:34:01,944  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Dr. Yamaguchi said

597
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,215  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
that there were no signs
ofsubmersion

598
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:06,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
such as goose skin
orwrinkled fesh

599
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:08,586  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
except for around
the face and head.

600
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,093  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's right.

601
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:12,095  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Suggesting that he was killed

602
00:34:12,163 --> 00:34:14,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
in either a bathtub
or a toilet.

603
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:18,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Except--
- Except forwhat?

604
00:34:18,303 --> 00:34:21,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The marked bradycardia.

605
00:34:21,506 --> 00:34:24,373  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It indicates
a raised plasma sodium level.

606
00:34:24,476 --> 00:34:27,570  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He was killed in sea water.

607
00:34:46,931 --> 00:34:48,728  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Anita!

608
00:34:51,035 --> 00:34:52,696  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Anita!

609
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:57,501  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tony!

610
00:34:57,609 --> 00:34:59,668  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tony, what's going on?
Where haveyou been?

611
00:34:59,778 --> 00:35:01,643  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Listen, I know
something's going on.

612
00:35:01,713 --> 00:35:03,647  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I need you to listen
to me right now.

613
00:35:03,715 --> 00:35:05,649  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go upstairs
and pack a bag.

614
00:35:05,717 --> 00:35:08,242  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why? What kind
oftrouble areyou in?

615
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:11,288  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I think someone's
trying to kill me.

616
00:35:11,356 --> 00:35:13,415  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Who?
- I don't know.

617
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:15,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Whywould anybody
want to kill you?

618
00:35:15,627 --> 00:35:19,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tell me
what's going on.

619
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:23,162  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Will you pleasejust do
what I'm asking you?!

620
00:35:23,234 --> 00:35:25,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Please.

621
00:35:25,503 --> 00:35:27,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm your husband,
and I loveyou

622
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:29,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and I need you to trust me
on this, okay?

623
00:35:51,596 --> 00:35:53,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Almost there.

624
00:36:00,071 --> 00:36:03,040  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What I've done is to map
the frequencies ofthe interference.

625
00:36:03,107 --> 00:36:05,371  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Coefficients for sine
on this monitor

626
00:36:05,443 --> 00:36:07,775  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
cosine on that one.

627
00:36:07,846 --> 00:36:10,337  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now, using an algorithm program

628
00:36:10,415 --> 00:36:12,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can remove the frequencies...

629
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Iike this.

630
00:36:13,985 --> 00:36:15,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Presto.

631
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,987  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What the hell?

632
00:36:26,898 --> 00:36:28,627  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mulder, what is it?

633
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,691  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You said salt water, right?

634
00:36:30,802 --> 00:36:33,293  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Right. So?

635
00:36:33,404 --> 00:36:35,531  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Charlie Morris
was drowned

636
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,508  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
in his own tropical fish tank,
and that's the last thing
he saw before he died.

637
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:44,446  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We better hope Michelle Bishop
is at home tucked in bed.

638
00:36:50,054 --> 00:36:51,578  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tony...

639
00:36:53,892 --> 00:36:57,191  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Somebody left this
on our doorstep tonight.

640
00:36:58,796 --> 00:37:00,525  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Doyou know who?

641
00:37:03,434 --> 00:37:05,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Answer me, Tony!

642
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,948  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You stay here
and keep the door closed.

643
00:38:11,035 --> 00:38:12,969  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Anita:
Tony, areyou all right?

644
00:38:17,742 --> 00:38:19,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tony, answer me.

645
00:38:50,174 --> 00:38:52,142  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(Crashing Noise)

646
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,612  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tony.

647
00:38:58,683 --> 00:39:00,810  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tony, please.

648
00:39:00,885 --> 00:39:02,284  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who's there?

649
00:39:02,353 --> 00:39:03,650  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's happening?

650
00:39:03,721 --> 00:39:05,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(Crashing Continues)

651
00:39:19,804 --> 00:39:21,294  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mulder!

652
00:39:43,695 --> 00:39:45,925  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They said theywerejust going
to talk toyou.

653
00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:48,761  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Talk some sense
intoyou.

654
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:51,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What was I supposed to do, huh?

655
00:39:54,372 --> 00:39:56,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All you had to do was
take the money, man!

656
00:39:56,507 --> 00:39:59,101  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why didn'tyou
just take the money?!

657
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:09,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(Screaming)

658
00:40:19,964 --> 00:40:21,932  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's going on, Tony?

659
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:24,024  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go check upstairs.

660
00:40:34,479 --> 00:40:36,106  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Michelle!

661
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:39,206  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This won't make right
what happened.

662
00:40:42,286 --> 00:40:43,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can't get out.

663
00:40:43,354 --> 00:40:44,651  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who's there?

664
00:40:44,722 --> 00:40:46,815  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can't get out.

665
00:40:59,203 --> 00:41:01,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tony?!

666
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tony!

667
00:41:10,148 --> 00:41:12,844  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tony...

668
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:15,010  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm sorry.

669
00:41:17,388 --> 00:41:19,322  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I knew what they did
to Charlie.

670
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:26,057  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I was a part ofit,
and I never said anything.

671
00:41:28,132 --> 00:41:30,191  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I couldn't.

672
00:41:30,268 --> 00:41:32,964  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, no.

673
00:41:35,506 --> 00:41:37,940  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I just wanted
to take care ofyou.

674
00:41:38,009 --> 00:41:42,537  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who else would have
taken care ofyou?

675
00:42:12,677 --> 00:42:14,941  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Please... Please don't hurt him
anymore.

676
00:43:03,794 --> 00:43:08,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mulder:

after the fact

680
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,304  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
grand larceny,
and obstruction ofjustice.

681
00:43:18,376 --> 00:43:20,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The deaths
of Detective Rudy Barbala

682

683
00:43:22,513 --> 00:43:24,481  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
are being ruled as accidental

684
00:43:24,548 --> 00:43:27,210  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
although their complicity in
the murder ofOfficer Charlie Morris

685
00:43:27,285 --> 00:43:30,015  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

definitively established.

686
00:43:30,087 --> 00:43:33,454  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No charges were brought
against Michelle Bishop

687
00:43:33,524 --> 00:43:35,651  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
who, today,
took her first swimming lesson.

688
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,287  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She claims no memory
ofthe preceding events

689
00:43:39,397 --> 00:43:42,366  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and both her mother and Dr. Braun
have denied my request

690
00:43:42,466 --> 00:43:44,764  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
for a second
past-life regression.
