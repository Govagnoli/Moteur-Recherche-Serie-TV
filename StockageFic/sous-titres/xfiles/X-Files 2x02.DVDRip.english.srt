1
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,669
<i>(sailors shout in Russian)</i>

2
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,553
Argh!

3
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,511
<i>(shouting)</i>

4
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,431
<i>(man #1) Dave can set it up,</i>
<i>but the cost sounds a bit rich.</i>

5
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,559
<i>(man #2) If he's putting it together,</i>
<i>you'd be a fool to pass it up.</i>

6
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,949
<i>I hear you. I just...</i>

7
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,430
<i>You just what? You wanna take a dip,</i>
<i>you gotta test the water.</i>

8
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,798
- <i>You just don't wanna get wet.</i>
- <i>No, man. Dippage is sacred.</i>

9
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,551
<i>Dippage is sacred.</i>

10
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,994
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah.

11
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,914
You're relieved from your assignment.
Agent Bozoff will take over.

12
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,189
You've got a flight to catch in 45 minutes.

13
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,352
- Where am I going?
- Murder case. Newark, New Jersey.

14
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,396
Treat yourself.

15
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,309
Your contact in Newark
is a Detective Norman.

16
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,154
- How'd I draw the assignment?
- Assistant Director Skinner requested you.

17
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,390
Skinner requested <i>me?!</i>

18
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,796
- Mulder, FBI.
- My forensics team's just wrapping up.

19
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,952
We left the body where we found it.
Kenny!

20
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,788
This is one case I'm gonna be
happy to turn over to you guys.

21
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,549
<i>(Detective Norman)</i> Watch yourself.

22
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,719
Yeah. Wouldn't wanna step in anything.

23
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,110
They say it cuts the smell if you
don't breathe through your mouth.

24
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,760
<i>(Mulder)</i> They lied.

25
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,719
- Who found the body?
- Sanitation worker.

26
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,234
Looks like it's been here a while.

27
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,949
- Any ID?
- No. Not much to go on, either.

28
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,474
Front side is pretty much eaten away.

29
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,519
- Would you like us to turn him over?
- No, I'll take your word on that.

30
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,276
Hey, Agent Mulder!
What should we do with the body?

31
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,354
Wrap it up and send it to the FBI,
care of Assistant Director Skinner!

32
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,195
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

33
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,872
I need to speak to him.

34
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,952
Mr Skinner is unavailable.
If you'd take a seat...

35
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,431
Will you tell him that I'm here
and I need to speak to him... now?

36
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,197
Certainly.

37
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,711
Mr Skinner, I'm very sorry to interrupt,
but Agent Mulder is demanding to see you.

38
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,439
- Is there a problem, Agent Mulder?
- Yeah, there is.

39
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,715
Then make an appointment.

40
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,872
That's hard when you're
up to your ass in raw sewage...

41
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,394
...on another meaningless assignment.

42
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,029
- Excuse me?
- What's next? Scrubbing bathroom floors?

43
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,078
- You're out of line, Agent Mulder.
- So I gathered.

44
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,752
Fine.

45
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,832
Come into my office, Agent Mulder. Please.

46
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,357
Would you inform the room...

47
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,433
...as to why you regard your case
in New Jersey as meaningless?

48
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,830
It's a simple drugland body dump...

49
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,117
...not the type of case
the FBI wastes time or manpower on.

50
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,157
Given your recent history, you're not one
to judge what is or is not a waste of time.

51
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,996
- Sir, my work on the X-Files...
- The X-Files have been closed, Agent Mulder.

52
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,435
You will carry out new assignments...

53
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,116
...and investigate them to the best
of your ability. Is that not clear?

54
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,156
Yeah.

55
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,552
And I'll be anticipating your field reports
on your current homicide case.

56
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,631
Thank you.

57
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,715
Is this seat taken?

58
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,156
No. But I should warn you,
I'm experiencing violent impulses.

59
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,232
Well, I'm armed, so I'll take my chances.

60
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,190
I hear you really endeared yourself
to Assistant Director Skinner today.

61
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,868
Sometimes it's hard to smile when they
ask you to bend down and grab your ankles.

62
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,790
It's not as if you've ever tried
to fit into the programme.

63
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,472
No.

64
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,072
No, I've been thinking a lot about that lately.

65
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,109
- I've been thinking about leaving.
- The Bureau?

66
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,838
What would you do?

67
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,878
Pursue my work in the
paranormal, somehow.

68
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,235
You could request a transfer to Quantico.
Come back to the behavioural science unit.

69
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,354
They don't want us working together, Scully.

70
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,034
And that's the only reason
I can think of to stay.

71
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,714
What about this case you're working on?

72
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,190
- It's a zero.
- Where's the body?

73
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,429
In our forensics lab.
Look, I know what you're trying to do.

74
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,630
Maybe I can request to do the autopsy.

75
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,510
It's an exercise. Skinner is just
rubbing my nose in this one.

76
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,636
There's nothing to it.

77
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,837
There's a dead body, isn't there?

78
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,239
Oh!

79
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,317
Examination and autopsy of
John Doe number 1-0-1-3-5-6.

80
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,790
Case number DP1-1-2-1-4-8.

81
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,872
Special Agent Fox Mulder, field investigator.

82
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,788
Body is an adult male with
advanced tissue decomposition...

83
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,475
...weighing 165 pounds <i>in extremis...</i>

84
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,588
...69 inches in length.

85
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,154
Intact skin is mottled and discoloured...

86
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,677
...due to submergence in and exposure to
a highly bacterial environment.

87
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,354
Cause and time of death...

88
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,153
...unknown.

89
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,391
Possible identifying mark on right forearm.

90
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,034
Body cavities appear normal.

91
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,549
Interior organs intact...

92
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,192
...consistent in rate of decomposition.

93
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,389
Removing the ribcage.

94
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,232
Condition of heart and lungs are good.

95
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,234
No sign of thrombi,
natural or degenerate diseases.

96
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,312
Indicate victim was probably a young adult.

97
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,678
The liver shows some nodular hardening...

98
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,320
...consistent with incipient alcoholism.

99
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,159
Oh, God!

100
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,628
- It's on the way!
- Got it!

101
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,952
OK.

102
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,192
Need a big piece of 30-gauge
and some baling wire.

103
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,914
I gotta go back up top for the screen.

104
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,119
Frank! Help!

105
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,914
Frank! Frank!

106
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,517
Frank!

107
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,320
Frank! Hurry!

108
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,751
Hold on!

109
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,434
- Frank!
- Come on!

110
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,714
Frank!

111
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,792
Hold on till I tie the line! Hold on!

112
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,159
Pull up, come on! Come on! Come on!

113
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,397
Pull up!

114
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,992
My God!

115
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,275
I'm gonna get help!

116
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,148
I'm gonna give you a tetanus booster,
just as a precaution.

117
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,955
I'd be happy if you just give me something
to get this taste out of my mouth.

118
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,917
Let me take a look.

119
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,228
Ah.

120
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,320
- Any trouble swallowing?
- Uh-uh.

121
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,071
It'll go away.

122
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,789
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah.

123
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,559
Newark PD referred me to you.
I'm surprised the FBI is involved.

124
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,111
- Is there something here I should know?
- I don't know. Maybe you can tell me.

125
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,552
He's a sanitation worker. He claims he was
attacked by something down in the sewer.

126
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,757
- Attacked? By what?
- We've been unable to determine.

127
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,356
I thought it was a bogus disability claim,
but he appears to be telling the truth.

128
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,557
- What's his condition?
- He's in satisfactory health.

129
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,953
I've given him a heavy course of antibiotics,
and we're checking for hepatitis.

130
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,918
He does have a strange wound on his back.

131
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,712
- What kind of wound?
- It could be some kind of bacterial infection.

132
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,156
Frankly, I can't say
I've ever seen anything like it.

133
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,355
- This is Agent Mulder of the FBI.
- Any idea what attacked you?

134
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,194
- I've been thinking it might've been a python.
- A python?

135
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:41,593
Or a boa constrictor. Somebody probably
flushed their pet snake down the toilet.

136
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,236
We found an alligator in the sewer
a couple of years ago.

137
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,711
Stronger than hell, I'll tell you that.
Clamped onto me like a vice.

138
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,709
It almost looks like a bite.

139
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,189
- <i>(phone rings)</i>
- Excuse me.

140
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,154
- Mulder.
- <i>Mulder, it's me. I need to see you.</i>

141
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,390
<i>I've got something you should know about.</i>

142
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,950
- What is it?
- Some kind of parasite in your John Doe.

143
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,759
I should know more by the time you get here.

144
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,919
I'm in Jersey. I should be taking
the shuttle in about an hour.

145
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,719
Can I get outta here? I'd like to go home.

146
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,677
- <i>(phone rings)</i>
- Excuse me.

147
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,275
- <i>Scully, this is a bad time for me to talk.</i>
- <i>(man)</i> Mr Mulder?

148
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,950
Yeah?

149
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,397
I think you should know...
you have a friend at the FBI.

150
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,150
Who is this?

151
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,070
Agent Mulder? If you don't have any more
questions, I'm gonna release this man.

152
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,151
OK. Go ahead.

153
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,309
Close the door.

154
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,635
It's called <i>Turbellaria,</i> commonly
known as a fluke, or flatworm.

155
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,836
This was living inside the body?

156
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,948
It had attached itself to the bile duct
and was feeding off the liver.

157
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,189
Lovely!

158
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,831
Believe it or not, some 40 million
people are infected worldwide.

159
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,277
This isn't where you tell me
some terrible story about sushi, is it?

160
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,273
Maybe you'd rather hear what you
can catch from a nice rare steak.

161
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,557
So, what? The murder weapon
was a top sirloin?

162
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,952
Flukes are endemic in unsanitary conditions.

163
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,919
It's more likely that the victim
contracted it down inside the sewer.

164
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,390
- Before or after he died?
- I don't know.

165
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,113
My sources say it's unlikely
a single parasite could have killed him.

166
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,513
He was a young man. But the weird thing is,
there's no other discernible cause of death.

167
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,912
How do these parasites attach themselves?

168
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,160
They have what's called a scolex,
a sucker-like mouth with four hooking spikes.

169
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,754
- Anything like this?
- Where'd you get that?

170
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,753
Something attacked a workman
in a New Jersey sewer this morning.

171
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,276
- And you're asking me if this is from a fluke?
- Could it be?

172
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,318
The scolex is a tiny organ.
This is a huge bite mark.

173
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,750
- How big can these things get?
- Mulder, I...

174
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,958
I'm sorry.

175
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,952
It felt like old times there for a second.

176
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,749
Flatworms are what are known
as obligate endoparasites.

177
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,229
They live inside of the host...

178
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,233
...entering the body through
the ingestion of larvae or eggs.

179
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,551
They are not creatures that
go around attacking people.

180
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,518
That's good. I didn't wanna tell Skinner...

181
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,229
...his murder suspect was
a giant bloodsucking worm.

182
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,594
No.

183
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,552
Well, at the very least, this'll be interesting
to the Newark Department of Sanitation.

184
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,355
Look, I don't know who you shared
our conversation with the other night, but...

185
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,910
...I'd prefer it if you didn't
try to launch a campaign for me.

186
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,514
- Excuse me?
- I don't know who you talked to.

187
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,912
- I didn't talk to anybody.
- Somebody told me I had a friend at the FBI.

188
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,189
Look, Mulder, I... I don't know what to say.
But I... I wouldn't betray a confidence.

189
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,148
The city runs on different systems...

190
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,277
...some new, some built
at the turn of the century.

191
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,955
- Almost as old as Charlie. Right, Charlie?
- Oh, yes, sir.

192
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,597
- What part of the sewer was I in?
- An older section. Big eight-foot tunnels.

193
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,634
It looked more like a catacomb
than a sewer line.

194
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,951
The new sections are concrete pipe,
mostly 24 inches.

195
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,794
And all the sewage
comes through this plant?

196
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,476
560,000 people a day call my office
on the porcelain telephone.

197
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,314
Have you ever seen one of these?

198
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,919
It looks like a big old worm.

199
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,310
It's called a fluke. It came
from the body in the sewer.

200
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,112
Wouldn't surprise me. No telling what's been
breeding down there in the last 100 years.

201
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,391
<i>(splashing)</i>

202
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,358

203
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,511

Ray here.

205
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,910
Charlie, slow down.

206
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,637
I'm backflushing the system. It's in there.

207
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,917
- What is it?
- I don't know. Itjust swam right past me.

208
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,797
There it is.

209
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:18,710
<i>Turbellarian flatworms are carnivorous</i>
<i>scavengers, less than 3cm in length...</i>

210
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,918
<i>... found in fresh and sea water.</i>
<i>They are hermaphroditic...</i>

211
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,154
<i>... with complex reproductive systems,</i>
<i>capable of internal fertilisation.</i>

212
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,074
<i>Many species require more than</i>
<i>one host to complete a life cycle.</i>

213
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,870
<i>Although the wound on the sanitation worker</i>
<i>suggests scolex attachment...</i>

214
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,829
<i>... the sheer size of the wound precludes</i>
<i>involvement of the common fluke worm.</i>

215
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,628
<i>(phone rings)</i>

216
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,635
- Scully.
- <i>Scully, it's me.</i>

217
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,915
- <i>You know that fluke you caught?</i>
- Yeah.

218
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,070
<i>It must've been the runt of the litter.</i>

219
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,270
I don't see it.

220
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,033
There it is. Tucked away in the
far corner behind the pipes.

221
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,160
- Oh, my God.
- I don't know if you can see...

222
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,710
...but it has no sex organs. It's genderless.

223
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,156
Platyhelminthes are often hermaphroditic.

224
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,037
Mulder, this is amazing!

225
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,671
Its vestigial features seem parasitic,
but it has primate physiology.

226
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,035
- Where did it come from?
- I don't know.

227
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,592
But I'll have to tell Skinner that his suspect
is a giant bloodsucking worm after all.

228
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,315
All we're missing is the identity
of the body in the sewer.

229
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,757
He was a Russian.
An engineer on a cargo freighter.

230
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,994
He had a tattoo on his forearm. I didn't
make the connection until I detected...

231
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,835
...that that was the name Dmitri,
spelled in Cyrillic lettering.

232
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,718
How did you make the connection at all?

233
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,716
Somebody shoved <i>this</i> under my door.

234
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,950
I guess you really do
have a friend in the FBI.

235
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,711
And, Mulder...

236
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,556
...when you see Skinner
to hand in your field report...

237
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,916
...I know that it's your decision,
but I hope that you know...

238
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,994
...that I'd consider it more than
a professional loss if you decided to leave.

239
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,639
Everything looks in order.

240
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,910
Is something wrong, Agent Mulder?

241
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,516
That's an unexpected response,
considering the bizarre nature of the case.

242
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,272
And of the suspect.

243
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,875
The strangeness of the criminal
and the crime are not lost on me.

244
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,830
I had my reaction to them in a conversation
about how to process the suspect.

245
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,514
<i>This</i> meeting is to evaluate your work.

246
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,269
There's no way you'll prosecute this.

247
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,593
The Justice Department wants the suspect
transferred to a psychiatric institution.

248
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,229
This is not a man, it's a monster!
You can't put it in an institution.

249
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,312
What <i>do</i> you do with it, Agent Mulder?
Put it in a zoo?

250
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,595
It killed two people.

251
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,959
Two?

252
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:02,553
The sanitation worker who was attacked was
found dead at home as a result of his injuries.

253
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,720
You know, you had a pair of agents
that could've handled a case like this.

254
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,319
Agent Scully and I might've been able
to save his life, but you shut us down.

255
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,391
I know.

256
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,754
This should have been an X-File.

257
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,715
We all take our orders
from someone, Agent Mulder.

258
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,676
That'll be all.

259
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,951
You're secure!

260
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,999
This is vehicle 49-40 requesting
immediate backup and assistance.

261
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,150
<i>Roger, 49-40.</i>

262

<i>(blockage in pipe)</i>

- What have you got?
- A dead marshal and an escaped prisoner.

266
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,116
Other than that, bupkis.

267
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,395
We got a police line in a two-mile radius.

268
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,871
Watch any access to the sewer system.
It's gonna try to get back underground.

269
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,279
<i>(phone rings)</i>

270
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,519
- Mulder.
- Mr Mulder, I'll make this brief.

271
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,798
<i>Success in your current</i>
<i>assignment is imperative.</i>

272
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,714
- Who am I speaking to?
- <i>Are you hearing me, Mr Mulder?</i>

273
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,110
Yes. Why is it imperative?

274
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,477
Reinstatement of the X-Files
must be undeniable.

275
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,712
- <i>Canine unit Six-Four, copy.</i>
- Six-Four, copy.

276
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,874
<i>We're at a campsite a quarter-mile from you.</i>
<i>The dogs tracked a scent to a chemical toilet.</i>

277
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,838
- <i>I looked inside, but it's empty.</i>
- The tanker.

278
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,629
- Hold on, Six-Four.
- What if he's on the tanker truck?

279
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,512
The company that owns the truck
doesn't keep detailed service records.

280
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,594
They had five trucks out this morning.
Three of them have deposited their loads.

281
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,389
- So he could have been here and gone.
- If he hasn't, he will be.

282
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,756
- And every tanker dumps its load here?
- It's a state law.

283
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,116
- Everything's processed through this plant?
- Yep.

284
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,192
- Then what?
- It empties through an outlet pipe...

285
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,316
...about five miles out to sea.

286
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,472
- Could it have escaped through that pipe?
- Doubtful.

287
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:14,078
The system's full of filters. Nothing bigger
than your little finger's gonna get through.

288
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,994
If it's here, it's going to be trapped here.

289
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,389
I guess all we can do is wait.

290
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,791
<i>(phone rings)</i>

291
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,510
- Mulder.
- <i>It's me. Where are you?</i>

292
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,070
The treatment plant. I thought it
might be back in the system.

293
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,754
- <i>How?</i>
- Forget it. It's stupid.

294
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,435
- Well, you won't like what I have to tell you.
- <i>Why not?</i>

295
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,954
It hadn't occurred to me, but the fluke in the
corpse might have been an incubating larva.

296
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,190
This creature, or whatever it is,
transmits its eggs or larvae through its bite.

297
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,236
- You mean it's trying to reproduce?
- It's looking for hosts.

298
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,394
It attacks because the victims' bodies
provide generative nourishment.

299
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,710
- Mulder...
- <i>Yeah.</i>

300
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,150
- If it finds a new host...
- I know. It could multiply.

301
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:46,030
Agent Mulder! Linesman spotting
something down in a section of pipe!

302
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,031
Where?

303
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,317
- Here.
- That's near where we found the first body.

304
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,278
Right. Except this is
an old overflow system...

305
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,158
...that dumps into the harbour
during heavy rainfall.

306
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,073
That must be where it got into the system.

307
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,633
It's working its way back out to sea.

308
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,193
That's the overflow pipe. It leads
to another vault like this one...

309
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,397
...then about three quarters
of a mile to the sea.

310
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,074
Let's see if we can get that gate closed.

311
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,629
It's rusted in position.

312
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,030
Let's see if I can get some leverage here.

313
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,832
Agh!

314
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,997
Hey!

315
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,272
- Goddammit!
- You all right?

316
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,590
Yeah. I... I lost my glasses.

317
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,515
- Give me your hand!
- Get me outta here!

318
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,598
Grab it!

319
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,514

But I should warn you,
I may reek a bit of the sewer.

00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,308
Success in our work is imperative, Scully.

330
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,154
Reinstatement of the X-Files
must be undeniable.

331
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,471
- That came from Skinner?!
- No.

332
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,553
We have a friend in the FBI.

333
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,158
I thought you might be interested in the lab
results on the biology of the fluke larva.

334
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,316
Dissection and analysis indicates...

335
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,790
...reproductive and physiological
cross-traiting...

336
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,997
...resulting in a sort of
quasi-vertebrate human.

337
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,674
Human?

338
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:30,471
Yes, but still capable of spontaneous
regeneration, like any fluke or flatworm.

339
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,117
How does that happen?

340
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,839
Radiation. Abnormal cell fusion.

341
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,912
The suppression of natural
genetic processes.

342
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,396
Mulder, nature didn't make this thing. <i>We</i> did.

343
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,158
I know these.

344
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,673
These are from Chernobyl.

345
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,594
That creature came off of a
decommissioned Russian freighter...

346
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,912
...that was used in the disposal of
salvage material from the meltdown.

347
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,477
It was born in a... in a primordial
soup of radioactive sewage.

348
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,438
You know, they say three species
disappear off the planet every day.

349
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,592
You wonder how many new ones
are being created.

350

351
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,953
<i>(child) I made this!</i>
