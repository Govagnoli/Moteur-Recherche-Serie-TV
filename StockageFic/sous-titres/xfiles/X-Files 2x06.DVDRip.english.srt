3
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,758

4

<i>What the hell is this thing, Mulder?</i>
<i>It's almost as if...</i>

6

I have to get in!

16
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,231
She's not in there.

22
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,551
<i>(Mrs Scully)</i> I knew it would happen this way.

23
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,791
I had this dream
about Dana being taken away.

24
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,551
It's so strange.

25
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,509
I, uh... I was gonna call her...

26
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,993
...but I was afraid I was gonna scare her.

27
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,790
She would've laughed at me, anyway.

28
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,715
She doesn't believe in
that kind of thing, you know.

29
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,159
According to the reports, Agent Scully states
that Duane Barry's propensity for violence...

30
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,789
...is due to brain damage
from a bullet wound in the head.

31
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,474
Is this the operational opinion?

32
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,071
Yes, sir.

33
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,832
Is there another?

34
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,708
He's convinced he's going to be
abducted by aliens.

35
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,510
That by taking someone to the abduction site,
he won't be abducted himself.

36
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,593
That he's following orders
from alien voices in his head?

37
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,394
<i>(Krycek)</i> Yes.

38
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,189
Well, that's an interesting spin
on the Nuremberg defence.

39
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,629
Which explanation do you
subscribe to, Agent Mulder?

40
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,393
There's a question of
how he could've gotten to her.

41
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,914
And you think these alien voices told him?

42
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,232
Scully was carrying a piece of metal that
was removed from Duane Barry's abdomen.

43
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,515
He described it as a tracking device.

44
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,310
Agent Scully... thought that
you had made a miscalculation...

45
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,755
...in Duane Barry's psychosis. Is that true?

46
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,072
Yes. But that still doesn't explain
how he could have found her.

47
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,470
- Where would he be taking her?
- <i>(Mulder)</i> I don't know.

48
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,030
He talked about a mountain.
He wasn't specific about the location.

49
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,159
Well, however he got to her,
he took Agent Scully's car and her weapon.

50
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,756
We all understand the seriousness of this
matter and should proceed ahead quickly.

51

- I'd like to brief them myself.

52

- Go home. You've been up all night.
- Sir, I know Duane Barry.

53
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,237
- I've been in his head. I know how he thinks.
- You're too close to this case!

55
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,474

- That's an order, Agent Mulder.

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,796

"Ascend to the Stars. Skyland Mountain."

- Get your car. Meet me downstairs.

Mountain. I'll hold him off till they locate her.

Wait, here he comes. I'll be in touch.

- I'm fine.

124
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,755
- Well, you haven't slept yet. I have.
- I said I'm fine.

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,590
You know, Chernobyl, Exxon Valdez,
Three Mile Island...

126
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,797
...they were all linked to sleep deprivation.

127
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,158
The department of transportation estimates
that over 190,000 fatal car crashes...

128
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,959
...every year are caused by sleepiness.

129
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,795
Did they estimate how many people are
put to sleep listening to their statistics?

130
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,269
I'm just trying to keep you awake.

131
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,400
Look, if Skinner sends in the whole cavalry,
Duane Barry might go over the edge.

132
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,674
You're right.

133
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,037
If we find him first,
we'll notify the Bureau. All right?

134
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,432
Yeah. You really think
he tracked her down with that implant?

135
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,114
Well, that's the easiest explanation.

136
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,956
- It's also the most implausible.
- Is there another possibility?

137
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,192
Somebody could've given him her address.
I don't know who.

138
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,589
There's our turn-off.

139
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,068
- Have you seen this guy?
- Yeah, he was here.

140
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,199
He's wanted for kidnapping a federal agent.
Did you let him go up on the tram?

141
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,352
It's shut down in the summer.
I told him to take the back road.

142
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,192
- How long ago?
- 45 minutes.

143
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,236
- Did he have a woman with him?
- No.

144
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,914
- How long does it take to drive?
- Over an hour.

145
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,389
- You gotta get me up there.
- No. No way.

146
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,837
We just got done refitting the cable.
It hasn't been tested with passengers yet.

147
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,797
- You have to drive.
- I don't have time.

148
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,156
- You don't have a choice.
- No. <i>You</i> don't have a choice.

149
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,389
I can't stop you from going up there.

150
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,870
But if there's a problem with the cable,
I'm shutting this thing down.

151
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,077
I'm not gonna be responsible for your death.

152
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,429
What are you doing?

153
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,751
Stay here. And whatever happens,
don't let him stop the tram.

154
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,513
You hit your "run" and "up" button
on the panel.

155
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,037
"Speed indicator" controls your ascent.
Now, when you wanna slow down...

156
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,509
Don't crank it faster than 15!

157
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,913
What the hell's he doing? I told him not
to go that fast. Base to car one. Pick up.

158
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,639
- <i>(machinery whirs)</i>
- D'you hear that sound?

159
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,393
At this speed the cable can't hold.

160
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,950
<i>This is base. Please pick up the handset.</i>

161
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,318
<i>Can you hear me?</i>
<i>Slow it to 15 or I'll shut this thing down.</i>

162
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,991
Base to car one. Pick up.

163
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,795
- <i>Base to...</i>
- Go ahead.

164
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,633
- Slow it down.
- You're breaking up.

165
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,837
Slow it down or the cable will jump the tower.

166
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,555
<i>Second tower's coming up.</i>

167
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,995
Slow it through the next tower.

168
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,035
- How close is he?
- He should be up top in a minute.

169
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,951
There he is.

170
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,914
What are you doing? Turn us back on.

171
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,716
Krycek, what's happening down there?
Krycek, do you read me?

172
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,316
<i>Tell the operator to restart the tram.</i>
<i>Hello?</i>

173
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,598
I've got him stalled up there.
I'll hold until you advise.

174
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,275
Is there an emergency system on board?
Can you read me down there?

175
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,555
Can anyone read me?

176
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,519
<i>(car radio)... with scattered rain</i>
<i>and intermittent thunder showers.</i>

177
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,833
<i>Look for highs tomorrow around 65 degrees,</i>
<i>with tonight's low dipping to 48 degrees.</i>

178
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:36,790
<i>That high-pressure ridge has moved</i>

<i>The dollar turned on the foreign exchange</i>

181
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:50,119
<i>Gold dropped almost two dollars, in spite of</i>
<i>the speculation about inflationary trends.</i>

182
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,236
<i>Silver was down 80 cents.</i>

185
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,677
Yes!

186
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,149
- Federal agent!
- Yes!

187
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,711
Yes! Yes! Yes!

188
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,074
- Freeze!
- Yes!

189
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,628
I said freeze! Where is she?

190
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,598
I'm free, you son of a bitches!

191
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,638
You can't touch Duane Barry any more!

192
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,393
Don't move! Don't move!

193
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,075
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Where is she? Where'd you leave her?

194
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,798
- They took her.
- Who?

195
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,351
Them! I told you they were gonna
take somebody else.

196
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,911
They did!

197
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,394
No! No! No!

198
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,871
No! No!

199
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,271
No! No!

200
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,549
No! No!

201
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,197
No! No!

202
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,271
No!

203
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,677
<i>(man) A search and rescue chopper</i>
<i>has found them on the mountain.</i>

204
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,958
<i>We've sent out five teams to search for</i>
<i>that missing federal agent.</i>

205
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,991
Some water?

206
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,631
You can wait outside.

207
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,189
Now what happened after
you took her out of the trunk?

208
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,273
We walked a little ways
up to the top of the mountain.

209
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,954
Right where you found me.

210
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,838
- Then where'd you take her?
- I didn't.

211
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,831
<i>They</i> did.

212
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,117
That was the deal. Her instead of me.

213
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,674
- Did you kill her?
- No.

214
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,080
I swear.

215
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,799
- How'd you get this?
- From the ship.

216
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,718
- What ship?
- You saw it.

217
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,553
- I saw a helicopter.
- They were here!

218
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,756
I'm not lying to ya!

219
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,675
There they are! Ask them.
They know what happened.

220
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,911
- Sit down, Duane.
- No! You've gotta stop 'em!

221
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,312
Hurry! Hurry! They were just out there!
They were right outside! They...

222
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,073
- Duane, settle down!
- No!

223
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:46,553
They'll tell you where she is!
The military's in on it. Just ask 'em!

224
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,199
Did you hurt her? Did you hurt her?!

225
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,669
- No!
- What is this?

226
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,231
<i>(coughing)</i>

227
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,115
I'm sorry.

228
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,709
They had to take her.

229
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,548
I hope they're not hurting her...
too much with the tests.

230
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,671
I'm sorry.

231
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,955
- Hey.
- Yeah?

232
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,236
- What's the matter? What did he say to you?
- He's given me nothing.

233
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,076
Were you out here alone?

234
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,151
Yeah. Why?

235
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,916
Nobody goes in or out of that room.

236
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,991
Hey, Mulder...

237
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,514
<i>(high-pitched whine)</i>

238
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,831
<i>(man)</i> Rescue two...

239
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,591
- What are you doing?
- I heard him...

240
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,671
Come here. Come here.

241
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,354
I heard him gagging. He couldn't breathe.

242
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,638
- He said you choked him.
- No one is to interrogate the suspect.

243
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,756
- Except you?
- Except me.

244
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,479
- Did you ask him about Scully?
- Yeah.

245
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,792
- What did he say?
- He started whistling "Stairway to Heaven".

246
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,431
- Keep an eye on him.
- OK.

247
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,789
- You've got Duane Barry?
- Yes, sir.

248
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,429
Agent Mulder,
you disobeyed my direct order.

249
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,994
<i>(man)</i> Call the paramedics!

250
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,030
- What happened?
- He was gagging.

251
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,588
Duane. Duane.

252
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,551
Duane.

253
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,829
<i>(paramedic)</i> Coming through!

254
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,835
- Respiration?
- Nothing.

255
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,631
Start CPR.

256
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,389
Ready?

257
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,278
One, two, three, four, five.

258
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,311
One, two, three...

259
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,996
Excuse me?

260
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,390
I'm Agent Mulder. I'd like a copy
of this man's autopsy report.

261
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,516
I'm sorry. It's still incomplete.

262
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,716
- Are you the pathologist?
- Yes.

263
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,509
Can I ask what your preliminary findings are?

264
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:10,197
Um... second-degree burns on the face,
contusions about the neck, bruised larynx.

265
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,478
If I had to list cause of death at this point,
I'd have to say asphyxiation.

266
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,154
Were you expecting something else?

267
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,235
- You haven't run a toxicological yet?
- They should be finished shortly.

268
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,676
I'd be interested to see what you find.
When will it be on file?

269
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,797
- Later this morning.
- I'd like a copy as soon as possible.

270
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,998
Well, I'm sorry. You'll have to go
through regular military channels.

271
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,548
What do you mean, "military"?

272
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,155
- You're not FBI?
- Quantico's under military jurisdiction.

273
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,994
There wasn't an FBI pathologist
available this morning.

274
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,759
Skinner's expecting my report on the
Duane Barry incident. What do I tell him?

275
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,229
The truth.

276
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,551
- What do you mean?
- Confirm Mulder's version of events.

277
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,200
You've earned his trust.
You have to preserve it.

278
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,353
- For how much longer?
- Until your assignment is completed.

279
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,433
If Mulder's such a threat,
why not eliminate him?

280
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,159
- That's not policy.
- It's not?

281
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,949
After what you had <i>me</i> do?

282
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,798
Kill Mulder and you risk turning
one man's religion into a crusade.

283
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,474
- What about Scully?
- We've taken care of that.

284
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,835
How?

285
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,718
- We tell you what you need to know.
- I've a right to know.

286
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,588
You have no rights,
only orders to be carried out.

287
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,828
If you have a problem with that,
we'll make other arrangements.

288
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,595
The victim appears to have expired
from prolonged hypoxemia...

289
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,708
...secondary to asphyxiation. Of several
etiologies, the most likely is strangulation...

290
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,110
...due to the presence
of contusions and a bruised larynx.

291
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,079
- Do you want to speak, Agent Mulder?
- I didn't kill him, if that's what you mean.

292
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,438
- But you attacked him?
- I was interrogating him about Agent Scully.

293
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:34,479
- He wasn't cooperating, so I pushed him.
- And you lost control.

294
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,552
Momentarily. But then I left the room.

295
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,155
He was very much alive. I spoke to him.
Agent Krycek spoke to him.

296
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,756
Agent Krycek says he entered the room
because the suspect was gagging.

297
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,513
Is Agent Krycek asserting
that I killed him too?

298
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:54,436
No. He corroborates your story. But the fact
is we've got a dead suspect, Agent Mulder...

299
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,239
...and no other plausible cause of death.

300
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:02,599
OPC wants both of you to take a lie-detector
test. You're to report there immediately.

301
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,635
There is another plausible cause of death.

302
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,508
- Which is?
- Poisoning by injection or ingestion.

303
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,514
Poisoning?

304
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,479
You won't find that
on the Navy pathologist's report.

305
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,791
- What are you saying?
- That the autopsy is incomplete.

306
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,838
That the military covered up
the toxicological findings.

307
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,879
- And why would they do that?
- Because <i>they</i> know where Scully is.

308
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,633
Why are you so paranoid, Mulder?

309
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,714
Oh, I don't know... Maybe it's because
I find it hard to trust anybody.

310
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,311
- Alex? Alex? Can I borrow your car keys?
- Why? Where are going?

311
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,073
- There's somebody I gotta see.
- We're scheduled...

312
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,754
I know. Just give me the keys. Please.

313
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,951
Thanks.

314
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,197
You wasted a trip, Mr Mulder. There's
nothing the senator can do for you now.

315
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,397
- What?
- Not without committing political suicide.

316
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,029
Why? Do they have something on him?

317
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,989
They have something on everyone, Mr
Mulder. The question is when they'll use it.

318
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,953
- I need his help.
- No one can help you now.

319
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,873
Your channels of appeal
and recourse are closed.

320
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,758
Your predecessor could've helped me.

321
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,111
You know, don't you?

322
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,836
- You know what's happened to her.
- This reaches beyond any of us, Mr Mulder.

323
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,310
- Even my predecessor.
- I want an answer!

324
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,630
Why kill Duane Barry
if there was nothing to hide?

325
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,430
- You mean the government?
- There are no answers for you, Mr Mulder.

326
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,909
They only have one policy:

327
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,751
Deny everything.

328
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:31,480
- This is a serious allegation, Agent Mulder.
- Only so far as it is true.

329
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:37,672
"Agent Krycek was hired by an outside
agency to impede a federal investigation...

330
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,151
...and may be responsible for the death
of a suspect in a capital murder case."

331
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,595
It goes on.

332
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,992
"And the possible murder of
the tram operator at Skyland Mountain."

333
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,640
There's a lot of blood on this document. Are
you standing behind this going on record?

334
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,675
Yes, sir.

335
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,435
Then you damn well better
have the facts to back it up.

336
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,472
I need to see Agent Krycek, immediately.

337
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,234
I can't protect you, Agent Mulder.

338
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,114
Past a point, this will become
a larger Bureau matter.

339
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,589
All right, what have you got?

340
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,876
I found this in Agent Krycek's car.
He doesn't smoke.

341
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,670
Agent Krycek was the last person
with Duane Barry before he died.

342
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,594
He was also the last person to see
the tram operator before he disappeared.

343
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,196
When I got to the top of Skyland Mountain,
I saw an unmarked helicopter in the area.

344
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,068
I believe Krycek gave away
the whereabouts of Duane Barry and Scully...

345
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,151
...to whoever he's working with.

346
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,310
- And who is that?
- I don't know.

347
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,915
The military? Some covert organisation
within the government?

348
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,992
Whoever the man who smokes
those cigarettes works for.

349
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,990
Why?

350
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,550
Because Agent Scully got too close
to whatever they're trying to deny.

351
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:13,112
Because she had hard and damning evidence
- that metallic implant - in her possession.

352
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:18,433
Or because her termination would prevent
further involvement with me and my work.

353
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,788
Do you think Agent Scully's dead?

354
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,431
I don't know.

355
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,749
How far do you think they'd go?

356
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,676
What do you know about Krycek?

357
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,196
- I didn't give him the assignment. I only...
- <i>(phone)</i>

358
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,438
Yes.

359
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,511
Thank you.

360
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,194
Agent Krycek didn't show up
for work this morning.

361
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,278
His home number has been disconnected.

362
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,872
That's it? He's gone?
He just disappears into the woodwork?

363
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,154
So it would appear.

364
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,279
Who are these people who can murder with
impunity and we can't do anything about it?

365
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,271
- Let it go.
- Like hell!

366
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,670
- There's nothing you can do.
- What can <i>you</i> do about it?

367
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,790
There's only one thing that I <i>can</i> do,
Agent Mulder.

368
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,797
As of right now, I'm reopening the X-Files.

369
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,758
That's what they fear the most.

370
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,311
Agent Mulder? Thank you for calling me.

371
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,552
- Sorry I don't have better news.
- Do you know something? Is Dana OK?

372
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,594
I don't know anything more about it.

373
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,514
I know you're doing all you can.

374
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,598
I had that dream again last night,
about Dana being taken away.

375
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,469
I can't tell you how it scares me.

376
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,434
It's probably scarier
when you <i>stop</i> having the dream.

377
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,516
Don't you think?

378
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,277
I found this.

379
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,950
It's something I...
I never considered about her.

380
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,389
If she was... if she was such a sceptic...

381
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,349
...why did she wear that?

382
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,839
I gave it to her on her 15th birthday.

383
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,709
Don't you want to keep it?

384
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,274
When you find her, you give it to her.

385
