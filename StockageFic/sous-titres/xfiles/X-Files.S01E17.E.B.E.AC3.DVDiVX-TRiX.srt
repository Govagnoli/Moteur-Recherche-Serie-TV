(Explosion)

7
00:01:23,497 --> 00:01:25,397
Oh, man!

8
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:31,203
This is Southern Crescent
to Red Crescent.

9
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:33,967
We've got a downed plane
at camp perimeter.

10
00:01:34,074 --> 00:01:34,972
That's a negative.

11
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:36,770
We have nothing in the sky.

12
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:38,572
We got something down here.

13
00:01:38,678 --> 00:01:40,111
Advise Medevac to stand by.

14
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,114
We're going to check it out.

15
00:01:44,418 --> 00:01:47,353
Medevac One, Medevac One,
this is Red Crescent.

16
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:51,653
Southern Crescent reports downed
aircraft in their area. Over.

17
00:02:44,277 --> 00:02:46,211
Breaker, breaker,
this is Quick Light.

18
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:48,747
Anybody out there
with their ears on?

19
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:52,148
Readin' you loud and clear.
This is Betty Blue. Come on.

20
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:54,312
From Opryland,
it's the Grand Ole Opry

21
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:56,321

22
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:58,550
brought toyou
by Goody's Headache Powder.

23
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:02,959
When the night's been too long
and the party's been too hearty,

24
00:03:03,063 --> 00:03:05,964
Goody's Headache Powder
will straighten you right out.

25
00:03:06,032 --> 00:03:08,967
And you have myword on that.
Goody--

00:03:09,035 --> 00:03:11,230
(Loud Static)

27
00:03:17,477 --> 00:03:20,412
C.B. Caller #1 : It was cigar-shaped,
red and green lights

28
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,947
fast as hell.

29
00:03:22,015 --> 00:03:25,314
Caller #2: I seen three ofthem
fying over Chester County.

30
00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:28,286
Caller #3: Right, right.
Six troopers were chasing them down 22.

31
00:03:28,355 --> 00:03:29,515
(Siren Blaring)

32
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:33,525
Caller #4: I see one now.
It's over the water tower.

33
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:36,562
Red and green lights
just likeyou said!

34
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:59,318
(Loud Hum)

35
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:50,501
From the trucker's description,
the shape he fired upon

36
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,936
could conceivably have been
a mountain lion's.

37
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:54,496
Conceivably.

38
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:57,372
The National Weather Service
last night reported

39
00:04:57,444 --> 00:05:00,607
atmospheric conditions
in this area which were possibly

40
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,739
conducive to lightning.

41
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:04,750
Possibly.

42
00:05:10,223 --> 00:05:13,317
It is feasible that the truck
was struck by lightning

43
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:15,724
creating the electrical failure.

44
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:18,627
It's feasible.

45
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:20,996
And you know there's
a marsh over there.

46
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:27,131
Those lights the driver saw
may have been swamp gas.

47
00:05:27,207 --> 00:05:29,471
Swamp gas?

48
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:32,170
It's a natural phenomenon
in which phospine and methane

49
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:34,805
rising from decaying
organic matter

50
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:37,349
ignite, creating globes
ofblue fame.

51
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:40,318
Happens to me
when I eat Dodger Dogs.

52
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:42,321
How can a dozen witnesses

53
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:45,324
including a squad ofpolice vehicles
in three counties

54
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:47,326
become hysterical
over swamp gas?

55
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:49,793
I've investigated
multiple sightings before.

56
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:52,024
Chesapeake Bay,
the Okoboji Lakes,

57
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:53,360
Area 51 in Nevada.

58
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:55,401
None had this much
supporting evidence.

59
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:57,970
Anecdotal data,
exhaust residue

60
00:05:58,071 --> 00:05:59,629
radiation levels
five times the norm.

61
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:02,368
Mulder, none ofthat
evidence is conclusive.

62
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:06,071
The question is,
whywas the trucker singled out?

63
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:09,115
Isn't it more plausible
that an exhausted truck driver

64
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:13,312
became swept up in the hysteria
and fired upon hallucinations?

65
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:16,321
After all, the road
can play tricks on you.

66
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:18,949
Yeah, it can play tricks on you

67
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,892
but not like this.

68
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:27,365
I started these stop watches
at the same time.

69
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:31,434
I don't know
why they're holding me.

70
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:34,029
This "firing a weapon
on a county road" charge

71
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:36,735
is a lot ofhorse manure.

72
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,643
I'm a vet and I know how
to handle a gun.

73
00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:42,876
Mr. Ranheim, I'd appreciate it
ifyou could elaborate

74
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:46,407
on the reportyou filed last night
regarding your encounter.

75
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:47,953
It was round...

76
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,982
Iike a saucer.

77
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:55,887
And green and orange lights.

78
00:06:55,995 --> 00:06:58,896
Last nightyou said
it was cigar-shaped and black.

79
00:06:58,965 --> 00:07:01,832
I didn't ask for this to happen.

80
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:05,401
(Coughs)

81
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:08,908
All I want is to deliver my shipment
ofauto parts and forget...

82
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:10,772
(Coughing)

83
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:19,876
Pardon me for asking,

84
00:07:19,953 --> 00:07:22,683
but how long haveyou
had that cough?

85
00:07:26,693 --> 00:07:27,887
Why?

86
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:30,554
I'm just concerned.
You said you were a veteran.

87
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:32,631
What's that got to do with this?

88
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:35,895
The cough, the fever, the rash.

89
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:38,199
Those are all symptoms
ofGulfWar Syndrome.

90
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:39,761
I was never in the GulfWar.

91
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,037
Okay. So, how long haveyou
not been yourself?

92
00:07:49,182 --> 00:07:51,116
Since the thing last night.

93
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:57,219
Mr. Ranheim,
I'm Police Chief Rivers.

94
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,588
Please, forgive
the misunderstanding.

95
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:02,025
Your truck's been squared away.
You may go.

96
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:03,356
I'd like to examine the truck.

97
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:04,862
That won't be necessary.

98
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:06,865
This man had
an alleged close encounter.

99
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:09,367
The truck contains
important evidence.

100
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:10,834
Sir! lfl may...

101
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:12,804
You've gotten all
you're going to get.

102
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:15,306
We will no longer cooperate
in your investigation.

103
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,399
Why?

104
00:08:16,476 --> 00:08:20,105
just... go away.

105
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:28,778
Not... Not here.

106
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:45,035
It's obvious someone
got to the police chief.

107
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:46,366
Ranheim was hiding something.

108
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:48,100
Ranheim was sick.

109
00:08:48,174 --> 00:08:49,766
Only since last night.

110
00:08:49,843 --> 00:08:51,310
Excuse me,
could I useyour pen?

111
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:52,969
Mm-hmm.

112
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:56,277
You suggesting GulfWar Syndrome
is caused by UFOs?

113
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:59,580
UFOs are frequentlywitnessed
by soldiers during wartime.

114
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:01,815
Thanks.

115
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:03,253
Hereyou go.

116
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:06,258
The only UFOs
that soldiers are likely to see

117
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:07,987
are secret military aircraft.

118
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:10,426
What ifthat's what
made the soldiers in lraq sick--

119
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:13,932
the exhaust or fuel
ofa classified aircraft or its weapon?

120
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:19,671
There is a base
in Little Rock.

121
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:22,173
You think that's what the air force
was fying that night?

122
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:26,611
They'd deny it, but it could explain
how Ranheim developed his symptoms.

123
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,112
Possibly.

124
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:31,742
I want to talk to some people
when we get back to Washington.

125
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:34,252
The military isn't going to talk.

126
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,312
No, these guys are like
an extreme government watchdog group.

127
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,756
They publish a magazine
called the Lone Gunman.

128
00:09:39,826 --> 00:09:42,294
Some oftheir information
is first-rate--

129
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:44,296
covert actions,
classified weapons.

130
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:47,527
Some oftheir ideas
are downright spooky.

131
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:48,498
(Clicking)

132
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:50,763
So, Mulder, I had breakfast

133
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:52,771
with the guywho shot
john F. Kennedy.

134
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:54,272
Is that so?

135
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,606
Yeah. Says he was dressed as a cop
on the grassy knoll.

136
00:09:58,678 --> 00:10:02,910
Mulder, listen to this. Zhirinovsky, the
leader ofthe Russian social democrats--

137
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:04,916
he's being put into power

138
00:10:04,984 --> 00:10:07,009
by the most heinous and evil force
ofthe 20th century.

139
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:09,179
Barney?

140
00:10:10,156 --> 00:10:11,589
The C.I.A.

141
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:12,682
Hmm.

142
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:15,250
Is this your skeptical partner?

143
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:16,453
(Camera Clicks)

144
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:18,553
She's hot.

145
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:23,068
You don't believe the C.I.A., threatened
by a loss ofpower and funding,

146
00:10:23,136 --> 00:10:25,730
wouldn't dream ofhaving
the old enemy back?

147
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:27,966
I thinkyou give the government
too much credit.

148
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:33,111
The government can't control
the deficit or manage crime.

149
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:35,113
Lone Gunman.

150
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:38,207
What makes you think they can plan
and execute an elaborate conspiracy?

151
00:10:38,284 --> 00:10:39,410
She is hot.

152
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:41,043
Settle down, Frohike.

153
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,886
It's not idiots on the hill
trying to bone Capitol pages.

154
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,358
We're talking about a dark network--

155
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,928
a government within a government
controlling our every move.

156
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:51,428
How can they do that?

157
00:10:51,497 --> 00:10:53,761
How? I'll showyou how.
You got a $20 bill?

158
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,301
Hmm.

159
00:10:56,402 --> 00:10:58,063
I'll check.

160
00:10:58,137 --> 00:11:00,731
Mm-hmm.

161
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,237
Hey!

162
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,120
That'sjust one method.

163
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:18,657
They use this magnetic strip
to trackyou.

164
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:21,592
Wheneveryou go through
a metal detector at an airport

165
00:11:21,694 --> 00:11:23,628
they know exactly
how much you're carrying.

166
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:25,425
It is a federal crime
to deface money.

167
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:28,160
The strip is
an anti-counterfeiting measure.

168
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:30,930
On the inside?
Other countries put it on the outside.

169
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:32,938
O... O... Okay, all right.

170
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:35,270
What doyou know
about GulfWar Syndrome?

171
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:37,002
Agent Orange ofthe '90s.

172
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:39,101
Shells coated with depleted uranium.

173
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:43,478
Heard ofany classified planes
being fown during the Persian GulfWar?

174
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:48,384
Why expose secret planes to an air force
that runs to lran wheneveryou fy?

175
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:50,615
Any UFO activity
during that period?

176
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,717
Yeah. UFOs caused GulfWar Syndrome.
That's a good one.

177
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:57,762
That's whywe likeyou, Mulder.
Your ideas are weirder than ours.

178
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:03,699
Scully: Those were the most
paranoid people I have ever met.

179
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:07,171
How could you think their ideas
are remotely plausible?

180
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,006
I think it's remotely plausible
that someone might thinkyou're hot.

181
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:18,684
Did you see the way
they answered the telephone?

182
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:22,187
They probably think
every call they get is monitored

183
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:25,088
and they're followed
everywhere they go.

184
00:12:25,158 --> 00:12:26,955
It's a form ofself-delusion.

185
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,994
It makes them think
that what they're doing

186
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:30,962
is important enough
that somebodywould...

187
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,194
What's the matter?

188
00:13:36,395 --> 00:13:39,296
(Phone Ringing)

189
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:43,499

192
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:09,194
Yeah.
What are we doing here?

193
00:14:09,262 --> 00:14:12,993
Missed your calling,
did you, Mr. Mulder?

194
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:17,001
Maybe this yearwe can catch a game
at Camden Yards.

195
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:21,932
Ofcourse, we wouldn't
be able to sit together.

196
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:23,908
That's too bad.

197
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:28,003
Something tells meyou'd have
the connections to get great seats.

198
00:14:28,114 --> 00:14:30,912

In our line,
nothing isjust what it seems.

202
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:43,561
What am I onto?

203
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:46,530
We go to investigate
a truck driver's encounterwith a UFO

204
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:49,534
and the next thing we're discovering
electronic surveillance equipment.

205
00:14:49,602 --> 00:14:51,832
Who's listening to us?

206
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:55,540
Whywon'tyou tell me?

207
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:08,178
What am I onto?

208
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:12,316
A dangerous path.

(First Man Speaking Excitedly)

(Yelling Response)

214
00:15:41,621 --> 00:15:43,213
The truck is bogus

215
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:45,780
and so's the truck driver,
Ranheim.

216
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:47,416
First I checked his manifest.

217
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:50,326
It listed a truck carrying
1 08 cartons ofauto parts

218
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:51,886
weighing 3,1 00 pounds.

219
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:54,398
Then I checked with three
weigh stations along his route.

220
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:57,402
They have it listed
at 5,1 00 pounds.

221
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,564
There's something in that truck,
and it's not auto parts.

222
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,370
And ofcourse,
nobody ever reported him.

223
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:06,104
Furthermore, Ranheim lied
about being in the GulfWar.

224
00:16:06,212 --> 00:16:09,147
His real name is Frank Druce.

225
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,149
And I worked hard
to get this one--

226
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:13,151
He was special operations,
black beret,

227
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:15,153
in Mosul, Northern lraq.

228
00:16:15,221 --> 00:16:19,157
Also, he didn't get sick
from the encounter the other night.

229
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:21,591
He's been to the V.A. hospital
for treatments

230
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:22,821
three times in the pastyear.

231
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:24,453
We had it.

232
00:16:25,531 --> 00:16:27,999
We had it,
and we let it go.

233
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:32,566
Four days ago
an lraqi Air Force pilot

234
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:34,765
shot down
an unidentified fying object.

235
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,435
The wreckage and possibly the occupants
were recovered by the army.

236
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:41,604
Ranheim, the truck driver,
would be a perfect escort

237
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:43,807
for the wreckage and/or bodies

238
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,851
out oflraq to a laboratory
in the United States.

239
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:51,015
That would explain why the truck
weighs so much more than listed.

240
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,024
The military has, in the past,

241
00:16:53,092 --> 00:16:55,026
transported dangerous
materials and weapons...

242
00:16:55,094 --> 00:16:57,494
in unmarked trucks
across the country.

243
00:16:57,563 --> 00:17:00,691
I'm beginning to sound like those guys
at the Lone Gunman, right?

244
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:02,666
Where did you obtain
this information?

245
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:06,102
Let'sjust say it's a source
with a deep background.

246
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:10,733
I want to know all about him.

247
00:17:10,843 --> 00:17:13,368
All I know is that
he's guided us away from harm.

248
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:15,413
How doyou know that?

249
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:18,177
We work for the Federal Bureau of
lnvestigation, and we're being bugged.

250
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,184
What does that tell you?

251
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:22,516
That tells me that not everything
is as it appears to be.

252
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:24,021
Exactly.

253
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:27,582
For all we know, this deep background
is responsible for the bug.

254
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,184
He's never lied to me.

255
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:31,161
I won't break that confidence.

256
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,492
I trust him.

257
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:35,033
Mulder, you're the only one I trust.

258
00:17:36,102 --> 00:17:38,570
Then you're going
to have to trust me.

259
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:43,274
Did you find out
where the truck is now?

260
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:44,604
Generally.

261
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,076
It's heading west,
towards Colorado.

262
00:17:47,146 --> 00:17:50,081
We've got to try to intercept it
and see what's on board.

263
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:52,083
I'm going to go
pick up a few things.

264
00:17:52,151 --> 00:17:55,086
I'll meetyou back atyour place
in an hour, okay?

265
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:14,596
I cut the main breaker.

266
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:18,400
(Sighs)

267
00:18:22,715 --> 00:18:24,774
You risk exposure coming here.

268
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,648
What I have here
is too important.

269
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:30,855
The photograph in that envelope

270
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:33,858
was taken by an officer
at Fort Benning, Georgia.

271
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:36,861
1 7 UFOs were spotted in one hour.

272
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:39,830
Is that where the lraqi
wreckage is being held?

273
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:41,833
Are UFOs monitoring the area?

274
00:18:42,902 --> 00:18:44,995
Nice placeyou have here.

275
00:18:48,741 --> 00:18:50,709
Wait. Wait.

276
00:18:50,776 --> 00:18:54,337
I just wanted to take
this opportunity to thankyou.

277
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:56,347
You've helped mywork so much

278
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:59,350
and you've never asked
for anything in return

279
00:18:59,418 --> 00:19:02,615
and I knowyou've putyourself
at great risk to do so.

280
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,385
This is the best photographic evidence
I have ever seen.

281
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:36,387
I knew the Gulf Breeze photos
were a hoax,

282
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:40,323
but this is the quality ofevidence
the government has amassed for decades

283
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:42,223
at the highest classified levels.

284
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:45,195
That business
with the truckwas a decoy

285
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:47,698
to keep anyone looking closely
away from Fort Benning

286
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:49,757
where they are keeping
the remains ofthe lraqi UFO.

287
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:51,860
We've got to leave
for Georgia immediately.

288
00:19:51,971 --> 00:19:53,905
This photograph is a fake.

289
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:54,962
What?

290
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:56,507
Look.

291
00:19:58,811 --> 00:20:02,907
This soldier's shadow is allegedly
created by the lights from the UFO,

292
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:06,213
but it falls in a direction
contradictory to the craft's position.

293
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:09,948
There could be an off-camera
light source creating that shadow.

294
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:13,583
Look closely at the color ofthe light
refected in the windshield.

295
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:16,594
It should be from
the red lights ofthe UFO

296
00:20:16,662 --> 00:20:19,722
but it doesn't match the color
ofthe ship's lights.

297
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:21,732
There's probably tint
in the windshield.

298
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,360
Or the gradation could be attributed
to atmospheric conditions.

299
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,698
We should have it analyzed.

300
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:28,432
You're determined
not to believe him.

301
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,771
Maybeyou're too determined
to believe him.

302
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:32,606
I am determined
to follow a lead

303
00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:34,908
that may result
in the proofofthe existence

304
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,210
ofextraterrestrial
biological entities.

305
00:20:37,283 --> 00:20:40,650
Mulder, listen.
Please, will youjust hear me?

306
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:44,021
I have never met anyone

307
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:47,752
so passionate and dedicated
to a beliefas you.

308
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:50,795
It's so intense
that sometimes it's blinding.

309
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:54,924
But there are others who are
watching you who know what I know.

310
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,868
And whereas I can respect
and admireyour passion,

311
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:00,871
theywill use it againstyou.

312
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:07,742
Mulder, the truth is out there,
but so are lies.

313
00:21:09,014 --> 00:21:10,447
Thankyou.

314
00:22:04,436 --> 00:22:07,166
I had the photo analyzed
by the Bureau's computers.

315
00:22:07,272 --> 00:22:09,672
Initially,
it appears to be legitimate.

316
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:11,835
The film grain matches
in pattern and density,

317
00:22:11,944 --> 00:22:13,377
color levels, shading.

318
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:15,072
Then I noticed this.

319
00:22:15,147 --> 00:22:18,173
It's the moon, halffull.

320
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,346
I had the refection
in this window enlarged by 25.

321
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:25,356
There's the moon again,
a quarter full--

322
00:22:25,424 --> 00:22:27,915
not to mention that the window couldn't
even catch the moon's refection

323
00:22:27,993 --> 00:22:29,426
from that angle.

324
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:31,395
You were right, Scully.

325
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:32,691
It's a fake.

326
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:35,700
He tried to deceive us.

327
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:38,259
Now we're alone on this.

328
00:22:38,337 --> 00:22:40,737
There's no one we can trust.

329
00:22:40,806 --> 00:22:44,207
Theywent to a lot oftrouble
to put us on the wrong track.

330
00:22:44,276 --> 00:22:47,211
There's something here
that no one's supposed to find.

331
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:05,462
Why didn'tyou leave
for Fort Benning?

332
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:08,500
The photograph was a fake.

333
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:12,867
Well, at leastyou're not insulting me
further by feigning appalled surprise.

334
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:15,532
I think a compliment is in order.

335
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:18,542
That photo was prepared
by ourvery best.

336
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,043
I thoughtyou were my ally.

337
00:23:20,112 --> 00:23:22,046
Oh, I am.

338
00:23:22,114 --> 00:23:25,242
Imagine if Eisenhower told the Allies
D-Daywould take place in Belgium.

339
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:29,151
I place my life in greatjeopardy
every time we speak.

340
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:35,826
I've been a participant in
some ofthe most insidious lies...

341
00:23:35,894 --> 00:23:39,557
and witness to deeds that
no crazed man could imagine.

342
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:41,861
I spentyears watching you...

343
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:44,959
from my, uh, lofty position

344
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,335
to know thatyou were
the one I could trust.

345
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:51,433
- Then why did you lie to me?
- To divertyou.

346
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,944
You and Scully
are excellent investigators

347
00:23:54,012 --> 00:23:56,947
and your motives arejust.

348
00:23:57,015 --> 00:23:59,449
However, there still
exist some secrets

349
00:23:59,518 --> 00:24:01,383
which should remain secret--

350
00:24:01,453 --> 00:24:04,616
truths that people
arejust not ready to know.

351
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,353
Who areyou
to decide that for me?

352
00:24:08,427 --> 00:24:12,193
The world's reaction to such knowledge
would be far too dangerous.

353
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:16,701
Dangerous. You mean,
in the sense ofoutrage,

354
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:19,704
Iike the reaction to
the Kennedy assassination or M.I.A.s

355
00:24:19,772 --> 00:24:23,469
or radiation experiments
on terminal patients, Watergate,

356
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:26,477
Iran-Contra, Roswell,
the Tuskegee experiments.

357
00:24:26,545 --> 00:24:27,944
Where will it end?

358
00:24:30,783 --> 00:24:33,479
Oh, I guess it won't end
as long as...

359
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:37,147
men likeyou decide
what is truth.

360
00:24:37,222 --> 00:24:41,386
That transcriptyou gave me
ofthe lraqi pilot-- that was the truth.

361
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,722
Yeah.

362
00:24:42,795 --> 00:24:45,696
Why did you even bother
to show it to me?

363
00:24:45,764 --> 00:24:48,733
Well, I was aware
thatyou were onto the truck

364
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:52,328
so I knew that down the road
I would have to steeryou away,

365
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:54,564
that I would have to lie toyou,

366
00:24:54,673 --> 00:24:56,607
and a lie, Mr. Mulder,

367
00:24:56,675 --> 00:25:00,736
is most convincingly hidden
between two truths.

368
00:25:02,948 --> 00:25:04,882
Mulder.

369
00:25:06,018 --> 00:25:08,953
Ifa shark stops swimming,
it will die.

370
00:25:12,024 --> 00:25:14,458
Don't stop swimming.

371
00:25:16,195 --> 00:25:19,096
I'm not responsible
for the electronic surveillance

372
00:25:19,164 --> 00:25:22,622
but I do know
they can still hearyou.

373
00:26:48,754 --> 00:26:50,688
(Doorbell Rings)

374
00:26:50,756 --> 00:26:52,690
Scully:
Mulder!

375
00:26:54,192 --> 00:26:56,126
Areyou home?

376
00:26:59,364 --> 00:27:01,457
Scully, glad you dropped by.

377
00:27:01,566 --> 00:27:04,262
I been thinking
about this whole situation.

378
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:06,337
And I thinkyou're right.

379
00:27:06,438 --> 00:27:09,271
I thinkwe shouldjust move on.

380
00:27:31,563 --> 00:27:35,055
I think this time
you're right, Mulder.

381
00:27:57,422 --> 00:27:59,356
All right, stickwith him.

382
00:28:32,057 --> 00:28:33,490
Hey!

383
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,834
There is your round-trip
ticket to Chicago.

384
00:28:43,902 --> 00:28:45,665
Here's your credit card.

385
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:48,262
And the plane departs at gate 35.

386
00:28:48,373 --> 00:28:51,274
I'd also like a one-way
ticket to Los Angeles

387
00:28:51,343 --> 00:28:54,244
with a stop in Las Vegas,
and I'll be paying cash.

388
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,845
(Horns Honking)

389
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,560
Called everyweigh station
and bureau office west ofColorado.

390
00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:19,620
Tied up an airphone
for three hours.

391
00:30:19,698 --> 00:30:23,065
SomeJapanese businessman
told me to stick a piece ofsushi

392
00:30:23,168 --> 00:30:25,003
where the sun don't shine.

393
00:30:26,404 --> 00:30:29,032
My ear's numb from being
on hold for so many hours.

394
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:32,042
At least they didn't trace our call.

395
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:35,079
I couldn't find the truck.
Did you have any luck?

396
00:30:35,147 --> 00:30:38,275
Yep. It's heading
northwest on l-90.

397
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:41,285
We have to get a couple
oftickets to Seattle.

398
00:30:47,592 --> 00:30:49,082
Yeah, think about it.

399
00:30:49,194 --> 00:30:51,424
This truck drove across America.

400
00:30:51,496 --> 00:30:55,262
People it passed probably thought
it was hauling auto parts or furniture,

401
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:57,267
Iivestock, whatever.

402
00:30:57,335 --> 00:31:01,203
Nobodywould have suspected it was
hauling a craft from anotherworld.

403
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,499
Here we go.

404
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:44,372
Mulder, we've been following
this truck for hours.

405
00:31:44,449 --> 00:31:47,907
Maybe he knows we're following him
and he's taking an evasive route.

406
00:31:47,986 --> 00:31:50,216
Well, ifthat were the case...

407
00:31:50,322 --> 00:31:52,483
(Loud Static)

408
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:13,535
You all right?

409
00:32:13,612 --> 00:32:14,738
Yeah.

410
00:32:14,813 --> 00:32:16,246
Come on.

411
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:28,254
Scully:
Ranheim!

412
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:32,794
Ranheim?

413
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:11,193
Scully!

414
00:33:15,874 --> 00:33:17,307
Scully:
Oh, my God.

415
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:21,072
It was an extraterrestrial
biological entity... alive.

416
00:33:22,147 --> 00:33:23,478
Where did it go?

417
00:33:25,283 --> 00:33:28,650
I thinkwe werejust witness
to a rescue mission.

418
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:51,275
God, Mulder, I can't stop shaking.

419
00:33:51,343 --> 00:33:54,938
Whatjust happened--
does it fit the profile?

420
00:33:55,013 --> 00:33:58,039
Areyou asking me ifit was real?

421
00:33:58,116 --> 00:34:00,243
Did wejust have
a close encounter?

422
00:34:04,823 --> 00:34:06,757
No. It was another hoax.

423
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:14,891
But how could anyone
generate such force?

424
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:17,901
Whatever they used,
we probably haven't heard ofit.

425
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:21,905
Sound weapons, a stealth helicopter
with an ultra high-intensity light.

426
00:34:21,973 --> 00:34:25,067
It doesn't matter.
There's no evidence that this was a UFO.

427
00:34:25,143 --> 00:34:28,806
So they created this elaborate show
just to defect us again?

428
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,440
Wouldn't it have been
easier for them just...

429
00:34:31,516 --> 00:34:33,381
just to kill us.

430
00:34:33,451 --> 00:34:35,817
Yeah, I've wondered that myself.

431
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,913
Maybe they're using me against myself,
likeyou said before.

432
00:34:40,024 --> 00:34:41,958
That I want so badly to believe,

433
00:34:42,026 --> 00:34:44,927
that I'djust accept
the obvious conclusions and walk away.

434
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,735
Well, now we have
nothing to go on

435
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:55,072
and no one to turn to.

436
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,337
There's still one player in all this
who hasn't lied to us,

437
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:01,277
but it's not quite someone
we can turn to.

438
00:35:01,346 --> 00:35:04,543
Leverling and Priest Rapids,

439
00:35:04,616 --> 00:35:07,551
east bank ofthe Columbia River.

440
00:35:07,652 --> 00:35:10,917
Did you send out
a field investigator?

441
00:35:11,022 --> 00:35:14,082
And you can
substantiate the sighting?

442
00:35:14,192 --> 00:35:16,626
Okay, Nick. Thanks a lot.

443
00:35:16,694 --> 00:35:20,858
I've contacted several organizations
that have hot lines for UFO reports.

444
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,434
Center for UFO Studies in Chicago,

445
00:35:24,502 --> 00:35:26,129
MUFON, NICAP...

446
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:29,332
None ofthem have ever reported
a week ofsuch activity.

447
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:32,501
It began in Tennessee
where Ranheim was encountered.

448
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:35,808
The sightings are following
the path ofthe truck.

449
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,678
And after last night's hoax...

450
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,843
Look at this.

451
00:35:40,952 --> 00:35:44,786
Seven sightings in Mattawa, Washington,
a hundred miles away.

452
00:35:44,856 --> 00:35:46,221
Aliens?

453
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:49,920
Looks like theywant
their colleague back.

454
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:56,292
We've driven full circle
through Mattawa twice.

455
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:58,335
There's nothing here.

456
00:35:58,403 --> 00:36:01,270
(Rock Music)

457
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:03,534
What's over there?

458
00:36:13,785 --> 00:36:16,345
Man:
We have been waiting!

459
00:36:16,454 --> 00:36:19,514
Welcome to our home!

460
00:36:19,624 --> 00:36:22,559
We are willing to go with you!

Freddie:
Ahh-doo-nay-vah-so-barahgahs.

462
00:36:24,863 --> 00:36:27,423
That's an intergalactic
space greeting.

463
00:36:27,499 --> 00:36:29,433
That means
" Hello, space brothers."

464
00:36:29,501 --> 00:36:30,661
- Hello.
- What's going on here?

465
00:36:30,735 --> 00:36:32,032
A UFO party.

466
00:36:32,103 --> 00:36:33,502
You've seen UFOs?

467
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:36,267
Last two nights.
They're drawn to our electric power.

468
00:36:36,341 --> 00:36:39,777
They hover over
the power plant down there.

469
00:36:39,844 --> 00:36:43,302
Man:
Everyone! They are here!

470
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:51,855
Yes, sir, that's right.

471
00:36:51,923 --> 00:36:54,483
It's all secure.
Lock it up.

472
00:36:54,592 --> 00:36:55,854
Mulder:
This is it.

473
00:36:55,927 --> 00:36:58,191
There's Ranheim.

474
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:06,997
This place has got to have
the highest level ofsecurity.

475
00:37:07,071 --> 00:37:10,165
just the kind ofchallenge
they're looking for.

476
00:37:10,241 --> 00:37:11,503

480
00:37:21,653 --> 00:37:24,087
It's Mulder.
Turn the tape recorder off.

481
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,114
Okay. It's off.

482
00:37:27,225 --> 00:37:29,557
- Turn it off!.
- It's offalready.

483
00:37:29,627 --> 00:37:32,528
How would you like
to have on your front page

484
00:37:32,597 --> 00:37:35,862
the first substantiated photo of
an extraterrestrial biological entity?

485
00:37:35,934 --> 00:37:39,768
No way. An E.B.E.?
What do we have to do?

486
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:41,940
just hack me
some identification numbers.

Braidwood and Stefoff.

488
00:37:52,817 --> 00:37:54,341
Personal identification number?

489
00:37:54,419 --> 00:37:56,114
7-5-9-3.

490
00:37:56,187 --> 00:37:57,586
5-3-1 -1 .

491
00:37:58,823 --> 00:38:00,222
Open the trunk, please.

493
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:18,898
Thanks.

494
00:38:26,918 --> 00:38:28,180
Hey, wait!

495
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:33,223
Display these at all times.

496
00:38:34,592 --> 00:38:36,025
Proceed.

497
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:56,146
Langly said he couldn't gain access
to level six, so that's whywe...

498
00:39:12,196 --> 00:39:14,460
We have to go back
through that door.

499
00:39:14,532 --> 00:39:16,329
We'll look suspicious going back.

500
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:18,631
We'll have to find
another access then.

501
00:39:18,703 --> 00:39:20,136
Theywon't let us.

502
00:39:22,607 --> 00:39:24,199
You folks come with me, please.

503
00:39:24,275 --> 00:39:25,867

-Just proceed down the hallway.
- Ifyou couldjust help us...

505

the Federal Bureau oflnvestigation.

please.

This is level two to level six.

511
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:51,533
I have a male and a female
who have identified themselves...

512
00:39:51,602 --> 00:39:52,899
- Mulder!
- Stop!

513
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,096

00:40:05,883 --> 00:40:06,975
This way.

526
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,060
Let him go!

527
00:40:51,129 --> 00:40:53,290
You've done well.

528
00:40:53,364 --> 00:40:55,059
You're dismissed.

529
00:41:05,676 --> 00:41:07,701
I know how badly,

530
00:41:07,779 --> 00:41:12,546
how... very badlyyou want
to look through that window.

531
00:41:12,617 --> 00:41:14,050
But it would be pointless.

532
00:41:14,852 --> 00:41:17,480
It's dead.

533
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:24,485
After the Roswell incident
in 1 947,

534
00:41:24,562 --> 00:41:27,292
even at the brink ofthe Cold War

535
00:41:27,365 --> 00:41:29,299
there was an ultrasecret conference

536
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:31,028
attended by the United States,
the Soviet Union,

537
00:41:31,102 --> 00:41:33,730
the People's Republic ofChina,
Britain,

538
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:36,069
both Germanies, France,

539
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:41,407
and it was agreed that should
any extraterrestrial biological entity

540
00:41:41,512 --> 00:41:43,002
survive a crash,

541
00:41:43,114 --> 00:41:46,049
the country that held
that being would be responsible

542
00:41:46,117 --> 00:41:49,109
for its extermination.

543
00:41:52,824 --> 00:41:57,261
I, um... have the distinction
ofbeing one ofthree men

544
00:41:57,328 --> 00:42:00,161
to have exterminated such a creature.

545
00:42:01,866 --> 00:42:05,666
I was with the C.I.A. in Vietnam.

546
00:42:05,736 --> 00:42:09,001
A UFO was sighted
for five nights over Hanoi.

547
00:42:09,073 --> 00:42:14,136
The Marines shot it down
and brought it to us.

548
00:42:15,847 --> 00:42:20,443
Maybe... it didn't know
what a gun was

549
00:42:20,518 --> 00:42:23,453
or perhaps
they don't show emotion...

550
00:42:25,523 --> 00:42:31,428
but that... innocent
and blank expression

551
00:42:31,495 --> 00:42:35,431
as I pulled the trigger
has haunted me...

552
00:42:37,602 --> 00:42:39,035
until I found you.

553
00:42:40,104 --> 00:42:42,470
That's why I come toyou,
Mr. Mulder,

554
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:46,601
and will continue
to come toyou to...

555
00:42:46,711 --> 00:42:49,111
atone forwhat I've done.

556
00:42:50,181 --> 00:42:51,614
And maybe sometime

557
00:42:51,682 --> 00:42:53,206
through you,

558
00:42:53,317 --> 00:42:55,285
the truth will be known.

559
00:43:34,091 --> 00:43:37,390
You're awfully quiet,
Mr. Mulder.

560
00:43:40,464 --> 00:43:43,399
I'm wondering
which lie to believe.

561
00:43:44,735 --> 00:43:46,669
