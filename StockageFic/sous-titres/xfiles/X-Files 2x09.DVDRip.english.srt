1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,518
- They were to check in at midnight.
- You try every band?

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,639
- All audiovisual seemed to be down.
- Maybe it's just a satellite glitch.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,589
We thought so too, until we received this...
from a tracking station in Bend, Oregon.

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,240
They picked it up
on an emergency frequency.

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,080
What are those guys doing?

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,511
We did manage to uplink
Firewalker's video camera.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,593
It's at base camp, so we hope it can
give us a picture, tell us what's going on.

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,269
Data feed's coming in now.

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,557
- What's the robot doing in the volcano?
- I don't know.

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,631
There's no descent scheduled.

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,315
Firewalker's not responding.
I can't get control.

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,313
- Someone's overriding it.
- Lock camera remote and pan left.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,792
Stop. Stop!

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,991
Go back.

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,149
Tilt up and zoom in.

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,191
Erikson.

17
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,870
What the hell? Give me that!

18
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,873
There it is again. Did you see that?
You saw that shadow, didn't you?

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,350
Yeah, but what could be moving around
in that kind of heat?

20
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,998
I don't know.

21
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,508
Maybe it was, uh, just a ghost signal.
I mean, it wouldn't be the first time that...

22
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,279
<i>(high-pitched distortion)</i>

23
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,951
What's going on up there?

24
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,718
<i>(TV) Let's go to our science editor Eric</i>
<i>Parker in Mount Avalon, Washington. Eric?</i>

25
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,553

<i>with a group of scientists...</i>

26
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,077
<i>... who are excited about this device,</i>
<i>which looks like a large titanium bug.</i>

27
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,517
<i>Firewalker will next week make</i>
<i>its first descent into an active volcano.</i>

28
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,910
<i>This robot is the brainchild</i>
<i>of volcanologist Daniel Trepkos.</i>

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,195
<i>It will gather samples</i>
<i>from the crater...</i>

30
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,477
<i>... which may hold scientific data</i>
<i>about the Earth's core.</i>

31
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,915
<i>Scientific data?</i>

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,310
<i>We're talking about revisiting</i>
<i>the very origin of the Earth.</i>

33
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,914
<i>Peering into the fire where it all began.</i>

34
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,510
<i>A human endeavour more important even</i>
<i>than man's exploration of space.</i>

35
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,071
That's no mean claim.

36
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,879
Daniel always had a flair
for self-dramatisation.

37
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,511
- I'd always heard that he was brilliant.
- Brilliant doesn't go quite far enough.

38
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,114
He occupies a rare place
among scientists...

39
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,193
...where dreams, ambition and...
great luck converge.

40
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,952
You think his luckjust ran out.

41
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,717
The team sent a distress signal yesterday
after failing to make a status report.

42
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,394
They haven't responded to any of our calls.

43
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,917
But by using remote telemetry,
we were able to activate Firewalker's camera.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,036
This is what we found.

45
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,953
You're looking at the floor of the volcano.

46
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,070
But this is the last thing
we expected to discover.

47
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,233
The dead man is, uh, Phil Erikson...
chief seismologist.

48
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,990
Now, look at this.

49
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,510
Whoa! What the hell is that?

50
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,790
<i>(sighs)</i> We don't know.

51
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,150
Whatever it was disabled the camera.

52
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,438
The temperature readings
are upwards of 130° at this depth.

53
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,829
- But that was alive.
- Why weren't you there?

54
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,391
<i>(sighs)</i> I left the project six weeks ago.
Trepkos and I nearly came to blows.

55
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,636
- Over what?
- Well, I wish I could explain.

56
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,995
Daniel and I, uh...

57
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,878
I always played Salieri to his Mozart.
I was never quite on his plane of intellect.

58
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,076
But this time I found him slipping.

59
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,431
Into madness.

60
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,829
- He controlled the others...
- You think he's responsible for this?

61
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,957
Whatever there is between me and him,
I pray that he isn't.

62
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,795
We've got 20 million tax dollars
in this project. If word of it were to get out...

63
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,793
...it could destroy years of work.
I'm afraid to go through proper channels.

64
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,872
Yeah. We're not exactly proper channels.

65
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,273
- How soon can we get up there?
- There's a flight waiting to take us to Seattle.

66
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,716
From there, a helicopter
will fly us to Mount Avalon.

67
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,071
Scully?

68
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,756
- I don't think it's a good idea for you to go.
- Mulder, I appreciate your concern...

69
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,991
...but I'm ready - I wanna work.

70
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,359
Well, maybe you should take some time off.

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,468
I've already lost too much time.

72
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,831
There it is!

73
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,599
This <i>was</i> Firewalker's satellite relay.

74
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,439
We installed field instruments here.
Seismographs, tiltmeters...

75
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,875
We'll look here after we've checked inside.

76
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,114
The instruments are worth millions of project
dollars. I'm accountable to the USGS for 'em.

77
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,716
- Shouldn't we find the descent team first?
- I just wanna take a quick damage survey.

78
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,189
I'll catch up with you in a few minutes.

79
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,311
Hello?

80
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,071
<i>(flicks light switch)</i>

81
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,790
Looks like somebody wanted to put this
operation permanently out of commission.

82
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,351
<i>(grunts)</i>

83
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,877
Mulder!

84
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,918
- Wait! Wait!
- What's going on?

85
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,515
- This isn't what it looks like!
- He just about took my head off.

86
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,471
I told you, I made a mistake, OK?
I'm sorry, all right?

87
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,189
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm... I'm Ludwig. I'm Jason Ludwig.

88
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,909
- I'm the robotics engineer.
- Do you always greet people this way?

89
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,310
I heard a noise. I thought it was him.
I was protecting myself.

90
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,118
You know, self-preservation?

91
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,193
Who did you think I was that you thought
you had to protect yourself?

92
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,271
Trepkos.

93
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,829
Sometimes he wouldn't talk to us for days.
Then, boom! You couldn't get him to shut up.

94
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,911
Don't get me wrong, OK?

95
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,673
No one revered the man more than me.

96
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,593
I mean... he was a prophet...

97
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,118
...an oracle.

98
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,838
He saw things.

99
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,390
L-I... I mean, he...
he saw things that you and me...

100
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,476
...we only dream about...

101
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,552
...and then forget when we wake up.

102
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,438
Well, it's OK, you can come out now.
The cavalry's here.

103
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,111
This is Peter Tanaka, our systems analyst.

104
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,876
<i>(Tanaka coughs)</i>

105
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,391
And, uh, this is Jesse O'Neil.

106
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,077
Are you the rescue team?

107
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,879
- No, we're with the FBI.
- FBI?

108
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,751
But you're taking us back, right?

109
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,749
- After we've investigated what happened.
- Trepkos is what happened.

110
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,031
- Did he kill Erikson?
- He flipped out.

111
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,311
Right after the descent, he just flipped out.

112
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,632
Can you think of anything that might've
caused or contributed to his behaviour?

113
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,076
- You're asking me?
- Daniel was sick.

114
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,277
He had a bipolar disorder.
I think that's what it was.

115
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,592
It wasn't a secret, but it's not
something he advertised either.

116
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,274
But with his medication he was just fine.

117
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,630
Well, I think Erikson's wife
might disagree with that.

118
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,194
You're part of the team, Jesse?

119
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,637
Daniel was my thesis advisor
at the university.

120
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,748
He asked me to assist him on this project.

121
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,990
- Are these his notes?
- Oh... yeah.

122
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,035
Well, whatever's left of 'em.

123
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,914
First thing he did was
destroy all his own work.

124
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,231
You know, his field journals,
his computer disks.

125
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,914
We salvaged what we could, but...

126
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,912
...I don't really think
you'll find much in there.

127
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,235
Of use, anyway.

128
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,388
- <i>(bird takes flight)</i>
- Hello?

129
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,989
Anyone there?

130
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,911
Scully.

131
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,438
What d'you make
of Mr Trepkos's neighbourhood?

132
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,718
- What d'you mean?
- Isn't their behaviour bizarre? Paranoid?

133
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,237
- After what they've been through, no.
- They're practically climbing the walls.

134
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,153
They've been living in
the middle of nowhere for a year.

135
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,834
One is dead, probably
at the hands of another.

136
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,310
You have to expect some heightened level
of emotional distress.

137
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,676
It's more than that. There's
something they're not telling us.

138
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,955
Based on what?

139
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,350
Based on when Ludwig
tried to play T-ball with my head.

140
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,795
He knew I wasn't Trepkos.

141
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,997
- Now Mulder, <i>you're</i> sounding paranoid.
- Pierce knows these people.

142
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,958
Let's find out what he thinks.

143
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,871
OK.

144
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,193
No one... can leave.

I've found him! I've found him!

151
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,191
I've found him!

152
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,112
- That should do it.
- What shall we do with the body?

153
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,838
- Do you have a freezer?
- Yeah.

154
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,435
- Radio for the helicopter. I'm almost done.
- Let me help you.

155
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,829
No, that's OK, we got him.

156
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,875
- We can't leave, Scully. Not yet.
- Why not?

157
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,316
- Trepkos is still out there.
- He killed Pierce and probably Erikson.

158
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,233
- We should come back with a larger party.
- No.

159
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,000
I've been going over Trepkos's work. I found
references to a subterranean organism.

160
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,719
- What?
- An organism existing within the volcano.

161
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,950
No specific description...

162
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,713
Mulder, nothing can live
in a volcanic interior.

163
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,429
Not only because of the intense heat,
but the gasses would be toxic.

164
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,795
What does this say?

165
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,390
It describes the metabolism from
hydrogen sulphide into silicon dioxide.

166
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,311
A silicon-based life form?

167
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,915
The basic building block for every
organism known to man is carbon.

168
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,471
- From bacterium to redwood trees.
- Silicon is the closest element to carbon.

169
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,792
It reacts identically with other elements -
it combines to form complex molecules.

170
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,395
A silicon-based life form is one of
the holy grails of modern science.

171
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,754
Maybe Trepkos found it.

172
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,914
Mulder, that is science fiction. It's... an
elaborate construct from a delusional mind.

173
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,116
This doesn't prove anything.

174
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,715
Trepkos said he had evidence.
It's gotta be here somewhere.

175
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,352
- Whatever evidence he had, he destroyed.
- Maybe it wasn't Trepkos who destroyed it.

176
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,035
- What if it was one of the others?
- Why would they do that?

177
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,117
All of these people are suffering to
varying degrees from post-traumatic stress.

178
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,718
And from a medical point of view, we have to
get them out of here sooner rather than later.

179
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,309
<i>(knock at door)</i>

180
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,071
Jesse?

181
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,271
Can I talk to you?

182
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,151
Are you OK?

183
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,874
I hate this place.

184
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,994
What happened here, Jesse?

185
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,469
You can trust me.

186
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,869
After the first descent...

187
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,951
...Daniel changed.

188
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,235
He became withdrawn and paranoid.

189
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,359
He locked himself in the lab
for three days and wouldn't let any of us in.

190
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,113
Do you think the descent
triggered his breakdown?

191
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,316
Well, that's what I thought.

192
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,073
And then... I found out...

193
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,193
...that he's not taking his pills.

194
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,115
Lithium carbonate.

195
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,192
Yeah, he said that
they were polluting his brain.

196
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,113
And... he said I was polluting his body.

197
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,635
I'm scared.

198
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,269
- I don't wanna die here.
- What are you so afraid of, Jesse?

199
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,471
Daniel.

200
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,989
The only reason I even came here
was because of him.

201
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,315
He promised me
that this would be an adventure.

202
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,875
That it would change my life.

203
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,519
But eight months is a long time,
and I just wanna go home now.

204
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,592
Where's home?

205
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,470
Anywhere but here.

206
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,552
<i>(Trepkos on tape) Samples 7, 12 and 22 also</i>
<i>contain trace evidence of the organism.</i>

207
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,634
<i>The possibility of this new,</i>
<i>or perhaps unfathomably old, life form...</i>

208
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,919

<i>If my intense desire to find the truth</i>
<i>hasn't finally eclipsed the truth itself.</i>

<i>My mind is a tangled knot</i>
<i>I can no longer untie.</i>

213
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,791
<i>Daily, I fight the urge to sever it completely</i>
<i>to stop this descent.</i>

214
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,511
<i>(tremor)</i>

215
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,715
What caused that tremor?

216
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,995
There's been a lot of seismic activity
in the northeast rift zone.

217
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,790
If Trepkos hadn't destroyed our instruments,
we might have learned something from it.

218
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,269
- <i>(coughs)</i>
- You feeling all right?

219
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,589
Yeah.

220
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,831
Agent Scully's a medical doctor.
Let her take a look at you.

221
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,036
- I'm fine.
- Just let her take a look...

222
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,473
No!

223
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,918
I'll go get Scully.

224
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,476
- Come on, get up. She'll help you.
- I don't want her to!

225
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,313
Of course you do! It's for the best.

226
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,950
We have to get out of here.

227
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,798
He just collapsed after the tremor.
He seems pretty bad.

228
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,640
- He's burning up.
- What is it?

229
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,429
An infection or a toxic reaction.
We've gotta get him to a hospital.

230
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,830
- I'll get a stretcher.
- We can'tjust leave Trepkos.

231
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,229
Give me the shortwave.

232
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,394
This is Agent Scully with the Firewalker
team. Come in, Search and Rescue.

233
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,512
I'll get O'Neil
and meet you at the landing site.

234
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,192
<i>This is Search and Rescue.</i>

235
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,238
Request dispatch of medevac immediately.

236
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,154
We have an Asian male, mid-thirties,
spiking a high-grade fever.

Peter, come on, get back here!

243
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,597
There.

244

<i>(choking)</i>

245
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,350

246
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,035
- Let me go! What're you doing? Let go of me!
- Don't go down there.

247
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,588
For God's sakes, he needs our help!

248
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,638
So what is it, Scully?
What are we dealing with?

249
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,837
Without better imaging equipment,
I can't say for sure.

250
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,309
I'll take any theory you've got.

251
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,757
- It appears to be some kind of a fungus.
- Anything you recognise?

252
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,789
Well, I'm not a botanist, but I think it's
fair to guess that it's an unknown genus.

253
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,630
- What am I looking at here?
- Spores.

254
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,518
I scraped them off the tip of the fungus.

255
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,157
It appears as if one of the spores grew inside
Tanaka until it reached reproductive maturity.

256
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,231
Essentially outgrowing its host.

257
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,348
But by then it had caused massive tissue
damage, particularly to the respiratory tract.

258
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,069
- That accounts for the sand in his lungs.
- You found sand in his lungs?

259
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,199
Silicon dioxide. The waste product
of a silicon-based organism.

260
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,639
Wait a second. There... there's no such thing
as a silicon-based organism.

261
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,995
Maybe now there is.

262
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,319
But we won't have proof until
we determine its molecular structure.

263
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,198
Come on. How else do you explain
the sand in his lungs?

264
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,398
It's the best trace evidence
we could ask for. Trepkos was right.

265
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,275
Daniel knew about this?

266
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,796
He discovered a spore
in the samples Firewalker brought up.

267
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,233
He would've told us.

268
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,791
Not if what he discovered was
too disturbing even for him to understand.

269
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,476
This might explain something else.
The spore could explain Trepkos's dementia.

270
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,438
Fungi contain alkaloids
that affect the nervous system.

271
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,149
Yeah, but what about us?
I mean... we weren't exposed.

272
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,756
We don't know that. If it was an airborne
microbe, any of us could've inhaled a spore.

273
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,070
So we're not going home, right?

274
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,357
Not until we know how it's transmitted,
how it incubates.

275
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,389
If even one of us is infected, we could risk
infecting a much larger population.

276
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,433
Search and Rescue, this is
Agent Mulder. Do you copy?

277
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,557
<i>This is Search and Rescue.</i>
<i>We're in a holding pattern. Over.</i>

278
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,397
Notify FBI District HQ in Spokane that we're
in quarantine due to possible contagion.

279
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,631
Have CDC send up an evacuation unit
on high alert.

280
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,109
<i>What's the nature of the contagion?</i>

281
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,310
<i>Agent Mulder?</i>

282
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,951
Tell them it's a biological agent...
of unknown origin.

283
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,235
<i>That's affirmative. Standing by.</i>

284
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,799
Maybe you should go check up on O'Neil.

285
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,589
I'm gonna go find Trepkos.

286
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,235
- What if he's already dead?
- He'll find it tough answering my questions.

287
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,595
I've gotta find out what he knows.

288
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,309
It could change our understanding
of the origin and evolution of life.

289
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,710
He's dangerous, Mulder.
He's already killed two men.

290
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,475
- Then I have to find out why.
- Will you at least let me go with you?

291
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,788
No.

292
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,158
Look, I know what you're thinking,
but you have to get past that. We both do.

293
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,516
I'm back... and I'm not going anywhere.

294
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,477
You have to finish the autopsy on Tanaka.

295
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:43,714
Hopefully that'll give us a better idea
of what we're dealing with - whatever it is.

296
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,759
I'm counting on you to keep us all
from ending up on that slab.

297
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,112
- Do like we said, OK?
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

298
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,236
You know what to say, right?

299
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,595
I could use a little help.

300
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,311
Excuse me.

301
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,358
- So what do you need?
- Directions, a contour map, USGS survey.

302
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,829
Anything that can help me get here.

303
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,991
Oh.

304
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,480
These are the steam caves.

305
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,315
They feed into the Sherman Crater.
That's how we access the caldera.

306
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,914
- How did you get these?
- Firewalker.

307
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,790
They were transmitted right before
Trepkos destroyed his camera.

308
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,359
Oh!

309
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,159
So you're finally gonna go after Trepkos?

310
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,109
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

311
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,033
You won't find him with those.

312
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,159
- And you won't find him with any map either.
- How will I find him?

313
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,231
You won't.

314
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,998
- Not without a guide.
- A guide?

315
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,117
Yeah, a guide.
I've been up here for almost a year.

316
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,509
I spent months in those caves...

317
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,832
...charting every fissure, every crevice,
so Firewalker wouldn't trip.

318
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,798
If Trepkos is there, I can find him.

319
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,429
- Why are you so eager to help me find him?
- Oh, I'm... I'm not eager.

320
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:35,556
I just don't want to wait around for Trepkos to
do to me what he did to Pierce and Erikson.

321
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,870
Plus, you've got the gun.

322
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,950
You're the only one
who can get us out of this place.

323
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,069
Whatever I'm smelling, is it toxic?

324
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,359
Between the heat and the sulphur, it can get
pretty nasty in here. But it won't hurt you.

325
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,715
You'll get used to it.

326
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,477
- How far does the cave extend?
- Three quarters of a mile, to the crater rim.

327
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,235
Let's head in.

328
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,631
It twists around quite a bit
till you get there. Lots of dead ends...

329
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,996
...and blind drops.

330
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,676
Unless you know where you're going,
you're... like a rat in a maze.

331
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,670
Argh! Argh!

332
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,991
Argh!

333
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,711
Your gun.

334
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,476
Back. Get back.

335
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,237
Why are you doing this, Trepkos?
He's already dead.

336
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,471
How many times do you have to kill him?

337
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,880
It's not him I'm trying to kill.

338
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,235
I have attempted to culture the spore, using
temperatures ranging from human basal...

339
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,596
...to those approximating
the volcanic interior.

340
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,990
I have used nutritive mediums containing...

341
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,713
...human tissue, blood and saliva.
Even sulphur.

342
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,189
However, none of the seven trials...

343
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,319
...have successfully grown
the fungus that killed Tanaka.

344
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,554
Based on this preliminary data,
I have come to the following hypothesis:

345
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,232
...That unless the spores are ingested
or inhaled by the host organism...

346
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,118
...immediately upon their release...

347
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,395
...they become harmless...

348
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,596
...effectively dead.

349
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,111
Jesse?

350
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,395
<i>(Jesse)</i> What is it?

351
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,678
I thought you'd like to know - the chances
are good that none of us were infected.

352
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,478
<i>(choking)</i>

353
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:28,032
We were a safe distance from Tanaka. When
Mulder and Ludwig come back, we can leave.

354
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,193
I... I just need to run a few more tests,
but I think we're gonna be OK.

355
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,431
Ow. Oooh.

356
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,235
OK, Jesse? Jesse?

357
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,189
<i>(Mulder)</i> What went wrong, Trepkos?

358
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,310
Firewalker carried something back
to the surface.

359
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,114
Firewalker brought up an elephant.

360
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,070
The truth...

361
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,550
...is an elephant described by three blind men.

362
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,590
The first man touches the tail
and says it's a rope.

363
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,678
The second man feels the rough leg
and says it's a tree.

364
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,358
The third man feels the trunk
and says it's a snake.

365
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,552
What about you? What do you say it is?

366
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,439
I say the earth holds some truths
best left buried.

367
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,189
Like the spore?

368
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,198
- Who are you?
- I'm Special Agent Mulder. I'm with the FBI.

369
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,877
You don't look like a policeman.

370
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,918
I came down here to investigate
Erikson's death.

371
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,389
That's not why you're here.

372
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:55,193
You still believe you can petition heaven
and get some penetrating answer.

373
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,909
If you found that answer...

374
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,515
...what would you do with it?

375
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,989
I just wanna know what happened
after the first descent.

376
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,155
What did you find?

377
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,995
It was porous...

378
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,991
...obsidian.

379
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,960
Erikson thought it was some sort of rock,
so I told him to pulverise it for analysis.

380
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,555
- Erikson released the spore?
- He discovered a new life form.

381
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,952
In a single moment, all that science
held sacred suddenly turned on its head.

382
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,831
- What about Erikson? Lf... if he was infected...
- I was too immersed in the work to notice.

383
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,715
I'd been alone in the lab for three days...
when I heard their screams.

384
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,429
They were all gathered around him.

385
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,110
By the time I realised what was happening,
they were already changing.

386
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,557
The spore... grew in each of them
until it became...

387
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,949
What do you mean?

388
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,235
It's a parasite.

389
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,073
It lives to find a host.

390
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,799
- But you weren't infected?
- No.

391
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,514
You destroyed your work, the equipment.

392
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,512
You killed Pierce... so no one could leave.

393
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,270
No one <i>can</i> leave.

394
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,314
What about O'Neil?

395
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,118
Jesse?

396
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,432
- Was she exposed to the spore?
- They were all exposed.

397
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,748
- All of them.
- I have a colleague, a friend...

398
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,994
...who's with O'Neil right now.

399
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,959
- Let me go to her.
- She may already be infected.

400
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,316
I can't let you leave.

401
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,074
Then you're gonna have to shoot me.

402
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,269
Because I'm walking outta here.

403
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,871
Jesse?

404
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,272
Oh!

405
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,639
God, you scared me!

406
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,117
- <i>(laboured breathing)</i>
- Jesse?

407
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,998
- Are you OK?
- <i>(choking)</i>

408
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,958
Jesse, what's wrong? Jesse?

409
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,589
Jesse, what are you doing?

410
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,072

411
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,991

413
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,953
Scully?

414
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,351
Scully?

415
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,431
I'm OK. I'm OK.

416
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,109
- You all right?
- I'm OK.

417
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,994
Yeah.

418
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,310
Mulder, look...

419
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,635
...she was infected. I don't know how.

420
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,995
Erikson was the original host.

421
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,312
When the fungus shed its spores, everyone
was at ground zero, except for Trepkos.

422
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,630
Did you find him?

423
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,679
I told her... it would change her life.

424
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,593
Search and Rescue,
this is Agent Mulder. Do you copy?

425
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,070
<i>This is Army Biohazard.</i>
<i>How many are in your party?</i>

426
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,992
We have two survivors -
Agent Scully and myself.

427
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,470
<i>Copy that. Our ETA is seven minutes.</i>

428
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,189
Mulder, what are you doing?
They're gonna wanna question him.

429
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,635
It's all over, Scully.

430
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,710
He won't talk.

431
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,992
<i>Scully and I are in the third day</i>
<i>of a month's quarantine...</i>

<i>... undergoing level four decon procedures.</i>

433
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,953
<i>We are, so far, without symptoms</i>
<i>of fungal contamination.</i>

434
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,269
<i>Our specimens and field notes were taken by</i>

435

<i>the arrival of the USGS data retrieval team.</i>

436
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,750
<i>I suspect, though, there will be</i>
<i>little left for them to retrieve.</i>

437
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:56,756
<i>There are no plans to explore the volcanically</i>
<i>active mountains in the Cascade range...</i>

438

<i>... including Mount Avalon.</i>

439
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,550
<i>All access points to that volcano</i>
<i>have been sealed off by army engineers.</i>
