1
00:00:02,215 --> 00:00:03,682
l'm here in Pasadena

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,911
with the NASA
mission control team

3
00:00:05,986 --> 00:00:08,352
as they celebrate
scientific history--

4
00:00:08,422 --> 00:00:12,017
the first close-up photographic
transmissions of Mars

5
00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:14,458
from the Viking Observer
spacecraft--

6
00:00:14,528 --> 00:00:19,864
photos that have created a stir
by revealing surprising
geologic information:

7
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:22,424
the presence of
large amounts ofwater

8
00:00:22,502 --> 00:00:24,561
locked in Mars'
polar ice caps--

9
00:00:24,671 --> 00:00:27,196
water that some speculate
could have possibly

10
00:00:27,307 --> 00:00:28,934
sustained life
on the planet.

11
00:00:29,042 --> 00:00:33,502
Even more controversial is
one image ofa land formation--

12
00:00:33,613 --> 00:00:37,071
a formation that looks like
a sculpted human face.

13
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,551
However, NASA officials are
denying it as an indication

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,212
ofan alien civilization.

15
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:45,656
lt's nothing more than a trick
oflight and shadows--

16
00:00:45,726 --> 00:00:46,818
a geologic anomaly.

17
00:00:46,893 --> 00:00:48,417
The only sculptors at work

18
00:00:48,495 --> 00:00:51,794
are the solarwinds that blow
across the surface of Mars

19
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:54,425
at 300 miles an hour,
ten months a year.

20
00:01:30,937 --> 00:01:33,997
l'm seeing--
l've got--

21
00:01:34,107 --> 00:01:35,506
How's it going out there?

22
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:37,236
There's something out here.

23
00:01:37,344 --> 00:01:38,902
Can you repeat that,
Commander?

24
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:41,139
lt's coming at me!

25
00:01:41,214 --> 00:01:42,681

What did the note say?

00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:27,872
just that they
worked for NASA.

60
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:30,075
Theywanted to talk to somebody

61
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,549
from the F.B.l.

62
00:04:31,618 --> 00:04:34,485
Why the cloak-and-dagger
routine?

63
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:35,680
l have no idea.

64
00:04:35,755 --> 00:04:36,881
Think it's a crank?

65
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:39,790
lt's beginning to look that way.

66
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:54,339
My name is
Michelle Generoo.

67
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:55,704
Fox Mulder.

68
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:57,402
l sentyou the note.

69
00:04:57,477 --> 00:04:58,876
Special Agent
Dana Scully.

70
00:04:58,945 --> 00:05:01,675
l'm sorry to have
to take these precautions.

71
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:04,012
l few up from Houston
this morning.

72
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:06,109
l work
at the space center there.

73
00:05:06,186 --> 00:05:08,484
ln what capacity?

74
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:11,456
l'm the Mission Control
Communications Commander

75
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:12,684
for the shuttle.

76
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:14,487
What brings you to Washington?

77
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:18,086
There may be a saboteur
at work inside NASA.

78
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:20,530
You have evidence ofsabotage?

79
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,965
l don't know. l may.

80
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:22,967
Two weeks ago

81
00:05:23,036 --> 00:05:24,663
a shuttle mission
was scrubbed

82
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:26,330
three seconds before lift-off

83
00:05:26,406 --> 00:05:28,966
when an auxiliary
power unit valve malfunctioned.

84
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:30,907
lfthe fight
had not been aborted

85
00:05:30,977 --> 00:05:32,410
there was a great chance

86
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,640
the liquid fuel system
and the orbiter

87
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:36,875
would have exploded
on the launch pad.

88
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,578
This was sent to me
in the mail.

89
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:44,452
lt's a material analysis

90
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:46,515
that shows deep-grooved
scoring marks

91
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:48,493
inside this A.P.U. valve--

92
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:51,928
marks that could have
caused a malfunction.

93
00:05:51,998 --> 00:05:53,659
Evidence oftampering?

94
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:55,758
That's what it looks like,
but...

95
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:58,633
According to the person
who gave meyour names

96
00:05:58,705 --> 00:05:59,831
you have expertise

97
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:01,498
in unexplained
phenomena.

98
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:02,836
And what's unexplainable

99
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:05,070
is how anybody
could have done it.

100
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:06,612
How doyou mean?

101
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,274
The valve is made
offerrocarbon titanium.

102
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:10,577
To score that material

103
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,845
would take extreme
launch pad temperatures.

104
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:14,784
lf NASA looked
at that analysis

105
00:06:14,854 --> 00:06:19,791
theywould say no one could do
that type ofdamage undetected.

106
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:22,157
Doyou have any idea
who sent that toyou?

107
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:23,923
No idea.

108
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,430
The official analysis
ofthe malfunction

109
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:28,023
was simple
mechanical failure.

110
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:30,295
Does anybody
shareyour suspicions?

111
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,270
lfthey do

112
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:34,772
they're not talking
to the F.B.l.

113
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:39,335
l believe in the space program
and the people who run it

114
00:06:39,412 --> 00:06:41,778
but there's
another launch window tomorrow.

115
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:44,180
My reasons may sound selfish,
but my fiance

116
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,616
is a Shuttle Commander
on that mission.

117
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:53,155
Scully: Whywould somebodywant
to sabotage the Space Shuttle?

118
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:55,193
Well, ifyou were
a terrorist

119
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:58,025
there probably isn't
a more potent symbol

120
00:06:58,098 --> 00:06:59,588
ofAmerican progress
and prosperity.

121
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,633
lfyou're an opponent
ofbig science

122
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:03,965
NASA itselfrepresents
a vast money trench

123
00:07:04,037 --> 00:07:06,938
that exists outside
the crucible and debate

124
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:08,496
ofthe democratic process.

125
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:10,736
And, ofcourse,
there are those futurists

126
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,608
who believe the Space Shuttle
is a rusty old bucket--

127
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,705
a dinosaur spacecraft
built in the '70s

128
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:18,012
by scientists
setting their sights on space

129
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:19,176
in an ever-declining scale.

130
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:20,810
And we thought
we could rest easy

131
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:23,947
with the fall
ofthe Soviet Union.

132
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:26,116
Not to mention
certain fringe elements

133
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:29,059
who accuse our government itself
ofspace sabotage--

134
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:31,063
the failure
ofthe Hubble Telescope

135
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:32,257
and the Mars Observer

136
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:34,230
are directly connected
to a conspiracy

137
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,460
to deny us evidence.

138
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:37,059
Evidence ofwhat?

139
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:40,038
Alien civilizations.

140
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:41,471
Oh, ofcourse.

141
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:51,776
Look at that--
GeminiEight.

142
00:07:51,851 --> 00:07:53,113
What?

143
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:54,813
The man we're seeing--
Colonel Belt--

144
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:56,788
nearly died on that mission.

145
00:07:56,856 --> 00:07:58,187
Made an emergency landing

146
00:07:58,258 --> 00:08:00,249
in the middle
ofthe Pacific Ocean.

147
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,793
You remember that stuff?

148
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:03,761
You neverwanted to be an astronaut
when you were a kid?

149
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,457
l missed
that phase.

150
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:09,865
Comein.

151
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:12,734
Colonel Belt.

152
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:14,239
l'm special agent
Dana Scully.

153
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:15,899
And this is...

154
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:17,442
Colonel Belt.

155
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,637
Fox Mulder. l'm a big fan.

156
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:22,647
lt's an honor
to meetyou.

157
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:24,683
You were a big hero to me.

158
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:25,775
Thankyou.

159
00:08:25,852 --> 00:08:27,911
l stayed up all night
when l was 1 4

160
00:08:27,987 --> 00:08:29,818
to watch your space walk.

161
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:33,188
Well, now it's like
a stroll around the block.

162
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:38,125
So... how can l helpyou?

163
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:42,157
This found its way
to the F.B.l.

164
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,063
Doyou recognize it?

165
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:50,666
Sure. lt's an auxiliary
power unit valve.

166
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:52,904
Doyou have
any reason to believe

167
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:54,640
that the damage done to it

168
00:08:54,714 --> 00:08:57,706
was in an effort to sabotage
the Space Shuttle program?

169
00:08:57,784 --> 00:09:00,014
No.

170
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:02,748
Any reason
to suspect sabotage at all?

171
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:04,187
No reason whatsoever.

172
00:09:04,257 --> 00:09:07,522
And ifyou have any respect
for this program

173
00:09:07,627 --> 00:09:09,993
and for the people who have
devoted their lives to it

174
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:12,429
you'll be careful
to whom you make

175
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:13,965
those accusations.

176
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,262
Looking at this evidence, sir

177
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:18,964
would you consider postponing
the shuttle fight

178
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:20,699
until a full investigation

179
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:23,207
could be conducted?

180
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:26,074
l don't know whereyou got
this specious artifact

181
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:28,113
but every precaution
has been taken

182
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:29,341
to rectify the problem.

183
00:09:29,415 --> 00:09:31,679
We've been waiting
two weeks

184
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:34,618
for a window to initiate
this mission.

185
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:36,655
We've got a payload to deliver.

186
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:40,420
Has an internal investigation
ever been done on this matter?

187
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:41,993
The partyou have here

188
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:44,859
has been installed,
inspected, and designed

189
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:47,525
by over 1 00
highly trained technicians.

190
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,830
With the security measures
we take

191
00:09:49,903 --> 00:09:51,837
it would be virtually impossible

192
00:09:51,905 --> 00:09:53,964
for one man
working by himself

193
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,871
or two, or four men

194
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:58,467
to do what
you're suggesting.

195
00:09:58,544 --> 00:09:59,943
l can assureyou

196
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:01,571
there isn't a person
in this facility

197
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:03,878
that doesn't want to see
that shuttle go into space

198
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,781
complete its mission

199
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:08,343
and come back
like winged Victory herself.

200
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:11,515
And in about ten hours,
God willing

201
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:13,320
you'll seejust that.

202
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:15,826
Doyou think
there would be a problem

203
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:18,728
with us watching the lift-off
from mission control?

204
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:23,098
Well, being thatyou'd probably
go over my head anyway

205
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:23,760
please, be my guest.

206
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:26,737
lt was an honor, sir.

207
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:28,535
Thankyou.

208
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:35,136
Didn'tyou want
to get his autograph?

209
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:40,642
Man: Where did you
sayyou got this?

210
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,745
Scully: lt came to us
anonymously.

211
00:10:42,822 --> 00:10:44,949
This is an A.P.U. valve,
all right.

212
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:46,592
This doesn't make sense.

213
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:47,818
What doesn't
make sense?

214
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:49,225
This scoring here.

215
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:52,287
This valve is made out
offerrocarbon titanium.

216
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:53,889
You didn't order the analysis?

217
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:56,868
No, but we're
on outside contract to NASA.

218
00:10:56,936 --> 00:10:59,461
They may have ordered it.

219
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:02,040
Wouldn'tyou order
a material analysis

220
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:03,472
ifa part malfunctioned?

221
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:07,502
Every shuttle has fown with
that same valve with no problem.

222
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:10,275
To do an analysis would delay
the program for months

223
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,443
not to mention
the cost.

224
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:14,179
ln order to avoid delays

225
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:16,278
is the program
being pushed ahead

226
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:18,256
without proper
safety precaution?

227
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:19,882
There are about 1 7,000 things

228
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:22,291
that can go wrong
with the shuttle

229
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:25,297
and about 1 7,000 people
who make sure they don't.

230
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:27,458
Who makes
the final determination

231
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:28,761
as to its safety?

232
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:30,097
We make a recommendation

233
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:32,831
but ultimately, the decision
is Colonel Belt's.

234
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:35,203
- Thankyou.
- Thankyou.

235
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:41,914
What doyou think?

236
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:44,813
l can't believe how much faith
we put in machines.

237
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:47,751
You think Colonel Belt
knows more than he's saying?

238
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,482
He lied about his knowledge
ofa saboteur?

239
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:52,353
l can't believe
Colonel Belt

240
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:54,689
would endanger the lives
ofthose astronauts

241
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:57,286
knowing that something
might go wrong.

242
00:11:57,363 --> 00:11:58,591
He was
an astronaut himself.

243
00:11:58,664 --> 00:12:02,259
Soyou think
this X ray is bogus?

244
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:04,030
God, l hope so.

lt ranks right up there
with getting a pony

292

293
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,684
You have to admit
that was exciting--

294
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:38,485
Mission control,
countdown...

295
00:14:38,558 --> 00:14:40,287
Mulder! Wait!

00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:41,883
Something's
gone wrong.

297
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:43,326
What happened?

298
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:45,455
Something's wrong
with the shuttle.

299
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:48,364
We had some trouble
with the solid rocket boosters

300
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:49,765
but we fixed it.

301
00:14:49,835 --> 00:14:51,598
Got a phone call
20 minutes ago.

302
00:14:51,671 --> 00:14:54,572
Communication with the shuttle
had gone down.

303
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,767
We've got to get back
to Houston.

304
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,845
They have a press blackout
in effect.

305
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:12,686
Chances are, the media
doesn't know about it.

306
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:13,690
Sabotage?

307
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:15,750
Things go wrong all the time.

308
00:15:15,795 --> 00:15:17,387
But they usually fix them.

309
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:18,953
Usually.

310
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:20,020
She's turning.

311
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,657
Michelle!

312
00:15:56,736 --> 00:15:57,998
l can see her.

313
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,094
Michelle!

314
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:00,467
Help!

315
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:01,767
You all right?

316
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:03,671
l'm stuck!

317
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:05,301
Can you move?

318
00:16:05,411 --> 00:16:07,641
just get me out ofhere!

319
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:09,681
l'm wedged in.

320
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:10,840
You all right?

321
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,816
l'm wedged in.

322
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:14,079
Come here.

323
00:16:14,153 --> 00:16:16,018
Can you push with your legs?

324
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:17,282
Be careful.

325
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:19,119
just get me out ofhere!

326
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:21,421
Come on. Okay.

327
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,994
lt's okay.

328
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:37,909
Don't try to move.

329
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:41,435
Oh, l got to get back
to Houston.

330
00:16:44,483 --> 00:16:45,575
What happened?

331
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:46,675
l don't know.

332
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:49,619
Something came at me
in the fog

333
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:53,716
and next thing l knew,
l was upside down.

334
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:55,954
Was it some kind ofan animal?

335
00:16:56,028 --> 00:16:57,723
No. lt had a face.

336
00:16:57,797 --> 00:16:59,355
lt was...

337
00:16:59,432 --> 00:17:01,900
lt was grotesque.

338
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:04,435
l don't know what it was.

339
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:10,040
You okay?

340
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,701
Yeah.

341
00:17:17,516 --> 00:17:18,949
Orbiter, this is Houston.

342
00:17:19,018 --> 00:17:21,953
Doyou copy?

343
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:24,182
Your transmission
isbreaking up, Houston.

344
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:27,583
What's happening?

345
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,220
A malfin the O.M.S.
and R.C.F. systems.

346
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:32,958
They can't get the orbiter
into attitude rotation.

347
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:34,556
Cabin temperature is 1 03

348
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:36,157
and they have
downlink transmission...

349
00:17:36,235 --> 00:17:37,395
What happened toyou?

350
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,698
l had an
accident.

351
00:17:38,804 --> 00:17:39,930
What's their position?

352
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:42,337
just over eastern Africa.

353
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:45,069
Try patching them into the Seychelles
Tracking Station.

354
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:47,145
All right.

355
00:17:49,248 --> 00:17:52,240
Hang in there, O.T.C.

356
00:17:52,318 --> 00:17:54,650
The orbiter maneuvering systems
malfunctioned.

357
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,917
They need to rotate the shuttle
away from the sun

358
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,480
to keep the orbiter cool.

359
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:02,823
Drop in cabin pressure
21 kilopascals and declining.

360
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:05,557
They're going to burn up.

361
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:06,757
Where's Colonel Belt?

362
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:07,767
On his way.

363
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:08,324
On his way.

364
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:09,629
What happened?

365
00:18:09,702 --> 00:18:11,670
Backup system failed.

366
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:14,399
Can we auto-activate their
systems from down here?

367
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:15,599
We cannot.

368
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,676
lt's like
someone's screwing

369
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:20,245
with the uplink communications
from this end.

370
00:18:20,346 --> 00:18:21,278
Can you trace it?

371
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:23,212
Digital processor.

372
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:24,476
They'd have to be

373
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,245
in the data banks.

374
00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:27,080
Where's that?

375
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:28,780
Come on.

376
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,658

Mulder?

377
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:19,436
l'm a Federal Agent.

378
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:21,166
Come on out ofthere.

379
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:24,473

Let me seeyour clearance.

382
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:29,979
There was a malfunction
in one ofthe processors.

383
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:31,346
Did you find it?

384
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:32,406
No.

385
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:34,009
Did you see anybody else here?

386
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:36,645
Call security.

387
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:40,818
l don't want anybody coming
in or out ofthis building

388
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:42,416
who doesn't have
proper clearance.

( garbledtransmission )

390
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:46,662
What's the attitude
ofthe orbiter?

391
00:19:46,732 --> 00:19:47,892
They're fying

Flash evaporator system
is working

394
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:53,631
but it's not enough
to cool them down.

395
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:54,968
Cabin temperature 1 1 6.

396
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,268
Where's..?

397
00:19:56,342 --> 00:19:58,867
Somebody'sjamming
our transmissions.

398
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:00,343
Somebody or something

399
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:02,471
is interfering with
our ground communications

400
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:04,038
and scrambling
our uplink telemetry.

401
00:20:04,116 --> 00:20:06,414
The shuttle
is not responding

402
00:20:06,485 --> 00:20:10,353
to override signals.

403
00:20:10,422 --> 00:20:11,719
l'm cutting off
telemetry.

404
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,781
We might lose contact for good.

405
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:15,349
We have to give it a chance.

406
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:16,826
We have to bring them down.

407
00:20:16,896 --> 00:20:19,364
We have to give them
control ofthe ship

408
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:21,092
to perform
that rotation maneuver

409
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:21,962
and deliver the payload.

410
00:20:22,034 --> 00:20:23,626
What ifthey can't?

411
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:24,760
We could be stranding them.

412
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:34,003
Abandon telemetry.

413
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:36,047
Go to fy-by-wire mode.

414
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:40,980
They're cutting off
ground control to the orbiter.

415
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:43,283
The astronauts will be fying
the shuttle all by themselves.

416
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:45,289
ls it gonna work?

417
00:20:48,994 --> 00:20:50,985
O.T.C., this is Houston.

418

How's the weather up there?

419
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:55,333
Sunny and warm, Houston.

420
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:56,425
What's the forecast?

421
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:59,027
O.T.C., we're going
to fy-by-wire mode.

422
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:01,004
We're going
to abort ground control

423
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:03,633
to see ifyou can bring
those systems back up.

424
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:06,769
Roger that, Houston

425
00:21:06,845 --> 00:21:09,313

00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:54,749
They're lookinggood, sir.

448
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,788
Y'all get some rest.

How did he know
it was going to work?

463
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:44,168
He didn't.
They could have died

464
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:46,203
and there would
have been nothing

465
00:23:46,271 --> 00:23:47,568
we could have done.

466
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:50,039
They'd have been

stuck in orbit.

468
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:54,442
Whywould he take
that risk?

469
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:58,415
Bring those men back
without delivering that payload?

470
00:23:58,484 --> 00:24:01,214
That's millions
ofwasted dollars.

471
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:04,653
That's all congress would need
to shut down NASA.

Doyou think someone
is sabotaging the shuttle?

to bring those men back

They don't know.

528

Theyjust said
it was a thump.

529
00:29:01,653 --> 00:29:03,120
An astronomer
in Winnipeg

00:29:03,221 --> 00:29:04,916
just spotted
a gaseous cloud

a mile long
trailing in our orbit.

That's the liquid O2
leaking into space.

How much time
do they have?

We're doing
the calculations

537
00:29:17,636 --> 00:29:19,934
but it will be
a guesstimate.

538
00:29:20,005 --> 00:29:21,336
l need some answers.

539
00:29:21,406 --> 00:29:23,033
And where is Colonel Belt?

00:29:23,108 --> 00:29:25,338

00:29:26,745 --> 00:29:28,144
Houston? We're wondering

543
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:30,613
when wehave
tostartholdingourbreath.

544
00:29:30,682 --> 00:29:32,047
We're working on it.

545
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:35,518
l need those calculations
and a worst-case scenario.

546
00:29:35,587 --> 00:29:38,147
We don't know ifboth O2 tanks
are damaged.

547
00:29:38,223 --> 00:29:39,383
Worst-case scenario!

548
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:41,221
And someone find Colonel Belt.

549
00:29:41,293 --> 00:29:43,158
We'll find Colonel Belt.

550
00:29:43,228 --> 00:29:47,324
They've got 30 minutes
ofbackup oxygen.

551
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:48,866
Why does she need Belt?

552
00:29:48,934 --> 00:29:51,528
She doesn't know
how serious the leak is.

553
00:29:51,603 --> 00:29:52,934
lt's an oxygen leak.

554
00:29:53,004 --> 00:29:56,269
Even l know what happens
when you run out ofoxygen.

555
00:29:56,341 --> 00:29:59,003
Colonel Belt's been
in the same situation.

556
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:00,476
He'll know what to do.

557
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:02,342
Where the hell is he?

558
00:30:11,356 --> 00:30:12,687
Colonel Belt?

559
00:30:16,695 --> 00:30:19,255
Colonel Belt!

560
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:21,322
l'm going to go
get security.

561
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:24,163
Colonel Belt.

562
00:30:27,806 --> 00:30:29,899
Areyou all right?

563
00:30:29,975 --> 00:30:33,741
Yeah. l wasn't feeling well.

564
00:30:33,845 --> 00:30:35,813
They need you
at mission control.

565
00:30:35,914 --> 00:30:38,644
There's been
another accident.

566
00:30:38,717 --> 00:30:40,548
O.T.C.

567
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:42,985
ls your orbital maneuvering
system still operational?

568
00:30:43,054 --> 00:30:47,388
Roger, Houston. We're ready
forreentry. Justsay the word.

569
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:50,917
How bad's the leak?

570
00:30:50,996 --> 00:30:53,055
We have no way
to determine.

571
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:59,530
O.T.C., what's the condensation
on your cabin?

572
00:30:59,604 --> 00:31:01,663
Windowsaregetting
alittlesteamy.

573
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,674
Carbon dioxide buildup.

574
00:31:03,742 --> 00:31:05,505
Okay, O.T.C.

575
00:31:05,577 --> 00:31:07,545
Everything's going to be fine.

576
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:10,080
l wantyou
to get in your spacesuits

577
00:31:10,148 --> 00:31:12,981
and de-pressurize
your cabin.

578
00:31:13,051 --> 00:31:16,179
And then l wantyou
to vent that CO2.

579
00:31:16,254 --> 00:31:17,312
Andthen what?

580
00:31:17,389 --> 00:31:19,619
l wantyou to stay
in your suits.

581
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:22,216
l wantyou
to prepare to use

582
00:31:22,294 --> 00:31:24,319
your emergency oxygen systems.

583
00:31:24,396 --> 00:31:26,057
And then
l wantyou...

584
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:29,424
to...

585
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:31,628
deliveryour payload.

586
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:35,764
Those are men up there.

587
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,569
You're out ofline.

588
00:31:37,642 --> 00:31:40,634
You want to tell me
how to do myjob?

589
00:31:40,745 --> 00:31:43,714
l've been up there
in that situation, Miss Generoo.

590
00:31:43,782 --> 00:31:45,181
There's more
at risk here

591
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,717
than your
personal life.

592
00:31:46,785 --> 00:31:48,252
lfyou can't
accept that

593
00:31:48,353 --> 00:31:52,153
or operate effectively
in these circumstances

594
00:31:52,224 --> 00:31:54,852
then maybeyou'd better
leave the decisions

595
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:56,257
to people who can.

596
00:32:08,406 --> 00:32:10,636
O.T.C.

597
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:12,006
Doyou copy?

598
00:32:12,077 --> 00:32:16,605
Roger, Houston. We're waiting
on those O2 calculations.

599
00:32:19,284 --> 00:32:21,218
( sniffling )

600
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:25,617
Scully: Michelle!

601
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,317
They're going to die.

602
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,587
You don't know that.

603
00:32:29,661 --> 00:32:30,958
lt's unconscionable

604
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:33,156
putting that payload
before those men's lives.

605
00:32:33,231 --> 00:32:34,630
l think she's right.

606
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:36,291
He's losing it.

607
00:32:36,368 --> 00:32:38,199
He saved
their lives earlier.

608
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:41,535
Did he, or did he put
their lives injeopardy?

609
00:32:41,606 --> 00:32:43,597
lfhe can't deliver that payload

610
00:32:43,675 --> 00:32:45,267
Congress kills
the space program.

611
00:32:45,377 --> 00:32:48,244
Killing astronauts
won't have the same effect?

612
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:51,248
l think somebody must have
sabotaged the Space Shuttle.

613
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:55,013
l think Colonel Belt has known
about it from the beginning.

614
00:32:55,086 --> 00:32:57,520
We've got to stop him.

615
00:32:57,589 --> 00:33:00,114
We've got to pull them out
oforbit.

616
00:33:00,191 --> 00:33:02,421
He doesn't want
those men to die.

617
00:33:02,494 --> 00:33:04,086
He put them up there.

618
00:33:04,162 --> 00:33:08,064
He may be the only person
who can get them down alive.

619
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:11,068
How can you be certain
that what he's doing

620
00:33:11,136 --> 00:33:12,626
won't save their lives?

621
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,763
l need access
toyour records

622
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,431
in a hurry.

623
00:33:16,508 --> 00:33:18,772
Mulder: l need everything
on the Hubble Telescope

624
00:33:18,843 --> 00:33:20,811
the Mars Observer,
the Shuttle Challenger

625
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:22,403
and the current
orbiter mission.

626
00:33:22,514 --> 00:33:24,709
That's tens ofthousands
ofdocuments.

627
00:33:24,816 --> 00:33:25,908
What are we
looking for?

628
00:33:26,017 --> 00:33:28,485
X rays, diagrams,
schematics--

629
00:33:28,553 --> 00:33:30,851
any proofthat Belt knew
about a sabotage.

630
00:33:30,922 --> 00:33:32,890
A needle
in a haystack.

631
00:33:53,111 --> 00:33:54,908
Payloaddeployment
initiated.

632
00:33:57,115 --> 00:33:59,515
Roger that, O.T.C.
Tracking it now.

633
00:34:01,953 --> 00:34:04,285
Looksgoodfrom here.

634
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,661
Payloaddelivery
is complete, Houston.

635
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,994
We'reawaiting
yourorder.

636
00:34:14,065 --> 00:34:17,762
System check for reentry
de-orbit burn.

637
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,172
HolyGod, there'ssomething
outside theship--

638
00:34:21,172 --> 00:34:22,605
HolyGod, there'ssomething
outside theship--

639
00:34:22,674 --> 00:34:24,369
There'ssomeone
outside theship!

640
00:34:24,442 --> 00:34:25,909
Can you repeat that, O.T.C.?

641
00:34:25,977 --> 00:34:29,105
There'ssome
kindofghost

642
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,671
outside theship!

643
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,116
No!

644
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:39,249
( whimpering )
No, no, no!

645
00:34:39,357 --> 00:34:41,325
( screaming )

646
00:34:46,297 --> 00:34:47,389
Mulder

647
00:34:47,465 --> 00:34:48,796
l found it.

648
00:34:48,867 --> 00:34:52,234
This is the same diagram
that was sent to Michelle.

649
00:34:55,273 --> 00:34:57,207
Ordered by Colonel Belt,

650
00:34:57,275 --> 00:34:59,675
which means he knew
about the faultyvalve.

651
00:34:59,744 --> 00:35:01,405
This is from the Challenger.

652
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:03,413
lt's the O-ring fitting
that failed.

653
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:04,846
lt's dated

654
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:07,350
one week before
the Space Shuttle blew up.

655
00:35:07,419 --> 00:35:09,944
The analysis was ordered
by Colonel Belt.

656
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:11,784
You're saying
he might have known

657
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,482
about the Challenger defect?

658
00:35:13,591 --> 00:35:15,081
Something weird

659
00:35:15,193 --> 00:35:16,683
is going on
here, Scully.

660
00:35:16,795 --> 00:35:17,819
Colonel Belt's collapsed.

661
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:19,863
He's in his office.

662
00:35:23,101 --> 00:35:25,729
He wasjust here.

663
00:35:25,804 --> 00:35:27,533
( whimpering )

664
00:35:29,574 --> 00:35:31,804
Scully: Oh, my God.

665
00:35:31,876 --> 00:35:34,572
Generoo: What's wrong with him?

666
00:35:36,781 --> 00:35:37,748
Mulder: Get a doctor.

667
00:35:37,816 --> 00:35:40,683
( whimpering )

668
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:47,919
Help me.

669
00:35:48,026 --> 00:35:49,186
Help me.

670
00:35:49,294 --> 00:35:51,319
How can we helpyou,
Colonel?

671
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:54,887
He's having some kind
ofa seizure, Mulder.

672
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:56,296
Come on, come on!

673
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:58,927
Belt: lt's tearing me apart!

674
00:35:59,003 --> 00:36:01,233
See ifl can get
a pulse.

675
00:36:03,007 --> 00:36:04,565
( moaning )

676
00:36:04,642 --> 00:36:06,234
Help me. Oh, help me.

677
00:36:06,311 --> 00:36:08,336
l'm bringing

678
00:36:08,413 --> 00:36:09,539
that shuttle down.

679
00:36:09,614 --> 00:36:11,673
No!

680
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:13,444
lt's out there!

681
00:36:15,653 --> 00:36:18,121
Easy, easy.

682
00:36:18,189 --> 00:36:19,622
Belt: Spacesuits!

683
00:36:19,724 --> 00:36:20,247
Give him

684
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:21,825
Diazepam.

685
00:36:21,926 --> 00:36:23,359
No.

686
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:25,554
He's going to hurt himself.

687
00:36:25,663 --> 00:36:28,791
He's trying
to tell us something.

688
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:31,028
Those men
are running out ofoxygen.

689
00:36:31,102 --> 00:36:33,502
They don't have to die.

690
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:35,129
l wantyou to focus.

691
00:36:35,206 --> 00:36:37,572
Focus your breathing.

692
00:36:37,642 --> 00:36:39,269
Focus your pain.

693
00:36:39,344 --> 00:36:40,470
Right here.

694
00:36:43,248 --> 00:36:45,045
Blood pressure 1 74 over 1 20.

695
00:36:45,116 --> 00:36:46,310
Vitals are rising.

696
00:36:46,384 --> 00:36:47,681
Mulder

697
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:49,049
you're risking
an aneurysm.

698
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,280
Focus.

699
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:54,219
Nowyou're focused.

700
00:36:54,325 --> 00:36:55,519
Right here.

701
00:36:55,627 --> 00:36:58,528
Now, you're going
to save those astronauts

702
00:36:58,596 --> 00:37:00,791
and you're going to tell me

703
00:37:00,865 --> 00:37:02,730
how to do it.

704
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,362
The shuttle
can't survive reentry.

705
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:08,200
No. He's lying.

706
00:37:08,273 --> 00:37:10,173
How doyou know

707
00:37:10,241 --> 00:37:11,640
it can't survive?

708
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:13,199
The fuselage...
The fuselage is damaged.

709
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:15,303
The silicone tiles

710
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,438
are destroyed.

711
00:37:16,514 --> 00:37:17,674
How does he know?

712
00:37:17,749 --> 00:37:19,376
How has it
been damaged?

713
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,145
l'm responsible.

714
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:22,914
Did you sabotage the shuttle?

715
00:37:22,987 --> 00:37:27,287
No, but l couldn't stop them.

716
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:29,451
Nobody can stop them.

717
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:30,755
Stop who?

718
00:37:30,862 --> 00:37:31,624
Pulse 1 94.

719
00:37:31,696 --> 00:37:32,958
You'll kill him.

720
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:33,793
Stop who?

721
00:37:33,865 --> 00:37:35,799
They don't want us to know.

722
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:37,767
They don't want us to know.

723
00:37:37,835 --> 00:37:38,460
Who?

724
00:37:38,536 --> 00:37:41,004
lt came to me.

725
00:37:41,072 --> 00:37:43,063
lt lives in me.

726
00:37:46,778 --> 00:37:48,245
It's comingatme!

727
00:37:48,313 --> 00:37:50,247
It's comingatme!

728
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:53,978
( screaming )

729
00:37:58,957 --> 00:38:00,720
And now--

730
00:38:00,825 --> 00:38:03,953
Help me!
lt's coming back!

731
00:38:14,472 --> 00:38:17,669
Generoo: That's the face
l saw in the fog.

732
00:38:17,742 --> 00:38:19,437
We're losing him.

733
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,636
Defib.

734
00:38:20,712 --> 00:38:21,940
Hereyou go.

735
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,681
Clear.

736
00:38:26,751 --> 00:38:28,082
Hit it.

737
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,785
They're out ofoxygen.

738
00:38:30,855 --> 00:38:32,254
They've got exactly

739
00:38:32,323 --> 00:38:35,019
30 minutes left
in the backup system.

740
00:38:35,126 --> 00:38:37,219
They're going to suffocate
up there.

741
00:38:37,328 --> 00:38:39,853
l've got no choice
but to bring them down.

742
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:41,864
lt's the only chance l've got.

743
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:43,958
Again.

744
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:46,494
O2 standing by...

745
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:48,732
Hold on.

746
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:50,137
We've got vitals.

747
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:53,200
Scully: We've got to get him
to a hospital.

748
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:56,278
O.T.C., this is Houston
Mission Control.

749
00:38:56,347 --> 00:38:57,780
Doyou copy?

750
00:38:57,849 --> 00:38:59,373
Roger, Houston.

751
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:02,317
We'vegotsomespookystuff
uphere.

752
00:39:02,387 --> 00:39:04,480
O.T.C., we're going
to bring you down.

753
00:39:04,555 --> 00:39:08,013
We wantyou to instigate
de-orbit burn

754
00:39:08,126 --> 00:39:10,151
and begin deceleration.

755
00:39:10,261 --> 00:39:12,491
Roger, Houston.
I washopingyou'dsay that.

756
00:39:12,563 --> 00:39:14,497
Activating
O.M.S. rockets.

757
00:39:14,565 --> 00:39:16,965
Allsystemsgo
forreentry.

758
00:39:17,035 --> 00:39:19,265
They're bringing
the shuttle down.

759
00:39:19,337 --> 00:39:22,500
You said the shuttle
would burn up on reentry.

760
00:39:22,573 --> 00:39:25,167
ls there anything
we can do to save it?

761
00:39:25,243 --> 00:39:27,507
Change the trajectory.

762
00:39:27,578 --> 00:39:29,068
Change the trajectory

763
00:39:29,147 --> 00:39:30,375
to what?

764
00:39:30,448 --> 00:39:33,611
Change the reentry trajectory

765
00:39:33,685 --> 00:39:34,879
to 35 degrees.

766
00:39:42,026 --> 00:39:43,823
We've got to change
the reentry trajectory.

767
00:39:43,895 --> 00:39:44,862
Generoo: What?

768
00:39:44,962 --> 00:39:46,691
Change it to 35 degrees.

769
00:39:46,764 --> 00:39:48,755
30 seconds
to ionosphere reentry.

770
00:39:48,866 --> 00:39:49,457
Belt...

771
00:39:49,534 --> 00:39:50,592
l can't.

772
00:39:50,668 --> 00:39:51,635
25 seconds.

773
00:39:51,703 --> 00:39:52,795
lt's your only shot.

774
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,462
We'd have to change landing site

775
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:56,131
and inform them before blackout.

776
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:57,765
1 5 seconds to blackout.

777
00:39:57,842 --> 00:39:59,810
What's the weather
in Albuquerque?

778
00:39:59,877 --> 00:40:02,402
Are we go
for an emergency landing?

779
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,345
Weather in Albuquerque?

780
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:06,474
Landing conditions go
in Albuquerque.

781
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:08,610
T-minus five seconds
to blackout.

782
00:40:08,686 --> 00:40:10,153
O.T.C., this is Houston.

783
00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:12,815
Changeyour trajectory
to 35 degrees.

784
00:40:12,924 --> 00:40:15,484
You'll be landing
in Albuquerque.

785
00:40:15,593 --> 00:40:16,753
lonosphere reentry.

786
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:18,328
They get
that transmission?

787
00:40:18,429 --> 00:40:19,896
Two minutes
to reestablish.

788
00:40:19,997 --> 00:40:21,555
Damn it.

789
00:40:26,971 --> 00:40:30,270
How much oxygen do they have?

790
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:31,137
1 6 minutes.

791
00:40:32,777 --> 00:40:35,211
O.T.C., this is Houston.

792
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:36,678
Come in, O.T.C.

793
00:40:38,116 --> 00:40:40,346
O.T.C., this is Houston.

794
00:40:40,418 --> 00:40:42,409
Come in, O.T.C.!

795
00:40:42,487 --> 00:40:44,114
Anything?

796
00:40:46,657 --> 00:40:48,716
What's the point
oftheir new reentry?

797
00:40:48,826 --> 00:40:50,225
West of Hawaii.

798
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:51,955
Hawaii's picked
the shuttle up

799
00:40:52,063 --> 00:40:53,189
on radar.

800
00:40:53,297 --> 00:40:54,787
They made it.

801
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:56,298
Not necessarily.

802
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:02,870
Albuquerque, doyou have
radar confirmation?

803
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,034
Negative, Houston.
Nothingon thescreen.

804
00:41:13,818 --> 00:41:15,410
O.T.C., this is Houston.

805
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:16,976
Come in, O.T.C.

806
00:41:18,222 --> 00:41:19,484
O.T.C., this is Houston!

807
00:41:19,557 --> 00:41:21,821
Come in, O.T.C.!

808
00:41:21,926 --> 00:41:25,828
Houston, this is O. T. C.

809
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,397
Youknowagoodplace to eat
inAlbuquerque?

810
00:41:27,498 --> 00:41:30,160
We couldmeet
fordinner.

811
00:41:34,705 --> 00:41:38,835
- Whoo!
- O.T.C., welcome home.

812
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,844
You're looking real good.

813
00:41:40,912 --> 00:41:42,072
Man: Yes!

814
00:41:54,058 --> 00:41:55,582
The Space Shuttle
touched down today

815
00:41:55,693 --> 00:41:59,595
at 1 0:56
Central Standard Time.

816
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:03,122
The orbiter delivered its payload
afterjust 1 3 orbits

817
00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:07,193
and returned to earth

818
00:42:07,271 --> 00:42:09,933
without incident.

819
00:42:10,007 --> 00:42:12,373
We at NASA are looking forward
to our next shuttle mission

820
00:42:12,443 --> 00:42:16,903
and to future successful
explorations ofspace.

821
00:42:17,048 --> 00:42:18,140
For mankind

822
00:42:18,216 --> 00:42:20,946
and for the future
ofmankind.

823
00:42:21,018 --> 00:42:22,451
( beeping )

824
00:42:52,617 --> 00:42:53,914
No...

825
00:42:53,985 --> 00:42:55,612
No more!

826
00:43:16,641 --> 00:43:18,609
( dooropens )

827
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,570
l just heard.

828
00:43:27,718 --> 00:43:29,777
Something had possessed him--

829
00:43:29,854 --> 00:43:33,517
something he must have seen
out there in space.

830
00:43:33,591 --> 00:43:35,559
The doctors who examined him

831
00:43:35,626 --> 00:43:38,493
said he was experiencing
severe dementia.

832
00:43:38,562 --> 00:43:41,292
l don't think
he ever really knew

833
00:43:41,365 --> 00:43:44,596
exactly how it was
working through him

834
00:43:44,669 --> 00:43:47,467
or that he ever knew

835
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:50,563
that he was...

836
00:43:50,675 --> 00:43:53,735
responsible
for his own actions.

837
00:43:53,844 --> 00:43:57,211
He ordered those X rays
ofthe damaged parts.

838
00:43:57,281 --> 00:43:59,715
l think he was trying
to warn her.

839
00:43:59,784 --> 00:44:02,844
l think that he sent Michelle
those X rays

840
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,947
like he was trying
to reach out to her

841
00:44:07,024 --> 00:44:09,584
without quite
knowing why

842
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,220
as ifhis own
instinctual impulse

843
00:44:12,296 --> 00:44:14,059
was to save those men.

844
00:44:14,131 --> 00:44:16,656
While simultaneously
trying to kill them?

845
00:44:16,734 --> 00:44:19,225
Scully, we send those men
up into space

846
00:44:19,303 --> 00:44:21,498
to unlock the doors
ofthe universe

847
00:44:21,605 --> 00:44:24,233
and we don't even know
what's behind them.

848
00:44:24,342 --> 00:44:27,311
l thinkwhatever it was,
he took it with him.

849
00:44:27,378 --> 00:44:28,936
And in the end,
that was

850
00:44:29,046 --> 00:44:32,015
the onlyway
he knew how to stop it.

851
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:34,984
There's an investigation,
you know.

852
00:44:35,052 --> 00:44:37,816
They haven't ruled out
foul play.

853
00:44:37,888 --> 00:44:40,686
He gave his own life.

854
00:44:43,461 --> 00:44:46,157
He was an astronaut. That was
something he was prepared to do.

855
00:44:48,933 --> 00:44:51,401
Colonel Marcus Aurelius Belt
devoted his life

856
00:44:51,469 --> 00:44:54,700
to the exploration
and understanding ofspace--

857
00:44:54,805 --> 00:44:57,433
learning its mysteries
and experiencing it

858
00:44:57,541 --> 00:45:00,840
notjust for himself
but for humanity.

859
00:45:00,911 --> 00:45:03,379
Lord, take
this man's soul

860
00:45:03,447 --> 00:45:05,642
and let it rise up
toyour heavens,

861
00:45:05,716 --> 00:45:07,775
higher than he could ever
go as a man.

862
00:45:07,852 --> 00:45:10,082
Let him know the true nature
ofthe universe

863
00:45:10,154 --> 00:45:12,122
that he sought
to learn.

864
00:46:25,796 --> 00:46:28,594
Boy: l made this.
