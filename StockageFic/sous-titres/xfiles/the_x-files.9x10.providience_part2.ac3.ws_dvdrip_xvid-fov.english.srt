At 7:00 this evening,
in a Washington D.C. Alley...

35
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:01,423
a vehicle carrying the son
of Agent Dana Scully...

36
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,092
was forced to a violent stop
by a female shooter...

37
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:07,102
who proceeded
to kidnap the child at gunpoint.

38

The van was being driven
by three men...

39
00:04:10,474 --> 00:04:14,342
asked by Agent Scully
to protect the child.

40
00:04:14,445 --> 00:04:18,711
The three men are currently
working to I.D. The assailant.

41

was seriously injured...

42
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:42,564

as he tried to halt her vehicle.

43

Agent Doggett remains in a coma
under close watch...

44
00:04:47,044 --> 00:04:49,035
at St. Mary's Hospital.

45
00:04:49,146 --> 00:04:53,082
This kidnapping follows
on the heels of a failed attack...

46
00:04:53,183 --> 00:04:55,981
on Scully's child by another
FBI agent, Robert Comer.

47
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:58,418

in critical condition...

has no reason to believe...

53

Deputy Director Kersh asked him
to take the lead.

information for Kersh.

69

once but <i>twice...</i>

74
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,333

accuse Follmer or Kersh...

isn't that right, Mr. Follmer?

540
00:40:35,524 --> 00:40:37,082
Finding nothing to support...

541
00:40:37,192 --> 00:40:39,217
that allegation.

542
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:41,386
Well, that's just it, sir.

543
00:40:43,799 --> 00:40:45,426
I did find something.

544
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:49,298
The monitors in
Agent Comer's room...

545
00:40:49,404 --> 00:40:51,929
they recorded his condition
moment by moment...

546
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,066
showing that his vital signs...

547
00:40:55,177 --> 00:40:59,671
did improve just before
his equipment was unplugged.

548
00:41:01,983 --> 00:41:03,075
They did, in fact...

549
00:41:03,185 --> 00:41:07,315
return back to normal.

550
00:41:07,422 --> 00:41:10,391
And you have an explanation
for that, yes?

551
00:41:10,492 --> 00:41:12,483
No, sir, I don't.

552
00:41:12,594 --> 00:41:15,427
And you want what?

553
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:20,097
I just want to take
my name off it.

554
00:41:20,202 --> 00:41:25,765
Maybe if you weren't so busy
backpedaling, Mr. Follmer...

555
00:41:25,874 --> 00:41:28,001
you might get me an explanation.

556
00:41:30,846 --> 00:41:32,245
Excuse me.

557
00:41:43,225 --> 00:41:46,422
I'm sure you heard all of that.

558
00:41:53,468 --> 00:41:56,130
Congratulations.
It would appear now...

559
00:41:56,238 --> 00:41:58,968
that everything is dead
but this case.

560
00:42:08,483 --> 00:42:12,249
I'm sure I can take care
of that, Deputy Director.

561
00:42:12,354 --> 00:42:14,447
Quite sure.

562
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:00,525
