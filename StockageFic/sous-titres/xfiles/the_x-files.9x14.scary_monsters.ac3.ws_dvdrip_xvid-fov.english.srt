00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:47,873
I can't say.

186
00:14:51,014 --> 00:14:54,575
Why lie to us,
if you want us to help you?

187
00:14:54,684 --> 00:14:58,245
Because there are people
working here at the FBI

188
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,515
who would kill me

189
00:14:59,623 --> 00:15:02,114
if they knew I
was being held here.

190
00:15:04,127 --> 00:15:08,530
The same people who
would kill Mulder.

191
00:15:18,475 --> 00:15:20,238
You can put
your clothes back on.

192
00:15:20,343 --> 00:15:23,005
I'm asking for your help.

193
00:15:23,113 --> 00:15:24,876
But I might be able

194
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:27,711
to help you.

195
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:31,446
How can you help me?

196
00:15:31,554 --> 00:15:35,046
You're looking for answers too.

197
00:15:35,158 --> 00:15:37,490
[Mulder]
We're both looking for answers.

198
00:15:58,948 --> 00:16:01,610
It's not him.

199
00:16:01,718 --> 00:16:03,618
It's not Mulder.

200
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,711
You're absolutely sure
of that?

201
00:16:05,822 --> 00:16:07,050
Yes.

202
00:16:07,157 --> 00:16:08,215
And so will we all be

203
00:16:08,325 --> 00:16:10,293
once you bring me back
his DNA tests.

204
00:16:12,962 --> 00:16:14,657
What do we do with him now?

205
00:16:14,764 --> 00:16:16,732
Well, admittedly he's lying
about who he is

206
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,391
but the danger to him
may be real.

207
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:19,729
I think we need
to figure out

208
00:16:19,836 --> 00:16:20,860
what it is
that he wants

209
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,767
and then see if he lies
about that too.

210
00:16:22,872 --> 00:16:25,432
How are we going to do that?

211
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:29,103
Well, first, I think we need
to quietly get him back to DC.

212
00:16:29,212 --> 00:16:30,406
To FBI headquarters.

213
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,832
You came here
looking for something.

214
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:53,368
What is it that
you hope to find?

215
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,404
I didn't find it.

216
00:16:57,107 --> 00:16:58,836
[Reyes]
You stole several files

217
00:16:58,942 --> 00:17:02,173
pertaining to the 1973
abduction of Mulder's sister.

218
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:04,473
But yet you say
there's danger

219
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:06,276
to your life right now.

220
00:17:06,383 --> 00:17:09,079
The conspiracy to keep
the truth about aliens

221
00:17:09,185 --> 00:17:10,652
from the American public

222
00:17:10,754 --> 00:17:12,722
all but destroyed
a few years ago

223
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:15,086
has given rise
to a new conspiracy

224
00:17:15,191 --> 00:17:18,957
in the government now
by men who are alien themselves.

225
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:23,962
And what does this
have to do with you?

226
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:27,093
What you can see
they did to me

227
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:30,866
was a failed attempt to turn me
into one of these alien men.

228
00:17:30,974 --> 00:17:33,568
I was a guinea pig...

229
00:17:33,676 --> 00:17:35,337
a test subject.

230
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:39,814
And now I want to expose
their evil plans.

231
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,850
What plans are those?

232
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:47,618
To do this to you...

233
00:17:49,392 --> 00:17:51,292
to everyone.

234
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:53,794
Mulder said there
were files here...

235
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:55,831
cases like mine.

236
00:17:55,932 --> 00:17:57,957
He gave me names
and case numbers

237
00:17:58,067 --> 00:17:59,364
but I don't see them.

238
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:00,527
They're not here.

239
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:05,199
Someone's already removed them.

240
00:18:05,308 --> 00:18:08,368
Yes.

241
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:10,309
Who?

242
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,557
This is what
you're looking for.

243
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:32,594
You trust me?

244
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,236
Thank you.

245
00:18:54,657 --> 00:18:56,181
What are you doing?

246
00:18:56,292 --> 00:18:58,487
Proving Agent Doggett wrong.

247
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,495
That that's not
Mulder in there.

248
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,690
How? I don't understand.

249
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,994
Mulder and I agreed
to take those files

250
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:06,466
out of the
X-Files office

251
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:08,594
and leave them here
for safekeeping.

252
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:11,071
Mulder would have known
where they were.

253
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:12,869
And that man
in there didn't.

254
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:15,945
[William Crying]

255
00:19:23,953 --> 00:19:25,784
[Crying Continues]

256
00:19:27,957 --> 00:19:29,447
What are you doing?!

257
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,186
Get away from the crib!

258
00:19:31,294 --> 00:19:32,261
He was crying...

259
00:19:32,362 --> 00:19:34,489
It's none of your business!

260
00:19:34,597 --> 00:19:36,360
I'm sorry.

261
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,764
I'd heard so much
about William.

262
00:19:38,868 --> 00:19:41,302
Mulder told me
how he missed him.

263
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:49,635
Well, if that's true,
then where the hell is he?

264
00:19:52,215 --> 00:19:53,807
Just tell me where he is!

265
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:55,009
You don't want to know.

266
00:19:55,118 --> 00:19:56,142
I have to know.

267
00:19:56,252 --> 00:19:59,050
He's in pain... terrible pain.

268
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:00,213
Then let me go to him.

269
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:01,688
There's nothing you can do.

270
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,452
That's not for you to decide.

271
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,427
You know as well as I
that's Mulder's decision.

272
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:09,464
I... He begged me
to honor it.

273
00:20:09,566 --> 00:20:11,796
For your safety...

274
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:14,893
and William's.

275
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:18,371
Here, Dana, let me
take him for you.

276
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:19,463
No.

277
00:20:19,576 --> 00:20:21,976
Please.

278
00:20:22,078 --> 00:20:24,012
May I?

279
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:28,844
I wanna hold him.

280
00:20:28,952 --> 00:20:30,749
Mr. Miller...

281
00:20:30,853 --> 00:20:32,844
No, it's important I do this.

282
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:39,122
I want to hold him for Mulder.

283
00:20:47,971 --> 00:20:49,996
[Cooing]

284
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:23,596
He's so beautiful.

285
00:21:37,954 --> 00:21:39,546
[Door Opening]

286
00:21:39,656 --> 00:21:40,623
Assistant Director.

287
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:42,452
You said you've
spoken to the lab.

288
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:43,752
I got some advance info

289
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,260
on the exam that Scully
performed on the man.

290
00:21:46,362 --> 00:21:47,590
What?

291
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:49,164
The blood type
matches Mulder's

292
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:52,200
but there are aspects of the physiology
that aren't a match.

293
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:53,529
Such as?

294
00:21:53,636 --> 00:21:55,900
Well, the body
mass, of course.

295
00:21:56,005 --> 00:21:57,870
He's shorter and weighs
considerably less

296
00:21:57,974 --> 00:21:58,906
than Mulder did.

297
00:21:59,008 --> 00:22:00,566
You haven't seen this guy...

298
00:22:00,677 --> 00:22:02,076
what they've done to him.

299
00:22:02,245 --> 00:22:04,770
The way he's twisted,
he's like an old man.

300
00:22:04,881 --> 00:22:06,815
He could be a hundred years old.

301
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,474
I'm just relaying the facts.

302
00:22:08,584 --> 00:22:09,915
And the fact is, he's not

303
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:11,213
a hundred years old, is he?

304
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,582
Not the way
he attacked you.

305
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,751
Well, whoever he is,
he wants something.

306
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:18,121
He says he wants revenge

307
00:22:18,227 --> 00:22:19,717
against the people that burned him.

308
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:21,353
And Mulder directed him
to the place

309
00:22:21,464 --> 00:22:23,989
where he could find the files
and the people who did it.

310
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,431
That doesn't make any sense.

311
00:22:25,535 --> 00:22:27,230
Mulder knows those files
inside out.

312
00:22:27,336 --> 00:22:28,462
Why would he direct him?

313
00:22:28,571 --> 00:22:29,731
Why not just tell him?

314
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:30,806
[Phone Ringing]

315
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,340
Skinner.

316
00:22:36,446 --> 00:22:38,937
Yeah.

317
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:41,073
You're sure about that?

318
00:22:42,685 --> 00:22:45,313
All right.

319
00:22:49,158 --> 00:22:50,750
What?

320
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:56,825
That was the lab.

321
00:22:56,933 --> 00:22:59,458
They were able to rush
the PCR test

322
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:01,093
and they came up with

323
00:23:01,204 --> 00:23:03,434
a definitive DNA result.

324
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:04,597
What is it?

325
00:23:07,143 --> 00:23:09,543
Where is this man right now?

326
00:23:25,094 --> 00:23:28,188
It's all been a good act.

327
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,664
I don't know what you mean.

328
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,634
I think you do.

329
00:23:42,945 --> 00:23:45,573
You knew those files were here.

330
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:47,114
You just pretended not to

331
00:23:47,216 --> 00:23:49,684
so that I'd bring you
here to see William.

332
00:23:49,786 --> 00:23:51,253
No.

333
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:52,821
I want the truth from you.

334
00:23:52,922 --> 00:23:53,946
What truth?

335
00:23:54,056 --> 00:23:55,489
The truth that you won't speak.

336
00:23:55,591 --> 00:23:57,491
I want the same
truth you do.

337
00:23:57,593 --> 00:23:59,584
Don't do this to me.
Not you.

338
00:23:59,695 --> 00:24:01,993
I didn't come here to upset you.

339
00:24:02,098 --> 00:24:04,225
I didn't plan on being caught.

340
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,893
I know you must have
a hard life

341
00:24:07,003 --> 00:24:08,163
living alone raising a son

342
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:10,068
not knowing whether
you'll see Mulder again.

343
00:24:10,173 --> 00:24:11,606
How do you know my life?

344
00:24:11,707 --> 00:24:13,732
I know what Mulder knows.

345
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:16,209
I know they used you
to create the child.

346
00:24:16,312 --> 00:24:18,041
I know they continue
to use you

347
00:24:18,147 --> 00:24:19,978
to take care
of it and raise it.

348
00:24:20,082 --> 00:24:21,743
What are you saying?

349
00:24:21,851 --> 00:24:23,546
You know what I'm saying.

350
00:24:23,653 --> 00:24:27,089
Your son... your child
is part alien.

351
00:24:28,224 --> 00:24:30,454
Just tell me who you are.

352
00:24:33,596 --> 00:24:35,723
Come on, just say your name.

353
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:39,232
Say it!

354
00:24:39,335 --> 00:24:41,667
Just say it!

355
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,295
Agent Scully...

356
00:24:43,406 --> 00:24:44,930
Could you please leave?

357
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:46,338
And close the door?

358
00:24:46,442 --> 00:24:48,740
Can you step out, please?

359
00:24:48,845 --> 00:24:50,506
This was a private
conversation.

360
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:51,841
I understand.

361
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,176
I'm sorry.

362
00:24:54,517 --> 00:24:56,212
Do you know who
that man is?

363
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:57,843
Yes, I do.

364
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,421
Agent Scully...

365
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,148
What is this?

366
00:25:02,258 --> 00:25:03,225
What?

367
00:25:03,326 --> 00:25:04,816
[Doggett]

It's not him.

He wouldn't
say these things.

371
00:25:13,202 --> 00:25:15,466

to Fox Mulder's.

It's not him.

Whoever that is is going
to know it's him.

398

I mean, that's what
he's afraid of.

399
00:28:48,484 --> 00:28:52,318
If he's so afraid,
then why did he run?

You still don't believe
it's him.

even begin to know.

a perfect match.

hard this is for him.

protect himself.

00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,130
and bought some
brand-new stuff, okay?

548
00:40:13,235 --> 00:40:14,998
Thank you.

549
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,340
I know it's impossible

550
00:40:20,442 --> 00:40:22,637
to stop thinking
about what he said

551
00:40:22,744 --> 00:40:24,302
about William...

552
00:40:24,412 --> 00:40:28,610
but it's all lies, Dana

553
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:32,312
and you were the
one who proved it.

554
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,389
And how should I prove it now?

555
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:38,982
By insisting
that I can protect him...

556
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,422
...only to learn too late
that I can't?

557
00:40:47,836 --> 00:40:50,896
You say it as if
you have a choice.

558
00:40:51,006 --> 00:40:56,069
He didn't have a choice
to come into this life.

559
00:40:56,178 --> 00:40:58,669
I don't have a choice

560
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,340
about what he is or was...

561
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:06,880
...but I do have a choice

562
00:41:06,988 --> 00:41:09,889
about the life
my son will have...

563
00:41:12,294 --> 00:41:15,092
[Voice Breaking]
...and shouldn't I choose

564
00:41:15,197 --> 00:41:18,598
that he never have to be afraid
of anyone or anything?

565
00:41:22,304 --> 00:41:23,601
And can I ever really

566
00:41:23,705 --> 00:41:25,605
even promise him that?

567
00:41:30,345 --> 00:41:32,245
But who can?

568
00:41:40,155 --> 00:41:45,388
- [Crying]
- ? Hallelujah...?

569
00:41:45,493 --> 00:41:50,726
? Chills the body
but not the soul?

570
00:41:50,832 --> 00:41:56,236
? Hallelujah?

571
00:41:56,338 --> 00:42:01,571
? Michael, row the boat ashore?

572
00:42:01,676 --> 00:42:07,080
? Hallelujah?

573
00:42:07,182 --> 00:42:12,176
? Michael, row the boat ashore?

574
00:42:12,287 --> 00:42:17,691
- [Singing]
- ? Hallelujah?

575
00:42:17,792 --> 00:42:22,855
- ? Sister, help to trim the sail?
...in there.

576
00:42:22,964 --> 00:42:26,991
- ? Hallelujah?
- Look what I got. Big buffalo.

577
00:42:27,102 --> 00:42:28,262
[Laughing]

578
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:33,467
? Sister, help
to trim the sail?

579
00:42:33,575 --> 00:42:39,207
? Hallelujah?

580
00:42:39,314 --> 00:42:44,377
? Michael, row the boat ashore?

581
00:42:44,486 --> 00:42:49,389
? Hallelujah?

582
00:42:49,491 --> 00:42:55,054
- Sweet dreams, baby boy.
- ? Michael, row the boat ashore?

583
00:42:55,163 --> 00:43:00,624
? Hallelujah?

584
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:05,672
? Jordan River
is deep and wide?

585
00:43:05,774 --> 00:43:10,802
? Hallelujah?

586
00:43:10,912 --> 00:43:22,050
? Milk and honey
on the other side, hallelujah.?

587
00:44:00,495 --> 00:44:02,087
