- This is Dr Saul Grissom.

- There's a fire outside my apartment.
- <i>Are you at 700 East 56th Street?</i>

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,551
- Yes, apartment 606. For God's sakes, hurry!
- <i>Fire units are being dispatched.</i>

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,754

Keep right. Please keep moving, sir.

17
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,791
I don't see any smoke anywhere.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,718
Get a crew up to the roof!

19
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,157
This is Lieutenant Regan. We have
a possible 2-3 false alarm in apartment 606.

20
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,959
Let's confirm that location. 606.

21
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,873
<i>(dispatcher) Yes, that's affirmative. 606.</i>

22
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,351
It's cold. Let's do it!

23
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,791
<i>(fireman)</i> I'll take the bedroom.

24
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,951
<i>(Regan)</i> He looks dead.

25
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,398
<i>(fireman)</i> Nothing here.

26
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,308
- <i>911 operator. Police emergency.</i>
- <i>This is Dr Saul Grissom.</i>

27
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,949
- <i>There's a fire outside my apartment.</i>
- <i>Are you at 700 East 56th Street?</i>

28
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,079
- <i>Yes, apartment 606. For God's sakes, hurry!</i>
- <i>Fire units are being dispatched.</i>

29
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,593
<i>Please stay on the line.</i>

30
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,995
The article makes no mention of a fire.

31
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,230
Yes, Agent Mulder, I can read.

32
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,709
Grissom's company
had government contracts,

33
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,429
so this investigation
would be within the Bureau's jurisdiction.

34
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,833
But that's not why
you want the assignment.

35
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,629
I think that the circumstances surrounding
Grissom's death warrant a closer look.

36
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,158
NYPD won't even talk to me unless you
get the Attorney General to sign off on it.

37
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,595
Where did you get the tape?

38
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,630
Presumably someone has led you to believe
there's more here than is being reported.

39
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,915
My source, the only one
I've ever trusted, is dead.

40
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,795
I'll look into this further
and, uh... let you know.

41
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:22,508
In the meantime, you have 24 hours
of wiretap tape to transcribe.

42
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,830
<i>(woman on tape) You comin' over or what?</i>

43
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,150
<i>You said you was comin'</i>
<i>over two hours ago.</i>

44
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,994
<i>I'm waitin'here like some bimbo</i>
<i>who ain't got nothin'better to do...</i>

45
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,949
<i>... waitin' here like some bimbo</i>
<i>who ain't got nothin'better to do...</i>

46
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,031
<i>... than just sit around and wait for you.</i>

47
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,111
Agent Mulder?

48
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,317
- Yeah?
- It's your 302.

49
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,312
Assistant Director Skinner
just approved it.

50
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,870
There's a mistake.
Another agent has been assigned to the case.

51
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,110
That would be me.

52
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,276
Krycek. Alex Krycek.

53
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,477
- Skinner didn't mention taking on a partner.
- It wasn't Skinner.

54
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,599
I opened the file two hours before
your request, so technically it's my case.

55
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,870
- You already talked to the police?
- Yep.

56
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,316
Just hung up on the officer in charge
a few minutes ago.

57
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,156
A detective named... Horton.

58
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,876
- Seems Grissom called 911 to report a fire.
- I heard the tape.

59
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,114
Did you hear that Forensics found
a spent fire-extinguisher on the floor?

60
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,350
Grissom's prints were all over it.

61
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,956
The walls and floor in his living room
were covered with ammonium phosphate.

62
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,838
- But no trace of fire?
- Not even a burnt match.

63
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,799
- Is that all you know?
- Yeah. So far.

64
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,357
- What do you think it means?
- I appreciate the show and tell...

65
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,876
...and I don't want you to take this
personally, but I work alone.

66
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,750
- I'll straighten things out with Skinner.
- It's my case, Agent Mulder.

67
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,068
Look, I may be... green...

68
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,189
...but I had the case first
and I'm not gonna give it away so quickly.

69
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,796
I'll tell you what.
I got some work to finish up around here.

70
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,795
Why don't you go to the motor pool and
requisition us a car? I'll meet you there.

71
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,077
That's all? You don't have a problem
with us working together?

72
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,390
Hey, it's your party.

73
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,393
I'II, um... I'll get the car.

74
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,477
Electrocution affects
electrolytic conduction...

75
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,075
...disrupting the heartbeat
and most of the autonomic systems.

76
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,551
Death actually occurs from tissue damage,
necrosis in the heart itself...

77
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,315
...particularly in the sinus
and atrioventricular nodes.

78
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,631
Agent Scully. Sorry to interrupt.
You have a call from a George Hale.

79
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,917
- Says it's urgent.
- Excuse me.

80
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,631
- Where are you?
- <i>National Airport.</i>

81
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,711
Catching the shuttle to LaGuardia.

82
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,394
Wanna join me in the Big Apple
for an autopsy?

83
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,234
- What's going on?
- <i>I was hoping you could tell me.</i>

84
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,993
I can't today.
My last class isn't over until 4.30.

85
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,999
That's fine.
I can have the ME wrap the body to go.

86
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,640
- <i>Mulder...</i>
- You'll get it by five.

87
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,199
What's the name?

88
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,712
Doctor Grissom's alpha wave analysis
defined the standard.

89
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,234
He revolutionised the way
we think about sleep.

90
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,834
His death is a tremendous loss to science.

91
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,714
How many other kinds
of sleep disorder did he treat?

92
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,917
There are 38 different
dyssomnias and parasomnias.

93
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,549
Doctor Grissom treated them all
with an unprecedented success ratio.

94
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,110
Maintaining that kind of batting average
must have taken its toll.

95
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,475
Excellence demands certain sacrifices.

96
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,597
- Did he show signs of psychological stress?
- Not really.

97
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,433
Except for his own occasional
bout of insomnia.

98
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,114
- But he was never delusional?
- Of course not.

99
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,113
- What's <i>his</i> story?
- This patient's night terrors...

100
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,318
...prevent him from cycling out of REM sleep
into the more restful slow-wave sleep.

101
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,315
It's still experimental, but we're trying
to modify his brain wave patterns externally.

102
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,075
- How do you do that?
- Electrical stimulation of the occipital lobe...

103
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,833
...creates visual and auditory hallucinations.

104
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,312
- It's possible to alter somebody's dreams?
- In theory, yes.

105
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,195
<i>(car door shuts)</i>

106
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,391
I paid off your cab.

107
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,996
- I don't like being ditched like a bad date.
- Sorry if I hurt your feelings.

108
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,516
What's with this attitude?
You don't know the first thing about me.

109
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,079
Exactly.

110
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,948
You know, back at the academy...
some of the guys used to make fun of you.

111
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,477
- Stop it or you're gonna hurt <i>my</i> feelings.
- But some of us followed your work.

112
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,348
Because we knew there was more
out there than they were telling us.

113
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,431
<i>(phone rings)</i>

114
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,912
- Yeah.
- Dr Grissom didn't die from cardiac arrest.

115
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,359
- What is it?
- I think you should take a look for yourself.

116
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,719
I haven't even started on the chest and the
abdomen and I'll have more to tell you then.

117
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,791
I can make it in two hours.

118
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,231
Where are we going?

119
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,314
- Spleen or pancreas?
- Stomach.

120
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,391
I was just about to start on it.

121
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,115
Oh, uh... this is Alex Krycek.
We're working the case together.

122
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,350
- Good to meet you.
- You too.

123
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,673
Notice the pugilistic attitude of the corpse.

124
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,751
<i>(Krycek splutters)</i>

125
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,670
This condition generally occurs
several hours after death.

126
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,399
It's caused by
a coagulation of muscle proteins...

127
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,631
...when the body is exposed
to extremely high temperatures.

128
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,712
- Like fire?
- This degree of limb flexion...

129
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,236
...is observed exclusively
in burn-related victims.

130
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,950
- There was no fire.
- And no epidermal burns to indicate that.

131
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,794
But when I opened up the skull,
I found extradural haemorrhages...

132
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,519
...which can only be caused by intense heat.

133
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,319
Somehow this man suffered
all of the secondary...

134
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,871
...but none of the primary physiological
responses to having been in a fire.

135
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,996
Any theories?

136
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,995
I can't even begin to explain what could
have caused it. I mean, it's almost as if...

137
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,071
What?

138
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,998
As if his body believed
that it was burning.

139
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,953

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,550
Ah, what's the difference?

163
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,549
We're all going to hell, right?

164
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,916
Where you think we've been
the last 24 years?

165
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,879
But after this,
wherever he sends us is gonna seem like...

166
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,951
Like a Hawaiian vacation.

167
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,591
What do you want here, Preacher?

168
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,476
You killed him, didn't you?

169
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,075
You killed Grissom. I saw it on TV.

170
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,074
He had to pay, Henry.

171
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,596
All of us have to answer
for what we did over there.

172
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,388
We can't get away from it.

173
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,629
No.

174
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,389
"He retains not his anger for ever,
because he delights in mercy."

175
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,473
"He will turn again;
he will have compassion on us."

176
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,310
"He will subdue our iniquities," Henry...

177
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,109
..."and he will cast all our sins
into the depths of the sea."

178
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,360
It's all right, Henry.

179
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,596
It's all over now.

180
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,710
The victim was Henry Willig.
Unemployed, lived on disability.

181
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,314
No indication of forced entry or struggle.

182
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,676
No abrasions or contusions
or trace evidence in the body.

183
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,389
Cause of death is being listed as...
burst aneurysm.

184
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,871
- Why did your friend from Homicide call us?
- Because a medical examiner called <i>him.</i>

185
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,714
The autopsy revealed 43 internal
haemorrhages and skeletal fragments...

186
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,870
...which doesn't happen spontaneously.

187
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,358
- Not without corresponding external trauma.
- What does the ME have to say about it?

188
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,560
He said if he didn't know otherwise,
he'd swear they were gunshot wounds.

189
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,435
What's this scar right here?

190
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,876
His records say the only surgery
he had was an appendectomy.

191
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,793
Unless they got to his appendix
through his neck.

192
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,555
Maybe it happened in Vietnam.
Willig did a tour with the marines in 1970.

193
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,474
- I'm sure they didn't keep the best of records.
- Willig was a marine?

194
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,155
So where do marines receive
basic training on the East Coast?

195
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,071
Parris Island?

196
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,472
Where Grissom was stationed
from 1968 to 1971.

197
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,836
Which means that he and Willig
were there at the same time. 24 years ago.

198
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,630
There we go. Willig was assigned
to Special Force and Recon Squad J-7.

199
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,632
Of 13 original members,
he's one of two survivors.

200
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,870
Till yesterday.

201
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,795
Which leaves us with one person who can
tell us what happened at Parris Island.

202
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,878
<i>I've been supervising Mr Cole's treatment</i>
<i>since I admitted him 12 years ago.</i>

203
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,997
I'm afraid you won't find him
very cooperative, though.

204
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,550
We just want to ask him
a few questions about his military service.

205
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,996
He doesn't respond very well to...
authority figures.

206
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,551
Is that why you put him in isolation?

207
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,029
We've had to house Mr Cole in this section...

208
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,556
...because he was interfering with
our treatment of other patients.

209
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,838
- How was he interfering?
- He was disrupting their sleep patterns.

210
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,833
With psychiatric patients,
the circadian cycles must be maintained.

211
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,879
Excuse me, but exactly how
would Cole disrupt their sleep?

212
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,392
Here we are.

213
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,552
Mr Cole!
There are some gentlemen here who...

214
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,313
- You discharged him two days ago.
- I certainly did not.

215
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,311
Don't you think I'd remember if I did?

216
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,951
I was on shift, and you signed the order
yourself. That is your signature, isn't it?

217
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,796
- <i>(phone rings)</i>
- Let's get Cole's face out on the wire.

218
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,632
- Mulder.
- <i>(man) Mr Mulder.</i>

219
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,837
<i>I've obtained information</i>
<i>that might assist your work.</i>

220
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,718
<i>But you must exercise discretion</i>
<i>when we meet.</i>

221
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,553
<i>If anyone follows you, I won't be there.</i>

222
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,230
- Who are you?
- Who I am is irrelevant.

223
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,120
- Why are you trying to help me?
- You think I want to be here, Agent Mulder?

224
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,680
- Why are you trying to help me?
- You think I want to be here, Agent Mulder?

225
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,352
I don't want to be here.

226
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,635
- What is this?
- Data from a top-secret military project...

227
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,599
...born of the idea that sleep
is the soldier's greatest enemy.

228
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,353
Grissom was conducting sleep-deprivation
experiments on Parris Island.

229
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,512
Not deprivation. Eradication.

230
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,316
- Why?
- Why else? To build a better soldier.

231
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,029
Sustained wakefulness dulls fear,
heightens aggression.

232
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,158
Science had just put a man on the moon...

233
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,550
...so they looked to science
to win a losing war.

234
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,311
And Willig and Cole were the lab rats?

235
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,995
Lab rats with the highest
kill-ratio in the Marine Corps.

236
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,471
4,000-plus confirmed kills
for a 13-man squad.

237
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,710
Is Cole behind what's happening now?

238
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,951
I'm not here to do your thinking,
Agent Mulder.

239
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,431
All I know is Augustus Cole
hasn't slept in 24 years.

240
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,550
There's someone else you should see.

241
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,518
Another squad member
reportedly killed in action.

242
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,555
- I thought Cole was the last.
- His name is on the envelope.

243
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,876
- How do I contact you?
- You can't.

244
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,316
- I may need more.
- You still don't get it, do you?

245
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,951
Closing the X-Files, separating
you and Scully, was only the beginning.

246
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,070
The truth is still out there...

247
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,755
...but it's never been more dangerous.

248
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,272
The man we both knew...
paid for that information with his life.

249
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,199
A sacrifice I'm not willing to make.

250
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,515
Where were you?

251
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,355
Someone matching Cole's description just
robbed a drugstore. He's in a nearby motel.

252
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,079
- Is he alive?
- He was when the night manager saw him.

253
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,476
So where were you?

254
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,675
Detective Horton?

255
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,955
I'm Agent Krycek. This is Agent Mulder.

256
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,670
I've been waiting for you. I tried holding the
SWAT guys back, but they're getting antsy.

257
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,070
Cole didn't steal dime one
from that drugstore. Just some pills.

258
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,991
- Freeze!
- <i>(gunshots)</i>

259
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,071
<i>(woman screams)</i>

260
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,191
- Inside! Now!
- <i>(child cries)</i>

261
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,431
Officer down!

262
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,357
We got two officers down. Both critical.
Request emergency vehicles immediately.

263
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,591
<i>(dispatcher) Roger, I copy</i>
<i>on your officers being down...</i>

264
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,391
What's going on here, Mulder?

265
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,632
These two officers. They shot each other.

266
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,790
<i>Also described in the report is</i>
<i>an experimental neurosurgical procedure...</i>

267
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,111
<i>... designed to induce</i>
<i>a permanent waking state.</i>

268
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,398
<i>The procedure involved cutting part of</i>
<i>the brain stem in the midpontile region...</i>

269
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,074
<i>... which would explain Henry Willig's scar.</i>

270
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,269
<i>A similar scar should also</i>
<i>be evident on Augustus Cole.</i>

271
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,636
<i>Postop treatment included</i>
<i>a regimen of synthetic supplements...</i>

272
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,633
<i>... to replenish the organic deficits</i>
<i>caused by prolonged lack of sleep.</i>

273
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,236
<i>This is consistent with the antidepressants</i>
<i>Cole robbed from the pharmacy.</i>

274
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,392
<i>These drugs maintain</i>
<i>serotonin levels in the blood...</i>

275
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,110
<i>... serotonin being the primary substance</i>
<i>produced during sleep.</i>

276
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,558
<i>It is theoretically possible that this procedure</i>
<i>diminished the subjects'need for sleep...</i>

277
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,952
<i>... but I can neither quantify nor substantiate</i>
<i>its success without further evidence.</i>

278
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,553
<i>(phone rings)</i>

279
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,359
- Scully.
- The second officer is still in a coma...

280
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,318
...so I don't think we can count on him
to tell us what happened.

281
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,475
I'm going over these reports you faxed me.
They're incredible.

282
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,998
The military already sent troops through
radioactive clouds. They had to top that.

283
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,595
Sleep eradication doesn't explain
the shooting of those officers.

284
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,877
Or the anomalous autopsy results
on Willig and Dr Grissom.

285
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,396
I learnt at Grissom's clinic
what happens to a person's cortex...

286
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,710
...when you stimulate it with electricity.

287
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,396
They have visual and auditory hallucinations.
Any med student can tell you that.

288
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,990
What if that stimulus
were to come from a remote source?

289
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,914
What if Cole has developed the ability
to project his unconscious?

290
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,995
Are you suggesting Cole killed
those people with telepathic images?

291
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,834
Think about it, Scully.
In all those years without REM sleep...

292
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,914
...maybe Cole bridged the waking world and
the dream world - the collective unconscious.

293
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,516
And what if, by existing consciously
in the unconscious world...

294
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,230
...he's developed the ability to externalise
his dreams and effectively alter reality?

295
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,869
Even if you're right, you'll have
a better chance of finding Cole...

296
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,475
...if you work up a profile
and try and surmise his next move.

297
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,275
All right. I'll sharpen my pencils
and I'll see you later.

298
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,351
I'll be right there, Krycek.

299
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,031
- Where are you going?
- To check on another member of the squad.

300
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,159
- See if he can tell us something.
- Sounds like your new partner's working out.

301
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,076
He's all right. He could use
a little seasoning and wardrobe advice.

302
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,277
- He's more open to extreme possibilities...
- Than I was?

303
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,628
Than I assumed he would be.

304
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,790
Must be nice not having someone
questioning your every move...

305
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,996
...poking holes in all your theories.

306
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,071
Oh... Oh yeah. It... It's great.

307
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,720
I'm surprised I put up with you for so long.

308
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,310
You'd better go.

309
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,552
I'll read over this report again
and see what else I can come up with.

310
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,629
OK.

311
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,951
<i>(country music on radio)</i>

312
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,591
Clear this up.

313
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,190
Salvatore Matola?

314
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,554
Are you here to shoot me?
You gonna kill me?

315
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,393
No. We're with the FBI.

316
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,948
We just wanted to ask you some questions.

317
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,834
Why did you think we were here to kill you?

318
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,833
- I dunno.
- You know about Willig and Grissom, huh?

319
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,430
I read about it in the paper.
Figured they were finally killing us all off.

320
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,871
Who?

321
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,349
Hey, Sal, can you spare a few minutes?

322
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,114
Yeah, I guess so. I got a break coming up.

323
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,713
Spare a few minutes. I guess.

324
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,394
They said it'd be like living two lifetimes.

325
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,029
And that... At first, that's what it was like.

326
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,471
Not having to sleep an' all...

327
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,550
...made us feel like
nothing could touch us, you know?

328
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,039
Uh...

329
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,634
We'd do 24-hour patrols...

330
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,349
...night ambushes, you know?
That type of thing.

331
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,752
- And you never got tired?
- No. Not so that we had to sleep.

332
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,759
And then, nothing that the pills couldn't fix.

333
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,832
- Serotonin?
- Yeah.

334
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,875
How long did this go on?

335
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,117
Quite a while, I'd say.

336
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:49,831
Quite a while. Until we stopped taking orders
from Company Commander in Saigon.

337
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,549
The entire squadron went AWOL?

338
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,509
Yeah. Something like that.

339
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,230
- Well, then who did you take orders from?
- We didn't.

340
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,198
We just made up missions as we went along.

341
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,112
Till it didn't matter any more
who we were killing.

342
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,436
Farmers... women.

343
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,390
Outside of Phu Bai there was this...

344
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,911
...school, and, uh...

345
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,511
They were just kids.

346
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,634
No one ever tried to stop you?

347
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,310
No, sir.

348
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,432
Police suspect Augustus Cole may be
behind the murders of Willig and Grissom.

349
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,556
You mean Preacher?

350
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,519
That's what we used to call him -
he was always reading from his Bible.

351
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,036
You know, saying this and that
about Judgment Day.

352
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,079
Saying that one day we were gonna
have to pay for what we were doing.

353
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,510
That's... that's what he said back then.
That's what he'd say.

354
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,196
But why Grissom? He was never in-country.
He wasn't even part of the squadron.

355
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,871
Sure he was.

356
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,711
He made us what we are.

357
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,118
- Him and Dr Girardi.
- Who's Dr Girardi?

358
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,439
The other doc on the project.
The one who did the surgeries on us.

359
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,749
It's because of him that...

360
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,549
...I haven't slept a night in 24 years.

361
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,515
<i>(Krycek)</i> I'm still not clear why
you think Cole will go after Girardi.

362
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,795
Cole sees himself as an avenging angel.

363
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,997
He thinks everyone
responsible for the atrocities...

364
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,640
...directly or indirectly, must be punished.

365
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,871
Yeah, but why now?
Why after all these years?

366
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,515
Phu Bai was one of the bloodiest massacres
of the war. Over 300 children slaughtered.

367
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,910
And unlike My Lai,
no US troops were ever charged.

368
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,072
The 24th anniversary of the massacre
was two days ago.

369
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,151
<i>(phone rings)</i>

370
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,752
- Mulder.
- I think I've found Francis Girardi.

371
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,195
He's a professor of neurosurgery at Harvard.

372
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,512
- Do you have his number in Boston?
- Yes. But he's coming to Grissom's funeral.

373
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,639
- When?
- Tonight. He arrives at Bronx station at 7.30.

374
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,788
Get a photograph to the security desk
so we know who we're looking for.

375
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,359
Got it.

376
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,999
- Mulder, FBI. You got a photo for me?
- Right here.

377
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,149
Stay here. I'll cover the other side.

378
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,391
Federal agent! Drop your weapon!

379
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,790
Drop it!

380
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,116
Mulder.

381
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,198
You all right?

382
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,748
Girardi! Where is he?

383
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,751
Girardi's not here.

384
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,831
I saw him. He was...

385
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,079
Mulder!

386
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,711
You were shouting and waving your gun
around, but Girardi never showed.

387
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,076
No, Girardi was here. So was Cole.
We just missed them.

388
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,878
Mulder, if they'd been here,
I would have seen them.

389
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,713
I'm telling you, Mulder. They weren't here.

390
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,918
<i>(Mulder)</i> OK, there's nothing here
so let's rewind the tape.

391
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,039
Start with a small window of time -
say, 1935 to 1945.

392
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:50,193
If you don't find anything within that
time frame, open it up one minute at a time.

393
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,317
With all these cameras,
we should be able to see something.

394
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,391
Can we talk for a second?

395
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,391
What's the problem?

396
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,756
You still haven't answered
my question about what happened.

397
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,630
- I told you, I thought I saw Girardi.
- Come on. You just about killed someone!

398
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,319
And we both know I'm covering for you
by keeping it between us.

399
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,676
- All right, what do you want to know?
- Just the truth.

400
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:22,077
- There's things that I need to know.
- My ideas are usually not very popular.

401
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,516
I told you, I wanna believe.
But I need a place to start.

402
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,953
I think Cole possesses the psychic ability
to manipulate sounds and images...

403
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,635
...to generate illusions that
are so convincing they can kill.

404
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,950
How's that for a theory?

405
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,238
Puts a whole new spin on virtual reality,
but at least it begins to explain some things.

406
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,551
Agent Mulder?

407
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,957
- See this car in the upper-right corner?
- Yeah.

408
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,398
It wasn't there five minutes ago.

409
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,309
- Where is this?
- That's track 17.

410
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,391
It's a restricted part of the yard.

411
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,230
<i>(Girardi)</i> What are you doing?

412
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,311
This is insane!

413
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,951
You can't do this to me.

414
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,560
You can't hold me responsible.

415
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,757
I was following orders. Just like you.

416
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,071
The Lord hates the lying tongue.

417
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,151
It's the truth.

418
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,552
The truth is what you did to us.
What you made us do.

419
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,116
No one made you do anything.
You volunteered.

420
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,231

Who is it? I can't see without my glasses.

427
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,037

No, man, you don't know.

- One minute is all I'm asking.

One minute's more than I care to give.

The blood's boiling in my veins.

I can feel the air stinging on my skin.

456
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,513
What the military did to you was wrong.
But maybe your testimony can help.

457
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,591
They cut out a piece of my brain.

458
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,351
They made me into somebody else.

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,992
And I can never get back
what they took away from me.

460

He had a gun. He was gonna shoot you.

467
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,471
You did the right thing.

468
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,032
<i>(Scully)</i> They broke into my office.
Went through my files, my computer.

00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,715
I came down as soon as Security called,
but the report was already gone.

470
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,634
Someone went to a lot of trouble
stealing our copies to keep this a secret.

471
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,714
Without that report as evidence, Skinner's
not gonna authorise an investigation.

472
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,514
He said it's never been more dangerous.

473
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,669
Skinner?

474
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,389
That man who leaked us the report.
The one who's been helping us.

475
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,277
You actually met with him?

476
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,318
He said closing down the X-Files
is just the beginning.

477
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,914
That we've never been in greater danger.

478
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,751
Do you trust him?

479
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,154
- Do you know where he got this?
- Not yet.

480
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,319
But he got it. Which means
he's either found another source...

481
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,510
...or another source has found him.

00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,270
Sir, if I can recommend something?

483
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,549
You'll see that I've outlined
several countermeasures.

484
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,311
- What about Scully?
- Reassigning them to other sections...

485
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,790
...seems only to have
strengthened their determination.

486
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,951
Scully's a problem.

487
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,228
A much larger problem than you described.

488
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,151
