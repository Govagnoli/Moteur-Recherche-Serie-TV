00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:25,308
It could very well have affected
her center of speech, her language.

174
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:28,387
But you can't explain it exactly.

175
00:13:28,488 --> 00:13:31,423
Nor can it be explained how the wounded
were miraculously healed...

176
00:13:31,491 --> 00:13:33,755
or how the man who healed them
vanished into thin air.

- I wanna go back to D.C.

- To do what ?
- Find out who this miracle man is.

- Y-Yeah.

somebody else in his place...

up to speed, Agent Mulder.

- Did you take these ?
- They had quite an argument,
as you might gather.

You seem surprised. Surely you
were aware they knew each other.

No, she collapsed

If I hadn't been here to make the call,
she might not have survived.

What did they argue about?

I don't know. I was forced
to keep a discreet distance.

The day my parents divorced,

Mm-hmm.

From the moment I stepped from the crowd
and asked the man to put down his gun,

231
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:56,207
it seemed like...

a man's conscience...
