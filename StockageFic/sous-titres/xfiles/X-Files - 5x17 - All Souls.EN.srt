1
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:30,530
- GOOD EVENING, FATHER.
- IS SHE READY ?

2
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,966
YES.

3
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:42,992
BAPTISM IS
THE RITE OF INITIATION.

4
00:00:44,994 --> 00:00:47,997
THIS HOLY WATER
TAKES AWAY ORIGINAL SIN.

5
00:00:49,499 --> 00:00:54,003
THE SACRAMENT
CONFERS THE GRACE OF GOD,

6
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:57,507
BRINGING THE SOUL
INTO GOD'S FAMILY.

7
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:09,335
DARA, I BAPTIZE YOU
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER...

8
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:12,622
AND OF THE SON...

9
00:01:12,622 --> 00:01:16,726
AND OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.

10
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:19,796
BLESS YOU, MY CHILD.

11
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:24,501
[ Thunderclap ]

12
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:28,321
[ Clock Chiming ]

13
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:36,546
[ Thunder Rumbling ]

14
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:20,356
DARA ?

15
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,343
OH, MY GOD.

16
00:02:54,824 --> 00:02:57,277
DARA !

17
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:01,097
DARA !

18
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,250
DARA !

19
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,278
DARA !

20
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:18,448
DARA ?

21
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,540
OH, MY GOD.

22
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:36,149
DARA !

23
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:40,703
NO !

24
00:04:52,374 --> 00:04:54,893
BLESS ME, FATHER,
FOR I HAVE SINNED.

25
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:59,197
IT HAS BEEN SEVERAL MONTHS
SINCE MY LAST CONFESSION.

26
00:04:59,197 --> 00:05:02,034
YOU HAVE A SIN
TO CONFESS ?

27
00:05:05,537 --> 00:05:08,040
FATHER,
I'M AN F.B.I. AGENT.

28
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:14,046
I'VE TAKEN IT
AS MY CODE AND PURPOSE
TO UPHOLD THE LAW.

29
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:18,533
TO SAVE LIVES.

30
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:22,037
AND NOW YOUR WORK
HAS COME IN CONFLICT
WITH YOUR FAITH.

31
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:25,490
IN A WAY.

32
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,493
I WAS HERE FOR
EASTER SERVICES LAST WEEK,

33
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:31,496
AND FATHER McCUE
APPROACHED ME FOR MY HELP.

34
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:35,500
WHY DID HE
COME TO YOU ?

35
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,337
BECAUSE THERE WAS
A FAMILY THAT HE FELT
NEEDED MY HELP.

36
00:05:39,337 --> 00:05:42,307
BUT IT WAS MORE THAN THAT.

37
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:50,248
FATHER, I HAD A DAUGHTER
WHO DIED...

38
00:05:50,248 --> 00:05:55,053
A STRANGE AND SUDDEN DEATH
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO.

39
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:57,989
FATHER McCUE THOUGHT THAT
BY HELPING THESE PEOPLE...

40
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,992
YOU MIGHT IN SOME WAY
HELP YOURSELF...

41
00:06:00,992 --> 00:06:03,245
TO COME TO TERMS
WITH YOUR GRIEF.

42
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:06,882
- YES.
- BUT YOU HAVEN'T.

43
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:14,306
FATHER, I TOLD YOU THAT
I HAD A SIN TO CONFESS.

44
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:20,312
BUT THE SIN OF WHICH I'M GUILTY,
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU CAN
OFFER FORGIVENESS.

45
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:22,798
WHAT IS THE SIN ?

46
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:29,221
AN INNOCENT GIRL IS DEAD
BECAUSE OF ME.

47
00:06:31,573 --> 00:06:36,895
I COULD'VE SAVED HER LIFE,
BUT I LET HER DIE.

48
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:46,171
[ Woman ]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

49
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:48,173
NICE TO SEE YOU.
HAPPY EASTER, FATHER.

50
00:06:48,173 --> 00:06:50,175
YES, FATHER.
HAPPY EASTER TO YOU.

51
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:53,044
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
WONDERFUL SERMON.

52
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:02,854
DANA, DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT ?

53
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:05,173
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH YOU
IN PRIVATE.

54
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:11,680
I MUST SAY, DANA,
IT'S BEEN NICE SEEING YOU
AT MASS AGAIN.

55
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,682
I'VE ALMOST STARTED
GETTING USED TO IT.

56
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:17,652
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO MAKE AN EFFORT
TO COME MORE OFTEN.

57
00:07:17,652 --> 00:07:19,955
I DON'T MEAN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF YOUR ATTENDANCE,

58
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:22,340
BUT I'VE BECOME INVOLVED
IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION...

59
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:24,843
WITH A COUPLE THAT ARE
ALSO MEMBERS HERE.

60
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:27,579
- DO YOU KNOW THE KERNOFS ?
- NO, I'M AFRAID I DON'T.

61
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:29,915
RECENTLY, THEY LOST
THEIR DAUGHTER, DARA.

62
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:34,886
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD
ABOUT THE SITUATION.
NO, I DIDN'T.

63
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:38,056
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF
 THE GIRL'S DEATH WERE SUDDEN,

64
00:07:38,056 --> 00:07:40,559
AND I'M AFRAID THE POLICE
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO TELL THEM MUCH.

65
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,246
ARE YOU ASKING
FOR MY HELP ?

66
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:48,016
THE KERNOFS ARE DEVOUT,
BUT THEIR FAITH IS GIVING THEM
LITTLE COMFORT.

67
00:07:48,016 --> 00:07:50,018
I THOUGHT WITH YOUR BACKGROUND,

68
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:52,821
YOUR WORDS MIGHT CARRY
A CERTAIN WEIGHT.

69
00:07:55,073 --> 00:07:57,959
CAN I TELL THEM
YOU'LL BE VISITING ?

70
00:08:02,547 --> 00:08:04,349
[ Mrs. Kernof ]
THAT'S DARA
ON HER 16th BIRTHDAY.

71
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:07,485
WE COULDN'T HAVE
CHILDREN OF OUR OWN.

72
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:10,939
I PERSUADED LANCE
SIX YEARS AGO TO ADOPT.

73
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:13,441
AT FIRST HE WAS
RELUCTANT TO ACCEPT
A SPECIAL-NEEDS CHILD,

74
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:15,277
BUT HE BECAME
SO ATTACHED TO HER.

75
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:19,164
THEN, THIS HAPPENS.

76
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:22,951
YOU MAKE THE CHOICE
NEVER IMAGINING
SOMETHING LIKE THIS...

77
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:25,453
OR HOW VULNERABLE
YOU ARE.

78
00:08:25,453 --> 00:08:27,956
DARA HAD JUST BEEN
BAPTIZED.

79
00:08:27,956 --> 00:08:31,710
I KNOW IN MY HEART SHE'S
GONE TO A BETTER PLACE,
BUT LANCE IS ANGRY.

80
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:36,765
ANGRY AT GOD.
THEY SAY TIME HEALS.

81
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:42,721
UM, FATHER McCUE SAID THAT
YOU'VE BEEN HAVING TROUBLE...

82
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:45,974
GETTING MUCH INFORMATION
ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAVE
HAPPENED TO HER.

83
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:48,243
THEY SAY NOW
SHE MAY HAVE BEEN
STRUCK BY LIGHTNING,

84
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:50,245
BUT NO ONE SEEMS
TO KNOW FOR SURE.

85
00:08:50,745 --> 00:08:53,248
HOW SHE EVEN GOT
OUT OF THE HOUSE ONTO
THE STREET IS A MYSTERY.

86
00:08:53,248 --> 00:08:57,869
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
- DARA SUFFERED FROM
  CONGENITAL SPINAL DEFORMITIES.

87
00:08:57,869 --> 00:08:59,871
SHE'S BEEN
WHEELCHAIR-BOUND
HER WHOLE LIFE.

88
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:03,391
- COULD SOMEBODY HAVE
  TAKEN HER OUT OF HER ROOM ?
- LANCE SAW HER WALKING,

89
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:07,479
AND WHEN HE FOUND HER,
SHE WAS ON HER KNEES
PRAYING.

90
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:11,800
I THINK THAT'S
THE HARDEST PART
FOR MY HUSBAND.

91
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,303
HE'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND
HOW GOD COULD...

92
00:09:15,303 --> 00:09:17,555
FORSAKE THE LIFE
OF AN INNOCENT GIRL;

93
00:09:17,555 --> 00:09:22,777
HOW GOD, IN HIS MERCY
COULD LET THIS HAPPEN
TO OUR DARA.

94
00:09:22,777 --> 00:09:24,612
MRS. KERNOF WAS TALKING
ABOUT HER HUSBAND,

95
00:09:24,612 --> 00:09:26,898
BUT SHE MIGHT AS WELL
HAVE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT ME.

96
00:09:27,365 --> 00:09:29,351
YOU, TOO, WERE ANGRY AT GOD ?

97
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:38,793
I FELT DRAWN
TO THESE PEOPLE, FATHER,

98
00:09:38,793 --> 00:09:42,797
IN A VERY PERSONAL WAY.

99
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:46,301
I WAS DETERMINED TO HELP THEM
UNDERSTAND WHY THEIR DAUGHTER
HAD BEEN TAKEN.

100
00:09:46,301 --> 00:09:48,970
AND DID YOU ?

101
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:56,195
AS MUCH AS I HAVE
MY FAITH, FATHER,
I AM A SCIENTIST...

102
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:58,697
TRAINED TO WEIGH
EVIDENCE.

103
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,638
BUT SCIENCE ONLY
TEACHES US HOW.

104
00:10:06,638 --> 00:10:08,807
NOT WHY.

105
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:10,809
IF YOU WANT ME TO STAND
BY MY REPORT, I WILL,

106
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,313
BUT I HAVE TO SAY IT'S
NOT EXACTLY OPEN AND SHUT
ON THE CAUSE OF DEATH.

107
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:17,216
- YOU THINK IT WAS LIGHTNING ?
- I'M GUESSING IT WAS LIGHTNING.

108
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,218
THE WAY HER EYES
WERE BURNED...

109
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:22,721
SUGGESTS THE BOLT MAY HAVE
GONE TO GROUND, RIGHT THROUGH
THE TOP OF HER HEAD.

110
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:26,625
FUNNY THING IS, THERE WAS
NO OTHER SIGN OF ARCING,
EXCEPT FOR THE FACE.

111
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,344
HER MOTHER SAID
THAT SHE WAS FOUND
IN A KNEELING POSITION.

112
00:10:29,344 --> 00:10:32,097
GENUFLECTING.

113
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:35,601
ARE YOU A RELIGIOUS PERSON ?
WHY DO YOU ASK ?

114
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,603
I HAVEN'T BEEN TO CHURCH
SINCE I WAS A KID,

115
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,022
BUT I WENT LAST SUNDAY.

116
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:42,024
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

117
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:46,528
HER BODY WAS RIGORED SUCH
THAT I HAD TO DO
MY EXAMINATION...

118
00:10:46,528 --> 00:10:48,530
IN THE POSITION
SHE WAS FOUND.

119
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,652
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

120
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,239
LOOKS LIKE THERE WAS SURGERY
DONE ON HER HANDS.

121
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,058
SHE WAS POLYDACTYL.
SAME WITH HER FEET.

122
00:11:00,058 --> 00:11:03,061
I HAVEN'T ASKED HER PARENTS YET,
HAVEN'T HAD THE HEART TO,

123
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:06,064
BUT I ASSUME THEY HAD
THE EXTRA FINGERS REMOVED.

124
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,533
WHAT'S THE CONNECTION ?

125
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:11,820
I FOUND NO OTHER EVIDENCE
OF ANY OTHER TISSUE DAMAGE...

126
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,090
OR ELECTRICAL BURNS
 OR ANY OTHER SERIOUS TRAUMA.

127
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,709
IT'S AS IF GOD HIMSELF
STRUCK HER DOWN.

128
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,580
DARA KERNOF WAS ADOPTED.

129
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,583
I DON'T SUPPOSE THAT YOU'VE
REQUESTED ANY INFORMATION
ABOUT THE BIRTH MOTHER.

130
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:28,303
- I CAN DO THAT IF YOU LIKE.
- NO, THAT'S OKAY.  I, UH--

131
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:30,305
I HAVE SOMEONE I CAN ASK.

132
00:11:30,806 --> 00:11:34,059
SOMEBODY I'D LIKE
TO CONFER WITH, ACTUALLY.

133
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:03,005
KOKLOS.  PAULA KOKLOS.
ROOM 213.

134
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:06,508
WE'LL GET HER THINGS PACKED UP
AND GET YOU ON YOUR WAY.

135
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:22,491
[ Man ]
HOLD IT !

136
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,409
JUST HOLD IT.

137
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,246
ARE YOU FATHER GREGORY ?

138
00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:29,848
YES.

139
00:12:29,848 --> 00:12:33,135
I'M AARON STARKEY
WITH THE DEPARTMENT
OF SOCIAL SERVICES.

140
00:12:33,135 --> 00:12:35,020
I AM VERY SORRY,
BUT WE'VE HAD A MIX-UP.

141
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,973
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ?
- YOUR ADOPTION PETITION
  FOR PAULA KOKLOS.

142
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:39,808
IT'S MISSING AN APPROVAL.

143
00:12:39,808 --> 00:12:42,561
I'VE GOT THE COURT ORDER.
THAT'S THE MIX-UP.

144
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:45,063
SEE, IT NEVER SHOULD HAVE
GONE TO FAMILY COURT...

145
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:48,066
WITHOUT GETTING AN APPROVAL
FROM THE SOCIAL WORKER
ASSIGNED TO THE CASE,

146
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:49,851
AND THAT'S ME.

147
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:52,170
GIVE IT TO ME HERE THEN
AND WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY.

148
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,074
I CAN'T, AT LEAST NOT YET.
I'VE JUST BEEN ASSIGNED
TO PAULA,

149
00:12:56,074 --> 00:12:58,944
SO I'LL NEED TIME
TO FAMILIARIZE MYSELF
WITH HER CASE.

150
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:03,348
LOOK, I'VE ALREADY
BEEN THROUGH ALL THIS.
I'M HERE TO TAKE THE GIRL HOME.

151
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:05,851
I'M SORRY, FATHER,
BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT...

152
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,853
UNTIL I CAN GET
THE PAPERWORK IN ORDER.

153
00:13:50,962 --> 00:13:52,964
[ Phone Ringing ]

154
00:13:55,016 --> 00:13:57,335
HELLO.

155
00:13:57,335 --> 00:13:59,538
HEY, SCULLY.
I'M RETURNING YOUR CALL.

156
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:02,307
HI.  UH,
SOMETHING'S COME UP.

157
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:05,644
I WAS HOPING THAT YOU
COULD DO ME A FAVOR.

158
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,012
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

159
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,898
THIS ISN'T OFFICIAL
F.B.I. BUSINESS,

160
00:14:10,398 --> 00:14:12,734
SO I WAS HOPING
THAT WE COULD KEEP IT
OUTSIDE OF WORK.

161
00:14:12,734 --> 00:14:18,673
HEY, LOOK, I'M KIND OF TAILING
A POSSIBLE SUSPECT RIGHT NOW,
SO I'M KIND OF RUSHED, SO, UH--

162
00:14:18,673 --> 00:14:22,677
I NEED SOME BIRTH
AND ADOPTIVE RECORDS
ON A DARA KERNOF.

163
00:14:22,677 --> 00:14:26,581
- WHO ?
- DARA KERNOF.

164
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:28,967
I CAN'T TELL YOU MUCH MORE
THAN THAT, MULDER.
I'M SORRY.

165
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:31,169
YOU WANT TO GIVE ME A HINT ?
ANYTHING ?

166
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:33,538
NOT UNTIL YOU GET ME
THOSE RECORDS.

167
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:35,740
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

168
00:15:47,978 --> 00:15:49,863
[ Mulder ]
SCULLY ?

169
00:15:49,863 --> 00:15:53,817
AREN'T YOU
THE SECRET SQUIRREL.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

170
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:56,820
GOT A LOOK AT THAT BODY
THEY WHEELED OUT OF HERE.
YOU'VE BEEN HOLDING OUT.

171
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:01,341
MULDER, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
I DIDN'T WANT TO INVOLVE YOU.

172
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:04,812
I GOT ASKED
TO LOOK INTO THIS
AS A FAVOR FOR A FAMILY.

173
00:16:04,812 --> 00:16:07,214
DARA KERNOF'S FAMILY ?

174
00:16:07,214 --> 00:16:09,967
YOU FOUND DARA'S RECORDS ?
NO.  THOSE ARE
HER BIRTH RECORDS.

175
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:12,786
THE ADOPTION RECORDS
HAVE BEEN SEALED.

176
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:15,572
I THINK ONE OF MY QUESTIONS
HAS ALREADY BEEN ANSWERED.

177
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:17,808
DARA WAS A TWIN.
NO.

178
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:20,778
ACTUALLY,
SHE WAS A QUADRUPLET,
ONE OF FOUR GIRLS.

179
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:23,781
WAS THIS CROSS
FOUND LIKE THIS ?

180
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:29,570
YES, AS FAR AS I KNOW.  WHY ?
IT'S INVERTED.
UPSIDE-DOWN.

181
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,356
THAT'S A PROTEST,
A SACRILEGE AGAINST THE CHURCH.

182
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:35,726
PUT THERE BY WHOM ?

183
00:16:35,726 --> 00:16:39,229
IT'S YOUR CASE,
REMEMBER, SCULLY ?
DO YOU HAVE ANY SUSPECTS ?

184
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:44,234
NOT AS OF THIS TIME.
COULD THE VICTIM
HAVE PLACED IT ?

185
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:47,237
UH, IT'S DOUBTFUL.

186
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:50,240
PAULA KOKLOS WAS
SEVERELY IMPAIRED...

187
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,194
PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY,
AS WAS DARA KERNOF.

188
00:16:54,194 --> 00:16:55,863
THEY BOTH DIED
THE SAME WAY ?

189
00:16:55,863 --> 00:16:58,565
IT APPEARS THAT THEIR EYES
WERE BURNT OUT.

190
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:03,053
THEIR BODIES FROZEN
IN A POSITION OF PRAYER.

191
00:17:03,053 --> 00:17:05,355
THEIR PHYSICAL DEFORMITIES
COULD ACCOUNT FOR THAT.

192
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:07,524
THEY MIGHT.

193
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:12,379
LOOK, SCULLY, I KNOW YOU DON'T
REALLY WANT MY HELP ON THIS,

194
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:15,182
BUT CAN I OFFER YOU
MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION ?

195
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,721
YOU GOT A BONA FIDE,
SUPER-CRAZY RELIGIOUS WACKO
ON YOUR HANDS.

196
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:22,472
WHAT MAKES YOU
SO SURE ?

197
00:17:22,472 --> 00:17:25,893
THE MOTE IN THE EYE, THE EYES
AS THE WINDOW TO THE SOUL,
EYE FOR AN EYE.

198
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:28,395
HE'S WORKING FROM
ANCIENT SCRIPTURE,

199
00:17:28,395 --> 00:17:30,397
ANCIENT TEXT,
MAYBE EVEN THE BIBLE.

200
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:32,699
HE MAY EVEN THINK
HE'S DOING GOD'S WORK.

201
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:35,702
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING ?

202
00:17:35,702 --> 00:17:39,957
MY NAME IS AARON STARKEY.
I'M THE SOCIAL WORKER
ASSIGNED TO PAULA KOKLOS.

203
00:17:39,957 --> 00:17:43,944
THIS IS SO TRAGIC.
I JUST HOPE YOU CATCH
WHOEVER DID THIS.

204
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:48,549
MR. STARKEY, DO YOU KNOW
IF THAT CROSS OVER THERE
BELONGED TO PAULA ?

205
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:50,551
I DON'T REMEMBER
SEEING IT BEFORE.

206
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:52,386
I'M SURE IT DIDN'T.

207
00:17:52,386 --> 00:17:55,222
DID SHE HAVE ANY VISITORS
OR ANYBODY WHO MIGHT HAVE
LEFT IT BEHIND ?

208
00:17:55,222 --> 00:17:57,558
WELL, SHE HAD NO FAMILY.

209
00:17:57,558 --> 00:17:59,326
NO FRIENDS, REALLY.

210
00:17:59,826 --> 00:18:03,130
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNEW THIS,
BUT PAULA WAS ABOUT
TO BE ADOPTED.

211
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,399
BY WHO ?

212
00:18:48,675 --> 00:18:50,677
SCULLY, LOOK AT THIS.

213
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:56,433
THE GNOSTIC GOSPELS,
BOOK OF ENOCH, BOOK OF "J,"

214
00:18:56,433 --> 00:19:00,537
[ Breathing ]
APOCRYPHA.

215
00:19:00,537 --> 00:19:04,891
I'M SURPRISED
THERE'S NOTHING HERE
FROMJESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR.

216
00:19:04,891 --> 00:19:08,645
WHAT KIND OF CHURCH
IS THIS ?
THERE'S NO TELLING.

217
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,100
- CAN I HELP YOU ?
- FATHER GREGORY ?

218
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,851
YES.
I'M DANA SCULLY.

219
00:19:17,304 --> 00:19:19,640
WE'RE HERE ABOUT
THE DEATH OF PAULA KOKLOS.

220
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,909
OH, GOD, NO.

221
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:26,229
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, FATHER ?

222
00:19:26,229 --> 00:19:30,484
I WAS TRYING TO ADOPT PAULA.
I'M SURE YOU KNEW THAT.

223
00:19:30,484 --> 00:19:33,637
WE HEAR YOU WERE
VERY ANXIOUS TO DO SO.

224
00:19:33,637 --> 00:19:38,025
I-I HOPE TO GOD YOU'RE
NOT SUGGESTING I HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.

225
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:41,345
- WHY ADOPT HER ?
- YOU THINK I WAS INTERESTED
  IN HARMING HER ?

226
00:19:41,345 --> 00:19:43,947
WHY ADOPT HER ?

227
00:19:43,947 --> 00:19:49,553
I-I WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT HER.
I KNEW HER MOTHER.

228
00:19:49,553 --> 00:19:53,023
- DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS ?
- YES.

229
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:56,960
WE WERE LOOKING FOR HER NAME.
IT'S NOT LISTED ON THE GIRLS'
BIRTH RECORDS.

230
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,631
- WHY WOULD YOU WANT IT ?
- THE OTHER TWO GIRLS
  MAY BE IN DANGER.

231
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:04,001
WE'RE HOPING THAT SHE MIGHT
BE ABLE TO HELP US FIND THEM.

232
00:20:04,001 --> 00:20:07,270
THEIR MOTHER DIED
IN CHILDBIRTH.

233
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,092
CAN YOU GIVE US A NAME ?

234
00:20:14,061 --> 00:20:16,063
WHEN I WAS A PRIEST
IN THE ROMAN CHURCH,

235
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:19,533
BEFORE I FOUNDED MY OWN,
I WAS HER CONFESSOR.

236
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:24,087
DIVULGING HER NAME
WOULD VIOLATE
THE CODE OF MY FAITH.

237
00:20:25,288 --> 00:20:27,007
AND YOURS, I SEE.

238
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:31,278
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO PROTECT PAULA.
FROM WHAT ?

239
00:20:31,278 --> 00:20:33,630
WHATEVER YOUR INTENTIONS,

240
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,584
YOUR SECULAR PREJUDICES
BLIND YOU FROM SEEING WHAT'S
REALLY HAPPENING HERE.

241
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:41,638
TWO GIRLS ARE DEAD,
NOT BY THE HAND OF MAN.

242
00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:44,157
UNLESS YOU ACCEPT THE TRUTH
OF GOD'S TEACHINGS...

243
00:20:44,658 --> 00:20:47,661
THAT THERE IS A STRUGGLE
BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL
FOR ALL SOULS...

244
00:20:48,161 --> 00:20:51,048
AND THAT WE ARE LOSING
THAT STRUGGLE, YOU'RE
BUT FOOLS RUSHING IN.

245
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,252
YOU PUT YOUR OWN LIVES
IN DANGER,

246
00:20:55,252 --> 00:20:57,054
AS WELL AS THE LIVES
OF THE MESSENGERS.

247
00:21:00,107 --> 00:21:02,275
I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY.

248
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:16,840
I BROUGHT AGENT MULDER
ON THE CASE TO HELP
TEMPER MY FEELINGS;

249
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,342
TO KEEP THEM FROM
CLOUDING MY JUDGMENT.

250
00:21:22,345 --> 00:21:24,848
I WOULDN'T ADMIT IT
TO HIM, BUT...

251
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:31,855
AS WE STOOD THERE,
I FELT AS IF FATHER GREGORY
WERE SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO ME...

252
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:36,860
IN A LANGUAGE
ONLY I COULD UNDERSTAND.

253
00:21:38,361 --> 00:21:40,363
[ Priest ]
THE MESSENGERS.

254
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:45,368
YES.

255
00:21:45,368 --> 00:21:47,971
I KNOW PEOPLE
IN GLASS HOUSES
SHOULDN'T THROW STONES,

256
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:50,807
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,
BUT THAT GUY IS PARANOID.

257
00:21:50,807 --> 00:21:53,727
I THINK YOU'RE A LITTLE EXTREME
IN YOUR JUDGMENT,
DON'T YOU, MULDER ?

258
00:21:53,727 --> 00:21:57,731
ALL THAT CRAP ABOUT
THE FIGHT FOR ALL SOULS,
THE LITERATURE WE SAW,

259
00:21:57,731 --> 00:21:59,733
THE PERFORMANCE
WE JUST WITNESSED,
IT ALL FITS.

260
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:01,618
HE THINKS HE'S DOING
GOD'S LAUNDRY.

261
00:22:01,618 --> 00:22:05,539
WELL, HE SAID THIS WASN'T
DONE BY THE HAND OF MAN.
YOU THINK HE BELIEVES THAT TOO ?

262
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:08,291
IF HE DOES, HE'S EVEN
MORE DANGEROUS
THAN HE APPEARS.

263
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,477
EVEN IF
HE'S NOT YOUR KILLER,
HE IS HIDING SOMETHING.

264
00:22:10,477 --> 00:22:13,380
- WHAT ?
- HE SAYS HE KNEW THE MOTHER,
  BUT HE WON'T GIVE UP HER NAME.

265
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,298
MAYBE SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

266
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:19,169
I THINK YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO
BRING HIM IN FOR QUESTIONING,
IF NOT MAKE AN ARREST.

267
00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:24,307
BUT, BASICALLY,
YOU'RE RULING OUT ANY ELEMENT
OF THE SUPERNATURAL.

268
00:22:25,575 --> 00:22:27,444
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

269
00:22:27,444 --> 00:22:30,897
WELL, DARA KERNOF WAS BAPTIZED
ON THE DAY OF HER DEATH.

270
00:22:30,897 --> 00:22:36,152
SHE WAS SANCTIFIED
BY THE RITUAL SACRAMENT,
SUBMERGED IN THE SPIRIT.

271
00:22:36,152 --> 00:22:37,754
AND WHY WOULD GOD
ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN ?

272
00:22:37,754 --> 00:22:41,091
WHY DO BAD THINGS
HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE ?

273
00:22:41,091 --> 00:22:45,061
RELIGION HAS MASQUERADED
AS THE PARANORMAL
SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME...

274
00:22:45,061 --> 00:22:48,064
TO JUSTIFY SOME OF THE MOST
HORRIBLE ACTS IN HISTORY.

275
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,801
I WAS RAISED TO BELIEVE
THAT GOD HAS HIS REASONS,
HOWEVER MYSTERIOUS.

276
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:56,189
HE MAY HAVE HIS REASONS,
BUT SEEMS TO USE PSYCHOTICS
TO CARRY OUT HIS JOB ORDERS.

277
00:22:58,008 --> 00:23:02,862
YOU WANNA FIND WHO DID THIS ?
I SUGGEST YOU AUTOPSY THE BODY
BEFORE IT'S INTERRED;

278
00:23:02,862 --> 00:23:05,749
BEFORE THE MAN WHO
KILLED HER HAS A CHANCE
TO FIND HER SISTERS.

279
00:23:09,135 --> 00:23:12,105
[ Scully ]
THE VICTIM IS PAULA KOKLOS,

280

AGE 16,
CAUSE OF DEATH UNKNOWN.

281
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:19,946
I'LL BEGIN WITH
THE EXTERNAL EXAMINATION.

282
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:28,572
VICTIM HAS SIGNS OF
CONGENITAL PHYSICAL DEFECTS,

283
00:23:29,072 --> 00:23:32,359
INCLUDING
FOUR SUPERNUMERARY DIGITS.

284
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:38,148
THE ONLY INDICATIONS
OF EXTERNAL TRAUMA
ARE THE BURNING,

285
00:23:38,148 --> 00:23:42,152
BY MEANS UNKNOWN,
OF BOTH GLOBES OF THE EYES.

286
00:23:42,152 --> 00:23:45,305
I'M NOTING SOMETHING
ON THE SHOULDER,

287
00:23:45,305 --> 00:23:49,175
A BONY PROCESS OF SOME KIND,
POSSIBLY A TUMOROUS MASS.

288
00:23:49,175 --> 00:23:53,113
NO INDICATION
OF SURGICAL PROCEDURE.

289
00:23:58,618 --> 00:24:01,921
THE MASS APPEARS ON BOTH
 THE RIGHT AND LEFT CLAVICLE.

290
00:24:15,318 --> 00:24:17,320
OH, GOD.

291
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:28,281
MOMMY ?

292
00:24:30,266 --> 00:24:32,569
MOMMY, PLEASE.

293
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:05,085
I TOLD MYSELF THAT
IT WAS ALL IN MY HEAD,

294
00:25:05,085 --> 00:25:10,090
A HALLUCINATION BROUGHT ON
BY MY EMOTIONAL CONNECTION
TO THE CASE.

295
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:14,594
THAT WOULD SEEM TO BE
A REASONABLE EXPLANATION.

296
00:25:14,594 --> 00:25:19,099
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT IT WAS, FATHER.

297
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:22,602
I WAS MEANT
TO SEE EMILY...

298
00:25:22,602 --> 00:25:24,604
FOR A PURPOSE.

299
00:25:24,604 --> 00:25:26,606
WHICH WAS ?

300
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,362
TO SAVE THESE GIRLS.

301
00:25:32,362 --> 00:25:35,065
[ Mulder ]
HEY, SCULLY, IT'S ME.

302
00:25:35,065 --> 00:25:39,302
I DID A LITTLE MORE DIGGING
ON THOSE ADOPTION RECORDS.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

303
00:25:39,302 --> 00:25:41,504
I THINK I GOT A LEAD
ON THAT THIRD SISTER.

304
00:25:41,504 --> 00:25:44,357
WHERE ?
SHE WAS UNDER COUNTY CARE
TEN YEARS AGO.

305
00:25:44,858 --> 00:25:49,696
APPARENTLY, SHE WANDERED INTO
A TEEN CRISIS CENTER HERE
IN D.C. LAST WEEK HOMELESS.

306
00:25:49,696 --> 00:25:52,198
THAT GUY OVER AT
SOCIAL SERVICES, STARKEY,

307
00:25:52,699 --> 00:25:54,701
HE'S HELPING ME
CANVASS THE AREA.

308
00:25:56,669 --> 00:26:00,390
IF SHE SHARES ANYTHING WITH
HER SISTERS, SHE WOULDN'T
BE WALKING ANYWHERE FAR.

309
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:05,128
WHAT DID YOU FIND ?
THERE'S EVIDENCE OF
A DEGENERATIVE BONE DISEASE.

310
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:10,033
AND I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
THINK THAT I'M CRAZY,

311
00:26:10,533 --> 00:26:13,036
BUT I SWEAR
I FOUND EVIDENCE
OF SOMETHING WINGLIKE.

312
00:26:13,036 --> 00:26:16,189
WELL, THEN MAYBE
SHE FLEW HERE, SCULLY.

313
00:26:16,189 --> 00:26:19,359
MULDER,
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

314
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:23,146
HOLD THAT THOUGHT AND TELL IT
TO ME AND FATHER GREGORY
WHEN YOU SEE US.

315
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:22,922
STOP RIGHT THERE !
MOVE INTO THE LIGHT !

316
00:27:22,922 --> 00:27:24,958
MOVE INTO THE LIGHT !
HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE 'EM !

317
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:30,547
WE'RE TOO LATE.

318
00:27:32,816 --> 00:27:34,801
- WHERE'S THE GIRL ?
- SHE'S DEAD.

319
00:27:34,801 --> 00:27:36,886
- WHERE IS SHE ?
- IN THERE.

320

[ Wings Flapping ]

RECONCILE THIS BELIEF WITH
THE PHYSICAL FACT OF HER DEATH ?

NO.
