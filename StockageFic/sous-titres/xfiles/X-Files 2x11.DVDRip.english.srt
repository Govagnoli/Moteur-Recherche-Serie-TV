1
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,871
<i>Hall trying to stay away from him.</i>

2
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,591
Come on, man. Come on.

3
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,470
Come on, now. Put him down.

4
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,551
Put him down!

5
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,551
- Oh!
- Hey, man. Watch it!

6
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,598
- Come on, Upshaw! Let's go!
- You're a moron, Tiernan.

7
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,275
You're both morons.
And who's watching the floor?

8
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,429
- Whatshisname, the skink.
- Guess who died this afternoon.

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,077
- Mrs Richardson.
- Face plant in a bowl of puddin'.

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,678
- I don't suppose you changed her room.
- Oh, no. We left that for you.

11
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,192
Oh!

12
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,748
<i>Now Hall's against the ropes!</i>

13
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,111
OK. Party's over, gents.

14
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,236
Why'd you do that?

15
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,311
- Cos rules are rules, Stan.
- Ach!

16
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,790
And I'm the queen bitch around here.

17
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,839
- Gung said we can watch the fight.
- Yeah? Do I look like Gung to you?

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,911
No. You got a better figure.

19
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,193
You wanna keep that hand, Hal,
you better let go.

20
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,396
How about a little sponge bath?

21
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,916
How about I take care of
these wanderin' hands of yours?

22
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,031
Come here.

23
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,314
- You like strappin' me down, don't you?
- Oh, yeah. I really get off on it.

24
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,839
Hey, Gung. No TV after nine o'clock.
Do you understand?

25
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,311
- Dr Grago said they're getting better...
- Oh, right!

26
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,030
That's because they don't pinch <i>his</i> butt
every time he walks into the room.

27
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,671
Argh!

28
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,151
Oh!

29
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,111
No!

30
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,316
Somebody help me!

31
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,676
Somebody, please! Please!

32
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,559
Help me! Please, help me! Please!

33
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,231
Good morning.

34
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,278
Whatever tape you found in that VCR,
it isn't mine.

35
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,148
Good, because I put it back
with all those others that aren't yours.

36
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,154
Well, this definitely isn't mine.

37
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,629
No. This is Michelle Charters.

38
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,190
She's a nurse at a convalescent home
in Worcester, Massachusetts.

39
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,831
- What happened to her?
- According to Miss Charters, she was raped.

40
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,599
The abrasions would be consistent with
her claims, as would be the medical report...

41
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,559
...which cites the kind of injury
associated with sexual trauma.

42
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,077
- Where'd you get this? Violent Crimes?
- No, the woman made the video herself.

43
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,276
No one will believe her story.

44
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,113
Why not?

45
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,558
Because she claims to have been raped
by an invisible entity, a spirit being.

46
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,200
I have X-Files that document similar cases.

47
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,593
- I know. I've been going through them.
- None of them have ever been substantiated.

48
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,150
- Not surprisingly.
- Given the emotional violence of rape...

49
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,437
...the face of the attacker
is often erased from memory.

50
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,433
That he could be perceived as invisible
is a logical leap from there.

51
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,909
- Yes, but this case is different.
- Why?

52
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,719
She has filed a lawsuit
against the government.

53
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,758
She seems to be certain
who the spirit being is.

54
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,634
Mr Arden.

55
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,314
- Hal Arden.
- <i>(Scully)</i> And you know him?

56
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,597
He's been a patient where I work
for about five years.

57
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,639
The facts of your case seem to contravene
those of other cases we have.

58
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,111
Right. You mean, the other
"woman raped by invisible man" cases?

59
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,714
How do you know it was him
who attacked you?

60
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,791
He made advances toward me.

61
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,871
And he said things, rude things.

62
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,030
When you bathe somebody every day...

63
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,635
...you get to know more about them
than you really need to.

64
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,312
An old man smells a certain way...

65
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,391
...and he feels a certain way.

66
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,556
- I know this is hard for you.
- No, this is the easy part.

67
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,753
"Hard" is not getting leave
or workman's comp...

68
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,832
...and having to go back
to work with this... guy.

69
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,836
To continue our investigation, we're
gonna need some evidence, physical or...

70
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,354
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. I've heard it.

71
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,639
Unless you have hair or semen or fibres
or whatever, you guys can't build a case.

72
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,711
That's right.

73
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,394
Look, I didn't make this up, OK?

74
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,191
I <i>was</i> attacked.

75
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,791
And I'm not a shrinking violet who would
repress the memory of a rapist's face.

76
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,954
If I could positively ID him or give you
something to incriminate the man, I would.

77
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,199
<i>(laughs)</i>

78
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,271
You gotta be kidding me!

79
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,914
What do I think about her claims? Huh!

80
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,434
I should be in the Guinness Record Book.

81
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,673
I'm 74 years old. I've got plumbing
older than this building.

82
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,831
Hm?

83
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,873
And it don't work much better either.

84
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,829
Thank you for sharing. Are you aware you're
named in a lawsuit against the government?

85
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,310
- I am?
- Did you ever threaten Miss Charters?

86
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,235
- What?
- Did you ever threaten Miss Charters?

87
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,676
Threaten? It was harmless,
for cryin' out loud.

88
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,392
Ever since this sex-harassment fad,
men can't say what's on their minds.

89
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,437
- She says you made advances.
- Hm?

90
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,758
Advances?

91
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,233
If I told you you were a pretty woman and
I would like to show you some affection...

92
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,709
...would you be offended?

93
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,555
Oh, I didn't mean to step on your toes there.

94
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,833
Sir, there seems to be some confusion here.

95
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,232
Yeah. I thought nurse whatshername
said she was rogered by a ghost.

96
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,074
I may have one foot in the grave, but
I can't fly down hallways spreading <i>amore.</i>

97
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,711
Apparently not.

98
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,112
Lf... that's what it's like...

99
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,589
If that's what it's like in heaven...

100
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,671
...Lord, take me now!

101
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,593
- What do you think, Mulder?
- About his plumbing?

102
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,150
- About his story.
- I think this is gonna be a waste of time...

103
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,993
...like all the other X-Files on entity rape.

104
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,275
Unsubstantiated phenomena.

105
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,351
But in a substantiated crime.

106
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,432
Hey, pay attention or you'll take
another bath with your clothes on.

107
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,472
At five and a half bucks an hour,
I don't give a rat's ass either way.

108
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,913
Ten years ago, Excelsis was
a leading facility in care of the elderly.

109
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,673
Then funding was cut.
We were all but shut down.

110
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,639
- Only a few wings are operational now.
- Is there a medical staff?

111
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,837
Not on site.
Dr Grago visits three times a week.

112
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,552
Residents are very well looked after, though.
We have a high standard of health treatment.

113
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,677
- What kind of treatment?
- We specialise in the care...

114
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,230
...of the degenerative diseases:
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's.

115
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,835
- We met with a patient today.
- We prefer "resident", actually.

116
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,074
We met a resident who has Alzheimer's,
but he actually seemed quite spry and alert.

117
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,151
You're speaking of Hal Arden, the man
accused of assaulting Michelle Charters.

118
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,358
- Was he receiving special treatment?
- You'd have to speak to Dr Grago.

119
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,512
Hal has been here almost eight years now.

120
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,716
We're all quite fond of him.

121
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,952
We were extremely dismayed
over this whole business with the lawsuit.

122
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,079
Are you saying you don't believe
Nurse Charters' allegations of rape?

123
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,355
There's something I'd like to show you.

124
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,992
- What did you tell 'em?
- I didn't tell 'em anything.

125
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,676
- Why are they still here?
- I don't know, Stan.

126
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,596
- Now, you gotta be more careful.
- I <i>am</i> careful.

127
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,194
You're gonna ruin it for all of us.

128
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,794
If they find out, it all goes for nothin'.

129
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,351
I didn't tell 'em anything.

130
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,716
I'm not going to die in this godforsaken hole!
Do you hear me?

131
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,791
Oh, back off, Stan.

132
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,031
Where did you get that?

133
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,468
I know where he keeps 'em.

134
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,629
Give me one, Stan. Huh?

135
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,549
I want another one, too.

136
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,631
You can't handle another one.

137
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,919
Oh, yeah? Maybe I'll just
rat you out, then, huh?

138
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,031
How would you like that?

139
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,957
- This is Michelle Charters'?
- There are three separate insurance claims...

140
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,031
...for accidents on the job.

141
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:50,389
In April, she requested leave with full pay
due to job-related emotional stress.

142
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,477
The request was summarily rejected.
There's more.

143
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,028
- I'd like to review it myself.
- Certainly.

144
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,079
Mrs Dawson, did you see Michelle
after the incident and her injuries?

145
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,436
I wasn't here that night,
but I did see her the following day.

146
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,159
- Then you know how badly she was hurt.
- Yes.

147
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,951
- Do you think she staged the attack?
- We need help. Mr Arden's choking to death!

148
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,149
<i>(Stan)</i> See? See what happened?

149
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,110
I told you you couldn't handle any more!

150
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,751
<i>(Scully)</i> Call 911!

151
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,919
<i>(Scully)</i> Hal? Can you speak?

152
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,675
He's in ventricular fibrillation.

153
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,752
I need 75mg of lidocaine
and one amp of epinephrine.

154
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,231
- Stat.
- <i>(Scully)</i> Get a defibrillator! He's cyanotic.

155
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,312
- <i>(Scully)</i> Come on, Hal, help me.
- <i>(Mulder)</i> Come on, Hal.

156
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,279
- <i>(Dawson) One,</i> two, three, four.
- <i>(Tiernan)</i> The ambulance is on the way.

157
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,238
<i>(Scully)</i> I'm losing him.
What's taking so long?!

158
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,517
<i>(Dawson)</i> Still no pulse.
Where's that crash cart?!

159
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,549
Hal Arden's been my patient
since he came here eight years ago.

160
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,029
- This really is a setback.
- A setback?

161
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,795
Hal was part of a group of patients
I've been treating for 11 months.

162
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,670
- But Alzheimer's isn't treatable.
- It's an experimental drug called Depranil...

163
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,752
...that increases acetylcholine in the brain.

164
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,276
I've read that the clinical benefits
are marginal at best.

165
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,509
Well, yes.

166
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,436
But these patients show cognitive abilities
well beyond anything that's been reported.

167
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,829
So he was actually getting better?

168
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,550
Before he started receiving the drug
he could hardly complete a sentence.

169
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,474
Look... It's not much
to get excited about, my work.

170
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,313
Most of these people
are on the downhill slide.

171
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,757
If I can make them comfortable,
maybe prolong a life, it's all they expect.

172
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,956
But to reverse an illness...

173
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,874
Would it be possible for us to see
other patients in your test group?

174
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,349
- Sure, if you want to.
- Yeah.

175
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,431
<i>(siren)</i>

176
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,038
- Where'd you get that?
- Aw, it was Hal's.

177
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,872
Since he's not here any more,
why can't I have it?

178
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,509
Because you have enough.
I give you enough. It's our secret.

179
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,792
Aw, come on, Gung. It's makin' me better.

180
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,230
Too much is very bad.

181
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,471
<i>Very</i> bad. No more for you.

182
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,039
I want you to stand behind Ben, Eddie,
because Ben's taller.

183
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,476
And... Oh, Gloria,
would you come on over here?

184
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,997
That man there, that's Leo Kreutzer.
During the Depression he was a WPA artist.

185
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,392
- Quite a good one, too, I'm told.
- Hello, Mabel. Don't you look lovely!

186
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,517
- Is he receiving the same treatment as Hal?
- Yes.

187
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,674
When he came to us he couldn't draw a circle.
Now... Well, you can see for yourself.

188
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,079
You'll have to excuse me.
I'm behind on rounds.

189
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,628
Can I get a copy of Hal's autopsy results?

190
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,950
- Of course.
- Thank you.

191
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,031
May I sit down, Leo?

192
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,835
Leo, we're with the FBI. We have
some questions that we'd like to ask you.

193
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,630
Leo's a brilliant artist, you know.

194
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,271
Oh, don't be so modest, Leo.

195
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,431
President Kennedy has one of
his paintings in the White House.

196
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,590
<i>(sighs)</i>

197
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,958
Dr Grago tells us that you haven't
worked in years, that the medicine...

198
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,110
It ain't the medication.

199
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,151
What is it, then?

200
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,959
OK, Rembrandt, dinner time.
Dorothy, legs up and straight ahead.

201
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,157
- You don't want a flat tyre.
- Wait! Leo's not finished.

202
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,276
Leo can finish with you later.

203
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,353
- No, no... He still has to draw the rest.
- He'll do it later, honey.

204
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,558
Come on, Leo. Don't make me
embarrass you in front of your friends.

205
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,789
Come on, Scully. Let's get out of here.

206
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,195
To find a treatment <i>and</i> cure for Alzheimer's,
do you realise how important that would be?

207
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,158
If it'd keep anybody
out of a place like that, yes.

208
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,550
- I wouldn't say those people were cured.
- Any progress at all...

209
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,076
I hope somebody's making progress
cos we have a big goose egg.

210
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,869
- Checking out of room 206 and 210, please.
- Certainly, sir.

211
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:04,200
- What if there's a connection?
- Between the rape case and the Alzheimer's?

212
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,477
When they're not drawing pictures,
they're sex offenders?

213
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,472
Dr Grago's drug therapy
produces acetylcholine.

214
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,759
Too much cholinergic activity can cause
a psychotic state similar to schizophrenia.

215
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,628
You think Michelle Charters
was raped by a 74-year-old schizophrenic?

216
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,838
- It's possible.
- An invisible 74-year-old schizophrenic?

217
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,435
Maybe it's not the medication.
Maybe it's the place itself.

218
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,593
Are you saying it's haunted?
You've been working with me for too long.

219
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,593
I'm talking about an environmental reason
behind what's happening.

220
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,390
The disinfectant couldn't mask that smell.
Who knows what's behind the walls?

221
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,156
Some fungal contaminants have been known
to cause delusions, dementia, violence.

222
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,755
- Why hasn't it affected the other residents?
- Maybe it has.

223
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,752
You're looking too hard
for something that's not there.

224
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,197
I think Michelle Charters concocted
this story to get out of ajob she hates.

225
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,558
Her lip required 13 stitches. The blow to
her head caused a subdural haematoma.

226
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,553
That's quite a concoction.
I want to talk to a few more of the patients.

227
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,632
We can catch the same flight out
tomorrow night.

228
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,513
This is gourmet fare.
Be a good girl and open wide.

229
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,160
- No, no, no. Please don't.
- Come on.

230
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,552
- Come on, open up, honey. Come on!
- No, please don't. I don't want...

231
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,275
OK, that's fine, Dorothy.
Starve to death. See if I care.

232
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,391
<i>(Gung)</i> Why aren't you eating your food, Leo?
What's the matter?

233
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,790
It's Dorothy. She needs more.

234
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,871
We both do.

235
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,750
What you have is enough.

236
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,992
It's not working for us,
not like it works for the others.

237
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,275
- We need more.
- No!

238
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,309
No. Eat your food, please.

239
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,670
I'll come back and pick up your tray.

240
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,271
It's OK, Dorothy.

241
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,191
Don't worry.

242
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,636
I think Stan has some more
hidden away somewhere.

243
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,711
It'll be all right.

244
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,271
- Why are you being so stubborn?
- I'm not. I like it here.

245
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,717
- A year ago you were begging to live with us.
- Well, things change.

246
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,917
Look, Dad, I am sorry about
what happened to Mr Arlen.

247
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,754
- Arden. His name was Arden.
- I finished your packing, Mr Phillips.

248
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,832
I'm gonna make sure
you didn't forget anything.

249
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,357
OK. Don't worry. Just pull your car up front.
I'll make sure he gets down OK.

250
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,749
- Thank you.
- He's gonna be just fine.

251
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,358
- Can I help you?
- We'd like a word with Mr Phillips.

252
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,069
- I'm his daughter. What is this about?
- We're with the FBI.

253
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,358
We have a few questions
concerning his medical treatment.

254
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,832
He's in there packing.
I'm about to take him home.

255
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,229
Is there anything I can help you with?

256
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:11,555
It's sad. My two girls won't even visit their
grandfather. They're too afraid to come here.

257
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,438
It's hard for anyone, including the residents.

258
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,833
That's why we decided that whatever time
he's got left, we want him to spend it with us.

259
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,912
- How many years has he been here?
- Almost three.

260
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,074
We didn't have a choice.
Jack and I both work.

261
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,709
The doctor said that he needed
24-hour nursing assistance.

262
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,519
He doesn't seem to need
much assistance now.

263
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,273
Has his improvement been that pronounced?

264
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,874
I thought I was bringing him here to die.

265
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,750
They told me he'd only get worse -
the physical deterioration, the dementia.

266
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,799
- And now it's like he's a different person.
- Do you have any idea why?

267
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,436
It has something to do with Dr Grago's
treatment. Dad won't talk to me about it.

268
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,875
He's just too angry.

269
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,875
He was so angry when I brought him here.
Now he's angry that I wanna take him home.

270
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,758
I don't know that he's ever gonna forgive me.

271
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:11,870
I'd like to say I'm gonna miss you, Stan. But
the truth is, you are a royal pain in the butt.

272
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,430
Hey! Where you goin'?

273
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,351
Don't make me chase you, old man.

274
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,471
Hey!

275
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,274
What are you, a track star all of a sudden?

276
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,678
OK, stop messin' around, Stan.
Crawl back in that window right now!

277
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,671
You crawl back in there!

278
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,638
Don't think I'm comin' over there to get you.

279
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,712
I'd just as soon let you fall
and break your neck!

280
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,872
- <i>(whispering)</i>
- Do you hear me, Stan? Do you hear me?

281
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,749
Help me! Somebody help me, please!

282
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,831
I'm gonna fall!

283
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,435
<i>(whispering)</i>

284
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,237
<i>(whispering)</i>

285
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,431
Help!

286
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,672
Help me!

287
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,991
Give me your hand.

288
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,991
- Come on. Come on!
- I can't...

289
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,711
- Grab it!
- I can't!

290
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,350
Argh!

291
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,391
Oh, my God!

292
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,792
They paged me. I got a message -
an orderly fell out a fourth-floor window?

293
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,872
Apparently. Either that or he was pushed.

294
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,428
- Was Stan involved?
- We're trying to find out.

295
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:10,117
- Stan was with him just prior to the accident.
- You're not suggesting he could've done it?

296
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,988
There's been two deaths in 24 hours.
Stan's been present before both.

297
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,550
No, no. That's impossible.
He has a degenerative hip disease.

298
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,235
- No way could he get to the fourth floor.
- What about an elevator?

299
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,551
- They haven't worked for years.
- Maybe he was helped.

300
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,676
Helped? By whom?

301
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,631
<i>(Mulder)</i> I don't know.

302
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,913
The postmortem on Hal Arden.
Did you get it yet?

303
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,198
- No, but they promised they'll fax it today.
- Can we see if it's come in?

304
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,350
Sure. What do you expect to find?

305
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,797
I'm not sure exactly.

306
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,355
Why are they questioning him?

307
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,954
It's routine procedure.

308
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,353
Are they gonna want to keep him here?

309
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,431
You'll have to ask Dr Grago.

310
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,753
- Oh, God! If my mother was alive...
- <i>(Michelle)</i> How can I handle this by myself?

311
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,912
I don't know. I have other things
to deal with right now.

312
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,878
- Well, so do I. I'd just like some help.
- Excuse me.

313
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,999
- Are you the only one on?
- Yes. Upshaw never showed up for work.

314
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,071
Nobody's ever listening to me!

315
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:31,154
I said something was going on! I told you
it had to do with Mr Arden and Mr Phillips.

316
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,391
Forget it.

317
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,636
Can you please explain to me
what's going on around here?

318
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,711
<i>(Dorothy)</i> Shoo! Shoo!

319
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,791
Go away! Go, go away!

320
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,711
Leave me alone!

321
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,997
Go back! Don't come any closer!

322
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,275
Go back in your room, Dorothy.
I'll send an orderly in to see you.

323
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,510
- No, no, they're in there.
- Who?

324
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,591
All of them.

325
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,992
- There's nobody in your room, Dorothy.
- Here they come! You'll see.

326
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,108
All right, now. You be nice.
I don't want any more of your dirty tricks!

327
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,191
- Is she gonna be all right?
- Mm.

328
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,069
No! No, no, no!
I don't... I don't wanna go back in there.

329
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,752
No! No, I don't...

330
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,472
It's senile dementia. This is just an episode.

331
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,792
You leave her be. Don't you touch her!

332
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,032
Now, shoo! Go away! Go away!
Don't you get any ideas, mister!

333
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,431
Excuse me.

334
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,039
<i>(whispering)</i>

335
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,436
Now don't you follow her!

336
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,119
- This is it.
- Is the toxicology there?

337
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,191
Yes.

338
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,193
- This shouldn't be here.
- What's that?

339
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,114
- Ibotenic acid. How did that get in his blood?
- What's ibotenic acid?

340
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,919
- I think it's a kind of poison.
- Mulder...

341
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,393
Scully, look at this. Hal Arden had ibotenic
acid in his blood. Somebody poisoned him.

342
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,437
Well, not necessarily.
This is only a trace amount.

343
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,710
But small amounts can cause hallucinations,
which is what a patient is having right now.

344
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,553
- But where did they get it?
- <i>(knock at door)</i>

345
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,280
Excuse me. You've gotta come quickly.

346
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,351
Oh, my God!

347
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,673
- This is fantastic.
- What's going on here?

348
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,271
Leo?

349
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,551
<i>(Scully)</i> It's incredible.

350
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,190
You've got an Asian orderly working here.
What's his name?

351
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,636
- Uh... Gung, I think.
- Do you know where he is?

352
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,711
Somewhere down in the basement.

353
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,791
<i>(water trickles)</i>

354
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,391
Upshaw.

355
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,589
You must believe me. I didn't kill him.

356
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,513
- But it's your mushroom crop, isn't it?
- Yes.

357
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,875
- Who else would have buried him there?
- Why were you growing them?

358
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,951
For medicinal purposes.

359
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,508
Were you feeding them to the residents?

360
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,558
Yes. But only in small amounts.

361
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,031
Why?

362
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,509
Because it makes them feel better.

363
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,510
- It makes them feel better or it kills them?
- No.

364
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,514
Exactly what kind of mushrooms are they?

365
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,952
It's from my prefecture in my country.
They've been used for centuries.

366
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,031
For what purpose?

367
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,556
In my country our customs are different.

368
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,915
You're not in your country now.

369
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,198
You're hired here to care for
these people under <i>our</i> guidelines.

370
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,831
Where I come from,
many generations live under one roof.

371
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:19,630
As children, our grandparents live with us.
We feel a duty to take care of them.

372
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,790
It isn't like that in this country.

373
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:28,190
We respect our old people
as we respect our ancestors.

374
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:33,435
We don't send them away to die,
like Stan and Hal.

375
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:38,833
- These people get excellent medical care.
- But they're not treated with respect.

376
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,514
Hal's family never came to visit him once.

377
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,590
And the orderlies treat the residents
worse than dogs.

378
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,830
No one is mistreated here.

379
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,038
- You are not here to see.
- All right! Gung, who killed the orderly?

380
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,111
Who buried him in that room?

381
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,197
Something has gone very wrong.

382
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,831
The mushrooms we take to speak with the
dead, to see our ancestors in the spirit world.

383
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,153
But the spirit in this place is very angry...

384
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,272
...and the souls that died here
continue to suffer.

385
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,396
And now they have been awakened.

386
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,197
Are you saying that a spirit
killed this man Upshaw?

387
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,118
Yes.

388
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,112
They've taken revenge for their mistreatment.

389
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,231
How are the mushrooms taken?

390
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,638
Dried, mixed with many herbs,
made into powder.

391
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,789
We should make sure
nobody else takes them.

392
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,318
You check on the other patients.
Gung, come with me. Let's go.

393
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,951
Come in, please.

394
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,391
Someone's taken them all.

395
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,630
- I think you're right.
- About?

396
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:45,238
What's been happening here is a result of the
medication, but not the doctor's medication.

397
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,791
Mushrooms aren't medication. They're good
on burgers but they don't raise the dead.

398
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:54,431
Shamans have been using them for centuries
to gain entrance to the spirit world.

399
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,239
You've been reading
too much Carlos Castaneda.

400
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,914
All right. Ask any anthropologist, then.

401
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,429
I know. A shaman gets intoxicated, he has
dreams or hallucinations and interprets them.

402
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,273
I don't think it's any more magical than that.

403
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,796
I don't know how else to explain
what's happening here.

404
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,515
Well, I think these mushrooms
are a poison to the system...

405
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,591
...and that's what killed Hal Arden.

406
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:23,595
And raped Michelle Charters and killed those
two orderlies? Something's been unleashed.

407
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,231
I don't know how to explain it,
but it has something to do with those pills.

408
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,751
Daddy?

409
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,676
Daddy, what are you taking?

410
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,910
