The graph is recording
its output,

which, when I remove
the current, changes slightly,
but continues.

85
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,927

is storing information.

- Biological information?
- That was my first guess.

87

The chip was placed subcutaneous
to the back of the neck, right?

88
00:08:41,534 --> 00:08:44,662
So it makes sense that
it would be recording impulses...

89
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:47,262
traveling to and from

- But look at the graph.

91

Those are what we call
"reverberatory loops."

94
00:08:58,051 --> 00:09:01,145
Yeah. The chip seems to be
mimicking that process--

95
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:03,451
replicating the memory function
in the brain.

96

- Like a computer hard drive.
- Yeah, but no hard drive
we've ever seen.

97
00:09:07,894 --> 00:09:11,421
This kind of neural network could
be not only collecting information,

98
00:09:11,497 --> 00:09:16,525

a person's mental processes.

- Frightening.

00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,270
Anyway, I showed the chip
to some of my tech-heads,

101
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:29,975

as I thought they'd be.

They've seen
this technology before?

They've seen neural nets before,
but never as complex as that,

any time soon.

I effectively destroyed it
when I began working on it,

is that there is no such thing
as alien abduction.

Because I have what I told you
