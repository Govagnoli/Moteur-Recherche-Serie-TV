1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,512
I think we all feel an empty place.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,674
Everybody loved Jennifer.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,309
Not just because
she was a special person...

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,753
...but because she was the kind of friend
who was always there for you.

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,677
We'll miss you, Jen.

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,752
We'll miss your smile.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,035
<i>(sobbing)</i>

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,113
We'll miss the times
we would have spent together.

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,473
We'll keep these memories
close to our hearts...

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,399
...until we meet again in God's kingdom.

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,278

<i>(sobbing)</i>

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,119
The family has requested a graveside service.

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,998
I've rescheduled the burial
to tomorrow afternoon.

15
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,674
We'll keep the body overnight.

16
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,469
Such a beautiful girl.

17
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,751
<i>(loud bang)</i>

18
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,511
Hello?

19
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,511
Who's there?

20
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,109
I said "Who's there?"

21
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,751
<i>(gasps)</i>

22
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,311
Donnie...

23
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,952
What the hell are you
doing here this late?

24
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,352
- Working.
- Working... at this hour(?)

25
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,388
What is this?

26
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,034
What the hell were you doing?

27
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,228
Get out of here.

28
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,111
You freak!

29
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,198
Get out of here! And don't come back.

30
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,837
I should report you!
Just go on. Get out of here!

31
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,589
I got the call from Minneapolis PD...

32
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,592
...saying they wanted the FBI
to come out and take a look.

33
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,196
Anything slightly freakazoid,
that's the drill. Call Moe Bocks.

34
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,317
As if I'm tight
with all the nutcases in town!

35
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,676
So I shoot on down here
to see what's the what.

36
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,435
And I'll be damned if I'm not knocked
on my butt by what they show me.

37
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,432
22 years I've never seen anything like it!

38
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,229
I get one look at the corpse and I'm
on the phone to my pal Andy Schneider...

39
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,790
...down at the Mutual UFO Network.
You know Andy?

40
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,394
- No, I don't.
- Well, he knows you.

41
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,759
- <i>(Mulder)</i> Why'd you call MUFON?
- To see if there was UFO activity in the area.

42
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,593
You think this grave
was unearthed by aliens?

43
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,558
Well, it has all the telltale signs,
don't you think?

44
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,757
- I mean, according to the literature.
- Literature?

45
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,274
You know the way
the hair and nails are cut away?

46
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,796
Sorta like they do in cattle mutilations.

47
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,228
I hate to disappoint you, Agent Bocks...

48
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,199
...but it doesn't look like the work of aliens.
- No? How can you be sure?

49
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,078
I've seen this kind of thing
before at Violent Crimes.

50
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,913
Whoever dug this up
probably used a backhoe.

51
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,199
If you check the ground, you'll probably
find new tracks leading to a garage nearby.

52
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,794
- You think?
- He may work here, but it's unlikely.

53
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,952
He's probably worked at a mortuary
or cemetery at some time.

54
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,918
Probably been busted,
but you won't find any record.

55
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,390
It has to be bad for business
when those kind of stories get around.

56
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,392
You're saying
some human's been doing this?

57
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,914
Yeah, if you wanna call him that.

58
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,070
- You OK, Scully?
- Yeah.

59
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,948
I've read about cases of desecrating
the dead, but never seen it.

60
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,157
Nothing can prepare you for it.
It's almost unimaginable.

61
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,791
- Why do they do it?
- Well, people collect salt and pepper shakers.

62
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,237
Fetishists collect dead things - fingernails
and hair. No one quite knows why.

63
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,474
Though I've never really understood
salt and pepper shakers myself.

64
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,188
- Sometimes you surprise me, Mulder.
- Why's that?

65
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,510
How that didn't shock you back there.

66
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,434
I'd prepared myself for it
before we left Washington.

67
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,559
You knew this wasn't UFO related
from the start?

68
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,995
I'd suspected as much, yeah.

69
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,868
It took us three hours to get here.
Our plane doesn't leave until tomorrow.

70
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,952
- If you suspected...
- Vikings versus Redskins, Scully.

71
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,157
40-yard line
in the Hubert H Humphrey Metrodome.

72
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,435
You and me.

73
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,837
<i>(woman)</i> Have you lived in
the Twin Cities area long, Mr Pfaster?

74
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,435
I grew up here. I was away for a few years.

75
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,917
Oh... What kind of work
were you in before?

76
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,753
Cosmetology. Hair and make-up.

77
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,194
Oh... It's interesting.

78
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,555
If you don't mind my saying,
that's a lovely colour lipstick you're wearing.

79
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,631
Is that Indian Summer?

80
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,796
Yes... Yes, it is.

81
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,468
You're applying for the job
as the delivery man?

82
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,075
To put myself through school.
I've gone back to school.

83
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,151
Oh. And what are you studying?

84
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,754
- Comparative religions.
- Oh.

85
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,716
- Are you a religious person yourself?
- Yes. Very.

86
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,638
I shouldn't say this, but Mr Ficicello feels
very strongly about religious backgrounds.

87
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,599
He prides himself
on the honesty of his employees.

88
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,240
Can you put that on the application?

89
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,551
- I'll attach a little note.
- Thank you.

90
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,115
<i>Long, long pass.</i>
<i>Here's Garner with the catch.</i>

91
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,513
<i>And Garner brought down at the Washington</i>
<i>five-yard line for a Viking first down.</i>

92
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,911
Sorry you had to miss your game,
but we've found more bodies dug up.

93
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,278
Did you get your Forensics report
on the first one yet?

94
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,510
There was somebody down in the grave.

95
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,912
Cut the hair with a pair of pinking shears.
Gotta wonder about this guy!

96
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,992
Well, at least he wasn't down there
with his blow-dryer.

97
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,152
- How many bodies does that make?
- Three in the last two days.

98
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,913
What else can you tell me about the corpses?

99
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,072
The hair was cut from the heads
of two of the bodies.

100
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,799
From the third,
the fingernails were pulled out...

101
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,668
...with what looks like
a pair of needle-nosed pliers.

102
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,398
I want you to draft
an eyes-only memo to everyone here...

103
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,517
...and to all law enforcement
agencies in the area.

104
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,794
Saying what?

105
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,953
That the Twin Cities may have a...
escalating fetishist on their hands.

106
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,032
- A what?
- An escalating fetishist.

107
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,556
Security should be tightened
around cemeteries and funeral homes.

108
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,676
Hospitals should be notified.

109
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,038
A story should be issued to the press
warning of a possible stalker in the area.

110
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,714
This isn't New York, Agent Mulder.

111
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,076
People keep their doors unlocked here.
This is gonna scare 'em.

112
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,550
Well, leave out the more gruesome aspects
in your press release.

113
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,076
Why do you want to alarm folks
if this guy only preys on dead people?

114
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,472
Because his compulsion is growing. He may
resort to homicide to procure his corpses.

115
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,350
Once he gets the taste of a warm body,
he's probably gonna want more.

116
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,193
Maybe I've been isolated up here
in the great white North too long.

117
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,436
What do you mean?

118
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,798
People wondered why it took them so long
to catch this kid in Milwaukee.

119
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,749
Thought someone should've noticed
he was killing all those young boys.

120
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,355
Truth is... no one ever believed
it could happen.

121
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,070
If you catch this guy first,
maybe they can go on believing that.

122
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,711
We don't have the manpower or expertise
to move on this with any speed.

123
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,519
It's gonna be hard to round up anybody
on a Saturday.

124
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,196
It could be Monday or Tuesday
before we get our ducks in a row.

125
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,511
We have some work to do here.
I'm gonna cancel our flight out.

126
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,668
- Scully?
- I'll be right there.

127
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,473
<i>(Scully) A complete model or psychological</i>
<i>profile of the death fetishist does not exist.</i>

128
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,519
<i>The compulsion is a result</i>
<i>of a complex misplacement of values...</i>

129
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,673
<i>... and a deviation from</i>
<i>cultural norms and social mores.</i>

130
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,788
<i>He is more likely to be white, male, and</i>
<i>of average to above-average intelligence.</i>

131
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,158
<i>Cases of fetishists with IQs over 150</i>
<i>have been documented.</i>

132
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,390
<i>The progression of the pathology</i>
<i>moves from the fantasy stage...</i>

133
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,396
<i>... to the eventual acting out of fetishistic</i>
<i>impulses, including opportunistic homicide.</i>

134
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,032
<i>Agent Mulder believes that the suspect</i>
<i>in this case is escalating towards this action.</i>

135
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,989
<i>Once he begins to murder, the killing</i>
<i>draws attention away from a deeper motive.</i>

136
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,234
<i>A motive which most people, including law</i>
<i>enforcement professionals, dare not imagine.</i>

137
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,917
<i>It is somehow easier to believe,</i>
<i>as Agent Bocks does, in aliens and UFOs...</i>

138
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,834
<i>... than in the kind of inhuman monster</i>
<i>who could prey on the living...</i>

139
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,751
<i>... to scavenge from the dead.</i>

140
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,871
Hi.

141
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,916
Hello there!

142
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,629
- Hi.
- Hi.

143
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,635
Are you looking for a date?

144
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,558
Yes.

145
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,473
Why don't you pull up
around the corner over there?

146
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,235
Well, actually, I was thinking
of a couple of hours.

147
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,829
Where do you have in mind?

148
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,555
Don't you have any heat in here?
It's freezing.

149
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,272
The forced-air unit is broken.

150
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,749
I'd like to run you a bath.

151
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,995
Is your hair treated?

152
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,111
What?

153
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,479
Do you need a shampoo
for chemically treated hair?

154
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,915
You want me to shampoo my hair?

155
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,118
I'll pay extra if that's
something out of the ordinary.

156
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,194
Well, nobody's ever asked me.

157
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,031
<i>(phone rings)</i>

158
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,431
Excuse me.

159
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,436
Hello?

160
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,353
- <i>Is this Mr Pfaster?</i>
- Yes.

161
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,560

<i>We'd like you to start right away.</i>

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,599
Hey, what's going on here?
The water is ice-cold.

164
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,835
What kind of sick freak are you?

165
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,074
Oh, my God!

166
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,438
- <i>Mr Pfaster?</i>
- Yes. That's wonderful news.

167
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,672
Thank you so much.

168
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,069
Don't you come near me.

169
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,151
I mean it.

170
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,190
Don't you touch me!

171
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,589
Stay away from me!

172
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,558
Keep away from me!
Don't you come near me.

173
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,829
<i>(screams)</i>

174
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,077
<i>(Bocks)</i> We're still waiting
for someone to ID the body.

175
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,517
Judging from the area,
I'd say she's probably a working girl.

176
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,311
Watch your step.

177
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,311
No...

178
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,391
Oh, my God!

179
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,071
Oh, my God!

180
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,671
Who did this to her?

181
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,833
- Was it him?
- Looks like it.

182
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,869
Knife wound the length of the torso.
Cut all her hair off. Took her fingernails.

183
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,633
This time he took some fingers, too.

184
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,915
- Wanna see the body?
- Yeah.

185
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,915
I need a minute.

186
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,595
Hey! Let him take a look.

187
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,709
Hi. I'm your new delivery man.

188
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,674
Oh, hi. Come in.

189
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,759
Did they give you Skip's old route?

190
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,675
Yes, I think so.
I've just started with the company.

191
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,038
Skip's been delivering to us so long,
we took it for granted he'd always be around.

192
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,395
Since before the kids were born.

193
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,149
Lisa, this is, uh...

194
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,189
Donnie. Donnie Pfaster.

195
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,472
- He's taking over for Skip.
- Oh, hi.

196
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,075
- I'm gonna go over to Steve's now, OK?
- OK. You have a good time.

197
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,151
- Bye.
- Bye.

198
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,389
We have three daughters.

199
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,871
Oh.

200
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,551
Pardon me. May I use your washroom
to wash up my hands?

201
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,870
Sure. There's a washroom just off the porch.

202
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,551
I just wanted to tell you, if we're ever not
home, we always leave the back door open.

203
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,519
Oh. Thank you. I'll remember that.

204
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,280
<i>(Scully) Death is a recorded event...</i>

205
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,954
<i>... for reasons natural or unnatural.</i>

206
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,909
<i>When a body ceases to function, the cause</i>
<i>of the effect can be clearly reconstructed.</i>

207
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,389
<i>A body has a story to tell.</i>

208
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,388
The time is 11.14am, Monday November 14th.

209
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,557
The deceased is a female in her twenties.

210
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,796
<i>If the victim was strangled, an examination</i>
<i>of the veins in the eyes will reveal this.</i>

211
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,111
<i>If shot, entry wounds</i>
<i>and gunpowder residue can be used...</i>

212
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,069
<i>... to reconstruct the events leading to death</i>
<i>and help to establish a possible motive.</i>

213
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,836
<i>Hair and fibres, slivers of glass,</i>
<i>plastic, even insect casings...</i>

214
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,311
<i>... can serve to recreate the circumstances</i>
<i>under which death occurred.</i>

215
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,679
<i>It may be an irony only understood by those</i>
<i>of us who conduct these examinations...</i>

216
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,709
<i>... that death, like life itself, is a drama</i>
<i>with a beginning, middle and end.</i>

217
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,872
<i>It is my opinion,</i>
<i>having conducted this examination...</i>

218
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:44,115
<i>... that the victim died a wrongful death for the</i>
<i>purpose of extracting her hair and fingernails.</i>

219
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,714
<i>The time of death</i>
<i>cannot be accurately judged...</i>

220
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:52,033
<i>... due, I believe, to immersion in</i>
<i>a cold environment, most likely water.</i>

221
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,475
<i>For the record, it is my opinion that...</i>

222
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,633
<i>... outside of child homicide,</i>
<i>which may be more tragic...</i>

223
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,554
<i>... this is one of the most angry</i>
<i>and dehumanising murders imaginable.</i>

224
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,437
Mm-mm, I just don't know.

225
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,909
Look at each man carefully.

226
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,588
He's none of those guys. He was ordinary.
He didn't look like no freak.

227
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:18,117
Do you remember what kind of car
he was driving, what colour it was?

228
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,430
I think it was white.

229
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,913
OK, you can go. Just leave a number
and address where you can be reached.

230
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,116
- You gonna catch this guy?
- We'll catch him.

231
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,239
Might be a good week to take
that paid vacation the boss owes you.

232
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,515
Yeah. Right(!)

233
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,234
If this guy looks regular and doesn't have a
record, he's gonna be near impossible to find.

234
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,596
Until he kills again, or until
we can determine what drives him.

235
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:50,879
I read your profile. Sounds like he can't make
it with women. It would explain the hooker.

236
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,316
The hooker was just convenient.
He's after trophies.

237
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,552
His victim was a young, attractive woman.
The corpses he dug up were young women.

238
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,475
What's fuelling his need? What's important
about the hair and fingernails to him?

239
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,314
It's as if it's not enough that they're dead,
he's also gotta defile them.

240
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,391
There's a deeper psychosis here.

241
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,076
It's an unfathomable hatred of women,
probably going back to his mother.

242
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,072
I'd say she's pretty fried at him, too.

243
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,516
I think we should call
all the psychiatric facilities in the area...

244
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,831
...and ask if they have any patients
with similar pathologies.

245
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,755
This kind of a monster isn't made overnight.
He's been developing this fetish for years.

246
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:34,711
The necessity of the story - myth -
in a culture is almost universal.

247
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,476
We think of myths as things
that entertain or instruct.

248
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,996
But their deeper purpose
is often to explain, or make fanciful...

249
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:51,710
...desires, wishes or behaviour that society
would otherwise deem unacceptable.

250
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,634
Because they are conveyed
in a wrapping of untruth - the story -

251
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,756
these thoughts become harmless.

252
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,196
Take, for example, the stories
we recite to our children.

253
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,271
<i>Snow White, Alice in Wonderland...</i>

254
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,319
The subtextual themes,
when the Queen orders "Off with her head!"...

255
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,517
...or the Prince awakens
Sleeping Beauty with a kiss...

256
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,275
...are what Freud would describe
as death-wish imaginings.

257
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,793
<i>(clears throat)</i>

258
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,156
Excuse me. I'm in your mythology class.

259
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,595
- Uh-huh?
- My name's Donnie.

260
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,832
I sit a couple of rows over.
Maybe you've seen me.

261
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,508
- Uh, I don't know. I...
- I know. You sit up front.

262
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,791
I just...

263
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,274
See, I... I was going to my car
and I saw you... and...

264
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,837
Did he ask us to read
chapters 10 and 11, or 11 and 12?

265
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,794
Oh... I... uh, I think it was, uh...

266
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,556
- It was chapters 10 and 11.
- Oh, thanks.

267
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,316
I have to go now.

268
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,039
- Don't go.
- Let go of the door.

269
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,994
Help! Someone! Help!

270
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,588
- <i>(phone rings)</i>
- <i>(Scully gasps)</i>

271
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,392
- Hello?
- <i>(Mulder) It's me.</i>

272
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,234
<i>They've arrested somebody</i>
<i>they think may be our guy.</i>

273
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,755
I'll get dressed.

274
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,476
He's got a history of assault.

275
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,870
911 call came in from a security officer
who saw it happen.

276
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,349
She hurt him pretty bad.

277
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,509
Yeah, he's definitely our guy.

278
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,634
- Who cut him?
- A working girl.

279
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,508
They're all carrying knives
since what happened.

280
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,750
I'm Agent Mulder.
Have you been read your rights?

281
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,593
I paid her the money,
then she hauls out this knife.

282
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,355
What am I supposed to do?
I smacked her a couple of times.

283
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,079
Self-defence. Self-defence...

284
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,595
- He's not our guy.
- I thought we had him.

285
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,875
We're back to square one.

286
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,193
Mulder, can I have a minute with you?

287
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,995
I'll wait out front.

288
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,153
I might better drive this investigation
if I could focus on the evidence.

289
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,516
- What do you suggest?
- That I take the body back to Washington.

290
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,592
I could run it through
the fingerprint lab. Those guys...

291
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,958
Scully, if you're having trouble
with this case, I want you to tell me.

292
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,270
- I'm not, Mulder.
- I'd understand.

293
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,148
- I mean, it's not exactly easy to stomach.
- I'm fine.

294
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,755
Really... I just think we're a long way
from catching this guy.

295
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,233
If we could get a print, we'd have something
to focus on. Right now we're at a standstill.

296
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,312
I think it's a good idea.

297
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,393
I just don't want you to think
you have to hide anything from me.

298
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,032
I've seen agents with 20 years' field
experience fall apart on cases like this.

299
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,680
I'm fine. I can handle it.

300
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,791
Hey...

301
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,040
What's your name?

302
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,509
- You talking to me?
- Yeah.

303
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,949
Were those FBI agents?

304
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,191
Yeah.

305
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,354
What were they asking you?

306
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,869
They thought I was some freak
who's been diggin' up corpses!

307
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,520
Man, I'm in enough trouble already.

308
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,869
What were their names?

309
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,193
- Who?
- The younger agents.

310
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,231
Oh...

311
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,155
Uh, I don't remember his name.

312
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,677
She was Scully.
Like that baseball announcer.

313
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,079
Let's go, Mr Pfaster.

314
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,470
- Go where?
- Lady's dropped the charges against you.

315
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:30,429
They're letting you out as soon as
you talk to a psychiatric social worker.

316
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,910
At first glance, there's not much to work with.
Satin doesn't hold a print real well.

317
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,309
There may be a latent in these blood stains.

318
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,994
I suspect the killer wore gloves.

319
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,393
Well, the body was on my flight,
so it should be here soon.

320
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,552
We'll take a look. How long
are you in town, Agent Scully?

321
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,997
I have a flight back to Minneapolis
booked for tonight, but, um... I might cancel.

322
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,389
I've put all other work aside.

323
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,072
Thanks.

324
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,554
You think that you find a way
to deal with these things.

325
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,990
In med school you develop
a clinical detachment to death.

326
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,789
In your FBI training
you are confronted with cases...

327
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,031
...the most violent and terrible cases.

328
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,350
You think you can look
into the face of pure evil...

329
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,196
...and then you find yourself paralysed by it.

330
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,233
Are you aware that you've been talking
about yourself in the second person?

331
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,834
No. Was I?

332
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,029
Do you know why?

333
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,111
Um...

334
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,716
Probably as another way
of trying to detach myself from it.

335
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,678
You're a very strong person.

336
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,550
You've probably always felt
you can handle any problem by yourself.

337
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,915
But you feel vulnerable now.

338
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,389
Do you know why that is?

339
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,595
No.

340
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,918
Is it your partner?
Is there a problem with trust?

341
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,991
No.

342
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,274
I trust him as much as anyone.

343
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,353
I trust him with my life.

344
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,228
Can you talk to him about
the way you're feeling?

345
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,719
I don't want him to know
how much this is bothering me.

346
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,751
No.

347
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,628
I don't want him to feel
like he has to protect me.

348
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,473
I know you lost your father last year.

349
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,230
And, uh... I read in your file
that you were very ill recently...

350
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,914
...that your life was threatened.

351
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,353
These exposures can leave you
extremely vulnerable.

352
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,113
I know these things.

353
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,589
I'm... conscious of them.

354
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,193
I know that the world is full of predators,
just as it has always been.

355
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:37,319
And I know that it is my job
to protect people from them.

356
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,871
And I have counted on that fact
to give me faith in my ability to do what I do.

357
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,109
I want that faith back.

358
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,955
I need it back.

359
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,713
That's great.

360
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,268
- Ah! I've been looking for you.
- I had a meeting.

361
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,670
- I got good news.
- What did you find?

362
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,594
There was nothing on the sheets.
But we pulled something off the body.

363
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,240
The guy cut her fingers off,
but not all of them.

364
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,470
On her right hand, he left a thumb.

365
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,949
I pulled this off the nail polish.

366
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:23,556
There must've been a struggle before
he killed her - before he put the gloves on.

367
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,154
- I'll call Agent Mulder.
- Somebody called for you.

368
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,151
- Who?
- Said he was an agent in Minneapolis.

369
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,549
I said you had a flight booked back tonight.

370
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,189
- Was it Agent Mulder?
- I didn't recognise the name.

371
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,273
- Did you tell him about the print?
- I hadn't found it yet.

372
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,509
- <i>Mulder.</i>
- Hi, it's me.

373
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,752
We got a print.

374
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,513
- Scully got a print.
- Fantastic!

375
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,160
I'll modem it out to you
to see if you can run a match.

376
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,552
- <i>Are you staying on there, Scully?</i>
- No. I'm coming back tonight.

377
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:59,550
- Look, I know this is a horrific case, but if...
- I'm OK with it, Mulder.

378
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,473
- Anyway, you could use my help.
- Always.

379
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,757
You or Agent Bocks didn't call
here for me earlier, did you?

380
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,831
Did you call Scully?

381
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,876
No.

382
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,872
- OK. I'll see you when I get there.
- <i>All right.</i>

383
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,670
- FBI!
- I'll take the bedroom!

384
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,799
Move it! Move it! Move it!

385
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,871
- <i>Team two, go!</i>
- Go!

386
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,758
- <i>Team one, what is your status?</i>
- We're clear back here!

387
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,831
Clear!

388
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,513
Bill! I think it's human hair.

389
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,112
Suspect does not appear to be at home.

390
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,478
Let's put out an APB
on Donald Addie Pfaster, age 28.

391
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,630
Moe, take a look at this.

392
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,358
- She should be here.
- She was on the plane.

393
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,829
It landed three hours ago.

394
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,794
We found Agent Scully's car.

395
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,276
She was forced off the road. A white car.

396
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,238
Get a sample of this paint
on a plane to Washington.

397
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,474
If we're lucky, we can get a make and model
of the car by morning. We're gonna find her.

398
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,151
<i>(siren)</i>

399
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,351
<i>(water running)</i>

400
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,359
Nothing registered to Donald Pfaster?

401
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,635
Right. Right, got it.

402
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,111
The paint is called Ivory Bone.

403
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,796
It's a two-step enamel used by
three makers of late-model mid-size cars.

404
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,479
They estimate there may be 60,000 cars that
fit that description in the metropolitan area.

405
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,073
- Nothing?
- <i>No.</i>

406
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,152
No one saw her leave the rental agency?
No attendant?

407
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,549
<i>Sorry, Mulder, that's all we got.</i>

408
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,279
People videotape police beatings
on dark streets.

409
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,272
They spot Elvis in three cities
across America every day.

410
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,636
But no one saw a pretty woman
being forced off the road.

411
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,792
He could've taken her anyplace.
How are we gonna find her?

412
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,190
Well, um... We gotta start at the beginning.

413
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,590
As nasty as it might sound,
we gotta get inside this guy's head.

414
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,240
Where would he go?

415
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,472
- Anywhere but his mother's, right?
- Why do you say that?

416
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,078
Being he's so pissed off at her,
from what your profile says.

417
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,317
- Do we know where his mother lives?
- I don't know.

418
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,594
Let's find out.

419
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,636
The mother lives in Boca Raton, Florida.

420
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,032
Correction. She used to live there.
She died a year ago.

421
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,640
Did she have a car registered to her?

422
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,915
Late-model white sedan.

423
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,475
He inherited the car.

424
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:33,435
Maybe Boca Raton was a winter house.
Does she have a residence in Minneapolis?

425
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,636

Don't be afraid.

00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,669
Is your hair normal or dry?

429
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,638
Where are you going?

430
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,676
There's no way out, girlie girl!

431
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,829
I know this house, girlie girl.

432
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,595
There's nowhere to hide.

Federal agent! Hands in the air!
Hands in the air!

437
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,560
Can we get some paramedics here now!

438
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,789
Just help me get my wrists untied.

439
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,119
- How did you find me?
- His mother owned the house.

440
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,273
Willed it to his sisters.
A patrolman saw his car out back.

441
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,751
Get him outta here.

442
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,314
Sure you don't wanna sit down, Scully?

00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,470
