1
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:05,927
- T-minus ten seconds to engagement.

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,066
Yaaah!
Whoo-hoo!

3
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:11,940
Whoo!
Lo-Fat's goin'off!

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,106
- Gotta kill! Gotta kill.
- Stay out of my way, geeks.

5
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,479
Come the next level,
I'm a death machine.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,609
Whoo! Yeah!

7
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,956
Status: combat ready.

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,893
Situation: Guerrilla units
in the immediate vicinity...

9
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,759
of insertion module.

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,461
Whoo! Yeah!

11
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,473
- Let's do this!
- Bring it on!

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,736
- T-minus ten, nine,
- Look at these heart rates.

13
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,439
- Eight, seven, six,
- If I don't let these boys out,
they're gonna kill each other.

14
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,449
- Five, four,
- Come on! Yeah!

15
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,985
three, two,

16
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,987
one.

17
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,989
- Engage.
- Whoo!

18
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,173
Do you see 'em?

19
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,607
They're out there, geeks,
looking to fry your huevos.

20
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,856
Call it, Retro!
Call it!

21
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,457
Now!

22
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:13,860
Whoa! It's a total
massacre out there.

23
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:26,211
Phase two, geeks.

24
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,384
- Ready, knuckleheads?
- Flank right!

25
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,014
- Flank left!
- Go!

26
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,115
Lo-Fat's down.

27
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,963
- You got me, Moxie?
- Got you covered.

28
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:01,131
- Retro's in.
- Adrenaline redline.

29
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:03,539
The blood thirst
is unquenchable.

30
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,606
Moxie? Who's there?

31
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,910
Who are you?

32
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,421
I am Maitreya.
This is my game.

33
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,309
Agents Mulder and Scully.
F.B.I. We're expected.

34
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:29,684
I need to scan your I.D.

35
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:35,525
Retina scan, please.

36
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:40,256
Cool.

37
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:42,596
Ma'am?

38
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:46,263
I'll need you to look over
those nondisclosure agreements.

39
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,472
"To protect all proprietary
or intellectual property...

40
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:52,942
"owned by FPS, a private
California corporation,

41
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:55,036
under the harshest penalty
of the law."

42
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:57,707
Signature at the bottom,
please.

43
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,823
- FPS.
- First Person Shooter.

44
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:11,688
- Video games.
- Digital entertainment.

45
00:07:11,763 --> 00:07:15,358
I can get into the Pentagon
easier than this.

46
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:19,234
Dudes! Agent Mulder,
what's up, wild man?

47
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:22,034
Welcome to the land
where silicon meets silicone.

48
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:25,804
Can I get you a latte from the bar,
or perhaps a bottle of designer H2O?

49
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:28,175
Scully?

50
00:07:28,246 --> 00:07:30,476
How 'bout a simple explanation
as to why we're here?

51
00:07:30,549 --> 00:07:34,747
Why don't we take a brief moment to feel
the pulse of the new American gold rush?

52
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,914
You're standing on the launch pad
of a rocket headed for the stars.

53
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:41,325
Okay.

54
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,929
There's been
a little accident.

55
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,434
What kind of accident?

56
00:07:50,502 --> 00:07:52,732
Like an industrial accident.

57
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:56,262
- How did the victim die?
- It's not exactly clear.

58
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:58,434
- Right.
- Was there equipment involved?

59
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,444
- No.
- Yes.

60
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:03,538
- Yes and no.
- What's your business here?

61
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:05,708
- Our business?
- Yeah.

62
00:08:05,784 --> 00:08:07,911
We're... We're
consultants to FPS.

63
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:10,887
Langly did some
programming for them.

64
00:08:10,956 --> 00:08:14,153
- He created all of the bad guys.
- Only the Euro-goons.

65
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:17,684
We don't want to give you the idea
that we're major profit participants.

66
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:20,231
Cash or stock options?

67
00:08:20,298 --> 00:08:23,096
Options.
Preferred rate.

68
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:26,103
Vested immediately with a short-term
exercise against venture collateral...

69
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:28,105
to bypass S.E.C. regs.

70
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:30,733
- The I.P.O. 's in a week.
- Game ships on Friday.

71
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:33,209
Fifty malls across
the United States and Japan.

72
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,475
Only there's a dead body
between you and untold riches.

73
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:40,712
I don't know about you guys,
but I'd be checking my shorts for cake.

74
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:49,858
- This man's been shot.
- No!

75
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:53,329
See, when somebody is shot,
there's a gun involved, right?

76
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:58,165
That is absolutely impossible
because there's no way anybody
could get a gun past security.

77
00:08:58,236 --> 00:09:00,500
What do you call this?

78
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:03,973
That's a laser blaster
for wasting cyber-trash.

79
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:06,636
- It emits a low-frequency...
- Just let me! All right.

80
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,840
The weapons feed off
the FPS mainframe.

81
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:12,850
The effect is intensely real,
but harmless.

82
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:16,718
You say this weapon is a toy, but
this man clearly has gunshot wounds...

83
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:18,847
- Through his...
- Stun suit.

84
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:21,620
It's rigged with paint
for wounds and kill shots.

85
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:24,389
Total bleeding-edge
technology.

86
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:31,761
- He's dead. I got it.
- Who was he playing against?

87
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:36,171
Against the game. You waste
the cyber-thugs before they waste you.

88
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:38,175
It's all about body count.

89
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:41,041
But they're
computer-generated images...

90
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,013
running on a projector.

91
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:45,242
It all happens
in the game space.

92
00:09:45,317 --> 00:09:47,581
It's a total
digital environment.

93
00:09:47,652 --> 00:09:49,847
Nothing's real.
It's all virtual.

94
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:52,355
Did anybody see
what happened?

95
00:09:53,992 --> 00:09:56,688
I was in the control booth
with Ivan.

96
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,289
Retro was in the zone.
His telemetry was solid.

97
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:03,801
He looked unstoppable, like
he was on his way to the next level,

98
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,996
when suddenly
he was cooked meat.

99
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:09,336
Well, the next call's
gonna be to the local P.D.

100
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:12,934
No cops! No cops.
You said no cops.

101
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:15,172
You said
you had connections.

102
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,511
Connections or not,
you've got a murder victim here.

103
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:19,516
Headlines!

104
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:21,953
Just what the Wall Street money dudes
want to read as we're goin' to market.

105
00:10:21,953 --> 00:10:23,682
Just what the Wall Street money dudes
want to read as we're goin' to market.

106
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:26,383
Yes, this is Special Agent
Dana Scully with the F.B.I.

107
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,360
You said you were in
the control booth when it happened?

108
00:10:30,428 --> 00:10:34,364
Can you tell me
exactly what you saw?

109
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:36,866
-  I'm still
not sure if we even saw it.

110
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:41,031
I mean, one minute everything
was going perfect, and then we crashed.

111
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:44,803
Ivan and I were sitting here.
We both just looked at each other.

112
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:49,040
It happened so fast.

113
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:54,713
Moxie's covering Retro, who's
going inside after the enemy
to rack up beaucoup points.

114
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:58,847
And then "goosh," Retro's
vitals spike like he's been shot.

115
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,789
And the system defaults.

116
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:03,760
And they're
right back in the game space.

117
00:11:05,597 --> 00:11:08,760
Lo-Fat, get over here!
What happened?

118
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:11,935
Retro?
What's wrong?

119
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:14,938
- Lights out. Game over.
- What's wrong, man? What happened?

120
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:17,065
What happened in there?

121
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:20,600
We don't know. There's no
res images on interior game spaces.

122
00:11:22,113 --> 00:11:24,775
What about
the wire frame?

123
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,715
Maybe I can.

124
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:29,117
I'll strip down
to wire frame display.

125
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:33,419
Um, I mean...
we've never mapped this area before.

126
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:36,688
Retro was in noncombat space.

127
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,135
- It's a chick.
- It can't be.

128
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:57,007
Can you texture-wrap her?

129
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:24,965
- Holy Toledo!
- She's packin' a flintlock.

130
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:28,444
That ain't all she's packin'.
Can you print that out for me?

131
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:46,129
Goddess.

132
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:50,626
Let me get this straight,
Agent Scully.

133
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:53,364
You got no murder weapon,
no forensic evidence,

134
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:56,100
no motive,
no suspect.

135
00:12:56,174 --> 00:12:58,108
Scully.

136
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:01,202
My partner Agent Mulder.
This is Detective Lacoeur.

137
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,646
- Have you got something?
- Yeah, our killer, I believe.

138
00:13:07,118 --> 00:13:11,214
Hey, I'll put out an A.P.B.
for Frederick's of Hollywood.

139
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:13,314
Mulder,
you're not serious.

140
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:15,655
It's all in the computer.

141
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:18,855
Mulder, that's any voluptuous vixen
out of any number of video games.

142
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,559
She's not in "any video game." She's in
this one, and no one programmed her in.

143
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:25,831
Yeah, but even if they had,
she's not real.

144
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:29,965
She's a character. She's-She's
some immature, hormonal fantasy.

145
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:37,880
Darryl Musashi.
You see who that is?

146
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:42,010
- Darryl Musashi.
- As I live and breathe.

147
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:45,454
- Who's Darryl Musashi?
- The O.G.

148
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:47,457
Original Guru.

149
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:50,961
Word is he slums as a game designer
when he's not contracted to the C.I.A.

150
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:54,226
- The boy wonder of virtual mayhem.
- What's he doing here?

151
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:57,666
Ivan must have called him
to go in and slay the ninja babe.

152
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,637
Mulder, why does this game
have the effect...

153
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:03,265
of reducing grown men
back to moony adolescence?

154
00:14:04,642 --> 00:14:06,576
That's Darryl Musashi!

155
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:08,737
Mulder.

156
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:12,271
- Huh.
- Do you want me to autopsy the body?

157
00:14:19,156 --> 00:14:22,751
Emerging module
into set mode. T-minus 20 seconds.

158
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:24,760
Pay attention, worms.

159
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:27,524
Darryl Musashi's gonna show us
how this game's supposed to be played.

160
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:30,863
I heard he scored 90 consecutive wins
on Demon Space Drifter.

161
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:34,870
- Ninety-one.
- Look at him. The man's a sphinx.

162
00:14:34,938 --> 00:14:37,839
- T-minus ten,

163
00:14:37,908 --> 00:14:40,274
nine, eight,

164
00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:42,904
seven, six,

165
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,971
five, four,

166
00:14:45,048 --> 00:14:48,609
three, two, one.

167
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,754
Engage.

168
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:06,632
Hey, Byers, you gotta see this.
Mulder, get over here.

169
00:15:08,872 --> 00:15:11,898
- Is that him? Is that Darryl Musashi?
- Yeah, that's him.

170
00:15:11,975 --> 00:15:14,739
He just stepped
into the game.

171
00:15:16,213 --> 00:15:19,239
- Why is he just standing there?
- Because he knows no fear.

172
00:15:57,221 --> 00:15:59,712
- Yeah!
- Unbelievable.

173
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,884
- Standing heart rate is 68.
- He hasn't even broken a sweat.

174
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,123
Look at him. He's not
even waiting for the reset.
He's going right for the kill.

175
00:16:34,825 --> 00:16:37,419
What just happened?

176
00:16:37,494 --> 00:16:39,428
She cut off his hands.

177
00:17:20,203 --> 00:17:23,536
Preliminary external
examination of deceased,

178
00:17:24,975 --> 00:17:29,412
a 20-ish male,
name listed only as "Retro,"

179
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:33,415
offers no additional clues
as to actual cause of death.

180
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:43,859
Scratch that.

181
00:17:43,927 --> 00:17:48,523
Cause of death is from
a large entry wound at the sternum...

182
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:51,931
resulting in trauma
to the internal organs...

183
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:53,993
and blood loss.

184
00:17:54,071 --> 00:17:57,598
Wound is consistent
with a high-velocity impact...

185
00:17:57,674 --> 00:17:59,938
from a large projectile...

186
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,036
which passed through
a three-ply Kevlar jacket.

187
00:18:09,753 --> 00:18:12,221
Scratch that.

188
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:15,486
Wound is the result
of high-velocity impact...

189
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,720
from an unknown object...

190
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:20,228
which, even if it did
enter the body,

191
00:18:20,297 --> 00:18:23,232
left no damn
trace evidence whatsoever.

192
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,133
No powder burns,
no chemical signatures...

193
00:18:26,203 --> 00:18:29,195
of any kind
of explosive propellant.

194
00:18:30,507 --> 00:18:34,034
- No luck?
- I thought I was on to something.

195
00:18:35,746 --> 00:18:39,580
You know, Mulder, this suit holds
more than just exploding paint cells.

196
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:44,382
It measures the player's
vital signs, from the heart rate
to the extant body chemistry,

197
00:18:44,454 --> 00:18:46,615
and then sends that information
back to the computer.

198
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:51,389
Then when a player is shot,
a battery pack sends a 12-volt jolt...

199
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:53,793
that keeps him from getting up
until the game is over.

200
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:55,729
Virtual death.

201
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,063
Yeah. Well, if only
that were the case.

202
00:18:58,135 --> 00:19:01,730
- Yeah.
- I thought at first that maybe
the suit had malfunctioned,

203
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:04,501
that one of the charges
had blown inward.

204
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:08,601
But unfortunately,
that wasn't the case either.

205
00:19:08,678 --> 00:19:11,511
I've got a birthday
coming up.

206
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:15,244
You have to admit, though, Scully, this
is a pretty amazing piece of technology.

207
00:19:15,318 --> 00:19:19,049
- Yeah. Wasted on a stupid game.
- Stupid?

208
00:19:19,122 --> 00:19:22,285
Dressing up like
high-tech warriors...

209
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:25,556
to play a futuristic version
of cowboys and Indians.

210
00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:29,360
What kind of moron
gets his ya-yas out like that?

211
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,228
Mulder, what purpose
does this game serve...

212
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:37,501
except to add to a culture
of violence in a country
that's already out of control?

213
00:19:37,574 --> 00:19:40,509
- Who says it adds to it?
- You think that taking up weapons...

214
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:43,068
and creating gratuitous
virtual mayhem...

215
00:19:43,146 --> 00:19:45,546
has any redeeming value
whatsoever?

216
00:19:45,615 --> 00:19:50,177
That the testosterone frenzy that
it creates stops when the game does?

217
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:53,689
That's rather sexist,
isn't it?

218
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:57,090
I mean, maybe the game provides
an outlet for certain impulses,

219
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,754
that it fills a void
in our genetic makeup...

220
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,560
that the more civilizing effects
of society fail to provide for us.

221
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:07,194
That must be why men feel the great
need to blast the crap out of stuff.

222
00:20:08,472 --> 00:20:11,635
Well, testosterone frenzy
or no,

223
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,871
the only suspect we have
in this man's murder is a woman.

224
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:18,738
Yeah, I've seen it.

225
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,113
A computer-animated woman,
Mulder,

226
00:20:21,184 --> 00:20:23,482
with a computer-animated
weapon.

227
00:20:23,553 --> 00:20:26,317
A flintlock pistol, which would
leave a very large entry wound.

228
00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:29,790
Pictures don't kill people.
Guns kill people.

229
00:20:31,761 --> 00:20:33,422
As do swords.

230
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:43,263
The world-renowned
Darryl Musashi.

231
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:54,483
Mulder.

232
00:20:56,086 --> 00:20:58,418
You're kidding.

233
00:21:00,156 --> 00:21:03,353
- Thanks.

234
00:21:03,426 --> 00:21:07,362
L.A. Sheriff s Department just picked
up a female suspect for the murders.

235
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:29,116
Who's the man?
He's the man.

236
00:21:29,185 --> 00:21:31,449
He's the man
with the badge!

237
00:21:31,521 --> 00:21:34,285
You get the feeling these men
have something better to do?

238
00:21:34,357 --> 00:21:36,450
I mean, is that legal?

239
00:21:36,526 --> 00:21:39,017
Uh, we picked her up
outside of a strip club in Reseda.

240
00:21:39,095 --> 00:21:41,029
Fits your description
to a "T."

241
00:21:41,097 --> 00:21:43,998
- Was she read her rights?
- About 500 times.

242
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:47,059
- Oh, yeah.

243
00:22:01,918 --> 00:22:04,219
For the record, can you
state your name, please?

244
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:05,151
For the record, can you
state your name, please?

245
00:22:10,225 --> 00:22:14,423
For the record again, my name is
Jade Blue Afterglow. I reside...

246
00:22:14,495 --> 00:22:18,488
- I'm sorry. Your real name?
- That is my real name.

247
00:22:18,566 --> 00:22:20,830
What were you expecting?
Mildred?

248
00:22:20,902 --> 00:22:23,063
No.

249
00:22:24,672 --> 00:22:27,266
I sure seem to be upsetting
a lot of people around here.

250
00:22:27,342 --> 00:22:29,833
Well, you're not
upsetting me, Miss, uh...

251
00:22:29,911 --> 00:22:31,776
Afterglow.

252
00:22:33,781 --> 00:22:36,944
I sure upset the man
running the metal detector.

253
00:22:44,492 --> 00:22:48,223
You say that you have
no knowledge of Ivan Martinez...

254
00:22:48,296 --> 00:22:52,255
or a company known
as First Person Shooter, or FPS.

255
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,699
I meet a lot of men.

256
00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:58,637
Would it surprise you to know that you
have been placed at a crime scene...

257
00:22:58,706 --> 00:23:00,799
in the offices of FPS?

258
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:04,072
Let's just say it takes
a whole lot to surprise me.

259
00:23:06,981 --> 00:23:09,779
You might want to start
telling the truth.

260
00:23:09,851 --> 00:23:12,877
And what truth
am I not telling you?

261
00:23:12,954 --> 00:23:14,888
That you murdered
two men,

262
00:23:14,956 --> 00:23:17,254
one with a 14th-century
broadsword,

263
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:19,623
and the other
with a flintlock pistol.

264
00:23:19,694 --> 00:23:23,596
Oh. You must have had me
confused with my sister.

265
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,733
Xena, warrior princess.

266
00:23:28,403 --> 00:23:31,270
Are you denying
that this is you?

267
00:23:36,844 --> 00:23:38,971
- Now I get it.
- What?

268
00:23:39,047 --> 00:23:41,481
The medical imaging place
in Culver City.

269
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:44,780
I got paid to let them
do this body-scan thing.

270
00:23:44,852 --> 00:23:47,844
They paid you
to scan your body?

271
00:23:47,922 --> 00:23:50,948
You think that's the strangest thing
I've been paid to do?

272
00:23:54,195 --> 00:23:57,631
We're very sorry,
Miss Afterglow, but...

273
00:23:57,699 --> 00:24:00,793
Uh, we're sorry.
You're free to go.

274
00:24:17,752 --> 00:24:21,244
I don't know about you, Scully,
but I am feeling the great need...

275
00:24:21,322 --> 00:24:23,688
to blast the crap
out of something.

276
00:24:41,075 --> 00:24:43,270
- Hello?
- Anybody here?

277
00:24:52,487 --> 00:24:54,455
Phoebe?

278
00:24:54,522 --> 00:24:56,456
Hey, you okay?

279
00:24:56,524 --> 00:24:59,789
Boy, I must have
fell asleep.

280
00:24:59,861 --> 00:25:02,489
I was just thinking
of taking a nap.

281
00:25:02,563 --> 00:25:06,226
I've been up for 70 hours
straight analyzing code,

282
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,291
trying to fix the game.

283
00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:12,066
- Where is everybody? Where's Ivan?
- Um, he's with the money guys.

284
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,074
They're all freaking.

285
00:25:14,142 --> 00:25:17,737
We need to talk to him right away
about a woman named Jade Blue Afterglow.

286
00:25:17,812 --> 00:25:21,612
He scanned her body and he
created the character out of her.

287
00:25:21,682 --> 00:25:23,775
- He put her in the game.
- Hey, what are they doing?

288
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:25,785
Oh.

289
00:25:26,854 --> 00:25:28,788
The Lone Gunmen
are on the floor.

290
00:25:28,856 --> 00:25:30,915
Langly and I wrote
a software patch.

291
00:25:30,992 --> 00:25:33,893
- We're going to run
a res-up test on the game.
- What for?

292
00:25:33,961 --> 00:25:35,952
To bypass the problem.

293
00:25:40,668 --> 00:25:42,397
- Hey.
- What just happened?

294
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,597
Oh, I don't know.

295
00:25:44,672 --> 00:25:48,130
- They're in the game.
- Hey, Phoebe, are you paying attention?

296
00:25:48,209 --> 00:25:50,609
You're supposed to wait
until we said we were ready.

297
00:25:50,678 --> 00:25:53,909
What the hell's going on?

298
00:25:53,981 --> 00:25:56,609
Phoebe, come on.

299
00:25:56,684 --> 00:25:59,152
- What's happening?
- Anyone up there running the program?

300
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,656
I don't believe this.
The program's running itself.

301
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:04,714
- Phoebe!
- This can't be happening.

302
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:08,228
Somebody's shooting
at them.

303
00:26:08,296 --> 00:26:12,232
This is supposed to be
background only. There wasn't
supposed to be any game play.

304
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,734
They need help.

305
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,667
Mulder!

306
00:26:25,146 --> 00:26:28,445
Nine, eight, seven,

307
00:26:28,516 --> 00:26:31,713
six, five,

308
00:26:31,786 --> 00:26:34,254
four, three,

309
00:26:34,322 --> 00:26:36,654
two, one.

310
00:26:36,724 --> 00:26:39,659
- Engage.
- Bring it on.

311
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:48,495
- You guys okay?
- We've been better.

312
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:52,266
- Byers has been hit.
- I'm okay. It's a flesh wound.

313
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,774
It's her.
She's out there.

314
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:59,437
She nailed Byers
with that flintlock.

315
00:26:59,514 --> 00:27:02,278
Okay, on the count of three,
I'm gonna lay down some cover, fellas.

316
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,648
You ready?

317
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:06,687
One,

318
00:27:06,754 --> 00:27:08,551
two, three.

319
00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:19,833
Mulder!

320
00:27:20,902 --> 00:27:23,370
Get in the module!

321
00:27:31,913 --> 00:27:35,314
- What is he doing?
- Don't go after her! Get back here!

322
00:27:35,383 --> 00:27:39,046
- He's getting his ya-yas out.
- We're not defaulting the program!

323
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,418
- Mulder!
- It's suicide!

324
00:28:03,344 --> 00:28:05,710
Put the sword down.

325
00:28:27,468 --> 00:28:29,732
Mulder?

326
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,918
- Oh, no.

327
00:28:47,054 --> 00:28:49,079
Where's Mulder?

328
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,764
I said, where's Mulder?

329
00:29:01,836 --> 00:29:04,532
Maybe you guys didn't hear me.
Come on, guys. Where is he?

330
00:29:04,605 --> 00:29:07,199
We don't know.
He just took off after her.

331
00:29:07,274 --> 00:29:10,801
- I saw what he did,
but where did he go?
- He went into the building.

332
00:29:10,878 --> 00:29:14,143
- He was firing his weapon.
- I saw where he went!

333
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:17,514
I want to know where he is.

334
00:29:17,585 --> 00:29:22,454
Is there a door or an exit or some kind
of passageway that he could have used?

335
00:29:22,523 --> 00:29:24,889
Just the one
you came in.

336
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:28,725
- He should be right here.
- It's impossible.
It's a digital environment.

337
00:29:28,796 --> 00:29:31,390
- It's just a game.
- Yeah.

338
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:34,127
- Easy for you to say.
-  Agent Scully!

339
00:29:35,236 --> 00:29:37,170
I found him.

340
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,567
This monitors everyone playing
the game. There... player four.

341
00:29:42,643 --> 00:29:45,476
- It's his telemetry.
- What do you mean?

342
00:29:45,546 --> 00:29:48,344
Player four.
That's him.

343
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,384
- On the monitor.
- Right there.

344
00:29:50,451 --> 00:29:52,646
- Where?
- That's Mulder.

345
00:29:54,121 --> 00:29:56,248
- He's alive.
- Those are his vitals.

346
00:29:56,323 --> 00:29:58,985
- He's still in the game.
- Yes, but where's the game?

347
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:44,701
Frohike!

348
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:48,203
Langly!

349
00:30:48,272 --> 00:30:50,797
Byers!

350
00:31:26,744 --> 00:31:28,678
- I think that's it.
- Yeah.

351
00:31:28,746 --> 00:31:31,442
- What are you doing?
- We're rerouting the circuitry.

352
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:34,450
- Making a kill switch
so we can shut down the game.
- Don't touch that.

353
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:37,578
I mean, it won't work.
There's no way to do that.

354
00:31:37,655 --> 00:31:42,422
We are back in business!
Baby, you are dope.

355
00:31:42,493 --> 00:31:44,256
What?

356
00:31:44,328 --> 00:31:46,956
We were toast.
I felt the flames licking my ass.

357
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:50,432
Then the bankers saw
the letters on the autopsy..."F.B.I.

358
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:53,493
Cause of death: unknown."

359
00:31:53,571 --> 00:31:57,473
You fixed our problems.
The game's gonna ship, and we're
gonna be countin'Franklins.

360
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:00,999
Yeah, and you're gonna
be countin' teeth.

361
00:32:01,078 --> 00:32:04,343
- Her partner's lost in the game.
- Lost?

362
00:32:04,415 --> 00:32:07,851
- The game has disappeared.
- What are you talking about?

363
00:32:07,918 --> 00:32:10,284
Jade Blue Afterglow.
Does that ring a bell?

364
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:14,016
Jade Blue Afterglow?

365
00:32:14,091 --> 00:32:16,616
- Oh, you'd remember her.

366
00:32:23,267 --> 00:32:25,758
Hey! Phoebe!

367
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,934
I don't know
how it happened.

368
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:36,207
You knew about her?

369
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,714
Then it was you.
You scanned that woman's body.

370
00:32:38,782 --> 00:32:40,716
Into my computer.

371
00:32:40,784 --> 00:32:43,582
She was my creation.
She was mine.

372
00:32:44,989 --> 00:32:48,186
- But why?
- You don't know what it's like...

373
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:52,252
day in and day out, choking
in a haze of rampant testosterone.

374
00:32:52,329 --> 00:32:54,923
I wouldn't be so sure.

375
00:32:54,999 --> 00:32:58,127
I mean, she was all I had
to keep me sane,

376
00:32:58,202 --> 00:33:01,968
my only way to strike back
as a woman.

377
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:06,442
She was my goddess,
everything I can never be.

378
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,944
But, Phoebe,
she is still a killer.

379
00:33:10,581 --> 00:33:13,448
I can't explain it, but she is,
and you put her in that game.

380
00:33:13,517 --> 00:33:15,508
No, I didn't.

381
00:33:15,586 --> 00:33:19,181
I was creating my own game
in my own computer.

382
00:33:19,256 --> 00:33:23,056
It was totally secret.
I never told anyone.

383
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:25,254
But somehow
she jumped programs,

384
00:33:25,329 --> 00:33:27,923
and she's feeding off
the male aggression.

385
00:33:27,998 --> 00:33:31,024
It's making her
stronger and stronger.

386
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,704
I need your help.

387
00:33:37,107 --> 00:33:40,042
You're the only one
who can understand.

388
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:44,547
- You've got to destroy her, Phoebe.
- I don't know how.

389
00:33:44,615 --> 00:33:46,549
Well, there's
got to be some way.

390
00:33:46,617 --> 00:33:50,246
There's got to be some vulnerability
or a weakness somewhere.

391
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:53,882
She has no weakness
anymore.

392
00:33:58,963 --> 00:34:00,897
Hey!

393
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:30,922
Bet you think you're gonna kick
my butt up and down the block.

394
00:34:34,665 --> 00:34:37,031
Okay.

395
00:34:41,005 --> 00:34:43,769
Her name is Maitreya.

396
00:34:43,841 --> 00:34:47,277
- Maitreya?
- She's input herself into the game.

397
00:34:47,344 --> 00:34:50,279
- We have to download her.
- We can't even get on-line.

398
00:34:50,347 --> 00:34:52,679
- The system's been hijacked.
- The program won't respond.

399
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,048
Frohike, what's wrong?

400
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,350
- What is that?
- Mulder's vitals are wiggy.

401
00:34:58,422 --> 00:35:01,016
- What?
- They're all over the map.

402
00:35:01,091 --> 00:35:04,117
This is your fault.

403
00:35:04,194 --> 00:35:08,324
- You put her here.
- Hey!

404
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:10,162
No fair pickin'
on a girl.

405
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:10,126
We're back on-line.

406
00:36:10,194 --> 00:36:12,628
- There's no picture.
- No, we're just in res-up.

407
00:36:12,696 --> 00:36:15,221
No, there's something wrong.

408
00:36:18,435 --> 00:36:21,461
- That's not the game.
- Yes, it is. It's level two.

409
00:36:21,538 --> 00:36:23,369
- How did that happen?
- Where's Mulder?

410
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,102
Mulder's in level one.

411
00:36:26,176 --> 00:36:29,703
-  No, he's right there.
- Shut the game down.

412
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,874
No, no. No, no.
I can't.

413
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,111
- Well, just turn it off.
-  Power down, Langly.

414
00:36:46,397 --> 00:36:49,093
- The computer's not responding.
- Look, we have to get him out of there!

415
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,760
Yeah, and quick.

416
00:37:03,213 --> 00:37:06,341
Whoa!
Stop right there!

417
00:37:12,956 --> 00:37:15,481
That's not really fair,
is it?

418
00:37:17,594 --> 00:37:19,858
Well, that's just cheating.

419
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:55,427
- Go, girl!
- Scully's on fire!

420
00:37:55,494 --> 00:37:58,327
- The blood thirst in unquenchable!
- Are you witnessing this?

421
00:37:58,397 --> 00:38:00,592
- Oh, yeah.
- Scully's in the zone!

422
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:02,531
- Clearly.
- What's wrong?

423
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:05,195
This is level two.
It only gets harder.

424
00:38:05,271 --> 00:38:08,536
No one's ever beaten
level two.

425
00:38:14,347 --> 00:38:16,872
- Are you okay?
- Ask me if I'm humiliated.

426
00:38:31,731 --> 00:38:33,961
Mulder.

427
00:38:50,483 --> 00:38:53,577
-  This is nuts!
- They'll never make it.

428
00:38:53,652 --> 00:38:56,815
- How do you kill something
that won't die?
- Try and stop me, Ivan.

429
00:38:56,889 --> 00:39:00,188
- My whole life is in this game!
- What are you trying to do?

430
00:39:00,259 --> 00:39:01,988
- Stay out of this!
- She's gonna destroy it.

431
00:39:02,061 --> 00:39:04,859
- It's the only way to save them.
- Let it go, both of you!

432
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:08,696
- You can save them?
- There's a kill command.

433
00:39:08,768 --> 00:39:11,032
- It kills the whole game.
- You knew about this?

434
00:39:11,103 --> 00:39:13,264
- She knew about it too.
- You said it wouldn't work.

435
00:39:13,339 --> 00:39:16,103
She was trying to save
her creation, her goddess.

436
00:39:16,175 --> 00:39:18,837
You don't care who dies
as long as your game survives.

437
00:39:18,911 --> 00:39:22,176
- Our friends are in there.
- And we're not gonna let them die.

438
00:39:46,972 --> 00:39:48,906
Mulder?

439
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:21,171
Give me that!
This is out of your hands now.

440
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,040
- Shut down the program.
- You're the only ones that can do it.

441
00:40:26,612 --> 00:40:29,809
- They can't keep this up.
- Scully's running out of ammo.

442
00:40:31,116 --> 00:40:33,812
- What's the command?
- Don't do it, Phoebe.

443
00:40:35,287 --> 00:40:37,346
We're so close.

444
00:40:53,038 --> 00:40:55,905
- The command.
- Give it to him.

445
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,305
Shift-Alt-Blood Bath.

446
00:41:27,006 --> 00:41:28,940
Oh, my God.

447
00:41:44,957 --> 00:41:48,620
We killed the game,
and Mulder and Scully along with it.

448
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:55,633
Over here!

449
00:42:03,976 --> 00:42:06,103
- Scully!
- Mulder!

450
00:42:06,178 --> 00:42:08,112
Scully!

451
00:42:19,024 --> 00:42:20,958
That's entertainment!

452
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:33,934
We came, we saw, we conquered.

453
00:42:34,006 --> 00:42:36,600
And if the taste
of victory is sweet,

454
00:42:36,675 --> 00:42:39,667
the taste of virtual victory
is not Sweet 'N Low,

455
00:42:39,745 --> 00:42:41,940
nor the bullets
made of sugar.

456
00:42:42,014 --> 00:42:45,780
Maybe out past where the imagination
ends, our true natures lie,

457
00:42:45,851 --> 00:42:48,786
waiting to be confronted
on their own terms.

458
00:42:48,854 --> 00:42:52,085
Out where the intellect is at war
with the primitive brain...

459
00:42:52,157 --> 00:42:54,955
in the hostile territory
of the digital world...

460
00:42:55,027 --> 00:42:58,963
where laws are silent and rules
disappear in the midst of arms.

461
00:42:59,031 --> 00:43:02,558
Born in anarchy,
with an unquenchable blood thirst,

462
00:43:02,635 --> 00:43:06,469
we shudder to think
what might rise up from the darkness.
