Because it is personal,

personal interest is all that I have.

- I came here looking for my son.
- Why ?

- Your father was against it too

But he came to his senses...

He was forced to. You made him do it.

<i>It changed everything.</i>

<i>We no longer cleaved</i>
<i>to any government agency.</i>

<i>We would now operate privately</i>
<i>on our own project.</i>

246
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,391
<i>That was</i>
<i>your father's objection</i>--

00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:17,054
<i>that we would ally ourselves</i>
<i>with the alien colonists.</i>

248

selfish end.

00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:25,731
- No, no, no.
You only managed to postpone it.
- We saved billions of lives.

failed to realize.

<i>be asked to make.</i>

You gave them your wife !

263
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:13,541
We sent them away, Agent Mulder,
because it was the right thing to do.

264
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,143
You sent them away
to be tested on.

265
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:19,156
We sent them so they would
come back to us. Don't you see ?

00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,228
<i>You can't think these choices</i>
<i>were made lightly.</i>

My sister wasn't taken
from any hangar.

271
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,183
She was abducted from our home
right in front of me.

272
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:57,194
Because your father was late
to understand the necessity--

273
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:02,359
that he too must give up one of
his children to the alien colonists.

274
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,368
The aliens insisted on it.

275
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:09,032
It was the only way they would give us
the one thing that we needed--

276
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:13,407
<i>the one thing without which</i>
<i>we could not proceed.</i>

277
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:20,045
<i>See, the alien fetus</i>
<i>would give us the alien genome</i>--

278
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:24,316
<i>the DNA with which we could make</i>
<i>a human hybrid.</i>

279
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,483
<i>A new race, Agent Mulder</i>--

280
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,119
<i>an alien</i>-<i>human hybrid...</i>

00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,561
<i>who could survive</i>
<i>the holocaust.</i>

282
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,065
So you could survive...

283
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,327
and live to see your sister.

284
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:55,719

00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,023
Quite.

In spite of ourselves.

287
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,528
The plan was to stall,

- to resist.
- To work secretly on a vaccine.

289
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,937

to make a vaccine...

292

Hoping that my son...

500
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,687
might live to honor me...

501
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,415
<i>[ Cocks Weapon ]</i>

502
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,514
like Bill Mulder's son.

503
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,985
<i>[ Gunshot ]</i>

504
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:20,624
<i>[ Child ]</i>
<i>I made this!</i>
