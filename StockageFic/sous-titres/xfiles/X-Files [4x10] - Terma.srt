00:34:41,393 --> 00:34:44,658
You mean
used as bio-warfare?

336
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:47,789
That's why they made
those servicemen take all them pills.

337
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:51,063
U.S. government knew
about the Black Cancer.

338
00:34:51,136 --> 00:34:55,197
They lied.
Didn't have no cure, no inoculation.

339
00:34:59,177 --> 00:35:01,111
I think we’ll quit
right there.

340
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:03,044
I got nothing more to say.

341
00:35:05,183 --> 00:35:08,812
- Let's go, Mulder.
- You said there were, uh, two devices.

342
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,854
What happened
to the other bomb?

343
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:15,621
- I ate it.
- Mulder!

344
00:35:15,693 --> 00:35:17,627
You want to know
about anarchy?

345
00:35:17,695 --> 00:35:21,859
You don't tell me where that
other bomb is, I'll make sure
you spend your prison time...

346
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:24,333
putting a big smile
on some convict's face.

347
00:35:24,402 --> 00:35:26,836
Son of a bitch stole it,
truck and all.

348
00:35:26,905 --> 00:35:29,100
- Some storage garage.
- Where?

349
00:35:29,174 --> 00:35:32,371
Terma, North Dakota.

350
00:35:32,444 --> 00:35:34,674
Thank you.

351
00:35:34,746 --> 00:35:36,680
Scully, get on the phone
and get the license numbers...

352
00:35:36,748 --> 00:35:39,376
for any two-ton trucks stolen
in North Dakota in the last six months.

353
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:41,385
Then call Canadian
border authorities...

354
00:35:41,486 --> 00:35:43,454
and have them stop any vehicle
fitting that description.

355
00:35:43,555 --> 00:35:46,023
- Tell them they're looking for a bomb.
- What are you doing?

356
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,786
This has been a big setup
from the beginning,
almost perfectly executed.

357
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,794
Someone used Krycek,
then Krycek used us.

358
00:35:50,862 --> 00:35:52,762
Someone who didn't want
that rock in American hands.

359
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:54,765
But what's in Canada?

360
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:58,860
Where would you put this rock
if you didn't want it to be found?

361
00:35:58,937 --> 00:36:00,962
Back in the ground.

362
00:36:02,507 --> 00:36:06,603
Fertilizer. Fertilizer
for my hothouse tomatoes.

363
00:36:06,678 --> 00:36:10,011
Beautiful tomatoes,
all year, eh?

364
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:12,106
Thanks.

365
00:36:48,953 --> 00:36:50,921
Go back to the refinery.

366
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:53,855
See if you can find anybody that
knows anything about that truck.

367
00:38:45,803 --> 00:38:48,397
[Alarm Beeping]

368
00:39:11,896 --> 00:39:16,833
I would just as soon kill you,
but please don't make me.

369
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:19,563
My work is done.

370
00:39:19,637 --> 00:39:21,571
[ Speaking Russian ]

371
00:39:47,065 --> 00:39:49,033
Mulder!

372
00:40:01,345 --> 00:40:04,314
- [Gavel pounds]
- I’d like to get started here.

373
00:40:04,382 --> 00:40:07,715
- Miss Scully?
- Yes, I'm ready here, sir.

374
00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:11,755
You have evidence to present.
This is what I've been told.

375
00:40:11,823 --> 00:40:14,917
Yes, sir. Uh--

376
00:40:14,992 --> 00:40:18,928
Evidence linking
a number of deaths, a great number,

377
00:40:18,996 --> 00:40:23,626
to a biotoxin that was
transported to U.S. soil...

378
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:25,965
by a courier
who was also killed.

379
00:40:26,037 --> 00:40:30,906
This was the man
who was pushed from the
Assistant Director's apartment?

380
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:34,069
Yes. He has not been I.D. 'd.

381
00:40:34,145 --> 00:40:38,047
Do we have the name
of the individual who pushed him?

382
00:40:38,149 --> 00:40:43,451
Yes, sir. Alex Krycek,
who is missing and possibly deceased.

383
00:40:43,521 --> 00:40:48,424
And are you then in possession
of the pouch or its contents?

384
00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:51,428
No, sir.

385
00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:57,958
What evidence are you then
presenting us with today?

386
00:40:58,035 --> 00:41:00,333
Documents
and interviews...

387
00:41:00,404 --> 00:41:03,305
in support of
a wide-ranging conspiracy...

388
00:41:03,374 --> 00:41:05,808
to control
a lethal biotoxin...

389
00:41:05,877 --> 00:41:09,108
that is, in fact,
extraterrestrial.

390
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,640
What are we talking about,
little green men here?

391
00:41:13,718 --> 00:41:16,482
- No, sir. Not at all.
- Why is this so hard to believe...

392
00:41:16,587 --> 00:41:19,715
when the accepted
discovery of life off this planet...

393
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:23,021
is on the front page
of every newspaper around the world?

394
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:25,562
When even the most
conservative scientists
and science journals...

395
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:28,155
are calling for the exploration
of Mars and Jupiter?

396
00:41:28,232 --> 00:41:30,598
With every reason to believe
that life and the persistence of it...

397
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:33,694
is thriving outside
our own terrestrial sphere?

398
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:36,205
If you cannot
get past this,

399
00:41:36,274 --> 00:41:41,302
then I suggest that
this whole committee
beheld in contempt...

400
00:41:41,379 --> 00:41:43,847
for ignoring evidence
that cannot be refuted.

401
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:50,712
This is not
why we are here today.

402
00:41:50,822 --> 00:41:53,382
Then why are we
here today?

403
00:41:56,027 --> 00:42:01,829
I will suggest that we recess
here until the evidence
can be properly evaluated.
