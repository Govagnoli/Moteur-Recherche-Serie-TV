1
00:00:08,722 --> 00:00:13,785
Mmm-mmm, yes. Loveyou.

2
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,157
I loveyou.

3
00:00:17,698 --> 00:00:19,757
Hello.

4
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:20,993
Good morning, sir.

5
00:00:21,068 --> 00:00:23,502
Ah, good morning.

6
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:25,868
Good morning, Cecil.

7
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:27,770
Top ofthe morning toyou.

8
00:00:31,578 --> 00:00:33,671
Thankyou.

9
00:00:33,747 --> 00:00:34,941
Good-bye, darling.

10
00:00:35,015 --> 00:00:37,745
Woman: Good-bye, Charles.
What time can I expectyou?

11
00:00:37,818 --> 00:00:40,378
Before supper.

12
00:00:46,426 --> 00:00:48,223
(screaming)

13
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:57,597
Man: Put it out!
Put it out!

14
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,853
I forgot what it's like

15
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:49,650
to spend a day in court.

16
00:01:49,723 --> 00:01:50,985
That's one ofthe luxuries

17
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:54,424
to hunting down aliens
and genetic mutants.

18
00:01:54,494 --> 00:01:56,394
You rarely get to press charges.

19
00:01:56,463 --> 00:01:58,431
It's opened.

20
00:01:58,498 --> 00:01:59,226
What?

21
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:00,732
It's unlocked.

22
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:02,029
That's weird.

23
00:02:02,102 --> 00:02:03,592
I'm sure I locked it.

24
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,069
Must be an X-File.

25
00:02:05,172 --> 00:02:07,640
(chuckling)

26
00:02:14,347 --> 00:02:16,542
What's that?

27
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:20,842
I told you I locked the door.

28
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:27,891
What doyou think it is?

29
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:30,259
Ten to one
you can't dance to it.

30
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,567
Woman: Greetings, Agent Mulder.

31
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:38,866
Six months ago, British Minister
of Parliament Reggie Ellicott

32
00:02:38,972 --> 00:02:42,635
received an audiocassette, much like
the oneyou're listening to now.

33
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:45,802
Unfortunately, when he popped
the tape into the car stereo

34
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:49,473
he armed a device which,
when he tried to exit the car

35
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:53,178
created an explosion
which was heard five miles away.

36
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:56,017
The Scotland Yard forensic team
could only identify

37
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:58,887
the poor bastard
by his dental records.

38
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,427
Ifonly he hadn't reached
for the door handle

39
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:03,019
and triggered the detonator.

40
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:05,121
But then how was he to know

41
00:03:05,198 --> 00:03:07,996
he was sitting on enough
plastique explosive

42
00:03:08,068 --> 00:03:10,195
to lift the car 40 feet in the air

43
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,999
and deposit the engine block

44
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:14,403
on top ofa three-story building?

45
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:15,575
(gasps)

46
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:16,507
(gasps)

47
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:18,635
Aren't we looking rather ghostly?

48
00:03:22,182 --> 00:03:25,913
It's an old friend.

49
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:28,320
Aren'tyou going to thank me?

50
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:29,616
Forwhat?

51
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:31,657
Saving your life.

52
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:33,750
One tends not to make
the same mistake twice.

53
00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:35,158
I'll try to remember that.

54
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:36,525
Oh, come on.
Don't tell meyou left

55
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:38,496
your sense ofhumor
in Oxford ten years ago.

56
00:03:38,565 --> 00:03:40,999
No. Actually,
it's one ofthe few things

57
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:42,762
you didn't drive a stake through.

58
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:54,909
Some mistakes are
quite worth making twice.

59
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:59,580
Dana Scully,
this is Phoebe Greene.

60
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:00,984
The terror ofScotland Yard.

61
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:01,986
Hello.

62
00:04:02,055 --> 00:04:03,579
Hello.

63
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:05,522
She hates me.

64
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:07,787
What brings you
to the colonies?

65
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:11,429
Some clever bloke
has been giving

66
00:04:11,498 --> 00:04:13,557
the aristocracy a good scare.

67
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:16,727
Killed offa ranking member
of Parliament or three.

68
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:19,966
Set Windsor Castle
ablaze in '92.

69
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:21,097
Your car bomber?

70
00:04:21,207 --> 00:04:24,472
No. This one likes
to burn his victims alive.

71
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:27,411
Can't figure out
how he does it.

72
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,607
Not a crumb ofevidence
at the crime scene.

73
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:31,446
The last one died
in his front garden.

74
00:04:31,518 --> 00:04:34,214
His pooryoung wife
watching helplessly

75
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:37,051
as he went up in smoke.

76
00:04:37,123 --> 00:04:38,488
The lrish Republican Army?

77
00:04:38,558 --> 00:04:40,753
Our suspect likes
to send love letters

78
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:42,351
to his victims' wives.

79
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:46,263
Sent one to the wife of
Sir Malcolm Marsden a month ago.

80
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,097
Three days later

81
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,069
he narrowly escaped a fire
in his garage.

82
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:52,900
Burned to the ground.

83
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:55,099
So they're renting a place
out on Cape Cod.

84
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,698
Bringing the family
to the States

85
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,573
for an extended holiday

86
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:00,476
or until we catch
the dirty bugger.

87
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:01,844
He's that determined?

88
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:03,883
judging by his success, he takes

89
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,542
certain delight in his work.

90
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:07,610
So what brings you
on this detour

91
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:10,212
to Washington, D.C., lnspector?

92
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,989
I figured my friend, Mulder

93
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:18,462
couldn't resist
a three-pipe problem.

94
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:21,056
I'll run it
by our arson specialist.

95
00:05:21,134 --> 00:05:23,329
Splendid.

96
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:25,997
I'll call London.
Let them know.

97
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:33,442
Oh, good-bye.

98
00:05:39,953 --> 00:05:42,251
Three-pipe problem?

99
00:05:42,322 --> 00:05:44,552
That's from Sherlock Holmes.
It's a privatejoke.

100
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:45,784
How private?

101
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:48,419
Um...

102
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:50,929
we knew each other in school
in England.

103
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:53,795
She was brilliant

104
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:57,428
and I got in over my head
and paid the price.

105
00:05:57,504 --> 00:06:01,406
Mulder, youjust keep unfolding
like a fower.

106
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:05,001
That was over
ten years ago, Scully.

107
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:06,578
Yeah, I noticed

108
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,341
howyou couldn't
drop everything fast enough

109
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:10,042
in order to help her out.

110
00:06:10,116 --> 00:06:13,381
I was merely extending her
a professional courtesy.

111
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:15,318
Oh, is that
whatyou were extending?

112
00:06:15,388 --> 00:06:17,856
I'm going to run this
by the arson guys

113
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:19,414
and then she's on her own.

114
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:20,789
Something tells me

115
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,795
you're not going
to get rid ofher that easily.

116
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:33,396
Beautiful.
Oh,just beautiful.

117
00:06:33,506 --> 00:06:34,734
Look at that.

118
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:36,240
Salmon red fames.

119
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:38,436
This is 1 ,400-1 ,500 degrees.

120
00:06:38,545 --> 00:06:40,672
This is a work ofart.

121
00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:44,975
Was there any kind
ofincendiary device used?

122
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:47,645
Yes, actually,
the victim's body.

123
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:50,588
Spontaneous combustion?

124
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:51,954
He was murdered

125
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:53,390
however, we've turned up
no evidence

126
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,451
that tells us
how the body caught fire.

127
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:56,961
That's peculiar.

128
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,965
People don't normally
just catch on fire.

129
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:03,594
I mean, we burn,
but we don't conduct that well.

130
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,104
There's usually
some extraneous fuel involved

131
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:08,697
Iike candle wax, gasoline--

132
00:07:08,808 --> 00:07:10,469
Something fammable
and incendiary

133
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:12,602
that adheres to the skin.

134
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:13,974
Like an accelerant.

135
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:16,242
Like an accelerant. Yes.

136
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:19,877
We've found nothing
save for a dusting ofmagnesium.

137
00:07:19,953 --> 00:07:21,853
That's aliphatic pyrolysis.

138
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:24,685
It's a residue
from an exothermic reaction.

139
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:26,487
But there's no evidence
ofthe source.

140
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:29,050
No pour pattern
or ignition devices.

141
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:33,691
There have been some arson fires
in Seattle and Pennsylvania.

142
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:35,826
It burns so hot that the firemen
can't put them out.

143
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:37,369
7,000 degrees.

144
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:39,530
Hosing that down makes it worse.

145
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,936
How's that?

146
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,270
The reaction is so intense

147
00:07:43,376 --> 00:07:46,402
that it splits the water
into hydrogen and oxygen.

148
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:48,242
Itjust adds fuel to the fire.

149
00:07:48,314 --> 00:07:50,441
What were they using?

150
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:52,849
We don't know for sure.
It could be rocket fuel.

151
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,079
It burns so hot and clean

152
00:07:54,154 --> 00:07:55,951
there's never a trace left.

153
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:58,217
It's very difficult
to prove arson.

154
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,555
It's driving
the insurance companies nuts.

155
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:05,526
It's about the only explanation
that I can giveyou.

156
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:07,623
There have been cases
ofpyrokinetics.

157
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,998
People who can control
and conduct fire.

158
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:14,062
Well, I've seen fire
bend around corners.

159
00:08:14,174 --> 00:08:16,699
Seen it bounce
like a rubber ball.

160
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,608
Fire has got a certain genius,
you know.

161
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:22,876
A certain demon poetry.

162
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:24,211
It's like it's got
a mind ofits own.

163
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:25,911
But I've never seen one

164
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:27,816
that can defy the laws ofphysics

165
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:30,253
not when you figure it out.

166
00:08:30,323 --> 00:08:32,223
You've, uh...

167
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:34,954
got quite a case
foryourselfhere, Mulder.

168
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:36,791
I almost wish I could be
in your shoes.

169
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:52,007
(car approaching)

170
00:08:58,418 --> 00:09:00,443
Hey,Jackson.

171
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:03,522
Boy, that's a nice house.

172
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,579
What a pleasant surprise.

173
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:07,251
Welcome to America,
Sir Malcolm.

174
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,851
Man: From the top there,
hand them down.

175
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:12,022
Marsden: Thankyou.
I'm delighted to be here.

176
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:14,396
Where's the dog?

177
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:17,231
Darling, you happy?
You like the house?

178
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:20,602
TakeJackson, yes.

179
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:29,839
(chattering)

180
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,817
(Jackson barking)

181
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:34,615
Right there.

182
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:36,211
In here, please. Thankyou.

183
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:38,586
And over there as well.

184
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:40,591
But the second one,
I want upstairs.

185
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,629
Gentlemen, the second set
ofboxes will go up the stairs.

186
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:45,823
Thankyou very much.

187
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:46,888
Hello there.

188
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:48,399
Hello.

189
00:09:48,468 --> 00:09:51,403
I'm Bob, the caretaker.
We've been exchanging letters.

190
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:53,701
Oh, good heavens,
yes, ofcourse.

191
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:55,900
Excuse the paint. Hi.

192
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:59,001
just trying
to spruce the place up foryou.

193
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:00,545
It's delightful.

194
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:02,103
The photos don't do itjustice.

195
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:04,376
Anything I can do foryou,
anything at all

196
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,315
youjust holler.

197
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:07,318
Thankyou, Bob.

198
00:10:07,387 --> 00:10:08,319
Thanks.

199
00:10:11,124 --> 00:10:12,614
Seems like a rather nice fellow,
don'tyou think?

200
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:15,159
Very.

201
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:19,528
My God, darling,
that painting rather looks likeyou.

202
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,226
Don'tyou think?

203
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:23,792
Oh, I don't know.

204
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,337
I've never been good at this.

205
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:35,645
(Jackson whimpering)

206
00:10:39,786 --> 00:10:42,346
(yelps, barks)

207
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:47,058
Bloody little cur.
I'll skin you alive.

208
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:55,166
You see?
I'm the caretaker now.

209
00:10:57,837 --> 00:11:00,362
So, Sherlock,
is the game afoot?

210
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,136
I'm afraid so, Watson.

211
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:05,609
Butyou're off
the hook on this one.

212
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:07,737
What doyou mean?

213
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:10,214
I'm not going
to putyou through this.

214
00:11:10,283 --> 00:11:11,307
Put me through what?

215
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:13,352
Phoebe's little mind game.

216
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:16,115
What areyou talking about?

217
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:17,746
There's something else

218
00:11:17,857 --> 00:11:21,293
I haven't told you
about myself, Scully.

219
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:23,794
(sighs)

220
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:26,388
I hate fire. Hate it.

221
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:29,196
Scared to death ofit.

222
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:31,259
(sighs)

223
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:32,702
When I was a kid

224
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:35,297
my best friend's house burned down.

225
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,967
Had to spend the night
in the rubble

226
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:39,102
to keep away looters.

227
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:41,078
Foryears I had nightmares

228
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:43,479
about being trapped
in a burning building.

229
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:45,881
Wait. Phoebe knows about this?

230
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:49,581
This is classic Phoebe Greene,
mind game player extraordinaire.

231
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:51,714
Ten years it's taken me
to forget her

232
00:11:51,824 --> 00:11:53,792
and she shows up with this case.

233
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:56,361
She shows up knowing the power
she has overyou

234
00:11:56,462 --> 00:11:58,794
and then makes you walk
through fire?

235
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:01,095
Phoebe is fire.

236
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:04,603
Mulder, areyou sureyou
don't want me to helpyou out?

237
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,798
Sooner or later,
a man's got to face his demons.

238
00:12:45,678 --> 00:12:47,509
(coughing)

239
00:12:56,889 --> 00:12:59,357
(coughing)

240
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:03,595
Hello. You're
the Marsdens' driver?

241
00:13:03,663 --> 00:13:05,858
Who's that?

242
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:12,066
Bob. Caretaker.

243
00:13:13,606 --> 00:13:16,541
Oh.

244
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:17,837
Bum a smoke?

245
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,400
Yeah, sure.

246
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,584
I'm going into town.
Can I getyou anything?

247
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,591
Yeah, some cough medicine.

248
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:37,891
Syrup or lozenges?

249
00:13:37,964 --> 00:13:40,364
Syrup would be good.

250
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:45,968
Can I giveyou some money?

251
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:47,027
Appreciate that.

252
00:13:58,718 --> 00:14:00,913
Beer.

253
00:14:18,504 --> 00:14:22,531
They don't letyou
bring your own around here.

254
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:26,305
(British accent:) Well, I guess
they'll just have to make an exception

255
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:27,311
won't they?

256
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:33,051
Oh, you're English.

257
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:35,519
God, I just love that accent.

258
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,119
Allow me.

259
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:41,318
And a gentleman to boot.

260
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:49,164
Oh, my God.

261
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:51,795
Now that is a trick.

262
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:53,463
Hey, guys.

263
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:57,703
Take a look at this.

264
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:00,607
Care for a light?

265
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:06,043
(screaming)

266
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:18,954
I pulled this report offthe wire.

267
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:20,692
Eyewitnesses are saying

268
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:22,757
that a customer
in the bar caught fire.

269
00:15:22,835 --> 00:15:25,099
They're looking for a body.

270
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:27,469
Any indication
an accelerant was used?

271
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,373
The bar's across
from a fire station.

272
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:33,173
It burned to the ground
before they could even respond.

273
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:35,111
It burned so hot

274
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:37,206
it turned the concrete
foundation into sponge cake.

275
00:15:37,283 --> 00:15:38,580
This woman was in the bar.

276
00:15:38,651 --> 00:15:41,017
Hello?

277
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:42,611
Hello.

278
00:15:42,722 --> 00:15:44,189
Miss Patrick?

279
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:46,350
I'm Special Agent Mulder
from the F.B.I.

280
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:50,361
This is lnspector Greene.

281
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:53,065
Can you tell us what happened
in the bar last night?

282
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,360
There was this guy.

283
00:15:56,902 --> 00:16:00,838
I'd had a few drinks so...

284
00:16:00,906 --> 00:16:06,071
He sat next to me
and he did this thing.

285
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:08,079
It was like a magic trick

286
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:09,705
where he lit his finger on fire.

287
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:14,985
Next thing I turned around
he was up in fames.

288
00:16:15,054 --> 00:16:18,820
Can you describe him?

289
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:20,722
Good-looking, I think.

290
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:22,784
Brownish hair.

291
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:24,557
Long hair, short hair?

292
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,461
I gave the police
the information.

293
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:29,524
Doyou thinkyou could work
with a composite artist?

294
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:31,126
I had a few drinks...

295
00:16:31,237 --> 00:16:32,727
Can I getyour full name
and address?

296
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:33,862
See...

297
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:40,507
I live with someone.
He thinks I was at school last night.

298
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:43,548
It's no problem.
You can come down...

299
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:46,176
to the office
and workwith somebody there.

300
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:48,152
I'll giveyou a minute
to think about it, okay?

301
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,330
Deftly done, Agent Mulder.

302
00:16:59,398 --> 00:17:01,866
Casually disregard
her indiscretion.

303
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:04,698
Firm but polite manner
until she accedes to cooperate.

304
00:17:04,804 --> 00:17:07,796
It's a technique I refined
in my relationship with you.

305
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:13,072
Oh, I seeyou haven't lost
your sense ofhumor after all.

306
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:17,406
I'm sorry.
That was a cheap shot.

307
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:22,511
I don't want
to dredge up the past.

308
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:25,148
Let'sjust stick
to the case.

309
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:27,215
Let's.

310
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:33,989
Look...

311
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:35,499
Unless I'm mistaken

312
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:38,264
ten years seems sufficient time
to have forgiven

313
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:41,238
ifnot forgotten
a fewyouthful indiscretions.

314
00:17:41,307 --> 00:17:43,172
I'm cursed
with a photographic memory.

315
00:17:46,212 --> 00:17:48,271
Then don'tyou tell me
thatyou've forgotten

316
00:17:48,347 --> 00:17:52,113
a certain youthful indiscretion

317
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:54,345
atop SirArthur Conan Doyle's tombstone

318
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,823
on a misty night in Windlesham.

319
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:01,724
Like I said,
let'sjust stick to the case.

320
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:06,356
It occurred to me that
we're going to a lot oftrouble

321
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:09,595
to find a description ofa man
who in all likelihood

322
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:11,158
has been burned to a crisp.

323
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,535
I would agree with you,
but they haven't found a bodyyet.

324
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:21,137
So can we count on you?

325
00:18:21,213 --> 00:18:22,976
Yeah, okay.

326
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:25,346
Thanks.

327
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:27,443
I don't know ifit matters

328
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,513
but I remembered something else
about the guywho caught fire.

329
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,057
He had an English accent.

330
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,628
(coughing)

331
00:18:42,435 --> 00:18:43,925
Having a rough time, huh?

332
00:18:52,645 --> 00:18:54,579
Maybe it's the cough syrup.

333
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:27,043
Scully: After reviewing the files
ofthe Scotland Yard arson murders

334
00:19:27,112 --> 00:19:29,478
two points remain unexplained.

335
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:32,483
One is the use of
an untraceable accelerant.

336
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:35,918
The other involves the victims.

337
00:19:35,988 --> 00:19:38,980
Since they all burned in
the presence offamily members

338
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:41,856
in safe surroundings

339
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:47,126
this indicates unusually intimate access
to the victims by the arsonist.

340
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:51,966
The arsonist is most likely a male,
less than 25 years ofage.

341
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:54,266
He will often act out ofimpulse

342
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:57,171
satisfying sexual urges
or insecurities

343
00:19:57,243 --> 00:20:00,371
with destructive behavior
which compensates

344
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:03,347
for his social inadequacies
or maladjustments.

345
00:20:03,415 --> 00:20:06,248
You boys want
to see a magic trick?

346
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:08,843
Okay.

347
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:09,888
What's your names?

348
00:20:09,955 --> 00:20:11,252
Michael andJimmie.

349
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:12,415
Doesn't he talk?

350
00:20:12,491 --> 00:20:14,925
Yes.

351
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:17,892
What kind ofmagic trick?

352
00:20:17,963 --> 00:20:19,328
Maybe I'd better not.

353
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:20,763
Show us.

354
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:21,925
You might tell your parents.

355
00:20:22,001 --> 00:20:23,093
We won't.

356
00:20:23,202 --> 00:20:25,170
Really? Promise?

357
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:26,363
Promise.

358
00:20:26,472 --> 00:20:29,066
Hope to die--
stick a needle in your eye?

359
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:32,243
Okay, boys.

360
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:35,245
You've taken the solemn oath
that can't be broken

361
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:38,442
except under penalty

362
00:20:38,517 --> 00:20:40,644
ofdeath.

363
00:20:44,557 --> 00:20:46,491
Watch.

364
00:20:48,694 --> 00:20:49,922
Is it in there?

365
00:20:49,995 --> 00:20:51,360
No.

366
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:53,963
You're too smart for me.

367
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:56,968
Where did it go?

368
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:58,297
Where doyou think?

369
00:20:58,404 --> 00:20:59,598
I don't know.

370
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:04,199
I think I remember.

371
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:11,138
(grunting)

372
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:12,478
Ta-da!

373
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:15,812
Ooh!

374
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:18,482
Do it again.

375
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:20,752
Okay, I'll do it again.

376
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,521
(knocking)

377
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:28,226
Agent Beatty?

378
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,824
I'm Special Agent Dana Scully.

379
00:21:29,902 --> 00:21:31,699
Can I steal a minute ofyour time?

380
00:21:31,804 --> 00:21:34,637
Sure, I'm just working

381
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:37,175
on this Mafia torchjob here.

382
00:21:37,242 --> 00:21:39,802
I'm working with Agent Mulder.

383
00:21:39,878 --> 00:21:41,675
Oh, yeah, wild case.

384
00:21:41,747 --> 00:21:43,715
So, what can I do foryou?

385
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:45,841
You mentioned that the arsonist
might be using

386
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:49,217
some kind ofrocket fuel
as an accelerant.

387
00:21:49,288 --> 00:21:52,985
It still doesn't explain how
he sets bodies on fire.

388
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:58,860
What ifhe got some ofthis fuel
into some hand cream or...

389
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:01,957
Well, you've got to understand

390
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:03,695
even the smallest amounts
ofthis stuff

391
00:22:03,802 --> 00:22:07,670
can produce temperatures
over 5,000 degrees.

392
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,402
But I suppose
it's not impossible.

393
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:12,205
Extremely diluted.

394
00:22:12,277 --> 00:22:14,074
Butyou still have to find
a way to ignite it.

395
00:22:15,481 --> 00:22:18,507
Wow! It lit by itself!.

396
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:22,543
Come on, sit down.

397
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:26,523
So, you guys
ever smoked a cigarette?

398
00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:28,082
No. They're bad foryou.

399
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,390
Would you like to take a puff?

400
00:22:30,462 --> 00:22:32,521
No.

401
00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:34,293
Make a man out ofyou.

402
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:35,856
I don't want to.

403
00:22:35,934 --> 00:22:37,561
Why don'tyou hold one for me?

404
00:22:40,939 --> 00:22:43,772
How aboutyou,Jimmie?

405
00:22:43,842 --> 00:22:47,369
Huh, little man?

406
00:22:56,455 --> 00:23:00,516
Woman:Jimmie, Michael.

407
00:23:01,794 --> 00:23:05,161
Hello. Bob.

408
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,357
Thereyou are.

409
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:09,765
We've had a bit ofbad news.

410
00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:11,836
Our driver has taken ill

411
00:23:11,937 --> 00:23:14,701
and we're due at a party
in Boston this evening.

412
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:17,071
Is there any chance that we
can impose upon you

413
00:23:17,142 --> 00:23:18,541
to drive the family into town?

414
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:22,068
We would payyou foryour time
and putyou up for the night.

415
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:24,411
I'd be happy to do it
as a favor.

416
00:23:24,483 --> 00:23:26,348
Thankyou.

417
00:23:26,418 --> 00:23:29,114
Boys, let's go.
Daddy's got lunch ready.

418
00:23:29,254 --> 00:23:33,054
jimmie, you're filthy.

419
00:23:35,527 --> 00:23:39,486
Scully: The arsonist
is usually unmarried

420
00:23:39,565 --> 00:23:42,864
and prone to obsessive fantasies
about women or men...

421
00:23:42,935 --> 00:23:44,869
who are inaccessible to him.

422
00:23:44,937 --> 00:23:47,497
Often the setting offires
results from his cowardice

423
00:23:47,573 --> 00:23:51,669
and inability to develop
a natural relationship.

424
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:55,874
His crimes are often very clever
and elaborately planned.

425
00:23:55,981 --> 00:23:58,575
The suspicious nature
ofthe fire last night

426
00:23:58,684 --> 00:24:01,653
strongly suggests the arsonist
has followed Lord Marsden

427
00:24:01,754 --> 00:24:04,382
to the United States.

428
00:24:04,456 --> 00:24:08,153
A check ofrecent immigration
to the Northeastern area

429
00:24:08,227 --> 00:24:10,388
is underway.

430
00:24:10,462 --> 00:24:16,230
It has become not a matter ofif,
but when he will strike.

431
00:24:16,301 --> 00:24:18,394
Man: Here's
that immigration data you wanted.

432
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,459
Thankyou.

433
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:21,369
You're welcome.

434
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:26,006
Remember those reports about people

435
00:24:26,078 --> 00:24:28,137
who control and conduct fire--
pyrokinetics?

436
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:29,509
Vaguely.

437
00:24:29,615 --> 00:24:32,607
I think this guy sent us
a message that he's more exotic.

438
00:24:32,718 --> 00:24:35,482
I should say so,
ifhe can set himselfafire.

439
00:24:35,554 --> 00:24:37,385
- (laughs)
- What?

440
00:24:37,456 --> 00:24:40,983
I'm just not used to someone
so quick to agree with me.

441
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:43,027
What protection
does the family have?

442
00:24:43,095 --> 00:24:44,892
The driver's
a very capable bodyguard.

443
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:48,399
He should get additional men
and limit public exposure.

444
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:51,027
They've got a party in
their honor tonight in Boston.

445
00:24:51,103 --> 00:24:53,128
They'll have to cancel.

446
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:55,264
Unless you wanted to set a trap.

447
00:24:57,075 --> 00:24:58,702
I had thought ofthat.

448
00:24:58,777 --> 00:25:03,009
But we must be careful
and discreet.

449
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:05,049
The party's at 8:00
at the Venable Plaza.

450
00:25:05,117 --> 00:25:06,448
I'll be traveling with the family

451
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:09,646
so why don'tyou go ahead
and look around?

452
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:12,884
I've taken a room
at the hotel for the night.

453
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:33,277
Thanks.

454
00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:36,904
Good night. Thankyou.

455
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:58,964
(phone ringing)

456
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:01,938
Mulder.

457
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:03,497
It's Scully. Where areyou?

458
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:05,440
I'm in Boston.

459
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,909
I've got something to showyou.

460
00:26:07,012 --> 00:26:08,479
I'm coming up there.

461
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,808
What haveyou got?

462
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:11,405
I might have some information

463
00:26:11,516 --> 00:26:13,381
on your arson suspect.

464
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:16,353
(clears throat)

465
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:17,718
Areyou there, Mulder?

466
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:20,986
Yeah. Yeah.

467
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,356
Can I meetyou somewhere?

468
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:24,452
No, it'sjust,
I'm kind ofanticipating

469
00:26:24,496 --> 00:26:26,088
having my hands full.

470
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:34,569
Hey, we're here!

471
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,732
Thankyou.

472
00:26:35,807 --> 00:26:37,274
Let's go inside.

473
00:26:37,342 --> 00:26:38,809
Evening, sir.

474
00:26:38,877 --> 00:26:40,572
Hello.

475
00:27:28,493 --> 00:27:30,518
Enjoying yourself?

476
00:27:30,595 --> 00:27:32,222
There's good food,
witty conversation.

477
00:27:32,297 --> 00:27:34,993
I'm having the time ofmy life.

478
00:27:37,636 --> 00:27:39,467
I wondered ifyou think
it's safe enough

479
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:42,507
to indulge ourselves
in a dance?

480
00:27:42,574 --> 00:27:46,601
Doesn't look likeyour arsonist
is going to make an appearance.

481
00:27:46,678 --> 00:27:50,842
That doesn't mean there
won't be any fires to put out.

482
00:27:59,358 --> 00:28:00,985
I've thought aboutyou often.

483
00:28:40,165 --> 00:28:44,158
(beeping)

484
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,597
There's a fire upstairs.

485
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:48,696
What?

486
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:49,798
On the 1 4th foor.

487
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,172
That's where the children are.

488
00:29:06,892 --> 00:29:11,591
You've got a fire
on the 1 4th foor.

489
00:29:11,663 --> 00:29:15,121
(alarm ringing)

490
00:29:35,153 --> 00:29:36,848
Boys: Help! Help!

491
00:29:36,922 --> 00:29:38,890
(coughing)

492
00:30:09,888 --> 00:30:12,049
Hurry up!

493
00:30:12,124 --> 00:30:13,819
Here we are.

494
00:30:13,892 --> 00:30:15,587
(coughing)

495
00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:24,493
Here we are. Got one down.
Come on, buddy. Come on.

496
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:27,538
Hereyou go.

497
00:30:27,606 --> 00:30:29,870
Can you walk?
Can you get him?

498
00:30:29,941 --> 00:30:32,774
I got him. Hold on!

499
00:30:32,844 --> 00:30:35,312
Here we are.

500
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,847
Mommy!

501
00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:39,349
jimmie! Michael!
Areyou all right?

502
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:44,846
You saved their lives.

503
00:30:44,923 --> 00:30:46,652
Who is he?

504
00:30:46,725 --> 00:30:48,090
He's the driver.

505
00:30:51,663 --> 00:30:53,790
Thanks. Thanks.

506
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:02,802
Well done. Goodjob.
Thankyou.

507
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:10,539
(coughing)

508
00:31:18,757 --> 00:31:20,816
You were really out.

509
00:31:24,863 --> 00:31:26,228
Where's Phoebe?

510
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:27,993
She's down the hall.

511
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:31,524
What about the kids?

512
00:31:31,603 --> 00:31:34,538
Okay. The doctor
checked them out.

513
00:31:43,014 --> 00:31:45,710
What happened toyou up there?

514
00:31:47,686 --> 00:31:48,880
I panicked.

515
00:31:48,987 --> 00:31:51,114
Couldn't even move, Scully.

516
00:31:51,223 --> 00:31:52,690
It could have happened to anyone.

517
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:56,090
Yeah... but it happened to me.

518
00:31:56,161 --> 00:32:00,029
I haired out...
plain and simple.

519
00:32:00,098 --> 00:32:01,224
What doyou know about

520
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:05,668
this guy that saved the kids--
the driver?

521
00:32:05,737 --> 00:32:10,538
I checked him out
prior to the Marsdens' arrival.

522
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:13,203
He's worked on the property
for eightyears.

523
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:14,745
No record.

524
00:32:14,813 --> 00:32:16,610
His references checked out.

525
00:32:16,681 --> 00:32:17,841
Theywere lucky
he was here tonight.

526
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:19,508
Who was watching the kids?

527
00:32:19,584 --> 00:32:20,676
He was.

528
00:32:20,752 --> 00:32:22,947
I could have sworn
I saw him in the hall

529
00:32:23,054 --> 00:32:25,921
about the same time
the fire broke out.

530
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:27,458
You couldn't have.

531
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:28,856
Anyway, the man we're
looking for is English.

532
00:32:28,927 --> 00:32:30,588
Hey.

533
00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:34,294
I came to see ifyou were okay.

534
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:37,201
How are the kids?

535
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:39,703
They're fine.

536
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:41,261
Everybody's anxious to get back.

537
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:43,068
To the Cape?

538
00:32:43,141 --> 00:32:44,904
They've made travel arrangements

539
00:32:44,976 --> 00:32:47,103
back to England
for the day after tomorrow.

540
00:32:47,178 --> 00:32:49,009
And you?

541
00:32:50,382 --> 00:32:52,043
I'll be leaving in a few days.

542
00:32:56,354 --> 00:33:00,188
Look, I'll giveyou a ring
back at the Bureau before I leave.

543
00:33:04,362 --> 00:33:05,920
Good-bye.

544
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:10,665
You okay?

545
00:33:10,735 --> 00:33:12,703
Yeah.

546
00:33:12,771 --> 00:33:14,432
You at all interested in what I came

547
00:33:14,506 --> 00:33:17,407
all the way up here to showyou?

548
00:33:17,475 --> 00:33:19,409
Yeah.

549
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,174
Well, I did some checking
on my own.

550
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,447
I didn't know a whole lot
about arson or arsonists

551
00:33:28,553 --> 00:33:30,748
so I took the opportunity

552
00:33:30,855 --> 00:33:33,517
for my own edification,
ofcourse.

553
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:38,660
I ran a profile
ofpossible incendiary fuels

554
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:42,131
and accelerants that could
have been used in the crimes.

555
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,168
I also took the liberty

556
00:33:44,235 --> 00:33:46,362
ofrunning a search through lnterpol

557
00:33:46,438 --> 00:33:48,372
ofall the gardeners,
manservants and domestic help

558
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,032
that were hired
by the murdervictims

559
00:33:50,108 --> 00:33:52,235
at the time oftheir deaths.

560
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,141
And..?

561
00:33:54,212 --> 00:33:57,545
These people probably
don't even tie their own shoes.

562
00:33:57,615 --> 00:34:00,140
There were over 200 names

563
00:34:00,218 --> 00:34:03,949
and not a duplicate...
except one.

564
00:34:04,055 --> 00:34:06,489
A Cecil Lively.

565
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:08,583
He worked as a gardener
for two ofthe victims.

566
00:34:08,693 --> 00:34:10,456
And what did you find on him?

567
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:11,688
Nothing.

568
00:34:11,763 --> 00:34:13,594
So he's clean.

569
00:34:13,665 --> 00:34:15,826
He was questioned
by Scotland Yard

570
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,859
and they released him,
but I dug a little further.

571
00:34:19,938 --> 00:34:23,101
Cecil Lively
is a documented citizen

572
00:34:23,174 --> 00:34:25,768
ofGreat Britain,
paid his taxes

573
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:28,506
never been on the dole,
a model citizen--

574
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:32,539
until he died in 1 971
in a London tenement fire.

575
00:34:32,617 --> 00:34:36,383
I know.
That's what I thought.

576
00:34:36,488 --> 00:34:38,979
So, I checked a little further.

577
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,752
Cecil L'lvely, spelled
" L" apostrophe, came up again.

578
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,794
In fact, it came up twice--

579
00:34:43,862 --> 00:34:45,762
First, on a list
ofdeath certificates

580
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,264
Iisted among a group ofchildren
who died in ritual sacrifice

581
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:51,734
by a satanic cult in 1 963

582
00:34:51,803 --> 00:34:54,397
in the Tottingham Woods
outside Bath, England.

583
00:34:54,472 --> 00:34:55,803
Where else did you find it?

584
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:57,341
You're going to love this.

585
00:34:57,409 --> 00:34:58,774
On a list ofrecent visas

586
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:00,777
issued by the British government.

587
00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:02,710
Cecil L'lvely's passport

588
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:04,476
was stamped by
U.S. immigration officials

589
00:35:04,549 --> 00:35:09,111
two weeks ago
at the port ofentry in Boston.

590
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,552
Call the local field office
in Boston ofthe F.B.I.

591
00:35:11,656 --> 00:35:13,317
and get them to faxyou
the composite the witness did

592
00:35:13,425 --> 00:35:15,188
ofthe man
who burned down the bar.

593
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,251
Then get them to fax it
to every local law agency.

594
00:35:17,362 --> 00:35:18,852
What areyou going to do?

595
00:35:18,963 --> 00:35:20,294
I'm going to try
and catch Phoebe.

596
00:35:20,365 --> 00:35:23,425
This guy could be waiting
for them in Cape Cod.

597
00:35:27,939 --> 00:35:29,429
Yes, this is Special Agent Scully.

598
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:31,441
I've been waiting on hold foryou guys

599
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:34,103
to fax me a composite
ofan arson suspect.

600
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:37,239
Right. Hang on a second.

601
00:35:37,315 --> 00:35:38,907
It's coming through.

602
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:41,076
Thanks.

603
00:35:50,295 --> 00:35:53,628
Oh, my God.
It's the driver.

604
00:36:00,939 --> 00:36:03,373
The cellular customer
you are trying to reach

605
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:05,375
is out ofthe area.

606
00:36:25,296 --> 00:36:27,696
(clearing throat)

607
00:36:27,765 --> 00:36:29,528
Excuse me.

608
00:36:33,705 --> 00:36:36,572
His name is Cecil L'lvely.

609
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:37,573
Who?

610
00:36:37,642 --> 00:36:38,768
Your arsonist.

611
00:36:38,843 --> 00:36:41,277
Where's the rest ofthe family?

612
00:36:41,346 --> 00:36:42,779
Theywent outside for a walk.

613
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:44,212
Well, go find them.

614
00:36:44,282 --> 00:36:48,378
We've got to get them packed
and get them out ofhere.

615
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:54,786
Come on. We have to hurry.

616
00:36:54,893 --> 00:36:56,861
I'm sorry, children.
We have to leave right away.

617
00:36:56,928 --> 00:37:00,125
Can't we stay one more day?

618
00:37:00,198 --> 00:37:02,393
Please, Mother,
can't we stay one more day?

619
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:05,732
We're having so much fun.

620
00:37:06,804 --> 00:37:09,534
We're having so much fun.

621
00:37:17,215 --> 00:37:19,240
(knocking)

622
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:24,477
It's the driver.

623
00:37:24,556 --> 00:37:27,457
I know. He disappeared.

624
00:37:27,525 --> 00:37:29,390
What's the matter?

625
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,963
Nothing. Um, I found this
out in the garage.

626
00:37:31,963 --> 00:37:34,397
Nothing. Um, I found this
out in the garage.

627
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:36,092
It's been very hard
on the family.

628
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,327
Did you get the composite?

629
00:37:38,436 --> 00:37:39,903
Yes.

630
00:37:40,004 --> 00:37:42,063
I don't believe it.
I can't believe it.

631
00:37:42,173 --> 00:37:44,107
He's worked for us
for over ten years.

632
00:37:44,175 --> 00:37:48,168
Obviously there's been
some type ofmistake.

633
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:49,907
Oh.

634
00:37:49,981 --> 00:37:52,040
Oh, my God!

635
00:37:52,116 --> 00:37:53,378
This isn't the driver.

636
00:37:53,451 --> 00:37:54,645
It's the caretaker.

637
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,983
Lady Marsden:
And he's upstairs with the children.

638
00:37:57,055 --> 00:38:00,252
Michael!Jimmie!

639
00:38:00,325 --> 00:38:02,190
Michael?

640
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,251
Michael!

641
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:05,990
jimmie?!

642
00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:15,996
Looks like we found
the missing driver.

643
00:38:16,107 --> 00:38:18,166
Phoebe:
Mulder! ln here! Quickly!

644
00:38:18,242 --> 00:38:20,210
What's going on?

645
00:38:20,278 --> 00:38:23,213
Theyjust went up
all by themselves!

646
00:38:23,281 --> 00:38:24,976
What about the boys?

647
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:27,017
My God!

648
00:38:40,698 --> 00:38:41,630
Good God!

649
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:42,529
Everybody out!

650
00:38:42,634 --> 00:38:43,726
Let's go!

651
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:45,564
Go! Go! Go!

652
00:38:48,106 --> 00:38:51,542
I think he rigged the whole house.

653
00:38:51,609 --> 00:38:52,541
Oh, no!

654
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,077
It's fuel.

655
00:38:54,145 --> 00:38:55,840
- What?!
- My God!

656
00:38:55,913 --> 00:38:58,507
Go! Go!

657
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:01,381
Get downstairs.

658
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,282
Scully, see ifyou can find
a fire extinguisher.

659
00:39:05,356 --> 00:39:06,345
Everybody else, outside.

660
00:39:06,424 --> 00:39:07,891
But what about the children?

661
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:11,053
(thudding,Jackson barking)

662
00:39:11,129 --> 00:39:14,326
I'll take care
ofthe children. Go!

663
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:15,798
Will you be okay, Mulder?

664
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,424
Oh, yeah. I'll be fine.

665
00:39:17,535 --> 00:39:20,368
There's no place I'd rather be.

666
00:39:39,724 --> 00:39:42,693
(thudding,Jackson barking)

667
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,285
Michael?!Jimmie?!

668
00:39:45,363 --> 00:39:46,830
You in there?!

669
00:39:46,898 --> 00:39:50,197
(boys yelling)

670
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:55,764
Time to call 91 1 .

671
00:39:57,341 --> 00:39:58,569
Don't move!

672
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:27,335
Freeze!

673
00:40:27,405 --> 00:40:28,667
Federal agent.

674
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,174
You won't shoot me.

675
00:40:33,144 --> 00:40:34,577
Stay right whereyou are.

676
00:40:37,048 --> 00:40:39,482
You see?

677
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:45,011
Becauseyou don't know
that the spark from that round

678
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:48,183
won't blow this whole house
to kingdom come.

679
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:08,003
Back off, Scully.
It's the accelerant!

680
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,740
No! No!

681
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,248
(boys screaming)

682
00:41:43,347 --> 00:41:47,977
Michael!Jimmie! Thank God!

683
00:41:53,057 --> 00:41:56,925
(laughing)

684
00:41:56,994 --> 00:41:59,690
You can't kill me.

685
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:06,102
(laughing)

686
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:11,107
You can't fight fire with fire.

687
00:42:11,209 --> 00:42:14,667
(laughing)

688
00:42:32,763 --> 00:42:34,526
(clicking)

689
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:37,796
Care to take me to lunch?

690
00:42:37,902 --> 00:42:39,665
Scareyou?

691
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:41,237
You have no idea.

692
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:44,308
Where is Phoebe?

693
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:45,705
I don't know.

694
00:42:45,776 --> 00:42:49,803
You don't know.
She didn't call?

695
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:53,977
No. She did messenger this to me
last night, though.

696
00:42:54,051 --> 00:42:55,279
Did you play it?

697
00:42:55,353 --> 00:42:57,787
No.

698
00:42:57,855 --> 00:42:59,618
Why not?

699
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:03,319
Aren'tyou curious
what's on it?

700
00:43:03,394 --> 00:43:06,488
Ten to one
you can't dance to it.

701
00:43:12,203 --> 00:43:16,333
Scully: X-File number 1 1 21 4893.

702
00:43:16,407 --> 00:43:20,867
Addendum to the file opened
by Special Agent Mulder.

703
00:43:20,945 --> 00:43:24,608
The arson suspect Cecil L'lvely
was admitted to Boston Mercy Hospital...

704
00:43:24,682 --> 00:43:28,812
with fifth and sixth degree burns
over his entire body.

705
00:43:28,886 --> 00:43:30,581
Military burn specialists

706
00:43:30,655 --> 00:43:31,986
have been brought in
to study the case

707
00:43:32,056 --> 00:43:34,957
which they're calling
extraordinary

708
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:37,756
not only for the fact
the suspect survived

709
00:43:37,828 --> 00:43:41,764
but for the rapid regeneration
ofhis basal cell tissue.

710
00:43:41,832 --> 00:43:45,165
Full recovery is anticipated
in as little as a month.

711
00:43:47,905 --> 00:43:49,736
Scully:
L'lvely is being held

712
00:43:49,807 --> 00:43:51,934
in a high-security medical facility

713
00:43:52,009 --> 00:43:53,943
confined to a hyperbaric chamber

714
00:43:54,011 --> 00:43:55,945
until he can be tried
on murder charges

715
00:43:56,013 --> 00:43:58,846
in the death
ofa Massachusetts caretaker.

716
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:03,478
His body temperature remains
at a steady 1 09 degrees.

717
00:44:03,554 --> 00:44:05,488
Health technicians have removed

718
00:44:05,556 --> 00:44:07,524
anything fammable from his room

719
00:44:07,591 --> 00:44:10,185
due to several fires
which have broken out in the vicinity.

720
00:44:10,261 --> 00:44:11,990
According to Agent Mulder

721
00:44:12,063 --> 00:44:13,758
further incarceration
remains a problem

722
00:44:13,831 --> 00:44:17,232
for federal penal authorities.

723
00:44:17,335 --> 00:44:21,362
Can I getyou anything, sir?
