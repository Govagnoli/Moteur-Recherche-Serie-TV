1
00:00:26,217 --> 00:00:28,276
[Engine Stops]

2
00:01:24,942 --> 00:01:27,069
[Doggett] Hey!

3
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,910
<i>[Scratching]</i>

4
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:13,643
Jane Doe.

5
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:17,551
Found last night
entombed in a tenement wall...

6
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:21,352
by an agent who was following
an anonymous tip.

7
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:25,224
Time of death,
approximately 2100 hours...

8
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:28,594
from three stab wounds
to the abdomen.

9
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:30,690
Dirt and clay were found...

10
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:33,599
under the nails
of her right hand.

11
00:03:33,704 --> 00:03:36,070
What are those lacerations
on her arms and feet?

12
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:39,768
Predation... from rats.

13
00:03:39,877 --> 00:03:43,438
The agent was led to her body
by the sound of their feeding.

14
00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:47,706
Anyone?

15
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:50,378
She was killed
someplace else.

16
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:51,545
She clawed at the dirt...

17
00:03:51,655 --> 00:03:53,088
before succumbing
to her injuries.

18
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,215
That's possible.

19
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:59,057
What else would help us
I.D. This victim...

20
00:03:59,163 --> 00:04:02,929
find the killer?

21
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:04,762
It's obvious, isn't it?

22
00:04:04,868 --> 00:04:06,426
What is?

23
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,138
The chipped nail polish.

24
00:04:10,774 --> 00:04:12,765
The drugstore hair rinse.

25
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:17,939
This is a single woman,
unemployed.

26
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:20,073
That's why no one's I.D.'d her.

27
00:04:20,184 --> 00:04:21,776
You found blood alcohol?

28
00:04:21,885 --> 00:04:24,683
Point zero four.

29
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:27,120
She hooked up with the wrong man
in a bar.

30
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:31,321
He killed her.

31
00:04:33,797 --> 00:04:37,130
This man has killed before.

32
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:39,464
And you know that because...

33
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,538
That bruise beneath her ribs?

34
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,598
It's from
the hilt of a knife.

35
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,768
The killer
intended a single blow...

36
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:53,246
the blade thrusting upward
at a 45-degree angle...

37
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,148
into the heart,
causing death instantly.

38
00:04:56,253 --> 00:05:00,212
But she struggled,
so he missed.

39
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:03,350
Then he got mad.

40
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,658
Like I said... obvious.

41
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:48,432
Agent Scully?

42
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,063
Great: Thank you.

43
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:52,867
You got something?

44
00:05:52,976 --> 00:05:54,273
Quite a lot, actually.

45
00:05:54,378 --> 00:05:56,778
We've identified yourJane Doe,
as Ellen Persich, 28...

46
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,938
from Redland, Maryland.

47
00:05:58,048 --> 00:06:01,176
How'd you make
the I.D. So fast?

48
00:06:01,285 --> 00:06:03,116
The bar that she was at
last night...

49
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,312
is about a half a mile...

50
00:06:04,421 --> 00:06:05,718
from where another woman,
Rita Shaw...

51
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,949
was murdered two weeks ago...

52
00:06:07,057 --> 00:06:09,184
apparently by
the same killer.

53
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:12,592
You're saying the bodyJohn
found was the second victim?

54
00:06:12,696 --> 00:06:15,164
This says that Rita Shaw
was found in a ditch...

55
00:06:15,265 --> 00:06:16,994
dead from a single knife wound.

56
00:06:17,101 --> 00:06:19,592
The woman I found
was plastered behind a wall...

57
00:06:19,703 --> 00:06:21,034
and stabbed three times.

58
00:06:21,138 --> 00:06:23,368
That's why I didn't make
the connection at first, either...

59
00:06:23,474 --> 00:06:24,941
but that was the lab
on the phone...

60
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:27,374
and they confirmed that it was
the same knife in both killings.

61
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:28,945
Well, how did you
make the connection?

62
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:30,104
I didn't...

63
00:06:30,214 --> 00:06:32,546
but one of my students realized
that the killer...

64
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:34,981
only meant to stab
Agent Doggett's victim once.

65
00:06:35,085 --> 00:06:36,746
The other wounds
were out of anger...

66
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,116
because he missed.

67
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:41,123
That's a pretty astute observation.

68
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:42,487
Amazingly so.

69
00:06:42,593 --> 00:06:44,959
This cadet have any other
answers up his sleeve?

70
00:06:45,062 --> 00:06:47,121
Like what?

71
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:49,756
I want to know why someone tipped
me off to this in the first place...

72
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,892
'cause this isn't an X-file...
not by a long shot.

73
00:06:52,002 --> 00:06:54,061
I don't know, Agent Doggett,
but now that you've got this case...

74
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:55,934
I'd say run with it.

75
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:11,588
Ted Hayes?

76
00:07:11,688 --> 00:07:14,282
Rudolph Hayes?

77
00:07:16,426 --> 00:07:20,157
I'm Agent Doggett.
This is Agent Reyes.

78
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:31,029
Is that part of the training here,
Cadet, smelling body parts?

79
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:34,975
This man's flesh
smells of creosote...

80
00:07:35,078 --> 00:07:37,205
but his skin is soft.

81
00:07:37,314 --> 00:07:40,112
Untanned.

82
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:42,276
He worked indoors.

83
00:07:42,386 --> 00:07:44,411
A hardware store, probably.

84
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:48,287
The tear marks at his elbow
go from left to right.

85
00:07:48,392 --> 00:07:51,054
He was broadsided
in a car accident.

86
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:53,994
His hands gripped the wheel
so hard...

87
00:07:54,097 --> 00:07:56,531
his thumb bone
snapped on impact.

88
00:07:58,368 --> 00:08:02,395
You determined all that
just by looking at that arm?

89
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:06,971
I see things.

90
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,674
We came to thank you.

91
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,010
Because of your analysis...

92
00:08:13,116 --> 00:08:14,845
we were able
to work up a profile...

93
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,715
to catch the man
who murdered those women.

94
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,878
What's the profile?

95
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:21,253
White male, 25 to 35,
ex-military.

96
00:08:21,358 --> 00:08:23,485
Employed near the bars
where he met...

97
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:25,255
Why are you shaking your head?

98
00:08:25,362 --> 00:08:27,227
The profile's wrong.

99
00:08:28,765 --> 00:08:32,064
Your killer is in his 40s.

100
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,433
A felon, recently arrived
from out of state.

101
00:08:34,538 --> 00:08:38,304
His parole officer thinks
he's looking for a job.

102
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:43,402
He already has one...
working for organized crime.

103
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:47,910
He's killed many people.

104
00:08:49,653 --> 00:08:52,053
He's going to keep on killing.

105
00:08:59,963 --> 00:09:02,295
Kind of annoying, isn't he?

106
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,890
John.

107
00:10:51,408 --> 00:10:53,603
Nicholas Regali?

108
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,010
I'm Agent Reyes.
This is Agent Doggett.

109
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,174
Oh, don't put them
away so fast, Agents.

110
00:11:00,283 --> 00:11:01,807
I want to read them.

111
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:09,221
John Jay... Dog... it.

112
00:11:11,161 --> 00:11:13,652
[Whispering]
Monica Reyes.

113
00:11:13,764 --> 00:11:17,791
Mr. Regali, you're in town in violation
of the terms of your parole...

114
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:19,334
back in New York.

115
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:20,562
Call my parole officer.

116
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,001
She'll tell you I'm here
looking for work.

117
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:28,170
You come here often,
Mr. Regali?

118
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:30,212
Like last night...

119
00:11:30,313 --> 00:11:33,009
when Ellen Persich got murdered
in the parking lot out back?

120
00:11:35,018 --> 00:11:37,748
Last night.
I don't remember.

121
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:41,290
Maybe you remember
being at the Bent Oak.

122
00:11:41,391 --> 00:11:43,689
Bartender says he saw
you there two weeks ago.

123
00:11:43,794 --> 00:11:47,059
The same night a woman named
Rita Shaw got stabbed in the heart.

124
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,725
What do you have to say
about that, Mr. Regali?

125
00:11:53,537 --> 00:11:57,234
You folks don't know
what you're dealing with.

126
00:12:00,811 --> 00:12:03,541
You don't want to play
this game, flatfoot.

127
00:12:03,647 --> 00:12:05,137
Not with me.

128
00:12:05,248 --> 00:12:07,478
You like to kill women,
Mr. Regali?

129
00:12:07,584 --> 00:12:10,212
You may think
you can get away with it...

130
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,015
but that's not going
to happen.

131
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:14,454
Like I said...

132
00:12:14,558 --> 00:12:16,924
you really don't know
what you're dealing with.

133
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,393
I think we do.

134
00:12:19,496 --> 00:12:21,987
[Soft Chuckle]

135
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:27,868
Agent Dog... it.
Agent Reyes.

136
00:13:18,121 --> 00:13:19,952
[Sighs]

137
00:14:07,837 --> 00:14:09,805
How long you been
standing there?

138
00:14:09,906 --> 00:14:11,601
Not long.

139
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,406
I'm glad you dropped by.

140
00:14:17,514 --> 00:14:19,141
Wanted to tell you...

141
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:21,376
we hit pay dirt
with your profile.

142
00:14:21,484 --> 00:14:24,317
No arrests yet,
but we're building our case.

143
00:14:24,421 --> 00:14:27,822
There's something else.

144
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:38,100
There's another case
I'd like you to take a look at.

145
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:45,201
Seven-year-old boy rides
his bike around the block.

146
00:14:45,308 --> 00:14:49,608
His mom's on the porch,
counting his laps.

147
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:54,009
He waves to her
every time he goes by...

148
00:14:54,117 --> 00:14:58,816
and after six laps,
he doesn't come back around.

149
00:15:00,156 --> 00:15:03,455
She goes looking for him.

150
00:15:05,462 --> 00:15:07,487
[Stifled Sob]

151
00:15:09,432 --> 00:15:14,301
She finds his bike
lying on the sidewalk.

152
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:17,805
There's no witnesses...

153
00:15:17,907 --> 00:15:20,307
no ransom demands...

154
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:25,109
no clue as to
who took him or why.

155
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:28,184
The cops search door-to-door...

156
00:15:28,285 --> 00:15:30,276
block-to-block for two days.

157
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,912
Nothing. No news at all.

158
00:15:33,023 --> 00:15:35,583
And after three days...

159
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:38,923
they find him in a field.

160
00:15:58,515 --> 00:16:01,109
It's all in here.

161
00:16:01,217 --> 00:16:03,117
The particulars...

162
00:16:03,219 --> 00:16:06,052
about my son.

163
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:11,920
I've been over this
I don't know how many times...

164
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:16,465
but after nine years,
there's not a lot to go on.

165
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:20,298
You were such
a big help yesterday.

166
00:16:20,403 --> 00:16:23,099
If there's anything
you see here...

167
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:27,008
Agent Doggett...

168
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,977
that case I helped you
with yesterday?

169
00:16:32,148 --> 00:16:34,776
That <i>is</i> your son's.

170
00:16:56,606 --> 00:16:58,767
What is this?

171
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,672
Unsolved murders.

172
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:06,809
I started collecting them
before I came to the FBI.

173
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,111
I couldn't tell you why.

174
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:13,413
What do you do with these?

175
00:17:15,258 --> 00:17:17,954
If I sit with them...

176
00:17:18,061 --> 00:17:20,689
for a long time...

177
00:17:20,797 --> 00:17:23,994
very quietly...

178
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,660
they tell me things.

179
00:17:30,774 --> 00:17:33,402
It's how I see what I see.

180
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:41,143
You've been following
my son's case.

181
00:17:41,251 --> 00:17:43,845
For a long time.

182
00:17:45,422 --> 00:17:47,219
He calls to me.

183
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,592
Cadet...

184
00:17:54,697 --> 00:17:58,963
you should know there's
a real good chance you're nuts.

185
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:01,935
You recognize that man?

186
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:04,165
It's Bob Harvey.

187
00:18:04,274 --> 00:18:07,072
It's the closest we ever had
to a suspect.

188
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:09,202
He died.

189
00:18:09,312 --> 00:18:12,042
Killed in a car crash
last year in New Orleans.

190
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,578
<i>This</i> man killed my son?

191
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:17,346
He took him.

192
00:18:17,454 --> 00:18:20,150
He didn't kill him.

193
00:18:20,256 --> 00:18:23,714
Are you saying the same man
that killed those women...

194
00:18:23,827 --> 00:18:26,318
killed my son?

195
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:29,330
This guy Regali?

196
00:18:32,635 --> 00:18:33,570
<i>[Knocking]</i>

197
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,036
<i>[Knocking]</i>

198
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:36,867
[Doggett] Assistant Director?

199
00:18:36,973 --> 00:18:38,907
Can I have a minute?

200
00:18:39,008 --> 00:18:40,532
It's not a good time.

201
00:18:40,643 --> 00:18:43,009
I'm off to a meeting
with the Director.

202
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:44,443
This can't wait.

203
00:18:44,547 --> 00:18:47,380
And the Director can?

204
00:18:52,055 --> 00:18:54,387
Okay, you've got one minute.

205
00:18:56,726 --> 00:18:58,193
When you were in New York...

206
00:18:58,294 --> 00:19:00,660
you worked the organized crime
task force, right?

207
00:19:00,763 --> 00:19:01,855
Mm-hmm.

208
00:19:01,965 --> 00:19:04,525
Did you ever hear of a guy
named Nicholas Regali?

209
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:07,330
Yeah, he was...
a collector...

210
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,371
a low-level thug.

211
00:19:09,472 --> 00:19:11,599
Why are you asking,
Agent Doggett?

212
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:15,974
When the New York office was
investigating my son's death...

213
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,808
his name never came up.

214
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:20,314
Well, why would it?

215
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:25,283
You have reason to believe
he was involved?

216
00:19:25,388 --> 00:19:26,821
I've got no evidence...

217
00:19:26,923 --> 00:19:30,188
but somebody's telling me
he's mixed-up with the suspect...

218
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:32,591
in my son's kidnapping,
this Bob Harvey.

219
00:19:32,695 --> 00:19:35,186
Well, I never heard that.

220
00:19:35,298 --> 00:19:37,425
And I'm sure I'd remember.

221
00:19:43,273 --> 00:19:45,104
[Sighs]

222
00:19:47,043 --> 00:19:49,841
You want me to ask around
and pull some files?

223
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:57,510
I'll see what I can find.

224
00:19:58,955 --> 00:20:01,048
I'd appreciate it.

225
00:20:09,265 --> 00:20:11,460
[Reyes] John!

226
00:20:11,568 --> 00:20:14,093
Where you been?

227
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:15,670
Chasing down leads.

228
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:16,932
We were supposed to meet...

229
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,871
in the office
this morning, remember?

230
00:20:18,975 --> 00:20:21,967
To go over what
we have on Regali.

231
00:20:30,186 --> 00:20:31,744
I think this guy, Regali...

232
00:20:31,854 --> 00:20:34,345
may have been involved
in Luke's death.

233
00:20:34,457 --> 00:20:37,153
What? Since when?

234
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,023
Since I've been talking
to Cadet Hayes.

235
00:20:39,128 --> 00:20:40,993
He says Regali
knew Bob Harvey...

236
00:20:41,097 --> 00:20:43,657
that they were in
on it together.

237
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:45,700
How could he possibly
know <i>that?</i>

238
00:20:45,802 --> 00:20:48,066
How does he know half
the stuff he knows?

239
00:20:48,171 --> 00:20:50,071
I did some digging.

240
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:52,903
I found out that Bob
Harvey and Regali...

241
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:55,477
both did time at
Walkill in 1988.

242
00:20:55,578 --> 00:20:56,738
So did a thousand other men.

243
00:20:56,846 --> 00:20:58,507
That doesn't mean
they knew each other.

244
00:20:58,615 --> 00:21:01,846
I tracked Regali's
credit card use, Monica.

245
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:03,748
The day Luke disappeared...

246
00:21:03,853 --> 00:21:07,254
he gassed his car up
two miles from my house.

247
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:09,291
Regali is a New Yorker.

248
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:12,725
A lot of New Yorkers visit
Long Island.

249
00:21:12,829 --> 00:21:15,662
This is not evidence...

250
00:21:15,765 --> 00:21:17,858
not even close.

251
00:21:21,604 --> 00:21:25,506
I will never know how badly
it hurt you to lose your son...

252
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:27,872
or how much pain
you still carry.

253
00:21:27,977 --> 00:21:32,243
I understand how much
you want to find his killer...

254
00:21:32,348 --> 00:21:36,546
but I don't want
to see you disappointed.

255
00:21:36,653 --> 00:21:39,121
Not again.

256
00:21:39,222 --> 00:21:42,214
It's not going to happen.

257
00:21:42,325 --> 00:21:44,350
Not this time.

258
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,934
[Sighs]

259
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:09,576
Hi, Barbara.
How you doing?

260
00:22:21,531 --> 00:22:23,465
When'd you get
the new furniture?

261
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:25,329
Last year.

262
00:22:25,435 --> 00:22:27,767
I just wanted to make a change.

263
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:31,033
It looks great.

264
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,301
You look great.

265
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:35,468
You need to call first, John.

266
00:22:35,578 --> 00:22:39,070
It kind of throws me when
you just show up here.

267
00:22:39,182 --> 00:22:43,642
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

268
00:22:43,753 --> 00:22:46,313
I need to talk to you, Barb.

269
00:22:46,422 --> 00:22:48,947
It's about Luke.

270
00:22:49,058 --> 00:22:50,252
I got a suspect.

271
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:52,054
Oh, God. John...

272
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:54,959
I know, I know.
But this time, it's different.

273
00:22:55,064 --> 00:22:56,463
Is it?

274
00:22:56,566 --> 00:22:58,693
He <i>could</i> be,
he <i>might</i> be.

275
00:22:58,801 --> 00:23:04,262
I want to find out who did
this just as badly as you do.

276
00:23:04,373 --> 00:23:08,139
But I don't want you
coming over here again...

277
00:23:08,244 --> 00:23:10,144
bringing all this up...

278
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:12,908
unless you know...

279
00:23:13,015 --> 00:23:15,449
unless you absolutely know.

280
00:23:18,454 --> 00:23:21,821
That's what I thought.

281
00:23:21,924 --> 00:23:24,722
Look, this guy may have been
cruising the neighborhood.

282
00:23:24,827 --> 00:23:26,021
You could have seen him.

283
00:23:26,129 --> 00:23:30,361
Did you hear
<i>anything</i> I said?

284
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:38,732
[Woman] Agent Scully?

285
00:24:42,538 --> 00:24:44,699
I'm Barbara.
John's ex-wife.

286
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:45,967
Hi.

287
00:24:46,075 --> 00:24:48,407
I'm Dana.
Nice to meet you.

288
00:24:48,511 --> 00:24:49,739
He said you'd
be coming by.

289
00:24:49,846 --> 00:24:52,280
You weren't able to make
an identification?

290
00:24:52,381 --> 00:24:54,076
I didn't expect to.

291
00:24:55,818 --> 00:24:58,719
[Indecipherable Shouting]

292
00:24:58,821 --> 00:25:01,187
You know he doesn't
think clearly about this.

293
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,054
He can't.

294
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,390
He blames himself.

295
00:25:06,495 --> 00:25:09,555
He thinks he failed Luke.

296
00:25:09,665 --> 00:25:11,565
In his mind,
he can never do enough...

297
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:13,794
never suffer enough
for what happened.

298
00:25:13,903 --> 00:25:16,269
I think if you
could help him...

299
00:25:16,372 --> 00:25:18,397
find the man
who did this...

300
00:25:18,507 --> 00:25:21,943
maybe he could move on.

301
00:25:27,884 --> 00:25:30,250
He and Monica could
have something together.

302
00:25:30,353 --> 00:25:33,049
He just won't let her in.

303
00:25:38,928 --> 00:25:40,953
They're letting him go?

304
00:25:42,231 --> 00:25:44,131
For now.

305
00:25:44,233 --> 00:25:46,929
I'll be at my mom's
till tomorrow.

306
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,734
Tell me you
got something.

307
00:25:55,845 --> 00:26:00,748
As you asked, I compared
the wounds inflicted on your son...

308
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,148
with the wounds
on these two women.

309
00:26:03,252 --> 00:26:04,412
And?

310
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,953
There are similarities...

311
00:26:06,055 --> 00:26:08,080
between the trajectory
of the wounds...

312
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,091
and the force with which
they were delivered.

313
00:26:11,193 --> 00:26:12,990
Meaning Regali's the guy.

314
00:26:13,095 --> 00:26:17,122
Meaning that it was
a brilliant forensic deduction...

315
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:19,633
on Cadet Hayes's part.

316
00:26:19,735 --> 00:26:22,169
But that's all it is.

317
00:26:22,271 --> 00:26:24,637
The killer used
different weapons...

318
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,208
he demonstrated
no consistent M.O.

319
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:30,302
And no clear victimology.

320
00:26:30,413 --> 00:26:32,973
None of it will
hold up in court.

321
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,682
Well, something out there will.

322
00:27:56,532 --> 00:27:58,295
Something's not right.

323
00:27:58,401 --> 00:28:00,062
What do you mean?

324
00:28:01,737 --> 00:28:04,570
Here's a guy whose name
comes up in connection...

325
00:28:04,673 --> 00:28:07,836
with racketeering, prostitution,
drugs, even murder...

326
00:28:07,943 --> 00:28:10,935
yet all he's got are
nickel and dime convictions.

327
00:28:11,047 --> 00:28:13,777
Always gets off with
just a slap on the wrist.

328
00:28:13,883 --> 00:28:16,647
You know as well as I do
mob cases are hard to build.

329
00:28:16,752 --> 00:28:17,980
What I'm saying is...

330
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:20,555
I don't think
anyone's even trying.

331
00:28:20,656 --> 00:28:23,284
I think this guy Regali's
greasing somebody.

332
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,925
As in bribery?

333
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,430
What else could it be?

334
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:36,101
What? What is it?

335
00:28:38,574 --> 00:28:40,269
[Knocking]

336
00:28:43,712 --> 00:28:44,679
Agents.

337
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,645
I was just coming to see you.

338
00:28:46,749 --> 00:28:48,979
We need to talk to you,
Assistant Director.

339
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,014
About New York.

340
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:54,453
Oh, didn't you get
the case files?

341
00:28:54,557 --> 00:28:58,516
I mean when we were working in
the New York office. You and me.

342
00:29:00,229 --> 00:29:01,787
I'm not following.

343
00:29:05,568 --> 00:29:08,628
I used to get takeout
from a place on 11 th Street.

344
00:29:08,737 --> 00:29:10,136
A little
hole-in-the-wall.

345
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:11,433
Maybe you remember it.

346
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,134
Carlo's.

347
00:29:19,648 --> 00:29:23,414
Is it me, or, uh...

348
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:25,987
is this becoming
an odd conversation?

349
00:29:26,088 --> 00:29:30,650
One night, three years ago,
I'm waiting for my order.

350
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:32,989
I wandered toward
the kitchen.

351
00:29:35,664 --> 00:29:37,063
And I saw you.

352
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:38,565
Me?

353
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:40,862
Talking to a man.

354
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,666
A mob guy.

355
00:29:43,772 --> 00:29:46,434
I saw you take money
from him, Brad.

356
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:48,169
A stack of it.

357
00:29:48,277 --> 00:29:51,007
Three years ago?

358
00:29:54,817 --> 00:29:57,081
So, instead of asking
me to explain it...

359
00:29:57,186 --> 00:29:59,711
or even reporting me
to the Bureau...

360
00:29:59,822 --> 00:30:03,223
you broke off our relationship
and moved away?

361
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,826
I cared about you, Brad.

362
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:06,690
I'm not defending
my actions.

363
00:30:06,795 --> 00:30:09,559
And now you've come here because
you think I'm on the take.

364
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:13,595
Maybe I was on the take...

365
00:30:13,702 --> 00:30:15,693
when Agent Doggett's
son was murdered.

366
00:30:15,804 --> 00:30:17,999
Somebody gave Regali
inside help.

367
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,234
Covered his role
in my son's death.

368
00:30:25,314 --> 00:30:29,580
The man you saw me with
was a confidential informant.

369
00:30:29,685 --> 00:30:31,744
I was giving him the money.

370
00:30:31,854 --> 00:30:33,617
That's not what happened.

371
00:30:33,722 --> 00:30:35,917
We were buying his help
to infiltrate a crime family.

372
00:30:36,025 --> 00:30:39,085
It's all documented.
The entire operation.

373
00:30:40,863 --> 00:30:43,923
Now I can prove
what I'm saying.

374
00:30:44,033 --> 00:30:45,591
Can you?

375
00:30:53,542 --> 00:30:56,773
You should have
come to me, Monica.

376
00:30:58,814 --> 00:31:01,146
Especially given
what I know now.

377
00:31:08,724 --> 00:31:10,715
What do you know?

378
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:14,159
When you raised
concerns about Regali...

379
00:31:14,263 --> 00:31:16,823
I looked into the source
of these allegations...

380
00:31:16,932 --> 00:31:18,297
uh, a cadet, right?

381
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,492
Rudolph Hayes.

382
00:31:19,602 --> 00:31:20,899
He's been very helpful
in this investigation.

383
00:31:21,003 --> 00:31:26,942
Rudolph Hayes died in 1978
in a car accident.

384
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:29,135
What?
Let me see that.

385
00:31:29,245 --> 00:31:32,840
Cadet Hayes's real name
is Stuart Mimms...

386
00:31:32,948 --> 00:31:35,109
of Mendota, Minnesota.

387
00:31:35,217 --> 00:31:36,912
Last known residence...

388
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:39,749
the Dakota County
Psychiatric Facility.

389
00:31:39,855 --> 00:31:42,619
He was a mental patient?

390
00:31:42,725 --> 00:31:44,488
Diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic...

391
00:31:44,593 --> 00:31:46,788
voluntarily
institutionalized in 1990.

392
00:31:46,895 --> 00:31:50,160
In 1992, he checked himself out
and disappeared.

393
00:31:53,035 --> 00:31:54,935
There's another thing.

394
00:31:58,574 --> 00:32:03,204
We can also place him
in New York City in 1993...

395
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:06,645
the year your
son was murdered.

396
00:33:33,102 --> 00:33:35,468
Nice car.

397
00:33:35,571 --> 00:33:38,631
I remember when they had you
banging around...

398
00:33:38,741 --> 00:33:40,572
in a ten-year-old Impala.

399
00:33:40,676 --> 00:33:42,371
[Chuckles]

400
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:45,447
Now look at you.

401
00:33:45,547 --> 00:33:48,038
Mr. Assistant Director.

402
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:51,551
You got lucky.

403
00:33:51,653 --> 00:33:54,315
He has another suspect.

404
00:33:54,423 --> 00:33:58,257
You came down here
to tell me that?

405
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:03,559
There's something
I need to know.

406
00:34:03,665 --> 00:34:07,101
Were you in any way
involved...

407
00:34:07,202 --> 00:34:09,227
in the death of
John Doggett's son?

408
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:13,138
Since when
do you ask me questions?

409
00:34:13,242 --> 00:34:16,268
Were you involved?

410
00:34:18,781 --> 00:34:20,339
Course not.

411
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:26,184
What kind of guy
do you think I am?

412
00:34:32,094 --> 00:34:34,995
That's it, I'm done, Regali.

413
00:34:35,097 --> 00:34:36,860
Done?

414
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:39,866
With you, with this,
with this whole thing.

415
00:34:39,968 --> 00:34:43,995
And if I say no,
what are you going to do?

416
00:34:46,408 --> 00:34:49,775
You know, if I'm you,
right now I'm thinking...

417
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:51,675
"I could bop this guy right here...

418
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,374
and who's going to know
it's not self defense?"

419
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,552
Well, let me remind you...

420
00:34:58,654 --> 00:35:00,178
anything happens to me...

421
00:35:00,289 --> 00:35:03,224
a videotape lands
at the <i>Washington Post...</i>

422
00:35:03,325 --> 00:35:08,194
showing a young Brad Follmer
taking cash from yours truly...

423
00:35:08,297 --> 00:35:10,822
to make
an indictment go away.

424
00:35:16,171 --> 00:35:18,765
You're done
when I say you're done.

425
00:36:27,743 --> 00:36:29,768
It's all in there.

426
00:36:29,878 --> 00:36:32,745
How you defrauded the FBI
with a false identity...

427
00:36:32,848 --> 00:36:35,681
in order to gain admittance
to the Academy.

428
00:36:35,784 --> 00:36:38,048
We know who you really are.

429
00:36:38,153 --> 00:36:40,951
We know about your history
with schizophrenia.

430
00:36:41,056 --> 00:36:43,957
We know that you orchestrated
this entire thing...

431
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:46,459
in order to get close
to Agent Doggett.

432
00:36:46,562 --> 00:36:48,757
I've been recognized...

433
00:36:48,864 --> 00:36:51,799
by Agent Doggett's ex-wife...

434
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,061
who failed to identify...

435
00:36:54,169 --> 00:36:56,797
Nicholas Regali in that
same room yesterday.

436
00:36:56,905 --> 00:37:00,636
Because Nicholas Regali did
not kill Agent Doggett's son.

437
00:37:00,742 --> 00:37:02,141
You did.

438
00:37:02,244 --> 00:37:04,303
That's one explanation.

439
00:37:04,413 --> 00:37:05,573
It's <i>the</i> explanation.

440
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,149
No.

441
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,842
Then what is?

442
00:37:09,952 --> 00:37:10,976
What is?!

443
00:37:11,086 --> 00:37:13,782
I told you before, Agent Doggett.

444
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:16,722
I studied the photos
of your son's death.

445
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,158
They called to me.

446
00:37:21,263 --> 00:37:23,094
I don't know why...

447
00:37:23,198 --> 00:37:26,429
but it was a message,
and I listened.

448
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,504
And then you killed
Agent Doggett's son?

449
00:37:29,605 --> 00:37:32,904
I studied his case obsessively.

450
00:37:34,876 --> 00:37:36,036
I'm a schizophrenic.

451
00:37:36,144 --> 00:37:37,975
That's what schizophrenics do.

452
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,377
Obsess.

453
00:37:41,316 --> 00:37:43,614
I watched Agent Doggett.

454
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:47,246
I watched his ex-wife, too.

455
00:37:47,356 --> 00:37:50,120
She can't tell you
<i>how</i> she recognizes me...

456
00:37:50,225 --> 00:37:51,522
just that she does.

457
00:37:51,627 --> 00:37:54,027
You're a liar.
You lied to the FBI.

458
00:37:54,129 --> 00:37:55,289
You're lying now.

459
00:37:55,397 --> 00:37:58,366
Would you have listened
to me otherwise?

460
00:37:58,467 --> 00:38:02,096
A mental patient with insight
into your son's death?

461
00:38:02,204 --> 00:38:05,640
I wanted to get close
to you, Agent Doggett.

462
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,073
To help you.

463
00:38:08,176 --> 00:38:10,644
<i>You</i> gave me that tip.

464
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:15,774
To find the woman's body
in the wall.

465
00:38:15,884 --> 00:38:19,149
Regali associated with the man
who abducted your son.

466
00:38:19,254 --> 00:38:21,654
I called you...

467
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:24,385
so that you could catch him.

468
00:38:30,098 --> 00:38:32,293
I've received another message.

469
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:40,039
I'd like to go back home now
to the institution.

470
00:38:45,847 --> 00:38:47,075
John?

471
00:38:47,182 --> 00:38:48,911
John?

472
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:54,980
Well?

473
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:58,589
Well, he told us his story.

474
00:38:58,694 --> 00:39:00,184
Whether it's true...

475
00:39:00,295 --> 00:39:03,492
In other words,
we're nowhere. Again.

476
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:06,598
[Sighs]

477
00:39:31,126 --> 00:39:33,321
Well, well.
It's the FBI agent.

478
00:39:41,636 --> 00:39:44,127
I'm not here as an FBI agent.

479
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:46,230
I'm here as a father.

480
00:39:46,341 --> 00:39:48,901
Whoa. What could <i>that</i> mean?

481
00:39:49,044 --> 00:39:50,978
I want to know
what happened to my son.

482
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:53,377
I don't know
who killed your son.

483
00:39:56,318 --> 00:39:58,650
But I like you, FBI.

484
00:39:58,754 --> 00:40:00,585
I really do.

485
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:06,390
I'll tell you how it <i>could</i>
have happened, hypothetically.

486
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:12,527
Say there was this guy,
businessman.

487
00:40:12,634 --> 00:40:13,999
And say this businessman...

488
00:40:14,102 --> 00:40:15,865
in the course of
doing business...

489
00:40:15,971 --> 00:40:17,700
has to associate
with any number...

490
00:40:17,806 --> 00:40:21,469
of thugs, sickos, perverts.

491
00:40:21,576 --> 00:40:24,067
Like Bob Harvey, for example.

492
00:40:28,183 --> 00:40:30,743
And say this Bob Harvey likes
little boys.

493
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,445
Yeah.

494
00:40:33,555 --> 00:40:35,318
Disgusting.

495
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:39,719
Say one day,
Bob Harvey sees a little boy...

496
00:40:39,828 --> 00:40:41,659
riding a bike,
and he can't stand it.

497
00:40:41,763 --> 00:40:43,594
He grabs the boy.

498
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:47,767
So, Harvey takes
the boy back to his place...

499
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:48,995
only he doesn't tell...

500
00:40:49,104 --> 00:40:50,935
the businessman what he's doing.

501
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:54,702
So, the businessman
walks in on him.

502
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:57,506
You see what I'm saying, FBI?

503
00:40:57,612 --> 00:41:00,479
The boy sees
the businessman's face.

504
00:41:00,582 --> 00:41:04,109
The businessman who never did
<i>nothing</i> to this little boy.

505
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,552
That's a problem.

506
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:12,927
Well...

507
00:41:13,028 --> 00:41:16,725
every problem has got
a solution, right?

508
00:41:46,094 --> 00:41:47,959
[Gunshot]

509
00:41:54,769 --> 00:41:56,031
[Woman]
Oh, my God. He shot him.

510
00:41:56,137 --> 00:41:57,968
He just took out his gun
and shot him.

511
00:44:29,491 --> 00:44:31,391
<i>[Child]</i>
<i>I made this.</i>
