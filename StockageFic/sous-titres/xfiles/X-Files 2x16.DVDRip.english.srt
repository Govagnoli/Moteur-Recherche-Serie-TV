00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,629
<i>(Mulder) I have lived with a fragile faith</i>
<i>built on vague memories...</i>

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,032
<i>... from an experience that I could</i>
<i>neither prove nor explain.</i>

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,953
<i>When I was 12, my sister was taken from me.</i>

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,989
<i>Taken from our home by a force</i>
<i>that I came to believe was extraterrestrial.</i>

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,071
<i>This belief sustained me...</i>

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,278
<i>... fuelling a quest for truths</i>
<i>that were as elusive as the memory itself.</i>

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,272
<i>To believe so passionately</i>
<i>was not without sacrifice...</i>

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,396
<i>... but I always accepted the risks</i> -

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,156
<i>... to my career, my reputation,</i>
<i>my relationships, to life itself.</i>

10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,071
Easy.

11
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,117
He's an FBI agent. His name's Mulder.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,389
Come on, let's go!

13
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,636
Get a frostbite bay, stat!

14
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,915
Let's get ready, please!

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,311
- Basal temp's 86°
- Right eye dilated. Left eye dilated.

16
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,437
All right, let's get him into that tub
or we'll lose him.

17
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,715
On three. One, two, three.

18
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,709
- Agent Mulder was brought here tonight.
- This is an authorised area.

19
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,758
- I'm a federal agent.
- Hold on! We need to see some ID.

20
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,434
There is no time for this. A man is dying.

21
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,110
<i>What happened to me out on the ice</i>
<i>has justified every belief.</i>

22
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,318
<i>If I should die now, it will be with a certainty</i>
<i>that my faith has been righteous.</i>

23
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,516
<i>And if larger mysteries are revealed...</i>

24
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,593
<i>... I will already know the answer</i>
<i>to the question that has driven me here.</i>

25
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,070
<i>That there is intelligent life</i>
<i>in the universe other than our own.</i>

26
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,835
<i>That they are here among us.</i>
<i>And that they have begun to colonise.</i>

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,833
I'm Dana Scully, his partner.
What are his vitals?

28
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,435
- He's suffering from extreme hypothermia.
- No! Get him out of the tub.

29
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,274
- He's lost all his body heat.
- If you keep him in there, you'll kill him.

30
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,590
The cold is what's keeping him alive.

31
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,432
His heart stopped!

32
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,592
Get me one amp of epinephrine
and a cannula.

33
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,519
You gotta see this, Cap. We got a UFO
or something buzzing us. Right up here.

34
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,310
It's been up there for about 20 minutes.

35
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,437
- Could be a helicopter.
- Not the way it flew over us.

36
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,511
It's coming at us again.

37
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,911
It's gonna crash.

38
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,031
Reverse engine!

39
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,433
We're going after it.

40
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,911
<i>(TV) Two days ago, the crew of an ice cutter</i>
<i>thought they had seen a UFO...</i>

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,912
<i>... when a strange aircraft</i>
<i>plunged into the Beaufort Sea.</i>

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,278
<i>Later they recovered what is believed to be</i>
<i>a Russian fighter pilot from the water...</i>

43
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,194
<i>... where he miraculously survived</i>
<i>the extreme Arctic temperatures.</i>

44
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,717
<i>The man was airlifted to a hospital in Alaska,</i>
<i>where he was listed in stable condition.</i>

45
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,236
<i>But while authorities have been</i>
<i>trying to determine who he is...</i>

46
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,791
<i>... we've learned that he has walked out of</i>
<i>the hospital and is now listed as missing.</i>

47
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,030
<i>Reporting from our field office...</i>

48
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,996
- Where is he?
- Agh! I don't know.

49
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,351
<i>(alarm)</i>

50
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,158
- I've been looking for you.
- I was down the street.

51
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,834
Someone fired more shots
at the White House.

52
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,914
You gotta wonder when even the president
has to worry about drive-by shootings.

53
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,993
- What are you working on?
- I found these in my e-mail. Three obituaries.

54
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,559
Sent by whom?

55
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,871
- Obviously somebody that knows me.
- Why?

56
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,999
The deceased are Dr Landon Prince
of Scranton, Pennsylvania...

57
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,799
...Dr Dale Gayhart of New York City...

58
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,599
...and Dr Harvey Buchanon
of Tea Neck, New Jersey.

59
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,672
All worked in abortion clinics.
They died in arson fires.

60
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,911
- Sounds like militant right-to-lifers.
- Sounds like it.

61
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,879
- Why send them to you?
- It's taken me all morning to figure that out.

62
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,871
What'd you find?

63
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,794
This is the latest victim - Dr Landon Prince.

64
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,112
And these are the other two victims.
Drs Gayhart... and Buchanon.

65
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,997
- Triplets?
- Nope. I can't find any blood connection.

66
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,599
In fact, I can't find any records on them at all.
It's as if, before they died, they never existed.

67
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,477
What?

68
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,157
Dr Prince performed
legal clinical abortions...

69
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,391
...which has its own
occupational hazards these days.

70
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,277
You don't know any more about him?

71
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,318
He went about his work quietly.
No family's come forward.

72
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,960
What about the man you arrested?
This preacher?

73
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,795
Reverend Calvin Sistrunk. He's got a motive.
He's threatened these abortion docs before.

74
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,678
He was carrying this when we arrested him.

75
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,634
We're hoping for an indictment.

76
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,632
As soon as you locate Dr Prince's remains.

77
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,871
Yes. But that fact hasn't been released.

78
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,635
There have been two identical fire deaths.
Neither body's been found.

79
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,554
We're certain he was in the building.
His car was in the parking lot.

80
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,794
We found his keys where the fire was started.
He's been missing since the incident.

81
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,111
Could be we'll just be finding teeth and bone.

82
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,197
Good afternoon!

83
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,195
Reverend Sistrunk, these are Agents Scully
and Mulder. They want to ask you...

84
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,831
If Dr Prince burns in hell's fire
for his murder of the unborn?

85
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,195
If his damnation is God's will?

86
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,955
- Is that what you think, Reverend?
- I guess it's a question of opinion.

87
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,709
In my opinion, Dr Prince's killer
will be linked to two other murders.

88
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,109
How do you feel about that?

89
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,796
There are those who endorse the killing
of the heathen sinner in God's name.

90
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,518
But I am not one of them.

91
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,319
Have you been to New York
or New Jersey recently?

92
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,311
No, sir.

93
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,868
This clipping, where'd you get it?

94
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,710
From the newspaper. Obviously, more
of God's soldiers are seeking this man.

95
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,792
- Which newspaper?
- The local paper up in Binghamton.

96
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,796
Yeah, I remember this one.
The man who placed this paid cash.

97
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,678
- Would you recognise his face?
- Might.

98
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,119
No. That's not him.

99
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,671
- Do you have his name or address?
- No, we don't. He wouldn't sign anything.

100
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,274
In fact, he called to place
that ad a second week...

101
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,272
...so we did, but... he never came back to pay.

102
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,032
Thank you.

103
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,111
I've got a bad feeling about this case.

104
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,760
- What do you mean?
- Nothing about it makes sense.

105
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,879
We've got three deaths of identical victims.
No bodies, a non-suspect.

106
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,155
Sounds just like an X-File.

107
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,119
You don't know who sent you
that information. We've been set up before.

108
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,471
If we were being set up,
would we be given this little to go on?

109
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,439
There's something bigger here, Scully.
I'll bet there are more of these guys.

110
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,239
- More victims?
- Unless we get to them first.

111
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,313
The deaths follow a pattern.
New Jersey, New York, Scranton...

112
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,518
Then an ad is placed here in Binghamton
looking for a man exactly like the others.

113
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,672
The killer's moving in a northerly direction.

114
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,751
Uh... Excuse me.

115
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,308
Excuse me.

116
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,960
The number in the ad,
would that be a voice mail?

117
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,029
Yes.

118
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,796
- How would you access that?
- Well, you'd start by paying the bill.

119
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,033
Dial the number, then press 1236.

120
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,992
There's 24 messages responding to the ad.

121
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,875
First caller's seen the man
in the photo in Syracuse.

122
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,791
That's north.

His name is Dr Aaron Baker.
He's living in Syracuse.

We need you to sit on him

You got it. I'll call you back with an address

I said drop it!

Yes, sir.

There's two weeks' mail in the mailbox.

We may be too late.
We should take a look around anyway.

139
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,349
Not much to see.

140
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,070

- Send him right in.

141

- From?
- Syracuse.

143
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,239
- Where you were doing what?
- Agent Scully and I were following up a lead.

144
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,596
- Did anyone authorise this investigation?
- No, sir.

145
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,797
- Do you have paperwork on this case?
- No, sir.

146
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,792
We had an understanding
with respect to the X-Files.

147
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,759
Agent Mulder, the people I answer to
aren't quite so understanding.

148
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,752
Particularly when a field agent is found dead.

149
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,512
What?

150
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,239
Special Agent Barrett Weiss, Syracuse office.

151
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,677
His body was found in the trunk of a car
in front of a house that you sent him to.

152
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,752
It's impossible.
I spoke to Agent Weiss at the house.

153
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,516
Save it for your report! Until this matter is
cleared up, your butt and mine are in a sling!

154
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,434
And your investigation,
official or otherwise, is terminated.

155
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,879
Don't underestimate the seriousness of this,
Agent Mulder. A man is dead.

156
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,029

00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,272
I just wish I knew what the hell was going on.

163
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,236
- Have you checked your e-mail, Mulder?
- <i>No. Why?</i>

164
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,029
I received something unsettling
and I wondered if you'd gotten it, too.

165
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,079
- What is it?
- <i>It's a digitally-scanned photograph.</i>

166
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,233
<i>There's another one, Mulder.</i>
<i>His name is Dr James Dickens.</i>

167
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,833
- And, Mulder...
- <i>Yeah.</i>

168
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,115
He's right here in Washington.

169
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,397
Stay where you are, Scully. I'll pick you up.

170
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,395
Agent Mulder?

171
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,915
My name is Ambrose Chapel.

172
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,796
I work for the Central Intelligence Agency.

173
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,998
I need to talk to you about the case
you're working on.

174
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,596
- What case is that?
- The murder of certain identical victims.

175
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,639
I have a story to tell, Agent Mulder.
Believe me, you wanna hear it.

176
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,315
We've known of their existence for a decade.

177
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,755
We found out they were
in the country last year.

178
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,193
Who were they?

179
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,989
Vague intelligence reports
reveal that, early in the Cold War...

180
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:58,677
...Soviet scientists stumbled on a genetic
anomaly in sets of identical twins.

181
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:04,676
They isolated the DNA material that gave
the twins their facial features, hair colour...

182
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,399
...and they were able to reproduce it.

183
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,032
- Are you saying these men are clones?
- By all outward appearances.

184
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,115
How did they get here?

185
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,557
The programme went by the code name
"Gregor" - the name given to every clone.

186
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,077
We believe the original Gregor came here
in the mid-'70s on a German passport.

187
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:30,075
Using that same document, they were able
to bring a small cadre of clones in...

188
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,312
...several of which are in strategic positions
in the medical establishment.

189
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,719
For what purpose?

190
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,430
In the event of war, they would
mobilise simultaneously across the US...

191
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,116
...to contaminate blood supplies,
sabotage pharmaceutical factories.

192
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,317
Essentially, destroy
the country's immune system.

193
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,029
If you've known about this for a year,
why hasn't anything been done?

194
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,556
Well, this is where the story gets
perhaps even more incredible.

195
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,997
Secretly, someone is allowing the Gregors
to be systematically eliminated...

196
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,595
...by a man who I believe
is a Russian spy-killer...

197
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,070
...in exchange for the suppression
of the programme's existence...

198
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,072
...and to obtain the science that created it.

199
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,071
What's your business in this?

200
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,119
We share similar sentiments
on our government's policies of denial...

201
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,839
...which is why they've been
trying to contact you.

202
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,229
- Who?
- The Gregors.

203
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:27,080
You're obviously someone who might protect
them and bring these misdeeds to light.

204
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,069
What makes you think we've been contacted?

205
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,833
Your inquiries into their deaths.

206
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,913
And your response to the ad I placed.

207
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,112
We're talking state-sanctioned murder.

208
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,909
If we can find them first,
maybe the truth can be known.

209
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,033
We know where one of these men may be.

210
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,191
OK, let's go.

211
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,151
<i>(knocking)</i>

212
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,476
- Who is it?
- Agents Scully and Mulder.

213
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,755
We're with the FBI.

214
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,194
- Dr Dickens?
- Yes.

215
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,158
I believe you've been trying to contact us.

216
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,231
Uh...

217
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,278
- May we come in, Dr Dickens?
- Uh...

218
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,836
It's OK, sir. There's nothing to be afraid of.

219
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,676
I'll call the paramedics.

220
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,430
He's moving.

221
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,159
He's getting up!

222
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,236
I'll call you back.

223
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,792
- You OK?
- OK.

224
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,872
I just got the wind knocked out of me.
Don't lose him!

225
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,951
- Go!
- OK.

226
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,432
Oh...

227
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,159
He's gone.

228
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,276
- Where?
- He blindsided me.

229
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,715
Went up the fire escape
before I could grab him.

230
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,270
I'm gonna go see if I can
find a way up on the roof.

231
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,758
- How are you feeling?
- Like I should have used the crosswalk.

232
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,956
A lot better than my phone.

233
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,909
Maybe we should have dropped this case.

234
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,518
Scully, if our friend from the CIA is right,
this is a big national security conspiracy.

235
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,195
Our friend from the CIA is
about as unbelievable as his story.

236
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,750
As is everything about this case.
What happened to "Trust no one", Mulder?

237
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,638
I changed it to "Trust everyone."
I didn't tell you(?)

238
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,870
I ran a full background check on this guy.

239
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:25,956
Ambrose Chapel is a 17-year veteran, special
intelligence clearance. He's the real thing.

240
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,034
Why would a man with his experience
need our help?

241
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,511
And how could he let a man that he's been
looking so hard for slip away so easily?

242
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,388
That doctor wasn't running away
from us, Mulder, but Agent Chapel.

243
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,234
- I think you're being overly paranoid, Scully.
- Paranoid.

244
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,756
Maybe it was Agent Chapel
who killed that field agent in Syracuse.

245
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,719
Shall I put that on my report to Skinner?
I'd be happy for you to explain it to him.

246
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,791
Dammit, Mulder, that is not my job.

247
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,758
You'll pursue a case to the point of insanity...

248
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,515
...and expect me to follow you.
There has to be somewhere to draw the line.

249
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,593
Three identical men are dead. A fourth
identical man is alive and on the lam.

250
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,468
If this case seems like insanity to you,
feel free to step away from it.

251
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,915
An FBI agent died because of this case.

252
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,118
Those are the risks we take.
You either accept them or you don't.

253
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,158
We all draw our own lines.

254
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,155
I have to show you something.

255
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,274
I got these a week ago.

256
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,194
I stepped in something last night
that ate clean through the sole.

257
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:40,355
Maybe I'm paranoid, but it was in the exact
spot where Chapel said the doctor escaped.

258
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,678
Why don't you send it
to our lab guys for analysis?

259
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,991
- And arrange for an autopsy bay.
- An autopsy bay?

260
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,039
Putting together my report for Skinner,
I found something you'll appreciate.

261
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:58,434
Whoever killed that agent in Syracuse was so
clever, no clear cause of death can be found.

262
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,914
No penetrating knife or gunshot wounds.

263
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,276
No ligature marks
or abrasions from strangulation.

264
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,396
The toxicological is clean.

265
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,034
- And the blood work... Well, it's strange.
- Strange how?

266
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,272
There's evidence of polycythaemia -
excessive production of red blood cells.

267
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,555
- How excessive?
- Extremely.

268
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,110
The doctor has it in here
that the blood was curdled like jelly.

269
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,273
As if something caused the blood
to thicken or clot prior to death.

270
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,429
Due to what?

271
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,469
Possibly a coagulating agent, but it would
have shown up on the toxicological.

272
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:37,475
Didn't Agent Chapel say these doctors
could contaminate the blood supply?

273
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,395
Couldn't one of those contaminants
have been used to kill this man?

274
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,994
I don't know, Mulder. I...

275
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,310
There was a doctor's bag I took
as evidence from the apartment.

276
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,628
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah.

277
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,508
- Assistant Director Skinner's looking for you.
- I'll be right there.

278
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,478
Check the bag. See if you
find anything that connects.

279
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,997
Skinner's gonna want to know why you didn't
file your report. What are you gonna say?

280
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,548
Just the truth. I got hit by a car.

281
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,314
I'm sorry this is late. I had trouble with...

282
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,710
That's not why I called you in here,
Agent Mulder.

283
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:25,238
Your father's been trying to reach you.
There's been a family emergency.

284
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,390
Thank you.

285
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,318
<i>Hello?</i>

286
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,358
- Mom?
- <i>Fox, is that you?</i>

287
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,196
Yeah, I... I didn't expect you to answer.
Why are you at Dad's?

288
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,272
- Is he all right?
- <i>Yes. Let me put him on.</i>

289
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,191
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Dad?

290
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,435
I got a message there was
a family emergency.

291
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,674
<i>Yes, I received a very strange phone call</i>
<i>this afternoon. I called your mother.</i>

292
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,115
<i>We think you should come here</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

293
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,193
- Can you tell me what this is about?
- <i>I'll know more when you get here.</i>

294
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,795
I didn't find anything much to go on,
but we've got an address.

295
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,552
Check it out.

296
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,438
- Where are you going?
- Home.

297
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,637
<i>(tyres screeching)</i>

298
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,668
<i>This is Fox Mulder. Leave a message.</i>
<i>I'll get back to you as soon as I can.</i>

299
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,877
Mulder, it's me.
I need to talk to you immediately.

300
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,633
I've got some new information on this case.

301
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,711
Mulder, I think I'm in danger.

302
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,395
I'm in my apartment
and I think I've been followed.

303
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,670
Your mother needs some time.

304
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,310
You said it was an emergency.

305
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,834
She wanted you to come.

306
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,596
It's a difficult time. I appreciate
you coming at such short notice.

307
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,955
What is it, Dad?

308
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:47,399
The certainty... becomes
a comfort that allows you to move on.

309
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,556
We bury our memories so deep
after all that has been destroyed...

310
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,676
...never expecting...

311
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,876
Who is Mom talking to?

312
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,590
Your sister.

313
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,513
Fox.

314
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,554
After all those sleepless nights,
now I can hardly keep my eyes open.

315
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,756
You're exhausted.

316
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,308
We all are. It's after 5.30.

317
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,274
Oh, I just need a couple of hours.

318
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,110
Try to get some sleep.

319
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,479
- Fox...
- Yeah, Mom?

320
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,270
It is really her.

321
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,351
Isn't it?

322
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,394
I don't see who else it could be.

323
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,075
Go on, go to sleep.

324
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,600
Is it too late for a game of Stratego?

325
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,315
It's 22 years too late.

326
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,476
I don't think Dad could think of
anything to say. He just sat here.

327
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,955
So much has happened.

328
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,749
Where do you begin?

329
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,790
I must have been nine or ten
when I was returned.

330
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,471
I had no memory.

331
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,314
I was placed with a family
who raised me as a daughter.

332
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,314
Who were they?

333
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,518
I knew they weren't my parents,
but I didn't remember Mom or Dad.

334
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,591
Or you.

335
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,155
But you came to remember... us.

336
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,753
I started having trouble several years ago.

337
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,116
It was diagnosed as free-floating anxiety.

338
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,158
Nothing worked for me. I hit rock bottom.

339
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,395
Until I underwent regression hypnotherapy.

340
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,709
And it all started coming back.

341
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,468
The abductions...

342
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,551
The tests...

343
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,029
I'm in danger, Fox.

344
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,633
- What do you mean?
- You've been contacted.

345
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,395
You know there's a man hunting
my father and the other doctors.

346
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,677
Your f... Your father.

347
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,068
My adoptive parents.
They're only visitors here.

348
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,793
What people would call aliens.

349
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,752
A bounty hunter's been sent to kill them.
You've met this man.

350
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,389
His lies to you have caused
others like my father to die.

351
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,869
He won't stop until he's killed them all...

352
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,428
...and anyone who tries to stop him.

353
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,956
He'll come for me soon.

354
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,231
<i>(phone rings)</i>

355
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:53,157
<i>This is Dana Scully. Please leave a message</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.</i>

356
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,038
Scully, it's Mulder. Pick up the phone.

357
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,918
If you're screening, pick up the phone.
I need to talk to you.

358
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,633
Do not, under any circumstances,
trust the CIA agent.

359
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,518
Your life may be in danger. Now call me.

360
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,832
She may not be able to recognise him.
He has the ability to disguise himself.

361
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,718
- Disguise himself? How?
- As anyone.

362
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,156
- As anyone? You gotta be kidding.
- No.

363
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,708
You can't recognise him, but I can.

364
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,509
<i>Hello, this is Fox Mulder.</i>
<i>Leave a message, please.</i>

365
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,991
Mulder, it's me. I've left my apartment
and I don't think I've been followed.

366
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:29,676
I'll be staying at the Vacation Village
Motorlodge off the l-90 in Germantown.

367
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,392
When you reach me, I should have some very
important information regarding this case.

368
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,514
Wait!

369
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,554
Stop! Federal agent!

370
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,189
Put your hands against the wall!

371
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,794
- Do it!
- You won't shoot me.

372
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,354
Put your hands against the wall.

373
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,431
Now!

374
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,589
You cannot harm us.

375
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,271
Sir?

376
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,189
It's all right.

377
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:57,149
We are the last remaining.
Unless you protect us, we are already dead.

378
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,833
Put them in maximum-security
protective custody.

379
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,673
No visitors, no press, no anybody.

380
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,354
- OK?
- Yeah.

381
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,000
Can I ask? Who are these guys?

382
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,072
I'll let you know when I figure it out myself.

383

<i>(answerphone) I should have some very</i>
<i>important information regarding this case.</i>

384

- <i>Vacation Village.</i>
- I need to speak to Dana Scully, please.

385
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,510
Just a moment.

386
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,953

<i>registered by that name.</i>

387
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,555
All right, I need her to call Fox Mulder
as soon as she checks in.

388
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,949
- Fox Mulder.
- <i>Fox Mulder.</i>

389
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,918
- Yes.
- Will do.

390
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,950
Who's this message for?

391
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:21,119
- I'd like a single for one night, please.
- Ah! See what I got.

- Mine, sir. We're on changeover.

394
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,475
I'm gonna talk to the prisoners.

395
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,240
You wanna get me a coffee?
Sugar and milk, no cream.

396
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,551
- Do you want me to keep an eye open?
- No, just get me the coffee.

397
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,631
Yes, sir.
