1
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:47,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here, let me do it.

2
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:51,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Putyour number in,
then your card.

3
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:54,326  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's your number, Roland?

4
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:56,733  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Three fifteen.

5
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:03,772  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
See how easy it is?

6
00:01:10,317 --> 00:01:11,978  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Engine efficiency?

7
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:14,577  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Ninety-four percent.
- We need more.

8
00:01:14,654 --> 00:01:16,986  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How's the back pressure holding?

9
00:01:17,057 --> 00:01:19,491  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What doyou think?
It's climbing.

10
00:01:19,593 --> 00:01:22,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Increase the blade inclination.
I said--

11
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:25,497  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The inclination ofthe blade
is pi over nine.

12
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:27,499  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We've reached maximum velocity.

13
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:29,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No!

14
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:31,936  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let it go!
It will work.

15
00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:35,168  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It will destroy itself!.
I'm not going to do that.

16
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:37,335  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's not going to
destroy itself.

17
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:39,345  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on!
We're almost there!

18
00:01:39,413 --> 00:01:41,176  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Our equations are wrong.

19
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:44,445  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What happened?
- Nothing. He pulled the plug.

20
00:01:44,518 --> 00:01:47,612  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm just protecting the baby--
and fouryears ofwork.

21
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:50,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fouryears that add up to zilch.

22
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,986  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Unless we show some progress...

23
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:56,028  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
they're going to pull
the plug on us, Ron.

24
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:01,133  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You should have
continued with the test.

25
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:03,066  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Somebody's going
to crack Mach 1 5...

26
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,400  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and I want it to be us.

27
00:02:05,472 --> 00:02:08,407  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I won'tjeopardize everything
becauseyou two...

28
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:10,409  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
can't wait to see
your name in print.

29
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:13,412  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's print that gets
the money, Ron.

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,416  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go down in fames together.
Fine, go ahead.

31
00:02:17,484 --> 00:02:19,418  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm going to do the math.

32
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:24,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good night, Dr. Keats.

33
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:14,769  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What the hell?

34
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:19,807  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland.

35
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Open the door.

36
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:25,808  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Open the door!

37
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:29,617  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland, I wantyou to listen
to me very carefully.

38
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:31,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We have to open
this door, Roland.

39
00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:34,526  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stop typing!
Roland!

40
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland, open the door!

41
00:03:53,547 --> 00:03:56,107  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What areyou doing?!

42
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:59,174  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Open the door!

43
00:03:59,252 --> 00:04:02,813  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland, hit escape.
Areyou listening?

44
00:04:58,378 --> 00:05:00,938  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(screaming)

45
00:05:01,014 --> 00:05:02,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(splat)

46
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:02,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How was the wedding?

47
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:04,242  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The part where the groom passed out...

48
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,244  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
or the dog bit the drummer?

49
00:06:06,312 --> 00:06:07,904  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Did you catch the bouquet?

50
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:09,573  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maybe.

51
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:12,243  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is that whatyou couldn't
talk about over the phone?

52
00:06:12,352 --> 00:06:15,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The project everyone says
doesn't exist does exist.

53
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:17,413  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The lcarus project?

54
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:19,617  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The next generation
injet engine design.

55
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:21,923  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Capable ofdoubling
current supersonic speeds...

56
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:25,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
using halfthe fuel,
at least, in theory.

57
00:06:25,665 --> 00:06:28,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And Ronald Surnow was
an aeronautical scientist...

58
00:06:28,835 --> 00:06:30,928  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
who worked on it
here at the university.

59
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:33,268  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Yes.
- How close are they?

60
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:35,933  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm not sure, but Surnow's
the second team scientist...

61
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:37,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to die in six months.

62
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:39,945  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But how is this an X file?

63
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:41,947  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mulder, you don't think...

64
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:44,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
this has anything to do
with U.F.O. technology?

65
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:46,208  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's something
unexplainable, Scully...

66
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,253  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but it's not unidentifiable.

67
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:56,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Keats?
- There.

68
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,764  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Dr. Keats?

69
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:00,766  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're with the F.B.I.

70
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:02,802  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm Agent Mulder.
This is Agent Scully.

71
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:05,667  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We understand you discovered
Dr. Surnow this morning.

72
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:07,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What was left ofhim.

73
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:13,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How doyou suppose he became
trapped in the wind tunnel?

74
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,647  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Someone must have shut him in.

75
00:07:16,716 --> 00:07:18,206  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
By computer?

76
00:07:18,284 --> 00:07:21,412  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We've already been through this
with the police.

77
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:23,455  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Another member ofyour team
died recently...

78
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:25,218  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
isn't that correct?

79
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes.

80
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:28,022  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Arthur Grable.

81
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:30,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He was killed in
an automobile accident in November.

82
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:33,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm Frank Nollette.
I'm also on the project.

83
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:36,001  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Areyou certain
it was an accident?

84
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:38,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What areyou driving at?

85
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:40,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yourwork seems to be...

86
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:42,934  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
a perfect target
for industrial espionage.

87
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who wrote this?

88
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:54,044  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ron was working on it
when I left.

89
00:07:54,154 --> 00:07:56,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The handwriting here...

90
00:07:56,422 --> 00:07:58,890  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
doesn't match
other handwriting on the board.

91
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:01,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It isn't mine.

92
00:08:05,398 --> 00:08:07,332  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What about Roland Fuller?

93
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,699  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Uh... Roland's the, uh...janitor.

94
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,704  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
According to the police...

95
00:08:12,772 --> 00:08:14,706  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
he was the only other person here.

96
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:17,004  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland didn't do that.

97
00:08:17,076 --> 00:08:19,010  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How doyou know?

98
00:08:19,078 --> 00:08:22,570  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let'sjust say Roland isn't
exactly a rocket scientist.

99
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:37,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here.

100
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:40,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
"Tracy."

101
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,134  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- (giggles)
- With stars.

102
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:46,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Woman: Roland.

103
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:48,607  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There are some people here
to talkwith you.

104
00:08:48,675 --> 00:08:51,610  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Uh-oh.

105
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:54,641  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I went offthe paper.

106
00:08:54,714 --> 00:08:56,978  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sorry.

107
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,017  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's all right, Roland.

108
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:00,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tracy?

109
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,786  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Would you help me in the TV room?

110
00:09:02,856 --> 00:09:04,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Okay.

111
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:10,494  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hi, Roland.
Mind ifwe sit down?

112
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:12,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thanks.

113
00:09:12,632 --> 00:09:15,260  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mind ifwe askyou
a couple questions?

114
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:19,168  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Doyou rememberworking
last night?

115
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:21,298  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Uh-huh.

116
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:23,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Doyou remember seeing
anything unusual?

117
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:26,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Seeing any strangers?

118
00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:33,652  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Did Dr. Surnow or Dr. Keats
or Dr. Nollette...

119
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,779  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
do anything unusual?

120
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:38,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nope.

121
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:45,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You must like stars.

122
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:48,160  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
One hundred and forty-seven.

123
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:49,826  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sorry?

124
00:09:49,903 --> 00:09:52,337  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stars.

125
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:01,604  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You like numbers, too, huh?

126
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:20,692  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland, let me helpyou.

127
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:23,702  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
One, two, three...

128
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:27,331  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
four, five...

129
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:28,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
six, seven, eight...

130
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:32,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland? ls everything okay?

131
00:10:32,912 --> 00:10:35,142  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland, areyou all right?

132
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:36,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Eleven...

133
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,884  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
twelve, thirteen...

134
00:10:38,952 --> 00:10:40,886  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What happened?

135
00:10:40,954 --> 00:10:43,252  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What did you say
to upset him so?

136
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:45,883  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sixteen, seventeen...

137
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:53,929  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's definitely the work
ofa fourth individual.

138
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,935  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Surnow's, Keats' and Nollette's
cursive standards...

139
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:59,267  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
don't match whatyou found
on the white board.

140
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Will you do me a favor
and try this?

141
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:03,206  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What is it?

142
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:05,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Something Roland
doodled at the home.

143
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:08,407  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You don't really think Roland...

144
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:10,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He was the only other person
in the lab.

145
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,484  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, but we're talking...

146
00:11:12,552 --> 00:11:14,986  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
about a sophisticated
fuid dynamics equation.

147
00:11:15,054 --> 00:11:17,045  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland barely has an l.Q of70.

148
00:11:17,156 --> 00:11:19,420  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You saw his facility
with mathematics.

149
00:11:19,492 --> 00:11:22,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Some autistic individuals
display unusual abilities.

150
00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:24,362  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, but even savants...

151
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,523  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
behave only as human calculators.

152
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,726  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They can perform
certain functions...

153
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:30,735  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but they can't tell
the value ofanything...

154
00:11:30,803 --> 00:11:32,862  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
or the meaning ofa number.

155
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:35,567  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I hate to take sides,
but the bottom line is no.

156
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:40,544  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The terminal stroke on the six,
the roofon the five...

157
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:42,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm sorry.
He didn't write it.

158
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:48,420  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(gasping)

159
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:55,284  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(grunting)

160
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(loud music from earphones)

161
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:34,824  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(beeping)

162
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:36,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(door clicks)

163
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:31,286  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(screaming)

164
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:53,407  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(shattering)

165
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:58,413  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(crunching)

166
00:14:00,887 --> 00:14:03,412  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(typing)

167
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:09,827  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Scully: An organic object,
exposed to liquid nitrogen...

168
00:14:09,896 --> 00:14:11,830  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
will become frozen...

169
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:13,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
exhibiting great tensile strength...

170
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,336  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but is vulnerable to stress
from compression or impact.

171
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:20,338  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now, I've seen this
demonstrated on a fish before...

172
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:22,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't think
they'll be performing...

173
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,411  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
this experiment on Beakman's World.

174
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:28,413  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Has this been dusted?

175
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:30,415  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Treatyourself.

176
00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:32,417  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thanks.

177
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:40,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, Scully,
look at these files.

178
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,125  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
" KMAN" must be Keats.

179
00:14:44,197 --> 00:14:47,428  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
His file was turned off
at 1 2:31 last night.

180
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Scully: But look.
Someone else entered a file...

181
00:14:50,503 --> 00:14:52,937  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
under the name "Arthur," after 1 2:31 .

182
00:14:53,005 --> 00:14:55,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And worked on it
for nearly five hours.

183
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,370  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, it couldn't
have been Keats.

184
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:00,378  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
judging from the rigor ofthe body...

185
00:15:00,446 --> 00:15:02,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
he was dead around 1 2:30.

186
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:04,812  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're saying someone came in here,
killed Keats...

187
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:08,320  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and worked on
an old Grable file?

188
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:15,520  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can't access the Arthur file.

189
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:18,028  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're going to need
the password.

190
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:21,066  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Try 1 5626.

191
00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:33,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How did you know that
that was..?

192
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:35,480  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is Arthur Grable's work...

193
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:37,778  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
on the same fuid dynamics equations...

194
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,784  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
the others were working on.

195
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:42,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look at all those entries.

196
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:46,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Someone has been continuing
his work since he died.

197
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:50,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How did you know
what the password was?

198
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:02,173  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Woman:
Wave good-bye. Wave good-bye.

199
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:05,934  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(child crying)

200
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:08,173  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Say good-bye. Bye-bye.

201
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:13,015  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wave good-bye.

202
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:16,821  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(door opening)

203
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:18,856  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland?

204
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,328  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why did you sleep
in your clothes?

205
00:16:26,232 --> 00:16:28,166  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, let's getyou dressed.

206
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:30,725  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You have visitors.

207
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:42,376  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm not supposed
to talk to them.

208
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:44,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who told you that?

209
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:52,387  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Remember that talkwe had
about being shy?

210
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:54,686  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
These are nice people, Roland.

211
00:17:04,804 --> 00:17:07,068  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, Roland, you have
more shirts than I do.

212
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:09,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I think this one would
look stylin' today.

213
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:11,041  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What doyou think?

214
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,544  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- The green one.
- Green one?

215
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:15,546  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Please.

216
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:17,548  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mrs. Stodie...

217
00:17:17,616 --> 00:17:19,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
can I talk toyou a second?

218
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:21,745  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Seeyou later, Roland.

219
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:26,048  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This one?

220
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:28,388  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hereyou go.

221
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:30,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Soyou likeyourjob
at the college, Roland?

222
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,094  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes.

223
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:35,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I hearyou're
very good at it.

224
00:17:37,002 --> 00:17:39,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Doyou remember
howyou gotyourjob?

225
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A man talked to Mrs. Stodie.

226
00:17:42,942 --> 00:17:44,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What man?

227
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:48,003  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Dr. Grable.

228
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,243  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Was Dr. Grable nice toyou?

229
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:53,615  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes.

230
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:56,621  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
When was the last time
you spoke to him?

231
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:03,459  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Last week?
Day before?

232
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:05,827  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Dr. Grable died.

233
00:18:08,968 --> 00:18:10,902  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm sorry.

234
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,904  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes.

235
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,200  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
People die.

236
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:20,211  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They go away...

237
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:23,214  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and they're not supposed
to come back.

238
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:28,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Has Roland ever mentioned
the name "Arthur"?

239
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:30,722  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That was Dr. Grable's first name..

240
00:18:30,823 --> 00:18:34,020  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but we only called him
Dr. Grable.

241
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:37,061  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I doubt Roland even knew
his first name was Arthur.

242
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:39,063  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Scully:
Mrs. Stodie, can I get a copy...

243
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:41,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
of Roland's file
and past history?

244
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Our histories are confidential.

245
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:44,364  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I understand...

246
00:18:44,437 --> 00:18:46,371  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but I have grounds
to obtain them.

247
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:48,373  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The less time we spend in court...

248
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:50,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
the more time we have
to help Roland.

249
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:53,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland Fullerwas hired
byArthur Grable.

250
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:54,909  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He went to the halfway house...

251
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
specifically to find
a mentally challenged person.

252
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:59,083  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Areyou suggesting...

253
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:02,382  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Arthur Grable hired Roland
to use him?

254
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:05,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Areyou suggesting
Arthur Grable is not dead?

255
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:08,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ifhe had intentions ofkilling
Nollette, Keats, and Surnow...

256
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:11,388  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
why not set it up to appear
the least likely suspect?

257
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:15,524  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah, but by the look ofthis,
he's hamburger.

258
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:17,694  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maybe he staged it.

259
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:21,206  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That would explain why his work
is continuing on...

260
00:19:21,273 --> 00:19:23,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
six months after his death.

261
00:19:23,742 --> 00:19:26,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This obituary says Arthur Grable
was born in Seattle.

262
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:28,846  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
His fatherwas a big banker.

263
00:19:28,914 --> 00:19:31,508  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
His motherwas active
in a number ofcharities.

264
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:33,017  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Only child.

265
00:19:33,085 --> 00:19:35,019  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Summa cum laude in physics.

266
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:37,021  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Doctoral and postdoctoral...

267
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:39,819  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
in aeronautical engineering
at Harvey Mudd.

268
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:43,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Brilliant future,
tragically cut short.

269
00:19:43,229 --> 00:19:45,697  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland's also from Seattle.

270
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:48,733  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He spent most ofhis life
at the Heritage Halfway House.

271
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:51,702  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The identity ofhis parents
has been sealed.

272
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,365  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's no information
on Roland before age three...

273
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:57,375  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
when he was put in the program.

274
00:19:57,443 --> 00:19:59,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Does it saywhen he was born?

275
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:03,940  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
july 1 5, 1 952.

276
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:12,416  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's also Arthur's birth date.

277
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:25,303  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don'tyou wish you could fy?

278
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:27,464  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can.

279
00:20:28,874 --> 00:20:30,808  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
When I dream.

280
00:20:32,711 --> 00:20:35,942  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
People can do anything
in a dream, you know.

281
00:20:38,517 --> 00:20:44,285  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Once, one time,
I had a dream we were married...

282
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,881  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and lived in a house.

283
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:52,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Doyou have dreams, Roland?

284
00:21:01,473 --> 00:21:04,169  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You can tell me.

285
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:06,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland?

286
00:21:07,146 --> 00:21:10,081  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who's Arthur?

287
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:22,057  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm sorry, Roland.

288
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:24,687  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm sorry.

289
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:32,103  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland?

290
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:37,708  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland?

291
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:39,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go away!

292
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:45,983  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland, what's the matter?

293
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:47,985  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go away!

294
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:50,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't want to hurtyou!

295
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:54,087  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go away!

296
00:21:58,497 --> 00:22:00,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go away.

297
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:06,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mulder: ls thatyou?

298
00:22:06,338 --> 00:22:08,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nollette: Yes.

299
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:10,604  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's the story here?

300
00:22:10,709 --> 00:22:13,644  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(sighs)

301
00:22:13,712 --> 00:22:17,648  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Um... a quantum physics
professor ofmine...

302
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:20,014  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
at Harvey Mudd funked me.

303
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:23,384  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He challenged the tenets
ofone ofmy theories--

304
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:25,889  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
a theory I later published in Nature.

305
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:28,449  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Anyway, to get back at him...

306
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:31,655  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
one afternoon,
we decided to take his car apart...

307
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,164  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and put it back together
again in his office...

308
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:36,167  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and left it running.

309
00:22:36,235 --> 00:22:38,169  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
An egghead classic.

310
00:22:38,237 --> 00:22:40,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It was Grable's idea.

311
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:42,370  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Scully:
ls that Grable on the chair?

312
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:43,703  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah.

313
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:45,538  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Was he a practical joker?

314
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:47,578  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Atop ofall his brilliance...

315
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:50,046  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
he had a genius for
executing elaborate schemes.

316
00:22:50,115 --> 00:22:52,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Could he be making it seem
like a man with a 70 l.Q..

317
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:55,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
is gaining access to and operating...

318
00:22:55,554 --> 00:22:57,488  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
his old computer files?

319
00:22:57,556 --> 00:23:02,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Arthurwould still
have to be alive.

320
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:04,662  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Could he have faked
his own death?

321
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:05,662  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No.

322
00:23:05,731 --> 00:23:07,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The police report
on the auto accident...

323
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:09,667  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
that killed Grable
is woefully incomplete.

324
00:23:09,735 --> 00:23:12,499  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A dry road surface,
no mechanical problems found.

325
00:23:12,571 --> 00:23:14,505  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The bodywas never admitted
to a county morgue...

326
00:23:14,573 --> 00:23:16,666  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and there was no funeral.

327
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:20,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ifyou are trying to suggest...

328
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:24,647  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
that Arthur Grable
killed Surnow and Keats...

329
00:23:24,717 --> 00:23:27,686  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and is after me next,
you're way off.

330
00:23:29,254 --> 00:23:31,779  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Art could not have done the murders.

331
00:23:31,857 --> 00:23:34,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How can you be so certain?

332
00:23:38,097 --> 00:23:40,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Man:
This is Arthur Grable.

333
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:42,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Because ofthe massive internal damage
to his body...

334
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:45,532  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
caused by the car accident,
we could only preserve the head.

335
00:23:45,604 --> 00:23:48,698  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wouldn'tyour client
find it inconvenient...

336
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:50,867  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to be thawed out, only to discover...

337
00:23:50,976 --> 00:23:53,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
he had no functional mobility?

338
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:55,409  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We believe that, by the time
science figures a way...

339
00:23:55,481 --> 00:23:57,415  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to revive our clients...

340
00:23:57,483 --> 00:23:59,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You'll also know how
to clone new bodies.

341
00:23:59,985 --> 00:24:01,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Exactly.

342
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:03,521  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This technology is progressing faster...

343
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:05,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
than anyone thought possible.

344
00:24:05,424 --> 00:24:07,324  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ask anyone here
at the university.

345
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:09,451  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So, while for us,
the passing ofeach second...

346
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:11,462  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
brings our bodies closer to death...

347
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:14,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
for our clients,
it brings them closer to life.

348
00:24:16,502 --> 00:24:18,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
These fuctuations in temperature--

349
00:24:18,504 --> 00:24:20,495  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do they happen often?

350
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:22,972  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No. We've had some problems
with this capsule.

351
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:25,009  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Our technicians
have checked it...

352
00:24:25,077 --> 00:24:27,011  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but they've found nothing.

353
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:29,547  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Could the brain
cause the fuctuations?

354
00:24:29,648 --> 00:24:33,209  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, but we are looking
for the explanation.

355
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:35,219  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The patient's in no danger.

356
00:24:35,287 --> 00:24:37,221  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He remains perfectly preserved...

357
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:39,382  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
as long as there's liquid nitrogen
in the capsule.

358
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,688  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maywe take a look
at Arthur Grable's records?

359
00:24:47,432 --> 00:24:49,366  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thankyou.

360
00:24:53,505 --> 00:24:55,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Dr. Barrington...

361
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
in the future,
what requirements will exist...

362
00:24:57,576 --> 00:24:59,806  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to be an organ or tissue donor?

363
00:24:59,912 --> 00:25:01,777  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Same requirements
as there are today.

364
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:03,781  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Compatible genetic makeup.

365
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:06,841  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's best ifthe donor's related.

366
00:25:08,387 --> 00:25:10,321  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mulder...

367
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:15,859  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Arthur Grable put down
only one donor.

368
00:25:15,928 --> 00:25:20,126  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mulder: Roland Fuller and
Arthur Grable had the same birthday.

369
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:23,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I think they're twins.

370
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,704  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Older oryounger?

371
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:28,706  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Same age...

372
00:25:28,807 --> 00:25:30,741  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
just less hairy
and with better eyesight.

373
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:32,572  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And the moustache?

374
00:25:32,678 --> 00:25:34,737  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Scully:
No. Lose the whole beard.

375
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:41,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Next?

376
00:25:41,787 --> 00:25:43,379  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Close-cropped hair...

377
00:25:43,455 --> 00:25:46,185  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
with a slightly receding
widow's peak.

378
00:25:50,762 --> 00:25:52,423  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lose the glasses.

379
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:57,026  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's Roland.

380
00:25:57,102 --> 00:25:59,161  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Give or take a few pounds.

381
00:26:07,846 --> 00:26:10,781  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tell me aboutyour dreams, Roland.

382
00:26:16,355 --> 00:26:19,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's all right.
I won't tell anybody.

383
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:27,264  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know,
I had a dream last night.

384
00:26:28,901 --> 00:26:31,768  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I dreamt I was swimming
in this pool...

385
00:26:31,837 --> 00:26:35,773  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and I could see my father underwater...

386
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:39,742  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but when I dove down,
the water stung my eyes.

387
00:26:41,046 --> 00:26:45,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Then there was another man
at the pool, watching me.

388
00:26:46,018 --> 00:26:48,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He upset me.

389
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:53,924  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He was asking me questions
I didn't want to answer...

390
00:26:53,992 --> 00:26:55,926  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and I had to leave.

391
00:26:55,994 --> 00:26:58,462  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I couldn't find my father.

392
00:27:05,437 --> 00:27:08,406  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can't tell you my dreams.

393
00:27:08,473 --> 00:27:10,304  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why not?

394
00:27:15,113 --> 00:27:17,047  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bad.

395
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:23,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your dreams are bad, Roland...

396
00:27:23,255 --> 00:27:25,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
notyou.

397
00:27:25,257 --> 00:27:28,090  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're a good person.

398
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:34,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I hit Tracy.

399
00:27:39,004 --> 00:27:41,700  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your dreams makeyou hit Tracy?

400
00:28:12,704 --> 00:28:15,138  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know how to work
this toy, Roland?

401
00:28:16,808 --> 00:28:18,742  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here.

402
00:28:39,131 --> 00:28:42,532  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You see,
the wayyou work that toy...

403
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:44,694  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
is like what's happening toyou.

404
00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:49,040  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're the spaceship, Roland...

405
00:28:50,942 --> 00:28:53,206  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and your dreams
are the controls.

406
00:28:58,383 --> 00:29:00,248  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who...?

407
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,184  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who runs the controls?

408
00:29:09,261 --> 00:29:11,661  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Haveyou seen this man recently?

409
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:22,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Woman:
We have to say bye-bye to Roland.

410
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:30,012  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(screaming)

411
00:29:30,082 --> 00:29:31,208  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland.

412
00:29:31,283 --> 00:29:33,217  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland!

413
00:29:33,285 --> 00:29:35,583  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland, stop.

414
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:37,588  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland!

415
00:29:41,827 --> 00:29:43,852  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland!

416
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:49,098  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland?

417
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:52,261  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We need to keep
Roland under observation.

418
00:29:55,173 --> 00:29:57,164  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland?

419
00:29:57,275 --> 00:29:59,004  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(glass breaking)

420
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:02,547  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's trying to get away.

421
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:06,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland!

422
00:30:06,184 --> 00:30:08,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland!

423
00:30:23,768 --> 00:30:25,702  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nollette's gone.

424
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We should arrange
a security guard to find him.

425
00:30:28,106 --> 00:30:30,540  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No one's going
to provideyou with anything...

426
00:30:30,609 --> 00:30:32,543  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
onceyou explain your theory...

427
00:30:32,611 --> 00:30:35,978  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
on how Roland Fuller
is capable ofthese murders.

428
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:38,572  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You've got a brother,
don'tyou, Scully?

429
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,413  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah, two.

430
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:42,419  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Haveyou ever thought about
calling one ofthem...

431
00:30:42,487 --> 00:30:44,421  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and then all ofa sudden,
the phone rings...

432
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:46,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and it's one ofthem calling you?

433
00:30:46,491 --> 00:30:48,425  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Does this pitch end...

434
00:30:48,493 --> 00:30:50,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
with a way for me to lower
my long distance charges?

435
00:30:50,428 --> 00:30:52,225  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Evidence suggests psychic connections...

436
00:30:52,297 --> 00:30:54,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
are stronger between
family members.

437
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:57,462  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Particularly between twins
that shared the same womb.

438
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,164  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Okay, but in this case...

439
00:31:00,238 --> 00:31:02,604  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
one sibling has closer ties
to a frozen Fudgsicle...

440
00:31:02,674 --> 00:31:04,608  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
than to his own brother.

441
00:31:04,676 --> 00:31:06,610  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Arthur Grable is not dead.

442
00:31:06,678 --> 00:31:08,612  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's in a state ofconsciousness...

443
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,978  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
that no human
has ever returned from.

444
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:13,779  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What ifthat state allows one
to develop psychic ability...

445
00:31:13,852 --> 00:31:17,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
beyond the potential
ofthe conscious mind?

446
00:31:17,189 --> 00:31:20,283  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He could use that ability
to control his brother...

447
00:31:20,392 --> 00:31:23,225  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to kill those scientists.

448
00:31:23,295 --> 00:31:25,422  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But whywould he kill
his colleagues?

449
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's a question
only Dr. Nollette can answer.

450
00:31:29,234 --> 00:31:31,168  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Okay, let's go.

451
00:31:31,236 --> 00:31:33,170  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I have to call my brother.

452
00:31:37,042 --> 00:31:39,602  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mulder:
We'vegot to fiindNollette.

453
00:31:39,678 --> 00:31:41,612  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Scully:
Let's talk to campussecurity.

454
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,614  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wego this way?

455
00:31:43,682 --> 00:31:46,082  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, wegoleft.

456
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:10,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, whereveryou are, Arthur...

457
00:32:10,942 --> 00:32:15,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm sureyou'll appreciate this.

458
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:14,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Arthur and Roland Grable.

459
00:34:14,499 --> 00:34:17,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Born at Puget Presbyterian
to Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Grable...

460
00:34:17,502 --> 00:34:19,936  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
onJuly 1 5, 1 952.

461
00:34:20,004 --> 00:34:23,667  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Arthurwas four minutes
older than Roland.

462
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:25,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Identical twins.

463
00:34:25,744 --> 00:34:28,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Which means
they're the result ofa single egg...

464
00:34:28,747 --> 00:34:32,183  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
fertilized by a single sperm.

465
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,184  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I've read studies...

466
00:34:34,252 --> 00:34:36,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
which suggest that, in some cases...

467
00:34:36,254 --> 00:34:38,279  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
the identical twin arises
very early in the embryonic stage...

468
00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:40,824  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
when a mutation in one cell
is rejected by the other cells...

469
00:34:40,892 --> 00:34:42,826  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
as foreign.

470
00:34:42,894 --> 00:34:44,828  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So Roland's condition
is the result of...

471
00:34:44,896 --> 00:34:47,626  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
a damaged chromosome rejected
by one ofArthur's cells?

472
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,963  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
In a way,
that would explain Arthur's genius...

473
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:51,968  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and Roland's strange mathematical gift.

474
00:34:52,036 --> 00:34:53,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
In a way.

475
00:34:53,872 --> 00:34:55,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(phone rings)

476
00:34:55,707 --> 00:34:57,641  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Agent Scully.

477
00:34:57,709 --> 00:35:00,303  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is Larry Barrington
at the Avalon Foundation.

478
00:35:00,378 --> 00:35:02,346  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We've got a situation here.

479
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:03,608  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Uh-huh.

480
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:06,775  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Last night,
we had a break-in at the facility.

481
00:35:06,851 --> 00:35:08,785  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's right.

482
00:35:08,853 --> 00:35:11,083  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's Arthur Grable's storage unit.

483
00:35:11,156 --> 00:35:13,215  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
His internalthermostat's
been compromised.

484
00:35:13,324 --> 00:35:15,383  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, is there any tissue damage?

485
00:35:15,493 --> 00:35:17,427  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're trying to assess that now.

486
00:35:17,495 --> 00:35:19,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The temperature's still rising.

487
00:35:19,497 --> 00:35:22,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Something's blocking our access
to the cooling program.

488
00:35:24,169 --> 00:35:26,660  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Someone tampered with
Arthur Grable's capsule.

489
00:35:26,738 --> 00:35:28,933  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They're attempting
to stabilize it now.

490
00:35:30,508 --> 00:35:32,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nollette.

491
00:36:25,296 --> 00:36:27,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What?

492
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:30,333  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What is it?

493
00:36:49,487 --> 00:36:52,183  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(alarm ringing)

494
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:05,428  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
"Ifl have seen further
than other men...

495
00:37:05,503 --> 00:37:10,941  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
it's because I have stood
on the shoulders ofgiants."

496
00:37:11,009 --> 00:37:15,105  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No.

497
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:18,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This isn'tyours.

498
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,241  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's amazing.

499
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:24,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's this body sitting there...

500
00:37:24,188 --> 00:37:26,122  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
in front ofme talking...

501
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:29,887  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
butyou're controlling it, Arthur.

502
00:37:29,994 --> 00:37:34,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You took mywork.

503
00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:36,466  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(snickers)

504
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:38,468  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What good was yourwork
going to doyou?

505
00:37:38,536 --> 00:37:40,504  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You died before
you could finish it...

506
00:37:40,572 --> 00:37:42,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
beforeyou could publish it.

507
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,867  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It was mine!

508
00:37:44,943 --> 00:37:46,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And a brilliant piece ofwork too.

509
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:49,209  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
When I saw the writing
on the white board...

510
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,214  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I knew someone had found the key.

511
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:53,546  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mach 1 5 was within our reach.

512
00:37:53,618 --> 00:37:55,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Our futures were guaranteed.

513
00:37:55,954 --> 00:37:58,047  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ironic, isn't it?

514
00:37:58,122 --> 00:38:00,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You did all the work...

515
00:38:00,658 --> 00:38:02,455  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and I get all the glory.

516
00:38:02,594 --> 00:38:04,528  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No!

517
00:38:04,596 --> 00:38:06,530  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes.

518
00:38:06,598 --> 00:38:09,089  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, Arthur.

519
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,658  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I was here working
on the intake problem...

520
00:38:12,737 --> 00:38:16,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
moments away from a solution
when you attacked me.

521
00:38:16,908 --> 00:38:19,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fortunately, I was carrying a gun.

522
00:38:19,143 --> 00:38:22,704  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
After the murder ofmy colleagues,
who could blame me?

523
00:38:23,748 --> 00:38:25,340  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No.

524
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:28,214  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, that's interesting.

525
00:38:29,287 --> 00:38:31,346  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(laughs:)
I've got it.

526
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:33,890  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's it.

527
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:36,654  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I've got it!

528
00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:25,605  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(groans)

529
00:39:35,386 --> 00:39:37,320  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Arthur!

530
00:39:41,092 --> 00:39:44,027  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Arthur, open the door!

531
00:39:46,164 --> 00:39:47,324  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Arthur!

532
00:40:20,098 --> 00:40:22,532  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Arthur, how doyou stop this?!

533
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tell me how!
Arthur!

534
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:29,135  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wait!
Roland, we need you to help us.

535
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:31,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Please, we need you to help us...

536
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:33,243  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to stop the machine.

537
00:40:34,278 --> 00:40:37,008  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(child crying)

538
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:39,242  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Try to remember how.

539
00:40:41,152 --> 00:40:44,212  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland, you've got to help him
or he'll die.

540
00:40:49,594 --> 00:40:51,721  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wave good-bye, Arthur.

541
00:41:09,413 --> 00:41:10,846  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(screaming)

542
00:41:10,915 --> 00:41:13,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mulder:
Come on, Roland.

543
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:15,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland:
I can't remember...

544
00:41:15,753 --> 00:41:17,015  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(yells)

545
00:41:55,993 --> 00:41:57,927  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Scully:
He'll be held in...

546
00:41:57,995 --> 00:42:00,225  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
psychiatric custody for evaluation.

547
00:42:00,298 --> 00:42:02,163  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is he being charged
with a crime?

548
00:42:02,233 --> 00:42:05,498  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The D.A. hasn't made
that determination yet.

549
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:09,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But we've recommended that
he be remanded toyour custody...

550
00:42:09,273 --> 00:42:11,537  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
as soon as the court
deems it appropriate.

551
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:13,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How could this happen?

552
00:42:13,945 --> 00:42:17,210  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland never exhibited
anyviolent tendencies.

553
00:42:17,281 --> 00:42:22,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's my beliefthat he wasn't
acting under his own volition.

554
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,347  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What doyou mean?

555
00:42:24,422 --> 00:42:27,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is the work ofArthur Grable,
Roland's brother.

556
00:42:27,258 --> 00:42:29,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's a new theory ofjet propulsion...

557
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,524  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
unfinished at the time
ofhis death.

558
00:42:31,596 --> 00:42:33,530  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
In the last two weeks Roland has...

559
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:35,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
completed the calculations.

560
00:42:35,466 --> 00:42:36,524  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How?

561
00:42:36,601 --> 00:42:38,626  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're not sure, Mrs. Stodie.

562
00:42:38,703 --> 00:42:40,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All we know is that Roland...

563
00:42:40,705 --> 00:42:43,299  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
was somehow able to finish
his brother's research.

564
00:43:01,826 --> 00:43:03,760  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland?

565
00:43:07,531 --> 00:43:09,465  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where areyou going?

566
00:43:13,037 --> 00:43:15,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roland, don't go.

567
00:43:15,273 --> 00:43:18,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I have to.

568
00:43:18,509 --> 00:43:21,103  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Okay. Bye.

569
00:43:22,813 --> 00:43:26,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tracy...

570
00:43:26,784 --> 00:43:28,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
wait.

571
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:44,267  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Keep my stars.

572
00:43:57,081 --> 00:44:01,347  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I loveyou.

573
00:44:01,419 --> 00:44:04,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Me too.
