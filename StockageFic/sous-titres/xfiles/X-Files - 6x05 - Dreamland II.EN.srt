Remember our first apartment?

496
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:28,666
That dump in Pentagon City?

497
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:32,659
You'd turn the air conditioner on
and the lights would go out.

498
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:37,063
Or when you were pregnant, how I'd
tickle your kneecaps to make you laugh?

499
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,610
Remember? Remember the night
Chrissy was born?

500
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:43,114
Remember? Remember the night
Chrissy was born?

501
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:46,550
And I held her in my arms
all red-faced and screaming?

502
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,543
That's the only time
I ever saw you cry.

503
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,158
Oh, my God.

504
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,527
Morris?

505
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,863
Is that you?

506
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,898
<i>[ Mulder ]</i>
<i>Come on, Morris. Let's go.</i>

507
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,834
<i>What do you mean, "go''?</i>
<i>Where are you taking him?</i>

508
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:06,604
We have reason to believe
that whatever event...

509
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,907
caused this to happen
may be in the process of reversing.

510
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,643
<i>[ Mulder ] We got to get back to</i>
<i>the exact spot where this all began.</i>

511
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:15,479
<i>It may be our only chance.</i>

512
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:19,472
<i>[ Vehicle Approaching ]</i>

513
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,728
Sorry, Morris.
A traitor's a traitor.

514
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:34,721
- This isn't what it looks like.
- Got it.

515
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:53,206
Sir.

516
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:10,501
- What are you doing?
- I'm cleaning up a mess.

517
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,536
- What are you talking about?
- About an hour ago,

518
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,972
I put Captain McDonough and Mrs. Chee
back where they belong.

519
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,641
- Now it's their turn.
- The warp that started this...

520
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,577
is snapping back
like a rubber band.

521
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:23,570
Only we have to be
in its path when it happens.

522
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,152
Why are you doing this?

523
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,589
Till now, I had a spotless
career record. I want that back.

524
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:34,825
So this is time snapping back?

525
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:38,195
It'll be like
the last few days never happened.
You won't remember any of this.

526
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:42,188
Oh, well, in that case,
Dana, it's been real.

527
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,945
Come on, Mulder.

528
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:58,938
Let's go.

<i>[ Cell Phone Ringing ]</i>

532
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,618
- Mulder.
- [ Scully ] Mulder, it's me.

533
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:38,556
I just wanted to let you know
that we slipped under Kersh's radar.

534
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,358
Our little field trip
to Nevada went unnoticed.

535
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:44,261
- Oh, yeah?
- Mulder,

536
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:47,765
I'm sorry that your confidential
source didn't pan out.

537
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:51,758
I guess you were right, Scully.
Just another crackpot
who watches too much <i>Star Trek.</i>

538
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:56,206
- Good night.
- Hey, Scully.

539
00:42:56,206 --> 00:43:00,199
I, uh, know it's not your normal life,
but thanks for coming out there with me.

540
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:05,238
You're welcome.
