THAT DURING THIS TIME,

SHE WAS SUBJECTED TO
A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS...

68
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:34,626

THEY EXTRACTED HER OVA ?

CONCEIVED AS A RESULT
OF THOSE EXPERIMENTS.

AND THAT
CAN BE DONE AS WELL ?

74
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:49,507
I DON'T KNOW
HOW ELSE TO EXPLAIN IT.

75
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:52,794

HASN'T GIVEN BIRTH.

MEDICINAL
OR, UH, RECREATIONAL ?

343
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,372
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

344
00:29:55,372 --> 00:29:58,291
PREGNANT WOMEN HAVE
THOSE HORMONES IN ABUNDANCE.

345
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:01,561
YOU WOULDN'T GIVE THOSE

00:30:13,473 --> 00:30:16,860
ACTUALLY, I'M LOOKING FOR HIM.
HE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

351
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,796
I WAS GOING TO START
MY BEAUTY SLEEP.

352
00:30:21,264 --> 00:30:23,266
YOUR BEAUTY SLEEP.
WHAT IS THAT ?

353
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:27,237
HE SAID IT'S TAKEN YEARS
OFF MY APPEARANCE.

354

IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.
SETTLE DOWN.

362
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:55,425
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
OUT OF THERE AS FAST
AS WE CAN, OKAY ?

363
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:48,130
FLINCH AND YOU'RE DEAD.

364
00:34:50,633 --> 00:34:53,135
HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE 'EM.

365
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:57,139
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE ?

00:35:15,107 --> 00:35:17,860
TAKE THAT GUN OFF ME
AND PUT IT ON THAT MAN.

371
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,281
STOP RIGHT THERE.

372
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:26,986
RUN.  GET OUT OF HERE.

373
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:34,009
DON'T USE YOUR GUN.
GET OUT OF HERE !

374
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:36,762
I SAID STOP RIGHT THERE.

375
00:35:48,974 --> 00:35:51,944
- KRESGE !
- I SAID STOP RIGHT THERE.

376
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:53,245
DON'T FIRE, KRESGE !

377
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,716
I'M AN F.B.I. AGENT.
I HAVE AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.

378
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:15,718
I NEED AN AMBULANCE
AND BACKUP.

379
00:36:24,043 --> 00:36:26,045
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.
MULDER.

380
00:36:26,545 --> 00:36:28,547
I GOT HIM INSIDE.
YOU HAVE YOUR WEAPON ?

381
00:36:28,547 --> 00:36:30,549
HE'S IN THERE ON THE FLOOR.
I GOT HIS HANDS CUFFED.

382
00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:32,551
I GOT BACKUP COMING.
THEY NEED A LOCATION THOUGH.

383
00:36:32,551 --> 00:36:35,538
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
JUST WATCH THE GUY.

384
00:36:36,872 --> 00:36:40,276
DETECTIVE KRESGE IS GOING TO
RADIO IN THE LOCATION.

385
00:37:06,235 --> 00:37:08,237
SHE'S GONE
INTO A COMA.

386
00:37:12,741 --> 00:37:15,044
I'M OKAY, MULDER.

387
00:37:16,445 --> 00:37:18,664
IT'S WHAT'S MEANT TO BE.

388
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:24,403
BUT IF YOU
COULD TREAT HER--
I WOULDN'T.

389
00:37:24,403 --> 00:37:26,655
I WOULDN'T DO IT TO HER.

390
00:37:29,925 --> 00:37:31,844
ARE YOU SURE ?

391
00:37:31,844 --> 00:37:35,798
MULDER, WHOEVER
BROUGHT THIS CHILD
INTO THIS WORLD...

392
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,301
DIDN'T INTEND
TO LOVE HER.

393
00:37:40,753 --> 00:37:43,255
I THINK SHE WAS--

394
00:37:43,255 --> 00:37:45,758
SHE WAS BORN
TO SERVE AN AGENDA.

395
00:37:49,128 --> 00:37:51,130
I HAVE A CHANCE
TO STOP THAT.

396
00:37:56,635 --> 00:37:58,137
YOU WERE RIGHT.

397
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:05,144
THIS CHILD
WAS NOT MEANT TO BE.

398
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,319
I'LL STAY WITH YOU.

399
00:38:15,321 --> 00:38:17,823
I THINK I'D LIKE
TO BE ALONE.

400
00:40:08,584 --> 00:40:10,819
ARE YOU READY ?

401
00:40:12,271 --> 00:40:14,606
I THINK I'LL GET
A RIDE BACK WITH MULDER.

402
00:40:43,268 --> 00:40:44,770
BYE-BYE, MATTHEW.

403
00:40:51,276 --> 00:40:53,278
WE'LL SEE YOU
AT HOME, OKAY ?

404
00:41:52,337 --> 00:41:57,526
WHO ARE THE MEN
WHO WOULD CREATE A LIFE
WHOSE ONLY HOPE IS TO DIE ?

405
00:41:57,526 --> 00:42:00,495
I DON'T KNOW.

406
00:42:02,998 --> 00:42:05,500
BUT THAT YOU
FOUND HER...

407
00:42:07,002 --> 00:42:10,005
AND YOU HAD A CHANCE
TO LOVE HER--

408
00:42:10,005 --> 00:42:12,841
MAYBE SHE WAS MEANT
FOR THAT TOO.

409
00:42:14,293 --> 00:42:16,295
SHE FOUND ME.

410
00:42:16,295 --> 00:42:19,081
SO YOU COULD SAVE HER.

411
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:29,491
HOW'S DETECTIVE KRESGE ?
HE'S DOING BETTER.
 HE'S OUT OF THE I.C.U.

412
00:42:29,491 --> 00:42:32,060
AND THE MEN
WHO DID THIS TO HIM ?

413
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:35,430
THEY ALREADY CLEANED UP
THE NURSING HOME.

414
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:38,433
ALL THE WOMEN ARE BEING
PLACED IN NEW HOMES.

415
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:41,436
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
THAT ANYONE ELSE AT
THE PRANGEN CORPORATION...

416
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:43,689
KNEW OF CALDERON'S WORK.

417
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,230
THERE IS EVIDENCE
OF WHAT THEY DID.

418
00:44:51,582 --> 00:44:54,152
[ Child ]
I MADE THIS.
