talking to me?

543
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:37,006
All those people out there?

544
00:36:44,749 --> 00:36:47,877
Last night

545
00:36:47,952 --> 00:36:51,183
I dreamt Tipet
was inside my house

546
00:36:51,222 --> 00:36:53,713
holding an ax.

547
00:36:53,758 --> 00:36:55,851
I thought

548
00:36:55,894 --> 00:36:58,863
I woke up this morning.

549
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:02,195
I thought I was awake,
but-but then--

550
00:37:02,267 --> 00:37:06,829
Uh... what do you want me to do,
pinch you?

551
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,671
You're already awake.

552
00:37:10,742 --> 00:37:14,678
Stedman and Leeds must have
experienced the same thing...

553
00:37:14,746 --> 00:37:17,010
all Tipet's victims.

554
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:20,016
Everything seemed real

555
00:37:20,084 --> 00:37:22,575
but it was a dream...

556
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:27,815
...a dream that ended
in their deaths.

557
00:37:27,892 --> 00:37:31,623
Anthony Tipet is in a coma,
never to regain consciousness.

558
00:37:34,732 --> 00:37:37,963
He knows me now.

559
00:37:38,002 --> 00:37:41,267
He can enter in my dreams.

560
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:45,241
Listen to me.

561
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,244
You've had a tough couple days.

562
00:37:47,312 --> 00:37:48,802
You're tired.

563
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:54,216
Go home, get some rest.

564
00:39:06,658 --> 00:39:10,424
[ Backward-masked Record Playing
In Reverse ] She's going to die.

565
00:39:10,662 --> 00:39:15,292
I'm not going
to let you do that.

566
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:18,301
I'm sorry.

567
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:21,270
I'm not going to kill her.

568
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:25,709
You are.

569
00:41:37,975 --> 00:41:40,170
[ Scully ]
Agent Doggett?

570
00:41:40,378 --> 00:41:42,175
Agent Doggett.

571
00:41:45,149 --> 00:41:47,208
[Whispering ]
Hi.

572
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:53,386
How'd you get here?

573
00:41:53,424 --> 00:41:56,325
Your door was unlocked.

574
00:41:56,394 --> 00:42:00,228
You just saved my life,
Agent Scully.

575
00:42:00,298 --> 00:42:04,530
I just woke you up,
Agent Doggett.

576
00:42:07,605 --> 00:42:11,166
Tipet's in my dreams.

577
00:42:13,477 --> 00:42:15,877
If you hadn't woken me up
just now--

578
00:42:15,947 --> 00:42:17,847
Anthony Tipet is dead.

579
00:42:19,584 --> 00:42:22,280
I got the call from Skinner
on my way over here.

580
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:26,119
He never regained
consciousness.

581
00:42:31,562 --> 00:42:33,962
Are you okay?

582
00:42:33,998 --> 00:42:36,228
I seem to be, yes.

583
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,892
Well, if you need
some more time off--

584
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:43,066
No. I'm, um...
I'm back at work now.

585
00:42:46,577 --> 00:42:48,943
That must have been
some nightmare you just had.

586
00:42:50,882 --> 00:42:53,248
Tipet thought he'd fiind God

587
00:42:53,317 --> 00:42:57,219
by looking in the darkness
inside himself.

588
00:42:57,255 --> 00:43:00,588
You don't think he succeeded?

589
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,996
In my dreams, I--

590
00:43:07,064 --> 00:43:10,261
I saw terrible...

591
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:13,997
violent images.

592
00:43:14,071 --> 00:43:17,370
Scared the living daylights
out of me.

593
00:43:20,311 --> 00:43:21,869
These things

594
00:43:21,946 --> 00:43:23,004
are a part of me.

595
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:28,279
I can't deny that,
but... maybe--

596
00:43:28,352 --> 00:43:32,288
maybe they didn't come from me.

597
00:43:32,323 --> 00:43:35,656
Then where'd they come from?

598
00:43:37,895 --> 00:43:40,227
It was a bad dream,
Agent Doggett

599
00:43:40,298 --> 00:43:42,266
but that's all it was.

600
00:44:29,613 --> 00:44:31,615
[ Child ]
I made this.

601
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,607
[ Child ]
I made this.
