1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,472
Blood everywhere.
Whoever killed her is a psycho.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,711
- Murder weapon?
- Seven stores in town carry strop razors.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,633
- Have somebody check 'em out.
- What about the press?

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,678
Just the basics.
No mention of this "sister" thing.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,398
OK.

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,756
Rubin, I need your final report.
Call me as soon as you hear.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,389
- That's all I can tell you.
- Can you give us a name?

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,311
Yeah, I'll talk to you.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,550
<i>(press continue to shout questions)</i>

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,871
We're doing the best we can.
We'll inform you...

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,991
<i>(knock at door)</i>

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,271
Brian, I need a minute.

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,874
I'm working on a homicide investigation.

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,632
Come on.

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,517
You didn't show last night.

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,557
This what you wanna talk about?

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,200
- I made dinner.
- <i>(Brian sighs)</i>

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,878
- <i>(intercom)</i>
- What?

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,315
<i>Sorry. Coroner's on one.</i>

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,197
Yeah, what have you got, Rubin?

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,837
Uh-huh.

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,429
Uh... Hang on a second, will you, Rubin?

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,956
- This address, ten o'clock tonight.
- Where's this?

24
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,872
- A motel?
- It's a place we can talk.

25
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,037
<i>(voices whispering)</i>

26
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,191
<i>(car engine starts)</i>

27
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,078
<i>(man grunts)</i>

28
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,836
<i>(woman gasps)</i>

29
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,551
<i>(Scully)</i> Any cavities?

30
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,474
I brush after every meal.

31
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,551
Would you say they match?

32
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,278
Well, there's a filling on the occlusal surface
of the upper left bicuspid, here and here.

33
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,232
And he's congenitally missing
a lower left bicuspid, here and here.

34
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,629
Yeah, I'd say they're definitely a match.

35
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,917
- Who do they belong to?
- Special Agent Sam Chaney.

36
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,432
- That name sounds familiar.
- Chaney's a legend.

37
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,876
40 years before the Bureau
profiled violent criminals...

38
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,555
...Chaney and his partner,
Tim Ledbetter, investigated...

39
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,474
...what were then called "stranger killings",
now called "serial murders".

40
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,473
They disappeared while investigating
murders in Aubrey, Missouri, in 1942.

41
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,429
Chaney's body was only found two days ago
by a local detective, BJ Morrow, a woman.

42
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,158
Why the interest in this case?

43
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,870
At the time, Chaney's and Ledbetter's ideas
weren't very well received by their peers.

44
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,635
Using psychology to solve a crime
was something like, um...

45
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,154
- Believing in the paranormal?
- Exactly.

46
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,151
But there's another mystery.

47
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,955
Which is?

48
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,068
Why would this policewoman suddenly drive
her car into a field the size of Rhode Island...

49
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,711
...and, for no reason, dig up the bones
of a man who's been missing for 50 years?

50
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,316
- Unless a neon sign said "Dig here"!
- I guess that's why we're going to Aubrey.

51
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,791
Yes. And also, I've always
been intrigued by women named BJ.

52
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,715
Detective Morrow,
exactly how did you discover the remains?

53
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,791
I saw a dog digging in the ground.

54
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,792
I proceeded to investigate
and found the grave site.

55
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,590
The initial police report states that
you couldn't explain your actions at the time.

56
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,797
It was late.
I was a bit shocked by my discovery.

57
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,271
I'm afraid I didn't clearly articulate
what happened for my initial report.

58
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,594
Why were you in the woods at that hour?

59
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,797
My vehicle was experiencing engine failure.

60
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,796
You left your car...

61
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,632
Over there, sir.

62
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,790
Would you say that's, uh... 400 or 500 yards?

63
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,109
Yes, sir.

64
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,512
So from that distance you could see
a dog digging in this field at night?

65
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,991
She took a short cut through the woods to
reach a phone. The path led her to the field.

66
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,915
The report says she phoned from the Motel
Black up the road. That's not a very short cut.

67
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,879
<i>(chuckles)</i> You seem more interested
in how the missing agent was found...

68
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,474
...than in how he got here in the first place.

69
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,917
- You don't, uh... suspect her, do you?
- No, no. Not at all.

70
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,993
- I'd just like to ask you a few more questions.
- All right.

71
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,831
Have you ever, um...

72
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,798
Have you ever had
any clairvoyant experiences?

73
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,839
Premonitions, visions,
precognitive dreams, things like that?

74
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,309
What the hell kind of question is that?

75
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,157
- Dreams?
- Yeah.

76
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,312
Agent Mulder, I don't mean to be rude,
but we have a lot to do.

77
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,430
If you have any more questions specific
to your investigation of this crime...

78
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,590
...please feel free to call. Come on, BJ.

79
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,756
<i>(Scully)</i> What do <i>you</i> think?

80
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,277
These bones are in good condition.

81
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,557
The field may have been tilled
soon after Chaney was buried.

82
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,668
There are small cuts on the top three ribs.
I don't think they were made by an animal.

83
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,959
Listen to this. "One must wonder how these
monsters are created." Chaney wrote this.

84
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,192
"Did their home life mould them
into creatures that must maim and kill?"

85
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,350
"Or are they demons from birth?"

86
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,159
That's poetic, but it doesn't help us much.

87
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,198
What did he say about the 1942 homicides?

88
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,829
The press called the murderer
"the Slash Killer".

89
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,708
His three victims
were all young women aged 25 to 30.

90
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,917
He disabled them with a blow to the head.

91
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,839
He'd carve the word "sister" on their chests
and paint it on the wall with their blood.

92
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,951
The victims bled to death and...

93
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,031
...the murderer was never found.

94
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,478
Mulder...

95
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,199
...these cuts on the ribs
could've been made by a razor.

96
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,033
- Can you make out a word?
- No.

97
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,477
But we might be able to if we can find
somebody in Aubrey with a digital scanner.

98
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,111
I've scanned the crime photo and ribcage
images and modemed them to Quantico.

99
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,270
It'll be a few seconds before hook-up.

100
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,511
I checked with the mechanic.
BJ's car was just tuned.

101
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,876
She lied about experiencing engine failure.

102
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,475
I don't think BJ was in the woods
because of engine failure.

103
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,516
What are you talking about?

104
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,909
The Motel Black is a perfect meeting place.

105
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,231
- Away from town, away from his wife.
- What do you mean?

106
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,357
It's obvious BJ and Tillman
are having an affair.

107
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,319
How do you know?

108
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,789
- A woman senses these things.
- Oh...

109
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,995
The image on the right is Chaney's ribcage.

110
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,631
The left one was extrapolated from the crime
photo of the Slash Killer's last victim.

111
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,238
Now I need to enlarge the victim's ribcage
in order to allow for gender difference.

112
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,234
And now... we can compare them.

113
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,673
Could he have carved out another word
on his ribcage?

114
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,910
<i>(typing)</i>

115
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,519
I'm searching for
any matching pattern of cuts.

116
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,511
<i>(BJ)</i> Agent Mulder?

117
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,478
Have you made any progress
in the investigation?

118
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,039
Uh, we may have.

119
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,079
Agent Chaney might have been
a victim of the killer he was trying to catch.

120
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,153
We're trying to determine if the cuts
on his ribcage spell out a word.

121
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,151
Are you all right?

122
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,356
I'm sorry. Something...

123
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,272
I'm not feel... Excuse me.

124
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,358
Feeling better?

125
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,430
I'm fine now.

126
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,795
Things must be difficult for you now.

127
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:16,228
I've had feelings for people I've worked with.
Interoffice relationships can be complicated.

128
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,554
Especially when he's married.

129
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,431
You're pregnant, aren't you?

130
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,191
Does it show?

131
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,398
No, not yet.

132
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,598
Now I know why my mother
only had one child.

133
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,389
She told me about the nausea,
but not about the nightmares.

134
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,152
Nightmares?

135
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,191
It's always the same.

136
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,316
I'm in a house.

137
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,793
It feels familiar. There's a woman
that's been hurt. There's a mirror.

138
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,916
I see a man's reflection.

139
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,391
I recognise his face, but I don't know him.

140
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,631
What I remember most is the blood.
There's a lot of blood.

141
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,556
Have you talked to anyone about this?

142
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,634
I'm sure it's something about the pregnancy.
If anyone else knew I was pregnant...

143
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,995
Brian would kill me if I told anyone.

144
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,911
What are you going to do?

145
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,036
I don't know.

146
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,269
Well, BJ's pregnant. And Tillman's the father.

147
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,873
<i>(footsteps)</i>

148
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,478
Um, I've approximated the pattern of the cuts
to match up with the letters.

149
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,832
There's a 93% chance that this is the letter R.

150
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,713
And if you lower the probability to 79%...

151
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,680
...you get the letters I, E and R.

152
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,912
It could be a word,
or it could just be random slashes.

153
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,709
<i>(Mulder)</i> If we exhumed a victim
of the Slash Killer, we could do a CT scan...

154
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,872
...to determine if the cuts
were made by the same instrument.

155
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,635
<i>(Scully)</i> That means getting a court order.
That could take two days.

156
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,871
- Maybe we could find a relative who could...
- Brother.

157
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,633
Excuse me?

158
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,631
I know what it says.

159
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,310
On the ribcage, it spells "brother".

160
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,592
You're right.

161
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,632
BJ?

162
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,353
<i>(BJ)</i> Brian.

163
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,317
What's goin' on here, BJ?

164
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,234
- Nothing.
- Really? Then where'd you get these?

165
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,993
These are crime-scene photos.
They were sealed. No one had access to 'em.

166
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,150
You're wrong. Those were shot in 1942.

167
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,277
These are from a homicide
that occurred three days ago.

168
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,239
No, they're from a case that Ledbetter
and Chaney investigated in 1942...

169
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,117
...before they disappeared.

170
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,879
Three days ago,
a young woman was murdered.

171
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,839
The word "sister" was carved
into her chest and painted on the wall.

172
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,469
Only myself, the coroner
and one of my men knew about this.

173
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,350
Excuse me, sir. We just got a call.
There's been another one.

174
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,997
Watch your step, sir.

175
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,635
The victim's name is Verna Johnson.

176
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,832
<i>(BJ)</i> Oh, my God.

177
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,877
- BJ?
- <i>(whispers)</i> It's her.

178
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,475
It's the woman in my dream.

179
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,715
- Ow!
- <i>(BJ</i> gasps)

180
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,030
Oh, you'll be all right.

181
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,278
Honey, you're fine.

182
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,271
The mothering instinct.

183
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,915
I've been feeling it a lot lately.

184
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,071
I used to hate it
when my mother hovered over me.

185
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,310
I swore I'd never be like her.

186
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,991
I think we all feel that way
at one time or another.

187
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,072
My father was a cop.

188
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,151
A good cop.

189
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,595
That's all I ever wanted to be.

190
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,319
He'd say what we're doing here is nonsense.
That you can't solve a crime from a dream.

191
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,713
I've often felt that dreams are answers to
questions we haven't figured out how to ask.

192
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,829
You said you were in a familiar house?

193
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,356
There's a woman that's been hurt.

194
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,831
I look in a mirror and I see a man's reflection.

195
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,672
What does he look like?

196
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,070
He's... got a rash on his face.

197
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,591
And his eyes are...

198
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,311
...intense.

199
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,751
Do you remember anything else?

200
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,351
There's this strange picture
on the wall behind him.

201
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,116
It's a building like the...
Washington Monument, but different.

202
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,633
And there's a...

203
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,793
...a big circular thing beside it.

204
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,474
- Do you think you could draw it?
- Sure.

205
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,589
It looked something like this.

206
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,711
What do you think it is?

207
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,754
Could be the Trylon and the Perisphere.
Ever been to New York City?

208
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,909
No, never.

209
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,834
You can get pictures of these
on postcards all over Times Square.

210
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,718
These were symbols of the 1939 World's Fair.

211
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,598
Do you know why
they might have been in your dream?

212
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,875
No idea at all.

213
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,278
Good night.

214
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,471
You're here kind of late.

215
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,112
- What are you looking for?
- I just wanted to check on somethin'.

216
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,479
I don't get it. That book's from the 1940s.

217
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,635
Can we talk?

218
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,799
You know, I'm willing to go with you...

219
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,150
...for the appointment.

220
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,390
I'm not so sure it's what I wanna do.

221
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,916
I thought we agreed
that it was the best thing for both of us.

222
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,510
- I changed my mind.
- What do you mean, you changed...

223
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,355
You can'tjust change your mind.
This isn't your decision. It's <i>our</i> decision.

224
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,031
BJ?

225
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,791
<i>(BJ)</i> It's him.

226
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,356
Brian...

227
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,311
I have to go.

228
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,670
<i>(Scully)</i> This is the man
BJ claims to have seen in her dream.

229
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,832
Harry Cokely.
He lives in Gainesville, Nebraska...

230
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,754
...since his release from McCallister
Penitentiary on December 5, 1993.

231
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,554
He was convicted in 1945
for rape and attempted murder.

232
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,474
Cokely carved "sister" on the chest
of his victim, Linda Thibedeaux...

233
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,994
...before she could escape and get help.

234
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,277
And the police never connected it
to the 1942 homicides?

235
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,989
No.

236
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,279
I don't wannajump to any rash conclusions,
but I'd say he's definitely our prime suspect.

237
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,591
Mulder, the man we're talking about
is 77 years old.

238
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,275
George Foreman
won the heavyweight crown at 45.

239
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,669
Some people are late bloomers.

240
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,908
Anyway, this still doesn't explain
BJ's connection to all this.

241
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,309
What if it's cryptomnesia?

242
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,194
- Consciously forgotten information?
- Yeah.

243
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,555
BJ's father was a policeman in the area.

244
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,668
Maybe she heard him discuss the 1942 case
when she was young or saw Cokely's picture.

245
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,912
That doesn't explain why she unearthed
the grave of an FBI agent.

246
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,039
What if the recent murders triggered
what had been buried in her mind?

247
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,829
Some connection she'd unconsciously made
that no one else had.

248
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,797
- A hunch?
- Something like that.

249
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,998
- That's a pretty extreme hunch.
- You've had some pretty extreme hunches.

250
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,672
I never have.

251
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,551
<i>(knock at door)</i>

252
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,991
Harry Cokely?

253
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,871
- Yeah.
- I'm Special Agent Mulder.

254
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,317
This is Special Agent Scully. We're with
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

255
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,311
May we come in?

256
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,314
<i>(TV on in background)</i>

257
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,354
Mr Cokely, our records show that in 1942
you lived in Terrance, Nebraska...

258
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,398
...an hour's drive away from Aubrey, Missouri.

259
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,472
During that time, three women
were murdered in Aubrey.

260
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,393
Their assailant mutilated their bodies
with a razor...

261
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,395
...in the same manner that you slashed
Mrs Linda Thibedeaux's body in 1945.

262
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,709
I don't remember much about that.

263
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,112
Well, I'm sure Mrs Thibedeaux
will never forget it.

264
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,039
The doctors said I was sick back then.

265
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,591
They gave me some pills.

266
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,717
I served my time and... now I'm better.

267
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,559
What kind of pills?

268
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,711
Red and white ones, little sister.

269
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,634
Do you recognise this man?

270
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,711
His name's Chaney.

271
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,274
No.

272
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,195
He was an FBI agent
who was also murdered in Aubrey in 1942.

273
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,989
Can you tell me where you were
about 8.35pm two nights ago, Mr Cokely?

274
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,074
- Sittin' right where I am now.
- Do you have a witness to testify to that?

275
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,910
Are you blind?

276
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,912
I can't leave the house
without this damn thing.

277
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,471
I sit right here in front of that TV
24 hours a day.

278
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:38,839
On the night you're talkin' about, I was
sittin' here watchin' a show about a lost dog.

279
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,674
- And after that, a show about...
- That won't be necessary.

280
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,718
Good.

281
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,676
Now, are you about finished with me,
little sister?

282
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,716
For now.

283
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,075
<i>(Cokely coughs)</i>

284
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,831
<i>(voices whispering)</i>

285
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,793
Aargh!

286
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,631
<i>(shutters bang)</i>

293
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,111
<i>(woman)</i> I saw it was a woman.
She seemed to be in trouble but...

294
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,478
...when I opened the door, she barged in
and came running down the stairs.

295
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,471
So I called the police.

296
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,551
<i>(BJ moans)</i> He's here!

297
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,312

<i>(Tillman)</i> BJ... What happened?

299
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,391
- Oh, my God.
- He's here!

300
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,836
Oh, my God. I'm taking her to the hospital.

301
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,199
Thank you.

302
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,430
I thought you might need these.

303
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,798
Thanks.

304
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,391
You hurt yourself.

305
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,916
Can you tell us what happened, BJ?

306
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,040
Cokely. He was in the room.

307
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,350
- Cokely attacked you?
- Yes.

308
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,715
He must have done this while I was asleep.

309
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,110
- You're sure it was him?
- I know it was him.

310
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,909
I saw his reflection in the mirror.
He looked just like his picture.

311
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,354
- Like his mug shot?
- Yes.

312
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,358
- That's the picture of a young man.
- But it was Cokely. I swear it was him.

313
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,868
Well, I'll have Tillman pick him up.

314
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,111
Where were you last night?

315
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,317
Honolulu.

316
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,471
- You were in Aubrey, weren't you?
- <i>(coughs)</i>

317
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,359
How'd you get
into Detective Morrow's house?

318
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,672
It's all I can do to get to the bathroom,
you damn fool!

319
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,595
- The victim has identified you, Mr Cokely.
- I've already paid for my crime.

320
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,114
Well, I'm gonna see that you pay more.

321
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,670
I never touched that woman!

322
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,869
And I'm not answerin' any more questions
without a lawyer.

323
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,831
Get me a lawyer.

324
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,032
- <i>(knock at door)</i>
- <i>(Scully)</i> Mulder?

325
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,792
It's open.

326
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,159
I have the results from the genetic testing of
the blood found under Verna Johnson's nails.

327
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,231
They checked it against Cokely's.

328
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,198
The PGM subtype matches.
The DQ Alpha and D1S80, too.

329
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,955
- It's Cokely's blood?
- The results strongly suggest that.

330
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,238
Imagine the strength of his psychosis,
driving him to murder after 50 years.

331
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,438
- But for some reason he let BJ live.
- Well, she's not the first.

332
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,433
Mrs Thibedeaux also survived his attack
back in 1945.

333
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,671
I think it's time we paid a visit
to Mrs Thibedeaux.

334
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,352
That was taken three weeks
before it happened.

335
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,828
I haven't had a picture taken since.

336
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,390
Is this your husband?

337
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,517
That's Martin. He was a good man.

338
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,997
He passed last June.

339
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,231
If it hadn't been for him,
I never would have survived.

340
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,197
I know this goes back a long way...

341
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,989
...but could you tell us what happened
the night Cokely attacked you?

342
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,911
It happened...

343
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,672
...up there on the landing.

344
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,119
I remember how the light from the window...

345
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,751
...bounced off the razor.

346
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,789
It had an ivory handle.

347
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,231
He kept sayin'...

348
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,150
..."Someone's gotta take the blame,
little sister, and it isn't gonna be me."

349
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,352
They tried to explain at the trial
how his father used to beat him...

350
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,833
...and how he was the only son
in a family of five daughters.

351
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,595
And how he was brutally punished
for everything wrong that happened.

352
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,597
But if you ask me...

353
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,475
...that man was born evil.

354
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,556
No children?

355
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,915
No. None.

356
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:47,034
Our records show that you recuperated
from your injuries within two months.

357
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,317
But nine months later,
you checked back into the hospital.

358
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,990
Well, I had complications.

359
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,031
What happened to the child?

360
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,913
Cokely's child.

361
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,953
Martin used to say... not to blame the child.

362
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:14,113
That it was just a little thing, an innocent.

363
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,718
But it was the spawn of evil.

364
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,469
I couldn't keep it in this house...

365
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,437
...the memory of him.

366
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,071
Mrs Thibedeaux?

367
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,239
I gave the baby to an adoption agency.

368
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,117
Baby... He'd be almost 50 now.

369
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,312
This is the address of the adoption agency.

370
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,231
If you do find him...

371
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,911
No. No, never mind.

372
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,760
<i>(Scully)</i> The bones BJ found under the house
belonged to Chaney's partner, Ledbetter.

373
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,876
Cokely rented the house in 1942.

374
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,715
Detectives at the scene found an old razor
under the house. They're trying to lift prints.

375
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,349
Cokely's been released,
but I think we have enough to nail him.

376
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,591
Something just doesn't track.

377
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,672
The night she was attacked,
BJ said she saw a younger man.

378
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,719
You know her state of mind that night.
She could have been mistaken.

379
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,839
Well, maybe she did see a younger man.
Young Cokely. Cokely's grandson.

380
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,431
Cokely's grandson attacked BJ?

381
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,035
It would make sense.
Genetic traits often skip a generation.

382
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,829
That would explain the blood
under Verna Johnson's fingernails.

383
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,673
PGM subtypes are similar among relatives.

384
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,911
Did Danny call back
with the adoption records yet?

385
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,154
I doubt Mendel had serial killers in mind
when he developed his theory on genetics.

386
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,477
You know, when I was a kid,
I would have nightmares.

387
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:02,680
I'd wake up in the night thinkin'
I was the only person left in the world.

388
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,830
- Then I would hear this.
- <i>(crunch)</i>

389
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,349
- What?
- My dad would be in the study eating these.

390
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,996
Danny Valadeo? It's Agent Scully.

391
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,310
What does that have to do with Cokely?

392
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,638
On a cellular level, we're the sum total
of all our ancestors' biological matter.

393
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,076
But what if more than biological traits
get passed down?

394
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,358
What if I like sunflower seeds because
I'm genetically predisposed to liking them?

395
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,355
Children aren't born liking sunflower seeds.
Behaviour patterns are taught.

396
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,635
We hear of twins, separated at birth...

397
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,713
...who end up in the same occupation,
each naming their child Waldo.

398
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,755
Waldo?

399
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,958
Jung wrote about the collective unconscious.
It's genetic memory.

400
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,877
Yeah, Danny.

401
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,637
Yeah. Thanks. I'll tell him.

402
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,994
Danny tracked down Mrs Thibedeaux's son.

403
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,594
He was a policeman
named Raymond Morrow.

404
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,356
That's BJ's father.

405
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,035
- BJ is Cokely's granddaughter.
- She's responsible for the murders.

406
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,032
- Mulder...
- Get your coat. Let's go.

407
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,508
- Wait. You think BJ's capable of murder?
- No, but Cokely is. BJ has become him.

408
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,116
- That's outrageous!
- I think Cokely's memories, compulsions...

409
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,749
...have been passed on genetically to BJ,
driving her to kill.

410
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,833
So BJ's nightmares are real? She's killing
women and carving "sister" on them?

411
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,512
Yes.

412
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,879
- Then explain the cuts on her own chest.
- I can't. Maybe she did it herself.

413
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,396
Maybe it's a weird stigmata.
Whatever it is, BJ's not herself.

414
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,790
- Where to?
- To warn Mrs Thibedeaux.

415
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:43,034
If BJ has become Cokely in the way I mean,
she may try to finish what Cokely started.

416
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,558
<i>(BJ howls)</i>

417
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,873
Stop it!

418
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,633
- Somebody's gotta take the blame, sister.
- No! No, no! You're not him! You can't be!

419
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,275
And it's not gonna be <i>me!</i>

420
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,400
I'm not afraid to use this.

421
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,868
You have his eyes.

422
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,792
You're...

423
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,233
...him!

424
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,629
No.

425
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,198
You're my grandchild.

426
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,188
- You know what you're doing?!
- Shut up!

427
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,075
He's done this to both of us.

428
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,914
No!

429
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,834
You don't know what you're doing!

430
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,990
He's the one to blame!

431
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,311
Argh!

432
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,551
<i>(tyres screech)</i>

433
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,349
Mrs Thibedeaux? Mrs Thibedeaux!

434
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,112
Mulder...

435
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,797
Mrs Thibedeaux!

436
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,238
What happened?

437
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,198
She had a razor. She tried to kill me.

438
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,271
But something stopped her.

439
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,715
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.

440
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,913
- Can you stand?
- Yeah, I think so.

441
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,753
- Let me help you up the stairs.
- Thank you.

442
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,355
This is Agent Mulder. I need an ambulance
to 238 North 54th Street.

443
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,795
I also need an APB on BJ Morrow.

444
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,398
Yes, that's Detective Morrow. She should
be considered armed and dangerous.

445
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,198
BJ's going after Tillman.

446
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,239
The first murder occurred after BJ got
pregnant. She wants someone to blame.

447
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,995
- I think that's Tillman.
- I don't think so. I think it'll be Cokely.

448
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,960
- Why?
- She must know Cokely's her grandfather.

449
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,315
If she wants someone to blame, it'll be him.

450
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,188
Cokely's not answering his phone.
I'm goin' over there.

451
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,037
<i>(Linda)</i> She had a reason.

- Let's go outside.

- No. Here, now!
- Have you seen Detective Morrow?

455
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,676
No! But I don't care what you've accused
her of. She could not hurt anybody.
