1
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,500
Land sakes, George,
what are you trying to do?

2
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,500
I was trying to be quiet.

3
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,000
Quiet?

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,300
I smelled you on the stairs.

5
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,500
39 years, I'm still
surprised that...

6
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,600
...embalming fluid of yours
doesn't wake the dead.

7
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,800
Didn't wake old Zeke McPherson
tonight, God rest his soul.

8
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,100
You go outside and take those
clothes of yours off...

9
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,700
...so I can rest mine.

10
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,500
George!

11
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,500
I'm going, Tahoma,
I'm going.

12
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,100
What the hell?
What the hell is that?

13
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,500
George?

14
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,300
<i>So, this is where the bad</i>
<i>kids are banished to.</i>

15
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,400
<i>Put me down here I'd probably cook up</i>
<i>a lot of crazy ideas, too.</i>

16
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,300
Good morning. 

17
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,100
Morning.

18
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,800
I'll catch you guys later.

19
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,700
Some friends...
they're just curious.

20
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,400
I'm not here to be a curiosity,
Agent Doggett.

21
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,100
I'm here to work.

22
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,300
I am, too, Agent Scully.

23
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,800
I've been here all weekend
and early this morning...

24
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,600
...went over every X-File
in the cabinet there.

25
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,100
Just left to get
some coffee.

26
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,100
Well...

27
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,100
Do you have any questions? 

28
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,900
Just a few.

29
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,500
Maybe first you could tell me where
your area is here and...

30
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,700
...where mine's going to be. 

31
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,100
This is my partner's office,
Agent Doggett.

32
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,600
You and I will just be
using it for a while.

33
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,400
- So, where do we get started?
- Homicides: Two... in Idaho.

34
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,100
White male, 62,
undertaker by profession, ...

35
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,600
...he was killed on his front
porch about ten feet away from his wife.

36
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,300
Holy god.

37
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,000
Cause of death was blood loss
from numerous deep wounds...

38
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,300
...from bites.

39
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,300
Any thoughts, any questions?

40
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,200
- "Bites"?
- On his head torso and hands.

41
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,200
Two of his fingers are
missing... eaten off.

42
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,500
By what, an animal?

43
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,100
These were murders.

44
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,700
The, uh, bites on his wife
appear to be human.

45
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,000
I've seen some violent crimes, ...

46
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,300
I mean, some seriously
screwed up stuff, but, uh...

47
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,200
...this is extreme.

48
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,700
Is there demonstration
of motive?

49
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,100
Not according to local P.D.

50
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,600
Is there any pattern, uh...
ritual or anything? 

51
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,200
I have to admit, Agent Scully,
I'm at a loss.

52
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, that's a good place to start.

53
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,700
- You the folks from the FBI?
- Yeah.

54
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,100
Yale Abbott,
Cassia County Sheriff's.

55
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,200
Hi. Agent Scully.
This is Agent Doggett.

56
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,400
We like to think we can handle
our own problems around here...

57
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,900
...but a couple hotshots up in the county
seat seem to think this is beyond us.

58
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,400
Not that we don't appreciate your coming out
all this way to give us a hand.

59
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Well, I hope we can.

60
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,300
I have to admit I'm a little
baffled by what I've seen.

61
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,400
Oh, really?

62
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,200
Understand, Detective,
that we've seen...

63
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,500
...cases like yours
regularly on our unit.

64
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,900
Agent Doggett has only
just been assigned to the X-Files.

65
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,400
I can assure you that there's nothing
baffling about human bite marks.

66
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,100
Well, that's just what I was
getting around to, ma'am.

67
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,700
We're not so sure now that
these bites are human.

68
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,000
The bodies were
discovered by neighbors, ...

69
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,500
...so there was contamination
of the general crime scene.

70
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,000
My boys did a real
damn good job of...

71
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,600
...separating the various shoe
prints and pulling these.

72
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,300
Come on over.

73
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,200
Right there, see that?

74
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,900
What is it?

75
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,600
- It's not human, I know that.
- It's not quite animal, either.

76
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
There's only four toes.

77
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,700
That's not an unheard
of birth defect.

78
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,300
Uh, no more rare than
polydactylism.

79
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,000
What did she just say?

80
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,500
I assume she means
it could be human.

81
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,800
Is that a fair assumption?

82
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,100
I say that assumption
is the problem here.

83
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,200
A strange print is found...

84
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,300
...and immediately the most
important piece of evidence...

85
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,400
...is just thrown out to try
and force an explanation.

86
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,300
Maybe this print can help
explain those bite marks.

87
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,600
- How?
- I'm not quite sure yet.

88
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,500
She's not quite sure yet.

89
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,800
Well, I have to say I've worked
a lot of homicides...

90
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,500
...but if the victims laid out
here for any time at all...

91
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,600
...in a setting like this, ...

92
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,600
...it'd be pretty remarkable
if they didn't attract animals.

93
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,900
I think that postmortem predation
is definitely a consideration here, ...

94
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,900
...but I only see one print...

95
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,900
...and if it were an animal there
would be numerous prints...

96
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,000
...all over here and
in the yard.

97
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,900
You agree, Agent Doggett?

98
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,200
I'm going to go take
a look around.

99
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,000
You know, I got two
old folks in the morgue...

100
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,800
...mauled beyond recognition.

101
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,900
I have no motive to go on,
no intent.

102
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,700
There's not one shred of evidence
that cries out for a human explanation, ...

103
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,700
...yet you stand there telling me
flat out...

104
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,000
...that what we're looking for
is a man.

105
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Thanks for everything, Agent Scully.
We'll take it from here.

106
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,400
I'm sure your explanation
will mollify all those...

107
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,100
...hotshots down at the
county seat, Detective.

108
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,100
And relieve any general anxiety about
what this thing might be...

109
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,400
...but only until it strikes again.

110
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,200
And one more thing:

111
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,300
I never said that what you're
looking for is a man.

112
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Agent Scully.

113
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,500
Is that a second print?

114
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,500
It could be but I'm not sure
if it tells us anything.

115
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
Well, maybe there's no prints
in the yard because...

116
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,000
...whatever made these didn't go
through the yard.

117
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,500
It came through the house.

118
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,400
Well, if anything, I'd say this
print leads up the stairs.

119
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,700
Think I've got another
partial here.

120
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,600
You know, there is a more
obvious explanation.

121
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,800
The more basic answer...

122
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,200
...is what we're dealing with
here is simply a man.

123
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,100
A psychotic killer with a deformed foot.

124
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,200
You're familiar with the
principle of Occam's Razor?

125
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah. You take every
possible explanation...

126
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,300
...and you choose the
simplest one.

127
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,800
Agent Mulder used to refer to it as
"Occam's Principle of Limited Imagination."

128
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,200
Unless you have a simple
explanation as to how a killer...

129
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,800
...with a deformed foot
leaves a print only every 25 feet. 

130
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,500
No.

131
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Or to what he'd even be doing
up here.

132
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,200
I don't know. I'm trying to
figure it out just like you are. 

133
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Agent Doggett.

134
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,700
Dark up here.

135
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,100
What do you see?
Agent Scully?

136
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,100
Right now, not a heck of a lot.

137
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,300
If there was anything up here
it might have gone out that window.

138
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,500
You ever carry one of these?

139
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,300
Never.

140
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,700
"V" for victory.

141
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,100
What?

142
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,800
You said the male victim was
missing two fingers?

143
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,400
Well, how did the fingers
get up here?

144
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,300
Well, from their smell,
I'd say they were regurgitated.

145
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,300
Recently. 

146
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,400
By what?

147
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,500
I saw those on the porch, too.

148
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,600
Looks like, to me...
I don't know.

149
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,200
Like it was... it was... 

150
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,700
Hanging there?

151
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
- You're still here.
- Yeah.

152
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,500
Well, I was waiting for some
lab results and then I...

153
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,400
...wanted to take another
look at the body.

154
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,700
Why? What did you find?

155
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,200
Nothing that will allay anyone's
fears about...

156
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,500
...what killed this
man or his wife.

157
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,200
"What"?
You mean "who" killed them. 

158
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
Well, to be honest,
what I found here...

159
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,500
...leans more towards
an animal explanation.

160
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,100
The, uh, scratches on the body match
the four-toed prints that we found.

161
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,500
And the bites have
fang-like tears.

162
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,200
What I thought were marks left by
human molars are now inconclusive...

163
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,600
...because of enzymes that were found
in the bites which are...

164
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,000
...clearly inhuman-
anticoagulents which...

165
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,300
...are found solely in the
saliva of bats.

166
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,500
Bats.

167
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,900
I can't exactly explain it
but I...

168
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,200
...realize that I owe the
Detective an apology.

169
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,500
Well, I'm not so sure about that.

170
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,700
Montana headline circa 1956.

171
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,200
The story's the same as
what you told me.

172
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,700
"The creature was taken to
the county coroner...

173
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,100
...who confirmed it was
neither man nor animal."

174
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,200
Two days later,
the county coroner was disemboweled...

175
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,800
...by something with sharp
teeth and four-toed claws.

176
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,600
Something that ate several body parts
and regurgitated them elsewhere.

177
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,200
Did they ever find it?

178
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,600
Five men died or disappeared...

179
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,200
...and then the killing stops.
Doesn't say why.

180
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,900
But 44 years later it appears
that it's back and killing again.

181
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,900
You see those marks, right?

182
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,100
And the ones over here
on the rafter?

183
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,600
If you ask me,
those look like claw marks.

184
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,100
I don't care what kind of
a savage he is, ...

185
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,400
...what did this isn't human.

186
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,700
Well, if I may speak for
Agent Scully, ...

187
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,900
...I think we're both prepared
to concede that point, Detective.

188
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,200
Then you know what
this thing is?

189
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,000
I've got a newspaper
article I want to show you.

190
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,900
<i>- Agent Doggett...</i>
- A rather strange account from 1956...

191
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,500
I found something.

192
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,700
A photo album. I think it's
our first break on this case.

193
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,500
What is it? 

194
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,100
The victim's daughter-- Ariel--
her dead body was pulled...

195
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,200
- ...from the river here last week.
- I got that call.

196
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,800
Had to come tell
Mrs. McKesson the bad news.

197
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,000
You trying to say there's
some kind of connection?

198
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,200
Well, you not only told her mother that
her 62-year-old daughter was dead...

199
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,900
...but that her body had been horribly
and inexplicably burned.

200
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,400
A daughter who, by the way,
she hadn't even seen in over 40 years.

201
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Since 1956, to be exact--
which is the date your...

202
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,100
...article says those first
killings started.

203
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,200
Do you see the connection?

204
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,900
I'm not, uh... sure where you're
going with this, Agent Scully.

205
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,000
- The daughter is the connection.
- How is that?

206
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,300
I don't know exactly but these
killings only started up...

207
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,100
...since her burned body
has been found.

208
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,200
Honest to god. You just jump
at whatever explanation...

209
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,900
...is the wildest and most
far-fetched, don't you? 

210
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,400
Well, I suggest that
you jump at it, too...

211
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,300
...because her body may have been
burned for a reason...

212
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,300
...and you're going to want to
exhume it in order to find out why.

213
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,000
You want me to dig up
a dead body...

214
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,900
...when I have real people out there
whose lives are in real danger?

215
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
What did you say to him?

216
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,300
Well, I told him to dig up the body.
Isn't that what you wanted?

217
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,100
What else did you say to him?

218
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,900
Well, I told him that
you were... um... a...

219
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,800
...leading authority on
paranormal phenomena and...

220
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,600
...who are we to argue
with an expert.

221
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,800
Look, I am not an expert.

222
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,000
I am a scientist who happens
to have seen a lot.

223
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,400
I am just making a leap here.

224
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,700
Well, I am sure you have
your reasons.

225
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,700
Look, so, so, what,
you told him to exhume the body...

226
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,300
...when you don't even
necessarily believe me yourself?

227
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,900
I told you I spent the weekend...

228
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,800
...looking through that cabinet
full of X-Files...

229
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,800
...and I saw how pretty much every
X-File broke-- with a leap.

230
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,000
Now, maybe I'm just an old-fashioned cop
but I don't take leaps.

231
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,700
In my experience leaps only
get people killed.

232
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,800
Well, I'd say that you're taking a
pretty big leap believing in that article...

233
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,000
...about a human bat. 

234
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,600
I don't know how you do it.

235
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,400
Called the judge's order in
a half ago. You guys are fast.

236
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,500
Yep, we're really fast when
someone's done most of our work.

237
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,000
What are you talking about?

238
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,600
We got out here, somebody had
already dug up the box.

239
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,000
All we had to do was
haul it out.

240
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I don't know what they
were using...

241
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,500
...but they scratched up the wood
on the lid real good. See?

242
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,300
Let's get this down to the morgue.
I think the sooner, the better.

243
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,900
God!

244
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,500
I want a word with you.

245
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,500
Look, we listened to you.
The Detective listened to you.

246
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,100
We could have been out hunting
this thing down, Agent Doggett.

247
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,400
- You should be doing that now.
- Now?

248
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,500
Now's too late for
the Detective, isn't it?

249
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,400
Look, we don't need you telling us
what to do or your partner.

250
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,500
She's the one responsible
for this.

251
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,700
Nobody's responsible for this
except for whatever did it.

252
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,000
Look, I don't care who she is
or what she is, ...

253
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
...she's not touching that body.

254
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,800
We don't need her
far-out theories.

255
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,200
She's not welcome here.

256
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,500
What happened to the lynch mob?

257
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,200
You hear all that?

258
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,100
I heard enough.

259
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,800
Things have taken a little turn.

260
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,400
I don't think so, Agent Doggett.

261
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,900
Well, you can think what you want
but I think this looks bad for the FBI.

262
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,500
- It was unavoidable.
- How do you figure that?

263
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,000
This is the body pulled
from the river.

264
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,600
She died of natural causes--
congestive heart failure--

265
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,000
...but her body was only
burned afterwards.

266
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,900
- By who, and why burn it?
- Well, obviously to cover something up.

267
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,800
- Yeah, but what?
- That's what I still don't know.

268
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,800
Look, we know what we're
looking for.

269
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,900
We should be out there
looking for it.

270
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,900
We're not going to catch it
standing here speculating.

271
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,900
Look, it kills like an animal,
but with purpose.

272
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,900
It stalked the detective for
the same reason...

273
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,400
...that it stalked the old woman
and the undertaker.

274
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,000
Each of those victims had had
contact with this burnt body.

275
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,600
The undertaker prepared it.

276
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,500
Her mother ID'd it and the
Detective got the call when she was found.

277
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,100
Well, who else would have
had contact with it?

278
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,700
The, uh, man who found
her in the river.

279
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,600
A, uh, Myron Stefaniuk.

280
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,500
- Stefaniuk?
- Yeah.

281
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:58,200
One of the hunters in the photo in
1956 was Ernie Stefaniuk.

282
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,900
There's an address in his file.
I hope we're not too late.

283
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,500
Mr. Stefaniuk?

284
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,400
Myron Stefaniuk?

285
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,700
- That's me.
- Good. Sorry.

286
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,400
You gave us a bit of a scare.

287
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,800
We went to your home up the
road and we couldn't find you.

288
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,000
Why would that scare you?

289
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,800
Well, sir, we work with the FBI
and we have reason to believe...

290
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,000
- ...that your life may be in danger.
- I'm in danger?

291
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,700
Well, we're investigating
some murders, sir, ...

292
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,500
...that we believe may be connected to the
burnt body that you found recently.

293
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,100
I fished it out of the river.

294
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,700
- What have I got to do with anything?
- Well, we're not saying for sure that you do.

295
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,900
It may just be your
connection to the body.

296
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,500
There is no connection.
I just fished it out of the river.

297
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:15,600
- Well, sorry, sir, but that may be enough.
- It's nonsense. Leave me alone.

298
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,300
Ernie Stefaniuk.

299
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,900
Lived in Montana in 1956.
Do you know him?

300
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,900
Ernie was my brother.

301
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,300
He was one of three hunters that
killed a man that was half animal.

302
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,200
Please!
That was a long time ago.

303
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,800
Do you know where we can find him
to talk with him, sir?

304
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,900
My brother's dead.
That thing killed him.

305
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,300
Well, I have a newspaper story that
says your brother disappeared.

306
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,200
That was 40 years ago.

307
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,100
Leave it alone!
Leave me alone!

308
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,000
You know, we've been
out here for nine hours.

309
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,600
The only thing this man seems to be
in danger of is terminal loneliness.

310
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,300
Maybe I'm wrong.

311
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,300
Maybe this is all just a...

312
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,700
...a grand coincidence and we're
wasting our time out here.

313
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,800
You were so sure before.

314
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:49,300
Yeah, I was sure of the facts as
I had deduced them scientifically.

315
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,300
Maybe I'm... I'm trying
to force them into shape.

316
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,500
Maybe I'm manufacturing a theory.

317
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,500
Well, what happened to
taking a leap?

318
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,400
Maybe I'm just trying
too hard.

319
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,600
To do what?

320
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,900
To be Mulder?

321
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,800
You know,
I'm not Oxford educated.

322
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,100
About all I know about
the paranormal is...

323
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,300
...men are from Mars and
women are from Venus.

324
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,000
But I don't think you're
wrong, Agent Scully.

325
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,800
What makes you say that?

326
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,700
Well, I'm no Fox Mulder, ...

327
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,100
...but I can tell when a
man's hiding something.

328
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,300
Myron Stefaniuk fishes a woman
out of the river...

329
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,700
...who's been gone for 40 years.

330
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,900
He has a brother he hasn't
seen in over 40 years.

331
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,900
A brother who just happened to hunt
down some kind of creature...

332
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,000
...over 40 years ago.

333
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,300
Well, what does he have to hide?

334
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:56,300
Well, that's what I'm hoping this
good cop work is going to show us.

335
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,400
You there!

336
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,600
Stop right there!

337
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,700
I see him.

338
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,900
Stop where you are!

339
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,700
Put your hands up and out!

340
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,600
Now, turn around, slowly.

341
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,900
Are you Ernie Stefaniuk?

342
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Are you Ernie Stefaniuk?!

343
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,700
Yeah.

344
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,200
How's a man supposed to live...

345
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,500
...when his fear becomes obsession?

346
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,400
You'd do the same thing.

347
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,900
Who wouldn't who wanted to live?

348
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,300
You never left the island?

349
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:44,900
44 years-- I wouldn't dare
knowing it was out there.

350
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,300
That it could come back for me.

351
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,300
You know something about it?

352
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,600
About what this thing is?

353
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,000
I know on the evolutionary ladder...

354
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,600
...bats are real close by the apes...

355
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,800
...and just as we came
from the apes...

356
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,400
...so might a man,
sprung from a bat.

357
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,300
To live and hunt like a bat...

358
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,300
...but with the cold-blooded
vengeance of a man.

359
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,200
Even if that were true, sir, ...

360
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,900
...how could it possibly find you
out here on an island?

361
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,700
I needed to cut off all contact.

362
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,300
Communication could be
only one-way.

363
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,900
My brother helped me.

364
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,400
And then there was my wife.

365
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,600
It was her body your
brother pulled in.

366
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,500
She gave up everything
to be with me.

367
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,600
I forbade her to tell her mother.

368
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:04,100
44 years on six acres of island,
she made only one demand.

369
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,600
To be buried
in consecrated earth.

370
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,200
She was a Catholic
her whole life.

371
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,400
Mr. Stefaniuk...

372
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,100
It's killed four people.

373
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,300
All of whom would have had
traces of your scent...

374
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:41,100
...through various degrees of
contact with your wife's body.

375
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,100
- My brother?
- Your brother's okay, Ernie.

376
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:48,100
But he had contact with Ariel's body.
It'll come after him, too.

377
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,800
He's all right.
We spoke with him earlier today.

378
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,500
Today?

379
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,600
Today, he might have been fine but
this thing hunts likes a bat.

380
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,300
It only attacks at night.

381
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,400
Stay here.
Stay with him.

382
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,100
I still don't understand.

383
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,000
What's that?

384
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,600
- How'd you find me out here?
- We followed your brother.

385
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,300
No, I mean who figured it out?

386
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,900
I was sure that what we
were looking for...

387
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,000
...was something other than a man.

388
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,100
The detective who was running the case
didn't believe that, and...

389
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,600
...he's dead.

390
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,000
But your partner, he believed it?

391
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,200
I think he does now.

392
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,700
So it was you who figured it.

393
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,900
Well, I... I made the connections
but it was...

394
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,000
...Agent Doggett that got us out here.

395
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
You ought to be wishing he hadn't.

396
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
Excuse me?

397
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
The moment you stepped
foot here...

398
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,400
You're marked now,
you know that.

399
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,200
Sir, I'm here to protect you.

400
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,400
And how are you going to do that?

401
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,300
You thought of everything... Except that.

402
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,300
Well, this thing,
Mr. Stefaniuk is...

403
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,400
...still flesh and blood.
It can be killed.

404
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,500
What do you think? It's just going to
come walking through the door, there?

405
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,700
It's waited 44 years. It'll wait
out there as long as it takes...

406
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,200
...until you
can't stand it anymore.

407
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,800
How long can you wait, huh?
A lifetime?

408
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,200
To live in fear like this,
a young woman--

409
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,600
...are you prepared to
sacrifice family, ...

410
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:47,100
...children and spend your life
terrorized by a monster?

411
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,000
What is that?

412
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,600
It's ground radar.

413
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,800
The sensor's set at ten feet high.

414
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:07,400
Anything big enough to set it off
is coming in through the trees.

415
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,400
You hear it?

416
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,700
No.

417
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,800
Maybe I got it.

418
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,400
Maybe I killed it.

419
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,200
If you've got a gun, get it.

420
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,900
Agent Scully.

421
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,700
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

422
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,500
But you're not, Agent Doggett.

423
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
I got you.

424
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,600
TWO WEEKS LATER

425
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,600
Sorry I'm late.

426
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,600
I received a fax up in
my old office...

427
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,800
...from Ernie's brother,
Myron Stefaniuk.

428
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,000
He's alive? Where is he?

429
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,700
He doesn't say.

430
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,600
He sent this from a small
storefront business...

431
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,300
...just across the state
line in Wyoming.

432
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,700
He's gone into hiding. 

433
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,800
Do you believe it, Agent Doggett?

434
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,300
Believe it?

435
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,500
That this thing is still
out there and...

436
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,600
...someday it's going to
come after us?

437
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,600
I'm pretty sure I hit it,
Agent Scully.

438
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,100
Pretty sure you hit it, too.

439
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,700
The guys upstairs were making
some noise about this case--

440
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,100
...about what's in our field report.

441
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,300
Yeah.

442
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,000
You'll get used to it.

443
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,000
I, uh...

444
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,400
I never had a desk in here, ...

445
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:01,500
...Agent Doggett,
but I'll see that you get one.

446
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,000
All right.

447
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,100
And I just want to say, um...

448
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,400
Thank you for watching my back.

449
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,400
Well, I never saw it as an option.

450
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,300
I'm sure you don't either.
