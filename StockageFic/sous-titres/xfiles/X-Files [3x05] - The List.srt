00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,640
- Mr. Simon ? Are you ready ?
- Yeah.

2
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,720
Let's go.

3
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,000
Excuse me, Warden.
It's 5:00, sir.

4
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,120
- How's Neech ?
- He's still in with his wife.

5
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,120
No, I mean how is he ?
How's he doing ?

6
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,720
Well, he won't eat his meal,
and he won't see the chaplain.

7
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,920
- Told him to get the hell out.
- What about the hired man ?

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,560
He's traveling.

9
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,400
All right.
Let's get Neech prepped.

10
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,280
Yes, sir.

11
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,160
If God can't save his sorry ass,
neither can l.

13
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,240
Time's up, Neech !

14
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,240
2,000 volts, man.

15
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,200
You ain't never
coming back, freak!

[Woman] It's just like
I’ve always told you.

18
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,680
- I swear on my life, Neech.
- Time to go.

20
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,240
I ain't ever gonna love
another man.

21

You hear me ? I won't.

22
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,440
I won't betray our love.
Ever.

23
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,680
It's time, Neech.
Time to go.

24
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,440
That phone call's gonna come,

25
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,920
and the governor
is gonna come through.

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,760
Gotta go now.

We've got a hood
if you want it.

29
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,040
- It’s your option.
- No.

30
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,760
Is there anything
you want to say, Neech ?

31
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,840
Last words ?

32
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,960
Yeah.

33
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,680
I've been here 11 years, 56 days,
and now you’re gonna murder me.

34
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,120
The Lord says thou shall be
merciful and just.
I know no mercy.

35
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,280
Allah says the spirit
shall rise again...

36
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,320
and be reborn
into this life.

37
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,480
- The soul shall be recast,
- You should begin, Father.

38
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,400
-born unto new flesh.
- "The Lord is my shepherd--"

39
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,120
I will return to avenge
all the petty tyranny...

40
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,280
and the cruelty I have suffered.

41
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,880
I will be recast, reincarnated,

42
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,640
reunion of spirit and flesh.

43
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,760
Mark my words.

44
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,760
Five men will die.

45
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,480
- Save it.
- Five men will go down !

46
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,560
This will be my justice !
This will be my law !

47
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,640
This will be
my capital punishment,

48
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,480
and no stay of execution
will be granted,

49
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,920
for there is no prejudice,
no evidence to be admitted,

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,360
-no lawyer who did not
perform his job.
- Fry him.

51
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,840

righteous deaths !

-[Electricity Humming]

53
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,640
Napoleon "Neech" Manley.

54
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,160
He was convicted in 1 984
for double murder...

55
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,200
in the holdup
of a Florida liquor store.

56
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,240
The actual gunman
was killed in the pursuit.

57
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,000
Manley was driving
the getaway car and
got sentenced to death.

58
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,160
He was put to death in
the electric chair three days ago.

59
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,080
He'd been to the chair twice before,
but the governor granted him
last-minute stays.

60
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,440
Third time's a charm.
What's your interest in this ?

61
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,120
Manley was interesting.
He was well-read, charismatic.

62
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,240
He became a writer,
a kind of prison philosopher.

63
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,280
A week before his execution,
word went through the prison...

64
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,360
that Neech said he was
gonna be reincarnated.

65
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,400
He was gonna come back
from the dead.

66
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,680
Well, reincarnation has always
been popular on death row
for obvious reasons.

67
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,360
Apparently, this was more than just
a dying man's hope against hope.

68
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,360
- What do you mean ?
- Manley didn’t just claim
that he was gonna come back,

69
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,720
but that he was gonna take vengeance
on five men who had mistreated him.

70
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,480
Yesterday a death row guard was
found dead inside the cell...

71
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,040
that Manley had occupied
those 11 years.

72
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,080
His death cannot be explained.

73
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,680
[Scully]
Has a cause of death been determined?

74
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,400
Suffocation,
near as we can tell.

75
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,000
Somebody must have
snuffed him with a pillow.

76
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,000
[Mulder] Any idea how one of
your guards could get murdered...

77
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,040
in an empty cell like this ?

78
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,640
No. It's not supposed to happen,
not with all the precautions
we're taking.

79
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,600
I see the guards here
all wear panic devices.
Was the victim's activated ?

80
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,800
No. Apparently,
he never touched it.

81
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,840
[Mulder] According to our reports,
there were threats this might happen.

82
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,840
There's always
threats of violence in here.

83
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,360
Prison's nothing but
a police state, basically.

84
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,360
Do you give any credence
to Neech Manley's claims...

85
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,720
that he was gonna come back
and take revenge ?

86
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,760
Neech Manley. Hmm.

87
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,640
A smart man.
Very smart man.

88
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,520
In fact, if he’d stayed outside,
I would have figured him
for a Nobel Prize.

89
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,240
But he made a mistake.
Paid for it with his life.

90
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,600
A man of that intelligence,
you put him inside for 10 or 11 years,

91
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,600
you're gonna have
to pay for it.

92
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,920
- What do you mean ?
- There's nothing but bitterness
and resentment in here...

93
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,240
7 days a week, 24 hours a day,
365 days a year.

94
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,360
It gets honed
to a real fine point.

95
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,360
So you’re saying that
Manley planned this...

96
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,240
and is carrying it out
with the help of someone else.

97
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,720
Elaborate as Shakespeare.

98
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,920
Now, if you want to see
the victim's body--

99
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,360
[Guard]
Visitors coming through !
Woman on the block !

100
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,720
We're holding the corpse
until the state pathologist...

101
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,640
comes down this afternoon
and conducts the official autopsy.

102
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,720
That information should
help us solve the murder.

103
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,320
[Mulder] Did Manley have
many friends among the prisoners ?

104
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,080
A man has to have friends in prison
to keep an eye on his enemies.

105
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,400
A man has to have friends in prison
to keep an eye on his enemies.

106
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,760
- Mostly, people were
just afraid of him.
- Warden ?

107
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,320
- What is it ?
- The body.

108
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,920
I think you should
take a look.

109
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,080
I suggest you get it
into refrigeration,

110
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,640
or you're not gonna have
anything left to autopsy.

111
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,720
Oh, God.

112
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,640
[Mulder] I’ve been told
you believe Neech Manley's claims.

113
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,760
It's not a matter of how
or if he’s coming back.

114
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,520
The question is, when...

115
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,040
- is he coming back again ?
- What are you saying,
Speranza ?

116
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,120
You believe Manley
killed that guard ?

117
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,440
- How would you explain it ?
- A prisoner waits for
an opportunity--

118
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,440
Hey, look around.
We ain't got but an opportunity...

119
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,480
to itchy-scratchy
outside our cells.

120
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,160
Yeah, but you’ve got prisoners
on work detail. Trustees.
A man slips away.

121
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,880
This is "Q" block, death row.
Don't nobody come in and out of here...

122
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,880
without a guard watching,
and lately, you got double that.

123
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,200
Why ?

124
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,640
'Cause everybody's afraid
of what they say can't be true.

125
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,840
- Neech is back.
- Reincarnated.

126
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,400
Well, he would have called it
"transmigration of the soul."

127
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,000
- Into what form ?
- You, me, this mattress--
I don't know.

128
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,040
He didn't specify,
but he's back.

129
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,680
I can feel it.

130
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,240
The man was electric,
you know what I'm saying ?
Pure energy.

131
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,560
Would it be possible
to see the cell where
the guard was murdered ?

132
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,240
I'll open it up for you.

133
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,160

-[Wolf Whistle]
-[Man]
Yeah, sweet roja !

135
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,920
Nothing's been touched.
It's pretty much the way Neech left it.

137
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,560
- Did you know Neech Manley ?
- Oh, yeah. I knew him.

138
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,560
- What was he like ?
- Neech ?

139
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,440
- Neech was so full of B.S.,
he couldn't stand it.
- How is that ?

140
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,840
He actually started to believe that crap
he'd been preaching all those years,

141
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,640
as if knowing all them religions
made him some kind of god.

142
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,960
- Who do you think
killed the guard ?
- I don't know who killed him,

143
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,560
but I damn well know
who didn't kill him.

144
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,720
Are you afraid at all ?

145
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,040
Me ? I just keep my ass covered
and my eyes peeled.

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,560
I know who he's going to kill.

154

There's a list.
One of the cons has it.

Not a place for a woman
to be doing that alone.

- Okay. I'll be right there.

- Guard !
- What's wrong, Scully ?

[Man Laughing]

167
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,920
[Guard] I want every paintbrush
and putty knife...

168
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,080
to be accounted for,
understand?

169
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,360
Come on, gentlemen,
move it.

170
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,680
It's the guard.
It's Fornier.

171
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,880
Come on, you guys.
Break it up.

172
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,920
Get back.

173
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
I said get back.

174
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,600
I guess they haven't
recovered the body yet,

175
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,200
so it's going to be difficult
to establish an exact cause of death.

176
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,760
What did your
preliminary exam turn up ?

177
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,440
Well, it looks like the head
was severed just below the jaw line...

178
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,360
with repeated stabbing blows
from a putty knife.

179
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,200
There were no other indications
of trauma to the head.

180
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,600
From the eyewitness reports,
there were already fly larvae
infesting the flesh.

181
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,520
That seems unusual,
considering the short
time-of-death window.

182
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,960
Not altogether.
Here, let me show you this.

183
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,600
Lucilia Cuprina, better known as
the green bottle fly.

184
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,400
They can lay their eggs
within a minute after death occurs,

185
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,000
and they breed more rapidly
in a hot, humid environment.

186
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,240
In the anaerobic environment
inside the paint can ?

187
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,480
On my autopsy
on the first victim,

188
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,040
the lungs were absolutely
alive with infestation.

189
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,600
Hmm. What was determined to be
the cause of that death ?

190
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,000
Best I can figure,
given the lack of indicators,
he was suffocated to death.

191
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,160
Either that...
or he drowned.

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,320
[Guard]
You've got a visitor, Roque.

194
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:38,240
- I hear you have a list.
- I prefer not to talk about it here.

195
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,280
Not on the block.

196
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,320

197
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,960
You's a dead man, Roque!
You hear me ?

198
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,720
I'm gonna peel that head
like an onion!

199
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,480
I'm gonna break you off
a big chunk! You hear me ?

200
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,840
He ain't gonna tell you
nothing but a bunch of lies !

201
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,960
You talk, punk,
I gonna make you my Maytag !

202
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,960
He's a liar !

203
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,960
How did you come by
this list you claim to have ?

204
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,400
I heard Neech on the bars one night
telling Speranza.

205
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,400
- How many names are on the list ?
- Five.

206
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,720
just like Neech said.

207
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,160
So you knew those two guards
were gonna be murdered.

208
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,040
I knew they were
on the list, yeah.

209
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,040
Who do you think killed them ?

210
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,040
I don't know.

211
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,400
I just know
who's on the list.

212
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,920
You want to make
some kind of deal, huh ?

213
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,880
That's right.
I want a transfer out of this hole.

214
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,920
Why ? Are you on the list ?

215
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,320
I ain't saying nothing.

216
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,440
Not until I get my deal.

217
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,080
Well, what if they don't
give you what you want ?

218
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,920
Then they're gonna see
the other three die.

219
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,040
- Can't do it.
I can't make that deal.
- You don't have the authority ?

220
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,160
No. If I make that deal,
I might as well go into
the deal-making business.

221
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,560
Every con with half a brain
would come up with a scheme like that.

222
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,560
What if it saves three lives ?
Isn't that a deal worth making ?

223
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,560
Look, my job is about
controlling anarchy.

224
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,080
I don't run this prison.
I just patrol it.

225
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,120
Basically,
it's war in here.

226
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,120
We have freedom.
They don't.

227
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,640
Anything these men want,
somehow it finds its way in here.

228
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,920
They want another prisoner dead,
somebody's gonna find a way
to put a shiv in.

229
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,720
These aren't prisoners.
These are guards
you've got being murdered.

230
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,960
Yes, and if I back down now,
all I'll be doing...

231
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,800
is sending a message about
the benefits of killing prison guards.

232
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,120
There’s a conspiracy
at work here.

233
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,120
I don't know
who's behind it.

234
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,320
But I am gonna crack it.
That's my job.

235
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,320
Ohh-- What the hell ?
Guard !

236
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,880
Guard ! Guard ! Get in here !

237
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,800
I guess he'll be able to finish up
that autopsy now, Scully.

238
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,720
[Scully]
He had quite a library.

239
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,720
[Mulder]
Yeah.

240
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,640
Looks like Neech Manley
knew his Bible.

241
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,200
Listen to this.

242
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,480
"I come in return
to the beginning of the end...

243
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,760
"to begin again
the journey of souls,

244
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,520
the godhead universal for whom
there is no death, only life eternal."

245
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,680
- What's that from ?
- Neech Manley, 1994.

246
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,000
This stuff goes on for pages.
There's references to the Hindu Atman,

247
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,000
Prarabdha, the Rosicrucians,
Zoroastrianism.

248
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,040
The man was obsessed
with reincarnation.

249
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,160
Being obsessed with it
doesn't mean you can do it.

250
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,200
Unless he knew
something we don't.

251
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,120
Like what ?
The secret password ?

252
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,000
Every major world religion encompasses
the idea of life after death.

253
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,280
That means millions of people believe
in some kind of transmigration...

254
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,240
or rebirth of the soul.

255
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,040
I'm sorry, Mulder.
That's not what I learned in catechism.

256
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,680
Well, even Christianity
teaches about the resurrection...

257
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,760
and ascendancy
of the heavenly body.

258
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,560
Do you honestly believe that
Neech Manley came back from
the dead to kill those two men ?

259
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,400
- Is there another theory ?
- A very good one,
and one much more believable.

260
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,400
That this is
a complex scheme,

261
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,000
that the headless man planted
behind the warden's desk...

262
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,040
is the work of
a conspiracy of inmates.

263
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,680
Or guards.

264
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,920
Okay, but imagine
if it were true, Scully.

265
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,440
Imagine if you could come back
and take out five people
who had caused you to suffer.

266
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,680
- Who would they be ?
- I only get five ?

267
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,120
I remembered your birthday
this year, didn't l, Scully ?

268
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,720
Well, here’s somebody
we haven’t talked to yet.

- She should know better
than anybody else.

- Yes ?

We’d like to ask you a few questions
about your husband.

273

They put Neech
in that chair,

276
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,120
then they
flipped the switch,

277
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
but that he wouldn't die.

278
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,240
They couldn't kill him.

279
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,640
He's a powerful man.

280
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,840
-A very powerful man.
- Did he share his thoughts
about dying with you ?

281
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,360
Neech wasn't afraid to die.

282
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,520
Because of his beliefs ?

283
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,520

But sometimes...

288
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,920
I could feel
the power of his beliefs...

on death row, Warden ?

Did you catch
her body language ?

313

She was nervous...
or scared.

Of what ? That her husband's
gonna keep his word ?

315
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,840
A lot could have happened in her life
in those 11 years Neech was in prison.

316
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,120
- A lot probably did.
- You mean she thinks
she's on the list ?

333
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,640

l-l mean, what if--

334
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,840
Will you stop
your worrying ?

335
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,960

all right. Hmm ?

He ain't coming back,
Danielle.

337
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,120
He ain't.

338
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,560
Hey. Hey, you movin' in ?

339
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,080
Got room in my cell
for you, baby.

340
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,080
- Who found the body ?
- One of my guards.

341
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,920
- No one heard anything ?
- Nobody who should have.

342
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,800
I'm ordering a lockdown of this facility
until the situation is under control.

343
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,920
As far as I'm concerned, anyone
who had contact with Neech Manley...

344
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,960
is a suspect.

345
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,640
Warden ?

346
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,840
[Parmelly]
I warned you.

347
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,920
That's three.

348
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,240
Warden ?

349
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,600
Why Roque ?

350
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,600
Neech hated Roque.

351
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,560
They pretty near tried
to kill each other once.

352
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,800
- Then why the other victims ?
- Neech probably hated them too.

353
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,080
Did Neech have a history
with the guards who died ?

354
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,400
Neech had a small
behavioral problem...

355
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,760
about a year,
a year and a half ago.

356
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,120
Fornier and the other men
had to, uh, discipline him.

357
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,160
How badly was he beaten ?

358
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,920
- He took his licks.
- So there's a pattern here.

359
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,360
A logic. All these men had
a violent history with Neech.

360
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,800
They all caused him
to suffer physical pain.

361
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,200
- What are you getting at ?
- A lockdown may not
solve your problem, Warden.

362
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,200
- Sure as hell put a lid on it.
- If it’s a conspiracy
among the inmates.

363
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,280
But how many inmates could have
put that body in your office ?

364
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,520
How many
could have gotten access ?

365
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,520
You're saying
the guards are involved ?

366
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,480
I'm saying that Roque
may not be victim number three.

367
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,680
Now, I need a name from you.

368
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,840
I need the name
of Neech's executioner.

369
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,040
- It's confidential.
- How many men know it ?

370
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,040
Three men, including me.

371
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,040
We place an ad,
pay him in cash.

372
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,880
- There's no written record.
- His life may be in danger.

373
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,360
- There is no chance--
- Look at it this way, Warden.

374
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,240
If I'm right, it'll reduce
your list of suspects to four.

375
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,120
I said three men
knew that name.

I’ve just been going over Neech's
phone calls over the last two months.

403
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,080
Over 30 of them were made
to a man named Danny Charez,

- twice as many as to his own wife.
- And ?

405

Charez has been here three times
to see Speranza since the first murder.

Okay, then. What's your business
with John Speranza ?

409
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,680
I was trying
to get Speranza a deal.

410
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,400
- What kind of deal ?
- Retrial maybe.

411

Reopen the case.
I got some connections
with the government.

412

413
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,880
I used to be an attorney.

You were Neech Manley's
defense lawyer?

416
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,200
I was 26.
I was court-appointed.

417
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,520
I had no business
on a death-penalty case.

418
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,920
Why help Speranza now ?

419
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,960
I heard about Neech's death list.
Word gets around.

And I know he blames me
for him getting fried,

421
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,000
so I figured
I got to try something.

got some sway with Neech ?

I've been to the governor,
