00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,240
You had sex
with these women ?

165
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,280
How is it that none of them
have any recollection,
whatsoever, of that happening ?

166
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,240
Look, I'm not saying anything
one way or another.

167
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,840
I'm just sayin',
hypothetically,

168
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,560
if some woman wanted to have kids
and their husbands weren't capable,

169
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,600
and everybody was happy,
and nobody got hurt,

170
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,240
hypothetically,
where's the crime ?

171
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,880
If you’re waitin' for my usual theory
as to what's goin' on, I don't have one.

172
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,880
I do. On behalf of all
the women in the world,

173
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,440
I seriously doubt
this has anything to do
with consensual sex.

174
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,200
I think it involved some
form of Rohypnol-rape.

175
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,320
- The tranquilizer ?
I didn't think of that.
- Called the "date rape drug."

176
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,960
High doses of it cause a loosening
of inhibitions, memory loss.

177
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,440
Now if Van Blundht was somehow
able to slip the drug to these women,

178
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,120
especially in conjunction
with alcohol--

179
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,320
Yeah, but when would he have had
the opportunity to slip it to them ?

180
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,120
He identified these women through
his janitorial job at the Medical Park.

181
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,640
He could've followed them
anywhere, to a club, to a bar.

182
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,920
Those women don't look like the type
that do a lot of solo drinking.

183
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I think it's enough to keep him
in custody while we check it out.

184
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,440
Ah, you spelled
my name wrong.

[ Bell Rings ]

201
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,040
I found Van Blundht's clothes
in the locker room.

202
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,600
He must've walked out of here
wearing the deputy's spare uniform.

203
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,840
After hitting him
over the head.

204
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,120
I have a theory.
Do you want to hear it ?

205
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,960
Van Blundht somehow physically
transformed into his captor,

206
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,360
then walked out the door
leaving no one the wiser ?

207
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,880
Should we be pickin' out
china patterns or what ?

208
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,280
Why can't you just
go for the simple answer ?

209
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,720
With that blow to the head,
the deputy might have identified...

210
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,560
- McGruff the Crime Dog as his attacker.
- What about what the sheriff saw ?

211
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,640
Two men, roughly the same build,
the same coloring,

212
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,520
the addition of the uniform goes
a long way to explain how someone...

213
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,520
can mistake one man for another
at 3:00 in the morning.

214
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,520
Conversely, my theory
goes a long way to explaining...

215
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,320
how four married women could
mistake Van Blundht for their husbands,

216
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,920
and how Amanda Nelligan
could think he was Luke Skywalker.

217

We've both seen something
like this before, Scully.

If this musculature

00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,560
There ain't nobody else here.
You must be lookin' at me.

492
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,680
You want a piece of this ?

493
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,960
[ Sighs ]
You're a damn good-lookin' man.

494
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,680
[Knocking On Door]

495
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,400
- Mulder, what's up ?
- Scully, is this a bad time ?

496
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,200
No. No, I'm--
Come on in.

497
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,040
Who's that for ?

498
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,240
Uh... us.

499
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,320
Okay, have a seat.

500
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,920
So, uh,
what are you workin' on ?

501
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,400
More autopsy data.

502
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,200
Everyone at the lab found
Mr. Van Blundht pretty fascinating.

503
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:27,920
We discovered an additional
anomaly relating to the
hair follicles in his scalp.

504
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,520
I can't even begin to guess
at the nature of it...

505
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,680
until we can run it through
the transmission electron microscope.

506
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,880
Sounds very interesting.

507
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,120
Yes, it is.

508
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,880
Seriously, Mulder.
What's going on ?

509
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,840
- You okay ?
- Mmm.

510
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,000
Just kind a knockin' around,

511
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,040
and was just thinkin'--

512
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,360
[ Coughs ]
Uh, it's good.

513
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,120
We never really, uh,

514
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,480
talk much,

515
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,880
- do we ?
- What do you mean ?
Like... really talk ?

516
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,920
No, no, we don't, Mulder.

517
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,400
What's stopping us ?

518
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,640
So there we are
at 2:00 in the morning,

519
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,160
me in my Moray taffeta dress
and Marcus in whatever
the hell he was wearing--

520
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,280
Thank you very much.

521
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:50,400
It had a Kelly green
cummerbund on it.

522
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,960
Anyway, so I know that Marcus
is thinking that it's now or never.

523
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,200
- And I'm thinking--
- What are you thinking ?

524
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,880
- I'm thinking what is that siren
I hear getting louder ?
- No way !

525
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,240
- Who called the cops ?
- It wasn't the cops.
It was the fire department.

526
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,520
- My friend Sylvia
and her idiot prom date--
- Burwood ?

527
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,080
Had built this campfire that
went totally out of control.

528
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,560
And so we all had to ride back
on the, uh--

529
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,240
What do you call it ?
The, uh, the pumper truck.

530
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,880
Geez.

531
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,640
Yeah. Marcus was
the twelfth grade love of my life.

532
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,960
I can't believe
I'm telling you this.

533
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,600
I don't believe you
haven't told me before.

534
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,200
Now I'm seeing a whole
new side of you, Mulder.

535
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,240
Is that a good thing ?

536
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,680
I like it.

537
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,280
Do you ever wish things
were different ?

538
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,040
What do you mean ?

539
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,200
The person you wanted to be when you
grew up, when you were in high school ?

540
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,320
How far off from that
did you end up ?

541
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,640
Career wise ?
Miles off target.

542
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,040
Not just that.

543
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,800
But do you ever wish...

544
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,000
that you could go back
and do it all differently ?

545
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,720
Do you ?

546
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,960
[ Gasps ]

547
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,920
[ Door Buzzes ]

548
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,080
Thanks for comin'.

549
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,480
What's with the hat ?

550
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,240
My court-appointed therapist
makes me wear it.

551
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,880
She says it's meant
to bolster my self-esteem.

552
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,720
Does it ?

553
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,760
Not really. The other inmates
beat me up and take it from me,

554
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,560
which would be okay except
every week she brings me a new hat.

555
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,400
plus, they keep me on
some kind of muscle relaxant...

556
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,640
so l, I can't make faces
the way I used to.

557
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,560
Did you tell them to do that ?

558
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,280
Is, uh, is Agent Scully here ?

559
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,560
What did you wanna
talk to me about, Eddie ?

560
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,400
I just think it's funny.

561
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,080
I was born a loser,
but you’re one by choice.

562
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,320
On what do you base
that astute assessment ?

563
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,320
Experience.

564
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,880
You should live a little.
Treat yourself.

565
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,880
God knows I would
if I were you.

566
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,360
[Door Buzzes]

567
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,720
Have a good day, sir.

568
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,360
I don't imagine you need to be told
this, Mulder, but you’re not a loser.

569
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:55,720
Yeah, but I'm no
Eddie Van Blundht, either, am I ?
