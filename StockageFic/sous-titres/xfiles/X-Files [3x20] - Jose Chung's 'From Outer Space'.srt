00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,240
That's my problem with it.
It's all a little too typical.

170
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,760
Abduction lore has
become so prevalent in our society...

171
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,240
that you can ask someone to imagine
what it would be like to be abducted...

172
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,320

an identical scenario.

Yeah, if it were
only one person,

verifying the other's story.

You really bleeped up this case.

say "bleeped." He said--

to confirm his alibi.

He was just talking.

I don't know where I was taken,
because the whole time
I was like this... in pain.

212
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,920
Because the other alien was conducting
tortuous experiments on you ?

you're a kid and you tore the

I guess I was the bug.

215
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,240
Anyways, the next thing I remember
I was suddenly out side,

216
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,560
Like I was flying through
the air or something.

217

- Then I think I hit the ground.

ran to Chrissy's to make sure
she was there and she was okay.

Harold, did you
and Chrissy engage...

220
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,240
in consensual sexual
intercourse that night ?

221
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,160
If her father finds out,
I'm a dead man.

222
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,640
He said it happened before the
abduction. So what if they had sex ?

223
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,360
So we know it wasn't
an alien that probed her.

224
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,360
You've got two kids having sex
before they're mature enough
to know how to handle it.

225
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,200
You're saying all this is just a case
of sexual trauma ?

226
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,200
It's a lot more plausible
than an alien abduction,

227
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,880
especially in light of
their contradictory stories.

228
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,840
Hey ! I just got a call
from some crazy bleep-head,

229
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,680
claiming he was an eyewitness
to this alien abduction.

230
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,320
You feel like talking
to this blank-hole ?

231
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:04,240
I know how crazy all this sounds,
but I don't care.

232
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,640
What I have to say
has to be said.

233
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,440
Why did you wait till now to tell us
this information ?

234
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,880
Two kids' lives
may be affected by it.

It's bigger than
a couple of kids.

236
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,120
It has to do with the entire planet,
the universe, and who knows what all.

what happened that night ?

This. It's all here.

After seeing what I saw
that night, I rushed right home
and wrote it all down--

48 hours straight-- I didn't
want to forget a single detail.

But I feel that
I should warn you.

I don’t want to be dramatic,
but by looking at this, you're
putting your lives in danger.

00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:46,560
- Why is that ?
- Because last night,
the weirdest thing happened.

That was when I realized
something was weird.

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,840
At which point ?

250
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,880
Normally, if two strangers
drive into my garage,

251
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,080
I'd tell them to get the hell off
the property, but this time I didn't.

252
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,040
It was like
I was in a trance.

253
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,200
- What did these men look like ?
- Usually I'm really good with faces.

is how they were dressed.

- All in black ?

close encounters of reported

in black.

myths about men in black garments...

have been recorded throughout history
in many different cultures.

261
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,200
The Celtic legends are filled
with trickster men in black...

262
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,440
and how anyone who encounters
them becomes enchanted.

263
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,040
Unfortunately, I'm not sure the modern
reconstruction of ancient fairy tales...

264
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,760
Lends any more credence
to Roky's testimony.

up in the sky other than Venus.

it was Venus.

Your scientists have yet to
discover how neural networks
create self-consciousness,

two-dimensional retinal images...

into the three-dimensional
phenomenon known as perception.

flaunt your ignorance...

- One was sent to my publisher's.

316
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,000
I don't know what
was most disturbing:

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,040
his description of
the inner core...

318

reincarnated souls'
sex orgy...

319
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,560
or the fact that the whole thing
is written in screenplay format.

320
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
It definitely was peculiar.

00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,840

Well, Mulder's had his share

he isn't delusional.

state was triggered by something
he witnessed that night.

add up is the girl's.

So the girl was put under again...

to see if she could confirm
any of the boy's story.

As I suspected she might
under such conditions, she did.

I'm like this.

Some are in uniforms.
Some are in suits.

The one closest to me looks
like a doctor. He's talking tome.

What is he saying ?

They seem to be arguing.

Ask her if this third alien
had a Russian accent.

This is way beyond

Ask if she knows where
the gray alien's saucer went to.

- How is she gonna know that ?
- Have we located any of the others ?

this is for the good of my country.

Mulder, you and the
hypnotherapist were leading her.

There was more confabulation
in the second version than in the first.

I think you’re
wrong about that.

But you’re right about one
thing. This case might not have
anything to do with aliens.

a real-live dead alien body.

in the field that night ?

Looking for U.F.O.s.

[Man's Voice] There’d been
recent sightings in that area,

get my video camera then,

[Chung's Voice]
What was wrong with doing that ?

[Man's Voice] Because
the proper authorities showed up
with a couple of men in black.

One of them was disguised as a woman,
but wasn't pulling it off.

an ordinary bunch of doctors...

and then come out absolutely positive
they were probed by aliens.

But if abductions are just a covert
intelligence operation...

secret military airships piloted
by aliens, such as yourself,

as F.B.I. Agent Mulder.

You ever seen a U.F.O.
in these parts ?

526
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,160
He then ordered piece after piece,
each time asking another question.

527
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,560
You ever experienced
a period of missing time ?

528

My friend never
saw him again.

534

Lieutenant Sheaffer, let alone
any other Air Force personnel.

You seem non-nonplussed

and got back to the motel.

Mulder, these gentlemen have
something important to tell you.

543
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,280
Some alien encounters are hoaxes
perpetrated by your government
to manipulate the public.

544

Some of these hoaxes
are intentionally revealed to
manipulate the truth seekers...

the deliberately absurd deception.

Similar things are said
about the men in black.

They purposely dress
and behave strangely,

548

an encounter with them,
they sound like a lunatic.

remember letting you in.
