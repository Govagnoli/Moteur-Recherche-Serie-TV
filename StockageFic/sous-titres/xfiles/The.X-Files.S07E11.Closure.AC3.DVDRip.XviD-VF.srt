1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,843
They said the birds refused to sing...

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,606
and the thermometer
fell suddenly,

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,706
as if God himself
had his breath stolen away.

4
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,224
No one there dared
speak aloud,

5
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,885
as much in shame
as in sorrow.

6
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:31,260
They uncovered the bodies
one by one.

7
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,765
The eyes of the dead
were closed,

8
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,199
as if waiting for permission
to open them.

9
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:41,503
Were they still dreaming
of ice cream and monkey bars,

10
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:45,476
of birthday cake and
no future but the afternoon?

11
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,106
Or had their innocence been
taken along with their lives,

12
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:52,379
buried in the cold earth
so long ago?

13
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:58,446
These fates seemed too cruel,
even for God to allow.

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,860
Or are the tragic young born again
when the world's not looking?

15
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:10,830
I wanna believe so badly
in a truth beyond our own,

16
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,670
hidden and obscured from all
but the most sensitive eyes.

17
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,715
In the endless procession
of souls,

18
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:31,780
in what cannot and
will not be destroyed,

19
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:41,032
I want to believe we are unaware of
God's eternal recompense and sadness...

20
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,265
that we cannot see his truth.

21
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,373
That that which is born still lives
and cannot be buried in the cold earth,

22
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:58,951
but only waits to be born again
at God's behest...

23
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,515
where in ancient starlight
we lay...

24
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,526
in repose.

25
00:03:23,768 --> 00:03:26,999
Ed Truelove was 19 when
he committed his first murder.

26
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:30,098
He was working as a janitor
at an elementary school...

27
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:33,303
and they needed someone
to play Santa Claus.

28
00:03:33,378 --> 00:03:35,903
He never got over
the feelings it aroused.

29
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,448
He's admitted to
all of it, Mulder...

30
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:40,780
24 separate murders.

31
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:47,691
But he refuses to take blame
for Amber Lynn LaPierre.

32
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:52,994
I was just handed the
preliminary forensics report.

33
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:57,394
Her body was not one of
those found in the graves.

34
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:03,140
Mulder, I know you wanted
to find her out there.

35
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:06,371
He's got hours of video
of her.

36
00:04:06,444 --> 00:04:08,605
I'm talking about your sister.

37
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:17,653
- I know that's who you're looking for.
- Yeah.

38
00:04:17,722 --> 00:04:21,818
You don't know how badly I wanted her
to be in one of those graves.

39
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:26,125
Hard as it is to admit, I wanted
to find her here riding her bike
like all these other kids.

40
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,668
I guess I just want it
to be over.

41
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:36,397
-  Agent Mulder, Scully.

42
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:38,965
There's a Mr. Harold Piller
here to see you.

43
00:04:52,824 --> 00:04:56,658
- Mr. Piller?
- Agent Mulder.

44
00:04:56,728 --> 00:04:59,094
- Agent Scully.
- Do we know each other?

45
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:02,327
Not personally, no. But I'm happy
to meet you. Hi. Harold Piller.

46
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,028
Mr. Piller, are you part
of this investigation?

47
00:05:05,103 --> 00:05:07,367
Yes, I hope to be.

48
00:05:07,438 --> 00:05:11,135
- How can we help you?
- I was hoping to help you.

49
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:15,338
You're a police psychic.

50
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:17,347
My references are on the back.

51
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,817
I've gotten some strong
hits off this case.

52
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:24,116
You're looking for
a little girl,

53
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:27,022
but she's not among
the dead.

54
00:05:27,091 --> 00:05:29,491
Your suspect is going
to say he didn't kill her.

55
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:31,461
Did he?

56
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:35,021
No. I think I can help find her.

57
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:38,466
Mr. Piller, you have
some interesting references here.

58
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:42,404
You've worked with law enforcements
in Kashmir, India, Myanmar,

59
00:05:42,473 --> 00:05:44,737
Afghanistan, Pakistan,
Khyber Pass.

60
00:05:44,809 --> 00:05:47,744
That was a train wreck...
a horrible tragedy.

61
00:05:47,812 --> 00:05:51,578
They called me in to locate the bodies
of seven children who were unrecovered.

62
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:54,675
- And did you recover them?
- I didn't recover them, no.

63
00:05:54,752 --> 00:05:57,687
- But I explained what happened.
- What happened?

64
00:05:57,755 --> 00:06:02,158
The children's bodies were transported
from the accident site...

65
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:06,027
by a spiritual intervention,
what are known as walk-ins.

66
00:06:06,097 --> 00:06:09,191
Thank you, Mr. Piller,
but we have real work to be done.

67
00:06:11,502 --> 00:06:14,994
I've studied this phenomenon
the world over...

68
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:19,271
at mud slides in Peru,
earthquakes in Uzbekistan.

69
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:22,507
Kids' bodies never found,
never accounted for in any other way.

70
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,946
What happened to them?

71
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:28,076
The bodies were transported
from the various sites...

72
00:06:28,152 --> 00:06:30,086
in starlight.

73
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:34,458
Please excuse us. Mulder?

74
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,557
- Mulder, please.
- What is it?

75
00:06:39,631 --> 00:06:42,498
Mulder, you have been through
so much in such a short time...

76
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:45,968
the death of your mother
and the feelings it's
brought up for your sister.

77
00:06:46,037 --> 00:06:48,403
You're vulnerable right now.

78
00:06:48,473 --> 00:06:52,239
We still have a missing body...
Amber Lynn LaPierre.
She may be alive. We don't know.

79
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,609
But this man isn't gonna
help us find her, by his own admission.

80
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,911
It's not the first time
I've heard what he's saying...

81
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:01,645
about the intervention
of these walking spirits.

82
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:04,745
Kathy Lee Tencate mentioned
it to me in the prison.

83
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:08,189
- She said that's who took her son.
- Because it's foolproof, Mulder.

84
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:10,989
Nobody is gonna disprove it
if there's no body.

85
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:12,996
And that's exactly
what this man does.

86
00:07:13,064 --> 00:07:15,794
He gives a comforting
explanation at a train wreck...

87
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:17,835
or an earthquake
that everyone can live with.

88
00:07:17,902 --> 00:07:20,735
But the fact is
the bodies are still buried.

89
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:22,739
Or maybe they are
somewhere else.

90
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:27,103
Like your sister?

91
00:07:27,178 --> 00:07:29,408
Mulder,

92
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,938
you told me that all you wanted
was for this to be over.

93
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:35,008
I do.

94
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:37,384
I do.

95
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:40,913
Well, then I'm going
back to Washington.

96
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:43,927
There's nothing more
to be done here.

97
00:08:00,211 --> 00:08:02,406
How long have you
been doing this?

98
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,880
A few years.

99
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:11,052
I have a son who disappeared
under strange circumstances.

100
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:15,786
He's never been found.

101
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,627
And then one day, I just...
started to see them.

102
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:24,897
These walk-ins,
you say they...

103
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:27,733
they come and take
the children.

104
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:30,330
- Why?
- In almost every case,

105
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:33,673
the parents had
a precognitive image...

106
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:35,770
of their child dead.

107
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:39,675
Horrible visions.

108
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:44,745
I believe what this is
is the work of good spirits...

109
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,120
foretelling their fates.

110
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:50,922
A fate the child
was about to meet,

111
00:08:50,995 --> 00:08:55,022
a particularly violent fate
that wasn't meant to be.

112
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:58,000
Which is why
the spirits intervened,

113
00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:00,663
transforming matter
into pure energy.

114
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,370
Starlight.

115
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:09,538
But it's not
what happened here.

116
00:09:09,614 --> 00:09:11,741
How do you know that?

117
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:15,513
Because these children
all died suffering,

118
00:09:15,586 --> 00:09:19,113
pleading innocently
for their lives.

119
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,356
These beautiful children,
so... trusting and pure.

120
00:09:27,765 --> 00:09:29,824
I see them.

121
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:32,870
My God, why?

122
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:35,531
Why must some suffer
and not others?

123
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:40,910
You see them?
Do you see Amber Lynn LaPierre?

124
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,574
She wasn't here.
She never was.

125
00:09:46,884 --> 00:09:50,684
But I'm... I'm sensing
a connection with her...

126
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:53,690
to this place.

127
00:09:55,526 --> 00:09:58,394
No, it's a connection to...

128
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:03,729
- It's a connection to you.
- How's that?

129
00:10:10,873 --> 00:10:13,433
You lost someone
close to you.

130
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:16,034
Ayoung girl.

131
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:20,172
It happened a...
a long time ago.

132
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:24,412
Your sister.

133
00:10:26,822 --> 00:10:30,918
There's a connection
between these girls, isn't there?

134
00:10:30,993 --> 00:10:32,927
Between her and Amber Lynn?

135
00:10:35,764 --> 00:10:37,698
What is the connection?

136
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:42,098
I don't know.

137
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:46,505
But we're going to find them.
I'm sure of it.

138
00:10:48,277 --> 00:10:50,973
I'm going to count backwards now, Fox.

139
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:53,412
And you'll fall into
a deep relaxed state...

140
00:10:53,482 --> 00:10:56,974
so that you'll remember all about
your sister and what happened.

141
00:10:58,587 --> 00:11:02,079
One hundred, ninety-nine,

142
00:11:02,157 --> 00:11:03,988
ninety-eight,

143
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:06,118
ninety-seven,

144
00:11:06,195 --> 00:11:08,129
ninety-six...

145
00:11:10,132 --> 00:11:12,191
Where are you now, Fox?

146
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:15,031
I'm at home...
my mom and dad's.

147
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:19,534
We're in the den
playing a game.

148
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:21,701
Who are you there with?

149
00:11:21,777 --> 00:11:23,802
Samantha.

150
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:26,245
- Do you feel in any danger?
- No.

151
00:11:26,315 --> 00:11:30,445
We're arguing, you know, but not really.
Just playing the game.
You know, fooling around.

152
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:35,183
By what I can tell from
the tape, he seems to be
in a legitimate hypnotic state.

153
00:11:35,257 --> 00:11:38,749
Pieces on the board
are fallin' off...

154
00:11:38,827 --> 00:11:41,159
Here I became suspicious.

155
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,290
-  Samantha?
- Suspicious of what?

156
00:11:46,502 --> 00:11:50,438
In 30 years with the F.B.I.,
you think you've seen it all.

157
00:11:52,107 --> 00:11:54,098
I sometimes think I have.

158
00:11:54,176 --> 00:11:59,204
But this is just a garden variety
compensatory abduction fantasy.

159
00:11:59,281 --> 00:12:01,272
Compensatory for what?

160
00:12:02,484 --> 00:12:05,476
His guilt. His fear.

161
00:12:05,554 --> 00:12:07,488
Everything that's preventing
Agent Mulder...

162
00:12:07,556 --> 00:12:10,184
from remembering the truth about
what really happened that night.

163
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:12,921
You mean his sister
wasn't abducted?

164
00:12:12,995 --> 00:12:17,227
No, his sister definitely went missing
in 1973. That's not in dispute.

165
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:23,067
Agent Mulder, however,
wasn't regressed until 1989.

166
00:12:23,138 --> 00:12:26,403
See, his delusion is playing
into his unconscious hope...

167
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:28,739
that his sister
is still alive.

168
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,779
And if you think about it,
his delusion has the effect...

169
00:12:31,847 --> 00:12:33,781
of giving him reason
to pursue her.

170
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:36,943
But why alien abduction?

171
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,579
Close Encounters, E. T.,
who knows?

172
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:43,523
But there was probably a lot of imagery
collecting in his head...

173
00:12:43,592 --> 00:12:45,526
in those 16 years.

174
00:12:45,594 --> 00:12:49,086
And then he comes down here,
and he finds the X-Files.

175
00:12:49,164 --> 00:12:51,724
So what do you think
happened to his sister?

176
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:55,402
Well, in 1973...

177
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:00,203
we were pretty damned unsophisticated
about violent predatory crime.

178
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:03,506
My guess is she was
kidnapped in the house,

179
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:05,843
her body was disposed of,
never found.

180
00:13:05,914 --> 00:13:07,905
You think that
his sister's dead?

181
00:13:07,983 --> 00:13:11,350
Have you seen this file?

182
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,187
There was an extraordinary amount
of effort put into finding his sister.

183
00:13:16,258 --> 00:13:18,920
Even the treasury department
got involved.

184
00:13:18,994 --> 00:13:21,656
His father worked at a high level
in the government.

185
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,426
They found nothing.

186
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:28,936
Why, Agent Scully? Why do you
wanna bring all this back up now?

187
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:32,306
Someone owes it to Mulder.

188
00:13:32,374 --> 00:13:35,309
Word of advice,
me to you.

189
00:13:35,377 --> 00:13:38,039
Let it be.

190
00:13:38,113 --> 00:13:42,106
You know, there are some wounds that are
just too painful ever to be reopened.

191
00:13:42,184 --> 00:13:44,948
Well, this particular wound
has never healed.

192
00:13:46,355 --> 00:13:49,119
And Mulder deserves closure,
just like anyone.

193
00:13:53,061 --> 00:13:55,291
Apes evolved from men?

194
00:13:55,364 --> 00:13:59,300
- There's gotta be an answer.
- Don't look for it, Taylor.

195
00:13:59,368 --> 00:14:02,531
You may not like
what you find.

196
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:13,172
Untie me!

197
00:14:24,226 --> 00:14:27,218
- What? What are you doing?
- I'm picking up something.

198
00:14:27,295 --> 00:14:30,389
- It's 3:00 in the morning.
- There's someone here.

199
00:14:30,465 --> 00:14:33,901
- Yeah, the TV is on...
- No. A visitor.

200
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:43,010
They... They wanna speak.
They wanna tell us something.

201
00:14:44,146 --> 00:14:46,114
What?

202
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:48,115
Get a piece of paper.

203
00:14:50,018 --> 00:14:53,351
- And a pen.

204
00:14:58,293 --> 00:15:00,227
No, you.

205
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:05,532
Shoot.

206
00:15:07,803 --> 00:15:09,737
It's your mother.

207
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:15,642
She's here in the room
with us.

208
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,941
She's trying to speak to you.

209
00:15:21,283 --> 00:15:23,217
What does she say?

210
00:15:26,722 --> 00:15:30,055
She wants to tell you
about your sister...

211
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,583
- Where she is.

212
00:15:33,662 --> 00:15:36,460
What is she saying?

213
00:15:36,531 --> 00:15:38,465
Harold?

214
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:40,467
I don't know. I...

215
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:45,264
-  She's gone.
- Come on, Harold.

216
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,740
I lost her.

217
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:49,970
- That's crap. You're full of crap.
- No.

218
00:15:50,045 --> 00:15:52,013
- Get out of here.
- I'm telling you...

219
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,380
- I'm telling you, I never
should have listened to you.
- She was here!

220
00:15:56,451 --> 00:15:58,942
- She had a message.
- Please go.

221
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,920
Look!

222
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:11,465
Who wrote that?

223
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:13,933
You did.

224
00:17:29,976 --> 00:17:32,240
- Mulder.
-  Mulder, it's me.

225
00:17:32,312 --> 00:17:36,578
I found something, and I'm standing here
not quite believing what it is.

226
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,210
- What is it?
- I don't know if you know this,

227
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:43,552
but there was a special treasury
department investigation
into Samantha's disappearance.

228
00:17:43,623 --> 00:17:45,921
In 1973.
I know all about that.

229
00:17:45,992 --> 00:17:50,429
Well, I'm in your mother's house
and I found a piece of a document
that she burned.

230
00:17:50,497 --> 00:17:55,935
A document that matches one that I found
in the treasury investigation file.

231
00:17:56,002 --> 00:17:58,095
But she had the original,
Mulder.

232
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:00,401
I don't see where
you're goin' with this, Scully.

233
00:18:00,474 --> 00:18:05,844
This is the document that
effectively calls off the search
for your sister, Mulder.

234
00:18:05,912 --> 00:18:09,905
And it's signed with
the initials "C.G.B.S."

235
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:12,884
C.G.B. Spender...

236
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:15,251
the Smoking Man.

237
00:18:15,322 --> 00:18:18,120
He was involved with this
back in '73.

238
00:18:18,191 --> 00:18:21,888
That's not exactly a revelation,
Scully. He was a friend of my father's.

239
00:18:21,962 --> 00:18:25,261
Mulder, you told me you believed that
he's the man that killed your father,

240
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:28,233
that he's the man who's
done nothing but confound your work,

241
00:18:28,301 --> 00:18:30,235
who's come close
to killing you.

242
00:18:30,303 --> 00:18:33,272
And here he's ordering people
to stop looking for your sister.

243
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,106
I don't see what you think
this proves, or how you think
it's gonna help me find her now.

244
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:39,668
- You don't wanna press him?
- It's a dead end.

245
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:42,943
He's never been of any help,
and he's not gonna be of any help now.

246
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:46,747
Look, I'm pursuing this my own way,
all right. I gotta go.

247
00:19:22,189 --> 00:19:24,714
It's not exactly the end
of the rainbow, is it, Harold?

248
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:28,522
There's something here.
I'm getting a strong sense of it.

249
00:19:28,595 --> 00:19:30,529
I think we should
have a look.

250
00:19:30,597 --> 00:19:33,225
I've had a look.

251
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,235
What are you afraid of?
That you'll really find her?

252
00:19:36,303 --> 00:19:38,863
- That you'd have to deal with it?
- There's nothing here.

253
00:19:38,939 --> 00:19:43,467
- It's a decommissioned base.
- You wrote the name down yourself.

254
00:19:43,543 --> 00:19:47,172
Why do you care so much about what I
feel? Why is this so important to you?

255
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,052
You gentlemen need
to move along.

256
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:03,425
I have to ask you to turn around
and get back in your car.

257
00:20:03,496 --> 00:20:05,657
There's nothing to see here.

258
00:20:08,935 --> 00:20:12,336
There is something here to see,
Agent Mulder. I'm sure of it.

259
00:20:22,748 --> 00:20:24,807
- Hello?

260
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:27,079
I should have grabbed it for you.

261
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,414
I like to make myself useful.

262
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:35,718
You can start by putting
out that cigarette.

263
00:20:35,795 --> 00:20:39,060
You've got it all figured out,
don't you, Agent Scully?

264
00:20:39,131 --> 00:20:43,033
All but why you can't
just come to the door and knock.

265
00:20:43,102 --> 00:20:45,036
I did that.

266
00:20:46,772 --> 00:20:48,706
No one answered.

267
00:20:54,614 --> 00:20:57,515
You're sick.

268
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,574
I had an operation.

269
00:20:59,652 --> 00:21:01,916
What do you want?

270
00:21:01,988 --> 00:21:04,320
I want you to stop looking.

271
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,484
You've wanted that
since 1973...

272
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,324
when you ordered an end to the search
for Agent Mulder's sister.

273
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:12,591
Your initials
are on that document.

274
00:21:12,665 --> 00:21:14,599
Yes, I signed that order,

275
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:18,262
because I knew then what I know now...
no one's gonna find her.

276
00:21:18,337 --> 00:21:21,636
- Why not?
- Because I believe she's dead.

277
00:21:21,707 --> 00:21:24,505
No reason to believe otherwise.

278
00:21:24,577 --> 00:21:26,511
You're a liar.

279
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:30,948
If you knew that she was dead,
why didn't you say something
earlier? Why now?

280
00:21:31,017 --> 00:21:34,509
There was so much to protect before.
It's all gone now.

281
00:21:34,587 --> 00:21:37,647
So you just let Mulder believe
that she was alive for all these years?

282
00:21:37,723 --> 00:21:40,089
Out of kindness,
Agent Scully.

283
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,128
Allow him his ignorance.

284
00:21:43,195 --> 00:21:45,686
It's what gives him hope.

285
00:22:40,219 --> 00:22:42,915
- My sister was here?
- Yes.

286
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:48,556
One of these houses?
Where?

287
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,125
I've lost it,
whatever it was.

288
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,362
Which house, Harold?
Come on. Which house?

289
00:22:57,436 --> 00:23:01,839
- I don't know.
- Harold, we don't have all night.
Which house was it?

290
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,764
Let's go, Harold.

291
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:37,875
You were right.
This was the house.

292
00:23:37,943 --> 00:23:39,968
- How do you know?
- Look.

293
00:23:42,048 --> 00:23:44,812
I told you!
What did I tell you?

294
00:23:44,884 --> 00:23:47,512
You told me
she was here.

295
00:23:47,586 --> 00:23:49,986
You didn't say with who.

296
00:24:02,433 --> 00:24:05,834
When did you come up
with this story, Mulder?

297
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:09,395
Because yesterday when
I spoke to you, you said
that the Smoking Man wasn't involved.

298
00:24:09,474 --> 00:24:13,570
Turns out you were right.
He had every reason
to call off the hunt for my sister.

299
00:24:13,644 --> 00:24:16,010
After her abduction,
she was returned to him...

300
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,538
and he raised her at the military base,
along with his son Jeffrey Spender.

301
00:24:19,617 --> 00:24:23,178
- Mulder...
- Scully, I saw her name in the cement.

302
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:26,519
Her handprints
right next to his.

303
00:24:27,992 --> 00:24:30,085
Mulder, I spoke to him...

304
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:32,857
the Smoking Man, C.G.B. Spender,
whatever his name is.

305
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,660
You went to him?

306
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:37,667
He told me
that she was dead.

307
00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:43,868
Well, he's a liar.

308
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:49,504
Mulder, why would he lie now?
I mean, think about it.

309
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,514
It hurts me
to tell you this.

310
00:24:51,582 --> 00:24:56,110
The handprints prove he's a liar!
I saw her handprints in the cement.

311
00:24:56,187 --> 00:25:00,556
Her name "Samantha" right underneath
them. How more obvious can it be?

312
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,116
Harold Piller led me there.
He led me right to 'em.

313
00:25:03,194 --> 00:25:05,719
Oh, he led you, Mulder.

314
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:08,129
He led you from the moment
that he met you.

315
00:25:12,336 --> 00:25:14,861
- Something wrong?

316
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:16,770
Sit down, Harold.

317
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:20,410
Hi.

318
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:22,878
You're back.

319
00:25:22,947 --> 00:25:27,577
Scully has informed me that
you failed to mention something
to me when we first met.

320
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:29,984
- What?
- That you're currently the subject...

321
00:25:30,054 --> 00:25:32,784
of a criminal investigation
into the murder of your son.

322
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:38,285
My son was taken from me.
The police need someone to blame.

323
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:41,957
That's not all, Harold.
Your history of mental illness.

324
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:46,402
- You were institutionalized,
diagnosed with schizophrenia.
- I've got that under control.

325
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:51,634
You wouldn't have believed me
if I had told you any of that.

326
00:25:51,709 --> 00:25:55,236
- Look what I've shown you.
- You only tell me what you see.

327
00:25:55,313 --> 00:25:57,975
I came to you
because I wanna help.

328
00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:01,917
You think I'm a fraud?
What do I have to gain from this?

329
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,320
How am I any different
from you?

330
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:08,552
All I want is to find my son.
I... I just...

331
00:26:09,827 --> 00:26:11,761
I just want my little boy back.

332
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:21,271
I see these things. I don't know how,
but... there has got to be a reason.

333
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:23,967
And if it's not to help,
what is it?

334
00:26:26,511 --> 00:26:29,776
I know your sister
is out there.

335
00:26:31,682 --> 00:26:33,980
Maybe I can prove it to you.

336
00:27:07,018 --> 00:27:10,181
Whoever's lived here
hasn't lived here in a long time.

337
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:16,792
- We're gonna need to hold hands.
- What do you mean?

338
00:27:16,861 --> 00:27:21,093
I'm going to try and summon
their presence into the house.

339
00:27:21,165 --> 00:27:26,262
Oh, yea. A seance. I haven't
done that since high school.

340
00:27:26,337 --> 00:27:28,931
Maybe afterwards we can play
"postman" and "spin the bottle."

341
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,040
I'm not going to say anything.

342
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:40,345
I'm just going to be very quiet and
still. That's how it seems to work best.

343
00:27:40,418 --> 00:27:43,046
Um, you might experience
a sudden chill...

344
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,715
or feel a pressure
in your ears.

345
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:49,123
That means they're here.

346
00:27:49,193 --> 00:27:51,627
And if they need to,
they'll let themselves be seen.

347
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:55,431
Close your eyes...

348
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:59,128
and let them
come to you.

349
00:27:59,203 --> 00:28:02,798
They will come to you
if you're ready to see.

350
00:28:02,873 --> 00:28:05,808
- How will we know?
- Shh.

351
00:28:05,876 --> 00:28:08,811
Stay quiet.
You'll know.

352
00:29:36,765 --> 00:29:38,699
Mulder?

353
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:43,397
- What are you doing?
- It's here.

354
00:29:43,471 --> 00:29:45,530
What is?

355
00:29:45,607 --> 00:29:48,701
There was a boy.
He led me into this room.

356
00:29:48,777 --> 00:29:50,836
Mulder?

357
00:30:07,395 --> 00:30:09,590
It's a diary.

358
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,195
It's your sister's.

359
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:24,770
"They did more tests today,
but not the horrible kind.

360
00:30:24,846 --> 00:30:28,077
"I was awake and they
made me lay still...

361
00:30:29,918 --> 00:30:32,580
"while they shine lights
in my eyes.

362
00:30:32,654 --> 00:30:35,555
"They asked me questions,
but I always lie now...

363
00:30:35,623 --> 00:30:38,786
"and tell them what they wanna hear
just to make 'em stop.

364
00:30:40,595 --> 00:30:43,962
"I hate them and I hate
the way they treat me,

365
00:30:44,032 --> 00:30:48,901
"like I'm an old suitcase
they can just drag around
and open up whenever they want to.

366
00:30:50,305 --> 00:30:54,036
They know I hate them,
but they... don't even care."

367
00:30:55,276 --> 00:30:57,210
This is 1979.

368
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:00,474
She's 14 years old here.

369
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:03,414
Fourteen years old.

370
00:31:09,357 --> 00:31:13,987
"Sometimes I think my memories
were taken by the doctors,
but not all of them.

371
00:31:14,062 --> 00:31:17,964
"I remember faces.
I think I had a brother...

372
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:21,628
"with brown hair
who used to tease me.

373
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:24,972
"I hope...

374
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:30,603
someday he reads this and knows
I wish I could see his face for real."

375
00:31:42,624 --> 00:31:44,854
And then, uh,

376
00:31:46,161 --> 00:31:49,619
she's, uh, talking
about running away.

377
00:31:53,034 --> 00:31:54,968
She wants to run away...

378
00:31:55,036 --> 00:31:59,473
so that they stop
doing the tests.

379
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:02,237
And then it just stops.

380
00:32:17,058 --> 00:32:19,492
Let's get out of here.

381
00:32:43,718 --> 00:32:47,085
You know, I never stop
to think...

382
00:32:47,155 --> 00:32:51,990
that the light is billions
of years old by the time we see it.

383
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,427
From the beginning
of time...

384
00:32:55,497 --> 00:32:57,965
right past us
into the future.

385
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:02,101
Nothing is ancient
in the universe.

386
00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:06,739
Maybe they are souls,
Scully...

387
00:33:08,877 --> 00:33:11,243
travel through time
and starlight...

388
00:33:12,747 --> 00:33:14,908
Iooking for homes.

389
00:33:16,818 --> 00:33:19,412
I wonder what
my mother saw.

390
00:33:21,189 --> 00:33:23,521
I wonder what she
was trying to tell me.

391
00:33:28,496 --> 00:33:30,555
Get some sleep.

392
00:33:33,668 --> 00:33:35,602
All right.

393
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:12,404
I got it, Mulder.
I couldn't believe it when I saw it.

394
00:34:12,473 --> 00:34:14,407
It was like it was
looking for me.

395
00:34:14,475 --> 00:34:18,275
- Sergeant's blotter, 1979.
- What are you talking about?

396
00:34:18,345 --> 00:34:21,314
The description matches your sister.

397
00:34:21,382 --> 00:34:25,250
- When did you find this?
- Mulder, it's almost noon.

398
00:34:31,525 --> 00:34:34,460
Maybe she went by another name.

399
00:34:34,528 --> 00:34:36,996
She could have given them
a name other than her own.

400
00:34:37,064 --> 00:34:39,760
She didn't give a name
at all.

401
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:43,291
Read this.
It's a medical report.

402
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:48,365
Admittance notes say the E.R. nurses
couldn't get her name out of her.

403
00:34:48,442 --> 00:34:50,535
Neither could the cops.

404
00:34:50,611 --> 00:34:52,841
Her medical examination
is normal.

405
00:34:52,913 --> 00:34:54,847
Her mental state...

406
00:34:54,915 --> 00:34:57,475
it says here she was exhibiting
signs of paranoia.

407
00:34:57,551 --> 00:35:00,918
Evidence of probable
self-inflicted abuse,

408
00:35:00,988 --> 00:35:05,789
including small crescent-shaped scars
on her knees, wrists and chest.

409
00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:07,793
Those are from
the tests, Scully.

410
00:35:07,861 --> 00:35:11,194
That's her.
She was here.

411
00:35:11,265 --> 00:35:13,460
Fourteen years old
in this hospital.

412
00:35:14,902 --> 00:35:18,633
"Diagnosis of condition incomplete.
Tests unavailable."

413
00:35:18,706 --> 00:35:21,140
And he knew.

414
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:25,474
He lied.
He knew she was alive.

415
00:35:25,546 --> 00:35:28,310
And the only reason he's lying now
is because she's still alive.

416
00:35:28,382 --> 00:35:30,509
Mulder, wait.

417
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:33,678
I know. You don't want me to get
my hopes up. I understand that.

418
00:35:33,754 --> 00:35:36,985
That was 1979.
It was 21 years ago.

419
00:35:37,057 --> 00:35:41,653
I don't know where to begin,
and we don't have a record here
of a doctor signing her out.

420
00:35:41,729 --> 00:35:44,323
We have an E.R. nurse
who signed her in.

421
00:36:15,095 --> 00:36:17,029
What's wrong?

422
00:36:18,866 --> 00:36:22,131
I have this powerful feeling,
and I can't explain it,

423
00:36:22,202 --> 00:36:26,229
but that... this is
the end of the road.

424
00:36:27,908 --> 00:36:30,570
That I've been brought here
to learn the truth.

425
00:36:30,644 --> 00:36:33,374
Are you ready for it?

426
00:36:37,985 --> 00:36:40,545
Do you want me
to go talk to her myself?

427
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,224
Okay.

428
00:37:09,616 --> 00:37:11,948
Oh. I thought that was the door.

429
00:37:12,019 --> 00:37:15,147
- Arbutus Ray?
- Yes.

430
00:37:15,222 --> 00:37:17,656
Are you the same Arbutus Ray
that worked as a nurse...

431
00:37:17,724 --> 00:37:20,784
at the Dominic Savio
Memorial Hospital in 1979?

432
00:37:20,861 --> 00:37:23,295
Yes, I'm she.

433
00:37:24,565 --> 00:37:27,693
I'd like to ask you about
a patient you treated...

434
00:37:27,768 --> 00:37:29,929
a 14-year-old girl.

435
00:37:31,805 --> 00:37:35,036
I remember. Yes.

436
00:37:35,108 --> 00:37:37,372
She was such
a pretty young girl.

437
00:37:37,444 --> 00:37:41,574
You couldn't forget someone like her,
or how frightened she was.

438
00:37:41,648 --> 00:37:44,674
Scared for her sweet life.

439
00:37:44,751 --> 00:37:48,380
The deputy brought her in.
She was shaking like a leaf.

440
00:37:48,455 --> 00:37:51,856
Wouldn't let anyone
touch her but me.

441
00:37:51,925 --> 00:37:55,292
Then the strangest thing happened.

442
00:37:55,362 --> 00:37:58,297
You had a vision
of her... dead.

443
00:37:58,365 --> 00:38:01,232
Like the parents
of Amber Lynn LaPierre.

444
00:38:01,301 --> 00:38:03,326
No one believed me.

445
00:38:05,072 --> 00:38:08,166
Honestly, you're
the first person who...

446
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:10,870
- So you saw her dead?
- That night in her bed.

447
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:13,845
I blinked and it was gone.

448
00:38:13,914 --> 00:38:16,075
She was sleeping
as sound as could be.

449
00:38:17,451 --> 00:38:19,385
I don't know why, but...

450
00:38:19,453 --> 00:38:23,412
it made some kind
of strange sense.

451
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,651
What do you mean?

452
00:38:25,726 --> 00:38:27,751
There were men.

453
00:38:27,828 --> 00:38:30,558
They came to pick her up
late that night.

454
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:33,930
I assumed the one
was her father, but he...

455
00:38:34,001 --> 00:38:36,993
he gave me such a chill
when he looked at me...

456
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:40,233
when I asked him would he please
put out his cigarette.

457
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:45,411
So, they took her?

458
00:38:45,544 --> 00:38:47,068
They meant to.

459
00:38:47,146 --> 00:38:49,842
But when I took them
to her room,

460
00:38:49,915 --> 00:38:51,849
she was gone.

461
00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:55,683
Disappeared out of a locked room.

462
00:38:55,754 --> 00:38:57,915
Just vanished.

463
00:40:50,469 --> 00:40:52,403
Samantha.

464
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:49,383
Mulder, where'd you go?

465
00:41:52,798 --> 00:41:54,732
End of the road.

466
00:42:00,339 --> 00:42:02,307
He's okay.
It's okay.

467
00:42:02,374 --> 00:42:04,467
My son?
You saw my son?

468
00:42:04,543 --> 00:42:08,411
He's dead.
They're all dead, Harold...

469
00:42:10,482 --> 00:42:13,110
your son, Amber Lynn,
my sister.

470
00:42:13,185 --> 00:42:15,380
- No.
- Harold.

471
00:42:15,454 --> 00:42:19,117
You see so much,
but you refuse to see him.

472
00:42:20,192 --> 00:42:22,922
You refuse to let him go.

473
00:42:22,995 --> 00:42:25,463
But you have to let him
go now, Harold.

474
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:28,499
He's protected. He's in a better place.
They're all in a better place.

475
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:30,797
We both have to let go, Harold.

476
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:33,804
You're wrong.
I'm going to find him.

477
00:42:33,872 --> 00:42:36,966
I don't believe you!

478
00:42:49,388 --> 00:42:51,322
Mulder, what happened?

479
00:42:53,091 --> 00:42:55,685
Are you sure
you're all right?

480
00:42:59,064 --> 00:43:00,998
I'm fine.

481
00:43:03,268 --> 00:43:05,202
I'm free.
