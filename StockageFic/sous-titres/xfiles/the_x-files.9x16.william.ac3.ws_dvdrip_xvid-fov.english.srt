I'm sure of it.

60
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:07,492

- It all started when I tracked down...

61
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,624
a mileage discrepancy
in the Bureau's vehicle fleet.

62
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:12,497
It turns out a really
nice secretary...

63
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,161
from our Baltimore
field office...

64
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:16,705
had used a Ford Taurus
without authorization.

65
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:20,376
And what does that have
to do with...

66
00:05:20,477 --> 00:05:23,002
Well, she was desperate
to visit her grandson...

67
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:24,978
which is why she
borrowed the car.

68
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:27,482
She's the one who
told me about this case.

69
00:05:27,584 --> 00:05:28,812
This was her daughter.

70
00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:34,215
And what makes you think
this is an X-File?

71
00:05:34,324 --> 00:05:35,985
Well, this dead woman's son...

72
00:05:36,093 --> 00:05:37,390
my friend's grandson...

73
00:05:37,494 --> 00:05:38,722
This is Tommy Conlon.

74
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:40,319
Tommy is eight years old.

75
00:05:40,431 --> 00:05:42,524
And Tommy told her...

76
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,727
a monster killed his mother.

77
00:05:45,836 --> 00:05:48,304
And his father knows
all about it.

79
00:05:52,543 --> 00:05:54,408

of an eight-year-old?

80
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:55,535
But...

82
00:06:01,118 --> 00:06:04,053
Clearly this woman
was murdered, and yet...

83
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:06,145
And yet the coroner concludes...

84
00:06:06,256 --> 00:06:08,588
that she stabbed herself to death.

85
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:11,792

86
00:06:11,895 --> 00:06:14,864

But...

88
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:20,460
I mean, how could someone
stab themselves 16 times?

89
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:22,004
Look, it is unusual...

90
00:06:22,106 --> 00:06:24,097
but I have seen it before.

91
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,005
Tommy's father took the boy...

92
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,408
to some mountaintop
in Pennsylvania...

93
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:30,139

94
00:06:30,247 --> 00:06:32,238

95
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:33,748

98
00:06:37,054 --> 00:06:38,954
isn't allowed
to see him anymore.

but unless you have
other evidence...

101
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:45,922
Wait, wait.

102
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:49,590
Tommy said that the same monster
that killed his mother...

103
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,292
killed Spanky, his pet cat.

104
00:06:56,406 --> 00:07:00,103
Uh, unless you bring me Spanky,

A teenager who was struck
by lightning...

273

we're dealing with here, Leyla.

Agents Mulder and Scully do...

if they were in this situation?

280
00:16:22,172 --> 00:16:25,300
Agents Mulder and Scully
aren't in this situation.

281
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:27,035

but Agent Doggett's
going to sit his tired ass down.

284
00:16:33,116 --> 00:16:35,175
What kind of a course
of action is that?

285
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,185
I think Agent Doggett
is saying that...

286
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,222

they did to me.

324
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,385

one time before.

every one of you...

Just... now.

366
00:21:34,384 --> 00:21:35,851
Thank you.

367
00:21:37,787 --> 00:21:38,947
Agent Scully.

368
00:21:39,055 --> 00:21:40,613
Yeah, ma'am,
this is SheriffJack Coogan.

369
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:42,213
I got a message to call this number.

370
00:21:42,325 --> 00:21:43,553
Hi, Sheriff.

371
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,560
Thanks for getting back to me.
I appreciate it.

372
00:21:45,695 --> 00:21:47,026
I'm an F.B.I. Agent...

373
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,860
and I've been trying to reach
three of my colleagues...

374
00:21:49,966 --> 00:21:51,433
that are up in your area.

375
00:21:51,534 --> 00:21:53,161
Were they on some kind of case?

376
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:55,362
Well, they're looking
into some concerns...

377
00:21:55,471 --> 00:21:57,564
expressed by the grandmother
of a child.

378
00:21:57,674 --> 00:22:00,438
The family name is Conlon,
and I have an address...

379
00:22:00,543 --> 00:22:02,909
No need.

380
00:22:03,012 --> 00:22:05,537
I was back up there
a couple of weeks ago.

381
00:22:05,648 --> 00:22:09,175
Got into a kind of a shouting
match with the father.

382
00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:10,479
Over what?

383
00:22:10,586 --> 00:22:13,680
The grandmother asked me
to look in on the boy.

384
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:17,453
Father told me to get
the hell off his property.

385
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,551
Boy seemed fine, so I did.

386
00:22:19,662 --> 00:22:23,257
Well, as I say, Sheriff,
I need to contact my colleagues.

387
00:22:23,366 --> 00:22:25,300
I'm happy to take a drive up there...

388
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:27,266
but can't promise much tonight.

389
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,204
The roads are icing up as we speak.

390
00:22:31,307 --> 00:22:32,934
Won't be easy getting in.

391
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:36,239
Look, Sheriff,
they may be in danger.

392
00:22:36,345 --> 00:22:39,212
Could you please find a way?

Dead or alive.

398
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,407
You want to explain this,
Mr. Conlon?

399
00:23:10,513 --> 00:23:12,572
It's just a mirror
from my son's room.

400
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,649
Why'd you bury it?

401
00:23:15,752 --> 00:23:17,982
'Cause he was afraid of it.

402
00:23:21,457 --> 00:23:24,358
I want you to get Tommy
bundled up in warm clothes.

403
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,951
I want you to pack anything
you think he might need.

404
00:23:27,063 --> 00:23:28,257
Why?

405
00:23:28,364 --> 00:23:30,889
'Cause I don't believe
one damn thing you've told me...

406
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,297
except that we're in danger...

407
00:23:32,401 --> 00:23:35,131

out of here, all five of us.

Black magic.

410
00:23:45,148 --> 00:23:48,777
Mirrors are powerful symbols
in conjuring in the dark arts.

411
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,147
That's what this is.

412
00:23:50,253 --> 00:23:51,379

Uh-huh.

414
00:23:59,061 --> 00:24:01,222

maybe six miles...

00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,661
down the mountain.

416
00:24:02,765 --> 00:24:04,995
It'll be a hike,
but we can make it.

417
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:06,693
Dad, the sheriff...

418
00:24:06,803 --> 00:24:08,100
No. Tommy...

Don't worry about the sheriff.

420

429
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,782
Perfect timing.

430
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:00,048
We were just leaving, Sheriff.

431
00:25:00,156 --> 00:25:01,282

You can't go anywhere.

00:25:09,332 --> 00:25:10,890

his answering machine.

Hey, you're really worried.

452
00:26:23,105 --> 00:26:25,130
I thought
you didn't find anything.

453
00:26:25,241 --> 00:26:27,709
You told me there wasn't
anything inside that cat.

454
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,141
No, there wasn't.

455
00:26:29,245 --> 00:26:31,270
But it certainly seems
like there should have been.

456
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,109
What does that mean?

457
00:26:33,215 --> 00:26:35,547
Well, the pattern of bite marks.

458
00:26:35,651 --> 00:26:38,415
I mean, it seems to me
that the cat was trying...

459
00:26:38,521 --> 00:26:41,149
to get at something
in its stomach...

460
00:26:41,257 --> 00:26:43,919
to chew something out.

461
00:26:44,026 --> 00:26:46,494
Something. What?

462
00:26:46,595 --> 00:26:47,687
I don't know.

463
00:26:47,797 --> 00:26:49,765
I mean, there wasn't any sign of it...

464
00:26:49,865 --> 00:26:52,834
but it obviously caused
a great deal of pain.

465
00:26:52,935 --> 00:26:55,165
And I'm thinking maybe
it goes the same...

466
00:26:55,271 --> 00:26:57,501
for the woman who tried
to stab herself.

467
00:26:57,606 --> 00:27:01,736
I mean, what if that
was a frantic attempt...

468
00:27:01,844 --> 00:27:03,709
to... to cut something out.

469
00:27:03,813 --> 00:27:04,802
Wait a minute.

our time talking about this.

00:27:12,955 --> 00:27:15,287
My mom.

474
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:18,121
I'm going to beg her to baby-sit.

475
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:25,191
Got anything?

476
00:27:25,301 --> 00:27:26,199
Yeah.

477
00:27:26,302 --> 00:27:29,066
A salad spoon no one's
ever going to use again.

478
00:27:29,171 --> 00:27:30,798
And the sheriff here?

479
00:27:30,906 --> 00:27:32,999
Do not ask me
to explain it...

480
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:36,545
but he's got absolutely
no internal organs.

481
00:27:36,645 --> 00:27:40,012
He's like,
he's like a big bag.

482
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,913
You know what else?

483
00:27:42,018 --> 00:27:43,144
This isn't blood.

484
00:27:43,252 --> 00:27:45,812
Whatever it is,
I bet it's the same crap...

485
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:48,048
that's all over
the inside of our car.

486
00:27:53,229 --> 00:27:54,958
I've been thinking.

487
00:27:56,899 --> 00:28:00,426
You know, I hate to sound
like Agent Harrison...

488
00:28:00,536 --> 00:28:03,528
but Mulder and Scully
had a case like this...

489
00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:05,539
that I remember
where they were trapped...

490
00:28:05,641 --> 00:28:07,472
underground with these
mushroom spores...

491
00:28:07,576 --> 00:28:10,067
that caused hallucinations.

492
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:11,806
Never mind.

493
00:28:11,914 --> 00:28:14,405
I don't know what to say, either.

494
00:28:14,517 --> 00:28:17,850
Maybe Mulder and Scully
would see something...

495
00:28:17,953 --> 00:28:18,977
that we don't.

496
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:21,147
How?

497
00:28:21,257 --> 00:28:24,988
Nothing here makes any sense.

498
00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:27,722
Unless that's the very thing
that we need to see.

499
00:28:49,485 --> 00:28:51,248
Agent Harrison, you want
to take Tommy up to his room?

500
00:28:51,353 --> 00:28:53,583
Sure.

501
00:28:53,689 --> 00:28:54,621
Come on, Tommy.

502
00:29:02,932 --> 00:29:04,524
What's the matter?

503
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:06,157
You like Leyla, don't you?

504
00:29:06,268 --> 00:29:08,600
Can you stay with me instead?

505
00:29:14,777 --> 00:29:15,937
Sure.

506
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,376
Come on.

507
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:30,725
I'm just a cop, Mr. Conlon.

508
00:29:30,826 --> 00:29:33,260
Maybe I don't have
the imagination to connect...

509
00:29:33,362 --> 00:29:35,523
all the pieces
of this insanity together.

510
00:29:35,631 --> 00:29:37,895
You said that wasn't
exactly the sheriff in there...

511
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,524
and I want to know
what you meant.

512
00:29:39,635 --> 00:29:42,331
In fact, you tried
to warn us...

513
00:29:42,438 --> 00:29:44,030
that bag of goo
wasn't the sheriff.

514
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,334
You were trying to help us.

515
00:29:45,441 --> 00:29:49,434
Yeah, so why not help us now?

516
00:29:49,545 --> 00:29:51,809
Tell us what you know,
Mr. Conlon...

517
00:29:51,914 --> 00:29:53,313
for Tommy's sake.

518
00:29:53,415 --> 00:29:55,406
[Doggett]
Your son, Tommy...

519
00:29:55,518 --> 00:29:57,179
you move him up here
in the middle of nowhere...

520
00:29:57,286 --> 00:29:59,083
and you lock him
in the room with those things.

521
00:29:59,188 --> 00:30:01,622
Now, if you're just
trying to get rid of him...

522
00:30:01,724 --> 00:30:02,816
is that all this is?

523
00:30:02,925 --> 00:30:04,017
I love my son.

524
00:30:04,126 --> 00:30:06,390
I love my son, you bastard.

525
00:30:06,495 --> 00:30:07,962
Well, you locked him
in the room with those things.

526
00:30:08,063 --> 00:30:11,521
Because I knew
they wouldn't hurt him.

527
00:30:13,035 --> 00:30:14,366
Now, why is that?

528
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,869
They hurt you...

529
00:30:15,971 --> 00:30:18,030
they certainly hurt your wife.

530
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,005
Why didn't they hurt Tommy?

531
00:30:31,387 --> 00:30:32,854
I made this.

532
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,049
You drew all these?

533
00:30:56,879 --> 00:30:58,039
This one's you.

534
00:31:04,687 --> 00:31:07,178
Why would you draw this, Tommy?

535
00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:12,420
Why would you imagine
such awful things?

536
00:31:12,528 --> 00:31:13,961
Because I'm afraid.

537
00:31:29,712 --> 00:31:31,236

00:31:39,688 --> 00:31:41,747
Yeah.

541
00:31:41,857 --> 00:31:43,415
I, uh, I still can't contact
my partners.

542
00:31:43,525 --> 00:31:44,685
Were you able to get up there?

543
00:31:44,793 --> 00:31:46,283
I just got back from trying.

544
00:31:46,395 --> 00:31:49,762
