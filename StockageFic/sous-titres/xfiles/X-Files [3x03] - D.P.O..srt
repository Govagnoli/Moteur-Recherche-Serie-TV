a call on the radio.

- They said he was struck by lightning.

Yeah, that happens.

my game, man, I'm there, you know ?

186
00:13:35,962 --> 00:13:38,658
It's like a--
a nuclear explosion could go off,

wouldn't even notice.

- Yeah.
- Do you consider yourself
a lucky person ?

- Me ? I don't think so.
- Yeah.

What happened here,

- Three dead cows.
How do you think they died ?
- Lightning.

242
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:34,464
That's right. I just got off
with Dean Greiner at the observatory,

243
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:36,467
which, by the way, is just about
a mile through those trees.

244

Did they report
lightning last night ?

245
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:40,664
They can detect every flash
of lightning on this planet.

Did you know that ?
See, each one emits radio waves
at the exact same frequency--

You can pick it up on any
transistor radio. See that, Sheriff ?

250
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:55,315
Not much question that lightning
killed these cows last night,

251
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:58,185
just like it killed Jack Hammond
the night before last.

the way it looks.

You know what this is ? Huh ?

255
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:11,069
It looks like a fulgarite.

256
00:18:11,137 --> 00:18:13,264
That only happens
with lightning--

257
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:16,172

from the heat of a discharge.

do you need ?

267
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,205
Well, considering
it's a partial imprint,

268
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:55,509
there's a lot
of information here.

269
00:18:55,581 --> 00:18:58,015
That's great. Now can you make me
a little cherub that squirts water ?

270
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:02,554

eight and a half.

272

right here on the bottom.

But I may have something
even better.

275
00:19:13,098 --> 00:19:15,089
When I was cleaning the imprint
to take the mold,

276
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:18,898
I found trace amounts
of a viscous substance
actually embedded in the fulgarite.

277
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:20,632
What is it ?

278
00:19:20,706 --> 00:19:23,800
Well, I’d have to conduct
a chemical analysis to be sure,

279
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:26,401

00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:09,530
There's a yearbook
in Darin's closet.

333
00:23:25,217 --> 00:23:27,708
- [ Scully] Her name is Sharon Kiveat.
- Kiveat.

334

is called Kiveat Auto Body.

He's pretty bad off.

338

- Yeah.

He just collapsed.
- What happened ?

345

You were in my husband's

366

- I'm sorry, I can't.
- I'd like to ask you
about Darin Oswald.

367
00:26:23,262 --> 00:26:26,322
He was at the scene of
the accident, wasn't he ?

368
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:28,832
Please, I need
to see my husband.

369
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:42,108
I just talked to one of the
E.M.S. workers. He was pretty rattled.

370
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,740
- Why ?
- Frank Kiveat's electrocardiogram.

371
00:26:44,816 --> 00:26:48,377
Take a look at this. See that
spike there ? That indicates...

372
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:50,455
that some kind of electrical
intervention started his heart.

373
00:26:50,522 --> 00:26:53,958
Except according to the E.M.S. worker,
the defibrillator wouldn’t charge.

374
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:56,721
- The paddles were dead.
- How did he explain this ?

375
00:26:56,795 --> 00:27:00,788
He didn't. All he saw was
Darin Oswald touching Kiveat's chest.

376
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:03,935
I've been going over
Oswald's chart.

377
00:27:04,002 --> 00:27:06,300
There's something I want you
to take a look at.

378
00:27:09,675 --> 00:27:12,439
He was admitted to the E.R.
five months ago in cardiac arrest.

379
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:15,309
Respiratory failure. Class three burns
on his back and his scalp.

380
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,872
Resuscitated
after 21 minutes.

381
00:27:18,984 --> 00:27:22,784
Hang on, this is odd. His blood test
showed acute hypokalemia.

382
00:27:22,854 --> 00:27:25,652
- Yeah. What is that ?
- It's a severe chemical imbalance...

383
00:27:25,724 --> 00:27:28,158
characterized by high sodium
and low potassium levels.

384
00:27:28,226 --> 00:27:30,660
- Electrolytes, right ?
- Yeah.

385
00:27:30,729 --> 00:27:32,663
And what do electrolytes do ?

386
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:35,632
Among other things, they generate
the electrical impulses in our body.

387
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:38,261
It's like every time our
heart beats or a neuron fires--

388
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:41,067
Okay, it's a leap, Scully, but what if
Oswald's electrolyte imbalance...

389
00:27:41,139 --> 00:27:44,336
is somehow enabling him to
generate electricity at levels
much higher than normal ?

390
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:46,673
Our body
doesn't work like that.

391
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:49,805
Unless his body is abnormally
conductive. Because if
that heel print is Oswald's,

392
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:52,975
that means he conducted millions of
volts of electricity into the ground...

393
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:56,612
- and just walked away.
- So you’re saying that he's
some kind of a lightning rod ?

394
00:27:56,722 --> 00:27:58,747
No, I'm saying that
he is lightning,

395
00:27:58,857 --> 00:28:00,984
and we've got to get to him
before he strikes again.

all those people died.

403
00:28:49,074 --> 00:28:52,066

Why did you run when you saw us ?

404
00:28:52,144 --> 00:28:55,739
I was taking a walk. Now,
that's not against the law, is it ?

405
00:28:56,948 --> 00:28:59,007
Anyway, you guys should be
giving me a medal.

406
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:03,554
- I mean, I saved my boss's life.
- We're not so sure.

407
00:29:03,655 --> 00:29:06,590
Why ? Who told you that ?
Who you been talking to ?

408

You been talking to Zero ?
He the one who told you that ?

409
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,697
What'd he say ?

410
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:23,707
Not much,
except that he's a hero.

411
00:29:23,775 --> 00:29:26,767
- How did he say he revived Kiveat ?
- C.P.R.

412
00:29:28,313 --> 00:29:30,247
He claims he paid attention
in health class.

413
00:29:30,315 --> 00:29:32,249
I don't think he just
resuscitated Frank Kiveat.

414
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,284
I think he set
the whole thing up.

415
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:37,287
- How ? By causing
Kiveat's heart attack ?
- See what he did to my phone ?

416
00:29:37,355 --> 00:29:40,256
So what ? Are we supposed to charge him
with assaulting a cellular phone ?

417
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:42,919
I think we should run a full set
of lab tests on this guy.

418
00:29:42,994 --> 00:29:47,090
Look where we are.
We don't have the capability
or the time to perform those tests.

419
00:29:47,165 --> 00:29:50,896
And without a confession, we can only
keep him in custody for 72 hours.

420
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:54,405

who might be able to help us.

this afternoon,

425

charges without your help.

How would you describe
your relationship with him ?

430
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:35,278
Well, I'm not blind.
I knew he had a crush on me,

431
00:30:35,347 --> 00:30:37,372
but I felt sorry for him.

432
00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:40,782

433
00:30:40,886 --> 00:30:44,481
It just seemed he had more than
his share of bad luck.

434
00:30:44,589 --> 00:30:46,819
Did you get him the job
at your husband's garage ?

435
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,021
Yeah. Then about six months ago,
I started getting these phone calls.

436
00:30:53,098 --> 00:30:55,862
Someone would call
and then hang up.

437
00:30:55,934 --> 00:30:57,868
How did you know
it was Darin ?

438
00:30:57,936 --> 00:31:00,370
The way he looked at me
in the garage.

439
00:31:03,175 --> 00:31:05,109
The phone calls made me feel
the same way.

440

I just knew.

441
00:31:07,412 --> 00:31:10,870
When did you first suspect
that Darin was involved
in something more than prank calls ?

442
00:31:12,817 --> 00:31:15,786
- He told me.
- He actually confessed
to killing those people ?

443
00:31:15,887 --> 00:31:20,187
No, but he, uh,
he told me that he had powers.

444
00:31:21,393 --> 00:31:23,918
- Dangerous powers.
- When was this ?

- Did you tell anyone ?

Who would've believed me ?

450
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,642
And I was afraid.

451
00:31:44,749 --> 00:31:48,776

what he might do tome...

452
00:31:48,887 --> 00:31:50,821
and what he would...

- After I read your arrest report.

- I believe Darin Oswald...

461
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:35,231
was involved somehow in the deaths
of those four people,

462
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,768

for you to let him go.

- In effect ?

There's no scientific basis
for that claim.

00:35:24,536 --> 00:35:26,697
The doctor said that my husband
cannot leave this room.

494
00:35:26,771 --> 00:35:29,740
- I'm not gonna leave him here.
- [Mulder]I'll stay with him.

495
00:35:29,808 --> 00:35:32,072
- You go with Agent Scully.
- No.

496
00:35:32,143 --> 00:35:34,543
Sharon, please.

497
00:35:36,514 --> 00:35:38,448
He's here.

[Elevator Bell Dinging]

499
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:06,710
He's dead.

500
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:11,540
How many other access points
to this floor ?

501
00:36:11,649 --> 00:36:13,617
Other than the elevator,
just the stairway.

502
00:36:13,685 --> 00:36:16,779
-Stay with them. I'm going after Oswald.
-Mulder.

503
00:36:58,863 --> 00:37:01,297
- Mrs. Kiveat ?
- [Scully]Darin.

504
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:03,391
- Don't move.
- Where is she ?

505
00:37:03,468 --> 00:37:05,663
I said, don't move.

506
00:37:08,573 --> 00:37:10,734
Darin.

507
00:37:13,778 --> 00:37:18,078
- Mrs. Kiveat.
- Stop ! I'm warning you.

508
00:37:19,484 --> 00:37:21,452
All right, come with me,
please, Mrs. Kiveat.

509
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:26,582
'Cause there’s some things--
stuff that I need to tell you.

510
00:37:26,658 --> 00:37:28,717
I want you to step back
inside that room.

511
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:31,387
Are you coming with me,
Mrs. Kiveat?

512
00:37:31,462 --> 00:37:33,862
- She's not going anywhere
with you, Darin.
- I can hurt you !

513
00:37:33,932 --> 00:37:37,197
I can hurt you too. I'm gonna
give you three seconds. One--

514

- Now, I'm done fooling around now !
- Stop it !

515
00:37:44,075 --> 00:37:47,533
I'll go with you.
Okay ?

516
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:53,413
If that’s what you want,
I'll go. Just... stop it.

517
00:37:55,286 --> 00:37:58,153
Sharon, we can work this
all out right here.

518
00:37:58,222 --> 00:38:00,952
No, we can't.

519
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:02,890
All right.

520
00:38:06,364 --> 00:38:08,298
All right then.

521
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:26,309
You were the only person
that was ever nice to me.

522
00:38:26,417 --> 00:38:28,351
You know that ?

523
00:38:30,622 --> 00:38:32,715
I mean--

524
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,781
Hey, you remember
that first day in class...

525
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:38,124
when you wore that green dress
with the yellow flowers on it ?

526
00:38:38,196 --> 00:38:41,359
How when you stood in front
of the window,

527
00:38:41,432 --> 00:38:44,924
-you could almost see through it ?

- I don't know.

00:38:51,576 --> 00:38:54,568
Anywhere you wanna go.

531
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:58,342
I got money from
a cash machine, you know ?

532
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:02,385
Plus, you know,
we can take any car you want.

533
00:39:02,453 --> 00:39:04,683
You know,
you just take your pick.

534
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:09,523
We can take an Accord
or a Maxima, you know.

535
00:39:09,594 --> 00:39:11,789
Do you like any of those ?

536
00:39:11,863 --> 00:39:15,856

go Japanese, you know,

537
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:18,527
- how about a Taurus ?
- [ Engine Starts ]

538
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:25,769
No, you're right, you know.
All these cars suck.

539
00:39:25,877 --> 00:39:29,313
We'll just boost one of them
for right now and then...

540
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:32,549
- we'll trade it later.

541

just take it easy,
Mrs. Kiveat, all right ?

542
00:39:45,129 --> 00:39:46,960
No--

543
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:53,060
- Mrs. Kiveat ?
- Hey ! Come over here.
Come on over here !

544
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:15,392
Mrs. Kiveat ?

545
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:18,756
Mrs. Kiveat, where are you ?

546
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:28,269
Oh, come on, now!
I said I'd take care of you.

547
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:31,365
What else did you want ?

548
00:40:31,442 --> 00:40:34,502
I'd have given you anything !

549
00:40:34,612 --> 00:40:37,103
Anything you wanted!

550
00:40:37,215 --> 00:40:42,414
- Mrs. Kiveat !
- Okay, son, turn around. Let's go.

551
00:40:42,487 --> 00:40:45,923
Look, I don't know what kind of trouble
you're up to, but I want some answers.

552
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:48,788
No !
I want some answers !

553
00:40:50,495 --> 00:40:52,963
Where is she ?

554
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,897

You're pissing me off !

557
00:41:03,274 --> 00:41:07,005
Tell me where she is !

558
00:41:58,863 --> 00:42:02,060
[Scully]I just got off
the phone with the coroner.

559
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:05,067
He's ruling
Teller's death accidental.

560
00:42:05,136 --> 00:42:07,434
Lightning ?

561
00:42:07,505 --> 00:42:10,269
What about the scientists at the
observatory ? What do they have to say ?

562
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:13,333
They also reported
lightning last night.

563
00:42:13,411 --> 00:42:16,744
I talked to the D.A. He has no idea
how to begin building a case.

564
00:42:16,814 --> 00:42:18,748
What about the tests
I asked for ?

565
00:42:18,816 --> 00:42:20,750
- The results came in five minutes ago.
- And ?

566
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:25,079
Nothing unusual
was detected, Mulder.

567
00:42:25,156 --> 00:42:28,956
The electrolytes, the blood gas levels,
brain wave activity.

568
00:42:29,026 --> 00:42:32,154

the data that's been gathered--
