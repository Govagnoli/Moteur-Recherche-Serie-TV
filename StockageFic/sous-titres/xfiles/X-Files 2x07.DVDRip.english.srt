Damn.

3
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,154
There's ash in the wine
from the fires in Malibu Canyon.

4
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,069
You can almost see from here.

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,673
I want you to know I... I don't do this.

I... I mean I'm... I'm not one of those guys...

8
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,398
...that sends his family
on vacation just so he can...

9
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,756
But... when I met you
at the corporate party, I...

10
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,831
Ssshh.

11
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,471
It'll be worth it.

12
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,795
I'll do things with you no one's ever done.

13
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,508

<i>(phone)</i>

18
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,312
Let's start in the bedroom
and work our way downstairs.

19
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,995
Don't let the media in on the writings
in blood on the wall.

20
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,756
Excuse me, sir. If I can ask your indulgence,
this is a restricted crime scene.

21
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,400
- Mulder. I'm with the Bureau.
- Nobody called them.

22
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,515
They should have.

23
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,434
LAPD has seen, I don't know, a couple
of weird crime scenes down the years.

24
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,512
- We can handle it.
- There's no time for agency rivalries.

25
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,956
I don't care about credit for the arrest
or what goes on whose record.

26
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,113
In the past year these killers have murdered
six people. They only kill at night.

27
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,237
In a week, two more people
will be dead and they will be gone.

28
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,392
- How do you know?
- There's a file on the previous murders.

29
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,439
I've studied it. I've studied <i>them.</i>
I've been waiting for them to reappear.

30
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,239
How can you be sure
these are the same killers?

31
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,709
The wire reported a body drained of blood...

32
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,076
...bite marks on the exteriorjugular
and median cubital veins.

33
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,355
Every mirror in the house was smashed.

34
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,353
Yeah, well, it's what the wire <i>didn't</i> report
that distinguishes this scene.

35
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,194
There's writings on the wall,
written in the victim's blood.

36
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,831
"He who eats of my flesh and drinks
of my blood shall have eternal life."

37
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,912
"And I will raise him up on the last day."

38
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,835
They have the same feeble literal grasp of the
Bible as all those big-haired preachers do.

39
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,436
The victim - was he a father?

40
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,274
Yeah. Three boys.
The, uh, family's been notified.

41
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,629
In Memphis they murdered James Ellis,
58, father of Ellis & Sons Clothiers.

42
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,190
The second victim was
a Korean woman, Linda Sun.

43
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,238
The third victim was a Jesuit theologian.

44
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,594
Excuse me.

45
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,468
In Portland, three months ago,
the first victim was a priest.

46
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,389
The second victim was the only son
in a family of six children.

47
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,156
The last victim was the owner of
a New Age book shop - The Holy Spirit.

48
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,439
I believe that's how they perceive
themselves, as a kind of unholy trinity.

49
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,037
They use these to extract the blood
and then store it for a quick fix later.

50
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,151
Their need is insatiable, but murdering
for blood risks exposure and capture.

51
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,073
If my profile of
the previous cases holds true...

52
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,277
...they've been working near
blood products for a month.

53
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,433
Look, Agent Mulder, I'm really sorry
I was such a hard-ass back there.

54
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,557
But in this town
it's really tough to trust anyone.

55
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,837
I'd be happy to have you work
on our investigation. This is...

56
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,639
I'm working alone.

57
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,188
An FBI agent without a partner?

58
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,756
Our department's under a crisis alert
right now because of the fires in the canyon.

59
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,150
The fact is, I don't think I can free up
any resources for you now.

60
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,037
I only need one thing.

61
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,435
<i>(tapping in numbers)</i>

62
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,039
- <i>(woman) Hollywood Blood Bank.</i>
- Hi. This is Marty Mulder from Payroll.

63
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,476
I have a question regarding
the W-4 form of a recent employee.

64
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,438
- <i>You mean Frank?</i>
- When was he hired?

65
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,149
<i>A couple of weeks ago.</i>
<i>He's the night watchman.</i>

66

<i>(stair creaks)</i>

67
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,879

- Hey! Easy, man! Easy!

68
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,677
Sorry, man. I didn't know you were there.

69
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,390
Damn freak night watchman down there
always breaking the light bulbs.

00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,672
You're killing me!
Turn 'em off! Turn 'em off!

78
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,954
- Tell us your real name.
- Please! I can't take it.

79
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,476
Turn off the lights!
You're killing me. Turn them off!

80
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,837
Please!

81
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,990
Turn off the lights!

82
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,832
Please!

83
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,951
Turn 'em off!

84
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,911
That better?

85
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,989
I'll only talk to <i>him.</i>

86
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,671
Lucky you.

87
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,279
You know what we are.

88
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,749
What are you?

89
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,273
He is the Father, I am the Son
and she is the Unholy Spirit.

90
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,632
And the three of you killed Garrett Lorre.

91
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,195
No.

92
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,919
Your fingerprints were found
at the crime scene.

93
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,677
No. When a snake eats a fly,
it's not murder. Itjust <i>is.</i>

94
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,349
Frogs eat flies.

95
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,991
Are you dead?

96
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,154
- I never will be.
- You believe that?

97
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,074
Don't <i>you</i> wanna live for ever?

98
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,319
Well, not if drawstring pants
come back into style.

99
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,156
Look, what nobody realises
is that there is no afterlife.

100
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,710
I know this - listen to me, listen to me.
I know this because...

101
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,872
...when we prolong our lives
by taking theirs...

102
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,829
...all I see is such... horror in their eyes.

103
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,595
And that's because at that moment
they're face to face with death.

104
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,752
And then suddenly they realise
there's nothing else.

105
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,960
There's no heaven. There's no soul.
There's just rot and there's just decay.

106
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,918
And I will never, ever, ever,
ever have to face that.

107
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,433
It's a stiff price, though. Look at yourself.
Drinking blood, living in darkness.

108
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,355
Unable to see your reflection in a mirror.
Or is thatjust a myth?

109
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,910
I can't be seen in a mirror.

110
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,797
Look, anything worth anything has a price.

111
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,669
And when I'm standing next to your deathbed
looking as young as I look right now...

112
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,151
...and I see that fear in your eyes
at the moment of death...

113
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,710
...then, then tell me the price is too stiff.

114
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,519
It's more likely I'll be looking into your eyes
before they lead you into the gas chamber.

115
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,192
But that's a moment you won't have to face
if you tell me where the others are.

116
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,716
Why would I?
They're the only ones that can kill me.

117
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,394
If you are what you say you are...

118
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,230
...I know what can kill you.

119
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,069
It'd be very easy to cover those windows.
Just tell me where the other two are.

120
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,312
In a couple of hours,
there'll be no escaping the sun... Son.

121
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,469
If he wants to talk,
cover the windows and call me.

122
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,075
What if he turns into a bat
and flies out through the bars?

123
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,790
That man is delusional, but I get the sense
that not even he believes his own claims.

124
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,030
We've gotta play along with his beliefs.

125
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,157
I'm hoping that the sunlight
will give him an excuse to talk.

126
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,075
- Go back to your hotel and get some sleep.
- I didn't check in to a hotel room.

127
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,151
I don't sleep any more.

128
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,073
<i>(screaming)</i>

129
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,755
Number four! Right away!
Number four, right away!

130
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,554
<i>(screaming)</i>

131
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,274
<i>(laboured breath)</i>

132
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,752
An oedema ball at the nostrils, rupture of
the skull due to internal steam pressure.

133
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,674
These are indications of long exposure
to extreme temperatures...

134
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,830
...not a sunburn for 15 seconds.

135
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,912
The guards found no flammable materials?

136
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,195
I had believed that...

137
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,793
...this man's illness was psychological.

138
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,754
There is a condition
known as Gunther's Disease.

139
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,038
Congenital erythropoietic porphyria
creating cutaneous photosensitivity.

140
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,590
I'm familiar with porphyria.
It causes lesions and blisters...

141
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,911
...when skin is exposed to sunlight,
not fourth-degree burns.

142
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,118
Sufferers have a deficiency which can be
supplemented by a small ingestion of blood,

143
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,590
...not... the kind of bloodthirst
that this man had.

144
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,512
It's probably ignorance of porphyria as
a disease that led to the vampire myths...

145
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,989
...in Asia in the Middle Ages.

146
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:28,155
I had... dismissed the possibility of the
actual existence of such a creature as myth.

147
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,992
You are really upsetting me...
on several levels.

148
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,315
- When will you get the blood tests back?
- Next week.

149
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,189
What's this purple stain here?

150
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,837
Could be an ink stamp,
like they give at a party or a club.

151
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,115
Can you read it?

152
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,516
It is possible that the heat burned the ink
permanently into the lower levels of the skin.

153
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,911
An old coroner's trick.

154
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,436
I can make a quarter appear
from behind your ear.

like me is doing in a place like this?

157
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,789
How do you define normal?

All I know is, uh...

161
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,513
...normal is not what I feel.

162
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,635
You've lost someone.

163
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,878
Not a lover. A friend.

164
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,111

You're not interested
in this place, in what we do.

168
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,079
- How do you know?
- You're afraid of me.

169
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,109
I take the life of others...

170
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,638
...inside me... into my blood.

171
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,549
I need to know.

172
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,630
And all day long I deal with equity...

173
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,917
...notes, bonds...

174
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,190
Nothing that's real.

175
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,477
And this gives my life... life.

176
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,191
My name's Kristen.

177
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,991
It's a normal name.

178
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,629
AIDS.

179
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,591
Aren't you afraid?

180
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,469
I wish I <i>could</i> die.

181
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,789
The Father, the Son.

182
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,038
I don't know who you are, freak,
but we're two consenting adults.

183
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,157
Now, get the hell outta here.

184
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,591
Kristen?

185
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,591
Kristen?

186
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,471
Kristen?

187
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,391
Come out.

188
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,831
Hm.

189
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,111
It's my turn.

190
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,637
Don't worry. I took care of that guy.

191
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,911
I told you I'd protect you.

192
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,716
<i>(screaming)</i>

193
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,835
The murderers cut off the power supply
at some point, and the phone. Fits their MO.

194
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,515
This is our forensic dentist
you requested. Doctor Jacobs.

195
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,874
How do you do?

196
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,511
I don't wanna bias your report, but I need
a preliminary examination for anything...

197
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,591
...unnatural.
- Uh-huh.

198
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,589
Shine the light down here.

199
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,711
Agent Mulder?

200
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,948
All this time I've been putting
raspberry sauce on ice cream.

201
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,351
Check these prints. One will be the victim's.
The other should be the woman we're after.

202
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,152
The bites are not done by an animal.
These are human.

203
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,429
And, realise this is a cursory exam, but I'd
say they were made by three different people.

204
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,795
The Unholy Spirit.

205
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,112
We got the front. You go around the back.
You, check the garage.

206
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,231
OK, do it. Open her up.

207
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,676
Ms Kilar? Los Angeles Police Department.
We have a warrant to search the premises.

208
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,993
I found these. Veterinary needles.

209
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,959
The size matches the puncture wounds
on the previous victims.

210
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,992
And look at this. From a snakebite kit.
It's placed over the wound to extract poison.

211
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,230
- Only this one...
- Has blood in it.

212
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,193
Detective?

213
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,271
Over here.

214
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,476
The other side down.

215
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,438
Well, she wasn't at work and she's not here.

216
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,958
She's gone, and she's not coming back.

217
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,076
<i>(sirens and helicopters)</i>

218
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,951
<i>(door closes)</i>

219
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:01,795
Special Agent Fox Mulder,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

220
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,114
They're after you.

221
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,751
- How do you know?
- The bread. Legends in Eastern Europe.

222
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,595
It's said that one can protect oneself
by eating bread filled with blood.

223
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,069
You were protecting yourself.

224
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,909
And now you're protecting me?

225
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:32,358
I think it's best if I took you into
protective custody. They'll kill once more.

226
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,829
They'll try to kill you.

227
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,149
Why are you here alone?

228
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,959
Because you think you're not afraid?

229
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:52,712
Because you need to know? You need
to know they are who you believe they are.

230
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,669
What I believe <i>you</i> to be.

231
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,634
One change in the wind
and the fires will move this way.

232
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,915
Have you ever tasted blood?

233
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,915
No, you haven't.

234
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,518
Blood tastes... dangerous.

235
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,234
It's sweet... and thick.

236
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:36,678
You were in Memphis and Portland
when the other murders occurred.

237
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,629
How are you connected?

238
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,792
When I was a little girl, my father beat me.

239
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,669
Abuse is too frail a word.

240
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,598
He showed his love for me by beating me.

241
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,431
I was dead.

242
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,708
One night he hit me so hard, he knocked out
two teeth and locked me in my room.

243
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,510
The blood poured
from my mouth onto the floor...

244
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,635
...and down my throat.

245
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,119
It was the only way I knew I was alive.

246
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,869
I met John in Chicago.

247
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,120
You know him as "the Son".

248
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,954
He also beat me.
I guess that's the way it works sometimes.

249
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,274
He hit me once and cut open my lip.

250
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:57,592
I was angry... and as revenge
I jumped on him and I bit through his lip.

251
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,951
He tasted my blood...

252
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,391
...and I tasted his.

253
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,638
After that we were into blood sports.

254
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,871
But...

255
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,351
I never...

256
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,197
I lost him.

257
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,597
One night he came home
with two others and it turned...

258
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,031
...unnatural.

259
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,670
I left him and I moved to Memphis.

260
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,398
But they followed you. They want you.

261
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,389
I'm tired of running.

262
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,234
And you're here to protect me.

263
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,109
Are you trying to ward me off?

264
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,114
It's from someone <i>I lost.

265
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,269
Well, I hope you find her.

266
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,309
The one you lost, John, he's...

267
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,835
...dead.

268
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,230
But they've picked up another.
They're three again.

269
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,593
Kristen, I think you'll be safer if you
come back to the police station with me.

270
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,875
Without him, they won't come for me.

271
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,391
I won't go.

272
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,951
Then I won't go.

273
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,590
You need to get cleaned up.

274
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,194
Mm.

275
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,270
<i>(knocking)</i>

276
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,351
Yeah?

277
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,431
No mirrors.

278
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,959
I don't like the way I look.

279
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,429
It makes this hard.

280
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,591
I'll do it.

281
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,516
<i>(winces)</i>

282
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,469
It's not who you are.

283
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,670
It doesn't make you happy.

284
00:36:03,643 --> 00:36:05,634
I've been watching.

285
00:36:06,803 --> 00:36:10,113
I had to wait for you to finish.

286
00:36:12,163 --> 00:36:14,154
I had to wait to tell you...

287
00:36:15,163 --> 00:36:17,154
...it's true.

288
00:36:18,163 --> 00:36:20,552
I was as surprised as anybody.

289
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:28,118
You can live for ever.

290
00:36:29,683 --> 00:36:33,961
Everybody else just dies,
but we, we come back.

291
00:36:35,683 --> 00:36:37,878
The Spirit showed me.

292
00:36:41,603 --> 00:36:43,992
And now she'll show you.

293
00:36:50,003 --> 00:36:52,995
We live in a different world, Kristen.

294
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:55,916
And nobody on the outside can end my life.

295
00:36:56,443 --> 00:36:58,752
You can't kill me.

296
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:02,916
But I can kill... you.

297
00:37:04,963 --> 00:37:09,593
I know, Kristen, what I did to you was...

298
00:37:10,803 --> 00:37:14,796
If I were to die, I would certainly
go to hell for what I did.

299
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:19,478
But I love you, and I can atone for eternity.

300
00:37:23,363 --> 00:37:25,354
Kill him...

301
00:37:26,563 --> 00:37:28,997
...and we'll be together.

302
00:37:29,843 --> 00:37:31,879
You've got to drink the blood of a spirit.

303
00:37:31,963 --> 00:37:34,796
- But he's not...
- No! He is.

304
00:37:34,883 --> 00:37:37,602
A spirit is one who believes.

305
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:40,512
He knows we're possible.

306
00:37:43,003 --> 00:37:46,154
You don't have much time
before the sun comes up.

307
00:37:49,523 --> 00:37:51,514
Cut him open...

308
00:37:52,643 --> 00:37:54,634
...and we'll finish.

309
00:38:13,963 --> 00:38:15,954
You have to go.

310
00:38:16,843 --> 00:38:19,038
- Are they here?
- The fire...

311
00:38:19,643 --> 00:38:22,919
- You have to go.
- My car's down the hill.

312
00:38:23,003 --> 00:38:27,599
- Mine's in the garage. The keys are in it.
- You have to get your things.

313
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,714
I'll be right there.

314
00:38:51,683 --> 00:38:54,436
He's not dead!

315
00:38:55,123 --> 00:38:58,035
John's alive. I saw him.

316
00:39:00,563 --> 00:39:02,554
Come on.

320
00:41:25,443 --> 00:41:27,434

You can't kill us!

322
00:41:30,683 --> 00:41:32,674
You're not one of us.

323
00:41:33,803 --> 00:41:35,794
But I will be.

324
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,278
I'm tasting the blood of a believer.

325
00:41:46,683 --> 00:41:49,072
But you haven't taken a life.

326
00:41:59,363 --> 00:42:01,160
I'll take mine.

327
00:42:01,403 --> 00:42:03,758
Don't do that. Don't do that! Don't!

328

Don't! Don't! No, don't!

00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:08,081
Don't!

330
00:42:35,483 --> 00:42:37,474
Agent Mulder.

331
00:42:40,923 --> 00:42:44,233
I'm sorry. We found four bodies.

332
00:42:44,323 --> 00:42:46,314
All dead.

333
00:42:49,523 --> 00:42:53,516
- No remains?
- The fire was extremely hot.

334
00:42:53,603 --> 00:42:55,992
It's just ashes and bones.
