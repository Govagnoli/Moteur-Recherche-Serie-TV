- WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT ?
-THE TESTS REVEALED...

324
00:28:43,084 --> 00:28:48,573
SOMETHING PECULIAR IN AN AREA
OF THE BRAIN THAT WE ARE ONLY
BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND--

325
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:53,578

THAT NEURO-PHYSICISTS ARE
CALLING THE "GOD MODULE."

THE NEXT CHRIST CHILD.

328

ALL OF THE BOY'S BRAIN
PROCESSES ARE SHOWING...

329
00:29:01,502 --> 00:29:04,672
EXTRAORDINARY ACTIVITY IN
EXACTLY THIS PART OF THE BRAIN,

330
00:29:04,672 --> 00:29:08,443
WHICH IS NOT JUST
ABNORMAL OR ANOMALOUS,

331
00:29:08,443 --> 00:29:11,079
BUT FROM WHAT I KNOW,
ABSOLUTELY UNHEARD OF.

INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE
BEEN RESPONSIBLE...

00:29:22,724 --> 00:29:25,727
THAT ARE SUGGESTIVE OF ACCESS
TO SPECIAL BRAIN CENTERS.

337
00:29:25,727 --> 00:29:27,729
ALL RIGHT, SO THIS KID
IS A HUMAN ODDITY.

338
00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:30,815
WOULD SOMEBODY TELL ME
WHY ANYONE WOULD GO TO SUCH
GREAT LENGTHS TO KILL HIM ?

339
00:29:30,815 --> 00:29:34,268
THIS KID MAY BE THE KEY,
NOT JUST TO ALL HUMAN POTENTIAL,
