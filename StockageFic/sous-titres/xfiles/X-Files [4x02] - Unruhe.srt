became kind of famous for taking
what he called "thought-o-graphs."

105
00:08:37,397 --> 00:08:40,389
He claimed that by concentrating
on an unexposed film negative,

106
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,437
he could create
a photographic representation
of what he saw in his mind.

180

It appears under
three different spellings.

181
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:46,597
- None within 80 miles of here.
- It might be significant as a word.

182
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:50,904
That's what I've been thinking.
Apparently, in German
it means "trouble" or "strife."

This guy's obviously
very good at what he does.

He's left behind no witnesses,
no latent prints.

The only thing he's left
are those photos,

201
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:40,225
which leads me to believe he doesn't
even know he has that abiliry.
