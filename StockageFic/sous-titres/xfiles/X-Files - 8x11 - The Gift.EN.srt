It's all right here.

For a year he was going
to doctors.

00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:02,161
There's a clear record
of his decline.

How well did you really know him?

11
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:08,759
Howfar would Mulder go?

12
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:11,167
How far would he go for what?

on a Saturday.

21
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,919
Hate to say you're
wasting your time.

22
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:04,752
Not if you confiirm
what you told me before.

23
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:07,884
Yes, sir. Agent Mulder
was here, all right...

24
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:09,223
last spring.

25
00:04:09,296 --> 00:04:12,891
You said on the phone
Agent Mulder was investigating

26
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:15,264
a missing woman,
Marie Hangemuhl.

27
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:17,327
Well, she wasn't
exactly missing.

28
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:19,971
He wasn't exactly
investigating, either.

29
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,940
I'm not following you.

30
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:23,805
It was a false report.

31
00:04:23,877 --> 00:04:25,674
Marie never even
left the house.

32
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:28,680
The only reason Agent Mulder
found out about it was

33
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:31,741
because Marie's sister got
all excited about nothing.

34
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:35,276
There.

35
00:04:35,355 --> 00:04:36,788

No, thanks.

39
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:46,095
You know, if you don't mind me asking,
Agent Doggett

40
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,066
what's your interest?

41
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:49,761
I mean, I was
actually surprised

42
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:51,997
that one FBI agent gave
this case a thought.

43
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:55,371
It's not so much the case
as it is the agent.

44
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:57,941
Agent Mulder disappeared
last May.

45
00:04:58,011 --> 00:04:59,137
Sorry to hear that.

46
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:01,271
I still don't see what
that has to do with us.

47
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:03,111
Did Agent Mulder have
a personal connection here--

48
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:04,741
something that might not be
in your report?

49
00:05:04,818 --> 00:05:06,149
No, I don't think

00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:08,744
he'd ever been to Squamash
before, as far as I know.

I have cell phone records
showing that

00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,984

the week before he disappeared.

This is an FBI agent.

He wants to ask us
a few questions.

63
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:56,200
What's this all about?

64
00:05:56,236 --> 00:05:58,727

way out of proportion.

I didn't want
her to worry.

That's all, I didn't mean...

00:08:02,996 --> 00:08:04,759
Let me ask you something,
Agent Doggett.

111
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:05,957
Was this Mulder guy sick?

112
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:08,797
Sick in the head,
I mean?

113
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:10,358
Is that why you're checking
into this?

114
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:13,872
What stories, Mr. Hangemuhl?

115
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,339
An Indian folk legend

116
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,469
about a creature who lives
out in the woods.

117
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:21,173
I've heard these stories
since I was a kid.

118
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,509
So your colleague
twisted it

119
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:25,312
into a theory that she was going
to disappear, all right

120
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:26,579
'cause this creature was

121
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,082
coming to eat her.

122
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:30,820
Eat her?

123
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,517

I hate to waste
your Saturday.

126

The Hangemuhls own
a gun, Kurt?

127
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:45,595
No, I don't think so. Why?

128
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,272
I saw three holes
plastered over

129
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,602
in their living room wall.

130
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:51,603
Gunshots?

131
00:08:51,845 --> 00:08:53,107
Possibly.

132
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:55,204
You want to go back
and ask'em?

133
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,512
No.

134
00:10:46,326 --> 00:10:49,022
Kurt, they told me
you were out here.

135
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:50,926
I just can't believe it.

136
00:10:50,997 --> 00:10:53,727
Is it true?

137
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:55,935
That's what
I'm here to fiind out.

138
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:20,185
Were you aware Mulder carried
a second weapon, a Walther PPK?

139
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:21,624
Yeah, in an
ankle holster.

140
00:11:21,694 --> 00:11:23,628
I found it hidden
under his sink.

141
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:25,561
The clip was three rounds shy.

142
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,124
What's this about?

143
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:30,066
Three shots
were fiired in a house

144
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:32,401
where Mulder investigated
a case last May.

145
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:34,440
He never fiiled
a report on the case

146
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:36,236
or the discharge
of his weapon.

147
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:37,708
Do you know any reason why?

148
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:40,575
If Mulder did these things,
he would've reported them.

149
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:43,104
Mulder submitted
case reports, all right

150
00:11:43,182 --> 00:11:45,673
but they indicate
he was here in Washington

151
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:49,483
on days his cell phone records
prove he was in Pennsylvania.

152
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:51,750
Are you calling Mulder a liar?

153
00:11:54,093 --> 00:11:56,061
This is the muzzle
of Mulder's pistol.

154
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:57,323
You see that there?

155
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:01,131
It's blowback.

of dried blood

in a semi-circular pattern.

158
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:07,801
Which indicates Mulder fiired
close-range at something

159
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,065
or someone.

160
00:12:09,142 --> 00:12:10,302
I've heard enough.

161
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,336
Where are you going?

162
00:12:12,412 --> 00:12:13,777
It's where
you're going, Agent Doggett.

163
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:15,571
You're trying to
build a case that what?

164
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:18,014
Mulder killed a man and then
made himself disappear?

165
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:19,278
That's not what happened.

166
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:21,149
I told you before, he
was abducted. I saw it!

167
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,518
Agent Mulder signed
falsifiied case reports.

168
00:12:23,556 --> 00:12:26,650
Oh, come on,John, this isn't
about Mulder, it's about you!

169
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:27,818
Your career.

and back on the fast-track
to the directorship.

00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:37,198

to fiind the truth.

Why not?

177
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:44,373
Because she...

178
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,571
She signed those
case reports, too.

179
00:13:03,863 --> 00:13:07,094
You take that story to OPR

180
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:11,626
the accusation alone
could cost Scully her job.

181
