1
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,497
Radio check.
Perimeter is clear.

2
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,038
Copy that.
Give me a check every ten.

3
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:44,572
Why don't you folks make
yourselves comfortable?

4
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:46,976
Watch some television.
Get some rest.

5
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,712
Try to put your minds at ease.

6
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:57,283
Just try to stay away from the windows
and the doors, if you would.

7
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,655
Do we have to ask you
if we can use the bathroom?

8
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,990
I feel like I'm a prisoner
in my own home.

9
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,862
Ma'am, I apologize for the imposition,
but my job is to protect you.

10
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:09,459
As of this evening, the FBI's
top priority is keeping you safe.

11
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:12,369
For how long?
A week, a month? Then what?

12
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,373
Jim, don't do this, please.

13
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,377
You don't have to testify.

14
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:22,142
It's not worth it. These people have
a long reach. They're powerful.

15
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,274
I have to do this.

16
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,612
I'm going to bed.

17
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,502
Thank you.

18
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,472
The grand jury convenes at 9:00.
We'll leave here at 7:30.

19
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,974
I'll be right outside
the door if you need me.

20
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,427
Jim?

21
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,943
Jim?

22
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,275
Are you feeling all right?

23
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,712
Jim?

24
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,779
Mr. Skinner!
Mr. Skinner!

25
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,555
- Jim!
- Dr. Scobie?

26
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,562
- Jim!
- Ma'am.

27
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:45,311
Yes, at the time I was
in another part of the house.

28
00:04:46,652 --> 00:04:49,917
Yes. Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

29
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:53,186
Yes, sir, I will have
answers for you. I...

30
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,193
I...

31
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,267
- Rough night?
- It's shaping up to be
a rougher morning.

32
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:06,270
Follow me.

33
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:11,843
There's fingerprints everywhere, but
as they all belong to the deceased...

34
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,845
and his wife,
they don't help us.

35
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,847
- This is where the body was found?
- Yeah.

36
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,849
What can you tell us about him?

37
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:23,514
Dr. James Scobie, age 44,
R&D biochemist with Morley Tobacco.

38
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:26,752
If he were alive
as of 26 minutes ago,

39
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:31,058
he'd be giving testimony
against his former employer
before a federal grand jury.

40
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,963
Testimony concerning what?

41
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,126
Not even his wife or his lawyer
know the specifics.

42
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,670
Only that it concerns research
that he was involved in.

43
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,229
Potentially extremely
damaging to Morley.

44
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:44,140
Enough so that Scobie
received death threats.

45
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:48,405
Given the high profile
nature of the case,

46
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:53,214
the director charged me
with insuring Dr. Scobie's protection.

47
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:58,417
- And you think that someone
made good on these threats?
- I do.

48
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,824
Though we've yet to determine
how someone got in here or...

49
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,494
what killed him.

50
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:11,227
You can't blow a whistle
with a mouth like that.

51
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:15,239
It's almost as if his flesh
has been stripped or eaten away.

52
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,066
I mean, an assailant
could have thrown acid on him.

53
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:23,081
Well, if it was acid in the face,
he would have screamed bloody murder.

54
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,549
Well, we're looking
at all possibilities, Agent.

55
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,848
We need answers.
We don't have a lot of time.

56
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,686
And we're going up against one of
the biggest corporations in America.

57
00:06:31,757 --> 00:06:35,887
The director instructed me that he wants
this case closed as swiftly as possible.

58
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:37,929
I trust I can count
on your help.

59
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:44,732
All right, I want you
to perform the autopsy.
The body's in the county morgue.

60
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,738
- I'll get right on it.
- Thank you.

61
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,611
- Huh.
- What?

62
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:57,308
There's no ashtrays.
Dr. Scobie and his wife don't smoke?

63
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,317
Not that I witnessed.

64
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,512
Tobacco employee
that doesn't smoke.

65
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,215
Isn't that kind of like
a GM executive who drives a Ford?

66
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,487
If this was a hit,
it seems unnecessarily high profile.

67
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,755
It kind of draws attention
to itself, don't you think?

68
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:13,663
That could be the point...
to intimidate potential witnesses.

69
00:07:13,732 --> 00:07:16,132
Scobie had a supervisor at Morley...
a Dr. Peter Voss.

70
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,966
- I wanna talk to him.
- You mind if I tag along?

71
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,302
- No.
-  Sir?

72
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,191
We're here to see Dr. Voss.

73
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,362
Do you have an appointment?

74
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,938
Do you have an appointment?

75
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,641
Maybe you missed this
the first time around.

76
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,775
Gentlemen, I can help you.

77
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:11,386
Daniel Brimley, head
of corporate security. A pleasure.

78
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,823
Nice to meet you.

79
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:17,624
- You're here concerning
Dr. Scobie's death, I take it?
- We are.

80
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:22,224
We were all extremely sorry
to hear about it. Jim has a lot
of friends in this building.

81
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:26,237
Really? No hard feelings that
he was about to turn federal
witness against your company?

82
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,466
Nobody was happy about
Jim's decision,

83
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,236
but the timing of his death
couldn't have been worse.

84
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,074
So you have no problem
with us speaking to Dr. Voss?

85
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:37,172
Absolutely not.
Whatever we can do to help. Please.

86
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,919
Could you, um...

87
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:51,224
Could you give my sincerest
condolences toJim's wifeJoan?

88
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,231
How is she?

89
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:57,235
I'm sure she'll take comfort
in finding out why her husband died.

90
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:02,002
Dr. Voss, can you enlighten us
as to what Dr. Scobie intended
to tell the grand jury?

91
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,133
We know it had to do with
company research.

92
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:06,370
I'm sorry.
Dr. Voss would be in violation...

93
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:09,778
of his employment confidentiality clause
in answering that question.

94
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:13,511
- Dr. Scobie was your friend?
- Yeah, for 14 years.

95
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:16,110
And yet you demoted him
five weeks ago.

96
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:19,419
You took him off a particular project.
Can you tell us why that happened?

97
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:22,289
As before, Dr. Voss
would be in violation...

98
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:26,263
of his confidentiality clause
in answering questions regarding
the nature of his work...

99
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,425
here at Morley.

100
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,901
I'm sure you understand
our cooperation cannot extend itself
to revealing corporate secrets.

101
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:35,168
I'm not sensing any cooperation
whatsoever.

102
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,403
In fact, I'm one more nonanswer
away from getting...

103
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:41,310
a federal warrant and searching
this entire building.

104
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,110
- Then this meeting is over. Dr. Voss.
- Dr. Voss.

105
00:09:45,684 --> 00:09:48,118
Can you tell me
what that is?

106
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:58,324
- It's a tobacco beetle. Why?
- I found it atJim Scobie's house.

107
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:01,560
Well, you'll find a lot of these
around here. They're everywhere.

108
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:04,363
There's probably a dozen
in the grill of your car right now.

109
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:07,599
May I ask where
you're going with this, Agent?

110
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,607
I'm sorry. I can't.

111
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:12,405
Answering that question
would violate FBI confidentiality...

112
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:15,242
due to the sensitive nature
of our investigation.

113
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:03,658
Evenin'.

114
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:09,363
- What are you doing here?
- I run out of smokes.

115
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:14,563
Me and Dr. Scobie
had an arrangement, as you know.

116
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:19,301
So I figured, uh,
Dr. Scobie not bein' around,

117
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:23,814
that my arrangement with him...
slides on over to you.

118
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:39,229
Here ya go.

119
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:41,424
That won't hold me.

120
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:44,832
I'll bring you more.
Just don't come here anymore.

121
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:46,837
All right?

122
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:53,567
It seems everybody's actin' funny
around me all of a sudden, you know.

123
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:56,512
Tellin' me not to talk,
to stay away from their houses.

124
00:11:56,581 --> 00:12:01,109
- Huh.
- Too bad about Dr. Scobie.

125
00:12:01,186 --> 00:12:05,350
- Yeah.
- I bet people are wondering how he died.

126
00:12:05,423 --> 00:12:09,382
I've been working my own
theory up in the old noggin.

127
00:12:10,628 --> 00:12:12,789
I'd be happy to share it
with you someday.

128
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:16,296
I think that you should
leave now.

129
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:20,837
Yeah.

130
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,538
I don't wanna wear out
my welcome.

131
00:12:28,546 --> 00:12:31,037
We'll be seein' a lot
of each other, I expect.

132
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:48,192
- Smoke 'em if you got 'em.
- What have you found?

133
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:51,064
Well, the tissue damage
on Dr. Scobie's mouth extends...

134
00:12:51,135 --> 00:12:54,400
all the way down his trachea
into his lungs.

135
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:56,963
His alveoli looked
like corned beef.

136
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,942
What about this being the result
of some sort of corrosive agent?

137
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:03,708
No, that's not the case.
There's no acids present, no caustics.

138
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:07,512
This damage isn't the result
of any kind of chemical reaction.

139
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:11,316
His airways have more or less
just been reamed out.

140
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:16,284
- I can tell you what killed him,
strictly speaking.
- What?

141
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:20,263
Hypoxemia: The inability
to transfer oxygen...

142
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:22,299
from the lungs
to the bloodstream.

143
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:24,961
He choked to death?

144
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:27,300
All right.
I mean, this damage,

145
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:30,034
however it was accomplished,
someone did do this to him.

146
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:32,804
Well, not necessarily. There weren't
any signs of struggle in the room.

147
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:36,608
- Maybe no one was ever there.
- Where are you going with this?

148
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:40,344
Well, that this isn't a homicide.
You examined the body, Scully.

149
00:13:40,418 --> 00:13:43,046
Did you find any of these?

150
00:13:44,422 --> 00:13:46,652
- A bug?
- It's a tobacco beetle.

151
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:50,023
I didn't find anything
like that, Mulder.

152
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:52,688
Were you expecting me to?

153
00:13:52,764 --> 00:13:56,393
Killer bugs? This is what
I'm supposed to tell the director?

154
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:59,630
I don't know, but judging
from Dr. Voss's reaction to this,

155
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:01,695
I think it's the thing
we should investigate.

156
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,051
I've been tellin' you all week.
How many times I gotta say it?

157
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,145
No smoking!
You hear me?

158
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:53,622
America, man!

159
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:56,057
E Pluribus, uh...

160
00:14:56,127 --> 00:15:00,257
I'll get you kicked out, you son
of a bitch! You think I'm kiddin'?

161
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:02,390
I'll do it!

162
00:15:06,671 --> 00:15:08,935
The law's on my side!

163
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:15,198
Guests check in,
but they don't check out.

164
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:18,468
Well, judging from the condition
of the body,

165
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,567
I'd say that he died
in the same manner as Dr. Scobie.

166
00:16:21,644 --> 00:16:23,908
Except this man's no
corporate whistle blower.

167
00:16:26,282 --> 00:16:29,877
Thomas Gastall.
Out-of-date Massachusetts license,

168
00:16:29,952 --> 00:16:32,079
food coupons...

169
00:16:32,154 --> 00:16:35,817
and a certificate of completion for
a court-ordered anger management class.

170
00:16:35,891 --> 00:16:40,157
What could Morley Tobacco have against
a transient from Massachusetts?

171
00:16:40,229 --> 00:16:42,823
- Probably nothing.
- What are you suggesting, Mulder?

172
00:16:42,898 --> 00:16:47,164
ThatJim Scobie wasn't murdered.
Neither was this man.

173
00:16:47,236 --> 00:16:49,670
Well, then what killed them?

174
00:16:56,312 --> 00:16:58,246
These.

175
00:16:58,314 --> 00:17:01,147
We didn't find any insects
in Dr. Scobie's bathroom.

176
00:17:01,217 --> 00:17:03,685
But there was an open window
through which they could have escaped.

177
00:17:03,753 --> 00:17:07,951
It's a long shot, Mulder, but it could
be some form of contagious agent,

178
00:17:08,023 --> 00:17:11,288
like an insect-borne bacterium,

179
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,329
which would mean there might be
other victims in this building.

180
00:17:20,636 --> 00:17:22,570
FBI.

181
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:29,272
Sorry to wake you.

182
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:32,041
No, you didn't wake me.

183
00:17:37,953 --> 00:17:39,978
Come on in.

184
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,424
Thank you.

185
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:49,659
We're investigating the death
of the man who lived right next
to you... a Thomas Gastall.

186
00:17:49,732 --> 00:17:52,394
Do you know him?

187
00:17:52,468 --> 00:17:54,402
I knew his voice.

188
00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:57,472
He yelled a lot.

189
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,065
He yelled?

190
00:18:00,142 --> 00:18:02,542
Yeah, he said
I smoked too much.

191
00:18:06,115 --> 00:18:09,607
What are you gonna do, man?
It's a free country.

192
00:18:09,685 --> 00:18:11,619
E Pluribus, uh...

193
00:18:13,422 --> 00:18:15,720
- Do you mind?
- No.

194
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,658
You don't seem surprised
that he's dead.

195
00:18:18,727 --> 00:18:21,594
I guess his number come up.

196
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,767
I'm just glad it wasn't me.

197
00:18:27,903 --> 00:18:31,361
- Well, what is your name, sir?
- Darryl Weaver.

198
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,433
Mr. Weaver, did you see
or hear anything unusual last night?

199
00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:38,844
Little Korean fella down
the hall dresses like Wonder Woman.

200
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:44,413
- But that's every night.
- Other than that?

201
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,183
There wouldn't happen to be,
uh, any reward money involved,

202
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:54,786
would there?

203
00:18:54,864 --> 00:18:57,526
I mean, I could use
an extra buck or two.

204
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,503
The FBI would appreciate
your voluntary cooperation, sir.
That's the way it works.

205
00:19:03,606 --> 00:19:05,870
Ain't that always the way.

206
00:19:12,014 --> 00:19:16,644
No, my mind is, uh,
just drawin' a complete blank.

207
00:19:18,354 --> 00:19:20,288
That's my card.

208
00:19:22,157 --> 00:19:24,387
Thank you, Mr. Weaver.

209
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:33,301
Anything?

210
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:37,100
Two deaths in less than 24 hours
and we've yet to come up with an answer.

211
00:19:37,172 --> 00:19:40,335
And the only thing I have to go on
medically at this point is Mulder's bug.

212
00:19:42,544 --> 00:19:45,945
You know, I know an entomologist
at UNC Willmington... Dr. Libby Nance.

213
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:48,279
Good. Talk to her.

214
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,284
Where you going?

215
00:19:50,352 --> 00:19:53,549
To see about something else
that's been bugging me.

216
00:20:10,506 --> 00:20:12,440
- Mrs. Voss?
- Yes?

217
00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:14,999
Fox Mulder.
Is your husband home?

218
00:20:15,077 --> 00:20:18,308
- It's okay, honey.
It'll just be a minute.
- Sure thing.

219
00:20:26,188 --> 00:20:28,679
I really shouldn't be talking
to you without our lawyers.

220
00:20:28,757 --> 00:20:31,419
I understand your reluctance
to talk, sir.

221
00:20:31,493 --> 00:20:34,291
You have a nice family,
a lot to lose.

222
00:20:34,363 --> 00:20:36,831
What do you want, Agent Mulder?

223
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:39,959
There's been another victim...
Thomas Gastall.

224
00:20:40,035 --> 00:20:42,469
Died exactly the same way
Scobie did.

225
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,636
I'm sorry to hear that.

226
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,701
But what's that
got to do with me?

227
00:20:49,778 --> 00:20:53,236
Well, we found these
all over him.

228
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,480
I believe that that's
what killed both men.

229
00:20:58,954 --> 00:21:02,355
Tobacco beetle. It's an herbivore.
It eats tobacco.

230
00:21:02,424 --> 00:21:04,949
- Hence its name.
- I understand that,

231
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:07,325
but... maybe these don't.

232
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:10,388
- I'm not really required
to talk to you, am I?
- No.

233
00:21:10,466 --> 00:21:13,993
But why are you hiding
behind your lawyers, Doctor?

234
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:16,765
How many people have to die
before you do the right thing?

235
00:21:34,823 --> 00:21:37,155
- I'll get it!

236
00:21:39,261 --> 00:21:41,957
- Hello?
-  What did he want?

237
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:49,502
- Are you spying on me?
- I'm not spying on you, Peter.

238
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:52,942
I'm looking out for you.
What did he want?

239
00:21:55,044 --> 00:21:57,979
There's been another death...
downtown.

240
00:21:58,047 --> 00:22:00,709
- How did it happen?
- I don't know. I don't know.

241
00:22:00,783 --> 00:22:04,219
This has gone on long enough.
We should come forward. I should.

242
00:22:04,286 --> 00:22:07,050
Do you hear
what you're saying, Peter?

243
00:22:07,122 --> 00:22:11,024
Now, I want you to just
take a moment.

244
00:22:11,093 --> 00:22:14,028
I want you to think about
what really matters to you.

245
00:22:15,164 --> 00:22:17,962
Now tell me where
I can find Darryl Weaver.

246
00:22:18,033 --> 00:22:22,299
- Why?
- This was my mistake. I'll clean it up.

247
00:22:24,006 --> 00:22:26,941
- I don't know where he is.

248
00:22:31,146 --> 00:22:33,410
This doesn't make sense.

249
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:36,076
What doesn't make sense?

250
00:22:36,151 --> 00:22:40,781
Well, it's a Lasioderma serricorne...
a tobacco beetle.

251
00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:44,849
Only I've never seen one
exactly like this.

252
00:22:44,927 --> 00:22:47,691
Hmm. What are the differences?

253
00:22:47,763 --> 00:22:50,630
Physical differences.

254
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:52,633
Minor, but definitely notable.

255
00:22:52,701 --> 00:22:55,033
Deviations in the mandibles,
the antennae,

256
00:22:55,104 --> 00:22:57,698
the body segmentation.

257
00:22:57,773 --> 00:23:02,107
What if such deviations
arose from genetic engineering?

258
00:23:02,177 --> 00:23:04,873
- Engineering the bugs themselves?
- No.

259
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:08,815
I was actually thinking about
another possibility... transgenomics.

260
00:23:08,884 --> 00:23:13,014
- Which is?
- It's a form of DNA manipulation...

261
00:23:13,088 --> 00:23:15,818
alterations made
on the genetic level.

262
00:23:15,891 --> 00:23:18,917
It is pretty widely known that tobacco
companies have been pouring money...

263
00:23:18,994 --> 00:23:21,360
into that kind of research.

264
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,898
Changing the tobacco plant itself
in order to make it heartier,

265
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:27,925
give it less nicotine,
more nicotine,

266
00:23:28,003 --> 00:23:30,198
make it naturally
menthol flavored.

267
00:23:30,272 --> 00:23:33,969
- You name it.
- A form of what... super tobacco?

268
00:23:34,043 --> 00:23:37,809
Which possibly could have
created super bugs.

269
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,939
I guess the real question is,

270
00:23:40,015 --> 00:23:42,483
could they have become
dangerous to humans?

271
00:23:45,854 --> 00:23:47,788
Mr. Weaver!

272
00:23:49,892 --> 00:23:51,826
Mr. Weaver!

273
00:23:51,894 --> 00:23:54,362
Sorry, Doc. No vacancy.

274
00:23:55,964 --> 00:23:58,762
- What happened there?

275
00:24:00,035 --> 00:24:01,969
Well, you tell me.

276
00:24:02,037 --> 00:24:04,437
You're the one with the PhD.

277
00:24:04,506 --> 00:24:07,100
I'm just a big old guinea pig.

278
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,724
Uh, listen.

279
00:24:24,793 --> 00:24:27,353
Um, you have to leave town.

280
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,627
And give up all this?

281
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,759
Me not doin' my part
for science?

282
00:24:35,804 --> 00:24:37,795
Here.

283
00:24:37,873 --> 00:24:40,273
Take it. It's everything
I have in the bank.

284
00:24:40,342 --> 00:24:43,038
Four thousand.

285
00:24:46,381 --> 00:24:49,612
It's not much,
but, uh, it's a start.

286
00:24:53,555 --> 00:24:55,955
W-W-Wait a minute. I'm not kidding.
You gotta get out of here.

287
00:24:56,024 --> 00:24:57,958
Why?

288
00:25:00,662 --> 00:25:02,857
I got a good thing
goin' here.

289
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,165
I got cash money.

290
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:16,802
I got all the coffin nails
I can suck down.

291
00:25:20,482 --> 00:25:24,009
Although, lately,

292
00:25:24,086 --> 00:25:26,418
I've been thinkin'
this particular brand,

293
00:25:26,488 --> 00:25:29,616
it doesn't, uh,
do anyone else any favors,

294
00:25:29,691 --> 00:25:32,285
health-wise.

295
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:34,921
You thinkin' that too, huh?

296
00:25:41,403 --> 00:25:44,998
Would it bother you
if I lit one up?

297
00:25:49,044 --> 00:25:51,205
Toodles.

298
00:25:53,749 --> 00:25:55,683
No, you... you don't understand.

299
00:25:55,751 --> 00:25:59,118
Morley is a multibillion dollar
global corporation.

300
00:25:59,188 --> 00:26:02,521
You think they're gonna let you endanger
that, huh? They'll kill you first.

301
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:06,493
Well, it sounds like
a Darryl Weaver problem to me.

302
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:08,496
Yeah, uh...

303
00:26:40,796 --> 00:26:42,730
What am I looking at?

304
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,029
Thomas Gastall's left lung and bronchus.

305
00:26:46,101 --> 00:26:49,832
Well, I guess that explains
where the beetles came from.

306
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,178
Hey, Mulder.
Where have you been?

307
00:26:57,246 --> 00:27:00,738
Talking to lawyers over atJustice
tryin' to get a look at Morley's files.

308
00:27:00,816 --> 00:27:03,216
Well, take a look at this.

309
00:27:06,722 --> 00:27:10,385
They're the larval stage
of the tobacco beetle, Mulder.

310
00:27:10,459 --> 00:27:14,759
And somehow they have ended up
nesting in Thomas Gastall's lungs.

311
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:20,132
But what doesn't make any sense
is why Scobie's lungs didn't
show this same condition.

312
00:27:20,202 --> 00:27:23,763
The larvae must pupate
inside the lungs,

313
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:28,037
and then once they mature into beetles,
exit the body en masse.

314
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:31,568
- That explains the condition
of the face and throat.

315
00:27:31,647 --> 00:27:34,081
Only how did they get into
the lungs to begin with?

316
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:45,726
Mulder?

317
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:38,943
How is he?

318
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:43,778
They're using a deep suction
technique that's been designed
for asthma and cystic fibrosis.

319
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:47,182
And so far, we're having some luck
at clearing his lungs.

320
00:28:47,252 --> 00:28:51,120
- But?
- For every one of those things
that are in his lung tissue,

321
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:55,216
there may be a dozen eggs
that have yet to be hatched.

322
00:28:55,293 --> 00:28:58,387
- Eggs?
- His pulmonary tissue
is riddled with them.

323
00:28:58,463 --> 00:29:00,795
And they're going to hatch.
It's just, uh,

324
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:03,198
we're buying time.

325
00:29:03,268 --> 00:29:06,567
How did this happen? These eggs,
how'd they get into his lungs?

326
00:29:06,638 --> 00:29:08,572
I'm thinking he inhaled them.

327
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,600
Well, the tobacco beetle
lives out its life cycle on
or around the tobacco plant.

328
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,613
That's where it lays its eggs.

329
00:29:15,681 --> 00:29:18,673
If those genetically-altered beetles
that we found did that,

330
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:22,015
then maybe the eggs survived
the processing into cigarettes.

331
00:29:22,087 --> 00:29:24,885
- And have been carried
into Mulder's lungs as smoke?
- Right.

332
00:29:24,956 --> 00:29:28,323
Like spores or pollen.
Somehow small enough to be airborne.

333
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:32,261
But Mulder isn't a smoker.
And neither was Scobie.

334
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:35,390
Maybe they were around
someone who was.

335
00:29:44,342 --> 00:29:46,276
Don't bother calling security.

336
00:29:50,148 --> 00:29:52,241
Federal search warrant
as promised.

337
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:56,186
Do it.

338
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,824
You're gonna talk to me, Doctor.

339
00:30:00,892 --> 00:30:03,861
One of my agents is dying of
the same thing that killed Dr. Scobie.

340
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:06,420
I believe you have information
that can save him.

341
00:30:06,498 --> 00:30:09,956
We stand by our contention
that any information is proprietary...

342
00:30:10,035 --> 00:30:12,936
and is therefore the sole property
of Morley Tobacco.

343
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:16,140
Listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

344
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:19,041
This isn't about Morley
or your precious research.

345
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:22,171
This is about saving lives.

346
00:30:22,247 --> 00:30:25,045
- That's exactly what
we were trying to do.
- Dr. Voss.

347
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:28,382
I'm advising you
not to speak.

348
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,546
This has gone on long enough.

349
00:30:41,032 --> 00:30:44,195
We thought we were
doing a good thing.

350
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:48,035
We knew people were never gonna stop
smoking, no matter how unhealthy it was.

351
00:30:48,106 --> 00:30:51,542
So why not genetically
engineer a safer cigarette?

352
00:30:53,078 --> 00:30:55,979
Except you engineered
the bugs as well.

353
00:30:56,047 --> 00:30:58,379
We recruited test smokers.

354
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:01,317
We conducted focus groups.
There were no problems.

355
00:31:01,386 --> 00:31:04,378
And, uh, after
a few months in,

356
00:31:04,456 --> 00:31:08,483
things... things got bad.

357
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:15,030
We had four test subjects and, uh,

358
00:31:19,271 --> 00:31:21,603
three of them died.

359
00:31:24,409 --> 00:31:27,207
Is that what Dr. Scobie
was gonna testify about?

360
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,338
Yeah.

361
00:31:29,414 --> 00:31:33,145
And the company wanted us
to keep it quiet.

362
00:31:33,218 --> 00:31:37,348
I thought let's correct the mistakes
and face the consequences.

363
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,520
Jim didn't.

364
00:31:41,593 --> 00:31:44,357
He was monitoring
the focus group, and that's...

365
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:49,094
that's how he got infected.

366
00:31:52,304 --> 00:31:55,535
You said only three died.

367
00:31:55,607 --> 00:31:58,132
Who was the fourth?

368
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:18,887
- Clear!
- Okay, go ahead.

369
00:32:24,633 --> 00:32:28,660
- Told me he meant to get Weaver.
- Looks like Weaver got to him first.

370
00:32:32,841 --> 00:32:35,503
Mr. Brimley, can you hear me?

371
00:33:35,504 --> 00:33:38,064
You got Mickey's Big Mouth?

372
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,734
There's no smoking in here.

373
00:33:52,254 --> 00:33:55,189
Mickey's Big Mouth?

374
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:06,795
Anything else?
A carton of cigarettes?

375
00:34:06,869 --> 00:34:09,064
You don't have my brand.

376
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,904
Must be bad.

377
00:34:47,509 --> 00:34:49,670
How do you feel?

378
00:34:49,745 --> 00:34:52,441
Like a Dustbuster attacked me.

379
00:34:55,784 --> 00:34:58,480
We're looking for someone
who may be able to help you.

380
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,614
A Morley test subject
by the name of Darryl Weaver.

381
00:35:03,592 --> 00:35:07,961
Mr. E Pluribus. Yeah.

382
00:35:10,432 --> 00:35:14,163
Well, Mr. Weaver seems to have
some kind of tolerance or immunity,

383
00:35:14,236 --> 00:35:18,935
and we're hoping that once
we find him, we'll be able
to figure out how to treat you.

384
00:35:23,345 --> 00:35:25,939
Mulder?

385
00:35:32,087 --> 00:35:34,021
Doctor!

386
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,529
His sat's down to 72.

387
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,827
Get some O2 on him
and call the code.

388
00:35:43,899 --> 00:35:47,062
- Susan, code blue!
-  Right, Doctor.

389
00:35:49,238 --> 00:35:51,399
Over to my side!

390
00:36:20,201 --> 00:36:22,135
Dr. Scully?

391
00:36:23,671 --> 00:36:26,265
We've got him stabilized
on ECMO for the moment,

392
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,434
but we're not gonna be able
to maintain him on it for long.

393
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,944
Of course you see why.

394
00:36:32,013 --> 00:36:34,379
There's more than
there were six hours ago.

395
00:36:34,448 --> 00:36:39,476
They're beginning to block
the flow of blood.
Our best bet is to go back in there.

396
00:36:39,553 --> 00:36:42,579
I think this time
we have to crack the chest.

397
00:36:42,657 --> 00:36:44,488
No.

398
00:36:46,227 --> 00:36:50,755
No, uh, he's too weak for
thoracic surgery. He'd die on the table.

399
00:36:50,831 --> 00:36:53,823
I don't know what
our other options are.

400
00:36:56,003 --> 00:36:58,938
I'd say for the time being,
we just wait.

401
00:36:59,006 --> 00:37:01,941
That'll definitely kill him...

402
00:37:02,009 --> 00:37:04,273
sooner or later.

403
00:37:15,423 --> 00:37:18,517
Mrs. Voss, I'm Assistant
Director Walter Skinner with the FBI.

404
00:37:18,592 --> 00:37:21,789
- May we come in?
- What is this? What's going on?

405
00:37:21,862 --> 00:37:25,491
I have to ask for your cooperation.
These men are here to protect you
and your family.

406
00:37:25,566 --> 00:37:29,627
- Oh, my God. Why?
- Your husband hasn't
spoken to you about this?

407
00:37:29,704 --> 00:37:32,832
- He's not here.
- He told me he was headed home.

408
00:37:32,907 --> 00:37:36,343
- Try Dr. Voss at work.
- I've just been trying.
There's no answer.

409
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:07,405
Behind you.

410
00:38:15,116 --> 00:38:17,983
I was just leavin'.
I got what I came for.

411
00:38:18,052 --> 00:38:21,044
He took the test cigarettes.
I couldn't stop him.

412
00:38:22,723 --> 00:38:25,692
Stop right there!

413
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,694
Why?

414
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:32,565
You gonna shoot me?

415
00:38:32,633 --> 00:38:36,194
I'm not gonna let you go
and infect more people.

416
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,433
You're gonna let me do
whatever I wanna do.

417
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:44,243
Dr. Voss here tells me you need me.

418
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:49,842
You need me to save your boy.

419
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:51,714
Don't do it.

420
00:38:56,524 --> 00:38:59,652
They say these things
kill people, you know.

421
00:39:01,595 --> 00:39:03,460
Any brand,
sooner or later.

422
00:39:06,033 --> 00:39:08,866
But you know,
it doesn't have to be that way.

423
00:39:10,237 --> 00:39:12,865
I think Dr. Voss is really...

424
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,465
on to something
with his research, I do.

425
00:39:15,543 --> 00:39:18,137
It's over, Weaver.
I'm through.

426
00:39:18,212 --> 00:39:20,544
Oh.

427
00:39:20,614 --> 00:39:24,175
Come on, now.
I mean, you gotta figure...

428
00:39:27,822 --> 00:39:30,791
the first, uh, car...

429
00:39:30,858 --> 00:39:33,588
killed a bunch of people...

430
00:39:33,661 --> 00:39:35,652
before they perfected it,

431
00:39:35,729 --> 00:39:40,291
'cause it's all just part
of the scientific process, you know.

432
00:39:41,535 --> 00:39:43,935
Mr. Weaver, I will shoot you.

433
00:39:49,577 --> 00:39:51,511
No, you won't.

434
00:40:04,056 --> 00:40:07,219
I'm a regular damn
scientific marvel.

435
00:40:10,896 --> 00:40:14,161
They're gonna study me.

436
00:40:14,233 --> 00:40:18,431
They're gonna write
scientific papers about me.

437
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:22,098
I could be the cure for cancer.

438
00:40:25,044 --> 00:40:27,205
Me, Darryl Weaver.

439
00:40:38,457 --> 00:40:40,516
You ain't gonna shoot me.

440
00:40:49,435 --> 00:40:51,369
Toodles.

441
00:41:13,258 --> 00:41:15,852
-  How's Mulder?
- Not good.

442
00:41:19,665 --> 00:41:22,600
Let's get the blood work
on this man.

443
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:43,420
Wait a minute.

444
00:41:43,489 --> 00:41:45,650
Wait a minute.

445
00:41:45,724 --> 00:41:48,887
Give me 30 milligrams
of methyl-pyrrolidinyl-pyridine.

446
00:41:48,961 --> 00:41:50,986
- Nicotine?
- Yeah.

447
00:41:53,098 --> 00:41:55,464
I think this could
save Mulder's life.

448
00:42:09,548 --> 00:42:13,211
Hey. Good to be back?

449
00:42:13,285 --> 00:42:15,583
-  Beats the alternative.
- Yeah.

450
00:42:15,654 --> 00:42:19,317
Well, you'll be interested to know
that Morley Tobacco has subpoenaed...

451
00:42:19,391 --> 00:42:21,621
all of our files
on the case.

452
00:42:21,693 --> 00:42:26,426
- They seem extremely interested
in your recovery.
- What about Darryl Weaver?

453
00:42:26,498 --> 00:42:30,400
He's, uh, well enough to have
been moved to the hospital ward
at Riley Correctional.

454
00:42:30,469 --> 00:42:34,405
It was the nicotine itself
that was keeping him alive?

455
00:42:34,473 --> 00:42:37,965
His fingertips were stained yellow with
it. He was a four-pack a day smoker,

456
00:42:38,043 --> 00:42:41,103
far heavier than any
of the focus group members who died.

457
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:44,115
You know, nicotine is
extremely poisonous.

458
00:42:44,183 --> 00:42:46,674
It's actually one of
the oldest known insecticides.

459
00:42:46,752 --> 00:42:49,084
It's good for killing
tobacco beetles.

460
00:42:49,154 --> 00:42:52,089
Well, once we loaded your system up
with enough of it,

461
00:42:52,157 --> 00:42:55,456
it acted as a sort of
chemotherapy.

462
00:42:55,527 --> 00:42:58,519
Except it almost stopped
your breathing at the same time.

463
00:42:58,597 --> 00:43:00,861
That's not all it did.

464
00:43:07,506 --> 00:43:09,440
I bought these
on the way to work.

465
00:43:11,143 --> 00:43:13,338
You're not gonna start smoking.

466
00:43:13,412 --> 00:43:16,609
Why not? They say the addiction
is stronger than heroin.

467
00:43:16,682 --> 00:43:18,547
Mulder.

468
00:43:27,459 --> 00:43:30,189
Good. Skinner's waiting for us
in his office.

469
00:43:30,262 --> 00:43:32,321
I'll be right up.
