00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,357
- Oh, Daddy. Cut it out!
- I knew it was you, Dad.

5
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,989
- Quit picking on your brother. He loves you.
- No, I don't.

6
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,753
- I'm glad you're back home, Dad.
- Not as glad as I am.

7
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,990
Did you see a lot of weird stuff this year?

8
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,392
Yep. It was the weirdest show ever. But your
mother thinks you're getting ready for bed.

9
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,519
If she finds you guys still in the pool,
she's gonna kill me. So come on!

10
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,476
<i>(protests)</i>

11
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,030
Quit your whinin'.
Come on, or there's no bedtime story.

12
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,031
Out you go. That's it.

13
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,319

<i>(chomping)</i>

18
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,151
- What happened?
- Nothing you can ascertain from that photo.

19
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,277
He suffered from ichthyosis,
a congenital skin disease...

20
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,636
...characterised by the shedding
of the epidermis as scales.

21
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,796
This shows the entry wound
of the undetermined weapon.

22
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,317
No other injuries were inflicted.
No organs were removed or cannibalised...

23
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,994
...and there's no signs
of sexual molestation.

24
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,834
That's 48 attacks over the last 28 years...

25
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,912
...occurring in every state
in the continental US almost...

26
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,514
...the first in Oregon, the last five in Florida.

27
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,639
Victims range from all different
age groups, races. Both male and female.

28
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,633
The mutilations appear so motiveless
one would suspect a form of ritual...

29
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,676
...yet they adhere to no known cult.

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,993
A serial killer would normally escalate
the level of violence of his attacks...

31
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,753
...over such an extended period of time.

32
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,958
So what do <i>you</i> think, Scully?
What are your initial thoughts?

33
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,359
Imagine going through
your whole life looking like this.

34
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,509
The Lord is my shepherd;
I shall not want.

35
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,672
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:

36
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,911
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,991
He restoreth my soul:

38
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,312
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

39
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,790
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

40
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,836
...I will fear no evil:

41
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,990
For thou art with me;

42
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,470
thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

43
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,119
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies:

44
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,869
Thou anointest my head with oil;

45
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,269
my cup runneth over.

46
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,035
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me...

47
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,675
...all the days of my life:

48
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,389
And I will dwell in
the house of the Lord forever.

49
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,158
We are gathered here today to mourn
the passing of Jerald Glazebrook...

50
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,033
...beloved husband, father,
friend and entertainer.

51
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,915
We mourn not only the passing...

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,312
...of a man who overcame
the obstacles of his earthly incarnation...

53
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,234
...but also the passing of the love
that dwelled within his all-too-human heart.

54
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,910
We mourn the passing of
the admiration and the respect...

55
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,717
...he instilled in all
of his professional colleagues.

56
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,832
We mourn the passing of
the laughter and the enjoyment...

57
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,957
...he brought each audience who saw him.

58
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,396
For although Jerry was
a world-renowned escape artist...

59
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,553
...there is one strongbox
from which none of us can escape.

60
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,632
<i>(astonished murmurs)</i>

61
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,757
Help me.

62
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,631
Put him down over there.

63
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,871
<i>(crowd gasps)</i>

64
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,031
<i>(grunts)</i>

65
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,520
Not having known the deceased personally,
I'm in no position to perform a proper eulogy.

66
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,558
I'm sure he was a nice guy,
et cetera, et cetera.

67
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,279
But as an admirer of his work,
I <i>am</i> in a position...

68
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,999
...to perform an impromptu tribute
in his honour.

69
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,277
Namely, ramming this spike into my chest!

70
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,068
<i>(screams)</i>

71
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,312
- <i>(man)</i> Don't you have any respect?
- I think I hit my left ventricle!

72
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,391
Get back, fascists!

73
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,871
<i>(man)</i> Get him outta here!

74
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,471
I can't wait for the wake.

75
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,790
On his VICAP form,
Jerald Glazebrook was listed as an "artist".

76
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,236
Jerry <i>was</i> an artist.
The best escape artist since Houdini.

77
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,314
He should've been headlining Vegas, but his
condition kept him on the sideshow circuit.

78
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,791
- I didn't realise that sideshows still existed.
- There are two or three still around.

79
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,032
I got the impression that Glazebrook
wasn't the only performer residing here.

80
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,109
The town was founded in the '20s
when some of Barnum & Bailey's troupes...

81
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,316
...came down in the winter off-seasons.

82
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,717
This town's history might help
explain our case's history.

83
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,872
A sideshow performer
would have toured much of the country.

84
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,953
And their isolation from society,
caused by their physical deformities...

85
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,952
...could have built up
pathological resentment...

86
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,560
Now, now, hold on a second.

87
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,310
Now, now, hold on a second.

88
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,233
Around here we refer to them
as "very special people".

89
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,114
They may be different on the outside,
but it's what's inside that counts.

90
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,440
And on the inside...
they're as normal as anybody.

91
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,396
And on the inside...
they're as normal as anybody.

92
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,437
Until arrest, many serial killers...

93
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,308
...are considered by their friends
and family to be quite normal.

94
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,870
If you regard them as normal,
you must consider the possibility...

95
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,872
...that they are capable
of committing these crimes.

96
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,316
It's been my experience
that other people have a harder time...

97
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,995
...accepting these people's deformities
than they do themselves.

98
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,548
Sheriff, uh... what is this?

99
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,634
This design here. It's copyrighted
by Hepcat Helm. Is that a local artist?

100
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,435
A bit too local. His workplace
is right behind my station house.

101
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,229
Do you think that we could meet Hepcat?

102
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,552
<i>§ Watch my eyes when you light them up</i>

103
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,756

104
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,871
<i>(sheriff)</i> Hepcat.

105
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,355
Hepcat!

<i>(turns music off)</i>

108
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,069
- Who are the rubes?
- These are FBI agents Scully and Mulder.

109
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,957
This is Hepcat Helm.
He operates a carnival fun house.

110
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,555
Oh, man! How many times
have I told you not to call it that?

111
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,792
It's not some rinky-dink carny ride.
People go through it, they don't have fun.

112
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,555
They get the hell scared out of 'em.
It's not a fun house.

113
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,473
- It's a tabernacle of terror.
- It's a fun house.

114
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,394
I wanted to ask you about
this menu illustration.

115
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,508
I recognise most of the historical portraits
you've drawn here, but what's this here?

116
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,551
It's the Fiji Mermaid.

117
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,715
- Is that what that thing is?
- What's the Fiji Mermaid?

118
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,153
The Fiji Mermaid. It's... it's the Fiji Mermaid!

119
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,558
It's a bit of, uh... humbug
Barnum pulled in the last century.

120
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,428
Barnum billed it as a real live mermaid
but when people went in to see it...

121
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,877
...all they saw was a real dead monkey
sewn onto the tail of a fish.

122
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,350
- A monkey?
- A mummified monkey.

123
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,479
It supposedly looked so bad,
he had to exhibit it as a "genuine fake".

124
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,393
But see? That's why Barnum was a genius.

125
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,597
You never know where the truth ends
and the humbug begins.

126
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,078
He came right out and said this
Fiji Mermaid thing is just a bunch of BS.

127
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,349
That just made people wanna go and see it
even more. So I mean... who knows?

128
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,313
Maybe for box-office reasons Barnum
hawked it as a hoax, when in reality...

129
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,471
The Fiji Mermaid <i>was</i> a reality.

130
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,639
Sheriff, we're gonna need
a place to stay tonight.

131
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,554
There are lodgings right across the way,
but, uh... what's all this about?

132
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,313
These tracks were found
at several past crime scenes.

133
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,356
They've defied identification...

134
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,115
...but one expert speculated
that they might be simian in nature.

135
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,590
You're not telling me these tracks
were made by the Fiji Mermaid?

136
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,877
Do you recall what Barnum
said about suckers?

137
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,038
Tell me, have you done much
circus work in your life?

138
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,069
And what makes you think I've ever spectated
a circus? Much less been enslaved by one.

139
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,913
Many citizens here were circus hands
and I thought...

140
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,276
You thought that because
I am a person of short stature...

141
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,514
...that the only career I could procure for
myself would be one in the so-called big top.

142
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,835
You took one quick look at me and decided
that you could deduce my entire life.

143
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:03,234
Never would it have occurred to you
that a person of my height...

144
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,357
...could have possibly obtained a degree...

145
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,431
...in hotel management.

146
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,354
- I'm sorry. I meant no offence.
- Well, then, why should I take offence?

147
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,793
Just because it's human nature
to make instantaneous judgments of others...

148
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,553
...based solely upon
their physical appearances?

149
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,074
I've done the same thing to you, for example.

150
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,515
I've taken in your all-American features...

151
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,195
...your dour demeanour,
your unimaginative necktie design...

152
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,278
...and concluded
that you work for the government.

153
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,670
An FBI agent.

154
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,631
But do you see the tragedy here?

155
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,191
I have mistakenly reduced you
to a stereotype, a caricature...

156
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,910
...instead of regarding you
as a specific, unique individual.

157
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,191
But I am an FBI agent.

158
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,830
Register here, please.

159
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,638
Tell me, have you done much
circus work in your life?

160
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,950
I was on the stage for most of my life.

161
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,871
I was a headliner.

162
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,758
Did it not bother you
to have people staring at you?

163
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,469
Best work I ever had.
All I had to do was stand there.

164
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,275
Occasionally I'd say...

165
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,239
..."Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like you to meet my brother Leonard."

166
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,038
"Excuse him - he's a little shy."

167
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,998
Big laughs, I tell you. Big laughs.

168
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,071
Why did you give it up?

169
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,311
Mr Nutt, the kind-hearted manager here...

170
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:38,351
...convinced me that to make a living by
displaying my deformity lacked dignity.

171
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,829
So now I carry other people's luggage.

172
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,029
I believe these are your trailers.

173
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,994
If they are not, then I am wrong.

174
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,435
Oh.

175
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,958
That's most considerate.
Thank you very much.

176
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,359
Goodnight.

177
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,000
Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite.

178
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,754
No. No, that's not what I meant.

179
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,389
I didn't mean to imply we had bedbugs.

180
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,677
I meant to say don't let... Don't let the...

181
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,632
The Fiji Mermaids bite.

182
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,429
Yes, that's right. The Fiji Mermaids.
That's right.

183
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,796
That's... That's exactly...

184
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,319
Mulder, what is this Fiji Mermaid business?

185
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,676
Every murder inquiry begins with
a list of possible suspects.

186
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,036
You should try not to be so exclusive, Scully.

187
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,274
As long as <i>you</i> try not to let the atmosphere
here distort your list all out of proportion.

188
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,192
<i>§ I'm in a frenzy</i>

189
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,755
<i>§ Frenzy</i>

190
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,393
<i>§ This love gushes from my heart</i>

191
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,910
<i>§ Like water from a spout</i>

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,833

00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,840
<i>§ Ease my mind with your real cool line</i>

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,911

Uh... ma'am?

204
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,551
The sheriff, he wants to see you.

205
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,949
There's been another murder.

206
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,793
There's some blood on the window
we should send to the lab.

207
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,628
- Why run a test on the <i>victim's</i> blood?
- No, not this window. This window.

208
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,590
It seems to be the point of entry and there's
some blood on the outside of the window.

209
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,559
Why would there be blood <i>before</i> the attack?

210
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,155
Why didn't the attacker
just come through the open door?

211
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,233
For a person to crawl
in and out of these windows...

212
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,550
...they'd have to be a contortionist.

213
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,837
Or just plain crazy. Or both.

214
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,279
While they're performing
the autopsy, I wanna go down to the...

215
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,790
How many people do you know that can get
out of a straitjacket in under three minutes?

216
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,235
Fortunately, none.

217
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,112
We caught your act at the funeral.
That was some trick with the railroad spike.

218
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,317
Doctor Blockhead does not perform tricks.

219
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:59,431
Doctor Blockhead performs astounding acts
of body manipulation and pain endurance.

220
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,710
You must be one of those rare individuals
whose nerve endings don't register pain.

221
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,149
You just keep tellin' yourself that.

222
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,552
Have you ever performed this...
act on anyone else?

223
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,512
Are you sick? I tell audiences if they're
stupid enough to try this themselves...

224
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,229
...they'll end up with a slight lobotomy.
I am a professional.

225
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,155
Exactly how does one become
a professional, Blockhead? May I?

226
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,234
In my homeland of Yemen
I studied with yogis, fakirs and swamis...

227
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,357
...learning the ancient arts
of body manipulation.

228
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,036
But most men know nothing of these arts.

229
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,874
Did you know that through
the Chinese practice of <i>Tie Bu Shan...</i>

230
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,997
...you can train your testicles
to draw up into your abdomen?

231
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,310
I'm doing that as we speak.

232
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,352
I saw him this morning by the river.
He was eating a fish.

233
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,671
He knows between-show snacks'll
ruin his appetite.

234
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,550
I could be mistaken. Maybe it was another
bald, jigsaw-puzzle-tattooed naked guy.

235
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,949
Is this... man also a body manipulator?

236
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,998
No. In the classical sense,
the Conundrum's a geek.

237
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,674
- He eats live animals.
- He eats anything.

238
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,118
Live animals, dead animals, light bulbs,
corkscrews, battery cables, cranberries.

239
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,156
- Human flesh?
- Only the Conundrum can answer that.

240
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,392
But... he doesn't answer questions.
He merely poses them.

241
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,995
When an audience partakes in
the Conundrum's human piranha act...

242
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,389
...they are left to ask themselves...

243
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,350
"Why?"

244
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,949
But where are my manners?

245
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,031
Thank you.

246
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,674
It's an old sleight of hand
my uncle taught me.

247
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,116
He was only an amateur magician,
but he was better than those two.

248
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,714
I'll go to the lab to test
the blood on the window...

249
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,075
...against the blood on Blockhead's nail.

250
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,799
Everybody's uncle's an amateur magician.

251
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,957
Welcome to my museum.

252
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,316
May I put to rest any questions
you may have conjured?

253
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,676
I was just reading about
the fascinating life of Chang and Eng...

254
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,230
...and, uh... wondering
if their death was just as fascinating.

255
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,437
Oh, very much so.

256
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,557
On a cold January eve in 1874...

257
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,679
...Eng awoke to find his brother had
passed away during the course of the night.

258
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,548
A few hours later,
Eng himself departed from this world.

259
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,156
Now, these facts themselves may be
less than fascinating, but imagine.

260
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,710
Imagine being Eng, and lying there...

261
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,156
...knowing that essentially
half your body was now dead.

262
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,549
That the rest must inevitably follow.

263
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,677
And being able to do about it -
absolutely nothing.

264
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,789
At the autopsy it was officially concluded
that Chang died of a cerebral haemorrhage.

265
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,998
- What was the official cause of Eng's death?
- Fright.

266
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,471
Do you have any information
on blockhead or geek acts?

267
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,553
This is an historical collection
on human curiosities.

268
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,916
- Blockheads are skilled performers.
- Like magicians?

269
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,753
Like sword swallowers
who really do swallow swords.

270
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,318
And geeks are neither skilled nor curiosities.
They're merely unseemly.

271
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,229
- Not even attaining the level of gaffs.
- Gaffs?

272
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,635
Observe closely the dissimilarity
of the facial features.

273
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,188
Conjoined twins are always identical.

274
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,714
These gentlemen are phonies. Gaffs.

275
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,591
Sort of like the Fiji Mermaid?

276
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,159
<i>(chuckles)</i>

277
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,277
You're investigating
the Alligator Man's murder, yes?

278
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,069
I have something I believe
you might find of some interest.

279
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,031
What does this have to do with
the Glazebrook murders?

280
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,795
I've recently come into possession
of an authentic PT Barnum exhibit.

281
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,348
I don't show this display
to all my customers -

282
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,035
only those with the intellectual
curiosity to appreciate it.

283
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,350
Barnum billed it as a great unknown.

284
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,075
I must first ask of you two favours.

285
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,469
Tell no soul what you witness in here.

286
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,239
- And the second favour?
- An additional donation of five dollars.

287
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,995
<i>(buzzer)</i>

288
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,071

<i>(rustling)</i>

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,278
Does Agent Scully know
that you're under her crawlspace?

291
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,875
I was merely repairing
the plumbing on this unit.

292
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,794
I know what you're thinking, my friend,
but you are grossly mistaken.

293
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,715
Not being of so-called average height does
not mean I must get my thrills vicariously.

294
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:00,157
Not all women are attracted to
overly tall, lanky men such as yourself.

295
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,916
You'd be surprised how many women
find my size intriguingly alluring.

296
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,150
You'd be surprised how many men do, too.

297
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,919
Ach!

298
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,358
Oh, it's you.
Has Mr Nutt finished with the plumbing?

299
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:33,114
The blood samples matched but were both
O-positive. They went for further analysis.

300
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,589
I ran a background check
on Doctor Blockhead.

301
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,638
His real name is Jeffrey Swaim
and he wasn't born in Yemen.

302
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,757
He was born in Milwaukee.
He does not hold a doctorate.

303
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,278
I ended up running a bit of
a background check myself.

304
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,557
- On who?
- On an orphan...

305
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,633
...discovered in the wild forests
of Albania in 1943.

306
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,188
"Although adept at catching his own food...

307
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,192
...he could not speak,
save for a few savage grunts."

308
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,868
"Brought to this country, he was exhibited in
a locked cage owing to his feral ferocity...

309
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,039
...where he would terrify onlookers
by devouring chunks of raw meat."

310
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,031
"For reasons I could not ascertain,
he ran away from the circus...

311
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,830
...and spent a number of years roaming about,
taking on a number of nondescriptjobs."

312
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,637
"Eventually he wound up in Gibsonton,
where he began a career in law enforcement...

313
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,190
...and has spent the past
four terms serving as sheriff."

314
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,396
You're talking about Sheriff Hamilton?

315
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,914
Before becoming Sheriff Hamilton...

316
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,629
...James Hamilton was
Jim-Jim the Dog-Faced Boy.

318
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,159
You know, Scully, hypertrichosis
does not connote lycanthropy.

319
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,073
- What are you implying?
- We're being discriminatory.

320
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:46,439
Just because a man was once overly hairy
why suspect him of aberrant behaviour?

321
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,637
- Like assuming guilt based on skin colour?
- Yeah.

<i>(clears throat)</i>

00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,229
May I ask what you're doing?

324
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,431
We're exhuming...

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,790
...your potato.

326
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,075
May I ask why?

327
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,795
It's been documented that many serial killers
possess a fascination with police work...

328
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,236
...some of them even holding
positions on their local force.

329
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,313
So, surveillance of investigation
team members is often utilised as a...

330
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,994
We found out you used to be
a dog-faced boy.

331
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,913
Boy, look how skinny I was back then.

332
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,950
- So, that is you?
- Oh, sure.

333
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,508
I spent the first half of my life as Jim-Jim.

334
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,795
One day I noticed a bald spot on my head...

335
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,156
...and realised I was losing my hair
and my career as well!

336
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,277
Eventually all the hair went -
on top of my head anyways.

337
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,558
The rest of my body's still pretty hairy,
which is why I never go to the beach.

338
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,479
That doesn't quite explain the potato.

339
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,313
I got, uh... some warts on my hand.

340
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,349
That doesn't quite explain the potato.

341
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,389
To get rid of warts, you rub a sliced potato
on your hand and bury it under a full moon.

342
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,392
The investigation isn't
going too well, is it?

343
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,791
So tell me, Commodore.

344
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,919
Why are the weirdos the only ones
that pay their rent cheques in advance?

345
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,672
<i>(Commodore growls)</i>

346
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,791
I warn you, you tattooed cretin!

347
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,079
I have a licensed firearm and I am more
than eager for an opportunity to use it.

00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,232

351
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,955
I found him.

352
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,873
He's dead. He's dead.

353
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,352
<i>(sheriff)</i> Lanny says all the doors and
windows were locked from the inside.

354
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,431
Scully, come here.

355
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,111
He was like a brother to me.

356
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,996
I don't know if a contortionist could get
through that doggy door, but look at this.

357
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,791
<i>(Lanny yells)</i>

358
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,871
Lanny! Lanny!

359
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,075
Take it easy. You're gonna hurt yourself.

360
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,078
- So what?
- So you might hurt me in the process.

361
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:44,271
He gets this way sometimes.
I'll have to toss him in the drunk tank.

362
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,870
We'll take Jeffrey Swaim into custody.

363
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,871
Come on, Lanny. Let's go.

364
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,269
You know, Mulder, for a while...

365
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,989
...I was beginning to suspect this case
involved something a bit more...

366
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,071
Freakish?

367
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,830
You shouldn't complain about banality...

368
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,037
...when your main suspect
is the Human Blockhead.

369
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,475
<i>(knocking)</i>

370
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,278
It's open!

371
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,794
Mr Swaim? Federal agents. We're here to...

372
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,275
It's a variation of
an American Indian sun dance ritual.

373
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,230
I suspend myself by these hooks...

374
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,154
...and the pain becomes
so unbearable, I leave my body.

375
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,389
If people knew the true price of spirituality,
there'd be more atheists.

376
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,234
We're taking you into custody
to question you about some murders.

377
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,195
I don't answer till I talk to my lawyer.

378
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,352
- Who's your lawyer?
- I represent myself.

379
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,193
If you're uncooperative,
I'll have to handcuff you.

380
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,589
What gives you fascists
the right to do that?

381
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,309
- Did I not say we're federal agents?
- Did I not say I'm an escape artist?

382
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,951
Mulder, are you okay?

383
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,950
It's more comfortable than a futon.

384
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,756
Hey! Look what I caught.

385
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,955
Ouch!

What the hell?

389
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,391
No!

390
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,550
Nooo!

391
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,029
- Nooo!
- <i>(screeching)</i>

392
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,952
This has all the makings of those mistaken-
identity miscarriage-of-justice things...

393
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,156
...that prove so popular on <i>60 Minutes.</i>

394
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,032
- Is this yours?
- The Fifth Amendment says...

395
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,076
<i>(long, constant moan)</i>

396
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,831
- What is that?
- It's Lanny in the drunk tank.

397
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,514
He'll be all right once he sleeps it off.

398
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,558
No, I don't think
he's gonna sleep this one off.

399
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,470
There's been another attack.

400
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,790
How could anyone have gotten in there?

401
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,314
No one got in. But someone got out.

402
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,994
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not sure myself.

403
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,389
But we'll know more when we find Leonard.

404
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,359
- Leonard?
- Lanny's brother.

405
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,999
Oh, God, they extracted the twin.

406
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,719
No. The twin extracted itself.

407
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,872
- But it's an appendage.
- Yeah. Mulder...

408
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,273
This wound is identical to the other victim's -
with one exception. He's not bleeding.

409
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,668
If you're trying to tell me his twin can crawl
out of his body, you're as drunk as he is.

410
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,835
You said it yourself, Sheriff:
It's what's inside that counts.

411
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,233
I suspect that Lanny has an internal anomaly
that allows his conjoining twin to disjoin.

412
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,994
- But how? How...
- <i>(Lanny)</i> How?

413
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,396
How could I turn him in
without turning myself in?

414
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,200
Lanny, why does he attack other people?

415
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,553
I don't think he knows he's harming anyone.

416
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,471
He is merely seeking...

417
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,271
...another brother.

418
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,193
<i>(moans)</i>

419
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,794
Are you in pain, Lanny?

420
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,391
It hurts.

421
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,471
It hurts not to be wanted.

422
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,156
I don't know why he hates me so.

423
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,436
I've taken care of him for all of our lives.

424
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,188
Maybe that is the reason why.

425
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,077
How long can he survive
outside of your body?

426
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,151
Long enough...

427
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,108
...to understand that you cannot change
the way you were born.

428
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,596
Don't worry.

429
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,114
He'll come back.

430
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,191
He always does.

431
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,075
I'm still his only brother.

432
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,913
Sheriff, we're gonna need the paramedics.

433
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,836
Scully, you're the medical expert
and you say the twin can disengage.

434
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,480
But how mobile could such a thing be?

<i>(squelching)</i>

436
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,751
Too mobile.

437
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,149
So your twin can, uh...

438
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,598
And then...

439
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,474
What an act!

440
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,351
<i>(squawking)</i>

441
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,831
I'll cover the back.

<i>(barks)</i>

452
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,871
It's the manager's dog.

453
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,391
The trailer park.

454
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,275

00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,310
Uh...

<i>(stomach gurgles)</i>

459
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,109
Check out the area behind that trailer
and let me know what you find.

460
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,428
All right.

461
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,875
You're sure it was the twin you saw here?

462
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,951
Maybe it was the Fiji Mermaid...

463
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,998
...and he jumped back in the river
and swam back to Fiji.

464
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,071
Now you know how <i>I feel.

465
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,829
- You're takin' off?
- Are you kidding? With that on the loose?

466
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,913
They've been searching for it all day.
It can't have survived for this long.

467
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,037
It'll probably try to crawl
back up into its brother.

468
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:17,671
No, his brother Lanny died last night.
I performed the autopsy on him this morning.

469
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,354
So I guess it's true
you can never go home again!

470
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,476
His body wounds were nonfatal.

471
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,038
He died as a result
of advanced cirrhosis of the liver.

472
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,829
Oh, there's a moral to this story!
"Lay off the booze."

473
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,117
Well, his body possesses
some anatomical discrepancies.

474
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,751
Offshoots of the oesophagus and trachea
that almost seem umbilical in nature. I...

475
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,476
- I've never seen anything like it.
- And you never will again.

476
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,551
21st-century genetic engineering...

477
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,632
...will eradicate Siamese twins
and alligator people.

478
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,032
You'll even be hard-pressed to find
a slight overbite or a not-so-high cheekbone.

479
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,795
You see, I've seen the future
and the future looks... just like him.

480
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,758
Imagine! Living your whole life
looking like that.

481
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:04,397
That's why it's left to self-made freaks like
me and the Conundrum to remind people.

482
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,477
Remind people of what?

483
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,473
Nature abhors normality. It can't go
very long without creating a mutant.

484
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,676
- Do you know why?
- No. Why?

485
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,197
I don't either. It's a mystery.

486
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,352
Maybe some mysteries
are never meant to be solved.

487
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,675
- What's the matter with your friend?
- I don't know what his problem is.

488
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,116
- Maybe it's the Florida heat.
- Hope it's nothing serious.

489
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,751
Probably somethin' I ate.
