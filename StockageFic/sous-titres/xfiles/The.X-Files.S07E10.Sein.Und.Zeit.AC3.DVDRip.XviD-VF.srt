1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,267
Now I lay me down to sleep,

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:08,637
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep.

3
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:12,007
If I die before I wake,

4
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:15,377
I pray the Lord
my soul to take.

5
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:19,350
God bless Mommy,
God bless Daddy,

6
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,944
and Grandma
and Grandpa LaPierre,

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,923
and Grandma
and Grandpa Jason, and...

8
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:27,892
Okay, okay, Amber Lynn.
Bedtime. Come on.

9
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:32,557
You grab Mike, okay?
Hop in.

10
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,533
Let's get you cozy, cozy,
toasty, toasty.

11
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,332
Inside. Snug as a bug.

12
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,498
- Night-night, Lynnie.
- Night-night, Daddy.

13
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:45,166
- Night, Mommy.
- Night, love.

14
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,973
Bed lights out, Amber Lynn.

15
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,017
Good girl.
That's a good girl.

16
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,076
Stop right there!

17
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,815
- Weapon on the floor.
- This is great.

18
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:22,434
Where's this trial
I'm being put through?

19
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,909
Is this a test
of my love for you?

20
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,338
Billie?

21
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:32,851
- They are the ones that want me
to kill myself.

22
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,006
Aah!

23
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,250
Oh, sweet angel.

24
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,568
Billie! Amber Lynn!

25
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,896
Oh, God!

26
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:30,689
Amber Lynn LaPierre, that's right.

27
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:32,855
A federal investigation is underway.

28
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,861
The kidnapping in Sacramento,
California.

29
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:58,812
- Why are you here, Agent Mulder?
- I want this case.

30
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,018
I'm fairly certain I've got more
than enough competent agents in here.

31
00:06:02,094 --> 00:06:05,689
- Ooh, I can see that.
- This is a kidnapping, Agent Mulder.

32
00:06:05,764 --> 00:06:09,564
A little girl snatched from her bedroom.
Basic, missionary-style F.B.I. work.

33
00:06:09,634 --> 00:06:11,932
- It's not an X-File.
- I'm aware of the facts.

34
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:16,832
We're trying to rule out all
possibilities before we start
making any statements.

35
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:19,206
That's what I'm talking about,
ruling out other possibilities.

36
00:06:19,277 --> 00:06:21,370
I can't just give you the case.

37
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:24,040
I have to follow protocol.

38
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:27,677
Behavioral gets first crack,
then the people down at N.C.N.E.C.

39
00:06:27,753 --> 00:06:29,880
Two, three, four hours.

40
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:33,220
This case is gonna be a circus.
Every starstruck attorney in America...

41
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,725
is gonna want to represent
these people for free.

42
00:06:35,794 --> 00:06:39,059
If somebody doesn't ask
the right questions right now,
they may never get asked.

43
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:50,564
You've got till noon. Mulder...

44
00:06:54,146 --> 00:06:58,742
the agents in my office...
they have a pool going.

45
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:02,580
They think she's dead.

46
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:06,216
Don't bet on it.

47
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:26,470
Sir, can you tell us about...

48
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:28,740
Excuse me.
Have they found the girl?

49
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:31,146
Are there any new developments
in the case? Is she dead?

50
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:34,242
Are the parents suspects in
the disappearance of their daughter?

51
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:38,085
Sorry, no press
allowed inside.

52
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:40,954
Special Agent Fox Mulder,
F.B.I.

53
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:44,462
- I'd like to speak to
Mr. And Mrs. LaPierre if I may.
- My clients have nothing to say.

54
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:48,960
Uh, Harry Bring.
How can I help you?

55
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:54,196
Mr. Bring, your card says
"real estate law and conveyances."

56
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:56,365
Have you ever handled
a murder case?

57
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:59,808
- This isn't a murder case.
- Well, it might as well be...

58
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:02,574
once the facts about Amber Lynn's
disappearance get out.

59
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:08,244
My clients are not murderers,
and-and I resent any such accusation.

60
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,812
You know, if you really want to help
your clients, get them a real lawyer.

61
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,154
It's okay, Harry.

62
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:23,801
- Billie and I got nothin' to hide.

63
00:08:25,904 --> 00:08:28,338
Mr. And Mrs. LaPierre,
my name is Fox Mulder.

64
00:08:28,406 --> 00:08:31,569
I'm a special agent
with the F.B.I.

65
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:35,238
I have a lot of experience with crimes
like the one that took place here.

66
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:37,747
I know you've made
a statement to the police,

67
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:40,250
but I'd like to ask you
some questions about that.

68
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:43,776
I'd like you to answer in as
much detail as both you and your
lawyer are comfortable with.

69
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:46,824
I want to ask you
about the note you found.

70
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:50,328
Where did you find it?

71
00:08:50,395 --> 00:08:52,920
- In my daughter's bedroom.
- When?

72
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:55,364
When I went
to check on her.

73
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:59,597
- Do you know what time that was?
- 9:30, I think.

74
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:01,764
It was right about then.

75
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:07,108
- I was watching TV in here.
- What were you watching?

76
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:11,171
I never heard of it before.
It was good.

77
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:13,877
What about you,
Mrs. LaPierre?

78
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:22,855
- I was in bed already.
- Were you asleep?

79
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:25,396
Half.

80
00:09:25,463 --> 00:09:29,058
Is that Amber Lynn's bedroom
that I saw down the hallway there?

81
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:32,703
Yes.

82
00:09:32,771 --> 00:09:35,899
Do you always lock your doors at night,
even if you're home?

83
00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:39,076
Yes.

84
00:09:42,314 --> 00:09:45,010
You know most of your neighbors,
I bet, up and down the street.

85
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,745
- You're on good terms with them?
- Most of them, yes.

86
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:51,651
Can you think of anyone who
might've wanted to hurt Amber Lynn?

87
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:57,659
That's enough questions.
They've been very helpful,

88
00:09:57,729 --> 00:10:00,664
but I think you can see that these folks
have nothing whatsoever to hide.

89
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:06,336
Mr. And Mrs. LaPierre,
I want you to understand something,

90
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:10,272
because it's gonna get
very confusing from here on in.

91
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:13,743
But whatever else
the F.B.I. says or does,

92
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:16,713
they're gonna try their damnedest
to find your little girl.

93
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:20,114
- Okay.
- Thank you.

94
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:26,054
Agent Mulder?

95
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:30,424
Do you think they will...
find her?

96
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:35,866
Oh, I hope so.

97
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:40,631
Yeah. I really do.

98
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:15,900
It's open.

99
00:11:15,974 --> 00:11:18,772
Mulder?

100
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,711
Come on in.

101
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,011
- What are you doing?
- Thinkin'.

102
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,985
- About?
- Amber Lynn LaPierre.

103
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:36,824
- Mind if I turn on a light?
- Yeah. I do.

104
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:43,198
Skinner is royally pissed.

105
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:52,434
- At you.
- I'm sure he is.

106
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:55,036
He expected
a report at noon.

107
00:11:55,113 --> 00:11:58,549
He waited. And now he sent me
to find you to get it.

108
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:03,350
- I don't have a report.
- They had to move on the case.

109
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:07,152
The media got wind of the police
findings. They're gonna broadcast them.

110
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:10,058
The parents are being held
for further questioning.

111
00:12:10,128 --> 00:12:13,495
- They're not guilty, Scully.
- The facts would say otherwise.

112
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:15,533
There's no sign
of a break-in.

113
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,534
Both of the parents were at home
at the time the girl disappeared.

114
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:21,299
They lied about where
they found the note.

115
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,137
- Why?
- That's what I've been thinkin' about.

116
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:34,642
Is it the media,
orjust our own morbid fascination
with the killing of an innocent?

117
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:40,182
She's not dead, Scully.

118
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:51,730
- Mulder.
-  Fox, it's me.

119
00:12:51,803 --> 00:12:55,170
- Mom? Hi.
- I'm watching the news.

120
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,004
That little girl in California.
You're out there, aren't you?

121
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:02,110
Yes.

122
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,879
- I am. Are you okay, Mom?
- When are you coming back here?

123
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:10,183
Well, I'm not sure.
You know, I don't know.

124
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,855
- Call when you get back, Fox.
- Okay, I will.

125
00:13:14,926 --> 00:13:16,860
Um...

126
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:19,089
You take care,
Mom, okay?

127
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:33,038
From the note, we can
and have determined several facts.

128
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:36,547
There is a threat of physical violence,
but no demand for money or ransom.

129
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,913
The note is short and written
on a torn piece of paper,

130
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,147
suggesting haste
and little or no planning.

131
00:13:44,856 --> 00:13:49,020
The paper's the type used by dry
cleaners to protect laundered garments.

132
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,927
The torn piece that
the note was found on...

133
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:56,195
matches exactly a piece that was found
in the garbage at the LaPierre home.

134
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:59,828
The ink matches a felt-tip pen
that was also found in the garbage.

135
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:02,930
One set of prints were found on it...
Billie LaPierre's prints.

136
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,977
- Is it her handwriting?
That's gonna be difficult to prove,

137
00:14:06,044 --> 00:14:08,979
due to the felt-tip pen
and the quality of the paper,

138
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:12,107
which tends to cause bleeding,
makes the handwriting indistinct.

139
00:14:12,183 --> 00:14:15,619
It also looks like there's been
an attempt to disguise the writing.

140
00:14:16,888 --> 00:14:18,947
By using samples of
Mrs. LaPierre's handwriting,

141
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,925
we see dominant letter forms...
the "S" in "strangle,"

142
00:14:21,993 --> 00:14:24,086
"stray dog, "
here in "Santa Claus. "

143
00:14:24,162 --> 00:14:28,030
Matches up with
the "S"'s in "dollars"...

144
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:31,797
"seven"and "cents. "

145
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,805
- Enough to make a connection.
- But not an indictment.

146
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,200
Do you have information you'd like
to share with us, Agent Mulder?

147
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:42,371
Bud LaPierre says he'd
been watching television...

148
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:44,779
and had gotten up to go to bed
when he found Amber Lynn missing.

149
00:14:44,849 --> 00:14:46,942
But according to
the police report,

150
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:50,215
the TVset was still on when
the first officers arrived on the scene.

151
00:14:50,288 --> 00:14:53,416
By his own account, both mother
and father put Amber Lynn to bed...

152
00:14:53,491 --> 00:14:56,892
and were never more than 20 feet
from her room during the period
in which she was abducted.

153
00:14:56,961 --> 00:15:01,523
The LaPierres know all their
neighbors up and down the street,
are on good terms with them.

154
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:05,160
But no one saw a stranger
on a Friday...

155
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:09,502
at a fairly early hour
enter into a locked and lighted home...

156
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:11,701
and remove this
little girl undetected.

157
00:15:11,776 --> 00:15:14,472
- Husband's lying for his wife.
- I don't think so.

158
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:17,071
Why?

159
00:15:19,117 --> 00:15:23,315
Because that doesn't explain
what happened to this little girl.

160
00:15:51,816 --> 00:15:53,909
What are you doing, Mulder?

161
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:56,215
There's something in that abduction note
that I've seen before.

162
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:58,221
That's not what I mean.

163
00:15:58,289 --> 00:16:02,453
You're personalizing this case.
You're identifying with your sister.

164
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:07,362
My sister was taken by aliens.
Did I say anything about aliens?

165
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:11,027
There are a lot of good agents
up in Skinner's office who do
not have the patience for this.

166
00:16:11,102 --> 00:16:13,570
What did I do?
I provided a logical counterpoint.

167
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:17,699
- You told them that
they were wrong, Mulder.
- And they are.

168
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,141
Pocatello, Idaho, 1987.

169
00:16:22,313 --> 00:16:25,248
Look familiar?

170
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:52,867
Kathy Lee,
visitors are here.

171
00:16:52,943 --> 00:16:55,810
- Can you let them in, please?

172
00:17:01,752 --> 00:17:04,744
Hi, Ms. Tencate. My name is
Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully.

173
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,481
Can we have a seat?

174
00:17:10,127 --> 00:17:12,561
It's not the Ritz.

175
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:17,498
Um... we just have
a few questions.

176
00:17:17,568 --> 00:17:21,504
We've reviewed the facts of your case.
The facts seem to speak for themselves.

177
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:26,134
Your six-year-old son Dean
was taken from his bed while he slept.

178
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,941
A note was found threatening his life,
later determined to be written by you.

179
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:33,711
You plead innocent at trial,
but you were convicted...

180
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:36,810
and sentenced to 12 years, even though
your son's body was never found.

181
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:41,221
- Yes, that's right.
- Your story is that, uh,

182
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:46,787
on the night your son disappeared,
you had a vision of him dead.

183
00:17:46,864 --> 00:17:49,526
You thought it was your mind
playing tricks on you,

184
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,001
but when you got up to check on him,
he was missing from his bed.

185
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,595
- Is that accurate?
- Yes.

186
00:17:55,673 --> 00:17:58,073
Now, three years ago,
after seven years of incarceration,

187
00:17:58,142 --> 00:18:00,702
you changed your story and confessed
to the murder of your son...

188
00:18:00,778 --> 00:18:05,340
in a fit of insanity,
a psychotic break.

189
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,943
- Yes, that's right.
- Why did you do it?

190
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:15,192
I don't know.
I was full of rage.

191
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:21,996
I have a... copy of the note
that you wrote.

192
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:27,670
Do you mind
if I show it to you?

193
00:18:27,738 --> 00:18:31,834
Now, there's a phrase
down here at the bottom.

194
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:34,844
"No one shoots
at Santa Claus."

195
00:18:34,912 --> 00:18:37,403
Can you explain
what that means to me?

196
00:18:37,481 --> 00:18:40,075
Uh... It means that, uh,

197
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:45,680
when someone promises you something,
a gift, like Santa Claus,

198
00:18:45,756 --> 00:18:49,214
that no one would do anything
for fear of not getting the gift.

199
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,564
A little girl disappeared
from her bed three days ago.

200
00:18:56,634 --> 00:18:58,898
This is the note that was
left at that scene.

201
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:04,673
Can you take a look at that
and tell me what it says at the bottom?

202
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:11,247
Same thing.

203
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:13,783
Neither note makes
a specific demand.

204
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:17,514
In both cases, there is no evidence
of foul play or break-in.

205
00:19:17,588 --> 00:19:20,216
And, as in your son's case,
there is no body to be found.

206
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,589
- I told them where the body was.
- Yes, you did.

207
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,528
- But it wasn't where you
said it was gonna be.
- I can't explain it.

208
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:28,565
- I think you can.
- I can't!

209
00:19:30,668 --> 00:19:34,104
You can't explain it
because you didn't do anything.

210
00:19:39,276 --> 00:19:43,303
You didn't kill your son,
and you didn't bury him.

211
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,339
You're not guilty of anything other
than a lie, just like these people.

212
00:19:47,418 --> 00:19:50,148
The only reason you changed your story
was to get outta here.

213
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:53,054
Because you knew the parole board
might buy the story...

214
00:19:53,123 --> 00:19:55,557
of a psychotic break
and of your terrible remorse.

215
00:19:55,626 --> 00:20:00,325
But they would never, never let a woman
out ofjail who claimed her son
just disappeared out of thin air

216
00:20:00,397 --> 00:20:02,490
These people...

217
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:06,298
they need someone
to tell them it's okay,

218
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,463
someone to corroborate
their story.

219
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:13,937
- I'm not that person.
- They need your help.

220
00:20:28,993 --> 00:20:31,757
That was utterly
irresponsible, Mulder.

221
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:34,798
It was out of line and it was
without any basis in reality.

222
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:38,323
- You think that woman
could've killed her son?
- She was convicted in a court of law.

223
00:20:38,402 --> 00:20:42,998
So how do you explain those two notes,
written ten years apart,
could contain the same obscure phrase?

224
00:20:43,073 --> 00:20:46,167
I can't explain it, Mulder,
but you're doing exactly what I said.

225
00:20:46,243 --> 00:20:49,440
- You're personalizing this case.
- No. I'm gonna solve this case.

226
00:20:49,513 --> 00:20:51,708
- I am gonna solve it.
- How?

227
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:54,307
I'm gonna find those kids.

228
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:57,679
What if they're dead, Mulder?

229
00:20:59,423 --> 00:21:02,358
Don't go looking for something
you don't wanna find.

230
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:29,341
Guard? Guard, please,
can you get them back?

231
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:33,150
Guard?
I need to talk.

232
00:21:33,223 --> 00:21:37,182
This is Fox Mulder. Leave a message.
I'll try to get back to you.

233
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:41,992
Fox, it's your mother.

234
00:21:42,065 --> 00:21:47,002
I'd hoped you'd call upon your return,
but I haven't heard from you.
I'm sure you're busy.

235
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:52,508
There are so many emotions in me,
I wouldn't know where to start.

236
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,409
So much that I've left unsaid
for reasons I hope...

237
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,414
one day you'll understand.

238
00:22:09,492 --> 00:22:13,758
This is highly unusual.
I wanna know what you're doing here.

239
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,628
Something I want
your clients to see.

240
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,063
I wanna know
what it is first.

241
00:22:22,138 --> 00:22:25,733
It's about shootin' Santa Claus,
Mr. Bring. You're gonna wanna
see it too.

242
00:22:26,876 --> 00:22:28,867
I believe you
share a secret.

243
00:22:32,015 --> 00:22:34,006
I'm, uh...

244
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:37,542
I'm doing this because I feel
that it's the right thing to do,

245
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,953
and because I know what
you're going through.

246
00:22:41,024 --> 00:22:43,959
I wouldn't want to happen
to you what happened to me.

247
00:22:46,196 --> 00:22:48,892
I just want to tell you
that your little girl is okay.

248
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,996
And I know you're afraid
of the truth, because I...

249
00:22:53,069 --> 00:22:56,527
I saw things that
I was afraid of too.

250
00:22:56,606 --> 00:22:58,972
And I can't explain all of it,
except to say...

251
00:22:59,042 --> 00:23:01,977
that I don't remember...

252
00:23:02,045 --> 00:23:07,108
ever... thinking those words that
I wrote, let alone writing them.

253
00:23:09,252 --> 00:23:12,779
It was like they wrote
themselves using my hand.

254
00:23:12,856 --> 00:23:16,952
But what I know...

255
00:23:17,027 --> 00:23:21,088
for sure, because I feel it
in my heart,

256
00:23:21,164 --> 00:23:24,793
is that my son is safe
and protected...

257
00:23:24,868 --> 00:23:26,961
and in a better place.

258
00:23:31,775 --> 00:23:33,800
Rumors and suspicions aside,

259
00:23:33,877 --> 00:23:35,845
the parents of
Amber Lynn LaPierre...

260
00:23:35,912 --> 00:23:38,403
were released today for lack
of evidence against them,

261
00:23:38,481 --> 00:23:42,781
and after giving a new statement to the
Sacramento police, which insiders say...

262
00:23:42,852 --> 00:23:47,152
has authorities still baffled and
confused, recounting a detailed story...

263
00:23:47,223 --> 00:23:51,592
that claims supernatural forces were at
work when their daughter was abducted.

264
00:23:51,661 --> 00:23:56,098
The LaPierres, seen here returning
to their home, declined comment.

265
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:59,192
Federal investigation
of the case will continue,

266
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:04,969
but will no longer focus on
the LaPierres as primary suspects.

267
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:09,671
We, uh, we will intensify
our search for Amber Lynn,

268
00:24:09,746 --> 00:24:14,274
and we remain hopeful
of her eventual safe return.

269
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:22,482
"Intensify our search" where?
The Twilight Zone?

270
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,153
- I have a corroborating witness.
- In state prison.

271
00:24:25,228 --> 00:24:27,992
There's a material connection
between these two women.

272
00:24:28,064 --> 00:24:30,692
The only connection,
Agent Mulder, is you.

273
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:33,736
I've got people busting
their butts on this thing,

274
00:24:33,803 --> 00:24:35,737
putting together hard evidence,
real evidence,

275
00:24:35,805 --> 00:24:38,774
while you're out gathering Grimm's
Fairy Tales from convicted murderers.

276
00:24:38,842 --> 00:24:43,438
Doesn't make sense.
It's incomprehensible in
any kind of a real-world way.

277
00:24:43,513 --> 00:24:45,913
I deal in the real world,
Agent Mulder.

278
00:24:47,951 --> 00:24:50,044
You begged onto this case
as part of the solution.

279
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,419
All you've done is hand our
only suspects the Twinkie defense.

280
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,459
- Sir.
- What? What is it, Agent Scully?

281
00:24:56,526 --> 00:24:59,222
- I need to have a word with Agent Mulder.
- It can wait.

282
00:24:59,295 --> 00:25:02,753
- No, it can't, sir.
- What is it, Scully?

283
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:06,568
Mulder, your mom's dead.

284
00:26:12,468 --> 00:26:15,232
- Mulder?
- In here.

285
00:26:15,304 --> 00:26:18,171
- What is it?
- Diazapan.

286
00:26:18,241 --> 00:26:21,802
She used them to sleep.

287
00:26:21,878 --> 00:26:24,779
- Was there a note?
- No.

288
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:27,315
She called when I was in California.
She wanted to talk,

289
00:26:27,383 --> 00:26:30,181
but, uh, I never
called her back.

290
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:32,153
Oh, Mulder...

291
00:26:33,322 --> 00:26:36,519
I didn't...
Why would she do this?

292
00:26:38,327 --> 00:26:40,852
It just doesn't
make any sense.

293
00:26:43,132 --> 00:26:47,330
- We never truly know why.
- No. She wouldn't kill herself.

294
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:51,005
Why are these
pictures gone?

295
00:26:51,074 --> 00:26:54,737
There were photos here.
There were photos of my sister and I.

296
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:58,110
This is all she had left of us,
and they're missing. Why...

297
00:27:04,287 --> 00:27:08,781
She saw me on the news. She wanted to
talk about the missing girl, Amber Lynn.

298
00:27:08,858 --> 00:27:11,759
She wanted to tell me
something about her.

299
00:27:11,828 --> 00:27:13,921
Maybe she couldn't
tell me over the phone,

300
00:27:13,996 --> 00:27:16,396
'cause she was afraid that they would
do something like this to her.

301
00:27:16,466 --> 00:27:19,458
- Who?
- Whoever took my sister.

302
00:27:19,535 --> 00:27:23,062
Look at this place.
I mean, it's like it's all staged.

303
00:27:23,139 --> 00:27:25,972
The pills, the oven, the tape.
It's like a bad movie script.

304
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:28,476
They would've come here,
and they would've threatened her.

305
00:27:28,544 --> 00:27:31,638
She would be upset. They would have
to sedate her. I would look for a, uh...

306
00:27:31,714 --> 00:27:36,151
a needle-puncture mark or something else
in her system besides these pills.

307
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:39,052
No, Mulder.
Please don't ask me to do this.

308
00:27:39,122 --> 00:27:43,081
- Scully, who else can I ask?
- An autopsy, Mulder?

309
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:45,992
It's one thing on a stranger, but you're
my friend and she's your mother.

310
00:27:46,062 --> 00:27:48,929
I know. But if you don't do it,
I might never know the truth.

311
00:28:12,522 --> 00:28:14,456
You've seen things.

312
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:18,953
I need to understand them.

313
00:28:22,865 --> 00:28:24,958
Something's happened to you?

314
00:28:26,202 --> 00:28:28,670
My mother's dead.

315
00:28:28,738 --> 00:28:30,672
You know why.

316
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:37,009
Look, I can help you.
I can talk to the parole board for you.

317
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:39,206
But right now,
I need you to help me.

318
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:44,015
- I don't understand what you want.
- I'm not here by accident.

319
00:28:45,755 --> 00:28:48,815
My sister was
taken away from me...

320
00:28:48,891 --> 00:28:52,884
when she was eight years old,
like your son was taken away from you.

321
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:57,296
- Where's your sister now?
- I don't know.

322
00:28:57,366 --> 00:29:02,394
- Your mother knew, didn't she?
- Why do you ask that?

323
00:29:02,471 --> 00:29:07,204
- She was trying to tell you.
- Tell me what?

324
00:29:07,276 --> 00:29:10,006
- She'd seen them.
- Who?

325
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:12,411
The walk-ins.

326
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:16,850
Old souls looking
for new homes.

327
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,853
Your sister's among them.

328
00:29:22,258 --> 00:29:25,716
- You can see them?
- Yes.

329
00:29:25,795 --> 00:29:30,232
But sometimes it's very difficult
because they live in the starlight.

330
00:29:34,737 --> 00:29:38,229
- Is my sister dead?
- They took her...

331
00:29:38,307 --> 00:29:42,368
to protect her soul from the great harm
it would've suffered in her life,

332
00:29:42,445 --> 00:29:45,005
just like they did
my little boy.

333
00:29:46,716 --> 00:29:48,809
Where do they take them?

334
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:52,017
Your boy?

335
00:29:52,088 --> 00:29:56,855
- This little girl, Amber Lynn LaPierre?
- I don't know.

336
00:29:56,926 --> 00:29:59,224
But they're okay.

337
00:30:00,463 --> 00:30:02,727
I'm sure your sister's
there too.

338
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:13,271
Come on!
I want to see Santa!

339
00:30:15,845 --> 00:30:17,779
Yes!

340
00:30:22,618 --> 00:30:25,280
- That one's fat.
- That's not Rudolph!

341
00:30:28,891 --> 00:30:31,917
- This one is dead! He's dead.
- He's not! He's not!

342
00:30:31,994 --> 00:30:33,996
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

343
00:30:34,129 --> 00:30:37,428
Had a very shiny nose
Like a lightbulb

344
00:30:37,499 --> 00:30:39,399
- You can't sing it!
- Yes, I could!

345
00:30:39,468 --> 00:30:41,800
- No, you can't!
- I could!

346
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,929
Hey, buddy.

347
00:30:44,006 --> 00:30:48,272
- The kids wanna see Santa.
What about it?
- He's just flying in.

348
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,807
- We're gonna see Santa!
- Santa!

349
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:39,491
Fox, it's your mother.

350
00:31:39,561 --> 00:31:44,965
I'd hoped you call upon your return,
but I haven't heard from you.
I'm sure you're busy.

351
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:49,367
There are so many emotions in me,
I wouldn't know where to start.

352
00:31:50,672 --> 00:31:52,902
So much that I've left
unsaid for reasons...

353
00:31:52,974 --> 00:31:55,306
I hope one day
you'll understand.

354
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:03,847
There are so many emotions in me,
I wouldn't know where to start.

355
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,046
So much that I've left
unsaid for reasons...

356
00:32:06,121 --> 00:32:08,646
I hope one day
you'll understand.

357
00:32:16,164 --> 00:32:18,724
I'm glad you're here.

358
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,598
My mother was trying
to tell me something.

359
00:32:22,904 --> 00:32:25,168
- Think I've figured it out.

360
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:30,837
Something about my sister that
she was never able to tell me.

361
00:32:30,912 --> 00:32:32,937
So much that I've left
unsaid for reasons...

362
00:32:33,014 --> 00:32:35,949
I hope one day
you'll understand.

363
00:32:36,017 --> 00:32:39,077
She knew what I'd find with
this case out in California.

364
00:32:39,154 --> 00:32:42,487
- How could she know that?
- Child disappearing without a trace,

365
00:32:42,557 --> 00:32:45,924
without evidence,
in defiance of all logical explanation?

366
00:32:45,994 --> 00:32:50,454
She knew because of what's driven me,
what I've always believed.

367
00:32:50,532 --> 00:32:52,523
Mulder...

368
00:32:52,601 --> 00:32:55,434
Scully, these...
these parents who have lost...

369
00:32:56,905 --> 00:33:00,136
who've lost their children,
they've had visions...

370
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:02,506
of their sons
and daughters...

371
00:33:02,577 --> 00:33:04,841
in scenarios that
never happened, but...

372
00:33:04,913 --> 00:33:08,713
which they describe in notes that
came through as automatic writing,

373
00:33:08,783 --> 00:33:14,278
and words that came
through them psychically...
from old souls protecting the children.

374
00:33:15,657 --> 00:33:19,718
My mother must've written
a note like that herself...

375
00:33:20,996 --> 00:33:25,126
describing the scenario of my...

376
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,102
sister's disappearance,
of her abduction by aliens.

377
00:33:31,206 --> 00:33:33,470
Don't you see, Scully?
It never happened.

378
00:33:35,477 --> 00:33:37,968
All these visions that
I've had have just been...

379
00:33:38,046 --> 00:33:41,243
they've been to help me cope,
to help me deal with the loss, but...

380
00:33:41,316 --> 00:33:45,013
I've been looking for my sister
in the wrong place.

381
00:33:45,086 --> 00:33:48,783
That's... what my mother
was trying to tell me.

382
00:33:48,857 --> 00:33:51,291
That's what she was
trying to warn me about.

383
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:53,452
That's why they killed her.

384
00:33:55,163 --> 00:33:57,256
Your mother killed herself,
Mulder.

385
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:01,793
I conducted the autopsy.

386
00:34:03,305 --> 00:34:05,830
She was dying of
an incurable disease...

387
00:34:07,542 --> 00:34:12,002
an untreatable and horribly disfiguring
disease called Paget's carcinoma.

388
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:16,850
She knew it.
There were doctors' records.

389
00:34:20,188 --> 00:34:22,122
She didn't wanna live.

390
00:34:44,746 --> 00:34:46,839
She was trying
to tell me something!

391
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,053
She was...

392
00:34:57,092 --> 00:35:00,061
She was trying to
tell you to stop...

393
00:35:01,997 --> 00:35:04,227
to stop looking
for your sister.

394
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:07,666
She was just trying
to take away your pain.

395
00:36:10,799 --> 00:36:13,529
- Hi.
- Hi.

396
00:36:13,601 --> 00:36:17,230
- How's he doing?
- It's been a hard night for him.

397
00:36:19,841 --> 00:36:22,435
Billie LaPierre's asking for him.
She's got something to say.

398
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:25,741
- She'll only talk to Mulder.
- It's not a good...

399
00:36:25,814 --> 00:36:27,748
What is it?

400
00:36:27,816 --> 00:36:31,445
This case has heated up.
I've booked two flights for us.

401
00:36:38,727 --> 00:36:40,820
Then you better book three.

402
00:36:47,235 --> 00:36:49,169
Honey, wake up.

403
00:36:51,005 --> 00:36:53,599
- He's here.
- Hm?

404
00:36:53,675 --> 00:36:56,041
Come in, Agent Mulder.

405
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:05,786
It's okay.
She's here to help.

406
00:37:08,189 --> 00:37:10,350
What happened here, Billie?

407
00:37:12,594 --> 00:37:16,360
I saw my daughter
right in this room...

408
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:21,696
standing right there.

409
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:25,103
I swear to God,
she was right over there...

410
00:37:25,173 --> 00:37:29,109
in the pajamas
her grandma gave her...

411
00:37:29,177 --> 00:37:31,111
saying something to me.

412
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:36,276
- What was she saying?
- I don't know.

413
00:37:36,351 --> 00:37:40,185
Her lips were moving,
but I couldn't hear.

414
00:37:43,024 --> 00:37:44,958
I thought...

415
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:49,730
I thought she
was saying "74."

416
00:37:49,798 --> 00:37:54,963
74? The number 74?
Does that mean anything to you?

417
00:37:59,741 --> 00:38:03,336
74 mean anything to you,
Mr. LaPierre?

418
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:16,423
Let's go home.

419
00:38:16,491 --> 00:38:18,686
Mulder, we just got here.

420
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,491
We're not gonna...
find these people's daughter alive.

421
00:38:22,564 --> 00:38:25,032
- How do you know that?
- What we're hearing, it's...

422
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:28,591
the delusional talk of people
that don't want to accept the truth.

423
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,230
- You think they know what
happened to their child?
- Maybe, maybe not.

424
00:38:31,306 --> 00:38:34,833
But you can't see a ghost
and still hope to find her alive.

425
00:38:34,909 --> 00:38:37,139
Both things
can't be true.

426
00:38:37,212 --> 00:38:40,670
If this little girl's spirit
really did appear to her mother,

427
00:38:40,748 --> 00:38:43,012
then there's probably
only one explanation.

428
00:38:43,084 --> 00:38:47,020
You think their
daughter's dead.

429
00:38:47,088 --> 00:38:50,615
- Well, what about the handwritten note?
- I don't know what that means.

430
00:38:50,692 --> 00:38:53,684
I don't know what is the truth
and what isn't anymore.

431
00:38:53,761 --> 00:38:57,595
I'm way too close to this case
to make any kind of sound judgment.

432
00:38:57,665 --> 00:39:01,692
In fact, I would like to ask for you
to let me off this case, please,

433
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:04,567
and I'd like to take
some time off.

434
00:39:41,709 --> 00:39:43,836
What is it?

435
00:39:47,515 --> 00:39:50,075
- Santa Claus.
- What?

436
00:39:50,151 --> 00:39:52,517
Stop. Turn around.

437
00:41:14,302 --> 00:41:16,770
Some of these tapes
go back to the '60s.

438
00:41:31,986 --> 00:41:34,216
I think I know what
we're gonna find here.

439
00:41:34,288 --> 00:41:36,916
It's what my mother was
afraid of... my sister.

440
00:41:44,198 --> 00:41:47,190
It's Amber Lynn LaPierre.

441
00:41:50,505 --> 00:41:54,908
This tape is dated two days
before her disappearance.

442
00:42:10,058 --> 00:42:11,491
Hey!

443
00:42:39,821 --> 00:42:42,119
- Stop!

444
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,793
Keep your hands up!

445
00:42:51,265 --> 00:42:54,894
- What's your name?
- Ed Truelove.

446
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:57,870
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

447
00:42:57,939 --> 00:43:00,271
If you give up the right
to remain silent, anything you say...

448
00:43:00,341 --> 00:43:02,605
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

449
00:43:02,677 --> 00:43:04,770
You have the right
to speak with an attorney...

450
00:43:04,846 --> 00:43:07,280
and to have your attorney
present during questioning.

451
00:43:07,348 --> 00:43:10,283
If you so desire and cannot afford one...

452
00:43:17,024 --> 00:43:19,686
Scully.
