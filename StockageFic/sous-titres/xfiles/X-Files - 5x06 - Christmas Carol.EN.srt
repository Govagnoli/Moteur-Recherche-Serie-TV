HOW ARE YOU GONNA
GET AROUND ?

167
00:19:14,301 --> 00:19:16,553
I'LL RENT A CAR.

168
00:19:17,905 --> 00:19:19,840
ALL RIGHT.  LUNCH.

169
00:19:21,742 --> 00:19:23,243
WE'LL HOLD YOU TO THAT.

170
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:36,473
AGENT SCULLY.
IT'S BEEN, WHAT, FOUR HOURS ?

171
00:19:36,473 --> 00:19:38,942
I WAS GETTING WORRIED.

172
00:19:38,942 --> 00:19:42,179
I'D LIKE TO ORDER AN AUTOPSY
ON ROBERTA SIM.

173
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:44,414
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY
SHE WAS MURDERED.

174
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:51,388
WHAT, YOU GOT
ANOTHER PHONE CALL ?

175
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:54,591
I THINK IT MAY HAVE
BEEN THE HUSBAND.

176
00:19:55,943 --> 00:19:58,278
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT IDEA ?
YOU WANT COFFEE ?

177
00:19:58,278 --> 00:20:01,982
NO, THANKS.
HE'S GOT
AN IRONCLAD ALIBI.

178
00:20:01,982 --> 00:20:05,852
MR. SIM WAS
AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE
WITH HIS DAUGHTER.

179
00:20:05,852 --> 00:20:08,238
HE WAS THERE ALL MORNING.
I CHECKED.

180
00:20:08,238 --> 00:20:12,125
I TOOK ANOTHER LOOK
AT THE POLICE PHOTOS
THIS MORNING.

181
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:15,629
THERE WERE
NO HESITATION CUTS
ON ROBERTA SIM'S WRISTS.

182
00:20:15,629 --> 00:20:18,131
SUICIDE VICTIMS SELDOM
MAKE THE FATAL CUT
ON THE FIRST TRY.

183
00:20:18,131 --> 00:20:20,600
SELDOM, BUT NOT ALWAYS.
IS THAT ALL YOU GOT ?

184
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:22,619
NO.

185
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,455
WHY WAS THE PHONE
OFF THE HOOK WHEN YOU GOT
TO THE SIMS' HOUSE ?

186
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:28,292
THE WIFE TOOK IT OFF.

187
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:30,127
I'M GUESSING SHE DIDN'T
WANT TO BE INTERRUPTED.

188
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:32,462
YOUR INCIDENT REPORT SAYS
THE HUSBAND CALLED THE POLICE...

189
00:20:32,963 --> 00:20:35,832
- AFTER HE DISCOVERED
  HIS WIFE DEAD.
- YEAH.

190
00:20:35,832 --> 00:20:39,186
BUT IF THE PHONE WAS
OFF THE HOOK WHEN YOU ARRIVED,
HOW DID HE CALL YOU ?

191
00:20:39,186 --> 00:20:42,456
DID HE FIND THE PHONE
OFF THE HOOK, CALL YOU...

192
00:20:42,456 --> 00:20:46,026
AND THEN HAVE THE PRESENCE
OF MIND TO RETURN IT
TO THE WAY HE FOUND IT ?

193
00:20:46,026 --> 00:20:49,296
- DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU ?
- WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING ?

194
00:20:49,296 --> 00:20:54,067
I'M SUGGESTING THAT
THERE ARE QUESTIONS WHICH
BEG FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

195
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:55,819
ORDER AN AUTOPSY.

196
00:20:58,004 --> 00:21:00,924
THE STOMACH CONTENTS
APPEAR TO INCLUDE COFFEE,

197
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:03,927
WHOLE WHEAT TOAST
AND CANTALOUPE.

198
00:21:07,931 --> 00:21:09,933
NO MEDICINE TABLETS.

199
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:12,936
EMPTY SAMPLE PACKETS
OF DORITRIPTAN SUCCINATE
WERE FOUND,

200
00:21:12,936 --> 00:21:15,272
BUT I SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT
THERE WERE ANY PILLS INGESTED.

201
00:21:15,272 --> 00:21:19,843
WELL, OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE.
DORITRIPTAN SHOWED UP
ON THE TOX SCREEN.

202
00:21:19,843 --> 00:21:22,129
THEN WHY DIDN'T IT SHOW UP
IN HER STOMACH ?

203
00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:25,198
IT WAS ABSORBED
INTO THE BLOODSTREAM.

204
00:21:25,198 --> 00:21:29,086
I DON'T BELIEVE THE ABSORPTION
WOULD BE THAT COMPLETE,
NOT THAT CLOSE TO HER DEATH.

205
00:21:29,586 --> 00:21:33,473
THEN HOW DID THE DORITRIPTAN
GET IN HER SYSTEM, MS. SCULLY ?

206
00:21:33,473 --> 00:21:36,543
- A NEEDLE PUNCTURE ?
- ON THE HEEL OF HER RIGHT FOOT.

207
00:21:36,543 --> 00:21:40,046
EXTREMELY TINY AND EASY TO MISS.
IT WAS MEANT TO BE OVERLOOKED.

208
00:21:41,948 --> 00:21:44,417
I BELIEVE THAT THIS WOMAN
WAS INJECTED,

209
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:47,788
ANESTHETIZED
SO SHE WOULDN'T FIGHT BACK,
THEN HER SUICIDE WAS STAGED.

210
00:21:47,788 --> 00:21:51,591
- WHAT DO YOU THINK ?
- IT'S A POSSIBILITY.

211
00:21:52,092 --> 00:21:54,377
THEN AGAIN,
IT'S POSSIBLE THIS WOMAN
SIMPLY STEPPED ON A TACK,

212
00:21:54,377 --> 00:21:57,597
AND THE REST IS
BLUE-SKY CONJECTURE.

213
00:21:57,597 --> 00:22:00,100
I'D SAY IT JUSTIFIES
OPENING A MURDER INVESTIGATION.

214
00:22:13,313 --> 00:22:16,817
THIS IS YOUR DOING, ISN'T IT ?
YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE DECENCY...

215
00:22:16,817 --> 00:22:20,320
TO LEAVE ME
AND MY DAUGHTER ALONE.
MR. SIM, PLEASE.

216
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,324
NOW YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO CALM DOWN AND LET US
DO OUR BUSINESS, OKAY ?

217
00:22:24,825 --> 00:22:26,326
WHERE IS YOUR DAUGHTER
RIGHT NOW ?

218
00:22:26,326 --> 00:22:27,811
WHY ?

219
00:22:31,932 --> 00:22:34,818
SHE'S AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE.
THANK GOD, SHE'S NOT HERE
TO SEE THIS.

220
00:22:34,818 --> 00:22:38,205
DETECTIVE, THIS WAS
IN THE TRASH OUT BACK.

221
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:46,997
YOU GOT AN EXPLANATION
FOR THIS ?

222
00:22:46,997 --> 00:22:50,150
YES.  MY DAUGHTER HAS
A SEVERE FORM OF ANEMIA.

223
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,603
SHE REQUIRES
DAILY INJECTIONS.

224
00:22:53,603 --> 00:22:56,389
WE'LL CHECK THAT OUT.

225
00:22:56,389 --> 00:23:00,177
I WANT YOU TO ANALYZE THIS,
GET A P.C.R. ON THE BLOOD.

226
00:23:00,177 --> 00:23:02,679
WE NEED TO IDENTIFY
WHOSE IT IS.
OKAY.

227
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,080
DANA,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ?

228
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:32,736
IT'S 2:00 IN THE MORNING.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL DAY ?

229
00:24:32,736 --> 00:24:35,605
WE WERE EXPECTING YOU
FOR LUNCH.

230
00:24:37,607 --> 00:24:41,444
MOM... SIT DOWN.

231
00:24:49,469 --> 00:24:53,340
THE WOMAN WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE
HAS AN ADOPTED DAUGHTER.

232
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,775
A THREE-YEAR-OLD NAMED EMILY.

233
00:24:55,775 --> 00:24:58,144
I GOT A SAMPLE
OF EMILY'S BLOOD,

234
00:24:58,144 --> 00:25:01,614
AND I HAD THE LAB
RUN A TEST ON HER DNA.

235
00:25:01,614 --> 00:25:04,334
IT'S CALLED A P.C.R. TEST.

236
00:25:04,334 --> 00:25:07,370
THIS IS EMILY'S.

237
00:25:09,873 --> 00:25:13,460
THIS... IS MELISSA'S...

238
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:17,814
WHICH WE RAN
DURING HER MURDER INVESTIGATION.

239
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:20,950
THEY MATCH.

240
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,636
WHAT DOES IT MEAN,
"THEY MATCH" ?

241
00:25:23,636 --> 00:25:26,573
IT MEANS...

242
00:25:26,573 --> 00:25:29,576
THAT THIS LITTLE GIRL, EMILY,

243
00:25:31,578 --> 00:25:33,413
IS MELISSA'S DAUGHTER.

244
00:25:47,443 --> 00:25:48,945
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

245
00:25:48,945 --> 00:25:51,914
YOU CAN'T DENY THAT THERE'S
A REMARKABLE RESEMBLANCE.

246
00:25:51,914 --> 00:25:56,252
MELISSA WAS THREE YEARS OLD
WHEN THIS PICTURE WAS TAKEN.
SHE WAS PRACTICALLY A BABY.

247
00:25:56,252 --> 00:25:58,871
ALL KIDS CAN LOOK THE SAME
AT THAT AGE.

248
00:25:58,871 --> 00:26:03,426
MOM, IT'S UNCANNY.
EMILY LOOKS EXACTLY
LIKE MELISSA.

249
00:26:03,426 --> 00:26:06,295
THAT'S WHY I ORDERED
THE P.C.R. TEST;

250
00:26:06,295 --> 00:26:09,082
BECAUSE HER FACE MAY CHANGE,
BUT HER DNA CAN'T.

251
00:26:09,082 --> 00:26:10,566
AND THAT TEST IS ACCURATE ?

252
00:26:10,566 --> 00:26:14,620
THERE IS A 60% CHANCE THAT
MELISSA IS EMILY'S MOTHER.

253
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:18,391
I'M GOING TO ORDER
A MORE COMPREHENSIVE TEST:
AN R.F.L.P.

254
00:26:18,391 --> 00:26:20,793
IT'LL TAKE A COUPLE OF DAYS,
THEN WE'LL BE SURE.

255
00:26:20,793 --> 00:26:23,679
I AM ALREADY SURE YOUR SISTER
DID NOT HAVE A BABY.
SHE WOULD HAVE TOLD ME.

256
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,065
MOM...

257
00:26:27,066 --> 00:26:30,069
REMEMBER
ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO,
MELISSA TOOK OFF ?

258
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:32,071
SHE TRAVELED UP AND DOWN
THE WEST COAST.

259
00:26:32,071 --> 00:26:33,873
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE
SHE WAS HALF THE TIME.

260
00:26:33,873 --> 00:26:36,492
YOU'RE SAYING SHE WAS PREGNANT,
AND SHE DIDN'T WANT US TO KNOW ?

261
00:26:36,492 --> 00:26:41,714
THAT WAS 1994.
EMILY WAS BORN
THAT NOVEMBER.

262
00:26:41,714 --> 00:26:45,218
SHE COULD HAVE GIVEN HER UP
FOR ADOPTION AND NONE OF US
WOULD HAVE EVER KNOWN.

263
00:26:45,218 --> 00:26:48,671
DANA, LISTEN TO ME.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH.

264
00:26:48,671 --> 00:26:53,559
MOM, THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ANYTHING I'M GOING THROUGH.

265
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:55,311
IT HAS HAPPENED TO ME.

266
00:26:55,311 --> 00:27:00,049
WHEN YOUR FATHER DIED,
IT WAS A LONG TIME
BEFORE HE LEFT ME.

267
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:03,019
I SAW HIM IN MY DREAMS.

268
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:07,023
THE PHONE WOULD RING
AND, JUST FOR A MOMENT,
I WAS SURE IT WAS HIS VOICE.

269
00:27:07,023 --> 00:27:09,525
AND YOU'RE DOING THE SAME THING
WITH MELISSA.

270
00:27:09,525 --> 00:27:11,527
YOU'RE SEEING HER
IN THIS CHILD.

271
00:27:11,527 --> 00:27:14,030
BUT THAT DOES NOT MAKE THIS
CHILD MY GRANDDAUGHTER.

272
00:27:15,982 --> 00:27:19,485
WE'RE STILL CONNECTED
TO THEM, DANA,

273
00:27:19,485 --> 00:27:21,988
EVEN AFTER THEY'RE GONE.

274
00:27:30,947 --> 00:27:32,865
LOOK AT ALL THE PRESENTS.

275
00:27:32,865 --> 00:27:35,868
[ Melissa ]
DANA, QUIET.
THEY'LL HEAR US.

276
00:27:43,142 --> 00:27:46,696
THIS ONE'S FOR ME.
YOU WISH.
THAT'S FOR BILLY, YOU DOPE.

277
00:27:48,998 --> 00:27:52,285
THIS HAS GOT TO BE IT !
IT'S GOTTA BE
"HOTEL CALIFORNIA."

278
00:27:52,285 --> 00:27:55,071
SHH, YOU'LL WAKE EVERYBODY.

279
00:27:55,071 --> 00:27:59,842
- I WONDER WHAT THIS IS ?
- I DON'T KNOW,
  BUT I GOT ONE TOO.

280
00:27:59,842 --> 00:28:04,013
[ Mom ]
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHAKE IT,
DANA.  YOU CAN OPEN THOSE NOW.

281
00:28:19,011 --> 00:28:20,813
THANKS, MOM.

282
00:28:20,813 --> 00:28:24,000
YOUR GRANDMOTHER GAVE ME A CROSS
JUST LIKE THAT WHEN I WAS
ABOUT YOUR AGE.

283
00:28:32,892 --> 00:28:34,894
IT'S PRETTY.

284
00:28:34,894 --> 00:28:39,382
IT MEANS GOD IS WITH YOU.
HE'LL WATCH OVER YOU
WHEREVER YOU GO.

285
00:28:48,441 --> 00:28:50,226
[ Knocking ]

286
00:28:50,226 --> 00:28:52,612
DANA ?

287
00:28:52,612 --> 00:28:54,897
HI.

288
00:28:54,897 --> 00:28:57,200
SORRY.
THERE'S A DETECTIVE
HERE TO SEE YOU.

289
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,002
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

290
00:29:04,974 --> 00:29:07,977
I KNOW IT'S EARLY.
NOT A PROBLEM.

291
00:29:07,977 --> 00:29:10,763
INTERESTING TIDBIT
ON MR. SIM.
WHAT ?

292
00:29:10,763 --> 00:29:14,433
BANK DEPOSITS,
LARGE ONES--
$30,000 A POP.

293
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:18,671
THREE IN THE LAST 18 MONTHS.
ALL THE CHECKS HAVE BEEN
MADE OUT TO HIS WIFE.

294
00:29:18,671 --> 00:29:21,823
THE LAST ONE WAS DEPOSITED
YESTERDAY, APRES-MORT.

295
00:29:21,823 --> 00:29:25,076
WHERE'D THE CHECKS COME FROM ?
A PHARMACEUTICAL FIRM
IN CHULA VISTA.

296
00:29:30,548 --> 00:29:34,302
DR. CALDERON ?
YES ?

297
00:29:34,302 --> 00:29:36,170
I'M AGENT DANA SCULLY
WITH THE F.B.I.,

298
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:38,506
AND THIS IS DETECTIVE KRESGE
WITH THE SAN DIEGO POLICE
DEPARTMENT.

299
00:29:38,506 --> 00:29:42,226
- WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU ?
- WE'RE INVESTIGATING THE DEATH
  OF ROBERTA SIM.

300
00:29:43,678 --> 00:29:46,147
- WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN ?
- YOU KNEW MRS. SIM ?

301
00:29:46,147 --> 00:29:48,015
HER DAUGHTER, EMILY,
IS A PATIENT HERE
AT OUR CLINIC.

302
00:29:48,015 --> 00:29:49,851
WHAT WERE YOU
TREATING HER FOR ?

303
00:29:49,851 --> 00:29:52,236
SHE'S A SUBJECT IN ONE
OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS.

304
00:29:52,236 --> 00:29:55,740
WE'RE DEVELOPING GENE THERAPIES
FOR SEVERAL BLOOD DISORDERS.

305
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,460
EMILY SUFFERS FROM A RARE TYPE
OF AUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA.

306
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,779
SHE'S A VERY SICK LITTLE GIRL.

307
00:30:01,779 --> 00:30:05,683
WHAT'S HER PROGNOSIS ?
[ Calderon ]
I REALLY COULDN'T SAY.

308
00:30:05,683 --> 00:30:08,085
THESE ARE ONGOING
DOUBLE-BLIND TRIALS.

309
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:10,087
IT COULD BE YEARS
BEFORE WE HAVE ANY RESULTS.

310
00:30:10,087 --> 00:30:12,990
YOU'VE BEEN
PAYING THE SIM FAMILY
SOME COMPENSATION FOR THIS ?

311
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,743
EMILY'S A VERY SPECIAL CASE.
WE WERE LUCKY TO FIND HER.

312
00:30:15,743 --> 00:30:19,380
- HOW DID YOU FIND HER ?
- HER FATHER BROUGHT HER
  TO OUR ATTENTION.

313
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,216
THEN WHY ARE THE CHECKS
MADE OUT TO HER MOTHER ?

314
00:30:22,717 --> 00:30:24,719
HOW SHALL I PUT THIS ?

315
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:28,222
THESE PAYMENTS ARE A GESTURE
OF GOODWILL TOWARDS MRS. SIM.

316
00:30:28,222 --> 00:30:31,576
SHE WASN'T COMPLETELY CONVINCED
THAT OUR EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT
WAS THE WAY TO GO.

317
00:30:32,076 --> 00:30:33,578
SHE WANTED TO PULL EMILY
FROM THE PROGRAM ?

318
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:36,781
SHE FILED THE PAPERWORK,
BUT HER HUSBAND
LATER WITHDREW IT.

319
00:30:36,781 --> 00:30:40,067
DR. CALDERON,
DID YOU EVER PRESCRIBE...

320
00:30:40,067 --> 00:30:43,271
DORITRIPTAN INJECTIONS
TO EMILY DURING THE COURSE
OF HER TREATMENT ?

321
00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:45,539
NO, I PRESCRIBED THEM
FOR THE HUSBAND...

322

MELISSA IS NOT EMILY'S MOTHER,

484
00:44:17,132 --> 00:44:21,303
BUT THAT THEY FOUND
STRIKING GENETIC SIMILARITIES
BETWEEN EMILY AND MELISSA.

485
00:44:21,803 --> 00:44:24,806
SO MANY
THAT THEY RAN A TEST...

486
00:44:24,806 --> 00:44:27,676
AGAINST ANOTHER SAMPLE
THAT THEY ALREADY HAD.

487
00:44:27,676 --> 00:44:31,380
- WHAT SAMPLE ?
- WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO SAY ?

488
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,499
ACCORDING TO THIS...

489
00:44:39,004 --> 00:44:42,007
I AM EMILY'S MOTHER.

490
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:29,221
[ Child ]
I MADE THIS !
