<i>(woman) Once, when she was a girl,</i>
<i>a very little girl...</i>

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,035
<i>... Dana was in the woods.</i>

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,393
<i>It was autumn. She had always been</i>
<i>a tomboy, unlike her sister Melissa.</i>

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,873
<i>For her birthday, Dana's brothers gave her</i>
<i>a BB gun and were showing her how to use it.</i>

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,310
<i>Their father had told them</i>
<i>only to shoot at cans.</i>

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,513
<i>But in a patch of grass</i>
<i>Bill Junior found a garter snake.</i>

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,230
<i>And the boys began shooting.</i>

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,798
<i>Wanting to fit in with her brothers,</i>
<i>Dana also shot at the snake.</i>

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,758
<i>It squirmed wildly, fighting for life...</i>

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,960
<i>... but as the boys continued to shoot,</i>
<i>the snake began to bleed.</i>

11
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,514
<i>When she realised what she had done...</i>

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,597
<i>... Dana began to cry with irrevocable guilt.</i>

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,392
<i>Through her tears, she was saying that</i>
<i>something was missing from the snake.</i>

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,515
<i>She had taken something</i>
<i>that was not hers to take.</i>

15
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,318
<i>Although afraid of snakes,</i>
<i>Dana held the animal...</i>

16
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,995
<i>... as if sheer human will could keep it alive.</i>

17
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,638
<i>The snake, its blood on her hands, died.</i>
<i>Nothing she could do would bring it back.</i>

18
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,954
<i>(Mulder)</i> It's too soon, Mrs Scully.

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,995
We can't give up.

20
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,471
That day in the woods, I felt for my daughter.

21
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,275
But at this moment...

22
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,551

Sir... Sir, you can't go in there!

36
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,788
Who brought her here?
How did she get here?

37
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,871
- Would you...
- How did she get here!

38
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,758
Ms Scully was in this condition
when I arrived.

39
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,389
- If you step outside, Dr Daly...
- Is that Daly? Are you Dr Daly?

40
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,630
- What the hell is going on?
- Settle down...

41
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,838
Was it paramedics, FBI, military?
Answer me right now!

42
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,512
You saying she just appeared?!
Who did this to her?!

43
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,989
- Sir...
- I wanna see her admission forms!

44
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,036
I wanna see what tests were done!

45
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,432
If you're with them, if you're hiding anything,
I swear I will do anything!

46
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,115
Whatever it takes,
I'll find out what they did to her!

47
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,319
Dana is listed in critical condition. Comatose.

48
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,632
There is unawareness
of self or environment.

49
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,350
No evidence of language comprehension
or voluntary responses to external stimuli.

50
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,077
My apologies, but no one here can determine
how Dana arrived at the hospital...

51
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,152
...or how she was attended to
in such a critical condition.

52
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,796
Um...

53
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,113
Because of the absence of Dana's recent
medical history, I'm at a loss for a prognosis.

54
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,113
I can't determine with certainty
how long she's been in this state.

55
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,236
You haven't said why she's like this.

56
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,635
We just don't know, Mrs Scully. There are no
signs of injuries, traumatic or non-traumatic.

57
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,315
I can't find signs of
degenerative or metabolic disorders.

58
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,871
- We have conducted every test possible.
- I'd like her examined for trace evidence.

59
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,869
She's been bathed and cleaned
since her admittance.

60
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,714
Also there is a situation
which I don't know if you're aware of.

61
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,238
The FBI has notified us of
the terms of Dana's living will.

62
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,355
- What is it? What did she say?
- Well, Dana is a doctor.

63
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,194
Her criteria for terminating
life support is quite specific.

64
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,512
She states that if her
Glasgow Outcome Scale lists her...

65
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,194
She doesn't wanna live in this condition.

66
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,234
You signed the will as her witness.

67
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,271
I've been told not to call you Fox.

68
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,951
By who?

69
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,555
Dana. Just now.

70
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,836
Dana talked to you just now?
If she'd talked, the EEG would've moved.

71
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,915
Her soul is here.

72
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,757
Hi, Mom.

73
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,273
I'm glad you could come, Melissa.

74
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,794
You're Scully's sister?

75
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,671
Dana's choosing whether...

76
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,470
...whether to remain or move on.

77
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,271
You can feel her.

78
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,557

79
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,669
<i>(Mulder) She's not here.</i>

80
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:07,198
<i>(Melissa)</i> Your anger... your fear is blocking
any positive emotions she needs to feel.

81
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,917
I need to do more than
just wave my hands in the air.

82
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,391
<i>(woman)</i> May I help you?

83
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,151

84
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,674
Frohike?

85
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,190
Hey, Mulder! This is weird.

86
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,270
- Good work sneaking out these charts.
- Tucked 'em in my pants.

87
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,396
There's plenty of room down there.

88
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,234
You look down, Mulder.
You're welcome to come over on Saturday.

89
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,995
We're hoppin' on the Internet
to nit-pick inaccuracies of <i>Earth 2.</i>

90
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,914
- I'm doing my laundry.
- The chart shows abnormal protein chains.

91
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,037
The amino acid sequence
is in a combination I've never seen.

92
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,271
I downloaded Scully's data
to the newest Lone Gunman.

93
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,751
- He goes by the name "The Thinker".
- <i>(Byers)</i> This guy's a hacking genius.

94
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,868
What?

95
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,999
He reports the protein chains
are the by-products of branched DNA.

96
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,197
- Branched DNA?
- The cutting edge of genetic engineering.

97
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,158
Biological equivalent of a silicon microchip.

98
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,438
Way beyond cutting edge.
This is technology 50 years down the line.

99
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,398
- What's it used for?
- Could be a tracking system.

100
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,678
- Developmental stages of a marker.
- You mean a hi-tech identity card?

101
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,198
Or something as insidious as grafting
a human to something... inhuman.

102
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,389
Good theories, but all for naught.

103
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,392
This branched DNA is inactive.
It's waste product.

104
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,679
Whoever experimented on Scully is finished.
Now it's just a biological poison.

105
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,951
Will she live?

106
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,159
Um...

107
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,357
Her immune system has been decimated.

108
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,788
And, uh... I doubt even a healthy
human body has the ability to fight this.

109
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,429
Mulder, there's nothing you can do.

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,113

00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,795
<i>Dana, honey? I know you can hear me.</i>
<i>This is Nurse Owens.</i>

00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,994
<i>I'm here to take care of you, sweetheart.</i>

113
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,039
<i>Watch over you. Help you find the way home.</i>

114
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,192
I know you're far away from home tonight...

115
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,669
...and that where you are is peaceful.

116
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,751
It would be nice to stay.

117
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:03,437
But, Dana, you must leave here
only when it's time.

118
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,270
I'll be here when you need me, dear.

119
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,030

You wanna see what it takes
to find the truth, Agent Mulder?

169
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,794
You wanna know the things I know?

170
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,510
I'll attend to this.

171
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,436
<i>(Dr Daly)</i> Discontinuing the respirator
does not necessarily mean ending her life.

172
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,391
Karen Ann Quinlan lived for nine years
after cessation of mechanical ventilation.

173
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,072
I do believe, however, this is not the case
with your daughter, Mrs Scully.

174
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,918
My guess is that she's been like this since
her disappearance, and she will not improve.

175
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,037
Is she below the criteria
established in her will?

176
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,478
It's possible branched DNA
can be treated with designer antibiotics.

177
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,395
I don't know where you got this diagnosis,
but you are in no position to continue...

178
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,598
You've never provided an answer as to
why she's here or what's wrong with her.

179
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,513
- We must study her.
- She's not a piece of evidence.

180
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,353
She's here because of
unnatural circumstances.

181
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,556
She's dying.

182
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,029
That's perfectly natural.

183
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,157
We hide people
because we don't wanna look at death.

184
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,836
We have machines prolong a life
that should... that should end.

185
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,154
That's a much more unnatural circumstance
than any cause of her death.

186
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,629
That's very politically correct.

187
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,749
That's very human.

188
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,071
I love her.

189
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,315
And this is right.

190
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,358
Dana... has made our decision.

191
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,031
Fox.

192
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,117
You and Dana had a friendship
built on respect.

193
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,472
Now, in the last year,
I have lost my husband...

194
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,119
...and God knows
I don't wanna lose my baby girl.

195
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,833
But, like you, I have always respected her.

196
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,876
Fox, this is a moment for the family.

197
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,794
But you can join us if you want.

198
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,629
Read it. It's all there.

199
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,878
If you're having trouble sitting on Mulder,
Assistant Director Skinner...

200
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,235
...I'm sure you know we'd have no trouble.

201
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,958
Uh-uh.

202
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,392
THANK YOU FOR NOT SMOKING

203
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,351
<i>(knocking)</i>

204
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,431
Yeah, come in.

205
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,831
Sit down.

206
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,310
I called you because of rumours
about an incident at the hospital.

207
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,752
Is this about the tooth
found in the cafeteria Jell-O?

208
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,471
The rumour has it
you were involved in the laundry room?

209
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,994
- No, sir.
- A man was executed.

210
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,072
- I was with Scully.
- Traces of her blood were found.

211
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,951
- May I see the police report?
- There is no report or body. You know that!

212
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,271
Since I am unfamiliar with the incident,
how would I know?

213
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,635
- Knock it off!
- How does it feel?

214
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,118
Constant denial of everything,
questions answered with a question.

215
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,671
- I wanna know what happened, dammit!
- Him! That's what happened.

216
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,718
Cancer Man is responsible
for what happened to Scully.

217
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,268
- How do you know that?
- It's a rumour.

218
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,794
- Who is he?
- It's not your...

219
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,952
You can have my badge, the X-Files.
Just tell me where he is.

220
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,516
And then what? He sleeps with the fishes?

221
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,030
We're not the Mafia, Mulder.
We work for the Department of Justice.

222
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,236
<i>That's</i> what I want.

223
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,235
Agent Scully was a fine officer.

224
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,992
More than that, I liked her. I respected her.

225
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,872
We all know the field we play in
and what can happen in a game.

226
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,909
If you were unprepared for all the potentials,
then you shouldn't step on the field.

227
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,156
What if I...
I knew the potential consequences...

228
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,231
...but I... I never told her?

229
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,914
Then you're as much to blame
for her condition as... the Cancer Man.

230
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,391
Hello, Starbuck.

231
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,111
It's Ahab.

232
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,478
People would say to me...

233
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,874
..."Life is short."

234
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,953
"Kids, they grow up fast.
Before you know it, it's over."

235
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,349
I never listened.

236
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,319
To me, life went at a proper pace.

237
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,471
There were many rewards.

238
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,389
Until the moment that... I knew...

239
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,596
...I understood that...

240
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,311
...I would never see you again.

241
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,470
My little girl.

242
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,990
Then my life felt as if it had been
the length of one breath.

243
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,351
One heartbeat.

244
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:56,153
I never knew how much I loved
my daughter until I could never tell her.

245
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,349
At that moment, I'd have traded every medal,
every commendation, every promotion...

246
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,432
...for just one more second with you.

247
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,555
We'll be together again, Starbuck.

248
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,952
But not now.

249
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,632
Soon.

250
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,675
Dana?

251
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,752
I know death is at arm's reach tonight.

252
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,469
But, Dana, your time is not over.

253
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,557
You know, Fox... Sorry, Mulder.

254
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,715
You could spend your life finding everyone
responsible and it still won't bring her back.

255
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,115
Whoever did this to her
has an equal horror coming to them.

256
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,036
Including myself?

257
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,908
Pardon me. Sir, do you have
change for the cigarette machine?

258
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,791
No. Sorry, I don't.

259
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,995
What do you mean, yourself?

260
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,518
There's a pack already here. Morleys.

261
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,152
Not my brand.

262
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,715
900 WEST GEORGIA STREET

263
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,111
<i>(shouting on TV)</i>

264
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,917
<i>(man on TV)</i>
<i>Cigarette, Frank? How about a smoke?</i>

265
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,197
<i>(creaking)</i>

266
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,111
Sit down!

267
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,795
- How'd you find me?
- Shut up!

268
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,512
Tonight I ask questions and you answer,
you son of a bitch!

269
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,918
Don't try and threaten me, Mulder.
I've watched presidents die.

270
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,791
Why her?

271
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,678
Why her and not me?

272
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,231
Answer me!

273
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,311
I like you.

274
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,790
I like her, too.
That's why she was returned to you.

275
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,396
You should be the one to die.

276
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,118
Why?

277
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,829
Look at me. No wife, no family.

278
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,795
Some power.

279
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,395
I'm in the game because
I believe what I'm doing is right.

280
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,430
Right?

281
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,511
Who are you to decide what's right?

282
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,471
Who are <i>you?</i>

283
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,917
If people were to know of the things
that I know, it would all fall apart.

284
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,392
I told Skinner you shot the man
in the hospital, but I didn't believe it.

285
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,230
And here you are with a gun to my head.

286
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,834
I have more respect for you, Mulder.
You're becoming a player.

287
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,679
You can kill me now,
but you'll never know the truth.

288
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,395
And that's why I'll win.

289
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,113
Don't worry. This'll be our secret.

290
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,628
We wouldn't want others to... start rumours.

291
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,231
<i>(machine whirring)</i>

292
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,314
To Assistant Director Walter S Skinner:

293
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,712
Please accept my resignation
from the FBI, effective immediately.

294
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,471
I WANT TO BELIEVE

295
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,870
When I started out,
this room was where they kept the copier.

296
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,872
At least back then
it wasn'tjust wasted space.

297
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,677
<i>(ripping)</i>

298
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,871
It's unacceptable.

299
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:22,198
I know you feel responsible for Agent Scully,
but I won't accept defeat as self-punishment.

300
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:27,151
All the forensics, the field investigations,
the eyewitness accounts...

301
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,231
...to still know nothing.

302
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,915
To lose myself...

303
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,991
...and Scully.

304
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,831
I hate what I've become.

305
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,719
When I was 18, I... uh... I went to Vietnam.

306
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:58,400
I wasn't drafted, Mulder. I... I enlisted in
the Marine Corps the day of my 18th birthday.

307
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,271
I did it on a blind faith.

308
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,151
I did it because I believed it was
the right thing to do. Maybe I still do.

309
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,513
Three months into my tour...

310
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,196
...a ten-year-old North Vietnamese boy
walked into camp, covered with grenades.

311
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,711
And I, uh...

312
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,476
I blew his head off
from a distance of ten yards.

313
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:30,751
I lost my faith. Not in my country
or in myself, but in everything.

314
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,838
There was just no point
to anything any more.

315
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,909
One night, on patrol, we were, uh... caught.

316
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,231
And everyone... everyone fell.

317
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,431
I mean everyone.

318
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,031
I looked down at my body...

319
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,631
...from outside of it.

320
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,509
I didn't recognise it at first. I watched the VC
strip my uniform, take my weapon.

321
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,796
And I remained in this thickjungle.

322
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,394
Peaceful...

323
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,471
...unafraid...

324
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,513
...watching my... my dead friends...

325
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,431
...watching myself.

326
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,991
In the morning the corpsmen put me in
a body bag until... I guess they found a pulse.

327
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,874
I awoke in a Saigon hospital two weeks later.

328
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,996
I'm afraid to look any further
beyond that experience.

329
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,631
You?

330
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,431
You are not.

331
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,468
Your resignation is unacceptable.

332
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,275
You...

333
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,429
<i>You</i> gave me Cancer Man's location.

334
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,434
You put your life in danger.

335
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,631
Agent Mulder,
every life, every day, is in danger.

336
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,391
That's just life.

337
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,670
Your plane ticket.

338
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,716
- But we barely know each other.
- I can't tell you why she was taken.

339
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,077
It's too close to me.
I'm giving you the men who took her.

340
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,519
- How?
- They believe you'll be out of town.

341
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,271
They believe you have information
about Scully in your desk in your apartment.

342
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,148
At 8.17 tonight they'll search your apartment.

343
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,073
They will be armed. You will be waiting.

344
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,392
- Waiting?
- To defend yourself with terminal intensity.

345
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,552
It's the only way, Mulder.
The law will not punish these people.

346
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,591
After tonight, we cannot
make contact for several weeks.

347
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,638
<i>(knocking)</i>

348
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,431
Mulder.

349
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,832
Sorry.

350
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,390
I came by. You weren't answering,
your machine wasn't on.

351
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,191
Can I come in?

352
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,836
For a second?

353
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,552
- Why is it so dark?
- Because the lights aren't on.

354
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,397
OK.

355
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,076
I just came from the hospital.

356
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,869
Dr Daly says... she's weakening.

357
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,314
It could be any time, so I figured
you'd wanna come down and see her.

358
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,595
Well, I can't.

359
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:43,549
- Well, I'd think that you would.
- Yeah, well, I would. I can't. Not right now.

360
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,431
Listen.

361
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,393
I don't have to be psychic
to see that you're in a very dark place.

362
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,914
Much darker than where my sister is.

363
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,120
Willingly walking deeper into darkness
cannot help her at all. Only the light will...

364
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,830
Enough with the harmonic convergence crap!
You're not saying anything to me.

365
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,473
Why don't you just drop
your cynicism, paranoia and defeat?

366
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,519
Just because it's positive and good
doesn't make it silly or trite.

367
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,469
Why is it easier for you to try to get even,
than just expressing to her how you feel?

368
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,752
I expect more from you. Dana expects more.

369
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,556
Even if it doesn't bring her back,
at least she'll know.

370
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,031
And so will you.

371
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,991
I feel, Scully, that...

372
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,833
...you believe you're not ready to go.

373
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,392
And you've always had
the strength of your beliefs.

374
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,675
I don't know if my being here...

375
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,639
...will help bring you back.

376
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,349
But I'm here.

377

Let me check the chart.

380
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,915
No, there doesn't seem to be any
significant changes since you were last here.

381
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,071
Call Dr Daly. Now!

382
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,069
This is ICU. Find Dr Daly, stat.

385
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,271
I'm here.

386
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,591
Hello, Fox.

387
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,355
Not Fox. Mulder.

388
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,311
How are you feeling?

389
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,310
Mulder, I don't remember anything.

390
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,470
After Duane Barry...

391
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,551
It doesn't... it doesn't matter.

392
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,715
I... brought you a present.

393
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,955
<i>Superstars of the Super Bowls.</i>

394
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,909
I knew there was a reason to live.

395
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,475
Now you wanna get some rest. I...

396
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,353
...just came by to see
how you're doing. Say hi.

397
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,796
Mulder?

398
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,870
I had the strength of your beliefs.

399
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,871
I was holding this for you.

<i>(door opens)</i>

401
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,156
Can I see Nurse Owens?
I've got something I'd like her to have.

402
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,591
Nurse who?

403
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,037
Owens.

404
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,554
Short, with straight, light-brown hair.

405
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,909
She watched over me in Intensive Care
and I'd like to thank her.

406
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,994
Dana, I've worked here for ten years
and there's no Nurse Owens at this hospital.
