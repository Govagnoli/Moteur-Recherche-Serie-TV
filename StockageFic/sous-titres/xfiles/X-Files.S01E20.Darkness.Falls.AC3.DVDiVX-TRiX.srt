1
00:00:03,016 --> 00:00:05,314
Man #1 : You're supposed to be
in charge here, Perkins.

2
00:00:05,385 --> 00:00:06,875
Man #2:
I am in charge.

3
00:00:06,953 --> 00:00:09,945
Man #1 : These men want answers.
Theywant to know whatyour plan is.

4
00:00:10,023 --> 00:00:11,957
This thing could kill us all.

5
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:14,960
Man #2: We should have left
two days ago. No one would listen to me.

6
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:17,895
Man #1 : Nobody knew what it was
two days ago. Nobody knows now.

7
00:00:17,964 --> 00:00:19,397
Somebody has to go for help.

8
00:00:19,466 --> 00:00:21,957
What are the rest ofus
supposed to do?

9
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:23,161
Wait for help?

10
00:00:23,236 --> 00:00:24,669
Someone has to chance it...

11
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:26,000
and hike out.

12
00:00:26,073 --> 00:00:30,009
That person might not make
the road before nightfall.

13
00:00:30,077 --> 00:00:31,305
Then what?

14
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:32,969
I saywe run for it.

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,479
Split up,
take our chances.

16
00:00:34,548 --> 00:00:36,038
It's suicide, Dyer.

17
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,116
Fine.

18
00:00:38,218 --> 00:00:39,480
You stay here.

19
00:00:39,553 --> 00:00:41,544
Tell us how it turns out.

20
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:24,887
(Panting)

21
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:27,431
(Grunting)

22
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:30,493
(Labored Breathing)

23
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:37,841
I think it's broken.

24
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:39,674
You got to get up.

25
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,838
I can't make it.

26
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:46,679
(Groaning)

27
00:01:46,753 --> 00:01:48,186
We got to keep moving.

28
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:49,449
(Grunting)

29
00:01:49,523 --> 00:01:51,514
We're not going to make it.

30
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:55,119
(Distant Humming)

31
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:58,224
(Humming Growing Louder)

32
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:07,029
(Dyer Screaming)

33
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,615
Take a good look, Scully.

34
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:00,091
What am I looking at?

35
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,390
30 loggers working
a clear-cutting contract...

36
00:03:02,462 --> 00:03:03,895
in Washington State--

37
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:05,226
rugged, manly men...

38
00:03:05,298 --> 00:03:07,357
in the full bloom
oftheir manhood.

39
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:09,129
What am I looking for?

40
00:03:09,202 --> 00:03:13,036
Anything strange, unexplainable,
unlikely, boyfriend--

41
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:14,664
I don't know.

42
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:15,901
I give up, Mulder.

43
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:18,809
Funny. That's what
the Federal Forest Service...

44
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,107
has done as well.

45
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,772
Why? What happened to them?

46
00:03:21,882 --> 00:03:23,509
In a word, theyvanished.

47
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:25,244
Or so it would appear.

48
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:28,855
This is Doug Spinney
and Steven Teague.

49
00:03:28,955 --> 00:03:30,786
They call themselves
"monkeywrenchers."

50
00:03:30,857 --> 00:03:33,189
They drive spikes into trees...

51
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,751
sabotage logging equipment,
and make life miserable...

52
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:38,093
for lumberjacks
and lumber mills.

53
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:41,258
Ecoterrorists--
militant environmentalists.

54
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:42,665
Right. Two weeks ago...

55
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:44,670
the loggers radioed a message...

56
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:47,639
that Spinney and Teague
had gone on a spree...

57
00:03:47,707 --> 00:03:50,904
sabotaging equipment,
causing general mischief.

58
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:51,966
One week later...

59
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:54,070
all radio communication
was cut off.

60
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:55,580
Do they know why?

61
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:57,650
No. The lumber company...

62
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:00,777
asked the Federal Forest Service
to look into it.

63
00:04:00,887 --> 00:04:04,254
Two officials went in last week.
No one has heard from them.

64
00:04:04,324 --> 00:04:06,258
It appears as if
these monkeywrenchers...

65
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:07,953
are doing more than
mischiefmaking.

66
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:11,020
That's what the lumber company
and forest service are accusing.

67
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:13,122
They've asked the FBI
to investigate.

68
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,759
I had to pull strings
to get the case.

69
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:17,268
An ecoterrorism case?

70
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:19,202
Do I dare askwhy?

71
00:04:19,272 --> 00:04:23,402
In 1 934, long before anyone knew
what an ecoterrorist was...

72
00:04:23,476 --> 00:04:24,773
a WPA crew...

73
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:27,870
working that same area
vanished without a trace.

74
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:31,281
None ofthose men was ever found
or heard from again.

75
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:33,818
And you suspect what, Bigfoot?

76
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:35,218
Not likely.

77
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:38,189
That's a lot offannel
to be choking down...

78
00:04:38,258 --> 00:04:39,885
even for Bigfoot.

79
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,088
Come on. It will be
a nice trip to the forest.

80
00:05:09,856 --> 00:05:14,953
Hi. Fox Mulder, Dana Scully.
We're with the FBl.

81
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:16,791
Larry Moore,
Federal Forest Service.

82
00:05:16,863 --> 00:05:19,423
You can putyour gear
in the truck.

83
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:22,925
Must be pretty rugged
where we're going.

84
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:24,470
Yeah.

85
00:05:24,537 --> 00:05:26,937
Is that a bullet hole
in yourwindshield?

86
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:28,668
.22 caliber.

87
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:30,073
Somebody shot atyou?

88
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:32,703
There's not much
to hunt around here...

89
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:34,542
with that ammo
except Freddies.

90
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:35,615
" Freddies"?

91
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:37,683
Employees of
the Federal Forest Service.

92
00:05:37,784 --> 00:05:39,752
It's what ecoterrorists call us.

93
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:42,617
Is that whoyou think
shot atyou?

94
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:45,624
Let me get this
out ofthe way.

95
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:48,559
I have no quarrel
with ecoterrorists in principle.

96
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:50,619
I'm as concerned
for this forest...

97
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:52,597
and the environment as anybody.

98
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,600
It's their methods
I can't condone.

99
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:57,136
Doyou think
they'd kill a man?

100
00:05:57,203 --> 00:05:59,797
There's 30 men up there
unaccounted for...

101
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:01,773
each with survival experience.

102
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:03,866
Something happened to them.

103
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:07,645
Sorry I'm late.

104
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:10,205
I was down talking
to Bob Perkins' wife.

105
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:12,284
He's one ofour missing loggers.

106
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:13,647
Hey, Larry.

107
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,779
Steve Humphreys,
head ofsecurity...

108
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:16,947
for Schiff-lmmergut
Lumber.

109
00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:18,046
Mulder. Scully.

110
00:06:18,158 --> 00:06:20,456
We've got a four-hour drive
ahead ofus--

111
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:22,518
Plenty oftime
to get acquainted.

112
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:23,926
Get the impression...

113
00:06:23,997 --> 00:06:25,988
we've walked into
the middle ofa war...

114
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:27,590
that's already started?

115
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:38,233
Why do these men...

116
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:40,472
work so far up
in the wilderness?

117
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:41,809
That's where the trees are.

118
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:43,576
You're kidding, right?

119
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:45,514
No. Environmentalists
have made sure...

120
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:47,677
that all the land here
is untouchable.

121
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:50,278
We take our timber
where we can get it.

122
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,086
Even then, we plant saplings
for every tree we take.

123
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,093
So why do ecoterrorists
targetyou?

124
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:57,686
Tree huggers
are like the boys...

125
00:06:57,764 --> 00:07:00,562
who went up to Canada
during the Vietnam War.

126
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:03,295
They're cowardly,
and so are their tactics.

127
00:07:04,504 --> 00:07:05,772
Damn it.

128
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:07,873
Homemade tire spike.

129
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:09,909
Clear through the sidewall.

130
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:10,976
It's unfixable.

131
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:12,044
You got a spare?

132
00:07:12,145 --> 00:07:13,669
Humphreys:
Right tire's history too.

133
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:16,906
Monkeywrenchers call it
a caltrop.

134
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:19,315
Roads back here
are littered with them.

135
00:07:19,385 --> 00:07:20,750
Indiscriminate terrorism.

136
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,310
Can you imagine somebody...

137
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:24,652
spiking the roads
ofWashington, D.C.?

138
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:26,783
How much sympathy
would they get?

139
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,328
So how are we going
to get to the camp?

140
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:31,420
We're going to have to hike.

141
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:29,577
Anybody here?

142
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:37,525
Someone forgot
to clean their plate.

143
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:40,532
Scully: Looks like
they left in a hurry too.

144
00:08:49,242 --> 00:08:51,176
They forgot to pack.

145
00:08:57,784 --> 00:08:58,751
Find anything?

146
00:08:58,852 --> 00:08:59,841
Party favors.

147
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,853
Vehicles have all been
monkeywrenched.

148
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:03,252
Power generator's busted.

149
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:05,689
Somebody really turned
this place upside down.

150
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:08,454
Whoever did it didn't want
the fact broadcast, either.

151
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:21,000
Radiators are all full ofrice.

152
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:23,405
Looks like sugar or sand
in all the crankcases.

153
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:25,477
They really did a number here.

154
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:28,308
The sun's going down
in an hour and a half.

155
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:30,508
Better look around
before it gets dark.

156
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,813
I'll see ifl can get
that generatorworking.

157
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:34,877
You were right
about one thing.

158
00:09:34,954 --> 00:09:36,046
What's that?

159
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:38,147
Definitelywasn't Bigfoot.

160
00:09:59,145 --> 00:10:00,612
Look at that.

161
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,705
Scully:
What is it?

162
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:06,742
Moore:
It looks like a hive.

163
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:09,253
Maybe a cocoon ofsome kind.

164
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:10,584
Made bywhat?

165
00:10:10,657 --> 00:10:11,646
I don't know.

166
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:13,589
I've never seen
anything like it.

167
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:25,034
Got it.

168
00:10:25,104 --> 00:10:26,264
Can you cut it down?

169
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:29,575
Yeah, I think so.

170
00:10:39,953 --> 00:10:41,284
You all right, Scully?

171
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:09,307
Scully:
Oh, God.

172
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:20,318
It feels, uh...

173
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:22,860
it feels desiccated,
hard and dry...

174
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:24,954
almost preserved.

175
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:26,362
Like it's been embalmed.

176
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:29,196
No, more like the fuids
have been bled...

177
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:30,735
from its body.

178
00:11:30,803 --> 00:11:33,101
Almost like it's been cured.

179
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:35,436
I think...

180
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:37,100
it's a male.

181
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:38,666
Barely.

182
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:41,942
I'd say it's some kind
ofspider's nest...

183
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:44,210
or insect cocoon.

184
00:11:44,283 --> 00:11:47,047
What kind ofinsect
could have gotten a man...

185
00:11:47,153 --> 00:11:49,178
all the way up
into that tree?

186
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:51,586
Itsy-bitsy spider.

187
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:02,968
(Creaking)

188
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:33,361
(Clanking)

189
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:53,284
Don't move.

190
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:55,183
Who areyou?

191
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,557
Doug Spinney.

192
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:02,287
I ought to shootyou.

193
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:04,226
Might as well
shootyourselftoo.

194
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:06,322
You're in a spot
to be testing me.

195
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,128
What happened to my men?

196
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:09,190
What men?

197
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:11,566
The men who were
working this camp.

198
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:14,571
I don't know.

199
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,130
Probably the same thing...

200
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:18,370
will happen to us
when the sun goes down.

201
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:19,877
What areyou doing?

202
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:21,277
This animal's Doug Spinney.

203
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:23,474
He's responsible
for all the monkeywrenching.

204
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:24,811
He's probably a murderer.

205
00:13:24,884 --> 00:13:26,010
I'm no murderer.

206
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:27,074
You're a liar.

207
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:28,710
Let's hear him out.

208
00:13:28,821 --> 00:13:31,847
Ifwe stand around,
there will be nothing left to say.

209
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,825
Think about getting
that generator started.

210
00:13:34,894 --> 00:13:36,828
Darkness is our enemy.

211
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:38,887
What's he talking about?

212
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:41,263
Someone want to give me a hand?

213
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:42,460
Now he's giving orders?

214
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:43,729
I'm the one...

215
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:45,327
who fixed the damn thing.

216
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:46,837
Mulder:
It's all right.

217
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:57,406
Why did you say
that darkness was our enemy?

218
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:00,679
That's when they come.

219
00:14:00,786 --> 00:14:02,253
When who comes?

220
00:14:03,823 --> 00:14:05,757
I don't know what it is.

221
00:14:05,825 --> 00:14:08,760
They come from the sky,
take a man right offhis feet...

222
00:14:08,828 --> 00:14:10,227
and devour him alive.

223
00:14:10,296 --> 00:14:12,127
I saw it happen.

224
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:13,324
Happen to who?

225
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,230
(Engine Sputtering)

226
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:16,734
(ldling Smoothly)

227
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:18,235
I need to eat.

228
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:20,238
I haven't eaten in three days.

229
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:25,800
What kind of B.S. story
is that, huh?

230
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:27,539
You believe that?

231
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:30,713
We found something
in the forest.

232
00:14:30,783 --> 00:14:31,750
What?

233
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:33,751
A man caught in some kind...

234
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:35,081
ofinsect cocoon.

235
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:41,393
What happened here?

236
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:44,996
We camped two valleys over,
four ofus.

237
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:46,122
Three now.

238
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:47,962
More rats in the woodpile.

239
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:51,669
Our truck has a dead battery.

240
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:53,967
We drew straws to see
who would make the hike...

241
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,803
to steal one
from the loggers.

242
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,866
Why notjust hike out?

243
00:14:57,944 --> 00:14:59,309
It's over a day's hike.

244
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:01,869
No waywe wanted to be caught
in the forest after dark...

245
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:03,939
not after
what happened to Teague.

246
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:06,780
That's the man you said
was devoured alive?

247
00:15:06,852 --> 00:15:07,841
Yeah.

248
00:15:07,954 --> 00:15:10,149
Why areyou out here?

249
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:11,689
Camping.

250
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:14,624
The kind ofcamping you do
is a federal offense.

251
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:16,889
just hold offa second, okay?

252
00:15:16,963 --> 00:15:18,225
No, he's right.

253
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:20,231
This man
is an admitted felon.

254
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:21,698
He could be arrested.

255
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:24,827
What aboutyour offense,
my friend, huh?

256
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:27,168
What aboutyour offense
against nature?

257
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,231
We operate within the law.

258
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:31,469
We pay for the right
to take those trees.

259
00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:34,672
Well, your logging crew
is taking trees...

260
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:36,715
that are marked and protected...

261
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:39,649
so don't talk to me
about breaking the law...

262
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:41,346
sir.

263
00:15:41,454 --> 00:15:42,785
They've taken marked trees?

264
00:15:42,888 --> 00:15:44,719
Yes, sir, marked in orange.

265
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,984
Old growth trees?

266
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:49,027
You know anything
about that, Steve?

267
00:15:49,095 --> 00:15:50,426
No.

268
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:56,367
You going to take
this man's word...

269
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:58,266
over mine?

270
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:02,569
You don't want to go
out in the night.

271
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:04,633
Take myword on that.

272
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:07,244
It's out there.

273
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:08,712
Ifl go out that door...

274
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:12,547
something's going to eat me
and spin me in its web?

275
00:16:12,618 --> 00:16:14,609
Yes.

276
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:16,814
It's too polite to come in here...

277
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:18,355
and get me?

278
00:16:18,424 --> 00:16:21,188
For some reason,
it's, uh, afraid ofthe light.

279
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,887
It's afraid ofthe light.

280
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:25,863
There may be something
to what he's saying, Steve.

281
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:29,697
He's a murderer, clever enough
to make up a story like that...

282
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:32,761
even whip up that cocoon
to save a few trees...

283
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:35,329
and I'm going
to prove I'm right.

284
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,901
This is ridiculous.

285
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:49,218
Where is it, Spinney?

286
00:16:50,956 --> 00:16:54,892
I thought it was going
to come and devour me.

287
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:57,223
Humphreys:
Here I am!

288
00:16:57,296 --> 00:17:00,231
(Zapping)

289
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:02,392
Come out, come out,
whereveryou are.

290
00:17:05,237 --> 00:17:08,900
Aw, don't be shy.
Come on.

291
00:17:08,974 --> 00:17:09,963
Huh?

292
00:17:12,178 --> 00:17:14,169
It'sjust like I told you.

293
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:17,181
There's nothing out here
but a bunch oftrees...

294
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:19,911
that this man values
more than human life.

295
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:23,079
I'm going to see him
tried on murder charges.

296
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:27,793
What doyou think?

297
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:29,827
I think
I'm going to suggest...

298
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:32,090
that we sleep
with the lights on.

299
00:17:32,164 --> 00:17:34,155
(Sighs)

300
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:47,380
(Zapping)

301
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:57,717
You see this Douglas fir?

302
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,758
It's been standing here
since before time...

303
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:01,793
and your men cut it down.

304
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:03,453
Scully:
Who marks these trees?

305
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:04,791
Federal Forest Service.

306
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:06,798
You're only supposed
to cut trees...

307
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:07,855
with a blue X.

308
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:09,924
Mulder:
It must be hundreds ofyears old.

309
00:18:10,002 --> 00:18:13,199
Scully: Must get a lot oflumber
from a tree like this.

310
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:15,638
Thousands ofboard feet.
Hell ofa lot easier...

311
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,733
than taking a lot
ofsmaller, younger trees.

312
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,801
Monkeywrenchers
like Spinney here...

313
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:21,744
are not above marking trees...

314
00:18:21,814 --> 00:18:23,008
with their own paint.

315
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:25,482
This tree's 500 years old
ifit's a day.

316
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:26,551
Mulder:
Look at this.

317
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:30,122
What would this represent?

318
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:36,152
I don't know. I've never seen
a ring like that before.

319
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:38,753
Those center rings
are older rings, right?

320
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:41,766
Yeah. Every ring represents
a season ofgrowth.

321
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:43,392
And you see these?

322
00:18:43,469 --> 00:18:45,334
These are 500, 600 years old.

323
00:18:45,404 --> 00:18:48,862
They're a recorded history
ofrainfall and climate.

324
00:18:48,941 --> 00:18:50,909
But this one, I don't know.

325
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:52,910
I should take a core sample.

326
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:55,105
We finished
with this nature walk?

327
00:18:55,181 --> 00:18:57,308
What happened
to those loggers?

328
00:18:57,383 --> 00:18:58,907
We're determining that.

329
00:18:59,018 --> 00:19:00,610
Don'tyou think...

330
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:02,812
you should be
interrogating this man?

331
00:19:02,922 --> 00:19:04,321
I don't think he did it.

332
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,880
I want him arrested.

333
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:07,117
He's not leaving.

334
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:08,990
No, not with a gun on him.

335
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:11,529
What happens
ifhis three buddies show up...

336
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:13,588
and do toyou what they did...

337
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,134
to those two federal
forest officials?

338
00:19:16,202 --> 00:19:18,534
I just want to take
a core sample.

339
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:22,267
I got families who want
some answers about loved ones...

340
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:24,673
answers not found
in that tree.

341
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:27,439
The only crime is
the death ofthat tree.

342
00:19:27,513 --> 00:19:29,674
Yeah, well,
we'll see about that.

343
00:19:33,352 --> 00:19:34,341
Whereyou going?

344
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:36,421
I'm hiking down toyour truck...

345
00:19:36,522 --> 00:19:38,490
and get some people up here...

346
00:19:38,591 --> 00:19:40,081
who will take action.

347
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:41,489
Steve!

348
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,527
Let him go.

349
00:19:42,628 --> 00:19:44,562
Let him find out for himself.

350
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:50,968
This is odd.

351
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:54,671
This yellow ring's
got something living in it...

352
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,537
some kind of...

353
00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:58,008
tiny bug.

354
00:19:58,077 --> 00:19:59,977
It doesn't make sense.

355
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:02,172
Why not?

356
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:05,706
Well, parasites attack
a tree in a variety ofways...

357
00:20:05,784 --> 00:20:07,752
but they always attack
the living parts:

358
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:10,754
the leaves, the roots,
the new growth rings.

359
00:20:10,823 --> 00:20:13,758
Even ifthey're borers
ofsome kind...

360
00:20:13,826 --> 00:20:16,886
theywouldn't be working
so deep in the tree.

361
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:19,192
Maybe the wood
in this ring is different.

362
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:21,495
They seem to be
feeding on it.

363
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:23,034
Can you identify them?

364
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:24,831
It's a wood mite ofsome kind.

365
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:29,000
Could they have been living
in that tree for hundreds ofyears?

366
00:20:29,074 --> 00:20:31,304
No. Inner rings
are dead wood.

367
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:33,572
The tree's vascular system...

368
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:35,637
is limited
to the outer few rings.

369
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:37,773
They need water to survive.

370
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,648
They appear to be hatching
out ofthe wood.

371
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:44,211
Maybe when you
drew out this core...

372
00:20:44,323 --> 00:20:46,188
you tapped into a larger nest.

373
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:47,919
Spinney:
Can they build a cocoon?

374
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:53,496
Right after that tree was
cut down is when Teague died.

375
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:56,558
It's about the same time that
the loggers disappeared too.

376
00:20:56,635 --> 00:20:58,569
You think these mites
killed the men?

377
00:20:58,637 --> 00:21:01,800
Maybe they been dormant
for hundreds ofyears.

378
00:21:01,874 --> 00:21:04,809
Maybe theywoke up hungry.

379
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,735
Damn it!

380
00:21:32,805 --> 00:21:34,773
(Sighs)

381
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,075
(Humming)

382
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:21,585
All right,
you monkeywrenchers...

383
00:22:21,654 --> 00:22:22,643
come on out now.

384
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:29,925
I know whatyou're up to!

385
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:48,307
(Humming)

386
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:27,509
(Horn Honks)

387
00:23:49,908 --> 00:23:52,672
(Grunting)

388
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:04,150
(Screaming)

389
00:24:05,124 --> 00:24:09,356
(ldling Smoothly)

390
00:24:12,464 --> 00:24:15,695
Humphreys should have been
back by now.

391
00:24:15,768 --> 00:24:18,202
These bugs
aren't moving anymore.

392
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,137
They're either dead,
or they're asleep.

393
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:24,903
It's the light.
They don't like the light.

394
00:24:24,977 --> 00:24:27,605
Scully: Usually,
bugs are attracted to light.

395
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,046
Spinney: These obviously
are notyour ordinary bugs...

396
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:33,243
to say the least.

397
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:35,218
Doyou know insects, Scully?

398
00:24:36,455 --> 00:24:38,980
Uh,just what I learned
in my biology courses.

399
00:24:39,091 --> 00:24:42,060
They're the foundation
ofour ecosystem.

400
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:44,220
There are lots ofthem,
something like...

401
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:46,456
200 million per person.

402
00:24:46,532 --> 00:24:48,591
They've been around a long time?

403
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,965
Yeah, something like
600 million years--

404
00:24:51,036 --> 00:24:53,061
before the dinosaurs. Why?

405
00:24:53,138 --> 00:24:55,766
This tree is what,
600, 700 years old?

406
00:24:55,841 --> 00:24:57,172
Yeah.

407
00:24:57,242 --> 00:25:00,006
These rings represent
a history ofclimatic changes...

408
00:25:00,078 --> 00:25:03,775
which means that, in this year
in the life ofthe tree...

409
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:06,875
there was some strange event
that produced an abnormal ring.

410
00:25:06,952 --> 00:25:08,419
Like what, exactly?

411
00:25:08,487 --> 00:25:09,852
A volcanic eruption.

412
00:25:09,922 --> 00:25:12,186
This whole chain ofmountains...

413
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:14,725
running from Washington
to Oregon is active.

414
00:25:14,793 --> 00:25:16,283
Remember Mount St. Helens?

415
00:25:16,395 --> 00:25:19,091
Yeah. How does that
explain the bugs?

416
00:25:19,164 --> 00:25:21,792
After Mount St. Helens erupted,
there was radiation unleashed...

417
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:23,835
from inside the Earth.

418
00:25:23,902 --> 00:25:26,029
Strange things started to grow.

419
00:25:26,104 --> 00:25:28,664
There's this lake where
they discovered an amoeba...

420
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,731
that sucks a man's brains out.

421
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:32,902
Oh, a brain-sucking amoeba.

422
00:25:32,978 --> 00:25:34,912
It's true. Spirit Lake.
There's documented cases...

423
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,242
ofinfected swimmers.

424
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:37,646
But an amoeba is...

425
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:39,911
a single-celled organism
that can be mutated.

426
00:25:39,985 --> 00:25:42,249
An insect is a complex animal.

427
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:45,779
A mutation
would takeyears to evolve.

428
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:48,860
Maybe what we're dealing with
isn't a mutation at all.

429
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:52,624
What ifit's some kind
ofextinct insect larvae...

430
00:25:52,698 --> 00:25:54,029
in that ring--

431
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:56,158
deposited during
volcanic activity...

432
00:25:56,235 --> 00:25:58,703
brought up through
the tree's root system.

433
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,237
Ancient insect eggs...

434
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:02,364
thousands,
maybe millions ofyears old...

435
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:03,567
Iying dormant--

436
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:06,475
Until those loggers
cut down that tree.

437
00:26:08,213 --> 00:26:11,580
That would be rather
poeticjustice, don'tyou think...

438
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,744
unleashing the very thing
that would end up killing them...

439
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,414
and your friend Humphreys?

440
00:26:17,522 --> 00:26:19,251
And who knows?

441
00:26:19,358 --> 00:26:20,848
Maybe us.

442
00:26:22,794 --> 00:26:24,659
Sweet dreams.

443
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:30,765
Humphreys might
havejust hiked out ofhere.

444
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:33,396
We don't know that he didn't.

445
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:35,998
Maybe we're letting ourselves
get carried away...

446
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:37,564
with this bug story.

447
00:26:37,643 --> 00:26:38,940
Yeah, maybe.

448
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:18,983
(ldling Smoothly)

449
00:27:31,997 --> 00:27:33,555
Mulder:
Going somewhere?

450
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:34,757
No, I was--

451
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:35,959
Doing auto repair?

452
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:38,696
You're planning
on cutting out.

453
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,738
My friends
only had enough gas...

454
00:27:40,806 --> 00:27:43,934
to keep their generator
running 20 hours.

455
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:46,000
They'll die
ifl don't get back.

456
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:47,067
Why sneak around?

457
00:27:47,145 --> 00:27:49,807
The forest service guy
wouldn't go for it.

458
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:51,246
He'd never trust me.

459
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:53,807
He's got no reason to.
Neither do l.

460
00:27:53,885 --> 00:27:56,319
I can save us all.
We've got aJeep.

461
00:27:56,388 --> 00:27:59,357
It'sjust two valleys over.
It needs a battery.

462
00:27:59,424 --> 00:28:01,153
I can be back in the morning.

463
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:03,284
We can all drive out tomorrow.

464
00:28:06,698 --> 00:28:08,666
You got to trust me, man.

465
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,502
Mulder:
Radio's back up.

466
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:25,941
It's working?

467
00:28:26,018 --> 00:28:27,952
I'm not getting
any reception...

468
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,954
so the receiver
could be trashed.

469
00:28:30,055 --> 00:28:32,523
What about transmissions?
Can you send a message?

470
00:28:32,624 --> 00:28:34,091
I could try.

471
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:36,990
This is a call for help.

472
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:39,155
Is there anyone
at this frequency?

473
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:46,337
This is Special Agent Mulder
ofthe FBl.

474
00:28:46,405 --> 00:28:49,306
We have an emergency
and a possible quarantine.

475
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:50,898
Our position is--

476
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,551
(Generator Dies)

477
00:29:00,585 --> 00:29:02,246
What happened to the generator?

478
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,309
I turned it off.

479
00:29:03,388 --> 00:29:05,583
Turn it back on.
The radio's working.

480
00:29:05,657 --> 00:29:07,181
Where's the gas can?

481
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:08,988
Spinney took it.

482
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:10,824
He took it?

483
00:29:10,896 --> 00:29:12,727
You mean he's gone?

484
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:15,767
He left earlier.
He took a battery and gas.

485
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:16,960
He's coming back.

486
00:29:17,035 --> 00:29:19,094
He gave his personal guarantee?

487
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:21,332
He gave me his word, yeah.

488
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,002
The man who gaveyou his word
has made an art out ofsabotage...

489
00:29:26,111 --> 00:29:29,080
and defying authority,
and is probably the man...

490
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:31,172
who put that bullet
through mywindshield.

491
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:32,978
What would you have done?

492
00:29:33,051 --> 00:29:36,851
We've got one chance,
which is one more than we had.

493
00:29:36,922 --> 00:29:38,150
Or one less.

494
00:29:38,223 --> 00:29:39,656
What doyou mean?

495
00:29:39,724 --> 00:29:42,124
He let Spinney take
the last ofthe gas.

496
00:29:42,194 --> 00:29:45,288
This generator's got
about a quarter tank left.

497
00:29:45,363 --> 00:29:47,297
What about the trucks?

498
00:29:47,365 --> 00:29:50,391
The tanks have been ruptured
or filled with sugar.

499
00:29:50,469 --> 00:29:53,836
By the man we are trusting
to come back for us.

500
00:29:53,939 --> 00:29:57,170
We got to get on the radio
and send a Mayday.

501
00:29:57,275 --> 00:29:58,833
Every drop offuel...

502
00:29:58,944 --> 00:30:01,242
is going to keep
this gennie powered tonight.

503
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:02,940
I don't want to wait...

504
00:30:03,014 --> 00:30:04,948
hoping somebody heard
that transmission...

505
00:30:05,016 --> 00:30:08,679
when this thing quits running
about 2:00 in the morning.

506
00:30:08,753 --> 00:30:09,913
Doyou?

507
00:30:16,828 --> 00:30:18,056
(Sighs)

508
00:30:23,602 --> 00:30:25,593
(Groans)

509
00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:38,138
Mulder--

510
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:40,548
It's done.
I shouldn't have let him go.

511
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:42,780
Let'sjust move past it, okay?

512
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:45,620
Fine.

513
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,681
What doyou suggest?

514
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:49,624
I don't know.

515
00:30:49,694 --> 00:30:51,685
We'll think ofsomething.

516
00:30:51,763 --> 00:30:54,459
I thinkwe both
have a good idea...

517
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:56,524
ofwhat happened
to those loggers...

518
00:30:56,601 --> 00:30:59,468
and what happened
to the group in 1 934.

519
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:01,198
They only found one cocoon.

520
00:31:01,306 --> 00:31:02,739
It's a big forest.

521
00:31:02,807 --> 00:31:04,297
What would you have done?

522
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:08,038
Would I have made a decision myself
that affected us all?

523
00:31:08,113 --> 00:31:10,081
Cut the sanctimonious crap.

524
00:31:10,148 --> 00:31:12,412
What doyou want me to say?

525
00:31:12,484 --> 00:31:14,247
We might die up here.

526
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:17,049
Ifwe're lucky, they'll find
our bodies spun up in a tree...

527
00:31:17,122 --> 00:31:20,250
or they may not
find us at all!

528
00:31:20,325 --> 00:31:24,261
You're right, and we're
wasting time arguing about it.

529
00:31:39,644 --> 00:31:41,578
What areyou going to do?

530
00:31:41,646 --> 00:31:43,136
Button this place up.

531
00:31:43,248 --> 00:31:45,239
Ifwe got to spend
the night in here...

532
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:47,251
we got to do
everything we can...

533
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:49,753
to make sure the bugs
stay out there.

534
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:04,925
I'd be careful with that.

535
00:32:05,003 --> 00:32:06,994
It's the only bulb that works.

536
00:32:12,844 --> 00:32:16,803
(ldling Roughly)

537
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:54,578
I can see them.

538
00:32:58,056 --> 00:32:59,990
You guys, look at this.

539
00:33:05,764 --> 00:33:07,755
Look. They're coming
through the wall...

540
00:33:07,832 --> 00:33:09,424
down where it's dark.

541
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:11,264
You see them?

542
00:33:14,806 --> 00:33:16,273
(Gasps Softly)

543
00:33:17,475 --> 00:33:18,737
They're on me!

544
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,834
Mulder:
It's all right.

545
00:33:19,944 --> 00:33:20,933
Scully, Scully--

546
00:33:21,046 --> 00:33:22,479
Get them offme!

547
00:33:22,547 --> 00:33:23,605
Whoa! Watch it!

548
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:24,706
Stand still!

549
00:33:24,783 --> 00:33:26,045
Stop it!

550
00:33:26,117 --> 00:33:27,516
Can you see them?

551
00:33:27,585 --> 00:33:28,779
Get them off!.

552
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:30,514
They're notjust on you.

553
00:33:30,588 --> 00:33:31,646
They're everywhere.

554
00:33:31,723 --> 00:33:33,714
That's what that residue is
over everything.

555
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:35,726
I thought we were safe
in the light!

556
00:33:35,794 --> 00:33:37,091
We are!

557
00:33:37,162 --> 00:33:39,995
I think the light
keeps them from swarming.

558
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:43,057
We'll be safe as long
as we stay in the light.

559
00:33:59,918 --> 00:34:03,319
(ldling Smoothly)

560
00:34:11,563 --> 00:34:14,123
Howyou feeling?

561
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,632
I'm okay.

562
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,274
They're oxidizing enzymes...

563
00:34:24,342 --> 00:34:26,003
just like firefies.

564
00:34:28,713 --> 00:34:31,773
Maybe that's why
they cocoon their prey--

565
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:34,375
so that they can oxidize
the proteins...

566
00:34:34,452 --> 00:34:36,943
taken from the fuids
in the body.

567
00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:44,918
What ifthe generator goes?

568
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:48,090
Will they swarm in here
and drain the life out ofus?

569
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:50,396
We got an hour and a half
till sunrise.

570
00:34:50,468 --> 00:34:53,130
Then what? It's over
a day's hike out ofhere.

571
00:34:53,238 --> 00:34:55,468
We won't make it on foot
by nightfall.

572
00:34:55,573 --> 00:34:57,632
Maybe somebody
heard our transmission.

573
00:34:57,742 --> 00:34:59,676
Help could be on the way.

574
00:34:59,744 --> 00:35:01,712
You sent that call hours ago.

575
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:04,941
I mean, help would have
been here by now.

576
00:35:06,951 --> 00:35:09,749
Well, I'm not going
to give up on Spinney.

577
00:35:09,821 --> 00:35:12,722
He gave me his word
he'd come back to get us.

578
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:14,782
And ifhe doesn't?

579
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:17,919
We'll think ofsomething.

580
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:23,425
(ldling Roughly)

581
00:35:28,573 --> 00:35:31,804
(Generator Sputtering)

582
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:36,646
(Sputtering lncreases)

583
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:40,576
(Generator Dies)

584
00:36:10,148 --> 00:36:12,275
You got a patch kit
in your truck?

585
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,647
Yeah.

586
00:36:13,718 --> 00:36:16,243
Maybe we can patch this
or get it to hold air.

587
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:19,484
With the truck's spare, maybe we
can limp down the mountain.

588
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,187
Ifnot, we can get on the radio
and warn them what's out here.

589
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:45,115
(Thunder Rumbling)

590
00:37:01,132 --> 00:37:02,394
Moore:
See it?

591
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:03,729
Mulder:
Yeah.

592
00:37:16,214 --> 00:37:19,183
(Low Humming)

593
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,808
Listen.

594
00:37:20,885 --> 00:37:22,750
You hear that?

595
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,754
Moore:
It's a car.

596
00:37:29,494 --> 00:37:31,428
No. It's aJeep.

597
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:37,057
We got to move.
Let's go! Let's go!

598
00:37:37,135 --> 00:37:38,227
Wait!

599
00:37:38,303 --> 00:37:40,464
What about the body--
Humphreys' body?

600
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:43,370
Leave it. I've radioed for help.

601
00:37:43,474 --> 00:37:44,668
Where areyour friends?

602
00:37:44,776 --> 00:37:45,902
They didn't make it.

603
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,102
We won't either...

604
00:37:47,211 --> 00:37:48,872
unless we haul ass.

605
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:50,938
Let's go.
Come on.

606
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:29,175
Spinney:
Oh!

607
00:38:31,522 --> 00:38:32,784
Damn it!

608
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:43,132
Moore:
I don't believe it.

609
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:46,637
You talk about
shooting yourselfin the foot.

610
00:38:53,878 --> 00:38:55,140
(Yelling)

611
00:38:55,213 --> 00:38:57,044
Get out ofthere!
Get in the car!

612
00:38:57,115 --> 00:38:59,784
(Yelling)

613
00:39:26,577 --> 00:39:29,068
(Groaning)

614
00:39:34,118 --> 00:39:36,109
(Screaming)

615
00:40:25,236 --> 00:40:27,602
We have an emergency
evacuation situation.

616
00:40:27,672 --> 00:40:30,334
Requesting quarantine facility
for two...

617
00:40:30,408 --> 00:40:31,568
possibly three victims...

618
00:40:31,642 --> 00:40:33,633
with undiagnosed infection
or exposure...

619
00:40:33,711 --> 00:40:35,804
to unknown biological vectors.

620
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,872
Repeat, that's an emergency
evacuation situation.

621
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,009
Two, possibly three victims--

622
00:41:31,702 --> 00:41:33,567
How areyou feeling?

623
00:41:33,604 --> 00:41:34,628
Better.

624
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:36,673
How did the tests come back?

625
00:41:36,741 --> 00:41:39,335
Your respiratory charts
were good.

626
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:40,604
We were concerned...

627
00:41:40,678 --> 00:41:43,146
about the damage
due to inhalation.

628
00:41:43,214 --> 00:41:45,205
There were large concentrations...

629
00:41:45,283 --> 00:41:47,274
ofthe chemical we determined
was luciferin.

630
00:41:47,351 --> 00:41:48,340
Which is what?

631
00:41:48,419 --> 00:41:50,887
The same enzyme
we find in firefies...

632
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:53,048
and other
bioluminescent insects.

633
00:41:53,124 --> 00:41:55,592
Our entomologists
are still trying to determine...

634
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,093
the specific epithet...

635
00:41:57,161 --> 00:41:59,322
ofthe insects
you encountered.

636
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,428
Scully?

637
00:42:08,172 --> 00:42:09,969
How's she doing?

638
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:12,271
She's still not out of
the woods, so to speak.

639
00:42:12,343 --> 00:42:14,106
She lost a lot offuids.

640
00:42:14,178 --> 00:42:17,375
Two or three more hours
ofexposure...

641
00:42:17,448 --> 00:42:19,313
she might not
have made it.

642
00:42:19,383 --> 00:42:22,944
I told her it was going to be
a nice trip to the forest.

643
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:28,723
Howyou going to contain it
to the forest?

644
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:32,158
What ifthe swarm migrates?

645
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:35,199
The government has initiated
eradication procedures.

646
00:42:35,266 --> 00:42:37,996
They're quite certain that,
by using a combination

647
00:42:38,102 --> 00:42:40,127
ofcontrolled burns
and pesticides...

648
00:42:40,238 --> 00:42:42,399
theywill be successful.

649
00:42:42,473 --> 00:42:43,963
And ifthey're not?

650
00:42:47,578 --> 00:42:50,240
That is not an option,
Mr. Mulder.

651
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,397
Imade this!
