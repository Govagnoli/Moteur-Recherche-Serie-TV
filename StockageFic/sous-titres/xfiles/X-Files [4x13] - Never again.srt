360

when an authoritative...

comes into my life.

364
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,760
But then at
a certain point,

365

I just, you know--

366
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:16,240
Okay, um--

367
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,720
My father was
a navy captain.

368
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,800
I worshipped--

369
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,640
I worship the sea
that he sailed on.

370
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,240
And when I was 1 3 or so,
I went through this thing,

371
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,600
where I would sneak out
of my parents' house...

372
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,840
and smoke
my mother's cigarettes.

373
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,600
And I did it because I knew that
if he found out, he would kill me.

374
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,680
And then along the way,

375

has come around again.

want to go backward.

Do it for me.

505
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,280
Ow !

506
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,440
- This isn't you, Ed !
- [Woman's Voice]Go on, Eddie !

507
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,080
- Get control of yourself.
- Ah, but it's good to lose control.

508
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,000
- Take control !
- Do it for me, Eddie! Do it!

509
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,960
- [ Eddie Screaming ]
- No !

510
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,000
[ Screaming ]

511
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,080
- [ Screaming ]
- [Woman's Voice Laughing]

512
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,080
[ Screaming ]

513
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,200
Welcome back.

514
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,160
You look a lot better than
you did in the hospital.

515
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:24,680
And congratulations for
making a personal appearance in
the X files for the second time.

516
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,920
It's a world record.

517
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,600
Ed Jerse is in custody at the
St. John's Burn Center in Philadelphia.

518
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,400
Traces of ergot were found
in his blood stream, as in yours,

519
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,560
but not to the degree that should
cause hallucinogen icergotism.

520
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:44,320
He'll undergo psychiatric evaluation
after recovering from burn trauma.

521
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,960
Comrade Svo
has been shut down...

522
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,600
and is under investigation for having
connections to my friend Pudovkin.

523
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,400
Case closed on Boris Badenov,
which is really a shame,

524
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,600
because I was thinking of having
an N.Y. tattooed on my ass...

525
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,440
to commemorate the Yankees
World Series victory.

526
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,200
Better late than never, huh ?

527
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,960
The, uh...

528
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,560
field office
in Dallas is, uh,

529
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,560
receiving reports of
an image of a missing child...

530
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,720
appearing on a blank billboard
outside of Arlington.

531
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,240
So--

532
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,000
All this because l--

533
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,240
because I didn't
get you a desk ?

534
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,480
Not everything is
about you, Mulder.

535
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,880
This is my life.

536
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,000
Yes, but it's--

537
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,280
