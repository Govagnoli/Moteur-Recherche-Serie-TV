1
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,976
AJell-O salad
with little pear chunks.

2
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:17,608
It's the Wednesday special at the
hospital cafeteria. I can't escape it.

3
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,346
Listen to you. That didn't stop you
from eating my dessert.

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,615
Well, all right.
The profiteroles weren't bad.

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,817
- You didn't want me to starve, did you?

6
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,826
He ate mine too.

7
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,021
Daddy, why don't you take this
before my arm falls off.

8
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:33,259
Thanks, honey.

9
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,267
Everybody?

10
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:38,099
- One last shot.
- Oh, Dad.

11
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:40,799
Do you think we can draw the line
at 600 photographs?

12
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,206
Six hundred and one.

13
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:46,336
Quit griping.
And hold up that eyesore, Robert.

14
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,779
God knows when you're
gonna win another one.

15
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:51,442
Irv, you wanna think
about staying the night?

16
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,078
- It's awful late
to head back to the city.
- Yeah.

17
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:57,817
What? I get to stay at the home of
the Bay Area Doctor of the Year?

18
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,825
It's a deal.

19
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,863
Proud of you, Robert.

20
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,868
Up. Hold it up.
Say "cheese."

21
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:15,071
"Presented to
Dr. Robert Wieder M. D...

22
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,042
"for the great wisdom,
skill and compassion...

23
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,409
he exhibits in
the practice of medicine."

24
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,611
It's gonna look awfully nice
in your office.

25
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,057
What are you thinking?

26
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,186
How this is just
the cherry on top.

27
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,365
How lucky I am.

28
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,837
- What is it?
- Downstairs motion sensor.

29
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,774
You think Dad
tripped the alarm?

30
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,778
The alarm
hasn't been tripped.

31
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,373
You got me.
I'll go check it out.

32
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,227
Irv?

33
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,260
Irving,
is everything all right?

34
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:18,746
What do you think, Scully?
Is this a name, possibly,

35
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:20,950
or a code or an anagram?

36
00:04:21,025 --> 00:04:23,016
T-H-E-E-F.

37
00:04:23,094 --> 00:04:26,325
I assume it's supposed to be
T-H-I-E-F. Thief.

38
00:04:26,397 --> 00:04:29,230
Insert your own
Dan Quayle joke here.

39
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,133
Lousy spelling aside, what do you think
it refers to? Who's the thief?

40
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:34,194
Well, that's certainly one question.

41
00:04:34,272 --> 00:04:36,137
I've got many.

42
00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:38,675
"Mulder,
why are we here?"

43
00:04:38,743 --> 00:04:41,906
Mmm, to be fair,
I might have used the words,

44
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:44,311
"Mulder,
how is this an X-File?"

45
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:47,681
You see that, Scully?
You always keep me guessing.

46
00:04:47,752 --> 00:04:52,587
This is Dr. Irving Thalbro, age 66,
found hanged with his throat cut,

47
00:04:52,657 --> 00:04:55,023
his family tucked away and
in bed not 40 feet from here.

48
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:57,027
Didn't see or hear anything.

49
00:04:57,095 --> 00:05:00,121
Which would certainly shine
the light of suspicion on them.

50
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:02,098
Except they're the ones
that called it in,

51
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,896
and there's no evidence whatsoever
to link them to the crime.

52
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:07,164
Which is why the police
are rightly wondering...

53
00:05:07,238 --> 00:05:09,570
if Dr. Thalbro
killed himself.

54
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,767
Except who, then, did this?

55
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:14,573
Blood pattern doesn't indicate
that the good doctor did it,

56
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:17,512
who I am assuming could read and write
above a fourth grade level.

57
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:21,074
I'll admit, Mulder, this is not
an open-and-shut case.

58
00:05:21,152 --> 00:05:23,848
But, uh, it doesn't
make it an X-File.

59
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:25,855
Well, there is
one detail that does.

60
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:32,520
This.

61
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:34,224
Dirt?

62
00:05:34,298 --> 00:05:38,234
Dirt. It's a very powerful
component of hexcraft,

63
00:05:38,302 --> 00:05:40,702
as well as the pattern in which
it was originally arranged.

64
00:05:40,771 --> 00:05:42,705
Check this out.

65
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:48,339
- Looks like a human form.

66
00:05:48,412 --> 00:05:52,439
Hexcraft, as in putting
a curse on someone?

67
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:54,610
Murdering them magically?

68
00:05:54,685 --> 00:05:58,314
That's what it looks like to me. Now,
I know what you're gonna say, Scully.

69
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:02,120
No, hexcraft. I mean,
I'll buy that as the intent here.

70
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:03,956
It certainly jives
with the evidence.

71
00:06:04,028 --> 00:06:06,690
I say we talk
to the family.

72
00:06:12,436 --> 00:06:14,631
I'll always
keep you guessing.

73
00:06:17,975 --> 00:06:20,443
It was probably
the greatest night of my life.

74
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,445
Till...

75
00:06:24,315 --> 00:06:27,409
Sir, can you think of any enemies
your father-in-law might have made?

76
00:06:27,485 --> 00:06:30,249
Maybe inadvertently through
his medical practice...

77
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:32,846
or a business dealing,
perhaps?

78
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:35,119
Everybody loved Irving.

79
00:06:35,193 --> 00:06:37,753
Everyone who knew him.
He was...

80
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:43,159
No, I can't conceive of it.

81
00:06:43,234 --> 00:06:45,327
Dr. Wieder,
do you have any enemies?

82
00:06:47,104 --> 00:06:49,902
I'm sorry I have to ask.
There was a message left behind.

83
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:52,340
If it doesn't refer to your
father-in-law, it may refer to you.

84
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,004
Thief?

85
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:57,604
Are you asking
if my dad's a thief?

86
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:03,513
He saves people's lives.
He's a good man.

87
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:05,522
Honey.

88
00:07:07,758 --> 00:07:11,854
If I have any enemies,
I don't know them.

89
00:07:17,835 --> 00:07:20,463
At the home of his son-in-law,
Dr. Robert Wieder,

90
00:07:20,538 --> 00:07:24,531
Dr. Irving Thalbro was found
hanged at 1:48 this morning.

91
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:27,237
The details are sketchy.
It's my understanding...

92
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:30,542
that police are treating
the case as a murder.

93
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:34,210
This is due in part to
core evidence left at the scene.

94
00:08:00,678 --> 00:08:04,580
Hello? Mr. Peattie?

95
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:07,675
Mr. Peattie,
I know you're in there.

96
00:08:07,752 --> 00:08:10,016
Are you cooking?

97
00:08:10,087 --> 00:08:12,021
You aren't
supposed to be cooking.

98
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:22,696
You aren't supposed
to be cooking.

99
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:25,827
That smell like somethin'
you wanna eat?

100
00:08:25,903 --> 00:08:29,771
- Well, what is it, then?
- Medicine.

101
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:33,707
Oh, all right.
Uh,

102
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:36,178
just so long
as you're not cooking.

103
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:41,607
Seems like you could use yourself
a poultice for your back.

104
00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:45,188
Old Peattie fix ya right up.

105
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:47,190
Be ready later.

106
00:09:47,318 --> 00:09:51,254
- Scully. This dirt we found?
Gas pneumatograph shows...
- Mm-hmm.

107
00:09:51,322 --> 00:09:54,086
pronounced spikes of methane
and sulfur compounds.

108
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:56,092
The signature of decay.

109
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,288
It's graveyard dirt,
also known as conjure dust.

110
00:09:59,363 --> 00:10:02,924
It's one of the most powerful hexing
elements, whether for good or evil.

111
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,934
Not the kind of stuff you want
to be on the wrong end of.

112
00:10:05,002 --> 00:10:06,697
Uh-huh.

113
00:10:06,771 --> 00:10:10,138
Well, go ahead, Scully.
Keep me guessing.

114
00:10:10,207 --> 00:10:12,038
Kuru.

115
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:16,112
The-The, uh...

116
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,114
The disease that
New Guinea tribesmen get?

117
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:20,673
From eating the brains
of their relatives.

118
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:24,050
I thought my grandpa
slurping his soup was bad.

119
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:26,681
Practically speaking, Mulder,
Kuru doesn't even exist anymore,

120
00:10:26,757 --> 00:10:29,385
not in New Guinea
and certainly not in the U.S.

121
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,759
But this man's cerebellum
and his triadim...

122
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,697
clearly show signs of it,
Mulder.

123
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:38,394
I mean, these plaques...
his brain is riddled with them.

124
00:10:38,469 --> 00:10:40,869
Kuru makes you crazy, right?

125
00:10:40,938 --> 00:10:43,463
Yeah, stark-raving, among other things.
But in this case,

126
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:47,773
stark-raving mad enough to
slit his own throat and hang himself.

127
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:50,143
Mulder, that's what
his autopsy shows...

128
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:52,409
from the wound pattern
to-to the blood spray.

129
00:10:52,483 --> 00:10:55,748
- This man did it to himself.
There's no question.
- Unless...

130
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:58,755
it was inflicted upon him.

131
00:10:58,823 --> 00:11:00,757
The graveyard dirt, the hex.

132
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:03,885
He was given this disease
so that he would kill himself.

133
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:31,383
Nan? Honey?

134
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:41,188
Robert?

135
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:43,199
Look at this.

136
00:11:55,746 --> 00:11:58,306
It could be
they needed it as evidence.

137
00:12:22,337 --> 00:12:25,738
I'm telling you,
I'm scared.

138
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:28,901
I can't stay here, Robert.
I can't live in this house anymore.

139
00:12:28,977 --> 00:12:32,003
Lucy can't, not after
what's happened here.

140
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,014
And now this picture of us
is missing.

141
00:12:34,082 --> 00:12:36,880
- It'll turn up.
- No. It doesn't make any sense.

142
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:38,646
Nothing that's happened here
makes any sense.

143
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,847
It does.
Nan,

144
00:12:42,824 --> 00:12:45,349
listen to me.

145
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:47,918
Your dad was ill.

146
00:12:47,996 --> 00:12:50,328
He had a kind of
progressive dementia.

147
00:12:50,398 --> 00:12:52,696
That's what
the F.B.I. autopsy showed.

148
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:55,361
I reviewed their findings,
and I have to agree.

149
00:12:56,571 --> 00:12:59,972
Honey,
we will get through this.

150
00:13:19,694 --> 00:13:23,357
- Oh, my God! Nan, honey!

151
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:29,896
Oh, my God!

152
00:13:29,971 --> 00:13:32,166
- Nan!
- Dad?

153
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,731
Lucy, call 911.

154
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:38,575
Call 911!

155
00:13:38,646 --> 00:13:40,739
Nan!

156
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,440
Dr. Wieder?

157
00:14:21,656 --> 00:14:24,420
We understand
you've made a diagnosis.

158
00:14:26,461 --> 00:14:30,056
Diffuse Cutaneous Flesh Moniliasis.
Old World type.

159
00:14:31,766 --> 00:14:35,258
- I take it that's rare.
- In San Francisco? It's unheard of.

160
00:14:35,336 --> 00:14:38,430
Maybe in Central Africa.

161
00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:41,407
- Well, the rarer, the better.
- What do you mean by that?

162
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:44,240
Someone directed this
to happen to your wife...

163
00:14:44,312 --> 00:14:46,906
just as someone directed
what happened to your father-in-law.

164
00:14:46,981 --> 00:14:50,747
My enemy you were talking about...
the one who thinks I'm a thief?

165
00:14:54,022 --> 00:14:56,217
Agent, you're a doctor.
Explain to your partner...

166
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:59,124
that no one can direct
a person to get sick.

167
00:14:59,194 --> 00:15:01,924
The dirt you found in your bed
drawn in the shape of a body,

168
00:15:01,996 --> 00:15:04,556
that's indicative of
folk magic.

169
00:15:04,632 --> 00:15:06,600
That's what I believe
is being used against you.

170
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:10,160
Folk magic?

171
00:15:10,238 --> 00:15:13,969
You mean, like, Babayaga?
Gypsies?

172
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:16,806
I was actually thinking
less Eastern and more Celtic.

173
00:15:16,878 --> 00:15:19,813
Maybe Scots-Irish
or Appalachian, even.

174
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:22,372
I'm supposed to
take this seriously?

175
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,613
Sir, regardless
of the particulars,

176
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:28,622
I think it's clear that
there was an intruder in your home.

177
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,022
And I think it would be
prudent for you...

178
00:15:31,092 --> 00:15:33,856
to accept our protection...

179
00:15:33,928 --> 00:15:36,226
and help us to identify
this person.

180
00:15:36,297 --> 00:15:40,199
Prudent for me would be to
continue treating my wife.

181
00:15:40,268 --> 00:15:43,669
If we don't stop who's causing this,
your treatments won't matter.

182
00:15:43,738 --> 00:15:48,072
So modern medicine
and all it encompasses...

183
00:15:48,142 --> 00:15:51,976
artificial hearts, laser surgery,
gene therapy, to name a few...

184
00:15:52,046 --> 00:15:54,742
all of that arrayed against
a pile of magic dirt?

185
00:15:56,451 --> 00:15:59,352
And you tell me I'll lose.

186
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:06,359
I have M.R.I. s to look at.

187
00:16:09,964 --> 00:16:11,898
Oh, yeah, Mulder,
win him over.

188
00:16:11,966 --> 00:16:15,458
He will lose unless
we can find a way to stop it.

189
00:16:15,536 --> 00:16:17,470
What do you suggest?

190
00:16:18,706 --> 00:16:20,640
A second opinion.

191
00:16:41,663 --> 00:16:45,622
The truth always hurts,
don't it, Doc?

192
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,429
Who are you?

193
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,368
Is this you?
You did this?

194
00:16:59,013 --> 00:17:00,947
What do you want from me?

195
00:17:01,015 --> 00:17:04,576
Don't you be frettin' none
about that.

196
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:06,677
I'm gettin'
my nickel's worth.

197
00:17:06,754 --> 00:17:09,279
You're doin'
a fine job so far.

198
00:17:09,357 --> 00:17:12,053
What the hell are you talking about?
What is this all about?

199
00:17:12,126 --> 00:17:14,424
Lynette Peattie.

200
00:17:16,698 --> 00:17:19,531
And don't you be sayin'
you don't recollect her.

201
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,467
Uh-uh.
No, no, no.

202
00:17:22,537 --> 00:17:25,995
Look, if I've done anything
to upset you, I...

203
00:17:28,643 --> 00:17:32,511
It's no use trying to intimidate me
if I don't know how I've offended you!

204
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:36,810
Tell me!

205
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:38,818
What makes me a thief?

206
00:17:43,624 --> 00:17:46,457
You be a smart man.

207
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:48,961
I figure...

208
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:53,330
you ponder it a while,
it gonna come to ya.

209
00:17:59,574 --> 00:18:01,508
Wait!

210
00:18:13,354 --> 00:18:16,482
No. No matter how I spell it,
there's no Lynette Peattie.

211
00:18:18,126 --> 00:18:21,562
- She's not in my patient file.
- She's not in any doctor's patient file.

212
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:24,325
No one by that name has ever
been admitted to the hospital.

213
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:28,001
You think you treated her?

214
00:18:29,537 --> 00:18:31,903
What aboutJane Does?

215
00:18:38,046 --> 00:18:39,980
You treated three
in the last two years.

216
00:18:40,048 --> 00:18:42,812
Pull the files, please.

217
00:19:17,985 --> 00:19:21,978
You remember old Boon.
I know you do.

218
00:19:22,056 --> 00:19:26,959
This mangy, old, ugly dog.

219
00:19:27,028 --> 00:19:29,792
Smart.

220
00:19:29,864 --> 00:19:32,298
People-smart,
and then some.

221
00:19:34,068 --> 00:19:36,662
Oh, he sure did love you.

222
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:41,603
He crawled up
under that house...

223
00:19:41,676 --> 00:19:44,270
the very day you left.

224
00:19:44,345 --> 00:19:47,075
Wouldn't come out for nothin'.

225
00:19:47,148 --> 00:19:50,606
Not no ham bone, nothin'.

226
00:19:51,686 --> 00:19:55,713
He just knew that
his life was over.

227
00:19:58,693 --> 00:20:00,752
You stole his heart too.

228
00:20:04,265 --> 00:20:06,358
You shouldn't oughta left.

229
00:20:21,748 --> 00:20:23,579
You're there.

230
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:27,677
I... wanted to thank you.

231
00:20:27,754 --> 00:20:32,817
That poultice worked
a miracle on my back.

232
00:20:32,892 --> 00:20:35,190
I was about to knock and...

233
00:20:35,262 --> 00:20:38,095
and ask if I could get
a little more.

234
00:20:57,851 --> 00:21:01,287
Whatever that is,
it sure is stinky.

235
00:21:02,355 --> 00:21:04,289
Stinky's good.

236
00:21:28,415 --> 00:21:30,349
Good afternoon.

237
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:32,817
Can I help you?

238
00:21:32,886 --> 00:21:36,583
Yeah, we're looking for some
alternative medical advice.

239
00:21:37,991 --> 00:21:40,152
Well, you've come
to the right place.

240
00:21:40,226 --> 00:21:43,423
I get a lot of folks
fed up with their H.M.O.s.

241
00:21:43,496 --> 00:21:46,659
- Well, actually, we're not here for us.
- Yeah.

242
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:49,861
Oh! Chief,
back in your pocket.

243
00:21:49,936 --> 00:21:52,029
It's dirt.

244
00:21:52,105 --> 00:21:54,039
It's goofer dust
is what it is.

245
00:21:54,107 --> 00:21:56,541
I don't know what your
intentions are with that.

246
00:21:56,609 --> 00:21:59,339
- Goofer dust?
- Conjure dust, goofer dust.

247
00:21:59,412 --> 00:22:01,778
How would you go about
making somebody sick using that?

248
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,612
We're investigating a murder.
That's why I'm asking.

249
00:22:06,686 --> 00:22:08,620
Oh.

250
00:22:08,688 --> 00:22:11,384
Speaking strictly
in the academic sense,

251
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:15,087
you'd spread it on or near
your victim to direct misfortune.

252
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:18,562
So you could give them
any illness you wanted...

253
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:22,032
- One that you chose
specifically for them?
- Oh...

254
00:22:22,102 --> 00:22:24,764
that's a lot trickier.

255
00:22:24,838 --> 00:22:27,204
It requires
something special.

256
00:22:31,378 --> 00:22:35,610
- A voodoo doll.
- No. They're called "puppets."

257
00:22:35,682 --> 00:22:39,482
Inside, you place three thorns
of a blood red rose,

258
00:22:39,552 --> 00:22:42,783
a strand of hair,
and a photo of your victim.

259
00:22:42,856 --> 00:22:45,324
Maybe other items as well.
Depends on the operator.

260
00:22:45,392 --> 00:22:47,986
Sew it up, say your spell.

261
00:22:48,061 --> 00:22:50,325
How would you counteract
one of these?

262
00:22:50,397 --> 00:22:52,558
Depends on who
you're dealing with.

263
00:22:52,632 --> 00:22:54,896
But if the person
you're looking for...

264
00:22:54,968 --> 00:22:59,064
is powerful enough to bring about
a murder, he's probably charmed.

265
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:01,266
Which would mean what?

266
00:23:01,341 --> 00:23:03,502
It means just that.

267
00:23:03,576 --> 00:23:05,976
He's drawing on
the energy of a charm.

268
00:23:06,045 --> 00:23:08,411
A source of magic power.

269
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:10,847
It could be any item,

270
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:14,114
provided that
it's very important to him.

271
00:23:14,187 --> 00:23:16,121
Something that holds
great meaning for him.

272
00:23:16,189 --> 00:23:20,285
And unless you can separate him
from his charm,

273
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,294
you're out of luck.

274
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,644
Poppin' corn.

275
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,550
You gotta put
the money in first.

276
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:06,972
Don't look like
no poppin' corn to me.

277
00:24:08,575 --> 00:24:12,705
Put it in the microwave.
Then you get your popcorn.

278
00:24:15,915 --> 00:24:20,045
Oh. Microwave.

279
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:23,646
I heard tell of such a thing.
It's a true wonder.

280
00:24:35,235 --> 00:24:37,169
Radiation.

281
00:24:37,237 --> 00:24:40,365
Come from the heart
of the atom.

282
00:24:41,508 --> 00:24:45,205
I think it be God's own glow.

283
00:24:56,122 --> 00:24:58,352
You're gonna be very happy,
I promise.

284
00:24:58,424 --> 00:25:00,756
The drug therapy I'm giving her
is working wonders.

285
00:25:02,328 --> 00:25:04,262
Come on.
Come see.

286
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,431
- Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.

287
00:25:13,706 --> 00:25:16,675
- You look good.
- Yeah, right.

288
00:25:16,743 --> 00:25:18,734
But I am definitely
feeling better.

289
00:25:22,148 --> 00:25:25,140
- So how come I have to
go through this thing again?
- Come on.

290
00:25:25,218 --> 00:25:28,415
This thing gives off about
as much radiation as a dental X ray.

291
00:25:28,488 --> 00:25:30,786
- Nothing to worry about.
- I know.

292
00:25:30,857 --> 00:25:34,122
It just scares me.
Wish me luck?

293
00:26:31,684 --> 00:26:33,618
Doctor!

294
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:37,118
Switch it off.
Switch it off.

295
00:27:03,249 --> 00:27:05,183
All done.

296
00:27:25,738 --> 00:27:28,707
How could somebody
orchestrate all of this?

297
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:30,742
You believe that
your wife was murdered?

298
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:35,076
It was no accident. There was
no malfunction of the machine.

299
00:27:35,147 --> 00:27:37,081
Yes, I believe
she was murdered.

300
00:27:37,149 --> 00:27:39,583
And you still have
no idea why?

301
00:27:43,722 --> 00:27:47,556
The pathologist found this
branded into your wife's chest.

302
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:59,293
Sir, we can't help you if
you withhold information from us.

303
00:28:05,411 --> 00:28:07,436
A man came
to see me yesterday.

304
00:28:09,682 --> 00:28:11,616
My age, older, maybe.

305
00:28:11,684 --> 00:28:14,346
Tall.

306
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,150
He mentioned someone named
Lynette Peattie.

307
00:28:17,223 --> 00:28:20,488
I didn't know
who she was at first.

308
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,722
Turns out she was a Jane Doe
I treated last October.

309
00:28:25,698 --> 00:28:30,431
She was in a bus rollover.
Came in amid a wave of victims.

310
00:28:31,737 --> 00:28:33,967
She was the worst off.

311
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:37,873
I could barely put fluids in fast enough
to keep up with the blood loss.

312
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:43,572
We were rushing around
triaging people.

313
00:28:45,084 --> 00:28:47,882
Everybody knew
she was dying.

314
00:28:47,953 --> 00:28:50,387
It was only a matter of time.

315
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:54,392
She was in agony.

316
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:15,805
This was
my course of treatment.

317
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:18,543
You gave her morphine.

318
00:29:18,617 --> 00:29:20,847
Lots of it.

319
00:29:21,987 --> 00:29:23,921
I pushed it myself.

320
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:31,019
She kept screaming,

321
00:29:31,096 --> 00:29:33,189
and her heart rate
kept climbing.

322
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,693
So...

323
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:38,703
I kept pushing.

324
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:47,638
I took maybe the last
20 minutes of her life.

325
00:29:50,783 --> 00:29:52,717
It was a fair trade to make
for the pain.

326
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:57,282
Her father doesn't agree.

327
00:29:59,158 --> 00:30:01,456
What makes you think
it's her father?

328
00:30:01,527 --> 00:30:04,690
He thinks you robbed him
of his family.

329
00:30:04,763 --> 00:30:07,425
And that's why he's systematically
robbing you of yours.

330
00:30:09,702 --> 00:30:12,637
What am I supposed to do?
My daughter Lucy...

331
00:30:12,705 --> 00:30:15,731
You don't do anything.
Let us find a way to protect you.

332
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:19,266
- How?
- I have an idea where to start.

333
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:33,288
If Lynette Peattie
was Carlos theJackal,

334
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,089
I would've had an easier time
tracking her down.

335
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:39,289
There's no birth certificate,
no social security number, nothing.

336
00:30:39,365 --> 00:30:42,493
Better known to the world
as Jane Doe, 6149.

337
00:30:42,568 --> 00:30:45,298
Well, her name shows up
once in the records...

338
00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:49,102
of a Vista Inoculation Program
in 1981.

339
00:30:49,174 --> 00:30:52,871
- The Allegheny Mountains
of West Virginia.
- Deepest Appalachia.

340
00:30:52,945 --> 00:30:55,038
That's when her father,
one Oral Peattie,

341
00:30:55,114 --> 00:30:58,049
refused to allow her to be
inoculated against polio.

342
00:30:58,117 --> 00:31:02,349
But there's no address for him.
There's no record of him whatsoever.

343
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:08,159
Mulder, why are we
exhuming this girl?

344
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:11,993
Well, I'm thinking of her
dear old backwoods dad...

345
00:31:12,064 --> 00:31:13,998
and where he gets
all his graveyard dirt.

346
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:18,534
Here?
His daughter's grave?

347
00:31:18,604 --> 00:31:20,697
The occultist we spoke to
said that the person...

348
00:31:20,773 --> 00:31:23,606
casting these magic spells
was charmed.

349
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:26,143
That he had a source of power
that was very meaningful to him...

350
00:31:26,211 --> 00:31:28,679
and he kept it close by.

351
00:31:28,747 --> 00:31:30,681
Lynette Peattie's body?

352
00:31:30,749 --> 00:31:32,683
That's my guess.

353
00:31:32,751 --> 00:31:36,448
So as long as her body remains here
resting in peace in the Bay Area,

354
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:38,456
he remains powerful.

355
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:40,458
But if we were to
ship it off to Quantico...

356
00:31:50,936 --> 00:31:52,870
Hold onto that.

357
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:08,112
Mr. Peattie?

358
00:32:08,187 --> 00:32:10,121
Mr. Peattie,
my pain's back.

359
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:12,783
I was wondering if I could get
a little more of that poultice.

360
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:15,793
Mr. Peattie?

361
00:32:42,821 --> 00:32:44,755
Oh, I'm sorry.

362
00:32:44,823 --> 00:32:47,383
I didn't know you were home.

363
00:33:06,345 --> 00:33:09,371
All right, thank you.
They'll be there before dark.

364
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:11,882
- You all set?
- We still don't know
where it is we're going.

365
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:15,283
We rented a cabin for you. It's
important that you get out of town.

366
00:33:15,354 --> 00:33:17,822
And you believe by our leaving
it will somehow weaken him?

367
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,552
Well, what's important
is that he believes that.

368
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:23,356
At any rate, if he can't find you,
he can't hurt you.

369
00:33:23,428 --> 00:33:25,658
How do you know
he'll come forward?

370
00:33:25,731 --> 00:33:28,325
Because he hasn't gotten
everything he wants.

371
00:34:05,904 --> 00:34:08,998
Our ownJohn Gillness is on the scene.

372
00:34:09,074 --> 00:34:11,702
San Mateo County health
officials admit they're at a loss...

373
00:34:11,777 --> 00:34:16,942
to explain the sudden onset of the
56-year-old woman's bizarre illness,

374
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:19,779
but insist there is
no cause for alarm.

375
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:22,786
- Pretty weird, huh?
- There's been no official diagnosis.

376
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:25,721
Sources say they believe
the woman contracted...

377
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:29,352
the rare but deadly
Group 'A"Streptococcus...

378
00:34:29,428 --> 00:34:33,228
- Better known as
the flesh-eating disease.
- Freakin' scary.

379
00:34:33,298 --> 00:34:36,324
We will keep a close watch
on this story and any new developments.

380
00:34:43,575 --> 00:34:45,509
Bathroom's clear!

381
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:49,813
Clear here!

382
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,500
- Scully.
- Peattie may be on to us.

383
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:13,003
- What happened?
- I found out where he lives,

384
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:15,505
only he's cleared out and
he's taken his magic charm with him.

385
00:35:15,574 --> 00:35:17,508
At least as much of it
as he can carry.

386
00:35:17,576 --> 00:35:19,510
My guess is
he's looking for you.

387
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:21,773
I didn't see
anybody following us.

388
00:35:21,847 --> 00:35:24,213
Well, just keep an eye out,
Scully. I'm on my way.

389
00:35:24,283 --> 00:35:26,217
Okay.

390
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:58,383
Soon.

391
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,384
Very soon.

392
00:36:33,051 --> 00:36:34,985
What was that?

393
00:36:39,624 --> 00:36:41,558
Stay where you are.

394
00:37:52,497 --> 00:37:56,160
Oh! Oh, God!

395
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:59,067
- Oh!
- What is it?

396
00:37:59,137 --> 00:38:01,628
I don't know.

397
00:38:01,706 --> 00:38:03,901
I can't...

398
00:38:10,315 --> 00:38:14,183
- I can't see!

399
00:38:14,252 --> 00:38:16,812
- Agent Scully!
- Just stay where you are.

400
00:38:16,888 --> 00:38:18,822
Stay down.

401
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,100
- Oh, Doctor!
- Leave him alone!

402
00:38:39,177 --> 00:38:41,475
- Daddy!
- Get back!

403
00:38:41,546 --> 00:38:43,514
Get back!

404
00:38:43,581 --> 00:38:46,209
Don't make me hurt you!

405
00:38:46,284 --> 00:38:50,653
Can hurt the man
that ain't got nothin'left.

406
00:38:50,722 --> 00:38:53,316
You know who I be now?

407
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:58,618
Maybe you can recollect
my daughter.

408
00:38:58,696 --> 00:39:02,291
I remember!
I never forgot!

409
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:05,961
I'm-I'm sorry for your loss,

410
00:39:06,037 --> 00:39:09,734
but I did everything
humanly possible to save her!

411
00:39:09,808 --> 00:39:12,174
The arrogant little man.

412
00:39:12,243 --> 00:39:14,711
I did everything I could!

413
00:39:14,779 --> 00:39:17,543
And when I couldn't do anymore,
I eased her suffering!

414
00:39:17,615 --> 00:39:19,549
By killin' her.

415
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:23,310
If I be there,

416
00:39:23,388 --> 00:39:25,322
I save her!

417
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,858
You weren't there!

418
00:39:30,562 --> 00:39:34,828
Scary death in some field.

419
00:39:34,899 --> 00:39:37,163
No name on her,

420
00:39:37,235 --> 00:39:39,999
far away from her people.

421
00:39:40,071 --> 00:39:42,005
It wouldn't be right.

422
00:39:43,641 --> 00:39:47,407
So now, little man,

423
00:39:47,478 --> 00:39:51,676
I gonna show you
what be possible.

424
00:39:51,749 --> 00:39:53,842
I'm gonna show you...

425
00:39:53,918 --> 00:39:56,216
an eye for an eye.

426
00:39:56,287 --> 00:39:58,619
You're not gonna hurt
my daughter!

427
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,885
Daddy!

428
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:06,630
Baby.

429
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:19,700
- Daddy! Daddy!

430
00:40:19,777 --> 00:40:22,610
Doctor?
What's happening?

431
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,307
- Daddy!

432
00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:26,475
Dr. Wieder!

433
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:51,470
- You're killing him!

434
00:40:54,345 --> 00:40:56,176
Daddy!

435
00:41:00,184 --> 00:41:03,244
Stop! Daddy!

436
00:41:03,321 --> 00:41:06,586
- Daddy!

437
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:24,764
Daddy.

438
00:41:54,038 --> 00:41:57,997
Lynette Peattie's body is on its way
back home to O'Neal, West Virginia.

439
00:42:00,611 --> 00:42:03,136
She's going back
to her people after all.

440
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,882
You know, Mulder,
I would have made the same call.

441
00:42:14,525 --> 00:42:17,221
As a doctor,

442
00:42:17,295 --> 00:42:19,354
if I was certain that
I couldn't save her life...

443
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:22,399
and she was in
that much pain,

444
00:42:22,467 --> 00:42:25,231
- I would've done what Wieder did.
- Mm-hmm.

445
00:42:25,303 --> 00:42:27,567
It seems
pretty clear cut.

446
00:42:27,638 --> 00:42:30,732
Except maybe it's not.

447
00:42:32,977 --> 00:42:35,912
You're wondering if maybe
Peattie could've saved her life?

448
00:42:53,431 --> 00:42:55,365
You do keep me guessing.
