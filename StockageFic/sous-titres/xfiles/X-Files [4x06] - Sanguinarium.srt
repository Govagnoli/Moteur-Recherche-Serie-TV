00:00:07,521 --> 00:00:10,081
[Woman]
Miss Holland, I'm Nurse Waite.

2
00:00:10,157 --> 00:00:12,887
I'll be assisting
in your procedure.

3
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:14,893
Is it going to hurt?

4
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:17,259
You won't feel a thing.
There isn't even any blood.

5
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:20,528
Dr. Lloyd's done over
a thousand lipo procedures.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,932
You're in good hands.

7
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:27,466
[Orderly]
Okay, here we go.

8
00:00:33,747 --> 00:00:37,183
I'm going to give you
a tranquilizer now, and then
right before the operation...

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,186
the doctor will give you injections
of saline and anesthetic.

10
00:00:41,254 --> 00:00:45,190
All you have to worry about
is buying a new wardrobe.

11
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:54,559
Your liposuction patient
is prepped and waiting in room five.

12
00:00:54,634 --> 00:00:57,262
-[Water Running]
- Fine. What else am I scheduled for?

13
00:00:57,337 --> 00:01:00,465
You've got a scalp reduction
and a blepharoplasty following.

14
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,474
Are they prepped?

15
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:05,534
- Um, no. Would you like--
- Get them ready, please.

16
00:01:05,612 --> 00:01:08,672
I'd like to move right along
this morning.

17
00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:10,716
Yes, Doctor.

18
00:01:32,339 --> 00:01:35,934
[ Whirring ]

19
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:16,715
How are you doing?

20
00:02:16,783 --> 00:02:19,047
Is the doctor
going to be much longer?

21
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:22,054
I think my tranquilizer's
starting to wear off.

22
00:02:22,122 --> 00:02:25,455
I'm sorry.
I-I don't know where--

23
00:02:58,358 --> 00:02:59,723
Dr. Lloyd!

24
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:05,932
I think this patient
is finished.

25
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:55,879
What else do you call it?

26
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:59,544
When you're in your body
and out of it at the same time...

27
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:02,179
without the ability
to control your actions...

28
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:06,419
to stop yourself from doing
what I did to that poor man?

29
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:10,152
What else do you call it?

30
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,563
Spirit possession
or demon possession?

31
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:16,625
While the semental states have been
well documented through out history...

32
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:19,261
they've been much maligned--
rightly or wrongly--

33
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:22,967
and haven't held up in court well
as a criminal defense.

34
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:25,738
I reiterate that I have advised
my client against speaking to you.

35
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:31,011
I'd appreciate it if you would direct
any legal discussion to counsel.

36
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:34,986
Dr. Lloyd, are you currently
taking any kind of medication?

37
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:39,389
The occasional sleeping pill and
a prescription antacid for my stomach.

38
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:42,087
Would you mind allowing me
to check the dosage and which ones?

39
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:46,496
No, I really--
I would like to know why.

40
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:49,763
I think you've gotten a clear picture
of my client's story...

41
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:52,531
and his willingness to go along
with your investigation.

42
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:57,209
Yes, I believe we have.

43
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:01,876
Dr. Lloyd, you say that
you've taken sleeping pills.

44
00:05:01,948 --> 00:05:04,212
How much sleep did you get
the night before?

45
00:05:08,955 --> 00:05:12,356
I, um-- I can't recall.

46
00:05:22,202 --> 00:05:25,729
- The sleeping pill he was taking
was something called Somanil.
- I've heard of it.

47
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,433
It's popular because it works directly
on the central nervous system...

48
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,635
and it isn't stored in body tissue
past its intended use.

49
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:34,305
But it's also vety controversial
for its addictiveness...

50
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:36,645
and its effect
on long-term behavior.

51
00:05:36,716 --> 00:05:41,653
What was the date
of Dr. Lloyd's prescription?

52
00:05:41,721 --> 00:05:44,849
He started taking the drug
five years ago, and he went through--

53
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:49,361
Oh, he took a lot of it:
19100-tablet refills.

54
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:53,361
- Wow.
-[Scully] Yeah.

55
00:05:58,304 --> 00:06:00,363
That's more than a pill a day.

56
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:02,338
An addiction, in other words.

57
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:06,675
An addiction which very well could have
altered his ability to do his job.

58
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:09,442
How many of these procedures
would you say Dr. Lloyd's performed?

59
00:06:09,516 --> 00:06:12,383
Judging from his schedule
the day of the accident...

60
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:14,716
hundreds and probably thousands.

61
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:16,881
And not one fatality.

62
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:18,890
You're missing
my point here, Mulder.

63
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,085
This place is a veritable factory.

64
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:24,221
Cosmetic surgery is the boom industry
of the medical world.

65
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:27,733
A.S.U. wards like this
are a gold mine.

66
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:30,395
Every body's doing it, so I hear.

67
00:06:30,503 --> 00:06:35,133
A brand-new, state-of-the-art
facility like this can support
an entire hospital.

68
00:06:36,943 --> 00:06:40,344
- What do you suppose these are?
- What?

69
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:43,940
These five marks on your brand-new,
state-of-the-art floor.

70
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:47,953
They look like they were made
by the coasters from an O.R. table...

71
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:49,955
or some kind of equipment.

72
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:52,617
They look to me like
they were burned or scorched.

73
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:03,430
In the shape of a pentagram.

74
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:12,042
Mulder, if you want
to connect the dots here,
you should look at the facts.

75
00:07:12,112 --> 00:07:15,411
Iatrogenic deaths
or deaths due to doctor error...

76
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:18,417
are upwards of 80,000 a year.

77
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:20,510
Dr. Lloyd
was pushing his limits.

78
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:22,885
He was an accident
waiting to happen.

79
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:25,516
I'm not a doctor, Scully, but you've
got to be pushing pretty hard...

80
00:07:25,592 --> 00:07:28,527
to mistake a beer belly
for a bald head...

81
00:07:28,595 --> 00:07:31,063
not to mention
door number three.

82
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:41,773
It's amazing that no one
saw him in time to stop him.

83
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:43,900
Maybe they were
all possessed.

84
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,444
I don't think it's just
a simple possession, Scully.

85
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:51,075
I think it's more like sorcery
or black magic or something like that.

86
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:54,143
Excuse me. What kind
of procedure is that up there?

87
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,950
It's a rhinoplasty.
I'm sorry, who are you?

88
00:07:57,023 --> 00:08:00,618
We're with the F.B.I. I'm Agent Scully
and this is Agent Mulder.

89
00:08:00,693 --> 00:08:02,957
We're investigating
apatient's death here.

90
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:05,259
Oh, uh, yes.

91
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:09,062
You're Rebecca Waite.
You were the attending nurse
at the time. Am I correct?

92
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:12,434
- Yes.
- Can you explain to me
what happened with Dr. Lloyd...

93
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,973
how a mistake like this
could happen?

94
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,067
No. No, I can't really.

95
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:20,510
I wasn't in the O.R.
at the time...

96
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,949
and it's difficult
for me in my position.

97
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:28,510
Did you observe Dr. Lloyd
at all before the accident?

98
00:08:28,588 --> 00:08:32,024
I helped prep the patient.
I was supposed to assist.

99
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:34,389
I did my job as a nurse.

100
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,794
Are you aware that Dr. Lloyd is claiming
he was possessed during the incident?

101
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:46,935
I guess it's cheaper
than malpractice insurance.

102
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:54,272
Give him 500 c.c.s of Ringer's
wide open before he goes to recovery.

103
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:57,612
- I need you to keep up with me here.
- Right away, Dr. Shannon.

104
00:08:57,684 --> 00:09:00,118
Dr. Shannon, can we have
a word with you, please?

105
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:03,053
I'm sorry. I've got
a patient who can't wait.

106
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,855
There's magic
going on here, Mulder...

107
00:09:10,964 --> 00:09:15,560
only it's being done with silicone,
collagen and a well-placed scalpel.

108
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,277
[Man]
What we have to do here is keep calm...

109
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,978
and do nothing
out of the ordinary.

110
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:36,453
The appearance here
of any dissembling or impropriety...

111
00:09:36,522 --> 00:09:38,956
will only deepen
the F.B.I.'s probe...

112
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:41,493
on top of Dr. Lloyd's
insurance investigation.

113
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:44,394
Dr. Lloyd has made us a target.

114
00:09:44,497 --> 00:09:47,364
The last thing we need
is to be caught up in an expose.

115
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:49,367
Then they start looking
at our books again.

116
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:53,701
It's bad enough we have to explain why
buttock liposculptures cost 4,000 a pop.

117
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:57,368
We look greedy,
therefore we look guilty.

118
00:09:57,443 --> 00:10:01,743
We haven't done anything wrong,
Dr. Ilaqua.

119
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:04,214
If we give any credence
or credibility to Dr. Lloyd's story...

120
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:06,252
they're gonna burn us
at the stake.

121
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:10,949
What about the other personnel?
They were talking to the nurse-- Waite.

122
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:14,425
She can't tell them anything...

123
00:10:14,527 --> 00:10:17,189
because she doesn't know anything.

124
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,967
I can't feel my feet.

125
00:10:24,037 --> 00:10:28,997
I'm having a skin peel,
but I can't feel my feet.

126
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:31,236
It's okay. It's okay.

127
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:33,871
Your feet are still there.
They aren't going anywhere.

128
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:37,178
It's-- It's just...

129
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,344
I'm afraid to be put to sleep.

130
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,082
[ Sighs ]
What if I don't wake up?

131
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:45,852
Not to worry. Not to worry.

132
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:48,359
I want you to relax...

133
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:52,522
and think about
your beautiful new face.

134
00:10:52,632 --> 00:10:55,692
You're in good hands.

135
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:03,438
We're going to protect you.

136
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,975
[Knocking]

137
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:18,485
- You wanted to show me something?
- Yeah, a video tape.

138
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,387
This video of the operation
shows that the five marks
delineating the pentagram...

139
00:11:24,497 --> 00:11:26,988
were in evidence prior
to the patient's death.

140
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,034
Stop it a second.

141
00:11:30,536 --> 00:11:34,131
My God, he basically stabbed
the man to death in his sleep.

142
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:36,141
Which only underscores
the strangeness.

143
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:40,145
A sane man acting under his own volition
could never perform such an act.

144
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:44,206
Look. There.

145
00:11:44,283 --> 00:11:47,480
Presuming that has
anything to do with this,
who would have put them there?

146
00:11:47,553 --> 00:11:50,716
I don't know. A pentagram
is supposed to be a symbol of
protection and positive power...

147
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,758
used to control
the elemental forces.

148
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:55,988
- Then it doesn't make sense.
- But it does make sense
that witch craft...

149
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:58,586
would find a theater
in a place like this...

150
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:00,632
preying on the weak
and vainglorious.

151
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,828
But there's no other evidence
of anything like witchcraft
taking place here.

152
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:08,169
Maybe there is. What was that
prescription that Dr. Lloyd was taking?

153
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:12,337
- The sleeping pills?
- No, the stomach antacid.
Read me what it's made from.

154
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:19,278
"An antispasmodic
whose active ingredients
include belladonna alkaloids--"

155
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:22,549
It's also known as Witch's Berty.
That's an herb used in hexing rituals.

156
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:26,023
Mulder, do you know how many
pharmaceuticals listed in
the P.D.R. contain belladonna?

157
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:28,617
Yeah, just one;
the one Dr. Lloyd was taking.

158
00:12:28,694 --> 00:12:33,563
If it's that simple,
why don't you put out an A.P.B.
for someone riding a broom?

159
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:36,602
You jest, Scully,
but there's a good chance...

160
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:40,105
that this hex or ritual
or whatever it is may not be finished.

161
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:50,808
The F.B.I. seems to have backed off,
at least for the time being.

162
00:12:50,883 --> 00:12:53,317
- Yes.
- Are you finished for the day?

163

by the craving for non food objects
like clay, rocks, glue.
