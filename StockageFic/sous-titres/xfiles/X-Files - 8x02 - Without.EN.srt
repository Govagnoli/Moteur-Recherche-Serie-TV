1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,600
We live in a darkness
of our own making...

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,000
...blind to a habitant world all
but unseen by us.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,200
A world of beings traveling
through time and space...

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,200
...imaginable to us only as
flights of fancy.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,000
Who are these beings we dare
to imagine but fear to accept?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,600
What dark work goes on inside
their impossible machines...

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,700
...cloaked from us by
invisible forces?

8
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,400
If they know our secrets, ...

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,900
...why can't we know theirs?

10
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,300
Stop it! Please!

11
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,200
Let me go! Stop it!

12
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,200
Let me go!
Let me go! 

13
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,800
Let the boy go!

14
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,800
Let him go, Mulder!

15
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,000
Let him go, or I will be
compelled to use my weapon.

16
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Now, I don't want to do that,
Agent Mulder. I don't want to shoot.  

17
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,600
Now, are you armed?

18
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,000
Come on, damn it.
This is just stupid, Agent Mulder.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,300
Don't turn this into a movie.
Just tell me if you've got a gun.

20
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,200
It's too hot for this B.S.

21
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,300
All right, then, lie down.

22
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,500
Lie down on the ground.
Keep your hands out.

23
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,400
Lay down on your belly there.

24
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,800
For crying out loud,
what are you doing?

25
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,800
Agent Mulder, stay there!

26
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,400
He went over!
Over the edge!

27
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,200
Who?

28
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,300
Mulder.

29
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,500
Right, I'll talk to Scully.
You guys head back to the school.

30
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,500
Where is he?
Where's Mulder?

31
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,200
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

32
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,000
I heard an agent say over
the radio that you saw him.

33
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,500
Oh, yeah, I saw him. I saw him
back right off that cliff there...

34
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,100
...and I saw him fall
right over there.

35
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,200
- Then where is he?
- He's gone.

36
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,700
- Come on, he can't be gone.
- Yeah, he can't be, but he is.

37
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,500
That cliff there?
He fell from there?

38
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,300
It's impossible a fall like that.

39
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,400
A cop sees things.

40
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,900
A man drops five stories, dusts his
hat off and goes back to work.

41
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,300
An old lady gets shot point-blank
in a Chinese restaurant, ...

42
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,600
...plucks the slug out of her
egg foo young.

43
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,600
But even if Mulder survives this,
what he does then is too much.

44
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,200
You got your point of impact
there where Agent Scully is standing...

45
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,700
...clear and identifiable.

46
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,200
And a set of tracks here
leading down to the wash.

47
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,100
Look at these tracks.
What do you see?

48
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Mulder was running.

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It wasn't Mulder.

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,900
That's the one thing I'm sure of.

51
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,000
It may have looked like Mulder,
but it wasn't Mulder.

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,300
I told you I knew Mulder.

53
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,600
Okay, maybe I didn't know him
that well.

54
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,700
But I know who it was up there,
and it was Fox Mulder.

55
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,100
I'm sure it did look like Mulder, ...

56
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,900
...and you have every reason
to believe that it was him...

57
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,900
...but it was not Mulder.

58
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,500
I told you that I've seen things...

59
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,200
Things that I can't explain.

60
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,300
Well, I have seen what
looks like a man...

61
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,700
...transform into another man.

62
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,700
What looks like a man,
but who's not a man?

63
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,900
- So, what is he?
- You don't want to know.

64
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,800
He's not a man?
What the hell is he?

65
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,200
Hey, don't turn your back on me.
I'm asking you a legitimate question.

66
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,000
He's alien.

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,100
He's a bounty hunter.

68
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,300
Looking to collect a bounty on...?

69
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,300
On Gibson Praise...

70
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,700
...because he's part alien.

71
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,700
He's a human anomaly.

72
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,500
So, this alien bounty hunter...

73
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,900
...he disguised himself as Mulder
to come out here and grab the boy?

74
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,900
To take him back to his ship...

75
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,300
...where we believe Mulder is.

76
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,700
You know,
Agent Scully you're, uh, ...

77
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,900
...you're starting to remind me a lot
of Agent Mulder yourself.

78
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,700
Well then, you explain it to me.

79
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,400
If it's true or possible, ...

80
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,600
...what you're saying--
that there's someone like this out there, ...

81
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,600
...this bounty hunter--
he could just become anyone.

82
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,400
You, me, any damn one of us.

83
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,400
I think that it is true.

84
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,500
And possible.

85
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,400
And wherever Mulder is right now...

86
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,800
...he better damn well be smiling.

87
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,600
Right. They're here.  

88
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Any sign of him? Mulder?

89
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,700
Not according to these people.

90
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,600
We went through the school.  

91
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,800
- You're better than this.
- Sir?

92
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,700
He's got to be here somewhere.

93
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,100
Let's search the school again.

94
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,900
Hello?

95
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,200
Sorry, I thought you were...

96
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,200
I thought they cleared
you out of here.

97
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Find something?

98
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,100
No. Let's keep looking.

99
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,700
<i>- Administration building is clear.</i>
- Copy, check it again.

100
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,700
What I want to know is
how Doggett got out here.

101
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,300
How did he even know
where we were going?

102
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,600
I don't know.

103
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,400
But he's going to turn this place
upside down looking for the wrong person.

104
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,100
What happened to Gibson Praise?

105
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,500
Whatever happened to him,
he's long gone.

106
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Wherever he is,
he's three steps ahead of us.

107
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,300
Don't look now but we've
got a pair of eyeballs on us.

108
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,300
Just start walking,
I'll be right behind you.

109
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,600
Can I talk to you for a minute?

110
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
You shouldn't have come here.

111
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,100
You shouldn't have come.
You'll lead them to me.

112
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,200
I'm here to protect you, Gibson.

113
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,100
I know you know that's
the truth.

114
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,700
I know you know my thoughts.

115
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,800
I know they took the man
you work with ... Mulder.

116
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,300
And now, they've come to take me.

117
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,000
The only reason they want
to take you, Gibson...

118
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,900
...is because you're a special boy.

119
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,700
They want to take you
because of what you are.

120
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,100
I'm sorry. I didn't know that
someone was following me.

121
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,900
My friend Thea knows.

122
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,700
She's the only one
at school I've told.

123
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,700
She says the FBI is
looking for me, too.

124
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,600
She's afraid for me.

125
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,100
She has a right to be afraid.

126
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,800
We don't know who to trust now.

127
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,200
I fell when I was running away.

128
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,700
I think you might
have broken it, Gibson.

129
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,400
If they find me,
they'll take me. I know it.

130
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,200
I've always known it.

131
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,400
I'm going to make you
a splint, Gibson, okay?

132
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,800
I can set your leg,
but, uh...

133
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,100
I'm going to need a car
to get you out of here.

134
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,400
I'm going to come back
for you.

135
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,900
I promise.

136
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,200
I'm not going to let anything
bad happen to you.

137
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,200
You said that to me
once before.

138
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah?
Deputy Director, for you.

139
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,200
Yeah, this is John Doggett.

140
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,100
Agent Doggett,
I'm getting reports from Arizona...

141
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

142
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,200
...That you found Agent Mulder.

143
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,900
I'm afraid somebody jumped the gun
on that. I saw him, sir, but I...

144
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,300
<i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>you saw him?</i>

145
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,800
What the hell is going on
out there?

146
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,200
Well, we're 'round the
clock here.

147
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,600
I've got local SAR, a rolling
ground cordon and an eye in the sky.

148
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,900
- We're on top of the situation.
- How does the FBI...

149
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:17,700
...find a man and then lose him
in the middle of the desert?

150
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,000
'Cause I'd like to know.

151
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
<i>- Agent Doggett, are you there?</i>
- Yeah. I heard the question.

152
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,400
<i>I put you in charge</i>
<i>out there, Doggett.</i>

153
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,400
Now do the damn job.

154
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,200
This amuse you?
I amuse you?

155
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,000
No.

156
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,300
It just made sense to me.

157
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,300
How you found your way out here.
Who led you to Gibson Praise.

158
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,100
You think I was spying on you?

159
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,800
No, but I think our new
Deputy Director was.

160
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,800
You're being made a pawn
in a rigged game.

161
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,100
All right, you've painted me the picture,
now put it in a frame.

162
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,800
All right.

163
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,000
You've got a good rep,
Agent Doggett.

164
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,300
You don't compromise,
you don't quit.

165
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,300
You're a damned good FBI agent--
best of the best.

166
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,600
Lot of guys put you in the
Director's chair one day.

167
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,200
Which is why you've been
set up to fail.

168
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,600
There's no amount of search and
rescue or rolling cordons...

169
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,700
...or eyes in the sky that are
going to turn up Mulder.

170
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,500
It's just the wrong approach.

171
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,000
It's not a question of approach.
It's the only approach I got.

172
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,400
The only way you're going to
find Mulder is to give into the truth.

173
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,600
To listen to Scully.

174
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,700
But even then...
say you did find him, ...

175
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,500
...even then you lose.

176
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,400
You put anything about
aliens or...

177
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,600
...UFOs or alien bounty hunters
in your report...

178
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,300
...Kersh will ruin you.

179
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,700
I'm betting that was his plan.

180
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,600
Is Agent Scully here?

181
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,100
Where's Agent Scully?

182
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,400
I need someone who's with
Agent Scully to put her on a radio.

183
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,900
Someone... with Agent Scully.

184
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,400
<i>Anyone got a twenty</i>
<i>on Agent Scully?</i>

185
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,300
<i>Is anyone out there with her?</i>

186
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,800
I'm with Agent Scully.

187
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,300
Then who's this?

188
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,500
<i>Go for Agent Scully.</i>

189
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What?

190
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,900
Give me the radio.

191
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,700
- You're with Scully?
- Right across the room from her.

192
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,800
From who? From me?

193
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,600
Where?  

194
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,800
- What room? Where are you?
- <i>Bunkhouse.</i>

195
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,200
We're in the dorm.

196
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,300
Tell him to hold her.

197
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,300
Tell them not to let
her out of his sight!

198
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,800
Hold Scully.
We're coming to you.

199
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,700
Agent Scully--

200
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
There she is.

201
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,000
Do you see her?

202
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,100
Where did she go?
Did you see her?

203
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,500
No.

204
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,300
She ran right back here!

205
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,300
I saw her!

206
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,800
You saw her!

207
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,800
Agent...  Can you breathe?

208
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,300
He thinks it was me.

209
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,700
He thinks that I did
this to him.

210
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,400
How is that possible?

211
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's someone in this room.

212
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,300
Agent Scully?

213
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,400
Where are you going?

214
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,300
Agent Scully?

215
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,000
Get out of the car.

216
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
Agent Scully!

217
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,900
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

218
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,100
Drop your weapon and
turn around.

219
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,100
- I'm not gonna turn around.
- Just do it!

220
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,100
I know how it works--

221
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,000
Kill shot to the back
of the neck.

222
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,800
Scully, you're pointing
your weapon at a friend.

223
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,100
Turn around, ...

224
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,600
...or I'm going to assume that
you're not who you say you are.

225
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,100
Scully, it's me!
Skinner!

226
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,700
I can prove it.

227
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,300
I know your secret--
who else knows it?

228
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,100
Okay...  then tell me.

229
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,800
You tell me.
How do I know it's you?

230
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,800
I don't like pointing guns
at pregnant women...

231
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,100
...any more than I like them
pointing guns at me.

232
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,800
This has gone too far, Scully.

233
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,400
No.

234
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,800
That's what's wrong here.

235
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,200
It hasn't gone far enough.

236
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,800
I need those car keys.

237
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,700
And what do you think
you're going to do?

238
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,000
Look, we are being
hampered here by the FBI, ...

239
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
...by John Doggett, by doubt,
by our own mistrust.

240
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,200
Whatever it is, it is working...
as long as we let it.

241
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,700
You told me Mulder wouldn't
allow it.

242
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:41,700
Wouldn't let me ruin my career
over this. Over him.

243
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,400
But what about you, Scully?

244
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,000
I mean, my God,
you've got even more at stake.

245
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,900
I can't take the chance that
I'm never going to see him again.

246
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,800
Mulder could just come walking out
of the dark-- we don't know.

247
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,900
Look... we've got one last
chance here...

248
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,200
...waiting for us out there
in the desert--

249
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,000
Gibson Praise.

250
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,700
It may just be who
gets to him first.

251
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Get in the car.
I'll drive.

252
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,100
Gibson!

253
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,600
He's not down there.

254
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,200
I told him to stay here.

255
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,600
He was supposed to stay here.

256
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,700
I found him.

257
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,900
What are you doing
out here?

258
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,900
Why didn't you answer me, huh?

259
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,000
He's here.

260
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,800
I hear him.

261
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,200
What are you talking about?

262
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,500
Mulder.

263
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,700
He's somewhere out there.

264
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,300
He's got a really bad fever.

265
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,400
I think his leg might
be infected.

266
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,600
All right, we got to get you
to the hospital, okay, buddy?

267
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,600
You're so close now.

268
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,600
I'll carry you.

269
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Put your arm around
my neck. Watch your legs.

270
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,700
Agent Scully.

271
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,700
- You take him to the hospital.
- What about you?

272
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,100
I got a boy here who needs
emergency medical attention!

273
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,700
What?

274
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,200
Are you okay?
What's wrong?

275
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,500
It's okay, Gibson,
lie down. Lie down.

276
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,200
Oh, my God.

277
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,200
For someone who claims
he's not following me, ...

278
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,500
...you sure have a knack.

279
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,300
- Hey, you're where the action is.
- What does that tell you?

280
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,600
That I'm crazy or that I'm right?

281
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,600
Wandering around in the desert
in the dead of night, you call it.

282
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,100
You say you want to find Mulder
but you won't do what it takes.

283
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,800
- You're afraid that I'm right.
- I'm not afraid of anything.

284
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,300
Except that maybe Mulder's got
even you believing in this crap now.

285
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,300
You've seen this crap
for yourself now.

286
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:22,300
How do you explain what
took place today?

287
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,100
Let me ask you something
hypothetically.

288
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,200
If you were to find him
out here...

289
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,600
...or this ship or this
alien bounty hunter, ...

290
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,300
...what would you do then?

291
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,000
I know what Agent Mulder would do.

292
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,200
- He'd do whatever it took.
- You mean lie.

293
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,000
Like you've been lying to me.

294
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,600
And flout orders like
you've done...

295
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,300
...every step of the way
on this thing.

296
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,600
Is that what it takes, Agent Scully?

297
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,700
Give a little, get a little,
Agent Doggett!

298
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,900
You knew where the kid was, ...

299
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,800
...you knew where the kid was
and you wouldn't tell me-- why?

300
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,600
- What kid? I don't see any kid.
- You're lying to me again!

301
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,000
Assistant Director Skinner took
him from here to the hospital.

302
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,800
How do you know that?

303
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,000
There's one thing I know
for sure in this case...

304
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,600
...and that's that Mulder is
after this boy Gibson Praise.

305
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Why? It beats the
hell out of me.

306
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,600
But when he goes after that kid,
my men are going to be waiting for him.

307
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:27,900
Your men... followed
Assistant Director Skinner?

308
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,400
Hey, where you going?

309
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,900
- Agent Scully, where you going?
- Your men are at the hospital?

310
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,900
They got it controlled.

311
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,900
Nobody goes in or out of that
building without them knowing about it.

312
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:45,900
How do you know that
they're your men?

313
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,600
Where's the boy?

314
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,600
Door at the end of the hall,
with AD Skinner.

315
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,100
Are you certain about that?

316
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,400
Why don't you get yourself
a visual in the exterior window.

317
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,200
The night nurse has been checking
the boy every 20 minutes-- he's fine.  

318
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,400
We have hospital personnel going
about their business.

319
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
We're just laying back,
waiting for Mulder.

320
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,700
Yeah, every minute that you wait,
that boy's in danger.

321
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,200
He's exposed.

322
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,300
No one's getting past us,
Agent Scully.

323
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,600
No one's gotten past us.

324
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,600
You believe that, Agent Doggett?

325
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,000
Hey, if something tries to rip
your throat out, I got you covered.

326
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,700
A.D. Skinner...

327
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,000
This is John Doggett.

328
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,400
What the hell is this?

329
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,700
- What the hell is going on?!
- There's no one in that room.

330
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,100
I'm looking for a patient,
a boy, 12 years old.

331
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,800
He may still be in this building.

332
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,300
The window doesn't
even open.

333
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,800
How's a grown man and a boy get out
of the room except by that door?

334
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,000
Agent Scully.

335
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,900
It's okay, I've got him.
Gibson.

336
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,000
How did you get here?

337
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,300
How did you get him
out of that room?

338
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,400
We went up through the ceiling.

339
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,900
I don't know who to trust.

340
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,000
Where is he?

341
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,700
He's right here.

342
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,100
They're going to find him.

343
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,300
Agent Scully!

344
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,200
An agent needs help!

345
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,400
I said an agent needs help!

346
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:21,000
The best I can say is it's lucky
it all happened at a hospital.

347
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,200
Very lucky, yes, Sir.

348
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,300
I assume the hazardous
materials or chemicals...

349
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,800
...which caused this must
have been medical.

350
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,500
That has not yet been determined, Sir.

351
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,800
So much here is undetermined...

352
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,600
...as remain the whereabouts
of Mulder.

353
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,100
But some of your ... facts...

354
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,200
...like "a man falls from the
cliff and disappears..."

355
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,900
"An agent has his throat crushed
by an assailant...

356
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,500
...who vanishes into thin air."

357
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,700
This reads like a piece of
pot-boiled science fiction.

358
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,700
You mean it reads like an X-File.

359
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,900
But that's what you intended,
wasn't it, Sir?

360
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,800
When you assigned me to the case.

361
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,200
I'll ask the questions, John.

362
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,200
You just give me some
damn answers.

363
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,000
Don't come back until you do.

364
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,800
My dad always said it's
not who wins or loses...

365
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,300
...it's who takes the worst
beating that counts.

366
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,500
That supposed to cheer me up?  

367
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,600
I thought so.

368
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,600
But then I never did get
to see your opponent.

369
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,000
And you never will.

370
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,000
You still don't believe me.

371
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,500
What I don't believe is how long
they're keeping you here.

372
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,500
Oh, it's just some things they
have to check out...

373
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,100
...make sure of.

374
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:17,100
Well, I've got some things
I thought you'd want checked out.

375
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,100
A.D. Skinner is in stable condition, ...

376
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:24,200
...resting comfortably and awaiting
diagnosis and further study.

377
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,200
Ditto Agent Landau, his throat.

378
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,000
Gibson Praise is right now a
ward of the state...

379
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,900
...but I asked for special protections, ...

380
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,100
...as I assumed you would yourself.

381
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,100
What are you doing here,
Agent Doggett?

382
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,100
Keeping you apprised of the case.

383
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,600
That's not your job.

384
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,100
It is, actually.

385
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,800
And officially.

386
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,900
I'm...

387
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,400
...assigned now to the X-Files.

388
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,700
Whatever you and I
may differ on, ...

389
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,000
...I'll find him, Agent Scully.
