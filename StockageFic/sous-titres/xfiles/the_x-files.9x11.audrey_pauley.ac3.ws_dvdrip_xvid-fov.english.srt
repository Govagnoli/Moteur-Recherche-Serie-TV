[Sobbing]

349
00:37:17,292 --> 00:37:19,192
This is your hospital.

350
00:37:20,596 --> 00:37:22,496
It's you who created it.

351
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,530
It's all you, Audrey.

352
00:37:29,104 --> 00:37:31,504
This place is all you.

353
00:37:31,607 --> 00:37:33,666
And that means you can
make the rules work...

354
00:37:33,775 --> 00:37:36,642
any damn way
that you want them to.

355
00:37:40,616 --> 00:37:43,141
You can help me escape.

356
00:37:53,328 --> 00:37:55,228
Audrey?

357
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:22,889
You know, I've always wondered
what was down here.

358
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:31,593
I'm being accused
of things, Audrey.

359
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,294
Terrible things regarding
three patients of mine.

360
00:38:34,403 --> 00:38:37,736
Really, it's...
it's beyond the pale.

361
00:38:42,711 --> 00:38:44,838
[Sighs]

362
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:54,050
You're not going to yell out,
are you, Audrey?

363
00:39:02,264 --> 00:39:04,232
Audrey?

364
00:39:20,415 --> 00:39:22,883
Audrey?

365
00:39:22,984 --> 00:39:24,884
Audrey!

366
00:39:30,492 --> 00:39:33,120
Audrey, what's happening?

367
00:39:33,228 --> 00:39:36,095
You have to go.

368
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,747
This way.

369
00:39:57,219 --> 00:39:59,119
No.

370
00:40:03,091 --> 00:40:06,618
If I do that,
I'll burn up. I'll die.

371
00:40:06,728 --> 00:40:10,528
No. Not now.

372
00:40:10,632 --> 00:40:12,532
But you have to hurry.

373
00:40:14,302 --> 00:40:16,202
What about you?

374
00:40:18,573 --> 00:40:20,473
I know now.

375
00:40:23,612 --> 00:40:26,877
I know who told me
to build it.

376
00:40:26,982 --> 00:40:30,008

377
00:41:11,993 --> 00:41:14,052
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

378
00:41:23,371 --> 00:41:25,931
The transplant teams
are in place.

379
00:41:30,478 --> 00:41:32,639
They're not cutting her up.

380
00:41:35,016 --> 00:41:40,181
John... I'm still waiting
for your argument.

381
00:41:43,825 --> 00:41:46,123
If you have something
to convince me...

382
00:41:46,228 --> 00:41:49,720
to convince the doctors
that somehow she's alive.

383
00:41:51,299 --> 00:41:53,199
<i>[Reyes]</i>
<i>John.</i>

384
00:42:12,654 --> 00:42:15,054
Audrey.

385
00:42:24,299 --> 00:42:26,267
[Panting]

386
00:42:28,603 --> 00:42:30,594
Where you going, Doctor?

387
00:42:39,347 --> 00:42:42,475
Oh, God. Oh, no.

388
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:17,884
Good night.

389
00:43:17,986 --> 00:43:19,886
Good night.

390
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:30,857

<i>I made this.!</i>
