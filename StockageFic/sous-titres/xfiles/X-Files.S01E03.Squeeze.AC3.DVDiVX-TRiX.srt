00:01:36,482 --> 00:01:37,949
( phoneringing )

2
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,484
Woman:
Hi. You've reached
the Usher residence.

3
00:01:40,553 --> 00:01:42,748
Please leave a message
at the tone.

4
00:01:42,822 --> 00:01:44,119
( machinebeeps )

5
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,454
Hi, honey. lt's about 8:30.

6
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:48,823
l'm going to be here a while.

7
00:01:48,894 --> 00:01:50,987
The presentation
didn't go so well.

8
00:01:51,063 --> 00:01:51,995
Call me.

9
00:01:52,064 --> 00:01:53,622
l loveyou. Bye.

10
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:34,063
(yelling )

11
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:38,676
( loudthud )

12
00:04:09,168 --> 00:04:10,362
Guess who l ran into

13
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:12,130
from our class
at Quantico?

14
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:13,762
Marty Neil.

15
00:04:13,873 --> 00:04:15,898
j. Edgar,Jr.?

16
00:04:16,008 --> 00:04:17,066
just got bumped up.

17
00:04:17,176 --> 00:04:18,609
Foreign counterintelligence.

18
00:04:18,677 --> 00:04:20,144
New York City Bureau.

19
00:04:20,212 --> 00:04:22,612
Supervisory special agent.

20
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:23,739
Supervisory?

21
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:25,681
Twoyears
out ofthe academy?

22
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:27,446
How did he land that?

23
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,681
He lucked into
the Trade Center bombing.

24
00:04:29,755 --> 00:04:31,814
Well, good for Marty.

25
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:32,789
Come on, Dana.

26
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:33,950
The guy is a loser.

27
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:35,323
Lookwhere he is now.

28
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:36,952
lt's where we should be.

29
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:38,257
Brad Wilson told me

30
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,525
the psychological profile
you wrote

31
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:42,794
on the Washington
Crossing killer

32
00:04:42,902 --> 00:04:44,426
led them to the suspect.

33
00:04:44,537 --> 00:04:48,439
You're on the violent crime
section's fast track.

34
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,838
How areyou doing?

35
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:52,400
Haveyou had
any close encounters

36
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:53,978
ofthe third kind?

37
00:04:57,082 --> 00:04:59,482
ls that what everyone
thinks l do?

38
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:00,917
No, ofcourse not.

39
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:03,648
Butyou do work
with "Spooky" Mulder.

40
00:05:03,722 --> 00:05:06,282
Mulder's ideas
may be a bit out there

41
00:05:06,358 --> 00:05:08,053
but he is a great agent.

42
00:05:08,127 --> 00:05:10,857
Well, l've got this case
that's "out there."

43
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,194
Baltimore P.D. calls.

44
00:05:13,265 --> 00:05:17,861
Theywant our help
on a serial killer profile.

45
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,904
Three murders began
six weeks ago.

46
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:22,030
Victims vary in
age, race, gender.

47
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:23,836
No connection
to each other.

48
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:25,103
But there's a pattern.

49
00:05:25,177 --> 00:05:26,041
Point ofentry--

50
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:27,271
the lack ofone.

51
00:05:27,346 --> 00:05:28,745
What doyou mean?

52
00:05:28,814 --> 00:05:29,781
College girl

53
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:31,611
killed in her
cinder block dorm room

54
00:05:31,684 --> 00:05:33,208
found with
the windows locked

55
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:35,185
and the door chained
from the inside.

56
00:05:35,254 --> 00:05:38,223
The last incident,
two days ago.

57
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,814
High-security office building.

58
00:05:39,892 --> 00:05:41,154
Nothing on the monitors.

59
00:05:41,227 --> 00:05:44,253
janitor spoke to the victim
minutes before the murder.

60
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,298
Didn't hear or see a thing.

61
00:05:46,365 --> 00:05:47,923
Suicides?

62
00:05:52,972 --> 00:05:54,837
Each victim was found

63
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:56,966
with their liver ripped out.

64
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:00,010
No cutting tool was used.

65
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,273
Bare hands?

66
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:04,481
This looks like an X File.

67
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,142
Let's not get
carried away.

68
00:06:06,218 --> 00:06:08,482
l'm going to solve
these murders, but...

69
00:06:08,554 --> 00:06:11,352
l would likeyou
to go over the case histories.

70
00:06:11,423 --> 00:06:14,256
Maybe come down
to the crime scene.

71
00:06:14,326 --> 00:06:16,453
Doyou want me to ask Mulder?

72
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:19,986
Okay, ifhe wants to come
and doyou a favor, great

73
00:06:20,065 --> 00:06:24,764
but make sure he knows
this is my case.

74
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,964
Dana, ifl can break a case
like this one

75
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:30,735
l'll be getting my bump
up the ladder

76
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:32,208
and you?

77
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:36,409
Maybeyou won't have
to be Mrs. Spooky anymore.

78
00:06:39,151 --> 00:06:41,312
Mulder:
Why didn't theyaskme?

79
00:06:41,387 --> 00:06:43,480
Scully:
They're friends ofmine.

80
00:06:43,555 --> 00:06:45,386
Theyjust felt
more comfortable

81
00:06:45,457 --> 00:06:46,719
talking to me.

82
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:48,817
Whywould l make them
uncomfortable?

83
00:06:48,894 --> 00:06:52,227
lt probably has to do
with your reputation.

84
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:55,233
Reputation?
l have a reputation?

85
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:57,769
Colton plays by the book,
and you don't.

86
00:06:57,836 --> 00:07:00,498
They feel your methods,
your theories, are...

87
00:07:00,606 --> 00:07:01,903
Spooky?

88
00:07:03,776 --> 00:07:05,266
Doyou think l'm spooky?

89
00:07:05,377 --> 00:07:09,211
Man:
Agent Scully's
in here, sir.

90
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:10,873
Sorry l'm late.

91
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:12,814
Wejust got here.

92
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:16,685
Uh, Fox Mulder,
Tom... Colton.

93
00:07:16,755 --> 00:07:17,949
What doyou think?

94
00:07:18,023 --> 00:07:21,049
Does this look like the work
oflittle green men?

95
00:07:21,126 --> 00:07:22,093
Gray.

96
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:22,957
Excuse me?

97
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:24,723
Gray. You said green men.

98
00:07:24,797 --> 00:07:27,459
A Reticulan skin tone is gray.

99
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:29,433
They're notorious
for their extraction

100
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,503
ofterrestrial
human livers

101
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:34,265
due to iron depletion
in the Reticulum galaxy.

102
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:35,704
You can't be serious.

103
00:07:35,774 --> 00:07:39,141
Doyou have any idea what
liver and onions go for there?

104
00:07:39,211 --> 00:07:40,735
Excuse me.

105
00:07:47,252 --> 00:07:50,710
Dana, l've been
thinking about this

106
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:51,653
and l have a theory.

107
00:07:51,724 --> 00:07:53,248
lt might explain a lot.

108
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:54,849
Tell me
whatyou think.

109
00:07:54,927 --> 00:07:56,952
What ifthe guy enters...

110
00:08:09,942 --> 00:08:11,773
...Hold on a second.

111
00:08:11,844 --> 00:08:13,573
What in the hell's
he doing?

112
00:08:17,683 --> 00:08:20,311
Uh, that vent
is six inches by about 1 8.

113
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:24,083
Even ifa Reticulan
could crawl through

114
00:08:24,156 --> 00:08:26,181
it's screwed
in place.

115
00:08:31,897 --> 00:08:35,162
Mulder:
This is the print
from Usher's office.

116
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:37,930
These others are from an X File.

117
00:08:38,036 --> 00:08:39,594
Ten murders, Baltimore area.

118
00:08:39,705 --> 00:08:41,332
Undetermined points ofentry.

119
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,499
Each victim had
their liver removed.

120
00:08:43,609 --> 00:08:47,443
These prints were discovered
at five ofthe ten crime scenes.

121
00:08:47,513 --> 00:08:49,572
Ten murders.
Colton never mentioned...

122
00:08:49,648 --> 00:08:51,775
Most likely
he's unaware ofthem.

123
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,308
These two prints were lifted
fiveyears before he was born

124
00:08:55,387 --> 00:08:56,684
at Powhatan Mill.

125
00:08:56,755 --> 00:08:58,120
These three were lifted

126
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,284
probably fiveyears before
his motherwas even born.

127
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,520
Areyou saying

128
00:09:02,594 --> 00:09:05,563
these prints are from
the 1 960s and 1 930s?

129
00:09:05,631 --> 00:09:09,294
And fingerprinting wasjust
coming into its own in 1 903

130
00:09:09,401 --> 00:09:10,732
but there was a murder

131
00:09:10,836 --> 00:09:12,770
involving
an extracted liver.

132
00:09:12,838 --> 00:09:14,237
Ofcourse.

133
00:09:14,306 --> 00:09:17,443
Now, that's five murders
every 30 years

134
00:09:17,576 --> 00:09:18,634
so two more to go
this year.

135
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,541
You're saying
these are copycats?

136
00:09:20,612 --> 00:09:21,510
What did we learn

137
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,275
our first day
at the academy?

138
00:09:23,348 --> 00:09:24,940
Each fingerprint is unique.

139
00:09:25,017 --> 00:09:26,848
These are a perfect match.

140
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,011
Areyou suggesting

141
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:30,179
that l go before
the violent crimes section

142
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:32,814
and present a profile
declaring these murders

143
00:09:32,925 --> 00:09:34,051
are done by aliens?

144
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,627
l find no evidence
ofalien involvement.

145
00:09:36,695 --> 00:09:37,992
Well, what then?

146
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:40,054
This is the work
ofa 1 00-year-old killer

147
00:09:40,132 --> 00:09:42,862
capable ofoverpowering
a six-foot-two businessman?

148
00:09:42,935 --> 00:09:45,529
And he should
stick out in a crowd

149
00:09:45,604 --> 00:09:47,663
with ten inch fingers.

150
00:09:47,739 --> 00:09:49,138
Look, bottom line

151
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,436
this is Colton's case.

152
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:52,477
OurX File
dates back to 1 903.

153
00:09:52,544 --> 00:09:53,772
We had it first.

154
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:56,144
Mulder, they don't
wantyou involved.

155
00:09:56,215 --> 00:09:58,581
They don't want
to hearyour theories.

156
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:03,314
That's why Blevins has you
hidden away down here.

157
00:10:03,422 --> 00:10:04,889
You're down here too.

158
00:10:04,957 --> 00:10:07,016
Look, why don't
we agree to this?

159
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,150
They'll have their investigation

160
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:11,229
and we'll have ours, and never

161
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,957
the twain shall meet.

162
00:10:13,031 --> 00:10:14,623
Agreed?

163
00:10:18,504 --> 00:10:21,029
Scully:
Aftera carefulreview

164
00:10:21,106 --> 00:10:25,008
ofthe violenceandpowerful
nature ofthesemurders

165
00:10:25,077 --> 00:10:27,511

00:10:34,253 --> 00:10:36,517

orthathe, in fact,

172
00:10:44,296 --> 00:10:47,265
posing as delivery
ormaintenance workers.

173
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:01,569
the extraction oftheliver

174
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:07,017
is themostsignificantdetail
ofthese crimes.

175
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:09,918
Theliverpossesses
regenerative qualities.

176
00:11:10,022 --> 00:11:11,512
Itcleanses theblood.

177
00:11:11,623 --> 00:11:14,820
The taking ofthis trophy
is the transferring act

178
00:11:14,893 --> 00:11:17,088
for the killer
to cleanse himself

179
00:11:17,162 --> 00:11:18,561
ofhis own impurities.

180
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,428
l think he is acting
under the classic form

181
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,661
ofobsessive/compulsive
behavior.

182
00:11:23,735 --> 00:11:26,067
Now, since the victims
are unrelated

183
00:11:26,138 --> 00:11:28,606
and we cannot predict
who will be next

184
00:11:28,674 --> 00:11:30,301
we must utilize the fact

185
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,605
that a killer
will not always succeed

186
00:11:32,678 --> 00:11:33,940
in finding a victim.

187
00:11:34,012 --> 00:11:35,843
When this occurs,
a serial killer

188
00:11:35,914 --> 00:11:39,975
may return in frustration
to the site ofa previous murder

189
00:11:40,052 --> 00:11:43,044
hoping to recapture
the emotional high.

190
00:11:43,121 --> 00:11:44,179
l think our best
course ofaction

191
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:46,416
is to target these sites.

192
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:48,755
Goodjob,
Agent Scully.

193
00:11:48,827 --> 00:11:50,226
lfthere are no objections

194
00:11:50,295 --> 00:11:53,731
l'd like to begin our stakeouts
ofthe murder sites tonight.

195
00:11:53,832 --> 00:11:55,732
We're looking for a male,
25 to 35

196
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:59,066
possiblywearing a uniform--
gas company, U.P.S., whatever.

197
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:01,935
l knowyou're assigned
to another area, Scully

198
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:05,306
butyou're welcome to come
aboard with us on this.

199
00:12:05,377 --> 00:12:09,541
That is, ifyou don't mind
working in an area

200
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:11,845
that's a bit more down to earth.

201
00:12:25,797 --> 00:12:28,129
Man:
Position Ten, station check.

202
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,191
Position Ten, l copy.

203
00:12:32,938 --> 00:12:34,963
( metallicbanging )

204
00:12:52,758 --> 00:12:55,591
( running footsteps )

205
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:56,992
Whoa!

206
00:12:57,062 --> 00:12:59,030
You wouldn't shoot
an unarmed man

207
00:12:59,097 --> 00:13:00,155
would you, copper?

208
00:13:00,232 --> 00:13:01,494
What areyou doing here?

209
00:13:01,566 --> 00:13:02,726
He's not coming back.

210
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:04,928
His thrill is derived
from the challenge

211
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:06,732
ofa seemingly
impossible entry.

212
00:13:06,805 --> 00:13:08,500
He's already beaten
this place.

213
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:10,632
lfyou'd read the X File
on the case...

214
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:12,973
Mulder, you arejeopardizing
my stakeout.

215
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:14,637
Seeds?

216
00:13:14,713 --> 00:13:16,874
You're wasting your time.

217
00:13:16,948 --> 00:13:19,143
l'm going home.

218
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,983
( metallicbang )

219
00:13:50,348 --> 00:13:56,082
Scully! Call for backup,
and get over here!

220
00:13:57,322 --> 00:14:00,189
Position Ten requesting backup.

221
00:14:06,231 --> 00:14:07,755
ln there.

222
00:14:14,806 --> 00:14:16,535
( loudbang )

223
00:14:16,608 --> 00:14:18,439
Federal agent!

224
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,671
l'm armed.

225
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:23,408
Proceed down
the vent.

226
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:26,315
Slowly!

227
00:14:34,693 --> 00:14:36,524
( manyelling )

228
00:14:36,595 --> 00:14:38,529
She'snotbyhercar!

229
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:45,860
( running footsteps )

230
00:14:45,937 --> 00:14:47,131
Take him!

231
00:14:47,205 --> 00:14:48,297
F.B.l.!

232
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:49,635
Don't move!

233
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:50,834
Getyour hands up!

234
00:14:50,909 --> 00:14:52,376
Keep them up!

235
00:14:52,444 --> 00:14:53,934
You're under arrest.

236
00:14:54,012 --> 00:14:56,378
You have the right
to remain silent...

237
00:14:56,448 --> 00:14:57,915
You were right.

238
00:15:08,026 --> 00:15:12,122
ls your full name
Eugene VictorTooms?

239
00:15:12,197 --> 00:15:13,721
Yes.

240
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,236
Areyou a resident
ofthe state of Maryland?

241
00:15:18,303 --> 00:15:20,567
Yes.

242
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,334
Areyou an employee

243
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:25,968
ofthe Baltimore
Municipal Animal Control?

244
00:15:26,044 --> 00:15:28,012
Yes.

245
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,411
ls ityour intent
to lie to me

246
00:15:30,515 --> 00:15:33,916
about anything
here today?

247
00:15:33,985 --> 00:15:35,475
No.

248
00:15:35,587 --> 00:15:39,455
Wereyou ever enrolled
in college?

249
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:42,425
Yes.

250
00:15:42,494 --> 00:15:46,521
Wereyou ever enrolled
in medical school?

251
00:15:46,598 --> 00:15:48,293
No.

252
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:52,302
Haveyou ever removed
a liver

253
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,462
from a human being?

254
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:55,005
No.

255
00:15:55,073 --> 00:15:57,769
Haveyou ever killed
a living creature?

256
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:02,646
Yes.

257
00:16:02,714 --> 00:16:06,741
Haveyou ever killed
a human being?

258
00:16:06,852 --> 00:16:09,616
No.

259
00:16:09,688 --> 00:16:12,953
Wereyou ever in
George Usher's office?

260
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:15,754
No.

261
00:16:16,828 --> 00:16:19,092
Did you kill
George Usher?

262
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:22,726
No.

263
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:25,827
Areyou over
1 00 years old?

264
00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:27,462
That must be
a control question.

265
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:28,836
l had her ask it.

266
00:16:28,907 --> 00:16:30,499
No.

267
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:35,811
Haveyou ever been
to Powhatan Mill?

268
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:37,075
Yes.

269
00:16:37,182 --> 00:16:39,150
ln 1 933?

270
00:16:42,954 --> 00:16:44,353
No.

271
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:49,987
Areyou afraid
you might fail this test?

272
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:51,585
Well...

273
00:16:52,964 --> 00:16:54,795
yes...

274
00:16:54,866 --> 00:16:58,563
because l didn't do anything.

275
00:16:58,637 --> 00:16:59,968
He nailed it. A+.

276
00:17:00,005 --> 00:17:02,803
As far as l'm concerned

277
00:17:02,874 --> 00:17:06,139
the subject did not kill
those two people.

278
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,977
Maintenance people
at the office building

279
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:12,015
confirmed a call
to animal control

280
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,448
regarding a bad smell.

281
00:17:13,518 --> 00:17:16,248
They found a dead cat
in the ventilation ducts

282
00:17:16,321 --> 00:17:18,084
on the second foor.

283
00:17:18,156 --> 00:17:19,783
That still
doesn't explain

284
00:17:19,858 --> 00:17:21,416
why he was
there late.

285
00:17:21,493 --> 00:17:23,051
He's a civil servant
with initiative

286
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:24,823
and we busted him for it.

287
00:17:24,896 --> 00:17:27,091
He was crawling
up an air duct by himself

288
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:28,530
without alerting security.

289
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,931
He passed the test.

290
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:31,093
His story checks out.

291
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:32,500
He's not the guy.

292
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,937
lt doesn't mean
your profile's incorrect.

293
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:37,406
Scully's right. lt's the guy.

294
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:40,410
What doyou got, Mulder?

295
00:17:40,478 --> 00:17:42,844
He lied on questions 1 1 and 1 3.

296
00:17:42,948 --> 00:17:45,109
His electrodermal
and cardiographic response

297
00:17:45,216 --> 00:17:46,683
nearly go offthe chart.

298
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,948
ls number 1 1
the hundred-year-old question?

299
00:17:50,021 --> 00:17:51,750
Let me tell you

300
00:17:51,823 --> 00:17:54,053
I had a reaction
to that stupid question.

301
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,593
And what the hell
is Powhatan Mill?

302
00:17:56,661 --> 00:17:58,322
Two murders with matching M.O.s

303
00:17:58,396 --> 00:18:00,830
occurred in Powhatan Mill
in 1 933.

304
00:18:00,899 --> 00:18:02,093
Look at the chart.

305
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:03,862
My interpretation...

306
00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:05,732
l don't need you or that machine

307
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:08,068
telling me ifTooms was alive
in '33.

308
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:10,039
He's the guy.

309
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:11,097
( sighs )

310
00:18:11,176 --> 00:18:12,734
l'm letting him go.

311
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:15,746
( tearingandcrumplingpaper )

312
00:18:15,814 --> 00:18:17,509
You coming?

313
00:18:17,615 --> 00:18:19,105
Tom, l want
to thankyou

314
00:18:19,217 --> 00:18:22,675
for letting me put in time
with the V.C.S.

315
00:18:22,787 --> 00:18:25,950
but l am officially assigned
to the X Files.

316
00:18:26,024 --> 00:18:27,423
l'll see
what l can do.

317
00:18:27,492 --> 00:18:29,653
Tom, l can
look out for myself.

318
00:18:29,728 --> 00:18:32,288
You said
Mulderwas out there.

319
00:18:32,364 --> 00:18:34,525
That guy's insane.

320
00:18:40,472 --> 00:18:42,303
( doorcloses )

321
00:18:42,374 --> 00:18:44,501
Youknew
they wouldn'tbelieveyou.

322
00:18:44,576 --> 00:18:46,441
Why did you push it?

323
00:18:46,511 --> 00:18:48,672
Maybe l thought
you caught the right guy.

324
00:18:48,747 --> 00:18:51,841
And maybe l run into
so many people who are hostile

325
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,248
just because
they can't open their minds

326
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,445
to the possibilities

327
00:18:55,553 --> 00:18:59,216
that sometimes the need
to mess with their heads

328
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:02,555
outweighs the millstone
ofhumiliation.

329
00:19:02,627 --> 00:19:06,119
lt seems likeyou were acting
very territorial.

330
00:19:06,197 --> 00:19:07,255
l don't know.
Forget it.

331
00:19:07,332 --> 00:19:07,991
Ofcourse l was.

332
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:08,998
ln our investigations

333
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:11,126
you may not
always agree with me

334
00:19:11,202 --> 00:19:13,534
but at least
you respect thejourney.

335
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:16,472
And ifyou want to continue
working with them

336
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,677
l won't hold it againstyou.

337
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:20,666
l won't hold it againstyou.

338
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,577
l don't know.

339
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:25,275
You must have
something more

340
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,908
than your polygraph
interpretation

341
00:19:26,985 --> 00:19:28,816
to back up
this bizarre theory

342
00:19:28,887 --> 00:19:31,355
and l have to see
what it is.

343
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,126
Mulder:
These are Eugene Tooms's prints.

344
00:19:40,165 --> 00:19:44,363
( computerkeys clicking )

345
00:19:44,436 --> 00:19:48,236
This is the fingerprint
they took from Usher's office.

346
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:51,331
lt matches the old ones
from the X Files.

347
00:19:51,443 --> 00:19:52,842
Obviously, no match.

348
00:19:52,911 --> 00:19:55,243
What if...

349
00:19:55,313 --> 00:19:56,746
somehow...

350
00:19:56,815 --> 00:19:58,874
( keys clicking )

351
00:20:10,361 --> 00:20:12,955
How could that be?

352
00:20:13,031 --> 00:20:15,522
The only thing
l know for certain is...

353
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,965
they let him go.

354
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,984
( dogbarking in distance )

355
00:23:11,242 --> 00:23:13,210
(yelling )

356
00:23:27,725 --> 00:23:29,693
64 inches from the south wall.

357
00:23:29,761 --> 00:23:31,922
Let's run a check
on liver transplants

358
00:23:31,996 --> 00:23:33,554
in the next 24 hours.

359
00:23:33,631 --> 00:23:35,531
Maybe this thing
is black market.

360
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,625
Come on. lt was
ripped out ofthere.

361
00:23:37,702 --> 00:23:38,828
Look, at this point

362
00:23:38,903 --> 00:23:40,928
l'm willing to give
any theory a shot--

363
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:42,097
any sane theory.

364
00:23:42,173 --> 00:23:43,333
l'm sorry, Dana

365
00:23:43,408 --> 00:23:45,467
but l onlywant
qualified members

366
00:23:45,543 --> 00:23:47,909
ofthe investigating team
at the crime scene.

367
00:23:47,979 --> 00:23:49,537
What's the matter,
Colton?

368
00:23:49,614 --> 00:23:51,582
You worried
l'll solveyour case?

369
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:53,344
Tom, we have
authorized access

370
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:54,543
to this crime scene.

371
00:23:54,652 --> 00:23:56,051
A report ofyou

372
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,521
obstructing another officer's
investigation might stick out

373
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,148
on your personnel file.

374
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:06,362
Look, Dana

375
00:24:06,431 --> 00:24:07,989
whose side areyou on?

376
00:24:08,066 --> 00:24:09,363
The victim's.

377
00:24:13,571 --> 00:24:17,166
1 05 inches from the fireplace.

378
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,680
The victim
is a Thomas Werner.

379
00:24:24,749 --> 00:24:26,182
Single, white...

380
00:24:26,284 --> 00:24:27,774
That's Tooms.

381
00:24:30,054 --> 00:24:31,021
He took something.

382
00:24:47,338 --> 00:24:49,806
Baltimore P.D. checked out
Tooms's apartment.

383
00:24:49,874 --> 00:24:51,068
lt was a cover.

384
00:24:51,142 --> 00:24:52,734
No one has ever lived there

385
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,869
and he hasn't
shown up forwork

386
00:24:54,946 --> 00:24:56,311
since he was arrested.

387
00:24:56,381 --> 00:24:57,746
l found him.

388
00:24:57,815 --> 00:24:59,976
How do we learn
about the present?

389
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:01,381
We look to the past.

390
00:25:01,486 --> 00:25:03,454
l think this is where
it all began

391
00:25:03,554 --> 00:25:05,488
in 1 903 on Exeter Street.

392
00:25:05,556 --> 00:25:06,784
Look at the address

393
00:25:06,858 --> 00:25:08,553
ofthat first murder
in 1 903.

394
00:25:10,895 --> 00:25:13,625
Apartment 203.

395
00:25:13,698 --> 00:25:15,928
He killed the guy above him.

396
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,297
Maybe
his neighbor

397
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:19,563
played the Victrola too loud.

398
00:25:19,637 --> 00:25:21,537
This must be Tooms's
great-grandfather.

399
00:25:21,606 --> 00:25:23,267
What about the prints?

400
00:25:23,341 --> 00:25:25,366
Genetics might explain
the patterns

401
00:25:25,443 --> 00:25:28,935
and the sociopathic
attitudes and behaviors.

402
00:25:29,013 --> 00:25:32,073
lt begins with one family member
who raises an offspring

403
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,845
who raises the next child...

404
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:35,942
So what is this,
the anti-Waltons?

405
00:25:36,053 --> 00:25:37,680
Well, what doyou think?

406
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:39,882
l thinkwe have to track
Eugene Tooms.

407
00:25:39,991 --> 00:25:42,357
There's four down
and one to go this year.

408
00:25:42,427 --> 00:25:45,294
lfwe don't get him now,
the next chance is...

409
00:25:45,363 --> 00:25:47,297
2023.

410
00:25:47,365 --> 00:25:49,265
You'll head the Bureau by then.

411
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:50,960
You go through the census.

412
00:25:51,035 --> 00:25:52,935
l'll plough through
this century's

413
00:25:53,004 --> 00:25:55,165
marriage, birth,
death certificates...

414
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:56,797
Doyou have any Dramamine?

415
00:25:56,874 --> 00:25:58,933
These things make me seasick.

416
00:26:28,372 --> 00:26:29,737
Anything?

417
00:26:29,807 --> 00:26:31,035
Nope.

418
00:26:31,108 --> 00:26:33,338
He disappeared
offthe face ofthe earth.

419
00:26:33,411 --> 00:26:34,742
You?

420
00:26:34,812 --> 00:26:36,677
Neverwas born,
never married

421
00:26:36,747 --> 00:26:38,146
never died.

422
00:26:38,216 --> 00:26:40,514
At least
in Baltimore County.

423
00:26:40,618 --> 00:26:43,018
Well, l did find
one thing, though.

424
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:47,114
Um, it's the current address
ofthe investigating officer

425
00:26:47,225 --> 00:26:50,456
ofthe Powhatan Mill murders
in 1 933.

426
00:26:50,528 --> 00:26:54,362
l've been waiting 25 years
foryou.

427
00:26:54,432 --> 00:26:56,229
Sir?

428
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:00,031
l called it quits
in 1 968

429
00:27:00,104 --> 00:27:03,767
after 45 years
as a cop...

430
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:09,006
and those killings
at Powhatan Mill.

431
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,707
l was a sheriffthen

432
00:27:10,781 --> 00:27:12,772
and l'd seen
my share ofmurders--

433
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:16,013
bloody ones--

434
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,487
but l could go home and...

435
00:27:19,557 --> 00:27:21,821
pitch a few baseballs
to my kid

436
00:27:21,893 --> 00:27:24,020
and never give it
a second thought.

437
00:27:24,095 --> 00:27:25,687
You got to be able
to do that.

438
00:27:25,763 --> 00:27:28,755
You... you'd go crazy,
right?

439
00:27:30,268 --> 00:27:34,534
But those murders
in Powhatan Mill...

440
00:27:34,605 --> 00:27:40,339
When l walked into that room,
my heart went cold.

441
00:27:40,411 --> 00:27:43,869
My hands... numbed.

442
00:27:45,283 --> 00:27:48,343
l could feel...

443
00:27:48,452 --> 00:27:49,783
it.

444
00:27:49,854 --> 00:27:52,846
Feel what, Frank?

445
00:27:52,957 --> 00:27:54,982
( sighs )

446
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:59,859
When l first heard
about the death camps in 1 945

447
00:27:59,931 --> 00:28:02,229
l remembered Powhatan Mill.

448
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,259
When l see the Kurds
and the Bosnians...

449
00:28:06,337 --> 00:28:08,328
that room is there...

450
00:28:08,406 --> 00:28:09,737
l tell you.

451
00:28:09,807 --> 00:28:12,469
lt's like all of
the horrible acts

452
00:28:12,543 --> 00:28:14,807
that humans
are capable of

453
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:21,045
somehow gave birth
to some kind ofhuman...

454
00:28:21,152 --> 00:28:22,449
monster.

455
00:28:22,553 --> 00:28:24,248
( sighs )

456
00:28:24,355 --> 00:28:25,413
That's why l say

457
00:28:25,523 --> 00:28:27,616
l've been waiting
foryou.

458
00:28:27,725 --> 00:28:29,886
Uh...

459
00:28:29,961 --> 00:28:32,088
there's a box in the trunk here.

460
00:28:32,163 --> 00:28:34,563
Get it for me, would you please?

461
00:28:44,508 --> 00:28:48,205
Now, this is all the evidence
l've collected

462
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:50,543
officially
and unofficially.

463
00:28:50,615 --> 00:28:52,776
Unofficially?

464
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:56,980
l knew that the murders in '63
were by the same... person

465
00:28:57,088 --> 00:28:59,318
as in '33.

466
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:03,060
But by then, they had me
on a desk pushing papers

467
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,458
But by then, they had me
on a desk pushing papers

468
00:29:03,527 --> 00:29:06,257
and theywouldn't let me
anywhere near the case.

469
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,389
A piece
ofthe removed liver?

470
00:29:08,466 --> 00:29:11,299
But, you know,
that's not the only trophy

471
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:12,666
he tookwith him.

472
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:15,933
Family members reported
small personal effects

473
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,031
missing in each case--

474
00:29:18,142 --> 00:29:20,110
a hairbrush
in the Walters murder

475
00:29:20,211 --> 00:29:22,372
a coffee mug
in the Taylor murder.

476
00:29:22,446 --> 00:29:27,247
Haveyou ever heard the name
Eugene VictorTooms?

477
00:29:27,318 --> 00:29:29,684
When theywouldn't bring me
aboard in '63

478
00:29:29,754 --> 00:29:31,722
l did

479
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:33,120
some ofmy own work.

480
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,317
l took these
surveillance pictures.

481
00:29:35,393 --> 00:29:37,759
Now, this...

482
00:29:37,828 --> 00:29:40,422
is Tooms.

483
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:45,927
Ofcourse, that was him
30 years ago.

484
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:49,237
And this...

485
00:29:50,508 --> 00:29:53,033
...is the apartment
where he lived.

486
00:29:53,144 --> 00:29:54,702
it was located at...

487
00:29:54,812 --> 00:29:56,439
...66 Exeter Street?

488
00:29:56,514 --> 00:29:58,243
Right.

489
00:29:58,315 --> 00:29:59,577
That's it.

490
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:00,947
Right there.

491
00:30:19,637 --> 00:30:22,572
( birds cooing )

492
00:30:32,316 --> 00:30:34,341
Here's 1 03.

493
00:30:47,465 --> 00:30:49,626
The old man was right.

494
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,827
You can feel it.

495
00:31:06,117 --> 00:31:07,584
( sighs )

496
00:31:07,651 --> 00:31:09,414
There's nothing here.

497
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,948
Check this out.

498
00:31:17,094 --> 00:31:18,789
What's down here?

499
00:31:23,534 --> 00:31:25,365
l don't know.

500
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:30,006
Let's find out.

501
00:31:51,362 --> 00:31:53,626
just an old
coal cellar.

502
00:32:06,277 --> 00:32:09,644
Mulder:
Somebody having
a garage sale?

503
00:32:23,027 --> 00:32:25,689
This is the shape
on Werner's mantle.

504
00:32:25,763 --> 00:32:28,561
Frank said
he collected trophies.

505
00:32:32,336 --> 00:32:33,928
Mulder:
Does he live in here?

506
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:35,232
Scully:
lt looks like

507
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:36,966
the wall's deteriorating.

508
00:32:37,074 --> 00:32:38,974
No. Somebody made it.

509
00:32:44,648 --> 00:32:46,411
This is a nest.

510
00:32:46,483 --> 00:32:47,848
Look.

511
00:32:47,918 --> 00:32:50,386
lt's made out of
rags and newspapers.

512
00:32:50,454 --> 00:32:51,751
This looks like
the opening.

513
00:32:51,822 --> 00:32:54,017
Think there's
anything inside?

514
00:32:54,091 --> 00:32:55,854
Oh, my God,
Mulder...

515
00:32:55,926 --> 00:32:57,655
it smells like...

516
00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:01,222
l think it's bile.

517
00:33:01,298 --> 00:33:04,290
ls there anyway l can get it
offmy fingers quickly

518
00:33:04,368 --> 00:33:09,135
without betraying
my cool exterior?

519
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,868
No one could live in this.

520
00:33:11,976 --> 00:33:14,171
l don't think
it's where he lives.

521
00:33:14,245 --> 00:33:16,543
l think
it's where he hibernates.

522
00:33:16,614 --> 00:33:18,411
Hibernates?

523
00:33:18,482 --> 00:33:19,881
just listen.

524
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,317
What ifsome genetic mutation
could allow a man

525
00:33:23,387 --> 00:33:25,582
to awaken every 30 years?

526
00:33:25,656 --> 00:33:27,214
Mulder...

527
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:30,590
And what ifthe five livers
could provide him sustenance

528
00:33:30,661 --> 00:33:32,026
for that period?

529
00:33:32,096 --> 00:33:34,724
What ifTooms is some kind
of20th-century...

530
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:37,858
genetic mutant?

531
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:40,267
ln any case, he's not here now

532
00:33:40,371 --> 00:33:42,498
and he's got to come back.

533
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:44,233
We'll need a surveillance team.

534
00:33:44,341 --> 00:33:46,309
Yeah. lt will take
some finagling.

535
00:33:46,377 --> 00:33:48,607
Go downtown and see
whatyou can finagle.

536
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:50,374
And l'll keep watch.

537
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:02,850
( gasps )

538
00:34:02,927 --> 00:34:03,859
Oh, wait.

539
00:34:03,928 --> 00:34:06,123
l'm snagged on something.

540
00:34:07,131 --> 00:34:08,962
lt's okay. l got it.

541
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:33,646
lt's about time.

542
00:34:33,724 --> 00:34:35,988
so, who we
looking for again?

543
00:34:36,093 --> 00:34:37,185
Eugene Tooms.

544
00:34:37,294 --> 00:34:39,387
He's unarmed,
but consider him dangerous.

545
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:41,828
Scully and l will relieveyou
in eight hours

546
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:44,094
ifhe doesn't show--
right here.

547
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:46,363
You got it... Spooky.

548
00:34:52,242 --> 00:34:53,539
We have to talk.

549
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:54,702
l have to meet Mulder.

550
00:34:54,778 --> 00:34:56,541
That's what we have
to talk about.

551
00:34:56,613 --> 00:34:57,910
You're using
two ofmy men

552
00:34:57,982 --> 00:34:59,415
to sit in front
ofa building

553
00:34:59,483 --> 00:35:01,610
that's been condemned
for ten years?

554
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:04,415
lt isn't interfering
with your investigation.

555
00:35:04,488 --> 00:35:05,750
When we first had lunch

556
00:35:05,823 --> 00:35:07,757
l looked forward
to working with you

557
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:09,485
but now l couldn't haveyou

558
00:35:09,593 --> 00:35:10,389
far enough away.

559
00:35:10,494 --> 00:35:11,461
Don't go down there.

560
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:12,495
l had the stakeout

561
00:35:12,563 --> 00:35:13,723
called off.

562
00:35:13,831 --> 00:35:15,059
You can't do that.

563
00:35:15,132 --> 00:35:17,032
l can't,
but my regional ASAC can

564
00:35:17,101 --> 00:35:19,433
especially after
l told them about

565
00:35:19,503 --> 00:35:21,471
the irresponsible
waste in man-hours.

566
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:22,937
Huh-uh.
Let me call Mulder.

567
00:35:23,007 --> 00:35:26,170
ls this what it takes
to climb the ladder, Colton?

568
00:35:26,243 --> 00:35:28,040
All the way to the top.

569
00:35:28,112 --> 00:35:30,910
Then l can't wait
till you fall off

570
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:33,415
and land on your ass.

571
00:35:37,821 --> 00:35:39,015
( phoneringing )

572
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:40,283
This is Fox Mulder.

573
00:35:40,357 --> 00:35:41,415
l'm not here.

574
00:35:41,492 --> 00:35:42,959
Leave a message.

575
00:36:13,457 --> 00:36:14,856
Where is everyone?

576
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:16,256
Scully?

577
00:36:27,237 --> 00:36:28,534
This is Fox Mulder.

578
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:29,503
l'm not here.

579
00:36:29,573 --> 00:36:30,835
Leave a message.

580
00:36:30,908 --> 00:36:32,569
Mulder, you must have gone out

581
00:36:32,643 --> 00:36:34,543
since Colton gave us
the night off.

582
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:37,205
l saywe file a complaint
against him.

583
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:38,748
l am furious.

584
00:36:38,816 --> 00:36:40,875
Call me when you get in.

585
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:42,543
Okay. Bye.

586
00:37:36,106 --> 00:37:37,130
( gasps )

587
00:37:37,207 --> 00:37:38,674
Oh, my...

588
00:37:48,285 --> 00:37:49,513
( phoneringing )

589
00:37:49,586 --> 00:37:50,746
Damn it, answer!

590
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,338
( grunting )

591
00:38:16,413 --> 00:38:17,971
( grunting )

592
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:23,978
(yelling )

593
00:38:37,201 --> 00:38:37,895
Scully!

594
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:00,852
( grunting )

595
00:39:00,924 --> 00:39:02,619
You all right?

596
00:39:09,499 --> 00:39:12,195
He's not going to get
his quota this year.

597
00:40:23,874 --> 00:40:25,637
Look at him.

598
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:27,472
He's building
another nest.

599
00:40:27,544 --> 00:40:29,603
You'll be interested
to know

600
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,012
that l've ordered
some genetic tests.

601
00:40:32,082 --> 00:40:34,573
The preliminary
medical exam revealed

602
00:40:34,651 --> 00:40:36,949
quite abnormal
development

603
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,181
in the muscular
and skeletal systems

604
00:40:39,256 --> 00:40:42,248
as well as a continually
declining metabolic rate.

605
00:40:42,326 --> 00:40:44,658
lt dips way below
the levels registered

606
00:40:44,728 --> 00:40:45,752
in deep sleep.

607
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:46,921
Did you hear

608
00:40:46,997 --> 00:40:48,658
what l said, Mulder?

609
00:40:48,732 --> 00:40:50,393
All these people
putting bars on theirwindows...

610
00:40:50,467 --> 00:40:53,800
spending good money
on high-tech security systems

611
00:40:53,904 --> 00:40:56,964
trying to feel safe?

612
00:40:58,342 --> 00:41:00,674
l look at this guy, and l think

613
00:41:00,744 --> 00:41:04,339
"lt ain't enough."
