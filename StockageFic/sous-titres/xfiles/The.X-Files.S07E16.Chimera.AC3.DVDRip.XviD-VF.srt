1
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:14,774
- Hey. You sure I can't help?
- Absolutely not.

2
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,908
- All set.
- Oh, Martha, you make this look so easy.

3
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:21,681
- It's not too much, you think?
- Are you kidding?
This is just perfect.

4
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:24,622
It's exactly the way
I always dreamt that Easter should be.

5
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:28,559
- Mommy, look!
- Oh, good for you, Michelle.

6
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:32,120
What you've done is really fabulous. The
kids are gonna remember this forever.

7
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:38,333
I hope there are
some things they won't remember.

8
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:42,967
- What is she doing here?
- Her son is in Michelle's class,
Martha. Be nice.

9
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,504
Jenny, hi.
It's good to see you.

10
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,515
Hey, Ellen. Martha.

11
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,026
She's shaken up, Howard.

12
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,654
It took me two hours
to put her to bed.

13
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,857
All I'm saying is...

14
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,866
No, I didn't see any bird.

15
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:18,665
But whatever it was, it scared her
and she wants to be with her daddy.

16
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,468
That's all I'm saying.

17
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,442
Well, can't you come home
one day early?

18
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,204
All right, fine.

19
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,216
I love you too.

20
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:26,097
- Anything?
- No. She'll come.

21
00:04:26,164 --> 00:04:29,361
It's a matter of time.

22
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:31,959
Well, I hope you realize
there's no evidence whatsoever...

23
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:35,905
that this mystery woman
of yours has even committed a crime.

24
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:40,469
Though her wardrobe
comes close.

25
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:44,982
Ah. Six prostitutes
were seen with her at Dirty Dames,

26
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,177
never to be seen again.

27
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:50,619
Not only might she be a female
serial killer, rare in and of itself,

28
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:53,852
but twice police raided
that club to arrest her.

29
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:55,916
And twice they came up
empty-handed.

30
00:04:55,994 --> 00:05:00,761
She's on tape goin' in, the exits
are covered. She's nowhere to be found.

31
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:03,494
What happens to her?
She disappeared? Turn invisible?

32
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:09,034
Well, I hope we catch her
so she can tell us...

33
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:11,371
before I have to spend
another night here.

34
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:14,901
You know, Mulder, I don't know
about you, but I find this
all very depressing.

35
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,747
This round-the-clock exposure
to the seamy underbelly.

36
00:05:19,818 --> 00:05:23,515
It's a job, Scully.
Vigilance in the face of privation.

37
00:05:23,588 --> 00:05:26,352
The sheer will that it takes
to sit in this crappy room...

38
00:05:26,424 --> 00:05:29,621
spying on the dregs of society
until our suspect surfaces.

39
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:33,693
There is something
ennobling in that.

40
00:05:38,036 --> 00:05:39,970
Mulder.

41
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,370
Now?

42
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:46,376
All right. I gotta go.

43
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:50,311
Mulder?

44
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:06,220
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Yeah, sit down.

45
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,434
Two weeks ago, a woman named
Martha Crittendon...

46
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:13,835
disappeared from her home
in Bethany, Vermont.

47
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:16,169
Local police haven't
turned up any sign of her.

48
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:18,266
I'm hoping you may
be able to.

49
00:06:18,343 --> 00:06:20,607
- I'm already on a case.
- You're on a stakeout.

50
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:22,840
I'm confident Agent Scully
can continue in your absence.

51
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:27,277
Why? What did I do?

52
00:06:27,352 --> 00:06:30,549
There may be aspects
to this that...

53
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:32,613
speak to your strengths
as an investigator.

54
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:36,360
Specifically?

55
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:39,022
Ravens.

56
00:06:40,398 --> 00:06:42,332
What do you know
about 'em...

57
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,531
their mythological
or paranormal significance?

58
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:50,267
Well, the, uh...

59
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:55,244
the raven is considered
a very powerful symbol...

60
00:06:55,313 --> 00:06:58,441
in certain Norse, Celtic
and Native-American cultures.

61
00:06:58,516 --> 00:07:00,450
Mostly a negative one.

62
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:04,318
Indians view it as a deceiving spirit.
Christianity mostly
associates it with evil.

63
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:07,051
And then, of course,
there's Poe's Raven...

64
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,889
and Nevermore
and all that stuff.

65
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:13,656
Martha Crittendon's
seven-year-old daughter...

66
00:07:13,732 --> 00:07:17,566
claimed she was attacked by a raven
earlier the day her mother disappeared.

67
00:07:17,635 --> 00:07:21,366
Later, she heard one inside
the house before she discovered
her mother was missing.

68
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,340
No, really,
what did I do?

69
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:26,900
It's the only lead
that hasn't been explored.

70
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:29,208
I wanna know if it has
any bearing on the case.

71
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,340
I'm also assuming that the fact
that Martha Crittendon's father...

72
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:35,386
is a federal judge also has
a little bearing on this case?

73
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:39,822
It's been made clear to me that
locating her is my top priority.

74
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:41,825
I'm making it yours as well.

75
00:08:03,748 --> 00:08:06,046
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah.

76
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:09,052
Phil Adderly. Welcome to Bethany.
I appreciate the help.

77
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,089
Sure. I don't know
how much help I'm gonna be.

78
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:14,887
I know you had a lot of good
investigators on the case.

79
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,689
- So, uh, you wanna just take
a quick look around?
- Great. Thanks.

80
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:20,697
So tell me about
Martha Crittendon.

81
00:08:20,765 --> 00:08:23,427
Well, she and my wife Ellen,
they're best friends.

82
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:25,992
Martha's much admired here.

83
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,801
She's devoted to her family,
active in the community.

84
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:33,332
I mean, needless to say,
the whole town is very concerned.

85
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:37,211
- So, what's your theory
on what happened?
- I'm hopin' you'll tell me.

86
00:08:37,282 --> 00:08:40,945
There's no ransom note,
no prints or blood evidence.

87
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:44,580
- Her husband was out of town
when she disappeared?
- In Miami at a conference.

88
00:08:44,656 --> 00:08:46,590
It checks out.

89
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:49,923
Howard didn't have
anything to do with this.

90
00:08:58,536 --> 00:09:00,800
What do you know
about a raven?

91
00:09:01,906 --> 00:09:03,840
Yeah, yeah.
Michelle, their...

92
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:06,138
their little girl
was saying something about that.

93
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:08,202
Got me.

94
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,213
Poor kid.

95
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:13,512
- You wanna talk to her?
- Not necessary.

96
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:17,077
You sure, uh, Martha's
last name isn't Stewart?

97
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:20,818
Tell me about it. Last year this place
made the cover of New England Home.

98
00:09:27,632 --> 00:09:30,032
How many talons
would you say a raven had?

99
00:09:32,203 --> 00:09:34,137
Never mind.

100
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:45,111
You know what this is?
Do you know what was hanging here?

101
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:48,482
It was a mirror.
It was found broken.

102
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:52,114
- You had no other signs of struggle?
- Not a one.

103
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,853
- Does that mean somethin' to you?

104
00:09:57,128 --> 00:09:59,995
Howard, this is Agent Mulder
with the F.B.I.

105
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:02,032
Sir.
I hope we can help.

106
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,967
I appreciate your coming.

107
00:10:05,036 --> 00:10:08,699
I'm wondering now... if this isn't
just a waste of your time.

108
00:10:08,773 --> 00:10:11,970
How so?

109
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:14,136
With all the police
coming and going,

110
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:16,442
this place is a wreck.

111
00:10:16,514 --> 00:10:20,041
I was straightening up
and I... found something.

112
00:10:23,054 --> 00:10:25,022
Uh, birth control pills.

113
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:27,557
I think Martha was having
an affair.

114
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:34,029
After Michelle, we decided
not to have more children.

115
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:36,032
I had a vasectomy.

116
00:10:37,535 --> 00:10:42,165
They're in Martha's name.
She ordered them off the Internet.

117
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,199
Because I guess
small towns talk.

118
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:51,715
Of course, then I started
looking all around and I...

119
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:56,252
found this in the pocket
of her favorite coat.

120
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:58,755
I don't know what
this goes to...

121
00:10:58,823 --> 00:11:01,087
or what it means,
if anything.

122
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:04,526
But the pills...

123
00:11:04,595 --> 00:11:07,120
Do you have any idea
who your wife may have been seeing?

124
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:09,132
Whoever he is,

125
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:12,961
Martha may be with him.

126
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:15,369
It explains why
we haven't found her.

127
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:20,307
She doesn't wanna be found.

128
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:54,310
Cute kid.

129
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:56,745
Oh, Jenny, you scared me.

130
00:11:58,082 --> 00:12:01,883
- You do those up yourself?
- Uh, yeah.

131
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:05,144
I know Martha and you were good friends.
You must be pretty upset.

132
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:07,813
Of course.
I'm sure we all are.

133
00:12:09,156 --> 00:12:12,284
Maybe you'd like some to put up
on your side of town.

134
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,160
My side of town?

135
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,860
- Yeah, sure.
- Look, I didn't mean that
the way it kind of sounded.

136
00:12:20,935 --> 00:12:25,599
No, it just naturally comes
out that way when you think
you're better than everyone.

137
00:12:25,673 --> 00:12:28,005
You and Martha
are two peas in a pod.

138
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:30,839
Jenny, I don't think
I'm better than anyone.

139
00:12:30,912 --> 00:12:33,107
You and me got more
in common than you know.

140
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:54,994
Yeah, right.

141
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:57,867
Right. Thanks.

142
00:12:57,939 --> 00:13:00,874
Whoever Martha was seeing, the two of
them covered their tracks pretty good.

143
00:13:00,942 --> 00:13:05,538
Phone records don't show anything. You
think this person took her, harmed her?

144
00:13:05,613 --> 00:13:08,548
I wouldn't rule it out, but I doubt it.
According to your Audubon book,

145
00:13:08,616 --> 00:13:10,550
a raven has four talons.

146
00:13:10,618 --> 00:13:13,382
That matches the scratches
we found on Martha Crittendon's mantle.

147
00:13:13,454 --> 00:13:17,015
You're not saying a raven's the reason
Martha's gone missing?

148
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:19,321
No, no, not a raven itself.

149
00:13:19,393 --> 00:13:22,453
But in folklore, ravens
are companions to evil...

150
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,556
evil spirits, witches,
warlocks, that kind of thing.

151
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:29,797
Agent Mulder,
I appreciate the different tact
you're taking on this investigation,

152
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,895
but this whole bird thing?

153
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:36,569
And keep in mind, you're basing this
on the word of a seven-year-old girl.

154
00:13:36,644 --> 00:13:40,603
Well, there was also a broken mirror
in Martha's house.

155
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:43,514
Mirrors are considered
items of enchantment.

156
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:45,814
A broken one...
means something.

157
00:13:45,886 --> 00:13:49,117
I'm not exactly sure what it is,
but... it means something.

158
00:13:53,828 --> 00:13:55,989
Oh.

159
00:13:56,063 --> 00:13:58,327
- Hey, sweet girl.
- There's Papa.

160
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,334
Agent Mulder, this is my
daughter Katie and my wife Ellen.

161
00:14:01,402 --> 00:14:04,132
- Nice to meet you.
- We're so glad you're here.
Look, our house is your house.

162
00:14:04,205 --> 00:14:07,197
- We have a spare room set up.
I'm sure you'll be comfortable.
- No, that's...

163
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:11,040
There's no arguments. We're so grateful
that you're here to find Martha.

164
00:14:11,112 --> 00:14:13,273
It's the least we can do.

165
00:14:13,347 --> 00:14:15,281
Okay.

166
00:14:21,222 --> 00:14:24,089
I should really get the bureau
to reimburse you for room and board.

167
00:14:24,158 --> 00:14:28,185
- Don't be silly. This is just
a typical meal around here.
- Really?

168
00:14:28,262 --> 00:14:31,595
Bill works so much that supper is
usually the only time we see each other.

169
00:14:31,665 --> 00:14:35,499
- And I like to make it special.

170
00:14:37,738 --> 00:14:40,138
Excuse me.
Sorry.

171
00:14:40,207 --> 00:14:42,141
Thanks.

172
00:14:46,347 --> 00:14:49,612
- Mulder.
- Mulder, please tell me I can go home.

173
00:14:49,683 --> 00:14:51,742
Hey, Scully.
How's the stakeout?

174
00:14:51,819 --> 00:14:55,311
Well, the furnace broke
and I can just about see my breath.

175
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:57,653
Ouch.
Sorry to hear that.

176
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:04,589
That, and I've witnessed
a couple hundred things
I'd like to erase from my brain.

177
00:15:04,665 --> 00:15:06,633
Eeew.

178
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,160
But as of yet, no mystery woman.

179
00:15:11,238 --> 00:15:14,207
Well, she'll come.
You know, it's just a matter of time.

180
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:16,209
She'll show up.
I'm sure of that.

181
00:15:16,277 --> 00:15:18,507
Not before I die
of malnutrition.

182
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:22,447
Scully, tough it out. Whatever doesn't
kill you, makes you stronger, right?

183
00:15:22,516 --> 00:15:25,815
- No, no. No capers. Thank you.
- I'm sorry. What?

184
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:30,255
I said, "What a crazy caper." I'll talk
to you later. And keep warm. Bye.

185
00:15:34,995 --> 00:15:38,021
Did I hear you say something
about stakeout? What's the case?

186
00:15:38,099 --> 00:15:40,158
Sweetie,
this is family time.

187
00:15:40,234 --> 00:15:42,794
- Don't make our guest talk shop
at the dinner table.
- Fair enough.

188
00:15:45,106 --> 00:15:48,872
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

189
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,275
What's the matter,
sweetheart?

190
00:15:59,353 --> 00:16:01,287
I thought that
was your favorite.

191
00:16:01,355 --> 00:16:03,755
It tastes different
when Mommy makes it.

192
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:08,323
Yeah.

193
00:16:08,395 --> 00:16:10,329
I know.

194
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,134
How 'bout we go get hamburgers?

195
00:16:15,202 --> 00:16:18,035
Would you like that instead?

196
00:16:20,741 --> 00:16:22,675
It's back.

197
00:16:37,491 --> 00:16:41,257
- Everything's all right, sweetheart.
I'll be right back.
- Okay.

198
00:17:16,096 --> 00:17:18,291
What do you make
of these claw marks?

199
00:17:18,365 --> 00:17:22,893
Well, one time I saw the victim of
a bear attack look something like that.

200
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,428
Only bears don't plant
their kill in the rose garden.

201
00:17:26,507 --> 00:17:28,702
I was gonna say.

202
00:17:28,776 --> 00:17:31,939
The body's been around here for a while.
Probably since she went missing.

203
00:17:32,012 --> 00:17:34,606
What about your ravens?

204
00:17:34,682 --> 00:17:37,344
Howard said something
about ravens.

205
00:17:37,418 --> 00:17:40,615
Yeah.
Feedin' on her. See?

206
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,900
You okay?

207
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,700
I'm not arrestin' Howard.
I don't care how it looks.

208
00:17:58,772 --> 00:18:03,175
- Body buried in his own yard.
He didn't do this.
- I agree.

209
00:18:03,244 --> 00:18:06,543
The poor guy's suffered enough already.

210
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:14,812
- What are you doing?
You shouldn't be here.
- What...

211
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:16,719
Oh, my God.

212
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,725
- Martha, no.
- Ellen, honey, I am so sorry.

213
00:18:19,793 --> 00:18:21,852
It can't be.

214
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:23,760
It's okay. It's okay.

215
00:18:26,734 --> 00:18:29,760
The thing that did
that to her,

216
00:18:29,837 --> 00:18:32,738
I think I saw it today.

217
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:39,869
I saw its reflection.

218
00:18:39,947 --> 00:18:43,906
It had a face out of a nightmare.
These long claws, the kind that could...

219
00:18:47,855 --> 00:18:52,019
The window shattered. I don't know how.
And when I turned around, it was gone.

220
00:18:52,092 --> 00:18:55,584
I don't know what I thought it was.
I didn't think it was real.
How could it be?

221
00:18:55,663 --> 00:18:57,631
But then when I saw
Martha's face...

222
00:18:57,698 --> 00:18:59,928
Honey, you've been
through a lot.

223
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,560
You don't believe me.

224
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:06,802
I do.

225
00:19:06,874 --> 00:19:10,605
You said the car window shattered
after you saw the reflection.

226
00:19:10,678 --> 00:19:13,306
And there's a broken mirror
in Martha's house.

227
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,439
I don't think
that's a coincidence.

228
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:19,077
- But what could it mean?
- Mirrors are considered doorways.

229
00:19:19,153 --> 00:19:23,647
In the Victorian era, they built
mirrored rooms called "psychomantiums,"

230
00:19:23,724 --> 00:19:28,093
where they thought they could summon
forth spirits from the spirit world.

231
00:19:28,162 --> 00:19:31,131
Denizens from the spirit world
were brought into this world.

232
00:19:31,198 --> 00:19:33,166
"Denizens of the spirit world?"

233
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:36,225
You asked about the raven.
The raven is a carrion bird...

234
00:19:36,303 --> 00:19:38,237
attracted to death
and decay.

235
00:19:38,305 --> 00:19:41,365
What if... this entity
that you saw...

236
00:19:41,442 --> 00:19:43,842
is somehow a personification
of that?

237
00:19:43,911 --> 00:19:47,745
What if this creature was brought forth
in order to attack Martha?

238
00:19:47,815 --> 00:19:50,306
Then the question becomes
who summoned it forth.

239
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,686
Ellen, do you know if Martha
had any enemies?

240
00:19:55,756 --> 00:19:58,816
Can you think of anyone at all
who would have wished her harm?

241
00:20:03,762 --> 00:20:06,322
I sure as hell didn't
have anything to do with it.

242
00:20:06,398 --> 00:20:09,526
They're just routine questions,
Miss Uphouse. Answer 'em
and we'll be out of here.

243
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:13,931
We understand there was no love lost
between you and Martha Crittendon.

244
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:17,032
And where do you
understand that from?

245
00:20:18,577 --> 00:20:22,638
- Mrs. Sheriff, right?
- It's not exactly a town secret.

246
00:20:22,715 --> 00:20:25,775
Right. Like there aren't
enough of those already.

247
00:20:27,152 --> 00:20:31,179
Queen Martha and her perfect
little Easter egg hunts.

248
00:20:31,256 --> 00:20:34,248
She's so above the rest of us.

249
00:20:34,326 --> 00:20:36,886
Except I heard she was
steppin' out on her husband,

250
00:20:36,962 --> 00:20:40,193
knockin'boots
with who knows who.

251
00:20:40,265 --> 00:20:44,224
I'm not happy she's dead and all.
But you need to look into that.

252
00:20:44,303 --> 00:20:48,831
Well, let's stay on the subject of you...
on your police record, for instance.

253
00:20:48,907 --> 00:20:51,341
You don't suffer people
that don't give you respect.

254
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,640
I'm thinking of that hair
salon owner you assaulted.

255
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:56,806
That was forever ago.
And I paid for that.

256
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:59,077
And I had nothing
to do with Martha.

257
00:20:59,151 --> 00:21:02,143
Where were you the night
she disappeared?

258
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:06,086
At home, all night.

259
00:21:07,993 --> 00:21:10,257
I gotta get back to work.

260
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:13,787
I don't know about you,
but I believe her.

261
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:16,027
She didn't do it.
I just don't get that vibe.

262
00:21:16,101 --> 00:21:19,229
Fair enough. But why did
she lie about her alibi?

263
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:22,903
I got that vibe pretty clear.

264
00:21:26,178 --> 00:21:28,578
- Excuse me.

265
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:30,581
I'll be in the car.

266
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,685
Mulder.

267
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:36,380
Mulder, when you
find me dead,

268
00:21:36,455 --> 00:21:38,787
my desicated corpse
propped up...

269
00:21:38,857 --> 00:21:40,984
staring lifelessly
through the telescope...

270
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,518
at drunken frat boys peeing
and vomiting into the gutter,

271
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:47,531
just know that my last thoughts
were of you...

272
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,624
and how I'd like to kill you.

273
00:21:49,702 --> 00:21:52,034
I'm sorry.
Who is this?

274
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:54,834
It's a freak show, Mulder.

275
00:21:54,907 --> 00:21:58,900
It's a nonstop parade
of every single lowlife imaginable.

276
00:21:58,977 --> 00:22:02,242
The view may not be too different here.
It's dressed up nicer,

277
00:22:02,314 --> 00:22:05,511
but underneath the surface
it's the same seamy underbelly.

278
00:22:05,584 --> 00:22:07,518
It's not the same.
Trust me.

279
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:11,022
You know, Scully, this case
has turned out to be a little
more interesting than I thought.

280
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:14,582
- And I could use your help.
- You talking about a reprieve for me?

281
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,721
Well, there's a murder victim I'd like
you to autopsy. What do you think?

282
00:22:20,466 --> 00:22:24,493
Scully, you still there?
Hello?

283
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,471
- That van is back.
- What'd you say?

284
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:31,635
- Nothing, Mulder.
I'll talk to you later, okay?

285
00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:31,300
Katie...

286
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:34,566
Get away from her!

287
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,871
- It's okay, hon. Come on.

288
00:23:48,854 --> 00:23:51,516
Be quiet now.
Shh.

289
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:54,184
Hush. Be quiet.

290
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:13,036
Oh, God. Ellen?

291
00:24:14,112 --> 00:24:16,103
Ellen, what happened?

292
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,140
Are you feeling
a little better, Ellen?

293
00:24:49,381 --> 00:24:53,579
Can you... just talk to me
a little bit about what happened?

294
00:24:55,387 --> 00:24:57,321
It came back.

295
00:24:57,389 --> 00:24:59,914
It came back?
The... The creature you saw?

296
00:25:02,828 --> 00:25:05,592
It was here, Phil.
It chased me.

297
00:25:05,664 --> 00:25:07,825
It's all right, honey.

298
00:25:18,844 --> 00:25:22,177
Please don't encourage this.
This is not what she needs.

299
00:25:22,247 --> 00:25:25,341
- I believe she saw something.
- And I believe she didn't.

300
00:25:25,417 --> 00:25:27,510
Her best friend just died,
for God's sake.

301
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:31,613
These imaginings of hers
are brought on by stress.

302
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:35,990
I have been through the entire house
and I didn't see any indication
anyone else was here.

303
00:25:36,061 --> 00:25:39,497
- What about the two broken mirrors?
- What about them?

304
00:25:39,564 --> 00:25:43,933
You think broken mirrors have
some deeper meaning, but you
still can't tell me what it is.

305
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:48,132
And in this case,
I'm thinking Ellen broke 'em herself.

306
00:25:49,608 --> 00:25:52,202
What?

307
00:26:00,585 --> 00:26:04,885
It's number six. It's a match
to the one Howard Crittendon
found in his wife's coat pocket.

308
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:09,489
- What would this be doing here?
- I don't know.

309
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:24,638
Ellen, do you recognize
this key?

310
00:26:26,178 --> 00:26:28,908
Oh, I was...
sweeping the floor...

311
00:26:28,981 --> 00:26:31,711
and it got caught up
in the sweeper.

312
00:26:32,784 --> 00:26:35,844
I never saw it before today.

313
00:26:35,921 --> 00:26:38,549
You found it before
you were attacked?

314
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:43,386
Right before.

315
00:26:43,462 --> 00:26:46,590
Right before I saw the raven.

316
00:26:46,665 --> 00:26:50,431
Let me see if my department can run this
down and find out what lock it goes to.

317
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,112
Hey, I can't do this anymore.

318
00:28:12,616 --> 00:28:14,675
- Can't, huh?
- No.

319
00:28:14,751 --> 00:28:18,050
- We gotta stop.
- Well, that's too bad.

320
00:29:04,134 --> 00:29:06,102
- Hey, good morning.
- Good morning, Ellen.

321
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:08,569
Wow.

322
00:29:08,638 --> 00:29:11,072
- Have you seen my shirt?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

323
00:29:11,141 --> 00:29:13,075
- I left it...
- It's over here.

324
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,408
Oh, Ellen, you didn't
have to go to the trouble.

325
00:29:19,482 --> 00:29:22,713
No, it's no trouble.
Actually, it helps me.

326
00:29:22,786 --> 00:29:25,880
Whenever my life's a mess,
I just do some housework.

327
00:29:25,956 --> 00:29:28,356
Gives me the illusion
I'm in control.

328
00:29:28,425 --> 00:29:32,293
- Well, maybe I should try that sometime.
- Have a seat.

329
00:29:32,362 --> 00:29:34,296
Thanks.

330
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:38,696
Yikes. Wow.

331
00:29:38,768 --> 00:29:40,793
It's just Phil's
breakfast times two.

332
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,862
Well, Phil is living large.
Where is he this morning?

333
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,704
Uh, probably out on a call.

334
00:29:46,776 --> 00:29:48,903
He'll be back.
You... You just dig in.

335
00:29:59,456 --> 00:30:01,617
- Whoa. Ow.
- Sorry.

336
00:30:01,691 --> 00:30:05,127
- Do you need milk?
- Mm-mm. I'm fine.

337
00:30:05,195 --> 00:30:07,993
I get the feeling you're not
used to anyone taking care of you.

338
00:30:08,064 --> 00:30:11,966
Well, that has a...
a vaguely pathetic ring to it.

339
00:30:12,035 --> 00:30:14,936
No, I just meant
I didn't notice a wedding band.

340
00:30:15,005 --> 00:30:17,496
- Oh.
- Do you have a significant other?

341
00:30:17,574 --> 00:30:22,602
Um, not in the widely
understood definition of that term.

342
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:26,615
Oh. Well, the right woman
will come along and change all that.

343
00:30:28,852 --> 00:30:31,343
Don't miss out
on home and family, Mr. Mulder.

344
00:30:31,421 --> 00:30:34,481
With all the terrible things
you must see in your work...

345
00:30:34,557 --> 00:30:36,957
Well, it could be
a refuge for you.

346
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:51,106
- Hi, honey.
- Sorry I'm late. Paperwork.

347
00:30:51,174 --> 00:30:53,574
- Good morning, Agent Mulder.
- Good morning.

348
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,975
I'm gonna go
check on Katie.

349
00:31:00,216 --> 00:31:02,207
You sleep well?

350
00:31:02,285 --> 00:31:05,652
I only woke up once,
when you went out.

351
00:31:05,722 --> 00:31:09,590
Well, I'll try to be
quieter next time.

352
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,253
We've got a deputy out.
We're shorthanded.

353
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,319
I had to take some calls.

354
00:31:14,397 --> 00:31:18,390
- All night?
- Yeah. We were busy.

355
00:31:20,904 --> 00:31:22,929
I spoke to the coroner
this morning.

356
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:26,567
The autopsy shows Martha Crittendon
was four weeks pregnant when she died,

357
00:31:26,643 --> 00:31:29,305
despite her birth control pills.

358
00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:33,008
Probably didn't even know it.
Any idea who the father might be?

359
00:31:35,118 --> 00:31:40,351
I mean, Howard's vasectomy
pretty much puts him out of the running.

360
00:31:43,893 --> 00:31:45,884
Any inkling who it might be?

361
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,030
Just say what's
on your mind, Agent.

362
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,631
You have a piece of evidence
in your possession that I'd like back.

363
00:31:56,706 --> 00:32:00,073
The skeleton key.
Number six.

364
00:32:13,256 --> 00:32:16,054
You wanna tell me
what this unlocks?

365
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:20,355
Once I find out,
we'll talk again.

366
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:26,965
I'm gonna hit the shower.

367
00:32:55,899 --> 00:32:59,130
I know, Brett, sweetie,
I'm sorry.

368
00:32:59,202 --> 00:33:01,261
No, I'm gonna be home
real soon.

369
00:33:01,337 --> 00:33:03,703
Mommy had to work
a double shift.

370
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:07,368
I know. I'm gonna come home
and make you breakfast.

371
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:10,310
No, no, no, don't eat
a lot of cookies. No.

372
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,848
Only two. I...

373
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:16,283
Yes, oatmeal cookies
have oatmeal in them.

374
00:33:16,352 --> 00:33:18,843
Okay.
All right, three.

375
00:33:18,922 --> 00:33:20,856
I love you.

376
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,694
Bye.

377
00:34:37,634 --> 00:34:41,400
Sheriff, you know that talk
I said we should have?

378
00:34:41,471 --> 00:34:43,405
I left her sleeping.

379
00:34:45,742 --> 00:34:48,734
So, you were having an affair
with both Jenny and Martha Crittendon?

380
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,241
I gotta hand it to you, Sheriff.
You put the service back
in the "protect and serve."

381
00:34:54,317 --> 00:34:57,252
I cared about both of them.

382
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,254
They knew about
each other?

383
00:35:01,457 --> 00:35:03,516
But I'm assuming
Ellen doesn't?

384
00:35:03,593 --> 00:35:05,527
No.

385
00:35:05,595 --> 00:35:08,393
But even if she did,
she'd find a way to rationalize it.

386
00:35:10,033 --> 00:35:11,967
I'm not defending myself,

387
00:35:12,035 --> 00:35:15,562
but... two years ago
I wanted a divorce.

388
00:35:15,638 --> 00:35:17,902
Ellen won't hear it.

389
00:35:17,974 --> 00:35:21,410
She got pregnant with Katie
and locked me up good.

390
00:35:21,477 --> 00:35:24,935
Well, I figure you got bigger problems
facing you right now.

391
00:35:30,653 --> 00:35:33,144
I didn't do this.
I swear to you.

392
00:35:33,222 --> 00:35:36,589
Anyway, what about
the broken mirrors and the raven?

393
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:40,925
You said that it was an entity that
did this. Don't you still believe that?

394
00:35:40,997 --> 00:35:44,728
I said it was an entity
summoned by somebody else.

395
00:35:44,801 --> 00:35:47,770
Whether or not they even knew about it,
is that possible?

396
00:35:47,837 --> 00:35:50,738
Can I be the reason
for all this...

397
00:35:50,807 --> 00:35:53,241
and not even
know about it?

398
00:35:56,512 --> 00:35:59,447
Hi. You've reached the Adderly's...
Phil, Ellen and Katie.

399
00:35:59,515 --> 00:36:02,006
- Please leave a message.

400
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:05,714
Ellen, this is Phil.
I was really hopin' you'd be home.

401
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,052
Look, I'm in a bit
of a situation here...

402
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,388
and there's things
we need to talk about.

403
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,554
But Agent Mulder's on his way
over there to explain it all to you.

404
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:18,032
So, if you get this message,
you just wait for him, okay? Thanks.

405
00:36:22,872 --> 00:36:26,706
I think this sleepy
little girl needs a nap.

406
00:36:26,776 --> 00:36:29,711
I do.

407
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,782
I love you.

408
00:36:41,858 --> 00:36:44,793
Go to sleep now.
Okay, baby?

409
00:37:30,937 --> 00:37:32,871
Ellen?

410
00:37:37,511 --> 00:37:39,445
Ellen?

411
00:37:46,253 --> 00:37:48,187
Mulder.

412
00:37:48,255 --> 00:37:52,191
- Mulder, I am free.
- You're free?

413
00:37:52,259 --> 00:37:55,490
Mm-hmm. I'm gonna go home,
take a shower for,

414
00:37:55,562 --> 00:37:57,496
I don't know,
eight or nine hours,

415
00:37:57,564 --> 00:38:02,092
burn the clothes that I'm wearing
and then sleep until late spring.

416
00:38:02,169 --> 00:38:04,364
- You solved the X-File.
- Yes.

417
00:38:04,438 --> 00:38:06,429
Except it's not
an X-File, Mulder.

418
00:38:06,506 --> 00:38:09,441
What are you saying? You didn't catch
our blond mystery serial killer?

419
00:38:09,509 --> 00:38:11,443
Oh, no, we caught her.

420
00:38:11,511 --> 00:38:15,140
But, uh, she isn't
a serial killer.

421
00:38:16,383 --> 00:38:18,874
Nor is she a blond.

422
00:38:18,952 --> 00:38:22,786
And she isn't even a she.

423
00:38:22,856 --> 00:38:24,653
What are you talking about?

424
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,419
What I'm talking about is these six
missing prostitutes aren't dead, Mulder.

425
00:38:30,497 --> 00:38:32,931
They are alive and well
in a halfway house...

426
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:34,990
that was set up
by this mystery blond...

427
00:38:35,068 --> 00:38:38,799
who happens to go by the name
of Mark Scott Eggbert.

428
00:38:38,872 --> 00:38:42,535
And Mr. Eggbert wishes
to acquaint lost souls...

429
00:38:42,609 --> 00:38:45,669
with the teachings of Christ.

430
00:38:45,745 --> 00:38:47,713
And that's his hook, I guess.

431
00:38:47,781 --> 00:38:50,477
He dresses up like
a fellow prostitute...

432
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:53,348
to make the girls
feel at ease.

433
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,220
But this vanishing act
is no more paranormal...

434
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,690
than a change of wardrobe, Mulder.

435
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:03,991
He goes into a place like a woman
and comes out as a man.

436
00:39:04,064 --> 00:39:06,032
- Right under...
- Our noses.

437
00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:09,694
Exactly.
A wolf in sheep's clothing.

438
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:12,829
Or I guess in this case,
a sheep in wolf s clothing.

439
00:39:12,906 --> 00:39:15,704
Well, good work, Scully.
I'll call you back later.

440
00:39:28,321 --> 00:39:30,255
Ellen?

441
00:39:32,592 --> 00:39:35,857
- Ellen, it's Agent Mulder.
- Please go away.

442
00:39:37,197 --> 00:39:40,132
Ellen, Jenny Uphouse is dead.

443
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,863
Your husband is in custody
suspected of murdering her,
only I don't think he did it.

444
00:39:43,937 --> 00:39:45,871
Do you?

445
00:39:47,174 --> 00:39:50,701
Ellen, you went out...
this morning after breakfast.

446
00:39:50,777 --> 00:39:52,870
Where'd you go?

447
00:39:52,946 --> 00:39:56,006
It's not me.
It can't be.

448
00:39:56,082 --> 00:39:58,141
I think it is.

449
00:39:58,218 --> 00:40:02,951
Ellen, I think you have a whole
other side that you're afraid to face.

450
00:40:03,023 --> 00:40:05,548
That would explain
all the broken mirrors.

451
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:09,288
You don't want to see yourself
for what you really are.

452
00:40:09,362 --> 00:40:11,922
Ellen, you have to
come out of there.

453
00:40:11,998 --> 00:40:15,866
Then what?

454
00:40:15,936 --> 00:40:18,200
My marriage, my life?

455
00:40:18,271 --> 00:40:21,434
Everything I thought I had...

456
00:40:21,508 --> 00:40:24,136
is nothing.

457
00:40:24,211 --> 00:40:26,475
It's all lies.

458
00:40:29,482 --> 00:40:32,007
I wish you'd never come here.

459
00:40:32,085 --> 00:40:34,246
Ellen, you need
to open this door.

460
00:42:08,248 --> 00:42:10,182
You wanna see her?

461
00:42:11,284 --> 00:42:13,218
Does she wanna see me?

462
00:42:16,923 --> 00:42:20,757
The doctors say she's got
some kind of dissociative disorder.

463
00:42:20,827 --> 00:42:22,761
A split personality.

464
00:42:23,997 --> 00:42:26,227
That doesn't explain
what happened, does it?

465
00:42:26,299 --> 00:42:30,395
I think it's about as close
as science can come.
I think the basic idea's right.

466
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:33,564
There's some multiple
personality disorders...

467
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,201
where an alternate personality displays
traits that the host doesn't have,

468
00:42:37,277 --> 00:42:41,737
like nearsightedness
or high blood pressure or even diabetes.

469
00:42:41,815 --> 00:42:46,377
I think in Ellen's case, the... changes
were just a lot more extreme.

470
00:42:46,453 --> 00:42:48,944
Like... Jekyl and Hyde?

471
00:42:49,022 --> 00:42:51,786
She wanted so much
from her life with you.

472
00:42:51,858 --> 00:42:54,224
A perfect life.

473
00:42:54,294 --> 00:42:58,025
And I think that at some point
she found out you were cheating
with Jenny and Martha.

474
00:42:58,098 --> 00:43:00,828
I don't know when,
but at some point she did.

475
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,391
Like you said, I think
she had to rationalize that.

476
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:06,462
And she just bottled up
her anger.

477
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:09,167
Swallowed it, and it
had to come out some way.

478
00:43:09,242 --> 00:43:11,642
I think she did what she did
to protect her family.
