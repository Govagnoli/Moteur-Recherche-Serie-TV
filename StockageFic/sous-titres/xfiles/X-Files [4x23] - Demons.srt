00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,640
Agent Mulder's not going
anywhere but to a hospital.

172
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:07,805
Okay... but we're all
going down there together.

173
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:10,507
Agent Mulder, I'd like you
to ride with us.

174
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:19,014
Mulder, I'd advise you
not to say anything more,

175
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:22,754
not until I take a look at those bodies
and the forensics reports.

176
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,535
Amy Anne Cassandra,
caucasian female.

177
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:44,207
Birth records indicate
her age at 62 years.

178
00:16:44,317 --> 00:16:48,777
The subject is 1 65 pounds,
67 inches in height.

179
00:16:48,854 --> 00:16:52,813
Preliminary exam indicates cause of
death due to a gunshot wound to chest.

180
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:54,826
Powder burns and flashing
at the point of entry...

181
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:56,828
approximately four inches
below the clavicle,

182
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:59,956
indicating the shot was delivered
at point-blank range.

183
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:03,559
Dorsal beveling of the shoulder blade
is visible at the exit wound.

184
00:17:03,636 --> 00:17:06,264
The surrounding tissue
is jagged and torn.

185
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:09,536
- No other signs of trauma present.
- Did you see this?

186
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:11,735
Yeah, from the scabbing,
it looks like a preexisting,

187
00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:14,404
-superficial puncture wound.
- Do you mind?

188
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:18,279
- What are you looking for?
- I'm not sure.

189
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:26,583
Do you have a magnifying glass?
Thanks.

190
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:34,099
I want to make sure that
in addition to the autopsy,

191
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:37,693
you also do a craniotomy
and a histological examination.

192
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,603
- It's clear what killed these people.
- I think it is too,

193
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:44,302
but what I'm more interested in
right now is why they died.

194
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,384
[Door Opens]

195
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:03,952
What's that?

196
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:07,863
Have you jogged your memory, Agent
Mulder? You want to change your story?

197
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:10,493
No. Why?

198
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:15,097
Because I have evidence here that
contradicts what it is you've told us.

199
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:18,704
I haven't really
told you anything.

200
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:21,575
You told us you haven't been
to that house since your childhood...

201
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,478
and that you didn't know
Amy or David Cassandra.

202
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,815
And you're telling me that what's
in that bag is evidence that I'm a liar?

203
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:30,355
I'm not saying
you're a liar, Agent Mulder.

204
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:33,256
I would like to believe
this memory lapse was real...

205
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:37,989
and you murdered these two people
in some fit of blind insanity.

206
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,961
- What's in the bag?
- It isn’t your gun,

207
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:46,437
which in our preliminary forensics
analysis seems to be the murder weapon,

208
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:50,339
judging from the slugs we pulled
from the floor and the wall...

209
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:53,901
and the execution-style
point-blank range.

210
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:04,121
- Is any of this coming back to you?
- No.

211
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,962
- Can I see what's in the bag?
- Be my guest.

212
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:23,341
There are two blood types
on that shirt, Agent Mulder:

213
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:27,869
one matching Amy Cassandra's,
the other matching David Cassandra's.

214
00:19:27,947 --> 00:19:31,383
Is that your shirt,
Agent Mulder?

215
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,418
Yes.

216
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:37,684
Can you explain how blood of two people
you claim not to know got on your shirt?

217
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,392
No.

218
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:47,197
What about the prints
in the house?

219
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:50,099
Were they my prints?

220
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:52,364
You're not gonna get
a confession out of me...

221
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:55,930
because I can't answer your questions
because I don't remember.

222
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:04,078
You have the right to remain silent.
You give up the right to remain silent,

223
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:08,347
anything you say can and will be used
against you in the court of law.

224
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,581
You have the right
to speak with an attorney...

225
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:13,250
and have an attorney present
during questioning.

226
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:15,293
If you so desire
and cannot afford one,

227
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:19,764
an attorney will be appointed for you
without charge before questioning.

228
00:20:19,832 --> 00:20:22,926
Do you understand each of the rights
I have explained to you?

229
00:20:32,077 --> 00:20:37,014
Mulder...
I'm gonna get you out of here.

230
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:39,016
You're a doctor,
not a lawyer, Scully.

231
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:43,521
- Did you make a confession?
- No, only to my own ignorance.

232
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:47,685
Detective, before you go through all
that, I need you to consider evidence...

233
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,127
that I think casts doubt on Agent
Mulder's involvement in this crime.

234
00:20:51,196 --> 00:20:54,165
- What kind of evidence?
- Medical evidence.

235
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:57,168
The toxicology report
on Amy Cassandra indicates...

236
00:20:57,236 --> 00:21:00,831
there was a rapid-acting anesthetic
called ketamine in her system.

237
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,534
" Ketamine"? That's a veterinary drug,
isn't it?

238
00:21:03,642 --> 00:21:08,375
Typically, but when ingested
by a person it can cause hallucinations.

239
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:10,677
- So?
- So I went to the hospital...

240
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:13,343
to go over Agent Mulder's
medical charts and blood work,

241
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:15,785
and there are traces
of the same drug in his system.

242
00:21:15,854 --> 00:21:19,881
- How would that get there?
- Probably injected.

243
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:23,190
There was a small bruise from an
injection on Amy Cassandra's right hip.

244
00:21:23,262 --> 00:21:27,289
I think if you were examined again,
we would find a corresponding puncture.

245
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:29,834
- Given by whom?
- I don't know,

246
00:21:29,902 --> 00:21:31,836
but the presence of such
a powerful drug...

247
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:34,270
could explain his memory loss
or the blackouts.

248
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:36,603
Given the weight
of all the other evidence,

249
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:39,644
I think that’s all
it explains.

250
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:43,876
Scully...
you don't have to do this.

251
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:46,213
Mulder, you have to help me out.

252
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:49,015
There is nothing here that
points directly to your guilt.

253
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:52,285
Unless somebody can show me,
with absolute certainty,

254
00:21:52,358 --> 00:21:54,883
that you were holding the weapon
that killed those two people,

255
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,327
the rest of the narrative is
far too convenient and suspect.

256
00:21:58,397 --> 00:22:02,834
The drug in your system already
suggests other explanations.

257
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:05,836
That I was partying
with a few senior citizens?

258
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:11,167
You’re jailing
an innocent man.

259
00:22:11,276 --> 00:22:14,336
Yeah, well, this way he won't
get lost for two days...

260
00:22:14,446 --> 00:22:16,710
and do something else
he won't remember.

261
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:53,884
-[Gunshot]
-[Man]Shot fired!

262
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:02,652
I'm a doctor!
Somebody call the paramedics!

263
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:09,867
He's dead.

264
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:19,774
I need to speak
with Detective Curtis right now.

265
00:23:28,053 --> 00:23:33,252
Did this officer have a history
of depression or mental illness?

266
00:23:33,325 --> 00:23:37,591
He'd been remanded from his beat
assignment to a desk job a year ago.

267
00:23:37,663 --> 00:23:40,359
His former partner had complained
on a number of occasions...

268
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:43,162
about his tendency toward
extreme irritability...

269
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:45,226
and confabulation
of the truth.

270
00:23:45,304 --> 00:23:48,762
- How do you mean ?
- The man we're talking about...

271
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:50,775
had become something
of a joke on the force.

272
00:23:50,843 --> 00:23:53,311
One of those guys
who believes in...

273
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:56,040
extraterrestrials,
stuff like that.

274
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,280
Do you see these photos?

275
00:24:00,352 --> 00:24:02,946
[Curtis]
Yeah.

276
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:05,615
- Does this mean anything to you?
- Should it?

277
00:24:06,892 --> 00:24:10,384
I think it speaks
to a pronounced mental illness.

278
00:24:10,462 --> 00:24:13,056
The compulsive
and repetitive act...

279
00:24:13,132 --> 00:24:16,659
of removing his own image from
these photos leads me to believe...

280
00:24:16,735 --> 00:24:20,364
that he not only believed these stories,
but he was traumatized by them.

281
00:24:20,472 --> 00:24:25,569
You told me this was gonna help explain
something about your partner's crime.

282
00:24:29,515 --> 00:24:32,006
What's that?

283
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:35,787
Amy Cassandra.

284
00:24:37,923 --> 00:24:40,414
Both your officer
and Amy Cassandra...

285
00:24:40,492 --> 00:24:43,461
had identical puncture wounds
at the top of the frontal lobe.

286
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:46,623
In her autopsy, Amy Cassandra's
was a deep puncture...

287
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:48,791
through the cranium
to the dura mater.

288
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:51,665
- My officer had the same thing?
- Yes.

289
00:24:51,737 --> 00:24:53,671
I think your officer
knew of Amy Cassandra,

290
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:56,832
and somehow his suicide
is linked to her death,

291
00:24:56,942 --> 00:25:01,470
which leads me to believe that what
we're dealing with here is not murder.

292
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,539
It's something else.
It's possibly even a suicide pact.

293
00:25:05,617 --> 00:25:08,450
You're gonna have to
prove that to me.

294
00:25:16,695 --> 00:25:19,926
[ Groaning ]

295
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:26,229
[Arguing]

296
00:25:37,749 --> 00:25:41,310
Not Samantha!

297
00:25:41,386 --> 00:25:45,254
[Yelling Continues]
No, not my baby!

298
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,834
Guard!

299
00:25:58,337 --> 00:26:00,305
Guard!

300
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:03,306
I need to talk to someone!

301
00:26:05,377 --> 00:26:07,311
Guard!

302
00:26:13,752 --> 00:26:15,686
According
to the corrections officer,

303
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:18,188
Agent Mulder kept
everybody awake last night.

304
00:26:18,257 --> 00:26:20,191
He's demanding
to talk to you.

305
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:22,227
He finally shut up
about an hour ago.

306
00:26:22,294 --> 00:26:24,319
Did he say about what?

307
00:26:24,396 --> 00:26:27,695
I think your partner's memories
are coming back to him.

308
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:39,304
I need to talk to him alone
if you don't mind.

309
00:26:47,653 --> 00:26:49,712
I heard you didn't
get much sleep.

310
00:26:49,788 --> 00:26:52,120
I didn't kill those people.
Scully.

311
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,124
I know that.

312
00:26:54,192 --> 00:26:58,458
I think I've gathered enough evidence of
your innocence to get you out of here.

313
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:02,364
- From where?
- The forensics reports.

314
00:27:02,434 --> 00:27:07,462
The shirt you were wearing did
have the victims' blood on it,

315
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:11,999
but the blood splatter pattern doesn't
match the point-of-entry detail.

316
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,374
In fact, Detective Curtis
and his team...

317
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:16,640
have been able to put together
enough contradictory evidence...

318
00:27:16,748 --> 00:27:18,716
to make a statement
to the press...

319
00:27:18,817 --> 00:27:22,753
saying the Cassandras' death
was as a result of a murder-suicide.

320
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:26,257
- But I was there.
- Yes.

321
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:28,623
And I still don't remember why.

322
00:27:28,694 --> 00:27:30,958
I think I have an idea
about that too.

323
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:34,692
Amy Cassandra believed
she was an alien abductee.

324
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:39,430
- And I contacted her?
- Yes. Apparently.

325
00:27:39,504 --> 00:27:41,438
According to an article
I read on Amy,

326
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:46,944
she had begun psychiatric treatment that
was effectively recovering her past.

327
00:27:47,012 --> 00:27:50,812
The repetitive behavior exhibited
in those paintings that we saw...

328
00:27:50,882 --> 00:27:52,816
was an expression
of that treatment.

329
00:27:52,884 --> 00:27:55,944
But why shoot herself
and her husband?

330
00:27:56,021 --> 00:27:58,046
I can't say
definitively,

331
00:27:58,123 --> 00:28:00,455
but judging from an almost
identical suicide...

332
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:04,393
of a police officer who was receiving
the same psychiatric care,

333
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:08,900
I believe the victims were suffering
from Waxman-Geshwin syndrome.

334
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:11,060
The symptoms of which
are trance-like states...

335

about the past,;

than the conscious mind can recall.

337
00:28:17,676 --> 00:28:19,610
It's also called
Dostoyevsky's syndrome...

338
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:22,179
because the Russian novelist
was suffering from it too.

My name is Fox Mulder.

Yes, we're investigating
the deaths of Amy and David Cassandra.

We understand that Amy
was a patient of yours?

Yes.
Please, sit down.

358
00:29:45,063 --> 00:29:47,793
I was very upset
to learn about Amy.

359
00:29:47,866 --> 00:29:51,461
She was a troubled woman
who'd struggled through...

360
00:29:51,536 --> 00:29:53,868
an unfortunate period
of darkness in her life.

361
00:29:53,939 --> 00:29:57,272
Are you referring to her belief
that she was an abductee?

362
00:29:57,342 --> 00:29:59,276
This term "alien abductee"--

363
00:29:59,344 --> 00:30:01,835
Although I recognize there is
an associated syndrome...

364
00:30:01,947 --> 00:30:06,008
and a rather remarkable collection
of shared experiences...

365
00:30:06,118 --> 00:30:08,052
for those who believe
in the phenomena,

366
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,145
my treat of Amy was simply
an aggressive method...

367
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:12,884
to access buried
or repressed memories.

368
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:14,983
How do you mean
"aggressive"?

369
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:19,554
I use a method of therapy that simulates
an electrical impulse in the brain...

370
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:21,565
using light and sound.

371
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:25,194
Did you also use this treatment on
a police officer named Michael Fazekus?

372
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:29,263
- Yes. Why?
- Mr. Fazekus shot himself in the head.

373
00:30:29,341 --> 00:30:31,707
Oh, my God.

374
00:30:31,776 --> 00:30:33,512

of medical treatment?

Is this an accepted form

376
00:30:35,147 --> 00:30:38,139
It's unconventional,
but it's not invasive.

377
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:41,652
Are you familiar with
Waxman-Geshwin syndrome, Dr. Goldstein?

378
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,281
- Yes.
- Did you know Amy suffered from it?

379
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:48,622
Waxman-Geshwin,
if you know anything about it,

380
00:30:48,693 --> 00:30:51,423
is not necessarily
a destructive condition.

381
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,657
In fact, Amy,
after undergoing treatment,

382
00:30:53,765 --> 00:30:57,667
experienced periods of extreme
happiness and creativity.

383

Is that how much
this means to you?

508
00:41:49,854 --> 00:41:53,221
Mulder, listen to me. You have
been given a powerful hallucinogen.

509
00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:56,988
You don't know that
these memories are yours.

510

This is not the way
to the truth, Mulder.

511
00:42:04,836 --> 00:42:08,431
- You've got to trust me.
- Shut up!

512
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:10,337
Put down the gun.

Although cleared of any wrongdoing...

00:43:10,134 --> 00:43:12,534
in the deaths
of Amy and David Cassandra,

518
00:43:12,603 --> 00:43:16,562
Agent Mulder still has no recollection
of the events that led to their deaths.

His seizures have subsided with no
evidence of permanent cerebral damage,

521
00:43:24,348 --> 00:43:28,284

will have a lasting effect.

523
00:43:30,688 --> 00:43:35,284
Agent Mulder under took this treatment
hoping to lay claim to his past,;

524
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,793
that by retrieving
memories lost to him,

525
00:43:37,862 --> 00:43:41,423
he might finally understand
the path he's on.

526
00:43:41,499 --> 00:43:43,933
But if that knowledge
remains elusive,

527
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:46,333
and if it's only by knowing
where he's been...

528
00:43:46,404 --> 00:43:49,373
that he can hope to understand
where he's going,

529
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,807
then I fear Agent Mulder
may lose his course...

530
00:43:52,877 --> 00:43:57,780
and the truth she's seeking from his
childhood will continue to evade him,

driving him more dangerously forward
in impossible pursuit.
