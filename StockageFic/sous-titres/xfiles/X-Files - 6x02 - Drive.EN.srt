[ Sighs ] Well, I think I have a loose
theory as to what caused this.

491
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,113
- Well, lay it on me.
- Okay.

492
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:06,445
Mulder, you know what
E.L.F. waves are ?

493
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:09,077
- Extremely low frequency
radio transmissions ?
- Yeah.

494
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:11,280
It uses an antenna,
like, 50 miles long.

495
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,585
The military uses it to communicate
with the trident submarine.

496
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,592
Project Seafarer,
Project Haarp.

497
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,855
Well, Seafarer has
an antenna array...

498
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,590
stretching beneath the edge
of Patrick Crump's property.

499
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,963
Now, E.L.F. fields
have been shown...

500
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,628
to produce biological effects
in human tissue--

501
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:29,298
inducing electrical currents,
altering chemical reactions.

502
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,466
Not to mention that it's
a potential weapons application.

503
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:33,702
It's been referred to as
""electrical nerve gas,""

504
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,870
or may be behind
the so-called ""Taos Hum.""

505
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,813
What if some overload--
some-some hum from this system...

506
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:42,319
could somehow match the resonant
frequency of the human skull ?

507
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:45,116
I mean, what if it could
induce a like hum...

508
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:48,852
that could somehow exert
a rising pressure...

509
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:51,451
on the labyrinth of the inner ear,
in a sense shattering it ?

510
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:55,727
But with constant movement
somehow ameliorating that
pressure, making it bearable.

511
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,791
But why only
westward movement ?

512
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:59,995
I don't know, Mulder.
I don't know. I mean--

513
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:03,802
I mean, maybe it has to follow certain
lines of force, electrical or magnetic.

514
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:07,344
But the big question, Scully,
is what do we do about it ?

515
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:11,347
Well, I think I know, Mulder, but it's
nothing that Mr. Crump is gonna like.

516
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:22,284
We'll be there.

517
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,419
What ?

518
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,487
Well, whether they did this to you
intentionally or not, you were right.

519
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,533
They did it to you.

520
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,829
So what do we--
what do we do ?

521
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:38,772
Your one chance is that we meet
my partner at the end of the highway.

522
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:42,312
There, she will insert a long,
large-bore needle into your inner ear,

523
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:44,643
<i>hopefully relieving</i>
<i>the pressure.</i>

524
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,047
<i>And when we get there,</i>
<i>she's gonna have to work fast.</i>

525
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:49,052
She's only gonna have
one chance.

526
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,054
She's not gonna be able
to use any anesthetic,

527
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,886
<i>and it will probably</i>
<i>leave you deaf.</i>

528
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:58,961
But I'll live, right ?

529
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:04,798
Well, that's what
it's all about.

530
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,803
All right, man,
let's do it.

531
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:17,314
Mr. Mulder, could you go
a little faster, please ?

532
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:20,246
- <i>Just a little more is all I need.</i>
- Sure.

533
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,292
Just a little bit faster.

I'll bill

You too obviously relish

Okay, so are we done here ?

546
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:21,731

huge piles of manure ?

Sir, Agent Mulder
has been through a lot.

550
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:45,114
And you apologize for him a lot.
I've noticed that about you.

551
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:48,022
I'm not apologizing
for this.

552
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:50,060
Because of his work,

has saved lives.

I don't see you proving that.
The Department of Defense...

556
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:00,734
admits no culpability
whatsoever.

557
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:04,638
Furthermore, they say the closing
of the facility was coincidental.

558
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:08,210
Right.

559
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,675
Don't misunderstand me,
