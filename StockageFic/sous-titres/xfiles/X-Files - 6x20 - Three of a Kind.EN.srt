00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:23,108
You can bring a horse to water,
but you can't make her drink.

331
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,777
She would not marry
that man.

332
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:28,046
<i>You don't know him</i>
<i>like I do.</i>

333
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,682
How'd you get in here ?

334
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:34,675
One of you left this
in my room.

335
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:38,823
Grant Ellis saved my life.
He saved the lives of thousands.

336
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:42,127
- [ Scoffs ]
- I need to talk to you,John.

337
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:45,463
I need to try
and explain everything.

338
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:49,467
Come on.
Let's hit the slots.

339
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:53,460
Watch your back.

340
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:57,665
Mata Hari.

341
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,046
You said something
about a friend being murdered.

342
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:04,482
- <i>[ Door Closes ]</i>
- Not that I can prove it.

343
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:08,475
But I think he saw something he was not
supposed to see at your conference.

344
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:14,014
- You may be in danger.
- I am always.

345
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:18,252
So is Grant.

346
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:25,325
I have thought about
this moment so many times.

347
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,963
All the things I would say to you
if I ever saw you again.

348
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,113
And then there you were
at my door,

349
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:39,106
and I--

350
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:46,280
They took me ten years ago.

351
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,960
They did things to me.

352
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,953
And it was like drowning
every day underwater,

353
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,301
struggling to breathe.

354
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,803
And one day a hand
broke the surface,

355
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:02,807
reached down
and pulled me up.

356
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:06,211
I wanted it to be you,John.

357
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:09,247
It was Grant.

358
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,016
He worked for them--
the project.

359
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:15,453
I didn't trust him,
not for years,

360
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:19,446
not until I realized that he was working
against them in his own way.

361
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:23,851
Stalling them,
sabotaging their tests.

362
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:29,022
He reminded me of you.

363
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:32,904
- They're just lucky I got a conscience.
- How's that ?

364
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,073
If I unleash my true kung fu
on this casino,

365
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,208
I could break the bank
within a week.

366
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:40,211
Yeah, and find yourself buried
under six feet of desert dirt.

367
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,480
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Timmy.

368
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,582
I'm sorry aboutJimmy.

369
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,584
Hey, Langly ?

370
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,888
The guys are all up in my room for
a round of Dungeons and Dragons...

371
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,090
in honor ofJimmy.

372
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:56,083
Lord Manhammer
will be in attendance.

373
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,998
I'm gonna go play
a little D&D in memoriam.

374
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,000
That's touching, man.

375
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,993
<i>[ Woman Laughing Loudly ]</i>

376
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:22,476
- <i>[ Laughter Continues ]</i>
- You like penthouses ?

377
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:33,464
- Scully ?
- Oh !

378
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:37,457
Hey, Hickey.
Long time no see.

379
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:41,528
- [ Whispering ]
- No, that's not nice. I like Hickey.

380
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:52,539
Cigarette ?

381
00:30:57,288 --> 00:31:00,491
You don't smoke.

382
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:04,484
But who's got a match ?

383
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,266
Well...

384
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:12,259
I just can't decide
who lights my fire.

385
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,976
That's it.
All right, you dandies, back off.

386
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:20,612
This is Special Agent Dana Scully
of the F.B.I.

387
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:23,147
If you so much as touch her,
you may be committing a federal offense.

388
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:26,951
Come on. Come on.

389
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,220
We could have been stardust.

390
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,213
- Maybe next time.
- [ Slaps Bottom ]

391
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,162
Ooh.

392
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:42,155
<i>I hope you brought your wallet,</i>
<i>my friend. Just because</i>
<i>this is a memorial game</i>--

393
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,393
- What's this ?
- Oh, we have got a game for you.

394
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:52,466
Trust me.
This is gonna work.

395
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,614
- You didn't tape this ?
- No.

396
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:59,350
Which means
they surveilled us.

397
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,519
They know our plans.
They know everything.

398
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,989
- What is your plan ?
- To escape.

399
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:08,326
This conference was our chance
to slip out on the last day--

400
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:12,319
go public with our files,
all our weapons research.

401
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,501
[ Sighs ] We could finally
make it happen this time.

402
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,437
We'd gathered up
enough proof.

403
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:23,430
The public is ready
to believe now more than ever.

404
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:28,212
They know everything.

405
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:32,050
They'll kill us,John--
Grant and me both.

406
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:36,020
- [ Laughing ] Hi !
- Come on. Come on.

407
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,957
- Come on. Settle down. Settle down.
- Okay, okay, okay.

408
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,950
I found Agent Scully Go-Lightly
holding court in the bar.

409
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:46,664
I've never seen her
drunk before.

410
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,267
God. This can't be.

411
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:53,260
- [ Chuckles ] Hi.
- Please.

412
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,643
She's not drunk.
Look at this.

413
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,012
That was made
by an injector gun.

414
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:04,382
What the hell
was she injected with ?

415
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,718
It's a derivative
of E-H gas.

416
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,787
A-H. Anoetic histamine.
My latest creation.

417
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:13,624
I could have developed it
years ago, but I held off.

418
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:17,095
I wasn't about to let those bastards
I work for get their hands on it.

419
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:20,465
Grant thought that if we
secretly developed a small batch...

420
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:24,458
and then destroyed the notes, we would
have the proof we needed to go public.

421
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,238
We'd also have a weapon
we could use against them.

422
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,674
Who else has access
to this anoetic histamine ?

423
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:33,667
<i>Grant and I are the only</i>
<i>two people that have</i>--

424
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:41,341
that have the samples.

425
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:47,191
This will counteract
the anoetic effect.

426
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,193
Hey, cutie.

427
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:52,296
Ow !

428
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:56,289
Just a little prick.

429
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,507
- Bad trip ?
- She'll be fine.

430
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:05,443
- She just needs to sleep it off.
- I don't understand.

431
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:08,346
Why would the government want
to turn Scully into a bimbo ?

432
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,348
That's just
a potential side effect.

433
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:13,684
Anoetic histamine impedes
higher brain functions.

434
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,686
It promotes suggestibility.

435
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,089
Mind control.
Brainwashing.

436
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:21,392
That explains Jimmy.
They told him to commit suicide.

437
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:25,385
And Scully. They made her forget
her autopsy findings.

438
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:30,490
<i>But what is their larger purpose ?</i>
<i>What are they planning ?</i>

439
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:37,064
Well, whatever it is,
we better find out fast.

441
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:51,078

00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,394
This is your weapon.

443
00:34:56,394 --> 00:35:00,387
All you do
is pull the trigger.

00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:03,901
You will enter the Saguaro Room

Take a seat
toward the back and wait.

At 1 0:1 5,
a break will be called.

448
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,579
Rise, approach the target,

449
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,315
and fire three shots.

450
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,485
<i>This brings us to the notion</i>
<i>of acceptable risk.</i>

451
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:24,355
Of course,
risk is defined as exposure...

<i>A combination of political instability</i>
<i>and lack of efficient infrastructure...</i>

No, Susanne.
It wasn't my idea.

You gave it to them--

to check Langly--
