- OK.

- See you tomorrow.
- <i>(man)</i> Clean up your stations!

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,193
<i>(man)... get some information</i>

7
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,434
<i>This is pretty direct information that came</i>
<i>from an informant who made a buy and...</i>

8
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,517
<i>It's that direct.</i>
<i>It's easy to get a search warrant...</i>

- <i>(youth)</i> Hey.
- Hey? All I get is "Hey"?

12
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,471
Hey, Mom.

13
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,877
I'm gonna take a quick shower. You guys
interested in getting a pizza delivered?

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,635
- <i>(son grunts)</i>
- If that was a yes, you can call the order in.

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,711
And no pepperoni for me.

00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,548

Hello?

19
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,591
Oh. Yeah. Sure.

20
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,917
- Ow!
- I'll be back in five minutes. OK, butt-crumb?

21
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,032
He said he was only gonna be gone five
minutes and that was over four hours ago.

22
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,348
Yes.

23
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,829
No, I don't know who called him.

24
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,672
The last person to see him?
His younger brother.

25
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,713
<i>(police radio) What's your 10-3? Over.</i>

26
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,791
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,391
Gary?

28
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,471
Gary Kane?

29
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,156
Go get him a blanket.

30
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,115
It's gonna be OK, son.
Hey! We're here to help you.

31
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,069
Hey! What's wrong?

32
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,915
Oh, my God!

33
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,312
Gary Kane: 16 years old, high-school junior...

34
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,554
...C student, first-string varsity football,
member of the local 4-H Club.

35
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,031
Not one of Wisconsin's more remarkable
kids, but still the apple of his mother's eye.

36
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,192
- What does that mean?
- Nobody knows.

37
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,671
- What does the police report say?
- He received a phone call and left his home.

38
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,550
He was discovered in the woods 12 hours
later. He's been unable to give a statement.

39
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,995
- Any evidence of sexual assault?
- No.

40
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,196
Does it seem like a schoolboy prank?

41
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,273
The other victims have had to be sedated
and hospitalised since their ordeals.

42
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,912
- They were reportedly hysterical with fear.
- Victims? You mean there have been others?

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,833
One in eastern Wisconsin,
one three towns away.

44
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,356
Both with the same words
written in black Magic Marker.

45
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,029
- What's your interest in this?
- The sheriff in Delta Glen, Wisconsin...

46
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,032
...thinks he knows
what's been happening to these kids.

47
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,795
- What's that?
- He thinks they've been possessed.

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,833
<i>(sheriff)</i> There's something
I think you oughta see first.

49
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,229
They're called
the Church of the Red Museum.

50
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,632
They're followers of a guy, Odin, that moved
here three years ago and bought a ranch.

51
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,840
- What's the significance of the name?
- Odin and the rest of 'em are vegetarians.

52
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,277
They drove the ranch right into the ground,
turned 500 head of beef cattle into pets.

53
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,351
He calls it a monument to barbarism.

54
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,557
Probably went over big
with the local ranchers.

55
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:57,795
It takes some big ones to set down
in cow country and start a church like his.

56
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,513
Kinda stick out like a sore thumb, don't they?

57
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,835
Sheriff, from what you've told us...

58
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,072
...they seem unlikely to be involved
in the kind of activities you described.

59
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,278
Well, I... I won't say another word.
You can just see for yourself.

60
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,271
That's Odin.

61
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,635
<i>(types)</i>

62
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,710
Today is a blessing from our
Lord and Master, who awaits his flock...

63
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,634
...in this time,
the dawning of the Age of Aquarius...

64
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,199
...18 earth years from
the beginning of the New Kingdom.

65
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,199
The Guides speak through me today
as messengers of the Word...

66
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,273
...that we may be free from death
and the passage into spirit.

67
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,718
As the acceleration continues,
we, the enlightened...

68
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,112
...must bring the teachings of
the skills for survival to mankind.

69
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,790
- They're walk-ins.
- What are "walk-ins"?

70
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,599
<i>(woman)</i> We, the second souls
of the first bodies...

71
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,877
<i>(all)</i> We, the second souls
of the first bodies...

72
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,988
<i>(woman)...</i> bearers of the Word and keepers
of the sacraments of a new enlightenment...

73
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,790
Believers in soul transference. Spirits who've
taken possession of other people's bodies.

74
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,919
- <i>(woman)</i> Blessed mission and toil.
- <i>(all)</i> Blessed mission and toil.

75
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,676
Our struggle is transcendent,
and your guidance, our Guides...

76
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,197
Our struggle is transcendent,
and your guidance, our Guides...

77
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,192
<i>(woman)...</i> will carry us
toward the dawning of a new age.

78
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,273
<i>(all)...</i> will carry us
toward the dawning of a new age.

79
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,475
Today we bear witness
to three who do not believe.

80
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,993
We encourage them to open their hearts
and minds to our teachings...

81
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,709
...that they who slaughter the flesh...

82
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,749
...slaughter their own souls,
and must be taught the way.

83
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,274
<i>(Gary)</i> I only remember parts of it.

84
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,749
Which parts are those?

85
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,400
I was in the woods, and...

86
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,836
...I felt... a spirit enter me.

87
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,430
When you say "spirit", Gary,
I'm not sure what you mean.

88
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,071
It...

89
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,958
It might have been an animal spirit.

90
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,189
I can't explain it.

91
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,911
Something...

92
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,755
...just came over me.

93
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,193
And you don't remember who called you?

94
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:57,276
Anything at all about what happened
immediately after you left home that night?

95
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,751
Have you ever had any dealings with anyone
from the Church of the Red Museum?

96
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,592
I see them around.

97
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,037
Do you have reason to believe that they may
be involved in what happened to you?

98
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,032
<i>(sheriff)</i> Now, tell him
what you told me, Gary.

99
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,512
- Hi.
- Hi.

100
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,636
- Who are you?
- Stevie.

101
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,669
Oh, you're in all the pictures.
You must be Gary's younger brother.

102
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,637
I'm Dana.

103
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,829
Stevie, do you remember who your brother
might have gone out to see the other night?

104
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,469
Did he say anything?

105
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,198
<i>(Mulder)</i> Scully, we'll meet you outside.

106
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,313
- Has this boy ever been in any trouble?
- Gary?

107
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,279
No, I've known him since he was a kid.
He's the same age as my son.

108
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,911
He's done some beer drinking, but he's just
your basic 16-year-old. Least, he was.

109
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,788
- Do you see a notable difference in him?
- Yeah... Yeah.

110
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:05,955
Gary Kane lived for football. He's a damn
good athlete, too. Now he won't even suit up.

111
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,350
The Red Museum - how are they
treated by the local citizens?

112
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,829
- Nobody cares for 'em.
- Are they singled out...

113
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,798
...shop owners refusing
to sell to them, stuff like that?

114
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,556
There's a reasonable amount of tension, but
most folks are happy to just try to avoid 'em.

115
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,313
Can you recommend
a good motel in the area?

116
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,790
Sure. You're staying for a bit.
You think there's something to this?

117
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,713
I wanna run a check
on the church and this guy Odin.

118
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,759
If you could just show us a good motel
and maybe point out a good place to eat.

119
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,637
You've come to the right place.

120
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,429
You know, Mulder, ribs like these...

121
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,877
...I'd say the Church of the Red Museum
has its work cut out for it.

122
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,591
Thanks.

123
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,916
So... you started to tell me about walk-ins,
but I'm not sure if I grasped the finer points.

124
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,878
It's kind of a New Age religion
based on an old idea...

125
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,953
...that if you lose hope or despair
and wanna leave this mortal coil...

126
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,589
...you become open and vulnerable.
- To inhabitation by a new spirit.

127
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,753
A new <i>enlightened</i> spirit. According to
the literature, Abe Lincoln was a walk-in.

128
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,674
And Mikhail Gorbachev.
And Charles Colson, Nixon's adviser.

129
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,957
- But not Nixon?
- No. Not even <i>they</i> wanna claim Nixon.

130
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,838
So, are you still subscribing
to the sheriff's claims of a possession?

131
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:33,029
I don't know. In the absence of any other
plausible explanation, it's a novel theory.

132
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,428
Well, I feel kinda weird saying this,
but I got the creeps in that apartment.

133
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,837
- Really?
- <i>(youth)</i> Towel-head! Whoo-hoo!

134
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,198

- <i>(youth)</i> Turn around, man. Hey!

135
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,592

136
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,472
- Hey, diaper-head! We're talking to you, man.
- <i>(girl)</i> How's your pet cow?

137
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,235
- Did you get any milk out of him?
- We're talking to you, Aladdin.

138
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,513
What's the matter, diaper-head, huh? Huh?

139
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,909
- Nothing.
- Leave him alone.

140
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,116
Leave him alone. Go home.

141
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,789
Go ahead, go home.

142
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,674
- Catch you later, Red.
- You got a problem?

143
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,594
- Yeah. But who asked <i>you?</i>
- I see four against one. <i>I got a problem.

00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:26,197
Yeah, well, why don't you run along with the
little wife? You're gonna miss the tour bus.

146
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,271
She's got a gun.

147
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,590
What's she gonna do? Shoot us? Go call my
dad, Katie. I think he'd like to hear about this.

148
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,195
- Who's your dad?
- He's the sheriff.

149
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,435
- I think he <i>would</i> like to hear about this.
- Come on. Let's just get out of here, Rick.

150
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,068
Kinda hard to tell the villains
without a scorecard.

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,759
...and call me back -
at this number, or on my cellular.

162
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,832
- I just examined the girl.
- What d'you find?

163
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,313
Not much until
the toxicology report came back.

164
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:08,315
They found traces of an unspecified alkaloid
substance in her blood, possibly an opiate...

165
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,109
...and a dangerously large quantity
of something called scopolamine.

166
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,112
- The stuff they use for motion sickness?
- In small dosages.

167
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,274
Anything past.2 micrograms and you've got
a powerful anaesthetic and hallucinogen.

168
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,354
It's been in the news because Colombian
gangs have been using it in kidnappings.

169
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,955
- Is it a controlled substance?
- You'd probably have to be a doctor...

170
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,873
...to get a hold of these quantities.

171
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,908
Richard Odin, also known
as Doug Herman, left AMA in 1986...

172
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,709
...over questionable ethics inquiry.
Did not renew licence.

173
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,109
I'll drive.

174
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,352
I'm Special Agent Fox Mulder.
We're with the FBI.

175
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,672
- We'd like to speak to Richard Odin. Is he in?
- Just a moment.

176
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,112
Mr Odin? We'd like to ask you
some questions. May we come inside?

177
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,476
I'm sorry. I can't allow you in this house.

178
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,515
- We can get a warrant if that's what it takes.
- You can, but you will not enter the building.

179
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,194
- Well, how's that?
- Because you're meat eaters.

180
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,590
The building cannot be
desecrated by your presence.

181
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,433
I believe I am within
my religious rights to prevent it.

182
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,239
You can't hide behind them
if a crime has been committed.

183
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,356
Have I been accused of a crime?

184
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,431
<i>(low droning)</i>

185
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,910
We can always determine that elsewhere.
Can you step outside please, sir?

186
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,949
Can you step outside, Mr Odin?
We're placing you under arrest.

187
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,031
Are you familiar with
a substance called scopolamine?

188
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,635
Are you familiar with inhumane treatment
of beef and dairy cattle?

189
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,280
Just answer the question, Mr Odin.

190
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,350
Yes, I know it.

191
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,716
But I've never prescribed it
or administered it.

192
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,598
- Have you ever ordered others to do so?
- No.

193
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,958
Do your beliefs preclude you from
exacting revenge, physically or psychically...

194
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,952
...on those who might not share them?

195
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,673
- The barbarians will be cleansed...
- Answer the question! You did it, didn't you?

196
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,957
- You did something to those kids!
- <i>(Mulder)</i> Sheriff.

197
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,989
We've already had to go through this once
with your kid. If you'll just take a walk.

198
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,353
<i>(man)</i> Sheriff, come here a second.

199
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,718
For a holy man, you've got
quite a knack for pissing people off.

200
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,838
We got problems down the street.

201
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,311
<i>(woman)</i> Keep your minds open
to the wisdom of the Guides.

202
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:59,236
All we ask is that you listen. Question
what we say, and consider it seriously.

203
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,311
All right, man. Let's do it.

204
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,552
End the slaughter. The rights
of the just must be protected...

205
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,074
...just as the barbarism must cease.

206
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,630
Violence against nature
begets violence against man.

207
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,109
How about a little cow blood?

208
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,509
<i>(whistling and cheering)</i>

209
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,195
What do you think you're doin'?!
Get outta here! Get! Get!

210
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,392
<i>(sheriff)</i> Get in the truck!

211
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,678
- <i>(woman)</i> They asked for it.
- <i>(man)</i> They asked for it. That's right.

212
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,278
- You the FBI agents?
- Yes.

213
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,038
I got something I'd like to show you.

214
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,829
This pasture land...
belonged to my granddad.

215
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,594
He bought it in 1890.

216
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,673
He died right over there,
next to that cattle pen.

217
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,595
82 years old.
Just... fell off the tractor one morning.

218
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,757
My dad worked this piece
for the next 40 years.

219
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,311
And I put in 25 myself
before I decided to call it quits.

220
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,190
Sold it for 80 times what my granddad paid.

221
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,598
- Why'd you sell it?
- Business changed.

222
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,398
- People changed, too.
- In what way?

223
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:12,479
Competition. Used to get by with
50 milk cows. Now you gotta have 500.

224
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,509
Used to turn 'em out to pasture. Now
you keep 'em in pens and grain-feed 'em.

225
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,511
- You said you wanted to show us something.
- You're looking at it.

226
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,955
See those men over there?

227
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:30,512
They're injecting the cattle with something
called BST - bovine somatotropin.

228
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,074
- A genetically engineered growth hormone.
- Shoot 'em up...

229
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:41,156
...and a cow'll produce ten per cent more milk.
Feed it to beef cattle, more meat on the hoof.

230
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,153
Changed the business.
Changed a whole lot of things.

231
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,355
How do you mean?

232
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,035
Well, that, uh, fracas in town this afternoon.

233
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,031
Ten, even five years ago,
never woulda happened.

234
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:03,875
People around here have changed, you know.
They've gotten mean, spiteful. Dog eat dog.

235
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,230
We had seven rapes here last year.

236
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,470
By high-school boys.

237
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:17,237
Well, that, um... This business
of the kids being found in the woods.

238
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,030
Well, I think that you're going to find
it all comes from the same root source.

239
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,434
- The growth hormone?
- Yes, sir.

240
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,228
But those hormones have been proven safe.
They've been cleared by the FDA.

241
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,835
Says who? The government?

242
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,790
<i>(misfiring plane engine)</i>

243
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,436
I don't know, Doc.
I'm losing oil pressure like crazy.

244
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,717
- I don't know what's goin' on.
- How far are we from the airport?

245
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,998
We're not gonna make it. I'm gonna
have to find someplace to put it down.

246
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,671
Look out!

247
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,112
- We're still trying to ID the pilot.
- What about the second body?

248
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,555
That's Dr Jerrold Larson.

249
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,791
- Did you know him?
- Yeah... He delivered my kid.

250
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,557
There's something else over here
I want you to see.

251
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,191
<i>(Scully)</i> Thank you.

252
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,475
It looks like the doctor
may have been delivering more than babies.

253
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,949
That's why I brought you out here.

254
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,635
- Any clue what this is about?
- I have no idea.

255
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,190
Jerry Larson was a pillar in this town,
the last of the country doctors.

256
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,590
Wherever he was coming from,
that was one hell of a house call.

257
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,875
This has nothing to do with those kids?

258
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,350
I think we'll know more
once we find out what this is.

259
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,149
You're sure? Both kids?

260
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,716
No, it's OK. I'm sure you're correct.
Thank you very much.

261
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,268
Scully, you're not gonna believe this.

262
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,272
The out-of-town kids
and the kids abducted here -

263
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,035
every one was delivered and treated
through childhood by Dr Larson.

264
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,238
The print-outs we found were shipping
orders, along with credit card numbers...

265
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,357
...each number corresponding
to a card in the victim's family.

266
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,750
- Why would he carry credit card numbers?
- Maybe to track them...

267
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,115
...the way companies track stolen cards.

268
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,272
But why? And what was he
treating them for?

269
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,234
What was he treating them <i>with?</i>

270
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:43,077
I don't know. We won't get the test results
back on the vial until tomorrow.

271
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,555
You think it's bovine growth hormone?

272
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,837
That was the first thing through our minds,
but it doesn't track.

273
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,276
- Not with that case full of cash.
- It doesn't answer the question...

274
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,558
...about who's marking those kids... or why.

275
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,111
Away with you.

276
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,399
- So, I'll see you in the morning.
- Yeah. 8.30 sharp.

277
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,431
Howdy.

278
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,033
Hi. Sorry to come unannounced.

279
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,673
Gary's not home right now.

280
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,228
Actually, we wanted to talk with <i>you,</i>
if that's OK.

281
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,151
I don't know what to say. You think Dr Larson
was doing some kind of tests on Gary?

282
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,233
Well, thinking back, was there anything
that seemed strange to you?

283
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,709
- Was Gary sick often?
- No...

284
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,155
Gary's never been sick a day in his life.

285
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,515
Gary was never sick?

286
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,194
- No.
- Why was he going to Dr Larson?

287
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,639
Dr Larson gave him vitamin shots.
He gave them to a lot of kids.

288
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,633
He said it was like treating teeth with fluoride,
as a preventative measure.

289
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:53,033
- Did you ever take Gary to another doctor?
- No. Jay had wanted to.

290
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,670
Jay's your husband?

291
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,309
Yes. He was concerned Gary wasn't growing.

292
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,359
Jay was six five. He wanted
Gary to play college ball.

293
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,236
- But then there was Jay's accident.
- What accident?

294
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,472
It was seven years ago.
He worked at the packing plant.

295
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,632
He had an accident
with one of the machines.

296
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,228
Excuse me. What is this?

297
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,391
What?

298
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,832
- This light here.
- I don't know.

299
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,119
There's something back there.

300
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,669
What is it, Mulder?

301
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,116

private little movie studio.

Go and keep him from

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,431
What?

323
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,717
That's quite a video library
you've compiled for yourself.

324
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,792
I especially like the ones with the little boys.

325
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,711
I know.

326
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,510
I'm... a sick man.

327
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,878
No. No, men who know
they're sick try to get help.

328
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,793
You just kept right at it for years.

329
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,599
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

330
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,749
Did you kidnap those kids?

331
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,836
Yes.

332
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,912
Are you prepared to confess to those crimes?

333
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,759
- Yes.
- And to the murder of Rick Mazeroski?

334
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,831
No.

335
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,834
I never murdered anybody.

336
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,349
Did you kidnap Rick Mazeroski?

337
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,035
Did you write this on his back?!

338
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,909
- Oh, my God!
- Answer the question.

339
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,958
No, I... I never killed him.

340
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,716
I never killed anybody. I...

341
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,951
- I really love those kids.
- Is this how you express your love for them?

342
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,277
- Did you kidnap Rick and write on his back?
- Yes!

343
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,794
- Why?
- Because of what he'd become.

344
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:31,000
- What had he become?
- Because those kids have become monsters.

345
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,789
You're not making any sense.
Now... make sense to me.

346
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,833
Because of Dr Larson
and because of the tests.

347
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,391
Excuse me.

348
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,351
OK, what tests?

349
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,878
Dr Larson was using those kids
as guinea pigs. And he was using us, too.

350
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,589
- What do you mean, using you?
- To inoculate the cattle.

351
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,150
- With growth hormone?
- I don't know exactly what it was.

352
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,595
But he was paying us a lot of money to do it.

353
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:24,629
He was paying you to inject the cattle with
something and you didn't know what it was?

354
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,554
Not until later.
Not until after all those rapes and...

355
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:37,236
Dr Larson told my boss he felt responsible
for everything that those kids have done...

356
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,717
...and that he was giving them
the same inoculations.

357
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,076
- Was Dr Larson involved in the kidnapping?
- No.

358
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,152
No. He didn't want his secret to come out.

359
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,392
He didn't care about those kids like me.

360
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,751
- Mulder?
- Mm-hm?

361
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,315
I... think he's telling the truth.

362
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,312
- I don't think he killed anyone.
- How can you be sure?

363
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,428
I just got the toxicology report back on
the vial. The residue couldn't be analysed...

364
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,230
...because it contained synthetic
corticosteroids with unknown amino acids.

365
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,151
That's purity control.

366
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,798
Do you know what you're saying, Scully?

367
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,758
He was inoculating those kids
with antibodies...

368
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,673
...derived from what may be
an extraterrestrial source.

369
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,072
- He's been injecting them with alien DNA.
- No, Mulder. That was never proven.

370
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,833
It's the same substance
as in the Erlenmeyer flask.

371
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,878
- The same material Deep Throat died for.
- Yes.

372
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,236
It all makes sense.
They've been conducting an experiment.

373
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,359
Somebody's been paying to have
those kids injected with alien DNA.

374
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,432
- It's been going on for years.
- Does that man know about it?

375
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,196
No. He just blew their cover. I don't think
he knows any more than he's telling us.

376
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,114
His boss must have. They found him
shot to death in a cow pasture.

377
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,034
- What?!
- I think I know who shot him, Mulder.

378
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,396
That man that I recognised on the road today.

379
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,393
That's the same man
that executed Deep Throat.

380
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,439
Well, whoever's behind this,
he's here covering their tracks.

381
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,310
He's gonna go after the kids. Get the sheriff
and meet me at Gary Kane's apartment.

382
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,995
And Scully... I want this guy alive.

383
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,071
<i>(knocks at door)</i>

384
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,070
- Where's Gary?
- He's in his bedroom.

385
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,038
Go pack some clothes.
You're all coming with me.

386
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,509
- What?!
- I'll explain later.

387
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,553
Those credit card numbers.
Every kid's family listed, get them packed up.

388
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,633
- Call out every man you've got.
- Where are we taking them?

389
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,911
- I need your help.
- For?

390
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,393
It may offend your religious sensibilities,
but it could help save some kids' lives.

391
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,231
<i>(Scully)</i> Sheriff?

392
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,591
Where's Mulder?

393
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,994
He told me to make sure the kids were safe.

394
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,312
He thought there was
some other place this guy might be.

395
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,231
Stop right there!

396
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,756
Hey!

397
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,111
<i>(Scully)</i> Don't move!

398
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,274
Put it down. Now!

399
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,233
Just put the lighter down.

<i>(gun clicks)</i>

403
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,717
Get him outta here. Get everyone outta here.

404
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,997
