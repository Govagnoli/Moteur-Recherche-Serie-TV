that comes with this knowledge.

345
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,942
Don't try me, old man!

346
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,474
I gave you responsibility.
I gave you a position.

347
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,848
I gave you the things that you couldn't
get yourself, and you can't do the job.

348
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,753
Keeping Fox Mulder down is not a job!
It's your dirty work.

349
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:50,521
You pale to Fox Mulder.

350
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,147
Bet you're curious about C.G.B.

351
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,051
What's that?

352
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:21,058
C.G.B. Spender. His name--
cigarette-smoking man.

353
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:25,192
What's it stand for?

354
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:29,927
-<i>[ Ball Swishes Through Net ]</i>
- It's an alias, as far as I can figure.

355
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,935
One of hundreds.

356
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:35,505
Scully, wanna go one-on-one?

357
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,371
We got nothing but time now that
we're on administrative leave.

358
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:42,140
Aren't you curious
what I've got in the box?

359
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,681
Everything I could find on him.

360
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:48,583
Nothing you could ever find
would be accurate or credible.

361
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:51,121
Maybe.

362
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,817
But there's a picture
you're gonna want to see.

363
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,262
That's C.G.B. Spender...

364
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,270
and my father.

365
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,772
It was taken in 1 973.

366
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:14,107
I traced the connection to something
they worked on together for 25 years...

367
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:17,842
at the State Department--
a highly classified project.

368
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,848
There's more, if you're ready.

369
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:30,226
Cassandra Spender is, indeed,
the mother of AgentJeffrey Spender...

370
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:33,059
and the ex-wife
of C.G.B. Spender.

371
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:37,761
<i>But there's something that you're</i>
<i>gonna be surprised to find out.</i>

372
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,000
She was first abducted in 1 973...

373
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:44,598
on the night of November 27.

374
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,677
That's the same night
as my sister.

375
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,140
And there are other names connected
to C.G.B. Spender and your father--

376
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,846
PhDs, doctors,

377
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,856
one a Nobel winner
for early works in genetics,

378
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,789
a Dr. Eugene Openshaw.

379
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,261
He was the doctor that was found
amongst the burn victims...

380
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,959
clinging to life
beside Cassandra Spender.

381
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,297
He died the next day
in the hospital...

382
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,337
before he was questioned.

383
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,498
- The project is still going on.
- Yeah.

384
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:24,770
<i>If Mulder hadn't known of</i>
<i>his father's history with me,</i>

385
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:29,582
he was fueled now with names
and dates and... certainties.

386
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,657
I couldn't stop him any longer--

387
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,224
stop him from learning our sins,

388
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:42,163
his father's and my own.

389
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,171
The truth was out there...

390
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,173
fatally exposed.

391
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:56,780
I had one last hope,

392
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,878
<i>one chance to preserve my legacy.</i>

393
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:19,903
- I waited, like you asked.
- Good.

394
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,939
I'm pleased.

395
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,744
I was doubtful
after our last meeting.

396
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,179
You have a new job for me?

397
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,981
Yes.

398
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,113
I may have been unduly harsh.

399
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,516
You deserve a fighting chance...

400
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:44,857
to prove your father wrong.

401
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:51,895
- What is it?
- A weapon.

402
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:57,765
A man has infiltrated
the group that I work with.

403
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:01,868
- That's to kill him.
- I don't understand.

404
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,710
He's pretending to be
a member of our group,

405
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:07,376
disguising himself as a man
he's already killed.

406
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:11,920
You will greet him as that man.

407
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,924
Engage him in conversation,

408
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,291
then put that
in the back of his neck.

409
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:29,739
You can do it,Jeffrey.

Sir, my name is Jeffrey Spender.

413
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,567
My father sent me to see you.

414
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:46,782
I have a message from the group.

415
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:50,912
- They've changed their minds?
- That's what I'm here about.

416
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,536
Sit, please.

417
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:15,301
- What have you to tell me?
- Something I've been entrusted with.

418
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:18,405
It's, uh--
It's a name, actually,

419
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:21,008
one that will have
meaning for you.

420
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:29,293
I'm sorry.

You've been forbidden

427
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,670
Sir.

428
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,172
You say Cassandra Spender's
life is in danger.

429
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,176
Her life's been in danger going on
30 years,just not the way it is now.

430
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:21,768
In danger from who?

431
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,246
Men who have conducted
medical experiments...

432
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,442
<i>in what began as a secret</i>
<i>government project,</i>

433
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,542
but what is now the most
private global enterprise.

434
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,314
Enterprising to do what?

435
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:34,187
To develop alien/human hybrids that
will survive the viral apocalypse...

436
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:36,317
when aliens colonize the Earth.

437
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:39,363
And I suppose you
have proof of this?

438
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,421
Files that Agent Scully dug up...

439
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:44,468
that make the right connections
to Dr. Eugene Openshaw,

440
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:48,835
to my sister, to my father,
to Agent Spender's father.

441
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:52,808
- Agent Spender's father?
- The smoking man.

442
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:56,173
- What?
- <i>It's true.</i>

443
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:57,612
We have documented evidence.

444
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:01,448
Then you believe this, Agent Scully?
This whole account?

445
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:05,215
<i>I know that Agent Scully has her doubts</i>
<i>about the purposes of these experiments.</i>

446
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:09,692
I also know that she believes she was
a test subject when she was abducted.

447
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,957
If Cassandra Spender's life
is in danger, why not Scully's?

448
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:16,591
I believe Cassandra Spender represents
the final stages of these experiments--

449
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:20,194
that she may very well be the first
successful alien/human hybrid.

450
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:24,002
What I don't understand is if she was
a success, why is her life threatened?

451
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,010
Because...

452
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,445
the men who created her
would rather kill her...

453
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:34,314
than let her expose
the enterprise.

454
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,717
She's under 2 4-hour guard.

455
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,722
Assigned by Agent Spender?

456
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,432
You've never seen one
before, have you?

457
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,342
It's shocking at first--

458
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:06,474
<i>the acceptance of the idea.</i>

459
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,553
It's something you thought
only children...

460
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,554
and fools believed in.

461
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,887
It undermines your beliefs...

462
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,893
in yourself, in the world.

463
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:21,625
- But then you come to understand.
- Understand what?

464
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:26,033
The responsibility that this knowledge
demands by the men who have it.

465
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:29,738
The great sacrifice...

466
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,867
by great men
like... your father.

467
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,535
What sacrifice?

468
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:37,740
The sacrifice of your mother.

469
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,590
What do you know about that?

470
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:50,650
Just that she's been the subject
of an experiment for 25 years.

471
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:55,532
My father's involved in that?

472
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,067
- Is he?
- Your father directs the experiments.

473
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:04,206
So I'm protecting her now
so the experiments can continue?

474
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:07,642
That's why he put you
on the X-Files.

475
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:14,777
That's why your father
sent you here tonight.

476
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:20,747
You're protecting
the project,Jeffrey,

477
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:25,194
making the sacrifices...

478
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,966
so that you can be a great man too.

479
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,936
I'll be my own great man.

480
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:44,278
I've trusted no one.

481
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:47,613
Treachery is the inevitable result
of all affairs.

Every man believes
he has his own good reason.

483
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:00,726
I have little doubt
of my son's disloyalty to me.

484
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:06,359
Certainly he led
Mulder and Scully to us.

485
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:12,235
His mother must know by now
her central role in the grand plan,

486
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:16,404
that she's as much alien as human.

487
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:23,209
Do you wonder why I've chosen you?

488
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,585
You've never betrayed me.

489
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:29,023
Now I need someone to trust.

490
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,733
