- The only reason I was in there...

is because you assured me there
was a scientific basis for what we saw.

00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:19,131
Let me remind you once again,
what I saw was very little.

I can't identify it.
I have run three separate tests.

82

that virus's D.N.A. and proteins...

83
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,852
are very much
of this world.

84
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,483
I saw what that virus did.
I saw it generate a new being,

86
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:53,430
It attacks and destroys human cells,
but that is all it does.

00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,990
It creates nothing.

00:08:56,102 --> 00:09:00,766
Look, I don't like telling you this, and
I know that you don't want to hear it.

Not that you can't question me
in what I saw,

is the science.

Ah. Somebody broke a nail.

168

- Is it animal?
- It ain't RuPaul.

169
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,452
The body of the other victim
was found here on the sofa,

170
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,925
his viscera torn
from his torso.

171
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:07,657
But the M.E.'s report says that
the times of death were hours apart,

172
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:11,464
which means that this victim was dead
hours before the second attack.

173
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:15,029
- So the attacker never left.
- There wasn't an attack.

174
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,270
I think it was celebrating
its birthday.

00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,177
The first victim must've gotten
infected with the virus somehow.

Right here on the sofa
was where the creature was born.

177

- That would account for the violence
done to the man's torso.

extraterrestrial biological entity...

described, the rate of gestation
would've been less than a day.

Maybe that's why it's there.
It wants heat. It needs heat.

329
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,837
This thing gestated abnormally fast.
What if heat activates it?

330
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:30,397
It could spur on the virus
and the rapid development of the entity.

331
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:33,911
-But it's still seeking heat. Why?
-What if it's still developing?

332
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:40,083
You're not under the impression
what we're looking for makes
sense in any conventional way?

333

No.

00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,954
You're gonna be fine, Gibson.
You're gonna be okay.

- You're gonna run more tests.
- We're gonna get you well.

337
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:08,844
You say that, but you're gonna run
more tests,just like the other doctors.

338
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,143
We have to run
some more tests, Gibson.

339

You want to make me well,

340
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:17,047
but you're just thinking about yourself
and what you can learn from me.

341
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:30,964
You're a very special boy, Gibson.
You know that yourself.

342

- It's hot in here.
- We're right above the core reactor.

This is part of the heat transfer

349

There's something in there.

- Mulder, I found something
you're not gonna believe.

353
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:37,886
- Ditto.
- We did blood tests on Gibson,

354
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,584
and there's evidence
of the virus in his system.

355
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:43,218
The same virus
you were exposed to?

356
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,888
- I'm almost positive.
- What does that mean?

357
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,195
I don't know, but I think
we're onto something.

358
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:52,134
We're onto something huge.
A link.

359
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:54,704
- I'll call that bet and raise you.
- What?

360
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:56,774
Never mind.
Just take care of Gibson.

361
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:57,706
Never mind.
Just take care of Gibson.

There was a little boy
in that room, and he's gone.

Does anybody know what happened
to that little boy?

00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:34,474
His name is Gibson Praise.
He was just in that room.

You can kill a man,

but you can't kill

Everything we were told,

00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:01,392
They can't take away the X-Files,
Scully. They tried.

419
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:07,370
You know,
Agent Fowley's report to O.P.R.
painted the facts in an interesting way.

420
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:10,134
I hope you haven't
been betrayed.

421
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:12,971
Agent Fowley's report
was a means to an end.

422
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:16,570
Trying to protect the work.
Protect the X-Files.

423
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:19,912
Mulder, Agent Fowley's report
states that the man you saw attacked...

424
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,714
was bludgeoned
by an unknown subject.

425
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,551
She makes no mention of
a little boy who, as it happens,
is nowhere to be found.

426
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:29,854
It would seem that her report
protects everything but you.

427
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:34,626
Agent Fowley took me to that plant
at great risk to herself,

428
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:38,862
where I saw something that you refuse
to believe in-- saw it again, Scully.

429
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:42,337
And though it may not say it
in her report, Diana saw it too.

430
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,931
And no matter what you think, she's
certainly not gonna go around saying...

431
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:47,534
that just because science
can't prove it, it isn't true.

432
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:52,372
I don't doubt what you saw,
Mulder.

433
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,645
I don't doubt you.

434
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:57,448
I'm willing to believe,
but not in a lie,

435
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,955
and not in the opposite
of what I can prove.

436
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:07,056
It comes down
to a matter of trust.

437
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:13,802
I guess it always has.

438
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,234
You're asking me
to make a choice?

439
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,711
I'm asking you
to trust my judgment.

440
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,817
To trust me.

441
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:35,920
I can't accept that, not if it
refutes what I know to be true.

442
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,757
Mulder,
these are test results,

443
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,457
D.N.A. from the claw nail
we found,

444
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:46,231
matching exactly the D.N.A. from the
virus you believe is extraterrestrial.

445
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:51,003
That's the connection.

446
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:55,671
Which matches exactly D.N.A.
that was found in Gibson Praise.

447
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:02,476
I don't understand. You're saying Gibson
Praise is infected with the virus?

448
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,852
No. It's a part
of his D.N.A.

449
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:07,981
In fact, it's a part
of all of our D.N.A.

450
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,356
It's called
a genetic remnant.

451
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:14,591
It's inactive junk D.N.A.,
except in Gibson, it's turned on.

452
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:21,764
If that were true, that would mean that
Gibson is in some part extraterrestrial.

453
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,769
It would mean
that all of us are.
