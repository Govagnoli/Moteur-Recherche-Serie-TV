to get a room, which is all fine,

The conspicuous absence
of any contusions or lacerations...

72
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:43,147
would strongly suggest
that the victim's injuries were
sustained without a struggle.

73
00:06:43,216 --> 00:06:46,549
From my observations,
I would have to concur with
the county coroner's report...

74
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:49,645
that her murder was most probably
a sudden and violent act...

75
00:06:49,723 --> 00:06:52,089

76
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:55,286

in my postmortem examination...

- Beyond what ?

The cervical vertebrae was fractured
in what appears to be manual trauma.

Were Skinner's the only prints
lifted from the body ?

They found no semen samples.

is the least of his sins.

such a private person ?

He lives under this misguided notion
that silence is strength.

167

He's built a wall
to keep everyone out.

- Including you ?
- Yeah, especially me.

169

Is that why
you were separated ?

170

Yeah, I just realized one day
that we were no longer married.

171

We'd become roommates instead.

I could tell he respected you.

I'm Special Agent Bonnecaze.

187
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:52,861
I've been called up from the Norfolk
field office to coordinate this inquiry.

188
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:55,464
I don't know what you do down
in Norfolk, but last time I checked,

189
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,738
riffing through a man's office
was considered an invasion of privacy.

190
00:14:58,811 --> 00:15:03,612
Well, we're operating under
guidelines specified by the

He hasn't even
been charged yet.

196
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:21,261
The hearing is to assess
and determine...

his ability to continue
in his position as Assistant Director.

198

In the meantime, we’ll be
appointing our own investigators
to pursue any criminal case.

looking into this any further.

that might support his innocence ?

obtained, Agent Mulder,

[ Line Ringing ]

204
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,500
Skinner's not answering
his phone.

205
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:03,031
- He's doing everything
he shouldn't be doing.
- Yeah, why ? He knows better.

206
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:06,340
The evidence is still
circumstantial at best.

207
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:09,006
He's behaving like
a guilty man, Mulder.

208
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:12,312
The man's marriage is breaking up.
He's stressed out.

209
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:15,387
It's his irrational behavior
that concerns me.

210
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:17,979
It speaks to his state of mind.

211
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,321
If an otherwise stable man is compelled
to go out and hire a prostitute,

212

- what else is he capable of?
- Please.

Give him the benefit
of the doubt.

214
00:16:26,065 --> 00:16:29,000
I am, Mulder, believe me.
I'm not trying to convince myself.

215
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:32,504
When I mentioned that hooker to him,
he didn't even seem to know.

216
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,974
Well, maybe he doesn't remember.

217
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:38,135
What do you mean ?
Either he remembers, or he's a liar.

218
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,235
Not necessarily.

219
00:16:43,015 --> 00:16:45,813
- This man’s running away from a train.
- [ Screaming ]

220
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:49,285
He sees it coming straight at him.
He hears its whistle.

221
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:54,054
Several times a month,
he ran away from that train...

222
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:58,688
until one night when he broke his wife's
arm when he threw her to the foor.

223
00:16:58,764 --> 00:17:00,789
- Night terrors ?
- No.

224
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:05,200
Night terrors and sleepwalking occur
during slow-wave non-dream sleep.

225
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:08,502
The clinical term for this is
" REM sleep behavior disorder."

226
00:17:08,574 --> 00:17:12,567
Although rare, dozens of cases
of sleep-related violence
have been attributed to it.

227
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:15,546
That's fascinating, but what does it
have to do with Skinner ?

228
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:18,947
This videotape came from
the Bethesda Sleep Disorder Center...

229
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:22,020
where Skinner has been receiving
treatment for the past three months.

230
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:27,252
- From running away from trains ?
- Same disorder, different dreams.

231
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:30,193
According to
Skinner's psychiatrist,

232
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:34,961
he's been experiencing a recurring
dream in which he's confronted
by an old woman.

233
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:37,002
She speaks to him,
but he doesn't understand a word.

234
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:40,903
Sometimes she straddles
his chest, suffocating him.

235
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:44,465
So you think that Skinner may have
killed the victim in his sleep ?

236
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:47,637
Defending himself against
this imaginary old woman.

237
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:51,672
A lot of these patients
have no recollection
of their nocturnal activities,

238
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:53,685
which might explain
Skinner's amnesia.

239
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,979
- That's not such a strange story.
- It isn't ?

240
00:17:57,089 --> 00:18:00,286
It's ancient, actually.
You may have heard it,

241
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:03,453
although not in such
clinical terms.

242
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:06,396
In the Middle Ages, a visitation
like the one Skinner described...

243
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:10,094
would have been attributed
to succubus.

244
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:14,105
It's a spirit
that visits men in the night,
usually in the form of an old woman.

245
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:16,334
- Visits them for sex ?
- Usually.

246
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:18,809
Although sometimes the succubus
becomes so attached to the man...

247
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:22,439
that she would kill any woman
competing for his affection.

248
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:24,311
Here.

249
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:31,746
- What's that ?
- Reports of residual
and luminous phenomenon...

250
00:18:31,857 --> 00:18:34,189
have been associated
with some succubus encounters.

251
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,490
At least according
to the mythology. Why ?

252
00:18:36,562 --> 00:18:38,792
I feel kinda strange saying
this, but I found something...

253
00:18:38,864 --> 00:18:42,265
during my postmortem examination
that I think you should see.

254
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:47,805
It's a circular patch
around the victim's mouth and nose,

255
00:18:47,873 --> 00:18:50,842
approximately 11 centimeters
in diameter.

256
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:55,108
It retained light energy.
It glowed in the dark.

257
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:09,726
I know what I saw, Mulder.
It was here.

258
00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:12,787
This phosphorescence required
no U.V. or infrared light ?

259
00:19:12,865 --> 00:19:17,325
- No, it was definitely
visible to the naked eye.
- Did you get a sample ?

260
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:20,600
- Yeah, I sent one over to Chem/Tox.
- And ?

261
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:23,938
Well, my first hunch was that it was
that it was some kind of fungal growth,

262
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:25,811
but the only substance
that they detected was amylase,
which is found in saliva.

263
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:27,779
but the only substance
that they detected was amylase,
which is found in saliva.

264
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,840
So I had them send over a sample
to the elemental analysis unit.

265
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:35,614
The results should be back.

266
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:39,146

results on a tissue sample...

earlier this morning.

- Thank you.
- What'd they say ?

269
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,235
That there was no analyzable substance
in the sample container.

270
00:19:50,302 --> 00:19:52,099
Are you sure
you saw something ?

271
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:55,698
Mulder, I'm afraid this isn't exactly
something that I'd make up.

272
00:19:58,477 --> 00:20:01,537
Maybe that's it.

273
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:05,583
Maybe that's why Skinner's running.
He's afraid.

332
00:25:46,124 --> 00:25:50,527

334
00:26:00,806 --> 00:26:05,743
I told you once what--
what happened to me in Vietnam.

335
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:07,870
I was caught in an ambush.

336

Yeah, you were
the sole survivor.

337
00:26:10,482 --> 00:26:14,009
You also described what sounded
like a near-death experience.

338
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:19,114
There was nothing near about it,
Agent Mulder. I was a dead man.

339

That's when
you first saw her ?

340
00:26:21,693 --> 00:26:25,151
I saw lots of things over there.

to any of'em.
- Why not ?

[ Sighs ]

343
00:26:32,471 --> 00:26:37,431
I got through that experience

with whatever was around.

00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,884
So you just dismissed her
as another hallucination ?

00:26:47,953 --> 00:26:51,116
- I tried.
- But you couldn't.

348
00:26:52,858 --> 00:26:55,793
She was there with me,

watching me,

350
00:26:58,163 --> 00:27:03,226
as I was watching myself die
and my blood spilling from
a hundred different places...

According to Walter's report,
the hood was still warm when
they got to Skinner's apartment,

of Sharon Skinner's car.

going over the interior ?

on the steering wheel were Skinner's.

- Can I borrow your flashlight ?
- Sure. Why ?

I don't know what you’re
expecting to find, Mulder,

but Skinner's hearing is
in half an hour.

369
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:22,872
- I'll meet you there.
- What are you doing ?

Collecting evidence.

- You know how an air bag works ?
- Your car hits something,
a bag fills with air, you don't die.

372
00:28:32,157 --> 00:28:34,455
Not air.
Nitrogen.

373
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:36,460
Now, the latent image,
the one we're interested in,

374
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:38,860
is found in the byproduct
of that explosion...

375
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:42,889
in the finely dispersed sodium metal
that coats the interior of the air bag.

376
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:45,596
See this pattern here ?
It was created...

377
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,968
by whoever was behind the wheel
when the airbag deployed.

378
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,032
- It doesn't look like a face.
- Not yet.

379
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:54,272
First, I'm scanning the pattern,
then I'm running it through software...

380
00:28:54,346 --> 00:28:58,874
which translates its varying densities
into a dimensionalized likeness.

381
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,408
After that,
it's a matter of fine-tuning.

- How long does that take ?
- You need this in a hurry,

You say you found nothing damning.

No, sir, none of the physical evidence
we recovered directly...

to her death.

You reexamined the victim's body.

Did you find anything of note ?

of an extraneous substance
that turned out to be unidentifiable.

- And do you have any idea
why it was there ?
- No.

If you are withholding something
from this committee--

or to speak for Agent Mulder.

To say what ?

397
00:30:16,094 --> 00:30:21,191
Agent Mulder had a theory
that the substance could have
come from a visitation.

398
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:24,861
But you have
another explanation.

I have encountered,

I have always viewed
through the lens of science.

403
00:30:36,481 --> 00:30:39,746
I believe that is why I was assigned
to the X-Files and to Agent Mulder.

404
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:46,086
And has A.D. Skinner always been
as discriminating as you ?

They used the X-Files.

- Because I think Skinner's
been outmaneuvered, Scully.

[ Sighs ]

491
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,568
That what really got me
through each day was...

492
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:15,544
knowing that I'd be sleeping
next to you that night,

493
00:37:15,613 --> 00:37:19,549
knowing that I had a reason
to wake up in the morning.

494
00:37:32,063 --> 00:37:34,998
I'm not sure
if you can even hear me now...

495
00:37:37,602 --> 00:37:40,571
or if it even makes
a difference to you anymore,

496
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,570
but I at least wanted you
to know that.

Somebody--

500
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,868
Listen to me.

501
00:39:20,004 --> 00:39:23,167
- [ Ringing ]
- Did you get him ?

502
00:39:23,241 --> 00:39:25,300
No, he hasn't shown up yet.

503
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:29,437
- He should have been here
1 5 minutes ago.
- What's going on ?

504
00:39:29,514 --> 00:39:31,846
Nothing.
[ Sighs ]

505
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:35,113
- Great.
- Maybe it's the rain.

506
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:38,279
This guy isn't about to let
a little rain stop him.

- Mulder, hang on a second.

-Judy !
- Scully, what's going on ?

509
00:39:45,396 --> 00:39:48,297
Mulder, get up here right now.

510
00:39:48,366 --> 00:39:50,300
He's upstairs.

511
00:39:54,038 --> 00:39:56,632
Judy ?

[ Gasping ]
What the hell are you doing ?

514
00:40:19,597 --> 00:40:22,327
I'm sorry. I called,
but you didn't answer.

515
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:27,328
What's the matter ?

- You okay ?
- [ Groans ]

519
00:41:27,365 --> 00:41:30,266
- Sir ?
- Come in.

520
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:32,268
This is our report.
[ Sighs ]

521
00:41:32,336 --> 00:41:36,204
You'll see, though, that
several questions remain unanswered.

522
00:41:36,274 --> 00:41:38,208
The identity
of the man I shot ?

523
00:41:38,276 --> 00:41:41,609
We ran his face and fingerprints
through every available database.

524
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:44,978
There's still no matches,
and we're doing a dental record search,

525
00:41:45,049 --> 00:41:48,712
but that'll probably be
a dead end too.

526
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:53,257
And regarding the other man,
the telephone number we had
for him has been disconnected,

527
00:41:53,357 --> 00:41:56,087
and there's no record
of an account.

528
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,187
Don't waste your time, Agent Scully.
You won't find him.

529
00:42:00,264 --> 00:42:04,132
just get whatever forensic evidence you
need off the body you have and bury it.

530
00:42:09,607 --> 00:42:11,666
- Is there a problem, Agent Mulder ?
- Yeah,

531
00:42:11,742 --> 00:42:14,142
there's something else
you'll find missing in there.

532
00:42:14,212 --> 00:42:18,342
An explanation for how you knew
to beat the hotel last night.

533
00:42:20,551 --> 00:42:23,247
I was hoping you could fill in
that line item yourself.

534
00:42:25,857 --> 00:42:28,724
I'm afraid I can't do that,
at least not at this point in time.

535
00:42:28,793 --> 00:42:31,694
Why not ?

536
00:42:31,762 --> 00:42:35,892
Because whatever I believed
may have happened,

537
00:42:35,967 --> 00:42:38,094
that has no place
on an official report.

538
00:42:38,169 --> 00:42:41,605
Then why don’t you
just tell me.

539
00:42:41,672 --> 00:42:43,606
Off the record.

540
00:42:53,918 --> 00:42:56,546
If you’ll excuse me,
I have some catching up to do.

541
00:42:56,654 --> 00:42:59,088
The O.P.C. did a number
on my office.

542
00:43:01,893 --> 00:43:04,259
But I wanna thank you for
the quick turnaround on this.
