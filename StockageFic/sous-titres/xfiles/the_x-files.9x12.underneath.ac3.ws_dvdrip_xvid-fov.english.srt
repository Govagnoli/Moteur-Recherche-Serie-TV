361
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,266
The DNA is similar to Fassl's...

362
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:08,633
to a degree we haven't quite
made sense of yet.

363
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,069
Look...

364
00:24:10,173 --> 00:24:11,367
I just spoke to the DA.

365
00:24:11,474 --> 00:24:13,169
He's authorized
a settlement offer...

366
00:24:13,276 --> 00:24:15,744
which I intend to deliver
to Mr. Fassl's counsel...

367
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:18,780
posthaste.

368
00:24:18,881 --> 00:24:21,008
I'll send the bailiffs down
to retrieve the case files.

369
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:23,650
Have a nice flight back to D.C.

370
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,778

This isn't about the truth.

This is about getting a conviction,
Agent Doggett.

373
00:24:32,195 --> 00:24:34,095
And if we can't
get a conviction...

374
00:24:34,197 --> 00:24:36,995
then the truth doesn't matter.

375
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,494
John...

376
00:24:41,604 --> 00:24:43,834
I may have a break in this case.

377
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,498
A suspect.

378
00:24:45,608 --> 00:24:47,098
A suspect?

379
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,336
Not Fassl?

380

So, who is he?

382
00:24:53,349 --> 00:24:54,441

I'm wondering...

383
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,177
more along the line
of what is he?

384
00:24:56,285 --> 00:24:58,845
I ran him through
the known offender database...

385
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,321
facial recognition...
came up with nothing.

386
00:25:01,424 --> 00:25:03,187
It's like he has no identity.

387
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:04,987
Yet somehow...

388
00:25:05,094 --> 00:25:08,621
this person materialized
inside a maximum security prison...

389
00:25:08,731 --> 00:25:11,757
killed an inmate
and then vanished into thin air.

390
00:25:11,868 --> 00:25:15,463
Materialized how,
like Casper, the Friendly Ghost?

391
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:17,795
When Duke and I...

392
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:18,999
entered that house back in '89...

393
00:25:19,108 --> 00:25:21,133
we didn't find ZZ Top here.

394
00:25:21,244 --> 00:25:22,472
We found Bob Fassl.

395
00:25:22,578 --> 00:25:24,944
End of story.

396
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:27,277
Yeah, but what if the two
were somehow connected?

397
00:25:27,383 --> 00:25:29,749
Monica, for God's sake,
this is not an X-File.

398
00:25:29,852 --> 00:25:31,444
Don't try to turn it into one.

399
00:25:31,554 --> 00:25:33,021
In prison, this being,
this person...

400
00:25:33,122 --> 00:25:34,680
whatever you want to call him...

401
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,384
- he acted as if he were
protecting Bob Fassl.
- Protecting him?

402
00:25:37,493 --> 00:25:40,485
How, by getting him locked up
in prison in the first place?

403
00:25:40,596 --> 00:25:42,496
So, either he's
doing Fassl's bidding...

404
00:25:42,598 --> 00:25:43,997
or Fassl's doing his.

405

406

was the one who
committed the other seven murders.

407
00:25:51,807 --> 00:25:53,900
I think we can prove it.

408
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,500
DNA evidence
in the Sing Sing murder...

409
00:25:55,611 --> 00:25:58,045
was gathered and filed
by the prison authorities.

410
00:25:58,147 --> 00:26:00,638

is compare it to the DNA...

Unfortunately,
that's not going to work.

414
00:26:06,122 --> 00:26:09,353

00:33:27,262 --> 00:33:29,924
that he couldn't even admit it
to himself?

538
00:33:30,032 --> 00:33:33,832
Might not someone like that
manifest a second personality?

539
00:33:33,936 --> 00:33:35,904
But it wouldn't
explain the DNA evidence.

540
00:33:36,004 --> 00:33:37,733
It would...

541
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,276
if he physically <i>became</i>
that other personality.

542
00:33:41,377 --> 00:33:44,369
So, what, we've moved on
from Casper, the Friendly Ghost...

543
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,947
to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?

544
00:33:46,048 --> 00:33:48,414
There is a precedent...

545
00:33:48,517 --> 00:33:50,610
in the Catholic Canon itself.

546
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:52,118
Transubstantiation:

547
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:54,280

of matter and energy.

548
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,857

Monica, I've slept through
my share of Sunday schools...

551
00:34:01,163 --> 00:34:02,391
but I never heard the story...

552
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,125
about the guy
becoming another guy.

553
00:34:04,233 --> 00:34:06,497
It's the one explanation
that makes sense.

554
00:34:06,602 --> 00:34:08,797

what happened 13 years ago...

555
00:34:08,904 --> 00:34:10,929
and it explains
what's happening now.

556
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:12,836
So what you're saying is...

557
00:34:12,941 --> 00:34:17,071
because this man won't face himself,
won't face his own sins...

558
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:19,943
then he is forced
to become someone else.

559
00:34:21,417 --> 00:34:23,146
A killer.

560
00:34:23,252 --> 00:34:26,779
So, how does someone go about
catching a killer...

561
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:29,323

inside an innocent man?

562
00:34:47,209 --> 00:34:48,733
