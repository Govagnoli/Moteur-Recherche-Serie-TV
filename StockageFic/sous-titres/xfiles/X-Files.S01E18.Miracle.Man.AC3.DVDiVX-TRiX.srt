1
00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:05,916
(power saw whirring)

2
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:14,293
Hurry and get him out of there!

3
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:18,190
I need two men
on the left side now.

4
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:22,200
Wait. Where you
goin' with him?

5
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:23,429
He's dead.

6
00:00:23,503 --> 00:00:24,561
There's a woman
over there who isn't

7
00:00:24,638 --> 00:00:26,538
and she needs some oxygen.

8
00:00:40,754 --> 00:00:43,314
Boy: I want you to rise!

9
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,221
Rise up and heal!

10
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:46,623
What the hell you doing?

11
00:00:46,693 --> 00:00:48,126
Boy's laying on hands.

12
00:00:48,195 --> 00:00:49,287
Rise up

13
00:00:49,363 --> 00:00:50,660
and accept the miracle

14
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:52,892
He's given you.

15
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:54,831
You don't understand.
The man's dead.

16
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:59,099
Then the boy can't possibly
do any harm, can he?

17
00:00:59,172 --> 00:01:00,264
For this

18
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,967
is the power of belief--

19
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:05,442
the power to separate
the light from the darkness

20
00:01:05,512 --> 00:01:07,810
to create life from death.

21
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:09,280
Amen.

22
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:11,749
Show's over!

23
00:01:11,818 --> 00:01:13,911
Let's clear the area.

24
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:32,067
Hallelujah, Samuel.
Hallelujah.

25
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:23,620
(singing gospel)

26
00:02:30,764 --> 00:02:32,994
Yes, indeed, praise God!

27
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:36,399
Yes! Yes! Yes!

28
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,768
I want everybody
to say hallelujah!

29
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:39,771
(congregation:)
Hallelujah!

30
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,967
Praise the Lord!

31
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:46,809
The woman on the table has
a malignant tumor on her spine.

32
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:48,471
This boy here will attempt

33
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:50,880
to heal her by simply
laying his hands on her.

34
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:52,316
Where did you get this?

35
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:54,717
From the regional office
in Tennessee.

36
00:02:54,788 --> 00:02:56,415
The preacher's name is...

37
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,889
Reverend Calvin Hartley.

38
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,516
You've heard ofhim.

39
00:02:59,593 --> 00:03:01,493
The boy is his adopted son, Samuel.

40
00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:03,756
He claims to have found him
as an infant

41
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,697
Iying in the tall weeds
near the muddy Mississippi.

42
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:09,894
He also claims the boy brought
a man back from the dead.

43
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,369
It's more than a claim.

44
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:14,373
The man he saved appears
as a regular attraction

45
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:16,409
in the reverend's tent ministry.

46
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,501
The boy's been
performing miracles

47
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:20,807
every week for the past ten years,
twice on Sunday.

48
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:23,576
Not according to the Kenwood sheriff.

49
00:03:23,683 --> 00:03:24,877
Local authorities think

50
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:28,284
Reverend Hartley and his son
are a scam.

51
00:03:28,355 --> 00:03:30,118
They've been trying
to shut them down

52
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,680
but without any luck.

53
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:33,749
They've turned to the FBI
to try and get a prosecution.

54
00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:35,351
Forwhat? Fraud?

55
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:36,895
No. Murder.

56
00:03:36,963 --> 00:03:39,090
Watch the tape.

57
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:42,032
Lucy Kelly has the cancer.

58
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:45,663
Her doctors say it is inoperable.

59
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,606
They say it is incurable.

60
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:50,267
But I say to you

61
00:03:50,377 --> 00:03:53,835
that what the doctors cannot cure

62
00:03:53,947 --> 00:03:55,175
the Lord can.

63
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:56,579
(congregation:)
Amen!

64
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,174
Yes, indeed. Praise God.

65
00:03:58,285 --> 00:04:00,185
Because God...

66
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:03,120
can work... miracles.

67
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:04,918
- Yes, Lord.
- Praise God.

68
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:09,428
The clear light
of God's healing love...

69
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:10,929
is fowing...

70
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:15,991
through Samuel's healing hands...

71
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:19,004
20 minutes later, Lucy Kelly
was rushed to the hospital.

72
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:20,596
She was pronounced dead on arrival.

73
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:22,039
What caused her death?

74
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:24,906
I don't know,
but it wasn't cancer.

75
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:26,945
They've requested someone

76
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:29,880
with a medical background
to assist local police.

77
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,508
I know it's not an X file...

78
00:04:31,618 --> 00:04:33,552
When do we leave for Tennessee?

79
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:46,865
I think I saw some of
these same people at Woodstock.

80
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:49,367
Mulder, you weren't at Woodstock.

81
00:04:49,436 --> 00:04:51,404
I saw the movie.

82
00:04:58,511 --> 00:05:01,241
You all right by yourself?

83
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:02,645
I'll be fine.

84
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:04,183
I won't be long.

85
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:05,546
Okay.

86
00:05:08,388 --> 00:05:12,620
(sighing)

87
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:16,253
Hartley: Most of you here today
I know as neighbors

88
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:19,594
and as cherished members
ofour Miracle Ministry.

89
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:23,295
But some ofyou have come
from far away...

90
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,667
as far away

91
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:25,864
as Pensacola, Florida...

92
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:27,463
(cheering)

93
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,804
and Uniondale, Long lsland!

94
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:31,968
Wayne Ashtown and his family.

95
00:05:32,078 --> 00:05:35,047
And it is especially
to those ofyou

96
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:36,911
who come from so far

97
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:41,283
that I must apologize
from the bottom ofmy heart...

98
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:43,117
because, unfortunately

99
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:46,181
Samuel cannot be here
this afternoon.

100
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,591
I know how very
deeply disappointed

101
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:52,098
each and every one of you
must be feeling right now

102
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:55,157
but I say unto you,
do not be dismayed.

103
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:56,532
Do not despair!

104
00:05:56,603 --> 00:05:58,503
Do not lose your hope...

105
00:05:58,571 --> 00:06:02,632
because in two short days,
Samuel will be back here

106
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:05,542
at our very special
miracle mission!

107
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:10,742
Yes, indeed, praise God.

108
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,784
Maybe we should head backstage

109
00:06:12,852 --> 00:06:15,082
and see what the reverend
has to say.

110
00:06:15,155 --> 00:06:17,919
Wait. This is where
they bring out Elvis.

111
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:19,856
As these people will testify

112
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:22,156
Samuel can heal you.

113
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:25,254
Yes, Samuel will heal you.

114
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:26,958
But...

115
00:06:28,702 --> 00:06:30,966
only if you believe.

116
00:06:33,473 --> 00:06:34,701
God bless you!

117
00:06:34,774 --> 00:06:37,572
Scully: Reverend Hartley,
we're with the FBl.

118
00:06:37,677 --> 00:06:40,441
I see Sheriff Daniels
has sent in the cavalry.

119
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:42,481
We just want to talk to Samuel

120
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:43,982
for a couple of minutes.

121
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,278
He's not here.

122
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:47,114
Mulder: Well, where is he?

123
00:06:47,187 --> 00:06:48,484
I don't know.

124
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:50,250
I haven't seen him.

125
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:52,689
That boy's been
a bit troubled lately.

126
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,454
We're running late, Reverend.

127
00:06:54,527 --> 00:06:56,961
If you'll excuse me.

128
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:18,645
Agent Mulder?

129
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:19,707
Yeah.

130
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:20,877
Sheriff Daniels.

131
00:07:20,954 --> 00:07:22,387
We spoke on the phone.

132
00:07:22,455 --> 00:07:24,548
This is Special Agent Dana Scully.

133
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:27,388
You requested a copy
of the coroner's report.

134
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,757
Right. Thankyou.

135
00:07:28,828 --> 00:07:30,227
I see you got a chance

136
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:32,560
to take in
the Holy Roller sideshow.

137
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:34,930
Something tells me
you're not a member

138
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:36,559
of the reverend's fock.

139
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:38,035
I remember Hartley

140
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:39,766
when he was a soapbox preacher

141
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:42,171
collecting dollar bills
in coffee cans.

142
00:07:42,242 --> 00:07:43,800
Since the boyjoined the act

143
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:47,175
he's gotten himselfa Cadillac
for every day of the week

144
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,645
bought forwith money

145
00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:51,650
that should be used to improve
our roads and schools.

146
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:53,151
People want to believe.

147
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:55,949
99% of the people
in this world are fools

148
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:59,549
and the rest ofus are
in great danger of contagion.

149
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:01,719
Even if Hartley and Samuel are fakes

150
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:03,126
it's still a long way

151
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:04,959
from accusing the boy of murder.

152
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:06,794
Witnesses say the boy was there

153
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:09,664
laying hands on those people
when they died.

154
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:12,830
You think that's how
he killed them, with a touch?

155
00:08:12,906 --> 00:08:14,339
I don't know how

156
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:16,500
but we've been looking
for him since Tuesday

157
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:18,839
and he does not want
to be found.

158
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:21,345
There's nothing unusual
about these reports

159
00:08:21,414 --> 00:08:23,712
except that there were
no autopsies.

160
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:25,774
Hartley blocked
my autopsy request

161
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:27,182
on religious grounds.

162
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:29,517
It doesn't help
that the county coroner

163
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:31,454
is a member
of the Miracle Ministry.

164
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:32,957
Maybe we can arrange

165
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:35,153
to have them exhumed.

166
00:08:36,196 --> 00:08:38,164
to have them exhumed.

167
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,205
Sheriff...

168
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:02,912
It's Reverend Hartley's group.

169
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:04,387
Damn.

170
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:08,154
I told my people to keep quiet
so this wouldn't happen.

171
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:10,992
Looks like you might have
a few believers

172
00:09:11,064 --> 00:09:12,326
on the payroll.

173
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:15,492
Man: On behalf
of the Miracle Ministry

174
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:19,129
we demand that you stop
this sacrilege.

175
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:22,072
You're not just dealing
with me anymore, Vance.

176
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:24,336
You're dealing with the FBl.

177
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,244
We don't mean you any disrespect.

178
00:09:28,314 --> 00:09:30,748
We're investigating
a possible homicide.

179
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:34,776
Federal law requires we do a postmortem
examination on these bodies.

180
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:37,550
I'm afraid we answer
to a higher authority

181
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:41,423
than the U.S. government--
one that considers grave digging

182
00:09:41,494 --> 00:09:43,724
and defiling corpses
mortal sins.

183
00:09:43,796 --> 00:09:46,162
Daniels: We'll get
that autopsy, Vance.

184
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:48,496
Sooner or later,
you know we will.

185
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:49,933
The deceased's family

186
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:52,403
does not want
her grave disturbed.

187
00:09:52,472 --> 00:09:55,066
Carol Wallace had no family.

188
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:57,268
We were her family.

189
00:09:59,145 --> 00:10:01,670
We were her family

190
00:10:01,748 --> 00:10:04,774
and it was hard enough
to bury her once.

191
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:08,446
So if you insist
on going through with this

192
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:10,522
we're prepared
to maintain a vigil

193
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:14,525
and do whatever it takes
to stop you.

194
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:16,289
Daniels: Mulder

195
00:10:16,362 --> 00:10:17,954
Scully...

196
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:21,128
What?

197
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,466
One of my men just spotted
the boy's car downtown.

198
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:27,403
Can't do much here.

199
00:10:27,473 --> 00:10:28,531
Mulder: Let's go.

200
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:50,762
Daniels: Not a very likely place
to be saving souls.

201
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:07,246
Where's the boy, Zook?

202
00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:08,871
He's in the can.

203
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:10,381
What happened here?

204
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,350
Damn fool started a fight.

205
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:14,318
Figures them Bible thumpers

206
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:18,551
wouldn't know how to hold their liquor.

207
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:19,784
Where you been, Samuel?

208
00:11:19,892 --> 00:11:21,655
We've been looking for you.

209
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:22,786
Yeah?

210
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:24,362
I've been thinking.

211
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,194
Well, you're going
to have plenty of time

212
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:28,665
for that now, son.

213
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:30,930
I'm putting you under arrest.

214
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:33,666
For murder?

215
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,264
For suspicion ofmurder.

216
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:39,107
You mind if I finish my beer first?

217
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:41,169
Well, you go right on ahead.

218
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:44,580
I'm going to have somebody
take a statement from you.

219
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,641
I'll see what I can do

220
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:49,085
about getting your Caddie towed.

221
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:50,348
Hey, Sheriff.

222
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:51,980
What evidence do you have

223
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:53,888
to charge the boy with murder?

224
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,518
Well, what more do you want?

225
00:11:55,628 --> 00:11:58,529
The boy's practically
given himself up.

226
00:11:58,598 --> 00:11:59,997
He's drunk, though.

227
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:02,830
Well, then I'll add
drunk and disorderly.

228
00:12:02,902 --> 00:12:04,460
Let's get this straight.

229
00:12:04,537 --> 00:12:07,301
It's not a question
about the boy's guilt

230
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:09,273
just how he did it.

231
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:11,640
Let me have a minute with him?

232
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:13,576
Suit yourself.

233
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:16,012
Samuel, I'm Agent Mulder.

234
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:18,141
This is Agent Scully.

235
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:20,014
We're from the FBl.

236
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:22,987
Looks like you took
quite a beating there.

237
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:25,421
Penance, Mr. Mulder.

238
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:28,255
Some might call it
a plain old bar brawl.

239
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:30,420
You know what they say--

240
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,158
" He giveth and He taketh away."

241
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:36,625
Man gets too proud

242
00:12:36,702 --> 00:12:38,897
sometimes it does him good

243
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:41,906
to get the crap
kicked out of him.

244
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:43,874
Saves God the trouble.

245
00:12:43,943 --> 00:12:44,967
The trouble of what?

246
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:47,444
Humbling the guilty sinner.

247
00:12:47,513 --> 00:12:49,174
Guilty of murder?

248
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,545
Yes, sir.

249
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:55,553
How did you do it, Samuel?

250
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:58,215
Apparently,
my pride and my weakness

251
00:12:58,324 --> 00:13:00,656
were an invitation to the devil.

252
00:13:00,726 --> 00:13:03,661
I muddied the river
of my own faith.

253
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:05,526
Now my gift has been corrupted.

254
00:13:05,598 --> 00:13:09,034
You're saying that you killed
those people with a touch?

255
00:13:09,102 --> 00:13:12,799
I've laid my hands on the ill,
given them health.

256
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:14,464
I've healed the sick.

257
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:19,273
I've even touched the dying
and given them life.

258
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:22,337
God has given me a special gift.

259
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:24,747
Did He buy you
all that jewelry too?

260
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:27,183
Something is missing
in your story.

261
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:29,517
Do you doubt
the power of God, ma'am?

262
00:13:29,622 --> 00:13:33,991
No, but I doubt
the veracity of your claims.

263
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,689
I have looked on the infirm
and seen their sickness--

264
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:39,355
their cancer.

265
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,326
just as I can see the pain

266
00:13:44,403 --> 00:13:46,303
on this man right here.

267
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:47,430
Really?

268
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:49,168
What pain is that?

269
00:13:52,745 --> 00:13:55,305
The pain you have...

270
00:13:55,381 --> 00:13:57,508
regarding a brother

271
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,414
or a sister.

272
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:01,612
It's an old pain.

273
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:04,451
It's never been healed.

274
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:05,990
Is this some kind

275
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:07,821
of a trick?

276
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,988
No trick, ma'am.

277
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:12,553
Let's get the sheriff...

278
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:16,294
I want to hear more about this pain.
Tell me.

279
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:19,463
I can see it, plain as day.

280
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:20,972
It was a sister.

281
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,440
You lost a sister quiteyoung.

282
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:25,807
Someone took her away.

283
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:27,971
What else do you see?

284
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:29,605
Strangers...

285
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:31,149
a bright light.

286
00:14:31,217 --> 00:14:32,377
Sheriff...

287
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:34,749
Samuel: You should have
come here earlier.

288
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,447
I could have healed your pain.

289
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:37,887
Let's get this overwith.

290
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,048
I need another minute.

291
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:41,922
I can't help you, not anymore.

292
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:43,427
My gift is gone.

293
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:45,487
Cuff him.

294
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:55,300
Let's go.

295
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:57,342
You have the right
to remain silent.

296
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,345
I'll tell you, Mr. Mulder--

297
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:02,506
God watches over his fock.

298
00:15:02,582 --> 00:15:04,982
He gives us signs every day.

299
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:08,020
Open your heart.

300
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:10,783
He mightjust open your eyes.

301
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:16,224
How do you think

302
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:17,557
he does it?

303
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,325
I don't know.

304
00:15:26,472 --> 00:15:28,406
Woman: Given his exemplary record

305
00:15:28,474 --> 00:15:30,999
and the highly circumstantial nature
ofthis case

306
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,305
I ask that my client be released

307
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:34,936
on his own recognizance

308
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:36,105
without bail...

309
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:38,308
judge, that is not a good idea.

310
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:39,213
Samuel!

311
00:15:39,285 --> 00:15:40,343
Let me go

312
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:41,886
and it will be on your head.

313
00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:43,148
Enough.

314
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:45,588
This is not a pulpit,
this is a court oflaw.

315
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:47,057
Is that understood?

316
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:51,797
Yes, sir.

317
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:53,092
Sorry.

318
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,225
Man: Your Honor,
despite the defendant's

319
00:15:57,303 --> 00:15:58,668
avowed guilt

320
00:15:58,738 --> 00:16:01,138
we see no reason to burden the county

321
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:03,573
with his maintenance until trial.

322
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:07,271
But we do request
a minimum bail of$1 00,000.

323
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,177
All right, ifthere
are no objections.

324
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:11,182
Bail is set at $1 00,000

325
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,549
to be deposited directly
into the clerk's

326
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,747
probation account.

327
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:18,050
My God!

328
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:19,250
What is it?

329
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:20,758
Good God!

330
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:22,123
My God!

331
00:16:22,194 --> 00:16:23,354
What is it?!

332
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:24,487
What is this?

333
00:16:24,563 --> 00:16:25,552
What...

334
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:26,825
What...

335
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:34,303
Oh, God!

336
00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:36,568
How much more

337
00:16:36,642 --> 00:16:39,042
will it take foryou to believe?

338
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:42,444
The Lord has testified against me.

339
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:44,005
Does the serpent have to biteyou

340
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:46,607
on the ass till you understand?

341
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:50,120
Everybody, clear this courtroom.

342
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:09,602
Mulder: "And when it was morning

343
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:11,939
"the east wind brought the locusts.

344
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:15,445
"And the locusts covered
the face ofthe whole earth.

345
00:17:15,514 --> 00:17:17,414
"So that the land was darkened.

346
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:19,314
And they did eat every herb..."

347
00:17:19,385 --> 00:17:20,647
Come on, Mulder...

348
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,689
"And all the fruit ofthe trees
which the hail..."

349
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:24,882
A few thousand grasshoppers

350
00:17:24,957 --> 00:17:26,754
does not constitute a plague.

351
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:28,817
Besides, we're in farm country.

352
00:17:28,894 --> 00:17:31,556
This area is an
agricultural smorgasbord

353
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,621
for this type ofinfestation.

354
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:37,396
Maybe in a cornfield,
but this happened in a courtroom.

355
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,801
So what's next?

356
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:40,463
The slaying ofthe firstborn?

357
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:42,370
(chuckles)

358
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:43,533
Does this have to do

359
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:46,167
with what Samuel said
in the bar last night

360
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:48,246
aboutyour sister?

361
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:51,950
I had these patient cases
sent over

362
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:54,076
from Kenwood County Hospital.

363
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:55,882
These are physician-documented cases

364
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:57,388
ofpatients who went to Samuel

365
00:17:57,456 --> 00:17:59,686
after conventional treatments failed.

366
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,058
"Spontaneous remission
ofmetastatic cancer...

367
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:06,428
" Regenerated nerve growth
after post-trauma paraplegia..."

368
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:10,162
I have encountered dozens
ofpsychic healers

369
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:11,669
but none like this.

370
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:13,398
I think the kid is for real.

371
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:14,769
This is intriguing

372
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,367
but there is a whole library
ofmedical literature

373
00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:21,537
dealing with unexplained
spontaneous cures.

374
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:24,207
Now Western medicine
treats the human body

375
00:18:24,316 --> 00:18:26,716
in biochemical terms.

376
00:18:26,786 --> 00:18:28,777
But the body
could also be treated

377
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:31,288
as an electromagnetic system.

378
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:33,291
Soyour theory is that ifSamuel

379
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,418
can repair this energy field to heal

380
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:37,359
he can also destroy it to kill.

381
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,488
Why not?

382
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:41,089
Okay, say that
Samuel's touch can kill.

383
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:43,032
Whywould he want to?

384
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:46,299
He said he muddied the river
ofhis own faith, meaning...

385
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:47,669
(knock at door)

386
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:55,911
Ifyou're available

387
00:18:55,981 --> 00:18:58,313
Reverend would like
to seeyou.

388
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,480
Hartley: I've been under
a lot ofstress lately

389
00:19:04,557 --> 00:19:07,754
which I know doesn't excuse
my rude behavioryesterday

390
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:11,228
but I hopeyou found it
in your hearts to forgive me.

391
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:13,288
Why did you want
to speakwith us?

392
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,459
I need your help.

393
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:18,332
Samuel is being tried for murder.

394
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:19,871
You need a good lawyer.

395
00:19:19,939 --> 00:19:21,406
Samuel is innocent.

396
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:22,964
How can you be sure?

397
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:25,943
Because he's my son.

398
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:28,707
That argument
will not work on ajury.

399
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:31,305
And Samuel's confession
won't help much either.

400
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:33,214
You have to understand--

401
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:36,015
Samuel is a very complicated
young man.

402
00:19:36,088 --> 00:19:39,285
He feels things
like no one else.

403
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:43,522
To him, a pinprick
becomes a gaping wound.

404
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:45,188
His power comes

405
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:47,289
from this ability to feel.

406
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:49,425
But some people fear that power.

407
00:19:49,502 --> 00:19:52,130
And out oftheirweakness
and their fear

408
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:53,831
they seek to destroy it.

409
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:55,567
You mean Sheriff Daniels.

410
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:59,133
It's no secret Sheriff Daniels
has been trying to shut me down

411
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:00,974
since I first opened my tent

412
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,012
ten years ago.

413
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:03,105
He seems to think

414
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:05,183
thatyour ministry
is a fraud.

415
00:20:05,284 --> 00:20:07,548
He's a faithless man,
Agent Scully.

416
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,351
His wife, she suffers
from a most painful arthritis.

417
00:20:11,423 --> 00:20:14,290
Her fingers are twisted
like bitter roots.

418
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,488
Yet he keeps Samuel
from ministering to her.

419
00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:20,361
In light ofrecent events,
you can't blame him.

420
00:20:20,432 --> 00:20:23,128
I don't know
how those poor people died.

421
00:20:23,202 --> 00:20:25,432
I can't explain that.

422
00:20:25,504 --> 00:20:28,564
Which is why I'm asking you
to be there tonight

423
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:30,404
soyou could see
foryourselves

424
00:20:30,476 --> 00:20:32,444
Samuel doing God's work.

425
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:35,847
Can I count on you both
to be there?

426
00:20:35,915 --> 00:20:38,076
I think so.
Mulder, what doyou think?

427
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,243
Excuse me.

428
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:53,791
Where did she go?

429
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:54,833
Who?

430
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,231
The little girl.

431
00:20:56,302 --> 00:20:58,566
There's no little girl around here.

432
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:10,606
Scully: Mulder...

433
00:21:17,823 --> 00:21:19,791
A little girl.

434
00:21:33,405 --> 00:21:35,396
Brothers and sisters,
helpyourselves.

435
00:21:35,474 --> 00:21:38,500
Let the folks with
the wheelchairs through now.

436
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:40,636
That's right. Don't be shy.

437
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:41,645
Hello there.

438
00:21:41,714 --> 00:21:43,875
Welcome to the Miracle Ministry.

439
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:45,712
Y'all come to see Samuel tonight?

440
00:21:45,784 --> 00:21:46,978
Yes.

441
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:49,247
Will he be here?
The paper said--

442
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:51,152
Don't mind the papers.

443
00:21:51,223 --> 00:21:53,691
God's workwill be done.

444
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,885
Young Samuel will
cast out the devil

445
00:21:55,995 --> 00:21:57,360
and heal the sick.

446
00:21:57,429 --> 00:21:58,828
Did you hear that, honey?

447
00:21:58,897 --> 00:22:00,194
Could he see me?

448
00:22:00,265 --> 00:22:01,698
I'll tell you what--

449
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:03,860
I'll put in a special word, hmm?

450
00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:05,665
What's your name, darling?

451
00:22:05,738 --> 00:22:06,762
Margaret Hohman.

452
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,739
Margaret, you wait right here.

453
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:11,037
I'll see ifsomebody can putyou

454
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,338
in the front row.

455
00:22:12,411 --> 00:22:14,675
How's that, huh?

456
00:22:18,283 --> 00:22:22,583
I can't go out there,
not afterwhat's happened.

457
00:22:22,655 --> 00:22:25,385
God tests the faith
in us all, son.

458
00:22:25,457 --> 00:22:28,790
And because He has chosen you
to act in His likeness

459
00:22:28,894 --> 00:22:31,658
He has given you
the toughest test ofall.

460
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,255
Do not forsake
your gift, Samuel.

461
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:35,833
Aw, man.

462
00:22:38,337 --> 00:22:40,202
I'm a preacher, son.

463
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:42,137
That's my gift.

464
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:44,539
But all the preaching in the world

465
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,170
could never equal
even a small miracle

466
00:22:47,246 --> 00:22:49,578
in consolidating the faith and hope

467
00:22:49,648 --> 00:22:52,048
ofthese people.

468
00:22:52,117 --> 00:22:55,348
Let this man--
whose lifeyou saved--

469
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:59,050
give witness tonight
to the grace and goodness

470
00:22:59,124 --> 00:23:01,422
ofyour healing power.

471
00:23:02,995 --> 00:23:05,862
They're all waiting on you, Samuel.

472
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:09,094
Choir: *Ready, you got to be ready*

473
00:23:09,168 --> 00:23:12,535
*Ready, you got to be ready*

474
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:15,971
*Ready, you got to be ready*

475
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:19,442
*Ready, you got to be ready*

476
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:22,139
*Ready, you got to be ready*

477
00:23:22,214 --> 00:23:25,513
*Ready, you got to be ready*

478
00:23:25,584 --> 00:23:27,484
*Ready, ready, ready*

479
00:23:27,553 --> 00:23:31,011
*Ready, ready, ready*

480
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,025
*Ready, ready, ready*

481
00:23:34,126 --> 00:23:37,562
*ReadywhenJesus comes.*

482
00:23:37,663 --> 00:23:39,290
Yes, indeed!

483
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:41,263
Praise God!

484
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,062
Hallelujah!

485
00:23:43,135 --> 00:23:44,659
All: Hallelujah!

486
00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:46,034
Praise the Lord!

487
00:23:46,105 --> 00:23:47,504
All: Praise the Lord!

488
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,572
God is here tonight.

489
00:23:52,644 --> 00:23:53,838
Oh, yes.

490
00:23:53,912 --> 00:23:56,073
- (crowd murmurs agreement)
- Pass it down, please.

491
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:57,706
I feel His presence.

492
00:23:57,783 --> 00:23:58,875
Oh, amen!

493
00:23:58,951 --> 00:24:01,249
Apparently miracles
don't come cheap.

494
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,582
God is here

495
00:24:02,654 --> 00:24:04,212
and He...

496
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:06,189
is here...

497
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:07,656
to heal!

498
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,557
(cheering)

499
00:24:09,661 --> 00:24:11,492
Yes, heal!

500
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:13,087
Hallelujah.

501
00:24:13,198 --> 00:24:14,597
There's a man

502
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:17,499
I'd like
to introduce toyou--

503
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:20,003
a man who has seen
the face ofGod

504
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:23,906
but who was not satisfied
to go to that great place.

505
00:24:23,976 --> 00:24:27,412
No, God had work for him to do
right here on Earth.

506
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:31,006
As it is in heaven, mm-hmm.

507
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,608
I saw this man come back

508
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:35,880
from beyond death's door.

509
00:24:35,954 --> 00:24:40,323
He stands here today
as a living testament

510
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:43,451
to the ability ofGod

511
00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:45,393
to work miracles.

512
00:24:45,464 --> 00:24:47,022
Ladies and gentlemen

513
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:49,498
brothers and sisters...

514
00:24:49,568 --> 00:24:53,629
our beloved friend,
Leonard Vance.

515
00:24:57,309 --> 00:24:58,276
Leonard: As it says inJohn

516
00:24:58,343 --> 00:25:00,311
chapter three--

517
00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:04,213
" No man can do these miracles
unless God be with him."

518
00:25:04,283 --> 00:25:06,274
(murmurs ofagreement)

519
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:09,445
That man to whom I owe my life

520
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:11,216
is Samuel Hartley.

521
00:25:11,356 --> 00:25:13,290
And he is here tonight
to heal you.

522
00:25:13,392 --> 00:25:14,916
Hartley: Thankyou, Leonard.

523
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:16,494
Ladies and gentlemen--

524
00:25:16,595 --> 00:25:19,325
"God's soldier, Samuel Hartley".

525
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:21,263
(crowd clapping)

526
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,801
(gospel music begins)

527
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:27,768
Mulder!

528
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,071
(choir singing)

529
00:25:31,143 --> 00:25:34,271
*lt's time to seek the Lord*

530
00:25:34,346 --> 00:25:37,076
- *Find your daily time*
- Receive God's love.

531
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:39,640
*For the time
of His coming is near*

532
00:25:39,718 --> 00:25:42,687
- *For no man knows*
- Through the power ofGod.

533
00:25:42,754 --> 00:25:45,587
*The day nor the hour*

534
00:25:45,657 --> 00:25:48,490
*There is no time to waste*

535
00:25:48,594 --> 00:25:52,394
*You better get
your house in order*

536
00:25:52,464 --> 00:25:54,398
*Or it may be too late*

537
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:57,026
- *The Lord is coming*
- Praywith me.

538
00:25:57,102 --> 00:25:59,127
*Coming*

539
00:25:59,204 --> 00:26:01,570
*lt could be morning or night*

540
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,507
*l said He's coming*

541
00:26:04,576 --> 00:26:06,009
*Coming*

542
00:26:06,078 --> 00:26:08,569
- Closeyour eyes.
- *Tomorrow might be too late*

543
00:26:08,647 --> 00:26:09,841
*Will you be ready?*

544
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:12,383
*Ready, ready...*

545
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:15,045
(gasping)

546
00:26:17,089 --> 00:26:19,114
(gasping louder)

547
00:26:20,592 --> 00:26:21,616
(loud heaving)

548
00:26:21,727 --> 00:26:22,955
What haveyou done, boy?

549
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:24,551
All right, everyone,
remain calm.

550
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:26,893
Give this young woman some room.

551
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:28,523
Everybody praise God.

552
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:30,761
- Say hallelujah.
- Get an ambulance!

553
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:35,068
Don't panic now!
just praise the Lord!

554
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,664
Oh, my baby.

555
00:26:44,783 --> 00:26:45,977
She's dead.

556
00:26:46,051 --> 00:26:48,178
(sobbing)

557
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:09,604
My lovely friends, children ofGod

558
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:14,479
brothers and sisters

559
00:27:14,546 --> 00:27:17,037
ifyou desecrate the body

560
00:27:17,115 --> 00:27:20,642
then you slay the soul.

561
00:27:23,455 --> 00:27:27,255
Let's keep
this poorwoman's body intact.

562
00:27:29,127 --> 00:27:31,061
We know that Reverend Hartley's

563
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:32,528
been pressuring you

564
00:27:32,597 --> 00:27:34,895
but this is the third death linked

565
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:36,832
with the Miracle Ministry.

566
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:38,392
Reverend Hartley says

567
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,768
an autopsy is against Scripture.

568
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:44,002
What illness did your daughter
suffer from, Mr. Hohman?

569
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:46,237
She had M.S.

570
00:27:46,311 --> 00:27:48,779
Has she ever had
a seizure before this?

571
00:27:48,847 --> 00:27:50,815
Not to my knowledge.

572
00:27:50,882 --> 00:27:53,976
You see, I think
that the seizure she had

573
00:27:54,052 --> 00:27:58,113
is indicative ofsome kind
ofembolism or aneurysm.

574
00:27:58,223 --> 00:28:00,191
But the boy only touched
her forehead.

575
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:02,988
And areyou going
to be content

576
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:07,998
to bury herwithout knowing
the true cause ofdeath?

577
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:11,702
Without knowing
ifthere was foul play involved?

578
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:16,905
Give me a moment.

579
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:29,879
You think the boy really did it?

580
00:28:29,988 --> 00:28:31,819
No.

581
00:28:31,923 --> 00:28:33,584
Why not?

582
00:28:33,692 --> 00:28:35,626
I was raised a Catholic

583
00:28:35,694 --> 00:28:39,824
and I have a certain familiarity
with the Scripture

584
00:28:39,898 --> 00:28:43,925
and God never lets
the devil steal the show.

585
00:28:44,002 --> 00:28:46,095
You must have really liked
The Exorcist.

586
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:48,503
One ofmy favorite movies.

587
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:50,598
Well...

588
00:28:53,545 --> 00:28:56,241
So who wereyou pursuing
in the crowd tonight?

589
00:28:57,849 --> 00:29:00,511
I thought I saw someone I knew.

590
00:29:00,585 --> 00:29:03,349
That boy really has you going,
doesn't he?

591
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:05,616
Why doyou say that?

592
00:29:05,724 --> 00:29:07,817
In the bar,
Samuel mentioned your sister.

593
00:29:07,926 --> 00:29:11,089
Is ityour sister
you thinkyou're seeing?

594
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,428
I've seen her twice now.

595
00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:16,262
Maybeyoujust want to see her.

596
00:29:16,334 --> 00:29:18,564
I'm not delusional, Scully.

597
00:29:18,637 --> 00:29:20,969
Don't discount
the power ofsuggestion.

598
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,768
A healer's greatest magic

599
00:29:22,841 --> 00:29:25,776
Iies in the patient's
willingness to believe.

600
00:29:25,844 --> 00:29:27,937
Imagine a miracle,
you're halfway there.

601
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:30,140
We learned that in med school.

602
00:29:30,215 --> 00:29:32,206
You think this is
what Margaret Hohman

603
00:29:32,284 --> 00:29:34,548
or her parents were imagining?

604
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:43,928
We're going to go along
with your investigation.

605
00:29:54,272 --> 00:29:58,140
It's 1 1 :21 p.m., March 7.

606
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:02,306
Subject's name is Margaret Hohman.

607
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,905
Female, Caucasian

608
00:30:04,983 --> 00:30:07,008
1 07 pounds.

609
00:30:13,425 --> 00:30:14,790
Mulder, take a look at this.

610
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,452
Do I have to?

611
00:30:16,561 --> 00:30:18,085
Lesions on the lungs here.

612
00:30:18,196 --> 00:30:20,061
I'm finding them throughout
the cardiovascular

613
00:30:20,132 --> 00:30:22,498
and pulmonary systems.

614
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:25,502
There's also damage
to the mucous membranes.

615
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:29,336
She must have died
from cellular hypoxia.

616
00:30:29,407 --> 00:30:31,341
A lack ofoxygen to the cells.

617
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:32,899
What would cause that?

618
00:30:32,978 --> 00:30:34,969
My guess? lngestion or injection

619
00:30:35,046 --> 00:30:38,038
ofsodium or potassium cyanide,
maybe arsenic.

620
00:30:38,116 --> 00:30:39,276
I won't know exactly

621
00:30:39,351 --> 00:30:40,841
until I run
a toxicology screen on her.

622
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:41,851
How soon?

623
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,478
Lab opens in the morning.

624
00:30:43,588 --> 00:30:46,113
See whoyou can push to get it done--
as soon as possible.

625
00:30:46,224 --> 00:30:48,021
(door clanks shut)

626
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:58,795
(footsteps)

627
00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:05,670
Samuel, it's Agent Mulder.

628
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:08,269
Yeah? What doyou want?

629
00:31:08,346 --> 00:31:10,041
I want to talkwith you.

630
00:31:10,115 --> 00:31:11,980
Ifyou'd preferyour
attorneywere present...

631
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,450
Whatever. No.

632
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:18,319
I put a call in to Sheriff Daniels.
He's on his way down here.

633
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:23,453
- I'm going to ask him to releaseyou.
- Why areyou doing this?

634
00:31:23,562 --> 00:31:25,189
You were there, man.

635
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:26,992
You saw foryourself.

636
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:29,794
Did you poison Margaret Hohman?

637
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:31,836
Did I poison her?

638
00:31:31,903 --> 00:31:34,303
Did you poison her
using potassium or sodium cyanide?

639
00:31:34,372 --> 00:31:35,999
Because that's what killed her.

640
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:37,803
What areyou talking about?

641
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:41,277
You're innocent, Samuel.

642
00:31:41,346 --> 00:31:45,146
Unless you had a hand in
administering it. I don't thinkyou did.

643
00:31:45,217 --> 00:31:49,085
Whatever the cause, Mr. Mulder,
I am responsible.

644
00:31:49,154 --> 00:31:51,054
Evidence will be presented tomorrow.

645
00:31:51,122 --> 00:31:53,283
Habeas corpus law
will force them to releaseyou.

646
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:54,825
You should go home
and get some rest.

647
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:57,087
just leave me alone, okay?

648
00:31:57,195 --> 00:31:59,663
Ifyou think the punishment
foryour sins

649
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:01,665
is the deaths ofthose people...

650
00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:04,201
The Lord has testified against me.

651
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:07,329
I can't stand here and argue
with your biblical rhetoric

652
00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:09,965
but I do know that the law
will find you innocent.

653
00:32:17,048 --> 00:32:21,508
You said you could see my pain.

654
00:32:21,586 --> 00:32:22,518
Look at me.

655
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:27,720
What doyou see now?

656
00:32:27,826 --> 00:32:30,693
I see nothing.

657
00:32:31,763 --> 00:32:34,323
I am blind.

658
00:32:34,432 --> 00:32:36,059
I don't believeyou.

659
00:32:36,134 --> 00:32:37,761
I've seen her.

660
00:32:37,836 --> 00:32:40,361
It was her, wasn't it?

661
00:32:40,438 --> 00:32:42,235
Your sister?

662
00:32:42,307 --> 00:32:44,400
You made her appear to me,
didn'tyou?

663
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:47,410
Look at me.

664
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:49,709
I am very tired, Mr. Mulder.

665
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:51,146
Is she alive?!

666
00:32:51,216 --> 00:32:54,014
Is that what I'm supposed
to believe

667
00:32:54,085 --> 00:32:55,780
or is this a trick?

668
00:32:55,854 --> 00:32:57,719
You mean...

669
00:32:57,789 --> 00:33:01,225
a trick ofthe devil?

670
00:33:01,293 --> 00:33:03,761
(exasperated sigh)

671
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:06,228
jailer!

672
00:33:22,814 --> 00:33:25,180
I see I'm a little late
for the ball.

673
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,150
I wanted you to release the boy.

674
00:33:27,218 --> 00:33:28,310
On what pretense?

675
00:33:28,386 --> 00:33:29,410
His innocence.

676
00:33:29,487 --> 00:33:31,978
Aren'tyou out ofyour depth here?

677
00:33:32,057 --> 00:33:34,184
This may be Hicksville toyou

678
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:36,283
but we do try and hew
to the legal system.

679
00:33:36,394 --> 00:33:39,056
He seems determined
to stay here anyway.

680
00:33:39,164 --> 00:33:41,598
What does that tell you?

681
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:43,497
It tells meyou're determined
to have him charged

682
00:33:43,568 --> 00:33:47,060
whileyour real homicide suspect
is still at large.

683
00:33:51,976 --> 00:33:54,274
(footsteps)

684
00:34:04,823 --> 00:34:07,348
Got some company forya, Sam.

685
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:17,632
(grunting)

686
00:34:19,537 --> 00:34:21,528
What areyou looking at?

687
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:39,889
(doorbell rings)

688
00:34:43,061 --> 00:34:44,392
I'll get it.

689
00:34:44,462 --> 00:34:46,362
I'll get it.

690
00:34:53,304 --> 00:34:55,431
Ma'am, Sheriff.

691
00:34:55,507 --> 00:34:57,532
Hey, Dennis. How areya?

692
00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:00,407
just fine, ma'am,just fine.

693
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:02,571
Except we had an incident
down at thejail.

694
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:04,171
What incident, Tyson?

695
00:35:04,249 --> 00:35:06,547
The preacher boy.

696
00:35:06,618 --> 00:35:08,586
He's dead.

697
00:35:17,028 --> 00:35:19,496
He was alone in his cell
when Mulder left him this morning.

698
00:35:19,564 --> 00:35:21,464
How could this have happened?

699
00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:23,160
The boy started a fight

700
00:35:23,234 --> 00:35:26,169
with a couple ofrowdies
we picked up on a D.U.I.

701
00:35:26,237 --> 00:35:28,034
Took some mean blows to the head.

702
00:35:28,106 --> 00:35:31,906
Died before the ambulance got here.

703
00:35:31,976 --> 00:35:33,341
His blood is spilled

704
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:34,935
and it's all overyou!

705
00:35:35,013 --> 00:35:36,105
Reverend...

706
00:35:40,218 --> 00:35:41,412
How much longer

707
00:35:41,486 --> 00:35:43,977
areyou going to hide
behind that badge

708
00:35:44,055 --> 00:35:46,353
before the truth is revealed?

709
00:35:46,424 --> 00:35:47,857
I have work to do.

710
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:50,120
Reverend Hartley...

711
00:35:52,664 --> 00:35:54,154
we're sorry foryour loss.

712
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:58,565
That boy... he was blessed.

713
00:35:58,636 --> 00:36:00,627
He never hurt a soul.

714
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:01,797
Vance: Come on there, Reverend.

715
00:36:01,873 --> 00:36:03,670
Our friends will find out
about Samuel

716
00:36:03,741 --> 00:36:05,504
sooner than later,
and, well...

717
00:36:05,577 --> 00:36:07,875
it's probably best
ifthey hear it from you.

718
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:09,243
Come on.

719
00:36:09,314 --> 00:36:11,214
Ma'am.

720
00:36:15,954 --> 00:36:17,649
You got that look
on your face, Mulder.

721
00:36:17,722 --> 00:36:20,589
What look is that?

722
00:36:20,658 --> 00:36:22,091
The kind when you've
forgotten your keys

723
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:23,626
and you're trying
to figure out

724
00:36:23,695 --> 00:36:24,719
how to get back
in the house.

725
00:36:32,403 --> 00:36:34,769
What exactly
are we trying to find?

726
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:36,101
Clues.

727
00:36:36,174 --> 00:36:37,971
Oh.

728
00:36:54,259 --> 00:36:56,250
What does it mean?

729
00:36:59,864 --> 00:37:01,559
Mulder: Let's find out.

730
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:14,708
Scully.

731
00:37:16,414 --> 00:37:18,541
It's potato.

732
00:37:20,351 --> 00:37:22,148
Someone left a trail offood

733
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,314
in the ventilation system
leading to the courtroom.

734
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,381
You dumpyour locusts in here...

735
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:29,358
instant plague.

736
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,757
Where do they come from?

737
00:37:30,862 --> 00:37:32,261
Biological supply houses

738
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:35,094
hatch them on order
to farms and universities.

739
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:38,226
Shouldn't be too hard
to find out who set this up.

740
00:37:38,303 --> 00:37:40,396
And you think
whoever did this

741
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:43,167
is responsible
for the murders.

742
00:38:08,499 --> 00:38:09,727
(frightened gasp)

743
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:15,031
You're dead.

744
00:38:15,106 --> 00:38:17,301
They killed you.

745
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:19,900
I was dead...

746
00:38:19,978 --> 00:38:21,639
but here I am.

747
00:38:21,713 --> 00:38:23,010
No!

748
00:38:23,081 --> 00:38:24,878
Why did you betray me?

749
00:38:29,053 --> 00:38:31,521
You murdered those people.

750
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:35,423
They came to me to be healed

751
00:38:35,526 --> 00:38:38,359
and you murdered them.

752
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:39,862
Why?

753
00:38:39,931 --> 00:38:42,923
After I gaveyou backyour life.

754
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:45,901
You call this life?!

755
00:38:48,373 --> 00:38:49,931
(knocking)

756
00:38:52,477 --> 00:38:54,377
What in tarnation doyou want?

757
00:38:54,445 --> 00:38:55,605
We have a warrant

758
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,671
for the arrest of Leonard Vance.

759
00:38:57,749 --> 00:38:58,909
Where is he?

760
00:38:58,983 --> 00:39:00,041
You must be mistaken.

761
00:39:00,118 --> 00:39:02,018
Scully: Afraid not, Reverend.

762
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:04,020
We traced
a pesticide order to him

763
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:05,555
from a chemical company.

764
00:39:05,623 --> 00:39:06,715
Cyanogen bromide--

765
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,554
It's a cyanide derivative.

766
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,857
Leonard poisoned those people?

767
00:39:11,963 --> 00:39:14,454
(whimpering)

768
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:20,532
Getyour clothes on, Vance.

769
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:22,038
You're under arrest.

770
00:39:22,106 --> 00:39:24,336
I betrayed him.

771
00:39:25,777 --> 00:39:27,210
Cyanide.

772
00:39:27,278 --> 00:39:30,179
There's no way to tell
how much he's ingested.

773
00:39:30,248 --> 00:39:31,875
I'll call an ambulance.

774
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:34,645
We have to get him
to the hospital ourselves.

775
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:37,984
I thought,
"Why didn't he let me die?"

776
00:39:38,056 --> 00:39:39,683
Beware offalse prophets

777
00:39:39,757 --> 00:39:42,089
who come toyou
in sheep's clothing

778
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:46,152
but inwardly
are ravening wolves.

779
00:39:46,264 --> 00:39:48,459
That's what I thought he was

780
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:51,161
because who else would bring me back

781
00:39:51,235 --> 00:39:53,538
Iooking like this?

782
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:55,798
He was here.

783
00:39:55,873 --> 00:39:58,398
- Who?
- Samuel.

784
00:39:58,509 --> 00:40:00,101
The man's delirious.

785
00:40:00,211 --> 00:40:01,872
He was here, Reverend.

786
00:40:01,979 --> 00:40:03,503
Right in this room...

787
00:40:03,614 --> 00:40:07,345
and he forgave me.

788
00:40:07,418 --> 00:40:10,478
(choking gasp)

789
00:40:17,729 --> 00:40:19,697
Scully: Rather than
simply killing Samuel

790
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:22,858
Vance contrived to kill
the ministry's faith in him.

791
00:40:22,934 --> 00:40:24,561
We have conclusive evidence

792
00:40:24,635 --> 00:40:27,536
connecting him both
to the courtroom infestation

793
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:29,266
and to the poisoning deaths

794
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,535
ofthree members ofthe ministry.

795
00:40:32,877 --> 00:40:35,345
Vance's obsession
outlived Samuel however.

796
00:40:35,446 --> 00:40:38,813
His conscience haunted him
until he became delusory

797
00:40:38,883 --> 00:40:40,817
and finally took his own life

798
00:40:40,885 --> 00:40:43,376
effectively ending
our investigation.

799
00:40:43,454 --> 00:40:45,615
In light ofthis information

800
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,157
it is highly doubtful

801
00:40:47,225 --> 00:40:49,955
that there have ever been
any miracles

802
00:40:50,027 --> 00:40:51,585
in Kenwood, Tennessee.

803
00:40:51,662 --> 00:40:53,960
(phone rings)

804
00:40:57,535 --> 00:40:59,730
Mulder.

805
00:40:59,804 --> 00:41:02,034
(knock at door)

806
00:41:02,907 --> 00:41:05,637
Scully?

807
00:41:07,678 --> 00:41:09,509
Sheriff Danielsjust called.

808
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,447
Samuel's body is missing
from the morgue.

809
00:41:16,687 --> 00:41:18,018
Anywitnesses?

810
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:19,420
One, so far.

811
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:22,050
The night nurse
who made the report--

812
00:41:22,126 --> 00:41:23,718
Beatrice Salinger.

813
00:41:23,795 --> 00:41:25,456
She saw somebody take him?

814
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:26,861
Not actually.

815
00:41:26,931 --> 00:41:28,023
What doyou mean?

816
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:29,999
Talk sense, Deputy.

817
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:32,729
She didn't exactly see
anyone taking the body.

818
00:41:32,804 --> 00:41:33,896
Well, what then?

819
00:41:33,971 --> 00:41:36,030
She, uh...

820
00:41:36,107 --> 00:41:38,940
she claims she saw Samuel
walking out by himself.

821
00:41:39,043 --> 00:41:44,037
Sounds crazy, I know,
but that's what she told me.

822
00:41:44,148 --> 00:41:45,843
You coming, Sheriff?

823
00:41:50,888 --> 00:41:52,947
I was drinking my coffee

824
00:41:53,024 --> 00:41:54,821
and going over the night orders

825
00:41:54,892 --> 00:41:57,190
for myward, seven south,

826
00:41:57,261 --> 00:41:58,922
when he walked right by me.

827
00:41:58,996 --> 00:42:01,123
His face was all black and blue.

828
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,689
You're sure it was him.

829
00:42:02,767 --> 00:42:06,100
Well, at first I thought
my eyes were playing tricks

830
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,832
which happens a lot on graveyard

831
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:10,771
so I got up to look again

832
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:12,502
but I lost him around a corner.

833
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:15,272
Hejust vanished.

834
00:42:15,379 --> 00:42:16,846
Then I went to check the morgue

835
00:42:16,914 --> 00:42:19,075
and his bodywas gone.

836
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,550
Daniels: This is insane.

837
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:24,349
I won't listen to any more
ofthis crazy talk.

838
00:42:24,422 --> 00:42:26,913
I'm not the only one
who saw him, Sheriff

839
00:42:26,991 --> 00:42:28,618
so I know I'm not crazy.

840
00:42:28,693 --> 00:42:30,627
Other people saw him too.

841
00:42:35,066 --> 00:42:38,001
I'm not crazy.

842
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:39,297
It was Samuel.

843
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:09,961
Lillian: This isn't true,
Maurice, is it?

844
00:43:10,034 --> 00:43:11,797
The boywas an awful fake

845
00:43:11,869 --> 00:43:15,236
just likeyou said,
wasn't he, Maurice?

846
00:43:19,477 --> 00:43:21,172
Wasn't he, Maurice?

847
00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:28,778
(knocking)

848
00:43:37,428 --> 00:43:38,360
Sir...

849
00:43:38,429 --> 00:43:39,896
going to have to askyou

850
00:43:39,964 --> 00:43:41,192
to come with me.

851
00:43:41,265 --> 00:43:42,562
District Attorney

852
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:44,567
wants to askyou
some questions

853
00:43:44,635 --> 00:43:46,830
concerning the boy's death.

854
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,469
Sundays will probably
never be the same again

855
00:43:54,578 --> 00:43:55,875
in these parts.

856
00:43:55,947 --> 00:43:57,642
I have a strong sense
the Reverend Hartley

857
00:43:57,715 --> 00:43:59,774
is not going to be able
to give up the pulpit.

858
00:43:59,884 --> 00:44:01,875
Even without his son?

859
00:44:01,953 --> 00:44:04,285
Might even strengthen his faith.

860
00:44:04,355 --> 00:44:06,289
The boy did rise from the dead.

861
00:44:06,357 --> 00:44:09,349
That kind ofthing happens
only once or twice

862
00:44:09,427 --> 00:44:10,860
every 2,000 years or so.

863
00:44:10,928 --> 00:44:13,988
Yeah, and I have a story
about a plague oflocusts.

864
00:44:14,065 --> 00:44:15,726
I just hope Reverend Hartley

865
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,768
didn't arrange his body snatching

866
00:44:17,835 --> 00:44:19,427
as his miracle ofmiracles.

867
00:44:19,503 --> 00:44:20,970
Somehow, I don't think so.

868
00:44:21,038 --> 00:44:22,596
What exactly doyou think?

869
00:44:22,673 --> 00:44:25,369
I think people
are looking hard for miracles.

870
00:44:25,476 --> 00:44:28,036
So hard that maybe
they make themselves see

871
00:44:28,145 --> 00:44:29,544
what theywant to see.

872
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:46,455
You coming, Mulder?

873
00:45:40,284 --> 00:45:41,979
I made this.
