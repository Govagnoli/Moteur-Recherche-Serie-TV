just like that.

323
00:25:37,382 --> 00:25:40,840
-[Sonic Beeping increases]
- What was that ?

324
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:42,978
It ain't no bass.

325
00:25:43,055 --> 00:25:44,989
[ Beeping Continues ]

326
00:25:45,057 --> 00:25:47,150
What is that ?

327
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:53,063
- What is that, Mulder ?
- [ Beeping increases ]

328
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:56,532
- There be monsters, Scully.
- It looks like it's coming
straight at us.

329
00:25:56,602 --> 00:26:00,060
- Yep, that's what it looks like.
-[Beeping increases]

[Crashing]

331
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:12,941
Mayday ! Mayday !
Does anybody read me ?

332
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:17,979
This is a distress call
from the Patricia Rae.

333
00:26:18,056 --> 00:26:22,516
PA7A3A27.
I'm on a signal--

334
00:26:22,594 --> 00:26:25,825
[Crashing Continues]

335
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:32,168
- Mayday ! Mayday !
- Scully, let's get outta here !

336
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:07,703
There goes
our $500 deposit.

337
00:27:11,443 --> 00:27:14,776
- [ Sighs ] I say we swim to shore.
- Swim ?

338
00:27:14,846 --> 00:27:17,747
Yeah. The shore can't be
too far from here.

339
00:27:17,816 --> 00:27:19,750
In which direction ?

340
00:27:28,193 --> 00:27:32,755
Yeah. And, you know,
livin' in the city, you forget
that night is actually so, uh,

341
00:27:32,831 --> 00:27:35,095
dark.

342
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,192
Living in the city
you forget a lot of things.

343
00:27:38,303 --> 00:27:43,366
You know, there you’re always thinking
about being mugged or hit by a car.

344
00:27:43,442 --> 00:27:47,572
It's not until you get back to nature
until you realize that everything
is out to get you.

345
00:27:48,814 --> 00:27:51,647
That's what my father
always taught me--

346
00:27:51,717 --> 00:27:57,622
to respect nature, 'cause
it has no respect for you.

347
00:28:00,926 --> 00:28:03,622

[Scully Panting]

350
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:28,386
That was him, Scully.
That was Big Blue.

351
00:28:30,022 --> 00:28:32,490
So what if it was ?

352
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:39,429
- Mulder, what are we doing here ?
- What do you mean,
"what are we doing here ?"

353
00:28:39,531 --> 00:28:41,522
What are you hoping
to accomplish ?

354
00:28:43,502 --> 00:28:47,529
[ Sighs ] Scully, so many of the
things we investigate are so intangible.

355
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:52,667
But this creature exists within the
specific earthly confines of this lake,

356
00:28:52,744 --> 00:28:55,781
- and I want to find it.
- What for ?

357
00:28:55,914 --> 00:28:59,680
You're a scientist.
Why do you ask that question ?
It would be a miraculous discovery.

358
00:28:59,751 --> 00:29:03,050
It could revolutionize
evolutionary biological thinking.

359
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:07,455
- Is that really the reason why ?
- [ Sighs ]

360
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:11,017
You know when you showed me those
pictures that the photographer took ?

361
00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:13,427
You wanna know
what I really saw in them ?

362
00:29:13,498 --> 00:29:15,966
- A tooth ?
- No. You.

363
00:29:16,034 --> 00:29:20,130
That man is your future--
Listening only to himself,

364
00:29:20,205 --> 00:29:25,302
hoping to catch a glimpse of the truth
for who knows what reason.

365
00:29:25,377 --> 00:29:28,175
Well, I did read in his journals
that he was hoping to live off
the copyright fees...

366
00:29:28,246 --> 00:29:30,180
from a genuine Big Blue photo.

367
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:36,177
Well, as dumb as it sounds,
at least it's a legitimate reason.

368
00:29:36,254 --> 00:29:38,313
You don't think
my reasons are legitimate ?

369
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:42,025
Mulder, sometimes
I just can't figure them out.

370
00:29:44,362 --> 00:29:46,990
[Soft Splashing]

371
00:29:53,572 --> 00:29:55,836
Mulder.

372

[Quacking]

373
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,520
[ Laughs ]

374
00:30:10,589 --> 00:30:14,150
- [ Quacking Continues ]
- I'm still tempted to fire.

375
00:30:20,832 --> 00:30:24,165
Hey, Scully, do you think
you could ever cannibalize someone.

376
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:27,000
I mean, if you really had to.

377
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,836
Well, as much as the very idea
is abhorrent to me,

378
00:30:29,908 --> 00:30:35,244
I suppose under certain conditions
a living entity is practically
conditioned...

379
00:30:35,313 --> 00:30:40,910
to perform whatever extreme measures
are necessary to ensure its survival.

380
00:30:40,986 --> 00:30:44,046
I suppose I'm no different.

381
00:30:44,122 --> 00:30:46,352
You've lost some weight
recently, haven’t you ?

382
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:48,585
Yeah. Actually, I have.
Thanks for--

383
00:30:51,363 --> 00:30:54,298
[ Chuckling ] But it is amazing
what some animals will do...

384
00:30:54,366 --> 00:30:57,563
to guarantee the continuation
of a species, isn't it ?

385
00:30:57,636 --> 00:31:00,935
I mean, a creature of this size
must have adapted its behavior
over the years...

386
00:31:01,006 --> 00:31:04,772
to minimize its chances of being seen
by its only predator-- us.

387
00:31:04,843 --> 00:31:09,576
Its coming closer to shore
for its prey must be an act
of desperation on its part.

388
00:31:09,648 --> 00:31:11,843
Poor Queequeg.

389
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:18,122
Why did you name
the dog "Queequeg" ?

390
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:21,853
It was the name of the harpoonist
in Moby Dick.

391
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,363
My father used to read to me from
Moby Dick when I was a little girl.

392
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,194
I called him 'Ahab, "and
he called me "Starbuck. "

393
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:31,963
So I named my dog Queequeg.

394
00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:36,407
That's funny.
I just realized something.

395
00:31:36,474 --> 00:31:39,568
- It's a bizarre name for a dog, huh ?
- No.

396
00:31:39,644 --> 00:31:42,306
How much you're
like Ahab.

397
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:48,012
You’re so consumed by your
personal vengeance against life,

398
00:31:48,086 --> 00:31:51,681
whether it be its inherent
cruelties or its mysteries,

399
00:31:51,756 --> 00:31:57,490
that everything takes on
a warped significance to fit
your megalomaniacal cosmology.

400
00:31:57,562 --> 00:31:59,962
Scully,
are you coming on to me ?

401
00:32:00,031 --> 00:32:05,833
It’s just--
The truth or a white whale--
what difference does it make ?

402
00:32:05,904 --> 00:32:09,203
Both obsessions are
impossible to capture,

403
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:11,265
and trying to do so
will only leave you dead...

404
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:14,278
along with everyone else
you bring with you.

405
00:32:14,346 --> 00:32:16,337
You know, Mulder,
you are Ahab.

406
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:22,253
You know, it's interesting
you should say that, because
I've always wanted a peg leg.

407
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,948
It's a boyhood thing
I never grew out of.

408
00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:27,992
No, I'm not being flippant. I mean,
I've given this a lot of thought.

409
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:30,527
If you have a peg leg
or hooks for hands,

410
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:32,927
you know, maybe it's enough
to simply carry on living--

411
00:32:32,998 --> 00:32:35,592
you know, bravely facing life
with your disability.

412
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:39,194
It's heroic just to survive.
But without these things,
you're actually expected...

413
00:32:39,271 --> 00:32:43,207
to make something of your life-- achieve
something, earn a raise, wear a necktie.

414
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:46,540
So-So-So, if anything,
I'm actually the antithesis of Ahab,

415
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:50,604
because if I did have a peg leg
I'd quite possibly be more happy
and more content...

416
00:32:50,682 --> 00:32:54,118
and not feel the need to chase after
these creatures of the unknown.

417
00:32:54,185 --> 00:32:57,848
- And that's not flippant ?
- [ Laughing ] No.

418
00:32:57,922 --> 00:33:01,187
Flippant is my favorite line
from Moby Dick:

419
00:33:01,293 --> 00:33:04,421
" Hell is an idea first born on
an undigested apple dumpling."

420
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:06,463
Yeah.

421
00:33:06,598 --> 00:33:08,862
[Splashing]

422
00:33:17,942 --> 00:33:20,968
[Splashing Resumes,
Louder]

423
00:33:21,046 --> 00:33:23,480
- What was that ?
- I don't know, but it ain't no duck.

424
00:33:25,884 --> 00:33:29,183
[Splashing Continues]

425
00:33:39,197 --> 00:33:41,131
[ Panting ]

426
00:33:45,003 --> 00:33:47,494
I thought I heard voices.
What are you two doing out here ?

427
00:33:47,605 --> 00:33:51,041
- Dr. Faraday ?
- Hope I'm not interrupting anything.

428
00:33:51,142 --> 00:33:54,839
No. No. We, uh--
we had a little trouble with our boat.

429
00:33:54,913 --> 00:33:57,746
- Actually, it sank.
- How'd that happen ?

430
00:33:57,816 --> 00:34:00,785
It was my fault.
[ Sighs ]

431
00:34:00,852 --> 00:34:04,219
We would have been out here all night if
you hadn't answered our distress call.

432
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:06,917
Oh, I didn't. I was walking by.
I heard you talking.

433
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,521
- Walking by ?
- Yeah.

434
00:34:10,595 --> 00:34:13,792
Yeah, the shore is just
a stone's throw from here.

435
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:18,532
[ Chuckling ]
Come on. I'll take you back.

436
00:34:40,825 --> 00:34:44,261
It was just out of fuel.
I think the sheriff will
be along in a couple minutes.

437
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:46,854
I'd drive you myself,
but I've got work to do.

438
00:34:46,931 --> 00:34:51,095
What exactly is it that you’re
doing out here, Dr. Faraday ?
It's well after midnight.

439
00:34:51,202 --> 00:34:53,693
Well, night is rhinus venisefula's
most active period,

440
00:34:53,805 --> 00:34:56,273
and this is
its primary breeding ground,

441
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:58,308
or at least it used to be.

442
00:34:58,376 --> 00:35:01,573
Thousands of eggs used
to cling to these reeds--

443
00:35:01,646 --> 00:35:04,547
beautiful jelly clusters.

444
00:35:04,616 --> 00:35:09,076
Now one must turn over many a leaf
in order to find potential offspring.

445
00:35:09,154 --> 00:35:11,645
- What's in the sack ?
- Adult frogs.

446
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:14,692
I've been breeding them in captivity
and releasing them into the wild.

447
00:35:16,127 --> 00:35:18,721
[Scully]
This is Striker’s Cove ?

448
00:35:18,797 --> 00:35:20,992
- Mm-hmm.
- The frogs--

449
00:35:21,065 --> 00:35:24,592
- I beg your pardon ?
- The unexplained depletion of
frogs originates from this cove.

450
00:35:24,702 --> 00:35:28,297
- It's the food chain.
- What about it ?

451
00:35:28,406 --> 00:35:30,806
The food chain. If you alter
one life-form in an ecosystem,

452
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:34,606
the rest is necessarily affected,
either by an increase or decrease.

453
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:37,910
So, if an aquatic dinosaur's
diet consisted primarily of frogs,

454
00:35:37,982 --> 00:35:42,248
then if those frogs became scarce,
it would have to turn
to an alternative food source.

455
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,845
- Humans.
- Agent Mulder,

456
00:35:44,923 --> 00:35:49,690
you are taking my legitimate research
and basic biological principle...

457
00:35:49,761 --> 00:35:52,161
and stretching them both
way out of proportion...

458
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:55,825
in an effort to give
some kind of validity
to an entirely ludicrous theory.

459
00:35:55,934 --> 00:35:58,402
There is no prehistoric
lake monster.

460
00:35:58,503 --> 00:36:02,564
This creature lives here in this cove.
That explains the disappearance
of these frogs,

461
00:36:02,674 --> 00:36:05,609
for which you have no explanation,
Doctor, ludicrous or not,

462
00:36:05,677 --> 00:36:08,043
- as well as the recent human attacks.
- That's crazy!

463
00:36:08,112 --> 00:36:11,673
If something was living in these waters,
you don't think I would've seen it ?

464
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:13,876
I’ve been conducting research
here for three years.

465
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:17,786
I'm talking about a prehistoric animal
that's gone unnoticed for virtually
thousands of years.

466
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:19,983
If it knows how to do anything,
it knows how to hide.

467
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:23,858
They say the Loch Ness Monster
doesn't live in the water,
it lives in the surrounding cliffs.

468
00:36:23,928 --> 00:36:29,560
Maybe Big Blue has an inland habitat,
somewhere in the rocks
or in this dense forest here.

469
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:32,135
I have no time
for these absurdities.

470
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:38,235
If you’ll excuse me,
I have some amphibians to release.

471
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:43,413
Well, Captain, what now ?

472
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:47,144
- [ Sighs ]
-[Sheriff]
Agent Scully! Agent Mulder!

473
00:36:47,218 --> 00:36:49,652
There's been another death,

474
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:54,090
and this time it does appear to
be some kind of animal attack--
bit a fisherman's arm clean off.

475
00:36:54,158 --> 00:36:57,184
- Where did this happen ?
- Other side of the lake,
couple hours ago.

476
00:36:57,262 --> 00:36:59,753
My department has the cooperation
of the state police,

477
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:02,698
plus the full use of all the Wildlife
Fish and Game Department vessels.

478
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,927
I got a full-scale
water search already underway.

479
00:37:05,036 --> 00:37:08,130
No, we need those men here,
searching this cove and these woods.

480
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:12,073
But I got 30 boats on the water already.
If we’re gonna kill this thing--

481
00:37:12,143 --> 00:37:15,408
We gotta sweep this cove.
It's here at Striker's Cove.

482
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,280
The boats are searching
the area of the latest attack,
and I'm not gonna move them.

483
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,183
Now, if you wanna waste your time
conducting a search of these woods,

484
00:37:22,253 --> 00:37:24,847
you go right ahead--
I got me a lake monster to catch.

Sheriff,

487
00:37:30,128 --> 00:37:32,562
Agent Mulder and I would appreciate it
if you could spare us...

488
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,064
two or three of your men
to assist us here.

All right. I'll send 'em on back.

- My leg-- something grabbed my leg.

496
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:13,327
- Did you see it ?
- No. [Grunts]

497
00:38:13,404 --> 00:38:17,864
It came from behind me.
Before I knew it, it had me--
shaking me back and forth.

498
00:38:17,942 --> 00:38:20,740
- Then it just let go.
- Give me your belt.

499
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:26,548
- I didn't want to believe you.
- I think you nicked an artery.

We've gotta get him to a hospital.
He's losing blood.

- Where'd it go ?
- I didn't see it.
I didn't see it. [ Groans ]

00:38:31,956 --> 00:38:35,790
I think I heard-- It went through

All right, then. Go ahead.

that peg leg. [ Laughs ]
- How can you be disappointed ?

523
00:41:10,948 --> 00:41:14,349
That alligator would have gone
through the local population
if you hadn't killed it.

I know.

525

I guess I just wanted
Big Blue to be real.

I guess I see hope
in such a possibility.
