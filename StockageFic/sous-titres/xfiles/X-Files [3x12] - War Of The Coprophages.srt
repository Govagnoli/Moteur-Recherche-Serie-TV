themselves in this country.

- But do they attack people ?
- I'm suggesting that what's
happening out there...

Look, I think
I may have a lead.

Remember that Dr. Eckerle who was
the alternative fuel researcher...

the exterminator's death ?

508
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,320
Well, the fuel that he's researching
is methane gas.

Methane derived from manure.

to bring in animal dung samples
from outside the country.

Now, maybe you can
confirm this with your Dr. Bambi,

are dung-eaters.

514

have been shipped accidentally
in some of the samples.
