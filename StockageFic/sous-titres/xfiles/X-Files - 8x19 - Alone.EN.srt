1
00:00:22,703 --> 00:00:24,637
It's freezing out there.

2
00:00:24,705 --> 00:00:26,935
MAN:
You weren't gone long.

3
00:00:30,444 --> 00:00:33,345
Did you do
what I asked?

4
00:00:33,413 --> 00:00:34,971
Yes.

5
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:37,846
It's important, Gary.

6
00:00:37,918 --> 00:00:40,113
Promise me you did it.

7
00:00:40,354 --> 00:00:41,378
You're sick, Dad.

8
00:00:41,455 --> 00:00:43,047
You should be in a hospital

9
00:00:43,123 --> 00:00:45,921
not stuck out here
in the middle of nowhere.

10
00:00:45,992 --> 00:00:48,620
You don't owe this guy Stites
anything.

11
00:00:48,695 --> 00:00:50,720
It's not about owing.

12
00:00:50,797 --> 00:00:52,128
I freeze my butt off

13
00:00:52,332 --> 00:00:55,631
checking and rechecking
the locks every night.

14
00:00:55,669 --> 00:00:56,727
For what?

15
00:00:56,803 --> 00:00:59,636
You don't need to know.

16
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:01,971
Yeah, that's for sure.

17
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:04,340
I'm going to fiix some dinner.

18
00:01:09,483 --> 00:01:10,609
( door closes )

19
00:01:10,684 --> 00:01:14,552
( monitor beeping
soft, slowtones )

20
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,937
( windows flapping )

21
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:37,568
( beeping speeds up )

22
00:01:43,617 --> 00:01:45,676
( fast, rhythmic beeps )

23
00:01:45,752 --> 00:01:46,912
( groans softly )

24
00:01:49,823 --> 00:01:52,849
( groaning weakly )

25
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:55,918
( monitor beeping faster )

26
00:01:58,498 --> 00:02:01,467
( rapid beeping )

27
00:02:06,106 --> 00:02:08,040
Oh, Lord.

28
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:11,077
Gary, you didn't--

29
00:02:12,212 --> 00:02:13,975
( microwave beeps )

30
00:02:16,616 --> 00:02:18,550
Oh, whew.

31
00:02:21,855 --> 00:02:24,449
( steady tone )

32
00:02:24,524 --> 00:02:25,718
Oh, God.

33
00:02:30,063 --> 00:02:31,655
Dad?

34
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:35,690
( steady tone )

35
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:39,166
( tone stops )

36
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:06,793
( soft rattling )

37
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:27,246
DOGGETT :
Agent Scully.

38
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:34,120
Mmm.

39
00:04:34,187 --> 00:04:36,985
Can I take your coat?

40
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:39,821
I'm not staying, Agent Doggett.

41
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:45,262
My doctor told me
to take my maternity leave.

42
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:48,563
In fact, she insisted on it.

43
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:50,229
That's not bad, Agent Scully.

44
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,703
You could use some time
for yourself.

45
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:04,045
What is it?

46
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:08,747
It's a medallion commemorating
the Apollo 11 space flight.

47
00:05:08,822 --> 00:05:13,259
I'd like to give this
to you, Agent Doggett.

48
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:15,886
Thanks.

49
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:22,063
Because?

50
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:25,298
Agent Mulder gave it to me
a few years back.

51
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:29,741
It symbolizes teamwork...

52
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:32,300
partnership.

53
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:37,407
It means
no one gets there alone.

54
00:05:37,651 --> 00:05:41,018
And after this past year
and...

55
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:44,820
everything that we've
been through, I just--

56
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:50,420
I wouldn't be here without you.

57
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:20,082
Agent Scully.

58
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,960
This pregnancy leave...

59
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,964
it's just a ""leave,'' right?

60
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:30,969
I mean...you are coming back
eventually?

61
00:07:12,112 --> 00:07:14,171
( footsteps approaching )

62
00:07:14,247 --> 00:07:16,408
You're not gone fiive minutes,
Agent Scully

63
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:20,078
and already I'm starting to feel
like a stranger in my own off--

64
00:07:20,153 --> 00:07:21,882
I'm sorry?

65
00:07:21,955 --> 00:07:24,253
Can I help you?

66
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,349
I'm here to help
you, actually.

67
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:27,859
I'm Leyla Harrison.

68
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:31,727
I've been looking
forward to meeting you.

69
00:07:31,798 --> 00:07:33,459
Uh-huh.

70
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:36,400
I've got a case here,
an X-File, I think.

71
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:38,300
At least the local PD
can't explain it.

72
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:40,305
A murder last night
in upstate New York.

73
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:42,841
I booked us on a flight
to Buffalo Niagara.

74
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,137
Here's the crime report.

75
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,338
I'm sorry, Ms. Harrison...

76
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:48,937
who are you?

77
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:51,449
Oh, gosh.

78
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:53,247
They didn't tell you?

79
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:57,856
This is... so embarrassing.

80
00:07:57,924 --> 00:08:03,123
Uh, I'm... I'm
your new partner.

81
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:38,530
I asked that the body
be sent to D.C.

82
00:08:38,598 --> 00:08:40,395
It was found
in the woods

83
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:42,491
about 50 yards
beyond the house.

84
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:44,434
Maybe we should
begin there.

85
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:48,065
Let's begin
inside the house.

86
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:50,336
Okay, then.

87
00:08:57,984 --> 00:09:00,179
The deceased is
Arlen Sacks, aged 72

88
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:01,845
caretaker for the estate

89
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:03,912
on which this house
is situated.

90
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,288
There were no signs
of physical trauma

91
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:07,826
but local PD
suspect homicide

92
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:09,294
due to the dumping
of the body.

93
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:11,887
Mr. Sacks was confiined
to a wheelchair

94
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:13,159
the last few months

95
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:15,531
cared for since then
by his son, Gary

96
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:17,297
who's their
chief suspect.

97
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,962
Why?

98
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:22,997
Um... oh, because
he's missing, too.

99
00:09:23,076 --> 00:09:26,068
If he killed this man
without leaving a mark

100
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:28,010
that would suggest premeditation

101
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:29,947
an attempt
to disguise the murder.

102
00:09:30,016 --> 00:09:33,144
But that doesn't fiit with
dumping the body in the woods

103
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:34,311
or fleeing the scene

104
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:36,355
both of which
indicate panic, haste.

105
00:09:38,157 --> 00:09:39,522
That is great.

106
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:43,028
What was that last part again,
about the premeditation?

107
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:47,196
What is that?

108
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:49,360
Slime?

109
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:53,337
There's a small streak of it
on the floor over there, too.

110
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:57,308
So, it's not someone;
it's something.

111
00:09:57,377 --> 00:10:01,905
God, this really is an X-File,
isn't it?

112
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,084
Congratulations.

113
00:10:13,293 --> 00:10:15,488
I gave the slime
to the Buffalo PD.

114
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:18,291
I told them we wanted to see
the results right away.

115
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:21,300
How much fiield experience
you have, Agent Harrison?

116
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:25,361
Um, actually, this is
my fiirst time in the fiield.

117
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:26,530
Let me guess--

118
00:10:26,606 --> 00:10:29,131
Deputy Director Kersh
handed you this job

119
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,176
fiilling in for Agent Scully.

120
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:33,212
Yes. Yes, he did.

121
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,713
I don't know how to tell
you this, Agent Harrison

122
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:37,246
but you're being used.

123
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:39,615
Deputy Director Kersh is
no friend to the X-Files.

124
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:42,678
I don't think you understand
something, Agent Doggett.

125
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:44,587
I begged for this assignment.

126
00:10:44,657 --> 00:10:46,352
You begged for it.

127
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:48,394
I was in Accounting.

128
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:51,522
I processed Agents Mulder
and Scully's travel expenses.

129
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:54,293
Then you are qualifiied.

130
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:56,562
Maybe I'm not

131
00:10:56,636 --> 00:11:00,595
but I know the X-Files,
Agent Doggett, inside and out.

132
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,666
Other people don't even want
to admit these questions exist

133
00:11:03,743 --> 00:11:05,267
but you face them every day.

134
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:08,974
I am just so excited
to be a part of this.

135
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:10,447
Aren't you?

136
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:28,062
Mr. Sack's body was found here

137
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:30,625
but they found no
footprints leading to it.

138
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:34,331
Oh, my God.

139
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:35,738
There's more of it.

140
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:37,737
Looks like it.

141
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:39,444
You know what
that could be?

142
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:40,479
It could be bile.

143
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:45,611
Bile?

144
00:11:45,685 --> 00:11:47,175
From a liver-eating mutant.

145
00:11:47,253 --> 00:11:48,720
Mulder and Scully
chased one

146
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:50,085
into an escalator once.

147
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:51,646
It died, but,
but there was--

148
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:54,522
This is not a liver-eating
mutant, Agent Harrison.

149
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:57,188
It could be an alien
who shed its skin.

150
00:11:57,263 --> 00:11:59,493
According to Agent
Mulder's case reports

151
00:11:59,565 --> 00:12:00,554
they leave behind

152
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:02,692
a mucous-like residue
when they, uh--

153
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:08,667
You don't think
it's that either.

154
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:10,800
I'll take a
sample of this.

155
00:12:11,044 --> 00:12:13,535
Have it sent to the
lab for comparison.

156
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:15,547
That's good thinking,
Agent Harrison.

157
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,381
( rumbling )

158
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:44,309
( knocking )

159
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:45,309
Hey.

160
00:12:45,378 --> 00:12:46,470
Ready to roll?

161
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:48,104
Yeah. I'lljust get my keys.

162
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,215
Hey. Don't forget this.

163
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:53,377
Relax the back.

164
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:54,715
Breathe in, breathe out.

165
00:12:54,787 --> 00:12:56,186
( forceful panting )

166
00:12:56,255 --> 00:12:58,655
How do you know all
these things, Mulder?

167
00:12:58,691 --> 00:13:00,090
I'm unemployed.

168
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:02,753
I got a lot of time on my hands.

169
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:04,091
Oprah.

170
00:13:04,163 --> 00:13:06,063
I watch a lot of Oprah.

171
00:13:06,132 --> 00:13:09,863
Thank you for doing
this with me.

172
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:12,060
What's the matter?

173
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:16,503
I don't know. I, uh--

174
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:20,378
Maybe it's hormones or--

175
00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:24,474
This is just--

176
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,519
I'm just feeling so
strange about all this.

177
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:30,715
This having a baby, this?

178
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,758
No... no.

179
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:37,195
Leaving work, I guess.

180
00:13:37,263 --> 00:13:41,131
I mean, I... I walked
out of that offiice today

181
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,191
feeling like a deserter.

182
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:45,737
You've paid your
dues there, Scully.

183
00:13:45,805 --> 00:13:47,363
More than paid them.

184
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:52,372
You're concerned about
Agent Doggett.

185
00:13:57,183 --> 00:14:00,311
You know the entire time
that I was down there

186
00:14:00,386 --> 00:14:02,445
I had someone
to watch my back.

187
00:14:02,522 --> 00:14:06,424
I'm betting thatAgent Doggett
can take care of himself.

188
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:08,119
He's a big boy.

189
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:11,728
You've got to worry
about the little boy

190
00:14:11,797 --> 00:14:13,788
or little girl.

191
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:16,130
Boy?

192
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:17,533
Or girl?

193
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:23,788
Whoa.

194
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:29,558
Agent Harrison,
what are you doing here?

195
00:16:29,635 --> 00:16:31,535
I followed the tr--

196
00:16:32,872 --> 00:16:35,864
It's here.

197
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:37,306
It?

198
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:39,367
What ""it''?

199
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:41,310
You're armed, right?

200
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,952
What do you want
me to do?

201
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:57,423
I want you to go outside

202
00:16:57,496 --> 00:17:00,397
and I want you to stand
by the front door.

203
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:04,960
Whatever it is, I'm going
to try and flush it out.

204
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:10,340
Agent Harrison.

205
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:13,972
Take the safety off.

206
00:17:35,468 --> 00:17:37,402
( soft rattling )

207
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:53,517
( gunshots )

208
00:17:58,891 --> 00:17:59,983
Harrison.

209
00:18:02,528 --> 00:18:03,722
Agent Harrison!

210
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:38,096
( creaking )

211
00:19:04,957 --> 00:19:07,221
( telephone ringing )

212
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,222
Skinner.

213
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:09,223
Is it true?

214
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:10,224
Agent Scully.

215
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,691
I can't reach Agent Doggett

216
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:13,664
and someone told me
he's gone missing.

217
00:19:13,732 --> 00:19:14,858
He was investigating a murder.

218
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:15,901
He hasn't reported back.

219
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:17,697
Why wasn't I told?

220
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:18,896
Agent Scully, don't worry.

221
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:20,802
I'm heading
into the Bureau right now.

222
00:19:20,873 --> 00:19:21,805
No, you're not.

223
00:19:21,874 --> 00:19:23,239
Sir, are you ordering me

224
00:19:23,476 --> 00:19:25,603
not to go looking
for Agent Doggett?

225
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:29,239
I've got every available
law-enforcement offiicer out here.

226
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:31,074
You're on maternity leave now.

227
00:19:31,116 --> 00:19:34,552
Just trust that we're doing
everything that we know to do.

228
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,144
I know that you are...

229
00:19:36,222 --> 00:19:39,623
but what if it's not enough?

230
00:21:30,002 --> 00:21:31,731
- I'lljust take this to the lab.
- Thank you.

231
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:36,207
Seems like old times.

232
00:21:36,241 --> 00:21:39,267
You in scrubs,
slicing and dicing.

233
00:21:39,345 --> 00:21:41,711
What are you doing here, Mulder?

234
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,113
Actually I-I wandered
away from my tour.

235
00:21:47,753 --> 00:21:50,051
A better question is,
what are you doing here?

236
00:21:51,223 --> 00:21:53,157
I found something
that may prove helpful

237
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:54,658
in locating Agent Doggett.

238
00:21:54,727 --> 00:21:56,058
This is Arlen Sacks

239
00:21:56,095 --> 00:21:59,394
the murder victim
Doggett was investigating.

240
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:01,691
This old man was not
murdered, Mulder.

241
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:04,895
He died of heart failure,
evidently after he was blinded

242
00:22:04,937 --> 00:22:06,928
by a chemical substance
of some kind.

243
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:09,406
The orbits have...

244
00:22:09,642 --> 00:22:13,976
residual traces
of a slimy substance...

245
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:17,709
known as hydrolytic enzymes.

246
00:22:17,783 --> 00:22:18,306
Venom. Produced by reptiles.

247
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:19,373
How'd you know that?

248
00:22:19,618 --> 00:22:21,279
Before Agent Doggett
and his partner

249
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,118
went missing, they sent
in samples to be analyzed.

250
00:22:24,156 --> 00:22:26,147
Hydrolytic enzymes.
Skinner told me.

251
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:29,683
I, uh, also found some bacteria
in the venom

252
00:22:29,762 --> 00:22:32,322
which I'm going to do
a culture on.

253
00:22:32,398 --> 00:22:33,865
Let somebody else do it.

254
00:22:35,934 --> 00:22:38,129
There are other
concerns right now.

255
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:41,339
I know, but this is
an X-File, Mulder

256
00:22:41,407 --> 00:22:44,672
and you are out of the Bureau,
and now if I go home

257
00:22:44,743 --> 00:22:48,907
where is Skinner going to fiind
someone qualifiied to look into this?

258
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:51,814
I know where he
could fiind somebody.

259
00:22:54,053 --> 00:22:55,850
( clattering )

260
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:12,334
( raspy crunching )

261
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,778
( chittering sound)

262
00:24:15,234 --> 00:24:17,759
( gate opens )

263
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:19,428
Agent Doggett?

264
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:20,529
I'm right here.

265
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:25,739
Are you all right?

266
00:24:25,811 --> 00:24:28,006
It sprayed my eyes
with something.

267
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,173
My vision's all blurry.

268
00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:31,841
Makes two of us.

269
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:34,750
Three, actually.

270
00:24:52,171 --> 00:24:56,164
HARRISON: I think it's Gary Sacks,
the son of the murder victim.

271
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:58,004
How'd you get down here?

272
00:24:58,076 --> 00:25:00,476
I think it dragged me down here.
I'm not sure.

273
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:04,246
So what do
we do now?

274
00:25:04,316 --> 00:25:06,910
I don't know.

275
00:25:06,985 --> 00:25:11,251
Mulder and Scully investigated
a case once in Florida.

276
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:13,314
It involved subterranean men

277
00:25:13,392 --> 00:25:15,087
who took people underground.

278
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,593
This is not a man.

279
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:19,195
I fell through
some kind of trap.

280
00:25:19,264 --> 00:25:21,027
I'm guessing
somebody put that there

281
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:22,930
to provide live meals
for this thing.

282
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:25,333
You're not saying
that includes us?

283
00:25:25,404 --> 00:25:28,840
I don't intend to wait around
and fiind out.

284
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:30,499
These tunnels were built
by bootleggers

285
00:25:30,576 --> 00:25:31,975
back in Prohibition.

286
00:25:32,044 --> 00:25:35,343
There's got to be one
that leads back to the house.

287
00:25:35,414 --> 00:25:37,245
Something up there,
I think.

288
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:39,842
Some kind of light.

289
00:25:42,187 --> 00:25:45,384
I can't tell how high
up that is.

290
00:26:01,106 --> 00:26:03,540
Mulder, you're not supposed
to be out here.

291
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:05,133
I'm not out here.

292
00:26:05,177 --> 00:26:07,441
What happened
to the search?

293
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:09,379
Police in West Seneca
found Doggett's car

294
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:12,212
parked at a convenience store
about a half hour from here.

295
00:26:12,284 --> 00:26:14,013
How'd it get there?

296
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:17,852
I don't know, but we're
redirecting our search.

297
00:26:24,062 --> 00:26:25,222
Where are you going?

298
00:26:25,297 --> 00:26:26,992
I think I'll take
a walk in the woods.

299
00:26:27,032 --> 00:26:28,499
We've already had
40 people looking

300
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:29,591
around out
there, Mulder.

301
00:26:29,668 --> 00:26:30,600
What the hell?

302
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:32,237
I'm out of a job
already, right?

303
00:26:32,237 --> 00:26:33,226
I'm out of a job
already, right?

304
00:26:33,338 --> 00:26:33,895
( grunting )

305
00:27:03,702 --> 00:27:06,193
( grunting )

306
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,022
( grunting )

307
00:27:42,607 --> 00:27:44,734
( metallic clinking )

308
00:27:47,245 --> 00:27:49,611
MAN:
Thought all you people left.

309
00:27:52,517 --> 00:27:55,213
You are?

310
00:27:55,287 --> 00:27:57,585
Herman Stites.
I own this property.

311
00:27:57,656 --> 00:28:01,956
You're just the man I wanted
to speak to, Mr. Stites.

312
00:28:01,994 --> 00:28:04,292
Have you seen anything
unusual around here?

313
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:06,627
Unusual? How?

314
00:28:06,665 --> 00:28:10,624
Dangerous animals...

315
00:28:10,702 --> 00:28:11,964
reptiles.

316
00:28:12,004 --> 00:28:13,130
I'm confused.

317
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:15,071
I thought the police
were looking for a man.

318
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,074
Arlen's son, Gary.

319
00:28:17,142 --> 00:28:19,474
That is what
they're looking for.

320
00:28:30,756 --> 00:28:32,519
Agent Doggett?

321
00:28:32,557 --> 00:28:33,785
I'm all right.

322
00:28:40,499 --> 00:28:42,490
MULDER:
I don't think Gary Sacks committed

323
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:43,727
this murder, Mr. Stites.

324
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:45,292
I think he may be
a victim himself.

325
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:49,033
I didn't catch
your name, Agent.

326
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:53,635
Kersh, Alvin Kersh.

327
00:28:53,712 --> 00:28:56,203
I'm a scientist,
Mr. Kersh.

328
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:57,805
What kind of a scientist
are you?

329
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:58,812
A biologist

330
00:28:59,051 --> 00:29:00,575
so I know something
about animals.

331
00:29:00,652 --> 00:29:03,815
They don't generally
carry men off into the woods

332
00:29:04,056 --> 00:29:05,250
like poor Mr. Sacks.

333
00:29:05,323 --> 00:29:08,656
I don't think this was
an animal.

334
00:29:08,727 --> 00:29:10,160
I think it was a man

335
00:29:10,228 --> 00:29:13,595
using some kind of reptile venom
to blind them fiirst.

336
00:29:13,665 --> 00:29:15,565
That would be
quite a trick.

337
00:29:15,634 --> 00:29:18,068
You'd really have
to know what you were doing.

338
00:29:18,136 --> 00:29:21,299
You'd have to be,
say, a scientist.

339
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:24,467
Are you accusing me
of something, Mr. Kersh?

340
00:29:24,543 --> 00:29:30,504
No. I'm just thinking
out loud, Mr. Stites.

341
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:44,619
( grunting )

342
00:30:03,215 --> 00:30:05,274
I need a hand.

343
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,204
Agent Doggett, what happened?

344
00:30:28,273 --> 00:30:30,537
I lost my grip

345
00:30:30,609 --> 00:30:33,442
with a little help
from the man upstairs.

346
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:34,467
( distant clang )

347
00:30:37,315 --> 00:30:38,304
Hey!

348
00:30:40,152 --> 00:30:41,176
Hey!

349
00:30:41,253 --> 00:30:43,244
Hey!

350
00:30:43,321 --> 00:30:44,253
I'm a federal agent!

351
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,761
I don't understand.

352
00:30:53,832 --> 00:30:57,598
Why would he want
to keep us down here?

353
00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:00,934
You wanted to face the unknown,
Agent Harrison.

354
00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:02,936
Well, you're facing it now.

355
00:31:03,175 --> 00:31:05,575
But who is he?

356
00:31:05,644 --> 00:31:08,477
Some kind of scientist,
I think.

357
00:31:08,547 --> 00:31:11,607
I saw some books
and papers on biology

358
00:31:11,683 --> 00:31:12,945
in his library.

359
00:31:13,185 --> 00:31:17,281
It could be some kind
of symbiotic relationship

360
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:19,653
between this man
and this creature.

361
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:20,748
Mulder and Scully--

362
00:31:20,825 --> 00:31:21,849
Mulder and Scully

363
00:31:21,927 --> 00:31:24,191
aren't here, Agent Harrison,
we are.

364
00:31:24,262 --> 00:31:28,392
And wild speculation isn't going
to help us fiind a way out.

365
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:32,392
You think I'm pretty foolish,
don't you?

366
00:31:34,773 --> 00:31:38,607
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
but you want to take leaps

367
00:31:38,677 --> 00:31:41,168
that aren't supported
by the facts.

368
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:45,307
What I want
you to do is

369
00:31:45,383 --> 00:31:47,180
stay with that guy right there

370
00:31:47,252 --> 00:31:48,981
while I look
for another way out.

371
00:31:49,221 --> 00:31:51,246
If this thing
comes near you...

372
00:31:51,323 --> 00:31:54,417
I want you to shoot.

373
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,494
Agent Doggett.

374
00:32:10,008 --> 00:32:11,532
He's gone.

375
00:32:12,944 --> 00:32:14,741
What do you mean he's gone?

376
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:17,739
I don't know.

377
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:19,716
It must have taken him.

378
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:37,225
( phone ringing )

379
00:32:40,372 --> 00:32:41,339
Mulder.

380
00:32:41,406 --> 00:32:42,668
Mulder, what are you doing?

381
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:45,369
I'm spitting sunflower shells
on Herman Stites's driveway.

382
00:32:45,443 --> 00:32:46,774
What are you doing, Scully?

383
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:49,439
I just got off
the phone with Skinner

384
00:32:49,514 --> 00:32:50,674
who is furious.

385
00:32:50,749 --> 00:32:52,478
This man Stites just called him
saying that

386
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,814
you've been impersonating
Deputy Director Kersh

387
00:32:54,886 --> 00:32:56,820
and making baseless accusations.

388
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:58,014
What's he mad about

389
00:32:58,256 --> 00:33:00,918
me impersonating Kersh
or me harassing Stites?

390
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:03,961
Mulder, the victim had
reptile venom in his eyes.

391
00:33:03,995 --> 00:33:05,257
Are you now saying

392
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,423
that it was a man who did this?

393
00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:08,932
What are you saying it is,
Scully?

394
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,865
I know this may be hard
to believe

395
00:33:10,935 --> 00:33:11,993
coming from me

396
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,004
but some kind
of reptile attack is

397
00:33:14,072 --> 00:33:18,008
the only explanation consistent
with the scientifiic evidence.

398
00:33:18,076 --> 00:33:20,544
I don't think it's a monster
that we're dealing with here.

399
00:33:20,612 --> 00:33:21,636
I think it is a man.

400
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,942
And why do you say that?

401
00:33:23,014 --> 00:33:24,481
You regifted.

402
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:25,881
I'm sorry?

403
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,941
My Apollo medallion.

404
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:30,078
You found it?

405
00:33:30,322 --> 00:33:33,450
Yeah. I found it on the grass
on Stites's estate.

406
00:33:33,525 --> 00:33:35,891
Doggett must be
around here somewhere.

407
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:37,895
( door opens )

408
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:39,362
Agent Scully?

409
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:40,659
I got to go.

410
00:33:46,838 --> 00:33:48,305
What am I looking at?

411
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:49,601
As you asked

412
00:33:49,674 --> 00:33:52,643
we cultured the bacteria
from the hydrolytic enzymes

413
00:33:52,711 --> 00:33:55,373
that were sprayed
into the old man's eyes.

414
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:57,039
Looks like they're
breaking down the tissue.

415
00:33:57,115 --> 00:33:58,605
That's exactly
what they're doing.

416
00:33:58,683 --> 00:34:01,481
The venom blinds its victim,
then the bacteria excretes

417
00:34:01,553 --> 00:34:04,454
protease and collagenase
throughout the victim's body.

418
00:34:04,522 --> 00:34:05,955
Digestive enzymes.

419
00:34:06,024 --> 00:34:09,721
Muscle, bone,
all of it is slowly liquefiied

420
00:34:09,794 --> 00:34:11,022
for easy digestion

421
00:34:11,096 --> 00:34:14,395
while the victim's skin
is made hard and brittle

422
00:34:14,466 --> 00:34:15,899
forming a sack or shell

423
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:17,867
from which the
reptile can drink.

424
00:34:17,936 --> 00:34:19,801
So the reptile sprays
its victim

425
00:34:19,871 --> 00:34:21,862
and then all it has
to do is wait.

426
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,738
There are precedents
for this sort of thing in nature.

427
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:30,805
Yeah, but there are no species
that can do all of this.

428
00:34:30,882 --> 00:34:32,509
At least not yet.

429
00:34:32,584 --> 00:34:34,518
What do you mean?

430
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:49,127
Talk about the blind
leading the blind.

431
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:52,393
I owe you an apology,
Agent Doggett.

432
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,563
You're doing fiine,
Agent Harrison.

433
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,867
Hang tough.

434
00:34:55,907 --> 00:34:57,033
You were right.

435
00:34:57,108 --> 00:34:58,666
I'm not qualifiied.

436
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:05,447
We're going to fiind a way
out of here, Agent Harrison.

437
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:07,178
I don't think I am.

438
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:13,584
Why, what is it?

439
00:35:13,658 --> 00:35:15,592
Whatever happened to Sacks--

440
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,628
I think it's happening to me.

441
00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:19,789
I'm completely blind now.

442
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:24,000
( moist, squishy noises )

443
00:35:29,774 --> 00:35:32,709
( gunshots )

444
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:43,984
Oh, God,
Agent Doggett!

445
00:35:50,695 --> 00:35:53,163
I think it's Gary Sacks.

446
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:03,562
( ringing )

447
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:04,835
Mulder.

448
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:08,039
You were right
about Herman Stites, Mulder.

449
00:36:08,112 --> 00:36:09,636
What'd you fiind?

450
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:11,875
Stites is a crypto-biologist

451
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:13,884
specializing
in reptile genetics.

452
00:36:13,918 --> 00:36:15,442
Listen to this:

453
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,080
It says here that he published
a monograph last year

454
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:19,680
claiming to be on the verge

455
00:36:19,757 --> 00:36:22,726
of creating
a new species of reptile.

456
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:24,489
You don't think
he succeeded, do you?

457
00:36:24,562 --> 00:36:25,790
I don't know.

458
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:28,094
He dropped out of sight
and never published a follow-up.

459
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:32,466
But, Mulder,
the bacteria inside this venom--

460
00:36:32,537 --> 00:36:35,267
if Stites is genetically
altering reptile breeds

461
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:38,499
it may explain
the peculiar properties.

462
00:36:41,513 --> 00:36:43,606
Mulder, are you listening to me?

463
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:47,616
Mulder?

464
00:36:49,587 --> 00:36:51,714
Mulder?

465
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:55,156
I think Mr. Stites might have
a lot more than that to explain.

466
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:03,130
Mulder? Mulder?

467
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:38,333
Mr. Stites!

468
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,128
Mr. Stites, open up!

469
00:37:40,204 --> 00:37:42,764
Mr. Stites,
open the door!

470
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,241
( pounding )

471
00:37:46,311 --> 00:37:47,903
Mr. Stites!

472
00:38:05,997 --> 00:38:07,897
Mr. Stites!

473
00:38:13,671 --> 00:38:15,138
( pounding continues )

474
00:38:18,743 --> 00:38:19,937
Mr. Stites!

475
00:38:26,351 --> 00:38:27,875
( dialing )

476
00:38:30,622 --> 00:38:31,589
What do you want?

477
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:37,091
Where is it,
Mr. Stites?

478
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:38,958
This thing
you're protecting--

479
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,361
this creature of yours?

480
00:38:40,598 --> 00:38:42,065
I don't think
you meant for it to

481
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:43,327
but it got out last night

482
00:38:43,401 --> 00:38:45,266
and attacked
the caretaker and his son

483
00:38:45,303 --> 00:38:47,100
and then
it attacked my colleagues.

484
00:38:48,906 --> 00:38:50,601
Now, I can have
50 men in here

485
00:38:50,642 --> 00:38:52,610
to comb this place
within the hour.

486
00:38:54,312 --> 00:38:57,110
Where are they, Mr. Stites?

487
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,242
( gasps )

488
00:39:00,318 --> 00:39:02,013
It's all right.

489
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:03,644
It's just me.

490
00:39:06,024 --> 00:39:08,117
Doesn't make any damn sense.

491
00:39:08,192 --> 00:39:10,820
There's no exit
except that door.

492
00:39:10,895 --> 00:39:12,920
Maybe it does.

493
00:39:12,997 --> 00:39:14,123
( pounding )

494
00:39:14,198 --> 00:39:15,392
MULDER:
Agent Doggett?

495
00:39:15,633 --> 00:39:16,827
Right here!

496
00:39:20,071 --> 00:39:21,265
It's all right,
Agent Doggett.

497
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:22,863
We're going to
get you out of here.

498
00:39:23,975 --> 00:39:25,067
Who's that with you?

499
00:39:25,143 --> 00:39:27,008
It's the man
that lives here.

500
00:39:27,045 --> 00:39:28,774
He's been protecting this thing.

501
00:39:28,846 --> 00:39:30,040
He's kept us down here.

502
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:31,412
- Agent Doggett, I know--
- It's him.

503
00:39:31,649 --> 00:39:34,209
He's not protecting it.

504
00:39:34,285 --> 00:39:36,651
He is it.

505
00:39:47,098 --> 00:39:48,656
Agent Mulder?

506
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:02,246
Agent Doggett,
I don't have a weapon.

507
00:40:02,313 --> 00:40:03,780
I'm coming to get yours.

508
00:40:07,151 --> 00:40:09,176
No, I'm not.

509
00:40:09,253 --> 00:40:11,221
Mulder, I can't see.

510
00:40:12,757 --> 00:40:13,781
Mulder, where is it?

511
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:15,223
It's right above you.

512
00:40:19,464 --> 00:40:20,488
It's coming this way.

513
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,333
Where, Mulder? I can't see!

514
00:40:24,402 --> 00:40:25,232
Aim down.

515
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:29,131
Aim at the sound of my voice.

516
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:30,196
No, I'll shoot you!

517
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:31,071
You're not going to shoot me.

518
00:40:31,142 --> 00:40:31,801
I can't see!

519
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:32,968
Aim at the sound of my voice.

520
00:40:33,044 --> 00:40:34,011
Where is it?

521
00:40:34,045 --> 00:40:35,740
Aim at me!

522
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:36,507
Fire when I tell you to fiire.

523
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:36,975
No!

524
00:40:37,048 --> 00:40:38,015
Fire!

525
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:38,413
( gunfiire )

526
00:40:42,987 --> 00:40:44,921
Agent Mulder?

527
00:40:46,724 --> 00:40:48,487
Agent Mulder?

528
00:40:51,262 --> 00:40:53,787
I'm right here.

529
00:40:53,865 --> 00:40:56,425
I'm right here,
Agent Doggett.

530
00:41:37,241 --> 00:41:38,538
SCULLY:
Agent Doggett?

531
00:41:40,244 --> 00:41:41,438
Is this it?

532
00:41:41,512 --> 00:41:44,140
- No.
- No.

533
00:41:44,215 --> 00:41:45,580
We just came by

534
00:41:45,817 --> 00:41:47,182
to visit
Agent Harrison.

535
00:41:47,218 --> 00:41:48,776
How is she?

536
00:41:48,853 --> 00:41:52,050
She's on the same
antivenin treatment I got.

537
00:41:52,123 --> 00:41:53,988
Her eyesight's
pretty much back.

538
00:41:54,058 --> 00:41:56,322
Doctors say she's going
to be fiine, physically.

539
00:41:56,394 --> 00:41:59,329
Skinner said she won't
be returning to the X-Files.

540
00:41:59,397 --> 00:42:00,864
That was her choice.

541
00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:03,196
Just going to be
me for a while.

542
00:42:07,138 --> 00:42:10,073
I want to return something
to you

543
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:13,099
that I think you deserve
to keep.

544
00:42:13,144 --> 00:42:14,611
I appreciate the gesture

545
00:42:14,846 --> 00:42:16,837
but if it's all
the same to you

546
00:42:16,914 --> 00:42:20,406
there's someone else
who should have it.

547
00:42:23,287 --> 00:42:24,276
No way.

548
00:42:27,024 --> 00:42:28,252
This means--

549
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:32,388
I can't tell you
what this means to me.

550
00:42:38,336 --> 00:42:40,201
Can I ask you something?

551
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:43,936
Sure.

552
00:42:44,008 --> 00:42:47,535
When you went to Antarctica

553
00:42:47,612 --> 00:42:51,946
to save Agent Scully from
being taken by that spaceship

554
00:42:52,016 --> 00:42:55,076
and you ran out of gas
in your Snow-Cat--

555
00:42:55,152 --> 00:42:56,642
how did you get back?

556
00:42:58,923 --> 00:43:01,949
Um, well, fiirst of all

557
00:43:02,026 --> 00:43:05,189
it was never actually proven
that it was a spaceship.

558
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:06,287
It wasn't?

559
00:43:06,364 --> 00:43:10,994
No, what happened was that

560
00:43:11,068 --> 00:43:14,868
we fell off of something
that rose out of the ice.

561
00:43:14,906 --> 00:43:16,897
And what do you
think that was?

562
00:43:16,974 --> 00:43:18,202
Well, I don't know
what it was

563
00:43:18,276 --> 00:43:20,141
but we didn't actually
see a spaceship.

564
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:22,145
I can't believe you're saying
it's not a spaceship.

565
00:43:22,213 --> 00:43:23,373
It could have
been a spaceship.

566
00:43:23,414 --> 00:43:24,540
Of course it
was a spaceship.

567
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:26,048
We don't know that it--

568
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:27,641
But you don't have
a picture of it or anything.

569
00:43:27,885 --> 00:43:29,352
You know it was a spaceship.
You saw it.

570
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,251
No, no, remember,
I was unconscious.

571
00:43:31,289 --> 00:43:32,256
And when I woke up

572
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:33,348
there was no spaceship.

573
00:43:33,424 --> 00:43:36,393
Mulder, no, no, no.

574
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,052
And you were frozen.

575
00:43:38,129 --> 00:43:40,063
And remember,
I hugged you

576
00:43:40,131 --> 00:43:42,099
until you were not
frozen anymore--
