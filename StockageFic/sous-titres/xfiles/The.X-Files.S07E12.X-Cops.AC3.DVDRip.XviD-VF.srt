00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:12,842
Bad boys

What you gonna do

3
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:18,183

00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,390
What you gonna do

00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,155

00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:32,392
Bad boys, bad boys

00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:34,797
What you gonna do

9
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:38,531
Bad boys, bad boys
What you gonna do

10
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:41,130
What you gonna do
when they come for you

11
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,607
Nobody na

12
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:45,473
Police na

13
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,140
That old soldier man

14
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,809
Not even your idren

15

Bad boys, bad boys

What you gonna do
when they come for you

17

Bad boys, bad boys
What you gonna do

18
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,421
What you gonna do
when they come for you

19
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,657
Cops is filmed on location...

20
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,893
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

21
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:11,903
All suspects are innocent until
proven guilty in a court of law.

22
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,674
Yeah, I don't know
what it is about a full moon.

23
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:19,303
It's just, uh... There's something
about it. People just go off the wall.

24
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,246
These are some pretty scary
neighborhoods to begin with.

25
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:24,374
I haven't been on the job
that long myself,

26
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:28,888
but I've seen more than
my fair share of crazy stuff.

27
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,788
When the moon is full,
it's just like times ten.

28
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,255
I don't know, uh...
I don't know.

29
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,729
Maybe it's the tides
or something.

30
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,060
But irregardless,
we're on the job.

31
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:47,903
And if that makes people breathe a
little easier knowing we're out there...

32
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:50,966
or being a little less nervous
walking the streets at night,

33
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,979
well, that's a good feeling.

34
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,650
Okay.

35
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,484
We got a report of somebody lurking
around the neighborhood making noise.

36
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,786
Actually, I take that back.
We got a report of a...

37
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,919
a monster lurking around
the neighborhood.

38
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,793
What...
Hey, it's a full moon.

39
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,905
A lot of drug activity
in this district.

40
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,271
We're probably looking at
somebody rattlin' doorknobs...

41
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,276
trying to steal some money
for a quick fix.

42
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,278
Usually, they're not
the stealthiest of criminals,

43
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,315
so maybe
we'll get lucky,

44
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,316
sneak up on 'em.

45
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:39,050
212-Adam is 10-97.

46
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,889
212-Adam is 10-97 at 543 Vogel.

47
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,800
212-Adam to Dispatch.
I don't see anything.

48
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,201
Can you let the lady know
inside her house... know I'm out here?

49
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,466
212-Adam, copy your request.
Calling now.

50
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,735
- Figures, doesn't it? Psst!

51
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,056
A lot of scratches.

52
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,319
Maybe a big dog's
probably what she saw.

53
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,491
Sheriff s Department!

54
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,833
Uh...

55
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,410
- Senora?

56
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,479
Man, she's scared of somethin'.

57
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,000
- Hey, you, there!

58
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,968
You, freeze!
Sheriff s Department!

59
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,469
Freeze!
Sheriff s Department!

60
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,783
Run! Run to the car!
Back to the car, now!

61
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,690
Now! Run!

62
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,456
Run,
Run!

63
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,997
- Now! Now! Come on!
Get up! Go, go, go!

64
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,660
Back to the car!
Come on! Run!

65
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,896
Run!

66
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,098
Get in the car!
Get in the car!

67
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,834
Holy
Come on!

68
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,340
- 10-33! 10-33!
Patrol Adam needs assistance!

69
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:19,476
I need assistance at the 500 block
of Vogel! I need assistance!

70
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:23,386
I need...
9-9-9! 9-9-9!

71
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:12,565
Everybody all right?

72
00:06:13,805 --> 00:06:16,797
Hey, you all right?
You all right?

73
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,900
Keith.
What was this?

74
00:06:18,977 --> 00:06:22,845
I was responding to a 9-21
at this house right here, and, uh...

75
00:06:22,914 --> 00:06:24,905
- It was a prowler call.
- You flipped it?

76
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:27,247
No, no. Hell, no, I didn't...
I didn't flip it.

77
00:06:27,318 --> 00:06:29,479
It was...
We were parked.

78
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:31,488
The...
We were attacked.

79
00:06:31,556 --> 00:06:33,524
- By who? By gangbangers?
- Uh...

80
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:38,358
- Keith?
- Yeah. Yeah, it was...
it was gangbangers.

81
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,261
Okay.
Fan out and search.

82
00:06:40,331 --> 00:06:42,492
Hey, you'd better double
everybody up.

83
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:44,660
Okay, hold on a minute.
Uh, everybody double up.

84
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:48,069
Set up a command post
and check on that air shift.

85
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:51,370
How many?
Keith? Keith?

86
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:55,539
Um, you know,
I didn't get a good look. Maybe...

87
00:06:55,613 --> 00:06:59,379
4-17 suspects
on foot just one block north of Holly.

88
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:03,387
Armed suspects! Bring some units
around side Holly Street!

89
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:28,875
Get your hands up! Get your hands up!

90
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:31,973
We're the F.B.I.!

91
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,679
- Turn around!
- I've got I.D. in my back pocket!

92
00:07:35,753 --> 00:07:37,812
- We're investigating a case!
- Hands behind your head!

93
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:39,823
- Check the I.D.!

94
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:42,587
Hands behind your head!

95
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,026
Check my I.D.
in the back pocket.

96
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,829
They're both F.B.I.
Give 'em back their guns.

97
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:54,303
- Thank you.
-  We're investigating a case.

98
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:57,170
- What case?
- Same case you're working on.

99
00:07:57,242 --> 00:08:00,177
- So who we looking for?
- Not "who." What.

100
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:04,009
- Mulder, what the hell is going on here?
- I don't know.

101
00:08:04,082 --> 00:08:05,617
- You okay? You all right?
-  See the claw marks here?

102
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:07,744
- You okay? You all right?
-  See the claw marks here?

103
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:09,753
Someone tried to get in.

104
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:21,858
Hey, Deputy? Deputy, can you describe
for me what you saw?

105
00:08:23,368 --> 00:08:25,336
Um... Well, I mean,
it's pretty dark,

106
00:08:25,403 --> 00:08:28,270
and I-I didn't really see.

107
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:30,432
- I don't know what... I don't know.
- You must've seen something...

108
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:32,738
in order to run away from it.

109
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:35,142
Huh? You were responding
to the same call we were...

110
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:37,147
of a monster
prowling the neighborhood.

111
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:40,548
We've been to this house before.
The lady has a history of medication.

112
00:08:40,618 --> 00:08:43,746
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, maybe. But she's not
the only one seeing monsters.

113
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:47,120
There's been half a dozen such sightings
in this area in the past 60 days.

114
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:49,126
Were you aware of that?

115
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:53,960
- No.
- Yeah.

116
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:56,330
Also, these sightings only occur
on nights when there's a full moon,

117
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:59,734
- Which tells me something.
-  What?

118
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:02,967
What you saw was large, right?
Maybe seven, eight feet tall...

119
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:06,408
when it stood up on its two legs,
and it was covered in fur...

120
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:09,071
and had glowing red eyes
and claws...

121
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:11,911
claws sharp enough to gouge
the wood off that front door.

122
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:16,249
- You're not serious?
- And dare I forget teeth?

123
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:19,813
It bit you, didn't it?
Yeah, look at that.

124
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:22,382
Deputy, how long were you gonna
hide that from the E.M.T. s?

125
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,394
- I don't...
- Where'd you get that, Keith?

126
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:27,090
I don't even know
where that came from.

127
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:29,759
I mean, I didn't see anything
that he's talking about.

128
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:33,303
Big teeth,
eight feet tall.

129
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:35,669
- What the hell are you describing?
- A werewolf.

130
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,198
- Excuse me?
- It's what did that.

131
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:42,974
It also attacked one Hymen Escallera
29 days ago during the last full moon.

132
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:45,140
Hymen died of his wounds
in Compton General Hospital,

133
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:48,185
but not before giving a detailed
description of what attacked him.

134
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:51,154
My partner and I
are here to catch it.

135
00:09:51,222 --> 00:09:53,884
Unfortunately, though, Deputy,
you've been bitten.

136
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,290
The skin is broken.

137
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:58,295
Werewolf law pretty much
universally holds that...

138
00:09:58,363 --> 00:10:01,855
someone who's been bitten
by such a creature is gonna
become such a creature himself.

139
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:04,800
- So...
- Wait a minute. I mean...

140
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:06,803
But see, that's not really
what happened, though.

141
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:10,068
I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to
be isolated and kept under guard.

142
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:12,871
With all due respect, what the
are you talkin'about?

143
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:17,506
I'm talking about preventing
this man from becoming a danger
to himself and to others.

144
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:20,915
- Can I see your badge again?
- Agent Mulder?

145
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:23,215
Can we have a word
a second?

146
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:26,917
Excuse me.
What is it?

147
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:30,620
What is it? Mulder, have you noticed
that we're on television?

148
00:10:30,695 --> 00:10:33,664
I don't think it's live television,
Scully. She just said

149
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:36,199
But it's a camera,
and it's recording.

150
00:10:36,267 --> 00:10:38,963
It's recording everything that you
are saying. Do you understand that?

151
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:41,005
I just wanna make sure
that you're clear on that.

152
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:43,006
Sure, I'm clear on that,
Scully.

153
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:45,941
My point being, Mulder,
that we are on a case.

154
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,002
Well, this presents an opportunity.
I feel we're very close here.

155
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,311
And the possibility of capturing
concrete proof of the paranormal...

156
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:55,546
of a werewolf in front
of a national audience,
even an international audience...

157
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,589
- What's not to love?
- Well...

158
00:10:58,656 --> 00:11:02,820
Look, Mulder, you wanna talk
about werewolves to me,
you can knock yourself out.

159
00:11:02,894 --> 00:11:05,419
I may not agree with you, but at least
I'm not gonna hold it against you.

160
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:08,932
But this... Mulder,
this could ruin your career.

161
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,059
What career?

162
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:13,535
Scully, I appreciate it.
You don't want me looking foolish.

163
00:11:13,604 --> 00:11:16,095
I do.
I appreciate that.

164
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:18,574
I don't want me
looking foolish, Mulder.

165
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:22,746
Okay, fine.
Well, do me a favor.

166
00:11:22,814 --> 00:11:24,748
Will you just escort
Deputy Wetzel to the hospital?

167
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:27,512
Just keep an eye on him
in case I'm right? Thank you.

168
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:32,012
- I'm gonna call Skinner, Mulder.
- Okay.

169
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,854
I'm sure he's gonna wanna say
a couple words about this.

170
00:11:37,628 --> 00:11:39,562
Guys, give it a rest,
huh?

171
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:03,977
She says, uh... I guess
she's calling it a claw monster...

172
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:06,681
was trying to break
into the house and get her.

173
00:12:06,756 --> 00:12:10,385
Uh, it was big and had claws
pretty much. Keeps going on and on.

174
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,951
Yeah, all right. Tell her to describe it
in detail to the sketch artist.

175
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:14,963
- Will you work with her? Yeah.
- Claw monster?

176
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:17,761
- Just do it, Ricky.
- Okay.

177
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:21,326
Hey, look at that.
Excuse me.

178
00:12:21,404 --> 00:12:24,862
Look at this.
It's like five claw marks.

179
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:28,775
Just like the human hand
has five fingers. Pretty much
the same spread too.

180
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:31,006
- Agent, you seriously believe...
- Huh?

181
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,014
we're lookin' for
some kind of a...

182
00:12:33,082 --> 00:12:35,141
I'll show you.

183
00:12:35,218 --> 00:12:37,379
This.

184
00:12:37,453 --> 00:12:39,648
This is what
Hymen Escallera described...

185
00:12:39,722 --> 00:12:42,190
just before succumbing
to his injuries.

186
00:12:42,258 --> 00:12:45,159
Ten to one, that's what
Mrs. Guerrero's gonna describe too.

187
00:12:48,164 --> 00:12:50,928
Sir? Sir?
We got your suspect.

188
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:56,396
Claw monster! Claw monster!

189
00:12:56,472 --> 00:12:58,770
Claw monster. Boy, you know,
they kill him in every movie,

190
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:01,901
and he just
keeps coming back.

191
00:13:01,978 --> 00:13:04,139
- Now, this is... this is strange.
- Mm-hmm.

192
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:07,705
Gracias, Mrs. Guerrero.
We're lookin' for gangbangers.

193
00:13:07,784 --> 00:13:11,083
Um, you don't think it's some guy
dressed up like Freddy Krueger, do you?

194
00:13:12,855 --> 00:13:15,847
Can somebody walk me to my car? It's
dark out, and I'm parked up the street.

195
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:17,984
Yeah, come on, Ricky.
I'll walk you to your car.

196
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,494
- Can I return this vest later?
- Yeah, you can return the vest later.

197
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:23,555
- This is what she was tellin'...
- That's what she's saying.
That's the claw monster.

198
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:27,196
You catch?

199
00:13:28,471 --> 00:13:30,939
- Catch-Catch him?
- Si. Si.

200
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,941
You catch.

201
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:52,125
How's Deputy Wetzel?

202
00:13:52,195 --> 00:13:55,187
- You let him get released?
- Well,

203
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:57,664
those weren't
teeth marks, Mulder.

204
00:13:57,733 --> 00:13:59,997
They turned out
to be insect bites.

205
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:03,129
Individual welts
or stings of some sort.

206
00:14:04,407 --> 00:14:07,137
Together, they just look like
a larger pattern,

207
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,371
especially when
we want them to.

208
00:14:11,347 --> 00:14:14,077
Although, it was
an understandable conclusion...

209
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,141
that I'm sure
anybody would have made.

210
00:14:18,221 --> 00:14:21,315
So what did
Skinner say?

211
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,882
He said that the F.B.I.
has nothing to hide,

212
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:26,895
and neither do we.

213
00:14:26,963 --> 00:14:28,988
If it makes you feel any better,
I'm not entirely convinced...

214
00:14:29,065 --> 00:14:31,226
that we're looking for
a werewolf anymore.

215
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,066
- Oh. All right. Good.
- Yeah, it's something else.

216
00:14:35,137 --> 00:14:37,970
I'm not sure what.
Some other kind of creature though.

217
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,974
- I have a... Hey, what's going on?

218
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:42,340
Six blocks from here.
Could be what we're looking for.

219
00:14:45,681 --> 00:14:47,808
No. You go
with someone else.

220
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:51,047
Man down at the corner of...

221
00:15:07,003 --> 00:15:08,937
Guys, watch out.
I'm a doctor.

222
00:15:11,607 --> 00:15:13,541
Oh, man, it's Ricky.

223
00:15:22,184 --> 00:15:24,118
That's what I was afraid of, Scully.

224
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:33,690
When a fellow officer
goes down in the line of duty,

225
00:15:33,761 --> 00:15:36,025
or even if it's...
even if it's not a fellow officer...

226
00:15:36,097 --> 00:15:38,657
if it's just somebody working
part-time with the department...

227
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:41,964
in a support, uh...

228
00:15:42,036 --> 00:15:45,267
artistic capacity...

229
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:48,536
like Ricky there...
we all feel it.

230
00:15:48,609 --> 00:15:52,443
Uh, that there is
every cop's worst nightmare.

231
00:15:52,513 --> 00:15:56,108
But that's when you gotta
cowboy up and give 150 percent...

232
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:58,118
and catch the bad guys.

233
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:01,946
Last call from his phone
was made to the Road Club.

234
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:06,153
Ricky called in requesting roadside
assistance for his flat tire.

235
00:16:06,227 --> 00:16:08,491
He asked them to hurry.
He said he didn't feel safe.

236
00:16:10,364 --> 00:16:13,595
- What's that?
- Our suspect, apparently.

237
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:16,831
- The slash marks match up pretty well,

238
00:16:16,904 --> 00:16:18,838
wouldn't you say?

239
00:16:25,947 --> 00:16:27,881
Somebody lost a nail.

240
00:16:30,017 --> 00:16:32,713
Nice color.

241
00:16:32,787 --> 00:16:35,278
Check out this color,
Mulder.

242
00:16:35,356 --> 00:16:37,290
Blood red.

243
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:41,521
Hey, uh, who called 911
on this?

244
00:16:41,596 --> 00:16:44,429
-  Steve and Edy?
Sergeant Paula.

245
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:47,764
The Steve and Edy?

246
00:16:47,835 --> 00:16:50,770
They're good folk. They usually call us
if there's trouble in the neighborhood.

247
00:16:53,274 --> 00:16:56,209
- Ooh.
- Oh, my God! Look at this!

248
00:16:56,277 --> 00:16:58,745
- Look at all these people. Lord!
- How are you doin' this evening?

249
00:16:58,813 --> 00:17:01,907
- We fine.
- Can y'all tell us
what happened out here?

250
00:17:01,983 --> 00:17:03,848
Not with me lookin'
like this. Mm-mmm.

251
00:17:03,918 --> 00:17:06,216
Now, you should know
better than that, Sergeant Paula!

252
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:09,882
Like she gonna run from a camera.
Look it here.

253
00:17:09,957 --> 00:17:14,121
We heard all this screamin',
peeked out the window,

254
00:17:14,195 --> 00:17:18,393
and this boy with crazy hair
was having a conniption fit...

255
00:17:18,466 --> 00:17:20,525
all rolled up there
by the phone.

256
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:23,229
You didn't see his...
his attacker?

257
00:17:23,304 --> 00:17:25,795
- Mmm.
- I'm ready for my close-up.

258
00:17:25,873 --> 00:17:28,205
Ain't nobody care about your scabby ass.
This is police business.

259
00:17:28,276 --> 00:17:31,268
- What?
- Now, I didn't see...

260
00:17:31,345 --> 00:17:33,438
- What'd you say? Attacker?
- Attacker.

261
00:17:33,514 --> 00:17:37,678
- No, he was just kind of
all rolled up and yellin'.
- Mm-hmm.

262
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:40,277
Did you see anything...

263
00:17:40,354 --> 00:17:42,288
that looked like this?

264
00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:45,120
- Ooh, stop!
- Or this?

265
00:17:45,193 --> 00:17:48,629
- Ooh! Excuse me?
- That's gonna give me nightmares.

266
00:17:48,696 --> 00:17:51,563
- So you didn't see anything at all?
- Uh-uh. No.

267
00:17:51,632 --> 00:17:53,793
Did you, uh...
Did you see a woman?

268
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:56,769
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

269
00:17:56,838 --> 00:17:59,864
- Chantara. I know that
skanky-ass color anywhere.
- Mm-hmm.

270
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:02,136
- Sure do.
- Chantara a streetwalker?

271
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,576
- Mm-hmm. She work the corner.
- Mm-hmm.

272
00:18:04,645 --> 00:18:06,636
- She on the pipe, so we don't associate.
- Oh, yeah.

273
00:18:06,714 --> 00:18:08,648
- Mm-mmm. No.
- You know what I'm sayin'?

274
00:18:08,716 --> 00:18:11,947
Well, we should go...
We should go talk to Chantara then.

275
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:14,249
- Well, I wish you would. Mm-hmm.
- That's right.

276
00:18:14,322 --> 00:18:17,689
Hey! Hey!
When I'm a-get my own TV show?

277
00:18:17,758 --> 00:18:20,886
- If I didn't care
- Oh, she's showin' off now.

278
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:23,453
- More than words can say
- Stop! Stop! Get in there! Stop this!

279
00:18:23,531 --> 00:18:25,590
- Would you excuse us? Excuse us.
- If I didn't care

280
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:29,193
Get in there! Stop this!
Bye, y'all. Bye.

281
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,329
So apparently,
we're on the lookout...

282
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:34,499
for someone whose hair
matches her fingernails.

283
00:18:34,575 --> 00:18:38,636
Bubblegum pink. That would be
a good color for you, Scully.

284
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,944
I'd have to say that at this point
in the investigation,

285
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,454
I'm-I'm usually
a little more secure...

286
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:50,956
in-in what it is
we're actually investigating.

287
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:54,188
But we've had so many conflicting
eyewitness reports...

288
00:18:54,262 --> 00:18:58,164
that it's hard to ascertain exactly
what it is we're looking for.

289
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:07,171
But the crimes we are investigating
are... are paranormal.

290
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:09,937
I can say that...

291
00:19:10,011 --> 00:19:12,912
with absolute conviction.

292
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,279
And the nature of these crimes,
they're-they're notoriously
hard to quantify...

293
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:20,650
in any kind of rigorous scientific
level, as Agent Scully will tell you.

294
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:24,521
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, which in its own way...

295
00:19:24,592 --> 00:19:29,188
is a kind of a validation, if
you think about it, in and of itself.

296
00:19:29,263 --> 00:19:33,165
But, you know, that's our job.
That's why they pay us the big bucks.

297
00:19:35,102 --> 00:19:37,036
Bubblegum pink.

298
00:19:40,408 --> 00:19:44,105
- Don't run! F.B.I.!
- Chantara Gomez?

299
00:19:44,178 --> 00:19:46,612
- Chantara...
- Chantara Gomez?

300
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,852
- Don't run! It's okay.

301
00:19:54,455 --> 00:19:57,151
- It's okay.

302
00:19:57,224 --> 00:20:00,819
- It's all right.
- Chantara Gomez?

303
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,420
- Can I see your hands, please?
- I didn't do nothing!

304
00:20:03,497 --> 00:20:06,091
- Can I see your hands, please?
It's okay.

305
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:08,533
- We need to see your hands.
- Show her your hands.

306
00:20:14,742 --> 00:20:18,542
Earlier this evening, a man
was attacked. He was badly slashed.

307
00:20:18,612 --> 00:20:21,513
And do you realize that
this places you at the crime scene?

308
00:20:21,582 --> 00:20:24,312
Fisher and Delmont. That's
your usual hang, isn't it, Chantara?

309
00:20:24,385 --> 00:20:27,877
Look, I heard screaming, okay?
And I went and I tried to help this guy.

310
00:20:27,955 --> 00:20:31,083
And when I heard the sirens, I just
ran away, okay? I didn't do nothing!

311
00:20:31,158 --> 00:20:33,183
Look, I believe you.
I think you saw something.

312
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,627
You witnessed something.
Tell me what it is.

313
00:20:36,697 --> 00:20:38,961
- I can't.
- You can tell us, Chantara.

314
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:44,598
- Come on. It's okay.
- Chantara.

315
00:20:44,672 --> 00:20:49,507
If you're afraid that what you tell us,
we're not gonna believe it, don't be.

316
00:20:49,577 --> 00:20:52,171
So whatever it is
you saw tonight,

317
00:20:52,246 --> 00:20:54,476
whatever it is,
whatever you think you saw,

318
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:58,416
however strange
or terrifying or bizarre,

319
00:20:58,486 --> 00:21:00,477
you are not gonna
surprise me.

320
00:21:00,554 --> 00:21:02,488
Okay?

321
00:21:03,924 --> 00:21:06,392
You'll protect me
from Chuko?

322
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,623
- Who's Chuko?
- Mi novio.

323
00:21:09,697 --> 00:21:12,723
He's the one who cut that guy up,
not me! I didn't do anything!

324
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,166
- I'm sorry. What?
- Mi novio. Her boyfriend.

325
00:21:15,236 --> 00:21:17,170
No, I got that.

326
00:21:18,773 --> 00:21:21,139
Look, he's been chasing me
for a week, okay?

327
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:25,372
He said he was gonna twist my
neck off like a little chicken
if I didn't give him more money.

328
00:21:25,446 --> 00:21:27,914
- Chuko.
- Chuko Munos.

329
00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:30,081
The cops know who he is.

330
00:21:36,487 --> 00:21:38,921
This is my favorite part of the job...
knockin' down crack houses.

331
00:21:38,989 --> 00:21:40,752
I heard that.

332
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:42,918
I don't understand.
I told you everything you need to know!

333
00:21:42,993 --> 00:21:45,461
- Chantara, first of all,
- I just wanna go home now!

334
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:48,089
you are not out of the woods yet
as far as possible
accessory charges, all right?

335
00:21:48,165 --> 00:21:51,532
- Chuko's the one you want!
- So the sooner we find him,
the sooner we can let you go.

336
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,661
He's gonna kill me! You don't
understand! He's gonna kill me!

337
00:21:53,737 --> 00:21:55,762
He told me he was gonna
twist my neck off like a chicken!

338
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,705
Chantara, no one's
gonna kill you.

339
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,437
- He's gonna kill me!
- Chantara, look around...
look around you!

340
00:22:00,511 --> 00:22:04,345
You see all the deputies here?
You see? No one is going to get you.

341
00:22:04,415 --> 00:22:06,713
- Now, what's more, Deputy Wetzel here...

342
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,344
is going to keep an eye on you
while we go and put the cuffs on Chuko.

343
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,684
No one is going
to get you.

344
00:22:20,197 --> 00:22:23,325
Chuko Munos.
The man himself.

345
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,892
Only distinguishing feature
is a tattoo on his skull.

346
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,701
- He's not our guy.
- What do you mean?

347
00:22:29,773 --> 00:22:32,833
I don't care how bad his rep is,
he can't turn over a squad car.

348
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:36,073
Maybe not by himself,
but he's probably got friends, right?

349
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:38,445
There's something else
going on.

350
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,013
Let's hit it.

351
00:22:43,087 --> 00:22:45,612
Units on a warrant.
Let's hold all radio traffic.

352
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:10,008
Go, go, go!

353
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,605
Hands above your head!
Get your hands above your head!

354
00:23:14,818 --> 00:23:17,548
- Clear above your head!
- Let's see your hands!

355
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,388
- Have you seen Chuko Munos?
-  you, mother... [Bleep]

356
00:23:30,968 --> 00:23:33,129
Put your hands on the wall!
On the wall!

357
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,843
Get your  hands off me.

358
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:43,770
Oh, man.

359
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:46,577
Agents! Agents, in here.

360
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,090
Hey, what happened?
Wake up.

361
00:23:59,163 --> 00:24:01,927
- What happened to your friend in there?
- Check the tattoo.

362
00:24:05,436 --> 00:24:08,735
- Looks like he O.D. 'd.
- Yeah, but how long ago?

363
00:24:08,806 --> 00:24:11,297
Couple days. Maybe a week.

364
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,502
He didn't attack Ricky Kola,
that's for sure.

365
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:20,145
- Shots fired!

366
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,024
- It's here!
- What?

367
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:35,554
- It's gettin'away!
- What you got? What you shooting at?

368
00:24:35,633 --> 00:24:39,034
What are you shooting at?
Keith, what are you doin'?

369
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,867
It came back.
It was here.

370
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,237
-  It-It was here.
- Keith!

371
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,511
Oh, man. I heard her screamin',
and I tried to...

372
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,514
I tried to stop it.
I swear to you, I tried.

373
00:24:51,582 --> 00:24:54,210
- I did everything I could do.
- Oh, sh...

374
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,981
I did everything I could do.

375
00:24:57,054 --> 00:24:59,045
What is it, Mulder?

376
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:05,922
What...

377
00:25:10,868 --> 00:25:14,065
-  Call it in.
-  212-40,
I have a possible 9-27.

378
00:25:19,408 --> 00:25:21,933
I wish someone would explain
to me what the hell is going on here.

379
00:25:22,011 --> 00:25:24,036
It just doesn't make sense.

380
00:25:24,113 --> 00:25:28,675
Keith Wetzel may be a little green,
but he is a solid deputy.

381
00:25:28,751 --> 00:25:31,447
Nothing could've gotten past him
and killed that woman.

382
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,683
There's no sign of what he was
shooting at. This is all we found.

383
00:25:34,757 --> 00:25:36,748
Nine millimeter.
It's our issue.

384
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:39,056
- Where did you find that?
- It was lying in
the middle of the street.

385
00:25:39,128 --> 00:25:41,926
Doesn't look like
a ricochet.

386
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:45,456
Maybe Wetzel hit what he was aiming at.
Excuse me.

387
00:25:52,274 --> 00:25:54,208
Hey, Deputy.

388
00:25:55,378 --> 00:25:57,312
You ready
to talk to me now?

389
00:26:02,084 --> 00:26:05,485
You and I both know you saw something.
We're way past claiming you didn't.

390
00:26:09,592 --> 00:26:11,526
I only know
what I thought I saw.

391
00:26:11,594 --> 00:26:13,528
Well, describe it
for me.

392
00:26:18,134 --> 00:26:21,228
The Wasp Man.

393
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:26,908
The Wasp Man?

394
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:29,308
- It's ridicu... It's ridiculous.

395
00:26:29,378 --> 00:26:31,744
Scary stories my older brother
used to tell me when I was a kid...

396
00:26:31,814 --> 00:26:34,374
about a monster,
head like a wasp...

397
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,714
and a mouth full of stingers
instead of teeth.

398
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,318
He said that it would
come get me in my sleep,

399
00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:44,587
and that... and that it would
sting me to death.

400
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:48,152
So you're saying that the Wasp Man
attacked you both times...

401
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,960
- Here and earlier in the patrol car?
- I...

402
00:26:51,033 --> 00:26:54,628
I'm not saying that
that's what it was, okay?

403
00:26:54,703 --> 00:26:58,298
I mean, they didn't see it.
It's not on the videotape.

404
00:27:01,377 --> 00:27:03,368
This-This can't be real.

405
00:27:03,446 --> 00:27:06,609
No, I think maybe it can.
Just relax a minute. Excuse me.

406
00:27:06,682 --> 00:27:10,812
Scully, we came on this case
lookin' for a werewolf, right?

407
00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:12,820
No, you did.
That's correct.

408
00:27:12,888 --> 00:27:15,118
Hymen Escallera claimed
he was attacked by a werewolf,

409
00:27:15,191 --> 00:27:19,491
and the wounds that he sustained
would seem to bear that out, right?

410
00:27:19,562 --> 00:27:22,224
And then, uh,
Wetzel over here sees a wasp man...

411
00:27:22,298 --> 00:27:24,266
with stingers for teeth,
and he gets a bite mark...

412
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,858
that you say is irrefutably
insect-like, right?

413
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,302
Mulder, that's not exactly...

414
00:27:29,371 --> 00:27:31,464
And another eyewitness
claims she sees Freddy Krueger.

415
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,998
Scully, what if... what if
we're dealing with one creature,

416
00:27:35,077 --> 00:27:39,309
one entity, that when it attacks appears
to you as your worst nightmare?

417
00:27:39,381 --> 00:27:43,112
Fear. Maybe that's what
this thing feeds on.

418
00:27:45,354 --> 00:27:48,323
- Okay, well, for the sake
of this argument,
- Yeah?

419
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,858
how would one catch
something like that?

420
00:27:53,262 --> 00:27:57,221
Probably by... by figuring out
how it chooses its prey.

421
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:00,132
I mean, they're...
It seems to spread like a contagion.

422
00:28:00,202 --> 00:28:03,729
One person's fear becomes the next.
There's a definite chain of victims.

423
00:28:03,806 --> 00:28:06,832
Tonight it went from Mrs. Guerrero
to Wetzel and the sketch artist.

424
00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:11,107
And then from the sketch artist
to Chantara Gomez.

425
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,307
- And then... Right.
- Chantara Gomez back to Wetzel.

426
00:28:13,382 --> 00:28:16,317
- But you're missing someone, Mulder.
- Who?

427
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,712
Edy.
Steve and Edy.

428
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:22,723
They're a part
of this chain too.

429
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:25,282
And according to your theory,
they would've been attacked, right?

430
00:28:41,443 --> 00:28:44,037
So we're back at the home
of Steve and Edy.

431
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:48,277
We should probably check on them because
they seem to fit a victim profile.

432
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,410
I'm sorry.
Are you talking to me?

433
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:58,157
-  Shut up!
What's going on with you?
- Hey!

434
00:29:01,163 --> 00:29:05,190
What the hell are...
What the hell is this?

435
00:29:05,267 --> 00:29:07,929
Steve, are you gonna be all right?

436
00:29:08,003 --> 00:29:10,972
- I'm all right.
Somebody ask if I'm all right.!

437
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,009
I'm the victim! I'm the victim here!
He don't treat me right.

438
00:29:14,076 --> 00:29:16,044
- All right.
- You better appreciate me, or I'll walk!

439
00:29:16,111 --> 00:29:19,205
- The hell you would!
- We're not here to get involved
in any kind of personal...

440
00:29:19,281 --> 00:29:22,216
He treats my mama with disrespect!
He treats me with disrespect!

441
00:29:22,284 --> 00:29:24,411
- Oh, shut up!
- We're not here to get involved
with personal problems.

442
00:29:24,486 --> 00:29:28,183
- See? You! You shut up!
- Settle down.

443
00:29:28,257 --> 00:29:30,623
He won't make love to me.

444
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:32,627
Oh. Uh...

445
00:29:32,695 --> 00:29:34,663
- I should have never touched
your stupid ass!
- All right.

446
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:37,631
- Oh, no, no!
- Look, you guys.

447
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,466
Steve, Edy, the reason
why we are here...

448
00:29:41,537 --> 00:29:44,233
is because we are concerned
about your safety.

449
00:29:44,306 --> 00:29:46,240
- How's that?
- We're concerned about your lives.

450
00:29:46,308 --> 00:29:49,038
You witnessed a violent attack
right across the street from your house.

451
00:29:49,111 --> 00:29:51,944
So you say! I just saw
a rolled up boy with crazy hair!

452
00:29:52,014 --> 00:29:54,676
Well, take our word for it.
Because of your proximity to the attack,

453
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,479
we think you may be
targeted as well.

454
00:29:56,552 --> 00:29:59,043
- Why? Because we called the police?
- No, no, no.

455
00:29:59,121 --> 00:30:01,954
That's not why.
I can't really explain it exactly, but...

456
00:30:02,024 --> 00:30:05,118
I think the key is to remain
unemotional, okay?

457
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:08,163
Try to stay calm.
Try to keep your heart rate down.

458
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,164
Try to keep your adrenaline down.
Try to...

459
00:30:10,232 --> 00:30:12,462
- Just try to relax.
-  Oh, no!

460
00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:15,059
Good luck! You don't know
who you're talkin'to about that!

461
00:30:15,137 --> 00:30:17,605
Oh, you!

462
00:30:17,673 --> 00:30:19,470
Yeah, I think maybe we should
stay here for a little while.

463
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:21,475
All right, let's just...

464
00:30:21,543 --> 00:30:24,376
let's just...
let's just, uh, relax.

465
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:26,573
Just relax.

466
00:30:29,752 --> 00:30:32,585
Mr. Mulder, lookee here.

467
00:30:32,655 --> 00:30:34,589
I got to go to bed.

468
00:30:37,693 --> 00:30:41,094
How ya doin', Edy?
You still upset?

469
00:30:43,198 --> 00:30:45,462
I'm scared.

470
00:30:45,534 --> 00:30:48,264
You're scared?

471
00:30:48,337 --> 00:30:50,464
I'm scared
he's gonna leave me.

472
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:03,680
Oh!

473
00:31:03,752 --> 00:31:05,686
No, man. No.

474
00:31:07,022 --> 00:31:09,149
You think we should
take 'em to a hotel?

475
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,094
- We don't need no hotel.
- Mm-mmm.

476
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,289
- We've been livin' in
this house for 17 years.
- Oh, yeah.

477
00:31:15,364 --> 00:31:17,298
- Ain't nobody gonna chase us out.
- Mm-mmm.

478
00:31:17,366 --> 00:31:19,596
- You're not afraid?
- Now, I didn't say that.

479
00:31:19,668 --> 00:31:22,034
I said ain't nobody
gonna chase us out.

480
00:31:22,104 --> 00:31:24,605
- Mm-mmm.
- No.

481
00:31:30,744 --> 00:31:33,611
Oh, God.
More of you?

482
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,377
- Are we any closer to an arrest?
- I'm afraid not.

483
00:31:37,451 --> 00:31:39,442
- Mulder, what next?
- Well, I'd say...

484
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,453
we should station
a couple deputies out here,

485
00:31:41,521 --> 00:31:43,455
but I don't think
it's coming back here.

486
00:31:43,523 --> 00:31:47,584
We're just playing catch-up with this
thing. It doesn't do what you'd expect.

487
00:31:47,661 --> 00:31:50,494
And, uh... Well, we got
four or five hours till the moon sets.

488
00:31:50,564 --> 00:31:54,193
The attacks only occur on a full moon.
Then we're out of luck.

489
00:31:54,267 --> 00:31:56,861
Well, I want to examine
Chantara Gomez.

490
00:31:56,937 --> 00:31:59,838
-  For a possible contagion?
- Your contagion of fear?

491
00:31:59,906 --> 00:32:01,840
- Yeah. No?
- No.

492
00:32:01,908 --> 00:32:05,207
But if I can't figure out
what this thing was, at least
I can figure out what it wasn't.

493
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:08,372
Make it fast.
And fill that tank up with gas.

494
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,916
Uh, Deputy, you're the only person
that's seen this twice,

495
00:32:10,984 --> 00:32:13,145
so I'd like to ride with you
if you don't mind.

496
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,620
- Let's go.
- Thanks.

497
00:32:32,973 --> 00:32:34,907
You really believe me,
huh?

498
00:32:34,975 --> 00:32:37,205
You really believe I saw
what I thought I saw?

499
00:32:37,277 --> 00:32:39,302
Yeah, I believe you.

500
00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:41,939
- Why?
- Why do I believe you?

501
00:32:42,015 --> 00:32:44,483
Yeah, I mean, what proof do you have
what I'm saying is real?

502
00:32:44,551 --> 00:32:46,781
I mean, it's not...
it's not on the videotape.

503
00:32:48,722 --> 00:32:50,917
The camera doesn't always
tell the whole story.

504
00:32:52,025 --> 00:32:53,959
And what about
your partner?

505
00:32:54,027 --> 00:32:55,961
Does she believe me?

506
00:32:57,297 --> 00:32:59,288
I don't think
she thinks you're lying.

507
00:33:00,534 --> 00:33:03,594
Yeah, but what?
Maybe I'm crazy?

508
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:06,036
I've been on the job 18 months.
It's all I ever wanted to do.

509
00:33:06,106 --> 00:33:09,598
Right out of the gate,
I get some kind of rep like I'm crazy.

510
00:33:09,676 --> 00:33:11,974
I mean,
you know how cops are.

511
00:33:12,045 --> 00:33:14,946
How's somebody supposed
to live that down?

512
00:33:15,015 --> 00:33:17,506
I don't know.

513
00:33:17,584 --> 00:33:20,109
I guess just do
good work.

514
00:33:20,187 --> 00:33:22,655
I mean, it's a hard enough
job already, you know?

515
00:33:22,723 --> 00:33:25,248
You want to help people, but it's like
the freakin' wild west out here.

516
00:33:25,325 --> 00:33:27,259
You know people hate you?

517
00:33:28,595 --> 00:33:31,621
Every shift I go out
thinkin'...

518
00:33:31,698 --> 00:33:33,632
Go ahead.

519
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,134
I go out thinkin', "You know,
there is somebody out there...

520
00:33:36,203 --> 00:33:38,398
"who wants to take me out.

521
00:33:38,472 --> 00:33:40,406
Am I gonna
run into him tonight?"

522
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:46,745
It's hard to have a fast-track career
in law enforcement...

523
00:33:46,813 --> 00:33:49,475
when everybody thinks
you're nuts.

524
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:51,483
Tell me about it.

525
00:33:51,551 --> 00:33:55,214
Chantara Gomez, age 31.

526
00:33:55,288 --> 00:33:57,813
Apparent cause of death
is the fracturing...

527
00:33:57,891 --> 00:34:00,257
of the second and third
cervical vertebrae.

528
00:34:00,327 --> 00:34:04,229
There are contusions
consistent with a choking...

529
00:34:04,297 --> 00:34:08,131
or a throttling
by very powerful hands.

530
00:34:08,201 --> 00:34:10,829
People are saying her pimp killed her
from beyond the grave.

531
00:34:12,372 --> 00:34:14,602
That's the story going around.
It's crazy, huh?

532
00:34:14,674 --> 00:34:17,302
Well, let's see if we can
put that story to rest, shall we?

533
00:34:18,845 --> 00:34:21,040
The other thing I heard
was, uh,

534
00:34:21,114 --> 00:34:23,048
something about contagion.

535
00:34:23,116 --> 00:34:25,209
- Like, with this body?

536
00:34:25,285 --> 00:34:28,482
That's-That's completely
inaccurate.

537
00:34:28,555 --> 00:34:30,455
It's, uh...

538
00:34:30,524 --> 00:34:35,120
The investigation is... We're moving
towards an apparent chain of victims.

539
00:34:35,195 --> 00:34:37,720
And I seriously doubt that
we're gonna find anything...

540
00:34:37,798 --> 00:34:40,858
that looks like
a contagious pathology here.

541
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:43,960
Because, I mean, if we were,
we should be taking precautions.

542
00:34:44,037 --> 00:34:47,495
If the body
could be contagious, you...

543
00:34:47,574 --> 00:34:49,542
We're not even
wearing masks.

544
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:51,941
Look, this is obviously
a murder here.

545
00:34:52,012 --> 00:34:54,378
I mean, this woman died
of a broken neck, right?

546
00:34:54,447 --> 00:34:57,007
Not the hantavirus.

547
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:59,574
- Who said anything about the hantavirus?
- Nobody.

548
00:34:59,653 --> 00:35:03,384
I just... I was, um...
It was a figure of speech.

549
00:35:05,325 --> 00:35:07,259
The reason I ask is,
why is it so urgent...

550
00:35:07,327 --> 00:35:10,228
to do an autopsy
at 3:00 in the morning?

551
00:35:10,297 --> 00:35:12,424
I mean, that kind of rush.
It's just unheard of.

552
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:16,499
We are trying to look
for the killer.

553
00:35:18,305 --> 00:35:21,468
We got murder victims
stacked three deep in the freezer.

554
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:25,976
Plus, you got this camera crew
recording everything. Why?

555
00:35:28,882 --> 00:35:31,316
Because the F.B.I.
has nothing to hide.

556
00:35:34,087 --> 00:35:36,282
Look, there is
no ulterior motive here.

557
00:35:36,356 --> 00:35:38,654
It's...

558
00:35:38,725 --> 00:35:41,455
Are you gonna
help me out here or what?

559
00:35:41,528 --> 00:35:43,462
Yeah, of course.

560
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,498
Thank you.

561
00:35:45,565 --> 00:35:47,499
Why did you mention
the hantavirus?

562
00:35:47,567 --> 00:35:52,027
- Look, I...

563
00:35:52,105 --> 00:35:54,039
Oh, my God.

564
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:08,287
- Call 911. Call 911!

565
00:36:08,355 --> 00:36:10,687
911! Get out of here!
Come on!

566
00:36:14,626 --> 00:36:16,560
It's not the hantavirus.

567
00:36:16,628 --> 00:36:19,529
It looks for all the world
like the hantavirus,

568
00:36:19,598 --> 00:36:23,261
but I can promise you
that it's not.

569
00:36:23,335 --> 00:36:25,963
Well, I mean, she exhibited
all the symptoms...

570
00:36:26,037 --> 00:36:29,165
the hemorrhagic fever,
the severe chills, acute shock...

571
00:36:29,241 --> 00:36:33,575
I mean, the thing is that they all
developed in a matter of seconds.

572
00:36:33,645 --> 00:36:36,239
And the hantavirus
doesn't kill that fast.

573
00:36:36,314 --> 00:36:39,181
I mean, no virus in the world
kills that fast.

574
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:43,813
You were talking about the hantavirus
right before she died?

575
00:36:43,889 --> 00:36:47,484
- Why?
- Because she kept bringing it up.

576
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:49,993
I mean, it was like
the power of suggestion, Mulder.

577
00:36:50,061 --> 00:36:54,088
She was standing there. She was saying
that she was afraid of contagion.

578
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:56,259
And then all of a sudden,
she just...

579
00:36:56,334 --> 00:37:00,361
She was afraid.
She was afraid,

580
00:37:00,438 --> 00:37:03,930
and her fear killed her in the worst
possible way that she could imagine.

581
00:37:04,009 --> 00:37:05,943
- And what do you mean by that?
- It's the same.

582
00:37:06,011 --> 00:37:08,502
It's the same M.O., what we've been
looking for all night.

583
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:13,449
This entity or force somehow
vectored off Chantara Gomez
to attack this other woman.

584
00:37:13,518 --> 00:37:15,816
No, Mulder.
I was standing right here.

585
00:37:15,887 --> 00:37:18,515
I didn't see anything.
They didn't see anything.

586
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,785
Yeah, but you weren't afraid.

587
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:23,589
The hell I wasn't afraid.
I don't know what's going on here.

588
00:37:23,662 --> 00:37:26,495
No, you weren't afraid
for your life.

589
00:37:26,565 --> 00:37:29,125
Neither were Steve and Edy,
and it left them alone.

590
00:37:29,201 --> 00:37:32,364
Mortal fear. I think
that's what it comes down to.

591
00:37:32,437 --> 00:37:35,338
This thing, whatever it is,
is attracted to that.

592
00:37:35,407 --> 00:37:38,570
Everybody who was attacked
felt that intensely.

593
00:37:38,643 --> 00:37:42,545
- For  sakes.
- No, no, no. It makes perfect sense.

594
00:37:42,614 --> 00:37:45,674
You asked me earlier, "What would
this thing be doing in Willow Park?"

595
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,911
Well, where else would it go
but a high-crime neighborhood?

596
00:37:47,986 --> 00:37:51,422
Somewhere where people live
behind barred windows and
are afraid to go out at night.

597
00:37:53,892 --> 00:37:57,157
- Where's Deputy Wetzel?
- Back on patrol.

598
00:37:57,229 --> 00:37:59,959
Mulder, you were... you were walking
around with him for three hours.

599
00:38:00,031 --> 00:38:01,931
- You didn't see anything?
- No, no. But I was with him.

600
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,231
I was backing him up.

601
00:38:05,303 --> 00:38:08,704
Like I said,
there's something about a full moon.

602
00:38:08,773 --> 00:38:10,764
Things definitely
get strange.

603
00:38:15,013 --> 00:38:18,949
Well, we checked
everyplace else tonight.

604
00:38:19,017 --> 00:38:20,951
Let's check this place again.

605
00:39:11,336 --> 00:39:14,066
Aw! Come on.

606
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,538
God...

607
00:39:20,045 --> 00:39:22,570
- I'm callin' for backup.

608
00:39:22,647 --> 00:39:24,638
Get out!
Get out now! Get out!

609
00:39:24,716 --> 00:39:28,015
- It won't open!
- Let's go! I got it! I got it!

610
00:39:28,086 --> 00:39:31,522
- Come on! I can't open it!
- Oh, God!

611
00:39:33,425 --> 00:39:36,417
Oh...

612
00:39:44,302 --> 00:39:46,236
That's Wetzel's car.

613
00:40:08,526 --> 00:40:10,721
- Wetzel!
- Get the battering ram.

614
00:40:10,795 --> 00:40:12,729
Let's go around back.

615
00:40:21,806 --> 00:40:24,070
That gun's not gonna do ya any good.

616
00:40:52,737 --> 00:40:55,262
That's
the battering ram.

617
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,672
Well, how come
they're not in yet?

618
00:41:03,615 --> 00:41:06,413
- Wind?
- If you say so.

619
00:41:14,893 --> 00:41:17,623
- I wonder who's in there.

620
00:41:31,943 --> 00:41:34,503
Damn!

621
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:36,740
- I hate you guys.
- Where's Wetzel?

622
00:41:36,815 --> 00:41:38,806
We don't know.
There's something out there.

623
00:41:38,883 --> 00:41:41,215
- Stay where you are.
-  yeah!

624
00:41:41,286 --> 00:41:44,414
Look at this. Scully.

625
00:41:49,527 --> 00:41:52,496
- Deputy Wetzel?
-  Scully!

626
00:41:52,564 --> 00:41:54,498
Have you found him?

627
00:41:58,803 --> 00:42:00,737
Wetzel?

628
00:42:06,878 --> 00:42:09,904
- Wetzel?

629
00:42:09,981 --> 00:42:12,506
- Wetzel!

630
00:42:14,586 --> 00:42:18,989
- Wetzel!
- Help me! Please help me!

631
00:42:19,057 --> 00:42:20,991
Wetzel,
don't be afraid!

632
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:23,823
- It can't hurt you! Don't be afraid!

633
00:42:23,895 --> 00:42:26,557
- That's what it wants! Look... Wetzel!
- Help me!

634
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:30,863
It can't hurt you! You're a
sheriff s deputy, Wetzel!

635
00:42:30,935 --> 00:42:35,099
Don't be afraid now! You're on
national television, so cowboy up!

636
00:42:39,878 --> 00:42:41,812
Jeez!

637
00:42:49,454 --> 00:42:52,014
Wetzel.

638
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:54,024
He's alive.

639
00:42:56,261 --> 00:42:57,956
-  Deputy Wetzel!

640
00:42:58,029 --> 00:42:59,963
We're up here!

641
00:43:08,439 --> 00:43:12,000
What happened?

642
00:43:14,445 --> 00:43:16,379
The sun just came up.

643
00:43:21,217 --> 00:43:23,151
Hang in there, kid.

644
00:43:24,587 --> 00:43:28,284
Do you think the deputy
stopped it, whatever it was?

645
00:43:28,357 --> 00:43:30,382
Maybe it just went away
until the next full moon.

646
00:43:31,994 --> 00:43:33,928
I don't know. You gotta figure
there's enough fear in the world...

647
00:43:33,996 --> 00:43:38,365
that if it doesn't show up in Willow
Park, it's gonna show up someplace else.

648
00:43:38,434 --> 00:43:40,834
You didn't get the proof
that you wanted, Mulder.

649
00:43:40,903 --> 00:43:43,633
Well, hey, it all depends
on how they edit it together.

650
00:43:43,706 --> 00:43:45,936
This is gonna be
