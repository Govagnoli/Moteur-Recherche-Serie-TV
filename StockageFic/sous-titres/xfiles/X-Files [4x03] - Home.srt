At the same time, I knew
we couldn't stay hidden forever,

93
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,847
that one day
the modern world would find us...

94
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:25,544

would change forever.

00:08:25,618 --> 00:08:27,677

97
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:32,416

100
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:41,089

but I didn't know
where else to turn.

103
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,800
So I called the bureau
in Pittsburgh, and when
I described the victim,

104
00:08:51,878 --> 00:08:53,812
they said
I should see you.

105
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,610
Maybe we should take a look
at the victim then.

106
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:05,923
We don't have a lab
or a morgue.

107
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:09,553

might be a bit cleaner.

The thing is, see, folks
have been dropping in
to ask about the case,

113
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:35,377
and I wouldn't want anybody
to pop in and see this.

114

to the office.

lock the door.

have to order DNA typing
from the crime lab,

119
00:10:04,717 --> 00:10:08,153

abnormalities associated with...

120
00:10:08,254 --> 00:10:10,916
Neu-Laxova syndrome,

121
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,550
Meckel-Gruber syndrome,
atrophy of the cloaca.

122
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:15,617
I don't even know
where to begin.

123

I guess we can rule out murder
as the cause of death, huh?

124
00:10:18,598 --> 00:10:21,761
I don't know about that.

125
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:31,600
There's evidence
of occlusion due to dirt
in the nose and mouth,

126
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:34,703
indicating the dirt
has been inhaled.

127
00:10:34,814 --> 00:10:37,282
There's something rotten
in Mayberry.

and dreams for her child...

00:10:47,026 --> 00:10:49,824
What must a mother
go through?

131
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:53,195
Apparently not much
in this case, if she'd just
throw it out with the trash.

132
00:10:59,973 --> 00:11:03,109
I-l guess I wasjust
projecting on myself.

133
00:11:03,109 --> 00:11:07,739
- Why, is there a history of genetic
abnormalities in your family?
- No.

134
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:10,749
Well,just find yourself a man
with a spotless genetic makeup...

135
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:12,808
and a really high tolerance
for being second-guessed...

136
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:15,945
and start pumping out
the little Uber-Scullys.

137
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:20,058
- What abour your family?
- Hmm?

138
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:24,194
Well, aside from the need
for corrective lenses...

139
00:11:24,263 --> 00:11:26,493
and a tendency to be abducted
by extraterrestrials...

140
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:29,000
involved in an international
governmental conspiracy,

141
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:31,627
the Mulder family
passes genetic muster.

142
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:38,610
Scully, that child inside
is a tragedy.

143
00:11:38,678 --> 00:11:43,615
Some young parents,
probably scared kids,
disposed of an unwanted birth.

144
00:11:43,683 --> 00:11:45,844
In a very certain sense,
infanticide is involved,

145
00:11:45,918 --> 00:11:47,852
but this is not
an F.B.I. matter.

146
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,650
But from what I know
about genetic defects, Mulder,

147
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:54,159
it's unlikely that child is the result
ofa single polygenic mating.

148
00:11:54,227 --> 00:11:56,491
We should let local authorities
investigate that.

149
00:11:56,562 --> 00:12:00,225
Those defects, Mulder,
are autosomal-dominant disorders,

150
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:03,928
and from the degree, I'd say, mutations
that go back many generations.

151
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:08,974
Scully, Sheriff Taylor implied
that the boys in that family...

152
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:12,170
were not really the type
that could easily get dates.

153
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:15,271
But he also implied that
they practice inbreeding.

154
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:17,976
Now, we all have a natural
instinct to propagate--

155
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:20,019
Do we?

156
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:23,681
There are theories which pose
that our bodies are...

157
00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:26,657
simply vehicles for genes
needing to replicate.

158
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:30,719
Yeah, but there's no sister.

159
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:33,459
The mother's been dead
for ten years.

160
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:36,024
But if that instinct and
the need is strong enough,

161
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:38,626
they will answer it
anyway that they can.

162
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:41,206
Now, a woman gave birth
to that child, Mulder,

163
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:43,502
and, my guess is,
against her will.

164
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:47,738
And kidnapping
is a bureau matter.

165
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:51,983
Scully...

166
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:57,480

as a mother before.

168
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:51,542

The way I think
it goes here...

382

is that Edmund is the brother
and father of the other two.

383
00:37:46,544 --> 00:37:49,069
Which means that
when Edmund was a kid,

384

he could ground the other two
for playing with his things?
