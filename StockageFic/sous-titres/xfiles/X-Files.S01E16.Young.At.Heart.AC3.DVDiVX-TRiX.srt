1
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:25,929
(screaming)

2
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:54,996
God... what areyou doing
to Barnett?

3
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:58,629
- Excuse me?
- What areyou doing toJohnny?

4
00:00:58,705 --> 00:01:01,139
Go back toyourward.

5
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,142
There's nothing
you can do foryour friend now.

6
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,075
What?

7
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:06,237
john Barnett's dead.

8
00:01:06,313 --> 00:01:08,975
No, I heard him screaming.

9
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:14,745
I saidJohn Barnett is dead.

10
00:01:14,855 --> 00:01:16,413
You understand?

11
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:23,228
Go on, Crandall.
Get outta here.

12
00:01:24,798 --> 00:01:27,892
There's nothing more to see here.
You understand?

13
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:36,327
What does this
have to do with us?

14
00:02:36,403 --> 00:02:38,997
Robbing ajewelry store
is a federal crime.

15
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:40,130
Thankyou.

16
00:02:40,207 --> 00:02:42,698
I got a call from some guy
I used to workwith

17
00:02:42,776 --> 00:02:44,710
in the Violent Crime section.

18
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:46,211
Said it was important.

19
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:55,016
(chanting:)
Reggie, Reggie.

20
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:57,682
Mulder. God, I hate it
when you do that.

21
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,656
This is Special Agent Scully.

22
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:00,488
Reggie Purdue.

23
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:01,458
How areyou?

24
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:02,961
What happened here?

25
00:03:03,029 --> 00:03:05,429
Lone gunman took out a salesgirl

26
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:08,229
after she filled up a bag for him.

27
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:09,962
You guys turn up anything?

28
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:12,129
Not much...

29
00:03:12,205 --> 00:03:13,866
except...

30
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,998
this.

31
00:03:15,075 --> 00:03:17,305
It's going to blowyour mind.

32
00:03:17,377 --> 00:03:18,639
Why?

33
00:03:18,712 --> 00:03:20,077
I'm telling you, Mulder

34
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:24,048
this is going
to blowyour mind.

35
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:27,446
What is it?

36
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:28,783
Wait a second.

37
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:31,153
You see why I called you?

38
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:32,953
What about witness descriptions?

39
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:36,620
White male, 5'1 1 " to 6', ski mask.

40
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:40,332
Damn it, Reggie.
That's Barnett.

41
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,697
But it can't be.

42
00:03:43,603 --> 00:03:45,036
Who's Barnett?

43
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:51,974
Mulder:
It was my first case at the bureau.

44
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:54,605
Barnett was doing
armedjobs all over D.C.

45
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:55,909
Very trigger happy.

46
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:57,313
Killed seven people.

47
00:03:57,384 --> 00:03:59,215
There was this big task force.

48
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:00,810
Reggie was myASAC.

49
00:04:00,887 --> 00:04:03,447
I was 28, right out
ofthe academy.

50
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:05,650
I had this theory on the case.

51
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,886
Reggie thought I was full ofit.

52
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:09,222
What was the theory?

53
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:11,354
That Barnett had
an inside connection.

54
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:13,625
An employee at the armored car company

55
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,533
was tipping him off
about large shipments ofcash.

56
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:17,797
I was sort ofright.

57
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:18,838
Sort of?

58
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:20,167
We planted bogus waybills

59
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,004
manifests with the armored
car company to set a trap

60
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:25,271
but Barnett was way ahead ofus.

61
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:27,575
That's when the notes started.

62
00:04:28,782 --> 00:04:31,410
" Fox can't guard
the chicken coop."

63
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:32,849
Clever, huh?

64
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:34,910
So, you never caught him?

65
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:36,080
No, we did.

66
00:04:36,156 --> 00:04:38,818
We did, but not, uh, not clean.

67
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:42,326
An agent died because I screwed up.

68
00:04:45,398 --> 00:04:47,366
And what happened to Barnett?

69
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:50,129
He avoided the death penalty

70
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:52,467
but he went down
for everyjob he did.

71
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:54,939
Consecutive terms-- 340 years.

72
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:57,340
Thejudge promised me
he would die in prison.

73
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,844
Soyou think he escaped?

74
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:01,175
No, that'sjust it.

75
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:03,909
He did die in prison, fouryears ago.

76
00:05:03,984 --> 00:05:06,111
You're sure?

77
00:05:06,186 --> 00:05:08,848
I was paying attention.

78
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:13,758
Woman:
This guy a friend ofyours?

79
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,420
Mulder:
Yeah. I play golfwith him every Sunday.

80
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:18,520
What doyou think?

81
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:21,396
Youjust brought this in
ten minutes ago.

82
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:23,197
You're slipping, Henderson.

83
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:26,204
Ten minutes may be
enough time foryou, Mulder.

84
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:28,240
Ofcourse, I wouldn't know that

85
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:29,536
from personal experience.

86
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:31,406
Seriously, what doyou think?

87
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:33,378
Okay, first impressions--

88
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:35,073
The ink is fresh,

89
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:38,345
the note was written
in the last 48 hours.

90
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:41,080
Ballpoint, butyou knew that.

91
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:42,678
A right-hander.

92
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:43,916
Let's see...

93
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,855
written by someone sitting down.

94
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,893
But now I'm just showing off.

95
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:49,895
Yeah, does it match Barnett?

96
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:52,898
I'd say it's him.

97
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:54,900
Butyou're not sure?

98
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:55,992
95%.

99
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:57,400
The writing's sloppy.

100
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,837
Some ofthe ascenders
and descenders are heavier.

101
00:06:00,907 --> 00:06:03,637
Could it have been traced
over a note of Barnett's?

102
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,737
Could be, but it's
a damn goodjob ifit is.

103
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:09,907
Thanks, Henderson. I oweyou one.

104
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:12,474
Promises, promises.

105
00:06:15,955 --> 00:06:17,149
Purdue:
There's Barnett.

106
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:19,350
We'd staked out
an airport warehouse

107
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,256
but everything went to hell

108
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:24,853
when Barnett took the driver
ofthe armored truck hostage.

109
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:26,454
Where's Mulder?

110
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:28,431
There, coming around back.

111
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:30,264
Barnett doesn't see him.

112
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,773
He's got a clear shot.

113
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:36,502
Yeah, he should have taken it.

114
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:39,479
But he couldn't.

115
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:43,048
No, not with a hostage so close.

116
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:46,415
Because it's not by the book.

117
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:50,923
It would have saved
one life, maybe two.

118
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,426
Bastard Barnett
just started blasting away.

119
00:06:58,131 --> 00:06:59,723
Mulder did shoot Barnett.

120
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,301
Twice, in the shoulder and hand

121
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:05,496
but not before Barnett
killed the driver

122
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:08,336
and Agent Steve Wallenberg.

123
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:12,640
Mulder never forgave himself
for that.

124
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:14,543
You should have heard
his testimony

125
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:16,206
at Barnett's trial.

126
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:19,217
Probably had a lot to do
with Barnett's sentence.

127
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:21,515
I'll never forget Mulder

128
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:24,079
coming down from the witness stand

129
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:28,093
and Barnett turning
and saying he'd get Mulder.

130
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:30,128
To tell you the truth

131
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:34,257
I wish Mulder had killed Barnett
right there in the warehouse.

132
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:49,147
What did Henderson come up with?

133
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:51,581
95% sure it's Barnett's handwriting.

134
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:52,982
What's that?

135
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:54,280
Federal Bureau of Prisons

136
00:07:54,354 --> 00:07:56,879
sent me a copy
ofhis death certificate.

137
00:07:56,956 --> 00:07:59,356
" Name ofdeceased:
Barnett,John lrvin.

138
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:02,258
Cause ofdeath:
cardiac arrest.

139
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:05,456
Date: September 1 6, 1 989."

140
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:07,123
It must be a clever copycat.

141
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:09,633
The note was written
in the last 48 hours.

142
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:10,464
Pull any prints?

143
00:08:10,537 --> 00:08:11,697
No prints.

144
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:14,262
Barnett had a lot
oftime on his hands.

145
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,274
Maybe he planned it
with someone on the outside.

146
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:18,276
Revenge from the grave?
That would be a neat trick.

147
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:20,938
He planned to getyou, didn't he?

148
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,609
I wasjust down
talking to Agent Purdue.

149
00:08:26,686 --> 00:08:29,348
And he showed you the videotape?

150
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:34,259
You did the right thing, Mulder.

151
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,296
Did l? Steve Wallenberg
had a wife and two kids.

152
00:08:38,364 --> 00:08:41,299
One ofhis boys is an all-star
on his football team now.

153
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:43,631
I pulled that trigger
two seconds earlier

154
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:45,637
and Wallenberg would be here
to see his kid play.

155
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:47,639
Instead, I've got some dead man

156
00:08:47,707 --> 00:08:50,972
robbingjewelry stores
and sending me haikus.

157
00:08:52,745 --> 00:08:55,305
Down... set... hup!

158
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:57,781
Let's go! Let's go now!

159
00:08:57,851 --> 00:08:59,284
Fire it in there!

160
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:01,684
Yeah, that's better!

161
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:03,381
All right!
Bring it back here!

162
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:04,889
Let's go!

163
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,983
Hustle it up!
Line it up! Let's go!

164
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:08,617
Down!

165
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:10,161
Set! Hup!

166
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,199
Go! Go! Go! Go hard!

167
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:17,995
(applause)

168
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:22,257
I'll getyou,
you son ofa bitch!

169
00:10:50,296 --> 00:10:52,560
Purdue: I've been thinking about it,
Mulder, and I think...

170
00:10:52,632 --> 00:10:54,657
that somebody is messing
with your head.

171
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:57,201
Barnett said he'd get me.
You were there.

172
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,397
He's dead, Mulder.

173
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:00,529
Apparently not.

174
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,165
Let me tell you something.

175
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:05,608
There are a lot ofguys
who know Barnett made the threat.

176
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:06,770
It's Barnett, Reggie.

177
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:07,904
How can you say that?

178
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:09,915
I just feel it.

179
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:22,684
All this talk about spooky Mulder--

180
00:11:22,762 --> 00:11:24,957
I never used to pay it much mind.

181
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:28,125
I figured it wasjust talk
about how paranoid you were.

182
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:29,701
And now?

183
00:11:29,802 --> 00:11:32,236
Remember the day
you walked into my office

184
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:33,636
wet from Quantico?

185
00:11:33,706 --> 00:11:35,606
You pissed me off
just looking atyou

186
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:38,109
but then I saw
howyour mind worked.

187
00:11:38,177 --> 00:11:40,236
Howyou were always
threejumps ahead.

188
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:41,803
It was scary, Mulder.

189
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:43,041
Everybody said so.

190
00:11:43,116 --> 00:11:44,481
I've heard this story.

191
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,246
Well, maybeyou
ought to hear it again.

192
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,413
You let a lot ofpeople down
here in the bureau.

193
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:51,423
They had big plans foryou.

194
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:53,152
A lot ofpeople are saying

195
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:55,387
that spooky Mulder
has become an embarrassment

196
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:57,122
a liability.

197
00:11:57,196 --> 00:12:00,791
Areyou saying somebody
from the bureau's behind this?

198
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:02,232
Maybe, maybe not.

199
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:05,327
It's always best
to coveryour ass in any event.

200
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:10,703
Sorry.

201
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:12,711
This wasjust faxed.

202
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:15,805
It's a copy ofJohn Barnett's
last will and testament.

203
00:12:15,882 --> 00:12:17,042
No surviving relatives.

204
00:12:17,116 --> 00:12:19,846
Left what little he had
to another prisoner--

205
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,353
aJoe Crandall--
and instructions

206
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:24,515
for his body to be cremated.

207
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,525
His will was executed
six months after his death.

208
00:12:27,593 --> 00:12:29,857
This document states
that his ashes were spread

209
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:31,920
along the bank
ofthe Delaware River

210
00:12:31,998 --> 00:12:33,863
by an employee ofthe crematory

211
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:35,298
used by the prison.

212
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:37,961
It's like I said.
Somebody's messing with your head.

213
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:40,972
Killing a salesclerk
just to leave me a note?

214
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,134
I'd say that's going
a little out ofyourway.

215
00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:50,573
Mulder:
He's older now.

216
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,379
He may have put on some weight.

217
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:53,612
Woman:
How much older?

218
00:12:53,686 --> 00:12:54,948
Fiveyears.

219
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:04,519
He could be wearing
any kind ofdisguise.

220
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,078
Woman:
Take us back to the day in question.

221
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,085
Was ityour impression,
Agent Mulder, thatJohn Barnett

222
00:13:27,153 --> 00:13:30,589
took a kind ofa perverse
pleasure in his crimes?

223
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:33,853
Didn't he send you notes
to tauntyou?

224
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:35,416
Yes. I felt

225
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:37,395
that he was daring us to catch him.

226
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:38,953
That he killed his victims

227
00:13:39,031 --> 00:13:40,794
almost as ifit were
part ofa game.

228
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:44,166
Describe for the court,
ifyou would, Agent Mulder

229
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,137
what happened when you
finally caughtJohn Barnett.

230
00:13:47,206 --> 00:13:51,370
We had a customs warehouse
at the airport staked out.

231
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:53,605
We knew that Barnett had someone

232
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,613
working for
the armored car transport

233
00:13:55,681 --> 00:13:58,206
tipping him off
about large cash shipments

234
00:13:58,284 --> 00:14:00,411
but we never figured
that he would actually be

235
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:02,420
inside the vehicle
when it arrived.

236
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:04,183
That's how Barnett was able

237
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:06,157
to take the driver
ofthe vehicle hostage.

238
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:09,558
In otherwords,John Barnett
used his own accomplice

239
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:11,062
as a hostage?

240
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,961
Yes, ma'am.

241
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:15,091
And then what happened?

242
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:16,930
We surrounded Barnett.

243
00:14:17,036 --> 00:14:19,004
We ordered him
to surrender his hostage

244
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:20,572
and his weapon.

245
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:24,040
And where wereyou at this time,
Agent Mulder?

246
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,443
I was right behind Barnett.

247
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:29,981
With a clear shot at the suspect?

248
00:14:31,784 --> 00:14:33,217
Yes, ma'am.

249
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:36,119
Butyou didn't fire. Why?

250
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:38,953
It's against F.B.I. regulations

251
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:42,017
to unnecessarily endanger
the life ofa hostage

252
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:43,356
and I thought

253
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:45,829
that with no means ofescape

254
00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:47,866
Barnett would give up.

255
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:51,165
But what happened instead?

256
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:56,401
The suspect,John Barnett

257
00:14:56,475 --> 00:15:00,673
fired his weapon
point-blank at his hostage

258
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:04,682
and then he turned his gun
on Steve Wallenberg...

259
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:07,848
shot him in the face.

260
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:13,283
Thankyou, Agent Mulder.

261
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:16,522
No further questions at this time.

262
00:15:18,164 --> 00:15:20,496
He gunned him down
just for spite.

263
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:22,534
judge:
The witness will step down.

264
00:15:22,602 --> 00:15:25,696
Mulder:
Here's a man with a wife
and two small children

265
00:15:25,805 --> 00:15:27,067
and you shot him...

266
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:28,606
...without hesitation

267
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,905
without conscience,
without an ounce ofhumanity

268
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:33,969
which is whyyou should die
like an animal

269
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:35,570
you son ofa bitch!

270
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:38,276
judge:
I will find you in contempt!

271
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:39,682
- (people murmuring)
- Order in the court.

272
00:15:39,752 --> 00:15:43,085
Ifthere is not order
in this court

273
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:46,386
I will be forced
to clear the courtroom.

274
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:51,228
Man:
I ask that it be stricken
from the record.

275
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:52,730
judge:
Duly noted.

276
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:55,961
Thejurywill disregard
the witness's last statement.

277
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:05,536
(whispers:)
I'll... get... you.

278
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,690
I'll need printouts
ofeveryvariation.

279
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,593
Right.

280
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:21,355
Right.

281
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:23,588
I just got offthe phone
with the prison.

282
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:25,358
What did they come up with?

283
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:27,194
I called them on a hunch.

284
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:29,234
Barnett died ofa heart attack.

285
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:31,504
At least that's what it says
on his death certificate.

286
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:34,731
I had them fax me
all ofhis medical records.

287
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,070
Barnett was admitted
to the prison infirmary

288
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:39,269
for an infection
in his right hand.

289
00:16:39,378 --> 00:16:42,472
There isn't any indication
ofcoronary complications.

290
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:45,483
In fact, on his physical
six months earlier

291
00:16:45,551 --> 00:16:47,917
he was given
a clean bill ofhealth.

292
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,150
Crandall

293
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:54,124
someone to seeyou.

294
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:56,423
I don't get manyvisitors.

295
00:16:56,495 --> 00:16:58,486
You knewJohn Barnett?

296
00:16:58,564 --> 00:16:59,895
Yes, sir.

297
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:02,661
How well did you know him?

298
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:04,066
Prettywell.

299
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:06,730
He leftyou everything
he had in his will.

300
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,774
You must have known him
better than prettywell.

301
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:13,608
Used to change his bandages,
and wejust got to...

302
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,112
know each other.

303
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:17,775
Areyou aware that Barnett died
ofcardiac arrest

304
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,545
in this facility in 1 989?

305
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:21,609
Cardiac arrest?
Where does it say that?

306
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:23,712
On his death certificate.

307
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:28,517
He ain't dead, is he?

308
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:31,353
Why doyou say that?

309
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:35,264
Last time I sawJohn Barnett,
it was right in that room

310
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:37,268
over there.

311
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:39,736
Doctor took his bad hand clean off.

312
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,669
What doctor?

313
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:42,001
Was it Dr. Ridley?

314
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:43,575
Yeah, it was Dr. Ridley.

315
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:44,574
That's the one.

316
00:17:44,643 --> 00:17:46,577
He told meJohnnywas dead

317
00:17:46,645 --> 00:17:49,614
but, uh, I knew it was a lie.

318
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:52,617
Put a knife right up
under my chinjust for asking.

319
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:54,915
How could you tell
Barnett wasn't dead?

320
00:17:57,723 --> 00:18:00,783
I saw him looking at me.

321
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,794
I saw him blink.

322
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:07,726
I'll never forget those eyes.

323
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:18,009
What areyou going to do?

324
00:18:18,077 --> 00:18:20,204
I know what I'm not going to do.

325
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:22,576
I'm not going to hang around
and wait for Barnett

326
00:18:22,648 --> 00:18:24,115
to send me anothervalentine.

327
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:27,152
You mean the ghost
ofJohn Barnett.

328
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:31,581
I didn't knowyou believed
in ghosts, Scully.

329
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:35,119
(phone ringing)

330
00:18:43,436 --> 00:18:45,427
Hello?

331
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:47,096
Yeah,just a minute.

332
00:18:47,206 --> 00:18:49,140
It's foryou.

333
00:18:52,912 --> 00:18:54,174
Mulder.

334
00:18:55,915 --> 00:18:57,849
Fox Mulder.

335
00:18:57,917 --> 00:18:59,214
Barnett?

336
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:00,582
I'll run a trace.

337
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:02,086
You sound surprised.

338
00:19:02,154 --> 00:19:04,679
Well, you know, shouldn't I be?

339
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:08,523
You know, it's illegal
to tape another's phone call

340
00:19:08,594 --> 00:19:11,290
without their express permission.

341
00:19:11,363 --> 00:19:13,627
Isn't that what they call it?

342
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:15,633
In some states.

343
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:17,225
What makes you think
I'm taping you?

344
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:19,066
Same thing makes me think

345
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:21,129
you're putting a trace
on this call.

346
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,673
What state areyou in?

347
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:26,507
The same stateyou are.

348
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:30,879
I stood next toyou
in line for coffee this morning.

349
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,510
I don't think so.

350
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:40,352
Man, I'm everywhereyou are.

351
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:42,690
Everywhere.

352
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:45,059
I own you.

353
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,995
How do I know it's reallyyou?

354
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:50,593
What did I say toyou
in the courtroom?

355
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:54,799
Did you ever doubt me?

356
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:57,034
What did you tell me
in the courtroom?

357
00:19:57,142 --> 00:20:01,306
Ifyou thinkyou're going
to keep me on this phone

358
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,440
with this clumsy act...

359
00:20:04,517 --> 00:20:07,247
By all accounts,
john Barnett is a dead man.

360
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:11,619
Oh, you're the dead man, Mulder.

361
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,386
Fine. I just need confirmation

362
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,224
thatyou are
whoyou sayyou are.

363
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:21,130
You want confirmation?

364
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,293
You got it.

365
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:28,404
(kisses)

366
00:20:28,507 --> 00:20:31,169
Barnett? You there?

367
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:35,875
You lost him.

368
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:38,109
Yeah, he was hip to the trace.

369
00:20:38,183 --> 00:20:39,616
Was it Barnett?

370
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:42,017
john Barnett was from New Hampshire.

371
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:45,181
He had a slight accent.
Listen to this.

372
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:50,495
Fine. I just need confirmation

373
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:52,497
thatyou are
whoyou sayyou are.

374
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:54,328
You want confirmation?

375
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,833
You got it.

376
00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:57,163
(kisses)

377
00:20:59,905 --> 00:21:01,566
What did he mean by that?

378
00:21:01,674 --> 00:21:05,610
I don't know,
but that isJohn Barnett.

379
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:08,179
I'm sure ofit.

380
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,176
(phone ringing)

381
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,854
Oh...

382
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,152
Yeah.

383
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:23,819
Reggie, it's Mulder.

384
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:25,454
Mulder, what doyou want?

385
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:27,123
It's the middle ofthe night.

386
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:30,566
It's only 1 0:45, Reggie.

387
00:21:30,636 --> 00:21:33,264
Yeah, well, I was sleeping.

388
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:37,001
Listen, Reggie, it doesn't look
like Barnett's dead after all.

389
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:38,406
Now what?

390
00:21:38,477 --> 00:21:40,877
I got an inmate at the prison

391
00:21:40,946 --> 00:21:44,245
who swears he saw Barnett alive
the night they say he died.

392
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:48,384
Mulder, go home.

393
00:21:49,588 --> 00:21:51,021
Get some rest.

394
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,718
There'sjust one thing
that doesn't make sense.

395
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,020
What's that?

396
00:21:55,094 --> 00:21:58,188
Agent Henderson said that note
left at thejewelry store

397
00:21:58,263 --> 00:22:00,458
was written by a right-hander.

398
00:22:00,532 --> 00:22:01,726
Yeah, so?

399
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,768
Well, this inmate at the prison

400
00:22:03,836 --> 00:22:05,804
he swears he saw
Barnett's right hand amputated.

401
00:22:08,273 --> 00:22:11,037
(gurgling)

402
00:22:11,143 --> 00:22:13,509
Reggie, you there?

403
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:14,773
Hey, Reggie.

404
00:22:14,847 --> 00:22:17,509
Reggie? What's going on?

405
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,517
Areyou there?

406
00:22:19,585 --> 00:22:21,849
What the hell's going on?

407
00:22:23,689 --> 00:22:25,486
Reggie, what happened?

408
00:22:25,557 --> 00:22:26,990
Hey, Reggie!

409
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:30,392
Reggie? What's going on?
Areyou there?

410
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:33,897
What the hell's
going on, Reggie?

411
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,038
Hopeyou guys brought
your fine-tooth comb.

412
00:22:41,106 --> 00:22:43,370
I want every piece oflint
collected and analyzed.

413
00:22:43,442 --> 00:22:46,206
Ifnothing turns up,
run it through again.

414
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:47,540
Mulder...

415
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:50,207
His wife died ofcancer
sixyears ago.

416
00:22:50,315 --> 00:22:52,783
Never liked to talk about it.

417
00:22:52,885 --> 00:22:55,149
He was working
on a mystery novel.

418
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,654
He promised to show it to me once,
but he never did.

419
00:22:57,723 --> 00:23:00,817
I think he was afraid
I wouldn't like it.

420
00:23:00,893 --> 00:23:03,157
I'm probably the only guy
on the bureau

421
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:05,025
he trusted enough to even ask.

422
00:23:05,097 --> 00:23:07,861
I'm sorry.

423
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:10,026
I'm just thinking how different
things would have been

424
00:23:10,102 --> 00:23:12,070
ifl would have taken that shot
when I had it.

425
00:23:12,137 --> 00:23:17,234
We're still not
1 00% sure that this is him.

426
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,728
Fresh ink, slightly smeared.

427
00:23:37,796 --> 00:23:40,060
I hate to tell you

428
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:42,566
and I'm not known to be wrong
about these things

429
00:23:42,634 --> 00:23:44,568
but this note
was most certainlywritten

430
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:46,729
by a right-handed person.

431
00:23:46,805 --> 00:23:49,899
You see the pressure points
inside the pen grooves?

432
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:53,069
It's a dead giveaway.

433
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:55,739
Would you be able to tell
ifthis note was written

434
00:23:55,814 --> 00:23:58,248
by somebody using
a prosthetic hand?

435
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:01,616
Well, this fellow...

436
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:04,349
and I'm assuming
from the cursive figures here

437
00:24:04,423 --> 00:24:06,186
that it is a male suspect--

438
00:24:06,258 --> 00:24:09,694
He has a fairly nice,
fuid style.

439
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:11,855
judging from the pressure variations

440
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,524
in the connectors

441
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,626
this person would need
good finger dexterity.

442
00:24:17,703 --> 00:24:20,194
You're not going to get that
with a prosthesis.

443
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:22,604
Soyou think it's the same person
that wrote the first note.

444
00:24:22,674 --> 00:24:24,164
Uh-huh.

445
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:26,677
This the guyyou think
killed Agent Purdue?

446
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:27,677
Yeah.

447
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:29,407
You know what occurred to me?

448
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:34,111
You never got any prints
offthose notes.

449
00:24:34,219 --> 00:24:38,280
Ifthis guywas wearing
a glove on his pen hand

450
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,120
the note wouldn't be smeared
like it is.

451
00:24:41,193 --> 00:24:42,785
Forwhat it's worth.

452
00:24:46,298 --> 00:24:48,232
I wasjust trying to find you.

453
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,895
Listen to this.
According to the A.M.A., Dr. Ridley--

454
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,995
who signed
Barnett's death certificate--

455
00:24:54,072 --> 00:24:57,838
hasn't officially been a doctor
since 1 979.

456
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,502
What doyou mean?

457
00:24:59,578 --> 00:25:01,842
His membership expired
and wasn't renewed

458
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:04,508
after Maryland revoked
his medical license

459
00:25:04,616 --> 00:25:08,484
for research malpractice and
misuse ofa government grant.

460
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:10,021
Where does it say that?

461
00:25:10,122 --> 00:25:11,555
In the federal journal

462
00:25:11,623 --> 00:25:12,988
for the National lnstitute
of Health.

463
00:25:13,058 --> 00:25:14,491
What kind ofresearch?

464
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,824
He was conducting experiments
on young children

465
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:19,227
afficted with a disease
called progeria.

466
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:22,961
Man: The patientyou see
is an eight-year-old girl

467
00:25:23,035 --> 00:25:26,869
suffering from the advanced
stages ofprogeria.

468
00:25:26,939 --> 00:25:28,702
She looks about 90.

469
00:25:28,774 --> 00:25:31,265
Only about 1 00 cases
have ever been reported

470
00:25:31,343 --> 00:25:32,810
so the disease is rare.

471
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:35,540
But fatal.

472
00:25:35,614 --> 00:25:38,583
Some progeria patients
make it to early adulthood

473
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,642
but others become terminal
at age seven or eight.

474
00:25:41,753 --> 00:25:44,187
What's the cause ofdeath?

475
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:45,780
Clinically, it's cardiac

476
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:47,085
or cerebral vascular disease

477
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,093
but actually

478
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:51,686
these poor kids die ofold age.

479
00:25:51,763 --> 00:25:53,993
Is that Dr. Ridley?

480
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:57,001
Yes, in 1 974.

481
00:25:57,069 --> 00:25:58,400
joe Ridley thought

482
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,461
that he could take
their accelerated aging

483
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:02,336
and slow it down.

484
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:03,738
Initially

485
00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:05,834
some ofhis lab work
was promising

486
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:09,005
but then things
got out ofcontrol.

487
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:11,743
He wanted to begin
human trials.

488
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,511
Whywasn't he allowed to?

489
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:16,520
Because he hadn't met
the criteria.

490
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:19,352
It was all too hypothetical,
too dangerous.

491
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:20,891
I mean...

492
00:26:20,993 --> 00:26:22,585
I knewJoe Ridley.

493
00:26:22,661 --> 00:26:24,595
He didn't care about those kids.

494
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:27,257
He talked about them
as iftheywere laboratory animals.

495
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:29,425
This terrible disease, progeria

496
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:32,197
he saw it as
a wonderful opportunity.

497
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:34,535
He used those exact words
with me once.

498
00:26:34,606 --> 00:26:37,803
An opportunity
to "unlock all the secrets."

499
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,674
When they refused
to allow the human trials

500
00:26:40,746 --> 00:26:42,077
he became enraged.

501
00:26:42,147 --> 00:26:45,605
Doyou know what they called
joe Ridley behind his back?

502
00:26:45,684 --> 00:26:47,117
What?

503
00:26:47,185 --> 00:26:49,619
Doktor Mengele.

504
00:26:52,724 --> 00:26:55,090
So, how did Dr. Ridley

505
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,424
eventually lose
his medical license?

506
00:26:57,496 --> 00:26:58,895
He went ahead

507
00:26:58,964 --> 00:27:00,732
with the human trials secretly

508
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:03,562
on an outpatient basis.

509
00:27:03,635 --> 00:27:05,899
When we learned
about it, ofcourse

510
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:07,734
we terminated his grant

511
00:27:07,806 --> 00:27:10,536
and filed charges
with the state medical boards.

512
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:13,305
I'm afraid your colleague,
Dr. Ridley,

513
00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:16,210
has dropped off
the face ofthe earth.

514
00:27:16,281 --> 00:27:17,714
Yeah.

515
00:27:17,783 --> 00:27:20,047
Although it's rumored
he went to South America

516
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:21,415
to continue his work.

517
00:27:25,157 --> 00:27:27,057
Scully:
You don'tjust reverse aging.

518
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:28,319
Ridley's found a way.

519
00:27:28,393 --> 00:27:29,883
Listen to whatyou're saying.

520
00:27:29,962 --> 00:27:32,328
He wanted human
research subjects, right?

521
00:27:32,397 --> 00:27:33,921
Prisoners likeJohn Barnett.

522
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:35,489
It's science fiction.

523
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:37,432
What would you have said
20 years ago

524
00:27:37,502 --> 00:27:39,094
about gene splicing,
DNA fingerprinting

525
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:41,696
cloning, artificial intelligence?

526
00:27:41,773 --> 00:27:44,037
Maybe we're not looking
for a man in his late 40s.

527
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:46,407
MaybeJohn Barnett has found
the perfect disguise--

528
00:27:46,511 --> 00:27:48,172
youth.

529
00:27:53,852 --> 00:27:56,116
Mulder:
I want to age him backwards now.

530
00:27:56,188 --> 00:27:58,156
Let's start with ten years.

531
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:02,726
Now fiveyears more.

532
00:28:02,794 --> 00:28:05,194
And add 20 pounds.

533
00:28:05,263 --> 00:28:07,197
A healthy 20 pounds.

534
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:19,507
Scully: Ridley's notes
from the human trials at N.I.H.

535
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:22,705
indicate he didn't see aging
as inevitable

536
00:28:22,814 --> 00:28:26,250
but as an opportunistic disease.

537
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:29,754
A disease that could be
prevented, reversed even

538
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:32,984
by changing the chemical cues
that trigger certain genes.

539
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:36,494
However, there is
no evidence whatsoever

540
00:28:36,561 --> 00:28:39,155
that Ridley's work
yielded any results

541
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:42,394
or that his theories--
all hope to the contrary--

542
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:44,560
hold anyvalidity.

543
00:28:44,636 --> 00:28:46,228
(creaking)

544
00:28:57,182 --> 00:28:59,548
According to the leading
scientificjournals

545
00:28:59,618 --> 00:29:01,984
projections on this kind
ofgenetic engineering

546
00:29:02,054 --> 00:29:05,114
are at best speculative
and futuristic.

547
00:30:15,494 --> 00:30:17,485
(knocking)

548
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:41,078
(knocking)

549
00:30:45,924 --> 00:30:47,687
Who is it?

550
00:30:49,327 --> 00:30:51,261
Dr.Joe Ridley.

551
00:31:24,262 --> 00:31:26,196
Ifyou're Dr.Joseph Ridley

552
00:31:26,264 --> 00:31:28,698
where haveyou been
for the past fiveyears?

553
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:32,362
I originally continued
my research in Mexico

554
00:31:32,437 --> 00:31:34,371
but for the last threeyears

555
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:36,805
I spent my time
in Central America.

556
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,502
In Belize, to be exact.

557
00:31:38,577 --> 00:31:41,011
What about Barnett?

558
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:42,273
john Barnett

559
00:31:42,347 --> 00:31:44,281
is the only patient left.

560
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:46,408
The only one who survived
the experiments.

561
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:48,577
What aboutyou?

562
00:31:48,653 --> 00:31:50,678
My appearance is deceiving.

563
00:31:50,755 --> 00:31:52,985
I have no more
than a month to live

564
00:31:53,058 --> 00:31:56,323
as I am dying from a rare
cerebral vascular disease.

565
00:31:56,428 --> 00:31:57,861
The same disease

566
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:00,397
that kills the kids
suffering from progeria?

567
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:02,956
That's right.

568
00:32:03,068 --> 00:32:05,730
An unfortunate side effect
ofthe treatment.

569
00:32:05,804 --> 00:32:09,001
By using the genetic components
ofprogeria

570
00:32:09,074 --> 00:32:11,372
I was able to reverse
the aging process

571
00:32:11,443 --> 00:32:13,638
the same way
the disease expedited it.

572
00:32:13,712 --> 00:32:15,873
At the same time,
I and my patients

573
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:17,574
became genetically susceptible

574
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:19,082
to the same ailments

575
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,084
a child ofsix or eight would

576
00:32:21,152 --> 00:32:22,676
ifhe had the disease.

577
00:32:22,754 --> 00:32:24,415
What about Barnett?

578
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:26,980
john Barnett.

579
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:29,652
Ifl didn't so personally
detest the man

580
00:32:29,761 --> 00:32:32,855
I might call him my one triumph.

581
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:34,898
Barnett's not dying?

582
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:38,834
Only his eyes,
which for some reason

583
00:32:38,903 --> 00:32:41,497
do not respond
to the gene therapy.

584
00:32:41,573 --> 00:32:44,633
Otherwise,John Barnett
appears to be thriving.

585
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:47,109
But how?

586
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:50,948
I varied Barnett's treatment.

587
00:32:51,016 --> 00:32:53,450
Once I isolated
the progeria receptors

588
00:32:53,518 --> 00:32:56,453
I stumbled on something
quite unexpected--

589
00:32:56,521 --> 00:32:59,490
this same gene's related
to the production ofmyelin.

590
00:32:59,557 --> 00:33:02,458
The material that insulates
neurons in the body.

591
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:04,518
Yes.

592
00:33:04,596 --> 00:33:07,531
You see, myelin is not present
in the veryyoung

593
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:09,726
and by reversing
the effects ofaging

594
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:11,267
I found with Barnett

595
00:33:11,336 --> 00:33:14,100
I was able to regulate
the production ofmyelin.

596
00:33:14,172 --> 00:33:16,003
Myelin being the material

597
00:33:16,074 --> 00:33:18,201
that prohibits you or I from, say

598
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,369
regenerating a new hand

599
00:33:20,445 --> 00:33:24,472
ifwe were to have ours cut off.

600
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:28,849
You were able
to growJohn Barnett a new hand?

601
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,686
Not exactly.

602
00:33:32,757 --> 00:33:35,191
Not a human hand, anyway.

603
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:39,526
I could never get the cells
to divide or behave properly.

604
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:41,189
I'm afraid to ask.

605
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:44,234
What kind ofhand did you grow?

606
00:33:44,302 --> 00:33:46,065
There had been some successful work

607
00:33:46,137 --> 00:33:47,570
done in London.

608
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:50,870
By taking samples
ofwhat we call cell morphegins

609
00:33:50,942 --> 00:33:52,876
from an amputated salamander arm

610
00:33:52,944 --> 00:33:55,208
and applying them
to the back ofthe creature

611
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,214
theywere able
to grow a new limb

612
00:33:57,282 --> 00:33:59,477
on a different part ofthe body

613
00:33:59,551 --> 00:34:01,451
but only on salamanders.

614
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,111
UntiIJohn Barnett.

615
00:34:03,188 --> 00:34:04,917
Yeah.

616
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:06,820
Unbelievable.

617
00:34:06,891 --> 00:34:09,257
Mywork has cost me dearly.

618
00:34:09,327 --> 00:34:12,728
I'm an outcast
in the medical community.

619
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:15,664
I was called Dr. Mengele,
Dr. Frankenstein

620
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:17,702
but I didn't care.

621
00:34:17,802 --> 00:34:20,737
Becauseyou knew that
ifyour theories panned out...

622
00:34:22,273 --> 00:34:25,936
The man who owns the fountain
ofyouth controls the world.

623
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,342
When the A.M.A. censured me

624
00:34:28,413 --> 00:34:30,779
certain sponsors
came out ofthe woodwork.

625
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:33,545
One ofthem was the U.S. government.

626
00:34:33,618 --> 00:34:35,779
They financed your research?

627
00:34:35,854 --> 00:34:37,788
You might be
more surprised to learn

628
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:41,792
just how high up the ladder
this dirty little secret goes.

629
00:35:01,246 --> 00:35:03,510
I know whyyou've contacted me.

630
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:05,913
Listen and I'll explain.

631
00:35:05,984 --> 00:35:09,147
I am not proud ofthe way
in which this matterwas handled

632
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:13,213
but like it or not,
john Barnett is a fact oflife.

633
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:17,455
I wish Agent Purdue were around
to appreciate the irony.

634
00:35:17,562 --> 00:35:19,189
The government knew full well

635
00:35:19,297 --> 00:35:21,231
that Barnett was in the country.

636
00:35:21,299 --> 00:35:22,789
You, ofcourse, know

637
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:25,267
that Barnett stole
all of Ridley's research.

638
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:27,531
Well, what Ridley doesn't know

639
00:35:27,605 --> 00:35:30,369
is that our government
is bargaining with Barnett

640
00:35:30,442 --> 00:35:32,637
to buy it from him.

641
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:39,141
What does he want?

642
00:35:41,085 --> 00:35:44,521
A lot ofmoney,
immunity, safe haven.

643
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:46,216
Will he get it?

644
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:47,258
(laughing)

645
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:50,624
He holds all the cards.

646
00:35:50,728 --> 00:35:54,027
You're aware
that this freak ofscience

647
00:35:54,098 --> 00:35:56,658
you're negotiating with
is a murderer?

648
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:02,271
The information he has...

649
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,399
could change the course ofmankind.

650
00:36:04,476 --> 00:36:05,909
Consider the options.

651
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:10,511
I will.

652
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:25,996
(phone ringing)

653
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,764
(ringing)

654
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:39,404
Hi. This is Dana Scully.

655
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:41,911
Please leave a message
after the tone.

656
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,572
(beeps)

657
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,775
Electronic voice:
Retrieving messages.

658
00:36:47,151 --> 00:36:50,848
Hi, Dana. It's Mom.
I just wanted to call and say hi.

659
00:36:50,922 --> 00:36:52,514
Give me a call whenever.

660
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,148
Okay, hon. Bye-bye.

661
00:36:54,225 --> 00:36:55,817
Hi, Dana. It's Cathy.

662
00:36:55,894 --> 00:36:58,124
I hopeyou're going to meet me
before my cello recital.

663
00:36:59,864 --> 00:37:01,331
What's that?

664
00:37:01,432 --> 00:37:03,366
It's my private answering machine.

665
00:37:03,434 --> 00:37:05,368
At least it used to be.

666
00:37:05,436 --> 00:37:07,768
This morning, I heard someone

667
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,501
dialing in my private code
and replaying my messages.

668
00:37:10,575 --> 00:37:13,169
Last night
before Dr. Ridley arrived

669
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:15,235
I could have sworn
someone was in my apartment.

670
00:37:15,313 --> 00:37:16,575
When Ridley knocked

671
00:37:16,648 --> 00:37:18,582
I thought I'd mistaken
the noise for him.

672
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:23,587
This morning,
I took this down to Prints.

673
00:37:23,655 --> 00:37:25,589
john Barnett's left index oblique

674
00:37:25,623 --> 00:37:28,023
is on the underside
ofthis unit.

675
00:37:28,092 --> 00:37:29,684
(phone rings)

676
00:37:29,761 --> 00:37:31,058
Mulder.

677
00:37:31,162 --> 00:37:33,892
(moaning)

678
00:37:35,366 --> 00:37:37,732
Barnett?

679
00:37:37,802 --> 00:37:40,396
(groaning)

680
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:43,463
Your new friend, Ridley...

681
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:50,748
Don't grow too fond ofhim, huh?

682
00:37:52,383 --> 00:37:56,615
He's going to die soon
like the rest ofyour friends.

683
00:37:56,688 --> 00:37:58,679
The rest ofmy friends?

684
00:37:58,756 --> 00:38:02,248
One by one.

685
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:04,989
You're not that smart.

686
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:07,826
(chuckles)

687
00:38:07,932 --> 00:38:10,196
Tell me,
you're not going to make me

688
00:38:10,268 --> 00:38:13,431
prove it toyou again, areyou?

689
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,199
Oh, well, no matter.

690
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:18,504
It will beyour turn soon enough.

691
00:38:18,576 --> 00:38:21,909
Well, you won't get that chance.

692
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,141
Oh, no?

693
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:25,807
(laughs)

694
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:29,645
Who's going to stop me, huh?

695
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:34,346
Man, this is...
This is the land ofthe free!

696
00:38:36,928 --> 00:38:40,989
Well, I'm just checking in.

697
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:42,930
Bye.

698
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:44,696
For now.

699
00:38:48,206 --> 00:38:51,664
What does Barnett know
aboutyour phone messages?

700
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:53,973
Uh, that my mother called
for no reason

701
00:38:54,078 --> 00:38:57,070
and I'm meeting a friend
before her cello recital.

702
00:38:57,181 --> 00:38:59,877
Where's that?

703
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:02,784
Mulder:
Before the performance and during

704
00:39:02,854 --> 00:39:04,788
we're working
at a disadvantage

705
00:39:04,856 --> 00:39:07,689
because we don't know exactly
what Barnett looks like.

706
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:09,693
Study each ofthese faces.

707
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:12,195
Know them, particularly the eyes.

708
00:39:12,263 --> 00:39:14,356
I'm including a diagram
ofthe theater.

709
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:17,595
You have six front entrances
and four more backstage.

710
00:39:17,669 --> 00:39:20,604
We know that ifhe shows,
he'll be keying on Scully

711
00:39:20,672 --> 00:39:22,936
so wherever she is,
she should not leaveyour sight.

712
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:25,202
We've got two hours
before the performance.

713
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:27,436
Know this place inside and out.

714
00:39:27,545 --> 00:39:29,479
We don't want any shots fired
ifwe can help it.

715
00:39:29,547 --> 00:39:33,005
We want to take Barnett alive, okay?

716
00:39:34,752 --> 00:39:36,515
Howyou feeling?

717
00:39:36,587 --> 00:39:39,522
It's the first time
I've ever played the target.

718
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,821
Let's make sure
it's not the last time.

719
00:39:42,894 --> 00:39:45,829
(instruments being tuned)

720
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:22,016
Gun!

721
00:41:24,862 --> 00:41:26,523
Down!

722
00:41:32,436 --> 00:41:34,631
Check her out.

723
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:47,746
Stay back, Mulder!

724
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:49,081
Shut up!

725
00:41:49,153 --> 00:41:52,179
Back off, back off.

726
00:41:52,256 --> 00:41:54,656
Don't even think about it.

727
00:41:56,027 --> 00:41:57,961
just let her go.

728
00:41:58,029 --> 00:42:00,429
Go ahead and shoot.

729
00:42:00,498 --> 00:42:01,931
Go ahead, man.

730
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:03,762
Shoot, Mulder.

731
00:42:03,835 --> 00:42:05,803
What areyou afraid of, huh?

732
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:09,135
What, it's against regulations, huh?

733
00:42:09,207 --> 00:42:10,367
No, man.

734
00:42:10,441 --> 00:42:12,409
You need me alive, don'tyou?

735
00:42:12,476 --> 00:42:15,502
'Cause I'm the one
with the research, huh?

736
00:42:15,613 --> 00:42:18,480
So I could shoot her!

737
00:42:18,549 --> 00:42:21,541
And youjust have
to live with it, don'tyou, huh?

738
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:23,018
Shut up!

739
00:42:25,323 --> 00:42:27,291
How about it, Mulder?

740
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:28,791
Woman:
Please.

741
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,192
Barnett:
just like old times, huh?

742
00:42:31,262 --> 00:42:32,593
Huh?

743
00:42:32,663 --> 00:42:34,096
(gunshot)

744
00:42:41,272 --> 00:42:42,671
(screaming)

745
00:42:47,245 --> 00:42:49,543
Call an ambulance!

746
00:42:49,614 --> 00:42:53,880
Man: It's okay, Scully.
An ambulance is on the way.

747
00:42:53,951 --> 00:42:56,715
Easy. You all right?

748
00:43:02,994 --> 00:43:04,928
Don't try to move.

749
00:43:11,068 --> 00:43:13,036
Where are they?

750
00:43:13,104 --> 00:43:15,368
Can you hear me? Barnett.

751
00:43:15,439 --> 00:43:18,602
Where did you hide them?

752
00:43:18,709 --> 00:43:20,734
(all shouting)

753
00:43:21,913 --> 00:43:23,847
How areyou feeling?

754
00:43:23,915 --> 00:43:26,076
Like somebody kicked me
in the ribs.

755
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,118
That bullet went through
eight layers of Kevlar.

756
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:31,120
You're lucky to be alive.

757
00:43:31,188 --> 00:43:33,156
What about him?

758
00:43:33,224 --> 00:43:36,421
They few in three specialists
to try to save his life.

759
00:43:36,494 --> 00:43:39,019
That guy in the ugly suit
is probably C.I.A.

760
00:43:39,096 --> 00:43:41,257
He's been trying to talk to him.

761
00:43:41,332 --> 00:43:42,765
Is Barnett conscious?

762
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:44,858
Yeah, but he's not talking.

763
00:43:49,941 --> 00:43:52,910
Mulder, I know whatyou did
wasn't by the book.

764
00:43:52,977 --> 00:43:56,572
Tells you a lot
about the book, doesn't it?

765
00:44:04,855 --> 00:44:07,050
Barnett!

766
00:44:07,124 --> 00:44:08,887
Come on!

767
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,621
Where are the papers? Come on!

768
00:44:10,695 --> 00:44:12,595
Technician:
Ten! Vitals dropping.

769
00:44:12,663 --> 00:44:13,925
Barnett!

770
00:44:13,998 --> 00:44:15,363
(heart monitor: even tone)

771
00:44:15,433 --> 00:44:16,798
We're gonna hit him.

772
00:44:16,867 --> 00:44:19,267
(all shouting)

773
00:44:19,337 --> 00:44:20,929
Shock him now!

774
00:44:21,005 --> 00:44:23,633
Woman:
It's readywhen you need it.

775
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:25,471
Man:
Stand clear.

776
00:44:26,944 --> 00:44:28,673
Woman:
He's going fast.

777
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:30,212
Scully:
They lost him.

778
00:44:31,749 --> 00:44:34,843
Bastard will take that research
with him to the grave.

779
00:44:36,287 --> 00:44:38,221
Where doyou think it is?

780
00:44:41,392 --> 00:44:43,155
Mulder:
Who knows?

781
00:44:43,227 --> 00:44:46,719
If Barnett didn't destroy it,
he could've stashed it anywhere,

782
00:44:46,797 --> 00:44:49,288
which would have a certain
cruel irony, wouldn't it?

783
00:44:49,367 --> 00:44:52,302
Scientific knowledge that could
change the course ofmankind

784
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:54,634
buried out in a field somewhere

785
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:57,469
or sitting in
some safe deposit box

786
00:44:57,575 --> 00:44:59,736
getting old,
just like the rest ofus.

787
00:44:59,844 --> 00:45:02,074
Scully:
lfhe didn't destroy it, chances are

788
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:04,647
that somehow, someday
somebodywill find it.

789
00:45:04,715 --> 00:45:05,647
(ticking)

790
00:45:05,716 --> 00:45:07,650
Mulder:
And when they do?

791
00:45:07,718 --> 00:45:09,982
Maybe he didn't get his revenge
from beyond the grave

792
00:45:10,054 --> 00:45:12,147
but somehow I feel like

793
00:45:12,223 --> 00:45:14,817
we haven't heard the last
fromJohn Barnett.

794
00:45:14,892 --> 00:45:16,826
(ticking)
