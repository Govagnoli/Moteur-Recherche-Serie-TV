1
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:06,738
We're so sorry, Becky.

2
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:08,740
If there's anything we can do for you,

3
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:10,742
anything at all,
just let us know.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,371
Thank you so much.

5
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,438
That would have meant
a lot to him.

6
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:20,950
Oh, thank you.

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,114
Thank you for coming.

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,928
Mrs. Crouch,

9
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,563
I'm sorry for your loss.

10
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,573
Thank you, Mr...

11
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,609
Johnson.

12
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:45,906
I worked briefly
with your husband.

13
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:52,147
I was impressed by him...
very much so.

14
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,846
Thank you.

15
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,855
Sorry.

16
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,044
Hell of a Christmas,
Raymond.

17
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,277
He's at peace now.

18
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:30,845
That's one small comfort
to be drawn.

19
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:41,295
He didn't even leave
a note.

20
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,901
"I am the resurrection
and the life.

21
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:29,074
"He that believeth in Me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

22
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,414
And whosoever liveth and believeth
in Me shall never die."

23
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,783
"I am the resurrection
and the life.

24
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,414
"He that believeth in Me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

25
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,551
And whosoever liveth and believeth
in Me shall never die."

26
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,562
"I am the resurrection
and the life.

27
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,931
"He that believeth in Me...

28
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:55,802
"though he were dead,
yet shall he live.

29
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:03,805
'And whosoever liveth
and believeth in Me...

30
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,817
shall never die."

31
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:10,347
- "I am the resurrection and the life.

32
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,357
"He that believeth in Me...

33
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:19,494
"though he were dead,
yet shall he live.

34
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,898
"And whosoever liveth
and believeth in Me...

35
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,902
shall never die."

36
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,400
"He that believeth in Me,
though he were dead,

37
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,411
yet shall he live."

38
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,983
- Yeah, four units and...

39
00:05:37,502 --> 00:05:39,436
Thank you, ma'am.

40
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:49,713
- Are you with the F.B.I. too?
- Yes, sir.

41
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:52,272
Look, I know my job.
The man was deceased.

42
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,251
- I'm sorry?
- I understand...

43
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,413
that he was
one of your own.

44
00:05:57,489 --> 00:06:02,017
But these rumors I'm hearing that I put
a living human being into the ground?

45
00:06:02,094 --> 00:06:05,552
You people better get
your facts straight real fast.

46
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:15,595
Mulder? You been
spreading rumors?

47
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:17,938
Why? You hear any
good ones lately?

48
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:20,739
- Not particularly.

49
00:06:20,812 --> 00:06:23,007
So what do you
have here?

50
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:25,015
Merry Christmas,
by the way, Scully.

51
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:28,211
Thank you.
Merry Christmas to you too.

52
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:30,311
Grave robbery
with a twist.

53
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:33,650
Check out the headliner,
Scully.

54
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:39,163
Well, it looks like someone
on the inside was trying to get out.

55
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:41,199
Indeed it does.
And to answer your question,

56
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:43,200
no, I haven't been spreading
any rumors.

57
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:45,828
The local P.D. 's been doing
a pretty good job of that,

58
00:06:45,904 --> 00:06:49,601
ever since they matched the fingerprints
on the dead man to these.

59
00:06:49,674 --> 00:06:53,166
And to those up there
on that headstone.

60
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:55,839
There's a big juicy handprint
on the back.

61
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:03,179
What about the person, or persons,
who did the digging?

62
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:06,713
Well, we've got
one pile of dirt.

63
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:10,559
I'm guessing one man
with a shovel.

64
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:16,697
Other than that, last night's rain
hasn't left us much to go on.

65
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:18,895
Well, go ahead, Scully.
Nay say me.

66
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,404
The body of an F.B.I. agent
gets disinterred,

67
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:24,806
only to climb out on its own
and disappear into the Yuletide night.

68
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:28,573
- See, you had me up until there.
- Did I?

69
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:31,673
I think it's what you said before. I
think it's a grave robbery with a twist.

70
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,413
You've got the fingerprints
and the torn casket liner.

71
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:39,856
Most likely, it's rigged evidence that's
been faked by whoever exhumed the body.

72
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:43,019
- Faked for what effect?
- Publicity.

73
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:46,996
Fear. Rumors. I mean,
I don't know what specific effect,

74
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:49,727
but nonetheless, it's...

75
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:53,862
- What?
- Looks like blood.

76
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:59,773
"And whosoever liveth and believeth
in Me shall never die."

77
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:01,778
"I am the resurrection
and the life.

78
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:03,814
"He that believeth in Me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

79
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:06,407
And whosoever liveth and believeth
in Me shall never die."

80
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:18,652
"I am the resurrection
and the life.

81
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,755
"He that believeth in Me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

82
00:08:20,832 --> 00:08:22,891
And whosoever liveth and believeth
in Me shall never die."

83
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:24,902
"I am the resurrection
and the life."

84
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:38,415
Special Agent Raymond Crouch.

85
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:41,611
Age 56.
Married, no children.

86
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:44,553
After a sterling
21-year career with the Bureau,

87
00:08:44,623 --> 00:08:47,217
he retired in 1993.

88
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:49,556
And then earlier this month,

89
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:51,994
he was found in the garage
of his Tallahassee home,

90
00:08:52,063 --> 00:08:54,896
service weapon in hand.

91
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:57,264
Definitely
self-inflicted?

92
00:08:57,335 --> 00:09:01,465
I read over the report,
and there's no indication otherwise.

93
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:03,404
How about a motive
for the grave robberies?

94
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:05,875
Well, we've gone through all the cases
Crouch had a hand in,

95
00:09:05,944 --> 00:09:08,344
and he doesn't seem
to have made any enemies.

96
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:10,347
Same thing
with his personal life.

97
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:13,578
No large debts,
no feuds with neighbors,

98
00:09:13,652 --> 00:09:15,586
never a bad word
against him.

99
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:19,317
- Nothing stands out?
- Should something stand out?

100
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:22,593
Agent Mulder,
what's your take on this?

101
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:25,789
Well, only that I don't think
it was grave robbery per se.

102
00:09:27,565 --> 00:09:31,296
It was necromancy...
the summoning of the dead.

103
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:36,204
It's a form of magic dating back
to primitive shamanism...

104
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:38,674
with a long tradition
in the Christian Church.

105
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:41,211
Through it, the dead are brought
back to life for the purposes...

106
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,645
of divulging arcane knowledge
or performing ritual tasks.

107
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:46,548
So that's what this wacko thought
he was doing... raising the dead?

108
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:50,611
That's what he was doing.
This is a, uh...

109
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:52,714
That's a magic circle drawn
in goats'blood.

110
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,783
The rain washed
most of it away.

111
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,385
The blood attracts
the spirits of the undead,

112
00:09:58,463 --> 00:10:00,454
while the circle focuses
the necromancer's power...

113
00:10:00,532 --> 00:10:02,796
while protecting him from
the spirits that he's conjuring.

114
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:04,994
Okay.

115
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,699
He may also desire to wear
the clothes of the dead man
to create a bond between them.

116
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,009
You would not want to be
this man's dry cleaner.

117
00:10:12,077 --> 00:10:17,140
Obviously, there are clear
ritualistic elements to this crime.

118
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,150
But the question is, why were
they directed at Raymond Crouch?

119
00:10:20,218 --> 00:10:22,152
That is the question.

120
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:26,213
Well, let's come up
with an answer.

121
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,753
Mulder, Scully,
a word, please?

122
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:42,899
Necromancy aside,
this magic circle you mentioned,

123
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:44,908
what if it looks
something like this?

124
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:50,444
It's an oroboros.
Possibly.

125
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:54,212
Definitely a mystical symbol.
The alchemists favored it.

126
00:10:54,285 --> 00:10:56,515
They believe that it represented
all of existence.

127
00:10:56,588 --> 00:10:58,556
I'm thinking more of
the Millennium Group.

128
00:10:58,623 --> 00:11:02,024
It was their symbol as well.
Are you familiar with them?

129
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:04,027
Yeah, somewhat.
They were, uh,

130
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:08,429
former F.B.I. agents who offered
consulting services to law enforcement.

131
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,593
Somehow,
they fell into disrepute.

132
00:11:10,668 --> 00:11:12,602
They operated in extreme secrecy.

133
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,604
Rumors abounded that they had
their own agenda,

134
00:11:14,672 --> 00:11:18,342
which was less than altruistic,
if not improper or illegal.

135
00:11:18,475 --> 00:11:20,943
That it was, in fact,
a cult based upon...

136
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:23,036
Judeo-Christian End Time
prophecies...

137
00:11:23,113 --> 00:11:25,513
concerning
the coming millennium.

138
00:11:25,582 --> 00:11:28,608
- Was Raymond Crouch a member?
- I can't seem to find out.

139
00:11:28,685 --> 00:11:30,744
Apparently, the group dissolved
several months ago.

140
00:11:30,821 --> 00:11:32,948
They left no paper trail,
nothing.

141
00:11:33,023 --> 00:11:36,481
However,

142
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,927
I do have three other
grave desecrations,
all within the last six months.

143
00:11:44,501 --> 00:11:47,800
Long Island,
Northern California, Arizona.

144
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:51,739
All three graves contained the bodies
of former F.B.I. agents.

145
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:54,800
All three
were recent suicides.

146
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:57,779
How long were you gonna
sit on this?

147
00:11:57,848 --> 00:12:00,646
Owing to the Millennium Group's
former ties with the Bureau,

148
00:12:00,717 --> 00:12:03,447
this matter is sensitive,
to say the least.

149
00:12:05,856 --> 00:12:08,848
Investigate them.
Keep a low profile.

150
00:12:11,161 --> 00:12:13,095
I think I know
where to start.

151
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:19,101
- How well do you know this man?
- Only by reputation.

152
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:22,070
- He left VICAP before I got there.

153
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:26,337
But he's been called
the greatest criminal profiler
that Quantico ever produced.

154
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,072
- What's he doing here?
- Good morning.

155
00:12:29,146 --> 00:12:33,480
Apparently, he, uh, checked
himself in for a 30-day observation.

156
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,451
I gather the last few years
haven't been very kind to him.

157
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,080
But if there's anybody that can tell us
about the Millennium Group, it's him.

158
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:41,386
He used to consult for 'em.
Later, he fought to bring 'em down...

159
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,824
at the expense of his own career
and reputation.

160
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:47,295
- Single-minded.
Sounds like someone I know.
- Yeah.

161
00:12:47,364 --> 00:12:50,390
Twelve yard line.
They are threatening.

162
00:12:50,467 --> 00:12:52,401
Frank Black?

163
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:57,974
Hi, my name is Fox Mulder.
This is my partner, Dana Scully.

164
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:01,977
It's a pleasure to meet you.
You mind if we sit down?

165
00:13:02,045 --> 00:13:04,206
Higgins tries the middle,
and he gets...

166
00:13:04,281 --> 00:13:07,011
- Nowhere!

167
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,917
- Who's playing?
- Uh, it's Notre Dame
and Boston College.

168
00:13:10,987 --> 00:13:13,820
Ah, the Fighting Irish
and the Golden Eagles, huh?

169
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:17,326
What can I do for you,
agents?

170
00:13:18,795 --> 00:13:21,764
Well, we're working
on a case that, uh,

171
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:23,993
we feel that you might have
some particular insight to.

172
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:26,535
The deaths of
four F.B.I. agents.

173
00:13:26,603 --> 00:13:29,094
- Do you recognize these men?
- I do.

174
00:13:33,143 --> 00:13:36,510
All four committed suicide
in the last six months.

175
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:42,717
All were exhumed from their graves
in a ritual desecration.

176
00:13:42,786 --> 00:13:46,745
They were members of the Millennium
Group. Is that correct?

177
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:53,157
Sir, we've been having
a really difficult time...

178
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,222
gleaning any information
whatsoever about the group.

179
00:13:57,501 --> 00:14:00,095
About its membership,
its practices.

180
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,866
I believe you can help us.

181
00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:05,430
No, thank you.
I'm retired.

182
00:14:07,878 --> 00:14:09,937
I think you can tell
by the circumstances...

183
00:14:10,013 --> 00:14:11,947
that I'm trying to put
my life back together.

184
00:14:12,015 --> 00:14:13,949
I can't get involved
in this.

185
00:14:14,017 --> 00:14:15,951
We're not asking you
to get involved.

186
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,112
I'm just asking you to take a look
at the case file.

187
00:14:18,188 --> 00:14:20,122
No, thank you.

188
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:26,822
Mr. Black, the day after tomorrow
is January 1, 2000.

189
00:14:26,897 --> 00:14:29,889
That's the significant date
for these people.

190
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:32,264
That doesn't leave us
much time.

191
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:37,233
Don't you wanna
see them stopped?

192
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,017
Well, Mr. Black,

193
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:51,019
you are not
what I was expecting.

194
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:54,318
- Agent Mulder?
- Yes?

195
00:14:54,391 --> 00:14:57,588
It's first and eighteen.

196
00:14:57,661 --> 00:15:00,095
Just let me
watch this game in peace.

197
00:15:01,398 --> 00:15:04,265
It's third and ten.
Notre Dame.

198
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:06,564
- Happy New Year.
- Same to you.

199
00:15:25,455 --> 00:15:27,423
- Evening.
- Hi.

200
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,651
Could I, uh,
give you a hand?

201
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:31,660
Oh, no, I'm about done.

202
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:34,663
But thanks. Guess I ran over
a nail or something.

203
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:37,632
- Well, I can help you see, at least.
- Yeah.

204
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:40,363
I've been driving all night.
It'll be good to get home.

205
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:42,928
I hear ya.

206
00:15:43,006 --> 00:15:45,907
Man! Whew!

207
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:51,440
- What is that?
- Uh...

208
00:15:51,514 --> 00:15:54,972
I think a deer maybe
must've died out there in the woods.

209
00:15:59,155 --> 00:16:01,419
Sir?

210
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:03,186
What's in the truck?

211
00:16:05,228 --> 00:16:07,355
- Nothing.
- Mind if I take a look?

212
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,364
There's nothing in there,
so...

213
00:16:09,432 --> 00:16:11,992
Drop that,
take two steps back.

214
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:14,903
Drop it.

215
00:16:25,582 --> 00:16:29,780
"And whosoever liveth and believeth
in Me shall never die."

216
00:16:29,853 --> 00:16:31,980
"I am the resurrection
and the life.

217
00:16:32,055 --> 00:16:34,819
"He that believeth in Me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

218
00:16:34,891 --> 00:16:36,882
And whosoever liveth and believeth
in Me shall never die."

219
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:41,958
Oh, Lord.
Stand up there!

220
00:16:42,032 --> 00:16:44,592
Stand up!
Let me see your hands!

221
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:49,297
- What?

222
00:16:49,372 --> 00:16:51,465
Speak up!

223
00:17:23,036 --> 00:17:25,630
Hey.

224
00:17:25,705 --> 00:17:27,764
I've got the men
concentrating on the woods.

225
00:17:27,841 --> 00:17:29,775
Our necromancer
was definitely here.

226
00:17:34,815 --> 00:17:36,783
It's salt.
Heavy magic.

227
00:17:38,518 --> 00:17:40,452
Well, if you're gonna tell me
that he, uh,

228
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,886
stopped by the side of the road
to raise the dead,

229
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:46,255
which I hope you're not,
I've got two things to say to you.

230
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:51,263
One is that his previous circles
were made of blood, not salt. And two...

231
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:53,265
And they were large enough
to contain a body.

232
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,598
This is just a protective circle.
It's just big enough
for one man to stand inside.

233
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,604
Protecting himself
against what?

234
00:17:58,672 --> 00:18:00,765
Whatever it was that did that.

235
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:03,503
Agents!

236
00:18:03,577 --> 00:18:06,137
Over here!

237
00:18:11,418 --> 00:18:14,046
I saw a lump in the ground.

238
00:18:18,258 --> 00:18:19,691
My God.

239
00:18:24,097 --> 00:18:27,191
Bite marks.
They look human.

240
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:28,700
More salt.

241
00:18:41,715 --> 00:18:43,740
"I am he that liveth
and was dead.

242
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:47,082
"And behold, I am alive
for evermore, Amen,

243
00:18:47,153 --> 00:18:49,087
and have the keys
of hell and of death."

244
00:18:51,925 --> 00:18:55,224
Book of Revelations,
chapter 1, verse 18.

245
00:18:56,963 --> 00:18:58,897
Go Fighting Irish.

246
00:19:02,135 --> 00:19:05,036
"First and eighteen. "

247
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:07,573
It's not football.
It's Revelations.

248
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:11,610
You wanted to
tell us something, Frank.

249
00:19:11,678 --> 00:19:13,612
Why don't you just
come out and say it.

250
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,875
I don't know what you're talking about.
I told you.

251
00:19:15,949 --> 00:19:18,042
- I cannot get involved in this.
- Right.

252
00:19:18,118 --> 00:19:21,713
So you'll occasionally drop
the little arcane hint?

253
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,583
A police officer
was murdered, Frank.

254
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:28,127
Why do you want
to play around?

255
00:19:28,194 --> 00:19:30,594
Your denials aside, you obviously
know something about that.

256
00:19:30,664 --> 00:19:34,031
You knew
that we'd find this.

257
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,965
What are you afraid of?

258
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:41,573
Losing your daughter.

259
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:44,735
You're in a custody battle
with the parents of your late wife.

260
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:50,471
I just spoke with your doctor.
That's why you're here.

261
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,348
They claimed I was an unfit father...
that I was obsessed with conspiracy,

262
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,581
the end of the world.

263
00:19:55,655 --> 00:19:58,749
That my work meant more to me
than my daughter, Jordan.

264
00:19:59,893 --> 00:20:03,329
The thing is,
they were right.

265
00:20:05,298 --> 00:20:08,495
- And so you retired.
- I will sell insurance.

266
00:20:08,568 --> 00:20:11,731
I'll do whatever it takes.
I'll get well and jump through
whatever hoops they want,

267
00:20:11,805 --> 00:20:15,639
but I will not mention
the Millennium Group again.

268
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:18,177
But you obviously
want to help.

269
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:21,111
You... dropped
that clue on us.

270
00:20:23,316 --> 00:20:26,752
Look, Frank, nobody
needs to know about this.

271
00:20:28,388 --> 00:20:30,856
We're just three people
sitting around talking.

272
00:20:43,003 --> 00:20:47,440
The Book of Revelations describes
the end of the physical world...

273
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:50,965
in a battle between heaven and hell...
good against evil.

274
00:20:51,044 --> 00:20:55,003
The Millennium Group believed
that that time was upon us.

275
00:20:55,081 --> 00:20:57,379
These four represent
a schism in the group.

276
00:20:59,452 --> 00:21:01,579
They believe that for the End Time
to come as it must,

277
00:21:01,655 --> 00:21:04,954
man must take an active hand
in bringing that about.

278
00:21:05,025 --> 00:21:08,153
- And to that end,
they committed suicide?
- Yeah.

279
00:21:08,228 --> 00:21:10,856
With the express purpose
of being brought back to life.

280
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,797
The four horsemen
of the apocalypse.

281
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:15,835
These four men
bring with them...

282
00:21:15,902 --> 00:21:17,961
war, pestilence,
famine and death.

283
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:20,370
So that all the dead of the earth
will rise.

284
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,670
Armageddon.

285
00:21:22,742 --> 00:21:27,008
It must begin with the dawn
of the millennium, or not at all.

286
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,014
That's what they believe.

287
00:21:31,217 --> 00:21:33,344
The man you're looking for,
your necromancer,

288
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,912
he exhumed these men
in accordance with their wishes.

289
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,016
- So is he a member of
the Millennium Group as well?
- No.

290
00:21:40,093 --> 00:21:41,924
They sought him out.

291
00:21:41,995 --> 00:21:44,361
He believes he's doing
God's work.

292
00:21:44,431 --> 00:21:46,399
But he's mistaken.

293
00:21:46,466 --> 00:21:48,525
Could you tell us
a little bit more about this man?

294
00:21:48,601 --> 00:21:51,661
Well, he's a white male,
45 to 50.

295
00:21:51,738 --> 00:21:54,229
He's a religious man.
No police record.

296
00:21:54,307 --> 00:21:56,537
No fulfilling relationship.

297
00:21:56,609 --> 00:21:59,407
You would pass him
without giving him a glance.

298
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:02,414
So this is the one event
that will give his life meaning?

299
00:22:02,482 --> 00:22:04,416
Yeah.

300
00:22:04,484 --> 00:22:08,545
He needs privacy for this.
He'll live alone.

301
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:10,555
Possibly in the house
he grew up in.

302
00:22:10,623 --> 00:22:15,617
Most likely it's a large,
rural property away from prying eyes.

303
00:22:15,695 --> 00:22:18,926
He'll own a truck or a van.
He needs it to transport the bodies.

304
00:22:18,998 --> 00:22:22,900
There'll be high fences,
"No Trespassing"signs.

305
00:22:22,969 --> 00:22:25,403
It's a solitary existence.

306
00:22:25,472 --> 00:22:28,006
He's worked around death
all his life in some capacity.

307
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:31,199
A funeral parlor
or a cemetery.

308
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:34,642
- Death comforts him.
A Rice County deputy missing...

309
00:22:34,712 --> 00:22:38,614
He took great care in burying
the deputy, in preparing the body,

310
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:41,345
despite the fact that
he feared being caught.

311
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:44,183
He stapled the lips,
sealed the mouth shut.

312
00:22:44,255 --> 00:22:46,553
It was to prevent the man
from coming back to life.

313
00:22:46,624 --> 00:22:51,527
He believes that if disturbed,
the deputy will rise from the dead.

314
00:22:51,596 --> 00:22:53,928
It's too soon for that,
which is why...

315
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,296
when he realizes the deputy
has been discovered,

316
00:22:56,367 --> 00:22:58,733
he'll feel a need
to take action.

317
00:22:58,803 --> 00:23:01,067
He'll return to the body
the first chance he gets.

318
00:23:01,139 --> 00:23:03,300
Rice County Morgue.

319
00:23:03,374 --> 00:23:05,308
I think
you'll catch him there.

320
00:23:05,376 --> 00:23:08,470
These four members of
the Millennium Group,

321
00:23:08,546 --> 00:23:10,605
the ones that
"truly liveth who are dead,"

322
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:14,139
there are the ones
we have to catch.

323
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:16,482
- Mr. Black?
- Yeah?

324
00:23:16,554 --> 00:23:18,647
You've got a phone call.
I think it might be your daughter.

325
00:23:18,723 --> 00:23:21,920
Thank you.
My daughter. Excuse me.

326
00:23:27,498 --> 00:23:29,432
Mulder, you're telling me
it's more important...

327
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,434
to track down four dead bodies
than one live murderer?

328
00:23:31,502 --> 00:23:34,403
He's not our murderer,
and those four dead bodies aren't dead.

329
00:23:34,472 --> 00:23:36,667
- And the millennium is 14 hours away.

330
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:38,675
Mulder, these people,
even when they were alive,

331
00:23:38,743 --> 00:23:42,770
mangled Biblical prophecy
to the extent that it's unrecognizable.

332
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:45,407
And the year 2000 is just
their artificial deadline.

333
00:23:45,483 --> 00:23:49,613
And besides, 2001 is actually
the start of the new millennium.

334
00:23:49,687 --> 00:23:51,882
Nobody likes
a math geek, Scully.

335
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:54,550
Anyway, I think that
Frank's profile is sound.

336
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,616
- I do too.
- And I think with it,

337
00:23:56,694 --> 00:23:59,390
we have the best chance of finding
this necromancer, as you call him.

338
00:24:00,765 --> 00:24:03,233
So I'm going down
to the county morgue.

339
00:24:03,301 --> 00:24:06,702
- I absolutely think you should.
- And what are you gonna do?

340
00:24:06,771 --> 00:24:09,239
Follow the profile.
The deputy was killed...

341
00:24:09,307 --> 00:24:11,832
on a road that connects
from the north with no major highway.

342
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:14,309
I'm thinking our necromancer
lives nearby.

343
00:24:14,378 --> 00:24:18,508
I'm gonna do a rundown on all
single landowners in the area,
see where the bodies are buried.

344
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:21,984
Oh, Scully,
will you do me a favor?

345
00:24:22,053 --> 00:24:25,716
Don't let anybody remove the staples
from the deputy's mouth, okay?

346
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,724
Please? Just humor me?
Thanks.

347
00:24:47,345 --> 00:24:49,677
Proceeding with the visual
examination of the mouth.

348
00:24:56,521 --> 00:24:58,455
Geez.

349
00:25:03,194 --> 00:25:06,857
- What appears to be salt...

350
00:25:06,931 --> 00:25:09,923
is packed into
the victim's mouth.

351
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:12,902
- God only knows why.

352
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,871
I'm removing it.

353
00:25:37,595 --> 00:25:39,529
You've reached Rice County Morgue.

354
00:25:39,597 --> 00:25:41,531
No one can come to the phone.

355
00:25:46,704 --> 00:25:49,298
This is
Agent Dana Scully with the F.B.I.

356
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:53,901
Please do not autopsy the murder
victim that was brought in
earlier... the sheriffs deputy.

357
00:25:53,978 --> 00:25:56,776
If you've already started,
stop now.

358
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:59,782
I'll be there shortly,
and I'll explain when I arrive.

359
00:26:08,726 --> 00:26:10,660
Hello?

360
00:27:47,923 --> 00:27:49,857
Where is she?

361
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,477
Sir?

362
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:25,893
How you feeling?

363
00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:29,063
All things considered?

364
00:28:29,131 --> 00:28:32,498
What the hell happened here?
Who is that man?

365
00:28:32,568 --> 00:28:35,401
The sheriff s deputy.

366
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:37,803
The man we found
this morning.

367
00:28:37,873 --> 00:28:39,807
He was dead.

368
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:41,809
And then somehow,
he wasn't.

369
00:28:41,877 --> 00:28:43,811
He attacked me.

370
00:28:43,879 --> 00:28:46,643
You shot him?

371
00:28:46,716 --> 00:28:49,810
Three rounds, center of mass
into his chest.

372
00:28:49,885 --> 00:28:51,819
No effect.

373
00:28:55,124 --> 00:28:57,319
There's a gunshot wound
to his head as well.

374
00:28:57,393 --> 00:28:59,327
Yeah, this man, uh,

375
00:28:59,395 --> 00:29:03,957
Mulder calls the necromancer,
our suspect, he was here too.

376
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,228
He fired that shot
with my gun.

377
00:29:07,503 --> 00:29:09,664
He saved me.
I have no idea why.

378
00:29:09,739 --> 00:29:13,470
He got away,
but I was in no shape to follow.

379
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:15,703
Look, sir,

380
00:29:15,778 --> 00:29:19,407
I can't even begin to offer
an explanation for what happened.

381
00:29:20,983 --> 00:29:24,009
But I have to say
it is exactly what Mulder feared.

382
00:29:24,086 --> 00:29:28,216
Yeah, which is why
I would like to talk to him.
Why isn't he answering his phone?

383
00:29:59,555 --> 00:30:02,149
Well, welcome
to the boondocks.

384
00:31:09,225 --> 00:31:13,457
In the sweet
by and by

385
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:17,488
We will meet on
that beautiful shore

386
00:32:55,295 --> 00:32:58,458
Hey! Open the door!
Open the door!

387
00:32:58,532 --> 00:33:00,500
Open up!
Let me out!

388
00:33:00,567 --> 00:33:02,762
Hey!

389
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,201
I haven't heard from him.
He didn't go to the morgue with you?

390
00:33:10,277 --> 00:33:12,745
No, he went looking
for our suspect's home.

391
00:33:12,813 --> 00:33:15,213
No one's been able
to contact him since.

392
00:33:15,282 --> 00:33:19,412
I've got task force agents canvassing
the northwestern Maryland area,

393
00:33:19,486 --> 00:33:23,582
but it's a large territory to cover,
and we're running out of time.

394
00:33:25,626 --> 00:33:30,222
Sir, I'm just afraid that Mulder
may have found what he's looking for.

395
00:33:31,465 --> 00:33:33,399
I need your help
in finding him.

396
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:38,097
Now, you respected my reasons
in the past, Agent Scully.
Please respect them now.

397
00:33:38,172 --> 00:33:41,573
I'm not sure that
I really understand your reasons, sir.

398
00:33:41,642 --> 00:33:45,237
And I'm starting to wonder
what this is all about,
and how much you know about it.

399
00:33:47,448 --> 00:33:50,508
Mulder mentioned the four
Millennium members...

400
00:33:50,584 --> 00:33:52,779
"who liveth and were dead."

401
00:33:54,388 --> 00:33:57,118
Now, this morning in the morgue,
I saw what he was talking about.

402
00:33:57,191 --> 00:33:58,920
You did?

403
00:33:59,993 --> 00:34:01,927
One of them attacked me.

404
00:34:01,995 --> 00:34:04,088
I'm sorry.

405
00:34:04,164 --> 00:34:06,928
Now, as crazy as this sounds,
I have to ask.

406
00:34:09,703 --> 00:34:11,933
Do you believe that
the Millennium Group...

407
00:34:12,005 --> 00:34:15,406
is actually capable of
bringing about the End Time?

408
00:34:17,177 --> 00:34:19,941
Armageddon?

409
00:34:21,281 --> 00:34:23,306
I understand their beliefs.

410
00:34:23,383 --> 00:34:25,613
I've spent years
trying to unravel them,

411
00:34:25,686 --> 00:34:28,280
make sense of them.

412
00:34:28,355 --> 00:34:30,482
It doesn't mean
I believe them myself.

413
00:34:30,557 --> 00:34:33,685
But what if it were true?

414
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,924
Good and evil...
Which would prevail?

415
00:34:39,132 --> 00:34:41,157
I'm sorry.

416
00:34:51,578 --> 00:34:53,637
Octavia?

417
00:34:53,714 --> 00:34:55,682
I'm gonna check myself out.

418
00:34:55,749 --> 00:34:59,276
- You'd like a day pass?
- I won't be coming back.

419
00:35:35,088 --> 00:35:37,022
Who's there?

420
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:41,086
- It's me.
- You came.

421
00:35:42,896 --> 00:35:44,830
I almost didn't.

422
00:35:44,898 --> 00:35:48,561
We'd given up on you.
Thank God.

423
00:35:48,635 --> 00:35:51,661
Thank God.

424
00:35:51,738 --> 00:35:54,832
There's someone in the basement.
A policeman.

425
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,605
He killed
one of the members.

426
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:00,613
He shot him in the head.

427
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,714
But you're here.

428
00:36:05,786 --> 00:36:07,720
Now we'll have four.

429
00:36:07,788 --> 00:36:09,722
I'm here.

430
00:36:18,364 --> 00:36:20,298
I can't tell you
how happy I am.

431
00:36:20,366 --> 00:36:23,995
You were meant to be the fourth.
I always knew that.

432
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:27,163
- I so hoped you'd come around.
- I didn't want to.

433
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:30,868
The man in the basement...
I told him how to find this place.

434
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:35,707
You... Why?

435
00:36:35,781 --> 00:36:37,976
I was trying to walk
the straight and narrow,

436
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,984
leave the Millennium Group
behind.

437
00:36:40,052 --> 00:36:42,520
But I know
I can't do that anymore,

438
00:36:42,588 --> 00:36:44,522
now that I know
you've succeeded.

439
00:36:45,691 --> 00:36:47,625
You didn't believe
the dead would arise.

440
00:36:47,693 --> 00:36:51,493
- No.
- You see what the future holds, Frank.

441
00:36:51,563 --> 00:36:53,827
You know you can't
run from it.

442
00:36:53,899 --> 00:36:55,833
No, I can't run.

443
00:36:55,901 --> 00:37:00,964
You've paid so dearly.
They've taken your daughter from you,

444
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:02,973
murdered your wife.

445
00:37:04,743 --> 00:37:06,904
There's no justice
in this world.

446
00:37:18,924 --> 00:37:20,858
But there will be
in the next.

447
00:37:25,998 --> 00:37:27,932
The hour is near.

448
00:37:29,601 --> 00:37:31,535
Are you ready, Frank?

449
00:37:33,939 --> 00:37:35,873
I'm ready.

450
00:37:40,746 --> 00:37:43,840
"I am the resurrection
and the life.

451
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:46,680
He that believeth in Me,
though he were dead..."

452
00:37:46,752 --> 00:37:48,720
"...yet shall he live.

453
00:37:48,787 --> 00:37:51,517
And whosoever liveth and believeth
in Me shall never die."

454
00:38:01,033 --> 00:38:03,001
- Scully.
- This is Skinner.

455
00:38:03,068 --> 00:38:05,229
We back-checked Frank Black
as you asked.

456
00:38:05,304 --> 00:38:08,296
- And?
- He took no calls
at Hartwell Psychiatric...

457
00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:10,307
other than from his daughter.

458
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:12,639
But the staff took messages,
including one from a Rice County number.

459
00:38:12,711 --> 00:38:14,576
Rice County?
That's where I am right now.

460
00:38:14,646 --> 00:38:17,479
We ran the phone records
for Agent Crouch and the other
desecration victims.

461
00:38:17,549 --> 00:38:20,575
All four received calls from this same
number in the weeks before their deaths.

462
00:38:20,652 --> 00:38:22,483
I'm gonna need an address.

463
00:38:22,554 --> 00:38:24,852
Don't do this.
I'm begging you, please.

464
00:38:24,923 --> 00:38:28,359
You know what the world is.
Evil goes unpunished.

465
00:38:28,427 --> 00:38:32,830
The good suffer. There's no future here
but uncertainty and pain.

466
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:38,027
Let the judgment come!

467
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:42,705
- You're damning yourself, Frank!
- Agent Mulder?

468
00:38:45,944 --> 00:38:47,878
Can you hear me?

469
00:38:49,281 --> 00:38:53,047
- Agent Mulder?
-  Yeah. I'm down here.

470
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,911
They're all around.

471
00:39:14,473 --> 00:39:17,636
- You armed?
- Oh, yeah.

472
00:39:17,709 --> 00:39:21,110
Shoot for the head. That seems
to stop 'em. There's three more of'em.

473
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:23,977
- Where?
- I don't know. They're hiding.

474
00:39:56,682 --> 00:39:59,412
- Mulder, can you get up?
- Uh, I think so.

475
00:40:01,219 --> 00:40:02,488
- Look out!

476
00:40:02,488 --> 00:40:03,420
- Look out!

477
00:41:01,446 --> 00:41:03,414
Well, there's another shot...

478
00:41:03,482 --> 00:41:07,009
of that beautiful millennium
crystal ball all lit up.

479
00:41:07,085 --> 00:41:09,349
And they're getting ready
to bring in the new year.

480
00:41:09,421 --> 00:41:11,389
Boy, are they
packed in tonight.

481
00:41:11,456 --> 00:41:14,289
The body heat alone is keeping 'em warm.
And look at 'em,

482
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:16,554
all the way up past
52nd Street.

483
00:41:16,628 --> 00:41:19,188
That is that X-shaped thing
I was talking about before.

484
00:41:19,264 --> 00:41:22,700
This is Times Square...
the crossroads of the world.

485
00:41:22,768 --> 00:41:25,168
- Mr. Black.
- Hey.

486
00:41:25,237 --> 00:41:28,729
MarkJohnson's been taken
for psychiatric evaluation.

487
00:41:28,807 --> 00:41:31,503
He'll be put under suicide watch,
just as you asked.

488
00:41:31,577 --> 00:41:34,410
- Good.

489
00:41:34,479 --> 00:41:37,937
- And, um...
- What?

490
00:41:38,016 --> 00:41:40,246
There's someone here
to see you.

491
00:41:43,055 --> 00:41:45,523
- Hi, Daddy!
- Hi ya, little one.

492
00:41:46,992 --> 00:41:48,721
Wow.

493
00:41:48,794 --> 00:41:52,195
- Oh, I missed you, sweetheart.
- I missed you too, Daddy.

494
00:42:04,643 --> 00:42:06,577
Let's get out of here.

495
00:42:08,447 --> 00:42:12,042
Frank, good luck
with everything.

496
00:42:12,117 --> 00:42:15,609
Agent Mulder, Agent Scully.
I guess this is it, huh?

497
00:42:18,056 --> 00:42:21,890
- You're not gonna stay and watch?
- No, we just wanna go home.

498
00:42:22,961 --> 00:42:24,895
Take care of yourselves.

499
00:42:24,963 --> 00:42:27,454
Thirty seconds now. Get ready...

500
00:42:27,532 --> 00:42:30,000
for the loudest cheering
you'll ever hear in your whole life.

501
00:42:30,068 --> 00:42:33,504
Hug your friends and loved ones tight,
and whoever that person is next to you.

502
00:42:33,572 --> 00:42:36,200
No time like the present.
Are you ready? Here we go.

503
00:42:36,274 --> 00:42:39,607
Ten, nine, eight,

504
00:42:39,678 --> 00:42:42,169
seven, six, five,
