It's in the back.

His name was Isaac Luria.

17
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,560
He lived in the Williamsburg
section of Brooklyn.

18
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,480
Home to a sect of Hasidic Jews who've
lived there since the late 1 9th century.

19
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,520
It's an area also known for its history
of racial tension and hate crimes--

20
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,600
- Yankel Rosenbaum, Tawana Brawley--
- And now Isaac Luria.

21
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,400
He was murdered two days ago
in the market that he owned.

22
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,640
Severely beaten and shot
five times at point-blank range.

23
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,160
Police ruled out robbery 'cause the only
thing missing was this videotape...

24
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,760
from the surveillance camera.

25
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,560
- Police found it early this morning.
- Where ?

26
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,040
In the V.C.R. of a 1 6 year old
named Tony Oliver.

27
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,760
- [Turns On TV]
- That's him on the upper right.

28
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,920
Has he been arrested?

29
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,640
No, because he's dead.

30
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,200
Apparently he'd been watching this
tape when he was strangled to death.

31
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,240
- Very Old Testament.
- Yeah, but with a new twist.

32
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,760
The Brooklyn homicide detectives
contacted the F.B.I.'s
civil rights branch...

33
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,320
with an interesting set of fingerprints
that they pulled off of the boy's body.

34
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,880
- Interesting how ?
- Interesting in that they
belonged to Isaac Luria.

35
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,880
Risen from the grave
to avenge his own death ?

36
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,960
Some people might assume that.
It's probably what someone
would like us to think.

37
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,400
- But you have your own idea.
- I think this is a crime of hatred,

38
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,320
like the crime that spawned it.

39
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,000
A hatred that goes back
4,000years.

40
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,800
But masquerading
as something else here...

41
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,320
and a callow attempt
at murderous retribution...

42
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,800
disguised as spectral justice.

43
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,080
- A resurrection hoax ?
- And not a very good one.

44
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,120
Spectral figures are not often known
to leave fingerprints. Casper never did.

45
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,800
Somehow the killer got a hold
of Isaac Luria's fingerprints.

46
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,040
And we have been asked
to prove how.

Excuse me, sir.

We'd like to speak
with Ariel Luria.

50
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,800
- Is she home ?
- I'm Ariel's father, Jacob Weiss.

51
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,880
Why are you bothering her again ?
She's already spoken with the police.

52

It's all right. Let them in.

Thank you.

55
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,080
We can talk
in the study.

56
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,440
This is why you are here ?

57
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,120
This is what you come to ask
in this house of mourning ?

58
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,880
- What is this ?
- We would like your permission
to reopen Isaac's grave.

59
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,360
No! The answer's no!

60
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,640
[Ariel]
Why does this have to be done ?

61
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,880
We're looking for evidence in the murder
of this man. His name is Tony Oliver.

62
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,520
He is one of three suspects
in the murder of your husband.

63
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,640
We believe it was an act of retaliation
and the other two suspects are targets.

64
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,200
- He’s just a boy.
- He's an animal.

65
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,680
A monster, just like the others
who killed Isaac--

66
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,680
whose grave you're asking us to
desecrate so you can now protect them.

67
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,920
- Tata, please.
- But where were you when Isaac
needed your protection ?

68
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,960
When we called the police,
they said that we were paranoid.

69
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,040
That there was nothing
to worry about.

70
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,360
They always say that
when someone threatens the Jews.

71
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,720
So there was a specific
threat of violence ?

72
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,720
The threat is always there.

73
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,320
Just this morning...
this is what I found under our door.

74
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,360
And now you've come here
not to help us,

75
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,720
but to ask our help so you
can impose your justice...

76
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,080
on the only man who's taken
justice into his own hands.

77
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,960
We would be happy not to
disturb the grave site if you
could tell us who that man is.

78
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,760
Even if I knew,
why would I tell you ?

79
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,120
Because this is
a homicide investigation, sir,

80
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,960
and you are required by law
to assist us.

81
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,200
I know all about
your laws.

82
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,320
Sir, I'm afraid that even
without your consent,

83
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,440
we can get a court order
to exhume Isaac’s grave.

84
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,400
Do what you feel
is necessary.

85
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,960
But leave us alone.
Let us mourn in peace.

86
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,160
I have a feeling he knows
who killed Tony Oliver, Mulder.

87
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,760
I think he doesn't want us
disturbing Luria's grave because
he knows what we'll find.

88
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:48,000
Maybe. But it's hard to fault
his attitude when you see
something like that.

89
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,240
And anybody delivering justice
to a people who have known that
kind of persecution and hatred,

90
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,680
- why wouldn’t they protect them ?
-Justice or revenge ?

91
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,680
I'm not saying those kids don't warrant
full prosecution under the law,

92
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,680
but the hate mongering
goes both ways.

93
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,000
But the right to free expression
doesn't extend to murder.

94
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,240
I bet whoever published that
knows the boys who killed Isaac Luria...

95
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,320
and probably has a good idea
who killed Tony Oliver too.

96
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,360
Sure I knew him. The man owned
the store right across the street.

97
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,080
- But I'd be lying if I said
I was surprised it happened.
- Why is that ?

98
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,880
Well, you know
how they are.

99
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,920
They're always trying to find
ways to make money off of honest
folk who work for a living.

100
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,880
Can you think of anyone
who might have held a grudge ?

101
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,400
- I can't think of anyone who didn't.
- Did you ?

102
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,200
Why ? I'm not under any kind
of suspicion, am I ?

103
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,920
No, not directly,
but these young men are.

104
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,600
We have reason to believe
you know them.

105
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,960
Their names are Derek Banks
and Clinton MacGuire.

106
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,960
I'm sorry. I'm not
familiar with them.

107
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,520
Well, are you familiar
with this ?

108
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,760
We think those kids
are familiar with it.

109
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,560
Enough to incite them
to the murder of Isaac Luria.

110
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,320
- You work for them too, don’t you ?
- Who ?

111
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,480
You know who. You look like
you might be one yourself.

112
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,760
We work for the F.B.I., sir.

113
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,280
Who's the F.B.I. work for ?
That's right.

114
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,800
You call me paranoid, 'cause that's
exactly what they want you to do.

115
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,800
But there is one thing you can't call me
and that is a Zionist collaborator.

116
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,560
You take along look
at these photos.

117
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,040
It may be your last chance
to save their lives.

118
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,280
One of their accomplices,
a young man named Tony Oliver,
was found murdered this morning.

119
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,920
- Why are you telling me this ?
- You haven't heard the rumors ?

120
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,440
- What rumors ?
- That Luria is back from the dead.

121
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,080
That he’s risen
from his grave.

122
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,800
What kind of Jew trick
is this ?

123
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,440
A Jew pulled it off
2,000 years ago.

124
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,000
We’re just relating the evidence, sir.
You can draw your own conclusions.

125
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,880
But I know you wouldn't
want to be responsible for...

126
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,320
endangering these
young men's lives.

127
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,560
Bless you.

128
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,680
Derek ?

129
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,720
Are you sure about this ?

130
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,440
I heard them, man. I'm not waiting
around to find out if it’s true.

131
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,360
- [ Grunts ] Damn !
- What's wrong ?

132
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,280
- It's nailed shut.
- There's some tools in the trunk.

133
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,240
- [ Gasping ]
- [ Grunting ]

134
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,520
I got it open, man !
Get down here.

135
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,400
Hey, Clinton.
Check it out.

136
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,200
Clinton.

137
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,760
Hey, Clinton.
Check it out.

138
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,680
Clinton ?

139
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,280
You trying
to mess with me ?

140
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,280
[ Gasping ]
Oh, man.

141
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,480
The ligature marks on the victim's neck
are consistent with our vigilante’s M.O.

142
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560
Forensics come up
with anything ?

143
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,960
Yeah, a second set of footprints,
but the mud was too soft to take a mold.

144
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,880
- My guess is Clinton
was here with Derek Banks.
- Looking for what ?

145
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,360
Maybe they came to desecrate the corpse
as retribution for Tony Oliver's death.

146
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,440
That seems pretty redundant,
doesn't it ? Messing up
somebody you’ve already killed ?

147
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,920
- I think they came here
because they were afraid.
- Afraid ?

148
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,880
Afraid that the man they hated
enough to kill wasn't really dead.

149
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,920
Look.

150
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,120
There goes your theory of how
Luria's fingerprints found their
way onto the victim's body.

151
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,160
What does that
look like to you ?

152
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,080
Well, the body wasn’t embalmed,
as according to custom.

153
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,400
Maybe it's postmortem lividity
or some kind of tattooing.

154
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,080
It's hard to tell
at this stage of decomposition.

155
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,600
What's this ?

156
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,600
A little bedtime reading ?

157
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,480
- [Derek] You owe me for two weeks.
- Where have you been ?

158
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,080
Is it true ?
You and your friends killed the Jew ?

159
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,320
-Just give me my money.
- What the hell were you thinking ?

160
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,160
I never told you to kill anyone.
I never said to do that.

161
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,920
No ? What did you
expect me to do ?

162
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,040
Hide back here like you,

163
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,040
licking envelopes in the dark,
calling them names ?

164
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,560
- We're working to spread the truth.
- The truth ?

165
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,760
Man, you're as pathetic
as they are.

166
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,600
What ? I am exposing
their lies.

167
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,720
Man, those are just words.

168
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,520
You think they killed
my friends with words ?

169
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,600
That's right.
Clinton's dead too.

170
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,960
Now I'd like my money.

171
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,080
It's called the Sefer Yezirah,
the Book of Creation.

172
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,480
The earliest known Hebrew text on man's
mystical communion with the Divine.

173
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,240
- Is it ever buried with the dead ?
- No.

174
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,960
In observance with Jewish belief
that with death comes equality,

175
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,080
the corpse is buried
only in its shroud.

176
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,440
No personal symbols of class
or worldly position are allowed.

177
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,080
Has it ever been known
to spontaneously combust ?

178
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,080
Uh, no.
No, it hasn't.

179
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,400
It's a book on mysticism,
not mysticism itself.

180
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,880
Is it printed on any special paper
or with any special ink ?

181
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,640
No, it’s just a book.
Leather and paper.

182
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,400
Now, I suspect somebody
might be trying to play a trick on you.

183
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,320
There is possibility that moisture
may have leeched into the coffin,

184
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,000
into the binding
and the pages of the book.

185
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,520
If the ground water
was contaminated,

186
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,160
arsenic or arsine gas could have
created a combustible mixture.

187
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,200
Is there anything that
distinguishes this particular
Sefer Yezirah from other books ?

188
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,760
Yes, but it's barely legible
because of the burning.

189
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,440
It's a name engraved in the leather,
or stamped into the leather.

190
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,320
- A name ?
- Yes, a Hebrew name. Weiss.

191
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,160
Jacob Weiss.

192
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,320
Jacob Weiss.

193
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,800
- Why do you want to see him ?
- There's been another murder.

194
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,520
Another suspect in your husband's death
has been found dead last night.

195
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,040
- Where was this ?
- It was next to your husband's grave.

196
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,360
How does this concern
my father ?

197
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,360
Yesterday he expressed some strong
feelings towards this latest victim.

198
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,720
He was angry.
They were just angry words.

199
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,000
And we found evidence
placing him at the crime scene.

200
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,920
This is escalating
into something else, Ariel.

201
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,920
Something that has to stop.

202
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,960
My marriage to Isaac,

203
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,360
you have to understand how much
it would have meant to my father.

204
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,560
What do you mean,
"would have meant" ?

205
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,960
We got our marriage license a few weeks
ago, but the wedding wasn't until today.

206
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,720
I'm sorry.

207
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,000
I’d like to
show you something.

208
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,920
It was a communal wedding ring
made in Kolin,

209
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,720
a village near Prague.

210
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,200
My father was an apprentice
to the man who designed it.

211
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,480
- It's beautiful.
- Mm-hmm.

212
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:02,440
Everywoman who got married
in the synagogue wore this ring
as a symbol that...

213
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,440
she was a queen,

214
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,640
her husband a king,

215
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,720
and the home they made a castle,
not only on their wedding day,

216
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,440
but for the rest
of their lives together.

217
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,600
But most of those lives ended
in one day in thespringof1943.

218
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,760
Nine thousand Jews were massacred
after digging their own graves.

219
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,640
But your father survived.

220
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,520
Because he was ten years old,
and he was a jeweler’s apprentice.

221
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,800
He had small fingers to make
bullets at a munitions factory.

222
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,760
And through all this
he hid the ring ?

223
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,440
Even after the war, he hid it.
Even from my mother.

224
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,360
Why ?

225
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,560
Because to him it was a dead relic
from a forgotten place,

226
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,120
until the day that I told him
I was getting married.

227
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,000
And for the first time in 50 years,
he took out this ring.

228
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,760
He said he felt
his village was born again.

229
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,440
He knew how much
I loved Isaac.

230
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,360
Ariel, tell us
where your father is.

231
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,520
I know my father.
He would never kill anyone.

232
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,560

Where is he ?
Where's my father?

249
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,920
We've arrested him, Ariel,
under suspicion of murder.

250
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,920
I don't believe you.
It can't be him.

251
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,840
Did he-- Did he tell you
he killed this person ?

252
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,680
I think that's the direction it's going.
Agent Mulder's in there with him now.

253
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,520
- I need to see him.
- Ariel, I suggest that
you get him an attorney.

254
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,840
He's refusing
legal representation.

255
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,560
I need to see him.

[ Sighs ]
Okay.

257
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,320
You can ask Detective Bartley
down the hall.

He'll give you a place to wait until
your father's been processed.

I'm sorry.

00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,560
Why'd you kill him, Jacob ?

262
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:11,000
Our synagogue has been vandalized
1 3 times in the last year.

263
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,800
I heard a noise
in the attic.

264
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,400
I went up to see what it was,
and he attacked me. It was self-defense.

265
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,640
- Hanging a man in self-defense ?
- Is it any worse than
what they did to Isaac ?

266
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,400
Is it any better ?

267
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,000
They found your book, your Sefer Yezirah
in Isaac Luria's grave.

268
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,160
- So ?
- That puts you at a second crime scene.

- I'm guilty. What more
do you want from me ?
- The truth.

270
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,440
I have given you the truth.

271
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,360
There was someone else
in that attic with you. Who was it ?

272
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,800
- There was no one else.
- Then you're a liar.

273

00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,200
You wanna see the background check
I ran on him ?

276
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,800
He emigrated to Israel after
World War Il where he joined the lrgun--

277
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,200
the Jewish military
underground.

278
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,680
He was arrested in 1959
by the British for a bombing
that killed seven civilians.

279
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,320
He was a terrorist, Mulder.
A killer.

280
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,480
He's not our killer,
though.

281

a confession. I stood here and listened.

282

a second person in that attic, Scully.

And he's protecting whoever it is.

00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,760
about the contents
of this Sefer Yezirah.

297
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,320
- What is you want to know ?
- I want to know
about the myth of the golem.

298
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,360
I told you, Mr. Mulder.
This is a mystical text.

299
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,880
These pages are filled with
golems and dybbuks and demons
of every size and shape.

300
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,760
It's the golem
that I'm interested in.

301
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,720
I'm interested in why an F.B.I. agent
would be so interested in such a thing.

302
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,920
That's what I was hoping
you could tell me.

303
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,120
The early Kabbalists,

304
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,600
they believed that a
righteous man could actually...

305
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,200
create a living being
from the earth itself.

306
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,320
Fashioned from mud or clay.

307
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,200
But this creature could only be brought
to life by the power of the Word.

308
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,520
In-In-In practical terms,

309
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,560
by a direct application
of certain secret letter combinations.

310
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,840
Combinations found
in that book ?

311
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,640
Look, look. See ? See ?

312
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,480
These pages. They're
basically instructions...

313
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,520
for animating the inanimate.

314
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,440
You see, and this--

315
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,760
Yeah, and this passage here...

316
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,480
talks about inscribing
a single word on the golem itself.

317
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,200
- On the back of his hand ?
- I'm impressed.

318
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,280
- What is the magic word ?
- Emet.

319
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,000
See, these three letters,

320
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,240
"alef, men, tav, "
creates the word emet.

321
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,600
I don't speak Hebrew.
I don't know what that means.

322
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,960
Truth. Emet means "truth."

323
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,960
But you see,

324
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,960
Mr. Mulder,
therein lies the paradox.

325
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:05,240
Because the danger of the truth
is contained in the word "golem" itself,

326
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,760
which means "matter without
form, body without soul."

327
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,200
So the golem is
an imperfect creation.

328
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,240
A kind of monster, really.
Unable to speak or feel anything...

In the legends,
it runs amok...

331
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,680
and has to be destroyed
by its creator.

332
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,720
Destroyed how ?

333
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,520
By erasing the first letter,

334
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,160
"alef, " "emet" becomes "met, "

335
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,360
which means "dead."

336
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,560
Again, Mr. Mulder,
the power of letters.

337
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,560
Not just to create,
but to kill.

There's been another homicide.

340

- Curt Brunjes. I'm on my way
to the print shop right now.

Okay, I can be there
in ten minutes.

342
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,800
He was a man on a mission.
Look at all the energy he spent
spreading his hatred.

343
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,920
He certainly wasn’t
toiling in obscurity.

- Oh, my God.

It's Isaac Luria.
He's still alive.

I'm not so sure about that.

No, thank you.
That won't be necessary.

353

Well, the coroner matched
Luria's dental records.

354
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,200
It was definitely his corpse
that was in that grave.

355
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,400
You know, Mulder, this videotape,
it must have been altered somehow.

Planted by whoever
is staging this hoax.

357
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,520
- It's not a hoax, Scully. It never was.
- But if Luria is dead, Mulder--

358
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,040
This is not Luria.
Not really.

359
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,400
Well, who do you think it is ?
Do you think it's some kind of a ghost ?

360
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,520
No, a ghost is spirit
without form.

361
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,600
But I believe what we're looking
for and what we're seeing here
is form without spirit.

362
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,040
- Something called a golem.
- A golem ?

363
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,120
Yeah, it's-- it's a kind of a manmade
monster described in Jewish folklore.

364
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,720
It's fashioned from mud and then
animated through mystical incantation.

Mud ? Mulder,

366
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,120
And for what purpose ?
Exacting revenge ?

367
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,960
I don't think it was hate that created
this golem, Scully. I think it was love.

their hate took him from you,

with your love.

call me back, Tata.

Isaac said he had to go.

393

That a customer needed him,
and that he would call me back.

ring later,

not to pick it up.
