Only what I've read
in the Herald,

23
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:24,702
that four young men have gone missing

reported missing, was found dead...

That's just it, Agent Scully,

No, but I'll let Dr. Bruin
give you his thoughts on that.

This was taken less than an hour
after Sanders' body was found.

that Owen Sanders was black.

134
00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:35,270
It contains
a cerebropathic glycoside.

135
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:37,901
- Does that mean anything to you?
- [ Scully] If I'm correct,

136
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:41,344
it's a cortical depressant that works
on the higher centers of the brain.

137
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:44,144
- Is it lethal?
- In large quantities it might be.

138

Larger than anything contained
in a single seed.

139
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:50,853
Did the toxicology screen detect
any of it in Sanders' blood?

00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:54,086
No, the tox screen
was clean.

141
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,287
Could his body have
metabolized the substance?

142
00:11:56,362 --> 00:12:01,026
Only if the victim
hadn't expired immediately.

143
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,799
- Does that tell you anything?
- No, but...

144
00:12:05,872 --> 00:12:09,899
I found something that could explain
the depigmentation in the victim.

145
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:14,345
- His pituitary gland was necrotized.
- His pituitary gland?

146
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:17,747
The pituitary gland secretes all of
the regulatory hormones in the body...

147
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,286
and it controls the production
of melanin in the skin cells.

148
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:23,822
So, you found evidence
that this is a disease?

149
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,825
No, I have
identified the effect.

150

seemed disoriented and non-responsive,

290
