And then I moved around
to the front door,

377

to kick the door in.

to go back to prison.

495
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,610
- Put the gun down, Roche !
- ...eleven, twelve,

496
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,480
- You have one left.
- thirteen,

497
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:31,400
-How are you gonna find her without me ?
-fourteen,

498
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,820
- How sure are you it's not Samantha ?
- fifteen,

499
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:38,490
- Huh ?
-sixteen, seventeen,

500
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:42,960
- How do you know ?
- eighteen,

501
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,250
- nineteen--
- [Gunshot]

502
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:48,170
[ Screaming ]

503
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:51,670
-[Scully]it’s okay. I got you.
-[Skinner]Call an ambulance.

504
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,450
[Knock At Door]

505
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,720
I got back
some lab results.

506
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,350
The dye analysis determined that
the fabric of the last heart...

507
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:47,020
was manufactured
between 1 969 and 1 974,

508
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:51,980
but beyond that,
there's nothing more they can tell us.

509
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,990
Mulder, it's not Samantha.

510
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:59,660
And whoever that little girl really is,
we'll find her.

511
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,870
How ?

512
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:06,040
I don't know,
but I do know you.

513
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:14,210
Why don't you go on home
and get some sleep.
