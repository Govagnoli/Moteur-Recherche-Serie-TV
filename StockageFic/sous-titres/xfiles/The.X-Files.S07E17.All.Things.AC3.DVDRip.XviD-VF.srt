1
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:17,541
Time passes in moments...

2
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,778
moments which rushing past...

3
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,117
define the path of a life...

4
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,157
just as surely
as they lead towards its end.

5
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:29,887
How rarely do we stop
to examine that path...

6
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:33,126
to see the reasons
why all things happen.

7
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:37,158
To consider whether the path
we take in life is our own making,

8
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,729
or simply one into
which we drift with eyes closed.

9
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:45,171
But what if we could stop,
pause to take stock...

10
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,043
of each precious moment
before it passes?

11
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:52,710
Might we then see the endless forks
in the road that have shaped a life?

12
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,653
And seeing those choices,

13
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,350
choose another path?

14
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:10,984
I see the storm has broken...

15
00:02:11,062 --> 00:02:13,860
in the middle of the night.

16
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:16,900
Nothing left here for me.

17
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:18,902
It's washed away.

18
00:02:20,204 --> 00:02:23,640
The rain pushes the buildings aside.

19
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:27,508
- I got the lab to rush the results of...
- The sky turns...

20
00:02:27,578 --> 00:02:31,639
I said, I got the lab to rush
the results of the Szezesny
autopsy, if you're interested.

21
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:35,345
- I heard you, Scully.
- Szezesny did indeed drown.

22
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,653
But not as the result
of the inhalation of ectoplasm
as you so vehemently suggested.

23
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:43,159
What else could she have
possibly drowned in?

24
00:02:43,227 --> 00:02:45,559
Margarita mix.

25
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,157
Upchucked with about 40 ounces
of Corcovado Gold tequila, which...

26
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:52,225
as it turns out, she and her friends
rapidly consumed in the woods...

27
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:54,931
while trying to reenact
The Blair Witch Project.

28
00:02:55,006 --> 00:02:58,339
I think that demands a little deeper
investigation, don't you?

29
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:00,343
No, I don't.

30
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:04,142
Well, it doesn't matter,
'cause we got bigger fish to fry.

31
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:07,048
Have a seat, Scully.
Check this out.

32
00:03:07,118 --> 00:03:11,054
- Is that beautiful or what?
- Crop circles, Mulder?

33
00:03:11,122 --> 00:03:13,886
Computer-generated crop circles.

34
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,688
It's a fractal image predicted
by a computer program using data...

35
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:20,094
of every known occurrence
of the phenomena over the past 40 years.

36
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,258
What most people don't realize
is that since 1991...

37
00:03:26,337 --> 00:03:29,238
- There's been a dramatic increase...

38
00:03:29,307 --> 00:03:31,400
in size and complexity
of circle designs.

39
00:03:31,476 --> 00:03:33,603
That's when the Mandlebrot Set
appeared in England...

40
00:03:33,678 --> 00:03:38,479
a series of geometrically perfect rings
appearing almost impossibly overnight...

41
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:41,017
in a field near Cambridge.

42
00:03:44,288 --> 00:03:46,347
But that was merely prelude
of what was to come.

43
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:49,450
Three years later in 1994,

44
00:03:49,527 --> 00:03:53,554
even more complex formations
occurred simultaneously...

45
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:56,327
on opposite ends of the English
countryside with the Mandlebrot Set,

46
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,096
where it's still there
at its center.

47
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,732
Then in 1997, even more complex
formations occurred.

48
00:04:03,808 --> 00:04:06,971
And I'm not wearing
any pants right now.

49
00:04:10,248 --> 00:04:12,648
- Hmm?
- You're not listening.

50
00:04:12,717 --> 00:04:15,311
I am.

51
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,653
I guess I just don't
see the point.

52
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,387
The point is that a computer
program has shown us...

53
00:04:24,462 --> 00:04:28,262
that these are not just random
happenstance coincidental occurrences.

54
00:04:28,332 --> 00:04:31,961
And that same program has predicted
that in just 48 hours...

55
00:04:32,036 --> 00:04:35,699
even more complex formations are gonna
be laid down in a field near Avebury.

56
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:39,800
Forty-eight hours, Scully,
but I wouldn't mind getting
there earlier, if you don't mind.

57
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:43,313
- Getting where?
- England. I got two tickets
on a 5:30 flight.

58
00:04:43,381 --> 00:04:46,077
Mulder, I still have to go
over to the hospital and...

59
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,516
finish the final paperwork
on that autopsy you had me do.

60
00:04:48,586 --> 00:04:50,554
And to be honest,
it's Saturday.

61
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:54,352
And I wouldn't mind,
I don't know, taking a bath.

62
00:04:56,193 --> 00:04:59,128
- What the hell does that mean?
- What it means is that
I'm not interested...

63
00:04:59,196 --> 00:05:03,223
in tracking down some sneaky
farmers who happened to ace
geometry in high school.

64
00:05:04,902 --> 00:05:09,896
And besides, what could you
possibly get out of this?

65
00:05:09,974 --> 00:05:14,468
Or learn? I mean,
it's not even remotely FBI related.

66
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:20,841
I'll just cancel your ticket.

67
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:25,918
Thanks for lunch.

68
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,517
Mulder.
Look, we're always running.

69
00:05:30,828 --> 00:05:32,921
We're always chasing
the next big thing.

70
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:36,692
Why don't you ever
just stay still?

71
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:39,258
I wouldn't know
what I'd be missing.

72
00:05:50,314 --> 00:05:52,248
My name is Dana Scully...

73
00:05:52,316 --> 00:05:56,184
and I was told I could
pick up a postmortem folder
for a Miss Szezesny here.

74
00:05:56,253 --> 00:05:58,187
It's for the FBI.

75
00:05:58,255 --> 00:06:00,382
Let's see. Oh.

76
00:06:14,305 --> 00:06:16,569
And just sign here, please.

77
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:21,878
Thank you.

78
00:06:53,177 --> 00:06:55,805
Hi. Um, I was given
the wrong test results.

79
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,317
This X ray marked D. Waterston
was in the envelope marked Szezesny.

80
00:07:00,384 --> 00:07:02,477
I was expecting autopsy results.

81
00:07:02,553 --> 00:07:06,922
I'm sorry.
They must have gotten switched.

82
00:07:11,328 --> 00:07:13,262
Sorry for the inconvenience.

83
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,764
Thank you.

84
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:19,792
Is the, um... Is the D. Waterston
that was on the X ray,

85
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,997
is that a Dr. Daniel Waterston?

86
00:07:23,407 --> 00:07:25,898
Waterston, Waterston.
Yes, it is.

87
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:29,036
Admitted yesterday,
coronary care unit, room 306.

88
00:07:31,082 --> 00:07:33,016
Thank you.

89
00:07:38,322 --> 00:07:41,621
I'm sorry.
I don't know what else to say.

90
00:07:41,692 --> 00:07:44,160
Everything appears to be
as it should,

91
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:46,162
under the circumstances.

92
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,061
So, don't worry.

93
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:50,623
If you'd like, I could show you
the hospital cafeteria.

94
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:53,636
Uh, I guess...
Yeah, okay.

95
00:07:55,806 --> 00:07:58,468
Are there phones down there too?
I need to make some phone calls.

96
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:00,476
Yes.

97
00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:48,785
- Excuse me.
Can I help you with something?

98
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:52,625
Uh, I'm sorry. I'm Dr. Scully.
I was just in the hospital and...

99
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:55,256
Can we step into the hallway?

100
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:57,266
Yeah.

101
00:09:01,972 --> 00:09:06,238
I'm Dr. Waterston's cardiologist, Paul
Kopeikan. You say your name was Scully?

102
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,244
Uh, yes, Dana Scully.

103
00:09:08,312 --> 00:09:12,146
- Dr. Waterston's mentioned you.
- I'm sorry. You must be mistaken.

104
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:15,708
You were a student
of his, right?

105
00:09:15,786 --> 00:09:17,720
He has a heart condition?

106
00:09:17,788 --> 00:09:21,952
Dr. Waterston came in yesterday
with severe chest pains.

107
00:09:22,026 --> 00:09:25,154
And he ordered us to do
an echocardiogram...

108
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:27,754
and a biopsy because
he'd had symptoms...

109
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:30,232
of an upper respiratory
infection the week before.

110
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:32,670
Fortunately, it was the right call.

111
00:09:32,803 --> 00:09:35,431
- Then it's serious.
- But treatable.

112
00:09:35,506 --> 00:09:38,134
- I have to wake him up soon
if you'd care to...
- No.

113
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,006
That's all right.
But thanks for your time.

114
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:43,239
He must have been
a wonderful teacher.

115
00:09:43,313 --> 00:09:46,771
I've been following his work on
constrictive pericarditis for years now.

116
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,444
Yes.

117
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,579
He's a remarkable man.

118
00:10:10,774 --> 00:10:13,937
- Hello?
-  You came to see him.

119
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:16,138
I'm sorry.
Who is this?

120
00:10:16,213 --> 00:10:19,341
- Margaret Waterston.
- Maggie.

121
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,407
Is everything all right?

122
00:10:21,485 --> 00:10:24,454
- Well, that depends, doesn't it?
- I'm sorry?

123
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:29,652
Whatever. Dr. Kopeikan told my father you
were here, and now he wants to see you.

124
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:32,127
- About what?
- Look.

125
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:34,960
He asked me to call,
so I'm calling.

126
00:10:35,032 --> 00:10:38,763
I don't know, Maggie.
I-I... I don't know if I've got time.

127
00:10:38,836 --> 00:10:41,964
- Don't know if you have the time.

128
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:45,839
- Maggie, can you hang on a second?
I have another call.
- Listen.

129
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:49,970
It's your choice,
but if you come, it doesn't mean
I accept you being in his life.

130
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:56,419
Hello?

131
00:10:56,487 --> 00:10:59,388
I'll never see you again.

132
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:02,914
- Hello?
- Hey, you're there?

133
00:11:06,096 --> 00:11:09,497
- Hey.
- Mulder, aren't you supposed
to be on a plane?

134
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:11,659
I got a 5:30 flight, remember?

135
00:11:11,735 --> 00:11:13,794
Right.
I guess I lost track of time.

136
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:16,863
Listen, the reason I called...
Am I catching you at a bad time?

137
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,340
No, I just walked in.
Why?

138
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:23,345
There's this group in D.C.
that is researching crop circles,

139
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:27,076
and they've got a totally
different set of coordinates
from the one I got already.

140
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:29,619
- Mulder, I'm not going.
- I gotta ask you a favor.

141
00:11:29,686 --> 00:11:31,950
One of the researchers lives
out near the hospital...

142
00:11:32,022 --> 00:11:35,958
and they've got these sensitive photos
and data and stuff that
they won't fax to me.

143
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:39,291
So I was wondering if you would
go over there and, you know,

144
00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:41,797
and get it and put it in...

145
00:11:46,804 --> 00:11:49,068
Speak to me, Scully.

146
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:51,937
I'm out for the evening, Mulder.

147
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:56,139
- Well, why didn't you just
say so in the first place?
- Look.

148
00:11:56,213 --> 00:11:59,080
Why don't you leave that address
on my answering machine...

149
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:01,208
and, uh, I'll try it for you.

150
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:25,637
I'm sorry.
I... I have the wrong room.

151
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:28,007
That's okay.

152
00:13:18,428 --> 00:13:20,521
Hi.

153
00:13:20,597 --> 00:13:25,796
Do I have to lock eyes with the devil
for you to grace me with your presence?

154
00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:28,702
Surely not the devil.

155
00:13:32,643 --> 00:13:35,009
How are you feeling, Daniel?

156
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:38,809
It's a real drag when the body
doesn't wanna play anymore.

157
00:13:38,882 --> 00:13:42,113
You're extremely lucky
you called that diagnosis.

158
00:13:42,185 --> 00:13:44,210
Luck has nothing to do
with it, Dana.

159
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:47,257
That's what doctors do every day.
You may have forgotten that.

160
00:13:47,324 --> 00:13:48,985
Daniel.

161
00:13:53,964 --> 00:13:57,422
So, how did you happen
to be here in Washington?

162
00:13:58,502 --> 00:14:00,766
That's a long story.

163
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:26,319
- How's the FBI?
- Is that why you wanted to see me?

164
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:29,763
To remind me once again
what a bad choice I made?

165
00:14:34,037 --> 00:14:38,235
Believe me, my motivation
is far more selfish than that.

166
00:14:40,644 --> 00:14:42,737
You scare me, Daniel.

167
00:14:42,813 --> 00:14:44,747
I know.

168
00:14:46,883 --> 00:14:49,545
I scare you...

169
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:52,986
because I represent
that which is ingrained,

170
00:14:53,056 --> 00:14:56,548
not only in your mind,
but in your heart...

171
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:59,117
that which you secretly long for.

172
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:02,965
You never accepted
my reason for leaving.

173
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:05,797
It wasn't a reason.
It was an excuse.

174
00:15:06,903 --> 00:15:09,167
But you understood why.

175
00:15:10,374 --> 00:15:13,434
I can't believe
the FBI is a passion.

176
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,774
Not like medicine.

177
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:20,413
I'm sorry I came.

178
00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:29,121
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

179
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:34,793
I know how difficult
it must have been for you,

180
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:37,425
just walking through that door.

181
00:15:39,202 --> 00:15:41,762
But you wouldn't have come
if you didn't want to.

182
00:15:43,006 --> 00:15:45,600
That says something,
doesn't it?

183
00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:08,524
- Scully.
-  I was just about
to leave you a message.

184
00:16:08,598 --> 00:16:12,329
I got that address that
I wanted you to go to for me.

185
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:14,461
It's a woman you're
gonna be dealing with.

186
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:17,598
She's affiliated with
American Daoist Healing Center.

187
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:22,008
- She researches crop circles?
- Don't roll your eyes, Scully.

188
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,570
-  Mulder.

189
00:16:24,648 --> 00:16:27,208
You want me to...

190
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:52,604
Scully?

191
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:54,940
Scully, are you there?

192
00:17:28,242 --> 00:17:31,439
Hi. I'm... You were...

193
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:33,480
- At the hospital today.
- Right.

194
00:17:33,547 --> 00:17:35,674
That's strange.

195
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,981
I'm Agent Scully.
I'm here on behalf of my partner.

196
00:17:39,053 --> 00:17:43,490
- About my research.
- For the FBI, as odd as that may sound.

197
00:17:43,557 --> 00:17:47,357
- I'm Colleen Azar.
Would you like to come in?
- No, thank you. I'm...

198
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:50,124
- I think I need some fresh air.
- Are you all right?

199
00:17:50,197 --> 00:17:55,294
Yes, I... I mean, yes, I...
I'm just a little shaken.

200
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:58,668
A near car accident, I think.
It's nothing, really.

201
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:01,333
A car accident isn't nothing.

202
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:04,207
- I'm sorry?
- In my experience,

203
00:18:04,278 --> 00:18:07,304
they're often the end results of us
not paying attention to something.

204
00:18:08,883 --> 00:18:11,909
Look, I don't mean to be rude,
but I really don't have much time.

205
00:18:11,986 --> 00:18:14,853
Sure.
I'll go get my papers.

206
00:18:22,563 --> 00:18:25,259
You think what we do
is a little ridiculous, don't you?

207
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:29,166
Uh, to be honest, I don't exactly know
what it is that you do.

208
00:18:29,236 --> 00:18:31,397
But you've already
formed a judgment about it.

209
00:18:31,472 --> 00:18:34,168
I really should be going.

210
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:37,438
There is a greater intelligence
in all things.

211
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:40,241
Accidents,
or near accidents,

212
00:18:40,314 --> 00:18:43,715
often remind us that we need
to keep our mind open...

213
00:18:43,784 --> 00:18:45,877
to the lessons it gives.

214
00:18:45,953 --> 00:18:48,615
You may wanna slow down.

215
00:19:22,256 --> 00:19:24,486
Hello?

216
00:19:26,894 --> 00:19:30,295
Ah, Hurricane Scully has arrived.

217
00:19:30,364 --> 00:19:35,324
- I was summoned.
- Would you please tell the doc
why he should listen to me.

218
00:19:35,402 --> 00:19:40,567
We've already agreed to doses
of digoxin that are far beyond
what I normally recommend.

219
00:19:40,641 --> 00:19:42,836
I guarantee you, Doctor,
you're doing it right.

220
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,107
But I can't be responsible for treatment
that might exacerbate your illness.

221
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,513
There hasn't even been a double-blind
analysis of prednisone's effect.

222
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,847
Prednisone?

223
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,253
That won't complicate
cardiac arrhythmia,
not if it's just a short burst.

224
00:19:56,323 --> 00:19:59,918
There.
An informed opinion.

225
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:11,767
You come off so rational,
but maybe you know less than you think.

226
00:20:18,712 --> 00:20:22,375
She's, uh, been through
some difficult times.

227
00:20:23,884 --> 00:20:26,478
And she's very angry.

228
00:20:26,554 --> 00:20:28,886
How did she even find out?

229
00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:30,890
There are things you don't know...

230
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,950
things I'm not proud of.

231
00:20:35,262 --> 00:20:37,263
What things?

232
00:20:37,396 --> 00:20:39,694
I screwed up, Dana.

233
00:20:39,765 --> 00:20:42,029
Things got bad at home after...

234
00:20:51,377 --> 00:20:55,677
- Bad how?
- I haven't been
completely honest with you.

235
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:59,483
It was hard for me...

236
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:03,884
when you walked away.

237
00:21:06,692 --> 00:21:09,058
I shut down from my family.

238
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:14,165
Needless to say,
it was very difficult for Barbara.

239
00:21:15,467 --> 00:21:17,697
You divorced.

240
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:22,002
Only after an interminable
period of discomfort for us both.

241
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:24,770
Where did you go?

242
00:21:26,478 --> 00:21:29,709
Here. Washington.

243
00:21:30,783 --> 00:21:32,512
When?

244
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:34,882
Almost ten years ago.

245
00:21:35,954 --> 00:21:37,888
Daniel,

246
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:42,027
you didn't move here for me?

247
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:44,221
I didn't mean for it to happen this way,
of course.

248
00:21:44,296 --> 00:21:46,355
Oh, God.

249
00:21:56,175 --> 00:21:58,439
You've come at such a strange time.

250
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,274
I know. I know.
You... You have a life.

251
00:22:01,347 --> 00:22:03,611
I don't know what I have.

252
00:22:11,657 --> 00:22:13,591
Your X rays were in
the wrong envelope.

253
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:17,823
I never would have even known you
were here if it wasn't for a mix-up.

254
00:22:17,896 --> 00:22:20,330
It's just...

255
00:22:25,904 --> 00:22:28,395
What do you want, Dana?

256
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:34,939
I want everything I should want
at this time of my life.

257
00:22:40,352 --> 00:22:43,321
Maybe I want a life
I didn't choose.

258
00:24:03,469 --> 00:24:05,494
Nurse!

259
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:08,506
We have a code in here!

260
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:11,065
Nurse!

261
00:24:15,046 --> 00:24:19,415
Code blue, CCU. Code blue, CCU.

262
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:23,647
He's in V-fib.
Get his head.

263
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:35,365
- In!
- In.

264
00:24:38,003 --> 00:24:39,937
- Two hundred joules!
- Two hundred.

265
00:24:40,005 --> 00:24:42,439
- All clear?
- Clear.

266
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:45,843
- No pulse, no resps.
- Three hundred joules.

267
00:24:45,911 --> 00:24:47,845
- Three hundred charge.
- Clear!

268
00:24:47,913 --> 00:24:49,676
Clear.

269
00:24:49,748 --> 00:24:53,775
- No pulse, no resps.
- Epinephrine, one milligram,
IV push! Now!

270
00:24:53,852 --> 00:24:56,184
- Who's paying attention?
- Ready.

271
00:24:56,254 --> 00:24:58,654
- Clear!
- Clear.

272
00:25:00,091 --> 00:25:02,286
We have a pulse.

273
00:25:11,336 --> 00:25:13,702
Okay.

274
00:25:13,772 --> 00:25:15,740
Thank you.

275
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,468
Thank you.

276
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,884
Hi. Can I help you?

277
00:25:26,952 --> 00:25:29,250
Uh, I'm looking for Colleen.

278
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:32,313
- You wanna come in?
- I just need to speak
with her, that's all.

279
00:26:12,163 --> 00:26:15,530
- I have to go.
- Call me if anything
interesting happens.

280
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,068
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

281
00:26:22,874 --> 00:26:27,777
- I'm surprised to see you again.
- I'm sorry I was rude before.

282
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:30,144
I'm a medical doctor
and a scientist.

283
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:33,616
And you're right,
I don't know what it is that you do.

284
00:26:33,685 --> 00:26:36,586
But there was something that you said
that I wanted to ask you about.

285
00:26:36,655 --> 00:26:38,714
About slowing down.

286
00:26:40,358 --> 00:26:43,054
Would you like to sit down?

287
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:49,433
Please.

288
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:57,230
I have a friend who's ill.

289
00:26:57,308 --> 00:27:02,336
And, uh, I had
a strange feeling today,

290
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:04,473
just a short while ago, actually,

291
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:09,953
that he may be dying from a more
serious condition than anyone realizes.

292
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:12,751
You sense something.

293
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:18,688
Holistic practitioners believe,
as do many Eastern religions,

294
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:23,359
that living beings exist beyond the
physical dimensions of time and space.

295
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:27,132
That we're composed of layers
of energy and consciousness.

296
00:27:27,205 --> 00:27:30,538
You've probably heard it
referred to as an aura.

297
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:34,339
- Mmm, yes.
- Witness this energy field...

298
00:27:34,412 --> 00:27:37,313
and truths come out that have
little to do with scientific proof...

299
00:27:37,382 --> 00:27:39,976
and much to do with faith.

300
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,513
What are you saying
that I saw?

301
00:27:44,589 --> 00:27:47,285
Pain.

302
00:27:47,358 --> 00:27:50,225
And where there's pain,
there's a need for healing...

303
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:52,991
physically, mentally
or spiritually.

304
00:27:53,064 --> 00:27:55,532
But he has a heart condition.

305
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,594
When we hold onto shame
and guilt and fear,

306
00:28:00,672 --> 00:28:02,799
it creates imbalance.

307
00:28:02,874 --> 00:28:06,139
It makes us forget who we are.

308
00:28:11,082 --> 00:28:13,744
This is difficult
for you to accept.

309
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:21,823
Would you like
to have some tea?

310
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:30,131
Have you ever had moments
when everything gets incredibly clear?

311
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:34,236
When time seems to expand?

312
00:28:35,473 --> 00:28:37,771
Yes.

313
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:39,969
That's so strange.

314
00:28:40,044 --> 00:28:43,309
You may be more open
to things than you think.

315
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:49,684
It's just a matter
of what you do with it.

316
00:28:57,162 --> 00:28:59,221
I used to be a physicist.

317
00:28:59,297 --> 00:29:03,393
I was successful in my field
working 80 odd hours a week.

318
00:29:03,468 --> 00:29:07,837
I thought I was happy. Truth is
I was cut off from the world...

319
00:29:07,906 --> 00:29:09,840
and from myself.

320
00:29:09,908 --> 00:29:12,069
I was literally dying inside.

321
00:29:12,143 --> 00:29:15,840
I was in a relationship
with Carol, who you met,

322
00:29:15,914 --> 00:29:18,747
but I was so afraid of what
the world and my family...

323
00:29:18,817 --> 00:29:22,412
and my fellow scientists
would think that I told no one.

324
00:29:22,487 --> 00:29:25,547
Then two years ago,
I was diagnosed with breast cancer.

325
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:30,687
- I'm sorry.
-  Don't be.

326
00:29:30,762 --> 00:29:32,992
It's the cancer
that got my attention.

327
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:36,261
It stopped me from being
on the self-destructive path I was on.

328
00:29:36,334 --> 00:29:39,030
It made me realize I was in a field
that had little meaning for me...

329
00:29:39,103 --> 00:29:44,074
and it's what's allowed me
to be happy for what feels like
the first time in my life.

330
00:29:44,207 --> 00:29:47,836
Huh. But how?

331
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:52,507
I was introduced to a healer who helped
me see the disease for what it was.

332
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:57,019
It wasn't until I began releasing shame
and telling the truth...

333
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,681
that my cancer
went into remission.

334
00:30:02,492 --> 00:30:06,053
You still aren't sure.

335
00:30:06,129 --> 00:30:10,532
You came here looking
for answers and you want
something to take back with you.

336
00:30:17,073 --> 00:30:19,598
Everything happens for a reason.

337
00:30:28,318 --> 00:30:30,252
- Are you happy?
- I'm sorry.

338
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,788
I... I was just going up
to see your father.

339
00:30:32,856 --> 00:30:35,723
- You can't. He's in a coma.
- Since when?

340
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,488
Since about two minutes
after you supposedly saved his life.

341
00:30:42,232 --> 00:30:45,759
Do you have any idea the hell
you've created in our lives?

342
00:30:45,835 --> 00:30:49,430
Maggie, to be honest, I left
so there wouldn't be hell in your lives.

343
00:30:49,506 --> 00:30:53,408
Don't try to be reasonable with me.
I am so sick of being reasonable.

344
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:57,435
You moved on, but we've had
to live with what you left behind.

345
00:34:49,678 --> 00:34:52,943
What I try to do is clear
the body's energy channels,

346
00:34:53,014 --> 00:34:54,948
what we call chakras,

347
00:34:55,016 --> 00:34:59,476
which can become barriers to a doctor's
ability to effectively heal the patient.

348
00:34:59,554 --> 00:35:01,613
When these channels
are working improperly,

349
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,284
whether from poor physical
or emotional health,

350
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:06,850
the block serves to create
conditions for disease.

351
00:35:06,928 --> 00:35:09,556
If I can unblock
the energy early on,

352
00:35:09,631 --> 00:35:13,158
then I can prevent the onset
or escalation of an illness...

353
00:35:13,235 --> 00:35:16,170
What's going on here?

354
00:35:16,238 --> 00:35:18,968
Dr. Scully, who do you
think you are?

355
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,170
We have nothing but
Dr. Waterston's welfare in mind here.

356
00:35:23,245 --> 00:35:25,805
- You're not his doctor.
- I understand that.

357
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:28,543
What's taking place here
is an alternative approach.

358
00:35:30,385 --> 00:35:34,219
What's taking place here
is a waste of time, Dr. Scully.

359
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:36,723
And I think Dr. Waterston would be
the first to agree with me.

360
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:39,123
Have you considered that?

361
00:35:39,194 --> 00:35:43,563
I just wanted to help him.
It seemed like nothing else was working.

362
00:35:43,632 --> 00:35:46,795
All due respect,
that is not for you to assess.

363
00:35:46,868 --> 00:35:49,928
That is for me
or Dr. Waterston's family to decide.

364
00:35:50,005 --> 00:35:53,168
Then let 'em continue.

365
00:35:56,344 --> 00:36:00,041
If it isn't hurting him,
we should at least be open to it.

366
00:36:03,218 --> 00:36:07,484
I'm afraid there's really
nothing more I can do at this time.

367
00:36:07,555 --> 00:36:11,389
This man, quite frankly,
is ready to move on.

368
00:36:11,459 --> 00:36:14,087
But something seems
to be holding him back.

369
00:36:14,162 --> 00:36:16,858
Unfinished business is binding him
to the physical plane.

370
00:36:16,932 --> 00:36:18,866
Something he needs to release...

371
00:36:18,934 --> 00:36:21,562
before he can let go.

372
00:36:27,275 --> 00:36:29,110
Broken up. Pushing us.

373
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,702
Broken up. Pushing us.

374
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,347
Hear the rain fall.

375
00:36:35,417 --> 00:36:38,113
See the wind come to my eyes.

376
00:36:39,187 --> 00:36:41,587
See the storm broken.

377
00:36:41,656 --> 00:36:44,591
Now nothing.

378
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:49,858
Speak to me, baby,
in the middle of the night.

379
00:36:49,931 --> 00:36:51,865
Speak to me.

380
00:37:04,312 --> 00:37:06,405
- Hello.
-  It's Maggie.

381
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:09,279
- I need you to come
to the hospital right away.
- Maggie, what's...

382
00:37:22,197 --> 00:37:24,131
Daniel.

383
00:37:28,036 --> 00:37:30,800
You think I'd give up
so easily?

384
00:37:41,149 --> 00:37:43,743
You were slipping away.

385
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,916
No one thought
you'd come out of this.

386
00:37:52,394 --> 00:37:54,726
- I'm still in shock.
- Imagine my shock...

387
00:37:54,796 --> 00:37:58,664
when the doctor told me the voodoo
ritual you'd arranged for last night.

388
00:37:58,733 --> 00:38:02,294
- I was afraid it didn't work.
- Of course it didn't work.

389
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,861
Don't be absurd.
Where'd you get this crap?

390
00:38:04,939 --> 00:38:08,568
Daniel, that crap
may have just saved your life,

391
00:38:08,643 --> 00:38:10,770
whether you're open to it or not.

392
00:38:10,845 --> 00:38:13,313
It doesn't matter.
I don't wanna talk about that.

393
00:38:14,949 --> 00:38:16,883
Look at me.

394
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:20,585
I'm gonna get well.

395
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:27,120
And we need to talk about
what happens next for us.

396
00:38:29,497 --> 00:38:31,556
I spoke at length to Maggie.

397
00:38:33,868 --> 00:38:36,359
It's time...

398
00:38:36,438 --> 00:38:41,637
that you took responsibility
for the hurt you caused in your family.

399
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:44,542
It's no accident
that you got sick, Daniel.

400
00:38:44,612 --> 00:38:48,241
You've been running
from the truth for ten years.

401
00:38:48,316 --> 00:38:52,685
Dana, it was only
to be with you.

402
00:38:53,755 --> 00:38:56,315
You were all I lived for.

403
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:01,853
Maybe the reason you're alive now
is to make up for that...

404
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:06,233
to make it up to Maggie.

405
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:12,934
- That's Maggie talking, not you.
- No.

406
00:39:13,007 --> 00:39:15,874
I'm not the same person, Daniel.

407
00:39:19,547 --> 00:39:22,849
I wouldn't have known that
if I hadn't seen you again.

408
00:40:38,724 --> 00:40:40,749
Excuse me!

409
00:40:45,097 --> 00:40:46,758
Hey.

410
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:50,165
- Mulder?
- I was just looking for you.

411
00:40:50,236 --> 00:40:52,295
But you're supposed to be
in England.

412
00:40:54,206 --> 00:40:56,640
- I'm back.
- What happened?

413
00:40:56,709 --> 00:41:00,008
Nothing. There was no event,
no crop circles.

414
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,242
- Big waste of time.

415
00:41:04,717 --> 00:41:07,345
Maybe sometimes nothing happens
for a reason, Mulder.

416
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,786
What is that supposed to mean?

417
00:41:09,855 --> 00:41:12,187
Nothing.

418
00:41:12,258 --> 00:41:14,658
Come on.
I'll make you some tea.

419
00:41:16,762 --> 00:41:20,095
I just find it hard to believe.

420
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:24,967
- What part?
- The part where I go away for
two days, your whole life changes.

421
00:41:25,037 --> 00:41:27,130
I didn't say
my whole life changed.

422
00:41:27,206 --> 00:41:31,233
You speaking to God in
a Buddhist temple. God speaking back?

423
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,505
Now, I didn't say
that God spoke back.

424
00:41:33,579 --> 00:41:36,844
I said that I had
some kind of a vision.

425
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:40,647
Well, for you that's like saying
you're having David Crosby's baby.

426
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:48,325
What is it?

427
00:41:48,394 --> 00:41:51,090
I once considered spending
my whole life with this man.

428
00:41:54,033 --> 00:41:56,297
What I would have missed.

429
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,361
I don't think you can know.

430
00:41:59,438 --> 00:42:03,204
I mean, how many different lives
would we be leading if we
made different choices?

431
00:42:03,275 --> 00:42:05,607
We... We don't know.

432
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,974
What if there was
only one choice...

433
00:42:12,952 --> 00:42:15,147
and all the other ones
were wrong...

434
00:42:16,956 --> 00:42:20,119
and there were signs along the way
to pay attention to?

435
00:42:21,727 --> 00:42:24,423
Then all the... choices...

436
00:42:24,497 --> 00:42:27,762
would then lead
to this very moment.

437
00:42:29,001 --> 00:42:31,936
One wrong turn and...

438
00:42:32,004 --> 00:42:34,131
we wouldn't be sitting
here together.

439
00:42:34,206 --> 00:42:36,470
Now, that says a lot.

440
00:42:37,476 --> 00:42:39,410
It says a lot, a lot, a lot.

441
00:42:39,478 --> 00:42:43,574
I mean, it's probably more
than we should be getting
into at this late hour.
