1
00:00:26,843 --> 00:00:32,201
We don't have to be out here, you know.
It's not like you're still in high school.

2
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:34,319
We can go to the motel.

3
00:00:34,403 --> 00:00:38,282
- I wouldn't want anyone to see us.
- No one will see us.

4
00:00:38,363 --> 00:00:40,354
It's a small town.

5
00:00:48,243 --> 00:00:50,234
<i>(grunts in pain)</i>

6
00:01:00,123 --> 00:01:03,274
George... Come on, George.

7
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:32,281
- Why'd you change your mind anyway?
- You're pretty persistent, I guess.

8
00:01:32,363 --> 00:01:34,831
- Squeaky wheel gets the oil?
- I guess so.

9
00:01:34,923 --> 00:01:38,359
What's wrong with right here?
I could set the blanket down and...

10
00:01:38,443 --> 00:01:40,638
- Not yet.
- Why not?

11
00:01:41,363 --> 00:01:44,400
Because... you have to catch me first.

12
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:52,271
Oh, come on now! You don't
want me to chase after you, do ya?

13
00:01:55,803 --> 00:01:57,794
Paula!

14
00:02:03,963 --> 00:02:05,760
Paula?

15
00:02:11,403 --> 00:02:13,155
Paula...

16
00:02:13,243 --> 00:02:15,234
Where are you?

17
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:24,354
Son of a bitch!

18
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:42,554
<i>(screams)</i>

19
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:40,032
I don't know, Scully. The man hasn't
been seen or heard from in ten weeks.

20
00:03:40,123 --> 00:03:42,876
Come on, Mulder. They're wasting our time.

21
00:03:42,963 --> 00:03:46,433
They're sending us
on some kind of a wild-goose chase.

22
00:03:46,523 --> 00:03:48,753
Chicken chase.

23
00:03:49,043 --> 00:03:52,831
George Kearns was a poultry inspector
assigned to Dudley, Arkansas...

24
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:55,073
...home of Chaco Chicken.

25
00:03:55,163 --> 00:03:59,475
I'm not questioning the legitimacy of
the case, just their motives in assigning it.

26
00:03:59,563 --> 00:04:02,202
Doesn't it bother you
that they're undermining you?

27
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,400
They may think they are,
but on the night he disappeared...

28
00:04:05,483 --> 00:04:08,998
...a woman on the l-10
saw a strange fire in an adjacent field.

29
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:13,395
I read that report. She claims
that she saw some kind of a foxfire spirit.

30
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:16,316
I'm surprised she didn't
call Oprah after the police.

31
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:22,080
19th-century tales from the Ozarks describe
people being taken away by fireballs.

32
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:25,712
- The spirits of massacred Indians.
- Those are only legends.

33
00:04:25,803 --> 00:04:29,079
Well, most legends
don't leave behind 12-foot burn marks.

34
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:32,997
That was taken by state police
in the field where the woman saw foxfire.

35
00:04:33,443 --> 00:04:38,961
- This could have been made by a bonfire.
- I thought so, too. Until I remembered this.

36
00:04:39,043 --> 00:04:42,513
A documentary I saw when I was
in college about an insane asylum.

37
00:04:42,603 --> 00:04:45,913
- It gave me nightmares.
- I thought nothing gave you nightmares.

38
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:47,994
I was young.

39
00:04:49,403 --> 00:04:52,201
<i>They, uh... See, they took...</i>

40
00:04:52,283 --> 00:04:55,673
<i>They, uh... They took me away.</i>

41
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:58,072
<i>They took me away... This... The fire demons.</i>

42
00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:02,873
<i>The fire demons...</i>
<i>wanted their pound of flesh.</i>

43
00:05:02,963 --> 00:05:04,874
<i>But, uh...</i>

44
00:05:04,963 --> 00:05:07,875
<i>... l'm too fast for 'em. (chuckles nervously)</i>

45
00:05:09,763 --> 00:05:13,073
<i>You cannot kill them.</i>
<i>You can't let them kill you. Oh, no...</i>

46
00:05:13,163 --> 00:05:16,997
<i>No, don't let them kill you.</i>
<i>That's no way to get to heaven.</i>

47
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,074
<i>No, sir...</i>

48
00:05:20,243 --> 00:05:22,677
<i>No, sir. That is no way to get to heaven.</i>

49
00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:28,121
His name was Creighton Jones. He pulled off
the road on May 17th 1961 to take a nap.

50
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:32,879
They found him three days later so deranged
by what he'd seen that he was committed.

51
00:05:32,963 --> 00:05:37,593
The state police found his car on the l-10,
right in the middle of Dudley, Arkansas...

52
00:05:37,683 --> 00:05:39,674
...home of Chaco Chicken.

53
00:05:55,363 --> 00:05:57,558
What's this, Mulder?

54
00:05:59,203 --> 00:06:04,357
That's a witches' peg. Staking it into the
ground is supposed to ward off evil spirits.

55
00:06:04,443 --> 00:06:06,434
Can I help you folks?

56
00:06:07,163 --> 00:06:10,678
I'm Sheriff Arens.
I saw you back at the turn-off.

57
00:06:10,763 --> 00:06:13,755
FBI. I'm Special Agent Mulder.
This is Agent Scully.

58
00:06:13,843 --> 00:06:16,801
We're investigating
George Kearns's disappearance.

59
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:21,354
I'm happy to help you, but I'm not sure
how much there is to investigate.

60
00:06:21,443 --> 00:06:25,800
- Sheriff, a man is missing.
- We found no evidence of criminal activity.

61
00:06:25,883 --> 00:06:29,762
Since no body turned up,
we just filed a missing person's report.

62
00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:32,960
Why didn't you mention
this witches' peg in your report?

63
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:35,716
Because these hills
are filled with witches' pegs.

64
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:39,034
These old hill people
cling tight to their superstitions.

65
00:06:39,123 --> 00:06:42,638
- What about the scorched area?
- Illegal trash burn.

66
00:06:42,723 --> 00:06:45,874
I keep handing out the citations.
They keep doing it anyway.

67
00:06:45,963 --> 00:06:48,193
Cheaper to pay a fine
than haul it to the dump.

68
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,002
- So you don't believe it's foxfire?
- Sir...

69
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:54,917
...foxfire's nothing more than
a ghost story about swamp gas.

70
00:06:55,003 --> 00:07:00,031
Listen, Kearns was passin' through town
ever since he got here six months ago.

71
00:07:00,123 --> 00:07:02,318
- How do you mean?
- Never did fit in.

72
00:07:02,643 --> 00:07:05,032
Not at the plant, not even in his own home.

73
00:07:05,123 --> 00:07:09,992
- He cheated on his wife every chance he got.
- Did he have many chances?

74
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:15,760
George is the type of man you'd expect to go
chasin' some sweet young thing out of town.

75
00:07:15,843 --> 00:07:20,473
- Is that what his wife thinks happened?
- Push comes to shove, I'm sure she does.

76
00:07:20,563 --> 00:07:22,872
But you're welcome to ask her yourself.

77
00:07:27,483 --> 00:07:31,271
My husband had a character
that leaves something out.

78
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:33,274
I always knew that about him...

79
00:07:33,363 --> 00:07:38,517
...but I didn't have the sense to do anything
about it. I guess he saved me the trouble.

80
00:07:38,603 --> 00:07:42,562
So you're fairly certain
that he left you for somebody else?

81
00:07:42,643 --> 00:07:47,319
George left me a long time ago,
right around the time I turned 40.

82
00:07:47,803 --> 00:07:50,112
Leavin' town was just a formality.

83
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:55,231
- Do you know who he might be with now?
- No. And I don't wanna know, either.

84
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:59,601
He was about to file this inspection report
with the Department of Agriculture...

85
00:07:59,683 --> 00:08:02,834
...the day before he disappeared.
- I know nothing about that.

86
00:08:03,163 --> 00:08:08,032
- He never discussed his work with you?
- He never told me and I never asked.

87
00:08:08,123 --> 00:08:12,799
He cited several health violations. He was
gonna recommend the plant be shut down.

88
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:15,602
I don't know a thing about
what went on in that plant.

89
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:19,915
Did he ever receive threatening phone calls
or anything unusual in the mail?

90
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:24,155
There were hang-ups, but I always
thought it was one of his girlfriends.

91
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,199
I'm gonna give you my phone number.

92
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:32,162
If your husband tries to contact you,
I want you to get in touch with me.

93
00:08:32,243 --> 00:08:34,962
Or if you can think of anything else.

94
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:16,519
<i>(woman)</i> Come on, Paula. Let's go!

95
00:09:58,003 --> 00:10:02,440
This is Jess Harold, the floor manager.
Jess, these people are with the FBI.

96
00:10:02,523 --> 00:10:04,718
You're here about George Kearns?

97
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:08,716
His disappearance may have
something to do with a report...

98
00:10:08,803 --> 00:10:12,000
...he was about to file
with the Department of Agriculture.

99
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:15,359
Ever since he got here,
George was trying to shut us down.

100
00:10:16,003 --> 00:10:20,793
- He cited multiple violations.
- I know. I had to answer to each one of them.

101
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:23,962
Was there any merit to his claims?

102
00:10:24,043 --> 00:10:26,398
Let me show you something.

103
00:10:35,683 --> 00:10:37,674
<i>(gasping)</i>

104
00:10:41,403 --> 00:10:43,678
Paula, are you OK?

105
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:15,277
This is where George worked. Every chicken
passes through the inspectors' station.

106
00:11:15,363 --> 00:11:19,720
We've been here 50 years and had no trouble
with the USDA until George came along.

107
00:11:19,803 --> 00:11:23,000
- So he really did threaten to shut it down.
- Oh, he tried.

108
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:27,759
But we got three other inspectors here
consistently give us top marks. Here.

109
00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:30,474
See for yourself.

110
00:11:30,563 --> 00:11:32,872
The only problem this plant had was George.

111
00:11:32,963 --> 00:11:35,921
Problem enough to do something about?

112
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:39,518
If you mean any kind of unsavouriness,
I guess anything's possible.

113
00:11:39,603 --> 00:11:43,232
George had a bone to pick with everyone,
even the federal government.

114
00:11:43,323 --> 00:11:46,156
- What do you mean?
- He filed a compensation suit.

115
00:11:46,243 --> 00:11:50,714
Claimed he was getting terrible headaches.
"Line hypnosis" his lawyers called it.

116
00:11:50,963 --> 00:11:54,194
Yeah, it's caused by
high-speed repetitive activity.

117
00:11:54,283 --> 00:11:59,357
I don't deny a lot of chickens go through here
but we operate within federal guidelines.

118
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:01,434
What happened to his lawsuit?

119
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:05,721
It was dismissed, just a few weeks
before he disappeared.

120
00:12:05,803 --> 00:12:07,794
What's that?

121
00:12:08,643 --> 00:12:10,440
Oh, that.

122
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:12,957
Feed grinder. Chops up bone, tissue.

123
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:17,241
See, any part of the bird we can't package,
we process and use as feed.

124
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:20,793
- Chickens feed on chickens?
- It doesn't sound appetising.

125
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:23,113
But it <i>is</i> nutritious and cuts down on cost.

126
00:12:23,203 --> 00:12:27,913
The meat is cooked, then mixed with grain.
No reason to let all that protein go to waste.

127
00:12:28,003 --> 00:12:30,961
- Excuse me. I got a shift change.
- Howdy, Sheriff.

128
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:32,840
Logan.

129
00:12:33,363 --> 00:12:36,241
Mulder, ready to admit
they sent us on a fool's errand?

130
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:39,520
If the fool would persist in his folly,
he'd become wise.

131
00:12:39,603 --> 00:12:44,996
Whether Kearns left or was killed, this could
have been handled by any Kansas City agent.

132
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,551
- I'm not so sure about that.
- <i>(woman screams)</i>

133
00:12:49,563 --> 00:12:51,679
Let him go! We're federal agents.

134
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:55,154
<i>(Scully)</i> Everyone stay calm!

135
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:58,193
Don't hurt him! Tell us what you want.

136
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:01,281
Don't get excited. Just calm down.

137
00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:05,075
Stay calm! You don't want anyone to get hurt.

138
00:13:05,723 --> 00:13:08,954
We can talk this thing out.
Why don't you give me the knife?

139
00:13:11,683 --> 00:13:13,435
<i>(gunshot)</i>

140
00:13:18,283 --> 00:13:20,319
You OK?

141
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,472
Do you have any idea why she attacked you?

142
00:13:39,563 --> 00:13:42,919
- None at all.
- No recent complaints or strange behaviour?

143
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:47,282
Paula has always been one of
our best employees. Stable, well-liked.

144
00:13:47,363 --> 00:13:49,923
I can't begin to imagine what brought this on.

145
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:52,642
Dr Randolph, do you have any ideas?

146
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:55,032
If you're done with me, I got work to do.

147
00:13:55,403 --> 00:13:58,918
Come by tomorrow and let me
make sure it's not infected.

148
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:00,800
Sure.

149
00:14:03,163 --> 00:14:04,562
Uh...

150
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:08,033
Paula came by last week,
complaining of persistent headaches.

151
00:14:08,123 --> 00:14:11,672
She had suddenly started
getting irritable, unable to sleep.

152
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:15,479
- Did you determine the cause?
- I'm just the staff physician.

153
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,838
I usually only treat hand injuries...

154
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:21,393
...so I'm a little out of my depth
on psychiatric matters.

155
00:14:21,483 --> 00:14:24,043
Was anything physically wrong with her?

156
00:14:24,123 --> 00:14:26,876
I sent her to County
for a brain scan and an EEG.

157
00:14:26,963 --> 00:14:30,797
Both came back normal, so I assumed
her condition was stress-related.

158
00:14:30,883 --> 00:14:35,161
- Could it have been line hypnosis?
- I'm not qualified to make that diagnosis.

159
00:14:35,243 --> 00:14:38,872
But you can tell us whether
George Kearns had similar complaints.

160
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:42,952
They presented similar symptoms, yeah.

161
00:14:43,403 --> 00:14:48,796
- <i>(Scully)</i> How did you treat them?
- Both with pain medication - codeine.

162
00:14:48,883 --> 00:14:52,159
I think an autopsy on Paula Gray
would clarify things.

163
00:14:52,243 --> 00:14:55,315
I'm, uh... afraid I can't authorise that.

164
00:14:55,403 --> 00:14:58,440
- That's up to Mr Chaco.
- Why? You're her physician.

165
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:04,155
Yeah, but Mr Chaco was Paula Gray's
grandfather... and her legal guardian.

166
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,912
<i>(Mulder)</i> Mr Chaco?

167
00:15:59,003 --> 00:16:01,153
Feedin' these chickens...

168
00:16:01,723 --> 00:16:04,317
...helps me clear my mind.

169
00:16:05,723 --> 00:16:08,237
They're perfect creatures, you know.

170
00:16:08,323 --> 00:16:13,113
We eat their meat, their eggs,
sleep on pillows stuffed with their feathers.

171
00:16:15,003 --> 00:16:18,552
Not many people I know
are as useful as these chickens.

172
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:22,113
Sorry to disturb you, sir.
We realise this is difficult for you.

173
00:16:22,203 --> 00:16:25,832
You wanna conduct
an autopsy on my granddaughter.

174
00:16:26,883 --> 00:16:28,475
Why?

175
00:16:31,483 --> 00:16:34,953
You think Paula had some disease
that made her act that way?

176
00:16:38,883 --> 00:16:41,761
I thought your business
was Kearns's disappearance.

177
00:16:41,843 --> 00:16:45,392
It is, but it may be linked with
what happened to your granddaughter.

178
00:16:41,843 --> 00:16:45,392
It is, but it may be linked with
what happened to your granddaughter.

179
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:47,157
How?

180
00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:52,476
It's possible they may have both suffered
from the same neurological disorder.

181
00:16:52,563 --> 00:16:58,081
You know, when I came here after the war,
Dudley was just a patch of dirt.

182
00:16:58,603 --> 00:17:02,482
I built that plant
and put my whole family to work there.

183
00:17:03,203 --> 00:17:07,037
We made this town one of the biggest
chicken processors in the nation.

184
00:17:07,763 --> 00:17:11,312
We couldn't have done that
with troublemakers and layabouts.

185
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:13,394
I assume you mean George Kearns.

186
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:18,955
Men like George Kearns don't build things.
They tend to tear 'em down.

187
00:17:19,203 --> 00:17:22,878
Then you're aware of his recommendation
to close down your plant?

188
00:17:22,963 --> 00:17:24,954
You know...

189
00:17:25,403 --> 00:17:29,476
...livin' a long life is a mixed blessing.

190
00:17:29,563 --> 00:17:34,000
You spend your youth trying to build
something for yourself and your family...

191
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:39,396
...and your community, only to watch it
all taken away from you at your old age.

192
00:17:41,003 --> 00:17:42,914
Still...

193
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:45,915
...I'm not ready to die just yet.

194
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,677
You go do your autopsy on Paula.

195
00:17:50,163 --> 00:17:53,235
I wanna know
what happened to my granddaughter.

196
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:11,472
I think we've got something here, Mulder.

197
00:18:11,563 --> 00:18:13,679
- Take a look.
- What am I looking at?

198
00:18:13,763 --> 00:18:15,913
A specimen from Paula's brain.

199
00:18:16,003 --> 00:18:19,757
She had a rare degenerative disorder
called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

200
00:18:19,843 --> 00:18:23,233
It's characterised by the formation
of holes in the brain tissue.

201
00:18:23,323 --> 00:18:28,795
- Why didn't they show up on her charts?
- Short of an autopsy, it's hard to diagnose.

202
00:18:28,883 --> 00:18:32,353
I've only seen infected tissue once,
back in medical school.

203
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:35,321
- Could it be why she attacked Jess Harold?
- Absolutely.

204
00:18:35,403 --> 00:18:39,794
Victims of Creutzfeldt-Jakob suffer from
progressive dementia, severe seizures.

205
00:18:39,883 --> 00:18:43,114
- Is it fatal?
- This girl would have been dead in months.

206
00:18:43,603 --> 00:18:48,040
Except that Paula Gray was no girl.
This is her personnel file. Check it out.

207
00:18:48,603 --> 00:18:51,515
It says here that
Paula Gray was born in 1948...

208
00:18:51,603 --> 00:18:55,881
...which means that this woman,
Chaco's granddaughter, was 47 years old.

209
00:18:56,963 --> 00:18:58,442
There must be a mistake.

210
00:18:58,523 --> 00:19:02,436
Let's find out. Her birth certificate
should be on file at the courthouse.

211
00:19:02,523 --> 00:19:07,517
Who knows, Scully? This could turn out
to be even more interesting than foxfire.

212
00:19:19,523 --> 00:19:24,233
The odds that they both had the same
disease are practically nonexistent.

213
00:19:24,323 --> 00:19:28,157
Creutzfeldt-Jakob can be hereditary,
but it's not communicable.

214
00:19:28,243 --> 00:19:32,202
That two unrelated people in one town
contracted the same rare disease is...

215
00:19:32,283 --> 00:19:37,152
A lot more likely than Paula Gray
being three years shy of her 50th birthday.

216
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,715
Mulder, look out!

217
00:19:47,003 --> 00:19:49,198
<i>(clucking)</i>

218
00:19:55,643 --> 00:19:57,873
Call an ambulance!

219
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,158
I'll try to get the driver out.

220
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:08,721
This is Federal Agent Scully.
I'd like to report an accident...

221
00:20:20,763 --> 00:20:26,440
I just got off the phone with Dr Randolph.
He said this driver had the same symptoms.

222
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:31,802
You're saying this is a third victim? You told
me <i>two</i> cases are statistically impossible.

223
00:20:31,883 --> 00:20:33,794
They would be.

224
00:20:33,883 --> 00:20:36,795
I just came up with a sick theory, Mulder.

225
00:20:36,883 --> 00:20:38,874
Ooh, I'm listening.

226
00:20:39,603 --> 00:20:44,279
You saw the feed grinders at the plant. What
if somebody put Kearns's body in there?

227
00:20:44,363 --> 00:20:49,642
This is a prion disease, so it may have passed
on to the chickens and whoever ate them.

228
00:20:49,723 --> 00:20:52,191
So anyone eating the chickens
would be at risk?

229
00:20:52,283 --> 00:20:57,562
It's possible. In England they incinerate cattle
to stop them passing on mad cow disease.

230
00:20:57,643 --> 00:21:00,111
These chickens
are shipped all over the country.

231
00:21:00,203 --> 00:21:04,833
If you're right, we'd be seeing an epidemic,
not just a few local cases.

232
00:21:05,563 --> 00:21:07,360
Sheriff?

233
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:11,837
What's wrong with this water?

234
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:17,675
Runoff from the plant.
Chicken litter, mostly. Some blood and parts.

235
00:21:17,763 --> 00:21:20,516
Was this river searched
after Kearns disappeared?

236
00:21:20,723 --> 00:21:23,112
Are you kiddin'? A needle in a haystack!

237
00:21:23,203 --> 00:21:26,161
I'd like it dragged as soon as possible.

238
00:21:27,163 --> 00:21:29,677
Why would you wanna do that?

239
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:32,072
To see what's in there.

240
00:21:32,163 --> 00:21:36,520
That's a filthy job, and I would first
like to know what you're lookin' for.

241
00:21:36,603 --> 00:21:38,798
Hopefully, nothing.

242
00:21:40,283 --> 00:21:44,322
Look, Sheriff, if you don't wanna do it,
I can get some of my men to do it.

243
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,394
I'll do it.

244
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,994
- Mulder...
- It's just a hunch.

245
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:53,473
If Kearns didn't run off,
if he was murdered for that report...

246
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:56,236
...then his body's gotta be somewhere.

247
00:22:13,843 --> 00:22:17,119
We closed the spillway
and the water level dropped.

248
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:21,037
- They came up with it almost immediately.
- Did you find Kearns?

249
00:22:21,123 --> 00:22:23,432
Maybe you'd better see for yourself.

250
00:22:56,523 --> 00:23:01,153
Sheriff Arens is outside.
They're <i>still</i> pulling bones from the river.

251
00:23:01,243 --> 00:23:04,997
Well, so far I've been able
to isolate nine distinct skeletons.

252
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,677
This one belonged to the late George Kearns.

253
00:23:08,003 --> 00:23:11,996
- How do you know?
- The pin... in his femur.

254
00:23:13,443 --> 00:23:18,597
According to his medical file,
Kearns broke his right leg four years ago.

255
00:23:18,683 --> 00:23:22,961
- What about the others?
- I'll need more sophisticated equipment...

256
00:23:23,043 --> 00:23:27,275
...but I estimate that some of these bones
are as much as 20 or 30 years old.

257
00:23:27,883 --> 00:23:31,273
All of them share one strange detail, though.

258
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:35,360
- They seem to have lost their heads.
- Besides that.

259
00:23:36,803 --> 00:23:40,512
The older bones show signs of decay
and abrasion, like you'd expect.

260
00:23:40,603 --> 00:23:46,599
But for some reason all of them, even
Kearns's, are smooth and buffed at the ends.

261
00:23:50,483 --> 00:23:52,997
It's almost like they've been polished.

262
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,153
It could be erosion from the water...

263
00:23:55,243 --> 00:23:58,280
Well, that water had hardly any current.

264
00:23:58,363 --> 00:24:02,561
This level of erosion wouldn't be confined
to just the ends of the bones.

265
00:24:03,523 --> 00:24:05,718
- Any theories?
- Maybe.

266
00:24:08,723 --> 00:24:10,475
Sheriff...

267
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:14,282
- Doris.
- Is it true? Just tell me.

268
00:24:14,363 --> 00:24:18,038
- Doris, I want you to listen to me.
- They found him, didn't they?

269
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:21,918
We brought up quite a few remains
at the river this afternoon.

270
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:24,392
George's were among them.

271
00:24:25,243 --> 00:24:26,642
I'm sorry.

272
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:30,200
Listen, I'm really sorry. It's gonna be all right.

273
00:24:30,283 --> 00:24:32,956
Don't worry, Doris. We'll take care of you.

274
00:24:33,043 --> 00:24:34,954
Doris?

275
00:24:35,323 --> 00:24:37,598
- Dee, that the new schedule?
- Yeah.

276
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:43,354
Looks good.

277
00:25:04,363 --> 00:25:07,560
Why do I get the feeling
you're not here to check up on my neck?

278
00:25:07,643 --> 00:25:11,033
- They found bones in the river.
- I know. I heard.

279
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:15,601
Did you also hear that Clayton Walsh
came down with the symptoms? That's four.

280
00:25:15,683 --> 00:25:18,675
It's getting worse
with every day that goes by.

281
00:25:20,003 --> 00:25:24,440
- Someone has to tell Mr Chaco.
- He knows, but he's not doing anything.

282
00:25:26,763 --> 00:25:29,755
- Maybe I should talk to him.
- You can try.

283
00:25:30,803 --> 00:25:33,556
I <i>will</i> talk to him. He'll listen to me.

284
00:25:35,163 --> 00:25:37,154
And if he doesn't?

285
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:54,999
I had Danny run a check on missing persons
last seen within a 200-mile radius of Dudley.

286
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:59,361
In the last 50 years
87 people have disappeared near here.

287
00:25:59,443 --> 00:26:05,518
Judging from the forensic evidence, I'd say
the same person or persons was responsible.

288
00:26:05,603 --> 00:26:08,163
<i>(Scully)</i> It may have been the work of a cult.

289
00:26:08,243 --> 00:26:13,840
Scully, I think that the good people of Dudley
have been eating more than just chicken.

290
00:26:16,123 --> 00:26:19,433
- You think these people were eaten?
- Look at these bones.

291
00:26:19,523 --> 00:26:23,402
They've been polished at both ends,
suggesting they were boiled in a pot.

292
00:26:23,483 --> 00:26:25,872
Anthropologists used similar evidence...

293
00:26:25,963 --> 00:26:29,842
...to prove cannibalism among
the Anasazi tribe of New Mexico.

294
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:35,839
Then Paula Gray may have contracted
Creutzfeldt-Jakob by eating George Kearns.

295
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:40,641
- That could explain her youthful appearance.
- What are you talking about?

296
00:26:40,723 --> 00:26:44,079
Some cannibalistic rituals
are believed to prolong life.

297
00:26:44,163 --> 00:26:47,633
Cannibalism is one thing,
but increasing longevity by it...

298
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:52,832
Think about it, Scully. From vampirism
to Catholicism, literally or symbolically...

299
00:26:52,923 --> 00:26:57,394
...the reward for eating flesh is eternal life.
I don't know how it works, but we saw Paula.

300
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,519
We never confirmed her date of birth.

301
00:26:59,603 --> 00:27:05,041
Maybe the courthouse records can tell us if
she, or anybody else, is lying about their age.

302
00:27:09,483 --> 00:27:11,474
You coming?

303
00:27:19,163 --> 00:27:21,723
<i>(Jess)</i> You gotta do something, Mr Chaco.

304
00:27:22,443 --> 00:27:26,152
People are gettin' scared.
They don't know what to make of things.

305
00:27:26,243 --> 00:27:28,632
They're losing faith is what it sounds like.

306
00:27:28,723 --> 00:27:31,874
It's gettin' hard to hold on to,
the way things are goin'.

307
00:27:31,963 --> 00:27:35,592
- Three more got sick since yesterday.
- I lost my granddaughter in this!

308
00:27:35,683 --> 00:27:38,675
So don't tell me what we're up against!

309
00:27:39,403 --> 00:27:41,394
Now, I said I'd handle it.

310
00:27:41,483 --> 00:27:43,474
- I know you...
- <i>(doorbell)</i>

311
00:27:46,763 --> 00:27:48,913
- Yes?
- I need to see Mr Chaco.

312
00:27:49,483 --> 00:27:51,155
Doris.

313
00:27:56,043 --> 00:27:59,558
I can't do this any more, Mr Chaco.
I can't keep lyin'.

314
00:27:59,643 --> 00:28:03,397
It's all right. Jess told me what happened.

315
00:28:03,563 --> 00:28:06,999
- You have nothing to worry about.
- But they're gonna think <i>I did it.

316
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:10,439
- No, they won't think any such thing.
- But I did!

317
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,320
- No.
- I helped!

318
00:28:12,403 --> 00:28:17,352
He was no good, Doris.
He had no values. He didn't fit in here.

319
00:28:17,443 --> 00:28:22,471
- But he was my husband.
- That was the price that you had to pay.

320
00:28:22,563 --> 00:28:25,873
- You knew that from the beginning.
- But those FBI agents...

321
00:28:25,963 --> 00:28:29,353
Uh-uh. This town wasn't built in a day.

322
00:28:29,923 --> 00:28:32,153
It's not about to fall apart in a day.

323
00:28:32,563 --> 00:28:36,476
No, you're a part of us now.
And we're gonna take good care of you.

324
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:40,680
Now, I want you to go home, get some rest.

325
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:43,482
You've got a funeral to go to.

326
00:28:43,563 --> 00:28:48,762
This whole thing'll blow over soon enough
and you'll wonder what all the fuss is about.

327
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:52,475
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

328
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:55,794
We all understand, Doris. Good night.

329
00:29:07,363 --> 00:29:09,672
Yeah, she'll be fine.

330
00:29:09,763 --> 00:29:14,598
- She's not stable.
- She's one of us now. Part of our town.

331
00:29:15,363 --> 00:29:18,878
Unless we do something about her,
there won't be any town left.

332
00:29:18,963 --> 00:29:20,954
No!

333
00:29:21,043 --> 00:29:25,639
Once we start turning on ourselves,
we're no better than the animals.

334
00:29:27,123 --> 00:29:29,921
It's the FBI we should be worryin' about.

335
00:29:30,923 --> 00:29:33,118
They're the real problem.

336
00:29:57,723 --> 00:30:00,715
<i>(Mulder)</i> Someone's been
playing with matches.

337
00:30:03,523 --> 00:30:05,514
Smells like a recent fire.

338
00:30:07,603 --> 00:30:11,642
<i>(Mulder)</i> I bet it's no coincidence
it only hit the birth records.

339
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:14,191
<i>(Scully)</i> You think
someone was expecting us?

340
00:30:17,523 --> 00:30:19,514
<i>(phone rings)</i>

341
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:26,793
- Mulder.
- It's Doris Kearns.

342
00:30:26,883 --> 00:30:30,671
I'm in my house.
I need to speak with you right away.

343
00:30:30,803 --> 00:30:34,000
- Are you all right?
- <i>I'm afraid for my life.</i>

344
00:30:35,563 --> 00:30:37,554
I'm afraid he'll kill me.

345
00:30:37,643 --> 00:30:39,440
<i>Who?</i>

346
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:44,919
- Mr Chaco.
- <i>All right, Mrs Kearns.</i>

347
00:30:45,003 --> 00:30:48,632
Stay in the house. Don't answer
the door until Agent Scully arrives.

348
00:30:50,403 --> 00:30:53,520
- Where are you going?
- To take Chaco into custody.

349
00:30:58,883 --> 00:31:00,680
Oh!

350
00:31:07,523 --> 00:31:09,514
<i>(hysterical muttering)</i>

351
00:31:12,563 --> 00:31:14,838
No...

352
00:31:15,443 --> 00:31:17,434
<i>(screams)</i>

353
00:31:44,683 --> 00:31:46,674
<i>(rings doorbell)</i>

354
00:31:47,883 --> 00:31:49,475
Mrs Kearns?

355
00:32:08,683 --> 00:32:10,674
Mrs Kearns?

356
00:32:34,403 --> 00:32:36,394
Mrs Kearns?

357
00:32:39,683 --> 00:32:42,072
- <i>(wind howls)</i>
- <i>(gasps)</i>

358

<i>(doorbell)</i>

359
00:33:08,163 --> 00:33:11,280
- Is Mr Chaco in?
- I'll see if he's still awake.

360
00:34:06,203 --> 00:34:10,276
I'm sorry, but Mr Chaco
is unable to see you now.

361
00:34:10,363 --> 00:34:12,479
- D'you know what's in here?
- No.

362
00:34:12,563 --> 00:34:14,952
- Can you open it?
- I don't have the key.

363
00:34:26,283 --> 00:34:28,274
What do you think you're doin'?!

364
00:34:49,683 --> 00:34:51,674
<i>(phone rings)</i>

365
00:34:53,243 --> 00:34:56,315
- Scully.
- Scully, Chaco's not here.

366
00:34:56,403 --> 00:35:00,601
Yeah. Mrs Kearns is missing, too, Mulder.
I think someone's been here.

367
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:05,040
The power's been cut and the back door
was wide open. Her car is still out back.

368
00:35:05,923 --> 00:35:08,118
- Chaco must've taken her.
- <i>(clatter)</i>

369
00:35:08,203 --> 00:35:10,512
Scully? Scully!

370
00:35:10,803 --> 00:35:14,432
<i>Scully! What happened?</i>
<i>Scully, are you there?</i>

371
00:35:14,523 --> 00:35:16,115
<i>You all right?</i>

372
00:35:16,203 --> 00:35:18,000
<i>Scully!</i>

373
00:35:18,763 --> 00:35:20,754
Answer me! Scully!

374
00:36:01,883 --> 00:36:04,272
<i>(Chaco)</i> What have you done here?

375
00:36:05,283 --> 00:36:07,114
I warned ya!

376
00:36:07,203 --> 00:36:09,592
I said not to touch her!

377
00:36:09,683 --> 00:36:12,402
Doris Kearns was one of us!

378
00:36:12,483 --> 00:36:14,474
Who's behind this?

379
00:36:22,323 --> 00:36:26,953
Why didn't you listen? It's the outsiders
we have to deal with, not one of our own.

380
00:36:27,043 --> 00:36:29,352
We'll deal with them all.

381
00:36:29,443 --> 00:36:33,800
Look at yourselves!
Look at what you've become!

382
00:36:33,883 --> 00:36:37,239
This isn't faith any more. It's just fear.

383
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:39,399
You've become an abomination!

384
00:36:39,563 --> 00:36:42,202
<i>You</i> brought in the outsider
who made us sick.

385
00:36:42,563 --> 00:36:45,760
Once you turn on yourselves, it's over.

386
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:50,360
How long before it's any one of us?

387
00:36:53,483 --> 00:36:55,360
Any one of you?!

388
00:36:56,163 --> 00:36:58,836
That's not your problem any more, Mr Chaco.

389
00:37:01,843 --> 00:37:03,595
<i>(Chaco)</i> No!

390

No!

Kill me...

392
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:20,158
