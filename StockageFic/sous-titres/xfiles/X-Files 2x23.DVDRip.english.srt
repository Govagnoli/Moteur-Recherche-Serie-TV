1
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,314
Morris?

2
00:01:19,003 --> 00:01:22,040
Morris, I need to talk to you!

3
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,717
Morris, it's me. Are you in there?

4
00:01:25,643 --> 00:01:27,634
Morris?

5
00:01:28,843 --> 00:01:31,755
Morris, if you're in there,
open the damn door!

6
00:01:33,043 --> 00:01:36,240
Morris! Morris, open up!

7
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:42,114
Morris, I need to talk to you!

8
00:01:42,523 --> 00:01:45,321
Gail Anne is dead. It was my fault.

9
00:01:48,603 --> 00:01:50,594
Morris!

10
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,438
Morris, I need to talk to you.

11
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:03,279
Come to the door, Morris, please.
Answer the door, dammit!

12
00:02:14,363 --> 00:02:15,955
- Oh, no!
- <i>(Morris wails)</i>

13
00:02:18,643 --> 00:02:20,554
No.

14
00:02:20,643 --> 00:02:23,362
Oh, God, no! No, God!

15
00:02:25,923 --> 00:02:27,959
God, no.

16
00:02:28,043 --> 00:02:30,637
No, no, no, no, no.

17
00:02:30,723 --> 00:02:32,714
Please, no. Please!

18
00:03:19,563 --> 00:03:22,873
Two apparent abductions
in a month, then this one.

19
00:03:22,963 --> 00:03:27,912
My contact says the Richmond PD's hit
a brick wall, so I said we'd have a look.

20
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:29,994
- Who's your contact?
- Kelly Ryan.

21
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,551
She was one of my students at the academy.

22
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:34,713
She's been bumped up to detective...

23
00:03:34,803 --> 00:03:39,354
...and she's nervous about her supervisor
finding out the FBI are involved.

24
00:03:39,443 --> 00:03:41,434
- Kelly?
- Agent Scully.

25
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:45,833
- Hi. This is Agent Mulder.
- Hi. Thank you for coming.

26
00:03:45,923 --> 00:03:48,835
- You're welcome.
- Heard a lot about <i>you.</i>

27
00:03:48,923 --> 00:03:50,914
We'll talk later.

28
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:55,641
The missing man is Patrick Newirth, aged 52.

29
00:03:55,723 --> 00:03:59,432
He's a top executive with Morley Tobacco,
up here for a meeting.

30
00:03:59,523 --> 00:04:02,640
- He arrived by train.
- How do you know he's missing?

31
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:06,716
He set a wake-up call for 6am.
The operator tried, but got no answer.

32
00:04:06,803 --> 00:04:09,681
Mm. Scotch. It looks like
he barely touched it.

33
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:14,962
Needless to say, he missed his meeting.
After three hours, they sent hotel security up.

34
00:04:15,043 --> 00:04:20,834
The door was locked, security chain fastened.
And when they broke in, no Patrick Newirth.

35
00:04:20,923 --> 00:04:23,198
- Windows?
- Locked from the inside.

36
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:27,402
We're six storeys up, no fire escape.
No way in or out of this room.

37
00:04:28,203 --> 00:04:32,276
- Agent Scully, what are you lookin' at?
- Uh, the heat register.

38
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:36,791
- You think anyone could squeeze in there?
- You never know.

39
00:04:37,723 --> 00:04:41,602
- You guys turn up any forensics evidence?
- Uh, just this.

40
00:04:46,843 --> 00:04:50,119
- Scully, look at this.
- What is it?

41
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:54,321
We don't know. The hotel claims
it wasn't here before Mr Newirth checked in.

42
00:04:54,603 --> 00:04:58,073
There were similar burn marks
at the previous crime scenes.

43
00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:02,714
- Was Patrick Newirth a smoker?
- No. His wife says he loathed cigarettes.

44
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:06,434
- Yet he worked for a tobacco company.
- Did you run a test on it?

45
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:10,072
Yes, sir. Mostly carbon,
with some potassium and trace minerals.

46
00:05:10,163 --> 00:05:14,600
- Could be residue from burnt human flesh.
- Does this look like an arm to anybody?

47
00:05:15,843 --> 00:05:18,437
- An arm?
- What are you thinkin', Mulder?

48
00:05:19,963 --> 00:05:23,922
This burn mark is right where
I'd stand to answer the door, right?

49
00:05:24,003 --> 00:05:26,961
- <i>(Scully)</i> Yes.
- And I'd only look out the peephole...

50
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:31,321
...if there was something to look at, right?
- That makes sense.

51
00:05:36,843 --> 00:05:40,358
- Could you have this bulb dusted for prints?
- Of course.

52
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:44,956
And can you run those against
Mr Newirth's? Do you have his prints?

53
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:47,477
From his toiletries and check-in slip.

54
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:51,351
Check them against
all hotel employees and guests.

55
00:05:51,443 --> 00:05:55,959
- Anything else?
- What's the name of the last missing person?

56
00:05:56,043 --> 00:05:58,511
That would be Margaret Wysnecki.

57
00:05:58,603 --> 00:06:00,833
Thanks. This should do it.

58
00:06:00,923 --> 00:06:03,153
Is this your first case, Detective?

59
00:06:04,683 --> 00:06:07,481
- Yes, sir.
- Any idea why they gave it to you?

60
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:11,233
No one else wanted it.

61
00:06:11,323 --> 00:06:15,316
Because of the lack of evidence,
this is still a missing persons case...

62
00:06:15,403 --> 00:06:18,156
...not likely to end up on the front pages.

63
00:06:18,243 --> 00:06:20,837
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

64
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:24,357
Can I ask what you think
may have happened?

65
00:06:24,443 --> 00:06:28,356
At first blush?
Spontaneous human combustion.

66
00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:33,914
You're doing just fine.

67
00:06:34,403 --> 00:06:36,997
- Having a little fun?
- What do you mean?

68
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:41,395
- Spontaneous human combustion?
- I have case files of bodies reduced to ash...

69
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:45,635
...with no attendant burning or melting.
Rapid oxidation without heat.

70
00:06:45,723 --> 00:06:49,716
Let's forget that there's
no scientific theory to support it.

71
00:06:49,803 --> 00:06:51,794
OK.

72
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:27,796
Hey, Scully. Can you spare a prophylactic?

73
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,034
What are the odds of that, huh?

74
00:07:42,123 --> 00:07:44,683
Darkness covers a multitude of sins.

75
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:50,362
Check this out. My newest tool
in the fight against crime.

76
00:07:50,443 --> 00:07:53,321
$49.95 at your local hardware store.

77
00:07:53,403 --> 00:07:57,555
Neat trick. For your birthday,
I'll buy you a utility belt.

78
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:09,593
- Look at this, Mulder.
- Hm. What do we know about the victim?

79
00:08:09,683 --> 00:08:12,322
Margaret Wysnecki, aged 66.

80
00:08:12,403 --> 00:08:17,158
Widowed, retired from Laramie Tobacco,
where she worked for 36 years.

81
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:20,440
Tobacco? Patrick Newirth
worked for Morley Tobacco.

82
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:23,959
Half of Richmond earns their paycheck
making cancer sticks.

83
00:08:24,043 --> 00:08:26,682
- Could be just a coincidence.
- Yeah, probably.

84
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:32,315
The first missing person, Gail Anne Lambert,
worked for Polarity Magnetics Inc.

85
00:08:35,323 --> 00:08:39,760
They didn't find any prints. Why should
the prints on the bulb mean anything?

86
00:08:39,843 --> 00:08:41,834
I don't know.

87
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:50,312
Oh, look at this, Scully.
Someone forgot to empty the trash.

88
00:08:52,483 --> 00:08:57,432
M Wysnecki, round trip to Hampton Roads,
Virginia. Return train dated March 17th.

89
00:08:57,523 --> 00:09:01,232
- The day she disappeared.
- Patrick Newirth came by train.

90
00:09:01,323 --> 00:09:03,518
And Gail Anne Lambert...

91
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:08,194
Uh, no. Nothing here
puts her near the train station.

92
00:09:08,283 --> 00:09:11,912
- Maybe that detail was overlooked.
- What's the significance?

93
00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:17,714
Maybe these people are being hunted,
and the hunter's working the train station.

94
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:20,442
What about spontaneous
human combustion?

95
00:09:20,523 --> 00:09:23,879
Maybe it's not spontaneous.
Call your young detective...

96
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:27,399
...and tell her to get a detail
down to the train station.

97
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:28,596
<i>(policeman)</i> Suspicious male in the alley
behind the station. I'm gonna check him out.

98
00:10:28,683 --> 00:10:31,436
<i>(police radio) Roger that, 64. I'm on my way.</i>

99
00:10:32,043 --> 00:10:34,034
Sir, could I speak with you?

100
00:10:35,523 --> 00:10:38,435
Hold on! I only wanna ask you
a couple of questions!

101
00:10:38,523 --> 00:10:41,879
All right, stop right there.
Don't move. Just hold it.

102
00:10:42,363 --> 00:10:44,354
Put your hands in the air, sir.

103
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:49,552
Stay... away from me.

104
00:10:51,803 --> 00:10:55,159
What do you think you're doin'?
Come on outta there.

105
00:10:55,243 --> 00:10:57,473
We just wanna talk to you.

106
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,797
Stay away from me. I don't wanna hurt you.

107
00:11:02,043 --> 00:11:04,398
- Move it.
- Hands where we can see them.

108
00:11:15,203 --> 00:11:17,876
Please... I'm warning you.

109
00:11:18,883 --> 00:11:23,798
- I'm a dangerous man.
- Keep movin', pal, out where we can see ya.

110
00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:32,601
All right. I want you to
lie face down on the ground.

111
00:11:33,603 --> 00:11:35,639
Don't... come any closer.

112
00:11:36,443 --> 00:11:38,673
Get down on the ground, sir. Now!

113
00:11:39,643 --> 00:11:41,918
Please! You don't understand.

114
00:11:42,163 --> 00:11:43,562
<i>(screams)</i>

115
00:11:44,243 --> 00:11:46,552
- Oh, God! No!
- Barney?

116
00:11:48,523 --> 00:11:50,434
Don't! No! Stay away!

117
00:11:50,523 --> 00:11:51,922
<i>(screams)</i>

118
00:11:55,963 --> 00:11:58,033
Oh, God!

119
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:01,672
Oh, God! Not again!

120
00:12:02,563 --> 00:12:05,680
No! No! No! No!

121
00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:30,081
- What happened here, Kelly?
- I sent two patrolmen down here.

122
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:33,394
They lost radio contact
with them just after midnight.

123
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:37,158
- All they found was two more scorch marks.
- Nothing else?

124
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:41,714
No. Suddenly this could be a cop-killer case,
and I'm indirectly responsible.

125
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:46,399
- You were just doing yourjob.
- They wanna know why I sent these men.

126
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:50,396
- If I tell them I've involved you, they'll snap.
- Those prints?

127
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:53,395
I ran it against all
the hotel staff and guests...

128
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:56,600
...then through the national
databases. No match.

129
00:12:58,883 --> 00:13:02,273
- Some first case, huh?
- Make sure you hang on to this case.

130
00:13:02,363 --> 00:13:04,319
I'm sure something will turn up.

131
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:08,392
- These ideas of yours. Care to share them?
- Not yet.

132
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:13,113
- You don't have a clue, do you?
- He was here, Scully. I was right about that.

133
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:21,282
- So where does this leave us?
- Maybe with enough to identify the killer.

134
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:24,082
- How?
- He was here last night.

135
00:13:24,163 --> 00:13:28,122
He was also probably here
on March 17th and March 31st.

136
00:13:28,203 --> 00:13:31,001
The days that the other
two people disappeared.

137
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,439
That leaves us with three days
of station video tapes to check...

138
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:39,643
...and hopefully find out who this guy is.
- That's assuming we're looking for a guy.

139
00:13:39,723 --> 00:13:42,999
Either way, the security camera's
our only witness.

140
00:13:48,683 --> 00:13:51,436
It could be any one of these people, Mulder.

141
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:53,718
Or none of them.

142
00:13:53,803 --> 00:13:57,921
We've gone through the entire week
and I'm still not sure how to find him.

143
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,756
That's it for March 22nd on the arrival deck.

144
00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:03,915
- Let's go back to the terminal tape.
- Again?

145
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,593
He's gotta be on at least one tape.

146
00:14:06,683 --> 00:14:10,278
Chances are he's not carrying
a sign with an arrow on it.

147
00:14:10,363 --> 00:14:12,354
There you go.

148
00:14:15,763 --> 00:14:18,596
See this guy, right here? He's always here.

149
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:20,958
What's he doing?

150
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:24,794
- Looking at the floor.
- Why's he doin' that?

151
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:30,198
Probably the same reason he spends
his whole afternoon in the train station.

152
00:14:30,843 --> 00:14:33,835
- Can you freeze this and blow it up 200%?
- Sure.

153
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:42,160
OK. Can you reframe
and blow it up some more?

154
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:46,118
See, he's got something on his jacket.

155
00:14:46,203 --> 00:14:49,001
<i>(security guard)</i> Let's see if I can pull it up.

156
00:14:52,243 --> 00:14:56,122
- Polarity Magnetics.
- That's where the first victim worked.

157
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:13,474
Looks like it's been closed up.

158
00:15:15,003 --> 00:15:18,359
- Yes?
- We're Agents Mulder and Scully, FBI.

159
00:15:19,923 --> 00:15:23,279
We're looking for a man
who may have worked here.

160
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:29,720
- When was this taken?
- March 22nd. Do you know him?

161
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:33,396
Sure I know him. Dr Chester Banton.

162
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:37,522
- He was my business partner.
- You mean he's not any more?

163
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:40,872
I don't know. I would assume not.

164
00:15:40,963 --> 00:15:43,841
This is the first I've seen of him in five weeks.

165
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:47,677
- I wondered if he wasn't gonna turn up dead.
- How's that?

166
00:15:47,763 --> 00:15:51,119
Chester was involved
in a terrible accident here.

167
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:58,520
Polarity Magnetics does, or did,
primarily two kinds of research.

168
00:15:58,603 --> 00:16:02,676
Mostly we designed maglev applications -
people movers, bullet trains.

169
00:16:02,803 --> 00:16:08,116
But, for Chester, thatjust paid the bills
for the theoretical stuff he was interested in.

170
00:16:08,203 --> 00:16:10,763
- Which was what?
- Researching dark matter.

171
00:16:10,843 --> 00:16:14,518
Quantum particles, neutrinos,
gluons, mesons, quarks.

172
00:16:14,603 --> 00:16:18,118
- Subatomic particles.
- The mysteries of the universe.

173
00:16:18,203 --> 00:16:22,640
- The very building blocks of reality.
- Except no one knows if they exist.

174
00:16:22,723 --> 00:16:24,714
Chester was sure they did.

175
00:16:24,803 --> 00:16:27,397
So sure, he bet his life on it.

176
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:36,477
This is where it happened. Chester
was working to isolate a new particle.

177
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:40,636
- He'd been working on it for a year.
- This is a particle accelerator.

178
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:44,557
One fifth the power of the Texas
Supercollider in the space of a Wal-Mart.

179
00:16:44,643 --> 00:16:47,476
- Powered by what?
- A couple of billion megawatts.

180
00:16:47,563 --> 00:16:51,476
- Virginia Power loved us.
- Exactly what happened here?

181
00:16:51,563 --> 00:16:55,351
The work involved bombarding
beta particles with an alpha target...

182
00:16:55,443 --> 00:16:57,354
...negative against positive.

183
00:16:57,443 --> 00:17:03,040
Chester had started the countdown
when he realised he'd made a mistake.

184
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:06,240
Something needed readjusting
in the target room.

185
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:09,474
Except you can't stop
the countdown once you've begun.

186
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:12,316
There <i>was</i> time to safely make the change...

187
00:17:12,403 --> 00:17:16,715
...but I had left the room for a minute
when Chester decided to go in.

188
00:17:17,723 --> 00:17:22,672
I didn't realise until it was too late
that the door had locked behind him.

189
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:40,274
Look at this.

190
00:17:40,683 --> 00:17:44,881
As far as I can tell, it burned
Chester's shadow right into the wall.

191
00:17:45,363 --> 00:17:48,116
- How did he survive?
- All I can figure is...

192
00:17:48,203 --> 00:17:51,752
...the quanta liberated off the target
have virtually no mass.

193
00:17:51,843 --> 00:17:55,472
- They slid right through his body.
- Like getting an X-ray.

194
00:17:55,563 --> 00:17:57,838
A two-billion-megawatt X-ray.

195
00:17:57,923 --> 00:18:00,881
When I saw on the monitor
what was happening...

196
00:18:00,963 --> 00:18:04,035
...that Chester was trapped in here, I panicked.

197
00:18:04,123 --> 00:18:06,273
I cut the power, but it was too late.

198
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,234
I remember looking, and... seeing Chester.

199
00:18:11,963 --> 00:18:13,954
He was perfectly calm...

200
00:18:14,043 --> 00:18:16,238
...almost like he wanted it to happen.

201
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:20,756
Like he was finally going to experience
the dark matter he had theorised...

202
00:18:20,843 --> 00:18:23,118
...in some kind of physical way.

203
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,798
As if the truth might come into him.

204
00:18:30,323 --> 00:18:32,359
Excuse me.

205
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:35,194
What do you think, Scully?

206
00:18:36,563 --> 00:18:41,478
Well, this looks like the same kind of
material found at the other crime scenes.

207
00:18:41,803 --> 00:18:45,159
Maybe it <i>is</i> some kind of
spontaneous human combustion.

208
00:18:45,243 --> 00:18:47,234
I'm less convinced of that now.

209
00:18:47,883 --> 00:18:50,397
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know.

210
00:18:50,883 --> 00:18:56,480
<i>Whatever it is, it's connected to the person of</i>
<i>Dr Chester Banton. Maybe even part of him.</i>

211
00:18:56,563 --> 00:18:59,873
<i>(Scully) Well, whatever it is,</i>
<i>we have to find him.</i>

212
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:03,080
<i>I know of only one place to start lookin'.</i>

213
00:19:19,763 --> 00:19:23,756
There's no sign of him, Mulder.
Maybe he's moved on.

214
00:19:24,683 --> 00:19:28,835
- What are you looking at?
- On the tape, he kept staring at the floor.

215
00:19:28,923 --> 00:19:32,040
I'm trying to figure out
what he might have been looking at.

216
00:19:32,123 --> 00:19:34,683
Maybe the exposure affected his mind.

217
00:19:34,763 --> 00:19:38,551
Nonsensical repetitive behaviour
is common in mental illness.

218
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:40,634
You trying to tell me something?

219
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:47,873
I called Detective Ryan. She's having the
prints on the bulbs checked against Banton's.

220
00:19:47,963 --> 00:19:50,079
Did you tell her about his accident?

221
00:19:50,163 --> 00:19:55,556
No. I only told her he was a possible suspect,
and that it was too early to get her hopes up.

222
00:19:55,643 --> 00:19:58,521
And that we have more
questions than answers.

223
00:19:58,603 --> 00:20:02,437
- Like?
- Like a motive. Like a murder weapon.

224
00:20:02,523 --> 00:20:04,798
- Like...
- What if Dr Banton...

225
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:08,241
Look here. There are
hardly any shadows cast.

226
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:11,599
- What do you mean?
- The lighting in here is diffused.

227
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:15,562
Soft light. What if that's what
Dr Banton was looking for?

228
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:17,634
<i>(Scully)</i> Looking for his shadow?

229
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,114
Dr Banton.

230
00:20:48,963 --> 00:20:51,113
Stop right there!

231
00:20:51,403 --> 00:20:53,394
Dr Banton!

232
00:20:58,043 --> 00:21:00,716
Please... just leave me alone.

233
00:21:01,003 --> 00:21:03,153
We're federal agents, Dr Banton.

234
00:21:03,243 --> 00:21:06,394
You don't understand.
You're making a big mistake.

235
00:21:07,563 --> 00:21:09,554
Stay away from me.

236
00:21:12,243 --> 00:21:13,756
Wait!

237
00:21:14,363 --> 00:21:17,116
It'll kill you. It doesn't care who you are.

238
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:27,474
Oh, thank God!

239
00:21:44,123 --> 00:21:47,672
- I thought he was to be kept in the dark.
- He insisted on soft light.

240
00:21:47,763 --> 00:21:50,960
It's the only way he'd let us open the door.

241
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:12,714
How can you even... begin
to understand what it's like?

242
00:22:12,803 --> 00:22:16,716
- We're trying to understand.
- Living in a train station day and night.

243
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:19,158
Living like a bum.

244
00:22:19,243 --> 00:22:22,519
Afraid to fall asleep
because of what might happen.

245
00:22:23,683 --> 00:22:26,675
The accident in the lab,
the quantum bombardment.

246
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:29,596
You believe that altered you physically?

247
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:32,151
You could... You could say that.

248
00:22:32,243 --> 00:22:34,234
Can you tell us how?

249
00:22:35,803 --> 00:22:38,397
Even if I could, you wouldn't understand.

250
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:44,921
- But it has something to do with dark matter.
- It has everything to do with dark matter.

251
00:22:45,003 --> 00:22:46,994
My shadow...

252
00:22:47,803 --> 00:22:49,794
...isn't mine.

253
00:22:50,923 --> 00:22:53,721
It's... It's like a black hole.

254
00:22:53,803 --> 00:22:56,636
It splits molecules into component atoms.

255
00:22:56,723 --> 00:23:02,241
It unzips electrons from their orbits,
reduces matter into pure energy.

256
00:23:02,643 --> 00:23:06,238
- That's how you killed Gail Anne Lambert?
- It wasn't me.

257
00:23:07,203 --> 00:23:09,319
Gail Anne was my colleague.

258
00:23:10,363 --> 00:23:12,354
She...

259
00:23:14,563 --> 00:23:17,953
The night after the accident, I went to see her.

260
00:23:20,403 --> 00:23:22,678
I was just standing in the doorway.

261
00:23:24,283 --> 00:23:27,719
I was... I was looking right at her.

262
00:23:29,483 --> 00:23:31,474
And then she was gone.

263
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:34,359
You have no control over it?

264
00:23:34,443 --> 00:23:38,994
If I could control it, do you think
I would let it go around killing people?

265
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:42,714
All I can do is...

266
00:23:43,483 --> 00:23:45,201
...study it.

267
00:23:45,283 --> 00:23:48,958
Try and divine its...
its true nature before <i>they</i> do.

268
00:23:49,523 --> 00:23:51,514
They?

269
00:23:52,443 --> 00:23:54,434
The government.

270
00:23:58,883 --> 00:24:00,874
They're after me.

271
00:24:02,363 --> 00:24:04,354
And when they find me...

272
00:24:05,283 --> 00:24:09,401
...they're going to do the brain suck
they've just been dying to do.

273
00:24:11,203 --> 00:24:13,922
"Brain suck"? For the purpose of?

274
00:24:14,163 --> 00:24:18,714
For the purpose of stealing what
has taken me years to accomplish.

275
00:24:18,803 --> 00:24:21,442
And don't think
they wouldn't kill to get it.

276
00:24:21,523 --> 00:24:24,595
But if they killed you,
wouldn't your shadow just...

277
00:24:24,683 --> 00:24:27,072
Disappear? Who knows?

278
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:34,517
That's why you have to get me out of here.

279
00:24:35,923 --> 00:24:41,441
If I die... there could be
nothing left to tether this thing.

280
00:24:41,683 --> 00:24:44,072
- <i>(door opens)</i>
- Excuse me.

281
00:24:44,163 --> 00:24:48,361
I'm gonna have to ask you to
discontinue interrogating the suspect.

282
00:25:00,243 --> 00:25:03,360
This is Detective Barron,
the primary on this case.

283
00:25:03,443 --> 00:25:07,436
- I was wondering what your involvement is.
- We caught the guy.

284
00:25:07,523 --> 00:25:12,881
I appreciate that. But no one seems to
recall inviting the FBI in on this case.

285
00:25:12,963 --> 00:25:16,160
Agent Mulder and I are here
in an unofficial capacity.

286
00:25:16,243 --> 00:25:18,234
Then who brought you in?

287
00:25:19,843 --> 00:25:23,631
We were curious about
the unexplained nature of the case.

288
00:25:24,563 --> 00:25:27,714
Banton's prints place him
at two of the crime scenes.

289
00:25:27,803 --> 00:25:32,672
And Transit Authority tapes show him in the
vicinity of two of the most recent victims.

290
00:25:32,763 --> 00:25:38,235
- I'd say this case is pretty much explained.
- Really? Have you talked to Dr Banton?

291
00:25:38,323 --> 00:25:41,998
Don't try to interrogate me,
Agent Mulder. I'm not the suspect.

292
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:45,996
You know nothing about this case,
so you stuck it with Detective Ryan.

293
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:51,157
- Let her decide how to proceed.
- She <i>is</i> handling this case. She's done well.

294
00:25:51,243 --> 00:25:55,759
I see no reason not to let her prosecute it
once the prisoner has been transferred.

295
00:25:55,843 --> 00:25:57,834
Transferred? Where?

296
00:25:58,283 --> 00:26:00,638
To the city jail, for his arraignment.

297
00:26:00,723 --> 00:26:04,079
I don't think you appreciate
the danger that he poses.

298
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:09,317
I don't think you have the authority to tell me
or anyone else in my unit how to do ourjob.

299
00:26:11,483 --> 00:26:14,122
I think we can handle it
from here, Agent Mulder.

300
00:26:14,203 --> 00:26:17,912
We'll call you if there's
anything more you can do.

301
00:26:18,003 --> 00:26:19,994
Come on, Mulder. Let's go.

302
00:26:22,403 --> 00:26:25,395
Soft light. He needs soft light.

303
00:26:28,163 --> 00:26:33,191
I hope you know what you're doing, putting
Detective Ryan's ambition over good sense.

304
00:26:33,283 --> 00:26:36,912
Ambition? She's a woman
trying to survive the boys' club.

305
00:26:37,003 --> 00:26:41,201
- Believe me, I know how she feels.
- You never put yourself ahead of your work.

306
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:43,353
And that's what's happening here.

307
00:26:43,443 --> 00:26:47,675
Look, the fact is, we have no jurisdiction
here. We were called in as a favour.

308
00:26:47,763 --> 00:26:50,516
And we just handed the A-bomb
to the Boy Scouts.

309
00:26:50,603 --> 00:26:52,798
I'm sure precautions will be taken.

310
00:26:52,883 --> 00:26:58,082
I'm sure Robert Oppenheimer heard that from
the same government Dr Banton is afraid of.

311
00:26:58,163 --> 00:27:00,757
You believe this paranoia
about brain sucking?

312
00:27:00,843 --> 00:27:03,915
That man is scared,
and notjust of his own shadow.

313
00:27:04,003 --> 00:27:07,678
As brilliant as Dr Banton may be,
he is also clearly delusional.

314
00:27:07,763 --> 00:27:13,759
- He shows almost every textbook indicator.
- We've both seen the physical evidence.

315
00:27:13,843 --> 00:27:17,961
Look, I don't know how to explain it.
But that's not ourjob.

316
00:27:18,043 --> 00:27:20,477
I don't know what else we should do.

317
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:23,472
I think <i>I do.

318
00:28:00,363 --> 00:28:03,196
All you've given me is a name.
Chester Ray Banton.

319
00:28:03,283 --> 00:28:06,639
- <i>Dr</i> Chester Ray Banton. Do you know him?
- No. Should I?

320
00:28:06,723 --> 00:28:11,080
He's being held by the police
in connection with several bizarre murders.

321
00:28:11,163 --> 00:28:15,361
He's a physicist, researching
quarks, gluons... Dark matter.

322
00:28:16,283 --> 00:28:21,755
- He thinks the government is out to get him.
- It's tax season. So do most Americans.

323
00:28:21,843 --> 00:28:25,119
- He believes his life is in danger.
- Is he a dangerous man?

324
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:25,523
Yes.

325
00:28:25,523 --> 00:28:27,195
Yes.

326
00:28:27,763 --> 00:28:31,153
- Where is he being held?
- Yaloff Psychiatric Hospital.

327
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:34,713
- But not for long.
- I'm afraid I can't help you.

328
00:28:34,803 --> 00:28:38,239
- Why?
- Last time I helped you, I bloodied my fist...

329
00:28:38,323 --> 00:28:42,396
...and regrettably exposed my identity
to associates of yours.

330
00:28:42,483 --> 00:28:46,396
Yes, I know. And you can trust them
as you trust me, I promise.

331
00:28:46,483 --> 00:28:48,519
Dead men can't keep promises.

332
00:28:49,403 --> 00:28:52,793
The next time, the blood
and regret could be yours.

333
00:28:52,883 --> 00:28:55,443
I'm not at your beck and call, Agent Mulder.

334
00:28:55,523 --> 00:28:59,198
I have nothing to gain and
everything to lose by helping you.

335
00:28:59,283 --> 00:29:03,401
Promise you won't contact me again
unless absolutely necessary.

336
00:29:10,563 --> 00:29:12,554
I promise.

337
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:44,436
Frank, are your lights on? Ours just went...

338
00:29:46,843 --> 00:29:50,279
Hi. We're here to transfer
Chester Ray Banton.

339
00:29:51,003 --> 00:29:53,756
I have orders he's being
transferred tomorrow.

340
00:29:53,843 --> 00:29:58,041
Due to the power outage,
there's been a change of plans.

341
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:01,161
No one's supposed to go in there!

342
00:30:11,323 --> 00:30:13,314
Here.

343
00:30:14,723 --> 00:30:16,714
Quickly.

344
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:20,002
Who are you?

345
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:22,278
No. Don't do this.

346
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:24,923
Please, no. No, don't. Leave me alone.

347
00:30:34,923 --> 00:30:37,232
<i>(man screams)</i>

348
00:31:36,643 --> 00:31:41,080
- What did you find out, Scully?
- Richmond PD had two officers outside.

349
00:31:41,163 --> 00:31:45,156
- They didn't see anybody come in.
- The nurse said there were three men.

350
00:31:45,243 --> 00:31:46,961
Three?

351
00:31:47,763 --> 00:31:51,119
The power was disconnected
at a substation two blocks away.

352
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:53,478
Somebody posing as a city engineer.

353
00:31:53,563 --> 00:31:58,796
Somebody who knew how to take it off the
grid without affecting surrounding facilities.

354
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:02,080
Somebody from the government
coming for Dr Banton?

355
00:32:02,163 --> 00:32:04,472
Being paranoid doesn't mean he's wrong.

356
00:32:04,563 --> 00:32:07,760
But my guess is they failed,
and Dr Banton's on the loose.

357
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,994
- That's what Detective Ryan thinks.
- I just saw her.

358
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:15,634
She was in charge of his transfer and
arraignment. She's in some pretty hot water.

359
00:32:15,723 --> 00:32:19,193
Maybe that was an appointment
he wasn't meant to keep. Let's go.

360
00:32:19,283 --> 00:32:24,403
- Where? Mulder, wait. Where are we going?
- You heard what Dr Banton said last night.

361
00:32:24,483 --> 00:32:27,236
- He said a lot of things.
- Put yourself in his head.

362
00:32:27,323 --> 00:32:31,521
He hasn't killed himself only because
he's afraid of releasing the dark matter.

363
00:32:31,603 --> 00:32:34,401
That's just a theory,
and a pretty wild one at that.

364
00:32:34,483 --> 00:32:38,920
Whether or not Dr Banton is actually
telling the truth, he believes he is.

365
00:32:39,003 --> 00:32:41,836
And so does whoever tried
to take him last night.

366
00:32:41,923 --> 00:32:44,721
All he's tried to do is control this thing.

367
00:32:44,803 --> 00:32:49,957
He'll go to the one place where he thinks
he can do that. And we gotta get there first.

368
00:33:09,603 --> 00:33:13,073
Don't turn on the light, Chris,
unless you wanna die.

369
00:33:13,163 --> 00:33:15,313
Chester, what the hell is going on?

370
00:33:15,403 --> 00:33:18,395
The FBI are looking for you.
Where have you been?

371
00:33:18,483 --> 00:33:21,441
There's no time to explain.
Just come with me.

372
00:33:21,523 --> 00:33:25,994
- What's this about? Talk to me.
- We found the dark matter, Chris. It's real.

373
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:29,792
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you understand? I'm it.

374
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:33,956
- It's... It's in me.
- The accident?

375
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:38,794
They're coming for me. We have to
destroy this thing before they get here.

376
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,874
No! You can't go back in there!

377
00:33:40,963 --> 00:33:44,842
Police! I'm placing you
under arrest, Dr Banton.

378
00:33:45,403 --> 00:33:49,157
- A lot of people will die if you do this.
- Step against the wall, sir.

379
00:33:50,163 --> 00:33:53,121
I'm begging you. I don't wanna hurt you.

380
00:33:53,403 --> 00:33:56,042
I said step against the wall.

381
00:33:56,123 --> 00:33:58,034
Now!

382
00:34:05,283 --> 00:34:07,114
I'm sorry.

383
00:34:16,803 --> 00:34:19,271
Let's go. We don't have much time.

384
00:34:38,963 --> 00:34:42,160
- Chester!
- No matter what they say to you later...

385
00:34:42,243 --> 00:34:44,234
...you're doing the right thing.

386
00:34:48,403 --> 00:34:50,394
Lock it up, Chris.

387
00:34:54,923 --> 00:34:57,562
All right. Let's get the accelerator on line.

388
00:34:57,643 --> 00:34:59,634
I'm afraid not, Chester.

389
00:35:01,723 --> 00:35:04,954
- You can do it, Chris.
- I can.

390
00:35:05,043 --> 00:35:07,034
But I'm not.

391
00:35:08,443 --> 00:35:11,640
No! Chris, tell me
you're not working for them.

392
00:35:12,283 --> 00:35:15,161
- Wish I could, Chester.
- You son of a bitch!

393
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:19,794
- Careful. We don't want you to hurt yourself.
- I'll die before I'll let them use me!

394
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:24,395
You're lightning in a bottle, Chester.
We're not about to let you die.

395
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:32,161
<i>Chris, don't do this. Listen to me!</i>

396
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:34,234
<i>This is wrong!</i>

397
00:35:34,403 --> 00:35:36,519
<i>You're making a terrible mistake!</i>

398
00:35:36,763 --> 00:35:40,392
I've got him. He's not goin'
anywhere till you pick him up.

399
00:35:41,163 --> 00:35:43,154
<i>(silenced gunshot)</i>

400
00:35:44,723 --> 00:35:46,475
Chris!

401
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:49,475
Chris? Chris! What's happening?

402
00:35:50,963 --> 00:35:52,954
Chris! Chris...

403
00:36:07,203 --> 00:36:11,515
- Mulder, that's Detective Ryan's car.
- I was afraid of this.

404
00:36:16,483 --> 00:36:18,474
Mulder.

405
00:36:20,163 --> 00:36:22,393
Dammit.

406
00:36:26,243 --> 00:36:28,234
<i>(electronic throbbing)</i>

407
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:31,554
What's that noise?

408
00:36:32,003 --> 00:36:33,994
It's the accelerator.

409
00:36:49,243 --> 00:36:51,234
Mulder!

410
00:37:09,803 --> 00:37:11,998
Scully, look at this.

411
00:37:16,603 --> 00:37:19,640
He must have killed her
and then killed himself.

412
00:37:19,723 --> 00:37:23,682
He couldn't have. This chamber's
been sealed from the outside.

413
00:37:24,483 --> 00:37:25,962
By who?

414
00:37:56,563 --> 00:37:58,679
Agent Mulder.

415
00:38:02,923 --> 00:38:05,915
I thought you agreed
not to contact me again about this.

416
00:38:06,003 --> 00:38:07,914
- You lied to me.
- About?

417
00:38:08,003 --> 00:38:11,359
About Chester Ray Banton.
You knew who he was.

418
00:38:11,443 --> 00:38:15,402
- And you used me to lead you to him.
- <i>You</i> contacted <i>me,</i> Agent Mulder.

419
00:38:15,483 --> 00:38:18,441
I won't be your stalking-horse,
or the government's.

420
00:38:18,523 --> 00:38:23,074
You seem to be mistaken about how much
control you exercise over this arrangement.

421
00:38:23,163 --> 00:38:25,802
You killed Dr Banton!

422
00:38:25,883 --> 00:38:29,319
- Have you lost your mind?
- The nurse identified you.

423
00:38:29,403 --> 00:38:31,917
A young detective is dead because of you.

424
00:38:32,003 --> 00:38:33,994
Who do you answer to?!

425
00:38:37,603 --> 00:38:40,242
Despite my loyalty to my predecessor...

426
00:38:40,323 --> 00:38:43,440
...I've never made you any promises.

427
00:38:43,763 --> 00:38:46,436
All right. Promise me somethin' right now.

428
00:38:46,883 --> 00:38:50,922
Promise me this'll be
our last meeting. We're finished.

429
00:38:51,003 --> 00:38:54,882
You're choosing a dangerous time
to go it alone, Agent Mulder.

430
00:38:57,283 --> 00:38:59,274
Mulder!

431
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,874
I didn't kill him.

432
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:30,433
The mourners are invited to pay their
respects to the family at the Ryan home.

433
00:40:08,963 --> 00:40:13,002
- How are you doin'?
- I'm not sure how to feel about this, Mulder.

434
00:40:13,123 --> 00:40:15,956
She was my student, and
she came to me for help.

435
00:40:18,443 --> 00:40:21,879
- I know it must be hard.
- This shouldn't have happened.

436
00:40:22,803 --> 00:40:24,873
This never should have happened.

437
00:40:26,563 --> 00:40:29,953
I'm sorry I'm late.
I got hung up at the Richmond PD.

438
00:40:30,043 --> 00:40:33,240
- Doing what?
- A missing-person report was filed...

439
00:40:33,323 --> 00:40:37,999
...by a Dr Morris West, a physicist
affiliated with Polarity Magnetics.

440
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:40,119
I'm not sure I follow you.

441
00:40:40,203 --> 00:40:45,357
Dr Christopher Davey hasn't been seen
or heard from since Banton disappeared.

442
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,753
- Do they have any leads?
- No. None.

443
00:40:49,003 --> 00:40:50,641
But you do?

444
00:40:50,723 --> 00:40:54,398
What if it wasn't Banton we saw
in the particle accelerator?

445
00:40:54,483 --> 00:40:57,998
Well, if Banton's not dead,
then where is he?

446
00:41:23,843 --> 00:41:26,562
Dr Davey would have been helpful to us.

447
00:41:26,723 --> 00:41:29,317
We'll be studying this man for a long time.
