I MIGHT HAVE SOME INSIGHT
INTO THIS INVISIBLE CREATURE
HE SAID WAS CHASING HIM.

00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:17,241
THE INVISIBLE MAN
WAS INVISIBLE.
RIGHT.

193
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:19,543
HE SAID HE WAS CHASED
BY A CREATURE
WITH GLOWING RED EYES.

194
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:22,696
LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

195
00:16:22,696 --> 00:16:25,499
MRS. ASEKOFF SAID SHE
WENT OUTSIDE WITH THE DOG.

196
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:28,502
WHEN SHE CAME BACK,
THE DOOR WAS LOCKED
FROM THE INSIDE.

00:16:28,502 --> 00:16:30,504
AND ?
LOOK AT THIS.

198
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:33,924
WE GOT
SOME TRACKS HERE.
WHERE ?

199
00:16:33,924 --> 00:16:36,176
HERE AND HERE.
DRIED MUD AGAINST THE TILE,

200
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:38,562
TRACKED IN
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

201
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:40,564
IT COULD'VE BEEN BROUGHT IN
BY THE DOG.
NO, NO.

202
00:16:41,064 --> 00:16:43,317
YOU SEE THE BALL
OF THE FOOT HERE ?
A LARGE FOOT.

203
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:46,620
- AND I COUNT FIVE TOES.
- WAIT, I THOUGHT YOU SAID
  IT WASN'T HUMAN.

204
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,556
I'M NOT SAYING IT IS.
THE WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION
IS ALL WRONG.

205
00:16:49,556 --> 00:16:54,861
PEOPLE WALK HEEL TO TOE.
WHATEVER THIS THING IS,
WALKS ON THE BALL OF ITS FOOT.

206
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:56,697
YOU'RE PUTTING ME ON.

207
00:16:56,697 --> 00:17:00,617
NO.  MY DAD AND I
WERE INDIAN GUIDES.
I KNOW THESE THINGS.

208
00:17:00,617 --> 00:17:04,338
SO IF IT'S NOT MAN
AND IT'S NOT ANIMAL,
WHAT THE HELL IS IT ?

209
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:06,423
GUESS I'M A LITTLE LATE
TO THIS DANCE.

210
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:09,826

RIGHT HERE.

00:17:09,826 --> 00:17:12,129
SAME AS I SAW BEFORE.

212
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:15,499
WHERE WAS THAT ?
IN THE WOODS.

213
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:19,503
WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION'S STRANGE.
THEY APPEAR TO BE HUMAN,

214
00:17:19,503 --> 00:17:22,789
BUT WHOEVER LEFT THESE
USES THE BALLS OF HIS FEET
MORE LIKE AN ANIMAL.

215
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:27,511
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S ATTACKED THREE GROWN MEN
PRESUMABLY IN BROAD DAYLIGHT,

DISPOSING OF ITS PREY
WITHOUT DETECTION.

217
00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:33,267
AND IT WASN'T SHY LAST NIGHT
ABOUT COMING OUT
OF THE WOODS TO TRY AGAIN.

218
00:17:33,267 --> 00:17:37,554
WHAT WE'VE GOT IS A PREDATOR
WITH LOW VISIBILITY AND
A HIGH DEGREE OF MOTIVATION.

219
00:17:37,554 --> 00:17:39,556
IT'S GOT ONE ADVANTAGE
WE DON'T HAVE--

220
00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:42,392
THE ENTIRE APPALACHICOLA
NATIONAL FOREST.

221
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:45,979
THEN HOW DO YOU STOP IT ?
BY IDENTIFYING IT.

222
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,732
FINDING IT BEFORE
IT FINDS SOMEBODY ELSE.

223
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:54,688
IT'S CALLED A "FLIR"
FOR FORWARD LOOKING INFRARED.

224

CHOPPER PILOTS IN VIETNAM.

ARE WE READY TO GO ?
ONCE WE START IN, YOU CAN
PUT AWAY YOUR CELL PHONES.

231
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:16,510
THE ONLY COMMUNICATION
IN THESE WOODS
IS WITH SHORTWAVE RADIOS.

SO, STAY CLOSE,
MAINTAIN VISUAL CONTACT.

233
00:18:18,895 --> 00:18:22,282
IF YOU GET LOST,
INITIATE ORAL CONTACT.
THAT MEANS HOLLER.

DON'T MOVE.  I WILL FIND YOU.

THAT THING LURED THAT WOMAN
OUT OF THE HOUSE...

243
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:57,351
TO SEPARATE HER
FROM HER SON.
FOR WHAT PURPOSE ?

244
00:18:57,351 --> 00:19:00,804

IF YOUR ENEMY HAS
GREATER NUMBERS THAN YOU...

245
00:19:00,804 --> 00:19:03,056
YOU DIVIDE AND CONQUER
TO DIMINISH THOSE NUMBERS.

WHEN I WENT TO CHECK
ON LOUIS AND HIS MOTHER.

A LITTLE STRANGE ?

258
00:20:10,172 --> 00:20:14,059
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.  PEOPLE GET
TO LOOKING AROUND, NEXT THING
THEY KNOW SOMETHING EATS THEM.

WHAT DO YOU THINK
KILLED THOSE MEN ?

260
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:19,181
NATURE IS POPULATED BY CREATURES
EITHER TRYING TO KILL SOMETHING
THEY NEED TO SURVIVE,

261
00:20:19,181 --> 00:20:23,185
OR TRYING TO AVOID BEING KILLED
BY SOMETHING THAT NEEDS THEM
TO SURVIVE.

THAT'S LATIN.
YEAH.  IT MEANS,
"INTO DARKNESS."

490
00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:37,949
THE SPANISH CONQUISTADORS
USED TO CARVE IT
ON THE POST...

491
00:40:38,449 --> 00:40:40,451
THAT THEY WOULD
LASH THE NATIVES TO
AS A WARNING.

492
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:42,753
SO, WHO ARE YOU SAYING
WROTE THIS ?

493
00:40:44,705 --> 00:40:48,709
PONCE de LEON CAME HERE
450 YEARS AGO LOOKING FOR
THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH.

494
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:51,612
YOU MEAN,
 YOU THINK THAT THAT BODY,

495
00:40:51,612 --> 00:40:55,616
THE ONE THAT
AGENT SCULLY SHOT--

496
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,335
NO.
AFTER 400 YEARS
IN THE WOODS,

497
00:40:57,835 --> 00:40:59,837
DON'T YOU THINK
THEY MIGHT HAVE ADAPTED
PERFECTLY TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT ?

498
00:40:59,837 --> 00:41:01,839
YOU'RE MAKING THIS UP.
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT ?

499
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:06,761
'CAUSE YOU WORK ON THE X-FILES
AND YOU JUST WANT TO WRITE OFF
YOUR MOTEL.

500
00:41:08,996 --> 00:41:12,800
SEARCH AND RESCUE
ARE STILL UNABLE
TO FIND JEFF GLASER...

501
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,635
OR THE SECOND PREDATOR
THAT YOU REPORTED.

502
00:41:14,635 --> 00:41:17,805
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF THEY COULDN'T FIND
EITHER ONE OF THEM.

503
00:41:17,805 --> 00:41:20,191
AGENT MULDER, I'M CONFUSED.

504
00:41:20,191 --> 00:41:22,944
WHY WOULD THEY COME AFTER
THE BOY IN THE HOUSE
THAT NIGHT ?

505
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:25,796
THESE PREDATORS
HAVE BEEN IN THESE WOODS
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

506
00:41:25,796 --> 00:41:28,299
THEY WOULD'VE PERCEIVED
ANY ENCROACHMENT ON
THEIR TERRITORY AS AN ENEMY,

507
00:41:28,799 --> 00:41:30,768
EVEN A LITTLE KID LIKE THAT.

508
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:33,771
BUT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THEY'D
COME AFTER ANY ONE OF US...

509
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:36,424
THAT HAD GONE INTO THE WOODS,
WOULDN'T IT ?

510
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:43,281
WHERE'S AGENT SCULLY ?

511
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:46,284
SHE GOT A LIFT BACK TO THE MOTEL
TO PACK UP BOTH YOUR THINGS.

512
00:41:46,284 --> 00:41:48,069
SHE DID ?
EXCUSE ME.

513
00:42:01,048 --> 00:42:03,934
MY JACKET'S IN THAT CAR.

514
00:42:57,254 --> 00:43:01,142
SCULLY !  SCULLY !

515
00:43:02,259 --> 00:43:04,612
MULDER, WHAT'S GOING ON ?

516
00:43:09,233 --> 00:43:12,737
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.
OKAY.

517
00:43:12,737 --> 00:43:15,740
YOU PACK EVERYTHING ?
YEAH.

518
00:44:27,495 --> 00:44:30,397
[ Child ]
I MADE THIS !
