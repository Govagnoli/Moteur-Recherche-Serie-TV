00:01:39,158 --> 00:01:41,285
Seven and Seven,

00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:46,526

5
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:50,801

6
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:53,235
Do you know me?

7
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:54,897
Come on, Wayno...

8
00:01:55,007 --> 00:01:57,703
I'm part of the regular game.

9
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,836
You know your problem, my friend?

10
00:02:00,947 --> 00:02:02,710
It's not the cards.

11
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:06,307
It's playing the hand you were dealt.

12
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:08,512
Plenty of guys get a bad deal.

13
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:10,953
It's all in what you do with it.

14
00:02:11,057 --> 00:02:14,288
You know what I'm saying, partner?

15
00:02:15,795 --> 00:02:17,922
You can think. Cards can't.

16
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,497
They just lie there.

17
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,362
You've got to
make them work for you.

18
00:02:22,468 --> 00:02:25,198
Jack of hearts.

19
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:35,044
2,598,960 possible...

20
00:02:35,147 --> 00:02:37,274
five-card hands.

21
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:40,409
1,277 flushes
in any given suit.

22
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:45,650
1,098,240 ways
to make two pairs...

23
00:02:45,758 --> 00:02:49,694
and yet...
the game can't beat a man.

24
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:53,492
Man only beats himself...

25
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,535
and so on and so forth.

26
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,203
She comes here every Friday...

27
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:10,806
and loses her paycheck...
cries all weekend.

28
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,440
Such a nice girl.

29
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:16,885
I keep hoping her luck
is going to change...

30
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,820
she'll catch a break.

31
00:03:25,464 --> 00:03:27,796
We going to blow this joint?

32
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,368
Call it a night?

33
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:31,993
Hey, Wayno.

34
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:35,302
You're bluffing me, right?

35
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:38,434
You're going to show me Fifth Street.

36
00:03:38,544 --> 00:03:42,947
Walk right out of here...
surprise me for a change.

37
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,573
Three of hearts...

38
00:04:11,677 --> 00:04:14,544
two of clubs.

44
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:33,593
Somebody help me! Oh, God.

45
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:37,226
She's been murdered.

46
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:30,644
Agent Reyes?

47
00:06:30,749 --> 00:06:34,082
Three plus four is seven.
Seven and six are 13.

48
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,177
What are you doing?

49
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:39,917
Ten, 13, 14, 16...

50
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,391
I want to ask you to open
your mind to something.

51
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:44,894
I don't want you to think
I'm crazy, all right?

52
00:06:44,997 --> 00:06:47,090
Why would I think
that you're crazy?

53
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,826
Do you believe the
universe is knowable...

54
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:52,495
as a mathematical calculation of the
whole reducible to a single equation?

55
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:54,766
- No.
- Why not?

56
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,068
Because I don't think
that its complexity...

57
00:06:57,176 --> 00:06:58,973
allows for it to be
reduced so simply.

58
00:06:59,078 --> 00:07:01,478
But you accept
that some people do?

59
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,708
I presume you mean the so-called
"Unified Theory?"

60
00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:08,275
What physicists often refer to
as the Theory of Everything?

61
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:12,483
An equation so simple they say that
it might be printed on a T-shirt.

62
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:15,151
It's a Holy Grail
in the world of science.

63
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:18,458
Potentially, the most
important question that
mankind has ever asked.

64
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:22,261
But that such a complex calculation
is even possible...

65
00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:25,769
is the subject
of enormous controversy.

66
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:28,999
Is that what you mean?

67
00:07:29,108 --> 00:07:31,804
Um... potentially.

68
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,383
Carla Maria Carpenter,
born 02-1-77.

69
00:07:39,485 --> 00:07:41,612
Killed outside
a nightclub two years ago.

70
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,187
Her murder remains unsolved.

71
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:50,884
Judy Ann Fuller...
born 03-21-69.

72
00:07:50,996 --> 00:07:54,022
Killed at a mall
two years ago. Unsolved.

73
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,200
Julie Frances Gresham...
born 01-22-80.

74
00:08:02,308 --> 00:08:05,004
Killed in her parked car last month.

75
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,202
Unsolved.

76
00:08:06,312 --> 00:08:08,974
Agent Reyes, if there's a connection...

77
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:12,812
that I'm supposed to be seeing,
I'm not seeing it.

78
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:14,408
And our latest victim...

79
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,853
Amy Sheridan Noffsberger...
born 04-4-77.

80
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,754
Killed two weeks ago in a casino.

81
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:23,350
Police have yet to find her killer.

82
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:25,430
Agent Reyes, am I to presume...

83
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:27,556
that you've solved
these unsolved murders...

84
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,861
by using some kind
of numerical calculation?

85
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:33,460
Letters of names assigned
values, added to birth dates...

86
00:08:33,572 --> 00:08:36,063
reduced to the lowest
common denominator.

87
00:08:36,175 --> 00:08:37,403
A, J, S, equal one.

88
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:38,407
B, K, T...

89
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,603
Numerology, Agent Reyes?

90
00:08:40,713 --> 00:08:43,648
You're trying to solve these cases...

91
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:47,617
by using what is essentially
a child's game.

92
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,779
It's been in use since
the sixth century B. C...

93
00:08:49,888 --> 00:08:51,617
when Pythagoras determined
that the world was built...

94
00:08:51,724 --> 00:08:53,123
on the power
and influence of numbers.

95
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:55,022
And, uh, when exactly...

96
00:08:55,127 --> 00:08:57,254
did you stumble upon it?

97
00:08:57,363 --> 00:09:01,322
We did it as kids.
I still do it.

98
00:09:01,433 --> 00:09:05,597
You meet people at a party
ask them their birth date.
It's kind of an icebreaker.

99
00:09:05,704 --> 00:09:09,538
And as I was reading
the story of this woman,
I calculated she was a 14...

100
00:09:09,641 --> 00:09:11,199
what they call
a karmic number...

101
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,005
an extremely significant
numerological number.

102
00:09:13,112 --> 00:09:15,740
Prompting me to look at all of
these other unsolved cases...

103
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:19,045
the victims of which
also work out to have
karmic numbers...

104
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:21,984
ten, thirteen, sixteen.

105
00:09:22,087 --> 00:09:25,955
So, in other words, you haven't
actually solved these cases.

106
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:28,891
Maybe "cracked"
is a better word.

107
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:31,360
Without any other evidence
to directly connect them...

108
00:09:31,463 --> 00:09:34,261
circumstantial or forensic.

109
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:38,800
What?

110
00:09:43,475 --> 00:09:45,534
Can you enlarge this?

111
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,920
Can I see the rest
of those photos?

112
00:09:58,023 --> 00:10:00,924
What is it?

113
00:10:01,026 --> 00:10:04,018
There's a pattern
in the bruising.

114
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:05,653
Yeah...

115
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:08,858
all four of the victims have it.

116
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:11,561
Three small circles.
They might be from a ring...

117
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,365
that the killer wears.

118
00:10:13,472 --> 00:10:17,602
So you're saying
these cases are connected.

119
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:20,542
That numerology may actually
be driving the killer...

120
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:21,977
and that I'm definitely
not crazy.

121
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,480
Or that maybe you're both crazy.

00:14:20,452 --> 00:14:22,044

one, or all three...

168

a numerological connection.

I give valuable
insights to the living.

170
00:14:37,536 --> 00:14:39,401
The dead pretty much
already know their future.

171
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:42,473
These are murders.
I'm looking for your help
in trying to solve them.

172

You may overestimate
the kind of work I'm capable of here.

173
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,868
My hope is in doing the victims'
complete numerology...

174
00:14:47,979 --> 00:14:50,539
you'll be able
to draw a picture of the killer.

00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:53,812
I don't think you understand.
I run a little business here.

to develop a profile...

199

on the man we are officially calling
the Triple Zero Killer.

200
00:16:18,303 --> 00:16:21,067
Through the identification
of a pattern he leaves on his victims...

201
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:22,765
we have been able to connect...

202
00:16:22,874 --> 00:16:24,899
six unsolved cases
to one murderer.

203
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,740

on the case forensics.

205
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,215
That's three recent killings
and three from 1999.

206
00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:34,148

now appears to be...

207
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:36,413
murders in threes
on a serpentine trail...

208
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:38,216
up across the Eastern Seaboard.

209
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:41,156
Agent Doggett will lead the task force
and is ready to roll.

210
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:44,126
Here's what we don't know.
One, how he chooses his victims.

211
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:46,697
Two, how the killer kills
and three, if he'll kill again soon...

212
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,629
or disappear as he did
two years ago.

213
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:51,099
He may have been incarcerated
during those years.

214
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:52,898
We may be looking
for someone with a record.

215
00:16:53,004 --> 00:16:54,835
That's an excellent observation.

216
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,134
The killer is strong.

217
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:58,607
He uses his fists as weapons.

218
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,678
Brute force.

219
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:03,009
He is angry, and he acts on impulse.

220
00:17:03,114 --> 00:17:04,809
Good. Important.

Well, the killer probably has...

224
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:16,323
a Soul Number of either four or six.

225
00:17:16,428 --> 00:17:18,020
His Birth Path is...

226
00:17:18,129 --> 00:17:20,359
I'm guessing, a nine,
or maybe a six.

230
00:17:27,372 --> 00:17:28,896

- Yes, sir.

find his way here?
Chance? Coincidence?

you came here to see her

00:18:37,943 --> 00:18:40,002
That's actually why I
came to see this woman...

254
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:41,442
to find out who the killer is...

255
00:18:41,546 --> 00:18:43,514
why he does what he
does when he does it.

256
00:18:43,615 --> 00:18:45,913
We have a reputation
to uphold, Agent Reyes.

257

consult horoscopes...

or palm readers or crystal balls.

260
00:18:52,524 --> 00:18:55,584
A killer kills for a reason.

261
00:18:55,694 --> 00:18:58,390
He lives in the world of cause
and effect, as we all do.

262
00:18:58,496 --> 00:19:00,987
He gets an impulse
and acts on it.

263
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,567
Always the case,
even if he doesn't know it...

264
00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:05,329
and <i>that's</i> how we catch him.

265
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:07,496
If he acts on impulses
he can't understand...

266
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:10,096
isn't it possible we can't
understand them either?

267
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,233
Can we not accept that
every killer is not...

268
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:14,835
driven by the same impulses
and that there are some impulses...

269
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,743
that not every killer kills for?

270
00:19:16,848 --> 00:19:18,679
No.

271
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:19,681
Why not?

272
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,684
Because it's unacceptable.

273
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,254
But if Agent Reyes didn't
tell anyone she was coming here...

274
00:19:24,356 --> 00:19:27,553
the only person who would
possibly have any idea
is somebody at the F.B.I.

275
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:29,456
An inside job? I don't buy it.

276
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:32,462
But don't we at least
have to accept that as a possibility?

277
00:19:32,564 --> 00:19:33,963
No, we don't.

278
00:19:34,065 --> 00:19:35,692
Why?

279
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,893
Because it's highly improbable.

280
00:19:38,003 --> 00:19:39,561
But not impossible.

281

a dozen of the other.

to proceed, sir?

All right, let's get
the body out of here.

287
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,920
Maybe you were followed.

288
00:19:57,022 --> 00:20:00,150
How? If the killer didn't even know
I was looking for him?

289
00:20:01,693 --> 00:20:03,456
I don't know...
you explain it then.

290
00:20:03,561 --> 00:20:07,190
This woman called me just
before she was murdered.

291
00:20:07,298 --> 00:20:10,267
She had something to tell me,
something she found in
the victims' charts.

292

in 13 different categories.

296
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:19,643
But a calculation based on what?

297
00:20:19,744 --> 00:20:21,143
On names and birth dates.

298
00:20:21,246 --> 00:20:23,646

is John Jay Doggett...

the victims' charts.

When the numbers were figured...

350
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:51,005
the numerologist found they were
a match to her own numbers.

00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,948
How did the killer find her?

352
00:24:54,052 --> 00:24:56,179
It obviously wasn't an accident.

353
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:00,515
And how does that help us
find the killer?

354
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,093
It doesn't.

357

I think we have a psychological profile
on the murderer.

00:25:28,186 --> 00:25:29,244
What is it?

359
00:25:29,354 --> 00:25:32,152
Based on the amalgam
of forensic detail of facts...

360
00:25:32,256 --> 00:25:35,851
such as time and place
the murders were committed
and the amount of force used...

361
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,724
we believe the killer is a man
in his mid-20s to late 40s...

362
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,264
of average build and looks
who is driven by rage...

363
00:25:41,366 --> 00:25:44,631
stemming from a hatred of his mother
from a very early age.

364
00:25:44,736 --> 00:25:46,966
He was a bed wetter
who was made to feel inferior...

365
00:25:47,071 --> 00:25:50,006
which he took out on the world
by killing small animals.

of almost every single serial killer...

371
00:25:59,784 --> 00:26:01,649
Is that really all that surprising?

372
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:07,282
Is there a problem, Agent Doggett?

373
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,526
It's the way Agent Reyes
found the cases.

374

so easily be dismissed.

forms a number six.

00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:33,107
Your point?

What if this is the killer's pattern?

383
00:26:46,164 --> 00:26:49,156
What if the number six...

384

to the murders?

00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:53,533
It may...

00:26:53,638 --> 00:26:57,972
to you and Agent Reyes,
but not to victim number seven.

these numbers...

I know we could
figure this out.

527
00:36:27,678 --> 00:36:29,236
You're a scientist, Agent Scully.

528
00:36:29,346 --> 00:36:30,813
Your world is ruled by numbers:

529
00:36:30,914 --> 00:36:33,348
- Atoms, molecules, periodicity.
- Wow!

530
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,748
And wouldn't it follow
that everything made
from those things...

531
00:36:35,853 --> 00:36:37,184
is ruled by numbers, too:

532
00:36:37,287 --> 00:36:39,152
Genes, chromosomes,
us, the universe.

533
00:36:39,256 --> 00:36:40,450
Go, girl.

534
00:36:40,557 --> 00:36:43,754
Agent Reyes,
that is utter nonsense, okay?

535
00:36:43,861 --> 00:36:47,661
It would mean that all we are
are checkers on a checkerboard...

536
00:36:47,765 --> 00:36:49,756
being moved around
by some forces...

537
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:52,427
completely outside
and unbeknownst to us.

538
00:36:52,536 --> 00:36:54,731
- What did Einstein say?
- Einstein... now there's a winner.

539
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,238
"God does not play dice
with the universe."

540
00:36:57,341 --> 00:37:00,833
Nor does he play checkers.

541
00:37:00,944 --> 00:37:04,846
Look, Agent Reyes,
you can't reduce all of life...

542
00:37:04,948 --> 00:37:07,576
all creation, every piece of art...

543
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,209
architecture, music, literature...

544
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,378
into a game of win or lose.

545
00:37:11,488 --> 00:37:12,978
Why not?

546
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,251
Maybe the winners are those
who play the game better.

547
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,953
Those who see the patterns
and connections...

548
00:37:18,062 --> 00:37:19,051
like we're doing right now.

549
00:37:19,163 --> 00:37:20,061
Free will.

550
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:24,857
Maybe we're not
the next victims.

551
00:37:24,968 --> 00:37:28,631
Maybe we're here
because we saw the numbers
and read the patterns...

552
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:30,798
and we're here
to catch the killer.

553
00:37:30,908 --> 00:37:33,570
But the killer is outside, killing...

554
00:37:33,677 --> 00:37:36,646
and we are stuck
in a parking garage.

555
00:37:36,747 --> 00:37:38,715
What if he's not?

556
00:37:40,484 --> 00:37:44,818
What if we didn't look
hard enough?

557
00:37:44,922 --> 00:37:47,982
What if the killer's
still down here?

558
00:37:53,664 --> 00:37:55,928
What are you looking at?

559
00:37:57,201 --> 00:37:59,726
The same thing you are.

560
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:04,473
So what now?

561
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:06,475
- You go left,
- I'll go right.

562
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:09,444

- Yeah, I think so.

Why'd you do it...
kill those women?

How did you ever find us?

571
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:42,995
I saw something in his pattern.

572
00:39:43,106 --> 00:39:45,472
It made me realize there's going
to be nine victims.

573
00:39:45,576 --> 00:39:48,067
Maybe you two were going to
be eight and nine.

Nine is completion. You've evolved
