Agent Scully ?
Detective Rempulski, Alexandria P.D.

10
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:39,915
Thanks for coming down
to do this.

11
00:00:51,498 --> 00:00:57,095
- It him ?
- Yeah.

12
00:01:10,384 --> 00:01:12,579
Agent Scully,
please have a seat.

13
00:01:17,624 --> 00:01:19,751
Agent Scully,
we've had a brief discussion,

14
00:01:19,826 --> 00:01:24,195
but will you restate the matter
we're here to put to rest ?

15
00:01:24,264 --> 00:01:26,198
Yes, sir.

16
00:01:28,735 --> 00:01:30,669
Four years ago,

17
00:01:30,737 --> 00:01:35,902
Section Chief Blevins assigned me to
a project you all know as the X-Files.

18
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:40,606
As I am a medical doctor
with a background in hard science,

19
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,616
my job was to provide
an analytical perspective...

20
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:47,949
on the work
of Special Agent Fox Mulder...

21
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:52,287
whose investigations
into the paranormal...

22
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:55,158
were fueled
by a personal belief...

23
00:01:55,228 --> 00:02:00,131
that his sister had been abducted
by aliens when he was 12.

24
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,364
I come here today,
four years later,

25
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:09,738
to report on the illegitimacy
of Agent Mulder's work.

26
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:15,081
It is my scientific opinion...

27
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:18,379
that he became,
over the course of these years,

28
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:20,919
a victim--

29
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:24,923
a victim
of his own false hopes...

30
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:27,255
and of his belief...

31
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:29,922
in the biggest of lies.

32
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:25,143
We're meeting the guide
at base camp.

33
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:27,448
- He'll take us to the site.
- Has he seen it ?

34
00:03:27,554 --> 00:03:31,149
Oh, yeah.
He said it's unbelievable.

35
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:09,626
- How soon can we get to the site ?
- Right now ?

36
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:12,164
We'd be pushing it
to be up top by nightfall.

37
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:15,258
I'd rather sleep seeing it than
lay awake all night wondering.

38
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:19,500
- It's gonna take some work.
- I've waited all my life for this day.

39
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:21,972
Let's do it.

40
00:05:06,686 --> 00:05:08,620
[Man]
Over here !

41
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:17,992
Hello.

42
00:05:18,064 --> 00:05:20,555
- I assume you're okay.
Nice to meet you.
- George.

43
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,146
My God.
It's beautiful.

44
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:44,083
[Blevins]Agent Scully,
I presume you have a basis...

45
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:46,091
for this break
from Agent Mulder.

46
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:50,389
Recent events
have shed new light...

47
00:05:52,532 --> 00:05:56,298
that would serve to prove
the existence of extraterrestrial life,

48
00:05:56,369 --> 00:06:00,396
which is the foundation
of Agent Mulder's consuming
devotion to his work.

49
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:02,236
What factual evidence ?

50
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:04,766
Agent Mulder was recently
contacted by a man...

51
00:06:04,844 --> 00:06:09,110
whose pursuit of this evidence
seemed to coincide with his own.

52
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:13,278
In his intense desire
to believe,

53
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,584
Agent Mulder was duped
by this man.

54
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,990
He was fooled by an act
of scientific sleight of hand...

55
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:26,294
calculated to perpetuate
false truths, the larger lie.

56
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:29,790
I am here today
to expose this lie,

57
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:32,429
to show the mechanism
of deception...

58
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:35,963
that drew him and me into it...

59
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:39,534
and to expose
Agent Mulder's work for what it is.

60
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:49,817
[Scully]Grabbing him by the knees,
then him falling backwards,

61
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:52,119
- tumbling over me and down the stairs.
-[Knocking]

62
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:55,161
- Hi.
- Speaking of Bill, is he coming ?

63
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:58,254
- Good evening. May I take your coat ?
- Thank you.

64
00:06:58,298 --> 00:07:00,266
There he is.

65
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:03,566
[ Laughing ]
Hi.

66
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:07,105
Hello, Dana.

67
00:07:07,173 --> 00:07:10,108
- Look at you.
- Look at you, my big brother.

68
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:12,940
I'm sorry I'm late.
My ship got stuck in traffic.

69
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:15,480
[ Chuckling ]

70
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:18,483
- Did you get my birthday card ?
- Yes, I did.

71
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:21,349
- Thanks for remembering this year.
- Once a decade.

72
00:07:27,227 --> 00:07:29,593
How you feeling, Dana ?

73
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:33,996
- I'm fine. Let's get some dinner, huh ?
- Yeah, I'm starving.

74
00:07:36,402 --> 00:07:38,063
You came just in time.

75
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:44,137
[Guests Chuckling]

76
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,976
[Bill] So the parrot says,
"I only got one question:

77
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:50,140
What did that chicken
in there do ?"

78
00:07:50,216 --> 00:07:53,242
[ Laughing ]

79
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:57,154
- Mom, I'll open some more wine.
- Okay.

80
00:08:03,997 --> 00:08:07,728
[ Sighs ] I feel awkward
sitting here. I'm sure you do too.

81
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:10,928
- No. I'm sorry.
- I've known your family
for so many years.

82
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:13,029
Your mother
asked me to come,

83
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:16,166
that I might have
a word with you.

84
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:18,904
I know it's been some time
since we've spoken ourselves,

85
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:22,243
since you drifted
from the church.

86
00:08:22,282 --> 00:08:24,910
- Father McCue--
- But at a time of personal crisis,

87
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:26,918
a threat to your health,

88
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:32,754
- turning back to your faith
is important and essential.
- Father McCue...

89
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:37,296
I appreciate my mother's
concern... and yours,

90
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:41,167
but I'm being treated for my cancer,
and I'm taking every precaution.

91
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:44,430
Faith can make you
stronger.

92
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:50,138
I haven't felt a need.

93
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,270
I have strength, and--

94
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:57,282
-[phone Rings]
- and I'm not going
to come running back now.

95
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,284
It’s just not who I am.

96
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:01,946
I'd be lying to myself
and to you.

Dana. phone.

98
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:10,563
Excuse me.

99
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,067
- No, is something the matter ?
- I need your help on something.

100
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:29,479
- Somebody named Arlinski just
contacted me at the Smithsonian.
- Contacted you about what ?

101
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:32,950
- About something he found
on a mountain in Canada.
- What ?

102
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:36,250
I'd rather not talk about it
over the phone. I just need you
to meet me at the Smithsonian.

103
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:38,415
- When ?
- Right away.

104
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:47,132
I'm on my way.

105
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:56,266
[ Mulder] I'm gonna have to apologize
to your brother and mother.

106
00:09:56,342 --> 00:09:58,810
- This is something that
just couldn't wait, though.
- It's okay.

107
00:09:58,912 --> 00:10:00,812
Who is this Arlinski ?

108
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:05,442
He's a forensics anthropologist
that I've been in contact with
over the past four years.

109
00:10:05,518 --> 00:10:09,147
Several years ago he was involved
in a U.F.O. photo enhancement scandal,

110
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:11,622
but he continues
to profess his innocence.

111
00:10:11,691 --> 00:10:14,159
- What am I coming to see ?
- I'm not going to tell you.

112
00:10:14,227 --> 00:10:16,161
I want you to decide
for yourself.

113
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:20,198
[Arlinski]
By my rough estimate,

114
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:22,427
from the sediment
in our ice core samples,

115
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:25,471
the body you're looking at
is over200years old.

116
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:28,166
- It looks perfectly intact.
-[Arlinski] Yeah.

117
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:30,300
That doesn't make sense. There would
have been signs of predation.

118
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:34,437
Yeah, but the position he was found in,
stuffed in a crevice at high altitude,

119
00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:37,711
he may have frozen
fast enough to avoid being eaten.

120
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:41,049
- Does that fit geologically ?
- The area where he was found...

121
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,089
is in the terminal moraine
of a glacier which has since receded.

122
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:48,491
Two hundred years ago,
the area where he was frozen
was within the tree line.

123
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:50,654
- There would have been a thaw.
- Who found him ?

124
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,496
A Canadian
geodetic survey team.

125
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:58,499
Along with a colleague
of mine named Babcock,

126
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:01,699
they're all still up there
on the mountain.

127
00:11:01,774 --> 00:11:04,538
- Who else knows about this ?
- No one.

128
00:11:05,878 --> 00:11:09,609
I know what
your first thought was,

129
00:11:09,682 --> 00:11:11,775
but the St. Elias range ?

130
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:14,046
That's a long way to go
for a hoax.

131
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,285
- If you’re gonna go,
why not go all the way ?
- I'm circumspect myself,

132
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:22,089
but the ice core samples
I took can't be faked.

133
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:24,186
You have the ice core
samples here ?

134
00:11:24,263 --> 00:11:26,288
Yeah.
Yeah.

135
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:33,032
One taken from each side
of the body.

136
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:37,304
A 360-degreematching
integrity of sediment.

137
00:11:38,878 --> 00:11:41,176
It's my sincere belief...

138
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:43,306
that what we have here...

139
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:47,080
is the complete corpus of
an extraterrestrial biological entity.

140
00:11:47,153 --> 00:11:49,644
Absolute,
and irrefutable.

141
00:11:49,722 --> 00:11:52,623
Qualitatively indefensible.
You go public with this,

142
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:55,058
and nobody is going
to believe you.

143
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:58,063
You also risk never knowing
because the same people who
buried the truth so assiduously...

144
00:11:58,131 --> 00:12:01,794
- will be in charge
of its authentication.
- That's why I came to you.

145
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:03,893
I need to get the specimen out
so I can authenticate it.

146
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:09,272
This body means everything
to you, Agent Mulder.

147
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:12,800
- You're gonna have
the proof in your hands.
- And what do you want ?

148
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,245
We just want the credit.

149
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:23,153
- Do you think it’s foolish ?
- I have no opinion, actually.

150
00:12:23,222 --> 00:12:25,884
- You have no opinion ?
- This is your Holy Grail,
Mulder, not mine.

151
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,892
What is that
supposed to mean ?

152
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:33,089
is not my last, dying wish.

153
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,601
How about Santa Claus
or the Easter Bunny ?

154
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,969
This is not some selfish
pet project of mine.

155
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:44,635
I'm as skeptical of that man
as you are, but definitive proof...

156
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,646
of sentient beings sharing
time and existence with us
would change everything.

157
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:50,807
Every truth we live by
would be shaken to the ground.

158
00:12:50,883 --> 00:12:54,580
There is no greater
revelation imaginable,
no greater scientific discovery.

159
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:57,316
You already believe, Mulder.
What difference will it make ?

160
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,449
What will proof change for you ?

161
00:13:01,194 --> 00:13:05,028
If someone could prove to you the
existence of God, would it change you ?

162
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:07,929
Only if it had been disproven.

163
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,197
Then you accept the possibility
that belief in God is a lie ?

164
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,602
I don't think about it,
actually,

165
00:13:13,673 --> 00:13:15,937
and I don't think
that it can be proven.

00:34:01,353 --> 00:34:04,618
But if this isn’t alien,
I don't know what it is.

333
00:34:04,689 --> 00:34:08,284
[Cell phone Ringing]

334
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,294
Mulder.

335
00:34:10,362 --> 00:34:12,455
[ Scully] I had reached
Agent Mulder in a warehouse...

336
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:15,795
just outside of Washington
in Sethburg, Virginia.

337
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:19,268
They had managed
the frozen corpse by helicopter...

338
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:21,271
down the side
of the mountain...

339
00:34:21,373 --> 00:34:25,776
and across the Canadian border
in a refrigerated truck.

340
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:29,473
After conducting a limited
physical examination,

341
00:34:29,547 --> 00:34:32,277
Agent Mulder
was ready to believe...

342
00:34:32,384 --> 00:34:37,788
that the body was that of an
extraterrestrial biological entity,

343
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:40,450
that he had finally found
the proof which had eluded him,

344
00:34:40,525 --> 00:34:44,655
which would confirm not only
the existence of alien life,

345
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:47,527
but of his sister
Samantha's abduction.

346
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,399
But this man Kritschgau had
convinced you otherwise. How ?

347
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:55,166
He told me a story,
which detailed point by point...

348
00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:00,337
the systematic way in which Agent
Mulder had been deceived and used,

349
00:35:00,445 --> 00:35:05,542
and how l, as his partner,
had been led down the same path,

350
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:09,280
losing a family member
due to my allegiance...

351
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,780
and contracting a fatal disease, which
I was being told was engineered...

352
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:17,919
by the men who are responsible
for Agent Mulder's deception.

353
00:35:17,996 --> 00:35:20,157
Were you able to convince
Agent Mulder of these facts ?

354
00:35:20,231 --> 00:35:22,961
I was only able
to convince him to meet me...

355
00:35:23,034 --> 00:35:26,265
so that he might
hear the story the way I had.

356
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:04,537
[Creaking]

357
00:36:06,978 --> 00:36:11,278
- Who the hell is this ?
- Right there, Pork.

358
00:36:14,052 --> 00:36:16,577
How's the wound ?

359
00:36:16,654 --> 00:36:18,588
I'll live.

360
00:36:20,225 --> 00:36:22,557
What is this,
Babcock ?

361
00:36:34,072 --> 00:36:36,836
[Gunshot]

362
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,278
Where did Mulder go ?

363
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:50,947
- He got a call.
- Is he a believer ?

364
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:53,422
Oh, yeah.

365
00:36:53,525 --> 00:36:56,926
- Then we're the only ones who know.
- Right.

366
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:02,290
The lie you believe--

367
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:07,134
that they have cleverly led you
to believe, Agent Mulder--

368
00:37:07,205 --> 00:37:10,732
is that there's intelligent
life other than our own...

369
00:37:10,808 --> 00:37:13,242
and that we have had contact
with these life-forms.

370
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:17,476
So you’re saying this
has all been orchestrated, a hoax ?

371
00:37:17,582 --> 00:37:21,678
- Which you have been
used to perpetuate.
- You come by this knowledge how ?

372
00:37:24,055 --> 00:37:26,990
Working for the D.O.D.

373
00:37:28,426 --> 00:37:30,986
Watching a military
industrial complex...

374
00:37:31,062 --> 00:37:34,088
that operated unbridled
and unchecked during the Cold War...

375
00:37:34,165 --> 00:37:38,727
create a diversion of attention from
itself and its continued misdeeds...

376
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:41,465
by confabulating enough
believable evidence...

377
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:47,034
to convince passionate adepts like
yourself that it really could be true.

378
00:37:47,111 --> 00:37:50,012
And just by chance,
you run into Agent Scully ?

379
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:55,182
[ Scoffs ]

380
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:57,483
I was just like you,
Agent Mulder:

381
00:37:57,589 --> 00:37:59,955
suspicious of everything
but what you should be.

382
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:06,125
I ran the D.O.D.'s
agitprop arm for a decade.

383
00:38:06,197 --> 00:38:08,290
I can show you records
of disinformation...

384
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:11,393
dating back to the Korean War,
before you were born.

385
00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:13,767
Why come to me now ?
Why not four years ago ?

386
00:38:16,341 --> 00:38:19,435
I have a son who's very sick.

387
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:22,070
He served in the Gulf War.

388
00:38:27,352 --> 00:38:29,820
The lies are so deep,

389
00:38:29,887 --> 00:38:32,048
the only way to cover them...

390
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:34,785
is to create something
even more incredible.

391
00:38:36,194 --> 00:38:38,355
They invented you:

392
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:42,297
your regression hypnosis,
the story of your sister's abduction,

393
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:44,301
the lies
they fed your father.

394
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:48,430
You wanted to believe so badly,
and who could have blamed you ?

395
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:50,667
And the thousands
of U.F.O. sightings ?

396
00:38:50,742 --> 00:38:53,836
Above-top-secret
military aircraft...

397
00:38:53,911 --> 00:38:56,379
concept designed
to feed hysteria.

398
00:38:56,447 --> 00:38:58,074
Evidence of alien biology ?

399
00:38:58,149 --> 00:39:02,085
Unclassified but naturally
occurring biologic anomalies...

400
00:39:02,153 --> 00:39:04,087
science will eventually explain.

401
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:06,555
- The body that was found ?
- Meticulously constructed...

402
00:39:06,658 --> 00:39:08,785
out of biomaterials...

403
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:12,956
created through the hybridization
of differentiated cells--

404
00:39:13,031 --> 00:39:14,965
what are called chimeras--

405
00:39:15,033 --> 00:39:17,092
frozen into place
over the course of a year...

406
00:39:17,168 --> 00:39:21,127
using sediment and materials
that would be a rout its age,

407
00:39:21,205 --> 00:39:24,572
poured through a small channel
drilled in the rock above.

408
00:39:24,676 --> 00:39:28,442
They would have known
the body would be carbon-dated,
that it would be proved a fake.

409
00:39:28,513 --> 00:39:31,812
- The body will never be tested.
- What do you mean ?

410
00:39:31,883 --> 00:39:34,147
You were only meant to see it...

411
00:39:34,218 --> 00:39:36,482
to make you believe the lie...

412
00:39:36,554 --> 00:39:39,421
so that you might
finally commit...

413
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,424
and go public with the news.

414
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:45,895
This man is a liar.

415
00:39:49,133 --> 00:39:51,465
You can see for yourself,
Agent Mulder.

416
00:39:51,536 --> 00:39:54,164
The body is already long gone.

417
00:40:11,756 --> 00:40:14,850
[Mulder]
Dr. Arlinski?

418
00:40:18,796 --> 00:40:20,764
It's gone.

419
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:25,235
Mulder ?

420
00:40:27,105 --> 00:40:29,266
- [Mulder Groans]
- What ?

421
00:40:30,441 --> 00:40:33,535
It's Arlinski.
He's dead.

422
00:40:37,482 --> 00:40:38,813
So is this man.

423
00:40:43,454 --> 00:40:47,083
Who did this, Mulder ?

424
00:40:47,158 --> 00:40:49,092
Mulder ?

425
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,754
What we had here was proof. There's
no way it could be anything else.

426
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:55,265
You said it yourself:
More tests needed to be run.

427
00:40:55,366 --> 00:40:57,300
But the ice core samples
checked out.

428
00:40:57,368 --> 00:41:00,166
If the ice hasn't been tampered with,
how could the body within be a fake ?

429
00:41:00,238 --> 00:41:02,502
Cellular material found
in the ice core samples...

430
00:41:02,573 --> 00:41:06,031
were a direct match for what
this man Kritschgau described:

431
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:09,045
hybrid cells, chimeras
within the matrix.

432
00:41:09,113 --> 00:41:11,911
Do we know for sure those cells
are not extraterrestrial ?

433
00:41:11,983 --> 00:41:15,419
Mulder, everything this man described--
You can’t just guess at these details.

434
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,616
I'm sorry, but the facts
here completely overwhelm
any argument against them.

435
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,557
Facts overwhelmed by the lies
created to support them.

436
00:41:22,627 --> 00:41:25,790
The only lie here is the one
that you continue to believe.

437
00:41:25,863 --> 00:41:29,230
After all I've seen
and experienced,

438
00:41:29,267 --> 00:41:32,100
I refuse to believe
that it's not true.

439
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:36,903
Because it's easier
to believe the lie, isn't it ?

440
00:41:36,974 --> 00:41:41,138
What the hell did that guy say to you
that you believe his story ?

441
00:41:43,614 --> 00:41:46,708
He said that the men
behind this hoax...

442
00:41:46,818 --> 00:41:49,378
behind these lies...

443
00:41:49,453 --> 00:41:53,321
gave me this disease
to make you believe.

444
00:42:08,673 --> 00:42:12,165
What we generally mean
is intelligent life,

445
00:42:12,276 --> 00:42:15,336
something resembling
our noble selves.

446
00:42:15,413 --> 00:42:17,881
It is highly probable...

447
00:42:17,949 --> 00:42:20,884
that there are such
intelligent forms of life...

448
00:42:20,952 --> 00:42:23,512
in other galaxies
in the universe,

449
00:42:23,588 --> 00:42:26,056
and it is even more probable...

450
00:42:26,123 --> 00:42:29,524
that many of these forms are
vastly more intelligent than we.

451
00:42:29,627 --> 00:42:32,790
I think there’s no question...

452
00:42:32,897 --> 00:42:36,333
but that we live
in an inhabited universe...

453
00:42:36,434 --> 00:42:39,801
that has life all over it.

454
00:42:39,904 --> 00:42:41,872
By finding out what the other
planets are like,

455
00:42:41,973 --> 00:42:47,172
by finding out whether there are
civilizations on planets of other stars,

456
00:42:47,245 --> 00:42:52,547
we reestablish meaningful
context for ourselves.

457
00:42:52,617 --> 00:42:56,917
[Montagu]I don't think we should
wait until the encounter occurs,

458
00:42:56,988 --> 00:43:01,584
but that we should do all in our power
to prepare ourselves for it.

459
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:06,824
I can conceive of no nightmare
as terrifying...

460
00:43:06,931 --> 00:43:10,128
as establishing
such communication...

461
00:43:10,201 --> 00:43:12,169
with so-called
superior...

462
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:15,831
or, if you wish, advanced
technology in outer space.

463
00:43:21,112 --> 00:43:25,344
Early this morning...
I got a call from the police,

464
00:43:25,416 --> 00:43:28,852
asking me to come
to Agent Mulder's apartment.

465
00:43:30,321 --> 00:43:33,051
The detective asked me--

466
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:38,495
He needed me to identify a body.

467
00:43:38,596 --> 00:43:41,565
Agent Scully--

468
00:43:50,441 --> 00:43:53,774
Agent Mulder died
late last night...

469
00:43:53,844 --> 00:43:58,076
from an apparent self-inflicted
gunshot wound to the head.
