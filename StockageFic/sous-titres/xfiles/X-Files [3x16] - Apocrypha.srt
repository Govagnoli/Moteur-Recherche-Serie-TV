- The suit was covered
in a thin film ofoil,

as was the French diverwhen I found him
lying delirious on his kitchen foor.

- What kind ofoil ?
- From the reports I'm getting,
it's the same substance...

201
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,271
that was found on the French diver's
wife when she was discovered...

202
00:17:12,342 --> 00:17:15,310
on the foor ofa Hong Kong
airport bathroom a few days ago.

203
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:17,946
According to the analysis,
it's 50-weight diesel oil, Scully.

According to the analysis,
it's 50-weight diesel oil, Scully.

205

That's thesame oil usedon World Warll
submarinesandon P-51 Mustangs.

206
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:26,954
- I don't understand.
- This oil is not only
50 years old, Scully,

207
00:17:27,022 --> 00:17:30,685
but its composition has been altered
by exposure to radiation.

208
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:34,752
I still don't understand.
How did this get onto the diver
and then onto the diver's wife ?

209
00:17:34,864 --> 00:17:37,890
I don't think this isjust ordinary
diesel oil, Scully. I think it's, uh--

210
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,365
I think it's a medium.

ofalien creature that uses it to...

- Krycek ?

219
00:18:06,395 --> 00:18:11,095

to Hong Kong under the control
ofthis thing to find Krycek--

- I know-- I know how it sounds.
- Is anybody not looking for Krycek ?

No, but I think the $64,000 question is,
