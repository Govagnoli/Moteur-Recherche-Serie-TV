1
00:00:09,623 --> 00:00:13,252
I remember me and him
all the way back to kindergarten.

2
00:00:13,327 --> 00:00:15,261
He was, uh--

3
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:21,691
I don't know.

4
00:00:21,768 --> 00:00:24,999
He was like a brother
or something.

5
00:00:26,073 --> 00:00:28,974
And we had some good times.

6
00:00:30,577 --> 00:00:35,480
Good times that I'll never
forget and junk like that.

7
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:41,351
And like now, we all got to
stick to get her and protect each other,

8
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:46,188
'cause that's what Bruno
would have wanted.

9
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,662
'Cause they say the cult is gonna
come try and get more of us, and...

10
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:52,926
we can’t let that happen.

11
00:00:56,803 --> 00:00:59,738
So we gotta kick some butt.

12
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:04,266
We gotta kick some butt,

13
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:09,345
Like I'm sure Bruno's
doing in heaven right now.

14
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:12,874
[Sobbing]

15
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:21,026
[Boy]
I really don’t know what to say.

16
00:01:21,094 --> 00:01:23,995
[Girl]
Here he is. Boom ?

17
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:30,903
- [Sobs]
- Boom ?

18
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:35,833
- You okay ?
- Yeah.

19
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:38,172
That was beautiful.

20
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:41,447
Yep.

21
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:48,282
So did you hear who the cult
is supposed to be coming after next ?

22
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:50,289
A blond virgin.

23
00:01:57,764 --> 00:02:00,927
Come on.
I'll give you guys a ride home.

24
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:09,900
Your mom is always saying, "Wait until
you're married. Don't give it away."

25
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,343
Yeah, and then some cult member
wants to kidnap you...

26
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:16,177
and sacrifice you
because you are a virgin.

27
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:21,585
God. I mean, how do they even know
if you really are a virgin ?

28
00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:24,749
I don't know.
I don't even want to think about it.

29
00:02:24,825 --> 00:02:27,658
You're not a virgin,
are you, Boom ?

30
00:02:27,727 --> 00:02:30,423
Uh, no.

31
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,999
You know, maybe if we weren't virgins,
we wouldn't be so scared.

32
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:12,261
- Over here !
- [Man]Hey! He found something.

33
00:03:17,477 --> 00:03:19,672
Oh, God.

34
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:22,612
- Is he dead ?
- Yeah, looks like he hung himself.

35
00:03:29,256 --> 00:03:34,125
- [Girl] He loves me.
- [Girl] He loves me not.

36
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:38,392
- He loves me.
- He loves me not.

37
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:43,528
- He loves me.
- He loves me not.

38
00:03:43,603 --> 00:03:49,098
- He loves me.
- He loves me not.

39
00:03:49,175 --> 00:03:51,200
He loves me.

40
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:55,215
- Not !
- [ Grunts ]

41
00:04:44,397 --> 00:04:47,730
[ Scully] The map says
to turn right at the intersection.

42
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:50,235
The detective who contacted me
told me to turn left.

43
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,464
- At the intersection ?
- At the stoplight.

44
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:54,563
This isn't a stoplight.
It's a stop sign.

45
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:56,642
I'm sure
she meant stop sign.

46
00:04:56,743 --> 00:04:58,677
Turn right.

47
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:21,356
What more can I say about the loss
of a young man like Jay De Boom...

48
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:26,770
that the sadness in each
of our own hearts does not
express more poignantly ?

49
00:05:26,873 --> 00:05:29,205
A few people have asked
if they might come up...

50
00:05:29,275 --> 00:05:32,244
and share some of their own
personal remembrances of Jay.

51
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:38,217
I’d like to invite them
to come forward at this time and
share some of those thoughts.

52
00:05:40,186 --> 00:05:42,848
His friends called him Boom.
Quarterback of the football team.

53
00:05:42,922 --> 00:05:45,482
He was well liked, a leader.
He was looking forward to college...

54
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:47,526
until he was found hanged
in the woods two days ago.

55
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:50,461
It's the third death of a high
school boy in as many months.

56
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,863
In your fax you said there were strong
suspicions of a satanic cult at work.

57
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:57,733
That's the popular opinion around here.
Wildly popular actually.

58
00:05:57,804 --> 00:05:59,203
Based on what evidence ?

59
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:02,536
Various eyewitness accounts
of satanic rituals being conducted.

60
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:06,305
I remember me and Boom
back to kindergarten.

61
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:10,577
He was-- I don't know--
Like a brother or something.

62
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,245
You have physical evidence
of these rituals being conducted ?

63
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,948
No. No, just
the murder victims.

64
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:21,357
So you have nothing concrete
to connect these things to satanists ?

65
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:26,661
If you detect a hint of skepticism
or incredulity in Agent Scully's voice,

66
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:29,463
it's because of the overwhelming
evidence gathered by the F.B.I....

67
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:32,869
debunking virtually all claims
of ritual abuse by satanic cults.

68
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:35,372
- Is that true ?
- [ Inhales ]

69
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:38,070
Don't ask me.

70
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:42,808
Our research has proven that most of
these accounts are false or imagined.

71
00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:47,751
The trauma or mental illness that is
often linked to satanic cults...

72
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:51,587
is the result of denial,
hysteria and misplaced blame.

73
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:54,718
You're going to have a hard time
convincing the locals of that,

74
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:57,957
especially after hearing the
stories of the two girls that
were there the night Boom died.

75
00:06:58,031 --> 00:06:59,965
- Who interviewed them ?
- I did.

76
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:03,935
- Together or separate ?
- Together. Why ?

77
00:07:04,003 --> 00:07:07,131
Then you have no way of
determining whether or not
their stories are fabricated.

78
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,698
No, no, these are good kids
we're talking about.

79
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,610
Outstanding students--and
the details they gave-- I doubt
they could have made them up.

80
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:19,015
Let me guess. They told you about a
wild beast entering in on a Black Mass,

81
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:22,851
the drinking of blood, the
sacrifice of an infant...

82
00:07:22,922 --> 00:07:25,413
or a blond virgin.

83
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:30,828
Yeah. That's right.
Excuse me.

84
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:33,593
[Man]
Let me in there !

85
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:39,002
- Where is she going ?
- You don't suppose
she's a virgin, do you ?

86
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:41,733
I doubt she's
even a blond.

87
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:43,672
[Man]
Would you let me by ?

88
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:45,210
You can't go in !

89
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:49,806
How long are we going to stand by
and watch our children die...

90
00:07:49,883 --> 00:07:53,216
while Satan's soldiers
run free in this city ?

91
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:55,686
- Bob, this is no time--
- No time ? No time ?

92
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:59,191
Hey ! Hey, hey, Bob !
This is not the place for this.

93
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:01,193
My wife can't sleep at night !

94
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:03,695
My kids say they can
feel Satan's presence !

95
00:08:03,763 --> 00:08:07,961
We got to wake up
and take action, people !

96
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:11,333
We got to cast the devil
out of our community!

97
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,873
[Screaming]

98
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:27,711
All right, everybody !
Stay calm !

99
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,559
Maybe we’re just
imagining that.

100
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:50,136
My name is Terri Roberts.

101
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:53,007
I go to Grover Cleveland
Alexander High School.

102
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:55,877
I'm a senior with
a 3.98 grade point average.

103
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:58,417
My name is Margi Kleinjan.

104
00:08:58,484 --> 00:09:01,351
I go to Grover Cleveland
Alexander High School.

105
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:05,357
I'm a senior with
a 3.75 grade point average.

106
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:08,622
I'm on the cheerleading yell squad
with my best friend Terri.

107
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:11,926
I'm on the cheerleading yell squad
with my best friend Margi.

108
00:09:11,998 --> 00:09:14,489
We plan to go to college
together in the fall.

109
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:19,300
Yeah. Could you tell me again
exactly what happened the night
of Jay De Boom's death ?

110
00:09:19,405 --> 00:09:21,600
Uh, Boom--

111
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:25,804
jay was giving us a ride home
in his truck...

112
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:29,040
when all of a sudden
he swerved off the road.

113
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:31,913
Like he had been possessed
or something.

114
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:35,853
He made us get out of the car
and walk to a clearing where...

115
00:09:35,922 --> 00:09:40,757
people were wearing black robes
and holding black candles.

116
00:09:40,827 --> 00:09:44,024
I couldn't see their faces
underneath their hoods,

117
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:46,224
but I knew they were
up to no good.

118
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:48,290
How did you know
they were up to no good ?

119
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:51,360
They were all standing
around this altar,

120
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:54,429
and one of them
had a long knife...

121
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:59,568
with a snake's head on
the handle with ruby eyes.

122
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:04,013
I thought we were dead because
we'd heard they were going
to sacrifice a blond virgin.

123
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:08,543
But instead they just brought
out this little crying baby...

124
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:10,816
and put it on the altar.

125
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,189
The man with the knife started
saying some kind of prayer.

126
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,491
He was chanting,

127
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:21,260
and he was saying stuff about how
they were going to sacrifice the baby,

128
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:25,031
because it hadn't
been christened yet...

129
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:29,905
and how they were going to bury it in
a mass grave on the outskirts of town...

130
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:31,878
with all the other babies
that they'd killed.

131
00:10:31,878 --> 00:10:32,776
with all the other babies
that they'd killed.

132
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,645
And-- And--

133
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:41,210
[ Margi ] The whole group
was chanting and saying things.

134
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:46,953
The man with the knife
raised the knife up over the baby,

135
00:10:47,026 --> 00:10:51,486
and that's when Terri and I
just ran for our lives.

136
00:10:51,564 --> 00:10:55,591
The two stories are virtually identical.
The one corroborates the other.

137
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:58,899
I don't suppose there have been
any actual reports of stolen infants...

138
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:02,169
or of mass graves being uncovered
anywhere in town...

139
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:06,769
or that you found an altar
or any other evidence of a Black Mass ?

140
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,404
No. No, in fact, we haven't.

141
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:11,710
The problem is that the details
of these accounts...

142
00:11:11,784 --> 00:11:14,651
could have been taken from
any news paper or magazine.

143
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:19,852
As horrific as they sound
the stories that these girls
told are common, even cliché.

144
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:23,054
If you detect a hint of impatience
in Agent Scully's voice,

145
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:26,030
that's because the F.B.I.'s study
also found that in most cases,

146
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:28,033
Like the McMartin
preschool trial,

147
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:32,299
witnesses were prompted in their
statements by rumors or stories
that were being circulated,

148
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:34,306
and there was nothing
to support them.

149
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:38,811
-How do you explain the burning coffin ?
-Don't ask me.

150
00:11:38,878 --> 00:11:40,971
[Woman Sighs]

151
00:11:50,323 --> 00:11:54,453
There have been incidents
where the embalming fluid
used to preserve the body...

152
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:57,621
have caused chemical reactions
and produced heat and burning.

153
00:11:57,697 --> 00:12:00,894
I see nothing here that
would suggest otherwise.

154
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:02,901
What is that ?

155
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:06,564
- [Scully] What's what ?
- That pattern on his chest.

156
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,702
Yeah, I see it. It looks like a... goat.
Some kind of horned beast.

157
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:13,836
- A horned beast ?
- Yeah. Right here...

158
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:16,073
in a circle.

159
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:18,742
I think you guys are seeing something
that isn’t there.

160
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:22,582
No, no, right here. Look.
You see that the horns are right there.

161
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,590
No, I don't see
the horns right there.

162
00:12:27,427 --> 00:12:31,761
I assume you'll call me
if you need me for anything further.

163
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:34,664
If it’s no bother--
If it’s not too big a deal,

164
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:37,134
maybe you can get me a few
photographs of that thing...
