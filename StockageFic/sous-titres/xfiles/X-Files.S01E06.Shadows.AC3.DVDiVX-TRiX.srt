You okay?

551
00:39:35,553 --> 00:39:38,215
lt will most likely be
in Dorlund's office.

552
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:41,918
We'll execute the search,
but we'll need you to guide us

to be strong, okay?

Ma'am, could you back away
from those files, please?

00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,774
This is all we could find.

558
00:40:40,885 --> 00:40:41,874
We don't have him.

559
00:40:41,986 --> 00:40:43,851
He's not even
breaking a sweat.

Our case is blown.

561
00:40:46,057 --> 00:40:47,922
We've wasted a year.

This guy's going to walk.

She's no agent.

l've been more than cooperative.

She has no right

569
00:41:18,122 --> 00:41:20,784
to destroy
my personal property.

570
00:41:20,858 --> 00:41:24,692
What about that van that blew up
and killed those servicemen?

571
00:41:24,762 --> 00:41:26,730
l don't know
whatyou're talking about

Oh, my god.

00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:47,138
Mulder: l guess what we're
looking for is here.

580
00:42:53,718 --> 00:42:55,549
The U.S. Attorney's Office

581
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:59,215
is going after Dorlund
with everything they've got

582
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:01,918
including the murder
of Howard Graves.

583
00:43:01,993 --> 00:43:03,824

Boy, she's in a rush
to get out ofhere.

589
00:43:25,116 --> 00:43:28,882
Out ofhere, or away from
the ghost of Howard Graves?

590
00:43:31,155 --> 00:43:33,715
Hey, Scully, doyou believe
in an afterlife?

591
00:43:33,791 --> 00:43:37,056
l'd settle for a life
in this one.

592
00:43:37,128 --> 00:43:39,460
You ever seen
the Liberty Bell?

593
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:40,929
Yes.

594
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:44,464
l've been to Philadelphia
1 00 times

595
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:45,866
and l've never seen it.

596
00:43:45,937 --> 00:43:47,199
You're not missing much.

597
00:43:47,271 --> 00:43:49,000
lt's a big bell
with a big crack

598
00:43:49,073 --> 00:43:51,041
and you have to wait
in a long line.

l know. l'm sorry.

Maybe that's the way
theywork back East

606
00:44:20,371 --> 00:44:23,636
but here in the Midwest,
punctuality is a virtue.

607

We really have to find
a new office space.

608
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:33,974
Every time a truck goes by

609
00:44:34,085 --> 00:44:36,553
the whole building shakes.

That's all, Lauren.
