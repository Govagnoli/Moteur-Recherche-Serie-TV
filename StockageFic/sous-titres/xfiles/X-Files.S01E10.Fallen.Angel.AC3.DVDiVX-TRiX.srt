1
00:00:18,365 --> 00:00:20,595
We got a fire
offcounty road D-7

2
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:22,931
two miles west of
the Canyon Ridge intersection.

3
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:25,801
Suggest we dispatch
fire crews. Over.

4
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:27,635
(static)

5
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,266
This is DeputyWright.

6
00:00:29,343 --> 00:00:30,867
Doyou copy?

7
00:00:32,612 --> 00:00:34,375
Son ofa...

8
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:53,994
Sir?

9
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:55,796
Sorry to disturbyou, sir

10
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:58,838
but we've picked up
an unidentified bogey.

11
00:00:58,905 --> 00:01:02,306
l thinkyou should see
the replay foryourself.

12
00:01:13,687 --> 00:01:14,984
lt tripped the fence
at 231 7

13
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:16,613
offConnecticut's coast.

14
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,555
lnitial trajectory,
north by northwest.

15
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:19,956
then it went crazy.

16
00:01:20,026 --> 00:01:22,153
Any other aircraft in the area?

17
00:01:22,262 --> 00:01:24,787
No known aircraft
can maneuver like this.

18
00:01:24,898 --> 00:01:26,798
Well,
whatever it was

19
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:29,836
dropped offthe screen
at 241 8, sir.

20
00:01:29,903 --> 00:01:31,837
Hit ground west
of Lake Michigan

21
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:33,600
outside
Townsend, Wisconsin.

22
00:01:33,673 --> 00:01:35,573
The tracking
prediction team

23
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:37,542
calculated impact
at over 800

24
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:38,908
miles per hour.

25
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:41,174
l've instructed Chief Koretz

26
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:42,215
to start
her report...

27
00:01:42,282 --> 00:01:43,214
Negative.

28
00:01:43,283 --> 00:01:44,875
She tracked
a meteor.

29
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:46,578
lt's aberrant movement

30
00:01:46,653 --> 00:01:49,247
was due
to instrument malfunction.

31
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:50,346
But, sir...

32
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:53,154
Your report
will refect these facts.

33
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:54,284
ls that clear?

34
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:55,292
Yes, sir.

35
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:57,090
Good.

36
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:08,937
Code lndigo-Delta-Echo-Niner.

37
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:12,376
l have a confirmed fallen angel
in sector 87.

38
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:16,075
Mobilize Operation Falcon
immediately.

39
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,191
Wright:
Hello?

40
00:02:48,248 --> 00:02:51,376
(screaming)

41
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,635
Reporter:
Theywill have no comment

42
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,040
until the government
investigation now underway

43
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:52,578
is completed.

44
00:03:52,646 --> 00:03:54,375
Government officials
remain vague

45
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:58,474
about the toxic cargo that has
caused the immediate evacuation

46
00:03:58,552 --> 00:04:01,544
ofTownsend, Wisconsin's,
1 2,000 residents.

47
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:03,748
Speculation here
has centered on

48
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:05,916
a shipment oftoxic waste.

49
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:08,517
Mulder:
Then what happened out there
if wasn't a train wreck?

50
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:11,563
Man:
Mr. Mulder, the continental
United States is surrounded

51
00:04:11,665 --> 00:04:16,932
by an electronic fence
that reaches 1 5,000 miles

52
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:18,436
into space.

53
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:20,405
We use it
to track and monitor

54
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:25,501
the 7,087 man-made objects
that orbit the earth.

55
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:29,709
Last night at 231 7
that fence was breached.

56
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:31,717
This morning at 01 00

57
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:34,413
Operation Falcon
went into effect

58
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:37,251
led by Colonel Calvin Henderson

59
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:39,815
the Air Force's
reclamations expert.

60
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:41,393
Reclamations?

61
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:43,257
During the Cold War,
hisjob

62
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,731
was to prevent technologies
from downed U.S. aircraft

63
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,767
from getting
into Soviet hands.

64
00:04:48,835 --> 00:04:51,633
He's part
ofa crash retrieval unit.

65
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:53,605
Mm-hmm.

66
00:04:53,673 --> 00:04:56,141
Quick response.

67
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:59,576
l'd sayyou have
24 hours

68
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:02,342
before the entire area
is sanitized.

69
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:06,545
After that, it would be
like nothing ever happened.

70
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:46,357
Man:
Alright, get the trucks rolling.

71
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:49,354
Man:
Keep 'emgoing!

72
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:59,562
(chattering)

73
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:13,545
(soldiers chattering)

74
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,613
(helicopter whirring)

75
00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:19,858
Thankyou, sir.

76
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:21,154
Thankyou.

77
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:23,752
Get 'er rolling.
Let's go! Let's go!

78
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:34,737
Soldier:
Alright, clear the road!

79
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:44,813
You're late, lieutenant.

80
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:46,681
lt will be dark
in a halfhour.

81
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:48,220
We had a fat, sir.

82
00:06:48,288 --> 00:06:50,415
There's a briefing
at 2200 hours.

83
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,685
Go to headquarters
for live rounds.

84
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:53,884
Live rounds, sir?

85
00:06:53,993 --> 00:06:55,620
You got a problem
with that?

86
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:57,594
We were told
this was a drill.

87
00:06:57,664 --> 00:06:59,222
They told you wrong.

88
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:01,061
Sir.

89
00:07:02,302 --> 00:07:03,530
Okay, everyone out!

90
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:05,730
Come on, people,
light a fire!

91
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:15,097
(indistinctchattering)

92
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:24,141
Man: Uh, roger,
this is Charley-Delta-SevenSquad.

93
00:08:24,217 --> 00:08:26,742
We're continuing thesearch,
butat this time, it'snegative.

94
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:35,561
(men yelling)

95
00:08:41,968 --> 00:08:46,803
(whooshing noises)

96
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:13,454
(shutter clicking)

97
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:42,087
(shutter clicking rapidly)

98
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:51,294
Youjust made
the worst mistake

99
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:53,702
ofyour life,
Agent Mulder.

100
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:57,740
l thinkyou knocked out
a filling.

101
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,368
You'll pay the price

102
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:01,470
for putting my men
at risk.

103
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:05,108
Since when does taking pictures
put lives at risk?

104
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:07,652
You violated
a U.S. Government quarantine

105
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,415
and that's a federal crime.

106
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:10,649
A quarantine?

107
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:12,156
That's whatyou call this?

108
00:10:12,225 --> 00:10:15,854
We're trying to contain
an ecological disaster.

109
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:18,989
That's a lot offirepower
to protect Mother Nature.

110
00:10:19,098 --> 00:10:20,497
l have my orders

111
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,798
and the license to execute them
as l see fit.

112
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:27,304
l suggest
you forget whatyou saw

113
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:30,536
orwhatyou thinkyou saw

114
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,544
foryour own well-being.

115
00:10:32,612 --> 00:10:35,740
You've got a downed craft
in those woods, sir

116
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:38,079
and troops
carrying live rounds.

117
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:40,381
We both know what's out there!

118
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:02,439
Areyou MUFON or KUFOS?

119
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:10,142
Doyou mind ifl sit down?

120
00:11:10,216 --> 00:11:11,376
Let me guess.

121
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:14,682
You're wh that new group,
CSlCOP, right?

122
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:19,284
Say no more.
You're a cautious man.

123
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:21,224
Trust no one-- verywise.

124
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:25,424
Afterwhat happened toJ.F.K.,
l understand completely.

125
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:27,489
Let me
introduce myself.

126
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:29,057
My name is Max Fenig.

127
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:32,467
l'm with the National
lnvestigative Committee

128
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:34,733
ofAerial Phenomenon--
NlCAP.

129
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,607
Pleased... pleased
to makeyour acquaintance.

130
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,410
l wish we could shake on it,
you know.

131
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:45,917
Firm grip,
look right in the eye--

132
00:11:45,985 --> 00:11:48,852
you learn a lot
about a guy that way.

133
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:52,523
Can l, um..?

134
00:11:52,592 --> 00:11:54,822
Can l askyou a question?

135
00:11:54,894 --> 00:11:57,362
Go ahead.

136
00:11:57,397 --> 00:11:58,887
Did you
see anything?

137
00:11:58,965 --> 00:12:00,023
Did you get close?

138
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:01,259
Me, l saw nothing.

139
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:02,800
l didn't see anything!

140
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:03,927
Nada, zip.

141
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:06,130
A hundred yards
past the roadblock

142
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,206
they nailed me.

143
00:12:07,306 --> 00:12:09,171
l have no idea
how they did it.

144
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:10,834
l'm telling you

145
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,606
it's like the Roswell cover-up
all over again.

146
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,308
What makes you so sure
there's something out there?

147
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:23,552
Same thing
that makes you so sure?

148
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:56,548
l didn't order room service.

149
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:58,487
This isn't funny,
Mulder.

150
00:12:58,558 --> 00:12:59,684
Did you meet Max?

151
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,124
Who?

152
00:13:01,194 --> 00:13:02,786
Max from NlCAP.

153
00:13:02,862 --> 00:13:05,194
Oh. They must have released him.

154
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:09,223
Another intrepid soul
in search ofa close encounter.

155
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:10,963
ls that what this is about?

156
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,594
What else?

157
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:15,640
Try explaining that
to Section Chief McGrath.

158
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,539
He's ordering
a full inquiry

159
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,168
with a recommendation...

160
00:13:19,245 --> 00:13:22,874
Mulder, he wants to shut down
the X-Files

161
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:24,746
and he wants you
out ofthe Bureau.

162
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:27,081
What else is new?

163
00:13:27,153 --> 00:13:29,485
l don't understand you, Mulder--

164
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:31,955
whyyou're always
defying protocol

165
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:33,514
ignoringjurisdiction.

166
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:35,925
Because l know
what l saw, Scully.

167
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:37,963
There weren't train tracks
anywhere near that site.

168
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,691
So how could it have been
a derailed container?

169
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,391
Because it wasn't.

170
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:43,969
Whatyou saw
was not a toxic spill.

171
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:46,834
But it wasn't
a U.F.O., either.

172
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:51,270
Okay, l'm all ears.
what was it?

173
00:13:51,344 --> 00:13:54,939
lt was a downed Libyanjet
with a nuclearwarhead.

174
00:13:55,014 --> 00:13:56,948
(chuckling)

175
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:59,280
Over U.S. airspace?

176
00:13:59,352 --> 00:14:01,411
They've been
picking up radiation

177
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:03,785
indicating
that the plutonium casing

178
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:04,948
may have cracked.

179
00:14:05,024 --> 00:14:06,616
So to avoid mass panic...

180
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:08,660
You really believe that story?

181
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:10,821
That story happens to be
highly classified.

182
00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:12,592
A highly classified lie.

183
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:15,691
(helicopterwhirring)

184
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:17,735
They're searching
for someone, Scully.

185
00:14:17,803 --> 00:14:20,237
Probably the pilot.

186
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:23,241
You think they'd roll out
all this material

187
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:25,402
for one Libyan fighterjock?

188
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:29,948
Besides, no human pilot
walked away from that wreckage.

189
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,710
Well, maybe he ejected.

190
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:36,379
Maybe.

191
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:22,561
Scully:
You can't be serious.

192
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:25,502
As long as we're here
in Townsend, why not?

193
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:27,436
The hearing
is tomorrow morning.

194
00:15:27,506 --> 00:15:29,906
That gives us 24 hours
to investigate.

195
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:32,001
My assignment
is to bring you back--

196
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:34,046
not to helpyou
dig yourselfin deeper.

197
00:15:34,113 --> 00:15:36,081
The LastDetail
starring Dana Scully.

198
00:15:36,382 --> 00:15:40,876
(phone offthe hook)

199
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:47,223
What's going on?

200
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:49,954
Looks like housekeeping
hasn't been hereyet.

201
00:15:50,062 --> 00:15:50,994
Who would..?

202
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:52,155
(banging)

203
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:54,062
Shh.

204
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:55,532
(banging)

205
00:16:17,456 --> 00:16:18,787
Max?

206
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:22,890
Getyour hands up!

207
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:24,860
Whoa, don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

208
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,397
Max?

209
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:28,524
Ahem.

210
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:33,503
My apologies.

211
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:34,504
Forgive me.

212
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:35,801
l'm a curious man.

213
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,137
l had to know.

214
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:38,073
Know what?

215
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:39,543
lfit was reallyyou.

216
00:16:39,612 --> 00:16:40,806
You don't know me.

217
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,745
Wejust met last night.

218
00:16:42,815 --> 00:16:46,342
We at NlCAP have been
following your career closely

219
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:48,250
sinceyour involvement
with X-Files.

220
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:50,289
Following my career? How?

221
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:52,586
The Freedom oflnformation Act.

222
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:54,592
Your travel expenses

223
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,321
are a matter
ofpublic record.

224
00:16:56,429 --> 00:17:00,263
So this must be
the enigmatic Agent Scully.

225
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:03,761
How did you
recognize me?

226
00:17:03,836 --> 00:17:06,669
l sawyour picture
in a trade publication once

227
00:17:06,739 --> 00:17:09,708
and l read your article in Omni
about the Gulf Breeze Sightings.

228
00:17:10,843 --> 00:17:13,710
l published that
under a pseudonym.

229
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:15,406
M.F. Luder. l know.

230
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:17,608
lt's an anagram for F. Mulder.

231
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:21,414
You really didn't think
that would fool us, did you?

232
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:24,513
l didn't think anybody
was paying attention.

233
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,684
Somebody is always
paying attention, Mr. Mulder.

234
00:17:27,793 --> 00:17:29,988
Amazing.

235
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:31,358
Amazing? Hardly.

236
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,228
You want to see
something amazing

237
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,767
come with me.

238
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:41,696
Enigmatic Dr. Scully.

239
00:17:52,818 --> 00:17:54,683
This is my, uh...

240
00:17:54,754 --> 00:17:56,585
Right this way.

241
00:17:56,655 --> 00:17:58,213
Excuse the mess.

242
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,917
Okay.

243
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:02,323
Where's those, uh...

244
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:07,693
Let me turn this off.

245
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:09,064
Theywere right here.

246
00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:12,866
Oh, here they are.

247
00:18:12,938 --> 00:18:16,772
The latest crop circle photos
from Project Argus. Huh?

248
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:18,537
Your opinion--
fact or fraud?

249
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:19,942
Mulder:
Fraud.

250
00:18:20,012 --> 00:18:23,971
Max:
Explain the anomalous blisters
on the plants.

251
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:26,574
Mulder:
Some unreported weathering
effect common to wheat

252
00:18:26,652 --> 00:18:28,745
or a systematic reaction
by the plant tissue

253
00:18:28,821 --> 00:18:30,015
to being lodged
in one position.

254
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:31,522
Max:
You've read the literature.

255
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,888
Mulder:
l try to keep up.

256
00:18:33,993 --> 00:18:36,291
You said you had
something to show us.

257
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:38,761
Oh, yeah.
The Wolfs Ear 2000.

258
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:40,059
Ever hear ofthis?

259
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:41,828
Yeah. Wolfindustries
supplies the C.l.A.

260
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:43,425
with all ofits
surveillance equipment.

261
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:44,901
State-of-the-art
search and intercept--

262
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,404
up to 1 00 channels
per second.

263
00:18:47,473 --> 00:18:49,805
l'm jacked into local
fire and police departments

264
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,570
cellular phone pathways

265
00:18:51,644 --> 00:18:53,043
and when the weather's right

266
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:56,138
air traffic control
from Whitmarsh air force base.

267
00:18:56,215 --> 00:18:57,648
What haveyou got, Max?

268
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:02,251
Mobile unit broadcast
in scan mode

269
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:05,381
Townsend Sheriffs Department
two nights ago.

270
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,653
We got a fire
offcounty road D-7

271
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,920
two miles west

272
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:11,155
ofthe Canyon Ridge
intersection.

273
00:19:11,263 --> 00:19:13,754
Suggest we dispatch
fire crews. Over.

274
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:15,333
This is DeputyWright.

275
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:16,526
Doyou copy?

276
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:18,934
And then this, 35 minutes later

277
00:19:19,004 --> 00:19:21,302
presumably from the fire crew.

278
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:24,103
Reception got wiggy
for some reason.

279
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:25,575
This is Unit 53.

280
00:19:25,644 --> 00:19:28,044
Man down. Request medevac.

281
00:19:28,113 --> 00:19:31,344
l said request medevac.

282
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:34,978
You're breaking up.
Barely... bad...

283
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:37,579
Very bad. Wait a second.

284
00:19:37,656 --> 00:19:38,588
What the hell?

285
00:19:38,657 --> 00:19:40,750
Charlie, we got
a situation here.

286
00:19:44,463 --> 00:19:46,294
We put up a tight net.

287
00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:48,333
Yes, sir, every inch
ofground is being covered

288
00:19:48,434 --> 00:19:50,231
dug up, squeezed, and sifted.

289
00:19:50,302 --> 00:19:53,100
No, sir.
lt will not get away.

290
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:54,799
Not this time.

291
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:17,928
Mrs. Wright?

292
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:20,559
Hi. l'm Fox Mulder.

293
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:21,861
This is Dana Scully.

294
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:23,128
We're from the F.B.l.

295
00:20:23,202 --> 00:20:25,636
We'd like to askyou
aboutyour husband.

296
00:20:25,704 --> 00:20:26,898
He's dead.

297
00:20:26,972 --> 00:20:29,202
What else is there
to know?

298
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:36,109
l'm sorry
aboutyour husband.

299
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:37,273
Oh, please.

300
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:39,180
Mrs. Wright,
we want to helpyou.

301
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:40,980
Then leave me alone.

302
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:42,247
Let us helpyou.

303
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:44,346
l don't know anything.

304
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,121
Don'tyou understand?

305
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:55,962
Theywon't even release the body

306
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:58,265
so l can give him
a proper burial, okay?

307
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:02,535
The government
can't do that.

308
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:04,439
l'm sure
ifwe appealed...

309
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,035
No! You can't.

310
00:21:07,112 --> 00:21:09,012
You're entitled
to the truth.

311
00:21:09,081 --> 00:21:11,709
l can't afford the truth.

312
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:13,684
They said ifl
spoke to anyone

313
00:21:13,752 --> 00:21:17,745
theywould withhold
my husband's pension

314
00:21:17,823 --> 00:21:21,122
and l have a child
to take care of.

315
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:28,128
(static screeching)

316
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,397
Picking up extremely high
frequency signal--

317
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,937
200,000 megahertz.

318
00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:34,905
Sir, target

319
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:36,601
on the northeast side.

320
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:37,699
foot speed--

321
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:39,539
seven miles per hour, sir.

322
00:21:39,612 --> 00:21:40,579
Beta team...

323
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:41,840
Copy.

324
00:21:41,914 --> 00:21:44,212
Target entering your section
from the southwest.

325
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:45,648
Search and destroy.

326
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:48,118
Repeat-- search and destroy.

327
00:21:48,187 --> 00:21:49,552
Yes, sir.

328
00:22:40,005 --> 00:22:41,267
jackson?

329
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,035
Nothing.

330
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:02,324
Must have been an animal.

331
00:23:19,378 --> 00:23:21,812
l'm sorry, but unless
you have a subpoena

332
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,041
l can't discuss
patient information.

333
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:26,811
Does that meanJason Wright
was your patient?

334
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:29,649
lt means l have
nothing more to say.

335
00:23:29,722 --> 00:23:32,054
What about to his wife
and child, Doctor?

336
00:23:32,124 --> 00:23:34,354
Would you have anything
to say to them?

337
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:36,826
Because whoever got toyou
also got to her.

338
00:23:36,895 --> 00:23:39,420
They must have made
some pretty big threats.

339
00:23:39,498 --> 00:23:41,363
What did they hold
overyour head--

340
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:43,162
your medical license,
the l.R.S.?

341
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:44,395
l hate fascists.

342
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,664
Excuse me?

343
00:23:45,738 --> 00:23:47,569
The men who came in here--

344
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:50,972
The way they
pushed us all around.

345
00:23:55,347 --> 00:23:57,542
Dr. Oppenheim, tell us
about the deputy.

346
00:23:57,649 --> 00:23:59,241
You saw him that night

347
00:23:59,351 --> 00:24:01,182
didn'tyou?

348
00:24:01,253 --> 00:24:02,220
Yes.

349
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:04,152
And three others
from a fire crew.

350
00:24:04,223 --> 00:24:07,283
Theywere all D.O.A. with
fifth- and sixth-degree burns

351
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:09,190
over 90% oftheir bodies.

352
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:11,752
But theyweren't like
any burns l've ever seen.

353
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,058
They took the bodies away

354
00:24:13,132 --> 00:24:15,430
before we could perform
any pathology.

355
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:18,698
Did you note any cadaveric
heat rigor or stiffening?

356
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:20,602
Quite a bit offexion
in the limbs.

357
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:22,299
How doyou know
so much about it?

358
00:24:22,374 --> 00:24:25,673
l did my residency
in forensic medicine.

359
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:27,143
ln your opinion

360
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:30,670
could those burns have been
caused by ionizing radiation?

361
00:24:30,783 --> 00:24:32,751
Well, l hadn't thought.

362
00:24:32,818 --> 00:24:34,376
l suppose it's possible

363
00:24:34,486 --> 00:24:37,944
ifthe exposure
was sufficiently intense.

364
00:24:42,694 --> 00:24:45,219
Let's say those men died
from radiation exposure.

365
00:24:45,297 --> 00:24:47,561
Couldn't it have been
from the cracked core

366
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:48,998
ofa nuclearwarhead?

367
00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:51,262
l've read about
these kinds ofburns.

368
00:24:51,336 --> 00:24:53,600
So have l--
in Hiroshima at ground zero.

369
00:24:53,672 --> 00:24:55,936
l'm talking about
close encounter mortalities.

370
00:24:56,008 --> 00:24:58,670
l have a stack ofX-Files
reporting the same results.

371
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:01,042
l don't claim to know
all the answers

372
00:25:01,113 --> 00:25:03,775
but ifwe don't make
the O.P.R. inquest

373
00:25:03,882 --> 00:25:05,008
by tomorrow morning

374
00:25:05,117 --> 00:25:07,551
there may not be
any more X-Files.

375
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:17,090
(moaning)

376
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:24,067
(moaning)

377
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:53,396
Start an l.V. here, stat.

378
00:25:53,465 --> 00:25:54,989
Mulder:
Tell us what happened.

379
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:57,661
Whatever happened
has nothing to do with you.

380
00:25:57,736 --> 00:25:59,294
Wrong, Colonel.

381
00:25:59,371 --> 00:26:01,999
We want the same thing,
onlyyou want it dead.

382
00:26:02,074 --> 00:26:03,769
Can'tyou see that
chasing it down

383
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:06,538
leaves it no choice
but to defend itself?

384
00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:10,104
How many more have to die before
you rethinkyour approach?

385
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:11,273
Listen to me

386
00:26:11,383 --> 00:26:12,907
'cause l'm not wasting
another breath on this.

387
00:26:13,018 --> 00:26:14,451
lfyou and your partner

388
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:16,111
aren't out ofhere
in 30 seconds...

389
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:18,086
Agent Scully stays here.

390
00:26:18,156 --> 00:26:20,716
We're undermanned,
she's a doctor-- she stays.

391
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:21,918
lfthat's okay.

392
00:26:21,994 --> 00:26:22,926
Ofcourse.

393
00:26:22,995 --> 00:26:23,927
lfyou don't mind

394
00:26:23,996 --> 00:26:25,429
youjust take care ofmy men

395
00:26:25,497 --> 00:26:26,930
and let me do mywork.

396
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:32,326
Outside this emergency room
you can do whateveryou want

397
00:26:32,404 --> 00:26:34,531
but in here l call the shots--

398
00:26:34,606 --> 00:26:36,198
assuming, ofcourse

399
00:26:36,275 --> 00:26:39,870
you want me to take care
ofyour men.

400
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,545
Get this man

401
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:45,310
out ofmy sight.

402
00:26:47,686 --> 00:26:50,018
Where do l scrub up?

403
00:27:05,404 --> 00:27:07,497
Max.

404
00:27:08,607 --> 00:27:10,575
Hey, Max.

405
00:27:10,642 --> 00:27:12,007
Max.

406
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:58,088
Hey... Max.

407
00:27:58,156 --> 00:28:02,217
Who are... who areyou?

408
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:06,424
Max, it's me, Fox Mulder.

409
00:28:06,498 --> 00:28:08,989
You okay?

410
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:12,002
What areyou doing here?

411
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:18,843
You were having
some kind ofseizure.

412
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,844
Seizure?

413
00:28:20,912 --> 00:28:23,278
That's impossible.

414
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,158
You were lying on the foor
unconscious, convulsing.

415
00:28:34,226 --> 00:28:36,660
That's odd.

416
00:28:36,728 --> 00:28:39,595
l haven't had an episode
in seven years--

417
00:28:39,664 --> 00:28:42,792
not since l went on medication.

418
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:46,865
Let's getyou to the hospital.

419
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:48,030
No.

420
00:28:48,106 --> 00:28:51,007
l mean, l mean
it's not necessary.

421
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:52,202
You sure?

422
00:28:52,277 --> 00:28:55,303
Yeah. l lived with epilepsy
all my life.

423
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,508
l'm not in any danger.

424
00:29:09,761 --> 00:29:12,161
Yeah, it started
in South Dakota

425
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,720
when l was ten.

426
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:17,200
The doctor said l must
have incurred a head injury.

427
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:19,897
l don't remember
ever hitting my head.

428
00:29:19,971 --> 00:29:22,633
You have no memory
ofyour seizures?

429
00:29:22,707 --> 00:29:26,473
As a kid l used to wake up
in strange places

430
00:29:26,545 --> 00:29:30,504
with no idea where l was
or how l got there.

431
00:29:30,582 --> 00:29:33,551
(sighs)

432
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,583
Sorry. l...

433
00:29:36,655 --> 00:29:39,488
l got to,
l got to go to sleep.

434
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:41,082
All right.

435
00:30:34,646 --> 00:30:36,614
(sighing)

436
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:38,615
Rough night, huh?

437
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:40,708
lt was terrible.

438
00:30:40,785 --> 00:30:42,878
We lost all but two

439
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:45,081
and they're still
in critical condition

440
00:30:45,157 --> 00:30:47,421
on theirway
to the burn unit

441
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:49,255
atJohns Hopkins.

442
00:30:49,327 --> 00:30:51,795
So what doyou think, Scully?

443
00:30:51,863 --> 00:30:53,763
What's going on out there?

444
00:30:53,832 --> 00:30:56,630
l don't know, and under
other circumstances

445
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:58,601
l would like to find out

446
00:30:58,703 --> 00:31:02,662
but we have a plane to catch
injust over an hour.

447
00:31:02,774 --> 00:31:06,210
l wantyou to take
a look at something first.

448
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:07,210
What?

449
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,576
Max.

450
00:31:08,647 --> 00:31:11,844
There's an unusual incision
behind his left ear.

451
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:14,477
l've seen this incision
twice before.

452
00:31:15,887 --> 00:31:18,117
Two women--
a thousand miles apart

453
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,658
no way ofknowing each other,
no relation.

454
00:31:20,725 --> 00:31:23,558
both claim to have been
abducted by aliens.

455
00:31:23,628 --> 00:31:27,894
areyou saying Max Fenig
is an abductee?

456
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:30,961
Mulder

457
00:31:31,069 --> 00:31:34,004
the man is taking
powerful antipsychotic drugs.

458
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:36,336
l saw them in his R.V.

459
00:31:36,408 --> 00:31:38,842
They're for his epilepsy.

460
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,969
Dilantin is an anti-convulsant

461
00:31:41,046 --> 00:31:44,504
but Mellaril is used exclusively
to treat schizophrenia.

462
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:47,313
More than likely,
Max is delusional.

463
00:31:47,385 --> 00:31:49,410
You don't seem
to understand, Scully.

464
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:52,422
Max doesn't believe
he was abducted by aliens.

465
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,082
l believe he was.

466
00:31:56,027 --> 00:32:00,054
Now, could you at least
take a look at the scar

467
00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:02,565
and give meyour
medical opinion?

468
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:04,534
Okay.

469
00:32:04,603 --> 00:32:06,594
You pack.

470
00:32:06,671 --> 00:32:11,665
l'll take a look at Max
on the way to the airport.

471
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:16,406
Sir, l have fash traffic
at 24-1 8.

472
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:19,075
Repeated calls for l.D.
go unanswered

473
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:22,916
and it's not in the orbital
or sub-orbital inventory.

474
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:24,956
24-1 8--
isn't that where..?

475
00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:26,422
Same exact spot, sir

476
00:32:26,491 --> 00:32:28,925
though l am reading
a much larger craft.

477
00:32:28,994 --> 00:32:30,791
Meteor, Ms. Koretz.

478
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:34,559
A much larger meteor, sir.

479
00:32:36,201 --> 00:32:37,964
Hold on a second.

480
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:39,331
We have a confirm.

481
00:32:39,437 --> 00:32:41,337
Whitmarsh Air Force Base
is tracking.

482
00:32:41,406 --> 00:32:42,532
Where is it?

483
00:32:42,641 --> 00:32:46,577
Well, sir, the meteor
seems to be hovering

484
00:32:46,678 --> 00:32:49,704
over a small town
in eastern Wisconsin.

485
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:50,204
Come on, Mulder,
let's get this overwith.

486
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,370
Hey, Max.

487
00:33:54,446 --> 00:33:55,606
Max.

488
00:33:57,382 --> 00:33:59,009
Max?

489
00:33:59,084 --> 00:34:01,052
Hey, Max.

490
00:34:07,726 --> 00:34:09,216
Max?

491
00:34:10,395 --> 00:34:12,989
Mulder, look at this.

492
00:34:13,064 --> 00:34:15,498
Mulder:
What is that? Blood?

493
00:34:23,641 --> 00:34:26,337
Man:Falcon Patrol
reporting unidentifiedtrespass.

494
00:34:26,411 --> 00:34:29,972
Repeat. Falcon Patrolreporting
unidentifiedtrespass
at the waterfront

495
00:34:35,653 --> 00:34:37,348
Mulder!

496
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:38,286
Come on.

497
00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:40,722
Where doyou think
you're going?

498
00:34:40,792 --> 00:34:43,659
lfwe go to the airport now,
we might make the plane

499
00:34:43,728 --> 00:34:45,355
which would giveyou
halfa chance

500
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,658
ofdefending yourself.

501
00:34:46,731 --> 00:34:47,663
Think about it.

502
00:34:47,732 --> 00:34:49,700
Max is a gypsy,
nomad, right?

503
00:34:49,768 --> 00:34:50,757
Yes. So what?

504
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:52,735
He intercepted
Wright's last call

505
00:34:52,837 --> 00:34:54,031
to his dispatcher

506
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:56,733
which means he was here
in Townsend, Wisconsin

507
00:34:56,841 --> 00:34:58,240
the night ofthe crash.

508
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:01,369
Ofall the places he could
have been, he was here.

509
00:35:01,446 --> 00:35:02,470
lf Max
was abducted

510
00:35:02,547 --> 00:35:03,844
that would go
a long way

511
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:05,542
to explaining
his obsessions.

512
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:09,917
lfwe figure that out, you
can be sure Henderson has.

513
00:35:09,988 --> 00:35:11,956
Doyou have the keys?

514
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,938
(panting)

515
00:35:40,485 --> 00:35:41,816
Don't do this.

516
00:35:41,886 --> 00:35:43,979
Sir, we've apprehended
the target, a civilian.

517
00:35:44,055 --> 00:35:45,488
Negative, Falcon patrol.

518
00:35:45,557 --> 00:35:47,525
Take him
with extreme caution.

519
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:10,614
They're dead.

520
00:36:10,682 --> 00:36:12,582
(Max groaning)

521
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,354
Max:
lt hurts. Stop.

522
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:30,094
Why? Why? Why?

523
00:36:30,168 --> 00:36:31,795
lt hurts.

524
00:36:31,903 --> 00:36:33,097
Max?

525
00:36:33,204 --> 00:36:34,193
lt hurts.

526
00:36:34,305 --> 00:36:35,533
Stop. lt hurts.

527
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,800
lt hurts. lt hurts.

528
00:36:36,908 --> 00:36:38,136
lt's all right.

529
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:39,301
Stop it!

530
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:40,741
...lt hurts.

531
00:36:40,812 --> 00:36:42,677
No, no, it's me they...

532
00:36:42,747 --> 00:36:44,078
They're coming for me.

533
00:36:44,148 --> 00:36:45,547
No, l know that...

534
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:47,084
that's why they're here.

535
00:36:47,151 --> 00:36:48,618
They're coming for me.

536
00:36:48,686 --> 00:36:50,278
(helicopterwhirring)

537
00:36:50,355 --> 00:36:51,686
lt hurts.

538
00:36:51,756 --> 00:36:53,690
(moaning)

539
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,967
Alpha team, secure the roof.

540
00:37:10,942 --> 00:37:12,603
Hold it right there!

541
00:37:12,677 --> 00:37:15,805
Putyour hands up
and come with us!

542
00:37:29,961 --> 00:37:32,020
Alpha team, ready on the roof.

543
00:37:33,731 --> 00:37:36,029
Roger, Alpha.
Delta team, report.

544
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,000
Delta team in position, sir.

545
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:42,736
What areyou doing?

546
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:44,274
You have a very sick man
in there.

547
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,843
We're not in the hospital now,
Dr. Scully.

548
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:48,310
Omega team, report.

549
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,778
He's a delusional
schizophrenic.

550
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:54,181
Keep her clear.

551
00:37:54,252 --> 00:37:56,117
Sir, this is Alpha team leader.

552
00:37:56,187 --> 00:37:58,985
l'm picking up three forms
inside the structure.

553
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:01,355
Henderson:
Did you say
three forms?

554
00:38:01,426 --> 00:38:03,018
That's affirmative.

555
00:38:04,262 --> 00:38:05,251
Two are proximate

556
00:38:05,296 --> 00:38:10,256
the third approaching
from 40 meters.

557
00:38:11,936 --> 00:38:16,771
All teams prepare for go
in 30 seconds.

558
00:38:16,841 --> 00:38:18,968
Come on. Come on, Max.

559
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:21,034
Why... stop. Why...

560
00:38:21,112 --> 00:38:23,876
l'm here to helpyou.

561
00:38:23,948 --> 00:38:25,472
l'm scared.

562
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,949
l know.

563
00:38:27,018 --> 00:38:28,280
Don't let them take me.

564
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:30,651
Mulder:
l won't let them takeyou.

565
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:31,518
Come on, Max.

566
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:34,149
Come with me.

567
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,327
No!

568
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:46,266
Max!

569
00:38:53,277 --> 00:38:56,144
Max!

570
00:39:03,087 --> 00:39:04,987
Max!

571
00:39:12,463 --> 00:39:13,987
Max!

572
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:40,580
Sir, this is Alpha team leader.

573
00:39:40,658 --> 00:39:41,920
Except for our men

574
00:39:41,993 --> 00:39:44,291
l'm only picking up
one figure inside.

575
00:39:44,362 --> 00:39:45,522
l do not copy that.

576
00:39:45,596 --> 00:39:46,995
We indicate only one figure

577
00:39:47,098 --> 00:39:48,929
inside the building.

578
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:50,398
What?

579
00:39:50,468 --> 00:39:51,628
Soldier:
Blow the door!

580
00:39:54,939 --> 00:39:56,372
Take him!

581
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:04,080
(soldiers chattering)

582
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:05,912
That's your unit, sir.

583
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,049
Where is he?

584
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:16,290
He's gone.
They got to him first.

585
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,351
They beat us, Colonel.

586
00:40:18,429 --> 00:40:20,397
Arrest him.

587
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:24,435
And keep looking.

588
00:40:29,006 --> 00:40:30,405
Agent Scully

589
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:34,571
to the best ofyour knowledge,
was Agent Mulder ever assigned

590
00:40:34,645 --> 00:40:37,842
to investigate matters
related to the evacuation

591
00:40:37,915 --> 00:40:39,473
ofTownsend, Wisconsin?

592
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,812
No, sir.

593
00:40:40,885 --> 00:40:42,045
At any time

594
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,680
wereyou aware ofhis
submitting a Form 302

595
00:40:44,756 --> 00:40:48,021
requesting said assignment
or travel expenses?

596
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:49,559
No, sir.

597
00:40:49,627 --> 00:40:50,821
While in Wisconsin

598
00:40:50,895 --> 00:40:53,693
did Agent Mulder drive
a blue Ford Taurus

599
00:40:53,798 --> 00:40:57,962
registered to
the State Car rental agency?

600
00:40:58,069 --> 00:40:59,434
Yes, sir.

601
00:40:59,504 --> 00:41:01,301
Thankyou,
Agent Scully.

602
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:04,102
Sir, request permission
to make a statement.

603
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:05,540
Request denied.

604
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,977
Sir, it's unfair tojudge Mulder
by the same criteria...

605
00:41:09,046 --> 00:41:10,240
You're dismissed.

606
00:41:10,314 --> 00:41:12,077
But, sir...

607
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,880
That will be all.

608
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,527
You hear that noise,
Scully?

609
00:41:27,632 --> 00:41:29,395
Hammer and nails.

610
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,469
They're building a gallows
in the town square.

611
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,471
Don't worry.

612
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:39,442
lt was
only a matter oftime.

613
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:42,775
l'm surprised
l lasted this long.

614
00:41:42,847 --> 00:41:44,838
Good luck.

615
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:47,885
l'll break a leg.

616
00:42:06,804 --> 00:42:09,967
McGrath: ...as well as
insubordination and misconduct.

617
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:14,205
How doyou respond to
these allegations, Agent Mulder?

618
00:42:14,278 --> 00:42:16,109
Over a dozen men
lost their lives

619
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,808
and you want me to respond
to issues ofprotocol?

620
00:42:18,883 --> 00:42:21,943
You failed to obtain proper
authorization foryour actions.

621
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:23,646
l knew it wouldn't
be forthcoming.

622
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:25,655
You also violated
a Federal quarant...

623
00:42:25,723 --> 00:42:27,554
A cover-up was underway...

624
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:29,718
Exposing yourself
and possibly others

625
00:42:29,794 --> 00:42:32,456
to toxic contamination!

626
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:33,758
Oh, toxic contamination.
Are we back in that?

627
00:42:33,865 --> 00:42:34,991
You read my report.

628
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:37,192
Explain Max Fenig's
disappearance.

629
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:39,565
Your report is not the subject
ofthis inquiry.

630
00:42:39,637 --> 00:42:43,073
X rays taken while Mr. Fenig
was institutionalized

631
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,041
showed an object
lodged in his cerebellum.

632
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,078
That is irrelevant,
Agent Mulder.

633
00:42:48,145 --> 00:42:49,442
The man was abducted.

634
00:42:49,513 --> 00:42:51,378
Everybody in this room knows it.

635
00:42:51,449 --> 00:42:55,078
Colonel Henderson's
written testimony states

636
00:42:55,152 --> 00:42:58,849
that Fenig's body
was found two hours later

637
00:42:58,923 --> 00:43:00,914
in a cargo container.

638
00:43:05,863 --> 00:43:07,854
Then what can l say?

639
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,668
How can l disprove lies
that are stamped

640
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:13,066
with an official seal?

641
00:43:13,137 --> 00:43:14,900
That will be all,
Mr. Mulder.

642
00:43:14,972 --> 00:43:16,269
(sighing)

643
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,706
You can deny all the things
l've seen

644
00:43:18,776 --> 00:43:22,234
all the things l've discovered,
but not for much longer

645
00:43:22,313 --> 00:43:25,180
'cause too many know
what's happening out there

646
00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:28,946
and no one,
no government agency

647
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,386
hasjurisdiction
over the truth.

648
00:44:04,722 --> 00:44:07,282
Why did you countermand
our decision?

649
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:09,849
Mulder's conduct
was in clearviolation

650
00:44:09,927 --> 00:44:13,226
not only of Bureau procedures,
but of Federal Law.

651
00:44:13,297 --> 00:44:14,321
Yes.

652
00:44:14,432 --> 00:44:15,626
l don't understand.

653
00:44:15,733 --> 00:44:18,031
The committee's case
was airtight.

654
00:44:18,102 --> 00:44:20,593
You've ruined the last
best chance we had

655
00:44:20,705 --> 00:44:21,933
to get rid ofhim.

656
00:44:22,006 --> 00:44:23,871
l appreciate
your frustration

657
00:44:23,941 --> 00:44:26,808
butyou and l both know
that Mulder's work--

658
00:44:26,877 --> 00:44:29,744
his, uh... singular passion--

659
00:44:29,814 --> 00:44:32,374
poses a most unique dilemma

660
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:35,977
but his occasional
insubordination

661
00:44:36,053 --> 00:44:38,248
is in the end
far less dangerous.

662
00:44:38,322 --> 00:44:39,949
With respect, sir--

663
00:44:40,024 --> 00:44:41,651
less dangerous than what?

664
00:44:41,726 --> 00:44:45,127
Than having him exposed
to the wrong people--

665
00:44:45,196 --> 00:44:47,221
what he knows...

666
00:44:47,331 --> 00:44:50,027
what he thinks he knows.

667
00:44:50,134 --> 00:44:52,659
(sighing)

668
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:58,140
Always keepyour friends
close, Mr. McGrath

669
00:44:58,209 --> 00:45:01,201
but keepyour enemies closer.
