another car at the airport,

501
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:05,868
under the name
" Forau" again.

502
00:37:05,937 --> 00:37:08,997
- Did you hear what I said ?
- Mulder, look.

503
00:37:09,073 --> 00:37:11,007
Arrows that form a circle.

504
00:37:12,143 --> 00:37:14,509
" Full circle
to find the truth."

505
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:16,944
Gates's company owns
a recycling plant near here.

506
00:37:17,015 --> 00:37:19,415
- That's where he's taken Kevin.
- Scully, the man is at the airport.

507
00:37:19,484 --> 00:37:22,544
If he hasn't already killed Kevin, he's
trying to get as far away as he can.

508
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,781
I don't think so, Mulder.

509
00:37:26,057 --> 00:37:29,424
You think it's you,
don’t you ?

510
00:37:29,494 --> 00:37:31,724
You think you’re the one
who's been chosen to protect Kevin.

511
00:37:31,796 --> 00:37:35,197
I don't know.
Look, if I’m wrong,

512
00:37:35,266 --> 00:37:37,257
I'll meet you out
at the airport, okay ?

513
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:56,250
[Gates]
The sun will be turned into darkness,

514
00:37:56,321 --> 00:38:00,257
and the moon
will turn to blood,

515
00:38:00,325 --> 00:38:02,293
because of you, son.

516
00:38:03,528 --> 00:38:05,553
Is that why
you want to hurt me ?

517
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:11,463
It's not a question
of wanting.

518
00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:13,470
You have to die,
Kevin.

519
00:38:14,739 --> 00:38:16,764
For everyone.

520
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:22,570
For the New Age
to come.

521
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,979
You understand that,
don’t you ?

522
00:38:35,193 --> 00:38:38,594
The others were
all false prophets.

523
00:38:38,663 --> 00:38:41,928
You are the only...
True One...

524
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,264
among the 1 2.

525
00:38:46,037 --> 00:38:47,800
[Footsteps]

526
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:50,397
Stop ! Federal agent !
I'm armed !

527
00:38:50,475 --> 00:38:53,239
Let him go.
Let him go...

528
00:38:53,344 --> 00:38:55,073
and we’ll talk about it.

529
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:59,878
There’s nothing to talk about!
I was called upon!

530
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:18,032
No ! Let me go !
Let me go !

531
00:39:20,405 --> 00:39:22,339
Let me go!

532
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:36,852
No !

533
00:39:47,632 --> 00:39:50,624
Kevin. Hold on.
Hold on.

534
00:39:52,403 --> 00:39:56,169
- Hold on.
- [ Grunting, Whimpering ]

535
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,869
- Oh !
- I knew you’d come.

536
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,223
You all set ?

537
00:40:23,768 --> 00:40:25,702
Thanks.

538
00:40:34,612 --> 00:40:38,139
Maybe I'll see you
again sometime.

539
00:40:38,216 --> 00:40:40,980
You will.

540
00:40:44,055 --> 00:40:46,546
-[Woman] You all ready, Kevin ?
-[Kevin] Yeah.

541
00:40:46,657 --> 00:40:49,592
[Door Opens, Closes]

542
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,641
- You okay ?
- Yeah, I think so.

543
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,270
We got a couple hours before our fight.
I told the sheriff...

544
00:41:08,346 --> 00:41:11,179
we'd go down and make a formal statement
about Gates's death.

545
00:41:11,249 --> 00:41:16,915
[ Sighs ] I'd appreciate it
if you’d handle that alone, Mulder.

546
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:19,353
I have an errand
I need to run.

547
00:41:22,026 --> 00:41:23,960
Okay.

548
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:33,101
I'll see you
at the airport.

549
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,911
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

550
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:51,080
It has been six years
since my last confession,

551
00:41:51,189 --> 00:41:53,123
and...

552
00:41:53,191 --> 00:41:56,160
since then, I've drifted
away from the Church.

553
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:59,593
I'm not sure why,
exactly.

554
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:02,861
Have you come to confess ?

555
00:42:03,935 --> 00:42:07,393
No, um--

556
00:42:08,573 --> 00:42:11,269
There's a man
that I work with.

557
00:42:11,342 --> 00:42:16,075
A friend. And usually, I'm able
to discuss these things with him.

558
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:21,079
But not this.

559
00:42:24,922 --> 00:42:28,119
Father, do you believe
in miracles ?

560
00:42:28,192 --> 00:42:30,524
Of course.
I see them every day.

561
00:42:30,595 --> 00:42:33,086
The rising sun,
the birth of a child--

562
00:42:33,164 --> 00:42:37,828
No, I'm-- I'm talking about events
that defy explanation.

563
00:42:40,504 --> 00:42:44,497
Things that...

564
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:47,703
I believe helped me to save
a young boy's life.

565
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,172
But now I wonder
if I saw them at all.

566
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,741
If I didn't
just imagine them.

567
00:42:54,819 --> 00:42:56,787
Why do you doubt yourself?

568
00:42:59,457 --> 00:43:02,426
Because my partner
didn't see them.

569
00:43:02,493 --> 00:43:04,393
He didn't--

570
00:43:04,462 --> 00:43:06,726
He didn't believe them.

571
00:43:08,633 --> 00:43:11,534
And usually, he--
[ Sighs ]

572
00:43:11,602 --> 00:43:14,196
he believes
without question.

573
00:43:14,272 --> 00:43:16,763
Maybe they weren’t meant
for him to see.

574
00:43:16,841 --> 00:43:20,675
- Maybe they were only meant for you.
- Is that possible ?

575
00:43:20,745 --> 00:43:24,545
With the Lord,
anything is possible.

576
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:27,345
Perhaps you saw these things
because you needed to.

577
00:43:30,288 --> 00:43:32,756
To find my way back ?

578
00:43:32,857 --> 00:43:35,951
Sometimes we must come full circle
to find the truth.

579
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,960
Why does
that surprise you ?

580
00:43:42,767 --> 00:43:45,964
Mostly, it just
makes me afraid.

581
00:43:46,037 --> 00:43:47,971
Afraid ?

582
00:43:51,509 --> 00:43:53,841
Afraid that God
is speaking...

583
00:43:57,581 --> 00:44:00,311
but that
no one's listening.
