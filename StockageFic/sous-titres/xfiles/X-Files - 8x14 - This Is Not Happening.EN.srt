00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,273
It won't die, that light.

184
00:12:46,345 --> 00:12:51,715
Maybe that's the only
thing that never does.

He said that's
where souls reside.

186
00:13:02,628 --> 00:13:04,823
I hope he's right.

187
00:13:16,843 --> 00:13:19,437
If you're trying
to prepare yourself

188
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:20,843
I want you to stop.

189
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,815
Nothing says
that we're going

190
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,411
to stumble over him
in some fiield.

191
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:31,719
Nothing says he won't be fiine.

192
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:00,813
May I help you, sir?

193
00:14:03,923 --> 00:14:06,790
Yes, I want to have
a patient transferred.

194
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:08,258
Teresa Hoese.

195
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:09,851
To be transferred?

196
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:11,362
To another facility.

197
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,297
I'd like to get her ready
as soon as we can.

198
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:15,800
Okay.

199
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:40,922
[ Ringing ]

200
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:45,457
Yeah?

201
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:47,396
Hold on.

202
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:50,299
Who took her?

203
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:53,271
Well, has anybody talked
to the doctor and asked him why?

204
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,773
Or where?

205
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:57,775
Well, where's Agent Doggett now?

206
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:09,550
Did you fiind her?

207
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:10,953
No.

208
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,987
No? I don't understand.

209
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:14,989
You called us
all the way out here.

210
00:15:15,228 --> 00:15:17,196
To get another point of view.

211
00:15:17,263 --> 00:15:18,696
Another point of view?

212
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:21,733
We have a patient
missing, Agent Doggett.

213
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,359
You should just hear her out.

214
00:15:23,436 --> 00:15:25,404
Hear who out?

215
00:15:29,942 --> 00:15:32,934
Her name's Monica Reyes.

216
00:15:33,012 --> 00:15:35,003
I worked a case
with her once.

217
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:36,010
She's FBI?

218
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:37,216
Yeah.

219
00:15:37,283 --> 00:15:38,375
She's got some expertise

220
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:40,248
I thought we might
take advantage of.

221
00:15:40,286 --> 00:15:42,345
Expertise in what?

222
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:44,389
She's got her master's
in religious studies.

223
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:46,254
Her specialization is
ritualistic crime.

224
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:47,724
Ritualistic crime?

225
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:51,488
Are we working
the same case here?

226
00:15:56,402 --> 00:15:58,427
Agent Reyes.

227
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:04,439
Assistant Director
Skinner, Agent Scully...

228
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,841
Monica Reyes.

229
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:09,413
Hi.

230
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:15,912
Beautiful country out here.

231
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:24,988
I know it's not very FBI of me,
but I'm really trying to quit.

232
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:28,864
So, Agent Doggett's been
taking me through the case.

233
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:30,595
Interesting.

234
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,932
Interesting?

235
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:33,335
What do you think
happened?

236
00:16:33,406 --> 00:16:36,739
Isn't that what
you're here to tell us?

237
00:16:36,776 --> 00:16:38,038
Oh, I have my own thoughts.

238
00:16:38,077 --> 00:16:39,669
It's just, what
we think happened

239
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:42,509
and what actually happened
aren't always the same thing

240
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:44,549
but not altogether
insignifiicant, either.

241
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,017
I'm sorry, this
feels like therapy.

242
00:16:47,086 --> 00:16:48,644
What happened being different

243
00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:50,586
from what we want
to have happened.

244
00:16:50,623 --> 00:16:52,591
What who wants
to have happened?

245
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,560
Well, I'm told this case
involves you.

246
00:16:58,064 --> 00:17:00,555
It may involve
someone close to me.

247
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:02,498
Can we stick to
the facts, please?

248
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:03,865
Well, it's pretty clear

249
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:06,097
that the woman who was
found out here

250
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:08,102
did not inflict
her own injuries.

251
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:10,434
That she was dropped here
by someone

252
00:17:10,476 --> 00:17:13,934
and whoever it was cared about
her enough not to kill her.

253
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:15,412
Did you happen to know

254
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:17,608
the peculiar nature
of her injuries?

255
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:20,550
Yes. They were peculiar,
but not altogether different

256
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,814
from your typical cult
ritualistic abuse.

257
00:17:22,855 --> 00:17:24,379
Agent Reyes, we're dealing

258
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:26,448
with abductions here...

259
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:28,425
not by any cult.

260
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:29,722
Okay. Good.

261
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:31,729
I mean, if it's not.

262
00:17:31,797 --> 00:17:34,527
But you think that it is.

263
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,763
Well, I go on what
I know, of course

264
00:17:37,837 --> 00:17:40,863
but I try to stay,
you know, open.

265
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,067
So, what do you think happened?

266
00:17:43,142 --> 00:17:45,542
Well, I'm told
thatAgent Mulder

267
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:47,875
and the other people who were
taken were true believers.

268
00:17:47,947 --> 00:17:50,711
People 100% convinced in
the abduction phenomenon.

269
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,412
If this is about these people
staging their own abductions...

270
00:17:53,486 --> 00:17:55,886
No, it's about people
coming together.

271
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:57,513
Like minds as a group.

272
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,717
So you're basically saying that

273
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:02,989
Agent Mulder has joined some
sort of UFO cult.

274
00:18:03,062 --> 00:18:05,963
Call it a group.

275
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:07,055
For what?

276
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:08,691
Well, we've all heard
the news stories

277
00:18:08,768 --> 00:18:10,599
about transport
to a mother ship

278
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:12,501
the idea of a giant
mother wheel.

279
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:15,438
The whole Heaven's Gate thing.

280
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:17,499
I see.

281
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:19,066
It'd make sense.

282
00:18:19,145 --> 00:18:20,942
The leader of
the cult leaves

283
00:18:21,013 --> 00:18:22,776
this woman out
here to die.

284
00:18:22,815 --> 00:18:24,146
Learning she's still alive

285
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,374
he comes back to kidnap her again
for fear of exposure.

286
00:18:26,452 --> 00:18:28,613
It'd make sense, too

287
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:31,588
that if we fiind this guy,
maybe we fiind Mulder.

288
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:34,125
Are you asking me
to believe this?

289
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:36,991
[ Reyes ]
No. That's not what I said.

290
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:40,793
I don't think
he left her to die.

291
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:41,958
I don't think she's dead.

292
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:43,934
Based on what?

293
00:18:44,003 --> 00:18:47,996
Nothing, really.

294
00:18:48,073 --> 00:18:50,633
It's just a feeling.

295
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:00,919
What are you
walking away for?

296
00:19:00,986 --> 00:19:02,510
It makes
some kind of sense.

297
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:04,716
I'm glad you agree with her,
Agent Doggett

298
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,554
because I'm not even sure
that she agrees with you.

299
00:19:07,593 --> 00:19:09,925
Nor has she made any sense
for me of how the doctor

300
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:12,623
who removed Teresa Hoese
from the hospital last night

301
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:15,496
seems, by all accounts
to have been in two places at once.

302
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:18,867
I know where you're going
with this, Agent Scully

303
00:19:18,938 --> 00:19:21,566
but if you're going
to tell me this is

304
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,505
another alien bounty hunter

305
00:19:23,576 --> 00:19:26,136
this is where
we part company.

306
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:28,112
Enjoy your new company.

307
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,190
How is she?

308
00:19:51,604 --> 00:19:54,937
We were almost too late.

309
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:43,678
Oh, hi.

310
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,957
I thought you'd be out
combing the hills

311
00:20:48,994 --> 00:20:50,052
with Agent Doggett.

312
00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:51,994
I'm on my way out to see him.

313
00:20:52,064 --> 00:20:55,591
I just wanted to see fiilm
on this woman's injuries--

314
00:20:55,668 --> 00:20:56,600
Teresa Hoese.

315
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:05,266
Is there something you're
looking for, Agent Reyes

316
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:07,312
in particular?

317
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:09,343
Implants,
or signs of them.

318
00:21:09,548 --> 00:21:12,711
Implants?

319
00:21:12,785 --> 00:21:13,809
I don't understand.

320
00:21:13,852 --> 00:21:16,650
Metallic implants
placed in the body

321
00:21:16,722 --> 00:21:18,952
oftentimes in
the nasal cavity.

322
00:21:19,024 --> 00:21:20,355
Sometimes made of bone
or cartilage

323
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:22,220
making detection
a little more diffiicult.

324
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:24,728
Yeah, I'm well aware
of how they work.

325
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:27,698
You said you didn't
understand.

326
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:29,257
I don't understand your interest

327
00:21:29,335 --> 00:21:32,327
in what is commonly considered
evidence of alien abduction

328
00:21:32,571 --> 00:21:34,198
as a disbeliever
in that phenomena.

329
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:36,207
I'm not a disbeliever.

330
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:40,676
Excuse me.
I, I, uh, I'm very confused.

331
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:42,008
I know what I heard

332
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:45,209
and I heard you say that
""What we're dealing with here is

333
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:47,081
nothing more than a UFO cult.""

334
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,609
There's the confusion.

335
00:21:48,687 --> 00:21:49,949
I still believe that

336
00:21:50,022 --> 00:21:53,287
but it doesn't mean I don't
believe in the phenomena.

337
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,726
You believe in extraterrestrials?

338
00:21:56,795 --> 00:21:59,662
[ Chuckles ]

339
00:21:59,732 --> 00:22:01,927
Let's just say
I don't not believe.

340
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:03,935
As I said,
I try to stay open.

341
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:12,307
What is it
you specialize in again?

342
00:22:12,378 --> 00:22:14,107
Ritualistic crime?

343
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:15,908
Right. Satanic ritual abuse.

344
00:22:15,981 --> 00:22:17,812
Or, I should say
claims of it.

345
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,841
We never found
any hard evidence.

346
00:22:19,918 --> 00:22:21,977
We should talk sometime.

347
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:24,683
Not that I don't
believe in it.

348
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:27,351
I was something
of a black sheep

349
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:29,724
in the fiield offiice
in New Orleans

350
00:22:29,795 --> 00:22:31,763
because of my beliefs.

351
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,196
And what beliefs are those?

352
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:38,032
I just have
certain spiritual notions.

353
00:22:38,103 --> 00:22:42,665
I believe there are energies
in the universe.

354
00:22:42,741 --> 00:22:44,436
It might sound
kind of cosmic

355
00:22:44,677 --> 00:22:46,736
but I think
I'm sensitive to them.

356
00:22:46,812 --> 00:22:49,076
I mean, I get these feelings.

357
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,042
And do you have any feelings
aboutAgent Mulder?

358
00:22:54,086 --> 00:22:57,112
I don't know Agent Mulder.

359

about him.

But I am feeling
your fear.
