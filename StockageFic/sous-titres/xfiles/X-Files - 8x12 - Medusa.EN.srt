What is it?

179
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:46,552
There's somebody in the tunnel.

180
00:11:54,227 --> 00:11:57,162
All right, let's go fiind him.

181
00:12:09,308 --> 00:12:11,242
Open this line in four hours...

182
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,642
passengers will get more
than just a ride--

183
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:15,647
they'll get
a steam bath to boot.

184
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:16,773
What are you doing?

185
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:18,347
If this guy was
going to shoot me...

186
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:19,578
he already had his chance.

187
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:23,281
Besides,
I'm sweating like a pig.

188
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:26,018
Mr. Melnick,
what's this?

189
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:27,684
It's a tunnel from
the old system.

190
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,160
Been shut down
for years.

191

You see this, Agent Scully?

192
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:36,292
You have this
on your graphic?

193
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:37,495
Yeah.

194
00:12:37,537 --> 00:12:39,027
It's a fork
in the line.

195
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:40,369
That line is obsolete.

196
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:42,169
It's been gutted
and decommissioned.

197
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:45,335
How far from here to where
the train lost power, Agent Scully?

198

[ Scully ]
It's about a mile up the main tunnel.

199

Yeah.

Nah, give me a minute.

- Would you call that equivocal?
- Agent Scully...

Uh, okay, I see it.

221
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,755
Um, I'm going to need some data.

222
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,190
Agent Scully needs some data.

[ Lyle ]
I'm already on it.

224
00:14:41,661 --> 00:14:43,822
I think this is the guy that
killed Offiicer Philbrick.

Oh, my God.

Where you going?

230
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:03,339
I think I just saw something.

231
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,782
- What's the problem?
- There's no problem.

232
00:15:05,851 --> 00:15:10,550
This man fiits the description
called in by my transit cop.

233
00:15:10,623 --> 00:15:11,954
We found what
we were looking for.

234
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:13,954
Let's get him wrapped up
and go home.

235
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:15,785
See it?

236
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:18,353
There's something
on the floor.

237
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:35,578
[ Doggett ]
Agent Scully...

238
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:38,277
we got bodies.

239
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:41,752
Looks like three males.

Agent Scully?

241
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:45,513
Yeah, I see them.
Can you get any closer?

242
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:49,453
Smell's a little overpowering.

243
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:53,328
They've been here for a while.

244
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,766
Looks like someone wrapped them up
and stashed them down here.

245
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:58,736
Can you get them uncovered?

246
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:02,498
They look like squatters,
from the way they're dressed.

247
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:07,910
I'm not sure
I want to touch these.

of the same tissue degradation...

250
00:16:15,421 --> 00:16:18,390
We may have a contagion here
after all.

Oh.

The CDC may be wrong.

what happened to them.

You don't understand.

00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:41,973
They could be infected
and contagious.

00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,876
You are being
irrational here.

00:17:46,946 --> 00:17:48,971

Then who are those dead men
and how did they die?

00:17:55,054 --> 00:17:56,681
Probably tunnel rats.

Squatters attacked by the same man
who killed my transit cop.

285

of your killer, okay?

to risk bringing it up here...

and go after whoever it is
who's in that tunnel.

causing this...
