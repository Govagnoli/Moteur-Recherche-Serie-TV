- You stay back.
- Mommy!

Mommy!

551
00:35:07,051 --> 00:35:08,450
I said stay back!

[ Screaming ]

557
00:35:18,797 --> 00:35:20,025
What have
you done?

558
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:24,060
This man needs help!

559
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:31,766
[ Doggett ]
You're not going to die on me now.

560
00:35:31,843 --> 00:35:32,867
[ Reyes ]
Agent Doggett--

561
00:35:32,944 --> 00:35:33,876
You hear me?

562
00:35:33,945 --> 00:35:35,003
You're going to make it.

563
00:35:35,046 --> 00:35:36,013
You're going to make it.

564
00:35:36,047 --> 00:35:37,412
You hear me?

565
00:35:37,482 --> 00:35:38,915
- [ Reyes ] John.
- No, no, the parade stops here.

566
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:40,109
Now, if you want to save him

567
00:35:40,185 --> 00:35:41,812
let the doctors
do their work, okay?

568
00:35:41,886 --> 00:35:43,649
Who's the immediate
family member here?

569
00:35:43,721 --> 00:35:44,653
I am.

570
00:35:44,722 --> 00:35:45,689
Okay, come with me.

571
00:35:45,757 --> 00:35:46,985
I'm going to need you
to fiill out

572
00:35:47,058 --> 00:35:48,548
some information
for me, all right?

573
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:54,230
There is nothing more
you can do.

574
00:35:54,432 --> 00:35:56,059
You can't tell me that now.

575
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,591
Maybe saving this girl
was the reason.

576
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:02,037
Maybe that's what this
was all about.

577
00:36:02,106 --> 00:36:05,667
Maybe that's what I saw
and why I saw it.

578
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:06,801
For that kid.

579
00:36:11,216 --> 00:36:13,707
Go home,John.

580
00:36:13,785 --> 00:36:16,083
There's nothing here
for you to do.

581
00:37:14,913 --> 00:37:17,108
[ Mulder ]
Agent Doggett.

582
00:37:30,094 --> 00:37:34,087
She just fell
back to sleep.

583
00:37:34,165 --> 00:37:36,759
I just wanted to check
to see how she's doing.

584
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:38,859
Anyways, I'm here
with this other thing.

585
00:37:38,937 --> 00:37:41,030
We, uh, we caught this killer,
Jeb Dukes.

586
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:42,800
He's in the I.C.U.

587
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,205
He may not make it.

588
00:37:44,275 --> 00:37:45,333
And now you're wondering

589
00:37:45,577 --> 00:37:46,942
if there really was
a connection.

590
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,872
You know, when I, uh...

591
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:52,883
I fiirst came
to work at the F.B.I.

592
00:37:52,951 --> 00:37:54,612
I worked at Violent Crimes

593
00:37:54,686 --> 00:37:57,553
and I saw the worst
of humanity.

594
00:37:57,622 --> 00:37:58,953
I saw monsters

595
00:37:59,023 --> 00:38:02,720
and I wondered
how they became that way

596
00:38:02,794 --> 00:38:04,762
how these men became so evil.

597
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:07,923
I know there were
psychological explanations--

598
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:11,833
victims of their environment,
victims of their parents--

599
00:38:11,903 --> 00:38:14,599
but the scientifiic explanations
were never truly satisfying

600
00:38:14,672 --> 00:38:18,233
and I began to think about evil
like a disease.

601
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:21,574
You know, that it goes
from man to man or age to age.

602
00:38:21,646 --> 00:38:23,341
Most of us walk
around thinking

603
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:25,640
we're incapable
of any acts of evil

604
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:26,911
and we are.

605
00:38:26,985 --> 00:38:28,247
You know, we can stifle

606
00:38:28,286 --> 00:38:30,220
that momentary urge
to kill or to hurt.

607
00:38:30,288 --> 00:38:33,655
We have some kind
of immunity to it

608
00:38:33,725 --> 00:38:35,590
but I think
it's possible that there's...

609
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:39,758
an occurrence in somebody's life

610
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:41,287
a tragedy or a loss

611
00:38:41,366 --> 00:38:44,130
that leaves them vulnerable

612
00:38:44,202 --> 00:38:46,636
hurts their immunity to evil

613
00:38:46,671 --> 00:38:47,968
and all of a sudden

614
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:50,405
at that point in their lives

615
00:38:50,642 --> 00:38:54,408
when they're weakened,
they're open to evil

616
00:38:54,646 --> 00:38:56,876
and they can become evil.

617
00:38:56,948 --> 00:39:00,349
If that were true,
then what you're saying is...

618
00:39:00,418 --> 00:39:03,683
is that this man
we wheeled in here tonight

619
00:39:03,755 --> 00:39:06,690
is infected with evil

620
00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:08,988
the same evil
that killed my son.

621
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:14,024
You really believe that,
Agent Mulder?

622
00:39:14,098 --> 00:39:18,967
Uh, I'm not really a good test
for questions like that.

623
00:39:19,037 --> 00:39:21,005
I'll believe almost anything

624
00:39:21,072 --> 00:39:23,165
you know, but the, uh--

625
00:39:23,241 --> 00:39:26,267
the pisser is
you may never know.

626
00:39:26,344 --> 00:39:27,868
It may be like Agent Reyes says.

627
00:39:27,912 --> 00:39:29,903
It could be random
and meaningless--

628
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:31,915
who it affects, who it goes to.

629
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:34,645
What if it isn't?

630
00:39:35,787 --> 00:39:37,379
Well, then you'd be seeing

631
00:39:37,455 --> 00:39:39,787
something I don't,

while I was lying
in my hospital bed
