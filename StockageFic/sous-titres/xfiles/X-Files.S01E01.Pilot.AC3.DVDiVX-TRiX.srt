1
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,100
(panting, footsteps)

2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,600
(panting, footsteps)

3
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:33,700
(grunting, panting)

4
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,100
(groaning)

5
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,200
(rustling)

6
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,800
(rattling)

7
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,400
l'd put the time ofdeath
between 8 and 1 2 hours ago.

8
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,700
No sign ofbattery
or sexual assault.

9
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,100
All we have is this.

10
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,000
Can we turn her over?

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,200
Karen Swenson.

12
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,900
ls that a positive l.D.?

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,300
She went to school with my son.

14
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,800
That would be the class

15
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,800
of'89?

16
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,100
lt's happening again,
isn't it?

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,300
Agent Dana Scully.

18
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,100
Man: Comein.

19
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,000
Thankyou for coming
on such short notice.

20
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,700
Please...

21
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,900
You've been with us
just over twoyears.

22
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,700
Yes, sir.

23
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,700
You went to medical school,
butyou chose not to practice.

24
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,300
How did you come to work
for the F.B.l.?

25
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,500
Well, sir, l was recruited
out ofmedical school.

26
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,700
My parents still think
it was an act ofrebellion

27
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,100
but l saw the F.B.l.

28
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,000
as a place where l could
distinguish myself.

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,400
Areyou familiar
with an agent named Fox Mulder?

30
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,100
Yes, l am.

31
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,800
How so?

32
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,000
By reputation.

33
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,900
He's an Oxford-educated
psychologist

34
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,700
who wrote a monograph on
serial killers and the occult

35
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,200
that helped catch
Monty Propps in 1 988.

36
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,100
Generally thought of
as the best analyst

37
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,800
in the violent
crime section.

38
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,300
He had a nickname
at the academy:

39
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,000
""Spooky"" Mulder.

40
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,600
l'll also tell you that
Agent Mulder

41
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,500
has developed
a consuming devotion

42
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,500
to an unassigned project.

43
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,500
Areyou familiarwith
the so-called X-Files?

44
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,900
l believe they have to do
with unexplained phenomena.

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,900
We wantyou to assist Mulder.

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,600
You will write field reports on
your activities

47
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,800
along with your observations
on the validity ofthe work.

48
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,800
You want me to debunk
the X-Files project?

49
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,700
We trustyou'll make
the proper analysis.

50
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,900
You'll want to contact
Agent Mulder shortly.

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We look forward to seeing your
reports.

52
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,900
Sorry, nobody down here

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,600
but the F.B.l.'s
most unwanted.

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,500
Agent Mulder.

55
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,700
l'm Dana Scully.

56
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,800
l've been assigned
to workwith you.

57
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,300
lsn't it nice
to be so highly regarded?

58
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,900
Who did you
tick off

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,500
to get stuckwith this detail?

60
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,500
Actually, l'm looking forward
to working with you.

61
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,800
l was under the impression
thatyou were sent to spy on me.

62
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,900
lfyou have any doubt
about my qualifications...

63
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,500
You're a medical doctor.

64
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,300
You teach at the academy.

65
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,200
You did your
undergraduate degree in physics.

66
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,300
"" Einstein's Twin Paradox:
A New lnterpretation.""

67
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Dana Scully's senior thesis.

68
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,100
Now that's a credential,
rewriting Einstein.

69
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,500
Did you read it?

70
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,300
l did. l liked it.

71
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,000
ln most ofmywork

72
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,900
the laws ofphysics

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,900
rarely
seem to apply.

74
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,900
Maybe l can get
your medical opinion on this.

75
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,900
Oregon female, age 21 .

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,800
No explainable
cause ofdeath.

77
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,700
Autopsy shows nothing. Zip.

78
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,200
There are, however,
these two distinct marks

79
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,800
on her lower back.

80
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,100
Dr. Scully,
can you l.D. these marks?

81
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,800
Needle punctures, maybe.

82
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,800
An animal bite,
electrocution.

83
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,200
How's your chemistry?

84
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,900
This is the substance found
in the surrounding tissue.

85
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,600
lt's organic.

86
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,100
l don't know.

87
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
ls it some kind
ofsynthetic protein?

88
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,300
Beats me.

89
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,200
l've never seen it, either

90
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,400
but here it is again

91
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,500
in South Dakota,
and again in Texas.

92
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Doyou have a theory?

93
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,500
l have plenty oftheories

94
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,700
but maybe what
you can explain to me

95
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,300
is why it's Bureau policy

96
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,100
to label these cases
""unexplained phenomena""

97
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,300
and ignore them.

98
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,100
Doyou believe in the existence
ofextraterrestrials?

99
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,500
Logically,
l would have to say no.

100
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,800
Given the distances needed

101
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,000
to travel from

102
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,400
the far reaches ofspace

103
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
the energy requirements
would exceed

104
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,000
a spacecraft's
capabilities.

105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,300
Conventional wisdom.
This Oregon female--

106
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,400
she's the fourth person
in her graduating class

107
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,300
to die under
mysterious circumstances.

108
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,200
When convention
and science

109
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,400
offer us no answers

110
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,100
might we not finally turn
to the fantastic

111
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,300
as a plausibility?

112
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,600
The girl obviously
died ofsomething.

113
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,100
lfit was natural causes,
it's plausible

114
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,600
there was something missed
in the postmortem.

115
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,200
lfshe was murdered

116
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,800
it's plausible there was
a sloppy investigation.

117
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,000
What l find fantastic
is any notion

118
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,300
that there are answers
beyond the realm ofscience.

119
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,600
The answers
are there.

120
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,800
You have to know where to look.

121
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,100
That's why they put the ""l""
in F.B.l.

122
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,800
Seeyou tomorrow morning,
Scully, bright and early.

123
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,600
We leave for the very plausible
state ofOregon

124
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,200
at 8:00 a.m.

125
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,300
Pilot: l'd like to ask all passengers
to fasten their seat belts

126
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,500
as we're about
to make our descent...

127
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,100
This must be the place.

128
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,800
You didn't mention yesterday

129
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,300
this case has already
been investigated.

130
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,900
Yeah, the F.B.l. got involved
after the first three deaths

131
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,200
when local authorities
failed to turn up any evidence.

132
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,200
Our boys came out here,
spent a week

133
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,000
enjoyed the local salmon--

134
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,400
which isjust to die for,
ifyou pardon the expression.

135
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Without explanation,
theywere called back in.

136
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,900
The case was reclassified

137
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
and buried in the X-Files
until l dug it up last week.

138
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,200
And you found something
they didn't?

139
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,900
The autopsy reports of
the first three victims

140
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,600
show no unidentified marks
or tissue samples

141
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,200
but those reports were signed
by a different medical examiner

142
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,700
than the latest victim.

143
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,700
That's pretty good, Scully.

144
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,100
Better than you expected,
or better than you hoped?

145
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,800
Well, l'll letyou know
when we get past

146
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,900
the easy part.

147
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,200
ls the medical examiner
a suspect?

148
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,700
We won't know until
we do some grave digging.

149
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,900
l've arranged to exhume
one ofthe othervictims

150
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,300
to see ifwe can get
a tissue sample

151
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,600
to match the girl's.

152
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,600
You're not squeamish,
areyou?

153
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,700
l've never had the pleasure.

154
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,900
(indistinct radio)

155
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,500
(audio feedback)

156
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,500
What's going on?

157
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
What the hell
was that about?

158
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,800
Oh, you know...

159
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,100
probably nothing.

160
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,800
Mr. Mulder,
County Coroner's Office.

161
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah, Hi.

162
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,400
This is Agent Scully.

163
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,700
How soon can
we get started?

164
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,300
We're ready to go.

165
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,800
Wereyou able to arrange
for an examination facility?

166
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,100
Man:
Excuse me.

167
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Excuse me. No.

168
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,300
Please stay in...

169
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,300
l don't know
whoyou people thinkyou are.

170
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,200
You thinkyou can come up here

171
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,000
and do whateveryou damn please,
don'tyou?

172
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,500
l'm sorry. You are..?

173
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,400
jay Nemman,
County Medical Examiner.

174
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,000
Surelyyou must
have been informed.

175
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,200
No. No, we've been away.

176
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,200
Well, that answers
a question we had:

177
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,800
whyyou hadn't done
the recent autopsy.

178
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,000
You're aware of
the tissue sample

179
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,800
that was taken
from her body.

180
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,100
What is the insinuation here?

181
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,700
Areyou saying l missed something
in those kids' exams?

182
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,100
We're not insinuating
anything, sir.

183
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Wait a minute!

184
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,900
Well, l thinkyou are.

185
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,600
lfyou're making an accusation

186
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,800
you'd better have
something to back it up.

187
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,400
Daddy, please,
let'sjust go home.

188
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,700
Let's go home, please!

189
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,400
Guy obviously needed
a longervacation.

190
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,700
Ray Soames
was the third victim.

191
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,200
After graduating high school

192
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,200
he spent time in
a state mental hospital.

193
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,000
treated for post-adolescent
schizophrenia.

194
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,600
Soames confessed
to the first two murders.

195
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,300
He pleaded
to be locked up

196
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,600
but he couldn't produce
any evidence

197
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,500
that he committed
the crimes.

198
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Did you read
the cause ofdeath?

199
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,000
Exposure. His body
was found in the woods

200
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,900
after escaping the hospital.

201
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,300
Missing for only
seven hours inJuly.

202
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,700
How does a 20-year-old
die ofexposure

203
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,200
on a warm, summer night
in Oregon?

204
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,300
This isn't official procedure.

205
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,500
Really?

206
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,600
lt's probably a safe bet
Ray Soames never made

207
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,400
the varsity
basketball team.

208
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,000
Seal this up right now.

209
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,500
Nobody sees or
touches this. Nobody.

210
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,400
This is amazing, Scully.

211
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,700
Doyou know what
this could mean?

212
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,700
lt's almost too big
to even comprehend.

213
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,500
The subject is 1 56
centimeters in length

214
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,100
weighing 52 pounds
in extremis.

215
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,300
Corpse is in advanced
stages ofdecay

216
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,400
and desiccation.

217
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,300
Distinguishing features
include large ocular cavities

218
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,400
oblique cranium--
indicates subject is not human.

219
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,200
Could you point that fash
away from me?

220
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,600
lfit's not human, what is it?

221
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,900
lt's mammalian.

222
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,900
lt's a chimpanzee or
something from the ape family

223
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,700
possibly an orangutan.

224
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,100
Buried in the city cemetery
in Ray's grave?

225
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,400
Try telling that
to the good townsfolk

226
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,200
or to Ray's family.

227
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,500
l want tissue samples,
X rays, blood typing, toxicology

228
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,200
and a full genetic work-up.

229
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,200
What we can't do here,
we'll order to go.

230
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,500
You don't honestly believe
this is an extraterrestrial?

231
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,700
This is somebody's sickjoke.

232
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,100
ls there any reason we can't
do those X rays right now?

233
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,100
l'm not crazy, Scully.

234
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,700
l have the same
doubts you do.

235
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,700
Scully:
Visual laboratory inspection
ofthe body and X-ray analysis

236
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,300
confirms homologous,
but possibly mutated,

237
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,700
mammalian physiology.

238
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,200
However, does not account
for small, unidentified object

239
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,700
found in subject's
nasal cavity.

240
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,700
A grey, metallic implant
forming...

241
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,600
(knocking)

242
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,300
Who is it?

243
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
Steven Spielberg.

244
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,300
l'm going for a run.

245
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,700
Want to come?

246
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,700
Pass.

247
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,800
Figure out what
that little thing is?

248
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,500
No. And l'm not

249
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,100
losing any sleep
over it.

250
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,400
Good night.

251
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,700
Ray Soames was
a patient ofmine.

252
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,400
l oversaw his treatment
for over a year

253
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,200
for clinical schizophrenia.

254
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,500
Ray had an inability
to grasp reality.

255
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,200
he seemed to suffer from some
kind ofpost-traumatic stress.

256
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,200
ls that something
you've seen before?

257
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,800
l've treated
similar cases.

258
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,200
Were any ofthose
Ray Soames' classmates?

259
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,700
Yes.

260
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,700
We're trying to find
a connection in these deaths.

261
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,700
Did you treat any
ofthese kids with hypnosis?

262
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,100
No. l did not.

263
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,700
Areyou treating
any ofthese kids now?

264
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,100
Currently?

265
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,500
Yes, l'm treating
Billy Miles and Peggy O'Dell.

266
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,100
They're here
at this hospital?

267
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,700
Going on
fouryears now.

268
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,200
Would it be possible
to talk to them?

269
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,300
Well, you might
find it difficult.

270
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,900
Certainly in
Billy Miles' case.

271
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,900
Billy's experiencing
what we call a waking coma.

272
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,600
Functionally,
his brain waves are fat.

273
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,100
How did it happen?

274
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,700
He and Peggywere involved
in an automobile accident.

275
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
Doctor:
Peggy?

276
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,600
We have some visitors.

277
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,200
Would you talkwith them?

278
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,500
Billywants me to read now.

279
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,800
Does he like it
when you read to him?

280
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,100
Yes.

281
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,700
Billy needs me close.

282
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,300
Doctor

283
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,500
l'm wondering ifwe can do
a cursory medical exam

284
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,400
on Peggy?

285
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,100
(crashing, yelling)

286
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,400
Peggy, what
areyou doing?

287
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,100
Doctor:
No one will hurtyou.

288
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,400
(screaming)

289
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,600
Doctor:
Get an orderly!

290
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,800
Get an orderly!
Nobody's going to hurtyou.

291
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,700
(screaming)

292
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,300
Stop it!

293
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,900
lt's all right.

294
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,900
Nurse:
Honey, you're going to be fine.

295
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Calm down.

296
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,800
You know thatyou will
be all right.

297
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,600
Billy said he was sorry

298
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,400
he didn't get
to say good-bye.

299
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,400
How did you know she
would have the marks?

300
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,000
l don't know.
Lucky guess?

301
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,000
Damn it, Mulder,
cut the crap.

302
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,100
What is going on here?

303
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,400
What doyou know
about those marks?

304
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,000
l don't thinkyou're ready
forwhat l think.

305
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,000
l'm here
to solve this case.

306
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,400
l want the truth.

307
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,700
l think those kids
have been abducted.

308
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,400
Bywho?

309
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,000
Bywhat.

310
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,800
You don't
really believe that.

311
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,900
Doyou have
a better explanation?

312
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,900
l'll buy that girl is suffering

313
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,700
some kind
ofpronounced psychosis.

314
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,700
Whether it's organic
or the result ofthose marks

315
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,600
l can't say

316
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,700
but to say that they've been riding
around in fying saucers--

317
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,700
there is nothing
to support that.

318
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,600
Nothing scientific, you mean.

319
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,400
There has got to be
an explanation.

320
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,800
You've got fourvictims--

321
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,100
all ofthem died
in or near the woods.

322
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,000
They found Karen Swenson's body
in the forest in her pajamas

323
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,600
ten miles from her house.

324
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,600
How did she get there?

325
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,300
What were those kids doing
out there in the forest?

326
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,900
(mechanicalhumming)

327
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,900
Mulder?

328
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:39,100
(mechanicalhum increasing)

329
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,600
Mulder, is thatyou?

330
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,200
Mulder?

331
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,300
Special Agent Dana Scully,
F.B.l. Dropyourweapon.

332
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,900
l'm with
the County Sheriffs Department.

333
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,900
You're trespassing
on private property here.

334
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,400
We are conducting

335
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,900
an investigation.

336
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,800
Get in your car and leave

337
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,400
or l'll have to arrestyou.

338
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,100
l don't care whoyou are.

339
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,100
This is a crime scene.

340
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,100
Did you hearwhat l said?

341
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,700
You are on private property
without legal permission.

342
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,100
Now, l'm only going to say it
one more time.

343
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,700
Get in your car
and leave!

344
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,100
What's he doing out here
all by himself?

345
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,900
Maybe it has something
to do with this.

346
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,300
What doyou think it is?

347
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,200
l don't know.

348
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,400
ls it a campfire?

349
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,600
lt was all over the ground.

350
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,800
l think something's
going on out here.

351
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,100
Some kind

352
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,300
ofa sacrifice, maybe.

353
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,500
What ifthese kids
are involved

354
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,000
in some kind
ofa cult

355
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,600
and that man knows
something about it?

356
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,300
l want to come back here.

357
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,200
You okay, Mulder?

358
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,100
Yeah. l'm just, uh...

359
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,600
What areyou looking for?

360
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,400
What happened?

361
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,900
We lost power.

362
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,500
Brakes, steering, everything.

363
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
We lost nine minutes.

364
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,100
Whoo!

365
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,600
We lost what?

366
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,900
Nine minutes!

367
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,300
l looked at mywatch
just before the fash

368
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,700
and it was 9:03.

369
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,000
ltjust turned 9:1 3.

370
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,000
Look.

371
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,400
Look!

372
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,600
Oh, yes!

373
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,200
Abductees.

374
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,900
People that have made
U.F.O. sightings.

375
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,700
They've reported
unexplained time loss.

376
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Come on.

377
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,000
Gone!

378
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,200
just like that.

379
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,400
No, wait a minute.

380
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,100
You're saying that...
that time disappeared.

381
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,900
Time can'tjust disappear.

382
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,100
lt's a universal
invariant.

383
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,600
(engine starts)

384
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,300
Not in this zip code.

385
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,600
Great.

386
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,400
Hi.

387
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,200
l wantyou to look at something.

388
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,900
Come on in.

389
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,500
What are they?

390
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Mulder, what are they?!

391
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,000
Mosquito bites.

392
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,400
Areyou sure?

393
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,800
Yeah. l got eaten up
a lot myselfout there.

394
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,800
You okay?

395
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,700
Yes.

396
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,900
You're shaking.

397
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,700
l need to sit down.

398
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,500
Takeyour time.

399
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,200
l was 1 2
when it happened.

400
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,700
My sisterwas eight.

401
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,500
Shejust disappeared
out ofher bed one night.

402
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,300
just gone. Vanished.

403
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,200
No note, no phone calls,
no evidence ofanything.

404
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,400
You never found her.

405
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,400
lt tore the family apart.

406
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,800
No one would talk about it.

407
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,100
There were no facts
to confront

408
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,000
nothing to offer
any hope.

409
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,600
What did you do?

410
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,400
Eventually, l went off
to school in England.

411
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,700
l came back,
got recruited by the Bureau.

412
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,000
Seems l had
a natural aptitude

413
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,100
for applying behavioral
models to criminal cases.

414
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,700
My success allowed me
a certain freedom

415
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,700
to pursue my own interests

416
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,700
and that's when l came across
the X-Files.

417
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,900
By accident?

418
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,200
At first, it looked

419
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,400
like a garbage dump

420
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,800
for U.F.O. sightings,
alien abduction reports.

421
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,400
The kind ofstuffthat most people
laugh at as being ridiculous.

422
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,000
But l was fascinated.

423
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,500
l read all the cases l could
get my hands on. Hundreds ofthem.

424
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,100
l read everything l could
about paranormal phenomenon

425
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,100
about the occult and...

426
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,800
What?

427
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,900
There's classified
government information

428
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,600
l've been trying to access

429
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,400
but someone has been blocking
my attempts to get at it.

430
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,800
Who? l don't understand.

431
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,000
Someone at a higher level
ofpower.

432
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,600
The only reason

433
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,800
l've been allowed to continue
is because l've made

434
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,200
connections in Congress.

435
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,600
They're afraid ofwhat?

436
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,700
Thatyou'll leak
this information?

437
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,500
You're part ofthat agenda,
you know that.

438
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,200
l'm not a part ofany agenda.

439
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,100
You've got to trust me.

440
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,900
l'm herejust likeyou--
to solve this.

441
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,200
l'm telling you this, Scully,
becauseyou need to know

442
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,500
because ofwhatyou've seen.

443
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,500
ln my research l've worked
very closelywith a man

444
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,000
named Dr. Heinz Werber.

445
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,600
He's taken me
through deep hypnosis.

446
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,800
l've been able to go
into my own repressed memories

447
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,400
to the night
my sister disappeared.

448
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,700
l can recall
a bright light outside

449
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,700
and a presence in the room.

450
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,700
l was paralyzed

451
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,800
unable to respond
to my sister's calls for help.

452
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,900
Listen to me, Scully.

453
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,600
This thing exists.

454
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,000
How doyou know?

455
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,800
The government knows about it

456
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,400
and l got to know
what they're protecting.

457
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,400
Nothing else matters to me

458
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,100
and this is as close
as l've ever gotten to it.

459
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,000
(phoneringing)

460
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,200
Hello?

461
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,400
What?

462
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,200
Who is this?

463
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,900
Who is th..?

464
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
That was some woman

465
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,100
and she said
Peggy O'Dell was dead.

466
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,000
The girl in the wheelchair?

467
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,800
Man: Yeah, l'll bring it
over in a minute.

468
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,900
What happened?

469
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,400
She ran right out
in front ofme.

470
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,700
Who areyou?

471
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,300
She was running?

472
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,400
On foot?

473
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,300
Well, that'sjust...

474
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,500
Let's go. Let's go.

475
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,500
Someone trashed the lab
and stole the body.

476
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,500
We're going back
to the motel.

477
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,500
What?!
They stole the corpse?

478
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,000
F.B.l.

479
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,700
There goes my computer.

480
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,300
Damn it!
The X rays and pictures!

481
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,800
Man: l need a couple
ofmen out here.

482
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,800
We'll need
a light safety curtain.

483
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,000
My name is Theresa Nemman.

484
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,900
You've got to protect me.

485
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Come with us.

486
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,800
This is the way it happens.

487
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,700
l don't know how
l get out there.

488
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,200
l'll just find myself
out in the woods.

489
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,700
How long has it been happening?

490
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,300
Ever since
the summerwe graduated.

491
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,900
lt's happened to my friends too.

492
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,200
That's why l need you
to protect me.

493
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,400
l'm scared l might die

494
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,600
like the others.

495
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,300
Like... Peggy did tonight.

496
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,600
Your father's
the medical examiner.

497
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,200
You were the one

498
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,300
on the phone.

499
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,600
You told me

500
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,200
Peggy O'Dell
had been killed.

501
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,300
Theresa, your father knows
about this, doesn't he?

502
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,000
About what happens?

503
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,500
Yes.

504
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,100
But he said
never to tell

505
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,000
anyone about any ofit.

506
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Why?

507
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
He wants to protect me.

508
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:05,800
He thinks he can protect me,
but l don't think he can.

509
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,600
Doyou have the marks, Theresa?

510
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,200
Yes.

511
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,700
l'm going to die, aren't l?

512
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,100
l'm going to be next.

513
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,800
No, you're not going to die.

514
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,800
Oh, God.

515
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,000
Let's go home, Theresa.

516
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,200
Theresa, come on.

517
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,600
Come on, honey.

518
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,000
l don't think
she wants to leave.

519
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,100
l don't care
whatyou think.

520
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,400
She's a sick girl.

521
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,200
Your father
wants to takeyou home.

522
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,700
He'll getyou
cleaned up.

523
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,900
Going to takeyou
whereyou'll be safe, Theresa.

524
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,900
Detective Miles and l won't
let anything happen toyou.

525
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
You're Billy Miles' father?

526
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,600
That's right,
and you stay away from that boy.

527
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,500
You got to love
this place.

528
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Every day is
like Halloween.

529
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,100
They know, Mulder.

530
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,800
They know who's responsible
for the murders.

531
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,100
They know something.

532
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,400
Dr. Nemman's
been hiding medical evidence

533
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,600
from the beginning.

534
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,600
He lied
on the autopsy reports.

535
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,200
Now we find out
about the detective.

536
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,600
Who would have reason
to trash the lab and our rooms?

537
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,200
Whywould they destroy evidence?

538
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,100
What would theywant
with that corpse?

539
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,600
l don't know.

540
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,200
Makes you wonderwhat's in
those other two graves.

541
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,700
They're both empty.

542
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,400
What is
going on here?

543
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,400
l think l know who did it.

544
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,600
l think l know
who killed Karen Swenson.

545
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,900
Who?

546
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,100
The detective?

547
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,100
The detective's son.

548
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,800
Billy Miles.

549
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,700
The boy in the hospital?

550
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,400
The vegetable?

551
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,700
Billy Miles?

552
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,000
A boy in a coma
for the last fouryears

553
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,200
dug up these graves?

554
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Peggy O'Dell was bound
to a wheelchair

555
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,100
but ran in front
ofthat truck.

556
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,500
l'm not making this up.

557
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,700
lt fits the profile
ofalien abduction.

558
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,500
This fits a profile?

559
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,600
Peggy O'Dell
was killed at 9:00.

560
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,900
That's right around the time
we lost nine minutes.

561
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,200
Something happened
in that nine minutes.

562
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,300
Time as we know it stopped

563
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,800
and something took control over it.

564
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,800
You think l'm crazy.

565
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,600
What?

566
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,600
Peggy O'Dell's watch stopped
a couple ofminutes after nine.

567
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,200
l made a note ofit
when l saw the body.

568
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,900
The kids come to the forest
because the forest controls them

569
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,000
and the marks
are from some kind oftests

570
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,900
that's being done on them

571
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,900
and that maybe causes
some kind ofgenetic mutation

572
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
which would explain
the body that we dug up.

573
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,900
And the force summoned
Theresa Nemman's body

574
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,600
into the woods tonight.

575
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,400
Yes, but it was Billy Miles
who took her there.

576
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,500
Summoned by some alien impulse.

577
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,000
That's it.

578
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,000
Come on.

579
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,000
Let's get out ofhere.

580
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,300
Where are we going?

581
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,100
To pay a visit
to Billy Miles.

582
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,900
Nurse: Now, we could stand here
until the Second Coming

583
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,400
waiting for Billy to get
out ofthis bed.

584
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,100
lt ain't going to happen.

585
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,100
He blinks and l know about it.

586
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,100
l guess you changed
his bedpan last night.

587
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,800
Nobody else here's
going to do it.

588
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,400
You noticed
nothing unusual?

589
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,600
Doyou rememberwhat
you were doing last night

590
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,900
around 9:00?

591
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,700
Probablywatching TV.

592
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,900
Yeah.

593
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,300
Doyou remember
whatyou were watching?

594
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,900
Um, let's see...

595
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,400
You know, l don't really
rememberwhat l watched.

596
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,600
Miss...

597
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,800
What is she looking for?

598
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,400
Mulder, take a look at this.

599
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,500
You know who was taking care
of Peggy O'Dell last night?

600
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,900
Not me.

601
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,300
lt's not myward,
not my aisle ofthe produce section.

602
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,400
l do have ajob
ofmy own to do.

603
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,900
What is she doing now?

604
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,800
Thankyou
foryour time, ma'am.

605
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,800
Okay.

606
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,900
Good day.

607
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,600
That kid may have killed
Peggy O'Dell.

608
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,700
l don't believe this.

609
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,000
lt's crazy.

610
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,900
He was in the woods.

611
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,200
You're sure?

612
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,900
This is the same stuff
l took a handful of

613
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,300
in the forest.

614
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Maybe we should run
a lab test...

615
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,000
We lost the original sample
in the fire.

616
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,300
l wantyou to understand
what it is you're saying.

617
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,500
You said ityourself!.

618
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,800
Yeah, butyou have
to write it down

619
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,400
in your report.

620
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,600
You're right.

621
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,600
We'll take another sample
from the forest

622
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,900
and run a comparison
before we do anything.

623
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,300
The detective's here.

624
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,100
What doyou think?

625
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,500
(girlscreams)

626
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,500
(groans)

627
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,700
You wouldn't listen to me.

628
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,700
l told you to stay out ofthis.

629
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,400
(girlscreaming)

630
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,300
Hold it.
Hold it right there!

631
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,800
You got
no business out here.

632
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,900
There were screams.

633
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Down on the ground.

634
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,100
Now!

635
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,000
You know it's Billy.

636
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,800
You've known it
all along.

637
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,000
l said down on the ground.

638
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,000
How long areyou going
to let it happen?

639
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,200
He's going to kill her.

640
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,000
Billy!

641
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,400
No!

642
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,700
Let her go.

643
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,700
Leave her alone.

644
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,200
(gunshot)

645
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,600
(mechanicalrattling)

646
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,200
Dad?

647
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,200
Billy.

648
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,400
Oh, God.

649
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,300
Scully.

650
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,700
Scully!

651
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,700
Mulder, what happened?

652
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,800
There was a light.

653
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,800
lt was incredible.

654
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:02,200
lfyou can hear me,
raiseyour right hand.

655
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,600
Tell me about
the light, Billy.

656
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,100
When did you first
see the light?

657
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,600
ln the forest.

658
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,800
We were all in the forest
having a party.

659
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,100
All my friends.

660
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,300
We were celebrating.

661
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,600
What wereyou celebrating?

662
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,600
Graduation.

663
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,200
And then
the light came.

664
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,500
lt took me away
to the testing place.

665
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:41,100
Theywould tell me
to gather the others

666
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,600
so that they could do tests.

667
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:48,500
They put something in my head.

668
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,400
Here.

669
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,300
Billy:
l would wait for their orders.

670
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,600
Man:
Billy, who gave the orders?

671
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:04,500
Billy: The light.
They said it would be okay.

672
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,500
No one would know.
But the test didn't work.

673
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,600
Theywanted everything
destroyed.

674
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,900
They said theywere leaving.

675
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
l'm afraid.

676
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,200
l'm afraid
they're coming back.

677
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,400
Don't be afraid, Billy.

678
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,100
(indistinct whispers)

679
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,400
What we'vejust witnessed

680
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,100
what we've read
in your field reports

681
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,500
the scientific basis
and credibility

682
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,600
just seem wholly insupportable.

683
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,200
You're aware ofthat?

684
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,600
Yes, sir.

685
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,300
My reports
are personal and subjective.

686
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,700
l haven't gone so far as to draw
any conclusion about what l've seen.

687
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:04,000
Or haven't seen,
as seems to be the case.

688
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,700
This, uh... time loss

689
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,700
you did or did not
experience it?

690
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,600
l can't substantiate it, no.

691
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,900
What exactly can you
substantiate?

692
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,400
l see no evidence

693
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,000
thatjustifies
these investigations.

694
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,300
There were, ofcourse,
crimes committed.

695
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,700
Yes, but how doyou prosecute
a case like this?

696
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,700
With testimony given
under hypnosis

697
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,600
from a boywho claims
he was given orders

698
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,100
from some alien force

699
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,000
through an implant

700
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,400
in his nose.

701
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,000
You have no physical evidence.

702
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,800
This is the object

703
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,500
described by Billy Miles

704
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,800
as a communication device.

705
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,800
l removed it

706
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,600
from the exhumed body.

707
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,700
l kept it in my pocket.

708
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,700
lt was the only evidence
not destroyed in the fire.

709
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,200
l ran a lab test on it.

710
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,200
The material could not be
identified.

711
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,300
Agent Mulder--
what are his thoughts?

712
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,400
Agent Mulder believes
we are not alone.

713
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,400
Thankyou, Agent Scully.

714
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,200
That will be all.

715
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,900
(phoneringing)

716
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,200
Hello.

717
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,600
Mulder: Scully, it's me.
l haven't been able to sleep.

718
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:08,100
l talked to the D.A.'s Office
in Raymond County, Oregon.

719
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,000
There's no case file
on Billy Miles.

720
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,100
The paperworkwe filed
is gone.

721
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,800
We need to talk, Scully.

722
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,400
Y-Yes.

723
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,400
Tomorrow.
