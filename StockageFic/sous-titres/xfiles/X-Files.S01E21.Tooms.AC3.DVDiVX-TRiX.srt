(Snapping And Cracking)

5
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:54,626
Eugene?

6
00:01:54,694 --> 00:01:57,254
Eugene, it's Dr. Monte.

7
00:02:03,303 --> 00:02:05,794
Eugene, areyou asleep?

8
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:11,209
- No.
- I was on myway out

9
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:14,270
and I wanted
to see howyou were feeling.

10
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:16,975
Fine.

11
00:02:18,718 --> 00:02:22,415
Good.
You nervous about tomorrow?

12
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:26,220
Don't be.

13
00:02:26,293 --> 00:02:28,591
I knowyou think
theywon't letyou out

14
00:02:28,662 --> 00:02:31,529
so I snuck a peek
at the reports ofthe doctors

15
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,692
that will testify
atyour review tomorrow

16
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:38,101
and they concurwith my opinion that
you're ready to be released from here

17
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:41,436
and rejoin the community.

18
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,475
So...

19
00:02:47,013 --> 00:02:49,345
why don't we get some sleep
and relax

20
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,976
and I'll seeyou tomorrow
at the review, okay?

21
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:02,093
Let'sjust keep
our fingers crossed.

22
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:13,966
Agent Scully.

23
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:17,834
We have reviewed your reports,
and frankly, we are quite displeased.

24
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:20,930
Irregular procedure,
untenable evidence

25
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:25,273
inconclusive findings
aggravated byvague opinion.

26
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:29,213
But, sir, the very nature
ofthe X-files cases

27
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:32,479
often precludes
orthodox investigation.

28
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:36,420
Areyou suggesting the Bureau adopt
separate standards foryou and Mulder?

29
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:41,290
- No, sir.
- You suggesting Mulder obstructs
you from proper procedure?

30
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:42,953
No, sir. Ifanything,
I'm suggesting

31
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:47,329
that these cases be reviewed
with... an open mind.

32
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,995
Maybeyour mind
has become too open.

33
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:54,632
On X-files cases investigated by
Agent Mulder and myselfto date

34
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,506
we have a conviction
or case solution of75%.

35
00:04:57,577 --> 00:04:59,875
That's well above
current Bureau standard.

36
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:01,971
And that is
your only saving grace.

37
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,112
May I ask, sir,
what moreyou require?

38
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:12,824
What I require

39
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:16,191
is increased frequency
ofreports

40
00:05:16,262 --> 00:05:18,628
conventional investigation.

41
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:21,667
In short, Agent Scully,
it is your responsibility

42
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:24,203
to see that these cases
are by the book.

43
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,738
I understand. However...

44
00:05:29,275 --> 00:05:31,937
conventional investigation
ofthese cases

45
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:35,413
may decrease rate ofsuccess.

46
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:45,424
(Gavel Pounding)

47
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:47,084
judge:
By order ofthe State of Maryland

48
00:05:47,193 --> 00:05:50,390
the Court shall review
the psychological status

49
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,899
of Eugene VictorTooms.

50
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:58,233
We'll begin with the court-appointed
expert witnesses.

51
00:05:58,304 --> 00:06:03,173
Court calls
Dr. Pamela Karetzky.

52
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:09,914
I performed several
diagnostic procedures on Mr. Tooms

53
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:14,511
in order to determine any
organic physiological dysfunction--

54
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:18,751
an electroencephalogram,
chromosomal analysis

55
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:20,951
a computerized axial tomograph.

56
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:22,995
All ofthese were negative.

57
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:24,963
" Mr. Tooms
had recently lost hisjob.

58
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:30,435
" Parenthesis: Baltimore animal
regulation/dog catcher.
Close parenthesis.

59
00:06:30,503 --> 00:06:33,700
"Aggravated by a false arrest
incident with the F.B.I.,

60
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:36,003
"his assault on Agent Scullywas

61
00:06:36,076 --> 00:06:39,671
'frustration directed
at the wrong person."'

62
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:41,907
I'm reading
from a recent interview

63
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:46,213
I did with Mr. Tooms
at the Druid Hill Sanitarium.

64
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:48,379
"Question: lfyou are released

65
00:06:48,455 --> 00:06:50,389
"what is the first thing
you would do?

66
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,391
"Answer: I'd like my oldjob back.

67
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,257
"Question: Why?

68
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:57,228
"Answer: The animal shelter

69
00:06:57,297 --> 00:06:59,265
"made me feel
I was helping everyone--

70
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:02,733
people and animals."

71
00:07:02,802 --> 00:07:04,895
So, you see, what is occurring here
is that Mr. Tooms has learned

72
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:10,170
to articulate his feelings
and invest his emotional energy

73
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:13,940
towards creative
and constructive activity...

74
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:19,284
(No Audio)

75
00:07:22,822 --> 00:07:24,790
...in himself.

76
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:28,419
It is my opinion that Mr. Tooms
has had a very excellent response

77
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:31,258
to the months
oftreatment and therapy.

78
00:07:31,331 --> 00:07:33,561
I would see no reason
why he would be considered

79
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:36,966
ofany danger
to himselfor society.

80
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:41,496
Woman: ...is the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth?

81
00:07:41,574 --> 00:07:43,508
I do.

82
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:51,049
Mr. Mulder, as an expert witness
for the State of Maryland,
can you listyour qualifications?

83
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:53,984
I'm a special agent
with the F.B.I.

84
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:57,022
I worked for threeyears
at the F.B.I.'s behavioral science unit

85
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:59,182
profiling serial killers.

86
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:02,557
Your Honor, I know where
he's going with this.

87
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:05,120
May I remind the Court Mr. Tooms
was placed in psychiatric care

88
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:07,461
solely for the assault
on Agent Scully.

89
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:11,800
He has never been charged, nor has any
evidence linked him to any other crime.

90
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:14,066
judge:
Proceed... with caution.

91
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,109
Myers:
Agent Mulder, I understand

92
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:20,704
thatyou've developed
a profile on Mr. Tooms.

93
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,578
- Yes, I have.
- Please.

94
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:29,353
These murders
span nearly a century.

95
00:08:29,422 --> 00:08:33,654
1 9 homicides-- five occurring
every 30 years since 1 903

96
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,921
all in the Baltimore area.

97
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:39,465
In each case,
the liverwas extracted

98
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:42,592
and presumably eaten.

99
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:46,571
A trophywas taken from each victim,
many ofwhich were found

100
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,405
in the living quarters of Eugene Tooms
at 66 Exeter Street.

101
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:53,070
Records show that a Eugene Tooms
has resided

102
00:08:53,146 --> 00:08:55,671
at that same address
since 1 903--

103
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:59,081
the sameyear a man was murdered
in that building.

104
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:02,588
The most notable element
connecting these cases

105
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:05,180
is the undetermined
point ofentry.

106
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:09,751
Manyvictims were found
with theirwindows and doors
locked from the inside.

107
00:09:09,863 --> 00:09:14,800
These fingerprints found
at seven ofthe 1 9 crime scenes

108
00:09:14,868 --> 00:09:16,631
match Eugene VictorTooms.

109
00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:19,797
Agent Mulder,
look at his fingers.

110
00:09:19,873 --> 00:09:22,671
- Look at him. 1 00 years old?
- I contend that perhaps

111
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:25,905
through a genetic mutation
Tooms is capable ofcontorting

112
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:29,312
and elongating his body
to gain access to victims

113
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:32,283
so he may extract the livers
which provide him sustenance

114
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:34,843
for the hibernation period
of30 years.

115
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:36,821
He needs one more victim
to complete this cycle.

116
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:40,757
A preliminary exam
revealed abnormalities

117
00:09:40,827 --> 00:09:43,159
in his stride, muscles,
and axial bones.

118
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:45,789
His attorney
blocked further study.

119
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:49,198
- I askyou to place the safety...
- No further questions.

120
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:53,638
This is a rare and abnormal human
creature who should not be released.

121
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:56,869
- You may step down.
- Ifyou release Eugene Tooms,
he will kill again.

122
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:58,877
It's in his genetic makeup.

123
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:13,089
Would they have taken me more seriously
ifl wore the grey suit?

124
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:17,094
Mulder, your testimony--
you sounded--

125
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:21,064
I don't care how it sounded,
as long as it was the truth.

126
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:25,802
And where wereyou?
Your testimonywas important.

127
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:29,865
I was called into a meeting
byAssistant Director Skinner.

128
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:32,377
What did he want?

129
00:10:34,647 --> 00:10:37,013
just wanted to reel me in.

130
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:41,544
They're ready.

131
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:43,748
It is the opinion ofthis Court

132
00:10:43,856 --> 00:10:45,790
that Eugene VictorTooms

133
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:49,851
shall on this day be released
from the Druid Hill Sanitarium.

134
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:53,194
Court also attaches
these conditions:

135
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:58,101
One, that he remain in counseling
under the care of Dr. Aaron Monte--

136
00:10:58,171 --> 00:11:03,473
that he may retain hisjob at the
Baltimore Regulations Animal Shelter

137
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:07,502
and last, he take residence
in the house of Mr. and Mrs. Arlan Green

138
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,141
trained in a program to assist
patients released from Druid Hill

139
00:11:11,217 --> 00:11:13,412
in their transition to society.

140
00:11:15,188 --> 00:11:17,122
Mr. Tooms?

141
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:21,426
Doyou understand
and accept these conditions?

142
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:23,325
Yes, Your Honor.

143
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:26,729
Verywell. You're free to go.

144
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:31,134
I'm not taking
my eyes offhim.

145
00:11:31,204 --> 00:11:34,605
He'll kill again first chance he can,
but he won't kill the old couple.

146
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:39,270
Tooms didn't remain a secret
for 1 00 years by not being careful.

147
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:42,576
Think ofhim as an animal. He kills
out ofnecessity or self-defense.

148
00:11:42,648 --> 00:11:44,775
Ifhe makes an attempt,
I'll be there.

149
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:46,910
I'll keep surveillance with you.

150
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:49,216
Ifhe can't be tied
to recent evidence

151
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:51,779
go to the earlier murders
to prove it was him.

152
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:53,826
That was 30 or 60 years ago.

153
00:11:53,926 --> 00:11:55,860
There's no statute oflimitation
on murder.

154
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:57,862
That's going to entail

155
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,600
unorthodox methods
ofinvestigation.

156
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:03,861
Ifyou're resistant
becauseyou don't believe

157
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:06,530
I'll respect that,
but ifyou're resistant

158
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:09,336
because ofbureaucratic pressure,
they've not only reeled you in

159
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:11,910
they've skinned you.

160
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,980
(Door Opening)

161
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:26,681
Arlan:
I hopeyou'll be comfortable, Eugene.

162
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,091
The room in
the back is small

163
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:32,962
but I'm sureyou'll
be able to squeeze in.

164
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:35,159
Tooms:
I'm sure.

165
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,742
(Growling And Snarling)

166
00:13:56,816 --> 00:13:59,478
Excuse me.

167
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:01,452
Could you help me find my dog?

168
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:05,389
He's a Norwegian elkhound.

169
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,052
His name is Heinrich.

170
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,357
I use him to hunt moose.

171
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,051
IfTooms gets away now

172
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:35,553
then the next time
he takes a life

173
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:37,486
you'll be nearly my age.

174
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:42,654
Detective Briggs,
you helped us so much before.

175
00:14:42,728 --> 00:14:46,664
Now we have to prove
that Tooms was involved

176
00:14:46,732 --> 00:14:49,394
in the killings
you investigated 30 years ago.

177
00:14:49,468 --> 00:14:53,370
You've lived with this case
halfyour life.

178
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,567
There must be something.

179
00:14:56,676 --> 00:14:59,076
Maybe a connection
between the victims.

180
00:14:59,145 --> 00:15:01,511
Now, I know that we've seen
all ofthe evidence

181
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:04,550
but is there anything,
anything at all

182
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:07,415
amongst the evidence
that does not fit?

183
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:10,148
There was something

184
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:13,317
that never did sit
quite right with me.

185
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:17,123
All ofthe victims
that I investigated in '63

186
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:20,757
were found at the crime scene,
liver extracted.

187
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,664
All five.

188
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:25,295
As were the four
most recent murders.

189
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:28,033
When I was a sheriff

190
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,577
during the Powhatan Mills
killings of 1 933

191
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:36,444
only four ofthe victims
were found at the crime scene.

192
00:15:36,515 --> 00:15:39,484
However,
there was a fifth person

193
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:41,850
who was missing
and never found

194
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:44,446
but this--

195
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:47,458
this was discovered
at the Ruxton Chemical Plant

196
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:49,790
when it was under construction.

197
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:52,387
But it doesn't belong
to the othervictims.

198
00:15:52,465 --> 00:15:56,367
That doesn't prove it belongs
to a person murdered byTooms.

199
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:59,029
I'm positive
Tooms hid this one victim

200
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:02,700
because something about the body
could prove he was the killer.

201
00:16:02,808 --> 00:16:05,368
- What makes you positive?
- A hunch.

202
00:16:05,478 --> 00:16:07,503
An old-fashioned hunch.

203
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:10,582
You've got to trust
your instincts.

204
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:13,811
And what does your instinct say

205
00:16:13,886 --> 00:16:16,184
about where Tooms
buried the body?

206
00:16:16,255 --> 00:16:19,224
In the cement where
they poured the foundation

Tells you
where the body is.

212
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:42,445
Well, it signals ifsomething
inordinate is present.

An experienced operator
attempts to differentiate

214
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:49,651
ifthe signal is a body
or a stone or a hole in the ground.

215
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:52,350
- Differentiate.
- Mm-hmm.

00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:55,155
You mean he guesses.

00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:57,991
Well, it's an educated guess.

Someone opened mywindow.

244
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:38,322
I suspect theyear ofdeath
to be in the mid-1 930s.

Can you determine
cause ofdeath?

251
00:24:58,343 --> 00:25:01,073
My instinct says
that burial in cement is murder.

252
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:03,011
Uh, no. At the moment

253
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:05,174
I have found
no definite proofofmurder.

254

There are gnawing marks
near the ribs.

255
00:25:07,786 --> 00:25:09,981
However, I suspect that's
the result ofrodent activity

256

prior to the body
being set in the cement.

257
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:15,758
We need to see much more ofthe remains
to determine cause ofdeath.

As you know, it's a slow,
but necessary process.

I did try
a little something.

260
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:25,367
It's a little premature
ifwe're going by the book.

261
00:25:25,437 --> 00:25:27,405
Well, we'll keep it

but that skeleton
was that person.

It's not enough.
It doesn't tie it to Tooms.

282
00:26:41,213 --> 00:26:43,738
Mulder, you know
that proper surveillance

283
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:47,842
requires two pairs ofagents-- one pair
relieving the other after 1 2 hours.

and you're going to get hurt.

00:26:59,231 --> 00:27:03,190
A request for other agents
to stake out Tooms would be denied.

Mr. Tooms.

328
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,964
Says it was an F.B.I. agent
named Mulder.

329
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:12,601
So would you say he's delusional
orjust schizophrenic?

330
00:32:12,677 --> 00:32:16,238
Well, it'sjust a cursory exam,
but there's nothing to indicate that.

340

The evidence is incriminating.

341

A good forensic scientist would know
there is not only a shoe print

342
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:43,228
but also an impact point
ofa foot from inside the shoe.

343
00:33:43,301 --> 00:33:48,364
An analysis ofTooms' injurywould show
that my foot was not inside the shoe.

344
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,102
Areyou suggesting
Tooms is framing you?

345
00:33:51,176 --> 00:33:55,044
- Ofcourse.
- Ifyou were engaged in an unauthorized

00:33:55,113 --> 00:33:56,705
surveillance ofTooms

347
00:33:56,781 --> 00:33:59,682
how could he gain access
toyour shoe withoutyou seeing him?

348
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:01,651
Sir? I was engaged

349
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,486
in the unauthorized surveillance
as well

350
00:34:05,557 --> 00:34:09,516
and Agent Mulder
was orienting me

351
00:34:09,627 --> 00:34:13,427
on the situation at the time
Tooms was admitted into the hospital.

352
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:17,127
Agent Mulder could not have done it
because he was with me.

353
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:20,864
Agent Scully, you wouldn't
be lying to me, would you?

354
00:34:20,939 --> 00:34:22,873
Sir, I would expectyou

355
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:26,138
to place the same trust
in me as I do in you.

356
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:29,977
Agent Scully, may I have a word
with Agent Mulder, please?

357
00:34:42,026 --> 00:34:43,926
Fox...

358
00:34:46,631 --> 00:34:49,725
you are one ofthe finest,
most unique agents

359
00:34:49,834 --> 00:34:53,292
in the nearly 60-year history
ofthis institution.

360
00:34:53,405 --> 00:34:56,169
I mean, we were talking aboutyou
when you were in the academy.

361
00:34:56,241 --> 00:35:00,701
Now, most ofus feel thatyour talents
are wasted on the X-files

362
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:05,409
but we respect thatyou're
deeply invested in those areas.

363
00:35:05,483 --> 00:35:08,543
But ifthese cases
are creating such stress

364
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,248
as to cause not onlyyou
to act inappropriately

365
00:35:11,322 --> 00:35:13,415
but those agents
close toyou as well

366
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:18,019
then may I adviseyou
to step away... for a while?

367
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:21,997
Clearyour head,
take an extended vacation.

368
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:24,159
That's a good idea.

369
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:27,067
Thanks foryour concern.

370
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:45,420
You're forbidden
to go near Eugene Tooms.

371
00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:51,060
Mulder...

372
00:35:51,162 --> 00:35:54,063
this was close.

373
00:35:54,132 --> 00:35:58,694
Any closer and a thousand friends at
the capitol won't be able to helpyou.

374
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,208
Scully:
These are Eugene Tooms' dental X rays

375
00:36:05,276 --> 00:36:09,076
obtained from
the Druid Hills Sanitarium.

376
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:11,308
Your sandwich
gave me an idea.

377
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:13,714
Dr. Plith mentioned
he found gnawing

378
00:36:13,785 --> 00:36:17,312
on the rib cage
near the location ofthe liver.

379
00:36:17,422 --> 00:36:22,086
Further excavation revealed
more pronounced bite marks--

380
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:24,923
human teeth marks.

381
00:36:24,996 --> 00:36:27,556
Tooms will nevervoluntarily submit
to a dental cast.

382
00:36:27,632 --> 00:36:31,090
This software can create
an exact three-dimensional model

383
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:34,570
ofTooms' mouth
from the dental radiograph.

384
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,248
We've also mapped out
the bite marks

385
00:36:44,315 --> 00:36:46,875
on the skeleton's rib,
there.

386
00:36:52,123 --> 00:36:54,591
They match.

387
00:37:04,435 --> 00:37:06,699
(Knocking)

388
00:37:09,807 --> 00:37:12,469
- Eugene, Dr. Monte.
- Hi, Eugene.

389
00:37:12,544 --> 00:37:14,842
I wanted to see
how everything was going.

390
00:37:14,913 --> 00:37:17,143
Arlan: Susan and I
are going out for the evening.

391
00:37:17,215 --> 00:37:19,479
Thanks.

392
00:37:21,486 --> 00:37:24,080
Great place.
Wonderful place.

393
00:37:24,155 --> 00:37:26,123
How areyou feeling?

394
00:37:44,509 --> 00:37:46,602
Why the newspapers strips,
Eugene?

395
00:37:46,678 --> 00:37:50,375
Areyou making
some paper-mache?

396
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:53,679
- Yes.
- That's terrific.

397
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:57,118
Wonderful. I had no idea
you were interested in art.

398
00:37:59,657 --> 00:38:02,125
I like art.

399
00:38:02,226 --> 00:38:05,491
I do too,
and I'm very proud ofyou.

400
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:10,227
You know, art can provide a window
toyour thoughts and your feelings.

401
00:38:10,301 --> 00:38:12,633
What areyou doing,
Eugene?

402
00:38:12,704 --> 00:38:15,798
Eugene, areyou all right?

403
00:38:19,644 --> 00:38:21,908
(Dr. Monte Screaming)

404
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:08,081
That makes five.

405
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:20,160
- He's building his nest.
A 30-year hibernation.
- Where would he go?

406
00:39:20,238 --> 00:39:23,071
Where he's gone for the last 90 years:
66 Exeter Street.

407
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:28,101
- No, they tore down that
apartment building he lived in.
- What's there now?

408
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:34,474
Mulder:
Thanks.

409
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:42,419
He's got to be here.

410
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:45,052
Ifhe is drawn to this location
for some reason

411
00:39:45,163 --> 00:39:49,759
maybe this nest is in the approximate
location ofthe previous nest.

412
00:39:53,805 --> 00:39:56,069
This is the area.

413
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,507
There's a storage facility
on the second foor.

414
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:16,718
What?

415
00:40:27,872 --> 00:40:30,136
Scully:
There's only room for one.

416
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:34,337
You can get
the next mutant.

417
00:41:35,273 --> 00:41:37,503
Mulder!

418
00:42:18,115 --> 00:42:20,640
(Growling)

419
00:42:24,188 --> 00:42:25,815
Mulder!

420
00:42:25,923 --> 00:42:28,391
(Growling)

421
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,642
Mulder!
Here. Take my hand!

422
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:52,482
Come on.
You can reach it! Mulder!

423
00:42:53,551 --> 00:42:56,145
Mulder, what's happening?

424
00:42:59,824 --> 00:43:01,621
Quick!

425
00:43:07,932 --> 00:43:10,867
(Growling)

426
00:43:14,872 --> 00:43:17,864
(Screaming)

427
00:43:42,266 --> 00:43:44,757
You read this report?

428
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:51,708
Doyou believe them?

429
00:43:54,178 --> 00:43:56,112
Ofcourse I do.

430
00:44:09,026 --> 00:44:11,017
Okay. Let's go.

431
00:44:11,128 --> 00:44:14,495
It's amazing how
things change, isn't it?

432
00:44:14,565 --> 00:44:17,193
The caterpillar?

433
00:44:17,268 --> 00:44:21,932
No. A change for us.
It's coming.

434
00:44:22,006 --> 00:44:24,167
How doyou know?

435
00:44:26,043 --> 00:44:28,341
A hunch.
