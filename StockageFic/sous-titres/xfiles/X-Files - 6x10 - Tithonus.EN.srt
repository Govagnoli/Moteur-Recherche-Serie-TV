to get the shot.

329
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,465
I don't take those people.
He does.

330
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,975
Who's he?

331
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:15,845
That's him.
He's the one who takes them.

332
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:19,145
You're saying that this is
a photograph of Death itself?

333
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:22,118
It's a glimpse.
Just a glimpse.

334
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,747
It's closer than I've gotten in--

335
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:27,984
Well, I can't even
count the years.

336
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:31,391
And this is the shot
that you spoke of. This is...

337
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:35,359
- what you try and get.
- Mm-hmm.

338
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:44,539
Mr. Fellig, I know that you know more
about photography than I do,

339
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:49,205
but this is just a lens flare.

340
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,011
You're right. I do know more
about photography than you do.

341
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,448
Okay, I mean--

342
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:07,664
For the sake of argument,
why bother?

343
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:11,566
I mean, why--
Why take a picture of Death?

344
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:16,733
So I can look into his face...
so I can die.

345
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:21,640
Pills don't work.

346
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:25,038
Razors, gas, bridges--

347
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:28,118
I can't tell you how many
bridges I've jumped off of.

348
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,416
All I get is wet.

349
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,859
I got left behind.

350
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,588
I don't want
to be here anymore.

351
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,688
I can't even remember
a time when I did.

352
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,892
Uh--

353
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:45,527
This is--

354
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:48,936
This is all I know to do.

355
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,643
You know I don't believe you.

356
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,702
Yes, you do.

357
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,881
That's why you're here.

358
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:25,473
How is it you know
when people are about to die?

359
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,811
Oh.

360
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:32,815
You chase it long enough,
you pick it up.

361
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,529
Excuse me.

362
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:05,712
- Mulder. Hi.
- Mulder, it's me.

363
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:10,516
Those other two names that you said
that Fellig went by-- Strand and Rice?

364
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:13,489
Yeah. Henry Strand
and L.H. Rice.

365
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,083
What about Louis Brady?

366
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:21,359
Uh, no, but there's a,
there's like a big gap before 1 939.

367
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:24,924
<i>[ Scully ]</i>
<i>Will you check it out for me?</i>

368
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,666
<i>I'm sticking here</i>
<i>to make sure he doesn't bolt.</i>

369
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,674
<i>Louis Brady, Mulder.</i>

370
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:33,210
Tell me what you find out.

371
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,127
Mr. Fellig?

372
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:59,659
Oops. Excuse me. I have film out.
Hold on a second.

373
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:55,389
<i>[ Cell Phone Ringing ]</i>

374
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,587
- Ritter.
- Agent Ritter, it's Agent Mulder.

375
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:01,962
- Is Agent Scully with you?
- No, she's not, nor do I
seem to able to find her.

376
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,763
Me neither, and D.C. Cellular
says her phone is turned off.

377
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,771
- What can I do for you, Agent?
- Well, you can find her for me.

378
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,275
Listen, Agent Mulder,
I'm on my way to arrest Alfred Fellig.

379
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,276
Good, because
that's where I think she is.

380
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,608
And you were right.
Fellig is a murderer.

381
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:19,615
Under the name of Louis Brady,
he suffocated two patients
in a Connecticut hospital.

382
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:21,651
He says he meant
to catch up with Death.

383
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,620
One year into his prison sentence,
he walked off a work detail.

384
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,884
The manhunt
never officially ceased.

385
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,153
- When was this?
- 1 929.

386
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,127
Whoa, whoa, whoa. When?

387
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:33,755
Look, Ritter, don't sweat the math.
It's him.

388
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,856
Just get there
and find Agent Scully.

389
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,867
All right.
I'm on it.

390
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,401
You know, most people
want to live forever.

391
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,843
Most people are idiots.

392
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:50,846
Which is
one of the reasons I don't.

393
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,906
I think you're wrong.

394
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,277
How can you have
too much life?

395
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,721
There's too much to learn,
to experience.

396
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:07,059
Seventy-five years is enough.

397
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:09,929
Take my word for it.

398
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,935
You live forever,
sooner or later...

399
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,631
you start to think about
the big thing you're missing...

400
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:18,664
and that everybody else gets
to find out about but you.

401
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:21,303
What about love?

402
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,404
What, does that last forever?

403
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:31,054
Forty years ago,
I drove down to the city hall,

404
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,214
down to the Hall of Records.

405
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:38,456
Record archives, whatever they call it.
I wanted to look up my wife.

406
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,929
It...

407
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:44,695
bothered me I couldn't
remember her name.

408
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:48,896
Love lasts...

409
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:51,203
seventy-five years,
if you're lucky.

410
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,106
<i>You don't want to be around</i>
<i>when it's gone.</i>

411
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,420
Count your blessings.

412
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,312
<i>Why are you this way?</i>

413
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:34,549
I mean, if this is true,

414
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,588
give me something
in the way of proof.

415
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:40,522
Help me find some science
that I can hang this on.

416
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,616
It has nothing to do
with science.

417
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:47,787
- Someone took my place.
- Took your place?

418
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:51,959
I don't know her name.

419
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,970
I don't think
I ever knew it.

420
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:58,099
I had yellow fever
way the hell back then...

421
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:00,643
when it killed
half of New York.

422
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:07,247
Washington Square Park
was a common grave,
they had so many bodies.

423
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:10,378
They'd bury them shallow.

424
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,718
They wrapped them
in yellow sheets,

425
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,224
and the yellow sheets
would stick up through the mud.

426
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:19,285
I was in a city-run
contagion ward.

427
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,922
I was out of my head with fever,
out of my mind,

428
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:24,695
then I saw him--
saw Death.

429
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,065
Wish I would've
had a camera then.

430
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,539
At first, I...

431
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:34,009
just saw him out of
the corner of my eye.

432
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:37,514
Then he got bolder and he started
flitting around the room,

433
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:41,711
and he'd take this person
and he'd take that person.

434
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:44,186
And I never saw his face.
I didn't want to see his face.

435
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:48,021
I figured if I saw it,
he'd take me too.

436
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,855
- But he didn't.
- No.

437
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:54,487
There was a nurse.

438
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:57,066
She did the best she could.

439
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:02,504
Back then,
medical science was--

440
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:05,133
They couldn't find their ass
with both hands. They still can't.

441
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:09,077
But she did the best she could.
She sat with me.

442
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:11,046
<i>Held my hand.</i>

443
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:15,381
I was on my deathbed,
then he came for me.

444
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,444
I didn't look at him.

445
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,684
I closed my eyes
and turned my head.

446
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:25,957
I didn't tell her not to look at him.
I wanted her to look at him.

447
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:29,226
I wanted her to look at him
instead of me.

448
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:34,236
And then I came to
and the fever broke.

449
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:39,303
They were carrying her out
wrapped up in a yellow sheet.

450
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:45,409
Since that time, I realized you got
to be careful what you wish for.

451
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:48,281
I missed my chance.

452
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:54,246
- You're very lucky, you know that?
- What do you mean?

453
00:39:58,095 --> 00:40:00,757
Wait a minute.

454
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:06,860
Say what's on your mind.
You mean lucky like the others?

455
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,871
You want me to believe
that I'm about to die?

456
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:11,806
I just want to take the picture.

457
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:14,936
You took my picture.
You took my picture last night.
Is this why?

458
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,606
- No. That was different.
- I'm not gonna die!

00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:28,283
There is nothing
to be done for it.

00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,697
You took my phone. Why?

463
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,503
- Please,just give me a chance.
- What don't you want me to know?

464
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:49,535

and you should just make your peace.
