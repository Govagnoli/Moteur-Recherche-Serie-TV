00:41:43,766 --> 00:41:47,486
I'M NOT DEAD.
SHE WANTS YOU TO SHOOT ME.

494
00:41:47,486 --> 00:41:50,689
SHE KNOWS YOU'LL NEVER
FORGIVE YOURSELF.

495
00:41:50,689 --> 00:41:52,975
- SHUT UP !  SHUT UP !
- LISTEN TO ME !

496
00:41:52,975 --> 00:41:57,479
YOUR MOTHER IS TINA.
 YOUR SISTER IS SAMANTHA.

497
00:41:57,479 --> 00:42:00,766
SHUT UP !
MODELL WARNED YOU.

498
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:03,535
DON'T PLAY HER GAME.

499
00:42:20,002 --> 00:42:21,804
MULDER.

500
00:42:37,419 --> 00:42:41,907
YOU THINK YOU CAN HOLD ME ?

501
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:53,168
[ Phone Dialing ]

502
00:42:55,404 --> 00:42:58,407
YES, I'D LIKE AN AMBULANCE
AT 214 CHANNEL AVENUE.

503
00:43:03,662 --> 00:43:05,664
LINDA BOWMAN.

504
00:43:05,664 --> 00:43:09,084
SHE HAS AN ADVANCED
TEMPORAL LOBE TUMOR,
JUST LIKE MODELL'S.

505
00:43:09,084 --> 00:43:10,919
IT SEEMS TO RUN
IN THE FAMILY.

506
00:43:12,771 --> 00:43:16,809
- SHE AND MODELL ARE RELATED ?
- FRATERNAL TWINS.

507
00:43:16,809 --> 00:43:19,862
[ Sighs ]
HE MEANT TO PROTECT
HIS SISTER.

508
00:43:19,862 --> 00:43:23,749
APPARENTLY, SHE ONLY FOUND OUT
ABOUT HIS EXISTENCE
SIX MONTHS AGO.

509
00:43:23,749 --> 00:43:26,385
THEY WERE SEPARATED WHEN
 THEY WERE TWO WEEKS OLD.

510
00:43:26,385 --> 00:43:29,171
RAISED APART.

511
00:43:29,171 --> 00:43:32,174
HER FOXHUNT--

512
00:43:32,174 --> 00:43:36,929
I'M GUESSING SHE WANTED
REVENGE FOR WHAT SHE FEELS
WE DID TO HER BROTHER.

513
00:43:38,564 --> 00:43:40,432
ANYTHING YOU WANT
TO ADD TO THAT ?

514
00:43:42,401 --> 00:43:44,286
I THINK THAT COVERS IT.

515
00:43:54,062 --> 00:43:56,431
MULDER, A MOMENT, PLEASE ?

516
00:44:05,841 --> 00:44:08,343
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

517
00:44:08,844 --> 00:44:11,847
HOW'S THAT ?
NOBODY COULD'VE
FIGURED THIS OUT BUT YOU.

518
00:44:11,847 --> 00:44:13,715
YOU KNEW IT WAS LINDA BOWMAN
AND NOT MODELL.

519
00:44:13,715 --> 00:44:17,052
YOU WERE WAY AHEAD OF ME.
I ALMOST KILLED MY PARTNER.

520
00:44:18,987 --> 00:44:21,823
MULDER, DESPITE THAT,
YOU PREVAILED.

521
00:44:21,823 --> 00:44:24,243
YOU WON HER GAME.

522
00:44:29,748 --> 00:44:32,084
HOW COME I FEEL
LIKE I LOST ?

523
00:45:22,483 --> 00:45:25,053
