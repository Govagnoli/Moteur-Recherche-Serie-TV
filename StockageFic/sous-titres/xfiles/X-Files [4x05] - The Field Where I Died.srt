00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:18,022
you were assigned
to this operation...

78
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:22,460
to investigate claims of
Ephesian's paranormal abilities:
channeling, astral projection.

We believe Ephesian
is a paranoid charismatic sociopath.

80
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,859
He is obsessed
with the Book of Revelation...

81
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:32,564
and will use his knowledge
of biblical text to get anything
he wants from his followers.

82
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,837
Ephesian had six women on the verge
of suicide. You witnessed it.

83
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,401
My concern is if the temple
members are released,

84
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,937
any subsequent federal investigation
will ignite Ephesian's paranoia...

85
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:45,610
to such a degree that we won't
have another Waco on our hands;

86
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:48,914
we'll have Jones town.

87
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:53,582
I knew you were coming.

88
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:57,586
I've known
for nine centuries.

89
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:02,663
It was written in the Revelation
of Jesus Christ.

90
00:07:02,736 --> 00:07:05,330
" Behold...

91
00:07:05,405 --> 00:07:10,809
the devil shall cast some of thee
into prison that you may be tried.

92
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:14,142

a crown of life."

But that message was
to the Church at Smyrna.

96
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:25,884

your temple is the reincarnation
of the Church at Ephesia.

was unfaithful,

a crown of life ?

104
00:07:53,386 --> 00:07:56,116
There are no members of the temple
named or nick named Sidney.

you don't believe.

I'm Jim Jones or David Koresh.

I don't need you
to believe or even like me.

108
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:11,502
But just for a moment, I'd like you
to put aside your investigation...

109
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:15,268

00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:19,141

112
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:27,980
if that means me or...
this "Sidney"...

00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:30,249

[Scully] Skinner said no one else
has come up with anything.

122
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,682
As you can see, they've started
to release members of the temple.

123

under federal control though.

00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:53,636
M-My real family's here.

135
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:55,640
How long
have you lived there ?

136
00:09:57,243 --> 00:09:59,643
A year.

137
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:02,510
How long have you
been married to Ephesian ?

138
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:04,606
A year.

139
00:10:04,717 --> 00:10:07,515
Does it bother you
that he has otherwives ?

140
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:11,421
"And on that day, seven women
shall take hold of one man, saying,

141

"'We shall eat our own bread,
we shall wear our own apparel,

only let us be called by The name
to take away our reproach."'

[Scully] That's quite a faith
you have in Vernon, Melissa.

00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:28,067
I'd have a tough time
if my husband had so many
children with other women.

00:10:38,718 --> 00:10:44,588
Vernon has to wait until God
tells him when the right soul
is ready to be reincarnated.

That's why Vernon's children are
the most sacred members of the temple.

been hurting the children.

is a past life just because

00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:24,048
We found Sidney.
Voice spectrogram
confirms...

167
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:27,115
Melissa Riedal's
vocal pattern matches
the A.T.F. Sidney call.

168
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:29,388
Melissa Riedal
is not cooperating.

169
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:31,896
But there is a personality
within her that wants to.

170
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:35,456
We need a psychological
catalyst. I suggest we take
her back to the compound.

171
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:37,730
Maybe exposing her to that
environment without Ephesian present...

172
00:12:37,804 --> 00:12:43,071
will somehow enable Melissa
to talk or a personality inside her.

173
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:46,543
Agent Scully, could this be some
kind of a stall or staged diversion ?

174
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:49,274
It's my understanding
that multiple personalities are rare.

175
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:52,146
They're extremely rare. In fact,
many in the psychiatric community...

176
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:55,210
do not believe that dissociative
identity disorder exists.

177
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:58,552
What we witnessed meets the criteria
established in the D.S.M.-IV.

178
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:01,024
The presence of two or more
distinct personality states...

179
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:02,959
that recurrently
take control over behavior,

180
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:05,259
including the protector
identity, Sidney.

181
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:07,424
The inability to recall
important personal information.

182
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,434
She couldn't recall
her own home town.

183
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:11,436
Transitions from one
personality state to another...

184
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:14,940
are usually a matter of seconds and are
often caused by psychosocial stress.

185
00:13:15,007 --> 00:13:18,443
Sidney appeared when we mentioned
that children had been abused.

186
00:13:18,511 --> 00:13:22,072
- But you remain unconvinced ?
- I believe the disorder exists,

187
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:24,741
but under these circumstances,
I would have to know more.

188
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:27,684
If Melissa has multiple
personalities, would her--

189
00:13:27,753 --> 00:13:31,189
his testimony
even be admissible ?

190
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:34,249
Judicial precedents have
established that dissociative
personalities are responsible.

191
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:36,761
Yes, but we are responsible
for Melissa Riedal.

192
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:40,526
What we are responsible for is
the potential loss of 50 lives.

193
00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:45,366
Do it.

194
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:50,542
You didn't even have the courage
to tell Skinner what you really believe:

195
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,637
that Melissa Riedal is being invaded
by her past life incarnations.

196
00:13:54,747 --> 00:13:56,442
Because he wouldn't believe me.

197
00:13:56,549 --> 00:13:59,484
I don't believe that you feel
responsible for those 50 lives...

198
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:02,020
or Melissa Riedal.

199
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:04,680
You are only responsible
to yourself, Mulder.

00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,574
You may not want to talk about them
they may be so painful.

You may be afraid
to remember.

202

But to help the others...

203
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:33,949
to help the children
and to help yourself,

204
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:38,582

Why you call me that ?

it's okay to tell me.

[ Sidney] Look, leave
the kid alone. Hear me ?

218
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:56,956
She doesn't want to talk.
Right ? No way.

219
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:59,293
I'm sending her home.

220
00:16:59,398 --> 00:17:03,732
Sidney, you can all go home.
You can all be safe, if you just
tell us where they hid the guns.

221
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,158
What's wrong ?

222
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:33,356
[ Southern Accent ]
The weapons were placed in the bunker,

223
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:36,054
which they had built
the night before.

224
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:38,892
That's why they weren't
on the A.T.F. reports.

225
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:43,332
The Federals would arrive
in the morning,just before the sun.

229
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:56,242
just as they had watched their brothers
die days before on Missionary Ridge.

230
00:18:56,315 --> 00:18:58,579
We had received word...

231
00:18:58,651 --> 00:19:01,484
of General Cleburne's
retreat from the Union army.

232
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:04,921
As a nurse, I had been ordered from
Hamilton County to meet the troops,

233
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,255
but... in actuality,

234
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:10,659
I was searching for him,

235
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:14,290
knowing that he would attempt
to remain in Tennessee...

236
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,800
rather than retreat
to Dalton.

237
00:19:18,003 --> 00:19:20,130
I found him here...

amongst the others
who had been lost...

239
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:27,512
as General Thomas pushed
through the Confederate line.

240
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:34,844
The federal troops would
appear from that direction.

241
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,879
Rather than retreat any further,
they fought them,

00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:46,028

I'm arranging for a therapist trained in
hypnosis to be at the command center.

253
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:02,098
Because hypnosis is used in the
treatment of dissociative identities...

to bring forth a patient's
various personalities ?

255

She wants to talk, Scully.
It's a matter of getting it out of her.

No, it's about regressing her
to a past life.

Don't do this to her, Mulder.
This poor woman's mind,

Why can't you feel it ?

How could I know about a bunker
in a field where I've never been ?

And why is it that Vernon Ephesian is,
reported by you, a paranoid sociopath...

in Greece a hundred years ago,

514
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:39,960
so earnest, so--

515
00:43:40,031 --> 00:43:42,431
Instinct with better light
let in by death...

516
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:47,062
that life was blotted out
not so completely...

517
00:43:47,138 --> 00:43:52,474
but scattered wrecks, enough of it
to remain dim memories...

518
00:43:52,543 --> 00:43:54,738
as now...

519
00:43:54,812 --> 00:43:58,339
when seems once more...

520
00:43:58,416 --> 00:44:01,943
the goal insight again.

521
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
