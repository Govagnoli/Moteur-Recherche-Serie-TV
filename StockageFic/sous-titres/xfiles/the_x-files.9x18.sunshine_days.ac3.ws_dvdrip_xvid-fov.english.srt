is only a byproduct.

185
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,347
I'm not really sure, but...

186
00:11:38,455 --> 00:11:41,322
Look, I had
an odd experience today...

187
00:11:41,425 --> 00:11:43,120
and, uh, and it
made me think...

188
00:11:43,226 --> 00:11:44,784
to try something unusual.

189
00:11:44,895 --> 00:11:51,596
I borrowed an EEG machine
and I wired Mr. McCormick to it.

190
00:11:53,703 --> 00:11:55,227
And for the last few hours...

191
00:11:55,338 --> 00:11:57,670
he's been putting off
a faint reading.

192
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:02,674
Are you saying he's alive?

193
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:04,440
No, he's dead as a hammer.

194
00:12:04,548 --> 00:12:07,984
What I'm reading is some sort
of residual electricity...

195
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:11,612
like a, like a battery
that's draining off its charge.

196
00:12:13,857 --> 00:12:15,415
It's fascinating.

197
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:18,517
I mean, I've never seen
anything quite like it.

198
00:12:18,628 --> 00:12:19,856
But what does it mean?

199
00:12:21,465 --> 00:12:25,265
Well, if Mulder were here,
I'd imagine he'd talk about...

200
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:29,862
research linking electromagnetic
fluctuations to levitation...

201
00:12:29,973 --> 00:12:32,339

202
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:33,374

203
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:34,774
Ghosts and poltergeists?

204
00:12:34,878 --> 00:12:36,505
That's what Mulder would say?

00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,477
At the end of the day...

206
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,313
I wouldn't have any theory
that was any better...

00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:44,319

Hello, Anthony.
Are you ready to begin?

254
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:38,913
Good. Now, relax, relax
and focus.

255
00:16:39,022 --> 00:16:41,718

Too bad that wasn't on film.

264
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:16,956
The understatement
of a lifetime.

Whatever phenomena caused this...

266
00:17:19,696 --> 00:17:24,395

an electromagnetic field...

267
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,231

00:17:48,992 --> 00:17:52,189
of what was initially thought
to be poltergeist activity.

277
00:17:52,295 --> 00:17:54,229
It focused on a young boy,
Anthony Fogelman...

278
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,763
who has since changed his name.

279
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:58,629

the parapsychologist...

280
00:17:58,735 --> 00:18:00,225
who investigated it.

281

00:18:13,683 --> 00:18:15,776
Six astonishing months.

287
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:17,750
What did you learn?

288
00:18:17,854 --> 00:18:21,654
That Anthony was as bewildered
as everyone else...

289
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:24,818
but that he was responsible
for all of it.

290
00:18:24,928 --> 00:18:26,657
He was psychokinetic.

291
00:18:26,763 --> 00:18:27,752
He was the Mozart...

of psychokinesis?

296
00:18:39,108 --> 00:18:44,876
Over time, Anthony's

298
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,847
there were no manifestations
of it whatsoever.

to a judge?

303
00:19:00,263 --> 00:19:03,494
Was he an angry kid?
Was he violent?

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,694
I can't say
what he grew up to be.

He said it was

star-crossed, a danger.

bust him and I'm happy.

Well, the power...

368
00:23:29,065 --> 00:23:33,764
that this man seemingly
possesses is extraordinary.

369
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,962
It needs to be studied.

370
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:36,561

Oh, my God.

544
00:37:21,096 --> 00:37:22,358
Oliver?

545
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:26,992
Oliver, those people just now...

546
00:37:27,102 --> 00:37:29,730
Was that...

547
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:31,203
Were they...

548
00:37:33,342 --> 00:37:34,775
Why were they here?

549
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:39,937
To say good-bye.

550
00:37:40,048 --> 00:37:42,642
Why good-bye, Oliver?

551
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:49,955
Because I'm dying.

552
00:38:06,608 --> 00:38:10,009
[Rietz]
April fourth, 1970, 10:36 a.m.

553
00:38:10,112 --> 00:38:12,774
Present for this test
areJohn Rietz, speaking...

554
00:38:12,881 --> 00:38:14,781
and Anthony Fogelman,
age eight.

555
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:16,646
Hello, Anthony.

556
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,219
Are you ready to begin?

557
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,345
Any change in his condition?

558
00:38:20,455 --> 00:38:23,822
They're trying everything
they can think of.

559
00:38:23,925 --> 00:38:27,986
Experimental drugs,
plasma transfusion.

560
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,495
None of that's going to work.

561
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:30,860
Why not?

562
00:38:30,966 --> 00:38:33,366
Because they're treating
the symptoms...

563
00:38:33,468 --> 00:38:34,867
not the cause.

564
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,234
What do you have, John?

565
00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:39,102
One big question.

566
00:38:39,207 --> 00:38:42,404
Why <i>The Brady Bunch?</i>

567
00:38:42,511 --> 00:38:45,446
Seriously, you two are fans.

568
00:38:45,547 --> 00:38:47,879
Why are people still watching
a 30-year-old TV show?

569
00:38:47,983 --> 00:38:52,352
Because they're the family
everyone wishes they had.

570
00:38:52,454 --> 00:38:55,787
Loving parents,
lots of brothers and sisters...

571
00:38:55,891 --> 00:38:57,518
everybody getting along.

572
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,594
They're the perfect family.

573
00:38:59,695 --> 00:39:03,495
And since Oliver
didn't have one as a child...

574
00:39:03,598 --> 00:39:05,190
he... created one.

575
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,494
Sure, I'd buy all that...

576
00:39:06,601 --> 00:39:09,161
but in this case,
why <i>The Brady Bunch?</i>

577
00:39:09,271 --> 00:39:11,102
Why not <i>The Partridge Family?</i>

578
00:39:11,206 --> 00:39:12,730
Why not <i>Eight is Enough?</i>

579
00:39:17,946 --> 00:39:20,710
Where was Oliver when
he first saw <i>The Brady Bunch?</i>

580
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,044
He was with you, right?

581
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:25,142
He'd always insist
that we watch it together...

582
00:39:25,253 --> 00:39:26,948
every week I was there.

583
00:39:27,055 --> 00:39:28,920
And the longer
you two were together...

584
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,015
the more his
psychokinetic power faded...

585
00:39:31,126 --> 00:39:33,060
until finally it went away
completely.

586
00:39:34,563 --> 00:39:36,724
Why do you think that was?

587
00:39:49,811 --> 00:39:54,544
Because for the first time
in his life...

588
00:39:54,649 --> 00:39:55,809
he was happy.

589
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:57,976
Because he was with you.

590
00:40:00,889 --> 00:40:03,790
What are you suggesting
is the course of action, John?

591
00:40:03,892 --> 00:40:06,725
A. Oliver's going to die...

592
00:40:06,828 --> 00:40:10,764
if he continues
to use his power.

593
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:16,270
B. His power goes away
when he's happy.

594
00:40:16,371 --> 00:40:21,240
And C. You're the father
he never had, and he loves you.

595
00:40:24,446 --> 00:40:26,971
A to B to C.

596
00:40:39,995 --> 00:40:42,088
Come on, Oliver...

597
00:40:42,197 --> 00:40:44,097
you've got to eat
something, man.

598
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,928
Doctor's orders.

599
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:55,867
Talk to him, will ya?

600
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,320
Oliver.

601
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:12,584
You have to understand...

602
00:41:12,694 --> 00:41:15,925
my life's work...

603
00:41:16,031 --> 00:41:18,761
the vindication of it...

604
00:41:18,867 --> 00:41:22,997
it's so important to me.

605
00:41:23,104 --> 00:41:27,131
I let it blind me.

606
00:41:27,242 --> 00:41:31,201
I treated you like a lab rat...

607
00:41:31,313 --> 00:41:34,373
and not a man.

608
00:41:34,482 --> 00:41:36,541
And 30 years ago...

609
00:41:36,651 --> 00:41:41,384
I left with barely a good-bye.

610
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:46,617
I am sorry for that.

611
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:51,697
You can't use your power.

612
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,597
Not ever again.

613
00:41:54,736 --> 00:41:56,966
I forbid it.

614
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,833
I can't be alone.

615
00:42:04,479 --> 00:42:07,607
You won't be.

616
00:42:07,716 --> 00:42:08,944
You've got me.

617
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:13,619
Can you forgive me, Oliver?

618
00:42:17,225 --> 00:42:19,625
Anthony.

619
00:42:41,883 --> 00:42:45,148
[Doggett]
So close, Dana.

620
00:42:45,253 --> 00:42:48,279
I'm sorry you don't
get your proof.

621
00:42:50,892 --> 00:42:52,826
Me, too.

622
00:42:54,329 --> 00:42:56,797
Well, maybe I've had it...

623
00:42:56,898 --> 00:42:59,458
these past nine years.

624
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:06,239
If not proof of
the paranormal, then...

625
00:43:06,341 --> 00:43:09,777
of more important things.

626
00:43:24,326 --> 00:43:26,021
Here's hoping the TV stays off...

627
00:43:26,127 --> 00:43:28,595
and he learns how
to love the real world.

628
00:43:41,876 --> 00:43:44,743
I think you are getting
the hang of this job.

629
00:44:29,691 --> 00:44:31,556
<i>[Child]</i>
<i>I made this.</i>
