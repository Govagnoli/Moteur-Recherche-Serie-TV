1
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,700
Mom!

2
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,400
Watch me!

3
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,400
Okay, Billy!

4
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,200
Mom!

5
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,200
You're not watching!

6
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,000
Mom!

7
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,200
My little boy...
My Billy...

8
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,700
TEN YEARS LATER

9
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,200
Mom!

10
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
Hi.

11
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,600
Josh. I was just coming in.
They know you're supposed to wait.

12
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,000
They're looking for you.

13
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,900
Who?
Who's looking for me?

14
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,400
Hey, what is it?

15
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,300
Go look, Mom.

16
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,300
Mrs. Underwood,
we tried to call you.

17
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,300
You must've already left.

18
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,200
What is everyone staring at?
What is going on?

19
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,400
My beautiful boy.

20
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,600
<i>I'm just going to shine this</i>
<i>light in your eyes, okay?</i>

21
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,900
<i>You're doing great.</i>

22
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,800
<i>See? Nothing to it.</i>

23
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,900
- He won't speak?
- No.

24
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,200
- Not even to his parents.
- Are they here, his parents?

25
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,100
Oh, they've been here
around the clock.

26
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,700
I took his prints... It's him.

27
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,500
Boy should be a teenager by now,
but look at him.

28
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,600
- Explain to me how that can be.
- I can't say, Sheriff.

29
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,500
I'm just here to find out
who took him.

30
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,100
I talked to everyone at school...

31
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,500
...and no one saw him
come back or how.

32
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,000
The boy just come out
of the blue.

33
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,700
- Are those the case files?
- Oh, yeah.

34
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,900
Plenty more where those
came from. There's lots of files.

35
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,900
There's just not much in them.
We never even had a suspect.

36
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,900
Have them set them
over there, would you.

37
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,200
<i>Set those on that table.</i>

38
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,800
Well, what we've got
here is a...

39
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,600
...healthy seven-year-old boy
who was born 17 years ago.

40
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,100
And a healthy boy who
won't speak.

41
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,000
Excuse me?
Are you finished with Billy?  

42
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,400
Mr. and Mrs. Underwood?

43
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,200
Um, you're with the FBI...

44
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,300
Yes. I'm Agent Scully,
and this is Agent Doggett.  

45
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,600
- We are investigating this case.
- It's a miracle, isn't it?

46
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,300
Mrs. Underwood...

47
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,300
...whatever your son
has been through, ...

48
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,300
...it has somehow affected
his physical condition.

49
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,000
So we've been told by
every doctor here.

50
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,900
We just want to take him home.
After ten years, can we do that?

51
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,900
Not yet.

52
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,800
I want to talk to him first.

53
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,300
How you doing, Billy?

54
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,300
My name's John.

55
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,600
I'm gonna have a seat over here,
is that okay?

56
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,900
Is that all right?

57
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,000
Billy, I want you to know
that you're not alone.

58
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,600
I've talked to lots of
other boys and girls...

59
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,100
...who've been hurt
just like you.

60
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,600
Sometimes when they talk about it
the hurt starts to go away.

61
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,100
You want to talk
about it, Billy?

62
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,200
You know, maybe you think bad
things happened to you because...

63
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,800
...you've been a bad boy...

64
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,500
But I'm here to tell you,
that's not true.

65
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,800
The bad guy is the one
who took you away...

66
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,500
...and it's up to you and me
to get the bad guy.

67
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,400
See, 'cause as big and tough
as I am, I can't do it alone.

68
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,800
I need your help.

69
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Can you tell me about him, Billy?

70
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,200
What's his name?
What did he look like?

71
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,100
You remember this,
don't you, Billy?

72
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,000
Would you like to have
that back?

73
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,500
What is he doing?

74
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,500
All I want is his name. 

75
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,000
Who the hell
do you think you are?

76
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,300
He's only a little boy.

77
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Mr. Underwood...?

78
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,900
You think this is a game?

79
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,100
A serious game;
one we have to win.

80
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,700
Have you really worked kid
cases before, Agent Doggett?

81
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,100
Child abductions?

82
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,900
I worked the child abduction
task force. I know the horror stories, ...

83
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,300
- ...but this kid can help us.
- This isn't just a horror story.

84
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,200
This is a biological impossibility.

85
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,900
Well, that's your area of expertise.
I just want to put the person...

86
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,100
...who did this out of business.
Billy just didn't show up.

87
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,900
He got away or was let go.

88
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,800
And if he can talk,
he can tell us by who.  

89
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,900
Or he can look at photos in the
files and point to the man...

90
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,700
...who did this so this doesn't
happen to some other little boy.

91
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,700
You are ignoring the fact that
he is still seven years old.

92
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Failure to thrive.
Isn't that the term?

93
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,600
I mean, aren't there diseases
that delay puberty and so on?

94
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,700
I told you... he's not sick.

95
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,100
Good.

96
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,400
Then he can talk.

97
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,600
We're home, honey.
Safe at home.

98
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,400
I'm going to go pay the sitter,
Doug. You bring Billy in.

99
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,200
Are you glad to be home, Billy?

100
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,400
A lot's new here, son.

101
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,900
You have a younger
brother now.

102
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,700
Josh.

103
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,800
See that big dog
out there with him?

104
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,700
That's Sparky.

105
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,400
Would you like to go
play with him?

106
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,100
- Knock it off!
- What's the matter, Doug?

107
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,000
I don't know.
The dog just went off...

108
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,100
Sparky, what is wrong with you?
Come on, let's go.

109
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,800
Honey, it's all right.

110
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,200
He just didn't recognize you,
that's all.

111
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
He's a nice dog, Sparky.

112
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,500
He just doesn't realize that
you're part of the family.

113
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,100
But you are, Billy...

114
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,200
...and we're just so glad
that you're finally home.

115
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,900
You going to sleep here, too?

116
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,600
What time is it?

117
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,400
I spoke with the doctors
who treated Billy.

118
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,600
- I looked at his charts.
- And what, did you find something?

119
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,300
Yes and no.

120
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,200
What showed up is that Billy is the
same boy who was taken ten years ago.

121
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,500
We know that.

122
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,000
No.

123
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,900
I mean the -same- boy.

124
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,900
He has no cavities.
He has no tooth decay.

125
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,800
He still has four baby
teeth that he's never lost.

126
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,000
He had a routine blood test six
weeks before he disappeared in 1990.

127
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,700
His cell counts, his enzymes,
his hormone levels, ...

128
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,200
...they are all exactly the same
as they were ten years ago.

129
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,000
- Now how can that be possible?
- It's medically impossible.

130
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,800
So, what's the punch line?
Where are you saying he's been?

131
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,700
There are X-File cases...

132
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,600
...that describe similar
paranormal findings.

133
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,100
Alien abductees who came back
with anomalous medical stats.

134
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,800
You know, these words:
"Anomalous", "supernatural", ...

135
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,200
"paranormal..."

136
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,600
They purport to explain something
by not explaining it.

137
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
It's lazy.

138
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,900
I'm not saying that
I can explain it, Agent Doggett, ...

139
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,900
...but this is definitely
not normal.  

140
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,100
I went back to the witnesses
at the crime scene...

141
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,700
...the day Billy vanished,
to this guy, Ronald Purnell.

142
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,300
He was detained,
questioned and dismissed as a suspect.

143
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,000
- What's your interest in this guy?
- He's a high school dropout, ...

144
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
...convicted of possession,
arson, and shoplifting since 1990.

145
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
These are juvenile records.

146
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,600
These are sealed by the court,
Agent Doggett.

147
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
We're not supposed
to have these.

148
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,500
- And we're at a standstill here.
- Yeah, and you're breaking the law.

149
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,300
Look, I want to catch this guy,
Agent Scully, whatever it takes.

150
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,100
We love you so much, Billy.

151
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,400
It's so good to have you back--
to be tucking you in.

152
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Sleep tight.

153
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,900
<i>What is that supposed to mean?</i>

154
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,100
<i>It means that you're blind to</i>
<i>what's going on here, Lisa.</i>

155
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,400
<i>Ten years we prayed for this.</i>
<i>Every night we prayed to God.</i>

156
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,100
I prayed for our son.
That is not the boy I knew, Lisa.

157
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,300
What do you expect him to be?

158
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,300
- They told us this will take time.
- Even Josh is afraid of him.

159
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,900
- He is nothing to be afraid of.
- I wish I could believe that.

160
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,400
<i>How can you sit here</i>
<i>and say these things to me?</i>

161
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,600
<i>I thought this would</i>
<i>make us both so happy.</i>

162
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,700
Anybody in there?

163
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,100
Hello?

164
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,700
Ronald Purnell?

165
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,800
Ronald Purnell?

166
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,200
Yeah.

167
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,600
Can I talk to you?

168
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,000
Can you come out,
and we can have a conversation?

169
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,400
Is this about my probation?

170
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,800
It's about a little boy
named Billy Underwood.

171
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,800
You know that name?
Ring a bell?

172
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,400
No.

173
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,800
It does to everybody else
in this area.

174
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,400
He vanished from a school fair
you were at ten years ago.

175
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,000
You remember him now?

176
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,200
Yeah. I remember him.

177
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,800
You think he'd remember you?

178
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,400
- Me?
- You. Your face.

179
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,100
You're a trip, man.
You know that?

180
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,900
This has nothing to do with you being
stoned or violating your probation.

181
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,100
All I'm asking is that
we go see Billy.

182
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,500
See what he says.

183
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,300
See what he says where?

184
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,300
Where? Wherever. Wherever you want.
I'll make sure he's there.

185
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,500
You're not making sense, Dude.
Just leave me alone.

186
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,700
Honey, are you here?

187
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,000
- What?! What are you doing?!
- Joshey! Oh, my god! Are you hurt?

188
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,200
No.

189
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,400
- You're bleeding.
- Mom!

190
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,500
- Where did that come from?
- I don't know.

191
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,700
Billy, honey what
are you doing here?

192
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Please, Billy, answer me.

193
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,800
Just got word
back from the lab.

194
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,300
Ran the blood twice and
no doubt about it.

195
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,200
It's the little boy's.

196
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
But I thought you
said he wasn't cut.

197
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,700
No. You're misunderstanding.

198
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,300
It's the other son I'mdtalking about, Billy--

199
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,800
...the boy who was kidnapped.

200
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,400
- That doesn't make any sense.
- No. Billy wasn't cut either.

201
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,300
No, but he definitely
handled the knife.

202
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,000
His prints are on it.

203
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Where did he even get it?

204
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,500
His father's never seen it before.
He's no hunter.

205
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,300
Never cleaned an animal,
which is about all...

206
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:24,700
...a knife like that's good for...
except for killing, of course.

207
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,600
Well, I hate to say this...

208
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,800
...but I think that the best
thing for Billy and his family...

209
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,200
...is if he's removed
to an institution...

210
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,500
...under the observation of people
who are experienced in these things.

211
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,900
You mean, remove him?
Take him away?

212
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,000
After all his
family's been through?

213
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,200
This is not a normal child,
Agent Doggett, ...

214
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,200
- ...and this is not a normal act.
- You make it sound like he's possessed.

215
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,200
Call the exorcist.

216
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,800
He's a kid-- a kid who's been through
who knows what kind of hell. 

217
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,300
Give him a chance.

218
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,500
How do you know he's not trying
to communicate something?

219
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,000
And what's the message?

220
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,200
Yes, he's a kid,
Agent Doggett, you're right.

221
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,800
He's a kid who materialized out
of thin air, unaged.

222
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,700
Do you not somehow recognize
how strange this is?

223
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,000
Did anybody notice this?
This symbol?

224
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,400
Yeah.

225
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,900
Yeah, I was going to mention
that to you 'cause it's...

226
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,000
- ...kind of weird.
- Weird how?

227
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,900
Well, like I told you, ...

228
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,500
...we tried everything to find
that boy and who abducted him, ...

229
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,800
...went so far as
to bring in a police psychic...

230
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,400
...ten years back--
came up with that very same symbol.

231
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,300
Well, how exactly did he come up with it?

232
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,600
She. Sharon Pearl.

233
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,300
Couldn't say how
it came to her.

234
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,900
- I've seen this symbol before, too.
- You have?

235
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,200
I'll be damned.

236
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,300
We love you so much, Billy.

237
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,900
Whatever happened...

238
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,700
...we want to put it behind us.

239
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Be a family again.

240
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,400
And if you could help us
to understand...

241
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,200
...what you're going through, ...

242
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,200
...we could move forward.

243
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,600
No, we're just going
to go see a doctor, ...

244
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,400
...someone you might want to talk to.
We're coming right back.

245
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,200
Nothing's going to happen.

246
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Mommy won't let anything
happen to you.

247
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,900
<i>Billy, I just want you</i>
<i>to get the help you need...</i>

248
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,500
<i>...so we can all live here</i>
<i>together and be happy.</i>

249
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,800
Okay?
Come on, sweetie.

250
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,500
I'll take him, Doug.
If it's such a strain on you.

251
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,400
Look, if you think a shrink
can give us some answers, fine.

252
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,400
I just don't want this to ruin
our other son's life in any way.

253
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Where's Billy?

254
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,600
Dad!

255
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,500
I don't want no more
trouble here, Ronnie.

256
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,600
Whatever you're doing,
you do it somewhere else.

257
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,500
You ever get off your lazy ass
to do anything but hassle me?!  

258
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,900
Watch your mouth.

259
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,700
I got company coming and
he won't take your lip.

260
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,700
Who?

261
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,900
You tell him to
stay out of my face.

262
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,700
Get away from me.

263
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,700
Where you going, weirdo?

264
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,100
You steal those clothes
off a fat man? Or'd...

265
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,000
...you just shrink? Hmm?

266
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,500
Hey, you going to get your butt
in this trailer, traveling man?

267
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,600
Yeah.

268
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,600
All depends on, uh...
what you've got in mind.

269
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,900
<i>Testing, one, two, three...</i>

270
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
This is great.

271
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,500
Now, I've got a psychic
sitting in my living room...

272
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,300
...who's going to tell me
what's wrong with my son.

273
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,000
I understand your misgivings,
Mr. Underwood, ...

274
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,200
...but perhaps you can look
at this as just another avenue.

275
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,000
An avenue to what?

276
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,300
We're going to solve this case,
Mr. Underwood.

277
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,000
We're going to find out
who did this to your son.

278
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,900
And then what?
What am I left with?

279
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,100
A kid who stabs knives into
his brother's mattress?

280
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,300
You don't know the half of it.

281
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,200
He gives everyone but his mother
the creeps with that stare of his.

282
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,100
I just know that this is
going to tear you apart.

283
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,700
It's going to tear your family apart.
And you can't let it.

284
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,600
You've got to save them from
the damage this can do.

285
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,700
I'll be happy to save
what I can.

286
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,100
Come on, Josh. Let's go.

287
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,600
- Is this going to happen?
- Shouldn't you be telling us that?

288
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,300
You're no doubt confused,
Agent Doggett.

289
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,800
I take psychic readings
not see through walls.

290
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,100
Sorry to keep you waiting.

291
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,800
Mrs. Underwood.
I'm Sharon Pearl.

292
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,900
I consulted on your son's
disappearance back in 1990.

293
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,900
And you're Billy?

294
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,000
Ms. Pearl?
Are you okay?

295
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
There are very powerful
forces at work here.

296
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,500
Working through this boy.

297
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,300
Drawing him to his brother.

298
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,800
I feel this force...

299
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,600
I feel this force...

300
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,800
...coming through you.

301
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,400
You lost someone just like Billy.

302
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,000
What's happening to her?

303
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,000
Oh, my God.

304
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,300
Hey, Fartknocker.

305
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,500
Where are you going
in such a big hurry?

306
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,200
What's the matter?
Got something in your ears?

307
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,600
Don't .. don't touch me, Cal.

308
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,400
Oh, listen to him.

309
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,600
No wonder he wears them
baggy britches.

310
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,600
Our Ronnie's a big man now.

311
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,500
Your old lady said...

312
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,600
...the cops came
and talked to you. Hmm?

313
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,000
I am talking to you,
not the side of your head.

314
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,600
Better mind your
Ps and Qs, Jones.

315
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,500
Or I'm going to tell them
what you did to that little boy.

316
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:34,300
I'm going to tell them what you
got buried out there in the woods.

317
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,900
What's going on
with you two?

318
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,800
Talking about cars.

319
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,600
Well, they've got her
stabilized...

320
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,900
...and it looks like
she's going to be okay...

321
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,800
...if you're at all curious
about her condition.

322
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,600
I'd be more curious
if I believed it.

323
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,800
Believed what?

324
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
The act.

325
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,400
- You think that was an act?
- It's pretty standard fare, isn't it?

326
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,800
Float a few choice revelations,
as if they came from on high, ...

327
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,500
...roll around on the floor.

328
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,100
You saw that symbol appear
on her forehead.

329
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:00,700
It's a damn good trick.
Don't ask me how she does it.

330
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:10,300
- Agent Scully, please.
- No. I think you want to hear this.

331
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,400
Now listen to it backwards.

332
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,000
<i>- When you wake...<i>
- What was that?

333
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,100
<i>- ...you shall have...</i>
- It's a child singing.

334
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,500
<i>- ...all the pretty little horses...</i>
- Lyrics.

335
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,500
<i>Hush-a-bye,</i>
<i>don't you cry...</i>

336
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:43,200
<i>...go to sleep,</i>
<i>little baby...</i>

337
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,300
You hear that,
under the noise?

338
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
- Now--
- What's he doing here?

339
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,200
Get away from me!

340
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,200
Ronnie, open up the car!

341
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,200
Ronnie, stop the car!

342
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,700
Agent Scully, he's got Billy!

343
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,300
Get out of the car!

344
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,800
Now!

345
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,600
Don't move, Ronnie.

346
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,900
Where's Billy?

347
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,000
I thought you said
Billy was in the car?

348
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,400
Where's Billy?

349
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,100
I'm going to go pay.
You want anything?

350
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,800
Josh, are you okay, buddy?

351
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,400
Dad, can I...?

352
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,700
Mister?

353
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,700
Pony?

354
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,700
Hey, pony.

355
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,000
Hey, there you are.

356
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,600
Help! Help!

357
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,700
- Count to ten, Agent Doggett.
- He took Billy.

358
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,600
He couldn't have.

359
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,500
How are you going to back that up
with Billy now missing from his home?

360
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,800
By the certain knowledge that
not five minutes earlier, ...

361
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,000
...I saw him enter his
home with his mother.

362
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,800
I saw him! I saw Billy
riding in the car with Ronnie.

363
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,500
Why else would Ronnie
take off like he did?

364
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,700
It's impossible, Agent Doggett,
like everything else about this case.

365
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,800
Like how Billy can be
in his home one minute...

366
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,600
...and then in
Ronnie's car the next.

367
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,000
Everything about this
case is impossible.

368
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,500
This kid is the key,
Agent Scully.

369
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,300
I've been saying that from
the beginning and I'll say it now.

370
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,200
Agent Doggett, Agent Scully,
I got bad news on top of worse.

371
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,100
Josh, the Underwood's other
little boy, has disappeared.  

372
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,500
I'm not joking, not even close.

373
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,000
I got the parents
out here now.

374
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:14,400
I've got to talk to this kid,
Agent Scully.

375
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,000
I'm absolutely sure.

376
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,500
Have a seat, Ronnie.

377
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,200
I know what you're
going to ask...

378
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,300
...but I got no answer.

379
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,000
Well, there can be
only one answer, right?

380
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,400
I mean, why else did you
go to the house?

381
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,700
You went there for Billy,
to get him back.

382
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,600
No.

383
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,600
- You had him in your car.
- I don't know how he got there.

384
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,800
Then why go to the
house at all?

385
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,400
Because I didn't believe you.

386
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,600
Mom!

387
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,600
You didn't believe what?
What's so hard to believe, Ronnie?

388
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,900
- You said I could talk to him.
- You needed to talk to him.

389
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,600
After all those years,
you couldn't live without him.

390
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,800
You wanted him back.

391
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,000
All those years, Ronnie.
All those years.

392
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,500
Where'd you keep him?

393
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,900
Man, you don't understand.

394
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,000
You were sorry you let him go.

395
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,800
No, I...

396
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,500
I couldn't let him go.

397
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,400
"When you wake...

398
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,400
...you shall have...

399
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,100
...all the pretty little horses."

400
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,000
Who else knew about him?
Your mom?

401
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,800
No.

402
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,700
- Where'd you keep him?
- I didn't.

403
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,700
- What did you do to him?!
- I didn't do anything.

404
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,400
I took care of him.

405
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,300
I sang to him...

406
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,200
...you know,
so he wouldn't be afraid.

407
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,600
Afraid of who?

408
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,600
Who was he afraid of,
Ronnie?

409
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:57,500
Somebody else involved?
Somebody else make you do it?

410
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,700
He take that other kid, too?

411
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,700
Billy's brother?
He take him?

412
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
You're afraid of him,
too, aren't you?

413
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,000
You're a victim, just like
those other kids. Is that right?

414
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,800
You... me, Billy.

415
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,800
This is our chance, man.

416
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,300
What's his name?

417
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,100
FBI!

418
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,600
Cal Jeppy! Come out!

419
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,000
It's okay, Josh.

420
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
You're okay.
We're not going to hurt you.

421
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,600
Agent Doggett...

422
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,500
He's on the run.

423
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,600
He's in the woods!
Watch your fire!

424
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,800
There may be another boy!

425
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,000
Down on your knees!

426
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,200
Hands in the air!
Where's the kid?!

427
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,200
- He's in the trailer.
- Other kid!

428
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,300
- There's no other kid.
- Billy Underwood!

429
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,500
There's no other kid.

430
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,100
Get this man in cuffs!
Read him his rights!

431
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,900
The kid's over...

432
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,200
I don't believe it.

433
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Okay, the clothes,
the age and condition of the bones, ...

434
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,600
...the location of the grave.

435
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,100
There is no doubt that that
is Billy Underwood's skeleton...

436
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,700
- ...that is in that grave.
- We spent time with this boy.

437
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,600
Doctors took Billy's blood.
You examined him yourself.

438
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,100
Now, I can't accept it.

439
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,900
I can't believe we're
asking them to.

440
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,900
I know, but the forensic evidence
is going to come out, and what then?

441
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,000
- What if I'm right?
- Well, what then, Agent Scully?

442
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,900
What we do? We move on,
let it go, case closed?

443
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,100
Look, I know where you are
with this. I have been there.

444
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,300
I know what you're feeling--
that you've failed and that you have...

445
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:40,000
...to explain this somehow.

446
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,300
And maybe you can.

447
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,300
Not if that's Billy's body,
I can't.

448
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,000
But maybe that's
explanation enough.

449
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,600
That that's not Billy's brother
lying in that grave, too.

450
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,800
That that man who did this is never
going to be able to do it again.

451
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,300
Isn't that what you wanted,
Agent Doggett?

452
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,800
Agent Scully, don't ask me
to believe that...

453
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,800
...this is some kind of justice
from beyond the grave.

454
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,800
All I'm saying is that
maybe you succeeded...

455
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,800
Whether you're willing
to see that or not.
