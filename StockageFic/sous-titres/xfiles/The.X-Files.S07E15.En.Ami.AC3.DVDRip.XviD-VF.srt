1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,846
Almost home now, Jason.
What do we say?

2
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:19,078
Sticks and stones may break my bones,

3
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:21,416
but words can never hurt me.

4
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:24,753
Keep your chin up, son.
We'll get through this just fine.

5
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,832
Jason, have you got a comment?
How do you feel, Jason?

6
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,137
Back up! Back up, there!

7
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,480
Okay, folks, come on out.
You're safe now.

8
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,856
Just step out and stay in front of me.
We'll get you in your house.

9
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,361
- Come on, son.
- Just stay in front of me.

10
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,077
There you go, sweetheart.

11
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:28,882
If you need anything
during the night,

12
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:32,391
if you don't feel well,
you just ring that bell, okay?

13
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,121
Okay, Mom.

14
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,493
Good night, Jason.

15
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:54,172
I know you're afraid.

16
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:59,041
Maybe you think those people
outside are right...

17
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,350
that we should take you to the hospital
and let the doctors treat you.

18
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,690
We could do that.

19
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:11,196
And they might take away your cancer
and your body might feel better,

20
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,858
but not your soul.

21
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:17,767
It's God himself who gave you
this illness, Jason,

22
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:20,670
for reasons that are his.

23
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,767
If you're to be well
in body and spirit,

24
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,972
it's God who must come
to deliver you.

25
00:05:00,698 --> 00:05:03,758
Good morning. Here's a story to warm
the cockles of your heart, Scully.

26
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:07,770
"An 11-year-old boy diagnosed with
lymphatic cancer cured with a miracle."

27
00:05:07,838 --> 00:05:09,897
Jason McPeck.
Goochland, Virginia.

28
00:05:09,974 --> 00:05:11,874
Oh.

29
00:05:11,942 --> 00:05:15,878
Yeah, his parents refused
treatment on religious grounds.

30
00:05:15,946 --> 00:05:18,176
His faith forbids
medical aid,

31
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:20,444
and soJason's cure
was delivered by angels.

32
00:05:22,353 --> 00:05:25,811
Well, spontaneous remission, Mulder,
isn't completely unheard of.

33
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,188
So-called "miracle" recoveries
attributable...

34
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,193
to no clear cause or reason.

35
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:33,458
It's not the miracle I'm suspicious of.
It's the messenger.

36
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:35,465
That came as
an anonymous e-mail to me...

37
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:38,468
from the Defense Advance
Research Projects Agency.

38
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:41,096
- DARPA?
- Someone at DARPA.

39
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:43,868
How'd you hear about it?

40
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:49,738
You subscribe to
the Goochland Guardian?

41
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:51,281
No.

42
00:05:51,348 --> 00:05:53,407
So this just appeared miraculously
on your doorstep this morning?

43
00:05:53,484 --> 00:05:56,112
As far as I can tell, I was
the only one to whom it was delivered.

44
00:05:56,187 --> 00:05:58,655
Someone wants us
on this case.

45
00:05:58,722 --> 00:06:01,589
- It's not a case, Mulder.
- Yeah, not yet.

46
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:03,524
I'm gonna go
back over to DARPA.

47
00:06:03,594 --> 00:06:05,619
You see what else you can
find out about that boy.

48
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:10,164
I just gotta know whether it was
Roma Downey or Della Reese.

49
00:06:28,686 --> 00:06:30,620
- Yes?
- Hi.

50
00:06:30,688 --> 00:06:34,317
I'm Dana Scully with
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

51
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:38,293
- Are you Mrs. McPeck?
- What can we do for you?

52
00:06:38,362 --> 00:06:40,694
I'm here about your son.

53
00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:42,959
- Are we under investigation?
- Uh, no.

54
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:47,333
I-I was just hoping to better
understand what happened to him.

55
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:50,430
- May I ask, is he okay?
- Jason, you've got somebody to see you.

56
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:55,345
- Tell her how you're feeling.
- I feel good.

57
00:06:55,412 --> 00:06:57,437
Just a little out of breath.

58
00:06:57,515 --> 00:06:59,449
You're looking at God's work.

59
00:06:59,517 --> 00:07:02,782
Jason's life owes to his grace
and exalts his name in the highest.

60
00:07:02,853 --> 00:07:05,014
- Praise the Lord.
- Praise the Lord.
- Praise the Lord.

61
00:07:06,423 --> 00:07:08,789
And you say that
you saw angels?

62
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:13,158
- Yes.
- May I ask what they looked like?

63
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,698
They looked like men.

64
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:18,166
They came from the sky
in a ball of light.

65
00:07:19,537 --> 00:07:22,472
- And what did they say?
- They said not to be afraid.

66
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,373
Then one of them
pinched me kind of hard.

67
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:28,570
- And then I was better right away.
- He pinched you? Where?

68
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:30,511
Right here.

69
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,537
- What the hell are you doing?
- God's work. What else?

70
00:08:03,614 --> 00:08:07,812
- Get out of my car.
- I'd hoped for more
accommodation toward the man...

71
00:08:07,885 --> 00:08:10,683
who saved that young boy's life,
and yours.

72
00:08:11,755 --> 00:08:14,280
You got your light.
Now get out.

73
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:23,633
You're not at all curious...

74
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:27,193
about the chip that's been
put in that boy's neck?

75
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:30,934
You, a medical doctor, who has
the same technology in your body,

76
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:33,602
who's witnessed this
wondrous miracle firsthand?

77
00:08:33,677 --> 00:08:38,478
I've taken considerable trouble
to prove my intentions.

78
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:42,212
The newspaper at your door,
the e-mail to Mulder,

79
00:08:42,286 --> 00:08:45,983
the elaborate demonstration
of curing this boy's cancer.

80
00:08:46,056 --> 00:08:48,456
You see,
I'm dying myself.

81
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:54,592
A dying man who wants to make right...
to share his secrets...

82
00:08:54,665 --> 00:08:57,065
and to bequeath this cure to millions
of others, just like that boy.

83
00:08:57,134 --> 00:08:59,728
So you wanna give it to us?

84
00:08:59,803 --> 00:09:01,634
To you, Agent Scully.

85
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:05,505
I've tired of
Mulder's muleheadedness.

86
00:09:05,576 --> 00:09:07,942
His foolish ideas
of overthrowing the system.

87
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:10,503
You think
I'm fooled by this?

88
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:12,606
I made you my offer.

89
00:09:12,683 --> 00:09:16,084
Agent Mulder hears a breath of this,
rest assure I'll rescind it.

90
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:20,087
Take it to my grave.

91
00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:17,676
- Yes, I need a trace
on a D.C. area phone number.

92
00:10:17,748 --> 00:10:21,240
I need an address.
Thank you.

93
00:10:34,998 --> 00:10:38,559
- May I help you?
- I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

94
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:43,201
- May I see some identification?

95
00:10:45,476 --> 00:10:48,070
Look, is this necessary?
I just walked through the wrong door.

96
00:10:48,145 --> 00:10:49,908
Your identification, please.

97
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:08,565
- Look...
- Third floor.

98
00:11:44,902 --> 00:11:46,836
Agent Scully.

99
00:12:00,481 --> 00:12:02,346
Please, sit.

100
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:10,289
- I'm glad you came.
- You obviously knew that I would.

101
00:12:10,358 --> 00:12:15,455
- Well, I know you're a doctor
and a woman of compassion.
- Please.

102
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:24,070
In the end...

103
00:12:25,506 --> 00:12:28,134
a man finally looks
at the sum of his life...

104
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:30,143
to see what
he'll leave behind.

105
00:12:30,211 --> 00:12:33,180
Most of what I worked to build
is in ruins.

106
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:36,216
And now that
the darkness descends,

107
00:12:36,284 --> 00:12:38,775
I find I have
no real legacy.

108
00:12:40,688 --> 00:12:42,622
What are you dying of?

109
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,694
Cerebral inflammation.

110
00:12:47,762 --> 00:12:49,855
A consequence of brain surgery
I had in the fall.

111
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:51,865
The doctors give me
just a few months.

112
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:55,300
So you want to use me
to clear the slate...

113
00:12:56,537 --> 00:12:59,370
to make you
a respectable person?

114
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,374
It won't work.

115
00:13:03,044 --> 00:13:05,535
How many people in the world
are dying of cancer?

116
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:10,280
And here we are
wasting time with the past.

117
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:12,717
I'm here.
Where is it?

118
00:13:12,787 --> 00:13:16,154
This miracle cure of yours.

119
00:13:16,224 --> 00:13:19,819
We'll need to take a trip.
It will require a few days.

120
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:22,658
I'll get back to you.

121
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,925
I have access, Agent Scully.

122
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:30,029
I have these miraculous chips, but the
genetic research that makes them work...

123
00:13:30,104 --> 00:13:32,766
is closely guarded.

124
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,865
There are men in this building
who would kill me if they knew...

125
00:13:34,942 --> 00:13:37,342
what I'd offered you.

126
00:13:37,411 --> 00:13:39,606
They'd kill you too
in the blink of an eye.

127
00:13:41,782 --> 00:13:44,751
I've destroyed a lot
of things in my life,

128
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,454
including the people
most precious to me.

129
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:53,859
All I want is a chance to do something
in service to man before I go.

130
00:14:08,476 --> 00:14:12,003
Call received 8:01 p.m.

131
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,343
Mulder, it's me.
I wanted to let you know...

132
00:14:14,415 --> 00:14:16,542
that I'll be out of town
for a day or two.

133
00:14:16,617 --> 00:14:19,177
It's a family emergency.

134
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:21,187
I'll call you when I can.

135
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:32,021
- This is Dana Scully.
I'm not in right now.

136
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:34,727
- Please leave a message after the beep.

137
00:14:34,802 --> 00:14:37,669
Hey, Scully, it's me.
Pick up if you're there.

138
00:14:37,738 --> 00:14:40,764
Scully, you there?

139
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:43,776
All right, I just... I got your message,
and I hope everything's okay.

140
00:14:43,844 --> 00:14:45,778
I'll try you
on your cell right now.

141
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,676
You're going to smoke?

142
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:08,521
- It's time I quit.
- Just like that?

143
00:16:08,596 --> 00:16:11,497
No sacrifice
is purely altruistic.

144
00:16:11,565 --> 00:16:14,159
We give,
expecting to receive.

145
00:16:14,235 --> 00:16:16,669
What exactly is it
you expect to receive?

146
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:21,608
Your trust.

147
00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:26,772
You question my sincerity.
You think I'm heartless.

148
00:16:26,847 --> 00:16:29,281
Would it soften your opinion
of me if I confessed that...

149
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,682
I've always had
a particular affection for you?

150
00:16:35,156 --> 00:16:37,215
I assure you,
my intentions are honorable.

151
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,282
I have affection
for Mulder too.

152
00:16:40,428 --> 00:16:42,362
My affection for you
is special.

153
00:16:43,464 --> 00:16:46,524
I held your life in my hands.

154
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,626
Your cancer was terminal,
and I had a cure.

155
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:51,638
Can you imagine
what that's like?

156
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:54,266
To have the power
to extinguish a life...

157
00:16:54,342 --> 00:16:56,333
or to save it
and let it flourish?

158
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,047
Now to give you that power...

159
00:17:03,117 --> 00:17:05,051
so you can do the same.

160
00:17:08,889 --> 00:17:11,687
She said
it was a family matter.

161
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,752
Dropped off the key, asked me
to water the plants. No biggie.

162
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,526
A great girl.
Independent as they come, you know?

163
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,567
- She's a great girl.
- Yeah, yeah.

164
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:23,159
Tenants like having
an F.B.I. agent in the building.

165
00:17:23,237 --> 00:17:25,171
Gives them
a sense of security.

166
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:27,469
Do you know how many people
have died in there?

167
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:31,204
- We don't talk about that.
- You said she was carrying a suitcase.

168
00:17:31,278 --> 00:17:33,644
Did you notice anything else?
Anything abnormal?

169
00:17:33,714 --> 00:17:37,115
No, no. Actually,
it wasn't her carrying the suitcase.

170
00:17:37,184 --> 00:17:39,948
- It was her driver.
- Her driver?

171
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,954
Yeah, an older guy.
Tall.

172
00:17:42,022 --> 00:17:44,786
I've seen him here before.
Smokes like a chimney.

173
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:49,295
Hey, don't you want...

174
00:18:03,744 --> 00:18:07,646
You've been at the wheel too long.
Would you like me to drive?

175
00:18:07,715 --> 00:18:10,479
I might if you let me know
where we're going.

176
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,311
Knowing that, you'd feel comfortable?
You'd trust me?

177
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,059
How long did it take Mulder
to win your trust?

178
00:18:20,127 --> 00:18:22,186
I've always trusted Mulder.

179
00:18:23,631 --> 00:18:27,328
You're not being honest with yourself.
Think back.

180
00:18:27,401 --> 00:18:29,528
There was a time when you feared
for your future, for your career,

181
00:18:29,603 --> 00:18:32,504
when you were first partnered
with this man.

182
00:18:32,573 --> 00:18:34,734
I told you,
I've studied you for years.

183
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:39,141
And if you would permit me,
I'd like to make an observation.

184
00:18:40,648 --> 00:18:43,412
You're drawn to powerful men,

185
00:18:43,484 --> 00:18:46,385
but you fear their power.

186
00:18:46,454 --> 00:18:49,890
You keep your guard up...
a wall around your heart.

187
00:18:49,957 --> 00:18:52,152
How else do you explain
that fearless devotion...

188
00:18:52,226 --> 00:18:54,717
to a man obsessed
and a life alone?

189
00:18:55,796 --> 00:18:58,094
You'd die for Mulder,

190
00:18:58,165 --> 00:19:00,099
but you won't allow yourself
to love him.

191
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,804
Wow.

192
00:19:04,872 --> 00:19:07,102
I'm learning
a whole other side to you.

193
00:19:07,174 --> 00:19:12,009
You're not just a coldblooded killer.
You're a pop psychologist as well.

194
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:15,915
I've been a destroyer
all my life.

195
00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:19,978
Before I die,

196
00:19:20,054 --> 00:19:23,023
I'd like to prove that
I'm capable of something more.

197
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:28,287
- Turn here, on the left.
- Where are we going?

198
00:19:28,362 --> 00:19:30,296
To show you
what I'm capable of.

199
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:13,263
Her name's Marjorie Butters.
She's got quite a green thumb.

200
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:16,432
Plays a mean game of Scrabble,
if you're interested.

201
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,942
And what's
her relationship to you?

202
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,944
Well, how should I put it?

203
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:24,072
You could say that
I'm her angel.

204
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:26,242
Marjorie's 118 years old.

205
00:20:36,394 --> 00:20:40,125
- Oh!
- I thought I'd surprise you.

206
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:45,397
I look an absolute wreck.
I've been trying to get in
some bulbs before spring.

207
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:51,539
Marjorie, this is Dana Scully.
She's a very good friend of mine.

208
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,010
- Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

209
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,139
Well, come inside.
I baked some fresh bread this morning.

210
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,309
And there are tomatoes
from the garden.

211
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,478
I'll put the kettle on.

212
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,958
To have this power...

213
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:13,497
to visit this woman
and see her joy...

214
00:21:16,802 --> 00:21:18,736
It must be why
you became a doctor.

215
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:31,715
I'll expect your call.
Thanks.

216
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:34,843
She requisitioned a fleet sedan
when she left the Bureau yesterday.

217
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,388
I don't know why,
and there have been no fuel charges.

218
00:21:37,455 --> 00:21:39,889
Her mother doesn't know anything
about a family emergency.

219
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,893
Look, I know you're worried
about the company that she's in.

220
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:45,657
But from what you've told me,
it's not like she's sneaking out.

221
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,426
And the truth is, she's gone to
a lot of trouble to allay your fears.

222
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,764
I know she can
take care of herself.

223
00:21:50,836 --> 00:21:52,770
It's just not like her
to lie to me.

224
00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:57,341
That's my private line.

225
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,044
- Skinner.
-  Sir?

226
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,876
- Agent Scully, where are you?
- I'm on the road.

227
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:07,077
- I'm sorry to call you on this line.
- It's all right.

228
00:22:07,152 --> 00:22:08,710
It's just we've been
worried about you.

229
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:12,621
Everything's okay. I just wanted you
to express that to Mulder.

230
00:22:12,691 --> 00:22:16,923
- He's standing right here.
Why don't you do that yourself.
- No, sir, that's all right.

231
00:22:16,995 --> 00:22:20,931
Can you tell him that I'll call him
later? Just tell him that I'm fine.

232
00:22:23,435 --> 00:22:25,369
She said she's fine.

233
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,438
She's in trouble.

234
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,059
I'm going
to the restroom.

235
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,150
Mulder, I'm trusting you'll be able
to make sense of what's on this tape.

236
00:23:17,222 --> 00:23:19,349
I had no other way
of contacting you.

237
00:23:19,424 --> 00:23:21,619
Please try and understand
that I weighed the risks.

238
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:23,752
I couldn't divulge these plans
without risking them,

239
00:23:23,828 --> 00:23:26,296
and I promise you
that I weighed everything.

240
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:29,663
Our current location is northbound
on the Upstate Expressway.

241
00:23:29,734 --> 00:23:32,999
We're driving
my F.B.I. fleet sedan.

242
00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:35,869
I promise I will get these tapes
to you as fast as I can.

243
00:23:53,758 --> 00:23:56,318
Oh!
Excuse me.

244
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,864
Lifesaver?

245
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:39,835
You may as well get comfortable.
We've got a good drive ahead.

246
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:20,137
It's the masters of disguise.

247
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:23,800
- Can we laugh it up in your apartment?
- We got heat on our tail.

248
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:26,241
We did what you asked,
pulled up what we could on Scully.

249
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:29,803
We started with her credit cards to see
if she purchased any airline tickets.

250
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:32,714
And ended up hacking into
some defense department node.

251
00:26:32,784 --> 00:26:35,184
Where they demanded that
we immediately identify ourselves...

252
00:26:35,253 --> 00:26:38,381
or face prosecution for espionage
or crimes against the government.

253
00:26:38,456 --> 00:26:40,447
What does this have to do
with finding Scully?

254
00:26:40,525 --> 00:26:44,188
When we went into her computer, we found
a series of deleted transmissions.

255
00:26:44,262 --> 00:26:47,493
E-mail that had been erased from her
sub-directories, but not her hard drive.

256
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:51,399
- A series of communications.
- From someone named Cobra.

257
00:26:51,469 --> 00:26:54,905
Who the hell is Cobra?
Scully would have told me about him.

258
00:26:54,973 --> 00:26:58,534
Well, looks like she's gone to
great lengths to keep this from you.

259
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:03,138
I don't believe that. She knows
that I'd find her no matter what.

260
00:27:03,214 --> 00:27:06,081
Mulder, we can't find her.
There's nowhere to start looking.

261
00:27:06,151 --> 00:27:08,551
Yeah, I don't
believe that either.

262
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,554
Give me that.

263
00:27:56,665 --> 00:27:58,826
How do you take your coffee?

264
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,834
Unadulterated, thank you.

265
00:28:03,705 --> 00:28:05,639
You drugged me.

266
00:28:05,707 --> 00:28:07,698
I did nothing of the sort.

267
00:28:07,776 --> 00:28:10,108
How the hell did I get
out of my clothes and into bed?

268
00:28:10,178 --> 00:28:13,045
I carried you.
You'd been up for over 30 hours.

269
00:28:13,115 --> 00:28:16,448
You were delirious.
I only wanted to make you comfortable.

270
00:28:20,222 --> 00:28:23,055
- Where are we?
- Milford, Pennsylvania.

271
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:25,457
Well, that wasn't
part of the deal.

272
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:28,087
I don't know
what you're up to.

273
00:28:34,069 --> 00:28:36,594
The keys are in the ignition.

274
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:38,605
You're free to go, of course.

275
00:28:40,342 --> 00:28:42,469
The choice is still yours.

276
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:02,760
Sir, I need your attention.

277
00:29:02,831 --> 00:29:04,765
- Is my assistant...
- No.

278
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:06,767
She's away from her desk.
I wouldn't just bust in here,

279
00:29:06,835 --> 00:29:09,531
- But as I said,
it's a breaking situation.
- What the hell's going on?

280
00:29:09,604 --> 00:29:13,665
- That's my question exactly.
I believe you've all met.
- Is this place secure?

281
00:29:13,742 --> 00:29:16,142
- Is it secure?
- Don't get testy, G-man.

282
00:29:16,211 --> 00:29:19,612
Are you aware of a federal fugitive
code-named Cobra?

283
00:29:21,883 --> 00:29:23,942
For the past six months,
Cobra's been e-mailing Scully...

284
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:26,146
from the Department of Defense
where he works on a shadow project...

285
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:28,052
for advanced research.

286
00:29:28,123 --> 00:29:31,354
- A shadow project is right.
- Where this dude works,
even the shadows have shadows.

287
00:29:31,426 --> 00:29:34,452
- Is that what I'm looking at here?
- No.

288
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:37,862
What they're pulling up is
Scully's correspondence back to Cobra.

289
00:29:37,933 --> 00:29:40,197
- She has a relationship?
- No. Somebody posing as Scully...

290
00:29:40,268 --> 00:29:43,465
who hacked into her computer
and has been capturing all her e-mail,

291
00:29:43,538 --> 00:29:47,599
passing themselves off as Scully
in order to win Cobra's trust.

292
00:29:47,676 --> 00:29:49,871
The last five exchanges
hinted a meeting...

293
00:29:49,945 --> 00:29:52,812
where they're gonna exchange information
on the project Cobra's working on.

294
00:29:52,881 --> 00:29:55,406
- A meeting? Where?
-  Don't know.

295
00:29:55,484 --> 00:29:59,147
- They just ended.
- Who's been in her computer?

296
00:29:59,221 --> 00:30:01,587
Smoking Man,
or someone working for him.

297
00:30:01,656 --> 00:30:03,647
You gotta get to him now.

298
00:30:03,725 --> 00:30:06,592
You of all people should know
that you just don't get to him.

299
00:30:06,661 --> 00:30:10,495
If you don't get to him, it may be
the last time we see Scully alive.

300
00:30:23,745 --> 00:30:25,975
We'll be getting final instructions
from our contact tonight.

301
00:30:26,047 --> 00:30:28,379
He's... He's invited us
to dinner.

302
00:30:32,087 --> 00:30:34,385
I took the liberty of
getting you something to wear.

303
00:30:38,326 --> 00:30:41,090
It's, uh...
It's beautiful.

304
00:30:41,162 --> 00:30:43,790
I'm glad you like it.

305
00:30:43,865 --> 00:30:46,129
I look forward
to tonight.

306
00:31:29,778 --> 00:31:33,009
- So your contact's going to join us?
- I presume so.

307
00:31:33,081 --> 00:31:37,848
You extol our great trust, but
you still haven't told me who he is.

308
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,150
He is to human
genetic science...

309
00:31:41,222 --> 00:31:45,488
as Oppenheimer and Fermi were
to the advent of nuclear warfare.

310
00:31:46,962 --> 00:31:51,092
I'm still not clear what my
importance is to this exchange.

311
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,936
This man...
We'll call him Cobra...

312
00:31:56,004 --> 00:31:58,199
he needs assurances...

313
00:31:58,273 --> 00:32:01,674
that the science he's gonna hand over
won't fall into the wrong hands.

314
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:09,509
- I've told him of you.
He's expecting to meet you here.

315
00:32:13,088 --> 00:32:15,022
Well...

316
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,024
to the future.

317
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:26,033
I must tell you
something else.

318
00:32:28,637 --> 00:32:30,764
Something
that's so unbelievable,

319
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:32,773
so incredible,

320
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,635
that to know it is to
look at the entire world anew.

321
00:32:37,712 --> 00:32:39,509
What?

322
00:32:39,581 --> 00:32:44,177
What we are being given,
it's not the cure for cancer.

323
00:32:46,988 --> 00:32:49,286
It's the holiest
of grails, Dana.

324
00:32:52,193 --> 00:32:54,354
It's the cure
for all human disease.

325
00:32:57,832 --> 00:32:59,766
How?

326
00:33:01,936 --> 00:33:04,029
It's from that final frontier.

327
00:33:05,507 --> 00:33:07,441
It's largely
extraterrestrial.

328
00:33:14,449 --> 00:33:16,383
Then you would be cured.

329
00:33:17,886 --> 00:33:19,877
That which makes miracles...

330
00:33:21,489 --> 00:33:23,423
can also make great evil.

331
00:33:23,491 --> 00:33:28,019
There are those who would use
this power for their own purposes.

332
00:33:28,096 --> 00:33:31,361
To choose who will live
and who will die.

333
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,161
Theoretically,
I can be cured, but...

334
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:41,003
everything I've told you
about wanting to make right?

335
00:33:46,047 --> 00:33:48,277
I'm a lonely man, Dana.

336
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:58,588
Would you excuse me?

337
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:43,937
Cobra hasn't shown.

338
00:34:44,005 --> 00:34:47,065
- What do you wanna do?
- Wait. What else can we do?

339
00:34:48,777 --> 00:34:51,439
What trust you've won...

340
00:34:51,513 --> 00:34:53,640
Scully won't
stick around forever.

341
00:34:56,985 --> 00:34:58,919
What's wrong?

342
00:35:00,355 --> 00:35:02,289
Just do your damn job.

343
00:35:51,071 --> 00:35:54,131
Calico inlet's 15 minutes out.
South end.

344
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:57,768
- What do I do when I get there?
- I don't know. Just wait.

345
00:36:02,048 --> 00:36:03,982
Be careful.

346
00:37:11,084 --> 00:37:13,018
Finally we meet.

347
00:37:13,086 --> 00:37:18,820
You're just as you described yourself.
Certainly more so last night at dinner.

348
00:37:21,795 --> 00:37:24,263
I only wish we could continue
to correspond,

349
00:37:24,331 --> 00:37:27,858
but it must end after this.

350
00:37:27,934 --> 00:37:30,266
I hope one day
we can take some time...

351
00:37:30,337 --> 00:37:32,328
when I'm not a marked man.

352
00:37:34,174 --> 00:37:37,200
This is it...
the science I promised you.

353
00:37:42,582 --> 00:37:45,517
Well, wait.
Where did you get this?

354
00:37:45,585 --> 00:37:48,418
- Where did it come from, this science?
- Where did it come from?

355
00:37:48,488 --> 00:37:51,685
- Who developed it?
- Scully?

356
00:37:51,758 --> 00:37:55,455
Yes, I'm Scully, but I don't believe
we've spoken before or corresponded.

357
00:39:19,846 --> 00:39:21,814
They shot him.
They killed him.

358
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:24,509
And they shot at me.

359
00:39:26,419 --> 00:39:30,287
- Did you get it?
- You told me that
no one else knew about this!

360
00:39:30,356 --> 00:39:33,154
I wouldn't have sent you
if I thought there'd be any danger.

361
00:39:36,529 --> 00:39:39,498
Dana.

362
00:39:39,566 --> 00:39:41,500
Yes, I got it.

363
00:39:45,805 --> 00:39:47,739
Forgive me.

364
00:39:49,209 --> 00:39:53,543
Here. Take it.
This is for you.

365
00:39:53,613 --> 00:39:55,547
I gotta go.

366
00:39:58,818 --> 00:40:00,911
Go.

367
00:40:37,924 --> 00:40:39,858
There's nothing on this.

368
00:40:39,926 --> 00:40:42,827
- It's empty.
- Completely.

369
00:40:42,896 --> 00:40:45,797
No. It can't be.

370
00:40:45,865 --> 00:40:48,390
It can't be.

371
00:40:48,468 --> 00:40:50,402
It's got to be on there.

372
00:41:30,977 --> 00:41:33,741
He was here!

373
00:41:33,813 --> 00:41:38,147
These were his offices.
What the hell is this?

374
00:41:38,217 --> 00:41:40,412
He used you.

375
00:41:40,486 --> 00:41:42,647
Mulder, he laid it all out for me.
I recorded it.

376
00:41:42,722 --> 00:41:45,452
I mailed you the tape.

377
00:41:45,525 --> 00:41:48,494
This old woman, Marjorie Butters,
I met her.

378
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:50,620
I saw her pictures,
her birth certificate.

379
00:41:50,697 --> 00:41:53,461
You saw what you needed to see
in order to make you believe.

380
00:41:53,533 --> 00:41:56,366
Well, then what about
this boy?

381
00:41:56,436 --> 00:41:59,428
This boy with cancer?
You can't deny that.

382
00:41:59,505 --> 00:42:02,099
That's...
That's undeniable proof.

383
00:42:02,175 --> 00:42:04,609
Even if we could convince his parents
to let us march him out,

384
00:42:04,677 --> 00:42:08,443
how long before that chip in his neck
mysteriously disappears?

385
00:42:08,514 --> 00:42:12,143
This was the perfectly
executed con, Scully.

386
00:42:12,218 --> 00:42:15,051
And the only thing I can't figure out
is why you're still alive.

387
00:42:16,556 --> 00:42:18,854
Mulder,
I looked into his eyes.

388
00:42:20,793 --> 00:42:23,193
I swear what he told me
was true.

389
00:42:33,673 --> 00:42:36,073
The man's motives
never changed.

390
00:42:36,142 --> 00:42:38,610
You think
he used me to save himself...

391
00:42:38,678 --> 00:42:41,238
at the expense
of the human race?

392
00:42:41,314 --> 00:42:45,216
He knows what that
science is worth, how powerful it is.

393
00:42:45,284 --> 00:42:47,718
He'd let nothing
stand in his way.

394
00:42:47,787 --> 00:42:49,982
You may be right.

395
00:42:50,056 --> 00:42:53,116
But for a moment,
I saw something else in him.

396
00:42:53,192 --> 00:42:55,752
A longing for something
more than power.

397
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:59,396
Maybe for something
he could never have.
