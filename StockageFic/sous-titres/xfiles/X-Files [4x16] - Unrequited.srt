00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,400
[Man] That many of you
here tonight came home...

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,720
not to a hero's welcome but to
the hostility of the American people...

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,880
is shameful fact of history.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,360
One that I will never
understand or forgive.

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,080
But it also underscores
our sacred duty--

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,440
not just today, but forever--

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,280
to honor those
who served with honor...

8
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,720
and to remember those who fell:

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,160
men and women whose
ultimate sacrifice...

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,080
must never be forgotten.

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,000
There is probably no audience...

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,840
that understands better
that our freedom is not free.

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,680
All right, you're my eyes out there.
Talk to me. Positions report.

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,400
Sector three clear.

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,960
No sign of him in four.

16
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,480
Sector six, report.

17
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,320
[General]
It is our duty to remember them.

[Skinner]

19
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,960
- He's here. I feel him.
- Then where is he?

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,840
Hold on. I think
I have him in section four.

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,200
Can you confirm that, Scully?

22
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,720
[General Continues, Indistinct]

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,000

He's heading toward you, three.

24
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,760
Positions hold. Three and four,
do you have eye contact?

25
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,880
I have him in three.
He's coming toward you, Scully.

26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,480
[Mulder]
Don't take your eyes off him, Scully.

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,120
Mulder, he saw me.

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,240
He's heading toward the sound booth.

29
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,160
Copy that.
I'm cutting him off.

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,520
Talk to me, people.
Does anybody have him?

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,680
This memorial is a place where
we can thank those men and women-

32
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,880
What's happening, Scully?

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,280
[Scully]
I'm closing on him.

34
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,920
- Do you have him in three?
-[Man]Negative.

35
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,040
[General]I’m always struck
by something as I walk through--

36
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,880
[Skinner]
Scully? Scully!

37
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,520
I lost him.
You got him, three?

38
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,240
[Man]
I don't see him, Scully.

[Skinner]
What's happening, Agent Scully?

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,480
- I can't see him anywhere.
- He must be headed your way.

41
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,400
- [ Scully] You got him, Mulder?
- Not yet.

42
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,040
I got him.

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,520
I lost him.

44
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,040
Pick him up, Mulder.
He's right in front of you.

45
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,440
- He's got a gun!
- General, get off the stage!

46
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,880
I can't see him.
I can't see him!

[ Shouting ]

48
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,680
Good morning, sir.

49
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,880
All right! Let's go!

Lieutenant General? Sir?

54
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,120
[Skinner]Lieutenant General
Peter MacDougal was shot dead...

55
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,720
at extreme close range
at0600 this morning.

56
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,040
FBI Forensics reports
the wound was not self-inflicted.

57
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,080
The murder weapon
has not been recovered.

58
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,960
The general's driver,
Private First Class Gus Burkholder,

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
is currently being held
on suspicion of murder.

60
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,160
It says here N.A.A. tests confirm
the private did not do the shooting.

61
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,160
There is suspicion of an accomplice,

62
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,840
based on the one piece of evidence
found at the crime scene,

63
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,120
a so-called death card used by soldiers
in Vietnam to mark their kills...

64
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,920
and by Private Burkholder's possible
ties to a radical paramilitary group...

65
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,640
called the Right Hand, whose
stated aim is violent revolution.

66
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,680
After speaking with General Bloch,

67
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,600
he believes we have a high probability
of opportunity for a group like this,

68
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,600
a unique situation that could result
in the very public loss of lives.

69
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,600
Dozens of high-ranking military
officials are in Washington today...

70
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,400
for a rededication of
the Vietnam Veterans War Memorial.

71
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,680
Unless we can determine
a clear motive,

72
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,680
we will consider
any one of them to be a target.

73
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,400
What if Private Burkholder is telling
the truth, that he's innocent?

74
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,680
Until we can find another suspect,
the FBI will pursue the Right Hand...

75
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,000
and their leader, an ex-Marine
named Denny Markham,

76
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,200
in a preemptive strategy to put a stop
to any other plans they may have made.

77
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,760
You all have Markham's file
in front of you.

78
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,640
For obvious reasons, our strategy
includes keeping this from the media.

79
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,880
You’ll be working in teams of two.
If you encounter any resistance,

80
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,880
do not engage.

81
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,200
Surveil and call for backup.

82
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,640
Agent Chandler has your assignments
and field warrants.

83
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,640
We have less than 1 2 hours
to prevent...

84
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,320
any further execution
or loss of life, understood?

85
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,800
All right, Beckwith and Fontana,
you’re going to Virginia Beach.

86
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,840
Jackson and Miller,
you're going to Alexandria.

87
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,080
Was that for the benefit of the general,
or have you been able...

88
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,800
to develop a real strategy?

89
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,400
Right now I'm flyin'
by the seat of my pants.

90
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,720
You mean there's no procedure outlined
for an invisible assassin?

91
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,560
Did you talk to Private Burkholder?

92
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,960
I interviewed him and convinced him
to take a polygraph test.

93
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,480
- And?
- He passed.

94
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,920
The nature of his claims
would suggest a false positive.

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,040
The tester admitted that
the results are highly interpretive.

96
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,400
You heard his story?

97
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,480
I found his story compelling,
personally,

98
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,200
but then again, I believed
the Warren Commission.

99
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,360
If I have to devise a strategy around
that story, then there is no strategy.

100
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,080
Somebody killed the general, which
means somebody isn't telling the truth.

101
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,360
The man who heads the Right Hand,
Markham?

102
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,040
Do you have a warrant for him?

103
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,720
- Yes, why?
- Let Mulder and I serve it.

104
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,760
One misstep and Markham
smells a shakedown.

105
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,520
He's going to disappear, or find
another way to push the button.

106
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,720
And I've already seen more
dead soldiers than I ever want to see.

- Am I under suspicion?
- No, but your group is,

118
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,360
Is that a name I should know?

119
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,680
He's on the mailing list
for the Right Hand.

120

I can't keep track of every one of'em.

- December, 1 995,

just a few hours after
the Right Hand liberated him...

156
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,880
from a P.O.W. camp
just outside the U Minh Forest.

157

I'm sure you’re aware in 1 973
the Defense Department...

determined there were
no more P.O.W.'s in Vietnam.

159
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,240
Maybe that's why they tried
to kidnap Sergeant Teager...

00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,840
when we brought him home.

161
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,840

Had their commandos
board our plane in San Diego.

164
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,200
When they broke into the cargo hold
where we hid him, he was already gone.

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,560
But what if he’s telling the truth?

169
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,640
A phantom P.O.W. left for dead
comes back to avenge the injustices?

170
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,600
- Maybe the war ain't over.
- Maybe not Denny Markham's war.

171
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,600
Given the facts of the case, and
Private Burkholder's polygraph test,

172
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,720
it's the closest thing
to an explanation that we've got.

173
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,800
Or it’s just a clever story
being proffered as a cover-up...

174
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,240
for what is actually
an elaborately orchestrated conspiracy.

175
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,800
There is that possibility too.

176
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,040
Let Markham take the polygraph.

177
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,840
- And what if he passes?
- He won't.

178
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,080
[Man]
Mrs. Davenport?

179
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,280
- Renee Davenport?
- Yes?

180
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,840
Wife of Lance Corporal Gary Davenport
of the Special Forces?

181
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,360
Yes. I'm sorry. Do I know you?

182
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,760
No, ma'am.
I've come to act on his behalf...

183
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,320
for the reason that Gary
remains a prisoner of war.

184
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,880
Gary's dead.

185
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,280
No, ma'am.

186
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,600
May you forgive me as you
forgive him, as a man and a soldier,

187
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,560
for restoring the honor
and memory of the B-1 1 .

188
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,360
Oh, my God.

189
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,880
Where did you get these?

190
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,840
Who gave you these?

191
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,040
Hey, where are you?

192
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,960
Oh, my God. Where are you?
Where'd you go?

193
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,960
Give me the next one.

194
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,040
Is it true she made a positive I.D.
from the photo?

195
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,520
[Skinner]From a bad fax of it.
Do you have the photo with you?

196
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,520
Yeah, and more copies to distribute.

197
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,520
We have event security checking out
all vendors and workmen.

198
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,040
We've got it out
to local law enforcement,

199
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,680
but not to the exclusion
of the other suspects.

200
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,280
I thought she I.D.'d Teager.

201
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,960
She did, but I cannot authorize
a strategy that's gonna target...

202
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,640
a soldier who’s officially dead.

203
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,520
Because his name is on a wall?

204
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
No, because I just got off the phone
with the army forensics lab...

205
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,680
where Sergeant Nathaniel Teager's
remains have been stored...

206
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,680
since they were recovered
from the crash site.

207
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,320
They have his remains?

208
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,440
Markham may have staged
this whole thing,

209
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,080
finding somebody vulnerable
like her to pass off his lies.

210
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,640
- Why go to all that trouble?
- To create a decoy?

211
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,360
To divert our attention?
Which seems to be working.

212
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,000
This woman saw someone.
I want to know who.

213
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,520
Yes, that's him.

214
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,480
You're sure?

215
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,960
Everything he said made it sound
like Gary was still alive.

216
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,240
But that can't be true, can it?

217
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,880
You say he just disappeared?

218
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,920
That's what's so strange.

219
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,720
One minute he's standing right
in front of me, and then he's gone.

220
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,880
What if he was telling the truth?

221
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,120
What if Gary is alive?

222
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,560
I've tried to get on with my life.
I've remarried.

223
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,680
What am I supposed
to tell my husband now?

224
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,560
What am I supposed to do?

225
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,880
Oh, your eye.

226
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:32,120
What? Oh, my God.
What's happening to me?

227
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,160
I think you just burst a capillary.

228
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
- Oh, my God.
- Scully?

229
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,480
Hold a tissue there.

230
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,040
Can we get Mrs. Davenport an eye exam?

231
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,240
An eye exam? For what?

232
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,240
By all accounts, the man
we're looking for, the man she saw,

233
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,840
has a knack for
vanishing in plain sight.

234
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,840
Maybe there's a connection.

235
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,720
She has a simple subconjunctival
hemorrhage, probably brought on
by her emotional state.

236
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,960
And how did she reach
that emotional state?

237
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,800
What about you?
What are you gonna do?

238
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,800
I'm gonna see
if we’re really chasing a dead man.

239
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,240
- Agent Mulder?
- Yes.

240
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,280
Dr. Benjamin Keyser. I think I located
what you’re looking for.

241
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,400
It's a small miracle
I found it, actually.

242
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,400
The record had been
partially destroyed.

243
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,320
Two bicuspids and a molar.

244
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,880
This is all that was left
of Teager at the crash site?

245
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,120
I've seen findings made with far less.
These are Sergeant Teager's teeth.

246
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,440
I cross-checked them
with his dental records.

247
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,600
Is there anyway to tell
how the teeth were extracted?

248
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,760
I would assume they were pulled.

249
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:48,760
On each of these teeth, there's
a pronounced scoring in the enamel.

250
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,280
Here. See for yourself.

251
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,760
Can you tell if that was
pre- or postmortem?

252
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,800
No, not really.

253
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,840
Then this is presumptive, isn't it?

254
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,240
A finding of death
based on inconclusive evidence.

255
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,880
It was noted here, even underlined.
"Inconclusive."

256
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,480
Whoever signed off on this death
chose to ignore the facts.

257
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,920
I couldn't tell you who that was.
These records were partially destroyed.

258
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,520
Is there any other
way to tell?

259
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,200
Based on the records and the reports
filed at the same time,

260
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,640
we could make
a pretty good guess.

261
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,560
- [phone Ringing]
- Yes?

262
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,640
Yes, just a moment.
It's for you, sir.

263
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,280
Hello?

264
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,360
General Steffan, this is
Special Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI.

265
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,720
I'm calling because we have reason
to believe your life may be in danger.

266
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,000
What are you talking about?

267
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,640
The person or persons responsible
for the murder of General MacDougal...

268
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,920
this morning may have chosen
to target you.

269
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,920
Based on what information?

270
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Based on a death certificate
you may have put your signature on,

271
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,240
the death certificate
for Sergeant Nathaniel Teager.

272
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,240
I don't know anything about that,
but I'm on my way to the Pentagon now.

273
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,240
I'm ten minutes away.

274
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,680
I'm gonna have to ask you to trust
my risk assessment on this,

275
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,600
and take every caution.

276
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,800
Right.

277
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,040
Do you know your driver, sir?

278
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,400
Yes, he drives me all the time.

279
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,600
Good. I'm going to put two FBI agents
there to escort you, as a precaution.

280
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,000
They have my mobile
phone number, okay?

281
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,960
[ Beeps ]

282
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,080
How many of you know
what a pentagon is?

283
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,120
No? A pentagon
is a shape with five sides.

284
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,520
And the pentagon is just that.

285
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,640
We’re standing right now
in section 'A. "

286
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,440
Built in 1 941
through an act of Congress,

287
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:46,360
the pentagon is virtually
a city in itself.

288
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,640
- General, sir.
- Good afternoon.

289
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,960
Thanks.

290
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,360
[ Alarm Buzzes ]

291
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,360
All clear, General.

292
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,240
Thank you, gentlemen.
That will be all.

293
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,200
[Door Closes]

294
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,360
[ Beeps ]
Mulder.

295
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,680
I'm at
the Georgetown medical center.

296
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,680
Did you find out what caused
her eye to hemorrhage?

297
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,520
No, but the ophthalmologist
discovered something called
a transient scotoma.

298
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,400
- Scotoma?
- A floating blind spot.

299
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,680
What would cause that?

300
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,160
Any number of diseases
can scar the retina.

301
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,720
Diabetes, glaucoma,
macular degeneration.

302
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,280
In turn they create
a visual field deficit.

303
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,720
[ Alarm Buzzes ]

304
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,200
- Does she have any of those diseases?
- It doesn't appear so.

305
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,600
Don’t you think
it's odd she'd have a blind spot
she wouldn't have noticed? Thanks.

306
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,720
Not necessarily.

307
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
The processes of the brain fill in,

308
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,400
and the visual cortex
compensates conceptually.

309
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,600
That might account
for Teager's vanishing.

310
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,480
I asked the doctor that
and he laughed at me.

311
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,560
- [ Beeps ]
- Hold on, Scully.

312
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
- [Beeps]
- It's Mulder.

Agent Mulder,
this is General Steffan.

314
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,800
I found something on my desk,
something very troubling.

315
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,200
- Where are you?
- In my office.

316
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,520
The agents I assigned to you.
Are they with you?

317
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,240
No, no, they’re just outside.

318
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,800
I want you to call them
into your office now, General.

319
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,920
Who put this here?

320
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,440
Listen carefully.
I'm on my way there.

321
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,600
- [ Gunshot ]
- General Steffan? General Steffan?

322
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,880
Call an ambulance.

[Chattering]

325
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,720
The general's secretary had been
in here organizing his desk...

326
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,160
no more than 1 5 minutes
before the general was shot.

327
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,400
He never saw this card, and he never saw
anyone go in and out of the office...

328
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,400
aside from the general
and the agents assigned to him.

329
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,080
From my cursory exam, nothing about
the general can explain your narrative.

330
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,400
I was on the phone with the man. He was
shot at close range in the forehead.

331
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,440
He would have seen the shooter.

332
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,440
Not necessarily. He could have turned
and been surprised.

333
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,000
There's far too little
forensic evidence yet to know.

334
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,080
No scotoma?

335
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,760
That's beyond my capabilities here
to make that kind of analysis.

336
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,760
It's beyond all our capabilities,
but somebody's got to explain...

337
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,960
how a four-star general could be shot
and killed in what is symbolically...

338
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,640
the best-guarded
military base in the country.

339
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:14,080
- Sir?
- I need both of you out here
to see something... now.

340
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,800
That’s him. That's Teager.

341
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,320
Whoever it is, I want to know
how the hell this happened.

342
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,040
Neither of us has
a clear explanation, sir.

343
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,200
You were on your way here.
You knew the general was in danger.

344
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,320
I did everything I could.
I put two agents with him.

345
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,480
- This is insanity.
This man is killing at will.
- That's correct, sir.

346
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,720
- He's unstoppable?
-I think Teager has an ability--

347
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,960
the ability to effectively
erase himself from the visual field.

348
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,240
If he’s invisible, then why is
he on this video clear as day?

349
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,240
I think that he can hide
himself from human sight...

350
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,680
by manipulating something
Scully has referred to...

351
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,400
as naturally occurring,
a blind spot.

352
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,240
That is conjecture, sir.

353
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,920
- Even when looking at him?
- You might not be able to see him.

354
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,120
Isn’t it true
U.S. soldiers reported...

355
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,560
the unexplained appearance
and disappearance of V.C. guerrillas?

356
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,720
I've read the dispatches myself.

357
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,480
Maybe Teager learned something from
his captors in 25 years of isolation.

358
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,760
We've got four miles of crowded streets
where 31 military officers...

359
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,560
are staging for a parade
into Freedom Square.

360
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,960
If what you're saying has any
truth to it, I can't protect these men.

361
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,080
- Call it off.
- Parade or no parade,
those men are vulnerable.

362
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,640
- The only way to stop this killer
is to catch him.
- How?

363
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,280
By finding his next victim
before he does.

364
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,640
I am Major General
Benjamin Bloch.

365
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,680
He did it again, didn't he?

366
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,080
I told them he would.

367
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,040
According to the FBI, you know
the man they're looking for.

368
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,840
Maybe you can tell me
why they can't seem to find him.

369
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,120
The same reason you can't,

370
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,000
which I imagine is the same
reason you're here right now.

371
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,200
I am here because
people are dying--

372
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,760
soldiers who dedicated their lives
to the defense of this country.

373
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,080
I guess that's one way
of looking' at it.

374
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,840
As it stands, you are facing
charges of conspiracy...

375
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,360
to commit homicide and treason.

376
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,120
But if both those fall through, there is
still enough evidence to convict you...

377
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,200
for possession and
transport of illegal arms.

378
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,520
Are you threatening me?

379
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:58,360
No, I am offering you a deal...

380
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,440
for you and the people
you represent.

381
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,400
If you think I've got any sway
with Teager, you're mistaken.

382
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,640
I just need to know
what he wants.

383
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,000
You know what he wants, and we
both know you can't give it to him,

384
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,600
not without dragging that nice, clean
uniform of yours through the mud.

385
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,320
not without dragging that nice, clean
uniform of yours through the mud.

386
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,360
Whatever you do to me
won't change his mind, General.

387
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,160
He's sending a message...

388
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,320
and makin' damn sure
everyone hears it loud and clear.

389
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,120
Band! Band! Time!

390
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,080
[ Chattering ]

391
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,800
Driver, prepare to move them out.

392
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,840
Yes, sir!

393
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,440
[Man]I’m after you.
All right, move them out.

394
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,400
You told me
you were in a rush.

395
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,480
Cross town traffic's all snarled up
because of the parade.

396
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,120
You need information
on American prisoners of war.

397
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,280
- A man named Teager.
- I have no information on him.

398
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,440
- Then why did you come here?
- Tell me what you know.

399
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,200
A P.O.W. named Teager may be back
home carrying out death sentences...

400
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,320
against the men that
left him in Vietnam.

401
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,600
- Who are those men?
- Generals.

402
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,480
- Steffan and MacDougal.
- They have a connection.

403
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,840
What is that?

404
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,280
A recent news story extremely
embarrassing to the U.S. military...

405
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,840
about the disposing
of South Vietnamese soldiers.

406
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,880
Men employed by our government
as spies and commandoes...

407
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,160
and then left behind enemy lines
to certain capture and death.

408
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,080
The operation was disavowed, and their
lives were erased from the records.

409
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,240
By a secret three-man commission
who may now be facing charges,

410
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,720
whose testimonies might be used
in the calculation of reparations.

411
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:42,160
Are you saying that our government
wants these officers dead?

412
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,480
Why would they ask us
to protect them?

413
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,400
Because they know you can't.

414
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,560
Well, who's the third man?
I need a name.

415
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,320
- [ Scully] General Bloch!
- General, sir! Stop the car!

416
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,320
What's going on here?

417
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,760
We need you to get out
of the car, sir, for your own safety.

418
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,200
- Why?
- We received information
your life might be in danger.

419
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,520
From who?

420
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,880
Shooter! Get down!

421
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,960
- Where? Where is he?
- He was there.

422
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,800
I saw him. I--

423
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,240
It was him, sir.
It was the man in the photo.

424
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,040
Are you sure?

425
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,600
I saw him, sir.
It was him.

426
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,680
Are you sure?

427
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,920
Hut! Mount!

428
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,360
Call when you find out.

429
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,240
Scully. I heard what happened.

430
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,760
They told me you saved
General Bloch's life.

431
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,240
He's doing all right.
He's over there.

432
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,880
They told me you saw somebody
on the parade route?

433
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,320
I'm not really sure.

434
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,760
You saw him, didn’t you?
You saw Teager.

435
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,440
I told you I'm not sure.

436
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,560
But you drew your gun. You must have
been a little more convinced than that.

437
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,600
How are you so convinced that
General Bloch was his next target?

438
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,040
I found out about General Bloch
from the same person...

439
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,320
who told me we were never meant to
save Bloch's life, or the other generals.

440
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,880
- What are you talking about?
- This case.

441
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,520
Why do you think it was
dumped in your lap,

442
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,480
unless heading up
an antiterrorism detail...

443
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,200
is all of a sudden part of your job?

444
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,800
- That doesn't prove he was set up.
- They knew about Teager.

445
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,680
They've known that he'd be
unstoppable from the beginning.

446
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,040
They wanted Skinner to fail?

447
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,920
And us. Given the nature of the case,
they knew you’d bring us in.

448
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,600
The government is not
about to sacrifice...

449
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,800
the lives of ranking military officers
just to discredit us.

450
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,200
Discrediting us, in this case,
in only secondary.

451
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,120
Secondary to what?

452
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,080
To maintaining their secret
policy of denial about P.O.W.'s,

453
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,640
which required silencing
the men who made that policy.

454
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,520
Markham's story is having its intended
effect. You're buying into the lie.

455
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,320
Markham may be the only man
in this case who's telling the truth.

456
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,920
If you don't believe me,
ask General Bloch.

457
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,680
Ask me what?
I can't wait here any longer.

458
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,600
I'm delivering the keynote address
in five minutes.

459
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,320
You might want to reconsider.

460
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,920
He won’t reconsider. Not going out
would be an admission of guilt.

461
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,160
We still have reason
to believe your life is in danger.

462
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,400
It's your job
to protect me still, isn't it?

463
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,080
- That's what we're trying to do.
- Then do your job.

464
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,600
General!

465
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,120
All right, people, listen up,
because we don't have much time.

466
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,720
You all know your responsibilities.
You have your sectors and assignments.

467
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,600
[Woman]It gives me great pleasure
to introduce a very special man.

468
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,680
Wounded and decorated for gallantry
in Vietnam, he had an idea,

469
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,680
- Teager?
- a vision...

470
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,040
to create a national memorial...

471
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,080
Hey, man, is that you?

472
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,200
for all Americans who gave
their lives in the Vietnam war.

473
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,680
Where ya goin'?

474
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,480
- Ladies and gentlemen,
it is with great pride...
-Hey!

475
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,080
- Where ya goin'?
- that I give you the founder...

476
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,760
of the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial Fund,

477
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,480
Mr. Jan Scruggs.

478
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,360
- Teager?
-[Scruggs]
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

479
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,120
We are here to rededicate...

480
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,240
this memorial on this important day.

481
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:23,200
We especially remember those
who cannot share this day with us,

482
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,520
- the soldiers, the airmen, the sailors.
- Hey, Teager!

483
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,800
It's me, Leo Danzinger.

484
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,520
I saw you, man.
Where are ya?

485
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,840
Behind ya.

486
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,960
I-- I thought you were dead.

487
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,160
That's what they told us.

488
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,200
'Cause that's what
they wanted you to believe.

489
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,320
- I don't understand.
- You will... after tonight.

490
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,280
What are you talkin' about?

491
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,680
I waited for them, Leo.
I waited for them to come.

492
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,080
But they never came.

493
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,720
- Maybe they didn't know.
- They knew.

494
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,560
They just figured letting me die off
was easier than admitting the truth.

495
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,560
It's all over, Teager.

496
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,600
It’s been over
for a long time now.

497
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,600
Not for me, not for the others.

498
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,440
You're tellin' me there's more?

00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,480
[paper Rustles]

500
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,920
What are you doin', man?

501
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,320
Where are ya?

502
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,000
Where are ya?

503
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,320
[Man]It is a distinct honor
to present to you now...

504
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,960
another great American
and a brother in arms.

505
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,080
Major General Benjamin Bloch.

[Crowd Cheering]

507
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:28,480
Admiral Leitch,
Senator Baine,

508
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,600
fellow Americans...

509
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,160
and especially the veterans.

510
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,400
There is probably no audience
that understands better...

511
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,760
that our freedom is not free.

512
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,280
All right, you're my eyes out there.
Talk to me. Positions report.

513
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,920
We owe that freedom
to the selfless sacrifice...

514
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,960
Sector three clear.

515
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,520
-to those whose names are on this wall.
-No sign of him in four.

516
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,800
And for that, it is our duty
to remember them.

517
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,800
Hold on. I think
I have him in section four.

518
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,160
Can you confirm that, Scully?

519
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,800
[Bloch]
Their sweat, their long hours,

520
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,640
their blood.

521
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,960
Positive I.D.
He's heading toward you, three.

522
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,640
Positions hold. Three and four,
do you have eye contact?

523
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,680
I have him in three.
He's coming toward you, Scully.

524
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,200
[Mulder]Don't take
your eyes off him, Scully.

525
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,560
[Bloch]Not for themselves,
but for their country.

526
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,840
Mulder, he saw me.

527
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,000
He's heading toward the sound booth.

528
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,920
Copy that.
I'm cutting him off.

529
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,240
Talk to me, people.
Does anybody have him?

530
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,320
...when they were in Vietnam.

531
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,440
This memorial...

532
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,920
What's happening, Scully?

533
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,640
is a place where we can
come and thank those--

534
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,040
[Scully]
I'm closing on him.

535
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,960
- Do you have him in three?
- [ Man ] Negative.

536
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,000
[Skinner]
Scully?

537
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,400
- Scully!
- I lost him. You got him, three?

538
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,280
[Man]
I don’t see him, Scully.

539
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,320
[Skinner]
What’s happening, Agent Scully?

540
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,360
- I can't see him anywhere.
- He must be headed your way.

541
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,600
- [ Scully] You got him, Mulder?
- Not yet.

542
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,280
I got him.

543
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,720
I lost him.

544
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,280
Pick him up, Mulder.
He's right in front of you.

545
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,720
- He's got a gun!
- General, get off the stage!

546
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,400
[Woman]
What's going on?

547
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,200
- [ Mulder] Can't see him.
- Mulder!

548
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,320
- Mulder--
- I saw him out of the corner of my eye.

549
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,800
He's gone. He's gone.

550
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,080
[Man] There’s no cause
for alarm, ladies and gentlemen.

551
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,760
Just a minor disturbance.
Let's try and keep some order.

552
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,800
- Where's General Bloch?
- He's with Skinner.

553
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,600
- We gotta stop 'em.
- What's going on here?

554
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,880
I think he can only hide himself
in somebody's direct line of sight.

555
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,920
- When looking directly at him?
- That's why he killed...

556
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,360
MacDougal and Steffan
at close quarters.

557
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,920
MacDougal in his car
and Steffan in his office.

558
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,400
Get away from the car.
He's in the car. Teager's in the car.

559
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,920
Get down!

561
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,760
Come out with both
your hands in the air!

562
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,200
[Mulder]
It's over, Teager. Come on out.

563
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,360
[Engine Starts]

564
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,200
Get an ambulance over here!

565
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,760
Ow!

00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,000

Detachment B-1 1 .

572
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,720
Service number 82278.

573
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,200
Teager, Nathaniel Jr.

574
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,720
March 7, 1952.

575
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,840
Teager--

576
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,400
The Pentagon is claiming that the man
who was killed was a Thomas Lynch.

577
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,920
He's a vet who's been in and out...

578
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
of V.A. psychiatric hospitals
for the last 1 5 years.

579
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,120
And a sometime member
of the Right Hand.

580
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,480
His name was on
Denny Markham's mailing list.

581
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,240
- Markham made a positive I.D.
- They must have gotten to him.

582
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,560
Army Forensics claims to
have multiple confirmation.

583
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,320
You heard him! We both did.
It's happening all over again.

584
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,320
They're covering the lies with more
lies, trying to make him invisible.

585
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,960
We've got to subpoena
Markham and General Bloch,

586
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,400
and we've got to petition the State
Department to release Teager's body.

587
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,840
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

588
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,400
This investigation has been
turned over to C.I.D.

589
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,000
- It's no longer our jurisdiction.
- Don't let them do this.

590
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,760
- Let it go. You did your job.
- So did Nathaniel Teager.

591
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,880
You found the man you were looking
for, but now he's dead. It's over.

592
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,400
Is that what you believe?

593
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,240
Is that what you really believe?

594
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:24,280
They're not just denying this
man's life. They're denying his death.

595
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,000
And with all due respect, sir,
he could be you.
