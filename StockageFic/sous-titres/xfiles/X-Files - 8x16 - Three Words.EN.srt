1
00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:42,451
( panting )

2
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:44,047
MAN: Stop right there!

3
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:46,684
- Freeze.
-Freeze! Put your hands in the air!

4
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,819
I need to tell the President something.

5
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:51,728
I need to tell... I need to tell
the President something.

6
00:00:51,798 --> 00:00:53,129
GUARD: Get down on the ground.

7
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,325
I need to see the President.
He needs to know.

8
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,635
Look, he needs to know.

9
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:03,871
Aliens-- Aliens-- they're taking over
the United States.

10
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:08,404
- He needs to know.
- GUARD 1: He's got a weapon.

11
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:10,143
Get the weapon! Get the weapon!

12
00:01:10,384 --> 00:01:12,579
He's shot. He shot himself.

13
00:01:12,652 --> 00:01:16,554
Damn it. Stupid son of a bitch.
What was he thinking?

14
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,583
-MAN: Get a medic!
-MAN #2: Get a medic!

15
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,857
Please, the President...

16
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:40,439
( screaming )

17
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,050
( screaming )

18
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:01,125
Mulder, are you okay?

19
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:04,663
Yeah.

20
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:07,666
For a guy who was, uh...

21
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:10,726
in a coffiin not too long ago I
think I'm doing pretty damn good.

22
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:16,798
I don't quite have my legs
under me...yet.

23
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:21,878
Well, you might want to
consider sitting down

24
00:03:21,915 --> 00:03:24,782
when you hear what we have to tell you.

25
00:03:25,952 --> 00:03:28,614
Uh-oh.

26
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:31,054
Now, it's, uh...

27
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:32,785
it's good news.

28
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:35,589
It's... it's miraculous news.

29
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:40,690
I can't possibly exaggerate the
inconceivability of you sitting here.

30
00:03:42,936 --> 00:03:44,164
Let's be honest...

31
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:46,865
your condition may be more
incredible than your recovery.

32
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:51,635
Whatever neurological disorder
you were suffering from

33
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:53,804
it's no longer detectable.

34
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,281
After a course of
transfusions and antivirals

35
00:03:57,517 --> 00:04:01,647
it has rid your body of the virus
that was invading it.

36
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:04,656
The scars on your face

37
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:06,248
on your hands, on your feet,
on your chest

38
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:10,695
they, they seem to be
repairing themselves.

39
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:13,892
Mulder, you are in perfect health.

40
00:04:16,236 --> 00:04:18,966
Wow.

41
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:21,974
How do you feel Agent Mulder?

42
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:25,171
Like Austin Powers.

43
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:27,577
( chuckles )

44
00:04:44,264 --> 00:04:46,232
Must feel good to be home.

45
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:07,276
Something looks different.

46
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:12,224
- It's clean.
- ( chuckles )

47
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:16,023
Ah... that's it.

48
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:23,897
Missing Molly.

49
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,200
Yeah.

50
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:29,935
She wasn't as lucky as you.

51
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:38,274
Mulder...

52
00:05:41,655 --> 00:05:46,683
I don't know if you'll ever
understand what it was like.

53
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:52,698
First learning of your abduction...

54
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:56,133
and then searching for you
and fiinding you dead.

55
00:05:58,638 --> 00:06:01,903
And now to have you back and, uh...

56
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:05,208
Well, you act like you're surprised.

57
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:06,836
( chuckles )

58
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,445
I prayed a lot.

59
00:06:16,322 --> 00:06:19,120
And my prayers have been answered.

60
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:23,026
In more ways than one.

61
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:24,927
Yeah.

62
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:29,865
I'm happy for you.

63
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:31,995
I think I know...

64
00:06:32,072 --> 00:06:34,734
how much that means to you.

65
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,944
- Mulder--
- I'm sorry.

66
00:06:46,986 --> 00:06:48,954
I don't mean to be cold or ungrateful.

67
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:53,015
I just... I have no idea where I fiit in.

68
00:06:53,093 --> 00:06:55,118
Right now.

69
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:59,829
I just, uh...

70
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:05,303
I'm having a little trouble...
processing... everything.

71
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:19,910
It's Marion the Librarian, boys.

72
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:24,519
I got the new Harry Potter.

73
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:26,726
( laughing )

74
00:07:38,304 --> 00:07:41,865
Our Lord and Savior. For you.

75
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:44,034
I've got my books.

76
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,136
Expand your horizons.

77
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:51,377
I know all I need to know.

78
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:53,385
Want to bet?

79
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:04,853
Put a rise in your Levi's.

80
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:29,923
REPORTER: 
Again, our top story is
the death of a man

81
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:30,548
REPORTER: 
Again, our top story is
the death of a man

82
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,489
who jumped the fence at the White House
last evening his name now released.

83
00:08:35,562 --> 00:08:39,862
Howard Salt, a federal employee
working on the U.S. Census

84
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,835
got as far as the White House
front door yesterday where
he was stopped by security

85
00:08:43,903 --> 00:08:45,370
and shot accidentally by his own gun.

86
00:08:45,438 --> 00:08:47,429
According to a Secret Service spokesman

87
00:08:47,507 --> 00:08:50,533
Salt appeared to be
irrational and resisted arrest

88
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,875
shouting unspecifiied grievances
against the U.S. Government

89
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:56,541
and demanding to speak
with the President.

90
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:59,881
Coworkers describe him
as likable and hardworking.

91
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:02,080
We never see them coming.

92
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:07,081
People are so rarely what they seem.

93
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,151
Gentlemen

94
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:11,060
please, sit down.

95
00:09:19,072 --> 00:09:23,634
An application was submitted
to me this morning by Agent Scully

96
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:28,246
on behalf of our old friend,
Fox Mulder, for reinstatement.

97
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:31,011
I assume you both know about this.

98
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:34,178
- Reinstatement?
- To the X-Files.

99
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:35,983
I thought Mulder just went home.

100
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:39,183
Well, somebody's very anxious
for him to get back to work.

101
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:42,854
I wanted you both to see this
before I deny the application.

102
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:44,453
What is it?

103
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,863
It's a review of the success
rate of your X-Files

104
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:50,232
since Agent Doggett joined the team.

105
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:53,272
-Damn impressive,John.
- Impressive, sir?

106
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,968
The only thing impressive
about my work on the X-Files

107
00:09:58,044 --> 00:10:00,410
is that I even know what's
going on half the time.

108
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,108
From this report, you and Agent Scully
have had more arrests on percentage

109
00:10:03,182 --> 00:10:05,673
than she and Mulder over seven years.

110
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:09,252
- Take a look.
- That's not very fair to Agent Mulder.

111
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:11,256
So many of his cases involve...

112
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:13,622
Aliens?

113
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:17,185
There lies the problem.

114
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:22,031
The F.B.I. isn't a place
for personal crusades.

115
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:27,700
I'm asking you both
to make that understood

116
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:29,704
on my behalf.

117
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:32,912
Well, you can't ask me to tell
Mulder he's off the X-Files.

118
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:34,311
It's his unit. He created it.

119
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,541
I'm not asking you,John.

120
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:48,252
You sent me to fiind Mulder. I found him.

121
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:50,489
Don't charge me with driving
a stake through his heart.

122
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:54,499
Maybe you'd rather I close the X-Files.

123
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:57,058
Then we'd both be getting what we want.

124
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:03,038
Let's go, Agent Doggett.

125
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,648
Now.

126
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:15,487
Kersh wants to put me behind a desk?

127
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:18,490
That is not what Kersh wants.

128
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:22,187
No, I think Kersh wants
you to quit, Mulder.

129
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:26,027
It's more than that.
He wants to punish you, to hurt you.

130
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:28,192
And you by putting you in this position.

131
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:30,997
And Agent Scully,
for not giving up on me.

132
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:34,768
Truth is, this is a bullet that
was fiired about eight years ago.

133
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:36,999
It's a magic bullet that's been
going round and round

134
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:40,375
and right now it seems poised to
hit me right in the back of the head.

135
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:43,143
I think the question is, are we going to
sit here and let this happen?

136
00:11:43,216 --> 00:11:46,583
Scully, you're going to give
birth in a couple months.

137
00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:49,712
You can talk as tough as you like
but you know and I know and they know

138
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:52,553
that in a little while you're going
to have more important things

139
00:11:52,592 --> 00:11:54,651
than whether or not
the X-Files remains open.

140
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:58,458
They're not closing the X-Files.
Kersh aims to keep them open
withAgent Doggett running them.

141
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:00,158
Agent who?

142
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:05,034
I've had a partner for
the last several months.

143
00:12:05,104 --> 00:12:08,232
He was assigned to help me fiind you.

144
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:11,573
Mission accomplished.

145
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:15,172
Does he know what he's
doing at all, this guy?

146
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:17,216
About the paranormal? Not much.

147
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:21,413
I see. Then maybe the question is not
who fiired this magic bullet

148
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:24,456
but whether or not it was a lone gunman.

149
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:27,254
Agent Doggett is above reproach, Mulder.

150
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:29,624
He's being maneuvered just like you.

151
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:33,189
Well, good. At least he's maneuverable.

152
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:37,327
Where are you going?

153
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:41,362
Going to get dressed. For the fiirst time
I feel like getting back to work.

154
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:40,323
- ( horn honking )
- Wrap it up and fall in.

155
00:13:47,673 --> 00:13:49,800
GUARD: Stay in line.

156
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:53,345
Let's go.

157
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:57,172
- Get back in line--
- Hey,you! ( yelling )

158
00:13:57,216 --> 00:14:00,413
( cheering )

159
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:02,477
Go get that son of a bitch.

160
00:14:04,524 --> 00:14:05,752
Nobody move!

161
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:15,862
Stand down!

162
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,877
( train horn blowing )

163
00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:34,243
( gun cocks )

164
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:48,921
Get over here. Over here now.

165
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:51,930
Come on, sit down.
Hands behind your back.

166
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:55,559
Head down. Down between your legs.

167
00:15:58,271 --> 00:16:00,967
Absalom. That's your name, right?
What are you looking at?

168
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,974
The back of your neck.

169
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,713
Sit up, Agent Doggett.
I had to make sure.

170
00:16:11,784 --> 00:16:15,515
- Make sure of what?
- Make sure that you're still you.

171
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:21,424
Yeah, I'm still me. So why don't
you put that weapon down?

172
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,260
You see this? Huh, do you see it?

173
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:27,731
""Man shot at the White House.''

174
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,430
They killed him for what he knew.

175
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:36,498
- Then they'll kill me, too.
- Not if you put the weapon down.

176
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:39,703
No. They'll kill me anyway.

177
00:16:41,347 --> 00:16:43,975
I got one chance here. With you.

178
00:16:45,084 --> 00:16:46,449
Sit down.

179
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,714
Didn't I tell you to sit down?

180
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:57,018
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're going with me.

181
00:16:57,096 --> 00:16:59,621
And I'm going to show you

182
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:05,399
and you are going to spread the word.

183
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:08,099
Doubting Thomas
is going to spread the word.

184
00:17:08,341 --> 00:17:11,310
What word?

185
00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:14,869
The invasion has begun.

186
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:17,711
What invasion?

187
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,913
- They're already here.
- Who's already here?

188
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:23,386
Certain men have gone out among you

189
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:25,982
and have withdrawn
the inhabitants of their city

190
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:28,925
saying, ""Let us go, and serve other gods

191
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:31,361
that ye have not known.''

192
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,092
I don't know what that means.

193
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:38,934
I open my mouth... in parables.

194
00:17:39,004 --> 00:17:41,768
I utter things that...

195
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:45,402
have been kept secret from the world.

196
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:47,105
( telephone ringing )

197
00:17:50,516 --> 00:17:55,852
On your knees,John Doggett.

198
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:58,947
SKINNER: 
He goes by the name Absalom.
Aself-styled prophet

199
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:00,982
Agent Scully and I
apprehended in Montana

200
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,585
where he commanded members
of a small UFO cult.

201
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:05,129
( line ringing )

202
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:08,925
These words were found
on the wall of his cell

203
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:13,836
after he escaped from a work detail
40 miles from the state prison.

204
00:18:13,873 --> 00:18:15,670
Now, we don't know they mean

205
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:19,838
butAbsalom claimed to have
knowledge of an alien invasion.

206
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:26,478
There were also claims of
healings of numerous abductees

207
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:29,385
that had been subjected
to alien torture.

208
00:18:29,455 --> 00:18:31,582
( snickering )

209
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:35,559
Claims that have never
been substantiated... or refuted.

210
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:41,695
But evidence of torture was real.

211
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:49,073
Now, the only way we're going to
get answers is to bring this guy in.

212
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:52,100
Just know the man that you're
looking for is dangerous.

213
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:55,443
He's a felon, and he is
capable of physical violence.

214
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:58,074
All right, that's it.

215
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:03,053
- Where the hell is Agent Doggett?
- I can't reach him.

216
00:19:03,122 --> 00:19:05,613
I can't run this thing, Agent Scully.

217
00:19:05,658 --> 00:19:07,148
This is obviously an X-Files case.

218
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:09,956
I know. And I'm all over it.
I will fiind him.

219
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:11,997
( telephone ringing )

220
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,526
I don't know if this is going
to make you feel any better.

221
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:24,967
Hey.

222
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:32,176
- Mulder...
- Who says you can't go home again?

223
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:35,084
- What are you doing here?
- What's it look like?

224
00:19:35,154 --> 00:19:38,021
It looks like you want to give
them real ammunition to use on you

225
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:42,551
- that's what it looks like.
- Hey, I am just down here
visiting my buds.

226
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:45,723
Where is this Agent Doggett anyway?
What kind of hours does he keep?

227
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:49,564
- Please, you do not want
to stir that up right now.
- Why?

228
00:19:49,635 --> 00:19:52,195
Because we have a manhunt in progress
and I wantAgent Doggett running it.

229
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:55,138
Anything to do with this?

230
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:57,767
This Absalom abductee class picture?

231
00:19:57,843 --> 00:20:00,812
Yes... it does.

232
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,542
- Why?
- Because I noticed that
the man who was shot

233
00:20:03,616 --> 00:20:06,847
on The White House lawn is one of
the men in that photograph.

234
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:09,547
Top right hand corner. In profiile.

235
00:20:09,622 --> 00:20:11,647
Howard Salt, if I'm not mistaken.

236
00:20:11,724 --> 00:20:14,557
He's right. You're right.

237
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:17,960
Consider that a freebie.
The next one's going to cost you.

238
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:20,522
- Why? What else do you know?
- Oh, I don't know anything.

239
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:23,090
But you know me, I got a real big hunch.

240
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:25,695
This Howard Salt was
a multiple alien abductee

241
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,796
worked for the U.S. Census Bureau.

242
00:20:27,873 --> 00:20:30,000
Wanted to get word to the President
unspecifiied grievances.

243
00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:32,009
What do you want to bet
those grievances were?

244
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:36,003
- You think he knew something?
- I think they killed him for it.

245
00:20:36,081 --> 00:20:39,016
The man jumped the White House fence.
He had a gun.

246
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:42,019
Once again, I'm a betting man.
I'm betting he had more than that.

247
00:20:42,054 --> 00:20:44,579
Mulder, you make it sound like
this was a conspiracy.

248
00:20:44,657 --> 00:20:47,023
Ooh. There's that word again.

249
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:50,027
You're being paranoid, Mulder.
Even for you.

250
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:52,029
Do you want to hear something
really paranoid?

251
00:20:52,064 --> 00:20:54,157
The F.B.I. gets its way,
there's going to be nobody down here

252
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:56,030
to ask the paranoid questions.

253
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:58,661
Nobody to fiind those faces
in those photographs.

254
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:04,198
Surely not this Agent Doggett.

255
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,548
Just what do you have in mind

256
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:11,913
if you don't mind my asking?

257
00:21:11,984 --> 00:21:16,011
It's my head that's going to
get blown off if there's a screw up.

258
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:19,683
We're going to get what that man
at the White House died for.

259
00:21:19,758 --> 00:21:21,885
- ( cocks )
- To get it?

260
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:26,193
- To get it where?
- You just concentrate on not
screwing up, Agent Doggett.

261
00:21:26,265 --> 00:21:27,732
( gun chamber clicks )

262
00:21:29,234 --> 00:21:34,907
Either way, you and I are going
to become overnight sensations.

263
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:36,898
Either way, you and I are going
to become overnight sensations.

264
00:21:41,947 --> 00:21:44,279
Mulder, I know you know this
but if anything leaves this room

265
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,581
-you could be in violation of the law.
- Really?

266
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,784
When I was dead I was hoping
maybe they changed the rules.

267
00:21:51,857 --> 00:21:55,588
Mulder, just being here could be used
by Kersh as cause for dismissal.

268
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:58,357
Then why don't you shut the door
so he doesn't fiind out.

269
00:22:09,074 --> 00:22:12,009
I just don't know what you're hoping
to fiind in Salt's personal effects.

270
00:22:12,044 --> 00:22:14,103
Neither do I, really.

271
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:16,306
But maybe it's like
Howard Salt's picture

272
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:19,146
I'll know it when I see it.

273
00:22:19,218 --> 00:22:20,685
So you'll risk the consequences

274
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:22,152
even though there may be nothing here?

275
00:22:22,221 --> 00:22:23,620
You don't get it, do you, Scully?

276
00:22:23,689 --> 00:22:25,714
The man shot at the White
House, the prison escapee

277
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,691
there's something bubbling
to the surface here.

278
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:29,216
I want to know what it is.

279
00:22:29,294 --> 00:22:31,319
Mulder, you've been through an ordeal

280
00:22:31,397 --> 00:22:33,194
that defiies all logical explanation.

281
00:22:33,265 --> 00:22:37,929
How can you think that
these two men have the answers

282
00:22:38,003 --> 00:22:40,665
when they defy all
standard of credibility?

283
00:22:40,739 --> 00:22:44,732
Since when has an X-File not defiied
a certain standard of credibility?

284
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,641
At least that's the way it used to work.

285
00:22:46,712 --> 00:22:50,045
Look, Scully, I need to make sense
of what happened to me.

286
00:22:50,082 --> 00:22:51,947
So that I can stop it.

287
00:22:52,017 --> 00:22:54,212
Because if I can't stop it,
it could happen to anyone.

288
00:22:54,253 --> 00:22:57,654
It could happen to you. And who's to say
it's going to stop there?

289
00:22:57,723 --> 00:23:01,819
Mulder, if you go down the X-Files
will go down, too.

290
00:23:01,894 --> 00:23:05,762
Theoretically, they could put
you in prison for what you're doing here.

291
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:07,890
Yeah, well, compared to where I just was

292
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:09,399
prison would be a Princess Cruise.

293
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:20,968
Ho. Hey. What the hell is this?

294
00:23:21,046 --> 00:23:25,039
The entire hard drive is taken up
with this. Ten gigabytes of memory.

295
00:23:35,928 --> 00:23:38,419
- It's been encrypted.
- Mm.

296
00:23:38,497 --> 00:23:40,965
What are you doing?

297
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:43,695
I'm going to book myself
on that Princess Cruise.

298
00:23:47,806 --> 00:23:48,966
I'll book it for you.

299
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:20,937
State your name and your business.

300
00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:24,932
Special Agent John Doggett, F.B.I.

301
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,119
( buzzer )

302
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:04,174
( beeping )

303
00:25:10,122 --> 00:25:15,116
I hope you know I got no idea
where I'm going down here.

304
00:25:15,194 --> 00:25:18,960
I just need access to wherever
they compile all the available data

305
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:21,226
- from the current U.S. Census.
- And then what?

306
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,134
Then you pick up the phone you tell
the F.B.I. why you aren't coming to work

307
00:25:25,204 --> 00:25:27,798
until somebody pays us
some serious attention.

308
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:30,808
Just so you're not surprised
we might not make it that far.

309
00:25:30,876 --> 00:25:34,175
We passed through an X-ray scanner
on the way in here back at the gate.

310
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:36,237
Well, you better hope we make it.

311
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:38,340
I'd hate to see you die in vain.

312
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:41,079
That's sort of in your hands, huh?
So just in case

313
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,215
how about you tell me what's in this
facility that's worth me dying for.

314
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,451
- It's all in the Census data. Proof.
- What?

315
00:25:47,526 --> 00:25:52,156
That they're already here.
That they're already among us.

316
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:54,165
It's all in there.

317
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:58,966
I got a loaded gun pointed at
this man's head! He's an F.B.I. agent!

318
00:25:59,037 --> 00:26:01,164
- Listen to him!Just back off!.
- I'll pull the trigger!

319
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,299
- Listen to the man! Back off!.
- I'll pull it.

320
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,400
Lower your weapons! Listen to him!

321
00:26:22,327 --> 00:26:24,295
SKINNER: 
It may not be the best way

322
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:26,058
but it's certainly one way
to catch an escaped convict.

323
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:27,621
I'll give you that, Agent Doggett.

324
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:30,494
I'd just as soon stick
to the old-fashioned way, sir.

325
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:32,298
Shot was a little too close for comfort.

326
00:26:32,371 --> 00:26:34,931
You say this man claimed
the U.S. Census Bureau had data

327
00:26:35,007 --> 00:26:37,134
information that
he was after that connects

328
00:26:37,209 --> 00:26:39,143
to this man who was shot
on the White House lawn?

329
00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:42,305
Proof, he said,
that they were here among us

330
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:43,473
whoever they are.

331
00:26:43,548 --> 00:26:46,142
- ( door opens )
- Sir.

332
00:26:46,218 --> 00:26:48,516
- Agent Mulder.
- Is this John Doggett?

333
00:26:48,553 --> 00:26:51,181
You Agent Doggett?

334
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:54,419
I hope you're not commending him
as a hero for what he did,
because he is not.

335
00:26:54,493 --> 00:26:57,155
I'm not about to referee a boxing match.

336
00:26:57,229 --> 00:27:00,460
-Just what's the problem here?
- The problem? You occupy
an offiice that used to be...

337
00:27:00,532 --> 00:27:04,468
devoted to fiinding the truth
and now you're busy burying
it, that's the problem.

338
00:27:04,536 --> 00:27:08,063
Whoa, you must've got your wires
crossed somewhere, Agent Mulder.

339
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,200
- You got that man killed.
- I got him killed?

340
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:13,608
Because of what he knew.
What he was going to expose.

341
00:27:13,645 --> 00:27:17,206
- You see this, Agent Mulder?
- I see you sitting there,
Agent Doggett.

342
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:21,713
That's good enough for me.

343
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:36,998
You've got to understand
what he's been through.

344
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:39,128
I mean, now he's back and you're...

345
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:48,643
You know, it's really not fair.
You've been dead for six months

346
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,513
and you still look better than me.

347
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:55,611
- But not by much.
- ( chuckling )

348
00:27:55,687 --> 00:27:59,748
Melvin. I'd be a whole lot
happier to see you

349
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:02,722
if you'd just take
your hands off my ass.

350
00:28:02,961 --> 00:28:04,519
Sorry.

351
00:28:04,596 --> 00:28:06,996
I think it goes without saying

352
00:28:07,065 --> 00:28:10,228
that we're all, uh,
tremendously relieved.

353
00:28:10,302 --> 00:28:13,237
And not just because we got
big questions about your involvement

354
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:14,567
in a certain blessed event.

355
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:19,673
So much for playing a hunch, Mulder.

356
00:28:19,745 --> 00:28:23,772
The, uh, Gunmen were able
to decrypt the data that you found

357
00:28:24,016 --> 00:28:25,574
on Howard Salt's hard drive.

358
00:28:25,617 --> 00:28:27,380
It was a series of fiile directories

359
00:28:27,452 --> 00:28:29,477
that were downloaded
the day that he died.

360
00:28:29,554 --> 00:28:33,490
- Downloaded from where?
- The F.S.C., the Federal
Statistics Center.

361
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:37,619
A government information bank
used by the U.S. Census Bureau
where your Mr. H. Salt worked.

362
00:28:37,696 --> 00:28:40,062
All right, what are you waiting for,
boys? Get cracking.

363
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:41,793
Unless you think we're all idiots

364
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:43,763
it's only Langly who's the idiot.

365
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:45,599
LANGL Y: 
Don't make like it's my hacking skills.

366
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,763
I've never seen such
a radical counterdefensive.

367
00:28:48,006 --> 00:28:50,440
Fifteen minutes after
Howard Salt was shot

368
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:52,636
at the White House, fiirewalls went up

369
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:55,271
on every data bank
at that very facility.

370
00:28:55,347 --> 00:28:57,338
Well, why do that?

371
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:04,054
Because I'm right. Because they would
kill to protect what's in those fiiles.

372
00:29:04,122 --> 00:29:07,558
Unless you got a password
we don't see any way short of that

373
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:09,389
of getting ahold of this data.

374
00:29:09,461 --> 00:29:12,362
And the thing is
even if you have a pass code

375
00:29:12,397 --> 00:29:15,423
you still have to break
into the F.S.C.just to use it.

376
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:19,669
We all agree, you're going
to have to let this one go.

377
00:29:19,738 --> 00:29:23,265
Oh. I see.

378
00:29:26,411 --> 00:29:30,677
Somebody's been doing a little
campaigning for her cause.

379
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:33,343
Well, just remember, boys,
this is America.

380
00:29:33,418 --> 00:29:36,546
Just because you get more votes
doesn't mean you win.

381
00:29:57,476 --> 00:29:59,637
( sniffles, sighs )

382
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:03,408
Your name came up today,John.
Folks are all worked up.

383
00:30:03,482 --> 00:30:05,211
They say you dodged a bullet.

384
00:30:05,283 --> 00:30:08,150
You can't dodge what you don't
see coming, Knowle, that's for sure.

385
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,745
That should tell you something about
who you're dealing with.

386
00:30:10,822 --> 00:30:15,555
Who am I dealing with?
NSA? Secret Service? Military? Who?

387
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:17,151
You know better than that,John.

388
00:30:17,195 --> 00:30:20,323
They shot the man in cold blood.

389
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:23,128
Didn't even stop to ask him his name.

390
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:25,226
The way I hear it he made it too easy.

391
00:30:25,303 --> 00:30:27,533
Taking a federal agent hostage
in a government facility.

392
00:30:27,606 --> 00:30:29,631
They'd have shot him anyway.

393
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:32,677
- Without a doubt.
- Why?

394
00:30:32,744 --> 00:30:36,271
You and I have been friends
a long time,John.

395
00:30:36,348 --> 00:30:40,216
I tell you things.
But this is a whole other level.

396
00:30:40,285 --> 00:30:43,345
Don't give me that doublespeak crap,
Knowle. I'm being accused.

397
00:30:43,421 --> 00:30:47,357
- Accused? Of what?
- Of being used to get that man killed.

398
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:50,724
- Well, that's insane.
- Oh, is it?

399
00:30:52,631 --> 00:30:56,431
Maybe I am being used,
and I just don't know it.

400
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:58,366
That's what I want to know from you.

401
00:30:58,436 --> 00:31:00,301
Can't tell you that,John.

402
00:31:00,372 --> 00:31:03,205
But I can tell you something.

403
00:31:10,415 --> 00:31:12,610
One thing you already know.

404
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:14,777
These men are very good shots.

405
00:31:14,853 --> 00:31:16,821
What don't I know?

406
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:19,847
Three words.

407
00:31:25,497 --> 00:31:26,589
( horn honks )

408
00:31:30,569 --> 00:31:31,763
Hold up!

409
00:31:31,836 --> 00:31:33,565
Agent Doggett?

410
00:31:33,638 --> 00:31:36,630
- Yeah.
- Could you wait a minute?

411
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:39,836
Agent Scully, I'm sorry
to surprise you. I don't mean to.

412
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:42,402
What are you doing here at this hour?
You're freezing cold.

413
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,244
I got something for Agent Mulder
only I can't go up there.

414
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:47,182
I don't know him, and I
know he doesn't trust me

415
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:48,686
so I'm going to ask
you to get it to him.

416
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:50,983
What do you have to give him?

417
00:31:51,223 --> 00:31:55,216
Information about this
escaped convict who took me hostage.

418
00:31:55,293 --> 00:31:57,989
One of his disciples was the man
shot on the White House lawn.

419
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:01,199
Oh, yeah, Agent Mulder
knows that already.

420
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:03,224
What he doesn't know is that man
had a computer diskette

421
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:05,667
that he was trying to get
to the President.

422
00:32:05,737 --> 00:32:08,001
- Who gave you this information?
- I can't tell you that

423
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,404
but what I can tell you is is this
diskette was labeled with a pass code.

424
00:32:12,477 --> 00:32:15,446
You have this, this password?

425
00:32:15,513 --> 00:32:16,844
It's three words:

426
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,680
""Fight the future.''

427
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,793
Scully, what are you doing back?

428
00:32:40,372 --> 00:32:41,498
Did something just happen?

429
00:32:41,573 --> 00:32:43,632
I'm, um...

430
00:32:45,343 --> 00:32:50,713
I'm not exactly sure
I should tell you, Mulder.

431
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:55,810
Scully, if you know something
that can get us moving forward
again, you need to tell me.

432
00:33:05,497 --> 00:33:07,260
( pounding on door )

433
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:16,631
- Yeah, who is it?
-It's Skinner. Open up, Agent Doggett.

434
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:19,074
- What are you doing here?
- I got a call from Agent Scully.

435
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:23,008
- She's at her apartment,
completely beside herself.
- Over what?

436
00:33:23,081 --> 00:33:25,049
Mulder somehow got hold of
a computer password

437
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:28,416
- to a database fiilled with secrets.
- What kind of secrets?

438
00:33:28,486 --> 00:33:31,717
Names of people the federal government
is tracking using the U.S. Census.

439
00:33:31,756 --> 00:33:33,621
Names of people who have
a certain genetic profiile.

440
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:37,890
The same information he believes the
shooter at the White House knew about.

441
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:41,831
- Also the guy that took you hostage.
- You said Scully was upset.

442
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,063
That Mulder was going to act
on this information in some way that...

443
00:33:45,103 --> 00:33:47,503
What?

444
00:33:47,572 --> 00:33:51,804
- You know about this?
- I gave Scully the password.

445
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:55,607
- Where did you get it?
- I can't tell you that.

446
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,444
You know, I'm starting
to wonder about you, too,John.

447
00:33:58,516 --> 00:34:01,485
Just whose side you are working on here.

448
00:34:01,553 --> 00:34:05,353
I'm starting to wonder
about that myself.

449
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:13,695
You said Scully's at her apartment.
What's the number there?

450
00:34:13,765 --> 00:34:17,132
That's why I'm here. I can't
get ahold of them-- either one of them--

451
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:19,769
and I have no idea where they went.

452
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,700
- Where are you going?
- I can't tell you that, either.

453
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:26,711
If I open up my mouth,
I put you at risk.

454
00:34:28,012 --> 00:34:31,038
You're going to have
to trust me on this.

455
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:46,430
( sighs ) Oh, man.

456
00:34:46,498 --> 00:34:47,795
( knocking )

457
00:34:50,802 --> 00:34:53,737
- What are you doing here?
- Where's Agent Mulder?

458
00:34:53,772 --> 00:34:55,637
He wouldn't listen to me.

459
00:34:55,707 --> 00:34:57,572
Get out of here. Get going.

460
00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:00,976
- I can't do that to him.
- Then do it for yourself.

461
00:35:01,045 --> 00:35:04,412
Look, I think I may have set you up.

462
00:35:04,482 --> 00:35:06,006
- What?
- You just get out of here now

463
00:35:06,084 --> 00:35:07,915
- and I'll explain it to you later.
- No.

464
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:11,149
You explain it to me now.
Set us up how, and with whom?

465
00:35:11,389 --> 00:35:15,553
The same men that shoot fiirst
and ask questions later.

466
00:35:16,694 --> 00:35:18,628
Agent Doggett!

467
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:23,800
Frohike?

468
00:35:23,835 --> 00:35:27,134
Langly? Byers? Let's go.
I'm dying out here.

469
00:35:27,172 --> 00:35:31,506
Well, let us just fiinish
our cappuccino and biscotti,
and we'll see what we can do.

470
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:33,601
BYERS:
You can start walking now, Mulder.

471
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:36,613
- Is the system bypassed?
- You'll know if it's not.

472
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:37,705
Great.

473
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:11,077
FROHIKE: Smile, buddy boy.
The eye in the sky is watching.

474
00:36:11,115 --> 00:36:14,676
We're gonna be watching Mulder
get busted if I don't fiind
the override circuit.

475
00:36:14,752 --> 00:36:18,688
BYERS: Everything's under control,
Mulder.Just hold tight.

476
00:36:20,492 --> 00:36:22,153
LANGLY: Okay, got it!

477
00:36:22,227 --> 00:36:24,661
( beeps )

478
00:36:24,729 --> 00:36:26,219
And voila!

479
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:55,725
Come on, guys. I'm on autopilot here.

480
00:36:55,793 --> 00:36:58,853
BYERS: Go left, Mulder.
There should be a pair of glass doors

481
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,727
about a hundred yards up.

482
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:04,199
According to our information,
those doors will lead you
straight into the data bank.

483
00:37:14,979 --> 00:37:16,913
Hey, who's working on the locks, fellas?

484
00:37:16,948 --> 00:37:19,940
Stand by. There you go.

485
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:29,885
LANGL Y:  There ought to be two work
stations in the middle of the room.

486
00:37:29,961 --> 00:37:33,294
Either one will give you
access to the data.

487
00:37:45,777 --> 00:37:47,938
Let's do some E-mailing.

488
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:55,682
Agent Mulder, get out of there!

489
00:37:59,157 --> 00:38:00,852
( pounding )

490
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:03,792
- Agent Mulder!
- ( knocking )

491
00:38:03,828 --> 00:38:05,853
Mulder? What the hell's that?

492
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,057
Your life's in danger
if you don't get out now.

493
00:38:08,132 --> 00:38:10,066
Just a fly buzzing around the window.

494
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:16,305
( groaning )

495
00:38:18,676 --> 00:38:21,668
Agent Mulder, get out.
You're coming with me.

496
00:38:21,713 --> 00:38:23,704
I'm here to save you,
whatever you may think.

497
00:38:23,781 --> 00:38:26,909
I think you're trying to keep
this information from ever
seeing the light of day,

498
00:38:26,985 --> 00:38:29,977
just like you did once before,
Agent Doggett, that's what I think.

499
00:38:30,054 --> 00:38:32,682
Agent Mulder, I don't even know
what that information is.

500
00:38:32,757 --> 00:38:35,021
You're about to, along
with a lot of other people.

501
00:38:35,093 --> 00:38:37,220
There going to learn that
they've been targeted because
of their genetic profiiles

502
00:38:37,261 --> 00:38:41,254
for abduction and replacement
by alien facsimiles.

503
00:38:41,332 --> 00:38:45,735
What do you say we start off with
The Washington Post, huh?

504
00:38:45,803 --> 00:38:49,170
You can believe whatever you
want, but that information
is never going to make it out.

505
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,868
What are you going to do, shoot me?

506
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:08,985
( phone ringing )

507
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,288
ALL: Hello.

508
00:39:10,328 --> 00:39:13,320
- Something's wrong.
- What are you talking about?

509
00:39:13,364 --> 00:39:16,629
I think we've been set up.
You have to get Mulder out of there.

510
00:39:16,701 --> 00:39:19,169
Right now that's basically impossible.

511
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:22,964
Uh-oh. Mulder?

512
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:25,339
- You'd better start typing fast.
- Why?

513
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,934
The cavalry just arrived.

514
00:39:28,446 --> 00:39:30,846
You son of a bitch. You set me up.

515
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:32,007
No.

516
00:39:34,886 --> 00:39:38,378
- Get him out of there, Gunmen.
- LANGLY: We're working on it.

517
00:39:38,456 --> 00:39:42,119
- Come on, Agent Mulder.
- Hey, get off of me.

518
00:39:43,895 --> 00:39:47,126
If I set you up, I wouldn't be here
trying to convince you to go.

519
00:39:47,198 --> 00:39:50,656
They're coming to kill you.
They're going to kill me, too.
That's the set up.

520
00:39:50,735 --> 00:39:53,295
LANGL Y: Mulder, I think
you better listen to the man.

521
00:39:53,371 --> 00:39:56,704
They got the data trapped
and I can't get it uploaded
let alone start transmission.

522
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:03,943
- What is happening, Byers?
- I'm trying to fiigure that out.

523
00:40:04,015 --> 00:40:07,075
- Mulder, are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

524
00:40:07,118 --> 00:40:10,246
It's look like there's really, uh,
no good way out of there.

525
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:12,289
Uh...

526
00:40:12,323 --> 00:40:14,814
Except...

527
00:40:14,892 --> 00:40:16,018
Except what?

528
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:24,393
It's a long shot, but, uh, worth a try
especially given the alternative.

529
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,831
Here's what you do.

530
00:41:19,757 --> 00:41:21,884
You've got two minutes, Knowle.

531
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:23,950
Two minutes to give me one good reason

532
00:41:24,028 --> 00:41:25,928
why I shouldn't put your name in lights.

533
00:41:25,997 --> 00:41:30,798
Why I shouldn't expose you
for the lying bastard you are.

534
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:33,234
Hey,John, nice knowing you.

535
00:41:34,872 --> 00:41:36,840
You see that man across the park?

536
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,335
You walk, that man puts your
name on all the wrong desks.

537
00:41:41,412 --> 00:41:43,437
I get it,John.

538
00:41:43,514 --> 00:41:48,008
You asked me for information,
I tell you what I can.

539
00:41:48,085 --> 00:41:50,451
What you do with it is out of my hands.

540
00:41:50,521 --> 00:41:53,388
You knew what I would do with it.
That's why you gave it to me.

541
00:41:53,457 --> 00:41:55,891
You expose me and then what?

542
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,020
Where are you going to get your answers?

543
00:41:59,096 --> 00:42:02,429
'Cause you're standing
on the tip of the iceberg, my friend.

544
00:42:02,466 --> 00:42:06,197
- You're full of crap.
- Am I?

545
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,797
What is it you think those men
were trying to protect? Census data?

546
00:42:09,874 --> 00:42:11,603
You need me worse than you know.

547
00:42:11,843 --> 00:42:15,574
I don't need someone using me
to get another man killed.

548
00:42:15,813 --> 00:42:17,440
You think this is about Mulder?

549
00:42:17,515 --> 00:42:19,278
It's about the truth,John.

550
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,818
What truth?

551
00:42:21,886 --> 00:42:23,911
You got it all right in front of you.

552
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:26,320
It's all in the X-Files.

553
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:31,191
I'm just one man trying to point you
in the right direction.

554
00:43:46,604 --> 00:43:48,606
[ Child ]
I made this.

555
00:43:48,606 --> 00:43:50,631
[ Child ]
l made this.
