1
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,268
Anson? Anson?
Where are you, Anson?

2
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,971
Anson. Come back, Anson.

3
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,810
Anson. Calling Anson.

4
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:17,816
Where are you, Anson?

5
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:22,047
Anson.!

6
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,352
Anson. Calling Anson.

7
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,358
Where are you, Anson?

8
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:30,558
Anson.!

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,564
Where are you, Anson?

10
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,973
Anson, get out here!

11
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:56,778
I've warned you
about your attitude.

12
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,790
You clean out 407?

13
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:01,520
No, of course you haven't
cleaned out 407.

14
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:04,085
You've only had
all damn morning.

15
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,361
You think you're ever going to own any
of those boats the way you're going?

16
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,994
You think you're ever
going to amount to anything?

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,301
You can't even finish
a simple job.

18
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,001
A monkey could
do this job, all right, Jay?

19
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,136
Well, you can't.
So what's that say about you?

20
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,113
- Shut up.
- Excuse me?

21
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,810
I didn't catch that.

22
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:29,651
You clean out 407, you move out that
deadbeat's stuff, and you do it now.

23
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:32,816
And when I come back in an hour,
it better be done.

24
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,769
Anson!

25
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,779
Anson?

26
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:10,745
- Son of a...

27
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,496
Anson.

28
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,999
Anson!

29
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,802
Oh, that's it, Anson.

30
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,032
You hear me, Ans...

31
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:20,085
Can I get you some coffee?

32
00:04:20,158 --> 00:04:23,025
Water? Anything?

33
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:27,156
Good morning.

34
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:30,496
- Good morning.

35
00:04:32,436 --> 00:04:36,236
Special Agent Dana Scully,
this is, uh, Jay Gilmore.

36
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:40,736
How...
Nice to meet you.

37
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:44,008
Nice to meet...
Likewise.

38
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:49,985
Mr. Gilmore came all the way to see us
from Missouri, the "Show Me" State.

39
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:55,219
They told me you were the people to
best understand my sit... my sit...

40
00:04:55,293 --> 00:05:01,163
It's okay. Uh, this is
Mr. Gilmore's situation.

41
00:05:01,232 --> 00:05:03,826
This condition came on
very suddenly about a month ago.

42
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:06,927
Anson Stokes,
he did this to me.

43
00:05:07,004 --> 00:05:10,701
I don't know how.
I just... I know it was him.

44
00:05:10,775 --> 00:05:13,608
Anson Stokes
is a former employee...

45
00:05:13,678 --> 00:05:16,977
at the self-storage yard
that Mr. Gilmore owns.

46
00:05:17,048 --> 00:05:19,243
Apparently there was some
bad blood between you two.

47
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:22,013
He told me to shut up!
Huh?

48
00:05:22,086 --> 00:05:27,956
Yeah. And then Mr. Gilmore
was, uh, stricken...

49
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:29,754
- Stricken... stricken.
- Uh-huh.

50
00:05:29,827 --> 00:05:32,022
And Anson Stokes
was nowhere to be found.

51
00:05:32,096 --> 00:05:36,533
He resurfaced several days
later, and the police wanted
to question him, but he refused.

52
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:40,264
Do you know what he said?
He said they had nothing on him.

53
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:44,035
Well, and to be fair, sir,
they didn't. They don't.

54
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:47,339
They had to make me
a whole new mouth.

55
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:50,869
Do you think Blue Cross
is going to pay for this? Uh-uh.

56
00:05:50,948 --> 00:05:53,143
I demand justice!

57
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:55,151
Ow.

58
00:06:04,795 --> 00:06:06,786
- Mulder, all I'm saying is that...
- I know.

59
00:06:06,864 --> 00:06:10,391
This may not be a crime, and this guy
Stokes may not know anything about it.

60
00:06:10,468 --> 00:06:14,063
Look, there is a condition
called microstomia... small mouth...

61
00:06:14,138 --> 00:06:17,505
which is brought on
by the disease scleroderma.

62
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:19,509
It's the overproduction
of collagen.

63
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:23,104
It can actually reduce a person's mouth
to a tiny little opening.

64
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,114
But that takes months
to develop, right?

65
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:28,948
It doesn't just happen in the blink of
an eye. Gilmore's surgeons are stumped.

66
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,284
They're writing it up in
the New England Journal of Medicine.

67
00:06:31,355 --> 00:06:34,791
There's always nasal aplasia,
the complete absence of the nose.

68
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:37,259
That's a nose, Scully.
We're talking mouth here.

69
00:06:37,328 --> 00:06:40,491
But what we're talking is medical,
physiological, not criminal.

70
00:06:40,564 --> 00:06:42,964
- Not as far as I can see.
- Maybe, but I still want to know...

71
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:47,835
- Why Anson Stokes doesn't want
to talk to the police.
- Mulder.

72
00:06:56,847 --> 00:07:01,147
That's a little... out of place,
wouldn't you say?

73
00:07:01,218 --> 00:07:03,209
A little bit.

74
00:07:04,555 --> 00:07:06,716
Ah, damn it.

75
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:10,454
- Leslie!
- What? What is it?

76
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:15,056
I.R.S. agents. Gotta be.
Get rid of them, all right?

77
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:33,815
Hi. We're looking
for a Mr. Anson Stokes.

78
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:35,715
He's not here.

79
00:07:35,786 --> 00:07:37,811
Would you happen to know
when he's coming back?

80
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:44,089
Well, we are Agents Mulder
and Scully from the F.B.I.

81
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:46,925
The boat's... The boat's not ours.

82
00:07:46,997 --> 00:07:50,763
We're holding it for someone, and,
you know, th-they pay the taxes on it.

83
00:07:50,835 --> 00:07:53,395
Okay.

84
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:55,939
Anson's not here.

85
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:58,668
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's your name?

86
00:07:58,743 --> 00:08:01,940
- Leslie Stokes.
- Oh, you're Anson's brother?

87
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:12,450
Hi there.

88
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:17,058
We're not here to
talk about the boat, Leslie.

89
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:21,462
We want to talk to your brother
about his former employer, Mr. Gilmore.

90
00:08:21,532 --> 00:08:25,696
And the, uh, unfortunate condition
that he's found himself in.

91
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,637
- Would you happen
to know anything about that?
- The mouth thing?

92
00:08:28,706 --> 00:08:31,573
Well, yeah, you know,
that's just, uh...

93
00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:33,906
That's, like, chemicals.

94
00:08:33,978 --> 00:08:36,276
"Chemicals"?

95
00:08:36,347 --> 00:08:39,111
Well, yeah, you know, like people
store weird chemicals, like...

96
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:41,208
Like my brother, one time
he smelled this weird smell.

97
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:43,253
You know, it was just a guy
with a meth lab,

98
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,254
you know, like in one
of the storage units.

99
00:08:45,322 --> 00:08:47,722
That's probably something
you guys should look into.

100
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:50,090
I'm gonna get going.
So I'm gonna go. Okay.

101
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:53,820
Okay.

102
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:56,560
Now I see what's
going on here.

103
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:08,175
According to Gilmore, he was standing
right where I am when it happened.

104
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:13,208
Well, I don't smell
any weird chemical smells.

105
00:09:13,284 --> 00:09:15,684
You still have
both your lips.

106
00:09:15,753 --> 00:09:17,914
Apparently everything
is left as it was.

107
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:27,990
Hey. 1978.

108
00:09:28,065 --> 00:09:31,865
It's been a long time since any of
this stuff has seen the light of day.

109
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:34,370
That's too bad, Mulder.
Underneath all this dust,

110
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:36,770
this furniture
is really wonderful.

111
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:39,469
Oh, well, you want to hit
some yard sales while we're out here?

112
00:09:39,543 --> 00:09:44,776
Mulder, this furniture is expensive.
Very expensive.

113
00:09:44,849 --> 00:09:47,875
- What's your point?
- My point is that...

114
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:51,186
there's a lot of money sitting around
here, and maybe something's missing.

115
00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:54,311
- Like what?
- I don't know. Jewelry.

116
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:57,290
Anson Stokes opened up the storage unit,
and then he just disappeared.

117
00:09:57,358 --> 00:10:01,192
- Winds up with the Titanic
in his driveway.
- Mm-hmm.

118
00:10:01,262 --> 00:10:03,958
There's your crime...
theft.

119
00:10:04,032 --> 00:10:06,398
Still doesn't explain
what happened to Gilmore.

120
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:10,367
Hey, Scully,
check this out.

121
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:17,074
- Ouch.
- This woman look familiar to you?

122
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:21,707
- That's the woman from the trailer.
- It's the young woman from the trailer.

123
00:10:21,783 --> 00:10:24,775
How many centuries now
has disco been dead?

124
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:33,659
Two down. Two down,
I got nothing to show for it.

125
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:35,662
You got the boat.

126
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,824
And what the hell
good is that? Huh?

127
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,664
That thing is like a big...
You know, a big...

128
00:10:41,736 --> 00:10:46,173
- White elephant?
- What? I'm sorry. What does that mean?

129
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:50,905
It's a big expensive item
that serves no purpose and is
more trouble than it's worth.

130
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,614
So what the hell
did you give it to me for?

131
00:10:54,682 --> 00:10:58,778
- Because you asked for it.
- All right. I can appreciate that.

132
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:02,755
But don't you think maybe you could've
found some fricking water to put it in?

133
00:11:02,824 --> 00:11:06,783
- You didn't specify water.
- I gotta specify that you
put a boat in the water?

134
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:11,889
That is a given.!
Fricking white elephant.

135
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:14,662
I can't even pay
the taxes on it.

136
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:18,331
Why don't you just use your last wish
to get rid of it?

137
00:11:18,406 --> 00:11:20,636
You want me to put you
in a home or something maybe?

138
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:24,576
Because I just told you, Leslie,
that I wasted two wishes, okay?

139
00:11:24,646 --> 00:11:29,106
Are you listening? I am not gonna
waste the third, all right? Come on.

140
00:11:30,618 --> 00:11:35,078
Come on! I gotta concentrate here.
Let me figure this out.

141
00:11:35,156 --> 00:11:38,614
Third wish, third wish. Final wish.
I'm just spitballing here.

142
00:11:38,693 --> 00:11:40,957
If I happen to say "I wish"
by accident, that does not count.

143
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:43,964
Not until I am
absolutely ready, okay?

144
00:11:44,032 --> 00:11:46,626
You could always give that guy
his mouth back.

145
00:11:46,701 --> 00:11:49,295
All I said is that I wish
Jay would shut the hell up.

146
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:54,398
If you feel bad about what you did
to him, fix it on your own dime, okay?

147
00:11:54,475 --> 00:11:56,943
- It doesn't work like that.
- Whatever.

148
00:11:57,011 --> 00:12:01,812
- Leslie, would you help me out here?
- Um, money.

149
00:12:01,883 --> 00:12:03,748
- Yeah. Okay, that's not bad.
- Wish for money.

150
00:12:03,818 --> 00:12:06,685
But don't you think we should
think of something that would...

151
00:12:06,754 --> 00:12:09,279
generate money instead of
the actual money itself?

152
00:12:09,357 --> 00:12:11,689
Brains? Talent?
Hard work?

153
00:12:13,294 --> 00:12:16,991
Uhhh, a money machine.

154
00:12:17,065 --> 00:12:19,363
Okay, that's not...
But something better. Something better.

155
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:21,425
Okay. But I just...

156
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:26,337
- An infinite number of wishes.
- Okay!

157
00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:29,808
Just three, boys.
Settle down.

158
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:32,539
Damn it, this is hard!

159
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:35,013
You know,
I have a thought.

160
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,950
- Granted it's pretty obvious.
- What, what, what, what, what?

161
00:12:41,422 --> 00:12:43,356
- What?
- What?

162
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,166
- Seriously, what?
- Oh, forget it!

163
00:12:56,337 --> 00:12:58,897
- I got it. I got it.
- Yeah?

164
00:12:58,973 --> 00:13:02,568
I got it, I got it, I got it. Okay,
are you ready? Because I am ready.

165
00:13:02,643 --> 00:13:04,702
I am absolutely ready.
Okay, here it goes.

166
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:09,842
I wish that I could
turn invisible... at will.

167
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:13,683
- You're kidding.
- No, no, this is perfect.

168
00:13:13,755 --> 00:13:16,485
Yeah, I can have an advantage
that nobody else on Earth can have.

169
00:13:16,557 --> 00:13:22,359
I can, um, you know, spy and learn
secret information. Pick up stock tips.!

170
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,898
- Sneak into a women's locker room?
- Not just that, okay?

171
00:13:24,966 --> 00:13:28,697
I'm talking about
James Bond-type stuff, you know?

172
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,933
Your wish is breathtaking
in its unoriginality.

173
00:13:32,006 --> 00:13:36,067
You don't have to like it, all right?
You just have to do it, right?

174
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,214
Done.

175
00:13:44,252 --> 00:13:49,019
- My... clothes are gonna
turn invisible too, right?
- You didn't specify clothes.

176
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,024
Son of a...

177
00:13:52,493 --> 00:13:55,189
Screw it!

178
00:14:03,037 --> 00:14:06,564
Oh, God.
Turn invisible, please.

179
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,813
Yes.!

180
00:14:13,881 --> 00:14:16,941
Oh, man, this is awesome.!
Hey, hey, hey, brother.

181
00:14:17,018 --> 00:14:19,486
Hey, Leslie, I'm over here.
I'm over here.

182
00:14:19,554 --> 00:14:21,488
Can you see me?

183
00:14:26,494 --> 00:14:30,225
Whoa.! Aah.!
Damn it.!

184
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:33,631
- Anson, are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

185
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:35,726
I can't see my damn feet.

186
00:14:35,803 --> 00:14:39,136
Look out, world,
here I come.!

187
00:14:41,642 --> 00:14:45,476
I'm invisible.!
Invisible, baby.! Whoo.!

188
00:14:45,546 --> 00:14:48,174
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yes.!

189
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:50,547
You can't see me,
can you?

190
00:14:50,618 --> 00:14:53,587
- I... Whoo!

191
00:14:57,191 --> 00:14:59,125
Hey, uh...

192
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:10,329
Get out of my way, birds.

193
00:15:12,206 --> 00:15:15,175
Oh. Well, hello, ladies.

194
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:21,907
Here comes Anson.
That's right.

195
00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:24,178
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on, come on. Change, change.

196
00:15:24,252 --> 00:15:26,948
All right. Here we go.

197
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:31,390
Need a little roadside assistance,
do you?

198
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:34,155
Not to worry.
Here comes Anson.

199
00:15:46,538 --> 00:15:48,631
Whoa!

200
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:13,529
Can we go now?

201
00:18:08,746 --> 00:18:10,771
I think you missed
a spot here.

202
00:18:12,283 --> 00:18:14,877
I can see straight through
to his ass.

203
00:18:17,955 --> 00:18:20,116
This is Anson Stokes, huh?

204
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:22,216
It is.

205
00:18:22,293 --> 00:18:24,227
His dental records
are a match.

206
00:18:24,295 --> 00:18:26,229
He was found about
a half mile from his house.

207
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:31,064
He was probably hit by a car
or a truck or something.

208
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:33,399
And he's invisible.

209
00:18:33,471 --> 00:18:35,405
Yes, he is.

210
00:18:37,175 --> 00:18:39,200
Wow.

211
00:18:39,277 --> 00:18:43,373
You know, in the seven years
we've been working together,
I have seen some amazing things,

212
00:18:43,448 --> 00:18:47,578
but this...
this takes the cake.

213
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:51,520
It's... It's gonna change
the boundaries of science.

214
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:55,491
It is amazing, but I don't think
it has anything to do with science.

215
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,529
Remember Mr. Saturday
Night Fever?

216
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,164
- Yeah.
- I did a little background checking.

217
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:04,531
His real name
is Henry Flanken.

218
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,230
He redefined the term
"overnight success."

219
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:10,672
In 1977, his net worth
was 36,000 dollars.

220
00:19:10,742 --> 00:19:13,836
And in 1978,
it was 30 million dollars.

221
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:19,713
Then there is the interesting way
in which Mr. Flanken died.

222
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,547
How's that?

223
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,087
Chronic morbid tumescence.

224
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,751
- You don't mean what I think you mean?
- Schwing!

225
00:19:27,825 --> 00:19:31,226
On April 4, 1978, he was admitted
to Gateway Memorial Hospital...

226
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,456
with an extreme
priapic condition.

227
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:36,295
Apparently he was
quite the specimen.

228
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:40,303
They had to raise the door frame
in order to wheel him
into his hospital room.

229
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,203
Well, what does any of that
have to do with this?

230
00:19:46,277 --> 00:19:48,745
Well, I think our
mystery woman is the link,

231
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:52,579
about whom I can find
no information whatsoever.

232
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,882
- I think she's responsible
for all of this.
- But how?

233
00:19:56,954 --> 00:19:58,979
I-I don't know,

234
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:02,219
but we need to talk to her.

235
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:06,957
Uh, I think I should stay here
with the body. I mean, I... You know...

236
00:20:07,031 --> 00:20:10,091
I don't think it's a good idea
to leave him unguarded.

237
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,864
This is truly amazing.

238
00:20:12,937 --> 00:20:14,871
Okay.

239
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:29,443
I'm very sorry for your loss.

240
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:35,082
- Anson didn't suffer, did he?
- No, I don't think he suffered.

241
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:40,686
But the part about him being invisible,
that doesn't, uh,

242
00:20:40,764 --> 00:20:43,232
catch you off guard
just a little bit?

243
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,768
Uh...

244
00:20:47,337 --> 00:20:49,703
Leslie, there was a woman here earlier.
Where is she now?

245
00:20:49,773 --> 00:20:53,436
She's, uh... She's gone.

246
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,638
Let me tell you where I'm going with
this. I think that woman is a Jinniyah.

247
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,876
- Are you familiar with that term?
- No.

248
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,316
It's the feminine
for "genie," as in...

249
00:21:02,385 --> 00:21:04,979
a demon or spirit from
Middle Eastern folklore?

250
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:20,065
Yeah, except Barbara Eden
never killed anybody.

251
00:21:20,136 --> 00:21:25,005
Now, in Arabic mythology,
they speak of these beings that
are composed of flame or air...

252
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,202
but take human form.

253
00:21:27,277 --> 00:21:30,144
They can perform certain tasks
or grant certain wishes.

254
00:21:30,213 --> 00:21:34,980
They live in inanimate objects
like a lamp or a ring. Is this
beginning to sound familiar?

255
00:21:36,486 --> 00:21:38,954
Leslie, I believe your brother
found just such an object...

256
00:21:39,022 --> 00:21:41,252
in the storage facility,
didn't he?

257
00:21:41,324 --> 00:21:43,724
He took possession
of theJinniyah,

258
00:21:43,793 --> 00:21:45,852
and he made some
pretty outrageous requests,

259
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,124
likeJay Gilmore's mouth
and that yacht out in the driveway.

260
00:21:48,198 --> 00:21:51,099
Wait, wait.
You believe all that?

261
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:53,397
I do.

262
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,404
And Leslie,
for your own safety,

263
00:21:55,472 --> 00:21:59,431
so that what happened to your brother
doesn't happen to you,

264
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:01,875
I think you should hand over
that object to me right now.

265
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,739
You're doing
the right thing.

266
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,984
Scully, come check this out.

267
00:22:52,062 --> 00:22:54,428
Come on.
He's not going anywhere. Come on.

268
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,602
Bye.

269
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:04,401
I have a group of researchers
flying in from Harvard Medical.

270
00:23:04,474 --> 00:23:06,772
I can't wait
to see their faces.

271
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,813
- What's this?
- It's not what I hoped it would be,

272
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,871
judging from the odor
coming from inside.

273
00:23:12,949 --> 00:23:15,884
I think it's where the Stokes brothers
keep their weed.

274
00:23:15,952 --> 00:23:18,921
But that's not what
I wanted to show you.

275
00:23:21,091 --> 00:23:24,822
- Recognize him? How about her?
- Benito Mussolini.

276
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:33,862
Your mystery woman
or someone who looks a lot like her.

277
00:23:33,937 --> 00:23:36,497
The computer says
it is her.

278
00:23:36,573 --> 00:23:39,633
I ran her through Quantico's
facial recognition software...

279
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,768
and couldn't come up with a match
in the known-felon database.

280
00:23:41,845 --> 00:23:46,214
Then I took a flyer and checked with
the image bank at the National Archives.

281
00:23:46,282 --> 00:23:49,718
- Voila.
- Well, even if it is her,

282
00:23:49,786 --> 00:23:51,777
Mulder, what would she
be doing with Mussolini?

283
00:23:51,855 --> 00:23:54,722
Or Richard Nixon,
for that matter.

284
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,163
I don't know, except
that they're both men...

285
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:05,327
who got all the power they ever
wished for and then lost it.

286
00:24:10,373 --> 00:24:12,841
See? I told you
it'd look good in here.

287
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,810
Nice rug. How do you breathe
in that thing?

288
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:18,040
Can we just get
this over with, please?

289
00:24:18,114 --> 00:24:20,844
- Three wishes. Go.
- Don't rush me, all right?
I want to do this right.

290
00:24:22,318 --> 00:24:26,880
I've gotta be smarter than Anson was.
Damn it, Anson.

291
00:24:26,956 --> 00:24:30,551
Then can I once again
offer you a suggestion?

292
00:24:30,627 --> 00:24:32,254
Hmm.

293
00:24:34,297 --> 00:24:37,232
- What?
- This!

294
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,268
Your disability?

295
00:24:39,335 --> 00:24:42,532
There was some tragedy
involved here I assume.

296
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:45,130
Well, yeah, it was
pretty tragic, I guess.

297
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:47,733
Me and Anson were playing
mailbox baseball.

298
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:50,609
God, I miss that.
And Anson's driving.

299
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,046
I was leaning pretty far out
the window there.

300
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,050
Oh...

301
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,913
You mean this!

302
00:24:58,988 --> 00:25:00,922
Yeah, you're right.

303
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,958
I could wish for
a solid gold wheelchair.

304
00:25:03,026 --> 00:25:06,757
Man, that'd be sweet. I see what
you're saying. But you know what?

305
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,764
There's something I want
more than that.

306
00:25:19,574 --> 00:25:22,065
You're not gonna believe
your eyes.

307
00:25:22,143 --> 00:25:25,306
I certainly didn't.
You ready?

308
00:25:32,754 --> 00:25:35,222
Oh, he's, uh...

309
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:39,590
He is invisible,
after all. Um...

310
00:25:48,403 --> 00:25:50,337
He's in there.

311
00:26:05,453 --> 00:26:08,889
Okay. You know what?
He's creeping me out.

312
00:26:08,957 --> 00:26:11,357
This isn't what I asked for.
He's all weird and messed up.

313
00:26:11,426 --> 00:26:14,088
- He's been hit by a truck.
What did you expect?
- Yeah.

314
00:26:14,162 --> 00:26:16,187
I asked you to bring him
back to normal.

315
00:26:16,264 --> 00:26:19,199
- You asked me to bring him back.
- Okay, you know, this...

316
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,871
Now he's starting to smell bad!
This isn't what I wanted!

317
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:30,843
He's gotta at least be able to talk.
You know what? That's my next wish.

318
00:26:30,912 --> 00:26:33,437
- Wish number two: :
I wish Anson could talk.
- No, you don't.

319
00:26:33,515 --> 00:26:37,781
Yes, I do, and that's final!
I wish Anson could talk!

320
00:26:42,724 --> 00:26:44,658
Done.

321
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,671
I should just shoot myself.

322
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,140
Oh!

323
00:27:01,209 --> 00:27:04,303
I was so happy.
I was so excited.

324
00:27:04,379 --> 00:27:08,042
What was I thinking?
An invisible man?

325
00:27:08,116 --> 00:27:10,584
You saw it.
It was real.

326
00:27:10,652 --> 00:27:14,213
I don't know what I saw, Mulder.
I'm...

327
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:16,985
I do know that having that
kind of proof in my hands,

328
00:27:17,058 --> 00:27:19,618
it was just too good
to be true.

329
00:27:19,694 --> 00:27:21,855
I don't think that's why
the body disappeared.

330
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,091
Why did the body disappear?

331
00:27:24,165 --> 00:27:26,895
I think it was a result
of a wish being granted.

332
00:27:26,968 --> 00:27:30,529
A wish? Whose wish?

333
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:34,063
Who would want Anson Stokes back?
I mean, really, really back?

334
00:27:34,142 --> 00:27:36,770
His brother, Leslie?

335
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:51,892
Well, this is no good!

336
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,293
What did you do to me?

337
00:27:55,363 --> 00:27:59,459
You're back from the dead, man!
What kind of gratitude is that?

338
00:27:59,534 --> 00:28:02,230
What did you do to me?

339
00:28:02,303 --> 00:28:05,363
I wasted two wishes on you,
that's what I did!

340
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,704
I can't feel my heart.

341
00:28:09,844 --> 00:28:12,472
I... I can't feel my blood.

342
00:28:15,884 --> 00:28:18,717
I am yellow!

343
00:28:18,786 --> 00:28:21,152
I'm cold. I'm cold.

344
00:28:21,222 --> 00:28:24,055
- You know what? Screw this.
- I'm cold.

345
00:28:25,326 --> 00:28:28,887
- I'm cold.
- I wasted two wishes on you...

346
00:28:30,465 --> 00:28:32,695
and a perfectly good bowl
of cornflakes.

347
00:28:41,376 --> 00:28:45,836
There, I turned the heat up!
Are you happy now, huh? Are you happy?

348
00:28:47,181 --> 00:28:49,809
Is there anything else
I can do for you there, buddy?

349
00:28:49,884 --> 00:28:53,615
What do you say?
Maybe wipe your little yellow butt?

350
00:28:53,688 --> 00:28:55,588
Thanks for nothing.

351
00:28:55,657 --> 00:28:57,921
You wanna make
your third wish, champ?

352
00:28:57,992 --> 00:29:00,324
I'd like to get out of here
before the blowflies hatch.

353
00:29:00,395 --> 00:29:04,525
Yeah, I tell you what.
My last wish is gonna be for me, okay?

354
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:06,533
It's gonna be for me.
You hear that, Anson?

355
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:10,162
I wasted two wishes on you, and you
don't even give a damn about that.!

356
00:29:10,238 --> 00:29:13,036
Okay. All right.
Third wish.

357
00:29:13,107 --> 00:29:15,803
Let's see.
I could wish for, uh...

358
00:29:15,877 --> 00:29:17,811
I could wish for money.

359
00:29:17,879 --> 00:29:20,939
Everybody wishes for money.

360
00:29:21,015 --> 00:29:23,848
Um... There's
the invisibility thing.

361
00:29:23,918 --> 00:29:28,651
I guess that turned out pretty stupid,
though, huh, Anson? To be invisible!

362
00:29:28,723 --> 00:29:31,157
That was real smart, huh?

363
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:45,730
Uh, X-ray eyes, maybe.
No, that isn't it.

364
00:29:46,808 --> 00:29:48,776
Like you said,
solid gold wheelchair.

365
00:29:48,843 --> 00:29:52,904
- Uh...

366
00:29:52,981 --> 00:29:55,149
Wait, I got it. Legs!

367
00:30:43,263 --> 00:30:45,527
Would you mind removing
your eyewear, ma'am?

368
00:30:57,144 --> 00:30:59,078
Do you have a name?

369
00:30:59,146 --> 00:31:01,114
Not for a long time, now.

370
00:31:01,181 --> 00:31:04,878
How about if I call you Jenn?
That's short forJinniyah.

371
00:31:10,924 --> 00:31:14,382
The, uh, fire department
just recovered two bodies.

372
00:31:14,461 --> 00:31:18,090
- Leslie Stokes and his brother Anson?
- Looks like it.

373
00:31:18,165 --> 00:31:22,727
And, uh, Anson Stokes
is visible now, of course.

374
00:31:23,937 --> 00:31:26,405
But what I'd really love
an explanation for...

375
00:31:26,473 --> 00:31:29,067
is how his corpse got
from my locked morgue...

376
00:31:29,142 --> 00:31:32,578
all the way across town
to the Mark Twain Trailer Park.

377
00:31:32,646 --> 00:31:35,911
Ask him.
He's got it all figured out.

378
00:31:35,983 --> 00:31:38,474
I know what he'd say. He'd say
that you're some kind of a genie...

379
00:31:38,552 --> 00:31:41,453
from a Thousand and One Nights
or something like that...

380
00:31:41,521 --> 00:31:43,955
- And that you grant people wishes.
- There you have it.

381
00:31:44,024 --> 00:31:48,961
One thing I haven't been able
to figure out is whether you're
a good genie or an evil one.

382
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:51,964
Everybody you come in contact with
seems to meet a bad end.

383
00:31:52,032 --> 00:31:55,627
That's the conclusion you've drawn?
That I'm evil?

384
00:31:55,702 --> 00:32:00,537
Well, possibly evil.
Possibly cursed. A curse to others.

385
00:32:00,607 --> 00:32:03,201
The only thing you people
are cursed with is stupidity.

386
00:32:03,277 --> 00:32:05,370
All of you. Everybody.

387
00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:09,506
Mankind. Everyone I have ever come
into contact with without fail.

388
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:11,517
Always asking
for the wrong thing.

389
00:32:11,585 --> 00:32:14,110
- You mean making the wrong wishes?
- Yeah.

390
00:32:14,187 --> 00:32:16,451
It's always,
"Give me money.

391
00:32:16,523 --> 00:32:19,048
Give me big boobs.
Give me a big hoo-hoo.

392
00:32:19,126 --> 00:32:22,323
Make me cool like the Fonz. "

393
00:32:22,396 --> 00:32:25,695
- Or whoever's the big name now.
- You've been out
of circulation a long time.

394
00:32:25,766 --> 00:32:29,463
So what? In 500 years,
people have not changed a bit.

395
00:32:29,536 --> 00:32:32,471
Five hundred years?

396
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:35,940
Granted they smell better now,
generally speaking.

397
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:38,534
But human greed still reigns...

398
00:32:38,612 --> 00:32:42,048
shallowness, a propensity
for self-destruction.

399
00:32:42,115 --> 00:32:45,050
You're saying that you have been
a firsthand witness...

400
00:32:45,118 --> 00:32:48,713
to 500 years
of human history?

401
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:51,417
I used to be human.

402
00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:54,153
I was born
in 15th century France.

403
00:32:54,227 --> 00:32:57,424
And then one day an old Moor came
to my village peddling rugs.

404
00:32:57,497 --> 00:33:01,729
- And I unrolled one that an
ifrit had taken residence in.
- An "ifrit"?

405
00:33:01,802 --> 00:33:05,033
A very powerful class
of genie.

406
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:10,270
He offered me three wishes. For the
first, I asked for a stouthearted mule.

407
00:33:10,344 --> 00:33:15,372
For the second, uh, a magic sack
that was always full of turnips.

408
00:33:15,449 --> 00:33:18,350
Did I mention this was
15th century France?

409
00:33:18,418 --> 00:33:20,386
What was your third wish?

410
00:33:20,454 --> 00:33:23,480
My third...
I pondered for a great while.

411
00:33:23,557 --> 00:33:26,117
I didn't want to waste it.

412
00:33:26,193 --> 00:33:29,560
So finally, feeling very intelligent,
I spoke up, and I said...

413
00:33:34,768 --> 00:33:37,134
"I wish for great power
and long life."

414
00:33:37,204 --> 00:33:39,570
And thus became
a genie yourself.

415
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:43,575
Gave me the mark of theJinn...
right there.

416
00:33:43,643 --> 00:33:47,773
It's forever.
Sort of like a prison tattoo.

417
00:33:47,848 --> 00:33:50,408
I should've been
more specific.

418
00:33:53,053 --> 00:33:55,214
So am I under arrest?

419
00:33:55,288 --> 00:33:59,554
I can't think of anything
we have to hold you on.

420
00:33:59,626 --> 00:34:01,787
Not surprisingly, we don't have
any evidence of any of this,

421
00:34:01,862 --> 00:34:04,888
so, uh, I think
she's free to go.

422
00:34:04,965 --> 00:34:08,492
No, I'm not.
He unrolled me.

423
00:34:11,872 --> 00:34:14,602
I get three wishes.

424
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:27,846
So, your partner left
the airport rather quickly.

425
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,787
I don't think
she likes me very much.

426
00:34:30,856 --> 00:34:33,950
Oh, well, I don't think she
knows what to make of you.

427
00:34:34,026 --> 00:34:37,359
- I don't... think I do either, really.

428
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:40,523
Well, you could always
give up your three wishes.

429
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:43,534
I'll disappear.
No hard feelings.

430
00:34:43,602 --> 00:34:47,470
- I didn't think so.
So what's your first wish?

431
00:34:48,574 --> 00:34:51,202
Well... W-W...

432
00:34:51,276 --> 00:34:53,836
What would your wish be
if-if you were in my place?

433
00:34:53,912 --> 00:34:56,278
I'm not you.
It doesn't matter.

434
00:34:56,348 --> 00:34:58,942
No, but, you know, I just...
I'd like to know.

435
00:35:02,621 --> 00:35:05,488
I'd...

436
00:35:05,557 --> 00:35:07,991
wish that I never heard
the word "wish" before.

437
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:12,520
I'd wish that I could live
my life moment by moment,

438
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:19,301
enjoying it for what it is
instead of...

439
00:35:19,371 --> 00:35:21,305
instead of worrying
about what it isn't.

440
00:35:22,908 --> 00:35:26,503
I'd sit down somewhere
with a great cup of coffee,

441
00:35:28,247 --> 00:35:30,579
and I'd watch the world go by.

442
00:35:34,386 --> 00:35:36,377
But then again,
I'm not you.

443
00:35:36,455 --> 00:35:38,480
So I doubt that's your wish.

444
00:35:38,557 --> 00:35:41,287
You know, I think I'm beginning
to see the problem here.

445
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,920
You say that most people
make the wrong wishes, right?

446
00:35:43,996 --> 00:35:47,056
Without fail. It's like giving
a chimpanzee a revolver.

447
00:35:47,132 --> 00:35:50,260
This is because they make their wishes
solely for personal gain.

448
00:35:50,335 --> 00:35:52,997
- Could be.
- So the trick would be...

449
00:35:53,072 --> 00:35:55,836
to make a wish that's totally
altruistic, that's for everyone.

450
00:36:00,479 --> 00:36:02,344
So, um,

451
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:08,412
I wish for peace on Earth.

452
00:36:10,289 --> 00:36:12,723
Peace on Earth.
That's it?

453
00:36:15,127 --> 00:36:17,391
What the hell's wrong with that?
You can't do it?

454
00:36:17,463 --> 00:36:20,364
No. I can.

455
00:36:20,432 --> 00:36:22,866
- It's done.

456
00:36:31,009 --> 00:36:32,943
Oh, crap.

457
00:36:59,138 --> 00:37:02,232
I guess I should have
seen this coming!

458
00:37:07,346 --> 00:37:09,280
Scully.

459
00:37:17,289 --> 00:37:19,223
Scully?

460
00:37:26,231 --> 00:37:28,165
Hello?

461
00:37:30,369 --> 00:37:32,303
Hello!

462
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:40,470
Very good. Genie!

463
00:37:40,546 --> 00:37:44,448
- Genie! Whatever the hell
your name is!
- Yes?

464
00:37:46,985 --> 00:37:50,819
- What the hell is this?
- It's what you asked for...
peace on Earth.

465
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:53,119
Listen.

466
00:37:53,192 --> 00:37:55,387
You know damn well
that's not what I meant.

467
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,123
- You didn't specify.
- This has nothing to do
with specificity!

468
00:37:59,198 --> 00:38:03,066
You don't have to wipe out the entire
population of the whole planet...

469
00:38:03,135 --> 00:38:05,695
just to affect a little peace on Earth
and goodwill towards men.

470
00:38:05,771 --> 00:38:07,898
Mmm, you didn't say,
"Goodwill towards men."

471
00:38:09,575 --> 00:38:13,841
So you expect me to change the hearts
of six billion people?

472
00:38:13,912 --> 00:38:16,540
No religion in history's
been able to pull that off.

473
00:38:16,615 --> 00:38:19,209
Not Allah or Buddha
or Christ.

474
00:38:19,284 --> 00:38:21,275
But you'd like me to do that
in your name?

475
00:38:21,353 --> 00:38:25,653
So... what, you can feel
real good about yourself?

476
00:38:25,724 --> 00:38:29,091
D-Did I say that?
I... I didn't say that.

477
00:38:29,161 --> 00:38:32,597
Mmm, how grotesquely
egotistical of you.

478
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,194
I bet you wish you
hadn't made your first wish.

479
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:41,672
Yes, I do, since you butchered
the intent of that wish so completely.

480
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:45,335
And another thing. I think you've got
a really horrible attitude.

481
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:48,470
I guess that comes from being rolled up
in a rug for the last 500 years.

482
00:38:48,547 --> 00:38:52,608
But we're not all that stupid. We're
not all chimpanzees with revolvers.

483
00:38:52,684 --> 00:38:55,915
I think there's another
possibility here, and that's
just that you're a bitch!

484
00:38:57,923 --> 00:39:00,756
Agent Mulder?

485
00:39:03,996 --> 00:39:05,930
Sir.

486
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,525
How did you get in here?

487
00:39:10,602 --> 00:39:12,471
Uh...

488
00:39:12,604 --> 00:39:14,401
"Whereas,
I have one wish left...

489
00:39:14,473 --> 00:39:16,737
and desire to use it most effectively
for the good of all mankind..."

490
00:39:16,808 --> 00:39:21,211
yadda, yadda, yadda...
"here on this plane of existence. "

491
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:24,180
Hmm.

492
00:39:24,249 --> 00:39:26,217
What, are you a lawyer?

493
00:39:26,284 --> 00:39:28,309
Well, I have to be with you.

494
00:39:28,386 --> 00:39:31,412
I'm gonna get this last wish perfect.
I'm not gonna leave you any loopholes.

495
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:34,459
I'm not gonna let you
interpret this as an edict
to bring back the Third Reich...

496
00:39:34,526 --> 00:39:37,620
or to make everyone's eyes
grow on stalks.

497
00:39:37,696 --> 00:39:40,722
Oh, geez. And I was so
looking forward to that.

498
00:39:54,179 --> 00:39:58,639
Skinner called me, Mulder.
Is everything all right?

499
00:39:59,885 --> 00:40:01,819
You don't remember
disappearing...

500
00:40:01,887 --> 00:40:04,515
off the face of the earth
for about an hour this morning?

501
00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:06,921
No.

502
00:40:06,992 --> 00:40:09,483
Then I guess everything's okay.

503
00:40:11,663 --> 00:40:13,597
Mul...

504
00:40:15,567 --> 00:40:17,501
Could you give us
a minute, please?

505
00:40:17,569 --> 00:40:19,503
Sure.

506
00:40:26,278 --> 00:40:28,212
Like today?

507
00:40:30,282 --> 00:40:32,216
Wh...

508
00:40:36,755 --> 00:40:39,349
- Where the hell'd she go?
- Boink!

509
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,756
No. It's gotta...

510
00:40:41,826 --> 00:40:45,353
It's gotta be hypnotism
or mesmerism or something.

511
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,957
Scully, it is what it is. You examined
an invisible body, remember?

512
00:40:49,034 --> 00:40:51,298
- I thought I did.
- Oh!

513
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:53,303
Mulder, all right. Say...

514
00:40:53,371 --> 00:40:56,568
Say that you're right.
Say this is what it is.

515
00:40:56,641 --> 00:41:01,340
Then what you're doing
is extraordinarily dangerous.
You even said that yourself.

516
00:41:01,413 --> 00:41:05,372
No, no, the trick is to be specific,
to make the wish perfect.

517
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,680
That way everyone
is gonna benefit.

518
00:41:07,752 --> 00:41:09,686
It's gonna be a safer world,
a happier world.

519
00:41:09,754 --> 00:41:11,949
There's gonna be food for everyone,
freedom for everyone,

520
00:41:12,023 --> 00:41:15,982
the end of tyranny
of the powerful over the weak.

521
00:41:16,061 --> 00:41:19,155
- Am I leaving anything out?
- It sounds wonderful.

522
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:23,030
- Then what's the problem?
- Maybe it's the whole point...

523
00:41:23,101 --> 00:41:26,036
of our lives here, Mulder,
to achieve that.

524
00:41:26,104 --> 00:41:28,572
I mean,
maybe it's a process...

525
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,838
that one man shouldn't try
and circumvent with a single wish.

526
00:41:54,366 --> 00:41:56,300
You ready?

527
00:41:58,269 --> 00:42:00,635
Yeah, I'm ready.

528
00:42:11,516 --> 00:42:14,610
I can't believe you
don't want butter on your popcorn.

529
00:42:14,686 --> 00:42:17,348
Ew. It's un-American.

530
00:42:17,422 --> 00:42:19,856
- Caddyshack, Mulder?

531
00:42:19,924 --> 00:42:22,518
- It's a classic American movie.

532
00:42:22,594 --> 00:42:25,859
That's what every guy says.
It's a guy movie.

533
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:29,593
Okay, when you invite me over to your
place, we can watch Steel Magnolias.

534
00:42:37,475 --> 00:42:42,310
- So, um, what's the occasion?

535
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,372
I don't know. It just...
felt like the thing to do.

536
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:48,385
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

537
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,324
I don't know if you noticed,
but, um,

538
00:42:54,392 --> 00:42:56,485
I never made the world
a happier place.

539
00:42:59,731 --> 00:43:01,961
Well, I'm fairly happy.

540
00:43:02,033 --> 00:43:04,593
That's something.

541
00:43:04,669 --> 00:43:07,331
And now our feature presentation.

542
00:43:10,508 --> 00:43:13,238
So what was
your final wish anyway?

543
00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:20,874
I'm all right

544
00:43:39,738 --> 00:43:41,672
Here you go.
