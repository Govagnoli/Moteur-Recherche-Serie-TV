[Scully]
Yeah.

32
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:33,582
Mr. Pintero said that would only
happen if considerable weight
was placed on it from above.

33

- This is where you saw the body ?
- Yes, ma'am.

00:04:36,356 --> 00:04:40,122

Her neck was cut.

And the blood from the victim
was pooling where ?

were gone when you returned ?

You're saying that what this man saw
was the victim's ghost ?

a disembodied soul.

Any idea about
the psychology at work ?

called ego dystonia, a form of
obsessive compulsive disorder,

and inescapable impulses...

to change things,
to organize, to reorganize.

143
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:05,466
But it's not ordinarily something
that escalates to a murderous impulse.

a more complex psychology at work...

Harold Spuller suffers from
pervasive developmental disorder...

167

where they're sometimes
called atypical autism.

168
00:13:42,468 --> 00:13:47,064
He has spent his entire life
in and out of facilities
just like this one.

169

He has been medicated,
he has received shock therapy,

170
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,273
and aside from
his other disabilities,

171
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:56,304
he has been diagnosed
with severe ego dystonic
obsessive compulsive disorder,

172
00:13:56,382 --> 00:13:59,146
which would explain
the switching of the victims' rings.

- So why all of a sudden ?
- You mean what made him snap ?

174
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:06,252
I think his outburst clearly showed
a frustrated impulse towards violence...

when he was put
in a challenging situation.

176
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:12,162
That out burst didn't come
until after I'd asked him
if he'd ever seen a ghost.

building in him from the
moment the interview began.

Yeah.

that Harold Spuller is the man
we came looking for ?

00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:25,873
I'm sure Harold Spuller's
the man that made that phone call.

182
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:29,403
But what led us to him,
it still remains unexplained.

183
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:32,042
- "She is me" ?
- Mm-hmm.
And the other apparitions.

at the bowling alley.

I think I have an idea about that,
if not an explanation.

Harold Spuller is at
this facility voluntarily,

187
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:42,251

and go as he pleases.

Apparently she was on her way home

after school.

She had a ring on her left hand.
It was switched to her right hand.

Hey, Scully. Is it too late ?

No. What are you doing,

- I need your help on something.
I needed your medical expertise.
- On what ?

Harold Spuller. Oh !

He's dead.

365

- How ?
- Natural causes. Heart failure.
Just keeled over.

366

- That's what you need
my medical opinion on ?
- No.

367
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:02,641
Harold Spuller had a premonitory
vision of his boss's death.

368
00:30:02,714 --> 00:30:05,308
- I don't understand.
- Harold saw an apparition.

369
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:07,817
What may have been
Angie Pintero's disembodied soul...

370
00:30:07,886 --> 00:30:10,116
at the moment of
or just prior to his death.

371
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:12,850
- How do you know ?
- Because I was standing
right there when he saw it.

372
00:30:12,924 --> 00:30:15,620
- But you didn't see it yourself?
- No.

00:30:15,694 --> 00:30:17,628
Why ?

374

I don't have that facility.

375
00:30:19,698 --> 00:30:22,758
That kind of connection
to the victims that would have
made such a vision possible.

376
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:25,200
What's Harold Spuller's
connection ?

377
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,000
I don't know its exact nature,
but I think it has something
to do with his autism.

378
00:30:28,073 --> 00:30:31,372
That Harold experienced
a profound attachment
to these victims,

379
00:30:31,443 --> 00:30:33,411
but because of his disability,
was unable to express...

380
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:35,810
the depth and power
of those relationships.

381
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:40,875
So somehow a psychic
or preconscious bond was formed
that went beyond the temporal.

382
00:30:40,986 --> 00:30:43,352
Whoa, wait a minute.
So Harold knew the people
that were killed ?

383
00:30:43,421 --> 00:30:45,787
Yeah, from the bowling alley.
Going back seven years.

384
00:30:45,857 --> 00:30:47,882
Even if what you're saying
is true,

385
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:50,359
Harold wasn't the only one
who claims to have seen
these apparitions.

386
00:30:50,428 --> 00:30:54,091
No. But he does have something
in common with those
who've had the visions...

387
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:56,100
that is quite powerful
in its own right.

388

- They were all dying.

- Well, what if he isn't ?
- I would be very surprised.

393
00:31:14,953 --> 00:31:18,013
What is a death omen if not
a vision of our own mortality ?

394
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:21,456
And who among us would most
likely be able to see the dead ?

Stay where you are !

495

Drop it !

[ Groaning ]

499
00:40:10,188 --> 00:40:12,679
She’s alive.
Let's get a paramedic inhere.

500
00:40:12,757 --> 00:40:14,281
Yeah.

501
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:17,452
- You're cut.
- Yeah, she attacked me.

502
00:40:24,135 --> 00:40:26,865
You might wanna bag that.
I'm pretty sure it's the murder weapon.

503
00:40:31,442 --> 00:40:35,742
She had been taking Harold's meds--
clonazepam and clozapine--

504
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:39,681
the unregulated effects of which are
violence and unpredictable behavior.

505
00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:41,776
Yeah, but why did you
even suspect her ?

506
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:43,844
I went in to talk
to Harold's roommate,

507
00:40:43,921 --> 00:40:46,048
and he said that Harold thought
she had been poisoning him.

508
00:40:46,157 --> 00:40:49,786
So I went in to confront her
and she just went off.

509
00:40:49,894 --> 00:40:52,419
- Why do you think
she killed those women ?
- I don't know.

510
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:56,091
I mean, maybe in some
drug-addled way, she was
trying to kill happiness.

511
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:59,261
Harold's happiness.
His love for those women.

512
00:40:59,337 --> 00:41:03,535
Maybe trying to destroy
something she thought
she'd never have again.

513
00:41:03,608 --> 00:41:06,509
- "She is me."
- I don't know.

514
00:41:06,577 --> 00:41:08,602
- Have they found Harold ?
- Yeah.

515
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:11,876
They found him in an alley
a few blocks from here,
face down on the pavement.

516
00:41:11,949 --> 00:41:14,509
They worked on him for 20 minutes,
but he couldn't be revived.

517
00:41:14,585 --> 00:41:19,284
- What happened ?
- Well, preliminary diagnosis
is apnea: respiratory failure.

518
00:41:19,357 --> 00:41:22,190
- As a result of what ?
- The paramedics are at a loss
to explain that.

519
00:41:22,293 --> 00:41:25,194
But if what you’re saying is true,
that Harold stopped taking
his medication,

520
00:41:25,263 --> 00:41:27,356
then that could have been
a factor in his death.

521
00:41:27,465 --> 00:41:31,094
- At least in the visions
that he was seeing.
- Harold Spuller wasn't dying.

522
00:41:31,169 --> 00:41:34,502
He was killed as a result of what
that woman took away from him.

523
00:41:34,572 --> 00:41:36,274
Is that your medical opinion ?

524
00:41:36,274 --> 00:41:38,003
Is that your medical opinion ?

525
00:41:38,075 --> 00:41:41,533
- I saw something, Mulder.
- What ?

526
00:41:43,214 --> 00:41:45,341
The fourth victim.

527
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:48,442
I saw her in the bathroom
before you came to tell me.

528
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:50,612
Why didn’t you tell me ?

529
00:41:50,688 --> 00:41:52,986
Because I didn't want
to believe it.

530
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,285
Because I don't
want to believe it.

531
00:41:55,393 --> 00:41:59,352
Is that why you came down here ?
To prove that it wasn't true ?

532
00:41:59,463 --> 00:42:01,988
No. I came down here
because you asked me to.

533
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:04,533
Why can’t you be honest
with me ?

534
00:42:04,602 --> 00:42:07,127
What do you want me to say ?
That you’re right ?

535
00:42:07,205 --> 00:42:10,106
That I believe it, even if I don't ?
Is that what you want ?

536
00:42:10,174 --> 00:42:15,510
- Is that what you think
I want to hear ?
- No.

537
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:19,983
You can believe what you want to believe,
but you can't hide the truth from me.

538
00:42:20,051 --> 00:42:22,417
Because if you do,
then you're working against me.

539
00:42:22,486 --> 00:42:24,420
And yourself.

540
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:30,350
I know what you're afraid of.

541
00:42:30,461 --> 00:42:32,429
I'm afraid of the same thing.

542
00:42:34,866 --> 00:42:37,460
The doctor said I was fine.

543
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:41,397
I hope that's the truth.

544
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:45,809
I'm going home.
