00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,877
<i>(radio)... rocked New Mexico.</i>
<i>Centred under the desert...</i>

3
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,953
<i>... the 5.6 tremor was felt as far away</i>
<i>south as Corona and Roswell.</i>

4
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,350
- Where are you going?
- Riding. I'll be back in a few hours.

5
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,431
Eric.

6
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,352
Leave the snakes alone today.

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,796
They'll be angry and afraid.

8
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,198
I found something. You better come see.

9
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,589
<i>(woman)</i> Robert, come home right now!

10
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,476
What do you think it is?

11
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,915
I don't know.

12
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,991
<i>(speaks Navajo)</i>

13
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,311
What did he say?

14
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,789
He said it should be returned.

15
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,351
They will be coming.

16
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,391
<i>(beeping)</i>

17
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,951
You bitch!

18
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,151
Beautiful!

19
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,072
<i>Avanti.</i>

20
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,957
Yes?

21
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,072
<i>Ja.</i>

22
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,074
<i>Gut.</i>

23
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,037
Gentlemen... That was
the phone call I never wanted to get.

24
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,791
- Check the bedroom.
- Clear!

25
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,871
<i>(banging)</i>

26
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,353
- What are you doing here?
- Can we talk inside?

27
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,558
I'm not feeling well. I didn't sleep last night.

28
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,428
Really not in the mood for the Three Stooges.

29
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,512
- I don't think we've been followed.
- Who would follow you?

30
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,353
A multinational black ops unit,
code-named Garnet.

31
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,318
Trained killers,
School of the Americas alumni.

32
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,868
Have you been defacing library books again?

33
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,951
They don't want <i>us.</i>

34
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,277
- They want <i>him.</i>
- Kenneth Soona?

35
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,148
- We think that's his real name.
- You've heard us call him "The Thinker".

36
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,639
What did he do?

37
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,395
Hacked into the Defense Department
computer system.

38
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,915
- Why?
- The Thinker's an anarchist and a snoop.

39
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,719
Whatever he got into has
made him a very wanted man.

40
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,430
Customs and Immigration are on full alert.
Every port of egress is closed.

41
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,159
- Why are you coming to me?
- In his last communiqué...

42
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,994
...the Thinker named a meeting place
and a three-hour time window.

43
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,197
He asked specifically for you.

44
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,510
The problem is he may already be dead.

45
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,079
<i>(gunshot)</i>

46
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,269
<i>(woman screaming)</i>

47
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,149
- What happened?
- She shot her husband. Married 30 years.

48
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,391
- Like she went crazy.
- OK, go back to your apartments.

49
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,869
We'll handle this. Excuse me, sir.

50
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,355
Weirdness.

51
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,315
I don't want you to know my real name.
I don't think it's that important that you know.

52
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,516
Sounds like a line I used in a bar once.

53
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,275
I'm sorry about the wait,
but I got this ninja party shagging my butt.

54
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,237
Why? What have you got?

55
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,030
If I'm correct, I got the original Defense
Department's UFO intelligence files.

56
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,238
- Everything from 1940s and up.
- Everything?

57
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,869
- Everything. Roswell, MJ12, and beyond.
- You've read them?

58
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,237
Not entirely. I downloaded
all I could and then I split.

59
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,675
I knew these guys were gonna be after me.

60
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,069
What makes you think
they know who you are?

61
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:41,712
I didn't take any precautions.
I mean, I didn't even expect to get inside!

62
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,916
They've always denied that these files
even existed. What do you want from me?

63
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,791
I want the truth. And I want you to promise
that those rat bastards answer to the people.

64
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,356
- Mulder, Skinner's looking for you.
- Come in and lock the door.

65
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,069
- Why? What's going on?
- Do you know the Ten Commandments?

66
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,073
- You want me to recite them?
- Just the one about obeying the Sabbath.

67
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,392
God made heaven and earth, but didn't
tell anybody about his side projects.

68
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,756
- What are you talking about?
- The biggest lie of all.

69
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,276
- What is this?
- The holy grail.

70
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,476
The original Defense Department files.

71
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,156
Evidence that the government has known
about extraterrestrials for 50 years.

72
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,837
- Where did you get this?
- Your friendly neighbourhood anarchist.

73
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,075
No. I don't believe this.

74
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,589
This is just gibberish.

75
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,190
Dammit! I'm so sick of this crap!

76
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,915
BS and double talk.

77
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,989
I can't believe this.

78
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,073
- Mulder, this may not be gibberish.
- It's ajoke, Scully. It's a bad joke!

79
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,631
I think it's just encrypted
and I think I recognise it.

80
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,030
It looks like Navajo.
It was used during World War II.

81
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,839
It was the only code
the Japanese couldn't break.

82
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,993
- I remember the long strings of consonants.
- Well, can you find out?

83
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,232
- Only a handful of people can decipher it.
- Then find one of them.

84
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,430
Mulder.

85
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,912
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. I just haven't been sleeping.

86
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,591
Sir?

87
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,720
- Agent Mulder, I need to speak with you.
- About?

88
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,234
- Agent Mulder, I need to speak with you.
- About?

89
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,113
- In my office.
- Why? Is it anotherjerk-off assignment...

90
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,829
...where I end up doing
the government's dirty work?

91
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,754
It's about a rumour that you may be
in receipt of some sensitive files.

92
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,116
- I don't know anything about that.
- Agent Mulder, listen...

93
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,599
I'm talking to you...

94
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,834
Are we finished, Agent Mulder?

95
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,911
Are we done?

96
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,115
We're done.

97
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,075
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Yes, Agent Scully. Please have a seat.

98
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,476
Agent Scully?

99
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,553
You heard about the incident
here in the hallway yesterday?

100
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,709
Yes, sir.

101
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,032
Do you have any explanation as to
Agent Mulder's bizarre behaviour?

102
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,315
No, sir.

103
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,517
Agent Mulder told me
he was having trouble sleeping.

104
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,115
Do you think Agent Mulder
confides in you, Agent Scully?

105
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,476
- Of course. He's my partner.
- Your partner?

106
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,836
Weren't you assigned to Agent Mulder
to debunk his work?

107
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,150
Yes, sir. A year and a half ago.

108
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,155
I've been writing reports stating the validity
of Agent Mulder's work on the X-Files.

109
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,949
- Would you lie to protect him?
- Am I being accused of lying?

110
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,715
Agent Mulder has been notified
of a disciplinary hearing.

111
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,759
If there's something we learn then
that you haven't stated here today...

112
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,400
...you may be subject
to the same summary action.

113
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,869
What action is that?

114
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,952
Dismissal without chance of reinstatement.

115
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,115
Is that all, sir?

116
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,395
Yes, Agent Scully. Thank you.

117
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,631
<i>(doorbell)</i>

118
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,391
Hello, Bill.

119
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:55,195
- What are you doing here?
- I've come on some pressing business.

120
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,397
- We had agreed you would never...
- That was a long time ago.

121
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,471
There have been unforeseen events.

122
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,350
No one was supposed to know.

123
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,272
Who could have predicted the future, Bill?

124
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,148
That the computers you and I only
dreamed of would be home appliances...

125
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,438
...capable of technical espionage.
- The files should have been destroyed.

126
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,913
They should have, but they weren't.
Regret is an inevitable consequence of life.

127
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,189
How do you know my son has them?

128
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,919
The man who stole them has come forward.

129
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,518
Oh, God.

130
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,792
As always, we maintain plausible denial.

131
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,873
The files are only as real as
their possible authentication.

132
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,197
- My name is in those files.
- The files have been encrypted.

133
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,431
We have a certain luxury of time.

134
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,513
We endeavoured to prevent
that fact from ever coming to light.

135
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,312
You wouldn't... harm <i>him?</i>

136
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,394
I've protected him this long, haven't I?

137
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,473
He's been provident in
the alliances he's created.

138
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,950
The last thing we need
is a martyr or a crusade.

139
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,671
But if he should... learn of my involvement?

140
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,790
You're your own man, Bill.
You always have been.

141
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,593
But I strongly encourage you in that event...

142
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,069
...to deny everything.

143
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,755
It's good to see you again, Bill.

144
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,231
You look well.

145
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,592
<i>(creaking)</i>

146
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,671
You didn't answer your door.

147
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,119
I took a pill.

148
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,988
- I couldn't find you at work. I was worried.
- I came home.

149
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,749
I must be running a fever.

150
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,275
Maybe it's the threat
of being burned at the stake.

151
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,997
They called me in today.

152
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,635
- What did you tell them?
- That nothing was wrong.

153
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,951
You told them the truth, then.

154
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,555
You opened the door for them.
They're just looking for a reason.

155
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,631
OK. I'll say I'm sorry.

156
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,508
Mulder, these files, um...
Who knows you have them?

157
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,711
- Why?
- Because I had to lie today.

158
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,678
And I put my job in jeopardy
in order to do so.

159
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,320
- If they find out...
- How would they find out?

160
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,550
Maybe they already know.

161
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,837
The question is... is it worth it?

162
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,799
- Is it worth risking everything?
- I'll tell you when I know what's on it.

163
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,270
Now just tell me who I can talk to
about breaking that code.

164
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,437
I'm meeting with somebody in an hour.

165
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,751
I might know something later tonight.

166
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:32,073
I just need some kind of assurance that
they won't let us hang ourselves with this.

167
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,549
That I'm doing the right thing.

168
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,991
I'll try to find out.

169
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,189
I need to know one more thing, Mulder.

170
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,429
Why did you attack Skinner?

171
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,515
I've thought about that, Scully.

172
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,156
I honestly can't say.

173
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,391
- This is all you have?
- Currently.

174
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,475
There are words I recognise, but you'll need
a code talker to make any sense of this.

175
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,632
I know a man who might help.
I can have him contact you.

176
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,633
Yeah, thank you. Could you tell me
which words you <i>do</i> recognise?

177
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,279
This word... it means goods, merchandise.

178
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,554
And this one means vaccination.

179
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,828
They're both modern words,
which is why they stand out.

180
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,713
Thank you. You've been very helpful.

Fox, this is your father.
I need to see you right away.

Come in.

It's...

193
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,588
It's so clear now. Simple.

194
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,549
It was so complicated then.

195
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,398
The choices that needed to be made.

196
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,834
What choices, Dad?

197
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,069
You're a smart boy, Fox.

You're smarter than I ever was.

199
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,034
About what?

200
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,395
Your politics are yours.

201
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,074
You have never thrown in.

202
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,755
The minute you do that,
their doctrines become yours.

203
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,876
And you can be held responsible.

204
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:39,115
- You're talking about the State Department.
- You're going to learn of things, Fox.

205
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,589
You're going to hear the words.

206
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,914
And they'll come to make sense to you.

207
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,988
What words?

208
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,798
The merchandise.

<i>Just tell me where you are.</i>

Mulder, were you arguing?

I didn't do it, Scully.
He was trying to tell me something.

230
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,116
- Mulder, listen to me.
- <i>You've gotta believe me, Scully.</i>

231
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,589
Mulder, I believe you. Just listen to me.

You've got to get out of there.
Leave immediately.

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,872
I can't leave the crime scene.
It'll look like I'm running.

234

- <i>Like I'm guilty.</i>
- They'll suspect you anyway.

235
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,916
<i>You've got no ID on the shooter.</i>
<i>Your behaviour has been irrational lately.</i>

<i>Mulder, can't you see that</i>
<i>everything is pointing directly at you?</i>

237
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,556
- It was somebody else's weapon.
- Mulder, you're an FBI agent!

238
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,632
You have access to weapons
other than your own.

239
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,558
- All right, meet me back at my apartment.
- No.

240
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,916
You can't come home. Someone shot through
your window tonight. Almost killed me.

241
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,833
<i>They may be trying to kill you.</i>

Oh, Mulder.

My God! Look at you, you're sick.

244
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,079
- I'm all right. I'm OK.
- No, come on. I want you to lie down.

245
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,913
No, come on. I want you to lie down.

246
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,389
Let me take your coat off.

247
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,869
We gotta find him, Scully.

248
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,958
No, you have to lie down. Over here.

249
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,998
We gotta find out who killed my father.

250
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,232
Right now you need to rest, OK?

251
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,951
Just rest.

252
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,915
There. It's OK.

253
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,671
It's OK.

254
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,231
Scully?

255
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,237
I'll compare them
when I get the bullet from the victim.

256
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,834
How long will it take
to see if they're a match?

257
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,038
They're both.9mm rounds.
Run the specs. Compare the strike.

258
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,714
We should know pretty much right away.

259
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,234
- Scully.
- You took my gun.

260
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,237
- <i>You think I did it, don't you?</i>
- I ran it through Ballistics to try to clear you.

261
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,956
- Why didn't you ask me?
- You had a temperature of 102 last night.

262
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,077
- I didn't wanna wake you.
- <i>Afraid I'd shoot you too?</i>

263
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,438
I'm being called to Skinner's office today.
I need to give them some answers.

264
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,909
To clear your conscience and your name?!

265
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,310
You've been making reports on me
since the beginning, Scully!

266
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,871
You're sick. You're not thinking straight.
I'm on your side. You know that.

267
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,396
Look. You have my files
and you have my gun.

268
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,710
Don't ask me for my trust.

269
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,791

270
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,311
Damn.

271
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,590
I'm gonna kill you anyway, Krycek,
so just tell me the truth.

272
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,069
Did you kill my father?

273
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,514
Did you kill him? Answer me!

274
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,074
- Mulder! Don't shoot him. Just back away.
- He killed my father, Scully.

275
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,879
- I have him, Mulder.
- No, Scully!

276
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,112
<i>(woman)</i> Oh, my God!
Somebody call the police!

277
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,511
He's awake.

278
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,314
Mulder?

279
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,153
Mulder, it's me.

280
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,791
Here, drink some of that.
You haven't had any water in over 36 hours.

281
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,159
Your shoulder will be fine.
The round went through nice and clean.

282
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,198
- You shot me.
- Yes, I did.

283
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,396
You didn't give me much choice.

284
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,597
- You were about to kill Krycek.
- Why shoot <i>me?</i> He's the one.

285
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,831
If he is, his weapon is
the one that killed your father.

286
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,157
- What do you mean?
- If you killed Krycek with that weapon...

287
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,631
...there would have been no way
to prove that you didn't kill your father.

288
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,116
I'm sorry about your father, Mulder.
I haven't been able to tell you.

289
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,110
How did you know it was Krycek?

290
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,830
I didn't. I went back to your apartment
to pull the slug from the wall.

291
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,993
But I noticed an unmarked van
delivering soft water.

292
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,195
And I found this in one of the tanks
servicing your building.

293
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,874
- What is it?
- It's a dialysis filter.

294
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,999
It's a device used in the transmission
of substances to solution.

295
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,437
Considering the level of psychosis
you experienced, it was possibly LSD...

296
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:16,195
...amphetamines, or some kind
of exotic dopamine agonist.

297
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,714
Oh, my God.

298
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:24,432
- There was a murder at my building.
- Well, it wasn't an exercise in subtlety.

299
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,911
These men are possibly
the same ones who killed your father...

300
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,313
...and who systematically tried to destroy you,
turning everyone you could trust against you.

301
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,994
I don't think I have to tell you why.

302
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,038
I'd gotten too close to the truth.

303
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,515
- Where are we?
- We're in Farmington, New Mexico.

304
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,160
- New Mexico?
- We drove two days across country.

305
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,834
I put you out to let
the effects of the psychosis abate.

306
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,392
This is Albert Hosteen.
He's been translating your files.

307
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,869
You're lucky she's a good shot.

308
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,391
Or a bad one.

309
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,030
Albert was a Navajo code talker
during World War II.

310
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,793
He helped encode the original documents.

311
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,916
How did you find him?

312
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,389
Through a woman in Washington.

313
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,711
But he claims that he knew you were coming.

314
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,109
Last week we had an omen.

315
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:31,593
Most files are written in jargon, but there
was an international conspiracy of silence...

316
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,716
...dating back to the 1940s.

317
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,835
Albert says that evidence of these secrets
are buried on a Navajo reservation near here.

318
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,276
He says that he'll take you
as soon as you're able.

319
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,395
What about you?

320
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,278
I'm afraid you're on your own with this.

321
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,796
I didn't show up for a meeting
with Skinner day before yesterday.

322
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,758
I don't know what the repercussions will be.

323
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,229
You've taken a big risk.

324
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,397
I was certain
they would have killed you, Mulder.

325
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,831
Thank you.

326
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,114
Thank you for taking care of me.

327
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,589
There's something else.

328
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,918
My name is in those files.

329
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,312
- It's in the latest entries with Duane Barry's.
- In what context?

330
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,029
It's not clear, but it has
something to do with a test.

331
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,748
I want you to find out, Mulder.

332
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,479
I need you to.

333
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,794
- You said you knew I was coming.
- In the desert, things find a way to survive.

334
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,916
Secrets are like this too.

335
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,755
They push their way up through the sands
of deception, so men can know them.

336
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,955
Here. This is my house.

337
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,351
But why me?

338
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,639
You are prepared to accept the truth,
aren't you? To sacrifice yourself to it?

339
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,188
I don't understand.

340
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,478
There was a tribe of Indians who
lived here more than 600 years ago.

341
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,599
Their name was Anasazi.
It means the ancient aliens.

342
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,274
No evidence of their fate exists.

343
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,273
Historians say
they disappeared without a trace.

344
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:46,593
They say that because they will not
sacrifice themselves to the truth.

345
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,875
And what is the truth?

346
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,520
Nothing disappears without a trace.

347
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,476
You think they were abducted?

348
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,074
By visitors who come here still.

349
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,353
- What's buried out there?
- Lies. You will see for yourself.

350
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,395
It's through those rocks.

351
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,076
It's down there.

352
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,911
<i>(phone rings)</i>

353
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,670
- Mulder.
- <i>You're a hard man to reach.</i>

354
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,070
- Not hard enough, apparently.
- Where are you?

355
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,074
I'm at the Betty Ford Center.
Where are you?

356
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:54,075
I need to talk to you, Mr Mulder.
In person. There are things to explain.

357
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,073
I'll save the government the plane fare.
But which government is it?

358
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,951
Your father may have told you things. I warn
you against taking those things at face value.

359
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,031
Which things are those?

360
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,908
He was never an opponent of the project.
In fact, he authorised it.

361
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,199
- <i>That's what he couldn't live with.</i>
- No. It's because you had him killed.

362
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,797
- We weren't involved in that.
- You black-lunged son of a bitch.

363
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,519
I'll expose you and your project.
Your time is up.

364
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,513
Expose anything and
you only expose your father.

<i>(helicopter)</i>

366
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,791
- Sir, we got a coordinate. We're ready to go.
- Let's go.

367
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,471
Take her up!

368
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,391
Over here.

369
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,313
- This is a boxcar.
- Refrigeration car.

370
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,311
<i>(phone rings)</i>

371
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,115
- Scully.
- Yeah, it's me.

372
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,950
Where are you?

373
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,713
Nowhere I ever expected.

374
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,711
What do you mean?

375
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,997
I'm in a boxcar buried inside a quarry.

376
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,830
There are bodies everywhere.

377
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,469
- <i>Bodies?</i>
- Stacked floor to ceiling.

378
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,472
- <i>What happened to them?</i>
- I don't know.

379
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:19,989
Mulder, in these files I found references to
experiments that were conducted in the US...

380
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,596
...by Axis-power scientists
who were given amnesty after the war.

381
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,878
- What kind of experiments?
- Some kind of tests on humans.

382
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,758
But they're referred to as merchandise.

383
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,069
But these aren't humans, Scully.

384
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,038
From the look of it, I'd say they were alien.

385
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,317
- Are you sure?
- I'm pretty damn sure.

386
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,831
Wait a second.

387
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,033
This one has a smallpox vaccination scar.

388
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,588
- Mulder...
- Oh, my God, Scully. What have they done?

389
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,678
<i>(helicopter)</i>

390
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,429
Mulder? Mulder, what happened?

391
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,795
Move out! Get away from there! You go back!

392
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,717
Cover us. We're going in!

393
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,791
Clear! Go!

394
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,953
What's your name, boy?

395
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,149
He's not here.

396
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,038
Where's Mulder?

397
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,390
- He's here.
- No, sir.

398
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,835
If he was, he's vanished without a trace.

399
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,754
Nothing vanishes without a trace. Burn it!

400
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,354
- Clear out!
- It's done.

401
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,035
Move it! Move it! Move it!

00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,915
