00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:07,454
- Mulder, where are you going ?
- To find his accomplice,
the Brazilian psychic surgeon.

331
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:12,003
I did that.
That's what I've been doing.

00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:15,996
Dr. Ken Naciamento, Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Emigrated here in 1 996.

00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:19,410
- <i>Where is he now?</i>
- <i>He's dead.</i>

334
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:23,403
- Can't be.
- Two years dead. I'm having them
fax a certificate of death.

335
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,685
- Padgett couldn't have done this alone.
- Maybe he didn't do it at all.

How else would he know it ?

337
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:34,392

like he said.

338
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,996

or Freud orJung.

maybe he has some gift...

into human nature.

person's gonna do. No one can
predict human behavior.

as a behavioral profiler ?

it's a priori, before the fact.
