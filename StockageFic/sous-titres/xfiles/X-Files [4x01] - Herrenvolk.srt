I had a biopsy taken from the smallpox

Through a process called

for the cowpox virus six,

257
00:30:14,493 --> 00:30:18,224
I was able to get this picture
of the location of a protein--

that many people in this room--

260

270

with green fields,

345
00:37:32,297 --> 00:37:34,629
and I saw my sister.

346
00:37:37,735 --> 00:37:41,796
She was just a little girl.

347
00:37:45,076 --> 00:37:48,136
I've seen too many things
not to believe.

348
00:37:49,213 --> 00:37:53,047
I've seen things, too,

349
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:56,678
but there are answers
to be found now.

350
00:37:56,754 --> 00:38:01,020
We have hope that there's a place
to start. That's what I believe.

351
00:38:01,092 --> 00:38:06,325
You put such faith
in your science, Scully, but...

352
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:09,867
the things I've seen, science
provides no place to start.

353
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:13,699
Nothing happens
in contradiction to nature,

354
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:16,262
only in contradiction
to what we know of it.

355
00:38:16,341 --> 00:38:19,242
And that’s
a place to start.

356
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:22,540
That's where the hope is.

357
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:34,490
I feel I came so close.

358
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:37,722
I feel it too.

359
00:38:37,795 --> 00:38:40,093
I know it.

360
00:38:40,198 --> 00:38:44,464
- How ?
- I was warned...

361
00:38:44,535 --> 00:38:48,369
by a man we both know,

362
00:38:48,439 --> 00:38:52,398
who I believe
knows the truth,

363
00:38:52,477 --> 00:38:57,471
who can lead us
to a place to start.

364
00:39:48,232 --> 00:39:50,496
Mr. Mulder ?

365
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:53,765
My name is Marita Covarrubias.

366
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:55,772
I am the assistant
to the special representative.

367
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,434
Was he able to review
the material I sent him ?

368
00:39:58,509 --> 00:40:00,704
- Yes.
- And will he see me ?

369
00:40:00,778 --> 00:40:05,477
I'm afraid he's been called
into something important.

370
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,417
- Can I ask who sent you here ?
- A friend.

371
00:40:08,486 --> 00:40:12,081
I've been inquiring with each
of the special representatives...

372
00:40:12,156 --> 00:40:14,420
all month about
the farmland in Canada.

373
00:40:14,492 --> 00:40:16,892
I've been trying to get some reasons,
and all I've gotten are dead ends.

374
00:40:16,961 --> 00:40:19,862
I can tell you that farm
has been abandoned.

375
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:22,957
The crops you described
were left to die.

376
00:40:23,067 --> 00:40:26,059
But they have been
identified as ginseng.

377
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:29,071
No evidence of beehives
or bee husbandry was found.

378
00:40:31,242 --> 00:40:33,802
I know it's not
the answer you wanted.

379
00:40:33,878 --> 00:40:37,780
No. I, uh--

380
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:40,784
Can I ask why this is
so important to you ?

381
00:40:43,688 --> 00:40:49,593
I have suffered-- I've suffered
some very personal losses recently and--

382
00:40:53,498 --> 00:40:56,194
I was-- I was hoping...

383
00:40:58,703 --> 00:41:01,365
that, um--

384
00:41:16,354 --> 00:41:19,016
Not everything dies,
Mr. Mulder.

385
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:39,976
[Beeping]

386
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:52,211
I need to know the reasons
why this should be.

387
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,383
[Man]
So that the work may continue,

388
00:41:56,928 --> 00:42:00,125
so that the project
may proceed unabated...

389
00:42:00,231 --> 00:42:02,199
by removing
an unnecessary obstacle.

390
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,200
What obstacle ?

391
00:42:04,268 --> 00:42:06,634
Agent Mulder, actually.

392
00:42:09,273 --> 00:42:11,833
If his mother were
to die, he would--

393
00:42:11,909 --> 00:42:13,774
He what ?

394
00:42:13,845 --> 00:42:16,678
You see,

395
00:42:16,747 --> 00:42:20,376
the fiercest enemy is the man
who has nothing left to lose.

396
00:42:22,753 --> 00:42:26,280
And you know how important
Agent Mulder is to the equation.

397
00:42:33,898 --> 00:42:35,957
