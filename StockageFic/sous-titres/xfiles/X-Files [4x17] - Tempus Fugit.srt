162
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,280
Paul Gidney. It's an alias
Max Fennig used in his letters
when he went underground.

163
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,120
He had many aliases, in fact,
one of which he used to get a job...

164
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,200
at the Rocky Flats Environmental
Energy Site in Colorado...

165
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,240
where they handle and store uranium 235
and weapons-grade plutonium.

166
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,040
Do you think Max
was carrying plutonium?

167
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,120
Mulder, the burns on that passenger's
face were deep-tissue radiation burns.

168

he might have gotten them.

- What would Max be doing with that?
- I don't know.

170
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,680
He wrote hundreds, maybe even a thousand
letters describing his abductions,

171
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,280
but beginning in January, he started
making vague references to a theft.

172
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,560
Now, it seems to me from reading
it that he started to get the idea...

that he'd come on to something
that was very dangerous.

If he was carrying
fissile plutonium, Mulder,

176

and it became exposed
in the cabin,

177
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,840
it very conceivably
could have caused the crash.

Along with Sergeant Gonzales,

00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,360

- By whom?
- My C.O.

342

Flight 549 appeared
on my radar at 1 900 hours...

343
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,440
when we were asked to give its
coordinates at 1 5-second intervals.

344
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,160
About two minutes
past 30 degrees north,

345
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,200
we saw a second aircraft enter 549's
airspace in an intercept pattern.

346
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,000
It shadowed 549
for another ten minutes...

a new set of coordinates.

A few seconds later,
there was an explosion,

349
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,760
and 549 disappeared
from my radar screen.

Unless the aircraft that was fired on
never appeared on his radar screen--

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,720
a third, unidentified aircraft
then engaged the civilian jet,
which the sergeant never saw.

A stealth aircraft?

361

Shot down by the intercept
aircraft, which in turn may have
caused the crash of flight 549,

362

which means that the cause
of this crash is not here...

- No, they didn't know
about a second aircraft.
