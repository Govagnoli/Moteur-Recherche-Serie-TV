*And Bingo was his name-o... *

13
00:00:25,205 --> 00:00:27,833
Oh! Oh, my goodness,
what's happening?

14
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:28,966
lt's okay.

15
00:00:29,076 --> 00:00:30,441
Wejust had a fat.

16
00:00:30,544 --> 00:00:32,774
- No problem here, honey.
- Oh, no.

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,920
( Sighing )

18
00:00:51,998 --> 00:00:54,057
Darn it.

19
00:01:14,588 --> 00:01:17,819
Honey, would you mind
holding the light for a second?

20
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:19,290
( Yelling )

21
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,451
Paul!

22
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:22,791
Paul?

23
00:01:22,863 --> 00:01:24,922
Paul!

24
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:31,693
Where areyou, Paul?!

25
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:33,399
What happened?!

26
00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:35,839
Paul!

27
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:37,136
Paul!

( Barking )

29
00:01:41,948 --> 00:01:43,347
Here we go, boy.

00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:46,011
( Whistling )

31
00:01:50,757 --> 00:01:52,054
Let's go over here.

32
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:00,524
Come on, boy.

33
00:02:02,068 --> 00:02:03,399
Man:
Over here!

34
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,028
We found something.

35
00:02:10,277 --> 00:02:11,744
Easy, easy, easy.

36
00:02:11,812 --> 00:02:14,804
( RetchingAndCoughing )

37
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:17,145
Man:
His leg's been eaten off.

38
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:23,612
Man:
Hey, up here!

39
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,487
( Whistling )

40
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:26,719
Come on!

41
00:02:36,303 --> 00:02:37,565
lt's in here.

42
00:02:37,637 --> 00:02:39,502
lt's as tall as a house.

43
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:40,972
We can smoke him out.

44
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,269
And then what?

45
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:46,776
l see it!

46
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:48,314
He's coming at us!

47
00:03:58,385 --> 00:03:59,750
Working hard, Mulder?

48
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,218
This woman claims...

49
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:03,483
to have been taken
aboard a spaceship...

50
00:04:03,557 --> 00:04:05,491
and held
in an antigravity chamber...

51
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:07,493
without food and water
for three days.

52
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:10,121
Antigravity is right.

53
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:11,595
Sorry to interrupt...

54
00:04:11,665 --> 00:04:14,395
your serious investigation,
but l just heard a story...

55
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:16,958
that wouldjust about
takeyour knees out.

56
00:04:17,037 --> 00:04:19,130
What's that?

57
00:04:19,205 --> 00:04:22,197
They found a body in
the NewJerseywoods yesterday...

58
00:04:22,309 --> 00:04:24,334
missing its right arm
and shoulder.

59
00:04:24,444 --> 00:04:27,971
They think they may have been
eaten offby a human.

60
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:30,015
Where in NewJersey?

61
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,550
just outside
Atlantic City.

62
00:04:31,618 --> 00:04:33,813
Not an uncommon place
to lose a body part.

63
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:35,650
Do they think
it's the mob?

64
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:37,246
lt was a homeless man.

65
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:40,316
There doesn't seem to be
a motive.

66
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:42,986
You feeling lucky, Scully?

67
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:45,190
Relative to whom?

68
00:04:45,265 --> 00:04:47,290
lt's not our case, Mulder.

69
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:49,426
The local police are handling it.

70
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:53,505
An X-file?

71
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:56,542
Ever hear ofsomething
called "TheJersey Devil"?

72
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,941
Yeah.

73
00:04:58,011 --> 00:05:00,878
A beast that comes out ofthe
woods and attacks cars, right?

74
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:02,881
Kind oflike
an East Coast Bigfoot?

75
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:05,349
Read the file
about the case in 1 947.

76
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:10,050
Save me the trouble.

77
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:13,820
1 947. Familywatches dad
get dragged into the woods.

78
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:17,021
Cops find dad
with a few appendages gnawed off.

79
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:19,793
Cops gun down a large
naked man in the woods.

80
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:22,664
Autopsy shows
human fesh and bones...

81
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:25,330
in the man's large intestine--
a beast man.

82
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:27,168
ls the autopsy report here?

83
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,673
No. The original disappeared...

84
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:31,175
from the Paterson P.D.'s files
a fewyears later.

85
00:05:31,244 --> 00:05:34,475
There is a statement
from the attending pathologist.

86
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:37,516
lt's the same story l've heard
since l was a kid.

87
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:40,246
lt's a folktale, a myth.

88
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,982
l heard the story
when l was a kid, too.

89
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:44,853
Funny thing is, l believed it.

90
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:46,050
Thanks, Lorraine.

91
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:48,788
We got a cannibalized body
in NewJersey.

92
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:51,592
Someone or something out there
is hungry.

93
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:55,397
( Sighing )

94
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:05,035
They say animals can develop
an appetite for human fesh...

95
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:06,908
but this is no animal.

96
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,813
You see the teeth marks
just below the clavicle?

97
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:11,544
They're human.

98
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:13,017
Who found the body?

99
00:06:13,086 --> 00:06:14,815
Park ranger.

100
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:16,822
Was he alive
when it happened?

101
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,587
lt's hard to tell. There's a skull
fracture, but no sign ofa struggle.

102
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,561
His blood-alcohol level was up.
Probably never knew what hit him.

103
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,097
Any ideas about that?

104
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:29,568
From the size ofthat bite mark,
l'd say a large adult male.

105
00:06:29,636 --> 00:06:32,730
Detective Tomson
is handling the case.

106
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:34,137
Glenna?

107
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,175
l'm Special Agent Dana Scully,
and this is Agent Fox Mulder.

108
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:40,212
l don't remember anybody
calling the F.B.l. in on this.

109
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:42,247
We're not here
in an official capacity.

110
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:45,773
Agent Scully is a medical doctor.
We heard aboutyourvictim.

111
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:48,183
She thought
she might take a look.

112
00:06:48,254 --> 00:06:51,451
l'm going to askyou to leave.
We have an investigation.

113
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:54,015
Tommy, this is
no time to get pissy.

114
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:55,425
We havejurisdiction.

115
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:56,826
Any suspects, Detective?

116
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:58,830
l don't work foryou, sir.

117
00:06:58,898 --> 00:07:01,196
Unless you hear different
from the attorney general...

118
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:03,098
this case is a local matter.

119
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:05,000
Agent Mulder,
we should go.

120
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:06,902
There's no need to get
bent out ofshape.

121
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:08,497
On the contrary.

122
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:11,076
l think l've been
exceedingly polite.

123
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:21,278
So what's eating that guy?

124
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:23,288
He was perfectly
in his rights.

125
00:07:23,356 --> 00:07:25,756
The F.B.l. has no
overridingjurisdiction...

126
00:07:25,825 --> 00:07:27,315
on a murder case.

127
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:28,826
You'd feel the same way...

128
00:07:28,895 --> 00:07:30,863
ifsomeone was horning in
on yourwork.

129
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,693
Chances are
he's without a clue.

130
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:34,529
He'll probably
be scratching his head...

131
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:36,535
when they bring
the next body in.

132
00:07:36,603 --> 00:07:38,537
You could have
really humiliated him...

133
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:41,005
and told him
who the perpetratorwas--

134
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:42,665
theJersey Devil.

135
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:48,903
What doyou saywe grab a hotel,
take in a foor show...

136
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:50,778
drop a few quarters
in the slot...

137
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,477
and do a little digging
on this case?

138
00:07:52,552 --> 00:07:53,484
You're kidding, right?

139
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:55,282
We can skip the foor show.

140
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:57,346
l have to be back in D.C.

141
00:07:57,423 --> 00:07:59,448
Got a date?

142
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:00,515
No.

143
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:03,585
l have my godson's
birthday party at 6:30.

144
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:08,764
What areyou doing?

145
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:10,268
A little poking around.

146
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:11,963
Maybe make a weekend
out ofit.

147
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:16,099
lt's a three-hour drive
back by myself--

148
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:18,200
in Friday-night traffic.

149
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:25,817
( CoinsJingling )

150
00:08:29,055 --> 00:08:30,955
Change for 50.

151
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:01,818
Found the body
just over there...

152
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:03,947
lying facedown on the rocks.

153
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:07,015
32 years
with the park service.

154
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:09,186
l've come across
some weird stuff...

155
00:09:09,262 --> 00:09:11,162
but never anything like this.

156
00:09:11,231 --> 00:09:13,165
The victim was a homeless man.

157
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,133
You get many ofthem out here?

158
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:17,931
Well, occasionally
l'll see some...

159
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:20,370
but most are scared
ofthe woods.

160
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,772
Scared? Ofwhat?

161
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:24,207
l don't know.

162
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:27,103
The devil.

163
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:30,048
People say that'sjust a myth.

164
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:31,913
Depends on whoyou talk to.

165
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:33,316
What doyou think?

166
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:38,990
Well, like l said,
you know, 32 years...

167
00:09:39,058 --> 00:09:40,992
l see a lot ofweird stuff.

168
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:47,766
Like one time...

169
00:09:48,868 --> 00:09:50,802
a little over fouryears ago...

170
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:56,138
l saw what l thought
was a large man...

171
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:59,269
come out ofa copse
ofbirch trees--

172
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:01,506
not a stitch ofclothing.

173
00:10:01,614 --> 00:10:03,878
He was about
60 yards away.

174
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,884
And he starts
sniffing the air...

175
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:08,182
you know, like a dog...

176
00:10:08,254 --> 00:10:10,848
and then he looks
straight at me...

177
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:13,017
and l swear he smelled me...

178
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:15,526
because he took off
into the woods so fast...

179
00:10:15,595 --> 00:10:17,426
you'd swear he wasn't human.

180
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:18,623
Really?

181
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:20,256

00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:30,786
What?

364
00:22:30,863 --> 00:22:33,423
What will happen
when the Bureau finds out?

365
00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:36,592
They dropped the charges. Tomson ran me
through the system to spite me.

366
00:22:36,702 --> 00:22:38,863
l'm talking about
thisJersey Devil.

367
00:22:38,971 --> 00:22:41,235
l saw it. lt's exactly
what the ranger described.

368
00:22:41,306 --> 00:22:43,240
The way it moved,
sniffed the air.

369
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:45,902
lt's out ofthe woods,
probably in search offood.

370
00:22:45,978 --> 00:22:47,468
l'll say.

371
00:22:47,546 --> 00:22:49,138
lt picked through the garbage.

372
00:22:49,214 --> 00:22:51,910
lfit was a man-eater,
why didn't it come after me?

373
00:22:51,984 --> 00:22:53,178
Probably felt threatened.

374
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:56,187
You're ascribing it
a motive and an alibi.

375
00:22:56,255 --> 00:22:58,485
This thing chewed
somebody's arm off.

376
00:22:58,557 --> 00:23:00,752
lt's not exactly
a defensive posture.

377
00:23:00,826 --> 00:23:03,158
Butyou do believe
l saw something?

378
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:06,459
You saw something,
but l won't go in and sell it...

379
00:23:06,565 --> 00:23:09,159
when it's nothing more than
a sighting in a dark alley.

380
00:23:09,268 --> 00:23:11,327
l'm still paying
for a hotel room.

381
00:23:11,437 --> 00:23:14,668
l have to get back
to Washington by 7:30.

382
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,207
Another birthday party?

383
00:23:17,276 --> 00:23:18,800
No.

384
00:23:18,877 --> 00:23:20,811
l have a date.

385
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,182
Can you cancel?

386
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:31,120
Unlikeyou, Mulder,
l would like to have a life.

387
00:23:32,191 --> 00:23:33,392
l have a life.

388
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:38,421
Come on. l have somebody
l wantyou to meet...

389
00:23:38,497 --> 00:23:39,759
on the way home.

390
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:40,856
Come on.

391
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:41,865
Hold on.

392
00:23:41,934 --> 00:23:45,131
just about every culture has one--

393
00:23:45,237 --> 00:23:47,967
Yeti, Sasquatch,
the Russian Almas.

394
00:23:48,073 --> 00:23:49,506
Why is that?

395
00:23:49,575 --> 00:23:52,043
lt's a universal wild man myth--

396
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:54,739
a symbolic fear ofour
dual natures as humans...

397
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:56,747
as creators oflife
and destroyers ofit.

398
00:23:56,815 --> 00:23:58,146
What's this chart?

399
00:23:58,217 --> 00:24:01,414
lt shows the historic entry
ofman onto each continent...

400
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:03,887
and the effect it had
on other animal species...

401
00:24:03,956 --> 00:24:05,617
which has been disastrous.

402
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:06,783
Why?

403
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:10,192
We humans have retained
hereditary traits...

404
00:24:10,262 --> 00:24:11,320
through evolution...

405
00:24:11,396 --> 00:24:13,990
that have proven to be
extremely destructive.

406
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:16,933
We tend to be tribal
and aggressively territorial...

407
00:24:17,002 --> 00:24:19,971
oriented by selfish sexual
and reproductive drives...

408
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:23,405
that make cooperation
beyond the family or tribe...

409
00:24:23,475 --> 00:24:25,033
extremely hard for us.

410
00:24:25,144 --> 00:24:28,272
So we kill other species
in order to survive.

411
00:24:28,347 --> 00:24:29,939
Humans are top carnivores.

412
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:32,279
We sit at the top
ofthe food chain...

413
00:24:32,351 --> 00:24:34,751
and reduce other species'
chances ofsurvival.

414
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,880
Nice to know Dana left here
with more than a degree.

415
00:24:37,956 --> 00:24:40,948
But what ifsomething
entered the food chain above us?

416
00:24:41,026 --> 00:24:42,459
lt won't happen.

417
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:44,120
Our intelligence
virtually ensures...

418
00:24:44,196 --> 00:24:47,131
that, barring the introduction
ofsome alien life-form...

419
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:49,997
we will live out our days
as rulers ofthe world.

420
00:24:50,068 --> 00:24:52,969
But what if,
through some fuke ofnature...

421
00:24:53,071 --> 00:24:54,504
a human was born...

422
00:24:54,573 --> 00:24:57,007
who reverted to its
most animal instincts?

423
00:24:57,075 --> 00:24:58,940
A kind
ofcarnivorous Neanderthal.

424
00:24:59,011 --> 00:25:01,775
Wouldn't he occupy a space
above us on the food chain?

425
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:02,779
Oh, sure.

426
00:25:02,848 --> 00:25:04,440
All he'd have to do...

427
00:25:04,516 --> 00:25:06,609
is wait outside
any fast-food restaurant...

428
00:25:06,685 --> 00:25:08,619
and eat us on the way in.

429
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:10,177
Haven't there been cases...

430
00:25:10,255 --> 00:25:13,520
where men have been raised
in the wilderness by animals...

431
00:25:13,592 --> 00:25:15,651
who have no language
and hunt like predators?

432
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:17,627
Yes, but cannibalism
is rare...

433
00:25:17,696 --> 00:25:19,129
even among lower mammals.

434
00:25:19,198 --> 00:25:21,325
But even when faced
with extinction?

435
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,392
Maybe in thejungles
of New Guinea.

436
00:25:24,469 --> 00:25:27,438
lt'sjust highly unlikely
that whatyou're suggesting...

437
00:25:27,506 --> 00:25:29,701
could have survived
civilization or evolution...

438
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:32,140
out in the woods of NewJersey?

439
00:25:32,211 --> 00:25:33,337
Highly unlikely...

440
00:25:33,412 --> 00:25:36,108
but not outside the realm
ofextreme possibility?

441
00:25:38,183 --> 00:25:41,414
Well, it would be
an amazing discovery.

442
00:26:19,057 --> 00:26:20,319
Rob:
The hard thing...

443
00:26:20,392 --> 00:26:21,984
was when mywife remarried.

444
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,756
Suddenly l felt very competitive
for my son's attention.

445
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,092
lt was weird.

446
00:26:26,164 --> 00:26:27,426
l'm sure.

447
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:30,366
l became a superdad
on the weekends with Scott.

448
00:26:30,435 --> 00:26:32,926
l had this unconscious fear
ofbeing replaced.

449
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:34,471
l actually had dreams...

450
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:38,600
where l was running over
his stepfatherwith my car.

451
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,735
You'll understand
when you have kids.

452
00:26:40,846 --> 00:26:43,041
Having kids
changes everything.

453
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:45,208
That's what they say.

454
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:48,586
Maybe some weekend
ifyou're up for it...

455
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:51,953
we could take the kids
out to the beach for the day.

456
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:53,548
Yeah.

457
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:55,024
Great.

458
00:26:55,093 --> 00:26:56,355
Thankyou.

459
00:26:58,463 --> 00:27:01,455
Can l ask about the case
you're on, or can'tyou say?

460
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:03,057
Well...

461
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,897
l don't think it's a case
we should discuss over dinner.

462
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:10,941
l don't suppose
you'd want to hear...

463
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:13,978
about the finer points
ofestate planning and taxation?

464
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:30,123
( Telephone Ringing )

465
00:27:32,831 --> 00:27:33,763
Mulder.

466
00:27:33,832 --> 00:27:35,766
AgentMulder,
this is PeterBrouillet...

467
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:37,961
oftheJersey Parks Department.

468
00:27:38,036 --> 00:27:39,298
Oh, yeah. Hi.

469
00:27:39,404 --> 00:27:41,838
l found a body
out in the woods today.

470
00:27:41,907 --> 00:27:44,467
Itlooks likeit'sbeen dead
six to eightmonths.

471
00:27:44,576 --> 00:27:45,838
A long-haired male...

472
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:48,641
missing the same tooth
l found in that rabbit.

473
00:27:48,714 --> 00:27:50,011
Could beyour devil.

474
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:51,071
Where's the body now?

475
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:53,140
I turneditover
to the coroner's offiice.

476
00:27:53,218 --> 00:27:55,152
You're sure it was a male?

477
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,017
Ithadall theplumbing.

478
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:58,078
Excuse me.

479
00:27:58,156 --> 00:27:59,214
Mm-hmm.

480
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:03,718
( Beeping )

481
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:05,057
l'm sorry.

482
00:28:09,134 --> 00:28:10,658
Excuse me.

483
00:28:10,736 --> 00:28:11,828
Certainly.

484
00:28:13,638 --> 00:28:15,367
( Ringing )

485
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:16,406
Scully.

486
00:28:16,475 --> 00:28:17,942
Mulder.

487
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:19,601
Sorrytointerruptyourevening.

488
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:21,747
That's okay. What's up?

489
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,677
l just had an amazing thought.

490
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:29,042
Maybe it isn't a beast man
we're looking for after all.

491
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:38,620
Well, ifthey picked it up...

492
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,664
nobody logged the body
on the chart.

493
00:28:40,732 --> 00:28:42,495
l sure haven't seen it.

494
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:45,195
What else would they
have done with it?

495
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,261
We called you here
for nothing.

496
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:49,830
They're going to sweep this
under the carpet.

497
00:28:49,908 --> 00:28:51,000
Why?

498
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:53,408
Any publicity, and the streets
will be crawling...

499
00:28:53,478 --> 00:28:55,878
with people who aren't here
to play craps.

500
00:28:55,947 --> 00:28:58,415
Word gets out there's something
on the loose, forget it.

501
00:28:58,483 --> 00:28:59,472
lt's a female?

502
00:28:59,551 --> 00:29:01,485
The body they found
was a male.

503
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:03,521
There's a 50-50 chance
there was a mate.

504
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:05,522
We may never know unless
we find out ourselves.

505
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,922
lfit's true, what are the chances
ofcapturing it alive?

506
00:29:08,026 --> 00:29:09,926
lfit is a primate...

507
00:29:09,995 --> 00:29:12,589
it would have
a natural fear ofheights.

508
00:29:12,697 --> 00:29:15,188
lt would also want to stay
close to its food source.

509
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,734
This thing has
no fear ofheights.

510
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:20,237
We'll start
with the lower foors.

511
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:22,569
How much time
will that dart give us?

512
00:29:22,641 --> 00:29:25,041
lt will put down
a 500-pound bear for an hour...

513
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,543
ifl hit it.

514
00:29:59,611 --> 00:30:01,841
What the hell's a park rangervehicle
doing here?

515
00:30:01,913 --> 00:30:03,175
l don't know.

516
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:05,544
Check it out.

517
00:30:09,754 --> 00:30:11,415
Run a check for me on--

518
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:34,439
Something here.

519
00:30:39,317 --> 00:30:41,342
lt's blood.

520
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:43,614
She could be bringing
her killing here.

521
00:30:43,688 --> 00:30:45,622
She could be injured.

in position.

523
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,064
What ifit is
a female, Scully?

524
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:35,034
How close is she
toyou or me?

525
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:37,040
Does she feel emotion...

526
00:31:37,108 --> 00:31:40,373
or are her daysjust spent
looking for food?

527
00:31:41,813 --> 00:31:44,247
Maybe she spends her day
shopping.

528
00:31:46,651 --> 00:31:48,585
Eight million years
out ofAfrica--

529
00:31:48,653 --> 00:31:50,848
l don't think
we're all that different.

530
00:31:53,692 --> 00:31:55,626
Mulder, we've put men
into space.

531
00:31:55,694 --> 00:31:56,718
We've built computers...

532
00:31:56,828 --> 00:31:58,819
that work faster
than the human mind.

533
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,693
While we overpopulate the world...

534
00:32:00,765 --> 00:32:03,529
and create new technologies
to kill each otherwith?

535
00:32:03,602 --> 00:32:06,036
Maybe we'rejust beasts
with big brains.

536
00:32:09,007 --> 00:32:10,304
What?

537
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,240
No, l wasjust...

538
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,710
thinking about
my godson's birthday party.

539
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:19,007
Eight little six-year-old boys

540
00:32:19,084 --> 00:32:20,881

He'sa federalagent.

543
00:32:23,955 --> 00:32:25,217
You know him?

544
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:26,222
No.

545
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,883
Whatareyoudoinghere?

546
00:32:27,993 --> 00:32:29,893
I'm aprofessor

547
00:32:29,961 --> 00:32:31,929
Mulder. Does thatsoundfamiliar?

548
00:32:31,997 --> 00:32:33,555
l know he's here somewhere.

549
00:32:33,665 --> 00:32:35,326
Will you check upstairs,
Andrew?

550
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,868
I want thisplacesearched

551
00:32:47,412 --> 00:32:49,039
Move, move!

( Metallic Banging )

553
00:33:15,573 --> 00:33:16,835
Scully:
Mulder...

554
00:33:18,943 --> 00:33:20,911
Mulder, whereareyou?

( Groaning )

558
00:36:38,276 --> 00:36:39,573
Mulder?

559
00:36:41,546 --> 00:36:42,604
( Grunting )

560
00:36:42,747 --> 00:36:44,009
Scully.

561
00:36:48,686 --> 00:36:49,948
Lay back.

562
00:36:51,256 --> 00:36:54,157
Oh, Mulder, you're hurt.

563
00:36:54,225 --> 00:36:56,193
You should have seen her.

564
00:36:56,261 --> 00:36:57,990
She was beautiful.

565
00:36:58,062 --> 00:37:01,225
Yeah, well, shejust about
ripped your lungs out.

566
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:03,699
She could have
torn my head off...

567
00:37:03,768 --> 00:37:05,702
but she sensed
l wasn't a threat.

568
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,705
l need federal jurisdiction
on this case.

569
00:37:08,773 --> 00:37:10,741
How old would you say she was?

570
00:37:10,808 --> 00:37:13,276
The U.S. Assistant D.A.
is on the phone.

571
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,574
He wants to know
what's going on.

572
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,615
Tell him he's got a real live
Neanderthal on the loose.

573
00:37:18,683 --> 00:37:20,116
She was young.

574
00:37:20,184 --> 00:37:22,118
The Atlantic City
major crime unit...

575
00:37:22,186 --> 00:37:23,448
has filed a complaint...

576
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:25,580
that we're endangering
a murder investigation.

577
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:26,919
That is such crap--

578
00:37:26,991 --> 00:37:28,925
They got her cornered
in a building.

579
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:29,960
Let's go.

580
00:37:31,529 --> 00:37:33,258
lt crawled into the wall.

581
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:34,593
Get a man in there.

582
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:35,655
Affiirmative.

583
00:37:37,368 --> 00:37:39,131
Keep these people out ofhere.

584
00:37:39,203 --> 00:37:40,602
You can take her alive.

585
00:37:40,672 --> 00:37:42,936
- ( Man Yelling )
- What's going on?

586
00:37:43,007 --> 00:37:44,599
I'vegotaman down.

587
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:47,008
A nakedwomanjustjumped
from asecond-story window.

588
00:37:47,111 --> 00:37:50,171
Suspect is headed south
into the woods on foot.

589
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,442
Good boy.

590
00:38:06,464 --> 00:38:07,726
l know these woods.

591
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:10,063
She's going for cover
down by the rocks.

592
00:38:15,773 --> 00:38:18,435
Keepyour eyes
to the left.

593
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:19,908
Stay alert.

594
00:38:23,247 --> 00:38:25,238
( Groaning )

595
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:34,484
Look.

596
00:38:38,262 --> 00:38:40,196
Can you reach her
from here?

597
00:38:40,264 --> 00:38:41,788
l can try.

598
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:50,007

599
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:18,566

( Men Yelling )

602
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,838
Man:
l got it!

603
00:39:29,947 --> 00:39:31,073
Good shot.

604
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:34,784
She tried to take my arm off.

605
00:39:38,856 --> 00:39:40,915
Man: Looks like she tried
to bury herself.

606
00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:12,655
Why did you have to kill her?

607
00:40:14,726 --> 00:40:17,559
Same reason you kill
a rabid animal.

608
00:40:30,675 --> 00:40:33,667
( Sighing )

609
00:40:58,770 --> 00:40:59,862
Hi.

610
00:40:59,937 --> 00:41:01,404
Thisjust came through.

611
00:41:01,472 --> 00:41:04,236
lt's a posthumous medical exam
ofthe woman's body.

612
00:41:04,308 --> 00:41:06,435
They found fragments
ofhuman bone...

613
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:08,445
still in
her digestive tract.

614
00:41:08,513 --> 00:41:11,778
They estimated her age
to be 25 to 30 years.

615
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:14,909
They allowed Dr. Diamond
to do a medical exam ofthe body...

616
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:16,247
but he found nothing...

617
00:41:16,354 --> 00:41:19,084
that suggested
prehistoric bone structure...

618
00:41:19,157 --> 00:41:21,022
or physiology.

619
00:41:21,092 --> 00:41:24,323
The A.C.P.D. has her
listed as aJane Doe...

620
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:26,329
in a search
for her identity...

621
00:41:26,397 --> 00:41:29,366
and state psychiatric records
has begun in earnest.

622
00:41:29,433 --> 00:41:30,525
Good luck.

623
00:41:30,601 --> 00:41:33,195
They have also released
the medical exam...

624
00:41:33,271 --> 00:41:35,239
from the male body
that they found.

625
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:38,537
His age is estimated
to be about 40 years.

626
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,544
There would have been offspring.

627
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,041
The medical exam
ofthe woman's uterus...

628
00:41:45,116 --> 00:41:47,607
seems to indicate that
she may have given birth.

629
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:50,119
She was protecting her children.
lt all makes sense.

630
00:41:50,188 --> 00:41:51,382
The male dies...

631
00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:53,923
and she comes out ofthe woods
in search offood.

632
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:55,083
Do me a favor.

633
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:58,060
Go out and have a beer.
Take the day off.

634
00:41:58,129 --> 00:41:59,187
l'll cover foryou.

635
00:41:59,263 --> 00:42:01,254
just take some time
foryourself.

636
00:42:01,332 --> 00:42:03,323
Thanks, but l've got
an appointment...

637
00:42:03,401 --> 00:42:05,335
at the Smithsonian
with an ethnobiologist.

638
00:42:05,403 --> 00:42:08,031
- ( Telephone Ringing )
- l can't wait to tell him.

639
00:42:08,105 --> 00:42:09,231
Mulder.

640
00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:12,674
Yeah,just a second.
lt's foryou.

641
00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:18,772

for Cirque du Soleil.

646

647
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,627

648
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:39,466

649
00:42:39,537 --> 00:42:40,834
Thankyou.

650
00:42:48,546 --> 00:42:50,537
Who was that on the phone?

651
00:42:50,615 --> 00:42:51,707
A guy.

652
00:42:51,782 --> 00:42:54,808
Same guyyou had dinnerwith
the other night?

653
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:56,045
Same guy.

654
00:42:56,153 --> 00:42:58,212
You going to have dinner
with him again?

655
00:42:58,322 --> 00:42:59,584
l don't think so.

656
00:42:59,657 --> 00:43:00,851
No interest.

657
00:43:00,925 --> 00:43:02,187
Not at this time.

658
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,591
Thanks, Fran.

659
00:43:04,729 --> 00:43:06,026
What areyou doing?

660
00:43:06,097 --> 00:43:08,031
Going with you
to the Smithsonian.

661
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:09,691
Don'tyou have a life?

662
00:43:09,767 --> 00:43:11,860
Keep that up
and l'll hurtyou...

663
00:43:11,936 --> 00:43:13,267
like that beast woman.

664
00:43:13,337 --> 00:43:15,328
Eight million years
out ofAfrica.

665
00:43:15,406 --> 00:43:17,340
And lookwho's
holding the door.

666
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,118
Dad, did youjust see
something down there?

667
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:29,186
Where?

668
00:43:29,287 --> 00:43:30,254
Over there.

669
00:43:30,354 --> 00:43:32,288
No. l'm sure
it was nothing.

670
00:43:32,356 --> 00:43:33,414
No. l saw something.

671
00:43:33,524 --> 00:43:35,685
Did you ever hear the story
oftheJersey Devil?

672
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,193
When l was a kid...

673
00:43:37,261 --> 00:43:39,923
my dad used to tell this story
about a creature...

674
00:43:39,997 --> 00:43:41,988
who lived out there
in the woods.

675
00:43:42,066 --> 00:43:44,125
lt was halfman, halfanimal.

676
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:45,862
l used to believe--
