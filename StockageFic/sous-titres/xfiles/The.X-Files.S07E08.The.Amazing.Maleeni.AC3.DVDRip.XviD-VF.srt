1
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,626
Mr. Maleeni.

2
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,855
Hey, guy.
You ready to rumble?

3
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:33,763
If by "rumble" you mean perform,
yes, I am.

4
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:37,462
Cool. You know how he said
you get 125 for the day?

5
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,472
It's gonna be 75 instead.
The gate's for crap.

6
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,737
But, hey, the show's
gotta go on, right?

7
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,769
- This will be my greatest show ever.
- Right on.

8
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:54,643
Ladies and gentlemen,
damas y caballeros,

9
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,817
I aim today not just
to entertain but to educate,

10
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:03,625
to instruct and inform
in the venerable...

11
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:07,462
- And ancient history of my art.

12
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,695
UntilJohann Nepomuk Hofsinzer...

13
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,795
called playing cards
the poetry of magic,

14
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:17,400
a conjuror's skill was determined
entirely by his ability...

15
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,945
to perform one effect.

16
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:23,312
That effect was known
as the cups and balls.

17
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:27,251
The games were known for hundreds,
if not thousands of years.

18
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,120
Perhaps the greatest performer
was the Italian Bartolomeo Bosco.

19
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:34,160
Get on with it.

20
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:41,723
Bosco's passes
with the cups and balls.

21
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,204
Wah-day...

22
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,043
chubio...

23
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,814
colerader.

24
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,816
Three gone...

25
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:01,684
and yet three... return.

26
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,847
Bosco had only one
contemporary rival,

27
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:08,053
a slightly older Frenchman named Conus,
who announced in 1795...

28
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,724
that he would make his wife,
who was five-foot seven,
appear under one of the cups.

29
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,860
Practice though I have,
I have been unable even to get married.

30
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,701
Conus placed one ball in his pocket.

31
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,244
He put the second ball away.

32
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,475
Putting the third ball in his hand,
he made it vanish,

33
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,483
and that's the mystery...

34
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:35,578
of the cups and the balls.

35
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:42,751
Yo! Can't you do anything
that ain't a hundred years old?

36
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,321
That ain't old school,
that's decrepit.

37
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,459
Young man, shall I come
heckle you on your job?

38
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,994
Make sure you count out
the requisite number of McNuggets?

39
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:56,166
Show me somethin'.

40
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:59,541
Come on.
Show me somethin'.

41
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:07,015
A callow challenge to be met
by experience and skill.

42
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:10,385
To wit,
the Egyptian Dedi,

43
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:13,016
whose most
celebrated feat...

44
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:16,357
was to reattach
a recently severed head,

45
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:20,058
reuniting it with
the still-warm body...

46
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,693
and no harm done.

47
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,862
Western history knows...

48
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,907
three previous attempts
at recreating...

49
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,738
this Noachian feat,

50
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,906
each of the three
ending in tragedy.

51
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,973
This will be the fourth.

52
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,817
May I have complete silence,
please?

53
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,398
- Yeah!

54
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:02,464
Senor Maleeni!
Ho ho!

55
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:06,740
Folks, let's give it up
for the Amazing Maleeni.

56
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:17,181
Guy, you rock. That kicked ass.
I mean, it looked completely real.

57
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,248
How did you do that?

58
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,816
Oh, yeah, right.
Magic.

59
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,390
Oh, hey, your money.
Hold up.

60
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:34,298
Two, four, fifty, fifty-five, sixty,
sixty-five, seventy, seventy-five.

61
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:37,866
You earned it.
Mr. Maleeni?

62
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,613
Mr. Maleeni.

63
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,312
Oh, God! Oh...

64
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:44,408
Whew.

65
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:54,348
- Neat trick, huh?
- I can think of a neater one...

66
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,048
how you convinced me to drop everything
and get on the first plane
to Los Angeles.

67
00:05:58,123 --> 00:06:00,853
Come on, Scully.
This isn't intriguing enough for you?

68
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:04,759
A magician turns his head
completely around, 360 degrees,

69
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:06,888
to the delight of young and old alike,

70
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:10,332
after which it plops
unceremoniously onto the pier.

71
00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:13,769
- See the picture?
- Yeah, I saw the picture.

72
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:17,069
And as for this Amazing Maleeni
turning his head all the way around...

73
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:19,235
Like you said, Mulder, neat trick.

74
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:24,270
- But?
- But... I'd guess this event...

75
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:27,341
was completely removed
from his subsequent murder.

76
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,820
- You think this was a murder?
- Don't you?

77
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:33,119
Mulder, his head was cut off.

78
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:36,422
Ah. Observe the nearly
complete absence of blood.

79
00:06:36,494 --> 00:06:40,624
Observe the paucity of fingerprints,
as evidenced by the L.A.P.D. 's
liberal use...

80
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:44,156
- Of lycopodium powder.
- Why are you talking like Tony Randall?

81
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:47,898
Know that the Amazing Maleeni was alive
one moment and expired the next.

82
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:52,238
Know also that no one
saw his fleeing attacker,
nor heard the dying man's cries.

83
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,778
Mulder, I admit that I
don't know how it happened,

84
00:06:54,846 --> 00:06:58,304
but I still say that it was a murder.

85
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:02,945
- So what's your theory?
- A magic trick gone horribly wrong.

86
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:05,182
One that claims the lives
of all who attempt it.

87
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:07,850
Can I see that camcorder again?

88
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,351
Thank you.

89
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:14,262
A tourist videotaped...

90
00:07:14,332 --> 00:07:16,266
Maleeni's performance.

91
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:20,237
This...

92
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:24,603
That ain't old school, that's decrepit.

93
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:26,507
-  Show me somethin'.
- Who's the heckler?

94
00:07:26,578 --> 00:07:29,445
Come on. Show me somethin'.

95
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:32,108
I don't know.

96
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:42,656
Neat trick, huh?

97
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:44,991
Hang on a second. Let me see this.

98
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:51,995
That heckler's pretty hard to impress,
wouldn't you say?

99
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:56,069
Look at him.
He just takes off in a huff.

100
00:07:56,141 --> 00:08:00,475
- You think he's a murderer?
- It's worth checking out,
don't you think?

101
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:04,174
I don't know. That'd be a neat trick
in itself. You never see his face.

102
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:06,410
Ah! But observe.

103
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:11,452
His discarded soda cup.

104
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:14,356
The hand may be quicker than the eye,
but it still leaves fingerprints.

105
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:18,156
- Provided they haven't dumped the trash.
- Skeptic.

106
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,677
Mr. LaBonge?

107
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,507
We're agents Mulder and Scully
from the F.B.I.

108
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,877
Were you at the Santa Monica Pier
yesterday morning?

109
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:45,889
Yeah.

110
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:49,393
You attended a magic show,
the Amazing Maleeni?

111
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:52,395
Yeah, he sucks.
Why?

112
00:08:52,463 --> 00:08:56,263
He's dead, under extremely
suspicious circumstances.

113
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:59,569
He still sucks.

114
00:08:59,637 --> 00:09:04,006
- How'd you find me?
- Your fingerprints.

115
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:08,375
- You have a criminal record.
- A conviction for pickpocketing.

116
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:13,247
Man, that was performance art.
Besides, it's ancient history.

117
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:15,616
What are you saying?
You think I killed him?

118
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:18,952
Well, you're on videotape
heckling the deceased.

119
00:09:19,023 --> 00:09:21,253
What did you have against
Mr. Maleeni?

120
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,295
First of all,
his name's not Maleeni.

121
00:09:30,368 --> 00:09:32,563
That's the name
of a real magician,

122
00:09:32,637 --> 00:09:35,128
a guy at the turn of the century,
Max Malini.

123
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:37,299
- Ever hear of him?
- No.

124
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,468
It's too bad.
You should've.

125
00:09:39,544 --> 00:09:42,570
Anyway, he steals his name,
spells it a little differently...

126
00:09:42,647 --> 00:09:45,673
and he does some tired crap
that wouldn't cut it
at a kid's birthday party.

127
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,413
What about the trick where he
turns his head completely around?

128
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:51,421
Check it out.

129
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:27,986
No problem.
Did you like that?

130
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:30,186
- Yeah.
- Watch.

131
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:36,794
A coin in the hand...
blows away.

132
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:40,462
Maybe it's a little bit
hard for you to see.

133
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:46,000
Let me make that...
bigger for you.

134
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:50,070
Great, but I don't see how
they're any different or better
than the ones Maleeni did.

135
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:52,514
Mozart and Salieri.

136
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:57,553
They sound pretty much
the same to a layman.

137
00:10:57,622 --> 00:11:01,422
But they ain't.
You know what I'm sayin'?

138
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:06,488
It's about originality.

139
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:10,260
Style.

140
00:11:12,603 --> 00:11:15,163
And more than
anything else...

141
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:18,072
soul.

142
00:11:18,142 --> 00:11:21,407
Because that's what separates
the great ones...

143
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,014
from the hacks.

144
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:30,010
We can't do this halfway. We're dealing
with powerful forces at work here.

145
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:33,956
Energies far beyond
our mere...

146
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:38,257
mortal... understanding.

147
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,021
Enough to make a magician
lose his head?

148
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,625
Could be.

149
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:49,634
That, and I hear Maleeni racked up
some pretty big gambling debts.

150
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:54,201
Who knows who he
might've pissed off.

151
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:57,907
Thank you, Mr. LaBonge.
We'll, uh, be in touch.

152
00:11:57,982 --> 00:12:00,917
Please do.
Oh, and agents?

153
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:19,434
Mozart and Salieri.
Which one's which?

154
00:12:19,504 --> 00:12:21,665
Mulder, I think that
professional jealousy...

155
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:23,832
is as good a motive
for murder as any.

156
00:12:23,908 --> 00:12:26,172
If it was a murder.
I'm not convinced.

157
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:29,905
If I can get Mr. Maleeni
into an autopsy bay,

158
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:32,415
hopefully we can put this issue
to rest as soon as possible.

159
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:40,521
All right, I'm stumped.
I think I'm supposed to be.

160
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:44,359
- What do you think?
- Well, first of all,

161
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:47,330
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but Mr. Maleeni's head...

162
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:49,593
didn't just
magically fall off.

163
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:52,295
It was very
carefully sawed.

164
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,032
Very slow
and exacting work,

165
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:57,768
probably with
a fine-tooth meat saw.

166
00:12:57,842 --> 00:13:00,333
And check out
this little detail.

167
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:06,445
Spirit gum, Mulder.

168
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:09,350
It held the head
to the body.

169
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,878
- Just barely, of course.
- So he was murdered?

170
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:17,155
Well, no. As far as I can tell, this man
died of advanced coronary disease.

171
00:13:17,228 --> 00:13:20,629
- Natural causes.
- Yeah.

172
00:13:20,698 --> 00:13:23,565
So basically, he died of a heart attack,
somebody crept up behind him,
sawed his head off...

173
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:26,501
and then glued it back on all in
the space of 30 seconds.

174
00:13:26,571 --> 00:13:28,904
- Does that make sense to you?
- No.

175
00:13:29,037 --> 00:13:31,870
Which makes it
even stranger still,

176
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,999
because as far
as I can tell...

177
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:36,976
this body has been dead
for over a month.

178
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:39,206
I see signs
of refrigeration.

179
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:41,374
And yet he performed yesterday.

180
00:13:42,884 --> 00:13:46,479
- What a trouper.
- Well, somebody performed yesterday.

181
00:14:11,346 --> 00:14:13,780
Cissy Alvarez.

182
00:14:13,848 --> 00:14:17,648
Who are you?

183
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:22,281
You don't remember me.
Ain't that a bitch?

184
00:14:22,357 --> 00:14:27,351
My name's LaBonge. I did time
with you about eight years ago.

185
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:31,889
- You were in for bank robbery.
- The name doesn't mean anything.
What do you want?

186
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:34,128
I hear you're
a poker player.

187
00:14:34,202 --> 00:14:37,296
You won big off a guy who
calls himself the Amazing Maleeni.

188
00:14:37,372 --> 00:14:40,398
Also goes by the name
of Herman Pinchbeck.

189
00:14:43,478 --> 00:14:46,572
- Pinchbeck?
- He's dead.

190
00:14:46,648 --> 00:14:48,843
Yeah, I saw in the paper.

191
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:52,478
Something about his head fell off.
Yeah. What's it to you?

192
00:14:54,456 --> 00:14:57,755
I'm the guy that
made his head fall off.

193
00:15:00,395 --> 00:15:03,660
You took his marker, right?
What'd he owe you, 15 grand?

194
00:15:03,732 --> 00:15:07,429
- Twenty.
- I don't think he was
ever gonna pay you back.

195
00:15:07,502 --> 00:15:09,595
You want to cut
to the chase?

196
00:15:09,671 --> 00:15:12,162
You know, get a little more of your
story out before we stomp you to death?

197
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,802
How would you like to get back
what you're owed times ten?

198
00:15:16,878 --> 00:15:19,847
200,000. Mm. How?

199
00:15:19,914 --> 00:15:22,940
- Helping me.
- Do what?

200
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:24,451
Magic.

201
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:45,272
Wanna hear more?

202
00:16:11,866 --> 00:16:14,858
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Mr. Albert Pinchbeck.

203
00:16:14,936 --> 00:16:17,905
- He's the gentleman right over there.
The poor man.
- Ah.

204
00:16:26,114 --> 00:16:29,481
- He look familiar to you, Scully?
- He certainly does.

205
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,617
- The plot thickens.
- He might try and run.

206
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,427
Come in.

207
00:16:41,496 --> 00:16:47,093
- Good morning, Mr. And Mrs...
- Agents Mulder and Scully, F.B.I.

208
00:16:47,168 --> 00:16:50,365
You're not here for a home loan,
I take it.

209
00:16:50,438 --> 00:16:53,339
No. We are investigating
the death of a magician...

210
00:16:53,408 --> 00:16:55,501
who called himself
the Amazing Maleeni.

211
00:16:55,577 --> 00:16:58,341
Herman Pinchbeck,
my twin brother.

212
00:16:58,413 --> 00:17:01,541
Yes, we know.
We checked his next of kin.

213
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:04,517
- What happened to your neck,
Mr. Pinchbeck?
- I was in a car accident.

214
00:17:04,586 --> 00:17:07,384
Car accident.

215
00:17:07,455 --> 00:17:10,083
So your injured neck has nothing
to do with a magic trick...

216
00:17:10,158 --> 00:17:12,149
you performed at the Santa Monica Pier
two days ago,

217
00:17:12,227 --> 00:17:15,253
one which involved you turning your head
around 360 degrees?

218
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,958
Well, no.
That wasn't me.

219
00:17:18,032 --> 00:17:20,296
I was in a bad car accident
in Mexico.

220
00:17:20,368 --> 00:17:23,428
A bad Mexican car accident
in Mexico.

221
00:17:23,505 --> 00:17:27,464
- Do you know magic, Mr. Pinchbeck?
- Yes, I do.

222
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:30,807
Back in the '70s,
my brother and I performed together.

223
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,746
- Why'd you stop?
- You never really stop.

224
00:17:41,956 --> 00:17:44,322
Pick a card, any card?

225
00:18:08,082 --> 00:18:10,175
Hmm.

226
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:13,516
- Very impressive.
- My brother and I both wanted to do...

227
00:18:13,588 --> 00:18:17,024
the absolute best magic
the world had ever seen.

228
00:18:17,091 --> 00:18:19,286
The difference was,
I knew we'd never get there,

229
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,453
but he always
believed we would.

230
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:24,987
We didn't talk much
after I quit the act.

231
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:29,526
I have a theory, Mr. Pinchbeck,
and I'm gonna tell you how it goes.

232
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:33,871
I think that your brother Herman
died of heart disease...

233
00:18:33,942 --> 00:18:36,274
having never made it as
the world's greatest magician.

234
00:18:36,344 --> 00:18:39,871
I think that hurt you, just as
your estrangement from him hurt you.

235
00:18:39,948 --> 00:18:43,611
I think what you did was perform
his last act for him.

236
00:18:43,685 --> 00:18:46,552
One last act for which
he'd always be remembered.

237
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:49,954
One last act that would end with
such a shock, such a denouement,

238
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:52,857
as would be forever remembered
in the annals of magic.

239
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,964
That's what I think.

240
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:01,527
I so wish that were true.

241
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,574
It was a very bad car accident
in Mexico.

242
00:19:20,455 --> 00:19:22,889
- Oy!
- No kidding.

243
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,892
What now?

244
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,520
A guy's head falls off,
it's the greatest trick in the world.

245
00:19:28,596 --> 00:19:30,689
When there's no
discernible point to it,

246
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:33,029
what's the reason for doing
that in the first place?

247
00:19:33,101 --> 00:19:37,834
Well, why do people do magic? To
impress, to delight, to gain attention.

248
00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:40,430
Well, this one's gaining
mostly police attention.

249
00:19:42,143 --> 00:19:44,077
Maybe that's the point.

250
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,746
Well, maybe we should
consult an expert...

251
00:19:47,815 --> 00:19:52,218
someone who knows magic, who's seen
the greatest trick in the world.

252
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:54,448
Maybe he can help us
figure that out.

253
00:19:54,522 --> 00:19:56,581
- Mozart.
- Yeah.

254
00:19:56,658 --> 00:19:58,592
What's in it for me?

255
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,255
I mean, let's say I help you out.
What do I get in return?

256
00:20:04,198 --> 00:20:08,601
The feeling of pride that comes
from performing your civic duty?

257
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,366
How 'bout the chance...

258
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:15,569
to root through the professional secrets
of your least favorite magician?

259
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:19,371
Good for a laugh, I guess.

260
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:42,694
Man, it's worse
than I thought.

261
00:20:47,675 --> 00:20:50,803
You gotta feed those things,
you know.

262
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:52,812
So...

263
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,115
- Maleeni wasn't murdered.
- It would seem not.

264
00:20:59,187 --> 00:21:02,486
So someone impersonated him
and his crappy act.

265
00:21:02,557 --> 00:21:04,582
It's impressive.

266
00:21:10,498 --> 00:21:12,762
I'd say the twin brother did it,
but I don't think...

267
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:15,029
he's any better a magician
than Maleeni was.

268
00:21:15,103 --> 00:21:18,800
There's that,
and he's got no legs.

269
00:21:21,075 --> 00:21:22,408
Yeah. Whatever.

270
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:24,171
Yeah. Whatever.

271
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:29,340
Anyway, we're looking for a magician
with the same height and build.

272
00:21:29,415 --> 00:21:32,680
A good makeup job and the right wig,
and no one would know the difference.

273
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,981
Not even you, I guess.

274
00:21:35,053 --> 00:21:37,351
I had a couple of
Jell-O shots in me.

275
00:21:37,423 --> 00:21:40,984
Hey, how did this impersonator
switch out the dead body?

276
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:46,326
With ease. You're gonna kick yourselves
when I show you how he did this,
it's so simple.

277
00:21:46,398 --> 00:21:51,665
Because magic is all about...
misdirection.

278
00:21:53,639 --> 00:21:57,769
Your impersonator simply made sure
everyone was looking the other way...

279
00:21:57,843 --> 00:22:02,143
when he pulled Maleeni's body
from its secret hiding place...

280
00:22:02,214 --> 00:22:04,148
underneath...

281
00:22:05,217 --> 00:22:07,151
the floor.

282
00:22:28,607 --> 00:22:32,168
Man, this guy's good.

283
00:22:33,745 --> 00:22:36,942
Well, thanks for
your expert opinion.

284
00:22:37,015 --> 00:22:40,109
I guess we're right back
where we started.

285
00:22:40,185 --> 00:22:42,915
Maybe not.

286
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:46,355
You said that, uh, the Amazing Maleeni
had some gambling debts?

287
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:48,450
Yeah, that's what I heard.

288
00:22:48,527 --> 00:22:50,859
Check this out.
Looks like a marker.

289
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:53,295
$20,000. Pinchbeck.

290
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:59,432
What would this be doing
in Maleeni's van?

291
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:15,319
Thank you, Mr. Pinchbeck.

292
00:23:15,387 --> 00:23:17,878
If you could
sign here for me.

293
00:23:17,956 --> 00:23:19,890
With pleasure.

294
00:23:22,127 --> 00:23:27,224
- Anthony, what kind of gun is that?
- Glock 17,.9 millimeter.

295
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,927
I've been thinking of maybe
buying one since my accident.

296
00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:32,470
Well, here. Take a look.

297
00:23:37,075 --> 00:23:39,009
Hmm.

298
00:23:39,077 --> 00:23:42,308
- Gosh, it's heavier
than I would've thought.

299
00:23:45,918 --> 00:23:48,648
Thank you,
Anthony, Marvin.

300
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,847
- If you ever want,
I'll take you to the shooting range.

301
00:23:50,923 --> 00:23:53,357
- Hmm.
- Have a good one, Mr. Pinchbeck.

302
00:23:53,425 --> 00:23:55,359
You too.

303
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,104
Hello, may I help you?

304
00:24:17,783 --> 00:24:20,877
- Damn, you look just like him.
- I'm sorry?

305
00:24:20,953 --> 00:24:24,081
Your no-good,
malapaga brother...

306
00:24:24,156 --> 00:24:26,488
died owing me money...

307
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:28,958
a lot of money.

308
00:24:29,027 --> 00:24:31,120
- You're gonna make good.
- I'm sorry,

309
00:24:31,196 --> 00:24:33,721
but my, uh, brother's debts
are his own.

310
00:24:35,801 --> 00:24:40,295
I said,
you're gonna make good,

311
00:24:40,372 --> 00:24:42,738
'cause me and my friends,
we know where you live.

312
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,329
- That sound like the rear diff?
- Pull over.

313
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:12,402
Stay here and call it in.
I'll check it out.

314
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:15,838
We got a problem with the rear diff.
We're on Fourth and Main.

315
00:25:15,907 --> 00:25:18,000
Checking it out is Anthony.

316
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:38,126
You! In the truck!
Get up where I can see you.

317
00:25:38,196 --> 00:25:41,188
Hands where
I can see them!

318
00:25:41,266 --> 00:25:43,598
Up! Hands up.

319
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:45,694
All right. Get out.

320
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:47,966
Mister, get out...

321
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:53,106
Hey, I got a guy down
back here!

322
00:25:57,783 --> 00:26:00,809
It was a guy with tattoos!
I shot him four times!

323
00:26:03,655 --> 00:26:07,147
I don't understand.
He was right here.

324
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:26,573
It's your handwriting, is it not?

325
00:26:30,248 --> 00:26:32,739
Mr. Alvarez,
please answer the question.

326
00:26:32,818 --> 00:26:35,753
That ain't mine.
I don't know where you got that.

327
00:26:35,821 --> 00:26:38,085
It's interesting.
Yours are the only fingerprints on it.

328
00:26:38,156 --> 00:26:41,592
We ran it through the
California Criminal History Database,

329
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,356
to which you seem to be
quite well known.

330
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:46,761
So it's my marker.

331
00:26:46,832 --> 00:26:51,201
So Pinchbeck owed me money.
It was a friendly game of poker.

332
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:55,296
Very friendly.
$20,000 friendly.

333
00:26:55,373 --> 00:26:59,469
- Where did you find that?
- In Herman Pinchbeck's van.

334
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:03,180
Where were you
last Thursday?

335
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:06,809
Here. All day. Ask 'em.

336
00:27:10,522 --> 00:27:13,855
What is it you think I did
to Pinchbeck, huh?

337
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:18,453
What's in it for me?
If I kill him, he ain't gonna pay me.

338
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:22,022
Why did you play with him
in the first place?
You knew he was a professional magician.

339
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,466
I didn't know what he was.

340
00:27:24,536 --> 00:27:27,369
And he sure as hell
couldn't play worth a damn.

341
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,498
Don't leave town,
Mr. Alvarez.

342
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,449
Don't you find it odd that the
Amazing Maleeni's a lousy poker player?

343
00:27:45,524 --> 00:27:49,585
- This is a guy who's adept
at manipulating cards.
- Maybe he wasn't so adept.

344
00:27:49,661 --> 00:27:54,689
- LaBonge certainly doesn't have
a high opinion of his skills.
- There's another possibility.

345
00:27:54,766 --> 00:27:57,860
Behold... an ordinary
household quarter.

346
00:27:57,936 --> 00:28:01,337
I'm going to take the quarter
from my right hand
and place it into my left hand.

347
00:28:01,406 --> 00:28:03,499
- Where is it?
- It's in your right hand.

348
00:28:03,575 --> 00:28:06,009
No, no, no.
Ahh-ahh!

349
00:28:06,077 --> 00:28:08,568
- That's not bad. Mulder...
- Blow your nose, Scully.

350
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:11,047
- Blow your nose. Come on. Blow.
- Achoo.

351
00:28:11,116 --> 00:28:13,607
- Ta-da! Look at that.
The Great Muldeeni.
- Amazing!

352
00:28:13,685 --> 00:28:17,519
- What's the point?
- Misdirection. It's the heart of magic,
like LaBonge said.

353
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:19,716
I made you look in one direction,
the quarter went in the other.

354
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:22,521
That's what you think's
happening in this case?

355
00:28:22,594 --> 00:28:25,392
I think we're being
led around by our noses.

356
00:28:25,463 --> 00:28:29,263
- By whom? Maleeni's already dead.
- It certainly would appear so.

357
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:32,394
But then again, you thought the quarter
was in the right hand.

358
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:56,359
911 emergency.
- Yeah, hello?

359
00:28:56,428 --> 00:29:00,421
Yeah, I want to report a man with a gun.
He's threatening to kill somebody.

360
00:29:00,498 --> 00:29:04,093
- Can you please speak up?
- No, I can't speak up. No, I can't!

361
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:06,103
Sir?

362
00:29:07,906 --> 00:29:11,575
Hello? Hello?

363
00:29:13,777 --> 00:29:15,938
Son of a bitch.

364
00:29:22,485 --> 00:29:25,682
Hey, partner.
Hey, guys.

365
00:29:25,755 --> 00:29:28,747
- You son of a bitch.
- I'm sorry?

366
00:29:28,825 --> 00:29:31,760
You tried to frame me.

367
00:29:31,828 --> 00:29:34,023
- I didn't!
- Oh, you didn't, huh?
- Wait! We've got a deal!

368
00:29:34,097 --> 00:29:37,430
- We got no deal.
I'm gonna bleed you, you little bitch.
- Back off.

369
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:46,003
- You're dead.

370
00:29:49,713 --> 00:29:51,681
Freeze!

371
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,807
Drop your weapon.

372
00:29:55,218 --> 00:29:58,210
Hands behind your head.
Do it!

373
00:29:59,856 --> 00:30:02,882
Put your hand down.
Spread your legs.

374
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:14,995
Agents.
An unexpected surprise.

375
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:18,165
- Good afternoon.
- We'd like to have a word with you,
Mr. Pinchbeck.

376
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:21,733
- I'm fairly busy, actually.
- I'll bet.

377
00:30:21,811 --> 00:30:24,245
- Hey! What?
- Let's take a little spin, shall we?

378
00:30:32,222 --> 00:30:37,057
- What's this all about?
- It's about misdirection, Mr. Pinchbeck.

379
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:40,221
Or should I say
the Amazing Maleeni?

380
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,389
Mulder!

381
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,094
It's a trick, Scully.
Voila.

382
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,934
Had you fooled.

383
00:30:50,006 --> 00:30:52,941
- You're Maleeni?
- Call me Herman.

384
00:31:02,352 --> 00:31:04,445
I was afraid for my life.

385
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:07,388
That's why I did what I did.
I'm not proud of that.

386
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:12,520
But I owe a lot of money
that I can't possibly pay back.

387
00:31:12,595 --> 00:31:16,395
We know... gambling debts
to a man named Alvarez.

388
00:31:16,466 --> 00:31:18,696
Yeah, that tattooed psychopath.

389
00:31:18,768 --> 00:31:21,032
I've since heard
terrible stories about him,

390
00:31:21,104 --> 00:31:23,538
things he did in prison
to fellow inmates.

391
00:31:23,606 --> 00:31:27,975
- So why'd you play poker with him?
- He runs a good game.

392
00:31:28,044 --> 00:31:32,413
I gamble to supplement my income.
God knows, magic barely pays.

393
00:31:32,482 --> 00:31:36,077
Why did you lose? You could've
manipulated the cards, right?

394
00:31:36,152 --> 00:31:39,781
Cheat? You're asking why
I don't cheat at cards?

395
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:43,383
- Well, you could, right?
-  Of course, I could.

396
00:31:45,595 --> 00:31:50,464
But how would I live with myself?
Who raised you?

397
00:31:51,301 --> 00:31:53,531
Well, sir,

398
00:31:53,603 --> 00:31:57,039
what does any of this have to do
with your twin brother...

399
00:31:57,107 --> 00:32:00,099
being found decapitated
at the Santa Monica Pier?

400
00:32:00,176 --> 00:32:03,236
I went to my brother
for a loan.

401
00:32:03,313 --> 00:32:05,508
Just my luck and his.

402
00:32:05,582 --> 00:32:08,415
You found him dead
of a heart attack.

403
00:32:08,485 --> 00:32:11,511
His body was still warm.

404
00:32:11,588 --> 00:32:13,818
Looking at him lifeless,

405
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:18,020
I saw myself,
my own eventual mortality.

406
00:32:18,094 --> 00:32:21,291
I saw all the things I meant
to accomplish but didn't.

407
00:32:21,364 --> 00:32:25,323
It was an opportunity to vanish,
to become someone else.

408
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:29,201
Like I said,
I'm not proud of what I did.

409
00:32:29,272 --> 00:32:31,968
And so you
refrigerated the body.

410
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:35,033
I needed time to figure out
how to pull it all off.

411
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:37,511
Impersonating my brother,
I called the bank,

412
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,844
told them I needed
a vacation week,

413
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,384
a trip to Mexico.

414
00:32:42,452 --> 00:32:45,944
Then the bank received word that
I'd been in a terrible accident.

415
00:32:46,022 --> 00:32:49,048
It gave me plenty of time
away from work.

416
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:52,219
And you posed
as an amputee...

417
00:32:52,295 --> 00:32:54,957
to allay suspicion that
you weren't your brother.

418
00:32:55,031 --> 00:32:58,194
That, and I rather enjoy
the sympathy,

419
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,668
especially from the women
in our office.

420
00:33:05,475 --> 00:33:08,410
You, uh, still
haven't explained...

421
00:33:08,478 --> 00:33:11,038
why you left your brother's body
at the pier,

422
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,674
or why you arranged to have
his head fall off.

423
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:18,084
He explained it. He put it
so eloquently when we last spoke.

424
00:33:18,154 --> 00:33:20,520
It was my
final performance.

425
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:23,889
I wanted to go out with such a shock,
such a denouement,

426
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,896
as would forever be remembered
in the annals of magic.

427
00:33:29,566 --> 00:33:31,534
That was your
last performance.

428
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:35,203
What's this for?

429
00:33:35,271 --> 00:33:38,832
Well... I still think you've got
a few tricks up your sleeve.

430
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,554
My God.

431
00:33:52,622 --> 00:33:58,026
We gave you handicapped parking.
We built you a ramp.

432
00:33:58,094 --> 00:34:00,426
Did he have access
to the vaults?

433
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,294
Well, yes. He has a key to the day gate.
Several of us do.

434
00:34:03,366 --> 00:34:06,824
- What are you looking for, Mulder?
- Any hint at all...

435
00:34:06,903 --> 00:34:11,397
as to why Maleeni here
is really impersonating his brother.

436
00:34:11,474 --> 00:34:13,874
What about this? Could he have
removed the funds electronically?

437
00:34:13,943 --> 00:34:18,642
He didn't have security clearance
for E.F.T. s... electronic fund transfers.

438
00:34:18,715 --> 00:34:22,048
Maybe he got around the security.
Can we check the withdrawal records?

439
00:34:22,118 --> 00:34:24,780
It would require your badge number
and thumbprint...

440
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,822
and probably
a federal subpoena to boot.

441
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:29,450
We're extra cautious with the E.F. T.s.
You can understand why.

442
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:32,494
There may be an easier way.

443
00:34:32,562 --> 00:34:35,122
- If I call up a transaction list
for this terminal...

444
00:34:37,634 --> 00:34:40,660
No. No, everything's in order.

445
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:48,332
Mulder, it says here something
about a robbery attempt yesterday.

446
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:52,609
Yeah, that wasn't against us, but the
armored transport service we deal with.

447
00:34:52,682 --> 00:34:55,651
No money was taken
and no suspects were caught.

448
00:34:55,718 --> 00:35:00,052
Yeah, well, Mr. Pinchbeck was
the employee who signed out the truck.

449
00:35:00,123 --> 00:35:03,024
- He knew the schedule.
- I had nothing to do with that.

450
00:35:03,092 --> 00:35:05,788
Maybe, maybe not.

451
00:35:05,862 --> 00:35:07,955
We'll hold you
till we find out.

452
00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:10,522
Make sure you don't
pull a vanishing act.

453
00:35:15,872 --> 00:35:18,136
- Hey.

454
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,611
Paul, I'm putting
Mr. Pinchbeck in six.

455
00:35:29,686 --> 00:35:31,620
Right.

456
00:35:33,122 --> 00:35:35,056
Sleep tight.

457
00:35:35,124 --> 00:35:37,456
Wait. Don't I get
a phone call, sir?

458
00:35:37,527 --> 00:35:39,461
- Sir?

459
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:54,675
- How'd it go?
- Swimmingly.

460
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,013
Abracadabra, man.

461
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,737
Oh, damn!

462
00:36:27,677 --> 00:36:29,907
Yes. Okay.

463
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:33,244
- All right. All right, thank you.
- Maleeni?

464
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:37,377
He's still in the city lockup,
where he's been since
we arrested him last night.

465
00:36:37,453 --> 00:36:40,547
Certainly doesn't
look like he did this.

466
00:36:40,623 --> 00:36:42,557
Lots of fingerprints.

467
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:45,287
Yeah, I guarantee you,
none of them match our thieves.

468
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:47,829
They're too clever
to leave clues,

469
00:36:47,897 --> 00:36:49,956
except for the ones
they want us to find.

470
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:53,400
- Excuse me. May I show you something?
- Hmm.

471
00:36:53,469 --> 00:36:56,529
We thought the security-camera footage
might show the robbers.

472
00:36:56,606 --> 00:36:59,268
-  Does it?
- No. They all mysteriously...

473
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,936
went blank from about
3:00 a.m. to 3:20,

474
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:05,947
- But that's not what
we wanted you to see.
- This is from two days ago.

475
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:13,110
Cissy Alvarez,
convicted bank robber.

476
00:37:13,187 --> 00:37:16,645
- You recognize this man?
- Yeah. Who is he to you?

477
00:37:16,724 --> 00:37:20,717
-  I know those tattoos.

478
00:37:20,795 --> 00:37:22,786
That's the man who
tried to rob my truck.

479
00:37:22,863 --> 00:37:25,991
Aah! What the hell, man?
What did I do?

480
00:37:26,067 --> 00:37:29,264
Yo, F.B.I., what's up?
What's up with this, man?

481
00:37:29,337 --> 00:37:31,805
You can't just come bustin'in here!
I got civil rights!

482
00:37:31,872 --> 00:37:34,602
I'm gonna call my lawyer,
and then we're gonna see what's what.

483
00:37:34,675 --> 00:37:38,441
- There's nothing back there.
- This is harassment, man.
This is harassment!

484
00:37:38,512 --> 00:37:40,639
Yo, what are they
lookin' for?

485
00:37:40,715 --> 00:37:42,842
- Come on! Somebody talk to me!
-  Shut up!

486
00:37:42,917 --> 00:37:45,647
No, you shut up!
Yo, man, this ain't right.

487
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,847
Why you got the cuffs
on so tight?

488
00:37:47,922 --> 00:37:51,414
Yo, will you please tell me
what he's lookin'for?

489
00:37:55,863 --> 00:37:58,661
Oh!

490
00:37:58,733 --> 00:38:03,830
- What?
- Well. Saving up for a rainy day?

491
00:38:06,407 --> 00:38:09,604
- Oh, no, no, no! We got framed!
This is a frame-up!
-  Let's go.

492
00:38:09,677 --> 00:38:12,942
- It was the magician!
- The magician? Maleeni?

493
00:38:13,014 --> 00:38:17,713
No, not the dead one, man! That little
cabron LaBonge! LaBonge set me up!

494
00:38:17,785 --> 00:38:20,549
- Listen to me! Listen to me!
- Billy LaBonge.

495
00:38:20,621 --> 00:38:25,115
And the Amazing Maleeni. That's a
double bill I wouldn't want to miss.

496
00:38:27,595 --> 00:38:29,995
Pinchbeck.
You made your bail.

497
00:38:35,636 --> 00:38:37,570
You, too, LaBonge.

498
00:38:41,409 --> 00:38:43,877
-  Okay.

499
00:38:43,944 --> 00:38:47,971
- I think releasing these two
may be a bit premature.
-  Give us a minute.

500
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:54,383
Good morning, gentlemen.
Did you sleep well?

501
00:38:54,455 --> 00:38:57,151
Agent Mulder.
Agent Scully.

502
00:38:57,224 --> 00:39:02,025
- Bravo. Really.
- What do you mean?

503
00:39:02,096 --> 00:39:06,499
Last night the Cradock Marine Bank
was robbed of $1.8 million.

504
00:39:06,567 --> 00:39:08,694
This morning that
entire amount was found...

505
00:39:08,769 --> 00:39:11,033
in the possession
of Mr. Cissy Alvarez.

506
00:39:11,105 --> 00:39:14,939
Wow. I told you he was bad news.
Bravo to you.

507
00:39:15,009 --> 00:39:17,534
- It was expeditious police work.
-  Well, thank you.

508
00:39:17,611 --> 00:39:21,672
It was, wasn't it? It's only that
Alvarez was so obviously guilty...

509
00:39:21,749 --> 00:39:23,842
a convicted bank robber
caught red-handed,

510
00:39:23,918 --> 00:39:26,580
witnessed trying to rob an armored car
just two days earlier?

511
00:39:26,654 --> 00:39:28,918
- He'll need a good lawyer.
- Yeah.

512
00:39:28,989 --> 00:39:31,719
- Yeah, he's up a creek,
just like you two want him.
- Yeah.

513
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:34,556
I don't quite see where
you're headed with this.

514
00:39:34,628 --> 00:39:38,223
I have no evidence,
but I have a theory, Mr. Maleeni,

515
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:41,393
and, uh, I'll tell you
how it goes.

516
00:39:41,469 --> 00:39:44,336
I think that your twin brother Albert
died of a heart attack,

517
00:39:44,405 --> 00:39:47,431
at which point, you and your
young protegee saw a golden opportunity.

518
00:39:47,508 --> 00:39:50,272
My protegee?
I hate this guy's guts.

519
00:39:50,344 --> 00:39:53,336
That's what you
wanted us to think.

520
00:39:53,414 --> 00:39:57,248
You wanted revenge against the man who
made your life in prison a living hell.

521
00:39:57,318 --> 00:40:00,481
I did time with you
about eight years ago.

522
00:40:00,554 --> 00:40:05,321
Alvarez. You and he were on
the same cell block eight years ago.

523
00:40:05,392 --> 00:40:09,226
It was a setup from the start.
You played poker with him,
and you made sure that you lost big.

524
00:40:09,296 --> 00:40:13,232
Which gave LaBonge an in with Alvarez
once everybody thought you were dead.

525
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:17,100
LaBonge planted Alvarez's marker in
Maleeni's van and made sure we found it.

526
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:19,662
And then you used Alvarez's greed
in order to ensnare him,

527
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:24,404
and then orchestrated the attempted
bank robbery in order to implicate him.

528
00:40:24,478 --> 00:40:27,174
Yeah, that was you in the armored car
disguised as Alvarez.

529
00:40:27,248 --> 00:40:30,979
Somehow Mr. Pinchbeck got ahold of
the guard's gun and switched the clip.

530
00:40:31,051 --> 00:40:33,576
- Hold it!
- Guard didn't know it,
but he was firing blanks.

531
00:40:33,654 --> 00:40:36,646
And then last night,
the two of you robbed the bank...

532
00:40:36,724 --> 00:40:39,284
and planted the money
at Alvarez's place.

533
00:40:42,062 --> 00:40:44,326
Don't you think we have
pretty good alibis?

534
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:47,265
You have great alibis.
You have the best alibis in the world,

535
00:40:47,334 --> 00:40:50,303
which is why I think you two
got arrested in the first place.

536
00:40:50,371 --> 00:40:54,000
With your expertise in sleight of hand,
pickpocketing and escapology,

537
00:40:54,074 --> 00:40:58,340
I think you were both able to get out
of here by pilfering a guard's key.

538
00:40:58,412 --> 00:41:00,710
You could have escaped,
stolen the money, framed Alvarez...

539
00:41:00,781 --> 00:41:02,806
and been back here
in time for breakfast.

540
00:41:02,883 --> 00:41:05,181
Scrambled eggs and sausage.

541
00:41:05,252 --> 00:41:08,312
That would be the world's
greatest trick, wouldn't it?

542
00:41:08,389 --> 00:41:12,018
One that would be forever remembered
in the annals of magic.

543
00:41:15,095 --> 00:41:18,895
- What happens to us?
-  To you?

544
00:41:18,966 --> 00:41:23,164
You go free,
provided the magic is over.

545
00:41:25,172 --> 00:41:28,141
The great ones always know
when to leave the stage.

546
00:41:32,479 --> 00:41:35,107
Billy, let's get
the hell outta here.

547
00:41:43,157 --> 00:41:47,651
- They are the world's greatest.
- We saw through their magic.

548
00:41:47,728 --> 00:41:49,662
Ah, there's more.

549
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:56,235
Behold.

550
00:41:56,303 --> 00:41:59,329
- The Amazing Maleeni's wallet.
- You picked his pocket?

551
00:41:59,406 --> 00:42:02,273
No, I pilfered it from the evidence room
to prevent them from completing...

552
00:42:02,343 --> 00:42:04,607
their final act
of prestidigitation.

553
00:42:04,678 --> 00:42:06,737
- What are you talking about?
- I began to wonder,

554
00:42:06,814 --> 00:42:08,907
why did they need
so elaborate a setup?

555
00:42:08,983 --> 00:42:12,612
Why so high profile?
Why draw the attention
of the F.B.I. in the first place?

556
00:42:12,686 --> 00:42:15,211
We were the last piece
of the puzzle.

557
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:17,553
Yes. Framing Alvarez was
just another misdirection.

558
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:21,493
This trick was about E.F.T. s,
electronic fund transfers at the bank.

559
00:42:21,562 --> 00:42:24,861
Maleeni, Pinchbeck, he didn't have
security clearance for them,

560
00:42:24,932 --> 00:42:28,095
so he needed a little federal law
enforcement intervention...

561
00:42:28,168 --> 00:42:30,363
specifically,
my badge number...

562
00:42:31,939 --> 00:42:34,908
and my thumbprint.

563
00:42:34,975 --> 00:42:38,934
With those two items
they could pull off an E.F.T.
and steal enough electronically...

564
00:42:39,013 --> 00:42:42,039
as to make that 1.8 million
look like cigar-lighting money.

565
00:42:44,151 --> 00:42:46,585
But they can't do it
without this.

566
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:51,986
Pick a card, Scully.
Any card.

567
00:42:56,096 --> 00:42:59,224
You know, Mulder, there's still
one thing that you haven't explained.

568
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,234
What's that?

569
00:43:01,302 --> 00:43:04,635
How the Amazing Maleeni was able
to turn his head completely around.

570
00:43:04,705 --> 00:43:07,071
- I don't know that.
- I do.

571
00:43:07,141 --> 00:43:09,666
I'll show you.
Observe.

572
00:43:26,694 --> 00:43:29,788
Gee! Very nice.
How'd you do that?

573
00:43:31,832 --> 00:43:34,926
Well... magic.

574
00:43:35,002 --> 00:43:37,368
No, seriously, Scully.
How'd you do it?

575
00:43:38,906 --> 00:43:41,272
You know,
it's not the same thing.

576
00:43:41,342 --> 00:43:46,405
Uh, it's different with the head.
Come on, now. Look at this.
