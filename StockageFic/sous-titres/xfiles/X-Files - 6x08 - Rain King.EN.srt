Mulder, we're going home.
The rain stopped this afternoon.

326
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,627
Daryl Mootz is being
sued by about 50 people.

327
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:28,257
There's no case,
and you told Sheila yourself
that she wasn't controlling the weather.

328
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,427
She's not.
Neither is Daryl.

329
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:35,769
Check this out. On the same day
that it rained rose petals--

330
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,642
""Irene Hardt, beloved wife
and devoted mother...

331
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:43,738
""passed away yesterday afternoon--
[ Mumbling ]

332
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,147
She's survived by one son,
Holman Hardt.''

333
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:50,587
- So now you're saying that--
- Holman Hardt is
manufacturing the weather.

334
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,749
Did you see how relieved he was when
he learned that Daryl was drunk?

335
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,020
I've been doing
some checking.

336
00:24:56,127 --> 00:25:00,826
Holman Hardt has been hospitalized
five times with nervous exhaustion,

337
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,959
each time coinciding with
a major meteorological event.

338
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,265
Mulder, it is still
a huge leap...

339
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,568
to say that he's
manufacturing the weather.

340
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,804
Most people will admit that the weather
plays a significant role in the way
they feel, right?

341
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,142
- There's even that disorder--
- ""SAD.''

342
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,272
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Seasonal affective disorder.

343
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,840
Well, who's to say that it doesn't work
the other way around--

344
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,751
that the way someone feels
can affect the weather,

345
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,881
that the weather is somehow an
expression of Holman Hardt's feelings.

346
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,926
Or-Or-Or better still, the feelings
that he's not expressing?

347
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:33,859
I've tried to say this
a thousand times,

348
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,394
tried to express the...

349
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:43,601
fire that burns inside this...
humble exterior.

350
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:49,974

Sh-Sheila, hi.
Y-Yeah, um--

355
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,328
I was just
thinking about you.

356
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,807
- I'm looking forward to
the reunion tomorrow night.
- Me too.

357
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:21,869
You sound in a good mood. Well, I am,
Holman, and it's all because of you.

358
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,877
I wanted to let you know
that I've been thinking...

359
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,146
about what you said
about Daryl yesterday,

360
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:31,848
- and I realized that you were right.
- I was?

361
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:36,360
Yes, you were, and I am so over him.
""Daryl who?'' That's what I say.

362
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,363
I realized that I've been chasing
the wrong kind of guy.

363
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,025
I need someone
who I can talk to.

364
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,830
I need someone
who I can feel safe with.

365
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:48,202
I can't tell you
what that means to me.

366
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,741
Holman, I want
to ask you something,

367
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,835
and I hope that we can keep it
our secret for the time being.

368
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,346
Of course, Sheila,

369

<i>Hey, Holman.</i>

- I've come to say good-bye, Holman.

- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

375
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,848
But I want you to get some help
before you kill somebody.

00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,941
- Help? What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about.

You're not just <i>a</i> weatherman.
You're <i>the</i> weatherman.

You're the person who's
been affecting the weather.

379
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,786
Agent Mulder, if I could
control the weather,

380
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,885
don't you think I
would make it rain?

381
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,260
- That I would end this drought?
- I don't think it works that way.

382
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,061
I don't think you do it on purpose. I
just think you bottle up your emotions--

383
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,295
anger, grief
or love or whatever--

384
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:54,338
and then as a response, it rains
or hails or there's a flying cow.

385
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,908
That poor animal.

386
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,706
And whatever it is,
you got to let it out.

387
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,847
I can't.

388
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,042
Yeah, you can.

told her the way you feel.
