1
00:00:25,172 --> 00:00:27,640
Woman: What's she doing
there by herself?

2
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:38,009
Man:
Teena?

3
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:39,347
Honey?

4
00:00:41,288 --> 00:00:42,277
You're freezing.

5
00:00:42,356 --> 00:00:43,482
Where's yourjacket?

6
00:00:43,557 --> 00:00:45,320
Where's your daddy?

7
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:46,450
In theyard.

8
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:49,427
He told me he needed
some time to himself.

9
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:51,760
I'd say his time's up.

10
00:00:51,832 --> 00:00:52,958
Come on, honey.

11
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:55,660
I'm sure he wouldn't
wantyou to catch cold.

12
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,537
joel?

13
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,741
Hey,Joel,

14
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:08,645
the swing set's supposed to be
foryour daughter, not foryou.

15
00:01:08,715 --> 00:01:11,081
( screams )

16
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:13,176
I'll call 91 1 .

17
00:01:21,261 --> 00:01:22,751
Daddy?

18
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:20,580
Death by hypovolemia

19
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:23,884
75% blood loss.

20
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:26,050
That's over four liters
ofblood.

21
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:29,994
You could say
the man was running on empty.

22
00:02:30,063 --> 00:02:32,827
The man's daughter,
eightyears old

23
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:36,733
was away from his side
no more than ten minutes.

24
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:38,464
She doesn't remember anything.

25
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:40,165
No trace evidence
at the scene.

26
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,767
Any evidence would have been
washed away byyesterday's rain.

27
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:45,539
There were two small
puncture wounds

28
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:47,079
in thejugular.

29
00:02:47,147 --> 00:02:48,580
Areyou at all familiar

30
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:50,878
with the phenomenon
ofcattle mutilations?

31
00:02:50,984 --> 00:02:52,451
Hmm?

32
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:54,316
Since 1 967, over 34 states

33
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:58,084
have reported unsolved cases
ofcattle mutilations.

34
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:00,388
( projectorhumming )

35
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,928
The trace evidence
is remarkably similar.

36
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:06,227
Incision marks
ofsurgical precision.

37
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:10,030
The area around the mouth,
and, often, the sexual organs

38
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:11,331
has been removed.

39
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:13,338
There's a substantial degree
ofblood loss

40
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:14,964
without a trace
ofblood.

41
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,338
How can that be?

42
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:17,535
Exsanguination.

43
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:19,943
Ifyou stick a needle
in thejugular

44
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:21,344
ofany living creature

45
00:03:21,414 --> 00:03:23,507
the heart itselfacts as a pump.

46
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:25,881
These animals
had theirjugulars punctured

47
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:29,922
the same as that man,
only this is the first time

48
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:31,854
i've seen it on a human being.

49
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:33,392
But there was no struggle.

50
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:36,485
How can a manjust sit through
a bloodletting?

51
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:38,724
The M.E. found
traces ofdigitalis--

52
00:03:38,798 --> 00:03:42,131
a South American plant that can
be used as a paralytic drug.

53
00:03:42,202 --> 00:03:44,727
These X Files indicate this
is a U.F.O.-related phenomena.

54
00:03:44,804 --> 00:03:46,237
Often, there are sightings

55
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:49,207
in the sky near the incident,
surface burns...

56
00:03:49,276 --> 00:03:51,107
Witnesses often report
time loss.

57
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:52,906
We've seen this
in abduction cases.

58
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:55,777
That might explain why
she can't remember anything.

59
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:59,285
Mulder, whywould alien beings
travel light-years to earth

60
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:01,354
in order to play doctor
on cattle?

61
00:04:01,454 --> 00:04:06,084
For the same reason
we cut up frogs and monkeys.

62
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,820
Besides...

63
00:04:07,894 --> 00:04:10,863
they seem to have stepped up
their interest.

64
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:30,480
Her mother passed away from
ovarian cancer twoyears ago.

65
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:32,814
There's no other family.

66
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,855
We'll keep Teena here until we can
place herwith a foster family.

67
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,320
Has she spoken about it?

68
00:04:40,393 --> 00:04:41,519
No, not a word.

69
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:42,721
Any nightmares?

70
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:46,027
No. At least,
not that I know of.

71
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:53,472
Can we talk to her now?

72
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,802
Yes.

73
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:57,572
Teena?

74
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:01,604
These are the people
we talked about.

75
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:04,172
This is Miss Scully
and Mr. Mulder.

76
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:07,151
Doyou think
you can talk to them?

77
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,711
Okay.

78
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:15,157
Hi.

79
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:17,857
I knowyou must
be feeling

80
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:19,296
very sad right now

81
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:20,924
and scared

82
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:24,767
but we want to find out
what happened

83
00:05:24,838 --> 00:05:26,772
so we can help stop

84
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,775
whoever hurt
your daddy, okay?

85
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:32,778
Did you ever see
any strangers

86
00:05:32,846 --> 00:05:35,974
with your daddy at home?

87
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:41,712
Did you ever see anyone
yell atyour daddy

88
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:43,584
oryour daddyyell at them?

89
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:45,625
No.

90
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:48,661
Can you think ofanyone
who might want

91
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:49,854
to hurtyour daddy?

92
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:51,328
No.

93
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:53,332
That's a nice bunny, Teena.

94
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:58,333
Can we talk about
what happened that day?

95
00:05:58,405 --> 00:06:02,273
About what happened
in the backyard?

96
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:07,279
You remember any strange sounds
or lights

97
00:06:07,347 --> 00:06:09,042
or anything like that?

98
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:14,951
There was red lightning.

99
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:16,750
Can you
tell me more

100
00:06:16,823 --> 00:06:18,984
about the red lightning?

101
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:21,550
I can't remember.

102
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:24,188
It all went dark.

103
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:28,257
Haveyou ever seen
anything like that before?

104
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:30,659
You have?

105
00:06:30,737 --> 00:06:31,999
When?

106
00:06:32,072 --> 00:06:33,937
The men from the clouds.

107
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:36,305
Theywere after my dad.

108
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:40,677
( telephonerings )

109
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:43,314
Scully.

110
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:46,910
Whywere these men
afteryour dad?

111
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,512
Theywanted to exsanguinate him.

112
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,420
Mulder.

113
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:54,084
What?

114
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:02,357
There's been another one.

115
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:18,148
It's like looking
at a mirror image.

116
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:23,214
The victim, Reardon,
was married with one daughter.

117
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:24,950
Cause ofdeath: hypovolemia.

118
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:27,857
Mulder, this is uncanny.

119
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:31,294
They also found traces
ofthe poison, digitalis.

120
00:07:31,364 --> 00:07:32,956
Puncture wound?

121
00:07:33,032 --> 00:07:35,296
Uh... yes.

122
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:37,632
On thejugular.

123
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:41,037
The time ofdeath was estimated
at 2:30 p.m.

124
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:43,473
Same day,
only three hours earlier

125
00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:44,703
than the Simmons murder.

126
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:46,268
That's Pacific Standard Time.

127
00:07:46,346 --> 00:07:49,406
That makes it
the exact same moment.

128
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:52,747
It appears as ifwe
have two serial killers

129
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:54,319
working in tandem.

130
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,718
No, serial killers
rarelywork in pairs

131
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,121
and when they do

132
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:00,125
they kill together,
not separately.

133
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:01,353
Mulder, nothing beyond

134
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:03,861
your leading questions
to Teena Simmons

135
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,023
substantiates
a U.F.O. mutilation theory.

136
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:08,761
Was Reardon's daughter
here when he was murdered?

137
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:11,269
Uh... yes.

138
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:15,433
The police report states
that she remembers nothing.

139
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:19,672
She's with her mother
and family in Sacramento.

140
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:21,805
When will they be back?

141
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:23,678
Tomorrow.

142
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,514
Even money, she'll
remember red lightning.

143
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:48,027
( footsteps approaching )

144
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:04,481
( screaming )

145
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:11,282
Teena?

146
00:10:11,357 --> 00:10:14,190
Teena?

147
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:18,654
Teena?

148
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:23,801
Teena!

149
00:10:35,448 --> 00:10:37,348
She was kidnapped from
the social services home

150
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:39,612
around 1 1 :00 p.m.
Iast night.

151
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:40,744
Looks like someone
was afraid

152
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,651
she might remember too much.

153
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:44,917
Someone
or something, Scully.

154
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:46,458
Connecticut state troopers

155
00:10:46,526 --> 00:10:49,017
set up roadblocks
within a halfan hour.

156
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:50,425
Nothing.

157
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,363
Maybe theyweren't looking
in the right direction.

158
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:56,527
I told them to contact us
in case they find her.

159
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,443
Teena?

160
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:07,706
No.

161
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:10,676
What's your name?

162
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,684
Cindy Reardon.

163
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:15,277
Doyou live here, Cindy?

164
00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:17,550
Ever since I was born,
eightyears ago.

165
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:26,998
Help!

166
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:30,058
( whimpers )

167
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:32,137
(yelling )

168
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:35,435
Whew!

169
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:39,000
This is the ceremonial signing
ofthe bill

170
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:40,773
which is now known as...

171
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:43,941
and forever forward
from this point on, known as...

172
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:45,609
Cindy really is

173
00:11:45,685 --> 00:11:48,210
a beautiful little girl,
Mrs. Reardon.

174
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:50,448
Doug and I wanted
to spoil her.

175
00:11:50,523 --> 00:11:52,252
We wanted to protect her

176
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:54,953
from everything horrible
in the world.

177
00:11:59,532 --> 00:12:01,397
She was Daddy's
little girl.

178
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:03,059
Is she an only child?

179
00:12:05,838 --> 00:12:08,807
May I ask... was Cindy adopted?

180
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,604
No.

181
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:13,543
I gave birth to her
at San Rafael General.

182
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:15,171
So I assumeyou have

183
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:17,739
all the proper
documentation--

184
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:19,342
birth certificate...

185
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:20,784
Ofcourse I do.

186
00:12:20,853 --> 00:12:24,118
Was she the only child
delivered at that birth?

187
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,750
What the hell kind
ofquestion is that?

188
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:28,987
Look, I have told the police

189
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:30,494
everything I know.

190
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:34,657
Mrs. Reardon, haveyou ever
seen this man before?

191
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:39,195
Is this
your suspect?

192
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:40,637
No.

193
00:12:40,706 --> 00:12:42,697
Did he do something
to Cindy?

194
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:44,208
No, he...

195
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:45,710
No, Mrs. Reardon.

196
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:47,712
This is notyour daughter.

197
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,476
That girl's name
is Teena Simmons.

198
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,075
She lives in Greenwich,
Connecticut.

199
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:54,915
That man-- her father--

200
00:12:54,987 --> 00:12:58,252
was killed in the same
manner as your husband.

201
00:12:58,324 --> 00:13:01,816
Cindy is my daughter.

202
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:05,796
I can showyou videos
ofher birth.

203
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:09,767
We tried for sixyears
to become pregnant.

204
00:13:09,836 --> 00:13:11,804
In vitro fertilization?

205
00:13:14,474 --> 00:13:15,805
At which clinic?

206
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:20,039
The Luther Stapes Center
down in San Francisco.

207
00:13:20,113 --> 00:13:21,637
Mulder:
Thanks.

208
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:24,615
Scully: Doyoustillbelieve
this is U.F. O.-related?

209
00:13:24,684 --> 00:13:27,244
Cindy Reardon didn't see
red lightning.

210
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,982
The only thing similar
about these girls

211
00:13:30,056 --> 00:13:32,286
does seem to be
their appearance.

212
00:13:32,358 --> 00:13:34,724
There is
the random possibility

213
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:37,888
that two people can have
an unrelated likeness.

214
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:41,433
Who bothjust happen to see
their fathers exsanguinated.

215
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:44,493
I'd like to get the odds on that
in Vegas.

216
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:55,343
The girls are
the one and only link

217
00:13:55,414 --> 00:13:57,382
between identical murders.

218
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,441
And one girl wasjust abducted.

219
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,043
Kidnapped.

220
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,054
* Po-ta-to, po-tah-to... *

221
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:05,420
Where areyou going?

222
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:08,551
Ifthe murders were committed
by the same person

223
00:14:08,628 --> 00:14:12,064
part ofthe pattern involves
kidnapping the daughter.

224
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:14,224
You'd expect
the pattern to continue.

225
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,028
I'm going to watch the girl.

226
00:14:16,102 --> 00:14:17,729
You check out the clinic.

227
00:14:17,803 --> 00:14:20,169
See ifthe Simmons
were enrolled.

228
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:22,605
I'll call
the San Francisco bureau

229
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:24,142
and get someone

230
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,575
to relieveyou.

231
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:26,805
Okay.

232
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:29,379
Dr. Katz:
During vitro fertilization

233
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:31,882
we canimplementfertilization
andimplantation

234
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:33,885
ofthe embryo
in the uterus.

235
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:37,684
Could a patient believe
she was receiving her own egg

236
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:41,386
but actually receive another
without her knowledge?

237
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,052
Not here.

238
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:45,062
We have very strict
controls.

239
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:47,361
Areyou aware ofever
having patients

240
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:49,434
named Claudia
andJoel Simmons?

241
00:14:49,502 --> 00:14:51,163
That's confidential.
It's our policy.

242
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:53,000
Both the Simmons are dead

243
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:55,540
and their daughter
has been kidnapped.

244
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:58,771
I'd say any information you have
that could help

245
00:14:58,844 --> 00:15:01,005
would overrideyour policy.

246
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:05,313
You had copies
oftheir records transferred

247
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:08,785
to Greenwich, Connecticut
in 1 991 .

248
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:16,191
They came here nineyears ago

249
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:19,662
under the supervision
ofa Dr. Sally Kendrick?

250
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:24,068
Is there a problem?

251
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:29,831
Dr. Kendrickwas nothing
but a problem.

252
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,109
Hello, and welcome

253
00:15:32,178 --> 00:15:35,670
to the Luther Stapes Center
for reproductive medicine.

254
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:37,340
I'm Dr. Sally Kendrick

255
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,714
a specialist
in the exciting field

256
00:15:39,785 --> 00:15:41,844
ofin vitro fertilization...

257
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:44,287
She was a resident here in 1 985.

258
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:45,915
Brilliant.

259
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:50,190
First in her class at Yale Med
where she got her M.D.

260
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:53,629
after completing
her doctorate in biogenetics.

261
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:56,031
Oh, we were thrilled to get her.

262
00:15:56,102 --> 00:15:58,434
And nowyou don't sound
so thrilled.

263
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:01,996
We have reason to believe
that Dr. Kendrick

264
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:04,941
was tampering
with genetic material

265
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:08,606
offertilized ova in the lab
prior to implant--

266
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:10,672
experimenting
with eugenics.

267
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,980
Did you report this
to the A.M.A.?

268
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:14,485
Ofcourse.

269
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:16,077
I fired her

270
00:16:16,155 --> 00:16:19,556
and requested an investigation
from the health department.

271
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,990
And what happened?

272
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,052
The A.M.A. censured her.

273
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:26,927
My request for
an investigation was denied.

274
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:28,466
...atLutherStapes...

275
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:32,493
Dr. Kendrick... disappeared.

276
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:37,440
Weknowthepain ofinfertility,
andweare readytohelp.

277
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,137
In the next halfhour

278
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:42,009
I'll guideyou
through our l.V.F. program...

279
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:44,549
Scully: Kendrick supervised
the Reardons'

280
00:16:44,617 --> 00:16:46,608
and Simmons' l.V.F. program.

281
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:49,211
It seems she experimented
at the clinic.

282
00:16:49,288 --> 00:16:53,019
Mulder: And maybe now she's
trying to erase the results?

283
00:16:53,092 --> 00:16:56,220
I wish that we could guarantee
everyone success

284
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:58,388
but with
our scientific advances

285
00:16:58,497 --> 00:17:00,658
a little luck,
and a lot ofhope

286
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:02,324
miracles can happen.

287
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:04,403
Well, she must have
had an accomplice

288
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:06,937
in order to have done
both murders.

289
00:17:07,006 --> 00:17:10,999
Soyou think this is a vendetta
that she and a colleague have

290
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:12,806
against
the Stapes Center?

291
00:17:12,878 --> 00:17:15,073
Haveyou abandoned
your U.F.O. connection?

292
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:16,705
( phonerings )

293
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:18,443
Hello?

294
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:20,951
Hello?

295
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:23,621
just a couple clicks.

296
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:25,657
Must be
the wrong number.

297
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:27,386
I'll tell you what...

298
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,087
I'm going to sleep on it

299
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:32,153
and we'll talk about it
in the morning.

300
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:35,223
Mulder, you're rushing me
out ofthe room.

301
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:36,801
No, I'm not.

302
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:38,700
Doyou have a girl

303
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:39,931
coming over?

304
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:41,336
What's a girl?

305
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:43,432
I got a movie
to watch on TV.

306
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:44,908
Sleep tight.

307
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:46,145
Seeyou in the morning.

308
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:03,725
Areyou certain
she hasn't followed you?

309
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:05,730
What areyou doing here?

310
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:10,735
Well, I thought we might
take in a Warriors game.

311
00:18:10,803 --> 00:18:16,332
No. Actually, I was
just in the neighborhood

312
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:18,104
and, uh...

313
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:22,111
wondered if
I had ever told you

314
00:18:22,181 --> 00:18:25,480
about the Litchfield
experiments.

315
00:18:25,551 --> 00:18:28,850
Hmm... no, you haven't.

316
00:18:28,954 --> 00:18:32,390
Well, it was a most...

317
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,325
interesting project.

318
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:37,862
Highest level
ofclassification.

319
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,899
All records have since
been destroyed.

320
00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:43,025
And those who knew ofit

321
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:45,696
will deny knowledge
ofits existence.

322
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:47,398
In the early '50s

323
00:18:47,473 --> 00:18:49,941
during the height
ofthe Cold War

324
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:52,307
we got wind
that the Russians

325
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:55,006
were fooling around
with eugenics--

326
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,981
rather primitively,
I might add--

327
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,847
trying to crossbreed

328
00:18:59,952 --> 00:19:02,546
their top scientists,
athletes--

329
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:04,282
you name it--

330
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,858
to come up with
the superior soldier.

331
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,392
Naturally, wejumped

332
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:10,725
on thebandwagon.

333
00:19:10,796 --> 00:19:13,321
Mulder:
the Litchfieldexperiment.

334
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:17,460
Deep Throat: A group of
geneticallycontrolledchildren

335
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:21,836
who were raisedandmonitored
ona compoundin Litchfield.

336
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:24,273
Theboys were called 'Adam"

337
00:19:24,343 --> 00:19:26,903
andthegirls
were called "Eve. "

338
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:28,913
There'sa woman

00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:30,471

thatyoucangetin.

342
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:38,085
Agents Mulder and Scully here
to see Eve 6.

343
00:19:38,157 --> 00:19:40,523
Deposityour firearms.

344
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:42,220
Sign for these.

345
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:43,921
What are those?

346
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:45,463
Panic buttons.

347
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:48,295
Can't letyou inside
without one.

348
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,903
Thankyou.

349
00:20:38,617 --> 00:20:39,777
Why the fashlight?

350
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:42,979
She screams and screams
ifwe turn the overheads on.

351
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:45,852
No one's ever got
a real good look at her.

352
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:52,489
We'll be right outside.

353
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:03,503
Mulder:
Hello?

354
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:17,455
So I guess you found
whatyou're looking for.

355
00:21:25,264 --> 00:21:28,028
One ofus, at least.

356
00:21:30,869 --> 00:21:32,996
Sally Kendrick.

357
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:43,308
Unlock the chains,
and then we'll talk.

358
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:45,441
They're probably there
for a good reason.

359
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:47,985
No. A bad reason.

360
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:52,080
I paid too much attention
to a guard.

361
00:21:52,191 --> 00:21:54,159
I bit into his eyeball.

362
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:59,964
I meant it
as a sign ofaffection.

363
00:22:00,032 --> 00:22:03,058
( laughs )

364
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:07,435
Areyou here to give me
an l.Q test, by any chance?

365
00:22:07,506 --> 00:22:09,770
I think I can top 265.

366
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:11,935
We're very bright,
we Eves.

367
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:14,172
It runs
in the family.

368
00:22:14,246 --> 00:22:17,477
Where are the others,
the Adams and the Eves?

369
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:20,575
We're prone to suicide.

370
00:22:20,686 --> 00:22:23,052
All that's left is me...

371
00:22:23,122 --> 00:22:24,680
and Eve 7.

372
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,758
She escaped early on.

373
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:28,622
And Eve 8.

374
00:22:28,694 --> 00:22:30,628
She escaped ten years later.

375
00:22:30,696 --> 00:22:33,688
Areyou Sally Kendrick?

376
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:36,394
That's not my name, but...

377
00:22:36,468 --> 00:22:39,596
she is me, and I am her, and...

378
00:22:39,672 --> 00:22:41,697
we are all together.

379
00:22:41,774 --> 00:22:43,435
Scully:
Did you work

380
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:47,001
for the Luther Stapes Center for
reproductive medicine in 1 985?

381
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:51,175
In 1 985, I had been tied up
like this for twoyears

382
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,945
and forwhat reason?

383
00:22:53,052 --> 00:22:54,986
No reason. I did nothing.

384
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:56,521
I'm just me.

385
00:22:56,622 --> 00:22:58,954
They made me...

386
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:02,050
but did they suffer?

387
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:04,129
No. No, I suffer.

388
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:05,891
I suffer!

389
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:08,398
They keep me alive

390
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:11,197
for the Litchfield project.

391
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,670
They come in and they test me.

392
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:16,867
They poke me
to see what went wrong.

393
00:23:16,942 --> 00:23:21,140
Sally knows what went wrong.

394
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:26,173
You and you--

395
00:23:26,285 --> 00:23:28,276
you have 46 chromosomes.

396
00:23:28,387 --> 00:23:32,289
The Adams, me, the Eves--
we have 56.

397
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:34,917
We have extra chromosomes.

398
00:23:34,993 --> 00:23:37,860
Number four, five,
1 2, 1 6, and 22.

399
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:43,027
This replication ofchromosomes
also produces additional genes.

400
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:46,799
Heightened strength,
heightened intelligence...

401
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:49,033
Heightened psychosis.

402
00:23:49,108 --> 00:23:51,872
Saved the best for last.

403
00:23:55,114 --> 00:23:57,810
You don't believe me.

404
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,977
I have proof.

405
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:02,212
Look on mywall.

406
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:05,085
My family album.

407
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:12,024
Scully:
My God. It's the girls.

408
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:13,928
Eve 6: We were close.

409
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:17,765
We were very close.

410
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:20,031
Sally Kendrick
was using the clinic

411
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:22,596
to carry on
the Litchfield experiment.

412
00:24:22,674 --> 00:24:26,201
She was cloning herself.

413
00:24:29,448 --> 00:24:32,212
Cindy:
" Now I lay me down to sleep

414
00:24:32,284 --> 00:24:34,343
"I pray the Lord my soul to keep

415
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:37,183
"ifl should die before I wake

416
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:40,053
I pray the Lord
my soul to take."

417
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:43,060
God bless
Grandma and Grampa Stenner

418
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:44,925
Irma and lrmapop

419
00:24:44,997 --> 00:24:46,726
and God bless Mom

420
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,700
and please take care of Daddy
up in heaven.

421
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:53,568
You're such a special
little girl, Cindy.

422
00:25:08,754 --> 00:25:11,018
Good night, honey.

423
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:20,692
If Eve 6 is right

424
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:24,429
then there are
two other Eves out there.

425
00:25:24,503 --> 00:25:28,064
That could account for
the two identical murders

426
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,802
occurring at exactly
the same time.

427
00:25:30,876 --> 00:25:33,674
Sally Kendrick does have
an accomplice. Herself.

428
00:25:33,745 --> 00:25:36,839
Until I heard that,
I suspected the girls.

429
00:25:36,915 --> 00:25:39,406
No, no. It seems
the two remaining Eves

430
00:25:39,518 --> 00:25:41,611
are doing awaywith the parents

431
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,923
in order to keep Teena and Cindy
in the family.

432
00:26:17,956 --> 00:26:21,983
Scully: Doyou suppose the girls
have any idea ofwhat they are?

433
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,655
I hope not.

434
00:26:33,672 --> 00:26:34,866
Mulder, let's go!

435
00:26:34,973 --> 00:26:37,669
I'll take the back.

436
00:26:39,645 --> 00:26:41,772
( knocking )

437
00:26:41,847 --> 00:26:43,439
There's someone upstairs.

438
00:26:43,515 --> 00:26:44,743
Wait outside.

439
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:12,098
F.B.I.!

440
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:15,236
I'm armed!

441
00:27:15,347 --> 00:27:16,609
Which one areyou?

442
00:27:16,682 --> 00:27:18,411
Eve 7 or Eve 8?

443
00:27:18,483 --> 00:27:20,747
Drop it.

444
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:22,753
You know I'm capable.

445
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,318
Slow. Very slow.

446
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:52,710
The suspect's name
is Sally Kendrick

447
00:27:52,784 --> 00:27:55,048
early 40s, 5' 8",
1 35 pounds.

448
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,350
Now, she may have
an accomplice

449
00:27:57,422 --> 00:27:58,946
similar in appearance.

450
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:02,050
Kendrick is driving
a light blue '93 Corolla.

451
00:28:02,127 --> 00:28:04,857
She has exceptional strength
for her size.

452
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,831
Soyou must consider her
armed and dangerous.

453
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:11,494
Quite possibly she'll display
severe psychotic behavior.

454
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:15,028
The Oakland bureau is here
to orchestrate the search

455
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,539
across the bridge.

456
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:17,768
What if..?

457
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:19,810
What ifshe kills her?

458
00:28:19,878 --> 00:28:22,073
First Doug, now Cindy?

459
00:28:22,147 --> 00:28:24,741
The fact that Kendrick
and her accomplice

460
00:28:24,816 --> 00:28:27,512
murdered the fathers
and abducted the girls

461
00:28:27,586 --> 00:28:29,747
tells us that they
want them alive.

462
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:32,949
I'm sure Cindy's alive
and we'll find her.

463
00:28:37,162 --> 00:28:39,653
And then what do we do?

464
00:29:11,496 --> 00:29:14,556
I'm sorryyou have
to meet this way

465
00:29:14,633 --> 00:29:18,034
but it's the best
for all concerned.

466
00:29:29,314 --> 00:29:33,842
Teena Simmons,
meet Cindy Reardon.

467
00:29:44,396 --> 00:29:47,797
Agent Scully? They found
the light blue Corolla

468
00:29:47,866 --> 00:29:49,390
in the parking lot

469
00:29:49,468 --> 00:29:51,868
ofSan Francisco
lnternational.

470
00:29:51,937 --> 00:29:54,633
Start a check
on every single passenger list

471
00:29:54,739 --> 00:29:57,071
for every fight
that left the terminal

472
00:29:57,175 --> 00:29:59,006
within the past 1 2 hours.

473
00:29:59,077 --> 00:30:01,102
Check every terminal
and make sure

474
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:03,647
she's not hiding out
for a later fight.

475
00:30:03,715 --> 00:30:05,979
Remember, she may have
an accomplice.

476
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:07,951
A motel manager in Pt. Reyes

477
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:11,147
has a guest matching
Sally Kendrick's description.

478
00:30:11,223 --> 00:30:13,418
We found the car
at the airport.

479
00:30:13,492 --> 00:30:15,255
She might have ditched it.

480
00:30:15,327 --> 00:30:18,922
The manager said this woman
checked in with a little girl

481
00:30:18,997 --> 00:30:22,956
that she leaves in the afternoon
by herself, is gone all night

482
00:30:23,034 --> 00:30:24,831
and returns with the girl.

483
00:30:24,903 --> 00:30:26,302
The area is a place

484
00:30:26,371 --> 00:30:28,737
full ofvacationing
families with kids.

485
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,740
This kid said to use chlorine

486
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:34,245
to eradicate the dinofagellates
in the swimming pool.

487
00:30:34,346 --> 00:30:35,813
Sound like someoneyou know?

488
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:38,247
That's it.

489
00:30:38,316 --> 00:30:41,376
I've always kept a close eye
on your behavior

490
00:30:41,453 --> 00:30:42,920
no matterwhere I was.

491
00:30:42,988 --> 00:30:44,250
The last fewyears

492
00:30:44,322 --> 00:30:47,189
I spent in search
ofthe remaining Eve.

493
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:51,161
That, however, was cut short
byyour... activity.

494
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:53,789
I'd hoped mywork
at the Stapes Center

495
00:30:53,865 --> 00:30:56,299
had corrected
the Litchfield faws.

496
00:30:56,368 --> 00:30:57,892
Psychotic behavior

497
00:30:57,969 --> 00:31:01,166
didn't develop
in the Adams and Eves

498
00:31:01,273 --> 00:31:04,731
until age 1 6,
homicidal behavior at 20.

499
00:31:04,843 --> 00:31:07,334
Imagine my... disappointment

500
00:31:07,445 --> 00:31:12,246
when I learned
ofyour accelerated development.

501
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:19,786
How did you learn
ofeach other's existence?

502
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:21,951
Wejust knew.

503
00:31:22,027 --> 00:31:25,360
Did you discuss
howyou would orchestrate

504
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,523
your little... prank?

505
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,590
Wejust knew.

506
00:31:29,668 --> 00:31:32,728
Why murderyour fathers?

507
00:31:37,442 --> 00:31:39,307
They weren't our fathers.

508
00:31:39,377 --> 00:31:41,106
We have no parents.

509
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:42,908
We weren't born.

510
00:31:42,981 --> 00:31:45,074
We were created.

511
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:49,177
You... You
cannot think that way.

512
00:31:49,254 --> 00:31:52,121
You're human beings...

513
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,852
different, special...

514
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:58,760
butyou cannot give in
to genetic destiny.

515
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,957
That's why I've taken you.

516
00:32:01,032 --> 00:32:04,229
I was raised by a man
who knew what I was.

517
00:32:04,302 --> 00:32:08,170
He was a genetic engineer
on the project.

518
00:32:08,273 --> 00:32:10,434
With the proper environment

519
00:32:10,542 --> 00:32:14,103
and a program
oflong-term medication...

520
00:32:14,212 --> 00:32:17,340
you can become like me.

521
00:32:17,415 --> 00:32:21,283
And not
the other Eves.

522
00:32:21,353 --> 00:32:23,617
( rattling )

523
00:32:36,034 --> 00:32:39,401
Wh-What..? What haveyou done?

524
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:40,995
Your soda--

525
00:32:41,106 --> 00:32:43,700
Four ounces offoxglove.

526
00:32:43,808 --> 00:32:45,036
Extracted

527
00:32:45,143 --> 00:32:47,043
from a digitalis plant.

528
00:32:47,112 --> 00:32:48,943
This much is
a lethal dose.

529
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:52,108
We cultivated them
ourselves.

530
00:32:52,183 --> 00:32:53,980
Wh-Why?

531
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:55,110
You tell us.

532
00:32:55,186 --> 00:32:56,653
You made us.

533
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:59,554
Cindy:
We'reyour mistake.

534
00:33:01,293 --> 00:33:04,729
I-l'll...

535
00:33:04,796 --> 00:33:07,899
correct... that mistake.

536
00:33:30,088 --> 00:33:32,249
Well, I waited
likeyou told me.

537
00:33:32,324 --> 00:33:33,018
No one's come in or out
that I could tell.

538
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:34,285
( glassbreaking )

539
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,553
Get the back!

540
00:34:09,094 --> 00:34:10,755
We were all supposed
to drink

541
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:12,888
but we only
pretended to drink it.

542
00:34:12,997 --> 00:34:14,965
They tried to poison us.

543
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:17,091
Who's they?

544
00:34:17,202 --> 00:34:19,796
She and another lady.

545
00:34:19,871 --> 00:34:23,238
What did
the other lady look like?

546
00:34:28,546 --> 00:34:30,377
Eve 8.

547
00:34:30,448 --> 00:34:32,473
Theywere working together.

548
00:34:37,021 --> 00:34:38,420
It's all right.

549
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,355
We'll take care ofyou.

550
00:34:40,425 --> 00:34:42,290
You're safe with us.

551
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,710
It looks like
the Eves mixed

552
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:02,542
about four ounces
ofdigitalis

553
00:35:02,614 --> 00:35:03,979
in each glass.

554
00:35:04,048 --> 00:35:05,948
Their own mini-Jonestown.

555
00:35:06,017 --> 00:35:08,815
Eve 6 said theywere prone
to suicide.

556
00:35:08,887 --> 00:35:10,445
It has a sweet favor.

557
00:35:10,522 --> 00:35:13,150
It's probably not even
perceptible in soda.

558
00:35:13,224 --> 00:35:16,193
So far, there's no sign
ofthe other suspect.

559
00:35:16,261 --> 00:35:19,253
We'll have an officer
take the girls back.

560
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,093
No, maybe it would be best

561
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:23,667
if we take responsibility
for the girls.

562
00:35:23,735 --> 00:35:26,135
We can get them
checked out by a doctor.

563
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:27,432
Okay, whatever.

564
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:28,938
Okay.

565
00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:33,169
Come on, girls.

566
00:35:33,244 --> 00:35:35,235
We're going
to takeyou back.

567
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:36,507
Backwhere?

568
00:35:36,581 --> 00:35:38,572
What's going
to happen to Teena?

569
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,244
We'll talk about it
in the car, okay?

570
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:50,352
They've already grown
so attached.

571
00:35:50,462 --> 00:35:51,861
It will be hard

572
00:35:51,963 --> 00:35:54,431
when Teena's placed
in foster care.

573
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,783
Agent Mulder, I have to
go to the bathroom.

574
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:23,191
Me too.

575
00:36:23,261 --> 00:36:24,455
Can you hold it?

576
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:26,724
I really need to go.

577
00:36:26,831 --> 00:36:29,425
I could use some caffeine.

578
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:42,813
Mulder:
Hi.

579
00:36:42,881 --> 00:36:44,178
Where's your bathroom?

580
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:46,649
In the back. You'll need a key.

581
00:36:46,718 --> 00:36:48,811
Thanks.

582
00:36:48,887 --> 00:36:51,117
Oh, can I get four diet sodas?

583
00:36:51,189 --> 00:36:52,486
- Regular.
- Regular.

584
00:36:52,557 --> 00:36:57,085
All right. Two diet
and two regular. To go, please.

585
00:36:57,161 --> 00:36:58,594
Thanks.

586
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:25,651
Tina:
AgentScully, my door'sstuck.

587
00:37:25,723 --> 00:37:27,384
Scully:
Justasecond.

588
00:37:40,104 --> 00:37:41,594
just a minute.

589
00:37:41,673 --> 00:37:44,141
It's okay.
My dad will pay for them

590
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:46,403
when he gets out
ofthe bathroom.

591
00:37:46,477 --> 00:37:47,774
Okay.

592
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:09,724
Those are the diet?

593
00:38:09,834 --> 00:38:11,927
I think these are.

594
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,508
Areyou sure? It's really sweet.

595
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:18,701
Try it.

596
00:38:18,776 --> 00:38:20,403
It's diet.
I saw her pour it.

597
00:38:20,478 --> 00:38:21,877
Okay.

598
00:38:21,946 --> 00:38:23,413
Scully:
Let's go.

599
00:38:26,384 --> 00:38:27,749
Come on.

600
00:38:29,621 --> 00:38:31,054
Don't forget the drinks.

601
00:38:31,122 --> 00:38:32,646
Ah, the drinks.

602
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:38,018
How much?

603
00:38:38,129 --> 00:38:39,153
Five dollars.

604
00:38:39,263 --> 00:38:40,321
Okay.

605
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:41,557
Want to pay?

606
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:42,724
Sure.

607
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:45,200
Thereyou go.

608
00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:46,634
You got those?

609
00:38:46,704 --> 00:38:48,296
Thanks.

610
00:39:03,187 --> 00:39:05,018
Mmm, tastes syrupy.

611
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,855
Cindy,
you didn't pick up my keys

612
00:39:10,962 --> 00:39:13,453
offthe counter, did you?

613
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:14,963
No.

614
00:39:15,033 --> 00:39:17,661
No? All right.
I'll be right back.

615
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:54,001
Scully!

616
00:39:54,672 --> 00:39:55,798
What?

617
00:39:55,873 --> 00:39:57,431
Scully...

618
00:40:00,078 --> 00:40:02,876
just wanted to open
the car door foryou.

619
00:40:05,316 --> 00:40:08,308
Mulder!

620
00:40:08,386 --> 00:40:10,251
It's them. They poisoned it.

621
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:11,913
Let'sjust get them

622
00:40:11,989 --> 00:40:12,956
in the car.

623
00:40:13,024 --> 00:40:14,184
Okay.

624
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,155
I only had a sip.

625
00:40:17,228 --> 00:40:19,924
We didn't drink enough
to make us sick.

626
00:41:12,316 --> 00:41:13,578
Stop it!

627
00:41:13,651 --> 00:41:15,448
Scully! I got them!

628
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,452
Leave me alone!

629
00:41:16,521 --> 00:41:17,419
I got them!

630
00:41:17,488 --> 00:41:19,080
Scully!

631
00:41:19,157 --> 00:41:21,421
Hey!

632
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:24,558
What the hell areyou doing?

633
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:26,426
I'm a federal agent.

634
00:41:26,497 --> 00:41:29,091
And these are
America's Most Wanted?

635
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:30,426
Hands in front.

636
00:41:30,535 --> 00:41:32,002
Leave me alone!

637
00:41:32,103 --> 00:41:33,730
Now let the girls go.

638
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:37,001
Get in the truck, girls.
I'll call the police.

639
00:41:37,074 --> 00:41:38,439
We are the police!

640
00:41:50,188 --> 00:41:52,122
Theywent that way.

641
00:41:57,328 --> 00:41:59,956
You seen the twins we were with?

642
00:42:00,031 --> 00:42:02,192
No, l...

643
00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:04,427
There's a bunch ofschoolkids

644
00:42:04,535 --> 00:42:06,560
just left
on that bus.

645
00:42:50,648 --> 00:42:52,081
Forgetyour sodas?

646
00:42:52,149 --> 00:42:53,946
We didn't do
anything wrong.

647
00:42:54,018 --> 00:42:55,576
We'rejust
little girls.

648
00:42:55,653 --> 00:42:57,917
That's the last thingyou are.

649
00:43:03,127 --> 00:43:06,221
They said they have
an excellent program.

650
00:43:06,297 --> 00:43:07,855
Mulder:
They can't hide

651
00:43:07,932 --> 00:43:10,230
behind a bureaucracy,
Mrs. Reardon.

652
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:13,167
You have every right to know
what happened--

653
00:43:13,237 --> 00:43:15,569
a right to know
aboutyour daughter.

654
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,974
All I need to know is
she was not my daughter.

655
00:43:20,044 --> 00:43:22,035
She neverwas.

656
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,474
Hello, girls.

657
00:44:06,223 --> 00:44:09,056
It's so nice to have company.

658
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,731
Sign for this.

659
00:44:52,903 --> 00:44:54,803
Hello, Eve 8.

660
00:44:57,608 --> 00:44:59,075
We've been waiting.

661
00:44:59,143 --> 00:45:01,236
How did you know
I'd come foryou?

662
00:45:01,312 --> 00:45:02,836
Wejust knew.

663
00:45:02,913 --> 00:45:04,403
Wejust knew.
