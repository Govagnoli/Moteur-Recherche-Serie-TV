1
00:00:01,481 --> 00:00:03,847
(loud rock music plays)

2
00:00:27,374 --> 00:00:29,308
(inaudible conversation)

3
00:00:36,516 --> 00:00:39,246
(inaudible conversation)

4
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,987
(amorous moaning)

5
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:58,120
(panting)

6
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:02,868
Oh!

7
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:04,368
God!

8
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:05,370
That was...

9
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,371
That was incredible.

10
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,873
I mean it.

11
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:10,933
(panting)

12
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:13,070
You don't believe me.

13
00:02:14,347 --> 00:02:17,043
Can you hear me?

14
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:18,880
Hey, l...

15
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:21,182
I don't even knowyour name.

16
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:41,005
Oh...

17
00:04:31,985 --> 00:04:34,044
New York businessman calls
his wife to say good night.

18
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:35,746
Then picks up some chippy.

19
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:37,550
Brings her back for sex.

20
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:40,320
Beyond that,
nothing makes sense.

21
00:04:40,393 --> 00:04:41,417
How's that?

22
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:43,519
Security monitor
records the victim

23
00:04:43,597 --> 00:04:46,088
entering with a woman at 1 0:1 3.

24
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,758
The same monitor records a male

25
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,165
Ieavingjust after midnight.

26
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:51,294
Couldn't she have changed clothes?

27
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:52,338
Thought ofthat.

28
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:53,895
Male is definitely
a different person--

29
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:56,135
Short hair and at least
30 pounds heavier.

30
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:58,268
No record ofhis entry

31
00:04:58,345 --> 00:05:00,779
nor ofthe chippy leaving.

32
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:03,748
Scully:
30 foors up, no other egress.

33
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,943
Did the medical examiner
establish a cause ofdeath?

34
00:05:06,052 --> 00:05:08,247
Guy blew an artery.

35
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:10,118
Must have been
some roll in the hay.

36
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,455
It's hard to imagine
in this day and age

37
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:17,291
someone having sex
with a perfect stranger.

38
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:19,525
Signs ofrobbery?

39
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:21,191
The male exited wearing

40
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:23,531
the victim's suit,
carrying a suitcase

41
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:24,831
and the wallet's gone.

42
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:27,873
I don't even know
whywe got this call.

43
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:29,238
Really.

44
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:30,606
Somebody at the Bureau

45
00:05:30,677 --> 00:05:33,805
put out a memo requesting
any case involving this C.O.D.

46
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,347
I assumed it was a...

47
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:36,404
Thanks for the call.

48
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:41,983
Five deaths, four in six weeks

49
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:43,680
between here and Boston.

50
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,725
In each case, the victim dies
in the throes ofpassion.

51
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:49,591
Two women and three men,
including the last one.

52
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:51,290
All young, healthy adults.

53
00:05:51,364 --> 00:05:53,855
All with symptoms
ofmassive coronary arrest.

54
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:55,696
A new drug on the streets?

55
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:57,828
The oldest drug--
not even illegal.

56
00:05:57,904 --> 00:06:00,998
Each body showed
huge amounts ofpheromones.

57
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:03,201
The chemicals animals secrete?

58
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:04,538
You mean sexual attractants.

59
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:07,011
Radar love--
a hundred times stronger

60
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,570
than found in nature.

61
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:09,637
Strong enough to produce

62
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:11,581
anaphylactic shock
or a coronary.

63
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:14,654
Soyou think somebody
is synthesizing them?

64
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:17,053
It's been done, but in nowhere
near these concentrations

65
00:06:17,123 --> 00:06:21,150
and, Scully,
you're going to love this.

66
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:23,058
The pheromones we're talking about?

67
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:24,858
They contain human DNA.

68
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:27,024
Well, there's still a question

69
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,160
as to whether humans
can produce pheromones

70
00:06:30,236 --> 00:06:31,260
so how can that be?

71
00:06:31,337 --> 00:06:33,134
I don't know, but ifit's true

72
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:35,538
this guy's a walking aphrodisiac.

73
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:37,701
He's the ultimate sex magnet.

74
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:39,608
He? Or she?

75
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:41,704
You've got victims ofboth sexes.

76
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:44,306
Both a man and a woman
on the hotel security monitor.

77
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:46,146
That is a puzzle.

78
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:47,947
So what's our profile
ofthe killer?

79
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:50,545
Indeterminate in height,
weight, sex.

80
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:52,750
Unarmed,
but extremely attractive.

81
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:54,225
It gets weirder.

82
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:56,660
There's been four deaths
matching this M.O.

83
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,254
in the last six weeks.

84
00:06:58,331 --> 00:07:01,823
In Boston, Hartford,
Philadelphia

85
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:03,095
and here in Washington.

86
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:05,660
The killer's moving south.

87
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:07,900
There was a death I made
a note ofabout a year ago

88
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:09,407
with the same symptoms.

89
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:12,138
A 32-year-old U.M.W. Iabor
organizerwas found dead

90
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:13,975
outside a town
called Steveston

91
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:15,947
in the woods of Massachusetts

92
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:19,917
home to a sect
ofreligious isolationists

93
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:21,476
called the " Kindred."

94
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:24,284
Right. They live up there
without electricity, phones

95
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:26,825
any modern amenities--
Iike the Amish.

96
00:07:26,926 --> 00:07:28,484
The Kindred are known

97
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:30,188
for their handmade stoneware pottery.

98
00:07:30,263 --> 00:07:31,958
They mine the clay.

99
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:34,158
What's so weird about that?

100
00:07:34,234 --> 00:07:37,931
The white clay in those hills
is particular to that region.

101
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:39,835
It's also the same substance

102
00:07:39,906 --> 00:07:42,704
I scraped out ofthe scratches
on the latest victim.

103
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:44,209
Wait. Aren't these people

104
00:07:44,277 --> 00:07:47,713
famous for their abstinence
and pure Christian ways?

105
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:51,080
Yes, but it looks
as ifone ofthem forgot

106
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:53,152
to clean under his fingernails.

107
00:08:15,308 --> 00:08:16,570
Hi.

108
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:18,474
This is Federal Agent Scully.

109
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:19,739
I'm Agent Mulder.

110
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:21,440
We're investigating a possible murder.

111
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:23,505
There aren't many killings
around here.

112
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:29,582
What can you tell me
about the Kindred?

113
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:31,919
They keep pretty much
to themselves, huh?

114
00:08:33,793 --> 00:08:36,455
Some folks say they're
doing ceremonies--

115
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:38,156
voodoo or something.

116
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:40,028
I've got nothing
against them myself.

117
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:41,191
They bring in the tourists.

118
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:42,962
They letyou take pictures?

119
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:45,231
Those are from back in the '30s.

120
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:46,465
What about the missing ones?

121
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:49,372
I'm having them reframed.
They're under the counter.

122
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:50,431
Can I look at them?

123
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,205
Sure.

124
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:19,302
How would I get up to see them?

125
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:21,840
Well, they don't like
strangers up there much.

126
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:24,843
The road's in pretty rough shape.

127
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:26,970
Steveston.

128
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:31,081
That's them now.

129
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:32,446
They usually shop
at the feed store.

130
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:43,853
Whoa, boy.

131
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:14,625
Excuse me. Ladies.

132
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:18,225
I think I'm going to go inside.

133
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:20,630
You need anything
from the feed store?

134
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:29,704
Hi.

135
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:46,090
She must have problems
on the asphalt.

136
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,423
Has she ever thrown a shoe?

137
00:10:52,732 --> 00:10:54,723
What's her name?

138
00:10:57,603 --> 00:10:59,093
Alice.

139
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:02,605
That's sweet.

140
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:05,337
Did you name her?

141
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:10,108
We named her all together.

142
00:11:10,183 --> 00:11:13,414
I'm not allowed to talk outside.

143
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,282
That's all right.

144
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:20,359
I'm Dana Scully.

145
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:24,925
I don't mean you any harm.

146
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:12,711
Scully, what areyou doing?

147
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,608
I wasjust talking.

148
00:12:25,658 --> 00:12:27,148
You all right?

149
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,626
Yeah. I think so.

150
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:31,526
You want to sit down?

151
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,039
Interesting way oflife.

152
00:12:50,116 --> 00:12:51,913
You get any sense about them?

153
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:56,147
There's something up there, Mulder.

154
00:12:56,255 --> 00:12:58,246
I've been saying that foryears.

155
00:13:23,116 --> 00:13:26,608
Oh, for a four-wheel drive.

156
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:35,524
Looks like about a mile walk.

157
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:37,586
Afteryou.

158
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:44,565
Now...

159
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:49,097
this... that's west.

160
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,301
What does the map say?

161
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,901
That we should be there already.

162
00:14:00,186 --> 00:14:01,517
(sighs)

163
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:03,179
(stick breaking)

164
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,383
Mulder, look.

165
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:07,391
Hmm?

166
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:16,230
We're F.B.I. agents!

167
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:17,291
Federal police.

168
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,565
I'm Agent Mulder.
This is Agent Scully.

169
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:21,766
We're investigating a murder.

170
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:22,772
I'm going to have to askyou

171
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,274
to remain at a distance.

172
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:25,332
Please, sir.

173
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:28,242
Man #1 :
Yourweapons are forbidden here.

174
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:32,080
We can outlastyou at this spot.

175
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:35,416
You're not leaving until your guns

176
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:37,854
are handed to our council.

177
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:39,551
You will have them again
as you leave.

178
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,058
We can't do that.

179
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:42,424
Woman: Please.

180
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:46,693
I'm SisterAbby.
This is Brother Oakley.

181
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:47,698
We are all saddened

182
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:49,064
bywhat has happened
in yourworld

183
00:14:49,135 --> 00:14:51,069
but it does not concern us.

184
00:14:51,137 --> 00:14:54,538
Up here, no one kills another, ever.

185
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:57,201
Wejust want to have
a few questions answered.

186
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,768
Yourweapons are
unwelcome here, notyou.

187
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,314
Come and praywith us.
Be one ofus.

188
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:05,782
You'll see we harm no one.

189
00:15:05,851 --> 00:15:08,411
Please relinquish yourweapons.

190
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:14,426
Please.

191
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:34,736
Now there is no reason
to be afraid.

192
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,123
Come... sit.

193
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:50,287
Let us pray as one.

194
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:51,482
(man coughing)

195
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:53,457
SisterAbby:
We who are separate give thanks

196
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:56,086
for our allotted time on this world.

197
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:58,926
We ask for strength

198
00:16:58,998 --> 00:17:01,523
that we may bring forth
the bounty that God

199
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,931
has provided.

200
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:04,196
Amen.

201
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,636
And we pray for the day
ofthe coming

202
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:08,606
the moment ofour release.

203
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,868
All: Amen.

204
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:12,800
Let us eat.

205
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:18,850
I was wondering
ifwe might ask a few questions.

206
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:21,580
We're looking for someone
who may have come from here.

207
00:17:21,654 --> 00:17:22,746
We have pictures.

208
00:17:22,822 --> 00:17:24,153
We don't allow pictures.

209
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,850
A crime has been committed.

210
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:27,916
We have questions
we need answered

211
00:17:27,993 --> 00:17:30,928
ifyou'll forgive us.

212
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:35,560
What are these pictures?

213
00:17:35,634 --> 00:17:38,398
Hotel securityvideos
ofa man and a woman

214
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:39,768
who may have committed a murder.

215
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,431
Where was it committed?

216
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:43,475
In a hotel in Washington, D.C.

217
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:45,874
Mulder: lfyou look
at the videotape

218
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:49,381
maybeyou can identify
the individual.

219
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,951
How much violence has
this person caused in yourworld?

220
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:55,987
Five murders so far.

221
00:17:56,055 --> 00:18:00,651
And may kill again,
which is whywe need your help.

222
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:02,318
Has anyone left recently?

223
00:18:02,395 --> 00:18:03,453
(hand slapping table)

224
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:05,793
Yourworld does not interest us.

225
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:08,629
We have no need for
yourviolence oryour questions.

226
00:18:11,771 --> 00:18:15,298
I've said what is needed.

227
00:18:15,408 --> 00:18:17,933
They have no right to be here
at this time.

228
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:22,039
BrotherWilton, stand.

229
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,514
Before we can accept
any man's person

230
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:32,181
we must accept our own.

231
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:34,692
And I askwho can stand
in your sight

232
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,318
when onceyou are angry?

233
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:39,125
I am ashamed to lift up my face

234
00:18:39,198 --> 00:18:42,964
and I shall not be ashamed
in this evil time.

235
00:18:43,035 --> 00:18:45,560
Make atonements for this wrath,
BrotherWilton.

236
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:51,436
That's all right.

237
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:52,909
We didn't take any offense.

238
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:55,776
Anger, as violence,
is not tolerated.

239
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:57,338
Our brother must be admonished.

240
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,908
(choking)

241
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:02,452
He can't breathe.

242
00:19:02,521 --> 00:19:04,318
He does not need your help.

243
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:07,685
He's choking to death!

244
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:11,527
Remove BrotherAaron
from the dining hall.

245
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:16,526
We did not inviteyou here
to interfere.

246
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:18,593
We take care ofour own.

247
00:19:23,576 --> 00:19:26,170
(rock music blaring)

248
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,289
Would you like to dance?

249
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:50,028
Not right now.

250
00:19:51,637 --> 00:19:55,573
I'm really not interested, okay?

251
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:58,474
just one dance.

252
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:03,576
Yeah.

253
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:05,844
One dance.

254
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:19,590
It's a mile toyour car.

255
00:20:19,665 --> 00:20:22,190
Stay on the path.

256
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:32,672
Thanks foryour cooperation.

257
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:44,314
Mulder: The Addams family
finds religion.

258
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,551
Scully: Take me back
to the 20th century.

259
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,422
You believe all that
back there, Scully?

260
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:49,654
Believe all what?

261
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:52,697
All that "we take care
ofour own" business?

262
00:20:52,765 --> 00:20:56,326
They better, or that man at
the dinner table is a dead man.

263
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:58,393
I think it was all
an elaborate act.

264
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,767
What, the choking?

265
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:02,773
No. All this simple life crap.

266
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:04,433
These people know something.

267
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:05,737
You can see it in their eyes--

268
00:21:05,844 --> 00:21:07,141
The way they look at one another.

269
00:21:07,246 --> 00:21:08,941
Do they know who the murderer is?

270
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:11,608
They didn't answer a single question

271
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:14,083
and that outburst was right on cue.

272
00:21:14,153 --> 00:21:17,054
Somehow we answered their questions.

273
00:21:17,122 --> 00:21:18,919
Whyweren't there any children?

274
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:20,583
I know. That was odd.

275
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:22,251
You know what's really odd?

276
00:21:22,328 --> 00:21:24,728
You know those pictures
we saw in Steveston today

277
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:26,958
the ones from the '30s?

278
00:21:27,032 --> 00:21:30,365
I saw some ofthose same faces
at dinner tonight.

279
00:21:30,436 --> 00:21:33,405
They've probably
been intermarrying foryears.

280
00:21:33,472 --> 00:21:35,963
Maybe.

281
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,474
Maybe not everything

282
00:21:37,576 --> 00:21:38,770
is as black and white
as it appears.

283
00:21:38,877 --> 00:21:40,936
What areyou doing?

284
00:21:41,046 --> 00:21:44,072
I'm going to go back
for a little look-see.

285
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,165
Mulder:
Maybe theywent to the movies.

286
00:22:03,235 --> 00:22:04,167
(distant chanting)

287
00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:05,464
You hear that?

288
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:07,471
Uh-huh.

289
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,592
(horse whinnies)

290
00:23:26,218 --> 00:23:30,416
(horse whinnies)

291
00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:14,191
What doyou think?

292
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:16,996
I think I want to see
what's in that cellar.

293
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:05,216
Come with me.

294
00:25:05,284 --> 00:25:08,014
I can giveyou information.

295
00:25:40,886 --> 00:25:42,854
(chanting)

296
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:20,290
I know who did it.

297
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:22,793
The murders?

298
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:24,294
You've heard our prayers.

299
00:26:24,396 --> 00:26:26,887
You've seen how we live
our beliefs.

300
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:29,490
I wantyou to find this killer.

301
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:31,899
I wantyou to find him for me.

302
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:35,673
He was my best friend.

303
00:26:35,741 --> 00:26:38,141
What's his name?

304
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,576
Brother Martin.

305
00:26:40,646 --> 00:26:43,513
I called him Marty.

306
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:21,551
Martywas different.

307
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,815
What doyou mean, different?

308
00:27:26,224 --> 00:27:28,021
How does he kill?

309
00:27:28,093 --> 00:27:30,926
We're not sure.

310
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:33,463
All ofthe victims
died ofcardiac arrest.

311
00:27:33,532 --> 00:27:35,523
He poisons them, doesn't he?

312
00:27:35,634 --> 00:27:38,000
Maybe. How doyou know that?

313
00:27:51,984 --> 00:27:54,475
I need to showyou something.

314
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:56,714
Something about Marty.

315
00:28:50,642 --> 00:28:54,237
We found them out on Route 44.
We were wandering.

316
00:28:54,312 --> 00:28:55,677
Marty and I used to do that.

317
00:28:55,747 --> 00:28:57,237
Explore the edges ofourworld.

318
00:28:57,315 --> 00:28:59,909
Somebody must have left them
for garbage.

319
00:28:59,985 --> 00:29:01,612
They are garbage.

320
00:29:01,686 --> 00:29:03,244
Why did you keep them?

321
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:05,551
It was Martin who kept them.

322
00:29:05,624 --> 00:29:07,592
Some ofwhat I saw
in the magazines--

323
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:08,887
Some ofit was beautiful

324
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,621
but most ofit I didn't like.

325
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:13,163
It was garish,
but Martin... Marty

326
00:29:13,231 --> 00:29:14,323
he couldn't get enough.

327
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:17,300
He liked even the paper
it was printed on. Slick.

328
00:29:19,404 --> 00:29:21,998
Martywas captured byyourworld.

329
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:23,769
He left us to become one ofyou.

330
00:30:05,684 --> 00:30:08,585
(clattering)

331
00:30:43,188 --> 00:30:45,315
BrotherWilton.

332
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,051
- The woman has returned.
- Where is she?

333
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,922
With Andrew in the main house.

334
00:30:48,994 --> 00:30:50,723
The other one?

335
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:52,990
He's missing.

336
00:30:53,098 --> 00:30:55,532
Come.

337
00:31:20,325 --> 00:31:21,986
You said Martywas different.

338
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,029
Yes.

339
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:28,389
How?

340
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:30,195
How did he kill his victims?

341
00:31:30,268 --> 00:31:31,963
I could be banished.

342
00:31:32,037 --> 00:31:35,131
Does it have something to do
with the ceremony in the barn tonight?

343
00:31:49,955 --> 00:31:52,355
What areyou doing?

344
00:31:55,694 --> 00:31:56,922
(whispering:)
Scully.

345
00:32:12,344 --> 00:32:15,245
Marty is different.

346
00:32:15,313 --> 00:32:16,905
We're all different.

347
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,453
Oh.

348
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:26,279
No.

349
00:32:27,892 --> 00:32:29,359
No.

350
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,864
Scully?

351
00:32:36,668 --> 00:32:38,863
Get offofher!

352
00:32:53,218 --> 00:32:56,244
I asked you not to interfere.

353
00:33:36,695 --> 00:33:38,629
What wereyou doing back there?

354
00:33:38,697 --> 00:33:39,789
I don't know.

355
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:42,298
- You don't know?!
- No.

356
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:44,062
(retching)

357
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,729
Areyou all right?

358
00:33:47,806 --> 00:33:50,707
(rock music playing)

359
00:33:57,782 --> 00:33:59,943
I wasn't ignoring you.

360
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:02,042
No. Ofcourse I sawyou.

361
00:34:02,153 --> 00:34:03,677
I just...

362
00:34:03,788 --> 00:34:05,255
I didn't recognizeyou.

363
00:34:05,357 --> 00:34:07,655
That's all.

364
00:34:07,726 --> 00:34:08,852
Excuse me.

365
00:34:08,927 --> 00:34:10,690
I'm having a conversation.

366
00:34:12,497 --> 00:34:14,158
Sorry. No.

367
00:34:14,232 --> 00:34:15,927
Uh-huh.

368
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:51,128
Thanks.

369
00:34:54,272 --> 00:34:55,796
Howyou feeling?

370
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:56,806
Better.

371
00:34:59,677 --> 00:35:01,372
A little embarrassed, actually.

372
00:35:01,446 --> 00:35:04,313
Why? You don't
remember any ofit.

373
00:35:06,651 --> 00:35:08,482
It's like I don't remember...

374
00:35:08,586 --> 00:35:10,349
Why didn'tyou get out
before he..?

375
00:35:10,455 --> 00:35:12,753
He told me he knew
who the killerwas.

376
00:35:12,824 --> 00:35:14,587
How did you know
he wasn't the killer?

377
00:35:16,561 --> 00:35:18,825
I believed him.

378
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:27,167
So what did you see
down in the cellar?

379
00:35:27,238 --> 00:35:30,230
just BrotherWhat's-his-name
buried in some gopher hole

380
00:35:30,308 --> 00:35:33,004
in the wall. Buried alive.

381
00:35:34,078 --> 00:35:35,943
How doyou know he was alive?

382
00:35:36,014 --> 00:35:37,538
I was in there with him

383
00:35:37,615 --> 00:35:39,583
and his face was different.

384
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:41,676
Even his hairwas almost feminine.

385
00:35:41,786 --> 00:35:44,186
Like he was going through
some kind ofa transformation.

386
00:35:44,255 --> 00:35:46,223
Changing sexes?

387
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:49,158
That would explain
the hotel securityvideo.

388
00:35:49,227 --> 00:35:50,626
Soyou're saying these people...

389
00:35:50,695 --> 00:35:51,923
I know what I saw, Scully

390
00:35:51,996 --> 00:35:53,930
and I sawyou about
to do the wild thing

391
00:35:53,998 --> 00:35:55,329
with some stranger.

392
00:36:01,306 --> 00:36:03,206
Think he was trying to kill me?

393
00:36:03,274 --> 00:36:04,798
(sighing)

394
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:06,867
Maybe it's the sex that kills.

395
00:36:06,945 --> 00:36:10,506
Ifhe was trying to kill me,
why did they let us go?

396
00:36:10,582 --> 00:36:13,016
I don't know.

397
00:36:16,187 --> 00:36:17,916
(laughing)

398
00:36:22,861 --> 00:36:23,987
(knocking)

399
00:36:24,062 --> 00:36:26,189
All right, let's break it up.

400
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:27,492
(groaning)

401
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:29,226
Out ofthe car.

402
00:36:33,104 --> 00:36:34,571
Sorry, Officer.

403
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:39,233
You too. You a pro?

404
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,709
Pro?

405
00:36:40,778 --> 00:36:42,268
(groaning)

406
00:36:42,347 --> 00:36:43,279
What?

407
00:36:55,126 --> 00:36:57,560
(gasping)

408
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:03,328
(gasping, coughing)

409
00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:11,735
On a scale ofone to ten,
she was a... kind three.

410
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:16,111
But there was something
about her.

411
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,738
Did she touch you

412
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:19,908
or make any other
physical contact?

413
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:26,420
Her touch was... electric.

414
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:30,427
But after that
I remember... onlyvaguely.

415
00:37:30,495 --> 00:37:31,894
What doyou remember?

416
00:37:31,963 --> 00:37:34,295
Nothing, actually.

417
00:37:34,365 --> 00:37:36,697
Try to remember, Michael.

418
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:38,929
The policeman at the scene
supports whatyou said.

419
00:37:39,003 --> 00:37:42,404
But maybe there was something
unusual about this woman...

420
00:37:42,473 --> 00:37:44,805
something you wouldn't
feel comfortable

421
00:37:44,876 --> 00:37:46,503
telling the police
on the record.

422
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:48,273
- This is offthe record?
- Absolutely.

423
00:37:48,346 --> 00:37:49,574
What did you see, Michael?

424
00:37:55,086 --> 00:37:56,610
After she left the car...

425
00:37:56,721 --> 00:37:57,915
and she was fighting
with the cop

426
00:37:57,989 --> 00:38:00,617
I saw her in her clothes
and she looked like a...

427
00:38:00,692 --> 00:38:01,590
(nervous laugh)

428
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:03,593
She looked like a man.

429
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:07,828
She was a man?

430
00:38:07,899 --> 00:38:10,367
The club scene
used to be so simple.

431
00:38:14,005 --> 00:38:16,030
It's offthe record.

432
00:38:16,107 --> 00:38:18,667
Scout's honor.

433
00:38:22,046 --> 00:38:23,536
Scully: We can't rule out

434
00:38:23,648 --> 00:38:25,707
that we're looking
for a transvestite.

435
00:38:25,817 --> 00:38:27,444
I think DonJuan there
knows the difference

436
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:29,486
between males and females.

437
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:31,613
I don't want us
to ignore the obvious.

438
00:38:31,723 --> 00:38:35,124
How else could a woman
overpower a 200-pound cop?

439
00:38:35,193 --> 00:38:36,524
She was a he.

440
00:38:36,594 --> 00:38:38,221
Woman: Agent Mulder.
Agent Scully.

441
00:38:38,296 --> 00:38:40,423
The credit card stolen
from the last victim in D.C.

442
00:38:40,498 --> 00:38:44,958
wasjust used to order take-out
in a hotel eight blocks away.

443
00:38:45,036 --> 00:38:49,769
Marty (Woman):
It was always forbidden.

444
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:54,608
But after the first time,
I couldn't help myself.

445
00:38:57,749 --> 00:39:03,085
Touching a human man
or a woman...

446
00:39:03,154 --> 00:39:06,453
is as powerful for me
as it was foryou.

447
00:39:10,495 --> 00:39:12,827
This is Agent Scully
requesting police backup

448
00:39:12,897 --> 00:39:14,194
and additional agents

449
00:39:14,265 --> 00:39:17,063
at 771 Catherine Street--
the Hotel Catherine.

450
00:39:17,135 --> 00:39:21,071
Yourworld offers pleasures...

451
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:24,734
pleasures we don't know
because we're different.

452
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:27,607
Butyou know that now.

453
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:30,773
The others will punish me
forwhat I've done.

454
00:39:30,882 --> 00:39:34,374
They'll find me
because the day is coming

455
00:39:34,485 --> 00:39:37,352
and theywon't leave without me.

456
00:39:42,827 --> 00:39:45,455
ScullyWhispers: Mulder.

457
00:39:49,534 --> 00:39:50,558
(knocking on door)

458
00:39:52,203 --> 00:39:54,228
Delivery.

459
00:40:00,111 --> 00:40:01,100
F.B.I.!

460
00:40:01,179 --> 00:40:02,510
F.B.I.! Clear!

461
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,810
Stay down!

462
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:05,883
Dead body!

463
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:10,311
(groans)

464
00:40:11,022 --> 00:40:13,013
Scully?

465
00:40:13,124 --> 00:40:15,319
Scully: I'm okay.

466
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:24,632
(breathing hard)

467
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,688
(whimpers)

468
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:50,455
Scully, down the stairs.

469
00:41:32,336 --> 00:41:34,930
Federal agent! I'm armed!

470
00:41:35,006 --> 00:41:37,497
Back away!

471
00:41:45,683 --> 00:41:46,843
Step away!

472
00:41:50,822 --> 00:41:53,723
Step away.

473
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:56,692
Please... don't hurt him.

474
00:41:59,463 --> 00:42:01,658
No. Step away.

475
00:42:04,602 --> 00:42:06,263
I'm armed.

476
00:42:21,953 --> 00:42:22,885
Mulder: Scully!

477
00:42:43,441 --> 00:42:44,635
The surrounding ten blocks

478
00:42:44,709 --> 00:42:46,677
have been secured
for the past hour.

479
00:42:46,744 --> 00:42:47,802
We set up roadblocks

480
00:42:47,879 --> 00:42:49,403
on all the routes
out to Steveston.

481
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,675
No reports ofthem.

482
00:42:51,749 --> 00:42:54,047
There's no way they could
have gotten through.

483
00:42:54,118 --> 00:42:56,177
What ifthey did get through?

484
00:42:56,254 --> 00:42:58,347
There's only one place
they'd hide.

485
00:43:20,912 --> 00:43:22,743
They're gone.

486
00:43:38,996 --> 00:43:40,861
We found something
in the hay field.

487
00:43:48,873 --> 00:43:49,965
Scully: I don't understand.

488
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:51,372
How can theyjust disappear?

489
00:43:51,442 --> 00:43:53,103
They have no means
oftransportation.

490
00:43:53,177 --> 00:43:55,270
No earthly means
oftransportation.

491
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,092
I made this.
