1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,800
So I spent the night at Todd's.

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,400
You remember Todd, right? The bass player with the big hands.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,565
Big nimble hands.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,600
Angela, I'm trying to piece together a skull.

5
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:17,665
You're doing a great job.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,500
So I wake up this morning and he's sitting there

7
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:22,767
right, no clothes on, just his bass

8
00:00:22,802 --> 00:00:26,000
singing to me in this low, low voice...

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,500
It was creepy.

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,300
Angela, is this conversation really appropriate here?

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,602
Sorry, but I'm into alive people.

12
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,063
Anyway, Todd has a friend...

13
00:00:34,103 --> 00:00:36,307
I thought you said he was creepy?

14
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:38,100
Todd, not the friend.

15
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Good news.

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,865
I hope this is work-related.

17
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,700
The anthropology journal is publishing our piece

18
00:00:44,735 --> 00:00:47,800
on the evolution of the Coronal Suture.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,400
A worthy interruption.

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,400
You're supposed to bump my fist with yours.

21
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,500
Why?

22
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:03,500
I'm told it's a widely acknowledged gesture of mutual success.

23
00:01:03,535 --> 00:01:06,400
I love it when you two impersonate earthlings.

24
00:01:06,435 --> 00:01:07,865
Okay, now, this is weird.

25
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,365
There's some guy in the lounge who asked me to give you this.

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,000
Is he alive? Because that is an excellent start to a relationship.

27
00:01:14,035 --> 00:01:16,400
I didn't put a mirror underneath his nose or anything.

28
00:01:16,435 --> 00:01:18,600
He said you'd know who he was when you opened it.

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,600
Okay, a guy who gets her to stop working.

30
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:30,000
This I have to see.

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,900
You left it at my place.

32
00:01:35,935 --> 00:01:37,300
Three years ago.

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,300
First time I've been in Washington. Thought I should return it in person.

34
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,300
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

35
00:01:43,335 --> 00:01:45,067
What if you didn't take my call?

36
00:01:45,102 --> 00:01:46,951
You're a big important author now.

37
00:01:46,986 --> 00:01:48,800
You could come down here, you know.

38
00:01:48,835 --> 00:01:50,200
You can come up.

39
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,000
Halfway.

40
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,100
As always.

41
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,100
I hope you don't have any expectations.

42
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,650
Do you?

43
00:02:02,685 --> 00:02:03,700
Civility.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,200
I can handle that.

45
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,065
So why are you here?

46
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,000
George Washington university wants to talk to me

47
00:02:10,035 --> 00:02:11,900
about heading their anthropology department.

48
00:02:11,935 --> 00:02:13,517
They'd be lucky to get you.

49
00:02:13,552 --> 00:02:15,100
I assume they tried you first.

50
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,400
I already had a job.

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,700
This is like watching cars mate.

52
00:02:18,735 --> 00:02:20,100
It's gotta be Michael.

53
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,600
Stires... her forensic anthropology professor from Northwestern.

54
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,765
They were...

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,600
Very, very close?

56
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,700
Dr. Brennan is my forensic anthropology professor.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,700
Does that mean...?

58
00:02:33,735 --> 00:02:34,700
No.

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,000
Seems like we should have dinner tonight.

60
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,200
Catch up.

61
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,500
Sounds reasonable.

62
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:40,700
Hey, Bones!

63
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,500
Whoa... okay, put it here. Easy!

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,065
Bones, I got a present for you.

65
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,100
Straight out of an illegal ravine on a dump in Fairfax.

66
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:53,065
See, our forensic people confirmed it was human matter

67
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,500
so rather than open it myself and risk being trashed by you

68
00:02:56,535 --> 00:02:57,765
for contaminating the evidence

69
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,700
I decided to bring the whole refrigerator to you.

70
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,200
All we need is a toaster oven.

71
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,600
Bones.

72
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,200
Body is going to be mostly decomposed.

73
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,400
Which is my cue to leave.

74
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,065
This is where it gets fun.

75
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,800
All right, you can open it. All right.

76
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,700
Ooh... okay.

77
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:28,300
Uh... he or she?

78
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,565
She.

79
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,565
Late teens... early 20s.

80
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,700
I'm guessing she's been in the refrigerator for a year.

81
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,100
Is there enough insect activity to help us be more precise?

82
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:42,000
There's always enough insect activity.

83
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,200
Remove and clean the bones, Zack.

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,400
Michael, you can pick me up at 7:30. I'll give you my address.

85
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,400
Beautiful lab.

86
00:03:51,435 --> 00:03:52,200
Thanks.

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,850
Old friend?

88
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:54,665
Old teacher.

89
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,500
Yeah, they're actually going to eat dinner after seeing this?

90
00:03:59,535 --> 00:04:01,365
Well, I hope it's not soup.

91
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,800
If she was his student and I'm her student, then it follows...

92
00:04:05,835 --> 00:04:07,300
Ain't gonna happen, Zack-O.

93
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:09,200
Not in this universe.

94
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,400
Here's a sketch of the victim.

95
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,400
Her skull was intact, so it made it easy to work with.

96
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,400
I just got her dental records.

97
00:04:23,435 --> 00:04:26,000
Name: Maggie Schilling, 19.

98
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,000
Then I guess you don't need this.

99
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,800
She was a dancer.

100
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,965
Bone markers in her metatarsals.

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,700
To go from the freedom of dance to being crammed into a refrigerator...

102
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,300
I  hope she was already dead when they shut the door.

103
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,100
He's hotter than you said.

104
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,400
Michael?

105
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,900
Any other ex-lovers come knocking on your door today?

106
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:55,617
The "ex" in ex-lover is not a variable.

107
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:57,876
It's a constant, like the speed of light.

108
00:04:57,911 --> 00:05:00,065
Save  your dirty talk for the hunky professor.

109
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,900
I can assure you our relationship is purely platonic.

110
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:05,665
What we share is a love of science.

111
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,700
Neither of us has the time or inclination for emotional complications.

112
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,965
Sounds very reasonable.

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes. I've got to get this data together for Booth.

114
00:05:15,035 --> 00:05:16,000
Sure.

115
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,800
Have a good dinner tonight.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,500
Maggie Schilling went missing 11 months ago.

117
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,100
Parents got a ransom note demanding a million dollars.

118
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:30,900
Negotiations, they dragged on for a couple of weeks.

119
00:05:30,935 --> 00:05:33,065
Then suddenly, all contact stopped.

120
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,200
The assumption was that the kidnappers killed her.

121
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:37,300
No visual physical trauma.

122
00:05:37,335 --> 00:05:37,965
Cause of death?

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,100
Not yet. But there are stress fractures on both wrists.

124
00:05:41,135 --> 00:05:43,665
And we have some people running chemical analysis

125
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,000
and toxicity screens on the effluent in the refrigerator.

126
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,800
Okay. Call me later.

127
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,300
I'm not working tonight. I have a dinner.

128
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,665
What? Wow.

129
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,000
I just assumed that the two of you would be eating off an autopsy table.

130
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,350
Not tonight.

131
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:03,000
I was being...

132
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,300
Tomorrow's fine. Call me tomorrow.

133
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,165
We missed our reservation.

134
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,600
Ah, well, that's the price we pay for scientific exploration and discovery.

135
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,900
You realize that this is just recreational, Michael.

136
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:30,965
Of course.

137
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,100
I'm just impressed that we can just pick up where we left off

138
00:06:33,135 --> 00:06:35,065
like no time has passed.

139
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,665
Time is an imposed construct.

140
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,600
Nice to know we can rely on physics.

141
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,200
You really think you'll move here?

142
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,100
Depends on the offer.

143
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,500
Maybe I could get you a position at the Jeffersonian.

144
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,302
Working for my old student.

145
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,363
Would that be a problem?

146
00:06:53,403 --> 00:06:57,507
We're better when we're not vying for dominance in the same arena.

147
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,665
I can't help it if I'm usually right.

148
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,400
Does that mean you've closed the case on that girl in the fridge?

149
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,700
I found some stress fractures on the wrists. Not much else.

150
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:08,765
I will.

151
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,265
Same old confident Brennan.

152
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,600
I'm sorry; is school in session?

153
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,800
Old habits die hard.

154
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,800
She did fight, Michael.

155
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,600
They kept her... tied up like an animal.

156
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,800
But she fought.

157
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,950
That's how she got those stress fractures

158
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,600
because she was bound and struggling.

159
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,800
I just... I keep seeing her face.

160
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,300
You know how it is.

161
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,100
Using a refrigerator to hide a body...

162
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,565
It's kind of perfect, isn't it?

163
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,100
Good way to remove the victim without being detected.

164
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,765
The rubber gaskets seal in the odor.

165
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Maybe the company should use that in their ads.

166
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,800
She's late. She's never late.

167
00:08:37,835 --> 00:08:39,117
You worried about her?

168
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,400
I'm happy for her.

169
00:08:40,435 --> 00:08:41,465
Why?

170
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Remember that time you were late?

171
00:08:43,535 --> 00:08:45,565
Oh, yeah.

172
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,000
Good morning, all.

173
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,400
You know you can take the day off.

174
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:52,965
You deserve one day.

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,200
Michael wanted to take a look at our equipment.

176
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,065
I'm going to let that one go.

177
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,900
The guys wanted to meet him, anyway.

178
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:00,700
They could learn a lot from him.

179
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,600
You were Brennan's professor?

180
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:05,000
She was 23. An adult.

181
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,665
That's what Clinton said.

182
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,800
You run through a lot of students?

183
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,300
That was a long time ago, and Tempe was very advanced.

184
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:13,800
More colleague than student.

185
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,300
I'm a pretty advanced student.

186
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,300
No offense, but, um, I'm not interested.

187
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,700
No, I meant me and her...

188
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:23,600
Oh! Burned.

189
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,265
What have you found?

190
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,065
X- rays reveal low bone density.

191
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,800
And the parathyroid hormone levels are also low.

192
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,565
There's a medical condition called hyperparathyroidism...

193
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,400
Symptoms include muscle weakness, brittle bones, yeah I know...

194
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:38,600
You may be premature with your struggle theory.

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,065
I doubt that.

196
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,700
You mean you don't want to be doubted.

197
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,565
I  can take it.

198
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,400
The wrist fractures could have resulted from her medical condition.

199
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:47,365
Unlikely. However...

200
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,400
Or be an unrelated cause of nontraumatic fissures.

201
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:52,500
Non-traumatic? Look at these.

202
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,965
It's something to consider.

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,100
Last  thing you want to do is jump to conclusions without evidence.

204
00:09:58,135 --> 00:09:59,665
I know how much you want to find who did this.

205
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,000
This seems like an appropriate moment to discuss human goop.

206
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,865
Chemical analysis of the liver and kidney tissues

207
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,000
reveals significant evidence of the narcotic hydromorphone.

208
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:09,665
Hydromorphone?

209
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,600
Also known as hospital heroin.

210
00:10:11,635 --> 00:10:13,465
In what kind of concentration?

211
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Given her probable size and weight, its fatal.

212
00:10:16,535 --> 00:10:18,200
Where'd you go to dinner last night?

213
00:10:18,235 --> 00:10:19,265
We wound up staying in.

214
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,000
We need to know if that amount accrued over time

215
00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:24,365
or was delivered in one large dose.

216
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,600
You didn't come back to the lab, did you?

217
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:27,865
I made a frittata.

218
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,865
Oh, wow! He cooks, too. Can we share him?

219
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,100
We also need to know if the hydromorphone was administered intravenously or orally.

220
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,517
I should get going. I'm meeting the board of the university.

221
00:10:37,552 --> 00:10:39,900
I'll call you after my appointment. It was nice meeting you all.

222
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,800
What? Is it so odd for everyone to see me with a man?

223
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,000
Print out the levels of hydromorphone you found in her system...

224
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:54,465
I want you to find the overload point

225
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
that could cause the stress fractures in her wrists

226
00:10:56,535 --> 00:10:58,065
and examine the left ilium.

227
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,000
There seems to be some degeneration on the edge.

228
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,200
I know it sounds terrible, but I hoped that she had just run away.

229
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:13,800
That way, I could believe she was still alive.

230
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,400
She started turning against us in high school.

231
00:11:18,435 --> 00:11:19,900
Did a lot of drugs.

232
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,865
We tried to help her...

233
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,565
sent her to rehab, therapy...

234
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,900
Kids have a lot to contend with these days.

235
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,665
We didn't help her, not really.

236
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,665
We had nannies to raise her because we were so busy

237
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,600
and we sent her to shrinks when she had problems instead of talking to her...

238
00:11:35,635 --> 00:11:36,965
You can't blame yourself.

239
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,600
Environment plays a huge role in development.

240
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,100
I'd like some pictures of Maggie so I could compare them with her remains.

241
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:51,600
Pictures of her dancing would be most helpful, or swimming.

242
00:11:51,635 --> 00:11:53,465
How do you know she danced and swam?

243
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,465
Some things can't be erased from the body.

244
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,300
I'm sorry, but I need to ask you about your daughter's drug problems.

245
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,600
Do you know what she was using?

246
00:12:02,635 --> 00:12:05,265
Alcohol, ecstasy, marijuana...

247
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,000
What about the narcotic chydromorphone?

248
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,800
Hospital heroin?

249
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,765
Doesn't sound familiar.

250
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,265
She had a thyroid condition.

251
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,500
Was anything prescribed for that?

252
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,400
Her endocrinologist might know.

253
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,400
We have to find who did this to Maggie.

254
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,100
We have to do this for her.

255
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,265
Maggie's condition didn't respond to medication.

256
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,100
I was trying to get her to agree to surgery when she disappeared.

257
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:36,300
What types of medication are we talking about?

258
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,000
Furosemide, pamidronate. I tried various calcitonins.

259
00:12:40,035 --> 00:12:41,500
What about hydromorphone?

260
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,600
There are no pain issues associated with hyperparathyroidism.

261
00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:46,465
But I knew Maggie had a drug problem.

262
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,700
She was definitely interested in getting some opiates from me.

263
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,765
She  bribed my office manager for samples.

264
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,100
I'm going to need your office manager's home address.

265
00:12:54,135 --> 00:12:55,565
Ex-office manager.

266
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,000
She's going to be what you call a disgruntled employee.

267
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,400
I didn't give Maggie Schilling those samples.

268
00:13:03,435 --> 00:13:05,065
She boosted them herself.

269
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Barragan just blamed me so he'd have an excuse to fire me.

270
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:09,865
Why'd he fire you?

271
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,665
Because he's a horn dog.

272
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,600
I tried to keep things professional.

273
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,065
You know what I mean.

274
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,800
Dr. Barragan said that you were closer to Maggie Schilling than any other patient.

275
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:20,000
You meet her parents?

276
00:13:20,035 --> 00:13:20,965
Yes.

277
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,200
Then you know the poor girl was pretty much on her own.

278
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,465
We took her in.

279
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,400
He said that you went out together, that you took her to clubs.

280
00:13:27,435 --> 00:13:29,500
Well, we just felt sorry for her, you know?

281
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,000
She was lonely, so we showed her a good time.

282
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,500
...Pills, vodka, weed.

283
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,000
Mary wanted Maggie to go to meetings. You know, aa.

284
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,700
That's very kind of you, but let's talk about your new refrigerator.

285
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,100
Why?

286
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,200
Mainly, I'd like to know what happened to your old one.

287
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,065
Well, the fridge we found Maggie in

288
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,400
is a match with the marks on the Costellos' floor.

289
00:14:17,435 --> 00:14:19,365
They're sadomasochistic fetishists.

290
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,465
Yeah. Turned the basement into a "fun room".

291
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,100
Seeking sexual gratification through the manipulation of power.

292
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,500
Probably the oldest of fetishes, master-slave.

293
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,765
It's all about dominance.

294
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,600
Well, this sort of thing only comes up when the bloom goes off the rose

295
00:14:33,635 --> 00:14:34,567
if you know what I mean.

296
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:35,465
I don't know what you mean.

297
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,400
You know, when the regular stuff, when it gets old

298
00:14:37,435 --> 00:14:39,065
you need to spice it up, it's over.

299
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,600
When the sex is good, you don't need any help.

300
00:14:41,635 --> 00:14:42,400
That's for sure.

301
00:14:42,435 --> 00:14:43,065
I'm sorry?

302
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,065
I was agreeing.

303
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,350
Yeah, well, don't, okay? It kind of freaks me out.

304
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,792
I was just saying that I, myself, feel no inclination

305
00:14:48,827 --> 00:14:51,200
toward either pain or dominance when it comes to sex.

306
00:14:51,235 --> 00:14:53,000
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

307
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:55,300
You can be very bossy.

308
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,665
look at him, huh?

309
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,000
Ooh! Look at him, all smiley. I'll bet he just loves these things.

310
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:06,200
But these could explain the stress fractures.

311
00:15:06,235 --> 00:15:08,867
Her bones were brittle from the disease.

312
00:15:08,902 --> 00:15:11,500
Struggling would cause the cracks we saw.

313
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,000
The handcuffs are consistent with the injuries to Maggie Schilling's wrists.

314
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:22,900
Maybe she wanted to be cuffed. Do you ever think about that?

315
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:24,400
Here's what I was thinking-

316
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,065
female, dominant

317
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,400
strapped for cash meets wealthy teenager on the outs with her parents

318
00:15:30,435 --> 00:15:33,300
convinces her submissive husband to hold her for ransom.

319
00:15:33,335 --> 00:15:35,217
Any proof, or is this story time?

320
00:15:35,252 --> 00:15:37,100
You feed her pills to keep her quiet

321
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:38,765
the negotiations, they drag on

322
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,500
so she dies of an overdose before an exchange can be made.

323
00:15:41,535 --> 00:15:42,600
You seal her up in a refrigerator

324
00:15:42,635 --> 00:15:43,565
dump her in a ravine

325
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,700
and you and her honey go back to playing "tie me up" in the basement.

326
00:15:46,735 --> 00:15:48,765
Maggie Schilling was legally an adult.

327
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,265
We don't deny she was in the house, even cuffed.

328
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,700
We don't deny there was a perfectly legal sexual relationship

329
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:55,765
which, by its nature, got rough.

330
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,900
But Maggie was a willing participant.

331
00:15:57,935 --> 00:15:59,565
And enthusiastic.

332
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,100
You have no evidence my clients killed her.

333
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,800
It's weird for you, huh?

334
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,000
Being the one that's all locked up.

335
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,500
The way you come at me...

336
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,600
are you threatened, or do I turn you on?

337
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,300
Now  I'm the one who's hating psychology.

338
00:16:16,335 --> 00:16:18,417
If you don't have anything but those cuffs

339
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:20,500
my clients will be out of here in 24 hours.

340
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,665
I figured it out.

341
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,165
I was right about how she got those fractures.

342
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,465
I just don't have the time, Tempe. I have an appointment.

343
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,700
But I thought you'd want to see. The university can wait a few minutes.

344
00:16:33,735 --> 00:16:36,567
It's not with them, it's with someone they want me to meet.

345
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:39,400
And if we start debating evidence, I'll definitely be late.

346
00:16:39,435 --> 00:16:41,065
Trust me, there's nothing to debate.

347
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,165
I can prove that Maggie Schilling was bound in fur-covered handcuffs.

348
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,000
We found strands of matching fur embedded in her wrists in the scaphoid and the lunate.

349
00:16:49,035 --> 00:16:51,600
But you can't prove that she was involuntarily restrained.

350
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,965
Oh, yes, I can.

351
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,065
It's not a competition.

352
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,300
No, the olympics are a competition.

353
00:16:56,335 --> 00:16:58,500
Ours is a struggle to the death.

354
00:16:58,535 --> 00:16:59,900
Want to bet dinner?

355
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,365
Yes.

356
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,165
If we make it to a restaurant.

357
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,200
Hmm! Bet's on. You got ten minutes.

358
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:07,900
Okay.

359
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,000
You trained her well, doc.

360
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,300
She's brilliant. A little cocky, though.

361
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,900
Yeah, tell me about it.

362
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,000
Pretty good partner, though.

363
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,700
What you see is what you get.

364
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,100
It's a rare quality.

365
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,400
That's just between us, eh?

366
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
Michael?

367
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,700
Dr. Brennan found marks on the medial malleoli, both left and right.

368
00:17:37,735 --> 00:17:38,865
Her legs were bound.

369
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,100
Mirror erosion patterns from the bones rubbing together over time.

370
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:44,165
If this were the result of sex games

371
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
the legs, they wouldn't be bound together.

372
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,700
Well, come on, you know? Looking for a little nookie?

373
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:53,200
Huh? Last thing you tie together are the legs.

374
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,800
I'm not convinced.

375
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,865
Brittle bones from her thyroid condition.

376
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,965
The damage could have happened in a very short time.

377
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,865
We also found evidence of inflammation on her right humerus and ilium.

378
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,700
The bone abnormalities indicate pathosis from lying in one position for a long time.

379
00:18:07,735 --> 00:18:10,565
The only reasonable explanation is long-term bondage.

380
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,900
Decreased bone-density could have caused the inflammation.

381
00:18:12,935 --> 00:18:14,200
This isn't definitive.

382
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,400
I hear there's a nice little French place near here I'd like to try.

383
00:18:17,435 --> 00:18:19,000
I still have five minutes.

384
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,600
My department's still working with Polaroids.

385
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,400
So, what do you think?

386
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,765
Very impressive.

387
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,765
Especially to the non-professional.

388
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,000
You want science? Give me the estimated time of captivity.

389
00:18:37,035 --> 00:18:38,900
Approximately three weeks.

390
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,765
Okay, here are your affected areas.

391
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,300
Now, during an advanced time simulation...

392
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,900
You're winning, right?

393
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,200
Can I see your findings?

394
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,265
This appears to be indisputable.

395
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,100
The narcotic found in her system was not the result of recreational drug abuse.

396
00:19:11,135 --> 00:19:12,967
The inflammation would have been very painful

397
00:19:13,002 --> 00:19:14,701
and the pain would have increased over time.

398
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,868
They kept upping the dose of hydromorphone

399
00:19:16,903 --> 00:19:19,101
until they gave her too much and she died.

400
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:21,300
Those people bound and killed that girl.

401
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,800
I yield. French restaurant?

402
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,100
I'm more in the mood for Italian.

403
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,300
I need to put together the evidence packet for Booth

404
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,867
to deliver to the U.S. Attorney.

405
00:19:31,902 --> 00:19:33,400
I'll meet you at your place.

406
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,765
Do you really think he can handle your success?

407
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,100
What, because of today? We've always been competitive.

408
00:19:45,135 --> 00:19:47,365
I know, but he's a man

409
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,900
and his student, a woman, has surpassed him.

410
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:52,565
Michael is extremely secure, Ange.

411
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,700
Honey, when you stuck it to him today, he was upset.

412
00:19:55,735 --> 00:19:58,700
It was a healthy debate between scientists.

413
00:19:58,735 --> 00:19:59,365
You don't know Michael.

414
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,900
I know men, and I know what happens when two people start sleeping together.

415
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,700
It's not like that. We're friends, colleagues, that's all.

416
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:07,217
Colleagues with benefits.

417
00:20:07,252 --> 00:20:08,665
I don't know what that means

418
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,865
but Michael and I are not involved.

419
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,900
I'm sorry if that's difficult for you to understand

420
00:20:13,935 --> 00:20:16,965
but what we have isn't traditional.

421
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,300
Don't talk to me about traditional, okay? I've dated circus people.

422
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,600
You and Michael, you have something and that's okay.

423
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:27,565
That's good, even.

424
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,700
Just be honest about it.

425
00:20:29,735 --> 00:20:30,700
Bones?

426
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,765
Judge is holding him without bail.

427
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,800
The U.S. Attorney is thinking about sending you flowers.

428
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,600
Facts are facts.

429
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,865
Uh, bones, I have to ask.

430
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,600
How much have you been sharing with the professor?

431
00:20:43,635 --> 00:20:44,917
None of your business.

432
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,165
I mean, on the case.

433
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,565
Oh. I bounce everything off of him.

434
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,200
Well, you got to keep him out of it from now on.

435
00:20:50,235 --> 00:20:51,365
Out of it? Why?

436
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,100
Well, you know that appointment that he had today?

437
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:55,300
Yeah?

438
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,700
He met with the Costellos' lawyer.

439
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,300
Michael is their expert witness.

440
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,100
It's his job to tear apart the case that you've built.

441
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,000
How could I not be upset? Basically, you were spying on me.

442
00:21:12,035 --> 00:21:13,300
Spying?

443
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,800
It's a criminal proceeding.

444
00:21:14,835 --> 00:21:15,965
You're required by law

445
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,600
to disclose all your findings to the defense anyway.

446
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:21,200
I'm only required to provide you with the raw facts

447
00:21:21,235 --> 00:21:22,365
we intend to enter into evidence.

448
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,700
Not the process by which I arrived at those facts.

449
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,200
I apologize. That's a nuance that escaped me.

450
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,665
Why didn't you just tell me, Michael?

451
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,100
Because the defense isn't required to tell the prosecution anything.

452
00:21:36,135 --> 00:21:38,700
In fact, it's grounds for a mistrial.

453
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,800
Look, I've never done this before.

454
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,800
You're the teacher in this situation. I'm the student.

455
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,800
And a little competitive.

456
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,700
Part of the job at the university is to be an expert witness

457
00:21:50,735 --> 00:21:54,200
and yes, I would like to do that job at least as well as you.

458
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,600
But if you feel I've overstepped some boundary here...

459
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,800
I'll back out of the case.

460
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
No.

461
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,200
But if you stay on, you have to move back to the hotel.

462
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,250
Really?

463
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,200
Yes.

464
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,365
Well, would I have to do it tonight

465
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,100
or should I order another bottle of wine?

466
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,100
I suppose tomorrow would be soon enough.

467
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,700
I apologize, Tempe.

468
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,765
He's still at it?

469
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,700
Yep. And it is fascinating.

470
00:22:38,735 --> 00:22:39,865
Keep an eye on him.

471
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,700
That's not going to be a problem.

472
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,200
Did you just give Zack and Hodgins a sign of encouragement?

473
00:22:58,235 --> 00:23:00,700
You know, that's the first time I've been able to look at them

474
00:23:00,735 --> 00:23:04,200
without imagining moe knocking their heads together.

475
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,265
Agent Booth, you're accessing your inner squint.

476
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,900
Tempe, you listed an avulsion fracture on the right femur.

477
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:12,300
Looks minor. Do you consider this evidence?

478
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,750
Dr. Brennan's conclusions belong to the prosecution.

479
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:18,900
I have no interest in destroying your case, agent Booth.

480
00:23:18,935 --> 00:23:20,165
I'm just trying to get a sense of...

481
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,800
of her interpretations of data, to which you are not privy, Dr. Stires.

482
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,517
I understand the game the doctor is trying to play

483
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:29,165
and I'm perfectly capable of dealing with him myself.

484
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,900
I'm sure he's just thrown by findings he would have missed.

485
00:23:31,935 --> 00:23:34,165
This is not about you and Dr. Stires.

486
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,100
This is about the Jeffersonian's reputation

487
00:23:36,135 --> 00:23:38,300
as a source of expert witnesses.

488
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:40,600
Okay, I'm on my own.

489
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,765
Oh, in the interest of fairness

490
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,800
I am willing to share my thoughts with you.

491
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:49,700
I've red-penciled a few things.

492
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,700
You corrected my findings?

493
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,565
Consider it an opposing opinion.

494
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,765
My findings are based on facts, Michael, not opinion.

495
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,500
You seem to have finished your allotted with the remains, Dr. Stires.

496
00:24:01,535 --> 00:24:03,500
I'd like my people to get back to work.

497
00:24:03,535 --> 00:24:04,600
Thank you.

498
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,850
Bones, you okay?

499
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:11,665
Why wouldn't I be?

500
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,200
Because the nutty professor is grading your paper.

501
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:15,700
What'd he give you anyway, huh?

502
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,465
I was always happy with a "B."

503
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,700
Well, I never got a "B" and I never will.

504
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,400
That's my girl.

505
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,065
Assistant U.S. Attorney Levitt

506
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,900
jury consultant Joy Deaver, Dr. Temperance Brennan.

507
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,100
Nice to meet you.

508
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,100
I looked over your findings, and I think we're in good shape.

509
00:24:33,135 --> 00:24:33,765
Thank you. I was...

510
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,500
But juries don't like you.

511
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,765
Excuse me?

512
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,600
I've seen you testify before, Dr. Brennan.

513
00:24:38,635 --> 00:24:40,065
You come off cold and aloof.

514
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,765
- I want to make sure...
- Cold and aloof?

515
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,465
Try not interrupting. It makes you sound arrogant.

516
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,400
Also, don't front-load your testimony with technical crap.

517
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:49,165
This really is not the best approach.

518
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,400
I'm a technical witness. I've testified in over 30 trials.

519
00:24:52,435 --> 00:24:54,200
But most of the experts you've come up against

520
00:24:54,235 --> 00:24:56,065
are as dry and boring as you are.

521
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,300
Now I don't know if you've seen their expert...

522
00:24:58,335 --> 00:24:59,965
She's seen him, Ms. Deaver.

523
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,465
Well, then you understand my concern.

524
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:08,000
Professor Stires is open, charming, great-looking.

525
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,350
Jury's going to love him. I love him.

526
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:12,365
This isn't a personality contest.

527
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,900
It's about data that we present to the jury.

528
00:25:14,935 --> 00:25:16,700
You're kidding, right?

529
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,900
The women on the jury aren't going to be listening to

530
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:20,317
a word that comes out of his mouth.

531
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,665
They're going to be undressing him.

532
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,200
I don't want the men on the jury to be putting more clothes on you.

533
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,765
Wear something blue. It suggests truth.

534
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,600
Make eye contact with the jury, and lose the clunky necklace.

535
00:25:30,635 --> 00:25:33,365
Mary and Scott Costello murdered Maggie Schilling.

536
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,300
The forensic data I've compiled proves that. That should be enough.

537
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:37,465
But it isn't enough.

538
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,665
Okay, that's... that's great.

539
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,200
We'll, uh... take that under consideration. Thanks.

540
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,750
Why didn't she say anything about you?

541
00:25:47,785 --> 00:25:49,742
You can be very irritating sometimes.

542
00:25:49,777 --> 00:25:51,665
Bones, she's an expert just like you.

543
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,900
She has an obvious personality disorder, but she wants to help.

544
00:25:54,935 --> 00:25:57,100
Just try.

545
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,800
Okay, sure.

546
00:25:58,835 --> 00:25:59,700
Good.

547
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,100
I can do it.

548
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,200
We will show that Mary Costello lured Maggie Schilling

549
00:26:27,235 --> 00:26:29,600
into her home with the promise of drugs.

550
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,565
She was not held against her will.

551
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,800
She was, in fact, orchestrating the plot to extort money

552
00:26:34,835 --> 00:26:37,900
from her own parents from whom she was estranged.

553
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,565
They bound her for weeks, the pain growing

554
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,100
and to keep her quiet they pumped her full of drugs.

555
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,600
Her death was the result of a self-administered overdose.

556
00:26:47,635 --> 00:26:48,965
After killing their captive

557
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,965
and ruining their chances of collecting a ransom

558
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,700
the Costellos stuffed Ms. Schilling's body into the refrigerator.

559
00:26:55,735 --> 00:26:58,100
Knowing they could be accused of kidnapping and murder

560
00:26:58,135 --> 00:27:00,517
my clients panicked and disposed of her body.

561
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,026
While their behavior might be ill-advised

562
00:27:03,061 --> 00:27:05,500
they are neither kidnappers nor murderers.

563
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,250
Pharmaceutical samples of hydromorphone

564
00:27:08,285 --> 00:27:10,265
were found in the Costellos' belongings.

565
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,000
The lot numbers matched those that were in Dr. Barragan's office...

566
00:27:14,035 --> 00:27:15,965
When I went in the Costellos' kitchen

567
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,400
I saw the marks from the old refrigerator on the floor.

568
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,100
It was like these marks-they screamed at me-

569
00:27:25,135 --> 00:27:27,700
these people, they did it.

570
00:27:27,735 --> 00:27:28,465
Objection.

571
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,000
Sustained. Just the facts, agent Booth.

572
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:32,065
I'm sorry.

573
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,765
It's just that the receipt for the new refrigerator

574
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,100
was dated two days after the negotiations broke off with the kidnappers.

575
00:27:38,135 --> 00:27:42,165
You figure it out. I know. I'm sorry.

576
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,300
Any evidence Maggie Schilling wasn't a willing participant in sexual activity

577
00:27:46,335 --> 00:27:48,400
involving those cuffsand other paraphernalia?

578
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,600
Winding up in the fridge kind of tells me that she really wasn't that into it.

579
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,965
Your honor? No direct evidence.

580
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,300
Any evidence my clients forced Ms. Schilling to take that narcotic?

581
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,000
I'll leave those answers for the experts.

582
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,800
Sciarids, also known as dark winged fungus gnats

583
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:08,565
went through several life cycles.

584
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,565
Also present were acadidae and anoetidae

585
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,700
but the most interesting find was not a bug at all

586
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,800
but was common bread mold.

587
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,565
All of this data led to the same conclusion:

588
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,600
Maggie Schilling was in that refrigerator between 10 and 12 months.

589
00:28:22,635 --> 00:28:24,365
Even though we already had medical records

590
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,065
and dental records from which to identify Maggie Schilling

591
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,700
I was also asked to do a sketch based on the architecture of her skull.

592
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,900
That's sort of what I do.

593
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Turned out pretty accurate, if I do say so myself.

594
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,400
She was a pretty girl.

595
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,900
That's why I drew her smiling.

596
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,800
It... it just seemed right.

597
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,500
I'm really sorry for what happened to her.

598
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,800
And I hope my work helps you.

599
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,365
The gelatinous puddle was decomposed tissue

600
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,600
from which our lab sextracted and analyzed liver and kidney samples

601
00:29:00,635 --> 00:29:02,065
by mass spectrometer.

602
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,900
The hydromorphone level in her liver was 8.4

603
00:29:05,935 --> 00:29:07,865
and 6.6 in her kidney.

604
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:12,765
Death occurs at 7.7 and 5.2, respectively.

605
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,465
And the reason they would be giving the victim this narcotic?

606
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,200
Short-term periosteal reaction on the right proximal lateral humerus

607
00:29:20,235 --> 00:29:22,900
was consistent with a bound individual...

608
00:29:22,935 --> 00:29:23,265
so to rephrase...

609
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,100
and the placement of wrist restraints

610
00:29:25,135 --> 00:29:27,167
coupled with her hyperparathyroidism

611
00:29:27,202 --> 00:29:29,165
would account for the stress fractures

612
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,000
on the distal anterior surface of both the radii and ulnae.

613
00:29:33,035 --> 00:29:36,800
Her bones broke because she was struggling to free herself?

614
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,300
Yeah, I believe I just said that.

615
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,765
Thank you, doctor.

616
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,600
That will be all for now.

617
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,565
I'd like to move for a recess

618
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,000
with the right to recall the witness, your honor.

619
00:29:52,035 --> 00:29:55,400
Okay. We will meet back here in 30 minutes.

620
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,965
She can't connect.

621
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,600
Those killers are going to walk.

622
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,465
It was well-reasoned.

623
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,665
Yeah, it was very scientific.

624
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,150
You didn't listen to a thing I said.

625
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:10,392
You were like klaatu the robot up there.

626
00:30:10,427 --> 00:30:12,600
Would it have killed you to speak English?

627
00:30:12,635 --> 00:30:14,965
I wore blue. I looked at the jury.

628
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,450
Look, for a people person, you're a little rude.

629
00:30:17,485 --> 00:30:19,900
At what point do the facts stop working for you?

630
00:30:19,935 --> 00:30:21,265
I have no problem with the facts

631
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,350
as long as the jury can understand them.

632
00:30:23,385 --> 00:30:25,365
You're underestimating their intelligence.

633
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,065
You're overestimating their ability to stay awake.

634
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,600
When these S&M perverts walk on this, it'll be on your head.

635
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,400
Can you believe that?

636
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,700
What, you agree with her?

637
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,965
Not entirely.

638
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,265
Not entirely? So, that means partly.

639
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,700
Well, I was perfectly clear. Didn't you think I was clear?

640
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,700
Sometimes. And, um...

641
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,000
sometimes you were...

642
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,065
a little hard to follow.

643
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,100
What are you talking about? When?

644
00:30:55,135 --> 00:30:58,765
When you were... talking.

645
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,600
Listen, bones, I know you care about this case

646
00:31:00,635 --> 00:31:02,000
but I think you should let them see that.

647
00:31:02,035 --> 00:31:02,867
So I should perform?

648
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:03,665
Just a little bit, yeah.

649
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,600
I mean, do you see how I portrayed myself as a no-nonsense, tough-guy cop?

650
00:31:07,635 --> 00:31:09,600
You are a no-nonsense, tough-guy cop.

651
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:10,165
Exactly.

652
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,500
And I think that it wouldn't hurt if the jury saw

653
00:31:12,535 --> 00:31:13,365
who you really are.

654
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,100
Well, I don't know who you think that is, Booth

655
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:18,800
because this is who I really am. Just this.

656
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,000
Oh, God, sorry.

657
00:31:24,035 --> 00:31:26,100
I'm okay. Are you?

658
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:27,300
Sure.

659
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,000
Well, truthfully, this whole thing is pretty awkward.

660
00:31:32,035 --> 00:31:33,100
Don't you think?

661
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,800
We're just doing our job. We'll be fine.

662
00:31:35,835 --> 00:31:38,017
It's just they have this jury consultant-

663
00:31:38,052 --> 00:31:40,126
they want to turn this into a melodrama.

664
00:31:40,161 --> 00:31:42,165
They don't understand what a scientist is.

665
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,700
Tempe, we're not allowed to talk about the case.

666
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,865
I know, I'm just saying...

667
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,100
my guy's going to freak if he sees us talking.

668
00:31:47,135 --> 00:31:49,100
Sure. Sorry.

669
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,165
In my opinion, the high levels of hydromorphone

670
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,400
are more consistent with recreational use than for pain relief.

671
00:31:57,435 --> 00:31:58,800
Could you explain?

672
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,200
Well, I might not use all the technical language

673
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:05,500
but I'll try to make myself understood.

674
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,900
Objection, your honor. The witness is impugning another witness.

675
00:32:09,935 --> 00:32:10,900
Sustained.

676
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,165
Continue.

677
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,265
I'm sorry. I don't do this professionally.

678
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,200
People who need to relieve physical pain will stop after the pain disappears.

679
00:32:19,235 --> 00:32:22,600
It doesn't take more than an average dose to accomplish that.

680
00:32:22,635 --> 00:32:25,765
Drug users are trying to bury emotional pain

681
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,665
which means that they'll medicate until they feel nothing.

682
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,600
This is why they have a tendency to overdose, like Maggie Schilling.

683
00:32:32,635 --> 00:32:33,365
That's not accurate.

684
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,700
Sometimes intense chronic pain does not respond to medication.

685
00:32:36,735 --> 00:32:38,367
I'll bring that up in cross-examination.

686
00:32:38,402 --> 00:32:39,965
What about Dr. Brennan's claim that her pain

687
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
was somehow connected to the victim being bound for a length of time?

688
00:32:43,035 --> 00:32:46,300
Well, the Costellos have already stipulated to the fact

689
00:32:46,335 --> 00:32:47,265
that they bound Ms. Schilling

690
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,400
as part of their rather unorthodox sexual life.

691
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:55,200
And Dr. Brennan agrees that Ms. Schilling had hyperpara-

692
00:32:55,235 --> 00:32:57,065
well, if I could simplify-

693
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,200
a thyroid condition that could weaken her bones.

694
00:33:00,235 --> 00:33:02,965
No need to look for bondage scenarios.

695
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,500
That's ridiculous. He's ignoring all the facts.

696
00:33:06,535 --> 00:33:10,000
With respect to my former student Dr. Brennan

697
00:33:10,035 --> 00:33:10,765
with findings like these

698
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,465
I don't know why she became a forensic anthropologist.

699
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,300
She seems to have ignored all but her preconceived notions about the case.

700
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,850
Objection.

701
00:33:18,885 --> 00:33:19,992
Sustained.

702
00:33:20,027 --> 00:33:21,065
I apologize.

703
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,300
Do you disagree with Dr. Brennan's data?

704
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,300
Well, sometimes doctors can use data to confuse a very simple situation.

705
00:33:29,335 --> 00:33:31,800
I mean, I'm a doctor and I could hardly follow her.

706
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,150
This case is about people, not incomprehensible technical jargon.

707
00:33:36,185 --> 00:33:40,100
I don't think that these people should be convicted of murder

708
00:33:40,135 --> 00:33:42,600
just because Dr. Brennan sounds smart.

709
00:33:42,635 --> 00:33:43,965
Your honor, really.

710
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,500
The jury will disregard professor Stires' personal view of Dr. Brennan.

711
00:33:48,535 --> 00:33:50,500
Court will adjourn until 9:00 A.M. tomorrow.

712
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,500
He wasn't acting as an objective expert. He was making up a story.

713
00:33:58,535 --> 00:34:00,000
The judge chastised him in front of the jury.

714
00:34:00,035 --> 00:34:01,065
That'll work for us.

715
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,200
The hell it will. The jury loves Stires.

716
00:34:04,235 --> 00:34:05,665
He looks like a regular guy

717
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,400
who's not allowed to speak the truth

718
00:34:07,435 --> 00:34:09,467
because the stupid rules get in the way.

719
00:34:09,502 --> 00:34:11,465
The rules of juris prudence aren't stupid.

720
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,900
Dr. Brennan, you need to learn the difference between reality and perception.

721
00:34:15,935 --> 00:34:18,165
A trial is all about perception.

722
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,900
Wow. You are the reason civilization is declining.

723
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,065
Talk to her.

724
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,700
I kind of agree with her.

725
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,565
Thanks.

726
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,050
I really don't agree with you

727
00:34:31,085 --> 00:34:32,500
I just... I don't like her.

728
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,465
Put me back on the stand.

729
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,400
I can rebut everything that Michael said.

730
00:34:36,435 --> 00:34:37,500
She can do this.

731
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,100
I'll think about it.

732
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,400
I've never been in this position before, Booth.

733
00:34:43,435 --> 00:34:45,165
I need to get back up there.

734
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
All right, just let me talk to him.

735
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,000
Trial going badly?

736
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,800
You don't usually cram at the last minute.

737
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,200
The jury likes Michael better than they like me.

738
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,300
Apparently, that's a problem.

739
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,200
Are they stupid?

740
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,665
Compared to you, yes, they are stupid.

741
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,900
However, compared to you, most of the world is a little stupid.

742
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,400
You have many skills, Temperance.

743
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,400
Not one of them includes communicating with the average person on the street.

744
00:35:27,435 --> 00:35:29,800
Which is exactly what juries are made of.

745
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,350
I'm a better forensic anthropologist than Michael Stires.

746
00:35:33,385 --> 00:35:36,200
Which is why, two years ago, I hired you instead of him.

747
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:37,600
Michael applied for this job?

748
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,865
Yes.

749
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,400
His credentials are better than mine.

750
00:35:40,435 --> 00:35:42,400
Yes. But...

751
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,300
you are the more rational, reasoned, empirical scientist.

752
00:35:48,335 --> 00:35:49,900
And you care.

753
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,500
And if he tries to convince you otherwise, tell him to go to hell.

754
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,400
Is it safe to approach, Dr. Brennan?

755
00:36:06,435 --> 00:36:08,365
Don't charm, Michael.

756
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,700
I think you're taking this too personally.

757
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:11,500
You think I should be more rational?

758
00:36:11,535 --> 00:36:12,265
Yes.

759
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:12,865
Go to hell.

760
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,100
Look, you're not the only one with a jury consultant.

761
00:36:15,135 --> 00:36:16,165
The difference is, I listened to mine.

762
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,000
He told me to create reasonable doubt, that's what I did.

763
00:36:19,035 --> 00:36:21,000
This one isn't about winning a pasta dinner

764
00:36:21,035 --> 00:36:23,165
or showing up your former student.

765
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,700
It's about putting two people away who murdered a 19-year-old girl.

766
00:36:26,735 --> 00:36:28,517
Tempe, you can't personalize the work.

767
00:36:28,552 --> 00:36:30,265
Do you remember, in central America

768
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,700
standing in a mass grave being guarded by soldiers?

769
00:36:32,735 --> 00:36:35,100
We knew that they were probably the same soldiers

770
00:36:35,135 --> 00:36:37,600
who killed the people we were digging up.

771
00:36:37,635 --> 00:36:39,565
I was just a student.

772
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,600
I was scared, I turned to you and I asked, "what do we do?"

773
00:36:42,635 --> 00:36:45,600
That was a different place and a radically different context.

774
00:36:45,635 --> 00:36:50,300
You said, "we tell the truth. We do not flinch. "

775
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,500
You flinched, Michael.

776
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,865
I can't ask her that.

777
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,000
The whole line of questioning isn't relevant.

778
00:37:01,035 --> 00:37:02,567
He brought it up during his testimony

779
00:37:02,602 --> 00:37:04,065
so legally you can reintroduce it.

780
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,800
I don't see how it's going to change anything.

781
00:37:05,835 --> 00:37:07,700
Trust me, it will.

782
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,900
Am I testifying?

783
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,865
Only a prolonged struggle, not sexual activity

784
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,000
would cause the tearing of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle

785
00:37:19,035 --> 00:37:20,600
on the distal portion of the bone...

786
00:37:20,635 --> 00:37:22,067
so, in lay terms.

787
00:37:22,102 --> 00:37:23,501
The muscle avulsed.

788
00:37:23,536 --> 00:37:24,900
She pulled a muscle.

789
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,600
Because she was immobilized.

790
00:37:26,635 --> 00:37:27,165
Tied-up.

791
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,500
Yes. These conditions have to be contextualized.

792
00:37:30,535 --> 00:37:32,600
The inflammation on both the ilium and...

793
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,800
Dr. Brennan, why did you become a forensic anthropologist?

794
00:37:42,835 --> 00:37:43,965
I beg your pardon?

795
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,965
There must be a reason you chose this field

796
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,800
out of the hundreds of other careers someone of your intelligence could have chosen.

797
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:52,200
Was there some emotional reason, perhaps?

798
00:37:52,235 --> 00:37:53,965
Objection. Relevance, your honor.

799
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,065
I don't see how this pertains to the case.

800
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,800
Dr. Brennan is cold, distant and alienating, your honor.

801
00:37:58,835 --> 00:37:59,565
Hey...!

802
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,065
I need the jury to understand why she's so cold

803
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,300
so that they might be willing to accept her testimony.

804
00:38:04,335 --> 00:38:06,517
Her personality issues aren't relevant to this case.

805
00:38:06,552 --> 00:38:08,700
They opened up this line of questioning, your honor.

806
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:11,017
When Dr. Stires was on the stand he wondered

807
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:13,265
why Dr. Brennan became a forensic anthropologist

808
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,550
so the defense must have thought it had some relevance then.

809
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:19,800
Sorry, Mr. Meredith, you did raise the issue. Overruled.

810
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,200
You may continue, Mr. Levitt.

811
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,665
Dr. Brennan, your parents disappeared when you were 15

812
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,400
and no one's ever found out what happened to them, isn't that correct?

813
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,100
Please answer the question, Dr. Brennan.

814
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,700
That's correct.

815
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,100
It must be very painful.

816
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,465
Is it fair to say that you have been trying

817
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,900
to solve the mystery of their loss your whole life?

818
00:38:51,935 --> 00:38:53,565
Do I want answers? Yes.

819
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,250
As to how that has affected my behavior

820
00:38:55,285 --> 00:38:56,900
which I assume is what you're trolling for

821
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:59,065
I don't put much stock in psychology.

822
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,465
Is that why you wrap yourself up in techno speak?

823
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,200
So you won't have to feel how these victims remind you of your own parents?

824
00:39:04,235 --> 00:39:07,000
How I feel doesn't matter. My job doesn't depend on it.

825
00:39:07,035 --> 00:39:09,000
But it's informed by it.

826
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,300
Or are you as cold and unfeeling as you seem?

827
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,700
I see a face on every skull.

828
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,500
I can look at their bones and tell you how they walked, where they hurt.

829
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,600
Maggie Schilling is real to me.

830
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,400
The pain she suffered was real.

831
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,000
Her hip was being eaten away by infection from lying on her side.

832
00:39:42,035 --> 00:39:44,465
Sure, like Dr. Stires said

833
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,200
the disease could contribute to that

834
00:39:46,235 --> 00:39:48,465
if you take it out of context.

835
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:52,000
But you can't break Maggie Schilling down into little pieces.

836
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,600
She was a whole person. Who fought to free herself.

837
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,200
Her wrists were broken from struggling against the handcuffs

838
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:03,100
the bones in her ankles were ground together

839
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:04,665
because her feet were tied

840
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:09,000
and her side, her hip and her shoulder were being eaten away by infection.

841
00:40:09,035 --> 00:40:11,200
And the more she struggled, the more pain she was in

842
00:40:11,235 --> 00:40:14,000
so they gave her those drugs to keep her quiet.

843
00:40:14,035 --> 00:40:16,100
They gave her so much it killed her.

844
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,500
These facts can't be ignored or dismissed because you think I'm...

845
00:40:22,535 --> 00:40:25,967
boring or obnoxious. Because I don't matter.

846
00:40:26,002 --> 00:40:29,400
What I feel doesn't matter. Only she matters.

847
00:40:29,435 --> 00:40:30,900
Only Maggie.

848
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,800
Tempe, Tempe. Tempe, I'm sorry.

849
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,600
What can I do?

850
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,600
Bones...

851
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,965
Costellos are trying to cop a plea

852
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
to a charge that won't mean the death penalty.

853
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:52,900
They know they're going down.

854
00:40:52,935 --> 00:40:54,865
You had no right.

855
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,665
There are things that are private.

856
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,965
Yeah, maybe you're right. But you know what?

857
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,100
This was my case, too. All right? So, nothing personal?

858
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,600
Guilty on all counts.

859
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,900
Yeah.

860
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,900
So he owes you another dinner, huh?

861
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,800
No, I won't be seeing him anymore.

862
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,600
Sorry.

863
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,200
I was foolish to be so open with him. It was irrational.

864
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,000
You know how you get when you're tired.

865
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
Yeah.

866
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,500
You want to go out, grab a drink?

867
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,400
I think I just want to work.

868
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,500
Okay.

869
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,165
Hey, Bones.

870
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,100
What is it? I'm not feeling very forgiving.

871
00:41:58,135 --> 00:42:01,600
Yeah, I know. But we have a case.

872
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,565
Victim is an adult male, 35 to 40 years old.

873
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,000
From the pattern of the burning I'd say an accelerant was used.

874
00:42:28,035 --> 00:42:28,700
Could you hand me my bag?

875
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,200
Yeah. Sure.

876
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,900
Hey, listen, you want my coat or something? It's cold up here.

877
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,900
If I did, I'd ask for it.

878
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:35,900
Yeah.

879
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,900
Sorry. And, um...

880
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,600
I'm sorry.

881
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,165
You had something to accomplish

882
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,400
you found a logical way of getting what you needed.

883
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,800
I probably would have done the same thing.
