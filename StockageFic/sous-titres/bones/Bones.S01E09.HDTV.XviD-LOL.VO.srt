1
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:23,000
Sweetie...

2
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:25,234
Angela, I don't want to.

3
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,467
Sweetie, could you
stop galloping

4
00:00:26,534 --> 00:00:27,801
for, like, two seconds?

5
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:28,933
Better able to
withstand peer pressure

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,267
when you can't catch me.

7
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:31,567
Call it a favor, okay?

8
00:00:31,634 --> 00:00:33,167
How does me going

9
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:34,801
to a company Christmas
party do you a favor?

10
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,634
Remember what
happened last year?

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,002
I didn't go last year.

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,063
Yeah, exactly.
And it took me weeks

13
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:41,807
to collect
all those photocopies.

14
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:43,300
I need you.
Friends don't let friends

15
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:45,567
photocopy their butts
at company Christmas parties.

16
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:47,300
Hey, there's
a Secret Santa.

17
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:48,801
I don't like Secret Santa.

18
00:00:48,868 --> 00:00:50,967
The idea that we are
forced by convention

19
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:53,367
to exchange meaningless gifts.

20
00:00:53,434 --> 00:00:54,834
Yeah, yeah, I know.

21
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,933
If you rearranged
"Secret Santa" though,

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,634
you get "Secret Satan."

23
00:00:57,701 --> 00:00:59,868
What possible meaning
could that have?

24
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:01,868
I've already had an eggnog,
if you can't tell.

25
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:04,167
Now how am I going
to enjoy this party

26
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:06,200
knowing that my best friend
in the whole world

27
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:10,234
is in the lab, eyeball
to eyeball with Skeletor.

28
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,868
Who?

29
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:13,933
He's a cartoon villain
who looks like a...

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,134
You know, his name
is self-explanatory.

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,601
Would you please just
come to this party?

32
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:20,967
20 minutes.

33
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:22,000
BOOTH:
Bones.

34
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:23,734
All right.

35
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:25,067
Merry Christmas, Seeley.

36
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,701
What are you, an Elf?

37
00:01:28,768 --> 00:01:31,434
Yes. What's wrong with
a little Christmas spirit?

38
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:34,200
What's the context?

39
00:01:34,267 --> 00:01:35,933
Federal property
on Dupont Circle

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,134
where Congress puts up visiting
agricultural specialists

41
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,768
or something like that, they're
digging to put in a solarium,

42
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:43,534
and they find
a fallout shelter

43
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:45,000
with a skeleton inside.

44
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:46,434
How long was it in there?

45
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:47,933
The shelter was built
in the '50s,

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,434
part of that whole
A-bomb panic.

47
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:50,900
It's not a suicide.
Why not?

48
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:52,367
Hole in the head,
you see the gun.

49
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:53,868
It's a suicide.

50
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:55,401
He shoots himself in
the head and somehow

51
00:01:55,467 --> 00:01:56,801
his arm ends up
across his chest?

52
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:58,401
Bring the skeleton in,

53
00:01:58,467 --> 00:01:59,933
I'll prove it wasn't
a suicide.

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,434
Merry Christmas, Bones.

55
00:02:02,534 --> 00:02:04,701
Come on, boys, bring it in.

56
00:02:04,768 --> 00:02:08,067
Oh, no, we're going
to the company Christmas party.

57
00:02:08,134 --> 00:02:10,100
You go ahead, I'll do
a cursory examination

58
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:11,834
and I'll meet you
in a few minutes.

59
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,900
All right.

60
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,933
There you go.

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,601
Booth, will you
escort Angela

62
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:18,300
to the Christmas party

63
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:20,467
and make sure she doesn't
photocopy her butt?

64
00:02:20,534 --> 00:02:21,933
Oh, no,
I can't do that.

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,501
You see, I got some
really last minute

66
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:25,167
important Christmas shopping
that I got to do.

67
00:02:25,234 --> 00:02:26,167
It's not last minute
until tomorrow.

68
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:27,134
Come on, Bones.

69
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,467
Bones...

70
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:30,334
Just... I got to...

71
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:31,334
Jeez.

72
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:33,933
Stop.

73
00:02:36,134 --> 00:02:37,601
( <i>louder</i> ):
Stop.

74
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,534
Turn.

75
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:46,334
Your robot
reminds me of you.

76
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:48,033
You tell it
to turn, it stops.

77
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,734
You tell it to stop,
it turns.

78
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:51,367
You ask it to
take out the garbage,

79
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:53,134
it watches reruns
of <i>Firefly.</i>

80
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,734
After I fix the voice
recognition protocols,

81
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,601
this is going to blow
those gomers at MIT away.

82
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:01,768
Hey, we've got about half
a liter of pure alcohol here.

83
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:03,434
Dump it in the eggnog,

84
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:05,501
and we've got the best
Christmas party in history.

85
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,000
I brought an eggnog.

86
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:25,634
I can't drink while I work.

87
00:03:25,701 --> 00:03:27,434
Good thing I didn't
bring it for you.

88
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:29,200
Crystal in accounting
is after you, isn't she?

89
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:31,200
Oh, like Alien
after Predator.

90
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:32,334
Sit.

91
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:44,367
What do you got there?

92
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:46,900
Two open tickets to Paris.

93
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:48,067
One way.

94
00:03:48,134 --> 00:03:49,900
Pan Transit Airlines.

95
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:51,467
They're blank.

96
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:53,467
Pan Transit went out
of business in the '60s.

97
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,100
I thought you were
at the party.

98
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:56,501
( <i>groans</i> ):
It wasn't a party,

99
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:57,834
it was a <i>Star Wars</i>
convention.

100
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,701
This was still in the skull.

101
00:04:01,768 --> 00:04:03,167
( <i>whistles</i> ):
.22 caliber.

102
00:04:03,234 --> 00:04:04,534
It  matches the gun
he was holding.

103
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:05,667
Did you open up
the suitcase?

104
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:07,367
Nope.
Why not?

105
00:04:07,434 --> 00:04:09,634
Could hold information that
would compromise my objectivity.

106
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:11,801
Yeah, like a name
and address?

107
00:04:11,868 --> 00:04:13,868
I prefer to make unbiased,
initial observations.

108
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:15,868
Is  that pure alcohol?

109
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:17,634
Yes, Dr. Brennan.

110
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:19,967
You really think Goodman's going
to let you spike the eggnog

111
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,701
after the Fourth
of July fiasco?

112
00:04:21,768 --> 00:04:24,100
( <i>sighs</i> ):
We may have to rethink.

113
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:25,267
Zack, I need you
to clean these bones.

114
00:04:25,334 --> 00:04:26,234
Now?

115
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,501
Ha! Burned.

116
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,868
And I need you
to search the clothing

117
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:31,200
for insect evidence.

118
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:33,401
Jeez, Bones, Merry Christmas.

119
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:34,801
MONTENEGRO:
Okay.

120
00:04:34,868 --> 00:04:36,167
You people
listen to me.

121
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,300
There is a party
going on

122
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:38,768
upstairs, okay?

123
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:41,067
A Christmas party.
We're going up there.

124
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:43,467
We're going to talk
to some people,
we're going to sing

125
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,601
some carols, we're going
to drink some eggnog.

126
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:46,900
You are going

127
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:47,801
to kiss me under
the mistletoe.

128
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:49,367
On the lips.

129
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:52,200
I might kiss you guys
under the mistletoe, too.

130
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:54,200
Maybe even you.

131
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:55,467
In a festive,

132
00:04:55,534 --> 00:04:56,933
non-lesbian manner.

133
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,367
But we are
going to that party.

134
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:06,067
Put on a mask, I'm going to take
a couple core samples.

135
00:05:06,134 --> 00:05:08,467
Okay.

136
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:37,134
What's that?

137
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,601
Biological contamination.

138
00:05:47,868 --> 00:05:48,900
Okay.

139
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:50,401
The doors seal
automatically.

140
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:51,967
Don't worry about it.

141
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:53,768
What do you mean
don't worry about it?

142
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:55,768
There's no use panicking
until we know what it is.

143
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:56,634
What what is?

144
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,102
Uh, we might know.

145
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,263
I cut into the fallout
shelter bones

146
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,407
and the biohazard
alarm went off.

147
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:03,667
Were you conforming
to autopsy protocol?

148
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:05,200
One of us was.

149
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:08,067
The other was
drinking an eggnog.

150
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,801
And you didn't have
your mask on?

151
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:10,900
( <i>groans</i> ):
Oh...

152
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,567
That pathogen is
coccidioidomycosis.

153
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:22,768
Valley fever?

154
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:24,000
It was picked up
in the scanner

155
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:25,067
in the discharge vent

156
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,667
at Mr. Addy's station.

157
00:06:26,734 --> 00:06:28,634
What's valley fever?

158
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:30,401
It's a fungus
that can lead

159
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:32,267
to pneumonia, meningitis,
spontaneous abortion...

160
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:33,567
death.

161
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:35,667
The alarm sounded
shortly after Mr. Addy

162
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:38,067
cut into a human bone.
That must've been the source.

163
00:06:38,134 --> 00:06:40,667
Was he following
autopsy protocol?

164
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,300
Of course. However...

165
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:45,033
I was drinking
an eggnog.

166
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,634
And now he's there with you
breathing the same air.

167
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:49,067
Hey, I got into

168
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:50,534
the decontamination shower
with Zack.

169
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:52,401
Haven't I been through
enough hell?

170
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:53,434
Is he contagious?

171
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:54,701
Dr. Hodgins may have

172
00:06:54,768 --> 00:06:56,367
inhaled the spores, yes.

173
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:58,200
Okay, it must suck
to be Hodgins right now,

174
00:06:58,267 --> 00:06:59,734
but the rest of us,
we didn't inhale.

175
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:01,900
So it's okay that I go, right?

176
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:04,501
Dr. Hodgins may have
exhaled the spores all over us.

177
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:06,367
We have no choice but
to impose quarantine.

178
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:08,667
Valley fever can be fatal

179
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:10,734
and we can't risk
a pandemic.

180
00:07:10,801 --> 00:07:12,967
Just calm down and let us
handle things from this side.

181
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,634
BOOTH:
Anyone besides me

182
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,900
worried that a guy dressed
like Santa is in charge?

183
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:18,834
Merry Christmas.

184
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,801
Okay, you know what,
if this is fatal,

185
00:07:20,868 --> 00:07:22,334
I will shoot both of you.

186
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,701
Maybe you guys

187
00:07:23,768 --> 00:07:24,900
could go get dressed.

188
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:37,567
Sync:FRM-xxy
-=http://www.1000fr.com=-

189
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:07,701
I zapped the bones
with ultraviolet light

190
00:08:07,768 --> 00:08:09,234
and arranged them
in the isolation tables

191
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:11,100
so we won't have to worry
about spores.

192
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:13,501
In addition, I found this sewn
into the lining of his clothing.

193
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,267
A woman's wedding band.

194
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:17,234
Two tickets to Paris,
a wedding band...

195
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:18,900
a picture begins to form.

196
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:21,401
We don't form pictures,
we accumulate evidence.

197
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,734
Dental  work?

198
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,833
Acrylic resins
in the interior fillings

199
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,567
from the 1940s.

200
00:08:25,634 --> 00:08:27,000
Childhood tibia break,

201
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:28,534
bad enough that
he walked with a limp.

202
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:30,768
Also, he wore a toupee.

203
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,701
Doesn't  seem
to have degraded.

204
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:35,467
It's made of a synthetic
called dynel.

205
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:37,301
It couldn't have looked good.

206
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:40,768
This is a cocktail of four
anti-fungal drugs

207
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,334
including Amphotericin B

208
00:08:42,401 --> 00:08:44,734
Orally, you'll be
taking ketoconazole,

209
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,401
fluconazole,
and itraconazole.

210
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:47,900
That's great.
Then we can leave?

211
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:49,634
We won't know for
a couple of days

212
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:52,167
if the fungus took hold
in your system.

213
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:54,900
Whoa, whoa, you're saying that
we're stuck here over Christmas?

214
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,800
Look, you know, I have...

215
00:08:58,867 --> 00:09:00,701
places to go, you know,
I have obligations.

216
00:09:00,768 --> 00:09:02,467
We all have obligations.

217
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:03,768
I'm supposed to go to Quebec.

218
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,501
Hey, who's fault is this?

219
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:06,833
Who forced me to go the party
where I drank too much

220
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,401
and had to hide from Crystal?

221
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:10,034
Who never should've
cut into a bone

222
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,601
with a drunken fool
in the room?

223
00:09:11,668 --> 00:09:13,134
Who brought us human remains

224
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,401
just to ditch a little
paperwork?

225
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:16,401
Oh, wait, you're saying
that this is my fault?

226
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:18,100
You knew Dr. Brennan
could not resist.

227
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,367
Well, I'd have been
able to resist

228
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,634
if I was in Niger
where I wanted to be.

229
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:21,601
You're blaming me?

230
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:22,967
Ladies and gentlemen,

231
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:24,833
we'll have sleeping bags
delivered.

232
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,701
Please have your
loved ones call me

233
00:09:26,768 --> 00:09:27,933
and we'll set up some kind of
safe quarantine visit

234
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,768
on Christmas Eve.

235
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,434
Oh, and be prepared
for side effects.

236
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,734
Nausea, fever, insomnia?

237
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,501
In very rare cases,
euphoria,

238
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:37,134
dream state,
mild hallucinations.

239
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,634
I'll take that, please.

240
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:39,833
Early symptoms

241
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,134
mimic a common cold.

242
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,634
What if it manifests?

243
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:44,401
First treatment protocol
involves

244
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:45,967
extremely painful injections
into the base of the brain.

245
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:47,100
BOOTH:
You know what?

246
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:48,768
I've never realized

247
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:52,768
how pretty all this
shiny stuff is.

248
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,434
That is so not fair.

249
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:03,267
* Maybe this Christmas
will mean... *

250
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:05,434
Tomorrow I was supposed
to leave for Quebec.

251
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:08,301
Want to know
the true meaning of Christmas?

252
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:10,601
It's being inside
a 300-year-old inn

253
00:10:10,668 --> 00:10:12,334
with a French-Canadian masseuse

254
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:13,967
when there's ten feet
of snow outside.

255
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:15,900
Christmas is going home
to Michigan

256
00:10:15,967 --> 00:10:17,200
and heading into the woods
with your brothers

257
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:18,833
to cut a 12-foot Christmas tree,

258
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,267
and you all decorate
it together,

259
00:10:20,334 --> 00:10:21,501
brothers, sisters,

260
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,234
nieces, nephews...

261
00:10:23,301 --> 00:10:25,601
40 people who all love you
and are happy to see you.

262
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:27,167
That, my friend,

263
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:29,734
is  the true meaning
of Christmas.

264
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:34,800
Nah, I'm going to have to go
with the masseuse on this one.

265
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:42,668
What are those little tiny
lights dancing on the ceiling?

266
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:44,933
For the third time, those are
minute firings

267
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,800
of neurons
on your optic nerve

268
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:50,701
due to your reaction
to the antifungal cocktail.

269
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:53,634
They're beautiful.

270
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:58,134
You are stoned, Agent Booth.

271
00:10:59,668 --> 00:11:01,134
Oh, good.

272
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,467
Let's hope it lasts long enough
to keep this from being

273
00:11:03,534 --> 00:11:06,134
the worst Christmas
of my life.

274
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,067
What are you complaining about?

275
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,933
I don't like
to boast, but

276
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I am the spirit of Christmas
in my house.

277
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:17,668
I have a wife and twin
five-year-old daughters.

278
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:19,768
We have family traditions,

279
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,434
the most important of which is
being together for Christmas.

280
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:25,567
Wow. They're beautiful.

281
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:28,768
Yeah.

282
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,501
I have a kid, too.

283
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,034
His name's Parker.

284
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,000
He's four years old.

285
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:38,900
His mother wouldn't
marry me, so

286
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:41,334
my parental rights
are totally...

287
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,900
Vague?

288
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:44,601
That word's just
a little bit more Christmassier

289
00:11:44,668 --> 00:11:45,800
than what I was thinking.

290
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:47,567
He's a fine looking boy.

291
00:11:47,634 --> 00:11:49,401
Yeah, I get him
part of Christmas day.

292
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,601
I get him an excellent
present every year.

293
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:53,167
Something really cool.

294
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:55,768
But, uh... this year...

295
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,967
Yeah, it's...
this year.

296
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:02,734
What are those little lights
on the ceiling?

297
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:05,800
I know it's against
your nature,

298
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:07,167
but I need your help.

299
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:08,800
For what?

300
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:10,434
To make Christmas.

301
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:12,601
Why? Because
we're the girls?

302
00:12:12,668 --> 00:12:14,134
Yes.

303
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,000
We have to decorate and we have
to make our own Secret Santa.

304
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:21,034
You called it
Secret Satan before.

305
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,100
It's all so tragic.

306
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,367
A cheap wedding ring
sewn into a suit,

307
00:12:25,434 --> 00:12:26,933
two tickets to Paris.

308
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,367
It makes you wonder,
who was the girl?

309
00:12:29,434 --> 00:12:31,567
Can you imagine
what it was like for her?

310
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:34,134
Waiting and wondering?

311
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,567
Never knowing
what happened?

312
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:37,367
I don't have to imagine.

313
00:12:37,434 --> 00:12:38,501
What do you mean?

314
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:40,100
I'll tell you what I'm going

315
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:43,434
to do for Christmas.

316
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:44,467
Good. Thank you.

317
00:12:44,534 --> 00:12:45,701
At last you decide

318
00:12:45,768 --> 00:12:48,301
to take part.

319
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,334
I'm going
to solve a murder.

320
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:04,668
Bones.

321
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:07,434
It's after midnight. Hmm?

322
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:08,967
Christmas Eve day.

323
00:13:09,034 --> 00:13:12,334
Both an eve and a day,
it's a Christmas miracle.

324
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:16,267
Still enjoying your
medication, I see.

325
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:22,768
Okay, so, what
are we looking at.

326
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,100
There are traces of lead
and nickel

327
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:27,134
in the dead guy's
osteological profile.

328
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,434
You don't seem too upset
about missing Christmas.

329
00:13:30,501 --> 00:13:31,933
Indications are that Christ,
if he existed,

330
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,734
was born in the late spring

331
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,034
and that the celebration
of his birth was shifted

332
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,701
to coincide with
the pagan rite

333
00:13:36,768 --> 00:13:38,301
of the winter solstice

334
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:39,933
so that early Christians weren't
persecuted.

335
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,701
Mmm. What are you, like,
the Christmas killer?

336
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:44,401
It's the truth.

337
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:47,567
Well,  it sounds like the truth
cause it's so rational, right,

338
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:49,967
but, you know, the true truth
is that you just...

339
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:53,034
you hate Christmas,
so you just spout out

340
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,967
all these facts and you
ruin it for everyone else.

341
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:57,734
I ruin the true truth
with facts?

342
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,668
Yeah, and you ruin it
for the squint squad, too,

343
00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:01,833
by making them work
on a case about a guy

344
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,000
who's been sealed up
in a fallout shelter
for 50 years.

345
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:07,200
Okay, how would you like me
to spend my Christmas?

346
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:11,134
Christmas is the perfect time
to reexamine your standing

347
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,900
with, you know...

348
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:16,367
A helicopter pilot?

349
00:14:16,434 --> 00:14:18,634
Oh, right, right.

350
00:14:18,701 --> 00:14:21,967
You can't measure the man
upstairs in a beaker,

351
00:14:22,034 --> 00:14:23,334
so he can't possibly exist.

352
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:25,434
"The man upstairs?"

353
00:14:25,501 --> 00:14:27,567
Mmm. You know, you don't know
if you're sick,

354
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:30,134
but you're more than willing
to take drugs just in case.

355
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,534
Seems to me you could give
the man upstairs

356
00:14:32,601 --> 00:14:34,334
the same benefit
of the doubt

357
00:14:34,401 --> 00:14:36,534
that you do
an invisible fungus.

358
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:51,587
In some cases
of valley fever,

359
00:14:51,654 --> 00:14:53,188
suppurating skin
lesions appear.

360
00:14:53,255 --> 00:14:55,155
Could someone in a position
of responsibility

361
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:57,021
please order Zack
to shut up?

362
00:14:57,088 --> 00:14:58,355
Coffee,
coffee.

363
00:14:58,422 --> 00:15:01,221
Good morning,
Ms. Montenegro.

364
00:15:01,288 --> 00:15:02,988
Where did this
come from?

365
00:15:03,055 --> 00:15:04,854
Uh, hazmat team brought it over
earlier this morning.

366
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:06,521
Very... appetizing.

367
00:15:06,587 --> 00:15:07,754
Are you back with us?

368
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:10,188
Yeah. Think so.

369
00:15:10,255 --> 00:15:12,388
Since we're going to be stuck
together for Christmas,

370
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:13,554
we should make the most
of it.

371
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,121
How?

372
00:15:15,188 --> 00:15:17,688
We'll decorate this place
and exchange handmade gifts.

373
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:19,155
An excellent idea,
Ms. Montenegro.

374
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:20,355
I can get behind that.

375
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:21,422
I'm in.
As am I.

376
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:22,955
How about Bones?

377
00:15:23,021 --> 00:15:24,554
Mmm.
Uh-uh.

378
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:26,188
Ah, come on. What's the deal
with Bones and Christmas?

379
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:27,521
Last night,

380
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:29,088
I spun a little story

381
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:32,155
about two young lovers
running off to Paris.

382
00:15:32,221 --> 00:15:34,255
But the man
never shows up,

383
00:15:34,322 --> 00:15:36,021
and the woman is
left wondering what
happened to him.

384
00:15:36,088 --> 00:15:37,754
And I say, "Imagine what
that must have been like."

385
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:40,388
And Brennan says,
"I don't have to."

386
00:15:40,454 --> 00:15:42,955
Yeah, I-I still don't get it.

387
00:15:43,021 --> 00:15:44,788
Oh, my God.

388
00:15:44,854 --> 00:15:45,888
What?

389
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:47,121
Brennan's parents disappeared

390
00:15:47,188 --> 00:15:48,554
just before Christmas

391
00:15:48,621 --> 00:15:50,422
when she was 15.

392
00:15:50,487 --> 00:15:51,955
And she never knew
what happened to them.

393
00:15:52,021 --> 00:15:54,021
Oh, God. That explains a lot.

394
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:55,955
Yeah.
All right.

395
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,788
We need a way to choose
our Secret Santas.

396
00:15:57,854 --> 00:15:59,188
I could build
a random generator.

397
00:15:59,255 --> 00:16:00,888
Wouldn't it be better to match

398
00:16:00,955 --> 00:16:02,688
complimentary people in
a premeditated manner?

399
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,688
I got five numbers in my
head and five letters.

400
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:06,388
You tell me the number, I tell
you the matching letter.

401
00:16:06,454 --> 00:16:07,587
GOODMAN:
Well, are the letters
sequential,

402
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:08,454
or the numbers sequential?

403
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:11,955
Six.
There's no six.

404
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:15,322
"A" through "E"
and one through five?

405
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:16,788
Just pick a name,

406
00:16:16,854 --> 00:16:18,454
and if you get your own,
put it back in.

407
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:19,854
Oh. that could work.

408
00:16:19,921 --> 00:16:22,688
Yeah.
That's good.

409
00:16:22,754 --> 00:16:24,121
Feds seized the house
from a man

410
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:25,355
named Gil Atkins
in the '60s.

411
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:26,921
Proceeds of crime
from fencing,

412
00:16:26,988 --> 00:16:28,621
dealing in jewels,
stolen art.

413
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,688
Atkins built
a fallout shelter in '51.

414
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:32,821
He sealed it in '58
and he died in '83.

415
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:34,521
What do you got?

416
00:16:34,587 --> 00:16:36,454
Ah, nothing much special
about our victim.

417
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:38,322
You know about the toupee?

418
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:40,255
Below average height,
below average weight.

419
00:16:40,322 --> 00:16:41,654
A little frail.

420
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:42,754
Had a bad back.

421
00:16:42,821 --> 00:16:43,854
He had a hunch,

422
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:45,021
maybe from paperwork.

423
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,721
So basically a wimp.

424
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:48,288
Contents of his pockets.

425
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:50,322
Oh, compass, pen knife,
some change.

426
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:52,422
Listen, I got Goodman
for this Secret Santa thing

427
00:16:52,487 --> 00:16:54,155
and I don't know what...

428
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,955
Anthropologically speaking,
gifts are a way

429
00:16:56,021 --> 00:16:56,921
of asserting dominance
in a group.

430
00:16:56,988 --> 00:16:58,988
Now, imagine
an entire holiday

431
00:16:59,055 --> 00:17:00,554
devoted to self promotion,

432
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:02,088
especially in this
materialistic culture.

433
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,487
How can you expect me
to get behind that?

434
00:17:03,554 --> 00:17:05,088
How can you get behind it?

435
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:07,088
Wow. That's deep.

436
00:17:07,155 --> 00:17:09,355
That's a very deep
pile of crap.

437
00:17:09,422 --> 00:17:12,688
You came to me with information
this morning, a peace offering,

438
00:17:12,754 --> 00:17:13,988
but it was to make
you feel better, not me.

439
00:17:14,055 --> 00:17:15,422
Proves my point.

440
00:17:15,487 --> 00:17:16,988
Any idea what this is?

441
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:19,921
No.

442
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:20,988
Me neither.

443
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:22,621
Try Dr. Goodman.

444
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:25,021
You know, Bones, you make it
very, very hard

445
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:26,587
for me to be
nice to you.

446
00:17:28,322 --> 00:17:30,688
We have to be
extremely creative.

447
00:17:30,754 --> 00:17:32,454
Maybe string a bunch
of test tubes together,

448
00:17:32,521 --> 00:17:33,654
fill them with
luminescent liquids.

449
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:35,388
Nice.
Very festive.

450
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,121
They'll probably
give us cancer.

451
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:38,587
That would be fitting
this Christmas.

452
00:17:38,654 --> 00:17:39,621
Tidings
of joy, gentlemen.

453
00:17:39,688 --> 00:17:41,055
Tidings of joy.

454
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:42,754
Decorations do not
a Christmas make.

455
00:17:42,821 --> 00:17:44,454
Family and friends
make Christmas.

456
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,521
We're friends.

457
00:17:47,221 --> 00:17:49,721
Or not friends.

458
00:17:49,788 --> 00:17:52,055
We are colleagues, friends,
coworkers, yes,

459
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:54,521
but for a father like myself,
like Agent Booth,

460
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:56,521
a few glowing test tubes
don't make up

461
00:17:56,587 --> 00:17:58,021
for missing Christmas
morning with the children.

462
00:17:58,088 --> 00:17:59,155
Excuse me?

463
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:00,288
Be kind. Rewind.

464
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:01,754
Booth has a kid?

465
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:05,521
Ah. Well. Not common knowledge,
I gather.

466
00:18:07,688 --> 00:18:10,422
I, uh... see
you've decided

467
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:12,155
to help Dr. Brennan
with the case.

468
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:15,721
Oh. You know, if Angela's right,
sure. Why not?

469
00:18:15,788 --> 00:18:19,055
And... something for Bones.

470
00:18:19,121 --> 00:18:21,021
Call it Christmas spirit.

471
00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:22,721
My thoughts exactly.

472
00:18:22,788 --> 00:18:25,788
Um... I thought I might

473
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,155
take a look at
the contents of
the suitcase with you.

474
00:18:28,221 --> 00:18:30,021
Why?

475
00:18:30,088 --> 00:18:32,388
It beats cobbling together
Christmas decorations

476
00:18:32,454 --> 00:18:34,422
out of pipettes
and graduated cylinders.

477
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:36,921
No, I mean, what makes you
qualified to look at clues?

478
00:18:36,988 --> 00:18:38,688
Well, I'm an archaeologist.

479
00:18:38,754 --> 00:18:40,487
I-I'm good with artifacts.

480
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:41,688
Do you mind?

481
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,854
No. Archaeologist?

482
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:45,754
I thought you were
an administrator.

483
00:18:45,821 --> 00:18:47,021
Yeah, didn't start out
that way.

484
00:18:47,088 --> 00:18:49,854
He was fastidious.

485
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,088
Everything neatly folded

486
00:18:51,155 --> 00:18:54,754
as though by a trained valet.

487
00:18:54,821 --> 00:18:57,021
This man was
by no means wealthy.

488
00:18:57,088 --> 00:18:58,255
All the clothing

489
00:18:58,322 --> 00:19:00,721
is well used and mended.

490
00:19:00,788 --> 00:19:02,055
See that? "Blackman and Ball,
Fine Tailors.

491
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:03,955
Washington, D.C."

492
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:05,255
Rest of his clothes
are all labeled

493
00:19:05,322 --> 00:19:06,487
from Tulsa, Oklahoma.

494
00:19:06,554 --> 00:19:07,654
Huh.

495
00:19:09,454 --> 00:19:10,554
Female handwriting.

496
00:19:10,621 --> 00:19:12,121
How'd you get that?

497
00:19:12,188 --> 00:19:14,088
After cuneiform,
handwriting is a snap.

498
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:16,621
"Dearest Lionel..."

499
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,554
No envelopes,
no return address.

500
00:19:18,621 --> 00:19:20,487
No signature, either.
Just this drawing of a leaf.

501
00:19:20,554 --> 00:19:23,788
They seem to be dated from
summer of 1957

502
00:19:23,854 --> 00:19:27,355
through to early winter
of 1958.

503
00:19:27,422 --> 00:19:28,554
With your permission,
I'll read these.

504
00:19:28,621 --> 00:19:29,587
Yeah.

505
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:31,821
Bones thought you
might know

506
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:32,854
what this is here.

507
00:19:36,821 --> 00:19:39,121
Oh. Hey, Rebecca.

508
00:19:39,188 --> 00:19:41,654
Yeah, thanks for calling.

509
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:43,688
You heard what happened, right?

510
00:19:43,754 --> 00:19:45,721
Seems to be some kind
of a pouch.

511
00:19:45,788 --> 00:19:47,188
You don't have to see me.

512
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:49,288
Sid agreed to bring him by.

513
00:19:50,688 --> 00:19:53,188
Don't make me beg.

514
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,454
Thank you.

515
00:20:00,521 --> 00:20:01,621
Everything all right?

516
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:02,721
Yeah.

517
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:10,554
Puparia show Lionel
had Valley Fever.

518
00:20:10,621 --> 00:20:12,388
We sort of knew that.

519
00:20:12,454 --> 00:20:13,487
Wow. Was that a shot?

520
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:15,155
Because I apologized.

521
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:17,255
I mean, Goodman doesn't
get to see his family.

522
00:20:17,322 --> 00:20:18,921
Zack doesn't get
to see his kids.

523
00:20:18,988 --> 00:20:20,654
Booth doesn't get
to see his son.

524
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,422
At least I'm
an accidental Grinch.

525
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:23,921
All due respect, you're
the Grinch on purpose.

526
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:25,487
I have no idea
what you're saying to me.

527
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:27,188
The Grinch is the relatively
well-known creation

528
00:20:27,255 --> 00:20:28,688
of a children's author
named Dr. Seuss.

529
00:20:28,754 --> 00:20:30,587
Listen, I got Angela
for my Secret Santa thing,

530
00:20:30,654 --> 00:20:33,454
and what I want to do
is blow up a microscopic image

531
00:20:33,521 --> 00:20:35,255
of a toxic mold--
Stachybotrys chartarum--

532
00:20:35,322 --> 00:20:36,088
because I know she's
very interested

533
00:20:36,155 --> 00:20:37,721
in fractal imagery.

534
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:40,088
I thought that might appeal
to her aesthetically.

535
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,322
Do you agree?
I'm not really who you want
to talk to about gifts.

536
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:43,487
Wait. Booth has a kid?

537
00:20:43,554 --> 00:20:45,055
You didn't know?
No.

538
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:46,388
I wasn't the one
who told you.

539
00:20:48,521 --> 00:20:49,587
Fall, 1958.

540
00:20:49,654 --> 00:20:50,988
Heavy weight suit.

541
00:20:51,055 --> 00:20:53,487
Kind of small,
wool, black.

542
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:55,754
First name, Lionel.
That's all I got.

543
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,521
Thanks. I appreciate it.

544
00:20:57,587 --> 00:21:00,454
You know, it being Christmas Eve
and all, I'll hold.

545
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:03,121
Lionel had a suit here
made in town.

546
00:21:03,188 --> 00:21:04,688
The tailor shop,
it still exists.

547
00:21:04,754 --> 00:21:06,021
His grandson owns it.

548
00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:07,721
Get this-- they kept
the records.

549
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:09,121
We may be able to find
Careful Lionel's last name.

550
00:21:09,188 --> 00:21:10,255
"Careful Lionel?"

551
00:21:10,322 --> 00:21:11,955
Yeah. Little guy, toupee.

552
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,721
Drank a vitamin tonic.

553
00:21:13,788 --> 00:21:15,521
Carried his own compass,
all of this stuff just so.

554
00:21:15,587 --> 00:21:17,621
Careful Lionel.

555
00:21:17,688 --> 00:21:19,587
What was he so worried about?
Well, considering
how he ended up...

556
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,554
Wait, you have a son?

557
00:21:21,621 --> 00:21:22,854
Yeah.

558
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:25,121
You've never mentioned that.

559
00:21:25,188 --> 00:21:26,587
Well, nothing brings
people together

560
00:21:26,654 --> 00:21:27,955
like a Christmas lung fungus.

561
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:30,055
Yes. That's great!

562
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:31,255
When?

563
00:21:31,322 --> 00:21:32,955
Great. Thank you.
Merry Christmas.

564
00:21:33,021 --> 00:21:34,255
Lionel Little.

565
00:21:34,322 --> 00:21:35,788
Okay, he picked up
his new suit

566
00:21:35,854 --> 00:21:38,487
on November 7, 1958.
He paid cash.

567
00:21:38,554 --> 00:21:41,021
He was supposed to come
back the next day

568
00:21:41,088 --> 00:21:43,422
for his shirt, but get this:
he never showed up.

569
00:21:43,487 --> 00:21:45,422
It was his wedding shirt.

570
00:21:46,621 --> 00:21:49,121
Whoa! Bless you.

571
00:21:49,188 --> 00:21:50,888
Uh-oh.

572
00:21:50,955 --> 00:21:52,754
Is that a cold,
or Valley Fever?

573
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:55,821
Bones...?

574
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:05,355
So... so, if Lionel was a coin
collector, that might explain

575
00:22:05,421 --> 00:22:08,355
the levels of lead
and nickel in his bones.

576
00:22:08,421 --> 00:22:10,255
When do they
insert the needle
into your brain?

577
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:11,854
I sneezed because
the air is dry.

578
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:13,954
It's not valley fever.

579
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:16,688
Any other symptoms?
Headache?

580
00:22:16,754 --> 00:22:19,188
Any foul-smelling
pustules on your shins?

581
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,921
Look, she sneezed twice,
that's it.

582
00:22:20,988 --> 00:22:22,722
You find anything else
about the letters?

583
00:22:22,787 --> 00:22:24,388
GOODMAN:
Quite a lot, yes.

584
00:22:24,455 --> 00:22:26,688
They are very, very passionate
love letters.

585
00:22:26,754 --> 00:22:28,722
Careful Lionel
had a girlfriend?

586
00:22:28,787 --> 00:22:30,787
A girlfriend who
was in trouble.
Pregnant in trouble?

587
00:22:30,854 --> 00:22:33,255
Whoa. Apparently, Careful
Lionel wasn't so careful.

588
00:22:33,321 --> 00:22:34,988
BOOTH:
An unmarried pregnant girl?

589
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:37,421
In Oklahoma?
In the late '50s?

590
00:22:37,488 --> 00:22:40,021
Do you suppose Lionel came up
here to procure an abortion?

591
00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:41,954
You know what? This isn't a
very Christmas-Eve-type story.

592
00:22:42,021 --> 00:22:43,188
BRENNAN:
Of course it is.

593
00:22:43,255 --> 00:22:44,388
The Christ myth is built upon

594
00:22:44,455 --> 00:22:46,455
the travails
of an unwed mother.

595
00:22:46,521 --> 00:22:48,887
Okay, can we just stop
bringing up the whole
"Christ Myth" thing?

596
00:22:48,954 --> 00:22:50,921
All right, some people believe
it's more than just a myth.

597
00:22:50,988 --> 00:22:52,655
Well, who besides you?

598
00:22:52,722 --> 00:22:53,954
GOODMAN:
That would be me,
Dr. Brennan.

599
00:22:54,021 --> 00:22:54,988
I'm a deacon at my church.

600
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:56,255
ANGELA:
I do.

601
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:58,054
Christmas and
Easter, anyway.

602
00:22:58,121 --> 00:22:59,854
Although I believe organized
religion is just another

603
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,154
political movement designed
to control the masses,

604
00:23:02,221 --> 00:23:04,154
it doesn't mean
God doesn't love me.

605
00:23:04,221 --> 00:23:08,054
Hey, I'm a rational empiricist
all the way.

606
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:09,588
Unless you talk
to my mother,

607
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:12,288
then I'm Lutheran.

608
00:23:13,854 --> 00:23:16,088
I can understand why
you'd be sensitive, Booth.

609
00:23:16,154 --> 00:23:18,388
You have a child
out of wedlock.

610
00:23:18,455 --> 00:23:19,521
Sweetie.

611
00:23:19,588 --> 00:23:21,088
What?

612
00:23:21,154 --> 00:23:23,688
GOODMAN:
Um, the letters display
a combination

613
00:23:23,754 --> 00:23:26,021
of both block
and cursive.

614
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:28,421
A combination
of printing
and writing?

615
00:23:28,488 --> 00:23:30,321
GOODMAN:
It would indicate she
may have left school

616
00:23:30,388 --> 00:23:31,688
some time in the
second grade.

617
00:23:31,754 --> 00:23:33,622
Most white children
in those days

618
00:23:33,688 --> 00:23:35,421
would attain at least
an eighth grade education.

619
00:23:35,488 --> 00:23:36,821
She was African-American?

620
00:23:36,887 --> 00:23:38,854
Why, I believe so, yes.

621
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:40,655
Is there any way Lionel
was African-American?

622
00:23:40,722 --> 00:23:43,054
No, no, he's
definitely Caucasian.

623
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,722
ANGELA:
A white man
and a pregnant

624
00:23:44,787 --> 00:23:47,221
black girl in 1958 Oklahoma?

625
00:23:47,288 --> 00:23:48,421
That was bad?

626
00:23:48,488 --> 00:23:49,455
It was illegal.

627
00:23:49,521 --> 00:23:51,088
In Oklahoma?

628
00:23:51,154 --> 00:23:52,388
Not just Oklahoma, here in D.C.

629
00:23:52,455 --> 00:23:53,588
Then why come here?

630
00:23:53,655 --> 00:23:55,154
They were running away.

631
00:23:55,221 --> 00:23:56,854
BOOTH:
Lionel had two
tickets to Paris.

632
00:23:56,921 --> 00:23:58,221
Where else in 1958
could a white man

633
00:23:58,288 --> 00:23:59,555
and a black woman

634
00:23:59,622 --> 00:24:01,321
get married and live together?

635
00:24:01,388 --> 00:24:03,488
HAL:
Visiting hours, folks.

636
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:04,887
Who's first?

637
00:24:04,954 --> 00:24:06,622
Well, as director
of this institution,

638
00:24:06,688 --> 00:24:07,887
I claim that right.

639
00:24:07,954 --> 00:24:09,388
Okay, brief
announcement.

640
00:24:09,455 --> 00:24:11,154
You guys might recognize my dad,

641
00:24:11,221 --> 00:24:12,821
but I don't really want
to talk about it.

642
00:24:12,887 --> 00:24:14,455
So, thanks.

643
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:15,821
Okay. Let's go.

644
00:24:32,787 --> 00:24:42,288
* Have yourself
a merry little Christmas *

645
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:50,355
* Let your heart be light *

646
00:24:50,421 --> 00:25:00,388
* From now on our troubles
will be out of sight *

647
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:14,622
* Have yourself
a merry little Christmas *

648
00:25:14,688 --> 00:25:22,722
* Make the Yuletide gay *

649
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:35,121
* From now on our troubles
will be miles away *

650
00:25:35,188 --> 00:25:43,555
* Here we are as in olden days *

651
00:25:43,622 --> 00:25:50,555
* Happy golden days of yore *

652
00:25:50,622 --> 00:25:56,954
* Faithful friends
who are dear to us *

653
00:25:57,021 --> 00:26:07,622
* Gather near to us once more *

654
00:26:07,688 --> 00:26:15,588
* Through the years
we all will be together *

655
00:26:15,655 --> 00:26:24,555
* If the fates allow *

656
00:26:24,622 --> 00:26:36,555
* Hang a shining star
upon the highest bough *

657
00:26:36,622 --> 00:26:41,521
* And have yourself... *

658
00:26:41,588 --> 00:26:43,088
You like it?

659
00:26:43,154 --> 00:26:44,521
It's very beautiful.

660
00:26:44,588 --> 00:26:46,154
It's not done yet.

661
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:50,787
We can put our presents
under there, and we can...

662
00:26:50,854 --> 00:26:52,421
You think it's stupid.

663
00:26:52,488 --> 00:26:53,988
No, Ange.

664
00:26:56,821 --> 00:27:00,321
What were your
Christmas plans?

665
00:27:00,388 --> 00:27:03,722
My Dad and I get together
somewhere quiet,

666
00:27:03,787 --> 00:27:05,255
exchange gifts,

667
00:27:05,321 --> 00:27:07,288
just the two of us.

668
00:27:07,355 --> 00:27:10,321
Since I was a kid, getting
some time alone with my Dad

669
00:27:10,388 --> 00:27:11,988
was always difficult.

670
00:27:12,054 --> 00:27:17,288
So what is it with
you and gifts anyway?

671
00:27:17,355 --> 00:27:21,321
I know your parents disappeared
just before Christmas.

672
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:30,421
My brother, Russ, was 19,

673
00:27:30,488 --> 00:27:31,988
and we were still in the house.

674
00:27:32,054 --> 00:27:34,355
That must have been strange.

675
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:39,921
Russ found our presents
in my parents' room

676
00:27:39,988 --> 00:27:42,288
and Christmas Eve,
when I was asleep.

677
00:27:42,355 --> 00:27:43,821
He snuck down

678
00:27:43,887 --> 00:27:45,288
and made Christmas,

679
00:27:45,355 --> 00:27:46,954
trying to do the
right thing for me.

680
00:27:47,021 --> 00:27:49,088
Christmas for his little sister.

681
00:27:51,722 --> 00:27:56,688
But when I came down and saw
the lights and the presents...

682
00:27:56,754 --> 00:27:58,521
You thought your
parents were back.

683
00:27:58,588 --> 00:28:02,255
I just expected
to see them sitting there

684
00:28:02,321 --> 00:28:05,854
drinking their coffee, watching
Russ and me open our presents.

685
00:28:05,921 --> 00:28:07,555
Oh, my God.

686
00:28:07,622 --> 00:28:10,188
I kind of lost it.

687
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:13,821
I refused to open the presents
until they came back.

688
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:20,854
It was like I told Russ
he wasn't enough family for me.

689
00:28:20,921 --> 00:28:22,588
Before New Year's,

690
00:28:22,655 --> 00:28:27,787
he went out West to work and...

691
00:28:27,854 --> 00:28:30,455
I was in the foster system.

692
00:28:31,954 --> 00:28:33,588
BOOTH:
Excuse me.

693
00:28:33,655 --> 00:28:35,455
We have Lionel's missing
person's file.

694
00:28:39,921 --> 00:28:44,255
The tree is really,
really beautiful, Ange.

695
00:28:45,655 --> 00:28:46,954
Really.

696
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:55,154
BOOTH:
Lionel Little, born May 19,
1934, Tulsa, Oklahoma.

697
00:28:55,221 --> 00:28:56,787
GOODMAN:
24 years old.

698
00:28:56,854 --> 00:28:58,688
BRENNAN:
Fits the remains.

699
00:28:58,754 --> 00:29:00,321
BOOTH:
According to the missing
person's report,

700
00:29:00,388 --> 00:29:02,321
lodged by his boss
in January of 1960,

701
00:29:02,388 --> 00:29:04,355
Lionel Little worked
as a lease inspector

702
00:29:04,421 --> 00:29:06,754
for Silver Cloud Petroleum
out of Tulsa, Oklahoma.

703
00:29:06,821 --> 00:29:08,188
Basically
an accountant.

704
00:29:08,255 --> 00:29:09,722
Yeah. You know what,
you were right

705
00:29:09,787 --> 00:29:11,154
about Lionel's coin collection.

706
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:12,787
When Lionel vanished,

707
00:29:12,854 --> 00:29:14,787
so did most of his extensive
coin collection.

708
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:16,421
That was attached
to the file.

709
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,255
Did the coins
ever show up?

710
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:19,488
Yeah. Through D.C, Maryland,
Virginia, Pennsylvania.

711
00:29:19,555 --> 00:29:21,188
The sales were traced

712
00:29:21,255 --> 00:29:22,722
to Gil Atkins.

713
00:29:22,821 --> 00:29:26,355
Yeah, she made about $8,000
selling those coins.

714
00:29:26,421 --> 00:29:28,321
Atkins killed Lionel
for a coin collection?

715
00:29:28,388 --> 00:29:32,321
$8,000 in 1958 translates
to roughly $64,000.

716
00:29:32,388 --> 00:29:35,722
BOOTH:
Careful Lionel gets
a young black girl pregnant.

717
00:29:35,787 --> 00:29:37,555
He sells his coin collection

718
00:29:37,622 --> 00:29:40,355
so he can move them to Paris
and they can live together.

719
00:29:40,421 --> 00:29:42,655
Hmm, he offers the coins
for sale to Atkins,

720
00:29:42,722 --> 00:29:44,455
who figures
it'll be easier to kill

721
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:46,555
the country bumpkin
and steal the coins.

722
00:29:46,622 --> 00:29:49,688
Oh, also, um,
the last person to see Lionel

723
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:53,154
was the woman who cleaned
his office, Ivy Gillespie.

724
00:29:53,221 --> 00:29:55,188
GOODMAN:
What's the significance
of that?

725
00:29:55,255 --> 00:29:57,455
Does, uh, does this look
like an ivy leaf to you?

726
00:29:59,154 --> 00:30:00,321
GOODMAN:
Ivy Gillespie.

727
00:30:00,388 --> 00:30:02,455
Race: Negro.

728
00:30:02,521 --> 00:30:04,088
Oh, my God.

729
00:30:04,154 --> 00:30:05,088
ANGELA:
You have to
find her.

730
00:30:06,655 --> 00:30:08,188
Ivy.

731
00:30:08,255 --> 00:30:10,188
Ivy Gillespie may not
even be alive.

732
00:30:10,255 --> 00:30:12,121
And if she is, this could be
a reminder of an extremely

733
00:30:12,188 --> 00:30:13,255
painful time
of her life.

734
00:30:13,321 --> 00:30:15,421
What would we accomplish?

735
00:30:15,488 --> 00:30:17,054
You have to find the girl
and tell her what you know.

736
00:30:17,121 --> 00:30:18,588
Don't you see?

737
00:30:18,655 --> 00:30:21,821
You can give her the answer
that you never got.

738
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:23,887
Angela.

739
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:25,154
I'm sorry, sweetie,
but it's true.

740
00:30:25,221 --> 00:30:26,821
You have a chance here.

741
00:30:26,887 --> 00:30:30,221
 To say what?
"Merry Christmas,
Ivy Gillespie.

742
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:32,321
"Your fianc?was murdered

743
00:30:32,388 --> 00:30:34,088
"and your life
was ruined, but hey,

744
00:30:34,154 --> 00:30:36,088
at least you get
to know what happened to him."

745
00:30:36,154 --> 00:30:38,088
Don't you wish somebody
had said that to you?

746
00:30:53,754 --> 00:30:55,788
 <i>I realize it's Christmas Eve,</i>

747
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:59,222
but it's extremely important
that I find Ms. Ivy Gillespie.

748
00:30:59,288 --> 00:31:01,421
 <i>We know that she was</i>
 <i>a cleaning lady</i>

749
00:31:01,487 --> 00:31:05,688
 <i>at the Silver Cloud Petroleum</i>
 <i>in 1958 and 1959.</i>

750
00:31:05,754 --> 00:31:07,821
After that, we don't know.

751
00:31:07,888 --> 00:31:09,988
BRENNAN:
 <i>I wouldn't interrupt</i>
 <i>your Christmas,</i>

752
00:31:10,055 --> 00:31:12,621
 <i>except this is very, very</i>
 <i>important to a friend of mine.</i>

753
00:31:12,688 --> 00:31:14,988
I don't want to take time
from your family,

754
00:31:15,055 --> 00:31:17,821
 <i>but I have extremely important</i>
 <i>news for Ms. Gillespie</i>

755
00:31:17,888 --> 00:31:19,387
 <i>regarding a loved one.</i>

756
00:31:19,454 --> 00:31:22,788
Do you have an address
or a place of work

757
00:31:22,855 --> 00:31:25,088
 <i>or... anything?</i>

758
00:31:25,155 --> 00:31:27,654
 <i>I've made dozens of calls</i>
 <i>this evening in an effort</i>

759
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:28,821
 <i>to track this woman down,</i>

760
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:30,588
and it's that important.

761
00:31:33,421 --> 00:31:35,255
Assisted living?

762
00:31:35,322 --> 00:31:37,821
 <i>Is her last name</i>
 <i>still Gillespie?</i>

763
00:31:37,888 --> 00:31:42,055
 <i>Yes, yes. Merry Christmas</i>
 <i>to you, too.</i>

764
00:31:42,121 --> 00:31:43,588
Hello.

765
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:45,955
Yes, I was wondering
if you could tell me

766
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:50,354
if you have any guests
there, first name Ivy,

767
00:31:50,421 --> 00:31:53,322
born January 21, 1934?

768
00:31:53,387 --> 00:31:55,088
She'd be African-American.

769
00:31:56,788 --> 00:31:58,255
Yes, I apologize.

770
00:31:58,322 --> 00:32:01,088
I should have started
with "Merry Christmas."

771
00:32:01,155 --> 00:32:03,121
BRENNAN:
Date of birth

772
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:06,454
is January 21, 1934.

773
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:08,754
She's African-American.

774
00:32:08,821 --> 00:32:10,754
Yes, Ivy.

775
00:32:10,821 --> 00:32:12,621
Her name is still
Gillespie.

776
00:32:12,688 --> 00:32:14,754
Yes, if her granddaughter
is right there.

777
00:32:14,821 --> 00:32:18,055
Yes, hello,
I'm Dr. Temperance Brennan

778
00:32:18,121 --> 00:32:21,588
from the Jeffersonian
Institution in D.C.

779
00:32:21,654 --> 00:32:23,788
I have information that
might be very interesting

780
00:32:23,855 --> 00:32:25,421
to your grandmother.

781
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:29,055
I can be reached
through the Medico Legal Lab

782
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:30,821
here at the Jeffersonian.

783
00:32:30,888 --> 00:32:32,754
And tell her Merry Christmas.

784
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:37,255
You found Ivy Gillespie.

785
00:32:39,354 --> 00:32:42,688
In an assisted-living facility
near Bethesda.

786
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:44,588
I spoke to her granddaughter.

787
00:32:44,654 --> 00:32:46,354
Thank you.

788
00:32:49,021 --> 00:32:50,855
She might not get in touch
with us.

789
00:32:50,921 --> 00:32:52,021
She will.

790
00:32:53,454 --> 00:32:55,454
Because it's Christmas?

791
00:32:55,521 --> 00:32:57,788
Yes.

792
00:33:16,155 --> 00:33:18,121
Did you find something?

793
00:33:18,188 --> 00:33:20,421
Two things that fit together.

794
00:33:20,487 --> 00:33:23,421
Angela sent me.
She says it's Christmas.

795
00:33:23,487 --> 00:33:26,588
Okay.
You still think there's more
to learn about Lionel Little

796
00:33:26,654 --> 00:33:27,821
and Ivy Gillespie?

797
00:33:27,888 --> 00:33:30,188
There's always more to learn.

798
00:33:30,255 --> 00:33:32,188
Hey.

799
00:33:32,255 --> 00:33:34,387
I'm sorry you didn't get
Christmas morning

800
00:33:34,454 --> 00:33:35,955
with your little boy.

801
00:33:37,754 --> 00:33:39,322
Thanks.

802
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:51,121
Good.

803
00:33:51,188 --> 00:33:53,454
Okay, everybody...

804
00:33:53,521 --> 00:33:55,688
stand over here.

805
00:33:55,754 --> 00:33:57,421
Close your eyes.

806
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:01,621
Open your eyes.

807
00:34:02,988 --> 00:34:04,155
* Sleigh bells ring *

808
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:07,855
* Are you listening? *
ANGELA:
Merry Christmas.

809
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,754
* In the lane, all is... *

810
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:13,288
Wow!
Well done!

811
00:34:13,354 --> 00:34:14,855
* A beautiful sight *

812
00:34:14,921 --> 00:34:17,155
* We're happy tonight *
Merry Christmas!

813
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:20,788
* Walking in
a winter wonderland *

814
00:34:20,855 --> 00:34:21,988
* Gone away *

815
00:34:22,055 --> 00:34:25,354
* Is the bluebird *

816
00:34:25,421 --> 00:34:27,222
* Here to stay *

817
00:34:27,288 --> 00:34:29,554
* Is a new bird *

818
00:34:29,621 --> 00:34:31,855
* He sings a love song *

819
00:34:31,921 --> 00:34:34,222
* As we go along *

820
00:34:34,288 --> 00:34:37,088
* Walking in
a winter wonderland *

821
00:34:38,754 --> 00:34:42,821
* In the meadow,
we can build a snowman *

822
00:34:42,888 --> 00:34:44,421
* Then pretend that he... *

823
00:34:44,487 --> 00:34:46,188
Oh, my God.

824
00:34:46,255 --> 00:34:48,955
It's beautiful.
What is it?

825
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:51,955
It's prettier
if you don't know the details.

826
00:34:52,021 --> 00:34:54,654
That is beautiful.
Thank you.

827
00:34:54,721 --> 00:34:56,588
* Later on... *

828
00:34:56,654 --> 00:34:57,888
Oh, my.

829
00:34:59,322 --> 00:35:01,521
Very impressive.

830
00:35:02,821 --> 00:35:04,421
You made this?
Yeah.

831
00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:05,621
Thank you.

832
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:07,921
I'm next.

833
00:35:07,988 --> 00:35:08,955
It's from me.

834
00:35:10,322 --> 00:35:12,955
It's my family.

835
00:35:13,021 --> 00:35:14,255
And me.

836
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:16,055
Thank you.
You're welcome.

837
00:35:20,021 --> 00:35:22,255
Scarabaeus sacer.
Sacred scarab.

838
00:35:22,322 --> 00:35:25,387
That is excellently
rendered, sir. Thank you.

839
00:35:25,454 --> 00:35:26,255
You're very welcome.

840
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:31,754
Zack, that's a...

841
00:35:31,821 --> 00:35:33,721
ZACK:
Self-propelled,
non-autonomic unit.

842
00:35:35,121 --> 00:35:35,988
It's a robot.

843
00:35:36,055 --> 00:35:38,288
I thought if we get

844
00:35:38,354 --> 00:35:40,955
out of here in time today,
you could give it to your son.

845
00:35:41,021 --> 00:35:43,188
* We're happy tonight *

846
00:35:43,255 --> 00:35:44,821
* Walking in a... *

847
00:35:44,888 --> 00:35:46,588
Thanks a lot.
You're welcome.

848
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:51,821
* Gone away is the bluebird *

849
00:35:51,888 --> 00:35:54,222
* Here to stay *

850
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:57,521
BOOTH:
Listen, Bones,

851
00:35:58,155 --> 00:35:59,454
here's the thing.

852
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:01,021
What if a gift goes
both ways?

853
00:36:01,088 --> 00:36:02,088
What's wrong with that?

854
00:36:02,155 --> 00:36:03,387
Look at this.

855
00:36:03,454 --> 00:36:04,554
Yeah, it's a penny.

856
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:05,955
It's not just a penny,

857
00:36:06,021 --> 00:36:08,222
it's a 1943 bronze
one-cent piece.

858
00:36:08,288 --> 00:36:10,288
Look, all I'm saying
is that maybe

859
00:36:10,354 --> 00:36:13,155
the real gift is when you accept
something with a little grace.

860
00:36:13,222 --> 00:36:15,855
Over a billion pennies
were minted in 1943,

861
00:36:15,921 --> 00:36:17,554
most of them in steel

862
00:36:17,621 --> 00:36:19,754
to conserve copper
for World War II, but...

863
00:36:19,821 --> 00:36:23,487
a handful were struck
in an old-style bronze planchet.

864
00:36:23,554 --> 00:36:26,754
Only about 12 of them
exist today.

865
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:29,721
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Wow. And this is one of them?

866
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,521
Yes.

867
00:36:31,588 --> 00:36:34,255
Huh. How much is it worth?

868
00:36:34,322 --> 00:36:35,554
Over $100,000.

869
00:36:37,188 --> 00:36:40,554
Lionel never showed
Gil Atkins the best part

870
00:36:40,621 --> 00:36:41,754
of his collection.

871
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:43,521
Atkins murdered him,

872
00:36:43,588 --> 00:36:46,754
and never knew there was a...
fortune in his pocket.

873
00:36:46,821 --> 00:36:48,921
Well, it looks like Careful
Lionel got the last laugh.

874
00:36:48,988 --> 00:36:49,855
GOODMAN:
Ready?

875
00:36:51,621 --> 00:36:53,354
Time for our
test results.

876
00:37:04,888 --> 00:37:08,387
Green. Green.
Uh, is that green as in "go,"

877
00:37:08,454 --> 00:37:10,521
or green as in
"stick a needle in your brain"?

878
00:37:15,188 --> 00:37:16,621
Merry Christmas.

879
00:37:16,688 --> 00:37:17,788
Oh.

880
00:37:27,487 --> 00:37:30,088
Go. Go have Christmas.

881
00:37:30,155 --> 00:37:31,322
Wish your boy

882
00:37:31,387 --> 00:37:33,188
a merry Christmas from me.

883
00:37:33,255 --> 00:37:37,354
I'm at Wong Foo's
if you decide you want company.

884
00:37:42,088 --> 00:37:43,487
Merry Christmas, Bones.

885
00:37:58,821 --> 00:38:00,387
WOMAN:
Excuse me?

886
00:38:07,588 --> 00:38:09,121
Hi.

887
00:38:09,188 --> 00:38:11,021
My name is Lisa Pearce,

888
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:13,021
and this is
my grandmother,
Ivy Gillespie.

889
00:38:14,487 --> 00:38:15,788
Are you Dr. Brennan?

890
00:38:15,855 --> 00:38:18,521
Yes.

891
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:23,222
I gave birth to a half-white
child in Oklahoma in 1960;

892
00:38:23,288 --> 00:38:25,021
Lionel's daughter.

893
00:38:25,088 --> 00:38:26,588
Raised her myself.

894
00:38:26,654 --> 00:38:28,021
No education.

895
00:38:28,088 --> 00:38:32,222
I got her to college.

896
00:38:32,288 --> 00:38:33,821
She died eight years ago.

897
00:38:33,888 --> 00:38:36,454
And Grandma raised me
after that.

898
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:38,188
Her mother
was a nurse

899
00:38:38,255 --> 00:38:40,788
and Lisa's going to be a doctor.

900
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:42,155
Grandma, I can't afford college.

901
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:48,521
So Lionel
was murdered.

902
00:38:48,588 --> 00:38:52,188
In 1959, yes, by a man
named Gil Atkins.

903
00:38:52,255 --> 00:38:55,021
And you can figure that out

904
00:38:55,088 --> 00:38:57,155
all this time later?

905
00:38:57,222 --> 00:38:58,754
He had these.

906
00:39:13,855 --> 00:39:17,888
( <i>voice breaking</i> ):
Tickets to... Paris.

907
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,387
Grandma, isn't that
what he promised you?

908
00:39:20,454 --> 00:39:22,288
A life in France?

909
00:39:22,354 --> 00:39:26,721
I thought the worst of him.

910
00:39:33,088 --> 00:39:35,721
Thank you, Dr. Brennan.

911
00:39:35,788 --> 00:39:38,222
I have something even better.

912
00:39:43,454 --> 00:39:46,387
What could be better?

913
00:39:46,454 --> 00:39:49,654
You've given me back my life.

914
00:39:52,487 --> 00:39:54,721
It's a penny.

915
00:39:54,788 --> 00:39:57,754
There's something you ought
to know about that penny.

916
00:40:05,521 --> 00:40:12,921
* Decorations are all hung
by the fire *

917
00:40:12,988 --> 00:40:16,188
* Everybody's singing... *

918
00:40:16,255 --> 00:40:17,521
Drinks?

919
00:40:17,588 --> 00:40:19,121
Ah, yes.

920
00:40:19,188 --> 00:40:21,121
Christmas spirits, 
well, they come in
many a guise.

921
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:24,055
Cheers. Ah...

922
00:40:25,821 --> 00:40:29,487
Ivy Gillespie came
to the lab after you left

923
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:31,387
with her granddaughter.

924
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,821
Don't you want
to know what happened?

925
00:40:34,888 --> 00:40:37,821
I know what happened.

926
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,387
You told her about
Careful Lionel.

927
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:45,821
You showed her the letters,
the tickets.

928
00:40:45,888 --> 00:40:48,521
She cried,
but you made her happy.

929
00:40:48,588 --> 00:40:50,721
Not to mention
I gave her a penny

930
00:40:50,788 --> 00:40:52,121
worth over a hundred
thousand dollars.

931
00:40:52,188 --> 00:40:55,222
She won't care about that today.

932
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:59,121
You just gave somebody
the best Christmas gift

933
00:40:59,188 --> 00:41:01,121
they could ever get.

934
00:41:02,387 --> 00:41:04,288
Who's the secret Santa now?

935
00:41:04,354 --> 00:41:05,421
Stop.

936
00:41:11,255 --> 00:41:14,554
And that weirdo assistant
of yours just made me

937
00:41:14,621 --> 00:41:18,688
the coolest dad in the world.

938
00:41:18,754 --> 00:41:20,021
Daddy!

939
00:41:20,088 --> 00:41:21,788
Come on!
Daddy!

940
00:41:23,588 --> 00:41:24,855
Hey, look.

941
00:41:24,921 --> 00:41:26,621
Look at this thing.
Can it flip?

942
00:41:26,688 --> 00:41:28,721
How cool. It can flip,
trip, swim,

943
00:41:28,788 --> 00:41:30,821
whatever you want.

944
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,554
( <i>whispers</i> ):
Say "Merry Christmas."

945
00:41:32,621 --> 00:41:33,454
Merry Christmas.

946
00:41:54,621 --> 00:42:03,454
* Have yourself, ooh,
a merry little Christmas *

947
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:10,921
* Let your heart be light *

948
00:42:10,988 --> 00:42:21,754
* From now own, our troubles
will be out of sight *

949
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:36,387
* Through the years
we all will be together *

950
00:42:36,454 --> 00:42:43,721
 * If the fates allow *

951
00:42:43,788 --> 00:42:58,121
* Hang a shining star
upon the highest bough *

952
00:42:58,188 --> 00:43:08,888
* And have yourself
a merry little Christmas *

953
00:43:08,955 --> 00:43:12,788
* Now. *

954
00:43:12,855 --> 00:43:15,521
