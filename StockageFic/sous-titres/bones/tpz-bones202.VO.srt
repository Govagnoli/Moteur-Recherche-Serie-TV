00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:05,570
Cops say the body washed up on the bay.
It could be Carlie Richardson.

2
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:08,300
- And I'm supposed to know who that is?
- Yeah. Disappeared a year ago.

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,833
She was pregnant. Oh, come on, Bones.
You have to get a TV, you know?

4
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:15,278
Oh, hey, or at least just, uh, hey, thumb
through a <i>People</i> at the checkout stand.

5
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,282
Was it in
the <i>Journal of Forensic Anthropology?</i>

6

to renew my subscription.

7

8

I'm reading Ted Gioia's <i>History ofJazz.</i>
Was she mentioned in there?

9
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:27,888
Or maybe in McGee's
<i>Science and Lore of the Kitchen?</i>

10
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,691
Or perhaps I should develop an interest
in the mainstream media's...

11

exploitation of crimes for
their entertainment value.

12
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:36,629
You know, it's amazing, Bones.
You can really be snotty sometimes. [Laughs]

13
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,570
- So, Carlie Richardson?
- Carlie Richardson, newlywed.

14
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,664
Everyone assumed
that she was murdered.

15
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:44,767
Husband was cheating on her. There was
evidence that they had a fight that day.

16
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:48,143
He was covered in scratches. Witnesses said
that they saw him down by the marina.

17
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:51,012
Yeah, but, hey, you know,
without the body, they had to kick him free.

18
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:55,418
Well, if she's been in the water for a year,
the bones will be saturated.

19
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,581
I'll need

Cam's bringing in
everything on the truck.

21
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,626
After a year, there's not gonna be
a lot of flesh for Cam.

22

She runs the place. It's her call.

No, it's all tissue and blood

She doesn't appreciate

It'll be quicker.

I'll find out on my own.

- Are you gonna run a background check on him?
- You have kids and we'll talk.

00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:12,641
<i>lfhe contacts you, call.</i>

158
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,619
Otherwise, you're looking at
obstruction of justice, aiding and abetting...

159
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,713
and I'm sure we could find
a few other charges...

160
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,884
to make it worth the money
you're paying your lawyer.

161
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,729
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>There's another gash on the second rib, right side...</i>

162
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,597
<i>approximately 45 degrees,</i>
<i>left to right.</i>

163
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:34,506
- Why didn't he divorce her?
- Why did they get married in the first place?

164
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,508
It's an antiquated ritual.

165
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,444
Carlie Richardson believed in it,
trusted her husband, and look what happened.

166
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,606
So this is marriage's fault?

167
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:46,049
Committing yourself to one person
isn't in the interest of the species.

168
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,552
I mean, you have multiple partners.

169
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,556
Don't say it like that.
I date.

170
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:55,390
The notion of a committed relationship,
it's fantasy.

171
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:59,864
<i>Look at Booth. Fighting with his ex.</i>
<i>His son caught in the middle.</i>

172
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,957
We make our lives
out of chaos and hope...

173
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,730
and love.

174
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,136
Someday you'll meet somebody.

175
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,766
I don't need anything more
than I have now.

176
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,333
Talk about a fantasy.

177
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:16,814
<i>The skulls are in multiple pieces, but</i>
<i>the damage is from debris in the water.</i>

178
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,975
Then let's start on the stab wounds.

179
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,179
I'd like you to confirm
the type of knife used in each of these.

180
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,815
These all appear to be from the knife that was
missing from the set taken from Richardson's.

181
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,985
Appear? No conclusions
without corroboration.

182
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:32,519
But Dr. Saroyan seems certain
that Richardson...

183
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:35,066
- Seems? You're my grad student. You work for me.
- <i>[Footsteps Approaching]</i>

184
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,433
<i>Remember, Doc. We're building a case here,</i>
<i>not getting our rocks off on research.</i>

185
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,995
Rocks and sediment
are Hodgins's specialty.

186
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:44,042
You're serious?

187
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:48,005
Okay.

188
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,072
Brought your hand back. I found
organic material under the fingernails.

189
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,551
<i>Should match Richardson. And I found</i>
<i>something else I'd like you to look at.</i>

190
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,250
<i>It's here in the lung.</i>
<i>It's a locket.</i>

191
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,316
<i>It must've been around her neck...</i>

192
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:05,194
and melted into the lung
during putrefaction.

193
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:08,062
Before I remove it,
I wanted to see...

194
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,864
if any of your cyborgs could do anything
with the photo paper.

195
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:13,598
There's not enough left.
It's liquefied.

196
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,466
It's probably just another picture
of the lovebirds anyway.

197
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,771
<i>Oh, what's this?</i>

198
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,751
- <i>Oh, no.</i>
- Who's Kenny?

199
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:38,058
I don't know. I don't want to know.
I just want it to be Richardson.

200
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,758
That's right,
because of the drinking and the poker.

201
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,731
Yeah, I know there's
a lot of animals at the zoo.

202
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,535
The monkeys...
The monkeys are Daddy's favorite.

203
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,973
Did you see... They're just like people.
[Imitating Monkey]

204
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,012
Actually, three million
base pairs of the genome...

205
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,516
differ in protein encoding
and other functional areas.

206
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:01,417
- What?
- Genetic differences between chimps and humans.

207
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,955
I'm talking to
a four-year-old, Bones.

208
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,082
Oh. Yeah.

209
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:09,685
You're spending a lot of time with Drew, huh?
Oh, that's great.

210
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:13,323
Okay, you gotta go eat. Okay, go eat.
Make sure... Okay, I love...

211
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,669
- Yeah.
- New boyfriend spending
a lot of time with your son?

212
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,671
Yeah.

213
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,798
So you got any new information
for me, Bones?

214
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,705
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, there's no need.

215
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,711
It must be hard not being able
to see him when you want to.

216
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,077
See, this is information
that I already know, Bones.

217
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:32,777
Why don't you...
Let's say we just discuss the case, hmm?

218
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,047
- Sure.
- Mm-hmm.

219
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:39,182
You know, I'm his father.
You know, Parker knows that.

220
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,058
I mean, that-that's what's important,
not some stupid trip to the zoo.

221
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,359
- No, absolutely.
- Right.

222
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,398
- Yeah.
- Done.

223
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,558
- Of course.
- Boom.

224
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,828
We found this in her lung.

225
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,773
What?

226
00:12:56,842 --> 00:13:00,471
- Her lung?
- It was enveloped during decomp.

227
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:04,915
- "Kenny"?
- Any reference to a Kenny in the case file?

228
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,578
No, but whoever Kenny is
liked her enough to get her a locket.

229
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,587
Maybe Kyle wasn't the only one
who was cheating.

230
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,680
- Opens up a lot of possibilities.
- Yeah.

231
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:16,694
What do you say we just go talk to
Carlie's friends and see if they know who Kenny is?

232
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,696
[Sighs]

233
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:22,431
<i>The four of us got so close</i>
<i>being in the same Lamaze class.</i>

234
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,992
Losing Carlie was
like losing a sister.

235
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,436
<i>It was her idea to start</i>
<i>this baby group.</i>

236
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,440
We all felt so connected.

237
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,272
Feeling someone growing inside,
waiting to meet them.

238
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,711
- Do you have kids?
- He does.

239
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,578
They make you feel whole.

240
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,949
It's just a release of serotonin
necessary for the survival of the species.

241
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,354
- Huh?
- Never mind.
Um, we found this locket on Carlie's remains.

242
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,860
It says, uh, "I love you, Kenny."
Did she ever mention a Kenny?

243
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,624
- Yes.
- She talked about Kenny all the time.

244
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,222
- He was never mentioned in the police report.
- Kenny was her dog.

245
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,234
<i>Her dog?</i>

246
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:59,601
Kyle bought her the dog when things were
better between them. She <i>loved</i> that dog.

247
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,970
<i>There used to be a picture</i>
<i>of them in there.</i>

248
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,373
Well, where is her dog now?

249
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,411
It died.
Mary took care of it.

250
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:10,437
I'm a vet. They brought it in a few months
before Carlie disappeared.

251
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,246
- Kyle said he backed over it accidentally.
- [Fussing]

252
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,719
Carlie always felt
he did it on purpose.

253
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,256
He was a real piece of work
when he got mad.

254
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,688
A dead dog. Excellent.

255
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:27,562
- So we're back to one suspect: Richardson.
- I like this. Good work.

256
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:31,296
- Do you want children?
- What?

257
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,736
Children?

258
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,001
Maybe, if I could find one
that sleeps late and cleans.

259
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,009
Does this apply
to the case in any way?

260
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,011
No, just curious.

261
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,570
Most people think it's odd when
a woman doesn't want children.

262
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,981
But, obviously, you don't.

263
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,781
Are you pregnant?

264
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,618
- No. [Chuckles] I'm not. No.
- Why are you looking at me?

265
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,524
Well, as long as you're not leaving the lab
every two minutes to pee.

266
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,687
No intention of it.

267
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,960
So all this back-and-forth was for nothing?
Good to know.

268
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:05,936
<i>Now, unless the liver has a written confession</i>
<i>in it by a pet parakeet...</i>

269
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:10,203
we should have enough to build a solid forensic
case against Richardson for the prosecutor.

270
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,642
<i>I found something that might</i>
<i>put a new wrinkle in things.</i>

271
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:16,112
- Great.
- Oh, God.

272
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,115
<i>The fish was</i>
<i>a Pomatomus saltatrix...

273
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,117
a bluefish common to Delaware Bay.

274
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:24,747
And there were dinoflagellates consistent
with the salt water in the bay.

275
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,486
- Dozing off, Hodgepodge.
- But I also found <i>Didinium,</i> a ciliate...

276
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,224
<i>and oomycota, a mold,</i>
<i>both of which are found in freshwater.</i>

277
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,961
So the body was in
fresh and salt water.

278
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,230
Exactly. Freshwater first
for at least six months.

279
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,795
Okay, we have witnesses that put
Richardson at the marina that night.

280
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,501
There is no freshwater in that area.

281
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:47,204
- So maybe Richardson didn't do it.
- [Sighs]

282
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,644
[Sighs]

283
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,986
What the hell's going on here?
Richardson's the only logical suspect.

284
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,457
- Are we working for the defense now?
- I'm working for the victims.

285
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,086
We have to be open to the evidence
as it presents itself.

286
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,653
The knife, the rope, the plastic sheeting
are all from Richardson's house.

287
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,529
That's been confirmed.
We're trying to build a case here, people.

288
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,433
Don't ignore facts just because
it might change the outcome of the case.

289
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,903
Not asking you to.
I want you to fill in the blanks.

290
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,635
There must be freshwater close enough
for Richardson to have dumped the body.

291
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,769
It has to have the same sediment,
larvae, archaea, helminths.

292
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,370
Great. Whatever the "hell-minths"
those are, find them.

293
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,906
If we find a body of water that matches,
it has to be dredged for additional parts.

294
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,182
We're still missing the left patella, tibia
and calcaneus. And the fetus...

295
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:32,655
Okay, fine.
Just stop talking and do it.

296
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,421
Hey, so, is this the only
freshwater near the bay?

297
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,862
The only body of water that might
have algae and sediment...

298
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:43,197
that could match what
we found on the remains.

299
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:46,066
<i>Whoo! Seems to be</i>
<i>a lot of Gamophyta.</i>

300
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:49,574
- Is that good?
- I won't know until I compare it
to the samples in the lab.

301
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:52,576
- Then why'd you act so excited?
- I guess I just like Gamophyta.

302
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,839
<i>You know, you really don't</i>
<i>have to act any geekier.</i>

303
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,972
The whole outfit does it for you.

304
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,746
Geek chic, dude.
Agent Blondie over there thinks I'm hot.

305
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,481
- How you doin'?
- [Chuckles]

306
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,119
- Anything?
- Another Top-Flite!

307
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,091
You know, I went out with a woman
who had a little kid once.

308
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,761
- Aren't you supposed to be looking for slime?
- The kid hated me.

309
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,100
- Said I used too many big words.
- He got that right.

310
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:23,835
Hit me in the head with a Tonka truck.
Ah, I could never sleep with his mom again.

311
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,139
Well, you know,
at least the story ends well.

312
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,942
I was good to him though. I did not deserve
an 18-wheeler to the parietal bone.

313
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,142
Ooh! Nematodes and planaria.

314
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,151
<i>Does that mean anything?</i>

315
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,449
- Not sure.
- [Sighs]

316
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,683
Anything?

317
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,987
Bones. Could be from the fetus.

318
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,824
<i>Hamate, triquetral,</i>
<i>portions of the phalanges.</i>

319
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,161
And another Top-Flite!

320
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,029
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Yeah, check to the side.</i>

321
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,829
According to the reconstruction
with these new bones...

322
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,965
the fetus has seven fingers.

323
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,975
And two right hands.

324
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,034
I don't understand.
Was there another victim?

325
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,103
Double the magnification.

326
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:10,850
Okay, look at the structure
of the phalanges.

327
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:15,360
- Ah. The bones from the lake are from a raccoon.
- Mm-hmm.

328
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,919
The formation of the hands
is almost identical to an infant's hand.

329
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:22,296
- How did you do?
- I found a raccoon. You?

330
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,894
Sediment and organic material from the lake
doesn't match what was taken from the remains.

331
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,667
I have to look for another body of freshwater.
I don't think it's around.

332
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,504
- What have you got?
- Nothing.

333
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,307
The next body of freshwater
that might match is over 60 miles away.

334
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:37,041
<i>Richardson couldn't have been there.</i>
<i>It wouldn't match the timeline.</i>

335
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,779
I've got the board of theJeffersonian,
the federal prosecutor and Nancy Grace...

336
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,515
ready to devour me if I don't hand them
enough to indict Richardson.

337
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,489
Well, if you want us
to manufacture evidence...

338
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,491
I want us to find out
who killed Carlie.

339
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,494
I'm pissed 'cause whoever did it
is messing with me, and I don't like that.

340
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,496
I like doing the messing.

341
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:56,022
- <i>Then we have to determine whether</i>
<i>we're wasting our time on Richardson.</i>
- Tell me what you need.

342
00:18:56,368 --> 00:19:01,635
<i>His plates were found in a ditch on Route 432,</i>
<i>his car in a vacant lot in Huntsville.</i>

343
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:04,574
He could be using another car,
or he could be hiding out.

344
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,840
- Anybody I.D. him?
- We've got I.D.'s coming in from all over the place.

345
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,347
This is where the concerned citizens
all come out for the reward.

346
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:13,043
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>
- Excuse us. Agent Booth?

347
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,281
- Let me know if you find something else.
- Sure.

348
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:23,186
I'm Dennis Campbell. This is my wife, Patricia.
We're Carlie's parents.

349
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,958
Yes, I know.
Please, sit down.

350
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,758
I'm so sorry for your loss.

351
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,602
Well, at least now our daughter can rest with
her baby, and Kyle can never touch them again.

352
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:39,201
- The reason we're here...
- We were going through
some photos for the funeral...

353
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,872
and we came across this one.

354
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,211
<i>[Dennis]</i>
<i>Kyle used to go out of town on business.</i>

355
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:47,946
<i>His firm had an office in Boston.</i>
<i>Carlie went with him once.</i>

356
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,454
This is them with
some people in Boston.

357
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:54,583
That woman on the news, Karen Tyler,
she said she met Kyle <i>after</i> Carlie disappeared.

358
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,891
But-But here she is looking at him.

359
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,761
He admitted to being involved
with those other girls.

360
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,959
Why did he lie about knowing her?

361
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,060
- May I keep this photo?
- Of course.

362
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,163
We need them to answer for this.

363
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,607
She was our little girl.

364
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,907
<i>She wasn't supposed to go before us.</i>

365
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,709
That's not the way
it's supposed to be.

366
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:23,018
I know. We'll find Kyle.
I promise.

367
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:34,090
- You want me to what?
- Stab the body for me.

368
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,693
We need to match force with the injuries
recorded on the remains.

369
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,703
Okay, I'm stabbing the body.

370
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,433
Well, it's a replica.
We're all going to do it.

371
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,839
You're just the closest
to Kyle Richardson.

372
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,844
Okay. That's great.
I'll be there in 20.

373
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,176
But in the future, you have to
ask me differently, Bones.

374
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,706
Because you know what? Come over to
your place to stab a body... That is just freaky.

375
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:56,447
- Seeley, you son of a bitch.
- Oh. I... Rebecca. Wow. You look great.

376
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,217
Save it, 'cause I need a lot more
than compliments right now.

377
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,192
Okay. Just keep it down a little bit.
'Cause I'm at work. All right?

378
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,492
You sent agents to investigate Drew?
Because you're gonna stop that now.

379
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,362
Listen. I'm just being cautious.
What do you really know about this guy anyway?

380
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,867
I know... l-l-I know
that he has a good job.

381
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,133
And I know that he fixes stuff
around the house when he says he's going to.

382
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,140
And I know that Parker
is crazy about him...

383
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,336
and he's not terrified every time
he goes to work that he's going to get shot.

384
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,005
And I know that I love him.

385
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,446
I love him.

386
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,507
And now everyone at work
thinks he's a criminal.

387
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,110
- Well, he's been spotted with explosives.
- He is a construction foreman.

388
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:32,384
He does demolition. You must've figured that out
when you were doing all your snooping.

389
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:36,393
I have a right to know who's around my son.
He spends more time with Parker than I do.

390
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,520
Okay, you think that
I would put Parker in danger?

391
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:42,863
Let me ask you a question. Why is it you keep
all the men in your life such a secret?

392
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:47,064
Because you always interrogate them
or intimidate them, and it freaks them out!

393
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,040
A lot are a little strange.
The guy with the tattoos on his neck?

394
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:53,339
[Stammers]
I don't even have to let you see Parker, okay?

395
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:57,246
Not-Not-Not legally. That-That's one
of the upsides of not being married.

396
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,284
Don't.

397
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,683
I'm a good father.
You know that.

398
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,780
You have got to stop
trying to run things.

399
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:09,122
I've got things in my life that
have nothing to do with you.

400
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:13,927
Look. We are always gonna have something
to do with each other because we share a son.

401
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,160
Drew's a good man.

402
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:19,795
And you need to back off, or you're
not gonna see Parker again. I swear.

403
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,937
Back off.

404
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:37,421
- Here comes Kyle.
- Ha, ha. Funny. Don't we have something to stab?

405
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:41,152
- This. I hate my job.
- From the depth of the stab wounds...

406
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:44,161
we can tell the approximate force
required in newton meters...

407
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,163
to inflict the marks
we see on the bones.

408
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:50,133
So we have to measure the amount of force
generated when we stab...

409
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,171
to give us the size, weight
and body type of the assailant.

410
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,172
Mm-hmm. You had to dress her up?

411
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,767
The clothes she wore figure
in the resistance to the blows.

412
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:02,075
The knife is consistent with
the one that caused the wounds.

413
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:04,877
We fitted it with
an instrumented blade...

414
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,783
that will give us a digital readout of
the newton meters of each stab.

415
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:10,344
It's a dual-mass drop system.

416
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,014
All I hear is blah, blah, blah.

417
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,581
<i>CliffsNotes version:</i>
<i>We all stab. One of us is the killer.</i>

418
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,355
- Thank you.
- Sort of like a real creepy party game.

419
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:22,196
The violence of the attack shows rage.
So everyone should stab as hard as they can.

420
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,266
[Grunting]

421
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,967
[Grunting]

422
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,504
This better work!

423
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:42,112
- That was weird.
- [Shuddering]

424
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:47,518
- Okay. Okay. [Chuckles]
- <i>[Booth] Results?</i>

425
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,959
The force used to make
the injuries on the bones...

426
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:54,294
was 24 newton meters.

427
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:58,530
<i>And the winner is,</i>
<i>with 24 newton meters...</i>

428
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:02,369
Angela.

429
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,170
- What?
- <i>[Hodgins] Congratulations.</i>

430
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:06,836
- Really?
- Height and weight?

431
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,403
Oh, God. Uh... Uh...

432
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:13,679
[Sighs] 5'8", 100 and...
[Mutters] hundred.

433
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:17,483
- What?
- 135. It's all muscle.

434
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:22,493
<i>Karen Tyler is 5'7 " and 132 pounds.</i>

435
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,859
[Screaming]

436
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,160
So, Kyle's girlfriend kills Carlie
so they can be together.

437
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:30,065
- Well, then why did Kyle run?
- <i>[Saroyan] Maybe he didn't.</i>

438
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,365
<i>It sounds nuts,</i>
<i>but if she's the killer...</i>

439
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:34,997
maybe Karen got rid of him too
to keep him from talking.

440
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:45,783
Okay, so you're sure there's no way
Richardson could've made these wounds?

441
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:49,048
With his strength, the blows
would've sliced deeper into the bone.

442
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,784
- These seem to go right through.
- <i>Well, those were delivered</i>
<i>after she was on the ground.</i>

443
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:58,319
<i>So Karen does the killing because they know</i>
<i>everyone will be suspecting Kyle.</i>

444
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:01,092
- I'd prefer not to make any more assumptions.
- Oh.

445
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,259
There are particles
in the knife marks.

446
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,769
When she was on the ground,
the knife passed through the body...

447
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,771
and picked up sediment
from the dirt.

448
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,171
The next stab embedded
that into the bone.

449
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,176
If I can get enough information
from these particulates...

450
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,474
I might be able to locate
the site of the murder.

451
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,707
D.N.A. results came back.
It was Kyle under her nails.

452
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,146
- So he was there too.
- Maybe.

453
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:21,151
But we know he had a fight
with her earlier that he admits.

454
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:24,780
Fortunately, there was also the skin
of somebody else. Tests showed it was a woman.

455
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,881
Mmm. Karen Tyler.

456
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:30,450
- We should get her D.N.A. drawn
as soon as possible.
- Smart. Let's go, Bones.

457
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,593
<i>l- I didn't do it. I swear,</i>
<i>I would never hurt her.</i>

458
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,930
The other day you said
you and Kyle didn't know each other...

459
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,833
<i>until</i> after <i>Carlie disappeared.</i>

460
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,633
Because we both knew
what everyone would think.

461
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,434
Karen, please don't say anything.

462
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,975
Hmm. Even your lawyer
thinks you did it.

463
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,341
<i>Kyle thought we should separate</i>
<i>and meet in a few months...</i>

464
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:50,074
so, you know,
it wouldn't look so bad.

465
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:53,083
- Well, that didn't work out now, did it?
- Open your mouth.

466
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,415
Do I really have to do this?

467
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,455
They have a warrant.

468
00:25:57,522 --> 00:26:00,787
When you were sleeping with Kyle, didn't it
matter to you you were destroying a family?

469
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,793
We were in love.

470
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:06,854
Oh. Love. Sorry.
Now it's a beautiful story.

471
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,867
- Open again.
- Ouch.

472
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,426
- Oops.
- <i>Kyle was gonna tell her.</i>

473
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:16,099
- We were gonna be honest.
- Mmm. 'Cause, you know, you do that so well.

474
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,665
I would <i>never</i> hurt her.

475
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,938
And neither would Kyle.

476
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:25,381
Kyle. Right. The love of your life
who no one has seen for two days.

477
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,715
Can you see why
I'm leery of relationships?

478
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,846
<i>[Door Opens, Closes]</i>

479
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:34,016
<i>We hit pay dirt.</i>
<i>Actually, we hit silt...</i>

480
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:37,220
containing the feces of the gypsy moth,
some quartz and mica.

481
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:40,526
That and the zinc levels in
the dinoflagellates from the freshwater...

482
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,433
as well the Pinaceae pollen
led us to a patch of pitch pines...

483
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:47,665
outside of Gloucester City,
New Jersey.

484
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,730
<i>[Angela]</i>
<i>She was killed right here.</i>

485
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:52,572
- Then when did they move her to the bay?
- They didn't.

486
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:57,377
They left her in New Jersey in the Rancocas Creek.
She made it to the bay on her own.

487
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,917
- What, did she take the shuttle?
- <i>Basically.</i>

488
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:03,352
Two days after Carlie disappeared,
there were thunderstorms in New Jersey.

489
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,355
Heavy, heavy rains.

490
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:09,416
The body must have been flushed down
the Rancocas and into the Delaware River.

491
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:14,227
Then she slowly made her way
down the Delaware and into the bay.

492
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,757
The movement and the battering
on the rocks loosened her weight...

493
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:21,203
so she floated to the surface
and washed ashore.

494
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:24,105
I'm pretty sure Karen
didn't see that comin'.

495
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:41,451
- Now, you're sure this is it?
- <i>Zinc, mica, feces. This is the place.</i>

496
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:44,984
- Oh, it's beautiful here.
- Yeah, because, you know,
that's important for a murder.

497
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,088
The bodies were wrapped
on the bank of the river.

498
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,326
- Sift the soil for the missing bones.
- Yes, ma'am.

499
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,029
<i>Agent Booth. Over here.</i>

500
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,234
<i>Look at that... "C.R."</i>
<i>Carlie Richardson's initials.</i>

501
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,211
Ugh.

502
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:11,816
You don't pack face cream and a nightgown
if you're being abducted.

503
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,553
A lot of vacation cabins nearby. If she was upset,
this would be a good place to unwind.

504
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:18,892
Well, Karen Tyler said
that she liked Carlie.

505
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:21,830
She could've befriended her
to lure her up here.

506
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,425
Maybe Carlie's friends knew...

507
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:28,063
that she and Karen
were getting chummy.

508
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:31,768
- Did Carlie know about her?
- I thought they just started going out.

509
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,902
No. They knew each other
from before.

510
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,845
- Bastard.
- Carlie knew Kyle was cheating on her.

511
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:41,682
- That's why they were fighting.
- And why she didn't want the baby.

512
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,085
- Did she say that?
- <i>I don't care what's happening.</i>

513
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:47,022
To say you don't want your child
when you're getting ready to give birth?

514
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,993
- It's not right.
- <i>[Mary] I think I did see this woman.</i>

515
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,291
I was driving home from work.
They were in front of Starbucks.

516
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:55,526
I'm not sure if it was the day she disappeared.
It was around the same time.

517
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,832
- Thanks.
- <i>[Child Wailing]</i>

518
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,833

<i>[Wailing Continues]</i>

520
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:09,105
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>I don't know how they can do it.</i>

521
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,648
They're self-obsessed.
They have no conscience.

522
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,911
- I don't know.
- They destroy anything that gets in their way.

523
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:17,182
- They're not even human.
- The mothers?

524
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,780
- Huh?
- I was talking about the mothers.

525
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,486
- I'm talking about the killers.
- I understand killers.

526
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,020
I just don't know how mothers can do it.
I mean, dogs can be trained in a couple weeks.

527
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,532
With kids, mothers have
to give up their lives for years.

528
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,593
No. When you're looking at your kid,
you don't feel like you're giving up anything.

529
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,160
- So you'd do it again?
- What?

530
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,537
You'd have Parker even with everything
you're going through?

531
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,906
- What kind of question is that?
- Wouldn't it be easier...

532
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:43,471
if Parker wasn't caught in this drama of yours
with Rebecca, the new boyfriend?

533
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:46,039
God, no. No, Bones.
He's my son.

534
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,745
Whatever we're going through,
it's not about that. He knows that.

535
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,414
That's what parents say
when they want to <i>justify</i> themselves.

536
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,957
You know, I haven't walked out on Parker.
All right?

537
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,391
I would never have done
what your parents did.

538
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:00,989
Well, I didn't say you would.
I just... I don't know.

539
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:04,831
You're the father.
I don't know anything about raising kids, so...

540
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,701
Parker's fine.

541
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:11,768
- It's not Karen Tyler.
- What?

542
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,368
The D.N.A. from under
Carlie's fingernails doesn't match.

543
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:16,970
And something else is weird.

544
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:21,144
- Tissue from the fetus shows
evidence of escitalopram.
- What's that?

545
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:24,086
- It's a drug prescribed for depression.
- It's not weird.

546
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,919
Carlie Richardson was having
emotional problems with her husband.

547
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,925
Carlie Richardson
wasn't taking the drug.

548
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,621
- Hold on. None of this is making any sense.
- I agree.

549
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:34,130
The only way the fetus could
have the drug in its system...

550
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,224
is if it were passed
from the mother in utero.

551
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:39,668
- Or through breast milk.
- How do you breast-feed an unborn child?

552
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,762
- Zack?
- Whoa.

553
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,539
An infant's skull is made up
of several separate bones...

554
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:50,069
that are eventually fused together.

555
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,777
- Look at the molding.
- Oh, my God.

556
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,412
- I don't believe it.
- Yeah.

557
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,387
Okay, now everybody knows but me.

558
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,822
This is not a fetus.

559
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:05,955
The skull bones have shifted and overlapped
because this child passed through the birth canal.

560
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:10,990
This baby was born alive
and lived about two weeks.

561
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:13,128
But Carlie was pregnant
when she was last seen.

562
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,695
This isn't
Carlie Richardson's child.

563
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:18,867
The escitalopram in its system
came from breast milk.

564
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,343
- Then what happened to her baby?
- [Baby Crying]

565
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:25,576
<i>The baby was cut out ofher</i>
<i>and stolen.</i>

566
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,117
This child replaced it.

567
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:38,562
This child was dead
before Carlie was murdered.

568
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,599
You can see the traces of blood
pooling in the cranium.

569
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,863
- Abusive head trauma.
- Evidence of shaken baby syndrome.

570
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,870
Oh, God.

571
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:49,133
<i>You said the little guy</i>
<i>was only two weeks old.</i>

572
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:52,665
Whoever the mother was was probably taking
the medication for postpartum depression.

573
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,475
She got upset with the baby.
Crying's the most common cause.

574
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,845
And she shook him to quiet him down.

575
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,182
It can take as little as five seconds
for an infant to die by shaking.

576
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,187
- Five seconds?
- The veins that attach the brain...

577
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,315
to the inside of the skull detach.

578
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:10,384
- <i>Blood pools, the brain swells.</i>
- <i>[Booth] Okay, I get it.</i>

579
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:15,330
So what you're saying is that the mother kills
her own son and replaces him with Carlie's.

580
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,961
Fits the pattern. She feels the guilt at
what she's done and needs to make it right...

581
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,335
prove to herself that
she's still a good mother.

582
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:24,000
So she takes Carlie's child
and makes it her own.

583
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,635
<i>It's only been two weeks.</i>
<i>Not many people have seen her kid.</i>

584
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,645
- <i>Who would know?</i>
- But the stab wounds.

585
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:32,809
<i>All of Carlie's stab wounds are</i>
<i>to the upper part of the body.</i>

586
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:36,684
<i>The killer was careful not</i>
<i>to hit close to the uterus...</i>

587
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:39,245
because she wanted the baby alive.

588
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:42,191
Your report indicates there were
knife marks on the lower ribs.

589
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,252
They seem to be made by
whatever instrument was used...

590
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,798
<i>to remove the child</i>
<i>after Carlie was dead.</i>

591
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:51,562
<i>Yep. I'm working on identifying it.</i>

592
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,995
We might be able to use
the child's...

593
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:58,509
most prominent genetic characteristics
to see similarities with the mother.

594
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:02,945
Ange, can you input the information
from the infant's skull to give us a face?

595
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:06,040
- Sure.
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

596
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:09,917
Booth. Yeah.
Right away.

597
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,082
They've found Kyle Richardson.
[Clears Throat]

598
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:18,087
<i>I wonder ifhe'll even care.</i>
<i>Finding out his wife is dead.</i>

599
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,221
- He didn't kill her.
- No, but he ran.

600
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:23,199
How do you just cut your family
out of your life like that?

601
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:26,896
- Well, what about Abraham?
- What, you're gonna throw religion
in my face right now?

602
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,962
I thought you found answers
in what you believe.

603
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,235
That's just one Bible story
that I just don't like.

604
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,767
I mean, God commands Abraham
to kill his own son, and he does.

605
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:38,304
- No, Abraham does not kill Isaac.
- But old Abe, you know, he had the intention.

606
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,181
- Well, I thought what he had was faith.
- Look, I have faith.

607
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:46,087
But if God himself came down, pointed at Parker
and said, "I want you to, you know"...

608
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:48,148
That ain't gonna happen.

609
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,660
- But God's messenger stopped Abraham?
- Yeah.

610
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:53,959
Grabbed his hand at the last second
right before the knife was about to go in.

611
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,968
- Okay, then the lesson
I would learn from this myth...
- Myth?

612
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,833
- Well, it fits the definition.
- Okay, fine.

613
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:03,499
That when it comes to your children,
your love has to be absolute.

614
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:06,839
The messenger represents goodness,
what you know to be right.

615
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:10,938
Ergo, you have to remain open
to what you know is true.

616
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:14,416
[Chuckles]
Are you sure you're not religious?

617
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:17,283
- Science all the way.
- Science all the way.

618
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:20,756
Hey, even an empiricist
can have a heart, Booth.

619
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:23,692
Too bad Richardson doesn't.

620
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,361
Just lock me up.
I can't go through this anymore.

621
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:30,299
We know you didn't do it.

622
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:33,860
- What?
- Evidence doesn't fit you.

623
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,164
Then who was it?
Who killed them?

624
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,232
You ran. Seems like
you'd be the one who'd know.

625
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,244
I would've told someone if I knew.

626
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,246
Right. 'Cause, you know,
you're such an honorable guy.

627
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,908
The knife, the rope, the sheeting...
It all came from your place...

628
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,315
and why didn't you tell
the police it was missing?

629
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,718
Oh. What, you check out
what's in your garage every day?

630
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:53,018
If you didn't know anything,
why did you take off?

631
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:56,060
Because I'm a bastard.

632
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:59,824
I'm a selfish, pathetic bastard,
and everyone had already decided that I was guilty.

633
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,798
- That's true, Booth.
- Bones.

634
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:06,200
No one wanted to find another suspect.
I kept on insisting.

635
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,636
Thank you.

636
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:10,640
But I didn't do it for you.

637
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,869
You are a pathetic bastard.

638
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,003
Your wife was having your baby.

639
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,242
Look. I did wanna leave her, yeah.

640
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:22,719
I was out that night trying
to figure out how to tell her...

641
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,221
<i>what with the baby and everything.</i>

642
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,224
<i>But for God's sake,</i>
<i>I didn't want them to die.</i>

643
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,260
So you have no idea who did this?

644
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:33,229
I should, shouldn't I?

645
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:40,632
I mean, I ignored her for so long.

646
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,240
It's like this whole thing
is my fault anyway.

647
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:50,445
[Chuckles]
You know, if I had been there that night...

648
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,847
<i>maybe they'd still be here.</i>

649
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:56,444
We think your child
might still be alive.

650
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:01,391
I don't understand.
The bodies you found...

651
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:04,257
That wasn't your child.

652
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:08,697
Whoever killed Carlie
took your child and left theirs.

653
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,167
Oh, my God.

654
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:16,365
Then... So where's my kid?

655
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,366
We don't know.

656
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:25,942
<i>Zack was working on the other knife mark.</i>
<i>I saw staining in the groove it left, so I did tests.</i>

657
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,714
The stain was from Betadine.
It's an antiseptic used to prep patients for surgery.

658
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:32,347
Oh, someone was being really careful
when they were cutting her up.

659
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,357
It was the baby
they were concerned with.

660
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:37,656
Were you able to get enough detail
from the skull for a digital reconstruction?

661
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:41,289
<i>Yeah. Since someone this young</i>
<i>is still being formed...</i>

662
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:45,461
the, uh, features are generalized.

663
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,403
The last place I worked
had a drunk sketch artist.

664
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,274
<i>Wow.</i>

665
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:55,335
It's a baby.
It looks like every baby.

666
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:58,109
That's why I ran the reconstruction
through an aging matrix.

667
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:01,583
<i>It posits the most likely growth</i>
<i>pattern the skull would follow.</i>

668
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:04,849
<i>Now as it ages, the features</i>
<i>become more distinct.</i>

669
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:10,827
<i>By the time he's about 10, he shows</i>
<i>very definite genetic characteristics.</i>

670
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:24,236
Robbie!
Don't eat that, honey.

671
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,333
- [Babbling]
- There you go. There you go.

672
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,243
<i>The mark on the ribs</i>
<i>was from a scalpel.</i>

673
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:33,306
The woman is a vet, so she has medical training,
which also explains the Betadine.

674
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:36,148
Look at her, playing with the kid.

675
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,313
- It's okay. Shh.
- <i>[Booth] Ms. Corbis.</i>

676
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:41,790
- I'm gonna have to ask you to hand us the child.
- What? Why?

677
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:44,123
I think you know why.

678
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:47,494
No. You want me
to give you my son? No.

679
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,999
He's not your son.
We know what happened.

680
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,293
He is. Robbie is my son.

681
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:56,863
We have a warrant to take a D.N.A. sample
from you, Ms. Corbis.

682
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,136
- <i>It'll be pretty hard to argue with that.</i>
- <i>[Robbie Fussing]</i>

683
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,474
Shh.

684
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:04,480
- <i>[Fussing Continues]</i>
- <i>Shh.</i>

685
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,214
She didn't want him.

686
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,245
She told me she wished she had never gotten
pregnant. It was wrong for her to have him.

687
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:15,588
And killing your own child
wasn't wrong?

688
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,060
- That was a mistake!
I am a single mother! I'm alone.
- [Crying]

689
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:21,860
I just... I just wanted him to stop crying!
It was just... It was just a few seconds.

690
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:24,025
<i>[Crying Continues]</i>

691
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:27,229
The doctor said I was sick,
but I'm all better now.

692
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,796
I know, sweetie.
I know, sweetie.

693
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:32,934
- Ms. Corbis.
- You can't take him from me. I'm a good mother.

694
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,376
You can ask anybody.
I'm a good mother.

695
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,505
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

696
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:40,175
Give us the child.

697
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,745
[Crying Continues]

698
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,255
[Kisses, Sobs]

699
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:53,626
- It's all right.
- It's okay.

700
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,758
- It's okay.
- I'm a good mother.

701
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:00,736
Mary Corbis, you're under arrest for
the murder and kidnapping of Carlie Richardson...

702
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,864
<i>and the murder of your son,</i>
<i>Robert Corbis.</i>

703
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,306
No. That's my Robbie.
That's my Robbie.

704
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:09,437
<i>I'm a good mother.</i>
<i>I'm a good mother.</i>

705
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,504
[Sobbing]
I'm a good mother.

706
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:18,116
- He's fine?
- He's perfect.

707
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,989
- [Sniffles] And you're sure?
- He's yours.

708
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:28,555
When I thought he was gone,
and Carlie...

709
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:32,625
<i>I wished I could've changed</i>
<i>how things had been.</i>

710
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,098
[Babbling]

711
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:38,266
<i>[Babbling Continues]</i>

712
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,673
Don't you want to hold him?

713
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:48,814
I don't know. Um...

714
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:52,322
The kind of guy I am... I'm no father.

715
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,654
You don't get to decide that.

716
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:58,451
<i>You have a son.</i>

717
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:02,124
Step up. Take him.

718
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,730
Hey.

719
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:11,297
[Laughs, Sighs]

720
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,536
[Sniffles]
Thank you.

721
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,704
<i>Thank you.</i>

722
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,771
<i>[Sniffles]</i>
<i>Mmm.</i>

723
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:19,782
Hey.

724
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:24,116
Oh. Mmm.

725
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,122
[Chuckles]

726
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:30,653
<i>So you think Richardson</i>
<i>can rise to the occasion?</i>

727
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:34,357
- Be a decent father?
- Well, he's got Carlie's parents to help him, and...

728
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,423
and I like to think
that people can change.

729
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,900
- Faith and hope, right?
- Right.

730
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:42,461
- Angela threw in love too.
- Love is good.

731
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,805
- Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
- <i>[Booth] Parker!</i>

732
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:49,209
- Look what I did.
- Wow! Look at that!

733
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:54,144
<i>Um, listen, you stay here</i>
<i>with Dr. Brennan, okay?</i>

734
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:56,482
I'm gonna go talk to

735
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,545
[Kisses]
All right?

736
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:02,023
Listen, uh, this is how
it's gotta go down?

737
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:04,253
I gotta meet your boyfriend
with Parker here?

738
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:07,695
- Look, man, we're here because we wanna...
- I'm talking to Rebecca.

739
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,526
Look, this was...
This was Drew's idea.

740
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:14,196
And I told him that
it was gonna be a bad one.

741
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:15,863
- Dad, look!
- One second, bud.

742
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,204
- Booth?
- Parker wanted you to see
what he made for school.

743
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:22,177
And he kept saying how much
he wanted us to meet, that we'd be friends.

744
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:28,178
<i>Look, I got a kid I don't</i>
<i>get to see much myself.</i>

745
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:31,119
<i>I know what it's like.</i>

746
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:34,646
And I swear the...
the explosives were for work.

747
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:37,125
Booth?

748
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:40,857
Okay, look, look, look, look, look.
We are what we are.

749

<i>Maybe this isn't a good time.</i>
<i>Maybe later.</i>

No. No, it's... it's a good time.

753
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:00,212
<i>Nah, it's cool.</i>
<i>Have a seat.</i>

- Bye.

- A di... A diorama.

- <i>[Booth] Whoa!</i>
- <i>[Parker] It's the zoo. Drew helped me.</i>

- Yeah.

- We got to go to the zoo.

00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:31,337
<i>Okay, well, maybe afterwards we could, uh,</i>
<i>all go out to dinner, if it's okay with your mom.</i>

765
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:35,950
Yeah. That... That sounds good.

766
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,615
- My dad knows a burgers place.
- <i>Yeah. I used to take him there after his T-ball.</i>

00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,658
<i>So go ahead.</i>
<i>Tell Drew about the burger.</i>

768
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,716
He says they're as big as my head.

769
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:46,695
Yeah, big as your head. We can all go.
We could even bring "Stu".
