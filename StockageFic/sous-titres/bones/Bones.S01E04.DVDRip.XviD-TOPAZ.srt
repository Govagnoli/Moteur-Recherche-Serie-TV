1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,436
- We know what killed the bear.
- Who's the vet here, Sherman?

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,750
You are, Denise. Who's the park ranger?

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,832
- That'd be you.
- That's why I know what killed him.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,276
A scared camper drilled him
with a Winchester Magnum.338.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,557
You're afraid I'm not showing respect
to the bear's spirit.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,918
I have better things to do than wait around
for you to tell me what I already know.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,709
The law says I have to send in
as much information as I can - age, weight,

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,268
what he last ate... Oh, yummy.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,158
Hot dogs, refried beans...

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,440
What's that?

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,159
- Beefjerky.
- Beefjerky?

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,109
He was in hyperphagia, eating everything he
could find before going into hibernation. Oh.

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,838
What?

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,514
Sherman, this is...

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,950
Oh, God.

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,750
- It looks human to me.
- Sorry.

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,389
- What's the deal?
- It was found in eastern Washington State.

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,516
- Where?
- Inside a bear.

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,637
No, I mean... Inside a bear?

20
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,429
Autopsy revealed bone fragments
in the bear's stomach and intestine.

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,795
An autopsy on an animal is a necropsy.

22
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,078
It's crucial we get that straight.
Meanwhile, about the dead human being...

23
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,991
What do you need me for?

24
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,470
26 bone fragments.
Case bumped to the Seattle field office.

25
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,791
- They bumped it to me. Check it out.
- Why'd they bump it to you?

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,112
Bones, I mean, do you really care
about the inner workings of the FBI office?

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,316
They bumped it to you cos you work with me.

28
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,188
No, they hoped
that you could help ID the body.

29
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,311
- From a hand?
- Well, they have high expectations.

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,520
Definitely human. Opposable thumb.
Probably male from the size.

31
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,352
Uh-oh.

32
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,750
- What?
- Kerf marks. Marks made from a cutting tool.

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,470
- Maybe when they cut open the bear.
- No. It's not a straight edge.

34
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,835
Residual cross-section striae.

35
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,550
- Just cos you say it in that definitive tone...
- These marks were made from a saw.

36
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,916
The hand was already separated
from the rest of the person.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,356
Somebody was dismembered
and fed to a bear?

38
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,795
That's one possibility.

39
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,873
- OK. Um, thanks, Bones.
- Glad I could help.

40
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,520
But you're not done.

41
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,111
I'll check out the x-rays,
see if I can confirm sex and age.

42
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,557
- Pack. We're going to Washington State.
- I'm not going to Washington State.

43
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,393
Again, just cos you say it
in that definitive tone

44
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,597
doesn't mean it means anything to me.

45
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,069
Why is Booth the one who decides?

46
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,152
He gets the gun and the authority.
He's the one people like.

47
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,994
Firstly, he didn't decide
that you go to Washington State.

48
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,231
I am the one who decides
where you do and do not go.

49
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,154
- And secondly?
- Secondly, it's time to live a little.

50
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,310
Connect with other people.

51
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,154
Are you suggesting I take this opportunity
to have sex with Booth?

52
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,755
- Good God. Where's Dr Freud?
- I don't understand what you're saying.

53
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,675
Which is precisely why I am sending you
to the Great North Woods.

54
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,754
Come on, now. You've partially digested,
dismembered skeletal remains to examine.

55
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,230
That should put a smile on your face.

56
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:31,111
The mosquitoes out there are the size
of dogs. Pack insect repellent.

57
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,192
Being cooped up in a crappy hotel
in the middle of nowhere with a $50 per diem

58
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,396
is not my idea of a good time either.

59
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,119
You only get $50 a day?
How can you live on that?

60
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,909
- OK, what do you get?
- I don't have a limit. I give them the receipts.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,912
No, you have to have a limit.
We work for the government.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,877
I don't have a limit.

63
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,114
But it's not fair. It's not fair to the taxpayers.
You're like one of those $1,000 toilet seats.

64
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,590
I'm treated differently
because I have an indispensable skill.

65
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,750
Indispensable(!) I do not need you.

66
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,277
Oh, so you can determine the origin of the
kerf marks and the sex and age of the victim?

67
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,318
- You know, you're a smart ass.
- I'd say I'm very smart,

68
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,550
although it has nothing to do with my ass.

69
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,679
You know, I'll tell you what. You can
take me out to dinner, put me on your tab.

70
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,593
That doesn't seem ethical.

71
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,275
You still want that gun, now, don't you? Hm?

72
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,029
We'll start with breakfast.

73
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,519
<i>(Booth) You know, it's beautiful here.</i>
<i>It feels good to be out of the city.</i>

74
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,479
<i>(Bones) Yeah.</i>
<i>Where murderers feed their victims to bears.</i>

75
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,950
<i>(grunts)</i>

76
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,029
Whew.

77
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,715
- Small-town America. Gotta love it.
- No, this is not a small town.

78
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,554
Chuntala in Guatemala, 150 people,
no running water, that's a small town.

79
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,837
I said small-town America,
not small-town Guatemala.

80
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,911
And I've been there too, by the way.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,151
- Where are you going?
- To see the sheriff.

82
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,913
- How are you gonna do that?
- It's an old FBI trick.

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,070
I'm gonna ask somebody who lives here.

84
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,470
What took you to Guatemala? Ecotourism?

85
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,799
I went down to shoot somebody
through the heart from 1500 feet.

86
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,635
I was pretty sure it was human, but I'm a vet,

87
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,918
so I called Andrew - Dr Rigby -
and he thought it was human too.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,195
Officially I'm the coroner here,

89
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,272
but I'm a country doctor.
I have no training in forensics.

90
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,878
This is approximately 60% of the arm
of a male, late teens, early 20s, well-muscled.

91
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,952
- That's amazing.
- You see these marks here?

92
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,068
Below the radial tuberosity? You haven't
performed any amputations lately, have you?

93
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,515
Uh, a few frostbit toes last winter,

94
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,558
and a thumb
from a nasty Murphy bed accident.

95
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,756
- Why?
- These are saw marks.

96
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,913
That's not good,
people sawed up and eaten by bears.

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,991
I'm gonna send this back to my lab.

98
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,789
My people can give a better estimate
of when the bear ingested the arm.

99
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,919
You got pretty good equipment there, I guess.
I'm still on dial-up.

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,549
- What's the fastest way to ship a human arm?
- <i>(all three)</i> Charlie.

101
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,469
- Need a hand?
- Thanks, but I'm trying to get rid of this one.

102
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,676
- These are human remains.
- Oh.

103
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,196
I have to ship them to
the Jeffersonian Institute in Washington, DC.

104
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,919
- Cool. They have Dizzy Gillespie's trumpet.
- I know.

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,436
Muhammad Ali's boxing gloves.
Abraham Lincolrs top hat.

106
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,478
- I work there.
- You ever sit in Archie Bunker's chair?

107
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,348
I work in a different part of the museum.
I'm a forensic anthropologist.

108
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,750
- My name's Charlie.
- Yeah, I know.

109
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,118
Wow. What, you could tell
from my, like, skull structure?

110
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,998
It says it on your shirt, Charlie.

111
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,789
- Where can I find the sheriff?
- He's, uh, past the garage to the right.

112
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,555
Hey. Temperance Brennan.
I'm reading your book.

113
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,428
Gave me a few ideas if I ever wanna
kill someone and get rid of the body.

114
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,640
Well, don't forget, Charlie,
the heroine always catches the bad guy.

115
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,915
Sounds good to me.

116
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,997
<i>(man)</i> These are false-start kerfs,
which suggest a handsaw.

117
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,438
The cut marks from the breakaway spur here
should give me the number of teeth per inch,

118
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,990
but to me itjust looks broken.

119
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,073
I could work it up into
a three-dimensional image, see if that helps.

120
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,833
Dr Brennan could do it from this.

121
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,469
Not when she was a lowly grad student, Zack.

122
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,270
Upload all the digital info that Brennan
sent you into my mainframe.

123
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,555
And lighten up, Z-man.

124
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,273
Somebody cut that guy's arm off, Sheriff.

125
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,275
Couldrt be a local. Somebody missing
an arm, that's something you notice.

126
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,397
- How many people live in Aurora?
- 326 in town.

127
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,153
Another couple hundred in the surroundings.

128
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,949
- Maybe 1200 on the Indian reservation.
- Tourists?

129
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,828
Hikers. It's beautiful country
so they don't realise it's dangerous.

130
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,230
On average we lose a couple of people a year.
Cycle of life, eh?

131
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,914
- Lose anyone recently?
- Woman, 29.

132
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,390
Ann Noyes from Olympia.
Disappeared a couple of weeks ago.

133
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,270
Her parents say she was
an "experienced hiker". <i>(snorts)</i>

134
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,755
- You must have a few resident crazies.
- Juvenile drinking, domestics, bar fights.

135
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,957
Joyriding.
The only felons we have are poachers.

136
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,919
They shoot the black bears
and sell the gall bladders on the black market.

137
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,356
Park ranger handles that stuff.

138
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,238
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. Thanks. I'm with him.

139
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,598
- Suddenly I wish I was FBI.
- <i>(laughs)</i> Sheriff Chris Scutter, Dr Brennan.

140
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,912
- My first forensic anthropologist.
- We need to find the rest of the body.

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,710
Sherman - Ranger Rivers - traced the bear's
route back a week. They didn't find anything.

142
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,792
- Is he some kind of an Indian scout?
- A Flathead Indian.

143
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,715
- But the bear was wearing a GPS collar.
- Did he check the scat?

144
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,633
You think there's more people parts
in the bear crap?

145
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,314
We could go with Sherman tomorrow,
take a look.

146
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,678
Oh, yeah. Now that you've met Bones,
you're all about interagency cooperation.

147
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,672
"Bones"? I don't think that's any way
to talk to a lady.

148
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,512
Thank you.

149
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,591
Do you have dinner plans?

150
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,877
We're working. Thanks for that.

151
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,473
All I am saying is,
why cut somebody into pieces?

152
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,791
Pack 'em tighter, maybe. Say, in a suitcase.

153
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,790
How did a bear open a suitcase?

154
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,590
I saw a documentary once
where a bear got in a car and drove away.

155
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,798
That was not a documentary. It was a can'toon.

156
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,511
Hello.

157
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,194
I'm looking for a Zack Addy.

158
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,794
Got a package of human remains.

159
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,633
I can sign for that.

160
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,835
- Where's Jimmy?
- Tahiti, Fiji, who knows? He won the lottery.

161
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,471
Is it too much of a line to say,
"No, <i>we</i> won the lottery"?

162
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,953
It is. Yeah. You know, I take it back.
It's just compared to you, Jimmy, you know...

163
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,828
- The third nostril.
- That whistling sound when he sneezes.

164
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,549
<i>(sighs)</i> Unfortunately,
it is too soon to ask you to have coffee.

165
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,519
- It is?
- Yes. Yes, coffee is the third-delivery capper.

166
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,357
- So what's the first-delivery capper?
- Initial contact, meet-cute, light flirting.

167
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,117
Then I'll catch you
in another couple of deliveries.

168
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,589
OK.

169
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,750
Bye.

170
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,156
- You bogarted my package.
- You panicked and froze, my man,

171
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,470
thus the package came into play.

172
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,552
Also, incorrect use of the verb "bogarted".

173
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,111
We've been looking for that female hiker,
but sometimes you never find a trace.

174
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,990
They fall into a ravine, the river...
So, how do you like the Evergreen Lodge?

175
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,312
Very nice. I have a beautiful view
of the mountains from my terrace.

176
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,152
- You have a terrace?
- Yeah.

177
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,231
I'm sharing a bathroom.

178
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,632
- This is where the bear was shot.
- How far did he get before he died?

179
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,190
- About 100 yards.
- How do you know that's the right way?

180
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,193
- Not hard to track a wounded bear.
- Ever hear of the bone gatherers?

181
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,034
Collecting bones so the dead
can make theirjourney to the next world?

182
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,509
I'm not even sure I believe in the next world.

183
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,876
Doesrt matter what you believe in.
You're a bone gatherer.

184
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,872
That's a good thing,
helping the spirits move on.

185
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,033
Thank you. That's probably
the bestjob description I'll ever get.

186
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,031
<i>(Booth)</i> Over here.

187
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,237
- You find something?
- Does a bear scat in the woods?

188
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,869
I think he voided here
and he headed off over there.

189
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,029
OK.

190
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,192
See if you can find any older samples.

191
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,477
- She ain't the squeamish type, is she?
- I'm gonna go out on a limb here, Sherman,

192
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,749
and guess you don't get a lot of eligible,
good-Iooking women coming through town.

193
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,117
- Hey. I just finished chapter seven.
- This has to go to my...

194
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,714
Do you do all the stuff
the girl in your book does?

195
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,360
I'm uncomfortable
discussing that with you.

196
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,672
I'm not talking about the sex. I'm talking
about the running and the shooting.

197
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,435
I mean, if you do do all that other stuff
that's great too,

198
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,911
for you and, um, whoever you're doing it with.

199
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,356
- I'd like to send this to my lab.
- Uh, more bones?

200
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,035
- No, it's bear scat.
- Oh. I can deal with that.

201
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,112
- <i>(phone rings)</i>
- Brennan.

202
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,873
The person who belonged to the arm
died a week ago,

203
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,793
and the bear ate it
one to three days after that.

204
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,839
- <i>(Bones) Anything from the saw?</i>
- Angela's entering the data.

205
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,674
I found something else I can't categorise.
Can I beam it to you?

206
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,751
OK. Hold on.

207
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,198
- Do you mind if I set this up here?
- Yeah. No problem.

208
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,199
- I'm connecting with the satellite.
- <i>All right.</i>

209
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,550
OK. I'm linked.

210
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,279
- <i>I've been focusing on...</i>
- So, who's that?

211
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,079
- My assistant, Zack.
- Hey, Zack.

212
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,628
- <i>Who's that?</i>
- The overnight guy. Charlie.

213
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,790
You can send me the picture.

214
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,075
- Zack, does your boss have a boyfriend?
- <i>Not currently.</i>

215
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,720
- <i>Are you extremely good-looking?</i>
- Yes, I am.

216
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,076
- Zack, these are bite marks.
- You mean from the bear?

217
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,674
Black bears' premolars are small and piglike.

218
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,196
- These marks show a double cusp pattern.
- Pigs are double-cusped.

219
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,670
- Hey, Zack, are you extremely smart?
- Yes, I am, Charlie.

220
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,799
Pigs have six incisors. These marks
were made by four incisors, like a chimp,

221
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,555
except these teeth form a continuous arch.

222
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,668
- <i>(Charlie) So, what's got a continuous arch?</i>
- Humans.

223
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,752
We don'tjust have a killer on our hands.

224
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,035
We have a cannibal.

225
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,549
Zack'll have the odontologist take a look,
but I'm right.

226
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,316
- A cannibal. You mean a Hannibal Lecter?
- I don't know what that means.

227
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,914
You're certain a human gnawed on that bone?

228
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,152
- Bit, gnawed, removed the flesh.
- That's... that's really not good.

229
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,789
Are you sure, Bones? You've never
seen anything like this before?

230
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,000
Of course I have. I did grad work among
the Wari'. They have a history of cannibalism.

231
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,358
I've seen evidence of cannibalism
in some 12th-century Native American sites.

232
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,238
- It's not a big deal.
- Have you ever...?

233
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,788
I've never been offered human flesh before.

234
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,952
- Maybe if you had...?
- It's an interesting question.

235
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,114
I'd have to measure my social inculcation
against objective scientific inquiry.

236
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,749
- OK, that's sick.
- Maybe someone who needs to be rescued.

237
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,960
Maybe the young man died and the missing
girl, hungry and lost, came upon him.

238
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,158
- Needing food, she...
- Sawed him up and barbecued him?

239
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,435
There's no evidence the hand was cooked.

240
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,751
She does not look like a girl
who would chew on raw flesh.

241
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,718
When survival instincts kick in...

242
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,633
If it isn't her,
we're dealing with some psycho killer.

243
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,597
This is sick.

244
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,989
Someone eating raw human flesh
is going to get sick.

245
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,350
- Teeth marks?
- Yes.

246
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,035
These drag marks are where the flesh
was ripped right off the bone.

247
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,749
- Ugh. It's like a zombie movie.
- Where is my bear poop?

248
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,435
Is it the excrement you're anxious to look at
or the courier?

249
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,469
- What do you think?
- Somebody gnawed on this arm like corn?

250
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,395
According to that team that crashed in
the Andes, human flesh tastes like frogs' legs.

251
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,996
- As though I need a reason never to eat frogs.
- I'm gonna make a cast of these markings.

252
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,470
We won't get a full dental impression,
but we'll get something.

253
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,754
Zack.

254
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,070
You're needed upstairs.

255
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,517
Angela.

256
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,831
If we were a soccer team
and crashed in the Andes,

257
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,639
who would you rather eat? Me or Zack?

258
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,038
<i>(sighs)</i>

259
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,314
What?

260
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,188
<i>(clears throat)</i>

261
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,512
- I have a package for a Zack Addy.
- That's me.

262
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,989
I thought... There was the other guy.

263
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:19,518
That was Hodgins. He zoomed you
because you're so beautiful.

264
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,036
- Thanks. That's sweet.
- L-I'm not being sweet.

265
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,190
It's just a fact.

266
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,196
- How old are you?
- 24.

267
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,271
24.

268
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,555
I could just eat you up.

269
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,914
Have you diagnosed
anyone with a prion disease?

270
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,514
Prion disease? No.

271
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,718
Some Alzheimer's, yes. Some brain damage
due to alcoholism and huffing.

272
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,758
Delusions? Erratic behaviour?
Violent outbursts?

273
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,752
The incubation period for a prion disease
can be years.

274
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,037
You're thinking the cannibal
might be showing symptoms?

275
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,112
Dr Rigby, I never said anything
about a cannibal.

276
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,668
Well, it's all over town.

277
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,470
Charlie. The overnight guy. What do you
think our chances are of keeping this quiet?

278
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,755
I'd say absolutely zero.

279
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,391
- I was waiting to see her.
- You were waiting for bear poop.

280
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,234
I said, "Are you excited about it?"
And you said, "What do you think?"

281
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,474
- You thought I was excited about excrement?
- You have to be clear.

282
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,755
What's that?

283
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,751
- It's a piece of undigested bone.
- Metacarpal.

284
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,308
I think that goes with my hand.

285
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,789
<i>(Hodgins)</i> Part of a tin can.

286
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,876
Elastin fibres.

287
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,871
Some kind of sporocarp.

288
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,871
Here's something.

289
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,076
Hair follicles. Sebaceous glands.
It's a layer of dermis.

290
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,756
- Pigmentation marks in the microphage.
- A flap of skin with a tattoo.

291
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,035
We need a tattoo expert.

292
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,111
It's fairly simple.
Uh, two colours, red and black.

293
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,038
- Some kind of native design.
- She likes me more than she likes you.

294
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,113
- She said I was sweet.
- I made her laugh at Jimmy's third nostril.

295
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,829
That's pretty good,
making a woman laugh at a third nostril.

296
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,390
- We have a tentative coffee date.
- She said she wanted to eat me up.

297
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,677
Zack's definitely ahead on points.

298
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,670
There it is.

299
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,033
- <i>The skin in the scat has a sun on it.</i>
- What is that? A haiku?

300
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,270
It's a tattoo.

301
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,319
Hi, Booth.
Hi. I'm Angela Montenegro.

302
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,392
- <i>How you doing, Angela?</i>
- <i>Angela, focus, please.</i>

303
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,471
It's a Haida sun motif.

304
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,588
Good work. Very impressive. 18 to 25-year-old
man, Haida sun tattoo on his arm?

305
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,468
<i>Hey, Booth, I have kind of a thing for tattoos.</i>
<i>You got any?</i>

306
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,869
<i>Angela.</i>

307
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,318
I'm sorry, sweetie, but what's with that town?
You getting any from that hot overnight guy?

308
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,029
- <i>Ange, we're trying to work.</i>
- Is that town totally wasted on you?

309
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,795
Because I take this as a sign from God
to loosen up.

310
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,795
You know what they say.
What happens in Aurora stays in Aurora.

311
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,595
Hey.

312
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,595
I'm running a missing persons check
using the new info on the tattoo.

313
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,990
- She seems friendly, your associate.
- She's 3,000 miles away.

314
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,958
I'd send away for a Russian bride.

315
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:00,034
Adam Langer, 22.
Missing ten days from college in Richland.

316
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,875
Wait, I know this kid. He used to come up
to visit Sherman. Wanted to be a ranger.

317
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,470
Look, I've known Sherman for years.
I can't believe he had anything to do with this.

318
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,551
<i>(knocks)</i>

319
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,913
- Hey, Sheriff.
- Hey, Sherman. Mind if we come in?

320
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,231
- You here about the cannibal?
- We can't talk about business.

321
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,788
- How's about some tea?
- Sure.

322
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,675
Oh, yeah.

323
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,716
What'd you do that for?

324
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,236
Give you a chance to look around,
get a sense of the man.

325
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,269
The raven spirit. In Native American stories

326
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,239
- it has a cannibalistic element.
- <i>(thumping)</i>

327
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,039
He went out back. Give me your flashlight.

328
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,352
- No way you'll catch Sherman in the woods.
- <i>(Booth)</i> Just search the place.

329
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,034
Sherman, stop.

330
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,797
I don't know if a wall of knives is evidence,
but it is creepy.

331
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,755
Hey. Hey, stop!

332
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,075
<i>(Bones)</i> Is there a saw?

333
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,668
Yup.

334
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,275
We wanna take it, see if it matches
the cuts in Adam Langer's bones.

335
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,669
And see if this matches the teeth marks.

336
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,956
You gotta be kidding me.

337
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,911
As justice of the peace
I authorise you to open that freezer.

338
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,991
Thank you.

339
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,072
What kind of meat do you think that is?

340
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,393
I sent a bunch of frozen meat by overnight air.
I need to know what it is.

341
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,037
- You think it's human?
- <i>Maybe. It's a funny colour.</i>

342
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,588
- Did you catch the guy?
- No. Booth lost him.

343
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,194
- Whoa. I didn't lose him.
- You didn't catch him.

344
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,316
- So you two have the night free.
- <i>Yes.</i>

345
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,837
We can't do anything. Booth has to wait
till it's light to look for the guy he lost.

346
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,990
I didn't lose him, OK? I... He...

347
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,435
Tell her that my flashlight died.

348
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,112
- She doesn't care.
- What?

349
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,668
- Give me that.
- It's not safe to drive and talk.

350
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,718
- Are you two fighting?
- Professional pride. Tell her.

351
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,873
Booth wants you to know that he lost the guy
because his flashlight died.

352
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,670
And because he's an Indian and a park ranger
and he's very familiar with the territory.

353
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,320
- Did you hear that?
- Something about Indians?

354
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,790
She says she understands.
I need to know about that meat ASAP.

355
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,030
- <i>I'll tell Zack.</i>
- Give me the phone.

356
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,350
- What?
- It wasrt even my flashlight.

357
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,228
It was the sheriff's flashlight
and his batteries, they ran out. OK?

358
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,790
- Good night, Angela.
- Hey. You have to take that man for a drink.

359
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,155
And have a little fun yourself.

360
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,879
Fun and a drink. Where do we find that?

361
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:04,075
So, I was surprised to see you here. In your
book you never sleep till you get your man.

362
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,312
That's not me. That's a character.
In real life you have to wait for lab results.

363
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,675
- I see. Well, lucky for me.
- I don't know.

364
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,149
I'm not a very good dancer. Apparently I lead.

365
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,631
- So I'll follow.
- Hey, Booth. Want a beer? Another beer.

366
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,077
I climbed with Adam sometimes. I was
freaked out when I found out it was his arm.

367
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,391
- You knew Adam Langer?
- I taught him how to climb.

368
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,598
Man, he was strong. No matter how much
I lift, I could never match him.

369
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,356
You have excellent definition
in your biceps and triceps.

370
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,353
Well, thanks.
And your waist muscles feel good too.

371
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,079
Transverse abdominals. Thank you.

372
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,559
So, that meat we sent back to your lab,
that wasrt more of Adam, was it?

373
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,916
- I can't discuss...
- <i>Excusez-moi.</i>

374
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,149
Dr Rigby.

375
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,357
I can't imagine you and Charlie
have a lot to talk about.

376
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,271
We were managing.

377
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,079
<i>(Rigby)</i> I guess it looks
pretty bad for Sherman.

378
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,720
I can't discuss the investigation with you.

379
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,360
Look, Sherman is a Flathead.

380
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,910
The spiritual beliefs of his tribe
don't value cannibalism.

381
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,151
Anthropology teaches us
that beliefs and customs evolve.

382
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,312
That's why you still find
cannibalism practised today.

383
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,278
You can justify the act of eating
another human being?

384
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,351
I can understand it intellectually.

385
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,389
I shouldn't be talking shop,
not with such a beautiful woman in my arms.

386
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:29,635
Sheriff time. You think you can match the bite
marks on the apple with those on that arm?

387
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,598
I'm not comfortable discussing it
on the dance floor.

388
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,878
- I'm the sheriff. We're colleagues.
- Mind if I cut in?

389
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,350
- Thought you might need a break.
- What happened to your shirt?

390
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,115
- Well, we're in a bar. It's a look.
- Everybody's pumping me.

391
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,760
- Sorry?
- For information on the case.

392
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,832
- They're only pretending to be interested.
- Why?

393
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,115
- They're hitting on you.
- Are you sure?

394
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,113
Yes, I'm sure. You're the hottest thing
this town has seen in a long time.

395
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,270
Check out the competition.

396
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,995
Now, that is someone
who wants to eat your heart.

397
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,430
<i>(Angela)</i> Ooh, very pretty.

398
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:14,311
Lovely. It's a sporocarp called
<i>Tuber gibbosum</i> after a week in bear poop.

399
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,235
- Thank you for ruining my moment.
- It's a mushroom. An Oregon white truffle.

400
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,472
A mycorrhizal species that only grows
in symbiosis with Douglas fir trees.

401
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,314
- Are Douglas fir trees very rare in the woods?
- No.

402
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,631
- Then you haven't found anything useful.
- No.

403
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,792
- You wanna get something to eat?
- No.

404
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,952
- Oh, you're expecting a delivery tonight.
- Zack is.

405
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,874
- And you're going to zoom him.
- Like the Indy 500, baby.

406
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,909
- <i>(Booth)</i> You didn't come down for breakfast.
- I wasrt hungry. Sorry you had to pay.

407
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,516
- I called your room. There was no answer.
- Why the sudden interest in my habits?

408
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,149
I just thought we were gonna
get something to eat, so I waited.

409
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,516
My eggs got cold, that's all. Cold eggs.

410
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,159
- This is where my flashlight failed.
- <i>My</i> flashlight. And how can you be sure?

411
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,028
- Cos this is where I was standing.
- <i>(Scutter)</i> A shirt button?

412
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,749
And I heard him, uh,
disappear in this direction.

413
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,753
Leaving buttons on the trail.
Must be an old fish-chewer trick.

414
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,628
You mean a snake eater.
An old snake-eater trick.

415
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,469
- Were you here all night?
- Yes. Did I miss Toni?

416
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,788
Yes.

417
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,077
- She asked about you.
- And you torpedoed me, didn't you?

418
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,914
No, I told her the truth.
That you were sifting through excrement.

419
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,039
You want a war?
Fine, because I am the warrior.

420
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,556
Zack, I got the measurements for your saw
from the Angelator.

421
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,270
Now all you have to do is find a match.
Say thank you with gifts.

422
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,239
- Did you work all night?
- Yes. I shaved the truffle.

423
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,869
- Is that anything like spanking the monkey?
- I found boring dust.

424
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,475
- <i>(Angela)</i> Is there any other kind?
- It's produced by beetles.

425
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,755
The tree the truffle grew on was infested.

426
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,513
- That won't impress Toni.
- That's not why I did it.

427
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,558
I did it to serve justice and capture a cannibal.

428
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,359
That'll impress the hot courier.

429
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,510
I am back in the game.

430
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,150
No way you'll catch Sherman in the woods.
He's a park ranger and an Indian.

431
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,959
Right there.

432
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,600
Oh. He's doing some kind of Indian ritual.

433
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,830
- Waiting for us.
- <i>(phone rings)</i>

434
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,832
The meat samples you sent us
were all <i>Ursus americanus.</i>

435
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,480
Black bear.

436
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,233
- I didn't kill no one.
- Why'd you run?

437
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,518
You're FBI.
Ever hear of Leonard Peltier? Pine Ridge?

438
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,151
- Wounded Knee? Indians and FBI don't mix.
- He ran because he's the poacher.

439
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,312
- You're the poacher?
- The meat we found was black bear.

440
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,356
No wonder you never caught him.

441
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,638
You should look out for a patch of wood
infested with <i>Dendroctonus brevicomis.</i>

442
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,874
Hodgins says that the bear dug up the arm
in a stand of pine-beetle-infested Douglas fir.

443
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,478
Say you did catch a poacher, an Indian who
shouldn't have to follow white mars law.

444
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:14,315
- Not even a park ranger?
- He could show you a stand of trees like that.

445
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,359
- Would you maybe let that Indian go?
- The saw is 300mm

446
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,513
with 32 offset teeth per inch
with a wobble factor of 1/100th of an inch.

447
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,989
That's a common hacksaw.
That won't help us.

448
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,390
I'm just wondering
if you'll be sending us any more samples.

449
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,270
Yeah, uh, even more of the same samples,
in case we wanna double-check the data.

450
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,078
I'll let you know. <i>(hangs up)</i>

451
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,550
- Do you think she'll send more?
- God in heaven, I hope so.

452
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,589
Japanese pay a fortune for bear meat. Think
the gall bladders fix up their pecker troubles.

453
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,752
Would've gotten away with it
if you hadrt kept the meat.

454
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,595
- I'm not admitting nothing.
- He couldn't bring himself to waste the meat.

455
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,958
This patch of trees is all infested with beetles.

456
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,952
According to the GPS,
the bear was here seven days ago.

457
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,157
- <i>(Bones)</i> Fits the time line.
- What are we looking for?

458
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,153
I'm guessing a shallow grave
that's been disrupted by a hungry bear.

459
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,313
Or maybe some kind of
satanic Stonehenge circle.

460
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,548
We see this all the time. Kids get baked, do
their own version of <i>The Blair Witch Project.</i>

461
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,599
- I don't know what that means.
- It's a horror movie, Bones.

462
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,992
- Didrt make any sense.
- Scary, though, with the bloody hand prints.

463
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,278
I'm gonna beam you some stills
of what looks like a ritualistic Indian site.

464
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,397
- A medicine wheel of some kind.
- This thing legit?

465
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,152
What am I, a shaman?

466
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,711
Goodman is an expert in Native American
anthropology. He'll tell you what it means.

467
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,712
Sherman, you're looking guiltier
by the minute.

468
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,314
Oh, shut up, Chris. You know better than that.

469
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:55,599
<i>(Scutter)</i> Hey, you're a poacher, man.
I sure as hell didn't see that coming either.

470
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,031
Got something?

471
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,113
Waxy leaves means methane gas
is leeching from the soil.

472
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,634
Like a body?

473
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,317
- <i>(Sherman)</i> That's Adam Langer.
- <i>(Bones)</i> Oh, there's a woman here, too.

474
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,550
Probably Ann Noyes, the hiker.

475
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,433
And she's missing her heart.

476
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,192
<i>(Goodman)</i> It's a perversion
of a Salish medicine wheel.

477
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:43,593
This is the Spirit Chief Chichaumichu. The
southern stone should represent strength.

478
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,592
The centre of the wheel
should represent life force.

479
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,275
- This is upside down and inside out.
- We're dealing with a cannibal.

480
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:55,195
You could interpret this as a way of taking
energy from someone by eating their flesh.

481
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,033
Zoom in.

482
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,795
Yeah.

483
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,316
This is the symbol for strength, the arm.

484
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,915
This one is for spirit, the heart.

485
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,232
This one for knowledge...
and this is for courage.

486
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,677
So we're looking for maybe a scarecrow,
tin man or a lion?

487
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,672
You say two bodies were found?

488
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,228
<i>(Angela)</i> Over here.
They were dug up by a bear.

489
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:29,316
One showing signs that his arm was eaten
by the cannibal, the other missing her heart.

490
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,239
There should be two more bodies
to complete the ritual.

491
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,676
They checked the site.
There were only these two.

492
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,753
If I've analysed this correctly,
it means there will be two more victims.

493
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,034
- Both killed by gunshots to the head.
- These stellate patterns at the entry wounds

494
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,908
indicate a low-calibre handgun at close range.

495
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,514
- That's remarkable.
- Not really.

496
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,276
Based on adipocere formation, I'm estimating
the female has been dead for about...

497
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,112
A week?

498
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,395
- Very good.
- Thanks.

499
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,673
Well, her clothing matches that of Ann Noyes,
and the male is Adam Langer.

500
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,751
My people at the Jeffersonian tell me

501
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,435
the medicine wheel suggests
a perversion of an old healing ritual.

502
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,830
He may have eaten the arm for strength
and the heart for spirit.

503
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:20,710
Well, that makes sense from a certain
point of view. Do they think it's an Indian?

504
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,633
- No way to tell.
- Look, I'm no policeman,

505
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,679
but it doesn't make sense that Sherman
would lead you straight to the evidence

506
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,150
that proves he's a murderer and a cannibal.

507
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,276
Adam was a good guy.

508
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,669
He wanted to be a park ranger.

509
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,991
- I was a... What do you call it?
- His mentor?

510
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,230
That's right. His mentor.

511
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:46,189
Taking him out with me on my rounds,
showing him the ropes of the job.

512
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:51,229
Well, maybe Adam found out you were
poaching so you made sure he wouldn't talk.

513
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,711
So I ate his arm and someone's heart for
dessert because that's the type of guy I am.

514
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,951
You know he fits the description
of someone missing an arm.

515
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,838
Why don't you say anything?

516
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,878
Somebody says maybe
they're gonna come and visit.

517
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,034
Maybe they do, maybe they don't. Maybe
they go see their climbing buddy instead.

518
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,112
- Charlie?
- <i>(Booth)</i> The overnight guy?

519
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,876
- Maybe sometimes they go visit a girl.
- What girl?

520
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,633
I'm not comfortable saying.

521
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:26,078
Well, maybe, what with the murders and
cannibalism, you get past that discomfort.

522
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,873
Adam had a thing with the vet lady.
So did his buddy Charlie.

523
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,190
You know how jealous white people can be.

524
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,798
Um, in the interest of full disclosure,
I gotta say I see Denise from time to time, too.

525
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,235
What? You find that funny?

526
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,551
- The apple we found in Shermars cabin?
- You get a mould?

527
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:50,077
<i>(Zack) The mould from the apple</i>
<i>does not match the teeth marks on the bone.</i>

528
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,152
- What does that mean?
- It means you aren't the cannibal.

529
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,913
- I already knew that.
- The point was to convince us.

530
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,753
Do we start checking
everybody's teeth in town?

531
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,989
Not everybody.

532
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,390
We consume, we are consumed.

533
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,634
We are consumed by greed,
by ambition, lust, jealousy.

534
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,793
- Dr Randall, if you'd like...
- Even regular love is a form of cannibalism.

535
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,916
Could you put the dental medium...?

536
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,879
The whole perfect idea of love
is that two people become one.

537
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,590
- Now, that's a kind of consumption.
- We're talking something a little more literal.

538
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,832
- We need her to bite it.
- Why didn't you report him missing?

539
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,992
Because I would've had to admit
that he and I were lovers.

540
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,277
- Why not admit it?
- It would've made another guy angry.

541
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,715
What other guy?

542
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,279
Charlie.

543
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,032
And Sheriff Scutter.

544
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:44,033
And Andrew Rigby,
and maybe a couple of others. I don't...

545
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:50,588
Well, there's not a lot to do in a place
like Aurora, so what you do, you do lots.

546
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,955
- Can you bite this?
- If I were your cannibal,

547
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,477
would I have pointed out that there were
human bones in the bear after the autopsy?

548
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,030
An autopsy on an animal is called a necropsy.

549
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:06,396
Yeah. There's a reason
I get all the guys and you don't.

550
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:12,396
And let me tell you, if I ate Adam,
there wouldn't be anything left.

551
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,673
<i>(Zack)</i> Here and here.
These look like tooth marks again.

552
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,637
- OK.
- But they're too regular.

553
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,352
They're exactly 2.4mm apart. Teeth aren't
that exact. It has to be some kind of machine.

554
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,796
- She was eaten by a machine?
- I don't know.

555
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,316
We got a love triangle.
Quadrangle, octangle, whatever.

556
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,756
- Jealousy, always a good motive.
- For murdering Adam Langer.

557
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,879
But Ann Noyes? And the cannibalism?
We're looking for someone who's insane.

558
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,350
The rant the vet had about people
consuming each other was wacky.

559
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,671
Yeah, but kind of true, don't you think?
Hey, Angela.

560
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,436
- <i>Zack wants to beam you something.</i>
- OK. Hold on a second.

561
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,913
See if you can tell what it is. But if you're
in a public place, cover your screen.

562
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,310
- What am I looking at?
- <i>(Zack) Indentations on Noyes'sternum.</i>

563
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,356
- <i>(Bones)</i> Magnification?
- <i>40.</i>

564
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,830
I can't believe both Dr Rigby
and I missed these. Good job.

565
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,718
- What are they?
- How far apart are they?

566
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,597
2.4mm.

567
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:18,710
OK. These marks and the splitting of the
bone here were made by a sternum spreader.

568
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,268
There's no record of Ann
having heart surgery.

569
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,793
Rigby didn't miss it.

570
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,873
- Moments like this are why I need a gun.
- <i>(sighs)</i>

571
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,952
Where else do you keep them? Thank you.

572
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,510
That is for self-defence,
so don'tjust go blasting away in there.

573
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,910
What if I have to shoot?
What part of his body should I hit?

574
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,709
The part that isn't me. Just stay back.

575
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,234
- The bodies are gone.
- What's he gonna do?

576
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:50,758
- Take 'em into the woods for a snack?
- If I were him, I'd destroy the evidence.

577
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,273
Step away from the incinerator, Dr Rigby.

578
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,069
You don't understand.
It's a spiritual right to share the life force.

579
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:11,359
You're nuts. We get it. We don't need the
rambling psycho speech on why you did it.

580
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,069
You know that ancient civilisations
would sacrifice some

581
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,596
in order to preserve
the strength and... <i>(groans)</i>

582
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,469
- What'd you do that for?
- Nobody wants that rambling psycho speech.

583
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,915
A bedpan?

584
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,429
Hm.

585
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,711
<i>(drops bedpan)</i>

586
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,758
- Why do we have to face her together?
- Want this settled?

587
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,718
I'd definitely like this settled.

588
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:44,310
- What are you doing here?
- It's like watching <i>Clash of the Horny Titans.</i>

589
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:52,393
- Who'd like to sign for this?
- Who wouldn't want to sign for it?

590
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,397
So the idea is whoever signs for this...

591
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,349
- Yes. The act of signing is an analogue for...
- She gets it.

592
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,795
Oh.

593
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,831
Oh.

594
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,918
Oh.

595
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,196
That is really sweet.

596
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,271
Thank you.

597
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,430
That is so hot.

598
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,034
Why? Why is that hot?

599
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:42,672
- It'd be hotter if she'd chosen me.
- No, this is definitely hotter.

600
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,790
And to think I didn't wanna come here.
This was a fascinating case.

601
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,917
You don't often find cannibalism
so close to home.

602
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,228
Which I find a plus.

603
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,916
There are always individuals within a species
who are driven to break the basic taboos.

604
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,949
- I mean, Rigby actually ate human flesh.
- Bones, I just got my steak and eggs.

605
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,555
Rigby has a prion disease.
He's been a cannibal for some time.

606
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,428
- He could use the insanity defence.
- The guy <i>is</i> nuts.

607
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,719
Is he nuts cos he got a brain disease from
eating human flesh, or was he already nuts?

608
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,634
Or did he just lick his fingers after surgery?

609
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,113
- I should just become a vegetarian.
- Or as an alternative, just don't eat people.

610
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,030
You know, I'm gonna
come back up here this winter.

611
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,236
Charlie says the skiing's great.

612
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,595
Oh, Charlie.

613
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,875
Yeah. The overnight guy.

614
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,229
- Yeah. I know who he is.
- I bet he's a great skier.

615
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,553
His hips and thighs are perfectly developed
for strength and manoeuvrability.

616
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,234
- That's it. I'm done.
- What?

617
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,913
No good?

618
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,309
Do you want some cornflakes?

619
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,319
- Want some?
- No.
