1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
I never get used to the magnitude of this place,

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,570
what it's taken to keep this country free.

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,190
All societies build monuments to their dead

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,680
to convince future combatants that it's an honor to die in battle.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,460
Well, for these servicemen, it was, you know?

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,310
And somebody to use this place to protest the war... it just pisses me off.

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,200
These are the lives that gave them that right.

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,060
These men... they should be respected.

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,990
If they were really respected, maybe not so many of them would be buried here.

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,380
Are we going to get into something here, bones?

11
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,330
I don't see why.

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,600
I think we both wish this place were a lot smaller.

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,220
Agent Booth, dr. Brennan, right this way.

14
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:37,160
Must have happened in the middle of the night.

15
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,900
Place is so big, no one saw the fire.

16
00:00:44,806 --> 00:00:46,940
The accelerant was charcoal starter.

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,760
We didn't find a suicide note.

18
00:00:49,139 --> 00:00:51,240
If he was a protestor, wouldn't he leave a note?

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,380
Didn't need to.

20
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,050
It's on Charlie Kent's grave.

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,860
Press was coming out this morning to do a tribute to him.

22
00:00:57,372 --> 00:00:59,000
It's the one-year anniversary of his death.

23
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,353
Charlie Kent?

24
00:01:00,388 --> 00:01:01,510
He was in the national guard.

25
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,870
He was about to be drafted by the NBA when he got shipped out to Iraq.

26
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,230
He gave his life taking out a group of insurgents to save his unit.

27
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:10,890
Won the silver star.

28
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:17,240
It's male, african descent, approximately 20 to 29 years old.

29
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,710
Too early to determine cause of death.

30
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,390
I'm not a pro, but I'm guessing fire.

31
00:01:22,914 --> 00:01:25,120
The white house and DoD want an ID as soon as possible.

32
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,660
So they can brand him a traitor.

33
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,220
Why do you have to be so cynical?

34
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,550
I'm not cynical. It's a necessary part of the psychology of warfare...

35
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:35,780
Heroes and villains. Without clear distinctions like that, we'd never be able to fight.

36
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,540
Yeah, well, I always found being shot at

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,320
is a motivating factor.

38
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,920
Bag these fragments of his clothing.

39
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,620
I also want any singed plant life or debris you find around him.

40
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,240
I'm on it.

41
00:01:55,634 --> 00:01:56,680
What?

42
00:01:58,114 --> 00:01:59,630
That was Jamie Richards.

43
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,150
We were in the rangers together.

44
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:08,150
He was hit by a roadside bomb just outside the green zone.

45
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:14,010
You know, he left a... a wife and two kids.

46
00:02:16,113 --> 00:02:18,310
The fact that he was near this...

47
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,800
You believe somehow he's still here watching?

48
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:25,290
Yeah. You don't. I get that.

49
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,530
I know you think he was a good man. That's...

50
00:02:30,892 --> 00:02:32,590
that's enough for me.

51
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,680
Zack, I want pictures of all remaining tissue before he's moved.

52
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,470
Ah... I used to love watching Kent play. He could fly.

53
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,800
He made 46.4% of his three-point attempts in his last season.

54
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,190
A basketball fan. I'm surprised, mr. Addy.

55
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,740
Zack, I'd like you to keep cleaning the bones.

56
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,821
Did you see the game against North Carolina? 53 points, and he grabbed 18 rebounds.

57
00:03:04,856 --> 00:03:06,080
Zack...

58
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:08,320
Sorry. Cleaning.

59
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,560
It's difficult knowing Kent will never play again.

60
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,260
It makes the war so real.

61
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,410
Which is odd, since it was all fiction that got us there in the first place.

62
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,700
So you don't think we should stand up to tyrants?

63
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,970
Sure.

64
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,730
I've been waiting for the press to do that for three years now.

65
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,670
I can't believe you took the bait.

66
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,760
Yeah. Me, neither.

67
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,640
Ugh... press office at defense.

68
00:03:30,255 --> 00:03:32,410
Please ID him. This is the third call in an hour.

69
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,640
Hello.

70
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,990
Yes. It's a pleasure to hear from you again, sir.

71
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,200
Yes. We're very close.

72
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,530
All right, I fed his dentals, approximate age,

73
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:46,270
height, along with a rough sketch I made from the tissue markers into the DOD database.

74
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,450
Victim had lamb about an hour before his death.

75
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,470
Of course, it's a little overcooked now.

76
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,360
He toasted himself. Who cares what he ate?

77
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,410
Just doing our jobs, Booth.

78
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,510
Big boys telling you to sweep this one under the rug?

79
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,350
Just can the left-wing conspiracies, Hodgins.

80
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,590
This is probably one of your nut-ball friends here on the table.

81
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,430
Don't think so.

82
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,670
The fabric found at the scene was cotton with synthetic polymers; dye: olive-green.

83
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,100
This dude was wearing a military uniform.

84
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,180
He's one of yours, not mine.

85
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,050
Okay. His name is Devon Marshall.

86
00:04:15,934 --> 00:04:18,000
He served in the guard with Kent.

87
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:18,780
What?

88
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,260
He was there in Mosul the night Kent was killed.

89
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,740
He was protesting?

90
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,300
Marshall could have had a change of heart.

91
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,350
It's not like support for the war is increasing.

92
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,010
Yeah, but it also could have been survivor's guilt.

93
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,180
The guy who saved his life didn't make it.

94
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,620
You can't imagine what it's like carrying that around.

95
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,290
I don't think so, Booth.

96
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,060
There's evidence of damage on the external auditory meatus.

97
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,500
Here and here.

98
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,170
I'm sorry, you know, but I left my phrasebook at home.

99
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,740
The opening in the skull where the auditory nerves feed into the brain.

100
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,070
So we're talking ear hole.

101
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:49,045
Yes.

102
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,410
You know, they simplified these words for a reason, people.

103
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,200
Something was jabbed into his ear.

104
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,370
Okay, that's clear, but why?

105
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,120
There are scrapings within the cranium

106
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,510
and marks on the inside of the parietal and occipital.

107
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,260
Whatever was used was pushed completely through his skull.

108
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,530
Someone scrambled his brain, then set the fire,

109
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,770
so there'd be no tissue left to see what had been done.

110
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,140
Exactly.

111
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,750
Devon Marshall didn't die in the fire. He was murdered first.

112
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:52,950
Marshall was against the war.

113
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,371
They knew he'd look like a protester, so no one would expect murder.

114
00:05:56,406 --> 00:05:58,260
As far as anyone knows, this is still a suicide.

115
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,220
I want the killer to think that he got away with it, all right?

116
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,080
He's smart. I want the edge.

117
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,420
Okay, Zack, then magnify the marks on the cranium.

118
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,270
Call me if you match them to any kind of weapon.

119
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:11,540
You know, I'm just going to be asking his mother a few questions.

120
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,050
You could've just stayed back there and played with your bones.

121
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,530
I know. Just wanted to keep you company, that's all.

122
00:06:18,204 --> 00:06:18,960
Company?

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,720
Yeah. I'm trying to be more sociable, you know.

124
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,240
Lousy liar.

125
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,760
I just think inside you're still military, Booth.

126
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,050
You might be too close to this one.

127
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,450
I just want to make sure you stay objective.

128
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,540
I know how to do my job, okay?

129
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,140
I was doing it just fine, long before I met you.

130
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,250
You're angry.

131
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,470
Well, because I have people all around me with opinions about the war

132
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,290
who don't know what the hell they're talking about.

133
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,570
I've been in Sudan, Rwanda, for two months, I sifted through t wreckage of 9/11,

134
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,910
trying to help the families of the victims.

135
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,940
All I'm saying is that this is just another case, that's all.

136
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,750
It just... it's another case.

137
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,350
You're not such a great liar, yourself.

138
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,150
I'm your partner.

139
00:07:01,948 --> 00:07:03,970
Let me be your partner.

140
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,440
Did he, uh, have any troubles since he came back? Any personal problems?

141
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,480
Some days...

142
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,830
...I didn't know him.

143
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,000
He used to be very outgoing, happy.

144
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,550
But since he came back, all he did was spend time with his little sister.

145
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,750
Take her to school, help her with her homework.

146
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,170
Said his job now was keeping me safe.

147
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:37,500
But most of the time, it was like I was taking care of him.

148
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,850
It was like he was scared all the time.

149
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,000
Did he, uh...

150
00:07:42,674 --> 00:07:46,230
did he talk, you know, to anyone else that he served with?

151
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,760
Just Jimmy. He'd talk to him.

152
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,820
When Jimmy wasn't in the hospital, the V.A.

153
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,360
When he was over there,

154
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,800
he really believed in what he was doing.

155
00:07:57,488 --> 00:08:02,420
He wrote us all the time, saying how good he felt seeing the people free...

156
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,770
voting,

157
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,000
'cause he remembered when his grandpa was a young man...

158
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,650
...he didn't have the right to vote.

159
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,090
When can I have my son back? When can I lay him to rest?

160
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,200
Soon, mrs. Marshall.

161
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,070
We just want to make sure we have all the facts.

162
00:08:37,464 --> 00:08:38,730
I know it's his sister,

163
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,500
but it seems odd for a grown man to spend so much time with a 13-year-old.

164
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,050
No. You come back from combat, it's still all over you. You know?

165
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,530
You want to be around something pure. Something innocent.

166
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,210
Adults... they want you to relive it all.

167
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,340
They want war stories, like they're entertainment.

168
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,640
It makes them feel better.

169
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,110
If they hear you survived, then maybe war isn't so bad.

170
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,659
John Wayne syndrome.

171
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,920
Don't tell me you're going to trash the Duke now.

172
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,590
What, are you kidding? I love the Duke.

173
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,180
Wouldn't have guessed that one, little lady.

174
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,160
Remember stagecoach?

175
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,500
Listen, cowboy, courage is being scared to death but saddling up anyway.

176
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,170
What was that, the duke? That was horrible.

177
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,237
That was like Jerry Lewis...

178
00:09:12,272 --> 00:09:13,274
Was not.

179
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,800
Just a couple of quick questions, Jimmy.

180
00:09:18,577 --> 00:09:21,130
I- I... I can't... I can't talk about Devon now, man. I-I...

181
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,470
I- I just can't.

182
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,850
Why can't you leave him alone? He's got enough troubles.

183
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,550
I understand, okay? It's...

184
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:30,600
readjusting... takes time.

185
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,620
It's different for every one of us.

186
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,560
It sure as hell was different for Devon.

187
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,510
He's gone, man.

188
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,310
Son of a bitch should have never checked out on me like that.

189
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,110
That's when Jimmy came back in here, when he heard about Devon.

190
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,480
He was doing pretty good before that.

191
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,400
Baby, I can't hold a job yet.

192
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:49,760
I can't even provide for my family.

193
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,840
Did you and Devon ever argue?

194
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,210
Oh, no, we-we had to stick together. That's what it was all about.

195
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,860
Devon would call and Jimmy would take off to meet him.

196
00:09:58,003 --> 00:10:01,360
Middle of dinner, playing with Sarah, it didn't matter, Jimmy would go.

197
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,000
He needed me, Karen.

198
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,850
Man, you served, you know what it's like when you get back.

199
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,440
You got no one but the guys you served with.

200
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,860
You and Devon would visit corporal Kent's grave site?

201
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:18,780
It never should've happened like that, not to Kent.

202
00:10:19,341 --> 00:10:22,510
We would go and tell him that. We... we were sorry.

203
00:10:23,158 --> 00:10:24,430
We needed him to know.

204
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:26,490
I understand.

205
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,860
I don't.

206
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,430
How did it happen, Jimmy?

207
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:31,880
It doesn't matter, Bones.

208
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:34,160
But, Booth...

209
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,119
We'll see you later, okay, Jimmy?...

210
00:10:35,154 --> 00:10:36,150
At home.

211
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:41,020
He'll be home next time, with me and the kids. Right, Jimmy?

212
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,020
Jimmy loved that guy; he didn't kill him.

213
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,038
Now you're a mind reader...

214
00:10:51,073 --> 00:10:51,739
Maybe.

215
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,780
You want me to guess your weight?

216
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,500
You do and you could lose a tooth.

217
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,510
Booth, you've got to stay objective.

218
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,970
Jimmy was one of the last people to see Devon alive.

219
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,300
He admitted they went to the cemetery. Jimmy could've killed him.

220
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,510
Oh, here we go. I thought you didn't like speculation.

221
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,820
I don't. That's why I took this.

222
00:11:06,254 --> 00:11:09,130
Cigarette butt, to see if we can pull any DNA from it.

223
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,130
Match it to anything he left on Devon.

224
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,160
All right, if you got what you need, why are you giving me such grief?

225
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,260
Because... I thought you could've been a little tougher in there.

226
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,330
I'm tough.

227
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:19,380
Most of the time.

228
00:11:21,117 --> 00:11:23,670
Do you always have to get the last word in?

229
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,200
I like to, yeah.

230
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,730
Booth.

231
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,790
Son of a bitch.

232
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,990
Hank! Hey!

233
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,900
How the hell are you, man?

234
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,650
Oh, great; just got some new wheels.

235
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,470
Ah, sweet ride. Hank Lutrell, dr. Temperance Brennan.

236
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,650
Oh, the bone lady.

237
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,790
That's me.

238
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,280
Oh, I heard you two were working together.

239
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,340
Booth and I were in the same unit in Kosovo.

240
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,810
Hey, you've got to come over for dinner or Jennie and the kids'll keep asking about you.

241
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,490
Yeah, I'd love to. I'll call, we'll make it a date, okay?

242
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,500
Great, I gotta roll. I've got to be in court at 3:00.

243
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,420
They can't start without the judge.

244
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,560
Hey, uh, call me or I'm gonna kick your ass.

245
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:00,570
What happened to him?

246
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,320
He got hurt.

247
00:12:04,619 --> 00:12:08,780
There are signs of additional damage on c-1 at the base of the skull.

248
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,780
This mark couldn't have come from the assault inside the cranium.

249
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,090
I just think that you should be aware that Booth went through something over there.

250
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,800
So I'm not supposed to tell the truth?

251
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,970
Truth? It's opinion, Jack.

252
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,510
It looks like a dimple in the bone... could be genetic.

253
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,110
There were no WMDs. That's the truth.

254
00:12:24,145 --> 00:12:27,310
Every major intelligence agency in the world thought there were.

255
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,940
We should get magnifications of the area to determine what else could have caused it.

256
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,040
Are you defending what's going on over there?

257
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,470
No, mistakes were made... obviously.

258
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,880
Yeah, like establishing military bases over there

259
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,120
instead of investing a fraction of what this war costs into alternative energy projects.

260
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,540
Nothing is that simple.

261
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,200
To me, it is... we're ruled by the corporate oligarchy. Face it.

262
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,880
There's also some discoloration here.

263
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,990
You should do some scrapings to see what it might be.

264
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,450
You want to make the world a better place, Jack?

265
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:57,750
Try shutting your yap long enough to hear something other than the sound of your own voice.

266
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,076
Hey, where are you going?...

267
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:03,549
The scrapings?

268
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:06,000
Huh? Oh, yeah.

269
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:08,380
I thought we were having a good time.

270
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,480
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, dr. Brennan.

271
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,560
You've helped us with some casualties we never thought we'd be able to I.D.

272
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,390
Someday maybe I won't be needed.

273
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,380
That's what we all hope.

274
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,470
Captain Fuller, give agent Booth and dr. Brennan all the help they need.

275
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,240
Yes, sir. Please.

276
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,180
So this is your third tour in Iraq, captain?

277
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,320
Yes, a national guard unit can be difficult to lead.

278
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,030
Nothing against the guard, but usually they're inexperienced,

279
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,680
shortchanged on equipment.

280
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,810
But Kent's unit, they were one of the best I ever had.

281
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,750
And Devon Marshall?

282
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,730
Marshall was a good soldier.

283
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,640
But after he came back, he seemed to turn against the military,

284
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,610
saw us as the problem over there.

285
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,880
You must have known men like that.

286
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,200
Some people just aren't cut out for it.

287
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:55,310
Like Jimmy Merton.

288
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,330
Jimmy's been having some troubles, but he still supports us.

289
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,440
Both Marshall and Jimmy seem like

290
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,770
they had trouble getting over corporal Kent's death.

291
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,070
Any idea why it was so tough for them? I mean, tougher than usual?

292
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,280
We were on a patrol in Mosul.

293
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,770
Intel reports indicated there were insurgents in this neighborhood.

294
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,030
We were canvassing the area.

295
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,640
Private Campbell, she stayed in the humvee

296
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,230
as the unit headed toward a small house up the street.

297
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:26,120
There were five of us.

298
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:30,200
Kent, Marshall, Merton, Lefferts and myself.

299
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:32,890
It was a small house, two rooms.

300
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,050
I looked through a slat and saw three insurgents in the back room,

301
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,690
one a woman.

302
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,860
The men had AK-47s.

303
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,080
I sent Kent and Lefferts to cover the back, so no one could run.

304
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,980
I was getting the others into position

305
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,340
when one of the insurgents must have spotted Kent.

306
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,370
I heard the pop, pop, pop of the enemy AK-47.

307
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,190
Kent made entry to take them out before they could get to the rest of us.

308
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,460
Lefferts followed him in while we were kicking in the front door.

309
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,010
When we got to them,

310
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,610
Kent had already been killed taking out the insurgents.

311
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,500
A sight like that stays with you.

312
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,385
For two part-timers like that, I guess it was too much.

313
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,140
But whatever Marshall was trying to do, desecrating Kent's grave,

314
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,290
Kent saved the unit.

315
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,930
Marshall can't take that away.

316
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,060
Devon Marshall was murdered, captain.

317
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,430
God...

318
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,010
any bad blood between him and Jimmy Merton?

319
00:15:28,838 --> 00:15:29,867
Not that I know of.

320
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:32,830
We only have the after-action summary of the incident.

321
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,680
I'd like to have the full report, Kent's autopsy,

322
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,860
the photographs you took of the scene,

323
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,100
and any other evidence that exists.

324
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,090
You'll have whatever you need.

325
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,350
I thought we were keeping the murder to ourselves.

326
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,460
He's the company commander, Bones. He's a decorated officer.

327
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,370
And you think a soldier wouldn't kill someone?

328
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,220
Oh, suddenly it's your job to question the motives of

329
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,049
everyone who serves?...

330
00:15:54,084 --> 00:15:57,287
No, it's my job to solve a murder. Yours, too.

331
00:15:57,322 --> 00:16:01,280
Treat him like you would anyone else involved in an investigation.

332
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,550
You're not in the military anymore, Booth.

333
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,452
I will find out who killed Devon Marshall. That's all you need to know.

334
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:11,800
How's Booth doing?

335
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,660
He's angry.

336
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,050
I think I said some things.

337
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,370
Sweetie...

338
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:21,860
He wasn't being objective. I just had to get him to focus.

339
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,090
You have to think before you speak.

340
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,030
Why?

341
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,620
I can say anything to you without thinking about it first.

342
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,420
Yeah, men aren't like us.

343
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,310
They're much more fragile and needy.

344
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,270
The fact that they think we're the needy ones is a testament to our superiority.

345
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,660
Yeah, I guess I forgot.

346
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,500
Dr. Brennan, the military delivered all the paperwork you requested.

347
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,130
Private Kent's autopsy report is careless and incomplete.

348
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,440
There was no incision, no X-rays, so

349
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,310
there's no way to confirm the amount of bullets that he was hit with.

350
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:56,420
The ME Marked seven entry points, but the report says there were only six bullets.

351
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,110
I could've done better with a crayola.

352
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,860
Medical records are done on the fly in combat situations.

353
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,470
That doesn't mean that they're falsified.

354
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,780
Booth, the report is a mess.

355
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,620
Ange, I'd like you to input these photographs

356
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,800
and enhance them for as much detail as possible.

357
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,660
I couldn't salvage much flesh from Marshall's ear

358
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,370
but I'm sending anything useful up to pathology

359
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,850
to see if they can match anything with the DNA they pulled from Jimmy Merton's cigarette.

360
00:17:19,766 --> 00:17:21,520
Were you really mad before?

361
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,550
Why, because of your strident, paranoid ramblings?

362
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,990
I'm guessing mad. Fair enough.

363
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,390
Can I at least give you some material to read?

364
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,570
You could try.

365
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,180
But you'd walk funny for a week.

366
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,600
I'd better work on these scrapings for Zack.

367
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,550
This is a murder.

368
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,800
We know Devon would visit Kent's grave, Jimmy said, to apologize.

369
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,020
He knew something about Kent, Booth.

370
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,620
Something these reports will never tell us.

371
00:17:50,013 --> 00:17:51,690
So what do you want to do?

372
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,628
I want to exhume Charles Kent.

373
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:57,110
Exhume a war hero? Do you have any idea what you're asking?

374
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,672
It's the only way we'll realy know what happened to him.

375
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:00,326
You have the report...

376
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:02,282
Which is sloppy and incomplete.

377
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:05,810
He is supposed to be honored this week, Bones, not humiliated.

378
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:09,730
Doesn't Devon Marshall deserve as much respect and honor as Kent?

379
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,150
I'm sorry, Bones, I can't let you do this.

380
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,690
I'm not asking for your permission, Booth.

381
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,570
I can get the court order on my own.

382
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,190
I was just kind of hoping for your support.

383
00:18:33,052 --> 00:18:35,520
Agent Booth, I'm Tina Kent.

384
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,880
Yes, ma'am, I'm very sorry.

385
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:02,670
You know, this is his silver star...

386
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:07,470
I know how much you hate this, Booth.

387
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,470
Let's just get it over with, all right?

388
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:15,670
Okay, I want a full set of X-rays and a clear picture of all fracture patterns.

389
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,920
And a tox screen and analysis of any particulates in the wounds.

390
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:22,110
DOD wants this done fast. They want this out of the press as soon as possible.

391
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,940
It will take the time it takes to do properly.

392
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,140
Can you run scenarios on the angles and the entry order of the shots?

393
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,450
Yeah, I should be able to give you something.

394
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:34,610
I know we don't see eye to eye on a lot of stuff, because, you know,

395
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,526
politically, I think we live in an orwellian nightmare, due to...

396
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:40,740
What... what are you trying to say?

397
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:47,280
Just... I'm sorry, man. I really am.

398
00:19:53,263 --> 00:19:57,880
Only X-ray with I-1 through 4 and the left scapula.

399
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,080
Ah, he's just a kid.

400
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,180
It's always the young.

401
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,630
Anthropologists have theorized that wars break out

402
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:09,440
when there's an increase in the population of unmarried men under the age of 25

403
00:20:11,674 --> 00:20:13,090
I'm sorry.

404
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,170
I need to create a distance from the victim. It's how I deal;

405
00:20:16,994 --> 00:20:17,724
I didn't mean...

406
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,910
Just... you know what, do what you have to do. I'm going to go do my thing.

407
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,590
I- I-I should've been with Kent.

408
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,760
M- maybe I could've shelded him, you know?

409
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,400
But-but the captain, he put me and Devon on the front door.

410
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,400
By the time we got to Kent, it-it was too late.

411
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,530
And what did you see from where you were?

412
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,540
Oh, no, come on, man; I don't need to go through that again.

413
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,930
Okay, the captain told you.

414
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,340
You read the report.

415
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,750
Come on, Jimmy.

416
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,660
Please. All right? This is for Kent. And Devon.

417
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:58,660
It was the first action we saw.

418
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,056
Man, nobody was ready.

419
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:07,130
We were outside the front door, sweating in the heat, just waiting.

420
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,830
What was the first thing you heard?

421
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:13,780
First... was the pop, pop, pop from the enemy AK-47.

422
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,840
Then all hell broke loose.

423
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,030
We broke down the door, we made entry,

424
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:23,260
and those people, the iraqi ones, they were already dead when we got to the back room...

425
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,010
Kent, too.

426
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,540
Lefferts, standing over him all freaked.

427
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,870
Man, we were all freaked, man.

428
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,910
These were real people, you know?

429
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,388
Did you see them firing on Kent?...

430
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:35,601
No.

431
00:21:35,636 --> 00:21:40,150
But like I said, it took time to kick in the door and push through to the back room.

432
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,850
If I got there faster, I'd...

433
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:47,210
there was nothing I could do, you know?

434
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,810
I swear.

435
00:21:51,864 --> 00:21:54,920
The X-rays show that six of the bullets are still in the remains.

436
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:58,040
I need to see which entries were fatal. Anything more on Devon Marshall?

437
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,760
We're still working on the bone dimple in his neck.

438
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,050
Okay, set up a tray so we can start extracting the bullets.

439
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,860
Did you find anything in the wounds

440
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,380
that might have changed the trajectory of the bullets?

441
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,560
Not yet.

442
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,180
Just residual sesquioxide and silica accumulation,

443
00:22:15,621 --> 00:22:19,560
a little decayed organic matter, probably food that was on the floor. So...

444
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,890
Thank you.

445
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,350
Look, Angela...

446
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:26,180
I run on sometimes, I know.

447
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:29,180
I guess I think if I yell loud enough, maybe someone will listen.

448
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,090
Yeah, you have to be careful people don't go deaf.

449
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:38,090
You know, what you did for Booth before,

450
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,030
showing him you understood?

451
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,710
That was good.

452
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,010
Everyone hears something like that.

453
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,250
I joined the guard 'cause they helped pay for medical school.

454
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,760
All my life, I wanted to be a doctor.

455
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,940
That's all I ever wanted.

456
00:23:01,822 --> 00:23:05,270
I never thought I'd get sent overseas, much less Iraq.

457
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,240
Your service record is exemplary.

458
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,480
I survived.

459
00:23:12,488 --> 00:23:14,530
That's my achievement.

460
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,230
Look, I'm sorry to do this, ms. Campbell,

461
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:21,860
I'm just trying to reconstruct the night of the firefight.

462
00:23:27,212 --> 00:23:29,360
I was parked in the alley.

463
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,830
The captain told me to stay in the humvee...

464
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,648
women aren't supposed to engage in direct combat.

465
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:39,440
He took the unit to the house.

466
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,270
The street was quiet. I was waiting,

467
00:23:42,645 --> 00:23:46,130
then I heard the "pop, pop, pop"of the AK-47.

468
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,860
Then Kent and Lefferts firing.

469
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,440
The captain and the others breaking down the door.

470
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,830
Then everything stopped...

471
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:57,620
and went quiet again.

472
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,680
Then the captain came back, told me Kent had been hit.

473
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:05,360
He knew I was a med student, so he sent me in while he radioed for a medevac.

474
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,330
As an intern...

475
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,780
I've seen a lot of horrible things...

476
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,880
but when it's your friend...

477
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,430
someone you serve with...

478
00:24:28,656 --> 00:24:32,650
Been in the guard for years- didn't think I'd ever get called up again. I mean, I'm 45.

479
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,140
Just not enough men for this mess.

480
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:39,410
Look, mr. Lefferts, if we could just...

481
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:53,010
We were 22 hours into a 12-hour detail.

482
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,360
You try that when it's a 110 degrees out.

483
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,620
They called me "dad" because I was the old guy.

484
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,480
Kent was the kid. Captain sent us around back.

485
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,310
I was supposed to look out for him.

486
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,850
It got like I really was the damn kid's father.

487
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,860
Kent was gung-ho, you know?

488
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,730
Would've fought the whole damn war himself.

489
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:22,000
So... he sees something move inside.

490
00:25:22,682 --> 00:25:23,970
Something shines off the light...

491
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,920
a barrel, he says.

492
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,560
Then we hear people moving around,

493
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:31,600
somebody coming towards us from inside.

494
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,640
Then somebody fires.

495
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,910
What did it sound like... the shots?

496
00:25:36,632 --> 00:25:38,320
It was like a "pop, pop, pop".

497
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:43,490
Then Kent rushes in, sees the first guy, blows him away.

498
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,490
Wasn't supposed to go in by himself,

499
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:51,320
so I rush in and I take out the last guy. And then it all stops.

500
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,330
And when it does...

501
00:25:54,884 --> 00:25:56,760
Kent is lying there.

502
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:03,100
I can't believe it. I'm-I'm-I'm... staring down at Kent...

503
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,890
and then the others, they ask,"what happened, dad?"

504
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,140
"Dad, what happened?"

505
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:16,830
And I'm... and I'm staring down at Kent like he really is my kid.

506
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,930
I'm a lawyer!

507
00:26:22,856 --> 00:26:25,000
A damn lawyer.

508
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,300
I shouldn't have been there.

509
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,680
None of us should've been there.

510
00:26:35,556 --> 00:26:36,820
Their stories don't line up.

511
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,730
You said the events seem consistent.

512
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,920
Exactly. We've got a group of traumatized soldiers

513
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,977
who all managed to say the same words to describe the first shots:

514
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,060
"Pop, pop, pop". It was rehearsed.

515
00:26:48,683 --> 00:26:49,285
They're hiding something...

516
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,380
That makes sense.

517
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:55,610
Something Devon knew about.

518
00:26:55,999 --> 00:26:58,187
Yeah, and someone else didn't want to get out.

519
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,170
That's all of them.

520
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,310
The way the blood pooled around the bullets,

521
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,480
these three were the ones that killed him.

522
00:27:10,139 --> 00:27:12,710
But these rounds aren't from an AK-47.

523
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,480
These are.

524
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:17,460
Well, they didn't kill him; circulation had stopped by the time these bullets hit.

525
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,320
Right, the ones that killed him were from an M-14... 14.

526
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,230
Those... are from our weapons.

527
00:27:25,732 --> 00:27:26,900
Friendly fire.

528
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,810
Oh, God.

529
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,980
Booth...

530
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,740
You know what? Let's just find out who did this, all right?

531
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,770
Not all personnel in a unit carry the same weapons.

532
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,430
We have to find out who was issued the M-14.

533
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,240
Lefferts was the only one issued an M-14.

534
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:50,810
So Kent runs into the house firing, the insurgents fire back.

535
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:55,950
Lefferts follows Kent in, Lefferts is shooting and he kills Kent.

536
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:58,330
And Devon wanted to tell the truth, but Lefferts, you know,

537
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,690
he's got a successful legal practice, too much to lose.

538
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:03,150
Lefferts kills Devon.

539
00:28:25,085 --> 00:28:26,770
"I shot Kent that night.

540
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,920
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to, but I can't live with it anymore".

541
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,880
His assistant says he was out of town the night that Devon Marshall died.

542
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,150
He couldn't have killed him.

543
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:41,820
The murderer is still out there, Booth.

544
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,930
Devon Marshall was too badly burned.

545
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,490
Hodgins couldn't get enough usable tissue to match the DNA from Jimmy Merton's cigarette.

546
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,270
So the one person who had a motive killed himself,

547
00:28:55,002 --> 00:28:56,300
but he couldn't have killed Marshall.

548
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,150
The M.E. confirm suicide?

549
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,570
Yeah. Plus, no one was in or out of the office.

550
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,160
He definitely killed himself.

551
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,250
But we still have no idea who killed Devon Marshall.

552
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,310
Agent Booth?

553
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:12,710
Mr. Kent.

554
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:15,410
This is dr. Brennan.

555
00:29:15,936 --> 00:29:17,340
I know.

556
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:20,860
I'm sorry I exhumed your son, sir, but we needed...

557
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,020
No, please, thank you.

558
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,740
It's important for us to find out how he died.

559
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,880
You want to sit?

560
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,060
No.

561
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,460
I- I just wanted to ask...

562
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:35,680
There are so many conflicting stories. Now the captain says he can't talk to us.

563
00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:38,680
I just wanted to ask you to find the truth.

564
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,520
My wife and I can't live not knowing what happened to Charlie.

565
00:29:43,627 --> 00:29:45,520
We need the truth.

566
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:48,140
Of course.

567
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,920
I can't talk to the family. There's an ongoing investigation.

568
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,715
That's convenient.

569
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,199
Bones...

570
00:29:58,234 --> 00:29:58,649
What?

571
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,880
And you had no idea this was a friendly fire incident?

572
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,960
If I had, don't you think I would have reported it?

573
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:06,510
There are so many inconsistencies in the report, captain, it just seems like...

574
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,230
You're good at your job, dr. Brennan,

575
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,520
but you don't know the first thing about combat.

576
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:14,500
We were taking fire, one of my men was killed, the area wasn't secured.

577
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,320
Do you think I'm counting bullets and drawing pictures?

578
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,890
You've been through it.

579
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,180
Does it ever go the way you want it to?

580
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,620
Is it ever the way it should be in combat?

581
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,840
We have to ask these questions, it's a murder investigation.

582
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,877
You understand that?...

583
00:30:27,912 --> 00:30:29,769
And I'll cooperate any way I can.

584
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:34,680
I don't want any more of my men to die, either. Now, if there's nothing else?

585
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,980
Got something.

586
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,700
A splinter pattern.

587
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,400
Particles of wood were blown back into one of the exit wounds from the AK-47s.

588
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,590
The missing bullet.

589
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,870
But he wasn't leaning against wood when he was shot.

590
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,060
He was in the middle of the room.

591
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,820
No, he was on the floor.

592
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,470
Someone stood over him

593
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:59,960
and squeezed off some rounds from an AK-47 after he was already dead.

594
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,200
The missing round passed through him and into the wood floor.

595
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,860
Yeah, but all the insurgents had already been killed.

596
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,580
And they were the only ones with the AK-47s.

597
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,390
I hate to say "conspiracy," but, my peeps,

598
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,050
we've got a conspiracy.

599
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,610
Someone wanted to cover up the friendly fire incident

600
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,340
by making it look like he was killed by the insurgents.

601
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:23,520
Angela, enhance all the pictures of the aftermath so we can see

602
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,890
body positions, bullet holes, damage to the house.

603
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,460
I want to reconstruct what happened that night.

604
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,960
Look at the two of us.

605
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,770
You with a badge, me in the courtroom. Both trying to find justice.

606
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,470
That's why we fought, right?

607
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,650
That's what they told us.

608
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,100
What, you don't believe it?

609
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,380
Sure I do.

610
00:31:45,726 --> 00:31:47,540
You don't look like you do.

611
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,920
You're not gambling again, are you?

612
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,280
No, man. No, I've been good.

613
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,430
You know, I've been going to my meetings.

614
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,010
Haven't even played a game of monopoly.

615
00:31:57,722 --> 00:32:01,200
Hey, listen, hank, um, I got this case.

616
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,060
Charles Kent.

617
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,900
Uh... it was friendly fire.

618
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,350
Oh, God.

619
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,100
Yeah. Covered up.

620
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,270
Two other members of the squad are dead. One murdered.

621
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,950
You know, whatever went down must have been pretty ugly.

622
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,150
Hey...

623
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,520
you know, Hank,

624
00:32:22,614 --> 00:32:25,590
you know what, uh, you know what- what we did?

625
00:32:26,263 --> 00:32:27,990
Don't go there, Booth.

626
00:32:28,428 --> 00:32:30,200
Was it worth it? I mean, look at you.

627
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,080
You saved my life. I got a great family because of you.

628
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,590
Yeah, but, I mean, why was it always secret?

629
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,610
We were given a choice.

630
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,980
They always gave us a choice.

631
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,450
Yeah, but that last time...

632
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,890
Well... you knew what was at stake.

633
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,590
Yeah, yeah.

634
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,900
You never talked to anybody about it?

635
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,270
You've got to.

636
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,940
How about your girlfriend, that doctor?

637
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,190
No. You know, she's... you know, she's just my partner.

638
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,400
You know, look, I... I got work. I should go.

639
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,050
Sure.

640
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:10,280
Uh, we're on for Sunday dinner, right?

641
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,160
Yeah. Okay. Sunday.

642
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,760
I want to see all the walls.

643
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,070
Can you scan them for bullet holes?

644
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,640
Okay, single out the ones that came from Lefferts' weapon.

645
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:28,140
This is hard for Booth. He's idealistic.

646
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,080
Oh. It's nice to know somebody that wants to keep honor and responsibility alive.

647
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,840
I feel like Booth thinks I'm taking that away from him.

648
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,620
Okay, it says, insurgent a opened fire

649
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:44,410
when he saw Kent, and Kent took him out. Let's see A again.

650
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,530
You're just doing your job. He knows that.

651
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:50,880
I guess. Magnify his hands.

652
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,400
What are you looking for?

653
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:58,050
Well, his hands are splayed like he was shielding himself from the rounds coming at him.

654
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:02,470
Cadaveric spasm. The muscles became rigid when he died.

655
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,150
He might not have been holding that weapon.

656
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,480
What do you mean?

657
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,950
Show me insurgent B.

658
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,020
I tell Booth we're on the same side.

659
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:16,750
I'm not the one who's disillusioning him. It's my findings.

660
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,410
But when I look at him, I...

661
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,650
...I don't know what else I can do.

662
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,440
I do.

663
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,550
Ange...

664
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,260
As a friend, Brennan.

665
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,470
Yeah, that whole friends with benefits thing... that's...

666
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,180
that's not happening.

667
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,570
I'm not talking about that.

668
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:37,630
I'm- I'm talking about being there for him,

669
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:42,870
knowing when a- a simple touch is enough.

670
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:47,560
Maybe I could write him a note. I can be very articulate on paper.

671
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,750
Zoom in.

672
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:54,370
Okay, magnify the blood smear.

673
00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:59,130
Well, you can see by the smear he was moved, turned,

674
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,140
that gun placed next to him.

675
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,530
Okay, show me C.

676
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:08,450
Okay, this is the third insurgent woman, about 40,

677
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,840
holding the unexploded grenade in her hand.

678
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,260
Magnify her torso.

679
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,890
Wait. She's lying on a dinner plate.

680
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:24,290
The serving spoon is next to her. She'd been holding it when she was shot.

681
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,190
And a grenade?!

682
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,380
Found anything yet?

683
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,520
Yeah.

684
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,160
None of these people were armed when Kent went in there.

685
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,930
All of the weapons were planted on them after they died.

686
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:38,850
Fuller's unit killed an unarmed family.

687
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,300
Kent shot unarmed people?

688
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:48,340
They look like a family... About to sit down to dinner.

689
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,230
Were there any other questionable operations with this unit?

690
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:54,080
None. They served another six months without incident.

691
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,040
How could something like this have happened?

692
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,930
Woman could've heard him. She was on her way to the back door.

693
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:00,260
Kent probably thought the spoon was a weapon.

694
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,620
A spoon?!

695
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,160
It's dark. It happens.

696
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,720
He's inexperienced, he's scared out of his mind.

697
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,590
You only have an instant to make a choice.

698
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,130
Kent probably thought he was being attacked, so he burst through the door.

699
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,400
From the spray pattern, he was shooting as he entered.

700
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,930
He must've killed the woman first, the others as they rushed to the woman to help.

701
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:22,420
He probably thought they were attacking, too. Lefferts hears all the firing,

702
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:28,500
he goes in. Kent turns, weapon still pointed, Lefferts shoots, killing Kent.

703
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:30,750
It all happens in seconds.

704
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,460
But if Kent turned to face him...

705
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,080
It doesn't matter. I mean, after all the shooting,

706
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,320
all Lefferts sees is a weapon pointed right at him.

707
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,030
He just reacted.

708
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,942
God...

709
00:36:40,977 --> 00:36:41,734
Yeah.

710
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,470
So this was more than a friendly fire incident.

711
00:36:46,185 --> 00:36:48,080
Hell of a lot more.

712
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,880
You son of a bitch! You covered up the whole thing.

713
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,060
Stand down, agent Booth.

714
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:54,920
They were innocents.

715
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,349
I don't know what you've heard, but my report clearly states...

716
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:58,950
We've taken your report apart.

717
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,940
We have the facts, captain. Your squad blew away a family of innocents!

718
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,980
Kent! Kent did!

719
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,830
A kid so green he never should've been there in the first place.

720
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,940
Do you know what that town was like?

721
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,650
Our guys were getting blown up by IEDs every day

722
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,730
while we were trying to build hospitals and schools.

723
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,680
A mistake was made.

724
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,500
No one likes it.

725
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,560
But you know it happens.

726
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,030
If it got out what we did,

727
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,360
that neighborhood, the whole damn city, would've exploded.

728
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,710
What would you have done?

729
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,090
Would you have let the city burn?

730
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,590
This can't come out, agent Booth.

731
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,430
Don't make this any harder, with an ugly story like this.

732
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:40,210
I don't know what you're fighting for, Fuller,

733
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,270
but it sure as hell wasn't my country.

734
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,120
We'll start with obstruction of justice.

735
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,483
You have no jurisdiction on this base...

736
00:37:46,518 --> 00:37:48,119
But we do, captain.

737
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,760
And we're cooperating fully with agent Booth.

738
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,620
You will not disgrace us, captain. You will be held accountable.

739
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,810
Devon Marshall's killer is still out there.

740
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,910
Fuller placed some confiscated weapons on the Iraqis,

741
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:07,440
pressured the others to be quiet, but he still has an alibi

742
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,780
for the night of Marshall's murder.

743
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:13,190
Zack found some discoloration on Devon's vertebra.

744
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:17,350
It was caused by residue left from pethidine, an opiate affectionately known as demerol.

745
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:24,050
Someone jabbed a syringe into his neck, creating the indentation in the bone.

746
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,250
He would have been unconscious in seconds.

747
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,930
That's why the instrument could have been

748
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,850
placed into his ear without a struggle.

749
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,370
It was a nine-inch surgical curette like this.

750
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,120
So we're looking for someone with access to surgical tools and prescription drugs.

751
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,560
Someone the army sent to medical school.

752
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,280
All done.

753
00:38:56,654 --> 00:38:58,530
He was going to tell.

754
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,720
I...

755
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,860
it's like the war was still going on. I was just trying to survive.

756
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,790
Forward, march!

757
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,560
My boy was just trying to do the right thing.

758
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:42,570
Thank you for letting people see that.

759
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,220
You can be proud of him.

760
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,940
I would never have expected to see that.

761
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,320
Well, people always surprise you.

762
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,070
That hasn't always been my experience.

763
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,120
I've done some things.

764
00:40:20,831 --> 00:40:21,600
I know.

765
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,870
No, no, you don't.

766
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:26,850
But it's okay.

767
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:30,200
Well, not... nots a secret.

768
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,310
It's not.

769
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:38,470
I have to be, uh... honest... about myself.

770
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,070
I- I- I have to be able tell someone.

771
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,740
You will in time, Booth.

772
00:40:48,023 --> 00:40:49,220
You will.

773
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:57,890
I was sent to Kosovo.

774
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:03,500
There was this serb general... Radik...

775
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:10,010
who led a unit... who would go into villages and, you know, destroy them.

776
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,680
Women, children, all...

777
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,340
all killed because he wanted to ethnically purify his country.

778
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:21,390
He'd done this twice before. I mean, we had facts. Proof.

779
00:41:22,312 --> 00:41:28,420
232 people... just erased.

780
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:32,400
I was the... sniper...

781
00:41:35,432 --> 00:41:37,960
sent in to stop him.

782
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:42,150
He was set to leave in a couple of hours.

783
00:41:44,191 --> 00:41:48,490
It was his son's... son's birthday.

784
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,980
A little boy,

785
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,440
maybe about six or seven.

786
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:59,690
I can still hear the music from the party, you know, that song is just...

787
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,680
just playing in my head. Nobody knew where the shot came from,

788
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:08,040
but, you know, they knew why it came.

789
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:13,080
They said I saved over a hundred people... but,

790
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,130
you know, that little boy,

791
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:23,000
who didn't know who his father was, who just... who just loved him...

792
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:29,080
he saw him die... fall to the ground...

793
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,360
right in front of him.

794
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:39,320
That little boy, all covered with his daddy's blood.

795
00:42:41,951 --> 00:42:45,120
Just changed forever.

796
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:53,230
It's never just, it's never just the one person who dies, Bones... never, never.

797
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:08,090
We all die a little bit, Bones.

798
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:13,220
With each shot, we all die a little bit.
