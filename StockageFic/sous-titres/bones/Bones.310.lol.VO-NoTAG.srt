1
00:00:09,325 --> 00:00:11,303
The GPS says it's right up here.

2
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:14,709
You don't even know
how to use that thing.

3
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:16,305
The hell I don't.

4
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:18,064
We're here.

5
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:20,929
We just drove an hour through the woods

6
00:00:21,372 --> 00:00:24,217
to find more woods that look just like
the woods we drove through.

7
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:26,858
Eureka.

8
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:28,823
That's mud.

9
00:00:28,983 --> 00:00:30,867
No, this is like, um...

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,883
- Yeah, it's pretty much mud.
- And it smells like rotten eggs.

11
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:36,456
Mmm, sulfur.

12
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,409
Very therapeutic.

13
00:00:39,323 --> 00:00:41,670
And you expect me to believe
you've never been here before?

14
00:00:42,358 --> 00:00:44,870
A friend of mine told me about
this place and swore me to secrecy,

15
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,501
but this is my first time.

16
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:47,852
In mud.

17
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:51,638
Come on in. It's nice.

18
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:52,983
All right.

19
00:01:06,168 --> 00:01:07,308
Something's poking me.

20
00:01:07,428 --> 00:01:10,215
This mud is reputed to have
amazing romantic properties.

21
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:14,855
I think I got it.

22
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:17,117
No, I think I'd notice if you got it.

23
00:01:23,825 --> 00:01:25,305
Whoa, geez.

24
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:29,691
This hot spring averages
a temperature of 105 degrees,

25
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:33,296
but it can spike to near boiling,
which is why we discourage bathers.

26
00:01:33,716 --> 00:01:35,327
Especially those who illegally

27
00:01:35,447 --> 00:01:37,936
drive 4x4 vehicles into
a national park.

28
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:39,561
So someone was boiled to death?

29
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:42,230
Or had a heart attack
or passed out, etcetera, etcetera.

30
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:44,315
The remaining flesh
will have to be macerated.

31
00:01:44,475 --> 00:01:45,604
What's that?

32
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:46,966
Don't ask.

33
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:51,079
The flesh either has to be boiled off
or eaten by dermestid beetles.

34
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:52,823
Why can't you just say "cleaned"?

35
00:01:52,984 --> 00:01:55,260
The sulfur encrusted the bone.
You see the staining?

36
00:01:55,585 --> 00:01:57,746
- It's been there a long time?
- Not necessarily.

37
00:01:57,906 --> 00:01:59,080
Why do you bring it up?

38
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,999
Signs of blunt force trauma.

39
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,168
- What's that mean?
- That means he didn't pass out

40
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:04,711
and boil to death on his own.

41
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:07,254
- I'm going to need all of the mud.
- Excuse me?

42
00:02:07,415 --> 00:02:09,589
Get a tanker truck out here,
and suck it up,

43
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:11,557
so we can filter it back
at the Jeffersonian.

44
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:15,907
Humerus is 36.5 centimeters.

45
00:02:16,842 --> 00:02:18,077
Medium build.

46
00:02:18,252 --> 00:02:20,434
Late 20s, early 30s.

47
00:02:21,393 --> 00:02:22,912
He's broken this bone before.

48
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:24,439
Is she serious about the mud?

49
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,832
Serious as a gas attack.

50
00:02:26,018 --> 00:02:28,317
Heart attack, Bones.
Serious as a heart attack.

51
00:02:35,075 --> 00:02:38,268
The description's too general to get
anything from a missing person's report.

52
00:02:38,388 --> 00:02:40,627
Triangular depression in the calvarium.

53
00:02:40,747 --> 00:02:42,985
Anterior longitudinal one fracture.

54
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:45,335
Grazed cortical bone in C1.

55
00:02:45,496 --> 00:02:48,265
There's a patterned impression
in the bone.

56
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:50,148
How many times was he hit, and by what?

57
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:53,927
More than once by a... square pipe?
Does that exist?

58
00:02:54,202 --> 00:02:57,324
In my experience, people hit people with
anything they can pick up and swing.

59
00:02:57,913 --> 00:02:59,224
He was attacked from behind?

60
00:03:00,218 --> 00:03:01,103
What?

61
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:03,102
There's a vertical impaction fracture to

62
00:03:03,263 --> 00:03:05,271
his glabella and frontonasal suture.

63
00:03:05,597 --> 00:03:07,539
- Same weapon?
- It doesn't appear so.

64
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,692
- I've seen this before.
- Really? Great. Where?

65
00:03:10,953 --> 00:03:14,046
From sharpened stone weapons
in "Neandertall" skeletons.

66
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,282
I'm thinking not so
relevant in this case.

67
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:19,786
The blow to the front of the head
would cause a severe laceration.

68
00:03:19,964 --> 00:03:21,878
There were no bloodstains
around the mud bath.

69
00:03:21,998 --> 00:03:24,569
Indicating the body
was dumped there postmortem.

70
00:03:25,243 --> 00:03:27,376
- Regarding the Neanderthals...
- "Neandertalls."

71
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,255
What was the context of those killings?

72
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:33,087
Accepted scenarios indicate
a single individual attacked

73
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:34,758
by two or more assailants.

74
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:38,478
Then we're looking for two
or more murderers.

79
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:13,882
We not sure about time of death.

80
00:04:14,043 --> 00:04:16,918
- It was definitely a murder.
- Definitely. Probably two assailants.

81
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:18,446
What a shock for that couple?

82
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:21,329
I mean, they slide naked
into the hot mud bath

83
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:23,046
a skeleton hand pokes her in the...

84
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,056
Anus

85
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:26,783
What? It's a clinical term
for that part of the body.

86
00:04:26,903 --> 00:04:27,978
Dr. Brennan?

87
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,189
Agent Booth?

88
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,818
Would it be fair to say that
you use work

89
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,610
 to avoid confronting personal issues?

90
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:35,445
Why? Cause I don't want to talk about...

91
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:37,642
- The anus.
- You really like that word, don't you?

92
00:04:37,762 --> 00:04:39,908
Do you two discuss anything
that's not attached to work?

93
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:41,576
It's better than
talking about...

94
00:04:41,871 --> 00:04:43,703
- The anus?
- What is it with you two?

95
00:04:43,981 --> 00:04:45,233
Sweets could be right.

96
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:47,415
- We talk a lot about work.
- I talk about my kid.

97
00:04:47,576 --> 00:04:49,334
Because he was almost kidnapped.

98
00:04:49,495 --> 00:04:51,044
My father... we talk about him.

99
00:04:51,205 --> 00:04:53,420
Because Agent Booth
arrested him for murder.

100
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:56,549
Okay, what are you trying
to get at here?

101
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:00,052
Your inability to share
your personal lives.

102
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:02,388
- I thought that was obvious.
- Okay, that was snotty.

103
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:04,207
I don't respond well to snotty.

104
00:05:04,327 --> 00:05:06,684
After a case, sometimes...

105
00:05:06,844 --> 00:05:08,353
we have a drink or coffee.

106
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:10,313
Booth has pie. I don't like pie.

107
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:13,622
You-you really should just...
give it a chance.

108
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:15,697
- I find it too sweet.
- OK, there!

109
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:17,194
We talked about pie.

110
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:19,019
Nothing to do with work.

111
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:21,991
It is better when we discuss murder.

112
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:24,869
I'd like to see you guys
in a social situation.

113
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:26,625
A situation where work is taboo.

114
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:29,540
Are you going to send us to a restaurant
and watch through a one-way mirror?

115
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,023
I'm still not having pie.

116
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:33,460
No, an evening out
with my girlfriend and me.

117
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:37,215
- They need someone to buy them beer.
- You want us to go on a double date?

118
00:05:37,376 --> 00:05:40,643
Listen, why don't you just go on
Internet like all the rest of the kids?

119
00:05:40,763 --> 00:05:42,768
Okay, if it goes well,
I'll withdraw my concern.

120
00:05:42,888 --> 00:05:44,722
I'll release you back
into your environment.

121
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:46,343
What are we, brook trout?

122
00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:48,309
Fine.

123
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:52,229
Agent Booth?

124
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:55,732
Unless you think that's
too much to prove?

125
00:06:00,513 --> 00:06:02,406
Fine. I'll show him
I have nothing to prove.

126
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,074
Bring it on, Sweets.

127
00:06:09,364 --> 00:06:12,331
So far I have three old beer cans,

128
00:06:12,451 --> 00:06:14,476
an Indian arrowhead,

129
00:06:14,596 --> 00:06:18,107
73 cents in change

130
00:06:18,987 --> 00:06:20,466
and a partially melted Sharpie.

131
00:06:20,746 --> 00:06:22,649
The victim was braised like osso buco.

132
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:25,036
The flesh was falling off the bone.
I put time of death

133
00:06:25,156 --> 00:06:26,681
between ten days and two weeks.

134
00:06:26,842 --> 00:06:28,418
I found stress fractures

135
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:30,746
and degenerative changes
in the facet joints.

136
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:33,313
Fits with the hypertrophy
of the cervical muscles.

137
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:35,678
I found microscopic tearing.

138
00:06:35,798 --> 00:06:38,109
But he had to sustain this position

139
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:39,860
to cause that kind of wear and tear.

140
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,111
Death by yoga?

141
00:06:41,604 --> 00:06:43,603
- Is that skull ready for me?
- It should be ready.

142
00:06:43,723 --> 00:06:45,533
You can take it out of
the boiler any time.

143
00:06:45,821 --> 00:06:49,078
Or you could do that for me because
I will never, ever

144
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:50,093
do that.

145
00:06:50,213 --> 00:06:51,914
There are fractures of the pelvis,

146
00:06:52,074 --> 00:06:54,917
compression fractures
of thoracic and lumbar vertebrae.

147
00:06:55,077 --> 00:06:57,932
Multiple metacarpal
and metatarsal fractures...

148
00:06:58,052 --> 00:07:01,382
- What was he, a crash test dummy?
- The injuries to the vertebrae,

149
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:04,152
tibia, femur are consistent
with landing on the feet

150
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:06,564
after falling from ten to 20 feet.

151
00:07:06,684 --> 00:07:08,165
Like jumping out of a tree?

152
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:11,301
The damage to the scapula
and acromion resulted from a low fall

153
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:14,135
but forward movement from
between 16 to 20 miles per hour.

154
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:15,438
Falling off a bicycle?

155
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,732
These injuries are more recent.

156
00:07:17,893 --> 00:07:19,609
Fractured and scored patella

157
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:21,361
and torn retinaculum.

158
00:07:21,522 --> 00:07:23,279
Okay, even I didn't get that one.

159
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,916
Why would anyone want to kill him?

160
00:07:25,036 --> 00:07:27,366
Sounds like he was doing
a good enough job on his own.

161
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,787
Yes, okay, Dr. Sweets, I'll ask him.

162
00:07:30,948 --> 00:07:32,577
How is Wednesday night? Are you free?

163
00:07:32,697 --> 00:07:35,708
Oh, what, to have our big double
date with our psychiatrist?

164
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:39,254
Just one more evening and then maybe
we won't have to see him anymore.

165
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:41,889
Fine. Wednesday is fine. I can't wait.

166
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:43,585
Does he want me to get you a corsage?

167
00:07:43,705 --> 00:07:46,329
Wednesday is fine.
We'll meet you there.

168
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:48,221
Yeah, I'm looking forward
to meeting her.

169
00:07:49,444 --> 00:07:50,369
Okay, bye.

170
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,088
This might be fun.

171
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,273
His girlfriend works with tropical fish.

172
00:07:54,393 --> 00:07:55,853
- Tropical fish?
- Yeah.

173
00:07:56,014 --> 00:07:57,688
This is weird.
Where are we meeting?

174
00:07:57,848 --> 00:07:59,144
At their ceramics class.

175
00:07:59,558 --> 00:08:00,774
What? No. You're kidding.

176
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:02,572
Why would I be kidding?

177
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:04,825
He said it was a good
idea to have a common activity.

178
00:08:04,945 --> 00:08:05,789
Ceramics?

179
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:09,033
I thought the whole point of therapy
was to give us peace of mind,

180
00:08:09,193 --> 00:08:10,660
not drive us crazy.

181
00:08:11,236 --> 00:08:12,245
Hey, it's Angela.

182
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:14,956
- Hey, Angela.
- Hey.

183
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:17,224
I did a rendering of our victim's face.

184
00:08:17,344 --> 00:08:19,659
We're checking him against
any reports of missing persons.

185
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:21,445
Wait a second.
That's Tripp Goddard.

186
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:23,381
- Tripp Goddard?
- A motorcycle racer.

187
00:08:24,179 --> 00:08:26,092
I forget sometimes I'm talking to girls.

188
00:08:26,252 --> 00:08:29,896
That would explain the wrist
and neck injuries on Zack's report.

189
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:31,607
Have him confirm with dentals.

190
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:34,100
Yeah, I don't appreciate the "girls"
comment.

191
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:38,563
Tripp won a huge motorcycle race
about two weeks ago.

192
00:08:38,723 --> 00:08:39,988
That fits time of death.

193
00:08:40,108 --> 00:08:42,719
That would have been the
Super Grand Prix out in Virginia.

194
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:45,778
Tripp won in the final two laps
after some kind of accident

195
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:47,321
took out the front-runner.

196
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,011
Girls, huh?

197
00:09:00,536 --> 00:09:02,446
It's not about the machine,
it's about the man.

198
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:04,601
I mean, sure you need a great bike
but a great rider

199
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:06,465
on a crap bike is still gonna win.

200
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,468
Riders say it's about the rider,
mechanics say it's the machine.

201
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:10,952
You know what I say?
It's about whoever signs the paychecks.

202
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:12,263
And that would be you.

203
00:09:12,423 --> 00:09:14,474
Yes, it would, and don't forget it.
Excuse me.

204
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:15,880
FBI. Special Agent Booth.

205
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,311
This is here is Dr. Temperance
Brennan from the Jeffersonian.

206
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:20,104
We're looking for someone who's able

207
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:22,089
to tell us a little bit about
Tripp Goddard.

208
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:24,025
I'm Philippa Fitz.

209
00:09:24,185 --> 00:09:26,413
And Tripp rides for our family team,
Slam Bolt.

210
00:09:26,979 --> 00:09:28,595
- What did Tripp do?
- Who are you?

211
00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:30,188
Garth Jodrey. I'm a journalist.

212
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:31,449
MotoKneeScrapers. Com.

213
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:33,714
- What does that mean?
- Oh, racers, when they...

214
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:35,786
they lean real low into the corners,

215
00:09:35,946 --> 00:09:39,121
- their knees, they scrape the asphalt.
- That would explain his knee injuries.

216
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:42,043
No one has seen Tripp since
after the Super Grand Prix.

217
00:09:42,203 --> 00:09:43,252
Where did he go?

218
00:09:43,572 --> 00:09:46,130
After a big win,
he usually takes off in his truck and...

219
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,613
climbs mountains, swims oceans,
no one really knows for sure.

220
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:50,885
- Can I help you?
- Mr. Goddard is dead.

221
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,014
What? What happened?

222
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:56,978
We believe he was murdered.

223
00:09:59,411 --> 00:10:00,804
Who would kill Tripp?

224
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:02,351
I don't know.

225
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:04,193
Well, the fans loved him.

226
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:06,928
- Everybody else hated him.
- Get lost, Garth.

227
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:08,090
Daddy, please.

228
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,029
No, I want him out of here, Philippa.

229
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:15,743
Garth doesn't seem to think that
Tripp is the good ol'boy and you do.

230
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:18,162
- He's got his reasons.
- The wheelchair for one.

231
00:10:18,322 --> 00:10:20,650
- Tripp put him in that wheelchair?
- It was an accident,

232
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,451
during a race, a couple of years ago.

233
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:25,044
You can't honestly believe that
Garth had anything to do with this.

234
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:27,838
- I mean, how? He's in a wheelchair.
- With help, obviously.

235
00:10:27,998 --> 00:10:31,050
- When was the last time you saw Tripp?
- The victory party after the race.

236
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,303
I saw him get in his truck
and leave around midnight.

237
00:10:34,463 --> 00:10:37,473
Great. I'm going to need to know
the make, the model, the year,

238
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:40,976
- license plate of the truck.
- Anything you need, we're here.

239
00:10:41,137 --> 00:10:43,604
Just find the bastard
that did this to him.

240
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,937
Okay, that's Danny Fitz.

241
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:16,461
I would have loved to have decked
Tripp like that

242
00:11:16,581 --> 00:11:18,698
after our race, only I was in
a coma for a few days.

243
00:11:18,818 --> 00:11:19,824
Another Fitz?

244
00:11:19,944 --> 00:11:21,559
Lenny's son, Philippa's
twin brother.

245
00:11:21,907 --> 00:11:23,060
All right, watch this.

246
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:26,564
Danny's got the race in the bag.
Final lap, Tripp does that.

247
00:11:26,968 --> 00:11:29,400
A classic inside-out block pass.

248
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,675
- Is he allowed to do that?
- Only if it's an accident.

249
00:11:31,795 --> 00:11:33,154
Slam Bolt would've taken first

250
00:11:33,315 --> 00:11:35,948
and second against Flame-Spark
if Tripp hadn't clipped Danny.

251
00:11:36,108 --> 00:11:37,992
There's someone named Flame-Spark?

252
00:11:38,152 --> 00:11:40,703
Yeah, Flame-Spark Spark Plugs.
It's Slam Bolt's rival team.

253
00:11:40,863 --> 00:11:42,204
I saw a little daylight.

254
00:11:42,364 --> 00:11:44,602
It looked like Danny was going wide,
so I went for it.

255
00:11:45,254 --> 00:11:48,669
It is a bummer when somebody loses
the front of their bike like that, but,

256
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,457
- what are you gonna do?
- Danny had that race in the bag.

257
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,932
Tripp did the same thing
to you, didn't he?

258
00:11:58,557 --> 00:12:01,432
Well, I guess Tripp didn't learn
anything from the time he did it to me.

259
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,543
Danny Fitz...
was he at the victory party?

260
00:12:03,663 --> 00:12:04,970
Yeah, absolutely.

261
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,659
Brave face for the press.

262
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,814
Did Danny leave before or after Tripp?

263
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,387
- About the same time.
- What about you?

264
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:12,722
I took off right after.

265
00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:17,963
You're friend with Danny,
aren't you?

266
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,326
You mean are we good enough
friends to kill Tripp together?

267
00:12:21,737 --> 00:12:24,872
You know, I'm pretty sure I don't have
to say anything without a lawyer.

268
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:37,372
It's not going to work.

269
00:12:37,492 --> 00:12:38,260
What?

270
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,805
Dropping loud pieces of metal
to hurry me up.

271
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:44,308
I need the skull so I can compare tool
marks to potential murder weapons.

272
00:12:44,468 --> 00:12:46,218
You're gonna have to wait.

273
00:12:49,757 --> 00:12:53,526
Titanium, magnesium and heat-treated
boron particulates are embedded in

274
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:54,848
these skull fractures.

275
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:56,779
What?

276
00:12:56,939 --> 00:12:58,948
That's a unique and
exotic combination of metals

277
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:00,866
not found in any of these.

278
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:06,080
You know, it is possible that these
particulates aren't from the tool.

279
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,499
- I mean, not from the tool alone.
- I don't understand.

280
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:11,252
Handmade racing motorcycles
are made from these metals.

281
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:15,005
So the particles could have gone from
the bicycles to the tools to the victim.

282
00:13:15,165 --> 00:13:18,092
It's not a bi-cycle,
it's a motorcye.

283
00:13:18,252 --> 00:13:19,814
Bi-cycle. Two wheels.

284
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:21,224
The term applies.

285
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,584
Drop those.

286
00:13:25,134 --> 00:13:27,643
Drop them. I mean it, Zack.
Bombs away.

287
00:13:30,097 --> 00:13:32,631
- I don't know what that proves.
- It proves I don't handle irritation

288
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:33,919
as well as I'd like.

289
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,844
- Can I pick these up now?
- No.

290
00:13:38,674 --> 00:13:40,769
You can pick one up...

291
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:42,491
the most likely culprit.

292
00:13:42,651 --> 00:13:46,224
A narrow instrument, no more
than an inch caused the injuries.

293
00:13:46,344 --> 00:13:47,121
Okay.

294
00:13:47,544 --> 00:13:49,790
Strain... The crushing,

295
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,931
tearing, shearing...
equals the change in dimension

296
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:54,962
divided by the original dimension.

297
00:13:55,122 --> 00:13:57,381
I do bugs and slime;
I don't do arithmetic.

298
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:59,759
An elongated rod with...

299
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,970
this cross-section
is the most likely culprit.

300
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,021
Good.

301
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:06,098
Good job, Zack.

302
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:08,266
Am I king of the lab?

303
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,226
We both are.

304
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:13,351
Let's go tell Cam.

305
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,781
Okay, now that...
that's gotta hurt.

306
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:23,949
Wait. Here it comes again.
I mean, look at that.

307
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,918
Oh, watch it.

308
00:14:26,337 --> 00:14:28,932
Watch out. Watch out...
Ooh! Boom!

309
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,789
Let the record show that Agent Booth

310
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,832
is taunting my client by repeatedly
showing footage

311
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:35,252
of his traumatic accident.

312
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:37,713
Don't say accident, man.
Tripp did that to me on purpose.

313
00:14:37,873 --> 00:14:40,007
How fast were you going at
the time of your incident?

314
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:42,635
I don't know exactly.
I was accelerating through 160.

315
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:44,595
Tripp was accelerating faster.
See there?

316
00:14:46,215 --> 00:14:47,348
Again, with taunting.

317
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:49,475
Why was Tripp so much better than you?

318
00:14:49,635 --> 00:14:50,669
Taunting.

319
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,558
I'm not taunting, Mr. Smalls.

320
00:14:52,678 --> 00:14:54,563
I'm restating an objective fact.

321
00:14:54,723 --> 00:14:56,857
Tripp had a better bike.
He had maybe 20 horses on me.

322
00:14:57,017 --> 00:14:58,651
You get Tripp's bike now, right?

323
00:14:58,811 --> 00:15:01,237
- I didn't kill Tripp for his motocycle.
- Why did you kill him?

324
00:15:01,397 --> 00:15:03,197
Whoa. Full stop there, cowboy.

325
00:15:03,357 --> 00:15:04,762
Don't sweat it there, princess.

326
00:15:04,882 --> 00:15:07,298
All right, any other reason why
you'd want to get rid of Tripp?

327
00:15:07,418 --> 00:15:08,226
No.

328
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:12,494
Certain things you hide
make you look guilty.

329
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,525
A couple years back, Tripp was
going out with my sister.

330
00:15:16,645 --> 00:15:18,026
Cheated on her with a groupie.

331
00:15:18,146 --> 00:15:19,547
- It came to blows.
- Who won?

332
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:20,907
I did, for once.

333
00:15:21,027 --> 00:15:23,425
- Knocked him on his ass.
- And you defended her honor.

334
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:27,471
Danny and Philippa are twins.
They're very close.

335
00:15:27,631 --> 00:15:29,636
He cheated on your sister,
forced you to crash.

336
00:15:29,756 --> 00:15:33,310
How would you exactly describe
your relationship?

337
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,320
We were the best of friends.

338
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:36,646
As your lawyer,

339
00:15:36,807 --> 00:15:40,192
I must caution you that sarcasm
doesn't show up in the transcript.

340
00:15:40,352 --> 00:15:41,522
Best be avoided.

341
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:43,217
Look, I'm sorry Tripp's dead,

342
00:15:43,337 --> 00:15:45,197
but I'm not exactly grieving.
You feel me?

343
00:15:45,357 --> 00:15:47,032
Bones, he's not afraid of me at all.

344
00:15:47,306 --> 00:15:50,895
It's hard to scare someone who rides
around a track at 200 miles an hour.

345
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:53,440
Now her, I like.

346
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,250
- You want to go out sometime?
- Danny, restrain yourself.

347
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,878
- She doesn't want to go out with you.
- Let me speak for myself.

348
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:00,629
Murder suspect here, Bones.

349
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:05,183
The wound at the front of
the head or the back?

350
00:16:05,303 --> 00:16:06,702
- Back.
- It couldn't be both?

351
00:16:06,822 --> 00:16:07,593
No.

352
00:16:07,715 --> 00:16:10,938
The blow to the front of the head
was from a sharp tool.

353
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:13,011
Sharper than round,
but blunter than sharp.

354
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:15,185
- What?
- That actually made sense to me.

355
00:16:15,345 --> 00:16:17,730
You two have been spending way
too much time together.

356
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,716
Can you estimate the amount of force?

357
00:16:19,836 --> 00:16:21,775
In the back of the head,
length undetermined,

358
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:23,736
a width of 3.8 centimeters,

359
00:16:23,896 --> 00:16:25,821
approximately a thousand
pounds of force.

360
00:16:25,981 --> 00:16:26,919
So a lot.

361
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,039
Half a ton.

362
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:30,409
- Which is a lot.
- That actually isn't very much.

363
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:33,120
All right, now I'm back in
a physics class I want to ditch.

364
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,372
A boxer's fist can land with
double that force.

365
00:16:35,532 --> 00:16:36,999
A big, meaty fist in a glove.

366
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:40,478
Yeah, with a force spread out over a
hell of a lot more than 3.8 centimeters.

367
00:16:40,598 --> 00:16:43,631
Correct. It wouldn't take all that much
force to crush a skull with this.

368
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:47,301
So, we haven't eliminated anyone
from our list of suspects?

369
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:49,720
Plus, we don't know what
that's a cross-section of, and

370
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,557
we don't know what caused
the damage to the front of the face.

371
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:55,643
What exactly made you two come in here,
crowing "king of the lab"?

372
00:16:59,757 --> 00:17:03,593
I'm gonna go back and look at very small
things under my very large microscope.

373
00:17:06,097 --> 00:17:09,073
I can probably identify the type
of tool off this cross-section.

374
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:10,720
Do it and call Booth.

375
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,660
See if it's of any use to him.

376
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:16,642
Boys.

377
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,168
I don't have the weapon.
But I microwaved the fabric samples

378
00:17:21,328 --> 00:17:23,494
and used gas sensors to analyze...

379
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:25,994
All right, all right... Just, let's just
cut to the chase there.

380
00:17:26,114 --> 00:17:27,164
Okay, Mr. Wizard?

381
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:29,510
I have identified what
was on the victim's clothing.

382
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,261
I'll take anything at this moment.

383
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:33,555
- What is it?
- It's toluene.

384
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:36,008
It's a clear liquid
used to clean up oil.

385
00:17:36,128 --> 00:17:37,607
How is that supposed to help us?

386
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:39,630
Every mechanic in the world
uses that stuff.

387
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,855
I need a weapon, do you hear me?
A weapon.

388
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,734
You know, I'm feeling really
underappreciated today.

389
00:17:45,894 --> 00:17:48,170
All right, well, you know wh?
You can suck it up, buttercup.

390
00:17:52,356 --> 00:17:53,130
Toluene.

391
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,453
It's also excellent
for cleaning up blood.

392
00:17:55,573 --> 00:17:58,255
So, if you killed someone here,

393
00:17:58,768 --> 00:18:00,276
and they bled a lot...

394
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:03,836
The drain.

395
00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:07,381
Check this drain for blood.

396
00:18:07,622 --> 00:18:11,448
Blood suspended in toluene
might be testable for DNA.

397
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:13,076
Tell Hodgins he did a good job.

398
00:18:13,196 --> 00:18:15,555
I'll tell Hodgins
he did a good job if...

399
00:18:18,554 --> 00:18:19,753
I'm waiting.

400
00:18:35,637 --> 00:18:36,827
I hate when you do this.

401
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,579
Do wha You don't talk.

402
00:18:39,344 --> 00:18:41,623
Sometimes you hate when I talk,
so it's a double-edged sword.

403
00:18:41,783 --> 00:18:44,064
Bones doesn't mind
sitting in silence, do you?

404
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,487
I hate it.

405
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,644
- Why do you think that is?
- He gets bored.

406
00:18:47,764 --> 00:18:50,580
- You're right, I do, I get bored.
- You should see him on stakeouts,

407
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,262
He talks, and talks...

408
00:18:53,745 --> 00:18:55,429
Well, it's very interesting.

409
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,358
Is it always about work?

410
00:18:57,914 --> 00:18:58,924
No.

411
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:01,059
You're lying.

412
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:03,270
Oh, come on.
How do you know that?

413
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,065
I have special training in
how to tell when people are lying.

414
00:19:06,374 --> 00:19:07,392
Is that true?

415
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:09,218
See, if you were me, you would know.

416
00:19:12,472 --> 00:19:15,032
You're lying to protect your partner.
I understand that.

417
00:19:15,294 --> 00:19:18,202
But let's agree amongst ourselves
that this is a truth zone.

418
00:19:18,986 --> 00:19:20,773
Is something bothering you?

419
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:22,439
It's this whole...

420
00:19:23,104 --> 00:19:24,842
going on a date thing.

421
00:19:24,962 --> 00:19:26,005
It's not a date.

422
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:29,463
It's a social outing for the
purpose of professional evaluation.

423
00:19:29,623 --> 00:19:30,839
Come on! Ceramics?

424
00:19:31,163 --> 00:19:32,847
I'm not that kind of a guy, all right?

425
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:35,969
What do we say we go, you know,
bowling, or to a firing range,

426
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:37,211
or climbing a wall.

427
00:19:37,331 --> 00:19:38,931
Oh, right, something you're good at.

428
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:41,475
A movie! All right?
Or dinner, dinner and a movie.

429
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:43,644
Somewhere that I don't have
to make something.

430
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:46,956
What? What "Ooh"?

431
00:19:47,377 --> 00:19:49,399
Well, what Sweets would
do in this situation

432
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,399
is he'd jump on word usage.

433
00:19:51,671 --> 00:19:54,154
He's going to ask you why
you're resistant to "making."

434
00:19:54,801 --> 00:19:56,648
I jump on the semantics?

435
00:19:57,546 --> 00:19:59,924
That's a really
aggressive turn of phrase.

436
00:20:00,404 --> 00:20:02,079
Thanks for pulling focus there, Bones.

437
00:20:03,178 --> 00:20:05,124
"Pulling," is that an aggressive
word, too?

438
00:20:05,284 --> 00:20:07,000
Okay, what?
Did you two plan this?

439
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,418
Paranoia.

440
00:20:08,578 --> 00:20:10,234
That is paranoia.

441
00:20:10,354 --> 00:20:13,507
Since this is a truth zone,
I will tell you the truth.

442
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:15,843
We didn't plan anything.

443
00:20:18,422 --> 00:20:21,041
- You're telling the truth.
- He's guessing.

444
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:23,976
We're going to a ceramics class
and we're all going to make something.

445
00:20:25,512 --> 00:20:26,353
Time's up.

446
00:20:45,073 --> 00:20:47,278
Look, Sweets can't really
tell if someone's lying;

447
00:20:47,398 --> 00:20:49,279
I'm telling ya,
he's playing with our minds.

448
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:52,549
There's an area of study called
neurolinguistics which proposes that

449
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:56,085
that subconscious eye movements
and body language tell

450
00:20:56,205 --> 00:20:59,094
a well-trained observer
if a subject is lying.

451
00:20:59,214 --> 00:21:00,677
Yeah, well, I don't believe it.

452
00:21:01,665 --> 00:21:02,977
I don't believe it!

453
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:04,320
Is that Tripp's bike?

454
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:07,477
Looks like Danny's going
to finally get what he wants?

455
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:08,976
Do me a favor, son.

456
00:21:09,096 --> 00:21:11,732
Take it easy a couple times
around before you blast off.

457
00:21:12,143 --> 00:21:13,704
I know, Dad.
Ease into it.

458
00:21:13,824 --> 00:21:15,986
- Hey, can I get a picture?
- Yeah, let's get a picture.

459
00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:18,403
Look at that, Number one on
the Slam Bolt Racing Team...

460
00:21:18,523 --> 00:21:20,057
You've got to feel good about that.

461
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:22,159
I'm not talking to you without
my lawyer present.

462
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,702
That goes for all of us.

463
00:21:23,822 --> 00:21:25,662
Now, look, you...
you I can replace.

464
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:27,748
Do not wreck my bike.

465
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,138
Well, Lenny, I'm thinking your boy
isn't going to relax into this.

466
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:44,973
Well, Danny gets a chance

467
00:21:45,134 --> 00:21:47,392
to grab the brass ring,
he's gonna take it.

468
00:21:54,137 --> 00:21:55,317
Okay, watch this.

469
00:21:55,477 --> 00:21:58,070
He's going to decelerate right
before the turn and just

470
00:21:58,231 --> 00:21:59,705
slingshot right through it.

471
00:21:59,825 --> 00:22:01,365
I don't see the deceleration part.

472
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,431
Danny's down!
We got a rider down!

473
00:22:15,356 --> 00:22:16,921
Come on, let's get in there!

474
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:20,709
Get in there.

475
00:22:23,547 --> 00:22:24,658
No, Daddy.

476
00:22:25,757 --> 00:22:28,684
Yes, we're at the Belleville
Practice Track on Highway 64.

477
00:22:28,844 --> 00:22:30,342
Send an air ambulance now.

478
00:22:30,462 --> 00:22:32,271
There's been a motorcycle accident.

479
00:22:41,773 --> 00:22:43,657
- Where's your father?
- He's at the house.

480
00:22:43,817 --> 00:22:46,603
He's already had two heart attacks.
He doesn't need to be here for this.

481
00:22:46,723 --> 00:22:48,705
Seems like a crime to mess with
such a sweet bike?

482
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,080
Yeah, a crime like murder.

483
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:52,624
Right, I-I just meant
the bike itself, it's...

484
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,751
No, I get it. You like bikes.

485
00:22:55,047 --> 00:22:58,005
These rotors are laser-cut and
honed, very exact.

486
00:22:58,257 --> 00:22:59,423
Bend one just a little,

487
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:02,843
and when this baby gets to speed,
the rotor hits the brake pad, separates

488
00:23:03,003 --> 00:23:04,887
a little further and the next thing
you know...

489
00:23:05,007 --> 00:23:06,555
- We saw.
- So it couldn't have been an accident?

490
00:23:06,715 --> 00:23:08,807
You mean, "Oops, I stuck
a piece of metal through

491
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:10,976
this tiny hole and pushed
with all my might"?

492
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:12,561
So anyone could have done this?

493
00:23:12,963 --> 00:23:15,856
Anyone who was familiar with
motorcycles. And was a killer.

494
00:23:16,141 --> 00:23:19,276
- Why would anyone want to kill Danny?
- You can't be near the evidence.

495
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:20,829
I'm sorry.

496
00:23:21,354 --> 00:23:23,302
See what else you can find,
will you?

497
00:23:28,111 --> 00:23:29,786
Recovering ink traces on plastic

498
00:23:29,946 --> 00:23:32,083
and polymers is problematic, so

499
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,041
I am using a new technique.

500
00:23:35,865 --> 00:23:38,569
A little of the reagent eugenol and...

501
00:23:40,371 --> 00:23:41,553
Voilà!

502
00:23:41,673 --> 00:23:43,759
"E-S-apers Do Co."

503
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,427
Does that meaning anything to you?

504
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:48,054
- Korean restaurant?
- Unlikely.

505
00:23:48,276 --> 00:23:50,348
There are obviously missing letters.

506
00:23:50,508 --> 00:23:52,742
We need to place the consonants
most likely

507
00:23:52,862 --> 00:23:54,811
to appear with this configuration
of vowels,

508
00:23:54,971 --> 00:23:56,730
and vowels to consonants.

509
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,107
That is an enormous amount
of variables, Zack.

510
00:24:00,631 --> 00:24:02,560
E Snappers Doll Company.

511
00:24:03,295 --> 00:24:04,307
Don't think so.

512
00:24:04,427 --> 00:24:05,983
Free Newspapers Dot Com.

513
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:08,734
Keen Snapers Don't Come.

514
00:24:08,985 --> 00:24:10,370
Definitely not.

515
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,912
Knee Scrapers Dot Com.

516
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:13,856
Oh, my God.

517
00:24:14,647 --> 00:24:15,457
That's it.

518
00:24:15,762 --> 00:24:17,626
MotoKneeScrapers. Com.

519
00:24:17,786 --> 00:24:20,323
- How did you do that?
- Process of elimination.

520
00:24:20,443 --> 00:24:22,149
You realize I have
no idea what it means?

521
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:25,384
It's the Web site run by the journalist
that Tripp put in a wheelchair.

522
00:24:25,544 --> 00:24:27,886
So this man's pen was
found on the murder victim.

523
00:24:28,046 --> 00:24:31,943
Or it fell in the mud when
the body was dumped.

524
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:40,692
I'm enjoying this.

525
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:44,403
The last time I threw pots, I was in
Columbia with the Arhuaco Indians.

526
00:24:44,563 --> 00:24:46,822
The last time I did this,
I was in nursery school.

527
00:24:46,982 --> 00:24:48,899
Well, we love it.

528
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:50,611
Don't we, Lance?

529
00:24:50,796 --> 00:24:51,626
Yes.

530
00:24:51,746 --> 00:24:53,537
Well, I love my work.

531
00:24:53,697 --> 00:24:55,539
But I'm not gonna
talk about that right now.

532
00:24:55,699 --> 00:24:59,417
Even though we think a paraplegic
killed Tripp Goddard.

533
00:24:59,577 --> 00:25:00,863
That sounds fascinating.

534
00:25:04,598 --> 00:25:07,392
Dr. Sweets said that
you work with tropical fish.

535
00:25:07,512 --> 00:25:08,309
Yes.

536
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:09,764
I love fish.

537
00:25:10,096 --> 00:25:11,179
They're like people.

538
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:13,835
No. No, they're not, actually;

539
00:25:13,955 --> 00:25:15,684
people can't breathe under water.

540
00:25:16,939 --> 00:25:18,092
She's funny.

541
00:25:18,722 --> 00:25:20,420
I am? Wha...?

542
00:25:20,682 --> 00:25:23,191
- Why is that funny?
- I don't think she meant literally.

543
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,026
It's their eyes.

544
00:25:25,394 --> 00:25:26,903
You can tell so much from eyes.

545
00:25:27,063 --> 00:25:29,948
Well, in humans, a retinal scan is
as specific as a fingerprint.

546
00:25:30,294 --> 00:25:32,349
No, no, their souls.

547
00:25:32,982 --> 00:25:34,411
You can see their little souls.

548
00:25:36,586 --> 00:25:37,664
I don't understand.

549
00:25:37,824 --> 00:25:39,541
You believe that fish have souls?

550
00:25:39,701 --> 00:25:42,752
Yes. You can see it in their coloring.

551
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,405
It's a reflection of who they are.

552
00:25:44,525 --> 00:25:46,797
Their coloring has developed
over millennia as a way to deal

553
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:47,991
with predators.

554
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:49,867
April just means they're beautiful.

555
00:25:50,136 --> 00:25:51,636
Don't tell me what I mean, Lance.

556
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:53,432
I mean they have souls.

557
00:25:54,172 --> 00:25:55,079
Okay.

558
00:25:56,426 --> 00:25:57,809
Look what I'm making.

559
00:25:58,901 --> 00:26:00,604
- You've done this before.
- No.

560
00:26:00,764 --> 00:26:01,646
You have.

561
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:05,108
- You really think that's good?
- Yes. Very.

562
00:26:05,268 --> 00:26:06,616
Yours is good, too, April.

563
00:26:06,736 --> 00:26:08,190
I'm not talking to you.

564
00:26:10,174 --> 00:26:11,907
You think that's funny?

565
00:26:12,067 --> 00:26:14,668
- Are they fighting?
- Just focus on your pot there.

566
00:26:15,134 --> 00:26:16,703
I'm with patients, April.

567
00:26:16,863 --> 00:26:18,663
Oh, no, no patients tonight.

568
00:26:18,823 --> 00:26:21,458
Just us people making pots.

569
00:26:22,051 --> 00:26:24,169
You can't apologize for me, Lance.

570
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,954
- Can we please just move on?
- No.

571
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:29,341
I just... I meant...

572
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,510
I believe that all creatures...

573
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,887
people, fish, dogs...

574
00:26:34,132 --> 00:26:35,215
we're all connected.

575
00:26:35,335 --> 00:26:38,016
We all share the same stuff
that makes life so beautiful,

576
00:26:38,177 --> 00:26:39,405
and precious.

577
00:26:39,525 --> 00:26:41,685
On a quantum level, that's true.

578
00:26:41,805 --> 00:26:44,244
Although the word "stuff"
is not accurate.

579
00:26:45,485 --> 00:26:46,417
See?

580
00:26:47,366 --> 00:26:50,070
What? I have great
respect for your fish.

581
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:52,489
Admittedly,
I might relate to other things more.

582
00:26:52,837 --> 00:26:54,939
He kills about a
thousand people a night.

583
00:26:55,652 --> 00:26:56,826
In a video game, April.

584
00:26:56,986 --> 00:26:58,161
They're not real.

585
00:26:58,321 --> 00:26:59,662
Hey, Sweets, your, uh,

586
00:26:59,823 --> 00:27:01,164
thing there is droopy.

587
00:27:03,754 --> 00:27:05,216
Look at my horse!

588
00:27:05,954 --> 00:27:07,462
That's amazing, Agent Booth.

589
00:27:09,176 --> 00:27:10,382
Very impressive.

590
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,133
Yes, it is.

591
00:27:13,211 --> 00:27:15,003
Ooh, Bones, I'm sorry.

592
00:27:15,123 --> 00:27:16,238
Oh, geez...

593
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,016
Hey, Sweets, I apologize.

594
00:27:20,176 --> 00:27:22,394
This whole ceramic thing is great!

595
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:32,737
This is fun.

596
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:45,959
Tell you one thing, Sweets
didn't get any last night.

597
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:48,461
They're too young to
be in a serious relationship.

598
00:27:48,621 --> 00:27:51,712
In agrarian societies,
young couplings made sense.

599
00:27:52,241 --> 00:27:55,760
The partnership was
for survival, but today...

600
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,811
You know you can play the field,
and not plow it.

601
00:28:01,926 --> 00:28:03,686
- That was distasteful.
- What?

602
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:06,354
I liked April though.
She talks to fish, okay?

603
00:28:06,723 --> 00:28:08,189
I'm with Sweets on this one.

604
00:28:12,187 --> 00:28:13,873
- Hey, it's Zack.
- Hi, Zack.

605
00:28:15,335 --> 00:28:17,741
The pry bar from the garage
is not the murder weapon.

606
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,498
It's a pry bar like
this one but not this one.

607
00:28:20,618 --> 00:28:23,737
The deep parallel grooves on
the anterior border are not a match.

608
00:28:23,937 --> 00:28:25,131
What about the blood?

609
00:28:25,251 --> 00:28:27,917
Apparently,
the toluene caused a false positive.

610
00:28:28,203 --> 00:28:30,670
What about the vertical fracture
on his frontal suture?

611
00:28:31,162 --> 00:28:33,673
- That's the forehead.
- I did another scraping of the fracture

612
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:37,002
and I found a sliver of
glass with a mastic film on it.

613
00:28:37,122 --> 00:28:40,262
The mass spec shows it
as nitrate of silver,

614
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:42,891
so I think we're looking for
some kind of mirror.

615
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:44,862
Good. Thank you.

616
00:28:46,383 --> 00:28:48,138
Found it early this morning.

617
00:28:48,258 --> 00:28:50,210
No way of knowing
how long it's been here.

618
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:53,916
My guess is, it was stolen, driven
around some, then stripped for parts.

619
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:56,897
- VIN number matches?
- It's the victim's truck, all right.

620
00:28:57,017 --> 00:28:58,447
Hey, I've got to tell you.

621
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,311
I love working this one.

622
00:29:00,618 --> 00:29:02,948
I'm usually looking over some battered,
old heap for evidence,

623
00:29:03,068 --> 00:29:05,372
for evidence, but the vehicles
on this case...

624
00:29:05,532 --> 00:29:08,166
- they are sweet!
- You got anything else for me?

625
00:29:08,326 --> 00:29:11,086
They're testing mud on the bottom of
the vehicle on the chance it might match

626
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:13,212
- where the victim was dumped.
- Pry bar.

627
00:29:13,775 --> 00:29:14,834
Pry bar.

628
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:15,882
Yep.

629
00:29:16,534 --> 00:29:17,925
Covered in blood.

630
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:19,511
I blame the Stooges.

631
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:20,835
Excuse me?

632
00:29:20,955 --> 00:29:21,989
The Three Stooges.

633
00:29:22,109 --> 00:29:24,683
They were bashing each other on
the heads with hammers and bricks

634
00:29:24,843 --> 00:29:27,238
and stuff and never got hurt.
People think they can do it, too.

635
00:29:27,358 --> 00:29:28,510
Yeah, thanks for that.

636
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:31,109
All I'm saying is that killings
like this, are Stooge related.

637
00:29:33,101 --> 00:29:34,367
The side mirror.

638
00:29:37,093 --> 00:29:38,321
Long, jagged edge.

639
00:29:38,666 --> 00:29:41,449
He was standing by his truck, someone
came up behind him

640
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:44,043
- and hit him with the pry bar.
- Falls forward into the mirror...

641
00:29:44,163 --> 00:29:45,822
Fracturing his frontonasal suture.

642
00:29:46,364 --> 00:29:47,314
Forehead.

643
00:29:47,626 --> 00:29:50,077
Booth, this suggests only one assailant.

644
00:29:50,197 --> 00:29:52,104
Can we get luminol,
check the mirror for blood?

645
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:55,298
We're not hurting for blood around here.
Check this out.

646
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,841
Love these... Whoa!

647
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:01,343
Don't need any luminol for this.

648
00:30:01,525 --> 00:30:04,054
He was killed, loaded in the box,
driven to the mud and dumped.

649
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,762
It's physically impossible
for a paraplegic to do.

650
00:30:06,882 --> 00:30:08,717
If it's only one murderer,
it wasn't Garth.

651
00:30:08,837 --> 00:30:11,145
- Do we have any prints?
- Just the victim's, but we did find

652
00:30:11,265 --> 00:30:13,299
some hair in the box
where the body was placed.

653
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:14,714
It's dyed.

654
00:30:14,834 --> 00:30:16,880
We're checking for the exact
brand and color.

655
00:30:17,904 --> 00:30:19,445
The roots are gray.

656
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,690
It's short.

657
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:23,485
Lenny Fitz dyes his hair.

658
00:30:25,263 --> 00:30:27,536
Why would Lenny kill
his most valuable rider?

659
00:30:34,191 --> 00:30:37,785
I'd like the record to reflect
that my client has been drinking.

660
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:39,723
That's an understatement.

661
00:30:39,866 --> 00:30:43,369
And that he's rejecting my advice
not to speak to you at this time.

662
00:30:43,489 --> 00:30:45,425
Drinking a lot there, Lenny,
maybe out of guilt?

663
00:30:45,545 --> 00:30:47,075
I lost a son, Agent Booth.

664
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:48,940
A son.

665
00:30:49,422 --> 00:30:51,643
So excuse me for feeling bad
about that, all right?

666
00:30:51,832 --> 00:30:54,404
Do you mean your biological son,
or Tripp Goddard?

667
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,275
Lady, I loved Tripp Goddard like a son,

668
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,693
but, Danny...

669
00:31:00,135 --> 00:31:01,589
Danny, was my son.

670
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,084
- There's a difference.
- I'm confused.

671
00:31:04,204 --> 00:31:07,418
Is my client a person of interest
in this or an actual suspect,

672
00:31:07,538 --> 00:31:08,702
and in which death?

673
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:11,163
That depends upon whether
or not the same person killed

674
00:31:11,343 --> 00:31:13,848
both Danny Fitz and Tripp Goddard.

675
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:16,085
You can't think
that I killed one of them.

676
00:31:16,382 --> 00:31:17,544
We found Tripp's truck.

677
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:18,511
Where?

678
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:21,698
- A clearing in Jackson State Park.
- Forensic evidence shows that

679
00:31:21,818 --> 00:31:24,110
Tripp was murdered in
the mechanic's bay,

680
00:31:24,296 --> 00:31:26,512
and his body was transported
in his own truck.

681
00:31:26,673 --> 00:31:28,481
What's that got to do with my client?

682
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:31,569
There's forensic evidence
tying him to the body.

683
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,831
Whatcha got, a nail clipping?

684
00:31:34,031 --> 00:31:35,687
A piece of dried snot? A hair?

685
00:31:35,886 --> 00:31:38,565
No, we got forensic evidence.

686
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:42,100
Lenny, when was the last time
you saw Tripp?

687
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:43,819
I told you. At the victory party.

688
00:31:43,939 --> 00:31:46,067
You shook hands with him?
Sat next to him at the bar?

689
00:31:46,192 --> 00:31:48,657
- Did you make out a little?
- I hugged him.

690
00:31:48,777 --> 00:31:51,793
Any other questions about how trace
evidence from my client

691
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:53,825
may have wound up on Tripp's remains?

692
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:57,085
- Hold him on suspicion, that's all.
- Look, I didn't kill Tripp.

693
00:31:57,358 --> 00:32:00,045
I can get a court order to release
him in less than an hour.

694
00:32:00,189 --> 00:32:03,590
Look, why would I kill somebody
I just signed a business deal with?

695
00:32:04,371 --> 00:32:05,575
Wait. You what?

696
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,971
Mr. Fitz signed ten percent
of his company over to Tripp.

697
00:32:09,445 --> 00:32:10,850
You mean the motorcycle team?

698
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,021
No, Mr. Fitz means the beverage company.

699
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,727
Slam Bolt Energy Drinks?

700
00:32:15,431 --> 00:32:16,728
Why offer so much?

701
00:32:18,108 --> 00:32:19,523
'Cause he was the best.

702
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,475
So I offered him a piece
of the business as an incentive

703
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:24,570
to race exclusively for Slam Bolt.

704
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,067
And everybody's happy.

705
00:32:26,187 --> 00:32:27,252
Who isn't happy?

706
00:32:27,372 --> 00:32:28,783
Every other motorcycle team.

707
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:32,411
- Did Tripp Goddard sign?
- I got him the contract that night.

708
00:32:32,688 --> 00:32:33,958
And then hugged him.

709
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:36,619
- So, you signed it, but he didn't?
- We don't know.

710
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,626
You haven't found
the contract, have you?

711
00:32:41,165 --> 00:32:42,515
We'll be in touch.

712
00:32:47,346 --> 00:32:49,396
Sexual jealousy as a motive
didn't pan out,

713
00:32:49,631 --> 00:32:51,587
professional jealousy
was looking pretty good...

714
00:32:51,707 --> 00:32:54,100
- Until Danny was killed.
- But money... that's always good.

715
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:55,517
How much money?

716
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,676
Company like Slam Bolt?

717
00:32:57,939 --> 00:32:59,329
Millions is my guess.

718
00:32:59,453 --> 00:33:02,399
Tripp Goddard could have been
attacked by more than one person.

719
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:04,419
The skull shows that as a possibility.

720
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:06,092
No changies, Bones, okay?

721
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:08,980
Pry bar to the back of the skull,
mirror to the face.

722
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,438
No take backs. One killer.

723
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:13,236
I'm just saying that maybe
Philippa and Danny didn't like it

724
00:33:13,356 --> 00:33:16,571
when their father signed over a chunk of
their family company to Tripp Goddard.

725
00:33:16,691 --> 00:33:18,632
Well, it's a good business decision.

726
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,502
Look, Garth wants Tripp dead
for putting him in a wheelchair,

727
00:33:22,678 --> 00:33:25,839
Philippa wants Tripp dead for grabbing
up a hunk of her father's company.

728
00:33:26,015 --> 00:33:27,195
Two killers again?

729
00:33:27,315 --> 00:33:29,480
You said no changies and no take backs.

730
00:33:29,998 --> 00:33:30,998
Doesn't scan.

731
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:33,973
You know, I mean, why would either
Garth or Philippa want Danny dead?

732
00:33:34,302 --> 00:33:35,437
You're the motive guy.

733
00:33:35,561 --> 00:33:38,186
Look, we found Garth's Knee
Scrapers pen in the mud.

734
00:33:38,464 --> 00:33:41,053
That doesn't prove anything.
He gave them out to everybody.

735
00:33:43,811 --> 00:33:45,104
It's right here, Bones.

736
00:33:45,437 --> 00:33:48,121
It's right in front of us,
but I just... I can't get it.

737
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:50,874
The whole business
with changies and take backs...

738
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:52,741
it's not real, right?

739
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,021
No.

740
00:33:56,085 --> 00:33:57,462
I have another question.

741
00:33:57,844 --> 00:34:00,923
Is there anything more we can
learn from the murder weapon?

742
00:34:01,328 --> 00:34:02,854
No, that's a you question.

743
00:34:02,987 --> 00:34:06,192
My question is, how did the murderer

744
00:34:06,449 --> 00:34:08,049
know about the secret mud hole?

745
00:34:10,713 --> 00:34:13,930
Look, I know I was breaking the rules
when I drove my truck

746
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,689
on national park land,
but, I mean, this girl...

747
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:19,645
- Didn't you see her?
- I really don't care about that.

748
00:34:19,765 --> 00:34:20,977
Come on, have a heart.

749
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:23,936
I got it about the girl
the minute I saw her, okay?

750
00:34:24,088 --> 00:34:27,224
We all do things for the girl.

751
00:34:28,296 --> 00:34:30,026
So, what do you need to talk to me for?

752
00:34:30,146 --> 00:34:32,245
I need to know how you found
out about that mud hole.

753
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:33,129
Oh.

754
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:34,866
Oh, what?

755
00:34:36,323 --> 00:34:37,561
I don't want to be a rat.

756
00:34:37,681 --> 00:34:40,855
Look, sport, I don't care
about the girl, or the mud, or the 4x4.

757
00:34:42,133 --> 00:34:45,776
Hardly anyone knows about that place,
and someone dumped the body there.

758
00:34:47,233 --> 00:34:48,582
My friend told me about it.

759
00:34:48,702 --> 00:34:51,002
- I need a name.
- He didn't do it, he's in a wheelchair.

760
00:34:51,746 --> 00:34:53,380
Your friend's name Garth Jodrey?

761
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,260
- How did you know that?
- Special Agent Seeley Booth.

762
00:34:57,156 --> 00:34:57,958
Special.

763
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:03,517
This is the shaft of the pry bar.

764
00:35:03,641 --> 00:35:06,357
It's made of tempered steel
with a shiny chrome covering.

765
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,518
The murder weapon we found
on Tripp's truck.

766
00:35:08,662 --> 00:35:11,236
Yes. As you can see,
the chrome is compromised.

767
00:35:11,562 --> 00:35:14,522
Putting chrome on a pry bar is not
a good example of functionality.

768
00:35:14,735 --> 00:35:15,967
Maybe it was decorative.

769
00:35:16,092 --> 00:35:17,284
Those are blood flecks.

770
00:35:17,463 --> 00:35:18,505
From the victim?

771
00:35:18,628 --> 00:35:20,704
There's no way of knowing
until a DNA test is done.

772
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,854
The blood flecks begin approximately

773
00:35:22,974 --> 00:35:25,168
25% of the way up the handle.

774
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:27,818
- What does that indicate?
- I have absolutely no idea.

775
00:35:28,304 --> 00:35:29,159
Come on.

776
00:35:29,886 --> 00:35:30,688
Choke?

777
00:35:31,949 --> 00:35:34,377
Didn't anybody play
softball or baseball?

778
00:35:34,752 --> 00:35:35,552
Okay.

779
00:35:39,577 --> 00:35:40,599
It's a choke up.

780
00:35:41,054 --> 00:35:44,410
For somebody not strong enough
to swing the entire length of the bat.

781
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,202
Of course, it's a choke up.

782
00:35:47,308 --> 00:35:49,011
To foreshorten the fulcrum.

783
00:35:50,217 --> 00:35:51,411
Yes, I see.

784
00:35:51,531 --> 00:35:55,097
Because the murderer was weaker
than the full grown male human

785
00:35:55,217 --> 00:35:56,823
for whom the pry bar was designed.

786
00:35:56,999 --> 00:35:58,449
Right. Like a girl.

787
00:35:58,646 --> 00:35:59,912
Now, when I batted,

788
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,203
I always had to choke up.

789
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,975
Then, of course, I kicked ass.

790
00:36:05,186 --> 00:36:05,939
Sweet.

791
00:36:06,028 --> 00:36:07,876
I'll have Cam check the DNA.

792
00:36:13,101 --> 00:36:14,526
Excuse me? Temperance?

793
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:16,301
April, hi.

794
00:36:16,971 --> 00:36:20,289
I... wanted to talk to you,
woman to woman, if that's possible.

795
00:36:20,907 --> 00:36:23,400
It is possible because
we are both women.

796
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:32,824
Seeing you the other night,
it made merealize that

797
00:36:32,944 --> 00:36:34,304
you have a very objective eye.

798
00:36:35,174 --> 00:36:35,962
Thank you.

799
00:36:36,082 --> 00:36:37,822
And you got to see
Lance and me together.

800
00:36:37,961 --> 00:36:38,984
And I wonder if...

801
00:36:39,812 --> 00:36:41,361
if you might tell me what you think.

802
00:36:42,726 --> 00:36:45,176
Well, could you be more
specific in the question?

803
00:36:48,555 --> 00:36:49,365
Fish.

804
00:36:50,155 --> 00:36:53,215
Fish choose their mates
based primarily on color gradations.

805
00:36:53,557 --> 00:36:55,909
Two goamis, for example,
one male and one female

806
00:36:56,032 --> 00:36:58,011
they'll mate if they're
both vibrant blue.

807
00:36:58,734 --> 00:37:01,038
Now, if the male becomes paler,

808
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,431
which can happen
over the course of time,

809
00:37:03,653 --> 00:37:07,018
the female becomes
non-receptive to the male,

810
00:37:07,866 --> 00:37:08,884
even aggressive.

811
00:37:09,004 --> 00:37:10,581
Do you see where I'm going with this?

812
00:37:10,741 --> 00:37:12,190
Sweets is too pale?

813
00:37:12,573 --> 00:37:13,383
Yes.

814
00:37:14,768 --> 00:37:18,162
But let's say young instead
of pale and go with that.

815
00:37:18,824 --> 00:37:20,297
Is there an age difference?

816
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:24,105
I'm almost 27, and Lance just turned 23.

817
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:28,792
What's the age difference
between you and Booth?

818
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:33,793
Five years,
but, no, we are not blue fish.

819
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:39,878
But still, he's very firm once
you get him out of that suit, but...

820
00:37:40,155 --> 00:37:42,405
- A pale blue?
- Robin's egg, really.

821
00:37:43,415 --> 00:37:45,834
I'm a vibrant, vibrant cobalt.

822
00:37:47,854 --> 00:37:48,891
Not literally.

823
00:37:49,011 --> 00:37:50,812
I mean, we're both
mostly pink in reality.

824
00:37:50,932 --> 00:37:52,006
No. I understand.

825
00:37:52,902 --> 00:37:55,052
Did we seem good together to you?

826
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:58,097
April, it was only one evening.

827
00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:02,362
We got the DNA results
from the murder weapon.

828
00:38:02,486 --> 00:38:03,244
Sex?

829
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,951
It was much more than adequate.
It was wonderful, really.

830
00:38:06,143 --> 00:38:09,878
I mean, he's a night time person, and
I'm most enthusiastic in the morning,

831
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:11,499
but that's not the problem.

832
00:38:14,374 --> 00:38:15,166
Sorry.

833
00:38:15,896 --> 00:38:17,780
You were... you were talking about work.

834
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,632
DNA says the murderer was female.

835
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,904
Excuse me?

836
00:38:26,028 --> 00:38:27,558
We're here about a mud bath?

837
00:38:27,682 --> 00:38:30,725
Now, we got a sworn statement here
from Garth Jodrey that Philippa Fitz

838
00:38:30,845 --> 00:38:32,594
took him to the mud
hole three years ago.

839
00:38:32,714 --> 00:38:33,751
To have sex.

840
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:35,710
The same mud hole
that Tripp was dumped in.

841
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,476
I can give you a sworn statement
that Garth took me to that mud hole.

842
00:38:38,598 --> 00:38:40,252
I slid that one right by her.

843
00:38:40,372 --> 00:38:41,154
What?

844
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,785
You just admitted that you had prior
knowledge

845
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,452
to the location of a mud hole.

846
00:38:45,572 --> 00:38:47,159
- No changies.
- No take backs.

847
00:38:47,532 --> 00:38:49,932
Answer nothing without
prior confirmation from me.

848
00:38:50,123 --> 00:38:53,583
You killed Tripp because your father was
about to sign the company over to him.

849
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:56,225
- What?
- Don't respond in any way.

850
00:38:56,594 --> 00:38:58,213
We have DNA evidence

851
00:38:58,374 --> 00:39:00,782
that shows you swung the pry bar
into Tripp's head.

852
00:39:01,328 --> 00:39:04,608
According to the forensic report,
the sample was very small,

853
00:39:04,798 --> 00:39:06,915
and was totally used up
during the course of the test.

854
00:39:07,134 --> 00:39:10,059
- It's an accurate test.
- But it can't be repeated.

855
00:39:10,419 --> 00:39:12,444
And my client has a twin brother.

856
00:39:12,912 --> 00:39:15,407
Juries hate DNA evidence and twins.

857
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:17,482
What's that sound?

858
00:39:17,799 --> 00:39:20,862
I believe that's reasonable
doubt starting its engines.

859
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:24,531
We have evidence that the same pry bar
was used to sabotage

860
00:39:24,692 --> 00:39:25,879
Tripp's motorcycle.

861
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:29,401
A common tool left in a semi-public area

862
00:39:29,686 --> 00:39:31,479
in a situation that could have resulted

863
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,937
from incompetence rather than sabotage.

864
00:39:34,057 --> 00:39:37,351
You sabotaged the bike to kill Tripp,
but he signed the contract

865
00:39:37,471 --> 00:39:40,380
before he could ride the bike
and die the way he was supposed to.

866
00:39:40,577 --> 00:39:43,828
So, you killed him with the pry bar,
loaded him onto his own truck

867
00:39:43,952 --> 00:39:45,965
and dumped him in the mud puddle.

868
00:39:46,085 --> 00:39:48,685
Everything was great until your brother

869
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:50,557
rode the bike that you sabotaged.

870
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,311
You don't ride someone else's bike.

871
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,439
Danny knew that.

872
00:39:54,168 --> 00:39:57,048
You killed him accidentally,
but you did kill him.

873
00:39:57,452 --> 00:39:58,870
I loved my brother. I...

874
00:39:59,102 --> 00:40:00,423
Don't speak, please.

875
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:04,071
Are we free to go, or would you
like to waste some more

876
00:40:04,231 --> 00:40:05,496
of the taxpayers' money?

877
00:40:05,616 --> 00:40:07,363
- She did it.
- You may get a prosecutor

878
00:40:07,483 --> 00:40:10,493
to lay a murder charge,
but a jury will never bring home

879
00:40:10,671 --> 00:40:12,497
this baby the way you want it to.

880
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,880
You're right.

881
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:15,564
But you know what?

882
00:40:15,684 --> 00:40:18,293
- I'm still going to make the arrest.
- To what end?

883
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,716
You can't win.

884
00:40:19,836 --> 00:40:23,075
To let everybody knows what
Philippa did, including her father.

885
00:40:29,691 --> 00:40:31,764
I'm okay with what you did there.

886
00:40:32,048 --> 00:40:33,748
Yeah, thanks a million, Bones.

887
00:40:34,749 --> 00:40:35,791
Don't get mad.

888
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:37,542
I'm just saying that

889
00:40:38,321 --> 00:40:40,367
I just like it better when
we catch them and

890
00:40:41,075 --> 00:40:42,203
they go to jail.

891
00:40:42,728 --> 00:40:46,636
Sometimes it can get messy,
Bones, but the point is, it gets done.

892
00:40:46,756 --> 00:40:50,325
This one started out in a pit of mud
and ended in a pit of mud.

893
00:40:51,321 --> 00:40:53,079
That's very damn poetic of you.

894
00:40:54,878 --> 00:40:55,939
Oh, hey, guys.

895
00:40:56,798 --> 00:40:58,280
I didn't know you'd be here.

896
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:00,936
What do you think, Bones?

897
00:41:01,558 --> 00:41:02,558
He's lying.

898
00:41:02,832 --> 00:41:04,382
You want to sit down?

899
00:41:04,723 --> 00:41:05,723
Not really.

900
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:07,513
Lying again.

901
00:41:08,888 --> 00:41:10,215
Come on, sit down.

902
00:41:10,624 --> 00:41:11,636
Okay.

903
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,941
April dump you?

904
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:21,732
How do you know that?

905
00:41:21,856 --> 00:41:23,867
He's got that dumpee look on his face.

906
00:41:24,634 --> 00:41:26,318
I'm a trained psychologist.

907
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:28,405
I mean, I saw this coming.

908
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:30,729
It's not like the signs eluded me.

909
00:41:31,546 --> 00:41:33,909
So, I prepared myself mentally for it...

910
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:35,913
Hey, Sweets, Bones and I

911
00:41:36,073 --> 00:41:37,497
we're going bowling tonight.

912
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:38,748
Yes. Yes.

913
00:41:38,938 --> 00:41:39,792
Bowling.

914
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,967
You know what? You want to come?

915
00:41:43,087 --> 00:41:44,836
To go bowling with us
at the bowling rink?

916
00:41:44,956 --> 00:41:47,833
- Alley.
- Bowling alley. The bowling alley.

917
00:41:48,683 --> 00:41:50,968
You know, fish aren't actually sentient.

918
00:41:51,453 --> 00:41:54,218
There's a reason people
say "cold as a fish."

919
00:41:56,053 --> 00:41:57,706
Me? I'm a dog person.

920
00:41:59,093 --> 00:42:01,320
I think that has meaning, don't you?

921
00:42:02,535 --> 00:42:03,343
Sure.

922
00:42:04,693 --> 00:42:06,233
You think April was pretty?

923
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,464
Not at all.

924
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:15,581
You're lying, Dr. Brennan.

925
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:18,342
I appreciate the effort. Thank you.

926
00:42:18,517 --> 00:42:19,521
Come on, Sweets.

927
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:21,318
What do you say we go bowling?

928
00:42:21,442 --> 00:42:22,583
I got him. Come on.

929
00:42:22,703 --> 00:42:24,157
- No, it's all right.
- Come on.
