1
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,965
<i>[Man] This cemetery has been</i>
<i>connected to our parish...</i>

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:08,098
<i>for almost 200 years.</i>

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:13,275
3:00 a.m., the water main broke.
Felt like an earthquake.

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,678
Coffins were bursting
out of the ground.

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,084
- [Groans]
- Are you all right?

6
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:22,986
I've had some stomach problems lately.
This isn't helping.

7
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,616
<i>Last person was buried</i>
<i>here over 50 years ago.</i>

8
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,661
I don't know how you're
gonna figure out who's who.

9
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:31,390
With burial records, identification
should be pretty straightforward.

10
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,455
All right, let's see.

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,661
Female, 40 to 50 years old.

12
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:39,102
<i>Severe osteoporosis.</i>

13
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:42,107
Dress and jewelry place burial
around the late 19th century.

14
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:46,477
<i>This one's in pieces.</i>

15
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,674
What's going on here? Lorraine says
you're giving them church records.

16
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:53,651
The burial records, Father,
so they can <i>identify</i> and reinter the remains.

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,120
<i>Those records are my</i>
<i>responsibility, Father Sands.</i>

18
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,657
You're to go through me
before allowing their release.

19
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:02,923
- I'm sorry, Father. I saw no harm in it.
- I still run this parish.

20
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,362
- I understand.
- I'm Father William Donlan.

21
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,366
This is Dr. Brennan
from theJeffersonian.

22
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,994
- And this is...
- They can't speak for themselves?

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,302
I'm Dr. Addy. Are you one of those priests
who smacks school children with rulers?

24
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,309
That's not allowed anymore.

25
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,868
<i>We do need those</i>
<i>burial records, Father...</i>

26
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:22,346
and since this is a federally
protected historic site...

27
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,782
Fine. But I'll expect you two
to show some respect for where you are.

28
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:29,344
- <i>This is consecrated ground.</i>
- When did you say the last person
was buried here?

29
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,982
- 1951.
- This is a male...

30
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:34,652
buried no more than five years ago
without a casket.

31
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:38,128
- That's impossible.
- There's evidence of trauma to the frontal bone.

32
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:41,497
- Looks like a fatal assault.
- Arrange for a forensic team.

33
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:44,867
Hodgins will want to collect
soil for bugs and particulates. I'll call Booth.

34
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:50,205
I'm afraid your ground was
consecrated as a crime scene, Father.

35
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,306
You know, the priest
made a complaint.

36
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,645
He said that you made fun
of consecrated ground.

37
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:59,651
No, I didn't. Perhaps I was a bit colorful.

38
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,710
- Colorful?
- Yeah, writerly.

39
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,121
- I'm a best-selling author.
- The victim is 30 to 40 years old.

40
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:08,649
- He's an old-school priest.
- So I'm supposed to walk on egg shells...

41
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,424
because someone believes that a plot
of earth has supernatural properties...

42
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,932
- because they waved a wand over it?
- There's no wands.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,491
- The church doesn't use wands.
- Fine. Fine. Magic water.

44
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,560
Magic? Holy water.

45
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,835
- The terminology makes it real?
- You know what?
I can't work with you on this case.

46
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:25,776
What do you mean? The victim was
clearly murdered. We investigate murders...

47
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,837
- Together.
- There's evidence of blood
pooling on the frontal bone...

48
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,883
and an absence of concentric fractures.

49
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,613
- That requires investigation.
- I'm not working a whole case
with you attacking my beliefs.

50
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:37,349
- You should have just sailed off
with your boyfriend.
- Funny.

51
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:40,620
A man who believes in an invisible
super being wants to run my personal life.

52
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:44,060
Death would have followed quickly,
caused by cranial cerebral trauma.

53
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,030
By the way, 90% of the world
believes in God.

54
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,535
And at one time, most people were certain
that the sun revolved around the Earth.

55
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:52,298
You see what I mean?
I don't think this is about religion at all.

56
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:56,468
We obviously have issues, okay,
that are affecting our working relationship.

57
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,273
<i>You're afraid to deal with them,</i>
<i>so you just lash out at my religion.</i>

58
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,246
Can't you just be satisfied that if
I'm wrong about God, I'll burn in hell?

59
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,216
- That's tempting.
- Good. Now how about we get back to work?

60
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,549
I think we both still wanna find out
who killed this man.

61
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,090
<i>[Saroyan]</i>
<i>So a shovel hit the water main?</i>

62
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,593
The shovel was found a few feet
from where the water main burst...

63
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,595
buried in a colony of worms.

64
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:53,097
And they say Christmas
only comes once a year.

65
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:57,102
<i>Metal shavings match the shovel.</i>
<i>Someone was digging in the cemetery.</i>

66
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,865
Broke the water main,
resurrecting the dead.

67
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:02,305
And why was someone digging up
the cemetery at 3:00 in the morning?

68
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,538
- Maybe he came back to dig up the victim.
- Move him to another location.

69
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,809
- Yeah, or bury someone else.
- Dark.

70
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,179
Yeah, and this place
is always so sunny.

71
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,310
Here's our victim.

72
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:16,446
Found casings from eastern
tent caterpillars in his eye sockets.

73
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:20,618
Means he was buried
about three years ago. He has kind eyes.

74
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,684
How do you know he had kind eyes?

75
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,287
I had to make a choice, so I chose kind.

76
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:28,698
And you wonder why I love you.
Is she not fantastic?

77
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,404
You aren't seriously asking me
to be a part of this?

78
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,441
<i>Get your rendering over to Booth</i>
<i>so they can show the priests.</i>

79
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:39,808
I am going to go re-saturate
the dried blood, see if it's of any value.

80
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,742
Murder? I don't believe it was murder.

81
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:48,218
[Brennan]
It's not a matter of faith, Father.

82
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,222
The injuries are definitive.

83
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,726
You ever hear of the sin of pride, young woman?
You could be wrong.

84
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,227
Dr. Brennan here,
she's the best in her field.

85
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,730
He would have been buried
about three years ago.

86
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,766
I've been here 41 years.

87
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:04,530
I would know if someone had killed
and buried a man in my cemetery.

88
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,573
You seem quite proud yourself.

89
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,608
I don't need to be insulted.

90
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:13,009
- Knock it off.
- What, the rules don't apply to him?

91
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,411
Have you offered your guests
any tea or snacks, Father?

92
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,506
Isn't that why you're here?

93
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:21,451
I see someone wants his roast
dry and overcooked tonight.

94
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,354
Hi. I'm Lorraine.
I'm the parish administrator.

95
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,449
<i>I have some refreshments inside.</i>

96
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:30,360
- And Father Matt is there
if you need to talk to him.
- Nicknames for priests.

97
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,764
Last Sunday, he had the whole
congregation holding hands.

98
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,734
No wonder there's
no respect anymore.

99
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,863
Would you mind just taking a look
at this sketch we have here, please?

100
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,703
<i>So do you, uh, recognize him?</i>

101
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,266
- No. No, I do not.
- You're sure?

102
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,279
I'm not senile.

103
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,611
I can name every child I baptized...

104
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,048
every person I gave the last rites to...

105
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,245
<i>every plant on these grounds...</i>
<i>over 200 of them.</i>

106
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,221
That's aconite. This is <i>Oreganum vulgare.</i>

107
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,224
And over there are yew trees.

108
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,760
It was the druids who first
thought of the yew tree as sacred.

109
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,490
<i>The Christians adopted</i>
<i>the belief, claiming it as their own.</i>

110
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,623
- Stop.
- What? I'm just making friendly conversation.

111
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,396
If there's nothing else,
I'd like to finish pruning.

112
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,132
You go have tea with the hippie priest.

113
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,434
Follow me.

114
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,599
<i>I've been here three years.</i>

115
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,576
The Archdiocese was thinking
of closing the parish.

116
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,578
Sent me here to try
and breathe some life into it.

117
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:24,104
I started a sports program for the boys.
Organized singles dances.

118
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,583
None of this has been easy
for Father Donlan to accept.

119
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:30,144
So you don't believe in all
the supernatural mythology he does?

120
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,589
<i>Well, if you're talking</i>
<i>about the Holy Trinity...</i>

121
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:35,491
<i>the transubstantiation of the host</i>
<i>and the Resurrection...</i>

122
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,927
- I certainly do.
- But you seem like such an intelligent man.

123
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,864
- You have to excuse her, Father.
- No need.

124
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:43,925
God has a soft spot
even for the atheists.

125
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,494
I'm telling you, this is fantastic.
What is it?

126
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:51,805
- She's trying to concentrate.
- It's an orange-berry pound cake. I'm sorry.

127
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,847
- I don't think I recognize him.
- <i>[Booth] How long have you been here?</i>

128
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,008
<i>I've been here 23 years next month.</i>

129
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,144
My mother died when I was 12.
The parish took me in.

130
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,711
<i>I've been the administrator</i>
<i>for seven years now.</i>

131
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,223
Father Donlan basically raised Lorraine.

132
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,727
- You're not gonna eat that, are you, Father?
- <i>No.</i>

133
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,025
It's okay. My stomach hasn't
been too fond of me lately.

134
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,327
Then let's get out of your way.

135
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,130
Perhaps a nap wouldn't be a bad idea.

136
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,899
<i>Is there anyone else that we</i>
<i>can show the sketch to?</i>

137
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,873
Why don't you bring it to mass
on Sunday? We can pass it around.

138
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,671
Some of the parishioners
have been there a long time.

139
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,838
- Are you sure?
- Agent Booth, I'm trying
to build a community here.

140
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,576
<i>If we can't work together</i>
<i>to help solve a crime like this...</i>

141
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,584
then I'm not doing my job.

142
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,251
<i>[Booth] It doesn't help the case</i>
<i>for you to insult the priests.</i>

143
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,723
We're supposed to be gaining
their trust so they'll help us.

144
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,692
Matt wasn't threatened. You were.

145
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,729
We're definitely not
working well together.

146
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,095
- Because you're bossy and judgmental.
- Problems between people...

147
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,657
It's never just one person's fault.

148
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,726
What about Hitler?
He did pretty well on his own.

149
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,705
[Groans]
Bones, just...

150
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,943
come with me to go
see Dr. Wyatt just once.

151
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,538
No. Therapy is a vague
and inexact process.

152
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,708
The man shouldn't even
be called a doctor.

153
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,718
Well, he helped me.

154
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,754
I mean, are you
so threatened that, uh...

155
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,279
you can't even do a favor
for someone that you call a friend?

156
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,758
I will speak my mind, Booth.

157
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,229
I will speak my mind.

158
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,458
Okay.

159
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,504
<i>[Angela]</i>
<i>It's 7:30, Hodgins.</i>

160
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:28,506
I thought maybe the same shovel
was used as the murder weapon.

161
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,907
The metal residue on the skull
is some sort of silver alloy.

162
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:36,074
You said you were gonna be finished
in a minute. That was an hour ago.

163
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,878
If I can narrow down
the smelting process of the silver...

164
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,977
I might be able to figure out what kind
of weapon we're looking for.

165
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:45,319
I love it when you talk
about smelting.

166
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,586
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

167
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,660
- Move in with me.
- [Chuckles] What?

168
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,397
We already live together.
Just... Just move in.

169
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,304
[Laughs]
No, we don't.

170
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,433
You've taken over my closet.

171
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,945
It's over half full, and "over half"...

172
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,504
is the common law definition
of living together.

173
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,575
l-I have my own place, Jack.

174
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,982
- I need my place.
- I need you.

<i>So, I have bad news.</i>

179
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,873
We've all been exposed
to coccidioidomycosis...

180
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,707
a fungal infection from
the graveyard dirt we've been breathing.

181
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,112
Symptoms include nausea,
weakness, fever...

182
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,116
- I feel fine.
- Yeah. Me too.

183
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,345
- Decreased libido.
- I'm listening.

184
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,388
[Laughs]
We're all gonna get shots.

185
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,514
- Yeah, that-that sounds good.
- Very good. Yeah.

186
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,650
Thought so.

187
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,089
She refers to God
as my invisible friend.

188
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,155
You're talking to somebody
who isn't there.

189
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,200
I'm sure the doctor
questions your little fantasy.

190
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,998
My beliefs aren't
at issue here, Dr. Brennan.

191
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,699
Clearly she's intolerant,
and it's affecting our working relationship.

192
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,741
Yes, he's very difficult to work with.

193
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:13,142
Booth said that you
could fix us, so...

194
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,779
"What now is proved
was once only imagin'd.

195
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:23,049
"The rat, the mouse, the fox,

200

What?

201
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,996
- Oh, come now. Surely you get the reference.
- William Blake.

202
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,200
Yes. Blake is telling us that we're all
at the mercy of our fundamental natures.

203
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:46,506
Which is nonsense, of course,
but when we understand our natures...

204
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,706
we understand the resulting conflicts.

205
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,874
- What?
- I hate psychology.

206
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,078
As do I. It applies a patina of science...

207
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,587
over what is essentially
a dark and complex set...

208
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,216
roiling "unknowables."

209
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,021
You see? What?

210
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,085
<i>You weren't fighting about religion.</i>

211
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,028
But that's what Booth said.

212
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:09,932
Religion provided
the flash point you needed...

213
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,664
<i>to expose an underlying issue.</i>

214
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,706

<i>Do you see where we are?</i>

229
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,482
You don't talk like that in church.

230
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,644
- Okay. Uh...
- Ah.

231
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,416
What does that lab do to you people?

- And now that Sully is gone...
- It's not.

235

We have Special Agent Booth and Miss

241
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,608
<i>and they need our help identifying</i>
<i>the victim found in our cemetery.</i>

242
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,450
<i>Now, I know none of us want</i>
<i>to get involved...</i>

243

<i>"Whatever you do...</i>

Yeah, I think I can manage that.

252
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,008
James was an altar boy here
when he was younger.

253
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,155
<i>[James]</i>
<i>Um...</i>

254
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,714
<i>I... I think...</i>

255
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,490
Does this look like
Father McCourt to anyone else?

256
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,498
- Yeah, that could be him.
- Someone killed a priest?

257
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,700
- Thank you, James.
- Yeah.

258
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,240
Father McCourt was here before me.

259
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:33,039
I replaced him three years ago.
I was told he left the priesthood.

260
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,943
I suppose it might resemble
Father McCourt.

261
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,988
So much for that sharp memory.

262
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,285
Father McCourt wasn't here for long.

263
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,258
And the eyes are wrong.
That's how you recognize someone.

264
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,296
Father McCourt's eyes
were hollow... cold.

265
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:55,026
- I take it you two didn't get along, huh?
- I was his confessor.

266
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,968
- You know I can't say anything.
- Can you tell me anything?

267
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:02,007
Just... he was very secretive.

268
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,235
He'd disappear for hours at a time.

269
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,244
Some nights, he wouldn't even
come back to the rectory.

270
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:10,112
One day he was gone. Left a note saying
he was leaving the priesthood.

271
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,742
Hmm. All right, thanks.

272
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:16,413
I've identified some odd
postmortem injuries on the old bodies...

273
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:19,184
Snapped fingers, fractured wrists...

274
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,419
abrasions on the ligamenta flava.

275
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:25,293
- And I found traces of gold
in some of the fractures.
- I don't get it.

276
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,822
The person who ruptured the water main
that night was a grave robber.

277
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,961
<i>Dr. Brennan told me</i>
<i>she saw injuries like this in Tibet...</i>

278
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,005
broken bones and bone markings...

279
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,735
from yanking jewelry
and valuables off the remains.

280
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,607
Yeah, which means McCourt
could have been struck by a shovel...

281
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:44,479
but also he could have been struck by
one of the valuables the grave robber found.

282
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,314
So our grave robber
comes to a nice, quiet graveyard...

283
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,822
<i>next to a nice, quiet church</i>
<i>whenever he's in need of some extra cash.</i>

284
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,051
Only to be surprised one night
by Father McCourt...

285
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,150
who gets his head bashed in for his trouble.

286
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:09,004
<i>During the 19th century, it was customary</i>
<i>to photograph the deceased before burial.</i>

287
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,008
We identified these two people.

288
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,204
Gertrude Waters died 1873.

289
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,649
- <i>And Horace Rutledge died 1901.</i>
- Their valuables were missing?

290
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:22,050
Yes. Dr. Hodgins believes
the grave robber is working in sections...

291
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,385
focusing on the oldest first...

292
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,788
where the artifacts
would have the most value.

293
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,793
<i>Listen, who takes care</i>
<i>of the cemetery?</i>

294
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,796
Uh, landscaper? Janitor?

295
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:35,197
Father Donlan does all the gardening.
It's sort of his obsession.

296
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,134
Other than that, the occasional
parishioner will rake leaves...

297
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:41,570
or, uh, shovel snow.

298
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,733
You all right?

299
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,744
You know, I can't quite shake this bug...

300
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:50,270
and I've got a wrestling team to coach.

301
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,317
Do you mind?

302
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:55,842
You were in close proximity with remains.

303
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:59,322
- You were probably exposed to a fungal infection.
- Well, i-is that bad?

304
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,756
- No.
- Yeah.

305
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,760
It's nothing to worry about.

306
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:06,889
- I'll have my office arrange for treatment.
- Thank you.

313
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,950
That sounds good.

314
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,952
There is tension...

315
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,286
ever since Brennan let Sully
sail off into the sunset without her.

316
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,349
- No, I didn't notice.
- Hmm.

317
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,758
Then again, I didn't notice that
you didn't want to live with me either.

318
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,024
- Hodgins.
- If you are getting cold feet...

- The Egyptian place?
- Mmm.

322
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,231
Just got off the phone with the C.D.C.

323
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,276
The fungal infection
we were exposed to from the graveyard...

324
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,743
is rare enough that they'd have records
of anyone who was infected.

325
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:57,805
- But I need your samples for the strain.
- You got it.

326
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,443
Yeah, you know,
I got no problem with this place.

327
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,819
It's where Bones and the squints
get their answers. See?

328
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:09,827
<i>Thumbs in the belt.</i>
<i>That's a very aggressive stance. Very male.</i>

329
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,492
<i>Crossed arms. Defensive.</i>

330
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:20,230
Disdain. But let's not worry
about what you do with your hands.

331
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:24,071
What you must do is recognize
your negative feelings...

332
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:27,635
for what is, after all,
Dr. Brennan's domain...

333
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,773
- and verbalize them.
- Verbalize them. What, now?

334
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:35,252
- Mm-hmm.
- This place is too, uh... It's too shiny.

335
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,187
You know? It's bright. It's clean.

336
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,488
- And clean is bad?
- Death isn't clean...

337
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,085
especially murder,
which is our business.

338
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,290
No, this place is completely fake.

339
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,334
- It's bogus.
- You'd like to destroy the entire edifice.

340
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,336
Oh, I'd like to rip
the whole edifice down...

341
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,372
with my bare hands,
or set it on fire...

342
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,465
Except, you know,
there's nothing in this place to burn.

343
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,170
All the plastic and the metal and
the flashing lights, and the arithmetic.

344
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,769
Where does a guy...
a normal guy...

345
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,543
who believes in intuition
and the soul and good and evil...

346
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,379
- And God.
- Yes! And God too.

347
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,386
Where's a guy who doesn't believe
in all this arithmetic supposed to stand?

348
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,287
So your problem with Dr. Brennan
is that you don't know...

349
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:15,690
what will or will not catch fire,
or where you stand.

350
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,663
- [Chuckles] What?
- That's good.

351
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:22,564
You know this... That's very good.

352
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,506
C.D.C. shows that you contracted
coccidioidomycosis three years ago.

353
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:35,308
The only case in the area.

354
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,975
Well, you know, I used to do a lot
of odd jobs around the parish.

355
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,212
<i>I'd help Father Donlan in the garden.</i>

356
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,754
- <i>I'm sure that's how I contracted it.</i>
- Nice try, Enzo...

357
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:48,486
but your name also came up on the auction
site that was selling jewelry from the graves.

358
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,529
Which you might have gotten away with,
if you hadn't hit the water main.

359
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,758
I want a lawyer.

360
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:57,734
- Nice way to get him to clam up. Thanks.
- [Brennan] What?

361
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,862
So why'd you kill Father McCourt?

362
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,769
- <i>Did he catch you?</i>
- I didn't kill anybody.

363
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,865
Ah. There you go.
He's talking again.

364
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,069
What is wrong with you people?
You think I'd kill a priest?

365
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,205
Your record also shows
that you were assigned...

366
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,215
to court-appointed drug counseling.

367
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,252
Okay, look, I had a drug problem,
and I needed money.

368
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,253
<i>I saw these pictures in the rectory.</i>

369
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,983
Jewelry just buried, you know.

370
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,685
I figured no one would miss it.

371
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,957
I didn't kill anybody. Okay?

372
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:29,432
Father McCourt and me,
we never had that problem.

373
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,026
<i>I wasn't his type. Too old.</i>

374
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,971
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

375
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,600
I'm pretty sure
it's an implication of pedophilia.

376
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,735
- <i>I know, Bones. It's strange I know...</i>
- You said you...

377
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,302
Who, Enzo? Who was his type?

378
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,883
Talk toJames, okay?
The kid who I.D.'d him.

Perfect replica for the new exhibit.

We're just making it
a little bit more authentic.

384
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,179
Your feet aren't cold anymore.

385
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,188
Nice try.

386
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,248
Hey, I thought I was successful,
but if you want me to try harder...

387
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,797
We can't keep our hands
off each other.

388
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,530
- I think about you all the time.
- Mm-hmm.

389
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,199
Moving in is the next logical step.

390
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:46,136
I have a lease.

391
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:49,408
I have an estate.
I'll buy out your lease.

392
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,009
Shh! We only have 15 more minutes.

393
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,110
- You said that we would talk.
- Yeah, well, guess what.

394
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,815
- Hmm?
- I got distracted.

<i># [Continues]</i>

396
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,932
I can't believe Father McCourt's dead.

397
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,803
I mean, I thought he just took off.

398
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,842
You two were pretty close.

399
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:22,312
- Yeah. I was an altar boy.
- Oh, so was I.

400
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:27,842
- I liked our priest, too, but, uh...
- What?

401
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,150
You think what everyone
else does, don't you?

402
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,885
I don't know.
What does everybody else think?

403
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,524
Because we spent
so much time together, he was...

404
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,357
touching me and stuff.

405
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:46,461
Really? Because, you know, if he did...

406
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,563
and you got mad one day and...

407
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,574
And killed him?

408
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,871
You think I killed Father McCourt?

409
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:57,711
He never touched me. Not even once.

410
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,717
He was my best friend.

411
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,049
My dad bailed on us
when I was three.

412
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,111
Father McCourt came to my ball games.

413
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:06,180
He yelled at me about my grades.

414
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,192
He was the only one who cared.
It doesn't matter what you think.

415
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,559
- Father Donlan didn't even believe me.
- Father Donlan?

416
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,598
Yeah.

417
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,600
About a month before
Father McCourt disappeared...

418
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,602
Father Donlan came to my house.

419
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,900
He said he knew what
Father McCourt was doing to me.

420
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,906
He wouldn't listen.

421
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:26,808
He was screaming that Father McCourt
was going to pay for his sins.

422
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,937
<i>I'm telling you, it was scary.</i>

423
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,278
That old priest was crazy.

424
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,409
He was just crazy.

425
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,958
Yes, I was strict
with Father McCourt.

426
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,995
I'm strict with all the priests
who are assigned to my parish.

427
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,791
How strict, Father?

428
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,596
I'm not a new age priest,
like Father Matt.

429
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,603
The church should be firm and act...

430
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,402
as an immovable bulwark
in the face of change.

431
00:22:56,475 --> 00:23:00,809
<i>Actually, organized belief systems</i>
<i>which fail to adapt to changing mores...</i>

432
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,813
<i>are demoted from religions...</i>

433
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,076
to acknowledged metaphoric myth systems.

434
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,916
I mean, no one worships Odin anymore, or Zeus.
[Laughs]

435
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,356
Thanks, Bones. I can take it from here.

436
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,191
- You're kicking me out?
- Yes.

437
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:21,426
All he can think about now is giving you
catechism. I need him to answer questions.

438
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,968
Wyatt's psychology isn't working.

439
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:33,872
Father, I contacted the Archdiocese
about St. Agatha's...

440
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:37,676
and they said quite a few priests
have come and gone...

441
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,683
<i>during your tenure.</i>

442
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,481
Given who they've sent me,
I've done well.

443
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:46,490
- Who did they send you?
- Priests who need firm guidance, for the most part.

444
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,791
In 1997, a complaint
was sworn against you for assault.

445
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,457
Is that your idea of firm guidance?

446
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,865
It was not assault.
It was corporal punishment.

447
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,802
<i>Found an altar boy drinking</i>
<i>sacramental wine from the chalice.</i>

448
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,066
- And you caned him?
- <i>The charges were dropped.</i>

449
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,576
I learned my lesson, and I have
never struck anyone since.

450
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,912
Father Donlan, in your opinion...

451
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,813
did Father McCourt pay
too much attention toJames Levay?

452
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,479
- You should askJames.
- I did.

453
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,216
James told us that you
suspected the worst.

454
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,225
He was frightened
at how angry you were.

455
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:25,125
I regret scaring him.

456
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,165
He was only a child.

457
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,765
There are greenstick fractures
on the victim's left ulna...

458
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,036
as well as his fibula and some ribs.

459
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,600
Probably defensive wounds
received in the struggle.

460
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,115
There's no evidence of a struggle.
These seem to have occurred postmortem...

461
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:46,742
when he was dragged,
probably for burial.

462
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,150
<i>But even getting dragged over rocks</i>
<i>shouldn't have caused those fractures.</i>

463
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,189
The matrix of the bone was weakened.

464
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,224
The cause could be genetic.

465
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:56,692
Or it could be some chemical or medicine
that compromised the tissue.

466
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,729
<i>I'll need samples</i>
<i>to run some tox screens.</i>

467
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,731
<i>All right, see these</i>
<i>tiny metallic fragments...</i>

468
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,926
embedded in the victim's skull?
It's silver.

469
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,868
<i>[Saroyan]</i>
<i>Then I'll assume he wasn't struck by a shovel.</i>

470
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,905
The silver was smelted
using a lead reduction method.

471
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,464
The fluxes used indicate
it was from the early 1800s...

472
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,476
<i>probably during the Napoleonic Wars.</i>

473
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:16,207
One of our old skeletons
was I.D.'d as a bishop. BishopJursik.

474
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:19,045
- <i>Died 1889.</i>
- Yeah, his robes were worth a fortune.

475
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:21,517
Let's find out if he was buried
with something silver...

476
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:24,612
a scepter or a shepherd's crook...

477
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:28,056
or something else suitable
for skull cracking.

478
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,090
Booth kicked me out of here.

479
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,095
For you to say "kicked out"...

480
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:36,156
means that you have acquiesced
in the idea that this is his domain.

481
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:39,169
Domain. Yes.

482
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:43,401
He's good at questioning people.
He can... He can tell when they're lying.

483
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:47,741
- Can you?
- I've learned a lot from him about people.

484
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,677
But?

485
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:53,115
It's not that Booth
has a sixth sense.

486
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:56,119
There is demonstrably
no sixth sense to have.

487
00:25:56,187 --> 00:26:00,283
<i>Obviously he reads</i>

00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,825
Yes. You don't sound very satisfied...

490
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,092
with your own argument
though, do you?

491
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,191
Booth likes to say...

492
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:13,101
"There are more things
on heaven and Earth, Bones...

493
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,264
than are dreamt of in your science."

494
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,468

Yes. Yes, l-I was... I was, uh...

497
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,677
I was aware of that.

498
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:31,381
So if you're so
uncomfortable here, why come?

499
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:35,153
Because... something goes on in here.

500
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:37,956
- He does something.
- And you want to find out what it is...

501
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,224
dissect it... so that you
can do it yourself?

502
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:42,823
- Yes.
- So that you can do it without Booth?

503
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,461
- So that you won't need him anymore.
- No.

504
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:48,165
- No?
- No, I just want to observe.

505
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:52,699
Surely, if you want to observe, you can do that
the other side of the mirror there...

506
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:57,043
instead of insisting on being in this room
with him, out of your element.

507
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,516
Observation isn't just seeing, Dr. Wyatt.

508
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,519
It's experiencing.

509
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:06,489
Ideally, I'd prefer
being inside Booth's head.

510
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,823
You know, seeing
and feeling things the way he does.

511
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:12,055
Then maybe I... I'd understand.

512
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,258
Be one with him?

513
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:19,565

You see, there was no

521
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,961

- Where is she going?
- Bones, Bones, Bones, Bones.

525

You are approaching the altar.

526
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:56,406
- Very sensitive area.
- Okay.

527
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,408
You must have
known Father McCourt pretty well.

528
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:01,036
Did him and Father Matt
have similar tastes?

529
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:04,809
Look, the only similarity I know of
was that they were from the same seminary.

530
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,477
- Same seminary?
- Look, Agent Booth...

531
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,146
there's so much suspicion
and innuendo these days.

532
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:12,155
This is a good parish.

533
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:14,157
- The father makes sure of that.
- What's that?

534
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,955
- It's the chalice.
- Oh, no, it's...

535
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,054
<i>It's the vessel in which the wine is</i>
<i>transformed into the blood of Christ.</i>

536
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,065
- Don't touch it.
- It is going to be touched, Booth.

537
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,260
It's silver and these little eagles...

538
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,326
are a common Napoleonic motif.

539
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,395
You're saying that it's, uh...

540
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:31,965
- possible that this could be a-a murder weapon?
- Yeah.

541
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:36,173
Can we take this with us,
or do we need to serve a warrant on God?

542

[Beeping]

543
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,853
It's a match.

544
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:46,152
The silver fragments in Father McCourt's
skull came from that chalice.

545
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,419
Well, that officially looks
the least like a murder weapon...

546
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,484
than any murder weapon I've seen.

547
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:54,020
<i>The green bone response indicated</i>
<i>the injury was inflicted perimortem.</i>

548
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,863
That means he might have
already been dead when he was struck.

549
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,301
- So we have no cause of death?
- Yes, we do.

550
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,134
McCourt was poisoned...
an alkaloid called taxin.

551
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:05,142
- Could it have been accidental?
- Not at these concentrations.

552
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:09,169
I'll go compile a list of possible
sources of the poison at the church.

553
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,181
So what if they went
to the same seminary?

554
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,013
Then why didn't Father Matt mention it?
What else is he not saying?

555
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,679
This is intuition, right?
You're subconsciously recalling pupil dilation...

556
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,723
- or some pheromones?
- You know what?

557
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,486
- We're not talking the same language here. Huh?

<i>Right. But I told you,</i>
<i>I never met Father McCourt.</i>

I didn't know him there.

00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,044
Did you know everyone
who went to your college?

579
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,385
You do know why
Father McCourt was sent here?

580
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,947
Yeah, I've heard the rumors. That's all.

581
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:31,962
Do you base all your investigations
on rumors, Agent Booth?

582
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,898
- He has a point, Booth.
- You know, St. Agatha
has been a dumping ground...

583
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:39,528
for troubled priests for some time,
so it's reasonable to suggest...

584
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,595
that you're one of them.

585
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,506
I told you why I was sent here.

586
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,204
I got work to do.

[Blows Whistle]

588
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,617
Okay, listen up.

589
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,155
So you still think
Father Donlan is the killer?

590
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,462
- I mean, Matt could have killed
McCourt and taken his post.
- Why?

591
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,934
Because McCourt was going
to come clean about being a pedophile...

592
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,471
maybe accuse Matt,
if they knew each other.

593
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:18,407
Of course, there's
no evidence of that.

594
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:20,569
I have no intuition.

595
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:23,739
- None. Zilch.
- You have no analytical skills.

596
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,249
I mean, you're all about
emotion and feeling.

- Psychologists.
- Oh.

600
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:36,319
- What? You're the one who believes in them.
- Let's stick to the case.

601
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,625
We know that Father Donlan
is this harsh, judgmental guy.

602
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:42,427
He keeps being sent these, uh,
problematic priests.

603
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,866
- There's McCourt. There's Father Matt...
- No proof.

604
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:47,370
Yeah, but, Bones,
it happens, all right?

605
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:50,930
Anyways, Father Donlan is getting old,
he can't deal, so he takes action.

606
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,477
- Old Testament action?
- There you go again. You're attacking God.

607
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:56,172
I'm not attacking God.
He doesn't exist, so how can...

Quarreling? Yes, of course you are.

- what has been rent asunder.
- Great. So you figured out our problem?

612
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,483
- Yes.
- From three meetings?

613
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,754
I knew what your problem was
right off the bat...

614

if you'll forgive
a cricketing metaphor.

615
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,990
The meetings were for fun.

<i>Booth never knows where</i>
<i>to stand when he's in the lab.</i>

Ditto Dr. Brennan
in the interrogation room.

619
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,868
Simple geography.
Sense of belonging.

620
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,969
- <i>Et cetera.</i>
- But that's not the main problem.

621
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:31,379
- He can't possibly know.
- <i>Yes, I do.</i>

622
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,577
You're both afraid
that the reason...

623
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:38,645
Dr. Brennan didn't sail off into
the sunset with her boyfriend Sully...

624
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:42,921
might have been because
of her ties to Agent Booth.

625
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:50,694
<i>You're both quite wrong.</i>

626
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,535
<i>Why didn't I go with Sully?</i>

627
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:59,303
- How is he supposed to know?
- Sully is perfect.

628
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:02,073
We communicated well.
The sex was incredible.

629
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:06,742
<i>He invited me to sail around the South Seas</i>
<i>in a beautiful yacht for a year.</i>

630
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,786
I mean, why would
anyone turn that down?

631
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:12,789
In my opinion, you are unable
to lead a purposeless life...

632
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:15,917
at this stage in your
psycho-social development.

633
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,019
Which, by the way, is an issue
you should address...

634
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,030
because a certain amount
of purposelessness...

635
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,794
- is necessary to lead a full life.
- I hate psychology.

636
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:24,858
You don't like it because he's saying...

637
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:27,404
that all this tension
between me and you is your fault.

638
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:31,272
Mmm, on the contrary. If anything,
your issues are more pronounced...

639
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:35,142
given that your behavior has been
affected by what turns out to be...

640
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,647
a quite irrational fear of being
responsible for somebody else's destiny.

641
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,206
- That makes sense.
- Oh, now you like psychology.

00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,663
- Feel?
- Yeah.

648
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:02,399
You must feel something.

649
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:07,676
I do. You know what I feel?

650
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,340

a long time.

00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,977
- He got treated for the fungus.
- But he hasn't shown any signs of recovery.

652
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,419
- So?
- I <i>feel</i> that's weird.

653
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,854
I mean, his symptoms
should have cleared up by now.

654
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:23,325
I <i>feel</i> that since
Father McCourt was poisoned...

655
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,625
We should have Father Matt
checked for the same poison.

656
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,858
- Ha, ha.
- What?

657
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,629
- We're back.
- We're back.

658
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,770
- Poisoned?
- <i>[Saroyan] Yes, Father...</i>

659
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,931
by something called taxin.

660
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,975
Father McCourt was poisoned?

661
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:40,203
Poison's easily derived
from boiling yew tree needles.

662
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,644
We have yew trees at St. Agatha's.

663
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:45,147
Symptoms include nausea, vomiting...

664
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,844
<i>increased salivation,</i>
<i>stomach ache, diarrhea...</i>

665
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,012
spasms and death.

666
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:53,023
Well, I have all of those...
except for death.

667
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,025
So far.

668
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,688
We suspect the poison weakened him,
made him unable to defend himself.

669
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,890
Defend himself from whom?

670
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:02,899
Someone much weaker than himself.

671
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,128
Say, an old man.

672
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,867
- Yellow.
- Yellow? What does that mean?

673
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,344
The good news is we know how
to make you feel better.

674
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,881
Bad news is someone's trying to kill you.

675
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,250
- So things are all right?
- According to the psychiatrist,
we were both concerned...

676
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:26,188
that Booth was the reason
that I didn't run off with Sully.

677
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,191
[Laughs]
It wasn't?

678
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:31,387
No, it's because I'm currently unable
to live a life without tangible focus...

679
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,659
so, you know, sailing around paradise
with the man I adore...

680
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:37,360
Well, you believe that?

681
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,869
If I expect people
to defer to me as an anthropologist...

682
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,201
I have to concede
to their fields of expertise.

683
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:46,039
- Right.
- And our working relationship
has definitely improved, so...

684
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,510
Hmm. Maybe I should
talk to this guy.

685
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,843
Uh, why?

686
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,906
Hodgins asked me
to move in with him...

687
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,077
but I'm-I'm not sure.

688
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,088
I mean, what's the problem?
Hodgins is perfect.

689
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,523
I'm... nuts about him.

690
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:04,356
I'll call the doctor.

691
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:10,198
I'm certain that I'm innocent of
whatever it is you think I did this time.

692
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:14,898
- Can you <i>identify</i> this clipping, sir?
- <i>Taxus baccata.</i>

693
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:17,406
European, or common, yew.

694
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,466
Then you're aware
that it's poisonous.

695
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:22,570
Did you bring me here
to test my botanical knowledge?

696
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:25,275
Both Father McCourt and Father Matt
suffered yew poisoning.

697
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,977
The hell you say.

698
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,111
Is he allowed to say that?

699
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,179
Dr. Brennan's people can prove...

700
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:35,714
that the poison from the yew tree
came from your own yard.

701
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:38,421
Both Fathers McCourt and Sands?

702
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,293
It's why Father Matt
has been so sick.

703
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:44,164
Can you think of anyone else
who'd want to poison these two priests?

704
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,499
<i>Aside from you.</i>

705
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,842
No. No one.

706
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:57,147
I'm going to need a lawyer.

707
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,308
<i>A damn Jesuit would be best.</i>

708
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,819
- Are you confessing, Father?
- Yes. I did it.

709
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:11,259
What?

710
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:16,166
When this goes to trial, Father...

711
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:20,261
you're going to have
to place your hand on the Holy Bible...

712
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:22,966
and swear to God to tell the truth.

713
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,406
You going to be able to do that?

714
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:28,445
- What's going on?
- Get me my lawyer.

715
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:31,003
- See, I don't think you will.
- Why?

716
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:35,143
You didn't do it.
See, it's time to render unto Caesar.

717
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:46,661
On one condition.

718
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,790
I take the confession.

719
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,529
I never set out to kill Father McCourt.

720
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,730
You poisoned him.

721
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:56,898
I saw the way he looked
atJames Levay.

722
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:59,841
l-I tried to give him
just enough poison...

723
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,368
to make him too sick to want to...

724
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,041
But he... He fell and hit his head.

725
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,051
He wasn't breathing.

726
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,246
<i>I had to make sure he was dead.</i>

727
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,585
<i>I couldn't bury him</i>
<i>without making sure.</i>

728
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,716
And the heaviest thing
she could find was the chalice.

729
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,987
<i>[Donlan]</i>
<i>And Father Matt?</i>

730
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:20,895
Wrestling... Boys were all over him.

731
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,525
And I knew better this time.

732
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,569
Less... poison.

733
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,196
Father McCourt was
a mistake, Father. I...

734
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:33,574
Lorraine, there was no proof
that Father McCourt touched anyone.

735
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,669
Only rumors. And Father Matt...

736
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,738
You were so angry at Father Matt.
I see the way you look at him.

737
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,250
Because he was sent here to replace me.

738
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:45,585
What you saw was my own pride,
my own weakness.

739
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,217
- Father Matt is a good man.
- I was...

740
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:51,261
I was trying to help.

741
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,422
I was just trying to help.

742
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,795
Do you absolve me, Father?

743
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,100
We're not alone with God, Lorraine.

744
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,874
This is not that kind of confession.

745
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:25,220

<i>Dr. Wyatt? We need you to do it with her.</i>

750
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:21,107
[Chuckles]
W-W-Would that I could, but, uh...

751
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,813
unfortunately, my heart
belongs to another.

752
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:27,824
No, it's actually my,
uh, boyfriend...

753
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:30,087
uh, asked me to move in with him...

754
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:33,221
and I need to know
if I should or not.

755
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:36,130
I told her to come talk to you.

756
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,795
Look, I absolutely refuse
to be relegated to the role...

757
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:44,170
of some sort of advice columnist
or daytime television shrink.

758
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:47,301
<i>Brennan says the you're</i>
<i>the only psychological type...</i>

759
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,369
who's ever made any sense to her.

760
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,847
Yes, well, now, of course,
you're flattering me...

761
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,941
so obviously I'm helpless.

762
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,952
All right, so, uh,
what made you think...

763
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,045
you should move in with him
in the first place?

764
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:02,354
- The closet test.
- Over half of his closet is filled with my things.

765
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:06,260
I see. What about your own closet?
It overflows with his things, does it?

766
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,231
Uh, no. It doth not.

767
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,234
Well then, I suggest
you wait until it does...

768
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,202
thus rendering you
manifest equals...

769
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:18,435
tabling until that day, the vexed question
of who should move in with whom.

770
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:21,535
- He is good.
- I told you.

771
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:24,740
As a stopgap, you should move
enough clothing from his closet...

772
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:28,512
so as to occupy
less than 30% of the space.

773
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:30,520
You know, the accent...

774
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,579
makes everything that you say
sound really smart.

775
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,624
Stopgap.

776
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,524
Oh, you're not leaving,
are you, Dr. Brennan?

777
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:43,363
Um, Booth and I have to put
our notes together for the prosecutor.

778
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:47,461
- So...
- Oh, so, you and Booth, uh...

779
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:49,904
You making any further
assumptions about each other?

780
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:52,772
No. No assumptions.

781
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:56,210
- Thanks.
- Good.

782
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,585
Well, look at that.

783
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:04,621
- You fixed them too.
- Mm-hmm.

784
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:09,593
All right, listen up, Monty Python.

785
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,958
You got it right with Hodgins and I.
That's fine.

786
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,556
But we both know that
you are full of it on the other thing.

787
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:18,727
[Chuckles]
I have no idea to what you refer.

788
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:21,100
Brennan didn't run off with Sully...

789
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:24,163
because she cannot live
a life without focus.

790
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,175
She stayed because of Booth.

791
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:29,474
Oh, now you're projecting,
Ms. Montenegro.

792
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,608
Agent Booth and Dr. Brennan
are not you and Dr. Hodgins.

793
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:37,085
- <i>I stand by my diagnosis.</i>
- You stand by the F.B.I.

794
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:40,612
Your first priority
is to get agents back into the field...

795
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:42,625
- solving murders.
- [Chuckles] Hmm.

796
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:45,287
Your romanticism is endearing,
but as the bard says...

797
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:48,661
"Lovers and madmen
have such seething brains...

798
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,757
<i>"such shaping fantasies...</i>

799
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:54,099
that apprehend more
than cool reason ever comprehends."

800
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:58,335
He also says, "Journeys end
in lovers meeting...

801
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,707
every wise man's son doth know."

802
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,712
[Chuckles]

803
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,580
- Excellent.
- You betcha, Monty.

804
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:10,916
- Mm, mmm, mmm. You are good.
- Mmm.

805
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,154
What's that mean?
