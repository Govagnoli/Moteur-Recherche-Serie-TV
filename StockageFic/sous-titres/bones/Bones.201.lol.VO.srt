1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:03,900
What did you do ?

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,300
I read, walked on the beach, chilled.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,200
Oh, you chilled, in Darfur.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,800
You chilled in Darfur ?

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,200
In North Carolina.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,000
I changed my vacation plans
to spend time with my brother.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,800
Ross and I talked about it and
we really wanna find dad.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,600
Okay, well, just so you know, the FBI's
gonna find your father,

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,700
no matter what you want.

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,800
My brother and i don't want the FBI
to backburner the search.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,500
is it okay to go over
on two wheels like that ?

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,500
Only when making very sharp
turns at high speeds.

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,900
Hey, Bones, why don't you have a little,
uh, you know, faith in me, okay ?

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,600
I'm not gonna backburner the case.

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,200
All right ?

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,300
I'm gonna find your father.

17
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,500
My brother said you'd say that.

18
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,600
You really keep saying "my brother" a lot.

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,300
Well, I lost ross for 15 years.

20
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,200
I like the sound of it.

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,300
My brother.

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,300
What's with the siren ?

23
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,100
Why are you driving like a maniac ?

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,800
Two passenger cars
off the tracks.

25
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,500
One on the side.

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,400
There's gonna be fatalities.

27
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,500
Stan ! I need some gauze !

28
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,900
Danny !

29
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,300
You don't find the owner of this in the
next ten minutes, he'll bleed to death.

30
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,500
Starting... now.

31
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,000
Seeley.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,200
Camille.

33
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,900
Don't call me Camille.

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,400
Don't call me Seeley.

35
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,300
Dr. Brennan.

36
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:33,700
Dr. Saroyan.

37
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,900
You two know each other, right ?

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,200
No.

39
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,200
Dr. Brennan, I'd like you
to check out the automobile

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,600
this train hit...it's probably
what caused the derailment.

41
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,100
Accidental ?

42
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,100
NTSB guy says the train struck a car
at least 200 yards from the nearest access.

43
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,800
Deliberate ?

44
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Eight minutes, Steve !

45
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,500
Probably suicide.

46
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,300
Why are you
still here, Dr. Brennan ?

47
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,100
Because I'm not a coroner,
and I don't work for you.

48
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,700
Well, you got that half right.

49
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,400
Dr. Cam.

50
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,300
Still breathing !

51
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,500
Thanks, Steve ! All right.

52
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Every survivor is one less
person for me to autopsy.

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,600
You look good out of your suit, Seeley.

54
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,100
But then, you always did.

55
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,700
Yeah. That's...

56
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,200
great to have you
back in D.C, Camille.

57
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,600
One minute she's holding a severed arm,

58
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,200
the next she's hitting on you.

59
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,100
No, she wasn't hitting on me,

60
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,500
and you know what ?

61
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,000
She is your boss, Bones.

62
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,400
No, goodman's my boss.

63
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,600
May I approach ?

64
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,100
All yours, Dr. Brandon.

65
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,500
Brennan. Dr. Brennan.
You want to guess my name ?

66
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,300
No, but there are thousands of you
in D.C and only one of me.

67
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,900
While you were away, goodman
decided that there should be

68
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,500
a head of forensics at the jeffersonian.

69
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,300
It....occurred to you
to check in, huh ?

70
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,700
Why didn't goodman hire me ?

71
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,900
Oh, my guess...
people skills.

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,400
You know, I have people skills.

73
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,200
Aw, all right. That firefighter's name
is Nelson.

74
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,200
It's at least the fourth time
that you've met him.

75
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Odds are Cam knows his kids'
names after meeting him once.

76
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,300
A lot of jewelry. Male.

77
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,700
Thigh bone suggests he was tall.

78
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,600
An I.D Bracelet.

79
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,700
It's good quality gold, slightly melted.

80
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,700
Too melted for a regular car fire.

81
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,000
Do you see a skull ?

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,400
Hey, Bones,

83
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,600
I'm not looking for a skull.

84
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,100
Burn damage in the body is more
intense than I'd expect from a car fire

85
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,100
even if the fuel tank ruptured and
was absolutely full at the time of impact.

86
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:19,700
Oh, I don't know.

87
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,400
Do you see anything on this car
that isn't ruptured ?

88
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,500
Booth, three deaths
in the first-class car.

89
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,900
Oh, homicide.

90
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,400
That makes it my case.

91
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
One of them's a Senator.

92
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,700
That makes a difference ?

93
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,300
Facts of life, Bones.

94
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,900
Apparently Cam is autopsying a Senator.

95
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,300
A Senator ? Oh, we're moving up in the world.

96
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,600
They have a past.

97
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,300
Cam and the Senator ?
Cam and booth.

98
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,800
Look how she touches his arm
when he laughs.

99
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,900
You touch my arm when I laugh.

100
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,300
No, no, you touch me.

101
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,800
It's a big difference.
Okay, what do we got ?

102
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Male, 40's, approximately
six foot seven, right-handed.

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,200
Six foot seven ?

104
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,600
Athlete in his youth.

105
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,300
Right shoulder is worn
from a repetitive motion.

106
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,600
Baseball pitcher maybe.

107
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,000
More like a...basketball.

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Basketball.

109
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,200
Mm, six foot seven...
it makes sense.

110
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,000
Every bone in his body is broken.

111
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,800
Dude, he got hit by a train.

112
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,200
"W-A-R."

113
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,100
It's all I can make
out of one name.

114
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,200
And then, "love, Briana."

115
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,500
Dude !

116
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,000
You're saying "dude" way too much.

117
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Forties, six foot seven, W-A-R, Briana ?

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is Warren Lynch.

119
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,600
Who's Warren Lynch ?

120
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,500
No way.

121
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,700
Warren Lynch ?

122
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,700
Lynchpin international Warren Lynch ?

123
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,200
Yeah.

124
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,300
I am not telling the press

125
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,100
that Warren Lynch killed Senator Paula Davis

126
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,600
before we're completely certain.

127
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,800
i know Senator Davis.

128
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,100
I signed a book for her
to give to her daughter.

129
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,900
Oh, man, I love Paula Davis.

130
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,600
She could of been President.

131
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,700
Warren Lynch and Senator Davis
killed in one accident ?

132
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,700
No way it's a coincidence.

133
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,900
Hey, hodgepodge...all engines reverse.

134
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,900
First we identify beyond the shadow of a doubt,

135
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,200
then we get paranoid.

136
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm cool. As long as paranoia
is on the schedule somewhere.

137
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,800
It wasn't suicide.

138
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Jagged edges to the breaks.

139
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,900
Small fragments,

140
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,600
a lack of circular
or radiating fractures,or adherent spurs.

141
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
What does that mean ?

142
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,900
This man was dead for several hours

143
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,200
before the train hit him.

144
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,200
We are tighter than
a nun's knees ononhis one.

145
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,500
No press, no conjecture
with anyone outside this room.

146
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,200
Why ?

147
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Because we are gonna find the details
of Senator Davis's death

148
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,700
without giving oliver stone
or Michael Moore any ideas.

149
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,700
Are we assuming Senator Davis's death
was a coincidence ?

150
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,900
You want to kill someone,

151
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,200
planting yourself
in front of a train...

152
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,400
probably not the best idea.

153
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,800
But too early to make
any assumptions.

154
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,500
I am a diuretic seagull, people.

155
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,600
Everything goes through me.

156
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,400
10:00 A.M. ?

157
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,600
Here ? Tomorrow ?

158
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,400
Zacharoni, your turn
to bring the doughnuts.

159
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,300
Zacharoni ?

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Cam noticed that I eat macaroni
and cheese everyday at lunch.

161
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,200
Every single day ?

162
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,800
You should be okay
with Dr. Saroyan

163
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,200
getting the head-of-forensics job.

164
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,800
Why is that ?

165
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,700
Because you are a strictly
rubber-to-the-road,hardball scientist.

166
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,800
You're not a flesh-pressing,

167
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,000
ink-stained,policy-making, wank-tard.

168
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,400
What are her qualifications ?

169
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,500
Chief coroner of new york for two years,

170
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,300
assistant federal coroner before that.

171
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,400
How am I doing ?

172
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,100
Very well. Impressive.

173
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,400
Brennan.

174
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,700
we were discussing her mother's case.

175
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,600
Fine.

176
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,100
Well, I'll be there in 15 minutes.

177
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,600
Yes. Good, Dr. Brennan.

178
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,800
We'll chat later.

179
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,400
It's a very interesting case.

180
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,200
Brennan identified skeletal remains
as her mother's,

181
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,000
killed by a blow to the head...initial
suspect was her father,

182
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
but in the end,we arrested a pig
farmer hit man in witness protection.

183
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,600
Added wrinkle, brennan
gets called...Dr. Hodgins ?

184
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,700
You're chattering me to
death 'cause you hope

185
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,300
i'll forget you called
me a wank-tard.

186
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,100
It's a made-up word.

187
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,300
No meaning.

188
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,600
My name is Lisa Supak

189
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,800
and I am the assistant U.S Attorney
attached to this case.

190
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,800
I'd like to hear first from the national
transportation and safety board, Mr. Hobbs.

191
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,600
Thank you. At 8:04 this evening,

192
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,200
a high-speed commuter train
struck a private vehicle.

193
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
The front car derailed,
killing three people,

194
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,900
including Senator Paula Davis.

195
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,800
Preliminary indications show
that the car was placed there purposely.

196
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,300
Dr. Brennan, was the jeffersonian able to confirm

197
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,000
that the driver of the car was Warren Lynch ?

198
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,400
Dental records and physical characteristics
establish that, yes.

199
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,900
The vehicle's registered
to Mr. Lynch.

200
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,700
We'll verify that the jewelry
found on his body was his.

201
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,400
Plus, we have this.

202
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,400
A photograph from the carpool lane ?

203
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,900
At 1:56 this afternoon,

204
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,800
Mr. Lynch drove illegally
in the diamond lane on I-270,

205
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,600
our good old maryland state police cameras,
they caught the infraction.

206
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,100
This is definitely the vehicle
found on the tracks ?

207
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,500
Nobody saw or heard from Warren Lynch
after this photo was taken.

208
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,800
You can't honestly expect
anyone to believe

209
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,000
that Warren Lynch committed
suicide by driving into a train.

210
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,100
Daniel burrows, securities exchange commission.

211
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,900
We were about to lead charges
against Mr. Lynch

212
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,800
that would not only
wipe him out financially,

213
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,900
but send him to prison
for several years.

214
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,000
I heard rumors, but for a man
like Lynch to kill himself...

215
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,900
Mr. Lynch did not commit suicide.

216
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,800
Dr. Brennan's examination
shows that he was dead

217
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,900
for at least six hours before
the train struck his car.

218
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,500
Dead how ?

219
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,100
I don't know that yet.

220
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,400
But can we assume that it was foul play ?

221
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,700
When it becomes public knowledge
that Warren Lynch is dead,

222
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,900
stock in Lynchpin International
is going to plummet.

223
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,600
Well, it sucks for the people
invested in Lynchpin

224
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
but otherwise...

225
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
that's motive for murder.

226
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,700
How is losing money a motive ?

227
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,200
It's called shorting a stock.

228
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,000
Uh, basically

229
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
you bet that the share price is gonna fall

230
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,300
and when it does, you collect.

231
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,500
How much we talking ?

232
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,700
Tens, maybe hundreds of millions.

233
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,700
Yes, these are Warren's things.

234
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,300
I bought him the I.D. Bracelet
on our first anniversary.

235
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,100
"Casu consulto."

236
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,500
What does that mean ?

237
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,600
"Accidentally on purpose."

238
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,900
Why do you know things like this ?

239
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,900
It was kinda my husband's motto.

240
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,400
Mr. Lynch wrote about it in his autobiography.

241
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,100
He played basketball in college.

242
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,900
Made it all the way in
the national championships.

243
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,300
Warren was the high scorer,

244
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,300
but a player on the other team
locked him out of the key.

245
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,900
Warren injured the opposing player,

246
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,100
sent him to the hospital,

247
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,600
and made it look completely inadvertent.

248
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,400
"Accidentally on purpose."

249
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,400
He wrote this about himself
as if it were a good thing ?

250
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,900
Well, you don't become Warren
Lynch by playing by the rules.

251
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,900
I'm still his wife so this
all comes to me now, correct ?

252
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,500
Still his wife, Mrs. Lynch ?

253
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,400
Are you and Mr. Lynch
having marital problems ?

254
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,000
Warren and I were separating.

255
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Why ?

256
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,700
Infidelity.

257
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
On who's part ?

258
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,100
I found out that Warren
was seeing someone only...

259
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,500
the someone turned out to be...

260
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,400
some dozen.

261
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,800
Mm. I'm gonna need a list.

262
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,500
When Briana confronted Warren,

263
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,300
he had a private investigator
look into her activities.

264
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,500
I admit, he didn't come up dry.

265
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,200
Private investigator's name ?

266
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,100
Rick Turko.

267
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,400
He was one of Lynch's
all-purpose, go-to, dirty-work fixer.

268
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah, I'm familiar
with rick turko.

269
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Thank you for your cooperation.

270
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,400
Cheating spouse stands
to inherit it all,

271
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,100
corrupt business practices
and turko the private dick.

272
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,800
Where do we start ?

273
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,500
Two types of glass were embedded
in what was left of Lynch.

274
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,300
Let's start with glass.

275
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,500
Tempered automotive safety glass
and silicate.

276
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,300
Tempered glass
came from the car windows.

277
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,200
What about the other ?

278
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,400
It's 70% amorphous silicone dioxide.

279
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
What's that ?

280
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,700
It's a common domestic container.

281
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,800
Oh, like a jar. Mm.

282
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,600
Why can't we just say "a jar" ?

283
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,500
Anything new, zackaroni ?

284
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,900
Zackaroni ?

285
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,200
The victim's left shoulder and elbow
we're badly dislocated postmortem.

286
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,300
You mean between the time he died

287
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,500
and the time he got hit by the train.

288
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,000
Blood flows nonexistent when
the dislocation occurred.

289
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,500
Okay, you guys do this stuff
and I'll start on turko.

290
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
What's that ?

291
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,800
A private investigator.

292
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,900
Turko's an affliction.

293
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,800
I'll set up a meeting and call you, okay ?

294
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,800
You shouldn't call me zackaroni.
Yeah, I knew that the moment I said it.

295
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,200
I'm going to get a bone mineral
density reading.

296
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,200
You didn't actually want
the job, did you ?

297
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,400
I don't even know
what the job is.

298
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,400
Well, Goodman will
explain his decision.

299
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,300
Goodman appointed dr. Saroyan

300
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,400
while I was on vacation

301
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,800
then took a two month sabbatical
to avoid me.That explains a lot.

302
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,500
All right, you know,

303
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,600
I think it's because
you are very task oriented.

304
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Zack. Task oriented is a euphemism
for lacking overall perspective.

305
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,500
Oh, no. No.

306
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,500
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, a little.
Like, when's my birthday ?

307
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,700
I could get the computer
to remind me about birthdays.

308
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,200
Oh, that's one of a gajillion examples.

309
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,600
You could tell me the other
gajillion minus one.

310
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,200
What do you see zack ?

311
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,700
Yeah, uh, bone loss.

312
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,200
Lack of bone density
suggests that Warren Lynch

313
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,500
is much older than his 40'S.

314
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,800
But the other indicators of age,

315
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,900
epiphysial rings, cranial
sutures, all disagree.

316
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,600
Age doesn't explain the
ossification of cartilage

317
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,200
where the ribs meet the sternum.

318
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,500
Well, what does explain it ?

319
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Opiates.

320
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,400
Warren Lynch was a heroin addict.

321
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,100
A private investigator.

322
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,600
My greatest asset is my discretion.

323
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,100
Briana Lynch already told us

324
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,000
that you worked for
her husband, Mr. Turko.

325
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,600
Well, Mrs. Lynch is welcomed
to say whatever she likes.

326
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,600
That client confidentiality routine
no longer exists when the client is dead.

327
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,100
That's not the assurance
i give my very demanding,

328
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,000
very high profile clients.

329
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,800
'Til death do us not part.

330
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,200
Yeah, how would your
very demanding,

331
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,700
very high profile clients feel

332
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,200
if they found out that, uh,
you procured heroin for Warren Lynch.

333
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,600
What ?

334
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,200
Warren Lynch
was a heroin addict.

335
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,700
I'm gonna open up
a drug investigation

336
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,300
on you, Mr. Turko...once

337
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,500
the press gets wind of that

338
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,200
your very high profile clients

339
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,300
will find some other
unprincipled Mr. Fix-it.

340
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,500
Warren Lynch was a junkie ?

341
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,100
What's your evidence ?

342
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,200
Bones.

343
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,200
So what does all this mean ?

344
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,600
Sum it up for the man, Bones.

345
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,900
Warren Lynch suffered declining

346
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,300
bone mass due to long term abuse

347
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,100
of his hypothalamic
pituitary gonadal access.

348
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,500
Nothing says junkie like your
gonads access, Ricky.

349
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,600
I had no idea.

350
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,100
And I certainly...procured
any heroin for him.

351
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,800
Warren Lynch sure as hell wasn't trolling

352
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,300
for ten dollar hits
in lincoln heights.

353
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,700
Come on, agent booth, you know my rep.

354
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,200
I'm a sin eater.

355
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,600
I make problems go away.

356
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,500
You mean like when Lynch's wife found out
that he was sleeping with other women.

357
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,100
all right, anything I say
strictest confidence, correct ?

358
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,700
Warren Lynch brought me in
to deal with a blackmailer.

359
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,200
Warren Lynch was being blackmailed ?

360
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,900
By one of his girlfriends ?

361
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,400
That would be my assumption, yes.

362
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,800
I paid them off before,

363
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,500
but this was a much
bigger deal, more serious.

364
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,000
Had to be the heroin, right ?

365
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,200
How'd it play out ?

366
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,600
Well, I negotiated
the payment down from a mil

367
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
to a quarter million, paid them off.

368
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,500
That was three days ago.

369
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,800
How ?

370
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,300
Dead drop at rock creek park.

371
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,500
And you have no idea who it was.

372
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,800
Well, I had a phone call,

373
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,600
I traced it back,

374
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,600
it dead-ended on a stolen cell phone.

375
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,000
You did a good job.

376
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,900
Given your heroin bombshell,

377
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,800
I went back to what tissue

378
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,200
remained and found traces
of laudanine and raticuline.

379
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,100
Alkaloids found
in the opium poppy.

380
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,700
I'd like Angela to do
a facial reconstruction.

381
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,500
Confirm my finding ?

382
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,600
It's handy having a pathologist
right in the building.

383
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,200
To turn opium into heroin,
it's exposed to hot acidic and hydride,

384
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,400
which produces 18 neutral impurities.

385
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,900
The ratio of these impurities indicates

386
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,800
the heroin's origin, in this case mexico.

387
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,200
Mexican heroin is very common.

388
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,100
I wonder if there's anything we can do

389
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,500
to narrow it down further.

390
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,600
Gas chromatography...

391
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
shows there was also
fetanyl in the heroin.

392
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,000
What's that ?

393
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,400
This reminds me
of when you interviewed me

394
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,600
to be your grad student.

395
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,600
She knows what fetanyl is.

396
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,400
It's a narcotic which boosts
the effects of the heroin.

397
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,200
According to Metro Cops,

398
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,500
14 addicts od'd this week
off this one shipment.

399
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,900
Have you told booth ?

400
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,100
I'll leave that to you.

401
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,000
How'd I do ?

402
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,600
I thought she
did quite well.

403
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,900
You said you had
something else to show me.

404
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,600
In a car fire gasoline vapor
ignites at 280 degrees celsius

405
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,200
and rises to a plain temperature
of 2200 degrees.

406
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
If the gas tank were
full at the time of impact,

407
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,300
the fire should of burned

408
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,500
for approximately 20 minutes
without intervention.

409
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,900
Tell me that's
not a real skeleton.

410
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,700
No, we made him out
of calcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite.

411
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,500
And spam.

412
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,100
20 minutes now.

413
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
It's still a significant
amount of spam.

414
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,500
And according to the fire
department report,

415
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,900
the car burned for 40 minutes

416
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,700
and it still took
four minutes to put out.

417
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,600
Which means
there was extra fuel.

418
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,300
And the extra glass you found ?

419
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,600
Five gallon mason jars.

420
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,300
Six of them.

421
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,600
Filled with gasoline.

422
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,400
Yeah, or moonshine.

423
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,100
Why does the whole lab

424
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,400
smell like a luau ?

425
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,900
zack and hodgins are proving

426
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,200
that there was extra
accelerant in Lynch's vehicle.

427
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,600
Using what medium ?

428
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,800
Artificial bone
covered with spam.

429
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,000
Turn this off.

430
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,700
Why wasn't I told about this ?

431
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,700
I encourage
independent inquiry.

432
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,100
Your encouragement does not
signify my authorization.

433
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,300
If it happens again
i will take action,

434
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,100
and I'm from new york,

435
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,500
which means that I will take new york
action, am I clear ?

436
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Not at all.

437
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
I'm from michigan.

438
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,900
Dr. Saroyan means she'll make us
watch musical theatre.

439
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,700
Wrong new york.

440
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,100
I'm more from the get mugged in broad
daylight tradition.

441
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,000
This is not a high school
science fair.

442
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,500
This is the jeffersonian institute.

443
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,600
Unauthorized experiments in
forensics will get you fired.

444
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,100
But we're hodgepodge and zackaroni.

445
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,300
And they work for me.

446
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,000
You know, what I'd really
like to do here

447
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,300
is enjoy a meeting of the minds.

448
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,000
But if you insist on an
organizational pyramid,

449
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,700
I will be at the top.

450
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,600
Spam.

451
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,900
Yup. There are mason jars
filled with gasoline in the backseat

452
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,700
intended to break when the train hit.

453
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,100
Mm, and they got this with spam ?

454
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,900
Yeah, spam.

455
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,600
And Cam, she got all
bent out of shape.

456
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,100
She wants to authorize
all experiments.

457
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,100
Great. You know,

458
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,800
zack and hodgins, they do an
experiment with fake Bones and spam.

459
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,500
Yeah, what is your spam fixation ?

460
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,800
Uh, defense lawyer hears
spam, he makes a joke,

461
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,500
the jury laughs and everything

462
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,400
we get from the jeffersonian
is framed as, uh,

463
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,600
goofy science, you know,

464
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,200
from a bunch of squints with no
connection to the real world.

465
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
That wouldn't happen.

466
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,900
Really ? And the time
you dropped the dead monkey

467
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,000
down the elevator shaft ?

468
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,100
No, that was to show...

469
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,900
okay, I take your point.

470
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,500
Look Cam's goal is a successful

471
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,200
prosecution in a court of law.

472
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,500
Same as mine and yours.

473
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,400
No, you're all about
finding the truth.

474
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,400
Okay, your words say good,
but your tone says bad.

475
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,500
So it's confusing.

476
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,100
Cam knows that too much truth
is just as bad as too little.

477
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,700
which is why she got the job.

478
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:25,900
Booth.

479
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
You know, Angela says

480
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,900
that you and Cam had a sexual relationship.

481
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,000
Does that effect your view of her ?

482
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,700
Patch me through.

483
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,000
Wildly out of line,

484
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,800
just so you know that.

485
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,500
When ?

486
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,900
Did you get the doer ?

487
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,300
personal prerogative is at the
heart of scientific inquiry.

488
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:41,900
Bones.

489
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,300
Thanks for the notification.

490
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,000
What ?

491
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,600
The man who was charged with
murdering your mother...

492
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,500
the pig farmer, vince mcvicar.

493
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,200
He was killed.

494
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,500
Today at Alexandria federal facility.

495
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,500
I don't...

496
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,900
he was the only connection to my father.

497
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,800
His trial was gonna be my...

498
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,800
how am I ever gonna find out
what really happened ?

499
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,700
That's not Warren Lynch.

500
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,100
How accurate is this thing ?

501
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,400
It's not the machine that's
accurate, it's Angela.

502
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,500
And she's good.

503
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,300
That is not Warren Lynch.

504
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,300
Hey, Zack provided a skull

505
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,300
and this is the face that goes with it.

506
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,900
You know, could it be the wrong skull ?

507
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,100
Zack doesn't make that kind of mistake.

508
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,900
He's also very good.

509
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,300
What about the dental records ?

510
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,800
I'll check them for a tampering.

511
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,700
But you're certain
that the body in the car...

512
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,400
is not Warren Lynch.

513
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,700
Absolutely certain.

514
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,600
the man in the car was
not Warren Lynch ?

515
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,700
No. No this was the man behind the wheel.

516
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,400
You had dental records.

517
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,100
Well, somebody digitized
Lynch's dental x-rays

518
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,200
and then re-filmed them,

519
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,600
utilizing authentic
alpha-numeric bar codes.

520
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Their records were expertly faked.

521
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,200
Then where the hell is Warren Lynch ?

522
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,400
I've informed the FBI

523
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,100
that they might want to start looking for him,

524
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,700
in the meantime,

525
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
we're moving to I.D. This guy.

526
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,800
Mistakes like this cannot happen

527
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,400
when the case concerns a dead Senator.

528
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,300
Ms. Montenegro uncovered a fraud,

529
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,500
that's the opposite of a mistake.

530
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,800
Save it for the press conference, Dr. Saroyan.

531
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,500
Thank you.

532
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,400
Hey, if you'd made a mistake,

533
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,600
I'd have thrown you to the wolves.

534
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,000
The metro cops hated the guy
pushing the mexican heroin,

535
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,600
laced with fentanyl is Eddie Bean :

536
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,700
Young guy,

537
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,800
baldy-headed,

538
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,300
five-five,

539
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
145 pounds.

540
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,300
You know, if drugs

541
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,000
we're legalized,

542
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,300
they could be dispensed
from a clean, safe,

543
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,000
controlled outlets,

544
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,000
by trained personnel,

545
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,900
not in alleyways,

546
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,800
by criminals.

547
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,200
Yeah... right.

548
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,100
Hey, that's our guy,

549
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:25,600
let's go !

550
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,300
Hold on ! Whoa ! Shh !

551
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,300
What we're gonna do

552
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,600
is we gotta wait until he deals.

553
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,200
Catch him in the act.

554
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,300
We wait ?

555
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,200
For how long ?

556
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,400
However long it takes.

557
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,300
Well, what do we do while we wait ?

558
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,900
This is a stakeout,

559
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,500
we converse.

560
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,900
Well, I tried to initiate
conversation on the drug war, but...

561
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:46,600
Oh, god. Fine.

562
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,000
You know what ?

563
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,400
Let's just...

564
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,700
talk about something
we're not going to argue about.

565
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,900
have you been out
to your mother's grave ?

566
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,200
Not since the funeral.

567
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:57,900
Really ?

568
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,700
Why would I ?

569
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,500
Well, to connect.

570
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,900
She's dead.

571
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,400
fine. You know what ?

572
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,400
Forget it.

573
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,700
"Dead," as in gone from this world ?

574
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,400
Excuse me.

575
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,300
I'm curious.

576
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,300
Um, do you talk to the headstone ?

577
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,100
I mean, what do you,

578
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:23,800
what do you say ?

579
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,200
It looks like I'm talking
to the headstone,

580
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,200
but what I'm really saying
is that...

581
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,200
forget about where the words are aimed.

582
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,700
What I say is that...

583
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,700
I remember them.

584
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,600
They can't hear you because they're dead.

585
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,100
My mouth moves, words come out,

586
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,400
but none seem to get across
the drawbridge to the princess,

587
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
I know who waits within.

588
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:52,900
We're on !

589
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,000
What princess ?

590
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:57,900
Hey ! Ho !

591
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,400
Hey, Eddie.

592
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,700
How you doing, Eddie ?

593
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,800
pockets...watch out for needles.

594
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,200
Don't you have to read him his rights

595
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:04,900
before you strangle him ?

596
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:06,900
Empty.

597
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,200
Okay, you know,

598
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:08,600
I had to hold his throat closed

599
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,700
so he wouldn't swallow the evidence.

600
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,000
If you bite me,

601
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,800
I will squeeze your little pin head off.

602
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Okay.

603
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,800
Okay, oh, easy.

604
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,100
There it is.

605
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,500
You shouldn't swallow heroin,

606
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,400
it's dangerous.

607
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,400
Great. Come on, Eddie.

608
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,100
Eddie...

609
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:28,900
Eddie ! Eddie, Eddie,

610
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,000
Eddie, Eddie. Hey, Eddie.

611
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,800
I'm gonna ask you a question.

612
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,400
Okay ?

613
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,200
You answer...you'll walk away.

614
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:34,800
All right ?

615
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,000
If you don't answer...

616
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,300
you book me, I get sick.

617
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,200
I know the drill.

618
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,000
If you don't answer...

619
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,700
I'm gonna cram this

620
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,800
back down your throat

621
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,100
without the protection.

622
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,600
All right. You sold some of this
crap to a tall guy,

623
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,900
over six-and-half feet tall.

624
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:51,800
Show him, Bones.

625
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,000
What ?

626
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,700
Show him.

627
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,600
I think that tall ?

628
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,800
Uh... nobody I know.

629
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,900
here. Come on, eat it.

630
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:03,700
Eat...that's it.

631
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,600
Get it in there.

632
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,400
That's it.

633
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:08,700
Ray !

634
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,300
Ray ?

635
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,700
Ray. Ray story.

636
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,500
Tell me about Ray. Huh ?

637
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,200
Everybody knows him down here,

638
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,200
man, he's a longtime skel.

639
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,500
When was the last time you saw him ?

640
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,300
He bought a stick of dynamite
about three days ago.

641
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,900
I feel I should alert you :

642
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,300
There's an additive in this
heroin that causes overdoses.

643
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,500
Well, thanks.

644
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,800
Hey, where'd you find her ?

645
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,000
Museum.

646
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,100
we should warn the addicts.

647
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,300
Yeah, like they do on a pack of cigarettes.

648
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,100
When ? Thanks.

649
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:38,600
What ?

650
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,600
They found Warren Lynch.

651
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,400
Mr. Lynch was thrown from a speeding car.

652
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,600
It's a minor miracle he survived.

653
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,700
It may be because he was
already unconscious at the time.

654
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:50,900
Unconscious ?

655
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,700
Yes.

656
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,900
Badly Beaten.

657
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,000
Internal bleeding,

658
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,300
broken ribs, both legs.

659
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
Some spinal damage.

660
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,600
Broken pelvis.

661
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,200
When can we talk to him ?

662
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,300
Any time you want.

663
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,600
As long as you don't expect a response.

664
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,800
This man has severe brain damage.

665
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
Off the record : He's not going to wake up.

666
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,500
Best case scenario :

667
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,200
He spends the rest of his life
hooked up to feeding tubes.

668
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,200
This is one of the richest men in the country.

669
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,300
Most of the time that might mean something.

670
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,700
Not now. Dr. Lawrence,

671
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,000
this man holds the key to how and why
Senator Paula Davis died.

672
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:25,600
I'm sorry.

673
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,400
Anything that man has in his head...

674
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,000
it's going to stay there.

675
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,200
Excuse me.

676
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,400
.... a hundred times.

677
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,900
It's important for us to explain

678
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,900
how the victim's shoulder
and elbow we're dislocated.

679
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,000
I recreated the most likely sequence.

680
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,100
The victim was dead when this happened.

681
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,300
He didn't feel it.

682
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,500
Run it again.

683
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,700
Almost like he was putting his jacket on.

684
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,600
Corpses don't usually do that.

685
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,200
These injuries occurred

686
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,600
when the corpse was forced into a jacket.

687
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,200
Yeah, most likely by two people.

688
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,100
Yeah, in a big hurry.

689
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,300
They had a train to meet.

690
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,500
You got anything on the H.O.V
Lane photograph ?

691
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,800
Yeah. It was relatively easy to get
the license plate numbers from these two cars.

692
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,200
Yeah, well...

693
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,000
I'll check 'em out.

694
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,000
Uh, there was another car.

695
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,100
In the next lane.

696
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,400
How do you know that ?

697
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,400
Well, rich guys keep their cars shiny.

698
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,700
Adjusting for the diffraction
of light caused by the curve...

699
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,400
it's a navigator.

700
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,200
But get this.

701
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,000
I don't know if that's of any use to you.

702
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,800
Yeah. That's of use.

703
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,700
Booth...

704
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,000
do either of these count as experiments ?

705
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,200
'Cause if they do,
we could both get fired...

706
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,900
by your old sweetheart.

707
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,900
you know, you just quit telling, Bones,

708
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,500
who you think I've slept with.

709
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,300
"Think" ?

710
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,000
What do you mean "think" ?

711
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,400
Two people forced a corpse into a jacket,

712
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,700
that's... excellent work.

713
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,000
Who's that ?

714
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,300
I think it's rick turko.

715
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,800
It means Turko's probably the last person
to see Lynch before he fell off the radar.

716
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,500
Of course, Angela and zack are scared
that this counts as an experiment,

717
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,000
and you are going to fire them.

718
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,300
Ah ! I am getting through.

719
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,200
Why did you take this job, Camille ?

720
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,400
Why shouldn't I, seeley ?

721
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,500
Because it's

722
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,300
basically herding cats

723
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,900
and you're a dog person.

724
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,800
Dogs herd cats.

725
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,500
Dogs don't do that.

726
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,400
Eh, chase 'em up trees, whatever.

727
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,900
Seriously, Cam, why did you take this job ?

728
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,400
These... are titanium
rib clippers from germany.

729
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,500
My last job ?

730
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,000
Used bolt cutters from home depot.

731
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,000
These are much, much nicer.

732
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,600
This autopsy table,

733
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,200
has down-draft ventilation
no rotting-corpse smell,

734
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:45,700
seeley.

735
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,900
My last table didn't even have a drain.

736
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,200
Think about that a second :

737
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
Leaky corpse, no drain.

738
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,500
So you took this job for better equipment ?

739
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,300
I've spent my whole professional life
in basement rooms with no windows.

740
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,500
Now I'm in the jeffersonian institute.

741
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,100
What ?

742
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,400
Gotta ask.

743
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,000
You so do not.

744
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,300
Did you take this job because of... ?

745
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,200
Oh, my god, the ego !

746
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,300
Go ahead, say it.

747
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,800
Nothing to do with you.

748
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,700
I need Bones this afternoon.

749
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:19,900
Okay.

750
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,300
It's about her mother's murder
and her father's disappearance.

751
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,900
Plus, she dedicated her book to you...

752
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,100
it's a legitimate case, Cam.

753
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,300
I know, I read the file.

754
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,700
Why hasn't she confronted me ?

755
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,600
About what ?

756
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,700
About me being parachuted in over her head.

757
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,600
Finds me intimidating, right ?

758
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,600
Hey, I intimidate people.

759
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,500
Yeah.

760
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,400
Bones doesn't intimidate.

761
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:48,800
Then what ?

762
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,400
Oh, you've seen the way
she stares at human remains

763
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,900
before she makes a decision.

764
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:53,800
Yes ?

765
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,300
You're human remains and
she hasn't made a decision yet.

766
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,500
How do I help her make
the right decision ?

767
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,700
Go for the truth.

768
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,400
Take care of her people.

769
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,700
Oh, and, uh,

770
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,300
I like the whole intimidation thing.

771
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
I think it's cute.

772
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,200
I got no reason to lie.

773
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,100
I'm facing life, at least

774
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,900
probably going to get executed.

775
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,800
What did you do ?

776
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,300
Mr. Downs killed his entire family.

777
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,500
I killed your friend

778
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,400
'cause he cut in the cafeteria line

779
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,000
and snagged the last orange juice.

780
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,300
Broke of a sharpened toothbrush
in his jugular.

781
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,600
Mr. Downs

782
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,400
the man you killed...

783
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
Mcvicar

784
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,600
...He's not my friend.

785
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,900
He killed my mother.

786
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,100
You come to tell me "thanks" ?

787
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,400
No. Mcvicar was my last chance
to find out some things.

788
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Mcvicar might have known
something about my father.

789
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,800
I can't ask my father

790
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,500
because he left a message
on my answering machine, telling

791
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,100
me to stop looking for him.

792
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,200
I'll tell you what...

793
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,700
maybe...

794
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:20,900
look at Mcvicar's murder
as a second message from Max,

795
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,700
one that he didn't use
the phone for.

796
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,400
I never mentioned

797
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,900
my father's
name was Max.

798
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,900
I'm done

799
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,700
Did you perform a hit
for Max Keenan ?

800
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,200
You performed a hit
for Max Keenan.

801
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,500
Take it as a sign from god.

802
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,400
How am I going to tell russ our father
order the death of another human being ?

803
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,900
If he did that...and I'm not
saying it happened that way...

804
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,700
then your father took down
the man who murdered his wife.

805
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,000
Good people don't have other
people murdered.

806
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,900
Good people don't even know how.

807
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,400
Your father buried your mother

808
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,400
in a pair of new shoes

809
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,200
in the cemetery, with her dolphin belt buckle

810
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,900
that reminded her of you
because you both love dolphins.

811
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,900
That does not make him a good man.

812
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,700
People can be more than one thing.

813
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,000
We were at a dead end,

814
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,100
okay ? Now we're not.

815
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,600
Okay. We know that your
father got to mitchell downs,

816
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,000
persuaded him to kill mcvicar.

817
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,100
We find out
how he did that,

818
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,800
we're that much closer to finding out
what happened to your old man.

819
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,500
I mean that's... if you still

820
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,400
want to find him.

821
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,900
I still do

822
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,600
Okay. Silver lining.

823
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,700
Warren Lynch
was in on it.

824
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,000
Where'd that come from ?

825
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
He had his own dolphin,

826
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,700
that's not lots of "a's"

827
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,400
national championship ring ?

828
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
His own dolphin.

829
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,000
All of the rest of his jewelry was removed
and placed on the dead man:

830
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,400
His $10,000 watch,

831
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,700
his I.D. Band from his wife,

832
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,700
his two other rings,

833
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,400
but not the championship ring.

834
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
That's good, Bones.

835
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
The only reason they wouldn't rip
it off his hands is...

836
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,700
...because Lynch

837
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,300
was calling the shots.

838
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,500
And I know exactly who was in on it.

839
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,800
So, Warren Lynch and I conspired
to disappear him for a few days

840
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,400
so that we could profit from shorting
Lynchpin stock ?

841
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,200
Well, you know, that's my thinking.

842
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,100
then dressed a junkie in Warren's clothes,

843
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,900
planted him in front of a train and... wait.

844
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,700
Did I murder the junkie ?

845
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,500
No, Bones said you probably found him dead.

846
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,000
But what I think is that

847
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,100
you and Lynch intended
a white-collar crime,

848
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,900
but a Senator died.

849
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,400
Then I got all hinky and I tossed Warren out

850
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,000
of the car at 80 miles an hour ?

851
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Is, is that a confession ?

852
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,400
No, no.

853
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,300
Just getting it straight.

854
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,300
You know, as a professional
investigator myself,

855
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,200
I have to point out that blackmailers

856
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,100
make much better suspects.

857
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,400
Lynchpin has no record of quarter-million
-dollar payout three days ago.

858
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,700
Well, there's not exactly a column
for blackmail payouts in the corporate books.

859
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,200
If I only agreed to the full payout,

860
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,800
Lynch might have...been taken
by those animals.

861
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,800
Hey, let's play a little show and tell, huh ?

862
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,100
'Cause we can put you with
Lynch moments before

863
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,100
he fell off the radar.

864
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,400
That's maybe me
before he fell off the radar.

865
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,600
We worked together.

866
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,200
You got nothing.

867
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:38,600
Booth. Do that lying thing.

868
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,800
Could you be more specific ?

869
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,100
Tell him Lynch woke up
and gave a statement incriminating him.

870
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,200
Turko knows the lying thing.

871
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,000
Tell him Lynch said something
only Lynch could say.

872
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,300
Ooh, great idea,
except for the "only Lynch could say it" part.

873
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,000
The ring ?

874
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,900
Ah, he'll ask for specifics of
the conversations.

875
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,700
I got to cut him loose.
He's going to get away with it ?

876
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,400
Well, you know, that
happens sometimes, Bones.

877
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,600
It's that brown little
smelly part of the job.

878
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,500
Shoulder and elbow.

879
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,000
The junkie's shoulder and elbow were dislocated
when they forced him into Lynch's jacket.

880
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,100
We don't know if Lynch was there for that.

881
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,000
It took two people.

882
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It was him.

883
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,700
Come on, booth.

884
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,100
Part of you with the big gambling problem
must love this idea.

885
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,500
Right there.

886
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,700
That's the reason
you didn't get Cam's job.

887
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,800
Oh, two against one.

888
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,100
That's unfair.

889
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,400
Warren Lynch woke up.

890
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,200
Ah, and he's talking, right ?

891
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,200
Huh ?

892
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,600
Is he pointing his finger
straight at me ?

893
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,500
That's correct.

894
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,400
What's he saying ?

895
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,900
He let you take all of his jewelry

896
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,200
except his championship ring.

897
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,800
No, I asked,

898
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,700
what did he say in words ?

899
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,600
Hey, unless I'm under arrest,

900
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,000
I'm leaving, folks.

901
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Mr. Lynch said it was difficult
getting his jacket onto the corpse.

902
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,900
Rigor mortis.

903
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,100
You have a train to meet.

904
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:58,900
You're in a hurry.

905
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,700
And the sound of the shoulder popping.

906
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,900
and elbow, like,

907
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,500
knuckles popping...

908
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,300
...only louder.

909
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,800
Sickening.

910
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,200
turko will admit to helping Warren Lynch

911
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,200
place a dead body in Mr. Lynch's car

912
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,200
and rigging it to burn

913
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,400
with the intent of moving the market.

914
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,600
Everything else, including
placing it on the tracks,

915
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,500
he says Lynch did on his own.

916
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,300
He's lying.

917
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,800
There's a small matter
of proving that in court.

918
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,600
What's the maximum sentence
on those charges ?

919
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,700
Ten years.

920
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,600
He killed three people.

921
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,100
And put one in a coma.

922
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,800
Yeah, but Lynch deserves to be in a coma,

923
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800
so it doesn't count.

924
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,400
All right, look, turko puts
all the blame on Lynch,

925
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,100
he does ten years

926
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,200
and he gets all the money
for shorting the stock.

927
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,600
It's ten years or nothing.

928
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,800
I can only work with what I'm given,

929
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,200
and the forensic work
on this was not good enough.

930
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,400
What ?

931
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,700
You were fooled by fake dental records.

932
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,900
You baked some spam.

933
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,300
What did you want us to do ?

934
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:14,800
Your jobs.

935
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,600
Hey !

936
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,900
No, Miss Supek,

937
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,000
you want us to do your job.

938
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,400
My people gave you
all the evidence you need

939
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,900
to fry turko with any reasonable jury.

940
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,600
Forensically...

941
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,800
we gave you everything
you need to arrest turko.

942
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,000
Arrest in not a conviction.

943
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,600
We definitely gave you
enough to reject

944
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,700
his plea bargain and indict him
in the wrongful death of a Senator.

945
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,300
Indictment is not a conviction.

946
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,700
You accept that plea bargain,

947
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,900
the investigation stops.

948
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,700
Indict him,

949
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,300
give us time to give you what you need.

950
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,400
If you accept this plea bargain,

951
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,200
you don't deserve to be a federal prosecutor.

952
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,300
Dr. Saroyan...

953
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,400
yeah, it's scary.

954
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,300
The whole country will be
watching the trial and you

955
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,800
don't want to go in with
less than a sure thing.

956
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,200
But you put my people
on the stand as expert witnesses

957
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,100
and that's a sure thing.

958
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,100
Not Zack.

959
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,600
You tell the story of what happened,

960
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,100
using the evidence these people provided,

961
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,900
and if you have any ability as a prosecutor,

962
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,600
you'll win the case.

963
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,800
Are you finished ?

964
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,700
No, Miss Supek.

965
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,700
In the future, when you have
problems with my team,

966
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,700
you register them
with me in private,

967
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,400
not by grandstanding
in a public forum.

968
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,000
Okay...

969
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,600
um, I sort of see why she got the job.

970
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,800
Well, looks like your brother was here.

971
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,800
...Understood the idea
of bringing flowers.

972
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,400
Just for once, Bones,
do what people do, okay ?

973
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,500
See how it feels.

974
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,200
Come on. That's it.

975
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,700
Now I'm gonna go stand over here

976
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,200
while you, you know,
talk to your mom.

977
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,800
I told you, I don't do that.

978
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,700
Mom, it's me, temperance.

979
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,100
I have questions,
but you can't answer them.

980
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,100
No offense, but I don't think
there's anything here of you

981
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,600
but your Bones, so...

982
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,600
I can't believe I'm doing this.

983
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,900
Is dad a good man or...

984
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,500
a bad man ?

985
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,000
He had someone killed.

986
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,900
Had him murdered and...

987
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,200
what's the truth ?

988
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,700
Do I...

989
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,200
do I keep looking
or do I let it go like he asked ?

990
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,500
Who's he protecting, himself ?

991
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,600
Or me and russ ?

992
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,300
Booth.

993
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,600
I asked the questions,
and guess what.

994
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,300
No answer.

995
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,800
Well, maybe if you weren't
standing right on top of her,

996
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,000
took a step to the left,
showed just a little respect.

997
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,500
Sometimes it takes a while
to get an answer, okay ?

998
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,200
Just leave the flowers.

999
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,200
I get answers at a lab,

1000
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,600
you get them from people.

1001
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,000
Nobody gets answers
from a slab of stone.

1002
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,300
Yeah, well, I see
an answer in the stone.

1003
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,800
See, you buried your mother
as christine brennan,

1004
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,700
the woman that you knew as your
mother and not by her real name,

1005
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,500
Ruth Keenan.

1006
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,200
That tells me who you are.

1007
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,100
What do you got ?

1008
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,400
A dolphin.

1009
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,200
What does that tell you ?

1010
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,300
What does that tell you ?

1011
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,700
My father was here.

1012
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,500
Because he loves your mother

1013
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,700
and grieves her loss

1014
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,900
and he came here to talk to her.

1015
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,500
You're tainting evidence.

1016
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,400
It's not that kind of evidence, Bones.

1017
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400
It's evidence of something else.

1018
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,500
Something that can't be tainted.

1019
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,800
It's beautiful.
