1
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,490
Oh,what happened?

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,330
Where am I?

3
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,250
Oh,come on!

4
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,090
Hodgins!

5
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,250
Hodgins,are you all right?

6
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,360
Can you talk?

7
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,420
Your legs.

8
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,250
What happened to your legs?

9
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,650
We're buried alive.

10
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,300
He must have got us.

11
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,100
Who?

12
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,870
The Grave Digger.

13
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,289
My superiors say to let you look at the...flying saucer.

14
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,390
It's not a flying saucer.

15
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,564
Well,it sure looks like one.

16
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,509
Local kids dirt-biking.

17
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,329
Something shiny poking from the dirt.

18
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,179
They dig it out,look in the window,see aliens.

19
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,270
Did you look?

20
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,580
Yes,ma'am.

21
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,949
Then called for backup. -Uh,why?

22
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,046
Well,on account of...well,they are aliens.

23
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,590
All right.

24
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,960
You want to take a look?

25
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,169
BOOTH: Are those what I think they are?

26
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,479
Yes.As long as you think they're two adolescent human males.

27
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,870
How long?

28
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:28,360
The amount of dehydrated tissue suggests the tank is sealed and intact.Years.

29
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,160
Two kids,huh?

30
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,959
I liked it better when they were aliens.

31
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,049
One set of remains shows trauma to the legs--

32
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,309
compound fractures,and his pelvis is broken in three places.

33
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,019
The other is virtually untouched.

34
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,165
Cause of death?

35
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,439
The amount of blood suggests that at least one of them bled out.

36
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,389
Probably the one with the injuries.

37
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,989
I've also noted a constellation of identical non-metric variants--

38
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,130
extra foramina.

39
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,549
BOOTH: Does that mean they were twins?

40
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,871
How did you know?

41
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,610
Matthew and Ryan Kent.

42
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,650
Kidnapped October 31,2001.

43
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,520
No one has seen them since.

44
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,209
<font color=#38B0DE>-=www.ydy.com/bbs=- Proudly Presents</font>

<font color=#38B0DE>Bones Season 2 Episode 9</font>

47
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,110
been positively identified as Matthew and Ryan Kent.

48
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,339
Come on,Peter,it's better than never knowing.

49
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,099
Agent Sanders,you were assigned to the Kent kidnapping?

50
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,390
Uh,Mr.Sanders-- I,uh,

51
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,749
retired from the FBI to pursue a career in general contracting.

52
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,640
Uh,when I'm sober.

53
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,819
Kim here was the Assistant United States Attorney attached to the case.

54
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,769
Still attached-- the file's still open.

55
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,799
The boys were snatched after a drinking party.

56
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,590
Was the ransom paid?

57
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,010
As the duly sworn representative of the FBI,I advised

58
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,089
Mr.Kent not to pay the ransom.

59
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,139
Unfortunately,the Kents listened to me and not the K&R guy,and,uh...

60
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,970
now their sons are dead.

61
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,760
K&R?

62
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,689
That's Kidnap and Ransom experts.

63
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,419
The Kent boys were the Grave Digger's third victims.

64
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,120
Third of the six we know of.

65
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,750
All together,four paid the ransom and lived.

66
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,869
And the other one that didn't?

67
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,150
Never found him.

68
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,369
That's why they call him the Grave Digger.

69
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,500
He takes people and he buries them.

70
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,659
You pay the ransom,and he tells you how to dig them up.

71
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,180
You don't,and,uh,you never see them again.

72
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,890
You won't catch him.

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,939
All due respect,uh,Agent Sanders,we have the beer vat and the human remains.

74
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,989
What are two dead bodies gonna tell you that four live victims couldn't?

75
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,949
Dr.Brennan,she's pretty good at,

76
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,959
uh,making dead people tell her things.

77
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,569
Look,my advice,talk to the K&R guy.

78
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,450
Kidnap and Ransom expert Thomas Vega,former FBI.

79
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,100
He literally wrote the book on the Grave Digger.

80
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,319
<i>I became a Kidnap and Ransom specialist.</i>

81
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,149
That's when I realized that the Bureau's policy

82
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,241
on non-payment to kidnappers is antiquated and dangerous.

83
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,249
You've dealt with the Grave Digger how many times?

84
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,760
In total,five.

85
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,499
Janine is a journalist-- she helped me write the book on the Grave Digger.

86
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,240
Next to me,she's the ranking expert on that...

87
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,860
Journalist,huh?

88
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,552
Oh,don't be like that,Agent Booth.

89
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,689
The Grave Digger is totally consistent.

90
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,109
No one ever sees the victim taken.

91
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,109
The ransom demand is made using a digitally altered voice.

92
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,559
A time limit is given.

93
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,710
There's never a second call.

94
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,679
As soon as the ransom is paid to a numbered untraceable account in Bahrain,

95
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,959
the Caribbean,et cetera,GPS coordinates are provided leading to the victim.

96
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,319
None of the surviving victims remembers anything before being taken?

97
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,350
Nothing.

98
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,919
Burn marks on the back of the neck suggest the use of a stun gun or cattle prod.

99
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,639
That'll scramble your brains pretty good.

100
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,479
Also,when you try to trace whatever container the boys were found in,you'll...

101
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,089
well,you'll reach a dead end.

102
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,749
He gets everything from landfills or cash auctions.

103
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,199
No last chance to pay up.

104
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,040
Never.

105
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,609
You know,most kidnappers are caught because they start negotiating the ransom.

106
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,499
The Grave Digger simply won't play.

107
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,089
I'm really not looking to help you write another book,you know...

108
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,809
<i>Capturing the Grave Digger.</i>

109
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:36,096
 VEGA: Agent Booth,I have seen what this guys does to families up close.

110
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,139
You know what,dislike me as much as you want,

111
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,444
but I'm still gonna help you,because I want this...caught.

112
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,890
You were kind of mean to them.

113
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,540
Thanks.

114
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,289
Zack,did you catalog this anomaly between C-1 and C-2 on Matthew?

115
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,969
Yes.If you increase magnification on the atlanto-axial joint,

116
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,320
you'll see calcining on the articular process.

117
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,420
Bone burn.

118
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,740
YES.Over 300 degrees.

119
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,660
Stun gun.

120
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,049
Does the same mark appear on Ryan?

121
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,520
No.

122
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,900
Okay.

123
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,589
Get the FBI to send you photos and medical am results of the Grave Digger's victims.

124
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,912
See if he uses the same stun gun every time.

125
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,900
Aluminum. Aluminum?

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,750
The Brits say "Al-yu-mini-um," but it sounds,well,British.

127
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:43,100
Manganese alloy,strain-hardened and stabilized,traces on both sets of clothing.

128
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,100
From the vat?

129
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,819
No,the inside of the vat is pure copper.

130
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:51,519
Both boys' clothing was stained with a sooty residue made up of lead and carbon,benzene and aldehydes.

131
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,820
Engine exhaust.

132
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,779
<i>Particulates from lots of engines,both gasoline and diesel.</i>

133
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,050
Parking lot?

134
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,720
Underground,probably.

135
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,229
Think that's where the Digger grabs his victims?

136
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,419
Compare your findings with the results found on the clothing of the surviving victims.

137
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,919
See if they share anything in common.

138
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,249
Measure oxygen volume in the vat,find out how long the twins survived.

139
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,569
I'll get right on it.

140
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:19,589
Mr.Kent,I'd like to start by expressing the Justice Department'ssincere condolences

141
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,609
for the death of your sons,Matthew and Ryan.

142
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,249
If I'd ignored the Justice Department and listened to Mr.Vega here,

143
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,199
paid the $2 million,my boys would still be alive today.

144
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,149
Sir,I understand your feelings towards the FBI.

145
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,370
I doubt that.

146
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,669
VEGA: Jim,Agent Booth here is investigating your son's murder.

147
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,649
Now,you know my problems with the FBI's approach to kidnapping,

148
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:45,580
but when it comes to,uh,finding killers,you want these people on your side.

149
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,410
Ryan and Matty were spoiled.

150
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,180
I know.

151
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,280
They,uh,partied,they chased girls,they,um...

152
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,010
they got expelled from school...

153
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,520
but they weren't bad kids.

154
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,610
And there's no way that they deserved suffocation.

155
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,800
Is it...painful?

156
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,370
Like falling asleep.

157
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,890
Mr.Kent,the Grave Digger lied to you and the FBI.

158
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,540
That's unlikely.

159
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,100
doesn't play games.

160
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,899
Mr.Kent,is there any way you could've put together the ransom in 12 hours?

161
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,999
Oh,no way in the world.

162
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,769
Which is exactly why the Grave Digger provided Mr.Kent with 24 hours.

163
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,380
His sons only had enough air for 12 hours.

164
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,670
Oh,my...

165
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,669
Even if you had ignored the FBI and listened to Mr.Vega,

166
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,169
you still wouldn't have been able to save your sons.

167
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,879
Your backstopping for the Bureau.

168
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,729
There were two of them in that vat.

169
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,740
They used up their oxygen twice as fast.

170
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,669
The Grave Digger miscalculated.

171
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,869
No,he doesn't do that.

172
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,949
Then it was never his intention that these boys survive.

173
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,114
He just didn't care,Mr.Kent.

174
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:05,610
So my decision to listen to the FBI,to not pay the ransom...

175
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,149
If you'd paid the ransom,your sons would still have been dead by the time you got to them.

176
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,819
There's nothing you could have done,Mr.Kent.

177
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,590
You're in no way responsible for the death of your sons.

178
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,129
Has it occurred to you that God is a lot like the Grave Digger?

179
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,660
What?

180
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,369
He lays down the rules,no way to question Him or notiate,

181
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,159
then it's almost as though He doesn't care how it works out.

182
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,009
Either you do as He says,

183
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:42,459
make some sacrifices and are delivered or you don't and you end up in hell.

184
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,629
You know what?I'd appreciate if you didn't say things like that,

185
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,069
because I really don't want to get struck by lightning.

186
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,119
Do you go to church every Sunday? Yes,I do. -

187
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,669
Can I come with you?No,you can't.

188
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,279
Why?It might help me to understand.

189
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,439
I am not going to help you disrespect God in His own house,okay?

190
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,539
If you want to do some kind of,you know.anthropological study

191
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,397
you know,turn on the Religious Channel.

192
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:05,629
Each of these contain one of the Grave Digger's victims. -cozy.

193
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,809
We also provided your people with the clothes that each victim was wearing.

194
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,809
Regarding the clothing,every one of them shows traces of aluminum and sooty residue.

195
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,809
We know each victim was taken from an underground garage beyond the reach of security cameras.

196
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:22,309
The typical kidnap-for-ransom profile is middle-aged in a job that's beneath him.

197
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,939
Smart guy who's an underachiever and someone who enjoys control over somebody else's life.

198
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,559
There's just one problem.

199
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,760
What's that?

200
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,639
See,there's nothing typical about this guy.

201
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,358
Don't expect him to fit the profile.

202
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,969
Okay,the dimensions of the vat-- six feet wide by eight feet tall--

203
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,949
make it impossible for Matthew Kent to have fractured his brother's pelvis.

204
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,029
Even if Matthew knocked Ryan down and,you know,stomped on him?

205
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,573
Cam and I agree the fracture was the result of one hard blow.

206
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,989
A break like that would require a lot more force than Matthew could have generated

207
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,969
All right,so you're saying that Ryan was injured before he went into that vat.

208
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,589
Yes.With the amount of blood on the floor,

209
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,659
it can't be explained by his injuries alone.

210
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,780
What?

211
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,380
It was a mistake.

212
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,540
What was?

213
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,639
Look,he intended to take one boy,but he ended up with two.

214
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,669
That's why they died 12 hours ahead of schedule

215
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,929
If he intended to take two boys,

216
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,709
he would have put them in a container twice as big,all right?

217
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,679
The Grave Digger,he messed up.

218
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,349
He snuck up on Matthew,knocked him uncocious whatever,

219
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,029
and Ryan was there,he shows up and he fought the y.

220
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,700
No,Booth,not fight.

221
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,949
The leg damage,the fractured pelvis.

222
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,059
These injuries are classic human versus car.

223
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,009
Ryan interrupts the kidnapping of his brother...

224
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,059
And the Grave Digger runs him down.

225
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,460
It was a mistake.

226
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:45,049
The Grave Digger is not God,Bones,because God does not make mistake Mm,I don't know.

227
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:49,379
Putting testicles on the outside didn't seem like such a good idea.

228
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,050
Commercial stun gun,625,000 volts,still not enough.

229
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,389
Well,it sounds like a lot of volts.

230
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,959
Actually,it's the amperage that does the real damage.

231
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,289
But still,I've checked every commercial stun gun I can find,

232
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,759
and none of them generate the right amount of power to make those distinctive marks on the bone.

233
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,000
Well,what about a cattle prod?

234
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,789
Stun guns generate a lot more power than cattle prods.

235
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,069
If you haven't figured out the stun gun,

236
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:18,159
then I am this week's king of the lab,because I found something huge.

237
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,360
You compete to be king of the lab?

238
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,060
No.

239
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,760
Hey,Angela.I didn't know that you were...

240
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,240
This sucks.

241
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,109
I'm gonna go catch Brennan then bolt for the night.

242
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,470
She just left.

243
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,910
Hey...

244
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,040
Could you stop being so weird,please?

245
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,612
It's making me very uncomfortable.

246
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,519
You should give him a chance.

247
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,280
Excuse me?

248
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,952
I apologize.I didn't say anything.

249
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,560
Dr.Brennan!

250
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,219
What do you say we go to New York for the weekend?

251
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,370
I don't know.

252
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,755
Come on.We're two adults with no obligations.

253
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,530
Let it go to voicemail.

254
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,390
We're not cheating.

255
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,049
We're not hurting anybody,Seeley.

256
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,129
Then why are we keeping our relationship such a secret,amille?

257
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:37,889
Because we work together and we're professionals and it's nobody's business,that's all.

258
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,349
So,come to New York.

259
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,690
Oh,sure,we'll go to a musical.

260
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:47,790
Talking and singing and talking and dancing and more singing,you know?

261
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,989
If you want to stop,what we're doing,just say so.

262
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,819
You can fantasize about pulling out your gun and shooting everyone on sge.

263
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,549
You know you like that.

264
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,209
Seriously,we'll do something that you like

265
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:03,309
,like climbing the outside of the Empire State Building or swimming the East River or...

266
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,740
What?

267
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,580
What happened?

268
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,509
Temperance Brennan,Jack Hodgins have been buried alive.

269
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:16,819
Wire transfer $8 million to the following Grand Cayman account,

270
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,900
or they will suffocate to death.

271
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,409
ceipt of the wire transfer,

272
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,329
I'll provide you with Brennan and Hodgins' GPS coordinates.

273
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,729
This will be my last communication.

274
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,619
It will be his last communication,too.He's never varied.

275
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,589
He learned from the Kent boys.He got two of them.He cut the deadline in half.

276
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,159
Why is the Grave Digger demanding so much money?

277
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,299
It doesn't make any sense.

278
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,619
He's always been reasonable at knowing how much money people could raise within the time limit.

279
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,269
Has Dr.Brennan made that much money from her books?

280
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,610
It's Hodgins.

281
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,849
He's the sole heir to this thing called the Cantilever Group.

282
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,108
And what's that?

283
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,329
Just the third-largest privately owned corporation in the country.

284
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,070
Make sense now,Tom?

285
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,939
I was on my way to karate class,so we have lots of bottled water.

286
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,460
What happened?

287
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,650
Where are we?

288
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,479
Last thing I remember is being at the lab.

289
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,980
I'm really confused.

290
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,950
What happened to my legs?

291
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,160
Where are we?

292
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,000
Underground.

293
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,450
Buried.

294
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,250
I have a burn.

295
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,549
Zack was trying to figure out what kind of stun gun.

296
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,170
It has to be the Grave Digger.

297
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,959
I think he ran you down with his car

298
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,399
and then pumped you full of drugs to ruin your short-term memory,same as Ryan Kent.

299
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,130
How long have we been down here?

300
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,550
maybe two hours,I think.

301
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:50,520
Okay,so this vehicle has,say,60,60 cubic feet of air.

302
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:55,060
That's 20% oxygen,two people.

303
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,769
My brain is not working.

304
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,500
The Grave Digger is very consisnt.

305
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,410
If we started with 12 hours of air,we'll be unconscious in ten.

306
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,440
After that,if...

307
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:12,290
if no one pays the ransom...

308
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:15,080
We're dead?

309
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,529
How are we going to get our hands on $8 million?

310
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,119
Hodgins is rich. -He is?

311
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,199
"Rich squared to the power of ten times four" is how he describes it.

312
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,919
You're gonna pay the ransom,right?

313
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,919
FBI standard ops,they won't work.

314
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,809
Grave Digger operates outside statistics.

315
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,089
-They'll fire you. -That's cool.

316
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,609
One less reason to wear a suit.

317
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,419
How'd the Grave Digger catch Brennan and Hodgins together?

318
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,209
Bones was on her way to karate.

319
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,099
And Hodgins said that he found something huge.

320
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,340
He tried to catch Dr.Brennan.

321
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,740
Here!

322
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,880
Oh,my...

323
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,899
Oh,that's blood,isn't it?

324
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,089
It'll turn out to be Hodgins'.

325
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,479
Dr.Brennan doesn't like it when we jump to conclusions.

326
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,139
I'm sure she'll appreciate we're on a deadline.

327
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,349
Look,Hodgins interrupted the kidnapping,just like Ryan and Matthew.

328
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,769
The Grave Digger must have run him over.

329
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:09,919
What are we gonna do?

330
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,119
Well,it's a crime scene,right?

331
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,050
They'll look for tire tracks,they'll check the security cameras.

332
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,050
I need you to be Dr.Brennan.

333
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,139
I don't know what that means. It means keep working the case.

334
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,749
All right,I need to know why Hodgins was chasing after Bones.

335
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,469
I'll look at his notes. What about me?

336
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,449
Call Bones' brother Russ and tell him what's going on.

337
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,754
I'm gonna go talk to the chairman of the Cantilever Group.

338
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,710
We have water,towels,my mini kit,ibuprofen,

339
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:43,019
two cell phones with no batteries,a digital camera with a backup battery,and,uh...

340
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,740
a handful of pens.

341
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,679
That one's a laser pointer.

342
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,620
And,uh,a copy of my novel.

343
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,437
Hey,we can read it to each other if we get bored.

344
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,430
"Deep Rhapsody.

345
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:59,900
" Careful,that's three grand a quarter ounce.

346
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:04,870
Yeah,I'd make that face,too,if I spent $3,000 on perfume.

347
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,060
Oh,man!

348
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,720
Something...

349
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,230
My leg!

350
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,490
Okay,here,here.

351
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,036
I'm worried you have compartment syndrome.

352
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,480
Is that terminal?

353
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,719
I mean,within the next few hours?

354
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,310
No.

355
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,430
But?

356
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,840
It's gonna get painful.

357
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,130
More painful than now?

358
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,000
Slip-into-shock- and-die painful.

359
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:38,310
Well,there's nothing we can do about that.

360
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,800
Actually,there is.

361
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,750
Oh,I'm not gonna like this,am I?

362
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,669
What are you doing?

363
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:55,069
The Grave Digger modified a commercial stun gun to knock out his victims.

364
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,989
I figured out the voltage and amperage,

365
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,564
but not how he modified it to boost the current.

366
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,589
Which will not help us find Dr.Brennan and Hodgins.

367
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,489
I did figure out how Ryan Kent died.

368
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,622
Let's hear it.

369
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,749
He killed himself.He punctured his own carotid artery,

370
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,759
which explains the amount of blood we found in the vat.

371
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,829
He used a pen.There's a nick on the inferior angle of the mandible.

372
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,909
I don't know why he did it.I don't really do "why.

373
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,520
" I just do "how.

374
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,139
" He did it to give his brother more air,so his twin would survive.

375
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,869
That's why we found them holding each other.

376
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,049
How does that help?

377
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:34,639
When we tell Mr.Kent that one of his sons gave his own life in an effort to save his brother,

378
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,180
it'll mean something,Zack.

379
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,300
Just keep searching,okay?

380
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,280
Okay,I'm ready.

381
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,648
Was that a note to Angela?

382
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,590
Yeah,just in case.

383
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,910
If whatever you're gonna do to me sends me into shock,I might die.

384
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:13,200
Upside: me not breathing doubles your survival time.

385
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,860
I'm not interested in surviving that way.

386
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:23,369
What I'm going to do is make a long incision in the fascia to release the pressure inside.

387
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,410
And how...how long is a long incision?

388
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:29,059
Wait.You know what?Don't tell me.

389
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:34,450
It's best if I do it very fast and without empathy.

390
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,420
Here.

391
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,180
Hang on to something,d don't fight passing out.

392
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,780
Ready?

393
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,220
What is that?

394
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,569
Evidence of what happened to you.

395
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,225
Let's...let's worry about it later.

396
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,500
Here,just...

397
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,879
Put it in the pages of your book.

398
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,170
I'll take a look at it later.

399
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,014
It's best if you don't talk right now.

400
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,080
I'm nuts about Angela.

401
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,060
Over the moon.

402
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,580
Stupid in love with her.

403
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,469
That's why I bought her that...

404
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,360
that crazy,expensive perfume.

405
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,410
A man gives you a bottle of perfume like that,it says...

406
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,420
it says,"I love you.

407
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,380
" There.

408
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,750
I said it out loud.

409
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,384
Did you find Russ?

410
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,429
He's on a fishing trip with friends in the White Mountains.

411
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,500
No phone,no cell service.

412
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,880
You?

413
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,449
Hodgins seems to write everything in some kind of code.

414
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,859
I might have to get Zack over here to break it.

415
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,369
It says that the traces of aluminum found

416
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:38,589
on the clothing were almost certainly from t|| kidnapper's vehicle.

417
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:43,350
Like a box in the back of a trunk or a van.

418
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,750
You can read that?

419
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,520
Hodgins sends me a lot of notes.

420
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,490
Why bother with all of this?

421
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,699
We don't need evidence.

422
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,150
We need millions of dollars.

423
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,969
I can't get the ransom together-- not in time.

424
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,839
The Cantilever Group has got this policy--

425
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,920
no proof of life from the kidnapper,no ransom.

426
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,349
Not even for the boss? -It's his rule.It's no exceptions.

427
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:21,839
We need more time,except the Grave Digger doesn't give us that or proof of life.

428
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,269
Booth,I don't think it's a coincidence that he took Brennan when he did.

429
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,114
I was kind of thinking the same thing.

430
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,870
Thank God I didn't kill you.

431
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,219
How long was I unconscious?

432
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,350
For a while.How's your leg?

433
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,740
Better.

434
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,079
Lots better.What are you doing?

435
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,909
Hot-wiring the phone to the horn,so we can send a message.

436
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,300
From underground?

437
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,969
We get radio reception.

438
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:55,839
Direct current 12-volt will burn out the circuits in a 4.2 volt cell phone in a microsecond.

439
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,659
Better jury-rig a resistor.

440
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,959
Smart. --Might work long enough to send a single-burst transmission.

441
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,979
Very short text message.Booth can trace it to a cell phone relay tower.

442
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,370
What message shall we send?

443
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,790
"Good-bye"?"Nice to know you"?

444
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,259
What are we surrounded by?

445
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,860
Pain.

446
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,890
Despair.

447
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,626
And a subsoil accumulation of agglutinate aridosols.

448
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,770
Dirt.

449
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,659
I don't like the term "dirt.

450
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,700
" All right.

451
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:31,003
Tell me something I don't know.

452
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,280
Ash.

453
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,640
Hints of nitrogen and sulfur.

454
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,090
So where are we?

455
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,849
We're in coal country.

456
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,000
Bituminous coal country.

457
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,630
Basically...

458
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,320
Virginia.

459
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,490
We need more that that.

460
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,510
The laser.

461
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,040
And we need benzophenone.

462
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,760
Benzophenone...

463
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:06,620
It's in soaps,in plastic packaging,sunscreen.

464
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,410
We don't have any sunscreen.

465
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,760
Angela's perfume.

466
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,580
Three grand that cost.

467
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,929
Hodgins,I will split the cost when we get out of here.

468
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:22,076
There's something you don't know about me.

469
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,550
I'm rich.

470
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,540
Me,too.

471
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:31,420
No,no.You're well-off.

472
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:38,190
My family owns the Cantilever Group,and there's not many of us left alive.

473
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,170
One,to be exact.

474
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,920
Me.

475
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:46,460
<i>Okay,I won't split it with you.</i>

476
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,240
Smells nice.

477
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,810
I need the camera.

478
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,790
Okay.

479
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,140
I know where we are.

480
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,245
There's no negotiating with the Grave Digger.

481
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,149
You've been through this,what,five times with this guy?

482
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,510
Exactly.So I know him.

483
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,319
And he does not negotiate.

484
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,159
What?No chat room action with him?

485
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,390
Are you nuts?

486
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,960
I hate the ...

487
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,140
Why?

488
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,689
He's made you rich.

489
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,249
You know what?Youust need to deal with the facts.

490
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,629
If you can't put the ransom together in the time he gave you,

491
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:50,370
your partner is dead.

492
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,149
Here's the deal,all right?

493
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:57,729
You have a relationship with this guy-- what they call symbiotic-- you benefit from each other.

494
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,040
So know this,huh?

495
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:03,979
That deadline comes around,and my partner is still underground,

496
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:08,560
I will end you,you understand?

497
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,160
Three hours to live.

498
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,810
Better hurry.

499
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,289
This thing you found in my leg is anodized plastic film .

500
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:33,764
and coated metallic tape with dried-out adhesive

501
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,549
I think it's a bumper sticker.

502
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,779
You mean like,"If you can read this,you're too close"?

503
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,330
No.Like a prepaid toll road pass.

504
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,400
Someone ran me down with a car.

505
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,969
We knew that already.

506
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,799
Yeah,but now we've proved it,and I find I'm really annoyed.

507
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,549
Four to six seconds to enter message and hit speed dial.

508
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,229
I figured out a text message using eight key strikes.

509
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,089
How's your text messaging?

510
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,100
Thumbs like lightning.

511
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,840
I can do it.

512
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,880
Okay.

513
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,980
You ready?

514
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,230
Did it go?

515
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,180
I think it went.

516
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,260
Me,too.

517
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,610
Does it mean anything to anybody?

518
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,529
They're getting low on oxygen.

519
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,590
Hypoxia leads to mental confusion.

520
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,590
It's Bones.It means something.

521
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,289
Did you try just dialing the number?

522
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,219
I tried all the dumb guy normal stuff,okay?

523
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,199
That's why I'm here talking to the brain trust,all right?

524
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,670
Think,eggheads!Work it!

525
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,409
Booth,they're not cops.

526
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,369
We're running out of time.Minor correction.

527
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:04,980
Dr.Brennan and Hodgins will run out of air in four seconds.

528
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,840
We are out of time.

529
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,980
How much extra time?

530
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,160
A little.

531
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,456
Four other tires,but we can't get to them.

532
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,739
Is there anything else?

533
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,429
If the ransom was paid,we'd be out by now.

534
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:41,279
Why prolong the inevitable?

535
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,920
Booth will find us.

536
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,529
You have a lot of faith in Booth.

537
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,990
No.

538
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,870
Faith is an irrational belief in something that is logically impossible.

539
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,149
Over time,I've seen what Booth can do.

540
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,590
It's not faith.

541
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,390
No offense--

542
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,559
and I'm not just saying this because you filleted me with a knife--

543
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,950
we're out of air,we don't know if our message got out,

544
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:10,840
much less if anyone understood it,and we are buried underground.

545
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,420
What you have is faith,baby.

546
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,980
Sorry.The "baby" thing is a reflex.

547
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:20,400
You shouldn't talk right now.

548
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,990
To conserve air.

549
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,519
I need the camera batteries and the preservative powder from your kit.

550
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,970
Soda ash and lithium?

551
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,389
You're going to make a carbon dioxide scrubber?

552
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,800
If you can perform surgery out of thin air,

553
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:43,850
then I can pull a little thin air out of thin air.

554
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:49,009
Okay,Zack figured out what stun gun the Grave Digger uses,and how it's modified.

555
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:53,469
Thanks to Angela,we know that the Grave Digger has a customized aluminum case in the back of his vehicle.

556
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,139
I got about 100 agents working that angle.

557
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,259
What does this mean right here?What does that mean?

558
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,309
You're forgetting something.Brennan and Hodgins are out of air.

559
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,679
Great,you want to give up?

560
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,909
This is Bones we're talking about,and Hodgins.

561
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:06,569
You really think they didn't find a way to extend their air supply?

562
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,149
They found a way to send us a message-- ask us for help.

563
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,170
And you want to give up because of math?

564
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,030
Soda ash.Lithium.

565
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,859
Reacts with high concentrations of carbon dioxide.

566
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,720
Produces oxygen.

567
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:29,470
That gives us just long enough.

568
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,389
Just long enough for what?

569
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:34,108
For my next idea,which will kill us.

570
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,110
Air bags.

571
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,759
They aren't actually bags of air.

572
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,519
I'm not looking to extend our survival underground.

573
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,669
I'm looking to blow our way out of here.

574
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,527
Using the explosives from the air bags?

575
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:50,150
That could definitely kill us.

576
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,610
So will doing nothing.

577
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,835
Anyone you want to say good-bye to?

578
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,299
It's not a numerical-alphabetical code or an equation...

579
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,349
It's not GPS coordinates or indications of topography...

580
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,489
Then what is it? -Can I make a suggestion?

581
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,269
See,this is exactly why I was sent here.

582
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:31,589
You guys are brilliant,but you won't make intuitive leaps.

583
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,009
You mean jump to conclusions?

584
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,419
That's exactly what I mean.

585
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,479
This is a message from one of them to one of us.

586
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,150
Specific,focused.

587
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,999
Who was it meant to get to? --Easy,Brennan's cell to mine,right?

588
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,639
The message was for me.We have an understanding,we work together.

589
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,079
We all work together.

590
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,689
She's my best friend.

591
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:50,640
And Hodgins...Hodgins...

592
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,640
She's right.

593
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,999
We should assume the message is from Hodgins,not from Brennan.

594
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,060
Why?

595
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,180
Because they're buried alive.

596
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,979
And Hodgins is all about dirt.

597
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,819
Okay,great,the message is about dirt,but who is it to?

598
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,360
Angela.

599
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,579
Hodgins is all about dirt and Angela.

600
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,266
But it's numbers,Zack.

601
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,740
It's for you.

602
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,059
Hodgins would have written me a line of poetry or something.

603
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,600
Agent Booth.

604
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,309
Justine used her contacts and got me on all the local news shows.

605
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,999
I explained that we needed more time.I asked him to call.

606
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,569
I'm sorry,but he's completely consistent.

607
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,520
6-7-16.

608
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:25,109
Carbon,nitrogen and sulfur on the periodic table of elements.

609
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:28,060
They are buried in coal-rich soil.

610
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,479
You got to narrow it down,Zack.

611
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,688
Keep going,Zack.

612
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,739
The mineral components in coal are all the same.

613
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,419
It's the organic components that provide a unique fingerprint.

614
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,170
They're called "macerals.

615
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,039
" They fluoresce at different levels.

616
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,695
A reflectance of 1.4 is quite rare,

617
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:48,100
suggesting a high concentration of Inertinite.

618
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,749
Zack,tell me what that means.

619
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,639
It means he knows where they are.

620
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,380
Zack?

621
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,970
I know where they are.

622
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,979
Can this possibly work?

623
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,249
I'm not really an explosives expert,

624
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:09,059
but the dash might shape the charge enough to blow out the windshield.

625
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,970
If we're less than four feet beneath the surface,

626
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,369
this charge could blow us to freedom.

627
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,299
And if we're buried more than four feet deep?

628
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,470
Then the concussion will turn our brains into jelly.

629
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,550
Well,then we can run for congress,so it's a win-win.

630
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,059
We should get as far away from the explosion as possible.

631
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,690
I already am.

632
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,540
xxxxxxxxxxx

633
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,399
Okay,people,listen up.

634
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,209
I need everyone to look for any signs of recent digging.

635
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:15,075
Freshly overturned dirt,tire tracks,mounds,depressions.

636
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,960
Ready?

637
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,990
Dr.Brennan...

638
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,910
It's been a privilege.

639
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,350
hogies...

640
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,390
come on.

641
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,319
I went to visit you at the hospital.

642
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,850
I brought you this.

643
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,990
They...they let me go home.

644
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,390
No,they didn't.

645
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,970
You left without being discharged.

646
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,929
You stole crutches which I had to pay for.

647
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,379
They packed me...pumped me full of antibiotics,

648
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,339
stitched me up and gave me painkillers.

649
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,541
So...so I'm-I'm good to go.

650
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,920
Could you please look at me?

651
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,530
You were buried alive.

652
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:25,030
You were operated on without an anesthetic.

653
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,550
You were pumped full of drugs.

654
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:30,480
You really should be lying down.

655
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,780
He's out there,Angela.

656
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,370
He buries people alive.

657
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,230
I have to catch him.

658
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:44,999
If I can figure out the exact alloy of aluminum,then maybe I could...

659
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,130
maybe we could...

660
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:50,569
Plus the bit of-of-of...bumper sticker that Brennan found in my leg...

661
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,759
We're going to catch him,okay?

662
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,810
I promise you.

663
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,009
We're going to start tomorrow.

664
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:59,740
All of us together.

665
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,010
I can't sleep,Angela.

666
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,839
I thought that they gave you something for that.

667
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,940
No,I mean I'm afraid...

668
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,559
that if I close my eyes,when I...

669
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:20,120
when I open them I'm going to be back in that car,buried,running out of air.

670
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,350
Okay.

671
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,230
Then you should come home with me.

672
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,840
What?

673
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:36,440
When you open your eyes,I'll be there.

674
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,640
Yeah?

675
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,440
Yeah.

676
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,310
Okay.

677
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,490
You know I'm good for that crutch money.

678
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,930
What'd you ask for?

679
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,920
That's between me and a certain saint.

680
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:20,669
Although I did ask for a little help finding the Grave Digger.

681
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,840
Good move.

682
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,730
What's that smell?

683
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,370
The candles.

684
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:31,690
And I said thanks.

685
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,359
You should try it sometime.

686
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,949
If I were going to pray,I would've done it just before we set off the explosion.

687
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,320
And you didn't?

688
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,830
No.See,if there was a God,which there isn't...

689
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:46,570
Do you see where we are?

690
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:50,309
And if I were someone who believed He had a plan...

691
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:51,820
Which I do.

692
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,969
Then I'd be tempted to think He wanted me to go through something like

693
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:59,800
I went through because it might make me more open to the whole...

694
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,490
concept.

695
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,760
Which obviously it hasn't.

696
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:09,061
I'm okay with you thanking God for saving me and Hodgins.

697
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,990
That's not what I thanked Him for.

698
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:17,630
I thanked Him for saving all of us.

699
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,130
It was all of us.

700
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:24,080
Every single one.
