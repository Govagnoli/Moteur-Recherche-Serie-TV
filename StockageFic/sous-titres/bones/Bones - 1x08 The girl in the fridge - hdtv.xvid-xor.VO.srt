1
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:15,140
So I spent the night at Todd’s. You remember Todd right?
The bass player with the big hands, big nimble hands?

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,767
Angela I’m trying to piece together a skull.

3
00:00:16,818 --> 00:00:27,236
You’re doing a great job. So I wake up this morning and he’s sitting there right?
No clothes on just his bass. Singing to me in this low, low voice, it was creepy.

4
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:30,447
Angela, is this conversation really appropriate here?

5
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:34,451
Sorry but I’m into live people. Anyway Todd has a friend.

6
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,994
I thought you said he was creepy?

7
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,247
Todd, not the friend.

8
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,165
Good news.

9
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,959
I hope this is work related.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,923
The Anthropology Journal is publishing our piece on the evolution of the Coronals suture.

11
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,552
for the interruption.

12
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,393
You’re supposed to bump my fist with yours.

13
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:57,683
Why?

14
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:03,480
I’m told it’s a widely acknowledge gesture of mutual success.

15
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,400
I love it when you two impersonate earthlings.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,612
Okay now, this is weird. There’s some guy in the lounge who asked me to give you this.

17
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:14,116
Is he alive because this is an excellent start to a relationship?

18
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:18,704
I didn’t put a mirror underneath his nose or anything.
He said that you’d know who he was when you opened it.

19
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,756
Okay. A guy who gets her to stop working? This I have to see.

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,596
You left it at my place.

21
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,264
Three years ago.

22
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,560
First time I’ve been to Washington thought that I should return it in person.

23
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,312
Why didn’t you tell me that you were coming?

24
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,899
What if you didn’t take my call? You’re a big important author now.

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,734
You could come down here you know.

26
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:49,610
You could come up.

27
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:52,905
Half-way.

28
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,282
As always.

29
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:00,954
I hope you don’t have any expectations?

30
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:02,623
Do you?

31
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:03,707
Civility.

32
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,000
I can handle that.

33
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:07,836
So, why are you here?

34
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:12,174
George Washington University wants to talk to me about heading their Anthropology department.

35
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,258
They’d be lucky to get you.

36
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,469
I assume they tried you first.

37
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,470
I already had a job.

38
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,263
This is like watching cars mate.

39
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:26,063
It’s got to be Michael Stires, her forensic Anthropology professor from North Western. They were…

40
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,356
Very, very close?

41
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,233
Mm.

42
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:34,196
Dr. Brennan is my Forensic Anthropology professor. Does that mean?

43
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:34,780
No.

44
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,033
It seems like we should have dinner tonight, catch up?

45
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,826
Sounds reasonable.

46
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:50,212
Hey Bones! Whoa. Okay, put it here, easy. Bones! I got a present
for ya straight out of an illegal ravine found in a dump in Fairfax.

47
00:02:50,254 --> 00:03:00,597
You see our forensic people confirmed it was human matter so rather then open it myself and risk
being trashed by you for contaminating the evidence; I decided to bring the whole refrigerator to you.

48
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,141
All we need is a toaster oven.

49
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,935
Bones?

50
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,902
Bodies going to be mostly decomposed.

51
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,488
Which is my cue to leave.

52
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,156
This is where it gets fun.

53
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,658
Alright, you can open it.

54
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,450
Alright.

55
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:28,792
Phew! Okay. Uh, he or she?

56
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:31,712
She.

57
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,463
Eighteen… early twenties.

58
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:39,803
I’m guessing she’s been in the refrigerator for a year. 
Is there enough insect activity to help us be more precise?

59
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:42,389
There’s always enough insect activity.

60
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:49,521
Remove and clean the bone Zach. Michael you can pick me up at 7:30, i will give you my address

61
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,231
Beautiful lab.

62
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,274
Thanks.

63
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:53,817
Old friend?

64
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,027
Old teacher.

65
00:03:55,068 --> 00:04:01,200
Yep, they’re actually going to uh, eat dinner after seeing this? Well it’s not soup.

66
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:06,330
If she was his student and I’m her student, then it follows…

67
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,999
Ain’t gonna happen Zach-O, not in this universe.

68
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,427
Here’s the sketch of the victim. Her skull was intact so it made it easy to work with.

69
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:25,933
I just got her dental records Name…Maggie Schilling…nineteen.

70
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,268
Then I guess you don’t need this.

71
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:35,484
She was a dancer, found markers in her metatarsals.

72
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:47,120
God, they go from the freedom of dance to being crammed into a refrigerator.
I hope she was already dead when they shut the door. He’s hotter then you said.

73
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:49,665
Michael?

74
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:53,043
Any other ex-lovers come knocking on your door today?

75
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:58,674
The ex in ex-lover is not a variable it’s a constant like…the speed of light.

76
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,676
Save your dirty talk for the hunky professor.

77
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:09,434
I can assure you, our relationship is purely plutonic.
What we share is a love of science.
Neither of us has the time or inclination for emotional complications.

78
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,062
Sounds very reasonable.

79
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,773
Yes, now I have to get this data together for Booth.

80
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:19,695
Sure. Have a good dinner tonight.

81
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:35,335
Maggie Schilling went missing eleven months ago. Parents got a ransom note demanding
a million dollars negotiations they dragged on for a couple of weeks then suddenly
all contact stopped. The assumption was that the kidnappers killed her.

82
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,171
No visual physical trauma.

83
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,422
Cause of death?

84
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:46,513
Not yet but there are stress fractures on both wrists and we have some people running
chemical analysis and toxicity screens on the affluent in the refrigerator.

85
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,807
Okay, you call me later?

86
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,019
I’m not working tonight. I have a dinner.

87
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:58,859
What? Wow. I just assumed that the two of you would be eating off an autopsy table.

88
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,819
Not tonight.

89
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:06,283
I was being…tomorrow’s fine. Call me tomorrow.

90
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,130
We missed our reservation.

91
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:25,511
Oh well, that’s the price we pay for deciding to pick exploration and discovery.

92
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:29,431
You realize this is just recreational, Michael?

93
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:35,187
Of course. I’m just impressed that we can just pick up where we left off like no time has passed.

94
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,606
Well, time is an opposed construct.

95
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:40,526
It’s nice to know we can rely on physics.

96
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:44,029
Do you really think you would move here?

97
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,989
Depends on the offer?

98
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:49,243
Maybe I could get you a position at the Jeffersonian?

99
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,203
Working for my old student?

100
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,996
Would that be a problem?

101
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,251
I don’t know we’re better when we’re not vying for dominance in the same arena.

102
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,753
I can’t help it if I’m usually right.

103
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:02,381
Does that mean you have closed the case on that girl in the fridge.

104
00:07:03,851 --> 00:07:08,762
I found some stress fractures on the wrist, not much else but I will.

105
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,472
Same old confident Brennan.

106
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,683
I’m sorry it’s cold

107
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:17,604
Old habits die hard.

108
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:44,131
She did fight, Michael. They kept her tied up like an animal but she fought.
That’s how she got those stress fractures because she was bound and struggling.
I just uh, I keep seeing her face. You know how it is.

109
00:07:50,804 --> 00:08:00,814
BONES
1x08 - THE GIRL IN THE FRIDGE
Original Airdate (FOX): 29/NOV/2005

110
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:10,824
CREATED BY HART HANSON
DIRECTED BY DAVID JONES
TRANSCRIBED BY VERONICA FOR "TWIZ TV.COM"

111
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:22,294
SYNCHRONIZED AND SUBTITLED BY vignemail1

112
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,675
Using a refrigerator to hide a body…Pfft…kinda perfect isn’t it?

113
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,930
A good way to remove the victim without being detected. The rubber gasket sealed in the odor.

114
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:38,060
Maybe the company should use that in their ads? She’s late, she’s never late.

115
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,019
You worried about her?

116
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,479
I’m happy for her.

117
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,313
Why?

118
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,315
Remember that time you were late?

119
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,526
Oh…yeah.

120
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,902
Good morning all.

121
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,908
You know you can take the day off. You deserve one day.

122
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,410
Well Michael wanted to look at our equipment.

123
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,872
I’m gonna let that one go. The guys wanted to meet him anyway.

124
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,666
They could learn a lot from him.

125
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,501
You were Brennan’s professor?

126
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:05,087
She was twenty-three, an adult.

127
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,964
That’s what Clinton said.

128
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,799
Do you run through a lot of students?

129
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:13,595
That was a long time ago and Tempe was very advanced, more colleague then student.

130
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,848
I’m a pretty advanced student.

131
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,268
No offense but uh, I’m not interested.

132
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,687
No, uh, I meant me and her.

133
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,146
Ho, ho burn.

134
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:26,483
What have you found?

135
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:34,283
X-rays reveal low bone density and the parathyroid hormone levels are also low.
There’s a medical condition called hyperparathyroidism.

136
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,785
Symptoms include, muscle weakness, brittle bones, yeah I know.

137
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,537
You may be premature with your struggle theory.

138
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,038
I doubt that.

139
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,748
You mean you don’t want to be doubted.

140
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,542
I can take it.

141
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:46,086
The wrists fractures could have resulted from her medical condition.

142
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,880
Unlikely, however…

143
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,924
Or been an unrelated cause of non-traumatic fissures.

144
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Non-traumatic? Look at these.

145
00:09:52,960 --> 00:10:00,013
Well, it’s something to consider.
The last thing you want to do is jump to conclusions without evidence.I mean I know how much you want to find who did this.

146
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:09,107
This seems like an appropriate moment to discuss human goop. 
Chemical analysis of the liver and kidney tissues reveal 
significance evidence of the narcotic hydromorphone.

147
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,068
Hydromorphone?

148
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,737
Also known as hospital heroine.

149
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,488
In what kind of concentration?

150
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,450
Given her probable size and weight, it’s fatal.

151
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,202
Where’d you go to dinner last night?

152
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:24,041
We wound up staying in. We need to know if that amount was
accrued over time or was delivered in one large dose.

153
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,585
You didn’t come back to the lab did you?

154
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:27,920
I made a frittata.

155
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,089
Oh wow. He cooks too. Can we share him?

156
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:35,010
We also need to know if the hydromorphone was 
administered intravenously or orally.

157
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:39,890
I should get going. I meeting with the board at the University,
call you after my appointment. It was nice meeting you all.

158
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,606
What? Is it so odd for everyone to see me with a man?

159
00:10:50,484 --> 00:11:00,702
Print out the levels of hydromorphone you found in her system.
I want you to find the overload point that would cause the fractures in her 
wrist and examine the left ilium there seems to be some 
kind of degeneration on the edge.

160
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:13,632
I know this sounds terrible but I hoped that she had just run
away that way I could believe she was still alive.

161
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:23,809
She started turning against us in high school, did a lot of drugs.
We tried to help her, sent her to rehab, therapy.

162
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,894
You know kids have a lot to contend with these days.

163
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:35,696
We didn’t help her, not really. We had nannies to raise her because we were so 
busy and we sent her to shrinks when she had problems instead of talking to her.

164
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,197
Look you can’t blame yourself.

165
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,908
But environment plays a huge role in development.

166
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:51,795
I’d like some pictures of Maggie so I can compare them to her remains.
Pictures of her dancing would be most helpful or swimming.

167
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,797
How do you know she danced and swam?

168
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,799
Some things can’t be erased from the body.

169
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:01,972
I’m sorry but I need to ask you about your daughter’s drug problems.
Do you know what she was using?

170
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:05,184
Alcohol, ecstasy, marijuana…

171
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:09,688
What about the narcotic hydromorphone, hospital heroine?

172
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,773
Doesn’t sound familiar.

173
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:15,235
She had a thyroid condition, was anything prescribed for that?

174
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,197
Her endocrinologist might know.

175
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:27,039
We have to find who did this to Maggie. We have to do this for her.

176
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,129
Maggie’s condition didn’t respond to medication. I was trying to get
her to agree to surgery when she disappeared.

177
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,256
What types of medication are we talking about?

178
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,385
Furosemide, alendronate tried various calcitonins.

179
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,637
What about hydromorphone?

180
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:51,939
There are no pain issues associated with hyperthyroidism but
I knew Maggie had a drug problem.
She was definitely interested in getting some Opiates from me.
She bribed my office manager for samples.

181
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,191
I’m going to need your office managers’ home address.

182
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:58,654
Ex-office manager, she’s going to be what you call a disgruntled employee.

183
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:08,205
I didn’t give Maggie Schilling those samples, she boosted them herself.
Barragan just blamed me so he would have an excuse to fire me.

184
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,289
Why’d he fire you?

185
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:15,254
Because he’s a horn dog. I tried to keep things professional you know what I mean.

186
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,632
Dr. Barragan said that you were closer to Maggie Schilling then any other patient.

187
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:20,092
Did you meet her parents?

188
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:20,843
Yes.

189
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:24,179
Then you know the poor girl was pretty much on her own and we took her in.

190
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:27,015
He said that you went out together that you took her to clubs.

191
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:33,438
We just felt sorry for her, you know.
She was lonely so we showed her a good time, right?

192
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,456
pills, vodka, weed

193
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,459
We wanted Maggie to go to meetings, you know. AA

194
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:59,298
That’s very kind of you. Let’s talk about your new refrigerator.

195
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:01,550
Why?

196
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,137
Mainly, I would like to know what happened to your old one, huh?

197
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:17,482
Well the fridge we found Maggie in is a match with the marks on the Costello’s floor.

198
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,526
They’re sadomasochist fetishists.

199
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:22,821
Yeah. They turned the basement into a fun room.

200
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:30,746
Seeking sexual gratification through the manipulation of power.
Probably the oldest of fetishes, master-slave. It’s all about dominance.

201
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:34,750
Well this sort of thing only comes up when the bloom goes off the rose,
if you know what I mean.

202
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,001
I don’t know what you mean.

203
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:41,632
You know when the regular stuff, when it gets old
you need to spice it up or it’s over.
The sex is good you don’t need any help.

204
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:42,716
Well that’s for sure.

205
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:43,383
I’m sorry?

206
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:44,301
I was agreeing.

207
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:46,762
Yeah, well don’t. Okay. It kind of freaks me out.

208
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:51,308
I was just saying that I, myself, feel no inclination towards
either pain or dominance when it comes to sex.

209
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,017
Are you sure?

210
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:52,643
Yeah I’m sure.

211
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:54,937
Because you can be very bossy.

212
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:03,737
Look at him huh? Woo. Look at him all smiley I bet he just loves these things.

213
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:11,537
These could explain the stress fractures.
Her bones were brittle from the disease,
struggling would cause the cracks we saw.

214
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,920
The handcuffs are consistent with the injuries to Maggie Schillings wrists.

215
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,548
Maybe she wanted to be cuffed. Did you ever think about that?

216
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:33,600
Here’s what I was thinking, female, dominant, strapped for cash meets
wealthy teenager on the outs with her parents,
convinces her submissive husband to hold her for ransom.

217
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,394
Any proof or is this story time?

218
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:46,905
You feed her pills to keep her quiet and negotiations, they drag on so she dies of
an overdose before an exchange could be made.
You seal her up in a refrigerator and dump her in a ravine,
and you and your honey go back to playing tie me up in the basemen

219
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:57,916
Maggie Schilling was legally an adult. 
We don’t deny she was in the house, even cuffed. 
We don’t deny there was a perfectly legal sexual relationship which 
by its nature got rough but Maggie was a willing participant.

220
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,626
And enthusiastic.

221
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,920
You have no evidence my client’s killed her.

222
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:07,009
It’s weird for you, huh? Being the one that’s all locked up.

223
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:12,389
Why don’t you come at me? Are you threatened or do I turn you on?

224
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,560
Now I’m the one who’s hating Psychology.

225
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,314
If you don’t have anything but those cuffs, my clients will be out of here in 24 hours.

226
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,488
I figured it out. I was right about how she got those fractures.

227
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,866
I just don’t have the time Tempe, I have an appointment.

228
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:33,994
Well, I thought you would want to see. The University can wait a few minutes.

229
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:39,791
It’s not with them it’s with someone they want me to meet and 
if we start debating evidence, I will definitely be late.

230
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:49,259
Trust me, there’s nothing to debate.
I can prove that Maggie Schilling was bound in fur covered handcuffs.
We found strands of matching fur embedded in her wrists in the scaphoid lunate.

231
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,595
But you can’t prove she was involuntarily restrained.

232
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:52,888
Oh yes I can.

233
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,306
It’s not a competition.

234
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:58,143
No, the Olympics are a competition. Ours is a struggle to the death.

235
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,561
You want to bet dinner?

236
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:04,149
Yes, if we make it to a restaurant.

237
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:06,985
That’s on. You got ten minutes.

238
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:07,903
Okay.

239
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:11,573
Pull up frontal and lateral view of the victims’ lower fibulas.

240
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:14,076
You trained her well, Doc.

241
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,246
She’s brilliant, a little cocky though.

242
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:20,666
Ha. Yeah, tell me about it.

243
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,668
Here’s the leg.

244
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:31,301
She’s been a good partner though. What you see is what you get,
it’s a rare quality. That’s just between us.

245
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:32,594
Michael.

246
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:37,599
Dr. Brennan found marks on the medial malleoli, both left and right.

247
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,892
Her legs were bound.

248
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:42,104
There are erosion patterns from the bones rubbing together over time.

249
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:52,948
If this were a result of sex games then the legs they wouldn’t be bound together.
Ah, come on, ya know. Looking for a little nooky the last thing you tie together are the legs.

250
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:59,872
I’m not convinced. Brittle bones from her thyroid condition,
the damage could of happened in a very short time.

251
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:04,042
We also found evidence of inflammation on her right humerus and ilium.

252
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:07,963
The bone abnormalities indicate pathosis from lying in one position for a long time.

253
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:10,799
The only reasonable explanation is long term bondage.

254
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:17,347
Decreased bone density could have caused the inflammation. This isn’t definitive.
I hear there’s a nice little French place near here I’d like to try.

255
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:19,516
I still have five minutes.

256
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:27,149
My department is still working with Polaroid’s.

257
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,234
So, what do you think?

258
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:33,530
Very impressive, especially to the non-professional.

259
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:37,075
You want science? Give me the estimated time of captivity.

260
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,494
Approximately three weeks.

261
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:46,877
Okay, here are your affected areas, now doing an advanced time simulation.

262
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:54,927
You’re winning, right?

263
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,096
Can I see your findings?

264
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,397
This appears to be indisputable.

265
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:11,318
The narcotic found in her system was not the result of recreational drug abuse.

266
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:14,947
The inflammation would have been very painful and
the pain would have increased over time.

267
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:21,245
They kept upping the dose of hydromorphone until
they gave her too much and she died.
Those people bound and killed that girl.

268
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:24,498
I yield. French restaurant?

269
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:32,089
I’m more in the mood for Italian.
I need to put together the evidence package for
Booth to deliver to the U.S. attorney.

270
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,340
I’ll meet you at your place.

271
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:37,135
Good work.

272
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:41,390
Do you really think he can handle your success?

273
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,643
What because of today? We’ve always been competitive.

274
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:50,232
I know but he’s a man and his student, a woman, has surpassed him.

275
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:52,568
Michael is extremely secure, Ang.

276
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,696
Honey, when you stuck it to him today, he was upset.

277
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:59,825
It was a healthy debate between scientists. You don’t know Michael.

278
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:03,370
I know men and I know what happens when two people start sleeping together.

279
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,998
It’s not like that. We’re friends, colleagues, that’s all.

280
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,291
Colleagues with benefits.

281
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:17,050
I don’t know what that means but Michael and I are not involved.
I’m sorry if that’s difficult for you to understand but
what we have isn’t traditional.

282
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:29,313
Don’t talk to me about traditional, okay, I’ve dated circus people.
You and Michael you have something and that’s okay,
that’s good even. Just be honest about it.

283
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:35,444
Bones. The judge is um, holding them without bail.
The US attorney is thinking about sending you flowers.

284
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,362
Facts are facts.

285
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:43,619
Ah, Bones I have to ask how much have you been sharing with uh, the professor?

286
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,078
None of your business.

287
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,371
I mean on the case.

288
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:49,249
Oh, I bounce everything off of him. Why?

289
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,792
You got to keep him out of it from now on.

290
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:51,668
Out of it. Why?

291
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,004
Well, you know that appointment that he had today?

292
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:54,880
Yeah.

293
00:20:54,922 --> 00:21:05,015
He met with the Costello’s lawyer.
Michael is their expert witness.
It’s his job to tear apart the case that you’ve built.

294
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:11,438
How could I not be upset?
Basically you were spying on me.

295
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:18,570
Spying? It’s a criminal proceeding.
You are required by law to disclose all your
findings to the defense anyway.

296
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:25,035
I’m only required to provide you with the raw facts
we intend to enter into evidence not the process
by which I arrived at those facts.

297
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:29,289
I apologize that’s a nuance, it escaped me.

298
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:32,209
Why don’t you just tell me Michael?

299
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:44,721
Cause the defense isn’t required to tell the prosecution anything.
In fact it’s grounds for a mistrial.
Look, I’ve never done this before.
You’re the teacher in this situation, I’m the student.

300
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:46,640
A little competitive.

301
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:59,444
Part of the job at the University is to be an expert witness and
yes I would like to do that job at least as well as you but
if you feel I’ve overstepped some boundary here,
I’ll back out of the case.

302
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:04,992
No, but if you stay on you have to move back to the hotel.

303
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:07,119
Really?

304
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:07,870
Yes.

305
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,918
Hm, well would I have to do it tonight or should I order another bottle of wine?

306
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:18,922
I suppose tomorrow would be soon enough.

307
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,925
I apologize, Tempe.

308
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:35,606
He’s still at it?

309
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:38,567
Yep and it is fascinating.

310
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,235
Why don’t you keep an eye on him?

311
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:41,570
That’s not going to be a problem.

312
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,545
Did you just give Zach and Hodgins a sign of encouragement?

313
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:04,134
Well, you know, that’s the first time I have been able to look
at them without imagining Moe knocking their heads together.

314
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:06,970
Agent Booth you’re accessing your inner squint.

315
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:12,226
Tempe you listed an avulsion fracture on
the right femur, looks minor.
Do you consider this evidence?

316
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:16,438
Dr. Brennan’s conclusions belong to the prosecution.

317
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,442
I have no interest in destroying your case, Agent Booth.
I’m just trying to get a sense…

318
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:23,862
Of her interpretations of data to which you are not privy, Dr. Stires.

319
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:31,912
I understand the game the Doctor is trying to play
and I’m perfectly capable of dealing with him myself.
I’m sure he’s just thrown by findings he would have missed.

320
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:37,835
This is not about you and Dr. Stires.
This is about the Jeffersonian’s reputation as
a source of expert witnesses.

321
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:49,263
Okay, I’m…I’m on my own.
Oh, in the interest of fairness,
I am willing to share my thoughts with you.
I red penciled a few things.

322
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:52,140
You corrected my findings?

323
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:54,643
Consider it an opposing opinion.

324
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:57,855
My findings are based on facts Michael not opinions.

325
00:23:57,855 --> 00:24:03,277
You seem to have finished your allotted time
with the remains, Dr. Stires. I’d like my
people to get back to work.

326
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:04,570
Thank you.

327
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:11,076
Bones you okay?

328
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:12,202
Why wouldn’t I be?

329
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:17,416
Oh cause the nutty professor has graded your paper.
What’d he give you anyway?
I was always happy with a B.

330
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,334
I never got a B and I never will.

331
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:22,880
That’s my girl.

332
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:28,802
Assistant Attorney, Andrew Levitt, uh, jury consultant Joey Deaver, Dr. Temperance Brennan.

333
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:33,265
Nice to meet you. I’ve looked over your findings and I think we are in good shape.

334
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:34,349
Thank You…I would…

335
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:35,184
Juries don’t like you.

336
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:36,810
Excuse me?

337
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:41,148
I’ve seen you testify before Dr. Brennan.
You come off cold and aloof. I want to make sure…

338
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:42,149
Cold and aloof?

339
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:47,112
Try not interrupting, it makes you sound arrogant.
Also don’t front load your testimony with technical crap.

340
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:49,323
Look, this really is not the best approached.

341
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:52,451
I’m a technical witness. I have testified in over thirty trials.

342
00:24:52,493 --> 00:24:58,373
But most of the experts you’ve come up against are as
dry and boring as you are.
Now I don’t know if you’ve seen their expert…

343
00:24:58,415 --> 00:24:59,958
She’s seen him, Ms. Deaver.

344
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:10,469
Well then you understand my concern.
Professor Stires is open, charming, great looking.
The jury’s going to love him. I love him.

345
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:14,681
This isn’t a personality contest. It’s about data that we present to the jury.

346
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:22,773
You’re kidding, right? The women on the jury aren’t going
to be listening to a word that comes out of his mouth.

347
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:26,777
They’re going to be undressing him... I don’t want
the men on the jury to be putting more clothes on

348
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:30,822
you. Wear something blue it suggests truth, make eye
contact with the jury, and loose the clunky necklace.

349
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:36,870
Mary and Scott Costello murdered Maggie Schilling.
The forensic data I’ve complied proves that.
That should be enough.

350
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:37,621
But it isn’t enough.

351
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:41,875
Okay that’s…that’s great. We’ll uh,
take that under consideration, thanks.

352
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:49,508
Why didn’t she say anything about you?
You can be very irritating sometimes.

353
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:56,682
Bones, she’s an expert just like you.
She has an obvious personality disorder
but she wants to help. Just try.

354
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:58,392
Okay, sure.

355
00:25:58,392 --> 00:26:00,102
Good.

356
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:02,020
I can do it.

357
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:29,214
We will show that Mary Costello lured Maggie Schilling into her home with the promise of drugs.

358
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:37,848
She was not held against her will.
She was in fact orchestrating the plot to extort money
from her own parents from whom she was estranged.

359
00:26:37,848 --> 00:26:44,188
They bound her for weeks, the pain growing,
and to keep her quiet they pumped her full of drugs.

360
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:47,608
Her death was the result of a self-administered overdose.

361
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:55,866
After killing their captive and ruining their chances of collecting the ransom,
the Costello’s stuffed Miss. Schilling’s body into the refrigerator.

362
00:26:55,908 --> 00:27:05,209
Knowing they could be accused of kidnapping and murder,
my clients panicked and disposed of her body while their behavior
might be ill advised they are neither kidnappers nor murderers.

363
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:28,106
The pharmaceutical samples of hydromorphone were found in the Costello’s belongings.
The lot numbers matched those that were in Dr. Barragan’s office.
When I went to the Costello’s kitchen I saw the marks from the old refrigerator on the floor.
It was lik

364
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:28,815
Objection.

365
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:31,109
Sustained, just the facts Agent Booth.

366
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:42,204
Sorry, it was just that the receipt for the new refrigerator was dated two
days after the negotiations broke off with the kidnappers.
I mean you figure it out. I know, I’m sorry.

367
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:48,460
Any evidence Maggie Schilling wasn’t a willing participant in
sexual activity involving those cuffs and other paraphernalia?

368
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:53,423
Well winding up in the fridge kind of tells me that she really wasn’t that into it.

369
00:27:54,383 --> 00:27:54,925
Your honor?

370
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:56,093
No direct evidence.

371
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:59,471
Any evidence my clients forced Miss. Schilling to take that narcotic.

372
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:01,932
I’ll leave those answers for the experts.

373
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:13,569
Scarids ah, also known as dark-winged fungus gnats went through several life cycles
also present were acatadye and notadye but the most interesting find wa

374
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:23,453
not a bug at all but was common bread mold. All this data led to the same conclusion,
Maggie Schilling was in that refrigerator between ten and twelve months.

375
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:33,172
Even though we already had medical
records and dental records from which
to identify Maggie Schilling, I was
also asked to do a sketch based on the
architecture of her skull. That’s sort

376
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:55,068
of what I do. It turned out pretty
accurate if I do say so myself. She was
a pretty girl, that’s why I drew her
smiling. It… it just seemed right. I’m
really sorry for what happened to her
but I hope my work helps you.

377
00:28:55,110 --> 00:29:01,116
The gelatinous puddle was decomposed
tissue from which our lab extracted and
analyzed liver and kidney samples by

378
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:12,920
mass spectrometer. The hydromorphone
level in her liver was 8.4 and 6.6 in
her kidney. Death occurs at 7.7 and 5.2
respectively.

379
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:15,380
And the reason they would be giving the victim this narcotic?

380
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:22,804
Short-term periosteal reaction on the right proximal lateral
humerus was consistent with a bound individual.

381
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:23,931
So to rephrase…

382
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:26,975
And the placement of wrist restraints
coupled with her hyperparathyroidism

383
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:33,690
would account for the stress fractures
on the distal anterior surface of both
the radi and ulni.

384
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:36,860
Her bones broke because she was struggling to free herself?

385
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:41,114
Yeah, I believe I just said that.

386
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:48,372
Thank you, doctor. That will be all
for now. I would like to move for a

387
00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:51,750
recess with the right to recall the
witness, your honor?

388
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:55,337
Okay, we’ll meet back here in thirty minutes.

389
00:29:57,339 --> 00:29:59,424
She can’t connect. Those killers are going to walk.

390
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:03,470
It was well reasoned.

391
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,681
Yeah it was, um, very scientific.

392
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:09,142
You didn’t listen to a thing I said.
You were like Klaatu the robot up

393
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:12,563
there. Would it have killed you to
speak English?

394
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:14,982
I wore blue. I looked at the jury.

395
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:17,568
You know for a people person, you’re a little rude.

396
00:30:17,568 --> 00:30:20,195
Well at what point did the facts stop working for you?

397
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:23,490
I have no problem with the facts as long as the jury can understand them.

398
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:25,742
Well, you’re underestimating their intelligence.

399
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:31,373
You’re overestimating their ability to stay awake.
When these S&M perverts walk on this, it’ll be on your head.

400
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:35,127
Can you believe that!?

401
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:38,422
What? You agree with her?

402
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:40,465
Uh, not entirely.

403
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:45,387
Not entirely, so that means partly. Well I was perfectly clear.
Didn’t you think I was clear?

404
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:54,479
Sometimes and um, sometimes you were… a little hard to follow.

405
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:55,564
What are you talking about? When?

406
00:30:55,564 --> 00:31:02,279
When you were…talking.
Listen Bones, I know you care about this case
but I think you should let them see that.

407
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:03,322
So I should perform.

408
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:07,951
Just a little bit. Yeah I mean. Do you see how
I portrayed myself as a no nonsense, tough guy, cop?

409
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:09,161
you are a tough guy, cop.

410
00:31:09,495 --> 00:31:13,624
Exactly and I think that it wouldn’t hurt if the jury saw who you really are.

411
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:18,378
Well I don’t know who you think that is Booth because
this is who I really am… Just this.

412
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:23,050
God, sorry.

413
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:25,719
I’m okay, are you?

414
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:32,809
Sure. Well truthfully this whole thing is pretty awkward. Don’t you think?

415
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:35,395
We’re just doing our job. We’ll be fine.

416
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:41,944
It’s just they have this jury consultant.
They want to turn this into a melodrama.
They don’t understand what a scientist is.

417
00:31:41,944 --> 00:31:44,154
Tempe, we’re not allowed to talk about the case.

418
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:45,405
I know. I’m just saying…

419
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:47,449
My guy is going to freak if he sees us talking.

420
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:49,076
Sure, sorry.

421
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:57,543
In my opinion the high levels of hydromorphone are
more consistent with recreational use then for pain relief.

422
00:31:57,543 --> 00:31:58,544
Could you explain?

423
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:05,467
Well I might not use all the technical language but I’ll try to make myself understood.

424
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:10,013
Objection your honor.
The witness is impuning another witness.

425
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:12,140
Sustained, continue.

426
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:21,525
I’m sorry. I uh, I don’t do this
professionally. People who need to
relieve physical pain will stop after
the pain disappears. It doesn’t take
more then an average dose to accomplish

427
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:32,911
that. Drug users are trying to bury
emotional pain which means they’ll
medicate until they feel nothing. This
is why they have a tendency to overdose
like Maggie Schilling.

428
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:37,166
That’s not accurate sometimes chronic pain does not respond to medication.

429
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:38,709
I’ll bring it up on cross examination.

430
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:43,130
What about Dr. Brennan’s claim that her pain was somehow
connected to the victim being bound for a length of time?

431
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:51,138
Well, the Costello’s have already
stipulated to the fact that they bound
Miss. Schilling as a part of their
rather unorthodox sexual act and Dr.

432
00:32:51,180 --> 00:33:03,275
Brennan agrees that Miss. Schilling had
hyperpara…well if I could simplify, a
thyroid condition that can weaken her
bones. No need to look for bondage
scenarios.

433
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:05,277
That is ridiculous. He’s ignoring all the facts.

434
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:13,243
With respect to my former student, Dr.
Brennan. With findings like these I
don’t know why she became a Forensic

435
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:16,955
Anthropologist. She seems to have
ignored all but her pre-conceived
notions about the case.

436
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:18,749
Objection.

437
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:20,000
Sustained.

438
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:21,168
I apologize.

439
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:23,212
Do you disagree with Dr. Brennan’s data?

440
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:34,097
Well, sometimes doctors can use data
to confuse a very simple situation. I
mean I’m a doctor and I could hardly
follow her. This case is about people,

441
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:43,106
not incomprehensible technical jargon.
I don’t think that these people should
be convicted of murder just because Dr.
Brennan sounds smart.

442
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:44,149
Your honor, really.

443
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:50,614
The jury will disregard Professor Stires’ personal view of Dr. Brennan.
The court will adjourn until 9am tomorrow.

444
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:54,326
Listen, don’t worry about a thing, okay?

445
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:58,497
He wasn’t acting as an objective expert. He was making up a story.

446
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:01,124
The judge chastised him in front of the jury that will work for us.

447
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:09,174
The hell it will. The jury loves Stires.
He looks like a regular guy who’s not allowed to speak
the truth because the stupid rules get in the way.

448
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:11,468
The rules of jurist prudence aren’t stupid.

449
00:34:11,468 --> 00:34:18,100
Dr. Brennan you need to learn the difference between
reality and perception. A trial is all about perception.

450
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,228
Wow, you’re the reason civilization is declining.

451
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,689
Talk to her.

452
00:34:23,689 --> 00:34:24,606
I kind of agree with her.

453
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:29,945
Thanks.

454
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:32,447
You know I really don’t agree with you. I just…I don’t like her.

455
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:36,618
Put me back on the stand I can rebut everything that Michael said.

456
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,327
She can do this.

457
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:39,496
I’ll think about it.

458
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:45,127
I’ve never been in this position before Booth.
I need to get back up there.

459
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:47,212
Alright, just let me talk to him.

460
00:34:53,927 --> 00:35:00,642
Trial going badly? You don’t usually cram at the last minute.

461
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:11,945
The jury likes Michael better then they like me,
apparently that’s a problem. Are they stupid?

462
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:18,785
Compared to you, yes they are stupid.
However, compared to you most of the
world is a little stupid.

463
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:29,630
You have many skills Temperance. Not one of them
includes communicating with the average
person on the street which is exactly
what juries are made of.

464
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:33,467
I’m a better Forensic Anthropologist then Michael Stires.

465
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:36,553
Which is why two years ago I hired you instead of him.

466
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:37,888
Michael applied for this job?

467
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:38,514
Yes.

468
00:35:38,555 --> 00:35:40,599
His credentials are better then mine.

469
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:48,774
Yes but you are the more rational
reasoned empirical scientist and you

470
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:54,488
care and if he tries to convince you
otherwise, tell him to go to hell.

471
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,875
Is it safe to approach, Dr. Brennan?

472
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,043
Don’t charm Michael.

473
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:10,045
I think you’re taking this too personally.

474
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:11,547
You think I should be more rational?

475
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:12,256
Yes.

476
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:13,048
Go to hell.

477
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,759
Look, you’re not the only one with a
jury consultant. The difference is that

478
00:36:15,801 --> 00:36:19,137
I listened to mine. He told me to
create reasonable doubt, that’s what I did.

479
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:22,891
This one isn’t about winning a pasta
dinner or showing up your former student.

480
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:27,062
It’s about putting two people
away who murdered a nineteen year old girl.

481
00:36:27,104 --> 00:36:29,064
Tempe, you can’t personalize the work.

482
00:36:29,064 --> 00:36:33,861
Do you remember in Central America
standing in a mass grave being guarded
by soldiers? We knew that they were

483
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:42,828
probably the same soldiers who had
killed the people we were digging up. I
was just a student. I was scared. I
turned to you and asked ‘what do we do?’

484
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:46,123
That was a different place and a radically different context.

485
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:52,296
You said we tell the truth. We do not flinch. You flinched, Michael.

486
00:36:57,676 --> 00:37:01,013
I can’t ask her that. That whole line of questioning isn’t relevant.

487
00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:04,308
He brought it up during his testimony so legally you can reintroduce it.

488
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:05,851
How is that going to change anything?

489
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:07,644
Trust me, it will.

490
00:37:09,855 --> 00:37:10,731
Am I testifying?

491
00:37:13,525 --> 00:37:17,029
Only a prolonged struggle not sexual
activity would cause the tearing on the

492
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:21,200
medial head of the gastric nemius
muscle on the distal portion of the
bone and…

493
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:22,576
So in lay terms?

494
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:23,744
The muscle avulsed.

495
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:24,745
She pulled a muscle?

496
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:26,497
Because she was immobilized.

497
00:37:26,497 --> 00:37:27,372
Tied up?

498
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:38,091
Yes, these conditions have to be contextualized. The inflammation on the ileum...

499
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:42,679
Dr. Brennan, why’d you become a Forensic Anthropologist?

500
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:43,931
I beg your pardon?

501
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:46,934
There must be some reason you chose
this field out of the hundred of other

502
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:52,731
careers someone of your intelligence
could have chosen. Was there some
emotional reason, perhaps?

503
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:54,233
Objection. Relevance, you honor?

504
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:56,360
I don’t see how this pertains to the case.

505
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:59,154
Dr. Brennan is cold distant and alienating your honor.

506
00:37:59,196 --> 00:37:59,863
Hey!

507
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:04,284
I need the jury to understand why she’s so cold so that they might
be willing to accept her testimony.

508
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:06,620
Her personality issues are not relevant to this case.

509
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:10,624
They opened up this line of
questioning, your honor. When Dr.
Stires was on the stand, he wondered

510
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:15,838
why Dr. Brennan became a Forensic
Anthropologist so the defense must have
thought it had some relevance then.

511
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:22,553
Sorry, Mr. Meredith you did raise the issue.
Over ruled. You may continue Mr. Levitt.

512
00:38:22,594 --> 00:38:30,060
Dr. Brennan, your parents disappeared when you
were fifteen and no one’s ever found out
whatever happened to them. Is that correct?

513
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:36,859
Please answer the question, Dr. Brennan.

514
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:43,323
That’s correct.

515
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:51,248
It must be very painful. Is it fair to say that
you’ve been trying to solve the mystery
of their loss your whole life?

516
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:55,669
Do I want answers? Yes. As how that is
affecting my behavior which I assume is

517
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:59,089
what you are trolling for? I don’t put
much stock in Psychology.

518
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:02,593
Is that why you wrap yourself up in
techno-speak so you don’t have to feel

519
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:04,511
how these victims’s remind you of your
parents.

520
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:07,222
How I feel doesn’t matter. My job doesn’t depend on it.

521
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:12,477
But it’s informed by it. Are you as cold and unfeeling as you seem?

522
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:32,873
I see a face on every skull. I can
look at their bones and tell you how
they walked, where they hurt. Maggie

523
00:39:32,915 --> 00:39:41,590
Schilling is real to me. The pain she
suffered was real. Her hip was being
eaten away by infection from lying on

524
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:48,764
her side. Sure like Dr. Stires said
the disease could contribute to that if
you take it out of context but you

525
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:57,523
can’t break Maggie Schilling down into
little pieces. She was a whole
person who fought to free herself. Her

526
00:39:57,564 --> 00:40:03,654
wrists were broken from struggling
against the handcuffs. The bones in
her ankles were ground together because

527
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:11,578
her feet were tied and her side, her
hip, and her shoulder were being eaten
away by infection and the more she
struggled, the more pain she was in so

528
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:18,460
they gave her those drugs to keep her
quiet. They gave her so much it killed
her. These facts can’t be

529
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:31,640
ignored or dismissed because you think
I’m …uh, boring or obnoxious because I
don’t matter. What I feel doesn’t
matter. Only she matters, only Maggie.

530
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:42,401
Tempe! Tempe! Tempe, I’m sorry. What can I do?

531
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:51,076
Bones, the Costello’s are trying to
cop to a plea to a charge that won’t

532
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:53,078
mean the death penalty. They know
they’re going down.

533
00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:56,415
You had no right. There are things that are private.

534
00:40:56,415 --> 00:41:04,131
Yeah, maybe you’re right but you know what this was my case too. Alright, so nothing personal?

535
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:19,229
Guilty on all counts.

536
00:41:21,398 --> 00:41:21,690
Yeah.

537
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:24,943
So he owes you another dinner, huh?

538
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:27,738
No, I won’t be seeing him anymore.

539
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:30,407
Sorry.

540
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:38,540
I was foolish to be so open with him. It was irrational.
You know how you get when you’re tired?

541
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:43,420
Yeah. You want to go out? Grab a drink?

542
00:41:44,046 --> 00:41:47,132
Um, I think I just want to work.

543
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:49,927
Okay.

544
00:41:55,224 --> 00:41:55,599
Hey Bones.

545
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,101
What is it? I’m not feeling very forgiving.

546
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:01,271
Yeah I know but uh, we have a case.

547
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:25,003
The victim is an adult male, thirty-five
to forty years old. From the

548
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:28,966
pattern of the burning, I would say an
accelerant was used. Could you hand me
my bag?

549
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:32,970
Yeah sure, hey listen you want my coat or something? It’s cold up here.

550
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:34,930
If I did, I would ask for it.

551
00:42:34,972 --> 00:42:41,311
Yeah, sorry and um, I’m sorry.

552
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:46,900
You had something to accomplish and
you found a logical way of getting what you needed.

553
00:42:52,406 --> 00:42:53,907
I probably would have done
the same thing.
