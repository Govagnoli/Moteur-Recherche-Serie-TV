Holy Mother of God!
Mmm! Geez!

00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,722
[Brennan]
Booth, what do we have here?

7
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,733
[Hodgins]
Bet I know.

8
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,598
That's... [Sniffing]
lasagna...

9
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:40,161
fishy rotten cat food,
and vulcanized rubber.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,265
Excellent olfactory talent, Hodgins.

11
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,833
- What happened?
- Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

12
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,004
<i>Guy tried to beat the light.</i>
<i>He got T-boned.</i>

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,015
- What was the semi carrying?
- Aquarium sand. But that's not...

14
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,779
No natural gas or propane?
No explosion? No fire?

15
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:56,652
- No corrosive chemicals.
- What do you need me for?

00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,850
<i>[Saroyan]</i>
<i>You might want to prepare yourself.</i>

- Or not.
- <i>[Booth] Oh, man.</i>

18
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:07,826
Okay, how bad does, uh, garbage gotta stink
to cover the smell of a dead body?

19
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,664
I think the victim was a minor.

20
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,172
Okay. Well, then if you agree,
then this falls under F.B.I. jurisdiction.

21
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,708
It's a male.

22
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:22,475
Yes. An adolescent.

23
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,643
Flatworms, necrophagous flies
and beetles.

24
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,948
<i>Yeah, he's been garbage</i>
<i>for about three weeks.</i>

25
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,148
I didn't mean that
the way it sounded.

26
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:37,929
Fractures to the cranium, sphenoid,
and occipital regions.

27
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:41,023
Neck's broken.
And the femur is shattered.

28
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,069
From the garbage truck
flipping over?

29
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:46,731
No. This damage is
more congruent with a fall.

30
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:54,445
- What do you got?
- It's organic.

31
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:59,281
Whatever it is, he brought it with him
from the crime scene.

32
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:06,148
- How much of this are you gonna need?
- The whole disgusting shebang.

33
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:09,593
- [Groans] Everything?
- Everything.

34
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,596
[Mumbles]

35
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,533
He was wrapped in a shroud?

36
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,592
Angela's analyzing
the stains on the cloth...

37
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,035
while Hodgins figures out
what they're made of.

38
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,869
No finger pads left for prints.
How are we on dental records?

39
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,875
<i>F.B.I. 's on it.</i>

40
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:29,915
Multiple shards of leaded glass
embedded in the remaining tissue.

41
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:35,854
Massive contusions congruent
with a swan dive onto a hard surface.

42
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,856
And take a look at the upper spine.

43
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:41,951
Weighted impact against
the, uh, scapula and clavicle.

44
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:46,192
- He was struck?
- Yes, but not hard enough to kill.

45
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,757
Private garbage hauler.
They aren't real strict about their routes.

46
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,531
Driver says he can't be sure
where he picked the victim up.

47
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:55,540
- No visible tats or track marks.
- You sound surprised.

48
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:58,270
Well, it's pretty obvious, Bones.
It's either a junkie or a hustler.

49
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,073
Why make that assumption?

50
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,808
Not many kids from the suburbs
end up riding in garbage trucks.

51
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,282
- Fun factoid from the front lines.
- <i>[Angela] Hey, guys.</i>

52
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,444
Want to see something cool?

53
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,649
I assume you're all familiar
with the Shroud ofTurin.

54
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:15,592
Image of Christ's face
on the inside a burial cloth.

55
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,596
Right. Booth's a good Catholic boy.

56
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,155
- It was revealed to be a hoax.
- [Booth] It wasn't a hoax.

57
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,167
[Chuckles]
Okay. Whatever you want to believe.

58
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,760
This is no hoax.

59
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,829
On the fabric covering
John Doe's skull...

60
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:32,241
<i>there are tissue stains around</i>
<i>the eye sockets, the nose, and the mouth.</i>

61
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,281
<i>This is essentially</i>
<i>a photo negative ofhis features.</i>

62
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,816
Are you saying you have enough
to assemble a face?

63
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,342
- [Computer Beeping]
- I call it the Shroud of Montenegro.

64
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,446
<i>I used computer tomography...</i>

65
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:47,857
<i>to create X-ray slices</i>
<i>of the underlying facial architecture.</i>

66
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:52,227
<i>Selective laser centering</i>
<i>allowed me to map unimprinted areas.</i>

67
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:56,496
<i>Skin tone and hair color were</i>
<i>extrapolated based on Dr. Saroyan's data.</i>

68
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:01,973
I'm no expert, but he sure doesn't
look like a street kid.

69
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,079
I'm running our facial reconstruction...

70
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,910
through the Center for Missing
and Exploited Person database.

71
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,712
- That's a lot of missing kids.
- <i>[Brennan] These arejust the locals.</i>

72
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,253
- <i>[Booth] Let's hope we don't</i>
<i>have to go national.</i>
- <i>[Saroyan] Narrow the search...</i>

73
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,016
to street kids in the foster system.

74
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,579
Why?

75
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,092
Because statistically,
that's where this boy comes from.

76
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,321
It's far too early
to start narrowing our focus.

77
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,728
Runaways, street kids,
foster system.

78
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,028
Dr. Saroyan's the boss.

79
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,866
I've autopsied a lot of dead kids...
car accidents, drug overdoses, drownings.

80
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:07,098
<i>Fine. It's a broad search.</i>

81
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:11,007
Kid in a Dumpster... it's a runaway,
street kid or foster system.

82
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,011
Cam's right, Bones.

83
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,708
Got it. Dylan Crane, 17.

84
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:20,844
<i>This is why I was appointed this job,</i>
<i>Dr. Brennan... to streamline the process.</i>

85
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,414
- Honor student from a nice
neighborhood in Alexandria.
- Oops.

86
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,756
He disappeared three weeks ago
with his girlfriend, Kelly Morris...

87
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,058
<i>who</i> is <i>in the foster system.</i>

88
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,122
Good.

89
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,862
There we go. I guess your first move
is to find Kelly Morris.

90
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:42,465
No, the first move is to inform the Cranes
that we just found their son.

91
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:46,672
- Are you positive?
- We don't need to <i>identify</i> him?
To make sure, I mean?

92
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,680
I need to see my son.
You understand?

93
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,216
Mr. and Mrs. Crane,
I realize this is very hard.

94
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,117
But the reason why we asked you
to come to theJeffersonian...

95
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,155
I'm a forensic anthropologist.

96
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,383
I don't understand
the significance of that.

97
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:03,987
I'm called in when a victim
is too decomposed to <i>identify.</i>

98
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,724
Oh, God.

99
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:11,065
I was able to <i>identify</i> Dylan
beyond the shadow of a doubt.

100
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,605
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>
- That's Dylan.

101
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,699
- How did he die?
- He fell...

102
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,677
from a height of
approximately 50 feet.

103
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,907
Suicide?

104
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:25,348
Is there any reason to believe
that your son was despondent?

105
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,352
Dylan? No.

106
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,514
He was a smart, happy kid.

107
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,150
Problems at school?

108
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,854
You know, uh, spending too much time
on the Internet? Anything like that?

109
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,795
His whole life centered around
this girl that he was seeing.

110
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,332
Was this Kelly Morris?

111
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,301
Yes. I suppose you read
the missing persons report.

112
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,633
So you know Kelly's
in a foster situation?

113
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,606
Have you seen her
since Dylan disappeared?

114
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:51,871
- No.
- To be honest, we were hoping
they ran away together.

115
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:55,311
- Why would they do that?
- We told Dylan to stop seeing her.

116
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:56,939
Why?

117
00:06:57,016 --> 00:07:00,281
Dylan met her at Harbor Plaza
where the street kids hang out.

118
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,651
Dylan was getting ready
to go to M.I.T.

119
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,485
<i>She's already dropped out</i>
<i>ofhigh school.</i>

120
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,855
The life we provided didn't
prepare him for a girl like Kelly.

121
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,895
- You mean a foster child?
- Bones.

122
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:13,159
Whatever happened to my son,
it happened because of Kelly.

123
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:16,360
<i>We're going to find her,</i>
<i>and we're going to talk to her.</i>

124
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:20,634
Dr. Brennan, I can see that you think
that we're being hard on Kelly.

125
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,766
But my son...

126
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:27,870
My son was a good kid
with his whole life ahead of him.

127
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,216
Kelly Morris's foster mother's
gonna meet us in my office.

128
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,226
Okay.

129
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,957
She says Kelly took off a couple
weeks ago with most of her belongings.

130
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,160
[Sighs]

131
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,725
You okay, Bones?

132
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,794
I was a foster child.

133
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,363
Yeah, I know.

134
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,466
Did people always assume
the worst of <i>me?</i>

135
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,841
[Sighs] You know,
I know that you hate psychology.

136
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:02,608
But those people...
They just lost their son.

137
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,583
They need to blame someone.

138
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,684
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Poor Dylan. He was a good kid.</i>

139
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,626
He was a good influence on Kelly.

140
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:20,063
<i>Trying to get her back into school.</i>
<i>And he was good to Alex.</i>

141
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:23,124
<i>Treated him just like</i>
<i>a little brother.</i>

142
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:26,365
To the best of your knowledge,
were Kelly and Dylan sexually active?

143
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,839
Oh, I know they were.

144
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:32,241
I'm afraid I caught them
in Kelly's bedroom.

145
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,212
And I had to forbid Kelly to bring Dylan
into the house after that.

146
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,273
- Why?
- It's the rules.

147
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,751
They're underage,
and Kelly's a ward of the state.

148
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,847
<i>And I knew that it might force Dylan and</i>
<i>Kelly to find other places to be together.</i>

149
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:48,792
<i>You know, to feed into</i>
<i>their own, uh,</i> Romeo and Juliet <i>fantasy.</i>

150
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:53,230
<i>But Alex lives in the house, too,</i>
<i>and he's only 12.</i>

151
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,791
- Kelly and her brother, are they close?
- Very close.

152
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,667
Their parents were killed
in a hotel fire four years ago.

153
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,401
<i>They had no family.</i>
<i>They were put into the system.</i>

154
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,444
I've had them for
a little over a year.

155
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,002
That's a pretty good run
for a foster kid...

156
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,480
especially a brother and a sister
who want to be together.

157
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,575
Yes.

158
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:14,984
What?

159
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:19,388
<i>I'm not certain how much longer</i>
<i>I can keep the both of them.</i>

160
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:23,986
I have diabetes. And I don't
have the energy that I used to.

161
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,657
<i>And Kelly is a real handful.</i>

162
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,360
I've asked Children's Services
to look for alternatives.

163
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:33,030
- Did Kelly know?
- Yes. I told her.

164
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,335
<i>[Boy]</i>
<i>Did they find Kelly or not?</i>

165
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,673
No, Alex.
But they found Dylan.

166
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,008
Is he all right?

167
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,613
I'm-I'm afraid not.

168
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,620
Dylan is dead.

169
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,019
Do you know where Kelly is, Alex?

170
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,063
- No.
- Kelly could be in danger.

171
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,895
I don't know where she is.

172
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:06,803
She hasn't called me or anything.
Do you think she's dead too?

173
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,966
No. Mm-mmm. You know,
I'm gonna find your sister...

174
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,374
and I'm gonna bring her
back here to you.

175
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,003
Really?

176
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,073
Mmm, absolutely.
This is the F.B.I., buddy.

177
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,755
Were you lying to the boy? Do you really
think Kelly Morris is still alive?

178
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,587
- I don't know.
- You don't know if she's alive?

179
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:30,390
I don't know if I was lying. I really
don't have a read on the sister yet.

180
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,931
I mean, was she a bad guy?
Was she a victim?

181
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,933
Do you have a read on Dylan Crane?

182
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:38,903
Oh, yeah. He had that whole adolescent
savior complex thing going on big time.

183
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,769
- Savior complex?
- Yeah, teenage boys love nothing more...

184
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,833
than the idea of saving
the damsel in distress.

185
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,244
- How do you know?
- Well, 'cause I was, you know...
I was a teenage boy.

186
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,847
<i>Hey. D.N.A. from the tissue under</i>
<i>the victim's fingernail.</i>

187
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,615
Female. And there's nail polish
in the gouges on his arm.

188
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,680
It wasn't necessarily
from the murder.

189
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,692
They were sexually active.
She might've scratched him.

190
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,854
Nope. Hodgins also found
oxidized iron in the scratches.

191
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:07,797
- Oxidized iron. What's that?
- [Saroyan, Brennan] Rust.

192
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:11,268
- Why didn't you just say rust?
- Well, <i>she</i> said it.

193
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,636
The same oxidized iron found
on the victim's upper back and shoulder.

194
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,198
Probably left behind
by the weapon that struck him.

195
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:22,145
- So he was hit with what, a rusty pipe?
- That's a reasonable assumption.

196
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,444
<i>Oh, so Dylan tells</i>
<i>the girlfriend they're breaking up.</i>

197
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,315
- She whacks him across the carotid with a pipe.
- Pushes him out the window.

198
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,377
- Exactly.
- What?

199
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,219
<i>What's with the stink eye?</i>
<i>It's just a theory.</i>

200
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,988
There was cheap nail polish
in the box of Kelly's belongings.

201
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,996
You should see if there's a match.

202
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,727
Find some hair.
Match the D.N.A. on that.

203
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,769
- Then get started on the, uh, murder weapon.
- Yeah.

204
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,100
<i>Where you going?</i>

205
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,005
I thought before we arrest
Kelly Morris for murder...

206
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,566
based solely on the fact
that she's a foster kid...

207
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:55,171
we might want to find the place
where Dylan Crane actually died.

208
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:58,444
<i>Point of fact, the pipe, if that's even</i>
<i>what it was, was not the murder weapon.</i>

209
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:02,954
The evidence, if anybody cares,
shows that Dylan Crane died from a fall.

210
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,115
[Whistles]

211
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,491
No compression fractures
to the ulna or phalanges.

212
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,193
So his arms weren't outstretched
or across his face.

213
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,201
Which means he wasn't
bracing for impact.

214
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,863
Suggesting he was unconscious
before he went out the window.

215
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,032
Perhaps from being struck
by the rusty pipe?

216
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,542
- [Grunts] Don't you start.
- Start what?

217
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,239
- We don't know what he was struck with yet.
- I analyzed the impact damage...

218
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:32,011
and the weapon was a cylinder
approximately two inches in diameter.

219
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:37,522
That, plus the oxidation residue,
suggests, in the vernacular, a rusty pipe.

220
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,890
Good. If you tell me that, I get it.
It's empirical, not guesswork.

221
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:46,364
<i>That which we call a rose</i>
<i>by any other name would smell as sweet.</i>

222
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,366
<i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>
act 2, scene 2...

223
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:52,370
the quote considered to most aptly
describe the central conflict of the play...

224
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,668
which I totally do not understand.

225
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,471
The flower in Dylan's hand
was a <i>Rosea calyx...</i> a rosebud.

226
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,308
You do <i>not</i> smell like a rose.

227
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,373
I've been sifting through two tons of
garbage, which you should ask me about.

228
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,510
Ask what exactly?

229
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,214
Poultry skin loaded
with garlic and chives, red beets...

230
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,315
empty imported vodka bottles,
and traces of osetra fish eggs.

231
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,326
Put 'em together and where are we?

232
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,885
<i>Anyone?</i>

233
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:23,162
Booth should check the garbage truck
route for a Russian restaurant.

234
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,636
- <i>[Vehicles Passing]</i>
- Whoa, okay. Horrible area.

235
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:32,199
But on the upside, only one
Russian restaurant and no Starbucks.

236
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,339
You know, no one we've talked to
has recognized either Kelly or Dylan.

237
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,441
- Hey, we could ask them.
- Why?

238
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:44,615
Because they share the same unique
sociocultural identifiers as Kelly Morris.

239
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,215
- You mean like teenagers?
- Yeah, exactly.

240
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:50,626
No, you know what? They will melt away
before we get half a sentence out.

241
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:53,597
- Right. You just watch.
- Okay. But, hey, you know, what do I know?

242
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,066
- I've only been working the streets
my whole career.
- <i>Excuse me?</i>

243
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,069
Excuse me? Hello.

244
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:02,597
- Hi. I'm an anthropologist. I'm not a cop.
- That's most definitely a cop.

245
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,973
<i>Thank you. See?</i>
<i>They're very cooperative, aren't they?</i>

246
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,978
- Booth, please...
- There they go.

247
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,879
Oh, excuse me.
Wait, wait, wait.

248
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:14,443
Will you just take a look at these pictures
and tell me if you recognize anyone?

249
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,285
<i>Give me five bucks,</i>
<i>and I'll tell you.</i>

250
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:22,225
- Five bucks.
- Booth, please.

251
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,894
Here you go.

252
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,330
So who is it?

253
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,459
It's his sister.
But hold it this way, right?

254
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,903
'Cause the only time anyone
ever sees his sister is on her back.

255
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,601
<i>Yeah. I'm assuming</i>
<i>this isn't your sister?</i>

256
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:42,943
- No, it is!
- Okay, I'd like my money back.

257
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,313
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>Well, there they go. Bye.</i>

258
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,251
<i>Mm-hmm. That really worked,</i>
<i>now, didn't it, huh?</i>

259
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,811
Great.

260
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,824
They just took my money for nothing.

261
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,350
Well, you know, that's because they're
exploited, you know, misunderstood.

262
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,495
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>Oh, you gotta be kidding me, huh?</i>

263
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:05,765
- I mean, they could at least wait
until my back is turned, right?
- What?

264
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,772
- <i>F.B.I. Hands in the air.</i>
- Cops!

265
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,003
There's no problem here!
No problem at all. Katie!

266
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,806
I'll cover you.
Go see what they're dealing, Bones.

267
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:19,009
I hate this part where you stand
with a gun and I have to do the looking.

268
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,052
Bones, I got you covered. Just go.

269
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,881
<i>What are you selling?</i>

270
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,484
What do they got there, Bones?
What do you got, huh?

271
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:33,053
Ibuprofen, uh, multivitamin.

272
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:37,660
<i>I think these are sandwiches.</i>
<i>And condoms.</i>

273
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,340
[Man] Franny and I have been
doing this for years.

274
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,468
[Franny]
Sandwiches, clothing, vitamins.

275
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:48,672
Some basic hygiene supplies
for homeless kids.

276
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:52,239
- You must be really embarrassed.
- Hey, you know what? It was
suspicious behavior, all right?

277
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:55,151
And besides, it's not like they're...
Are you social workers?

278
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,654
- Nope.
- They aren't social workers.

279
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,089
- They're good Samaritans.
- Well, I apologized, okay?

280
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,627
Do you know how long it takes
to gain trust around here?

281
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,528
Make a scene like this,
and these kids won't talk to us for weeks.

282
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:09,829
Oh, good. Maybe you could do us
a favor in return. Show him the picture.

283
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:13,770
We're looking for someone. A girl.

284
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,036
- Dylan and Kelly.
- Yeah. That's right.

285
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:20,510
- We haven't seen 'em around here
in a couple of weeks.
- Dylan is dead.

286
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:24,106
<i>We found him in a garbage truck</i>
<i>that services this area.</i>

287
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:27,584
- My God. What happened?
- That's what we're trying to figure out.

288
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,348
Warehouse.

289
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,116
Yep. Come with us.

290
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,296
- What is this place?
- A squat.

291
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,525
Every one of these old factories
houses junkies and squatters.

292
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,533
Yeah, and kids
with nowhere else to go.

293
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,125
What'd this building used to be?

294
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,967
- Plumbing supply, I think.
- Pipes.

295
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,599
Bones. Dylan, right?

296
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,079
It's obviously a kind of shrine.

297
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,612
<i>It's something the kids do</i>
<i>for each other when somebody dies.</i>

298
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,885
Still could be traces of Dylan's blood on
the concrete. I'll call the crime scene unit.

299
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,654
- Tell them to start on the fifth floor.
- Why?

300
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,752
Because the injuries show
that's how far he fell.

301
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,660
- <i>[Glass Shatters]</i>
- [Boy Grunts]

302
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:17,600
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
That's Dylan's school jacket!

303
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:21,435
We're not gonna hurt you!
[Groans]

304
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,235
Okay.
I hurt you a little bit...

305
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,608
but that's only because you ran.

306
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,880
You can't ask me nothing without a social
worker present. I know my rights.

307
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:38,753
I'm not questioning you.
We're just... We're talking, okay?

308
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,486
Here, want some gum?

309
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,586
Yeah, like that's gonna
make me trust you.

310
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,266
You know, I'm just asking your name.

311
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,598
- <i>[Man] Sergeant Roberts is up top.</i>
- "C."

312
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,639
- Does that stand for anything?
- Carter.

313
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:57,140
I'm not saying if that's
my first or my last name.

314
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,200
- Why'd you run?
- Because this lady was chasing me.

315
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,838
- Because you ran.
- Yeah. It's a brain twister.

316
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,008
<i>You know, that sweatshirt you're wearing</i>
<i>belongs to a kid by the name of Dylan Crane.</i>

317
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,518
- Never heard of him.
- Where'd you get it?

318
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:12,681
I'm done with the hoodie.
You guys can have it.

319
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,858
What's with the names on the inside
of your forearm there? What does that mean?

320
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,364
Guys I killed.

321
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,799
It's a list of foster homes.
Ones that threw him out.

322
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,360
Sometimes getting thrown out's
the best...

323
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,566
It's the best thing that can happen.
I know.

324
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,909
You were in the system?

325
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:41,150
Booth, the sunglasses? They're the same ones
that Dylan was wearing in the photograph.

326
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,553
These, huh? Top of the line.
How can you afford these?

327
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,353
You don't want to know.
Can I go now?

328
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,758
No. Child Services is on the way.

329
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,659
I tell you something, you let me go?

330
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,096
- Try me.
- You want to know what happened
to Dylan and Kelly?

331
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,100
Check out the sandwich pervs.

332
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,367
<i>Fran Duncan's clean.</i>
<i>Great record in the community.</i>

333
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,135
But Kevin Duncan?
The kid got it right. I mean, he's a perv.

334
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,109
Inside three times
on "solicitation of minor" charges.

335
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:09,011
- Boys or girls?
- Girls. He's a traditionalist.

336
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,914
[Sighs]
So, he went after Kelly.

337
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,612
The white knight from the suburbs
steps in, gets conked with a pipe...

338
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,814
- and tossed out the window.
- And Kelly goes into hiding.

339
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,121
Unless he got her too.
So what do you want to do next?

340
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,218
Hmm. That's up to Cam, isn't it?

341
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:27,629
No, Bones, I asked you.
What do you want to do?

342
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,959
I think...

343
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:34,335
I think we shouldn't close off
any avenue of investigation.

344
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:37,534
We stay on all the evidence
and see where it leads us.

345
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,543
Like we did before Cam.

346
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,409
Okay.

347
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,976
Do you have a list like Carter?

348
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:50,078
Of foster families that didn't work out?
Yeah. We all did.

349
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:54,216
- I wrote mine on the bottom of a shoe.
- Oh.

350
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,761
You know, they say with foster kids,
they're really hard on themselves.

351
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,386
They?

352
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:02,763
Yeah, experts, psychologists,
like that.

353
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:05,803
<i>Apparently, foster kids feel</i>
<i>so alone in this mean world...</i>

354
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,238
they lose that knack
of trusting other people.

355
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,969
You mean at work?

356
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,307
Uh, everywhere.
You know, weight of the world.

357
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,074
It's... It's profound.

358
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:19,117
<i>They say that they have a hard time</i>
<i>letting themselves off the hook.</i>

359
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:22,347
They... They grow up with control issues.

360
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,981
- Are you telling me something, Booth?
- <i>No.</i>

361
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,424
I'm just saying it's something to keep in
consideration when we catch up with Kelly Morris.

362
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,427
Okay.

363
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:34,591
If you decide to take some other wisdom
out of it, none of my business.

364
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,965
How Cam and I get along
<i>is</i> none of your business.

365
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,970
Yeah, right.
Which I just said.

366
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:43,701
Said just then... None of my business.

367
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,142
[Computer Beeping]

368
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,224
<i>Is there anything I can do?</i>

369
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,385
Hey, this schematic is great, Angela.

370
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,725
<i>All the pipes</i>
<i>are numbered and located.</i>

371
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,162
Meanwhile, I have hundreds
of rust samples...

372
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,598
and I've covered, mmm,
maybe a quarter of the crime scene.

373
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,329
- [Groans]
- Yeah.

374
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:15,533
On the good side, that is definitely
the window Dylan Crane exited as he fell.

375
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,871
Leaded glass is a match.

376
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,003
It's a strange place
for two people in love to end up.

377
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,138
What? A forensics lab?

378
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:27,208
No. A squat in
an abandoned pipe factory.

379
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,277
Right. Yes. Right.

380
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,687
What were <i>you</i> talking about?

381
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,591
- Just Cam and Booth, you know, of course.
- Oh, yeah.

382
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,687
- Given their... their history.
- Mmm.

383
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,000
Tension, party of two.

384
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,873
Great. Great.

385
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,875
[Groans]
Okay.

386
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,940
All my mistakes were made
before I met Fran.

387
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,142
Then I fell in love.
Love changes everything.

388
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:03,710
- Your wife know about these mistakes?
- Of course.

389
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:07,054
We have no secrets. I got counseling.
I'm still in counseling.

390
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,423
I'm out there on the street
making amends every day.

391
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:13,590
Passing out sandwiches and aspirin
and condoms to street kids?

392
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:17,761
Yeah. I have no direct contact with the kids.
Fran does.

393
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,031
<i>I make the sandwiches.</i>

394
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:24,098
I drive. Insure my wife's safety.
That's a tough part of town.

395
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,475
And your past is all in the past?

396
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:30,447
No. That's with me every day.

397
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,449
Yeah.

398
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:37,252
Miranda Tyler, Susan Price,
Laura Costello.

399
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:41,418
All these girls say that you traded
sandwiches for sex in the past six months.

400
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,427
Well, they're street kids.
They lie.

401
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:47,295
- Yeah.
- <i>These girls came on to me.</i>

402
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,334
And they wanted money.

403
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,596
When I rejected them,
they got angry.

404
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:56,107
We catch up to Kelly Morris, is
she gonna say the same thing?

405
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,343
<i>Hairbrush from Kelly's room</i>
<i>provided her D.N.A.</i>

406
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,679
The nail polish from her room
also matches...

407
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,743
the nail polish we found in
the scratch marks on the victim's arm.

408
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,583
It doesn't mean
she pushed him out that window.

409
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:13,954
<i>lfhe finds it, and it matches the rust</i>
<i>found in the scratch marks...</i>

410
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,960
- then we can tie Kelly to the weapon.
- Oh, young love.

411
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,360
You pour your soul out
to some pimple-faced jock...

412
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:22,525
with a great body and the emotional
maturity of an 11 -year-old...

413
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,866
only to get your heart broken
in the back of a red Camaro.

414
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:28,599
- Remember that first slow dance?
- Oh, God.

415
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:32,336
- Some horrible power ballad.
- Oh, that special boy with a pipe in his pocket.

416
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,778
Oh, God. Lewis Cole.

417
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:39,010
<i>Mmm. He was a drummer.</i>
<i>He had this hair. It was...</i>

418
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,520
Wait. Excuse me? Marching to the beat
of a different drummer here.

419
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:46,648
I'd like Hodgins to <i>identify</i> the species
of rose found in Dylan Crane's hand.

420
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:50,161
- What can that possibly tell us?
- I won't know until he identifies it.

421
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:54,392
I'd prefer he keep looking for the pipe.
It could have Kevin Dylan's D.N.A. on it.

422
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,867
Which will prove only that Kevin Duncan
struck Dylan, not that he killed him.

423
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,337
- I want Hodgins on that rose.
- It's my call. No.

424
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:04,842
[Sighs]
I can't work like this.

425
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,311
Are you telling me I should
start looking for your replacement?

426
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,543
<i>Dr. Saroyan, I don't want to be</i>
<i>overly dramatic or anything.</i>

427
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:15,074
But if you lose Brennan,
you lose us all.

428
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,981
- Really?
- Really.

429
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:22,219
And Booth too.

430
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:31,865
In the interests of this investigation,
I'm going to defer to you, Dr. Brennan.

431
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:35,737
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

432
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,140
But I will start the search
for your replacement.

433
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,352
- <i>[Man] Agent Booth?</i>
- Yeah?

434
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,856
This young man says he has information
he won't tell anyone but you.

435
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,255
All right.
Thanks, I got it.

436
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,954
Come on in, Alex.
Have a seat.

437
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,223
[Sighs]

438
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:04,430
- You want a Coke or anything?
- No.

439
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:10,871
- You a big shot?
- [Scoffs] Uh, yeah.

440
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:14,639
Look at that, huh?
Special Agent <i>in Charge</i> Seeley Booth.

441
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:20,440
- So how'd you get here?
- Bus.

442
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,546
- Kelly called me on the phone.
- What'd she say?

443
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:27,888
That she's okay.

444
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:31,759
And that we'll be together...
soon.

445
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,162
Did she say where she was?

446
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,996
Did she know about Dylan?
About being dead?

447
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:44,904
Yeah. She couldn't
stop crying about it.

448
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,513
She had to hang up.

449
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,950
<i>I think she's lying.</i>

450
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,782
<i>I think she's never coming back.</i>
<i>[Sniffles]</i>

451
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,517
Hey, it's okay, Alex.
All right?

452
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,756
Everything's gonna be okay.

453
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,594
[Crying]
I think I'm all alone now.

454
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,760
No. Hey, look.

455
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:13,668
Hey, man, you're never
gonna be alone, okay?

456
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,899
All right, we know for certain
that Kelly is alive.

457
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:19,307
And I promise.
We're gonna find your sister.

458
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:22,972
Okay? All right.

459
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:26,142
Let's get out of here.
I'll give you a ride home.

460
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,811
- I got your call.
- It was urgent. Why didn't you answer?

461
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,823
I was busy.
What's so important?

462
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,457
- Kevin Duncan.
- Single gunshot wound to the chest.

463
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,624
You're just in time for the autopsy.

464
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,511
Feeling queasy, Zack?

465
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:58,208
I'm not used to bodies looking so much
like actual human beings.

466
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,309
[Saw Whirring]

467
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:03,320
- <i>[Bone Cracking]</i>
- [Groans]

468
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:06,789
Since this man was just killed
and there's plenty of flesh...

469
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,349
how is my presence beneficial?

470
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:15,697
<i>[Bone Cracking]</i>

471
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,207
The number six rib.

472
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:28,075
<i>The bullet passed through his vital organs</i>
<i>and lodged in the rear curvature.</i>

473
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,539
Get it out.

474
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:37,180
So, you're thinking the perv kills Romeo
and Juliet kills the pervert.

475
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:40,281
Street-smart kid like Kelly Morris
would have no trouble getting a gun.

476
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:41,791
Mm-hmm.

477
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,495
Booth, if Dr. Brennan
were to quit...

478
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:50,028
- What?
- If she were to leave theJeffersonian...

479
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:53,537
Well, the squints would flee
this institution like the French army.

480
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,439
- And you?
- Well, I do as I'm ordered.

481
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,477
[Scoffs]
No, you don't, Seeley.

482
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,737
Okay, here we go.
What's going on, Camille?

483
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,316
What if I fired her?
What would you do?

484
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:14,753
I'm with Bones, Cam.
All the way.

485
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,794
Don't doubt it for a second.

486
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,563
Meet the English Alba Rose.

487
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:23,658
Climbing varietal.
Nonexistent in the United States.

488
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:27,967
<i>Some say it was the rose by any other name</i>
<i>Shakespeare wrote about.</i>

489
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,132
And we give a rat's ass because?

490
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,506
It's what Dylan Crane was
clutching in his cold, dead hand.

491
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:34,408
So, what?
He was killed by Hamlet?

492
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,413
Wrong play.

493
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:40,315
It's more likely he paid a visit to the rose wing
of the United States Botanic Garden.

494
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:44,014
When it comes to bugs, slime,
crud, and compost, you're the man.

495
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:48,051
- [Chuckles]
- <i>Look, Cam.</i>

496
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:51,186
<i>Maybe you just got off on the wrong foot</i>
<i>with this case with Brennan...</i>

497
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:53,958
because, uh, she was a foster kid.

498
00:28:55,433 --> 00:29:00,336
<i>Oh. [Sighs]</i>
<i>Why didn't she tell me?</i>

499
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,499
She doesn't do that.
[Clears Throat] Excuse me.

500
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:07,807
Oh, by the way,
I didn't just tell you that.

501
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,882
<i>[Hodgins] United States Botanic Garden</i>
<i>falls under the supervision...</i>

502
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,147
- of the Architect of the Capitol.
- I really don't care.

503
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,155
The architect is also responsible...

504
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,157
for maintaining the grounds
of the United States Capitol.

505
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,159
You seen either of these two kids?

506
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:25,196
It's open every day of the year to the citizens
of these United States.

507
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,197
Which way to
the <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> roses?

508
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,495
It's over there
where Kelly Morris is standing.

509
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:36,469
Oh, Bones was right.
Okay, go distract her.

510
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:39,476
- Well, hey. Why me?
- Well, because apparently I look like a cop.

511
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:43,036
- What do I look like?
- What are you? My straight man? Go.

512
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,156
Hey.

513
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:57,552
The United States Botanic Garden
falls under...

514
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,894
the supervision of
the Architect of the Capitol.

515
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,956
- Get away from me, perv.
- Hello, Kelly.

516
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:05,161
F.B.I.
Not a perv.

517
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:08,728
It's okay. It's okay.
We're just here to help.

518
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:12,038
Not gonna hurt you. Just gotta
talk about what happened to Dylan.

519
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,112
Dylan's dead.

520
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,080
Were you there when Dylan died?

521
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,343
Was I there?

522
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,884
Who do you think killed him?

523
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,089
- Why'd you kill Dylan, Kelly?
- Agent Booth.

524
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,859
She already admitted to the murder,
Ms. Child.

525
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,424
Actually, I believe she asked
"Who do you think killed him?"

526
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:42,303
- It's an ambiguous question.
- Oh, I killed him. I did it.

527
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,972
Because he broke a promise to me.

528
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,807
The promise to stay with you?

529
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:51,042
He tossed me a couple hundred bucks
and told me he was going to college...

530
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,083
that we couldn't
see each other anymore.

531
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:56,746
- What'd you do?
- I pushed him out a window.

532
00:30:56,821 --> 00:31:00,313
<i>It was kind of an accident, right?</i>
<i>What do you call it? A crime of passion?</i>

533
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:03,258
- You pushed him out the window?
- Yes.

534
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,989
And he was conscious at the time?

535
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:07,258
Yeah. He screamed, okay?

536
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,668
- What then?
- I ran away.

537
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:14,830
No. Kelly, you didn't.

538
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:18,000
You went down to the alley,
and you wrapped Dylan in linen.

539
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:21,944
<i>And then you put a rose from</i>
<i>the Botanic Garden in his hand.</i>

540
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,004
The <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> rose.

541
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:28,416
<i>You know, it's a strange thing to do</i>
<i>right after you murder someone.</i>

542
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,750
Well, I'm pretty screwed up.
Didn't you hear?

543
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,813
Someone shot Kevin Duncan.

544
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,825
- <i>He's dead.</i>
- The sandwich guy?

545
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,794
We were thinking that
the two deaths were connected.

546
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,458
[Sighs]
Fine. Yeah, I killed him too.

547
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:47,698
- She killed him too.
- I'd prefer that we not pursue
this line of questioning.

548
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:57,208
<i>[Register Beeping]</i>

549
00:31:57,282 --> 00:32:00,809
- Well, she confessed.
- She got it wrong. She forgot about the pipe.

550
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:03,149
- She said they fought.
- She's lying.

551
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,883
[Sighs] You know, I'm just trying
to think of a situation so bad...

552
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:09,290
where a girl would confess to murder
to try and get out of it.

553
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:14,691
- Agent Booth. Dr. Brennan.
- Mrs. Duncan.

554
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,859
You want to sit down?
Have a cup of coffee?

555
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,960
No, thank you.

556
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,164
I'm sorry for your loss.

557
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:25,039
- Did Kelly Morris kill Dylan?
- Well, she confessed.

558
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,407
And now you think
she killed my husband as well?

559
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:31,073
It's very possible. I'd believe that
before I believed she killed Dylan.

560
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:33,344
Kelly shouldn't take the blame.

561
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:43,251
<i>You'll find one bullet missing.</i>

562
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:47,221
You're confessing to
your husband's murder?

563
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,234
He used me to get close
to young girls.

564
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,532
I don't know how many
through the years.

565
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:00,669
Frances Duncan, you're under arrest.

566
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:03,680
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used...

567
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:06,046
Thank you.

568
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,051
You have the right to an attorney.

569
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,587
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be... Pick up the gun.

570
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:17,023
Ballistics confirm that the bullet that killed
Kevin Duncan came from Fran Duncan's gun.

571
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,029
- Case closed?
- On Kevin Duncan, definitely.

572
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,031
Since Kelly Morris has confessed...

573
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:24,557
- No. She didn't do it.
- What evidence do you have of that?

574
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:30,232
<i>How about this? Specimen 268...</i>
<i>"right corner of the room" schematic.</i>

575
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:34,108
- You are good.
- Oh, you have no idea.

576
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,702
Are you having a moment?

577
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:39,272
<i>Well, how does finding the pipe</i>
<i>prove that Kelly Morris is lying?</i>

578
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,545
How does her confession not
include the murder weapon?

579
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:44,144
Now for the last time, the pipe
is not the murder weapon.

580
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,156
Dylan Crane died
from a 50-foot fall.

581
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:51,218
Can you run the scenario through your
magic holographic crystal ball thingy?

582
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:54,162
Too many variables.
But I have another idea.

583
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,761
Okay.
Booth, you're Dylan Crane.

584
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:01,100
- Okay, you know what? I'm out the door.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

585
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,197
- Cam?
- Kelly Morris. Right.

586
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,606
- Okay, I feel stupid.
- Okay, you two.

587
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:09,077
You are young. You are in love.
You're about to break up.

588
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:12,412
<i>But this is very tragic.</i>
<i>It's very emotionally fraught.</i>

589
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:16,920
<i>Kelly Morris says she argued with Dylan</i>
<i>and pushed him out the window.</i>

590
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,684
She pushed him, then tried to save him
by grabbing his arm?

591
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:22,191
That would explain the fingernail polish
and the scratch. But...

592
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,592
<i>Not the oxidized iron.</i>

593
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:27,187
<i>Kelly would've had to strike him</i>
<i>with the pipe from behind...</i>

594
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:29,165
<i>and then drive him</i>
<i>through the glass.</i>

595
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,997
But she said that
they were arguing face-to-face.

596
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,971
- <i>He would've seen her coming.</i>
- <i>That means there had to be a third person.</i>

597
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,007
Someone who snuck up behind him.

598
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,236
- Guys, I need a Kevin Duncan.
- I'll do it.

599
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,211
Kelly already called me a perv,
so I have my motivation.

600
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,840
So Kevin strikes Dylan
with the pipe.

601
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,211
- Careful.
- Which moves him forward.

602
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:50,220
Kelly grabs the pipe away from him.

603
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,552
But Dylan is losing consciousness.

604
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:55,490
He didn't have to throw Dylan out
the window. He could've simply pushed him.

605
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,721
- Easy.
- Kelly grabs his arm.

606
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:03,295
- <i>[Brennan] To save him.</i>
- Which would put fingernails
and rust in the wound.

607
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,733
But she can't hold him,
and he falls.

608
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:08,533
<i>[Glass Shatters]</i>

609
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,905
- Oh!
- Well, that theory explains the physical evidence.

610
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:17,676
<i>Except why would Kelly confess to murder</i>
<i>to protect Kevin Duncan?</i>

611
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:20,216
- She's afraid of him.
- But she knows he's dead.

612
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:26,015
Guys, there's only
two people in this world...

613
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:30,083
that Kelly Morris would cover for.

614
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,356
One of them went out that window.

615
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:35,862
- We know you didn't kill Dylan.
- I did too.

616
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,992
Kelly, I don't want you
to admit to anything more.

617
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:43,006
No. You didn't. We can prove
there was a third person there...

618
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:46,271
the third person that
hit Dylan with a pipe...

619
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:50,110
and... when you took away the pipe...
pushed him through the glass.

620
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:54,242
No, it was just me. I hit him with the pipe.
I pushed him through the glass.

621
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,685
- No. You grabbed his arm. You tried to save him.
- No.

622
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:17,307
Dylan made you feel like you weren't
alone in this world, right?

623
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:21,576
He was sweet to you.

624
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,945
He took so much weight
off your shoulders.

625
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:30,050
He was good to Alex.

626
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:36,082
And when Dylan said that you'd be
together always, you believed him.

627
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:42,264
Yes. Yes, I believed him.

628
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:47,464
And when Suzanne couldn't
take care of both you and Alex...

629
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,336
you had an idea.

630
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:54,310
Run away with Dylan.

631
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,745
Maybe Suzanne will keep Alex...

632
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:00,579
and everybody would be happy.

633
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:05,586
Dylan loved me.

634
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:08,250
I know.

635
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,025
But I didn't tell Alex.

636
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:16,329
He just...
[Sniffles]

637
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,064
He just... He thought that Dylan was
trying to take me away from him forever.

638
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:27,975
I... I did it all wrong. It's not...

639
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:31,014
It's not Alex's fault.
It's my fault.

640
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,074
<i>[Crying]</i>

641
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:41,858
Kelly, you're 15 years old.

642
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,318
This is not your fault.

643
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:51,893
<i>The weight of the world</i>

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

648
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:44,415
I didn't tell them.
They just...

649
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,422
They just knew.

650
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:52,188
It's okay. [Sniffles]
Sorry about Dylan.

You were right about the pipe.

655
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:29,659
You were right about the rose.

656
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,987
Could I sit for a moment?

659
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:47,735
- We have a problem.
- Uh-huh.

660
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:53,580
- Do you see a solution?
- It's not completely my fault.

661
00:40:56,587 --> 00:41:00,751
I was a foster child.
And apparently...

662
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:03,191
Booth says that...

663
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,490
Booth says that I have...

664
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:09,329
Well, something about control issues
and the weight of the world.

665
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,028
[Chuckles]
That sounds like Booth.

666
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:15,128
I think he meant that...

667
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,936
if I'm going to share responsibility
for these cases...

668
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:22,172
I'm going to have to learn to stop
controlling everything too.

669
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:26,046
Does that make sense?
Psychology's not...

670
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:30,280
I really... I really hate psychology.

671
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:34,450
Not everyone's brain
works as fast as yours.

672
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:37,517
I have to mull sometimes.

673
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,620
A-Are you familiar
with that concept?

674
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:42,860
Yes. I just always thought
it was a waste of time.

675
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:45,834
[Chuckles]

676
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:49,361
I'm in charge. But out of
respect for you, I could extend...

677
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,671
- Did you ever play Monopoly?
- No.

678
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:55,769
Well, they have this thing called
a"get out of jail free" card.

679
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,815
Think of it as a free pass to <i>defy</i> me.

680
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:03,252
No explanation needed.
No recriminations. No repercussions.

681
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:07,589
Well, how... How many would I get?

682
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:10,923
- One a week.
- Five per case.

683
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,486
Three per week.

684
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:21,165
Booth told you
I was a foster kid, didn't he?

685
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:27,834
Okay, yes, he did,
but he did it with a good heart.

686
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:32,144
And I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't let him know. Please.

687
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,583
He's gonna know that you told me
the second he sees us together.

688
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:38,087
It's true. He's awful like that.

689
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:42,990
He reads people the way that you read
pathology reports or I read bones.

690
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,461
Oh, God, I know. I hate him.
Well, I don't really.

691
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:50,899
I know. Me either.

692
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:54,301
- I will take you up on this.
- Please help me.
