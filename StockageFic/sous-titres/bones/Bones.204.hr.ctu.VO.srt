1
00:00:00,853 --> 00:00:03,770
Hikers aren't supposed to let
their dogs off the leash back here,

2
00:00:03,771 --> 00:00:06,771
but i'm pretty sure the dog
was running free when they found the...

3
00:00:06,772 --> 00:00:07,959
what it found.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,942
- What's the condition of the body?
- No idea.

5
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,987
- I can't get close enough to examine it.
- Why not?

6
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:14,823
The dog's definitely not
on his leash at this time.

7
00:00:14,824 --> 00:00:15,824
Oh.

8
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,369
- Put down the bone.
- How the hell are we gonna get to the body?

9
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,638
- Buddy, drop it.
- I don't see this every day.

10
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:22,532
- Drop it.
- Sent for animal control.

11
00:00:22,532 --> 00:00:24,217
It'll take another hour, though.

12
00:00:24,217 --> 00:00:25,313
Drop it now.

13
00:00:25,516 --> 00:00:28,083
I'm so sorry.
He's never done anything like this.

14
00:00:28,288 --> 00:00:30,961
- You ever had a dog, Bones?
- I always wanted a pig.

15
00:00:31,268 --> 00:00:32,493
A pig?

16
00:00:32,498 --> 00:00:35,530
Very smart... and despite
the popular misconception, very clean.

17
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:38,570
I prefer my pig with a little mint,
a little honey glaze...

18
00:00:38,577 --> 00:00:41,921
Not funny. In some cultures,
dogs can guard corpses,

19
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:44,192
sometimes till
the point of starvation, so...

20
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:46,202
shoot it.

21
00:00:46,206 --> 00:00:49,222
No, I'm- I'm not shooting him
for just doing what comes naturally.

22
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:51,190
As far as he's concerned, you know,
finders keepers.

23
00:00:51,195 --> 00:00:55,641
That dog is compromising the integrity
of my remains, so wing it... him.

24
00:00:56,047 --> 00:00:57,652
There's another way, Bones.

25
00:00:58,056 --> 00:00:59,382
Dogs love me.

26
00:01:00,837 --> 00:01:03,321
Nice doggy.
Good pooch.

27
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:07,481
Nice dog.
Good pooch.

28
00:01:08,386 --> 00:01:11,691
Okay. Hey, we're just going to wait
for animal control.

29
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:15,212
- I'll do it.
- Oh, yeah.

30
00:01:16,435 --> 00:01:18,130
Yeah, pine cone's really going...
work.

31
00:01:18,535 --> 00:01:20,220
Buddy! Buddy.

32
00:01:20,328 --> 00:01:22,022
- Okay,
- Come back here!

33
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:24,750
I need everybody to clear the area.
Set up a perimeter.

34
00:01:24,756 --> 00:01:26,980
Clear the area.
Set up a perimeter.

35
00:01:27,748 --> 00:01:29,462
- And tell animal control
- Yeah.

36
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:30,862
- I need that bone back.
- Right, first

37
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:32,613
thing I do when they get here.

38
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,690
Victim was female, late teens.

39
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:45,190
Blonde. Cause of death looks like
blunt trauma to the back of the skull.

40
00:01:45,196 --> 00:01:46,872
She was buried face down.

41
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,562
What's that,
some satanic hoo-ha?

42
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:52,113
My uncle Preston wants to be buried
standing up without a casket.

43
00:01:54,517 --> 00:01:58,112
Pupal casings and insect remains suggest she
was buried out there seven to ten years ago.

44
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:01,712
Placement of wrists and ankles
suggests she was bound.

45
00:02:01,715 --> 00:02:04,891
Residue on the medial malleolus
might tell us what restraints were used.

46
00:02:04,895 --> 00:02:06,033
Oh, look at that.

47
00:02:06,037 --> 00:02:09,461
Yeah, wear to her right
lateral epicondyle and rotator cuff.

48
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:12,642
Also repetitive motion damage
to the lower lumbar vertebrae.

49
00:02:12,646 --> 00:02:14,873
- What's that mean?
- Golf.

50
00:02:16,657 --> 00:02:19,612
Hi, Angela.
you look great today.

51
00:02:19,618 --> 00:02:21,511
Thanks, Hodgy. This is my

52
00:02:21,527 --> 00:02:25,250
boho-rocker-artist, mid-week,
take-a-deep-breath-and-pout look.

53
00:02:25,256 --> 00:02:26,610
Hodgy?

54
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:32,600
Uh, I did a facial reconstruction
extrapolating skin tone from hair color.

55
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,830
For the record, I hate the guy
who killed this girl,

56
00:02:36,836 --> 00:02:38,943
and I hope to hell
he burns in all eternity.

57
00:02:39,586 --> 00:02:41,253
- That our victim?
- Yeah. I found

58
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:44,030
flecks of black enamel paint in the wound.

59
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:46,030
Shape suggests a tire iron.

60
00:02:46,757 --> 00:02:48,062
Tire iron.

61
00:02:50,686 --> 00:02:51,783
Tire iron.

62
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:53,470
Hands and feet bound.

63
00:02:53,478 --> 00:02:55,481
Buried face down.

64
00:02:57,106 --> 00:02:58,762
Epps.

65
00:03:00,506 --> 00:03:02,711
Hello. New team member in the room.

66
00:03:02,728 --> 00:03:05,032
Howard Epps;
Serial killer on death row.

67
00:03:05,138 --> 00:03:07,593
- Killed at least three.
- We found two of them last year.

68
00:03:07,597 --> 00:03:10,613
The judge stayed his execution to try him
on the new charges.

69
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:13,060
You saved his life.
Ironic.

70
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,501
The time frame fits.

71
00:03:14,507 --> 00:03:17,883
This girl would've been killed about
six months before Epps went to prison.

72
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:19,903
Run it through the database, get an I.D.

73
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:21,121
- Why don't you just ask him?
- Well,

74
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:23,343
because last time Bones saw Epps, it...

75
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:25,163
got violent.

76
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:26,782
You'll be there to protect her.

77
00:03:26,788 --> 00:03:28,590
She's not the one who needs protecting.

78
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:30,512
Bones broke his wrist.

79
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:37,023
He touched me with his creepy
serial killer hands.

80
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:39,690
Better not take Dr. Brennan.

81
00:03:47,888 --> 00:03:49,500
Agent Booth,

82
00:03:49,816 --> 00:03:51,523
what took you so long?

83
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:56,841
And where's Dr. Brennan?

84
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:03,102
Bones
Episode 2x04 - The blonde in the game.

Resynch: hanest

87
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,901
Who is this?

88
00:04:39,908 --> 00:04:42,513
Oh, that's right, you're chained.

89
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:47,871
- How about removing these shackles?
- The name, Howie.

90
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:49,990
The name.

91
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:55,191
You know...

92
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:58,181
Those hack doctors at the prison infirmary

93
00:04:58,986 --> 00:05:01,361
did a miserable job setting my wrist.

94
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:02,832
It aches all the time,

95
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,883
and I don't have a full range of movement,
and let me tell you,

96
00:05:05,887 --> 00:05:08,890
when you're stuck in a prison cell
for 23 hours a day,

97
00:05:08,897 --> 00:05:11,841
there's really only one thing you can do
to pass the time,

98
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:13,721
and I need my wrist.

99
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:19,302
Well, I'm sure Dr. Brennan would be happy
to re-break it for you.

100
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:23,460
- What's that?
- Oh, these?

101
00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:27,291
These are crime scene photos.
The ones you like.

102
00:05:27,298 --> 00:05:31,501
Tell you what. You, uh...
you tell me the girl's name, I'll, uh,

103
00:05:31,508 --> 00:05:33,203
let you take a look.

104
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:37,263
Everything you need to win the game
is right there in front of you.

105
00:05:37,268 --> 00:05:41,150
Game?
You bored, huh?

106
00:05:41,357 --> 00:05:43,082
Are you playing us?

107
00:05:43,088 --> 00:05:47,021
When Dr. Brennan figures it out,
come and see me again, but

108
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:50,143
bring your lady scientist.
Otherwise...

109
00:05:50,846 --> 00:05:52,223
I don't say a word.

110
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:56,223
Next time you see either one of us,
they'll be giving you a lethal injection.

111
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:12,052
Classic game theory;
Throwing down of the gauntlet.

112
00:06:12,256 --> 00:06:13,253
What?

113
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:15,853
Conflict of interest arises,
followed by a series of moves

114
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:18,020
from which divergent strategies
can be discerned.

115
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:20,160
- What did he say?
- Epps is playing us.

116
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,830
- Yes, that's exactly what I said.
- Zero-sum, obviously.

117
00:06:22,837 --> 00:06:25,631
After a few moves, we'll know
Epps' order of preference.

118
00:06:25,647 --> 00:06:27,642
- What did he say?
- We'll find out what Epps wants.

119
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:29,380
Look, I already know what he wants.
I told you;

120
00:06:29,387 --> 00:06:31,520
he wants Bones sitting across the
table from him.

121
00:06:31,528 --> 00:06:33,680
Three rational players;
Me, Booth and Epps.

122
00:06:33,687 --> 00:06:35,700
What about the non-deliberative agent?

123
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,400
- What did she say?
- In a game, there tends to

124
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:41,610
be one "n" rational players, and
a non-conscious, non-deliberative agent.

125
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:46,062
What did Epps talk about
before he said all the information

126
00:06:46,065 --> 00:06:47,490
you needed was in front of you?

127
00:06:47,496 --> 00:06:52,022
Mom, Bones, blondes, his wrist being
set badly after Bones broke it,

128
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:54,483
and, um, you know, he...

129
00:06:54,486 --> 00:06:58,120
he made the point that
he really needed his wrist.

130
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,643
Chronic masturbation.

131
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:06,550
The game may be
all about self-gratification.

132
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:10,120
The phrase he used was
"right in front" of us.

133
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:10,921
Yes.

134
00:07:11,127 --> 00:07:12,830
The blonde is right in front of us.

135
00:07:12,838 --> 00:07:15,792
And she has a wrist.
Well, two, in fact.

136
00:07:15,998 --> 00:07:18,160
You know, if you had a pet pig,
what would you name him?

137
00:07:19,568 --> 00:07:20,652
- Jasper.
- Hmm.

138
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:23,230
This wrist looks completely normal.

139
00:07:23,435 --> 00:07:25,853
Here; The right hamate bone.

140
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:30,690
Oh, coloration is off.

141
00:07:30,798 --> 00:07:33,901
It's slightly greasy compared
to the surrounding bone.

142
00:07:33,908 --> 00:07:35,580
It's about...

143
00:07:35,885 --> 00:07:39,762
an eighth of an inch bigger than
the same bone in the outside.

144
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:42,337
This hamate bone does not belong
with these remains.

145
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,213
It belongs with the second body.

146
00:07:44,616 --> 00:07:47,303
There's another victim out there...
somewhere.

147
00:07:48,777 --> 00:07:51,133
Round one...
goes to Howard Epps.

148
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,821
- Why?
- Because he gets what he wants:

149
00:07:55,427 --> 00:07:57,203
Me in the room with him.

150
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:05,491
Who's that?

151
00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:07,721
Oh, that is, uh, Caroline Epps.

152
00:08:07,726 --> 00:08:09,261
Howard's sister?

153
00:08:09,268 --> 00:08:11,743
Uh, no...
Howard's wife.

154
00:08:11,748 --> 00:08:13,623
Well, he didn't have a wife last year.

155
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:15,520
Oh, they got married
about four months ago.

156
00:08:15,526 --> 00:08:17,650
Heads up, Bones;
It's our turn to visit the psychotic,

157
00:08:17,655 --> 00:08:19,451
- murderous maniac.
- Bastard.

158
00:08:20,155 --> 00:08:24,410
Hi, Mrs. Epps. I'm Special Agent
Seeley Booth. This is Dr. Brennan.

159
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:28,031
Oh, Agent Booth, Howard's told me
you both saved his life last year.

160
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:31,230
- It was our pleasure.
- What?! I was disappointed.

161
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:35,180
Extending Howard's life has
given him time to come to grips

162
00:08:35,188 --> 00:08:37,770
with what he's done, to ask god
for forgiveness.

163
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:40,310
Then we did the right thing
by having his execution stayed.

164
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:42,441
- Are you on some kind of medication?
- Bones...

165
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:45,383
Dr. Brennan, I'm not one
of those crazy women

166
00:08:45,387 --> 00:08:47,380
who falls in love
with death row killers.

167
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:49,022
Obviously, that's exactly what you are.

168
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:51,423
Listen, if the prison ever gives you
a hard time in coming to

169
00:08:51,428 --> 00:08:53,800
see your husband, just give me a call.
I might be able to help.

170
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:56,120
- Thank you, Agent Booth.
- Are you serious? She's crazy.

171
00:08:56,128 --> 00:08:57,902
Chop-chop, let's go.
Thank you. Nice to see you.

172
00:08:57,906 --> 00:09:00,082
- Nice to meet you both.
- Why are we nice to her?

173
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:01,671
'cause we might need her.

174
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:04,072
Ah, Dr. Brennan,...

175
00:09:04,838 --> 00:09:06,051
you came.

176
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:10,432
I got your message.
We're analyzing the wrist bone right now.

177
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:15,523
We just met your wife.
She seems very nice.

178
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:17,303
Caroline's a hairdresser.

179
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:20,433
I'm glad you came.

180
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:23,673
Hope you come back
after you analyze the bone.

181
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,501
Caroline's the best I could do in here.

182
00:09:26,506 --> 00:09:28,550
Yeah, not your usual type, Howie.

183
00:09:28,557 --> 00:09:30,590
I mean, not young, not blonde..

184
00:09:30,598 --> 00:09:32,921
- Not dead.
- Bones, could you please shut up?

185
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,230
Excuse me?

186
00:09:34,238 --> 00:09:37,991
Is this why you duct-taped their mouths?
Because that I understand.

187
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:45,033
That's the lamest attempt
at bonding I've ever seen.

188
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,732
- You smell that?
- What, my stinky effort to bond?

189
00:09:54,737 --> 00:09:58,040
Antiseptic.
My mother smelled like that.

190
00:09:58,246 --> 00:10:01,671
Obsessed with germs.
She washed her hands with ammonia.

191
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:03,190
Mine, too.

192
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:07,562
My one regret?
I didn't make her my first victim.

193
00:10:07,966 --> 00:10:10,273
Put her under a little
stone cross years ago.

194
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:12,192
Okay.

195
00:10:14,226 --> 00:10:15,862
- Okay, what?
- Okay.

196
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:17,860
Okay.

197
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,771
Don't be mad at me, Bones.

198
00:10:21,777 --> 00:10:24,132
I didn't tell you to shut up.
It was a ploy.

199
00:10:24,445 --> 00:10:27,001
- Now he thinks you're an idiot.
- Game theory, Bones, okay?

200
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:30,523
For two players to gain advantage
over the one,

201
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:32,421
they must be distinct from each other.

202
00:10:32,427 --> 00:10:34,331
- Where'd you get that?
- From me.

203
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,590
I suggested that you be the smart one.

204
00:10:36,597 --> 00:10:39,053
Which, you know,
left me making a ploy that, uh,

205
00:10:39,857 --> 00:10:41,453
was supposed to be lame.

206
00:10:41,456 --> 00:10:43,153
- Don't enjoy this.
- What?

207
00:10:43,158 --> 00:10:44,950
The only reason I am playing his game is to

208
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:47,023
discover the identity of this young woman.

209
00:10:48,697 --> 00:10:50,720
And we've made no progress on that.

210
00:10:50,728 --> 00:10:53,151
Check the junior golf leagues.

211
00:10:53,158 --> 00:10:55,980
Given the amount of wear to
her shoulder, elbow and spine,

212
00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:58,282
she must have started
golfing at an early age.

213
00:10:58,585 --> 00:11:02,523
I found minute traces of gypsum
and selenium on the mystery wrist bone.

214
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:06,022
Also phenolphthalein,
which is a kind of laxative.

215
00:11:06,026 --> 00:11:08,131
Laxatives show up in bones?!

216
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:10,251
No. not even after years of ingestion.

217
00:11:10,256 --> 00:11:13,821
The laxative is on the surface of the bone.
I- I have no explanation.

218
00:11:13,827 --> 00:11:18,232
We have scoured every inch of her;
X-ray'd her, run her through an MRI...

219
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:20,461
What clue are we missing?

220
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:23,013
The laxative is the one thing
that makes no sense.

221
00:11:23,318 --> 00:11:27,000
Last time it was masturbation.
Did he reference bowel movements?

222
00:11:27,005 --> 00:11:31,291
He mentioned his mother was a germaphobe,
scrubbing his hands with ammoni...

223
00:11:32,306 --> 00:11:35,942
- Ammonia.
- Ammonia. Oh, why didn't you say so?

224
00:11:37,445 --> 00:11:38,711
Ammonia.

225
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:43,590
Booth thinks we should get
together and buy Brennan a pet.

226
00:11:43,598 --> 00:11:45,700
- What kind of a pet?
- A pig.

227
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,142
And I don't think he means a guinea pig.

228
00:11:47,147 --> 00:11:50,561
A real pig;
Like a mulefoot, saddleback or potbelly.

229
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:54,373
You want to expose a piece of crucial
evidence to ammonia gas? No.

230
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:58,412
Besides being a laxative, phenolphthalein
is a sensitive PH indicator.

231
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,450
Colorless, unless it's exposed to ammonia.

232
00:12:00,455 --> 00:12:02,530
The second you expose this bone,
it's useless.

233
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:04,180
Epps wants you
to destroy evidence.

234
00:12:04,185 --> 00:12:06,233
Why would he want us
to destroy evidence he planted?

235
00:12:06,236 --> 00:12:07,923
Why would he plant evidence at all?

236
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:10,410
It might be a win-win scenario for him.

237
00:12:10,518 --> 00:12:12,590
If his endgame is to disorient
Dr. Brennan,

238
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:16,381
he can do that by...
ruining evidence that he himself planted.

239
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:18,672
Fine. You can perform the experiment.

240
00:12:18,676 --> 00:12:20,913
So... glasses.

241
00:12:35,408 --> 00:12:38,111
- What is that?
- Not sure.

242
00:12:46,926 --> 00:12:48,853
Freemason symbol.

243
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,923
Hey, this explains
the buried face down thing.

244
00:12:53,536 --> 00:12:55,391
Ah, it's all starting to come together.

245
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,403
These crossed hammers prove that Epps is

246
00:12:57,405 --> 00:12:59,403
working for the top level
of the illuminati...

247
00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:01,892
That's the cartographic symbol for a mine.

248
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:05,050
Oh.

249
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:07,422
Epps is telling us that
the second victim's in a mine?

250
00:13:07,827 --> 00:13:09,043
What kind of mine?

251
00:13:09,048 --> 00:13:11,052
One that contains
gypsum and selenium.

252
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:15,782
In prison, Epps mentioned
a stone cross.

253
00:13:15,788 --> 00:13:18,293
That's what we should be
looking for inside.

254
00:13:19,705 --> 00:13:22,951
Okay, this is the
only abandoned gypsum mine

255
00:13:22,957 --> 00:13:25,931
within Epps' known killing ground
to also contain selenium.

256
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:29,111
Six entrances, hundreds of shafts,
and half of it's flooded.

257
00:13:29,316 --> 00:13:33,552
All right. You just follow my lead and
watch yourself in there, okay? Thank you.

258
00:13:33,558 --> 00:13:35,942
I don't think Epps would
make it that hard for us.

259
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:38,542
Epps said he wished he'd buried his mother
under a stone cross.

260
00:13:38,546 --> 00:13:40,030
I bet that is a hint.

261
00:13:40,037 --> 00:13:42,083
Okay, people, listen up.

262
00:13:42,086 --> 00:13:44,343
- I'm calling in a "splunking" team...
- Spelunking.

263
00:13:44,396 --> 00:13:48,263
Spelunking team with imaging capabilities
to look for a stone cross.

264
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:52,273
Till they get here, let's focus
on the ventilation shafts...

265
00:13:52,277 --> 00:13:54,433
Hold on--
To the west of the main shaft.

266
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:55,791
What?

267
00:13:56,928 --> 00:13:58,502
Oh. Never mind.

268
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:03,381
Can we get some light
down this shaft, please?

269
00:14:04,188 --> 00:14:06,870
- It's the cross, Booth.
- That is, uh...

270
00:14:06,878 --> 00:14:08,492
definitely a cross.

271
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:10,503
- Will you help me move these?
- Move what?

272
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,241
The rocks.

273
00:14:18,937 --> 00:14:20,232
B ones.

274
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,882
- Well, it's definitely human, but...
- What?

275
00:14:27,887 --> 00:14:29,630
Well, Cam can be more precise, but

276
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,533
I don't think this
is more than a week old.

277
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,590
Epps has been in prison
for seven years,

278
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:38,752
which means he has an accomplice
killing people, on the outside.

279
00:14:40,205 --> 00:14:42,591
And I wonder how many more there are.

280
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,171
This is where the hamate bone was taken.

281
00:14:48,577 --> 00:14:51,763
Victim is female,
mid-teens.

282
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,850
Extensive contusions
around the ankles.

283
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:56,531
Yes, and bone damage, too.

284
00:14:57,906 --> 00:14:59,642
Hip displacement,

285
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:01,962
elongation of the spine.

286
00:15:06,126 --> 00:15:07,891
He hung her upside down.

287
00:15:07,898 --> 00:15:10,882
I agree--
and while she was still alive, too.

288
00:15:10,888 --> 00:15:13,242
- Is that part of Epps's M.O.?
- No.

289
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,541
So his accomplice threw in
some flair of his own.

290
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:19,020
Nine years ago, Epps kills someone
and buries her.

291
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:20,963
He goes to jail seven years ago.

292
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:23,363
Last week, his accomplice
kills another girl

293
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:26,940
and swapped wrist bones with the girl
Epps buried nine years ago.

294
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:30,323
How do they communicate?

295
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:33,731
Inmates are allowed phone calls,
visitors, letters,

296
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:36,121
- but those are monitored.
- He has a wife.

297
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:37,811
Look at this.

298
00:15:37,815 --> 00:15:39,803
It's a burn--
Cigarette probably.

299
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,800
And there's this.

300
00:15:43,946 --> 00:15:45,732
It was jammed in her shoe.

301
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:48,161
She wasn't wearing it?

302
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:53,571
The...
mine victim's dental work

303
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,880
identifies her as Sarah Koskoff,

304
00:15:55,986 --> 00:15:57,602
Bethesda, Maryland.

305
00:15:57,606 --> 00:16:00,670
Disappeared three weeks ago.
16 years old.

306
00:16:00,677 --> 00:16:02,371
Sarah Koskoff...

307
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,102
She fits Epps'
victim profile perfectly.

308
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:13,881
- Brennan.
- Yeah, Bones, it's me.

309
00:16:13,886 --> 00:16:15,903
Listen, I talked to Sarah
Koskoff's parents.

310
00:16:15,905 --> 00:16:18,243
They said her dream was
to own her own beauty shop.

311
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:21,680
- She worked for a hair salon in the city.
- Don't tell me.

312
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:25,140
Yep, M Salon, Cleveland park,
owned by Caroline Mapother.

313
00:16:25,147 --> 00:16:27,082
Now known as Caroline Epps?

314
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:29,830
You know, you remember when I
was nice to her and you weren't?

315
00:16:30,137 --> 00:16:31,523
This is why.

316
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,413
Thank you.

317
00:16:35,705 --> 00:16:36,861
Hi.

318
00:16:38,435 --> 00:16:39,570
Hi.

319
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:41,783
I-i-i-is Howard okay?

320
00:16:41,788 --> 00:16:44,832
Howard's fine, Mrs. Epps.
You don't have to worry about anything.

321
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:48,121
I couldn't help but notice
the "help wanted" sign in the window.

322
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:50,312
Did you recently lose
one of your employees?

323
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:52,260
It's, uh...

324
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:55,920
Hard to keep help
that doesn't steal from you.

325
00:16:56,328 --> 00:16:58,070
Sarah Koskoff steal from you?

326
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:01,743
No...
Why?

327
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:05,501
- What did she do?
- She died.

328
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:09,970
I'm afraid I have to ask you,

329
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:13,153
but when was the last time
you saw her?

330
00:17:14,157 --> 00:17:17,651
Three weeks ago.
She just stopped coming to work.

331
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,791
Sh-she died?

332
00:17:19,795 --> 00:17:23,370
Did you ever, uh...
Talk to Howard about her?

333
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,951
I don't know. Maybe.

334
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:27,330
Howard ever see
a picture of Sarah?

335
00:17:27,336 --> 00:17:29,490
I-i don't like this.
What's going on?

336
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:31,200
She was found buried,

337
00:17:31,905 --> 00:17:34,160
face down,
in an abandoned mine.

338
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:38,181
The back of her head bashed in,
wrists, ankles tied.

339
00:17:38,987 --> 00:17:40,733
Your husband's M.O.

340
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,800
Poor Sarah.

341
00:17:46,946 --> 00:17:48,721
But Howard...

342
00:17:49,428 --> 00:17:53,262
Howard has been in prison
for the last seven years.

343
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:55,493
How could he kill anyone?

344
00:17:56,265 --> 00:17:57,981
He has an accomplice.

345
00:17:58,986 --> 00:18:01,691
- You think it's me?
- You love your husband.

346
00:18:01,698 --> 00:18:03,990
I love the good in Howard.

347
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:06,563
I reject the evil.

348
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,751
We're going to have
a child together.

349
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:12,383
I've petitioned the court
to let Howard donate.

350
00:18:12,387 --> 00:18:13,781
Yeah...

351
00:18:14,298 --> 00:18:18,111
I have a search warrant here,
for your home and your shop.

352
00:18:18,128 --> 00:18:20,630
You don't need a search warrant.

353
00:18:20,637 --> 00:18:22,410
You can look anywhere you want

354
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,523
because you won't find anything.

355
00:18:29,056 --> 00:18:33,620
Sarah Koskoff was hung upside down
before she was killed.

356
00:18:34,298 --> 00:18:36,013
That suggests a torture room.

357
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:41,173
I was hoping... it was in the basement
of the beauty salon,

358
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:43,620
but my agents, they didn't find anything.

359
00:18:44,428 --> 00:18:46,631
- What's that?
- A religious medal...

360
00:18:47,438 --> 00:18:49,171
Sarah had in her possession.

361
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:53,251
St. Agnes, patron saint of young women.

362
00:18:54,585 --> 00:18:56,650
Especially those who remain pure.

363
00:18:57,556 --> 00:19:00,520
- How do you know all that?
- I'm catholic, Bones.

364
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:05,621
- "sahs."
- Yeah, St. Agnes high school.

365
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,640
Except...

366
00:19:08,657 --> 00:19:12,410
Sarah Koskoff went to public school--
Oh, God.

367
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:14,710
What? What does it mean?

368
00:19:15,017 --> 00:19:17,383
It means I have to go talk to a nun.

369
00:19:18,235 --> 00:19:21,781
We have no student
at St. Agnes named Sarah Koskoff.

370
00:19:22,186 --> 00:19:24,973
Maybe she's a friend
of one of your girls?

371
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:27,911
As soon as you called me last night,

372
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,970
we implemented a telephone tree,
asking precisely that question.

373
00:19:31,976 --> 00:19:32,943
No response.

374
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:37,753
Do the names Howard Epps, Caroline Epps,
Caroline Mapother mean anything to you?

375
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:40,362
May I have the keyboard?

376
00:19:40,368 --> 00:19:42,832
Yes, sister, yeah,
of course, here.

377
00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:48,181
I need to enter a password.

378
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:50,742
Oh, yeah.
I'll be right over here.

379
00:19:52,046 --> 00:19:55,662
I'm catholic.
I go to mass every Sunday.

380
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:59,203
Almost every Sunday.
I'm very trustworthy.

381
00:20:00,915 --> 00:20:02,773
Nobody by any of those names.

382
00:20:03,277 --> 00:20:05,331
I feel that I have been...

383
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:08,383
very patient in regard to not asking...

384
00:20:08,388 --> 00:20:10,212
what this is about.

385
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,811
Oh...

386
00:20:11,816 --> 00:20:13,602
a murder victim.

387
00:20:13,618 --> 00:20:16,862
A young girl was found
with this religious medal.

388
00:20:23,617 --> 00:20:26,432
- Helen Majors.
- Helen Majors?

389
00:20:26,636 --> 00:20:27,883
Who is that?

390
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:30,092
This golden medal

391
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,461
is given to the holy spirit award
winner every year.

392
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:37,270
I presented this medal
to Helen Majors myself.

393
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:41,671
May we please see Helen Majors?
Talk to her?

394
00:20:41,778 --> 00:20:46,441
Helen left school three days ago.
No one has seen her since.

395
00:20:48,987 --> 00:20:51,530
Three days ago, Helen had that medal.

396
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:54,662
Yesterday, we found it
with Sarah Koskoff's dead body.

397
00:20:54,668 --> 00:20:56,552
It's possible Helen is still alive.

398
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,811
We have Caroline Epps
under surveillance.

399
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:00,712
I hate this.

400
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:02,342
Booth.

401
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:05,590
I don't want to find that girl's remains
in some mine, Booth.

402
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,161
Reiner Hatin?

403
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:11,440
Address. 7408 Haskell Street,
Cleveland Park.

404
00:21:12,717 --> 00:21:15,181
22705 to control,
I'm en route to a possible

405
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:19,270
HRT incident at 7408 Haskell Street;
requesting backup.

406
00:21:19,377 --> 00:21:22,511
Affirmative, 22705;
7408 Haskell.

407
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,512
- What?
- Epps's prison letter logs

408
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:27,112
show in the last year,
he wrote six letters

409
00:21:27,116 --> 00:21:29,702
to a man by the name of
Reiner Hatin at that address.

410
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:32,381
Caroline Epps might not be
Epps's accomplice after all.

411
00:21:32,686 --> 00:21:34,563
- What are you doing?
- Where's the siren on this thing?

412
00:21:34,767 --> 00:21:36,363
Don't touch.

413
00:21:44,146 --> 00:21:46,252
Okay, Bones, I'm going in,
you're going to wait outside.

414
00:21:46,258 --> 00:21:47,810
- Booth...
- No, I don't want to hear it, all right?

415
00:21:47,818 --> 00:21:50,472
When backup arrives,
tell them there's a federal agent inside.

416
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,992
Which one is it?

417
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,403
Great, vacant lot.

418
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,733
I tried to tell you.

419
00:22:05,178 --> 00:22:06,512
Did you hear?

420
00:22:06,715 --> 00:22:08,382
I'm going to be a father.

421
00:22:08,388 --> 00:22:11,502
The judge granted our petition
for artificial insemination.

422
00:22:13,046 --> 00:22:15,062
When I make my donation
to the baby bank,

423
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,313
I'm going to be thinking about you.

424
00:22:18,415 --> 00:22:20,023
Who is Reiner Hatin?

425
00:22:20,026 --> 00:22:21,620
Ah, Reiner.

426
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,703
"Alter freund mit hnlichen geschmack."

427
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:27,270
The letters were addressed
to a vacant lot.

428
00:22:27,288 --> 00:22:29,101
I must have written
the address down wrong.

429
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:31,681
I'm slightly dyslexic, you know.

430
00:22:32,088 --> 00:22:35,781
Hey, come here. You know,
I really enjoyed playing your game,

431
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:38,780
but now, you know what?
There is a girl out there,

432
00:22:38,787 --> 00:22:41,730
hanging upside down
with duct tape over her mouth.

433
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:44,472
Booth, let him go.
Let him go.

434
00:22:50,738 --> 00:22:53,172
For all your faults, Mr. Epps,

435
00:22:53,176 --> 00:22:56,352
you were never interested
in letting your victims suffer.

436
00:22:56,355 --> 00:22:59,772
You didn't torture them.
You're not that kind of man.

437
00:23:02,136 --> 00:23:04,143
She's an innocent child.

438
00:23:05,037 --> 00:23:07,153
She's a young woman.

439
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:10,940
And there's no such thing
as an innocent woman.

440
00:23:12,796 --> 00:23:16,312
Look within yourself.
You know I'm right.

441
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,812
You know, I'm just guessing here,
you understand,

442
00:23:18,818 --> 00:23:22,831
but I think you'll find that Helen Majors
has less than 24 hours to live.

443
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,902
Better get going.

444
00:23:35,236 --> 00:23:36,702
Sorry.

445
00:23:47,517 --> 00:23:48,681
What are you asking me for?

446
00:23:48,686 --> 00:23:51,223
You said you've dealt
with manipulative men before.

447
00:23:51,228 --> 00:23:53,660
Sweetie, this is a psycho killer,

448
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:57,471
not some loser who wants you
to cosign a loan for his jet ski.

449
00:23:58,016 --> 00:24:02,202
Epps is pushing me around, Ange.
He's in control; I hate that.

450
00:24:02,828 --> 00:24:04,613
You know...

451
00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:08,141
Epps is acting kind of like a boyfriend.

452
00:24:09,777 --> 00:24:12,481
- What?!
- Well, you obviously fascinate him.

453
00:24:13,228 --> 00:24:15,851
He can't have you
and he can't kill you,

454
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:18,351
so, he wants to make
you hate yourself.

455
00:24:18,355 --> 00:24:22,262
God, Ange, what kind of boyfriends
have you had?

456
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:24,091
Let's keep the focus
on you and Epps, okay?

457
00:24:25,315 --> 00:24:26,481
Okay.

458
00:24:26,485 --> 00:24:28,480
Epps knows that you'll never
forgive yourself if

459
00:24:28,487 --> 00:24:31,192
you don't find Helen Majors
before she's murdered.

460
00:24:31,495 --> 00:24:33,762
Not only is Helen
being tortured, but...

461
00:24:35,156 --> 00:24:37,250
Her family must be in agony.

462
00:24:37,955 --> 00:24:39,703
You see?

463
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:41,543
This is what he's doing.

464
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:43,651
He's putting pictures in your mind.

465
00:24:43,658 --> 00:24:45,772
He's... messing with your objectivity.

466
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,790
There's nothing I can do about that.

467
00:24:47,998 --> 00:24:50,050
You have to step back, okay?

468
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:52,452
Let the rest of us deal
with the families.

469
00:24:53,428 --> 00:24:56,631
You find Helen.
That'll keep Epps from...

470
00:24:56,948 --> 00:24:58,990
Getting a jet ski out of you.

471
00:25:03,316 --> 00:25:05,903
Bones, Caroline Epps;
Not an accomplice.

472
00:25:05,906 --> 00:25:08,222
She was at work when Helen
Majors was kidnapped.

473
00:25:08,225 --> 00:25:11,382
"Alter freund mit hnlichen geschmack."

474
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:12,960
Yeah, whatever.

475
00:25:12,966 --> 00:25:16,621
It means "old friend with similar tastes"
in German.

476
00:25:16,925 --> 00:25:19,641
I don't know, Epps telling us the name
of his accomplice? That's too easy.

477
00:25:19,647 --> 00:25:22,030
Well, if it's too easy,
then why can't we find him?

478
00:25:22,037 --> 00:25:25,103
You know what?
He talked about impregnating Caroline.

479
00:25:25,116 --> 00:25:26,791
Ugh! What is with Caroline Epps?

480
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:30,102
I mean, why have a child
with a monster like him?

481
00:25:30,106 --> 00:25:32,413
What's she going to tell
the child when it grows up?

482
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:34,412
- "Hi, your daddy's a monster."
- W-wait, look, time out.

483
00:25:34,415 --> 00:25:36,840
You got to detach from this, all right?
We let Epps get under our skin--

484
00:25:36,846 --> 00:25:38,200
It's exactly what he wants.

485
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:39,951
Zack was right;
Epps is trying to break us.

486
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:43,921
Not only did we save his life,
but he is still killing.

487
00:25:43,927 --> 00:25:45,721
I found traces of ethylene oxide

488
00:25:45,725 --> 00:25:48,520
and high levels of an antibacterial agent
on Sarah's ankles.

489
00:25:48,526 --> 00:25:51,823
Also, polymer residue found
in polygenex latex glove liners.

490
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:53,611
Used by people
who handle toxic substances.

491
00:25:53,617 --> 00:25:56,130
- Airport screeners, cops...
- Wait-- prison guards?

492
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:59,931
Lauren Hathaway was a nationally ranked
junior golfer in 1997.

493
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:01,930
Yeah, it's Booth.
I need to know if Howard Epps ever had

494
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,411
a prison guard by the name of Reiner Hatin.

495
00:26:03,418 --> 00:26:05,011
She disappeared on May 9,

496
00:26:05,015 --> 00:26:08,383
after leaving the Southampton Country Club
in Raleigh, North Carolina.

497
00:26:08,387 --> 00:26:10,872
Check and see
if any guard changed his name.

498
00:26:10,878 --> 00:26:14,702
"Reiner" is German for "pure."
Epps has a thing about that.

499
00:26:14,718 --> 00:26:18,333
Translate the name and see if that comes
back in any form, then you get back to me.

500
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,042
It's the victim from the park?

501
00:26:20,047 --> 00:26:21,993
Her father is in your office.

502
00:26:22,008 --> 00:26:24,002
- What?!
- Why didn't you say that?

503
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:25,872
Uh, uh, you were on the phone.

504
00:26:25,978 --> 00:26:27,322
Booth...

505
00:26:28,715 --> 00:26:31,962
I can't do this one.
Maybe Angela can help.

506
00:26:34,618 --> 00:26:36,582
All right, I'll take care of it.

507
00:26:39,925 --> 00:26:42,921
My wife died five years
after Lauren disappeared,

508
00:26:43,905 --> 00:26:46,632
I think, because she just gave up hope.

509
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:51,162
Part of me is glad
she's not here today for this.

510
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:54,091
We're sorry for your loss,
Mr. Hathaway.

511
00:26:55,295 --> 00:26:56,882
For both your losses.

512
00:26:56,886 --> 00:27:00,831
When Lauren disappeared, the police
originally suspected her golf coach.

513
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:04,690
Yes, he'd had an affair with
one of his students the year before.

514
00:27:04,897 --> 00:27:07,911
Ironically, his alibi was that
he was with another student.

515
00:27:07,915 --> 00:27:11,383
Does the name Reiner Hatin...
mean anything to you?

516
00:27:11,686 --> 00:27:12,681
No.

517
00:27:12,687 --> 00:27:14,493
Do you recognize this man?

518
00:27:17,926 --> 00:27:18,922
No.

519
00:27:19,778 --> 00:27:22,672
- I'm not helping, am I?
- That photograph is current.

520
00:27:22,778 --> 00:27:27,150
Here are some drawings that show what
he might have looked like ten years ago.

521
00:27:36,525 --> 00:27:38,430
Yes, that one.

522
00:27:38,738 --> 00:27:42,900
He was a greenskeeper at the club.
He helped us load the car one day.

523
00:27:43,618 --> 00:27:46,313
I remember because he told Lauren
she looked just like his mother

524
00:27:46,317 --> 00:27:49,012
when she was young.
It was an odd thing to say.

525
00:27:49,415 --> 00:27:53,082
I told the police about it when she
disappeared. Why didn't they arrest him?

526
00:28:00,157 --> 00:28:03,730
Caroline Epps; She knows something.
She just won't talk to me.

527
00:28:03,736 --> 00:28:06,350
- Why?
- I'm a man, last time I checked.

528
00:28:06,657 --> 00:28:08,941
- But she'll talk to a woman?
- That's my thinking.

529
00:28:08,947 --> 00:28:10,040
- Fine, I'll do it.
- Oh, no,

530
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:12,651
you can't sarcasm it out of her.
You have to connect.

531
00:28:12,655 --> 00:28:14,711
- You don't want to send Brennan?
- No. Angela.

532
00:28:15,425 --> 00:28:18,101
Angela is an artist,
an expert in 3-d reconstruction.

533
00:28:18,105 --> 00:28:21,113
Well, unlike you and Bones,
Angela is, uh...

534
00:28:21,517 --> 00:28:22,362
What?

535
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,330
She's better with the living
than she is the dead.

536
00:28:24,635 --> 00:28:27,421
Fine, I'll go tell her what
she's just volunteered for.

537
00:28:27,426 --> 00:28:28,822
Thank you.

538
00:28:31,805 --> 00:28:33,110
Thanks for coming.

539
00:28:33,817 --> 00:28:36,232
I-I've told you people everything I know.

540
00:28:36,847 --> 00:28:38,802
I-I don't see the point of this.

541
00:28:38,906 --> 00:28:40,633
I know this is disturbing.

542
00:28:41,235 --> 00:28:43,313
I find it very upsetting and I'm...

543
00:28:43,975 --> 00:28:45,810
not married to the man who did it.

544
00:28:46,027 --> 00:28:48,283
I love Howard, Ms. Montenegro.

545
00:28:49,008 --> 00:28:50,483
I believe you.

546
00:28:51,445 --> 00:28:53,290
No one has ever said that to me.

547
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,550
I think you'd have
to love him very much...

548
00:28:55,757 --> 00:28:57,562
to be willing to overlook what he's done.

549
00:28:57,768 --> 00:28:59,580
Done in the past.

550
00:28:59,586 --> 00:29:01,201
The thing is...

551
00:29:01,905 --> 00:29:05,071
We're not so sure
that it was in the past.

552
00:29:06,255 --> 00:29:09,093
For Howard,
it's obvious what he likes.

553
00:29:09,896 --> 00:29:13,362
- Blonde girls.
- Not me, you mean.

554
00:29:13,368 --> 00:29:16,842
Men can't hide what they like.
For Howard, it's this.

555
00:29:17,245 --> 00:29:20,703
Men can change...
what they look at.

556
00:29:21,106 --> 00:29:22,901
Does Howard ever just look at you?

557
00:29:23,105 --> 00:29:25,650
So you just feel his eyes adoring you?

558
00:29:29,035 --> 00:29:30,360
He...

559
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:32,512
he asks for...

560
00:29:32,516 --> 00:29:35,902
magazines, DVDs.
He's...

561
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:37,903
he's very specific.

562
00:29:38,765 --> 00:29:40,480
He likes blonde girls.

563
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:43,852
Always the blonde girls.

564
00:29:47,847 --> 00:29:50,671
M-maybe if I--
if I dyed my hair...

565
00:29:52,617 --> 00:29:55,452
I'm sorry;
I have to ask you something.

566
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:59,950
Have you ever delivered
any messages for Howard?

567
00:30:00,955 --> 00:30:02,840
"Don't you miss them?"

568
00:30:02,855 --> 00:30:04,501
I'm sorry?

569
00:30:05,206 --> 00:30:07,301
I wrote the message

570
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:12,650
"Don't you miss them?" on a piece of paper
and slipped it into a mailbox.

571
00:30:13,157 --> 00:30:14,680
Whose mailbox?

572
00:30:16,487 --> 00:30:20,313
A man named Henry Gerber,
who Howard knew from prison.

573
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:24,381
Howard calls Henry
"The mad German."

574
00:30:24,785 --> 00:30:26,720
When did you deliver the message?

575
00:30:28,948 --> 00:30:30,900
F... five days ago.

576
00:30:31,805 --> 00:30:33,443
Thank you.

577
00:30:34,408 --> 00:30:35,960
Can-can...

578
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,873
Will you sit with me
just a moment longer?

579
00:30:41,097 --> 00:30:44,953
I'm... I have to make a phone call,
you understand?

580
00:30:45,355 --> 00:30:49,761
But after that, I'll sit with you...
as long as you like.

581
00:31:00,405 --> 00:31:02,130
FBI, hands in the air.

582
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,811
That's it;
now move over there slowly.

583
00:31:04,816 --> 00:31:06,721
Ah! keep your hands
where I can see them.

584
00:31:06,725 --> 00:31:08,182
I can't do both.

585
00:31:08,188 --> 00:31:09,783
Booth.

586
00:31:11,545 --> 00:31:12,812
Easy.

587
00:31:18,035 --> 00:31:21,353
- Where's Henry Gerber?
- I'm Henry Gerber.

588
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:28,321
There is no way a man in a wheelchair

589
00:31:28,325 --> 00:31:30,360
could have killed Sarah Koskoff

590
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:34,122
or swapped hamate bones
with Lauren Hathaway.

591
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:37,341
All right, Epps got us again, huh?
Gerber is paralyzed from the waist down

592
00:31:37,348 --> 00:31:41,470
because Epps knifed him
just before he was paroled.

593
00:31:41,478 --> 00:31:43,660
So, what, his message
"Don't you miss them?"

594
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:45,540
meant what, his legs?

595
00:31:45,555 --> 00:31:49,042
Epps is good.
Not morally, of course,

596
00:31:49,046 --> 00:31:51,553
but it's a classic feint
and parry misdirect.

597
00:31:51,557 --> 00:31:53,363
Delivered via his wife.

598
00:31:53,366 --> 00:31:55,673
He gets off on screwing
with people's lives.

599
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:57,970
- Where are we on Reiner Hatin?
- Nowhere.

600
00:31:57,976 --> 00:31:59,660
I had some thoughts.

601
00:31:59,965 --> 00:32:02,883
Perhaps the point isn't that
German is a different language,

602
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:05,133
but that it's actually
a different language.

603
00:32:05,136 --> 00:32:07,421
Great, thanks, Zack,
for being so helpful.

604
00:32:07,437 --> 00:32:09,783
- Go on.
- More broadly speaking, I mean,

605
00:32:09,787 --> 00:32:13,473
like an anagram
or an inner or secret language.

606
00:32:13,775 --> 00:32:16,903
These are phrases I've found in English.
Perhaps in German...

607
00:32:16,908 --> 00:32:19,490
No, the whole German thing was a ruse.
If it's anywhere, it's here.

608
00:32:19,495 --> 00:32:23,532
"Rant herein I."
You know, like inner schizophrenic voices.

609
00:32:23,535 --> 00:32:25,790
"Are inner hit"
Could mean...

610
00:32:25,998 --> 00:32:28,020
I don't really do the poetry thing.

611
00:32:28,027 --> 00:32:29,320
Neither rain, no, neither..

612
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:32,612
Neither rain nor sleet
nor dead of night...

613
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,213
The postal service motto.

614
00:32:34,216 --> 00:32:36,121
Hey, the guy's all about
sending messages.

615
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:38,642
Mail to an empty lot,
messages dropped in mail slots.

616
00:32:38,745 --> 00:32:41,342
Postal workers wear polygenex gloves.

617
00:32:41,648 --> 00:32:45,170
Who received the letters
Epps sent to that empty lot?

618
00:32:46,908 --> 00:32:48,593
Letters with an invalid address and no

619
00:32:48,595 --> 00:32:50,473
return address go to
the dead letter office.

620
00:32:50,485 --> 00:32:51,601
Who has access?

621
00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:54,161
The sorting staff and the
mail carrier for that route.

622
00:32:54,165 --> 00:32:59,093
Stream us the route which includes
7408 Haskell Street, Cleveland Park, right?

623
00:32:59,098 --> 00:33:01,963
Yes, but there is
no 7408 Haskell Street.

624
00:33:02,778 --> 00:33:04,120
Got it.

625
00:33:05,886 --> 00:33:09,123
There-- that's Caroline Epps's
beauty salon.

626
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:11,191
It's St. Agnes high school.

627
00:33:11,195 --> 00:33:13,813
The killer picked his victims
from a postal route.

628
00:33:13,816 --> 00:33:16,411
- Tell us the name of the mail carrier.
- I can do better than that.

629
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:18,452
All I ask is that
when this goes to the press,

630
00:33:18,466 --> 00:33:20,623
nobody uses the word
"Disgruntled."

631
00:33:22,286 --> 00:33:24,601
I'm so sorry.
He's never done anything like this.

632
00:33:24,615 --> 00:33:26,940
- Booth...
- Yeah, I got it.

633
00:33:27,448 --> 00:33:30,250
- What?
- That's the guy who found the first body.

634
00:33:30,255 --> 00:33:33,000
Found it because he knew where
it was buried. Let's go.

635
00:33:39,168 --> 00:33:41,820
Oh, great, him again.
I'll need a pine cone.

636
00:33:41,825 --> 00:33:45,040
Listen, dog, I will shoot you in the head
if you don't cut it out right now!

637
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:49,762
Oh.

638
00:33:56,318 --> 00:33:57,562
God.

639
00:33:59,035 --> 00:34:01,502
I hate the serial killer
wall of death.

640
00:34:03,365 --> 00:34:05,092
This is Sarah Koskoff.

641
00:34:06,596 --> 00:34:07,991
Helen Majors.

642
00:34:08,096 --> 00:34:11,693
They were all so young,
so innocent.

643
00:34:12,815 --> 00:34:14,303
Lauren Hathaway.

644
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:18,350
Southampton Country Club;
That's where Epps and his accomplice met.

645
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,603
Lappin maintained the golf carts.

646
00:34:20,608 --> 00:34:24,121
He's winning, Bones, all right? We're
this close to saving Helen Majors' life.

647
00:34:24,738 --> 00:34:25,783
Running out of time.

648
00:34:25,785 --> 00:34:27,740
- Yeah?
- Hodgins, it's me.

649
00:34:27,746 --> 00:34:29,950
Is there anything you can tell
us about where Sarah Koskoff

650
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:32,243
was held before her body
was dumped in the gypsum mine?

651
00:34:32,247 --> 00:34:35,583
The only substance I can't
explain is ethylene oxide.

652
00:34:35,587 --> 00:34:39,700
What about the ethylene oxide plus...
the antibacterial agents?

653
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:41,800
It c-could be a lot of things.

654
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:45,453
I'll set up a statistical model,
give you four or five scenarios.

655
00:34:45,456 --> 00:34:48,561
There is no time.
A girl's life is at stake here.

656
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:50,550
Just give me your best guess, right now.

657
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:53,191
I can't just guess.
I have a process!

658
00:34:55,548 --> 00:34:57,571
What if I guess and the girl dies?

659
00:34:57,776 --> 00:34:59,121
No. no way.

660
00:34:59,127 --> 00:35:00,821
All right, just simmer down, Hodgins.

661
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:04,253
We're all just trying to do our best
in this situation right now.

662
00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:05,532
Jack...

663
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:07,372
Hodgins, are you still there?

664
00:35:08,176 --> 00:35:11,220
Hey. Pretend it's me asking. Okay?

665
00:35:11,665 --> 00:35:14,900
Look, we're just exchanging theories
here at work, like always.

666
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:17,280
Two substances. Right?

667
00:35:17,486 --> 00:35:19,213
Put them in the same
place at the same time.

668
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,871
Either they mean something or they don't.

669
00:35:20,877 --> 00:35:22,622
Hodgins, you there, buddy?

670
00:35:23,027 --> 00:35:26,120
- Yeah, just give me a second, please!
- We don't have a second!

671
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:29,312
Booth, do you think you could
just stop talking, please?

672
00:35:32,215 --> 00:35:34,131
Okay, all right, uh...

673
00:35:34,137 --> 00:35:37,932
antibacterial agents, and, uh,
he-he's a postal worker.

674
00:35:37,938 --> 00:35:39,331
Okay.

675
00:35:40,277 --> 00:35:41,850
What else, Jack?

676
00:35:44,455 --> 00:35:46,743
- Anthrax.
- Anthrax?

677
00:35:46,746 --> 00:35:49,412
After the anthrax attacks in 2001,

678
00:35:49,415 --> 00:35:52,152
the post office shut down
several sorting centers.

679
00:35:52,157 --> 00:35:53,451
Okay. All right.

680
00:35:53,555 --> 00:35:54,750
Tell me.

681
00:35:54,757 --> 00:35:58,890
Uh, they used ethylene oxide
and this antibacterial agent.

682
00:35:59,597 --> 00:36:01,850
That's how they cleaned them.
Not all of them reopened.

683
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:05,660
So it's possible Sarah was kept
at an abandoned sorting center?

684
00:36:05,968 --> 00:36:07,161
Yes.

685
00:36:08,745 --> 00:36:09,941
Yes, it is.

686
00:36:09,945 --> 00:36:12,063
I knew you'd come through
for me, buddy. Good work.

687
00:36:28,325 --> 00:36:29,712
All right.

688
00:36:31,126 --> 00:36:33,312
- Here.
- I didn't even have to ask.

689
00:36:33,617 --> 00:36:35,692
Yeah, well, just be careful, all right?

690
00:36:36,297 --> 00:36:40,051
Don't shoot me, don't shoot Helen Majors,
otherwise...

691
00:36:58,517 --> 00:37:00,363
Please.

692
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:03,312
Please.

693
00:37:04,337 --> 00:37:05,253
Helen...

694
00:37:05,258 --> 00:37:07,031
Please...
please help me.

695
00:37:07,038 --> 00:37:08,732
Oh, God.
All right, easy.

696
00:37:08,746 --> 00:37:09,742
Please help me.

697
00:37:09,748 --> 00:37:11,843
I got you.
I got you, all right?

698
00:37:11,845 --> 00:37:14,551
- Where is he?
- He just left. I don't know where he went.

699
00:37:14,555 --> 00:37:17,550
Bones, stay here, with her.
Stay right there.

700
00:37:18,556 --> 00:37:21,720
Don't leave me.
Please don't leave me.

701
00:37:54,058 --> 00:37:55,901
Is he dead?

702
00:37:57,766 --> 00:37:59,203
Yeah, he's dead...

703
00:38:08,138 --> 00:38:10,071
I had to shoot him.

704
00:38:10,077 --> 00:38:12,833
Yeah.
I'm glad you did.

705
00:38:23,137 --> 00:38:24,852
Well done.

706
00:38:26,425 --> 00:38:27,703
Really.

707
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:31,411
- Game's over, Howie.
- Yes. I won.

708
00:38:31,415 --> 00:38:33,810
Only if you wanted
your accomplice dead.

709
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:36,853
- Lappin's dead?
- Shot resisting arrest.

710
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:38,243
Who shot him?

711
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:42,901
It was you, wasn't it?

712
00:38:45,045 --> 00:38:48,700
You shot him?
Did he take long to die?

713
00:38:51,146 --> 00:38:52,473
Did he suffer?

714
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,630
This is better than I hoped.
I thought it would be you.

715
00:38:58,806 --> 00:39:01,692
How did it feel?
Dirty, yes?

716
00:39:02,195 --> 00:39:03,662
But there's also a rush.

717
00:39:04,986 --> 00:39:06,280
Pleasure.

718
00:39:07,196 --> 00:39:08,631
Part of you liked it.

719
00:39:10,905 --> 00:39:14,110
This whole game
was to have us kill someone?

720
00:39:14,845 --> 00:39:16,883
Who's going to tell Lappin's mom?

721
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,740
She loves him very much, you know.

722
00:39:20,547 --> 00:39:23,811
Without her son, she'll be
completely alone in this sad world.

723
00:39:26,788 --> 00:39:29,731
We're done with you.
You're never gonna see us again. Come on.

724
00:39:32,856 --> 00:39:35,350
I'm pretty sure you're wrong
about that, Agent Booth.

725
00:39:53,485 --> 00:39:55,132
Vodka?

726
00:39:56,686 --> 00:40:00,921
It's water.
But it's... on the rocks.

727
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:04,821
You know, Bones, I'm not sure
you've grasped the basic theory,

728
00:40:04,826 --> 00:40:06,762
you know, of getting drunk.

729
00:40:06,966 --> 00:40:08,092
Hey.

730
00:40:09,357 --> 00:40:13,020
What you need to do is
order a shot of hard liquor

731
00:40:14,228 --> 00:40:16,661
from a bartender named Shakey

732
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:20,962
and tell him to leave
the bottle on the bar.

733
00:40:21,967 --> 00:40:24,032
I'm fine, Booth.

734
00:40:25,445 --> 00:40:27,713
I'm sitting here,
thinking about it and...

735
00:40:29,088 --> 00:40:30,463
I'm fine.

736
00:40:32,398 --> 00:40:33,721
Okay.

737
00:40:34,626 --> 00:40:37,810
What I'm getting from you here,
Bones, is that you're fine.

738
00:40:43,646 --> 00:40:45,230
He murdered Sarah.

739
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:47,201
He was about to murder Helen.

740
00:40:47,206 --> 00:40:51,171
Why should I feel upset
about shooting him?

741
00:40:51,178 --> 00:40:53,852
You know, I mean, if I was going
to be upset, which I'm not,

742
00:40:53,858 --> 00:40:56,590
it would be because
Epps thinks he beat us, so...

743
00:40:57,608 --> 00:40:59,383
- He didn't.
- I know.

744
00:40:59,386 --> 00:41:01,701
You're upset because
you think he beat us.

745
00:41:03,436 --> 00:41:04,950
And you know what?

746
00:41:06,436 --> 00:41:07,830
He did.

747
00:41:09,727 --> 00:41:11,712
- Beat us?
- Yeah.

748
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:14,901
- You just said that he didn't.
- Well, I changed my mind.

749
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:16,732
What, in the last three seconds?

750
00:41:16,738 --> 00:41:19,640
You know, you're afraid
that Epps turned you into him,

751
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:21,942
into a killer.

752
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:26,441
You have to come to grips with the fact
that you killed another human being.

753
00:41:28,276 --> 00:41:30,311
Because when you kill someone...

754
00:41:30,468 --> 00:41:32,353
You know, there's a cost.

755
00:41:34,037 --> 00:41:35,702
A steep cost.

756
00:41:37,415 --> 00:41:39,520
I know; I've done it.

757
00:41:42,036 --> 00:41:45,530
- I did the right thing.
- I know.

758
00:41:49,288 --> 00:41:50,910
I was there.

759
00:41:58,267 --> 00:42:02,261
- Look what I did.
- It doesn't matter.

760
00:42:02,868 --> 00:42:04,841
It does. It matters.

761
00:42:08,705 --> 00:42:10,471
Got something for you.

762
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:15,151
- A bottle of hard liquor?
- The next best thing.

763
00:42:19,135 --> 00:42:20,430
Hmm?

764
00:42:22,045 --> 00:42:25,031
Meet... Jasper.

765
00:42:37,686 --> 00:42:39,672
You're going to be okay.

766
00:42:41,596 --> 00:42:44,611
- Yeah?
- Definitely.
