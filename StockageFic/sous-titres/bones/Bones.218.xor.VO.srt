1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,000
So, you ever
been here before?

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,300
No.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,400
Oh, I don't mean <i>here</i>
here. I mean Baltimore.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,200
Yeah, I've given
several lectures

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,900
to the Baltimore
Homicide Division.

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,700
What's wrong
with your mouth?

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,100
I got a tooth situation.
Well, go to
a dentist.

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,100
All right, I will
if it doesn't get any better.

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,200
Ow! Man!
Are you afraid
of the dentist?

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,600
I'm not afraid.
Welcome to Balmer.

11
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,900
This is, uh, actually a federal
flood abatement project,

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,200
which is why
we called you.

13
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,800
K-9 unit was using
it for an exercise,

14
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,600
and one of the
cadaver dogs
went berserk.

15
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,300
When they dug
up the cement...

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No, that's concrete.

17
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,100
Cement is an ingredient in concrete.

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,800
Yeah, that's a real
important distinction to make

19
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,900
at this juncture.

20
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,900
So, what do we got,
Bones, huh?

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,800
Do your thing.

22
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,100
Nothing.

23
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,300
Nothing. Nothing?
No, I can't
see enough

24
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,000
of the skull, the tibia,
the pubis.

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,900
Nothing.
Nothing.
Wait a second. Nothing.

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,799
Oh, sorry about that.

27
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,700
We drove all the way here so
you could just tell me nothing?

28
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,800
All right, so what do you,
what do you want to, uh,

29
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,400
get the whole slab
of cement...
Concrete.

30
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,800
...concrete, whatever-- shipped
back to the Jeffersonian?

31
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,600
Abso ???

32
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
Sex?

33
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,800
The mandible
suggests male,

34
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,900
and the tibia
suggests

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,200
he was between five
six and six feet tall.

36
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,600
Waffle-soled training shoes
and a track suit.

37
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,800
You know who wears
track suits?
Athletes?

38
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,100
No. Huge tubs of lard
or retired people.

39
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,900
And rap stars.

40
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,200
The teeth suggest
early middle age.

41
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,800
So not a retiree.

42
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,100
Uh, calcified holes
with radial fractures

43
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,500
in the left clavicle
and scapula are consistent

44
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,800
with ballistic damage.

45
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,600
He was shot
to death?
And stabbed.

46
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,900
But neither killed him.

47
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,300
The wounds healed.

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,900
Shot, stabbed,
but lived to die another day?

49
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,300
Rap star.

50
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,000
There is a small hole
in the back of the cranium.

51
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,300
Get the skull out first,
establish cause of death,

52
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,600
then give Angela something
to work with to ID the guy.

53
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,700
Where is Angela?

54
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm really not good
at this kind of thing.

55
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,300
You know, I don't...

56
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't get
the significance.

57
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,800
One year ago today,

58
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,800
you buried your mother.

59
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,300
You laid
her to rest.

60
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,500
Here.

61
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,200
You're marking
the anniversary.

62
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,200
Angela, I simply
don't believe

63
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,700
my mother retained sentience
beyond death.

64
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,900
Well, part of you is made
up of your mother, right?

65
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,300
In a manner of speaking.

66
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,500
So, honor that
part of yourself.

67
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
Visualize a
memory of her.

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,000
See what it brings up.

69
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,300
I have very few
distinct memories of my mother.

70
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll wait in the car.

71
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,500
Hiya, honey.

72
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,000
I was hoping you
might show up.

73
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,800
I don't... I don't want
to talk to you.

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,600
We're standing here

75
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,300
in front of your
mother's grave.

76
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,500
Obviously, you've come
for some kind of answer.

77
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,400
Maybe I can... provide 'em.

78
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
You're a killer.

79
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,800
You burn people.

80
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah, I'd like to report
a sighting of Max Keenan

81
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,300
at Eternal Spring
Memorial Gardens.

82
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,200
He's a wanted
fugitive.

83
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,900
I love you.

84
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,800
Yes, I'm sure.

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,200
Because he's my father.

86
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:08,100
 <font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

88
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,000
 ??? your dad at
all before you called the cops?

89
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,800
No. Why would I?

90
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,500
Well, I mean, I
haven't seen my
dad in a long time,

91
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,400
and if I had
the opportunity
to talk... Ow!

92
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,900
Go to a
dentist.

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,900
Oh, I will
if it doesn't
get any better.

94
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,100
Based on decomposition
of the track suit,

95
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,300
Hodgins is estimating
a postmortem interval
of two years.

96
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,400
Based on bone deterioration,
I like three years.

97
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,400
Well, what
killed him?

98
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,800
The victim was dead
shortly after

99
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,100
this hole was punched
into his skull.

100
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,600
Too small for a projectile.

101
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,900
No radiating stress lines.

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,600
A slow entry, a piercing wound.

103
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,200
Like a-a
screwdriver?

104
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,700
Nail gun?
Ice pick?

105
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,300
Yeah, something
along those lines.

106
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,300
Oh. Cold steel to the brain--
would that kill him?

107
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Depending how far
it penetrated.

108
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,700
Yeah, it's Booth.

109
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,100
I need, um, all murders

110
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,900
in which a penetrating wound
to the back of the head figured.

111
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,700
Great. Thanks.

112
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't freak out.

113
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,100
Oh!

114
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,700
You broke
into my house?

115
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,800
That is not
acceptable.

116
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,800
This, uh,

117
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,300
little device here--
it jams cell phone frequencies.

118
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,100
That is illegal.

119
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,300
Unfortunately,
illegal

120
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:47,199
is what I do best.

121
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
I'm not staying.

122
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,400
I just want you
to do something for me.

123
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,000
I want you to take a look
at my rap sheet.

124
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,800
Why?
Why?

125
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,000
Because I want a chance to talk
to you-- actually talk to you--

126
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,100
without you calling in
the 82nd Airborne.

127
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
How is reading
your police record

128
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,800
going to change my mind?

129
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,700
Just do it.

130
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,300
I think our victim
was killed by Ice Pick.

131
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,800
Angela did a facial
reconstruction of Cement Head.

132
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,400
Concrete Head, you mean.

133
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,400
No, Cement Head--
it's got a nicer ring.

134
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,300
So, I ran it through
IntelPlus and got a match.

135
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,900
William Raymond "Billy Ray"

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,800
McKenna.
West Virginia.

137
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,300
"Assault, manslaughter,
kidnapping,

138
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
torture...."
This here...

139
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,400
This here is, uh, Hugh Kennedy.

140
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,400
Uh, I think
he killed Cement Head.

141
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,200
Why?

142
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,100
Well, West Virginia,

143
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,500
likes to use an ice pick
on his victims, plus Ice Pick

144
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,400
and Cement Head
were both employed

145
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,400
by a regional crime boss
in West Virginia

146
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,100
named... Gallagher.

147
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,900
Well, what are we going
to call him?

148
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,099
Gallagher.

149
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,900
But he runs
most of the, uh, prostitutes,

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,900
strippers, gambling,
bootlegging, meth,

151
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,300
extortion in West Virginia.

152
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,100
Five years ago,
the West Virginia

153
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,100
State Police began pressuring

154
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,900
Gallagher's criminal operation,
making a lot of arrests.

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,900
Including Ice Pick
and Cement Head.

156
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Cement Head goes to jail.

157
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,200
Ice Pick? 
Out on bail, babe.

158
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,800
You say that
like it means something.

159
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,500
Oh, I talked to the officer
in charge, and he said

160
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,900
that Ice Pick
wouldn't say anything,

161
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,300
so they punished him
by letting him out

162
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,300
on bail.

163
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,000
How is bail punishment?

164
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,400
'Cause it makes Gallagher think

165
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,800
that Ice Pick cooperated
with the cops.

166
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,700
You know,
it's criminal
psychology, Bones.

167
00:07:26,701 --> 00:07:27,599
You know, you wouldn't get it.

168
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Just read. Just continue
reading there, will you?

169
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,800
"Half a million
dollar bond.

170
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,400
"Kennedy jumped bail.

171
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,100
"Killed in a car accident

172
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,700
while fleeing
a Bail Fugitive Recovery agent."

173
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,000
Bounty Hunter.
"Car burned the remains to ashes."

174
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,200
All they got was a severed leg.

175
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,600
They didn't actually get
Ice Pick's body.

176
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,900
So, are we going to talk
to the bounty hunter?

177
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,500
No, I am. You're gonna make sure

178
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,400
that that severed leg
actually belonged to Ice Pick.

179
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,800
Well, someone kept the leg?

180
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,700
The severed leg
was frozen as evidence.

181
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,300
So, you think
Ice Pick might still be alive?

182
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,300
As a friend
of mine

183
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,100
likes to say,
"Don't jump to conclusions

184
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,600
until all the evidence is in."

185
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,800
If the facts are in, then
it's not jumping to conclusions,

186
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,700
so I never
said that.

187
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,300
I never said
that the friend is you, okay?

188
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,300
Does it have to be completely
thawed for you to examine?

189
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,700
No. My interest lies
only in the femur.

190
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,300
I need to get some tissue
for DNA testing.

191
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,100
I'm the bounty hunter
you want to talk to.

192
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,300
Veleska Miller.

193
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,200
You want to know
about Kennedy's leg?

194
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,700
Anything you want to tell me
outside the official report,

195
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,600
that's great.

196
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,600
Sure.

197
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,800
How it smelled,
his body cooking over the fire.

198
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,900
Otherwise,
I stand by the record.

199
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,000
How'd you find him?

200
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,900
Tip from someone I know
who provides documents

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,100
to fugitives.

202
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,800
Tailed him, he made me,
took off.

203
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,900
Boom!

204
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,000
Found his leg about 30 yards
from the vehicle.

205
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,600
And you saw him burn?

206
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700
Yeah.

207
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Why?

208
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
That's it?

209
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,800
That's it.

210
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,600
I'm a little disappointed.

211
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,600
I was hoping
you'd keep me here a while,

212
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,500
ask me some dumb-ass
federal questions, check me out.

213
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,900
How's about
I buy you a nice breakfast, huh?

214
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,400
Guy like you must be going crazy
in the FBI.

215
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,800
What kind of guy is that,
exactly?

216
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,400
I'm a bounty hunter, sport.

217
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,300
I read people fast, or I die.

218
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,500
You are not standard
government issue.

219
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,800
Take a walk
on the wild side.

220
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,200
I have more fun, fewer rules,

221
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,800
and a lot of money.

222
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,500
Yeah.

223
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,200
You make a compelling case.

224
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,500
Booth.

225
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,800
Coroner's report said

226
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,000
Kennedy's leg was severed
in the car accident.

227
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,300
We don't call him Kennedy.

228
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,600
We call him Ice Pick.

229
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,400
Hold on for one second. Sorry.

230
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,600
Yeah. Aah.

231
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,600
Listen, I got the, uh,
bounty hunter here.

232
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,100
She was an eyewitness
to the crash.

233
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,300
Saw him incinerated.

234
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,100
Tell Booth that Ice Pick's
femur is sliced cleanly

235
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,600
at 90 degrees.

236
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,600
I can hear you, Bones.

237
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,300
Okay? It's a speakerphone.

238
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,600
Look, amputation
like that could happen

239
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,000
in a bad wreck,
right, Cam?

240
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,200
Yes.

241
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,200
Well, there are kerf marks.

242
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,200
She's seeing evidence
of a saw, Booth.

243
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,400
Look, I know
what kerf marks are.

244
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,600
Booth should arrest
the bounty hunter.

245
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,300
I can hear you, Bones.

246
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,700
What am I gonna
arrest her for, huh?

247
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,400
For lying, for perjury.

248
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,600
For aiding in a cover-up.

249
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,500
If she's there with you,
just detain her.

250
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,500
Okay.

251
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,500
 ???

252
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,600
Hey, look at that, huh?
DNA is a match.

253
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,800
West Virginia
state troopers

254
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,300
got a DNA sample
at Ice Pick's arrest.

255
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,600
This is definitely his leg.

256
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Was she pretty?

257
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,700
Ice Pick is a male.

258
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,700
I mean the bounty hunter
who gave Booth the slip.

259
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,300
You know, she didn't get away
because she was pretty.

260
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,100
She was a <i>she?</i>
No, she was a...

261
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,400
Oh...

262
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,000
What's wrong with your mouth?

263
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
I'm guessing the
anterior molar

264
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,900
on the left
side is infected.

265
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,000
The leg was
surgically amputated.

266
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Go to a dentist.

267
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,600
He's afraid
of the dentist.

268
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,000
These kerf marks are

269
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,300
consistent with a type

270
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,200
of wire saw used
to remove horns

271
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,700
from heifers.
Ah, so...

272
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,700
Ice Pick and this bounty
hunter set up a car accident

273
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,300
with a dummy victim so
everyone stops looking for him.

274
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,800
Two years later he kills
Con-- Cement Head.

275
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,700
She hoodwinked you
'cause she was hot.

276
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,100
All right, look, you know what?

277
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,700
She wasn't hot.
In fact, she looked like a man.

278
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,600
The amputation
was probably performed

279
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,400
by a livestock veterinarian.
Hey, Bones,
I've got that other

280
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
thing you want to discuss.

281
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,000
Oh, let's...

282
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,700
go to my office

283
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,700
so we don't
disturb Cam.

284
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,900
Booth?
Yeah?

285
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,200
Livestock amputation.
That is one tough,

286
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,500
determined old criminal.
Be careful.

287
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
You know, I was going
 through your father's

288
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,700
crim...
Shh!

289
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,700
...criminal record and he was
right about one thing.

290
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,600
You know, he never ended
anyone's life who didn't

291
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,500
have it coming to them.
He's a sociopath.

292
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,200
Well, maybe, but at
least he aimed in the
right direction.

293
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,900
Ow!
Let me take a look
at your tooth.

294
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,800
All right, just...

295
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,100
Go easy. You promise?

296
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,300
Okay.
All right.

297
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,200
Open up.
You know,

298
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,800
What?

299
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,199
In the Old West,

300
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,700
he would have been
considered a hero.

301
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,300
Yeah, well, the Old West
Ow!

302
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,700
was a time of chaos
and violence that,

303
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,200
anthropologically speaking,

304
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,500
our country is still
Ow!

305
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,900
trying to recover from.

306
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,700
Yeah, I was right.
Anterior molar on the left side,

307
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,300
it's infected.

308
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,700
You know, your
father never killed

309
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,100
any hardworking, tax-paying

310
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,700
citizens or honest cops.

311
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,600
Ow!
You still think

312
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,200
that society
should forgive him?
All I'm saying

313
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,000
is if I have an opportunity
to arrest him, I will.

314
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,600
But you know who maybe

315
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,900
should forgive him?

316
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,500
His daughter.

317
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,400
Oh, look at that.

318
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,300
The small town
crime boss is here.

319
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,200
Let's go have a little chat
with him, shall we?

320
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,700
Billy Ray McKenna shortly before

321
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,300
he became Cement Head.

322
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,500
I like nicknames.

323
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,700
They are universal
mnemonic devices.

324
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,100
Why are we doing this?
Don't we know that cause

325
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,500
of death was brain scrambling
due to an ice pick?

326
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
The technical term is "pithing."

327
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,900
 <i>And</i> it's not how he died.

328
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,500
It entered
the medullary

329
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,800
pyramids, and beveling
on the entry site suggests

330
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,900
it was...

331
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,700
I don't believe there's
an English word that

332
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,300
adequately describes...

333
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,200
Wiggling. Up and down

334
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,600
is wiggling.
Okay...

335
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,600
wiggled, thus
paralyzing the victim

336
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,300
and causing some
difficulty breathing.

337
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,900
But he would live for upwards

338
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,900
of several hours.
Smart.

339
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,700
Very little
blood spilled.

340
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,300
How did the victim die?

341
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,900
This is the bad part.

342
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,100
It appears that the concrete

343
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,500
was poured over him
while he was still alive.

344
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,300
Oh...

345
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,100
These chunks of concrete

346
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,100
are in the shape of...

347
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,100
a sinus cavity,

348
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,600
bronchial tubes,

349
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,800
plus a kind of a hollow

350
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,200
around the middle finger.

351
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,400
You said he was paralyzed.

352
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,400
Well, if the ice pick was
inserted and then waggled...

353
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,900
...it would affect
the median nerve

354
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,500
and the T1 nerve roots.

355
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,800
Which control
the flexor carpi radialis.

356
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,900
Anterior palm, thumb,
index and middle fingers.

357
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,500
But if it was...

358
00:14:58,501 --> 00:14:59,399
Wiggled.

359
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,800
...the victim would
lose the ability

360
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,400
to move the ring
and pinky fingers.

361
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,300
We think he wiggled
instead of waggled.

362
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,500
Because he could still
move his middle finger.

363
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,400
It's a terrible way to die.

364
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,400
Our conclusion
is that he was trying
to swim to the surface

365
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,100
using only
his middle finger.

366
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,500
The last time I saw
Billy Ray McKenna

367
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,000
he was "So long, suckering" me
from his F-150

368
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,900
and heading off
on a well-earned vacation.

369
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,700
Well-earned by torturing
a journalist

370
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,200
who was talking too much.

371
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,000
Well, I resent
your inference.

372
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,700
Get him my, uh...

373
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,100
whatcha call it? Tax papers,

374
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,800
employment records.
Did I get that right?

375
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,700
Not quite. You resent
his implication.

376
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,200
He's implying that
you're a criminal.

377
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,300
You're taking inference 
with hisimplication.
-Have at it.

378
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,100
According to this, Mr. Lightner
is your flight instructor.

379
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,300
That is correct.

380
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,000
I have wide-ranging enterprises.

381
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,600
Clark here is helpful
in getting me

382
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,600
where I got to get.

383
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,300
And William Raymond McKenna

384
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,100
is down as a media liaison.

385
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,300
Yep, by breaking
journalists' fingers.

386
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,900
You know, you never
asked me about, uh,

387
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,300
Billy Ray McKenna
there, big dog.

388
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
Well, I assume,
big dog, that, uh,

389
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,300
Billy Ray is deceased.

390
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,300
Why?

391
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,000
He was a valued employee.

392
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,300
Disappears for three years,

393
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,800
I got to assume the worst.

394
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,200
His body was found
encased in concrete.

395
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,600
Tell you what, we're gonna
claim his remains.

396
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,800
We'll bury him proper.

397
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,200
Where'd you send
him on vacation?

398
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,200
Canada.
Canada?

399
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,400
Was it the Mounties that

400
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,600
found Billy Ray
encased in cement?

401
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,100
Concrete.
Hmm?

402
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,500
Not cement. It's a common error.

403
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,500
Baltimore Police.

404
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,600
Is Baltimore on the way
to Canada?
Well, the most

405
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,900
efficient route is
up through Detroit,

406
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,100
but Billy Ray, hell,
he loved Vermont so.

407
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,200
Do you have any idea who might
want to kill Mr. McKenna?

408
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,400
Oh, hell, yeah. He, uh...

409
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,000
Well, how would you put it?
Aggressive.

410
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,800
Yeah.
Both socially
and sexually.

411
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,300
How about Hugh Kennedy?

412
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,200
Hugh Kennedy.

413
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,900
Yeah, handy with the ice pick.

414
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,200
According to this,

415
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,900
you hired him as a "Liquor

416
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,800
License Consultant
on a per case basis."

417
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes. I remember.

418
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,600
Taciturn type. Very dour.

419
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,700
Right. In jail
for murder once,

420
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,000
manslaughter twice,

421
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,000
and suspect in four
unsolved murders,

422
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,600
all involving ice picks.

423
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,600
You know, good old Hugh did not
put none of that on his rÈsumÈ.

424
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,600
If I recall, Mr. Kennedy

425
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,500
was killed in a car accident

426
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,400
fleeing a bail
enforcement officer.

427
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,900
Got burned up.

428
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,900
Well... you guys look us up

429
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,600
if you're ever
in western West Virginia.

430
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,900
We're at Snackie's
Roadhouse and Grill.

431
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Where the 119
hits the 64.

432
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,900
I'll make a
note of that.

433
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,600
119 hits the...

434
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,500
64.
64.

435
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,800
Hey, T, look.

436
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,600
Snickerdoodles. What do...

437
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,900
Oh, come on,
you used to love them.

438
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,600
When you were
a little girl.

439
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,800
I got a message for you
from your brother.

440
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,100
What message?

441
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,000
Uh, he says, um...
He says "hi."

442
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,700
Have you turned Russ
into a criminal, too?

443
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,700
Hey, I haven't
committed a crime

444
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,300
in over 15 years.

445
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,900
I'm straight.
Except for

446
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,600
killing, gutting, and burning

447
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,200
the deputy director
of the FBI.

448
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,400
He was trying to kill Russ,
and then he was going

449
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,600
after you. It is not

450
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,500
a crime to protect your family.

451
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Some fathers do it
without killing.

452
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,600
Did, uh... you and Booth

453
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,600
take a look at my,
uh, rap sheet?

454
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,000
Yes.

455
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,500
And?

456
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,200
He'll arrest you if
he has the chance.

457
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,300
What else?

458
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,700
So the snickerdoodles.
Come on.

459
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,500
You don't remember?
You loved them as a little girl.

460
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,700
I don't remember.

461
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,400
I'd come home,
and then you'd

462
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,700
be jumping around. You were five
or six years old and you'd say,

463
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,300
"Come on, why don't you
put on the trying song?

464
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,600
Put on the trying song!"
The trying song?

465
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,000
It was my favorite song.

466
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,500
I used to sing it.
It was, uh... by Poco.

467
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,800
The band.

468
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,200
Hugh Kennedy?

469
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:05,200
Bad guy, but he's dead.

470
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,100
About five years ago in a car
crash in West Virginia.

471
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,700
Recent evidence
suggests otherwise.
How do you know him?

472
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,600
Well, him and his ice pick were
pretty famous in some circles.

473
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
I've got to go.

474
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,100
Now?
Yeah.

475
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,500
You speed-dialed Booth.

476
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,700
He's been listening
to everything and the...

477
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,600
the SWAT team's on its way.

478
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,900
I mean, I'm
just guessing.

479
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,700
But there is something I
do want to say to you.

480
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,600
Mom?

481
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,100
It's not about Mom,

482
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,700
it's about you
and it's about stuff

483
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,300
that she wanted you to know.

484
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,900
She never got the
chance to tell you.

485
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,300
Hey, Booth, there's a couple

486
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,500
of things that you should know
about this guy, Kennedy.

487
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,700
He's got an addiction
to model airplanes.

488
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Try some of these again.
You'll love them.

489
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,500
Wait, Dad...
What's...

490
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,800
What's the second thing?

491
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,000
Mmm, he's wily.

492
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,300
You be careful, okay?

493
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,100
Did you get that?

494
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,500
I've got to tell you,
you were right, Zack.

495
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,300
Every model airplane freak

496
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,700
from Baltimore is here.

497
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,600
We prefer the term "pilots."

498
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,600
Yeah, okay.

499
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,000
So you're into this stuff,
too, huh?

500
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,600
Yeah, forensic anthropology
is only one of my doctorates.

501
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,900
The other is in
applied engineering.

502
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,300
I'm extremely adept at
practical aeronautics.

503
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,500
Do you see Ice Pick?

504
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,700
A lot of these guys are
kind of old.

505
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,900
You know,
they're wearing those, uh...

506
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,200
those sunglasses
that wrap around their heads.

507
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,100
Well, how many of them
only have one leg?

508
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,000
Well, half of them
are sitting down.

509
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,000
Okay, how am I going to get them
to stand up?

510
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,800
Crashes bring everyone
to their feet.

511
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,600
W... uh, shoot down
one of the planes.

512
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,100
That's great,
and the next thing you know,

513
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,700
I'm being evaluated
by my shrink again.

514
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
That's not going to happen.

515
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,000
Drive onto the field.

516
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:13,899
What?

517
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,400
Put your car
where they like to land.

518
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,400
Everyone will stand up
and yell at you.

519
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,500
This better work.

520
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,500
Okay, just stay with me here.

521
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Oops.

522
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,300
Look at that, huh?

523
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
It seems to be working.

524
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,300
Ha, ha. Oh, they're mad.

525
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,500
Do you see him?

526
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,400
They're all wearing long pants.

527
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,800
I mean, how can I tell if any of
them are wearing a prosthetic?

528
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,400
The prosthetic will cause

529
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
a slightly unnatural
alignment of the spine,

530
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,900
which will result in a
compensating adjustment of...

531
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,300
Booth, the instinct will be
for these men to step

532
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,300
toward you.

533
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,700
One man will be standing
perfectly still.

534
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,400
Okay.

535
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,600
Yep, I got him.

536
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,000
Sorry.

537
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,000
I apologize.

538
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,600
Just passing through.

539
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,900
Afternoon.

540
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,700
Anybody asking after me?

541
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,300
Nope.

542
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,500
What the hell?

543
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,100
I'm gonna need his room number.

544
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,700
Maybe I can help you.

545
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,400
What did you hit me with?

546
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,500
Huh?

547
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,900
Only reason I ask is my
tooth doesn't hurt anymore.

548
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,400
You know, you're the first guy

549
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,100
that got the drop on me
in ten years.

550
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,000
I used to get that a lot.

551
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,100
Can I ask you a question?

552
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,700
As long as you answer one
for me, then.

553
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,100
 ???

554
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Huh?
What's your story?

555
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,900
Billy Ray got
in the back of my cab.

556
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,700
Don't know which one of us
was bigger surprised,

557
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,600
but it must have been Billy Ray

558
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,700
'cause he's the one
ended up dead.

559
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,200
Hey, what's your question?

560
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,300
How you people find him
under all that cement?

561
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,400
A dog.

562
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,800
Dog, huh?
Yeah.

563
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,500
So why am I not dead?

564
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,400
I never killed nobody for fun.

565
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,500
It was my job.

566
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And I'm retired.

567
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,100
Now, listen.

568
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,600
I know you fellas get in trouble
if you lose your gun.

569
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,100
I'm taking the bullets,
though, if you don't mind.

570
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,000
Oh.

571
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,700
Well, what about me?
Settle down.

572
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,900
What?
Settle down, relax.

573
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,700
Someone'll find you.

574
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,000
You have a good day now.

575
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,900
I just want to talk
about your mother.

576
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,100
Booth is missing.

577
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,500
It's been over 18 hours.

578
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,100
He tried to take down
Hugh Kennedy by himself?

579
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,600
He's only got one leg
and he's old.

580
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,600
Yeah, you know
how he got old?

581
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,700
By being fast and paranoid.

582
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,300
He cut off his own leg.

583
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,200
Booth is tough.

584
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,100
What does the FBI say?

585
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Nothing.

586
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,400
Yeah, "need to
know," right?

587
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,600
Mm-hmm.

588
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,300
I want to do something, but
I don't... I don't know what.

589
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,500
Are you asking?

590
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,200
You'd help find the man who's
going to put you in jail?

591
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,600
Well, Booth will...
will do the best he can,

592
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,600
I'll do the best I can,

593
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,500
and we'll see how it works
out when we get there.

594
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
W-Where did he find Kennedy?

595
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
Baltimore.

596
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,100
I'm afraid that's
not Hugh Kennedy.

597
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,300
What's that called when they
wrap a sausage in a pancake?

598
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,700
Pigs in a blanket.

599
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,200
Pigs in a blanket.

600
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,700
Now how'd you get here?

601
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,800
How'd you get here?

602
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,500
Billy Ray was killed
by an ice pick in Baltimore.

603
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,400
We asked around.

604
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,100
Was it Hugh Kennedy that
bundled you up in a carpet?

605
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,000
Look, I can't discuss
an ongoing investigation

606
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,000
with civilians, all right?
So just cut me out of here.

607
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,700
Hey, what are you doing with my
gun? Put that down.

608
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,500
Okay, time to step out
of your comfort zone, people.

609
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,400
What comfort zone?

610
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,400
We've stopped working.
I'd like to start again.

611
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,800
We process evidence.

612
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,500
There's no more evidence
for us to process.

613
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,600
He's right. We process,
Booth interprets.

614
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,200
I'd like to give it a try.

615
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,300
Yeah, we suck at interpretation.

616
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,300
We absolutely blow.

617
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,500
Um, what do you want us to do?

618
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,600
Work what we know.

619
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,400
McKenna was probably killed
by Kennedy.

620
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,600
Booth ran afoul of Kennedy.

621
00:27:43,602 --> 00:27:44,399
I'm with you.

622
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,400
I'm with you, not ahead of you.

623
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,700
Okay, is there any
forensic evidence on our victim

624
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,400
that might lead
to Kennedy and Booth?

625
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,000
Yeah, I mean,
I've finished the inventory

626
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,300
on McKenna's tracksuit.

627
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,600
There were flakes
of tobacco,

628
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,200
fibers from the upholstery

629
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,200
of a Crown Victoria,

630
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,000
popcorn, chocolate,

631
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,100
a host of other wool
and cotton threads.

632
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,500
Okay, what does that tell us?

633
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,000
That the man was a pig?

634
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
All right, look,
there were also

635
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,900
cellulose fibers
consistent with newsprint,

636
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,900
gum from a number
of different mouths.

637
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,900
Uh, he had dried
chunks of human mucous,

638
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,600
a half dozen
filaments of nylon

639
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,900
consistent with
women's hosiery.

640
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,900
Oh! Uh, Kennedy
was a transvestite.

641
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,000
Keep going.

642
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,200
The rest was
just waxy buildup

643
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,000
from soap
or upholstery cleaner.

644
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,000
Let's assume
all this adds up to a place.

645
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,900
Crime scene.

646
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,400
Close your eyes

647
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,700
and imagine the smell
of all those things.

648
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,300
Tobacco, snot,

649
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,300
gum,

650
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
popcorn,

651
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,700
a lot of clothing, chocolate...

652
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,700
A porno movie theater!

653
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,900
You can't smoke at the movies.

654
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,500
I don't know about porno.

655
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,300
Upholstery cleaner,
Crown Victoria...

656
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,900
I got it.

657
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,000
A taxi cab.

658
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,500
McKenna was killed
in a taxi cab.

659
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Yes.

660
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,800
Where are you going?

661
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,100
To tell the FBI

662
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,100
they're looking for a one-legged
cabbie in Baltimore.

663
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,300
You know, you guys,
 it's not like

664
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,200
we all know each other
off the field, so...

665
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,800
But you know a man
with a prosthetic leg?

666
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,200
Uh... yeah,
I've seen him around.

667
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
We need his name.

668
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,000
No, honey,
he'd be using a fake name.

669
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,200
No, we need to know
where he lives.

670
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,300
Well, maybe he's listed
under his fake name.

671
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,300
He's too careful for that.

672
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,000
He drives a cab.

673
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,300
How do you know that?

674
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,400
My associates
are very good, Dad.

675
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,100
Can I ask a question?

676
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,300
Do you guys have any, like,
official I.D. or anything?

677
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,300
I can have the FBI here
in 20 minutes.
No, no, no.

678
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,300
Screw the FBI.
No, no, no!

679
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,300
Hold on! Easy!

680
00:29:48,301 --> 00:29:49,199
Take it easy, pal.

681
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,800
Where does he live?
I don't know!

682
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,800
Dad!
No!

683
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,100
All right, all right!
Halton Inn on Decatur.

684
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,200
No, no, no!
Dad, he told us!

685
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,100
Are you lying to me? Because
if you are, I'll know it!

686
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,800
Halton Inn on Decatur,
just past the tracks. Easy.

687
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,600
Wha...?!

688
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
What's that all about?

689
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,500
Thank you.

690
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,900
You're welcome.
Your dad's a psycho,

691
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,200
by the way.
You have no idea.

692
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,100
Do you have a one-legged
old man staying here?

693
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,100
Give me 40 bucks.

694
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,500
Room number, please.

695
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,900
Dad!

696
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,700
I... I have money.

697
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,200
Dad, look out!

698
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,700
Who is she?

699
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,200
I don't think
she's going to tell us.

700
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,100
Come on, help me!

701
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,000
Pull! Pull!

702
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,600
 ???

703
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,900
Hey. Hey, listen to me.
I like you.

704
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,100
But if you make
another move on me,

705
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,000
I will hurt you. You understand?

706
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,700
If her name's Veleska,
she's the same bounty hunter

707
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,100
who brought in Kennedy's leg.

708
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,100
How'd you find him?

709
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,000
It's not that hard
to find a one-legged,

710
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,600
old, white hit man
in Baltimore.

711
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,500
Why is she after him?

712
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,200
She has to make sure
that Kennedy

713
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,600
stays gone.
I helped

714
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,300
a wanted fugitive evade arrest.

715
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,600
I'm not going to jail.

716
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,800
What have you got?

717
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,800
It's a left anterior molar.

718
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,600
It's Booth's tooth.

719
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:27,099
Where's Booth?

720
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,200
Temperance, honey!

721
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,800
Kennedy has Booth, Dad.

722
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,900
He's got Booth!
Okay.

723
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,100
Perhaps he didn't see Kennedy.

724
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,300
Yeah? How'd you come
to that thought?

725
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:42,499
Well, Kennedy would
have left him

726
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,000
with an ice pick
protruding from his head.

727
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,000
Just one simple
question, big dog.

728
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,000
Did you see Kennedy?

729
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,100
Well, we could
get our own ice pick.

730
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,000
Make it look
like Kennedy killed him.

731
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,400
You know we can't let you live,
right?

732
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,700
You've been struck
and restrained.

733
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,800
Technically, kidnapping
a federal agent is as bad

734
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,500
as murdering him
these days.

735
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,600
How would you like to kill him?

736
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,800
First, I got to know for sure
if Kennedy is dead or alive.

737
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,600
Good luck with that one,
big dog.

738
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,500
Oh, big dog.

739
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,600
I suppose we could do that thing
that McKenna used to do,

740
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,200
but I'd need a blowtorch
and a sharpened screwdriver.

741
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,600
Just tell us.

742
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,500
Woof.

743
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:31,900
Cute.
Oh!

744
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,400
Must be his kid.
Yeah.

745
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,400
Head like a anvil.

746
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,200
I hurt my hand.

747
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,300
All right.

748
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,600
I'm gonna let you take a look
at your sweet boy,

749
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,700
consign his face
into your memory,

750
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,600
and then I'm gonna ask you which
one of your eyes you like best.

751
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,500
Definitely Booth's tooth.

752
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,700
I knew it.

753
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,100
Brennan...

754
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,300
You're not alone in this.

755
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,900
I know I'm not alone.

756
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,700
We all want to find Booth.

757
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,900
I know.

758
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,800
This is one of those times
when I have no idea
what's happening.

759
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,600
Brennan, wait.

760
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,500
I have to go, Ange.
What's going on?

761
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,700
I've got to find Booth.

762
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,900
I'm coming with you.
No.

763
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,000
I can't fight
or shoot a gun,

764
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,400
but if something bad
happens, I can spit
with deadly accuracy.

765
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,500
Thanks, but no.

766
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,300
Why can't you tell me?

767
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,000
By definition,
I can't tell you.

768
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,000
All right, all right,
Hodgins is outside
in his fastest car.

769
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,600
It's Italian.

770
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,900
One call and he follows
you everywhere.

771
00:33:51,901 --> 00:33:52,699
Angela...

772
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,600
All right, you're after a
crazy, old, ice pick hit man

773
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,700
who has Booth.

774
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,900
You need help.

775
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,800
Look at my face.

776
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,900
Do you really see
me backing down?

777
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,700
I... I already have help, Ange.

778
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,300
From who?

779
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,900
From someone
worse than Kennedy.

780
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,500
Are you serious?

781
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,500
Don't say it.

782
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,000
You're father
is helping you?
I have to go.

783
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,600
Dad!

784
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,000
Was it Booth's tooth?

785
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,400
Yes. Stop that.

786
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,200
What are you doing?

787
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,200
Well, we have to know for sure
if Kennedy is alive or dead.

788
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,300
I mean, what if she and
her friends took Booth?

789
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,200
If this bothers you,
maybe you should go.

790
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,400
No, alpha male,
man of action...

791
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,200
I... I get it.

792
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,900
Now, tell us.

793
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,000
Okay... okay...

794
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,300
Kennedy is alive.

795
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
I was chasing him
for the bail.

796
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,600
He was smarter than me,
and he gave me a choice:

797
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,600
help him fake his death
or die myself.

798
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,400
Where'd you get the body?

799
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,600
We stole some dead old geezer
from a mortuary in Charleston.

800
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,200
Where is my partner?

801
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,100
When I got here,
no one was here.

802
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,100
I swear.

803
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,300
What do we do with her?

804
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,700
The room is paid for
through the end of the week.

805
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,500
Kennedy does not have Booth.

806
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,500
How do you know?

807
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,600
He's only got one leg.

808
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,100
So?

809
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,500
Well, so he's retired.

810
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,500
He's like me.

811
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,700
He just... he just
wants to disappear.

812
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,400
Then who's got Booth?

813
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,400
Well, there's only one other
significant player in all this.

814
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,100
 ???

815
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,100
What am I going to do
with you when I 
get to the lab?

816
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,500
I'll just take a nap
here in the car.

817
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,100
Awfully exciting day
for an old guy like me.

818
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,500
Booth is being held
by Melvin Gallagher.

819
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,700
That's a leap.
How do you know?

820
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,900
Can we just go
with this, please?

821
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,900
Of course not.

822
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,800
Obviously, Brennan found
out from her father--

823
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,900
who is a wanted fugitive.
Ange!

824
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,200
Now that I can go with.

825
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,200
We need to figure out where
Gallagher is holding Booth.

826
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,700
Has anybody noticed that every
time there's a panic situation,

827
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,500
all eyes turn to Hodgins?

828
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,300
It's okay.

829
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,700
What's he
supposed to do?

830
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,700
Shoes.
Shoes?

831
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,500
Gallagher said the last time
he saw McKenna

832
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,300
he was leaving for vacation
after a tough night at work.

833
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,600
You think Gallagher might have
a place

834
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,000
he takes people
for that sort of thing?

835
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,400
Let me go over
Cement Head's shoes--
see what they tell us.

836
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,300
Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone.

837
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,300
It's a solvent.

838
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,300
See if it has any
specialized uses.

839
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,300
Also chromic

840
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,200
MEK and chromic acid are both
used to prepare metals.

841
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,100
Prepare metals for what?

842
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,900
Coating-- painting mostly.
Electroplating.

843
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,000
I'm seeing micro-thin deposits
of aluminum here.

844
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,100
Shavings?

845
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,800
No, it's more anodized...
vapor deposition.

846
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,100
Gallagher flies everywhere?

847
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,100
An aluminum propeller requires
a coating that could withstand

848
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,600
between ten and 20 tons
of centrifugal force.

849
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,500
Preferably anodized.

850
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,800
These are Gallagher's
tax returns.

851
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,400
We're looking for the
purchase of any machine

852
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,800
that could be used
for anodization.

853
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,100
What, like
a copier, or...?

854
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,900
Oh, that's so
cute, but no.

855
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,800
Look for the words
"lamination, electroplating."

856
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,500
"Alloy membranes,
catalytic bed reactor..."

857
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,200
"A serial thermal processor."

858
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,800
"Vacuum pyrolysis."

859
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,600
"D-330 Vacuum plating
processor"?

860
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,300
Yeah, that's it.
That's it.

861
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,000
Yes, this is Dr. Brennan
at the Jeffersonian.

862
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,000
I just received a call
from Agent Booth

863
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,000
that he's being
held at...

864
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,000
the Purdue Airfield
in Oakville, Virginia.

865
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,100
Send backup, I'm going in.

866
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,600
You just lied your ass off

867
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,800
to the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

868
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
That is so hot.

869
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,600
If you lie really still,
you may not die.

870
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,900
I need your car.

871
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,600
Max Keenan,
you're under arrest.

872
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,900
Not if I get the keys.

873
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,600
They're in the ignition.

874
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,600
Well, it's not like I actually
gave him the keys.

875
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,300
Why didn't you just... just
tell them about Kennedy?

876
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,900
Well, I needed to give
you time to find me.

877
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,000
I've been tortured worse.

878
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,400
So, uh, you hear anything
from your old man?

879
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,600
He left my car in the garage.

880
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,800
He'll be back.

881
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:29,900
How do you know?

882
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,300
Max Keenan does not strike
me as the kind of guy

883
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,000
who, uh, leaves things undone.

884
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,600
Next time he shows up,
what do I do?

885
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,000
Do I call you?
Do I knock him on the head?

886
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,400
What's my obligation?

887
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,500
Well, if I were you, Bones,

888
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,800
I'd want to know what he has

891
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,100
It's called "Keep on Trying."

892
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,200
Yeah, Poco.

893
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,900

894
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,400

00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,500

00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,200
Right.
