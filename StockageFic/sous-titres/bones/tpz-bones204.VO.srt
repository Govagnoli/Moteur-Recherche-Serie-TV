00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:05,333
<i>Hikers aren't supposed to let</i>
<i>their dogs off the leash back here.</i>

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:09,239
But I'm pretty sure the dog was running free
when he found the... what he found.

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,300
- What's the condition of the body?
- No idea.

4
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,642
- Can't get close enough to examine it.
- Why not?

5
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:16,147
- The dog's definitely not on his leash at this time.
- <i>[Dog Growling]</i>

6
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,150
- Oh.
- Put down the bone.

7
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,152
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>How the hell are we gonna get to the body?</i>

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,154
- Buddy, drop it.
- <i>You don't see that every day.</i>

9
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:25,123
<i>Sent for animal control.</i>
<i>Take another hour though.</i>

10
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:29,491
<i>Drop it now! I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>He's never done anything like this.</i>

11
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:31,496
You ever have a dog, Bones?

12
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:33,464
- I always wanted a pig.
- A pig?

13
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,934
Very smart, and despite the popular
misconception, very clean.

14
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,904
I prefer my pig with a little mint,
a little honey glaze...

15
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:43,739
Not funny. In some cultures,
dogs can guard corpses...

16
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,938
sometimes to the point of starvation,
so shoot it.

17
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:50,471
I'm not shooting him for just
doing what comes naturally.

18
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,609
As far as he's concerned,
you know, finder's keepers.

19
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:57,122
That dog is compromising the integrity
of my remains, so wing it... him.

20
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,283
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>There's another way, Bones.</i>

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,759
Dogs love me.

22
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:04,490
Nice doggy.
Good pooch.

23
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:08,864
Ah! Nice doggy.
Good pooch.

24
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:12,837
- [Barking]
- Oh! Hey, we're just gonna wait for animal control.

25
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,668
- I'll do it. [Whistles]
- Oh, yeah.

26
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:21,971
- Yeah. A pinecone's really gonna work.
- Buddy! Buddy!

27
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,982
- Okay.
- Come back here!

28
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,280
I need everybody to clear the area.
Set up a perimeter.

29
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:29,185
Clear the area!
Let's set up a perimeter.

30
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,122
- And tell animal control I'll need that bone back.
- Right.

31
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,285
First thing I'll do
when they get here.

32
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,292
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>Victim was female, late teens.</i>

33
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,668
Blonde. Cause of death looks like
blunt trauma to the back of the skull.

34
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,970
- She was buried facedown.
- What's that, some satanic hoo-ha?

35
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:55,504
My Uncle Preston wants to be buried
standing up without a casket.

36
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:59,245
Pupal casings and insect remains suggest
she was buried out there seven to 10 years ago.

37
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,811
<i>Placement of wrists and ankles</i>
<i>suggest she was bound.</i>

38
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,858
<i>Residue on the medial malleolus</i>
<i>might tell us what restraints were used.</i>

39
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:10,328
- Look at that.
- Wear to her right lateral
epicondyle and rotator cuff.

40
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:13,854
<i>Also, repetitive motion damage</i>
<i>to the lower lumbar vertebrae.</i>

41
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,060
- What's that mean?
- Golf?

42
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,038
Hi, Angela.
You look great today.

43
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:24,008
Thanks, Hodgie.
This is my " boho, rocker, artist...

00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:32,540
Uh, I did a facial reconstruction...

47
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,179
extrapolating skin tone
from hair color.

48
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:38,053
<i>For the record, I hate</i>
<i>the guy who killed this girl...</i>

49
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,183
<i>and I hope to hell</i>
<i>he burns in all eternity.</i>

50
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,596
- That our victim?
- I found flecks of black enamel paint in the wound.

51
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,692
- Shape suggests a tire iron.
- Tire iron.

52
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,703
[Screams]

53
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:56,731
Tire iron.
Hands and feet bound, buried facedown.

54
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,608
Epps.

55
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,877
Hello?
New team member in the room.

56
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,043
Howard Epps,
a serial killer on death row.

57
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,781
- Killed at least three.
- We found two of'em last year.

58
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,824
<i>Thejudge stayed his execution</i>
<i>to try him on the new charges.</i>

59
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,382
You saved his life. Ironic.

60
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,088
<i>The time frame fits.</i>
<i>This girl would've been killed...</i>

61
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,791
about six months before
Epps went to prison.

62
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,835
- Run her through the database, get an I.D.
- Why don't you just ask him?

63
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:26,565
Because last time Bones saw Epps,
it got violent.

64
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,802
- You'll be there to protect her.
- <i>She's not the one who needs protecting.</i>

65
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,810
Bones broke his wrist.

66
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:38,473
He touched me with his creepy
serial killer hands.

67
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,076
Better not take Dr. Brennan.

68
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,180
<i>[Door Buzzing]</i>

69
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,020
Agent Booth.
What took you so long?

70
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,594
And where's Dr. Brennan?

71
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,180
Who's this?

72
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,716
Oh! That's right.

73
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,480
You're chained.
[Chuckles]

74
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,680
How about removing these shackles?

75
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,748
The name, Howie.
The name.

76
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:59,092
You know...

77
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:02,259
those hack doctors
at the prison infirmary...

78
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,701
did a miserable job
setting my wrist.

79
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,763
It aches all the time, and I don't have
a full range of movement.

80
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,936
And let me tell you, when you're stuck
in a prison cell for 23 hours a day...

81
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:15,037
there's really only one thing
you can do to pass the time.

82
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:18,550
And I need my wrist.

83
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:22,884
<i>Well, I'm sure Dr. Brennan</i>
<i>would be happy to re-break it for you.</i>

84
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,854
- <i>What's that?</i>
- <i>What, these?</i>

85
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:30,293
These are crime scene photos,
the ones you like.

86
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,422
<i>Tell you what.</i>
<i>You,</i> uh...

87
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:37,197
You tell me the girl's name,
I'll, uh, let you take a look.

88
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,467
Everything you need to win the game
is right there in front of you.

89
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,100
Game?
[Scoffs]

90
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,770
You're bored, huh?
Are you playing us?

91
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:50,111
When Dr. Brennan figures it out,
come and see me again.

92
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,208
But bring your lady scientist.

93
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,220
Otherwise, I don't say a word.

94
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,222
Next time you see
either one of us...

95
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,884
they'll be giving you
a lethal injection.

96
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:16,301
- Classic game theory.
Throwing down of the gauntlet.
- What?

97
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,072
Conflict of interest arises
followed by a series of moves...

98
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,909
- from which divergent strategies can be discerned.
- What did he say?

99
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,643
- Epps is playing us.
- Yes. That's exactly what I said.

100
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:28,483
Zero sum, obviously. After a few moves,
we'll know Epps's order of preference.

101
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,022
- What did he say?
- We'll find out what Epps wants.

102
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,115
<i>Look, I already know what he wants.</i>
<i>I told you.</i>

103
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,990
- He wants Bones sitting across the table from him.
- Three rational players.

104
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,623
- Me, Booth and Epps.
What about the nondeliberative agent?
- What did she say?

105
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,691
In a game, there tends to be
one "N" rational players...

106
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,260
and a nonconscious,
nondeliberative agent.

107
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:51,004
What did Epps talk about before he said all
the information you needed was in front of you?

108
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:55,013
Mom, Bones, blondes, his wrist
being set badly after Bones broke it.

109
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,777
And, um, you know, he...

110
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,377
<i>he made the point that</i>
<i>he really needed his wrist.</i>

111
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,790
Chronic masturbation.

112
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,794
The game may be all about
self-gratification.

113
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,797
The phrase he used was
"right in front of us."

114
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,959
- Yes.
- The blonde is right in front of us.

115
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,970
And she has a wrist.
Well, two, in fact.

116
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:23,532
- If you had a pet pig, what would you name him?
- Jasper.

117
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,668
- Oh.
- This wrist looks completely normal.

118
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:29,078
Here.
The right hamate bone.

119
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,582
Hamate?

120
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,245
The whole coloration is off.

121
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,084
It's slightly greasy compared
to the surrounding bone.

122
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:42,719
It's about an eighth of an inch bigger
than the same bone on the other side.

123
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,821
This hamate bone does not belong
with these remains.

124
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,025
It belongs with a second body.

125
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,898
There's another victim
out there somewhere.

126
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,606
Round one goes to Howard Epps.

127
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:59,077
- Why?
- Because he gets what he wants.

128
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,113
Me in the room with him.

129
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,048
- Who's that?
- Oh, that is, uh, Caroline Epps.

130
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:14,251
- Howard's sister?
- Uh, no.

131
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,352
- Howard's wife.
- Well, he didn't have a wife last year.

132
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,454
Well, they got married
about four months ago.

133
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,591
Heads up, Bones. It's our turn
to visit the psychotic murderous maniac...

134
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,895
Bastard.

135
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:27,030
Hi, Mrs. Epps.
I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth.

136
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:29,040
- This is Dr. Brennan.
- Oh, Agent Booth.

137
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,303
Howard's told me you both
saved his life last year.

138
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:34,369
- It was our pleasure.
- What? I was disappointed.

139
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,245
Extending Howard's life
has given him time...

140
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:41,650
to come to grips with what he's done...
to ask God for forgiveness.

141
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,053
Then we did the right thing
by having his execution stayed.

142
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,648
- Are you on some kind of medication?
- Bones.

143
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:50,628
Dr. Brennan, I'm not one of those crazy women
who falls in love with death row killers.

144
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,994
Obviously,
that's exactly what you are.

145
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:56,557
If the prison ever gives you a hard time
in coming to see your husband, give me a call.

146
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,160
- I might be able to help.
- Thank you, Agent Booth.

147
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,398
- Are you serious? She's crazy.
- Chop-chop. Let's go.

148
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,169
- Thank you. Nice to see you.
- Nice to meet you both.

149
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,143
- Why were you nice to her?
- Because we might need her.

150
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,238
Ah. Dr. Brennan.
You came.

151
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:14,309
I got your message.
We're analyzing the wrist bone right now.

152
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,185
We just met your wife.

153
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:20,316
- She seems very nice.
- Caroline's a hairdresser.

154

<i>[Door Buzzing]</i>

155
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,659
I'm glad you came.

156
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,164
I hope you come back
after you analyze the bone.

157
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,667
Caroline's the best
I could do in here.

158
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:34,104
Yeah, not your usual type, Howie.
I mean, not young, not blonde.

159
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,164
- Not dead.
- Bones, could you please shut up?

160
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,268
- Excuse me?
- Is this why you duct-tape their mouths?

161
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,109
Because <i>that</i> I understand.

162
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,679
That's the lamest attempt
at bonding I have ever seen.

163
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,622
[Sniffing]
You smell that?

164
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,856
What?
My stinky effort to bond?

165
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,058
Antiseptic.
My mother smelled like that.

166
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:04,796
Obsessed with germs.
She washed her hands with ammonia.

167
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,236
Mine too.

168
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,969
My one regret...
I didn't make her my first victim.

169
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:14,672
- Put her under a little stone cross years ago.
- Okay.

170
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,808
- "Okay" what?
- Okay.

171
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:22,877
- Okay.
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>

172
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:27,749
<i>Don't be mad at me, Bones.</i>
<i>My telling you to shut up was a ploy.</i>

173
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:31,024
- Now he thinks you're an idiot.
- Game theory, Bones, okay?

174
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:34,191
For two players to gain
advantage over the one...

175
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,200
they must be distinct
from each other.

176
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,669
- Where'd you get that?
- <i>From me. I suggested that you be the smart one.</i>

177
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:44,335
<i>Which, you know, left me making</i>
<i>a ploy that was supposed to be lame.</i>

178
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,004
- Don't enjoy this.
- What?

179
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,539
<i>The only reason I am playing his game is</i>
<i>to discover the identity of this young woman.</i>

180
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,847
<i>Well, we've made</i>
<i>no progress on that.</i>

181
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,444
Check the junior golf leagues.

182
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,320
Given the amount of wear
to her shoulder, elbow and spine...

183
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,122
she must've started golfing
at an early age.

184
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:05,755
I found minute traces of gypsum
and selenium on the mystery wrist bone.

185
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:09,392
<i>Also, phenolphthalein,</i>
<i>which is a kind oflaxative.</i>

186
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,459
Laxatives show up in bones?

187
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:14,028
No, not even after years of ingestion.

188
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:17,439
The laxative is on the surface of the bone.
l-I have no explanation.

189
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,776
We have scoured every inch of her,
X-rayed her, run her through an M.R.I.

190
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,943
- What clue are we missing?
- The laxative is the one thing that makes no sense.

191
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:30,148
<i>Last time, it was masturbation.</i>
<i>Did he reference bowel movements?</i>

192
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,315
He mentioned his mother
was a germophobe...

193
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:35,656
scrubbing his hands
with ammonia...

194
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:39,630
- Ammonia.
- Ammonia. Oh! Why didn't you say so?

195
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,724
Ammonia?

196
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,732
Booth thinks we should get together
and buy Brennan a pet.

197
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,797
- What kind of a pet?
- A pig.

198
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,308
And I don't think he means a guinea pig.
A real pig.

199
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,641
Like a Mulefoot, Saddleback,
or pot belly.

200
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,547
<i>You wanna expose a piece of</i>
<i>crucial evidence to ammonia gas? No.</i>

201
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:01,575
Besides being a laxative,
phenolphthalein is a sensitive pH indicator.

202
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,588
Colorless unless
it's exposed to ammonia.

203
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:07,114
The second you expose this bone, it's useless.
Epps wants you to destroy evidence.

204
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,354
Why would he want us
to destroy evidence he planted?

205
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,123
Why would he plant
evidence at all?

206
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,257
It might be a win-win
scenario for him.

207
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,995
<i>lfhis endgame is to disorient</i>
<i>Dr. Brennan, he can do that...</i>

208
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,264
by ruining evidence
that he himself planted.

209
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,829
Fine.
You can perform the experiment.

210
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,365
So, glasses.

211
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:42,191
- <i>[Saroyan] What is that?</i>
- Not sure.

212
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,003
A Freemason symbol?

213
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:56,803
Hey, this explains
the "buried facedown" thing.

214
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,707
Oh, it's all starting
to come together.

215
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,771
<i>These crossed hammers prove that Epps is</i>
<i>working for the top level of the Illuminati.</i>

216
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,839
That's the cartographic symbol
for a mine.

217
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,686
Oh.

218
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,746
Epps is telling us that the second victim's
in a mine? What kind of mine?

219
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,816
One that contains
gypsum and selenium.

220
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,692
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>In prison, Epps mentioned a stone cross.</i>

221
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,700
<i>That's what we should</i>
<i>be looking for inside.</i>

222
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:26,260
Okay. This is the only
abandoned gypsum mine...

223
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,171
within Epps's known killing ground
to also contain selenium.

224
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:32,540
Six entrances, hundreds of shafts,
and half of it's flooded.

225
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:36,707
All right. You just follow my lead and
watch yourself in there, okay? Thank you.

226
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,012
I don't think Epps would
make it that hard for us.

227
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,917
Yeah, well, Epps said he wished
he'd buried his mother under a stone cross.

228
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,514
I bet <i>that</i> is a hint.
Okay, people, listen up!

229
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,025
- I'm calling in a "splunking" team.
- Spelunking.

230
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:51,893
Spelunking team with imaging capabilities
to look for a stone cross.

231
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:55,491
Until they get here,
let's focus on the ventilation shafts...

232
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,695
Hold on...
to the west of the main shafts...

233
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,797
What? Oh.
Never mind.

234
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:07,510
Can we get some light
down this shaft, please?

235
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,607
- <i>It's the cross, Booth.</i>
- That is, uh, definitely a cross.

236
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,618
- Will you help me move these?
- Move what?

237
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:17,383
- The rocks.
- [Grunts]

238
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,456
Bones! Oh!

239
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,260
<i>Oh!</i>
<i>[Sighs]</i>

240
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,166
Well, it's definitely human, but...

241
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,397
- What?
- Well, Cam can be more precise...

242
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,701
but I don't think
this is more than a week old.

243
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,003
Epps has been in prison
for seven years...

244
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:40,568
<i>which means he has an accomplice</i>
<i>killing people...</i>

245
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,706
on the outside.

246
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,273
God, I wonder
how many more there are.

247
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,922
This is where
the hamate bone was taken.

248
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:57,087
The victim is female, mid-teens.

249
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:00,097
Extensive contusions
around the ankles.

250
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:03,362
Yes, and bone damage too.

251
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:07,565
<i>Hip displacement,</i>
<i>elongation of the spine.</i>

252
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,475
[Screams]

253
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,011
- He hung her upside down.
- <i>I agree.</i>

254
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,776
And while she was still alive too.
Is that part of Epps's M. O?

255
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,616
- No.
- So his accomplice threw in some flair of his own.

256
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,212
Nine years ago,
Epps killed someone and buries her.

257
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,349
He goes to jail seven years ago.

258
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,859
Last week,
his accomplice kills another girl...

259
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,989
<i>and swapped wrist bones with</i>
<i>the girl Epps buried nine years ago.</i>

260
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,397
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>How do they communicate?</i>

261
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:39,563
<i>Inmates are allowed phone calls,</i>
<i>visitors, letters.</i>

262
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,299
- <i>But those are all monitored.</i>
- He has a wife.

263
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:45,173
Look at this. It's a burn.
Cigarette, probably.

264
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,145
<i>And there's this.</i>

265
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,349
It was jammed in her shoe.

266
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,544
What? She wasn't wearing it?

267
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,549
The, uh, mine victim's dental work...

268
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:02,583
<i>identifies her as Sarah Koskoff,</i>
<i>Bethesda, Maryland.</i>

269
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,856
<i>Disappeared three weeks ago.</i>

270
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,831
- <i>Sixteen years old.</i>
- Sarah Koskoff.

271
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,529
<i>She fits Epps's victim profile perfectly.</i>

272
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,665
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

273
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,939
- Brennan.
- [Booth] Yeah, Bones, it's me.

274
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,946
Listen, I talked to
Sarah Koskoff's parents.

275
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:26,075
They said her dream was to own her own beauty
shop. She worked for a hair salon in the city.

276
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,915
- Don't tell me.
- Yep. "M" Salon, Cleveland Park.

277
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,617
- Owned by Caroline Mapother.
- Now known as Caroline Epps.

278
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:36,889
You know, you remember when I was
nice to her and you weren't? This is why.

279
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,953
Thank you.

280
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,430
<i>Hi.</i>

281
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,300
Hi.

282
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,840
- Is-Is Howard okay?
- Howard's fine, Mrs. Epps.

283
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,841
You don't have
to worry about anything.

284
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,605
I couldn't help but notice
the "Help Wanted" sign in the window.

285
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,772
<i>Did you recently lose</i>
<i>one of your employees?</i>

286
00:16:55,848 --> 00:17:01,445
It's, uh, hard to keep help

287
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,047
Sarah Koskoff steal from you?

288
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,992
No. Why?
What did she do?

289
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,052
She died.

290
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,631
You know, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to ask you...

291
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,465
but when was the last time
you saw her?

292
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,028
Uh, three weeks ago.

293
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:24,473
She just stopped coming to work.
She... She died?

294
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,639
Did you ever, uh, talk
to Howard about her?

295
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,275
- Uh, I don't know. Maybe.
- Howard ever see a picture of Sarah?

296
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:35,184
l-I don't like this.
What's going on?

297
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:39,691
She was found buried facedown
in an abandoned mine.

298
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:44,661
Back of her head bashed in,
wrists, ankles tied.

299
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,198
Your husband's M.O.

300
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:53,694
Poor Sarah.
But Howard...

301
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:58,610
Howard has been in prison
for the last seven years.

302
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,975
How could he kill anyone?

303
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,207
He has an accomplice.

304
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,877
- You think it's me?
- You love your husband.

305
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:10,149
I love the good in Howard.

306
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:14,886
I reject the evil.
We're going to have a child together.

307
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,793
I've petitioned the court
to let Howard donate.

308
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,728
Yeah.
[Clears Throat]

309
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:23,734
I have a search warrant here
for your home and your shop.

310
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,861
You don't need a search warrant.

311
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:31,399
You can look anywhere you want,
because you won't find anything.

312
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:39,083
<i>[Booth] Sarah Koskoff was hung</i>
<i>upside down before she was killed.</i>

313
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,381
That suggests the torture route.

314
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:46,516
And I was hoping it was in
the basement of a beauty salon.

315
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,152
<i>But, uh, my agents,</i>
<i>they didn't find anything.</i>

316
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,026
- What's that?
- Religious medal.

317
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:55,863
- Sarah had it in her possession.
- Saint Agnes.

318
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:59,927
Patron saint of young women...

319
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,870
especially those
who remain pure.

320
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,033
How do you know all that?

321
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,202
I'm Catholic, Bones.

322
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,842
- "S.A.H.S."
- Yeah, St. Agnes High School.

323
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:17,854
Except I think Sarah Koskoff
went to public school. Oh, God.

324
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,084
What?
What does that mean?

325
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,526
It means I have to go talk to a nun.

326
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:27,497
<i>We have no student at St. Agnes</i>
<i>named Sarah Koskoff.</i>

327
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,296
Maybe she's a friend
of one of your girls.

328
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,361
As soon as you called me last night...

329
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:37,465
we implemented a telephone tree
asking precisely that question.

330
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,943
- No response.
- Do the names Howard Epps...

331
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,947
Caroline Epps, Caroline Mapother
mean anything to you?

332
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,575
May I have the keyboard?

333
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:48,950
Yes, Sister. Yeah, of course. Here.
[Chuckles]

334
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,619
I need to enter a password.

335
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,388
Oh, yeah.
I'll be right over here.

336
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,258
I'm Catholic.

337
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,992
l-I go to mass every Sunday.

338
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:05,298
Well, almost every Sunday.
I'm very trustworthy.

339
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,998
<i>Nobody by any of those names.</i>

340
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:11,600
I feel that I have been very patient...

341
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:15,511
in regard
to not asking what this is about.

342
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,482
Oh, yeah.
Murder victim.

343
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:23,010
Ayoung girl was found
with this religious medal.

344
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,423
Helen Majors.

345
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,157
Helen Majors?
Who's that?

346
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,792
This golden medal...

347
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,700
is given to the Holy Spirit Award winner
every year.

348
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,763
<i>I presented this medal</i>
<i>to Helen Majors myself.</i>

349
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:47,039
May we please see Helen Majors?
Talk to her?

350
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:51,879
<i>Helen left school three days ago.</i>
<i>No one has seen her since.</i>

351
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,687
Three days ago,
Helen had that medal.

352
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,054
Yesterday, we found it with
Sarah Koskoff's dead body.

353
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,990
It's possible Helen is still alive.

354
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,960
- We have Caroline Epps under surveillance.
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

355
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,054
- I hate this.
- All right.

356
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:11,125
- Booth.
- I don't want to find that girl's
remains in some mine, Booth.

357
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,569
Reiner Hatin?
Address.

358
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:17,166
7408 Haskell Street, Cleveland Park.

359
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,836
Uh, 22705 to Control.

360
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:23,540
I'm en route to possible
H.R.T. incident at 7408 Haskell Street.

361
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,482
- Requesting backup.
- <i>[Man On Radio] Affirmative, 22705.</i>

362
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,576
- <i>7408 Haskell.</i>
- What?

363
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,452
Epps's prison letters log
show in the last year...

364
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:34,981
he wrote six letters to a man by the name
of Reiner Hatin at that address.

365
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,052
Caroline Epps might not be
Epps's accomplice after all.

366
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,928
- What are you doing?
- Where's the siren on this thing?

367
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,490
- Don't touch...
- <i>[Siren Wailing]</i>

368
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,868
- Okay, Bones, I'm going in.
You're gonna wait outside.
- Booth...

369
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:55,902
No, I don't wanna hear it. When backup arrives,
tell 'em there's a federal agent inside.

370
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,142
- Which one is it?
- [Clears Throat]

371
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:03,552
- <i>[Sirens Wailing]</i>
- Great. A vacant lot.

372
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,749
I tried to tell you.

373
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,287
<i>[Door Buzzing]</i>

374
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:16,391
Did you hear?
I'm gonna be a father.

375
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:19,266
The judge granted our petition
for artificial insemination.

376
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:26,202
When I make my donation to the baby bank,
I'm gonna be thinking about you.

377
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:30,510
- Who's Reiner Hatin?
- Oh, Reiner.

378
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,914
[Speaking German]

379
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:35,248
<i>The letters were addressed</i>
<i>to a vacant lot.</i>

380
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,654
<i>I must've written the address down wrong.</i>
<i>I'm slightly dyslexic, you know.</i>

381
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:44,662
Hey, come here. You know,
I really enjoyed playing your game.

382
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,221
Now, you know what?
There is a girl out there...

383
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,631
hanging upside down
with duct tape over her mouth!

384
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:53,933
<i>Booth, let him go.</i>
<i>Let him go!</i>

385
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:01,304
For all your faults, Mr. Epps...

386
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,349
you were never interested
in letting your victims suffer.

387
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,852
You didn't torture them.
You're not that kind of man.

388
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,919
She's an innocent child.

389
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:15,789
She's a young woman...

390
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:19,524
and there's no such thing
as an innocent woman.

391
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:24,463
Look within yourself.
You know I'm right.

392
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:28,063
You know, I'm just guessing here,
you understand, but I think you'll find that...

393
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,507
Helen Majors has less
than 24 hours to live.

394
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,006
Better get going.

395
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,446
Sorry.

396
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,288
[Laughing]

397
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:59,296
- What are you asking me for?
- You said you've dealt with
manipulative men before.

398
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,805
Sweetie, this is a psycho killer...

399
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:05,673
not some loser who wants you
to cosign a loan for his Jet Ski.

400
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:10,545
Epps is pushing me around, Ange.
He's in control. I hate that.

401
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,448
<i>You know...</i>

402
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:16,009
Epps is acting
kind of like a boyfriend.

403
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,317
[Chuckles]
What?

404
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,154
Well, you obviously fascinate him.

405
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:24,195
He can't have you,
and he can't kill you.

406
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:27,663
- So he wants to make you hate yourself.
- God, Ange.

407
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,996
What kind of boyfriends
have you had?

408
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,866
Let's keep the focus
on you and Epps, okay?

409
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,769
Okay.

410
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,365
Epps knows that you'll
never forgive yourself...

411
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,603
<i>if you don't find Helen Majors</i>
<i>before she's murdered.</i>

412
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:45,378
Not only is Helen being tortured,
but her family must be in agony.

413
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:49,409
You see?
This is what he's doing.

414
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,422
He's putting pictures
in your mind.

415
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,981
He's messing with
your objectivity.

416
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,357
There's nothing
I can do about that.

417
00:24:56,428 --> 00:25:01,422
You have to step back, okay?
Let the rest of us deal with the families.

418
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,733
You find Helen. That'll keep Epps
from getting a Jet Ski outta you.

419
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:14,044
Bones. Caroline Epps...
not an accomplice.

420
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:19,550
- She was at work when
Helen Majors was kidnapped.
- [Speaking German]

421
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:24,885
- Yeah, whatever.
- It means " old friend with
similar tastes" in German.

422
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:27,015
Oh, no. Epps telling us
the name of his accomplice?

423
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:30,391
- That's too easy.
- Well, if it's too easy, then why can't we find him?

424
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,397
You know what?
He talked about impregnating Caroline.

425
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:38,266
What is with Caroline Epps? I mean,
why have a child with a monster like him?

426
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:41,863
What is she gonna tell the child when it
grows up? "Hi. Your daddy's a monster."

427
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,340
Look. Time out.
You gotta detach from this, all right?

428
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:47,435
- We let Epps get under our skin,
it's exactly what he wants.
- Zack was right.

429
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:52,040
Epps is trying to break us. Not only
did we save his life, but he is still killing.

430
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,051
I found traces of ethylene oxide...

431
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,644
and high levels of an antibacterial agent
on Sarah's ankles.

432
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,884
Also, polymer residue found in
Polygenex latex glove liners...

433
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,983
used by people who handle
toxic substances.

434
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,153
- Airport screeners, cops...
- Wait. Prison guards?

435
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,494
Lauren Hathaway was a nationally ranked
junior golfer in 1997.

436
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,591
<i>Yeah, it's Booth.</i>
<i>I need to know if Howard Epps...</i>

437
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:12,102
ever had a prison guard
by the name of Reiner Hatin.

438
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,797
She disappeared on May 9...

439
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:17,103
<i>after leaving the Southampton Country Club</i>
<i>in Raleigh, North Carolina.</i>

440
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:20,008
Check and see if
any guard changed his name.

441
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,343
"Reiner" is German for "pure."
Epps has a thing about that.

442
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,680
Translate the name and see if that comes back
in any form. Then get back to me.

443
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,811
- This the victim from the park?
- Her father is in your office.

444
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,856
- What?
- Why didn't you say that?

445
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:35,723
- You were on the phone.
- Booth.

446
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:38,319
I can't do this one.

447
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:40,660
Maybe Angela can help.

448
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,667
All right.
I'll take care of it.

449
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,941
My wife died five years
after Lauren disappeared.

450
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:56,845
I think because
she just gave up hope.

451
00:26:56,915 --> 00:27:00,544
Part of me is glad
she's not here today for this.

452
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:05,181
We're sorry for your loss, Mr. Hathaway.
For both your losses.

453
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:08,748
<i>When Lauren disappeared, the police</i>
<i>originally suspected her golf coach.</i>

454
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:12,820
Yes. He'd had an affair with
one of his students the year before.

455
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:15,764
Ironically, his alibi was that
he was with another student.

456
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:20,430
- Does the name Reiner Hatin
mean anything to you?
- No.

457
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,496
Do you recognize this man?

458
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:29,741
No.
I'm not helping, am I?

459
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,942
That photograph is current.
Here are some drawings that show...

460
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:36,010
what he might've looked like
10 years ago.

461
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,085
Mmm.

462
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,263
Yes. That one.

463
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:51,598
He was a greenskeeper at the club.
He helped us load the car one day.

464
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,299
I remember because he told Lauren she looked
just like his mother when she was young.

465
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:57,773
It was an odd thing to say.

466
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:01,869
I told the police about it when she
disappeared. Why didn't they arrest him?

467
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,180
<i>Caroline Epps.</i>
<i>She knows something.</i>

468
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,348
- She just won't talk to me.
- Why?

469
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,723
- I'm a man last time I checked.
- But she'll talk to a woman?

470
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,785
- That's my thinking.
- Fine. I'll do it.

471
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,626
Oh, no. You can't sarcasm it out of her.
You have to connect.

472
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,361
- You don't wanna send Brennan?
- No. Angela.

473
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:26,165
Angela's an artist,
an expert in 3-D reconstruction.

474
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:30,230
- Well, unlike you and Bones, Angela is, uh...
- What?

475
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,242
She's better with the living
than she is the dead.

476
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:36,440
- Fine. I'll go tell her
what she's just volunteered for.
- Thank you.

477
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,885
Thanks for coming.

478
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:46,652
I've told your people everything I know.
I don't see the point of this.

479
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,593
I know this is disturbing.
lfind it very upsetting...

480
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:53,529
and I'm not married
to the man who did it.

481
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:56,123
I love Howard,
Miss Montenegro.

482
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,135
I believe you.

483
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:01,263
No one's ever said that to me.

484
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:05,639
I think you'd have to love him very much
to be willing to overlook what he's done.

485
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,337
Done in the past.

486
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:13,282
The thing is, we're not so sure
that it was in the past.

487
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:17,845
<i>For Howard,</i>
<i>it's obvious what he likes.</i>

488
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:21,449
- Blonde girls.
- Not me, you mean.

489
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:25,826
Men can't hide what they like.
For Howard, it's this.

490
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,730
Men can change
what they look at.

491
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,897
Does Howard ever just look at you as though
you just feel his eyes adoring you?

492
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:38,942
He...

493
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:43,379
He asks for magazines, DVDs.

494
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,542
He's... He's very specific.

495
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,382
He likes blonde girls.

496
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,912
[Chuckles]
Always the blonde girls.

497
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,852
M-Maybe if I...
if I dyed my hair...

498
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,498
I'm sorry.
I have to ask you something.

499
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,730
Have you ever delivered
any messages for Howard?

500
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,765
- Don't you miss them?
- I'm sorry?

501
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:17,042
I wrote the message
"Don't you miss them?"...

502
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:20,607
on a... on a... on a piece of paper
and slipped it into a mailbox.

503
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:23,119
Whose mailbox?

504
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:28,353
Um, a man named Henry Gerber
who Howard knew from prison.

505
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:32,692
<i>Howard calls Henry "The Mad German."</i>

506
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:35,289
When did you deliver the message?

507
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,801
F... Five days ago.

508
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,862
Thank you.

509
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,567
Can... Can...

510
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:48,044
<i>Will you sit with me</i>
<i>just a moment longer?</i>

511
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:52,811
I'm... I have to make a phone call.
You understand?

512
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:57,787
But after that,
I'll sit with you as long as you like.

513
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:11,157
- F.B.I. Hands in the air. That's it.
- <i>[Woman Moaning On TV]</i>

514
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:15,332
Now move over there slowly.
Ah! Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

515
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,738
- I can't do both.
- Booth.

516
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,776
<i>Easy.</i>

517
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:25,680
<i>[Moaning On TVContinues]</i>

518
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,151
- Where's Henry Gerber?
- I'm Henry Gerber.

519
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:40,794
There is no way a man in a wheelchair
could have killed Sarah Koskoff...

520
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:44,665
or swapped hamate bones
with Lauren Hathaway.

521
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,500
All right, Epps got us again, huh?
Gerber's paralyzed from the waist down...

522
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:51,633
because Epps knifed him
just before he was paroled.

523
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:55,543
<i>So, what? His message</i>
<i>"Don't you miss them?" meant what, his legs?</i>

524
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:59,105
Epps is good.
Not morally, of course.

525
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:03,483
But it's a classic feint-and-parry misdirect
delivered via his wife.

526
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:06,284
He gets off on screwing
with people's lives.

527
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,382
- Where are we on Reiner Hatin?
- Nowhere.

528
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:12,793
I had some thoughts. Perhaps the point
isn't that German is a different language...

529
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,798
but that it's actually
a different language.

530
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:18,063
- Great. Thanks, Zack, for being so helpful.
- Go on.

531
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:23,699
More broadly speaking, I mean, like
an anagram or an inner or secret language.

532
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:27,176
<i>These are phrases I found in English.</i>
<i>Perhaps in German...</i>

533
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,645
No, the whole German thing was a ruse.
If it's anywhere, it's here.

534
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:33,343
<i>"Rant Herein I."</i>
<i>You know, like inner schizophrenic voices.</i>

535
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,477
<i>"A re Inner Hit" could mean...</i>

536
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:38,420
I don't really do
the poetry thing.

537
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:42,823
"Neither Rain." No.
"Neither rain nor sleet nor dead of night."

538
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:46,728
- The postal service motto.
- Hey, the guy's all about sending messages.

539
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,595
Mail to an empty lot.
Messages dropped in mail slots.

540
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,100
Postal workers wear
Polygenex gloves.

541
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:57,039
Who received the letters
Epps sent to that empty lot?

542
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:00,509
[Man] Letters with an invalid address and
no return address go to the dead letter office.

543
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:04,275
- Who has access?
- <i>Uh, sorting staff and the</i>
<i>mail carrier for that route.</i>

544
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:09,252
Stream us a route which includes
7408 Haskell Street, Cleveland Park, right?

545
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,847
<i>Yes. But there is no</i>
<i>7408 Haskell Street.</i>

546
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,915
Got it.

547
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:19,293
<i>Hey, that's Caroline Epps's beauty salon.</i>

548
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,855
That's St. Agnes High School.

549
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,992
The killer picked his victims
from a postal route.

550
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:27,231
- Tell us the name of the mail carrier.
- <i>I can do better than that.</i>

551
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:31,469
<i>All I ask is that when this goes to the press,</i>
<i>nobody uses the word "disgruntled."</i>

552
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,773
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>He's never done anything like this.</i>

553
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,780
- Booth.
- Yeah, I got him.

554
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,716
- What?
- That's the guy who found the first body.

555
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:44,744
Found it because he knew
where it was buried. Let's go.

556
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:46,949
- <i>[Barking]</i>
- Oh!

557
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,289
<i>Whoa.</i>

558
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,555
Oh, great. Him again.
I'll need a pinecone.

wall of death.

564
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:16,419
This is Sarah Koskoff.

565
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:21,652
- Helen Majors.
- <i>They were so young, so innocent.</i>

566
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,285
And Lauren Hathaway.

567
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:28,764
<i>Southampton Country Club.</i>
<i>That's where Epps and his accomplice met.</i>

- <i>[Hodgins On Phone] Yeah?</i>

571
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,835
Hodgins, it's me. Is there anything you can
tell us about where Sarah Koskoff was held...

572
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,175
before her body was
dumped in the gypsum mine?

573
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:46,512
The only substance I can't explain
is ethylene oxide.

574
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,678
What about the ethylene oxide
plus the antibacterial agents?

575
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,222
It could be a lot of things.

576
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,384
<i>I'll set up a statistical model,</i>
<i>give you four or five scenarios.</i>

577
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,122
There is no time.
A girl's life is at stake here.

578
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,960
<i>Just give me</i>
<i>your best guess right now.</i>

579
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,523
I can't just guess!
I have a process!

580
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:07,503
<i>What if I guess and the girl dies?</i>

581
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:11,565
- No. No way!
- <i>All right. Just simmer down, Hodgins.</i>

582
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:14,304
<i>We're all just trying to do our best</i>
<i>in this situation right now.</i>

583
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:17,506
- Jack.
- Hodgins, are you still there?

584
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:21,518
Hey.
Pretend it's me asking, okay?

585
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:25,181
Look, we're just exchanging theories here
at work like always.

586
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:29,124
Two substances, right?
Put them in the same place at the same time.

587
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:32,321
- Either they mean something or they don't.
- Hodgins, you there, buddy?

588
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:36,230
- Yeah. Just give me a second, please.
- We don't have a second.

589
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,100
Booth, do you think you could just
stop talking, please?

590
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,567
Okay. All right.
Uh, antibacterial agents.

591
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,838
<i>And, uh,</i> he...
<i>He's a postal worker.</i>

592
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,743
- Okay.
- Uh...

593
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,612
What else, Jack?

594
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:56,578
- Anthrax.
- Anthrax?

595
00:35:56,654 --> 00:36:01,682
After the anthrax attacks in 2001,
the post office shut down several sorting centers.

596
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,590
Okay.
All right.

597
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,458
Tell <i>me.</i>

598
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:09,091
Uh, they used ethylene oxide
and this antibacterial agent to...

599
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,727
That's how they cleaned 'em.
Not all of'em reopened.

600
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:15,135
So it's possible Sarah was kept
at an abandoned sorting center?

601
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,037
Yes.

602
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,071
Yes, it is.

603
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:22,135
I knew you'd come through for me, buddy.
Good work.

604
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:26,877
Whew.

00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,253

Yeah, well,
