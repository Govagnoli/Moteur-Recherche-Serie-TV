1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,700
I read, walked on the beach, chilled.

2
00:00:03,701 --> 00:00:05,300
Oh, you chilled, in Darfur.

3
00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:07,700
- You chilled in Darfur?
- In North Carolina.

4
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:10,300
I changed my vacation plans
to spend time with my brother.

5
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,900
Ross and I talked about it and we
really wanna find dad.

6
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:15,600
Okay, well, just so you know, the FBI's
gonna find your father,

7
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:16,900
no matter what you want.

8
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:20,100
My brother and i don't want the FBI
to backburner the search.

9
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:24,405
Is it okay to go over
on two wheels like that?

10
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:26,600
Only when making very sharp
turns at high speeds.

11
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:30,207
Hey, Bones, why don't you have
a little, uh, you know, faith in me, okay?

12
00:00:30,207 --> 00:00:32,103
I'm not gonna backburner the case.
All right?

13
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:34,803
- I'm gonna find your father.
- My brother said you'd say that.

14
00:00:34,808 --> 00:00:36,501
You really keep saying "my brother" a lot.

15
00:00:36,508 --> 00:00:38,601
Well, I lost ross for 15 years.

16
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:40,400
I like the sound of it.

17
00:00:41,406 --> 00:00:42,601
My brother.

18
00:00:44,908 --> 00:00:46,202
What's with the siren?

19
00:00:46,206 --> 00:00:48,402
Why are you driving
like a maniac?

20
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:08,900
Two passenger cars off the tracks.

21
00:01:08,908 --> 00:01:10,403
One on the side.

22
00:01:10,407 --> 00:01:12,001
There's gonna be fatalities.

23
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,801
Stan! I need some gauze!

24
00:01:15,206 --> 00:01:16,402
Danny!

25
00:01:16,408 --> 00:01:19,302
You don't find the owner of this in
the next ten minutes, he'll bleed to death.

26
00:01:19,308 --> 00:01:21,800
Starting... now.

27
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:25,503
- Seeley
- Camille

28
00:01:25,606 --> 00:01:27,600
- Don't call me Camille.
- Don't call me Seeley

29
00:01:27,608 --> 00:01:29,403
Dr. Brennan.
Dr. Saroyan.

30
00:01:29,415 --> 00:01:31,001
You two know
each other, right?

31
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,502
- No.
- No.

32
00:01:34,306 --> 00:01:36,400
Dr. Brennan, I'd like you
to check out the automobile

33
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:38,602
this train hit; It's probably
what caused the derailment.

34
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:39,703
Accidental?

35
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:43,403
NTSB guy says the train struck a car
at least 200 yards from the nearest access.

36
00:01:43,408 --> 00:01:44,801
Deliberate?

37
00:01:44,807 --> 00:01:46,202
Eight minutes, Steve!

38
00:01:46,508 --> 00:01:47,802
Probably suicide.

39
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:51,200
Why are you still here, Dr. Brennan?

40
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:54,401
Because I'm not a coroner,
and I don't work for you.

41
00:01:54,407 --> 00:01:56,001
Well, you got that half right.

42
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,402
Dr. Cam
Still breathing!

43
00:01:59,407 --> 00:02:01,500
Thanks, Steve! All right.

44
00:02:01,608 --> 00:02:04,103
Every survivor is one less
person for me to autopsy.

45
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:07,703
You look good out of your suit, Seeley.

46
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,402
But then, you always did.

47
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:11,003
Yeah. That'S...

48
00:02:11,408 --> 00:02:13,503
great to have you back in D.C. Camille.

49
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:15,902
One minute she's holding a severed arm,

50
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,103
the next she's hitting on you.

51
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:20,103
No, she wasn't hitting on me,
and you know what?

52
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:23,500
- She is your boss, Bones.
- No, Goodman's my boss.

53
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:25,903
- May I approach?
- All yours, Dr. Brandon.

54
00:02:25,908 --> 00:02:27,801
Brennan. Dr. Brennan.

55
00:02:27,808 --> 00:02:29,303
You want to guess my name?

56
00:02:29,305 --> 00:02:32,600
No, but there are thousands of you
in D.C. And only one of me.

57
00:02:32,805 --> 00:02:34,801
You know, while you were away, Goodman
decided that there should be

58
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:36,501
a head of forensics at the Jeffersonian.

59
00:02:36,508 --> 00:02:38,503
It never occurred to you
to check in, huh?

60
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:39,900
Why didn't Goodman hire me?

61
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:41,200
Oh, my guess; People skills.

62
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,702
You know, I have people skills.

63
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,702
Aw, all right.
That firefighter's name is Nelson.

64
00:02:44,705 --> 00:02:47,103
It's at least the fourth time
that you've met him.

65
00:02:47,108 --> 00:02:50,200
Odds are Cam knows his kids'
names after meeting him once.

66
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,602
A lot of jewelry.
Male.

67
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:55,000
Thigh bone suggests he was tall.

68
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:56,300
An I.D. Bracelet.

69
00:02:56,305 --> 00:03:00,003
It's good quality gold,
slightly melted.

70
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:04,800
Too melted for a regular car fire.

71
00:03:04,805 --> 00:03:06,102
Do you see a skull?

72
00:03:06,105 --> 00:03:07,802
Okay, Bones, I'm not looking for a skull.

73
00:03:07,808 --> 00:03:11,302
Burn damage in the body is more intense
than I'd expect from a car fire

74
00:03:11,306 --> 00:03:15,201
even if the fuel tank ruptured and
was absolutely full at the time of impact.

75
00:03:15,206 --> 00:03:17,400
Oh, I don't know. Do you see anything
on this car that isn't ruptured?

76
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:19,803
Booth, three deaths
in the first-class car.

77
00:03:19,805 --> 00:03:21,201
Oh, homicide.

78
00:03:21,306 --> 00:03:22,701
That makes it my case.

79
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:23,900
One of them's a senator.

80
00:03:23,906 --> 00:03:25,001
That makes a difference?

81
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:26,903
Facts of life, Bones.

82
00:03:34,008 --> 00:03:36,902
Apparently cam is autopsying a senator.

83
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:39,402
A senator? Oh, we're moving up in the world.

84
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:40,701
They have a past.

85
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,003
Cam and the senator?

86
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:43,602
Cam and Booth.

87
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,002
Look how she touches his arm
when he laughs.

88
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:48,201
You touch my arm
when I laugh.

89
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,200
No, you touch me.
It's a big difference.

90
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,100
Okay, what do we got?

91
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:58,100
Male, 40's,approximately
six foot seven, right-handed.

92
00:03:58,108 --> 00:03:59,500
Six foot seven?

93
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:01,902
Athlete in his youth.

94
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,502
Right shoulder is worn
from a repetitive motion.

95
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:05,800
Baseball pitcher maybe.

96
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:08,101
More like a...
basketball.

97
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:08,902
Basketball.

98
00:04:08,908 --> 00:04:11,303
Mm, six foot seven;
It makes sense.

99
00:04:11,305 --> 00:04:13,203
Every bone in his body is broken.

100
00:04:13,205 --> 00:04:15,103
Dude, he got hit by a train.

101
00:04:16,307 --> 00:04:17,502
"W-A-R."

102
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,302
It's all I can make out of one name.

103
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:21,500
And then, "love, briana."

104
00:04:22,705 --> 00:04:23,502
Dude!

105
00:04:23,507 --> 00:04:25,103
You're saying "dude" way too much.

106
00:04:25,106 --> 00:04:29,301
Forties, six foot seven, w-a-r, briana?

107
00:04:30,307 --> 00:04:32,302
This is Warren Lynch.

108
00:04:32,408 --> 00:04:33,900
Who's Warren Lynch?

109
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:34,700
No way.

110
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:35,803
Warren Lynch?

111
00:04:35,806 --> 00:04:38,402
- Lynchpin international Warren Lynch?
- Yeah.

112
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:41,100
I am not telling the press that
Warren Lynch killed Senator Paula Davis

113
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:42,700
before we're completely certain.

114
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:43,903
I know Senator Davis.

115
00:04:43,906 --> 00:04:46,203
I signed a book for her
to give to her daughter.

116
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,202
Oh, man, I love Paula Davis.

117
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:49,601
She could of been president.

118
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:53,001
Warren Lynch and senator Davis
killed in one accident?

119
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:54,900
No way it's a coincidence.

120
00:04:54,905 --> 00:04:56,902
Hey, Hodgepodge: All engines reverse.

121
00:04:56,908 --> 00:04:59,803
First we identify beyond the shadow
of a doubt, then we get paranoid.

122
00:04:59,806 --> 00:05:03,300
I'm cool. As long as paranoia
is on the schedule somewhere.

123
00:05:03,606 --> 00:05:04,901
It wasn't suicide.

124
00:05:04,907 --> 00:05:06,900
Jagged edges to the breaks.

125
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:11,800
Small fragments, a lack of circular
or radiating fractures, or adherent spurs.

126
00:05:11,808 --> 00:05:12,903
What does that mean?

127
00:05:12,907 --> 00:05:14,901
This man was dead for several hours

128
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:16,502
before the train hit him.

132
00:05:57,705 --> 00:05:59,601
We are tighter than a nun's
knees on this one.

133
00:05:59,607 --> 00:06:02,103
No press, no conjecture
with anyone outside this room.

134
00:06:02,106 --> 00:06:03,000
Why?

135
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:05,800
Because we are gonna
find the details of Senator Davis's death

136
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:08,103
without giving Oliver Stone
or Michael Moore any ideas.

137
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:11,303
Are we assuming senator Davis's death
was a coincidence?

138
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:13,803
You want to kill someone,
planting yourself in front of a train,

139
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,001
probably not the best idea.

140
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,400
But, too early to make any assumptions.

141
00:06:18,407 --> 00:06:20,103
I am a diuretic seagull, people.

142
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:21,202
Everything goes through me.

143
00:06:21,205 --> 00:06:22,001
10:00 A.M.?

144
00:06:22,002 --> 00:06:23,509
Here? Tomorrow?

145
00:06:23,907 --> 00:06:26,003
Zacharoni, your turn
to bring the doughnuts.

146
00:06:27,806 --> 00:06:29,103
Zacharoni?

147
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:32,601
Cam noticed that I eat macaroni
and cheese everyday at lunch.

148
00:06:32,606 --> 00:06:34,600
- Every single day?
- Yeah.

149
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:37,203
You should be okay with Dr. Saroyan

150
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:38,800
getting the head-of-forensics job.

151
00:06:39,508 --> 00:06:40,403
Why is that?

152
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:44,303
Because you are a strictly
rubber-to-the-road, hardball scientist.

153
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:46,402
You're not a flesh-pressing,

154
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,500
ink-stained,policy-making, wank-tard.

155
00:06:49,505 --> 00:06:51,001
What are her qualifications?

156
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:53,101
Chief coroner of New York for two years,

157
00:06:53,105 --> 00:06:55,203
assistant federal coroner before that.

158
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:57,900
How am I doing?

159
00:06:58,106 --> 00:06:59,900
Very well. Impressive.

160
00:07:01,206 --> 00:07:02,000
Brennan.

161
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,301
We were discussing her mother's case.

162
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:06,100
Fine.

163
00:07:06,107 --> 00:07:07,703
Well, I'll be there in 15 minutes.

164
00:07:08,806 --> 00:07:10,200
Yes. Good, Dr. Brennan.

165
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:11,400
We'll chat later.

166
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:18,602
It's a very interesting case.

167
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,603
Brennan identified skeletal remains
as her mother's,

168
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,600
killed by a blow to the head;
Initial suspect was her father,

169
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:27,501
but in the end,we arrested a pig farmer
hit man in witness protection.

170
00:07:27,507 --> 00:07:29,201
- Added wrinkle, Brennan gets called...
- Dr. Hodgins?

171
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:31,301
You're chattering me to
death 'cause you hope

172
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:32,900
I'll forget you called
me a wank-tard.

173
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:35,700
It's a made-up word.

174
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:37,201
No meaning.

175
00:07:37,705 --> 00:07:39,202
My name is Lisa Supak

176
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,403
and I am the assistant U.S. Attorney
attached to this case.

177
00:07:42,408 --> 00:07:46,301
I'd like to hear first from the national
transportation and safety board, Mr. Hobbs.

178
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,203
Thank you. At 8:04 this evening,

179
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,800
a high-speed commuter train
struck a private vehicle.

180
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,800
The front car derailed,
killing three people,

181
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,401
including Senator Paula Davis.

182
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:59,400
Preliminary indications show
that the car was placed there purposely.

183
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:01,803
Dr. Brennan,
was the Jeffersonian able to confirm

184
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:03,602
that the driver of the car
was Warren Lynch?

185
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:06,802
Dental records and physical characteristics
establish that, yes.

186
00:08:06,805 --> 00:08:08,303
The vehicle's registered
to Mr. Lynch.

187
00:08:08,308 --> 00:08:11,201
We'll verify that the jewelry
found on his body was his.

188
00:08:11,205 --> 00:08:13,001
Plus, we have this.

189
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,003
A photograph
from the carpool lane?

190
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:17,400
At 1:56 this afternoon,

191
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:20,403
Mr. Lynch drove illegally
in the Diamond Lane on I-270,

192
00:08:20,406 --> 00:08:24,200
our good old maryland state police cameras,
they caught the infraction.

193
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,700
This is definitely the vehicle
found on the tracks.

194
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:30,103
Nobody saw or heard from
Warren Lynch after this photo was taken.

195
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:33,401
You can't honestly expect
anyone to believe

196
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:36,601
that Warren Lynch committed
suicide by driving into a train.

197
00:08:36,605 --> 00:08:38,701
Daniel Burrows,
securities exchange commission.

198
00:08:38,805 --> 00:08:41,503
We were about to lead charges
against Mr. Lynch

199
00:08:41,508 --> 00:08:43,402
that would not only
wipe him out financially,

200
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:45,401
but send him to prison
for several years.

201
00:08:45,406 --> 00:08:48,502
I heard rumors, but for a man
like Lynch to kill himself...

202
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:50,402
Mr. Lynch did not commit suicide.

203
00:08:50,407 --> 00:08:52,303
Dr. Brennan's examination
shows that he was dead

204
00:08:52,305 --> 00:08:55,301
for at least six hours
before the train struck his car.

205
00:08:55,306 --> 00:08:56,400
Dead how?

206
00:08:56,807 --> 00:08:57,700
I don't know that yet.

207
00:08:57,706 --> 00:09:00,003
But can we assume
that it was foul play?

208
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:03,302
When it becomes public knowledge
that Warren Lynch is dead,

209
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:06,500
stock in Lynchpin International
is going to plummet.

210
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:09,902
Well, it sucks for the people
invested in Lynchpin, but otherwise...

211
00:09:09,905 --> 00:09:11,200
That's motive for murder.

212
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:14,301
How is losing money a motive?

213
00:09:14,307 --> 00:09:15,801
It's called shorting a stock.

214
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:16,601
Uh, basically

215
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:18,603
you bet that
the share price is gonna fall

216
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:20,900
and when it does, you collect.

217
00:09:20,905 --> 00:09:22,102
How much we talking?

218
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:24,302
Tens, maybe hundreds
of millions.

219
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,302
Yes, these
are Warren's things.

220
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:35,902
I bought him the I.D. Bracelet
on our first anniversary.

221
00:09:37,305 --> 00:09:38,900
"Casu consulto."

222
00:09:40,008 --> 00:09:41,100
What does that mean?

223
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:43,000
"Accidentally on purpose."

224
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:44,502
Why do you know things like this?

225
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:46,501
It was kinda my husband's motto.

226
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,000
Mr. Lynch wrote about it
in his autobiography.

227
00:09:49,008 --> 00:09:50,702
He played basketball
in college.

228
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:52,500
Made it all the way
in the national championships.

229
00:09:52,507 --> 00:09:53,901
Warren was the high scorer,

230
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:56,802
but a player on the other team
locked him out of the key.

231
00:09:56,808 --> 00:09:58,401
Warren injured
the opposing player,

232
00:09:58,405 --> 00:09:59,702
sent him to the hospital,

233
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:02,201
and made it look
completely inadvertent.

234
00:10:02,206 --> 00:10:04,000
"Accidentally on purpose."

235
00:10:04,008 --> 00:10:07,000
He wrote this about himself
as if it were a good thing?

236
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:10,300
Well, you don't become Warren Lynch
by playing by the rules.

237
00:10:10,305 --> 00:10:13,502
I'm still his wife so this
all comes to me now, correct?

238
00:10:13,506 --> 00:10:15,902
Still his wife, Mrs. Lynch?

239
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:19,003
Are you and Mr. Lynch
having marital problems?

240
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:21,602
Warren and I were separating.

241
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:22,901
Why?

242
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:24,501
Infidelity.

243
00:10:25,905 --> 00:10:27,000
On who's part?

244
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:29,700
I found out that Warren
was seeing someone only...

245
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,100
the someone turned out to be...

246
00:10:31,105 --> 00:10:32,000
Some dozen.

247
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:34,403
Mm. I'm gonna need a list.

248
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:36,100
When Briana
confronted Warren,

249
00:10:36,107 --> 00:10:38,903
he had a private investigator
look into her activities.

250
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,102
I admit, he didn't come up dry.

251
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:42,802
Private investigator's name?

252
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:43,703
Rick Turko.

253
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:47,000
He was one of Lynch's
all-purpose, go-to, dirty-work fixer.

254
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:48,602
Yeah, I'm familiar with Rick Turko.

255
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:50,702
Thank you for your cooperation.

256
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:55,902
Cheating spouse stands to inherit it all,

257
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:58,401
corrupt business practices
and Turko the private dick.

258
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,402
Where do we start?

259
00:10:59,418 --> 00:11:01,803
Two types of glass
were embedded in what was left of Lynch.

260
00:11:01,806 --> 00:11:02,803
Let's start with glass.

261
00:11:02,805 --> 00:11:05,102
Tempered automotive safety glass
and silicate.

262
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:06,701
Tempered glass came from the car windows.

263
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,802
What about the other?

264
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:10,000
It's 70% Amorphous Silicone Dioxide.

265
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,101
What's that?

266
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:13,300
It's a common domestic container.

267
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:15,401
Oh, like a jar. Mm.

268
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,400
Why can't we just say "a jar"?

269
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,103
Anything new, Zackaroni?

270
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:23,600
Zackaroni?

271
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,503
The victim's left shoulder and elbow
we're badly dislocated postmortem.

272
00:11:27,506 --> 00:11:29,901
You mean between the time he died
and the time he got hit by the train.

273
00:11:29,907 --> 00:11:32,503
Blood flows nonexistent when
the dislocation occurred.

274
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:35,100
Okay, you guys do this stuff
and I'll start on Turko.

275
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:36,101
What's that?

276
00:11:36,105 --> 00:11:37,302
A private investigator.

277
00:11:37,308 --> 00:11:38,500
Turko's an affliction.

278
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:41,400
I'll set up a meeting and call you, okay?

279
00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:44,000
You shouldn't call me Zackaroni.

280
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:46,402
Yeah, I knew that the moment I said it.

281
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,801
I'm going to get a bone
mineral density reading.

282
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:51,801
You didn't actually want the job, did you?

283
00:11:52,106 --> 00:11:54,003
I don't even know what the job is.

284
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,000
Well, Goodman will explain his decision.

285
00:11:57,206 --> 00:11:58,903
Goodman appointed Dr. Saroyan

286
00:11:58,908 --> 00:12:00,001
while I was on vacation

287
00:12:00,007 --> 00:12:02,200
then took a two month
sabbatical to avoid me.

288
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:03,400
That explains a lot.

289
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:07,201
All right, you know, I think it's because
you are very task oriented.

290
00:12:07,206 --> 00:12:11,202
Zack. Task oriented is a euphemism
for lacking overall perspective.

291
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:14,102
Oh, no. No.

292
00:12:15,606 --> 00:12:17,503
Yeah. Yeah, a little.

293
00:12:18,507 --> 00:12:21,000
Like, when's my birthday?

294
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,302
I could get the computer
to remind me about birthdays.

295
00:12:23,306 --> 00:12:25,502
Oh, that's one of a gajillion examples.

296
00:12:25,507 --> 00:12:28,201
You could tell me the other
gajillion minus one.

297
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:29,800
What do you see Zack?

298
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:32,303
Yeah, uh, bone loss.

299
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,502
Lack of bone density
suggests that Warren Lynch

300
00:12:34,506 --> 00:12:36,102
is much older than his 40'S.

301
00:12:36,107 --> 00:12:38,403
But the other indicators of age,

302
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:42,303
epiphysial rings,
cranial sutures, all disagree.

303
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:45,203
Age doesn't explain
the ossification of cartilage

304
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,702
where the ribs meet the sternum.

305
00:12:46,705 --> 00:12:48,100
Well, what does explain it?

306
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:49,703
Opiates.

307
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:58,101
Warren Lynch was a heroin addict.

308
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:02,002
Agent Booth,
I'm a private investigator.

309
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:05,503
My greatest asset is my discretion.

310
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:07,001
Briana Lynch already told us

311
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:08,903
that you worked for
her husband, Mr. Turko.

312
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:11,503
Well, Mrs. Lynch is welcomed
to say whatever she likes.

313
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:15,500
That client confidentiality routine
no longer exists when the client is dead.

314
00:13:15,706 --> 00:13:18,201
That's not the assurance
i give my very demanding,

315
00:13:18,206 --> 00:13:19,900
very high profile clients.

316
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:21,702
'Til death do us not part.

317
00:13:21,707 --> 00:13:23,101
Yeah, how would your very demanding,

318
00:13:23,108 --> 00:13:24,603
very high profile clients feel

319
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:29,100
if they found out that, uh,
you procured heroin for Warren Lynch.

320
00:13:30,806 --> 00:13:31,802
What?

321
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:33,100
Warren Lynch was a heroin addict.

322
00:13:33,107 --> 00:13:34,600
I'm gonna open up a drug investigation

323
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:36,200
on you, Mr. Turko; Once

324
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:37,402
the press gets wind of that

325
00:13:37,405 --> 00:13:39,103
your very high profile clients

326
00:13:39,106 --> 00:13:42,203
will find some other
unprincipled Mr. Fix-it.

327
00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:43,400
Warren Lynch was a junkie?

328
00:13:44,905 --> 00:13:46,002
What's your evidence?

329
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,303
Bones.

330
00:13:53,807 --> 00:13:55,101
So what does all this mean?

331
00:13:55,207 --> 00:13:56,503
Sum it up for the man, Bones.

332
00:13:56,506 --> 00:13:57,801
Warren Lynch suffered declining

333
00:13:57,808 --> 00:14:00,201
bone mass due to long term abuse

334
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:03,003
of his hypothalamic
pituitary gonadal access.

335
00:14:03,107 --> 00:14:06,403
Nothing says junkie like your
gonads access, Ricky.

336
00:14:06,607 --> 00:14:07,900
I had no idea.

337
00:14:08,405 --> 00:14:11,003
And I certainly never procured
any heroin for him.

338
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:12,700
Warren Lynch sure as hell wasn't trolling

339
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,200
for ten dollar hits in Lincoln Heights.

340
00:14:14,307 --> 00:14:16,703
Come on, Agent Booth,
you know my rep.

341
00:14:16,907 --> 00:14:18,202
I'm a sin eater.

342
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,800
I make problems go away.

343
00:14:19,806 --> 00:14:23,401
You mean like when Lynch's wife found out
that he was sleeping with other women.

344
00:14:26,505 --> 00:14:29,001
All right, anything I say
strictest confidence, correct?

345
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:34,700
Warren Lynch brought me in
to deal with a blackmailer.

346
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:38,200
Warren Lynch was being blackmailed?

347
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:39,801
By one of his girlfriends?

348
00:14:39,808 --> 00:14:41,301
That would be my assumption, yes.

349
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:42,703
I paid them off before,

350
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,402
but this was a much
bigger deal, more serious.

351
00:14:45,607 --> 00:14:46,902
Had to be the heroin, right?

352
00:14:47,306 --> 00:14:48,102
How'd it play out?

353
00:14:48,106 --> 00:14:50,501
Well, I negotiated
the payment down from a mil

354
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:52,403
to a quarter million, paid them off.

355
00:14:52,407 --> 00:14:53,403
That was three days ago.

356
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:56,202
- How?
- Dead drop at Rock Creek Park.

357
00:14:57,406 --> 00:14:59,402
And you have no idea who it was.

358
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:00,700
Well, I had a phone call,

359
00:15:00,707 --> 00:15:01,503
I traced it back,

360
00:15:01,506 --> 00:15:03,500
it dead-ended on a stolen cell phone.

361
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,303
You did a good job.

362
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:15,800
Given your heroin bombshell,

363
00:15:15,805 --> 00:15:16,702
I went back to what tissue

364
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:19,100
remained and found traces
of laudanine and raticuline.

365
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:21,000
Alkaloids found in the opium poppy.

366
00:15:21,108 --> 00:15:23,603
I'd like Angela to do
a facial reconstruction.

367
00:15:24,308 --> 00:15:25,400
Confirm my finding?

368
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:28,500
It's handy having
a pathologist right in the building.

369
00:15:28,707 --> 00:15:32,100
To turn opium into heroin
it's exposed to hot acidic and hydride,

370
00:15:32,107 --> 00:15:34,303
which produces 18 neutral impurities.

371
00:15:34,408 --> 00:15:35,803
The ratio of these
impurities indicates

372
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:37,700
the heroin's origin,
in this case Mexico.

373
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:40,101
Mexican heroin is very common.

374
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,403
I wonder if there's anything we can do
to narrow it down further.

375
00:15:47,008 --> 00:15:48,500
Gas chromatography...

376
00:15:49,206 --> 00:15:51,202
shows there was also
fetanyl in the heroin.

377
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:53,301
What's that?

378
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:56,501
This reminds me of when you interviewed me
to be your grad student.

379
00:15:57,306 --> 00:15:58,502
She knows what fetanyl is.

380
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:02,303
It's a narcotic which boosts
the effects of the heroin.

381
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:05,100
According to Metro cops,

382
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:08,403
14 addicts od'd this week
off this one shipment.

383
00:16:08,806 --> 00:16:09,802
Have you told Booth?

384
00:16:09,808 --> 00:16:11,000
I'll leave that to you.

385
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:15,502
How'd I do?

386
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,501
I thought she did quite well.

387
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:22,802
You said you had something else to show me.

388
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:27,400
In a car fire gasoline vapor ignites
at 280 degrees celsius

389
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:30,102
and rises to a plain
temperature of 2200 degrees.

390
00:16:30,305 --> 00:16:32,200
If the gas tank were
full at the time of impact,

391
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,200
the fire should of burned

392
00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:35,400
for approximately 20 minutes
without intervention.

393
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:36,800
Tell me that's not a real skeleton.

394
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:40,500
No, we made him out
of calcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite.

395
00:16:40,506 --> 00:16:41,601
And spam.

396
00:16:41,905 --> 00:16:43,603
20 minutes now.

397
00:16:47,308 --> 00:16:49,401
It's still a significant amount of spam.

398
00:16:49,606 --> 00:16:51,402
And according to the fire
department report,

399
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:52,801
the car burned for 40 minutes

400
00:16:52,808 --> 00:16:54,603
and it still took four minutes to put out.

401
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,902
Which means there was extra fuel.

402
00:16:56,907 --> 00:16:58,200
And the extra glass you found?

403
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,402
- Five gallon mason jars.
- Six of them.

404
00:17:00,508 --> 00:17:01,600
Filled with gasoline.

405
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:03,301
Yeah, or moonshine.

406
00:17:04,706 --> 00:17:06,002
Why does the whole lab

407
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:07,300
smell like a luau?

408
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:08,800
Zack and Hodgins are proving

409
00:17:08,805 --> 00:17:11,101
that there was extra
accelerant in Lynch's vehicle.

410
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,702
Using what medium?

411
00:17:12,808 --> 00:17:14,703
Artificial bone covered with spam.

412
00:17:16,006 --> 00:17:17,300
Turn this off.

413
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:29,600
Why wasn't I told about this?

414
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:32,600
I encourage independent inquiry.

415
00:17:32,607 --> 00:17:35,002
Your encouragement does not
signify my authorization.

416
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,200
If it happens again I will take action,

417
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:38,000
and I'm from New York,

418
00:17:38,005 --> 00:17:40,400
which means that I will take New York
action, am I clear?

419
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,700
Not at all.

420
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:43,403
I'm from Michigan.

421
00:17:43,408 --> 00:17:45,803
Dr. Saroyan means she'll make us
watch musical theatre.

422
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:46,602
Wrong New York.

423
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:49,001
I'm more from the get mugged in broad
daylight tradition.

424
00:17:49,108 --> 00:17:50,902
This is not a high school science fair.

425
00:17:50,905 --> 00:17:52,401
This is the Jeffersonian institute.

426
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,501
Unauthorized experiments in
forensics will get you fired.

427
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:59,000
But we're Hodgepodge and Zackaroni.

428
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:00,202
And they work for me.

429
00:18:00,206 --> 00:18:01,903
You know, what I'd really like to do here

430
00:18:01,905 --> 00:18:03,200
is enjoy a meeting of the minds.

431
00:18:03,505 --> 00:18:05,901
But if you insist on an
organizational pyramid,

432
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:07,602
I will be at the top.

433
00:18:14,806 --> 00:18:15,802
Spam.

434
00:18:15,805 --> 00:18:18,802
Yup. There are mason jars
filled with gasoline in the backseat

435
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:20,600
intended to break when the train hit.

436
00:18:20,606 --> 00:18:22,001
Mm, and they got this with spam?

437
00:18:22,008 --> 00:18:22,800
Yeah, spam.

438
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:25,502
And Cam, she got all bent out of shape.

439
00:18:25,508 --> 00:18:27,003
She wants to authorize all experiments.

440
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:28,000
Great. You know,

441
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:31,703
Zack and Hodgins, they do an experiment
with fake bones and spam.

442
00:18:31,707 --> 00:18:33,400
Yeah, what is your spam fixation?

443
00:18:33,408 --> 00:18:36,700
Uh, defense lawyer hears
spam, he makes a joke,

444
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,401
the jury laughs and everything

445
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:41,301
we get from the Jeffersonian
is framed as, uh,

446
00:18:41,306 --> 00:18:42,500
goofy science, you know,

447
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:46,101
from a bunch of squints with no
connection to the real world.

448
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:47,103
That wouldn't happen.

449
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:49,800
Really? And the time you dropped
the dead monkey down the elevator shaft?

450
00:18:49,805 --> 00:18:51,000
No, that was to show...

451
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:54,803
Okay, I take your point.

452
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:57,401
Look, Cam's goal is a successful

453
00:18:57,408 --> 00:18:59,103
prosecution in a court of law.

454
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:00,400
Same as mine and yours.

455
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,301
No, you're all about finding the truth.

456
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:06,301
Okay, your words say good,
but your tone says bad.

457
00:19:06,805 --> 00:19:08,401
So it's confusing.

458
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:12,000
Cam knows that too much truth
is just as bad as too little.

459
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:15,600
Which is why she got the job.

460
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:17,200
Booth.

461
00:19:17,508 --> 00:19:20,303
You know, Angela says that you and Cam
had a sexual relationship.

462
00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:21,800
Does that effect your view of her?

463
00:19:21,806 --> 00:19:22,603
Patch me through.

464
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:24,703
Wildly out of line,
just so you know that.

465
00:19:26,805 --> 00:19:27,603
When?

466
00:19:28,906 --> 00:19:29,803
Did you get the doer?

467
00:19:29,806 --> 00:19:32,203
Personal prerogative
is at the heart of scientific inquiry.

468
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:33,100
Bones.

469
00:19:35,805 --> 00:19:37,203
Thanks for the notification.

470
00:19:47,308 --> 00:19:48,603
What?

471
00:19:51,026 --> 00:19:55,501
The man who was charged with
murdering your mother...

472
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,480
The pig farmer, Vince McVicar.

473
00:19:58,486 --> 00:20:00,160
He was killed.

474
00:20:01,475 --> 00:20:05,432
Today at Alexandria Federal Facility.

475
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:10,062
I don't...

476
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:14,801
he was the only connection to my father.

477
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:17,740
His trial was gonna be my...

478
00:20:23,346 --> 00:20:26,763
How am I ever gonna find out
what really happened?

479
00:20:37,158 --> 00:20:38,641
That's not Warren Lynch.

480
00:20:38,648 --> 00:20:40,042
How accurate is this thing?

481
00:20:40,045 --> 00:20:42,322
It's not the machine that's
accurate, it's Angela.

482
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:43,472
And she's good.

483
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,241
That is not Warren Lynch.

484
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:47,251
Hey, Zack provided a skull

485
00:20:47,258 --> 00:20:49,202
and this is the face that goes with it.

486
00:20:50,068 --> 00:20:51,881
You know, could it be the wrong skull?

487
00:20:51,986 --> 00:20:54,040
Zack doesn't make that kind of mistake.

488
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:55,811
He's also very good.

489
00:20:55,818 --> 00:20:57,290
What about the dental records?

490
00:20:57,295 --> 00:20:58,791
I'll check them for a tampering.

491
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:00,460
But you're certain
that the body in the car...

492
00:21:00,465 --> 00:21:02,381
Is not Warren Lynch.

493
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,890
Absolutely certain.

494
00:21:11,626 --> 00:21:15,641
Warren Lynch, no.
No this was the man behind the wheel.

495
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:17,262
You had dental records.

496
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:19,651
Well, somebody digitized
Lynch's dental x-rays

497
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:21,160
and then re-filmed them,

498
00:21:21,165 --> 00:21:23,552
utilizing authentic
alpha-numeric bar codes.

499
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:25,562
Their records were expertly faked.

500
00:21:25,568 --> 00:21:27,182
Then where the hell is Warren Lynch?

501
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,372
I've informed the FBI

502
00:21:28,378 --> 00:21:30,280
that they might want to start looking
for him, in the meantime,

503
00:21:30,286 --> 00:21:31,690
we're moving to I.D. This guy.

504
00:21:31,968 --> 00:21:33,460
Mistakes like this cannot happen

505
00:21:33,467 --> 00:21:35,363
when the case concerns a dead senator.

506
00:21:35,368 --> 00:21:36,983
Ms. Montenegro uncovered a fraud;

507
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:38,450
that's the opposite of a mistake.

508
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,732
Save it for
the press conference, Dr. Saroyan.

509
00:21:43,476 --> 00:21:44,480
Thank you.

510
00:21:44,587 --> 00:21:47,570
Hey, if you'd made a mistake,
I'd have thrown you to the wolves.

511
00:21:48,827 --> 00:21:52,492
The Metro cops hated the guy
pushing the Mexican heroin,

512
00:21:52,538 --> 00:21:55,471
laced with fentanyl is Eddie Bean:

513
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:57,972
Young guy, baldy-headed, five-five,

514
00:21:58,017 --> 00:21:59,383
145 pounds.

515
00:22:01,068 --> 00:22:02,531
You know, if drugs we're legalized,

516
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:04,980
they could be dispensed
from a clean, safe,

517
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:06,770
controlled outlets, by trained personnel;

518
00:22:06,776 --> 00:22:08,740
not in alleyways by criminals.

519
00:22:08,815 --> 00:22:10,633
Yeah... right.

520
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:15,343
- Hey, that's our guy; let's go!
- Hold on! Whoa! Shh!

521
00:22:15,397 --> 00:22:19,553
What we're gonna do
is we gotta wait... until he deals.

522
00:22:19,748 --> 00:22:21,361
Catch him in the act.

523
00:22:22,146 --> 00:22:24,201
We wait, for how long?

524
00:22:24,585 --> 00:22:26,362
However long it takes.

525
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,532
Well, what do we do while we wait?

526
00:22:29,485 --> 00:22:31,472
This is a stakeout;
we converse.

527
00:22:31,735 --> 00:22:34,471
Well, I tried to initiate
conversation on the drug war, but...

528
00:22:34,476 --> 00:22:36,383
Oh, god. Fine. You know what?
Let's just...

529
00:22:36,386 --> 00:22:38,601
talk about something
we're not going to argue about.

530
00:22:42,268 --> 00:22:43,841
You been out to your mother's grave?

531
00:22:44,857 --> 00:22:47,372
- Not since the funeral.
- Really?

532
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:48,663
Why would I?

533
00:22:49,045 --> 00:22:50,490
Well, to connect.

534
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:51,880
She's dead.

535
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:56,411
Fine. You know what?
Forget it.

536
00:22:56,445 --> 00:22:58,641
"Dead," as in gone from this world.

537
00:23:04,337 --> 00:23:05,532
Excuse me.

538
00:23:06,777 --> 00:23:08,222
I'm curious.

539
00:23:08,766 --> 00:23:10,973
Um, do you talk to the headstone?

540
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:12,343
I mean, what do you,
what do you say?

541
00:23:13,565 --> 00:23:15,740
It looks like I'm talking
to the headstone,

542
00:23:15,886 --> 00:23:17,711
but what I'm really saying is...

543
00:23:18,586 --> 00:23:20,733
forget about where the words are aimed.

544
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,240
What I say is that...

545
00:23:23,297 --> 00:23:24,242
I remember them.

546
00:23:25,995 --> 00:23:30,122
They can't hear you...
because they're dead.

547
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:33,561
My mouth moves, words come out,

548
00:23:33,577 --> 00:23:37,170
but none seem to get across
the drawbridge to the Princess,

549
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:38,910
I know who waits within.

550
00:23:40,908 --> 00:23:41,783
We're on!

551
00:23:43,886 --> 00:23:44,741
What Princess?!

552
00:23:45,456 --> 00:23:46,440
Hey! Ho!
Hey, Eddie.

553
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:49,100
- Eddie, how you doing to day?
- What?

554
00:23:50,215 --> 00:23:51,103
Pockets; watch out for needles.

555
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,240
Don't you have to read him his rights
before you strangle him?

556
00:23:54,896 --> 00:23:55,632
Empty.

557
00:23:55,676 --> 00:23:56,553
Okay, you know,

558
00:23:56,677 --> 00:23:58,023
I had to hold his throat closed
so he wouldn't swallow the evidence.

559
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:00,353
If you bite me,

560
00:24:00,828 --> 00:24:03,172
I will squeeze your little pin head off.

561
00:24:04,505 --> 00:24:05,531
Okay.

562
00:24:06,386 --> 00:24:07,151
Okay, oh, easy.

563
00:24:08,256 --> 00:24:09,280
there it is.

564
00:24:09,835 --> 00:24:11,793
You shouldn't swallow heroin;
It's dangerous.

565
00:24:13,145 --> 00:24:14,783
Great. Come on, Eddie.

566
00:24:16,216 --> 00:24:17,231
Eddie...
Eddie! Eddie, Eddie,

567
00:24:17,496 --> 00:24:18,373
Eddie, Eddie. Hey, Eddie.

568
00:24:18,996 --> 00:24:20,383
I'm gonna ask you a question.

569
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:22,512
Okay?
You answer; You'll walk away.

570
00:24:22,646 --> 00:24:23,460
All right?

571
00:24:23,548 --> 00:24:24,350
If you don't answer...

572
00:24:24,646 --> 00:24:26,650
You book me; I get sick.

573
00:24:27,657 --> 00:24:28,511
I know the drill.

574
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:30,321
If you don't answer...

575
00:24:31,245 --> 00:24:32,083
I'm gonna cram this

576
00:24:32,318 --> 00:24:33,111
back down your throat

577
00:24:33,498 --> 00:24:34,771
without the protection.

578
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,950
All right. You sold some of this
crap to a tall guy,

579
00:24:38,158 --> 00:24:39,281
over six-and-half feet tall.

580
00:24:39,756 --> 00:24:41,323
- Show him, Bones.
- What?

581
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:42,413
Show him.

582
00:24:45,865 --> 00:24:47,680
I think that tall?

583
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:49,132
Uh... nobody I know.

584
00:24:50,147 --> 00:24:51,271
Here. Come on, eat it.

585
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:52,271
Eat it. Eat, that's it.

586
00:24:52,496 --> 00:24:53,422
Get it in there.

587
00:24:53,545 --> 00:24:54,772
That's it.

588
00:24:56,776 --> 00:24:58,083
- Ray!
- Ray?

589
00:24:58,146 --> 00:24:59,383
Ray. Ray Story.

590
00:24:59,427 --> 00:25:00,272
Tell me about Ray. Huh?

591
00:25:00,315 --> 00:25:02,591
Everybody knows him down here,
man; he's a longtime skel.

592
00:25:03,005 --> 00:25:04,790
When was the last time you saw him?

593
00:25:04,876 --> 00:25:06,642
He bought a stick of dynamite
about three days ago.

594
00:25:08,147 --> 00:25:09,401
I feel I should alert you:

595
00:25:09,456 --> 00:25:12,723
There's an additive in this
heroin that causes overdoses.

596
00:25:14,108 --> 00:25:15,371
- Well...
- Thanks.

597
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,603
Hey, where'd you find her?

598
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:18,872
Museum.

599
00:25:20,636 --> 00:25:21,891
We should warn the addicts.

600
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:23,610
Yeah, like they do on a pack of cigarettes.

601
00:25:23,945 --> 00:25:25,491
When? Thanks.

602
00:25:26,577 --> 00:25:28,213
- What?
- They found Warren Lynch.

603
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:30,792
Mr. Lynch was thrown from a speeding car.

604
00:25:32,506 --> 00:25:33,950
It's a minor miracle he survived.

605
00:25:35,837 --> 00:25:38,051
It may be because he was
already unconscious at the time.

606
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:39,430
Unconscious?

607
00:25:39,695 --> 00:25:40,470
Yes.

608
00:25:40,537 --> 00:25:41,422
Badly beaten.

609
00:25:41,588 --> 00:25:44,632
Internal bleeding,
broken ribs, both legs.

610
00:25:45,376 --> 00:25:46,660
Some spinal damage.

611
00:25:47,198 --> 00:25:47,941
Broken pelvis.

612
00:25:48,837 --> 00:25:49,821
When can we talk to him?

613
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:51,283
Any time you want.

614
00:25:51,287 --> 00:25:52,970
As long as you don't expect a response.

615
00:25:53,525 --> 00:25:55,352
This man has severe brain damage.

616
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:57,082
Off the record:

617
00:25:57,215 --> 00:25:58,171
He's not going to wake up.

618
00:25:59,116 --> 00:26:00,052
Best case scenario:

619
00:26:00,245 --> 00:26:02,732
He spends the rest of his life
hooked up to feeding tubes.

620
00:26:02,945 --> 00:26:05,063
This is one of
the richest men in the country.

621
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:07,313
Most of the time that might mean something.

622
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:08,653
Not now.

623
00:26:08,657 --> 00:26:09,573
Dr. Lawrence,

624
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:13,553
this man holds the key to how and why
senator Paula Davis died.

625
00:26:13,585 --> 00:26:14,550
I'm sorry.

626
00:26:14,728 --> 00:26:16,571
Anything that man has in his head...

627
00:26:16,757 --> 00:26:18,032
it's going to stay there.

628
00:26:18,088 --> 00:26:19,480
Excuse me.

629
00:26:28,348 --> 00:26:29,942
ed me a hundred times.

630
00:26:29,996 --> 00:26:31,342
It's important for us to explain

631
00:26:31,347 --> 00:26:33,323
how the victim's shoulder
and elbow we're dislocated.

632
00:26:33,568 --> 00:26:35,902
I recreated the most likely sequence.

633
00:26:40,168 --> 00:26:41,573
The victim was dead when this happened.

634
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,223
He didn't feel it.

635
00:26:43,415 --> 00:26:44,760
Run it again.

636
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:49,533
Almost like he was putting his jacket on.

637
00:26:49,657 --> 00:26:51,480
Corpses don't usually do that.

638
00:26:51,788 --> 00:26:54,053
These injuries occurred
when the corpse was forced into a jacket.

639
00:26:54,318 --> 00:26:56,343
Yeah, most likely by two people.

640
00:26:56,745 --> 00:26:57,931
Yeah, in a big hurry.

641
00:26:58,018 --> 00:26:59,683
They had a train to meet.

642
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:02,000
You got anything on
the H.O.V. Lane photograph?

643
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:06,200
Yeah. It was relatively easy to get the
license plate numbers from these two cars.

644
00:27:06,938 --> 00:27:07,682
Yeah, well...

645
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:08,603
I'll check 'em out.

646
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,460
Uh, there was another car.

647
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:11,513
In the next lane.

648
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,343
How do you know that?

649
00:27:13,355 --> 00:27:15,441
Well, rich guys keep their cars shiny.

650
00:27:16,576 --> 00:27:19,180
Adjusting for the diffraction
of light caused by the curve...

651
00:27:19,225 --> 00:27:20,242
It's a navigator.

652
00:27:21,055 --> 00:27:22,513
But get this.

653
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:27,090
I don't know if that's of any use to you.

654
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:30,222
Yeah. That's of use.

655
00:27:31,698 --> 00:27:32,540
Booth...

656
00:27:32,616 --> 00:27:34,430
do either of these count as experiments?

657
00:27:34,748 --> 00:27:37,013
'Cause if they do,
we could both get fired...

658
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:38,551
by your old sweetheart.

659
00:27:39,347 --> 00:27:41,363
You know, you just quit telling, Bones, who

660
00:27:42,016 --> 00:27:43,320
you think I've slept with.

661
00:27:43,475 --> 00:27:44,281
"Think"?

662
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:45,441
What do you mean "think"?

663
00:27:49,427 --> 00:27:50,933
Two people forced a corpse into a jacket;

664
00:27:50,957 --> 00:27:52,863
that's... excellent work.

665
00:27:52,906 --> 00:27:53,840
Who's that?

666
00:27:54,028 --> 00:27:55,251
I think it's Rick Turko.

667
00:27:55,277 --> 00:27:58,473
It means Turko's probably the last person
to see Lynch before he fell off the radar.

668
00:27:58,567 --> 00:28:02,021
Of course, Angela and Zack are scared
that this counts as an experiment,

669
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:03,920
and you are going to fire them.

670
00:28:04,105 --> 00:28:05,971
Ah! I am getting through.

671
00:28:06,035 --> 00:28:07,833
Why did you take this job, Camille?

672
00:28:07,907 --> 00:28:09,050
Why shouldn't I, Seeley?

673
00:28:09,107 --> 00:28:10,870
Because it's basically herding cats

674
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:12,682
and you're a dog person.

675
00:28:12,705 --> 00:28:13,931
Dogs herd cats.

676
00:28:13,997 --> 00:28:15,550
Dogs don't do that.

677
00:28:15,676 --> 00:28:17,091
Eh, chase 'em up trees, whatever.

678
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:19,710
Seriously, Cam,
why did you take this job?

679
00:28:20,748 --> 00:28:24,120
These... are titanium
rib clippers from Germany.

680
00:28:24,158 --> 00:28:25,230
My last job?

681
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:26,582
Used bolt cutters from home depot.

682
00:28:26,655 --> 00:28:28,151
These are much, much nicer.

683
00:28:28,236 --> 00:28:29,280
This autopsy table,

684
00:28:29,326 --> 00:28:32,380
has down-draft ventilation
no rotting-corpse smell, Seeley.

685
00:28:32,388 --> 00:28:33,771
My last table didn't even have a drain.

686
00:28:33,877 --> 00:28:36,323
Think about that a second:
Leaky corpse; no drain.

687
00:28:36,538 --> 00:28:40,522
So you took this job for better equipment?

688
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:44,200
I've spent my whole professional life
in basement rooms with no windows.

689
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,342
Now I'm in the Jeffersonian Institute.

690
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,060
What?

691
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:50,202
Gotta ask.

692
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:51,562
You so do not.

693
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:53,160
Did you take this job because of...?

694
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:55,683
Oh, my god, the ego!

695
00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:57,350
Go ahead, say it.

696
00:29:01,396 --> 00:29:03,360
Nothing to do with you.

697
00:29:04,265 --> 00:29:05,861
I need Bones this afternoon.

698
00:29:05,898 --> 00:29:06,960
Okay.

699
00:29:07,016 --> 00:29:10,123
It's about her mother's murder
and her father's disappearance.

700
00:29:10,196 --> 00:29:11,532
Plus, she dedicated her book to you...

701
00:29:11,586 --> 00:29:13,623
It's a legitimate case, Cam.

702
00:29:13,815 --> 00:29:14,771
I know; I read the file.

703
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:18,233
Why hasn't she confronted me?

704
00:29:18,655 --> 00:29:19,492
About what?

705
00:29:19,528 --> 00:29:22,303
About me being parachuted in over her head.

706
00:29:23,046 --> 00:29:24,960
Finds me intimidating, right?

707
00:29:26,326 --> 00:29:28,382
Hey, I intimidate people.

708
00:29:28,537 --> 00:29:29,882
Yeah.

709
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:33,421
Bones doesn't intimidate.

710
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:35,733
Then what?

711
00:29:35,747 --> 00:29:38,351
Oh, you've seen the way
she stares at human remains

712
00:29:38,388 --> 00:29:39,852
before she makes a decision.

713
00:29:39,898 --> 00:29:40,951
Yes?

714
00:29:41,016 --> 00:29:45,141
You're human remains and...
she hasn't made a decision yet.

715
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:53,630
How do I help her make the right decision?

716
00:29:54,108 --> 00:29:55,773
Go for the truth. Yeah.

717
00:29:55,856 --> 00:29:57,781
Take care of her people.

718
00:29:58,188 --> 00:29:59,001
Oh, and, uh,

719
00:29:59,075 --> 00:30:00,803
I like the whole intimidation thing.

720
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,092
I think it's cute.

721
00:30:15,095 --> 00:30:17,213
I got no reason to lie.

722
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:19,150
I'm facing life, at least

723
00:30:19,155 --> 00:30:20,762
probably going
to get executed.

724
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:21,882
What did you do?

725
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:24,332
Mr. Downs killed
his entire family.

726
00:30:24,336 --> 00:30:25,611
I killed your friend

727
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,723
'cause he cut in the cafeteria line

728
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:30,012
and snagged the last orange juice.

729
00:30:30,016 --> 00:30:33,302
Broke of a sharpened toothbrush
in his jugular.

730
00:30:33,305 --> 00:30:34,920
Mr. Downs, the man you killed...

731
00:30:34,925 --> 00:30:37,203
- McVicar.
- ... he's not my friend.

732
00:30:37,206 --> 00:30:38,883
He killed my mother.

733
00:30:38,888 --> 00:30:41,033
You come to tell me "thanks"?

734
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:45,120
No. McVicar was my last chance
to find out some things.

735
00:30:45,328 --> 00:30:48,461
McVicar might have known
something about my father.

736
00:30:48,465 --> 00:30:49,881
I can't ask my father because

737
00:30:49,986 --> 00:30:54,183
he left a message on my answering machine,
telling me to stop looking for him.

738
00:30:57,318 --> 00:30:59,391
I'll tell you what...

739
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:01,793
maybe...

740
00:31:03,006 --> 00:31:07,412
look at McVicar's murder
as a second message from Max,

741
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:10,392
one that he didn't use the phone for.

742
00:31:11,696 --> 00:31:14,791
I never mentioned
my father's name was Max.

743
00:31:16,306 --> 00:31:17,672
I'm done.

744
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:19,782
Did you perform a hit for Max Keenan?

745
00:31:22,036 --> 00:31:24,102
You performed a hit for Max Keenan?

746
00:31:24,105 --> 00:31:26,570
Take it as a sign from God.

747
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:36,900
How am I going to tell Russ our father
order the death of another human being?

748
00:31:36,906 --> 00:31:39,411
If he did that-- and I'm not
saying it happened that way--

749
00:31:39,418 --> 00:31:42,220
then your father took down
the man who murdered his wife.

750
00:31:42,226 --> 00:31:44,702
Good people don't have other
people murdered.

751
00:31:44,706 --> 00:31:46,571
Good people don't even know how.

752
00:31:46,675 --> 00:31:48,251
Your father buried your mother in a

753
00:31:48,255 --> 00:31:50,471
pair of new shoes in the cemetery,

754
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,261
with her dolphin belt buckle
that reminded her of you

755
00:31:53,268 --> 00:31:54,950
because you both love dolphins.

756
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:56,610
This is not making him a good man.

757
00:31:56,618 --> 00:31:58,533
People can be more than one thing.

758
00:31:59,497 --> 00:32:01,440
We were at a dead end, Okay?
Now we're not.

759
00:32:01,447 --> 00:32:04,210
Okay. We know that your
father got to Mitchell Downs,

760
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:05,800
persuaded him to kill McVicar.

761
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:07,672
We find out how he did that,

762
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:11,223
we're that much closer to finding out
what happened to your old man.

763
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:14,210
I mean that's...
if you still want to find him.

764
00:32:14,215 --> 00:32:15,691
I do.

765
00:32:15,695 --> 00:32:18,630
Okay. Silver lining.

766
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:16,403
Warren Lynch was in on it.

767
00:33:17,477 --> 00:33:18,850
Where'd that come from?

768
00:33:18,855 --> 00:33:21,562
He had his own dolphin;
that NC lots of "a's"

769
00:33:21,565 --> 00:33:23,182
National Championship ring?

770
00:33:23,188 --> 00:33:24,242
His own dolphin.

771
00:33:24,245 --> 00:33:27,441
All the rest of his jewelry was removed
and placed on the dead man:

772
00:33:27,445 --> 00:33:28,992
His $10,000 watch,

773
00:33:28,995 --> 00:33:30,213
his I.D. Band from his wife,

774
00:33:30,215 --> 00:33:31,701
his two other rings,

775
00:33:31,706 --> 00:33:33,893
but not the championship ring.

776
00:33:33,895 --> 00:33:34,741
That's good, Bones.

777
00:33:34,745 --> 00:33:36,830
The only reason they wouldn't rip
it off his hands is...

778
00:33:37,335 --> 00:33:39,723
...because Lynch was calling the shots.

779
00:33:40,048 --> 00:33:42,953
And I know exactly who was in on it.

780
00:33:45,366 --> 00:33:49,260
So, Warren Lynch and I
conspired to disappear him for a few days

781
00:33:49,267 --> 00:33:52,621
so that we could profit from shorting
Lynchpin stock?

782
00:33:53,027 --> 00:33:54,662
Well, you know, that's my thinking.

783
00:33:56,306 --> 00:33:58,541
then dressed a junkie in Warren's clothes,

784
00:33:59,146 --> 00:34:02,350
planted him in front of a train and... wait.

785
00:34:02,456 --> 00:34:04,101
Did I murder the junkie?

786
00:34:04,105 --> 00:34:05,942
No, Bones said you probably found him dead.

787
00:34:05,946 --> 00:34:07,413
But what I think is that

788
00:34:07,415 --> 00:34:11,543
you and Lynch intended a white-collar crime,

789
00:34:11,547 --> 00:34:13,392
but a senator died.

790
00:34:14,256 --> 00:34:17,492
Then I got all hinky and I tossed Warren out
of the car at 80 miles an hour?

791
00:34:20,076 --> 00:34:21,460
Is, is that a confession?

792
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:23,801
Nah, nah.

793
00:34:24,406 --> 00:34:26,012
Just getting it straight.

794
00:34:26,156 --> 00:34:29,770
You know,
as a professional investigator myself,

795
00:34:30,377 --> 00:34:32,603
I have to point out that blackmailers

796
00:34:32,807 --> 00:34:34,512
make much better suspects.

797
00:34:35,176 --> 00:34:36,712
Lynchpin has no record of

798
00:34:36,717 --> 00:34:38,811
quarter-million-dollar payout
three days ago.

799
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:43,133
Well, there's not exactly a column for
blackmail payouts in the corporate books.

800
00:34:43,376 --> 00:34:46,223
If I only agreed to the full payout,

801
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,692
Lynch might have never been taken
by those animals.

802
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:53,223
Hey, let's play a little show and tell, huh?

803
00:34:54,087 --> 00:34:56,571
'Cause we can put you with
Lynch moments

804
00:34:56,577 --> 00:34:58,542
before he fell off the radar.

805
00:35:03,278 --> 00:35:06,840
That's maybe me
before he fell off the radar.

806
00:35:06,947 --> 00:35:08,672
We worked together.

807
00:35:11,558 --> 00:35:13,322
You got nothing.

808
00:35:16,777 --> 00:35:17,581
Booth.

809
00:35:24,275 --> 00:35:25,272
Do that lying thing.

810
00:35:25,276 --> 00:35:26,441
Could you be more specific?

811
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:29,562
Tell him Lynch woke up
and gave a statement incriminating him.

812
00:35:29,566 --> 00:35:30,832
Turko knows the lying thing.

813
00:35:31,135 --> 00:35:33,471
Tell him Lynch said something
only Lynch could say.

814
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:35,940
Ooh, great idea, except for the
"only Lynch could say it" part.

815
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:37,673
The ring?

816
00:35:37,676 --> 00:35:39,513
Ah, he'll ask for specifics of
the conversations.

817
00:35:39,515 --> 00:35:40,862
I got to cut him loose.

818
00:35:40,865 --> 00:35:41,913
He's going to get away with it?

819
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:44,090
Well, you know, that
happens sometimes, Bones.

820
00:35:44,096 --> 00:35:46,250
It's that brown little
smelly part of the job.

821
00:35:46,356 --> 00:35:48,120
Shoulder and elbow.

822
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:49,921
The junkie's shoulder and elbow were

823
00:35:49,927 --> 00:35:52,122
dislocated when they
forced him into Lynch's jacket.

824
00:35:53,158 --> 00:35:54,563
We don't know if Lynch
was there for that.

825
00:35:54,565 --> 00:35:56,681
It took two people.
It was him.

826
00:35:58,196 --> 00:36:02,761
Come on, Booth, the part of you with the
big gambling problem must love this idea.

827
00:36:05,117 --> 00:36:06,442
Right there.

828
00:36:06,547 --> 00:36:09,353
That's the reason
you didn't get Cam's job.

829
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,431
Oh, two against one.

830
00:36:14,538 --> 00:36:15,720
That's unfair.

831
00:36:15,726 --> 00:36:17,011
Warren Lynch woke up.

832
00:36:17,015 --> 00:36:19,853
Ah, and he's talking, right?

833
00:36:19,956 --> 00:36:22,253
Huh? Is he pointing his finger
straight at me?

834
00:36:22,357 --> 00:36:23,110
That's correct.

835
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:23,943
What's he saying?

836
00:36:23,947 --> 00:36:26,532
He let you take all of his jewelry
except his Championship ring.

837
00:36:26,538 --> 00:36:29,350
No, I asked, what did he say in words?

838
00:36:33,385 --> 00:36:35,233
Hey, unless I'm under arrest,

839
00:36:35,335 --> 00:36:36,682
I'm leaving, folks.

840
00:36:36,686 --> 00:36:40,643
Mr. Lynch said it was difficult
getting his jacket onto the corpse.

841
00:36:41,526 --> 00:36:42,543
Rigor mortis.

842
00:36:42,647 --> 00:36:44,511
You have a train to meet.

843
00:36:44,517 --> 00:36:45,522
You're in a hurry.

844
00:36:45,527 --> 00:36:47,360
And the sound of the shoulder popping.

845
00:36:54,348 --> 00:36:55,592
and elbow, like,

846
00:36:55,698 --> 00:36:57,333
knuckles popping...

847
00:36:58,005 --> 00:36:59,453
...only louder.

848
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:03,650
Sickening.

849
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:20,892
Turko will admit to helping Warren Lynch
place a dead body in Mr. Lynch's car

850
00:37:20,898 --> 00:37:24,360
and rigging it to burn
with the intent of moving the market.

851
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:27,622
Everything else, including
placing it on the tracks,

852
00:37:27,726 --> 00:37:29,493
he says Lynch did on his own.

853
00:37:29,496 --> 00:37:30,853
Then he's lying.

854
00:37:30,878 --> 00:37:32,783
There's a small matter
of proving that in court.

855
00:37:32,785 --> 00:37:34,551
What's the maximum sentence
on those charges?

856
00:37:34,556 --> 00:37:35,693
Ten years.

857
00:37:35,697 --> 00:37:37,543
He killed three people.

858
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:38,940
And put one in a coma.

859
00:37:38,945 --> 00:37:41,553
Yeah, but Lynch deserves to be in a coma,
so it doesn't count.

860
00:37:41,555 --> 00:37:43,172
All right, look, Turko puts
all the blame on Lynch,

861
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:46,091
he does ten years and he gets all the money
for shorting the stock.

862
00:37:46,295 --> 00:37:47,993
It's ten years or nothing.

863
00:37:48,196 --> 00:37:49,761
I can only work with what I'm given,

864
00:37:49,965 --> 00:37:52,173
and the forensic work
on this was not good enough.

865
00:37:52,776 --> 00:37:55,432
What?
You were fooled by fake dental records.

866
00:37:55,436 --> 00:37:56,822
You baked some spam.

867
00:37:56,928 --> 00:37:59,090
- What did you want us to do?
- Your jobs.

868
00:37:59,096 --> 00:37:59,803
Hey!

869
00:37:59,805 --> 00:38:01,830
No, Miss Supek, you want us to do your job.

870
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:03,363
My people gave you
all the evidence you need

871
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:04,883
to fry Turko with any reasonable jury.

872
00:38:04,887 --> 00:38:05,590
Forensically...

873
00:38:05,595 --> 00:38:07,780
we gave you everything
you need to arrest Turko.

874
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:08,930
Arrest in not a conviction.

875
00:38:08,937 --> 00:38:10,581
We definitely gave you
enough to reject

876
00:38:10,586 --> 00:38:12,652
his plea bargain and indict him
in the wrongful death of a senator.

877
00:38:12,656 --> 00:38:14,281
Indictment is not a conviction.

878
00:38:14,287 --> 00:38:15,641
You accept that plea bargain,

879
00:38:15,648 --> 00:38:16,842
the investigation stops.

880
00:38:16,847 --> 00:38:17,643
Indict him,

881
00:38:17,647 --> 00:38:19,252
give us time to give you
what you need.

882
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:20,381
If you accept this plea bargain,

883
00:38:20,387 --> 00:38:22,172
you don't deserve
to be a federal prosecutor.

884
00:38:22,275 --> 00:38:23,292
Dr. Saroyan...

885
00:38:23,295 --> 00:38:24,352
yeah, it's scary.

886
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:26,200
The whole country will be
watching the trial and you

887
00:38:26,205 --> 00:38:27,701
don't want to go in with
less than a sure thing.

888
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:30,141
But you put my people
on the stand as expert witnesses

889
00:38:30,145 --> 00:38:31,080
and that's a sure thing.

890
00:38:31,085 --> 00:38:32,060
Not Zack.

891
00:38:32,065 --> 00:38:33,521
You tell the story
of what happened,

892
00:38:33,526 --> 00:38:35,041
using the evidence
these people provided,

893
00:38:35,048 --> 00:38:37,550
and if you have any ability
as a prosecutor, you'll win the case.

894
00:38:37,557 --> 00:38:38,700
Are you finished?

895
00:38:38,708 --> 00:38:39,642
No, Miss Supek.

896
00:38:39,647 --> 00:38:41,681
In the future, when you have
problems with my team,

897
00:38:41,788 --> 00:38:43,663
you register them
with me in private,

898
00:38:43,668 --> 00:38:45,301
not by grandstanding
in a public forum.

899
00:38:58,677 --> 00:38:59,940
Okay...

900
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:02,540
um, I sort of see
why she got the job.

901
00:39:10,996 --> 00:39:12,731
Well, looks like
your brother was here.

902
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:15,761
Never understood the idea
of bringing flowers.

903
00:39:18,605 --> 00:39:21,290
Just for once, Bones,
do what people do, okay?

904
00:39:21,297 --> 00:39:22,483
See how it feels.

905
00:39:23,088 --> 00:39:24,823
Come on. That's it.

906
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:26,612
Now I'm gonna go stand over here

907
00:39:26,618 --> 00:39:28,110
while you, you know,
talk to your mom.

908
00:39:28,317 --> 00:39:30,780
I told you, I don't do that.

909
00:39:39,428 --> 00:39:41,643
Mom, it's me, Temperance.

910
00:39:50,116 --> 00:39:53,021
I have questions,
but you can't answer them.

911
00:39:53,028 --> 00:39:57,043
No offense, but I don't think
there's anything here of you

912
00:39:57,045 --> 00:39:58,531
but your bones, so...

913
00:40:01,287 --> 00:40:03,592
I can't believe I'm doing this.

914
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:12,833
Is dad a good man or...

915
00:40:15,718 --> 00:40:17,453
a bad man?

916
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,930
He had someone killed.

917
00:40:26,747 --> 00:40:28,871
Had him murdered and...

918
00:40:31,007 --> 00:40:32,312
what's the truth?

919
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:33,842
Do I...

920
00:40:35,026 --> 00:40:39,113
do I keep looking
or do I let it go like he asked?

921
00:40:41,936 --> 00:40:44,433
Who's he protecting, himself?

922
00:40:46,668 --> 00:40:49,882
Or me and Russ?

923
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:07,281
Booth.

924
00:41:07,485 --> 00:41:09,513
I asked the questions, and guess what.

925
00:41:11,455 --> 00:41:12,442
No answer.

926
00:41:12,545 --> 00:41:14,781
Well, maybe if you
weren't standing right on top of her,

927
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:16,902
took a step to the left,
showed just a little respect.

928
00:41:17,847 --> 00:41:20,482
Sometimes it takes
a while to get an answer, okay?

929
00:41:20,586 --> 00:41:22,171
Just leave the flowers.

930
00:41:25,476 --> 00:41:27,181
I get answers at a lab,

931
00:41:27,188 --> 00:41:28,540
you get them from people.

932
00:41:28,548 --> 00:41:30,773
Nobody gets answers from a slab of stone.

933
00:41:30,778 --> 00:41:32,230
Yeah, well, I see an answer in the stone.

934
00:41:32,235 --> 00:41:34,500
See, you buried your mother
as Christine Brennan;

935
00:41:34,506 --> 00:41:37,630
The woman that you knew
as your mother and not by her real name;

936
00:41:37,637 --> 00:41:38,592
Ruth Keenan.

937
00:41:39,637 --> 00:41:41,391
That tells me who you are.

938
00:41:48,378 --> 00:41:49,592
What do you got?

939
00:41:49,605 --> 00:41:51,380
A dolphin.

940
00:41:55,486 --> 00:41:57,183
What is that tell you?

941
00:41:57,586 --> 00:41:59,280
What does that tell you?

942
00:42:00,278 --> 00:42:01,690
My father was here.

943
00:42:02,427 --> 00:42:05,490
Because he loves your mother
and grieves her loss

944
00:42:05,497 --> 00:42:07,852
and he came here to talk to her.

945
00:42:11,486 --> 00:42:13,442
You're tainting evidence.

946
00:42:13,445 --> 00:42:15,353
It's not that kind of evidence, Bones.

947
00:42:15,655 --> 00:42:17,341
It's evidence of something else.

948
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:21,423
Something that can't be tainted.

949
00:42:34,226 --> 00:42:36,153
It's beautiful.

950
00:42:39,518 --> 00:42:40,860
Yeah.
