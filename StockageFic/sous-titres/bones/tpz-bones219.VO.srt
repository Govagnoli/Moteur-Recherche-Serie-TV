1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,071
[Lowing]

2
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:16,513
- <i>[Siren Chirps]</i>
- <i>[Booth] Can you make anything out?</i>

3
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,643
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>It's a crater.</i>

4
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:22,813
We know it's a crater, Bones.
The question is, what caused it?

5
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:24,823
You should ask a geologist.

6
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:27,553
- I can tell you for sure it's not a meteor.
- You got a look what's inside?

7
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:30,994
Not for long. State troopers didn't want anyone
getting near it until you people got here.

8
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,430
- That's very nice of them.
- But what did it look like?

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,559
Uh, I'm pretty sure it was meat.

10
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:40,470
Meat wearin' clothes.

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,670
- [Booth] What do you wanna do?
- Let's take a look.

12
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,916
Mmm.
So what do you think? Dead?

13
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:59,186
<i>I'm just saying, ifhe fell out of a plane,</i>
<i>that plane is long gone by now.</i>

14
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,988
No sign of a parachute.

15
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,825
- <i>What do those shoes look like to you?</i>
- <i>[Booth] Loafers.</i>

16
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,355
<i>He hit the ground at approximately</i>
<i>200 kilometers per hour.</i>

17
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,766
How can you tell that by his shoes?

18
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:12,600
124 miles per hour
is terminal velocity for a falling human.

19
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:15,664
So we're gonna go with the theory
that this was once human?

20
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,142
I've never read about an alien encounter
in which the aliens wore loafers.

21
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:21,806
How much you wanna bet Hodgins has?

22
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:26,615
[Saroyan] The crows and critters
sure made quick work of him.

23
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:31,055
Yeah, but these <i>Calliphora vicina</i> eggs
will confirm time of landing.

24
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,115
Blowflies on aliens.
Who knew?

25
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,559
You're taking a shot at me
because I happen to believe...

26
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,529
that we are not all alone
in an infinity of space?

27
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,863
It's not the believing
in extraterrestrial life that's odd.

28
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:45,302
- It's the believing that they're visiting us.
- This guy is wearing loafers.

29
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:48,238
<i>Aliens don't wear loafers, people.</i>

30
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:51,334
- Even if they wanna pass unnoticed amongst us?
- Before taking us over?

31
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,845
Oh.
Oh, this is harassment.

32
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,848
<i>You know, it's illegal to mock people</i>
<i>for their fundamental beliefs.</i>

33
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,976
Is the tissue damage
consistent with a long fall?

34
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,511
- Definitely.
- You've seen something like this before?

35
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,150
Suicide off the Chrysler Building.
At least this one didn't hit the pavement.

36
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:10,185
<i>A human being reaches terminal velocity</i>
<i>after falling 200 to 220 meters...</i>

37
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,561
<i>depending upon air resistance.</i>

38
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,430
Velocity would be achieved
between five and eight seconds...

39
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:19,199
<i>depending upon atmospheric conditions,</i>
<i>body position and clothing.</i>

40
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,900
He fell from a minimum of 1,200 feet.

41
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,342
- I can run through the math if you'd like.
- Send me an e-mail.

42
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:29,108
This is... I want to say "anomalous,"
but I'm going to go with "weird."

43
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:33,346
- [Saroyan] What's weird?
- These areas of radial lucency here and here.

44
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,114
- Extremely porous bones.
- What's that mean?

45
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,213
That means he was ill.

46
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,782
His right femoral head
shows significant demineralization.

47
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,452
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>Zack?</i>

48
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,726
- I'd put him at... 130.
- 130 what?

49
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,096
- Years.
- Old?

50
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,568
There's an alternate explanation.

51
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:54,937
- Then that's the one we should go with.
- He was in outer space.

52
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:59,138
And so he fell from outer space
in a pair of loafers?

53
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,109
Hodgins left too soon.

54
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:41,815
- [Device Buzzing]
- The F.A.A. reports no recent
accidents involving anyone...

55
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:45,449
falling from a plane, balloon or blimp,
commercial or otherwise.

56
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,358
The F.A.A. doesn't have jurisdiction
over the entire universe, my friend.

57
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:51,488
Little green men?

58
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,965
Gray. They're gray.
Not green... gray.

59
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,502
Being as you're half alien yourself,
you should know that.

60
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,870
If they dropped him from orbit, he'd have
burned up and his loafers would've fallen off.

61
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:05,672
<i>lfhe was an abductee tossed out</i>
<i>of an interplanetary spacecraft...</i>

62
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:10,148
why do his bones show that he has spent
an extended time in outer space?

63
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,208
The only rational explanation
is that he was an astronaut.

64
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,755
Astronauts lose two percent of their
bone mass for each month spent in space.

65
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,993
Our victim's legs, hips and lower vertebrae
have demineralized over 20%...

66
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,296
indicating 10 months in space.

67
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:33,066
- Do we do that?
- The longest shuttle flight was STS-80.

68
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,700
- 17.66 days in 1996.
- The longest we know of.

69
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,506
The man who spent the most time
in space was a Russian cosmonaut.

70
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,809
- That we know of.
- Why do you know that?

71
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:45,146
- My knowledge is vast.
- Why did I ask?

72
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:49,416
Anyway, there can't be all that many people
who have accumulated 10 months in space.

73
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,049
That we know of.

74
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,993
Call Booth. Tell him to see
if anyone's missing an astronaut.

75
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,164
Meet Colonel Calvin Howard...

76
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,894
senior training specialist
and crew liaison in the shuttle program.

77
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:06,166
<i>Currently working in the National</i>
<i>Space Agency in Bristol, Maryland.</i>

78
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:09,868
Angela just sent me her work in progress
of the partial skull reconstruction.

79
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,502
She says we expected
too much too soon.

80
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,376
But the shape of the head,
the cheekbones...

81
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,177
Close enough for jazz.

82
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,583
Six months on
the international space station.

83
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,521
Plus, a number of servicing missions
to both the Hubble and Lansing Telescopes.

84
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,888
Wait. Does that add up
to the right amount of bone rot?

85
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,918
Loss. Bone loss.
And... yes.

86
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,693
- Has anyone reported him missing?
- No, not exactly.

87
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:38,430
- Not exactly?
- Well, astronauts are regarded
as viable terror targets.

88
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,597
Their whereabouts
are extremely confidential.

89
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,436
I bet if you told the agency...

90
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,136
you were going to <i>identify</i> Howard to the press,
they'd be a little more cooperative.

91
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,441
Yeah. You know, I have been
a wonderful influence on you.

92
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,242
Well, actually,
I learned that move from Cam.

93
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:52,910
Well, I went the other way with it, okay?
Looked up his wife in the phone book.

94
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:01,151
Did my husband die in
some kind of training accident?

95
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,491
- We don't believe so, ma'am. No.
- It couldn't have been.

96
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,828
- How do you know that?
- Because the Space Agency would be all over this.

97
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,562
<i>You're probably right. They wouldn't</i>
<i>let anybody else take the lead, not even us.</i>

98
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:14,265
You say your husband left
the day before yesterday?

99
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,433
- On what airline?
- Cal flies himself.

100
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:21,173
- What kind of plane?
- He has a turboprop Cessna out at McNichol.

101
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:26,310
What exactly does a senior
training specialist and crew liaison do?

102
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,150
Um, we're not supposed
to discuss these things.

103
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,247
For the past three years,
Cal's been training others to go up.

104
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:35,090
- Because he lost his medical clearance?
- How did you know that?

105
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:39,655
His X-rays show that he was suffering
from a dramatic loss of bone density.

106
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,723
Must've been hard on the colonel...

107
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,031
training others to do
what he loved to do.

108
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:47,539
No.
Cal was a team player.

109
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,838
He was training her husband, James,
for almost a year.

110
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,970
- Actually, it was hard on him.
- It would be hard on any of them.

111
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:57,538
All they ever do is think
about going back into space...

112
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,609
<i>and all we ever think about</i>
<i>is getting 'em back home.</i>

113
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:04,178
<i>Is there some kind of rule</i>
<i>that astronauts' wives travel in packs?</i>

114
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,316
When you marry an astronaut,
no one really understands except...

115
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:10,658
Except other people
who are in the same situation.

116
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,357
This is Cal's itinerary, uh...

117
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,129
mainly when he intended to call me and...
[Inhales]

118
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:19,228
when he'd be back.

119
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,569
You expected
your husband home today?

120
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,041
Yeah.

121
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,205
[Sniffles]

122
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,720
<i>Yeah, I just need to know</i>
<i>if it's still in the hangar or not.</i>

123
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,418
It's a Cessna turboprop plane
registered to Colonel Calvin Howard.

124
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,427
Thanks.

125
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,589
It just seems so odd.
Those women stick together like a harem.

126
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,657
What? They support each other, you know?
A lot of service wives are like that.

127
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:50,395
Well, what about astronauts' husbands?

128
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,563
Look, their husbands train
for years, Bones, all right?

129
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,436
- Their families invest their entire lives.
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

130
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,738
Yeah?

131
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,744
Are you sure?
Okay, great.

132
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,076
Thanks.
Well, plane's still in the hangar.

133
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:06,380
Well, if that's the plane he got tossed
out of, then it didn't fly itself back.

134
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:14,021
If someone simply pushed him out of
the plane, there might not be any evidence.

135
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:17,620
We have to hope there was a struggle.

136
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,393
<i>Excuse me.</i>
<i>Can I see some I.D., please?</i>

137
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,900
Well, yeah, sure.
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

138
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,529
Right.
Here you go.

139
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,802
That airplane belongs to the agency.

140
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,571
Our information is that it belongs
to Colonel Calvin Howard.

141
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:35,273
- The agency leased it to him.
- Well, it's being investigated
as a possible crime scene.

142
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,782
- You were Colonel Howard's boss?
- Yes.

143
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,251
Nina Sanborn. I carry a rank
equivalent to an air force general.

144
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,756
Hmm. Why didn't you report
him missing, General Sanborn?

145
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,452
Equivalent, I said.
I'm a civilian.

146
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:53,227
Cal was... Colonel Howard wasn't missing.
He was barely gone a day.

147
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,097
<i>General Sanborn, I know you people</i>
<i>are really tight-lipped.</i>

148
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:59,228
But I'm really good friends
with a very aggressive federal prosecutor...

149
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,205
who's great at getting warrants.

150
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:05,142
<i>Agent Booth?</i>
<i>I got the usual fibers, hair, particulates.</i>

151
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,645
No blood?
No sign of a struggle?

152
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,647
Nothing. You'll have my full report
by the end of the day.

153
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,742
Great. Okay. I need to know what Colonel Howard
was working on at the time of his death.

154
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:17,585
Get your warrant, Agent Booth.
Dr. Brennan.

155
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:22,321
Hey, excuse me,
"equivalent to a general" Sanborn.

156
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,464
- I got that warrant.
- Why didn't you just tell her right away?

157
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,366
Well, I was hoping that
we could all be friends.

158
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,427
Let me see that.

159
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,504

160
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,445
These are the documents
you subpoenaed from the agency?

161
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,310
Yeah, but all the info's blacked out.

162
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,282
- Want me to see if I can
get anything out of this?
- Can you?

163
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,445
No. I'd need originals.
These are photocopies.

164
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,291
- Then why'd you offer?
- Well, why else would you ask me here?

165
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,023
'Cause you're a conspiracy nut, and
I thought you'd enjoy filling in the blanks.

166
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,156
- With paranoid ravings?
- It's better than nothing.

167
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:04,032
- Lansing Telescope. That mean anything to you?
- Yeah.

168
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,095
It's a multigazillion-dollar, deep space...

169
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,700
multifrequency telescope
that keeps needing "repairs."

170
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,506
- Why'd you say it like that?
- It doesn't need repairs.

171
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,841
There's no rust in space.

172
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:22,286
So-called "repair crews" are up there
retrieving classified information.

173
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:28,123
Classified information, huh? The telescope
is pointed up at the planet Pluto.

174
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,526
Pluto's no longer a planet.
It was demoted.

175
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,621
And if the Lansing was pointed
away from the Earth...

176
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,723
why would they need
to black out all this material?

177
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,667
- Huh.
- Can I ask you a question?

178
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:41,002
Yeah.

179
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,633
What's the deal on proposing to,
you know, a woman?

180
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,611
- Oh!
- I mean, what is the absolute
proper way to do it?

181
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,376
I don't know.
The one time I did it, I got shot down flat.

182
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,885
- Did you do it by the book?
- Mm-hmm. Well, no.

183
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,751
We were waitin' for the stick
to turn blue or not to turn blue...

184
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:01,418
and I realized I wanted to marry her
if the stick was blue or not.

185
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,260
Yeah. That's sort of what I did,
only without the sticks.

186
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,231
You asked Angela to marry you?

187
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,859
- Apparently, I didn't do it right.
- Do it again.

188
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,869
Go all out this time, right...

on one knee, the violin.

190
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,500
Forget the violin.

Hey, hey, hey.
With his bone density...

192
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,279
Colonel Howard sure as hell
wasn't going back into space again.

193
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,751
Yeah, I know.
That's why he was training his replacement.

194
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,415
- His replacement? For what?
- To repair the Lansing Telescope.

195
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,857
Oh! Brothers in arms, my brother.

196
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:38,658
That replacement's the guy who can tell you
things the agency doesn't want you to know.

197
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,722
Eh.

198
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:53,009
- Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
- Because the picture's so big?

199
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,979
No, because the universe is so big.

200
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,983
You're not looking at the universe. You're
looking at an enlarged photograph of Earth.

201
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,817
Well, you see one thing, and I see
another thing. Personally, I like what <i>I see.

- All right, look.

209
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:26,072
You don't know anyone who would want
to throw him out of a plane?

210

Look, I don't mean
to tell you your work...

211
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:32,139
but shouldn't you be tracking down everyone who
flew over that particular piece of real estate?

212
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,152
We are.
But not everyone files flight plans.

213
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,017
And not everyone sticks
to flight plans.

214

And you didn't answer the question.

Look, I don't know anyone

Look, sir, I understand

219
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,032
But Cal Howard and Jean Marie
were a very solid couple.

220
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,697
- Did you ever get drunk together?
- What?

221
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,368
What my partner is trying to ask
is if you two were buddies.

222
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,139
<i>Did you go out and have drinks</i>
<i>and exchange confidences?</i>

223
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:03,807
- Yes. That's what I asked.
- Yeah, sure. Of course, at times.

224
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,147
So you would've known if
his marriage was in trouble?

225
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,686
- Yes, sir, I would.
- How can you be sure?

[Man On Headset, Indistinct]

227
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:15,151
Because Cal knew when
I was unfaithful to my wife.

228
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:18,993
- Colleen?
- Right. You guys met her at Cal's place.

<i>Look.</i>
<i>That has to stay between us.</i>

230
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,497
Strictly between us.

231
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,337
Cal Howard was my friend,
my colleague and my teacher.

232
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:33,003
If somebody tossed him from an airplane,
I'll do whatever I can to help.

I believe you were about

00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,745
Cal was talking to the S.T.C.

244

- The what?
- Space Travel Coalition.

245
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,355
It's a privately funded space exploration
and tourism group. And did you?

- [Together] Did we what?
- Vomit in the comet?

No, I didn't vomit.
Okay, I'm sure they were trying.

They can try me anytime.
It was truly amazing.

You had a little bit
too much fun, okay?

Construct a three-dimensional hypothesis

Are you certain you can't do
what needs to be done with X-rays alone?

Do you need continued access
to the soft tissue?

270
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:12,237
Why would the body burst vertically
when all the forces are horizontal?

271
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,932
Ah. So you need more time with
the soft tissue to answer that?

272
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,202
Not really.

273
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:20,268
Please explain to me your reluctance
to remove the flesh from the bones.

Hey, Bones, I ran a check on S.T.C.

284

- They're part of the tinfoil hat squad.
- What's that?

285
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,709
They wear tin little hats.

- <i>Probably to keep aliens</i>
<i>from controlling their minds.</i>
- Oh. Schizophrenics?

287
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,280
It's hard to believe that Colonel Howard
was part of an organization like that.

288
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,259
Do they have access to planes?

289
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:12,923
Access? Are you kidding me?
They actually have a border patrol division.

290
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,966
"Members fly their own private planes...

291
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,628

in search of U.F.O.'s."

292
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,934
- Do they file flight plans?
- Bones, you're a genius.

293
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,600
Look, two nights ago,
they had planes on U.F.O. patrol...

294
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:27,475
within spitting distance of where
Colonel Howard's body was found.

Look, we're not a collection of kooks.

00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:40,121
Just ordinary people with a mission to promote
a friendly liaison with the visitors.

297
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,353
That's quite a manifesto.

298
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,794
Until you've had an encounter,
you couldn't possibly understand.

299
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:47,593
- You've been abducted?
- Multiple times.

300
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:51,568
- Mm-hmm.
- Through hypnosis, I discovered
that medical testing was done.

301
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:57,041
- And follow-ups were required.
- Are there any side effects
from these medical procedures?

302
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,077
You mean like tin hats?

303
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:04,241
Paranoia, outbursts of anger,
loss of connection with reality?

304
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,546
You asked me to come.
I'm here.

305
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:10,145

00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,060
Similar to post-traumatic stress disorder.

309
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,895
- P.A.S. is very real.
- I admit to bouts with it.

310
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,900
Frankly, it's one of my main motivators.

311

<i>When we meet the visitors face to face,</i>
<i>they will explain so many things to us.</i>

313
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,240

316
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,649
<i>So it's true that you offered him</i>
<i>a position with the S. T. C?</i>

00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,516
Yes.

318
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,556
As a method of bringing credibility
to your organization?

319
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:48,753
Yes. But you have to understand,
it was Colonel Howard who came to us.

320
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,819
- Why?
- He wanted to pilot our suborbital flights.

321
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:56,994
Till your spaceships were ready,
he was gonna help you look for the U.F.O.'s?

322
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:01,028
Laugh if you must,
but Cal didn't think we were crazy.

323
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:04,200
He'd seen something himself up there,
you know? And he's hardly the first.

324
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:08,337
<i>Quite a few astronauts and military pilots</i>
<i>have reported seeing evidence of the visitors.</i>

325
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,540
- Colonel Howard told you this?
- Yes, he did.

326
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:15,110
So trust me, I would've been proud to have been
the one to send Cal Howard back into space.

327
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:19,146
- Would've been?
- He changed his mind six weeks ago.

328
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,988
That didn't make you a little angry?

329
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,029
No, not angry.
Disappointed.

330
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:28,430
Great. Then you wouldn't object to my partner
and I taking a look at your fleet of planes?

331
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,263
No, not at all.

332
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,600
Why do you think Colonel Howard
changed his mind?

333
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,573
They got to him...
through his wife, I believe.

334
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,872
- "They"?
- The agency.

335
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:42,209
- <i>They can be very persuasive.</i>
- Persuasive?

336
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,375
In my opinion,
the agency would rather have Cal die...

337
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,918
than have him announce to
the world he'd seen a visitor.

338
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,754
<i>That's not true.</i>
<i>The agency loved Cal.</i>

339
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,555
- <i>They valued him.</i>
- Why didn't you tell us about S.T. C?

340
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,256
Because it's embarrassing.

341
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,960
Cal wanted to get back into space so badly,
he would even listen to those crazy people.

342
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,094
Did your husband
see something up there?

343
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,469
Yeah, something that made him
sympathetic with Mr. Bahr's organization?

344
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,839
Well, obviously you know
that he did, or he said he did.

345
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,606
- And you doubted him?
- <i>It doesn't really matter now, you know?</i>

346
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,808
That was three years ago.
It was his last mission...

347
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,875
and the agency explained it
in such a way that Cal was satisfied.

348
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,148
Look, it's important we know the truth,
Miss Howard.

349
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,520
[Sighs]
Why?

350
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:28,788
<i>Because what I've seen,</i>
<i>your husband was a man of principle.</i>

351
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,920
<i>And ifhe saw something, he wouldn't just</i>
<i>back down to save his career with the agency...</i>

352
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,431
<i>even ifhis wife begged him to.</i>

353
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:42,597
He insisted on filing an official report.
He wouldn't withdraw it.

354
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,505
- They asked him to?
- <i>Yes.</i>

355
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,374
But he stuck by his story.
They weren't happy with him.

356
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,971
But like I said,
that's ancient history.

357
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:58,387
<i>Cal's friend knew about the S. T.C.</i>
<i>His wife knew. Maybe the agency did as well.</i>

358
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,652
So they killed him by tossing him
out of an airplane?

359
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:04,025
That field is less than
a mile from the coastline.

360
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,496
Obviously, they were aiming
at the ocean and they missed.

361
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:10,160
The question is why. I mean, it's
a big ocean, right? There has to be a reason.

362
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,465
Maybe it wasn't a U.F.O. that Cal saw.

363
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,402
- Ah.
- He could've seen something else.

364
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:18,239
Oh, yeah, like a death beam
or a space baby.

365
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:22,974
I was thinking more along the lines of
a spy satellite or experimental technology.

366
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,676
Maybe the agency was afraid...

367
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,584
that Cal was sharing
sensitive information with the S.T.C.

368
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,589
Well, regardless, our government
does not kill people. Okay, Bones?

369
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:34,217
[Scoffs]
You were a sniper.

370
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,660
<i>Wasn't it our government</i>
<i>who sent you to kill people?</i>

371
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,495
Just saying.

372
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:44,034
[Sighs]

373
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,796
<i>[Liquid Bubbling]</i>

374
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,340
Mmm!
Something smells good.

375
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,174
Help yourself.

376
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:02,081
[Groans]
Those definitely human bones?

377
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:06,557
Because apparently, there are
a few types of aliens... races, if you will.

378
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,752
One is quite reptilian,
widely known as Greys.

379
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:12,126
- Definitely human.
- Another's bone structure's more amphibian.

380
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,631
These bones are as human
as you are.

381
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,931
If you only knew
how irony-packed that is.

382
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,233
It's a joke.

383
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:23,604
Don't you be coming around
to boil me in the middle of the night.

384
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:28,442
There's a strange callus formation
on his right femoral head.

385
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,743
Also, bone marrow edema
in the same spot.

386
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,477
- Healing from a fracture?
- <i>No.</i>

387
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,714
It's some kind
of tuberous cortical defect.

388
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,721
I've never seen anything
like this before.

389
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:42,590
- Now you're freaking me out.
- I have to get Dr. Brennan to take a look at this.

390
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:47,121
It looks like he was in
the initial stages of osteonecrosis.

391
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,394
What did you get
from the tox screen?

392
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:55,270
Excess levels of vitamins
"D," "K," "E," "A," and "C"...

393
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,901
along with glutamine peptides
and creatine monohydrate.

394
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,912
<i>[Zack] All the supplements he was taking</i>
<i>before his last space mission.</i>

395
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,438
There's something odd about
the texture of this bone.

396
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,985
Leucine, isoleucine and valine.

397
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,987
He foresaw going back into space.

398
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,388
- This is not bone.
- <i>[Zack] What is it?</i>

399
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:17,417
A callus has formed over
some kind of thick, porous substance.

400
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:22,024
- Careful.
- It's an implant of some kind.

401
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,694
I never saw anything on the X-rays.

402
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,432
<i>How could that not show up on X-rays?</i>

403
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,270
What the hell is this?

404
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,948
<i>Zoantharia</i> of the order <i>Sclerotinia.</i>

405
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:41,042
<i>Sclerotinia</i> has a calcium
carbonate exoskeleton...

406
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,053
with a porosity
similar to human bone.

407
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:45,055
Which would make it biocompatible.

408
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:46,920
- So it wouldn't show up on X-rays.
- Wait.

409
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,460
So this is coral, like from a reef?

410
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:53,225
Suspended in a biphasic
hydroxylapatite calcium phosphate coating.

411
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:56,461
Theoretically, the calcium
from the exoskeleton would grow...

412
00:23:56,535 --> 00:24:00,904
hopefully overcoming the loss
of his degenerating bone.

413
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,837
Then this attachment would be...

414
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,570
<i>An electromagnetic device</i>
<i>implanted to accelerate growth.</i>

415
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:08,704
<i>So it's a combination</i>
<i>ofhuman and alien technology.</i>

416
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,408
Don't say that to Booth.
But if that's the case...

417
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:14,281
then all the vitamins and amino acids
he was loaded up with...

418
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:17,150
- were mainly to ward off infection.
- And he'd need them too.

419
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:22,057
Bone marrow's highly susceptible.
This is a very risky procedure.

420
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,425
I gotta say it.
Frank Olson.

421
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,021
He was a U.S. Army scientist in the '50s...

422
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,692
and an unwitting participant
in Project MK-ULTRA.

423
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:34,364
<i>They said he committed suicide,</i>
<i>but an exhumation</i>
<i>45 years later proved he was murdered.</i>

424
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:38,739
You need more.
Project Paperclip, MK-Artichoke.

425
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,278
<i>And who could forget Tuskegee?</i>

426
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:44,179
The government experiments on people,
and then abandons them or worse.

427
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,183
What's the point of this experiment?

428
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:50,085
The main obstacle to long-term
space travel is bone demineralization.

429
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,056
If the space program
could overcome this one effect...

430
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:55,058
their funding would triple overnight.

431
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:59,722
<i>Well, there you go.</i>
<i>Experimental program for deep space fails...</i>

432
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:01,663
and the evidence
has to be gotten rid of.

433
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:05,863
<i>By tossing it from a plane? Why notjust</i>
<i>have the visitors toss him into the sun?</i>

434
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:08,599
- That... is a good question.
- <i>[Saroyan] No, it's not.</i>

435
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:12,040
Sometimes when people try to cover
things up, it goes wrong. That's all.

436
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,444
<i>First thing we should do</i>
<i>is find out the source of this technology.</i>

437
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:22,381
<i>[Sanborn] Colonel Reed was Cal's</i>
<i>commanding officer on three missions.</i>

438
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,945
So you were the person to whom
he reported the U.F.O. sighting?

439
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,991
Oh, for God's sake.

440
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:30,687
You see what happens? You people
get all secretive about things and...

441
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:33,458
What Cal saw was space junk.

442
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,558
<i>It was satellite parts,</i>
<i>a discarded hatch, a screwdriver.</i>

443
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,569
That information isn't cleared.

444
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:41,265
- Sounded like more than a screwdriver.
- <i>Well, it wasn't.</i>

445
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,170
Cal just thought
we should be able to explain...

446
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:46,074
why it was whizzing around space
at 25,000 miles an hour.

447
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:51,514
- <i>And that's all.</i>
- Was Colonel Howard in a cast recently?

448
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:54,074
Last winter. Said he broke his leg
parasailing in the Caribbean.

449
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:57,019
All of our astronauts
suffer from brittle bones.

450
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:00,546
I stepped off a ladder once,
and my tibia snapped like a twig.

451
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:03,526
- Why do you ask?
- Because of this.

452
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:06,291
We found it in Colonel Howard's leg.

453
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:09,800
<i>We think it's designed to counteract</i>
<i>the effects of osteonecrosis.</i>

454
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:13,429
Experimental surgery on one of
our astronauts? Absolutely not.

455
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:16,030
Our efforts to counter
bone loss are limited...

456
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:18,541
to strength and resistance training
and supplements.

457
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,544
I trust you have documentation?

458
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,046
Follow me.

459
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:25,207
<i>Thank you.</i>

460
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,812
Colonel?
Have you ever seen anything?

461
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:33,051
Any screwdrivers up there?

462
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:36,287
There's an awful lot up there
to see, Doctor.

463
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:39,387
- The trick is not to let it cloud your judgment.
- Did it ever cloud Cal's?

464
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:41,295
Never.
Not once.

465
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:44,961
And yet he wanted
to go back into space so badly...

466
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:49,234
in spite of the physical damage
it had caused him, the pain he was in.

467
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:51,571
Let me show you something.

468
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:57,243
You see this? That's me.
And that there, that's Cal.

469
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,943
Twenty minutes I spent
out there that day...

470
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,418
and it is the last thing
I think about every night.

471
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:06,480
- I can imagine.
- No. All due respect, you really can't.

472
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,824
This was the best moment of my life,
counting marriage, kids, everything.

473
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,329
<i>I'm not saying</i>
<i>that's good or right...</i>

474
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,423
but I do know
it was the same for Cal...

475
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,764
for all of us who went up there.

476
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:20,202
And we would do anything
we could to get back.

477
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,133
<i>[Hodgins]</i>
<i>This coral's growth was aided artificially.</i>

478
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:29,146
It was seeded with
resin beads on glass plates.

479
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,910
Which makes it rare enough
to trace to a pharmaceutical supply house...

480
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,917
based in Geneva, Switzerland.

481
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,919
I searched the literature.

482
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,683
There's a number of clinics and researchers
working on bone replacement.

483
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:43,694
The doctor most likely to have performed this
procedure on our victim is Dr. Henry Pascal.

484
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:47,596
- In Switzerland?
- Based in Bethesda, with a clinic in Haiti.

485
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:51,033
Plus, he worked for the Space Agency
until 1998.

486
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:55,061
- What happened?
- He lost his funding and turned
to the private sector.

487
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,108
Namely, the Space Travel Coalition.

488
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:01,942
The foil hat squad funds this guy?
Booth is gonna love that.

489
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,414
- Why?
- Because he doesn't believe in coincidences.

490
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,553
<i>[Jean Marie]</i>
<i>Cal wasn't on vacation when he hurt his leg.</i>

491
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,954
He was in Haiti for a convention.

492
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:16,187
Can you think of any reason Colonel Reed
would tell us a different story?

493
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:19,230
No.
Please, what... what's going on?

494
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:22,466
We found evidence
in your husband's remains...

495
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:26,436
that he underwent
an experimental surgery in Haiti.

496
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:28,438
What kind of
experimental surgery?

497
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:31,100
- To replace his bone loss.
- Does that sound like him?

498
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:35,442
- Yes.
- Was it like your husband
to keep it a secret from you?

499
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:38,778
Yes.

500
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,011
Cal wouldn't want me to worry.

501
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:47,752
Cal Howard's skeleton before...

502
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,885
and after he fell to Earth.

503
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:55,524
Every bone showed trauma.

504
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,262
His clothing before...

505
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,431
and after he fell to Earth.

506
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:05,203
Ripped.
Every seam pulled apart.

507
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:08,302
If I make the clothing translucent...

508
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:15,812
<i>we can see that some of the clothing damage</i>
<i>lines up with the trauma to his skeleton.</i>

509
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:19,050
And if you isolate the bone damage
caused by a device capable...

510
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:22,287
<i>of making robust cuts</i>
<i>in a linear path...</i>

511
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,157
- The guy was chopped.
- Chopped?

512
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,720
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Clothing damage, flesh wounds...</i>

513
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,959
Bone damage.
He was chopped.

514
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:34,232
<i>Ange, tonight, you and me,</i>
<i>reservations at Les Deux Copains, 8:00.</i>

515
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,364
Wow. Fancy.

516
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:40,741
- Suit-and-gown fancy, baby.
So leave your mukluks at home.
- What's the occasion?

517
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,838
<i>An ax or a hatchet or a machete</i>
<i>make sharp, well-defined cuts.</i>

518
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:46,907
- These edges are abraded.
- This our guy?

519
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:50,887
- Hey, do aliens use any weapons resembling a...
- A broadsword?

520
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:54,652
- How about a light saber?
- No. Those can cut through any known substance.

521
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,819
<i>The victim would've been</i>
<i>completely dismembered.</i>

522
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:59,489
If they existed, Zack.

523
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:03,330
Makeup, hair done, high heels...
the whole enchilada.

524
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,995
Only whatever's French for enchilada.

525
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,368
No mukluks.
Got it.

526
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,905
Oh.

527
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:16,879
Dr. Pascal,
Colonel Calvin Howard is dead.

528
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,850
Not because of anything I did.

529
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:23,410
- Wow. Didn't even blink.
- Colonel Howard sought me out.

530
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,219
- May I know how he died?
- Let's just say it was a really bad fall.

531
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,750
- And what's this got to do with me?
- Was your procedure a success?

532
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,390
- How do you define success?
- Just answer the question.

533
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:38,094
- That's actually a fair question.
- The results were heartening.

534
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,763
There were extremely painful calluses
growing over your implant.

535
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,704
I'd very much like to see that.

536
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:46,437
And there was no indication
of an actual reversal of necrosis.

537
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,843
The calluses were part
of the healing process.

538
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:53,475
See, coral resorption is slow but effective
as a scaffold for osteoprogenitor cells.

539
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:56,315
Incorporating the electrode
was speeding the process.

540
00:30:56,387 --> 00:31:00,949
In my opinion, Cal was only months away
from having mature lamellar bone.

541
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:04,791
- No way to know for sure now. Right?
- Correct.

542
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,764
<i>Probably to your benefit to terminate</i>
<i>your experiment before it went wrong.</i>

543
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:10,630
Keep those venture capitalists
on the edge of their seats.

544
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:14,103
[Chuckles] You think I...
I pushed Colonel Howard off a ladder?

545
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,299
Or out of an airplane.

546
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:22,846
Look, you can have all my data,
my projections, everything.

547
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:27,408
Colonel Howard goes on the next shuttle
mission to repair the Lansing Telescope...

548
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,453
I'm in every medical journal
in the country.

549
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,616
That mission's a month away.
Would his body have been ready?

550
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,591
At the rate Cal was healing,
I believe so.

551
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,685
Did anyone at the agency
know about this?

552
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:41,664
We were gonna petition them
officially next month.

553
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,760
Look, you may not like me,
but I was his savior and he was mine.

554
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,665
I didn't kill Colonel Howard.

555
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,648
- Somebody's lying to us, right?
- Yeah.

556
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:01,378
- Maybe everybody.
- Well, this is your strength.

557
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:04,888
- Reading people's minds,
telling when they're lying.
- My strength? Wait a second.

558
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,947
The trouble is... No, no.
You haven't given me anything...

559
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,789
that I can spring on the suspect
to see how he reacts.

560
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:11,692
- Like what?
- Like a murder weapon.

561
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,061
Or whether the poor bastard was dead
before he hit the ground.

562
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,828
- Zack and Angela say he was.
- Well, that's something. Dead how?

563
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,495
- Best guess right now, a broadsword.
- Broadsword?

564
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,130
- Like King Arthur?
- Yes.

565
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,071
Broadsword?

566
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,576
You know what? Bones,
I like the whole alien thing much better.

567
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:29,374
Broadsword? Where do you people
come up with this stuff?

568
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:33,144
I didn't say an actual broadsword.
I said <i>like</i> a broadsword.

569
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,515
It was the closest analog I could access.

570
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,213
No traces from the weapon
left on the bone?

571
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:40,086
Traces are left when the weapon
cuts deeply into the bone.

572
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,388
<i>Whatever this was wasn't very sharp.</i>

573
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,020
- Left nothing behind.
- How about shape?

574
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:48,259
<i>[Angela] The pattern is consistent</i>
<i>with sharp force trauma...</i>

575
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:52,099
from a curved blade
approximately 65 millimeters thick.

576
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:56,368
And if I am late for dinner, I will find
whatever it is and I will hit you with it.

577
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:59,376
Wow.
You... You look incredible.

578
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:03,073
- <i>[Brennan] You really do.</i>
- You know what else I can tell
just by looking at you?

579
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,876
<i>You smell great.</i>

580
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,247
You cannot see smell.

581
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,343
The victim was struck four times.

582
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,584
<i>A glancing blow to the head,</i>
<i>right humerus, thoracic and left femur.</i>

583
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:17,389
We couldn't figure out in what order.
It's almost as though it was simultaneous.

584
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,726
- The blow to the head is what killed him.
- Come on.

585
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,560
Four hits simultaneously
with a broadsword?

586
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:23,566
Was he attacked by
the Knights of the Round Table?

587
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:27,764
Sixty-five millimeters is too thick for a sword.
Did you estimate a velocity?

588
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,070
The blade was moving at a velocity
of approximately 116 meters per second.

589
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:34,407
- What's that in American?
- About 260 miles per hour.

590
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,175
All right, look. I'm no expert
in broadswords, but I do know...

591
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,944
I know what happened!

592
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,579
- How fast does a propeller turn?
- At full speed, the tips
approach the speed of sound.

593
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:46,487
But Howard exits
the airplane in flight.

594
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,582
<i>The propeller is ahead ofhim</i>
<i>and pulling away.</i>

595
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:51,127
- <i>How could he come into contact with it?</i>
- There are pusher propellers.

596
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,926
- It didn't happen in the air.
- He was pushed into a propeller?

597
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,990
He would've turned into steak tartar.

598
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,059
<i>Scratch one item off the menu tonight.</i>

599
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,162
Not if the plane was idling.

600
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,673
Propeller speeds would decrease
to a thousand or so R.P.M.'s.

601
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,971
- Let's go.
- Where?

602
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,775
- To look for a dented propeller. Come on.
- Which you do not need me for.

603
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,684
Hey. You're right.
Here they come.

604
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:19,288
I hope you have another warrant.

605
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:22,383
This is for the, uh... the hangar,
but not the individual planes.

606
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,758
Then why are your people
looking at propellers?

607
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:27,263
Because the warrant includes
anything that is in plain sight.

608
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:30,323
"Plane" sight.
[Chuckles] Get it?

609
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:34,667
- It's a pun.
- Yeah. This is not the only hangar
we'll be checking out.

610
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,004
- What plane are you looking for specifically?
- We'll know it when we see it.

611
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,136
We believe that Colonel Howard
was struck by a propeller.

612
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:44,306
We're looking for blood stains
using alternate light sources.

613
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,942
You think Cal walked into a propeller?

614
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,350
No way he makes
a bonehead move like that.

615
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,980
- We surmise he was pushed.
- But why?

616
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:56,550
<i>Here he was, this great guy.</i>
<i>But he was a liability to one of you.</i>

617
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:59,528
- One of us?
- Somebody wanted him dead.

618
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,859
That's ridiculous.

619
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,196
If it turned out Cal was able
to reverse his bone loss...

620
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,201
would you put him
on the next shuttle?

621
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,863
You know, the one to repair
the Lansing Telescope again.

622
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,908
- Colonel Adams is slated for that mission.
- Colonel Reed?

623
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:13,637
Well, Cal would be
my first choice, yes.

624
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:17,670
<i>All due respect, James, but why send</i>
<i>the student when the teacher can go?</i>

625
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:20,182
Look, I take no offense.
Cal was the best.

626
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,242
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Dr. Brennan, Agent Booth.</i>

627
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:28,721
- Blood. A lot of it.
- It was washed down this drain here.

628
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,819
- High-pressure hose.
- Can you tell which plane's
propeller may have done this?

629
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,989
Not within the parameters
of the current warrant.

630
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:37,762
Some of these planes have covers on the
propellers, so we can't see if they're damaged.

631
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:40,303
That is your plane, isn't it, James?

632
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:48,005
- Take it off.
- Take off the cover, James.

633
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,445
I respectfully decline.

634
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:54,417
It's not his plane.
It's the agency's.

635
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,114
A propeller like that
wouldn't get you very far.

636
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:06,255
- Certainly not over the water.
- Which is why you had to dump
Cal's body short of the ocean.

637
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:10,790
Booth! Booth!
It doesn't make sense.

638
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,234
The whole thing would take
at least two people.

639
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:17,035
Putting the body in the plane, cleaning up
the blood, shoving the body out of the plane.

640
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,633
Who are you protecting?

641
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:31,084
<i># [Soft Rock]</i>

642
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:42,256
Mrs. Howard?
Is Colleen here?

643
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:47,100
<i>Colleen came to see me off.</i>
<i>Saw me talking to Cal.</i>

644
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:50,902
He was telling me that he was going
to be okay in time for the mission.

645
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,443
He was sharing good news.

646
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,906
But it wasn't good, not to me.

647
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,080
<i>She slapped him. That's all.</i>

648
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:05,679
<i>Because she loves me.</i>

649
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:08,782
<i>She knew what it meant to me</i>
<i>not to go up.</i>

650
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,761
<i>Cal took a step back.</i>

651
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,321
<i>Just one.</i>

652
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,333
He fell back into the propeller.

653
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,461
Why didn't you just say
it was an accident?

654
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:23,769
I don't know. We panicked.
I mean, would they believe us?

655
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,537
- <i>Would they understand?</i>
- Would you ever get into space?

656
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:35,110
<i>[Adams] It happened because</i>
<i>my friend shared good news with me...</i>

657
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:38,280
<i>and because my wife loves me.</i>

658
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,692
I'm a blessed man.

659
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:50,326
<i># [Continues]</i>

660
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:30,374
- <i># [Ends]</i>
- <i>[Angela, Hodgins Chuckling]</i>

661
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:35,270
How-How are you feeling?

662
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:38,179
- What do you mean?
- It's a good meal.

663
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,410
Nice bottle of wine.

664
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,317
You feeling loving?

665
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:46,413
You didn't need to do all of this
to get me in a loving mood.

666
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,391
I don't mean in that way.

667
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,395
I am madly
in love with you, Angela.

668
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:56,524
You-You are the most amazing
woman that I have ever met.

669
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,468
My life is so much better since we...

670
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,597
- Oh, my God.
- What?

671
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,301
Are you breaking up with me?

672
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:09,073
Why would I get you all dressed up
for dinner just to break up?

673
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,543
I don't know.

674
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:16,712
Because you're...
I'm not thinking straight. Go ahead.

675
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,778
You know, I had this
all laid out in my mind.

676
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,790
- Mm-hmm.
- You are an upsetting woman.

677
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,156
- I'm sorry.
- [Chuckles]

678
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,695
Please, go ahead.

679
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,731
I believe that if two people
care enough for each other...

680
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,403
<i>the rest of the world</i>
<i>disappears to them.</i>

681
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:44,175
I feel that when I'm with you.

682
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:55,787
I'm prepared to put you ahead of me
for the rest of my life.

683
00:39:57,428 --> 00:40:01,831
Angela Montenegro,
will you marry me?

684
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:18,437
Dear man, good heart.

685
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,818
No.

686
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:25,988
Why?

687
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,354
I didn't do it right again.

688
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,621
But... How...

689
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:35,125
- Oh, you're not gonna tell me.
- I don't know, Hodgins.

690
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,394
<i>If I knew, I would tell you.</i>

691
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:42,997
But when you ask me,
I have to have this... this feeling.

692
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,166
It has to be...

693
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:51,647
I'll know it when it happens.

694
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:54,843
<i>And I hope you won't stop trying.</i>

695
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:58,013
I don't know if I should laugh,
cry, or punch out the sommelier.

696
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:02,184
I'm sorry.
I hope that you choose laugh.

697
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,227
I don't understand.

698
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,058
I don't either.

699
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,658
Look, let's just finish the dessert
and go back to your place...

700
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:13,999
and make love,
and maybe it'll come to me.

701
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,403
- While we make love?
- I said maybe.

702
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,837
But... you love me?

703
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,380
More than you know.

704
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,433
- Did you eat yet?
- I said I'd wait.

705
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:47,597
How did you know
thatJames would tell me?

706
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:51,801
Man loves his wife. He may not be strong,
but he has a conscience.

707
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:55,073
See, I... I can't tell that stuff.

708
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:57,807
And I can't tell the difference
between coral and bone.

709
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:01,477
So I guess we make a great pair.
Hey, speaking of marriage...

710
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,486
Hodgins is gonna propose
to Angela tonight.

711
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,988
- Huh.
- What?

712
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:09,856
I guess right now, it looks to me
like marriage is having someone...

713
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:13,488
who will slap your enemies and then
toss their dead bodies out of airplanes.

714
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:16,032
[Booth]
Try not to mention that to Angela.

715
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,102
What's that mean?
