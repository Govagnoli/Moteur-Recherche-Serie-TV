1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,600
<i>This is the final boarding call</i>

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,500
<i>for Flight 416 with service...</i>

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,500
I'm late.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,300
This board is broken.

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,500
<i>At this time...</i>

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,700
The arrivals board is not working.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,400
Uh, did anybody meet the flight from Guatemala?

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,800
Aviateca Airlines?

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,300
What gate?

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,200
I'm late.

11
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,600
Excuse me, uh...

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,100
you have a computer glitch at the arrivals board.

13
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,600
Hello?

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,000
Sir, excuse me, yoo-hoo.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,200
Great.

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,100
Hi. The flight from Guatemala.

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,400
Tell me you tried "excuse me" first.

18
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,700
Sweetie!

19
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,100
Yes, I did! Welcome home.

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
Oh! Are you exhausted?

21
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,000
Was Guatemala awful?

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,300
Was it horribly backward?

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,700
And yet, I was never reduced
to flashing my boobs for information.

24
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,400
Flash them for any fun reasons?

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,700
I was literally neck deep in a mass grave.

26
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,600
Not romantic.

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,700
You know, diving head first in a pit of cadavers

28
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,400
is no way to handle a messy break-up.

29
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,800
Angela, nothing Pete and I ever did was messy.

30
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,100
Then you were not doing the right thing.

31
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,800
Sir, why are you following us?

32
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,600
Attack! Security! Hello!

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,100
Who runs this airport?

34
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,900
Kick his ass.

35
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,200
- Step back now!
- He attacked me.

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,900
I'm Homeland Security!

37
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh... little misunderstanding here.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You can put away your guns.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,700
What, is she in charge now?

40
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,500
No, I'll tell you when you can lower your weapons.

41
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,900
Hand over the bag.

42
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,400
Is that what this is about?

43
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,200
I am Dr. Temperance Brennan.

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,000
I've been in Guatemala for two months,

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,800
identifying victims of genocide,
including him.

46
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,300
Most people in this situation,

47
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,100
what they do is
they sweat it.

48
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,400
Guatemala? Genocide?

49
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,300
How are you scary after that?

50
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,700
- You know who doesn't sweat it?
- Sociopaths.

51
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm not a sociopath.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,200
I'm an anthropologist at the Jeffersonian.

53
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,500
Who works for the FBI.

54
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,800
Which I'd maybe believe
if you had ID that did more than

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
allowed you access to the cafeteria.

56
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,100
You are illegally
transporting human remains, ma'am.

57
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,000
And you assaulted a Homeland Security agent.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,800
Look, I'm sorry if I embarrassed
you in front of your friends,

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,500
but next time, you should
identify yourself before attacking me.

60
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,000
What are you doing here?

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,500
FBI. Special Agent Seeley Booth,

62
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,300
Major Crime Investigation, DC.

63
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,900
Bones identifies bodies for us.

64
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,600
Don't call me Bones.

65
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,200
And I do more than identify.

66
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,700
She also writes books.

67
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,300
Fine. She's all yours.

68
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,600
Great. Let's grab your skull,
and let's vamoose.

69
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,500
What, that's it?
"She's all yours"?

70
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,600
- Why did you stop me?
- What does it matter? You're free to go.

71
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,900
Just grab your bags...

72
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,000
You set me up.

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You got a hold-for-questioning
request from the FBI, didn't you?

74
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,700
I love this book.

75
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,000
Come on.

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,600
That's the best you can do?

77
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,100
What?

78
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,700
Getting Homeland Security
to snatch me so you can stage a fake rescue?

79
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,900
Well, at least I picked you up at the airport, huh?

80
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,600
Come on, I mean, I went
through the appropriate channels,

81
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,500
but your assistant there,
he stone-walled me.

82
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,800
Yeah, well, after the last case,
I told Zack never ever to put you through.

83
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,900
He's a good assistant.
You can let me out anywhere along here.

84
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,600
All right, listen,

85
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,700
a decomposed corpse was found
this morning at Arlington National Cemetery.

86
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,700
Arlington National Cemetery
is full of decomposed corpses.

87
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,400
It's a cemetery.

88
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,800
Yeah, but this one is your type of corpse,

89
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,900
it wasn't in a casket.

90
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,900
If you drive one more block
I'm screaming "kidnap" out the window.

91
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,100
- I'm trying to mend bridges here.
- Pull over.

92
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,600
- I'm going home.
- Great.

93
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,300
Could we...

94
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,200
Look, could we just skip this part?

95
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,700
I find you very condescending.

96
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,000
Me? I'm condescending?

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm not the one who's got to mention
that she's got a doctorate every five minutes.

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,800
- I am the one with a doctorate.
- Yeah, but I'm the one with the badge and the gun.

99
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,300
You're not the only forensic anthropologist in town.

100
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,300
Yes, I am. The next nearest is in Montreal.

101
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,700
Parlez-vous Français?

102
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,900
What's it going to take, huh?

103
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,300
- Full participation in the case.
- Fine.

104
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,300
Not just lab work, everything.

105
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,800
Well you want me to spit in my hand?
We're Scully and Mulder.

106
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
I don't know what that means.

107
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,100
It's an olive branch.

108
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,000
Just get back in the car.

109
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,400
What's the context of the find?

110
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,500
Routine landscaping--

111
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,900
they drop the level of the pond,

112
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,900
one of the workmen thought he saw something.

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,600
Hi, Zack.

114
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,000
- This eco-warrior look works for you.
- Thanks.

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,800
Very action-oriented.

116
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,000
Agent Booth, you remember
my assistant, Zack Addy?

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,100
Oh, yeah.

118
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,200
How was Guatemala?

119
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,200
You dig up lots of massacred victims?

120
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
Learn a thing or two about machete strikes?

121
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,900
Zack, I need water samples
and temperature readings from the pond.

122
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,200
Right away, Dr. Brennan.

123
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,500
He's got no sense of discretion, that kid.

124
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,300
Typical squint.

125
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,500
I don't know what that means.

126
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
Well, cops get stuck, we bring in people like you.

127
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,100
You know-- squints...

128
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,600
you know, who squint at things.

129
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,900
Oh, you mean people with very high IQs
and basic reasoning skills.

130
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,800
What, exactly, am I supposed to be squinting at?

131
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,700
It's like pornography.

132
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,700
You'll know it when you see it.

133
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah, Ok...

134
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,000
This is a crime scene.

135
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,300

139
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,400
{\a6}The remains are wrapped in four-mil flat
poly construction sheeting.

140
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,300
PVC-coated chicken wire.

141
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,500
Weighted.

142
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,500
{\a6}That's why the body didn't surface
during decomposition.

143
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,800
{\a6}The skeleton is complete,
but the skull is in fragments.

144
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,600
- What can you tell me?
- Not much.

145
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,700
{\a6}She's a young woman,

146
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,400
{\a6}probably between 18 and 22,

147
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,500
{\a6}approximately five foot three,

148
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,000
{\a6}race unknown, delicate features.

149
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,200
{\a6}That's all?

150
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,000
{\a6}Tennis player.

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,200
{\a6}How do you get a
pretty tennis player out of that yuck?

152
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,700
Epiphysis fusion gives age.

153
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,300
Pelvic bone shape gives sex.

154
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,200
Bursitis in the shoulder.

155
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,200
{\a6}Somebody this young,
it must be an athletic injury.

156
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,000
When did she die?

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,600
- Eh...
- "Eh"?! What does that even mean?

158
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,100
Means wait until our bug and slime guy takes a look.

159
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,300
No clothing.

160
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,100
{\a6}You know, in my line of work,
no clothes usually means a sex crime.

161
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,600
In my line of work, it can also mean
the victim favored natural fibers.

162
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,900
Your suit, for example,
will outlast your bones by decades.

163
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,100
{\a6}Collect silt, three meters radius

164
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,200
{\a6}to a depth of ten centimeters.

165
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,800
Your FBI forensics team
can take the plastic and the chicken wire,

166
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,500
we'll take the rest.

167
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,600
{\a6}Dr. Goodman, I wish you wouldn't just give me to the FBI.

168
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,400
As a federally funded institution,

169
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,000
the Jeffersonian must seize every opportunity

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,800
to prove our worth to our friends in Congress,

171
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,200
which means I loan you out as I see fit,

172
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,300
especially to federal agencies.

173
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,200
"Loan out" implies property, Dr. Goodman.

174
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,000
The FBI will never respect mere property.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,900
I do not view you as property, Dr. Brennan.

176
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,700
You are one of the Jeffersonian's
most valuable assets.

177
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,700
An asset is, by definition, property.

178
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,100
What's the rule, Mr. Addy?

179
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,000
You only converse with PhDs.

180
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You realize I'm halfway through two doctorates?

181
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,400
Two halves make a whole, so mathematically speaking...

182
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,900
Go polish a bone, Mr. Addy.

183
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,900
Dr. Goodman,

184
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,400
FBI agents will never respect any of us

185
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,600
as long as you simply
dole out scientists like office temps.

186
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Dr. Brennan,

187
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,700
are you playing me?

188
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,100
You know I'm no good at that.

189
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,800
Mmm. Thus far.

190
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,800
But you have a disturbingly steep learning curve.

191
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,500
The pond is not only warm and teeming with microbes,

192
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,300
which accelerated decomposition,

193
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,300
but it houses black carp and koi,
which fed on the body.

194
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,300
Can I, as the only normal person in this room,

195
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,500
say, "Ew"?

196
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,300
I got three larval stages of Tricoptera, Chironimidae...

197
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,400
As we cut to the chase...

198
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,500
The body was in the pond one winter and two summers.

199
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,600
Spring before last?

200
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,000
Do you really think I'm lusty?

201
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,600
The book.

202
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,500
No, no, no, you're not in the book.

203
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,900
Sure he is, we all are.

204
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,100
No, none of you are in the book.

205
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,700
- Those are fictitious characters based on...
- I found some small bone fragments in the silt.

206
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,600
We're out of the book now.

207
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,200
- We're back in real life.
- I'd guess Rana temporaria.

208
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,000
Frog bones?

209
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Also, some tiny gold links, as from a fine chain.

210
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,800
Point of clarification--

211
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,200
I'm not a virgin.

212
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,700
Nowhere near, in fact.

213
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,300
Who you captured perfectly is Booth.

214
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,900
Buttoned down, but...

215
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,300
buckets of sexual confidence which...

216
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,600
oh, I, for one, would love to tap.

217
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,400
It's not right to discuss tapping asses
in front of the soaker.

218
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,300
I can't bounce back and forth
between my book and real life.

219
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,300
Since we're stuck with real life,
let's just forget the book.

220
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,600
I haven't analyzed whatever it was
the victim was holding in her hand,

221
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,300
but it looks like cellulose.

222
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,200
Paper?

223
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,500
Hmm. Possibly.

224
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,100
I found microscopic grit
embedded in the skull fragments.

225
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,900
I need you to identify those, too.

226
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,200
Remove the remaining tissue,

227
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
I'll debride the skull fragments myself,

228
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,000
reassemble it so Angela
can put a face on our victim.

229
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,100
Good. I prefer holographs.

230
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,600
They don't stink.

231
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,600
Zack...

232
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I don't like those terms for human remains--

233
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,900
"soaker," "crispy critter..."

234
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,100
I know, Dr. Brennan.

235
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,900
{\i1 \c&H30D3F4&}The dawn is breaking 

236
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
{\i1 \c&H30D3F4&}A light shining through

237
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,100
{\i1 \c&H30D3F4&}You're barely waking 

238
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
{\i1 \c&H30D3F4&}And I'm tangled up in you

239
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,800
{\i1 \c&H30D3F4&}Yeah... 

240
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,400
{\i1 \c&H30D3F4&}But I'm hoping your close

241
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,600
{\i1 \c&H30D3F4&}Well, I follow your car 

242
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,200
{\i1 \c&H30D3F4&}I worry I won't see your face 

243
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
{\i1 \c&H30D3F4&}Light up again 

244
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,800
{\i1 \c&H30D3F4&}Even the best fall down sometimes 

245
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,800
{\i1 \c&H30D3F4&}Even the wrong words seem to rhyme 

246
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
{\i1 \c&H30D3F4&}Out of the doubt that fills my mind 

247
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,900
{\i1 \c&H30D3F4&}I somehow find

248
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,500
{\i1 \c&H30D3F4&}you and I collide 

249
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,100
{\i1 \c&H30D3F4&}Collide 

250
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,200
{\a6}So, you guaranteed a squint
a field role in an active murder investigation?

251
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,800
{\a6}Yes, sir.

252
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,700
{\a6}- The one that wrote the book?
- Yes, sir.

253
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,300
Thought you said
she wouldn't work with you anymore.

254
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,400
The last case we worked,

255
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,800
she provided a description
of the murder weapon and the murderer,

256
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,300
but I didn't give her much credence.

257
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,100
Why not?

258
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Because she did it by looking at
the victim's autopsy X rays.

259
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,100
Well, I wouldn't give it much credence, either.

260
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,300
Turns out she was right on both.

261
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,700
Plus, the pond victim--

262
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,000
Brennan gives me the victim's age,
sex and favorite sport.

263
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,300
- Which is?
- Tennis.

264
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,000
- She's good.
- No, she's amazing.

265
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,700
Only way I can get her back on my side

266
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,200
is to bring her out in the field...

267
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
I'm willing.

268
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,500
Fine. She's on you.

269
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,900
Take a squint out in the field,
she's your responsibility.

270
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,900
Yes, sir.

271
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,700
Peter?

272
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,300
It's not rational for you
to choose the first day I'm back

273
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,300
to reclaim your television.

274
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,600
While you were away,
I thought a lot about why we broke up.

275
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,900
We fought all the time
and don't like each other anymore.

276
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,900
We fought because
you were emotionally distant and cold.

277
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,900
But sexually speaking,
I think you'll agree...

278
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,900
You didn't come for your TV.
You timed this for a booty call.

279
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,100
Okay, you're leaving.

280
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,200
Your intimacy issues
are probably due to being orphaned so young.

281
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,700
I hate psychology, and you're just horny.

282
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,100
Brennan, do you really want to spend
the rest of your life alone?

283
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,200
I don't know about the rest of my life,

284
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,200
but I sure as hell wish I was alone right now.

285
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,500
So, what? We split the cost of the TV?

286
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,300
Good-bye.

287
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,400
What?

288
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
{\a6}This is interesting, Angela.

289
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,900
{\a6}Good morning.

290
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,200
Does Booth know how this works?

291
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,900
This computer program, which I designed--

292
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,400
patent pending--

293
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,300
accepts a full array of digital input,

294
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,200
processes it and then projects it

295
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,000
as a three-dimensional holographic image.

296
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,500
Okay.

297
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,000
- You get that?
- Yeah, the patent pending part.

298
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,900
Brennan reassembled the skull
and applied tissue markers.

299
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,500
Her skull was badly damaged,
but racial indicators--

300
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,700
cheekbone dimensions, nasal arch,
occipital measurements--

301
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,800
suggest African-American.

302
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
And...

303
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,300
we have our victim.

304
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,400
I have to admit, that's pretty cool.

305
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,000
Ange, rerun the program
substituting Caucasian values.

306
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Does she look familiar to anyone?

307
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,000
Split the difference. Mixed race.

308
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,300
Lenny Kravitz or Vanessa Williams?

309
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,800
I don't know what that means.

310
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,600
Angela, reduce tissue depth
over the cheekbones to the jawline.

311
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,400
Does anyone recognize her?

312
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,600
- Not me.
- Wait.

313
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,300
Is that who I think it is?

314
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,500
The girl who had the affair with the Senator?

315
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,800
Her name's Cleo Louise Eller...

316
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,300
only daughter to Ted and Sharon Eller.

317
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,300
Last seen approximately 9:00 p.m.,

318
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,000
April 6 2003, leaving the Cardio Deluxe Jam on K Street.

319
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
She didn't even make it to her car.

320
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,700
Pretty good memory.

321
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,300
Yeah, well, it's my job to find her.

322
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,100
In that case, congratulations on your success.

323
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,100
This isn't exactly the way I wanted it to end.

324
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,500
Cleo Eller is not just some missing girl.

325
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,300
Yeah, she's a senate intern
who was boinking Senator Allan Bethlehem.

326
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,200
I was secondary in the investigation
into the disappearance of that girl,

327
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,700
and we couldn't confirm that.

328
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,800
How did you recognize her
before she even had her own face?

329
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,000
I recognized the underlying
architecture of her features,

330
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,100
the rest is just window dressing.

331
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,100
I'm not an expert, but shouldn't he be happier?

332
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,300
- Oh, no, believe me, I'm happy.
- You seem happy to me.

333
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,500
I need this kept quiet.

334
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,700
Ah, cover-up.

335
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,600
Paranoid conspiracy theory.

336
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,300
Is it paranoia that Monica Lewinsky
was a KGB-trained sex-agent mole?

337
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,000
So what do you do first, confront the Senator?

338
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,100
- Listen, Bones. I know...
- Don't call me Bones.

339
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,100
I know we talked about you
coming out in the field and all...

340
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,900
- Oh, you rat bastard!
- But if it's this big,

341
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,100
the Director's gonna create
a special investigation unit.

342
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,900
And if line all my ducks up in a row,
I can maybe head it up.

343
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,600
I don't know what that means,
but I think I can be a duck.

344
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,400
You're not a duck. Okay?
On this one, we stick to the book.

345
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,900
Cops on the streets, squints in the lab.

346
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,500
In that case, the Jeffersonian
will be issuing a press release

347
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,000
identifying the girl in the pond.

348
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,000
You do that, I'm a dead duck.

349
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,400
What are you trying to do?

350
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,800
Blackmail you.

351
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,300
Blackmail a federal agent?

352
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,100
- I don't like it.
- I'm fairly certain you're not supposed to.

353
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,100
Fine, you're in.

354
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,600
You're certain it's Cleo Eller?

355
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,000
The profile's dead on : age, race, height.

356
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,100
Plus, the timeline fits.

357
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,300
I mean, Cleo Eller did play tennis in college.

358
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,100
Talk to me about the Senator.

359
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,100
Cleo Eller, the victim, worked for Senator Bethlehem.

360
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,100
- It was reported that they were involved sexually.
- We couldn't confirm that.

361
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,400
Well, Bethlehem's a hound. Everybody knows that.

362
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,400
Ken Thompson, Cleo's boyfriend.

363
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,300
Thompson's still Bethlehem's aide.

364
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,400
Thompson keeps Bethlehem's calendar.

365
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,900
No way the Senator has an affair
that Thompson doesn't know about.

366
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,100
No sexual relationship, no motive.

367
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,800
What about the nut case?

368
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,000
Oliver Laurier.

369
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,200
Do you like him for this?

370
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,500
He's a stalker.

371
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,800
What's your first move?

372
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,700
I'd like to inform the Ellers that
we found their daughter.

373
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,100
It's better to keep this quiet.

374
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,900
It's been, what, two years?

375
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,300
What's another few days?

376
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,600
All due respect, sir,
I've come to know the family pretty well,

377
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,800
especially the Major,
and two years is a hell of a long time in limbo.

378
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,700
I'll have details of cause
of death by this afternoon.

379
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,400
That's where we'll get started.

380
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
All right.

381
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,400
Hodgins identified the particulates embedded
in Cleo Eller's skull as rolled steel--

382
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,200
most likely from a sledge-type hammer.

383
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Also, there's cement and diatomaceous earth.

384
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,800
- What's that?
- Looks like that.

385
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,900
It's made up of prehistoric sea creatures.

386
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,300
It's used as an insecticide,
filtering agent,

387
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,300
cleaning abrasive, ceramics.

388
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,200
It's very common.

389
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Diatomaceous earth
common or not, it's a clue.

390
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,000
You're positive it's our Cleo?

391
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,700
We established 22 matching points of comparison...

392
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,400
We're certain.

393
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,200
Did he do it?

394
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,300
The Senator?

395
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,600
One military man to another?

396
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,300
Major Eller, we can't discuss the investigation in any way.

397
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,800
Can you at least tell us if our daughter suffered?

398
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,200
Given the state of her skull...

399
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Cleo never saw it coming.

400
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,500
Thank you.

401
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,300
Mrs. Eller, could you tell us what Cleo wore around her neck?

402
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,300
Her father's Bronze Star.

403
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,300
Ted won it in the first Gulf War,

404
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
and he gave it to her for luck.

405
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,000
Those people deserve the truth.

406
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Their daughter was murdered.
They deserve the kindness of a lie.

407
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,300
There will bean inquest report.

408
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,300
Which they won't read because they don't want to.

409
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,800
Especially because toward the end,

410
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Cleo and her parents weren't even speaking.

411
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
They told you that?

412
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Getting information out of live people
is a lot different than

413
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,000
getting information out of a pile of bones.

414
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,700
You have to offer up something of yourself first.

415
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,600
What exactly did you do in the military?

416
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,800
See?

417
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,000
See what you did right there, Bones?

418
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,100
You asked a personal question without offering
anything personal in return.

419
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,100
And since I'm not a skeleton,
you get zilch. Sorry.

420
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,500
There are stab marks here.

421
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,300
And odd markings on the distal phalanges.

422
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,700
Nothing I've seen before.

423
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,900
In a nutshell?
Anxious, depressed and nauseous.

424
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,400
- Take a sick day.
- Not me. Cleo Eller.

425
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,300
People casings show she was on Lorazepam,

426
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,000
Chlordiazepoxide and Meclizine Hydrochloride.

427
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,700
Nausea...

428
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,700
Show me those bone fragments.

429
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,100
These aren't frog bones.

430
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,400
Cleo Eller was pregnant.

431
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,800
- Fetal remains?
- Malleus, incus, stapes.

432
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,900
These are fetal ear bones.

433
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,900
- The girl was pregnant.
- Not very far along.

434
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,200
You want me to try and get a DNA reading,
see if we can prove paternity?

435
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,900
You can try. Let's hope there's enough
genetic material to test.

436
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,200
This Senator, oh, he is smart.

437
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,400
He gets an intern pregnant,

438
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,600
then murders her when it threatens his career.

439
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,100
And he has the connections to get away with it.

440
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,400
I hate it when you make paranoia plausible.
It's like sliding off a cliff.

441
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,400
This special unit,
no way your FBI pal heads it up,

442
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:31,000
unless the dark powers in charge are convinced
he knows where his political bread is buttered.

443
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,200
Either way, that's where this investigation ends.

444
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,500
{\i1 \c&H30D3F4&}Stay for life

445
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,100
{\i1 \c&H30D3F4&}For life... 

446
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,700
Want to get a drink?

447
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,300
Non-topical application?

448
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,700
Glug-glug, whoo-hoo!

449
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Come on, sweetie.

450
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,500
What if Booth's right?

451
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,100
What if I'm only good with bones
and lousy with people?

452
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,200
- People like you.
- I don't care if men like me.

453
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Okay, interesting leap from "people" to "men,"

454
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,100
- but I'm sure it means nothing.
- I hate psychology.

455
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,400
My most meaningful relationships
are with dead people.

456
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,600
- Who said that?
- It's true.

457
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,600
I understand Cleo,
and her bones are all I've ever seen.

458
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,300
When she was seven,
she broke her wrist, probably falling off a bike,

459
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,900
and two weeks later,
before the cast was even removed,

460
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,900
she got right back on that bike
and broke it all over again.

461
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And when she was being murdered,
she fought back hard even though...

462
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
...she was so depressed she could hardly
get up in the morning.

463
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,400
She didn't welcome death.

464
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,800
Cleo wanted to live.

465
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,600
Honey...

466
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,200
you ever think that maybe you come off
a little distant because you connect too much?

467
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,800
I hate psychology.
It's a soft science.

468
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,300
I know, but...

469
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,200
people are mostly soft.

470
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,700
Except for their bones.

471
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,100
You want some advice?

472
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,600
Glug-glug, whoo-hoo?

473
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,800
Offer up a little bit of yourself every once in a while.

474
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,200
Just...

475
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,400
tell somebody something you're not
completely certain you want them to know.

476
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,100
That's the second time I've received that advice.

477
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,100
Well, you know I give great advice.

478
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm going to have to push this to the next level.

479
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,100
I'm a little confused as to why
the Director of the FBI would send you

480
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,400
to speak to the Senator instead of coming himself.

481
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,400
Probably because I'm the one that found
that Cleo Eller was pregnant.

482
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You could tell the girl
was pregnant from her skeleton?

483
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,900
We found fetal bones.

484
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,900
The only question, Senator,
is which one of you is the father.

485
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Are you willing to submit to a DNA test?

486
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,600
You know what? Given the sensitivity,
don't say anything on the subject

487
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,300
without your attorney present,
that's my advice.

488
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,000
Advice I intend to take.

489
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Ken, we have a vote to get to.

490
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,100
What are you doing?

491
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,000
Saliva, say from chewing gum,
is an excellent source of DNA.

492
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,100
I intend to compare it to the DNA in the fetal bones.

493
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,800
You need a warrant for that.

494
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Ken. She needs a warrant.

495
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,100
We have any further questions,
we'll be in touch.

496
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,300
Ken. You okay?

497
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,300
I could place you under arrest
on a federal charge right now

498
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,600
for uttering threats against
a United States senator.

499
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,900
- What?
- Bones.

500
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,200
- I own her, but she was your responsibility.
- Yes, sir.

501
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,900
Send in Special Agent Furst.

502
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,300
I warned you about taking
squints out to the field,

503
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,400
but you vouched for her,
said she wouldn't screw up.

504
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,800
- Yes, sir.
- No, no.

505
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,400
Booth didn't know that I was going to see the Senator.

506
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
I wanted to get a sample of his DNA.

507
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,100
- Exactly.
- Not helping.

508
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,000
Tomorrow morning I'm announcing
the formation of a special unit

509
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,400
to investigate the murder of Cleo Eller,

510
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,700
at which time your investigation
will be officially terminated.

511
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,400
You will not head the new unit.

512
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,100
Congratulations, Patrick.

513
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,900
- No hard feelings.
- Right.

514
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,800
I need the complete case files in the morning.

515
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,700
Of course. They'll be ready.

516
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,100
Thank you, Agent Furst.

517
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,500
Well, at least Dr. Brennan found out
that Senator Bethlehem was having sex with Cleo.

518
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,200
I did?

519
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,900
The report said there wasn't enough
DNA in the fetal bones to determine paternity.

520
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,900
Senator Bethlehem didn't want
Dr. Brennan to take that gum.

521
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,900
He's hiding something.

522
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,900
He didn't know there wasn't enough DNA.

523
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:02,800
I suggest that you, uh, go back to your lab,
Dr. Brennan, and get used to being there.

524
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,700
Come on, Bones.

525
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,600
Don't be nice to me
after I got you in trouble.

526
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,800
Your heart was in the right place.

527
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,400
I'm not a heart person.
You're a heart person.

528
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,700
I'm a brain person.

529
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,200
- You vouched for me.
- Forget it.

530
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,500
No, I won't.

531
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,500
You think it was the Senator?

532
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,800
The Senator's had sex
with a dozen of these interns

533
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,300
and he hasn't killed any of them.
My best bet is still the stalker.

534
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,300
You want to check him out?

535
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,700
We can, um,
what do you call it, roost him?

536
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,700
Roust...

537
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,300
The murderer snatched the Bronze Star
from Cleo's neck, so...

538
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,700
I got 12 hours before this case is over
and I'm off it, so let's go roust him. Come on.

539
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,500
Mr. Laurier, we have a warrant to search your apartm...

540
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,500
Don't run, Oliver.

541
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,100
Agent Booth is under the impression

542
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,100
that you might have something pertinent
to a case he's working on.

543
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,300
You're looking for a Bronze Star?

544
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,500
Like the one Cleo wore?

545
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,300
Exactly like that one, Mr. Laurier.

546
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,500
I don't have it.

547
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,500
Sometimes stalkers retain keepsakes.

548
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,900
What the hell are these things, huh?

549
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,200
Miniature Lives of the Saints.

550
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
- I hand them out...
- Heads up, Bones.

551
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,200
I hand them out for donations.

552
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,100
I'm not a panhandler. Help yourself.

553
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,100
I never stalked Cleo.

554
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,800
Then why'd she get a restraining order?

555
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,400
First of all, no.

556
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,600
Ken Thompson, her supposed boyfriend,
got the restraining order,

557
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,000
with his boss, the Senator,

558
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,500
but Ken is only concerned
with his job and his tropical fish.

559
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,700
They colluded to ruin my reputation

560
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,600
with this specious "stalker" label,
when, in actuality...

561
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,500
...I was Cleo's close friend.

562
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,100
Then why'd you run from the warrant?

563
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,300
My fight-or-flight response
is heavily weighted towards flight.

564
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,300
If there's anything I can do...

565
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,800
to help you catch Cleo's killer, just tell me.

566
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,800
Oh, a full confession, that would be great.

567
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,000
I love Cleo.

568
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,100
Why would I hurt her?

569
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,600
If you don't mind,
I'm gonna keep one of these little books.

570
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,100
Whatever you need...

571
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,600
Dr. Brennan.

572
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
This is a rough composite,
but you get the idea.

573
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,300
Skull trauma was not the cause of death.

574
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,800
Cleo was stabbed first.

575
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,800
She was stabbed five to eight times
with a military issue K-Bar knife.

576
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,300
I just completed this rendering.

577
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,100
The defensive wounds to the bones of her hands

578
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,900
suggest that it wasn't until
the third or the fourth penetration...

579
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,900
That's likely the fatal stab, right there.

580
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,100
...that Cleo stopped fighting back.

581
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,600
I believe that the distinctive damage

582
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,700
to her distal phalanges
-- the tips of her finger bones--

583
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,200
was caused by the murderer using the knife
to remove herfinger pads.

584
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,100
Cranial fragmentation suggests a 20-pound hammer

585
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,400
striking four to five times while
the victim's head rested on a cement floor

586
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,100
containing traces of diatomaceous earth.

587
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,600
That's the best explanation for
the particulates found in her skull.

588
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,700
This was not a crime of passion.

589
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,700
Cleo never saw the first stab coming.

590
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,500
It didn't arise out of an argument.

591
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,400
Why smash Cleo's face?

592
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,100
Why whittle away her fingertips,
remove her clothing and her jewelry?

593
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,200
Sink her body...

594
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,100
The murderer put more effort
into hiding the victim's identity

595
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,700
than he did into the murder itself.

596
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,700
In case Cleo was identified,
the murderer planted evidence.

597
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,600
The little book Brennan got from the stalker
matches the cellulose found in Cleo's hand.

598
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,500
Military cemetery, military knife,
implicates her own father, more misdirection.

599
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,700
Sound like any conniving
son-of-a-bitch senators you know?

600
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,500
You expect me to declare war
on a United States senator

601
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,500
based on your little holographic crystal ball?

602
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,000
It's not magic.

603
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,800
It's a logical recreation of events
based on evidence.

604
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,900
- It's no more valid than my gut.
- A good hypothesis with stands testing.

605
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,200
That's what makes it a good hypothesis.

606
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,500
Not a hypothesis

607
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,200
You have a dead girl
and a United States senator.

608
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,200
This is exactly why squints belong in the lab.

609
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,300
You guys don't know anything
about the real world.

610
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,400
Come on. We're done here.

611
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,300
Touchy!

612
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,700
You must know about her family.

613
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,700
Both parents vanish when she's 15.

614
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,800
Probably counts as the real world.

615
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,800
Yeah, I know the story.

616
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,000
I read the file.

617
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
The cops never found out anything.

618
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,000
Brennan figures that...

619
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
maybe if somebody like her
had been there...

620
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,900
Well, for somebody who hates psychology,

621
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,800
she sure has a lot of it.

622
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,400
Thought I'd find you here.

623
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,900
You know, you being a good shot
and doing martial arts,

624
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,400
it's all your way of dealing.

625
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,400
I mean, who knows better than you
how fragile life can be?

626
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,200
Maybe an Army Ranger sniper who became
an FBI homicide investigator.

627
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
Oh, you looked me up, huh?

628
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Do you mind?

629
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,500
- Be my guest.
- Thank you.

630
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,000
Were you any good at being a sniper?

631
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,100
A sniper gets to know
a little something about killers.

632
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,800
Senator Bethlehem, he's no killer.

633
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,300
Oh, and Oliver Laurier is?

634
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,800
Way I read Laurier, he's unhinged.

635
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,500
That makes him dangerous.

636
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,600
That'd be your "gut" telling you that, correct?

637
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,100
You know, homicides?

638
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,400
They're not solved by scientists.

639
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,000
They're solved by guys like me
asking a thousand questions a thousand times,

640
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
catching people telling lies every time.

641
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,400
You're great at what you do, Bones, but...

642
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
you don't solve murders...

643
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,800
Cops do.

644
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,600
Cleo Eller was killed on a cement floor
sprinkled with diatomaceous earth.

645
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,600
Traces of her blood will still be in that cement.

646
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,600
One of us is wrong, maybe both of us,

647
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,600
but if Bethlehem wasn't a senator,

648
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,600
you'd be right there in his basement
looking for that killing floor.

649
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,400
You're afraid of him.

650
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,200
Your hypothesis is that squints
don't solve murders and cops do.

651
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,300
Prove it.

652
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
Be a cop.

653
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
Booth?

654
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,000
They look pretty happy, don't they?

655
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,100
Otherwise they wouldn't
turn on the camera, I guess.

656
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,600
Zack said you wanted to see me.

657
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,100
Something you don't like
to talk about :

658
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,100
families.

659
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
Temperance...

660
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,100
partners, they share things.

661
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,300
Builds trust.

662
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,300
Since when are we partners?

663
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,900
I apologize for the assumption.

664
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,500
You got a warrant to search Bethlehem's place?

665
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,100
You were right :

666
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,200
If Bethlehem wasn't a senator,

667
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,000
I'd be in that basement,
looking for that killing floor.

668
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,500
But you're wrong.

669
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,200
I was never afraid of that guy.

670
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And I'm not doing this
because you're a genius.

671
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,300
I'm doing this for Cleo.

672
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,500
Sir, it's John Ferris.
Channel 11. Sir!

673
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Here, sir!

674
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,800
The warrant says they're searching
for blood traces,

675
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,600
a sledgehammer and diatomaceous earth.

676
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,100
What the hell is that?

677
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,900
You're making a big mistake.

678
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,600
I'm only in charge...

679
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,600
You're coming in and mess up my investigation.

680
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,100
Care to make a statement, Senator?

681
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,700
Senator Bethlehem,
can you just answer a couple questions?

682
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,500
Yeah, go ahead.

683
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
Who gave you this warrant?
When was it delivered?

684
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,600
What are you doing here?

685
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,100
Look at him.
For all his politics, he's got nothing.

686
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,600
He should've loved Cleo properly,
like I would've.

687
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,800
Will you sign my book?

688
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,900
Stalk me, Oliver, and I will kick your ass.

689
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,200
I don't recognize that.

690
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,200
That is not mine.

691
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,700
That is not mine!

692
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,700
- At least we got the hammer.
- Yeah, but that's all we got.

693
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,100
Cement floor in the basement?

694
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,100
Yeah, but no blood, no diatomaceous earth.

695
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,500
We needed a trifecta, Bones,

696
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,500
physical evidence, murder weapon,
crime scene.

697
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,700
They wouldn't even arrest him?

698
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,700
Don't worry.

699
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,700
If that's the hammer used on Cleo Eller,
he'll get arrested.

700
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,000
A toast...

701
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,500
to getting the murderous bastard.

702
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,000
The hammer's not enough.

703
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,800
He's going to get away with it.

704
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,800
Maybe Booth is right.
Maybe outside the lab, I'm useless.

705
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,600
Let us take guidance from The Lives of the Saints.

706
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,300
<i>Albertus Magnus, Patron Saint of Scientists.</i>

707
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,900
I thought Magnus was the patron saint of fishmongers.

708
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,400
Two separate entities.

709
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,600
Albertus Magnus
was a 13th-century philosopher.

710
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,700
The fishmonger saint was...

711
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,700
Fish!

712
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,200
You said that diatomaceous earth
could be used as a filtering agent.

713
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,300
Yeah, for swimming pools, water filters...

714
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,900
Or tropical fish?

715
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,200
Oliver Laurier said that
Ken Thompson kept fish.

716
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,100
What's your hurry?

717
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,100
Thompson read the warrant! He knows
we're looking for diatomaceous earth!

718
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,400
Get in touch with Booth.

719
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Tell him where I'm going, okay?

720
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,400
She didn't actually say
where she was going, did she?

721
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,400
Stop!
You can't destroy evidence.

722
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,600
This is a private residence.
I don't suppose you have a warrant?

723
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,900
I'm working with the FBI.

724
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,100
If I have reasonable suspicion
of a crime being committed,

725
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,300
I don't need a warrant.

726
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,400
What crime?

727
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,400
Destruction of evidence
pertinent to a federal investigation.

728
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,400
I'm just cleaning up.

729
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,300
Is that alcoholy smell on your breath?

730
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
This linoleum looks fairly new.

731
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,000
What's underneath? Cement?

732
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,500
The same cement that was embedded in Cleo's skull
when you bashed her head in?

733
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,300
You might wanna get out of here.

734
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,800
I can't let you destroy evidence.

735
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,000
How are you going to stop me?

736
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,900
I'll stop you.

737
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,200
Not before I burn this place down

738
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,700
with you in it.

739
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,800
I don't get it.

740
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,700
It wasn't jealousy,
it wasn't passion.

741
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,700
Cleo wouldn't get rid of your boss's baby,

742
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,800
and so you got rid of her.

743
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,200
What kind of psychology is that?
What kind of person are you?

744
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,200
Temperance...

745
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,100
Are you all right?

746
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,300
Oliver, I understand you're here
out of a misguided concern for my safety,

747
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,200
but I apparently don't read people very well,

748
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,600
and you could be in some kind of
psychotic collusion with Ken,

749
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,800
so I'm going to ask you to go over there

750
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,200
and apply pressure to his wound
until the police get here, you understand?

751
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,900
- Did he kill Cleo?
- Yeah. He killed Cleo.

752
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,900
Okay... then...

753
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,400
I'm down with him bleeding to death.

754
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,000
That guy bleeds to death, Bones
will go on trial for attempted murder.

755
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,500
You don't want that, now,do you?

756
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,600
I wouldn't want that.

757
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,900
No. Besides, you know applying pressure
that can be very painful.

758
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,400
The evidence said he did it, but...

759
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,100
I don't know why.

760
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,100
No, it doesn't matter.

761
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,400
You know what?
Motive does not matter.

762
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,900
He did it to save his job.

763
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,700
His job?

764
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,400
Yeah, senator in scandal,
he'll lose the beltway fast track.

765
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,300
It's that simple, it's...

766
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,800
It's a tough town.

767
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,400
Yeah, it is a tough town.

768
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,100
Yeah, you know in the future,

769
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,300
maybe I should do the shooting.

770
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Why? I'm a good shot.

771
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,100
Lord, make me an instrument of Your peace.

772
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,300
Where there is hatred, let me sow love.

773
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,200
Where there is injury, pardon.

774
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,100
Is the FBI gonna lay charges against Brennan?

775
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,100
She only shot him in the leg... once.

776
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,400
She didn't give him a warning.

777
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,800
She just shot him,
with alcohol on her breath.

778
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,600
It was her first shooting.

779
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,400
You can't expect her
to be perfect right out of the gate.

780
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,400
How much warning did you
give people before you sniped them?

781
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,700
{\i1 \c&H30D3F4&}...that I know what I'm all about

782
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,600
Where there's doubt, faith.

783
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,600
Where there's despair, hope.

784
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,200
Where there's darkness, light.

785
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,900
What?

786
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,000
I told you it wasn't the Senator.

787
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,900
And I told you who it was, so we're even.

788
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,700
Except we work on the same cases,
and you end up on the New York Times bestsellers list.

789
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,700
I didn't know that.

790
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,500
Number three, with a bullet.

791
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,500
That's good, right?
The New York Times, with a bullet?

792
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,900
- Means you're rich, call your accountant.
- I don't have an accountant.

793
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,700
- Well, get one.
- Okay. How does that work?

794
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,600
You need to get out of the lab, you know?

795
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,300
Watch TV, turn on a radio, anything.

796
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,300
Pick up the phone, and...

797
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,200
Where there is sadness, joy.

798
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,300
Oh, Divine Master, grant that
I may seek not so much to be consoled,

799
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,400
as to console...

800
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,400
to be understood, as to understand...

801
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,900
to be loved, as to love.

802
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,700
For it is in giving...

803
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,600
You know, if it weren't for you...

804
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,900
those people would never have known
what happened to their daughter.

805
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,400
That's got to be worse than the truth.

806
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,300
I know exactly how the Ellers felt about Cleo.

807
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,500
My parents disappeared when I was 15,
and nobody knows what happened to them.

808
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,900
Being a sniper, I...

809
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,700
took a lot of lives.

810
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,700
What I'd like to do before I'm done

811
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
is try and catch at least that many murderers.

812
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,600
Please, you don't think there's some kind of...

813
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,300
cosmic balance sheet.

814
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,500
I'd like to help you with that.

820
