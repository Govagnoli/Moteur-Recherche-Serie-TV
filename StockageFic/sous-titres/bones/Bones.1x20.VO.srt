   Sync:YTET-Vicky8800    -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,380
Uh,agent booth?

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,670
Yes,angela?

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,510
This is the pediatric cancer floor of a hospital.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,150
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,600
Right.Well,what I'm about to show deputy director cullen is kind of gruesome.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,240
Why are we meeting cullen here?

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,290
Because he's the deputy director of the fbi,

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,860
and this is where he wants us to show it to him.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay,listen,about a month ago his daughter amy was diagnosed with cancer--

11
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,470
meso...

12
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,530
mesothelioma--lung cancer.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,260
Exactly.She's not doing so well.

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,690
So it's a lot easier for us to come to him right now.

15
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,590
Hmm.What?

16
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,530
Nothing. It's just that's an extremely rare form of lung cancer.

17
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,380
Odd for someone amy's age to contract...

18
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,400
no,no,no.No probing,okay?

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,280
Not to cullen,not to his family.This'll take five minutes.We go in there,

20
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:00,110
we do the show-and-tell relating to the case,and then we're out.Is that clear?

21
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,090
I just think it's peculiar...

22
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,240
no.But I...

23
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,650
no.You have to admit...

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,800
booth.Dr. Brennan.

25
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,910
How appropriate--you two bickering in an adolescent wing.

26
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,060
Uh,sir,yes.

27
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,700
Um,is it okay if we come in,sir?

28
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,470
What do you think,sweetheart?

29
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,650
Booth's cool,most of the time.

30
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,010
You heard the lady.You're cool.

31
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,450
Yeah,right.

32
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,030
Are you sure it's all right for me to do this here?

33
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,740
Nothing I haven't seen before.

34
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,270
Let's see what you got here,angela.

35
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,450
Note the estimated time of death is mid-june.

36
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:52,750
Extreme humidity combined with insects and precipitation accelerated the rate of decomp.

37
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:58,500
So,based on this,the victim's body was not mutilated after death?

38
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,370
The effects were totally environmental.

39
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,390
Murder doesn't fit the suspect's profile,sir.

40
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,950
It's not nice to fool mother nature.

41
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,320
I'd like to see this again.

42
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,760
Knock yourself out,sir.86 times is our limit.

43
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,730
Can I see your drawings?

44
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,310
These are beautiful.

45
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,100
Our artist in the making.

46
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,460
Right now I'm doing landscapes.

47
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,820
I'm really into this french dude,rousseau.

48
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,900
Yeah. There's a lot of rousseau in paris.

49
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,990
Have you ever been to the louvre?

50
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,650
No,not yet.But it's on my list.

51
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,200
Right after "fall in love" and "learn to drive."

52
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,310
Well,you've got a great eye.

53
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,840
Thanks.

54
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,790
I think what you do is pretty awesome,too.

55
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,990
I mean,computers are not for me,but I get it.

56
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,090
Can I see what you're working on?

57
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,610
She's amazing.

58
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,780
Amy's been very brave this week.

59
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,050
They're trying an experimental viro-chemo therapy.

60
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,290
And we're very optimistic.

61
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:07,770
Since asbestos exposure is the primary way people contract mesothelioma,

62
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,860
how do you think amy...

63
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,520
How  you think amy got it?

64
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,930
We don't know,dr. Brennan.

65
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,380
First place we looked after 

66
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,080
she was diagnosed was all her previous schools,the house we lived in.Nothing.

67
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,100
Has there been a history of illness?

68
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:27,630
Hardly.Apart from breaking her leg snowboarding a year ago,

69
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,870
I can't remember the last time she was sick.

70
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,010
How bad was the break?

71
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,040
Compound fracture,left tibia.

72
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,420
I was boarding with some friends,and I hit a tree.Pretty dumb,huh?

73
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,590
And that required surgery?

74
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,640
A bone graft.

75
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:45,380
You know,I hate to drag these lovely squints back to the lab,but we have another case.

76
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,830
No we don'T.--Oh,yes we do.

77
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,360
Could I see amy's graft x-rays?

78
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,600
Sir,I apologize...--of course.

79
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,680
If you think they'll tell us anything.

80
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,690
What?

81
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,860
Pardon the fromage reference,but what's with the moldy gruyere in that leg?

82
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,560
The lighter color is evidence of demineralization.

83
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,720
I'm not the bone expert here,but yuck.

84
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,820
Osteoporosis.

85
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,930
Basically.

86
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,680
The bone has become porous,something that happens with age.

87
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,670
Zack,see if you can isolate the grafted portion and enlarge it.

88
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:21,520
Amy cullen's file states the donor of the bone was 25 years old.

89
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,860
I don't buy it.

90
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,150
What about the aging disease?

91
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,840
I've seen progerian skeletons;this isn't one of them.

92
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,700
This bone is significantly less dense than a person in their 20'S.That's for sure.

93
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,300
How old do you think the donor really was?

94
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:39,020
Judging from the reduction in bone mass...at least 60.

95
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,890
Doctor,you performed amy cullen's graft,correct?

96
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,430
Yes,but I just do the procedure,ms. Brennan.

97
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,030
Dr. Brennan.--Md?

98
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,720
Phd.

99
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,110
Well,those who can't do,do research.

100
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,490
Okay...--booth.

101
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,580
Okay,fine.

102
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,920
If you're just the mechanic,then who's responsible for all the parts that you install?

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,510
You'll have to check with the hospital's transplant coordinator.

104
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,730
Why? What's going on?

105
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,670
There are indications the bone graft you implanted in amy cullen gave her cancer.

106
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,080
That's impossible.Every graft we get has been tested and irradiated.

107
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,570
There's one way to know for sure.Assuming significant remodeling hasn't occurred,

108
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,020
do a transiliac crest core biopsy on the donor bone.Then we'll have age and pathology.

109
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,790
And who's going to perform that biopsy,doctor?

110
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,260
You are.

111
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,510
Looks like it hurts.

112
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,950
They use local anesthetic and make a small incision before inserting the needle into the bone.

113
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,040
A tiny core of bone is taken,a little more than a sixth of an inch in diameter,

114
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,120
using a ratchet-like device in the needle.

115
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,500
So,it hurts?

116
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,000
Amy's a tough kid.

117
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,210
She's doing great.

118
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,380
It's not amy I'm worried about.

119
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,650
Let's go talk to the coordinator who bought the graft.

120
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,730
Unlike amy,he gets to go home tonight.

121
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,890
You're a popular man,dr. Ogden.

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,340
Well,when you're responsible for finding body parts that save lives,you have no idea.

123
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,380
I had one gentleman offer me his cattle ranch in montana.

124
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,690
People,they get desperate.Right?Did you take him up on it?

125
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,300
That would be dishonest,agent booth.

126
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,150
If anything,this office  built on the goodness of people.

127
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,220
Cullen,amy A.Bone graft number 4-4-2-9.

128
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,510
All right.According to my report...

129
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:49,380
the bone that was donated was harvested from a 25-year-old.

130
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,200
Can you give us the name of the donor?

131
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,110
I can't provide you with that information.

132
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,530
What about other recipients?

133
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,340
Any other patients here get a part from the same body?

134
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,500
When I said I couldn't tell you,it's because we have no way of knowing.

135
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,220
You'd have to ask the tissue bank for that.

136
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,390
Biotech tissue services.

137
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,230
We've been using them for a long time;never had a problem.

138
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,730
Amy cullen has a problem.She's dying.

139
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,840
Through no fault of this office,I'm sure.

140
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,890
If we can be of any further assistance,don't hesitate to call.

141
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:23,200
Thanks for being so sympathetic.We'll check into it.

142
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,170
New osteologic scans to input,as requested.

143
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,010
Hey,check this out.

144
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,500
Monet?

145
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,930
Amy cullen.--You're kidding.

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,220
No. I ran it through the digitizer.

147
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,390
She's a good kid.

148
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,660
I wanted to show her that computers don't have to be the enemy.

149
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,820
Not bad for a certified member of the geek squad.

150
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,740
I'll take that as a compliment.

151
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,950
You should.

152
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,130
This is a cross-section from amy's bone graft.

153
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,790
Zack,what's the ratio of primary to secondary osteons?

154
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:09,440
I only see secondary.Exactly what you'd expect to see in an older decedent.

155
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,210
And accompanying data?

156
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,860
I'm no expert,but I think it supports,as well.

157
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,390
So,based on this one sample,it's clear that 

158
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,380
the donor bone came from someone in their 60'S.

159
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,660
But how do we know it's the bone that gave amy cancer?

160
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,780
Because of this.Magnify.

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,810
The graft is riddled with cancer.

162
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,450
Cancer consistent with morphology origin in the pleura.

163
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,470
Most likely mesothelioma.

164
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,320
Whoever this is had terminal cancer.

165
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,230
And now so does amy.

166
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,800
She went in for a broken leg and was poisoned.

167
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,710
She never even had a chance.

168
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,750
Someone knew that bone was infected,and they gave it to her,anyway.

169
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,330
This will kill amy cullen.

170
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,000
Well,in that case,it's murder.

171
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,800
your daughter's cancer originated in the bone graft.The test confirms it.

172
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,400
It was the operation?

173
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,600
Not only was the bone contaminated by malignancy,

174
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,960
it was significantly older than documented.

175
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,500
It was expired or something?

176
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,980
No,sir,it came from a much older donor.

177
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,260
Someone in their 60'S.

178
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,890
Hospital error.

179
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,750
The next step would be to find out where the graft came from and 

180
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,230
how it slipped through the system.

181
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,420
This is not fbi jurisdiction.

182
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,060
It's a question of justice.

183
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:05,420
Does this in any way change my daughter's prognosis?

184
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,070
No.

185
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,250
So she's still going to die of this cancer.

186
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,670
Barring spontaneous remission,

187
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,140
the likelihood is significant.

188
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,840
The fbi is not my personal police force.

189
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,300
I appreciate what you've discovered.

190
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,770
Call charlie hammond,cdc.

191
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,740
Tell him what happened.They'll continue the investigation.

192
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:36,670
My team can still...--we'll notify cdc right away.

193
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,240
So that's it?Whoever did this to amy cullen just gets away? 

194
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,940
No. What we do now is we find out a way to make this a legitimate fbi case.

195
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,120
If one graft is infected,there's no telling how many others are outhere.

196
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,360
Jeez,you know,I feel like i'm on a serial-kill case

197
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,100
 just waiting for another victim to surface.--You're not far off.

198
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,070
What if biotech makes a habit of selling diseased parts?

199
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,590
Well,then it becomes fbi business if one of these tainted grafts is sold across state line.

200
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,410
Well,you can spit into four states from where we are right now.

201
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,630
What?

202
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,140
Not... literally.

203
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,750
Okay,first,we have to find out if this tissue lab is servicing any other hospitals.

204
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,990
See if they've killed anyone else.

205
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,450
Amy cullen is not dead,bones.--I'm afraid there's a degree of inevitability.

206
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,290
Sorry.

207
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,290
it's pretty excellent,huh?

208
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,080
Is that mine?

209
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,200
How'd you do that?

210
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,660
Most of the time,I restore and enhance old bones,so...

211
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,200
this was a lot more fun.

212
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,010
It's hard,you know.

213
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,640
One second I'm at school,I'm going to be an artist.

214
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,240
And the next...

215
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,280
my friends don't know what to say.

216
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,410
My parents are scared.

217
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,400
Things change,I guess.

218
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,820
Yeah.

219
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,150
Yeah,sometimes they do.

220
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,940
Angela?

221
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,680
Is the louvre just unbelievable?

222
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:47,470
It's the most beautiful place you'll ever see.

223
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,850
Maybe you can tell me about it sometime.

224
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,820
You'll go there yourself.

225
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,690
I know you will.

226
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:11,120
270,here's biotech.When we get in there,we'll sweat the head guy.

227
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,380
hello?F... bi.

228
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:19,190
Okay.So this is biotech.

229
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,220
Sorry I couldn't be any more help.

230
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,700
Thanks,I appreciate it.

231
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,720
All right,building manager says biotech went belly-up two years ago.

232
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,500
They couldn't even pay the last month's rent.

233
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,250
Where'd they go?

234
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,480
Well,he doesn't know.

235
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,180
What,two years ago?

236
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,340
Exactly. And,I mean, amy cullen's graft was sold

237
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,230
to washington general 12 months ago.

238
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,360
If biotech doesn't exist,who sold the diseased bone to the hospital?

239
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,460
Where is he?

240
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,420
Dr. Ogden had to oversee the transport of a liver to baltimore.

241
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,740
He won't be back until morning.

242
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,900
Oh,a liver?Where'd he get this one from,huh?An alcoholic at a corner bar?

243
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,810
We've dealt with biotech for years.They're very reputable.

244
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,640
There's no such company as biotech.

245
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,070
That's not possible.

246
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,140
Well,you know what I think?I think ogden's in on the whole thing.

247
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,620
A little bio-medical payola.Buys third-rate parts in exchange for a condo in st. Croix.

248
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,490
Dr. Ogden's a very good man.

249
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,990
I know there were problems in his past,but that'S...

250
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,940
oh,you mean there are skeletons in his closet.Well,I can't wait to see this guy's record.

251
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,670
Alexandra,is there any way to tell 

252
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:21,180
if a patient at washington general received a graft from the same donor as amy cullen?

253
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,200
Only the tissue lab knows for sure.

254
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,270
But... after you left,I was curious,and...

255
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,420
please.It's already too late for amy,but...

256
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,550
it might not be for someone else.

257
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,180
A woman named kelly demarco.

258
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,980
It was a car accident.

259
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,280
This is booth.

260
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,660
I need a phone and address for a kelly demarco in the potomac area.

261
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,030
Two grafts,same day as amy.Both grafts came from biotech.

262
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,510
When?

263
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,050
You sure?What is it?

264
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,410
Thanks.Kelly demarco.She's dead.

265
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,000
Oh,my god.

266
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,400
We need to know for sure if she had the same kind of cancer.We have to exhume her.

267
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,510
kelly demarco,age 32,died of lung cancer two months ago.

268
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,350
Take a biopsy of this ulna graft from ms. Demarco,

269
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,940
and compare it with the core sample from amy's leg.

270
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,730
Now,look,I spoke to demarco's husband.

271
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,320
She had the accident,she had all the operations.

272
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,060
You know,never smoked a cigarette in her whole life,

273
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,390
only to die of lung cancer eight months ago.

274
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,990
When your number's up,I guess,right?

275
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,730
I never understood that saying:"When your number's up."

276
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,660
Numbers and equations are quantitative and predictable.

277
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,850
Everyone knows when a number's up.

278
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,710
How do you listen to this all day?

279
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,450
I find intelligence soothing.

280
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,040
It's amazing how quickly this spread.

281
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,140
The grafts went into this woman's body,

282
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,570
and within weeks the cancer cells metastasized to her lungs.

283
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,340
By then the disease was unstoppable.

284
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,280
Same bones,same donor.Same disease.

285
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,090
Oh,look,I got three agents out there right now searching for biotech.

286
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,630
But all we have to work on is this e-mail address assigned to a fictitious name.

287
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:10,150
Okay,let's just say that ogden and this fake tissue lab are in cahoots.

288
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,280
How many other bones out there could be from the same donor?

289
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,580
There are 206 bones in the human body,agent booth.

290
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,170
Of those,any number of them are graftable.

291
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,330
Okay,you're saying that hundreds of people could still be out there

292
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,180
with cancer time-bombs in them and not even realize it?

293
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,970
We need to call every hospital in the D. C. Area.

294
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,540
If they acquired biotech grafts at the same time as amy,

295
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,420
those recipients need to be tracd down and tested immediately.

296
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,090
Fine.If you're right,then the bureau can then officially designate this a "serial killing."

297
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,510
Agent booth?The records you've been waiting for.

298
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,270
Well,look at this.Alexandra combs,she wasn't lying.

299
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,190
Background check turns up that ogden was fired from a private hospital in denver.

300
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,480
Reason?--Accepting a bribe for bumping someone up on the donor lists.

301
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,710
The guy is dirty.

302
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,630
Look.What I did in denver was wrong,but I did it for good reason.

303
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,780
To line your pockets?

304
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,790
The money went to keep a struggling clinic afloat.

305
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,390
Besides,it came from a family that could afford it.

306
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,010
So taking advantage of wealthy people is okay?

307
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,440
I'm not saying I'm proud of what I did,dr. Brennan,

308
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,650
but just because i took that bribe doesn't mean I had anything to do with this.

309
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,860
Why don't you tell us about your relationship with biotech?

310
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,940
Same that I have with every company I deal with--a virtual one.

311
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,750
E-mails,on-line financial transactions.

312
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:36,090
My assistant sends out a country-wide search for the organ or bone that we're looking for.

313
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,110
They respond back,and we bid.

314
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,140
If we can reach an agreement,then the part is immediately transported for surgery.

315
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,660
And in amy cullen's case?

316
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,360
Same protocol:I bid,I bought,I received.No conversations were had.

317
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,250
We are not required to check out suppliers each and every time we take an order.

318
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,160
You know what,ogden,I'm going to contact every bank you've done business with.

319
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,660
If I find one deposit that's suspicious,you know what?You're mine.

320
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:04,130
I swear to you i am not involved in this.I haven't hurt anybody.

321
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,820
Your work is awesome.

322
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,190
Thanks.

323
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,250
There's so much going on,you know.

324
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,200
So much to feel.I just don't know if I'll ever be able to do something like this.

325
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,950
You will.Just give it time.

326
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,150
Well,I may not have a lot of that.

327
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,350
Your paintings and your sculpture.

328
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,670
They're alive,you know?It's like..

329
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:35,190
you're showing me how you felt when you painted them.What you've experienced.

330
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,320
I can't paint what I don't know.

331
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,500
Amy,you've been through more than most people.

332
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,790
You mean dying?

333
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,680
It's not enough.

334
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,030
I really think it's best for you to stay positive.

335
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,690
Keep doing things,you mean?

336
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,850
With your art?Yeah,absolutely.

337
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,620
What about guys?

338
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,850
Ah,well.that totally goes without saying.

339
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,560
What's his name?

340
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:06,060
Aaron.His family just moved here from maine.

341
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,460
Is he cute?

342
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,910
He's so cute.

343
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,050
Did you ask him out?

344
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,630
No. He asked me,but,I...I don't know,I said no.

345
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,920
Well,why?

346
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,860
Look,you haven't asked my advice,

347
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,180
so I'm just going to give it to you.Okay?

348
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,200
Just have fun.

349
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,010
You know,every once in a while,you...

350
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,470
you might meet somebody who's worth it.

351
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,190
What if he's not?

352
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,160
Then you've got something else to paint about.

353
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,770
The bureau's canvassed every hospital in the area.

354
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,650
Four have been using biotech bone grafts.

355
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,420
And three recipients from those hospitals have lung cancer.

356
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,100
Here's another one.And this one died of lung cancer three months ago.

357
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,660
I'm checking on a burial site.

358
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,390
That makes 13,including amy and the demarco woman.

359
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,560
Probably all from the same donor.

360
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,140
We're still waiting on bethesda naval hospital.

361
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,630
Can you id these people?

362
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,980
Yeah,names and addresses on all of them.

363
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:17,030
I've already contacted washington general to set up a biopsy testing facility.

364
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:22,120
Whew,man.How can one dead guy do so much damage?

365
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,560
That's a good idea.

366
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,060
What idea?

367
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,620
Identify the donor,and we might be able to find out how biotech got his bones.

368
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,800
Got it.Second decedent's name is ronald lupo.

369
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,300
I found him at a cemetery in lynchburg.

370
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,290
Virginia?

371
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,130
Yeah,why?

372
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,800
Because it means that this fraud just crossed state lines 

373
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,530
and became a legitimate case for the fbi.

374
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,220
Looks like I don't have to use my sick days anymore,huh?

375
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:50,890
How many?

376
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,170
Sick or dead?--dead.

377
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,960
Two. 

378
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,410
That we know of.But that makes it a multiple homicide case.

379
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:02,240
And since it's not isolated to the district,and the recipients are in multiple states...

380
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,460
this falls under fbi jurisdiction.

381
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,950
Yes,sir.

382
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,800
I should kick your ass.

383
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,230
Yeah.

384
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:16,100
What'd you do,take sick time to work on this?

385
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,780
Yeah.Migraine.

386
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,530
Thanks,booth.

387
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,190
Catch the son of a bitch that did this to my daughter.

388
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,810
That's absolutely my intention,sir.

389
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,350
Results?

390
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,430
So far there are three other early signs of cancer cells.

391
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,210
Aggressive chemo and radiation treatments should be able to slow it down.

392
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,530
Admiring your handiwork,doctor?

393
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,720
I'm sorry.

394
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,480
Amy?

395
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,580
Let me.

396
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,220
Easy.

397
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,960
Hey.You all right?

398
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,580
Did all these people get bones from the same donor I did?

399
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,970
Uh-huh.

400
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,890
Do they all have cancer?

401
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,490
No,not all of them.

402
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:09,240
But the sooner the ones who are infected know,the better.

403
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,370
Who would do a thing like that?

404
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,370
If they knew they were sick,why make other people sick,too?

405
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,340
I don't know.It's terrible.

406
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,850
But that's what we're trying to figure out.

407
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:26,000
So,if you take the bad grafts out, will they be okay?

408
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,700
Some of 'em.

409
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,540
But...not me?

410
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,140
No.

411
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,620
I want this out of me.

412
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,090
Sweetheart,you're not strong enough...

413
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,540
get them to take it out.

414
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,340
Amy,you have to understand.All of these people...

415
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,780
I don't care!

416
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:53,300
You're saving their lives.

417
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,150
We've traced all these grafts back to the donor and still know almost nothing.

418
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,120
Well,not exactly nothing.

419
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,700
Zack,look at the slope of the sciatic notch in the pelvis.

420
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,150
And the non-elevated auricular surface.

421
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,270
He was definitely male.

422
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:23,510
The osteon count in the femoral joint confirms the donor was over 60.

423
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,990
It's a solid start,but we need a lot more.

424
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,920
Osteophytosis with 

425
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,020
narrowing of intervertebral spaces indicates consistent heavy lifting.

426
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,030
Construction worker?

427
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,650
It's hard to say,exactly.Definitely a burly type.

428
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,990
If we can keep guessing about what he was like on the inside,

429
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:48,970
then angela can hypothesize about his appearance,size,weight.

430
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,200
I'm on it.

431
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,500
I scanned in the x-rays of all the graft recipients,

432
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,170
as well as the pieces from the exhumed bodies.

433
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,690
Okay.Now what?

434
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,060
Connect the dots?

435
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,870
More like connect the body parts.

436
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,100
Think of it as sculpting from the inside out.

437
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,010
The more that I know about our donor,

438
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,180
the better i can guess what he might have looked like.

439
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,480
The fragments originated from nine sites on the donor's body.

440
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,740
If we connect the grafts...

441
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:21,870
now input all the anatomical factors and core anomalies.

442
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,850
Guys,meet donor x,the man who caused all this pain.

443
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,140
So that's our serial killer.

444
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,780
God,he probably had no idea how much damage he was gonna cause.

445
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:36,930
Do we have enough to track him down?

446
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,110
Hodgins?

447
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,600
Maybe.With libs.

448
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,630
Who's libs?

449
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,840
Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy.

450
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,440
It'll give us an elemental analysis of the old bastard.

451
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,200
Angela told us what he looked like.

452
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,450
Now hodgins can tell us where lived.

453
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,790
Well,we'll find him.

454
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,120
We have to.

455
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:15,670
Strontium isotope levels suggest donor x lived the last 20 years on the east coast.

456
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,730
Extremely low levels of fluoride in the cancellous bone.

457
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,650
Unusual,since most tap water is fluoridated.

458
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,580
Except for parts of the appalachian mountains.

459
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,670
A few of the hatfields and the mccoys still have no teeth.

460
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,420
So,we're looking for someone from tennessee,west virginia,or north carolina.

461
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,700
Oh,great. That,uh,narrows it down.

462
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:38,790
High levels of c8.That's a key ingredient of teflon.

463
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,810
There's a teflon plant in parkersburg,west virginia.

464
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,720
And miniscule traces of nuclear sub particles.

465
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,350
Wasn't there a problem about 15 years ago at  brant's cliff power facility?

466
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,390
Yeah,just a little one.

467
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:55,060
Employees there were growing a second head.Can you say cover-up?

468
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,180
Okay,where's brant's cliff?

469
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,700
West virginia,also.

470
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:00,880
Okay,fine.So then we're trying to id a guy who's 65 years of age,

471
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:06,240
roughly 200 pounds,lives in west virginia,died of lung cancer within the last year,right?

472
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:14,150
Hey,look,there are three potential west virginia donors we could be talking about.

473
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:17,840
There's-there's lester blake out of tague.There's blair simmons out of...

474
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,430
hey,lady,watch where you're driving!

475
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,090
I'd rather not be a donor myself.

476
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:29,110
Blair simmons out of daily.And william hastings out of beard's fork.

477
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,390
All three men died of mesothelioma last august.

478
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,090
Okay,we'll be in beard's fork within about an hour,okay?

479
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,070
You sure zack and hodgins are on the other two,right?

480
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,820
this is brennan.

481
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,950
Dr. Brennan,I'm at lester blake's exhumation.I've examined the remains.

482
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,040
this is booth.

483
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,100
Blair simmons isn't dead.

484
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,050
What?

485
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,750
He's frozen.In a cryogenics lab.

486
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,870
What do you mean,frozen?

487
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,420
Like a supermarket turkey.Not a scratch on him.

488
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,540
And I think he's wedged between walt disney and ted williams.

489
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,170
There's no sign of body tampering,

490
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,870
and it's clear his casket hasn't been opened since his burial.

491
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,080
So,if blake isn't our donor...

492
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,790
so if simmons isn't our donor...

493
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:09,100
mrs. Hastings,what did your husband do for a living?

494
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,150
Ah,this and that.

495
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,690
Bill worked in construction for a time.Did the night shift down at brant's cliff.

496
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,120
Opened a roofing business a few years back.

497
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,030
Roofing?

498
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,460
Shingling and fire proofing and such.

499
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,560
So he handled asbestos?

500
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,180
Doctors say that's what finally got him.

501
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,230
Why are you all so curious?

502
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,990
well,mrs. Hastings,your husband did time for petty theft and fraud.

503
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,880
And you lost your home,your cars.And he left you with nothing.

504
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,690
Ah,bill hastings was an old fool who deserved what came to him.

505
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,160
You needed money.Did anyone approach you about selling his parts after he died?

506
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,740
Pardon?I-I'm afraid I don't follow.

507
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:51,670
Well,his family has a cemetery plot in kincaid,yet you cremated him.

508
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,580
Are you...are you hiding something?

509
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,460
I did that because the guy at the funeral home said it was cheaper.

510
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,900
We couldn't afford a proper burial.

511
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,420
What funeral home?

512
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,440
Um,it was called martin...I think.

513
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,500
Where are the ashes?

514
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,880
Out back in the rd.

515
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,600
Would you mind if we take a sample?

516
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,090
I sure as hell do.

517
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,990
I don't like what y'all are accusing me of doing.

518
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,270
All right,we'll just come back with a warrant,that's all.

519
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,660
You better bring you some dogs 

520
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,970
and bring those trigger-happy agents of yours,too,'cause this conversation is over.

521
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,440
Come on,bones,let's go.Have a nice day.

522
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:35,040
Look,she insists that her husband wasn't the donor,but the evidence is overwhelming.

523
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,820
If I could get my hands on a soil sample,

524
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:41,020
I know there are bone fragments still intact that we can positively identify him with.

525
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,150
Was there an insurance policy in place?

526
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,710
None. More reason to sell the illegal grafts.

527
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,510
Look,the funeral home had to have been in cahoots with her.

528
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,550
So,all you have to do is connect the widow to the funeral home.

529
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,270
Then the home to biotech.

530
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,340
Mr. Cullen? 

531
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,170
We need to speak to you and amy's mother privately.

532
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,410
She's telling them the treatment didn't work.

533
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:23,040
And there's nothing else they can do.

534
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:29,320
I hate seeing them so sad.

535
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,950
Bones? Bones?Bones,I know that you find dead people intriguing,

536
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:07,290
but just try to put on your sad face.

537
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,340
I'm sorry.I'm in the middle of a service.

538
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:22,840
Well,this will only take a minute.Uh,mr... jessup--he-he ain't going nowhere.

539
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,580
And what's this about,exactly?

540
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,720
William hastings.

541
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,830
Uh,is he someone you've lost?

542
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,620
More like somebody we've found.

543
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,820
He passed away a year ago.You cremated him,but somehow,

544
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:36,390
his bones were illegally harvested prior to the procedure.

545
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,340
Uh,not here.

546
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,340
What do you mean?

547
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,710
Well,this is my mortuary.

548
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:45,040
I've been in business almost a decade,and I have no recollection whatsoever of a mr. Hastings.

549
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,850
His wife mentioned this place specifically.

550
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,340
It's unfortunate, but the bereaved are often confused.

551
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,050
In this case,I don't think so.

552
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,280
We don't think so.

553
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,660
If you'll excuse me,I have mourners waiting.

554
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,820
Well,maybe you can just double-check your records and get back to me.

555
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,650
I would,but my records are impeccable.There's nothing to double-check.

556
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,010
That was quick.

557
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,460
I need to get those ashes from her yard.

558
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,130
You got' em. All right,I'll get the warrant.

559
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,320
And don't forget the dogs and the gun toting agents she asked for.

560
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,380
Oh,believe me,trust me,I won't forget that.

561
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,850
So I looked it up on the internet.

562
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:29,940
You can get $10,000 for grafts on the black market these days.

563
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,320
ten grand?Jeez,my bones are worth more than that.

564
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,560
What makes you so special?

565
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,540
Three glasses of milk a day,I work out,and i eat right.

566
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:41,310
X-ray micro-fluorescence shows a high concentration of calcium carbonate.

567
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,900
That's a revelation.

568
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,790
Seriously,hodgins,is there anything that we can link to william hastings' medical records?

569
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,200
Everything tracks.

570
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,560
The cremains are consistent to those of william hastings.

571
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,060
Question I keep asking is, if the widow is guilty,why keep the remains so close to home?

572
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,770
What if she didn't know about it?

573
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,180
Oh,come on,bones.She hated the guy.

574
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,380
My guess is she's got ten gs stuffed in her mattress back in trailerville.

575
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:07,030
No,I mean it.There are no unusual bank records,no deposits.

576
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,980
What if they took the grafts,gave her back the ashes,and she was none the wiser?

577
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,770
Man,is she going to be pissed.

578
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:16,910
So,if it's not the widow hastings,I'm doubling down on the mortician. Everybody in?

579
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,900
You in?

580
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,030
Ah,jeez.

581
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:34,300
Excuse me. This body is being prepped.What do you want?

582
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,440
What we want is to know where you harvested mr. Hastings' body.

583
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:40,450
I told you,I don't know who hastings is.

584
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,090
Well,we think you're lying.

585
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:45,230
We think you're selling bone and tissue grafts illegally.

586
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,420
And I think your accusations are outlandish,and you should call my lawyer.

587
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,320
Yeah? Well,we have a warrant here to look around a little.

588
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,870
What's this place?

589
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:01,630
Casket showroom.They're having a sale.

590
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,790
It's like a sick department store.

591
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,850
All right,you know what?Nobody would be cutting anybody up in this place.Let's go.

592
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:11,530
Whoa. Wait.Over there.

593
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,450
What?It's a water line.What's the big deal?

594
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:17,300
But the floor slopes toward the center of the room.

595
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,770
This wasn't always used for a showroom.

596
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,830
I wonder what's under the carpet.

597
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:29,010
If body work was done in here,they'd need a drain.

598
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,910
You kidding me?It's a drain?

599
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:36,020
This is our sales office.There is nothing in here you need to see.

600
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,670
The only thing in this room is caskets.

601
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,090
I'm not so sure about that.

602
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,040
You're making a mistake.

603
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,270
Am I?

604
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,160
She's ruining my merchandise!

605
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,540
Come on. How much is that one?

606
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:51,970
$7,000.--bones,watch the scuff marks

607
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:56,740
Mr. Martin,this room is designed to be washed clean.You've got drains in the floor.

608
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,310
I think this is where you did the bone harvesting.

609
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,440
When you thought we were coming back,you moved everything around.

610
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:04,810
That's absurd.I did no such thing.

611
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:07,380
You're an excellent house cleaner.

612
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:12,500
But in the carpeting and tidying up,you forgot about one thing.

613
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,070
Bone dust.

614
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,360
You forgot about airborne particles.

615
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,780
today,zack.I need something today.

616
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,290
Hey,don't harass my assistant.

617
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,010
That's right.That's our job.

618
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,550
I sifted dust particles through a series of filters,

619
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,210
then separated the largest pieces and magnified them to compare the osteons.

620
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,410
The particles in the vent definitely came from cutting human skeletal remains.

621
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,460
William hastings' remains?

622
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,810
I'm comparing particles to the biopsy we excised from kelly demarco.

623
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,710
Compare.

624
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,500
So?Is it him?

625
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,430
It's him.

626
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,350
But here's the kickster...

627
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,770
"kicker," bones.Here's the kicker.

628
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,610
There's bone dust from at least seven other bodies in that vent filter as well.

629
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,790
Seven?

630
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:10,250
Cutting through periosteum for grafting purposes takes medical training.

631
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:13,670
Except for the tainted samples, these bone grafts are expertly harvested.

632
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,030
Okay,so we're looking for someone who has medical training.

633
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,340
Martin is a mortician,not a doctor.

634
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:23,700
Let's say he's running a chop shop.Let's say he was selling illegal parts to tissue labs.

635
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,390
Who was actually doing the cutting?

636
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:29,140
And who was selling to hospitals as biotech?

637
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,100
How much money have you made over the years doing this,nick? 

638
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:40,510
Tens,oh,hundreds of thousands of dollars?

639
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,170
I don't know what you're talking about.

640
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,470
William hastings had an aggressive form of cancer that was very rare.

641
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:48,630
You made some pocket change off his grafts.You didn't even tell his wife.

642
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:52,850
Now a bunch of people are sick.Two died.You're looking at multiple counts of mudder.

643
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,260
I didn't kill anybody.

644
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,790
No,no,you didn't kill anybody.

645
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,410
Mean,they were already dead.You were just recycling.

646
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,900
I didn't do anything wrong.

647
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,270
You have any doctor training?

648
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:04,120
No.--Spend any time in the service as a medic or a nurse?

649
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,070
No.--Then who did the cutting?

650
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,410
Who did the cutting of the grafts,huh?Somebody knew what they were doing.

651
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:12,010
Your phone records show that during the months around hastings' death,

652
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,770
you received dozens of calls from disposable cells.

653
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:18,530
Four different ones,huh?What do you make of that?

654
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,340
I don't recall this.

655
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,450
You know what?The dust that we got off the vent in your showroom

656
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:29,380
matched hastings and seven other bodies.Who do you work with?

657
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,290
I don't know what you're talking about.

658
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,030
I think you do.I think you and your partners knew 

659
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,640
that the bones were cancerous,and you didn't care!

660
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:41,440
Who is it,huh?Who the hell did this to my daughter?!Huh?!

661
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,320
I got him,sir.Please.

662
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,920
Bones,how long is it going to take you to...

663
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,650
bones?!Come on.

664
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,700
Oh,dr. Brennan.You startled me.

665
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,230
Mind if I come in?

666
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,170
Not at all.

667
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,430
I was just trying to keep things organized.

668
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,540
What we do here is so important.

669
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,080
We can't risk making any mistakes.

670
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,760
Ms. Combs,tell me,what do you use these phones for?

671
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,090
Recipients,primarily.

672
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,400
We never know when a donor organ is going to come in.

673
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,410
So it's imperative that they can be reached at all times.

674
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,650
Ever use one yourself?

675
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,440
What can I do for you,doctor?

676
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,340
Have you always wanted to work in a hospital?

677
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:32,020
I mean,it's incredibly rewarding,I know.But you ever want to study medicine?

678
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,280
I did at one time. Yes.

679
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,020
How do you feel,ms. Combs?

680
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:40,200
Have you been coughing at all?Do you feel a tightness in your chest?

681
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,070
I feel fine,actually.

682
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,500
How often does dr. Ogden write prescriptions?

683
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,290
Rarely.As coordinator,he doesn't practice.

684
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,190
Yet the pharmacy downstairs told the fbi  

685
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,380
that he wrote you a script for an expectorant for a cough.

686
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,300
Well,there must be some mistake.He'd never...

687
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:58,650
you wrote that prescription yourself,didn't you?

688
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:02,880
I know what you've been doing with martin,to hastings and the others.

689
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,310
See,if you'd finished medical school,you'd know.

690
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:08,520
Bone dust is very dangerous if inhaled.

691
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:12,080
When you were taking those grafts,I doubt you were wearing a mask.

692
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:19,150
You're sick,ms. Combs.And I don't just mean in a mentally disturbed way.

693
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:23,000
This is ridiculous.You can't prove anything.

694
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:26,850
We're in a hospital.Why don't we go get a chest x-ray and find out?

695
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,650
I'd like to read you your rights.

696
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,220
Alexandra, what's going on?

697
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,690
So the transplant assistant fancied herself a doctor?

698
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,940
Not a doctor exactly,but qualified enough to extricate bone grafts from a cadaver.

699
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,100
And what about biotech tissue labs?

700
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,610
Once,it was a legitimate company.

701
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,640
Combs kept it alive on the web and 

702
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,340
funneled the money into her own well-disguised bank account.

703
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,480
So where does that leave amy?

704
00:39:55,540 --> 00:40:00,330
Same as where she started,just with answers,that's all.

705
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,050
Well,that is perfect.

706
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,460
Angela.--It's okay.I got it.

707
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,590
Hey.

708
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,830
Hey.

709
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,330
You all right?

710
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,470
Yeah.

711
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:24,890
No.No,I'm not.

712
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:28,410
Look,we can solve 100-year-old crimes.

713
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:36,460
We can track down serial killers and identify people when nothing is left of them but sludge.

714
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:42,190
So why can't we help a 15-year-old girl?

715
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:50,460
All she wants to do is fall in love and visit the louvre.

716
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,310
You can do that.

717
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,800
What do you mean?

718
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:00,130
You made a whole guy out of bone chips and lights.

719
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:03,200
You can create the louvre.

720
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,810
What about love?

721
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,410
What do you have to say about love?

722
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,950
It's overrated.

723
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,870
Most of the time.

724
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,570
Okay.

725
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,400
Now,tell me what you see.

726
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:49,270
Oh,wow,no way.Angela,this is unbelievable.

727
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,660
Welcome to the louvre.

728
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,390
I'm really there.

729
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,590
That's amazing.

730
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,820
Is this your doing,dr. Brennan?

731
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,540
No,sir.It's all ms. Montenegro.

732
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,590
Thank you,angela.

733
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:10,930
You're welcome.So what do you think?

734
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,830
I think it's like heaven.

735
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,990
I don't know what to say.

736
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,330
Don't say anything.

737
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,700
You don't have to.
