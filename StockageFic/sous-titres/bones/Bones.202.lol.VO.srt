1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,840
***** washed up on the bay.
They think it could be Carlie Richardson.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,760
And I'm supposed to know who that is?

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,350
Yeah. Disappeared a year ago,
she was pregnant.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,860
Come on,Bones.
You have to get a TV,you know.

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,320
Or at least just thumb through a People at the checkout stand.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,120
Was it in the Journal  of Forensic Anthropology?

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,710
Oh,you know,I forgot to renew my subscription.
You know what,Bones?

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,560
You really need to take up some other interests.

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,450
I'm reading Ted Joya's  History of Jazz.
Was she mentioned in there?

10
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,920
Or maybe in McGee's  Science and Lore  of the Kitchen.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,230
Or perhaps I should develop an interest
in the mainstream media's exploitation of crimes

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,420
for their entertainment value.

13
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,500
It's amazing,Bones.
You can really be snotty sometimes.

14
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,340
So,Carlie Richardson?

15
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,290
Carlie Richardson,newlywed.
Everyone assumed that she was murdered.

16
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,290
Husband was cheating on her,

17
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,820
there was evidence that they had a fight that day.

18
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,220
He was covered in scratches.
Witnesses said that they saw him down by the marina.

19
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,890
But,hey,you know,without the body,
they had to kick him free.

20
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,640
Well,if she's been in the water for a year,

21
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,580
the bones will be saturated.

22
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,570
I'll need nylon mesh bagging and...

23
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,430
Cam's bringing in everything  on the truck.

24
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,550
Well,after a year,
there's not going to be a lot of flesh for Cam to deal with.

25
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,660
Well,you know,hey,Bones,
you know,Cam,she's in charge now.

26
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,080
She runs the place,it's her call.

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,280
Then let's hurry.
I don't want my remains compromised.

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,530
Okay.

29
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,120
I don't care if she's the boss.

30
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,410
The bones belong to me.

31
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,040
Booth. Oh,yeah.

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,760
Rebecca. Whoa,wait a second. Slow down,okay?

33
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,100
This is my weekend with Parker,okay?

34
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,530
I am his father,all right?

35
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,640
Stu is your boyfriend.

36
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,660
We're gonna be in the water,Doc.
Remember to bring Traxon and soluble tape.

37
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,290
Does she think I'm new at this?

38
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,090
I developed the use of Traxon...

39
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,240
- On the phone,Bones.
- I know. Get off. We have to go.

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,550
Rebecca,he's spending a lot of time with Parker
and I don't even know this guy.

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,360
She took Zack. Zack's mine.

42
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,130
Because you know what?

43
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,320
I just want to make sure that he's a good influence.

44
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,880
The fact that he,you know,

45
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,680
rocks,rocks your world,surprisingly that...

46
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,640
really,you know doesn't concern me.

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,600
I'll just meet you there.

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,260
Doesn't concern me.

49
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,380
I got to run,okay,Rebecca?
We'll talk about this later.

50
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,590
Wait up!

51
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,810
Why can't you go faster?

52
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,240
I don't see why
I couldn't drive.

53
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,840
- Because you're agitated.
- I am not.

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,810
You know what?
You've turned this into a competition between you and Cam.

55
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,790
I just like to be first on the scene,that's all,
to protect the evidence.

56
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,240
She's not going to disturb anything.

57
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,720
No,it's all tissue and blood and DNA with her.

58
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,810
She doesn't appreciate the skeletal system.

59
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,010
You could take the I-70. It'll be quicker.

60
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,210
Don't backseat drive,okay?

61
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,330
Oh,I think I know who's agitated.

62
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,260
Someone is annoying me,okay?
That's different.

63
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,510
- Your ex.
- Huh?

64
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,960
That's who's annoying you.
Because she has a new man in her life.

65
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,860
That's funny,you know,okay?
I am concerned about my son.

66
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,800
I want to know what kind of guy
this new boyfriend is.

67
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,150
And you know what?
If she's not going to tell me,I'll find out on my own.

68
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,970
Are you gonna run a background check on him?

69
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,250
When you have kids,we'll talk.

70
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,990
It's a lot to ask for a little conversation.

71
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,690
If you make a right,we can cut through Grafton.

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,080
Fine.

73
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,760
She beat us here and she was in a truck.

74
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,690
Well,you know,you're the one
who wanted to go through Grafton.

75
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,150
Well,you could have used the siren.
I mean,why do you have one if you're not going to use it?

76
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,100
Oh! What's that smell?

77
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,830
Zack,I need some sterile tubes before she's fertilizer.

78
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,190
Okay,that's the smell.

79
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,210
Caucasian,female,

80
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,190
25 to 30.

81
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,110
Barnacle and small mussel encrustation

82
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,510
indicates she's been in the water for about a year.

83
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,790
No. They have.

84
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,790
God.

85
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,780
The size of the fetal bones indicates the fetus was viable.

86
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,990
How could someone do this to their own kid?

87
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,190
Multiple fractures.

88
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,590
They could be from an assault
or from being battered by rocks and debris while in the water.

89
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,100
Stab wounds evident on ribs,manubrium and clavicle.

90
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,410
And ulna,radius,one to the sphenoid.

91
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,420
This was a very violent attack.

92
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,070
You find the murder weapon?

93
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,070
Not yet. The scuba guys just got here.

94
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,500
Tell them to look for a left leg
and missing fetal bones.

95
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,240
Looks like we finally get to put Richardson away.

96
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,170
I love being a hero.

97
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,490
A heroine.

98
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,810
Mm,sounds too druggy.
I'm going with hero.

99
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,170
Whoa,what are you doing?

100
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,930
Scraping the adipocere
from the hands.

101
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,760
No,you could compromise the bone.

102
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,090
You should use suction back at the lab
if you want a conviction.

103
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,890
Of course,it's your call.

104
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,280
Are we gonna have another murder here,or what?

105
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,640
No,no. I have the utmost respect for the doc.

106
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,830
Glad she works for me.

107
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,630
Good.

108
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,900
The clothes,they match the ones
she was last seen wearing.

109
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,500
The rope could be a match of the type found
in Richardson's house.

110
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,150
While you two do your thing,
I'm gonna go bring the son of a bitch in.

111
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,140
- Where's Richardson?
- I don't know!

112
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,560
He saw this and then he took off.

113
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,380
I tried to stop him,but then he hit me.

114
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,620
He said he's never coming back!

115
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,850
Sources indicate both mother and her fetus
were stabbed to death.

116
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,580
Kyle Richardson remains the chief suspect.

117
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,210

120
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,030
***** is the evidence
taken from Kyle Richardson's house a year ago.

121
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:08,550
So,we got rope,the plastic sheeting,knife set,
one knife missing,Richardson's DNA results.

122
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,650
File says witnesses placed Richardson at the marina
on the bay the night she disappeared.

123
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,560
Looks like he's not walking this time,Seeley.

124
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,620
Ironic since he's running now.

125
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,030
Hodgins,you know Booth is bigger than you,right?

126
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,210
Right.

127
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,560
Wasn't your fault,dude.

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,060
Let's focus,people.
This should be a slam dunk.

129
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,380
We screw this one up,I'm gonna look like a fool
and someone's gonna have to pay for that.

130
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,750
We just started collecting evidence.

131
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,510
There are boxes of evidence.
The remains are icing on the cake.

132
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,750
Let's just hand the prosecutor what she needs

133
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,760
so I can have a nice weekend
knocking back shots and playing poker.

134
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,520
Yeah,that should motivate us.

135
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,030
I'm going to strip the flesh and adipocere,

136
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,240
remove anything from under the fingernails.

137
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,520
Here lies a dead fish in the plastic.

138
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,530
Ooh,and it's not even my birthday.

139
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,380
He saved the fish.

140
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,390
Stomach contents and particulates could give us drift patterns,

141
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,790
show where she was left before she washed ashore.

142
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,640
Not much left of the organs.

143
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,220
Looks like I can still find a few surprises

144
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,720
from what's left of this lung.

145
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,190
Looks like some liver here.

146
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,030
I'll take any tissue that stuck to the plastic.

147
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,920
There'll be sediment and organic particulates.

148
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,410
What do you want?

149
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,200
George Clooney naked
on a white sand beach,

150
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,540
but I can give you faces after the skull's reconstructed.

151
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,120
Zack will start on them right away.

152
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,810
After you've stripped any tissue,

153
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,510
I would like to reassemble the victim and the fetus.

154
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,460
Sounds like fun.
Let's do it.

155
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,790
It was male.

156
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,710
He,not it,
Bones.

157
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,840
I'm going to go talk to his girlfriend.
No mistakes on this one.

158
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,290
He always was a little touchy.

159
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,820
Yeah.

160
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,680
I didn't know Kyle then.

161
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,010
We started going out
after his wife went missing.

162
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,410
Mm-hmm. Did he ever mention the night she disappeared?

163
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,250
Of course.
It was terrible for him.

164
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,840
I just tried to support him and help him get past it.

165
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,280
He looks like he had a lot of people
to help him.

166
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,880
And he looks really,really broken up.

167
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,720
I know
he dated other women,

168
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,480
but he's not who you think he is.

169
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,210
No,of course not.

170
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,110
- Oh,my God!
- Agent Booth,is that necessary?

171
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,750
Just trying to help her remember.

172
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,130
He would never do this.

173
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,740
He could never do this.

174
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,540
He hit you when he was leaving,didn't he?

175
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,670
I know. That is because I wanted to go with him,

176
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,670
and he knew everyone would be after him.

177
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,260
He was just trying to protect me.

178
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,160
Yeah,he's a real prince.

179
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,410
If he contacts you...

180
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,230
call.

181
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,340
Otherwise,you're looking at obstruction of justice,aiding and abetting,

182
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,740
and I'm surewe can find a few other charges
to make it worth the money you're paying your lawyer.

183
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,380
There's another gash
on the second rib,right side,

184
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,240
approximately 45 degrees,left to right.

185
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,130
Why didn't he just divorce her?

186
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,370
Why did they have
to get married in the first place?

187
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,160
It's an antiquated ritual.

188
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,340
Carlie Richardson believed in it,

189
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,440
trusted her husband,and look what happened.

190
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,130
So this is marriage's fault?

191
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,690
Committing yourself to one person
isn't in the interest of the species.

192
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,870
I mean,you have
multiple partners.

193
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,960
Don't say it like that.

194
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,180
I date.

195
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,340
The notion
of a committed relationship's fantasy.

196
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,350
Look at Booth.
Fighting with his ex,his son caught in the middle.

197
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,940
We make our lives out of chaos and hope and
love.

198
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,450
Someday you'll meet somebody.

199
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,950
I don't need anything more
than I have now.

200
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,290
Talk about a fantasy.

201
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,400
The skulls are in multiple pieces,
but the damage is from debris in the water.

202
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,340
Then let's start on the stab wounds.

203
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,480
I'd like you to confirm the type
of knife used in each of these.

204
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,340
Oh,these all appear to be from the knife that was missing
from the set taken from Richardson's.

205
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,520
Appear?

206
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,430
No conclusions without corroboration.

207
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,460
But Dr. Saroyan seems certain that Richardson...

208
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,560
Seems? You're my grad student. You work for me.

209
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,870
Remember,Doc,we're building a case here,
not getting our rocks off on research.

210
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,380
Rocks and sediment are Hodgins' specialty.

211
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,220
You're serious?

212
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,200
Okay.

213
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,680
Brought your hand back.

214
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,630
I found organic material under the fingernails.
Should match Richardson.

215
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,020
And I found something else I'd like  you to look at.

216
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,260
It's right here in the lung.

217
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,880
It's a locket.

218
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,730
Must've been around her neck and melted
into the lung during putrefaction.

219
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,310
Before I remove it,

220
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,140
I wanted to see if any
of your cyborgs can do anything with the photo paper.

221
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,430
There's not enough left.
It's liquefied.

222
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,740
It's probably just another picture
of the lovebirds anyway.

223
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,760
Oh,what's this?

224
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,350
- Oh,no.
- Who's Kenny?

225
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,650
I don't know. I don't want to know.
I just want it to be Richardson.

226
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,640
That's right because of the drinking and the poker.

227
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,340
Yeah,I know there's a lot of animals at the zoo.

228
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,170
Monkeys... monkeys are Daddy's favorite.

229
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,030
They're just like people.

230
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:55,940
Actually,three million base pairs of the genome differ
in protein encodg and other functional areas.

231
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,490
What?

232
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,080
Genetic differences between chimps and humans.

233
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,730
I'm talking to a four-year-old,Bones.

234
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,950
Oh,yeah...

235
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,590
you're spending a lot of time with Drew,huh?
Oh,that's great.

236
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:11,040
Okay,you've got to go eat. Okay,go eat.
Make sure... okay,I love...

237
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,160
Yeah.

238
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,260
Her boyfriend spending a lot of time with your son?

239
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,370
Yeah.

240
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,000
So you got any,uh,new information for me,Bones?

241
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,640
I'm sorry. Nah,it's no need.

242
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,210
It must be hard
not being able to see him when you want to.

243
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,300
You see,this is information
that I already know,Bones. Why don't you--

244
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,860
Let's say we just discuss the case,hmm?

245
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,750
Sure.

246
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,370
You know,I'm his father.

247
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,100
You know,Parker knows that.

248
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,120
I mean,that's-that's what's important,
not some stupid trip to the zoo.

249
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,660
- Yeah,absolutely.
- Right.

250
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,290
- Yeah.
- Done. Of course. Boom.

251
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,380
Well,we found this in her lung.

252
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,010
What?

253
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,640
- Her lung?
- It was enveloped during decomp.

254
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,470
Kenny?

255
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,750
Any reference
to a Kenny in the case file?

256
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,830
No,but whoever Kenny is liked her enough to get her a locket.

257
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,950
Maybe Kyle wasn't the only one who was cheating.

258
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,000
Opens up a lot of possibilities.

259
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,980
I say we just go talk to Carlie's friends
and see if they know who Kenny is.

260
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,710
The four of us got so close being in the same Lamaze class.

261
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,420
Losing Carlie was like  losing a sister.

262
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,880
It was her idea to start this baby group.

263
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:30,240
We all felt so connected,feeling someone
growing inside,waiting to meet them.

264
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,850
- Do you have kids?
- He does.

265
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,390
They make you feel whole.

266
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,100
It's just a release of serotonin necessary for the survival of the species.

267
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,250
Huh?

268
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,840
Never mind,um... we found this,uh... locket
on Carlie's remains,

269
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,920
it says,uh,"I love you,Kenny."
Did she ever mention a Kenny?

270
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,720
Yes.
She talked about Kenny all the time.

271
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,110
He's never mentioned in the police report.

272
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,100
Kenny was her dog.

273
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,150
Her dog?

274
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,760
Kyle bought her the dog when things we better between them.
She loved that dog.

275
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,470
There used to be
a picture of the two of them in there.

276
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,120
Oh,where is her dog now?

277
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,600
It died. Mary took care of it.

278
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,980
I'm a vet; they brought it in...

279
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,910
a few months before Carlie disappeared.

280
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,350
Kyle said he backed over it accidentally.

281
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,000
rlie always felt he did it on purpose.

282
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,730
He was a real piece of work when he got mad.

283
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,180
A dead dog? Excellent.

284
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,600
So,we're back to one suspect: Richardson.

285
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,550
I like this. Good work.

286
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,270
Do you want children?

287
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,910
- What?
- Children?

288
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,800
Maybe,if I could
find one that sleeps late and cleans.

289
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,510
Does this apply to the case in any way?

290
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,130
No,just curious.

291
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,120
Most people think it's odd when a woman doesn't want children,

292
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,670
but,obviously,you don't.

293
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,940
Are you pregnant?

294
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,060
No... I'm not.

295
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,510
Why are you looking at me?

296
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,230
Well,as long as you're
not leaving the lab every two minutes to pee.

297
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,320
No intention of it.

298
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,550
So all this back and forth was for nothing.

299
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,850
Good to know.

300
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,040
Now,unless the liver has
a written confession in it by a pet parakeet,

301
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,070
we should have enough to build a solid forensic case
against Richardson for the prosecutor.

302
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,010
I found something that might put a new
wrinkle in things.

303
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,230
Great.

304
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,330
Oh,God.

305
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,510
The fish was a Pomatomus  saltatrix,a bluefish,
common to Delaware Bay.

306
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:22,160
And there were dinoflagellates consistent
with the saltwater in the bay.

307
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,330
Dozing off,Hodge-podge.

308
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:28,300
But I also found didinium,a ciliate,and oomycota,

309
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,200
a mold,both of which are found
in freshwater.

310
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,030
So,the body was in fresh
and salt water.

311
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,270
Exactly.Freshwater first for at least six months.

312
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:41,480
Okay,now we have witnesses that put Richardson
at the marina that night; there is no freshwater

313
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,250
**********

314
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,320
what's going on here?

315
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,240
Richardson is the only logical suspect.
Are we working for the defense now?

316
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,770
I'm working for the victims and we have to be open
to the evidence as it presents itself.

317
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,700
The knife,the rope,the plastic sheeting are all
from Richardson's house,that's been confirmed.

318
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,380
We're trying to build a case here,people.

319
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,260
We don't ignore facts just because they might
change the outcome of a case.

320
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,710
Not asking you to,Doc,
I just want you to fill in the blanks.

321
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,560
There must be freshwater close enough
for Richardson to have dumped the body.

322
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,840
It has to have the same sediment,larvae,
archaea,helminths...

323
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,190
Great.Whatever the hel- minths those are find them.

324
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,720
And if we find a body of water that matches,
it has to be dredged for additional body parts.

325
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,370
We're still missing the left patella,tibia and calcaneus.

326
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,970
- And the fetus is missing the...
- Okay,fine.

327
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,940
Just stop talking and do it.

328
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,530
Hey,so... is this the only freshwater near the bay?

329
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:38,170
The only body of water that might have
algae and sediment that could match what we found on the remains.

330
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,510
Whoo! Seems to be a lot of gamophyta.

331
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,370
Is that good?

332
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,390
I won't know until I compare it to the samples in the lab.

333
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,840
Then why'd you act so excited?

334
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,500
I guess I just like gamophyta.

335
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,890
You know,you really don't have to act any geekier.

336
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,860
The whole outfit does it for you.

337
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,410
Geek chic,dude.

338
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,820
Agent Blondie over there thinks I'm hot.

339
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,400
How ya doing?

340
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,300
Anything?

341
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,220
Another Top-Flite.

342
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,590
You know,I went out with a woman
who had a little kid once.

343
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,390
Aren't you supposed to be looking for slime?

344
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,980
The kid hated me,you know,he said I used too many big words.

345
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,950
- Well,he got that right.
- He hit me in the head with a Tonka truck.

346
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,760
I could never sleep with his mom again.

347
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,380
Well,you know,at least the story ends well.

348
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,860
I was good to him,though,you know? I mean,I did not deserve
an 18-wheeler to the parietal bone.

349
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,560
Ooh,nematodes and planaria.

350
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,120
Does that mean anything?

351
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,040
Not sure.

352
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,210
Anything?

353
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,850
Bones. Could be from the fetus.

354
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,020
Hamate,triquetral,
portions of the phalanges

355
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,960
and another Top-Flite.

356
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,940
According to the reconstruction with these new bones,
the fetus has seven fingers.

357
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,910
And two right hands.

358
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,180
I don't understand. Was there another victim?

359
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,800
Double the magnification.

360
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,880
Look at the structure of the phalanges.

361
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,360
the bones from the lake are from a raccoon.

362
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,300
the formation of the hands
is almost identical to an infant's hand.

363
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,390
How did you do?

364
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,270
We found a raccoon,you?

365
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,770
The sediment and organic material from the lake
doesn't match what was taken from the remains.

366
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,580
I have to look for another body of freshwater.
I don't think it's around here.

367
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,890
What have you got?

368
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,610
Nothing.

369
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:30,040
And the next body
of freshwater that might be a match is over 60 miles away.

370
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,160
Richardson couldn't have been there.
It wouldn't match the timeline.

371
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,810
I've got the board of the Jeffersonian,the federal prosecutor

372
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:39,470
and Nancy Grace ready to devour me
if I don't hand them enough to indict Richardson.

373
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,290
Well,if you want us to manufacture evidence...

374
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,750
No,I want us to find out who killed Carlie,and I'm pissed

375
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,560
'cause whoever did it is messing with me and I don't like that.

376
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,360
I like doing the messing.

377
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,250
Then we have to determine
whether we're wasting our time on Richardson.

378
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,560
Tell me what you need.

379
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,340
His plates were found in a ditch on Route 432.

380
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,700
His car in a vacant lot in Huntsville.

381
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,480
He could be using another car or he could be hiding out.

382
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,750
Can anybody I.D. him?

383
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,900
I've got I.D.s coming in from all over the place.

384
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,490
This is where the concerned citizens
all come out for the reward.

385
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,220
Excuse us,Agent Booth?

386
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,220
- Let me know if you find something.
- Sure.

387
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm Dennis Campbell. This is my wife,Patricia.

388
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,090
- We're Carlie's parents.
- Yes,I know. Please... sit down.

389
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,560
I'm so sorry for your loss.

390
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,300
Well,at least now our daughter
can rest with her baby and Kyle can never touch them again.

391
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,510
The reason we're here...

392
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,700
We were going through some photos
for the funeral and...

393
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,920
we came across this one.

394
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,010
Kyle used to go out of town on business.

395
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,400
His firm had an office in Boston.

396
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,080
Carlie went with him once.

397
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,120
This is them with some people in Boston.

398
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,480
That woman on the news,Karen Tyler,

399
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,120
she said she met Kyle  after Carlie disappeared,

400
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,850
but here she is looking at him.

401
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,620
He admitted to being involved with those other girls.

402
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,900
Why did he lie about knowing her?

403
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,960
- May I keep this photo?
- Of course.

404
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,720
We need em to answer for this.

405
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,700
She was our little girl.

406
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,730
She wasn't supposed to go before us.

407
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,740
That's not the way it's supposed to be.

408
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,570
I know. We'll find Kyle.

409
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,590
I promise.

410
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,430
You want me to what?

411
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,990
Stab the body for me.

412
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,500
We need match force
with the injuries recorded on the remains.

413
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,810
Okay,I'm stabbing the body.

414
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,540
Well... it's a replica.

415
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,670
We're all going to do it,you're just the closest
to Kyle Richardson.

416
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,970
Okay,you know what,that's great.

417
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,040
I'll be there in 20,but in the future
you just have to ask me differently,Bones,

418
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,840
because you know what,come over to your place
to stab a body,that is just freaky.

419
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,260
Seeley,you son of a bitch.

420
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,520
Oh... I,uh,Rebecca,wow,you look great.

421
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,740
Yeah,okay,save it,'cause I need a lot more
than compliments from you right now.

422
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,960
Okay,just keep it down for a little bit,you know,
'cause I'm at work,all right?

423
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,880
You sent agents to investigate Drew

424
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,310
because you're going to stop that now.

425
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,790
Okay,listen,I'm just being cautious.

426
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,030
What do you really know about this guy anyway,huh?

427
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,800
I know...I-I-I know that he has a good job.

428
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,820
And I-I know that he fixes stuff around the house
when he says he's going to.

429
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,770
And I know that Parker is crazy about him

430
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:16,480
and he's not terrified every time he goes off to work
that he's going to get shot and I know that I love him.

431
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,690
I love him.

432
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,210
And now everyone at work thinks he's a criminal.

433
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,810
Well,he's been spotted with explosives.

434
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,800
He is a construction foreman,He does demolition,

435
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,950
I mean,you must've figured that out
when you were doing all of your snooping.

436
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,290
Look,I have a right to know who's hanging around my son.

437
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,100
All right,he spends more time with Parker than I do.

438
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,310
Okay,you think that I would put Parker in danger?

439
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:38,720
Let me ask you a question,Rebecca.
Why is it that you keep all the men in your life such a secret?

440
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,700
Because you always interrogate them or intimidate them
and it freaks them out.

441
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,540
Well,I mean,come on,a lot of them are a little strange,I mean,
the guy with the tattoos on his neck.

442
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,690
Hold on,I don't even have to let you see Parker,
okay,not-not legally.

443
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,110
That's one of the upsides of not being married.

444
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,460
Don't.

445
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,480
I'm a good father.
You know that.

446
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,780
You have got to stop trying to run things.

447
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,360
I've got things in my life that have nothing to do with you.

448
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,700
All right,look. You know what?
We are always going to have something to do with each other

449
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,740
because we share a son.

450
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,170
Drew's a good man,and you need to back off,

451
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,800
or you're not going to see Parker again,I swear.

452
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,700
You back off.

453
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,630
Here comes Kyle.

454
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,230
Ha,ha,funny.
Don't we have something to stab?

455
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,340
This. I hate my job.

456
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,860
From the depth of the stab wounds,

457
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,750
we can tell the approximate force required
in newton meters to inflict the marks we see on the bones.

458
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:47,630
So,we have to measure the amount of force
generated when we stab to give us the the size,

459
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,830
weight,and body type of the assailant.

460
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,980
You had to dress her up.

461
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,270
The clothes she wore figure in the resistance to the blows.

462
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,700
The knife is consistent with the one
that caused the wounds.

463
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,960
We fitted it with an instrument and blade

464
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,310
that will give us a digital readout
of the newton meters of each stab.

465
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,550
It's a dual mass drop system.

466
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,220
All I hear is blah,blah,blah.

467
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,520
Cliff Note's version--
we all stab,one of us is the killer.

468
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,940
Thank you. Sort of like a real creepy party game.

469
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,000
The violence of the attack shows rage,

470
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,890
so everyone should stab as hard as they can.

471
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,130
This better work!

472
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,220
That was weird.

473
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,200
Okay,okay.

474
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,560
Results?

475
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,030
The force used to make the injuries on the bones

476
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,950
was 24 newton meters.

477
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,280
And the winner is,

478
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,520
with 24 newton meters...

479
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,990
Angela.

480
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,240
What?

481
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,710
Congratulations.

482
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,830
Really?

483
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,130
Height and weight?

484
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,510
Oh,God.
Uh,uh...

485
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,720
Five,eight,one hundred and..

486
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,370
- What?
- 135.

487
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,720
It's all muscle.

488
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,430
Karen Tyler is

489
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,680
five-seven and 132 pounds.

490
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,990
So,Kyle's girlfriend kills Carlie so they can be together?

491
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,130
Well,then,why did Kyle run?

492
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,100
Maybe he didn't.
It sounds nuts but

493
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:31,150
if she's the killer,maybe Karen got rid of him,*********

494
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,140
you're sure that there's no way
Richardson could have made these wounds?

495
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,060
With his strength,
the blows would have sliced deeper into the bone.

496
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,970
Well,these seemed to go right through.

497
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,430
Well,those were delivered after she was on the ground.

498
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,500
So,Karen does the killing
because they know everyone will be suspecting Kyle.

499
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,950
I'd prefer not to make any more assumptions.

500
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,510
There are particles in the knife marks.

501
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,190
When she was on the ground,
the knife passed through the body

502
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,910
and picked up sediment from the dirt.

503
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,360
The next stab imbedded that into the bone.

504
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,580
If I can get enough information from these particulates,

505
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,400
I might be able to locate the site of the murder.

506
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,010
DNA results came back. It was Kyle under her nails.

507
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,160
So he was there,too?

508
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,410
Maybe.But we know he had a fight
with her earlier that he admits.

509
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:17,130
Fortunately,there was also the skin of somebody else.

510
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,880
Test showed it was a woman.

511
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,420
Hmm. Karen Tyler.

512
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,400
We should get her DNA drawn
as soon as possible.

513
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,150
Smart. Let's go.

514
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,860
I didn't do it.
I swear,I would never hurt her.

515
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,110
Hmm. And the other day,you said you and Kyle
didn't know each other until after Carlie disappeared.

516
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,360
Because we both knew what everyone would think.

517
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,650
Karen,please don't say anything.

518
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,710
Mm,even your lawyer thinks you did it.

519
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,350
Kyle thought we should separate and meet up
in a few months,so,

520
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,930
you know,it wouldn't look so bad.

521
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,420
Well,that didn't work out,now,did it?

522
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,900
Open your mouth.

523
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,740
Do I really have to do this?

524
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,290
They have a warrant.

525
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:54,770
When you were sleeping with Kyle,
didn't it matter to you that you're destroying a family?

526
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,310
We were in love.

527
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,910
Oh. Love.
Sorry. Now it's a beautiful story.

528
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,600
Open again.

529
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,520
Ouch!

530
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,620
Oops.

531
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,630
Kyle was going to tell her.
We were going to be honest.

532
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,520
Mm,'cause you know you do that so well.

533
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,400
I would never hurt her.

534
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,730
And neither would Kyle.

535
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,790
Kyle.

536
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:18,370
Right,the love of your life
who no one has seen for two days.

537
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,950
Can you see why
I'm leery of relationships?

538
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,040
We hit paydirt.

539
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,700
Actually,we hit silt containing the feces
of the gypsy moth,some quartz,and mica.

540
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,480
That and the zinc levels in the dinoflagellates from
the freshwater as well as the Pinaceae pollen

541
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,580
led us to a patch of pitch pines
outside of Gloucester City,New Jersey.

542
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,140
She was killed right here.

543
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,980
And when did they move her to the bay?

544
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,520
They didn't.
They left her in New Jersey.

545
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,630
In the Rancocas Creek.
She made it to the bay on her own.

546
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,610
- Oh,what,she take the shuttle?
- Basically.

547
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:56,650
Two days after Carlie disappeared,
there were thunderstorms in Central New Jersey.

548
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,300
Heavy,heavy rains.

549
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,430
The body must have been flushed down
the Rancocas and into the Delaware River.

550
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,800
Th,she slowly made her way down the Delaware
and into the bay.

551
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,080
The movement
and the battering on the rocks loosened her weight,

552
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,620
so she floated to the surface and washed ashore.

553
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,240
I'm pretty sure Karen didn't see that coming,hmm?

554
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,710
Now you're sure this is it?

555
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,450
Zinc,mica,feces-- this is the place.

556
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,290
Uh,it's beautiful here.

557
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,290
Yeah,because,you know,that's important for a murder.

558
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,290
Okay,the bodies were wrapped on the bank of the river.

559
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,330
Sift the soil for the missing bones.

560
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,040
Agent Booth?

561
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,090
Over here.

562
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,750
Look at that-- "C.R."

563
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,840
Carlie Richardson's initials.

564
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:05,720
You don't pack face cream and a nightgown
if you're being abducted.

565
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,140
Lot of vacation cabins nearby.

566
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,410
If she was upset,this would be a good place
to unwind.

567
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:11,880
Oh,Karen Tyler said that she liked Carlie.

568
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,080
She could have befriended her to lure her up here.

569
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,740
Maybe Carlie's friends
knew that she and Karen...

570
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,290
were getting chummy.

571
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,380
Did Carlie know about her?

572
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,040
I thought they just  started going out.

573
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,540
No. They knew each other from before.

574
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,930
That bastard.

575
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:32,490
Carlie knew Kyle was cheating on her.
That's why they were fighting.

576
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,980
And why she didn't want the baby.

577
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,270
- Did she say that?
- I don't care what's happening.

578
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:40,180
To say that you don't want your child
when you're getting ready to give birth--

579
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,810
it's not right.

580
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,530
I think I did see this woman.

581
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,520
I was driving home from work.
They were in front of a Starbucks.

582
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,870
I'm not sure if it was the day she disappeared,
but I'm pretty sure it was around the same time.

583
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,680
Thanks.

584
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,250
Your kid's eating sand.

585
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,580
I don't know how they can do it.

586
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,970
Self-obsessed. They have no conscience.

587
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:05,860
I don't know.

588
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,450
They destroy anything that gets in their way.
They're not even human.

589
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,280
- The mothers?
- Huh?

590
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,740
Well,I was talking about the mothers.

591
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,340
I'm talking about the killers.

592
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,710
I understand killers.

593
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,110
I just don't know how mothers can do it.

594
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,670
I mean,dogs can be trained in a couple weeks.

595
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,660
With kids,mothers have
to give up their lives for years.

596
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,240
I don't know. When you're looking at your kid,
you don't even feel like you're giving up anything.

597
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,080
- So you'd do it again?
- What?

598
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,930
You'd have Parker even with everything you're going through.

599
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,230
What kind of question is that?

600
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,280
Wouldn't it be easier if Parker wasn't caught in

601
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,700
this drama of yours with Rebecca,the new boyfriend?

602
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,140
God,no,no. Bones,he's my son.

603
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,940
Whatever we're going through,
it's-it's not about that. He knows that.

604
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,890
That's what parents say
when they want to justify themselves.

605
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,120
You know,I haven't walked out on Parker,all right?

606
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,870
I would never have done what your parents did.

607
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,750
Well,I didn't say you would.
I just...

608
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,130
I don't know.

609
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,660
You're the father.
I don't know anything about raising kids,so...

610
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,790
Parker's fine.

611
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,760
- It's not Karen Tyler.
- What?

612
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,480
The DNA from under Carlie's fingernails doesn't match.

613
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,600
And something else is weird.

614
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,890
Tissue from the fetus shows evidence
of escitalopram.

615
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:14,630
What's that?

616
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,370
It's a drug prescribed for depression.

617
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,400
It's not weird.

618
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,150
Carlie Richardson was having emotional problems
with her husband.

619
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,000
Carlie Richardson wasn't taking the drug.

620
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,760
Hold on. None of this is making any sense.

621
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,910
I agree.

622
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,380
The only way the fetus could have the drug
in its system is if it were passed from the mother in utero.

623
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,280
Or through breast milk.

624
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,020
How do you breast-feed an unborn child?

625
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,180
Zack?

626
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:39,930
An infant skull is made up of several separate bones

627
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,730
that are... eventually fuse together.

628
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,790
Look at the molding here.

629
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,190
Oh,my God.

630
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,690
I don't believe it.

631
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,900
Yeah.

632
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,930
Okay. Now everybody knows but me.

633
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,870
This is not a fetus.

634
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,940
The skull bones have shifted and overlapped

635
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,330
because this child passed through the birth canal.

636
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,330
This baby was born alive

637
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:04,280
and lived about two weeks.

638
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,650
But Carlie was pregnant when she was last seen.

639
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,210
This isn't Carlie Richardson's child.

640
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,190
The escitalopram in its system
came from breast milk.

641
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,010
Then what happened to her baby?

642
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,540
The baby was
cut out of her and stolen.

643
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,430
This child replaced it.

644
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:29,780
This child was dead before Carlie was murdered.

645
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,400
You can see the traces of blood pooling in the cranium.

646
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,160
Abusive head trauma.

647
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,100
Evidence of shaken baby syndrome.

648
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,470
Oh,God.

649
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:40,220
You said the little guy was only
two weeks old.

650
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,980
Whoever the mother was was probably
taking the mediation for postpartum depression.

651
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,890
She got upset with the baby--

652
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:47,670
crying's the most common cause--

653
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,560
and she shook him to quiet him down.

654
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,540
It can take as little as five seconds
for an infant to die by shaking.

655
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,380
Five seconds?

656
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,120
The veins that attach the brain to
the inside of the skull detach.

657
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,240
Blood pools,the brain swells...

658
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,760
Okay,I get it.

659
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,380
All right,so what you're saying is
that the mother kills her own son

660
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,520
and replaces him with Carlie's.

661
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,180
Fits the pattern-- she feels the guilt
about what she's done and needs to make it right,

662
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,510
prove to herself
that she's still a good mother,

663
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,170
so she takes Carlie's child
and makes it her own.

664
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,950
It's only been two weeks.
Not many people have seen her kid.

665
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,920
- Who would know?
- Yeah,but the stab wous?

666
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,140
All of Carlie's stab wounds
are to the upper part of the body.

667
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,160
The killer was careful not to hit close to the uterus

668
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,110
because she wanted the baby alive.

669
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,260
Your report indicas there were
knife marks on the lower ribs.

670
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,420
They seem to be made by whatever

671
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,960
instrument was used to remove the child
after Carlie was dead.

672
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,840
Yup. I'm working on identifying it.

673
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,820
We might be able to use the child's most prominent

674
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:49,620
genetic characteristics
to see similarities with the mother.

675
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,610
Ange,

676
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,350
can you input the information
from the infant's skull to give us a face?

677
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,800
Sure.

678
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:58,940
Booth.

679
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,160
Yeah. Right away.

680
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,960
They've found Kyle Richardson.

681
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,370
Got to wonder if he even cared,

682
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,170
you know,finding out that his wife is dead.

683
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,240
- He didn't kill her.
- No,but he ran.

684
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,310
How do you just cut your family
out of your life like that?

685
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,650
Well,what about Abraham?

686
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,830
Oh,you're going to throw religion
in my face right now?

687
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,020
I thought you found answers in what you believe.

688
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,330
I mean,that's just one Bible story that I just don't like.

689
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:25,850
I mean,God commands Abraham
to kill his own son,and he does.

690
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,550
No,Abraham does not kill Isaac.

691
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:29,580
But old Abe,you know,he had theintention.

692
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,000
I thought what he had was faith.

693
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,580
Look,I have faith,but if God himself came down,

694
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,170
pointed at Parker and said,
"I want you to..."

695
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,660
You know? That ain't gonna happen.

696
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,640
Well,God's messenger stopped Abraham?

697
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,300
Yeah. You know,grabbed his hand at the last second,

698
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,200
right before the knife was about to go in.

699
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,100
Okay,then the lesson I would learn from this myth...

700
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,040
Myth?

701
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,010
- Well,it fits the definition.
- Okay,fine.

702
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:54,410
That when it comes to your children,
your love has to be absolute.

703
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:58,080
The messenger represents goodness,
what you know to be right.

704
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,880
Ergo,you have to remain open
to what you know is true.

705
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,760
Are you sure you're not religious?

706
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,120
Science all the way.

707
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,880
Science all the way.

708
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,920
Hey,even an empiricist can have a heart,Booth.

709
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,620
Too bad Richardson doesn't.

710
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,830
Just lock me up.
I can't go through this anymore.

711
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,600
We know you didn't do it.

712
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,580
What?

713
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,070
Evidence doesn't fit you.

714
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,130
Then who was it? Who killed him?

715
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,670
You ran. Seems like you'd be the one who'd know.

716
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,140
I would have told someone if I knew.

717
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,240
Right,'cause,you know,you're such an honorable guy.

718
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,290
The knife,the rope,the sheeting--
it all came from your place,

719
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,360
and why didn't you tell the police it was missing?

720
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,920
Oh. What,you check out what's in your garage every day?

721
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,350
If you didn't know anything,why'd you take off?

722
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,330
Because I'm a bastard.

723
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,510
I'm a selfish,pathetic bastard,

724
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,990
and everyone had already decided
that I was guilty.

725
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,850
- That's true,Booth.
- Bones.

726
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,960
No wanted to find another suspect.

727
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,590
I kept on insisting.

728
00:34:58,770 --> 00:34:59,760
Thank you.

729
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,510
I didn't do it for you.

730
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,570
You are a pathetic bastard.

731
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,660
Your wife was having your baby.

732
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:09,390
Look,I did want to leave her,yeah.

733
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,510
I was out that night,
trying to figure out how to tell her.

734
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,600
What with the baby and everything.

735
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,340
But for God sake,
I didn't want them to die.

736
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,260
So,you have no idea who did this?

737
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,100
I should,shouldn't I?

738
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,660
I mean,

739
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,400
I ignored her for so long.

740
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,800
It's like this whole thing is my fault anyway.

741
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,780
You know,if I had been there that night,

742
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,870
maybe they'd still be here.

743
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,190
We think your child might still be alive.

744
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,810
I-I don't understand.
The bodies you found?

745
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,730
That wasn't your child.

746
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,390
Whoever killed Carlie took your child
and left theirs.

747
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,070
Oh,my God.

748
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,500
So,where's my kid?

749
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,080
We don't know.

750
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,390
Zack is working
on the other knife mark.

751
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,860
I saw some staining in the groove it left,
so I did some tests.

752
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,410
The stain is from Betadine.

753
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,640
It's an antiseptic used to prep patients for surgery.

754
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,330
Oh,someone was being really careful
when they were cutting her up.

755
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,220
It was the baby they were concerned with.

756
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,910
Were you able to get enough detail from
the skull for a digital reconstruction?

757
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:32,300
Yeah. Since someone this young is still being formed,

758
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,350
the,uh,features are generalized.

759
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,440
The last place I worked had a drunk sketch artist.

760
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,210
Wow.

761
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,010
It's a baby.
It looks like every baby.

762
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:48,670
That's why I ran the reconstruction
through an aging matrix.

763
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,430
It posits the most likely growth pattern
the skull would follow.

764
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,720
Now,as it ages,
the features become more distinct.

765
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,110
By the time he's about ten,

766
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:01,180
he shows very definite genetic characteristics.

767
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,630
Robby!

768
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,150
Don't eat that,honey.

769
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,680
Hey,there you go.
There you go,there you go!

770
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,210
The mark on the ribs was from a scalpel.

771
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,180
The woman is a vet,so she has medical training,

772
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,930
which also explains the Betadine.

773
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:27,270
Look at her,huh? Playing with the kid.

774
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,270
Okay.

775
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,570
Miss Corbus?

776
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,870
I'm gonna have to ask you to hand us the child.

777
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,100
What? Why?

778
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,510
I think you know why.

779
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,010
No. You want me to give you my son? No.

780
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,680
He's not your son.

781
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,880
We know what happened.

782
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,590
He is. Robby is my son.

783
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:47,710
We have a warrant to take a DNA sample
from you,Miss Corbus.

784
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,420
It'd be pretty hard to argue with that.

785
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,520
She didn't want him.

786
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,300
She told me she wished she had never gotten pregnant.

787
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,500
It was wrong for her to have him.

788
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,100
And killing your own child wasn't wrong?

789
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,710
That was a mistake. I am a single mother.

790
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,980
I'm alone. I just... I just wanted him to stop crying.

791
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,340
It was just... it was just a few seconds.

792
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,570
The doctor said I was sick,but I'm all better now.

793
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,920
I know,sweetie.

794
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,010
Miss Corbus?

795
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,850
You can't take him from me. I'm a good mother.

796
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,090
You can ask anybody. I'm a good mother.

797
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,120
Give us the child.

798
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,690
I'm a good mother.

799
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,890
Mary Corbus,you're under arrest for the
murder and kidnapping of Carlie Richardson

800
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,960
and the murder of your son Robert Corbus.

801
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,200
No,that's my Robbie,that's my Robbie.

802
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,090
Oh,my God!

803
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,620
I'm a good mother. I'm a good mother.

804
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,010
He's fine?

805
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,340
He's perfect.

806
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,870
- And you're sure...
- He's yours.

807
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,250
When I thought he was gone,

808
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,880
and Carlie

809
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,300
I wished
I could have changed how things had been.

810
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,810
Don't you want to hold him?

811
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,880
I don't know,um...

812
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,840
the kind of guy I am...

813
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,450
I'm no father.

814
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,430
You don't get to decide that.

815
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,530
You have a son.

816
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,390
Step up.
Take him.

817
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,110
Hey.

818
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,350
Thank you.

819
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,150
Thank you.

820
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,210
So you think Richardson can rise to the occasion?

821
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,280
Be a decent father?

822
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,460
He's got Carlie's parents to help him

823
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,520
and I like to think that people can change.

824
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,940
Faith and hope,right?

825
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,950
Right.

826
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,870
Ange will throw in love,too.

827
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,530
Love is good.

828
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,940
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

829
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,890
- Parker!
- Look what I did!

830
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:39,770
Wow,look at that.

831
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,290
Um,listen,you stay here with Dr. Brennan,okay?

832
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:47,140
I'm going to go talk to your mommy,all right?

833
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,580
all right?

834
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,120
So this is how it's got to go down.

835
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,480
I've got to meet your boyfriend with Parker here.

836
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,950
Look,man,we're here because we want...

837
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,670
I'm talking to Rebecca.

838
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,510
Look,this was Drew's idea.

839
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,720
And,you know,I told him
it was going to be a bad one.

840
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,770
- Dad,look.
- One second,bud.

841
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,530
Parker wanted you to see what he made for school.

842
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,640
And he kept saying how much he wanted us to meet.

843
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,700
And we'd be friends.

844
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,710
Look,I got a kid
I don't get to see much myself.

845
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,790
I know what it's like.

846
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,790
And I swear,
the explosives were for work.

847
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,230
Booth.

848
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,910
Okay,look,look,look,look.

849
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,880
We are what we are.

850
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,720
And you can fight it if you want,
but you're just going to fight with yourself.

851
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,590
Maybe this isn't a good time.

852
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,920
Maybe later.

853
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:46,130
No,no,it's a good time.

854
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,540
Let me buy you a cup of coffee,all right?

855
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,690
- Let's go grab a seat.
- Seriously?

856
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,110
Thanks,man.

857
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:56,190
That's okay,Bones,you can stay.

858
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,060
It's a family thing.

859
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,030
Bye,Parker.

860
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,450
- Bye.
- Bye.

861
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,480
All right,what do we got here,huh?

862
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:05,790
A diorama.

863
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,300
It's the zoo. Drew helped me.

864
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,950
The zoo? I hoped you thanked him.

865
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:11,370
He did. Yes,he did.

866
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,380
We gotta go to the zoo.

867
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,940
He knows all the animals.

868
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,460
All the animals?

869
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:20,340
Wow. Okay,well,maybe afterwards
we could all go out to dinner

870
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,250
if that's okay with your mom.

871
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,800
Yeah,that sounds good.

872
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:29,000
My dad knows a burger place.

873
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:31,280
I used to take him there after his T-ball games.

874
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,170
Tell Drew about the burgers.

875
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,650
He says they're as big  as my head.

876
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,310
As big as your head.  We can all go.

877
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:37,950
We can even bring Stu...
