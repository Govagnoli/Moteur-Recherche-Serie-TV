1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,236
- Name?
- You know my name.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,838
You are making a request to the FBI to carry a
concealed weapon. I have to follow protocol.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,674
- It's ridiculous.
- Fine. We're done. Do you want to get coffee?

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,228
My name is Dr Temperance Brennan.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,676
- Reason for wanting a gun.
- To shoot people. It's the truth.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,312
You know, I'm writing, "Self-defence
in the performance of my duties

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,914
pursuing suspected felons

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,992
as contracted out to the FBI."

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,232
- So I can shoot them.
- Ever been charged with a felony?

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,436
- Charged or convicted?
- Charged.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,715
- You know I have.
- I have to ask.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,271
- Bureaucratic nonsense.
- Nevertheless, name of the arresting officer?

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,316
You.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,233
Special Agent Seeley Booth.
You need me to spell that?

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,517
- I can sound that out.
- So when do I get the gun?

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,430
- You can't have a gun.
- Why not?

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,910
- You were charged with a felony.
- Write down that you were wrong.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,788
- Oh, there's no space for that.
- Then why'd we go through all this?

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,795
You have a constitutional right to apply
for a weapon. I would never deny your right.

20
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,792
- I need a gun.
- Rules are rules.

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,839
Tell them that I shot a murderer
who was going to light me on fire.

22
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,629
Which is why you werert convicted,
but you did shoot an unarmed man.

23
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,555
I can't ignore that. I swore an oath to protect
society from people who shoot people.

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,997
It was only his leg, and he's in jail for life.
How much is he gonna use it anyway?

25
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,356
- You have the right to an appeal.
- To whom?

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,792
Cullen?

27
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,795
- I'm pretty sure he doesn't like me.
- Yeah. I'm pretty sure you're right.

28
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,949
Bones, you don't need a gun.
If anyone needs shooting, I'll do it.

29
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,068
What if you're injured or dead? I'm not hoping
it'll happen, I'm just stating a possibility.

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,756
Come on. You know what, Bones? You're
a professor. You're not an FBI agent, OK?

31
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,674
Use your mutant powers.
Just talk people to death.

32
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,593
- Am I interrupting?
- I told them not to let you in.

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,958
- I gave them your picture.
- Which is why I wore the tiny skirt.

34
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,110
Very cute.

35
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,836
- Amy Morton.
- Temperance Brennan.

36
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,639
- You work with him?
- I'm a forensic anthropologist.

37
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,915
I'm a defence lawyer. I work against him.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,958
If it's all the same,
I'd prefer you two didn't bond.

39
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,669
I want to get back. You said
I could fill out gun reapplication forms.

40
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,194
Send it back by courier. No hurry.

41
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,350
Nice to meet you.

42
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,595
- What do you want?
- Remember Howard Epps?

43
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,275
- Not likely to forget him.
- He's scheduled to be executed tomorrow.

44
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,238
- My job is to keep that from happening.
- Best of luck.

45
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,348
He deserves five minutes of consideration
from the man who put him on death row.

46
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,796
I arrested Howard Epps.
It was the jury who sentenced him to die.

47
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,795
They found a pubic hair on the victim at the
scene. They never figured out whose it was.

48
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,873
Blame the judge who disallowed it
as evidence and the judge on the appeal.

49
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,555
- Epps was not well-represented.
- How long have you been on the case?

50
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,313
- Almost a week.
- Less than a week, huh?

51
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,679
Two judges, two juries, two prosecutors that
find Epps guilty, but it's me you come after.

52
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,073
I'm asking, are you absolutely positive
Howard Epps killed that girl?

53
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,355
Yeah. I am absolutely positive.

54
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,999
The judges should've allowed the juries
to hear that that victim was with another man.

55
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,072
- He still would've been convicted.
- Not if I'd been there.

56
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,435
- You werert.
- I am now.

57
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,955
When was the last time
you looked him in the face?

58
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,350
Cos you're a lot smarter
than you were seven years ago.

59
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,795
A lot less angry.

60
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,668
You might wanna check out
the evidence again.

61
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,955
I'd ask how you were doing, Howard,
but I guess we both know the answer.

62
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,679
Agent Booth.

63
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,799
- Did you come to apologise?
- I'm not the one who beat a girl to death.

64
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,112
Your attorney wants me
to look you in the face.

65
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,431
- Why?
- She thinks you're innocent.

66
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,795
She's right about that.

67
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,030
I didn't kill anybody,

68
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,271
unlike you, the sniper.

69
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,230
The girl who got murdered was smart.

70
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,233
She was pretty. She was from a good family.

71
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,993
Someone has to die for that,

72
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,435
and I'm all they got.

73
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,592
OK. I looked you in the face.

74
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,240
I read it can be hell.

75
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,834
They say it's like going to sleep,

76
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,753
but you're on fire.

77
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,799
And you're paralysed so you can't scream.

78
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,158
I mean, that's all you got sometimes,
you know?

79
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,515
The scream.

80
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,876
- What if they get mixed up?
- I can tell them apart. Jeff and OIlie. I win.

81
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,557
- What do you...? What? That one was mine.
- You had Jeff. OIlie won. You owe me a buck.

82
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,509
- You want in on the action, Angela?
- No, thank you. I'm going to go have sex.

83
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,909
- Have a good time.
- OK.

84
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,433
You sure you don't want to come?
Troy can call a friend.

85
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,469
I've been waiting months for these. It's
a partial skeleton from France. The Institute...

86
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,476
You know, the whole point of the week is the
weekend. This is not the cabaret, my friend.

87
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,596
Life is the cabaret.

88
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,069
Come to the cabaret.

89
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,319
It's like describing the moon to a mole.

90
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,918
- I demand another beetle. He has a groin pull.
- Arthropods do not possess groins. Pay up.

91
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,751
- Angela, looking good.
- And don't I know it?

92
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,068
<i>(whistles)</i>

93
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,276
OK, our tax dollars hard at work.

94
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,113
What's break time at the FBI?
Book burning? Oh, God!

95
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,997
What are you doing this weekend?

96
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,877
- I have plans.
- I'm serious.

97
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,032
Between your girlfriend the lawyer
and the defence lawyer,

98
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,315
your weekend must be booked.

99
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,550
What is your thing with lawyers?

100
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,475
Look, seven years ago a 17-year-old, April
Wright, was beaten to death in a federal park.

101
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,393
Amy's trying to stop
the guy who did it being executed.

102
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,075
- We're not pursuing your lawyer obsession?
- Amy doesn't think he did it.

103
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,075
- And what does this have to do with you?
- Oh, if Amy doesn't turn over every stone...

104
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,436
And you're one of her stones?

105
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,909
- Do you think he did it?
- Yes.

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,993
- What's her reasoning?
- A pubic hair that wasrt accounted for.

107
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,355
Sounds like ajob for the FBI crime lab.

108
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,557
It's a weekend deal. Off the books.
But if you have plans...

109
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,790
Wait.

110
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,112
- This is a personal favour you're asking.
- Not for me, for Amy.

111
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,275
Well, your personal favour would be for Amy,
but mine would be for you, strictly speaking.

112
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,557
Please do me a favour.

113
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,790
Please?

114
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:34,276
- <i>(Bones)</i> Any remains withheld from burial?
- Not after the last appeal.

115
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,308
I'd need X-rays from the ME and the coroner.
Originals. The copies are useless.

116
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,712
- Bone scrapings, lab results, tox screens.
- The evidence will be here in an hour.

117
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,190
I'll ask the others. I won't order them.
They might have plans.

118
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,909
It's Friday night and they're racing beetles.

119
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,275
How much time do we have?

120
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,990
Howard Epps will be executed
in 30 hours and 23 minutes.

121
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,312
Let's start. Zack, pull up the first X-ray.

122
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,756
- Stress fractures on both tibias.
- What's that mean?

123
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,197
- An old injury from dance or running.
- She was a cheerleader.

124
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:49,593
The Chinese executed people by cutting flesh
off them. Called it the death of 1,000 cuts.

125
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,356
- Fractured trapezium, scaphoid and radius.
- What's that mean?

126
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,069
When she was being beaten,
she threw her arm up to defend herself.

127
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,833
That's consistent with the autopsy report.

128
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,959
In medieval Scotland, they'd tie
a convict's arms and legs to bent saplings.

129
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,070
When they released the saplings, the trees
sprang apart and the felon was torn in half.

130
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,913
- Should I grab particulates?
- That's clean.

131
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,949
It's a phone number we found on the girl for
an old woman with no connection to anyone.

132
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,271
Extensive damage to the skull,
smashed six to eight times

133
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,555
with a narrow cylindrical object.

134
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,918
- The tyre iron was missing from April's car.
- She'd had sex shortly before death.

135
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,152
- Consensual. No assault.
- The hair was never matched to anyone?

136
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,199
No. The prosecution got it excluded
from evidence in trial and on appeal.

137
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,512
That's the basis of your lawyer's
last-ditch attempt to stop the execution?

138
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,433
Yeah. And whatever else you guys can find.

139
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,872
There are particles lodged
between the left triquetral and the capitate.

140
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,997
The ME found they were bone fragments
dislodged by the tyre iron.

141
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,868
- No. These shadows are too opaque for bone.
- What's that mean?

142
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,350
The prosecutiors theory
does not include matter in the bone.

143
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,228
- Let's see if they're bone or something else.
- Like what?

144
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,916
Let's pretend we're objective scientists
and not indulge in conjecture.

145
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,197
Zack, get a driver
to take you over to Greenbelt Park.

146
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,308
I want you to take pictures of where the body
was found. Ground covering, paved areas.

147
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,709
- Why does he need a driver?
- I can't drive.

148
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,112
- You're a genius who can't drive?
- If you knew what I do, you wouldn't either.

149
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,797
<i>(Bones)</i> Take the file. Get photos of the area
to contextualise the materials we found.

150
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,189
<i>(Booth)</i> Yeah.

151
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,317
Yes. I'll be right there.

152
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,198
That was April Wright's father.

153
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,669
- A victim's dad called you?
- Wife's a wreck.

154
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,548
- They heard Amy's angling for a reprieve.
- Why did he call you?

155
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,598
Because Booth was the agent
that arrested Howard Epps.

156
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,433
I'm pretty sure that evidence is not in the file.

157
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,353
Earlier you said,
"It's a phone number <i>we</i> found."

158
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,750
Wait. We're trying to save someone
<i>you</i> arrested for murder?

159
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:03,392
All right, I think he did it. I think this scumbag
bashed April Wright to death with a tyre iron.

160
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,429
We've found anomalies in the case. You want
us to stop before they become meaningful?

161
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,239
No. Stay on it. I gotta get going.

162
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,236
You guys are pathetic. It's Friday night.

163
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,835
There's nothing pathetic about
pro bono work on a death-penalty case.

164
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,070
Everybody, this is Troy.

165
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,720
Hey, how you doing?

166
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,675
- Could you just wait here one second?
- Yeah.

167
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,790
Why did you call me in?

168
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,792
Look at this guy.
He's cuter than a monkey with a puppy.

169
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,871
Uh-huh.

170
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,873
I really, really need you to do texture analysis
on seven-year-old X-rays.

171
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,270
But I am on a date. With Troy.

172
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,750
He's a man. Wave.

173
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,557
- What's the big steaming gigantic rush?
- A man is scheduled to die in 26 hours.

174
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,235
I think he'd like the results
of our findings before then.

175
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,675
Good one.

176
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,877
Troy. Sweetie.

177
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,556
I've got a few things to do around here. Do
you mind just hanging out for a little while?

178
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,632
Sure. No problem.

179
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,999
Let me call the restaurant and tell them we'll
be late. What do you think? Half an hour?

180
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,998
- You better make it an hour, minimum.
- OK.

181
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,714
- Hodgins.
- Recondite codes have a complex cipher.

182
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,030
That's a fun factoid, Zack. Thank you.

183
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,591
12402510221.
That's the number they found on the victim.

184
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,638
You've got a photographic memory,
I'm good with ladies.

185
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,393
It's not a phone number.

186
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,915
Hey.

187
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,719
So, what exactly do they do here?

188
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,109
I thought Angela was an artist.

189
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:45,673
She is. We do mostly forensic identification
and reconstruction of discorporated remains.

190
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,877
My specialty's entomology and particulates.

191
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,997
Ever seen maggots? I just got these in.

192
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,594
Do not talk to him.

193
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,154
Wait in the lounge, baby.
It's up those stairs right over there.

194
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,437
- Don't talk to anybody.
- OK.

195
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,555
- What'd you find?
- A shard of bone. How'd they miss that?

196
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,473
They're not as good as we are.

197
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,676
40-times magnification.

198
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,358
Well, that's not bone. It's inorganic.

199
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,034
Mineral. Possibly quartz.

200
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,398
I was taking pictures. There was a sign
and numbers. Why assume a quasi-random...

201
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,109
Zack, when you talk that fast,
human beings can't hear you.

202
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,875
The number they found on the girl,
12402510221.

203
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,793
Everyone assumed it was a phone number,
but what if,

204
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,749
instead of spacing the numbers
like a phone number, you space 'em like this?

205
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:05,870
I was in the park taking pictures,
and I saw the parking space was numbered.

206
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,190
To get to picnic area 10,

207
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,829
you go through gate 25.

208
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,436
- Seems more than a coincidence.
- 1240 - what do those represent?

209
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,115
The time, 12:40, when she was gonna meet
whoever she was meeting.

210
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,430
<i>(Hodgins)</i> It fits with the timeline.

211
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,753
- He's weird, but he's smart.
- April Wright was setting up a date.

212
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,594
Probably with the guy
who left the pubic hair on her.

213
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,480
- Good job, Zack.
- I got something.

214
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,270
It's not quite so idiot savant,
but it's aggregate gravel.

215
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,430
What if the rest of the shadows
on the X-rays were also gravel?

216
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,751
There was no gravel
where her body was found. It was all grass.

217
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,559
Then she was killed someplace else.

218
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,273
We have to exhume our victim's body.

219
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,597
It's stressful waiting for this to be over,
and now Epps is trying for a reprieve.

220
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,079
I heard.

221
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,439
He got a lawyer from the Innocence Project.
They don't consider the family of the victims.

222
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,195
You remember our lawyer, David Ross.
Agent Booth caught Epps.

223
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,159
- Is this ever gonna be over?
- I understand how difficult this is.

224
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,836
- Epps killed my daughter. You believe that?
- Yes, ma'am. I haven't changed my mind.

225
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,754
- He deserves to die for what he did.
- The jury and the judge thought so.

226
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,479
- All these appeals...
- It's part of the process.

227
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,120
Each effort to stop his execution is desperate.

228
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,637
This one won't work either. It's the third time.
It'll be the third time they fail.

229
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,678
It's the last picture we have of April.

230
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,751
<i>(Mr Wright)</i> She wanted to be a lawyer.

231
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,230
David was her role model.
He gave her ajob at his firm on weekends.

232
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,279
- She was a good worker.
- Mm. She was a beautiful girl.

233
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,555
<i>(phone rings)</i>

234
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,313
Excuse me.

235
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,432
- It's OK.
- Booth.

236
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,239
- I'm with Amy.
- <i>I don't like the sound of that.</i>

237
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,518
- We're gonna try to get an exhumation order.
- What? Why?

238
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,628
April may not have been killed
where they found her body. You want details?

239
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,553
- It's not a good time.
- We need to look at her remains.

240
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,870
- Zach decoded the phone number.
- What?

241
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,669
It's not a phone number. April met someone
the night she was murdered.

242
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,150
- So she met someone. What does that prove?
- Is this about April?

243
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,708
- Let me get back to you.
- What's happening now?

244
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,873
- Apparently new evidence has surfaced.
- What kind of evidence?

245
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,033
Give me a few minutes with Agent Booth.
Let me evaluate these developments.

246
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,918
Let's get some coffee.

247
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,191
<i>(David)</i> Yeah.

248
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,155
So this new evidence,
is this something they can bear to hear?

249
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,119
It concerns the person April had sex with
the night she was murdered.

250
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,431
- The judge ruled that irrelevant.
- It's always hung there.

251
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:08,197
It's always the basis of the appeal. If we could
ID the guy, this whole issue would disappear.

252
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,397
It was sex in a car.
It was probably another teenager.

253
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,473
- A kid scared to come forward.
- Nobody said anything about sex in the car.

254
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,872
It was a parking lot.
I assume the sex act took place inside a car.

255
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,509
When April worked for your firm
on weekends, did she do the filing?

256
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,670
- That's right.
- Who was in the office?

257
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,116
- Why do you ask?
- Well, a 17-year-old girl.

258
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,637
I'm sure you just wouldn't
leave her in there all by herself.

259
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,874
What? You can't remember? I'm sure the
security logs'll be able to tell us something.

260
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,636
Refresh my memory, Mr Ross. Where
were you the night that April was killed?

261
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,553
Say around 12:30?

262
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,711
Now's the time
that I ask for my lawyer and say nothing.

263
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,118
- So, are you seeing each other?
- Who?

264
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,273
- You and Booth.
- No. No, we're working together.

265
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,238
Cos I'm picking up a bit of a sex vibe.

266
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,718
No. That's tension.

267
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,791
He has a girlfriend.

268
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,997
- Tall, blonde, beautiful?
- A lawyer.

269
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,071
Figures.

270
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,679
- Should've jumped him. I had the chance.
- You're interested in Booth?

271
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,035
- You aren't?
- No.

272
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,318
- Well, then why are you helping him?
- Because he asked me. He said please.

273
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,515
<i>(laughs)</i>

274
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,512
Come on. You think he's hot.

275
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,353
No. Not at all. This is a very interesting case.

276
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,477
Booth did say you had
some kind of mania for the truth.

277
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,154
Mania? As in maniac?

278
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,038
I'm not sure he meant it as a bad thing.

279
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,949
Which obviously is how you're taking it.

280
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,391
Do you want to start or shall I?

281
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,471
- I'm sorry, sir.
- I'll start.

282
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,994
I'm thinking of suspending you

283
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,959
for freelancing on a death-penalty case
we cleared seven years ago.

284
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,793
My intention was just
to tie up a few loose ends.

285
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,318
- Do you disapprove of the death penalty?
- No, sir. I have no problem with it.

286
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,313
Because I hear that you're working
for an attractive, young, idealist...

287
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,109
Not true, sir. I mean, yes,
she's young and she's an idealist,

288
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,589
but I'm not working for her. No.

289
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,274
Like I said, there was a loose end,

290
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,990
and I arrested Howard Epps. I provided
the evidence which led to the death sentence.

291
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,789
- That's yourjob.
- I must be sure. This guy was her godfather.

292
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,759
I believe he had sex with
a 17-year-old girl the night she was murdered.

293
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,274
A fact that the jury never heard, by the way.

294
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,797
He's married. He's partners in a law firm.
The guy's got everything to lose.

295
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,792
If you want to question him, fine.

296
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,630
Is that the end of your involvement,
Agent Booth?

297
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:58,234
Not exactly. They're moving
to exhume the victim's body, sir.

298
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,914
On whose recommendation?

299
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,036
The young idealist lawyer,

300
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,315
and Dr Brennan.

301
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,515
Got the squints involved.

302
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,152
Well, if she shoots anybody this time,
I sure the hell hope it's you.

303
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,314
<i>(man) These are not the robes I wear to work.</i>

304
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,793
- Sir, if you could tie your dressing gown?
- It's one in the morning. Deal with it.

305
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,872
So, you found a piece of bone
the size of a toothpick.

306
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,670
Yes. A shard from her left triquetral
with gravel embedded in it.

307
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,274
Describe the implications.

308
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,798
The jury was told that these shadows here
were bits of bone shattered during the attack.

309
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,238
Through digital techniques, Dr Brennars
team found that the density of the fragments

310
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,436
is not the same as the surrounding bone.

311
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,435
- What are they?
- The only way I can tell is by looking at them.

312
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,239
- You want to exhume April Wright?
- Yes, please.

313
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,995
- Because of shadows on an X-ray?
- I don't see another alternative.

314
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:08,428
Dr Brennan, if those shadows turned out
to be pieces of bone, I'd be extremely angry.

315
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,193
- Thanks, Judge Cohen.
- For making a veiled threat?

316
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,276
I thought you were threatening me because
you'd decided to sign the exhumation order.

317
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,630
<i>I did not kill April Wright. There...</i>

318
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,433
<i>there are good people out there.</i>

319
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,193
<i>You know, people who believe me.</i>

320
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,590
<i>People who know I did not kill that girl</i>
<i>cos they saw the evidence.</i>

321
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,715
I honestly think he's innocent. Don't you?

322
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,429
I don't like to form any conclusions
before all the evidence is in.

323
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,354
- <i>(man)</i> Watch your step.
- April Wright's body just arrived.

324
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,758
You might be more comfortable staying here.

325
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,394
- L-I can't.
- Oh, God!

326
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,951
- Don't look, sweetie.
- You're not an artist. You're a freak.

327
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,713
You people are all freaks.

328
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,077
This job is so hard to describe online.

329
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,948
The left triquetral.

330
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,835
- It's a match. For the record, do you concur?
- I concur.

331
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,795
- We've got foreign material in the bone.
- <i>(Hodgins)</i> It's the same stuff in the shard.

332
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,156
Which is consistent with
being dragged through gravel.

333
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,358
I searched the house of the guy April
had sex with the night she was murdered.

334
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,795
- What did you find?
- Underwear.

335
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,997
Can you run a comparison on the hair?

336
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,475
- <i>(Booth)</i> Is that April Wright?
- She wasrt killed where she was found.

337
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,676
Then where was she murdered?

338
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,435
We've got particles beaten into the skull.
Were these ever ID'd?

339
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,512
According to the autopsy report, no.

340
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,274
- It's a visual match.
- Will you backstop him on that?

341
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,511
- Where's Amy?
- I'm here. I can't...

342
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,229
It's OK. Things can get pretty,
you know, disgusting around here.

343
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,517
I concur with Zack.
We have a visual match on the pubic hair.

344
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,319
Is a visual match enough
to stop the execution?

345
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,551
- We need DNA to be sure.
- <i>(Bones)</i> Amy's right.

346
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,189
This evidence isn't enough
to stop the execution.

347
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,477
And you've got nothing else? Nothing at all?

348
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,199
I don't know what else we can do.

349
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:54,355
If you tell the judge you've changed
your mind, that Howard Epps is not guilty...

350
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,431
- Have you changed your mind?
- No.

351
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,718
I have doubts that the guy
should be executed, but...

352
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,351
Let's go see the judge.

353
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,032
At my age, a man needs a good night's sleep.

354
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,680
Lack of sleep clouds judgment.

355
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,230
If you stay the execution,
I promise, you'll sleep like a baby.

356
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,390
What does the prosecution think?

357
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,314
This is a waste of the state's time.
Miss Morton is recycling evidence,

358
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,757
presenting it differently in a last-ditch attempt
to stop Epps being executed.

359
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,400
- She's an ideologue.
- That's true.

360
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,189
But it doesn't mean I'm not right.
This case doesn't add up.

361
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,751
You, brilliant scientist lady,
talk to me about this bone shard.

362
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,072
It indicates the body was dragged
to where it was discovered. Plus the gravel...

363
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,038
Common gravel. I'm not convinced.
What about the hair?

364
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,749
A visual match.
That narrows the statistical probability to...

365
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,434
- DNA?
- Ten days. We'll have it in ten days.

366
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,354
What about this man that the FBI's
taken into custody? David Ross.

367
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,715
- Has he confessed to sleeping with her?
- No.

368
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,429
Even if David Ross slept with the girl,
it doesn't prove he killed her.

369
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,351
Let's stick with new facts.

370
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,750
At least give us time to find his car.
There could be evidence...

371
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,150
I can't stop an execution
because there "could be" evidence.

372
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,915
Judge Cohen,
I have the arresting officer right here.

373
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,753
The primary investigator.

374
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:37,591
Agent Booth, have you suddenly decided
that Howard Epps is not guilty?

375
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,874
- No.
- Booth!

376
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,875
- There are doubts and there shouldn't be any.
- He doesn't have doubts. He has cold feet.

377
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,872
Think I won't pop you one
cos we're in the judge's kitchen?

378
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,430
<i>(Judge Cohen)</i> You see?
You lose sleep, you get cranky.

379
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,556
Judgment suffers. It's not enough.

380
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,837
- You can't dismiss this so easily.
- Easily?

381
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,072
I allowed you to exhume that girl's remains.
Do you think I did that easily?

382
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,995
We all feel the weight of a capital case,
Miss Morton, but the law is clear.

383
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,356
Unless there is proof
of grievous incompetence by counsel

384
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,319
or a denial of legitimate
and definitive factual certainties,

385
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,550
my hands are tied.

386
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,278
- I'll go out to the prison and tell Epps.
- I'll take another look at the skull.

387
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,113
- Bones...
- The particulates haven't been analysed.

388
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,398
This is so barbaric! When are they gonna
put a stop to the damn death penalty?

389
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,677
- I believe in the death penalty.
- What?

390
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,274
Certain people shouldn't be in this world.

391
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,478
The people who hacked hundreds
of innocent children to death in Rwanda,

392
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,393
beheaded them at their desks at school,

393
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,075
the people who did that,
they should be executed.

394
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,039
- So why do you care about Epps?
- Because the facts have to add up.

395
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,597
Drop me at the lab, please.

396
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,910
Last meal.

397
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,037
I can't decide.

398
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,477
- What's the last taste that I want?
- Howard, I am so sorry.

399
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,153
Dr Brennan is still working on a few ideas.

400
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,199
You see the truth.
You know I'm innocent, right?

401
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,840
I know there's a chance you're not guilty.

402
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,037
Well, that's good enough for me.

403
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,550
A chance, I said. All right? A chance.

404
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,158
- <i>(Hodgins)</i> These are slivers of metal.
- <i>(Zack)</i> Probably from the tyre iron.

405
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,953
- <i>(Bones)</i> Is that blood?
- Silt. I'm breaking it down.

406
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,794
- It contains traces of two chemicals.
- Anthracene and fluoranthene.

407
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,350
I've scanned in all the X-rays
and built a 3-D module.

408
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,079
Troy would've liked that. Bastard.

409
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:50,871
I found some more material
in the fractures along the sagittal suture.

410
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,188
<i>(Hodgins)</i> It's pollen.

411
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,950
The pollen is from <i>Spartina alterniflora</i>, more
commonly known as smooth cord grass.

412
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,032
Sorry, what does pollen tell us
about April's murder?

413
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,111
Angela?

414
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,798
The murder weapon collected pollen
from the surrounding flora.

415
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,910
When she was struck, pollen from the murder
weapon was deposited in April's skull.

416
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,429
<i>Spartina alterniflora</i>
is only found along Chesapeake Bay.

417
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,432
The pollen and silt
both showed traces of chemicals.

418
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,479
- What does that mean?
- April died in a marsh near a chemical plant.

419
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,357
<i>(phone rings)</i>

420
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,510
Amy Morton.

421
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,352
Thanks.

422
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,750
- They've moved Epps to the imminent room.
- What's that?

423
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,276
It's where he has his last meal
and says goodbye to his family.

424
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,830
We need the location of that marsh.

425
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,397
The hair proves you had sex with April.
You're gonna be charged with statutory rape.

426
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,756
But not by you.
Statutory rape is not a federal crime,

427
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,628
so I'm left to assume you're here
to get my client to confess to murder.

428
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,598
- It adds up. It tracks.
- I didn't kill April.

429
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,389
You met April in the park,
but she was killed near a chemical plant?

430
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,313
- I don't know.
- You had sex. She threatened to tell.

431
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,756
You couldn't let that happen.
You'd lose your business.

432
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,035
- No.
- Do not engage with him, David.

433
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,714
- You had motive, opportunity.
- I didn't kill her.

434
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,597
- Why aren't you helping?
- What?

435
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,753
By not admitting that you were there
that night, you're clouding the issue.

436
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,400
So what? Epps will still be in jail for life.

437
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,630
We are not discussing that night.

438
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,518
You are the only person
who can tell us what happened.

439
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,993
- Do you care about what happened to her?
- I went there that night to talk, OK? That's all.

440
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,437
- This interview is over.
- Just to talk. I'm not proud of what happened.

441
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:58,675
I can tell you exactly why it happened, but I'm
not proud of it. I shouldn't have got pulled in.

442
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,469
I didn't know it was her first time
and she'd get so upset. She ran off.

443
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,838
- Are you telling me you left her in that park?
- No! I looked for her for two hours.

444
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,150
I figured she called somebody to get her.

445
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,754
Was her car still there when you left?

446
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,876
- Yes, it was.
- What time was that?

447
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,871
- After 2am.
- Did you see anyone?

448
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,112
Yeah, there was some traffic, all teenagers.
After 1am, there was nothing.

449
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,510
Look, maybe it is my fault that he got to her.

450
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,395
You know, maybe I should go to jail for that.

451
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,911
He admits to having sex with her?

452
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,389
- Yes, sir.
- Did he kill her?

453
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,029
Well, he's either telling the truth
or he's setting up his defence.

454
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,432
So April Wright met David Ross
for a sexual liaison.

455
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,910
He took her to a second, unknown location,

456
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,037
beat her to death,
and deposited the body back at the park.

457
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,157
- That's sketchy.
- Which is why we have to find the weapon.

458
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,279
Find a tyre iron in a marsh after seven years?
That's a long shot.

459
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,511
That's why we need metal detectors and GPR.

460
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,512
And a dozen or so agents, sir.

461
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,310
And if you find this tyre iron, you can
positively identify it as the murder weapon?

462
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,075
It's possible we can match
the traces we found in April's skull.

463
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,196
Possible? No.

464
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,432
Epps' lawyer should present this argument
to the judge and let him decide.

465
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,957
Sir, without the murder weapon,
he will not stay the execution.

466
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,715
Way out on a limb here, Booth.

467
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:33,351
He's just trying to find the truth.
Why should he be penalised for...?

468
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,594
- Take the equipment and the men.
- Thank you.

469
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,719
- She can't have a gun.
- No gun. Absolutely not. No. Thank you, sir.

470
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,435
We have GPR,
and more agents will meet us out there.

471
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,592
We'll have four devices
so we'll cover a lot of ground.

472
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,189
I'm plugging in the data
to get the location with the closest match.

473
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,831
Given the chemicals in the soil, I'd say
we're looking for a spot near Rock Hall plant.

474
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,630
We'll have video when we get to the bay, and
I need pictures of the grass we're looking for.

475
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,039
OK.

476
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,838
There are four areas
that have <i>Spartina alterniflora</i>.

477
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,798
<i>It's a muddy area. Knee-high grass.</i>

478
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,838
<i>OK, go back one screen.</i>

479
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,480
It's just off that service road.

480
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,958
<i>(metal detector beeps)</i>

481
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,515
We got it. We got it.

482
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,354
- <i>(man)</i> Let me know what you pull up.
- We've got the tyre iron.

483
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,113
<i>(man #2)</i> Over here.
There's something else here.

484
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,671
Here. I got something.
It's more than a tyre iron.

485
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,629
- Is that what I think it is?
- I need a shov...

486
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,714
- I need a shovel. She's digging here.
- <i>(woman)</i> Right away, sir.

487
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,597
Ma'am.

488
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,398
Agent Booth?

489
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,032
- Are you gonna help?
- Well, I would but this is a $1200 suit.

490
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,758
Are you kidding me? I haven't slept in
48 hours and you're worried about your suit?

491
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,513
Get over here.

492
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,795
Fine. Can I get a shovel?

493
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,871
Thanks.

494
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,755
<i>(Bones)</i> Dig gently, small layers at a time.

495
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,193
- What would you usually be doing?
- What?

496
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,034
- If it were a normal weekend.
- You want to discuss this now?

497
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,680
Compared to you with multiple sex partners...

498
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,990
That's none of your business, OK?

499
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,355
I'm not having sex with Amy,

500
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,228
and I have never ever cheated on any woman
that I've ever been with.

501
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,193
Never!

502
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,193
- I just asked what you'd normally be doing.
- I'd be at a movie, dancing.

503
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,840
Being with somebody that I care about.

504
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,751
You?

505
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,597
What the hell's going on here?

506
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,319
Female, approximately 17 to 25 years old,

507
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,228
blunt trauma to the skull.

508
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,996
Also female, same approximate age,
same type of injury.

509
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:24,438
This doesn't fit with Ross. If he killed April,
it was a panic murder - personal, not serial.

510
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,513
Both these victims have been dead
for at least five years.

511
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,398
- Maybe more than seven?
- Yes.

512
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,152
Epps. It was Epps.

513
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:40,917
He snatched April after she ran from Ross
and brought her here to his killing grounds.

514
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,755
- Why did he take her back to the park?
- He watched them have sex, saw them argue.

515
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,549
Epps knew suspicions would fall on Ross
and took her back.

516
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,790
And stole her car.

517
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,758
- We got played.
- What? How?

518
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,752
Either way, Epps wins.

519
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,992
We find Ross, the execution is stopped.
We find these bodies...

520
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,359
The execution is stayed
until these murders are investigated.

521
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,714
If I don't make this call,

522
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,439
he's gonna be dead in half an hour.

523
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,279
<i>(Bones)</i> But these women,
they deserve to be heard.

524
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,510
It's what we do, Booth.

525
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,795
- The rest...
- Lawyers.

526
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,549
Lawyers.

527
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,556
Amy, it's Booth.

528
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,829
I think we got you your stay of execution,
but you're not gonna like it much.

529
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,195
Thank you.

530
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,875
- All I can say is thank you.
- What's that, Howie?

531
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,758
Practising to getjury sympathy?

532
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,240
I did not kill anyone.

533
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,355
Thank you.

534
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,873
I mean it.

535
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,112
We found the tyre iron.
You'll be found guilty of these murders.

536
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,200
Well, I need a good lawyer.

537
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,716
These murder investigations take a long time.

538
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,238
Then there's the appeals.

539
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,752
And since I should've been dead
a half an hour ago,

540
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,354
it's all gravy from now on.

541
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,435
We gave him everything he wanted.

542
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,274
Who knows if there'll even be
a death penalty then?

543
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,874
I mean, that's your dream, isn't it?

544
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,838
We want the same things from life.

545
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,635
And I owe you too.

546
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,279
I read your book.

547
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:19,593
When I heard you were working with Booth
here, I knew you were just what I needed.

548
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,509
- You gonna arrest me for assault?
- From what I saw, purely self-defence.

549
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:35,072
- Maybe I shouldn't carry a gun after all.
- Hell, you can have mine.

550
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,952
- What's the matter with you two?
- Bad day at work.

551
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,759
Well, that's what you get
for working on weekends.

552
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,674
You ever hear about taking some time off,
having a little fun?

553
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,718
Why? What did you do?

554
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,511
I'd be breaking about six laws if I just told you
how I manoeuvred on my Saturday nights.

555
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,951
- But I will bring you some food.
- I'm not hungry.

556
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,589
No use arguing with Sid, Bones.

557
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,033
- Are you in trouble with your boss?
- <i>(groans)</i>

558
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,433
I'm sorry for wrecking your weekend
for nothing.

559
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,238
No, not for nothing.

560
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,517
You know what I mean.

561
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,319
You know, all that running around,

562
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,914
it didn't change anything.

563
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,309
Epps was guilty. He was always guilty.

564
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,391
There was doubt.

565
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,029
We had an obligation to respect that doubt.

566
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,351
We all share in the death
of every human being.

567
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,874
- Very poetic.
- No. Very literal.

568
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,118
We all share DNA.

569
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,910
When I look at a bone, it's not some artefact
that I can separate from myself,

570
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,152
it's a part of a person
who got here the same way I did.

571
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,471
It should never be easy
to take someone's life.

572
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,438
I don't care who it is.

573
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,671
What?

574
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,356
What?

575
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:18,151
You've been practising your
Nobel-prize speech just a little too much.

576
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,152
Scallops in Szechwan garlic sauce,
duck fried rice.

577
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,869
- Here you go.
- Apple pie, hot cup ofjoe.

578
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,640
<i>(Sid)</i> To simple pleasures, my friends.

579
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,631
Simple pleasures.
